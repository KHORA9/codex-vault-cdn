Throughout this little work, I shall _number_ the Paragraphs, in order\r\nto be able, at some stages of the work, to refer, with the more facility,\r\nto parts that have gone before. The last Number will contain an _Index_,\r\nby the means of which the several matters may be turned to without loss of\r\ntime; for, when _economy_ is the subject, _time_ is a thing which ought by\r\nno means to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n2. The word _Economy_, like a great many others, has, in its application,\r\nbeen very much abused. It is generally used as if it meant parsimony,\r\nstinginess, or niggardliness; and, at best, merely the refraining from\r\nexpending money. Hence misers and close-fisted men disguise their\r\npropensity and conduct under the name of _economy_; whereas the most\r\nliberal disposition, a disposition precisely the contrary of that of the\r\nmiser, is perfectly consistent with economy.\r\n\r\n3. ECONOMY means _management_, and nothing more; and it is generally\r\napplied to the affairs of a house and family, which affairs are an object\r\nof the greatest importance, whether as relating to individuals or to a\r\nnation. A nation is made powerful and to be honoured in the world, not so\r\nmuch by the number of its people as by the ability and character of that\r\npeople; and the ability and character of a people depend, in a great\r\nmeasure, upon the _economy_ of the several families, which, all taken\r\ntogether, make up the nation. There never yet was, and never will be, a\r\nnation _permanently great_, consisting, for the greater part, of wretched\r\nand miserable families.\r\n\r\n4. In every view of the matter, therefore, it is desirable; that the\r\nfamilies of which a nation consists should be happily off: and as this\r\ndepends, in a great degree, upon the _management_ of their concerns, the\r\npresent work is intended to convey, to the families of the _labouring\r\nclasses_ in particular, such information as I think may be useful with\r\nregard to that management.\r\n\r\n5. I lay it down as a maxim, that for a family to be happy, they must be\r\nwell supplied with _food_ and _raiment_. It is a sorry effort that people\r\nmake to persuade others, or to persuade themselves, that they can be happy\r\nin a state of _want_ of the necessaries of life. The doctrines which\r\nfanaticism preaches, and which teach men to be _content_ with _poverty_,\r\nhave a very pernicious tendency, and are calculated to favour tyrants by\r\ngiving them passive slaves. To live well, to enjoy all things that make\r\nlife pleasant, is the right of every man who constantly uses his strength\r\njudiciously and lawfully. It is to blaspheme God to suppose, that he\r\ncreated man to be miserable, to hunger, thirst, and perish with cold, in\r\nthe midst of that abundance which is the fruit of their own labour.\r\nInstead, therefore, of applauding \"_happy_ poverty,\" which applause is so\r\nmuch the fashion of the present day, I despise the man that is _poor_ and\r\n_contented_; for, such content is a certain proof of a base disposition, a\r\ndisposition which is the enemy of all industry, all exertion, all love of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n6. Let it be understood, however, that, by _poverty_, I mean _real want_,\r\na real insufficiency of the food and raiment and lodging necessary to\r\nhealth and decency; and not that imaginary poverty, of which some persons\r\ncomplain. The man who, by his own and his family's labour, can provide a\r\nsufficiency of food and raiment, and a comfortable dwelling-place, is not\r\na _poor man_. There must be different ranks and degrees in every civil\r\nsociety, and, indeed, so it is even amongst the savage tribes. There must\r\nbe different degrees of wealth; some must have more than others; and the\r\nrichest must be a great deal richer than the least rich. But it is\r\nnecessary to the very existence of a people, that nine out of ten should\r\nlive wholly by the sweat of their brow; and, is it not degrading to human\r\nnature, that all the nine-tenths should be called _poor_; and, what is\r\nstill worse, _call themselves poor_, and be _contented_ in that degraded\r\nstate?\r\n\r\n7. The laws, the economy, or management, of a state may be such as to\r\nrender it impossible for the labourer, however skilful and industrious, to\r\nmaintain his family in health and decency; and such has, for many years\r\npast, been the management of the affairs of this once truly great and\r\nhappy land. A system of paper-money, the effect of which was to take from\r\nthe labourer the half of his earnings, was what no industry and care could\r\nmake head against. I do not pretend that this system was adopted _by\r\ndesign_. But, no matter for the _cause_; such was the effect.\r\n\r\n8. Better times, however, are approaching. The labourer now appears likely\r\nto obtain that hire of which he is worthy; and, therefore, this appears to\r\nme to be the time to press upon him the _duty_ of using his best exertions\r\nfor the rearing of his family in a manner that must give him the best\r\nsecurity for happiness to himself, his wife and children, and to make him,\r\nin all respects, what his forefathers were. The people of England have\r\nbeen famed, in all ages, for their _good living_; for the _abundance of\r\ntheir food_ and _goodness of their attire_. The old sayings about English\r\nroast beef and plum-pudding, and about English hospitality, had not their\r\nfoundation in _nothing_. And, in spite of all refinements of sickly minds,\r\nit is _abundant living_ amongst the people at large, which is the great\r\ntest of good government, and the surest basis of national greatness and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n9. If the labourer have his fair wages; if there be no false weights and\r\nmeasures, whether of money or of goods, by which he is defrauded; if the\r\nlaws be equal in their effect upon all men: if he be called upon for no\r\nmore than his due share of the expenses necessary to support the\r\ngovernment and defend the country, he has no reason to complain. If the\r\nlargeness of his family demand extraordinary labour and care, these are\r\ndue from him to it. He is the cause of the existence of that family; and,\r\ntherefore, he is not, except in cases of accidental calamity, to throw\r\nupon others the burden of supporting it. Besides, \"little children are as\r\narrows in the hands of the giant, and blessed is the man that hath his\r\nquiver full of them.\" That is to say, children, if they bring their\r\n_cares_, bring also their _pleasures_ and _solid advantages_. They become,\r\nvery soon, so many assistants and props to the parents, who, when old age\r\ncomes on, are amply repaid for all the toils and all the cares that\r\nchildren have occasioned in their infancy. To be without sure and safe\r\nfriends in the world makes life not worth having; and whom can we be so\r\nsure of as of our children? Brothers and sisters are a mutual support. We\r\nsee them, in almost every case, grow up into prosperity, when they act the\r\npart that the impulses of nature prescribe. When cordially united, a\r\nfather and sons, or a family of brothers and sisters, may, in almost any\r\nstate of life, set what is called misfortune at defiance.\r\n\r\n10. These considerations are much more than enough to sweeten the toils\r\nand cares of parents, and to make them regard every additional child as an\r\nadditional blessing. But, that children may be a blessing and not a curse,\r\ncare must be taken of their _education_. This word has, of late years,\r\nbeen so perverted, so corrupted; so abused, in its application, that I am\r\nalmost afraid to use it here. Yet I must not suffer it to be usurped by\r\ncant and tyranny. I must use it: but not without clearly saying what I\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n11. _Education_ means _breeding up_, _bringing up_, or _rearing up_; and\r\nnothing more. This includes every thing with regard to the _mind_ as well\r\nas the _body_ of a child; but, of late years, it has been so used as to\r\nhave no sense applied to it but that of _book-learning_, with which, nine\r\ntimes out of ten, it has nothing at all to do. It is, indeed, proper, and\r\nit is the duty of all parents, to teach, or cause to be taught, their\r\nchildren as much as they can of books, _after_, and not before, all the\r\nmeasures are safely taken for enabling them to get their living by labour,\r\nor for _providing them a living without labour_, and that, too, out of the\r\nmeans obtained and secured by the parents out of their own income. The\r\ntaste of the times is, unhappily, to give to children something of\r\n_book-learning_, with a view of placing them to live, in some way or\r\nother, _upon the labour of other people_. Very seldom, comparatively\r\nspeaking, has this succeeded, even during the wasteful public expenditure\r\nof the last thirty years; and, in the times that are approaching, it\r\ncannot, I thank God, succeed at all. When the project has failed, what\r\ndisappointment, mortification and misery, to both parent and child! The\r\nlatter is spoiled as a labourer: his book-learning has only made him\r\nconceited: into some course of desperation he falls; and the end is but\r\ntoo often not only wretched but ignominious.\r\n\r\n12. Understand me clearly here, however; for it is the duty of parents to\r\ngive, if they be able, book-learning to their children, having _first_\r\ntaken care to make them capable of earning their living by _bodily\r\nlabour_. When that object has once been secured, the other may, if the\r\nability remain, be attended to. But I am wholly against children wasting\r\ntheir time in the idleness of what is called _education_; and particularly\r\nin schools over which the parents have no control, and where nothing is\r\ntaught but the rudiments of servility, pauperism and slavery.\r\n\r\n13. The _education_ that I have in view is, therefore, of a very different\r\nkind. You should bear constantly in mind, that nine-tenths of us are, from\r\nthe very nature and necessities of the world, born to gain our livelihood\r\nby the sweat of our brow. What reason have we, then, to presume, that our\r\nchildren are not to do the same? If they be, as now and then one will be,\r\nendued with extraordinary powers of mind, those powers may have an\r\nopportunity of developing themselves; and if they never have that\r\nopportunity, the harm is not very great to us or to them. Nor does it\r\nhence follow that the descendants of labourers are _always_ to be\r\nlabourers. The path upwards is steep and long, to be sure. Industry, care,\r\nskill, excellence, in the present parent, lay the foundation of _a rise_,\r\nunder more favourable circumstances, for his children. The children of\r\nthese take _another rise_; and, by-and-by, the descendants of the present\r\nlabourer become gentlemen.\r\n\r\n14. This is the natural progress. It is by attempting to reach the top at\r\na _single leap_ that so much misery is produced in the world; and the\r\npropensity to make such attempts has been cherished and encouraged by the\r\nstrange projects that we have witnessed of late years for making the\r\nlabourers _virtuous_ and _happy_ by giving them what is called\r\n_education_. The education which I speak of consists in bringing children\r\nup to labour with _steadiness_, with _care_, and with _skill_; to show\r\nthem how to do as many useful things as possible; to teach them to do them\r\nall in the best manner; to set them an example in industry, sobriety,\r\ncleanliness, and neatness; to make all these _habitual_ to them, so that\r\nthey never shall be liable to fall into the contrary; to let them always\r\nsee a _good living_ proceeding from _labour_, and thus to remove from them\r\nthe temptation to get at the goods of others by violent or fraudulent\r\nmeans; and to keep far from their minds all the inducements to hypocrisy\r\nand deceit.\r\n\r\n15. And, bear in mind, that if the state of the labourer has its\r\ndisadvantages when compared with other callings and conditions of life, it\r\nhas also its advantages. It is free from the torments of ambition, and\r\nfrom a great part of the causes of ill-health, for which not all the\r\nriches in the world and all the circumstances of high rank are a\r\ncompensation. The able and prudent labourer is always _safe_, at the\r\nleast; and that is what few men are who are lifted above him. They have\r\nlosses and crosses to fear, the very thought of which never enters his\r\nmind, if he act well his part towards himself, his family and his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n16. But, the basis of good to him, is _steady and skilful labour_. To\r\nassist him in the pursuit of this labour, and in the turning of it to the\r\nbest account, are the principal objects of the present little work. I\r\npropose to treat of brewing Beer, making Bread, keeping Cows and Pigs,\r\nrearing Poultry, and of other matters; and to show, that, while, from a\r\nvery small piece of ground a large part of the food of a considerable\r\nfamily may be raised, the very act of raising it will be the best possible\r\nfoundation of _education_ of the children of the labourer; that it will\r\nteach them a great number of useful things, _add greatly to their value\r\nwhen they go forth from_ their father's home, make them start in life with\r\nall possible advantages, and give them the best chance of leading happy\r\nlives. And is it not much more rational for parents to be employed in\r\nteaching their children how to cultivate a garden, to feed and rear\r\nanimals, to make bread, beer, bacon, butter and cheese, and to be able to\r\ndo these things for themselves, or for others, than to leave them to prowl\r\nabout the lanes and commons, or to mope at the heels of some crafty,\r\nsleekheaded pretended saint, who while he extracts the last penny from\r\ntheir pockets, bids them be contented with their misery, and promises\r\nthem, in exchange for their pence, everlasting glory in the world to come?\r\nIt is upon the hungry and the wretched that the fanatic works. The\r\ndejected and forlorn are his prey. As an ailing carcass engenders vermin,\r\na pauperized community engenders teachers of fanaticism, the very\r\nfoundation of whose doctrines is, that we are to care nothing about this\r\nworld, and that all our labours and exertions are in vain.\r\n\r\n17. The man, who is doing well, who is in good health, who has a blooming\r\nand dutiful and cheerful and happy family about him, and who passes his\r\nday of rest amongst them, is not to be made to believe, that he was born\r\nto be miserable, and that poverty, the natural and just reward of\r\nlaziness, is to secure him a crown of glory. Far be it from me to\r\nrecommend a disregard of even outward observances as to matters of\r\nreligion; but, can it be _religion_ to believe that God hath made us to be\r\nwretched and dejected? Can it be _religion_ to regard, as marks of his\r\ngrace, the poverty and misery that almost invariably attend our neglect to\r\nuse the means of obtaining a competence in worldly things? Can it be\r\n_religion_ to regard as blessings those things, those very things, which\r\nGod expressly numbers amongst his curses? Poverty never finds a place\r\namongst the _blessings_ promised by God. His blessings are of a directly\r\nopposite description; flocks, herds, corn, wine and oil; a smiling land; a\r\nrejoicing people; abundance for the body and gladness of the heart: these\r\nare the blessings which God promises to the industrious, the sober, the\r\ncareful, and the upright. Let no man, then, believe that, to be poor and\r\nwretched is a mark of God's favour; and let no man remain in that state,\r\nif he, by any honest means, can rescue himself from it.\r\n\r\n18. Poverty leads to all sorts of evil consequences. _Want_, horrid want,\r\nis the great parent of crime. To have a dutiful family, the father's\r\nprinciple of rule must be _love_ not _fear_. His sway must be gentle, or\r\nhe will have only an unwilling and short-lived obedience. But it is given\r\nto but few men to be gentle and good-humoured amidst the various torments\r\nattendant on pinching poverty. A competence is, therefore, the first thing\r\nto be thought of; it is the foundation of all good in the labourer's\r\ndwelling; without it little but misery can be expected. \"_Health_,\r\n_peace_, and _competence_,\" one of the wisest of men regards as the only\r\nthings needful to man: but the two former are scarcely to be had without\r\nthe latter. _Competence_ is the foundation of happiness and of exertion.\r\nBeset with wants, having a mind continually harassed with fears of\r\nstarvation, who can act with energy, who can calmly think? To provide a\r\n_good living_, therefore, for himself and family, is the _very first duty_\r\nof every man. \"Two things,\" says AGUR, \"have I asked; deny me them not\r\nbefore I die: remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty\r\nnor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full and deny\r\nthee; or lest I be poor and steal.\"\r\n\r\n19. A _good living_ therefore, a _competence_, is the first thing to be\r\ndesired and to be sought after; and, if this little work should have the\r\neffect of aiding only a small portion of the Labouring Classes in securing\r\nthat competence, it will afford great gratification to their friend\r\n\r\nWM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n_Kensington, 19th July, 1821._\r\n\r\n\r\nBREWING BEER.\r\n\r\n20. Before I proceed to give any directions about brewing, let me mention\r\nsome of the inducements to do the thing. In former times, to set about to\r\nshow to Englishmen that it was good for them to brew beer in their houses\r\nwould have been as impertinent as gravely to insist, that they ought to\r\nendeavour not to lose their breath; for, in those times, (only forty years\r\nago,) to have a _house_ and not to brew was a rare thing indeed. Mr.\r\nELLMAN, an old man and a large farmer, in Sussex, has recently given in\r\nevidence, before a Committee of the House of Commons, this fact; that,\r\n_forty years ago_, there was not a labourer in his parish that did not\r\n_brew his own beer_; and that _now_ there is _not one that does it_,\r\nexcept by chance the malt be given him. The causes of this change have\r\nbeen the lowering of the wages of labour, compared with the price of\r\nprovisions, by the means of the paper-money; the enormous tax upon the\r\nbarley when made into _malt_; and the increased tax upon _hops_. These\r\nhave quite changed the customs of the English people as to their drink.\r\nThey still drink _beer_, but, in general, it is of the brewing of _common\r\nbrewers_, and in public-houses, of which the common brewers have become\r\nthe owners, and have thus, by the aid of paper-money, obtained a\r\n_monopoly_ in the supplying of the great body of the people with one of\r\nthose things which, to the hard-working man, is almost a necessary of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n21. These things will be altered. They must be altered. The nation must be\r\nsunk into nothingness, or a new system must be adopted; and the nation\r\nwill not sink into nothingness. The malt now pays a tax of 4_s._ 6_d._[1]\r\na bushel, and the barley costs only 3_s._ This brings the bushel of malt\r\nto 8_s._ including the maltster's charge for malting. If the tax were\r\ntaken off the malt, malt would be sold, at the present price of barley,\r\nfor about 3_s._ 3_d._ a bushel; because a bushel of barley makes more than\r\na bushel of malt, and the tax, besides its amount, causes great expenses\r\nof various sorts to the maltster. The hops pay a tax of 2_d._[2] a pound;\r\nand a bushel of malt requires, in general, a pound of hops; if these two\r\ntaxes were taken off, therefore, the consumption of barley and of hops\r\nwould be exceedingly increased; for double the present quantity would be\r\ndemanded, and the land is always ready to send it forth.\r\n\r\n22. It appears impossible that the landlords should much longer submit to\r\nthese intolerable burdens on their estates. In short, they must get off\r\nthe malt tax, or lose those estates. They must do a great _deal more_,\r\nindeed; but that they must do at any rate. The paper-money is fast losing\r\nits destructive power; and things are, with regard to the labourers,\r\ncoming back to what they were _forty years ago_, and therefore we may\r\nprepare for the making of beer in our own houses, and take leave of the\r\npoisonous stuff served out to us by common brewers. We may begin\r\n_immediately_; for, even at _present prices_, home-brewed beer is the\r\n_cheapest_ drink that a family can use, except _milk_, and milk can be\r\napplicable only in certain cases.\r\n\r\n23. The drink which has come to supply the place of beer has, in general,\r\nbeen _tea_. It is notorious that tea has no _useful strength_ in it; that\r\nit contains nothing _nutritious_; that it, besides being _good_ for\r\nnothing, has _badness_ in it, because it is well known to produce want of\r\nsleep in many cases, and in all cases, to shake and weaken the nerves. It\r\nis, in fact, a weaker kind of laudanum, which enlivens for the moment and\r\ndeadens afterwards. At any rate it communicates no strength to the body;\r\nit does not, in any degree, assist in affording what labour demands. It\r\nis, then, of no _use_. And, now, as to its _cost_, compared with that of\r\n_beer_. I shall make my comparison applicable to a year, or three hundred\r\nand sixty-five days. I shall suppose the tea to be only five shillings the\r\npound; the sugar only sevenpence; the milk only twopence a quart. The\r\nprices are at the very lowest. I shall suppose a tea-pot to cost a\r\nshilling, six cups and saucers two shillings and sixpence, and six pewter\r\nspoons eighteen-pence. How to estimate the firing I hardly know; but\r\ncertainly there must be in the course of the year, two hundred fires made\r\nthat would not be made, were it not for tea drinking. Then comes the great\r\narticle of all, the _time_ employed in this tea-making affair. It is\r\nimpossible to make a fire, boil water, make the tea, drink it, wash up the\r\nthings, sweep up the fire-place, and put all to rights again, in a less\r\nspace of time, upon an average, than _two hours_. However, let us allow\r\n_one hour_; and here we have a woman occupied no less than three hundred\r\nand sixty-five hours in the year, or thirty whole days, at twelve hours in\r\nthe day; that is to say, one month out of the twelve in the year, besides\r\nthe waste of the man's time in hanging about waiting for the tea! Needs\r\nthere any thing more to make us cease to wonder at seeing labourers'\r\nchildren with dirty linen and holes in the heels of their stockings?\r\nObserve, too, that the time thus spent is, one half of it, the best time\r\nof the day. It is the top of the morning, which, in every calling of life,\r\ncontains an hour worth two or three hours of the afternoon. By the time\r\nthat the clattering tea tackle is out of the way, the morning is spoiled;\r\nits prime is gone; and any work that is to be done afterwards lags heavily\r\nalong. If the mother have to go out to work, the tea affair must all first\r\nbe over. She comes into the field, in summer time, when the sun has gone a\r\nthird part of his course. She has the heat of the day to encounter,\r\ninstead of having her work done and being ready to return home at any\r\nearly hour. Yet early she must go, too: for, there is the fire again to\r\nbe made, the clattering tea-tackle again to come forward; and even in the\r\nlongest day she must have _candle light_, which never ought to be seen in\r\na cottage (except in case of illness) from March to September.\r\n\r\n24. Now, then, let us take the bare cost of the use of tea. I suppose a\r\npound of tea to last twenty days; which is not nearly half an ounce every\r\nmorning and evening. I allow for each mess half a pint of milk. And I\r\nallow three pounds of the red dirty sugar to each pound of tea. The\r\naccount of expenditure would then stand very high; but to these must be\r\nadded the amount of the tea tackle, one set of which will, upon an\r\naverage, be demolished every year. To these outgoings must be added the\r\ncost of beer at the public-house; for some the man will have, after all,\r\nand the woman too, unless they be upon the point of actual starvation. Two\r\npots a week is as little as will serve in this way; and here is a dead\r\nloss of ninepence a week, seeing that two pots of beer, full as strong,\r\nand a great deal better, can be brewed at home for threepence. The account\r\nof the year's tea drinking will then stand thus:\r\n\r\n                                  _L._ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  18lb. of tea                     4    10   0\r\n  54lb. of sugar                   1    11   6\r\n  365 pints of milk                1    10   0\r\n  Tea tackle                       0     5   0\r\n  200 fires                        0    16   8\r\n  30 days' work                    0    15   0\r\n  Loss by going to public-house    1    19   0\r\n                                  ------------\r\n                             _L._ 11     7   2[3]\r\n\r\n25. I have here estimated every thing at its very lowest. The\r\nentertainment which I have here provided is as poor, as mean, as miserable\r\nas any thing short of starvation can set forth; and yet the wretched thing\r\namounts to a good third part of a good and able labourer's wages! For this\r\nmoney, he and his family may drink good and wholesome beer; in a short\r\ntime, out of the mere savings from this waste, may drink it out of silver\r\ncups and tankards. In a labourer's family, _wholesome_ beer, that has a\r\nlittle life in it, is all that is wanted in _general_. Little children,\r\nthat do not work, should not have beer. Broth, porridge, or something in\r\nthat way, is the thing for them. However, I shall suppose, in order to\r\nmake my comparison as little complicated as possible, that he brews\r\nnothing but beer as strong as the generality of beer to be had at the\r\npublic-house, and divested of the poisonous drugs which that beer but too\r\noften contains; and I shall further suppose that he uses in his family two\r\nquarts of this beer every day from the first of October to the last day of\r\nMarch inclusive: three quarts a day during the months of April and May;\r\nfour quarts a day during the months of June and September; and five quarts\r\na day during the months of July and August; and if this be not enough, it\r\nmust be a family of drunkards. Here are 1097 quarts, or 274 gallons. Now,\r\na bushel of malt will make eighteen gallons of better beer than that which\r\nis sold at the public-houses. And this is precisely a gallon for the price\r\nof a quart. People should bear in mind, that the beer bought at the\r\npublic-house is loaded with a _beer tax_, with the tax on the public-house\r\nkeeper, in the shape of license, with all the taxes and expenses of the\r\nbrewer, with all the taxes, rent, and other expenses of the publican, and\r\nwith all the _profits_ of both brewer and publican; so that when a man\r\nswallows a pot of beer at a public-house, he has all these expenses to\r\nhelp to defray, besides the mere tax on the malt and on the hops.\r\n\r\n26. Well, then, to brew this ample supply of good beer for a labourer's\r\nfamily, these 274 gallons, requires _fifteen_ bushels of malt and (for let\r\nus do the thing well) _fifteen pounds of hops_. The malt is now eight\r\nshillings a bushel, and very good hops may be bought for less than a\r\nshilling a pound. The _grains_ and yeast will amply pay for the labour and\r\nfuel employed in the brewing; seeing that there will be pigs to eat the\r\ngrains, and bread to be baked with the yeast. The account will then stand\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n                       _L._ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  15 bushels of malt    6    0    0\r\n  15 pounds of hops     0   15    0\r\n  Wear of utensils      0   10    0\r\n                        -----------\r\n                   _L._ 7    5    0[4]\r\n\r\n27. Here, then, is the sum of four pounds two shillings and twopence saved\r\nevery year. The utensils for brewing are, a brass kettle, a mashing tub,\r\ncoolers, (for which washing tubs may serve,) a half hogshead, with one end\r\ntaken out, for a tun tub, about four nine-gallon casks, and a couple of\r\neighteen-gallon casks. This is an ample supply of utensils, each of which\r\nwill last, with proper care, a good long lifetime or two, and the whole of\r\nwhich, even if purchased new from the shop, will only exceed by a few\r\nshillings, if they exceed at all, the amount of the saving, arising _the\r\nvery first year_, from quitting the troublesome and pernicious practice of\r\ndrinking tea. The saving of each succeeding year would, if you chose it,\r\npurchase a silver mug to hold half a pint at least. However, the saving\r\nwould naturally be applied to purposes more conducive to the well-being\r\nand happiness of a family.\r\n\r\n28. It is not, however, the _mere saving_ to which I look. This is,\r\nindeed, a matter of great importance, whether we look at the amount\r\nitself, or at the ultimate consequences of a judicious application of it;\r\nfor _four pounds_ make a great _hole_ in a man's wages for the year; and\r\nwhen we consider all the advantages that would arise to a family of\r\nchildren from having these four pounds, now so miserably wasted, laid out\r\nupon their backs, in the shape of a decent dress, it is impossible to look\r\nat this waste without feelings of sorrow not wholly unmixed with those of\r\na harsher description.\r\n\r\n29. But, I look upon the thing in a still more serious light. I view the\r\ntea drinking as a destroyer of health, an enfeebler of the frame, an\r\nengenderer of effeminacy and laziness, a debaucher of youth, and a maker\r\nof misery for old age. In the fifteen bushels of malt there are 570 pounds\r\nweight of _sweet_; that is to say, of nutricious matter, unmixed with any\r\nthing injurious to health. In the 730 tea messes of the year there are 54\r\npounds of sweet in the sugar, and about 30 pounds of matter equal to sugar\r\nin the milk. Here are 84 pounds instead of 570, and even the good effect\r\nof these 84 pounds is more than over-balanced by the corrosive, gnawing\r\nand poisonous powers of the tea.\r\n\r\n30. It is impossible for any one to deny the truth of this statement. Put\r\nit to the test with a lean hog: give him the fifteen bushels of malt, and\r\nhe will repay you in ten score of bacon or thereabouts. But give him the\r\n730 tea messes, or rather begin to give them to him, and give him nothing\r\nelse, and he is dead with hunger, and bequeaths you his skeleton, at the\r\nend of about seven days. It is impossible to doubt in such a case. The tea\r\ndrinking has done a great deal in bringing this nation into the state of\r\nmisery in which it now is; and the tea drinking, which is carried on by\r\n\"dribs\" and \"drabs;\" by pence and farthings going out at a time; this\r\nmiserable practice has been gradually introduced by the growing weight of\r\nthe taxes on malt and on hops, and by the everlasting penury amongst the\r\nlabourers, occasioned by the paper-money.\r\n\r\n31. We see better prospects however, and therefore let us now rouse\r\nourselves, and shake from us the degrading curse, the effects of which\r\nhave been much more extensive and infinitely more mischievous than men in\r\ngeneral seem to imagine.\r\n\r\n32. It must be evident to every one, that the practice of tea drinking\r\nmust render the frame feeble and unfit to encounter hard labour or severe\r\nweather, while, as I have shown, it deducts from the means of replenishing\r\nthe belly and covering the back. Hence succeeds a softness, an\r\neffeminacy, a seeking for the fire-side, a lurking in the bed, and, in\r\nshort, all the characteristics of idleness, for which, in this case, real\r\nwant of strength furnishes an apology. The tea drinking fills the\r\npublic-house, makes the frequenting of it habitual, corrupts boys as soon\r\nas they are able to move from home, and does little less for the girls, to\r\nwhom the gossip of the tea-table is no bad preparatory school for the\r\nbrothel. At the very least, it teaches them idleness. The everlasting\r\ndawdling about with the slops of the tea tackle, gives them a relish for\r\nnothing that requires strength and activity. When they go from home, they\r\nknow how to do nothing that is useful. To brew, to bake, to make butter,\r\nto milk, to rear poultry; to do any earthly thing of use they are wholly\r\nunqualified. To shut poor young creatures up in manufactories is bad\r\nenough; but there, at any rate, they do something that is useful; whereas,\r\nthe girl that has been brought up merely to boil the tea-kettle, and to\r\nassist in the gossip inseparable from the practice, is a mere consumer of\r\nfood, a pest to her employer, and a curse to her husband, if any man be so\r\nunfortunate as to fix his affections upon her.\r\n\r\n33. But is it in the power of any man, any good labourer, who has attained\r\nthe age of fifty, to look back upon the last thirty years of his life,\r\nwithout cursing the day in which tea was introduced into England? Where is\r\nthere such a man, who cannot trace to this cause a very considerable part\r\nof all the mortifications and sufferings of his life? When was he ever\r\n_too late_ at his labour; when did he ever meet with a frown, with a\r\nturning off, and pauperism on that account, without being able to trace it\r\nto the tea-kettle? When reproached with lagging in the morning, the poor\r\nwretch tells you that he will make up for it by _working during his\r\nbreakfast time_! I have heard this a hundred and a hundred times over. He\r\nwas up time enough; but the tea-kettle kept him lolling and lounging at\r\nhome; and now, instead of sitting down to a breakfast upon bread, bacon,\r\nand beer, which is to carry him on to the hour of dinner, he has to force\r\nhis limbs along under the sweat of feebleness, and at dinner time to\r\nswallow his dry bread, or slake his half-feverish thirst at the pump or\r\nthe brook. To the wretched tea-kettle he has to return at night, with legs\r\nhardly sufficient to maintain him; and thus he makes his miserable\r\nprogress towards that death, which he finds ten or fifteen years sooner\r\nthan he would have found it had he made his wife brew beer instead of\r\nmaking tea. If he now and then gladdens his heart with the drugs of the\r\npublic house, some quarrel, some accident, some illness, is the probable\r\nconsequence; to the affray abroad succeeds an affray at home; the\r\nmischievous example reaches the children, corrupts them or scatters them,\r\nand misery for life is the consequence.\r\n\r\n34. I should now proceed to the _details_ of brewing; but these, though\r\nthey will not occupy a large space, must be put off to the _second\r\nnumber_. The custom of brewing at home has so long ceased amongst\r\nlabourers, and, in many cases, amongst tradesmen, that it was necessary\r\nfor me fully to state my reasons for wishing to see the custom revived. I\r\nshall, in my next, clearly explain how the operation is performed; and it\r\nwill be found to be so _easy a thing_, that I am not without hope, that\r\nmany _tradesmen_, who now spend their evenings at the public house, amidst\r\ntobacco smoke and empty _noise_, may be induced, by the finding of better\r\ndrink at home, at a quarter part of the price, to perceive that home is by\r\nfar the pleasantest place wherein to pass their hours of relaxation.\r\n\r\n35. My work is intended chiefly for the benefit of _cottagers_, who must,\r\nof course, have some _land_; for, I purpose to show, that a large part of\r\nthe food of even a large family may be raised, without any diminution of\r\nthe labourer's earnings abroad, from forty rod, or a quarter of an acre,\r\nof ground; but at the same time, what I have to say will be applicable to\r\nlarger establishments, in all the branches of domestic economy: and\r\nespecially to that of providing a family with _beer_.\r\n\r\n36. The _kind of beer_, for a labourer's family, that is to say, the\r\n_degree of strength_, must depend on circumstances; on the numerousness of\r\nthe family; on the season of the year, and various other things. But,\r\ngenerally speaking, beer _half_ the strength of that mentioned in\r\nparagraph 25 will be quite strong enough; for that is, at least, one-third\r\nstronger than the farm-house \"_small beer_,\" which, however, as long\r\nexperience has proved, is best suited to the purpose. A judicious labourer\r\nwould probably always have some _ale_ in his house, and have small beer\r\nfor the general drink. There is no reason why he should not keep\r\n_Christmas_ as well as the farmer; and when he is _mowing_, _reaping_, or\r\nis at any other hard work, a quart, or three pints, of _really good fat\r\nale_ a-day is by no means too much. However, circumstances vary so much\r\nwith different labourers, that as to the _sort_ of beer, and the number of\r\nbrewings, and the times of brewing, no general rule can be laid down.\r\n\r\n37. Before I proceed to explain the uses of the several brewing utensils,\r\nI must speak of the _quality_ of the materials of which beer is made; that\r\nis to say, the _malt_, _hops_, and _water_. Malt varies very much in\r\nquality, as, indeed, it must, with the quality of the barley. When good,\r\nit is full of flour, and in biting a grain asunder, you find it bite\r\neasily, and see the _shell thin_ and filled up well with flour. If it bite\r\n_hard_ and _steely_, the malt is bad. There is _pale_ malt and _brown_\r\nmalt; but the difference in the two arises merely from the different\r\ndegrees of heat employed in the drying. The main thing to attend to is,\r\nthe _quantity of flour_. If the barley was bad; _thin_, or _steely_,\r\nwhether from unripeness or blight, or any other cause, it will not _malt_\r\nso well; that is to say, it will not send out its roots in due time; and a\r\npart of it will still be barley. Then, the world is wicked enough to\r\nthink, and even to say, that there are maltsters who, when they send you a\r\nbushel of malt, _put a little barley amongst it_, the malt being _taxed_\r\nand the barley _not_! Let us hope that this is seldom the case; yet, when\r\nwe _do know_ that this terrible system of taxation induces the\r\nbeer-selling gentry to supply their customers with stuff little better\r\nthan poison, it is not very uncharitable to suppose it possible for some\r\nmaltsters to yield to the temptations of the devil so far as to play the\r\ntrick above mentioned. To detect this trick, and to discover what portion\r\nof the barley is in an unmalted state, take a handful of the _unground_\r\nmalt, and put it into a bowl of cold water. Mix it about with the water a\r\nlittle; that is, let every grain be _just wet all over_; and whatever part\r\nof them _sink_ are not good. If you have your malt _ground_, there is not,\r\nas I know of, any means of detection. Therefore, if your brewing be\r\nconsiderable in amount, _grind your own malt_, the means of doing which is\r\nvery easy, and neither expensive nor troublesome, as will appear, when I\r\ncome to speak of _flour_. If the barley be _well malted_, there is still a\r\nvariety in the quality of the malt; that is to say, a bushel of malt from\r\nfine, plump, heavy barley, will be better than the same quantity from thin\r\nand light barley. In this case, as in the case of wheat, the _weight_ is\r\nthe criterion of the quality. Only bear in mind, that as a bushel of\r\nwheat, weighing _sixty-two_ pounds, is better worth _six_ shillings, than\r\na bushel weighing _fifty-two_ is worth _four_ shillings, so a bushel of\r\nmalt weighing _forty-five_ pounds is better worth _nine_ shillings, than a\r\nbushel weighing _thirty-five_ is worth _six_ shillings. In malt,\r\ntherefore, as in every thing else, the word _cheap_ is a deception, unless\r\nthe quality be taken into view. But, bear in mind, that in the case of\r\n_unmalted_ barley, mixed with the malt, the _weight_ can be no rule; for\r\nbarley is _heavier_ than malt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nBREWING BEER--(_continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n38. As to using _barley_ in the making of beer, I have given it a full and\r\nfair trial twice over, and I would recommend it to neither rich nor poor.\r\nThe barley produces _strength_, though nothing like the malt; but the\r\nbeer is _flat_, even though you use half malt and half barley; and flat\r\nbeer lies heavy on the stomach, and of course, besides the bad taste, is\r\nunwholesome. To pay 4_s._ 6_d._ tax upon every bushel of our own barley,\r\nturned into malt, when the barley itself is not worth 3_s._ a bushel, is a\r\nhorrid thing; but, as long as the owners of the land shall be so dastardly\r\nas to suffer themselves to be thus deprived of the use of their estates to\r\nfavour the slave-drivers and plunderers of the East and West Indies, we\r\nmust submit to the thing, incomprehensible to foreigners, and even to\r\nourselves, as the submission may be.\r\n\r\n39. With regard to _hops_, the quality is very various. At times when some\r\nsell for 5_s._ a pound, others sell for _sixpence_. Provided the purchaser\r\nunderstand the article, the quality is, of course, in proportion to the\r\nprice. There are two things to be considered in hops: the _power of\r\npreserving beer_, and that of giving it a _pleasant flavour_. Hops may be\r\n_strong_; and yet not _good_. They should be _bright_, have no _leaves_ or\r\nbits of branches amongst them. The hop is the _husk_, or _seed-pod_, of\r\nthe hop-vine, as the _cone_ is that of the fir-tree; and the _seeds_\r\nthemselves are deposited, like those of the fir, round a little soft\r\nstalk, enveloped by the several folds of this pod, or cone. If, in the\r\ngathering, leaves of the vine or bits of the branches are mixed with the\r\nhops, these not only help to make up the _weight_, but they give a _bad\r\ntaste_ to the beer; and indeed, if they abound much, they spoil the beer.\r\nGreat attention is therefore necessary in this respect. There are, too,\r\nnumerous _sorts_ of hops, varying in size, form, and quality, quite as\r\nmuch as _apples_. However, when they are in a state to be used in brewing,\r\nthe marks of goodness are an absence of _brown colour_, (for that\r\nindicates perished hops;) a colour _between green_ and _yellow_; a great\r\n_quantity of the yellow farina_; seeds _not too large nor too hard_; a\r\n_clammy feel_ when rubbed between the fingers; and a _lively_, pleasant\r\nsmell. As to the _age_ of hops, they retain for twenty years, probably,\r\ntheir _power of preserving beer_; but not of giving it a pleasant flavour.\r\nI have used them at _ten years old_, and should have no fear of using\r\nthem at twenty. They lose none of their _bitterness_; none of their power\r\nof preserving beer; but they lose the other quality; and therefore, in the\r\nmaking of fine ale, or beer, new hops are to be preferred. As to the\r\n_quantity_ of hops, it is clear, from what has been said, that that must,\r\nin some degree depend upon their _quality_; but, supposing them to be good\r\nin quality, a pound of hops to a bushel of malt is about the quantity. A\r\ngood deal, however, depends upon the length of time that the beer is\r\nintended to be kept, and upon the season of the year in which it is\r\nbrewed. Beer intended to be kept a long while should have the full pound,\r\nalso beer brewed in warmer weather, though for present use: half the\r\nquantity may do under an opposite state of circumstances.\r\n\r\n40. The _water_ should be soft by all means. That of brooks, or rivers, is\r\nbest. That of a _pond_, fed by a rivulet, or spring, will do very well.\r\n_Rain-water_, if just fallen, may do; but stale rain-water, or stagnant\r\npond-water, makes the beer _flat_ and difficult to keep; and _hard water_,\r\nfrom wells, is very bad; it does not get the sweetness out of the malt,\r\nnor the bitterness out of the hops, like soft water; and the wort of it\r\ndoes not ferment well, which is a certain proof of its unfitness for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n41. There are two descriptions of persons whom I am desirous to see\r\nbrewing their own beer; namely, _tradesmen_, and _labourers_ and\r\n_journeymen_. There must, therefore, be two _distinct scales_ treated of.\r\nIn the former editions of this work, I spoke of a _machine_ for brewing,\r\nand stated the advantages of using it in a family of any considerable\r\nconsumption of beer; but, while, from my desire to promote _private\r\nbrewing_, I strongly recommended the _machine_, I stated that, \"if any of\r\nmy readers could point out any method by which we should be more likely to\r\nrestore the practice of private brewing, and especially to the _cottage_,\r\nI should be greatly obliged to them to communicate it to me.\" Such\r\ncommunications have been made, and I am very happy to be able, in this new\r\nedition of my little work, to avail myself of them. There was, in the\r\n_Patent Machine_, always, an objection on account of the _expense_; for,\r\neven the machine for _one bushel of malt_ cost, at the reduced price,\r\n_eight pounds_; a sum far above the reach of _a cottager_, and even above\r\nthat of a small tradesman. Its _convenience_, especially in _towns_, where\r\nroom is so valuable, was an object of great importance; but there were\r\n_disadvantages_ attending it which, until after some experience, I did not\r\nascertain. It will be remembered that the method by the brewing machine\r\nrequires the malt to be put into _the cold water_, and for the water to\r\nmake the malt _swim_, or, at least, to be in such proportion as to prevent\r\nthe fire beneath from burning the malt. We found that our beer was _flat_,\r\nand that it did _not keep_. And this arose, I have every reason to\r\nbelieve, from this process. The malt should be put _into hot water_, and\r\nthe water, at first, should be but just sufficient in quantity to _stir\r\nthe malt in_, and _separate it well_. Nevertheless, when it is merely to\r\nmake _small beer_; beer _not wanted to keep_; in such cases the brewing\r\nmachine may be of use; and, as will be seen by-and-by, a moveable _boiler_\r\n(which has nothing to do with the _patent_) may, in many cases, be of\r\ngreat convenience and utility.\r\n\r\n42. The two _scales_ of which I have spoken above, are now to be spoken\r\nof; and, that I may explain my meaning the more clearly, I shall suppose,\r\nthat, for the tradesman's family, it will be requisite to brew eighteen\r\ngallons of ale and thirty-six of small beer, to fill three casks of\r\neighteen gallons each. It will be observed, of course, that, for larger\r\nquantities, larger utensils of all sorts will be wanted. I take this\r\nquantity as the one to give directions on. The utensils wanted here will\r\nbe, FIRST, a _copper_ that will contain _forty gallons_, at least; for,\r\nthough there be to be but thirty-six gallons of small beer, there must be\r\nspace for the hops, and for the liquor that goes off in steam. SECOND, a\r\n_mashing-tub_ to contain sixty gallons; for the malt is to be in this\r\nalong with the water. THIRD, an _underbuck_, or shallow tub to go under\r\nthe mash-tub, for the wort to run into when drawn from the grains.\r\nFOURTH, a _tun-tub_, that will contain thirty gallons, to put the ale into\r\nto work, the mash-tub, as we shall see, serving as a tun-tub for the small\r\nbeer. Besides these, a couple of _coolers_, shallow tubs, which may be the\r\nheads of wine buts, or some such things, about a foot deep; or if you have\r\n_four_ it may be as well, in order to effect the cooling more quickly.\r\n\r\n43. You begin by filling the copper with water, and next by making the\r\nwater _boil_. You then put into the mashing-tub water sufficient _to stir\r\nand separate the malt in_. But now let me say more particularly what this\r\nmashing-tub is. It is, you know, to contain _sixty gallons_. It is to be a\r\nlittle broader at top than at bottom, and not quite so deep as it is wide\r\nacross the bottom. Into the middle of the bottom there is a hole about two\r\ninches over, to draw the wort off through. In this hole goes a stick, a\r\nfoot or two longer than the tub is high. This stick is to be about two\r\ninches through, and _tapered_ for about eight inches upwards at the end\r\nthat goes into the hole, which at last it fills up closely as a cork. Upon\r\nthe hole, before any thing else be put into the tub, you lay a little\r\nbundle of _fine birch_, (heath or straw _may_ do,) about half the bulk of\r\na birch broom, and well tied at both ends. This being laid over the hole\r\n(to keep back the grains as the wort goes out,) you put the tapered end of\r\nthe stick down through into the hole, and thus _cork_ the hole up. You\r\nmust then have something of weight sufficient to keep the birch steady at\r\nthe bottom of the tub, with a hole through it to slip down the stick;\r\notherwise when the stick is raised it will be apt to raise the birch with\r\nit, and when you are stirring the mash you would move it from its place.\r\nThe best thing for this purpose will be a _leaden collar_ for the stick,\r\nwith the hole in the collar plenty large enough, and it should weigh three\r\nor four pounds. The thing they use in some farm-houses is the iron box of\r\na wheel. Any thing will do that will slide down the stick, and lie with\r\nweight enough on the birch to keep it from moving. Now, then, you are\r\nready to begin brewing. I allow _two bushels_ of malt for the brewing I\r\nhave supposed. You must now put into the mashing-tub as much boiling water\r\nas will be sufficient to _stir the malt in_ and _separate it well_. But\r\nhere occur some of the nicest points of all; namely, the _degree of heat_\r\nthat the water is to be at, before you put in the malt. This heat is _one\r\nhundred and seventy degrees_ by the thermometer. If you have a\r\nthermometer, this is ascertained easily; but, without one, take this rule,\r\nby which so much good beer has been made in England for hundreds of years:\r\nwhen you can, by looking down into the tub, _see your face clearly in the\r\nwater_, the water is become cool enough; and you must not put the malt in\r\nbefore. Now put in the malt and _stir it well in the water_. To perform\r\nthis stirring, which is very necessary, you have a stick, somewhat bigger\r\nthan a broom-stick, with two or three smaller sticks, eight or ten inches\r\nlong, put through the lower end of it at about three or four inches\r\nasunder, and sticking out on each side of the long stick. These small\r\ncross sticks serve to search the malt and separate it well in the stirring\r\nor _mashing_. Thus, then, the _malt is in_; and in this state it should\r\ncontinue for about a quarter of an hour. In the mean while you will have\r\nfilled up your copper, and made it _boil_; and now (at the end of the\r\nquarter of an hour) you put in boiling water sufficient to give you your\r\neighteen gallons of _ale_. But, perhaps, you must have thirty gallons of\r\nwater in the whole; for the grains will retain at least ten gallons of\r\nwater; and it is better to have rather too much wort than too little. When\r\nyour proper quantity of water is in, stir the malt again well. Cover the\r\nmashing-tub over with _sacks_, or something that will answer the same\r\npurpose; and there let the mash stand for _two hours_. When it has stood\r\nthe two hours, you draw off the wort. And now, mind, the mashing-tub is\r\nplaced on a _couple of stools_, or on something, that will enable you to\r\nput the _underbuck_ under it, so as to receive the wort as it comes out of\r\nthe hole before-mentioned. When you have put the underbuck in its place,\r\nyou let out the wort by pulling up the stick that corks the whole. But,\r\nobserve, this stick (which goes six or eight inches through the hole) must\r\nbe raised by degrees, and the wort must be let out _slowly_, in order to\r\nkeep back the _sediment_. So that it is necessary to have something to\r\n_keep the stick up_ at the point where you are to raise it, and wish to\r\nfix it at for the time. To do this, the simplest, cheapest and best thing\r\nin the world is a _cleft stick_. Take a _rod_ of ash, hazel, birch, or\r\nalmost any wood; let it be a foot or two longer than your mashing-tub is\r\nwide over the top; _split_ it, as if for making hoops; tie it round with a\r\nstring at each end; lay it across your mashing-tub; pull it open in the\r\nmiddle, and let the upper part of the wort-stick through it, and when you\r\nraise that stick, by degrees as before directed, the cleft stick _will\r\nhold it up_ at whatever height you please.\r\n\r\n44. When you have drawn off the _ale-wort_, you proceed to put into the\r\nmashing tub water for the _small beer_. But, I shall go on with my\r\ndirections about the _ale_ till I have got it into the _cask_ and\r\n_cellar_; and shall then return to the small-beer.\r\n\r\n45. As you draw off the ale-wort into the underbuck, you must lade it out\r\nof that into the tun-tub, for which work, as well as for various other\r\npurposes in the brewing, you must have a _bowl-dish_ with a handle to it.\r\nThe underbuck will not hold the whole of the wort. It is, as before\r\ndescribed, a shallow tub, to go _under_ the mashing-tub to draw off the\r\nwort into. Out of this underbuck you must lade the ale-wort into the\r\n_tun-tub_; and there it must remain till your _copper_ be emptied and\r\nready to receive it.\r\n\r\n46. The copper being empty, you put the wort into it, and put in after the\r\nwort, or before it, _a pound and a half of good hops_, well rubbed and\r\nseparated as you put them in. You now make the copper boil, and keep it,\r\nwith the lid off, at a good _brisk_ boil, for a _full hour_, and if it be\r\nan hour and a half it is none the worse.\r\n\r\n47. When the boiling is done, put out your fire, and put the liquor into\r\nthe _coolers_. But it must be put into the coolers _without the hops_.\r\nTherefore, in order to get the hops out of the liquor, you must have a\r\n_strainer_. The best for your purpose is a small _clothes-basket_, or any\r\nother wicker-basket. You set your coolers in the most convenient place. It\r\nmay be in-doors or out of doors, as most convenient. You lay a couple of\r\nsticks across one of the coolers, and put the basket upon them. Put your\r\nliquor, hops and all, into the basket, which will _keep back the hops_.\r\nWhen you have got liquor enough in one cooler, you go to another with your\r\nsticks and basket, till you have got all your liquor out. If you find your\r\nliquor deeper in one cooler than the other, you can make an alteration in\r\nthat respect, till you have the liquor so distributed as to cool equally\r\nfast in both, or all, the coolers.\r\n\r\n48. The next stage of the liquor is in the _tun-tub_, where it is _set to\r\nwork_. Now, a very great point is, the _degree of heat_ that the liquor is\r\nto be at when it is set to working. The proper heat is seventy degrees; so\r\nthat a thermometer makes this matter sure. In the country they determine\r\nthe degree of heat by merely putting a finger into the liquor. Seventy\r\ndegrees is but _just warm_, a gentle _luke-warmth_. Nothing like _heat_. A\r\nlittle experience makes perfectness in such a matter. When at the proper\r\nheat, or nearly, (for the liquor will cool a little in being removed,) put\r\nit into the _tun-tub_. And now, before I speak of the act of setting the\r\nbeer to work, I must describe this _tun-tub_, which I first mentioned in\r\nParagraph 42. It is to hold _thirty gallons_, as you have seen; and\r\nnothing is better than an old _cask_ of that size, or somewhat larger,\r\nwith the head taken out, or cut off. But, indeed, any tub of sufficient\r\ndimensions, and of about the same depth proportioned to the width as a\r\ncask or barrel has, will do for the purpose. Having put the liquor into\r\nthe tun-tub, you put in the _yeast_. About _half a pint_ of good yeast is\r\nsufficient. This should first be put into a thing of some sort that will\r\nhold about a gallon of your liquor; the thing should then be nearly filled\r\nwith liquor, and with a stick or spoon you should mix the yeast well with\r\nthe liquor in this bowl, or other thing, and stir in along with the yeast\r\na handful of _wheat or rye flour_. This mixture is then to be poured out\r\nclean into the tun-tub, and the whole mass of the liquor is then to be\r\nagitated well by lading up and pouring down again with your bowl-dish,\r\ntill the yeast be well mixed with the liquor. Some people do the thing in\r\nanother manner. They mix up the yeast and flour with some liquor (as just\r\nmentioned) taken out of the coolers; and then they set the little vessel\r\nthat contains this mixture down _on the bottom of the tun-tub_; and,\r\nleaving it there, put the liquor out of the coolers into the tun-tub.\r\nBeing placed at the bottom, and having the liquor poured on it, the\r\nmixture is, perhaps, more perfectly effected in this way than in any way.\r\nThe _flour_ may not be necessary; but, as the country people use it, it\r\nis, doubtless, of some use; for their hereditary experience has not been\r\nfor nothing. When your liquor is thus properly put into the tun-tub and\r\nset a working, cover over the top of the tub by laying across it a sack or\r\ntwo, or something that will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n49. We now come to the _last stage_; the _cask_ or _barrel_. But I must\r\nfirst speak of the place for the tun-tub to stand in. The place should be\r\nsuch as to avoid too much warmth or cold. The air should, if possible, be\r\nat about 55 degrees. Any cool place in summer and any _warmish_ place in\r\nwinter. If the weather be _very cold_, some cloths or sacks should be put\r\nround the tun-tub while the beer is working. In about six or eight hours,\r\na _frothy_ head will rise upon the liquor; and it will keep rising, more\r\nor less slowly, for about forty-eight hours. But, the _length of time_\r\nrequired for the working depends on various circumstances; so that no\r\nprecise time can be fixed. The best way is, to take off the froth (which\r\nis indeed _yeast_) at the end of about twenty-four hours, with a common\r\nskimmer, and put it into a pan or vessel of some sort; then, in twelve\r\nhours' time, take it off again in the same way; and so on till the liquor\r\nhas _done working_, and sends up no more yeast. Then it is _beer_; and\r\nwhen it is _quite cold_ (for _ale_ or _strong beer_) put it into the\r\n_cask_ by means of a _funnel_. It must be cold before you do this, or it\r\nwill be what the country-people call _foxed_; that is to say, have a rank\r\nand disagreeable taste. Now, as to the _cask_, it must be _sound_ and\r\n_sweet_. I thought, when writing the former edition of this work, that the\r\n_bell-shaped_ were the best casks. I am now convinced that that was an\r\nerror. The bell-shaped, by contracting the width of the top of the beer,\r\nas that top descends, in consequence of the draft for use, certainly\r\nprevents the _head_ (which always gathers on beer as soon as you begin to\r\ndraw it off) from breaking and mixing in amongst the beer. This is an\r\nadvantage in the bell-shape; but then the bell-shape, which places the\r\nwidest end of the cask uppermost, exposes the cask to the admission of\r\n_external air_ much more than the other shape. This danger approaches from\r\nthe _ends_ of the cask; and, in the bell-shape, you have the _broadest_\r\nend wholly exposed the moment you have drawn out the first gallon of beer,\r\nwhich is not the case with the casks of the common shape. Directions are\r\ngiven, in the case of the bell-casks, to put _damp sand_ on the top to\r\nkeep out the air. But, it is very difficult to make this effectual; and\r\nyet, if you do not keep out the air, your beer will be _flat_; and when\r\nflat, it really is good for nothing but the pigs. It is very difficult to\r\n_fill_ the bell-cask, which you will easily see if you consider its shape.\r\nIt must be placed on the _level_ with the greatest possible _truth_, or\r\nthere will be a space left; and to place it with such truth is, perhaps,\r\nas difficult a thing as a mason or bricklayer ever had to perform. And\r\nyet, if this be not done, there will be an _empty space_ in the cask,\r\nthough it may, at the same time, run over. With the common casks there are\r\nnone of these difficulties. A common eye will see when it is well placed;\r\nand, at any rate, any little vacant space that may be left is not at an\r\n_end_ of the cask, and will, without great carelessness, be so small as to\r\nbe of no consequence. We now come to the act of putting in the beer. The\r\ncask should be placed on a stand with legs about a foot long. The cask,\r\nbeing round, must have a little wedge, or block, on each side to keep it\r\nsteady. _Bricks_ do very well. Bring your beer down into the cellar in\r\nbuckets, and pour it in through the funnel, until the cask be full. The\r\ncask should _lean a little on one side_, when you fill it; because the\r\nbeer will _work again_ here, and send more yeast out of the bung-hole;\r\nand, if the cask were not a little on one side, the yeast would flow over\r\nboth sides of the cask, and would not descend in _one stream_ into a pan,\r\nput underneath to receive it. Here the bell-cask is extremely\r\ninconvenient; for the yeast works up all _over the head_, and _cannot run\r\noff_, and makes a very nasty affair. This _alone_, to say nothing of the\r\nother disadvantages, would decide the question against the bell-casks.\r\nSomething will _go off in this working_, which may continue for two or\r\nthree days. When you put the beer in the cask, you should have a _gallon\r\nor two left_, to keep filling up with as the working produces emptiness.\r\nAt last, when the working is completely over, _right_ the cask. That is to\r\nsay, block it up to its level. Put in a handful of _fresh hops_. Fill the\r\ncask quite full. Put in the bung, with a bit of _coarse linen_ stuff round\r\nit; hammer it down tight; and, if you like, fill a coarse bag with sand,\r\nand lay it, well pressed down, over the bung.\r\n\r\n50. As to the length of time that you are to keep the beer before you\r\nbegin to use it, that must, in some measure, depend on taste. _Such beer_\r\nas this _ale_ will keep almost any length of time. As to the mode of\r\n_tapping_, that is as easy almost as _drinking_. When the cask is _empty_,\r\ngreat care must be taken to cork it _tightly up_, so that no air get in;\r\nfor, if it do, the cask is _moulded_, and when once moulded, it is\r\n_spoiled for ever_. It is never again fit to be used about beer. Before\r\nthe cask be used again, the grounds must be poured out, and the cask\r\ncleaned by several times scalding; by putting in _stones_ (or a _chain_,)\r\nand rolling and shaking about till it be quite clean. Here again the round\r\ncasks have the decided advantage; it being almost impossible to make the\r\nbell-casks thoroughly clean, without _taking the head out_, which is both\r\ntroublesome and expensive; as it cannot be well done by any one but a\r\n_cooper_, who is not always at hand, and who, when he is, must be _paid_.\r\n\r\n51. I have now done with the _ale_, and it remains for me to speak of the\r\n_small beer_. In Paragraph 47 (which now see) I left you drawing off the\r\n_ale-wort_, and with your copper full of boiling water. Thirty-six gallons\r\nof that boiling water are, as soon as you have got your ale-wort out, and\r\nhave put down your mash-tub stick to close up the hole at the bottom; as\r\nsoon as you have done this, thirty-six gallons of the boiling water are to\r\ngo into the mashing-tub; the grains are to be well stirred up, as before;\r\nthe mashing-tub is to be covered over again, as mentioned in Paragraph 43;\r\nand the mash is to stand in that state for _an hour_, and not two hours,\r\nas for the ale-wort.\r\n\r\n52. When the small beer mash has stood its hour, draw it off as in\r\nParagraph 47, and put it into the tun-tub as you did the ale-wort.\r\n\r\n53. By this time your copper will be _empty_ again, by putting your\r\nale-liquor to cool, as mentioned in Paragraph 47. And you now put the\r\nsmall beer wort _into the copper_, with the hops that you used before, and\r\nwith _half a pound of fresh hops_ added to them; and this liquor you boil\r\nbriskly for _an hour_.\r\n\r\n54. By this time you will have taken the grains and the sediment clean out\r\nof the mashing-tub, and taken out the bunch of birch twigs, and made all\r\nclean. Now put in the birch twigs again, and put down your stick as\r\nbefore. Lay your two or three sticks across the mashing-tub, put your\r\nbasket on them, and take your liquor from the copper (putting the fire out\r\nfirst) and pour it into the mashing-tub through the basket. Take the\r\nbasket away, throw the hops to the dunghill, and leave the small beer\r\nliquid _to cool in the mashing-tub_.\r\n\r\n55. Here it is to remain to be _set to working_ as mentioned for the ale,\r\nin Paragraph 48; only, in this case, you will want _more yeast in\r\nproportion_; and should have for your thirty-six gallons of small beer,\r\nthree half pints of good yeast.\r\n\r\n56. Proceed, as to all the rest of the business, as with the ale, only, in\r\nthe case of the small beer, it should be put into the cask, not _quite\r\ncold_, but a _little warm_; or else it will not work at all in the barrel,\r\nwhich it ought to do. It will not work so strongly or so long as the ale;\r\nand may be put in the barrel much sooner; in general the next day after it\r\nis brewed.\r\n\r\n57. All the utensils should be well cleaned and put away as soon as they\r\nare done with; the _little_ things as well as the great things; for it is\r\n_loss of time_ to make new ones. And, now, let us see the _expense_ of\r\nthese utensils. The copper, _new_, 5_l._; the mashing-tub, _new_, 30_s._;\r\nthe tun-tub, not new, 5_s._; the underbuck and three coolers, not new,\r\n20_s._ The whole cost is 7_l._ 10_s._ which is ten shillings less than the\r\n_one bushel machine_. I am now in a farm-house, where the _same set_ of\r\nutensils has been used for _forty years_; and the owner tells me, that,\r\nwith the same use, they may last for _forty years longer_. The machine\r\nwill not, I think, last _four years_, if in any thing like regular use. It\r\nis of sheet-iron, _tinned on the inside_, and this tin _rusts_\r\nexceedingly, and is not to be kept clean without such _rubbing_ as must\r\nsoon take off the tin. The great advantage of the machine is, that it can\r\nbe _removed_. You can brew without a _brew-house_.--You can set the boiler\r\nup against any fire-place, or any window. You can brew under a cart-shed,\r\nand even out of doors. But all this may be done with _these utensils_, if\r\nyour _copper_ be moveable. Make the boiler of _copper_, and not of\r\nsheet-iron, and fix it on a stand with a fire-place and stove-pipe; and\r\nthen you have the whole to brew out of doors with as well as in-doors,\r\nwhich is a very great convenience.\r\n\r\n58. Now with regard to the _other_ scale of brewing, little need be said;\r\nbecause, all the principles being the same, the utensils only are to be\r\nproportioned to the _quantity_. If only one sort of beer be to be brewed\r\nat a time, all the difference is, that, in order to extract the whole of\r\nthe goodness of the malt, the mashing ought to be at _twice_. The two\r\nworts are then put together, and then you boil them together with the\r\nhops.\r\n\r\n59. A Correspondent at _Morpeth_ says, the whole of the utensils used by\r\nhim are a twenty-gallon _pot_, a mashing-tub, that also answers for a\r\ntun-tub, and a shallow tub for a cooler; and that these are plenty for a\r\nperson who is any thing of a contriver. This is very true; and these\r\nthings will cost no more, perhaps, than _forty shillings_. A nine gallon\r\ncask of beer can be brewed very well with such utensils. Indeed, it is\r\nwhat used to be done by almost every labouring man in the kingdom, until\r\nthe high price of malt and comparatively low price of wages rendered the\r\npeople too poor and miserable to be able to brew at all. A Correspondent\r\nat Bristol has obligingly sent me the model of utensils for _brewing on a\r\nsmall scale_; but as they consist chiefly of _brittle ware_, I am of\r\nopinion that they would not so well answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n60. Indeed, as to the country labourers, all they want is the ability to\r\n_get the malt_. Mr. ELLMAN, in his evidence before the Agricultural\r\nCommittee, said, that, when he began farming, forty-five years ago, there\r\nwas not a labourer's family in the parish that did not brew their own beer\r\nand enjoy it by their own fire-sides; and that, _now, not one single\r\nfamily did it, from want of ability to get the malt_. It is the _tax_ that\r\nprevents their getting the malt; for, the barley is cheap enough. The tax\r\ncauses a monopoly in the hands of the maltsters, who, when the tax is\r\n_two_ and _sixpence_, make the malt, cost 7_s._ 6_d._, though the barley\r\ncost but 2_s._ 6_d._; and though the malt, tax and all, ought to cost him\r\nabout 5_s._ 6_d._ If the tax were taken off, this _pernicious monopoly_\r\nwould be destroyed.\r\n\r\n61. The reader will easily see, that, in proportion to the quantity wanted\r\nto be brewed must be the size of the utensils; but, I may observe here,\r\nthat the above utensils are sufficient for three, or even four, bushels of\r\nmalt, if stronger beer be wanted.\r\n\r\n62. When it is necessary, in case of falling short in the quantity wanted\r\nto fill up the ale cask, some may be taken from the small beer. But, upon\r\nthe _whole brewing_, there ought to be no falling short; because, if the\r\ncasks be not _filled up_, the beer will not be good, and certainly will\r\nnot _keep_. Great care should be taken as to the _cleansing_ of the\r\n_casks_. They should be made perfectly _sweet_; or it is impossible to\r\nhave good beer.\r\n\r\n63. The cellar, for beer to keep any length of time, should be cool. Under\r\n_a hill_ is the best place for a cellar; but, at any rate, a cellar of\r\ngood depth, and _dry_. At certain times of the year, beer that is kept\r\nlong will ferment. The vent-pegs must, in such cases, be loosened a\r\nlittle, and afterwards fastened.\r\n\r\n64. Small beer may be tapped almost directly. It is a sort of joke that it\r\nshould _see a Sunday_; but, that it may do before it be two days old. In\r\nshort, any beer is better than water; but it should have some strength and\r\nsome _weeks_ of age at any rate.\r\n\r\n65. I cannot conclude this Essay without expressing my pleasure, that a\r\nlaw has been recently passed to authorize the general retail of beer. This\r\nreally seems necessary to prevent the King's subjects from being\r\n_poisoned_. The brewers and porter quacks have carried their tricks to\r\nsuch an extent, that there is _no safety_ for those who drink brewer's\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\n66. The best and most effectual thing is, however, for people to _brew\r\ntheir own beer_, to enable them and induce them to do which, I have done\r\nall that lies in my power. A longer treatise on the subject would have\r\nbeen of no use. These few plain directions will suffice for those who have\r\na disposition to do the thing, and those who have not would remain unmoved\r\nby any thing that I could say.\r\n\r\n67. There seems to be a _great number of things to do_ in brewing, but the\r\ngreater part of them require only about a _minute_ each. A brewing, such\r\nas I have given the detail of above, may be completed in _a day_; but, by\r\nthe word _day_, I mean to include the _morning_, beginning at four\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\n68. The putting of the beer into barrel is not more than an hour's work\r\nfor a servant woman, or a tradesman's or a farmer's wife. There is no\r\n_heavy_ work, no work too heavy for a woman in any part of the business,\r\notherwise I would not recommend it to be performed by the women, who,\r\nthough so amiable in themselves, are never quite so amiable as when they\r\nare _useful_; and as to beauty, though men may fall in love with girls at\r\n_play_, there is nothing to make them stand to their love like seeing them\r\nat _work_. In conclusion of these remarks on beer brewing, I once more\r\nexpress my most anxious desire to see abolished for ever the accursed tax\r\non _malt_, which, I verily believe, has done more harm to the people of\r\nEngland than was ever done to any people by plague, pestilence, famine,\r\nand civil war.\r\n\r\n69. In Paragraph 76, in Paragraph 108, and perhaps in another place or two\r\n(of the last edition,) I spoke of the _machine_ for brewing. The work\r\nbeing _stereotyped_, it would have been troublesome to alter those\r\nparagraphs; but, of course, the public, in reading them, will bear in mind\r\nwhat has been _now_ said relative to the _machine_. The inventor of that\r\nmachine deserves great praise for his efforts to promote private brewing;\r\nand, as I said before, in certain confined situations, and where the beer\r\nis to be merely _small beer_, and for _immediate use_, and where _time_\r\nand _room_ are of such importance as to make the _cost_ of the machine\r\ncomparatively of trifling consideration, the machine may possibly be found\r\nto be an useful utensil.\r\n\r\n70. Having stated the inducements to the brewing of beer, and given the\r\nplainest directions that I was able to give for the doing of the thing, I\r\nshall, next, proceed to the subject of _bread_. But this subject is too\r\nlarge and of too much moment to be treated with brevity, and must,\r\ntherefore, be put off till my next Number. I cannot, in the mean while,\r\ndismiss the subject of _brewing beer_ without once more adverting to its\r\nmany advantages, as set forth in the foregoing Number of this work.\r\n\r\n71. The following instructions for the making of _porter_, will clearly\r\nshow what sort of stuff is sold at _public-houses_ in London; and we may\r\npretty fairly suppose that the public-house beer in the country is not\r\nsuperior to it in quality, \"A quarter of malt, with these ingredients,\r\nwill make _five barrels of good porter_. Take one quarter of high-coloured\r\nmalt, eight pounds of hops, nine pounds of _treacle_, eight pounds of\r\n_colour_, eight pounds of sliced _liquorice-root_, two drams of _salt of\r\ntartar_, two ounces of _Spanish-liquorice_, and half an ounce of\r\n_capsicum_.\" The author says, that he merely gives the ingredients, as\r\n_used by many persons_.\r\n\r\n72. This extract is taken from a _book on brewing_, recently published in\r\nLondon. What a curious composition! What a mess of drugs! But, if the\r\nbrewers _openly avow_ this, what have we to expect from the _secret\r\npractices_ of them, and the _retailers_ of the article! When we know, that\r\n_beer-doctor_ and _brewers'-druggist_ are professions, practised as openly\r\nas those of _bug-man_ and _rat-killer_, are we simple enough to suppose\r\nthat the above-named are the _only_ drugs that people swallow in those\r\npotions, which they call _pots of beer_? Indeed, we know the contrary; for\r\nscarcely a week passes without witnessing the detection of some greedy\r\nwretch, who has used, in making or in _doctoring_ his beer, drugs,\r\nforbidden by the law. And, it is not many weeks since one of these was\r\nconvicted, in the Court of Excise, for using potent and dangerous drugs,\r\nby the means of which, and a suitable quantity of water, he made _two buts\r\nof beer into three_. Upon this occasion, it appeared that no less than\r\n_ninety_ of these worthies were in the habit of pursuing the same\r\npractices. The drugs are not unpleasant to the taste; they sting the\r\npalate: they give a present relish: they communicate a momentary\r\nexhilaration: but, they give no force to the body, which, on the contrary,\r\nthey enfeeble, and, in many instances, with time, destroy; producing\r\ndiseases from which the drinker would otherwise have been free to the end\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\n73. But, look again at the receipt for making porter. Here are _eight_\r\nbushels of malt to 180 gallons of beer; that is to say, twenty-fire\r\ngallons from the bushel. Now the malt is eight shillings a bushel, and\r\neight pounds of the very _best hops_ will cost but a shilling a pound. The\r\nmalt and hops, then, for the 180 gallons, cost but _seventy-two\r\nshillings_; that is to say, only a little more than _fourpence three\r\nfarthings a gallon_, for stuff which is now retailed for _sixteen pence a\r\ngallon_! If this be not an abomination, I should be glad to know what is.\r\nEven if the treacle, colour, and the drugs, be included, the cost is not\r\n_fivepence a gallon_; and yet, not content with this enormous extortion,\r\nthere are wretches who resort to the use of other and pernicious drugs, in\r\norder to increase their gains!\r\n\r\n74. To provide against this dreadful evil there is, and there can be, no\r\n_law_; for, it is _created by the law_. The _law_ it is that imposes the\r\nenormous tax on the _malt_ and _hops_; the _law_ it is that imposes the\r\n_license tax_, and places the power of granting the license at the\r\ndiscretion of persons appointed by the government; the _law_ it is that\r\nchecks, in this way, the private brewing, and that prevents _free and fair\r\ncompetition_ in the selling of beer, and as long as the _law_ does these,\r\nit will in vain endeavour to prevent the people from being destroyed by\r\nslow poison.\r\n\r\n75. Innumerable are the benefits that would arise from a repeal of the\r\ntaxes on malt and on hops. Tippling-houses might then be shut up with\r\njustice and propriety. The labourer, the artisan, the tradesman, the\r\nlandlord, all would instantly feel the benefit. But the _landlord_ more,\r\nperhaps, in this case, than any other member of the community. The four or\r\nfive pounds a year which the day-labourer now drizzles away in tea-messes,\r\nhe would divide with the farmer, if he had untaxed beer. His wages would\r\n_fall_, and fall to his _advantage_ too. The fall of wages would be not\r\nless than 40_l._ upon a hundred acres. Thus 40_l._ would go, in the end, a\r\nfourth, perhaps to the farmer, and three-fourths to the landlord. This is\r\nthe kind of work to _reduce poor-rates_, and to restore _husbandry to\r\nprosperity_. Undertaken this work _must_ be, and _performed too_; but\r\nwhether we shall see this until the estates have passed away from the\r\n_present race_ of landlords, is a question which must be referred to\r\n_time_.\r\n\r\n76. Surely we may hope, that, when the American farmers shall see this\r\nlittle Essay, they will begin seriously to think of leaving off the use of\r\nthe liver-burning and palsy-producing _spirits_. Their _climate_, indeed,\r\nis something: _extremely hot_ in one part of the year, and _extremely\r\ncold_ in the other part of it. Nevertheless, they may have, and do have,\r\nvery good beer if they will. _Negligence_ is the greatest impediment in\r\ntheir way. I like the Americans very much; and that, if there were no\r\nother, would be a reason for my not hiding their faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\nMAKING BREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n77. Little time need be spent in dwelling on the necessity of _this_\r\narticle to all families; though, on account of the modern custom of using\r\n_potatoes_ to supply the place of _bread_, it seems necessary to say a few\r\nwords here on the subject, which, in another work I have so amply, and, I\r\nthink, so triumphantly discussed. I am the more disposed to revive the\r\nsubject for a moment, in this place, from having read, in the evidence\r\nrecently given before the Agricultural Committee, that many labourers,\r\nespecially in the West of England, use potatoes _instead_ of bread to a\r\nvery great extent. And I find, from the same evidence, that it is the\r\ncustom to allot to labourers \"_a potatoe ground_\" in part payment of their\r\nwages! This has a tendency to bring English labourers down to the state of\r\nthe Irish, whose mode of living, as to food, is but one remove from that\r\nof the pig, and of the ill-fed pig too.\r\n\r\n78. I was, in reading the above-mentioned Evidence, glad to find, that\r\nMr. EDWARD WAKEFIELD, the best informed and most candid of all the\r\nwitnesses, gave it as his opinion, that the increase which had taken place\r\nin the cultivation of potatoes was \"_injurious to the country_;\" an\r\nopinion which must, I think, be adopted by every one who takes the trouble\r\nto reflect a little upon the subject. For leaving out of the question the\r\nslovenly and beastly habits engendered amongst the labouring classes by\r\nconstantly lifting their principal food at once out of the earth to their\r\nmouths, by eating without the necessity of any implements other than the\r\nhands and the teeth, and by dispensing with everything requiring skill in\r\nthe preparation of the food, and requiring cleanliness in its consumption\r\nor preservation; leaving these out of the question, though they are all\r\nmatters of great moment, when we consider their effects in the rearing of\r\na family, we shall find, that, in mere quantity of food, that is to say of\r\n_nourishment_, bread is the preferable diet.\r\n\r\n79. An acre of land that will produce 300 bushels of potatoes, will\r\nproduce 32 bushels of wheat. I state this as an average fact, and am not\r\nat all afraid of being contradicted by any one well acquainted with\r\nhusbandry. The potatoes are supposed to be of a _good sort_, as it is\r\ncalled, and the wheat may be supposed to weigh 60 pounds a bushel. It is a\r\nfact clearly established, that, after the _water_, the _stringy_\r\nsubstance, and the _earth_, are taken from the potatoe, there remains only\r\none _tenth_ of the rough raw weight of nutritious matter, or matter which\r\nis deemed equally nutritious with bread, and, as the raw potatoes weigh\r\n56lb. a bushel, the acre will yield 1,830lb. of nutritious matter. Now\r\nmind, a bushel of wheat, weighing 60lb. will make of _household bread_\r\n(that is to say, taking out only the _bran_) 65lb. Thus, the acre yields\r\n2,080lb. of bread. As to the _expenses_, the seed and act of planting are\r\nabout equal in the two cases. But, while the potatoes _must_ have\r\ncultivation during their growth, the wheat needs none; and while the wheat\r\nstraw is worth from three to five pounds an acre, the haulm of the\r\npotatoes is not worth one single truss of that straw. Then, as to the\r\nexpense of gathering, housing, and keeping the potatoe crop, it is\r\nenormous, besides the risk of loss by frost, which may be safely taken, on\r\nan average, at a tenth of the crop. Then comes the expense of _cooking_.\r\nThe thirty-two bushels of wheat, supposing a bushel to be baked at a time,\r\n(which would be the case in a large family,) would demand _thirty-two\r\nheatings of the oven_. Suppose a bushel of potatoes to be cooked every day\r\nin order to supply the place of this bread, then we have _nine hundred\r\nboilings of the pot_, unless _cold potatoes_ be eaten at some of the\r\nmeals; and, in that case, the diet must be _cheering_ indeed! Think of the\r\n_labour_; think of the _time_; think of all the peelings and scrapings and\r\nwashings and messings attending these _nine hundred boilings of the pot_!\r\nFor it must be a considerable time before English people can be brought to\r\neat potatoes in the Irish style; that is to say, scratch them out of the\r\nearth with their paws, toss them into a pot without washing, and when\r\nboiled, turn them out upon a dirty board, and then sit round that board,\r\npeel the skin and dirt from one at a time and eat the inside. Mr. Curwen\r\nwas delighted with \"_Irish hospitality_,\" because the people there receive\r\nno parish relief; upon which I can only say, that I wish him the exclusive\r\nbenefit of such hospitality.\r\n\r\n80. I have here spoken of a large quantity of each of the sorts of food. I\r\nwill now come to a comparative view, more immediately applicable to a\r\nlabourer's family. When wheat is _ten_ shillings the bushel, potatoes,\r\nbought at best hand, (I am speaking of the country generally,) are about\r\n_two_ shillings (English) a bushel. Last spring the average price of wheat\r\nmight be _six and sixpence_, (English;) and the average price of potatoes\r\n(in small quantities) was about _eighteen-pence_; though, by the\r\nwagon-load, I saw potatoes bought at a _shilling_ (English) a bushel, to\r\ngive to sheep; then, observe, these were of the coarsest kind, and the\r\nfarmer had to fetch them at a considerable expense. I think, therefore,\r\nthat I give the advantage to the potatoes when I say that they sell, upon\r\nan average, for full a _fifth_ part as much as the wheat sells for, per\r\nbushel, while they contain four pounds less weight than the bushel of\r\nwheat; while they yield only five pounds and a half of nutritious matter\r\nequal to bread; and while the bushel of wheat will yield _sixty-five\r\npounds of bread_, besides the ten pounds of bran. Hence it is clear, that,\r\ninstead of that _saving_, which is everlastingly dinned in our ears, from\r\nthe use of potatoes, there is a _waste of more than one half_; seeing\r\nthat, when wheat is _ten shillings_ (English) the bushel, you can have\r\n_sixty-five pounds of bread for the ten shillings_; and can have out of\r\npotatoes only five pounds and a half of nutritious matter equal to bread\r\nfor _two shillings_! (English.) This being the case, I trust that we shall\r\nsoon hear no more of those _savings_ which the labourer makes by the use\r\nof potatoes; I hope we shall, in the words of Dr. DRENNAN, \"leave Ireland\r\nto her _lazy_ root,\" if she choose still to adhere to it. It is the root,\r\nalso, of slovenliness, filth, misery, and slavery; its cultivation has\r\nincreased in England with the increase of the paupers: both, I thank God,\r\nare upon the decline. Englishmen seem to be upon the return to beer and\r\nbread, from water and potatoes: and, therefore, I shall now proceed to\r\noffer some observations to the cottager, calculated to induce him to bake\r\nhis own bread.\r\n\r\n81. As I have before stated, sixty pounds of wheat, that is to say, where\r\nthe Winchester bushel weighs sixty pounds, will make sixty-five pounds of\r\nbread, besides the leaving of about ten pounds of bran. This is household\r\nbread, made of flour from which the bran only is taken. If you make fine\r\nflour, you take out pollard, as they call it, as well as bran, and then\r\nyou have a smaller quantity of bread and a greater quantity of offal; but,\r\neven of this finer bread, bread equal in fineness to the baker's bread,\r\nyou get from _fifty-eight to fifty-nine_ pounds out of the bushel of\r\nwheat. Now, then, let us see how many quartern loaves you get out of the\r\nbushel of wheat, supposing it to be fine flour, in the first place. You\r\nget thirteen quartern loaves and a half; these cost you, at the present\r\naverage price of wheat (seven and sixpence a bushel,) in the first place\r\n7_s_. 6_d._;[5] then 3_d._ for yeast; then not more than 3_d._ for\r\ngrinding; because you have about thirteen pounds of offal, which is worth\r\nmore than a 1/2_d._ a pound, while the grinding is 9_d._ a bushel. Thus,\r\nthen, the bushel of bread of fifty-nine pounds costs you _eight\r\nshillings_; and it yields you the weight of thirteen and a half quartern\r\nloaves: these quartern loaves _now_ (Dec. 1821) sell at Kensington, at the\r\nbaker's shop, at 1_s._ 1/2_d._; that is to say, the thirteen quartern\r\nloaves and a half cost 14_s._ 7-1/2_d._ I omitted to mention the salt,\r\nwhich would cost you 4_d._ more. So that, here is 6_s._ 3-1/2_d._ saved\r\nupon the baking of a bushel of bread. The baker's quartern loaf is indeed\r\ncheaper in the country than at Kensington, by, probably, a penny in the\r\nloaf; which would still, however, leave a saving of 5_s._ upon the bushel\r\nof bread. But, besides this, pray think a little of the materials of which\r\nthe baker's loaf is composed. The _alum_, the _ground potatoes_, and other\r\nmaterials; it being a notorious fact, that the bakers, in London at least,\r\nhave _mills_ wherein to grind their potatoes; so large is the scale upon\r\nwhich they use that material. It is probable, that, out of a bushel of\r\nwheat, they make between _sixty_ and _seventy_ pounds of bread, though\r\nthey have no more _flour_, and, of course, no more nutritious matter, than\r\nyou have in your fifty-nine pounds of bread. But, at the least, supposing\r\ntheir bread to be as good as yours in quality, you have, allowing a\r\nshilling for the heating of the oven, a clear 4_s._ saved upon every\r\nbushel of bread. If you consume half a bushel a week, that is to say about\r\na quartern loaf a day, this is a saving of 5_l._ 4_s._ a year, or full a\r\nsixth part, if not a fifth part, of the earnings of a labourer in\r\nhusbandry.\r\n\r\n82. How wasteful, then, and, indeed, how shameful, for a labourer's wife\r\nto go to the baker's shop; and how negligent, how criminally careless of\r\nthe welfare of his family, must the labourer be, who permits so scandalous\r\na use of the proceeds of his labour! But I have hitherto taken a view of\r\nthe matter the least possibly advantageous to the home-baked bread. For,\r\nninety-nine times out of a hundred, the fuel for heating the oven costs\r\nvery little. The hedgers, the copsers, the woodmen of all descriptions,\r\nhave fuel for little or nothing. At any rate, to heat the oven cannot,\r\nupon an average, take the country through, cost the labourer more than\r\n6_d._ a bushel. Then, again, fine flour need not ever be used, and ought\r\nnot to be used. This adds six pounds of bread to the bushel, or nearly\r\nanother quartern loaf and a half, making nearly fifteen quartern loaves\r\nout of the bushel of wheat. The finest flour is by no means the most\r\nwholesome; and, at any rate, there is more nutritious matter in a pound of\r\nhousehold bread than in a pound of baker's bread. Besides this, rye, and\r\neven barley, especially when mixed with wheat, make very good bread. Few\r\npeople upon the face of the earth live better than the Long Islanders. Yet\r\nnine families out of ten seldom eat wheaten-bread. Rye is the flour that\r\nthey principally make use of. Now, rye is seldom more than two-thirds the\r\nprice of wheat, and barley is seldom more than half the price of wheat.\r\nHalf rye and half wheat, taking out a little more of the offal, make very\r\ngood bread. Half wheat, a quarter rye and a quarter barley, nay, one-third\r\nof each, make bread that I could be very well content to live upon all my\r\nlifetime; and, even barley alone, if the barley be good, and none but the\r\nfinest flour taken out of it, has in it, measure for measure, ten times\r\nthe nutrition of potatoes. Indeed the fact is well known, that our\r\nforefathers used barley bread to a very great extent. Its only fault, with\r\nthose who dislike it, is its sweetness, a fault which we certainly have\r\nnot to find with the baker's loaf, which has in it little more of the\r\n_sweetness_ of grain than is to be found in the offal which comes from\r\nthe sawings of deal boards. The nutritious nature of barley is amply\r\nproved by the effect, and very rapid effect, of its meal, in the fatting\r\nof hogs and of poultry of all descriptions. They will fatten quicker upon\r\nmeal of barley than upon any other thing. The flesh, too, is sweeter than\r\nthat proceeding from any other food, with the exception of that which\r\nproceeds from _buck wheat_, a grain little used in England. That\r\nproceeding from Indian corn is, indeed, still sweeter and finer; but this\r\nis wholly out of the question with us.\r\n\r\n83. I am, by-and-by, to speak of the _cow_ to be kept by the labourer in\r\nhusbandry. Then there will be _milk_ to wet the bread with, an exceedingly\r\ngreat improvement in its taste as well as in its quality! This, of all the\r\nways of using skim milk, is the most advantageous: and this great\r\nadvantage must be wholly thrown away, if the bread of the family be bought\r\nat the shop. With milk, bread with very little wheat in it may be made far\r\nbetter than baker's bread; and, leaving the milk out of the question,\r\ntaking a third of each sort of grain, you would get bread weighing as much\r\nas fourteen quartern loaves, for about 5_s._ 9_d._ at present prices of\r\ngrain; that is to say, you would get it for about 5_d._ the quartern loaf,\r\nall expenses included; thus you have nine pounds and ten ounces of bread a\r\nday for about 5_s._ 9_d._ a week. Here is enough for a very large family.\r\nVery few labourers' families can want so much as this, unless indeed there\r\nbe several persons in it capable of earning something by their daily\r\nlabour. Here is cut and come again. Here is bread always for the table.\r\nBread to carry a field; always a hunch of bread ready to put into the hand\r\nof a hungry child. We hear a great deal about \"_children crying for\r\nbread_,\" and objects of compassion they and their parents are, when the\r\nlatter have not the means of obtaining a sufficiency of bread. But I\r\nshould be glad to be informed, how it is possible for a labouring man, who\r\nearns, upon an average, 10_s._ a week, who has not more than four\r\nchildren (and if he have more, some ought to be doing something;) who has\r\na garden of a quarter of an acre of land (for that makes part of my plan;)\r\nwho has a wife as industrious as she ought to be; who does not waste his\r\nearnings at the ale-house or the tea shop: I should be glad to know how\r\nsuch a man, while wheat shall be at the price of about 6_s._ a bushel,\r\n_can possibly have children crying for bread_!\r\n\r\n84. Cry, indeed, they must, if he will persist in giving 13_s._ for a\r\nbushel of bread instead of 5_s._ 9_d._ Such a man is not to say that the\r\nbread which I have described is _not good enough_. It was good enough for\r\nhis forefathers, who were too proud to be paupers, that is to say, abject\r\nand willing slaves. \"Hogs eat barley.\" And hogs will eat wheat, too, when\r\nthey can get at it. Convicts in condemned cells eat wheaten bread; but we\r\nthink it no degradation to eat wheaten bread, too. I am for depriving the\r\nlabourer of none of his rights; I would have him oppressed in no manner or\r\nshape; I would have him bold and free; but to have him such, he must have\r\nbread in his house, sufficient for all his family, and whether that bread\r\nbe fine or coarse must depend upon the different circumstances which\r\npresent themselves in the cases of different individuals.\r\n\r\n85. The married man has no right to expect the same plenty of food and of\r\nraiment that the single man has. The time before marriage is the time to\r\nlay by, or, if the party choose, to indulge himself in the absence of\r\nlabour. To marry is a voluntary act, and it is attended in the result with\r\ngreat pleasures and advantages. If, therefore, the laws be fair and equal;\r\nif the state of things be such that a labouring man can, with the usual\r\nability of labourers, and with constant industry, care and sobriety; with\r\ndecency of deportment towards all his neighbours, cheerful obedience to\r\nhis employer, and a due subordination to the laws; if the state of things\r\nbe such, that such a man's earnings be sufficient to maintain himself and\r\nfamily with food, raiment, and lodging needful for them; such a man has\r\nno reason to complain; and no labouring man has reason to complain, if the\r\nnumerousness of his family should call upon him for extraordinary\r\nexertion, or for frugality uncommonly rigid. The man with a large family\r\nhas, if it be not in a great measure his own fault, a greater number of\r\npleasures and of blessings than other men. If he be wise, and _just_ as\r\nwell as wise, he will see that it is reasonable for him to expect less\r\ndelicate fare than his neighbours, who have a less number of children, or\r\nno children at all. He will see the justice as well as the necessity of\r\nhis resorting to the use of coarser bread, and thus endeavour to make up\r\nthat, or at least a part of that, which he loses in comparison with his\r\nneighbours. The quality of the bread ought, in every case, to be\r\nproportioned to the number of the family and the means of the head of that\r\nfamily. Here is no injury to health proposed; but, on the contrary, the\r\nbest security for its preservation. Without bread, all is misery. The\r\nScripture truly calls it the staff of life; and it may be called, too, the\r\npledge of peace and happiness in the labourer's dwelling.\r\n\r\n86. As to the act of making bread, it would be shocking indeed if that had\r\nto be taught by the means of books. Every woman, high or low, ought to\r\nknow how to make bread. If she do not, she is unworthy of trust and\r\nconfidence; and, indeed, a mere burden upon the community. Yet, it is but\r\ntoo true, that many women, even amongst those who have to get their living\r\nby their labour, know nothing of the making of bread; and seem to\r\nunderstand little more about it than the part which belongs to its\r\nconsumption. A Frenchman, a Mr. CUSAR, who had been born in the West\r\nIndies, told me, that till he came to Long Island, he never knew _how the\r\nflour came_: that he was surprised when he learnt that it was squeezed out\r\nof little grains that grew at the tops of straw; for that he had always\r\nhad an idea that it was got out of some large substances, like the yams\r\nthat grow in tropical climates. He was a very sincere and good man, and I\r\nam sure he told me truth. And this may be the more readily believed, when\r\nwe see so many women in England, who seem to know no more of the\r\nconstituent parts of a loaf than they know of those of the moon. Servant\r\nwomen in abundance appear to think that loaves are made by the baker, as\r\nknights are made by the king; things of their pure creation, a creation,\r\ntoo, in which no one else can participate. Now, is not this an enormous\r\nevil? And whence does it come? Servant women are the children of the\r\nlabouring classes; and they would all know how to make bread, and know\r\nwell how to make it too, if they had been fed on bread of their mother's\r\nand their own making.\r\n\r\n87. How serious a matter, then, is this, even in this point of view! A\r\nservant that cannot make bread is not entitled to the same wages as one\r\nthat can. If she can neither bake nor brew; if she be ignorant of the\r\nnature of flour, yeast, malt, and hops, what is she good for? If she\r\nunderstand these matters well; if she be able to supply her employer with\r\nbread and with beer, she is really _valuable_; she is entitled to good\r\nwages, and to consideration and respect into the bargain; but if she be\r\nwholly deficient in these particulars, and can merely dawdle about with a\r\nbucket and a broom, she can be of very little consequence; to lose her, is\r\nmerely to lose a consumer of food, and she can expect very little indeed\r\nin the way of desire to make her life easy and pleasant. Why should any\r\none have such desire? She is not a child of the family. She is not a\r\nrelation. Any one as well as she can take in a loaf from the baker, or a\r\nbarrel of beer from the brewer. She has nothing whereby to bind her\r\nemployer to her. To sweep a room any thing is capable of that has got two\r\nhands. In short, she has no useful skill, no useful ability; she is an\r\nordinary drudge, and she is treated accordingly.\r\n\r\n88. But, if such be her state in the house of an employer, what is her\r\nstate in the house of a _husband_? The lover is blind; but the husband has\r\neyes to see with. He soon discovers that there is something wanted\r\nbesides dimples and cherry cheeks; and I would have fathers seriously\r\nreflect, and to be well assured, that the way to make their daughters to\r\nbe long admired, beloved and respected by their husbands, is to make them\r\nskilful, able and active in the most necessary concerns of a family.\r\nEating and drinking come three times every day; the preparations for\r\nthese, and all the ministry necessary to them, belong to the wife; and I\r\nhold it to be impossible, that at the end of two years, a really ignorant,\r\nsluttish wife should possess any thing worthy of the name of love from her\r\nhusband. This, therefore, is a matter of far greater moment to the father\r\nof a family, than, whether the Parson of the parish, or the Methodist\r\nPriest, be the most \"_Evangelical_\" of the two; for it is here a question\r\nof the daughter's happiness or misery for life. And I have no hesitation\r\nto say, that if I were a labouring man, I should prefer teaching my\r\ndaughters to bake, brew, milk, make butter and cheese, to teaching them to\r\nread the Bible till they had got every word of it by heart; and I should\r\nthink, too, nay I should know, that I was in the former case doing my duty\r\ntowards God as well as towards my children.\r\n\r\n89. When we see a family of dirty, ragged little creatures, let us inquire\r\ninto the cause; and ninety-nine times out of every hundred we shall find\r\nthat the parents themselves have been brought up in the same way. But a\r\nconsideration which ought of itself to be sufficient, is the contempt in\r\nwhich a husband will naturally hold a wife that is ignorant of the matters\r\nnecessary to the conducting of a family. A woman who understands all the\r\nthings above mentioned, is really a skilful person; a person worthy of\r\nrespect, and that will be treated with respect too, by all but brutish\r\nemployers or brutish husbands; and such, though sometimes, are not very\r\nfrequently found. Besides, if natural justice and our own interest had not\r\nthe weight which they have, such valuable persons will be treated with\r\nrespect. They know their own worth; and, accordingly, they are more\r\ncareful of their character, more careful not to lessen by misconduct the\r\nvalue which they possess from their skill and ability.\r\n\r\n90. Thus, then, the interest of the labourer; his health; the health of\r\nhis family; the peace and happiness of his home; the prospects of his\r\nchildren through life; their skill, their ability, their habits of\r\ncleanliness, and even their moral deportment; all combine to press upon\r\nhim the adoption and the constant practice of this branch of domestic\r\neconomy. \"Can she _bake_?\" is the question that I always put. If she can,\r\nshe is _worth a pound or two a year more_. Is that nothing? Is it nothing\r\nfor a labouring man to make his four or five daughters worth eight or ten\r\npounds a year more; and that too while he is by the same means providing\r\nthe more plentifully for himself and the rest of his family? The reasons\r\non the side of the thing that I contend for are endless; but if this one\r\nmotive be not sufficient, I am sure, all that I have said, and all that I\r\ncould say, must be wholly unavailing.\r\n\r\n91. Before, however, I dismiss this subject, let me say a word or two to\r\nthose persons who do not come under the denomination of labourers. In\r\nLondon, or in any very large town where the space is so confined, and\r\nwhere the proper fuel is not handily to be come at and stored for use, to\r\nbake your own bread may be attended with too much difficulty; but in all\r\nother situations there appears to me to be hardly any excuse for not\r\nbaking bread at home. If the family consist of twelve or fourteen persons,\r\nthe money actually saved in this way (even at present prices) would be\r\nlittle short of from twenty to thirty pounds a year. At the utmost here is\r\nonly the time of one woman occupied one day in the week. Now mind, here\r\nare twenty-five pounds to be employed in some way different from that of\r\ngiving it to the baker. If you add five of these pounds to a woman's\r\nwages, is not that full as well employed as giving it in wages to the\r\nbaker's men? Is it not better employed for you? and is it not better\r\nemployed for the community? It is very certain, that if the practice were\r\nas prevalent as I could wish, there would be a large deduction from the\r\nregular baking population; but would there be any harm if less alum were\r\nimported into England, and if some of those youths were left at the\r\nplough, who are now bound in apprenticeships to learn the art and mystery\r\nof doing that which every girl in the kingdom ought to be taught to do by\r\nher mother? It ought to be a maxim with every master and every mistress,\r\nnever to employ another to do that which can be done as well by their own\r\nservants. The more of their money that is retained in the hands of their\r\nown people, the better it is for them altogether. Besides, a man of a\r\nright mind must be pleased with the reflection, that there is a great mass\r\nof skill and ability under his own roof. He feels stronger and more\r\nindependent on this account, all pecuniary advantage out of the question.\r\nIt is impossible to conceive any thing more contemptible than a crowd of\r\nmen and women living together in a house, and constantly looking out of it\r\nfor people to bring them food and drink, and to fetch their garments to\r\nand fro. Such a crowd resemble a nest of unfledged birds, absolutely\r\ndependent for their very existence on the activity and success of the old\r\nones.\r\n\r\n92. Yet, on men go, from year to year, in this state of wretched\r\ndependence, even when they have all the means of living within themselves,\r\nwhich is certainly the happiest state of life that any one can enjoy. It\r\nmay be asked, Where is the mill to be found? where is the wheat to be got?\r\nThe answer is, Where is there not a mill? where is there not a market?\r\nThey are every where, and the difficulty is to discover what can be the\r\nparticular attractions contained in that long and luminous manuscript, a\r\nbaker's half-yearly bill.\r\n\r\n93. With regard to the mill, in speaking of families of any considerable\r\nnumber of persons, the mill has, with me, been more than once a subject of\r\nobservation in print. I for a good while experienced the great\r\ninconvenience and expense of sending my wheat and other grain to be ground\r\nat a mill. This expense, in case of a considerable family, living at only\r\na mile from a mill, is something; but the inconveniency and uncertainty\r\nare great. In my \"Year's Residence in America,\" from Paragraphs 1031 and\r\nonwards, I give an account of a horse-mill which I had in my farm yard;\r\nand I showed, I think very clearly, that corn could be ground cheaper in\r\nthis way than by wind or water, and that it would answer well to grind for\r\nsale in this way as well as for home use. Since my return to England I\r\nhave seen a mill, erected in consequence of what the owner had read in my\r\nbook. This mill belongs to a small farmer, who, when he cannot work on his\r\nland with his horses, or in the season when he has little for them to do,\r\ngrinds wheat, sells the flour; and he takes in grists to grind, as other\r\nmillers do. This mill goes with three small horses; but what I would\r\nrecommend to gentlemen with considerable families, or to farmers, is a\r\nmill such as I myself have at present.\r\n\r\n94. With this mill, turned by a man and a stout boy, I can grind six\r\nbushels of wheat in a day and dress the flour. The grinding of six bushels\r\nof wheat at ninepence a bushel comes to four and sixpence, which pays the\r\nman and the boy, supposing them (which is not and seldom can be the case)\r\nto be hired for the express purpose out of the street. With the same mill\r\nyou grind meat for your pigs; and of this you will get eight or ten\r\nbushels ground in a day. You have no trouble about sending to the mill;\r\nyou are sure to have your _own wheat_; for strange as it may seem, I used\r\nsometimes to find that I sent white Essex wheat to the mill, and that it\r\nbrought me flour from very coarse red wheat. There is no accounting for\r\nthis, except by supposing that wind and water power has something in it to\r\nchange the very nature of the grain; as, when I came to grind by horses,\r\nsuch as the wheat went into the hopper, so the flour came out into the\r\nbin.\r\n\r\n95. But mine now is only on the petty scale of providing for a dozen of\r\npersons and a small lot of pigs. For a farm-house, or a gentleman's house\r\nin the country, where there would be _room_ to have a walk for a horse,\r\nyou might take the labour from the men, clap any little horse, pony, or\r\neven ass to the wheel; and he would grind you off eight or ten bushels of\r\nwheat in a day, and both he and you would have the thanks of your men into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\n96. The cost of this mill is twenty pounds. The dresser is four more; the\r\nhorse-path and wheel might, possibly, be four or five more; and, I am very\r\ncertain, that to any farmer living at a mile from a mill, (and that is\r\nless than the average distance perhaps;) having twelve persons in family,\r\nhaving forty pigs to feed, and twenty hogs to fatten, the savings of such\r\na mill would pay the whole expenses of it the very first year. Such a\r\nfarmer cannot send less than _fifty times_ a year to the mill. Think of\r\nthat, in the first place! The elements are not always propitious:\r\nsometimes the water fails, and sometimes the wind. Many a farmer's wife\r\nhas been tempted to vent her spleen on both. At best, there must be horse\r\nand man, or boy, and, perhaps, cart, to go to the mill; and that, too,\r\nobserve, in all weathers, and in the harvest as well as at other times of\r\nthe year. The case is one of imperious necessity: neither floods nor\r\ndroughts, nor storms nor calms, will allay the cravings of the kitchen,\r\nnor quiet the clamorous uproar of the stye. Go, somebody must, to some\r\nplace or other, and back they must come with flour and with meal. One\r\nsummer many persons came down the country more than fifty miles to a mill\r\nthat I knew in Pennsylvania; and I have known farmers in England carry\r\ntheir grists more than fifteen miles to be ground. It is surprising, that,\r\nunder these circumstances, hand-mills and horse-mills should not, long\r\nago, have become of more general use; especially when one considers that\r\nthe labour, in this case, would cost the farmer next to nothing. To grind\r\nwould be the work of a wet day. There is no farmer who does not at least\r\nfifty days in every year exclaim, when he gets up in the morning, \"What\r\nshall I set _them_ at to-day?\" If he had a mill, he would make them pull\r\noff their shoes, sweep all out clean, winnow up some corn, if he had it\r\nnot already done, and grind and dress, and have every thing in order. No\r\nscolding within doors about the grist; no squeaking in the stye; no boy\r\nsent off in the rain to the mill.\r\n\r\n97. But there is one advantage which I have not yet mentioned; and which\r\nis the greatest of all; namely, that you would have the power of supplying\r\nyour married labourers; your blacksmith's men sometimes; your\r\nwheelwright's men at other times; and, indeed, the greater part of the\r\npersons that you employed, with good flour, instead of their going to\r\npurchase their flour, after it had passed through the hands of a Corn\r\nMerchant, a Miller, a Flour Merchant, and a Huckster, every one of whom\r\ndoes and must have a profit out of the flour, arising from wheat grown\r\nupon, and sent away from, your very farm! I used to let all my people have\r\nflour at the same price that they would otherwise have been compelled to\r\ngive for worse flour. _Every Farmer_ will understand me when I say, that\r\nhe ought to pay for nothing in _money_, which he can pay for in any thing\r\nbut money. His maxim is to keep the money that he takes as long as he can.\r\nNow here is a most effectual way of putting that maxim in practice to a\r\nvery great extent. Farmers know well that it is the Saturday night which\r\nempties their pockets; and here is the means of cutting off a good half of\r\nthe Saturday night. The men have better flour for the same money, and\r\nstill the farmer keeps at home those profits which would go to the\r\nmaintaining of the dealers in wheat and in flour.\r\n\r\n98. The maker of my little mill is Mr. HILL, of Oxford-street. The expense\r\nis what I have stated it to be. I, with my small establishment, find the\r\nthing convenient and advantageous; what then must it be to a gentleman in\r\nthe country who has room and horses, and a considerable family to provide\r\nfor? The dresser is so contrived as to give you at once, meal, of four\r\ndegrees of fineness; so that, for certain purposes, you may take the very\r\nfinest; and, indeed, you may have your flour, and your bread of course, of\r\nwhat degree of fineness you please. But there is also a _steel mill_, much\r\nless _expensive_, requiring _less labour_, and yet quite sufficient for a\r\n_family_. Mills of this sort, very good, and at a reasonable price, are to\r\nbe had of Mr. PARKES, in _Fenchurch-street_, London. These are very\r\ncomplete things of their kind. Mr. PARKES has, also, excellent Malt-Mills.\r\n\r\n99. In concluding this part of my Treatise, I cannot help expressing my\r\nhope of being instrumental in inducing a part of the labourers, at any\r\nrate, to bake their own bread; and, above all things, to abandon the use\r\nof \"Ireland's _lazy_ root.\" Nevertheless, so extensive is the erroneous\r\nopinion relative to this villanous root, that I really began to despair of\r\nchecking its cultivation and use, till I saw the declaration which Mr.\r\nWAKEFIELD had the good sense and the spirit to make before the\r\n\"AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE.\" Be it observed, too, that Mr. WAKEFIELD had\r\nhimself made a survey of the state of Ireland. What he saw there did not\r\nencourage him, doubtless, to be an advocate for the growing of this root\r\nof wretchedness. It is an undeniable fact, that, in the proportion that\r\nthis root is in use, as a _substitute for bread_, the people are wretched;\r\nthe reasons for which I have explained and enforced a hundred times over.\r\nMr. WILLIAM HANNING told the Committee that the labourers in his part of\r\nSomersetshire were \"almost wholly supplied with potatoes, _breakfast_ and\r\n_dinner_, brought them _in the fields_, and nothing but potatoes; and that\r\nthey used, in better times, to get a certain portion of bacon and cheese,\r\nwhich, on account of their \"poverty, they do not eat now.\" It is\r\nimpossible that men can be _contented_ in such a state of things: it is\r\nunjust to desire them to be contented: it is a state of misery and\r\ndegradation to which no part of any community can have any show of right\r\nto reduce another part: men so degraded have no protection; and it is a\r\ndisgrace to form part of a community to which they belong. This\r\ndegradation has been occasioned by a silent change in the value of the\r\nmoney of the country. This has purloined the wages of the labourer; it has\r\nreduced him by degrees to housel with the spider and the bat, and to feed\r\nwith the pig. It has changed the habits, and, in a great measure, the\r\ncharacter of the people. The sins of this system are enormous and\r\nundescribable; but, thank God! they seem to be approaching to their end!\r\nMoney is resuming its value, labour is recovering its price: let us hope\r\nthat the wretched potatoe is disappearing, and that we shall, once more,\r\nsee the knife in the labourer's hand and the loaf upon his board.\r\n\r\n[This was written in 1821. _Now_ (1823) we have had the experience of\r\n1822, when, for the first time, the world saw a considerable part of a\r\npeople, plunged into all the horrors of _famine_, at a moment when the\r\ngovernment of that nation declared _food to be abundant_! Yes, the year\r\n1822 saw Ireland in this state; saw the people of whole parishes receiving\r\nthe _extreme unction_ preparatory to yielding up their breath for want of\r\nfood; and this while large exports of meat and flour were taking place in\r\nthat country! But horrible as this was, disgraceful as it was to the name\r\nof Ireland, it was attended with this good effect: it brought out, from\r\nmany members of Parliament (in their places,) and from the public in\r\ngeneral, the acknowledgment, that the _misery_ and _degradation_ of the\r\nIrish were chiefly owing to the _use of the potatoe as the almost sole\r\nfood of the people_.]\r\n\r\n100. In my next number I shall treat of the _keeping of cows_. I have said\r\nthat I will teach the cottager how to keep a cow all the year round upon\r\nthe produce of a quarter of an acre, or, in other words, _forty rods_, of\r\nland; and, in my next, I will make good my promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV\r\n\r\nMAKING BREAD--(CONTINUED.)\r\n\r\n\r\n101. In the last number, at Paragraph 86, I observed that I hoped it was\r\nunnecessary for me to give any directions as to the mere _act_ of making\r\nbread. But several correspondents inform me that, without these\r\ndirections, a conviction of the utility of baking bread at home is of _no\r\nuse to them_. Therefore, I shall here give those directions, receiving my\r\ninstructions here from one, who, I thank God, does know how to perform\r\nthis act.\r\n\r\n102. Suppose the quantity be a bushel of flour. Put this flour into a\r\n_trough_ that people have for the purpose, or it may be in a clean smooth\r\ntub of any shape, if not too deep, and if sufficiently large. Make a\r\npretty deep hole in the middle of this heap of flour. Take (for a bushel)\r\na pint of good fresh yeast, mix it and stir it well up in a pint of _soft_\r\nwater milk-warm. Pour this into the hole in the heap of flour. Then take a\r\nspoon and work it round the outside of this body of moisture so as to\r\nbring into that body, by degrees, flour enough to make it form a _thin\r\nbatter_, which you must stir about well for a minute or two. Then take a\r\nhandful of flour and scatter it thinly over the head of this batter, so as\r\nto _hide_ it. Then cover the whole over with a cloth to keep it _warm_;\r\nand this covering, as well as the situation of the trough, as to distance\r\nfrom the fire, must depend on the nature of the place and state of the\r\nweather as to heat and cold. When you perceive that the batter has risen\r\nenough to make _cracks_ in the flour that you covered it over with, you\r\nbegin to form the whole mass into _dough_, thus: you begin round the hole\r\ncontaining the batter, working the flour into the batter, and pouring in,\r\nas it is wanted to make the flour mix with the batter, soft water\r\nmilk-warm, or milk, as hereafter to be mentioned. Before you begin this,\r\nyou scatter the _salt_ over the heap at the rate of _half a pound_ to a\r\nbushel of flour. When you have got the whole _sufficiently moist_, you\r\n_knead it well_. This is a grand part of the business; for, unless the\r\ndough be _well worked_, there will be _little round lumps of flour in the\r\nloaves_; and, besides, the original batter, which is to give fermentation\r\nto the whole, will not be duly mixed. The dough must, therefore, be well\r\nworked. The _fists_ must go heartily into it. It must be rolled over;\r\npressed out; folded up and pressed out again, until it be completely\r\nmixed, and formed into a _stiff_ and _tough dough_. This is _labour_,\r\nmind. I have never quite liked baker's bread since I saw a great heavy\r\nfellow, in a bakehouse in France, kneading bread with his _naked feet_!\r\nHis feet looked very _white_, to be sure: whether they were of that colour\r\n_before he got into the trough_ I could not tell. God forbid, that I\r\nshould suspect that this is ever done _in England_! It is _labour_; but,\r\nwhat is _exercise_ other than labour? Let a young woman bake a bushel once\r\na week, and she will do very well without phials and gallipots.\r\n\r\n103. Thus, then, the dough is made. And, when made, it is to be formed\r\ninto a lump in the middle of the trough, and, with a little dry flour\r\nthinly scattered over it, covered over again to be kept warm and to\r\nferment; and in this state, if all be done rightly, it will not have to\r\nremain more than about 15 or 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n104. In the mean while _the oven is to be heated_; and this is much more\r\nthan half the art of the operation. When an oven is properly heated, can\r\nbe known only by _actual observation_. Women who understand the matter,\r\nknow when the heat is right the moment they put their faces within a yard\r\nof the oven-mouth; and once or twice observing is enough for any person of\r\ncommon capacity. But this much may be said in the way of _rule_: that the\r\nfuel (I am supposing a brick oven) should be _dry_ (not _rotten_) wood,\r\nand not mere _brush-wood_, but rather _fagot-sticks_. If larger wood, it\r\nought to be split up into sticks not more than two, or two and a half\r\ninches through. Bush-wood that is _strong_, not green and not too old, if\r\nit be hard in its nature and has some _sticks_ in it, may do. The _woody_\r\nparts of furze, or ling, will heat an oven very well. But the thing is, to\r\nhave a _lively_ and yet _somewhat strong_ fire; so that the oven may be\r\nheated in about 15 minutes, and retain its heat sufficiently long.\r\n\r\n105. The oven should be hot by the time that the dough, as mentioned in\r\nParagraph 103, has remained in the lump about 20 minutes. When both are\r\nready, take out the fire, and wipe the oven out clean, and, at nearly\r\nabout the same moment, take the dough out upon the lid of the baking\r\ntrough, or some proper place, cut it up into pieces, and make it up into\r\nloaves, kneading it again into these separate parcels; and, as you go on,\r\nshaking a little flour over your board, to prevent the dough from adhering\r\nto it. The loaves should be put into the oven as _quickly_ as possible\r\nafter they are formed; when in, the oven-lid, or door, should be fastened\r\nup _very closely_; and, if all be properly managed, loaves of about the\r\nsize of quartern loaves will be sufficiently baked in about _two hours_.\r\nBut they usually take down the _lid_, and _look_ at the bread, in order to\r\nsee how it is going on.\r\n\r\n106. And what is there worthy of the name of _plague_, or _trouble_, in\r\nall this? Here is no dirt, no filth, no rubbish, no _litter_, no _slop_.\r\nAnd, pray, what can be pleasanter to _behold_? Talk, indeed, of your\r\npantomimes and gaudy shows; your processions and installations and\r\ncoronations! Give me, for a beautiful sight, a neat and smart woman,\r\nheating her oven and setting in her bread! And, if the bustle does make\r\nthe sign of labour glisten on her brow, where is the man that would not\r\nkiss that off, rather than lick the plaster from the cheek of a duchess.\r\n\r\n107. And what is the _result_? Why, good, wholesome food, sufficient for a\r\nconsiderable family for a week, prepared in three or four hours. To get\r\nthis quantity of food, fit to be _eaten_, in the shape of potatoes, _how\r\nmany fires_! what a washing, what a boiling, what a peeling, what a\r\nslopping, and what a messing! The cottage everlastingly in a litter; the\r\nwoman's hands everlastingly wet and dirty; the children grimed up to the\r\neyes with dust fixed on by potato-starch; and ragged as colts, the poor\r\nmother's time all being devoted to the everlasting boilings of the pot!\r\nCan any man, who knows any thing of the labourer's life, deny this? And\r\nwill, then, any body, except the old shuffle-breeches band of the\r\nQuarterly Review, who have all their lives been moving from garret to\r\ngarret, who have seldom seen the sun, and never the dew except in print;\r\nwill any body except these men say, that the people ought to be taught to\r\nuse potatoes as a _substitute for bread_?\r\n\r\n\r\nBREWING BEER.\r\n\r\n108. This matter has been fully treated of in the two last numbers. But\r\nseveral correspondents wishing to fall upon some means of rendering the\r\npractice beneficial to those who are _unable to purchase_ brewing\r\nutensils, have recommended the _lending_ of them, or letting out, round a\r\nneighbourhood. Another correspondent has, therefore, pointed out to me _an\r\nAct of Parliament_ which touches upon this subject; and, indeed, what of\r\nExcise Laws and Custom Laws and Combination Laws and Libel Laws, a human\r\nbeing in this country scarcely knows what he dares do or what he dares\r\nsay. What father, for instance, would have imagined, that, having brewing\r\nutensils, which two men carry from house to house as easily as they can a\r\nbasket, _he dared not lend them to his son, living in the next street, or\r\nat the next door_? Yet such really is the law; for, according to the Act\r\n5th of the 22 and 23 of that honest and sincere gentleman Charles II.,\r\nthere is a penalty of 50_l._ for lending or letting brewing utensils.\r\nHowever, it has this limit; that the penalty is confined to _Cities_,\r\n_Corporate Towns_, and _Market Towns_, WHERE THERE IS A PUBLIC BREWHOUSE.\r\nSo that, in the first place, you may let, or lend, in _any_ place where\r\nthere is _no public brewhouse_; and in all towns not _corporate or\r\nmarket_, and in all villages, hamlets, and scattered places.\r\n\r\n109. Another thing is, can a man who has brewed beer at his own house in\r\nthe country, bring that beer into town to his own house, and for the use\r\nof his family there? This has been asked of me. I cannot give a positive\r\nanswer without reading about _seven large volumes in quarto of taxing\r\nlaws_. The best way would be to _try it_; and, if any penalty, pay it by\r\n_subscription_, if that would not come under the law of _conspiracy_!\r\nHowever, I _think_, there can be no danger here. So monstrous a thing as\r\nthis can, surely, not exist. If there be such a law, it is daily violated;\r\nfor nothing is more common than for country gentlemen, who have a dislike\r\nto die by poison, bringing their home-brewed beer to London.\r\n\r\n110. Another correspondent recommends _parishes to make their own malt_.\r\nBut, surely, the landlords mean to get rid of the _malt and salt tax_!\r\nMany dairies, I dare say, pay 50_l._ a year each in salt tax. How, then,\r\nare they to contend against Irish butter and Dutch butter and cheese? And\r\nas to the malt tax, it is a dreadful drain from the land. I have heard of\r\nlabourers, living \"in _unkent places_,\" making their _own malt_, even now!\r\nNothing is so easy as to make your own malt, if you were permitted. You\r\nsoak the barley about three days (according to the state of the weather.)\r\nand then you put it upon stones or bricks _and keep it turned_, till the\r\nroot _shoots out_; and then to know when to _stop_, and to put it to dry,\r\ntake up a corn (which you will find nearly transparent) and look through\r\nthe skin of it. You will see the _spear_, that is to say, the shoot that\r\nwould come out of the ground, pushing on towards the _point_ of the\r\nbarley-corn. It starts from the bottom, where the root comes out; and it\r\ngoes on towards the other end; and would, if _kept moist_, come out at\r\nthat other end when the root was about an inch long. So that, when you\r\nhave got the _root to start_, by soaking and turning in heap, the spear is\r\n_on its way_. If you look in through the skin, you will see it; and now\r\nobserve; when the _point of the spear_ has got along as far as the\r\n_middle of the barley-corn_, you should take your barley and _dry it_. How\r\neasy would every family, and especially every farmer, do this, if it were\r\nnot for the punishment attached to it! The persons in the \"unkent places\"\r\nbefore mentioned, dry the malt in their _oven_! But let us hope that the\r\nlabourer will soon be able to get malt without exposing himself to\r\npunishment as a _violater of the law_.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING COWS.\r\n\r\n111. As to the _use_ of _milk_ and of that which proceeds from milk, in a\r\nfamily, very little need be said. At a certain age bread and milk are\r\n_all_ that a child wants. At a later age they furnish one meal a day for\r\nchildren. Milk is, at all seasons, good to _drink_. In the making of\r\npuddings, and in the making of _bread_ too, how useful is it! Let any one\r\nwho has eaten none but baker's bread for a good while, taste bread\r\nhome-baked, mixed with milk instead of with water; and he will find what\r\nthe difference is. There is this only to be observed, that in _hot\r\nweather_, bread mixed with milk will not _keep so long_ as that mixed with\r\nwater. It will of course turn _sour_ sooner.\r\n\r\n112. Whether the milk of a cow be to be consumed by a cottage family in\r\nthe shape of milk, or whether it be to be made to yield butter, skim-milk,\r\nand buttermilk, must depend on circumstances. A woman that has no child,\r\nor only one, would, perhaps, find it best to make _some butter_ at any\r\nrate. Besides, skim-milk and bread (the milk being boiled) is quite strong\r\nfood enough for any children's breakfast, even when they begin to go to\r\nwork; a fact which I state upon the most ample and satisfactory\r\nexperience, very seldom having ever had any other sort of breakfast myself\r\ntill I was more than ten years old, and I was in the fields at work full\r\nfour years before that. I will here mention that it gave me singular\r\npleasure to see a boy, just turned of _six_, helping his father to _reap_,\r\nin Sussex, this last summer. He did little, to be sure; but it was\r\n_something_. His father set him into the ridge at a great distance before\r\nhim; and when he came up to the place, he found a _sheaf_ cut; and, those\r\nwho know what it is to reap, know how pleasant it is to find now and then\r\na sheaf cut ready to their hand. It was no small thing to see a boy fit to\r\nbe trusted with so dangerous a thing as a reap-hook in his hands, at an\r\nage when \"young masters\" have nursery-maids to cut their victuals for\r\nthem, and to see that they do not fall out of the window, tumble down\r\nstairs, or run under carriage-wheels or horses' bellies. Was not this\r\nfather discharging his duty by this boy much better than he would have\r\nbeen by sending him to a place called a _school_? The boy is in a school\r\nhere; and an excellent school too: the school of useful labour. I must\r\nhear a great deal more than I ever have heard, to convince me, that\r\nteaching children to _read_ tends so much to their happiness, their\r\nindependence of spirit, their manliness of character, as teaching them to\r\n_reap_. The creature that is in _want_ must be a _slave_; and to be\r\nhabituated _to labour cheerfully_ is the only means of preventing\r\nnineteen-twentieths of mankind from being in want. I have digressed here;\r\nbut observations of this sort can, in my opinion, never be too often\r\nrepeated; especially at a time when all sorts of mad projects are on foot,\r\nfor what is falsely called _educating_ the people, and when some would do\r\nthis by a _tax_ that would compel the single man to give part of his\r\nearnings to teach the married man's children to read and write.\r\n\r\n113. Before I quit the _uses_ to which milk may be put, let me mention,\r\nthat, as mere _drink_, it is, unless perhaps in case of heavy labour,\r\nbetter, in my opinion, than any beer, however good. I have drinked little\r\nelse for the last five years, at any time of the day. Skim-milk I mean. If\r\nyou have not milk enough to wet up your bread with (for a bushel of flour\r\nrequires about 16 to 18 pints,) you make up the quantity with water, of\r\ncourse; or, which is a very good way, with water that has been put,\r\nboiling hot, upon _bran_, and then drained off. This takes the goodness\r\nout of the bran to be sure; but _really good bread_ is a thing of so much\r\nimportance, that it always ought to be the very first object in domestic\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n114. The cases vary so much, that it is impossible to lay down rules for\r\nthe application of the produce of a cow, which rules shall fit all cases.\r\nI content myself, therefore, with what has already been said on this\r\nsubject; and shall only make an observation on the _act of milking_,\r\nbefore I come to the chief matter; namely, the _getting of the food for\r\nthe cow_. A cow should be milked _clean_. Not a drop, if it can be\r\navoided, should be left in the udder. It has been proved that the half\r\npint that comes out _last_ has _twelve times_, I think it is, as much\r\nbutter in it, as the half pint that comes out _first_. I tried the milk of\r\nten Alderney cows, and, as nearly as I, without being very nice about the\r\nmatter, could ascertain, I found the difference to be about what I have\r\nstated. The udder would seem to be a sort of milk-pan in which the cream\r\nis uppermost, and, of course, comes out last, seeing that the outlet is at\r\nthe bottom. But, besides this, if you do not milk clean, the cow will give\r\nless and less milk, and will become dry much sooner than she ought. The\r\n_cause_ of this I do not know, but experience has long established the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n115. In providing food for a cow we must look, first, at the _sort of\r\ncow_; seeing that a cow of one sort will certainly require more than twice\r\nas much food as a cow of another sort. For a cottage, a cow of the\r\nsmallest sort common in England is, on every account, the best; and such a\r\ncow will not require above 70 or 80 pounds of good moist food in the\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n116. Now, how to raise this food on 40 rods of ground is what we want to\r\nknow. It frequently happens that a labourer has _more_ than 40 rods of\r\nground. It more frequently happens, that he has some _common_, some\r\n_lane_, some little out-let or other, for a part of the year, at least. In\r\nsuch cases he may make a different disposition of his ground; or may do\r\nwith less than the 40 rods. I am here, for simplicity's sake, to suppose,\r\nthat he have 40 rods of clear, unshaded land, besides what his house and\r\nsheds stand upon; and that he have nothing further in the way of means to\r\nkeep his cow.\r\n\r\n117. I suppose the 40 rods to be _clean_ and _unshaded_; for I am to\r\nsuppose, that when a man thinks of 5 quarts _of milk a day_, on an\r\naverage, all the year round, he will not suffer his ground to be\r\nencumbered by apple-trees that give him only the means of treating his\r\nchildren to fits of the belly-ache, or with currant and gooseberry bushes,\r\nwhich, though their fruit do very well to _amuse_, really give nothing\r\nworthy of the name of _food_, except to the blackbirds and thrushes. The\r\nground is to be _clear_ of trees; and, in the spring, we will suppose it\r\nto be _clean_. Then, dig it up _deeply_, or, which is better, _trench_ it,\r\nkeeping, however, the top _spit_ of the soil _at the top_. Lay it in\r\n_ridges_ in April or May about two feet apart, and made high and sharp.\r\nWhen the weeds appear about three inches high, turn the ridges into the\r\nfurrows (_never moving the ground but in dry weather_,) and bury all the\r\nweeds. Do this as often as the weeds get three inches high; and by the\r\nfall, you will have really clean ground, and not poor ground.\r\n\r\n118. There is the ground then, ready. About the 26th of August, but _not\r\nearlier_, prepare a rod of your ground; and put some _manure_ in it (for\r\n_some_ you must have,) and sow one half of it with Early York Cabbage\r\nSeed, and the other half with Sugar-loaf Cabbage Seed, both of the _true_\r\nsort, in little drills at 8 inches apart, and the seeds thin in the drill.\r\nIf the plants come up at two inches apart (and they should be thinned if\r\nthicker,) you will have a plenty. As soon as fairly out of ground, hoe the\r\nground nicely, and pretty deeply, and again in a few days. When the plants\r\nhave six leaves, which will be very soon, dig up, make fine, and manure\r\nanother rod or two, and prick out the plants, 4000 of each in rows at\r\neight inches apart and three inches in the row. Hoe the ground between\r\nthem often, and they will grow fast and be _straight_ and strong. I\r\nsuppose that these beds for plants take 4 rods of your ground. Early in\r\nNovember, or, as the weather may serve, a little earlier or later, lay\r\nsome manure (of which I shall say more hereafter) between the ridges, in\r\nthe other 36 rods, and turn the ridges over on this manure, and then\r\ntransplant your plants on the ridges at 15 inches apart. Here they will\r\nstand the winter; and you must see that the slugs do not eat them. If any\r\nplants fail, you have plenty in the bed where you prick them out; for your\r\n36 rods will not require more than 4000 plants. If the winter be very\r\nhard, and bad for plants, you cannot _cover_ 36 rods; but you may the\r\n_bed_ where the rest of your plants are. A little litter, or straw, or\r\ndead grass, or fern, laid along between the rows and the plants, not to\r\ncover the leaves, will preserve them completely. When people complain of\r\n_all_ their plants being \"_cut off_,\" they have, in fact nothing to\r\n_complain_ of but their own extreme carelessness. If I had a gardener who\r\ncomplained of _all_ his plants being cut off, I should cut him off pretty\r\nquickly. If those in the 36 rods fail, or fail in part, fill up their\r\nplaces, later in the winter, by plants from the bed.\r\n\r\n119. If you find the ground dry at the top during the winter, hoe it, and\r\nparticularly near the plants, and rout out all slugs and insects. And when\r\nMarch comes, and the ground _is dry_, hoe deep and well, and earth the\r\nplants up close to the lower leaves. As soon as the plants begin to\r\n_grow_, dig the ground with a spade clean and well, and let the spade go\r\nas near to the plants as you can without actually _displacing the plants_.\r\nGive them another digging in a month; and, if weeds come in the\r\nmean-while, _hoe_, and let not one live a week. Oh! \"what a deal of\r\n_work_!\" Well! but it is for _yourself_, and, besides, it is not all to be\r\ndone in a day; and we shall by-and-by see what it is altogether.\r\n\r\n120. By the first of June; I speak of the South of England, and there is\r\nalso some difference in seasons and soils; but, generally speaking, by the\r\nfirst of June you will have _turned-in cabbages_, and soon you will have\r\nthe Early Yorks _solid_. And by the first of June you may get your cow,\r\none that is about to calve, or that has just calved, and at this time such\r\na cow as you will want will not, thank God, cost above five pounds.\r\n\r\n121. I shall speak of the place to keep her in, and of the manure and\r\nlitter, by-and-by. At present I confine myself to her mere food. The 36\r\nrods, if the cabbages all stood till they got _solid_, would give her food\r\nfor 200 days, at 80 pounds weight per day, which is more than she would\r\neat. But you must use some, at first, that are not solid; and, then, some\r\nof them will split before you can use them. But you will have pigs to help\r\noff with them, and to gnaw the heads of the stumps. Some of the\r\nsugar-loaves may have been planted out in the spring; and thus these 36\r\nrods will get you along to some time in September.\r\n\r\n122. Now mind, in March, and again in April, sow more _Early Yorks_, and\r\nget them to be fine stout plants, as you did those in the fall. Dig up the\r\nground and manure it, and, as fast as you cut cabbages, plant cabbages;\r\nand in the same manner and with the same cultivation as before. Your last\r\nplanting will be about the middle of August, with _stout plants_, and\r\nthese will serve you into the month of November.\r\n\r\n123. Now we have to provide from _December to May inclusive_; and that,\r\ntoo, out of this same piece of ground. In November there must be, arrived\r\nat perfection, 3000 turnip plants. These, _without the greens_, must\r\nweigh, on an average, 5 pounds, and this, at 80 pounds a day, will keep\r\nthe cow 187 days; and there are but 182 days in these six months. The\r\ngreens will have helped put the latest cabbages to carry you through\r\nNovember, and perhaps into December. But for these six months, you must\r\n_depend_ on nothing but the Swedish turnips.\r\n\r\n124. And now, how are these to be had _upon the same ground that bears_\r\nthe cabbages? That we are now going to see. When you plant out your\r\ncabbages at the out-set, put first a row of Early Yorks, then a row of\r\nSugar-loaves, and so on throughout the piece. Of course, as you are to use\r\nthe Early Yorks first, you will cut every other row; and the Early Yorks\r\nthat you are to plant in summer will go into the intervals. By-and-by the\r\nSugar-loaves are cut away, and in their place will come Swedish turnips,\r\nyou digging and manuring the ground as in the case of the cabbages: and,\r\nat last, you will find about 16 rods where you will have found it too\r\nlate, and _unnecessary_ besides, to plant any second crop of cabbages.\r\nHere the Swedish turnips will stand in rows at two feet apart, (and always\r\na foot apart in the row,) and thus you will have three thousand turnips;\r\nand if these do not weigh five pounds each on an average, the fault must\r\nbe in the _seed_ or in the management.\r\n\r\n125. The Swedish turnips are raised in this manner. You will bear in mind\r\nthe _four rods_ of ground in which you have sowed and pricked out your\r\ncabbage plants. The plants that will be left there will, in April, serve\r\nyou for _greens_, if you ever eat any, though bread and bacon are very\r\ngood without greens, and rather better than with. At any rate, the pig,\r\nwhich has strong powers of digestion, will consume this herbage. In a part\r\nof these four rods you will, in March and April, as before directed, have\r\nsown and raised your Early Yorks for the summer planting. Now, in the\r\n_last week of May_, prepare a quarter of a rod of this ground, and sow it,\r\nprecisely as directed for the Cabbage-seed, with Swedish turnip-seed; and\r\nsow a quarter of a rod _every three days_, till you have sowed _two rods_.\r\nIf the _fly appear_, cover the rows over in the _day-time_ with cabbage\r\nleaves, and take the leaves off at night; hoe well between the plants; and\r\nwhen they are safe from the fly, _thin_ them to four inches apart in the\r\nrow. The two rods will give you nearly _five thousand plants_, which is\r\n2000 more than you will want. From this bed you draw your plants to\r\ntransplant in the ground where the cabbages have stood, as before\r\ndirected. You should transplant none much _before_ the middle of July, and\r\nnot much _later_ than the middle of August. In the two rods, whence you\r\ntake your turnip plants, you may leave plants to come to perfection, at\r\ntwo feet distances each way; and this will give you _over and above_, 840\r\npounds weight of turnips. For the other two rods will be ground enough for\r\nyou to sow your cabbage plants in at the end of August, as directed for\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n126. I should now proceed to speak of the manner of harvesting,\r\npreserving, and using the crops; of the manner of feeding the cow; of the\r\nshed for her; of the managing of the manure, and several other less\r\nimportant things; but these, for want of room here, must be reserved for\r\nthe beginning of my next Number. After, therefore, observing that the\r\nTurnip plants must be transplanted in the same way that Cabbage plants\r\nare; and that both ought to be transplanted in _dry_ weather and in ground\r\njust _fresh digged_, I shall close this Number with the notice of two\r\npoints which I am most anxious to impress upon the mind of every reader.\r\n\r\n127. The first is, whether these crops give an _ill taste_ to milk and\r\nbutter. It is very certain, that the taste and smell of certain sorts of\r\ncattle-food will do this; for, in some parts of America, where the wild\r\n_garlick_, of which the cows are very fond, and which, like other\r\nbulbous-rooted plants, springs before the grass, not only the milk and\r\nbutter have a strong taste of garlick, but even the _veal_, when the\r\ncalves suck milk from such sources. None can be more common expressions,\r\nthan, in Philadelphia market, are those of _Garlicky Butter_ and _Garlicky\r\nVeal_, I have distinctly tasted the _Whiskey_ in milk of cows fed on\r\ndistiller's wash. It is also certain, that, if the cow eat _putrid_ leaves\r\nof cabbages and turnips, the butter will be offensive. And the\r\nwhite-turnip, which is at best but a poor thing, and often half putrid,\r\nmakes miserable butter. The large _cattle-cabbage_, which, when loaved\r\nhard, has a strong and even an offensive smell, will give a bad taste and\r\nsmell to milk and butter, whether there be putrid leaves or not. If you\r\nboil one of these rank cabbages, the water is extremely offensive to the\r\nsmell. But I state upon positive and recent experience, that Early York\r\nand Sugar-loaf Cabbages will yield as sweet milk and butter _as any food\r\nthat can be given to a cow_. During this last summer, I have, with the\r\nexception about to be noticed, kept, from the 1st of May to the 22d of\r\nOctober, _five cows_ upon the grass _of two acres and a quarter of ground,\r\nthe grass_ being generally _cut up for them_ and given to them in the\r\nstall. I had in the spring 5000 cabbage plants, intended for my pigs,\r\neleven in number. But the pigs could not eat _half_ their allowance,\r\nthough they were not very small when they began upon it. We were compelled\r\nto resort to the aid of the cows; and, in order to see _the effect on the\r\nmilk and butter_, we did not _mix_ the food; but gave the cows two\r\n_distinct spells_ at the cabbages, each spell about 10 _days in duration_.\r\nThe cabbages were cut off the stump with little or no care about _dead\r\nleaves_. And sweeter, finer butter, butter of a finer colour, than these\r\ncabbages made, never was made in this world. I never had better from cows\r\nfeeding in the sweetest pasture. Now, as to _Swedish turnips_, they do\r\ngive a little taste, especially if boiling of the milk pans be neglected,\r\nand if the greatest care be not taken about _all_ the dairy tackle. Yet we\r\nhave, for months together, had the butter so fine from Swedish turnips,\r\nthat nobody could well distinguish it from grass-butter. But to secure\r\nthis, there must be no _sluttishness_. Churn, pans, pail, shelves, wall,\r\nfloor, and all about the dairy, must be clean; and, above all things, the\r\npans must be _boiled_. However, after all, it is not here a case of\r\ndelicacy of smell so refined as to faint at any thing that meets it except\r\nthe stink of perfumes. If the butter do taste a little of the Swedish\r\nturnip, it will do very well where there is plenty of that sweet sauce\r\nwhich early rising and bodily labour are ever sure to bring.\r\n\r\n128. The _other point_ (about which I am still more anxious) is the\r\n_seed_; for if the seed be not _sound_, and especially if it be not _true\r\nto its kind_, all your labour _is in vain_. It is best, if you can do it,\r\nto get your seed from some friend, or some one that you know and can\r\ntrust. If you save seed, observe all the precautions mentioned in my book\r\non _Gardening_. This very year I have some Swedish turnips, _so called_,\r\nabout 7000 in number, and should, if my seed had been _true_, have had\r\nabout _twenty tons_ weight; instead of which I have about _three_! Indeed,\r\nthey are not _Swedish turnips_, but a sort of mixture between that plant\r\nand _rape_. I am sure the seedsman did not wilfully deceive me. He was\r\ndeceived himself. The truth is, that seedsmen are compelled to _buy_ their\r\nseeds of this plant. _Farmers_ save it; and they but too often pay very\r\nlittle attention to the manner of doing it. The best way is to get a dozen\r\nof fine turnip plants, perfect in all respects, and plant them in a\r\nsituation where the smell of the blossoms of nothing of the cabbage or\r\nrape or turnip or even _charlock_ kind, can reach them. The seed will keep\r\nperfectly good for _four years_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V\r\n\r\nKEEPING COWS--(_continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n129. I have now, in the conclusion of this article, to speak of the manner\r\nof _harvesting_ and _preserving_ the _Swedes_; of the place _to keep the\r\ncow in_; of the _manure_ for the land; and of the _quantity of labour_\r\nthat the cultivation of the land and the harvesting of the crop will\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n130. _Harvesting and preserving the Swedes._ When they are ready to take\r\nup, the tops must be cut off, if not cut off before, and also the _roots_;\r\nbut neither tops nor roots should be cut off _very close_. You will have\r\nroom for ten bushels of the _bulbs_ in the house, or shed. Put the rest\r\ninto ten-bushel heaps. Make the heap _upon_ the ground in a _round form_,\r\nand let it rise up to a point. Lay over it a little litter, straw, or dead\r\ngrass, about three inches thick, and then earth upon that about six inches\r\nthick. Then cut a thin round _green turf_, about eighteen inches over, and\r\nput it upon the crown of the heap to prevent the earth from being washed\r\noff. Thus these heaps will remain till wanted for use. When given to the\r\ncow, it will be best to _wash_ the Swedes and cut each into two or three\r\npieces with a spade or some other tool. You can take in ten bushels at a\r\ntime. If you find them _sprouting_ in the spring, open the remaining\r\nheaps, and expose them to the sun and wind; and cover them again slightly\r\nwith straw or litter of some sort.[6]\r\n\r\n131. _As to the place to keep the cow in_, much will depend upon\r\n_situation_ and circumstances. I am always supposing that the cottage is a\r\nreal _cottage_, and not a house in a town or village street; though,\r\nwherever there is the quarter of an acre of ground, the cow _may_ be kept.\r\nLet me, however, suppose that which will generally happen; namely, that\r\nthe cottage stands by the side of a road, or lane, and amongst fields and\r\nwoods, if not on the side of a common. To pretend to tell a country\r\nlabourer how to build a shed for a cow, how to stick it up against the end\r\nof his house, or to make it an independent erection; or to dwell on the\r\nmaterials, where poles, rods, wattles, rushes, furze, heath, and\r\ncooper-chips, are all to be gotten by him for nothing or next to nothing,\r\nwould be useless; because a man who, thus situated, can be at any loss for\r\na shed for his cow, is not only unfit to keep a cow, but unfit to keep a\r\ncat. The warmer the shed is the better it is. The floor should _slope_,\r\nbut not too much. There are _stones_, of some sort or other, every-where,\r\nand about six wheel-barrow-fulls will _pave_ the shed, a thing to be by no\r\nmeans neglected. A broad trough, or box, fixed up at the head of the cow,\r\nis the thing to give her food in; and she should be fed three times a day,\r\nat least; always at _day-light_ and at _sun-set_. It is not _absolutely\r\nnecessary_ that a cow ever quit her shed, except just at calving time, or\r\nwhen taken to the bull. In the former case the time is, nine times out of\r\nten, known to within forty-eight hours. Any enclosed field or place will\r\ndo for her during a day or two; and for such purpose, if there be not room\r\nat home, no man will refuse place for her in a fallow field. It will,\r\nhowever, be good, where there is no _common_ to turn her out upon, to have\r\nher led by a string, two or three times a week, which may be done by a\r\nchild only five years old, to graze, or pick, along the sides of roads and\r\nlanes. Where there is a _common_, she will, of course, be turned out in\r\nthe day time, except in very wet or severe weather; and in a case like\r\nthis, a smaller quantity of ground will suffice for the keeping of her.\r\nAccording to the present practice, a miserable \"_tallet_\" of bad hay is,\r\nin such cases, the winter provision for the cow. It can scarcely be called\r\nfood; and the consequence is, the cow is both _dry_ and _lousy_ nearly\r\nhalf the year; instead of being dry only about fifteen days before\r\ncalving, and being sleek and lusty at the end of the winter, to which a\r\n_warm lodging_ greatly contributes. For, observe, if you keep a cow, any\r\ntime between September and June, out in a field or yard, to endure the\r\nchances of the weather, she will not, though she have food precisely the\r\nsame in quantity and quality, yield above _two-thirds_ as much as if she\r\nwere lodged in house; and in _wet_ weather she will not yield _half_ so\r\nmuch. It is not so much the _cold_ as the _wet_ that is injurious to all\r\nour stock in England.\r\n\r\n132. _The Manure._ At the _beginning_ this must be provided by collections\r\nmade on the road; by the results of the residence in a cottage. Let any\r\nman clean out _every place_ about his dwelling; rake and scrape and sweep\r\nall into a heap; and he will find that he has a _great deal_. Earth of\r\nalmost any sort that has long lain on the surface, and has been trodden\r\non, is a species of manure. Every act that tends to neatness round a\r\ndwelling, tends to the creating of a mass of manure. And I have very\r\nseldom seen a cottage, with a plat of ground of a quarter of an acre\r\nbelonging to it, round about which I could not have collected a very large\r\nheap of manure. Every thing of animal or vegetable substance that comes\r\ninto a house, must _go out of it again_, in one shape or another. The very\r\nemptying of vessels of various kinds, on a heap of common earth, makes it\r\na heap of the best of manure. Thus goes on the work of _reproduction_; and\r\nthus is verified the words of the Scripture, \"_Flesh is grass_, and there\r\nis _nothing new under the sun_.\" Thus far as to the _outset_. When you\r\nhave _got the cow_, there is no more care about manure; for, and\r\nespecially if you have a _pig_ also, you must have enough annually for _an\r\nacre_ of ground. And let it be observed, that, after a time, it will be\r\nunnecessary, and would be injurious, to manure _for every crop_; for that\r\nwould produce more stalk and green than substantial part; as it is well\r\nknown, that wheat plants, standing in ground too full of manure, will\r\nyield very thick and long _straws_, but grains of little or no substance.\r\nYou ought to depend more on the spade and the hoe than on the dung-heap.\r\nNevertheless, the greatest care should be taken to preserve the manure;\r\nbecause you will want _straw_, unless you be by the side of a common which\r\ngives you rushes, grassy furze, or fern; and to get straw you must give a\r\npart of your dung from the cow-stall and pig-sty. The best way to preserve\r\nmanure, is to have a pit of sufficient dimensions close behind the\r\ncow-shed and pig-sty, for the run from these to go into, and from which\r\nall runs of _rain water_ should be kept. Into this pit would go the\r\nemptying of the shed and of the sty, and the produce of all sweepings and\r\ncleanings round the house; and thus a large mass of manure would soon grow\r\ntogether. Much too large a quantity for a quarter of an acre of ground.\r\nOne good load of wheat or rye straw is all that you would want for the\r\nwinter, and half of one for the summer; and you would have more than\r\nenough dung to exchange against this straw.\r\n\r\n133. Now, as to _the quantity of labour_ that the cultivation of the land\r\nwill demand in _a year_. We will suppose the whole to have _five complete\r\ndiggings_, and say nothing about the little matters of sowing and planting\r\nand hoeing and harvesting, all which are a mere trifle. We are supposing\r\nthe owner to be _an able labouring man_; and such a man will dig 12 rods\r\nof ground in a day. Here are 200 rods to be digged, and here are little\r\nless than 17 days of work at 12 hours in the day; or 200 _hours'_ work, to\r\nbe done in the course of the long days of spring and summer, while it is\r\nlight long before _six_ in the morning, and long after six at night. What\r\n_is it_, then? Is it not better than time spent in the ale-house, or in\r\ncreeping about after a miserable hare? Frequently, and most frequently,\r\nthere will be a _boy_, if not two, big enough to help. And (I only give\r\nthis as a _hint_) I saw, on the 7th of November last (1822,) _a very\r\npretty woman_, in the village of _Hannington, in Wiltshire, digging_ a\r\npiece of ground and planting it with Early Cabbages, which she did as\r\nhandily and as neatly as any gardener that ever I saw. The ground was\r\n_wet_, and therefore, _to avoid treading the digged ground in that state_,\r\nshe had her line extended, and put in the rows as she advanced in her\r\ndigging, standing _in the trench_ while she performed the act of planting,\r\nwhich she did with great nimbleness and precision. Nothing could be more\r\nskilfully or beautifully done. Her clothes were neat, clean, and tight\r\nabout her. She had turned her handkerchief down from her neck, which, with\r\nthe glow that the work had brought into her cheeks, formed an object which\r\nI do not say would have made me _actually stop my chaise_, had it not been\r\nfor the occupation in which she was engaged; but, all taken together, the\r\ntemptation was too strong to be resisted. But there is the _Sunday_; and I\r\nknow of no law, human or divine, that forbids a labouring man to dig or\r\nplant his garden on Sunday, if the good of his family demand it; and if\r\nhe cannot, without injury to that family, find other time to do it in.\r\nShepherds, carters, pigfeeders, drovers, coachmen, cooks, footmen,\r\nprinters, and numerous others, work on the Sundays. Theirs are deemed by\r\nthe law _works of necessity_. Harvesting and haymaking are allowed to be\r\ncarried on on the Sunday, in certain cases; when they are always carried\r\non by _provident farmers_. And I should be glad to know the case which is\r\nmore a _case of necessity_ than that now under our view. In fact, the\r\nlabouring people _do work on the Sunday_ morning in particular, all over\r\nthe country, at something or other, or they are engaged in pursuits a good\r\ndeal less religious than that of digging and planting. So that, as to _the\r\n200 hours_, they are easily found, without the loss of any of the time\r\nrequired for constant daily labour.\r\n\r\n134. And what a _produce_ is that of a cow! I suppose only an average of\r\n5 _quarts of milk a day_. If made into butter, it will be _equal every\r\nweek to two days of the man's wages_, besides the value of the skim milk:\r\nand this can hardly be of less value than another day's wages. What a\r\nthing, then, is this cow, if she earn half as much as the man! I am\r\ngreatly under-rating her produce; but I wish to put all the advantages at\r\nthe lowest. To be sure, there is work for the wife, or daughter, to milk\r\nand make butter. But the former is done at the two ends of the day, and\r\nthe latter only about once in the week. And, whatever these may subtract\r\nfrom the _labours of the field_, which all country women ought to be\r\nengaged in whenever they conveniently can; whatever the cares created by\r\nthe cow may subtract from these, is amply compensated for by the\r\n_education_ that these cares will give to the children. They will _all_\r\nlearn to milk,[7] and the girls to make butter. And which is a thing of\r\nthe very first importance, they will all learn, from their infancy, to\r\n_set a just value upon dumb animals_, and will grow up in the _habit_ of\r\ntreating them with gentleness and feeding them with care. To those who\r\nhave not been brought up in the midst of rural affairs, it is hardly\r\npossible to give an adequate idea of the importance of this part of\r\n_education_. I should be very loth to intrust the care of my horses,\r\ncattle, sheep, or pigs, to any one whose father never had cow or pig of\r\nhis _own_. It is a general complaint, that servants, and especially\r\nfarm-servants, are not _so good as they used to be_. How should they? They\r\nwere formerly the sons and daughters of _small farmers_; they are now the\r\nprogeny of miserable property-less labourers. They have never seen an\r\nanimal in which they had any interest. They are careless by habit. This\r\nmonstrous evil has arisen from causes which I have a thousand times\r\ndescribed; and which causes must now be speedily removed; or, they will\r\nproduce a dissolution of society, and give us a _beginning afresh_.\r\n\r\n135. The circumstances vary so much, that it is impossible to lay down\r\nprecise rules suited to all cases. The cottage may be on the side of a\r\nforest or common; it may be on the side of a lane or of a great road,\r\ndistant from town or village; it may be on the skirts of one of these\r\nlatter: and then, again, the family may be few or great in number, the\r\nchildren small or big, according to all which circumstances, the extent\r\nand application of the cow-food, and also the application of the produce,\r\nwill naturally be regulated. Under some circumstances, half the above crop\r\nmay be enough; especially where good commons are at hand. Sometimes it may\r\nbe the best way to sell the calf as soon as calved; at others, to fat it;\r\nand, at others, if you cannot sell it, which sometimes happens, to knock\r\nit on the head as soon as calved; for, where there is a family of small\r\nchildren, the price of a calf of two months old cannot be equal to the\r\nhalf of the value of the two months' milk. It is pure weakness to call it\r\n\"_a pity_.\" It is a much greater pity to see hungry children crying for\r\nthe milk that a calf is sucking to no useful purpose; and as to the cow\r\nand the calf, the one must lose her young, and the other its life, after\r\nall; and the respite only makes an addition to the sufferings of both.\r\n\r\n136. As to the pretended _unwholesomeness_ of milk in certain cases; as to\r\nits not being adapted to _some constitutions_, I do not believe one word\r\nof the matter. When we talk of the _fruits_, indeed, which were formerly\r\nthe chief food of a great part of mankind, we should recollect, that those\r\nfruits grew in countries that had a _sun to ripen_ the fruits, and to put\r\nnutritious matter into them. But as to _milk_, England yields to no\r\ncountry upon the face of the earth. Neat cattle will touch nothing that is\r\nnot wholesome in its nature; nothing that is not wholly innoxious. Out of\r\na pail that has ever had grease in it, they will not drink a drop, though\r\nthey be raging with thirst. Their very breath is fragrance. And how, then,\r\nis it possible, that unwholesomeness should distil from the udder of a\r\ncow? The milk varies, indeed, in its quality and taste according to the\r\nvariations in the nature of the food; but no food will a cow touch that is\r\nany way hostile to health. Feed young puppies upon _milk from the cow_,\r\nand they will never die with that ravaging disease called \"_the\r\ndistemper_.\" In short, to suppose that milk contains any thing essentially\r\nunwholesome is monstrous. When, indeed, the appetite becomes vitiated:\r\nwhen the organs have been long accustomed to food of a more stimulating\r\nnature; when it has been resolved to eat ragouts at dinner, and drink\r\nwine, and to swallow \"a devil,\" and a glass of strong grog at night; then\r\nmilk for breakfast may be \"_heavy_\" and disgusting, and the feeder may\r\nstand in need of tea or laudanum, which differ only as to degrees of\r\nstrength. But, and I speak from the most ample experience, milk is not\r\n\"_heavy_,\" and much less is it _unwholesome_, when he who uses it rises\r\nearly, never swallows strong drink, and never _stuffs_ himself with flesh\r\nof any kind. Many and many a day I scarcely taste of meat, and then\r\nchiefly at _breakfast_, and that, too, at an early hour. Milk is the\r\nnatural food of _young people_; if it be too rich, _skim_ it again and\r\nagain till it be not too rich. This is an evil easily cured. If you have\r\nnow to _begin_ with a family of children, they may not like it at first.\r\nBut _persevere_; and the parent who does not do this, having the means in\r\nhis hands, shamefully neglects his duty. A son who prefers a \"devil\" and a\r\nglass of grog to a hunch of bread and a bowl of cold milk, I regard as a\r\npest; and for this pest the father has to thank himself.\r\n\r\n137. Before I dismiss this article, let me offer an observation or two to\r\nthose persons who live in the vicinity of towns, or in towns, and who,\r\nthough they have _large gardens_, have \"_no land to keep a cow_,\" a\r\ncircumstance which they \"_exceedingly regret_.\" I have, I dare say,\r\nwitnessed this case at least a thousand times. Now, how much garden ground\r\ndoes it require to supply even a large family with _garden vegetables_?\r\nThe market gardeners round the metropolis of this wen-headed country;\r\nround this Wen of all wens;[8] round this prodigious and monstrous\r\ncollection of human beings; these market gardeners have about _three\r\nhundred thousand families to supply with vegetables_, and these they\r\nsupply well too, and with summer fruits into the bargain. Now, if it\r\ndemanded _ten rods to a family_, the whole would demand, all but a\r\nfraction, _nineteen thousand acres of garden ground_. We have only to cast\r\nour eyes over what there is to know that there is not a _fourth_ of that\r\nquantity. A _square mile_ contains, leaving out parts of a hundred, 700\r\nacres of land; and 19,000 acres occupy more than _twenty-two square\r\nmiles_. Are there twenty-two square miles covered with the Wen's market\r\ngardens? The very question is absurd. The whole of the market gardens from\r\nBrompton to Hammersmith, extending to Battersea Rise on the one side, and\r\nto the Bayswater road on the other side, and leaving out loads, lanes,\r\nnurseries; pastures, corn-fields, and pleasure-grounds, do not, in my\r\nopinion, cover _one square mile_. To the north and south of the Wen there\r\nis very little in the way of market garden; and if, on both sides of the\r\nThames, to the eastward of the Wen, there be _three square miles_ actually\r\ncovered with market gardens, that is the full extent. How, then, could the\r\nWen be supplied, if it required _ten rods_ to each family? To be sure,\r\npotatoes, carrots, and turnips, and especially the first of these, are\r\nbrought, for the use of the Wen, from a great distance, in many cases.\r\nBut, so they are for the use of the persons I am speaking of; for a\r\ngentleman thinks no more of raising a large quantity of these things in\r\nhis _garden_, than he thinks of _raising wheat there_. How is it, then,\r\nthat it requires half an acre, or eighty rods, in a _private_ garden to\r\nsupply a family, while these market gardeners supply all these families\r\n(and so amply too) from ten, or more likely, five rods of ground to a\r\nfamily? I have shown, in the last Number, that nearly fifteen tons of\r\nvegetables can be raised in a year upon forty rods of ground; that is to\r\nsay, _ten loads for a wagon and four good horses_. And is not a fourth, or\r\neven an eighth, part of this weight, sufficient to go down the throats of\r\na family in a year? Nay, allow that only _a ton_ goes to a family in a\r\nyear, it is more than _six pound weight a day_; and what sort of a family\r\nmust that be that really _swallows_ six pounds weight a day? and this a\r\nmarket gardener will raise for them upon less than _three rods_ of ground;\r\nfor he will raise, in the course of the year, even more than fifteen tons\r\nupon forty rods of ground. What is it, then, that they _do_ with the\r\neighty rods of ground in a private garden? Why, in the first place, they\r\nhave _one crop_ where they ought to have _three_. Then they do not half\r\n_till_ the ground. Then they grow things that are _not wanted_. Plant\r\ncabbages and other things, let them stand till they be good for nothing,\r\nand then wheel them to the rubbish heap. Raise as many radishes, lettuces,\r\nand as much endive, and as many kidney-beans, as would serve for ten\r\nfamilies; and finally throw nine-tenths of them away. I once saw not less\r\nthan three rods of ground, in a garden of this sort, with lettuces all\r\nbearing _seed_. Seed enough for half a county. They cut a cabbage _here_\r\nand a cabbage _there_, and so let the whole of the piece of ground remain\r\nundug, till the _last_ cabbage be cut. But, after all, the produce, even\r\nin this way, is so great, that it never could be gotten rid of, if the\r\nmain part were not _thrown away_. The rubbish heap always receives\r\nfour-fifths even of the _eatable_ part of the produce.\r\n\r\n138. It is not thus that the market gardeners proceed. Their rubbish heap\r\nconsists of little besides mere cabbage stumps. No sooner is one crop _on_\r\nthe ground than they settle in their minds what is to follow it. They\r\n_clear as they go_ in taking off a crop, and, as they clear they dig and\r\nplant. The ground is never without seed in it or plants on it. And thus,\r\nin the course of the year, they raise a prodigious bulk of vegetables from\r\neighty rods of ground. Such vigilance and industry are not to be expected\r\nin a _servant_; for it is foolish to expect that a man will exert himself\r\nfor another as much as he will for himself. But if I was situated as one\r\nof the persons is that I have spoken of in Paragraph 137; that is to say,\r\nif I had a garden of eighty rods, or even of sixty rods of ground, I would\r\nout of that garden, draw a sufficiency of vegetables for my family, and\r\nwould make it yield enough for a _cow_ besides. I should go a short way to\r\nwork with my gardener. I should put _Cottage Economy_ into his hands, and\r\ntell him, that if he could furnish me with vegetables, and my cow with\r\nfood, he was my man; and that if he could not, I must get one that could\r\nand would. I am not for making a man toil like a slave; but what would\r\nbecome of the world, if a well-fed healthy man could exhaust himself in\r\ntilling and cropping and clearing half an acre of ground? I have known\r\nmany men _dig_ thirty rods of garden ground in a day; I have, before I was\r\nfourteen, digged twenty rods in a day, for more than ten days\r\nsuccessively; and I have heard, and believe the fact, of a man at Portsea,\r\nwho digged forty rods in one single day, between daylight and dark. So\r\nthat it is no slavish toil that I am here recommending.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING PIGS.\r\n\r\n139. Next after the _Cow_ comes the _Pig_; and, in many cases, where a cow\r\ncannot be kept, a pig or pigs may be kept. But these are animals not to be\r\nventured on without due consideration as to the means of _feeding_ them;\r\nfor a starved pig is a great deal worse than none at all. You cannot make\r\nbacon as you can milk, merely out of the garden. There must be _something\r\nmore_. A couple of flitches of bacon are worth fifty thousand Methodist\r\nsermons and religious tracts. The sight of them upon the rack tends more\r\nto keep a man from poaching and stealing than whole volumes of penal\r\nstatutes, though assisted by the terrors of the hulks and the gibbet. They\r\nare great softeners of the temper, and promoters of domestic harmony. They\r\nare a great blessing; but they are not to be had from _herbage_ or _roots_\r\nof any kind; and, therefore, before a _pig_ be attempted, the means ought\r\nto be considered.\r\n\r\n140. _Breeding sows_ are great favourites with Cottagers in general; but I\r\nhave seldom known them to answer their purpose. Where there is an outlet,\r\nthe sow will, indeed, keep herself by grazing in summer, with a little\r\n_wash_ to help her out: and when her pigs come, they are many in number;\r\nbut they are a heavy expense. The sow must live as well as a _fatting\r\nhog_, or the pigs will be good for little. It is a great mistake, too, to\r\nsuppose that the condition of the sow _previous to pigging_ is of no\r\nconsequence; and, indeed, some suppose, that she ought to be rather _bare\r\nof flesh_ at the pigging time. Never was a greater mistake; for if she be\r\nin this state, she presently becomes a mere rack of bones; and then, do\r\nwhat you will, the pigs will be poor things. However fat she may be before\r\nshe farrow, the pigs will make her lean in a week. All her fat goes away\r\nin her milk, and unless the pigs have a _store_ to draw upon, they pull\r\nher down directly; and, by the time they are three weeks old, they are\r\nstarving for want; and then they never come to good.\r\n\r\n141. Now, a cottager's sow cannot, without great expense, be kept in a way\r\nto enable her to meet the demands of her farrow. She may _look_ pretty\r\nwell; but the flesh she has upon her is not of the same nature as that\r\nwhich the _farm-yard_ sow carries about her. It is the result of grass,\r\nand of poor grass, too, or other weak food; and not made partly out of\r\ncorn and whey and strong wash, as in the case of the farmer's sow. No food\r\nshort of that of a fatting hog will enable her to keep her pigs _alive_;\r\nand this she must have for _ten weeks_, and that at a great expense. Then\r\ncomes the operation, upon the principle of _Parson Malthus_, in order to\r\n_check population_; and there is some risk here, though not very great.\r\nBut there is the _weaning_; and who, that knows any thing about the\r\nmatter, will think lightly of the weaning of a farrow of pigs! By having\r\nnice food given them, they seem, for a few days, not to miss their mother.\r\nBut their appearance soon shows the want of her. Nothing but the very best\r\nfood, and that given in the most judicious manner, will keep them up to\r\nany thing like good condition; and, indeed, there is nothing short of\r\n_milk_ that will effect the thing well. How should it be otherwise? The\r\nvery richest cow's milk is poor, compared with that of the sow; and, to be\r\ntaken from this and put upon food, one ingredient of which is _water_, is\r\nquite sufficient to reduce the poor little things to bare bones and\r\nstaring hair, a state to which cottagers' pigs very soon come in general;\r\nand, at last, he frequently drives them to market, and sells them for less\r\nthan the cost of the food which they and the sow have devoured since they\r\nwere farrowed. It was, doubtless, pigs of this description that were sold\r\nthe other day at Newbury market, for _fifteen pence a piece_, and which\r\nwere, I dare say, dear even as a gift. To get such a pig to _begin_ to\r\ngrow will require _three months_, and with good feeding too in winter\r\ntime. To be sure it does come to be a hog at last; but, do what you can,\r\nit is a dear hog.\r\n\r\n142. The _Cottager_, then, can hold no competition with the _Farmer_ in\r\nthe _breeding_ of pigs, to do which, with advantage, there must be _milk_,\r\nand milk, too, that can be advantageously applied to no other use. The\r\ncottager's pig must be bought ready weaned to his hand, and, indeed, at\r\n_four months old_, at which age, if he be in good condition, he will eat\r\nany-thing that an old hog will eat. He will graze, eat cabbage leaves, and\r\nalmost the stumps. Swedish turnip tops or roots, and such things, with a\r\nlittle wash, will keep him along in very good growing order. I have now to\r\nspeak of the time of purchasing, the manner of keeping, of fatting,\r\nkilling, and curing; but these I must reserve till my next Number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\nKEEPING PIGS--(_continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n143. As in the case of cows so in that of pigs, much must depend upon the\r\nsituation of the cottage; because all pigs will _graze_; and therefore, on\r\nthe skirts of forests or commons, a couple or three pigs may be kept, if\r\nthe family be considerable; and especially if the cottager brew his own\r\nbeer, which will give him grains to assist the wash. Even in _lanes_, or\r\non the sides of great roads, a pig will find a good part of his food from\r\nMay to November; and if he be _yoked_, the occupiers of the neighbourhood\r\nmust be churlish and brutish indeed, if they give the owner any annoyance.\r\n\r\n144. Let me break off here for a moment to point out to my readers the\r\ntruly excellent conduct of Lord WINCHILSEA and Lord STANHOPE, who, as I\r\nread, have taken great pains to make the labourers on their estates\r\ncomfortable, by allotting to each a piece of ground sufficient for the\r\nkeeping of a cow. I once, when I lived at Botley, proposed to the\r\ncopyholders and other farmers in my neighbourhood, that we should petition\r\nthe Bishop of Winchester, who was lord of the manors thereabouts, to grant\r\ntitles to all the numerous persons called _trespassers on the wastes_; and\r\nalso to give titles to others of the poor parishioners, who were willing\r\nto make, on the skirts of the wastes, enclosures not exceeding an acre\r\neach. This I am convinced, would have done a great deal towards relieving\r\nthe parishes, then greatly burdened by men out of work. This would have\r\nbeen better than digging holes one day to fill them up the next. Not a\r\nsingle man would agree to my proposal! One, a bullfrog farmer (now, I\r\nhear, pretty well sweated down,) said it would only make them _saucy_! And\r\none, a true disciple of _Malthus_, said, that to facilitate their rearing\r\nof children _was a harm_! This man had, at the time, in his own\r\noccupation, land that had formerly been _six farms_, and he had, too, ten\r\nor a dozen children. I will not mention names; but this farmer will _now_,\r\nperhaps, have occasion to call to mind what I told him on that day, when\r\nhis opposition, and particularly the ground of it, gave me the more pain,\r\nas he was a very industrious, civil, and honest man. Never was there a\r\ngreater mistake than to suppose that men are made saucy and idle by just\r\nand kind treatment. _Slaves_ are always lazy and saucy; nothing but the\r\nlash will extort from them either labour or respectful deportment. I never\r\nmet with a _saucy_ Yankee (New Englander) in my life. Never servile;\r\nalways civil. This must necessarily be the character of _freemen living in\r\na state of competence_. They have nobody to envy; nobody to complain of;\r\nthey are in good humour with mankind. It must, however, be confessed, that\r\nvery little, comparatively speaking, is to be accomplished by the\r\nindividual efforts even of benevolent men like the two noblemen before\r\nmentioned. They have a strife to maintain against the _general tendency of\r\nthe national state of things_. It is by general and indirect means, and\r\nnot by partial and direct and positive regulations, that so great a good\r\nas that which they generously aim at can be accomplished. When we are to\r\nsee such means adopted, God only knows; but, if much longer delayed, I am\r\nof opinion, that they will come too late to prevent something very much\r\nresembling a dissolution of society.\r\n\r\n145. The cottager's pig should be bought in the spring, or late in winter;\r\nand being then four months old, he will be a year old before killing time;\r\nfor it should always be borne in mind, that this age is required in order\r\nto insure the greatest quantity of meat from a given quantity of food. If\r\na hog be more than a year old, he is the better for it. The flesh is more\r\nsolid and more nutritious than that of a young hog, much in the same\r\ndegree that the mutton of a full-mouthed wether is better than that of a\r\nyounger wether. The pork or bacon of young hogs, even if fatted on corn,\r\nis very apt to _boil out_, as they call it; that is to say, come out of\r\nthe pot smaller in bulk than it goes in. When you begin to fat, do it by\r\ndegrees, especially in the case of hogs under a year old. If you feed\r\n_high_ all at once, the hog is apt to _surfeit_, and then a great loss of\r\nfood takes place. Peas, or barley-meal is the food; the latter rather the\r\nbest, and does the work quicker. Make him _quite fat_ by all means. The\r\nlast bushel, even if he sit as he eat, is the most profitable. If he can\r\nwalk two hundred yards at a time, he is not well fatted. Lean bacon is the\r\nmost wasteful thing that any family can use. In short, it is uneatable,\r\nexcept by drunkards, who want something to stimulate their sickly\r\nappetite. The man who cannot live on _solid fat_ bacon, well-fed and\r\nwell-cured, wants the sweet sauce of labour, or is fit for the hospital.\r\nBut, then, it must be _bacon_, the effect of barley or peas, (not beans,)\r\nand not of whey, potatoes, or _messes_ of any kind. It is frequently said,\r\nand I know that even farmers say it, that bacon, made from corn, _costs\r\nmore than it is worth_! Why do they take care to have it then? They know\r\nbetter. They know well, that it is the very _cheapest_ they can have; and\r\nthey, who look at both ends and both sides of every cost, would as soon\r\nthink of shooting their hogs as of fatting them on _messes_; that is to\r\nsay, for _their own use_, however willing they might now-and-then be to\r\nregale the Londoners with a bit of potato-pork.\r\n\r\n146. About _Christmas_, if the weather be coldish, is a good time to kill.\r\nIf the weather be very mild, you may wait a little longer; for the hog\r\ncannot be too fat. The day before killing he should have no food. To kill\r\na hog nicely is so much of a profession, that it is better to pay a\r\nshilling for having it done, than to stab and hack and tear the carcass\r\nabout. I shall not speak of _pork_; for I would by no means recommend it.\r\nThere are two ways of going to work to make bacon; in the one you take off\r\nthe hair by _scalding_. This is the practice in most parts of England, and\r\nall over America. But the _Hampshire_ way, and the best way, is to _burn\r\nthe hair off_. There is a great deal of difference in the consequences.\r\nThe first method slackens the skin, opens all the pores of it, makes it\r\nloose and flabby by drawing out the roots of the hair. The second tightens\r\nthe skin in every part, contracts all the sinews and veins in the skin,\r\nmakes the flitch a solider thing, and the skin a better protection to the\r\nmeat. The taste of the meat is very different from that of a scalded hog;\r\nand to this chiefly it was that Hampshire bacon owed its reputation for\r\nexcellence. As the hair is to be _burnt_ off it must be _dry_, and care\r\nmust be taken, that the hog be kept on dry litter of some sort the day\r\nprevious to killing. When killed he is laid upon a narrow bed of straw,\r\nnot wider than his carcass, and only two or three inches thick. He is then\r\ncovered all over thinly with straw, to which, according as the wind may\r\nbe, the fire is put at one end. As the straw burns, it burns the hair. It\r\nrequires two or three coverings and burnings, and care is taken, that the\r\nskin be not in any part burnt, or parched. When the hair is all burnt off\r\nclose, the hog is _scraped_ clean, but never touched with _water_. The\r\nupper side being finished, the hog is turned over, and the other side is\r\ntreated in like manner. This work should always be done _before\r\nday-light_; for in the day-light you cannot so nicely discover whether the\r\nhair be sufficiently burnt off. The light of the fire is weakened by that\r\nof the day. Besides, it makes the boys get up very early for once at any\r\nrate, and that is something; for boys always like a bonfire.\r\n\r\n147. The _inwards_ are next taken out, and if the wife be not a slattern,\r\nhere, in the mere offal, in the mere garbage, there is food, and delicate\r\nfood too, for a large family for a week; and hog's puddings for the\r\nchildren, and some for neighbours' children, who come to play with them;\r\nfor these things are by no means to be overlooked, seeing that they tend\r\nto the keeping alive of that affection in children for their parents,\r\nwhich, later in life, will be found absolutely necessary to give effect to\r\nwholesome precept, especially when opposed to the boisterous passions of\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n148. The butcher, the next day, cuts the hog up; and then the house is\r\n_filled with meat_! Souse, griskins, blade-bones, thigh-bones, spare-ribs,\r\nchines, belly-pieces, cheeks, all coming into use one after the other, and\r\nthe last of the latter not before the end of about four or five weeks. But\r\nabout this time, it is more than possible that the Methodist parson will\r\npay you a visit. It is remarked in America, that these gentry are\r\nattracted by the squeaking of the pigs, as the fox is by the cackling of\r\nthe hen. This may be called slander; but I will tell you what I did know\r\nto happen. A good honest careful fellow had a spare-rib, on which he\r\nintended to sup with his family after a long and hard day's work at\r\ncoppice-cutting. Home he came at dark with his two little boys, each with\r\na nitch of wood that they had carried four miles, cheered with the thought\r\nof the repast that awaited them. In he went, found his wife, the Methodist\r\nparson, and a whole troop of the sisterhood, engaged in prayer, and on the\r\ntable lay scattered the clean-polished bones of the spare-rib! Can any\r\nreasonable creature believe, that, to save the soul, God requires us to\r\ngive up the food necessary to sustain the body? Did Saint Paul preach\r\nthis? He, who, while he spread the gospel abroad, _worked himself_, in\r\norder to have it to give to those who were unable to work? Upon what,\r\nthen, do these modern saints; these evangelical gentlemen, found their\r\nclaim to live on the labour of others.\r\n\r\n149. All the other parts taken away, the two sides that remain, and that\r\nare called _flitches_, are to be cured for _bacon_. They are first rubbed\r\nwith salt on their insides, or flesh sides, then placed, one on the other,\r\nthe flesh sides uppermost, in a salting trough which has a gutter round\r\nits edges to drain away the _brine_; for, to have sweet and fine bacon,\r\nthe flitches must not lie sopping in brine; which gives it that sort of\r\ntaste which barrel-pork and sea-jonk have, and than which nothing is more\r\nvillanous. Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh, dry salt,\r\nfrom that of salt in a dissolved state. The one is savoury, the other\r\nnauseous. Therefore, _change the salt often_. Once in four or five days.\r\nLet it melt, and sink in; but let it not lie too long. Change the\r\nflitches. Put that at bottom which was first put on the top. Do this a\r\ncouple of times. This mode will cost you a great deal more in salt, or\r\nrather in _taxes_, than the _sopping mode_; but without it, your bacon\r\nwill not be sweet and fine, and _will not keep so well_. As to the _time_\r\nrequired for making the flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on\r\ncircumstances; the thickness of the flitch, the state of the weather, the\r\nplace wherein the salting is going on. It takes a longer time for a thick\r\nthan for a thin flitch; it takes longer in dry, than in damp weather; it\r\ntakes longer in a dry than in a damp place. But for the flitches of a hog\r\nof twelve score, in weather not very dry or very damp, about six weeks may\r\ndo; and as yours is to be _fat_, which receives little injury from\r\nover-salting, give time enough; for you are to have bacon till Christmas\r\ncomes again. The place for salting should, like a dairy, always be cool,\r\nbut always admit of a _free circulation of air_: _confined_ air, though\r\n_cool_, will taint meat sooner than the mid-day sun accompanied with a\r\nbreeze. Ice will not melt in the hottest sun so soon as in a close and\r\ndamp cellar. Put a lump of ice in _cold water_, and one of the same size\r\nbefore a _hot fire_, and the former will dissolve in half the time that\r\nthe latter will. Let me take this occasion of observing, that an ice-house\r\nshould never be _under ground_, or _under the shade of trees_. That the\r\nbed of it ought to be three feet above the level of the ground; that this\r\nbed ought to consist of something that will admit the drippings to go\r\ninstantly off; and that the house should stand in a place _open to the sun\r\nand air_. This is the way they have the ice-houses under the burning sun\r\nof Virginia; and here they keep their fish and meat as fresh and sweet as\r\nin winter, when at the same time neither will keep for twelve hours,\r\nthough let down to the depth of a hundred feet in a well. A Virginian,\r\nwith some poles and straw, will stick up an ice-house for ten dollars,\r\nworth a dozen of those ice-houses, each of which costs our men of taste as\r\nmany scores of pounds. It is very hard to imagine, indeed, what any one\r\nshould want ice _for_, in a country like this, except for clodpole boys to\r\nslide upon, and to drown cockneys in skaiting-time; but if people must\r\nhave ice in summer, they may as well go a right way as a wrong way to get\r\nit.\r\n\r\n150. However, the patient that I have at this time under my hands wants\r\nnothing to cool his blood, but something to warm it, and, therefore, I\r\nwill get back to the flitches of bacon, which are now to be _smoked_; for\r\nsmoking is a great deal better than merely _drying_, as is the fashion in\r\nthe dairy countries in the West of England. When there were plenty of\r\n_farm_-houses there were plenty of places to smoke bacon in; since farmers\r\nhave lived in gentleman's houses, and the main part of the farm-houses\r\nhave been knocked down, these places are not so plenty. However, there is\r\nscarcely any neighbourhood without a chimney left to hang bacon up in. Two\r\nprecautions are necessary: first, to hang the flitches where no _rain_\r\ncomes down upon them: second, not to let them be so near the fire as to\r\n_melt_. These precautions taken, the next is, that the smoke must proceed\r\nfrom _wood_, not turf, peat, or coal. Stubble or litter might do; but the\r\ntrouble would be great. _Fir_, or _deal_, smoke is not fit for the\r\npurpose. I take it, that the absence of wood, as fuel, in the dairy\r\ncountries, and in the North, has led to the making of pork and dried\r\nbacon. As to the _time_ that it requires to smoke a flitch, it must depend\r\na good deal upon whether there be a _constant fire beneath_, and whether\r\nthe fire be large or small. A month may do, if the fire be pretty\r\nconstant, and such as a farm-house fire usually is. But over smoking, or,\r\nrather, too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon _rust_. Great\r\nattention should, therefore, be paid to this matter. The flitch ought not\r\nbe dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly\r\ndry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh-side\r\npretty thickly over with bran, or with some fine saw-dust other than that\r\nof deal or fir. Rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it. This\r\nkeeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a sort of\r\ncrust to be dried on; and, in short, keeps the flesh cleaner than it would\r\notherwise be.\r\n\r\n151. To keep the bacon sweet and good, and free from nasty things that\r\nthey call _hoppers_; that is to say, a sort of skipping maggots,\r\nengendered by a fly which has a great relish for bacon: to provide against\r\nthis mischief, and also to keep the bacon from becoming rusty, the\r\nAmericans, whose country is so hot in summer, have two methods. They smoke\r\nno part of the hog except the hams, or gammons. They cover these with\r\ncoarse linen cloth such as the finest hop-bags are made of, which they sew\r\nneatly on. They then _white-wash_ the cloth all over with _lime_\r\nwhite-wash, such as we put on walls, their lime being excellent\r\nstone-lime. They give the ham four or five washings, the one succeeding as\r\nthe former gets dry; and in the sun, all these washings are put on in a\r\nfew hours. The flies cannot get through this; and thus the meat is\r\npreserved from them. The _other_ mode, and that is the mode for you, is,\r\nto sift _fine_ some clean and dry _wood-ashes_. Put some at the bottom of\r\na box, or chest, which is long enough to hold a flitch of bacon. Lay in\r\none flitch; then put in more ashes; then the _other flitch_; and then\r\ncover this with six or eight inches of the ashes. This will effectually\r\nkeep away all flies; and will keep the bacon as fresh and good as when it\r\ncame out of the chimney, which it will not be for any great length of\r\ntime, if put on a rack, or kept hung up in the open air. _Dust_, or even\r\n_sand_, very, very _dry_, would, perhaps, do as well. The object is not\r\nonly to keep out the flies, but the _air_. The place where the chest, or\r\nbox, is kept, ought to be _dry_; and, if the ashes should get damp (as\r\nthey are apt to do from the salts they contain,) they should be put in the\r\nfire-place to dry, and then be put back again. Peat-ashes, or turf-ashes,\r\nmight do very well for this purpose. With these precautions, the bacon\r\nwill be as good at the end of the year as on the first day; and it will\r\nkeep two, and even three years, perfectly good, for which, however, there\r\ncan be no necessity.\r\n\r\n152. Now, then, this hog is altogether a capital thing. The other parts\r\nwill be meat for about four or five weeks. The _lard_, nicely put down,\r\nwill last a long while for all the purposes for which it is wanted. To\r\nmake it keep well there should be some salt put into it. Country children\r\nare badly brought up if they do not like sweet lard spread upon bread, as\r\nwe spread butter. Many a score hunches of this sort have I eaten, and I\r\nnever knew what poverty was. I have eaten it for luncheon at the houses of\r\ngood substantial farmers in France and Flanders. I am not now frequently\r\nso hungry as I ought to be; but I should think it no hardship to eat\r\n_sweet_ lard instead of butter. But, now-a-days, the labourers, and\r\nespecially the female part of them, have fallen into the taste of\r\n_niceness_ in food and _finery in dress_; a quarter of a bellyful and rags\r\nare the consequence. The food of their choice is high-priced, so that, for\r\nthe greater part of their time, they are half-starved. The dress of their\r\nchoice is _showy_ and _flimsy_, so that, to-day, they are _ladies_, and\r\nto-morrow ragged as sheep with the scab. But has not Nature made the\r\ncountry girls as pretty as ladies? Oh, yes! (bless their rosy cheeks and\r\nwhite teeth!) and a great deal prettier too! But are they _less_ pretty,\r\nwhen their dress is plain and substantial, and when the natural\r\npresumption is, that they have smocks as well as gowns, than they are when\r\ndrawn off in the frail fabric of Sir Robert Peel,[9] \"where tawdry colours\r\nstrive with dirty white,\" exciting violent suspicions that all is not as\r\nit ought to be nearer the skin, and calling up a train of ideas extremely\r\nhostile to that sort of feeling which every lass innocently and\r\ncommendably wishes to awaken in her male beholders? Are they prettiest\r\nwhen they come through the wet and dirt safe and neat; or when their\r\ndraggled dress is plastered to their backs by a shower of rain? However,\r\nthe fault has not been theirs, nor that of their parents. It is _the\r\nsystem_ of managing the affairs of the nation. This system has made all\r\n_flashy_ and _false_, and has put all things out of their place.\r\nPomposity, bombast, hyperbole, redundancy, and obscurity, both in speaking\r\nand in writing; mock-delicacy in manners; mock-liberality, mock-humanity,\r\nand mock-religion. Pitt's false money, Peel's flimsy dresses,\r\nWilberforce's potatoe diet, Castlereagh's and Mackintosh's oratory, Walter\r\nScott's poems, Walter's and Stoddart's[10] paragraphs, with all the bad\r\ntaste and baseness and hypocrisy which they spread over this country; all\r\nhave arisen, grown, branched out, bloomed, and borne together; and we are\r\nnow beginning to taste of their fruit. But, as the fat of the adder is, as\r\nis said, the antidote to its sting; so in the Son of the great worker of\r\nSpinning-Jennies, we have, thanks to the Proctors and Doctors of Oxford,\r\nthe author of that _Bill_, before which this false, this flashy, this\r\nflimsy, this rotten system will dissolve as one of his father's pasted\r\ncalicoes does at the sight of the washing-tub.\r\n\r\n153. \"What,\" says the cottager, \"has all this to do with hogs and bacon?\"\r\nNot directly with hogs and bacon, indeed; but it has a great deal to do,\r\nmy good fellow with your affairs, as I shall, probably, hereafter more\r\nfully show, though I shall now leave you to the enjoyment of your flitches\r\nof bacon, which, as I before observed, will do ten thousand times more\r\nthan any Methodist parson, or any other parson (except, of course, those\r\nof _our_ church) to make you happy, not only in this world, but in the\r\nworld to come. _Meat in the house_ is a great source of _harmony_, a great\r\npreventer of the temptation to commit those things, which, from small\r\nbeginnings, lead, finally, to the most fatal and atrocious results; and I\r\nhold that doctrine to be _truly damnable_, which teaches that God has made\r\nany selection, any condition relative to belief, which is to save from\r\npunishment those who violate the principles of _natural justice_.\r\n\r\n154. _Some_ other meat you may have; but, bacon is the great thing. It is\r\nalways ready; as good cold as hot; goes to the field or the coppice\r\nconveniently; in harvest, and other busy times, demands the pot to be\r\nboiled only on a Sunday; has twice as much strength in it as any other\r\nthing of the same weight; and in short, has in it every quality that tends\r\nto make a labourer's family able to work and well off. One pound of bacon,\r\nsuch as that which I have described, is, in a labourer's family, worth\r\nfour or five of ordinary mutton or beef, which are great part _bone_, and\r\nwhich, in short, are gone in a moment. But always observe, it is _fat\r\nbacon_ that I am talking about. There will, in spite of all that can be\r\ndone, be _some_ lean in the gammons, though comparatively very little; and\r\ntherefore you ought to begin at that end of the flitches; for, _old lean\r\nbacon_ is not good.\r\n\r\n155. Now, as to the _cost_. A pig (a _spayed sow_ is best) bought in March\r\nfour months old, can be had now for fifteen shillings. The cost till\r\nfatting time is next to nothing to a Cottager; and then the cost, at the\r\npresent price of corn, would, for a hog of twelve score, not exceed _three\r\npounds_; in the whole _four pounds five_; a pot of poison a week bought at\r\nthe public-house comes to _twenty-six shillings_ of the money; and more\r\nthan _three times the remainder_ is generally flung away upon the\r\nmiserable _tea_, as I have clearly shown in the First Number, at Paragraph\r\n24. I have, indeed, there shown, that if the tea were laid aside, the\r\nlabourer might supply his family well with beer all the year round, and\r\nhave a fat hog of even _fifteen score_ for the _cost of the tea_, which\r\ndoes him and can do him _no good at all_.\r\n\r\n156. The feet, the cheeks, and other bone, being considered, the _bacon\r\nand lard_, taken together, would not exceed _sixpence a pound_. Irish\r\nbacon is \"_cheaper_.\" Yes, _lower-priced_. But, I will engage that a pound\r\nof mine, when it comes _out_ of the pot (to say nothing of the _taste_,)\r\nshall weigh as much as a _pound and a half_ of Irish, or any dairy or\r\nslop-fed bacon, when that comes out of the pot. No, no: the farmers joke\r\nwhen they say, that their bacon _costs them more than_ they could buy\r\nbacon for. They know well what it is they are doing; and besides, they\r\nalways forget, or, rather, remember not to say, that the fatting of a\r\nlarge hog yields them three or four load of dung, really worth more than\r\nten or fifteen of common yard dung. In short, without hogs, farming _could\r\nnot go on_; and it never has gone on in any country in the world. The hogs\r\nare the great _stay_ of the whole concern. They are _much in small space_;\r\nthey make no _show_, as flocks and herds do; but with out them, the\r\ncultivation of the land would be a poor, a miserably barren concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTING MUTTON AND BEEF.\r\n\r\n157. _VERY FAT_ Mutton may be salted to great advantage, and also smoked,\r\nand may be kept thus a long while. Not the shoulders and legs, but the\r\n_back_ of the sheep. I have never made any flitch of _sheep-bacon_; but I\r\nwill; for there is nothing like having a _store_ of meat in a house. The\r\nrunning to the butchers daily is a ridiculous thing. The very idea of\r\nbeing fed, of a _family_ being fed, by daily supplies, has something in it\r\nperfectly _tormenting_. One half of the time of a mistress of a house,\r\nthe affairs of which are carried on in this way, is taken up in talking\r\nabout what is to be got for dinner, and in negotiations with the butcher.\r\nOne single moment spent at table beyond what is absolutely necessary, is a\r\nmoment very shamefully spent; but, to suffer a system of domestic economy,\r\nwhich unnecessarily wastes daily an hour or two of the mistress's time in\r\nhunting for the provision for the repast, is a shame indeed; and when we\r\nconsider how much time is generally spent in this and in equally absurd\r\nways, it is no wonder that we see so little performed by numerous\r\nindividuals as they do perform during the course of their lives.\r\n\r\n158. _Very fat parts of Beef_ may be salted and smoked in a like manner.\r\nNot the _lean_; for that is a great waste, and is, in short, good for\r\nnothing. Poor fellows on board of ships are compelled to eat it, but it is\r\na very bad thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\nBEES, FOWLS, &C. &C.\r\n\r\n\r\n159. I now proceed to treat of objects of less importance than the\r\nforegoing, but still such as may be worthy of great attention. If all of\r\nthem cannot be expected to come within the scope of a labourer's family,\r\nsome of them must, and others may: and it is always of great consequence,\r\nthat children be brought up to set a just value upon all useful things,\r\nand especially upon all _living things_; to know the _utility_ of them:\r\nfor, without this, they never, when grown up, are worthy of being\r\nentrusted with the _care_ of them. One of the greatest, and, perhaps, the\r\nvery commonest, fault of servants, is their inadequate care of animals\r\ncommitted to their charge. It is a well-known saying that \"the _master's\r\neye_ makes the horse fat,\" and the remissness to which this alludes, is\r\ngenerally owing to the servant not having been brought up to feel _an\r\ninterest_ in the well-being of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES.\r\n\r\n160. It is not my intention to enter into a history of this insect about\r\nwhich so much has been written, especially by the French naturalists. It\r\nis the _useful_ that I shall treat of, and that is done in not many words.\r\nThe best _hives_ are those made of clean unblighted _rye-straw_. Boards\r\nare too cold in England. A swarm should always be put into a _new_ hive,\r\nand the sticks should be _new_ that are put into the hive for the bees to\r\nwork on; for, if the hive be old, it is not so _wholesome_, and a thousand\r\nto one but it contain the embryos of _moths_ and other insects injurious\r\nto bees. Over the hive itself there should be a cap of thatch, made also\r\nof clean rye straw; and it should not only be _new_ when first put on the\r\nhive; but a new one should be made to supply the place of the former one\r\nevery three or four months; for when the straw begins to get rotten, as it\r\nsoon does, insects breed in it, its smell is bad, and its effect on the\r\nbees is dangerous.\r\n\r\n161. The hive should be placed on a bench, the legs of which mice and rats\r\ncannot creep up. Tin round the legs is best. But even this will not keep\r\ndown _ants_, which are mortal enemies of bees. To keep these away, if you\r\nfind them infest the hive, take a green stick and twist it round in the\r\nshape of a ring to lay on the ground round the leg of the bench, and at a\r\nfew inches from it; and cover this stick with _tar_. This will keep away\r\nthe ants. If the ants come from one home, you may easily _trace them to\r\nit_; and when you have found it, pour _boiling water_ on it in the night,\r\nwhen all the family are at home.\r\n\r\nThis is the only effectual way of destroying ants, which are frequently so\r\ntroublesome. It would be cruel to cause this destruction, if it were not\r\nnecessary to do it, in order to preserve the honey, and indeed the bees\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n162. Besides the hive and its cap, there should be a sort of shed, with\r\ntop, back, and ends, to give additional protection in winter; though in\r\nsummer hives may be kept _too hot_, and in that case the bees become\r\nsickly and the produce becomes light. The _situation_ of the hive is to\r\nface the South-east; or, at any rate, to be sheltered from the _North_ and\r\nthe _West_. From the North always, and from the West in winter. If it be a\r\nvery dry season in summer, it contributes greatly to the success of the\r\nbees, to place clear water near their home, in a thing that they can\r\nconveniently drink out of; for if they have to go a great way for drink,\r\nthey have not much time for work.\r\n\r\n163. It is supposed that bees live only a year; at any rate it is best\r\nnever to keep the same stall, or family, over two years, except you want\r\nto increase your number of hives. The swarm of _this summer_ should always\r\nbe taken in the autumn of next year. It is whimsical to _save_ the bees\r\nwhen you take the honey. You must _feed_ them; and, if saved, they will\r\ndie of old age before the next fall; and though young ones will supply the\r\nplace of the dead, this is nothing like a good swarm put up during the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n164. As to the things that bees make their collections from, we do not,\r\nperhaps, know a thousandth part of them; but of all the blossoms that they\r\nseek eagerly that of the _Buck-wheat_ stands foremost. Go round a piece of\r\nthis grain just towards sunset, when the buck-wheat is in bloom, and you\r\nwill see the air filled with bees going home from it in all directions.\r\nThe buck-wheat, too, continues in bloom a long while; for the grain is\r\ndead ripe on one part of the plant, while there are fresh blossoms coming\r\nout on the other part.\r\n\r\n165. A good stall of bees, that is to say, the produce of one, is always\r\nworth about _two bushels of good wheat_. The _cost_ is nothing to the\r\nlabourer. He must be a stupid countryman indeed who cannot make a\r\nbee-hive; and a lazy one indeed if he _will_ not, if he can. In short,\r\nthere is nothing but _care_ demanded; and there are very few situations in\r\nthe country, especially in the south of England, where a labouring man may\r\nnot have half a dozen stalls of bees to take every year. The main things\r\nare to keep away insects, mice, and birds, and especially a little bird\r\ncalled the bee-bird; and to keep all clean and fresh as to the hives and\r\ncoverings. Never put a swarm into an _old hive_. If wasps, or hornets,\r\nannoy you, watch them home in the day time; and in the night kill them by\r\nfire, or by boiling water. Fowls should not go where bees are, for they\r\neat them.\r\n\r\n166. Suppose a man get three stalls of bees in a year. Six bushels of\r\nwheat give him bread for an _eighth part of the year_. Scarcely any thing\r\nis a greater misfortune than _shiftlessness_. It is an evil little short\r\nof the loss of eyes or of limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEESE.\r\n\r\n167. They can be kept to advantage only where there are _green commons_,\r\nand there they are easily kept; live to a very great age; and are amongst\r\nthe hardiest animals in the world. If _well kept_, a goose will lay a\r\nhundred eggs in a year. The French put their eggs under large hens of\r\ncommon fowls, to each of which they give four or five eggs; or under\r\nturkies, to which they give nine or ten goose-eggs. If the goose herself\r\nsit, she must be well and _regularly fed_, at, or near to, her nest. When\r\nthe young ones are hatched, they should be kept in a warm place for about\r\nfour days, and fed on barley-meal, mixed, if possible, with milk; and then\r\nthey will begin to _graze_. Water for them, or for the old ones to _swim_\r\nin, is by no means _necessary_, nor, perhaps, ever even _useful_. Or, how\r\nis it, that you see such fine flocks of fine geese all over Long Island\r\n(in America) where there is scarcely such a thing as a pond or a run of\r\nwater?\r\n\r\n168. Geese are raised by _grazing_; but to _fat_ them something more is\r\nrequired. Corn of some sort, or boiled Swedish turnips. Some corn and some\r\nraw Swedish turnips, or carrots, or white cabbages, or lettuces, make the\r\nbest fatting. The modes that are resorted to by the French for fatting\r\ngeese, _nailing_ them down by their webs, and other acts of cruelty, are,\r\nI hope, such as Englishmen will never think of. They will get fat enough\r\nwithout the use of any of these unfeeling means being employed. He who can\r\ndeliberately inflict _torture_ upon an animal, in order to heighten the\r\npleasure his palate is to receive in eating it, is an abuser of the\r\nauthority which God has given him, and is, indeed, a tyrant in his heart.\r\nWho would think himself safe, if at the _mercy_ of such a man? Since the\r\nfirst edition of this work was published, I have had a good deal of\r\nexperience with regard to geese. It is a very great error to suppose that\r\nwhat is called a Michaelmas goose is _the thing_. Geese are, in general,\r\neaten at the age when they are called green geese; or after they have got\r\ntheir full and entire growth, which is not until the latter part of\r\nOctober. Green geese are tasteless squabs; loose flabby things; no rich\r\ntaste in them; and, in short, a very indifferent sort of dish. The\r\nfull-grown goose has solidity in it; but it is _hard_, as well as solid;\r\nand in place of being _rich_, it is strong. Now, there is a middle course\r\nto take; and if you take this course, you produce the finest birds of\r\nwhich we can know any thing in England. For three years, including the\r\npresent year, I have had the finest geese that I ever saw, or ever heard\r\nof. I have bought from twenty to thirty every one of these years. I buy\r\nthem off the common late in June, or very early in July. They have cost me\r\nfrom two shillings to three shillings each, first purchase. I bring the\r\nflock home, and put them in a pen, about twenty feet square, where I keep\r\nthem well littered with straw, so as for them not to get filthy. They have\r\none trough in which I give them dry oats, and they have another trough\r\nwhere they have constantly plenty of clean water. Besides these, we give\r\nthem, two or three times a day, a parcel of lettuces out of the garden. We\r\ngive them such as are going to seed generally; but the better the lettuces\r\nare, the better the geese. If we have no lettuces to spare, we give them\r\ncabbages, either loaved or not loaved; though, observe, the white cabbage\r\nas well as the white lettuce, that is to say, the loaved cabbage and\r\nlettuce, are a great deal better than those that are not loaved. This is\r\nthe food of my geese. They thrive exceedingly upon this food. After we\r\nhave had the flock about ten days, we begin to kill, and we proceed once\r\nor twice a week till about the middle of October, sometimes later. A great\r\nnumber of persons who have eaten of these geese have all declared that\r\nthey did not imagine that a goose could be brought to be so good a bird.\r\nThese geese are altogether different from the hard, strong things that\r\ncome out of the stubble fields, and equally different from the flabby\r\nthings called a green goose. I should think that the cabbages or lettuces\r\nperform half the work of keeping and fatting my geese; and these are\r\nthings that really cost nothing. I should think that the geese, upon an\r\naverage, do not consume more than a shilling's worth of oats each. So that\r\nwe have these beautiful geese for about four shillings each. No money will\r\nbuy me such a goose in London; but the thing that I can get nearest to it,\r\nwill cost me _seven_ shillings. Every gentleman has a garden. That garden\r\nhas, in the month of July, a wagon-load, at least, of lettuces and\r\ncabbages to throw away. Nothing is attended with so little trouble as\r\nthese geese. There is hardly any body near London that has not room for\r\nthe purposes here mentioned. The reader will be apt to exclaim, as my\r\nfriends very often do, \"Cobbett's Geese are all _Swans_.\" Well, better\r\nthat way than not to be pleased with what one has. However, let gentlemen\r\ntry this method of fatting geese. It saves money, mind, at the same time.\r\nLet them try it; and if any one, who shall try it, shall find the effect\r\nnot to be that which I say it is, let him reproach me publicly with being\r\na deceiver. The thing is no _invention_ of mine. While I could buy a goose\r\noff the common for half-a-crown, I did not like to give seven shillings\r\nfor one in London, and yet I wished that geese should not be excluded from\r\nmy house. Therefore I bought a flock of geese, and brought them home to\r\nKensington. They could not be eaten all at once. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to fix upon a mode of feeding them. The above mode was adopted\r\nby my servant, as far as I know, without any knowledge of mine; but the\r\nvery agreeable result made me look into the matter; and my opinion, that\r\nthe information will be useful to many persons, at any rate, is sufficient\r\nto induce me to communicate it to my readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCKS.\r\n\r\n169. No water, to _swim_ in, is necessary to the old, and is _injurious_\r\nto the very young. They never should be suffered to swim (if water be\r\nnear) till _more than a month old_. The old duck will lay, in the year, if\r\n_well kept_, ten dozen of eggs; and that is her best employment; for\r\ncommon hens are the best mothers. It is not good to let young ducks out in\r\nthe morning to eat _slugs_ and _worms_; for, though they like them, these\r\nthings kill them if they eat a great quantity. Grass, corn, white\r\ncabbages, and lettuces, and especially buck-wheat, cut, when half ripe,\r\nand flung down in the haulm. This makes fine ducks. Ducks will feed on\r\ngarbage and all sorts of filthy things; but their flesh is _strong_, and\r\nbad in proportion. They are, in Long Island, fatted upon a coarse sort of\r\n_crab_, called a horse-foot fish, prodigious quantities of which are cast\r\non the shores. The young ducks grow very fast upon this, and very fat; but\r\nwo unto him that has to _smell_ them when they come from the spit; and, as\r\nfor _eating_ them, a man must have a stomach indeed to do that!\r\n\r\n170. When young, they should be fed upon barley-meal, or _curds_, and kept\r\nin a warm place in the night-time, and not let out _early_ in the morning.\r\nThey should, if possible, be kept from water to _swim_ in. It always does\r\nthem harm; and, if intended to be sold to be killed _young_, they should\r\nnever go near ponds, ditches, or streams. When you come to fat ducks, you\r\nmust take care that they get at _no filth_ whatever. They will eat garbage\r\nof all sorts; they will suck down the most nauseous particles of all those\r\nsubstances which go for manure. A dead rat three parts rotten is a feast\r\nto them. For these reasons I should never eat any ducks, unless there were\r\nsome mode of keeping them from this horrible food. I treat them precisely\r\nas I do my geese. I buy a troop when they are young, and put them in a\r\npen, and feed them upon oats, cabbages, lettuces, and water, and have the\r\nplace kept very clean. My ducks are, in consequence of this, a great deal\r\nmore fine and delicate than any others that I know any-thing of.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEYS.\r\n\r\n171. These are _flying_ things, and so are _common fowls_. But it may\r\nhappen that a few hints respecting them may be of use. To raise turkeys in\r\nthis chilly climate, is a matter of much greater difficulty than in the\r\nclimates that give great warmth. But the great enemy to young turkeys (for\r\nold ones are hardy enough) _is the wet_. This they will endure in _no\r\nclimate_; and so true is this, that, in America, where there is always \"_a\r\nwet spell_\" in April, the farmers' wives take care never to have a brood\r\ncome out until that spell is passed. In England, where the wet spells come\r\nat haphazard, the first thing is to take care that young turkeys never go\r\nout, on any account, except in dry weather, till the _dew be quite off the\r\nground_; and this should be adhered to till they get to be of the size of\r\nan old partridge, and have their backs well covered with feathers. And, in\r\nwet weather, they should be kept under cover all day long.\r\n\r\n172. As to the _feeding_ of them, when young, various nice things are\r\nrecommended. Hard eggs chopped fine, with crumbs of bread, and a great\r\nmany other things; but that which I have seen used, and always with\r\nsuccess, and for all sorts of young poultry, is milk _turned into curds_.\r\nThis is the food for young poultry of all sorts. Some should be made\r\n_fresh every_ day; and if this be done, and the young turkeys kept warm,\r\nand especially _from wet_, not one out of a score will die. When they get\r\nto be strong, they may have meal and grain, but still they always love\r\nthe curds.\r\n\r\n173. When they get their _head feathers_ they are hardy enough; and what\r\nthey then want is _room_ to prowl about. It is best to breed them under a\r\n_common hen_; because she does not _ramble_ like a hen-turkey; and it is a\r\nvery curious thing that the turkeys bred up by a hen of the common fowl,\r\n_do not themselves ramble much when they get old_; and for this reason,\r\nwhen they buy turkeys for _stock_, in America, (where there are such large\r\nwoods, and where the distant rambling of turkeys is inconvenient,) they\r\nalways buy such as have been bred under the hens of the common fowl; than\r\nwhich a more complete proof of the great powers of _habit_ is, perhaps,\r\nnot to be found. And ought not this to be a lesson to fathers and mothers\r\nof families? Ought not they to consider that the habits which they give\r\ntheir children are to stick by those children during their whole lives?\r\n\r\n174. The _hen_ should be fed _exceedingly well_, too, while she is\r\n_sitting_ and _after_ she has hatched; for though she does not give\r\n_milk_, she gives _heat_; and, let it be observed, that as no man ever yet\r\nsaw healthy pigs with a poor sow, so no man ever saw healthy chickens with\r\na poor hen. This is a matter much too little thought of in the rearing of\r\npoultry; but it is a matter of the greatest consequence. Never let a poor\r\nhen sit; feed the hen well while she is sitting, and feed her most\r\nabundantly when she has young ones; for then her _labour_ is very great;\r\nshe is making exertions of some sort or other during the whole twenty-four\r\nhours; she has no rest; is constantly doing something or other to provide\r\nfood or safety for her young ones.\r\n\r\n175. As to _fatting_ turkeys, the best way is, never to let them be poor.\r\n_Cramming_ is a nasty thing, and quite unnecessary. Barley-meal, mixed\r\nwith skim-milk, given to them, fresh and fresh, will make them fat in a\r\nshort time, either in a coop, in a house, or running about. Boiled carrots\r\nand Swedish turnips will help, and it is a change of sweet food. In\r\nFrance they sometimes _pick turkeys alive_, to make them _tender_; of\r\nwhich I shall only say, that the man that can do this, or order it to be\r\ndone, ought to be skinned alive himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLS.\r\n\r\n176. These are kept for two objects; their _flesh_ and their _eggs_. As to\r\n_rearing them_, every thing said about rearing turkeys is applicable here.\r\nThey are best _fatted_, too, in the same manner. But, as to _laying-hens_,\r\nthere are some means to be used to secure the use of them in _winter_.\r\nThey ought not to be _old hens_. Pullets, that is, birds hatched in the\r\nforegoing spring, are, perhaps, the best. At any rate, let them not be\r\nmore than _two years old_. They should be kept in a _warm_ place, and not\r\nlet out, even in the day-time, in _wet_ weather; for one good sound\r\nwetting will keep them back for a fortnight. The dry cold, even in the\r\nseverest cold, if _dry_, is less injurious than even a little _wet_ in\r\nwinter-time. If the feathers get wet, in our climate, in winter, or in\r\nshort days, they do not get dry for a long time; and this it is that\r\nspoils and kills many of our fowls.\r\n\r\n177. The French, who are great egg-eaters, take singular pains as to the\r\n_food_ of laying-hens in winter. They let them out very little, even in\r\ntheir fine climate, and give them very stimulating food; barley boiled,\r\nand given them warm; curds, _buck-wheat_, (which, I believe, is the best\r\nthing of all except curds;) parsley and other herbs chopped fine; leeks\r\nchopped in the same way; also apples and pears chopped very fine; oats and\r\nwheat cribbled; and sometimes they give them hemp-seed, and the seed of\r\nnettles; or dried nettles, harvested in summer, and boiled in the winter.\r\nSome give them ordinary food, and, once a day, toasted bread sopped in\r\nwine. White cabbages chopped up are very good in winter for all sorts of\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\n178. This is taking a great deal of pains; but the produce is also great\r\nand very valuable in winter; for, as to _preserved_ eggs, they are things\r\nto run _from_ and not after. All this supposes, however, a proper\r\n_hen-house_, about which we, in England, take very little pains. The\r\n_vermin_, that is to say, the _lice_, that poultry breed, are the greatest\r\nannoyance. And as our wet climate furnishes them, for a great part of the\r\nyear, with no _dust_ by which to get rid of these vermin, we should be\r\nvery careful about _cleanliness_ in the hen-houses. Many a hen, when\r\nsitting, is compelled to quit her nest to get rid of the lice. They\r\ntorment the young chickens. And, in short, are a great injury. The\r\nfowl-house should, therefore, be very often cleaned out; and sand, or\r\nfresh earth, should be thrown on the floor. The nest should not be on\r\n_shelves_, or on any-thing fixed; but little flat baskets, something like\r\nthose that the gardeners have in the markets in London, and which they\r\ncall _sieves_, should be placed against the sides of the house upon pieces\r\nof wood nailed up for the purpose. By this means the nests are kept\r\nperfectly clean, because the baskets are, when necessary, taken down, the\r\nhay thrown out, and the baskets washed; which cannot be done, if the nest\r\nbe made in any-thing forming a part of the building. Besides this, the\r\nroosts ought to be cleaned every week, and the hay changed in the nests of\r\nlaying-hens. It is good to _fumigate_ the house frequently by burning dry\r\nherbs, juniper wood, cedar wood, or with brimstone; for nothing stands so\r\nmuch in need of cleanliness as a fowl-house, in order to have fine fowls\r\nand plenty of eggs.\r\n\r\n179. The _ailments_ of fowls are numerous, but they would seldom be seen,\r\nif the proper care were taken. It is useless to talk of _remedies_ in a\r\ncase where you have complete power to prevent the evil. If well fed, and\r\nkept perfectly clean, fowls will seldom be sick; and, as to old age, they\r\nnever ought to be kept more than a couple or three years; for they get to\r\nbe good for little as layers, and no _teeth_ can face them as food.\r\n\r\n180. It is, perhaps, seldom that fowls can be kept conveniently about a\r\ncottage; but when they can, three, four, or half a dozen hens to lay in\r\n_winter_, when the wife is at _home_ the greater part of the time, are\r\nworth attention. They would require but little room, might be bought in\r\nNovember and sold in April, and six of them, with proper care, might be\r\nmade to clear every week the price of a gallon of flour. If the labour\r\nwere great, I should not think of it; but it is _none_; and I am for\r\nneglecting nothing in the way of pains in order to ensure a hot dinner\r\nevery day in winter, when the man comes home from work. As to the\r\n_fatting_ of fowls, information can be of no use to those who live in a\r\ncottage all their lives; but it may be of some use to those who are born\r\nin cottages, and go to have the care of poultry at richer persons' houses.\r\nFowls should be put to fat about a fortnight before they are wanted to be\r\nkilled. The best food is barley-meal wetted with milk, but not wetted too\r\nmuch. They should have clear water to drink, and it should be frequently\r\nchanged. Crammed fowls are very nasty things: but \"_barn-door_\" fowls, as\r\nthey are called, are sometimes a great deal more nasty. _Barn_-door would,\r\nindeed, do exceedingly well; but it unfortunately happens that the\r\n_stable_ is generally pretty near to the barn. And now let any gentleman\r\nwho talks about sweet barn-door fowls, have one caught in the yard, where\r\nthe stable is also. Let him have it brought in, killed, and the craw taken\r\nout and cut open. Then let him take a ball of horse-dung from the\r\nstable-door; and let his nose tell him how very small is the difference\r\nbetween the smell of the horse-dung, and the smell of the craw of his\r\nfowl. In short, roast the fowl, and then pull aside the skin at the neck,\r\nput your nose to the place, and you will almost think that you are at the\r\nstable door. Hence the necessity of taking them away from the barn-door a\r\nfortnight, at least, before they are killed. We know very well that ducks\r\nthat have been fed upon fish, either wild ducks, or tame ducks, will scent\r\na whole room, and drive out of it all those who have not pretty good\r\nconstitutions. It must be so. Solomon says that all flesh is grass; and\r\nthose who know any-thing about beef, know the difference between the\r\neffect of the grass in Herefordshire and Lincolnshire, and the effect of\r\nturnips and oil cake. In America they always take the fowls from the\r\nfarm-yard, and shut them up a fortnight or three weeks before they be\r\nkilled. One thing, however, about fowls ought always to be borne in mind.\r\nThey are never good for any-thing when they have attained their full\r\ngrowth, unless they be _capons_ or _poullards_. If the poulets be old\r\nenough to have little eggs in them, they are not worth one farthing; and\r\nas to the cocks of the same age, they are fit for nothing but to make soup\r\nfor soldiers on their march, and they ought to be taken for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGEONS.\r\n\r\n181. A few of these may be kept about any cottage, for they are kept even\r\nin towns by labourers and artizans. They cause but little trouble. They\r\ntake care of their own young ones; and they do not scratch, or do any\r\nother mischief in gardens. They want feeding with tares, peas, or small\r\nbeans; and buck-wheat is very good for them. To _begin_ keeping them, they\r\nmust not have _flown at large_ before you get them. You must keep them for\r\ntwo or three days, shut into the place which is to be their home; and then\r\nthey may be let out, and will never leave you, as long as they can get\r\nproper food, and are undisturbed by vermin, or unannoyed exceedingly by\r\nlice.\r\n\r\n182. The common dove-house pigeons are the best to keep. They breed\r\noftenest, and feed their young ones best. They begin to breed at about\r\n_nine months old_, and if well kept, they will give you eight or nine pair\r\nin the year. Any little place, a shelf in the cow shed; a board or two\r\nunder the eaves of the house; or, in short, any place under cover, even on\r\nthe ground floor, they will sit and hatch and breed up their young ones\r\nin.\r\n\r\n183. It is not supposed that there could be much _profit_ attached to\r\nthem; but they are of this use; they are very pretty creatures; very\r\ninteresting in their manners; they are an object to delight _children_,\r\nand to give them the _early habit_ of fondness for animals and of\r\n_setting a value_ on them, which, as I have often had to observe before,\r\nis a very great thing. A considerable part of all the _property_ of a\r\nnation consists of animals. Of course a proportionate part of the cares\r\nand labours of a people appertain to the breeding and bringing to\r\nperfection those animals; and, if you consult your experience, you will\r\nfind that a labourer is, generally speaking, of value in proportion as he\r\nis worthy of being intrusted with the care of animals. The most careless\r\nfellow cannot _hurt_ a hedge or ditch; but to trust him with the _team_,\r\nor the _flock_, is another matter. And, mind, for the _man_ to be\r\ntrust-worthy in this respect, the _boy_ must have been in the _habit_ of\r\nbeing kind and considerate towards animals; and nothing is so likely to\r\ngive him that excellent habit as his seeing, from his very birth, animals\r\ntaken great care of, and treated with great kindness by his parents, and\r\nnow-and-then having a little thing to _call his own_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS.\r\n\r\n184. In this case, too, the chief use, perhaps, is to give children those\r\nhabits of which I have been just speaking. Nevertheless, rabbits are\r\nreally profitable. Three does and a buck will give you a rabbit to eat for\r\n_every three days in the year_, which is a much larger quantity of food\r\nthan any man will get by spending half his time in the pursuit of _wild_\r\nanimals, to say nothing of the toil, the tearing of clothes, and the\r\ndanger of pursuing the latter.\r\n\r\n185. Every-body knows how to knock up a rabbit hutch. The does should not\r\nbe allowed to have more than _seven litters_ in a year. Six young ones to\r\na doe is all that ought to be kept; and then they will be fine. _Abundant\r\nfood_ is the main thing; and what is there that a rabbit will _not eat_? I\r\nknow of nothing _green_ that they will not eat; and if hard pushed, they\r\nwill eat bark, and even wood. The best thing to feed the young ones on\r\nwhen taken from the mother, is the _carrot_, wild or garden. Parsnips,\r\nSwedish turnips, roots of dandelion; for too much green or _watery_ stuff\r\nis not good for _weaning_ rabbits. They should remain as long as possible\r\nwith the mother. They should have oats once a-day; and, after a time, they\r\nmay eat any-thing with safety. But if you give them too much _green_ at\r\nfirst when they are weaned, they _rot_ as sheep do. A _variety_ of food is\r\na great thing; and, surely, the fields and gardens and hedges furnish this\r\nvariety! All sorts of grasses, strawberry-leaves, ivy, dandelions, the\r\n_hog-weed_ or _wild parsnip_, in root, stem, and leaves. I have fed\r\nworking horses, six or eight in number, upon this plant for weeks\r\ntogether. It is a tall bold plant that grows in prodigious quantities in\r\nthe hedges and coppices in some parts of England. It is the _perennial\r\nparsnip_. It has flower and seed precisely like those of the parsnip; and\r\nhogs, cows, and horses, are equally fond of it. Many a half-starved pig\r\nhave I seen within a few yards of cart-loads of this pig-meat! This arises\r\nfrom want of the early habit of attention to such matters. I, who used to\r\nget hog-weed for pigs and for rabbits when a little chap, have never\r\nforgotten that the wild parsnip is good food for pigs and rabbits.\r\n\r\n186. When the doe has young ones, feed her most abundantly with all sorts\r\nof greens and herbage and with carrots and the other things mentioned\r\nbefore, besides giving her a few oats once a-day. That is the way to have\r\nfine healthy young ones, which, if they come from the mother in good case,\r\nwill very seldom die. But do not think, that because she is a small\r\nanimal, a little feeding is sufficient! Rabbits eat a great deal more than\r\ncows or sheep in proportion to their bulk.\r\n\r\n187. Of all animals rabbits are those that _boys_ are most fond of. They\r\nare extremely pretty, nimble in their movements, engaging in their\r\nattitudes, and always completely under immediate control. The produce has\r\nnot long to be waited for. In short, they keep an interest constantly\r\nalive in a little chap's mind; and they really _cost nothing_; for as to\r\nthe _oats_, where is the boy that cannot, in harvest-time, pick up enough\r\nalong the _lanes_ to serve his rabbits for a year? The _care_ is all; and\r\nthe habit of taking care of things is, of itself, a most valuable\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n188. To those gentlemen who keep rabbits for the use of their family (and\r\na very useful and convenient article they are,) I would observe, that when\r\nthey find their rabbits die, they may depend on it, that ninety-nine times\r\nout of the hundred _starvation_ is the malady. And particularly short\r\nfeeding of the doe, while, and before she has young ones; that is to say,\r\nshort feeding of her _at all times_; for, if she be poor, the young ones\r\nwill be good for nothing. She will _live_ being poor, but she will not,\r\nand cannot breed up fine young ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOATS AND EWES.\r\n\r\n189. In some places where a cow cannot be kept, a goat may. A\r\ncorrespondent points out to me, that a Dorset ewe or two might be kept on\r\na common near a cottage to give milk; and certainly this might be done\r\nvery well; but I should prefer a goat, which is hardier and much more\r\ndomestic. When I was in the army, in New Brunswick, where, be it observed,\r\nthe snow lies on the ground seven months in the year, there were many\r\ngoats that _belonged to the regiment_, and that went about with it on\r\nshipboard and every-where else. Some of them had gone through nearly the\r\nwhole of the _American War_. We _never fed_ them. In summer they picked\r\nabout wherever they could find grass; and in winter they lived on\r\ncabbage-leaves, turnip-peelings, potatoe-peelings, and other things flung\r\nout of the soldiers' rooms and huts. One of these goats belonged to me,\r\nand, on an average throughout the year, she gave me more than three\r\nhalf-pints of milk a day. I used to have the kid killed when a few days\r\nold; and, for some time, the goat would give nearly or quite, two quarts\r\nof milk a day. She was seldom dry more than three weeks in the year.\r\n\r\n190. There is one great inconvenience belonging to goats; that is, they\r\nbark all young trees that they come near; so that, if they get into a\r\n_garden_, they destroy every thing. But there are seldom trees on commons,\r\nexcept such as are too large to be injured by goats; and I can see no\r\nreason against keeping a goat where a cow cannot be kept. Nothing is so\r\nhardy; nothing is so little nice as to its food. Goats will pick peelings\r\nout of the kennel and eat them. They will eat mouldy bread or biscuit;\r\nfusty hay, and almost rotten straw; furze-bushes, heath-thistles; and,\r\nindeed, what will they not eat, when they will make a hearty meal on\r\n_paper_, brown or white, printed on or not printed on, and give milk all\r\nthe while! They will lie in any dog-hole. They do very well clogged, or\r\nstumped out. And, then, they are very _healthy_ things into the bargain,\r\nhowever closely they may be confined. When sea voyages are so stormy as to\r\nkill geese, ducks, fowls, and almost pigs, the goats are well and lively;\r\nand when a dog of no kind can keep the deck for a minute, a goat will skip\r\nabout upon it as bold as brass.\r\n\r\n191. Goats do not _ramble_ from home. They come in regularly in the\r\nevening, and if called, they come like dogs. Now, though ewes, when taken\r\ngreat care of, will be very gentle, and though their milk may be rather\r\nmore delicate than that of the goat, the ewes must be fed with nice and\r\nclean food, and they will not do much in the milk-giving way upon a\r\ncommon; and, as to _feeding them_, provision must be made pretty nearly as\r\nfor a cow. They will not endure _confinement_ like goats; and they are\r\nsubject to numerous ailments that goats know nothing of. Then the ewes are\r\ndone by the time they are about six years old; for they then lose their\r\nteeth; whereas a goat will continue to breed and to give milk in abundance\r\nfor a great many years. The sheep is _frightened_ at everything, and\r\nespecially at the least sound of a dog. A goat, on the contrary, will\r\n_face a dog_, and if he be not a big and courageous one, beat him off.\r\n\r\n192. I have often wondered how it happened that none of our labourers kept\r\ngoats; and I really should be glad to see the thing tried. They are\r\npretty creatures, domestic as a dog, will stand and watch, as a dog does,\r\nfor a crumb of bread, as you are eating; give you no trouble in the\r\nmilking; and I cannot help being of opinion, that it might be of great use\r\nto introduce them amongst our labourers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDLES AND RUSHES.\r\n\r\n193. We are not permitted to make candles ourselves, and if we were, they\r\nought seldom to be used in a labourer's family. I was bred and brought up\r\nmostly by _rush-light_, and I do not find that I see less clearly than\r\nother people. Candles certainly were not much used in English labourers'\r\ndwellings in the days when they had meat dinners and Sunday coats.\r\nPotatoes and taxed candles seem to have grown into fashion together; and,\r\nperhaps, for this reason: that when the pot ceased to afford _grease_ for\r\nthe rushes, the potatoe-gorger was compelled to go to the chandler's shop\r\nfor light to swallow the potatoes by, else he might have devoured peeling\r\nand all!\r\n\r\n194. My grandmother, who lived to be pretty nearly ninety, never, I\r\nbelieve, burnt a candle in her house in her life. I know that I never saw\r\none there, and she, in a great measure, brought me up. She used to get the\r\nmeadow-rushes, such as they tie the hop-shoots to the poles with. She cut\r\nthem when they had attained their full substance, but were still _green_.\r\nThe rush at this age, consists of a body of _pith_ with a green _skin_ on\r\nit. You cut off both ends of the rush, and leave the prime part, which, on\r\nan average, may be about a foot and a half long. Then you take off all the\r\ngreen skin, except for about a fifth part of the way round the pith. Thus\r\nit is a piece of pith all but a little strip of skin in one part all the\r\nway up, which, observe, is necessary to hold the pith together all the way\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n195. The rushes being thus prepared, the _grease_ is melted, and put in a\r\nmelted state into something that is as _long_ as the rushes are. The\r\nrushes are put into the grease; soaked in it sufficiently; then taken out\r\nand laid in a bit of bark taken from a young tree, so as not to be too\r\nlarge. This bark is fixed up against the wall by a couple of straps put\r\nround it; and there it hangs for the purpose of holding the rushes.\r\n\r\n196. The rushes are carried about _in the hand_; but to sit by, to work\r\nby, or to go to bed by, they are fixed in _stands_ made for the purpose,\r\nsome of which are high to stand on the ground, and some low, to stand on a\r\ntable. These stands have an iron port something like a pair of _pliers_ to\r\nhold the rush in, and the rush is shifted forward from time to time, as it\r\nburns down to the thing that holds it.\r\n\r\n197. Now these rushes give a _better light_ than a common small\r\ndip-candle; and they cost next to nothing, though the labourer may with\r\nthem have as much light as he pleases, and though, without them he must\r\nsit the far greater part of the winter evenings _in the dark_, even if he\r\nexpend _fifteen shillings_ a year in candles. You may do any sort of work\r\nby this light; and, if reading be your taste, you may read the foul\r\nlibels, the lies and abuse, which are circulated gratis about _me_ by the\r\n\"Society for promoting _Christian Knowledge_,\" as well by rush-light, as\r\nyou can by the light of taxed candles; and, at any rate, you would have\r\none evil less; for to be deceived and to pay a tax for the deception are a\r\nlittle too much for even modern loyalty openly to demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD.\r\n\r\n198. Why _buy_ this, when you can _grow_ it in your garden? The stuff you\r\nbuy is half _drugs_; and is injurious to health. A _yard square_ of\r\nground, sown with common Mustard, the crop of which you would grind for\r\nuse, in a little mustard-mill, as you wanted it, would save you _some\r\nmoney_, and probably save your _life_. Your mustard would look _brown_\r\ninstead of _yellow_; but the former colour is as good as the latter: and,\r\nas to the _taste_, the _real_ mustard has certainly a much better than\r\nthat of the _drugs_ and flour which go under the name of mustard. Let any\r\none _try_ it, and I am sure he will never use the drugs again. The drugs,\r\nif you take them freely, leave _a burning at the pit of your stomach_,\r\nwhich the real mustard does not.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESS, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, AND FUEL.\r\n\r\n199. In Paragraph 152, I said, I think, enough to caution you, the English\r\nlabourer, against the taste, now too prevalent, for _fine_ and _flimsy_\r\ndress. It was, for hundreds of years, amongst the characteristics of the\r\nEnglish people, that their taste was, in all matters, for things solid,\r\nsound, and good; for the _useful_, and _decent_, the _cleanly_ in dress,\r\nand not for the _showy_. Let us hope that this may be the taste again; and\r\nlet us, my friends, fear no troubles, no perils, that may be necessary to\r\nproduce a return of that taste, accompanied with full bellies and warm\r\nbacks to the labouring classes.\r\n\r\n200. In _household goods_, the _warm_, the _strong_, the _durable_, ought\r\nalways to be kept in view. Oak tables, bedsteads and stools, chairs of oak\r\nor of yew tree, and never a bit of miserable deal board. Things of this\r\nsort ought to last several lifetimes. A labourer ought to inherit from his\r\ngreat grandfather something besides his toil. As to bedding, and other\r\nthings of that sort, all ought to be good in their nature, of a durable\r\nquality, and plain in their colour and form. The plates, dishes, mugs, and\r\nthings of that kind, should be of _pewter_, or even of wood. Any-thing is\r\nbetter than crockery-ware. Bottles to carry a-field should be of wood.\r\nFormerly, nobody but the gypsies and mumpers, that went a hop-picking in\r\nthe season, carried glass or earthen bottles. As to _glass_ of any sort, I\r\ndo not know what business it has in any man's house, unless he be rich\r\nenough to live on his means. It pays a tax, in many cases, to the amount\r\nof two-thirds of its cost. In short, when a house is once furnished with\r\nsufficient goods, there ought to be no renewal of hardly any part of them\r\nwanted for half an age, except in case of destruction by fire. Good\r\nmanagement in this way leaves the man's wages to provide an _abundance of\r\ngood food and good raiment_; and these are the things that make happy\r\nfamilies; these are the things that make a good, kind, sincere, and brave\r\npeople; not little pamphlets about \"loyalty\" and \"content.\" A good man\r\nwill be contented fast enough, if he be fed and clad sufficiently; but if\r\na man be not well fed and clad, he is a base wretch to be contented.\r\n\r\n201. _Fuel_ should be, if possible, provided in summer, or at least some\r\nof it. Turf and peat must be got in summer, and some _wood_ may. In the\r\nwoodland countries, the next winter ought to be thought of in _June_, when\r\npeople hardly know what to do with the fuelwood; and something should, if\r\npossible, be saved in the bark-harvest to get a part of the fuel for the\r\nnext winter. Fire is a capital article. To have no fire, or a bad fire, to\r\nsit by, is a most dismal thing. In such a state man and wife must be\r\nsomething out of the common way to be in good humour with each other, to\r\nsay nothing of colds and other ailments which are the natural consequence\r\nof such misery. If we suppose the great Creator to condescend to survey\r\nhis works in detail, what object can be so pleasing to him as that of the\r\nlabourer, after his return from the toils of a cold winter day, sitting\r\nwith his wife and children round a cheerful fire, while the wind whistles\r\nin the chimney and the rain pelts the roof? But, of all God's creation,\r\nwhat is so miserable to behold or to think of as a wretched, half-starved\r\nfamily creeping to their nest of flocks or straw, there to lie shivering,\r\ntill sent forth by the fear of absolutely expiring from want?\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPS.\r\n\r\n202. I treated of them before; but before I conclude this little Work, it\r\nis necessary to speak of them again. I made a mistake as to the _tax_ on\r\nthe Hops. The positive tax is 2_d._ a pound, and I (in former editions)\r\nstated it at 4_d._ However, in all such cases, there falls upon the\r\n_consumer_ the _expenses_ attending the paying of the tax. That is to say,\r\nthe cost of interest of capital in the grower who pays the tax, and who\r\nmust pay for it, whether his hops be cheap or dear. Then the _trouble_ it\r\ngives him, and the rules he is compelled to obey in the drying and\r\nbagging, and which cause him great _expense_. So that the tax on hops of\r\nour own English growth, may _now be reckoned_ to cost the _consumer_ about\r\n3-1/4_d._ a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEAST.\r\n\r\n203. Yeast is a great thing in domestic management. I have once before\r\npublished a receipt for making _yeast-cakes_, I will do it again here.\r\n\r\n204. In Long Island they make _yeast-cakes_. A parcel of these cakes is\r\nmade _once a year_. That is often enough. And, when you bake, you take one\r\nof these cakes (or more according to the bulk of the batch) and with them\r\nraise your bread. The very best bread I ever ate in my life was lightened\r\nwith these cakes.\r\n\r\n205. The materials for a good batch of cakes are as follows:--3 ounces of\r\ngood fresh Hops; 3-1/2 pounds of Rye Flour; 7 pounds of Indian Corn Meal;\r\nand one Gallon of Water.--Rub the hops, so as to separate them. Put them\r\ninto the water, which is to be boiling at the time. Let them boil half an\r\nhour. Then strain the liquor through a fine sieve into an earthen vessel.\r\nWhile the liquor is hot, put in the Rye-Flour; stirring the liquor well,\r\nand quickly, as the Rye-Flour goes into it. The day after, when it is\r\nworking, put in the Indian Meal, stirring it well as it goes in. Before\r\nthe Indian Meal be all in, the mess will be very stiff; and it will, in\r\nfact, be _dough_, very much of the consistence of the dough that bread is\r\nmade of.--Take this dough; knead it well, as you would for _pie-crust_.\r\nRoll it out with a rolling-pin, as you roll out pie-crust, to the\r\nthickness of about a third of an inch. When you have it (or a part of it\r\nat a time) rolled out, cut it up into cakes with a tumbler glass turned\r\nupside down, or with something else that will answer the same purpose.\r\nTake a clean board (a _tin_ may be better) and put the cakes _to dry in\r\nthe sun_. Turn them every day; let them receive _no wet_; and they will\r\nbecome as hard as ship biscuit. Put them into a bag, or box, and keep them\r\nin a place _perfectly free from damp_. When you bake, take two cakes, of\r\nthe thickness above-mentioned, and about 3 inches in diameter; put them\r\ninto hot water, _over-night_, having cracked them first. Let the vessel\r\ncontaining them stand near the fire-place all night. They will dissolve by\r\nthe morning, and then you use them in setting your sponge (as it is\r\ncalled) precisely as you would use the yeast of beer.\r\n\r\n206. There are _two things_ which may be considered by the reader as\r\nobstacles. FIRST, where are _we_ to get the _Indian Meal_? Indian Meal is\r\nused merely because it is of a _less adhesive_ nature than that of wheat.\r\nWhite pea-meal, or even barley-meal, would do just as well. But SECOND, to\r\n_dry_ the cakes, to make them (and _quickly_ too, mind) _as hard as ship\r\nbiscuit_ (which is much harder than the timber of Scotch firs or Canada\r\nfirs;) and to do this _in the sun_ (for it must not be _fire_,) where are\r\nwe, in this climate, to _get the sun_? In 1816 we could not; for, that\r\nyear, melons rotted in the _glazed frames_ and never ripened. But, in\r\nevery nine summers out of ten, we have in June, in July, or in August, _a\r\nfortnight of hot sun_, and that is enough. Nature has not given us a\r\n_peach-climate_; but we _get peaches_. The cakes, when put in the sun, may\r\nhave a _glass sash_, or a _hand-light_, put over them. This would make\r\ntheir birth _hotter_ than that of the hottest open-air situation in\r\nAmerica. In short to a farmer's wife, or any good housewife, all the\r\nlittle difficulties to the attainment of such an object would appear as\r\nnothing. The _will_ only is required; and, if there be not that, it is\r\nuseless to think of the attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWING SWEDISH TURNIP SEED.\r\n\r\n207. It is necessary to be a little more full than I have been before as\r\nto the _manner of sowing_ this seed; and I shall make my directions such\r\nas to be applied on a small or a large scale.--Those that want to\r\ntransplant on a large scale will, of course, as to the other parts of the\r\nbusiness, refer to my larger work.--It is to get plants for\r\n_transplanting_ that I mean to sow the Swedish Turnip Seed. The _time_ for\r\nsowing must depend a little upon the nature of the situation and soil. In\r\nthe north of England, perhaps early in April may be best; but, in any of\r\nthese southern counties, any time after the _middle of April and before\r\nthe 10th of May_, is quite early enough. The ground which is to receive\r\nthe seed should be made very _fine_, and manured with wood-ashes, or with\r\ngood compost well mixed with the earth. Dung is not so good; for it breeds\r\nthe fly more; or, at least, I think so. The seed should be sown in drills\r\n_an inch deep_, made as pointed out under the head of _Sowing_ in my book\r\non _Gardening_. When deposited in the drills _evenly_ but _not thickly_,\r\nthe ground should be raked across the drills, so as to fill them up; and\r\nthen the whole of the ground should be _trodden hard_, with shoes not\r\nnailed, and not very thick in the sole. The ground should be laid out in\r\nfour-feet _beds_ for the reasons mentioned in the \"_Gardener_.\" When the\r\nseeds come up, thin the plants to two inches apart as soon as you think\r\nthem clear from the fly; for, if left thicker, they injure each other even\r\nin this infant state. Hoe frequently between the rows even before thinning\r\nthe plants; and when they are thinned, hoe well and frequently between\r\nthem; for this has a tendency to make them strong; and the hoeing _before\r\nthinning_ helps to keep off the fly. A rod of ground, the rows being eight\r\ninches apart, and plants two inches apart in the row, will contain about\r\n_two thousand two hundred_ plants. An acre in rows four feet apart and the\r\nplants a foot apart in the row, will take about ten thousand four hundred\r\nand sixty plants. So that to transplant an acre, you must sow about _five\r\nrods of ground_. The plants should be kept very clean; and, by the last\r\nweek in June, or first in July, you put them out. I have put them out (in\r\nEngland) at all times between 7th of June and middle of August. The first\r\nis certainly earlier than I like; and the very finest I ever grew in\r\nEngland, and the finest I ever saw for a large piece, were transplanted on\r\nthe 14th of July. But one year with another, the last week in June is the\r\nbest time. For size of plants, manner of transplanting, intercultivation,\r\npreparing the land, and the rest, see \"_Year's Residence in America_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VIII.\r\n\r\n_On the converting of English Grass, and Grain Plants cut green, into\r\nStraw, for the purpose of making Plat for Hats and Bonnets._\r\n\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON, MAY 30, 1823.\r\n\r\n208. The foregoing Numbers have treated, chiefly, of the management of the\r\naffairs of a labourer's family, and more particularly of the mode of\r\ndisposing of the money earned by the labour of the family. The present\r\nNumber will point out what I hope may become _an advantageous kind of\r\nlabour_. All along I have proceeded upon the supposition, that the wife\r\nand children of the labourer be, as constantly as possible, employed _in\r\nwork of some sort or other_. The cutting, the bleaching, the sorting, and\r\nthe platting of straw, seem to be, of all employments, the best suited to\r\nthe wives and children of country labourers; and the discovery which I\r\nhave made, as to the means of obtaining the necessary materials, will\r\nenable them to enter at once upon that employment.\r\n\r\n209. Before I proceed to give my directions relative to the performance of\r\nthis sort of labour, I shall give a sort of history of the discovery to\r\nwhich I have just alluded.\r\n\r\n210. The practice of making hats, bonnets, and other things, of _straw_,\r\nis perhaps of very ancient date; but not to waste time in fruitless\r\ninquiries, it is very well known that, for many years past, straw\r\ncoverings for the head have been greatly in use in England, in America,\r\nand, indeed, in almost all the countries that we know much of. In this\r\ncountry the manufacture was, only a few years ago, _very flourishing_; but\r\nit has now greatly declined, and has left in poverty and misery those whom\r\nit once well fed and clothed.\r\n\r\n211. The cause of this change has been, the importation of the straw hats\r\nand bonnets from _Italy_, greatly superior, in durability and beauty, to\r\nthose made in England. The plat made in England was made of the straw of\r\n_ripened grain_. It was, in general, _split_; but the main circumstance\r\nwas, that it was made of the straw of _ripened grain_; while the Italian\r\nplat was made of the straw of grain, or grass, _cut green_. Now, the straw\r\nof ripened grain or grass is brittle; or, rather, rotten. It _dies_ while\r\nstanding, and, in point of toughness, the difference between it and straw\r\nfrom plants cut green is much about the same as the difference between a\r\nstick that has _died on the tree_, and one that has been _cut from the\r\ntree_. But besides the difference in point of toughness, strength, and\r\ndurability, there was the difference in beauty. The colour of the Italian\r\nplat was better; the plat was brighter; and the Indian straws, being\r\n_small whole_ straws, instead of small straws made by the splitting of\r\nlarge ones, here was a _roundness_ in them, that gave _light and shade_ to\r\nthe plat, which could not be given by our flat bits of straw.\r\n\r\n212. It seems odd, that nobody should have set to work to find out how the\r\nItalians _came_ by this fine straw. The importation of these Italian\r\narticles was chiefly from the port of LEGHORN; and therefore the bonnets\r\nimported were called _Leghorn Bonnets_. The straw manufacturers in this\r\ncountry seem to have made no effort to resist this invasion from Leghorn.\r\nAnd, which is very curious, the Leghorn _straw_ has now began to be\r\nimported, and to be _platted in this country_. So that we had _hands_ to\r\nplat as well as the Italians. All that we wanted was the _same kind of\r\nstraw_ that the Italians had: and it is truly wonderful that these\r\nimportations from Leghorn should have gone on increasing year after year,\r\nand our domestic manufacture dwindling away at a like pace, without there\r\nhaving been any inquiry relative to the way in which the Italians _got\r\ntheir straw_! Strange, that we should have imported even _straw_ from\r\nItaly, without inquiring whether similar straw could not be got in\r\nEngland! There really seems to have been an opinion, that England could no\r\nmore produce this straw than it could produce the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\n213. Things were in this state, when in 1821, a Miss WOODHOUSE, a farmer's\r\ndaughter in CONNECTICUT, sent a straw-bonnet of her own making to the\r\n_Society of Arts_ in London. This bonnet, superior in fineness and beauty\r\nto anything of the kind that had come from Leghorn, the maker stated to\r\nconsist of a sort of grass of which she sent along with the bonnet some of\r\nthe _seeds_. The question was, then, would these precious seeds _grow and\r\nproduce plants in perfection in England_? A large quantity of the seed had\r\nnot been sent: and it was therefore, by a member of the Society, thought\r\ndesirable to get, with as little delay as possible, a considerable\r\nquantity of the seed.\r\n\r\n214. It was in this stage of the affair that my attention was called to\r\nit. The member just alluded to applied to me to get the seed from America.\r\nI was of opinion that there could be no sort of grass in Connecticut that\r\nwould not, and that _did not_, grow and flourish in England. My son JAMES,\r\nwho was then at New-York, had instructions from me, in June 1821, to go to\r\nMiss WOODHOUSE, and to send me home an account of the matter. In\r\nSeptember, the same year, I heard from him, who sent me an account of the\r\ncutting and bleaching, and also a specimen of the plat and grass of\r\nConnecticut. Miss WOODHOUSE had told the Society of Arts, that the grass\r\nused was the _Poa Pratensis_. This is the _smooth-stalked meadow-grass_.\r\nSo that it was quite useless to send for _seed_. It was clear, that we had\r\n_grass enough_ in England, if we could but make it into straw as handsome\r\nas that of Italy.\r\n\r\n215. Upon my publishing an account of what had taken place with regard to\r\nthe American Bonnet, _an importer of Italian straw_ applied to me to know\r\nwhether I would _undertake to import American straw_. He was in the habit\r\nof importing Italian straw, and of having it platted in this country; but\r\nhaving seen the bonnet of Miss WOODHOUSE, he was anxious to get the\r\nAmerican straw. This gentleman showed me some Italian straw which he had\r\nimported, and as the seed heads were not on, I could not see what plant it\r\nwas. The gentleman who showed the straw to me, told me (and, doubtless, he\r\nbelieved) that the plant was one that _would not grow in England_. I\r\nhowever, who looked at the straw with the eyes of a farmer, perceived that\r\nit consisted of dry _oat_, _wheat_, and _rye_ plants, and of _Bennet_ and\r\nother _common grass_ plants.\r\n\r\n216. This quite settled the point of _growth in England_. It was now\r\ncertain that we had the plants in abundance; and the only question that\r\nremained to be determined was, Had we SUN to give to those plants the\r\nbeautiful colour which the American and Italian straw had? If that colour\r\nwere to be obtained by _art_, by any chemical applications, we could\r\nobtain it as easily as the Americans or the Italians; but, if it were the\r\ngift of the SUN solely, here might be a difficulty impossible for us to\r\novercome. My experiments have proved that the fear of such difficulty was\r\nwholly groundless.\r\n\r\n217. It was late in September 1821 that I obtained this knowledge, as to\r\nthe kind of plants that produced the foreign straw. I could, at that time\r\nof the year, do nothing in the way of removing my doubts as to the _powers\r\nof our Sun_ in the bleaching of grass; but I resolved to do this when the\r\nproper season for bleaching should return. Accordingly, when the next\r\nmonth of _June_ came, I went into the country for the purpose. I made my\r\nexperiments, and, in short, I proved to demonstration, that we had not\r\nonly the _plants_, but the _sun_ also, necessary for the making of straw,\r\nyielding in no respect to that of America or of Italy. I think that, upon\r\nthe whole, we have greatly the advantage of those countries; for grass is\r\nmore abundant in this country than in any other. It flourishes here more\r\nthan in any other country. It is here in a greater variety of sorts; and\r\nfor _fineness_ in point of size, there is no part of the world which can\r\nequal what might be obtained from some of our _downs_, merely by keeping\r\nthe land ungrazed till the month of July.\r\n\r\n218. When I had obtained the straw, I got some of it made into plat. One\r\npiece of this plat was equal in point of colour, and superior in point of\r\nfineness, even to the plat of the bonnet, of Miss WOODHOUSE. It seemed,\r\ntherefore, now to be necessary to do nothing more than to _make all this\r\nwell known to the country_. As the SOCIETY OF ARTS had interested itself\r\nin the matter, and as I heard that, through its laudable zeal, several\r\n_sowings of the foreign grass-seed_ had been made in England, I\r\ncommunicated an account of my experiments to that Society. The first\r\ncommunication was made by me on the 19th of February last, when I sent to\r\nthe Society, specimens of my straw and also of the plat. Some time after\r\nthis I attended a committee of the Society on the subject, and gave them a\r\nverbal account of the way in which I had gone to work.\r\n\r\n219. The committee had, before this, given some of my straw to certain\r\n_manufacturers_ of plat, in order to see what it would produce. These\r\nmanufacturers, with the exception of one, brought _such_ specimens of plat\r\nas to induce, at first sight, any one to believe that it was nonsense to\r\nthink of bringing the thing to any degree of perfection! But, was it\r\n_possible_ to believe this? Was it possible to believe that it could\r\n_answer_ to import straw from Italy, to pay a twenty per cent. duty on\r\nthat straw, and to have it platted here; and that it would _not answer_\r\nto turn into plat straw of just the same sort grown in England? It was\r\nimpossible to believe _this_; but possible enough to believe, that persons\r\nnow making profit by Italian straw, or plat, or bonnets, would rather that\r\nEnglish straw should come to shut out the Italian and to put an end to the\r\nLeghorn trade.\r\n\r\n220. In order to show the character of the reports of those manufacturers,\r\nI sent some parcels of straw into Hertfordshire, and got back, in the\r\ncourse of five days, _fifteen specimens of plat_. These I sent to the\r\nSociety of Arts on the 3d of April; and I here insert a copy of the letter\r\nwhich accompanied them.\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS.\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON, April 3, 1823.\r\n\r\nSIR,--With this letter I send you sixteen specimens of plat, and also\r\neight parcels of straw, in order to show the sorts that the plat is made\r\nout of. The numbers of the plat correspond with those of the straw; but\r\neach parcel of straw has two numbers attached to it, except in the case of\r\nthe first number, which is the _wheat straw_. Of each kind of straw a\r\nparcel of the _stoutest_ and a parcel of the _smallest_ were sent to be\r\nplatted; so that each parcel of the straw now sent, except that of the\r\nwheat, refers to _two of the pieces of plat_. For instance, 2 and 3 of the\r\nplat is of the sort of straw marked 2 and 3; 4 and 12 of the plat is of\r\nthe sort of straw marked 4 and 12; and so on. These parcels of straw are\r\nsent in order that you may know the _kind_ of straw, or rather, of grass,\r\nfrom which the several pieces of plat have been made. This is very\r\n_material_; because it is by those parcels of straw that the _kinds of\r\ngrass_ are to be known.\r\n\r\nThe piece of plat No. 16 is _American_; all the rest are from my straw.\r\nYou will see, that 15 is the _finest plat of all_. No. 7 is from the\r\n_stout_ straws of the same _kind_ as No. 15. By looking at the parcel of\r\nstraw Nos. 7 and 15, you will see what sort of grass this is. The next, in\r\npoint of beauty and fineness combined, are the pieces Nos. 13 and 8; and\r\nby looking at the parcel of straw, Nos. 13 and 8, you will see what sort\r\nof grass that is. Next comes 10 and 5, which are very beautiful too; and\r\nthe sort of grass, you will see, is the _common Bennet_. The wheat, you\r\nsee, is too coarse; and the rest of the sorts are either _too hard_ or\r\n_too brittle_. I beg you to look at Nos. 10 and 5. Those appear to me to\r\nbe the thing to supplant the Leghorn. The colour is good, the straws _work\r\nwell_, they afford a great _variety of sizes_, and they come from the\r\ncommon _Bennet grass_, which grows all over the kingdom, which is\r\ncultivated in all our fields, which is in bloom in the fair month of June,\r\nwhich may be grown as fine or as coarse as we please, and ten acres of\r\nwhich would, I dare say, make ten thousand bonnets. However, 7 and 15, and\r\n8 and 13, are very good; and they are to be got in every part of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nAs to _platters_, it is to be too childish to believe that they are not to\r\nbe got, when I could send off these straws, and get back the plat, in the\r\ncourse of five days. Far _better work_ than this would have been obtained\r\nif I could have gone on the errand myself. What then will people not do,\r\nwho regularly undertake the business for their livelihood?\r\n\r\nI will, as soon as possible, send you an account of the manner in which I\r\nwent to work with the grass. The card or plat, which I sent you some time\r\nago, you will be so good as to give me back again some time; because I\r\nhave now not a bit of the American plat left.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n221. I should observe, that these written communications, of mine to the\r\nSociety, _belong_, in fact, to it, and will be published in its\r\nPROCEEDINGS, a volume of which comes out every year; but, in this case,\r\nthere would have been _a year lost_ to those who may act in consequence of\r\nthese communications being made public. The grass is to be got, in great\r\nquantities and of the best sorts, only in _June_ and _July_; and the\r\nSociety's volume does not come out till _December_. The Society has,\r\ntherefore, given its consent to the making of the communications public\r\nthrough the means of this little work of mine.\r\n\r\n222. Having shown what sort of plat could be produced from English\r\ngrass-straw, I next communicated to the Society an account of the method\r\nwhich I pursued in the cutting and bleaching of the grass. The letter in\r\nwhich I did this I shall here insert a copy of, before I proceed further.\r\nIn the original the paragraphs were _numbered_ from _one_ to _seventeen_:\r\nthey are here marked by _letters_, in order to avoid confusion, the\r\nparagraphs of the work itself being marked by _numbers_.\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS.\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON, April 14, 1823.\r\n\r\nA.--SIR,--Agreeably to your request, I now communicate to you a statement\r\nof those particulars which you wished to possess, relative to the\r\nspecimens of straw and of plat which I have at different times sent to you\r\nfor the inspection of the Society.\r\n\r\nB.--That my statement may not come too abruptly upon those members of the\r\nSociety who have not had an opportunity of witnessing the progress of this\r\ninteresting inquiry, I will take a short review of the circumstances which\r\nled to the making of my experiments.\r\n\r\nC.--In the month of June, 1821, a gentleman, a member of the Society,\r\ninformed me, by letter, that a Miss WOODHOUSE, a farmer's daughter, of\r\nWeathersfield, in Connecticut, had transmitted to the Society a\r\nstraw-bonnet of very fine materials and manufacture; that this bonnet\r\n(according to her account) was made from the straw of a sort of grass\r\ncalled _poa pratensis_; that it seemed to be unknown whether the same\r\ngrass would grow in England; that it was desirable to ascertain whether\r\nthis grass would grow in England; that, at all events, it was desirable\r\nto get from America some of the seed of this grass; and that, for this\r\npurpose, my informant, knowing that I had a son in America; addressed\r\nhimself to me, it being his opinion that, if materials similar to those\r\nused by Miss WOODHOUSE could by any means be _grown in England_, the\r\nbenefit to the nation must be considerable.\r\n\r\nD.--In consequence of this application, I wrote to my son James, (then at\r\nNew York,) directing him to do what he was able in order to cause success\r\nto the undertaking. On the receipt of my letter, in July, he went from New\r\nYork to Weathersfield, (about a hundred and twenty miles;) saw Miss\r\nWOODHOUSE; made the necessary inquiries; obtained a specimen of the grass,\r\nand also of the plat, which other persons at Weathersfield, as well as\r\nMiss WOODHOUSE, were in the habit of making; and having acquired the\r\nnecessary information as to cutting the grass and bleaching the straw, he\r\ntransmitted to me an account of the matter; which account, together with\r\nhis specimens of grass and plat, I received in the month of September.\r\n\r\nE.--I was now, when I came to see the specimen of grass, convinced that\r\nMiss WOODHOUSE'S materials could be _grown in England_; a conviction\r\nwhich, if it had not been complete at once, would have been made complete\r\nimmediately afterwards by the sight of a bunch of bonnet-straw _imported\r\nfrom Leghorn_, which straw was shown to me by the importer, and which I\r\nfound to be that of two or three sorts of our common grass, and of oats,\r\nwheat, and rye.\r\n\r\nF.--That the grass, or plants, could be _grown in England_ was, therefore,\r\nnow certain, and indeed that they were, in point of commonness, next to\r\nthe earth itself. But before the grass could, with propriety, be called\r\nmaterials for bonnet-making, there was the _bleaching_ to be performed;\r\nand it was by no means certain that this could be accomplished by means of\r\nan _English sun_, the difference between which and that of Italy or\r\nConnecticut was well known to be very great.\r\n\r\nG.--My experiments have, I presume, completely removed this doubt. I think\r\nthat the straw produced by me to the Society, and also some of the pieces\r\nof plat, are of a colour which no straw or plat can surpass. All that\r\nremains, therefore, is for me to give an account of the manner in which I\r\ncut and bleached the grass which I have submitted to the Society in the\r\nstate of straw.\r\n\r\nH.--First, as to the _season_ of the year, all the straw, except that of\r\none sort of couch-grass, and the long coppice-grass, which two were got in\r\nSussex, were got from grass cut in Hertfordshire on the 21st of June. A\r\ngrass head-land, in a wheat-field, had been mowed during the forepart of\r\nthe day, and in the afternoon I went and took a handful here and a handful\r\nthere out of the swaths. When I had collected as much as I could well\r\ncarry, I took it to my friend's house, and proceeded to prepare it for\r\nbleaching, according to the information sent me from America by my son;\r\nthat is to say, I put my grass into a shallow tub, put boiling water upon\r\nit until it was covered by the water, let it remain in that state for ten\r\nminutes, then took it out, and laid it very thinly on a closely-mowed lawn\r\nin a garden. But I should observe, that, before I put the grass into the\r\ntub, I tied it up in small bundles, or sheaves, each bundle being about\r\nsix inches through at the butt-end. This was necessary, in order to be\r\nable to take the grass, at the end of ten minutes, out of the water,\r\nwithout throwing it into a confused mixture as to tops and tails. Being\r\ntied up in little bundles, I could easily, with a prong, take it out of\r\nthe hot water. The bundles were put into a large wicker basket, carried to\r\nthe lawn in the garden, and there taken out, one by one, and laid in\r\nswaths as before-mentioned.\r\n\r\nI.--It was laid _very thinly_; almost might I say, that no stalk of grass\r\ncovered another. The swaths were _turned_ once a day. The bleaching was\r\ncompleted at the end of _seven days_ from time of scalding and laying\r\nout. June is a fine month. The grass was, as it happened, cut on the\r\n_longest day in the year_; and the weather was remarkably fine and clear.\r\nBut the grass which I afterwards cut in Sussex, was cut in the first week\r\nin August; and as to the weather my journal speaks thus:--\r\n\r\n  August, 1822.\r\n\r\n    2d.--Thunder and rain.--_Began cutting grass._\r\n    3d.--Beautiful day.\r\n   4th.--Fine day.\r\n   5th.--Cloudy day--_Began scalding grass, and laying it out._\r\n   6th.--Cloudy greater part of the day.\r\n   7th.--Same weather.\r\n   8th.--Cloudy and rather misty.--_Finished cutting grass._\r\n   9th.--Dry but cloudy.\r\n  10th.--Very close and hot.--_Packed up part of the grass._\r\n  11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th.--Same weather.\r\n  15th.--Hot and clear.--_Finished packing the grass._\r\n\r\nK.--The grass cut in Sussex was as _well bleached_ as that cut in\r\nHertfordshire; so that it is evident that we never can have a summer that\r\nwill not afford sun sufficient for this business.\r\n\r\nL.--The part of the straw used for platting; that part of the stalk which\r\nis _above the upper joint_; that part which is between the _upper joint_\r\nand the seed-branches. This part is taken out, and the rest of the straw\r\nthrown away. But the _whole plant must be cut and bleached_; because, if\r\nyou were to take off, _when green_, the part above described, that part\r\nwould wither up next to nothing. This part must die in company with the\r\nwhole plants, and be separated from the other parts after the bleaching\r\nhas been performed.\r\n\r\nM.--The time of cutting must vary with the seasons, the situation, and the\r\nsort of grass. The grass which I got in Hertfordshire, than which nothing\r\ncan, I think, be more beautiful, was, when cut, generally in _bloom_; just\r\nin bloom. The _wheat_ was in full bloom; so that a good time for getting\r\ngrass may be considered to be that when the _wheat is in bloom_. When I\r\ncut the grass in Sussex, the _wheat was ripe_, for reaping had begun; but\r\nthat grass is of a very backward sort, and, besides, grew in the _shade_\r\namongst coppice-wood and under trees, which stood pretty thick.\r\n\r\nN.--As to the sorts of grass, I have to observe generally, that in\r\nproportion as the colour of the grass is _deep_; that is to say, getting\r\nfurther from the _yellow_, and nearer to the _blue_, it is of a deep and\r\n_dead yellow_ when it becomes straw. Those kinds of grass are best which\r\nare, in point of colour, nearest to that of wheat, which is a fresh pale\r\ngreen. Another thing is, the quality of the straw as to _pliancy_ and\r\n_toughness_. Experience must be our guide here. I had not time to make a\r\nlarge collection of sorts; but those which I have sent to you contain\r\nthree sorts which are proved to be good. In my letter of the 3d instant I\r\nsent you _sixteen_ pieces of plat and _eight_ bunches of straw, having the\r\nseed heads on, in order to show the sorts of grass. The sixteenth piece of\r\nplat was American. The first piece was from _wheat_ cut and bleached by\r\nme; the rest from _grass_ cut and bleached by me. I will here, for fear of\r\nmistake, give a list of the names of the several sorts of grass, the straw\r\nof which was sent with my letter of the 3d instant, referring to the\r\nnumbers, as placed on the plat and on the bunches of straw.\r\n\r\n   PIECES         BUNCHES        SORTS\r\n  OF PLAT.

But the\r\nsame English names are not in the country given to these sorts of grass.\r\nThe _Fiorin grass_, the _Yellow Oat-grass_, and the _Brown-Bent_, are all\r\ncalled _couch-grass_; except that the latter is, in Sussex, called _Red\r\nRobin_. It is the native grass of the _plains_ of Long Island; and they\r\ncall it _Red Top_. The _Ray-grass_ is the common field grass, which is,\r\nall over the kingdom, sown with clover. The farmers, in a great part of\r\nthe kingdom, call it _Bent_, or _Bennett_, grass; and sometimes it is\r\ngalled _Darnel-grass_. The _Crested Dog's-tail_ goes, in Sussex, by the\r\nname of _Hendonbent_; for what reason I know not. The _sweet-scented\r\nVernal-grass_ I have never, amongst the farmers, heard any name for. Miss\r\nWOODHOUSE'S grass appears, from the _plants_ that I saw in the Adelphi, to\r\nbe one of the sorts of Couch-grass. Indeed, I am sure that it is a\r\nCouch-grass, if the plants I there saw came from her seed. My son, who\r\nwent into Connecticut, who saw the grass growing, and who sent me home a\r\nspecimen of it, is now in England: he was with me when I cut the grass in\r\nSussex; and he says that Miss WOODHOUSE'S was a Couch-grass. However, it\r\nis impossible to look at the specimens of straw and of plat which I have\r\nsent you, without being convinced that there is no want of the raw\r\nmaterial in England. I was, after my first hearing of the subject, very\r\nsoon convinced that the grass grew in England; but I had great doubts as\r\nto the capacity of our _sun_. Those doubts my own experiments have\r\ncompletely removed; but then I was not aware of the great effect of the\r\n_scalding_, of which, by the way, Miss WOODHOUSE had said nothing, and the\r\nknowledge of which we owe entirely to my son James' journey into\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nP.--Having thus given you an account of the time and manner of cutting the\r\ngrass, of the mode of cutting and bleaching; having given you the best\r\naccount I am able, as to the sorts of grass to be employed in this\r\nbusiness; and having, in my former communications, given you specimens of\r\nthe plat wrought from the several sorts of straw, I might here close my\r\nletter; but as it may be useful to speak of _the expense_ of cutting and\r\nbleaching, I shall trouble you with a few words relating to it. If there\r\nwere a field of _Ray-grass_, or of _Crested Dog's-tail_, or any other good\r\nsort, and nothing else growing with it, the expense of _cutting_ would be\r\nvery little indeed, seeing that the _scythe_ or _reap-hook_ would do the\r\nbusiness at a great rate. Doubtless there _will be_ such fields; but even\r\nif the grass have to be cut by the handful, my opinion is, that the\r\nexpense of cutting and bleaching would not exceed _fourpence_ for straw\r\nenough to make a large bonnet. I should be willing to contract to supply\r\nstraw, at this rate, for half a million of bonnets. The _scalding_ must\r\nconstitute a considerable part of the expense; because there must be\r\n_fresh water_ for every parcel of grass that you put in the tub. When\r\nwater has scalded one parcel of cold grass, it will not scald another\r\nparcel. Besides, the scalding draws out the _sweet matter_ of the grass,\r\nand makes the water the colour of that horrible stuff called London\r\nporter. It would be very good, by-the-by, to give to pigs. Many people\r\ngive _hay-tea_ to pigs and calves; and this is _grass-tea_. To scald a\r\nlarge quantity, therefore would require means not usually at hand, and the\r\nscalding is an essential part of the business. Perhaps, in a large and\r\nconvenient farm-house, with a good brewing copper, good fuel and water\r\nhandy, four or five women might scald a wagon load in a day; and a wagon\r\nwould, I think, carry straw enough (in the rough) to furnish the means of\r\nmaking a thousand bonnets. However, the scalding _might_ take place _in\r\nthe field itself_, by means of a portable boiler, especially if water were\r\nat hand; and perhaps it would be better to carry the water to the field\r\nthan to carry the grass to the farm-house, for there must be _ground to\r\nlay it out upon the moment it has been scalded_, and no ground can be so\r\nproper as the newly-mowed ground where the grass has stood. The _space_,\r\ntoo, must be _large_, for any considerable quantity of grass. As to all\r\nthese things, however, the best and cheapest methods will soon be\r\ndiscovered when people set about the work with a view to profit.\r\n\r\nQ.--The Society will want nothing from me, nor from any-body else, to\r\nconvince it of the importance of this matter; but I cannot, in concluding\r\nthese communications to you, Sir, refrain from making an observation or\r\ntwo on the consequences likely to arise out of these inquiries. The\r\nmanufacture is alone of considerable magnitude. Not less than about _five\r\nmillions_ of persons in this kingdom have a dress which consists partly of\r\nmanufactured straw; and a large part, and all the most expensive part, of\r\nthe articles thus used, now come from abroad. In cases where you can get\r\nfrom abroad any article at _less expense than you can get it at home_, the\r\nwisdom of fabricating that article at home may be doubted. But, in this\r\ncase, you get the raw material by labour performed at home, and the cost\r\nof that labour is not nearly so great as would be the cost of the mere\r\ncarriage of the straw from a foreign country to this. If our own people\r\nhad all plenty of employment, and that too more profitable to them and to\r\nthe country than the turning of a part of our own grass into articles of\r\ndress, then it would be advisable still to import Leghorn bonnets; but the\r\nfacts being the reverse, it is clear, that whatever money, or money's\r\nworth things, be sent out of the country, in exchange for Leghorn bonnets,\r\nis, while we have the raw material here for next to nothing, just so much\r\nthrown away. The Italians, it may be said, take some of our manufactures\r\nin exchange; and let us suppose, for the purpose of illustration, that\r\nthey take cloth from Yorkshire. Stop the exchange between Leghorn and\r\nYorkshire, and, does Yorkshire _lose part of its custom_? No: for though\r\nthose who make the bonnets out of English grass, prevent the Leghorners\r\nfrom buying Yorkshire cloth, they, with the money which they now get,\r\ninstead of its being got by the Leghorners, buy the Yorkshire cloth\r\nthemselves; and they wear this cloth too, instead of its being worn by the\r\npeople of Italy; ay, Sir, and many, now in rags, will be well clad, if the\r\nlaudable object of the Society be effected. Besides this, however, why\r\nshould we not _export_ the articles of this manufacture? To America we\r\ncertainly should; and I should not be at all surprised if we were to\r\nexport them to Leghorn itself.\r\n\r\nR.--Notwithstanding all this, however, if the manufacture were of a\r\ndescription to require, in order to give it success, the _collecting of\r\nthe manufacturers together in great numbers_, I should, however great the\r\nwealth that it might promise, never have done any thing to promote its\r\nestablishment. The contrary is happily the case: here all is not only\r\nperformed _by hand_, but by hand _singly_, without any combination of\r\nhands. Here there is no power of machinery or of chemistry wanted. All is\r\nperformed out in the open fields, or sitting in the cottage. There wants\r\nno coal mines and no rivers to assist; no water-powers nor powers of fire.\r\nNo part of the kingdom is unfit for the business. Every-where there are\r\ngrass, water, sun, and women and children's fingers; and these are all\r\nthat are wanted. But, the great thing of all is this; that, to obtain the\r\nmaterials for the making of this article of dress, at once so gay, so\r\nuseful, and in some cases so expensive, there requires not _a penny of\r\ncapital_. Many of the labourers now make their own straw hats to wear in\r\nsummer. Poor rotten things, made out of straw of ripened grain. With what\r\nsatisfaction will they learn that straw, twenty times as durable, to say\r\nnothing of the beauty, is to be got from every hedge? In short when the\r\npeople are well and clearly informed of the facts, which I have through\r\nyou, Sir, had the honour to lay before the Society, it is next to\r\nimpossible that the manufacture should not become general throughout the\r\ncountry. In every labourer's house a pot of water can be boiled. What\r\nlabourer's wife cannot, in the summer months, find time to cut and bleach\r\ngrass enough to give her and her children work for a part of the winter?\r\nThere is no necessity for all to be _platters_. Some may cut and bleach\r\nonly. Others may prepare the straw, as mentioned in paragraph L. of this\r\nletter. And doubtless, as the farmers in Hertfordshire now sell their\r\nstraw to the platters, grass collectors and bleachers and preparers would\r\ndo the same. So that there is scarcely any country labourer's family that\r\nmight not derive some advantage from this discovery; and, while I am\r\nconvinced that this consideration has been by no means over-looked by the\r\nSociety, it has been, I assure you, the great consideration of all with,\r\n\r\n  Sir, your most obedient and\r\n  most humble Servant,\r\n  WM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n223. In the last edition, this closing part of the work, relative to the\r\nstraw plat, was not presented to the public as a thing which admitted of\r\nno alteration; but, on the contrary, it was presented to the public with\r\nthe following concluding remark: \"In conclusion I have to observe, that I\r\nby no means send forth this essay as containing opinions and instructions\r\nthat are to undergo no alteration. I am, indeed, endeavouring to teach\r\nothers; but I am myself only a learner. Experience will, doubtless, make\r\nme much more perfect in a knowledge of the several parts of the subject;\r\nand the fruit of this experience I shall be careful to communicate to the\r\npublic.\" I now proceed to make good this promise. Experience has proved\r\nthat very beautiful and very fine plat can be made of the straw of divers\r\nkinds of _grass_. But the most ample experience has also proved to us that\r\nit is to the straw of _wheat_, that we are to look for a manufacture to\r\nsupplant the Leghorn. This was mentioned as a strong suspicion in my\r\nformer edition of this work. And I urged my readers to sow wheat for the\r\npurpose. The fact is now proved beyond all contradiction, that the straw\r\nof wheat or rye, but particularly of wheat, is the straw for this purpose.\r\n_Finer_ plat may be made from the straw of grass than can possibly be made\r\nfrom the straw of wheat or rye: but the grass plat is, all of it, more or\r\nless _brittle_; and none of it has the beautiful and uniform colour of the\r\nstraw of wheat. Since the last edition of this work, I have received\r\npackets of the straw _from Tuscany_, all of _wheat_; and, indeed, I am\r\n_convinced_ that no other straw is any-thing like so well calculated for\r\nthe purpose. Wheat straw bleaches better than any other. It has that fine,\r\npale, golden colour which no other straw has; it is much more simple, more\r\npliant than any other straw; and, in short, this is the material. I did\r\nnot urge in vain. A good quantity of wheat was sowed for this purpose. A\r\ngreat deal of it has been well harvested; and I have the pleasure to know\r\nthat several hundreds of persons are now employed in the platting of\r\nstraw. One more year; one more crop of wheat; and another Leghorn bonnet\r\nwill never be imported in England. Some great errors have been committed\r\nin the sowing of the wheat, and in the cutting of it. I shall now,\r\ntherefore, availing myself of the experience which I have gained, offer to\r\nthe public some observations on the _sort of wheat_ to be sowed for this\r\npurpose; on the _season_ for sowing; on the _land_ to be used for the\r\npurpose; on the _quantity of seed_, and the _manner_ of sowing: on the\r\n_season_ for cutting; on the manner of _cutting_, _bleaching_, and\r\n_housing_; on the _platting_; on the _knitting_, and on the _pressing_.\r\n\r\n224. The SORT OF WHEAT. The Leghorn plat is all made of the straw of the\r\nspring wheat. This spring wheat is so called by us, because it is sowed in\r\nthe spring, at the same time that barley is sowed. The botanical name of\r\nit is TRITICUM AESTIVUM. It is a small-grained bearded wheat. It has very\r\nfine straw; but experience has convinced me, that the little brown-grained\r\nwinter wheat is just as good for the purpose. In short, any wheat will do.\r\nI have now in my possession specimens of plat made of both winter and\r\nspring wheat, and I see no difference at all. I am decidedly of opinion\r\nthat the winter wheat is as good as the spring wheat for the purpose. I\r\nhave plat, and I have straw both now before me, and the above is the\r\nresult of my experience.\r\n\r\n225. THE LAND PROPER FOR THE GROWING OF WHEAT. The object is to have the\r\nstraw as small as we can get it. The land must not, therefore, be too\r\nrich; yet it ought not to be _very poor_. If it be, you get the straw of\r\nno length. I saw an acre this year, as beautiful as possible, sowed upon a\r\nlight loam, which bore last year a fine crop of potatoes. The land ought\r\nto be perfectly clean, at any rate; so that, when the crop is taken off,\r\nthe wheat straw may not be mixed with weeds and grass.\r\n\r\n226. SEASON FOR SOWING. This will be more conveniently stated in paragraph\r\n228.\r\n\r\n227. QUANTITY OF SEED AND MANNER OF SOWING. When first this subject was\r\nstarted in 1821, I said, in the Register, that I would engage to grow as\r\nfine straw in England as the Italians could grow. I recommended then, as a\r\nfirst guess, _fifteen_ bushels of wheat to the acre. Since that,\r\nreflection told me that that was not quite enough. I therefore recommended\r\n_twenty_ bushels to the acre. Upon the beautiful acre which I have\r\nmentioned above, eighteen bushels, I am told, were sowed; fine and\r\nbeautiful as it was, I think it would have been better if it had had\r\ntwenty bushels; twenty bushels, therefore, is what I recommend. You must\r\nsow broad cast, of course, and you must take great pains to cover the seed\r\nwell. It must be a good even-handed seedsman, and there must be very nice\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\n228. SEASON FOR CUTTING. Now, mind, it is fit to cut in just about one\r\nweek _after the bloom has dropped_. If you examine the ear at that time,\r\nyou will find the grain just beginning to be formed, and that is precisely\r\nthe time to cut the wheat: The straw has then got its full substance in\r\nit. But I must now point out a very material thing. It is by no means\r\ndesirable to have _all_ your wheat _fit to cut at the same time_. It is a\r\ngreat misfortune, indeed, so to have it. If fit to cut altogether, it\r\nought to be cut all at the same time; for supposing you to have an acre,\r\nit will require a fortnight or three weeks to cut it and bleach it, unless\r\nyou have a very great number of hands, and very great vessels to prepare\r\nwater in. Therefore, if I were to have an acre of wheat for this, purpose,\r\nand were to sow all spring wheat, I would sow a twelfth part of the acre\r\nevery week from the first week in March to the last week in May. If I\r\nrelied partly upon winter wheat, I would sow some every month, from the\r\nlatter end of September to March. If I employed the two sorts of wheat, or\r\nindeed if I employed only the spring wheat, the TRITICUM AESTIVUM, I should\r\nhave some wheat fit to cut in June, and some not fit to cut till\r\nSeptember. I should be sure to have a fair chance as to the weather. And,\r\nin short, it would be next to impossible for me to fail of securing a\r\nconsiderable part of my crop. I beg the reader's particular attention to\r\nthe contents of this paragraph.\r\n\r\n229. MANNER OF CUTTING THE WHEAT. It is cut by a little reap-hook, close\r\nto the ground as possible. It is then tied in little sheaves, with two\r\npieces of string, one near the butt, and the other about half-way up. This\r\nlittle bundle or sheaf ought to be six inches through at the butt, and no\r\nmore. It ought not to be tied too tightly, lest the scalding should not be\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n230. MANNER OF BLEACHING. The little sheaves mentioned in the last\r\nparagraph are carried to a brewing mash, vat, or other tub. You must not\r\nput them into the tub in too large a quantity, lest the water get chilled\r\nbefore it get to the bottom. Pour on scalding water till you cover the\r\nwhole of the little sheaves, and let the water be a foot above the top\r\nsheaves. When the sheaves have remained thus a full quarter of an hour,\r\ntake them out with a prong, lay them in a clothes-basket, or upon a\r\nhurdle, and carry them to the ground where the bleaching is to be\r\nfinished. This should be, if possible, a piece of grass land, where the\r\ngrass is very short. Take the sheaves, and lay some of them along in a\r\nrow; untie them, and lay the straw along in that row as thin as it can\r\npossibly be laid. If it were possible, no one straw ought to have another\r\nlying upon it, or across it. If the sun be clear, it will require to lie\r\ntwenty-four hours thus, then to be turned, and lie twenty-four hours on\r\nthe other side. If the sun be not very clear, it must lie longer. But the\r\nnumerous sowings which I have mentioned will afford you so many chances,\r\nso many opportunities of having fine weather, that the risk about weather\r\nwould necessarily be very small. If wet weather should come, and if your\r\nstraw remain out in it any length of time, it will be spoiled; but,\r\naccording to the mode of sowing above pointed out, you really could stand\r\nvery little chance of losing straw by bad weather. If you had some straw\r\nout bleaching, and the weather were to appear suddenly to be about to\r\nchange, the quantity that you would have out would not be large enough to\r\nprevent you from putting it under cover, and keeping it there till the\r\nweather changed.\r\n\r\n231. HOUSING THE STRAW. When your straw is nicely bleached, gather it up,\r\nand with the same string that you used to tie it when green, tie it up\r\nagain into little sheaves. Put it by in some room where there is no\r\n_damp_, and where mice and rats are not suffered to inhabit. Here it is\r\nalways ready for use, and it will keep, I dare say, four or five years\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\n232. THE PLATTING. This is now so well understood that nothing need be\r\nsaid about the manner of doing the work. But much might be said about the\r\nmeasures to be pursued by land-owners, by parish officers, by farmers, and\r\nmore especially by gentlemen and ladies of sense, public spirit, and\r\nbenevolence of disposition. The thing will be done; the manufacture will\r\nspread itself all over this kingdom; but the exertions of those whom I\r\nhave here pointed out might hasten the period of its being brought to\r\nperfection. And I beg such gentlemen and ladies to reflect on the vast\r\nimportance of such manufacture, which it is impossible to cause to produce\r\nany-thing but good. One of the great misfortunes of England at this day\r\nis, that the land has had _taken away from it those employments for its\r\nwomen and children which were so necessary to the well-being of the\r\nagricultural labourer_. The spinning, the carding, the reeling, the\r\nknitting; these have been all taken away from the land, and given to the\r\nLords of the Loom, the haughty lords of bands of abject slaves. But let\r\nthe landholder mark how the change has operated to produce his ruin. He\r\nmust have the labouring MAN and the labouring BOY; but, alas! he cannot\r\nhave these, without having the man's wife, and the boy's mother, and\r\nlittle sisters and brothers. Even Nature herself says, that he shall have\r\nthe wife and little children, or that he shall not have the man and the\r\nboy. But the Lords of the Loom, the crabbed-voiced, hard-favoured,\r\nhard-hearted, puffed-up, insolent, savage and bloody wretches of the North\r\nhave, assisted by a blind and greedy Government, taken all the employment\r\naway from the agricultural women and children. This manufacture of Straw\r\nwill form one little article of employment for these persons. It sets at\r\ndefiance all the hatching and scheming of all the tyrannical wretches who\r\ncause the poor little creatures to die in their factories, heated to\r\neighty-four degrees. There will need no inventions of WATT; none of your\r\nhorse powers, nor water powers; no murdering of one set of wretches in the\r\ncoal mines, to bring up the means of murdering another set of wretches in\r\nthe factories, by the heat produced from those coals; none of these are\r\nwanted to carry on this manufactory. It wants no _combination_ laws; none\r\nof the inventions of the hard-hearted wretches of the North.\r\n\r\n233. THE KNITTING. Upon this subject, I have only to congratulate my\r\nreaders that there are great numbers of English women who can now knit,\r\nplat together, better than those famous Jewesses of whom we were told.\r\n\r\n234. THE PRESSING. Bonnets and hats are pressed after they are made. I am\r\ntold that a proper press costs pretty nearly a hundred pounds; but, then,\r\nthat it will do prodigious deal of business. I would recommend to our\r\nfriends in the country to teach as many children as they can to make the\r\nplat. The plat will be knitted in London, and in other considerable towns,\r\nby persons to whom it will be sold. It appears to me, at least, that this\r\nwill be the course that the thing will take. However, we must leave this\r\nto time; and here I conclude my observations upon a subject which is\r\ndeeply interesting to myself, and which the public in general deem to be\r\nof great importance.\r\n\r\n235. POSTSCRIPT on _brewing_.--I think it right to say here, that, ever\r\nsince I published the instructions for brewing by copper and by wooden\r\nutensils, the beer at _my own house_ has always been brewed precisely\r\nagreeable to the instructions contained in this book; and I have to add,\r\nthat I never have had such good beer in my house in all my lifetime, as\r\nsince I have followed that mode of brewing. My table-beer, as well as my\r\nale, is always as clear as wine. I have had hundreds and hundreds of\r\nquarters of malt brewed into beer in my house. My people could always make\r\nit strong enough and sweet enough; but never, except by accident, could\r\nthey make it CLEAR. Now I never have any that is not clear. And yet my\r\nutensils are all very small; and my brewers are sometimes one labouring\r\nman, and sometimes another. A man wants showing how to brew the first\r\ntime. I should suppose that we use, in my house, about seven hundred\r\ngallons of beer every year, taking both sorts together; and I can\r\npositively assert, that there has not been one drop of bad beer, and\r\nindeed none which has not been most excellent, in my house, during the\r\nlast two years, I think it is, since I began using the utensils, and in\r\nthe manner named in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nICE-HOUSES.\r\n\r\n236. First begging the reader to read again paragraph 149, I proceed here,\r\nin compliance with numerous requests to that effect, to describe, as\r\nclearly as I can, the manner of constructing the sort of Ice-houses\r\ntherein mentioned. In England, these receptacles of frozen water are,\r\ngenerally, _under ground_, and always, if possible, under the _shade of\r\ntrees_, the opinion being, that the _main_ thing, if not the _only_ thing,\r\nis to keep away _the heat_. The heat is to be kept away certainly; but\r\n_moisture_ is the great enemy of _Ice_; and how is this to be kept away\r\neither _under ground_, or under the shade of trees? Abundant experience\r\nhas proved, that no thickness of _wall_, that no cement of any kind, will\r\neffectually resist _moisture_. Drops will, at times, be seen hanging on\r\nthe under side of an arch of any thickness, and made of any materials, if\r\nit have earth over it, and even when it has the floor of a house over it;\r\nand wherever the moisture enters, the ice will quickly melt.\r\n\r\n237. Ice-houses should therefore be, in all their parts, _as dry_ as\r\npossible: and they should be so constructed, and the ice so deposited in\r\nthem, as to ensure _the running away of the meltings_ as quickly as\r\npossible, whenever such meltings come. Any-thing in way of drains or\r\ngutters, is too slow in its effect; and therefore there must be something\r\nthat will not suffer the water proceeding from any melting, to remain an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n238. In the first place, then, the ice-house should stand in a place quite\r\nopen to the _sun and air_; for whoever has travelled even but a few miles\r\n(having eyes in his head) need not be told how long that part of a road\r\nfrom which the sun and wind are excluded by trees, or hedges, or by\r\nany-thing else, will remain wet, or at least damp, after the rest of the\r\nroad is even in a state to send up dust.\r\n\r\n239. The next thing is to protect the ice against wet, or damp, from\r\n_beneath_. It should, therefore, stand on some spot _from which water\r\nwould run in every direction_; and if the natural ground presents no such\r\nspot, it is no very great job to _make it_.\r\n\r\n240. Then come the _materials_ of which the house is to consist. These,\r\nfor the reasons before-mentioned, must not be bricks, stones, mortar, nor\r\nearth; for these are all affected by the atmosphere; they will become\r\n_damp_ at certain times, and _dampness_ is the great destroyer of ice. The\r\nmaterials are _wood_ and _straw_. Wood will not do; for, though not liable\r\nto become damp, it imbibes _heat_ fast enough; and, besides, it cannot be\r\nso put together as to shut out air sufficiently. Straw is wholly free from\r\nthe quality of becoming damp, except from water actually put upon it; and\r\nit can, at the same time, be placed on a roof, and on sides, to such a\r\ndegree of thickness as to exclude the air in a manner the most perfect.\r\nThe ice-house ought, therefore, to be made of _posts, plates, rafters,\r\nlaths, and straw_. The best form is the _circular_; and the house, when\r\nmade, appears as I have endeavoured to describe it in _Fig. 3_ of the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n241. FIG. 1, _a_, is the centre of a circle, the diameter of which is ten\r\nfeet, and at this centre you put up a post to stand fifteen feet above the\r\nlevel of the ground, which post ought to be about nine inches through at\r\nthe bottom, and not a great deal smaller at the top. Great care must be\r\ntaken that this post be _perfectly perpendicular_; for, if it be not, the\r\nwhole building will be awry.\r\n\r\n242. _b b b_ are fifteen posts, nine feet high, and six inches through at\r\nthe bottom, without much tapering towards the top. These posts stand about\r\ntwo feet apart, reckoning from centre of post to centre of post, which\r\nleaves between each two a space of eighteen inches, _c c c c_ are\r\nfifty-four posts, five feet high, and five inches through at the bottom,\r\nwithout much tapering towards the top. These posts stand about two feet\r\napart, from centre of post to centre of post, which leaves between each\r\ntwo a space of nineteen inches. The space between these two rows of posts\r\nis four feet in width, and, as will be presently seen, is to contain _a\r\nwall of straw_.\r\n\r\n243. _e_ is a passage through this wall; _d_ is the outside door of the\r\npassage; _f_ is the inside door; and the inner circle, of which _a_ is the\r\ncentre, is the place in which the ice is to be deposited.\r\n\r\n244. Well, then, we have now got _the posts_ up; and, before we talk of\r\nthe _roof_ of the house, or of the _bed_ for the ice, it will be best to\r\nspeak about the making of the _wall_. It is to be made of _straw_,\r\nwheat-straw, or rye-straw, with no rubbish in it, and made very smooth by\r\nthe hand as it is put in. You lay it _in very closely_ and very smoothly,\r\nso that if the wall were cut across, as at _g g_, in FIG. 2 (which FIG.\r\n2 represents _the whole building cut down through the middle_, omitting\r\nthe centre post,) the ends of the straws would present a compact face as\r\nthey do after a cut of a chaff-cutter. But there requires something _to\r\nkeep the straw from bulging out between the posts_. Little stakes as big\r\nas your _wrist_ will answer this purpose. Drive them into the ground, and\r\nfasten, at top, to the _plates_, of which I am now to speak. The plates\r\nare pieces of wood which go all round both the circles, and are _nailed on\r\nupon the tops of the posts_. Their main business is to receive and sustain\r\nthe _lower ends of the rafters_, as at _m m_ and _n n_ in FIG. 2. But to\r\nthe plates also the _stakes_ just mentioned must be fastened at top. Thus,\r\nthen, there will be this space of four feet wide, having, on each side of\r\nit, a row of posts and stakes, not more than about six inches from each\r\nother, to hold up, and to keep in its place, this wall of straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1_, _Fig. 2_, _Fig. 3_]\r\n\r\n\r\n245. Next come the _rafters_, as from _s_ to _n_, FIG. 2. Carpenters best\r\nknow what is the _number_ and what the _size_ of the rafters; but from _s_\r\nto _m_ there need be only about half as many as from _m_ to _n_. However,\r\ncarpenters know all about this. It is their every-day work. The roof is\r\nforty-five _degrees pitch_, as the carpenters call it. If it were even\r\n_sharper_, it would be none the worse. There will be about _thirty_ ends\r\nof rafters to lodge on the plate, as at _m_; and these cannot _all_ be\r\nfastened to the top of the centre-post rising up from _a_; but carpenters\r\nknow how to manage this matter, so as to make all strong and safe. The\r\n_plate_ which goes along on the tops of the row of posts, _b b b_, must,\r\nof course, be put on in a somewhat sloping form; otherwise there would be\r\na sort of _hip_ formed by the rafters. However, the thatch is to be so\r\ndeep, that this may not be of much consequence. Before the thatching\r\nbegins, there are _laths_ to put upon the rafters. Thatchers know all\r\nabout this, and all that you have to do is, to take care that the thatcher\r\n_tie the straw on well_. The best way, in a case of such deep thatch, is\r\nto have _a strong man to tie for the thatcher_.\r\n\r\n246. The roof is now _raftered_, and it is to receive a thatch of _clean_,\r\n_sound_, and well-prepared wheat or rye straw, four _feet thick_, as at _h\r\nh_ in FIG. 2.\r\n\r\n247. The house having now got _walls_ and _roof_, the next thing is to\r\nmake the _bed_ to receive the ice. This bed is the area of the circle of\r\nwhich _a_ is the centre. You begin by laying on the ground _round logs_,\r\neight inches through, or thereabouts, and placing them across the area,\r\nleaving spaces between them of about a foot. Then, _crossways on them_,\r\npoles about four inches through, placed at six inches apart. Then,\r\n_crossways on them_, other poles, about two inches through, placed at\r\nthree inches apart. Then, _crossways on them_, rods as thick as your\r\nfinger, placed at an inch apart. Then upon these, small, clean, dry,\r\nlast-winter-cut _twigs_, to the thickness of about two inches; or, instead\r\nof these twigs, good, clean, strong _heath_, free from grass and moss, and\r\nfrom rubbish of all sorts.\r\n\r\n248. This is the _bed_ for the ice to lie on; and as you see, the top of\r\nthe bed will be seventeen inches from the ground. The pressure of the ice\r\nmay, perhaps, bring it to fourteen, or to thirteen. Upon this bed the ice\r\nis put, broken and pummelled, and beaten down together in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n249. Having got the bed filled with ice, we have next to _shut it safely\r\nup_. As we have seen, there is a passage (_e_). Two feet wide is enough\r\nfor this passage; and, being as long as the wall is thick, it is of\r\ncourse, four feet long. The use of the passage is this: that you may have\r\n_two doors_, so that you may, in hot or damp weather, shut the outer door,\r\nwhile you have the inner door open. This inner door may be of hurdle-work,\r\nand straw, and covered, on one of the sides, with sheep-skins with the\r\n_wool on_, so as to keep out the external air. The outer-door, which must\r\nlock, must be of wood, made to shut very closely, and, besides, covered\r\nwith skins like the other. At times of great danger from heat, or from\r\nwet, the whole of the passage may be filled with straw. The door (_p._\r\nFIG. 3) should face the North, or between North and East.\r\n\r\n250. As to the _size_ of the ice-house, that must, of course, depend upon\r\nthe _quantity_ of ice that you may choose to have. A house on the above\r\nscale, is from _w_ to _x_ (FIG. 2) twenty-nine feet; from _y_ to _z_ (FIG.\r\n2) nineteen feet. The area of the circle, of which _a_ is the centre, is\r\nten feet in diameter, and as this area contains seventy-five superficial\r\nfeet, you will, if you put ice on the bed to the height of only five feet,\r\n(and you _may_ put it on to the height of seven feet from the top of the\r\nbed,) you will have _three hundred and seventy-five cubic feet of ice_;\r\nand, observe, a cubic foot of ice will, when broken up, fill much more\r\nthan a _Winchester Bushel_: what it may do as to an \"IMPERIAL BUSHEL,\"\r\nengendered like Greek Loan Commissioners, by the unnatural heat of\r\n\"PROSPERITY,\" God only knows! However, I do suppose, that, without making\r\nany allowance for the \"_cold_ fit,\" as Dr. Baring calls it, into which\r\n\"_late_ panic\" has brought us; I do suppose, that even the scorching, the\r\nburning dog-star of \"IMPERIAL PROSPERITY;\" nay, that even DIVES himself,\r\nwould hardly call for more than two bushels of ice in a day; for more than\r\ntwo bushels a day it would be, unless it were used in cold as well as in\r\nhot weather.\r\n\r\n251. As to the _expense_ of such a house, it could, in the country, not be\r\nmuch. None of the posts, except the main or centre-post, need be _very\r\nstraight_. The other posts might be easily culled from tree-lops, destined\r\nfor fire-wood. The straw would _make all straight_. The _plates_ must of\r\nnecessity be short pieces of wood; and, as to the _stakes_, the _laths_,\r\nand the _logs_, _poles_, _rods_, _twigs_, and _heath_, they would not all\r\ncost _twenty shillings_. The straw is the principal article; and, in most\r\nplaces, even that would not cost more than two or three pounds. If it last\r\nmany years, the price could not be an object; and if but a little while,\r\nit would still be nearly as good for litter as it was before it was\r\napplied to this purpose. How often the _bottom of the straw walls_ might\r\nwant renewing I cannot say, but I know that the roof would with few and\r\nsmall repairs, last well for ten years.\r\n\r\n252. I have said that the interior row of posts is to be nine feet high,\r\nand the exterior row five feet high. I, in each case, mean, _with the\r\nplate inclusive_. I have only to add, that by way of superabundant\r\nprecaution against bottom wet, it will be well to make a sort of _gutter_,\r\nto receive the drip from the roof, and to carry it away as soon as it\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\n253. Now, after expressing a hope that I shall have made myself clearly\r\nunderstood by every reader, it is necessary that I remind him, that I do\r\nnot pretend to pledge myself for the complete success, nor for any success\r\nat all, of this mode of making ice-houses. But, at the same time, I\r\nexpress my firm belief, that complete success would attend it; because it\r\nnot only corresponds with what I have seen of such matters; but I had the\r\ndetails from a gentleman who had ample experience to guide him, and who\r\nwas a man on whose word and judgment I placed a perfect reliance. He\r\nadvised me to erect an ice-house; but not caring enough about _fresh meat_\r\nand _fish_ in summer, or at least not setting them enough above \"_prime\r\npork_\" to induce me to take any trouble to secure the former, I never\r\nbuilt an ice-house. Thus, then, I only communicate that in which I\r\nbelieve; there is, however, in all cases, this comfort, that if the thing\r\nfail as an ice-house, it will serve all generations to come as a model for\r\na pig-bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITION.\r\n\r\n_Kensington, Nov. 14th, 1831._\r\n\r\nMANGEL WURZEL.\r\n\r\n254. This last summer, I have proved that, as keep for cows, MANGEL WURZEL\r\nis preferable to SWEDISH TURNIPS, whether as to quantity or quality. But\r\nthere needs no other alteration in the book, than merely to read _mangel\r\nwurzel_ wherever you find _Swedish turnip_; the time of sowing, the mode\r\nand time of transplanting, the distances, and the cultivation, all being\r\nthe same; and the only difference being in the _application of the\r\nleaves_, and in _the time of harvesting_ the roots.\r\n\r\n255. The leaves of the MANGEL WURZEL are of great value, especially in dry\r\nsummers. You begin, about the third week in August, to take off by a\r\n_downward pull_, the leaves of the plants; and they are excellent food for\r\npigs and cows; only observe this, that, if given to cows, there must be,\r\nfor each cow, _six pounds of hay a day_, which is not necessary in the\r\ncase of the Swedish turnips. These leaves last till the crop is taken up,\r\nwhich ought to be in the _first week of November_. The taking off of the\r\nleaves does good to the plants: new leaves succeed higher up; and the\r\nplant becomes _longer_ than it otherwise would be, and, of course,\r\n_heavier_. But, in taking off the leaves, you must not approach too near\r\nto the top.\r\n\r\n256. When you take the plants up in November, you must cut off the\r\n_crowns_ and the remaining leaves; and they, again, are for cows and pigs.\r\nThen you put the roots into some place to keep them from the frost; and,\r\nif you have no place under cover, put them in _pies_, in the same manner\r\nas directed for the Swedish turnips. The roots will average in weight 10\r\n_lbs. each_. They may be given to cows _whole_, or to pigs either, and\r\nthey are better than the Swedish turnip for both animals; and they do not\r\ngive any bad or strong taste to the milk and butter. But, besides this use\r\nof the mangel wurzel, there is another, with regard to pigs at least, of\r\nvery great importance. The _juice_ of this plant has so much of\r\n_sweetness_ in it, that, in France, they make _sugar_ of it; and have used\r\nthe sugar, and found it equal in goodness to West India sugar. Many\r\npersons in England make _beer_ of this juice, and I have drunk of this\r\nbeer, and found it very good. In short, the juice is most excellent for\r\nthe mixing of moist food for pigs. I am now (20th Nov. 1831) boiling it\r\nfor this purpose. My copper holds seven strike-bushels; I put in three\r\nbushels of mangel wurzel cut into pieces two inches thick, and then fill\r\nthe copper with water. I draw off as much of the liquor as I want to wet\r\npollard, or meal, for little pigs or fatting-pigs, and the rest, roots and\r\nall, I feed the _yard-hogs_ with; and this I shall follow on till about\r\nthe middle of May.\r\n\r\n257. If you give boiled, or steamed, _potatoes_ to pigs, there wants some\r\nliquor to mix with the potatoes; for the water in which potatoes have been\r\nboiled is _hurtful_ to any animal that drinks it. But mix the potatoes\r\nwith juice of mangel wurzel, and they make very good food for hogs of all\r\nages. The mangel wurzel produces _a larger_ crop than the Swedish turnip.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBBETT'S CORN.\r\n\r\n258. IF you prefer _bread_ and _pudding_ to milk, butter, and meat, this\r\ncorn will produce, on your forty rods, forty bushels, each weighing 60\r\n_lbs. at the least_; and more flour, in proportion, than the best white\r\nwheat. To make _bread_ with it you must use _two-thirds_ wheaten, or rye,\r\nflour; but in puddings this is not necessary. The puddings at my house are\r\nall made with this flour, except meat and fruit pudding; for the corn\r\nflour is not adhesive or _clinging_ enough to make paste, or crust. This\r\ncorn is the very best for hog-fatting in the whole world. I, last April,\r\nsent parcels of the seed into several counties, to be given away to\r\nworking men: and I sent them instructions for the cultivation, which I\r\nshall repeat here.\r\n\r\n259. I will first describe this _corn_ to you. It is that which is\r\nsometimes called _Indian corn_; and sometimes people call it Indian wheat.\r\nIt is that sort of corn which the disciples ate as they were going up to\r\nJerusalem on the Sabbath-day. They gathered it in the fields as they went\r\nalong and ate it green, they being \"an hungered,\" for which you know they\r\nwere reproved by the pharisees. I have written a treatise on this corn in\r\na book which I sell for four shillings, giving a minute account of the\r\nqualities, the culture, the harvesting, and the various uses of this corn;\r\nbut I shall here confine myself to what is necessary for a labourer to\r\nknow about it, so that he may be induced to raise and may be enabled to\r\nraise enough of it in his garden to fat a pig of ten score.\r\n\r\n260. There are a great many sorts of this corn. They all come from\r\ncountries which are hotter than England. This sort, which my eldest son\r\nbrought into England, is a dwarf kind, and is the only kind that I have\r\nknown to ripen in this country: and I know that it will ripen in this\r\ncountry in any summer; for I had a large field of it in 1828 and 1829; and\r\nlast year (my lease at my farm being out at Michaelmas, and this corn not\r\nripening till late in October) I had about two acres in my garden at\r\nKensington. Within the memory of man there have not been three summers so\r\ncold as the last, one after another; and no one so cold as the last. Yet\r\nmy corn ripened perfectly well, and this you will be satisfied of if you\r\nbe amongst the men to whom this corn is given from me. You will see that\r\nit is in the shape of the cone of a spruce fir; you will see that the\r\ngrains are fixed round a stalk which is called the _cob_. These _stalks_\r\nor _ears_ come out of the side of the plant, which has leaves like a flag,\r\nwhich plant grows to about three feet high, and has two or three and\r\nsometimes more, of these ears or bunches of grain. Out of the top of the\r\nplant comes the tassel, which resembles the plumes of feathers upon a\r\nhearse; and this is the flower of the plant.\r\n\r\n261. The grain is, as you will see, about the size of a large pea, and\r\nthere are from two to three hundred of these grains upon the ear, or cob.\r\nIn my treatise, I have shown that, in America, all the hogs and pigs, all\r\nthe poultry of every sort, the greater part of the oxen, and a\r\nconsiderable part of the sheep, are fatted upon this corn; that it is the\r\nbest food for horses; and that, when ground and dressed in various ways,\r\nit is used in bread, in puddings, in several other ways in families; and\r\nthat, in short, it is the real staff of life, in all the countries where\r\nit is in common culture, and where the climate is hot. When used for\r\npoultry, the grain is rubbed off the cob. Horses, sheep, and pigs, bite\r\nthe grain off, and leave the cob; but horned cattle eat cob and all.\r\n\r\n262. I am to speak of it to you, however, only as a thing to make you some\r\nbacon, for which use it surpasses all other grain whatsoever. When the\r\ngrain is in the whole ear, it is called corn in the ear; when it is rubbed\r\noff the cob, it is called shelled corn. Now, observe, ten bushels of\r\nshelled corn are equal, in the fatting of a pig, to fifteen bushels of\r\nbarley; and fifteen bushels of barley, if properly ground and managed,\r\nwill make a pig of ten score, if he be not too poor when you begin to fat\r\nhim. Observe that everybody who has been in America knows, that the finest\r\nhogs in the world are fatted in that country; and no man ever saw a hog\r\nfatted in that country in any other way than tossing the ears of corn over\r\nto him in the sty, leaving him to bite it off the ear, and deal with it\r\naccording to his pleasure. The finest and solidest bacon in the world is\r\nproduced in this way.\r\n\r\n263. Now, then, I know, that a bushel of shelled corn may be grown upon\r\none single rod of ground sixteen feet and a half each way; I have grown\r\nmore than that this last summer; and any of you may do the same if you\r\nwill strictly follow the instructions which I am now about to give you.\r\n\r\n1. Late in March (I am doing it now,) or in the first fortnight of April,\r\ndig your ground up _very deep_, and let it lie rough till between the\r\nseventh and fifteenth of May.\r\n\r\n2. Then (in dry weather if possible) dig up the ground again, and make it\r\nsmooth at top. Draw drills with a line two feet apart, just as you do\r\ndrills for peas; rub the grains off the cob; put a little very rotten and\r\nfine manure along the bottom of the drill; lay the grains along upon that\r\nsix inches apart; cover the grain over with fine earth, so that there be\r\nabout an inch and a half on the top of the grain; pat the earth down a\r\nlittle with the back of a hoe to make it lie solid on the grain.\r\n\r\n3. If there be any danger of slugs, you must kill them before the corn\r\ncomes up if possible: and the best way to do this is to put a little hot\r\nlime in a bag, and go very early in the morning, and shake the bag all\r\nround the edges of the ground and over the ground. Doing this three or\r\nfour times very early in a dewy morning, or just after a shower, will\r\ndestroy all the slugs; and this ought to be done for all other crops as\r\nwell as for that of corn.\r\n\r\n4. When the corn comes up, you must take care to keep all birds off till\r\nit is two or three inches high; for the spear is so sweet, that the birds\r\nof all sorts are very apt to peck it off, particularly the doves and the\r\nlarks and pigeons. As soon as it is fairly above ground, give the whole of\r\nthe ground (in dry weather) a flat hoeing, and be sure to move all the\r\nground close round the plants. When the weeds begin to appear again, give\r\nthe ground another hoeing, but always in dry weather. When the plants get\r\nto be about a foot high or a little more, dig the ground between the rows,\r\nand work the earth up a little against the stems of the plants.\r\n\r\n5. About the middle of August you will see the tassel springing up out of\r\nthe middle of the plant, and the ears coming out of the sides. If weeds\r\nappear in the ground, hoe it again to kill the weeds, so that the ground\r\nmay be always kept clean. About the middle of September you will find the\r\ngrains of the ears to be full of milk, just in the state that the ears\r\nwere at Jerusalem when the disciples cropped them to eat. From this milky\r\nstate, they, like the grains of wheat, grow hard; and as soon as the\r\ngrains begin to be hard, you should cut off the tops of the corn and the\r\nlong flaggy leaves, and leave the ears to ripen upon the stalk or stem. If\r\nit be a warm summer, they will be fit to harvest by the last of October;\r\nbut it does not signify if they remain out until the middle of November or\r\neven later. The longer they stay out, the harder the grain will be.\r\n\r\n6. Each ear is covered in a very curious manner with a husk. The best way\r\nfor you will be, when you gather in your crop to strip off the husks, to\r\ntie the ears in bunches of six or eight or ten, and to hang them up to\r\nnails in the walls, or against the beams of your house; for there is so\r\nmuch moisture in the cob that the ears are apt to heat if put together in\r\ngreat parcels. The room in which I write in London is now hung all round\r\nwith bunches of this corn. The bunches may be hung up in a shed or stable\r\nfor a while, and, when perfectly dry, they may be put into bags.\r\n\r\n7. Now, as to the mode of _using_ the corn; if for poultry, you must rub\r\nthe grains off the cob; but if for pigs, give them the whole ears. You\r\nwill find some of the ears in which the grain is still soft. Give these to\r\nyour pig first; and keep the hardest to the last. You will soon see how\r\nmuch the pig will require in a day, because pigs, more decent than many\r\nrich men, never eat any more than is necessary to them. You will thus have\r\na pig; you will have two flitches of bacon, two pig's cheeks, one set of\r\nsouse, two griskins, two spare-ribs, from both which I trust in God you\r\nwill keep the jaws of the Methodist parson; and if, while you are drinking\r\na mug of your own ale, after having dined upon one of these, you drink my\r\nhealth, you may be sure that it will give you more merit in the sight of\r\nGod as well as of man, than you would acquire by groaning the soul out of\r\nyour body in responses to the blasphemous cant of the sleekheaded\r\nMethodist thief that would persuade you to live upon potatoes.\r\n\r\n264. You must be quite sensible that I cannot have any motive but your\r\ngood in giving you this advice, other than the delight which I take and\r\nthe pleasure which I derive from doing that good. You are all personally\r\nunknown to me: in all human probability not one man in a thousand will\r\never see me. You have no more power to show your gratitude to me than you\r\nhave to cause me to live for a hundred years. I do not desire that you\r\nshould deem this a favour received from me. The thing is worth your\r\ntrying, at any rate.\r\n\r\n265. The corn is off by the middle of November. The ground should then be\r\nwell manured, and deeply dug, and planted with EARLY YORK, or EARLY DWARF\r\nCABBAGES, which will be _loaved_ in the _latter end of April_, and may be\r\neither sold or given to pigs, or cows, _before the time to plant the corn\r\nagain_. Thus you have two very large crops on the same ground in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     PARAGRAPH\r\n\r\n  Agur                                      18\r\n\r\n  Bees                                     160\r\n\r\n  Bread, making of                          77\r\n\r\n  Brewing Beer                         20, 108\r\n    _See also_ \"POSTSCRIPT.\"\r\n\r\n  Brewing-machine                           41\r\n\r\n  Brougham, Mr.                             41\r\n\r\n  Candles and Rushes                       199\r\n\r\n  Castlereagh's and Mackintosh's Oratory   152\r\n\r\n  Combination Laws                         108\r\n\r\n  Corn, Cobbett                            258\r\n\r\n  Cows, keeping                            111\r\n\r\n  Cusar, Mr.                                86\r\n\r\n  Custom Laws                              108\r\n\r\n  Drennen, Dr.                              80\r\n\r\n  Dress, Household Goods, and Fuel         199\r\n\r\n  Ducks                                    169\r\n\r\n  Economy, meaning of the term            2, 3\r\n\r\n  Education                                 11\r\n\r\n  Ellman, Mr.                           20, 60\r\n\r\n  Excise Laws                              108\r\n\r\n  Fowls                                    176\r\n\r\n  Geese                                    167\r\n\r\n  Goats and Ewes                           189\r\n\r\n  Hanning, Mr. Wm.                          99\r\n\r\n  Hill, Mr.                                 98\r\n\r\n  Hops                                     202\r\n\r\n  Ice-houses                               236\r\n\r\n  Leghorn                                  212\r\n\r\n  Libel Laws                               108\r\n\r\n  Malthus, Parson                          141\r\n\r\n  Mangel Wurzel                            254\r\n\r\n  Mustard                                  198\r\n\r\n  Parks, Mr.                                98\r\n\r\n  Paul, Saint                              148\r\n\r\n  Peel's flimsy Dresses                    152\r\n\r\n  Pigeons                                  181\r\n\r\n  Pigs, keeping                            139\r\n\r\n  Pitt's false Money                       152\r\n\r\n  Plat, English Straw                      208\r\n\r\n  Porter, how to make                       71\r\n\r\n  Potatoes                                  77\r\n\r\n  Rabbits                                  184\r\n\r\n  Salting Mutton and Beef                  157\r\n\r\n  Stanhope, Lord                           144\r\n\r\n  Swedish Turnips                          207\r\n\r\n  Turkeys                                  171\r\n\r\n  Walter's and Stoddart's Paragraphs       152\r\n\r\n  Walter Scott's Poems                     152\r\n\r\n  Want, the Parent of Crime                 18\r\n\r\n  Wakefield, Mr. Edward                 78, 99\r\n\r\n  Wilberforce's Potatoe-Diet               152\r\n\r\n  Winchelsea, Lord.                        144\r\n\r\n  Woodhouse, Miss                          213\r\n\r\n  Yeast                                    203\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COBBETT'S\r\n  POOR MAN'S FRIEND;\r\n\r\n  A DEFENCE OF THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DO\r\n  THE WORK, AND FIGHT THE BATTLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBBETT'S POOR MAN'S FRIEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER I.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING CLASSES OF PRESTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Burghclere, Hampshire, 22d August, 1826._\r\n\r\nMY EXCELLENT FRIENDS,\r\n\r\n1. Amongst all the new, the strange, the unnatural, the monstrous things\r\nthat mark the present times, or, rather, that have grown out of the\r\npresent system of governing this country, there is, in my opinion, hardly\r\nany thing more monstrous, or even so monstrous, as the language that is\r\nnow become fashionable, relative to the condition and the treatment of\r\nthat part of the community which are usually denominated the POOR; by\r\nwhich word I mean to designate the persons who, from age, infirmity,\r\nhelplessness, or from want of the means of gaining anything by labour,\r\nbecome destitute of a sufficiency of food or of raiment, and are in danger\r\nof perishing if they be not relieved. Such are the persons that we mean\r\nwhen we talk of THE POOR; and, I repeat, that amongst all the monstrous\r\nthings of these monstrous days, nothing is, in my opinion, so monstrous as\r\nthe language which we now constantly hear relative to the condition and\r\ntreatment of this part of the community.\r\n\r\n2. Nothing can be more common than to read, in the newspapers,\r\ndescriptions the most horrible of the sufferings of _the Poor_, in various\r\nparts of England, but particularly in the North. It is related of them,\r\nthat they eat horse-flesh, grains, and have been detected in eating out of\r\npig-troughs. In short, they are represented as being far worse fed and\r\nworse lodged than the greater part of the pigs. These statements of the\r\n_newspapers_ may be false, or, at least, only partially true; but, at a\r\npublic meeting of rate-payers, at Manchester, on the 17th of August, Mr.\r\nBAXTER, the Chairman, said, that some of the POOR had been _starved to\r\ndeath_, and that _tens of thousands were upon the point of starving_; and,\r\nat the same meeting, Mr. POTTER gave a detail, which showed that Mr.\r\nBAXTER'S general description was true. Other accounts, very nearly\r\nofficial, and, at any rate, being of unquestionable authenticity, concur\r\nso fully with the statements made at the Manchester Meeting, that it is\r\nimpossible not to believe, that a great number of thousands of persons are\r\nnow on the point of perishing for want of food, and _that many have\r\nactually perished from that cause_; and that this has taken place, and is\r\ntaking place, IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n3. There is, then, no doubt of the existence of the disgraceful and horrid\r\nfacts; but that which is as horrid as are the facts themselves, and even\r\nmore horrid than those facts, is the cool and _unresentful_ language and\r\nmanner in which the facts are usually spoken of. Those who write about the\r\nmisery and starvation in Lancashire and Yorkshire, never appear to think\r\n_that any body is to blame_, even when the poor die with hunger. The\r\nMinisters ascribe the calamity to \"_over-trading_;\" the cotton and cloth\r\nand other master-manufacturers ascribe it to \"_a want of paper-money_,\" or\r\nto the _Corn-Bill_; others ascribe the calamity to the _taxes_. These last\r\nare right; but what have these things to do with the treatment of the\r\npoor? What have these things to do with the horrid facts relative to the\r\ncondition and starvation of English people? It is very true, that the\r\nenormous taxes which we pay on account of loans made to carry on the late\r\nunjust wars, on account of a great standing army in time of peace, on\r\naccount of pensions, sinecures and grants, and on account of _a Church_,\r\nwhich, besides, swallows up so large a part of the produce of the land\r\nand the labour; it is very true, that these enormous taxes, co-operating\r\nwith the paper-money and its innumerable monopolies; it is very true, that\r\n_these enormous taxes_, thus associated, have produced the ruin in trade,\r\nmanufactures and commerce, and have, of course, produced the _low wages_\r\nand the _want of employment_; this is very true; but it is not less true,\r\nthat, be wages or employment as they may, the poor are not to perish with\r\nhunger, or with cold, while the rest of the community have food and\r\nraiment more than the latter want for their own sustenance. The LAW OF\r\nENGLAND says, that there shall be no person to suffer from want of food\r\nand raiment. It has placed _officers_ in every parish to see that no\r\nperson suffer from this sort of want; and lest these officers should not\r\ndo their duty, _it commands all the magistrates_ to hear the complaints of\r\nthe poor, and to compel the officers to do their duty. The LAW OF ENGLAND\r\nhas provided ample means of relief for the poor; for, it has authorized\r\nthe officers, or overseers, to get from the rich inhabitants of the parish\r\nas much money as _is wanted_ for the purpose, without any limit as to\r\namount; and, in order that the overseers may have no excuse of inability\r\nto make people pay, the law has armed them with powers of a nature the\r\nmost efficacious and the most efficient and most prompt in their\r\noperation. In short, the language of the LAW, to the overseer, is this:\r\n\"Take care that no person suffer from hunger, or from cold; and that you\r\nmay be sure not to fail of the means of obeying this my command, I give\r\nyou, as far as shall be necessary for this purpose, full power over all\r\nthe lands, all the houses, all the goods, and all the cattle, in your\r\nparish.\" To the Justices of the Peace the LAW says: \"Lest the overseer\r\nshould neglect his duty; lest, in spite of my command to him, any one\r\nshould suffer from hunger or cold, I command you to be ready to hear the\r\ncomplaint of every sufferer from such neglect; I command you to summon the\r\noffending overseer, and to compel him to do his duty.\"\r\n\r\n4. Such being the language of the LAW, is it not a monstrous state of\r\nthings, when we hear it commonly and coolly stated, that many thousands of\r\npersons in England are _upon the point of starvation_; that _thousands\r\nwill die of hunger and cold next winter_; that many have _already died of\r\nhunger_; and when we hear all this, unaccompanied with one word of\r\n_complaint against any overseer_, or any _justice of the peace_! Is not\r\nthis state of things perfectly monstrous? A state of things in which it\r\nappears to be taken for granted, that the LAW is nothing, when it is\r\nintended to operate as a protection to the poor! Law is always law: if one\r\npart of the law may be, with impunity, set at defiance, why not another\r\nand every other part of the law? If the law which provides for the succour\r\nof the poor, for the preservation of their lives, may be, with impunity,\r\nset at defiance, why should there not be impunity for setting at defiance\r\nthe law which provides for the security of the property and the lives of\r\nthe rich? If you, in Lancashire, were to read, in an account of a meeting\r\nin Hampshire, that, here, the farmers and gentlemen were constantly and\r\nopenly robbed; that the poor were daily breaking into their houses, and\r\nknocking their brains out; and that it was expected that great part of\r\nthem would be killed very soon: if you, in Lancashire were to hear this\r\nsaid of the state of Hampshire, what would you say? Say! Why, you would\r\nsay, to be sure, \"Where is the LAW; where are the constables, the\r\njustices, the juries, the judges, the sheriffs, and the hangmen? Where can\r\nthat _Hampshire_ be? It, surely, never can be in Old England. It must be\r\nsome savage country, where such enormities can be committed, and where\r\neven those, who talk and who _lament_ the evils, never utter one word in\r\nthe way of _blame_ of the perpetrators.\" And if you were called upon to\r\npay taxes, or to make subscriptions in money, to furnish the means of\r\nprotection to the unfortunate rich people in Hampshire, would you not say,\r\nand with good reason, \"No: what should we do this for? The people of\r\nHampshire have the SAME LAW that we have; they are under the same\r\nGovernment; _let them duly enforce that law_; and then they will stand in\r\nno need of money from us to provide for their protection.\"\r\n\r\n5. This is what common sense says would be _your_ language in such a case;\r\nand does not common sense say, that the people of Hampshire, and of every\r\nother part of England, will thus think, when they are told of the\r\nsufferings, and the starvation, in Lancashire and Yorkshire! The report of\r\nthe Manchester ley-payers, which took place on the 17th of August, reached\r\nme in a friend's house in this little village; and when another friend,\r\nwho was present, read, in the speeches of Mr. BAXTER and Mr. POTTER, that\r\ntens of thousands of Lancashire people were _on the point of starvation_,\r\nand that many had already _actually died from starvation_; and when he\r\nperceived, that even those gentlemen uttered not a word of _complaint_\r\nagainst either overseer or justices of the peace, he exclaimed: \"What! are\r\nthere _no poor-laws_ in Lancashire? Where, amidst all this starvation, is\r\nthe overseer? Where is the justice of the peace? Surely that Lancashire\r\ncan never be _in England_?\"\r\n\r\n6. The observations of this gentleman are those which occur to every man\r\nof sense; when he hears the horrid accounts of the sufferings in the\r\nmanufacturing districts; for, though we are all well aware, that the\r\nburden of the poor-rates presses, at this time, with peculiar weight on\r\nthe land-owners and occupiers, and on owners and occupiers of other real\r\nproperty, in those districts, we are equally well aware, that those owners\r\nand occupiers _have derived great benefits_ from that vast population that\r\nnow presses upon them. There is _land_ in the parish in which I am now\r\nwriting, and belonging to the farm in the house of which I am, which land\r\nwould not let for 20_s._ a statute acre; while land, not so good, would\r\nlet, in any part of Lancashire, near to the manufactories, at 60_s._ or\r\n80_s._ a statute acre. The same may be said with regard to _houses_. And,\r\npray, are the owners and occupiers, who have gained so largely by the\r\nmanufacturing works being near their lands and houses; are they, _now_, to\r\ncomplain, if the vicinage of these same works causes a charge of rates\r\n_there_, heavier than exists _here_? Are the owners and occupiers of\r\nLancashire to enjoy _an age of advantages_ from the labours of the\r\nspinners and the weavers; and are they, when a reverse comes, _to bear\r\nnone of the disadvantages_? Are they to make no sacrifices, in order to\r\nsave from perishing those industrious and ever-toiling creatures, by the\r\nlabours of whom their land and houses have been augmented in value, three,\r\nfive, or perhaps tenfold? None but the most unjust of mankind can answer\r\nthese questions in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n7. But as _greediness_ is never at a loss for excuses for the\r\nhard-heartedness that it is always ready to practise, it is said, that\r\n_the whole of the rents_ of the land and the houses would not suffice for\r\nthe purpose; that is to say, that if the poor rates were to be made so\r\nhigh as to leave the tenant no means of paying rent, even then some of the\r\npoor must go without a sufficiency of food. I have no doubt that, in\r\nparticular instances, this would be the case. But for cases like this the\r\nLAW has amply provided; for, in every case of this sort, _adjoining\r\nparishes_ may be made to _assist_ the hard pressed parish; and if the\r\npressure becomes severe on these adjoining parishes, those _next adjoining\r\nthem_ may be made to assist; and thus the call upon adjoining parishes\r\nmaybe extended till it reach _all over the county_. So good, so benignant,\r\nso wise, so foreseeing, and so effectual, is this, the very best of all\r\nour good old laws! This law or rather code of laws, distinguishes England\r\nfrom all the other countries in the world, _except the United States of\r\nAmerica_, where, while hundreds of other English statutes have been\r\nabolished, this law has always remained in full force, this great law of\r\nmercy and humanity, which says, that _no human being that treads English\r\nground shall perish for want of food and raiment_. For such poor persons\r\nas are _unable to work_, the law provides food and clothing; and it\r\ncommands that _work_ shall be provided for such as are able to work, and\r\n_cannot otherwise get employment_. This law was passed more than _two\r\nhundred years_ ago. Many attempts have been made to _chip it away_, and\r\nsome have been made to destroy it altogether; but it still exists, and\r\nevery man who does not wish to see general desolation take place, will do\r\nhis best to cause it to be duly and conscientiously executed.\r\n\r\n8. Having now, my friends of Preston, stated what the law is, and also the\r\nreasons for its honest enforcement in the particular case immediately\r\nbefore us, I will next endeavour to show you that it is founded in the law\r\nof nature, and that, were it not for the provisions of this law, people\r\nwould, according to the opinions of the greatest lawyers, have _a right_\r\nto _take_ food and raiment sufficient to preserve them from perishing; and\r\nthat _such taking_ would be neither _felony_ nor _larceny_. This is a\r\nmatter of the greatest importance; it is a most momentous question; for if\r\nit be settled in the affirmative--if it be settled that it is _not felony,\r\nnor larceny,_ to take other men's goods without their assent, and even\r\nagainst their will, when such taking is absolutely necessary to the\r\npreservation of life, how great, how imperative, is the duty of affording,\r\nif possible, _that relief which will prevent such necessity_! In other\r\nwords, how imperative it is on all overseers and justices to obey the law\r\nwith alacrity; and how weak are those persons who look to \"_grants_\" and\r\n\"_subscriptions_,\" to supply the place of the execution of this, the most\r\nimportant of all the laws that constitute the basis of English society!\r\nAnd if this question be settled in the affirmative; if we find the most\r\nlearned of lawyers and most wise of men, maintaining the affirmative of\r\nthis proposition; if we find them maintaining, that it is neither _felony_\r\nnor _larceny_ to take food, in case of _extreme necessity_, though without\r\nthe assent, and even against the will of the owner, what are we to think\r\nof those (and they are not few in number nor weak in power) who, animated\r\nwith the savage soul of the Scotch _feelosophers_, would wholly abolish\r\nthe poor-laws, or, at least, render them of little effect, and thereby\r\nconstantly keep thousands exposed to this dire necessity!\r\n\r\n9. In order to do justice to this great subject; in order to treat it with\r\nperfect fairness, and in a manner becoming of me and of you, I must take\r\nthe authorities _on both sides_. There are some great lawyers who have\r\ncontended that the starving man is still guilty of felony or larceny, if\r\nhe take food to satisfy his hunger; but there are a greater number of\r\nother, and still greater, lawyers, who maintain the contrary. The general\r\ndoctrine of those who maintain the right to take, is founded on the law of\r\nnature; and it is a saying as old as the hills, a saying in every language\r\nin the world, that \"_self-preservation_ is the _first law_ of nature.\" The\r\nlaw of nature teaches every creature to prefer the preservation of its own\r\nlife to all other things. But, in order to have a fair view of the matter\r\nbefore us, we ought to inquire how it came to pass, that the laws were\r\never made to punish men as criminals, for taking the victuals, drink, or\r\nclothing, that they might stand in need of. We must recollect, then, that\r\nthere was a time when no such laws existed; when men, like the wild\r\nanimals in the fields, took what they were able to take, if they wanted\r\nit. In this state of things, all the land and all the produce belonged to\r\nall the people _in common_. Thus were men situated, when they lived under\r\nwhat is called the _law of nature_; when every one provided, as he could,\r\nfor his self-preservation.\r\n\r\n10. At length this state of things became changed: men entered into\r\nsociety; they made laws to restrain individuals from following, in certain\r\ncases, the dictates of their own will; they protected the weak against the\r\nstrong; the laws secured men in possession of lands, houses, and goods,\r\nthat were called THEIRS; the words MINE and THINE, which mean _my own_ and\r\n_thy own_, were invented to designate what we now call _a property_ in\r\nthings. The law necessarily made it criminal in one man to take away, or\r\nto injure, the property of another man. It was, you will observe, even in\r\nthis state of nature, always _a crime_ to do certain things against our\r\nneighbour. To kill him, to wound him, to slander him, to expose him to\r\nsuffer from the want of food or raiment, or shelter. These, and many\r\nothers, were crimes in the eye of the law of nature; but, to take share of\r\na man's victuals or clothing; to go and insist upon sharing a part of any\r\nof the good things that he happened to have in his possession, could be\r\n_no crime_, because there was _no property_ in anything, except in man's\r\nbody itself. Now, civil society was formed for the _benefit_ of the whole.\r\nThe whole gave up their natural rights, in order that every one might, for\r\nthe future, enjoy his life in greater security. This civil society was\r\nintended to change the state of man _for the better_. Before this state of\r\ncivil society, the starving, the hungry, the naked man, had a right to go\r\nand provide himself with necessaries wherever he could find them. There\r\nwould be sure to be some such necessitous persons in a state of civil\r\nsociety. Therefore, when civil society was established, it is impossible\r\nto believe that it _had not in view some provision for these destitute\r\npersons_. It would be monstrous to suppose the contrary. The contrary\r\nsupposition would argue, that fraud was committed upon the mass of the\r\npeople in forming this civil society; for, as the sparks fly upwards, so\r\nwill there always be destitute persons to some extent or other, in _every\r\ncommunity_, and such there are to now a considerable extent, even in the\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA; therefore, the formation of the civil society\r\nmust have been fraudulent or tyrannical upon any other supposition than\r\nthat it made provision, in some way or other, for destitute persons; that\r\nis to say, for persons unable, from some cause or other, to provide for\r\nthemselves the food and raiment sufficient to preserve them from\r\nperishing. Indeed, a provision for the destitute seems _essential to the\r\nlawfulness_ of civil society; and this appears to have been the opinion of\r\nBLACKSTONE, when, in the first Book and first Chapter of his Commentaries\r\non the Laws of England, he says, \"the law not only regards _life_ and\r\n_member_, and protects every man in the enjoyment of them, but also\r\n_furnishes him with every thing necessary for their support_. For there is\r\nno man so indigent or wretched, but he may _demand_ a supply _sufficient\r\nfor all the necessaries of life_ from the more opulent part of the\r\ncommunity, by means of the several statutes enacted for the relief of the\r\npoor; a humane provision _dictated_ by the _principles of society_.\"\r\n\r\n11. No man will contend, that the main body of the people in any country\r\nupon earth, and of course in England, would have consented to abandon the\r\nrights of nature; to give up their right to enjoy all things in common; no\r\nman will believe, that the main body of the people would ever have given\r\ntheir assent to the establishing of a state of things which should make\r\nall the lands, and all the trees, and all the goods and cattle of every\r\nsort, private property; which should have shut out a large part of the\r\npeople from having such property, and which should, at the same time, not\r\nhave provided the means of preventing those of them, who might fall into\r\nindigence, from being _actually starved to death_! It is impossible to\r\nbelieve this. Men never gave their assent to enter into society on terms\r\nlike these. One part of the condition upon which men entered into society\r\nwas, that care should be taken that no human being should perish from\r\nwant. When they agreed to enter into that state of things, which would\r\nnecessarily cause some men to be rich and some men to be poor; when they\r\ngave up that right, which God had given them, to live as well as they\r\ncould, and to take the means wherever they found them, the condition\r\nclearly was, the \"_principle of society_;\" clearly was, as BLACKSTONE\r\ndefines it, that the indigent and wretched should have a right to\r\n\"_demand_ from the rich a supply _sufficient_ for all the _necessities_ of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n12. If the society did not take care to act upon this principle; if it\r\nneglected to secure the legal means, of preserving the life of the\r\nindigent and wretched; then the society itself, in so far as that\r\nwretched person was concerned, ceased to have a legal existence. It had,\r\nas far as related to him, forfeited its character of legality. It had no\r\nlonger any claim to his submission to its laws. His rights of nature\r\nreturned: as far as related to him, the law of Nature revived in all its\r\nforce: that state of things in which all men enjoyed all things _in\r\ncommon_ was revived with regard to him; and he took, and he had a right to\r\ntake, food and raiment, or, as Blackstone expresses it, \"a supply\r\nsufficient for all the necessities of life.\" For, if it be true, as laid\r\ndown by this English lawyer, that the _principles_ of society; if it be\r\ntrue, that the very principles, or _foundations_ of society dictate, that\r\nthe destitute person shall have a legal demand for a supply from the rich,\r\nsufficient for all the necessities of life; if this be true, and true it\r\ncertainly is, it follows of course that the principles, that is, the base,\r\nor _foundation_, of society, is subverted, is gone; and that society is,\r\nin fact, no longer what it was intended to be, when the indigent, when the\r\nperson in a state of extreme necessity, cannot, at once, obtain from the\r\nrich such sufficient supply: in short, we need go no further than this\r\npassage of BLACKSTONE, to show, that civil society is subverted, and that\r\nthere is, in fact, nothing legitimate in it, when the destitute and\r\nwretched have no certain and legal resource.\r\n\r\n13. But this is so important a matter, and there have been such monstrous\r\ndoctrines and projects put forth by MALTHUS, by the EDINBURGH REVIEWERS,\r\nby LAWYER SCARLETT, by LAWYER NOLAN, by STURGES BOURNE, and by an\r\ninnumerable swarm of persons who have been giving before the House of\r\nCommons what they call \"_evidence_:\" there have been such monstrous\r\ndoctrines and projects put forward by these and other persons; and there\r\nseems to be such a lurking desire to carry the hostility to the working\r\nclasses still further, that I think it necessary in order to show, that\r\nthese English poor-laws, which have been so much calumniated by so many\r\ngreedy proprietors of land; I think it necessary to show, that these\r\npoor-laws are the things which men of property, above all others, _ought\r\nto wish to see maintained_, seeing that, according to the opinions of the\r\ngreatest and the wisest of men, they must suffer most in consequence of\r\nthe abolition of those laws; because, by the abolition of those laws, the\r\nright given by the laws of nature would revive, and the destitute would\r\n_take_, where they now simply _demand_ (as BLACKSTONE expresses it) in the\r\nname of the law. There has been some difference of opinion, as to the\r\nquestion, whether it be _theft_ or _no theft_; or, rather, whether it be a\r\n_criminal act_, or _not a criminal act_, for a person, in a case of\r\nextreme necessity from want of food, to take food without the assent and\r\neven against the will, of the owner. We have, amongst our great lawyers,\r\nSIR MATTHEW HALE and SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, who contend (though as we\r\nshall see, with much feebleness, hesitation, and reservation,) that it _is\r\ntheft_, notwithstanding the extremity of the want; but there are many, and\r\nmuch higher authorities, foreign as well as English, on the other side.\r\nBefore, however, I proceed to the hearing of these authorities, let me\r\ntake a short view of _the origin of the poor laws in England_; for that\r\nview will convince us, that, though the present law was passed but a\r\nlittle more than two hundred years ago, there had been something to effect\r\nthe same purpose ever since England had been called England.\r\n\r\n14. According to the Common Law of England, as recorded in the MIRROUR OF\r\nJUSTICES, a book which was written before the Norman Conquest; a book in\r\nas high reputation, as a law-book, as any one in England; according to\r\nthis book, CHAPTER 1st, SECTION 3d, which treats of the \"First\r\nconstitutions made by the antient kings;\" According to this work,\r\nprovision was made for the sustenance of the poor. The words are these:\r\n\"It was ordained, that the poor should be sustained by _parsons_, by\r\n_rectors_ of the church, and by the _parishioners_, so that _none of them\r\ndie for want of sustenance_.\" Several hundred years later, the canons of\r\nthe church show, that when the church had become rich, it took upon itself\r\nthe whole of the care and expense attending the relieving of the poor.\r\nThese canons, in setting forth the manner in which the tithes should be\r\ndisposed of, say, \"Let the priests set apart the first share for the\r\nbuilding and ornaments of the church; let them distribute the _second to\r\nthe poor and strangers, with their own hands, in mercy and humility_; and\r\nlet them reserve the third part for themselves.\" This passage is taken\r\nfrom the canons of ELFRIC, canon 24th. At a later period, when the tithes\r\nhad, in some places, been appropriated to convents, acts of Parliament\r\nwere passed, compelling the impropriators to leave, in the hands of their\r\nvicar, a sufficiency for the maintenance of the poor. There were two or\r\nthree acts of this sort passed, one particularly in the twelfth year of\r\nRICHARD the Second, chapter 7th. So that here we have the most ancient\r\nbook on the Common Law; we have the canons of the church at a later\r\nperiod; we have acts of Parliament at a time when the power and glory of\r\nEngland were at their very highest point; we have all these to tell us,\r\nthat in England, from the very time that the country took the name, _there\r\nwas always a legal and secure provision for the poor, so that no person,\r\nhowever aged, infirm, unfortunate, or destitute, should suffer from want_.\r\n\r\n15. But, my friends, a time came when the provision made by the Common\r\nLaw, by the Canons of the Church, and by the Acts of the Parliament coming\r\nin aid of those canons; a time arrived, when all these were rendered null\r\nby what is called the PROTESTANT REFORMATION. This \"Reformation,\" As it is\r\ncalled, sweeped away the convents, gave a large part of the tithes to\r\ngreedy courtiers, put parsons with wives and children into the livings,\r\nand left the poor without any resource whatsoever. This terrible event,\r\nwhich deprived England of the last of her possessions on the continent of\r\nEurope, reduced the people of England to the most horrible misery; from\r\nthe happiest and best fed and best clad people in the world, it made them\r\nthe most miserable, the most wretched and ragged of creatures. At last it\r\nwas seen that, in spite of the most horrible tyranny that ever was\r\nexercised in the world, in spite of the racks and the gibbets and the\r\nmartial law of QUEEN ELIZABETH, those who had amassed to themselves the\r\nproperty out of which the poor had been formerly fed, were compelled to\r\n_pass a law to raise money, by way of tax, for relieving the necessities\r\nof the poor_. They had passed many acts before the FORTY-THIRD year of the\r\nreign of this Queen Elizabeth; but these acts were all found to be\r\nineffectual, till, at last, in the forty-third year of the reign: of this\r\ntyrannical Queen, and in the year of our Lord 1601, that famous act was\r\npassed, which has been in force until this day; and which, as I said\r\nbefore, is still in force, notwithstanding all the various attempts of\r\nfolly and cruelty to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n16. Thus, then, the present poor-laws are _no new thing_. They are no\r\n_gift_ to the working people. You hear the greedy landowners everlastingly\r\ncomplaining against this law of QUEEN ELIZABETH. They pretend that it was\r\n_an unfortunate_ law. They affect to regard it as a great INNOVATION,\r\nseeing that no such law existed before; but, as I have shown, a better law\r\nexisted before, having the same object in view. I have shown, that the\r\n\"Reformation,\" as it is called, had sweeped away that which had been\r\nsecured to the poor by the Common Law, by the Canons of the Church, and by\r\nancient Acts of Parliament. There was _nothing new_, then, in the way of\r\nbenevolence towards the people, in this celebrated Act of Parliament of\r\nthe reign of QUEEN ELIZABETH; and the landowners would act wisely by\r\nholding their tongues upon the subject; or, if they be too noisy, one may\r\nlook into their GRANTS, and see if we cannot find something THERE to keep\r\nout the present parochial assessments.\r\n\r\n17. Having now seen _the origin_ of the present poor-laws, and the justice\r\nof their due execution, let us return to those authorities of which I was\r\nspeaking but now, and an examination into which will show the extreme\r\ndanger of listening to those projectors who would abolish the poor-laws;\r\nthat is to say, who would sweep away that provision which was established\r\nin the reign of QUEEN ELIZABETH, from a conviction that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to preserve the peace of the country and the lives of the\r\npeople. I observed before that there has been some difference of opinion\r\namongst lawyers as to the question, whether it be, or be not, _theft_, to\r\ntake without his consent and against his will, the victuals of another, in\r\norder to prevent the taker from starving. SIR MATTHEW HALE and SIR WILLIAM\r\nBLACKSTONE say that it _is theft_. I am now going to quote the several\r\nauthorities on both sides, and it will be necessary for me to indicate the\r\nworks which I quote from by the words, letters, and figures which are\r\nusually made use of in quoting from these works. Some part of what I shall\r\nquote will be in Latin: but I shall put nothing in that language of which\r\nI will not give you the translation. I beg you to read these quotations\r\nwith the greatest attention; for you will find, at the end of your\r\nreading, that you have obtained great knowledge upon the subject, and\r\nknowledge, too, which will not soon depart from your minds.\r\n\r\n18. I begin with SIR MATTHEW HALE, (a Chief Justice of the Court of King's\r\nBench in the reign of Charles the Second,) who, in his PLEAS OF THE CROWN,\r\nCHAP. IX., has the following passage, which I put in distinct paragraphs,\r\nand mark A, B, and C.\r\n\r\n19. A. \"Some of the casuists, and particularly COVARRUVIUS, Tom. I. _De\r\nfurti et rapinae restitutione_, Sec. 3, 4, p. 473; and GROTIUS, _de jure\r\nbelli, ac pacis_; lib. II. cap. 2. Sec. 6, tell us, that in case of extreme\r\nnecessity, either of hunger or clothing, the _civil distributions of\r\nproperty cease_, and by a kind of tacit condition the _first community\r\ndoth return_, and upon this those common assertions are grounded:\r\n'_Quicquid necessitas cogit, defendit._' [Whatever necessity calls for, it\r\njustifies.] '_Necessitas est lex temporis et loci._' [Necessity is the law\r\nof time and place.] '_In casu extremae necessitatis omnia sunt communia._'\r\n[In case of extreme necessity, all things are _in common_;] and,\r\ntherefore, in such case _theft is no theft_, or at least not punishable as\r\ntheft; and some even of our own lawyers have asserted the same; and very\r\nbad use hath been made of this concession by some of the _Jesuitical_\r\ncasuists of _France_, who have thereupon advised apprentices and servants\r\nto rob their masters, where they have been indeed themselves in want of\r\nnecessaries, of clothes or victuals; whereof, they tell them, they\r\nthemselves are the competent judges; and by this means let loose, as much\r\nas they can, by their doctrine of probability, all the ligaments of\r\nproperty and civil society.\"\r\n\r\n20. B. \"I do, therefore, _take it_, that, where persons live under the\r\nsame civil government, _as here in England_, that rule, at least by the\r\nlaws of _England_, is false; and, therefore, if a person being _under\r\nnecessity for want of victuals_, or clothes, shall, upon that account,\r\nclandestinely, and '_animo furandi_,' [with intent to steal,] steal\r\nanother man's goods, it is felony, and a crime, by the laws of _England_,\r\npunishable with death; although, the judge before whom the trial is, in\r\nthis case (as in other cases of extremity) be by the laws of _England_\r\nintrusted with a power to reprieve the offender, before or after judgment,\r\nin order to the obtaining the King's mercy. For, 1st, Men's properties\r\nwould be under a strange insecurity, being laid open to other men's\r\nnecessities, whereof no man can possibly judge, but the party himself.\r\nAnd, 2nd, Because by the laws of this kingdom [here he refers to the 43\r\nEliz. cap. 2] sufficient provision is made for the supply of such\r\nnecessities by collections for the poor, and by the power of the civil\r\nmagistrate. Consonant hereunto seems to be the law even among the Jews; if\r\nwe may believe the wisest of kings. Proverbs vi. 30, 31. '_Men do not\r\ndespise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry, but if\r\nhe be found, he shall restore seven-fold, he shall give all the substance\r\nof his house._' It is true, _death_ among them was not the penalty of\r\ntheft, yet his necessity gave him _no exception_ from the ordinary\r\npunishment inflicted by their law upon that offence.\"\r\n\r\n21. C. \"Indeed this rule, '_in casu extremae necessitatis omnia sunt\r\ncommunia_,' does hold, in some measure, in some particular cases, where,\r\nby the tacit consent of nations, or of some particular countries or\r\nsocieties, it hath obtained. First, among the _Jews_, it was lawful in\r\ncase of hunger to pull ears of standing corn, and eat, (Matt. xii. 1;) and\r\nfor one to pass through a vineyard, or olive-yard, to gather and eat\r\nwithout carrying away. Deut. xxiii. 24, 25. SECOND, By the _Rhodian_ law,\r\nand the common-maritime custom, if the common provision for the ship's\r\ncompany fail, the master may, under certain temperaments, _break open the\r\nprivate chests of the mariners or passengers_, and _make a distribution_\r\nof that particular and private provision for the _preservation of the\r\nship's company_.\" Vide CONSOLATO DEL MARE, cap. 256. LE CUSTOMES DE LA\r\nMERE, p. 77.\r\n\r\n22. SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE agrees, in substance, with HALE; but he is, as\r\nwe shall presently see, much more eager to establish his doctrine; and, we\r\nshall see besides, that he has not scrupled to be guilty of misquoting,\r\nand of very shamefully _garbling_, _the Scripture_, in order to establish\r\nhis point. We shall find him flatly contradicting the laws of England;\r\nbut, he might have spared the Holy Scriptures, which, however, he has not\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n23. To return to HALE, you see he is compelled to begin with acknowledging\r\nthat there are great authorities against him; and he could not say that\r\nGROTIUS was not one of the most virtuous as well as one of the most\r\nlearned of mankind. HALE does not know very well what to do with those old\r\nsayings about the justification which hard necessity gives: he does not\r\nknow what to do with the maxim, that, \"in case of extreme necessity all\r\nthings _are owned in common_.\" He is exceedingly puzzled with these\r\nancient authorities, and flies off into prattle rather than argument, and\r\ntells us a story about \"_jesuitical_\" casuists in France, who advised\r\napprentices and servants to rob their masters, and that they thus \"let\r\nloose the ligaments of property and civil society.\" I fancy that it would\r\nrequire a pretty large portion of that sort of faith which induced this\r\nProtestant judge to send witches and wizards to the gallows; a pretty\r\nlarge portion of this sort of faith, to make us believe, that the\r\n\"_casuists_ of France,\" who, doubtless, _had servants of their own_, would\r\nteach servants to rob their masters! In short, this prattle of the judge\r\nseems to have been nothing more than one of those Protestant effusions\r\nwhich were too much in fashion at the time when he wrote.\r\n\r\n24. He begins his second paragraph, or paragraph B., by saying, that he\r\n\"_takes it_\" to be so and so; and then comes another qualified expression;\r\nhe talks of civil government \"_as here in England_.\" Then he says, that\r\nthe rule of GROTIUS and others, against which he has been contending, \"he\r\ntakes _to be false_, at _least_,\" says he, \"_by the laws of England_.\"\r\nAfter he has made all these qualifications, he then proceeds to say that\r\n_such taking is theft_; that it is _felony_; and it is a crime which the\r\nlaws of England punish with _death_! But, as if stricken with remorse at\r\nputting the frightful words upon paper; as if feeling shame for the law\r\nand for England itself, he instantly begins to tell us, that the judge who\r\npresides at the trial is intrusted, \"_by the laws of England_,\" with power\r\nto _reprieve_ the offender, in order to the obtaining of the _King's\r\nmercy_! Thus he softens it down. He will have it to be LAW to put a man to\r\ndeath in such a case; but he is ashamed to leave his readers to believe,\r\nthat an English judge and an English king WOULD OBEY THIS LAW!\r\n\r\n25. Let us now hear the reasons which he gives for this which he pretends\r\nto be law. His first reason is, that there would be no security for\r\nproperty, if it were laid open to the necessities of the indigent, of\r\nwhich necessities _no man but the takers themselves could be the judge_.\r\nHe talks of a \"strange insecurity;\" but, upon my word, no insecurity could\r\nbe half so strange as this assertion of his own. BLACKSTONE has just the\r\nsame argument. \"Nobody,\" says he, \"would be a judge of the wants of the\r\ntaker, but the taker himself;\" and BLACKSTONE, copying the very words of\r\nHALE, talks of the \"strange insecurity\" arising from this cause. Now,\r\nthen, suppose a man to come into my house, and to take away a bit of\r\nbacon. Suppose me to pursue him and seize him. He would tell me that he\r\nwas starving for want of food. I hope that the bare statement would induce\r\nme, or any man in the world that I do call or ever have called my friend,\r\nto let him go without further inquiry; but, if I chose to push the matter\r\nfurther, there would be _the magistrate_. If he chose to commit the man,\r\nwould there not be a _jury_ and a _judge_ to receive evidence and to\r\nascertain _whether the extreme necessity existed or not_?\r\n\r\n26. Aye, says Judge HALE; but I have another reason, a devilish deal\r\nbetter than this, \"and that is, the act of the 43d year of the reign of\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH!\" Aye, my old boy, that is a thumping reason! \"_Sufficient\r\nprovision_ is made for the supply of such necessities by _collections for\r\nthe poor_, and by the _power of the civil magistrate_.\" Aye, aye! that is\r\nthe reason; and, Mr. SIR MATTHEW HALE, there is _no other reason_, say\r\nwhat you will about the matter. There stand the overseer and the civil\r\nmagistrate to take care that such necessities be provided for; and if they\r\ndid not stand there for that purpose, the law of nature would be revived\r\nin behalf of the suffering creature.\r\n\r\n27. HALE, not content however with this act of QUEEN ELIZABETH, and still\r\nhankering after this hard doctrine, furbishes up a bit of Scripture, and\r\ncalls Solomon the _wisest of kings_ on account of these two verses which\r\nhe has taken. HALE observes, indeed, that the Jews did not put thieves to\r\n_death_; but, to restore seven-fold was the _ordinary punishment_,\r\ninflicted by their law, for theft; and here, says he, we see, that the\r\nextreme necessity _gave no exemption_. This was a piece of such flagrant\r\nsophistry on the part of HALE, that he could not find in his heart to send\r\nit forth to the world without a qualifying observation; but even this\r\nqualifying observation left the sophistry still so shameful, that his\r\neditor, Mr. EMLYN, who published the work under authority of the House of\r\nCommons, did not think it consistent with his reputation to suffer this\r\npassage to go forth unaccompanied with the following remark: \"But their\r\n(the Jews') ordinary punishment being entirely _pecuniary_, could affect\r\nhim _only when he was found in a condition to answer it_; and therefore\r\nthe same reasons which could justify that, can, by no means, be extended\r\nto a _corporal_, much less to a _capital_ punishment.\" Certainly: and this\r\nis the fair interpretation of these two verses of the Proverbs.\r\nPUFFENDORF, one of the greatest authorities that the world knows anything\r\nof, observes, upon the argument built upon this text of Scripture, \"It may\r\nbe objected, that, in Proverbs, chap. vi. verses 30, 31, he is called a\r\n_thief_, and pronounced obnoxious to the penalty of theft, who steals to\r\nsatisfy his hunger; but whoever closely views and considers that text will\r\nfind that the thief there censured is neither in such _extreme necessity_\r\nas we are now supposing, nor seems to have fallen into his needy condition\r\nmerely by ill fortune, without his own idleness or default: for the\r\ncontext implies, that he had _a house and goods sufficient_ to make\r\nseven-fold restitution; which he might have either sold or pawned; a\r\nchapman or creditor being easily to be met with in times of plenty and\r\npeace; for we have no grounds to think that the fact there mentioned is\r\nsupposed to be committed, either in time of war, or upon account of the\r\nextraordinary price of provisions.\"\r\n\r\n28. Besides this, I think it is clear that these two verses of the\r\nProverbs do not apply to _one and the same person_; for in the first verse\r\nit is said, that men _do not despise_ a thief if he steal to satisfy his\r\nsoul when he is hungry. How, then, are we to reconcile this with\r\n_morality_? Are we not to despise a _thief_? It is clear that the word\r\n_thief_ does not apply to the first case; but to the second case only; and\r\nthat the distinction was here made for the express purpose of preventing\r\nthe man who took food to relieve his hunger _from being confounded with\r\nthe thief_. Upon any other interpretation, it makes the passage contain\r\nnonsense and immorality; and, indeed, GROTIUS says that the latter text\r\ndoes not apply to the person mentioned in the former. The latter text\r\ncould not mean a man taking food from necessity. It is _impossible_ that\r\nit can mean that; because the man who was starving for want of food _could\r\nnot have_ seven-fold; _could not have_ any substance in his house. But\r\nwhat are we to think of JUDGE BLACKSTONE, who, in his Book IV., chap. 2,\r\nreally _garbles_ these texts of Scripture. He clearly saw the effect of\r\nthe expression, \"MEN DO NOT DESPISE;\" he saw what an awkward figure these\r\nwords made, coming before the words \"A THIEF;\" he saw that, with these\r\nwords in the text, he could never succeed in making his readers believe\r\nthat a man ought to be _hanged_ for taking food to save his life. He\r\nclearly saw that he could not make men believe that _God had said this_,\r\nunless he could, somehow or other, get rid of those words about NOT\r\nDESPISING the thief that took victuals when he was hungry. Being,\r\ntherefore, very much pestered and annoyed by these words about NOT\r\nDESPISING, what does he do but fairly _leave them out_! And not only leave\r\nthem out, but leave out a part of both the verses, keeping in that part of\r\neach that suited him, and no more; nay, further, leaving out one word, and\r\nputting in another, giving a sense to the whole which he knew well never\r\nwas intended. He states the passage to be this: \"If a thief steal to\r\nsatisfy his soul when he is hungry, _he_ shall restore seven-fold, _and_\r\nshall give all the substance of his house.\" No broomstick that ever was\r\nhandled would have been too heavy or too rough for the shoulders of this\r\ndirty-souled man. HALE, with all his desire to make out a case in favour\r\nof severity, has given us the words fairly: but this shuffling fellow;\r\nthis smooth-spoken and mean wretch, who is himself _thief_ enough, God\r\nknows, if stealing other men's thoughts and words constitute theft; this\r\nintolerably mean reptile has, in the first place, left out the words\r\n\"_men do not despise_:\" then he has left out the words at the beginning of\r\nthe next text, \"_but if he be found_.\" Then in place of the \"_he_,\" which\r\ncomes before the words \"_shall give_\" he puts the word \"_and_;\" and thus\r\nhe makes the whole apply to the poor creature that takes to satisfy his\r\nsoul when he is hungry! He leaves out every mitigating word of the\r\nScripture; and, in his reference, he represents the passage to be in _one_\r\nverse! Perhaps, even in the history of the conduct of crown-lawyers, there\r\nis not to be found mention of an act so coolly bloody-minded as this. It\r\nhas often been said of this BLACKSTONE, that he not only _lied_ himself,\r\nbut _made others lie_; he has here made, as far as he was able, a liar of\r\nKing Solomon himself: he has wilfully garbled the Holy Scripture; and\r\nthat, too, for the manifest purpose of justifying cruelty in courts and\r\njudges; for the manifest purpose of justifying the most savage oppression\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\n29. After all, HALE has not the courage to send forth this doctrine of\r\nhis, without allowing that the case of extreme necessity does, \"in _some\r\nmeasure_,\" and \"in _particular cases_,\" and, \"by the _tacit_ or _silent_\r\nconsent of nations,\" _hold good_! What a crowd of qualifications is here!\r\nWith what reluctance he confesses that which all the world knows to be\r\ntrue, that the disciples of JESUS CHRIST pulled off, without leave, the\r\nears of standing corn, and ate them \"_being an hungered_.\" And here are\r\ntwo things to observe upon. In the first place this _corn_ was not what\r\n_we call corn_ here in England, or else it would have been very droll sort\r\nof stuff to crop off and eat. It was what the Americans call _Indian\r\ncorn_, what the French call _Turkish corn_; and what is called _corn_ (as\r\nbeing far surpassing all other in excellence) in the Eastern countries\r\nwhere the Scriptures were written. About four or five ears of this corn,\r\nof which you strip all the husk off in a minute, are enough for a man's\r\nbreakfast or dinner; and by about the middle of August this corn is just\r\nas wholesome and as efficient as bread. So that, this was _something_ to\r\ntake and eat without the owner's leave; it was something of value; and\r\nobserve, that the Pharisees, though so strongly disposed to find fault\r\nwith everything that was done by Jesus Christ and his disciples, did not\r\nfind fault of their _taking_ the corn to eat; did not call them _thieves_;\r\ndid not propose to punish them for _theft_; but found fault of them only\r\nfor having _plucked the corn on the Sabbath-day_! To pluck the corn was\r\n_to do work_, and these severe critics found fault of this working on the\r\nSabbath-day. Then, out comes another fact, which HALE might have noticed\r\nif he had chosen it; namely, that our Saviour reminds the Pharisees that\r\n\"DAVID and his companions, _being an hungered_, entered into the House of\r\nGod, and did eat the show-bread, to eat which was unlawful in any-body but\r\nthe priests.\" Thus, that which would have been _sacrilege_ under any other\r\ncircumstances; that which would have been one of the most _horrible of\r\ncrimes against the law of God_, became no crime at all when committed by a\r\nperson _pressed by hunger_.\r\n\r\n30. Nor has JUDGE HALE fairly interpreted the two verses of DEUTERONOMY.\r\nHe represents the matter thus: that, if you be _passing through_ a\r\nvineyard or an olive-yard you may gather and eat, without being deemed a\r\nthief. This interpretation would make an Englishman believe that the\r\nScripture allowed of this taking and eating, only where there was a\r\n_lawful foot-way_ through the vineyard. This is a very gross\r\nmisrepresentation of the matter; for if you look at the two texts, you\r\nwill find, that they say that, \"when thou _comest into_;\" that is to say,\r\nwhen thou _enterest_ or _goest into_, \"thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou\r\nmayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure, but thou shalt not put\r\nany in thy vessel;\" that is to say, that you should not go and make wine\r\nin his vineyard and carry it away. Then in case of the corn, precisely the\r\nsame law is laid down. You may pluck with your _hand_; but not use the\r\n_hook_ or a _sickle_. Nothing can be plainer than this: no distinction can\r\nbe wiser, nor more just. HALE saw the force of it; and therefore, as\r\nthese texts made very strongly against him, he does not give them at full\r\nlength, but gives us a misrepresenting abbreviation.\r\n\r\n31. He had, however, too much regard for his reputation to conclude\r\nwithout acknowledging the right of seizing on the provisions of others _at\r\nsea_. He allows that private chests may be _broken open_ to prevent men\r\nfrom dying with hunger at sea. He does not stop to tell us why men's lives\r\nare _more precious_ on sea than on land. He does not attempt to reconcile\r\nthese liberties given by the Scripture, and by the maritime laws, with his\r\nown hard doctrine. In short, he brings us to this at last: that he will\r\n_not acknowledge_, that it is _not theft_ to take another man's goods,\r\nwithout his consent, under any circumstances; but, while he will not\r\nacknowledge this, he plainly leaves us to conclude, that no English judge\r\nand no English king will _ever punish_ a poor creature that takes victuals\r\nto save himself from perishing; and he plainly leaves us to conclude, that\r\nit is the _poor-laws_ of England; that it is their existence and _their\r\ndue execution_, which deprive everybody in England of the right to take\r\nfood and raiment in case of extreme necessity.\r\n\r\n32. Here I agree with him most cordially; and it is because I agree with\r\nhim in this, that I deprecate the abominable projects of those who would\r\nannihilate the poor-laws, seeing that it is those very poor-laws which\r\ngive, under all circumstances, really legal security _to property_.\r\nWithout them, cases must frequently arise, which would, according to the\r\nlaw of nature, according to the law of God, and as we shall see before we\r\nhave done, according to the law of England, bring us into a state, or, at\r\nleast, bring particular persons into a state, which as far as related to\r\nthem, would cause the law of nature to _revive_, and to make _all things\r\nto be owned in common_. To adhere, then, to these poor-laws; to cause them\r\nto be duly executed, to prevent every encroachment upon them, to preserve\r\nthem as the apple of our eye, are the duty of every Englishman, as far as\r\nhe has capacity so to do.\r\n\r\n33. I have, my friends, cited, as yet, authorities only _on one side_ of\r\nthis great subject, which it was my wish to discuss in this one Number. I\r\nfind that to be impossible without leaving undone much more than half my\r\nwork. I am extremely anxious to cause this matter to be well understood,\r\nnot only by the working classes, but by the owners of the land and the\r\nmagistrates. I deem it to be of the greatest possible importance; and,\r\nwhile writing on it, I address myself to you, because I most sincerely\r\ndeclare that I have a greater respect for you than for any other body of\r\npersons that I know any thing of. The next Number will conclude the\r\ndiscussion of the subject. The whole will lie in a very small compass.\r\n_Sixpence_ only will be the cost of it. It will creep about, by degrees,\r\nover the whole of this kingdom. All the authorities, all the arguments,\r\nwill be brought into this small compass; and I do flatter myself that many\r\nmonths will not pass over our heads, before all but misers and madmen will\r\nbe ashamed to talk of abolishing the poor-rates and of supporting the\r\nneedy by grants and subscriptions.\r\n\r\n  I am,\r\n  Your faithful friend and\r\n  Most obedient servant,\r\n  WM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bollitree Castle, Herefordshire, 22d Sept. 1826._\r\n\r\nMY EXCELLENT FRIENDS,\r\n\r\n34. In the last Number, paragraph 33, I told you, that I would, in the\r\npresent Number, conclude the discussion of the great question of _theft,\r\nor no theft_, in a case of taking another's goods without his consent, or\r\nagainst his will, the taker being pressed by extreme necessity. I laid\r\nbefore you; in the last Number, JUDGE HALE'S doctrine upon the subject;\r\nand I there mentioned the foul conduct of BLACKSTONE, the author of the\r\n\"Commentaries on the Laws of England.\" I will not treat this unprincipled\r\nlawyer, this shocking court sycophant; I will not treat him as he has\r\ntreated King Solomon and the Holy Scriptures; I will not garble, misquote,\r\nand belie him, as he garbled, misquoted, and belied them; I will give the\r\nwhole of the passage to which I allude, and which my readers may find in\r\nthe Fourth Book of his Commentaries. I request you to read it with great\r\nattention; and to compare it, very carefully, with the passage that I have\r\nquoted from SIR MATTHEW HALE, which you will find in paragraphs from 19 to\r\n21 inclusive. The passage from BLACKSTONE is as follows:\r\n\r\n35. \"There is yet another case of necessity, which has occasioned great\r\nspeculation among the writers upon general law; viz., whether a man in\r\nextreme want of food or clothing may justify stealing either, to relieve\r\nhis present necessities. And this both GROTIUS and PUFFENDORF, together\r\nwith _many other_ of the foreign jurists, hold in the affirmative;\r\nmaintaining by many ingenious, humane, and plausible reasons, that in such\r\ncases the community of goods by a kind of tacit concession of society is\r\nrevived. And some even of our own lawyers have held the same; though it\r\nseems to be an unwarranted doctrine, borrowed from the notions of some\r\ncivilians: at least it is now antiquated, the law of England admitting no\r\nsuch excuse at present. And this its doctrine is agreeable not only to the\r\nsentiments of many of the wisest ancients, particularly CICERO, who holds\r\nthat 'suum cuique incommodum ferendum est, potius quam de alterius\r\ncommodis detrahendum;' but also to the Jewish law, as certified by King\r\nSolomon himself: 'If a thief steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry,\r\nhe shall restore seven-fold, and shall give all the substance of his\r\nhouse:' which was the ordinary punishment for theft in that kingdom. And\r\nthis is founded upon the highest reason: for men's properties would be\r\nunder a strange insecurity, if liable to be invaded according to the\r\nwants of others; of which wants no man can possibly be an adequate judge,\r\nbut the party himself who pleads them. In this country especially, there\r\nwould be a peculiar impropriety in admitting so dubious an excuse; for by\r\nour laws such a sufficient provision is made for the poor by the power of\r\nthe civil magistrate, that it is impossible that the most needy stranger\r\nshould ever be reduced to the necessity of thieving to support nature.\r\nThis case of a stranger is, by the way, the strongest instance put by\r\nBaron PUFFENDORF, and whereon he builds his principal arguments; which,\r\nhowever they may hold upon the continent, where the parsimonious industry\r\nof the natives orders every one to work or starve, yet must lose all their\r\nweight and efficacy in England, where _charity is reduced to a system, and\r\ninterwoven in our very constitution_. Therefore, our laws ought by no\r\nmeans to be taxed with being _unmerciful_, for denying this privilege to\r\nthe necessitous; especially when we consider, that the king, on the\r\nrepresentation of his ministers of justice, hath a power to soften the\r\nlaw, and to extend mercy in cases of peculiar hardship. An advantage which\r\nis wanting in many states, particularly those which are democratical: and\r\nthese have in its stead introduced and adopted, in the body of the law\r\nitself, a multitude of circumstances tending to alleviate its rigour. But\r\nthe founders of our constitution thought it better to vest in the crown\r\nthe power of pardoning peculiar objects of compassion, than to countenance\r\nand establish theft by one general undistinguishing law.\"\r\n\r\n36. First of all, I beg you to observe, that this passage is merely _a\r\nflagrant act of theft_, committed upon JUDGE HALE; next, you perceive,\r\nthat which I noticed in paragraph 28, a most base and impudent garbling of\r\nthe Scriptures. Next, you see, that BLACKSTONE, like HALE, comes, at last,\r\nto the _poor-laws_; and tells us that to take other men's goods without\r\nleave, is theft, _because_ \"charity is here reduced to a system, and\r\ninterwoven in our very constitution.\" That is to say, to relieve the\r\nnecessitous; to prevent their suffering from want; completely to render\r\nstarvation impossible, makes a part of our very constitution. \"THEREFORE,\r\nour laws ought by no means to be taxed with being _unmerciful_ for denying\r\nthis privilege to the necessitous.\" Pray mark the word _therefore_. You\r\nsee, our laws, he says, are not to be taxed with being unmerciful in\r\ndeeming the necessitous taker _a thief_. And _why_ are they not to be\r\ndeemed unmerciful? BECAUSE the laws provide effectual relief for the\r\nnecessitous. It follows, then, of course, even according to BLACKSTONE\r\nhimself, that if the Constitution _had not_ provided this effectual relief\r\nfor the necessitous, then the laws _would have been unmerciful_ in deeming\r\nthe necessitous taker a thief.\r\n\r\n37. But now let us hear what that GROTIUS and that PUFFENDORF say; let us\r\nhear what these great writers on the law of nature and of nations say upon\r\nthis subject. BLACKSTONE has mentioned the names of them both; but he has\r\nnot thought proper to notice their arguments, much less has he attempted\r\nto answer them. They are two of the most celebrated men that ever wrote;\r\nand their writings are referred to as high authority, with regard to all\r\nthe subjects of which they have treated. The following is a passage from\r\nGROTIUS, on War and Peace, Book II., chap. 2.\r\n\r\n38. \"Let us see, further, what common right there appertains to men in\r\nthose things which have already become the property of individuals. Some\r\npersons, perchance, may consider it strange to question this, as\r\nproprietorship seems to have absorbed all that right which arose out of a\r\nstate of things in common. But it is not so. For, it is to be considered,\r\n_what was the intention of those who first introduced private property_,\r\nwhich we may suppose to have been such, as to deviate as little as\r\npossible from _natural equity_. For if even _written laws_ are to be\r\nconstrued in that sense, as far as it is practicable, much more so are\r\n_customs_, which are not fettered by the chains of writers.--Hence it\r\nfollows, first, that, in case of _extreme necessity_, the _pristine right\r\nof using things revives_, as much as if they had remained in common;\r\nbecause, in all human laws, as well as in the law of private property,\r\n_this case of extreme necessity appears to have been excepted_.--So, if\r\nthe means of sustenance, as in case of a sea-voyage, should chance to\r\nfail, that which any individual may have, should be shared in common. And\r\nthus, a fire having broken out, I am justified in destroying the house of\r\nmy neighbour, in order to preserve my own house; and I may cut in two the\r\nropes or cords amongst which any ship is driven, if it cannot be otherwise\r\ndisentangled. All which exceptions are not made in the written law, but\r\nare presumed.--For the opinion has been acknowledged amongst Divines,\r\nthat, if any one, in such case of necessity, take from another person what\r\nis requisite for the preservation of his life, _he does not commit a\r\ntheft_. The meaning of which definition is not, as many contend, that the\r\nproprietor of the thing be bound to give to the needy upon the principle\r\nof _charity_; but, that all things distinctly vested in proprietors ought\r\nto be regarded as such _with a certain benign acknowledgment of the\r\nprimitive right_. For if the original distributors of things were\r\nquestioned, as to what they thought about this matter, they would reply\r\nwhat I have said. _Necessity_, says Father SENECA, _the great excuse for\r\nhuman weakness, breaks every law_; that is to say, _human law_, or law\r\nmade after the manner of man.\"\r\n\r\n39. \"But cautions ought to be had, for fear this license should be abused:\r\nof which the principal is, to try, in every way, whether the necessity can\r\nbe avoided by any other means; for instance, by making application to the\r\nmagistrate, or even by trying whether the use of the thing can, by\r\nentreaties, be obtained from the proprietor. PLATO permits water to be\r\nfetched from the well of a neighbour upon this condition alone, that the\r\nperson asking for such permission shall dig in his own well in search of\r\nwater as far as the chalk: and SOLON, that he shall dig in his own well\r\nas far as forty cubits. Upon which PLUTARCH adds, _that he judged that\r\nnecessity was to be relieved, not laziness to be encouraged_.\"\r\n\r\n40. Such is the doctrine of this celebrated civilian. Let us now hear\r\nPUFFENDORF; and you will please to bear in mind, that both these writers\r\nare of the greatest authority upon all subjects connected with the laws of\r\nnature and of nations. We read in their works the result of an age of\r\nstudy: they have been two of the great guides of mankind ever since they\r\nwrote: and, we are not to throw them aside, in order to listen exclusively\r\nto Parson HAY, to HULTON OF HULTON, or to NICHOLAS GRIMSHAW. They tell us\r\nwhat they, and what other wise men, deemed to be right; and, as we shall\r\nby and by see, the laws of England, so justly boasted of by our ancestors,\r\nhold precisely the same language with these celebrated men. After the\r\nfollowing passage from PUFFENDORF, I shall show you what our own lawyers\r\nsay upon the subject; but I request you to read the following passage with\r\nthe greatest attention.\r\n\r\n41. \"Let us inquire, in the next place, whether the necessity of\r\npreserving our life can give us any right over other men's goods, so as to\r\nmake it allowable for us to seize on them for our relief, either secretly,\r\nor by open force, against the owner's consent. For the more clear and\r\nsolid determination of which point, we think it necessary to hint in short\r\non the causes upon which distinct _properties_ were first introduced in\r\nthe world; designing to examine them more at large in their proper place.\r\nNow the main reasons on which _properties_ are founded, we take to be\r\nthese two; that the feuds and quarrels might be appeased which arose in\r\nthe _primitive communion_ of things, and that men might be put under a\r\nkind of necessity of being industrious, every one being to get his\r\nmaintenance by his own application and labour. This division, therefore,\r\nof goods, was not made, that every person should sit idly brooding over\r\nthe share of wealth he had got, without assisting or serving his fellows;\r\nbut that any one might dispose of his things how he pleased; and if he\r\nthought fit to communicate them to others, he might, at least, be thus\r\nfurnished with an opportunity of laying obligations on the rest of\r\nmankind. Hence, when properties were once established, men obtained a\r\npower, not only of exercising commerce to their mutual advantage and gain,\r\nbut likewise of dispensing more largely in the works of humanity and\r\nbeneficence; whence their diligence had procured them a greater share of\r\ngoods than others: whereas before, when all things lay in common, men\r\ncould lend one another no assistance but what was supplied by their\r\ncorporeal ability, and could be charitable of nothing but of their\r\n_strength_. Further, such is the force of _property_, that the\r\n_proprietor_ hath a right of delivering his goods with his own hands; even\r\nsuch as he is obliged to give to others. Whence it follows, that when one\r\nman has anything owing from another, he is not presently to seize on it at\r\na venture, but ought to apply himself to the owner, desiring to receive it\r\nfrom his disposal. Yet in case the other party refuse thus to make good\r\nhis obligation, the power and privilege of _property_ doth not reach so\r\nfar as that the things may not be taken away without the owner's consent,\r\neither by the authority of the magistrate in _civil communities_, or in a\r\n_state of nature_, by violence and hostile force. And though in regard to\r\nbare Natural Right, for a man to relieve another in extremity with his\r\ngoods, for which he himself hath not so much occasion, be a duty obliging\r\nonly _imperfectly_, and not in the manner of a _debt_, since it arises\r\nwholly from the virtue of _humanity_; yet there seems to be no reason why,\r\nby the additional force of a civil ordinance, it may not be turned into a\r\nstrict and perfect obligation. And this _Seldon_ observes to have been\r\ndone among the _Jews_; who, upon a man's refusing to give such alms as\r\nwere proper for him, _could force him to it by an action at law_. It is no\r\nwonder, therefore, that they should forbid _their poor_, on any account,\r\nto seize on the goods of others, enjoining them to take only what private\r\npersons, or the public officers, or stewards of alms, should give them on\r\ntheir petition. Whence the stealing of what was another's, though upon\r\nextreme necessity, passed in that state for theft or rapine. But now\r\nsupposing _under another government the like good provision is not made\r\nfor persons in want_, supposing likewise that the covetous temper of men\r\nof substance cannot be prevailed on to give relief, and that the needy\r\ncreature is not able, either by his work or service, or by making sale of\r\nanything that he possesses, to assist his present necessity, _must_ he,\r\n_therefore, perish with famine_? Or _can any human institution bind me_\r\nwith such a force that, in case another man neglects his duty towards me,\r\n_I must rather die, than recede a little from the ordinary and regular way\r\nof acting_? We conceive, therefore, that such a person doth _not contract\r\nthe guilt of theft_, who happening, not through his own fault, to be in\r\nextreme want, either of necessary food, or of clothes to preserve him from\r\nthe violence of the weather, and cannot obtain them from the voluntary\r\ngift of the rich, either by urgent entreaties, or by offering somewhat\r\nequivalent in price, or by engaging _to work it out, shall either forcibly\r\nor privily relieve himself out of their abundance_; especially if he do it\r\nwith full intention to pay the value of them whenever his better fortune\r\ngives him ability. Some men deny that such a case of _necessity_, as we\r\nspeak of, can possibly happen. But what if a man should wander in a\r\nforeign land, unknown, friendless, and in want, spoiled of all he had by\r\nshipwreck, or by robbers, or having lost by some casualty whatever he was\r\nworth in his own country; should none be found willing either to relieve\r\nhis distress, or to hire his service, or should they rather (as it\r\ncommonly happens,) seeing him in a good garb, suspect him to beg without\r\nreason, must the poor creature starve in this miserable condition?\"\r\n\r\n42. Many other great foreign authorities might be referred to, and I\r\ncannot help mentioning COVARRUVIUS, who is spoken of by JUDGE HALE, and\r\nwho expresses himself upon the subject in these words: \"The reason why a\r\nman in extreme necessity may, _without incurring the guilt of theft or\r\nrapine_, forcibly take the goods of others for his present relief, is\r\nbecause his condition _renders all things common_. For it is the ordinance\r\nand institution of nature itself, that inferior things should be designed\r\nand directed to serve the necessities of men. Wherefore the division of\r\ngoods afterwards introduced into the world doth not derogate from that\r\nprecept of natural reason, which Suggests, that the _extreme wants of\r\nmankind may be in any manner removed by the use of temporal possessions_.\"\r\nPUFFENDORF tells us, that PERESIUS maintains, that, in case of extreme\r\nnecessity, a man is compelled to the action, by a force which he cannot\r\nresist; and then, that the owner's consent may be presumed on, because\r\nhumanity obliges him to succour those who are in distress. The same writer\r\ncites a passage from St. AMBROSE, one of the FATHERS of the church, which\r\nalleges that (in case of refusing to give to persons in extreme necessity)\r\nit is the person who retains the goods who is guilty of the act of wrong\r\ndoing, for St. AMBROSE says; \"it is the _bread of the hungry_ which you\r\ndetain; it is the _raiment of the naked_ which you lock up.\"\r\n\r\n43. Before I come to the English authorities on the same side, let me\r\nagain notice the foul dealing of Blackstone; let me point out another\r\ninstance or two of the insincerity of this English court-sycophant, who\r\nwas, let it be noted, Solicitor-general to the queen of the \"good old\r\nKing.\" You have seen, in paragraph 28, a most flagrant instance of his\r\nperversion of the Scriptures. He garbles the word of God, and prefaces the\r\ngarbling by calling it a thing \"_certified_ by King Solomon himself;\" and\r\nthis word _certified_ he makes use of just when he is about to begin the\r\nscandalous falsification of the text which he is referring to. Never was\r\nanything more base. But, the whole extent of the baseness we have not yet\r\nseen; for, BLACKSTONE had read HALE, who had quoted the two verses fairly;\r\nbut besides this, he had read PUFFENDORF, who had noticed very fully this\r\ntext of Scripture, and who had shown very clearly that it did not at all\r\nmake in favour of the doctrine of Blackstone. Blackstone ought to have\r\ngiven the argument of PUFFENDORF; he ought to have given the whole of his\r\nargument; but particularly he ought to have given this explanation of the\r\npassage in the PROVERBS, which explanation I have inserted in paragraph\r\n27. It was also the height of insincerity in BLACKSTONE, to pretend that\r\nthe passage from CICERO had anything at all to do with the matter. He knew\r\nwell that it had not; he knew that CICERO contemplated no case of extreme\r\nnecessity for want of food or clothing; but, he had read PUFFENDORF, and\r\nPUFFENDORF had told him, that CICERO'S was a question of the mere\r\n_conveniences_ and _inconveniences_ of life in general; and not a question\r\nof pinching hunger or shivering nakedness. BLACKSTONE had seen his fallacy\r\nexposed by PUFFENDORF; he had seen the misapplication of this passage of\r\nCICERO fully exposed by PUFFENDORF; and yet the base court-sycophant\r\ntrumped it up again, without mentioning PUFFENDORF'S exposure of the\r\nfallacy! In short this BLACKSTONE, upon this occasion, as upon almost all\r\nothers, has gone all lengths; has set detection and reproof at defiance,\r\nfor the sake of making his court to the government by inculcating\r\nharshness in the application of the law, and by giving to the law such an\r\ninterpretation as would naturally tend to justify that harshness.\r\n\r\n44. Let us now cast away from us this insincere sycophant, and turn to\r\nother law authorities of our own country. The _Mirrour of Justices_,\r\n(quoted by me in paragraph 14,) Chap. 4, Section 16, on the subject of\r\narrest of judgment of death, has this passage. Judgment is to be staid in\r\nseven cases here specified: and the seventh is this: \"in POVERTY, in which\r\ncase you are to distinguish of the poverty of the offender, or of things;\r\nfor if poor people, _to avoid famine, take victuals to sustain their\r\nlives, or clothes that they die not of cold_, (so that they perish if they\r\nkeep not themselves from cold,) _they are not to be adjudged to death, if\r\nit were not in their power to have bought their victuals or clothes_; for\r\nas much as _they are warranted so to do by the law of nature_.\" Now, my\r\nfriends, you will observe, that I take this from a book which may almost\r\nbe called the BIBLE of the law. There is no lawyer who will deny the\r\ngoodness of this authority; or who will attempt to say that this was not\r\nalways the law of England.\r\n\r\n45. Our next authority is one quite as authentic, and almost as ancient.\r\nThe book goes by the name of BRITTON, which was the name of a Bishop of\r\nHereford, who edited it, in the famous reign of EDWARD THE FIRST. The book\r\ndoes, in fact, contain the laws of the kingdom as they existed at that\r\ntime. It may be called the record of the laws of Edward the First. It\r\nbegins thus, \"Edward by the grace of God, King of England and Lord of\r\nIreland, to all his liege subjects, peace, and grace of salvation.\" The\r\npreamble goes on to state, that people cannot be happy without good laws;\r\nthat even good laws are of no use unless they be known and understood; and\r\nthat, therefore, the king has ordered the laws of England thus to be\r\nwritten and recorded. This book is very well known to be of the greatest\r\nauthority, amongst lawyers, and in Chap. 10 of this book, in which the law\r\ndescribes what constitutes a BURGLAR, or house-breaker, and the punishment\r\nthat he shall suffer (which is that of death,) there is this passage:\r\n\"Those are to be deemed burglars who feloniously, in time of peace, break\r\ninto churches or houses, or through walls or doors of our cities, or our\r\nboroughs; with _exception_ of children under age, and of _poor people who\r\nfor hunger, enter to take any sort of victuals of less value than twelve\r\npence_; and except idiots and mad people, and others that cannot commit\r\nfelony.\" Thus, you see, this agrees with the MIRROUR OF JUSTICES, and with\r\nall that we have read before from these numerous high authorities. But\r\nthis, taken in its full latitude, goes a great length indeed; for a\r\nburglar is a _breaker-in by night_. So that this is not only _a taking_;\r\nbut a breaking into a house in order to take! And observe, it is taking to\r\nthe value of _twelve pence_; and twelve pence then was the price of _a\r\ncouple of sheep_, and of fine fat sheep too; nay, twelve pence was the\r\nprice of _an ox_, in this very reign of Edward the First. So that, a\r\nhungry man might have a pretty good belly-full in those days without\r\nrunning the risk of punishment. Observe, by-the-by, how time has hardened\r\nthe law. We are told of the _dark ages_, of the _barbarous customs_, of\r\nour forefathers: and we have a SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH to receive and to\r\npresent petitions innumerable, from the most tender hearted creatures in\r\nthe world, about \"_softening the criminal code_;\" but, not a word do they\r\never say about a softening of _this law_, which now hangs a man for\r\nstealing the value of a RABBIT, and which formerly did not hang him till\r\nhe stole the value of an OX! Curious enough, but still more scandalous,\r\nthat we should have the impudence to talk of our _humanity_, and our\r\n_civilization_, and of the barbarousness of our forefathers. But, if a\r\n_part_ of the ancient law remain, shall not the _whole_ of it remain? If\r\nwe hang the thief, still hang the thief for stealing to the value of\r\n_twelve pence_; though the twelve pence now represents a rabbit instead of\r\nan ox; if we still do this, would BLACKSTONE take away the benefit of the\r\nancient law from the starving man? The passage that I have quoted is of\r\nsuch great importance as to this question, that I think it necessary to\r\nadd, here, a copy of the original, which is in the old _Norman-French_, of\r\nwhich I give the translation above. \"Sunt tenus burgessours trestous ceux,\r\nque felonisement en temps de pees debrusent esglises ou auter mesons, ou\r\nmurs, ou portes de nos cytes, ou de nos burghes; hors pris enfauntz dedans\r\nage, et poures, que, pur feyn, entret pur ascun vitaille de meindre value\r\nq'de xii deners, et hors pris fous nastres, et gens arrages, et autres que\r\nseuent nule felonie faire.\"\r\n\r\n46. After this, _lawyers_, at any rate, will not attempt to gainsay. If\r\nthere should, however, remain any one to affect to doubt of the soundness\r\nof this doctrine, let them take the following from him who is always\r\ncalled the \"_pride of philosophy_,\" the \"_pride of English learning_,\" and\r\nwhom the poet POPE calls \"_greatest_ and _wisest_ of mankind.\" It is LORD\r\nBACON of whom I am speaking. He was Lord High Chancellor in the reign of\r\nJames the First; and, let it be observed, that he wrote those \"_law\r\ntracts_,\" from which I am about to quote, long after the present poor-laws\r\nhad been established. He says (Law Tracts, page 55,) \"The law chargeth no\r\nman with default where the act is compulsory and not voluntary, and where\r\nthere is not consent and election; and, therefore, if either there be an\r\nimpossibility for a man to do otherwise, or so great a perturbation of the\r\njudgment and reason, as in presumption of law a man's nature cannot\r\novercome, such necessity carrieth a privilege in itself.--Necessity is of\r\nthree sorts: necessity of conservation of life; necessity of obedience;\r\nand necessity of the act of God or of a stranger.--First, of conservation\r\nof life; _if a man steal viands (victuals) to satisfy his present hunger_,\r\nthis is _no felony_ nor _larceny_.\"\r\n\r\n47. If any man want more authority, his heart must be hard indeed; he must\r\nhave an uncommonly anxious desire to take away by the halter the life that\r\nsought to preserve itself against hunger. But, after all, what need had we\r\nof any _authorities_? What need had we even of _reason_ upon the subject?\r\nWho is there upon the face of the earth, except the monsters that come\r\nfrom across the channel of St. George; who is there upon the face of the\r\nearth, except those monsters, that have the brass, the hard hearts and the\r\nbrazen faces, which enable them coolly to talk of the \"MERIT\" of the\r\ndegraded creatures, who, amidst an abundance of food, amidst a\r\n\"_superabundance of food_,\" lie quietly down and receive the extreme\r\nunction, and expire with hunger? Who, upon the face of the whole earth,\r\nexcept these monsters, these ruffians by way of excellence; who, except\r\nthese, the most insolent and hard-hearted ruffians that ever lived, will\r\ncontend, or will dare to think, that there ought to be any force under\r\nheaven to compel a man to lie down at the door of a baker's and butcher's\r\nshop, and expire with hunger! The very nature of man makes him shudder at\r\nthe thought. There want no authorities; no appeal to law books; no\r\narguments; no questions of right or wrong: that same human nature that\r\ntells me that I am not to cut my neighbour's throat, and drink his blood,\r\ntells me that I am not to make him die at my feet by keeping from him food\r\nor raiment of which I have more than I want for my own preservation.\r\n\r\n48. Talk of barbarians, indeed; Talk of \"_the dark_ and _barbarous ages_.\"\r\nWhy, even in the days of the DRUIDS, such barbarity as that of putting men\r\nto death, or of punishing them for taking to relieve their hunger, was\r\nnever thought of. In the year 1811, the REV. PETER ROBERTS, A. M.\r\npublished a book, entitled COLLECTANEA CAMBRICA. In the first volume of\r\nthat book, there is an account of the laws of the ANCIENT BRITONS. Hume,\r\nand other Scotchmen, would make us believe, that the ancient inhabitants\r\nof this country were a set of savages, clothed in skins and the like. The\r\nlaws of this people were collected and put into writing, in the year 694\r\n_before Christ_. The following extract from these laws shows, that the\r\nmoment civil society began to exist, that moment the law _took care that\r\npeople should not be starved to death_. That moment it took care, that\r\nprovision should be made for the destitute, or that, in cases of extreme\r\nnecessity, men were to preserve themselves from death by taking from those\r\nwho had to spare. The words of these laws (as applicable to our case)\r\ngiven by Mr. ROBERTS, are as follows:--\"There are three distinct kinds of\r\npersonal individual property, which cannot be shared with another, or\r\nsurrendered in payment of fine; viz., a wife, a child, and argyfrew. By\r\nthe word _argyfrew_ is meant, clothes, arms, or the implements of a lawful\r\ncalling. For without these a man has not the means of support, and it\r\nwould be _unjust_ in the law to _unman_ a man, or to _uncall_ a man as to\r\nhis calling.\" TRIAD 53d.--\"Three kinds of THIEVES are not to be punished\r\nwith DEATH. 1. A wife, who joins with her husband in theft. 2. A youth\r\nunder age. And 3. One who, after he has _asked, in vain_, for support, in\r\n_three towns_, and at _nine houses_ in each town.\" TRIAD 137.\r\n\r\n49. There were, then, _houses_ and _towns_, it seems; and the towns were\r\npretty thickly spread too; and, as to \"_civilization_\" and \"_refinement_,\"\r\nlet this law relative to a _youth under age_, be compared with the new\r\n_orchard and garden law_, and with the tread-mill affair, and new trespass\r\nlaw!\r\n\r\n50. We have a law, called the VAGRANT ACT, to _punish men for begging_. We\r\nhave a law to punish men for _not working to keep their families_. Now,\r\nwith what show of justice can these laws be maintained? They are founded\r\nupon this; the first, that begging is disgraceful to the country; that it\r\nis degrading to the character of man, and, of course, to the character of\r\nan Englishman; and, that there is no necessity for begging, _because the\r\nlaw has made ample provision for every person in distress_. The law for\r\npunishing men for not working to maintain their families is founded on\r\nthis, that they are _doing wrong to their neighbours_; their neighbours,\r\nthat is to say, the parish, being _bound to keep the family_, if they be\r\nnot kept by the man's labour; and, therefore, his not labouring is _a\r\nwrong done to the parish_. The same may be said with regard to the\r\npunishment for not maintaining bastard children. There is some reason for\r\nthese laws, as long as the poor-laws are duly executed; as long as the\r\npoor are duly relieved, according to law; but, unless the poor-laws exist;\r\nunless they be in full force; unless they be duly executed; unless\r\nefficient and prompt relief be given to necessitous persons, these acts,\r\nand many others approaching to a similar description, are acts of\r\nbarefaced and most abominable tyranny. I should say that they _would be_\r\nacts of such tyranny; for generally speaking, the poor-laws are, as yet,\r\nfairly executed, and efficient as to their object.\r\n\r\n51. The law of this country is, that every man, able to carry arms, is\r\nliable to be called on, to serve in the militia, or to serve as a soldier\r\nin some way or other, _in order to defend the country_. What, then, the\r\nman has _no land_; he has _no property_ beyond his mere body, and clothes,\r\nand tools; he has nothing that an enemy can take away from him. What\r\n_justice_ is there, then, in calling upon this man to take up arms and\r\n_risk his life_ in the _defence of the land_: what is the land to him? I\r\n_say_, that it is something to him; I _say_, that he ought to be called\r\nforth to assist to defend the land; because, however poor he may be, _he\r\nhas a share in the land_, through the poor-rates; and if he be liable to\r\nbe called forth to defend the land, _the land is always liable to be taxed\r\nfor his support_. This is what _I say_: my opinions are consistent with\r\nreason, with justice, and with the law of the land; but, how can MALTHUS\r\nand his silly and _nasty_ disciples; how can those who want to abolish the\r\npoor-rates or to prevent the poor from marrying; how can this at once\r\nstupid and conceited tribe look the labouring man in the face, while they\r\ncall upon him to take up arms, to risk his life, in defence of the land?\r\nGrant that the poor-laws are just; grant that every necessitous creature\r\nhas a right to demand relief from some parish or other; grant that the law\r\nhas most effectually provided that every man shall be protected against\r\nthe effects of hunger and of cold; grant these, and then the law which\r\ncompels the man without house or land to take up arms and risk his life in\r\ndefence of the country, is a perfectly just law; but, deny to the\r\nnecessitous that legal and certain relief of which I have been speaking;\r\nabolish the poor laws; and then this military-service law becomes an act\r\nof a character such as I defy any pen or tongue to describe.\r\n\r\n52. To say another word upon the subject is certainly unnecessary; but we\r\nlive in days when \"_stern necessity_\" has so often been pleaded for most\r\nflagrant departures from the law of the land, that one cannot help asking,\r\nwhether there were any greater necessity to justify ADDINGTON for his\r\ndeeds of 1817 than there would be to justify a starving man in taking a\r\nloaf? ADDINGTON pleaded _necessity_, and he got a Bill of _Indemnity_.\r\nAnd, shall a starving man be hanged, then, if he take a loaf to save\r\nhimself from dying? When SIX ACTS were before the Parliament, the\r\nproposers and supporters of them never pretended that they did not\r\nembrace a most dreadful departure from the ancient laws of the land. In\r\nanswer to LORD HOLLAND, who had dwelt forcibly on this departure from the\r\nancient law, the Lord Chancellor, unable to contradict LORD HOLLAND,\r\nexclaimed, \"_Salus populi suprema lex_,\" that is to say \"_The salvation of\r\nthe people is the first law_.\" Well, then, if the salvation of the people\r\nbe the first law, the _salvation of life_ is really and bona fide the\r\nsalvation of the people; and, if the ordinary laws may be dispensed with,\r\nin order to obviate a possible and speculative danger, surely they may be\r\ndispensed with, in cases where to dispense with them is visibly,\r\ndemonstrably, notoriously, necessary to the salvation of _the lives_ of\r\nthe people: surely, bread is as necessary to the lips of the starving man,\r\nas a new law could be necessary to prevent either house of parliament from\r\nbeing brought into _contempt_; and surely, therefore, _Salus populi\r\nsuprema lex_ may come from the lips of the famishing people with as much\r\npropriety as they came from those of the Lord Chancellor!\r\n\r\n53. Again, however, I observe, and with this I conclude, that we have\r\nnothing to do but to adhere to the poor-laws which we have; that the poor\r\nhave nothing to do, but to apply to the overseer, or to appeal from him to\r\nthe magistrate; that the magistrate has nothing to do but duly to enforce\r\nthe law; and that the government has nothing to do, in order to secure the\r\npeace of the country, amidst all the difficulties that are approaching,\r\ngreat and numerous as they are; that it has nothing to do, but to enjoin\r\non the magistrates to do their duty according to our excellent law; and,\r\nat the same time, the government ought to discourage, by all the means in\r\ntheir power, all projects for maintaining the poor _by any other than\r\nlegal means_; to discourage all begging-box affairs; all miserable\r\nexpedients; and also to discourage, and, where it is possible, fix its\r\nmark of reprobation upon all those detestable projectors, who are hatching\r\nschemes for what is called, in the blasphemous slang of the day,\r\n\"_checking the surplus population_\" who are hatching schemes for\r\n_preventing the labouring people from having children_: who are about\r\nspreading their nasty beastly publications; who are hatching schemes of\r\n_emigration_; and who, in short, seem to be doing every-thing in their\r\npower to widen the fearful breach that has already been made between the\r\npoor and the rich. The government has nothing to do but to cause the law\r\nto be honestly enforced; and then we shall see no starvation, and none of\r\nthose dreadful conflicts which the fear of want, as well as actual want,\r\nnever fail to produce. The bare thought of _forced emigration_ to a\r\nforeign state, including, as it must, a _transfer of all allegiance_,\r\nwhich is contrary to the fundamental laws of England; or, exposing every\r\nemigrating person to the danger of committing _high treason_; the very\r\nthought of such a measure, _having become necessary in England_, is enough\r\nto make an Englishman mad. But, of these projects, these scandalous nasty\r\nbeastly and shameless projects, we shall have time to speak hereafter; and\r\nin the mean while, I take my leave of you, for the present, by expressing\r\nmy admiration of the sensible and spirited conduct of the people of\r\nSTOCKPORT, when an attempt was, on the 5th of September, made to cheat\r\nthem into an address, _applauding the conduct of the Ministers_! What! Had\r\nthe people of STOCKPORT so soon forgotten _16th of August_! Had they so\r\nsoon forgotten their townsman, JOSEPH SWAN! If they had, they would have\r\ndeserved to perish to all eternity. Oh, no! It was a proposition _very\r\npremature_: it will be quite soon enough for the good and sensible and\r\nspirited fellows of STOCKPORT; quite soon enough to address the Ministers,\r\nwhen the Ministers shall have proposed a repeal of the several Jubilee\r\nmeasures, called Ellenborough's law; the poacher-transporting law; the\r\nsun-set and sun-rise transportation law; the tread-mill law; the\r\nselect-vestry law; the Sunday-toll laws; the new trespass law; the new\r\ntreason law; the seducing-soldier-hanging law; the new apple-felony law;\r\nthe SIX ACTS; and a great number of others, passed in the reign of\r\nJubilee. Quite soon enough to applaud, that is, for the sensible people of\r\nSTOCKPORT to applaud, the Ministers, when those Ministers have proposed to\r\nrepeal these laws, and, also, to repeal the _malt tax_, and _those other\r\ntaxes_, which take, even from the pauper, one half of what the parish\r\ngives him to keep the breath warm in his body. Quite soon enough to\r\napplaud the Ministers, when they have done these things; and when in\r\naddition to all these, they shall have openly proposed _a radical reform\r\nof the Commons House of Parliament_. Leaving them to do this as soon as\r\nthey like, and trusting, that you will never, on any account, applaud them\r\nuntil they do it, I, expressing here my best thanks to Mr. BLACKSHAW, who\r\ndefeated the slavish scheme at Stockport, remain,\r\n\r\n  Your faithful friend,\r\n  and most obedient servant,\r\n  WM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hurstbourne Tarrant (called Uphusband,)_\r\n\r\n_Hants, 13th October, 1826._\r\n\r\nMY EXCELLENT FRIENDS,\r\n\r\n54. In the foregoing Numbers, I have shown, that men can never be so poor\r\nas to have no rights at all: and that, in England, they have a legal, as\r\nwell as a natural, _right_ to be maintained, if they be destitute of other\r\nmeans, out of the lands, or other property, of the rich. But, it is an\r\ninteresting question, HOW THERE CAME TO BE SO MUCH POVERTY AND MISERY IN\r\nENGLAND. This is a very interesting question; for, though it is the doom\r\nof man, that he shall never be certain of any-thing, and that he shall\r\nnever be beyond the reach of calamity; though there always has been, and\r\nalways will be, poor people in every nation; though this circumstance of\r\npoverty is inseparable from the means which uphold communities of men;\r\nthough, without poverty, there could be _no charity_, and none of those\r\nfeelings, those offices, those acts, and those relationships, which are\r\nconnected with charity, and which form a considerable portion of the\r\ncement of civil society: yet, notwithstanding these things, there are\r\nbounds beyond which the poverty of the people cannot go, without becoming\r\na thing to complain of, and to trace to the Government as a fault. Those\r\nbounds have been passed, in England, long and long ago. England was always\r\nfamed for many things; but especially for its _good living_; that is to\r\nsay, for the _plenty_ in which the whole of the people lived; for the\r\nabundance of good clothing and good food which they had. It was always,\r\never since it _bore the name of England_, the richest and most powerful\r\nand most admired country in Europe; but, its _good living_, its\r\nsuperiority in this particular respect, was proverbial amongst all who\r\nknew, or who had heard talk of, the English nation. Good God! How changed!\r\nNow, the very worst fed and worst clad people upon the face of the earth,\r\nthose of Ireland only excepted. _How, then, did this horrible, this\r\ndisgraceful, this cruel poverty come upon this once happy nation?_ This,\r\nmy good friends of Preston, is, to us all, a most important question; and,\r\nnow let us endeavour to obtain a full and complete answer to it.\r\n\r\n55. POVERTY is, after all, the great badge, the never-failing badge, of\r\nslavery. Bare bones and rags are the true marks of the real slave. What is\r\nthe object of Government? To cause men to live _happily_. They cannot be\r\nhappy without a sufficiency of _food_ and of _raiment_. Good government\r\nmeans a state of things in which the main body are well fed and well\r\nclothed. It is the chief business of a government to take care, that one\r\npart of the people do not cause the other part to lead miserable lives.\r\nThere can be no morality, no virtue, no sincerity, no honesty, amongst a\r\npeople continually suffering from want; and, it is cruel, in the last\r\ndegree, to punish such people for almost any sort of crime, which is, in\r\nfact, not crime of the heart, not crime of the perpetrator, but the crime\r\nof his all-controlling necessities.--To what degree the main body of the\r\npeople, in England, _are now_ poor and miserable; how deplorably wretched\r\nthey now are; this we know but too well; and now, we will see what was\r\ntheir state before this vaunted \"REFORMATION.\" I shall be very particular\r\nto cite my _authorities_ here. I will _infer_ nothing; I will give no\r\n\"_estimate_;\" but refer to authorities, such as no man can call in\r\nquestion, such as no man can deny to be proofs _more_ complete than if\r\nfounded on oaths of credible witnesses, taken before a judge and jury. I\r\nshall begin with the account which FORTESCUE gives of the state and manner\r\nof living of the English, in the reign of Henry VI.; that is, in the 15th\r\ncentury, when the Catholic Church was in the height of its glory.\r\nFORTESCUE was Lord Chief Justice of England for nearly twenty years; he\r\nwas appointed Lord High Chancellor by Henry VI. Being in exile, in France,\r\nin consequence of the wars between the Houses of York and Lancaster, and\r\nthe King's son, Prince Edward, being also in exile with him, the\r\nChancellor wrote a series of Letters, addressed to the Prince, to explain\r\nto him the nature and effects of the Laws of England, and to induce him to\r\nstudy them and uphold them. This work, which was written in Latin, is\r\ncalled _De Laudibus Legum Angliae_; or, PRAISE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND. This\r\nbook was, many years ago, translated into English, and it is a book of\r\nLaw-Authority, quoted frequently in our courts of this day. No man can\r\ndoubt the truth of _facts_ related in such a work. It was a work written\r\nby a famous lawyer for a prince; it was intended to be read by other\r\ncontemporary lawyers, and also by all lawyers in future. The passage that\r\nI am about to quote, relating to the state of the English, was _purely\r\nincidental_; it was not intended to answer any temporary purpose. It _must\r\nhave been a true account_.--The Chancellor, after speaking generally of\r\nthe nature of the laws of England, and of the difference between them and\r\nthe laws of France, proceeds to show the difference in their effects, by a\r\ndescription of the state of the French people, and then by a description\r\nof the state of the English. His words, words that, as I transcribe them,\r\nmake my cheeks burn with shame, are as follows: \"Besides all this, the\r\ninhabitants of France give every year to their King the _fourth part_ of\r\nall their _wines_, the growth of that year, every vintner gives the fourth\r\npenny of what he makes of his wine by sale. And all the towns and boroughs\r\npay to the King yearly great sums of money, which are assessed upon them,\r\nfor the expenses of his men at arms. So that the King's troops, which are\r\nalways considerable, are substituted and paid yearly by those common\r\npeople, who live in the villages, boroughs, and cities. Another grievance\r\nis, every village constantly finds and maintains two _cross-bow-men_, at\r\nthe least; some find more, well arrayed in all their accoutrements, to\r\nserve the King in his wars, as often as he pleaseth to call them out,\r\nwhich is frequently done. Without any consideration had of these things,\r\nother very heavy taxes are assessed yearly upon every village within the\r\nkingdom, for the King's service; _neither is there ever any intermission\r\nor abatement of taxes_. Exposed to these and other calamities, the\r\npeasants live in great hardship and misery. Their _constant drink is\r\nwater_, neither do they taste, throughout the year, any other liquor,\r\nunless upon some extraordinary times, or festival days. Their clothing\r\nconsists of _frocks_, or little short _jerkins_, made of canvass, no\r\nbetter than common _sackcloth_; they _do not wear any woollens_, except of\r\nthe _coarsest sort_; and that only in the garment under their frocks; nor\r\ndo they wear any trowse, but from the knees upwards; their legs being\r\nexposed and naked. The women go barefoot, except on holidays. They do _not\r\neat flesh_, except it be the fat of bacon, and _that in very small\r\nquantities_, with which they make _a soup_. Of other sorts, either boiled\r\nor roasted, _they do not so much as taste_, unless it be of the inwards\r\nand offals of sheep and bullocks, and the like which are killed, for the\r\nuse of the better sort of people, _and the merchants_; for whom also\r\nquails, _partridges_, _hares_, and the like, _are reserved, upon pain of\r\nthe gallies_; as for their poultry, _the soldiers consume them_, so that\r\nscarce the eggs, slight as they are, are indulged them, by way of a\r\ndainty. And if it happen that a man is observed to thrive in the world,\r\nand become rich, he is _presently assessed to the King's tax_,\r\nproportionably more than his poorer neighbours, _whereby he is soon\r\nreduced to a level with the rest_.\" Then comes his description of the\r\nENGLISH, at the same time; those \"priest-ridden\" English, whom CHALMERS\r\nand HUME, and the rest of that tribe, would fain have us believe, were a\r\nmere band of wretched beggars.--\"The King of England cannot alter the\r\nlaws, or make new ones, without the express consent of _the whole kingdom\r\nin Parliament assembled_. Every inhabitant is at his liberty fully to use\r\nand enjoy whatever his farm produceth, the fruits of the earth, the\r\nincrease of his flock, and the like: all the improvements he makes,\r\nwhether by his own proper industry, or of those he retains in his service,\r\nare his own, to use and enjoy, without the let, interruption, or denial of\r\nany. If he be in anywise injured or oppressed, he shall have his amends\r\nand satisfactions against the party offending. Hence it is that the\r\ninhabitants are _rich in gold, silver_, and in all the necessaries and\r\nconveniences of life. _They drink no water_, unless at certain times, upon\r\n_a religious score_, and by way of doing penance. They _are fed, in great\r\nabundance_, with _all sorts of flesh_ and _fish_, of which _they have\r\nplenty every-where_; they are _clothed throughout in good woollens_; their\r\nbedding and other furniture in their houses _are of wool_, and that _in\r\ngreat store_. They are also well provided with all other sorts of\r\nhousehold goods and necessary implements for husbandry. Every one,\r\naccording to his rank, hath _all things which conduce to make life easy\r\nand happy_.\"--Go, and read this to the poor souls, who are now eating\r\nsea-weed in Ireland; who are detected in robbing the pig-troughs in\r\nYorkshire; who are eating horse-flesh and grains (draff) in Lancashire\r\nand Cheshire; who are harnessed like horses, and drawing gravel in\r\nHampshire and Sussex; who have 3_d._ a day allowed them by the magistrates\r\nin Norfolk; who are, all over England, worse fed than the _felons_ in the\r\njails. Go, and tell them, when they raise their hands from the pig-trough,\r\nor from the grains-tub, and, with their dirty tongues, cry \"_No Popery_;\"\r\ngo, read to the degraded and deluded wretches, this account of the state\r\nof their _Catholic_ forefathers, who lived under what is impudently called\r\n\"_Popish superstition and tyranny_,\" and in those times which we have the\r\naudacity to call \"_the dark ages_.\"--Look at the _then_ picture of the\r\nFrench; and, Protestant Englishmen, if you have the capacity of blushing\r\nleft, blush at the thought of how precisely that picture fits the English\r\n_now_! Look at _all the parts_ of the picture; the _food_, the _raiment_,\r\nthe _game_! Good God! If any one had told the old Chancellor, that the day\r\nwould come, when this picture, and even a picture more degrading to human\r\nnature, would fit his own boasted country, what would he have said? What\r\nwould he have said, if he had been told, that the time was to come, when\r\nthe soldier, in England, would have more than twice, nay, more than\r\nthrice, the sum allowed to the day-labouring man; when potatoes would be\r\ncarried to the field as the only food of the ploughman; when soup-shops\r\nwould be open to feed the English; and when the Judges, sitting on that\r\nvery Bench on which he himself had sitten for twenty years, would (as in\r\nthe case of last year of the complaints against Magistrates at\r\nNORTHALLERTON) declare that BREAD AND WATER were the general food of\r\nworking people in England? What would he have said? Why, if he had been\r\ntold, that there was to be a \"REFORMATION,\" accompanied by a total\r\ndevastation of Church and Poor property, upheld by wars, creating an\r\nenormous Debt and enormous taxes, and requiring a constantly standing\r\narmy; if he had been told this, he would have foreseen our present state,\r\nand would have wept for his country; but, if he had, in addition, been\r\ntold, that, even in the midst of all this suffering, we should still have\r\nthe ingratitude and the baseness to cry \"_No Popery_,\" and the injustice\r\nand the cruelty to persecute those Englishmen and Irishmen, who adhered to\r\nthe faith of their pious, moral, brave, free and happy fathers, he would\r\nhave said, \"God's will be done: let them suffer.\"--But, it may be said,\r\nthat it was not, then, the _Catholic Church_, but the _Laws_, that made\r\nthe English so happy; for, the French had that Church as well as the\r\nEnglish. Aye! But, in England, the Church was the very _basis of the\r\nlaws_. The very first clause of MAGNA CHARTA provided for the stability of\r\nits property and rights. _A provision for the indigent_, an effectual\r\nprovision, was made _by the laws_ that related to the Church and its\r\nproperty; and this was not the case in France; and never was the case in\r\nany country but this: so that the English people lost more by a\r\n\"Reformation\" than any other people could have lost.--Fortescue's\r\nauthority would, of itself, be enough; but, I am not to stop with it.\r\nWHITE, the late Rector of SELBOURNE, in Hampshire, gives, in his History\r\nof that once-famous village, an extract from a record, stating that for\r\ndisorderly conduct, men were _punished_ by being \"compelled to _fast_ a\r\nfortnight on _bread and beer_!\" This was about the year 1380, in the reign\r\nof RICHARD II. Oh! miserable \"_dark ages_!\" This fact _must be true_.\r\nWHITE had no purpose to answer. His mention of the fact, or rather his\r\ntranscript from the record, is purely _incidental_; and trifling as the\r\nfact is, it is conclusive as to the general mode of living in those happy\r\ndays. Go, tell the harnessed gravel-drawers, in Hampshire, to cry \"_No\r\nPopery_;\" for, that, if the Pope be not put down, he may, in time, compel\r\nthem to _fast_ on _bread and beer_, instead of suffering them to continue\r\nto regale themselves on nice potatoes and pure water.--But, let us come to\r\n_Acts of Parliament_, and, first, to the Act above mentioned of KING\r\nEDWARD III. That Act fixes the _price of meat_. After naming the four\r\nsorts of meat, _beef_, _pork_, _mutton_, and _veal_, the preamble has\r\nthese words: \"These being THE FOOD OF THE POORER SORT.\" This is\r\nconclusive. It is an _incidental_ mention of a fact. It is an Act of\r\nParliament. It _must have been true_; and, it is a fact that we know well,\r\nthat even the Judges have declared from the Bench, that _bread alone_ is\r\n_now the food of the poorer sort_. What do we want more than this to\r\nconvince us, that the main body of the people have been _impoverished_ by\r\nthe \"Reformation?\"--But I will _prove_, by other Acts of Parliament, this\r\nAct of Parliament to have spoken truth. These Acts declare what the\r\n_wages_ of workmen shall be. There are several such Acts, but one or two\r\nmay suffice. The Act of 23d of EDW. III. fixes the wages, without food, as\r\nfollows. There are many other things mentioned, but the following will be\r\nenough for our purpose.\r\n\r\n                                                    _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  A woman hay-making, or weeding corn, for the day   0    1\r\n  A man filling dung-cart                            0    3-1/2\r\n  A reaper                                           0    4\r\n  Mowing an acre of grass                            0    6\r\n  Thrashing a quarter of Wheat                       0    4\r\n\r\nThe price of _shoes_, _cloth_, and of _provisions_, throughout the time\r\nthat this law continued in force, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                   _L._ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  A pair of shoes                   0    0    4\r\n  Russet broad-cloth the yard       0    1    1\r\n  A stall-fed ox                    1    4    0\r\n  A grass-fed ox                    0   16    0\r\n  A fat sheep unshorn               0    1    8\r\n  A fat sheep shorn                 0    1    2\r\n  A fat hog 2 years old             0    3    4\r\n  A fat goose                       0    0    2-1/2\r\n  Ale, the gallon, by proclamation  0    0    1\r\n  Wheat the quarter                 0    3    4\r\n  White wine the gallon             0    0    6\r\n  Red wine                          0    0    4\r\n\r\nThese prices are taken from the PRECIOSUM of BISHOP FLEETWOOD, who took\r\nthem from the accounts kept by the bursers of convents. All the world\r\nknows, that FLEETWOOD'S book is of undoubted authority.--We may then\r\neasily believe, that \"beef, pork, mutton, and veal,\" were \"the food of the\r\n_poorer sort_,\" when a _dung-cart filler_ had more than the price of _a\r\nfat goose and a half for a day's work_, and when a woman was allowed, for\r\n_a day's weeding_, the price of a _quart of red wine_! Two yards of the\r\ncloth made a coat for the _shepherd_; and, as it cost 2_s._ 2_d._, the\r\nreaper would earn it _in 6-1/2 days_; and, the dung-cart man would earn\r\nvery nearly a _pair of shoes every day_! this dung-cart filler would earn\r\na _fat shorn sheep_ in four days; he would earn a _fat hog_, two years\r\nold, in twelve days; he would earn a _grass-fed ox_ in twenty days; so\r\nthat we may easily believe, that \"beef, pork, and mutton,\" were \"the food\r\nof the _poorer sort_.\" And, mind, this was \"a _priest-ridden people_;\" a\r\npeople \"buried in _Popish superstition_!\" In our days of \"_Protestant\r\nlight_\" and of \"_mental enjoyment_,\" the \"poorer sort\" are allowed by the\r\nMagistrates of Norfolk, 3_d._ a day for a _single man_ able to work. That\r\nis to say, a half-penny _less_ than the Catholic dung-cart man had; and\r\nthat 3_d._ will get the \"_No Popery_\" gentleman about _six ounces_ of old\r\newe-mutton, while the Popish dung-cart man got, for his day, rather more\r\nthan _the quarter of a fat sheep_.--But, the popish people might work\r\n_harder_ than \"_enlightened_ Protestants.\" They might do _more work in a\r\nday_. This is contrary to all the assertions of the _feelosophers_; for\r\nthey insist, that the Catholic religion made people _idle_. But, to set\r\nthis matter at rest, let us look at the price of the _job-labour_; at the\r\n_mowing_ by _the acre_, and at the _thrashing_ of wheat by _the quarter_;\r\nand let us see how these _wages are now_, compared with the price of food.\r\nI have no _parliamentary_ authority since the year 1821, when a report was\r\nprinted by order of the House of Commons, containing the evidence of Mr.\r\nELLMAN, of Sussex, as to wages, and of Mr. GEORGE, of Norfolk, as to price\r\nof wheat. The report was dated 18th June, 1821. The accounts are for 20\r\nyears, on an average, from 1800 inclusive. We will now proceed to see how\r\nthe \"popish, priest-ridden\" Englishman stands in comparison with the \"_No\r\nPopery_\" Englishman.\r\n\r\n                                 POPISH MAN.      NO POPERY MAN.\r\n\r\n                                   _s._ _d._        _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  Mowing an acre of grass           0    6           3    7-3/4\r\n  Thrashing a quarter of Wheat      0    4           4    0\r\n\r\nHere are \"_waust_ improvements, Mau'm!\" But, now let us look at the\r\nrelative _price of the wheat_, which the labourer had to purchase with his\r\nwages. We have seen, that the \"popish _superstition slave_\" had to give\r\n_fivepence_ a bushel for his wheat, and the evidence of Mr. GEORGE states,\r\nthat the \"_enlightened_ Protestant\" had to give 10 _shillings_ a bushel\r\nfor his wheat; that is 24 _times_ as much as the \"popish _fool_,\" who\r\nsuffered himself to be \"priest-ridden.\" So that the \"_enlightened_\" man,\r\nin order to make him as well off as the \"_dark_-ages\" man was, ought to\r\nreceive _twelve shillings_, instead of 3_s._ 7-3/4_d._ for mowing an acre\r\nof grass; and he, in like manner, ought to receive, for thrashing a\r\nquarter of wheat, _eight shillings_, instead of the _four shillings_ which\r\nhe does receive. If we had the _records_, we should doubtless find, that\r\nIRELAND was in the same state.\r\n\r\n56. There! That settles the matter as to _ancient_ good living. Now, as to\r\nthe progress of poverty and misery, amongst the working people, during the\r\nlast half century, take these facts; in the year 1771, that is, 55 years\r\nago, ARTHUR YOUNG, who was afterwards Secretary to the Board of\r\nAgriculture, published a work on the state of the agriculture of the\r\ncountry, in which he gave the allowance for the keeping of _a\r\nfarm-labourer, his wife and three children_, which allowance, reckoning\r\naccording to the present money-price of the articles which he allows\r\namounted to 13_s._ 1_d._ He put the sum, at what he deemed the _lowest\r\npossible sum_, on which the people could _exist_. Alas! we shall find,\r\nthat they can be made to exist upon little more than _one-half_ of this\r\nsum!\r\n\r\n57. This allowance of Mr. ARTHUR YOUNG was made, observe, in 1771, which\r\nwas before the Old American War took place. That war made some famous\r\nfortunes for admirals and commodores and contractors and pursers and\r\ngenerals and commissaries; but, it was not the Americans, the French, nor\r\nthe Dutch, that gave the money to make these fortunes. They came out of\r\n_English taxes_; and the heaviest part of those taxes fell upon the\r\n_working people_, who, when they were boasting of \"_victories_,\" and\r\nrejoicing that the \"JACK TARS\" had got \"prize-money,\" little dreamed that\r\nthese victories were purchased by them, and that they paid fifty pounds\r\nfor every crown that sailors got in prize-money! In short, this American\r\nwar caused a great mass of new taxes to be laid on, and the people of\r\nEngland became _a great deal poorer than they ever had been before_.\r\nDuring that war, they BEGAN TO EAT POTATOES, as something to \"_save\r\nbread_.\" The poorest of the people, the very poorest of them, refused, for\r\na long while, to use them in this way; and even when I was ten years old,\r\nwhich was just about _fifty years ago_; the poor people would not eat\r\npotatoes, except _with meat_, as they would cabbages, or carrots, or any\r\nother moist vegetable. But, by the end of the American war, their stomachs\r\nhad come to! By slow degrees they had been reduced to swallow this\r\npig-meat, (and bad pig-meat too,) not, indeed, without grumbling; but to\r\nswallow it; to be reduced, thus, many degrees in the scale of animals.\r\n\r\n58. At the end of _twenty-four years_ from the date of ARTHUR YOUNG'S\r\nallowance, the poverty and degradation of the English people had made\r\ngreat strides. We were now in the year 1795, and a new war, and a new\r\nseries of \"_victories_ and _prizes_\" had begun. But who it was that\r\n_suffered_ for these, out of whose blood and flesh and bones they came,\r\nthe allowance now (in 1795) made to the poor labourers and their families\r\nwill tell. There was, in that year, a TABLE, or SCALE, of allowance,\r\nframed by the Magistrates of Berkshire. This is, by no means, a _hard_\r\ncounty; and therefore it is reasonable to suppose, that the _scale_ was as\r\ngood a one for the poor as any in England. According to this scale, which\r\nwas printed and published, and also acted upon for years, the weekly\r\nallowance, for _a man, his wife and three children_, was, according to\r\npresent money-prices, 11_s._ 4_d._ Thus it had, in the space of\r\ntwenty-four years, fell from 13_s._ 1_d._ to 11_s._ 4_d._ Thus were the\r\npeople brought to the _pig-meat_! Food, fit for men, they could not have\r\nwith 11_s._ 4_d._ a week for five persons.\r\n\r\n59. One would have thought, that to make a human being _live_ upon 4_d._\r\n_a day_, and find _fuel_, _clothing_, _rent_, _washing_, and _bedding_,\r\nout of the 4_d._, besides eating and drinking, was impossible; and one\r\nwould have thought it impossible for any-thing not of hellish birth and\r\nbreeding, to entertain a wish to make poor creatures, and our _neighbours_\r\ntoo, exist in such a state of horrible misery and degradation as the\r\nlabourers of England were condemned to by this scale of 1795. Alas! this\r\nwas happiness and honour; this was famous living; this 11_s._ 4_d._ a week\r\nwas _luxury_ and _feasting_, compared to what we NOW BEHOLD! For now the\r\nallowance, according to present money-prices, is 8_s._ a week for the man,\r\nhis wife, and three children; that is to say 2-5/7 _d._ In words, TWO\r\nPENCE AND FIVE SEVENTHS OF ANOTHER PENNY, FOR A DAY! There, that is\r\nEngland now! That is what the base wretches, who are fattening upon the\r\npeople's labour, call \"the _envy_ of surrounding nations and the\r\n_admiration_ of the world.\" This is what SIR FRANCIS BURDETT applauds; and\r\nhe applauds the mean and cruel and dastardly ruffians, whom he calls, \"the\r\n_country gentlemen_ of England,\" and whose _generosity_ he cries up; while\r\nhe well knows, _that it is they_ (and he amongst the rest) who are the\r\nreal and only cause of this devil-like barbarity, which (and he well knows\r\nthat too) could not possibly be practised without the constant existence\r\nand occasional employment of that species of force, which is so abhorrent\r\nto the laws of England, and of which this Burdett's son forms a part. The\r\npoor creatures, _if they complain_; if their hunger make them _cry out_,\r\nare either punished by even harder measures, or are _slapped into prison_.\r\nAlas! the jail is really become a place of _relief_, a scene of\r\ncomparative _good living_: hence the invention of the _tread-mill_! What\r\nshall we see next? _Workhouses, badges, hundred-houses, select-vestries,\r\ntread-mills, gravel-carts, and harness!_ What shall we see next! And what\r\nshould we see at last, if this infernal THING could continue for only a\r\nfew years longer?\r\n\r\n60. In order to form a judgment of the cruelty of making our working\r\nneighbours live upon 2-5/7_d._ a day; that is to say 2_d._ and rather more\r\nthan a halfpenny, let us see what the surgeons allow in the hospitals, to\r\npatients with _broken limbs_, who, of course, have no _work_ to do, and\r\nwho cannot even take any _exercise_. In GUY'S HOSPITAL, London, the\r\n_daily_ allowance to patients, having _simple fractures_, is this: 6\r\nounces of meat; 12 ounces of bread; 1 pint of broth; 2 quarts of good\r\nbeer. This is the _daily_ allowance. Then, in addition to this, the same\r\npatient has 12 ounces of butter _a week_. These articles, for a week,\r\namount to not less at present retail prices (and those are the poor man's\r\nprices,) than 6_s._ 9_d._ a week; while the working man is allowed 1_s._\r\n7_d._ a week! For, he cannot and he will not see his wife and children\r\nactually drop down dead with hunger before his face; and this is what he\r\nmust see, if he take to himself more than a _fifth_ of the allowance for\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n61. Now, pray, observe, that _surgeons_, and particularly those eminent\r\nsurgeons who frame rules and regulations for great establishments like\r\nthat of Guy's Hospital, _are competent judges_ of what nature requires in\r\nthe way of food and of drink. They are, indeed, not only competent judges,\r\nbut they are the best of judges: they know precisely what is necessary;\r\nand having the power to order the proper allowance, they order it. If,\r\nthen, they make an allowance like that, which we have seen, to a person\r\nwho is under a regimen for a broken limb; to a person who does _no work_,\r\nand who is, nine times out of ten, unable to take any exercise at all,\r\neven that of walking about, at least in the open air; if the eminent\r\nsurgeons of London deem _six shillings and ninepence worth_ of victuals\r\nand drink, a week, necessary to such a patient; if they think that _nature\r\ncalls_ for so much in such a case; what must that man be made of, who can\r\nallow to a _working man_, a man fourteen hours every day in the open air,\r\n_one shilling and seven pence worth_ of victuals and drink for the week!\r\nLet me not however ask what \"that _man_\" can be made of; for it is a\r\nmonster and not a man: it is a murderer of men: not a murderer with the\r\nknife or the pistol, but with the more cruel instrument of starvation. And\r\nyet, such monsters go to _church_ and to _meeting_; aye, and _subscribe_,\r\nthe base hypocrites, to circulate that Bible which commands _to do as they\r\nwould be done by_, and which, from the first chapter to the last, menaces\r\nthem with punishment, if they be hard to the poor, the fatherless, the\r\nwidow, or the stranger!\r\n\r\n62. But, not only is the patient, in a hospital, thus so much more amply\r\nfed than the working man; the _prisoners in the jails_; aye, even the\r\n_convicted felons_, are fed better, and much better, than the working men\r\nnow are! Here is a fine \"_Old England_;\" that country of \"roast beef and\r\nplumb pudding:\" that, as the tax-eaters say it is, \"envy of surrounding\r\nnations and admiration of the world.\" Aye; the country WAS all these; but,\r\nit is now precisely the reverse of them all. We have just seen that the\r\n_honest labouring man_ is allowed 2-5/7_d._ a day; and that will buy him\r\n_a pound and a half of good bread a day_, and no more, not a single crumb\r\nmore. This is all he has. Well enough might the Hampshire Baronet, SIR\r\nJOHN POLLEN, lately, at a meeting at Andover, call the labourers \"_poor\r\ndevils_,\" and say, that they had \"_scarcely a rag to cover them_!\" A pound\r\nand a half of bread a day, and nothing more, and that, too, _to work\r\nupon_! Now, then, how fare the prisoners in the jails? Why, if they be\r\nCONVICTED FELONS, they are, say the Berkshire jail-regulations, \"to have\r\nONLY BREAD and water, _with vegetables_ occasionally from the garden.\"\r\nHere, then, they are already better fed than the honest labouring man.\r\nAye, and this is not all; for, this is only the _week-day_ fare; for, they\r\nare to have, \"on Sundays, SOME MEAT _and broth_!\" Good God! And the honest\r\nworking man can never, never smell the smell of meat! This is \"envy of\r\nsurrounding nations\" with the devil to it! This is a state of things for\r\nBurdett to applaud.\r\n\r\n63. But we are not even yet come to a sight of the depth of our\r\ndegradation. These Berkshire jail-regulations make provision for setting\r\nthe convicted prisoners, in certain cases, TO WORK, and, they say, \"if the\r\nsurgeon think it necessary, the WORKING PRISONERS may be allowed MEAT AND\r\nBROTH ON WEEK-DAYS;\" and on Sundays, of course! There it is! There is the\r\n\"envy and admiration!\" There is the state to which Mr. Prosperity and Mr.\r\nCanning's best Parliament has brought us. There is the result of\r\n\"_victories_\" and prize-money and battles of Waterloo and of English\r\nladies kissing, \"Old Blucher.\" There is the fruit, the natural fruit, of\r\nanti-jacobinism and battles on the Serpentine River and jubilees and\r\nheaven-born ministers and sinking-funds and \"public credit\" and army and\r\nnavy contracts. There is the fruit, the natural, the nearly (but _not\r\nquite_) ripe fruit of it all: the CONVICTED FELON is, if he do not work at\r\nall, allowed, on week-days, some vegetables in addition to his bread, and,\r\non Sundays, both _meat and broth_; and, if the CONVICTED FELON work, if he\r\nbe a WORKING convicted felon, he is allowed _meat and broth all the week\r\nround_; while, hear it Burdett, thou Berkshire magistrate! hear it, all ye\r\nbase miscreants who have persecuted men because they sought a reform! The\r\nWORKING CONVICTED FELON is allowed _meat and broth every day in the year_,\r\nwhile the WORKING HONEST MAN is allowed _nothing but dry bread_, and of\r\nthat not half a belly-full! And yet you see the people that seem\r\n_surprised_ that _crimes_ increase! Very strange, to be sure; that men\r\nshould like to _work_ upon meat and broth better than they like to work\r\nupon dry bread! No wonder that _new jails_ arise. No wonder that there are\r\nnow two or three or four or five jails to one county, and that as much is\r\nnow written upon \"_prison discipline_\" as upon almost any subject that is\r\ngoing. But, why so good, so generous, to FELONS? The truth is, that they\r\nare _not fed too well_; for, to be _starved_ is no part of their sentence;\r\nand, here are SURGEONS who have something to say! They know very well that\r\na man may be _murdered_ by keeping necessary food from him. Felons are not\r\napt to lie down and _die quietly_ for want of food. The jails are in\r\n_large towns_, where the news of any cruelty soon gets about. So that the\r\nfelons have many circumstances in their favour. It is in the villages, the\r\nrecluse villages, where the greatest cruelties are committed.\r\n\r\n64. Here, then, in this contrast between the treatment of the WORKING\r\nFELON and that of the WORKING HONEST MAN, we have a complete picture of\r\nthe present state of England; that horrible state, to which, by slow\r\ndegrees, this once happy country has been brought; and, I should now\r\nproceed to show, as I proposed in the first paragraph of this present\r\nNumber, HOW THERE CAME TO BE SO MUCH POVERTY AND MISERY IN ENGLAND; for,\r\nthis is the main thing, it being clear, that, if we do not see the real\r\ncauses of our misery, we shall be very unlikely to adopt any effectual\r\nremedy. But, before I enter on this part of my subject, let me _prove_,\r\nbeyond all possibility of doubt, that what I say relatively to the\r\nsituation of, and the allowances to, the labourers and their families, IS\r\nTRUE. The _cause_ of such situation and allowances I shall show hereafter;\r\nbut let me first show, by a reference to indubitable facts, that the\r\nsituation and allowances are such as, or worse than, I have described\r\nthem. To do this, no way seems to me to be so fair, so likely to be free\r\nfrom error, so likely to produce a suitable impression on the minds of my\r\nreaders, and so likely to lead to some useful practical result; no way\r\nseems to me so well calculated to answer these purposes, as that of taking\r\n_the very village, in which, I, at this moment, happen to be_, and to\r\ndescribe, with names and dates, the actual state of its labouring people,\r\nas far as that state is connected with steps taken under the poor-laws.\r\n\r\n65. This village was in former times a very considerable place, as is\r\nmanifest from the size of the church as well as from various other\r\ncircumstances. It is now, as a _church living_, united with an adjoining\r\nparish, called VERNON DEAN, which also has its church, at a distance of\r\nabout three miles from the church of this parish. Both parishes put\r\ntogether now contain only _eleven hundred_, and a few odd, inhabitants,\r\nmen, women, children, and all; and yet, the _great tithes_ are supposed to\r\nbe worth _two or three thousand pounds a year_, and the _small tithes_\r\nabout _six hundred pounds a year_. Formerly, before the event which is\r\ncalled \"THE REFORMATION,\" there were _two Roman Catholic priests_ living\r\nat the parsonage houses in these two parishes. They could not marry, and\r\ncould, therefore have no wives and families to keep out of the tithes;\r\nand, WITH PART OF THOSE TITHES, THEY, AS THE LAW PROVIDED, MAINTAINED THE\r\nPOOR OF THESE TWO PARISHES; and, the canons of the church commanded them\r\nto distribute the portion to the poor and the stranger, \"_with their own\r\nhands_, in _humility_ and _mercy_.\"\r\n\r\n66. This, as to church and poor, was the state of these villages, in the\r\n\"_dark ages_\" of \"_Romish superstition_.\" What! No poor-laws? No\r\npoor-rates? What horribly _unenlightened_ times! No _select vestries_?\r\nDark ages indeed! But, how stands these matters now? Why, the two parishes\r\nare moulded into _one church living_. Then the GREAT TITHES (amounting to\r\ntwo or three thousand a year) belong to some part of the _Chapter_ (as\r\nthey call it) of Salisbury. The Chapter leases them out, as they would a\r\nhouse or a farm, and they are now rented by JOHN KING, who is one of this\r\nhappy nation's greatest and oldest _pensioners_. So that, _away go_ the\r\ngreat tithes, not leaving a single wheat-ear to be spent in the parish.\r\nThe SMALL TITHES belong to a VICAR, who is one FISHER, a _nephew of the\r\nlate bishop of Salisbury_, who has not resided here for a long while; and\r\nwho has a curate, named JOHN GALE, who being the son of a little farmer\r\nand shop-keeper at BURBAGE in Wiltshire, was, by a parson of the name of\r\nBAILEY (very _well known and remembered_ in these parts), put to school;\r\nand, in the fulness of time, became a _curate_. So that, _away go_ also\r\nthe small tithes (amounting to about 500_l._ or 600_l._ a year); and, out\r\nof the large church revenues; or, rather, large church-_and-poor_\r\nrevenues, of these two parishes; out of the whole of them, there remains\r\nonly the amount of the curate, Mr. JOHN GALE'S, salary, which does not,\r\nperhaps, exceed seventy or a hundred pounds, and a part of which, at any\r\nrate, I dare say, he does not expend in these parishes: _away goes_, I\r\nsay, all the rest of the small tithes, leaving not so much as a mess of\r\nmilk or a dozen of eggs, much less a tithe-pig, to be consumed in the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\n67. As to _the poor_, the parishes continue to be _in two_; so that I am\r\nto be considered as speaking of the parish of UPHUSBAND only. You are\r\naware, that, amongst the last of the acts of the famous JUBILEE-REIGN, was\r\nan act to enable parishes to establish SELECT VESTRIES; and one of these\r\nvestries now exists in this parish. And now, let me explain to you the\r\nnature and tendency of this Jubilee-Act. Before this Act was passed,\r\n_overseers of the poor had full authority to grant relief at their\r\ndiscretion_. Pray mark that. Then again, before this Act was passed, _any\r\none justice of the peace might, on complaint of any poor person, order\r\nrelief_. Mark that. A select vestry is _to consist of the most\r\nconsiderable rate-payers_. Mark that. Then, mark these things: this\r\nJubilee-Act _forbids the overseer to grant any relief other than such as\r\nshall be ordered by the select vestry_: it forbids ONE _justice_ to order\r\nrelief, in any case, except in a case of _emergency:_ it forbids MORE\r\nTHAN ONE to order relief, except _on oath_ that the complainant has\r\n_applied to the select vestry_ (where there is one,) and has been refused\r\nrelief by it; and that, in no case, the justice's order _shall be for more\r\nthan a month_; and, moreover, that when a poor person shall appeal to\r\njustices from a select vestry, the justices, in ordering relief, or\r\nrefusing, shall have \"_regard to the conduct and_ CHARACTER _of the\r\napplicant_!\"\r\n\r\n68. From this Act, one would imagine, that _overseers_ and _justices_ were\r\nlooked upon as being too _soft_ and _yielding_ a nature; _too good, too\r\ncharitable, too liberal_ to the poor! In order that the select vestry may\r\nhave an agent suited to the purposes that the Act _manifestly has in\r\nview_, the Act authorizes the select vestry to appoint what is called an\r\n\"_assistant overseer_,\" and to _give him a salary out of the poor-rates_.\r\nSuch is this Jubilee-Act, one of the last Acts of the Jubilee-reign, that\r\nreign, which gave birth to the American war, to Pitt, to Perceval,\r\nEllenborough, Sidmouth, and Castlereagh, to a thousand millions of taxes\r\nand another thousand millions of debt: such is the Select Vestry Act; and\r\nthis now little trifling village of UPHUSBAND _has a Select-Vestry_! Aye,\r\nand an \"ASSISTANT OVERSEER,\" too, with a _salary_ of FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR,\r\nbeing, as you will presently see, about a SEVENTH PART OF THE WHOLE OF THE\r\nEXPENDITURE ON THE POOR!\r\n\r\n69. The Overseers make out and cause to be _printed_ and _published_, at\r\nthe end of every _four weeks_, an account of the disbursements. I have one\r\nof these accounts now before me; and I insert it here, word for word, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n70. \"The disbursements of Mr. T. Child and Mr. C.

Under the head of \"WIDOWS\" are, generally, old women wholly unable to\r\nwork; and that of \"OLD MEN\" are men past all labour: in some of the\r\ninstances _lodging places_, in very poor and wretched houses, are found\r\nthese old people, and, in other instances, they have the bare money; and,\r\nobserve, that money is FOR FOUR WEEKS! Gracious God! Have we had no\r\nmothers ourselves! Were we not born of woman! Shall we not feel then for\r\nthe poor widow who, in her old age, is doomed to exist on two shillings a\r\nweek, or threepence halfpenny a day, and to find herself _clothes_ and\r\nwashing and fuel and bedding out of that! And, the poor old men, the very\r\nhappiest of whom gets, you see, less than 7_d._ a day, at the end of 70 or\r\n80 years of a life, all but six of which have been years of labour! I have\r\nthought it right to put _blanks_ instead of the names, under the _second\r\nhead_. Men of less rigid morality, and less free from all illicit\r\nintercourse, than the members of the Select Vestry of Uphusband, would,\r\ninstead of the word \"_bastard_,\" have used the more amiable one of\r\n\"_love-child_;\" and, it may not be wholly improper to ask these rigid\r\nmoralists, whether they be aware, that they are guilty of LIBEL, aye, of\r\nreal criminal libel, in causing these poor girls' names to be _printed_\r\nand _published_ in this way. Let them remember, that the greater the truth\r\nthe greater the libel; and, let them remember, that the mothers and the\r\nchildren too, may have _memories_! But, it is under the head of \"FAMILIES\"\r\nthat we see that which is most worthy of our attention. Observe, that\r\n_eight shillings a week_ is _the wages_ for a day labourer in the village.\r\nAnd, you see, it is only when there are _more than four children_ that the\r\nfamily is allowed anything at all. \"LEVI COOK,\" for instance, has _five\r\nchildren_, and he receives allowance for _one_ child. \"JOSEPH WHITE\" has\r\n_eight children_, and he receives allowance for _four_. There are three\r\nwidows under this head; but, it is where there is _a man_, the father of\r\nthe family, that we ought to look with attention; and here we find, that\r\nnothing at all is allowed to a family of a man, a wife, and _four\r\nchildren_, beyond the bare eight shillings a week of wages; and this is\r\neven worse than the allowance which I contrasted with that of the hospital\r\npatients and convicted felons; for there I supposed the family to consist\r\nof a man, his wife and _three children_. If I am told, that the farmers,\r\nthat the occupiers of houses and land, are _so poor_ that they cannot do\r\nmore for their wretched work-people and neighbours; then I answer and\r\nsay, What a selfish, what a dastardly wretch is he, who is not ready to do\r\nall he can to change this disgraceful, this horrible state of things!\r\n\r\n72. But, at any rate, is the salary of the \"ASSISTANT OVERSEER\" necessary?\r\nCannot that be dispensed with? Must he have as much as _all the widows_,\r\nor _all the old men_? And his salary, together with the charge for\r\n_printing_ and other his various expenses, will come to a great deal more\r\n_than go to all the widows and old men too_! Why not, then, do without\r\nhim, and double the allowance to these poor old women, or poor old men,\r\nwho have spent their strength in raising crops in the parish? I went to\r\nsee with my own eyes some of the \"_parish houses_,\" as they are called;\r\nthat is to say, the places where the select vestry put the poor people\r\ninto to live. Never did my eyes before alight on such scenes of\r\nwretchedness! There was one place, about 18 feet long and 10 wide, in\r\nwhich I found the wife of ISAAC HOLDEN, which, when all were at home, had\r\nto contain _nineteen persons_; and into which, I solemnly declare, I would\r\nnot put 19 pigs, even if well-bedded with straw. Another place was shown\r\nme by JOB WALDRON'S daughter; another by Thomas Carey's wife. The _bare\r\nground_, and that in holes too, was the floor in both these places. The\r\nwindows broken, and the holes stuffed with rags, or covered with rotten\r\nbits of board. Great openings in the walls, parts of which were fallen\r\ndown, and the places stopped with hurdles and straw. The thatch rotten,\r\nthe chimneys leaning, the doors but bits of doors, the sleeping holes\r\nshocking both to sight and smell; and, indeed, every-thing seeming to say:\r\n\"_These_ are the abodes of wretchedness, which, to be believed possible,\r\nmust be seen and felt: _these_ are the abodes of the descendants of those\r\namongst whom _beef_, _pork_, _mutton_ and _veal_ were the food of the\r\npoorer sort; to _this are come, at last_, the descendants of those common\r\npeople of England, who, FORTESCUE tells us, were clothed throughout in\r\ngood woollens, whose bedding, and other furniture in their houses, were\r\nof wool, and that in great store, and who were well provided with all\r\nsorts of household goods, every one having all things that conduce to make\r\nlife easy and happy!\"\r\n\r\n73. I have now, my friends of Preston, amply proved, that what I have\r\nstated relative to the present state of, and allowances to, the labourers\r\nis TRUE. And now we are to do all we can to remove the evil; for, removed\r\nthe evil must be, or England must be sunk for ages; and, never will the\r\nevil be removed, until its causes, remote as well as near, be all clearly\r\nascertained. With my best wishes for the health and happiness of you all,\r\n\r\n  I remain,\r\n  Your faithful friend, and most obedient servant,\r\n  WM.

English, equal to four cents, nearly.\r\n\r\n[3] The above items may be converted into United States' money by\r\nreckoning 4s. 6d. to the dollar: Thus As 4_s._ 6_d._ : 1 dollar :: 11_l._\r\n7_s._ 2_d._ : 50 dollars 48 cents.\r\n\r\n[4] To convert these sums into United States' money, see page 16.\r\n\r\n[5] All the calculations in this work, it must be remembered, are in\r\nEnglish money but may be turned into United States' money as before\r\ndirected, page 16.\r\n\r\n[6] Be sure, now, _before you go any further_, to go to the end of the\r\nbook, and there read about MANGLE WURZLE. Be _sure_ to do this. And there\r\nread also about COBBETT'S CORN. Be sure to do this before you go any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n[7] To me the following has happened within the last year. A young man, in\r\nthe country, had agreed to be my servant; but it was found _that he could\r\nnot milk_; and the bargain was set aside. About a month afterwards a young\r\nman, who said he was _a farmer's son_, and who came from Herefordshire,\r\noffered himself to me at Kensington. \"_Can you milk?_\" He could not; but\r\n_would learn_! Ay, but in the learning, he might _dry up my cows_! What a\r\nshame to the _parents_ of these young men! Both of them were in _want of\r\nemployment_. The latter had come more than a hundred miles in _search of\r\nwork_; and here he was left to hunger still, and to be exposed to all\r\nsorts of ills, because he _could not milk_.\r\n\r\n[8] London\r\n\r\n[9] The father of the present Sir Robert Peel, who gained his fortune as a\r\ncotton weaver by the help of machinery.\r\n\r\n[10] Editors of the London Times Newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nText in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\nFootnote marker 4 is not in the original text.\r\n\r\nSome quotation marks are not matched in the original.
