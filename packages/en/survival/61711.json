NOLAN\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor, Agricultural Extension,\r\nUniversity Of Illinois\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nJAMES H. GREENE\r\n\r\nState Leader, Junior Extension Service,\r\nUniversity Of Illinois\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago New York\r\nRow, Peterson and Company\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1918\r\nRow, Peterson and Company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the status of the project system of teaching other\r\nsubjects, it is coming to be quite generally agreed that the home project\r\noffers one of the best methods for teaching elementary agriculture. The\r\nessentials of the home project plan are as follows: (1) A definite,\r\ndetailed plan for work at home covering a season or more or less extended\r\nperiod of time; (2) it must be a part of the instruction of the school\r\nin agriculture; (3) the parents and pupils should agree with the teacher\r\nupon the plan; (4) the home work must have competent supervision; (5)\r\nrecords and reports of time, method, cost and income must be honestly\r\nkept and submitted to the teacher.\r\n\r\nIn the study and practice of a vocational subject such as agriculture,\r\nwe may distinguish three aspects, each involving distinct pedagogical\r\ncharacteristics and special problems of administration. The first\r\nincludes the concrete, specific, or practical work, such as the actual\r\nmaking of a garden, the raising of poultry, or the growing of corn; the\r\nsecond involves a study of such technical sciences as botany, physics,\r\nchemistry, and the principles of the agricultural science relating\r\ndirectly to the subject of agriculture under consideration; the third\r\naspect includes such general information as the history, economic values,\r\nand other interesting facts of that particular phase of agriculture being\r\nstudied. Doctor Snedden states in his “Problems of Secondary Education,”\r\nthat the keynote of the newer education in these fields is to be found\r\nin the development of facilities for obtaining practical experience,\r\nunder conditions as nearly approximating those of the actual vocation as\r\ncan be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is for the purpose of making as practical as possible some of the\r\nprinciples of scientific agriculture for the boys and girls of the\r\npublic schools, and of giving direct vocational value to such work\r\nthat this little book, the third of a series, is submitted. The plan\r\noutlines one project in each booklet, supplying the project directions,\r\npractical exercises for laboratory work, subject-matter for study and\r\nrecitation, and notebook forms for accounts and records. The school work\r\nin elementary agriculture for one year may be based upon one or two\r\nprojects, giving opportunity to supply new subject-matter by rotation\r\neach year; or the project method may be used to supplement the text-book\r\nmethod as used either in the elementary or high-school grades. In either\r\ncase, the boys and girls doing the project work should be organized into\r\na club and affiliated with the State Boys and Girls Club movement through\r\nthe state leader, usually located at the State College of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n                                                            —THE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART ONE.

THE HOME PROJECT NOTEBOOK                    57\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE TEACHER\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers of agriculture are beginning to realize that the swine industry\r\nmay be utilized to advantage in the training of young farmers. Pig\r\nraising makes a good home project. Most boys in the country, and some\r\ngirls, will find a way to keep one or more pigs if their interest is\r\naroused. The class work may be centered around the project, or the\r\nproject may supplement and furnish the practical work in connection with\r\na text-book study of general agriculture. With one or two class-room\r\nrecitations a week based upon reports of the progress and problems of\r\nthe project, upon the practical exercises herein given, and upon the\r\nsubject-matter and project outline study presented in Part IV; including\r\nalso some Friday afternoon club programs as suggested, and with the\r\nactual work being done at home, a course in agriculture of real,\r\npractical worth may be given in any school. Pig raising enables a boy to\r\nenter in a small way into the live-stock business. Comparatively little\r\ncapital is required and quick returns are secured. With good management\r\na small beginning will soon result in a herd of good size. The teacher\r\nshould make use of the studies connected with the pig raising project\r\nto bring out the essentials of general animal production. Much that is\r\nlearned regarding the feeding and breeding of swine may be applied to\r\nraising other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the teacher be an expert in swine husbandry to\r\nmake this project a success. The teacher may help greatly by being an\r\ninterested co-worker, encouraging the boys and girls, learning with them,\r\nleading them to sources of information, and being a sympathetic friend in\r\ntheir work and life on the farm.\r\n\r\nIf possible, each member of the class should be induced to begin the pig\r\nraising project with a pure-bred gilt. If this is not possible, any pig\r\nmay be selected, fed, and cared for according to the project directions.\r\nThe home project may be carried on as an independent class activity, or\r\nit may be correlated with the work of the pig club organization. It will\r\nbe an easy matter and a most desirable thing to do to organize the class\r\ninto a pig club, affiliate with the state club movement, and all work\r\ntogether in the big business of food production.\r\n\r\n                                                            —A. W. NOLAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOOD HERD IN PASTURE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nPIG PROJECT CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n1. =Organization of the club.= See plans for club organization in the\r\nappendix. The class in elementary agriculture undertaking to base its\r\nwork largely upon the home project should organize as directed by the\r\nclub plan. Each member of the class should become a member of the club\r\nand plan to do all the work outlined for the project. The plan should\r\nmeet with the approval of the board of education, of the parents of\r\nthe boys and girls undertaking the project, and should have the hearty\r\nsupport of the county superintendent of schools, of the teacher and of\r\nthe pupils themselves who are to do the work. The state club leader at\r\nthe State College of Agriculture should be notified of the organization\r\nof the club so that he may send enrollment blanks and all such literature\r\nand publications as will be helpful in the progress of the work.\r\n\r\n2. =Getting started.= For the pig raising project members of the class\r\nor club may start with one or several pigs, or with a sow pig (or gilt)\r\nbred to farrow early in October, since this is to be a project for the\r\nentire year. A pig belonging to one of the breeds most prevalent in the\r\ncommunity should be selected, provided, of course, that it is a breed\r\nwhich is adapted to local conditions and meets market requirements.\r\n\r\nIn making the selection of the gilt, consider the pedigree and the\r\nindividuality of the animal. Unless you know the pedigree it is best\r\nto leave that to the reliable breeder with whom you are dealing. Every\r\nmember of the class joining the pig club should learn how to pick out\r\na good pig. In the beginning, however, it would be well to depend upon\r\nthe judgment of an experienced man in the selection of the gilt for the\r\nyear’s project.\r\n\r\n3. =Beginning the record.= On the blank pages provided in Part IV of\r\nthis book write a brief history and description of the breed of hog\r\nyou select. Each pupil should keep a neat and accurate record of all\r\noperations, accounts, results, etc., on the pages provided for the pig\r\nraising project.\r\n\r\n4. =Registering the pigs.= If a pure-bred gilt is the starting point of\r\nthe project, the club member should get the experience of following the\r\nrules of registration for the breed. Send to the secretary of the breed\r\nassociation for full information and blank forms, free of charge. When an\r\nanimal is sold, a certificate of registration will be appreciated by the\r\npurchaser. Fill out the registration record in the form given in Part IV\r\nof this book.\r\n\r\n5. =A place for the pig.= The first problem after securing a good pig is\r\nthat of proper care and management. Pigs need clean food, clean water,\r\nexercise and a clean bed, if they are to thrive and be profitable.\r\nSee to it that your pigs have a dry, warm, clean, and well-ventilated\r\nhouse. Sunshine is a good warmer and disinfectant of the hog house.\r\nFor the beginner the individual house of the A type or square type is\r\nrecommended. A good pasture will provide cheap, clean food, exercise and\r\na clean bed during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER\r\n\r\n1. =Feeding the young sow.= Not more than two-thirds of the grain ration\r\nof the young brood sow should be corn. Good feeders prefer to use ground\r\noats and middlings with milk or tankage[1] in connection with corn. The\r\nyoung sow should be kept in good, strong condition but not overloaded\r\nwith fat. The following ration is one good one recommended:\r\n\r\n    (a) A pasture should furnish the bulky part of the ration.\r\n\r\n    (b) A meal ration consisting of equal parts corn, ground oats\r\n    and middlings. If the pasture is a good one the sow will need\r\n    little other feed for several weeks. The meal ration should be\r\n    begun several weeks before farrowing.\r\n\r\n    (c) Roots may be fed whole or pulped and mixed with meal.\r\n\r\n    (d) Alfalfa or clover hay is good in the ration.\r\n\r\n    (e) Skim-milk is excellent for sows.\r\n\r\n    (f) For minerals keep a mixture of slack coal, two parts by\r\n    weight, air-slacked lime, one part, and salt, one part, before\r\n    the hogs all the time.\r\n\r\n2. =Farrowing time.= At farrowing time place the sow in a sheltered\r\nbuilding, dry, free from draughts and well-ventilated. To prevent the sow\r\nfrom lying against the wall of the pen and thus injuring any little pigs\r\nwhich may be lying there, it is a good plan to provide a guard rail made\r\nof two by eight-inch planks fastened with their edges against the sides\r\nof the pen a little above the bed. The young sow should have a liberal\r\namount of bedding of cut straw. She should have an individual pen or\r\nhouse, receive kind treatment and have quiet quarters. If the sow remains\r\nquiet for twelve hours or more after farrowing, so much the better.\r\n\r\n3. =Feeding and care of the nursing sow.= The feed after farrowing should\r\nbe about the same as before. At first she should have little more than\r\na drink. A thin slop of middlings and water will serve. The sow should\r\nnot be overfed and should be given a week or ten days to come to a full\r\nration. The following is one good ration recommended:\r\n\r\n    (a) Equal parts of ground oat and wheat middlings, allowed to\r\n    soak between feeds.\r\n\r\n    (b) Sweet skim-milk added to the above ration makes it almost\r\n    ideal.\r\n\r\n    (c) Corn may be used as recommended for sows before farrowing.\r\n\r\n    (d) A certain amount of bulky, succulent feed such as hay and\r\n    roots helps to keep the sow healthy.\r\n\r\n    (e) When the pigs are weaned, the feed of the sow should be cut\r\n    down to check the flow of the milk. Dry oats are recommended\r\n    for this purpose.\r\n\r\n4. =Record work.= Be sure to keep all records called for on the record\r\npages, including date of farrowing, number of pigs, method of housing,\r\nfeeding rations, successes, failures, etc. Provision for weighing the\r\npigs from time to time should be provided.\r\n\r\n5. =Reading and study.= In connection with the practical work of raising\r\nyour pigs, read at this time what your text and reference books have to\r\nsay about care and management of the brood sow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER AND DECEMBER\r\n\r\n1. =Feeding the pigs.= About the first thought in connection with raising\r\npigs is that they eat. It is important that every pig in the litter get\r\nits stomach full of the first milk of the sow. The young pigs will learn\r\nto eat when about three weeks of age. If the pigs can be fed separately\r\nfrom the sow, better results will be obtained. In one corner of the pen\r\nplace a small trough for the pigs and fence it off from the sow. At least\r\ntwice a day give the pigs as much sweet skim-milk as they will clean up.\r\nDo not leave any milk to sour in the trough. Then a few days after they\r\nbegin to nibble grass and drink milk, a gruel of oats and wheat middlings\r\nmay be made with the milk. Later a small amount of corn soaked for\r\ntwenty-four hours may be placed in the trough. Do not feed more than they\r\nwill clean up. Young pigs may be weaned at from eight to ten weeks.\r\n\r\n2. =Some standard rations for growing pigs.=\r\n\r\n    (a) Fresh skim-milk as the base for a slop of oat middlings\r\n    and wheat middlings, to which add a small amount of corn.\r\n    (Feed three times daily.) As the pigs grow older the corn and\r\n    middlings may be increased, but the corn should not be fed\r\n    alone.\r\n\r\n    (b) With corn and skim-milk or buttermilk, one part by weight\r\n    of corn to three parts of milk is satisfactory after weaning.\r\n    Gradually increase the amount of corn so that the 175-pound\r\n    pigs get about one part of corn to two parts of skim-milk or\r\n    buttermilk.\r\n\r\n    (c) With corn and tankage the following proportions are advised:\r\n\r\n       8 to 1 by weight for pigs weighing between 40 and 90 pounds\r\n      10 to 1 for weights between 90 and 125 pounds\r\n      12 to 1 for weights between 125 and 175 pounds\r\n      14 to 1 for weights between 175 and 225 pounds\r\n      16 to 1 for market hogs above 225 pounds\r\n\r\n    (d) Garbage from the kitchen is usually valuable for hogs.\r\n    The value depends largely upon the amount and kind of solid\r\n    material which it contains. Where it is thin enough to pour\r\n    readily from the bucket, but not watery, it may be fed in about\r\n    the same proportion with corn as was recommended for milk.\r\n\r\n    (e) To furnish minerals as recommended for the sow, keep the\r\n    following before the pigs at all times:\r\n\r\n      Slack coal or coal screenings  2 parts by weight\r\n      Air-slacked lime               1 part  by weight\r\n      Salt                           1 part  by weight\r\n\r\n    (f) A good pasture is always an excellent supplement to\r\n    any ration and lessens the amount of other feeds required.\r\n    Pasture-fed pigs are thriftier and make cheaper gains than\r\n    those fed in dry lots. In general feed from 3 to 5 pounds of\r\n    concentrates,[2] such as corn, other grains, meals, tankage,\r\n    etc., per 100 pounds live weight, according to age. For pigs\r\n    in a dry lot at weaning time (weighing about 40 pounds) feed\r\n    5 pounds concentrates per 100 pounds live weight, or 4 pounds\r\n    concentrates per day per 100 pounds live weight in access\r\n    to forage or pasture. No two herds of hogs feed just alike;\r\n    therefore it is the problem of the feeder to study the needs of\r\n    his hogs and try to supply them. Regularity in time of feeding,\r\n    dry, comfortable quarters, and sanitary conditions in pen and\r\n    lot are necessary to secure satisfactory gains.\r\n\r\n3. =Housing the pigs.= Perhaps the main reason for housing the pigs is to\r\nfurnish a dry bed, and since hogs do not shed their hair for warmer coats\r\nor thicken it up as horses do, provision should be made to shelter the\r\nhogs from the cold of winter as well as from the extreme heat of summer.\r\nReference has already been made to the house for the sow and her litter\r\nof pigs. It is not necessary to have expensive buildings, especially in\r\nthe beginning. Even a pen covered with boards and fresh straw may meet\r\nall the requirements.\r\n\r\nFor the pig club boys and girls starting in to raise two litters in a\r\nyear, a good, cheap and easily constructed pen is described as follows in\r\nLippincott’s “Productive Swine Husbandry”;\r\n\r\n“The pen is sixteen feet long and eight feet wide. It is seven feet high\r\nin front and three and one-half feet high at the rear. It is boarded\r\nwith cheap lumber, but all cracks are securely battened. It should be\r\npractically wind and rain proof. The opening should be a small door in\r\nthe southeast corner, as the house faces the south. Plenty of bedding\r\nshould be supplied, and the pen should be banked up outside with fresh\r\nhorse manure to a depth of about two feet in order to prevent drafts\r\nabout the floor.”\r\n\r\n4. =Records.= During the winter months do not fail to make all records\r\nand keep all accounts of operations, work, expenses, results, etc., that\r\nare called for on the record pages of this book.\r\n\r\n5. =Reference reading and study.= Read your texts, the farm papers, and\r\nany reference books available on the problems of feeding, housing, care\r\nand management of growing pigs. Consult experienced swine breeders and\r\nfeeders and learn all you can from them that will help you to succeed\r\nwith your pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY AND FEBRUARY\r\n\r\n1. =Breeding the sow for the second litter.= If an April litter of pigs\r\nis desired, the sow should be bred during the month of December or early\r\nJanuary. Breed to a pure-bred boar if possible. Keep record of dates.\r\n\r\n2. =Feeding continued.= Just as we use lumber, brick, cement, shingles,\r\nnails, etc. in the proper form and proportion in building a house, so\r\nmust we use milk, corn, oats, grass or other feeds in the building of the\r\nbody of the hog or any other animal. Each feed is made up of different\r\nfood nutrients, and each food nutrient serves a definite purpose in the\r\nbody. Some of the food nutrients are used in the animal body to make\r\nbone, others for fat, and still others for the manufacture of active\r\nmuscular tissue. Development will be incomplete if any class of food\r\nmaterial is neglected; hence the necessity of a balanced ration.\r\n\r\nFollow carefully the feeding standards and rations suggested for November\r\nand December.\r\n\r\n3. =Keeping the pigs healthy.= It is much easier to keep pigs healthy\r\nthan it is to cure sick ones. Clean, dry quarters, proper feed, plenty of\r\nsunlight and ventilation, and disinfection of houses will help to keep\r\npigs healthy.\r\n\r\nGo over your pig pen this month, and as often thereafter as is necessary,\r\nand clean out all filth from cracks and corners, floors and feeding\r\ntroughs. Apply the following disinfectant:\r\n\r\n    5 parts crude carbolic acid in\r\n  100 parts water\r\n\r\nOnce a year the pig house should be whitewashed. (See discussion in Part\r\nIII.) If possible, supply “hog wallows and dips” for your pigs. (See Part\r\nIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH AND APRIL\r\n\r\n1. =Starting the pig project at this time.= If it is desired to start\r\nthe pig project at this time instead of in September, the club may be\r\norganized, a pure-bred gilt to farrow in April purchased by each member\r\nof the club, and the work started as suggested for September and October.\r\n\r\n2. =See the September and October calendar.= In all essential points the\r\nmembers of the class beginning the pig project at this time should follow\r\nevery detail outlined for September and October.\r\n\r\n3. =The October pigs.= Continue the feeding rations of the October pigs\r\nas suggested for other months, according to weights and gains, and make\r\nlarger use of the pasture as a supplement as the spring advances.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa pasture has proven by many tests to be one of the best for\r\ngrowing pigs. After the first season for alfalfa, an acre should pasture\r\ntwo sows and their litters throughout the season. The corn rations may be\r\ncut one-half with alfalfa as a pasture. “Pigs in clover” are contented\r\nand happy. An acre of good clover should pasture one sow and her litter.\r\nA Missouri bulletin recommends feeding shoats about a pound of corn per\r\nhead per day when on good clover pasture.\r\n\r\n4. =The second litter.= If the second litter of pigs for the sow for the\r\nyear is farrowed in April, as was recommended at the beginning of this\r\nproject, quarters separate from the October pigs should be provided for\r\nthem for at least eight weeks, or until the second litter is weaned. See\r\ndirections for the care and management of the sow and pigs as given for\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n5. =Records and study.= Continue to make all records called for in the\r\nproject. Read and study texts and reference books relating to the work\r\nyou are doing each month.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY AND JUNE\r\n\r\n1. =Summer feeding and pasture.= An acre of cow peas or soy beans sown\r\nin May will furnish excellent pasture for the spring pigs, especially\r\nwhen the pods are formed about September. Rape is a good pasture crop for\r\nhogs. It may be sown from April to June and will be ready for pasture\r\nin about six weeks. Six to eight pounds of seed will suffice for an\r\nacre when sown broadcast. An acre of rape should pasture a sow and her\r\nOctober and spring litters. Corn and shorts may be used to supplement\r\nrape pasture. Continue the feeding rations according to age and weight\r\nrecommended for former months.\r\n\r\n2. =Breeding for October pigs.= During the third or fourth week of June\r\nbreed the sow for the October litter of pigs. Breed to a pure-bred sire\r\nif possible. Keep record of all dates.\r\n\r\n3. =Shelter for the pigs.= During the summer it may be necessary to\r\nprovide a shelter from the direct rays of the sun. A frame of poles\r\ncovered with straw or corn-stalks will serve this purpose.\r\n\r\n4. =Hog wallows.= Since pigs do not perspire they often suffer during\r\nthe extreme heat of the summer. They naturally seek the coolest wallow\r\neven though it be a filthy mud hole. It would be humane as well as good\r\nbusiness to provide a concrete wallow and keep it filled with eight or\r\nten inches of water. Coal-tar or crude oil added to the water will help\r\nto rid the pigs of lice.\r\n\r\n5. =Sanitary conditions.= During the summer months continue to care for\r\nthe cleanliness of all the pens and house as suggested for the winter\r\nseason. Seek the advice of successful hog raisers and veterinarians upon\r\nthe slightest evidence of unhealthy pigs. See discussion on worms and\r\ncholera in Part III.\r\n\r\n6. =Ringing the pigs.= One ring should not be placed in the center of the\r\npig’s nose, but if ringed at all, use two rings, one on either side of\r\nthe center of the nose, close to the tendons running down to the pig’s\r\nsnout.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY AND AUGUST\r\n\r\n1. =Getting ready for an exhibit.= If there is to be a local, county,\r\nor state fair, club members will arrange through their leader to have\r\nan exhibit of their pigs at the fair. Follow carefully and honestly all\r\ndirections and rules laid down by your state club leader in entering the\r\ncontest and exhibiting your pigs. If there is no fair or exhibit for you\r\nto attend, make one at your local school. Your state club leader will\r\nsend full directions for all contests and exhibits.\r\n\r\n2. =Preparing the pig for exhibition.=[3] The first thing to do toward\r\ngetting the pig ready for a show is to wash his body thoroughly with warm\r\nrain water, and a good lathery soap. Use a stiff brush so that dirt and\r\ndust will be removed. A little disinfectant in the wash water would be a\r\ngood thing. Thoroughly rinse the soap out of the hair after washing and\r\nallow the pig to dry in a clean, dry stall.\r\n\r\n=His coat.= When all the moisture has disappeared from the hair and skin,\r\na light application of sweet oil may well be made, taking particular\r\ncare to rub the oil well into the skin. The oil will keep the hair and\r\nhide soft and will give the pig a shiny coat, thereby improving his\r\nappearance. The use of too much oil is objectionable, both because it\r\nis apt to become “gummed” in the hair and make the animal “sticky”,\r\nand because it will soil the fingers of the people who will probably\r\nstroke and pet the pig when he is taken to the show. If sweet oil is not\r\navailable, raw linseed oil may be used instead, but a somewhat lighter\r\napplication of linseed oil should be made. Oil is seldom used on white\r\npigs.\r\n\r\n=The feet.= Frequently the pig’s feet will require some attention. If the\r\ntoes are too long or are broken off so that they are rough, they should\r\nbe trimmed with a good sharp jackknife. This can be done best when the\r\nanimal is lying down. If the boy has taken care of his animal properly,\r\nthe pig will submit to such handling without any objection. In fact he\r\nwill like to be played with and will enjoy having his master work with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter the pig has been properly groomed he should be kept in a dry stall\r\nthat is bedded deep with clean straw. If he shows an inclination to root\r\ndown into the dirt and soil himself by digging beneath his bedding, rings\r\nshould be placed in his nose. If not absolutely necessary, however, it is\r\nbetter not to ring hogs intended for show.\r\n\r\n=Make your pig gentle.= An hour a day should be spent teaching the pig\r\nto stand still while being examined. While it is not customary at big\r\nshows to hold pigs while they are being judged, yet at a contest of this\r\nkind the best trained pig will be looked upon with special favor, since\r\nsuch a pig will signify to the judges that his master has done everything\r\npossible “to bring him out.”\r\n\r\n3. =Marketing the pigs.= The October pigs will be ready for the market\r\nthis summer, probably as early as July. Study carefully the market\r\nclasses and grades described in Part III. Determine to which classes and\r\ngrades your pigs should belong. Watch carefully the daily market reports\r\nin the papers. Seek the best advice you can get on the important business\r\nof marketing your pigs.\r\n\r\n4. =Concluding work.= Finish all records called for in Part IV.\r\nAchievement, as one boy puts it, is “getting into the game, sticking to\r\nit, and finishing the job.” Here is your chance to achieve not only a\r\nsuccessful and profitable piece of work for yourself, but a man’s service\r\nin adding to the food supply of your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL EXERCISES\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Wild relatives of swine.= Pupils should prepare written reports upon\r\nthe following wild relatives of the hog: peccary, wart hog, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, wild boar. Consult geographies, natural histories and\r\nencyclopedias for such information.\r\n\r\n2. =Swine on the home farm.= Let each pupil report on the swine on the\r\nhome farm by filling out the following table:\r\n\r\n  Types and  Number of  Characteristics  Average  Estimated\r\n    Breeds     Each         of Each      Weight     Value\r\n  _________  _________  _______________  _______  _________\r\n  _________  _________  _______________  _______  _________\r\n  _________  _________  _______________  _______  _________\r\n\r\n3. =Market prices.= Pupils should record the market prices of hogs in a\r\ntabular form, every day for a period of two weeks. Such daily quotations\r\nmay be obtained from the newspaper. If possible, record the number of the\r\n“run” of hogs which were offered for sale at the market where prices are\r\nquoted. Note any relation that may exist between price and number of hogs.\r\n\r\n4. =Inspection trips.= The class should make a tour of the farms in the\r\ncommunity where the various breeds of swine may be studied. Note the\r\ndistinguishing characteristics. Use the following table in classifying\r\nthe distinguishing characteristics:\r\n\r\n                Position                      Other\r\n  Breed  Color  of Ears   Snout and Face  Characteristics\r\n  _____  _____  ________  ______________  _______________\r\n  _____  _____  ________  ______________  _______________\r\n  _____  _____  ________  ______________  _______________\r\n\r\n5. =Comparative judging.= Prepare a ring of swine, two, three, or four\r\nanimals, and have the pupils place these according to rank, basing their\r\njudgment on form, condition, and quality of the swine in the ring. In\r\nperforming this exercise it may be necessary for the instructor to go\r\nover the whole matter of conformation, condition, and quality as they\r\nshould be found in good swine.\r\n\r\n6. =Exercises in judging.= After the pupils have become somewhat familiar\r\nwith the points in judging swine, information may be given as to the\r\njudging of individuals by the score cards. Under the direction of the\r\ninstructor use the score card of your State Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n7. =Reports on home feeding methods.= Let each pupil report on the\r\nmethods of feeding and managing swine at home, using the following\r\noutline:\r\n\r\n(a) The house, pen, or range in which the pigs are fed for fattening.\r\n\r\n(b) The feed used, amount, kind, etc.\r\n\r\n(c) Criticism of the above methods, and suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\n8. =Houses.= Pupils should bring pictures of hog houses, clipped from\r\nfarm papers or other publications in which they may be found, and in\r\nclass make a critical study of the illustrations assembled. Ground floor\r\nplans should be drawn by each student for several types of house.\r\n\r\n9. =Breed directory.= Let each pupil make a report on the names of swine\r\nbreeders in the locality and the breeds raised. This may be made into a\r\nbreed directory for the community.\r\n\r\n10. =Making a concrete hog wallow.=[4] A hog perspires but little during\r\nhot weather and is forced to seek a cool mud wallow if nothing else is\r\nprovided. This has resulted in the impression that the hog is a dirty\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nA concrete hog wallow provided with a drain will enable the hog raiser\r\nto give his hogs a cool, clean refuge from the heat. If a small amount\r\nof crude oil is poured on the surface of the water, it will serve to rid\r\nthe animals of lice and keep the skin in good condition. If possible, the\r\nwallow should be located near the water supply, either a tank or spring.\r\nThe following sectional view of a wallow is taken from the Cement News\r\npublished by the Universal Portland Cement Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. SECTIONAL VIEW OF A CONCRETE WALLOW]\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the pool be made rectangular with rounded corners.\r\nIt should not have a depth of more than 18 inches. The size should be\r\ndetermined by the number of pigs kept. A concrete floor 4 feet wide laid\r\naround the pool will prevent rooting and the carrying of mud into the\r\nwallow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. TROUGH FOR YOUNG PIGS]\r\n\r\n11. =Wooden troughs for swine.= In figures 2 and 3 are shown two types of\r\nwooden troughs that are used extensively by swine raisers. The one shown\r\nin figure 2 is designed for use in feeding young pigs. As shown in the\r\ndrawing it is shallow and is constructed with a flat bottom and wide end\r\npieces. The shallowness makes it easy for the young pigs to get at the\r\nfeed, and the wide ends make it difficult for the pigs to overturn it.\r\nThe cross pieces prevent the hogs from lying in the trough. The drawing\r\ngives all necessary dimensions. Make out a bill of material and a bill of\r\nstock, cut the pieces, and assemble them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. TROUGH FOR MATURE HOGS]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 shows a V-shaped trough for older hogs. Like the one shown for\r\nyoung pigs, it is wide at the ends and is provided with cross pieces. The\r\ndrawing gives all necessary dimensions. Make out bills of material and\r\nstock, and construct.\r\n\r\n12. =Hurdles for use in stock judging.= A hurdle as described in this\r\nexercise is a panel of boards made as shown in figure 4. Hurdles are\r\nportable and are useful when sorting hogs into groups or when scoring and\r\njudging them. Three or four hurdles fastened together at the ends make a\r\nvery good temporary pen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. HURDLE]\r\n\r\nThe materials required are four pieces 1 by 4 inches by 12 feet, one\r\npiece 2 by 4 inches by 8 feet, and 2 pounds of eightpenny common nails.\r\nTo build the panel, cut the pieces as shown in the drawing. Lay the four\r\npieces of 2 by 4 inches on the floor, spacing them 4 feet apart, nail the\r\nbottom board, space 2 inches and nail the second board, space 3 inches\r\nand nail the third board, and nail the fourth board on the top.\r\n\r\n13. =Making a collection of feeds.= Secure a supply of small bottles and\r\nmake and label a collection of samples of feeds suitable for pigs.\r\n\r\n14. =Weighing pigs with steelyards.=[5] In the pig project it is\r\nrecommended that the pig or pigs be weighed each week. Where stock\r\nor platform scales are at hand the weighing can be performed easily,\r\nbut, unfortunately, some boys do not have scales of any kind which\r\nthey can use for this purpose. In project work boys do not generally\r\nfeel that they can afford to purchase platform scales, but since the\r\nweighing is a very important part of the work, some means should be\r\nprovided, and steelyards are suggested for the purpose. These are not\r\nexpensive, costing about $3.00, and with proper arrangement can be used\r\nvery satisfactorily. For weighing feed they can usually be suspended\r\nfrom joists in granaries, but for weighing the pig it will probably be\r\nnecessary to construct a horse from which to suspend them. A crate also\r\nwill be needed for holding the pig while being weighed. The material\r\nrequired for these articles is not expensive and both can be constructed\r\nby the boys in the club or class.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING HORSE AND CRATE[6]\r\n\r\n=Material.= Any ordinary lumber having proper dimensions can be\r\nused. If new lumber is purchased, yellow pine will serve the purpose\r\nsatisfactorily, costing 2½c or 3c per lumber foot. The length suggested\r\nfor the horse is 8 feet, though this can be reduced by placing the\r\nsteelyards at right angles to the length of the horse in place of in the\r\nsame direction, as suggested by the cut. The height should be 7 feet to\r\nprovide space for fastening the crate to the steelyards. The legs should\r\nbe beveled at upper ends before nailing to rail and should be spread at\r\nbottom so as to measure 3½ feet. Stock required for constructing horse\r\nis as follows: One piece 2″×6″×8′ if made eight feet long; two pieces\r\n2″×6″×14′; or 2″×4″×14′ for legs; two pieces 1″×6″×10′ for braces.\r\n\r\nIn place of the crate any box of the proper size can be used for the\r\npurpose by nailing strips on the sides for convenience in handling,\r\nand for fastening rope to it. If a crate is constructed it should be 4\r\nor 4½ feet long, 2½ feet high, and 20 inches wide. The slats on one end\r\nof the crate should be securely nailed, and on the other they should be\r\narranged to slide into place, so that they can be removed easily after\r\neach weighing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. ARRANGEMENT FOR WEIGHING PIGS]\r\n\r\nThe pig to be weighed is securely fastened in the crate and the horse\r\nplaced over it so that the ring or hook of steelyards is nearly over\r\nthe center. The crate is then raised sufficiently to place 2×4 blocks\r\nunder it, and it is then fastened to the steelyards by means of a chain\r\nor rope. The scale weight on the steelyards can be approximately placed\r\nbefore the blocks are removed from under the crate. To remove blocks,\r\ndraw down on long end of steelyards, which will raise the crate from the\r\nblocks and allow them to be easily removed. After the crate swings free\r\nthe scale weight can be carefully adjusted to ascertain exactly the gross\r\nweight of the pig and crate. The weight of pig can, of course, be easily\r\nascertained by subtracting the weight of crate from the gross weight.\r\n\r\nThere are advantages in this arrangement for weighing, in addition to\r\nits being inexpensive. The parts can easily be moved from place to\r\nplace without injury, and can be placed in any pen or hog lot without\r\ndifficulty, which is not always the case with platform or other scales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nSWINE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The ancestors of the hogs found on American farms came from two\r\nsources, southeastern Asia and western Europe. These two families of hogs\r\nare often designated by the names _Sus Indica_ and _Sus Scrofa_. Although\r\nthe word _sus_ is Latin, boys or girls who feed pigs use it when they\r\ncall “sui, sui,” to the pigs at feeding time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. A RAZOR-BACK]\r\n\r\n_Sus Indica_, a native of China, was a small, fine-boned animal much\r\nprized by the people of southeastern Asia. Descendants of _Sus Scrofa_,\r\nthe wild boar of western Europe, are still hunted in forests and private\r\ngame preserves. The wild boar is a large, ferocious animal with thin hams\r\nand a heavy shield. From its Chinese ancestor the modern hog has derived\r\nits form and quality; from the wild boar it has obtained its size and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nSwine were probably introduced into this country by early Spanish\r\nexplorers. For many years wild hogs were found in the everglades of\r\nFlorida. It is recorded that Jamestown had to be fenced to keep out\r\nthe wild hogs, descendants of those brought over by earlier settlers.\r\nAlthough the ancestors of the hog came from China and western Europe, it\r\nremained for English breeders to blend the two and develop the earlier\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\nThe earlier breeds like the Berkshire were developed where corn is not\r\ngrown successfully. Under such conditions the bacon-type of hog was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n=Bacon-type.= The bacon hog has a longer side, less fat and a smaller\r\nham. Canada, Denmark, and Ireland produce the finest hogs of this\r\ntype. Bacon hogs furnish the “Wiltshire side,” in which ham, side, and\r\nshoulder are marketed in one piece. This cut commands a higher price\r\non the European continent than pork from the lard hog. The weight of\r\nthis type of hog for market varies from 160 to 200 pounds. The form of\r\nthe bacon-type is quite different from the form of the lard-type. The\r\nhog has longer legs, the body is not so thick or deep, the shoulders,\r\nneck, and jowls are lighter. The hog should be longer from shoulder to\r\nham, with sufficient depth and thickness to denote good constitution.\r\nQuality, as in the lard-type, is indicated by a smooth coat of hair and\r\nan unwrinkled skin. The finished bacon hog “handles” firmer to the touch\r\nthan a finished lard hog. The bones of this type are larger, but they\r\nshould present a clean-cut appearance. The loin is the most valuable cut\r\nin this hog, and should be as wide as the rest of the back, full, strong,\r\nand well packed with flesh. The ribs should spring out boldly from the\r\nbackbone and turn sharply downward, giving a straight, flat side. The\r\nleading breeds of the bacon-type of swine are the Tamworth and the Large\r\nYorkshire. Sometimes the Hampshire is so classed.\r\n\r\n=Lard-type.= The lard hog is a native of the corn belt. This type of\r\nhog has a compact, thick, deep, smooth body. The ham, back, loin and\r\nshoulders are the most valuable parts and are developed to a higher\r\ndegree. The production of lard and fat is the principle aim of this\r\ntype. Quality is denoted by fine hair, smooth, clean, unwrinkled skin,\r\nrather fine bone, and an even distribution of flesh. The jowls should\r\nbe broad, plump, and full, and the belly not baggy in appearance. The\r\nhog should have short upright pasterns. The snout should be fine, the\r\nface wide between the eyes, and the space between the ears wide and\r\nfull. Width between the eyes and fullness and width between the ears\r\nindicate a good feeder. The neck should be short and deep and should\r\nblend smoothly into the shoulder. The shoulder should be well developed,\r\nblending smoothly into the body and covered evenly with flesh over all\r\nparts. The back should be broad, slightly arched, of medium length and\r\nthickly fleshed. The ribs should be well sprung, the sides deep and even\r\nbetween the shoulders and ham. The ham should be broad, deep, plump,\r\nand heavily fleshed well down toward the hocks. The rump should be as\r\nwide as the back. The legs should be short, straight, set well apart and\r\nsquarely under the body. The above brief description is general for all\r\nbreeds of the lard hog. The Poland China, Chester White, Berkshire, and\r\nDuroc-Jersey are the popular breeds of this type of hog.\r\n\r\n=Breeds.= The selection of a good breed by a pig club member is an\r\nimportant matter. He should be influenced by two conditions: the breeds\r\nraised in the community and his own preference. The community which\r\nconfines its efforts to two, or better, to one breed of hog, will attract\r\nbuyers and its stock will command fancy prices. On the other hand, a\r\nbreeder will be most successful with the breed in which he has confidence.\r\n\r\nTo make an intelligent choice, every club member should become familiar\r\nwith the characteristics, advantages, and shortcomings of the several\r\nbreeds of hogs. It should be borne in mind that there is no “best breed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBACON BREEDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. LARGE YORKSHIRE]\r\n\r\n=The Large Yorkshire.= This large white breed, too, originated in\r\nEngland. White spots are not desirable and black hairs disqualify\r\nanimals. The Large Yorkshire possesses the typical bacon conformation:\r\nlight hams and shoulders, long legs and a long, narrow and deep body. On\r\naccount of its size, strong bone, and ability to produce large litters,\r\nYorkshire boars have been used for crossing with breeds which are lacking\r\nin these respects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. TAMWORTH]\r\n\r\n=The Tamworth.= This breed much resembles the Large Yorkshire in size\r\nbut has a longer snout. The Tamworths are good rustlers and produce bacon\r\nwhich can be used for export purposes at a comparatively early age. They\r\nare sometimes criticized for their inability to compete with the lard\r\nbreeds in the production of fat carcasses. It should be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that they are distinctly a bacon breed.\r\n\r\nThe Large Yorkshire and the Tamworth are the only two bacon breeds in\r\nthis country. Other minor breeds, both lard and bacon, which might be\r\nmentioned are the Mule-Foot, Small Yorkshire, Essex, Cheshire, Victoria\r\nand Large Black.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARD BREEDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. POLAND CHINA]\r\n\r\n=Poland China.= The Poland China is one of the most popular breeds. It\r\nis of medium size, black in color with “six white points” on face, tail\r\nand feet. Its ears are not erect as are those of the Berkshire, but\r\nbreak and fall forward about two-thirds of the length from the head.\r\nThe face is not dished as much as that of the Berkshire, another mark of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nLike all of the rest of the lard breeds, it should have heavy shoulders\r\nand hind quarters, and deep, short sides. For a time there was a demand\r\nupon the part of breeders for small, fine-boned animals. The demand of\r\nthe packers was too strong, however, and the development of the Big Type\r\nPoland China marked the downfall of this “fad.”\r\n\r\nThis breed is noted for its constitution and vigor. Much of this is due,\r\nno doubt, to the fact that the originators of the breed in the Miami\r\nValley wished to develop a hog which could be driven to Cincinnati, the\r\ngreat packing center of that period. The small type Poland China had\r\nsmall litters. This fault has been remedied in the big type strains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. BERKSHIRE]\r\n\r\n=The Berkshire.= The erect ears, dished face and short snout of the\r\nBerkshire distinguish it quite sharply from the Poland China. It is one\r\nof the oldest breeds of swine, originating in Berkshire, a county of\r\nEngland. The early Berkshire was a bacon, not a lard hog. It was large,\r\nrough, and late maturing. Numerous crosses with Chinese and Neopolitan\r\npigs of fine quality have been instrumental in producing the modern,\r\nmedium sized, compact animal.\r\n\r\nThis breed has a broad back, a good spring of rib and thick rump and\r\nhams. Berkshires are early maturing and breeders claim that the meat is\r\nsecond in quality to none. Like the Poland China, it has white on the\r\nfeet, face and tip of tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. DUROC-JERSEY]\r\n\r\n=Duroc-Jersey.= This breed of red hog is becoming very popular on account\r\nof its constitution and ability to produce large litters. It resembles\r\nthe Poland China in size, shape and position of ear and snout. The color\r\ndesired by most breeders is a cherry and not a sandy red.\r\n\r\nNothing definite is known of its early history. Red hogs had often been\r\nimported. Among the records of such importations are those of Henry Clay\r\nfrom Spain and Daniel Webster from Portugal. Early Berkshires of red\r\ncolor were thought to have been used in developing the breed.\r\n\r\nTwo breeds, a Jersey Red in New Jersey and a Duroc in New York State,\r\ncame into prominence. The former was a coarse hog of good length of body\r\nand strong constitution. The union of these two breeds produced the\r\nDuroc-Jersey.\r\n\r\nAnother point which especially recommends this breed in addition to those\r\nalready mentioned is its grazing ability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. CHESTER WHITE]\r\n\r\n=The Chester White.= This breed of white hog resembles the Poland China.\r\nThe ears are more drooping, however, than those of that breed and break\r\nforward about one-third the distance from the head. The Chester White is\r\nalso wider, thicker and longer in body.\r\n\r\nThe breed originated in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Two other strains,\r\nTodd’s Improved Chester White and the Ohio Improved Chester White, have\r\nresulted from breed improvement. The latter has now developed its own\r\nbreed association.\r\n\r\nThe Chester White ranks second to Duroc-Jerseys in the size of its\r\nlitters, but the fact that its white color makes it subject to sunburn\r\nprevents its development in the southern and middle western states.\r\n\r\n=The Hampshire.= This breed is classed as between the fat and\r\nbacon-types. This is due to a lighter shoulder and ham and a longer side\r\nwith less depth than those of the breeds previously described. Although\r\nit will not meet the demands of the “Wiltshire side” for the English\r\nmarket, it will provide bacon which meets the demands of the American\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. HAMPSHIRE]\r\n\r\nThe Hampshire is a black hog with a belt of white from 4 to 12 inches\r\nin width encircling the body and including the forelegs. It is more\r\nupstanding than the lard-type breeds, and has a broad and fairly deep\r\nbody. A narrow head with close set ears extending forward but not\r\nbreaking are other marks of distinction. The Hampshire matures early, has\r\ngood sized litters, and is a good grazer. The proportion of fat to lean\r\nmeat is very desirable. Little is known of its early history other than\r\nthat it originated in Hampshire, England, and that representatives were\r\nbrought to Kentucky at an early date.\r\n\r\n=Selecting the pigs.= In choosing a breed a club member will do well to\r\nselect the one which is most prevalent in his community, provided, of\r\ncourse, that it is a breed which meets the market requirements and in\r\nother ways is adapted to local conditions. This will be the case if he\r\nlives in a community of successful swine breeders.\r\n\r\n=Getting started.= After a breed has been decided upon, the next thing is\r\nto pick out the individuals. A pig club member may start with a pig or\r\npigs after weaning, or a bred gilt may be purchased.\r\n\r\nWherever possible a pure-bred sow pig or gilt should be secured. Two\r\nthings are to be considered, the pedigree and individuality of the\r\nanimal. Unless you are familiar with pedigrees, it is best to leave that\r\nto the reliable breeder with whom you are dealing. Every pig club member,\r\nhowever, should be able to pick out a good pig.\r\n\r\nFour things should be considered in selecting a breeding animal: form,\r\nquality, constitution, sex character and type. It is true that the matter\r\nis more difficult with a young pig than with an older pig, but part or\r\nall of these conditions may be noted in the young pig.\r\n\r\nA pig with a comparatively long body and with good depth and width should\r\nbe selected. It should stand squarely on short legs of good bone. There\r\nshould be no wrinkles on the body.\r\n\r\nA good heart girth indicates plenty of room for the lungs and denotes\r\na strong constitution. Quality is shown in fineness of bone and hair.\r\nToo fine a bone should be avoided. To judge type one must be familiar\r\nwith the requirements of the various breeds. Above all, the pig selected\r\nshould be a good feeder.\r\n\r\n=Care and management.= After the pig or pigs are secured, the next\r\nproblem is one of care and management. Every pig club member should keep\r\nin mind that pigs require a variety of clean food, clean water, exercise\r\nand, a clean bed if they are to thrive and be profitable. Being a large\r\nfeeder the pig will eat dirty food from a dirty trough if no other is\r\noffered. On this account it is often thought that he will get along under\r\nany sort of circumstances. Such is not the case. No animal will respond\r\nmore quickly to careful, intelligent treatment than the pig.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. A GOOD HOG HOUSE]\r\n\r\n=Houses.= Hogs must be housed in dry, warm, clean, and well-ventilated\r\nhouses. Sunshine is a very important agent in disinfecting and warming\r\nthe hog house. The well-established breeder may have a colony house, but\r\nfor the beginner the individual house of the A or square type is to be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer a good pasture will provide cheap, clean feed,\r\nexercise and a clean bed. It may be necessary, however, to provide a\r\nshelter from the direct rays of the sun. This may be furnished by a frame\r\nof poles covered with straw or corn stalks.\r\n\r\n=Sanitation.= It is much easier to keep a pig healthy than it is to cure\r\nhim after he becomes sick. Cleanliness, proper feed, disinfection of\r\nhouses and animals, together with plenty of sunlight, ventilation and\r\ndryness of quarters, will help to keep a pig in good health.\r\n\r\nIf care is taken that there are no unnecessary cracks or corners in which\r\nfilth may accumulate, it will be easy to keep houses, troughs and feeding\r\nfloors sanitary. A good disinfectant should be used regularly in the\r\npens. Five parts of crude carbolic acid in one hundred parts of water\r\nis recommended. All filth should be removed before the disinfectant is\r\napplied. Once a year all buildings should be whitewashed. A pint of crude\r\ncarbolic acid should be added to each three gallons of whitewash.\r\n\r\nFeed lots and pastures cannot be disinfected in this fashion, but\r\napplications of lime and an occasional plowing will help.\r\n\r\n=Hog wallows and dips.= The pig is not naturally a filthy animal, and if\r\ngiven an opportunity will keep fairly clean. During the extreme heat of\r\nsummer the pig suffers, owing to the fact that he perspires but little.\r\nHe seeks the shelter of a cool mud wallow to get relief from heat and\r\nparasites. The intelligent hog raiser will provide a concrete wallow and\r\nkeep it filled with eight or ten inches of water. Coal-tar or crude oil\r\nadded to the water helps to rid the animal of lice. Where the animals are\r\nbadly infested with lice it will be necessary to wet them all over, as\r\nthe lice are found behind the ears, inside of the legs and in the folds\r\nof the skin. A two per cent solution of creolin may be used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n=Worms.= Pigs are often affected with worms which interfere with their\r\nthriftiness. A tablespoonful of castor oil and forty drops of oil of\r\nAmerican wormseed should be given in the slop to wormy pigs. Six grains\r\nof santonin and four grains of calomel per 100 pound pig is also used\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n=Hog cholera.= It is not possible within the scope of a small book to\r\ndescribe all of the diseases that attack pigs. Every pig club member,\r\nhowever, should know something about hog cholera, the greatest scourge\r\nwhich attacks swine.\r\n\r\nThe germs of hog cholera may be carried on the boots of visitors, by\r\npigeons or dogs. It can only be combatted by vaccination of healthy hogs,\r\nquarantining of all sick hogs, burning of all dead hogs and disinfection\r\nof premises.\r\n\r\nThree methods of vaccination are in use:\r\n\r\n(1) The injection of an anti-cholera serum, which makes the hog immune\r\nonly a few months or weeks.\r\n\r\n(2) The simultaneous treatment whereby the serum used in (1) and the\r\ndefibrinated blood or virus from a diseased hog are injected together.\r\nThis treatment renders the hog immune for life.\r\n\r\n(3) In the combination method, serum alone is used first, and ten days\r\nlater the simultaneous treatment is administered. This method is seldom\r\nused. The services of a skilled veterinarian should be secured to\r\nvaccinate hogs.\r\n\r\n=Feeds and feeding.= Protein, fats, and carbohydrates are the three\r\nclasses of nutrients found in feeds. These, in addition to mineral\r\nmatter and water, furnish material for the maintenance and growth of\r\nthe pig. Proteins furnish the material for the production of muscle.\r\nFats and carbohydrates provide fuel for heating the body and giving\r\nactivity to the muscles. An excess of food nutrients, especially fats and\r\ncarbohydrates, is stored in the body as fat. The mineral matter goes into\r\nthe production of bone.\r\n\r\nAll feeds do not contain these nutrients in the same proportions. Some\r\nfeeds, like corn, are deficient in protein, while others, like tankage,\r\ncontain a large percentage of protein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. A SELF-FEEDER]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is easily seen that the problem of the hog\r\nraiser is to use a combination of feeds which will provide the proper\r\nproportions of the various nutrients. While the pigs are young, bone and\r\nmuscle producing foods are especially necessary. Toward maturity the\r\npercentage of fat producing foods may be increased.\r\n\r\n=Corn, pasture and other supplements.= Corn is the most widely used feed\r\nfor pigs. As has been stated, it is essentially a fat producing food\r\nand must be properly supplemented. Clover or alfalfa pasture supplies\r\nthe protein and part of the mineral matter which the corn lacks. Rape\r\nfurnishes good pasture for hogs, almost equal to clover and alfalfa. Rye,\r\nblue grass, cow peas and soy beans together with various pasture mixtures\r\nhave value as hog pastures. Where pigs are fed in a dry lot, tankage\r\nmay be used to supply the protein. Pasture-fed pigs are thriftier and\r\nmake cheaper gains than those fed in a dry lot. Skim-milk or buttermilk\r\ntogether with tankage makes an ideal supplement to corn. Middlings and\r\nshorts may also be used.\r\n\r\n=Mineral matter.= To insure pigs getting enough mineral matter it is\r\nrecommended that the following mixture be kept before them at all\r\ntimes:[7]\r\n\r\n  Wood ashes or coal screenings   1 bushel\r\n  Air-slaked lime                 8 quarts\r\n  Salt                            8 quarts\r\n  Rock phosphate                  3 quarts\r\n  Copperas (iron sulphate)        1 quart\r\n\r\nThe first four ingredients should be mixed thoroughly and the copperas\r\ndissolved in warm water and poured over the mixture.\r\n\r\n=Feeding and care of the sow.= In starting in the swine industry with one\r\nor more gilts, it should be borne in mind that a sow should not be bred\r\nuntil she is eight or ten months of age. Every hog raiser should aim to\r\nhave his sows produce two litters a year, farrowing in April and October.\r\n\r\nNot more than two-thirds of the grain ration should be corn. Some feeders\r\nprefer to use ground oats and middlings exclusively. In any event,\r\nheating and fattening foods should be avoided. In addition to the grain\r\nration, roots and clover or alfalfa hay or skim-milk should be fed. Sows\r\non good pasture require little grain except just before farrowing.\r\n\r\nAt farrowing time the sow should be placed in a building, dry, free from\r\ndraughts, and well-ventilated.\r\n\r\nThe feed after farrowing should be about the same as before. After the\r\nfirst week larger quantities are necessary for the sow in order to\r\nmaintain the pigs properly. When the pigs are weaned, the feed of the sow\r\nshould be cut down to check the flow of milk. Oats is recommended for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\n=Feeding the pigs.= The young pigs will learn to eat at about three weeks\r\nof age. At this time if the pigs can be fed separately from the sow\r\nbetter results will be obtained. Skim-milk, middlings and soaked corn are\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nYoung pigs should be given opportunity for exercise but should be\r\nsheltered from cold winds or hot sun. Young pigs may be weaned at from 8\r\nto 10 weeks. Avoid too heavy feeding at first.\r\n\r\nPasture-fed pigs may be given one-fourth of a pound of tankage, or one\r\nand one-half to two pounds of skim-milk or buttermilk per day; one-half\r\npound of middlings may be added to the above ration. Adding bran or\r\nfinely ground oats to the middlings will prevent constipation in case the\r\nmiddlings are too fine and floury.\r\n\r\nWhat corn is readily cleaned up may be fed at the age of three months or\r\na little earlier if skim-milk is being fed. The pigs should be fed four\r\ntimes a day at first and then three times. As the pigs grow older the\r\ncorn and middlings may be increased, but at no time should corn alone be\r\nfed.\r\n\r\n=Markets.= The successful stock man is the one who is familiar with\r\nmarket requirements and tries to meet them. Every pig club member\r\nshould know something of the market classes and grades of hogs. These\r\ndiffer somewhat according to local conditions, but in a general way the\r\nclassification used on the Chicago market may be taken as a standard.\r\n\r\nHeavy hogs are no longer at a premium except when the price of lard is\r\nhigh. They contain a large amount of fat. The various grades of hogs in\r\nthe several classes indicate the degree to which they have attained to\r\nthe standard of perfection, prime being the highest grade, and common and\r\ninferior the lowest grades.\r\n\r\nButcher hogs are commonly used for fresh meat trade. They are principally\r\nbarrows.\r\n\r\nThe term packing refers to the use to which this class of hogs is\r\ncommonly put. They are inferior to butcher hogs and are cut up, cured,\r\nand packed in boxes and barrels. Mixed packing hogs are those marketed\r\nwithout grading. Speculators often buy them up and grade them.\r\n\r\nThe meat of pigs is unsuitable for curing and supplies part of the demand\r\nfor cheap, fresh meat.\r\n\r\nBacon hogs quoted on the Chicago market are not the bacon hogs which\r\nfurnish the Wiltshire sides. They are lard hogs that are not highly\r\nfinished, have a high per cent of lean meat, and supply the demand for\r\nlean pork.\r\n\r\nStags are males castrated too late in life to grade as barrows. Boars are\r\nused for sausage and supply cheap fresh meat.\r\n\r\nThe present demand is for hogs weighing from 200 to 250 pounds, and\r\nthe hog raiser should aim to finish and market his hogs at about these\r\nweights.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET CLASSES AND GRADES\r\n\r\n  ===========+=======+======================+===========\r\n      Class  | Weight|     Sub-Class        |   Grade\r\n  -----------+-------+----------------------+-----------\r\n  Prime heavy|350-500|                      |   Prime\r\n             |       |{ Heavy        280-350|{  Prime\r\n             |       |{                     |{  Good\r\n             |       |{                     | { Prime\r\n  Butcher    |180-350|{ Medium       220-280| { Good\r\n             |       |{                     | { Common\r\n             |       |{                     |{  Prime\r\n             |       |{ Light        180-220|{  Good\r\n             |       |                      |{  Common\r\n             |       |                      | { Good\r\n             |       |{ Heavy        300-500| { Common\r\n             |       |{                     | { Inferior\r\n             |       |{                     |{  Good\r\n  Packing    |200-500|{ Medium       250-300|{  Common\r\n             |       |{                     |{  Inferior\r\n             |       |{                     | { Good\r\n             |       |{ Mixed        200-280| { Common\r\n             |       |                      | { Inferior\r\n             |       |                      |{  Choice\r\n             |       |      {English 160-220|{  Light\r\n             |       |      {               |{  Fat\r\n             |       |{Bacon{               | { Choice\r\n             |       |{     { U.

This constitution may be amended by a vote of ____\r\n\r\n    (Two-thirds)\r\n\r\nof the members present at any regular meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n_a._ Always address the president as Mr. or Miss President.\r\n\r\n_b._ All remarks should be addressed to the president.\r\n\r\n_c._ There should be no talking between members.\r\n\r\n_d._ The president should recognize the person who seeks the floor by\r\nsaying: “Mr. or Miss ____.”\r\n\r\n_e._ This indicates that the person thus recognized has the privilege of\r\nspeaking (of the floor) and must not be interrupted.\r\n\r\n_f._ The only interruptions allowable are (1) a call for a point of\r\norder, or (2) a question.\r\n\r\n_g._ A point of order applies to a member who has made a motion which is\r\nout of order because of another motion before the meeting, or to a member\r\nwhose remarks are not on the subject under consideration, or to a person\r\nwho is exceeding the time limit for discussion, etc. A point of order is\r\nexecuted as follows:\r\n\r\nMember rising while another is speaking: “Mr. President, I rise to a\r\npoint of order.”\r\n\r\nThe president will then recognize the speaker as follows: “Mr. ____,\r\nplease state your point of order.”\r\n\r\nMember who has interrupted speaker: “Mr. President, the speaker, Mr. ____\r\n\r\n    (Interrupted member’s name)\r\n\r\nis out of order because his remarks are not on the subject under\r\nconsideration (or is out of order because there is another motion before\r\nthe meeting).”\r\n\r\nPresident: “The chair decides that the point is (or is not) well taken.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the interrupted speaker takes his seat or makes an appeal from\r\nthe decision of the chair as follows:\r\n\r\nInterrupted speaker: “Mr. President, I appeal from the decision of the\r\nChair.”\r\n\r\nPresident: “Mr. ____ appeals from the decision of the chair. As many as\r\nare in favor of sustaining the decision of the chair will make manifest\r\nby saying ‘Aye;’ contrary-minded, ‘No.’”\r\n\r\nThe motion is (or is not) carried.\r\n\r\nIf the motion is carried, and the decision of the chair is thus\r\nsustained, the interrupted speaker has no further recourse and must take\r\nhis seat. If, however, the motion is lost and the decision of the chair\r\nis not sustained, the speaker may continue to speak.\r\n\r\nQuestion. The speaker may be interrupted by any member for the purpose\r\nof asking a question. This question may be one of personal privilege or\r\nmay be for the purpose of gaining information about the subject under\r\ndiscussion. The execution of this motion may proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nMember taking floor while another member is speaking: “Mr. President, I\r\nrise to a question of information.”\r\n\r\nPresiding officer: “State your question.”\r\n\r\nMember: “Do I understand the speaker to mean that ____ etc.?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker then proceeds to give the information desired, and the\r\nmeeting proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn case of a question of personal privilege the process is as follows:\r\n\r\nMember, rising and interrupting speaker: “Mr. President, I rise to a\r\nquestion of personal privilege.”\r\n\r\nPresiding officer: “State your question.”\r\n\r\nMember: “Mr. President, this room is too warm for comfort, and I\r\ntherefore ask to have the windows opened.”\r\n\r\nIn either case the presiding officer may rule for or against the person\r\nasking the question.\r\n\r\n_h._ Never offer a motion by saying, “I move you—,” but simply with “I\r\nmove, etc.”\r\n\r\n_i._ Never offer a motion while another motion is still before the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n_j._ Before any matter is voted upon the presiding officer must state the\r\nmotion fully and completely.\r\n\r\n_k._ The ordinary form of voting upon regular motions is as follows:\r\nPresiding officer: “All in favor of this motion say ‘Aye’ (a short pause\r\nfor the vote); contrary, ‘No.’” The presiding officer then announces the\r\nresult by saying: “The motion is carried,” or “The motion is lost.”\r\n\r\n_l._ Motions for question of privilege or point of order take precedence\r\nover all other motions.\r\n\r\n_m._ Never attempt to place too many amendments to a motion. (Two are\r\nallowable; that is, an amendment to an amendment.) It is usually much\r\nbetter to offer a substitute motion.\r\n\r\n_n._ A motion may not be put to a vote of the meeting until it has been\r\nseconded or supported by some member other than the one making the motion.\r\n\r\n_o._ In case of tie votes the president or presiding officer decides the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n_p._ A motion to adjourn the meeting is in order at any time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these simple rules which may serve for the beginning of\r\nthe club’s activities, each club library should contain a modern work on\r\nparliamentary practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE OFFICERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President\r\n\r\n1. Calls the meetings to order.\r\n\r\n2. Announces the order of business.\r\n\r\n3. Puts all questions and motions.\r\n\r\n4. Decides points of order.\r\n\r\n5. Decides the votes.\r\n\r\n6. Calls another member to the chair if he or she wishes to take part in\r\nthe debate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President\r\n\r\n1. Performs all the duties of the president in case he or she is absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary\r\n\r\n1. Keeps the minutes of all meetings.\r\n\r\n2. Handles all correspondence.\r\n\r\n3. Sends or posts notices for meetings.\r\n\r\n4. Reads the minutes of the previous meetings.\r\n\r\n5.

Keeps an account of all moneys collected and paid out.\r\n\r\n3. Pays bills when ordered by the president or secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL CLUBS\r\n\r\nThe programs for club meetings will depend largely on the type of\r\nproject, the time to be devoted to meetings, and the originality of the\r\nleader. There should be something for everyone to do; each individual\r\nshould have some share in each club meeting.\r\n\r\nThe general program might divide itself into: (1) project; (2) business,\r\nliterary, and demonstration; (3) social. No one of these three divisions\r\ncan be carried on exclusive of the others. The projects will have\r\ntheir stories, the literary programs will sometimes include project\r\ndemonstrations, while the social spirit should always be present.\r\n\r\nIt would be well to combine as much of a “do” program as possible with\r\nthe literary work. Demonstrations, “stunts,” and contests always add\r\ninterest. Do not forget that music is always a welcome addition to a club\r\nprogram. The following suggestions are given merely to assist the club\r\nin arranging for the year’s work. Further suggestions may be obtained\r\nby studying the programs of projects other than yours. Meetings should\r\nbe held at least once a month, perhaps oftener at certain seasons of\r\nthe year. They may be held in the schoolhouse Friday afternoon, and\r\nthe young pupils and others, not members of the club, may be guests.\r\nOccasional evening meetings with social features and refreshments should\r\nbe held.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of club meetings a good club leader (or teacher) will\r\nremain in the background as much as possible, permitting the officers\r\nof the club to conduct the meeting. Parents, patrons, members of the\r\nadvisory committee, and outside speakers should have a place on certain\r\nprograms, but it should ever be borne in mind that the club is for boys\r\nand girls, and care should be exercised that the adults do not crowd them\r\noff the programs. A club will be far more successful if it succeeds in\r\nstimulating its own members to take part in club meetings, than if it\r\nmerely fills up its programs with outside speakers.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the club meetings, visits should be made to places\r\nwhere actual club work can be observed. The corn plat, the pig pen, and\r\nthe garden should be utilized in this connection. Observation trips and\r\n“hikes” should be taken to observe ideal conditions on farms or in homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROGRAM\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n(1) Roll call.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  Purpose of organization.\r\n  How we are connected with other organizations.\r\n  What others will do for us.\r\n  What we will do for ourselves.\r\n  What we will do for others.\r\n  How we are going to make our club a success.\r\n\r\nDiscussions of assignments for months.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of record books.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG CLUB PROGRAMS\r\n\r\n(1) Roll call, answered by naming breeds or breed characteristics.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  Origin of swine.\r\n  Characteristics of lard hog.\r\n  Characteristics of bacon hog.\r\n\r\nDemonstration: Locating and naming parts of a hog from a drawing,\r\npicture, or chart\r\n\r\n(2) Roll call, answered by names of prominent breeders.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  History of Duroc-Jersey.\r\n  History of Poland China.\r\n  History of Chester White.\r\n  History of Berkshire.\r\n  History of Hampshire.\r\n\r\n(3) Roll call, answered by naming essentials for a healthy herd.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  Mineral matter in the ration.\r\n  Sanitary hog houses.\r\n  Individual hog houses vs. the colony hog house.\r\n  Dipping hogs.\r\n\r\nDemonstration: Making an individual hog house, using blackboard or model.\r\n\r\n(4) Roll call, answered by naming forage crops suitable for swine.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  Alfalfa pasture.\r\n  Rape.\r\n  Other kinds of pasture.\r\n\r\n(5) Roll call, answered by naming feeds suitable for swine.\r\n\r\nTalks on:\r\n\r\n  Home grown feeds.\r\n  Feeds that must be purchased.\r\n\r\nDemonstration: Blackboard explanation of nutritive ratio of a feed or a\r\nration.\r\n\r\n(6) Judging contest: Each member to place three hogs.\r\n\r\n(Basis of award: placing, 50; reasons, 50.)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES ON PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\n(Books)\r\n\r\n  Productive Swine Husbandry—Day.
