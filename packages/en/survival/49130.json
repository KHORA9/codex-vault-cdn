I imbibed an early taste for the sciences from my\r\nfather, the late Professor Edmund Otis Hovey, D. D., one of the founders\r\nof Wabash College, and a pioneer geologist in Indiana. My annual\r\nvacations, during a busy professional career spanning over fifty years,\r\nhave largely been given to underground explorations.\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen years old I began cave-hunting amid the charming grottoes\r\nnear Madison, Indiana. An enthusiastic comrade, six years my senior,\r\nthen proposed that we visit the Mammoth Cave. For certain reasons, while\r\nhe went on, I got no farther at that time than Louisville; where,\r\nhowever, I bought, at the bookstore of Morton and Griswold, a copy of\r\n“Rambles in the Mammoth Cave, by a Visitor.” It was just out. It fired\r\nmy boyish imagination, and it gave shape to much of my after life.\r\n\r\nMore than four hundred books, pamphlets, scientific reports, and\r\nmagazine articles have been published by different writers, besides\r\ninnumerable newspaper contributions, about Kentucky’s great cavern.\r\nCopies of most of these are in the author’s library.\r\n\r\nYet there is a demand, and there seems to be room, for such a practical,\r\ncondensed, and up-to-date hand-book as is now offered. It does not claim\r\nto tell all that might be told; and it omits much material that might\r\ninterest the historian or the scientist. Its design is to aid the\r\naverage visitor as he follows the four regulation routes by which the\r\nCave is ordinarily exhibited.\r\n\r\nThose who covet more abundant information as to places not often\r\nvisited, or concerning the cavern fauna and flora, or as to details of\r\nlocal history, or as to Mammoth Cave bibliography, are referred to the\r\nlarger Illustrated Manual of Mammoth Cave, by Hovey and Call, published\r\nby John P. Morton and Company, and for sale at the Cave. My still more\r\ncomprehensive work on “Celebrated American Caverns,” now out of print,\r\nmay be found on the shelves of most public libraries.\r\n\r\nThe revised Guide Map (1907 and 1909) in this volume, and for sale (on a\r\nlarger scale) at the Cave hotel, was made by me from an original partial\r\nsurvey, earlier charts being consulted, especially those by Stephen\r\nBishop and Dr. C. R. Blackall, with a few corrections and additions\r\nsuggested by Mr. Max Kaemper, to whom thanks are also due for important\r\nfacts concerning his discoveries in 1908. The route-sketches found in\r\nthis hand-book were redrawn from those made by him.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are likewise due to my son, Dr. E. O. Hovey, of New York\r\nCity; to my former comrade in cave-hunting, Dr. R. Ellsworth Call; to\r\nBenj. F. Einbigler, Norman A. Parrish, and others, for valuable\r\ncorrespondence and memoranda; to the late Mr. Ben Hains and Mr. H. M.\r\nPinson, photographers; to Mr. H. C. Ganter for use of copyrighted cuts;\r\nto the officials of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for additional\r\nillustrative material, as well as for other courtesies and favors; and\r\nparticularly to the trustees, managers, and guides of Mammoth Cave for\r\nheartily and generously facilitating explorations in former and more\r\nrecent years, without which this work would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nFinally, for information as to trains via the Louisville and Nashville\r\nRailroad and connections at Glasgow Junction with the Mammoth Cave\r\nRailroad; for the arrival and departure of steamboats on Green River;\r\nfor terms of Cave routes and guides, and for hotel rates by the day or\r\nthe week, and for other details not within the scope of this hand-book,\r\napplication may be made to the Mammoth Cave Manager, at Mammoth Cave,\r\nKentucky. Our simple aim is to aid and entertain the reader in his\r\nsubterranean rambles.\r\n\r\n                                                        Horace C. Hovey.\r\n\r\nNewburyport, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Mammoth Cave\r\n                              OF KENTUCKY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                A Short Lesson In Geology and Chemistry\r\n\r\n\r\nMany hurry to and through and away from Mammoth Cave; but let us go in a\r\nmore leisurely manner. Suppose we begin by a stroll amid the rounded\r\nhills that environ Cincinnati. We find their flanks full of corals,\r\nshells, crinoids, and other marine objects by myriads. These are\r\nfossils, yet perfect as if freshly cast up from the sea. But we observe\r\nthat the limestone lies in thin, level layers, with no signs of volcanic\r\nor earthquake action. They were gently cut down by an undermining\r\nprocess that left no caverns, because the strata are so thin that they\r\ncan not hold together. This is the same Lower Silurian formation that\r\nelsewhere made the famous “bluegrass region,” causing Central Kentucky\r\nto be the fairest bit of the globe’s surface known.\r\n\r\nGo by steamboat down the Ohio to Madison, Indiana, and the scenery\r\nchanges with the geology. Near the river are still seen the thin blue\r\nlimestone strata that we saw at Cincinnati, but capped by the marble\r\nheights of the Upper Silurian. Cascades from the cliffs wash out the\r\nthinner, softer material, making wide, shallow grottoes, each being, as\r\na rule, at the head of a ravine, which is a cave in ruins.\r\n\r\nAt the charming city of Louisville we encounter another geological\r\nchange, and meet a striking proof that the region was once flooded by\r\nthe ocean, namely, the grand old coral reef over which tumble the Falls\r\nof the Ohio. It used to bristle with branching corals like stag-horns\r\nand was strewn with tens of thousands of more delicate varieties,\r\ncar-loads of which have since been carried away; but enough remain to\r\nshow that all this country was uplifted by continental forces from a\r\nprimeval sea. Probably its altitude was once above the present level, to\r\nwhich it has been reduced by causes some of which are still at work.\r\n\r\nRambling through the valleys and examining their rocky beds, we find\r\nfissures no doubt caused by that continental uplifting to which we have\r\nreferred. These cracks, or “joints,” are visible over large areas,\r\nwherever the country rock is exposed. Usually they run at nearly right\r\nangles with one another, north and south lines crossing those from east\r\nto west. The joint-walls may closely fit, or have been parted to make\r\nchannels by which falling rain might be drained.\r\n\r\nYou have noticed that soda-water roughens and eats away the marble slab\r\non which the soda-fountain rests. On asking the reason you are told that\r\nit is due to the carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide) with which the water\r\nis charged. In nature this same gas is formed by the decay of animal and\r\nvegetable matter. Rainwater absorbs it from the atmosphere and while\r\nsinking through the loam and soil. It also takes up humous acids, which\r\naid in the work of corrasion effected on reaching the limestone.\r\nMechanical energy assists chemical action in slowly dissolving and\r\nremoving the limestone particles.\r\n\r\nAll limestone caves, great and small, were carved by this slow yet\r\nirresistible process. The downward flow follows the joints till a\r\nlateral “bedding-plane,” or something else, turns the stream\r\nhorizontally, when there results a widening of the passageway. Should\r\nthe roof collapse there would be “a tumble-down” within and perhaps a\r\n“sink-hole” without. Should the cave cut through from one bedding-plane\r\nto another, a series of galleries would result; the upper ones dry as\r\ntinder and the lower ones wet with water that finally reaches the\r\ndrainage level, whence it emerges into some open valley.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the whirling water bores straight down through all\r\ngalleries, making what is termed a pit, or a dome, according to the\r\npoint of view. Standing pools deposit nitrous earth and various other\r\nmineral substances. Water trickling through the roof evaporates, each\r\ndrop laying down its load of the bicarbonate of lime to create a\r\nstalactite; or a stalagmite if it first falls on the floor. A general\r\nand convenient term is “dripstone,” masses of which are found at almost\r\nany crossing of the joint-planes. Should “fixed air” (carbon dioxide),\r\nwhich is fifteen times as heavy as the atmosphere, settle into the lower\r\nparts of any cave, it would make visiting dangerous or fatal. But air\r\ncurrents and other causes make every part of Mammoth Cave free from any\r\nexcept the sweetest, purest air ever inhaled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Approaching Mammoth Cave\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to an authentic article in the Louisville Courier-Journal for\r\nSeptember 29, 1901, the managers of Mammoth Cave, having occasion to\r\nexamine the records at Bowling Green, found that cave designated as a\r\ncorner of a section of land in 1797; which antedates by some years the\r\nthreadbare legend of Houchins and the wounded bear.\r\n\r\nDuring the saltpeter times, 1812-1816, elsewhere described, men came and\r\nwent in carts or on horseback. Seventy years ago Dr. Davidson told the\r\nTransylvania University about visiting the “Green River country,” so\r\ncalled in honor of General Nathaniel Green, the hero of Eutaw\r\nSprings—not for its emerald tint. He hired a barouche at Henderson and\r\ntraversed a dozen counties to Mammoth Cave, which Dr. John Croghan had\r\njust purchased for $10,000, intending to “clear out the avenues and make\r\nthem accessible for an omnibus to the distance of three or four miles,\r\nand erect a sort of hotel in the Temple” (the old name of the Chief\r\nCity).\r\n\r\nCharmingly did Julius Benedict, sixty years ago, narrate the adventures\r\nof Jenny Lind and her party, as they went “by the very worst road in the\r\nUnited States, but amid most delightful forest scenery,” from Nashville\r\nto Bowling Green, and thence to Bell’s Tavern, that famous old hostelry.\r\nThe rest of their journey lay along the edge of “jagged, abrupt glens,\r\nalong sweeping meadows and budding woodlands,” to the queer old building\r\nwhere “Dr. Croghan did the honors of his subterranean dominions in the\r\nmost agreeable manner.”\r\n\r\nAs recently as my own early visits a line of stage coaches ran from Cave\r\nCity, owned by Andy McCoy and managed by Henry C. Ganter, who still\r\nentertains willing listeners at the Cave hotel by his racy stories of\r\npioneer days. How grandly the bugle-flourish used to herald the coming\r\nstage-coach, and how everybody used to rush to greet the passengers, and\r\nhow eagerly the negro servants cared for the luggage! Guests still come\r\nby carriage, on horseback, or by automobile; and many avail themselves\r\nof the steamboats plying on Green River, where a system of locks and\r\ndams has made it practicable to land within half a mile of the Cave\r\nentrance. No more delightful river-ride than this can be found in the\r\nMiddle West, or more diversified by frowning cliffs, wild forests,\r\nopening amphitheatres that smile in summer with rustling fields of corn,\r\nwith here and there attractive villages and flourishing cities.\r\n\r\nBut the majority avail themselves of the Louisville and Nashville\r\nRailroad, connecting with the Mammoth Cave Short-line, whose terminus is\r\nnear the Cave hotel. One enjoys the comforts of modern travel while\r\npassing by a magnificent panorama of hill, valley, and undulating plain.\r\n“Knobs” several hundred feet high, capped by the Chester sandstone,\r\nabove the solid St. Louis limestone, appear as cones or pyramids, whose\r\nstrata remain horizontal from base to apex. Amid the Knobs run\r\nstream-swept valleys. In level regions are fertile farms, though\r\nfrequently the soil is iron-stained a fiery red. One could hardly find\r\nanywhere a more charming trip by rail than from Louisville to Glasgow\r\nJunction, or one more unique than from the latter station to Mammoth\r\nCave.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: In Cave Costume]\r\n\r\nOval depressions abound, styled “sink-holes,” because through them the\r\nsurface water sinks out of sight. So numerous are they that one might\r\ntraverse the cave-region on horseback all day long and not cross an open\r\nstream; all the rainwater being drained through them to underground\r\ngathering-beds, to re-appear in such cave-fed streams as Green River.\r\nThe Short-line Railway from Glasgow Junction to Mammoth Cave passes a\r\nnumber of remarkably large sink-holes, one of the widest being “Eden\r\nValley,” covering two thousand acres, with no inlet or outlet except\r\nthrough pits that are conjectured to lead to the Colossal and the\r\nMammoth caves.\r\n\r\nOn the authority of the late Professor Shaler it is said that there are\r\nfour thousand sink-holes and five hundred known caverns in Edmondson\r\nCounty alone. In this little hand-book we can not be expected to give a\r\nlist of them. In the vicinity of Mammoth Cave are several that have\r\ncelebrity, and would amply reward the attention of a visitor. Among them\r\nmay be mentioned Ganter, Diamond, Procter, Salt, and White caves. The\r\nlast two belong to the Mammoth Cave estate, and are occasionally visited\r\nby tourists. The Salt Cave is remarkable for prehistoric relics, and the\r\nWhite Cave for its stalactites. Dixon Cave also is noteworthy as having\r\nprobably been the original mouth of Mammoth Cave. It is an immense\r\nchamber, fifteen hundred feet long, from sixty to eighty feet wide, and\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred and twenty-five feet high, and was once\r\nworked for saltpeter. The Colossal Cavern, belonging to the Louisville\r\nand Nashville Railroad, is but a mile and a half distant, and is noted\r\nfor its magnificence.\r\n\r\nThus far the woodman’s axe has spared the grand old forest trees on the\r\nestate, except as needed for firewood, and many delightful rambles are\r\nto be had among them. Game used to abound, and still rewards the\r\nskillful hunter, and Green River abounds in fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Ownership of the Cave\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McLean bought the Cave and two hundred acres around it, in 1811, for\r\nforty dollars, and soon sold it to Mr. Gatewood, who in turn sold it to\r\nMessrs. Gratz and Wilkins, who sent Mr. Archibald Miller from\r\nPhiladelphia to manage saltpeter works for them during the War of 1812,\r\nat a time when an embargo cut off foreign sources of supply. The Cave\r\nestate, with sixteen hundred acres of land, passed into the hands of Mr.\r\nJames Moore, a Philadelphia merchant, in 1816, and when he was ruined by\r\nthe Burr and Blennerhasset fiasco, Gatewood took it again and made it a\r\n“show-cave.” Mr. Frank Gorin bought the property in 1837, and made\r\nMiller and Moore his agents, with Stephen Bishop and Matt Bransford as\r\nguides. Discoveries followed so fast as to draw public attention at home\r\nand abroad.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this natural wonder reached a young physician of Louisville,\r\nDr. John Croghan, while traveling in Europe, and on his return he became\r\nso charmed with the Cave that he bought it from Mr. Gorin for $10,000,\r\nand also purchased two thousand acres about it, in order to control any\r\nother possible entrances than the main one. To the original miner’s\r\ncabin, Mr. James Miller, his agent, added in 1835 the long row of log\r\ncabins still used by guests; since joined by wide porches and modernized\r\nby frame additions and all conveniences. Among the agents who have\r\nexhibited the Cave or run the hotel, or both, are Messrs. Archibald,\r\nJames, William, and W. Scott Miller, Larkin J. Procter, Mr. Owsley, D.\r\nL. Graves, Francis Klett, W. C. Comstock, Henry C. Ganter, and L. F.\r\nCharlet.\r\n\r\nThe will of Dr. Croghan, probated February 5, 1849, left the entire\r\nMammoth Cave estate in the hands of trustees for the benefit of his nine\r\nnephews and nieces, namely, the sons and daughters of Colonel George\r\nCroghan and General T. S. Jesup; with the proviso that when they should\r\nall have died, the trustees should sell the estate at public auction.\r\nUnless some of the heirs should buy it, a desirable purchaser might be\r\nthe Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company; or the entire group of\r\ncaverns in the vicinity might be converted into a State or national\r\npark. Meanwhile we are content that it should remain under the excellent\r\nmanagement of the present trustees.\r\n\r\nNo guides are employed but those who are trustworthy. Stephen Bishop and\r\nMatt Bransford have passed away; so have Nicholas Bransford and William\r\nGarvin. Tom Lee, my first guide, and John M. Nelson, with whom I have\r\nmade many an underground trip, are not now in service. Those whom one is\r\nlikely to meet at present are Edward Bishop, William Bransford, Robert\r\nLively, and Joshua Wilson, with several other capable guides at hand for\r\nemergencies. All are heroes of many adventures, and their strong arms\r\nhave rescued many a visitor from disaster. Their word is law, and no one\r\nis allowed to enter without a guide. Hence accidents are of rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe fact so widely heralded that, in the spring of 1909, a party of\r\n“Shriners” got lost in the Cave for eight hours, was wholly due to their\r\nrefusing to obey the guides, and breaking away from their comrades under\r\nthe voluntary and unauthorized leadership of one of their own number. As\r\nsoon as possible guides were dispatched to their rescue, who brought\r\nthem safely out to the open air.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of visitors, as well as with reasonable\r\nconsideration for the guides themselves, certain hours and routes are\r\nfixed, from which it is not customary to depart, unless by special\r\narrangement with the management. Four routes are mapped out, the uniform\r\ncharge for each being two dollars. For terms for the season, or for\r\nlarge parties, etc., as well as for information as to hotel rates, and\r\nindeed for anything special, visitors should apply to the Mammoth Cave\r\nmanager. Cave suits are to let, and proper methods of illumination are\r\nprovided by the guides. Even a few hours of wandering below ground will\r\nbe worth while; but those who can remain amid these wonderful scenes for\r\na longer period will be amply repaid by incessantly varying sights and\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: “Martha Washington’s Statue”]\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration:       COPYRIGHT 1908 BY H.

Evidently it is where the roof broke\r\ndown long ago; for the lower valley was doubtless once part of the\r\ncavern, and so was what is now known as Dixon Cave. The present Cave\r\nmouth is seven hundred and thirty-five feet above sea level, one hundred\r\nand ninety-four feet above the level of Green River, and one hundred and\r\neighteen feet below the crest of the overhanging bluff. The limestone\r\nstratum is three hundred and twenty-eight feet thick, measuring from the\r\nsandstone above to the drainage level below; and within these limits all\r\nthe vast labyrinth extends its ramifications.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things noticed by the visitor is the strong current of\r\ncool air that flows from the Cave mouth, frequently too strong to allow\r\nthe carrying of lighted lamps until a point is reached many yards\r\nwithin, where the gale dies away. As we descend the solid stone stairway\r\nwe observe with pleasure a waterfall that leaps from the ledge, gleams\r\nin the sunlight, and vanishes amid the rocks on the floor. Around us\r\nhang festoons of vines and ferns, and before us is the noble vestibule\r\nto a temple of eternal night.\r\n\r\nAn iron gate is unlocked for us, put there to prevent unpaid intrusion\r\nand vandal spoliation. Passing through, we bid farewell to daylight, and\r\ndepend on the simple iron lamps given to each of us by the guide. The\r\nlegend that a hunter named Houchins, in 1809, chased a wounded bear into\r\nthis throat of the cave, whether authentic or not, is perpetuated in the\r\nname given it, Houchins’ Narrows, made still narrower by the blocks of\r\nlimestone piled in walls on either side, thus leaving a passage only a\r\nfew feet wide. To the left is the tomb of two Indians found in early\r\ndays and reburied here. No monument marks the grave of these nameless\r\naborigines. Considering the fact that the Cave was resorted to by many\r\ngenerations of red men, it is remarkable that so few human remains have\r\nrewarded diligent search.\r\n\r\nWhat are these wooden pipes along the floor? They were laid there by the\r\nsaltpeter miners to convey the water from the cascade at the entrance\r\ndown to the leaching vats that are now pointed out to us in the Rotunda.\r\nThe ruts of old ox-carts are visible in which the “peter-dirt” was\r\ncarried to the vats from the open avenues, while sacks were used for\r\nthose more remote. The solution was pumped out to open-air boilers, run\r\nthrough ash-hoppers, cooled in crystallization troughs, and packed for\r\ntransportation to the seaboard, mostly by mules. Thus did patriotic\r\nKentucky supply the government with one of the ingredients of gunpowder,\r\nat a time when foreign sources were cut off. The yield of nitrate was\r\nfour pounds to the bushel of soil, and the vast heaps of lixiviated\r\nearth seem to warrant the boast that Mammoth Cave alone “could supply\r\nthe whole population of the globe with saltpeter.”\r\n\r\nThe lofty arch of the Rotunda is directly under the Hotel; and it would\r\nbe possible, by means of a shaft, to supply every room with the sweetest\r\nand purest air, transforming it into a “lime-air” sanitarium, as has\r\nactually been done in some other localities. By a series of temperature\r\nobservations with verified thermometers, the writer has proved that the\r\nuniform temperature of the Cave is 54° Fahr., winter and summer; and the\r\nair is chemically and optically pure. Lighted by magnesium fire the\r\ngrandeur of this first of many halls is made visible, as are also the\r\nopenings of two broad avenues, one of them being the Main Cave and the\r\nother the entrance to Audubon Avenue and Little Bat Avenue. Here in\r\nwinter assemble myriads of bats from all the region around, clustering\r\nin nooks and crevices for their long sleep of hibernation.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: Entrance to Mammoth Cave]\r\n\r\nLeaving Audubon Avenue to be described in Route II, we enter from it, at\r\na point some five hundred feet from the Rotunda, and by a low arch, the\r\nwinding way known as Little Bat Avenue, chiefly remarkable as leading to\r\nthe Crevice Pit, which is immediately over the Ruins of Karnak. The\r\nstory is told by the late Dr. R. M. Bird that a former owner, Mr.\r\nWilkins, let a lamp down the pit by a rope that caught fire, with the\r\nloss of the lamp. A reward of two dollars was offered for its recovery.\r\nA little darkey agreed to be let down, as a sort of living plummet, to\r\nsound the depth of the chasm. He told such a tale as to the magnificent\r\ntemple underneath, with its tall columns and splendid adornments, that\r\nnobody believed him. Thirty years later the lost lamp was found by old\r\nMatt, the guide, who gave it to me.\r\n\r\nThe Main Cave, or Grand Gallery, or as we like to style it the\r\n“Broadway” of this subterranean metropolis, extends from the Rotunda to\r\nthe Cataracts, and must be traversed to reach any other part of the\r\ncavern. In this first route only about eight hundred yards of it are\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nHigh overhead springs an arch eighty feet wide and resting on vertical\r\nwalls. Presently the guide calls our attention to the exit of the\r\nCorkscrew, on our left, an extraordinary passageway by which we are to\r\nreturn after visiting the River Hall. If we happen here as another party\r\nis returning, a curious effect is produced by their torches emerging one\r\nat a time in a procession winding down the Kentucky Cliffs. But now we\r\nadvance along the worn cart-road made by the saltpeter miners, strewn by\r\ntheir ancient log-conduits, which are strangely preserved during the\r\ncentury that has elapsed since some of them were first brought hither.\r\nLift one and you will be astonished to find how light they are. At the\r\njunction of the Main Cave and Archibald Avenue is the “Church,” where\r\nthe pious miners used to hear the message of salvation taught by\r\nitinerant preachers, and where in more recent days many a sermon has\r\nbeen preached and many a psalm been sung, awakening echoes from the\r\ncavern walls.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: Leaving the “Corkscrew”]\r\n\r\nReserving the Gothic Avenue for another visit, we note, as we pass\r\nalong, the grotesque figures of animals and birds made by the deposits\r\nof the black oxide of manganese overhead. Mark well the Standing Rocks,\r\nwhich fell edge-downward ages ago, set free from the roof possibly by\r\nsome earthquake shock. Now we walk awe-struck under the Grand Arch,\r\nwhere the guides effect a marvelous surprise by means of simple\r\nillumination. They burn chemical fires at a point near the saltpeter\r\nvats, some five hundred feet to the rear of us, and the contour of the\r\nwalls brings out a statuesque effect which is aptly styled “Martha\r\nWashington’s Statue.” It requires but little play of the imagination to\r\nfancy it a marble representation of that eminent lady of Colonial times.\r\n\r\nAn immense rock lies near the right-hand wall, forty-five feet long,\r\neighteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high, which used to be called the\r\nSteamboat; but it is now known as the Giant’s Coffin. The\r\nquasi-sarcophagus may have been torn from the adjacent wall by some\r\nconvulsion, or it may simply have fallen and lodged in its present\r\nsuggestive position. Its weight is estimated at two thousand tons. It is\r\none of the great landmarks, and though we should pass it many times it\r\nis impossible to do so without being impressed by its solitary grandeur,\r\nrivaling as it does the blocks of Baalbec in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe route now taken leads us behind the Giant’s Coffin, through a low\r\nand narrow passage which would never have been discovered had not the\r\nmonster rock fallen. This is styled Dante’s Gateway, from which a rude\r\nstairway leads us into the Wooden Bowl Room, so named either from its\r\npeculiar shape or because an Indian wooden bowl was found there. To the\r\nleft is the opening to what has variously been styled Indian Avenue,\r\nBlacksnake Avenue, and Welcome Avenue. Really it is a combination of\r\nseveral avenues, running for the distance of eight thousand five hundred\r\nfeet, as measured by the writer, which have been made passable by the\r\nskill and industry of Mr. H. C. Ganter when he was manager of the Cave,\r\nand which for this reason is generally called Ganter Avenue. Its inner\r\nend is at Serpent Hall, and it gives an exit for any one who may get\r\ncaught beyond the rivers by a sudden rise of water.\r\n\r\nOur present path goes through the “Dog-Hole,” down a stairway fancifully\r\ncalled “The Steeps of Time,” leading into the region of pits and domes.\r\nWe pause a while by Richardson’s Spring, which is a small pool filled by\r\na running stream that has worn for itself a narrow channel in the rock,\r\nillustrating what has been done for the entire Cave on a grander scale.\r\nSmall crustaceans are found in this clear pool, and blind insects abound\r\nunder the flat rocks near by. Numberless blind crickets leap away from\r\nus, and white eyeless spiders, brown beetles, thousand-legged worms, and\r\nother abnormal forms of life are found by careful search. Nothing\r\nharmful, however, appears, either here or elsewhere. As a rule cave-life\r\nis timid.\r\n\r\nSide-saddle Pit, fifty feet deep, was named from its imagined\r\nresemblance to a lady’s saddle. Above it rises Minerva’s Dome, thirty\r\nfeet high. The spot used to be dangerous, but is now guarded by a stout\r\nrailing. Once a terrier leaped down the Chasm after a fire-ball flung by\r\na guide. The guide’s wife allowed herself to be lowered by a rope and\r\nrescued the poor dog, which did not seem to be seriously hurt by his\r\nperilous adventure. Calypso’s Avenue, to the left, leads to the Covered\r\nPit and Scylla and Charybdis, which are rarely visited.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance to the Labyrinth is a window through which we behold\r\nthe wonderful and lofty chamber discovered by a former owner of the\r\nCave, Mr. Frank Gorin, in whose honor it is named Gorin’s Dome. Perhaps\r\nthe earliest account of it was that published by Dr. Davidson. Its\r\nheight, as measured by myself with the aid of a cluster of small\r\nballoons, is one hundred and sixty feet, its width is thirty-five feet\r\nand its length sixty feet. Its vertical walls sweep in an S-shaped curve\r\nand spring from the river level to the apex of the dome, with projecting\r\nbosses of coral and with cascades that awake the echoes as they fall.\r\n\r\nDarnall’s Way was cut through the sandbank, in 1896, to the summit,\r\nwhere a bridge cast directly across the abyss gives us the most complete\r\nview to be had of the locality. One remarkable feature is a folded\r\nalabaster curtain one hundred and nineteen feet high. By casting\r\nfire-balls down the whole interior is grandly illuminated. Davidson\r\ndescended to the bottom, as others have occasionally done since, by\r\nmeans of a well some thirty feet deep, down which one clambers like a\r\nchimney-sweep. He found there “stretching away in midnight blackness a\r\nhorrid pool of water.” In 1863 Mr. F. J. Stevenson, of London, had a\r\nboat made and lowered through the window, on which he floated away for\r\nseven long hours on a perilous voyage that no man has since then\r\nrepeated. The water now setting back from Green River has closed the\r\nentrance to what we term “Stevenson’s Lost River”; but his old boat\r\nstill lies where it was stranded at the bottom of Gorin’s Dome.\r\n\r\nAnother huge abyss, the Bottomless Pit, was long regarded as ending\r\nfurther progress, till Stephen Bishop crossed it in 1840 by means of a\r\nslender cedar sapling thrown over the yawning gulf; since when it has\r\nbeen spanned by a substantial and safe bridge. Instead of being\r\n“bottomless” it is exactly one hundred and five feet deep. Above it is\r\nShelby’s Dome, named for the first Governor of Kentucky. Balls of cotton\r\nwaste saturated with coal-oil are flung down by the guides, which\r\ngrandly display the wrinkled and corrugated walls of the pit. Looking\r\ndirectly across, we see an opening through which the writer and William\r\nGarvin emerged from their explorations around Scylla and Charybdis.\r\nThere are other ways of approach, one from Gorin’s Dome, another from\r\nnear the Scotchman’s Trap, and still another from River Hall to the very\r\nbottom, from which the upward view almost equals that from the base of\r\nGorin’s Dome. All this great group of pits is connected below to form an\r\nimmense hall, about four hundred feet long, which at high water is\r\nflooded by the overflow from River Hall. By Special permission, of\r\nformer President of the United States Benjamin Harrison, this vast room\r\nwas named Harrison Hall.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: “Bottomless Pit”]\r\n\r\nOn crossing the Bridge of Sighs we find an enlargement of the Cave\r\nformerly used as a dining place, and hence known as Reveller’s Hall.\r\nPensico Avenue, along which we go, is crossed underneath by an invisible\r\npassageway, causing sounds to be reproduced in Echo Chamber with\r\nmarvelous reverberations. Wending our way amid the huge rocks that\r\nencumber Wild Hall we next reach the Grand Crossing, and beyond it the\r\nsingular dry stalactite, the Pineapple Bush, and end our path in\r\nAngelica’s Grotto, with its curious Hanging Grove.\r\n\r\nRetracing our steps to Reveller’s Hall, we descend by an opening\r\noverhung by an enormous slab so poised as to make it seem as if a\r\ncareless breath might make it fall. This is the Scotchman’s Trap, so\r\nnamed for a canny Scot who refused to go farther lest he should be\r\nentrapped. But we dive under and go on, coming presently to the Fat\r\nMan’s Misery. This is a serpentine passage, its walls changing direction\r\neight times in two hundred and thirty-six feet, its width but eighteen\r\ninches and its height in places only five feet. It is indeed enough to\r\ntry a fat man’s soul and body. The sides are marked by ripples and\r\nwaves, and are polished by the friction of many vexed visitors.\r\n\r\nThe fattest man that ever went through weighed two hundred and\r\neighty-two pounds at the start, but avers that he lost twenty pounds in\r\nthe process. Another, a jovial son of Erin, stuck fast and was left to\r\nhis fate. Later he turned up all right and explained matters in his own\r\nway. He said that he remembered every sin he had ever committed; and\r\nwhen he called to mind how, at a certain recent hotly contested\r\nelection, he voted the wrong ticket by mistake, it made him feel so\r\nsmall that he got free from the Fat Man’s Misery quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe room into which we emerge is fitly styled “Great Relief”; and from\r\nit we enter the Bacon Chamber, where Nature in a frolicsome mood has\r\ncarved the limestone into masses resembling rows of hams and shoulders\r\nin a packing-house. Near by is the Dining Hall, where, on occasion,\r\nwell-filled tables are spread.\r\n\r\nA special trip can be made through Spark’s Avenue, entered from Bandit\r\nHall, and leading on to the Mammoth Dome. We first visited it in 1878,\r\nand were assured that no one had been there for seven years. A\r\ntreacherous old ladder was then the only means of descending to the\r\nfloor, which sloped away to a pool whose waters received a cascade\r\nfalling from the lofty apex. The ladder has been replaced by a\r\nsubstantial stairway, by crossing which we reach the Egyptian Temple, or\r\nthe Ruins of Karnak. Six columns eighty feet high and twenty-five feet\r\nin diameter stand in a semicircle, each deeply fluted, veneered by\r\nyellow stalagmite and covered by mimic tracery. Overhead is the black\r\nopening already mentioned as the Crevice Pit; and underneath are\r\nextensive catacombs rarely visited. Dr. Call’s measurement of the\r\nextreme height, from the cascade pool to the summit of the dome above\r\nthe Crevice Pit, was one hundred and fifty feet; which was later\r\nconfirmed by my balloon system of measurement. The total length of the\r\nroom is not far from four hundred feet.\r\n\r\nRiver Hall, to which we now return, might be said to extend for miles,\r\nwere we to include all the known branches of subterranean waters. So\r\nunlike is it to the Main Cave that we might almost be said to have\r\nentered another cavern—which would really be true. What is called in a\r\ngeneral way Mammoth Cave is a congeries of different caves, whose walls\r\nand floors were first thinned and then broken through by the agency of\r\nwater, until was formed the immense and greatly diversified labyrinth\r\nwhose mazes we are exploring. Here is the gathering-bed of hundreds of\r\nsink-holes opening from the surface. The exit is in deep, bubbling pools\r\nalong Green River, of which the Upper and Lower Big Springs are\r\nexamples. And when Green River is flooded by freshets its waters back\r\nthrough such secret channels and also flood River Hall by a body of\r\nwater from thirty to one hundred feet in depth and fully two miles long,\r\nwith capricious currents and perilous whirlpools. Navigation at such\r\ntimes is forbidden; but at low water it is entirely safe, under the care\r\nof our skillful guides.\r\n\r\nSullen waters reposing at the foot of a cliff sixty feet high are called\r\nthe Dead Sea, though not bitter but sweet, as those may find who venture\r\ndown to the margin. An iron railing guards the way as we descend to a\r\nlower terrace. Presently, on the right, we see a cascade, that falls\r\ninto a funnel-shaped hollow and vanishes. Near by, in 1881, the writer\r\nfound a natural mushroom bed, that suggested the idea of a mushroom\r\nfarm, but with meager results because located in Audubon Avenue, where\r\nirrigation is impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe black waters of the River Styx wind between steep walls for some\r\nfour hundred feet, and with an average breadth of forty feet. Formerly\r\nit was passed over by boat, but now by a natural bridge protected by a\r\nguard-rail. Lake Lethe is next in order, along whose border we go\r\ncautiously, in hope of seeing specimens of the famous eyeless fish\r\n(_Amblyopsis speleus_) that abound in these waters. They seldom exceed\r\nthree or four inches in length, are colorless, have cartilage instead of\r\nbones, are viviparous, and are so sensitive to approach that they dart\r\naway if a grain of sand falls on the water. The blind white crawfish\r\n(_Cambarus pellucidus_) is often seen. These creatures were first\r\ndescribed by Dr. Davidson, two years previous to their being mentioned\r\nby DeKay, who was credited by Agassiz as their discoverer.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Banquet Hall in Mammoth Cave]\r\n\r\nThe Great Walk for four hundred yards used to be admired, but now its\r\nbeautiful yellow sand is covered by the back-water from the rivers. The\r\nroof here is mottled like snow-clouds. Midway the mask of Shakespeare is\r\npointed out, and other objects of interest are visible. Stephen Bishop,\r\nJohn Craig, and Brice Patton first crossed these rivers, over which\r\nthousands have since safely voyaged. A fleet of flat-boats awaits us,\r\nthe material for which was brought in by way of the Crevice Pit. Each\r\nboat has seats for some twenty persons, while the guide propels the\r\nprimitive craft by his paddle.\r\n\r\nFour arches open to the Echo River, only the fourth being ordinarily\r\navailable. To reach this we cross the Sandy Sahara and flounder through\r\nthe Slough of Purgatory. The voyage abounds in most enjoyable\r\nadventures, though care must be taken not to upset amid waters that have\r\nno shores except at the landing-places. A few years ago a party, mainly\r\nof journalists, managed to swamp their boat, but were rescued by the\r\npresence of mind of all concerned, particularly the strong-armed and\r\nfaithful guide, John M. Nelson, whose orders they obeyed.\r\n\r\nEcho River varies in width from twenty to two hundred feet, under an\r\narchway averaging thirty feet in height, the depth varying from five to\r\ntwenty-five feet, and its level being only about twenty feet above that\r\nof Green River. The portion over which visitors are taken is perhaps\r\nhalf a mile or more long. All along its margin, where the rock abruptly\r\nmeets the water, are countless cavities that have been washed out by the\r\nstream. These gave a wag in our party on first crossing the river his\r\nchance, and he cried, “Oh, see these little bits of caves, three for\r\nfive cents!” Then awoke the echoes and carried the sound away and away\r\ntill he was ashamed of himself. Then a lady in black velvet Cave\r\ncostume, with tiny bells along the fringe to keep her from getting lost,\r\nsang the “Sweet Bye and Bye.” A revolver was fired, answered by a “Rebel\r\nYell.” Flute and cornet were played with magical effect.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: On Echo River]\r\n\r\nThe term “echo” misleads; for what is given is really a wonderful\r\nprolongation of sound, lasting five, ten, or even twenty minutes. The\r\ntunnel’s own key-note when struck excites harmonics of depth and\r\nsweetness, along with a profound undertone. When the guide agitates the\r\nwater a myriad tiny silver bells tinkle, followed by heavier ones as the\r\nwaves strike the cavities along the walls. This tempest of harmony dies\r\naway with strange mutterings, as if of an angry mob. Mr. Ganter tells of\r\na time when the writer fooled him by causing unearthly shrieks, as of\r\nwretches in mortal agony, at an hour when none were on the river but\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHere ends the First Route. We retrace our steps as far as Bandit Hall,\r\nwhere some one raises the question if there is no way out but by Fat\r\nMan’s Misery. The guide answers, “Yes, by the Corkscrew,” adding the\r\nwarning, “Those who come in by the Fat Man’s Misery go out by the\r\nCorkscrew, and those who come in by the Corkscrew go out by the Fat\r\nMan’s Misery: and whichever way they take, they wish they had taken the\r\nother.” So, up we scramble like so many rats, under or over great\r\nledges, leaping from rock to rock, or climbing ladders, through what\r\nseems like an enormous pit that had been filled in with gigantic rocks,\r\ntill at last, breathless, we emerge upon the Kentucky Cliffs in the Main\r\nCave. A few steps carry us past the saltpeter vats, through the Rotunda,\r\nand the iron gate is unlocked to let us into the vestibule, whence we\r\nclimb the stone stairs to daylight.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: “Bridal Altar”]\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration:       COPYRIGHT 1908 BY H.

It is related that when the great ornithologist visited\r\nRafinesque, the former smashed a fine violin in his eagerness to capture\r\na unique specimen of the bat family. As a kind of amicable revenge the\r\nlatter affixed Audubon’s name to this avenue, where so many myriads of\r\nbats annually hibernate. It is fitting that the great branch to the\r\nleft, sweeping for three hundred and fifty feet and suddenly ending in a\r\ntumble-down, should be named Rafinesque Hall. Unless our visit is in\r\nlate fall or winter, we find but few clusters of bats; but in cold\r\nweather they gather here from near and far and hang head-downward till\r\nsomehow, by a sense not explained, they know it is warm weather\r\nout-of-doors, and then fly forth to the forests. Dr. Call boasts of a\r\nsingle catch that gave him six hundred and seventy bats, of many\r\nvarieties, most of which were sent to the National Museum.\r\n\r\nAdvancing through Audubon Avenue, we soon find the roof and floor\r\napproaching to form what is called Bunker Hill, around which we pass by\r\na narrow defile. The Mushroom Beds attract our attention, to which we\r\nhave already referred as having cost far more than they ever returned by\r\nway of profit, although the idea itself is feasible.\r\n\r\nAbove a floor encumbered by debris hang formations needing an\r\nexplanation. Limpid drops trickle through the roof, saturated with\r\nbicarbonate of lime. The supply of water is constant, but so meager as\r\nto drip instead of flow; and as the dripping goes on each drop lays down\r\nits load as a ring slight enough for a fairy’s finger. Ring follows ring\r\ntill a pendant is formed like a pipestem. The pipestems thicken to the\r\nsize of candles, and often grow as large as tree-trunks. Occasionally\r\nthey broaden into elegant drapery, or are twisted into fantastic shapes.\r\nAll these stone icicles are called “stalactites.”\r\n\r\nSuch lime-laden drops as fall splash about and on evaporation deposit,\r\nnot rings, but films thin as tissue-paper, building up stalagmites that\r\nare solid from their base upwards. Often these downward and upward\r\ngrowths meet as stately shafts, like the pillar named the Sentinel,\r\nwhich guards Olive’s Bower a few steps beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe general term “dripstone” is conveniently applied to all these\r\ndeposits, and their finer varieties are known to the mineralogist as\r\n“oriental alabaster.” A central stalactite in Olive’s Bower is very\r\nlarge and cone-shaped, amid many smaller ones. Below is a rampart,\r\nlooking over which we see, some twenty feet below, a limpid pool that\r\nreflects the overhanging formations. Before leaving the subject of\r\ndripstone it should be remarked that, chemically regarded, it is simply\r\nthe hard carbonate, not the bicarbonate, as is often alleged; the latter\r\nbeing an unstable compound, readily changing on any change of its\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe pit which arrests our progress beyond Olive’s Bower might, if\r\nexplored, prove this locality to be connected with White’s Cave, whose\r\nfeatures it resembles. On returning to the Rotunda we again inspect the\r\nhistoric relics of the War of 1812, and mark the grooves cut in the\r\nlimestone walls by the hubs of the primitive cart-wheels that were\r\nslowly drawn along by oxen to collect the nitrous earth for the\r\nsaltpeter vats. We notice that the bottoms of these vats were made of\r\nsmall logs halved and grooved and laid in layers on supports; the lower\r\nlayer with its grooved surface up, to receive the second layer in\r\nreversed position, making a method for conveying the lye into\r\nreservoirs, whence it was pumped out to the crystallization troughs. Dr.\r\nCall was the first to direct attention to this ingenious device.\r\n\r\nAgain we forsake the Main Cave for a ramble through Gothic Avenue, which\r\nis reached by a stairway just beyond the vats. At the entrance to it is\r\nBooth’s Amphitheatre, where Edwin Booth is said to have recited a part\r\nof the play of Hamlet. In early times a mummy was found in an adjoining\r\ncave, and brought hither for exhibition. The alcove where it reposed\r\nstill bears the name of the Mummy’s Niche. It was afterward carried\r\nabout through the West on exhibition, and it was the writer’s privilege\r\nto see it at that time. It was naturally dessicated, and with its\r\nornaments and garments was regarded as a great curiosity. It remained in\r\na museum at Worcester, Mass., for many years, and is now in the National\r\nMuseum at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nHundreds of visitors have recorded their names in Register Hall, either\r\nby scratching them on the wall with the knife or smoking them there by\r\ntheir candles, or else by the less conspicuous way of depositing their\r\ncards on the ledge set apart for that purpose. Here, and also in parts\r\nof the Main Cave, so-called “monuments” are built by piling up flat\r\nfragments of stone in honor of individuals, States, or benevolent\r\norganizations; a practice which incidentally has helped to clear\r\nobstructions from the pathway in which we walk. The largest of them all\r\nis quite properly the Kentucky Monument. The effect in general, however,\r\nis to divert attention from the natural attractions.\r\n\r\nThe hoary old stalactites, great and small, in Gothic Avenue got their\r\ngrowth ages ago. The signs show that long ago the Cave stream was\r\ndiverted to lower channels, leaving the place as dry as a tinder-box.\r\nThe Post-Oak Pillar, the Pillars of Hercules, Pompey and Cæsar, and the\r\nAltar in Gothic Chapel, are interesting and picturesque, and give the\r\nguides occasion for many legends and jokes; but do not warrant the\r\nconclusions drawn by Dr. Binkerd and others as to the age of the Mammoth\r\nCave, judging by the alleged slow growth of dripstone in a locality\r\nwhere there is now no growth at all. There is no doubt as to the vast\r\nantiquity of the great cavern, whose remote origin is by many referred\r\nto the Tertiary Period; but it must be remembered that geological\r\nchanges are by no means uniform, and that catastrophe has evidently\r\nplayed a conspicuous part in cave-making.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough moisture now in Gothic Avenue to make the atoms\r\nfloat in the air. Toss a handful of dust up, and it falls back like so\r\nmuch shot. I saw a party of young people who came here directly from the\r\nballroom, and not a particle of dust spotted the trailing robes or clung\r\nto the polished boots. Wood here undergoes tardy decay, and fresh beef\r\nand other meats keep sweet for a long time, and then dry up like the old\r\nmummy which was mentioned as having once been placed here.\r\n\r\nPompey Pillar is named for a negro miner, a raw hand, who in old times\r\ntrudged in here alone for “peter-dirt” and lost his way. He stumbled,\r\nput out his lamp, and was in a frenzy. When at last he saw his\r\nhalf-naked negro comrades approach, swinging their torches and shouting,\r\nhe took them for demons, and shouted lustily for mercy. It took no\r\nlittle shaking and punching to convince him that he was yet alive and in\r\nMammoth Cave, instead of elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt may tax the imagination to find the resemblance to an Elephant’s Head\r\nin the stalactite so called; but once found the grotesque likeness is\r\nvivid.\r\n\r\nA curious legend told of the Gothic Chapel and its Bridal Altar is\r\nverified. A Kentucky belle gave her heart to a gallant Southron. But her\r\nmother, who opposed the match, made her swear never to marry any man on\r\nthe face of the earth. Shortly the lovers eloped and were hotly pursued;\r\nbut before they were caught they were married in this novel Gretna\r\nGreen. Taxed with her broken pledge, the bride replied: “Mother, dear,\r\nit was not marrying any man ‘on the face of the earth’ to wed my own\r\ntrue love in this underground chapel.”\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Marriage in “Gothic Chapel”]\r\n\r\nFew ladies fail to rest awhile in the Old Arm Chair, a stalagmite\r\nnaturally fitted as a seat. Jenny Lind sat here and sang one of her\r\nsweet songs; and many a song has been sung here since. A slender\r\nprojection beyond it is called the Lover’s Leap, from whose point an\r\nillumination shows a wild mass of rocks amid which runs a narrow path\r\nstyled the Elbow Crevice, whose walls are fantastically folded. We\r\nescape from the ragged edge of what is known as Joseph’s Pit, and note\r\nin passing the Devil’s Cooling Tub. Gatewood’s Dining-Table is a huge\r\nflat rock directly under Napoleon’s Dome, from whose apex it fell.\r\n\r\nGratz Avenue, into which we enter, is not on the same Cave level as the\r\nGothic Avenue. Unless we take care we may walk directly into the\r\nexquisitely clear waters of Lake Purity, a small mirror-like pool.\r\nBeyond it we go, winding to and fro, till at the foot of a small cliff\r\nwe find the entrance to Annette’s Dome, one of the prettiest in all the\r\nCave. Shaler’s Brook spouts from the wall and runs merrily and musically\r\ninto a smaller room, whence it vanishes, falling by a leap of seventy\r\nfeet into Lee’s Cistern. In Gratz Avenue are found blind crustaceans,\r\ncrickets, and other forms of life described by Dr. Call.\r\n\r\nWe now retrace our way to the Main Cave, passing various objects noticed\r\nin the first route. Shortly beyond the Giant’s Coffin the Main Cave\r\nturns suddenly to the left at the Acute Angle, where the burning\r\nmagnesium makes visible the vast dimensions of the cavern by\r\nilluminating it in two directions at once. A village in the vicinity\r\nformerly sheltered a colony of consumptives who, in 1843, and by medical\r\nadvice, took up their abode here, hopeful for relief or cure because of\r\nthe uniform temperature and the naturally oxygenated air. The sunless\r\ndays passed slowly by till the pitiful experiment was abandoned as a\r\nfailure, as was also the experiment by the invalids to make trees and\r\nshrubbery grow around their dismal huts. Some of the victims of the\r\n“white plague” lie buried in the grove back of the Hotel garden, while\r\nothers died soon after returning to their homes. There were originally\r\nthirteen cottages and tents, the only ones now remaining being two\r\nroofless stone structures beyond the Acute Angle.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: “Old Arm Chair”]\r\n\r\nA strangely beautiful transformation scene is wrought for us in the Star\r\nChamber, a hall seventy feet wide, sixty feet high, and several hundred\r\nfeet long. The ceiling is coated with manganese dioxide, and through\r\nthis black background emerge hundreds of brilliant white stars, made by\r\nthe efflorescence of the sulphate of magnesia. These are invisible at\r\nfirst, and the magnificent archway sweeps above us in midnight\r\nblackness. Long benches are ranged against the right-hand wall, on which\r\nthe guide seats us, while he collects our lamps and vanishes with them\r\nbehind a jutting rock. Then comes the marvelous illusion. The roof seems\r\nlifted to an immense height. Indeed, we seem to gaze from a cañon\r\ndirectly up to the starry sky. Cloud-shadows are thrown athwart it by\r\nadroit manipulation. A meteor shoots across the vault. We behold the\r\nmild glory of the Milky Way. Suddenly the guide breaks in upon our\r\nexclamations of delight by saying, “Good night. I will see you again in\r\nthe morning!” He plunges into a gorge. We are in utter darkness. The\r\nsilence is so perfect that we can hear our hearts beat. Presently a\r\nglimmer comes from another direction, like a faint streak of dawn. The\r\naurora tinges the tips of the rocks; the horizon is bathed in a rosy\r\nglow; a concert of cock-crowing, the lowing of cattle and other barnyard\r\nsounds, answered by the barking of the house-dog, seem to herald the\r\nrising sun; when the ventriloquial guide appears, swinging his cluster\r\nof lamps and asking how we liked the performance. Our response is a\r\nhearty encore; after granting which the guide tells us that the second\r\nroute ends here, and he must pilot us back to the mouth of the Cave and\r\nto the Hotel. Those who have witnessed the wonders of the Star Chamber\r\nmany times testify that the charm never wanes.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: “The Acute Angle”]\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration:       COPYRIGHT 1908 BY H.

We find the natural\r\ntimepiece to be but the dripping of water into a small basin hidden\r\nbehind some rocks. The drops fall only a few inches, one by one, as they\r\nmay have fallen for a thousand years; but such are the acoustic\r\nproperties of the place that the musical ticking is heard for a long\r\ndistance. The guide shows us also another pretty pool, made by a tiny\r\nrill gushing from the solid wall; and he tells us the story of a\r\nrambling blind boy, who won a living by his violin, and who said that he\r\n“wanted to _see_ the Cave” for himself. Somehow he got apart from his\r\ncompanions, and when they found the little boy he was sound asleep\r\nbeside this tiny basin, which has ever since been known as “Wandering\r\nWillie’s Spring.”\r\n\r\nHastening on to the Star Chamber, we resume our exploration of the Main\r\nCave. Beyond that hall of constellations, the Grand Gallery—as it used\r\nto be called—sweeps to the right, and the starry canopy changes to a\r\n“mackerel-sky,” caused by the scaling-off of the black deposit on the\r\nceiling, thus exposing the white limestone. This is the Floating Cloud\r\nRoom. As we look aloft at the fleecy masses that seem to float along, we\r\nnotice a stout oak pole jutting from an inaccessible crevice. When, why,\r\nhow, and by whom was it put there? In Lee’s “Notes of the Mammoth Cave,”\r\nin 1835, ancient fireplaces are mentioned, which were also shown to\r\nmyself by old Matt, in 1881, and which were hidden by broad slabs along\r\nthe margin of the Cave.\r\n\r\nCurious objects are pointed out as we walk through Procter’s Arcade and\r\nKinney’s Arena, lofty and symmetrical enlargements of the passageway.\r\nOne of them is another stout pole in a rift in the roof. The Keel-Boat\r\n(or the Whale) is an enormous rock seventy feet long, and a tilted slab\r\nof limestone is the Devil’s Looking-Glass. Presently it begins to snow;\r\nand our shouts make the flakes fall faster. Waving lamps and lighted\r\nfire-balls augment the storm. Seeking an explanation, we find that the\r\nceiling is crusted with native Epsom salts, whose crystals are thus\r\ndislodged, as well as more silently by the growth of new crystals,\r\nfalling, as saline snow till the brown ledges are whitened by mimic\r\nsnowdrifts.\r\n\r\nNo stooping or crawling has to be done in the Main Cave, and the floor\r\nis everywhere dry. Formerly the tilting slabs of limestone made walking\r\ndifficult, but now these are removed so as to give us a fairly smooth\r\nroad throughout. The serpentine winding known as the S-bend expands to a\r\nwidth of one hundred and seventy-five feet and keeps that width for five\r\nhundred and fifty feet; but midway it meets a grand crossing, that\r\nincreases the width to about four hundred feet. Fox Avenue, near by,\r\nencloses a large cave-island.\r\n\r\nDr. Nahum Ward and other early explorers fancied the Main Cave as\r\nformerly an underground Nile, and its rocky masses ruined cities; and on\r\nthe first maps they were numbered First, Second, Third, Fourth, and\r\nFifth City. The first in order was called the Chief City, while the\r\nfourth, now familiar to us by that name, was the Temple. This fact\r\nexplains some conflicting accounts by early and more recent authors.\r\nRobert M. Bird was responsible for these changes, giving the name of\r\nWright’s Rotunda to the First City in honor of his friend, Prof. C. A.\r\nWright, M. D.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most spacious rooms in the Cave, being shaped like\r\nthe letter T, its length about five hundred feet and its width at the\r\ntransept about three hundred and fifty feet. The ceiling is quite level\r\nthroughout, but the floor is irregular, causing the space between roof\r\nand floor to vary from ten to forty-five feet. When several chemical\r\nfires are ignited at distant points simultaneously the effect is superb.\r\nRagged cliffs divide this prodigious area, making a sort of great\r\nisland, beyond which by climbing through the so-called Chimneys those\r\nwho wish can reach the Black Chambers above, extending for several\r\nhundred feet. The walls and domes of these chambers are coated with the\r\nblack oxide of manganese, and the enormous rocks lie scattered in the\r\nwildest disorder.\r\n\r\nReturning to Wright’s Rotunda and taking the other arm of the T, we\r\npresently find ourselves looking directly into a steep hollow, or pit,\r\ninto which the Cataracts tumble from orifices in the roof, and with\r\nresounding force after a rainfall. Those who risk a descent part way\r\ndown the pit and climb over a wall may find their way into the Solitary\r\nChambers and the Fairy Grotto, though the difficulty of access prevents\r\nthese places from being ordinarily exhibited. A “tumble-down” to the\r\nleft of the Cataract chasm might correctly be regarded as the\r\ntermination of the Main Cave.\r\n\r\nA passage to the left opens from Cataract Hall to a lofty avenue\r\ncommonly spoken of as a continuation of the Main Cave, but really on\r\nanother level. The limestone slabs that used to clatter under our feet\r\nand endanger our equilibrium have been made firm or else removed, and we\r\neasily proceed through the Gorge and across the portal of what once was\r\nstyled the Temple, but has long been known as the Chief City.\r\n\r\nBy my measurement the room is four hundred and fifty feet long, with an\r\naverage width of one hundred and seventy-five feet; but others have made\r\nthe dimensions larger. The utmost height does not exceed one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet. The maximum width, as measured by Dr. Call, is two\r\nhundred and eighty-seven feet. The area covers about two acres. And over\r\nthis vast space springs a solid and seamless canopy of gray limestone,\r\nthat has thus lifted its majestic arch for thousands of years. Dr. Bird\r\nfound here, in 1837, aboriginal relics “in astonishing, unaccountable\r\nquantities.” Formerly these were heaped as bonfires to illuminate the\r\nchamber; but even yet cartloads remain of half-burnt cane-torches,\r\nfragments of woven moccasins, and other objects of interest, to reward\r\nsearch amid crevices and crannies. The theory is that the Indians made\r\nthis place their council chamber, or else their stronghold of refuge\r\nfrom enemies.\r\n\r\nFascinated with the local attractions and possibly too forgetful of the\r\nweariness of my guide, I lingered once till midnight, prowling amid the\r\nfastnesses of the Chief City. Noticing presently the utter silence that\r\nprevailed, I returned to where my guide had been left on guard, only to\r\nfind a couple of lamps and a strip of brown paper on which he had\r\nscrawled the words, “It is midnight and I got tired and went out.” The\r\nguide had really deserted me, and the only thing to do was to await the\r\ncoming of comrades, who would surely hunt me up, as they did after the\r\nlapse of an hour or so. Extinguishing the lamps meanwhile, fancy was\r\ngiven full play to people the mysterious council chamber with ghosts of\r\ndusky warriors, till there seemed to be a rush of whispers and other\r\nimaginary sounds that were really caused, I suppose, by the coursing of\r\nthe blood through my veins. It was easy to realize that a person\r\nactually lost in Mammoth Cave might soon be so bewildered as to lose his\r\nreason. Even in my own case it was a relief to break the spell, as I\r\ndid, by simply striking a match and trimming anew the flickering flame\r\nof my lamps. Every observant visitor has seen with pleasure the\r\nassemblage of rocks and the overarching canopy aglow with Bengal lights\r\nor burning magnesium, and has commented on the singular fact that the\r\nlofty dome seems to follow him as he retires from its protection.\r\n\r\nSt. Catherine City, which lies beyond, is at the intersection of the\r\nBlue Spring Branch and Blackall Avenue with the main passageway. The\r\nlatter, recently named in honor of the veteran cave-hunter, Dr. C. R.\r\nBlackall, of Philadelphia, ends in a funnel-shaped pit bearing the name\r\nof Symmes’ Pit, probably in memory of Captain John Cleves Symmes, of\r\nNewport, Kentucky, whose theory gained much attention formerly—that our\r\nglobe was a hollow sphere with an opening at the poles, and that within\r\nwere races of men and animals different from those on the surface. At a\r\npublic meeting held at Frankfort, a resolution was adopted to the effect\r\nthat the United States Congress should fit out an expedition to the\r\nArctic Circle under his command, in order to find, if possible, the\r\nmysterious Polar pit for which this Cave pit was named.\r\n\r\nOur course, however, leads us to Waldach’s Dome (in memory of Charles\r\nWaldach, the pioneer in cave-photography) and Hains’ Dome (in honor of\r\nhis successor, Ben Hains), both of them symmetrical and noble domes,\r\nrising to oval ceilings above smooth floors of sand. In the Garret we\r\nfind flakes of Epsom salts like those found in the Snow Room. Bending\r\nlow through Mayme’s Stoopway, we reach what to Dr. Call and myself\r\nseemed to be an impenetrable wall, to which we gave what we thought the\r\nfitting name of “Ultima Thule.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1908 Mr. Max Kaemper, of Germany, undertook a complete\r\nexploration of Mammoth Cave, assisted by Edward Bishop, guide, the\r\nresults of which are exclusively for the owners of the Cave. Their\r\nobservations led them to suspect that a certain tumble-down in the\r\nSandstone Avenue might be identical with the tumble-down known as Ultima\r\nThule. Hence they attacked a crawl-way near the latter, and by patiently\r\nremoving many limestone fragments they wormed their way through to an\r\noval hall, one hundred and sixty feet long by one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet wide and sixty feet high, now named, for its discoverer, Kaemper\r\nHall. An unseen waterfall, by whose music they had been led onward, was\r\nnow seen to dash down an abyss they named, for the guide, Bishop’s Pit.\r\nAnother is the “Parrish Pit,” so called for Norman A. Parrish, of\r\nBuffalo, New York. These are the first of a series of eleven pits, the\r\nothers not yet being named.\r\n\r\nFifty steps to the right is a short passage where an iron gate is now\r\nfixed, opening into a symmetrical chamber seventy-five feet in diameter\r\nand of about the same height, rising by vaulted arches and closing above\r\nin a beautiful circle. This is Elizabeth’s Dome, named for a sister of\r\nMr. Kaemper. The exit is by the Grand Portal, an arch sixty feet wide\r\nand fifty feet high, commanding one of the most magnificent views in all\r\nthe underground world.\r\n\r\nOn visiting the locality soon after its discovery, I seated myself on\r\nAlbert’s Stairway, while one of my companions ignited Bengal lights here\r\nand there, and the other used an automobile searchlight brought in for\r\nthe purpose; and thus they gave me my first view of the wonderful\r\nregion, to which the general name of Violet City is given, in honor of\r\nMrs. Violet Blair Janin, the wife of Trustee Albert C. Janin, and the\r\nfair owner of one third of the Mammoth Cave estate. Special features are\r\nBlair Castle and the Marble Temple, whose environs are styled\r\n“Walhalla,” for the fabled realm above the clouds where dwell the heroes\r\nand demigods of old German mythology.\r\n\r\nPicking up our torches again, and carrying my acetylene bicycle lamp, to\r\nwhich I had fixed a convenient handle, we followed a natural pathway\r\nnear the wall on the left, that led us from place to place. We found\r\nthat Violet City is two hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five wide, rivaled only in size by Wright’s Rotunda and the Chief\r\nCity, and greatly exceeding them in beauty. A sandstone cave-in at the\r\nend seems to lend color to the idea that Sandstone Avenue, or some\r\nsimilar place, is near. These fallen blocks are cemented together by a\r\nprofusion of onyx. Stalactites and stalagmites abound everywhere,\r\nvarying in color from the purest white alabaster through every\r\nimaginable shade. The upper central part of the hall is crowned by three\r\nmasses of fluted white onyx, glistening with exquisite crystals, while\r\nfrom the roof hang in fine array stalactites eight or ten feet long. The\r\nright wall is decorated with pure white formations, and the left wall is\r\ncoated with rich brown onyx. A row of stalactites of varying length emit\r\nmusical tones when struck by the knuckles, and by skillful percussion\r\nsimple airs can be played on them. These are the Chimes.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: The Chimes]\r\n\r\nOther attractions excite surprise. The Beer Mug, like a mug of foaming\r\nale, the Ripe Tomato, a rare bit of red onyx, and other odd specimens of\r\nnatural mimicry are here. One familiar with the brilliant creations\r\nfound in the wonderful caverns of Luray might easily imagine himself in\r\nthat Virginian fairyland instead of in Mammoth Cave. Thus far these\r\nmarvelous treasures have been kept untouched by vandal fingers, such as\r\nhave robbed or destroyed elsewhere what should have been most jealously\r\nguarded in the greatest cavern known.\r\n\r\nIn his zeal to open a passage from Violet City to Sandstone Avenue Mr.\r\nKaemper obtained permission to use explosives. Thus he made considerable\r\nprogress. However, the indications were that he was likely to burst\r\nthrough to the surface somewhere, instead of into Sandstone Avenue, and\r\naccordingly he desisted. In either case the result might have been\r\nadvantageous. An opening into Sandstone Avenue would enable visitors to\r\nmake the circuit through the Main Cave and Violet City, and return by\r\nthe Long Route, without having to retrace their steps. On the other\r\nhand, an exit to the surface from near Violet City would enable them to\r\nreturn by coach to the Cave Hotel without a wearisome tramp over ground\r\nalready trodden.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: The Marble Temple]\r\n\r\nTo convince those who, like the writer, are skeptical as to the\r\nproximity of Violet City and Sandstone Avenue, Kaemper and Bishop\r\nrepaired, one to the first place and the other to the second, agreeing\r\non a fixed moment by the watch when they would fire revolvers and\r\nlikewise hammer on the rocks. The pistol shots were inaudible, but the\r\nblows on the walls were faintly heard. By similar sound-tests it was\r\ndetermined that Wright’s Rotunda is directly above the Serpent Hall\r\n(beyond Echo River), so that it might be possible to connect them by a\r\nstairway through an artificial shaft. Incidentally I may state, however,\r\nas showing how far sound may travel through the rocks and their\r\nmysterious crevices, that, while in the Chief City, we heard the\r\nsteam-cars running over the Mammoth Cave Railroad.\r\n\r\nBut now no short cut is provided for us, and we return as we came,\r\ncarrying with us delightful memories of the New Discovery.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: William Garvin, the Guide]\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: In “Violet City”]\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration:      DRAWN AND COPYRIGHTED BY\r\n                                                        H.C.

The trip is varied by the boat-ride, the midday\r\nlunch, and the occasional stops at points of interest. The spirits are\r\nalso sustained by the exhilarating Cave atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine ourselves, therefore, as having landed at Rocky Inlet, on\r\nthe farther shore of the wonderful Echo River. Soon we are greeted by\r\nthe music of the waterfall in Cascade Hall. To our right are\r\nStephenson’s Avenue, whose principal attraction is Neptune’s Cups, and\r\nthe Aquarius Avenue, leading to Roaring River; both of which offer\r\nmatters of interest to the scientist, but are never visited by ordinary\r\ntourists, who hasten on to other scenes more accessible. Wellington’s\r\nGalleries are peculiar shelf-like projections. At Dripping Spring we\r\nfind a few stalactites. We pass in safety what the guides irreverently\r\nname the Infernal Regions, Pluto’s Dome, and Old Scratch Hall—the latter\r\nbeing surprisingly scratched all over, while the only trails of serpents\r\nin Serpent Hall are the freaks of nature observed as winding channels\r\noverhead. The fact should be noted that this is high-water mark for Echo\r\nRiver in time of flood. Hence we take particular interest in the opening\r\nfrom Serpent Hall to Ganter Avenue as our only exit at such times,\r\nrunning as it does for eight thousand five hundred feet to the Wooden\r\nBowl Room, near the Giant’s Coffin in the Main Cave. We are assured,\r\nhowever, that visitors are seldom so unlucky as to get caught by such a\r\nsudden rise of the waters. We have now entered Silliman’s Avenue, named\r\nfor the late Professor Silliman of Yale University. In the Valley-Way\r\nSide-Cut are singular crystals of gypsum that grow in the ground, whence\r\nthey are dug up, like so many potatoes. Beyond the Hill of Fatigue\r\nstands the Great Western, resembling an ocean steamer, her helm\r\nhard-a-port. By mounting a ledge between the Vale of Flowers and Rabbit\r\nRock, and following Rhoda Arcade for about five hundred yards amid\r\ninteresting incrustations, we find three domes, named for different\r\nmembers of the Jesup family, the highest and most symmetrical being\r\nLucy’s Dome, connected by a lofty archway with the other two. Immense\r\nalabaster curtains hang on the walls, and the effect when illuminated\r\nfrom the archway is grand.\r\n\r\nOn the left of Silliman’s Avenue is a hall with fine acoustic\r\nproperties, thirty feet wide, forty long, and twenty high, where the\r\nfamous Norwegian violinist Ole Bull is said to have once given a special\r\nperformance; and hence it bears his name, Ole Bull’s Concert Hall. The\r\nwild and rugged pass which, on the map, seems to be a continuance of\r\nSilliman’s Avenue, is really on a lower level, and is well named “El\r\nGhor” (The Gorge). It winds about like a forsaken river bed, which it\r\nundoubtedly is, and offers many surprising sights. One such is the Fly\r\nChamber, in which swarms of house-flies seem to have settled on the\r\nwalls and ceiling. Examination proves them to be so many crystals of\r\nblack oxide of manganese. The Hanging Rocks, the Sheep-shelter, and the\r\nVictoria Crown are formations whose names suggest their shape.\r\nImmediately over El Ghor is Corinne’s Dome, nine feet wide and about\r\nforty feet high. The guide points out what he styles Suicide Rock, and\r\nwhen you innocently ask him “Why?” his ready reply is, “Because it hung\r\nitself.” The Black Hole of Calcutta is an ugly black pit on the left of\r\nthe pass. El Ghor continues on for some distance, but we leave it after\r\nrefreshing ourselves at Hebe’s Spring, a clear pool four feet in\r\ndiameter by a foot and a half deep, and said to be impregnated with\r\nsulphur; a fact of interest—it might easily come from the reduction of\r\ngypsum or Epsom salt.\r\n\r\nStevenson, who was here in 1861, says, “There is a short avenue, or\r\nrather a hole, leading from El Ghor to a sheet of water called Mystic\r\nRiver, which has not been explored, as they have never been able to get\r\na boat in there.” Other early writers mention Mystic River, but Dr. Call\r\nand myself were unable to find it. Possibly it is identical with the\r\nstream in Martel Avenue; but no one would ever think of a “boat” in\r\nconnection with the latter.\r\n\r\nBoone Avenue, diverging from El Ghor to our left at a point five\r\nthousand eight hundred and twenty yards from the mouth of the Cave, was\r\nfor many years blocked by a stone stairway, recently removed. Important\r\ndiscoveries were made in this direction in 1907, to which we shall\r\npresently give attention.\r\n\r\nNow, however, we climb up through an uninviting hole at our right that\r\nadmits us to an upper tier of caverns. When the last man is through we\r\nburn blue fire, and are surprised to find ourselves in a stone vineyard.\r\nNodules and globules simulate clusters on clusters of luscious grapes,\r\ngleaming with parti-colored tints through dripping dew. No covetous hand\r\nis allowed to pluck the marvelous vintage of Mary’s Vineyard; which,\r\nafter all, the mineralogist explains as simply calcium carbonate coated\r\nwith the black oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nWashington Hall, smoke-stained and its floor strewn with relics of\r\nhundreds of lunch-parties in former days, is mainly interesting as the\r\nplace whence two grand avenues diverge, namely, Marion Avenue, not\r\nincluded in our route, and Cleaveland Avenue, so named for the late\r\nmineralogist of that name. This avenue is one of the great “lions” of\r\nMammoth Cave, and many think more of it than of all the other Cave lions\r\nput together. It has indeed a marvelous beauty peculiarly its own. Walls\r\nand ceiling everywhere are decorated by mimic leaves and flowers, in an\r\ninfinite variety of form. There is hardly a plant known to botany that\r\ndoes not find its counterpart here; but roses, camellias, and\r\nchrysanthemums are the most common varieties. In many parts of this\r\ntreasury of crystals there is not a space as large as your hand that is\r\nnot decorated by dazzling blossoms; and even the floor sparkles with\r\nbright fragments of flowers demolished by vandal visitors. Dr. John\r\nLocke, of Cincinnati, gave these Cave rosettes the name of\r\n“oulopholites,” meaning literally “curled-leaf-stones.” Among\r\ndescriptive names assigned to different parts of this enchanted realm\r\nare Snowball Room, Flora’s Garden, Orpha’s Garden, the Cross of Flowers,\r\nthe Last Rose of Summer, Crypt of Jewels, and Charlotte’s Grotto. These\r\nare not all of them in Cleaveland Avenue, but some are in its vicinity.\r\nIt is a vast crystalline region, through which one may wander for fully\r\ntwo miles and occasionally find, in some secluded nook, the trailing\r\nvines, stalks of celery, and stag’s antlers described by early tourists.\r\n\r\nSurfeited at length by such floral splendors, we suddenly emerge into\r\nCall’s Rotunda and clamber up the loosely piled blocks of limestone\r\ncalled the Rocky Mountains, from whose summit we look down into the\r\nDismal Hollow, whose gloom our red fires hardly succeed in dispelling.\r\nThree avenues branch from Call’s Rotunda; one to Sandstone Avenue, which\r\nKaemper considers to be in proximity to Violet City; another, Franklin\r\nAvenue, ends in Serena’s Arbor; and the third leads directly to a large\r\nroom named, for the former owner of the Cave, Croghan’s Hall. It is\r\nsixty feet in diameter and thirty feet high. Here we find, the yawning\r\nchasm known as the Maelström, which by my measurement is eighty-eight\r\nfeet deep, though often described as far deeper than that. It is claimed\r\nthat W. C. Prentice was the first to descend to the bottom of this\r\nabyss. According to Mr. Procter the same feat was afterward accomplished\r\nby Mr. Richard Babbitt. Mr. F. J. Stevenson, of London, in his letters\r\nto his mother, tells the story at great length of his own descent into\r\nthe Maelström in the presence of thirty witnesses and with the help of\r\ntwo guides, Nicholas Branford and Frank de Monbrun. On the 15th of May,\r\n1905, Mr. Benjamin F. Einbigler and John M. Nelson, guide, were lowered\r\nby ropes held by Edward Hawkins and Levi Woodson, guides, the\r\nrope-length being exactly ninety-seven feet eight inches. Their account\r\ndiffers materially from the former descriptions, but we will not try to\r\nadjust their statements in this manual. The most that the visitor will\r\nbe apt to do will be to peer over the brink and wonder that anybody\r\nshould venture down such an awful abyss. This is estimated to be\r\nninety-six hundred yards from the entrance to the Cave, and is often\r\nspoken of as “the end of Mammoth Cave.” But who can tell where the real\r\n“end” of so vast a labyrinth may be? At any rate here we turn and\r\nretrace our steps through the paradise of Cave flowers until we reach\r\nMary’s Vineyard and descend to the level of El Ghor.\r\n\r\nHere, if we have the time, strength, and inclination, we may enter Boone\r\nAvenue, which has been known for many years, and visit what is\r\npractically a new part, of the Cave, though there are signs of its\r\nhaving been explored long ago by unknown visitors.\r\n\r\nA well-worn path leads us to a chasm, down whose slope we pick our way\r\nto a lower level known on Stephen Bishop’s old map as Miriam Avenue. A\r\nnarrow and winding way, called Pinson’s Pass, leads into a long and\r\nnoble avenue which is named Martel Avenue, in honor of the famous\r\ncave-hunter of France, Edward A. Martel. The point where we enter it is\r\ncalled, from its peculiar shape, Bottle Hall. Were we to go to the left\r\nin Martel Avenue we should find the path rugged and difficult, but would\r\nbe rewarded by seeing Helictite Hall, where abound those curious twisted\r\nand distorted stalactites known as helictites. Several small passages\r\nbranch off from the avenue, which finally terminates in Galloway’s Dome.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand portion of Martel Avenue brings us soon to the bed of a\r\nbrook that must at times be deeply covered by flowing water. Ripple\r\nmarks of sand alternate with flat masses of jet-black polished flint.\r\nKnots of wood, roots of corn-stalks, and other objects indicate that\r\nthey were recently swept down hither from the surface. Two adjacent\r\ndomes are named for the intrepid guide, John M. Nelson, but beyond them\r\nsome hardy pioneer had inscribed on a rock the date 1848. Mr. Norman A.\r\nParrish came as far as this in 1904, but the distinction of availing\r\nhimself of footholds over a risky limestone slip and crossing where\r\nothers had turned back belongs to Mr. B. F. Einbigler, already mentioned\r\nas having descended the Maelström. For him the great overhanging dome is\r\nnamed, while a still grander one about a hundred yards beyond was named\r\nby him “Edna Dome” for his sister, who subsequently visited it. Instead\r\nof narrowing to an apex, as most domes do, Edna Dome broadens at the\r\ntop, seeming to open into a cross-cavern. This conjecture remains to be\r\nverified by some climber.\r\n\r\nEdward Hawkins scaled the wall of the pit underneath Einbigler’s Dome,\r\nMay 15, 1907, being followed by Einbigler, Bransford, and at another\r\nvisit by Mr. H. M. Pinson, who took along the head-light of an\r\nautomobile for illumination. This searchlight was still there on the\r\noccasion of my own visit, on the 18th of June, 1907, a month afterward,\r\nin company with William Bransford and Frank Barry, guides. Passing\r\nthrough Hawkins’ Way and scaling a wall at its end, we were on the level\r\nfloor of a dome sixty feet in diameter and from one hundred and fifty to\r\ntwo hundred feet high. A tall arched gateway opened from this into a\r\nsecond dome of equal size; and through similar gateways we entered in\r\nsuccession five vast domes arranged as a sigmoidal group. From the fifth\r\na window opens into an irregular room, where a downfall of rocks blocks\r\nfurther progress. In this fifth dome also a waterfall leaps from the\r\napex to the floor, where it vanishes into a chasm. The majestic walls\r\nrise in horizontal tiers, each tier about ten feet in thickness and\r\nfringed by beautiful stalactites. The mighty masonry ascends in\r\nnarrowing circles till the powerful searchlight barely enables us to\r\ndiscern the oval white tablet forming the apex, girt by onyx pendants.\r\nVertically the walls are richly corrugated from top to bottom. The\r\nentire series of five united domes is four times the magnitude of\r\nGorin’s Dome. Ages on ages were needed for the chemical and mechanical\r\naction whereby this surprising cathedral was carved in silence broken\r\nonly by the wild, pattering waterfall or the heavier cataract. Let me\r\nanew express my obligation to the Mammoth Cave management for having\r\nmarked their appreciation of my long-continued and enthusiastic interest\r\nin their wonderful cavern by naming, with the approval of the discoverer\r\nand the guides, this remarkable group of domes “Hovey’s Cathedral.”\r\n\r\nA glance at the map will show, that Kaemper and Bishop went beyond what\r\nhas just been described, and found two domes, to one of which Mr.\r\nKaemper gave the name of a German lady, calling it “Gerta’s Grotto,” and\r\nthe other he named “Creighton’s Dome,” for an early and otherwise\r\nunknown explorer, whose footprints were found there, and who left his\r\nname carved on the rocks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let it again be stated that the aim of this hand-book is\r\nmainly to help the visitor to understand those routes over which guides\r\nordinarily conduct parties. The known avenues and minor passageways, if\r\nplaced end to end, would exceed one hundred and fifty miles by a\r\nconservative estimate. Sixty-nine pits and thirty-nine domes, counting\r\nonly those of great magnitude, are known and located on the surveys of\r\n1908, besides many lateral enlargements, after the style of Wright’s\r\nRotunda and the Chief City. Yet we dare not say that this immense cavern\r\nhas been completely explored. Those most familiar with its surprising\r\ndimensions think it possible that resolute men, beginning where others\r\nhave left off, might find as much more new territory as has already been\r\ndescribed in the vast subterranean realm known as the Mammoth Cave of\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained the original, inconsistent spellings “Jesup” and “Jessup”.\r\n\r\n—Retained copyright notices, although this eBook is public-domain in the\r\n  country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
