For twelve years\r\nit had been my business, as Secretary to the Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Medicine by Research, to know something about\r\nexperiments on animals, and to follow the working of the Act of 1876;\r\nand to give facts and references to a very large number of applicants.\r\nBelieving that an account of these experiments, and of the conditions\r\nimposed on them by the Act, might serve a useful purpose, I proposed\r\nto the Council of the Association that I should write a book on the\r\nsubject. The Council accepted this proposal; and decided that the book\r\nshould be written for general reading, that it should not be\r\nanonymous, and that it should be published without reserve.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, a doubtful and embarrassing task. But, from twelve\r\nyears' experience of the things said by the chief opponents of all\r\nexperiments on animals, I knew that there was only one way of doing\r\nit--to give the original authorities, the plain facts, the very words,\r\nchapter and verse for everything.\r\n\r\nAmong those who kindly revised the proofs were Prof. Rose Bradford and\r\nProf. Starling, who revised Part I.; Mr. Shattock, who revised Part\r\nII.; and Prof. Schäfer. Valuable help was given by Mr. R. H. Clarke,\r\nSir Victor Horsley, Dr. Beevor, Prof. Ronald Ross, and the late Dr.\r\nWashbourn; and I was allowed to make free use of Mr. George Pernet's\r\ncareful researches into the history of the subject. Lord Lister\r\nhimself did me the honour to read and correct, with the utmost\r\npatience, Parts I. and II.\r\n\r\nIn the second edition (1904) some mistakes were corrected, and some\r\nfacts were added.\r\n\r\nThe present edition has been thoroughly revised; and I have included\r\nin it a reprint, with some changes and omissions, of a pamphlet, _The\r\nCase against Anti-vivisection_, which I wrote in 1904.\r\n\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work by Mr. Paget is entirely a labour of love. Not being himself\r\nengaged in researches involving experiments upon the lower animals, he\r\nis not directly interested in the subject. But, in his official\r\ncapacity as Secretary (1887-1899) to the Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Medicine by Research, he has become widely conversant\r\nwith such investigations, and has been deeply impressed with the\r\ngreatness of the benefits which they have conferred upon mankind, and\r\nthe grievous mistake that is made by those who desire to suppress\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe action of these well-meaning persons is based upon ignorance. They\r\nallow that man is permitted to inflict pain upon the lower animals\r\nwhen some substantial advantage is to be gained; but they deny that\r\nany good has ever resulted from the researches which they condemn.\r\n\r\nHow far such statements are from the truth will be evident to those\r\nwho peruse this book. Its earlier pages deal with Physiology, the main\r\nbasis of all sound medicine and surgery. The examples given in this\r\ndepartment are not numerous; they are, however, sufficiently striking,\r\nas indications that, from the discovery of the circulation of the\r\nblood onwards, our knowledge of healthy animal function has been\r\nmainly derived from experiments on animals.\r\n\r\nThe chief bulk of the work is devoted to the class of investigations\r\nwhich are most frequent at the present day; and it shows what a flood\r\nof light has been already thrown by Bacteriology upon the nature of\r\nhuman disease and the means of combating it.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the Action of Drugs will be to many a startling\r\ndisclosure of the gross ignorance that prevailed among physicians even\r\nin the earlier part of last century. The great revolution that has\r\nsince taken place is no doubt largely due to advances in sciences\r\nother than Biology, especially Chemistry. But it could not have\r\nattained its present proportions without the ever-increasing knowledge\r\nof Physiology, based on experiments on animals; and Mr. Paget shows\r\nhow large a share these have had in the direct investigation of\r\narticles of the Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nThe concluding part of the volume discusses the restrictions which\r\nhave been placed by the legislature in this country on those engaged\r\nin these researches, with the view of obviating possible abuse.\r\nWhether the Act in question has been really useful, whether it has not\r\ndone more harm than good, by hampering and sometimes entirely\r\npreventing legitimate and beneficent investigation, I will not now\r\ndiscuss.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I commend Mr. Paget's book to the careful consideration of\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\n    LISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    PART I\r\n\r\n    EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\n                                          PAGE\r\n\r\n        I.

He\r\nalso proved that the arteries during life contain blood, not [Greek:\r\npneuma], or the breath of life:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ourselves, having tied the exposed arteries above and below,\r\n   opened them between the ligatures, and showed that they were\r\n   indeed full of blood.\"\r\n\r\nThough all vessels bleed when they are wounded, yet this experiment\r\nwas necessary to refute the fanciful teaching of Erasistratus and his\r\nfollowers, of whom Galen says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Erasistratus is pleased to believe that an artery is a vessel\r\n   containing the breath of life, and a vein is a vessel containing\r\n   blood; and that the vessels, dividing again and again, come at\r\n   last to be so small that they can close their ultimate pores,\r\n   and keep the blood controlled within them; yea, though the pores\r\n   of the vein and of the artery lie side by side, yet the blood\r\n   remains within its proper bounds, nowhere passing into the\r\n   vessels of the breath of life. But when the blood is driven with\r\n   violence from the veins into the arteries, forthwith there is\r\n   disease; and the blood is poured the wrong way into the\r\n   arteries, and there withstands and dashes itself against the\r\n   breath of life coming from the heart, and turns the course of\r\n   it--and this forsooth is fever.\"\r\n\r\nFor many centuries after Galen, men were content to worship his name\r\nand his doctrines, and forsook his method. They did not follow the way\r\nof experiment, and invented theories that were no help either in\r\nscience or in practice. Here, in Galen's observation of living\r\narteries, was a great opportunity for physiology; but the example that\r\nhe set to those who came after him was forgotten by them, and, from\r\nthe time of Galen to the time of the Renaissance, physiology remained\r\nalmost where he had left it. Of the men of the Renaissance, Servetus,\r\nCæsalpinus, Ruinius, and others, Harvey's near predecessors, this much\r\nonly need be said here, that they did not discover the circulation of\r\nthe blood; and that the claim made a few years ago to this discovery,\r\non behalf of Cæsalpinus, by his countrymen, was not successful. But it\r\nis probable that Realdus (1516-1557) did understand the passage of\r\nblood through the lungs, but not the general circulation. He says:--\r\n\r\n   \"The blood is carried through the pulmonary artery to the lung,\r\n   and there is attenuated; thence, mixed with air, it is carried\r\n   through the pulmonary vein to the left ventricle of the heart:\r\n   which thing no man hitherto has noted or left on record, though\r\n   it is most worthy of the observation of all men.... And this is\r\n   as true as truth itself; for if you will look, not only in the\r\n   dead body but also in the living animal, you will always find\r\n   this pulmonary vein full of blood, which assuredly it would not\r\n   be if it were designed only for air and vapours.... Verily, I\r\n   pray you, O candid reader, studious of authority, but more\r\n   studious of truth, to make experiment on animals. You will find\r\n   the pulmonary vein full of blood, not air or _fuligo_, as these\r\n   men call it, God help them. Only there is no pulsation in the\r\n   vein.\" (_De Re Anatomicâ_, Venice, 1559.)\r\n\r\nFabricius ab Aquapendente, Harvey's master at Padua, published his\r\nwork on the valves of the veins--_De Venarum Ostiolis_--in 1603. He\r\ndid not discover them. Sylvius speaks of them in his _Isagoge_\r\n(Venice, 1555), and they were known to Amatus (1552), and even to\r\nTheodoretus, Bishop of Syria, who lived, as John Hunter said of\r\nSennertus, \"the Lord knows how long ago.\" But Fabricius studied them\r\nmost carefully; and in anatomy he left nothing more to be said about\r\nthem. In physiology, his work was of little value; for he held that\r\nthey were designed \"to retard the blood in some measure, lest it\r\nshould run pell-mell into the feet, hands, and fingers, there to be\r\nimpacted\": they were to prevent distension of the veins, and to ensure\r\nthe due nourishment of all parts of the body. It is true that he\r\ncompared them to the locks or weirs of a river, but he understood\r\nneither the course nor the force of the blood: as Harvey said of him,\r\n\"The man who discovered these valves did not understand their right\r\nuse; neither did they who came after him\"--_Harum valvularum usum\r\nrectum inventor non est assecutus, nec alii addiderunt; non est enim\r\nne pondere deorsum sanguis in inferiora totus ruat; sunt namque in\r\njugularibus deorsum spectantes, et sanguinem sursum ferri\r\nprohibentes._ Men had no idea of the rapidity and volume of the\r\ncirculation; they thought of a sort of Stygian tide, oozing this way\r\nor that way in the vessels--Cæsalpinus was of opinion that it went one\r\nway in the daytime and another at night--nor did they see that the\r\npulmonary circulation and the general circulation are one system, the\r\nsame blood covering the whole course. The work that they did in\r\nanatomy was magnificent; Vesalius, and the other great anatomists of\r\nhis time, are unsurpassed. But physiology had been hindered for ages\r\nby fantastic imaginings, and the facts of the circulation of the blood\r\nwere almost as far from their interpretation in the sixteenth century\r\nas they had been in the time of Galen.\r\n\r\nII.--HARVEY (1578-1657)\r\n\r\nThe _De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus_ was published at\r\nFrankfurt in 1628. And it begins with these words: _Cum multis vivorum\r\ndissectionibus, uti ad manum dabantur_:--\r\n\r\n   \"When by many dissections of living animals, as they came to\r\n   hand, I first gave myself to observing how I might discover with\r\n   my own eyes, and not from books and the writings of other men,\r\n   the use and purpose of the movement of the heart in animals,\r\n   forthwith I found the matter hard indeed, and full of\r\n   difficulty: so that I began to think, with Frascatorius, that\r\n   the movement of the heart was known to God alone. For I could\r\n   not distinguish aright either the nature of its systole and\r\n   diastole, or when or where dilatation and contraction took\r\n   place; and this because of the swiftness of the movement, which\r\n   in many animals in the twinkling of an eye, like a flash of\r\n   lightning, revealed itself to sight and then was gone; so that I\r\n   came to believe that I saw systole and diastole now this way now\r\n   the other, and movements now apart and now together. Wherefore\r\n   my mind wavered; I had nothing assured to me, whether decided by\r\n   me or taken from other men: and I did not wonder that Andreas\r\n   Laurentius had written that the movement of the heart was what\r\n   the ebb and flow of the Euripus had been to Aristotle.\r\n\r\n   \"At last, having daily used greater disquisition and diligence,\r\n   by frequent examination of many and various living\r\n   animals--_multa frequenter et varia animalia viva\r\n   introspiciendo_--and many observations put together, I came to\r\n   believe that I had succeeded, and had escaped and got out of\r\n   this labyrinth, and therewith had discovered what I desired, the\r\n   movement and use of the heart and the arteries. And from that\r\n   time, not only to my friends, but also in public in my\r\n   anatomical lectures, after the manner of the Academy, I did not\r\n   fear to set forth my opinion in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain, from Harvey's own words, that he gives to experiments on\r\nanimals a foremost place among his methods of work. Take only the\r\nheadings of his first four chapters:--\r\n\r\n   i. _Causæ, quibus ad scribendum auctor permotus fuerit._\r\n\r\n   ii. _Ex vivorum dissectione, qualis fit cordis motus._\r\n\r\n   iii. _Arteriarum motus qualis, ex vivorum dissectione._\r\n\r\n   iv. _Motus cordis et auricularum qualis, ex vivorum\r\n   dissectione._\r\n\r\nHe thrusts it on us, he puts it in the foreground. Read the end of his\r\nPreface:--\r\n\r\n   \"Therefore, from these and many more things of the kind, it is\r\n   plain (since what has been said by men before me, of the\r\n   movement and use of the heart and arteries, appears inconsistent\r\n   or obscure or impossible when one carefully considers it) that\r\n   we shall do well to look deeper into the matter; to observe the\r\n   movements of the arteries and the heart, not only in man, but in\r\n   all animals that have hearts; and by frequent dissection of\r\n   living animals, and much use of our own eyes, to discern and\r\n   investigate the truth--_vivorum dissectione frequenti, multâque\r\n   autopsiâ, veritatem discernere et investigare_.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, take the famous passage in the eighth chapter, _De copiâ\r\nsanguinis transeuntis per cor e venis in arterias, et de circulari\r\nmotu sanguinis_:--\r\n\r\n   \"And now, as for the great quantity and forward movement of this\r\n   blood on its way, when I shall have said what things remain to\r\n   be said--though they are well worth considering, yet they are so\r\n   new and strange that I not only fear harm from the envy of\r\n   certain men, but am afraid lest I make all men my enemies; so\r\n   does custom, or a doctrine once imbibed and fixed down by deep\r\n   roots, like second nature, hold good among all men, and\r\n   reverence for antiquity constrains them. Be that as it may, the\r\n   die is cast now: my hope is in the love of truth, and the\r\n   candour of learned minds. I bethought me how great was the\r\n   quantity of this blood. Both from the dissection of living\r\n   animals for the sake of experiment, with opening of the\r\n   arteries, with observations manifold; and from the symmetry of\r\n   the size of the ventricles, and of the vessels entering and\r\n   leaving the heart--because Nature, doing nothing in vain, cannot\r\n   in vain have given such size to these vessels above the\r\n   rest--and from the harmonious and happy device of the valves and\r\n   fibres, and all other fabric of the heart; and from many other\r\n   things--when I had again and again carefully considered it all,\r\n   and had turned it over in my mind many times--I mean the great\r\n   quantity of the blood passing through, and the swiftness of its\r\n   passage--and I did not see how the juices of the food in the\r\n   stomach could help the veins from being emptied and drained dry,\r\n   and the arteries contrariwise from being ruptured by the\r\n   excessive flow of blood into them, unless blood were always\r\n   getting round from the arteries into the veins, and so back to\r\n   the right ventricle--I began to think to myself whether the\r\n   blood had a certain movement, as in a circle--_coepi egomet\r\n   mecum cogitare, an motionem quandam quasi in circulo\r\n   haberet_--which afterward I found was true.\"\r\n\r\nThis vehement passage, which goes with a rush like that of the blood\r\nitself, is a good example of the width and depth of Harvey's work--how\r\nhe used all methods that were open to him. He lived to fourscore\r\nyears; \"an old man,\" he says, \"far advanced in years, and occupied\r\nwith other cares\": and, near the end of his life, he told the Hon.\r\nRobert Boyle that the arrangement of the valves of the veins had given\r\nhim his first idea of the circulation of the blood:--\r\n\r\n   \"I remember that when I asked our famous Harvey, in the only\r\n   discourse I had with him, which was but a while before he died,\r\n   what were the things which induced him to think of the\r\n   circulation of the blood, he answered me that when he took\r\n   notice that the valves in the veins of so many parts of the body\r\n   were so placed that they gave free passage of the blood towards\r\n   the heart, but opposed the passage of the venal blood the\r\n   contrary way, he was invited to imagine that so provident a\r\n   cause as Nature had not so placed so many valves without design;\r\n   and no design seemed more probable than that, since the blood\r\n   could not well, because of the interposing valves, be sent by\r\n   the veins to the limbs, it should be sent by the arteries, and\r\n   return through the veins, whose valves did not oppose its course\r\n   that way.\"\r\n\r\nBut between this observation, which \"invited him to imagine\" a theory,\r\nand his final proofs of the circulation, lay a host of difficulties;\r\nand it is certain, from his own account of his work, that experiments\r\non animals were of the utmost help to him in leading him \"out of the\r\nlabyrinth.\"\r\n\r\nIII.--AFTER HARVEY\r\n\r\n1. _The Capillaries_\r\n\r\nThe capillary vessels were not known in Harvey's time: the\r\n_capillamenta_ of Cæsalpinus were not the capillaries, but the\r\n[Greek: neura] of Aristotle. It was believed that the blood, between\r\nthe smallest arteries and the smallest veins, made its way through\r\n\"blind porosities\" in the tissues, as water percolates through earth\r\nor through a sponge. The first account of the capillaries is in two\r\nletters (_De Pulmonibus_, 1661) from Malpighi, professor of medicine\r\nat Bologna, to Borelli, professor of mathematics at Pisa. In his first\r\nletter, Malpighi writes that he has tried in vain, by injecting the\r\ndead body, to discover how the blood passes from the arteries into the\r\nveins:--\r\n\r\n   \"This enigma hitherto distracts my mind, though for its solution\r\n   I have made many and many attempts, all in vain, with air and\r\n   various coloured fluids. Having injected ink with a syringe into\r\n   the pulmonary artery, I have again and again seen it escape\r\n   (become extravasated into the tissues) at several points. The\r\n   same thing happens with an injection of mercury. These\r\n   experiments do not give us the natural pathway of the blood.\"\r\n\r\nBut, in his second letter, he describes how he has examined, with a\r\nmicroscope of two lenses, the lung and the mesentery of a frog, and\r\nhas seen the capillaries, and the blood in them:--\r\n\r\n   \"Such is the divarication of these little vessels, coming off\r\n   from the vein and the artery, that the order in which the vessel\r\n   ramifies is no longer preserved, but it looks like a network\r\n   woven from the offshoots of both vessels.\"\r\n\r\nHe was able, in a dead frog, to see the capillaries; and then, in a\r\nliving frog, to see the blood moving in them. But, in spite of this\r\nwork, it took nearly half a century before Harvey's teaching was\r\nbelieved by all men--_Tantum consuetudo apud omnes valet_.\r\n\r\n2. _The Blood-pressure_\r\n\r\nHarvey had seen the facts of blood-pressure--_the great quantity of\r\nblood passing through, and the swiftness of its passage_--but he had\r\nnot measured it. Keill's experiments on the blood-pressure (1718) were\r\ninexact, and of no value; and the first exact measurements were made\r\nby Stephen Hales, who was rector of Farringdon, Hampshire, and\r\nminister of Teddington, Middlesex; a Doctor of Divinity, and a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society. His experiments, in their width and diversity,\r\nwere not surpassed even by those of John Hunter, and were extended far\r\nover physiology, vegetable physiology, organic and inorganic\r\nchemistry, and physics; they ranged from the invention of a sea-gauge\r\nto the study of solvents for the stone, and he seems to have\r\nexperimented on every force in Nature. The titles of his two volumes\r\nof _Statical Essays_ (1726-1733) show the great extent of his\r\nnon-clerical work:--\r\n\r\n   Volume I. _Statical Essays, containing Vegetable Statics, or an\r\n   Account of some Statical Experiments on the Sap in Vegetables,\r\n   being an Essay towards a Natural History of Vegetation; also, a\r\n   Specimen of an Attempt to Analyse the Air, by a great Variety of\r\n   Chymio-Statical Experiments._\r\n\r\n   Volume II. _Statical Essays, containing Hæmostatics, or an\r\n   Account of some Hydraulic and Hydrostatical Experiments made on\r\n   the Blood and Blood-vessels of Animals; also, an Account of some\r\n   Experiments on Stones in the Kidneys and Bladder, with an\r\n   Enquiry into the Nature of those anomalous Concretions._\r\n\r\n   \"We can never want matter for new experiments,\" he says in his\r\n   preface. \"We are as yet got little further than to the surface\r\n   of things: we must be content, in this our infant state of\r\n   knowledge, while we know in part only, to imitate children, who,\r\n   for want of better skill and abilities, and of more proper\r\n   materials, amuse themselves with slight buildings. The farther\r\n   advances we make in the knowledge of Nature, the more probable\r\n   and the nearer to truth will our conjectures approach: so that\r\n   succeeding generations, who shall have the benefit and advantage\r\n   both of their own observations and those of preceding\r\n   generations, may then make considerable advances, when _many\r\n   shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased_.\"\r\n\r\nHis account of his plan of measuring the blood-pressure, and of one of\r\nmany experiments that he made on it, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Finding but little satisfaction in what had been attempted on\r\n   this subject by Borellus and others, I endeavoured, about\r\n   twenty-five years since, by proper experiments, to find what was\r\n   the real force of the blood in the crural arteries of dogs, and\r\n   about six years afterwards I repeated the like experiments on\r\n   two horses, and a fallow doe; but did not then pursue the matter\r\n   any further, being discouraged by the disagreeableness of\r\n   anatomical dissections. But having of late years found by\r\n   experience the advantage of making use of the statical way of\r\n   investigation, not only in our researches into the nature of\r\n   vegetables, but also in the chymical analysis of the air, I was\r\n   induced to hope for some success, if the same method of enquiry\r\n   were applied to animal bodies....\r\n\r\n   \"Having laid open the left crural artery (of a mare), I inserted\r\n   into it a brass pipe whose bore was 1/6 of an inch in diameter;\r\n   and to that, by means of another brass pipe which was fitly\r\n   adapted to it, I fixed a glass tube of nearly the same diameter,\r\n   which was 9 feet in length; then, untying the ligature on the\r\n   artery, the blood rose in the tube 8 feet 3 inches perpendicular\r\n   above the level of the left ventricle of the heart, but it did\r\n   not attain to its full height at once: it rushed up gradually\r\n   at each pulse 12, 8, 6, 4, 2, and sometimes 1 inch. When it was\r\n   at its full height, it would rise and fall at and after each\r\n   pulse 2, 3, or 4 inches, and sometimes it would fall 12 or 14\r\n   inches, and have there for a time the same vibrations up and\r\n   down, at and after each pulse, as it had when it was at its full\r\n   height, to which it would rise again, after forty or fifty\r\n   pulses.\"\r\n\r\n3. _The Collateral Circulation_\r\n\r\nAfter Hales, came John Hunter, who was five years old when the\r\n_Statical Essays_ were published. His experiments on the blood were\r\nmostly concerned with its properties, not with its course; but one\r\ngreat experiment must be noted here that puts him in line with Harvey,\r\nMalpighi, and Hales. He got from it his knowledge of the collateral\r\ncirculation; he learned how the obstruction of an artery is followed\r\nby enlargement of the vessels in its neighbourhood, so that the parts\r\nbeyond the obstruction do not suffer from want of blood: and the facts\r\nof collateral circulation were fresh in his mind when, a few months\r\nlater, he conceived and performed his operation for aneurysm (December\r\n1785). The \"old operation\" gave him no help here; and \"Anel's\r\noperation\" was but a single instance, and no sure guide for Hunter,\r\nbecause Anel's patient had a different sort of aneurysm. Hunter knew\r\nthat the collateral circulation could be trusted to nourish the limb,\r\nif the femoral artery were ligatured in \"Hunter's canal\" for the cure\r\nof popliteal aneurysm; and he got this knowledge from the experiment\r\nthat he had made on one of the deer in Richmond Park, to see the\r\ninfluence of ligature of the carotid artery on the growth of the\r\nantler. The following account of this experiment was given by Sir\r\nRichard Owen, who had it from Mr. Clift, Hunter's devoted pupil and\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n   \"In the month of July, when the bucks' antlers were half-grown,\r\n   he caused one of them to be caught and thrown; and, knowing the\r\n   arterial supply to the hot 'velvet,' as the keepers call it,\r\n   Hunter cut down upon and tied the external carotid; upon which,\r\n   laying his hand upon the antler, he found that the pulsations of\r\n   the arterial channels stopped, and the surface soon grew cold.\r\n   The buck was released, and Hunter speculated on the\r\n   result--whether the antler, arrested at mid-growth, would be\r\n   shed like the full-grown one, or be longer retained. A week or\r\n   so afterward he drove down again to the park, and caused the\r\n   buck to be caught and thrown. The wound was healed about the\r\n   ligature; but on laying his hand on the antler, he found to his\r\n   surprise that the warmth had returned, and the channels of\r\n   supply to the velvety formative covering were again pulsating.\r\n   His first impression was that his operation had been defective.\r\n   To test this, he had the buck killed and sent to Leicester\r\n   Square. The arterial system was injected. Hunter found that the\r\n   external carotid had been duly tied. But certain small branches,\r\n   coming off on the proximal or heart's side of the ligature, had\r\n   enlarged; and, tracing-on these, he found that they had\r\n   anastomosed with other small branches from the distal\r\n   continuation of the carotid, and these new channels had restored\r\n   the supply to the growing antler.... Here was a consequence of\r\n   his experiment he had not at all foreseen or expected. A new\r\n   property of the living arteries was unfolded to him.\"\r\n\r\nAll the anatomists had overlooked this physiological change in the\r\nliving body, brought about by disease. And the surgeons, since anatomy\r\ncould not help them, had been driven by the mortality of the \"old\r\noperation\" to the practice of amputation.\r\n\r\n4. _The Mercurial Manometer_\r\n\r\nHale's experiments on the blood-pressure were admirable in their time;\r\nbut neither he nor his successors could take into account all the\r\nphysiological and mathematical facts of the case. But a great advance\r\nwas made in 1828, when Poiseuille published his thesis, _Sur la Force\r\ndu Coeur Aortique_, with a description of the mercurial manometer.\r\nPoiseuille had begun with the received idea that the blood-pressure in\r\nthe arteries would vary according to the distance from the heart, but\r\nhe found by experiment that this doctrine was wrong:--\r\n\r\n   \"At my first experiments, wishing to make sure whether the\r\n   opinions, given _à priori_, were true, I observed to my great\r\n   astonishment that two tubes, applied at the same time to two\r\n   arteries at different distances from the heart, gave columns of\r\n   exactly the same height, and not, as I had expected, of\r\n   different heights. This made the work very much simpler,\r\n   because, to whatever artery I applied the instrument, I obtained\r\n   the same results that I should have got by placing it on the\r\n   ascending aorta itself.\"\r\n\r\nHe found also, by experiments, that the coagulation of the blood in\r\nthe tube could be prevented by filling one part of the tube with a\r\nsaturated solution of sodium carbonate. The tube, thus prepared, was\r\nconnected with the artery by a fine cannula, exactly fitting the\r\nartery. With this instrument, Poiseuille was able to obtain results\r\nfar more accurate than those of Hales, and to observe the diverse\r\ninfluences of the respiratory movements on the blood-pressure. He sums\r\nup his results in these words:--\r\n\r\n   \"I come to this irrevocable conclusion, that the force with\r\n   which a molecule of blood moves, whether in the carotid, or in\r\n   the aorta, etc., is exactly equal to the force which moves a\r\n   molecule in the smallest arterial branch; or, in other words,\r\n   that a molecule of blood moves with the same force over the\r\n   whole course of the arterial system--which, _à priori_, with all\r\n   the physiologists, I was far from thinking.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he adds, in a footnote:--\r\n\r\n   \"When I say that this force is the same over the whole course of\r\n   the arterial system, I do not mean to deny that it must needs be\r\n   modified at certain points of this system, which present a\r\n   special arrangement, such as the anastomosing arches of the\r\n   mesentery, the arterial circle of Willis, etc.\"\r\n\r\nLater, in 1835, he published a very valuable memoir on the movement of\r\nthe blood in the capillaries under different conditions of heat, cold,\r\nand atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n5. _The Registration of the Blood-pressure_\r\n\r\nPoiseuille's work, in its turn, was left behind as physiology went\r\nforward: especially, the discovery of the vaso-motor nerves compelled\r\nphysiologists to reconsider the whole subject of the blood-pressure.\r\nIf Poiseuille's thesis (1828) be compared with Marey's book (1863),\r\n_Physiologie Médicale de la Circulation du Sang_, it will be evident\r\nat once how much wider and deeper the problem had become. Poiseuille's\r\nthesis is chiefly concerned with mathematics and hydrostatics; it\r\nsuggests no method of immediate permanent registration of the pulse,\r\nand is of no great value to practical medicine: Marey's book, by its\r\nvery title, shows what a long advance had been made between 1828 and\r\n1863--_Physiologie Médicale de la Circulation du Sang, basée sur\r\nl'étude graphique des mouvements du coeur et du pouls artériel, avec\r\napplication aux maladies de l'appareil circulatoire_. Though the\r\ncontrast is great between Hales' may-pole and Poiseuille's manometer,\r\nthere is even a greater contrast between Poiseuille's mathematical\r\ncalculations and Marey's practical use of the sphygmograph for the\r\nstudy of the blood-pressure in health and disease. Marey had the\r\nhappiness of seeing medicine, physiology, and physics, all three of\r\nthem working to one end:--\r\n\r\n   \"La circulation du sang est un des sujets pour lesquels la\r\n   médecine a le plus besoin de s'éclairer de la physiologie, et où\r\n   celle-ci à son tour tire le plus de lumière des sciences\r\n   physiques. Ces dernières années sont marquées par deux grands\r\n   progrès qui ouvrent aux recherches à venir des horizons\r\n   nouveaux: en Allemagne, l'introduction des procédés graphiques\r\n   dans l'étude du mouvement du sang; en France, la démonstration\r\n   de l'influence du système nerveux sur la circulation\r\n   périphérique. Cette dernière découverte, que nous devons à M.\r\n   Cl. Bernard, et qui depuis dix ans a donné tant d'impulsion à la\r\n   science, montre mieux que toute autre combien la physiologie est\r\n   indispensable à la médecine, tandis que les travaux allemands\r\n   ont bien fait ressortir l'importance des connaissances physiques\r\n   dans les études médicales.\"\r\n\r\nMarey's sphygmograph was not the first instrument of its kind. There\r\nhad been, before it, Hérisson's sphygmometer, Ludwig's kymographion,\r\nand the sphygmographs of Volckmann, King, and Vierordt. But, if one\r\ncompares a Vierordt tracing with a Marey tracing, it will be plain\r\nthat Marey's results were far advanced beyond the useless\r\n\"oscillations isochrones\" recorded by Vierordt's instrument.\r\n\r\nBeside this improved sphygmograph, Chauveau and Marey also invented\r\nthe cardiograph, for the observation of the blood-pressure within the\r\ncavities of the heart. Their cardiograph was a set of very delicate\r\nelastic tambours, resting on the heart, or passed through fine tubes\r\ninto the cavities of the heart,[1] and communicating impulses to\r\nlevers with writing-points. These writing-points, touching a revolving\r\ncylinder, recorded the variations of the endocardial pressure, and the\r\nduration of the auricular and ventricular contractions.\r\n\r\n  [1] \"On peut s'assurer de l'innocuité de ce premier temps de\r\n  l'expérience en examinant l'animal, qui n'est nullement troublé,\r\n  qui marche et mange comme de coutume. En comptant le chiffre du\r\n  pouls, on trouve quelquefois une légère accéleration, surtout dans\r\n  les premiers instants; mais les mouvements du coeur sont toujours\r\n  réguliers, et donnent, à l'auscultation, des bruits d'un caractère\r\n  normal.\" (Marey, _loc. cit._ p. 63.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to describe the subsequent study of those more\r\nabstruse problems that the older physiologists had not so much as\r\nthought of: the minutest variations of the blood-pressure, the\r\nmultiple influences of the nervous system on the heart and\r\nblood-vessels, the relations between blood-pressure and secretion, the\r\nautomatism of the heart-beat, the influence of gravitation, and other\r\nfiner and more complex issues of physiology. But, even if one stops at\r\nMarey's book, now more than forty years old, there is an abundant\r\nrecord of good work, from the discovery of the circulation to the\r\ninvention of the sphygmograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE LACTEALS\r\n\r\nAsellius, in his account of his discovery of the lacteal vessels\r\n(1622), is of opinion that certain of \"the ancients\" had seen these\r\nvessels, but had not recognised them. He has a great reverence for\r\nauthority: Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Herophilus,\r\nGalen, Pollux, Rhases, and a host of other names, he quotes them all,\r\nand all with profound respect; and comes to this conclusion: \"It did\r\nnot escape the ancients, that certain vessels must needs be concerned\r\nwith containing and carrying the chyle, and certain other vessels with\r\nthe blood: but the true and very vessels of the chyle, that is, my\r\n'veins,' though they were seen by some of the ancients, yet they were\r\nrecognised by none of them.\" He can forgive them all, except Galen,\r\n_qui videtur nosse omnino debuisse_--\"but, as for Galen, I know not at\r\nall what I am to think. For he, who made more than six hundred\r\nsections of living animals, as he boasts himself, and so often opened\r\nmany animals when they were lately fed, are we to think it possible\r\nthat these veins never showed themselves to him, that he never had\r\nthem under his eyes, that he never investigated them--he to whom\r\nErasistratus had given so great cause for searching out the whole\r\nmatter?\" Probably, the milk-white threads had been taken for nerves by\r\nthose who had seen them: and those who had never seen them, but\r\nbelieved in their existence, rested their belief on a general idea\r\nthat the chyle must, somehow, have vessels of its own apart from the\r\nblood-vessels. What Galen and Erasistratus must have seen, Asellius\r\nand Pecquet discovered: and Harvey gives a careful review of the\r\ndiscovery in his letters to Nardi (May 1652) and to Morison (November\r\n1653). He does not accept it; but the point is that he recognises it\r\nas a new thing altogether.\r\n\r\nA year or two after he had made the discovery, Asellius died; and his\r\nwork was published in 1627 by two Milanese physicians, and was\r\ndedicated by them to the senate of the Academy of Milan, where\r\nAsellius had been professor of anatomy. The full title of his book is,\r\n_De Lactibus sive Lacteis Venis, quarto Vasorum Mesaraicorum genere\r\nnovo invento, Gasparis Asellii Cremonensis, Anatomici Ticinensis,\r\nDissertatio. Quâ sententiæ anatomicæ multæ vel perperam receptæ\r\nconvelluntur vel partim perceptæ illustrantur._ He gives the following\r\naccount of the discovery, in the chapter entitled _Historia primæ\r\nvasorum istorum inventionis cum fide narrata_. On 23rd July 1622,\r\ndemonstrating the movement of the diaphragm in a dog, he observed\r\nsuddenly, \"as it were, many threads, very thin and very white,\r\ndispersed through the whole mesentery and through the intestines, with\r\nramifications almost endless\"--_plurimos, eosque tenuissimos\r\ncandido-sissimosque ceu funiculos per omne mesenterium et per\r\nintestina infinitis propemodum propaginibus dispersos_:--\r\n\r\n   \"Thinking at first sight that they were nerves, I did not\r\n   greatly heed them. But soon I saw that I was wrong, for I\r\n   bethought me that the nerves, which belong to the intestines,\r\n   are distinct from these threads, and very different from them,\r\n   and have a separate course. Wherefore, struck by the newness of\r\n   the matter, I stopped for a time silent, while one way and\r\n   another there came to my mind the controversies that occupy\r\n   anatomists, as to the mesenteric veins and their use; which\r\n   controversies are as full of quarrels as of words. When I had\r\n   pulled myself together, to make experiment, taking a very sharp\r\n   scalpel, I pierce one of the larger threads. Scarcely had I hit\r\n   it off, when I see a white fluid running out, like milk or\r\n   cream. At which sight, when I could not hold my joy, turning to\r\n   those who were there, first to Alexander Tadinus and Senator\r\n   Septalius, both of them members of the most honourable College\r\n   of Physicians, and, at the time of this writing, officers of the\r\n   public health, '_I have found it_,' I say like Archimedes; and\r\n   therewith invite them to the so pleasant sight of a thing so\r\n   unwonted; they being agitated, like myself, by the newness of\r\n   it.\"\r\n\r\nHe then describes the collapse and disappearance of the vessels at\r\ndeath, and the many experiments which he made for further study of\r\nthem; and the failure, when he tried to find them in animals not\r\nlately fed. He did not trace them beyond the mesentery, and believed\r\nthat they emptied themselves into the liver. The discovery of their\r\nconnection with the receptaculum chyli and the thoracic duct was made\r\nby Jehan Pecquet of Dieppe, Madame de Sévigné's doctor, her \"good\r\nlittle Pecquet.\" The full title of his book (2nd ed., 1654) is,\r\n_Expérimenta Nova Anatomica, quibus incognitum hactenus Receptaculum,\r\net ab eo per Thoracem in ramos usque subclavios Vasa Lactea\r\ndeteguntur_. He has not the academical learning of Asellius, nor his\r\nobsequious regard for the ancients; and the discovery of the thoracic\r\nduct came, as it were by chance, out of an experiment that was of\r\nitself wholly useless. He had killed an animal by removing its heart,\r\nand then saw a small quantity of milky fluid coming from the cut end\r\nof the vena cava--_Albicantem subinde Lactei liquoris, nec certe parum\r\nfluidi scaturiginem, intra Venæ Cavæ fistulam, circ[=a] dextri sedem\r\nVentriculi, miror effluere_--and found that this fluid was identical\r\nwith the chyle in the lacteals. In another experiment, he succeeded in\r\nfinding the thoracic duct--\"At last, by careful examination deep down\r\nalong the sides of the dorsal vertebræ, a sort of whiteness, as of a\r\nlacteal vessel, catches my eyes. It lay in a sinuous course, close up\r\nagainst the spine. I was in doubt, for all my scrutiny, whether I had\r\nto do with a nerve or with a vessel. Therefore, I put a ligature a\r\nlittle below the clavicular veins; and then the flaccidity above the\r\nligature, and the swelling of the distended duct below the ligature,\r\nbroke down my doubt--_Ergo subducto paulo infra Claviculas vinculo,\r\ncum a ligaturâ sursum flaccesceret, superstite deorsum turgentis\r\nalveoli tumore, dubium meum penitus enervavit.... Laxatis vinculis,\r\nlacteus utrinque rivulus in Cavam affatim Chylum profudit._\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that Asellius and Pecquet, both of them, made their\r\ndiscoveries as it were by chance. Unless digestion were going on, the\r\nlacteals would be empty and invisible; and, on the dead body,\r\nlacteals, receptaculum, and thoracic duct would all be empty. For\r\nthese reasons, it cost a vast number of experiments to prove the\r\nexistence, and to discover the course, of these vessels. Once found in\r\nliving animals, they could be injected and dissected in the dead body;\r\nbut they had been overlooked by Vesalius and the men of his time.\r\n\r\nFrom the discovery of the lacteals came the discovery of the whole\r\nlymphatic system. Daremberg, in his _Histoire des Sciences Médicales_\r\n(Paris, 1870), after an account of Pecquet's work, says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Up to this point, we have seen English, Italians, and French\r\n   working together, with more or less success and genius, to trace\r\n   the true ways of blood and chyle: there is yet one field of work\r\n   to open up, the lymphatics of the body. The chief honour here\r\n   belongs, without doubt, to the Swede Rudbeck, though the Dane\r\n   Bartholin has disputed it with him, with equal acrimony and\r\n   injustice.\"\r\n\r\nRudbeck's work (1651-54) coincides exactly, in point of time, with the\r\nfirst and second editions, 1651 and 1654, of Pecquet's _De Lactibus_.\r\nIt may be said, therefore, that the whole doctrine of the lymphatic\r\nsystem was roughed out half-way through the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE GASTRIC JUICE\r\n\r\nFrom many causes, the experimental study of the digestive processes\r\ncame later than the study of the circulation. As an object of\r\nspeculative thought, digestion was a lower phase of life, the work of\r\ncrass spirits, less noble than the blood; from the point of view of\r\nscience, it could not be studied ahead of organic chemistry, and got\r\nno help from any other sort of knowledge; and, from the medical point\r\nof view, it was the final result of many unknown internal forces that\r\ncould not be observed or estimated either in life or after death. It\r\ndid not, like the circulation, centre itself round one problem; it\r\ncould not be focussed by the work of one man. For these reasons, and\r\nespecially because of its absolute dependence on chemistry for the\r\ninterpretation of its facts, it had to bide its time; and Réaumur's\r\nexperiments are separated from the publication of Harvey's _De Motu\r\nCordis et Sanguinis_ by a hundred and thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the first experiments on digestion is taken\r\nfrom Claude Bernard's _Physiologie Opératoire_, 1879:--\r\n\r\n   \"The true experimental study of digestion is of comparatively\r\n   recent date; the ancients were content to find comparisons, more\r\n   or less happy, with common facts. Thus, for Hippocrates,\r\n   digestion was a 'coction': for Galen, a 'fermentation,' as of\r\n   wine in a vat. In later times, van Helmont started this\r\n   comparison again: for him, digestion was a fermentation like\r\n   that of bread: as the baker, having kneaded the bread, keeps a\r\n   little of the dough to leaven the next lot kneaded, so, said van\r\n   Helmont, the intestinal canal never completely empties itself,\r\n   and the residue that it keeps after each digestion becomes the\r\n   leaven that shall serve for the next digestion.\r\n\r\n   \"The first experimental studies on the digestion date from the\r\n   end of the seventeenth century, when the Academy of Florence was\r\n   the scene of a famous and long controversy between Borelli and\r\n   Valisnieri. The former saw nothing more in digestion than a\r\n   purely mechanical act, a work of attrition whereby the ingesta\r\n   were finely divided and as it were pulverised: and in support of\r\n   this opinion Borelli invoked the facts that he had observed\r\n   relating to the gizzard of birds. We know that this sac, with\r\n   its very thick muscular walls, can exercise on its contents\r\n   pressure enough to break the hardest bodies. Identifying the\r\n   human stomach with the bird's gizzard, Borelli was led to\r\n   attribute to the walls of the stomach an enormous force,\r\n   estimated at more than a thousand pounds; whose action, he said,\r\n   was the very essence of digestion. Valisnieri, on the contrary,\r\n   having had occasion to open the stomach of an ostrich, had found\r\n   there a fluid which seemed to act on bodies immersed in it; this\r\n   fluid, he said, was the active agent of digestion, a kind of\r\n   _aqua fortis_ that dissolved food.\r\n\r\n   \"These two opposed views, resulting rather from observations\r\n   than from regularly instituted experiments, were the\r\n   starting-point of the experimental researches undertaken by\r\n   Réaumur in 1752. To resolve the problem set by Borelli and\r\n   Valisnieri, Réaumur made birds swallow food enclosed in\r\n   fenestrated tubes, so that the food, protected from the\r\n   mechanical action of the walls of the stomach, was yet exposed\r\n   to the action of the gastric fluid. The first tubes used\r\n   (glass, tin, etc.) were crushed, bent, or flattened by the\r\n   action of the walls of the gizzard; and Réaumur failed to oppose\r\n   to this force a sufficient resistance, till he employed leaden\r\n   tubes thick enough not to be flattened by a pressure of 484\r\n   pounds: which was, in fact, the force exercised by the\r\n   contractile walls of the gizzard in turkeys, ducks, and fowls\r\n   under observation. These leaden tubes--filled with ordinary\r\n   grain, and closed only by a netting that let pass the gastric\r\n   juices--these tubes, after a long stay in the stomach, still\r\n   enclosed grain wholly intact, unless it had been crushed before\r\n   the experiment. When they were filled with meat, it was found\r\n   changed, but not digested. Réaumur was thus led at first to\r\n   consider digestion, in the gallinaceæ, as pure and simple\r\n   trituration. But, repeating these experiments on birds of prey,\r\n   he observed that digestion in them consists essentially in\r\n   dissolution, without any especial mechanical action, and that it\r\n   is the same with the digestion of meat in all animals with\r\n   membranous stomachs. To procure this dissolving fluid, Réaumur\r\n   made the birds swallow sponges with threads attached:\r\n   withdrawing these sponges after a definite period, he squeezed\r\n   the fluid into a glass, and tested its action on meat. That was\r\n   the first attempt at artificial digestion _in vitro_. He did not\r\n   carry these last investigations very far, and did not obtain\r\n   very decisive results; nevertheless he must be considered as the\r\n   discoverer of artificial digestion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Réaumur, the Abbé Spallanzani (1783) made similar observations\r\non many other animals, including carnivora. He showed that even in the\r\ngallinaceæ there was dissolution of food, not mere trituration: and\r\nobserved how after death the gastric fluid may under certain\r\nconditions act on the walls of the stomach itself.\r\n\r\n   \"Henceforth the experimental method had cut the knot of the\r\n   question raised by the theories of Borelli and Valisnieri:\r\n   digestion could no longer be accounted anything but a\r\n   dissolution of food by the fluid of the stomach, the gastric\r\n   juice. But men had still to understand this gastric juice, and\r\n   to determine its nature and mode of action. Nothing could be\r\n   more contradictory than the views on this matter. Chaussier and\r\n   Dumas, of Montpellier, regarded the gastric juice as of very\r\n   variable composition, one time alkaline, another acid, according\r\n   to the food ingested. Side by side with these wholly theoretical\r\n   opinions, certain results of experiments had led to ideas just\r\n   as erroneous, for want of rigorous criticism of methods; it was\r\n   thus that Montègre denied the existence of the gastric juice as\r\n   a special fluid; what men took for gastric juice, he said, was\r\n   nothing but the saliva turned acid in the stomach. To prove his\r\n   point, he made the following experiment:--He masticated a bit of\r\n   bread, then put it out on a plate; it was at first alkaline,\r\n   then at the end of some time it became acid. In those days\r\n   (1813) this experiment was a real embarrassment to the men who\r\n   believed in the existence of a special gastric juice: we have\r\n   now no need to refute it.\r\n\r\n   \"These few instances suffice to show how the physiologists were\r\n   unsettled as to the nature and properties of the gastric juice.\r\n   Then (1823) the Academy had the happy idea of proposing\r\n   digestion as a subject for a prize. Tiedemann and Gmelin in\r\n   Germany, Leuret and Lassaigne in France, submitted works of\r\n   equal merit, and the Academy divided the prize between them. The\r\n   work of Tiedemann and Gmelin is of especial interest to us on\r\n   account of the great number of their experiments, from which\r\n   came not only the absolute proof of the existence of the gastric\r\n   juice, but also the study of the transformation of starch into\r\n   glucose. Thus the theory of digestion entered a new phase: it\r\n   was finally recognised, at least for certain substances, that\r\n   digestion is not simply dissolution, but a true chemical\r\n   transformation.\" (Cl. Bernard, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Dr. William Beaumont, a surgeon in the United States Army,\r\nbegan his famous experiments on Alexis St. Martin, a young Canadian\r\ntravelling for the American Fur Company, who was shot in the abdomen\r\non 6th June 1822, and recovered, but was left with a permanent opening\r\nin his stomach. Since the surgery of those days did not favour an\r\noperation to close this fistula, Dr. Beaumont took St. Martin into his\r\nservice, and between 1825 and 1833 made a vast number of experiments\r\non him. These he published,[2] and they were of great value. But it is\r\nto be noted that the ground had been cleared already, fifty years\r\nbefore, by Réaumur and Spallanzani:--\r\n\r\n   \"_I make no claim to originality in my opinions_, as it respects\r\n   the existence and operation of the gastric juice. My experiments\r\n   confirm the doctrines (with some modifications) taught by\r\n   Spallanzani, and many of the most enlightened physiological\r\n   writers.\" (Preface to Dr. Beaumont's book.)\r\n\r\n  [2] _Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice, and the\r\n  Physiology of Digestion_, by William Beaumont, M.D.; Edinburgh,\r\n  1838.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is to be noted that Alexis St. Martin's case proves that a\r\ngastric fistula is not painful. Scores of experiments were made on\r\nhim, off and on, for nine years:--\r\n\r\n   \"During the whole of these periods, from the spring of 1824 to\r\n   the present time (1833), he has enjoyed general good health, and\r\n   perhaps suffered much less predisposition to disease than is\r\n   common to men of his age and circumstances in life. He has been\r\n   active, athletic, and vigorous; exercising, eating, and drinking\r\n   like other healthy and active people. For the last four months\r\n   he has been unusually plethoric and robust, though constantly\r\n   subjected to a continuous series of experiments on the interior\r\n   of the stomach; allowing to be introduced or taken out at the\r\n   aperture different kinds of food, drinks, elastic catheters,\r\n   thermometer tubes, gastric juice, chyme, etc., almost daily, and\r\n   sometimes hourly.\r\n\r\n   \"Such have been this man's condition and circumstances for\r\n   several years past; and he now enjoys the most perfect health\r\n   and constitutional soundness, with every function of the system\r\n   in full force and vigour.\" (Dr. Beaumont, _loc. cit_. p. 20.)\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Eberlé published a series of observations on the extraction of\r\ngastric juice from the mucous membrane of the stomach after death; in\r\n1842 Blondlot of Nancy studied the gastric juice of animals by the\r\nmethod of a fistula, such as Alexis St. Martin had offered for Dr.\r\nBeaumont's observation. After Blondlot, came experiments on the\r\nmovements of the stomach, and on the manifold influences of the\r\nnervous system on digestion.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, times past number, that an animal with a fistula is\r\nin pain. It is not true. The case of St. Martin is but one out of a\r\nmultitude of these cases: an artificial orifice of this kind is not\r\npainful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGLYCOGEN\r\n\r\nClaude Bernard's discovery of glycogen in the liver had a profound\r\ninfluence both on physiology and on pathology. Take first its\r\ninfluence on pathology. Diabetes was known to Celsus, Aretæus, and\r\nGalen; Willis, in 1674, and Morton, in 1675, noted the distinctive\r\nsweetness of the urine; and their successors proved the presence of\r\nsugar in it. Rollo, in 1787, observed that vegetable food was bad for\r\ndiabetic patients, and introduced the strict use of a meat diet. But\r\nGalen had believed that diabetes was a disease of the kidneys, and\r\nmost men still followed him: nor did Rollo greatly advance pathology\r\nby following not Galen, but Aretæus. Later, with the development of\r\norganic chemistry, came the work of Chevreuil (1815), Tiedemann and\r\nGmelin (1823), and other illustrious chemists: and the pathology of\r\ndiabetes grew more and more difficult:--\r\n\r\n   \"These observations gave rise to two theories: the one, that\r\n   sugar is formed with abnormal rapidity in the intestine,\r\n   absorbed into the blood, and excreted in the urine; the other,\r\n   that diabetes is due to imperfect destruction of the sugar,\r\n   either in the intestine or in the blood. Some held that it\r\n   underwent conversion into lactic acid as it was passing through\r\n   the intestinal walls, while others believed it to be destroyed\r\n   in the blood by means of the alkali therein contained.\"[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] _Reynolds' System of Medicine_, vol. v., art. \"Diabetes\r\n  Mellitus.\"\r\n\r\nThus, before Claude Bernard (1813-1878), the pathology of diabetes was\r\nalmost worthless. And, in physiology, his work was hardly less\r\nimportant than the work of Harvey. A full account of it, in all its\r\nbearings, is given in Sir Michael Foster's _Life of Claude Bernard_\r\n(Fisher Unwin, 1899).\r\n\r\nIn Bernard's _Leçons sur le Diabète et la Glycogenèse Animale_ (Paris,\r\n1877), there is a sentence that has been misquoted many times:--\r\n\r\n_Sans doute, nos mains sont vides aujourd'hui, mais notre bouche peut\r\nêtre pleine de légitimes promesses pour l'avenir._\r\n\r\nThis sentence has been worked so hard that some of the words have got\r\nrubbed off it: and the statement generally made is of this kind:--\r\n\r\n_Claude Bernard himself confessed that his hands were empty, but his\r\nmouth was full of promises._\r\n\r\nOf course, he did not mean that he was wrong in his facts. But, in\r\nthis particular lecture, he is speaking of the want of more science in\r\npractice, looking forward to a time when treatment should be based on\r\nscience, not on tradition. Medicine, he says, is neither science nor\r\nart. Not science--_Trouverait-on aujourd'hui un seul médecin\r\nraisonnable et instruit osant dire qu'il prévoit d'une manière\r\ncertaine la marche et l'issue d'une maladie ou l'effet d'une remède?_\r\nNot art, because art has always something to show for its trouble: a\r\nstatue, a picture, a poem--_Le médecin artiste ne crée rien, et ne\r\nlaisse aucune oeuvre d'art, à moins d'appliquer ce titre à la guérison\r\ndu malade. Mais quand le malade meurt, est-ce également son oeuvre? Et\r\nquand il guérit, peut-il distinguer sa part de celle de la nature?_\r\n\r\nTo Claude Bernard, experiments on animals for the direct advancement\r\nof medicine seemed a new thing: new, at all events, in comparison with\r\nthe methods of some men of his time. He was only saying what Sir John\r\nBurdon Sanderson said in 1875 to the Royal Commission:--\r\n\r\n_It is my profound conviction that a future will come, it may be a\r\nsomewhat distant future, in which the treatment of disease will be\r\nreally guided by science. Just as completely as mechanical science has\r\ncome to be the guide of the mechanical arts, do I believe, and I feel\r\nconfident, that physiological science will eventually come to be the\r\nguide of medicine and surgery._\r\n\r\nAnyhow, lecturing a quarter of a century ago on diabetes, his special\r\nsubject, Claude Bernard spoke out his longing to compel men into the\r\nways of science, to give them some immediate sign which they could not\r\nrefuse to see:--\r\n\r\n   \"At this present time, medicine is passing from one period to\r\n   another. The old traditions are losing ground, and scientific\r\n   medicine (_la médecine expérimentale_) has got hold of all our\r\n   younger men: every day it gains ground, and will establish\r\n   itself against all its critics, and in spite of the excesses of\r\n   those who are over-zealous for its honour.... And when men ask\r\n   us what are the results of scientific medicine, we are driven to\r\n   answer that it is scarcely born, that it is still in the making.\r\n   Those who care for nothing but an immediate practical\r\n   application must remember Franklin's words, _What is the use of\r\n   a new-born child, but to become a man?_ If you deliberately\r\n   reject scientific medicine, you fail to see the natural\r\n   development of man's mind in all the sciences. Without doubt,\r\n   our hands are empty to-day, but our mouth may well be filled\r\n   with legitimate promises for the future.\"\r\n\r\nHe died in 1878. The following account of the discovery of glycogen is\r\ntaken from his _Nouvelle Fonction du Foie_ (Paris, 1853):--\r\n\r\n   \"My first researches into the assimilation and destruction of\r\n   sugar in the living organism were made in 1843: and in my\r\n   inaugural thesis (Dec. 1843) I published my first experiments on\r\n   the subject. I succeeded in demonstrating a fact hitherto\r\n   unknown, that cane-sugar cannot be directly destroyed in the\r\n   blood. If you inject even a very small quantity of cane-sugar,\r\n   dissolved in water, into the blood or under the skin of a\r\n   rabbit, you find it again in the urine unchanged, with all its\r\n   chemical properties the same.... I had soon to give up my first\r\n   point of view, because this question of the existence of a\r\n   sugar-producing organ, that I had thought such a hard problem of\r\n   physiology, was really the first thing revealed to me, as it\r\n   were of itself, at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept two dogs on different diets, one with sugar, the other without\r\nit; then killed them during digestion, and tested the blood in the\r\nhepatic veins:--\r\n\r\n   \"What was my surprise, when I found a considerable quantity of\r\n   sugar in the hepatic veins of the dog that had been fed on meat\r\n   only, and had been kept for eight days without sugar: just as I\r\n   found it in the other dog that had been fed for the same time on\r\n   food rich in sugar....\r\n\r\n   \"Finally, after many attempts--_après beaucoup d'essais et\r\n   plusieurs illusions que je fus obligé de rectifier par des\r\n   tâtonnements_--I succeeded in showing, that in dogs fed on meat\r\n   the blood passing through the portal vein does not contain sugar\r\n   before it reaches the liver; but when it leaves the liver, and\r\n   comes by the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava, this\r\n   same blood contains a considerable quantity of a sugary\r\n   substance (glucose).\"\r\n\r\nHis further discovery, that this formation of sugar is increased by\r\npuncture of the floor of the fourth ventricle, was published in 1849.\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Claude Bernard's\r\nsingle-handed work in this field of physiology and pathology:--\r\n\r\n   \"As a mere contribution to the history of sugar within the\r\n   animal body, as a link in the chain of special problems\r\n   connected with digestion and nutrition, its value was very\r\n   great. Even greater, perhaps, was its effect as a contribution\r\n   to general views. The view that the animal body, in contrast to\r\n   the plant, could not construct, could only destroy, was, as we\r\n   have seen, already being shaken. But evidence, however strong,\r\n   offered in the form of numerical comparisons between income and\r\n   output, failed to produce anything like the conviction which was\r\n   brought home to every one by the demonstration that a substance\r\n   was actually formed within the animal body, and by the\r\n   exhibition of the substance so formed.\r\n\r\n   \"No less revolutionary was the demonstration that the liver had\r\n   other things to do in the animal economy besides secreting bile.\r\n   This, at one blow, destroyed the then dominant conception that\r\n   the animal body was to be regarded as a bundle of organs, each\r\n   with its appropriate function, a conception which did much to\r\n   narrow inquiry, since when a suitable function had once been\r\n   assigned to an organ there seemed no need for further\r\n   investigations....\r\n\r\n   \"No less pregnant of future discoveries was the idea suggested\r\n   by this newly-found-out action of the hepatic tissue, the idea\r\n   happily formulated by Bernard as 'internal secretion.' No part\r\n   of physiology is at the present day being more fruitfully\r\n   studied than that which deals with the changes which the blood\r\n   undergoes as it sweeps through the several tissues, changes by\r\n   the careful adaptation of which what we call the health of the\r\n   body is secured, changes the failure or discordance of which\r\n   entails disease. The study of these internal secretions\r\n   constitutes a path of inquiry which has already been trod with\r\n   conspicuous success, and which promises to lead to untold\r\n   discoveries of the greatest moment; the gate to this path was\r\n   opened by Bernard's work.\" (Sir M. Foster, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\nBut the work to be done, before all the clinical facts of the disease\r\ncan be stated in terms of physiology, is not yet finished. In England,\r\nespecial honour is due to Dr. Pavy for his life-long study of this\r\nmost complex problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE PANCREAS\r\n\r\nHere again Claude Bernard's name must be put first. Before him, the\r\ndiverse actions of the pancreatic juice had hardly been studied.\r\nVesalius, greatest of all anatomists, makes no mention of the duct of\r\nthe pancreas, and speaks of the gland itself as though its purpose\r\nwere just to support the parts in its neighbourhood--_ut ventriculo\r\ninstar substerniculi ac pulvinaris subjiciatur_. The duct was\r\ndiscovered by Wirsung, in 1642: but anatomy could not see the things\r\nthat belong to physiology. Lindanus (1653) said, _I cannot doubt that\r\nthe pancreas expurgates, in the ordinary course of Nature, those\r\nimpurities of the blood that are too crass and inept to be tamed by\r\nthe spleen: and, in the extraordinary course, all black bile, begotten\r\nof disease or intemperate living_. Wharton (1656) said, _It ministers\r\nto the nerves, taking up certain of their superfluities, and remitting\r\nthem through its duct into the intestines_. And Tommaso Bartholini\r\n(1666) called it the _biliary vesicle of the spleen_.\r\n\r\nThis chaos of ideas was brought into some sort of order by Regnier de\r\nGraaf, pupil of François de Bois (Sylvius). De Bois had guessed that\r\nthe pancreas must be considered not according to its position in the\r\nbody, but according to its structure: that it was analogous to the\r\nsalivary glands. He urged his pupil to make experiments on it: and de\r\nGraaf says:--\r\n\r\n   \"I put my hand to the work: and though many times I despaired of\r\n   success, yet at last, by the blessing of God on my work and\r\n   prayers, in the year 1660 I discovered a way of collecting the\r\n   pancreatic juice.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, by further experiment, he refuted Bartholini's theory that the\r\npancreas was dependent on the spleen.\r\n\r\nSylvius had supposed that the pancreatic juice was slightly acid, and\r\nde Graaf failed to note this mistake; but it was corrected by Bohn's\r\nexperiments in 1710.\r\n\r\nNearly two hundred years come between Regnier de Graaf and Claude\r\nBernard: it is no wonder that Sir Michael Foster says that de Graaf's\r\nwork was \"very imperfect and fruitless.\" So late as 1840, there was\r\nyet no clear understanding of the action of the pancreas. Physiology\r\ncould not advance without organic chemistry; de Graaf could no more\r\ndiscover the amylolytic action of the pancreatic juice than Galvani\r\ncould invent wireless telegraphy. The physiologists had to wait till\r\nchemistry was ready to help them:--\r\n\r\n   \"Of course, while physical and chemical laws were still lost in\r\n   a chaos of undetermined facts, it was impossible that men should\r\n   analyse the phenomena of life: first, because these phenomena go\r\n   back to the laws of chemistry and physics; and next, because\r\n   they cannot be studied without the apparatus, instruments, and\r\n   all other methods of analysis that we owe to the laboratories of\r\n   the chemists and the physicists.\" (Cl. Bernard, _Phys. Opér._,\r\n   p. 61.)\r\n\r\nTherefore de Graaf failed, because he got no help from other sciences.\r\nBut it cannot be called failure; he must be contrasted with the men\r\nof his time, Lindanus and Bartholini, facts against theories, not with\r\nmen of this century. And Claude Bernard went back to de Graaf's method\r\nof the fistula, having to guide him the facts of chemistry observed by\r\nValentin, Tiedemann and Gmelin, and Eberlé. His work began in 1846,\r\nand the Académie des Sciences awarded a prize to it in 1850:--\r\n\r\n   \"Let this vague conception (the account of the pancreas given in\r\n   Johannes Müller's Text-book of Physiology) be compared with the\r\n   knowledge which we at present have of the several distinct\r\n   actions of the pancreatic juice, and of the predominant\r\n   importance of this fluid not only in intestinal digestion but in\r\n   digestion as a whole, and it will be at once seen what a great\r\n   advance has taken place in this matter since the early forties.\r\n   That advance we owe in the main to Bernard. Valentin, it is\r\n   true, had in 1844 not only inferred that the pancreatic juice\r\n   had an action on starch, but confirmed his view by actual\r\n   experiment with the juice expressed from the gland; and Eberlé\r\n   had suggested that the juice had some action on fat; but Bernard\r\n   at one stroke made clear its threefold action. He showed that it\r\n   on the one hand emulsified, and on the other hand split up, into\r\n   fatty acids and glycerine, the neutral fats; he clearly proved\r\n   that it had a powerful action on starch, converting it into\r\n   sugar; and lastly, he laid bare its remarkable action on proteid\r\n   matters.\" (Sir Michael Foster, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\nFinally came the discovery that the pancreas--apart from its\r\ninfluences on digestion--contributes its share, like the ductless\r\nglands, to the general chemistry of the body:--\r\n\r\n   \"It was discovered, a few years ago, by von Mering and\r\n   Minkowski, that if, instead of merely diverting its secretion,\r\n   the pancreas is bodily removed, the metabolic processes of the\r\n   organism, and especially the metabolism of carbo-hydrates, are\r\n   entirely deranged, the result being the production of permanent\r\n   diabetes. But if even a very small part of the gland is left\r\n   within the body, the carbo-hydrate metabolism remains unaltered,\r\n   and there is no diabetes. The small portion of the organ which\r\n   has been allowed to remain (and which need not even be left in\r\n   its proper place, but may be transplanted under the skin or\r\n   elsewhere) is sufficient, by the exchanges which go on between\r\n   it and the blood generally, to prevent those serious\r\n   consequences to the composition of the blood, and the general\r\n   constitution of the body, which result from the complete removal\r\n   of this organ.\" (Prof. Schäfer, 1894.)\r\n\r\nHere, in this present study of \"pancreatic diabetes,\" by Dr. Vaughan\r\nHarley and others, are facts as important as any that Bernard made\r\nout: in no way contradicting his work, but adding to it. The pancreas\r\nis no longer taken to be only a sort of salivary gland out of place:\r\nover and above the secretion that it pours into the intestines, it has\r\nan \"internal secretion,\" a constituent of the blood: it belongs not\r\nonly to the digestive system, but also, like the thyroid gland and the\r\nsuprarenal capsules, to the whole chemistry of the blood and the\r\ntissues. So far has physiology come, unaided by anatomy, from the\r\nfantastic notions of Lindanus and the men of his time: and has come\r\nevery inch of the way by the help of experiments on animals. Professor\r\nStarling's observations, on the chemical influence of the duodenal\r\nmucous membrane on the flow of pancreatic fluid, have advanced the\r\nsubject still further.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF BONE\r\n\r\nThe work of du Hamel proved that the periosteum is one chief agent in\r\nthe growth of bone. Before him, this great fact of physiology was\r\nunknown; for the experiments made by Anthony de Heide (1684), who\r\nstudied the production of callus in the bones of frogs, were wholly\r\nuseless, and serve only to show that men in his time had no clear\r\nunderstanding of the natural growth of bone. De Heide says of his\r\nexperiments:--\r\n\r\n   \"From these experiments it appears--_forsan probatur_--that\r\n   callus is generated by extravasated blood, whose fluid particles\r\n   being slowly exhaled, the residue takes the form of the bone:\r\n   which process may be further advanced by deciduous halitus from\r\n   the ends of the broken bone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Clopton Havers, in his _Osteologia Nova_ (London, 1691), goes so\r\nfar the wrong way that he attributes to the periosteum not the\r\nproduction of bone, but the prevention of over-production; the\r\nperiosteum, he says, is put round the shaft of a bone to compress it,\r\nlest it grow too large.\r\n\r\nDu Hamel's discovery (1739-1743) came out of a chance observation,\r\nmade by John Belchier,[4] that the bones of animals fed near\r\ndye-works were stained with the dye. Belchier therefore put a bird on\r\nfood mixed with madder, and found that its bones had taken up the\r\nstain. Then du Hamel studied the whole subject by a series of\r\nexperiments. To estimate the advance that he gave to physiology,\r\ncontrast de Heide's fanciful language with the title of one of du\r\nHamel's papers--_Quatrième Mémoire sur les Os, dans lequel on se\r\npropose de rapporter de nouvelles preuves qui établissent que les os\r\ncroissent en grosseur par l'addition de couches osseuses qui tirent\r\nleur origine du périoste, comme le corps ligneux des Arbres augmente\r\nen grosseur par l'addition de couches ligneuses qui se forment dans\r\nl'écorce._ Or take an example of du Hamel's method:--\r\n\r\n   \"Three pigs were destined to clear up my doubts. The first, six\r\n   weeks old, was fed for a month on ordinary food, with an ounce\r\n   daily of madder-juice--_garence grappe_--put in it. At the end\r\n   of the month, we stopped the juice, and fed the pig in the\r\n   ordinary way for six weeks, and then killed it. The marrow of\r\n   the bones was surrounded by a fairly thick layer of white bone:\r\n   this was the formation of bone during the first six weeks of\r\n   life, without madder. This ring of white bone was surrounded by\r\n   another zone of red bone: this was the formation of bone during\r\n   the administration of the madder. Finally, this red zone was\r\n   covered with a fairly thick layer of white bone: this was the\r\n   layer formed after the madder had been left off.... We shall\r\n   have no further difficulty in understanding whence transudes the\r\n   osseous juice that was thought necessary for the formation of\r\n   callus and the filling-up of the wounds of the bones, now we see\r\n   that it is the periosteum that fills up the wounds, or is made\r\n   thick round the fractures, and afterward becomes of the\r\n   consistence of cartilage, and at last acquires the hardness of\r\n   bones.\"\r\n\r\n  [4] \"An Account of the Bones of Animals being changed to a Red\r\n  Colour by Aliment only,\" by John Belchier, F.R.S., _Phil. Trans.\r\n  Roy. Soc._, 1735-36. There is a letter from Sir Hans Sloane, then\r\n  President of the Royal Society, to M. Geoffroy, member of the\r\n  French Academy:--\"M. Belchier, chirurgien, membre de cette\r\n  Société, dînant un jour chez un Teinturier qui travaille en Toiles\r\n  peintes, remarqua que dans un Porc frais qu'on avoit servi sur\r\n  table, et dont la chair étoit de bon goût, les os étoient rouges.\r\n  Il demanda la cause d'un effet si singulier, et on lui dit que ces\r\n  sortes de Teinturiers se servoient de la racine de Rubia\r\n  Tinctorum, ou garence, pour fixer les couleurs déjà imprimées sur\r\n  les Toiles de coton, qu'on appelle en Angleterre callicoes.\" This\r\n  passage of dye into the bones of animals had been noted so far\r\n  back as 1573, by Antoine Mizald, a doctor in Paris--_Erythrodanum,\r\n  vulgo rubia tinctorum, ossa pecudum rubenti et sandycino colore\r\n  imbuit._\r\n\r\nThese results, confirmed by Bazan (1746) and Boehmer (1751), were far\r\nbeyond anything that had yet been known about the periosteum. But the\r\ngrowth of bone is a very complex process: the naked eye sees only the\r\ngrosser changes that come with it; and du Hamel's ingenious comparison\r\nbetween the periosteum and the bark of trees was too simple to be\r\nexact. Therefore his work was opposed by Haller, and by Dethleef,\r\nHaller's pupil: and the great authority of Haller's name, and the\r\ndifficulties lying beyond du Hamel's plain facts, brought about a long\r\nperiod of uncertainty. Bordenave (1756) found reasons for supporting\r\nHaller; and Fougeroux (1760) supported du Hamel. Thus men came to\r\nstudy the whole subject with more accuracy--the growth in length, as\r\nwell as the growth in thickness; the medullary cavity, the development\r\nof bone, the nutrition and absorption of bone. Among those who took up\r\nthe work were Bichat, Hunter, Troja, and Cruveilhier; and they\r\nrecognised the surgical aspect of these researches in physiology.\r\nAfter them, the periosteal growth of bone became, as it were, a part\r\nof the principles of surgery. From this point of view of practice,\r\nissued the experiments made by Syme (1837) and Stanley (1849): which\r\nproved the importance of the epiphysial cartilages for the growth of\r\nthe bones in length, and the risk of interfering with these\r\ncartilages in operations on the joints of children. Finally, with the\r\nrise of anæsthetics and of the antiseptic method, came the work of\r\nOllier, of Lyon, whose good influence on the treatment of these cases\r\ncan hardly be over-estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAs with the circulatory system, so with the nervous system, the work\r\nof Galen was centuries ahead of its time. Before him, Aristotle, who\r\ntwice refers to experiments on animals, had observed the brain during\r\nlife: for he says, \"In no animal has the blood any feeling when it is\r\ntouched, any more than the excretions; nor has the brain, or the\r\nmarrow, any feeling, when it is touched\": but there is reason for\r\nbelieving that he neither recognised the purpose of the brain, nor\r\nunderstood the distribution of the nerves. Galen, by the help of the\r\nexperimental method, founded the physiology of the nervous system:--\r\n\r\n   \"Galen's method of procedure was totally different to that of an\r\n   anatomist alone. He first reviewed the anatomical position, and\r\n   by dissection showed the continuity of the nervous system, both\r\n   central and peripheral, and also that some bundles of nerve\r\n   fibres were distributed to the skin, others to the muscles.\r\n   Later, by process of the physiological experiment of dividing\r\n   such bundles of fibres, he showed that the former were sensory\r\n   fibres and the latter motor fibres. He further traced the nerves\r\n   to their origins in the spinal cord, and their terminations as\r\n   aforesaid. From these observations and experiments he was able\r\n   to deduce the all-important fact that different nerve-roots\r\n   supplied different groups of muscles and different areas of the\r\n   skin.... An excellent illustration of his method, and of the\r\n   fact that we ought not to treat symptoms, but the causes of\r\n   symptoms, is shown very clearly in one of the cases which Galen\r\n   records as having come under his care. He tells us that he was\r\n   consulted by a certain sophist called Pausanias, who had a\r\n   severe degree of anæsthesia of the little and ring fingers. For\r\n   this loss of sensation, etc., the medical men who attended him\r\n   applied ointments of various kinds to the affected fingers; but\r\n   Galen, considering that that was a wrong principle, inquired\r\n   into the history, and found that while the patient was driving\r\n   in his chariot he had accidentally fallen out and struck his\r\n   spine at the junction of the cervical and dorsal regions. Galen\r\n   recognised that he had to do with a traumatism affecting the\r\n   eighth cervical and first dorsal nerve; therefore, he says, he\r\n   ordered that the ointments should be taken off the hand and\r\n   placed over the spinal column, so as to treat the really\r\n   affected part, and not apply remedies to merely the referred\r\n   seat of pain.\"[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] From an address on Galen, given by Sir Victor Horsley before\r\n  the Medical Society of the Middlesex Hospital. See _Middlesex\r\n  Hospital Journal_, May 1899.\r\n\r\nGalen, by this sort of work, laid the foundations of physiology; but\r\nthe men who came after him let his facts be overwhelmed by fantastic\r\ndoctrines: all through the ages, from Galen to the Renaissance, no\r\ngreat advance was made toward the interpretation of the nervous\r\nsystem. Long after the Renaissance, his authority still held good; his\r\nghost was not laid even by Paracelsus and Vesalius, it haunted the\r\nmedical profession so late as the middle of the seventeenth century;\r\nbut the men who worshipped his name missed the whole meaning of his\r\nwork. This long neglect of the experimental method left such a gap in\r\nthe history of physiology, that Sir Charles Bell seems to take up the\r\nexperimental study of the nervous system at the point where Galen had\r\nstopped short; we go from the time of Commodus to the time of George\r\nthe Third, and there is Bell, as it were, putting the finishing touch\r\nto Galen's facts. It is true that experiments had been made on the\r\nnervous system by many men; but a dead weight of theories kept down\r\nthe whole subject. For a good instance, how imagination hindered\r\nscience, there is the following list, made by Dr. Risien Russell, of\r\ntheories about the cerebellum:--\r\n\r\n   \"Galen was of opinion that the cerebellum must be the originator\r\n   of a large amount of vital force. After him, and up to the time\r\n   of Willis, the prevalent idea seems to have been that it was the\r\n   seat of memory; while Bourillon considered it the seat of\r\n   instinct and intelligence. Willis supposed that it presided over\r\n   involuntary movements and organic functions; and this view,\r\n   though refuted by Haller, continued in the ascendency for some\r\n   time. Some believed strongly in its influence on the functions\r\n   of organic life; and according to some, diseases of the\r\n   cerebellum appeared to tell on the movements of the heart....\r\n   Haller believed it to be the seat of sensations, as well as the\r\n   source of voluntary power; and there were many supporters of the\r\n   theory that the cerebellum was the seat of the sensory centres.\r\n   Renzi considered this organ the nervous centre by which we\r\n   perceive the reality of the external world, and direct and fix\r\n   our senses on the things round us. Gall, and later Broussais,\r\n   and others, held that this organ presided over the instinct of\r\n   reproduction, or the propensity to love; while Carus regarded it\r\n   as the seat of the will also. Rolando looked on it as the source\r\n   of origin of all movements. Jessen adduced arguments in favour\r\n   of its being the central organ of feeling, or of the soul, and\r\n   the principal seat of the sensations.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain, from this list, that physiology had become obscured by\r\nfanciful notions of no practical value. If a better understanding of\r\nthe nervous system could have been got without experiments on\r\nanimals, why had men to wait so long for it? The Italian anatomists\r\nhad long ago given them all the anatomy that was needed to make a\r\nbeginning; the hospitals, and practice, had given them many hundred\r\nyears of clinical facts; nervous diseases and head injuries were\r\ncommon enough in the Middle Ages; and by the time of Ambroise Paré, if\r\nnot before, _post-mortem_ examinations were allowed. The one thing\r\nwanted was the experimental method; and, for want of it, the science\r\nof the nervous system stood still. Experiments had been made; but the\r\nsteady, general, unbiassed use of this method had been lost sight of,\r\nand men were more occupied with logic and with philosophy.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1811, came Sir Charles Bell's work. If any one would see how\r\ngreat was the need of experiments on animals for the interpretation of\r\nthe nervous system, let him contrast the physiology of the eighteenth\r\ncentury with that one experiment by Bell which enabled him to say, \"I\r\nnow saw the meaning of the double connection of the nerves with the\r\nspinal marrow.\" It is true that this method is but a part of the\r\nscience of medicine; that experiment and experience ought to go\r\ntogether like the convexity and the concavity of a curve. But it is\r\ntrue also that men owe their deliverance from ignorance about the\r\nnervous system more to experiments on animals than to any other method\r\nof observing facts.\r\n\r\n1. _Sir Charles Bell_ (1778-1842)\r\n\r\nThe great authority of Sir Charles Bell has been quoted a thousand\r\ntimes against all experiments on animals:--\r\n\r\n   \"Experiments have never been the means of discovery; and a\r\n   survey of what has been attempted of late years in physiology,\r\n   will prove that the opening of living animals has done more to\r\n   perpetuate error than to confirm the just views taken from the\r\n   study of anatomy and natural motions.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote, of course, in the days before bacteriology, before\r\nanæsthetics; he had in his mind neither inoculations, nor any\r\nobservations made under chloroform or ether, but just \"the opening of\r\nliving animals.\" He had also in his mind, and always in it, a great\r\ndislike against the school of Magendie. Let all that pass; our only\r\nconcern here is to know whether these words are true of his own work.\r\n\r\nThey occur in a paper, _On the Motions of the Eye, in Illustration of\r\nthe Uses of the Muscles and Nerves of the Orbit_; communicated by Sir\r\nHumphry Davy to the Royal Society, and read March 20, 1823.[6] This\r\nessay was one of a series of papers on the nervous system, presented\r\nto the Royal Society during the years 1821-1829. In 1830, having\r\nalready published four of these papers under the title, _The\r\nExposition of the Nervous System_, Bell published all six of them,\r\nunder the title, _The Nervous System of the Human Body_.\r\n\r\n  [6] This paper includes an _Experimental Enquiry into the Action\r\n  of these Muscles_, giving an account of an experiment on the eye.\r\n\r\nIn his Preface to this book (1830) he quotes the earliest of all his\r\nprinted writings on the nervous system, a pamphlet, printed in 1811,\r\nunder the title, _An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain, Submitted for\r\nthe Observation of the Authors Friends_. We have therefore two\r\nstatements of his work, one in 1811, the other in 1823 and 1830. The\r\nfirst of them was written when his work was still new before his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThose who say that experiments did not help Bell in his great\r\ndiscovery--the difference between the anterior and the posterior\r\nnerve-roots--appeal to certain passages in the 1830 volume:--\r\n\r\n   \"In a foreign review of my former papers, the results have been\r\n   considered as a further proof in favour of experiments. They\r\n   are, on the contrary, deductions from anatomy; and I have had\r\n   recourse to experiments, not to form my own opinions, but to\r\n   impress them upon others. It must be my apology that my utmost\r\n   efforts of persuasion were lost, while I urged my statements on\r\n   the grounds of anatomy alone. I have made few experiments; they\r\n   have been simple and easily performed, and I hope are\r\n   decisive....\r\n\r\n   \"My conceptions of this matter arose by inference from the\r\n   anatomical structure; so that the few experiments which have\r\n   been made were directed only to the verification of the\r\n   fundamental principles on which the system is established.\"\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the 1811 pamphlet, the opponents of all experiments\r\non animals might claim Sir Charles Bell on their side. But while his\r\nwork was still a new thing, he spoke in another way of it:--\r\n\r\n   \"I found that injury done to the anterior portion of the spinal\r\n   marrow convulsed the animal more certainly than injury to the\r\n   posterior portion; but I found it difficult to make the\r\n   experiment without injuring both portions.\r\n\r\n   \"Next, considering that the spinal nerves have a double root,\r\n   and being of opinion that the properties of the nerves are\r\n   derived from their connections with the parts of the brain, _I\r\n   thought that I had an opportunity of putting my opinion to the\r\n   test of experiment, and of proving at the same time_ that nerves\r\n   of different endowments were in the same cord (nerve-trunk) and\r\n   held together by the same sheath.\r\n\r\n   \"On laying bare the roots of the spinal nerves, I found that I\r\n   could cut across the posterior fasciculus of nerves, which took\r\n   its origin from the posterior portion of the spinal marrow,\r\n   without convulsing the muscles of the back; but that on touching\r\n   the anterior fasciculus with the point of the knife, the muscles\r\n   of the back were immediately convulsed.\r\n\r\n   \"_Such were my reasons for concluding_ that the cerebrum and\r\n   cerebellum were parts distinct in function, and that every nerve\r\n   possessing a double function obtained that by having a double\r\n   root. _I now saw the meaning_ of the double connection of the\r\n   nerves with the spinal marrow; and also the cause of that\r\n   seeming intricacy in the connections of nerves throughout their\r\n   course, which were not double at their origins.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reconcile the 1830 sentences with this vivid\r\npersonal account of himself; _I had an opportunity of putting my\r\nopinion to the test of experiment ... an opportunity of proving ...\r\nSuch were my reasons for concluding ... I now saw...._ It is just what\r\nall men of science say of their experiments: the very phrase of\r\nArchimedes, and Asellius, and de Graaf. If Sir Charles Bell had been\r\nworking at the facts of chemistry or of botany, who would have doubted\r\nthe meaning of these words?\r\n\r\nThis same inconsistency of sentences occurs elsewhere in his _Nervous\r\nSystem of the Human Body_. In one place he says that he has made few\r\nexperiments: _They have been simple, and easily performed, and I hope\r\nare decisive._ In another he says: \"_After making several experiments\r\non the cerebrum and cerebellum, I laid the question of their functions\r\nentirely aside_, and confined myself to the investigation of the\r\nspinal marrow and the nerves; _a subject which I found more within my\r\npower_, and which forms the substance of the present volume.\"\r\n\r\nNext, take his account of the cranial nerves:--\r\n\r\n   \"It was necessary to know, in the first place, whether the\r\n   phenomena exhibited on injuring the separate roots corresponded\r\n   with what was suggested by their anatomy....\r\n\r\n   \"Here a difficulty arose. An opinion prevailed that ganglions\r\n   were intended to cut off sensation; and every one of these\r\n   nerves, which I supposed were the instruments of sensation, have\r\n   ganglions on their roots. Some very decided experiment was\r\n   necessary to overturn this dogma. (Account of the experiment.)\r\n   By pursuing the inquiry, it was found that a ganglionic nerve is\r\n   the sole organ of sensation in the head and face: ganglions were\r\n   therefore no hindrance to sensation; and thus my opinion was\r\n   confirmed.... _It now became obvious_ why the third, sixth, and\r\n   ninth nerves of the encephalon were single nerves in their\r\n   roots....\r\n\r\n   \"Observing that there was a portion of the fifth nerve which did\r\n   not enter the ganglion of that nerve, and being assured of the\r\n   fact by the concurring testimony of anatomists, I conceived that\r\n   the fifth nerve was in fact the uppermost nerve of the spine....\r\n   This opinion was confirmed by experiment.... (Account of an\r\n   experiment on the dead body.) On dividing the root of the nerve\r\n   in a living animal, the jaw fell relaxed. Thus its functions are\r\n   no longer matter of doubt: it is at once a muscular nerve and a\r\n   nerve of sensibility. And thus the opinion is confirmed, that\r\n   the fifth nerve is to the head what the spinal nerves are to the\r\n   other parts of the body, in respect to sensation and volition.\"\r\n\r\nThe value of the experimental method could hardly be stated in more\r\nemphatic words. He supposed something, conceived it, had an opinion\r\nabout it. Anatomy had suggested something to him. He put his opinion\r\nto the test of phenomena, that is to say, to the test of visible\r\nfacts; and then his opinion was confirmed. As with the spinal\r\nnerve-roots, so with the fifth cranial nerve--his work was successful,\r\nbecause he followed the way of experiment.\r\n\r\nHe was by nature of a most complex and sensitive temperament, full of\r\ncontrary forces--one man in 1811, another in 1830. In 1811 he wrote,\r\n_I now saw the meaning of the double connection of the nerves_; in\r\n1830 he had come to hate the _stupid sterile materialism_ of the\r\nFrench school: he beheld anatomy falling behind physiology, and his\r\nWindmill Street school perishing to make way for the Hospital schools\r\nand for the University of London. He was before everything else a\r\ngreat anatomist: he stood up for the honour of anatomy against the new\r\nphysiology, and for the honour of the Monroes and the Hunters against\r\nMagendie: he hated the notion that any man should proceed to\r\nexperiments on function till the very last secrets had been got out of\r\nstructure. He died a few years afterward. The 1830 writings are his\r\nlast stand for the defence of his country, his school, and his beloved\r\nanatomy, against the methods of Magendie; who said of himself, \"I am a\r\nmere street scavenger, _chiffonier_, of science. With my hook in my\r\nhand and my basket on my back, I go about the streets of science,\r\ncollecting what I find.\"\r\n\r\nThis open conflict between Bell's first and last thoughts is a part of\r\nhis character: he was brilliant, impulsive, changeable, inconsistent;\r\nand, what is more important, his honour kept him from trying to evade\r\nthis trumpery charge of inconsistency; and he reprinted the 1811\r\nPreface in the book that he published in 1830. Doubtless he would have\r\npicked his words more carefully if he had foreseen that one of the\r\n1830 sentences would be wrested out of its place in his life's work,\r\nand used as false evidence against the very method that he followed.\r\n\r\nHis observations on the cranial nerves brought about an immediate\r\nchange in the practice of surgery:--\r\n\r\n   \"Up to the time that Sir Charles Bell made his experiments on\r\n   the nerves of the face, it was the common custom of surgeons to\r\n   divide the facial nerve for the relief of neuralgia, _tic\r\n   douleureux_; whereas it exercises, and was proved by Sir Charles\r\n   Bell to exercise, no influence over sensation, and its division\r\n   consequently for the relief of pain was a useless operation.\"\r\n   (Sir J. Erichsen.)\r\n\r\n   The relation of Magendie's work on the nerve-roots to Bell's\r\n   work need not be considered here. The exact dates of Bell's\r\n   observations are given by one of his pupils in the Preface to\r\n   the 1830 volume. Magendie finally proved the sensory nature of\r\n   the posterior nerve-roots: \"The exact and full proof which he\r\n   brought forward of the truth which Charles Bell had divined\r\n   rather than demonstrated, that the anterior and posterior roots\r\n   of spinal nerves have essentially different functions--a truth\r\n   which is the very foundation of the physiology of the nervous\r\n   system--is enough by itself to mark him as a great\r\n   physiologist.\" (Sir M. Foster, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\n2. _Marshall Hall_ (1790-1857)\r\n\r\nReflex action had been studied long before the time of Marshall Hall.\r\nThe Hon. Robert Boyle (1663) had observed the movements and actions of\r\ndecapitated vipers, flies, silkworms, and butterflies. Similar\r\nobservations were made on frogs, eels, and other lower animals, by\r\nRedi, Woodward, Stuart, Le Gallois, and Sir Gilbert Blane. According\r\nto Richet, it was Willis who first gave the name _reflex_ to these\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that these first studies of reflex action did much\r\nfor physiology. But the following translation from Prochaska (1800)\r\nshows how they cleared the way for Marshall Hall's work, by the proof\r\nthat they gave of the liberation of nervous energy in the spinal\r\ncord:--\r\n\r\n   \"These movements of animals after decapitation must needs be by\r\n   consent and commerce betwixt the spinal nerves. For a\r\n   decapitated frog, if it be pricked, not only draws away the part\r\n   that is pricked, but also creeps and jumps; which cannot happen\r\n   but by consent betwixt the sensory nerves and the motor nerves.\r\n   The seat of which consent must needs be in the spinal cord, the\r\n   only remaining portion of the sensorium. _And this reflexion of\r\n   sensory impressions into motor impressions is not accomplished\r\n   in obedience to physical laws alone--wherein the angle of\r\n   reflexion is equal to the angle of incidence, and reaction to\r\n   action--but it follows special laws as it were written by Nature\r\n   on the spinal cord, which we can know only by their effects, but\r\n   cannot fathom with the understanding._ But the general law,\r\n   whereby the sensorium reflects sensory impressions into motor\r\n   impressions, is the preservation of ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not possible, in 1800, to go further, or to put the facts of\r\nreflex action more clearly: but this fine sentence gives no hint of\r\nthe truth that guided Marshall Hall--that the \"consent and commerce\"\r\nof reflex action are to be found at definite points or levels in the\r\nspinal cord; that the cord no more \"works as a whole\" than the brain.\r\nThe greatness of Marshall Hall's work lies in his recognition of the\r\ndivisional action of the cord: he proved the existence of definite\r\ncentres in it, he discovered the facts of spinal localisation, and\r\nthus foreshadowed the discovery of cerebral localisation. In his\r\nearlier writings (1823-33) he showed how the movements of the trunk\r\nand of the limbs are only one sort of reflex action; how the larynx,\r\nthe pharynx, and the sphincter muscles, all act by the \"consent and\r\ncommerce\" of the spinal cord. Later, in 1837, he demonstrated the\r\ncourse of nerve-impulses along the cord from one level to another, the\r\nresults of direct stimulation of the cord, and other facts of spinal\r\nlocalisation. He noted the different effects of opium and of\r\nstrychnine on reflex action; and he extended the doctrines of reflex\r\naction beyond physiology to the convulsive movements of the body in\r\ncertain diseases.\r\n\r\n3. _Flourens_ (1794-1867)\r\n\r\nBeside his work on the nervous system, Flourens studied the periosteal\r\ngrowth of bone, and the action of chloroform;[7] but he is best known\r\nby his experiments on the respiratory centre and the cerebellum. The\r\nmen who interpreted the nervous system followed the anatomical course\r\nof that system: first the nerve-roots, then the cord, then the medulla\r\noblongata and the cerebellum, and last the cerebral hemispheres; a\r\nsteady upward advance, from the observation of decapitated insects to\r\nthe localisation of centres in the human brain. Flourens, by his work\r\non the medulla oblongata, localised the respiratory centre, the\r\nnerve-cells for the reflex movements of respiration:--\r\n\r\n   \"M. Flourens a circonscrit ce centre avec une scrupuleuse\r\n   précision, et lui a donné le nom de noeud vital\" (Cl. Bernard.)\r\n\r\n  [7] When Flourens died, Claude Bernard was appointed to his place\r\n  in the French Academy; and, in the _Discours de Reception_ (May\r\n  27, 1869), said, \"It is twenty-two years since the discovery of\r\n  anæsthesia by ether came to us from the New World, and spread\r\n  rapidly over Europe. M. Flourens was the first man who showed that\r\n  chloroform is more active than ether.\"\r\n\r\nAfterward came the discovery of cardiac and other centres in the same\r\nportion of the nervous system. Flourens also showed that the\r\ncerebellum is concerned with the equilibration of the body, and with\r\nthe coordination of muscular movements; that an animal, a few days\r\nold, deprived of sensation and consciousness by removal of the\r\ncerebral hemispheres, was yet able to stand and move forward, but,\r\nwhen the cerebellum was removed, its muscles lost all co-ordinate\r\naction. (_Recherches Expérimentales_, Paris, 1842.) And from his work,\r\nand the work of those who followed him, on the semicircular canals of\r\nthe internal ear, came the evidence that these minute structures are\r\nthe terminal organs of equilibration: that as the special senses have\r\ntheir terminal apparatus and their central apparatus, so the\r\nsemicircular canals and the cerebellum are the terminal apparatus and\r\nthe central apparatus of the sense of equilibrium.\r\n\r\n4. _Claude Bernard_ (1813-1878)\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the vaso-motor nerves, and of the control of the\r\nnervous system over the calibre of the arteries, was made by Claude\r\nBernard at the outset of his work on the influence of the nervous\r\nsystem on the temperature.[8] The evidence of Professor Sharpey before\r\nthe Royal Commission of 1875 shows how things had been misjudged,\r\nbefore Bernard's time, in the light of \"views taken from the Study of\r\nAnatomy and Natural Motions\":--\r\n\r\n   \"I remember that Sir Charles Bell gave the increased size of the\r\n   vessels in blushing, and their fulness of blood, as an example\r\n   of the increased action of the arteries in driving on the blood.\r\n   It turns out to be just the reverse, inasmuch as it is owing to\r\n   a paralysis of the nerves governing the muscular coats of the\r\n   arteries.\"\r\n\r\n  [8] A full account of this discovery, and of its relation to the\r\n  experiments of Brown Séquard, Waller, and Budge, is given by Sir\r\n  Michael Foster in his life of Claude Bernard; and the question of\r\n  priority between Bernard and Brown Séquard need not be considered\r\n  here, for the experimental method was the only way open to either\r\n  of them. For an account of the work done, before Bernard, in this\r\n  field of physiology, see Prof. Stirling's admirable and learned\r\n  monograph, _Some Apostles of Physiology_ (Waterlow & Sons, London,\r\n  1902), p. 104.\r\n\r\nClaude Bernard's first account of his work was communicated to the\r\nSociété de Biologie in December 1851. The following description is\r\ntaken from his _Leçons de Physiologie Opératoire_:--\r\n\r\n   \"I will remind you how I was led to the discovery of the\r\n   vaso-motor nerves. Starting from the clinical observation, made\r\n   long ago, that in paralysed limbs you find at one time an\r\n   increase of cold, and at another an increase of heat, I thought\r\n   this contradiction might be explained by supposing that, side by\r\n   side with the general action of the nervous system, the\r\n   sympathetic nerve might have the function of presiding over the\r\n   production of heat; that is to say, that in the case where the\r\n   paralysed limb was chilled, I supposed the sympathetic nerve to\r\n   be paralysed, as well as the motor nerves; while in the\r\n   paralysed limbs that were not chilled, the sympathetic nerve had\r\n   retained its function, the systemic nerves alone having been\r\n   attacked.\r\n\r\n   \"This was a theory, that is to say, an idea leading me to make\r\n   experiments; and for these experiments I must find a sympathetic\r\n   nerve-trunk of sufficient size, going to some organ that was\r\n   easy to observe, and must divide this trunk to see what would\r\n   happen to the heat-supply of the organ. You know that the\r\n   rabbit's ear, and the cervical sympathetic nerve of this animal,\r\n   offered us the required conditions. So I divided the nerve; and\r\n   immediately my experiment gave the lie direct to my theory--_Je\r\n   coupai donc ce filet et aussitôt l'expérience donna à mon\r\n   hypothèse le plus éclatant démenti_. I had thought that the\r\n   section of the nerve would suppress the function of nutrition,\r\n   of calorification, over which the sympathetic system had been\r\n   supposed to preside, and would cause the hollow of the ear to\r\n   become chilled; and here was just the opposite, a very warm ear,\r\n   with great dilatation of its vessels.\r\n\r\n   \"I need not remind you how I made haste to abandon my first\r\n   theory, and gave myself to the study of this new state of\r\n   things. And you know that here was the starting-point of all my\r\n   researches into the vaso-motor and thermic system; and the study\r\n   of this subject is become one of the richest fields of\r\n   experimental physiology.\"\r\n\r\nWaller, in 1853, studied the vaso-motor centre in the spinal cord; and\r\nSchiff, in 1856, found evidence of the existence of two kinds of\r\nvaso-motor nerves--those that constrict the vessels, and those that\r\ndilate them. This view was finally established in 1858 by Claude\r\nBernard's experiments on the chorda tympani and the submaxillary\r\ngland.\r\n\r\nThe _Leçons de Physiologie Opératoire_ were published in 1879. Twenty\r\nyears later, Sir Michael Foster says of Bernard's work:--\r\n\r\n   \"It is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of these\r\n   labours of Bernard on the vaso-motor nerves, since it is almost\r\n   impossible to exaggerate the influence which our knowledge of\r\n   the vaso-motor system, springing as it does from Bernard's\r\n   researches as from its fount and origin, has exerted, is\r\n   exerting, and in widening measure will continue to exert, on all\r\n   our physiological and pathological conceptions, on medical\r\n   practice, and on the conduct of human life. There is hardly a\r\n   physiological discussion of any width in which we do not sooner\r\n   or later come on vaso-motor questions. Whatever part of\r\n   physiology we touch, be it the work done by a muscle, be it the\r\n   various kinds of secretive labour, be it the insurance of the\r\n   brain's well-being in the midst of the hydrostatic vicissitudes\r\n   to which the changes of daily life subject it, be it that\r\n   maintenance of bodily temperature which is a condition of the\r\n   body's activity; in all these, as in many other things, we find\r\n   vaso-motor factors intervening. And if, passing the insecure and\r\n   wavering line which parts health from illness, we find ourselves\r\n   dealing with inflammation, or with fever, or with any of the\r\n   disordered physiological processes which constitute disease, we\r\n   shall find, whatever be the tissue specially affected by the\r\n   morbid conditions, that vaso-motor influences have to be taken\r\n   into account. The idea of vaso-motor action is woven as a\r\n   dominant thread into all the physiological and pathological\r\n   doctrines of to-day; attempt to draw out that thread, and all\r\n   that would be left would appear as a tangled heap.\"\r\n\r\n5. _Cerebral Localisation_\r\n\r\nFinally, moving upward along the anatomy of the nervous system,\r\nphysiology came to study the motor-centres and special sense-centres\r\nof the cerebral hemispheres. The year 1861 may fairly be said to mark\r\nthe beginning of the discovery of these centres, when Broca, at a\r\nmeeting of the Anthropological Society of Paris, heard Aubertin's\r\npaper on the connection between the frontal convolutions and the\r\nfaculty of speech. But, of course, some sort of belief in cerebral\r\nlocalisation had been in the air long before Broca's time. Willis\r\n(1621-1675), who was contemporary with Sir Isaac Newton, had written\r\nof the brain as though its convolutions, or \"cranklings\" as he called\r\nthem, showed that its work was departmental:--\r\n\r\n   \"As the animal spirits for the various acts of imagination and\r\n   memory ought to be moved within certain and distinct limits, or\r\n   bounded places, and these motions to be often iterated or\r\n   repeated through the same tracts or paths, for that reason these\r\n   manifold convolutions and infoldings of the brain are required\r\n   for these divers manners of ordinations of the animal\r\n   spirits--to wit, that in these cells or storehouses, severally\r\n   placed, might be kept the species of sensitive things, and as\r\n   occasion serves, may be taken from thence.\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] For an account of Willis' work on the nervous system, see Sir\r\n  Victor Horsley's _Fullerian Lectures_, 1891. Willis was the first,\r\n  or one of the first, to recognise the fact that the cerebral\r\n  ventricles are nothing more than lymph-cavities.\r\n\r\nAnd Gall, a century after Willis, had collected and published, in\r\nsupport of his system of phrenology, many cases and _post-mortem_\r\nexaminations showing the differentiation of the work of the brain.\r\nGall is a warning for all time against the dangers of deduction; he\r\nhad but one idea, and he drove it to death; but the clinical and\r\npathological facts which he amassed, in the hope of establishing a set\r\nof doctrines out of all relation to facts, are as true now as ever;\r\nand, if he had been content to go the way of induction, and to set\r\nhimself to the accumulation of facts, he might have become a great\r\nphysiologist. In his knowledge of the anatomy of the brain, and in the\r\ndissection of the brain, he was far ahead of the men of his time; but\r\nhe followed his own imaginings, and left nothing that could last,\r\nexcept those cases and pathological instances that are buried in the\r\nruins of his system. But there they are, and are still of value. For\r\nexample, Gall's case of loss of speech, after an injury involving the\r\nspeech-centres, ought to have commanded the attention of all\r\nphysiologists: but it came to nothing, because he used it to support\r\nhis doctrine of organs and bumps, and it shared the fate of that\r\ndoctrine. Phrenology is gone past recall; it died of that congenital\r\ndisease, the deductive fallacy; but there was a time when it might\r\nhave been turned to the service of science.\r\n\r\nThe excitement that Gall aroused by the spread of his ideas shows that\r\nsome belief in cerebral centres was waiting for development. All men\r\nare by nature phrenologists; the commonplace excuses that are offered\r\nfor lapses of memory, venial offences, and inherited weaknesses, all\r\nappeal to the comfortable notion that the offender is not wholly\r\nperverted, and that some very small and strictly localised group of\r\ncells is at fault. And it is probable that the physiology of the\r\ncentral nervous system, with its present strong tendency toward\r\npsychology, will some day be back, at a far higher level, above the\r\npoint where phrenology went wrong. As Mme. de Staël said, _L'esprit\r\nhumain fait progrès toujours, mais c'est progrès en spirale_. But the\r\nquestion, whether the general desire for a rational system of\r\npsychology will ever commend itself to physiology, belongs to the\r\nfuture. All that is of present concern is the steady, continuous, and\r\nsuccessful advance, by the way of induction, and by the help of\r\nexperiments on animals, toward a clear and accurate statement of the\r\ndepartmental work of the brain.\r\n\r\nIt is one of many instances how science and practice work together,\r\nthat the modern study of these centres began not in experiment but in\r\nexperience. The first centres that were thus studied were the\r\nspeech-centres; and the observation of them arose out of the cases\r\nrecorded by Bouillard in 1825, and Dax in 1836. Clinical observation,\r\nand _post-mortem_ examination, found the speech-centres; physiological\r\nexperiments had nothing to do with it; and phrenology had, as it\r\nwere, found them, and then lost them. But at once, so soon as practice\r\ngave the word to science, physiology set to work. These clinical facts\r\nhad been there all the time; loss of speech had gone with disease or\r\ninjury of \"Broca's convolution\" ever since man had been on the earth,\r\nand nobody had seen the significance of this sequence. Then, after\r\n1861, everything was changed; and in a few years physiology had mapped\r\nout a large part of the surface of the brain, and had charted the\r\nmotor-centres.\r\n\r\nThe story of Broca's convolution is told in Hamilton's _Text-Book of\r\nPathology_:--\r\n\r\n   \"In 1825, Bouillard collected a series of cases to show that the\r\n   faculty of speech resided in the frontal lobes. In the year 1836\r\n   M. Dax, in a paper read to the Medical Congress of Montpellier,\r\n   stated as a result of his researches that, where speech was lost\r\n   from cerebral causes, he believed the lesion was invariably\r\n   found in the left cerebral hemisphere, and that the accompanying\r\n   paralysis of the right side of the body is consequent upon this.\r\n   This paper for long lay buried in the annals of medical\r\n   literature, but was unearthed years afterwards by his son, and\r\n   presented to the French Academy. Bouillard's views were also\r\n   disinterred by Aubertin, and in the year 1861 were brought by\r\n   him before the notice of the Anthropological Society of Paris.\r\n   Broca, who was present at the meeting, had a patient under his\r\n   care at the time who had been aphasic (without power of speech)\r\n   for twenty-one years, and who was in an almost moribund state.\r\n   The autopsy proved of great interest, as it was found that the\r\n   lesion was confined to the left side of the brain, and to what\r\n   we now call the third frontal convolution. Broca was struck with\r\n   the coincidence; and when a similar case came under his care\r\n   afterwards, unaware of what had been done by Dax, he postulated\r\n   the conclusion that the integrity of the third frontal\r\n   convolution, and perhaps also part of the second, is essential\r\n   to speech. In a subsequent series of fifteen typical cases\r\n   examined, it was found that the lesion had destroyed, among\r\n   other parts, the posterior part of the third frontal in\r\n   fourteen. In the fifteenth case the destruction had taken place\r\n   in the island of Reil and the temporal lobe.\"\r\n\r\nAfter 1861, physiology took the lead, and kept it. But, through all\r\nthe work, science and practice have been held together; the facts of\r\nexperimental physiology have been and are tested, every inch of the\r\nway, by the facts of medicine, surgery, and pathology. The infinite\r\nminuteness and complexity of the investigation, and its innumerable\r\nside-issues, are past all telling. They who are doing the work, in\r\nscience and in practice, have always had in their thoughts the fear of\r\nfallacies in the interpretation of these highest forms of life. Sir\r\nWilliam Gowers, fourteen years ago, wrote as follows of the earlier\r\nworkers:--\r\n\r\n   \"Doubt was formerly entertained as to the existence of\r\n   differentiation of function in different parts of the cortex,\r\n   but recent researches have established the existence of a\r\n   differentiation which has almost revolutionised cerebral\r\n   physiology, and has vastly extended the range of cerebral\r\n   diagnosis. The first step of the new discovery was constituted\r\n   by the clinical and pathological observations of Hughlings\r\n   Jackson, which suggested the existence, on each side of the\r\n   fissure of Rolando, of special centres for the movements of the\r\n   leg, arm, and face. These observations led to the experiments of\r\n   Ferner, which resulted in the demonstration of the existence in\r\n   the cortex of the lower animals of well-defined regions,\r\n   stimulation of which caused separate movements, or evidence of\r\n   special sense excitation, while the destruction of the same\r\n   parts caused indications of a loss of the corresponding\r\n   function. Hence he came to the conclusion that these regions\r\n   constitute actual motor and sensory centres. Ferrier had,\r\n   however, been anticipated in many of these results by two German\r\n   experimenters, Fritsch and Hitzig, whose results, differing a\r\n   little in detail, correspond closely in their general\r\n   significance. Many other investigations of the same character\r\n   have since been made, of which those of Munk are especially\r\n   important. The original observations of Hughlings Jackson left\r\n   little doubt that the general facts, learned from experiments on\r\n   animals, are true of man; and this conclusion has been to a\r\n   large extent confirmed by pathological and clinical observations\r\n   directed to the verification on man of the pathological results.\r\n   To this verification the labours of Charcot and his coadjutors\r\n   have largely contributed. But the verification has already made\r\n   it probable that some differences exist between the brain of man\r\n   and that of higher animals (even of monkeys), and that the\r\n   conclusions from the latter cannot be simply transferred to the\r\n   former.\"\r\n\r\nMany and great difficulties, beyond this danger of the fallacy of\r\n\"simple transference,\" beset every step of the work: it required the\r\nright use of the most delicate and susceptible instruments and tests,\r\nand the right understanding of anatomy, microscopic anatomy,\r\ncomparative anatomy, organic chemistry, electricity, and physics:\r\nevery moment of advance must be guarded, every word must be weighed.\r\nAmong the earlier difficulties, was the failure of almost all the\r\nphysiologists, before Hitzig, to produce muscular action by excitation\r\nof the cerebral cortex. Longet, Magendie, Flourens, Matteuci, Van Deen,\r\nWeber, Budge, and Schiff, had all failed. Hitzig (_Untersuchungen\r\nüber das Gehirn_, Berlin, 1874) had observed, in man, that it\r\nwas easy to produce movements of the eyes by the passage of the\r\n constant current through the occipital region.[10] Taking this\r\nfact for a starting-point, he used a very low current, and thereby\r\nsucceeded in producing certain definite muscular movements by\r\nstimulation of the cortex in animals. Of Hitzig's work, Sir Victor\r\nHorsley says:--\r\n\r\n   \"It was not till 1870 that the next absolute proof (after Bell's\r\n   work in 1813) was obtained of the localisation of function, so\r\n   far as the highest centres of the nervous system were concerned.\r\n   In that year Fritsch and Hitzig discovered that electrical\r\n   excitation, with minimal stimuli, of various points of the\r\n   cortex, caused those storehouses, of which Willis spoke, to\r\n   discharge, and to reveal their function by the precise\r\n   limitation of the groups of muscles which they were able to\r\n   throw into action. These researches were abundantly confirmed\r\n   and greatly extended by Professor Ferrier, and thus has been\r\n   constructed in the history of this subject the most recent great\r\n   platform or stage of permanent advance.\"[11]\r\n\r\n  [10] That the surface of the brain is not sensitive of such\r\n  stimulation, that it does not perceive its own substance, was\r\n  known to Aristotle. The fact is so familiar that there is no need\r\n  to quote evidence of it, beyond that of Sir Charles Bell: \"I have\r\n  had my finger deep in the anterior lobes of the brain, when the\r\n  patient, being at the time acutely sensible, and capable of\r\n  expressing himself, complained only of the integument.\"\r\n\r\n  [11] Horsley, _Fullerian Lectures_, 1891, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nThe thirty years since Hitzig's work cannot be put here, for they\r\nwould take a volume to themselves. There have been differences of\r\ninterpretation of this or that fact, diversities of results, and\r\nproblems too hard to solve, and other difficulties, such as befall all\r\nthe natural sciences; but these imperfections amount to very little,\r\nwhen the whole result comes to be reckoned. The marvel is that the\r\nwork is so nearly perfect, seeing its immeasurable complexity.\r\n\r\nLet any man, who has but touched the study of physiology, consider\r\nwhat is involved in even the most superficial observation of the\r\nsimplest facts of the nervous system: for instance, the ordinary\r\nnerve-muscle preparation that is taught to every medical student, or\r\nthe microscopic structure of the spinal cord, or the Wallerian method.\r\nOr let him consider how the physiology of the nervous system has been\r\nfounded on the lower forms of life: the work of Romanes and others on\r\nthe Medusa and the Echinodermata, and Huxley's work in biology, and\r\nthe endless chain of forces that are alike in man and in jelly-fishes.\r\nThen let him try to estimate the output of hard thinking, for the\r\nadvance from lower to higher structures, and up to man; the vigilant\r\ncriticism of all theories and foregone conclusions, the incessant\r\nself-judgment and wearisome doubts and disputes all the way,\r\nelusiveness of facts, and vagueness of words. And the results thus\r\nwrung out of science had still to be stated in terms of practice, and\r\ntested by the facts of medicine, surgery, and pathology, and used in\r\nevery hospital in the civilised world, not only for the saving of\r\nlife, but also for the diagnosis and medical or surgical treatment of\r\ninnumerable varieties of disease or injury of the brain, the cord, or\r\nthe nerves. Sir Michael Foster, in a short summary of the problems of\r\nphysiology, puts clearly these consummate difficulties of the\r\nphysiology of the nervous system:--\r\n\r\n   \"In the first place there are what may be called general\r\n   problems, such as, How the food, after its preparation and\r\n   elaboration into blood, is built up into the living substance of\r\n   the several tissues? How the living substance breaks down into\r\n   the dead waste? How the building up and breaking down differ in\r\n   the different tissues in such a way that energy is set free in\r\n   different modes, the muscular tissue contracting, the nervous\r\n   tissue thrilling with a nervous impulse, the secreting tissue\r\n   doing chemical work, and the like? To these general questions\r\n   the answers which we can at present give can hardly be called\r\n   answers at all.\r\n\r\n   \"In the second place there are what may be called special\r\n   problems, such as, What are the various steps by which the blood\r\n   is kept replenished with food and oxygen, and kept free from an\r\n   accumulation of water; and how is the activity of the digestive,\r\n   respiratory, and excretory organs, which effect this, regulated\r\n   and adapted to the stress of circumstances? What are the details\r\n   of the vascular mechanism by which each and every tissue is for\r\n   ever bathed with fresh blood, and how is that working delicately\r\n   adapted to all the varied changes of the body? And, _compared\r\n   with which all other problems are insignificant and preparatory\r\n   only_, how do nervous impulses so flit to and fro within the\r\n   nervous system as to issue in the movements which make up what\r\n   we sometimes call the life of man?\"\r\n\r\nThe physiology of the nervous system is wrought to finer issues now\r\nthan in the time of Bell and Magendie; and this generation of students\r\nmay live to see the present facts and methods of cerebral localisation\r\nas the mere rudiments or elements of science. Happily for mankind,\r\nscience has already so far elucidated them that they have done good\r\nservice for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, and for the saving\r\nof lives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome examples have been given, in the foregoing chapters, of the value\r\nof physiological experiments on animals. It would be easy to lengthen\r\nthe list, for there is no general subject in all physiology that does\r\nnot owe something to this method: as Mr. Darwin said, in his evidence\r\nbefore the Royal Commission of 1875, \"I am fully convinced that\r\nphysiology can progress only by the aid of experiments on living\r\nanimals. I cannot think of any one step which has been made in\r\nphysiology without that aid.\" Many examples have been left out\r\naltogether--the work of Boyle, Hunter, Lavoisier, Haldane, Despretz,\r\nand Regnault, on animal heat and on respiration; of Petit, Dupuy,\r\nBreschet, and Reid, on the sympathetic system; of Galvani, Volta,\r\nHaller, du Bois-Reymond, and Pflüger, on muscular contractility:\r\nnothing has been said of the work lately done on the suprarenal glands\r\nand \"adrenalin,\" and on the blood-pressure in its relation to\r\nsecretion. For the most part, only those examples have been taken that\r\noccur far back in the history of physiology: more has been said about\r\nthe past than about the present. First, because it was necessary to\r\nput an end to the false statements that are made, by those who are\r\nopposed to all experiments on animals, about the work done in the\r\npast. Next, because the abstruse details of physiology, in the\r\npresent, are not intelligible for general reading. Next, because it is\r\nimpossible now to isolate physiology, or to say what belongs to\r\nphysiology alone, to have back the simpler problems of the past, to\r\ndiscover the circulation of the blood twice. But the experimental\r\nmethod, alike in the past and in the present, has been the chief way\r\nof advance. And if a forecast may be made without offence, it is\r\ncertain that the work of physiology, as in the past and the present,\r\nso in the near future, will exercise a profound influence for good on\r\nmedical and surgical treatment. Among the subjects that especially\r\noccupy physiologists now are, the more exact localisation and\r\ninterpretation of the special sense-centres, and the better knowledge\r\nof the internal secretions and chemical influences of the glands and\r\ntissues of the body. It would be hard to find two fields of work more\r\nsure to favour the growth of the _arbor vitæ_ side by side with the\r\n_arbor scientiæ_.\r\n\r\nBut the last word here must be said by a physiologist of the very\r\nhighest authority, Professor Starling. He has kindly given me, for\r\nthis edition, the following note:--\r\n\r\n   \"Among the researches of the last thirty years, those bearing on\r\n   the _Circulation of the Blood_ must take an important place,\r\n   both for their physiological interest and for the weighty\r\n   influence they have exerted on our knowledge and treatment of\r\n   disorders of the vascular system, such as heart disease. We have\r\n   learned to measure accurately the work done by the great\r\n   heart-pump; and by studying the manner in which this work is\r\n   affected by different conditions, we are enabled to increase or\r\n   diminish it, according to the needs of the organ. Experiments in\r\n   what is often regarded as the most transcendental department of\r\n   physiology--_i.e._ that which treats of muscle and nerve--have\r\n   thrown light on the wonderful process of 'compensation,' by\r\n   which a diseased heart is able to keep up a normal circulation.\r\n\r\n   \"_Vaso-motor System._--Largely by the labours of British\r\n   physiologists, the exquisite control exercised by the nervous\r\n   system over every blood-vessel in the body has been brought to\r\n   light, the paths tracked out, and the mechanisms elucidated, by\r\n   means of which the circulation through each part of the body is\r\n   subordinated to the needs of the whole. Since the chief\r\n   vaso-motor nerves take their course through the sympathetic\r\n   system, the researches on their distribution have led to the\r\n   mapping out of the whole of this system, and to an accurate\r\n   knowledge of its functions. We are now acquainted with the\r\n   course, to all parts of the body, of the nerves which not only\r\n   determine the changes in the calibre of the blood-vessels, but\r\n   affect also the secretion of sweat and the erection of the\r\n   hairs. Incidentally, the mapping out of these nerves, in the\r\n   hands of Mackenzie, Head, and others, has led to more power of\r\n   localising the seat of visceral disease.\r\n\r\n   \"_Digestion._--Our knowledge of the processes of digestion has\r\n   of late years received a great accession by the work of\r\n   Professor Pawlow, of St. Petersburg. His success is largely due\r\n   to his recognition of the importance of keeping his experimental\r\n   animals under the most normal conditions possible, and of\r\n   studying the different parts of the alimentary tract in animals\r\n   which were not anæsthetised, but which were free from any pain\r\n   or even discomfort, either of which conditions materially\r\n   interferes with the activity of the digestive glands. He\r\n   therefore established in dogs fistulæ in chosen portions of the\r\n   alimentary canal, analogous to the fistula which accident\r\n   rendered so valuable in the case of Alexis St. Martin. Not only\r\n   has the knowledge thus gained enabled the physician to\r\n   understand the sequel of events in disordered digestion, but the\r\n   success of the operative measures undertaken by physiologists\r\n   for the elucidation of their science has emboldened surgeons to\r\n   attack disease in the most various parts of the alimentary\r\n   canal.\r\n\r\n   \"Renewed study of the secretion of pancreatic juice evoked by\r\n   the passage of the acid digestive products from the stomach into\r\n   the small intestine, which had been described by Pawlow, has\r\n   resulted in the discovery of a new class of chemical agents,\r\n   which act as special messengers from one part of the body to\r\n   another, and exercise an important function in determining the\r\n   action of all parts to one common end.\r\n\r\n   \"_Respiration._--The investigation of the chemical properties of\r\n   the colouring matter of blood, and of its compound with carbon\r\n   monoxide, has resulted, in the hands of Dr. Haldane, in the\r\n   laying down of measures for the prevention of accidents from\r\n   choke-damp or after-damp in mines. The same investigation has\r\n   resulted in the discovery of a method of determining the total\r\n   amount of blood circulating in the body of a living man. The\r\n   application of this method has already added largely to our\r\n   knowledge of the pathology of different forms of anæmia, as well\r\n   as of the conditions obtaining in heart disease. Experiments by\r\n   Hill and others on the physiological effects of compressed air\r\n   have shown the precautions which should be observed in all\r\n   diving operations. A proper appreciation of these results by\r\n   diving-engineers would not only entirely obviate the cases of\r\n   'caisson disease,' but would enable diving to be carried on\r\n   safely to a greater depth than has hitherto been attempted.\r\n\r\n   \"It is impossible, however, to enumerate all the physiological\r\n   gains of the last twenty or thirty years, or to point out their\r\n   manifold applications in the cure and prevention of disease. The\r\n   full control of the processes of disease, which is the goal of\r\n   the physician and the surgeon, can only be attained through an\r\n   accurate knowledge of the conditions governing the functions of\r\n   the healthy body. The foundation of medicine and surgery is\r\n   physiology: and it is only on living animals that the processes\r\n   of life can be investigated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN PATHOLOGY,\r\nMATERIA MEDICA, AND\r\nTHERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION, SUPPURATION, AND BLOOD-POISONING\r\n\r\nPathology, the study of the causes and products of diseases, is a\r\nyounger science than physiology: the use of the microscope was the\r\nbeginning of pathology; and the microscope, even so late as sixty\r\nyears ago, was very different to the microscope now. The great\r\npathologists of that time had not the lenses, microtomes, and reagents\r\nthat are now in daily employment; they knew nothing of the present\r\nmethods of section-cutting and differential staining. But the\r\npublication in 1839 of Schwann's cell-theory marks the rise of modern\r\npathology. In 1843, Darwin wrote his first draft of the doctrine of\r\nthe origin of species; and Pasteur, that year, was in for his\r\nexamination at the École Normale. The work of Schwann, Virchow, and\r\nPasteur had such profound influences on science that the span of sixty\r\nyears seems to cover the modern development of pathology: and this\r\nspan of years is marked, half-way, by the rise of bacteriology. In\r\n1875, when the Royal Commission on Experiments on Animals was held in\r\nLondon, the evidence was concerned practically with physiology alone:\r\nvery little was said about pathology, and of bacteriology hardly a\r\nword. The witnesses say that they \"believe they are beginning to get\r\nan idea\" of the true nature of tubercle: and the evidence as to the\r\nnature of anthrax, given by Sir John Simon, reads now like a very old\r\nprophecy:--\r\n\r\n   \"We are going through a progressive work that has many stages,\r\n   and are now getting more precise knowledge of the contagium. By\r\n   these experiments on sheep it has been made quite clear that the\r\n   contagium of sheep-pox is _something of which the habits can be\r\n   studied: as the habits of a fern or a moss can be studied: and\r\n   we look forward to opportunities of thus studying the contagium\r\n   outside the body which it infects. This is not a thing to be\r\n   done in a day, or perhaps in ten years, but must extend over a\r\n   long period of time._ Dr. Klein's present paper represents one\r\n   very important stage of a vast special study. He gives the\r\n   identification of the contagium as _something which he has\r\n   studied to the end in the infected body, and which can now in a\r\n   future stage be studied outside the body_.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, there was no bacteriology, in the present sense of\r\nthe word: and now the \"habits\" of these \"contagia\" have been studied,\r\noutside and inside the body, with amazing accuracy. It has been\r\nproved, past all possibility of doubt, that the pathogenic bacteria\r\nare the cause of infective diseases; they have fulfilled Koch's\r\npostulates--that they should be found in the diseased tissues, be\r\ncultivated outside the body, reproduce the same disease in animals,\r\nand be found again in the tissues of those animals. By an immeasurable\r\namount of hard work crowded into a few years, this New World of\r\nbacteriology has been subdued. The Royal Commissioners of 1875,\r\nspeaking of physiological experiments only, said, \"It would require a\r\nvoluminous treatise to exhibit in a consecutive statement the benefits\r\nthat medicine and surgery have derived from these discoveries.\" If\r\nphysiology in 1875 required a treatise, bacteriology in 1906 requires\r\na library: and it is impossible here to give more than the faintest\r\noutline of some of the work that has been done.\r\n\r\nBut all pathology is not bacteriology; and it would take a treatise of\r\nprodigious length to set forth the work of modern pathology in the\r\nyears before anything was known of bacteria. The microscopic structure\r\nof tumours and of all forms of malignant disease, the nature of\r\namyloid, fatty, and other degenerative changes, and the chief facts of\r\ngeneral pathology--hypertrophy and atrophy, necrosis, gangrene,\r\nembolism, and many more--all these subjects were studied to good\r\npurpose, before bacteriology. Above all, men were occupied in the\r\nstudy of inflammation under the microscope. It was this use of the\r\nmicroscope that revolutionised pathology; especially, it made visible\r\nthe whole process of inflammation, the most minute changes in the\r\naffected tissues, the slowing and arrest of the blood in the\r\ncapillaries, the choking-up of the stream, and the escape of\r\nblood-cells out of the capillaries into the tissues. Everything had\r\nbeen made ready for the fuller interpretation that was coming from\r\nbacteriology: the old naked-eye descriptions of inflammation were left\r\nbehind; men set aside the definition of Celsus, that it was _rubor et\r\ntumor cum colore et dolore_--words that sound like Molière's jest\r\nabout the _vis dormitiva_ of opium--they watched inflammation under\r\nthe microscope, in such transparent structures as the frog's web and\r\nmesentery, the bat's wing, and the tadpole's tail. It was thus that\r\nWharton Jones discovered the rhythmical contraction of the veins in\r\nthe bat's wing. The discovery of the escape of the white blood-cells,\r\n_diapedesis_, through the walls of the capillaries, was made by Waller\r\nand Cohnheim. To those who are opposed to all experiments on animals,\r\nit may seem a very small thing that a blood-cell should be on one side\r\nor the other of a microscopic film in a tadpole's tail; but this\r\n_diapedesis_, the first move of the blood in its fight against\r\ndisease, is now seen, in the light of Metschnikoff's work, as a fact\r\nof very great importance.\r\n\r\nThe history of this transitional period, from the study of\r\ninflammation in transparent living tissues to the use, in surgery, of\r\nthe facts of bacteriology, is told in Lord Lister's Huxley Lecture,\r\nOctober 1900. He describes how the foundations were laid in surgical\r\npathology, by microscopical and experimental work on inflammation,\r\ncoagulation, suppuration, and pyæmia, for bacteriology to build on:\r\nhow his own share of the work began when he was house-surgeon to Sir\r\nJohn Erichsen at University College Hospital, and afterward to Mr.\r\nSyme in Edinburgh, and how it was continued through all his Edinburgh\r\nand Glasgow life:--\r\n\r\n   \"After being appointed to the Chair of Surgery in the University\r\n   of Glasgow, I became one of the surgeons to the Royal Infirmary\r\n   of that city. Here I had, too, ample opportunities for studying\r\n   hospital diseases, of which the most fearful was pyæmia. About\r\n   this time I saw the opinion expressed by a high authority in\r\n   pathology that the pus in a pyæmic vein was probably a\r\n   collection of leucocytes. Facts such as those which I mentioned\r\n   as having aroused my interest in my student days in a case of\r\n   pyæmia, made such a view to me incredible; and I determined to\r\n   ascertain, if possible, the real state of things by\r\n   experiment....\r\n\r\n   \"While these investigations into the nature of pyæmia were\r\n   proceeding, I was doing my utmost against that deadly scourge.\r\n   Professor Polli, of Milan, having recommended the internal\r\n   administration of sulphite of potash on account of its\r\n   antiputrescent properties, I gave that drug a very full trial as\r\n   a prophylactic.... At the same time, I did my best, by local\r\n   measures, to diminish the risk of communicating contagion from\r\n   one wound to another. I freely employed antiseptic washes, and I\r\n   had on the tables of my wards piles of clean towels to be used\r\n   for drying my hands and those of my assistants after washing\r\n   them, as I insisted should invariably be done in passing from\r\n   one dressing to another. But all my efforts proved abortive; as\r\n   I could hardly wonder when I believed, with chemists generally,\r\n   that putrefaction was caused by the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\n   \"It will thus be seen that I was prepared to welcome Pasteur's\r\n   demonstration that putrefaction, like other true fermentations,\r\n   is caused by microbes growing in the putrescible substance. Thus\r\n   was presented a new problem: not to exclude oxygen from the\r\n   wounds, which was impossible, but to protect them from the\r\n   living causes of decomposition by means which should act with as\r\n   little disturbance of the tissues as is consistent with the\r\n   attainment of the essential object.... To apply that principle,\r\n   so as to ensure the greatest safety with the least attendant\r\n   disadvantage, has been my chief life-work.\"[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] See also the admirable Life of Pasteur, by M. Valléry-Radot.\r\n  Translation by Mrs. Devonshire, vol. ii. p. 20.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the application of that principle is not limited to\r\nthe performance of the major operations of surgery. It is in daily use\r\nin every hospital, and in every practice all the world over, for the\r\nsafe and quick healing of whole legions of injuries, \"casualties,\" and\r\nminor operations.\r\n\r\nBut what of Semmelweis, and his study of puerperal fever? Did he not,\r\nbefore Lord Lister, and without the help of experiments on animals,\r\ndiscover antiseptic surgery? His claim is urged by those who are\r\nopposed to all such experiments. And the answer is, that his work was\r\nlost just for want of experiments on animals. If he could have\r\ndemonstrated, as Pasteur did, the living organism, the thing itself,\r\nthere in the tissues of an infected rabbit, and in a test-tube, and\r\nunder a microscope, he might have stopped the mouths of his\r\nadversaries. He could not. He could only demonstrate to them the fact\r\nthat their patients died, and his patients lived: and that some sort\r\nof direct infection was the cause of the deaths. The tragedy of his\r\nlife cannot be told too often, and may be told again here.[13] For\r\nwant of the final proof that bacteriology, and the inoculation of\r\nanimals, alone could give, he was unable to hold out against his\r\nenemies till Pasteur could rescue him.\r\n\r\n  [13] This account of Semmelweis, reprinted by permission from the\r\n  _Middlesex Hospital Journal_, is mostly taken from Dr. Theodore\r\n  Duka's excellent paper on \"Childbed Fever.\" (_Lancet_, 1886.)\r\n\r\nIn 1846, when he was twenty-three years old, Ignaz Semmelweis was\r\nappointed assistant-professor in the maternity department of the huge\r\ngeneral hospital of Vienna. For many years, the mortality in the\r\nlying-in wards had been about 1.25 per cent., and no more. Then, under\r\na new professor, it had risen; and, for some years before Semmelweis\r\ncame on the scene, it had been 5 per cent., or even 7 per cent. In\r\nOctober 1841, there had been an epidemic that had lasted till May\r\n1843. In these twenty months, out of 5139 women delivered, 829 had\r\ndied; that is to say, 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere were two sets of wards in the maternity department. The one set\r\nmay be called Clinique A, and the other Clinique B. For many years,\r\nthe mortality had been the same in each. In 1841 a change was made:\r\nClinique A was assigned to the teaching of students, and Clinique B to\r\nthe teaching of midwives: and, so soon as this change had been made,\r\nthe mortality in Clinique B became less, but the mortality in Clinique\r\nA did not. Commissions of inquiry were held, and in vain. It was\r\nsuggested that the foreign students were somehow to blame, nobody knew\r\nwhy; and many of them were sent away. Still the deaths went on. Women\r\nadmitted to Clinique A would go down on their knees and pray to be\r\nallowed to go home; almost every day the bell was heard ringing in the\r\nwards, for the administration of the Sacrament to a dying woman.\r\nPeople talked about atmospheric influences, and overcrowding, and the\r\ntainted air of old wards, and the power of the mind over the body: and\r\nSemmelweis set to work.\r\n\r\nHe observed that cases of protracted labour in Clinique A died, almost\r\nall of them; but not in Clinique B. He observed also that cases of\r\npremature labour, nearly all of them, did well, whichever Clinique\r\nthey were in; so did those women who were delivered before they came\r\nto the hospital, and were admitted after delivery. He observed also\r\nthat a row of patients, lying side by side, would all be attacked at\r\nonce in Clinique A; which never happened in Clinique B. He tried\r\neverything: he altered the details of treatment; he used various\r\nsubterfuges to prevent one of the professors from examining serious\r\ncases; he enforced this or that rule in Clinique A, because it was the\r\ncustom in Clinique B; he slaved away at the notes of the cases--and at\r\nlast the truth came to him, by the death of one of his friends from a\r\ndissection-wound. He says, \"My friend's fatal symptoms unveiled to my\r\nmind an identity with those which I had so often noticed at the\r\ndeathbeds of puerperal cases.\" He saw now that the students, coming\r\nstraight from the dissecting-rooms, had infected the patients during\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIn May 1847 he gave orders that every student, before examining,\r\nshould thoroughly disinfect his hands. But, though he had reckoned\r\nwith dissecting-room poisons, he had forgotten to reckon with other\r\nsources of infection. In October of that year, a woman was admitted\r\nwho had malignant disease; of twelve women examined after her, eleven\r\ngot puerperal fever, and died. In November, a woman was admitted who\r\nhad a suppurating knee-joint, with sinuses; and eight women were\r\ninfected from her, and died. Therefore Semmelweis said, \"Not only can\r\nthe particles from dead bodies generate puerperal fever, but any\r\ndecomposed material from the living body can also generate it, and so\r\ncan air contaminated by such materials.\" Henceforth he isolated all\r\ninfected cases, he enforced the strict use of disinfectants: and the\r\nmortality in Clinique A, which in May 1847 had stood at 12.24 per\r\ncent., fell in December to 3.04, and in 1848 was 1.27.\r\n\r\nHis work was taken up with enthusiasm by Hebra, Skoda, and Haller; the\r\nnews of it was sent to every capital in Europe. In February 1849\r\nHaller read a paper on it before the Medical Society of Vienna, and\r\nsaid, \"The importance of these observations is above all calculation,\r\n_both for the maternity department and for the hospitals in general,\r\nbut particularly for the surgical wards_.\" A committee was nominated\r\nto report on the whole matter; but it was opposed by the professor in\r\ncharge of Clinique A, and nothing came of it. In May 1850, Semmelweis\r\nopened a great debate on puerperal fever, which occupied three\r\nsittings of the Vienna Medical Society. His opponents were there in\r\nfull force, all the Scribes and Pharisees of the profession. They\r\nbrought about a vague distrust of his figures and his facts; they got\r\npeople to believe that there must be \"something else\" in puerperal\r\nfever, as well as the local infection. Semmelweis began to be\r\ndiscouraged. The University authorities made a dead set against\r\nhim--they refused to renew his appointment, they got him out of the\r\nhospital, and out of Vienna. He went to Pesth, and was Professor of\r\nMidwifery there; but the same opposition and hostility were at Pesth\r\nas at Vienna. Slowly he began to lose his hold over himself, went down\r\nhill, became excitable and odd. The end came in July 1865. At a\r\nmeeting of University professors, he suddenly took a paper from his\r\npocket and read aloud to them a solemn oath, to be enforced on every\r\nmidwife and every doctor. His mind had given way: he was moved to an\r\nasylum at Vienna, and died there a few weeks later. He was only\r\nforty-two when he died--_What a wounded name, Things standing thus\r\nunknown, shall live behind me._\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the work of Semmelweis and the work of Pasteur\r\ncuts like a knife here. The failure of Semmelweis' teaching may be\r\nestimated by the fact that it had all to be done over again. The year\r\nof his success at Vienna was 1848. Eight years later, in the Paris\r\nMaternity Hospital, between 1st April and 10th May 1856, came such an\r\noutbreak of puerperal fever that out of 347 patients 64 died. In 1864,\r\nout of 1350 cases, 310 deaths. In Jan.-Feb. 1866, out of 103 cases, 28\r\ndeaths: \"Women of the lower classes looked upon the Maternité as the\r\nvestibule of death.\" In 1877-78, came the use of carbolic acid and\r\nperchloride of mercury at the hospital, thirty years after Semmelweis'\r\nwork: and, about the same time, Pasteur's discovery of the\r\nstreptococcus in puerperal fever.[14] Pasteur could demonstrate to\r\nhis opponents the visible cause of the infection, the thing itself.\r\nRoux tells the story:--\r\n\r\n   \"Dans le pus des abcès chauds et dans celui des furoncles on\r\n   constate un petit organisme arrondi, disposé en amas, qu'on\r\n   cultive facilement dans le bouillon. On le retrouve dans\r\n   l'ostéomyélite infectieuse des enfants. Pasteur affirme que\r\n   l'ostéomyélite et le furoncle sont deux formes d'une même\r\n   maladie, et que l'ostéomyélite est le furoncle de l'os. En 1878,\r\n   cette assertion a fait rire bien les chirurgiens.\r\n\r\n   \"Dans les infections puerpérales, les caillots renferment un\r\n   microbe à grains arrondis se disposant en files. Cet aspect en\r\n   chapelet est surtout manifesté dans les cultures. Pasteur\r\n   n'hésite pas à déclarer que cet organisme microscopique est la\r\n   cause la plus fréquente des infections chez les femmes\r\n   accouchées. Un jour, dans une discussion sur la fièvre\r\n   puerpérale à l'Académie de Médicine, un de ses collégues le plus\r\n   écoutés dissertait éloquemment sur les causes des épidémies dans\r\n   les maternités. Pasteur l'interrompt de sa place: _Ce qui cause\r\n   l'épidémie, ce n'est rien de tout cela: c'est le médecin et son\r\n   personnel qui transportent le microbe d'une femme malade à une\r\n   femme saine._ Et comme l'orateur répondit qu'il craignait fort\r\n   qu'on ne trouve jamais ce microbe, Pasteur s'élance vers le\r\n   tableau noir, dessine l'organisme en chapelet de grains, en\r\n   disant, _Tenez, voici sa figure_.\" (Roux, _L'OEuvre Médicale de\r\n   Pasteur_. _Agenda du Chimiste_, 1896, p. 528.)\r\n\r\n  [14] See Pasteur's Life, vol. ii. p. 89.\r\n\r\nAll suppuration, and all forms of \"blood-poisoning\"--abscesses, boils,\r\ncarbuncles, erysipelas, puerperal fever, septicæmia, pyæmia--are due\r\nto minute organisms, various kinds of _micrococcus_. It has indeed\r\nbeen shown that suppuration may, in exceptional conditions, occur\r\nwithout micro-organisms: but practically every case of suppuration is\r\na case of infection either from without or from within the body.\r\nThere is no room here for any account of the work spent on these\r\nmicrococci: on their identification, isolation, culture, and\r\ninoculation. It is the same with all the pathogenic bacteria--each\r\nkind has its own habits, phases and idiosyncrasies, antagonisms and\r\npreferences: nothing is left unstudied--the influences of air, light,\r\nheat, and chemistry; all the facts of their growth, division, range of\r\nvariation, grades of virulence, vitality, and products; the entire\r\nlife and death of each species, and everything that it is, and does,\r\nand can be made to do. The difficulties of bacteriology are written\r\nacross every page of the text-books: above all, the difficulties of\r\nattenuating or intensifying the virulence of bacteria, and of\r\nimmunising animals, and of procuring from them an immunising serum of\r\nexact and constant strength. Every antitoxin is the outcome of an\r\nimmeasurable expenditure of hard international work, unsurpassed in\r\nall science for the fineness of its methods and the closeness of its\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nThe older theories of disease had attributed infection to the\r\nintemperature of the weather, the powers of the air, or the work of\r\nthe devil; later, men recognised that there must be a _materies\r\nmorbi_, something particulate, transmissible, and perhaps alive, but\r\nit was still a \"nameless something.\" Therefore, they over-estimated\r\nthe constitutional, personal aspect of a case of infective disease,\r\nagainst the plain evidence of case-to-case infection or inoculation:\r\nthey studied with infinite care and minuteness the weather, the\r\nenvironment, the family history, the previous illnesses of the\r\npatient--everything, except the immediate cause of the trouble. But\r\nmodern pathology, like Pasteur, says, _Tenez, voici sa figure_.\r\n\r\nThe antiseptic method was based on bacteriology, resting as it did on\r\nthe proof afforded by Pasteur that putrefaction was caused by\r\nbacteria, and not by the oxygen of the air, as had been previously\r\nbelieved. If any man would measure one very small part of the lives\r\nthat are saved by this method, let him contrast the treatment of\r\nempyema fifty years ago with its treatment now. If he would measure\r\nthe saving, not of lives but of limbs, let him take the treatment of\r\ncompound fractures. If he would measure the saving of patients from\r\npain, fever, and long confinement to bed, let him take the ordinary\r\nrun of surgical cases, not only the major operations but all\r\nabscesses, lacerated wounds, foul sores, and so forth.\r\n\r\nA serum has also been used of late years for the treatment of\r\nmicrococcus-infection, and has given good results in many cases. It\r\nhas been used, also, to avert the risk of such infection in certain\r\noperations where the antiseptic method cannot be strictly carried out.\r\nFor the use of a \"polyvalent\" serum, reference may be made to the\r\nrecent paper by Dr. W. S. Fenwick and Dr. Parkinson. (_Trans. Roy.\r\nMed. Chir. Soc._, 1906.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nANTHRAX\r\n\r\nIn animals, anthrax is also called _charbon_, splenic fever, or\r\nsplenic apoplexy: in man, the name of _malignant pustule_ is given to\r\nthe sore at the point of accidental inoculation, and the name of\r\n_woolsorter's disease_ is given to those cases of anthrax where the\r\nlungs are infected by inhalation of the spores of the _bacillus\r\nanthracis_. The disease occurs among hide-dressers, woolsorters,\r\nbrushmakers, and rag-pickers: among animals, it occurs in sheep,\r\ncattle, horses, and swine:--\r\n\r\n   \"Many of the outbreaks of anthrax in England have been in the\r\n   neighbourhood of Bradford, and have been traced to the use of\r\n   infected wool-refuse as manure. A map published by the Board of\r\n   Agriculture shows that the outbreaks of anthrax are most\r\n   frequent in those counties of Great Britain where dry foreign\r\n   wools, hairs, hides, and skins are manufactured into goods. In\r\n   1892, there were forty-two outbreaks of anthrax in the West\r\n   Riding of Yorkshire, as against two in the North Riding, and one\r\n   in the East Riding. An undoubted fact in connection with anthrax\r\n   is its tendency to recur on certain farms. During 1895, the\r\n   disease reappeared on twenty-three farms or other premises in\r\n   England, and six in Scotland, where it had been reported in the\r\n   previous year.\" (Dr. Poore's Milroy Lectures, _On the Earth in\r\n   relation to Contagia_, 1899.)\r\n\r\nAn admirable account of the disease, as it occurs in man, is given by\r\nDr. Hamer and Dr. Bell, in the valuable series of monographs edited by\r\nDr. Oliver of Newcastle, under the title _Dangerous Trades_ (London,\r\nJohn Murray, 1902). Happily, the disease is very rare among men, even\r\namong those most exposed to it. For its treatment in man, an antitoxin\r\nhas been used with some success: but the cases are too few to be of\r\nmuch importance.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] Dr. Legge, in his Milroy Lectures, 1905, on Industrial\r\n  Anthrax (_Lancet_, March and April 1905), gives a full account of\r\n  Sobernheim's work up to March 1904, and a table of seventy-six\r\n  cases, treated with Sclavo's serum.\r\n\r\nThe _bacillus anthracis_ was first seen more than fifty years ago:\r\n\"Anthrax has the distinction of being the first infectious disease the\r\nbacterial nature of which was definitely proven.\"[16] Pollender in\r\n1844, Roger and Davaine in 1850, noted the _petits bâtonnets_ in the\r\nblood of sheep dead of the disease, and thought they were some sort of\r\nmicroscopic blood-crystals: it was not till 1863, after Pasteur's\r\nstudy of lactic-acid fermentation, that Davaine realised they were\r\nliving organisms. Afterward, Koch succeeded in making cultures of\r\nthem, and reproduced the disease by inoculating animals with these\r\ncultures; yet it was said, so late as 1876, that the _bacillus\r\nanthracis_ was not the cause of anthrax, but only the sign of it:\r\n\"Along with the bacilli, there are blood-cells and blood-plasma, and\r\nthese contain the true amorphous virus of anthrax.\" Then came\r\nPasteur's work, and reached its end in the experiments at Chartres,\r\nand the famous test-inoculations (1881) at Pouilly-le-Fort.\r\n\r\n  [16] See Dr. Flexner's account of the disease, in volume xix. of\r\n  Stedman's _Twentieth Century Practice_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Agenda du Chimiste_ (1896) M. Roux gives the following account\r\nof this work, which he watched from first to last:--\r\n\r\n   \"Vaccination against _charbon_ has now been put to the test of\r\n   practice for fourteen years. Wherever it is adopted, there the\r\n   losses from _charbon_ have become insignificant. It was followed\r\n   by vaccination against swine-measles, _rouget des porcs_, the\r\n   special study of our poor friend Thuillier. But the immediate\r\n   result of Pasteur's vaccinations is their least merit: they have\r\n   given men absolute faith in a science that could show such good\r\n   works, they have started a movement that is irresistible; above\r\n   all, they have set going the whole study of immunity, which is\r\n   bringing us at last to a right way of treating infective\r\n   diseases.\r\n\r\n   \"Virulence is a quality that microbes can lose, or can acquire.\r\n   Suppose we came across the anthrax-bacillus so far attenuated,\r\n   in the way of Nature, that it had lost all power to kill--of\r\n   course we should fail to recognise it; we should take it for an\r\n   ordinary bacillus of putrefaction: you must watch it through\r\n   each phase of its attenuation, to know that the harmless\r\n   organism is the descendant of the fatal virus. But you can give\r\n   back to it the virulence that it has lost, if you put it, to\r\n   begin with, under the skin of a very delicate subject, a mouse\r\n   only one day old. With the blood of this mouse inoculate\r\n   another, a little older, and it will die. Passing by this method\r\n   from younger to older mice, we come to kill adult mice,\r\n   guinea-pigs, then rabbits, then sheep, etc. Thus, by\r\n   transmission, the virus gains strength as it goes. Doubtless\r\n   this increase of virulence, that we bring about by experiment,\r\n   occurs also in Nature; and it is easy to see how a microbe,\r\n   usually harmless to this or that species of animals, might\r\n   become deadly to it. Is not this the way that infective diseases\r\n   have appeared on the earth from age to age?\r\n\r\n   \"_See how far we have come, from the old metaphysical ideas\r\n   about virulence, to these microbes that we can turn this way or\r\n   that way--stuff so plastic that a man can work on it, and\r\n   fashion it as he likes._\"\r\n\r\nPasteur's note on the attenuation of anthrax was presented to the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences on 28th February 1881; and the test-inoculations\r\nat Pouilly-le-Fort were made in May of that year. It was hardly to be\r\nexpected that every country, in every year, should obtain such results\r\nas France now takes as a matter of course; and at one time, about\r\ntwenty-one years ago, there was in Hungary a \"conscientious objection\"\r\nto the inoculation of herds against the disease. But in Italy, from\r\n1st May 1897 to 30th April 1898, the issue of anti-charbon vaccine\r\nfrom one institute alone, the Sero-Therapeutic Institute at Milan, was\r\n165,000 tubes, enough to inoculate 33,734 cattle and 98,792 sheep. And\r\nin France, between 1882 and 1893, more than three million sheep, and\r\nnearly half a million cattle, were inoculated.\r\n\r\nThe work done in France was published by M. Chamberland, in the\r\n_Annales de L'Institut Pasteur_, March 1894. The following translation\r\nof his memoir--_Résultats pratiques des Vaccinations contre le Charbon\r\net le Rouget en France_--shows something of the national influence of\r\nthe Pasteur Institute:--\r\n\r\n1. _Charbon_\r\n\r\n\"After the famous experiments at Pouilly-le-Fort, MM. Pasteur and Roux\r\nentrusted to me the whole method and practice of the vaccinations\r\nagainst _charbon_. Twelve years have passed, and it is now time to\r\nput together the results, and to make a final estimate of the value\r\nof these preventive inoculations.\r\n\r\n\"Every year we ask the veterinary surgeons to report--\r\n\r\n1. The number of animals they have vaccinated.\r\n\r\n2. The number that have died after the first vaccination.\r\n\r\n3. The number that have died after the second vaccination, within the\r\ntwelve days following it.\r\n\r\n4. The number that have died during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n5.

column with those in the second,\r\nwe see that a certain number of veterinary surgeons neglect to send\r\ntheir reports at the end of the year. The number of reports that come\r\nto us even tends to get less each year. The fact is, that many\r\nveterinary surgeons who do vaccinations every year content themselves\r\nwith writing, 'The results are always very good; it is useless to send\r\nyou reports that are always the same.'\r\n\r\n\"We have every reason to believe, as a matter of fact, that those who\r\nsend no reports are satisfied; for if anything goes wrong with the\r\nherds, they do not fail to let us know it at once by special letters.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, thanks chiefly to new veterinary surgeons who do send\r\nreports, we see that in the twelve years, up to 1st January of this\r\nyear, we have had exact returns as to 1,788,879 sheep and 200,962\r\ncattle--about half of all those that were vaccinated.\r\n\r\n\"The mortality among sheep and cattle is slightly higher after the\r\nfirst vaccination than after the second. This fact seems to us easy to\r\nexplain. The animals reported dead include both those that died as the\r\nresult of the vaccinations, and those that, being already infected at\r\nthe time, died of the actual disease. But, at the time of second\r\nvaccination, the animals are already more or less protected: hence a\r\nlower mortality from the actual disease, and a lower sum total.\r\n\r\n\"The whole loss of sheep is about 1 per cent.: the average for the\r\ntwelve years is 0.94. So we may say that _the whole average loss of\r\nvaccinated sheep, whether from vaccination or from the disease itself\r\nis about 1 per cent_. The loss of vaccinated cattle is still less: for\r\nthe period of twelve years, it is 0.34, or about 1/3 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"These results are extremely satisfactory. It is to be noted\r\nespecially that the average annual death-rate from _charbon_, before\r\nvaccination--the average given in these reports--is estimated at 10\r\nper cent. among sheep, and 5 per cent. among cattle. But even if we\r\nput it at 6 per cent. for sheep, and 3-1/3 per cent. for cattle, and\r\nsay that the worth of a sheep is 30 francs, and of an ox or a cow 150\r\nfrancs--which is well below their real value--even then it is obvious\r\nthat the advantage of these vaccinations to French agriculture is\r\nabout five million francs in sheep, and two million in cattle. And\r\nthese figures are rather too low than too high.\r\n\r\n2. _Rouget_\r\n\r\n\"Some years after the discovery of vaccination against _charbon_, M.\r\nPasteur discovered the vaccine for a disease of swine known under the\r\nname of _rouget_. From 1886, these vaccines were prepared and sent out\r\nunder the same conditions as the vaccines against _charbon_. The\r\nfollowing table gives the reports that have come to us of this\r\ndisease:[17]--\r\n\r\nVACCINATION AGAINST ROUGET (FRANCE).\r\n\r\n    +------+-----------+--------+----------+------------------------+\r\n    |      |           |        |          |       Mortality.       |\r\n    |      |           |        | Animals  +-------+-------+--------+\r\n    |      |   Total   |        |Vaccinated|After  |After  |During  |\r\n    |      | Number of | Number |according |First  |Second |the rest|\r\n    |      |  Animals  |   of   |to Reports|Vacci- |Vacci- |of the  |\r\n    |Years.|Vaccinated.|Reports.|received. |nation,|nation.| Year.  |\r\n    +------+-----------+--------+----------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n    |      |{ For these|        |          |       |       |        |\r\n    |      |{ two years|        |          |       |       |        |\r\n    | 1886 |{ France   |   49   |   7,087  |   91  |   24  |    56  |\r\n    |      |{ and other|        |          |       |       |        |\r\n    |      |{ countries|        |          |       |       |        |\r\n    | 1887 |{ are put  |   49   |   7,467  |   57  |   10  |    23  |\r\n    |      |{ together.|        |          |       |       |        |\r\n    | 1888 |   15,958  |   31   |   6,968  |   31  |   25  |    38  |\r\n    | 1889 |   19,338  |   41   |  11,257  |   92  |   12  |    40  |\r\n    | 1890 |   17,658  |   41   |  14,992  |  118  |   64  |    73  |\r\n    | 1891 |   20,583  |   47   |  17,556  |  102  |   34  |    70  |\r\n    | 1892 |   37,900  |   38   |  10,128  |   43  |   19  |    46  |\r\n    +------+-----------+--------+----------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n    |Total |  111,437  |  296   |  75,455  |  534  |  188  |   345  |\r\n    +------+-----------+--------+----------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n\r\n    +------+-------+-----+-------+\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    |      |       |     |Average|\r\n    |      |       |Total| loss  |\r\n    |      | Total.| loss|before |\r\n    |      |       | per |Vacci- |\r\n    |Years.|       | 100.|nation.|\r\n    +------+-------+-----+-------+\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    | 1886 |  171  | 2.41|  20%  |\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    | 1887 |   90  | 1.21|   \"   |\r\n    |      |       |     |       |\r\n    | 1888 |   94  | 1.35|   \"   |\r\n    | 1889 |  144  | 1.28|   \"   |\r\n    | 1890 |  254  | 1.70|   \"   |\r\n    | 1891 |  206  | 1.17|   \"   |\r\n    | 1892 |  108  | 1.07|   \"   |\r\n    +------+-------+-----+-------+\r\n    |Total | 1,067 | 1.45|  20%  |\r\n    +------+-------+-----+-------+\r\n\r\n  [17] \"The reports for 1893 are at present too few to be utilised\r\n  for this table.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The total average of losses during the past seven years is 1.45 per\r\ncent., or about 1-1/2 per cent._\r\n\r\n\"This average is appreciably higher than the average for _charbon_.\r\nBut it must be noted that the mortality from _rouget_ among swine,\r\nbefore vaccination, was much higher than that from _charbon_ among\r\nsheep. It was about 20 per cent.; a certain number of reports speak of\r\nlosses of 60 and even 80 per cent.: so that almost all the veterinary\r\nsurgeons are loud in their praises of the new vaccination.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of M. Chamberland's paper is concerned with the defects, such\r\nas they are, of the vaccinations, and the need of absolute cleanliness\r\nin the making of them: which is somewhat difficult for this vast\r\nnumber of vaccinations of animals all over France, and in other parts\r\nof the world. The whole story of the discovery is told in M.\r\nValléry-Radot's Life of Pasteur: and the whole story of _rouget_, in\r\nthe same most fascinating book, vol. ii., p. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTUBERCLE\r\n\r\nBefore Laennec, tubercle had been taken for a degenerative change of\r\nthe tissues, much like other forms of degeneration. It was Laennec who\r\nbrought men to see that it is a disease of itself, different from\r\nanything else; and this great discovery of the specific nature of\r\ntubercle, and his invention of the stethoscope, place him almost level\r\nwith Harvey. He founded the facts of tubercle, and on that foundation\r\nVillemin built. In 1865, Villemin communicated to the Académie des\r\nSciences his discovery that tubercle is an infective disease; that he\r\nhad produced it in rabbits, by inoculating them with tuberculous\r\nmatter. _En voici les preuves_, he said. He appealed to these\r\ninoculations to prove his teaching:--\r\n\r\n   _La tuberculose est une affection spécifique. Sa cause réside\r\n   dans un agent inoculable. L'inoculation se fait très-bien de\r\n   l'homme au lapin. La tuberculose appartient donc à la classe des\r\n   maladies virulentes._\r\n\r\nIt was no new thing to say, or to guess, that phthisis was or might be\r\ninfective. So far back as 1500, Frascatorius had said that phthisis\r\ncame \"by the gliding of the corrupt and noisome humours of the patient\r\ninto the lungs of a healthy man.\" Surely, if clinical experience\r\ncould suffice, men would have made something out of this wisdom of\r\nFrascatorius. They made nothing of it; they waited three hundred years\r\nfor Villemin to inoculate the rabbits, and then the thing was\r\ndone--_En voici les preuves_. Three years later, Chauveau produced the\r\ndisease in animals, not by inoculation, but by the admixture of\r\ntuberculous matter with their food. Then, as the work grew, there came\r\na short period of uncertainty: different species of animals are so\r\nwidely different in their susceptibility to the disease that the\r\nresults of further inoculations seemed to go against Villemin; and it\r\nwas not till 1880 that Cohnheim finally established Villemin's\r\nteaching, and even went beyond it, making inoculation the very proof\r\nof tubercle:--\r\n\r\n   \"Everything is tuberculous, that can produce tuberculous disease\r\n   by inoculation in animals that are susceptible to that disease:\r\n   and nothing is tuberculous, that cannot do this.\"\r\n\r\nThen, in 1881, came the welcome news that Koch had discovered the\r\nbacillus of tubercle. In his first published account of it (24th March\r\n1882) he says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Henceforth, in our warfare against this fearful scourge of our\r\n   race, we have to reckon not with a nameless something, but with\r\n   a definite parasite, whose conditions of life are for the most\r\n   part already known, and can be further studied.... Before all\r\n   things, we must shut off the sources of the infection, so far as\r\n   it is in the power of man to do this.\"[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] \"In Zukunft wird man es im Kampf gegen diese schreckliche\r\n  Plage des Menschengeschlechtes nicht mehr mit einem unbestimmten\r\n  Etwas, sondern mit einem fassbaren Parasiten zu thun haben, dessen\r\n  Lebensbedingungen zum grössten Theil bekannt sind und noch weiter\r\n  erforscht werden. Es müssen vor allen Dingen die Quellen, aus\r\n  denen der Infektionsstoff fliesst, so weit es in menschlicher\r\n  Macht liegt, verschlossen werden.\"\r\n\r\nIn November 1890 he announced, in the _Deutsche Medizinische\r\nWochenschrift_, the discovery of tuberculin. Its failure was one of\r\nthe world's tragedies. The defeat may not be final, and we may live to\r\nsee phthisis fought and beaten with its own weapons: but, for the\r\npresent, it is more to the purpose to consider what other benefits\r\nhave been gained, from the discovery of the tubercle-bacillus in 1881,\r\nin every civilised country in the world.\r\n\r\n1. It has given to everybody a more reasonable and hopeful view of\r\nphthisis and the diseases allied to it. The older doctrine of\r\nheredity, that the child inherits the disease itself, has given way to\r\nthe doctrine that the inheritance, in the vast majority of cases, is\r\nnot that of the disease itself, but that of a tendency or increased\r\nsusceptibility to the disease.\r\n\r\n2. It has brought about an immense improvement in the early and\r\naccurate diagnosis of all cases. The bacillus found in the sputa, or\r\nin the discharges, or in a particle of tissue, is evidence that the\r\ncase is tuberculous.\r\n\r\n3. It has given evidence, which till 1901 was hardly called in\r\nquestion,[19] that _tabes mesenterica_, a tuberculous disease which\r\nkills thousands of children every year, is due in many cases to\r\ninfection from the milk of tuberculous cows. In England alone, in\r\n1895, the number of children who died of this disease was 7389, of\r\nwhom 3855 were under one year old.\r\n\r\n  [19] At the British Congress on Tuberculosis, London, 1901, Koch\r\n  stated that bovine tuberculosis and human tuberculosis are not one\r\n  and the same disease, and that the risk of milk-infection is so\r\n  small that burdensome restrictions ought not to be enforced. In\r\n  the general judgment of men well qualified to study the subject,\r\n  he failed to prove his point.\r\n\r\n4. It has proved, and has taught everybody to see the proof, that the\r\nsputa of phthisical patients are the chief cause of the dissemination\r\nof the disease. By insisting on this fact, it has profoundly\r\ninfluenced the nursing and the home-care of phthisical patients; and\r\nit has begun to influence public opinion in favour of some sort of\r\nnotification of the disease, and in favour of enforcing a law against\r\nspitting in public places and conveyances. In some of the principal\r\ncities of the United States, laws on this subject have already been\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\n5. It has greatly helped to bring about the present rigorous control\r\nof the meat and milk trades. The following paragraph, taken almost at\r\nrandom, will suffice here:--\r\n\r\n   \"Bacteriological examinations during the past year have shown\r\n   that more milks are tuberculosis-infected than is generally\r\n   supposed, and the importance of carefully supervising milk\r\n   supplies is becoming more and more acknowledged. Veterinary\r\n   surgeons are practically agreed that tuberculin is a reliable\r\n   and safe test for diagnosing the presence of tuberculosis in\r\n   animals, but affords no index of the extent or degree of the\r\n   disease. The test, however, will not produce tuberculosis in\r\n   healthy animals, and has no deleterious effect upon the general\r\n   health of the animals. The London County Council have decided\r\n   that all cows in London cowsheds shall be inspected by a\r\n   veterinary surgeon regularly once in every three months, and\r\n   that a systematic bacteriological examination shall be conducted\r\n   of milks collected from purveyors.\" (_Medical Annual_, 1901.)\r\n\r\n6. Tuberculin has come into general use for the detection of\r\ntuberculosis in cattle, to \"shut off the sources of the infection.\" A\r\nfull account of this method in different countries was given by\r\nProfessor Bang, of Copenhagen, at the Fourth Congress on\r\nTuberculosis, Paris, 1898. The injection of tuberculin is followed in\r\neight to twelve hours by a well-marked rise of temperature, if the\r\nanimal be tuberculous. Of this test, Professor McFadyean, Principal of\r\nthe Royal Veterinary College, London, says:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have no hesitation in saying that, taking full account of its\r\n   imperfection, tuberculin is the most valuable means of diagnosis\r\n   in tuberculosis that we possess.... I have most implicit faith\r\n   in it, when it is used on animals standing in their own premises\r\n   and undisturbed. It is not reliable when used on animals in a\r\n   market or slaughter-house. A considerable number of errors at\r\n   first were found when I examined animals in slaughter-houses\r\n   after they had been conveyed there by rail, etc. Since that,\r\n   using it on animals in their own premises, I have found that it\r\n   is practically infallible. I have notes of one particular case,\r\n   where twenty-five animals in one dairy were tested, and\r\n   afterwards all were killed. There was only one animal which did\r\n   not react, and it was the only animal not found to be\r\n   tuberculous when killed.\"\r\n\r\nTwo instances of the validity of this test will suffice. In 1899, it\r\nwas applied to 270 cows on some farms in Lancashire. Of these cows,\r\n180 reacted to the test, 85 did not react, and 5 were doubtful.\r\nTuberculous disease was actually found, when they were killed, in 175\r\nout of the 180 = 97.2 per cent. (_Lancet_, 5th August 1899.) In 1901,\r\nArloing and Courmont published a critical account of the whole\r\nsubject, and gave the following facts. In 80 calves, which on\r\nexamination after death were found not tuberculous, the test was\r\nnegative: in 70 older cattle, which were tuberculous, the test was\r\npositive in every case but one, though the dilution of the serum was\r\n1 in 10.[20] It would be easy to add instances of the value of this\r\ntest, for it is practised far and wide over the world.\r\n\r\n  [20] For references to this paper, and to evidence put forward\r\n  against the validity of the test, and for criticism of such\r\n  evidence, see Gould's _Year-Book of Medicine and Surgery_, 1902\r\n  (Philadelphia, W. B. Saunders & Company).\r\n\r\n7. More recently, the discovery of the \"opsonic index,\" and its use by\r\nSir Almroth Wright and others, has given a great advance to the\r\nobservation and treatment of cases of tuberculosis. The administration\r\nof the \"new tuberculin\" is now timed and measured with an accuracy\r\nwhich was absolutely impossible a few years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry, from the present method of counting how many\r\ntubercle-bacilli are taken up by a single blood-cell, back to\r\nVillemin's rabbits. Every inch of the way, from 1881 onward, the\r\npathological study of every form of tuberculosis, medical or surgical,\r\nhuman or bovine, has been dependent on bacteriology; that is to say,\r\non experiments on animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERIA\r\n\r\nThe bacillus of diphtheria, the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, was first\r\ndescribed by Klebs in 1875, and was first obtained in pure culture by\r\nLoeffler in 1884. Its isolation was a matter of great difficulty, and\r\nthe work of many years, because of its association in the mouth with\r\nother species of bacteria. The following table, from Hewlett's _Manual\r\nof Bacteriology_, is a good instance of one of many practical\r\ndifficulties. Out of 353 cases of diphtheria, bacteriological\r\nexamination found the diphtheria-bacillus alone in 216 cases. In the\r\nremaining 137 it was associated with the following organisms:--\r\n\r\n    Streptococci                      6\r\n    Staphylococci                    55\r\n    Bacilli                          19\r\n    Torulæ                            9\r\n    Sarcinæ                           6\r\n    Streptococci and micrococci       2\r\n    Micrococci and bacilli            9\r\n    Streptococci and bacilli          1\r\n    Torulæ and bacilli                1\r\n    Micrococci and sarcinæ            6\r\n    Micrococci and torulæ             4\r\n    Many forms present together      19\r\n                                   ----\r\n                                    137\r\n                                   ----\r\n\r\nIn December 1890 came the news that Behring and Kitasato had at last\r\ncleared the way for the use of an antitoxin:--\r\n\r\n   \"Our researches on diphtheria and on tetanus have led us to the\r\n   question of immunity and cure of these two diseases; and we\r\n   succeeded in curing infected animals, and in immunising healthy\r\n   animals, so that they have become incapable of contracting\r\n   diphtheria or tetanus.\"\r\n\r\nAronsen, Sidney Martin, Escherich, Klemensiewicz, and many more, were\r\nworking on the same lines; and in 1893, Behring and Kossel and Heubner\r\npublished the first cases treated with antitoxin. Then, in 1894, came\r\nthe Congress of Hygiene and Demography at Budapest, and Roux's\r\ntriumphant account of the good results already obtained. Thus the\r\ntreatment is not many years old; but, if the whole world could\r\ntabulate its results, the total number of lives saved would already be\r\nsomewhere above a quarter of a million. Men found it hard at first to\r\nbelieve the full wonder of the discovery: the medical journals of 1895\r\nand 1896 still contain the fossils of criticism--all the _may be_ and\r\n_must be_ of the earlier debates on the new treatment. The finest of\r\nall these fossils is embedded in the _Saturday Review_ of 2nd Feb.\r\n1895--_It is a pity that the English Press should continue to be made\r\nthe cat's-paw of a gang of foreign medical adventurers._ To get at the\r\ntruth, we must reckon in thousands: take, out of a whole mass of\r\nevidence, all just alike, the reports from London, Berlin, Munich,\r\nVienna, Strasbourg, Cairo, Boston, and New York; these to begin with.\r\nOr the following facts, cut almost at random out of the medical\r\njournals:--\r\n\r\n   \"The medical report of the French army states that since the\r\n   introduction of the serum-treatment of diphtheria, the mortality\r\n   among cases of that disease had fallen from 11 per cent. to 6\r\n   per cent.\" (_Brit. Med. Journ._, 3rd September 1898.)\r\n\r\n\"Professor Krönlein (Zürich) exhibited statistical tables, showing\r\nthat the prevalence of diphtheria in the canton of Zürich had been\r\nnearly uniform during the past fifteen years; and that the mortality\r\nrapidly decreased as soon as antitoxic serum was used on a somewhat\r\nlarger scale. In his clinic, all the patients were examined\r\nbacteriologically, and serum was administered in every case of\r\ndiphtheria without exception. Of 1336 cases treated before the\r\nserum-period, 554 = 39.4 per cent. died; whilst during the\r\nserum-period there were 55 deaths among 437 cases = 12 per cent. In\r\ncases of tracheotomy, the death-rates before and during the\r\nserum-period were 66 and 38.8 per cent. respectively.\" (_Lancet_, 7th\r\nMay 1898, Report of German Surgical Congress at Berlin.)\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Kármán was entrusted by the Hungarian Government with the task of\r\ninstituting measures for preventing the spread of diphtheria in a\r\nvillage and its neighbourhood. As general hygienic regulations\r\naccomplished nothing, he tried preventive inoculation.... Among 114\r\nchildren thus treated, there was during the next two months no case of\r\ndiphtheria, although the disease was prevalent in the village up to\r\nthe date at which inoculation commenced, and continued to rage in the\r\nsurrounding villages afterwards. During those two months, only one\r\ncase of diphtheria appeared in the village, and that was in an\r\nuninoculated child; while, in the previous five months, 18.3 per cent.\r\nof the village children had been attacked, of whom eight died, six not\r\nhaving been treated with serum. Considering the wretched hygienic\r\ncondition of the village, the harmlessness of preventive inoculations,\r\nand the continuance of the disease in the neighbouring villages, where\r\ndiphtheria-vaccination was not carried out, the extraordinary value of\r\nthe inoculations, in the prophylaxis of diphtheria, can hardly be\r\ndenied.\" (_Brit. Med. Journ._, 16th January 1897.)\r\n\r\n   \"The most striking confirmation of the value of antitoxin has\r\n   been afforded where the supply ran short during an epidemic. In\r\n   Baginsky's clinic, the interruption of the serum-treatment\r\n   promptly raised the mortality from 15.6 to 48.4 per cent.\"\r\n   (_Brit. Med. Journ._, 20th October 1895.)\r\n\r\n   \"In an analysis of the ratio of mortality in 266 German cities\r\n   of about 15,000 inhabitants, it was found that the ratio of\r\n   mortality per 100,000 of the living, before antitoxin was used,\r\n   varied from 130 to 84 from 1886 to 1893, while the ratio from\r\n   1894 to 1897 varied from 101 to 35. It is a significant fact\r\n   that during 1894, when, although antitoxin was used to a certain\r\n   extent, it was not in general use, the ratio was 101; that when\r\n   antitoxin was used more extensively, in 1895, the ratio was 53;\r\n   that in 1896 it was 43; that in 1897, when antitoxin was very\r\n   generally used, the rate fell to 35.\" (_Trans. Massachusetts\r\n   Med. Soc._, 1898.)\r\n\r\n   \"Dr. Gabritchefski points out that in recent years the number of\r\n   persons (in Russia) attacked by the disease has increased, the\r\n   figures for the whole of Russia rising from about 100,000 or\r\n   120,000, ten years ago, to considerably over 200,000 in 1897.\r\n   The introduction of the serum treatment has, however, had a\r\n   marked effect on the mortality of the disease; and the actual\r\n   number of deaths from diphtheria has either not increased at\r\n   all, or has slightly diminished.\" (_Lancet_, 5th Aug. 1899.)\r\n\r\nOf course there will still be bad diphtheria years and good diphtheria\r\nyears: for example, the death-rate of the population of England, from\r\ndiphtheria, was higher during the years 1893-1899 than during the\r\nyears 1889-1892. Antitoxin can no more prevent a bad diphtheria year\r\nthan an umbrella can prevent a wet day. But in limited outbreaks of\r\ndiphtheria, such as occur in a village, an asylum, a school, or a\r\nlarge family of young children, it can be used, and is used, as a\r\nprophylactic, and with admirable results. The example of Dr. Kármán,\r\njust quoted, is one of the earliest instances of this preventive use\r\nof antitoxin: other instances, of equal importance, are given in the\r\n_Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, December 1897 and March 1898;\r\nand in the _Lancet_, 2nd April 1898, and 28th January 1899. A summary\r\nof later experiences of this preventive use of antitoxin in different\r\ncountries is given by Dr. Wilcox of New York, and Dr. Stevens of\r\nPhiladelphia, in Gould's _Year-Book_ for 1902:--\r\n\r\n   \"At a meeting of the Société de Pédiatrie (Paris), held June\r\n   1901, a resolution was adopted affirming that preventive\r\n   inoculations present no serious dangers, and confer immunity in\r\n   the great majority of cases for some weeks, and recommending\r\n   their employment in children's institutions and in families in\r\n   which scientific surveillance cannot be exercised. Netter stated\r\n   that he had collected 32,484 observations (cases) of\r\n   prophylactic injections, and after eliminating cases in which\r\n   the disease developed in less than twenty-four hours after\r\n   injection, or more than thirty days after, there were 6 per\r\n   cent. of failures. On the other hand, the author stated that he\r\n   had recently made ninety preventive injections with but 2.17 per\r\n   cent. of failures. Potter reports a series of twenty-four\r\n   families in which preventive injections were used. Only one case\r\n   of diphtheria occurred. In another series of cases, in which no\r\n   prophylactic injections were given, the disease occurred\r\n   secondarily in one-third of the houses, and one-sixth of the\r\n   inmates contracted the disease, in spite of the fact that a\r\n   large number of the primary cases were removed to the hospital.\r\n   Blake reports a series of thirty-five prophylactic injections.\r\n   The treatment was instituted after three cases of diphtheria had\r\n   developed in a children's home. No secondary cases developed.\r\n   Voisin and Guinon describe an epidemic of diphtheria in the\r\n   Salpetrière Hospital among idiots and epileptics. Prophylactic\r\n   injections were given to all those exposed to the contagion.\r\n   After that, but four cases appeared, all mild in character. One\r\n   severe case developed, however, two weeks later, ending fatally\r\n   in twenty-four hours, showing that the prophylactic action of\r\n   the antitoxin, while efficacious, is not of very long duration.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to prolong _ad infinitum_ the proofs of the curative\r\nand preventive efficacy of the antitoxin: it would be impossible to\r\nfind any evidence to be weighed for one moment against these proofs.\r\nThere are three early records that ought to be quoted more fully: the\r\n1894 report from the Hospital for Sick Children, Paris; the 1896\r\nreport of the American Pædiatric Society; and the 1898 report of the\r\nClinical Society of London.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe report from the Hospital for Sick Children, Paris, is contained in\r\na memoir, _Sérum-Thérapie de la Diphtérie_, the joint work of MM.\r\nRoux, Martin, and Chaillon (_Annales de l'Institut Pasteur_, September\r\n1894). It gives the results of the serum-treatment during February to\r\nJuly 1894. The cases were not selected: the antitoxin was given in\r\nevery case that was proved, by bacteriological examination, to be\r\ndiphtheria--with the exception of 20 cases where the children were\r\njust dying when they were brought to the hospital. No change was made\r\neither in the general treatment or in the local applications to the\r\nthroat; these were the same that had been used in former years: _le\r\nsérum est le seul élément nouveau introduit_.\r\n\r\nIn 1890-1893, before the serum-treatment, 3971 children were admitted\r\nto the diphtheria wards, and 2029 of them died. The percentage of\r\nthese deaths was--\r\n\r\n    In 1890      55.88 }\r\n     \" 1891      52.45 } Average = 51.71.\r\n     \" 1892      47.64 }\r\n     \" 1893      48.47 }\r\n\r\nThe serum was used from 1st February to 24th July 1894. During this\r\nperiod 448 children were admitted, of whom 109 died = 24.5.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period (February to June) the Trousseau Hospital,\r\nwhere the serum was not used, had 520 cases, with 316 deaths = 60.0.\r\n\r\nThe cases at the Hospital for Sick Children must be divided into those\r\nthat required tracheotomy and those that did not require it:--\r\n\r\nMORTALITY AMONG CASES NOT REQUIRING TRACHEOTOMY.\r\n\r\n    In 1890        47.30 }\r\n     \" 1891        46.64 } Average = 33.94.\r\n     \" 1892        38.8  }\r\n     \" 1893        32.02 }\r\n\r\nDuring the serum-period, the mortality of these cases was 12.0. At the\r\nTrousseau Hospital, without the serum, the mortality of these cases\r\nduring the same period was 32.0.\r\n\r\nMORTALITY AMONG CASES REQUIRING TRACHEOTOMY.\r\n\r\n    In 1890        76.35 }\r\n     \" 1891        68.36 } Average = 73.49.\r\n     \" 1892        74.6  }\r\n     \" 1893        73.45 }\r\n\r\nDuring the serum-period, the mortality of these cases was 49.0. At the\r\nTrousseau Hospital, without the serum, the mortality of these cases\r\nduring the same period was 86.0.\r\n\r\nSetting aside, out of the 448 children, those cases of \"membranous\r\nsore throat\" or \"pseudo-diphtheria,\" in which the Klebs-Loeffler\r\nbacillus was not found, there remain 320 cases where it was found. Of\r\nthese 320 children, 20 were just dying on admission, and did not\r\nreceive the serum. Of the 300 who received it, 78 died = 26.0. Before\r\nthe serum-period, the mortality of these cases at the same hospital\r\nwas about 50.0. The complications of diphtheria, such as paralysis,\r\nwere much less frequent during the serum-period than they had been\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nReport of the American Pædiatric Society's Collective Investigation\r\ninto the use of Antitoxin in the treatment of diphtheria in private\r\npractice. (Eighth Annual Meeting, Montreal, May 1896.) From the _New\r\nYork Medical Record_, 4th July 1896.\r\n\r\nThis vast collection of cases is of special interest, because they\r\noccurred in private practice. In most of them the nature of the\r\ndisease was proved by bacteriological examination; in the rest, the\r\nclinical evidence was decisive: \"It is possible that among the latter\r\nwe have admitted some streptococcus cases, but the number of such is\r\ncertainly very small.\" All other doubtful cases, 244 in number, were\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nThree thousand three hundred and eighty-four cases were reported by\r\n613 physicians from 114 cities and towns, in 15 different States, the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the Dominion of Canada. To these 3384 cases\r\nwere added 942 cases from tenement-houses in New York, and 1468 cases\r\nfrom tenement-houses in Chicago. The New York and Chicago cases were,\r\nmost of them, treated by a corps of inspectors of the Health Board of\r\nthe city; and the municipal surveillance was very strict at Chicago:--\r\n\r\n   \"There are very few hospitals in America that receive diphtheria\r\n   patients.... It was the custom in Chicago to send an inspector\r\n   to every tenement-house case reported, and to administer the\r\n   serum unless it was refused by the parents. These cases were\r\n   therefore treated much earlier, and the results were\r\n   correspondingly better than were obtained in New York, although\r\n   the serum used was the same in both cities, viz., that of the\r\n   New York Health Board.\"\r\n\r\nThe sum total of results was 5794 cases, with 713 deaths = 12.3 per\r\ncent., including every case returned; but 218 were moribund at the\r\ntime of injection, or died within twenty-four hours of the first\r\ninjection. \"Should these be excluded, there would remain 5576 cases in\r\nwhich the serum may be said to have had a chance, with a mortality of\r\n8.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Of  996 cases injected\r\n                   on the first day of the disease,  49 died =  4.9%\r\n     \" 1616   \"    on the second           \"        120   \"  =  7.4\"\r\n     \" 1508   \"    on the third            \"        134   \"  =  8.8\"\r\n     \"  758   \"    on the fourth           \"        147   \"  = 20.7\"\r\n     \"  690   \"    on or after the fifth   \"        244   \"  = 35.3\"\r\n\r\nAnd in 232 cases, where the day of injection was unknown, there were\r\n19 deaths = 8.2 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"No one feature of the cases of diphtheria treated by antitoxin has\r\nexcited more surprise among the physicians who have reported them than\r\nthe prompt arrest, by the timely administration of the serum, of\r\nmembrane which was rapidly spreading downward below the larynx. Such\r\nexpressions abound in the reports as 'wonderful,' 'marvellous,' 'in\r\nall my experience with diphtheria, have never seen anything like it\r\nbefore,' etc.\r\n\r\n\"Turning now to the operative cases, we find the same remarkable\r\neffects of the antitoxin noticeable. Operations were done in 565\r\ncases, or in 16.7 per cent. of the entire number reported. Intubation\r\nwas performed 533 times, with 138 deaths, or a mortality of 25.9 per\r\ncent. In the above are included 9 cases in which a secondary\r\ntracheotomy was done, with 7 deaths. In 32, tracheotomy only was done,\r\nwith 12 deaths, a mortality of 37.4 per cent. Of the 565 operative\r\ncases, 66 were either moribund at the time of operation or died within\r\ntwenty-four hours after injection. Should these be deducted, there\r\nremain 499 cases operated upon, by intubation or tracheotomy, with 84\r\ndeaths, a mortality of 16.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"Let us compare the results of intubation, in cases in which the serum\r\nwas used, with those obtained with this operation before the serum was\r\nintroduced. Of 5546 intubation cases in the practice of 242\r\nphysicians, collected by M'Naughton and Maddren (1892), the mortality\r\nwas 69.5 per cent. Since that time, statistics have improved\r\nmaterially by the general use (in and about New York, at least) of\r\ncalomel fumigations. With this addition, the best results published\r\n(those of Brown) showed in 279 cases a mortality of 51.6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"But even these figures do not adequately express the benefit of\r\nantitoxin in laryngeal cases. Witness the fact that over one-half the\r\nlaryngeal cases did not require operation at all. Formerly, 10 per\r\ncent. of recoveries was the record for laryngeal cases not operated\r\nupon. Surely, if it does nothing else, the serum saves at least double\r\nthe number of cases of laryngeal diphtheria that has been saved by any\r\nother method of treatment.\"\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn 1898, the Clinical Society published the Report of their Special\r\nCommittee, based on 633 cases (_Trans. Clin. Soc._, xxxi., 1898, pp.\r\n1-50). The whole report should be read carefully; but there is room\r\nhere for nothing more than the latter part of it. This is given at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n_Table showing the General Mortality of cases treated, on the same day\r\nof the disease, with and without Antitoxin._\r\n\r\n    +----------------------------++---------------------------++----------+\r\n    |                            ||METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD ||          |\r\n    |    ANTITOXIN COMMITTEE:    ||          1894:            ||Difference|\r\n    |     633 Cases treated      ||3042 Cases treated without ||   of     |\r\n    |      with Antitoxin.       ||        Antitoxin.         ||  Per-    |\r\n    +----------------------------++---------------------------++ centage. |\r\n    |Day of the|  C  |  D  |  M  || Day of  |  C  |  D  |  M  ||          |\r\n    |Disease on|  a  |  e  |  o  ||Admission|  a  |  e  |  o  ||          |\r\n    |which     |  s  |  a  |  r  ||   to    |  s  |  a  |  r  ||          |\r\n    |Treatment |  e  |  t  |  t  ||Hospital.|  e  |  t  |  t  ||          |\r\n    |was begun.|  s. |  h  |  i  ||         |  s. |  h  |  a  ||          |\r\n    |          |     |  s. |  l  ||         |     |  s. |  l  ||          |\r\n    |          |     |     |  i  ||         |     |     |  i  ||          |\r\n    |          |     |     |  t  ||         |     |     |  t  ||          |\r\n    |          |     |     |  y  ||         |     |     |  y  ||          |\r\n    |          |     |     |     ||         |     |     |     ||          |\r\n    |          |     |     |  %. ||         |     |     |  %. ||          |\r\n    +----------+-----+-----+-----++---------+-----+-----+-----++----------+\r\n    |    1st   |  20 |   2 | 10.0||   1st   |  133|  30 | 22.5||   12.5   |\r\n    |    2nd   |  92 |  10 | 10.8||   2nd   |  539| 146 | 27.0||   16.2   |\r\n    |    3rd   | 133 |  20 | 15.0||   3rd   |  652| 192 | 29.4||   14.4   |\r\n    |    4th   | 130 |  26 | 20.0||   4th   |  566| 179 | 31.6||   11.6   |\r\n    |    5th   | 258 |  66 | 25.5||   5th   |1,152| 355 | 30.8||    5.3   |\r\n    |and after.|     |     |     ||         |     |     |     ||          |\r\n    +----------+-----+-----+-----++---------+-----+-----+-----++----------+\r\n    |  Totals  | 633 | 124 | 19.5||  Totals |3,042| 902 | 29.6||   10.1   |\r\n    +----------+-----+-----+-----++---------+-----+-----+-----++----------+\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\n_Summary and Conclusions of the Committee's Report_\r\n\r\n   \"The material for the investigation of the clinical value of the\r\n   antitoxin serum in the treatment of diphtheria was not obtained\r\n   from selected, but from consecutive, cases, reported from the\r\n   general hospitals and the fever hospitals of the Metropolitan\r\n   Asylums Board; all were made use of which fulfilled the\r\n   requirements of the Committee.\r\n\r\n   \"The Committee rejected all cases in which satisfactory proof of\r\n   the existence of true diphtheria was not shown, either by the\r\n   presence of the _Bacillus diphtheriæ_ upon bacteriological\r\n   examination, or by the occurrence of paralysis in the course of\r\n   the illness. All were also rejected in which the amount of\r\n   antitoxin administered was stated in cubic centimetres and not\r\n   in normal units, the Committee having no means by which the\r\n   strength of the antitoxin could in these cases be determined.\r\n\r\n   \"Six hundred and thirty-three cases form the basis on which the\r\n   report is drawn up; 549 were treated with antitoxin obtained\r\n   from the laboratory of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and\r\n   Surgeons; the remainder, 84 in number, were injected with\r\n   antitoxin obtained from other sources. In nine instances,\r\n   antitoxin from two different sources was injected into the same\r\n   patient.\r\n\r\n   \"Statistics of the disease before the use of antitoxin are\r\n   introduced as control series; these were obtained from the fever\r\n   hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and from the\r\n   general hospitals; and, like the antitoxin series, are compiled\r\n   from consecutive and not from selected cases.\r\n\r\n   \"The general mortality, under the antitoxin treatment, was 19.5\r\n   per cent.; a reduction of 10 on the percentage mortality of the\r\n   cases treated in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board\r\n   in 1894. If 15 fatal cases, in which death took place within\r\n   twenty-four hours of the first injection, be deducted, the\r\n   mortality falls to 15.6 per cent.; which is very little more\r\n   than half the mortality during 1894 under other forms of\r\n   treatment.\r\n\r\n   \"The lessened mortality is especially noticeable in the earlier\r\n   years of life, the percentage mortality of children under five\r\n   being 26.3, as opposed to 47.4. In the next period of five\r\n   years, the percentage of mortality is 16.0, as opposed to 26.0;\r\n   whilst after ten years of age the difference in the mortality is\r\n   slight.[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] After childhood, the disease is much less fatal.\r\n\r\n   \"Laryngeal diphtheria is admittedly the most dangerous form. The\r\n   laryngeal cases have a percentage mortality of 23.6 in the\r\n   antitoxin, as compared with 66.0 in the non-antitoxin series. In\r\n   the cases in which laryngeal symptoms are so severe as to\r\n   necessitate tracheotomy, the saving of life by the use of\r\n   antitoxin is very marked, the mortality being reduced one-half,\r\n   to 36.0 as opposed to 71.6 per cent.\r\n\r\n   \"The strongest evidence of the value of the antitoxin treatment\r\n   is that, in addition to reducing the general mortality by\r\n   one-third, the duration of life in the fatal cases is decidedly\r\n   prolonged. These two facts taken together conclusively prove the\r\n   beneficial effects of the antitoxin treatment.\r\n\r\n   \"The incidence of paralysis is greater in the antitoxin than in\r\n   the control series. This increased number is partly explained by\r\n   the lessened mortality, and partly by the longer duration of\r\n   life in the fatal cases affording time for the development of\r\n   paralytic symptoms. The percentage mortality of those who had\r\n   some form or other of paralysis is lower in the antitoxin than\r\n   in the control series; so that, notwithstanding the apparent\r\n   greater risk of paralysis supervening, the probability of final\r\n   recovery is greater.\r\n\r\n   \"No definite conclusion can be drawn, for the reasons stated in\r\n   the body of the report, as to the advantage of administering the\r\n   whole of the antitoxin within forty-eight hours of the first\r\n   injection, or continuing it for a longer period; but evidence is\r\n   afforded of the importance of its administration as early as\r\n   possible in the course of the disease; the percentage mortality\r\n   in cases injected on the first and second days of the disease\r\n   being 10.7, as compared with 25.5 for those first receiving the\r\n   injection on the fifth or some subsequent day.\r\n\r\n   \"No conclusion can be drawn, from the cases reported on, as to\r\n   the amount of antitoxin which should be used to produce the best\r\n   effects; but they show that the administration of very large\r\n   doses is followed by no pronounced ill effects.\r\n\r\n   \"The injection of antitoxin is responsible for the production of\r\n   rashes, joint-pains, and possibly for the occurrence of late\r\n   pyrexia. In 34.7 per cent. the injections were followed by\r\n   rashes. Some amount of fever accompanied the rash in 60 per\r\n   cent. In only 9.4 per cent. of those in whom rashes were\r\n   observed did death ensue.\r\n\r\n   \"Joint-pains were observed in 40, or 6.3 per cent. of the whole\r\n   number, and all but five of them had a rash as well.\r\n\r\n   \"In 26, or 65 per cent. of the joint-pains, some rise of\r\n   temperature accompanied the pain. A rise of temperature during\r\n   convalescence, accompanied by either rash or joint-pain,\r\n   occurred in 27, or 4.2 per cent. of the whole number.\r\n\r\n   \"No connection could be traced between the amount of antitoxin\r\n   administered and the occurrence of rashes or late pyrexia, but\r\n   the pain in and about the joints appears to have a relationship\r\n   to the amount of antitoxin used.\r\n\r\n   \"The results of the Committee's investigation tend to show that\r\n   by the use of antitoxin--\r\n\r\n   1. The general mortality is reduced by one-third.\r\n\r\n   2. The mortality in tracheotomy falls by one-half.\r\n\r\n   3. Extension of membrane to the larynx very rarely occurs after\r\n   the administration of antitoxin.\r\n\r\n   4. The duration of life in the fatal cases is decidedly\r\n   prolonged.\r\n\r\n   5. The number of fatal cases is less when antitoxin is used\r\n   early in the illness than in those which do not receive it until\r\n   a later period.\r\n\r\n   6. The frequency of the occurrence of paralysis is not\r\n   diminished, but the percentage of recoveries in cases with\r\n   paralysis is slightly increased.[22]\r\n\r\n   7. Rashes are produced in about one-third of the cases, and are\r\n   attributable to the antitoxin.\r\n\r\n   8. Pain, and occasionally swelling about the joints, are\r\n   produced in a number of cases.\r\n\r\n   9. Even when used in large doses, no serious ill effects have\r\n   followed the injection of antitoxin.\"\r\n\r\n  [22] For an exhaustive and wise study of the diphtheritic\r\n  paralyses, see Dr. Woollacott's essay in the _Lancet_, 26th August\r\n  1899: \"The use of antitoxic serum in the treatment of diphtheria\r\n  has, up to the present time, in the London fever hospitals, had\r\n  two main results--the death-rate has fallen, while the\r\n  paralysis-rate has risen. In the hospitals of the Metropolitan\r\n  Asylums Board, the former has been reduced from 29 per cent. to\r\n  15.3 per cent., while the latter has risen from 13 per cent. to as\r\n  high as 21 per cent. in 1896. This increase of paralysis is\r\n  chiefly due to the fact that many more patients now recover from\r\n  the primary disease, and live long enough for paralysis to show\r\n  itself. _During the last two years, however, the occurrence of\r\n  paralysis has begun to diminish in frequency.... The earlier\r\n  antitoxin is given in diphtheria, the less likely is paralysis to\r\n  follow._\" It is to be borne in mind that post-diphtheritic\r\n  paralysis, in the great majority of cases, affects only a very\r\n  small group of muscles; of Dr. Woollacott's tabulated cases, 377\r\n  were of this kind, and 97 were severe. And \"the type of paralysis\r\n  has, on the whole, become less severe, or at all events less\r\n  dangerous to life.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reports belong to ancient history. Let us leave them,\r\nand study the record of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums\r\nBoard. They serve a city of 121 square miles, and 4-1/2 millions of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe use of the antitoxin in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums\r\nBoard began in 1895. It had been used in 1894 on a few cases only,\r\nduring the latter part of the year, and had been procured with much\r\ndifficulty from various sources, chiefly from the Institute of\r\nPreventive Medicine. On 9th November 1894, the Board applied to the\r\nLaboratories' Committee of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of\r\nSurgeons, asking them to undertake the supply. Arrangements were made\r\nfor this purpose; and the sum of £1000 was given by the Goldsmiths'\r\nCompany. Dr. Sims Woodhead, then Director of the Laboratories of the\r\nConjoint Colleges, now Professor of Pathology at Cambridge, was put in\r\ncharge of the bacteriological work and the preparation of the serum,\r\nwith a host of expert colleagues: the administration of the treatment\r\nwas the work of the medical officers of the hospitals of the\r\nMetropolitan Asylums Board. The experiences of 1895 are given in the\r\nfollowing passages from the joint report to the Board from the medical\r\nsuperintendents:--\r\n\r\n   \"The period covered by the report extends from 1st January 1895\r\n   to 31st December of the same year. During this time--with the\r\n   exception of an interval of three months at the Eastern\r\n   Hospital, when its use was suspended; of three months at the\r\n   Fountain, and to a considerable extent throughout the year at\r\n   the South-Eastern Hospital, when all cases were consecutively\r\n   treated, irrespective of their severity--the serum was\r\n   administered _only to cases which at the time of admission were\r\n   severe, or which threatened to become so_. In a certain number,\r\n   the patients being moribund at the time of their arrival, and\r\n   beyond the reach of any treatment, no antitoxin was given. _No\r\n   change has taken place during the year in the local treatment of\r\n   the cases, nor has there been any new factor in the treatment\r\n   other than the injection of antitoxin_.\r\n\r\n   \"It must be clearly understood that, with the exceptions\r\n   previously stated, it has been the practice at each of the\r\n   hospitals to administer serum to _those cases only in which the\r\n   symptoms on admission were sufficiently pronounced to give rise\r\n   to anxiety, the mild cases not receiving any_.\r\n\r\n   \"_No less than 46.4 per cent. of the antitoxin cases were under\r\n   five years of age, against 32.5 per cent. in the non-antitoxin\r\n   group_; and only 16.1 per cent. in the former class were over\r\n   ten years of age, against 33.8 per cent. in the latter. The high\r\n   fatality of diphtheria in the earlier years of life is\r\n   notorious.\r\n\r\n   \"It is obvious, therefore, that to compare the mortality of\r\n   those treated with antitoxin with that of those which during the\r\n   same period were not so treated, would be to institute a\r\n   comparison between the severe cases and those of which a large\r\n   proportion were mild. This would clearly be misleading.\r\n\r\n   \"The only method by which an accurate estimate can be obtained\r\n   as to the merits of any particular form of treatment, is by\r\n   comparing a series of cases in which the remedy has been\r\n   employed with another series not so treated, but which are\r\n   similar, so far as can be, in other respects. This, in the\r\n   present instance, is impossible; but, having regard to the fact\r\n   that 61.8 of the 1895 cases were treated with serum, an\r\n   approximately accurate conclusion can be drawn by contrasting\r\n   all cases of diphtheria completed during 1895, the antitoxin\r\n   period, with all cases completed during 1894.\r\n\r\n   \"The year 1894 has been selected for the purpose of comparison,\r\n   not only because it is the year immediately preceding the\r\n   antitoxin period, but because the average severity of the cases\r\n   has been, in our opinion, about equal. Moreover, the death-rate\r\n   in 1894 was slightly lower than it had been in any previous\r\n   year.\r\n\r\n   \" ... Of 3042 patients of all ages treated during 1894, 902\r\n   died--a mortality of 29.6 per cent.; whereas, of 3529 cases\r\n   treated during 1895, 796 died--a mortality of 22.6 per cent.;\r\n   the difference in percentage between the two rates being\r\n   therefore 7.1.

From this time onwards, the chance of a successful\r\n   issue will diminish in proportion to the length of time which\r\n   has elapsed before the treatment is commenced. This, though\r\n   doubtless true of other methods, is of still greater moment in\r\n   the case of treatment by antitoxin.\r\n\r\n   \"Certain secondary effects not unfrequently arise as a direct\r\n   result of the injection of antitoxin in the form in which it has\r\n   at present to be administered, and even assuming that the\r\n   incidence of the normal complications of diphtheria is greater\r\n   than can be accounted for by the increased number of\r\n   recoveries, we have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that\r\n   these drawbacks are insignificant when taken in conjunction with\r\n   the lessened fatality which has been associated with the use of\r\n   this remedy.\r\n\r\n   \"We are further of the opinion that in antitoxic serum we\r\n   possess a remedy of distinctly greater value in the treatment of\r\n   diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow let us take the whole record of all the hospitals together.

He divides these nine\r\nyears into a \"pre-serum period,\" an \"introduction year,\" and a \"serum\r\nperiod.\" In the pre-serum period the general mortality was 41.5, and\r\nthe mortality of cases requiring operation was 60; in the serum\r\nperiod, the general mortality was 16.5, and the mortality of cases\r\nrequiring operation was 37.5.\r\n\r\nAny bad results that have been recorded from the use of the antitoxin\r\nare so rare, in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of\r\ninjections made, that they do not come to be considered here. And,\r\neven though a few have occurred, we may be sure that some of them were\r\ndue, not to the antitoxin, but to the natural course of the\r\ndisease.[23] The lesser drawbacks, the occurrence of joint pains and\r\nof rashes, are transient and in no way serious.\r\n\r\n  [23] This, of course, does not apply to two instances, in 1901, of\r\n  accidental contamination of serum. See, for an account of these,\r\n  _The British Medical Journal_, November 1901.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, and said, that the use of the antitoxin\r\nincreases the complications of the disease. On this point, the best\r\nauthority is Professor Woodhead's monumental Report (1901), dealing\r\nwith the Metropolitan Asylums Board cases for 1895 and 1896. He sums\r\nup the matter thus:--\r\n\r\n   \"The free use of antitoxin does not raise the percentage of\r\n   cases of albuminuria. As regards vomiting, the statistics give\r\n   little information, as vomiting is usually met with only in the\r\n   very severe cases. This also holds good of anuria. The number of\r\n   cases of adenitis appears to be distinctly reduced by the use of\r\n   antitoxin, as the percentage of cases falls as the injections of\r\n   antitoxin are pushed. The use of antitoxin has also had a\r\n   perceptible effect in diminishing the cases of nephritis, and it\r\n   certainly has not aggravated the kidney complications of\r\n   diphtheria. There can be no doubt that in cases treated with\r\n   antitoxin there is a greater percentage of cases in which\r\n   joint-pains occur than in cases not so treated; these, however,\r\n   are transitory, and are probably the result of some slight\r\n   change in the blood set up by the action of the serum itself,\r\n   and not by the antitoxic substance in the serum. The number of\r\n   primary abscesses has undoubtedly been reduced by the use of\r\n   antitoxin. It may also be accepted that antitoxic serum has some\r\n   effect in temporarily raising the temperature, but only during\r\n   the periods of joint-pains and serum rashes; all these, however,\r\n   are of comparatively slight importance as compared with the\r\n   effect the antitoxin has in diminishing the percentage mortality\r\n   and alleviating the more severe symptoms.\r\n\r\n   \"It is of importance to observe that amongst the cases of\r\n   paralysis following diphtheria the death-rate (32 per cent.) was\r\n   actually higher amongst those not injected with antitoxin than\r\n   amongst those where antitoxin was used (30.5 per cent.),\r\n   although the former paralyses must be looked upon as being the\r\n   result of a comparatively mild attack of the disease. From this\r\n   it is evident that, when once paralysis supervenes in these\r\n   cases, it is quite as fatal in its effects as in the cases\r\n   (usually those of a more severe type) where antitoxin has been\r\n   given. Antitoxin _cannot cure_ the degeneration of the nerve,\r\n   but it _can neutralise_ the diphtheria toxin, and so put a stop\r\n   to the advance of the degenerative changes due to its action. In\r\n   1896, when, of course, antitoxin was given much more freely, the\r\n   percentage of deaths in the non-injected cases where paralysis\r\n   had come on fell to 18.4.\r\n\r\n   \"Antitoxin rashes occur at a comparatively late stage of the\r\n   disease. They cannot be looked upon as in any way dangerous,\r\n   although the secondary rise of temperature, and the irritation\r\n   of the skin which usually accompany their presence are very\r\n   undesirable complications, and may retard somewhat the\r\n   convalescence of nervous and irritable patients.\r\n\r\n   \"Antitoxin appears to diminish the liability of the lungs to\r\n   inflammatory change in severe attacks of diphtheria.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow let us take another point of view. If anybody really doubts whether\r\nthe antitoxin did really save these lives in the hospitals of the\r\nMetropolitan Asylums Board, what answer has he got to the following\r\ntable? It is published in the Board's Report for 1904, and was drawn\r\nup by Dr. MacCombie, Medical Superintendent of the Brook Hospital. It\r\nshows the supreme importance of giving the antitoxin _at the very\r\nbeginning of the disease_. The figures in brackets are the total\r\nnumbers of the cases in the eight years:--\r\n\r\n_Percentage Mortality according to Time of coming under Treatment._\r\n\r\n    +---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n    |Day of Disease.|1897.|1898.|1899.|1900.|1901.|1902.|1903.|1904.|\r\n    +---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n    |(204) 1st      |  0.0|  0.0|  0.0|  0.0|  0.0|  0.0|  0.0| 0.0 |\r\n    |(1278) 2nd     |  5.4|  5.0|  3.8|  3.6|  4.1|  4.6|  4.2| 5.43|\r\n    |(1374) 3rd     | 11.5| 14.3| 12.2|  6.7| 11.9| 10.5| 17.6|10.63|\r\n    |(1086) 4th     | 19.0| 18.1| 20.0| 14.9| 12.4| 19.8| 16.7|19.51|\r\n    |(1382) 5th     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n    | and after     | 21.0| 22.5| 20.4| 21.2| 16.6| 19.4| 17.3|13.11|\r\n    +---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nHere we see that in 1482 patients, who got the antitoxin within\r\nforty-eight hours of the onset of the disease, the mortality was 2-1/4\r\nper cent. In 1278 patients, who did not get the antitoxin till the\r\nthird day, the mortality was 11-3/4 per cent. That is the result of\r\none day's delay over sending the child into hospital.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not only lives that are saved, but suffering that is\r\navoided. Just lately, at a meeting of the Chelsea Clinical Society\r\n(May 1906), reference was made to this point by Dr. Foord Caiger,\r\nMedical Superintendent of the South-Western Hospital. \"The number of\r\ntracheotomies is less than half what it used to be;\" and again,\r\n\"Instead of the spectacle of a number of patients in great distress,\r\nwith swollen necks and stuffed-up noses, fretful and crying, such\r\ncases are now quite the exception, and, in the few one does come\r\nacross, the condition lasts for a comparatively short time.\" And\r\nagain, \"It was quite unusual (before 1895) for a nurse to care to stay\r\nvery long in charge of one of the diphtheria wards, because she found\r\nthe work so depressing. But nowadays the diphtheria wards are perhaps\r\nthe most popular in the hospital, a fact which is mainly owing to the\r\nchange in the general aspect of the patients and the greatly reduced\r\nmortality.\" (_Clinical Journal_, May 23, 1906.)\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTETANUS\r\n\r\nBefore bacteriology, the cause of tetanus (lock-jaw) was unknown, and\r\nmen were free to imagine that it was due to inflammation travelling up\r\nan injured nerve to the central nervous system. This false and\r\nmischievous theory was abolished by the experimental work of Sternberg\r\n(1880), Carle and Rattone (1884), and Nicolaier (1884), who proved,\r\nonce and for all, that the disease is an infection by a specific\r\nflagellate organism. Their work was of the utmost difficulty, for many\r\nreasons. First, because tetanus, in some tropical countries, is so\r\ncommon that it may fairly be called endemic; and many of these\r\ntropical cases, there being no record of any external infection, had\r\nbeen taken as evidence that the disease can occur \"of itself.\" Of this\r\nfrequency of tetanus in tropical countries, Sir Patrick Manson, in his\r\nbook on _Tropical Diseases_ (1898), says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Tetanus is an exceedingly common disease in some tropical\r\n   countries. In Western Africa, for example, a large proportion of\r\n   wounds, no matter how trifling as wounds they may be, if they\r\n   are fouled by earth or dirt, result in tetanus. The French in\r\n   Senegambia have found this to their cost. A gentleman who had\r\n   travelled much in Congoland told me that certain tribes poison\r\n   their arrows by simply dipping the tips in a particular kind of\r\n   mud. A wound from these arrows is nearly sure to cause tetanus.\r\n   In many countries, so general and so extensive is the\r\n   distribution of the tetanus-bacillus that trismus neonatorum\r\n   (tetanus of newly-born infants) is a principal cause of the\r\n   excessive infant mortality.\"\r\n\r\nNext, because the tetanus-bacillus has its natural abode in the\r\nsuperficial layers of the soil: here it is associated with a vast\r\nnumber of other organisms, so that its identification and isolation\r\nwere a work of immeasurable complexity. What mixed company it keeps,\r\nis shown by Houston's estimate of the number of microbes per gramme in\r\ntwenty-one samples of different soils. This number ranged from 8326 in\r\nvirgin sand, and 475,282 in virgin peat, to 115,014,492 in the soil\r\nfrom the trench of a sewage-farm. In all rich and well-manured soil\r\nthe tetanus-bacillus may possibly be present; but it was the work of\r\nyears to dissociate it from the myriads of organisms outnumbering it.\r\n\r\nNext, because it cannot be got to grow in cultures exposed to the air:\r\nits proper place is below the surface of the soil, away from the air;\r\nit is \"strictly anaërobic,\" and the attempts to cultivate it by\r\nordinary methods failed again and again. It had to be cultivated below\r\nthe surface of certain nutrient media, or in a special atmosphere of\r\nnitrogen or hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThese and other difficulties for many years delayed the final proof of\r\nthe true pathology of tetanus. The success of the work was mainly due\r\nto Nicolaier. He started from the well-known fact that tetanus mostly\r\ncomes of wounds or scratches contaminated with particles of\r\nearth--such mischances as the grinding of dirt or gravel into the\r\nskin, or the tearing of it by a splinter of wood or a rusty nail; as\r\nDr. Poore says, in his Milroy Lectures (1899), \"Every child who falls\r\non the ground and gets an abrasion of the skin, all tillers of the\r\nsoil who get accidental wounds in the course of duty, and every horse\r\nwhich 'breaks its knees' by falling in the London streets, runs\r\npotentially a risk of inoculation with tetanus.\" Nicolaier therefore\r\nstudied the various microbes of the soil, and made inoculations of\r\ngarden-mould under the skin of rabbits. He was able, by these\r\ninoculations, to produce tetanus in them; and the discharge from the\r\npoints of inoculation, put under the skin of other rabbits, produced\r\nthe disease again. He also identified the bacillus, and cultivated it;\r\nbut in these cultures it was mixed with other organisms, and he failed\r\nto isolate it from them. Carle and Rattone, and Rosenbach, were able\r\nto produce tetanus in animals by inoculating them with discharge from\r\nthe wounds of patients attacked by the disease. Finally, Kitasato, in\r\n1889, found a way of obtaining pure cultures of the bacillus.\r\nBeginning with impure cultures such as Nicolaier had made, he kept\r\nthese at a temperature of 36° C. till the bacillus had spored; then,\r\nby repeated exposures of the cultures to a temperature of 80° C. for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour at a time, he killed-off all organisms\r\nexcept the spores of the tetanus-bacillus; then he kept these in an\r\natmosphere of hydrogen, at a temperature of 20° C., and thus got pure\r\ncultures.\r\n\r\nBrieger, Fränkel, Cohen, Sidney Martin, Kanthack, and others, have\r\nstudied the chemical products of the disease, have obtained them from\r\ncultures and from infected tissues, and have been able with these\r\ntoxins to produce the disease in animals. As with the other infective\r\ndiseases, so with tetanus, there have been two main lines of\r\nresearches; the one, toward a fuller knowledge of the chemical changes\r\nin the blood and in the central nervous system; the other, toward a\r\nfuller knowledge of the nature and ways of the bacillus, and its\r\nmethod of invasion. Before any study of immunity or immunisation, or\r\nof neutralisation of the toxins in man by an antitoxin, came the study\r\nof the toxins and of the bacillus. It was proved, by an immense\r\nquantity of hard work, that the bacillus does not tend to invade the\r\nblood, or to pass beyond the lymphatic glands in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the site of inoculation; that it stays in and about\r\nthe wound, and there multiplies, and from this site pours into the\r\nblood the chemical products which cause the disease; and that these\r\nchemical substances have a selective action on certain nerve-cells in\r\nthe brain and the spinal cord. This is the bare outline of the facts;\r\nand no account can be given here of the intricate problems of\r\nbacteriology and animal chemistry that have been answered, or are\r\nstill waiting an answer. At least, it is evident that the whole\r\npathology of tetanus was found, proved, and interpreted by the help of\r\nexperiments on animals; and that these alone did away with the old\r\nfalse doctrine that the disease was due to rapid extension of\r\ninflammation up a nerve to the brain.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 came the use of an antitoxin in cases of the disease, and, in\r\n1895, 42 cases were reported, with 27 recoveries. It cannot be said\r\nthat any one of the diverse preparations of tetanus-antitoxin, up to\r\nthis present time, has triumphed over the disease. Tetanus is of all\r\ndiseases the hardest to reckon with: the first sign of it is the last\r\nstage of it; there is no warning, nothing, it may be, but a healed\r\nscratch, till the central nervous system is affected with sudden and\r\nrapidly advancing degeneration of certain cells. These and other\r\ndifficulties have stood in the way of an antitoxin treatment; and\r\nthere is no less difficulty in estimating the efficacy of that\r\ntreatment. The recovery, under antitoxin, of a \"chronic\" case cannot\r\nalways or altogether be attributed to the treatment; and in a very\r\nacute case, antitoxin, like everything else, has but small chance of\r\nsuccess. Various reports on the antitoxin treatment, published during\r\n1897-1899, give the following figures:--\r\n\r\n    26 cases, with 12 recoveries.\r\n    98      \"      57     \"\r\n    36      \"      25     \"\r\n    22      \"      11     \"\r\n    51      \"      36     \"\r\n    10      \"       7     \"\r\n\r\nProbably the paper by Dr. Lambert of New York, in the _Medical News_,\r\nJuly 1900, gives fairly the general opinion of the treatment, so far\r\nas the subcutaneous administration of antitoxin is concerned:--\r\n\r\n   \"The following cases of tetanus, treated with antitoxin,\r\n   comprise published and unpublished cases. We have a total of 279\r\n   cases, with a mortality of 44.08 per cent.: but of these we must\r\n   rule out 17 cases--4 deaths from intercurrent diseases, 8 deaths\r\n   in cases in which the antitoxin was given but a few hours before\r\n   death, and 5 recoveries in which antitoxin was not given until\r\n   after the twelfth day (as they probably would have recovered\r\n   without it). We have left 262 cases, with 151 recoveries, and\r\n   111 deaths, a mortality of 42.36 per cent. Dividing the cases\r\n   into acute and chronic, we have 124 acute cases, with 35\r\n   recoveries and 89 deaths, a mortality of 71.77 per cent., and\r\n   138 chronic cases, with 116 recoveries and 22 deaths, a\r\n   mortality of 15.94 per cent. In interpreting critically these\r\n   statistics, we see that in acute cases the mortality is but\r\n   slightly reduced, being but 72 per cent. instead of 88 per cent.\r\n   But, in the less acute cases, there is a decided improvement,\r\n   from 40 per cent. to 16 per cent. Taking the statistics as a\r\n   whole, there is a distinct improvement in the mortality of\r\n   tetanus since the introduction of antitoxin.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be foreign to the present purpose to pursue this matter\r\nfurther: for the other treatments, used by Baccelli and by Krokiewicz,\r\nand the sub-dural use of antitoxin, are also founded on experiments on\r\nanimals; and the same will be true of any better method that shall be\r\ndeveloped out of them.\r\n\r\nThe _preventive_ use of the tetanus-antitoxin, for the immunisation of\r\nhuman beings or of animals, has given excellent results. Horses are\r\nvery apt to be infected by tetanus; and the antitoxin has been used in\r\nveterinary practice, both for prevention and for cure. The curative\r\nresults are not, at present, very good. But, as regards protection\r\nagainst the disease, there is evidence that horses can be immunised\r\nagainst tetanus by the antitoxin with almost mechanical accuracy. In\r\nsome parts of the world, the loss of horses by tetanus is so common\r\nthat their immunity is a very important matter; and that the antitoxin\r\ndoes confer immunity on them is shown by statistics from France and\r\nfrom the United States:--\r\n\r\n   1. _France._--\"The results of Nocard's method of preventive\r\n   inoculations in veterinary practice are most striking. Among 63\r\n   veterinarians, there have been inoculated 2737 animals with\r\n   preventive doses of antitoxin, and not a single case of tetanus\r\n   developed; while during the same period, in the same\r\n   neighbourhoods, 259 cases of tetanus developed in non-inoculated\r\n   animals.\" (_Med. News_, 7th July 1900.)\r\n\r\n   2. _United States._--\"Joseph MacFarland and E. M. Ranck, in\r\n   addition to a synopsis of the method of manufacture of\r\n   tetanus-antitoxin, give some facts of interest and importance in\r\n   regard to its use for prophylaxis and treatment. The studies\r\n   were made upon several hundred horses used for the production\r\n   of various immunised serums in one of the large laboratories of\r\n   the United States. The horses, because of the constant\r\n   manipulations, frequently became infected with tetanus, and in\r\n   1897 and 1898, when scrupulous cleanliness and disinfection were\r\n   the only precautions employed to prevent the disease, the\r\n   death-rate varied from 8 to 10 per cent. During 1899 nearly two\r\n   hundred horses were subjected to systematic immunisation with\r\n   tetanus-antitoxin; and, in spite of otherwise similar\r\n   conditions, the death-rate descended to 1 per cent.\" (_Medical\r\n   Annual_, 1901.)\r\n\r\nThe preventive use of the antitoxin has, of course, a very limited\r\nrange outside veterinary surgery. Tetanus, thanks to the use of\r\nantiseptic or aseptic methods, not only in hospital surgery but also\r\nin amateur and domestic surgery, has become a very rare disease,\r\nexcept in tropical countries. It is no longer a \"hospital disease\";\r\nand, even in war, it no longer has anything like the frequency that it\r\nhad, for instance, in the War of the Rebellion. A student may now go\r\nall his time at a large hospital without seeing more than a very few\r\ncases. But, now and again, attention is called to some wholly\r\nunsuspected risk of the disease. For example, certain cases of tetanus\r\noccurred in Dundee among workers at the jute-mills there:--\r\n\r\n   \"The last victim was a female worker in the jute-mill, who, six\r\n   days after a crushed and lacerated wound of the foot, developed\r\n   tetanus and died within twenty-four hours. Some of the dust,\r\n   taken from under the machine in which the foot was crushed, was\r\n   found to contain an unusually large number of tetanus-bacilli.\r\n   The source of the jute used is India.\" (_Medical News_, August\r\n   1900.)\r\n\r\nAgain, at the Gebaer Anstalt at Prague, in 1899, an outbreak of\r\ntetanus occurred, with several deaths; but it was stopped when a\r\npreventive dose of the antitoxin was given to the new patients on\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nAgain, an amazing number of deaths from tetanus, in the United States,\r\nare due to wounds of the hands with toy-pistols. It is said that after\r\nthe Fourth of July festivities in 1899, no less than 83 cases of\r\ntetanus were reported, 26 of them in and around New York. Almost all\r\nof them were due to gunshot wounds of the hand with toy-pistols: the\r\nunclean wad of the cartridge, made of refuse paper picked up in the\r\nstreets, penetrates deep into the tissues of the hand, taking the\r\ngerms of the disease with it, out of the reach of surgical\r\ndisinfection. These cases of tetanus in the United States from\r\ntoy-pistol wounds are so frequent, that immunisation has been\r\nrecommended for them. The _Medical News_, 1st June 1901, has the\r\nfollowing note:--\"H. G. Wells states that tetanus is endemic in\r\nChicago, the specific organism being present in the dirt of the\r\nstreets. Every Fourth of July an epidemic occurs, because these\r\nbacilli are carried deeply into wounds before wads from blank\r\ncartridges.... The writer thinks that such cases should receive a\r\nprophylactic dose, say, 5 c.c. of tetanus-antitoxin, as soon as\r\npossible after the wound is first seen. It seems certain that if\r\nantitoxin prophylaxis were adopted, there would be no further Fourth\r\nof July epidemics, and this end would justify the means.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, a man might receive a lacerated wound under conditions\r\nespecially favourable to infection: he might tear his hand in a stable\r\nwhere horses had died of tetanus, or he might cut his finger while he\r\nwas working at the disease in a pathological laboratory, or he might\r\nreceive a poisoned arrow-wound out in Africa. In any such emergency,\r\nhe could safeguard his life with a protective dose of antitoxin.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be added, that the modern study of tetanus has brought\r\ninto more general use the old rule that the wounded tissues in a\r\nsevere case of tetanus should be at once excised. Before Nicolaier's\r\nwork, while the theory still survived that the disease was due to\r\nascending inflammation of a nerve, this rule was neither enforced nor\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe results published during the last few years (_Medical Annual_,\r\n1905-1906) seem to show that the antitoxin has neither gained nor lost\r\nground as a remedy. It is, of course, used in conjunction with all\r\nother remedies. Perhaps, in a few years more, something better will be\r\ndiscovered. And that discovery, when it comes, will be, as it were,\r\nNicolaier's gift. The whole study of the disease goes back straight to\r\nthe rabbits inoculated in 1880-1884: neither is it possible that the\r\ndisease should be further studied, without the help of bacteriology.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nRABIES\r\n\r\nPasteur's study of rabies began in 1880; and the date of the first\r\ncase treated--Joseph Meister, a shepherd-boy of Alsace--is July 1885.\r\nThe first part of the work was spent in a prolonged search for the\r\nspecific microbe of rabies. It was not found: its existence is a\r\nmatter of inference, but not of observation.[24] In his earlier\r\ninoculations, Pasteur made use of the saliva of rabid animals; and M.\r\nValléry-Radot tells the story, how Pasteur took him on one of his\r\nexpeditions:--\r\n\r\n   \"The rabid beast was in this case a huge bull-dog, foaming at\r\n   the mouth and howling in his cage. All attempts to induce the\r\n   animal to bite, and so infect one of the rabbits, failed. 'But\r\n   we _must_,' said Pasteur, 'inoculate the rabbits with the\r\n   saliva.' Accordingly a noose was made and thrown, the dog\r\n   secured and dragged to the edge of the cage, and his jaws tied\r\n   together. Choking with rage, the eyes bloodshot, and the body\r\n   convulsed by a violent spasm, the animal was stretched on a\r\n   table, and kept motionless, while Pasteur, leaning over his\r\n   foaming head, sucked up into a narrow glass tube some drops of\r\n   the saliva.\"\r\n\r\n  [24] This sentence was written before the publication of Professor\r\n  Negri's observations (see _Medical Annual_, 1906, p. 418).\r\n\r\nBut these inoculations of saliva sometimes failed to produce the\r\ndisease; and, when they succeeded, the incubation-period was wholly\r\nuncertain: it might be some months before the disease appeared. Thus\r\nPasteur was led to use, instead of the saliva, an emulsion of the\r\nbrain or spinal cord; because, as Dr. Duboué had suggested, the\r\ncentral nervous system is the chief seat, the _locus electionis_, of\r\nthe virus of rabies. But these inoculations also were not always\r\nsuccessful, nor did they give a definite incubation-period.\r\n\r\nTherefore he followed with rabies the method that he had followed with\r\nanthrax. As he had cultivated the virus of anthrax, by putting it\r\nwhere its development could be watched and controlled, so he must put\r\nthe virus of rabies in the place of its choice. It has a selective\r\naction on the cells of the central nervous system, a sort of affinity\r\nwith them; they are, as it were, the natural home of rabies, the\r\nproper nutrient medium for the virus: therefore the virus must be\r\ninoculated not under the skin, but under the skull.\r\n\r\nThese sub-dural inoculations were the turning-point of Pasteur's\r\ndiscovery. The first inoculation was made by M. Roux:--\r\n\r\n   \"Next day, when I informed Pasteur that the intracranial\r\n   inoculation offered no difficulty, he was moved with pity for\r\n   the dog. 'Poor beast, his brain is doubtless injured: he must be\r\n   paralysed.' Without reply I went down to the basement to fetch\r\n   it, and let it come into the laboratory. Pasteur did not like\r\n   dogs, but when he saw this one, full of life, inquisitively\r\n   rummaging about in all directions, he exhibited the greatest\r\n   delight, and lavished most charming words upon it.\"\r\n\r\nHenceforth all uncertainty was at an end, and the way was clear ahead:\r\nPasteur had now to deal with a virus that had a definite period of\r\nincubation, and a suitable medium for development. The central nervous\r\nsystem was to the virus of rabies what the test-tube was to the virus\r\nof fowl-cholera or anthrax. As he had controlled these diseases, had\r\nturned them this way and that, attenuated and intensified them, so he\r\ncould control rabies. By transmitting it through a series of rabbits,\r\nby sub-dural inoculation of each rabbit with a minute quantity of\r\nnerve-tissue from the rabbit that had died before it, he was able to\r\nintensify the virus, to shorten its period of incubation, to fix it at\r\nsix days. Thus he obtained a virus of exact strength, a definite\r\nstandard of virulence, _virus fixe_: the next rabbit inoculated would\r\nhave the disease in six days, neither more nor less.\r\n\r\nAs he was able to intensify the virus by transmission, so he was able\r\nto attenuate it by gradual drying of the tissues that contained it.\r\nThe spinal cord, taken from a rabbit that has died of rabies, slowly\r\nloses virulence by simple drying. A cord dried for four days is less\r\nvirulent than one that has been dried for three, and more virulent\r\nthan one dried for five. A cord dried for a fortnight has lost all\r\nvirulence: even a large dose of it will not produce the disease. By\r\nthis method of drying, Pasteur was enabled to obtain the virus in all\r\ndegrees of activity: he could always keep going one or more series of\r\ncords, of known and exactly graduated strengths, according to the\r\nlength of time they had been dried--ranging from absolute\r\nnon-virulence through every shade of virulence.\r\n\r\nAnd, as with fowl-cholera and anthrax, so with rabies; a virus which\r\nhas been attenuated till it has been rendered innocuous, can yet\r\nconfer immunity against its more virulent forms: just as vaccination\r\ncan protect against smallpox. A man, bitten by a rabid animal, has at\r\nleast some weeks of respite before the disease can break out; and,\r\nduring that time of respite, he can be immunised against the disease,\r\nwhile it is still dormant: he begins with a dose of virus attenuated\r\npast all power of doing harm, and advances day by day to more active\r\ndoses, guarded each day by the dose of the day before, till he has\r\nmanufactured within himself enough antitoxin to make him proof against\r\nany outbreak of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe cords used for treatment are removed from the bodies of the\r\nrabbits, by an aseptic method, and are cut into lengths and hung in\r\nglass jars, with some chloride of calcium in them, for drying. The\r\njars are dated, and then kept in glass cases in a dark room at a\r\nconstant temperature. To make sure that the cords are aseptic, a small\r\nportion of each cord is sown on nutrient jelly in a test-tube, and\r\nwatched, to see that no bacteria occur in the tube. For each\r\ninjection, a certain small quantity of cord is rubbed-up in sterilised\r\nfluid; and these subcutaneous injections give no pain or malaise worth\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nOf course, the treatment is adjusted to the gravity of the case. A\r\nbite through naked skin is more grave than a bite through clothing;\r\nand bites on the head or face, and wolf-bites, are worst of all. The\r\nnumber and character of the scars are also taken into account. An\r\nexcellent description of the treatment, by a patient, was published in\r\nthe _Birmingham Medical Review_ of January 1898. It gives the\r\nfollowing tables of treatment:--\r\n\r\n1. _Ordinary Treatment._\r\n\r\n      Day of            Days of Drying\r\n    Treatment.             of Cord.\r\n        1                 14 and 13\r\n        2                 12 and 11\r\n        3                 10 and  9\r\n        4                  8 and  7\r\n        5                     6\r\n        6                     6\r\n        7                     5\r\n        8                     4\r\n        9     (1/2 dose)      3\r\n       10    (full dose)      5\r\n       11                     5\r\n       12                     4\r\n       13                     4\r\n       14     (1/2 dose)      3\r\n       15    (full dose)      3\r\n\r\n2. _Cases of Moderate Gravity._\r\n\r\nSame treatment, up to 13th day.\r\n\r\n     Day of            Days of Drying\r\n    Treatment.            of Cord.\r\n       14                     3\r\n       15                     5\r\n       16                     4\r\n       17     (1/2 dose)      3\r\n       18    (full dose)      3\r\n\r\n3. _Grave Cases._\r\n\r\nSame treatment, up to 10th day.\r\n\r\n     Day of            Days of Drying\r\n    Treatment.            of Cord.\r\n       11                     4\r\n       12                     3\r\n       13                     5\r\n       14                     5\r\n       15                     4\r\n       16                     4\r\n       17     (1/2 dose)      3\r\n       18    (full dose)      3\r\n       19                     5\r\n       20                     3\r\n       21                     4\r\n       22                     3\r\n\r\n4. _Very Grave Cases._\r\n\r\nSame treatment as 3, and in addition.\r\n\r\n     Day of            Days of Drying\r\n    Treatment.            of Cord.\r\n       23                     5\r\n       24                     4\r\n       25     (1/2 dose)      3\r\n       26    (full dose)      3\r\n\r\nFurious criticism, unbelief, and flagrant misstatement of facts began\r\nat once, and lasted more than two years. Of Pasteur's opponents, the\r\nchief was M. Peter, who besought the Académie des Sciences, about once\r\na week, that they should close Pasteur's laboratory, because he was\r\nnot preventing hydrophobia but producing it. The value of M. Peter's\r\njudgment may be estimated by what he had said, a few years earlier,\r\nabout bacteriology in general--\"I do not much believe in that invasion\r\nof parasites which threatens us like an eleventh plague of Egypt.\r\nAfter so many laborious researches, nothing will be changed in\r\nmedicine, there will only be a few more microbes. M. Pasteur's excuse\r\nis that he is a chemist, who has tried, out of a wish to be useful,\r\nto reform medicine, to which he is a complete stranger.\"\r\n\r\nBut it does not matter what was said twenty years ago. In England, the\r\nReport of the 1886 Committee, and the Mansion House meeting in July\r\n1889, mark the decline and fall of all intelligent opposition to the\r\nwork. Among so many thousand cases, during so many years, it would be\r\na miracle indeed if not a single case had failed or gone amiss; but we\r\nare concerned here with the thousands. Take, to begin with, four\r\nreports from Athens, Palermo, Rio, and Paris. It is to be noted that\r\nthe patients, alike at Paris and at other Institutes, are divided into\r\nthree classes:--\r\n\r\n   \"A. Bitten by animals proved to have been rabid by the\r\n   development of rabies in other animals inoculated from them.\r\n\r\n   \"B. Bitten by animals proved to have been rabid by dissection of\r\n   their bodies by veterinary surgeons.\r\n\r\n   \"C. Bitten by animals suspected to have been rabid.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted also, as a fact proved beyond doubt, that the full\r\nbenefit of the treatment is not obtained at once; the highest degree\r\nof immunity is reached about a fortnight after the discontinuance of\r\nthe treatment. Those few cases, therefore, where hydrophobia has\r\noccurred, not only in spite of treatment, but within a fortnight of\r\nthe last day of treatment, are counted as cases where the treatment\r\ncame too late.\r\n\r\nFinally, what was the risk from the bite of a rabid animal, in the\r\ndays before 1885? It is a matter of guess-work. One writer, and one\r\nonly, guessed it at 5 per cent.; another guessed it at 55, and a third\r\ncame to the safe conclusion that it was \"somewhere between these\r\nlimits.\" Leblanc, who is probably the best guide, put it at 16; and\r\nPasteur himself put it between 15 and 20. But suppose it were only 10;\r\nthat, before Pasteur, out of every 100 men bitten by rabid animals, 90\r\nwould escape and only 10 would die of hydrophobia; then take this\r\nfact, that in one year, at one Institute alone, there were 142\r\npatients in class A, bitten by animals that were proved, by the\r\nunanswerable test of inoculation, to have been rabid; and 1 death. And\r\nevery year the same thing; and in all the twelve years together, 2872\r\nsuch cases (A) and 20 deaths--a mortality not of 10 per cent., but of\r\nless than 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n1. _Athens_\r\n\r\nThe _Annales de l'Institut Pasteur_, June 1898, contain Dr. Pampoukis'\r\nreport of three years' work at the Hellenic Institute, from August\r\n1894 to December 1897. During this period 797 cases were treated--590\r\nmale and 207 female. The animals that bit them were--dogs, 732; cats,\r\n34; wolf, 1; other animals, 13; and the 17 other patients had been\r\nexposed to infection from the saliva of hydrophobic patients. Of the\r\n797 cases, 245 were of class A, 112 B, and 440 C.\r\n\r\n\"Among the 797 persons treated, there are 2 deaths, one in class B and\r\nthe other in class C. Thus the mortality has been 0.25 per cent.\r\nBesides these 2 who died of rabies there are 5 more, in whom the first\r\nsigns of rabies showed themselves in less than fifteen days after the\r\nlast inoculation.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, beside these 797 cases, there is 1 other case, bitten by a\r\nwolf, in which the treatment failed. If we reckon this last case in\r\nthe statistics of mortality, we have 3 deaths in 798 cases = 0.37 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\"Beside these 798 cases treated at the Institute, there have been\r\nothers that have not undergone the antirabic treatment, having trusted\r\nthe assurances of those who are called in Greece _empirics_. Among\r\nthese non-treated cases there are 40 who have died of rabies.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Palermo_\r\n\r\nThe _Annales_ for April 1896 give the report by Dr. de Blasi and Dr.\r\nRusso-Travali of the work of the Municipal Institute at Palermo during\r\n8-1/2 years, from March 1887 to December 1895. The number of cases was\r\n2221; in 1240 (class A), the animals were proved to have been rabid by\r\nthe result of inoculations; in 981, there was reason to suspect\r\nrabies.\r\n\r\n\"Setting aside 5 patients who died during the course of the treatment,\r\nand 5 others who died less than fifteen days after the end of the\r\ntreatment, we have had to deplore only 9 failures = 0.4 per cent.

Beside these 2647 there were 1234 who were not treated,\r\nbecause it was ascertained that they were in no danger of rabies; 3\r\nwho were brought to the Institute, already suffering from the disease;\r\nand 59 who refused treatment.\r\n\r\nOf the 2647 persons treated, 10 had pricked their hands at work in the\r\nlaboratory, 3 had exposed chance scratches on their hands to the\r\nsaliva of rabid animals, and 1 had been bitten by a rabid patient. Of\r\nthe rest, 1886 had been bitten on the bare skin, and 747 through\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nIn 236 cases the rabies of the animal had been proved by inoculation.\r\nIn 1173 it had been recognised by the signs of the disease. In 1238\r\nthere was good reason to suspect that the animal had been rabid.\r\n\r\nOf the 2647 patients, in 30 cases the treatment was stopped, because\r\nthe animals were at last traced, after treatment was begun, and were\r\nfound not to be rabid. In 65 cases the patients, after treatment was\r\nbegun, refused to go on with it, and 3 of them died of rabies. In 6\r\ncases rabies developed during treatment; 5 of them had been very badly\r\nbitten about the head, and 1 did not come for treatment till the\r\ntwenty-first day after the bite, and was attacked by rabies two days\r\nlater. And 5 cases died of other maladies that had nothing to do with\r\nrabies. Setting aside these 106 cases, there remain 2541 cases, with\r\n20 deaths = 0.78 per cent. But, of these 20 deaths, 9 occurred within\r\nfifteen days of the end of treatment, before protection was fully\r\nestablished. If these 9 deaths be excluded, the figures stand at 2532\r\ncases, with 11 deaths = 0.43 per cent.\r\n\r\n4. _Paris_\r\n\r\nDr. Pottevin's report on the work of the Pasteur Institute (Paris)\r\nduring 1897 (_Annales_, April 1898) must be given word for word,\r\nwithout abbreviation.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDuring 1897, 1521 patients received the anti-treatment at the Pasteur\r\nInstitute: 8 died of rabies.

The rabies of the animal was proved by experiment, by the\r\ndevelopment of rabies in animals inoculated with its bulb (the upper\r\nend of the spinal cord).[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] It is satisfactory to know that rabbits affected with rabies\r\n  do not suffer in the same way as dogs and some other animals, but\r\n  become subject to a painless kind of paralysis.\r\n\r\nB. The rabies of the animal was proved by veterinary examination\r\n(dissection of its body).\r\n\r\nC.

Camille Bourg, 26. Bitten 11th April; treated at the Pasteur\r\nInstitute, 13th to 30th April; died of rabies at the Lariboisière\r\nHospital, 26th May. Six penetrating bites on the ball of the left\r\nthumb. The dog was examined by M. Grenot, a veterinary surgeon at\r\nParis, and the dissection gave evidence of rabies. Another person\r\nbitten and treated at the same time as Bourg is now in good health.\r\n\r\n2. Louis Fiquet, 23. Bitten 22nd April; treated at the Pasteur\r\nInstitute, 23rd April to 10th May; died of rabies at the Necker\r\nHospital, 4th June. Five bites, two of them deep, round the right\r\nthumb. They had been cauterised five hours after infliction. The dog\r\nwas examined by M. Caussé, a veterinary surgeon at Boulogne, and the\r\ndissection gave evidence of rabies. Another person bitten at the same\r\ntime as Fiquet is now in good health.\r\n\r\n3. Annette Beaufort, 19. Licked on the hands, which were chapped, on\r\n15th April. The dog was killed next day, examined, and declared to\r\nhave been rabid by M. Lachmann, a veterinary surgeon at Saint-Étienne.\r\nTreated at the Pasteur Institute, 20th April to 7th May. Died of\r\nrabies 14th October. Two other persons bitten by the same dog and\r\ntreated at the Pasteur Institute are now in good health.\r\n\r\n4. Julien Heniquet, 53. Bitten 11th March, by a dog that M. Jenvresse,\r\nveterinary surgeon at Beaumont-sur-Oise, declared after dissection to\r\nhave been rabid. One bite had torn the lower lip, the wound had been\r\nsutured; three other wounds on the nose. The wounds had not been\r\ncauterised. Treated at the Pasteur Institute, 18th May to 5th June.\r\nFirst symptoms of rabies showed themselves 4th June, before the\r\ntreatment was finished; died 7th June. As the disease had its onset\r\nduring the course of the inoculations, this case should be excluded\r\nfrom the number of those who died of rabies after treatment.\r\n\r\n5. Germain Segond, 7. Penetrating bite on the bare right fore-arm,\r\n23rd May. Cauterised an hour later with a red-hot iron. Treated 26th\r\nMay to 9th June; died of rabies 22nd July. The dog's bulb had been\r\nsent to the Pasteur Institute. A guinea-pig inoculated in the eye 26th\r\nMay was seized with rabies 10th September.\r\n\r\n6. Suzanne Richard, 8. Bitten 12th June on the left leg by a dog,\r\nfound on dissection to have been rabid by M. Touret, veterinary\r\nsurgeon at Sannois. The bite, penetrating 3 cm. long, had been\r\nsutured; it had been made through a cotton stocking, and had been\r\ncauterised in half-an-hour. Treated 13th to 30th June; died of rabies\r\n2nd August. (Notes from M. le Dr. Margny, at Sannois.)\r\n\r\n7. Joseph Vaudale, 33. Bitten on the left hand, 8th August. Six\r\npenetrating bites on the back of the hand; had not been cauterised.\r\nThe dog was declared rabid by M. Verraert, veterinary surgeon at\r\nOstend. Treated at the Pasteur Institute, 11th to 28th August; died of\r\nrabies 27th September.\r\n\r\n8. Paul Morin, 38. Bitten 24th August on the left cheek, a single\r\nbite, 2 cm. long; no cauterisation. The dog was sent to the Alfort\r\nSchool, 25th August, and found to be rabid. Treated at the Pasteur\r\nInstitute, 26th August to 15th September. Died of rabies some days\r\nafter the end of treatment (three weeks after the bite, says a note\r\nsent to us). The interval between the end of the treatment and the\r\nonset of the disease being less than fourteen days, Morin must not be\r\ncounted in the number of patients inoculated under conditions which\r\npermit successful inoculation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe hardly need follow the work of the remaining years. The figures are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    +-------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n    | Year. | Patients | Deaths. | Mortality |\r\n    |       | treated. |         | per cent. |\r\n    +-------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n    | 1898  |   1465   |    3    |   0.2     |\r\n    | 1899  |   1614   |    4    |   0.25    |\r\n    | 1900  |   1420   |    4    |   0.28    |\r\n    | 1901  |   1318   |    5    |   0.38    |\r\n    | 1902  |   1105   |    2    |   0.18    |\r\n    | 1903  |    628   |    2    |   0.32    |\r\n    | 1904  |    755   |    3    |   0.39    |\r\n    +-------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThe falling off in the number of patients at the Paris Institute is\r\nrelated to the establishment of similar Institutes at Lyon,\r\nMarseilles, Bordeaux, Lille, and Montpellier. But is it not possible\r\nthat a patient, after treatment at the Paris Institute, should die at\r\nhome of rabies, and his death not be notified to the Institute? The\r\nanswer is, that the Institute is very careful, so far as possible, to\r\nkeep in touch with its old patients. For instance, in 1903, it\r\nrecorded the case of a carpenter in a Welsh village, who had died of\r\nrabies nearly two years after treatment. And, of course, an Institute\r\npatient, wherever he was, would be of interest to his neighbours: and\r\na death from rabies would excite attention, and would hardly fail to\r\nbe reported.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that some sort of intensive modification of\r\nPasteur's treatment may be found, not for the prevention, but for the\r\ncure of hydrophobia; and two successful cases of this kind have been\r\nreported in the _Annales_ of the Paris Institute. Apart from this\r\nfaint hope, the _cure_ of hydrophobia is where it was in the days of\r\nthe \"Tonquin medicine\" and the \"Tanjore pills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nCHOLERA\r\n\r\nThe study of cholera was the hardest of all the hard labours of\r\nbacteriology; it took years of work in all parts of the world, and the\r\ndifficulty and disappointments over it are past all telling. Koch's\r\ndiscovery of the comma-bacillus (1883) raised a thousand questions\r\nthat were solved only by infinite patience, international unity for\r\nscience, and incessant research; and the Hamburg epidemic (1892) marks\r\nthe time when the comma-bacillus was at last recognised as the cause\r\nof cholera. A mere list of the men who did the work would fill page\r\nafter page; it was bacteriology _in excelsis_, often dangerous,[26]\r\nand always laborious.\r\n\r\n  [26] \"In order to prove that this _vibrio_ is the cause of Asiatic\r\n  cholera, several tests upon themselves have been voluntarily made\r\n  by investigators in laboratories. These were carried out in Munich\r\n  and in Paris. The results to the experimenters were sufficiently\r\n  severe to indicate positively the pathogenic character of the\r\n  spirillum, and its capacity to produce cholera-like infections.\r\n  Such experimentation is, of course, to be deprecated; indeed, the\r\n  occurrence of accidental laboratory infections, one of which ended\r\n  fatally, furnished the necessary final proof of the specificity of\r\n  the cholera _vibrio_, and rendered unnecessary any exposure to the\r\n  risks belonging to voluntary inoculation.\" (Dr. Flexner, Stedman's\r\n  _Twentieth Century Practice_, vol. xix., 1900.)\r\n\r\nThere is the same heroic note in the story of the preventive treatment\r\nof cholera by Haffkine's method; one of the men in whom Pasteur seems\r\nto live again. He began in 1889, under Pasteur's guidance, to study\r\nthe immunisation of animals against the cholera-bacillus. Other men,\r\nof course, were working on the same lines--Pfeiffer, Brieger,\r\nMetchnikoff, Fischer, Gamaleïa, Klein, Wassermann, and many more--and\r\nby 1892 the immunisation of animals was proved up to the hilt. Then\r\ncame the advance from animals to men, from laboratories to Indian\r\ncities, villages, and cantonments; and here the honour is Haffkine's,\r\nand his alone. Ferran's inoculations (Spain, 1885) had failed.\r\nHaffkine, having tested his method on himself and his friends, went to\r\nIndia, with a commendatory letter from the British Government:--\r\n\r\n   \"Researches on cholera, with special reference to inoculation,\r\n   were undertaken and carried on in my laboratory, in the Pasteur\r\n   Institute in Paris, between 1889 and 1893. The experiments\r\n   resulted in the elaboration of the present method, which when\r\n   tried on animals was found to render them resistant against\r\n   every form of cholera-poisoning otherwise fatal to them.\r\n\r\n   \"The physiological and pathological effect on man was then\r\n   studied on some sixty persons, mostly medical and scientific men\r\n   interested in the solution of the problem. The effect was found\r\n   to be harmless to health. The next step was to transfer the\r\n   operations to the East.\" (Haffkine's _Report to the Government\r\n   of India_, 1895.)\r\n\r\nHe reached Calcutta in March 1893, and at the request of Mr.\r\nHankin[27] was invited to Agra; here, in April, he vaccinated over 900\r\npersons, including many English officers. From Agra to Aligarh; and\r\nfrom Aligarh he was asked to more places than he could visit. In 1895\r\nhis health failed, and no wonder; and he came back to Europe for a\r\nshort time:--\r\n\r\n   \"My actual work in India lasted twenty-nine months, between the\r\n   beginning of April 1893 and the end of July 1895. During this\r\n   period the anti-cholera vaccination has been applied to 294\r\n   British officers, 3206 British soldiers, 6629 native soldiers,\r\n   869 civil Europeans, 125 Eurasians, and 31,056 natives of India.\r\n   The inoculated people belonged to 98 localities in the\r\n   North-West Provinces and Oudh, in the Punjab, in Lower Bengal\r\n   and Behar, in the Brahmaputra Valley, and in Lower Assam. No\r\n   official pressure has been brought on the population, and only\r\n   those have been vaccinated who could be induced to do so by free\r\n   persuasion. In every locality, efforts were made to apply the\r\n   operation on parts of large bodies of people living together\r\n   under identical conditions, in order to compare their resistance\r\n   in outbreaks of cholera with that of non-inoculated people\r\n   belonging to the same unit of population. This object has been\r\n   obtained in 64 British and native regiments, in 9 gaols, in 45\r\n   tea-estates, in the fixed agricultural population of the\r\n   villages parallel to Hardwâr pilgrim road, in the _bustees_ of\r\n   Calcutta, in a certain number of boarding-schools, where the\r\n   parents agreed to the inoculation of their children, in\r\n   orphanages, etc. The vast majority of inoculated people lived\r\n   thus under direct observation of the sanitary and medical\r\n   authorities of India.\" (Haffkine, Lecture in London. _British\r\n   Medical Journal_, 21st Dec. 1895.)\r\n\r\n  [27] Mr. Hankin, whose name is had in remembrance by Cambridge\r\n  men, is Chemical Examiner and Bacteriologist to the North-West\r\n  Provinces and Oudh, and to the Central Provinces.\r\n\r\nAltogether, upwards of 70,000 injections on 42,179 people--_without\r\nhaving to record a single instance of mishap or accident of any\r\ndescription produced by our vaccines_. Consider the colossal\r\ndifficulties of this new treatment: the frequent running short of the\r\nvaccine, preventing a second injection; the absolute necessity, at\r\nfirst, of using very small doses of a weak vaccine, lest one disaster\r\nshould occur; the impossibility of avoiding, now and again, some loss\r\nof strength in the vaccine; the impossibility of knowing how long the\r\nprotection would last. Surely in all science there is nothing to beat\r\nthis first voyage of adventure single-handed to fight the cholera in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nLater than Haffkine's 1895 report, we have Dr. Simpson's 1896 report:\r\n\"_Two Years of Anti-choleraic Inoculations in Calcutta._ W. J.\r\nSimpson, M.D., M.R.C.P., D.P.H., Health Officer, Calcutta.\" The date\r\nof this report is 8th July 1896; and it gives not only the Calcutta\r\nresults, but all that are of any use for exact judgment:[28]--\r\n\r\n   \"The results of Calcutta are fully confirmed by those obtained\r\n   in other parts of India, wherever it was possible to make all\r\n   the necessary observations with precision, and wherever the\r\n   cases were sufficiently numerous to show the effect of the\r\n   inoculation.\r\n\r\n   \"Outside Calcutta, since the commencement of the inoculations in\r\n   India in April 1893, opportunities for an exact comparison of\r\n   the respective powers of resistance against cholera of\r\n   inoculated and non-inoculated persons presented themselves; (1)\r\n   in Lucknow, in the East Lancashire Regiment; (2) in Gaya, in the\r\n   jail; (3) in Cachar, among the tea-garden coolies; (4) in\r\n   Margherita, among coolies of the Assam-Burmah Railway Survey;\r\n   (5) in Durbhanga, in the jail; (6) in the coolie camp at\r\n   Bilaspur; (7) in Serampur, among the general population.\"\r\n\r\n  [28] For a summary of this report, see the _Lancet_, 8th August\r\n  1896. For more recent results, see Surgeon-Captain Vaughan and\r\n  Assistant-Surgeon Mukerji, in the thirtieth annual report of the\r\n  Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal (1897). Also the note published\r\n  by Surgeon-Captain Nott, in the _Indian Medical Gazette_, May\r\n  1898.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in this 1896 report, are all the results that give an\r\nanswer to the question, What will happen when cholera breaks out\r\namong a number of people living under the same conditions, of whom\r\nsome have received preventive treatment, and the rest have been left\r\nto Nature?\r\n\r\nI. _Calcutta_ (1894-1896)\r\n\r\n   \"The number of people inoculated during the period under review\r\n   was 7690; of these, 5853 are Hindus, 1476 Mahomedans, and 361\r\n   other classes.... Considering that the system is a new one, that\r\n   the inoculations are purely voluntary, and everything connected\r\n   with them has to be explained before the confidence of the\r\n   people can be obtained, and considering how long new ideas are\r\n   in taking root among the general population--and in this case it\r\n   is not merely the acceptance of an idea, but such faith in it as\r\n   to consent to submit to an operation--the number is certainly\r\n   satisfactory for a beginning. The present problem can be\r\n   compared with the introduction of vaccination against smallpox\r\n   into Calcutta. It took 25 years before the number of\r\n   vaccinations reached an average of 2000; whereas the\r\n   inoculations against cholera have in two years nearly doubled\r\n   that average. This is a proof that, in spite of the difficulties\r\n   which every new movement naturally has to meet with, there are\r\n   large numbers of people anxious to avail themselves of the\r\n   protective effect of the inoculations.\r\n\r\n   \"Although all sorts and conditions of individuals, weak and\r\n   strong, sickly and healthy, young and old, well nourished and\r\n   badly nourished, and often persons suffering from chronic\r\n   diseases, have been inoculated, in every instance, without\r\n   exception, the inoculations have proved perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n   \"The investigations on the effect of the inoculation are made\r\n   exclusively in those houses in which cholera has actually\r\n   occurred, the object being to ascertain and compare the\r\n   incidence of cholera on the inoculated and not inoculated in\r\n   those houses in which inoculations had been previously carried\r\n   out. _For this purpose, affected houses in which inoculations\r\n   have not been performed, and inoculated houses in which cholera\r\n   has not appeared, are excluded._\"\r\n\r\nNature gave a demonstration in 77 houses. In one house, and one only,\r\nall the household had been inoculated; in 76, inoculated and\r\nnon-inoculated were living together; but of these 76 houses, 6 are\r\nexcluded from the table of results, because the inoculated in them\r\nwere so few--less than one-tenth of the household--that their escape\r\nfrom cholera might be called chance. The cholera came, and left behind\r\nit this fact:--\r\n\r\n   654 uninoculated individuals had 71 deaths = 10.86 per cent.\r\n\r\n   402 inoculated in the same households had 12 deaths = 2.99 per\r\n   cent.\r\n\r\nIf we add the 6 houses which Dr. Simpson excludes, we find that in 77\r\nhouses there were 89 deaths from cholera, 77 being among the\r\nuninoculated and 12 among the inoculated.\r\n\r\nMoreover, of these 12 deaths, 5 occurred during the first five days\r\nafter inoculation--that is to say, during the period in which the\r\nprotective influence of the vaccine was still incomplete. _Then came a\r\nperiod of more than a year, during which the uninoculated had 42\r\ndeaths, and the inoculated had one death._ The remaining 6 of the 12\r\ndeaths occurred more than a year after inoculation, and 5 of these 6\r\nhad received only one inoculation of the weak vaccine that was used\r\nearly in 1894.\r\n\r\nTake a good instance that came at the very beginning of the work:--\r\n\r\n   \"A local epidemic took place around two tanks in Kattal Began\r\n   _bustee_, ward 19, occupied by about 200 people. In this _bustee_,\r\n   about the end of March, 2 fatal cases of cholera and 2 cases of\r\n   choleraic diarrhoea occurred. The outbreak led to the inoculation\r\n   of 116 persons in the _bustee_ out of the 200. Since then, 9 cases\r\n   of cholera, of which 7 were fatal, and 1 case of choleraic\r\n   diarrhoea have appeared in the _bustee_, and it is a very\r\n   extraordinary fact that all these 10 cases of cholera have occurred\r\n   exclusively among the uninoculated portion of the inhabitants,\r\n   which, as stated, forms the minority in the _bustee_; while none of\r\n   the inoculated have been affected.\" (_Cholera in Calcutta in 1894._\r\n   W. J. Simpson.)\r\n\r\n2. _Lucknow_ (1893)\r\n\r\nThe story of the outbreak of cholera in the East Lancashire Regiment\r\nmust be read carefully:--\r\n\r\n   \"Rumour magnified the events connected with this outbreak, and\r\n   distorted the facts connected with the inoculations; and as a\r\n   result, the current of public opinion, which had previously been\r\n   in favour of inoculation, set in strongly in the opposite\r\n   direction. The advocates of anti-choleraic inoculations were\r\n   abused in no particularly measured terms, and the inoculations\r\n   were held up to be the source of every possible evil and danger\r\n   ... of the most loathsome diseases, and of every ill which man\r\n   is heir to. The distrust engendered by these misrepresentations\r\n   and fulminations was, however, only of a temporary nature; and\r\n   when the exact circumstances came to be known and understood,\r\n   the confidence created by the Calcutta experience began to be\r\n   considerably restored. Inoculations were performed in May 1893,\r\n   in the East Lancashire, Royal Irish, 16th Lancers, 7th Bengal\r\n   Infantry, 7th Bengal Cavalry, and general populations in the\r\n   Civil Lines. In 1894, cholera appeared among the native\r\n   population of Lucknow, in the form of an epidemic distinguished\r\n   by its extreme virulence, patients succumbing in the course of\r\n   a few hours. It is stated that the epidemic was of a most\r\n   malignant type. In the latter part of July it entered the\r\n   cantonments, and attacked the East Lancashire, almost\r\n   exclusively confining its ravages to that regiment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the East Lancashire, 185 men were inoculated in May 1893. From the\r\nstatistical returns obtained from the military authorities at Lucknow,\r\nit appears that at the time of the outbreak, in July 1894, the\r\nstrength of the men, including those in hospital, was 773; and of\r\nthese, 133 had been inoculated, as recorded in the inoculation\r\nregister, and 640 had not been inoculated.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the total number of attacks and deaths in\r\nnot inoculated and inoculated:--\r\n\r\n    +---------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n    |                     |   Attacks.  |  Deaths.   |\r\n    +---------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n    |                     | Per cent.   | Per cent.  |\r\n    | Non-inoculated, 640 | 120 = 18.75 | 79 = 12.34 |\r\n    | Inoculated, 133     |  18 = 13.53 | 13 = 9.7   |\r\n    +---------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe men were moved into camp; but this movement seemed only to make\r\nthings worse: \"the epidemic in the camp appears to have been twice as\r\nsevere as in the cantonment.\"[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] \"The moving into camp, notwithstanding this example, is all\r\n  the same an excellent measure of defence, and would with reason be\r\n  adopted in every outbreak.\" (Simpson, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\nLucknow came so early in the work of inoculation, that weak vaccines\r\nwere used in small doses. The cholera, when it broke out, was \"of a\r\nmost malignant type, senior medical officers of long experience in the\r\ncountry stating that such a virulent cholera had not been seen by them\r\nfor very many years past.\" More than a year had elapsed between the\r\ninoculations and the outbreak of the cholera. It is no wonder that the\r\nregiment was not well protected:--\r\n\r\n   \"The small amount of protection which the inoculations afforded\r\n   in this case may have depended on the mild effects which the\r\n   injections produced on the men at the time of the operation in\r\n   1893, in comparison with the severity of the epidemic which\r\n   attacked the regiment. It is recorded in the Lucknow Inoculation\r\n   Registers that only in two men, out of the 185 inoculated in\r\n   1893, a marked febrile reaction was obtained; in 77 individuals\r\n   the vaccinal fever was only slight, while in 66 there was no\r\n   reaction: an effect which was due to the weakness of the\r\n   vaccines procurable at that period of work, and to the small\r\n   doses used. The influence of the vaccines was possibly further\r\n   reduced, at the time of the epidemic, by a lapse of fourteen to\r\n   fifteen months.\" (Haffkine, 1895 Report.)\r\n\r\n3. _Gaya Jail_\r\n\r\nOn 9th July 1894, an outbreak of cholera occurred in the Gaya jail,\r\nand by 18th June there had been 6 cases and 5 deaths. On that day and\r\nthe next day, 215 prisoners were inoculated. The average number of the\r\nprisoners during the outbreak was 207 inoculated, and 202 not\r\ninoculated. Surgeon-Major Macrae, superintendent of the jail,\r\nreports:--\r\n\r\n   \"The inoculations being purely voluntary, no selection of\r\n   prisoners was possible, but all classes of the jail were\r\n   represented--male and female, old and young, habituals and less\r\n   frequent offenders, strong and weakly, convalescent and even\r\n   hospital patients sent their representatives; no difference of\r\n   any kind was made between inoculated and non-inoculated; they\r\n   were under absolutely identical conditions as regards food,\r\n   water, accommodation, etc., in fact in every possible respect.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the best results could hardly be obtained, because the\r\ncholera was already at work: it took about ten days for the 1894\r\nvaccine to produce its full effect; and two inoculations were\r\ngenerally made, one five days after the other. This gradual action of\r\nthe vaccine is well shown in Dr. Simpson's table:--\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n    |                         | NON-INOCULATED,  |   INOCULATED,    |\r\n    |                         |        202.      |       207.       |\r\n    +-------------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n    |                         | Cases. | Deaths. | Cases. | Deaths. |\r\n    +-------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n    | During 5 days after 1st |   7    |    5    |   5    |    4    |\r\n    |     inoculation         |        |         |        |         |\r\n    | During 3 days after 2nd |   5    |    3    |   3    |    1    |\r\n    |     inoculation         |        |         |        |         |\r\n    | After 3 days after 2nd  |   8    |    2    |   0    |    0    |\r\n    |     inoculation         |        |         |        |         |\r\n    +-------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nHaffkine's comment on these figures must be noted here:--\r\n\r\n   \"In the Gaya jail, the inoculations were _for the first time_\r\n   applied _in a prevalent epidemic_, and _very weak doses_ of a\r\n   relatively weak vaccine were used.... Far higher results have\r\n   been obtained by an application of stronger doses. In the\r\n   _bustees_ situated round the tanks in Calcutta, where cholera\r\n   exists in a permanent state, the disease occurred in 36 houses\r\n   with inoculated people. In each of these houses there was one\r\n   part of the family inoculated and another not. The observations\r\n   were continued for 459 days, with the following results:--\r\n\r\nDuring the first period of 5 days, subsequent to the inoculation with\r\nfirst vaccine, cholera occurred in 8 houses.\r\n\r\n   75 non-inoculated had 5 cases, with 3 deaths. 52 inoculated had\r\n   3 cases, with 3 deaths.\r\n\r\nDuring the second period of 5 days, subsequent to the second\r\ninoculation, cholera occurred in 2 houses.\r\n\r\n   8 non-inoculated had 2 cases, with 2 deaths. 17 inoculated had\r\n   no cases.\r\n\r\n_After the 10 days necessary for the preventive treatment had expired,\r\nand up to the 459th day, the disease visited 26 houses._\r\n\r\n   _263 non-inoculated had 38 cases, with 34 deaths._\r\n\r\n   _137 inoculated had 1 case, with 1 death, in a child that had\r\n   not been brought up for the second inoculation.\"_\r\n\r\n4. _Assam-Burmah Railway_\r\n\r\nFor a good instance of lives saved even during an outbreak, take the\r\nAssam-Burmah Railway coolies:--\r\n\r\n   _\"Three hundred and fifty[30] Khassia Hill coolies had been\r\n   collected for the survey party of the Assam-Burmah Railway, and\r\n   put under the escort of a detachment of Goorkhas, when cholera\r\n   broke out amongst them. The largest part of the coolies\r\n   immediately submitted to the preventive inoculation, the rest\r\n   remained uninoculated. The result was that _among the\r\n   not-inoculated minority there were 34 cases, with 30 deaths;\r\n   whereas the inoculated had 4 fatal cases_.\" (Haffkine, 1895,\r\n   Lecture in London.)_\r\n\r\n  [30] The exact number is 355, of whom 196 were inoculated; the\r\n  coolies numbered 343, and the Goorkhas 12. (See Dr. Simpson's 1896\r\n  Report.)\r\n\r\n5. _Durbhanga Jail_ (1896)\r\n\r\nThe figures in this instance are small: but Surgeon-Captain E. Harold\r\nBrown's report is very pleasant reading. Cholera broke out in the\r\njail on 31st March 1896, and by 9th April there had been 8 cases. Next\r\nday, 172 prisoners were moved into camp 12 miles away; and 53 were\r\nleft behind, the sick in the jail hospital, the patients in the\r\ncholera huts, with their attendants, the old and infirm, and a few\r\ncooks and sweepers. That day, 3 cases occurred in the camp, and 1 in\r\nthe jail; and on the 11th, at 2 and 4 A.M., 2 more cases were reported\r\nin camp. At 7.30 A.M., Haffkine and Dr. Green came to the camp:--\r\n\r\n   \"The prisoners were spoken to on the subject, and seemed to be\r\n   pleased with the idea, the word _tika_ (inoculation), which was\r\n   familiar to them from its association with smallpox, appearing\r\n   to appeal to them. They were accordingly arranged in four rows\r\n   facing the tent, in front of which Dr. Haffkine was about to\r\n   commence operations. I was the first subject to be inoculated;\r\n   and after me the jailor, assistant jailor, hospital assistant,\r\n   and three warders. The first prisoner in the front rank was next\r\n   brought up and submitted cheerfully; after which, every\r\n   alternate man was taken, so that no selection of cases was made,\r\n   until one-half of the total number were inoculated. Those who\r\n   had not been inoculated were far from pleased at having been\r\n   passed over; and, to our surprise, they rose almost to a man,\r\n   and begged to be inoculated; nor were they satisfied when told\r\n   that the medicine was exhausted.\"\r\n\r\nThe dose administered on this occasion (11th April 1896) was stronger\r\nthan the Gaya jail dose (18th July 1894): it acted in a few hours, and\r\nthe reaction was well marked.\r\n\r\n   \"There were fresh cases of cholera that day at 12 (noon), 6, 7,\r\n   and 7.30 P.M., and at midnight, all in those who had not been\r\n   inoculated, and all terminating fatally, despite the greatest\r\n   care and the most prompt and assiduous treatment. On the 12th\r\n   two further cases occurred, both among the uninoculated, and\r\n   both died; there being thus eight cases in succession, all from\r\n   the men who were not inoculated, and all proving fatal.\"\r\n\r\nThe inoculations were made at 7.30 A.M. Surgeon-Captain Brown had pain\r\nwithin half-an-hour, and fever in three hours, with temperature 104°,\r\n_but this was probably due to the fact that I was not able to rest_.\r\nThe prisoners, of course, went to bed: they all reacted before 4 P.M.,\r\nbut did not have so much trouble over it. The last case was on the\r\n15th. The outbreak was a bad type of cholera; out of 30 cases 24 died,\r\nsome of them in 1-1/2 to 4 hours. \"To summarise the combined results\r\nof the camp and the jail, we find that of a daily average of 99\r\nnon-inoculated there were 11 cases, all fatal = 11.11 per cent.; of\r\n110 inoculated there were 5 cases, with 3 deaths = 2.73 per cent.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Bilaspur and Serampur_\r\n\r\nHere again the figures are small, but worth noting. In a coolie camp\r\nat Bilaspur (Central Provinces) 100 non-inoculated had 5 deaths, and\r\n150 inoculated had 1 death. In Serampur, among the general population,\r\n51 non-inoculated had 5 cases and 3 deaths, and 42 inoculated had 2\r\ncases and 1 death.\r\n\r\n7. _The Cachar Tea-Gardens_ (1895)\r\n\r\nThis series of inoculations was begun in February 1895, for the\r\nprotection of the coolies on various tea-estates. The results are\r\nexcellent, and deal with large numbers.[31] The latest report from\r\nDr. Arthur Powell, the Medical Officer, is quoted in Dr. Simpson's\r\n1896 report:--\r\n\r\n    _At Kalain_--\r\n      1079 not inoculated had 50 cases, with 30 deaths.\r\n      1250 inoculated--3 cases, with 2 deaths.[32]\r\n\r\n    _At Kalaincherra_--\r\n      685 not inoculated had 10 cases, with 7 deaths.\r\n      155 inoculated--no cases.\r\n\r\n    _At Degubber_--\r\n      254 not inoculated had 12 cases, with 10 deaths.\r\n      407 inoculated--5 cases, all recovered.\r\n\r\n    _At Duna_--\r\n      121 not inoculated had 4 cases, with 2 deaths.\r\n      29 inoculated--no cases.\r\n\r\n    _At Sandura_--\r\n      454 not inoculated had 2 cases, with 1 death.\r\n      51 inoculated--2 cases, with 1 death.\r\n\r\n    _At Karkuri_--\r\n      198 not inoculated had 15 cases, with 9 deaths.\r\n      443 inoculated--3 cases, with 1 death.\r\n\r\n    _At Craig Park_--\r\n      185 not inoculated had 1 fatal case.\r\n      46 inoculated--no cases.\r\n\r\n   TOTAL.\r\n\r\n   Not inoculated, 2976, with 94 cases and 60 deaths. Inoculated,\r\n   2381, with 13 cases and 4 deaths.\r\n\r\n  [31] \"As a field for testing the value of inoculation, the\r\n  tea-factories of India possess many advantages. The labourers\r\n  being under contract, the after-history of those inoculated is\r\n  easily followed up. Each morning the adults are paraded for\r\n  roll-call; and all sick must attend hospital, where a record is\r\n  made of their disease and treatment.\" (Dr. Powell, _Lancet_, 13th\r\n  July 1896.)\r\n\r\n  [32] \"It is unfortunate that neither of the fatal cases among the\r\n  inoculated was seen by any medical man, not even an unqualified\r\n  doctor Babu.\" Dr. Powell does not think, from what was told him,\r\n  that one of them was cholera.\r\n\r\nTo the preceding instances, which are rather old now, must be added\r\nthe following more recent report, from the _Indian Medical Gazette_,\r\nSeptember 1901:--\r\n\r\n   \"We are glad to see, from a paragraph in the Report of the\r\n   Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal (Major H. J. Dyson, I.M.S.,\r\n   F.R.C.S.), that an increased number of anti-cholera inoculations\r\n   were performed during the year 1900. Assistant-Surgeon G. C.\r\n   Mukerjee, who was in charge of this work, reports that in the\r\n   Puralia Coolie Depot no less than 13,291 persons were inoculated\r\n   against cholera, including over 1000 children. All these cases\r\n   of inoculation were among labour emigrants proceeding to the\r\n   tea-gardens of Assam and Cachar. The employers of labour are\r\n   beginning to realise the value of cholera inoculation. It is\r\n   unfortunately not always easy, or even possible, to follow up\r\n   the after-history of persons inoculated; but Major Dyson has\r\n   quoted a table, received from the Superintendent of Emigration,\r\n   which shows the number of cases among the inoculated and the\r\n   non-inoculated at Goalundo. From this table, it is seen that out\r\n   of 1527 non-inoculated coolies, who passed through Goalundo, 33,\r\n   or 2.09 per cent., got cholera; whereas of 873 inoculated\r\n   coolies, only 2, or 0.2 per cent., were attacked by the disease;\r\n   that is, the unprotected suffered about ten times as much as the\r\n   inoculated. Assistant-Surgeon Mukerjee also reports that during\r\n   his cold-weather tour he passed through some villages in the\r\n   Manbhum district, in which he had practised inoculation the\r\n   previous year: and, though there had been epidemics of cholera\r\n   in them, the inoculated persons escaped. They came to him in\r\n   numbers, stating that they owed their safety to the\r\n   inoculation.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the preventive treatment touches points only here and there\r\non the map of India, with its 300,000,000 people. Probably it will\r\nnever become so general in India as vaccination. Cholera in India\r\nrecalls what Ambroise Paré, more than 400 years ago, wrote of the\r\nplague, \"Here in Paris it is always with us.\" But, wherever preventive\r\ninoculation has been done, there it has done good.\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Annual_ for 1905 contains an account of some preventive\r\ninoculations recently made during an epidemic in Japan. Among the\r\ninoculated, the attack-rate was much lower than among the\r\nuninoculated; and the mortality was 45.5 per cent., as against 75 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nAnother most important result of the discovery of the cholera bacillus\r\nis its use in diagnosis. For example, if a case of suspected cholera\r\nis landed at a British port, the sanitary authority at once takes\r\nsteps to ascertain whether the specific microbe is present; and,\r\naccording to the answer given by bacteriology, either allows the\r\npatient to proceed on his journey, or adopts measures of isolation to\r\nprevent the spread of the disease to others. Thus, thanks to the\r\ninsular position of Great Britain, this dreadful disease has for many\r\nyears been prevented from invading her population.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPLAGUE\r\n\r\nThe _bacillus pestis_ was discovered by Kitasato and Yersin, working\r\nindependently, in 1894. Yersin's discovery was made at Hong Kong,\r\nwhither the French Government had sent him to study plague: an\r\nexcellent account of his work is given in the _Annales de l'Institut\r\nPasteur_, September 1894. The first experiments in preventive\r\ninoculation, in animals, were made by Yersin, Calmette, and Borrel,\r\nworking conjointly, in 1895. They found that it was possible to confer\r\non animals a certain degree of immunity, by the hypodermic injection\r\nof dead cultures of the bacillus. These experiments were made on\r\nrabbits and guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\nHaffkine's fluid was first used on man in January 1897. It is a\r\n_bouillon_ containing no living bacilli, and nothing offensive to the\r\nreligious beliefs of India.[33] He proved its efficacy on rabbits; and\r\nthen, on 10th January 1897, inoculated himself with a large dose, four\r\ntimes as strong as the subsequent standard dose. A few days later,\r\nLieut.-Col. Hatch, Principal of the Grant Medical College, Bombay, and\r\nother members of the College Staff, were inoculated. These first\r\ninoculations were described by Haffkine in a lecture (1901) at\r\nPoona:--\r\n\r\n   \"In a short time, a number of the most authoritative physicians\r\n   in Bombay, European and native, official medical officers and\r\n   private practitioners, submitted themselves for inoculation. It\r\n   is a matter of gratification to me to be able to quote, among\r\n   these authorities, the Head of the Medical Service of the\r\n   Presidency, Surgeon-General Bainbridge, who not only got himself\r\n   inoculated, but inoculated also the members of his family.\r\n   Previous to that, Surgeon-General Harvey, the able\r\n   Director-General of the Indian Medical Service, submitted\r\n   himself to inoculation in 1893 against cholera; and, in 1898,\r\n   against plague. It was the example of these gentlemen, whose\r\n   competence in the matter of health could not be disputed, that\r\n   encouraged thousands of people, rich and poor, in Bombay and\r\n   elsewhere, to come forward for inoculation. Thus his Excellency\r\n   the Viceroy thought it right to tell you here, in Poona, that\r\n   previous to his starting for the plague-stricken districts he\r\n   and his staff had also undergone the prophylactic inoculation.\r\n   In due course, mothers brought their children to be protected by\r\n   the new 'vaccination.'\"\r\n\r\n  [33] It is said that the Jains object to inoculations on the\r\n  grounds of religion; and one or two witnesses before the Plague\r\n  Commission gave evidence to the same effect. But, at Bombay, the\r\n  high-priest of a great religious community addressed a meeting of\r\n  5000 in favour of the new treatment; and the rush of suppliants\r\n  for inoculation at Hubli and Gaday proves that there is no real\r\n  religious difficulty. Doctors have been assaulted, as at Poona, so\r\n  at Oporto; in neither case can we say _Tantum relligio potuit\r\n  suadere malorum_.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months, 8142 persons in or near Bombay were inoculated.\r\nIt was not possible, in Bombay, during the rush of plague-work, to\r\nfollow up every one of these 8142 persons. But there is reason to\r\nbelieve, making some allowance for oversights, that only 18 = 0.2 per\r\ncent. of them, were attacked during the epidemic; that, of these 18,\r\nonly 2 died: and that these 2 died within twenty-four hours of\r\ninoculation, _i.e._, had the plague in them already at the time of\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nAnd, with regard to a small group of the inoculated, there are the\r\nfollowing more definite facts. This group lived outside Bombay, across\r\nthe harbour, in a village called Mora. The population of Mora, at the\r\ntime of the epidemic, was estimated at less than 1000. Out of this\r\nnumber 429 were inoculated; which, if the population be reckoned at\r\n1000 exactly, left 571 uninoculated. Among the 429 inoculated, there\r\nwere 7 cases of plague, with no deaths: among the uninoculated there\r\nwere 26 cases, with 24 deaths.\r\n\r\nJust a week after Haffkine had informed the Indian Government that he\r\nhad tested his fluid on himself, plague broke out in the Byculla House\r\nof Correction, Bombay, on 23rd January 1897. Between the 23rd and the\r\nafternoon of the 30th, there were 14 cases, with 7 deaths. On the\r\nafternoon of the 30th, 152 prisoners were inoculated, and 172 were\r\nleft uninoculated. The outbreak ceased on 7th February. The figures,\r\nas corrected by the Plague Commission, are, among the inoculated, 1\r\ncase, which recovered; among the uninoculated, 7 cases, with 2 deaths.\r\n\r\nFor a full and severe examination of the reports, statistics, and\r\nother evidence concerning this and other outbreaks in which preventive\r\ninoculations were made, the Report (1901) of the Indian Plague\r\nCommission must be studied. The Commissioners, Professor T. R. Fraser,\r\nMr. J. P. Hewett, Professor (now Sir) A. E. Wright, Mr. A. Cumine, Dr.\r\nRuffer, and Mr. C. J. Hallifax, Secretary, travelled and took evidence\r\nin India from November 1898 to March 1899: during which time they held\r\n70 sittings and examined 260 witnesses, some at great length. The\r\nevidence and the report are published in five large volumes. The\r\nreport, 540 pages in all, deals exhaustively with the whole subject.\r\nIt represents the very least--what might almost be called the very\r\nworst--that can be said of Haffkine's fluid: and, of course, it reads\r\nrather differently from the reports of the men who, with their lives\r\nin their hands, and worked almost past endurance, fought plague\r\nthemselves. The following paragraphs give, so far as possible, the\r\nbare facts of various outbreaks of the disease in 1897-99, in which\r\nHaffkine's fluid was used.\r\n\r\n1. _Daman_\r\n\r\nPlague broke out in Daman, a town in Portuguese territory, north of\r\nBombay, and in constant communication with Bombay by sea, in March\r\n1897. By the end of the month, when a Government cordon was placed\r\nround the town, about 2000 out of 10,900 had fled. The outbreak\r\nreached its height in mid-April, and was practically over by the end\r\nof May. Inoculations were begun on 26th March. The total population on\r\nthat day (2000 having gone out, and 670 having died of plague) is\r\nestimated at 8230. Of these, 2197 were inoculated, and 6033 were left\r\nuninoculated. Among the inoculated there were 36 deaths = 1.6 per\r\ncent.; among the uninoculated 1482 deaths = 24.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners criticise these figures severely, and do not accept\r\nthem as exact. But they admit the evidence as to the results of\r\ninoculation among the Parsee community of Daman. Of this community,\r\n306 in number, 277 were inoculated, and only 29 were left\r\nuninoculated. Among the inoculated there was 1 death = 0.36 per cent.:\r\namong the uninoculated there were 4 deaths = 13.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nThey admit, also, the house-to-house investigations made by Major\r\nLyons, I.M.S., President of the Bombay Government Plague Committee. At\r\nthe end of May, he visited 89 houses, in 62 of which both inoculated\r\nand uninoculated were living together. He found that out of 382\r\ninoculated, 36 had died = 9.4 per cent.; out of 123 uninoculated, 38\r\nhad died = 30.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n2. _Lanauli_\r\n\r\nPlague attacked Lanauli, a small hill-station and railway depot,\r\nduring April to September 1897. The entire population was estimated at\r\nabout 2000. Inoculations were begun on 24th July in two wards of the\r\ntown, and a daily house-to-house inspection was instituted. The\r\nfigures reported, on the basis of the average daily strength of the\r\ntwo groups, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Inoculated, 323, with 14 cases, of which 7 died = 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n   Uninoculated, 377, with 78 cases, of which 57 died = 15 per\r\n   cent.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners criticise the method on which these figures are\r\nbased, and do not accept them as accurate. But they agree that\r\ninoculation \"exerted a distinct preventive effect\"; and they admit\r\nMajor Baker's evidence--\"In the place where inoculation had been made\r\nuse of, the town was thriving and full of people; and the other part\r\nof the town was absolutely empty. One side had plague, and the other\r\nhad none.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Kirki_\r\n\r\nThe figures here were obtained under especially favourable\r\ncircumstances; and the Commissioners have, practically, no fault to\r\nfind with their accuracy. The following account is by Surgeon-Major\r\nBannerman, Superintendent of the Plague Research Laboratory, Bombay:--\r\n\r\n   \"Plague broke out in Kirki, in the artillery cantonment,\r\n   situated four miles from Poona; and the followers of the four\r\n   batteries stationed there suffered severely. These men were\r\n   living with their families in lines on a sloping plain, under\r\n   military discipline, and in circumstances far superior in a\r\n   sanitary sense to those of the average villager. When the\r\n   disease appeared, the lines were isolated, so that none could\r\n   enter or leave without the knowledge of the military. A special\r\n   hospital was erected close by, where all sick persons were sent\r\n   as they were discovered by the search parties of European\r\n   artillerymen, who visited each house thrice daily. It is\r\n   therefore probable that all cases of plague were promptly\r\n   discovered and removed to hospital: and in each case the usual\r\n   disinfection was thoroughly and systematically carried out. Yet,\r\n   in spite of all this, it was found that, in those not protected\r\n   by inoculation, 1 out of every 6 of the population was attacked,\r\n   and 2 out of every 3 attacked died. The epidemic was, therefore,\r\n   a severe one. The population of the lines numbered 1530; and,\r\n   out of these, 671 volunteered for inoculation. At the close of\r\n   the epidemic, the plague-hospital admission and discharge book\r\n   was examined, and compared with the register of those\r\n   inoculated, when the following result was got. The population\r\n   operated on being under military discipline, and confined to\r\n   their lines, makes the accuracy of the figures undoubted:--\r\n\r\n   Inoculated, 671, with 32 cases, of which 17 died = 2.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n   Uninoculated, 859, with 143 cases, of which 98 died = 11.4 per\r\n   cent.\r\n\r\n   \"Here, then, is seen a body of people divided into two groups\r\n   by the fact that one had undergone inoculation and the other\r\n   not, _but differing in no other way_, reacting towards plague in\r\n   such a markedly different manner that the conclusion is forced\r\n   on one, that the inoculation must be the cause. Seeing the\r\n   absolute similarity of conditions, _the 671 inoculated should\r\n   have had proportionately 112 cases and 77 deaths, if they had\r\n   remained as susceptible to the disease as their uninoculated\r\n   brothers, sisters, parents, wives, husbands, children; but,\r\n   instead of that, they had only 32 cases and 17 deaths_. This\r\n   death-rate would doubtless have been still further reduced, but\r\n   for the fact that a very much weakened vaccine had to be used,\r\n   owing to the demand having got beyond the resources of the\r\n   laboratory at that time.\"\r\n\r\n4. _Belgaum_\r\n\r\nIn Belgaum, a town of Southern India with a normal population of about\r\n30,700, two outbreaks of plague occurred in quick succession. The\r\nfirst outbreak lasted from November 1897 to May 1898; the second, from\r\nJuly 1898 to January 1899. During the two epidemics, 2466 persons were\r\ninoculated. Of these, it was reported that only 61 (or 62) had been\r\nattacked, of whom 33 died = 1.34 per cent. But these figures, in the\r\njudgment of the Commission, cannot be accepted as even approximately\r\ncorrect. There are, however, two groups of these Belgaum cases, one of\r\nwhich the Commission admits as substantially accurate, and the other\r\nas absolutely accurate. These groups are, (1) the Army cases; (2) the\r\ncases reported by Major Forman, R.A.M.C., Senior Medical Officer of\r\nthe Station.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Army Cases._-These cases occurred in the 26th Madras\r\nInfantry, which was living in lines close to the cantonment and the\r\ncity. The first case of plague in the regiment was on 12th November\r\n1897. Ten days later, the regiment was moved out into camp.\r\nInoculation was begun, by Surgeon-Major Bannerman, on 23rd December,\r\nup to which time there had been, among the regiment and its families\r\nand followers, 78 cases, with 49 deaths. The following account of the\r\ninoculations is given by Surgeon-Major Bannerman:--\r\n\r\n   \"No difficulty was experienced in persuading the men to consent\r\n   to inoculation, when it was explained to them that they would be\r\n   free to return to their houses in the lines after being operated\r\n   on. General Rolland was the first to be operated on, and his\r\n   example, combined with that of the officer commanding, and their\r\n   medical officer, who were all operated on in front of the men,\r\n   sufficed to convince the Sepoys of the harmlessness of the\r\n   operation: and the only difficulty that then remained was to\r\n   perform the operation fast enough.... The community was,\r\n   practically, completely inoculated by the end of the year. The\r\n   total operated on was 1665, out of a population of 1746 living\r\n   in the lines at that date. The 81 not operated on were infants,\r\n   women far advanced in pregnancy, and the sick in hospital\r\n   chiefly, though one solitary Sepoy has, up to the present time,\r\n   refused to submit to operation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward to the end of the first epidemic, though the\r\ndisease was at its height in January in the neighbouring city and\r\ncantonment, and though the men were allowed to go freely to these\r\nplaces after inoculation, _only 2 out of the 1665 were attacked, and\r\nboth recovered_.\r\n\r\nWhen the second epidemic came, in July 1898, the troops, families, and\r\nfollowers, were reinoculated at their own request, 1801 in all.\r\n\"Practically no one was left in the lines unprotected by inoculation.\"\r\nFrom this time onward to the end of the second epidemic, though it\r\nwas much more severe than the first, only 12 cases occurred. _In the\r\nfirst epidemic, before inoculation, 78 cases occurred, and 2 after it:\r\nin the second, and much more severe, epidemic, though the sanitary\r\nmeasures adopted in both epidemics were similar, only 12 cases\r\noccurred._ \"It would hardly appear to be open to doubt,\" says the\r\nCommission, \"that the practical immunity of the regiment, during the\r\nsecond outbreak, was due to inoculation.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Major Forman's evidence before the Commission is very striking,\r\nthough the figures are small. The following abstract of it is given in\r\nthe Report of the Commission:--\r\n\r\n   \"The groups of persons, concerning whom Major Forman gave us\r\n   evidence, were his private servants, and the hospital attendants\r\n   of the Belgaum Station Hospital with their wives and children.\r\n   He inoculated these groups when plague first broke out in the\r\n   town, and was able to keep in touch with them continuously after\r\n   that time. Regarding the first group, he says, bringing down\r\n   their history to 3rd March 1899, 'Of my private servants there\r\n   were in all, including their wives and children, 28 people\r\n   inoculated. There have been no cases of plague, and no deaths up\r\n   to date. There were 3 uninoculated. One was a child of 9 years\r\n   of age, whose father refused to allow it to be inoculated. It\r\n   died of plague 12 days after the other people were inoculated.\r\n   The other 2 cases that were not inoculated were not so\r\n   distinctly under my own observation. One was a sweeper employed\r\n   in the cantonment, and sleeping in my compound: he, I am told,\r\n   died of plague some months afterwards. The other was my\r\n   water-carrier: he threw himself into a well: I was informed that\r\n   he had buboes and fever, and ran away to escape segregation. Of\r\n   the 28 inoculated, none died of plague: and of 3 uninoculated,\r\n   2 are said to have died of plague, and 1 undoubtedly died of\r\n   plague.'\"\r\n\r\n   \"Regarding the second group of which he gave us particulars,\r\n   Major Forman said that, out of 90 hospital servants, 87 were\r\n   inoculated. Of the inoculated persons, 1 died from fever and\r\n   endocarditis, and 1 died of plague. Excepting these two, the\r\n   rest of the inoculated were alive and well in March 1899. Only 3\r\n   persons remained uninoculated. Of these, one was not operated\r\n   upon, because she had recently been delivered; another was not\r\n   operated upon, because she was pregnant; and the third was a boy\r\n   of 16 years of age, whose father refused to let him be\r\n   inoculated. The boy died of plague, two months after the\r\n   inoculation of the rest of the hospital servants had been done.\r\n   One of the two uninoculated women died of plague two days after\r\n   the boy, she having been in attendance upon him. The other\r\n   uninoculated woman remained well.\"\r\n\r\n5. _The Umarkhadi Jail, Bombay_\r\n\r\nPlague broke out in this jail on the last day of 1897, and 3 prisoners\r\ndied. Next day, 1st January 1898, all the prisoners were paraded, and\r\nall were willing to be inoculated. But it was decided to divide them\r\ninto two equal groups, and inoculate one group. There were 402\r\naltogether: 2, when their turn came, refused to be inoculated: thus\r\n199 were inoculated, and 203 were left uninoculated. No distinction\r\nwas made between the two groups: \"They had the same food and drink,\r\nthe same hours of work and rest, and the same accommodation.\" The\r\nplague did not come wholly to an end till March. The figures, since\r\nthe inmates of a jail are a shifting population, are based on the\r\naverage daily number of each group: this was 147 for the inoculated,\r\nand 127 for the uninoculated. The figures are:--\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------+--------+---------+\r\n    | Average Daily Number. | Cases. | Deaths. |\r\n    +-----------------------+--------+---------+\r\n    | Inoculated      147   |   3    |    0    |\r\n    | Uninoculated    127   |   9    |    5    |\r\n    +-----------------------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe Commission draw attention to \"the important fact that, during the\r\nwhole period of the outbreak, the number of attacks among the\r\ninoculated was only one-third of the number among the uninoculated;\r\nand that the disease among the inoculated was remarkably mild,\r\nresembling mumps more than plague, though the cases among the\r\nuninoculated were of average severity.\" According to Surgeon-Major\r\nBannerman, the hospital authorities were doubtful whether these three\r\ncases among the inoculated were plague at all.\r\n\r\n6. _Undhera_\r\n\r\nThe figures for Undhera are very valuable: \"The conditions,\" says\r\nSurgeon-Major Bannerman, \"approached very nearly the strictness of a\r\nlaboratory experiment.\" Even the Commissioners are enthusiastic here.\r\n\r\nUndhera is an agricultural village, 6 miles from Baroda. Plague broke\r\nout in it, in January 1898. A careful census was taken, and showed a\r\npopulation of 1029. By 12th February there had been 76 deaths. On that\r\nday the village was visited by Mr. Haffkine, Surgeon-Major Bannerman,\r\nand other experts, and 513 persons were inoculated:--_By reference to\r\nthe census papers, the whole of the inhabitants were called out, house\r\nby house, and the half of each household inoculated. In this way, an\r\nendeavour was made to inoculate half the men, half the women, and half\r\nthe children in each family, and to arrange that a fairly equal\r\nproportion of the sickly-looking should be placed in each division._\r\nThe plague lasted 42 days after the inoculations, and affected 28\r\nfamilies. On 4th April a house-to-house investigation was made by Mr.\r\nHaffkine, Surgeon-General Harvey, Surgeon-Major Bannerman, and Captain\r\nDyson. The figures are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +---------------+-------------------+------+-------+-------------+\r\n    |Population on  |                   |Cases.|Deaths.| Mortality.  |\r\n    |12th February. |                   |      |       |             |\r\n    +---------------+-------------------+--------------+-------------+\r\n    |1029 - 76 = 953| Inoculated,   513 |  8   |   3   |0.6 per cent.|\r\n    |               | Uninoculated, 440 | 28   |  27   |6.0 per cent.|\r\n    +---------------+-------------------+------+-------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThus, out of 28 families, where the protected and the unprotected\r\nlived and ate and slept together, the protected, 71, had 3 deaths; and\r\nthe unprotected, 64, had 27. The percentage of attacks was four times\r\nhigher among the unprotected; the percentage of deaths was ten times\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n7. _Khoja Community, Bombay_\r\n\r\nThe head of this community, H.H. Sir Sultan Shah, Aga Khan, K.C.I.E.,\r\nopened a private station for the inoculation of the community in March\r\n1897, and again in December of that year. He was himself inoculated\r\nthree times, and many of the community so often as five times. The\r\nwork of inoculation went on daily, and by 20th April 1898 the number\r\nof persons inoculated or reinoculated was 5184. The whole community,\r\naccording to a careful census taken at the beginning of 1898, numbered\r\n9350; but, since many families had fled to avoid the infection, this\r\nnumber is too low. The Commissioners guess 9770: Haffkine, to the\r\ndisadvantage of his own statistics, guesses so high as 13,330. The\r\nnumber of the inoculated or reinoculated shifted, of course, as the\r\nwork went on: their average daily number during the four months of\r\nplague, January to April 1898, was 3814.\r\n\r\nDuring these four months, the number of deaths _from all causes_ in\r\nthe whole community was 184. According to the average mortality of the\r\ncommunity in times of no plague, the deaths _from all causes_ during\r\nfour months would be 102. It may fairly be assumed that the extra\r\ndeaths, 82, were due to plague: and, indeed, 64 plague-deaths were\r\neither acknowledged by the relatives, or certified by the burial-books\r\nof the community. _Of these 82 deaths, 3 occurred among the inoculated\r\nor reinoculated, and 77 among the uninoculated._\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners find fault with these figures: \"Nevertheless, quite\r\napart from the statistics put before us, which we think inaccurate, we\r\ndo not doubt that inoculations had a good effect, especially as much\r\nweight must be allowed to the opinion of a community so intelligent as\r\nthat of the Khojas.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Hubli_\r\n\r\nThis, the greatest and most amazing of all instances of preventive\r\nplague-work, was done in a town of 50,000 persons. The following\r\nreport, by Surgeon-Captain Leumann, was forwarded to the Plague\r\nCommissioners by Mr. E. K. Cappel, Collector of Dhárwár, with this\r\ncomment:--\r\n\r\n   \"The town of Hubli--a mercantile town of over 50,000\r\n   inhabitants--was attacked by plague in an epidemic form at the\r\n   commencement of the monsoon rains. The average rainfall between\r\n   April and October amounts to more than 28 inches. Under these\r\n   circumstances, although a large and weather-proof health camp\r\n   had been prepared for emergencies, complete evacuation of the\r\n   infected townsite was impossible; and the attempt to effect it\r\n   would have led to the severest hardships and to the immediate\r\n   spread of the disease into surrounding villages and districts.\r\n   It was for this reason that the determination was formed to make\r\n   a bold and comprehensive experiment with the prophylactic, and\r\n   not on any _à priori_ grounds. If this experiment had failed,\r\n   the results, judged by the actual mortality among the\r\n   uninoculated, would have been appalling. _All possible sanitary\r\n   measures in the shape of disinfection, unroofing of houses, and\r\n   segregation, were applied concurrently with inoculation, as\r\n   Government are already aware; but the rate of mortality among\r\n   those who held back from inoculation rose at one time to a\r\n   height which, I believe, has never been approached\r\n   elsewhere...._\r\n\r\n   \"However, the experiment, in the hands of Dr. Leumann, did not\r\n   fail, and it has afforded a demonstration of success which is of\r\n   Imperial importance. Many thousands of lives have undoubtedly\r\n   been saved, and at the present moment the plague mortality is\r\n   merely sporadic, and Hubli is steadily regaining its normal\r\n   population and trade, though surrounded by infected villages.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hubli report must be put at full length, for the vivid picture it\r\ngives of plague in India, and of the difficulties besetting the\r\nmagnificent work of the Indian Medical Service. It is a story that Mr.\r\nKipling ought to write. And it is to be noted that Surgeon-Captain\r\nLeumann, who saved Hubli, recognised the extreme importance of other\r\nmethods than inoculation--disinfection, isolation of cases, evacuation\r\nof infected districts. He says:--\r\n\r\n   \"While paying the highest tribute to the value of Mr. Haffkine's\r\n   inoculation method, which I claim, here in Hubli, to have put to\r\n   perhaps the severest test to which it has yet been subjected, I\r\n   am of the opinion that individual protection is, on however\r\n   great a scale conducted, of less importance to that of general\r\n   protection and hygiene (considering each method separately, that\r\n   is to say), for it seems to me more radical, if not more\r\n   rational, to eradicate a disease than to leave it to pursue its\r\n   course and only protect people against its ravages.\"\r\n\r\nSanitation, therefore, was Dr. Leumann's faith. Now for his works:--\r\n\r\n   \"I first started inoculation here on 11th May.... When I began\r\n   my inoculations, I operated first of all on some European or\r\n   native gentlemen in front of a crowd of poor and low-caste\r\n   people, whom I had gathered together in the worst-affected area,\r\n   and they were thus soon induced to ask for inoculation\r\n   themselves.... They have presented themselves, by the hundred,\r\n   at all times of the day, before myself and others, for the\r\n   purpose of being inoculated.[34] ... I have never experienced\r\n   the slightest difficulty in inoculating Mussulmanis or any\r\n   other purdáh women in Hubli.... The very men who, in March last,\r\n   created a disturbance in Hubli, were not only the first and the\r\n   most willing to undergo inoculation, but also to bring their\r\n   wives and families to my hospital, or to invite me to their\r\n   homes to inoculate them.\r\n\r\n  [34] Compare the account of the inoculations at Gaday, in the\r\n  _Lancet_, 11th February 1898: \"To see the crowd waiting and\r\n  struggling to pass the barrier is a strange sight; old men and\r\n  women, young children, and mothers with babes in their arms, form\r\n  a daily crowd numbered by hundreds, who wait for hours to get\r\n  their chance of the day's inoculation.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Inoculated persons holding certificates of double inoculation\r\n   have, at my special wish and order, been left in their homes\r\n   throughout this epidemic; only their clothes, house, and\r\n   property being disinfected on the occurrence of a plague case or\r\n   death in their house. As the vast majority of plague cases have\r\n   never been notified before death in Hubli (nor, in my experience\r\n   of nearly two years, elsewhere, if native supervision be largely\r\n   resorted to), it will readily be understood that the majority of\r\n   the inoculated have actually been living in the same house, or\r\n   even room, with a plague case (often of the pneumonic type,\r\n   whose terrible power of spreading the disease was first shown by\r\n   Professor Childe, I.M.S., of Bombay) during the whole of the\r\n   time that case was living, probably attending on the patient,\r\n   breathing the same stuffy air, and, perhaps, sharing the same\r\n   blanket; and I attach at the end of this report a long series of\r\n   cases where such conditions have occurred, _the non-inoculated\r\n   dying of plague, and the inoculated escaping, almost to a man_.\r\n\r\n   \"Various critics on my work, not knowing what the actual facts\r\n   were and are, have at different times asserted that the\r\n   inoculated inhabitants of Hubli left the town in larger numbers\r\n   than the non-inoculated. Exactly the reverse was the case. The\r\n   British officers on plague duty here, and all the Divisional\r\n   Superintendents, invariably replied (officially and in writing\r\n   when so required) that the non-inoculated left Hubli in far\r\n   greater numbers and proportion than the inoculated; and my own\r\n   observations entirely bear out this statement.\r\n\r\n   \"It has been urged that those who received inoculation were of a\r\n   class or classes better protected than others against plague by\r\n   reason of their habits, the food they eat, the houses they live\r\n   in, etc. In reply, I unhesitatingly state that if there be but\r\n   one town in India where that line of argument will not hold\r\n   good, it certainly is Hubli; for _not only were the poorer,\r\n   dirtier, lower-caste people the first to be persuaded to receive\r\n   inoculation, but I made it my personal and special duty to work\r\n   amongst them_. My first few thousand inoculations were almost\r\n   entirely amongst the lowest and poorest of the people. The\r\n   Brahmins are, perhaps, of all castes, supposed to be the most\r\n   cleanly in their houses, habits, etc., yet the Brahmins of Hubli\r\n   (who at first, imagining themselves immune, were the foremost\r\n   and greatest perverters of the truth concerning its efficacy,\r\n   and the last to apply for the protection inoculation affords),\r\n   simply inundated the various inoculation centres, as soon as\r\n   plague began to spread in their midst, clamouring for the very\r\n   method of which they had only lately tried to prevent others\r\n   from availing themselves.\r\n\r\n   \"Unfortunately, the average native, educated or not, appears to\r\n   have the very greatest aversion to notifying any case of\r\n   sickness--plague or other--and hence, in my opinion, it becomes\r\n   more necessary than ever to protect the people by inoculation,\r\n   since they will not help to protect themselves by the foremost\r\n   and simplest of sanitary and hygienic measures.[35] With so few\r\n   police (and those none too good) to help one; an inadequate\r\n   British Staff; with so much reliance placed in Native\r\n   Superintendents and Supervisors, and a Municipality so bankrupt\r\n   that it could not apparently afford to buy enough blankets out\r\n   of its own funds for the patients in the Plague Hospitals--the\r\n   work of segregation, house-to-house inspection, etc., became,\r\n   from a medical point of view, absurdly insufficient.\r\n\r\n   \"The total number of inoculations performed in Hubli, both on\r\n   actual inhabitants and on people from outside (villages) between\r\n   11th May and 27th September, amounts to some 78,000 altogether.\"\r\n\r\n  [35] Compare the account given by the Rev. H. Haigh (_Methodist\r\n  Recorder_, December 1898), of the plague at Bangalore: \"The native\r\n  population do all they can to elude the vigilance of the\r\n  authorities. In order to escape segregation, the householders in\r\n  many instances refrain from reporting plague, and not infrequently\r\n  bury the corpse secretly. Not only is any spare piece of ground\r\n  used as a burial-place, but the body is at times thrown into a\r\n  well or tank, or dropped over the wall of some European compound.\r\n  During one week three plague corpses were found, badly decomposed,\r\n  in reservoirs commonly resorted to for drinking purposes.\"\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n    +------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------------+\r\n    |            |         |           |           |     Plague-deaths |\r\n    |            |         |           |           |         among:    |\r\n    |  Dates.    |Census of|   Non-    |Inoculated.+-----------+-------+\r\n    |            | Hubli.  |Inoculated.|           |   Non-    |Inocul-|\r\n    |            |         |           |           |Inoculated.| ated. |\r\n    +------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------+\r\n    |Five weeks  |Fell from|           |           |           |       |\r\n    | from May 11|50,000 to|           |           |           |       |\r\n    | to June 14 | 47,427  |  44,573   |  2,854    |    47     |   1   |\r\n    |            |         |           |           |           |       |\r\n    |Week ending:|         |           |           |           |       |\r\n    |  June 21   | 47,082  |  41,494   |  5,588    |    22     |   3   |\r\n    |  June 28   | 47,485  |  39,042   |  8,443    |    29     |   1   |\r\n    |  July 5    | 46,537  |  36,020   | 10,517    |    55     |   6   |\r\n    |  July 12   | 46,518  |  33,255   | 13,263    |    34     |   6   |\r\n    |  July 19   | 45,240  |  29,716   | 15,524    |    82     |   7   |\r\n    |  July 26   | 43,809  |  24,112   | 19,697    |   100     |  15   |\r\n    |  Aug. 2    | 43,707  |  21,031   | 22,676    |   140     |  16   |\r\n    |  Aug. 9    | 42,768  |  15,584   | 27,184    |   272     |  19   |\r\n    |  Aug. 16   | 40,441  |  10,685   | 29,756    |   386     |  61   |\r\n    |  Aug. 23   | 39,400  |   6,367   | 33,033    |   371     |  41   |\r\n    |  Aug. 30   | 38,210  |   4,094   | 34,116    |   328     |  28   |\r\n    |  Sept. 6   | 38,382  |   2,731   | 35,469    |   227     |  34   |\r\n    |  Sept. 13  | 38,408  |   1,116   | 37,292    |   138     |  47   |\r\n    |  Sept. 20  | 39,142  |     937   | 38,205    |   106     |  55   |\r\n    |  Sept. 27  | 39,315  |     603   | 38,712    |    58     |  20   |\r\n    +------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------+\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n    +---------------+-------------------------+----------------------+\r\n    |               |    Plague death-rate.   |                      |\r\n    |               |   Comparison per 1000   | Percentage reduction |\r\n    |    Dates.     |         between         | of Plague death-rate |\r\n    |               +------------+------------+   in favour of the   |\r\n    |               |    Non-    | Inoculated.|      Inoculated.     |\r\n    |               | Inoculated.|            |                      |\r\n    +---------------+------------+------------+----------------------+\r\n    | Five weeks    |            |            |                      |\r\n    |  from May 11  |            |            |                      |\r\n    |  to June 14   |    1.022   |    .350    | Over   65 per cent.  |\r\n    |               |            |            |                      |\r\n    | Week ending:  |            |            |                      |\r\n    |   June 21     |     .530   |    .527    | About   1 per cent.  |\r\n    |   June 28     |     .742   |    .118    | Nearly 85 per cent.  |\r\n    |   July 5      |    1.524   |    .570    | About  63 per cent.  |\r\n    |   July 12     |    1.022   |    .452    | Nearly 56 per cent.  |\r\n    |   July 19     |    2.793   |    .450    |        84 per cent.  |\r\n    |   July 26     |    4.147   |    .761    |        82 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Aug. 2      |    6.656   |    .705    |        89 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Aug. 9      |   17.325   |    .698    | Over   96 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Aug. 16     |   33.694   |   2.083    |        94 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Aug. 23     |   57.011   |   1.241    |        98 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Aug. 30     |   80.116   |    .820    |        98 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Sept. 6     |   83.112   |    .958    |        99 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Sept. 13    |  112.903   |   1.260    | Over   99 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Sept. 20    |  113.127   |   1.439    | Over   99 per cent.  |\r\n    |   Sept. 27    |   96.185   |    .517    | Over   99 per cent.  |\r\n    +---------------+------------+------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\n   \"It appears that if the 47,427 inhabitants had remained, as they\r\n   did--in their town, without running away by rail or otherwise,\r\n   or without camping out in a mass--and if no inoculation had been\r\n   resorted to--they would have lost 24,899 souls, or a little over\r\n   half of their number. The official records show that this has\r\n   actually occurred, during the present terrible outbreak, in a\r\n   number of large villages, of 2000 inhabitants and over, in the\r\n   Hubli _taluka_ and elsewhere in the Dhárwár District, where no\r\n   inoculation was done, and no camping-out was possible on account\r\n   of the wet weather.\" (Haffkine's commentary on Dr. Leumann's\r\n   report.)\r\n\r\nThat is the story of Hubli; and, as it stands, it is almost\r\nincredible. The Commissioners, by very strict inquiry, reduced it to\r\ncredibility without robbing it of glory. The inquiry brought out more\r\ninstances of the immeasurable difficulty of the work. Natives who\r\nwished to avoid inoculation would escape through the back door at the\r\nsight of a plague officer: bribery, personation, sale or transfer of\r\ncertificates of inoculation, concealment of cases and of deaths, were\r\nall practised by those who wished not to be inoculated, or to get the\r\nprivileges of the inoculated without inoculation, or to save their\r\ninfected houses from being disinfected and unroofed. Again, with the\r\npeople dying like flies, and many of them bearing no mark of\r\nidentification, and with the medical officers overworked past human\r\nendurance, the wonder is, not that the statistics were faulty, but\r\nthat there are any statistics at all. Certainly, the Commission is\r\nwell within the mark in saying, \"It is quite clear that a very large\r\nnumber of lives must have been saved in Hubli by inoculations during\r\nthe whole course of the epidemic there. _Moreover, we may note that an\r\narithmetical estimate is not the only criterion by which we can\r\nappreciate the value of inoculations. And in Hubli their value is\r\napproved by the consensus of opinions of officers who have seen\r\nprobably far more of this process and its results in practice than any\r\nother persons in India, and who, having every facility for forming a\r\nsound judgment as to its effect where plague was really virulent, are\r\nsatisfied as to its great value._\"\r\n\r\nFinally, as at Daman so at Hubli, there are lesser groups of\r\nstatistics, of that kind which is _approved by the consensus of\r\nopinions of officers_. These are, (1) Lieutenant Keelan's\r\nhouse-to-house investigation; (2) the Southern Mahratta Spinning\r\nMills; (3) the Southern Mahratta Railway employés.\r\n\r\n1. Lieutenant Keelan made a house-to-house visitation of 200 houses,\r\nin each of which there were protected and unprotected persons living\r\ntogether, and in each of which there had been one or more cases of\r\nplague. The figures for 69 of these houses are appended to Captain\r\nLeumann's report. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +----------------+----------+--------+---------+------------+\r\n    |                | Inmates. | Cases. | Deaths. | Mortality. |\r\n    +----------------+----------+--------+---------+------------+\r\n    | Inoculated     |   336    |   11   |   4     |    1.19    |\r\n    | Uninoculated   |   144    |   84   |  80     |   55       |\r\n    +----------------+----------+--------+---------+------------+\r\n\r\nThese 69 houses were selected: there was nothing unfair in the method\r\nof selection, still, they were \"good houses\"; they are not, therefore,\r\nexact for statistics; but, as the Commissioners say, they are \"of\r\ninterest as quite special examples of successful inoculation.\"\r\n\r\n2. In the Southern Mahratta Spinning and Weaving Company's Mills, a\r\ncareful record of inoculation was kept and checked by the manager. The\r\nnumber of the workpeople at the time when inoculation was begun, 21st\r\nJune, was 1173. At the end of the epidemic the figures were:--\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------+---------+---------------+\r\n    |                          | Deaths. | Mortality per |\r\n    |                          |         |     cent.     |\r\n    +--------------------------+---------+---------------+\r\n    | Inoculated twice    1040 |   22    |     2.11      |\r\n    | Inoculated once       58 |    8    |    13.79      |\r\n    | Uninoculated          75 |   20    |    26.66      |\r\n    +--------------------------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\nHere, again, the figures have not a statistical value: \"We are not\r\ninformed whether the inoculations were performed simultaneously; or at\r\nwhat stage of the outbreak the average strength of the inoculated was\r\nreached.\" All the same, what Major Bannerman says of them is\r\ntrue--_The experience in this company's mill at_ _Hubli should be an\r\nobject lesson to all mill-owners in plague-stricken towns._\r\n\r\n3. The figures for the Southern Mahratta Railway are given by Major\r\nBannerman in his \"Statistics\" (1900): they are not mentioned in the\r\nReport of the Plague Commission. They are of great value, because the\r\ndaily shifting of the numbers was recorded as the work of inoculation\r\nwent on, and the date of each case of plague was also noted. Major\r\nBannerman gives the following account:--\r\n\r\n   \"The railway employés were living in barracks, and in the\r\n   railway yard, apart from the general population of Hubli town.\r\n   _They were under close daily inspection by English officials_,\r\n   who formed a committee for this purpose, with Dr. Chenai as\r\n   their medical adviser. The results may therefore be regarded as\r\n   accurate in a high degree, the numbers dealt with not being\r\n   excessive, and the supervision strict.\"\r\n\r\nThe figures, based on the average numbers in each group, are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    +------------------------+--------+---------+---------------+\r\n    |                        | Cases. | Deaths. | Mortality per |\r\n    |                        |        |         |     cent.     |\r\n    +------------------------+--------+---------+---------------+\r\n    | Twice inoculated   990 |    6   |    1    |      0.1      |\r\n    | Once inoculated    270 |    5   |    1    |      0.3      |\r\n    | Uninoculated       760 |   35   |   21    |      2.7      |\r\n    +------------------------+--------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThese eight instances must suffice: many must be left out--among them,\r\nDhárwár and Gadag, where Miss Corthorn, M.B., did work as splendid as\r\nLeumann's work at Hubli; and Mr. Anderson's work in the Ahmednagar\r\nvillages; and many more. These plague-reports are to be read, not for\r\ntheir record of heroic zeal and resourcefulness, but only as one more\r\nexample of many thousand lives saved by a method learned from\r\nexperiments on animals.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there is not, and perhaps there never will be, a\r\nnational acceptance and adoption of this method through the length and\r\nbreadth of India. It does not work miracles; it is an uncomfortable\r\nprocess to submit to; privileges must be offered with it, or the\r\nnative will often prefer to take his chance; the protection is of\r\nuncertain duration; all sorts of lies are told about it, partly by\r\nanti-vivisectionist writers, partly by native political agitators,\r\npartly by the _hakims_. For instance, at a meeting of _hakims_ at\r\nMasti, Lahore, on 11th April 1898, the following resolutions were\r\npassed:--\r\n\r\n   \"That in the opinion of this meeting the bubonic plague is not a\r\n   contagious disease. It originates from poisoned air, and this\r\n   poison is created in the air on account of atmospherical germs\r\n   and the excess of terrestrial humidities.\r\n\r\n   \"That this meeting, having carefully considered the Resolution\r\n   of the Punjab Government (11th January 1898), is of opinion that\r\n   the rules embodied in that Resolution (isolation, disinfection,\r\n   etc.), are unnecessary under the principles of Unani medical\r\n   science.\"\r\n\r\nAnd among statements to be made to the Plague Commissioners was the\r\nfollowing, from a native practitioner in Bombay (April 1899):--\r\n\r\n   \"I do not think the plague was imported in Bombay from Hong Kong\r\n   or anywhere else. I attribute three sources of causes of\r\n   outbreaks of plague in Bombay:\r\n\r\n   (_a_) The predisposing cause was the Bombay Municipality; (_b_)\r\n   The exciting cause was the Nature herself; (_c_) The aggravating\r\n   cause was the Plague Committee.\"\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties were well stated by Surgeon-General Harvey,\r\nDirector-General of the Indian Medical Service, at the discussion on\r\nHaffkine's discourse before the Royal Society, June 1899:--\r\n\r\n   \"The people of England should consider the difficulties\r\n   attending the work of a bacteriologist in India.... He had no\r\n   doubt as to the value of the inoculations. At Undhera he\r\n   carefully examined the results of the experiment, and, as far as\r\n   he could judge, there was no possibility of error. The results\r\n   in that experiment were such as to be 90 per cent. in favour of\r\n   the inoculated against the uninoculated. The natives of India\r\n   were, however, a strange people, and it was difficult to\r\n   prophesy how they would act. In Calcutta, the mention of\r\n   inoculations had driven in hot haste from the city 300,000\r\n   people, many of whom afterwards returned and were inoculated;\r\n   while at Hubli he had seen the inhabitants come in their\r\n   thousands to be inoculated and pay for the inoculations. The\r\n   medical officer in charge at Hubli had performed about 80,000\r\n   inoculations, and had only observed some 12 abscesses. He\r\n   thought that 12 abscesses only, in 80,000 inoculations, showed\r\n   good results. But, after all, what were the numbers of\r\n   inoculations performed to the 300,000,000 inhabitants of India?\r\n   He felt that even if every one consented to be inoculated it was\r\n   impossible to provide the vaccine or the medical officers for\r\n   such a demand. It was accordingly to sanitary improvements that\r\n   he looked with the most confidence to protect India against the\r\n   plague.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, now and for many years to come, preventive inoculation must\r\nfall into line with the other world-wide ways of fighting\r\nplague--quarantine, notification, isolation, all sanitary measures,\r\ndestruction of rats--_le rat, le génie de la peste_--evacuation of\r\ninfected towns, disinfection or unroofing of infected houses. Happily,\r\nthis is just what it does. That admirable paper, the _Indian Medical\r\nGazette_ (September 1901), has put this fact very simply: \"No one ever\r\nimagined that inoculation was the _only_ means of fighting plague. Its\r\ngreat value consists in its immediate application. To sanitate,\r\nventilate, and practically rebuild a town or village takes time; and\r\nin the meantime thousands die.\" For sudden outbursts of plague--since\r\nrats are one chief source of infection, and notification is\r\nfundamentally abhorrent to native custom, and evacuation may ruin\r\ntrade, or spread infection, or be impossible by reason of the\r\nrains--since \"East is East, and West is West\"--it is not always\r\npossible to provide, for an Indian village smitten by plague, the\r\nexcellent arrangements of the Western world. In all such cases, and in\r\nall cases of epidemic plague within narrow limits, as in jails,\r\nbarracks, mills, and the like centres of human life; and in all inner\r\ncommunities, such as the Parsee community at Daman, or the Jewish\r\ncommunity at Aden--by every test of this kind, the saving power of\r\npreventive inoculation has been proved, again and again, past all\r\ndoubt. As for those larger death-traps, Hubli, Dhárwár, and the rest\r\nof them, here, though the statistics are inexact, we have the word of\r\nthe men and women themselves who stood between the dead and the\r\nliving, and the plague was stayed. Such faults as there were, in 1899,\r\nin the treatment--the contamination of this or that stock of the\r\nfluid, and the inadequate method of standardisation--have been duly\r\nnoted by the Commission. The rush for the fluid in 1899 may be\r\nestimated from the following paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n   (i.) _Paris._ \"The preparation of anti-plague serum is being\r\n   rapidly proceeded with; up to the present time the Institute has\r\n   supplied it, in response to all the very numerous requests which\r\n   have come from Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Turkey, without\r\n   encroaching on the reserve kept in readiness for Paris and the\r\n   departments.\" (_Lancet_, 16th September 1899.)\r\n\r\n   (ii.) _India._ \"The spread of plague westward to Spain and\r\n   Portugal seems to have excited more or less general alarm, and I\r\n   hear that an unprecedented demand has suddenly arisen for the\r\n   plague prophylactic fluid. The Government of India have been\r\n   asked the cost of supplying from 50,000 to 100,000 doses, and\r\n   the earliest date at which this quantity could be despatched. It\r\n   is also desired to know if in case of need 50,000 doses a week\r\n   could be sent to London. Russia desires to obtain a considerable\r\n   stock for Port Arthur. Italy has been making inquiries for home\r\n   use; and also Portugal, in order to inoculate at Mozambique. The\r\n   present laboratory is at Government House, Parel, Bombay, and\r\n   has only recently been fitted up by the Government of India.\r\n   About 10,000 doses a day can be turned out, but it is thought\r\n   that still further enlargements will be required if the demand\r\n   should increase beyond this amount.\" (_Lancet_, 23rd September\r\n   1899.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would take too long for the present purpose to consider what has\r\nbeen done, not only for the prevention of plague, but also for its\r\ncure by a serum treatment. The results obtained by this treatment in\r\nIndia have not been very good; but Yersin and others report better\r\nresults in other countries. Good results are reported from Amoy\r\n(1896), Nhatrang (1898), Oporto (1899), and Buenos Ayres (1899-1900).\r\nIn Glasgow, the prophylactic use of Yersin's serum seems to have done\r\nexcellent service: the success of its curative use was not very\r\nstriking. The curative results at Nhatrang (Yersin, _Annales de\r\nl'Institut Pasteur_, March 1899) are notable. Nhatrang is an Annamese\r\nfishing-village; and the plague, when it was left to itself, killed\r\nevery case that it got:--\r\n\r\n   \"La peste s'est montrée excessivement meurtrière chez les\r\n   Annamites. Sur 72 cas de peste, 39 personnes chez lesquelles la\r\n   maladie a évolué normalement, ou qui n'ont été traités que par\r\n   des médecins indigènes, sont mortes sans exception. Les 33\r\n   autres cas ont pu être traités par le sérum, quelquefois dans de\r\n   bonnes conditions, mais le plus souvent quelques heures\r\n   seulement avant la mort. Malgré cela, nous avons obtenu 19\r\n   guérisons et 14 décès, ce qui fait une mortalité de 42 per\r\n   cent., chez les traités. _Ainsi, d'une part, 100 pour 100 de\r\n   mortalité chez les non-traités; de l'autre, 42 per cent. chez\r\n   les malades qui ont reçu du sérum._ Ces chiffres confirment les\r\n   résultats que j'avais obtenu en Chine en 1896.\"\r\n\r\nA long review of this curative treatment, fairly hopeful but nothing\r\nmore, is given in the Report of the Plague Commission, vol. v., pp.\r\n269-320. The Commissioners are of opinion that it ought not yet to be\r\nextended, as a general measure, over all the districts affected with\r\nplague; and that there is need of more work in bacteriology before it\r\ncan be thus extended. \"We desire to record our opinion that, though\r\nthe method of serum-therapy, as applied to plague, has not been\r\ncrowned with a therapeutic success in any way comparable to that\r\nobtained by the application of the serum method to the treatment of\r\ndiphtheria, _none the less the method of serum-therapy is in plague,\r\nas in other infectious diseases, the only method which holds forth a\r\nprospect of ultimate success._\"\r\n\r\nIt is a strange contrast, between this opinion and the statements made\r\nby the opponents of all experiments on animals. Some of these\r\nstatements will be found in Part IV. of this book. Happily for the\r\nworld, no amount of foul language can hinder the good work; and, when\r\nwe talk of _Empire-building_, and of _deeds that win the Empire_, we\r\nmust reckon bacteriology among them: as Lord Curzon did, in his speech\r\nat Calcutta, March 3, 1899--_What is this medical science we bring to\r\nyou? It is built on the bed-rock of pure irrefutable science; it is a\r\nboon which is offered to all, rich and poor, Hindu and Mohammedan,\r\nwoman and man._\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER. MALTA FEVER\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER\r\n\r\nThe names of Klebs, Eberth, and Koch, are associated with the\r\ndiscovery, in 1880-81, of the bacillus of enteric fever, _bacillus\r\ntyphosus_; and it was obtained in pure culture by Gaffky in 1884. It\r\nhas been studied from every point of view, in man and in animals; in\r\nthe blood, tissues, and excretions; in earth, air, water, milk, and\r\nfood; in its distribution, methods of growth, and chemical products.\r\nEspecially, the study of its chemical products has been directed\r\ntoward (1) immunisation against the disease, (2) bacteriological\r\ndiagnosis of the disease at an early stage.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first protective inoculations against typhoid is July\r\nto August 1896: they were made at Netley Hospital, by Professor Wright\r\nand Surgeon-Major Semple. The first inoculations in Germany, made by\r\nPfeiffer and Kolle, were published two months later. The story of\r\nthese famous Netley inoculations is told in the _British Medical\r\nJournal_, 30th January 1897. Eighteen men offered themselves--\r\n\r\n   \"A good deal of fever was developed in all cases, and sleep was\r\n   a good deal disturbed. These constitutional symptoms had to a\r\n   great extent passed away by the morning, and laboratory work\r\n   went on without interruption.... With two exceptions, all these\r\n   vaccinations were performed upon Medical Officers of the Army\r\n   or Indian Medical Services, or upon Surgeons on Probation who\r\n   were preparing to enter those services.\"\r\n\r\nGood luck attend all eighteen of them, and immunity against typhoid,\r\nwherever they are. The doses that they received were estimated in\r\nproportion to the dose that would kill a guinea-pig of 350-400 grammes\r\nweight; and the protective fluid contained no living bacilli:--\r\n\r\n   \"The advantages which are associated with the use of such 'dead\r\n   vaccines' are, first, that there is absolutely no risk of\r\n   producing actual typhoid fever by our inoculations; secondly,\r\n   that the vaccines may be handled and distributed through the\r\n   post without incurring any risk of disseminating the germs of\r\n   the disease; thirdly, that dead vaccines are probably less\r\n   subject to undergo alterations in their strength than living\r\n   vaccines.\"\r\n\r\nThe first use of the vaccine during an outbreak of typhoid was in\r\nOctober 1897, at the Kent County Lunatic Asylum. The treatment was\r\noffered to any of the working staff who desired it:--\r\n\r\n   \"All the medical staff, and a number of attendants, accepted the\r\n   offer. _Not one of those vaccinated--84 in number--contracted\r\n   typhoid fever: while of those unvaccinated and living under\r\n   similar conditions, 16 were attacked._ This is a significant\r\n   fact, though it should in fairness be stated that the water was\r\n   boiled after a certain date, and other precautions were taken,\r\n   so that the vaccination cannot be said to be altogether\r\n   responsible for the immunity. Still, the figures are striking.\"\r\n   (_Lancet_, 19th March 1898; see also Dr. Tew's paper, in _Public\r\n   Health_, April 1898.)\r\n\r\nCertainly, they are striking; so is the story of the eight young\r\nsubalterns on the Khartoum expedition, of whom six were vaccinated,\r\nand two took their chance. The six escaped typhoid, the two were\r\nattacked by it, and one died. But these figures are too small to be of\r\nmuch value.\r\n\r\nThe first anti-typhoid inoculations on a large scale were made among\r\nBritish troops in India (Bangalore, Rawal Pindi, Lucknow), when the\r\nPlague Commission, of which Professor Wright was a member, was in\r\nIndia, November 1898 to March 1899. These inoculations were voluntary,\r\nat private cost, and without official sanction; though the original\r\nproposal for them, in 1897, had come from the Indian Government.\r\nPending official sanction, they were stopped. Then, on 25th May 1899,\r\nthe Indian Government made application to the Secretary of State for\r\nIndia that they should be sanctioned, and should be made at the public\r\ncost. The application is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"The annual admissions _per mille_ for enteric fever amongst\r\n   British troops in India have risen from 18.5 in 1890 to 32.4 in\r\n   1897, while the death-rate has increased from 4.01 to 9.01; and\r\n   we are of opinion that every practicable means should be tried\r\n   to guard against the ravages made by this disease. The\r\n   anti-typhoid inoculations have been, we believe, on a\r\n   sufficiently large scale to show the actual value of the\r\n   treatment, while the results appear to afford satisfactory proof\r\n   that the inoculations, when properly carried out, afford an\r\n   immunity equal to or greater than that obtained by a person who\r\n   has undergone an attack of the disease; further, the operation\r\n   is one which does not cause any risk to health. In these\r\n   circumstances, we are very strongly of opinion that a more\r\n   extended trial should be made of the treatment; and we trust\r\n   that your Lordship will permit us to approve the inoculation, at\r\n   the public expense, of all British officers and soldiers who may\r\n   voluntarily submit themselves to the operation.\"\r\n\r\nOn 1st August, the Secretary of State for India announced in\r\nParliament that this treatment, at the public expense, had been\r\nsanctioned.\r\n\r\nOn 20th January 1900, Professor Wright published in the _British\r\nMedical Journal_ an account of these 1898-99 inoculations in India.\r\n\"They were undertaken under conditions which were very far from ideal.\r\nIn particular, there is reason to suppose that the results obtained\r\nmay have been unfavourably influenced by a weakening of the vaccine,\r\nbrought about by repeated re-sterilisation.\" In no case was\r\nreinoculation done. The statistics were compiled from information\r\nfurnished by officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps actually in\r\ncharge of troops in the various stations; and were supplemented by\r\nreports received from the commanding officers of the various\r\ninoculated regiments. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +------------------+------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Numbers under     |Cases.|Deaths.|Percentage|Percentage|\r\n    |Observation.      |      |       |of Cases. |of Deaths.|\r\n    +------------------+------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Inoculated    2835|  27  |   5   |   0.95   |   0.2    |\r\n    |Uninoculated  8460| 213  |  23   |   2.5    |   0.34   |\r\n    +------------------+------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nIf the inoculated had been attacked equally with the uninoculated\r\nthroughout the period of observation, they would have had 71 cases\r\ninstead of 27.\r\n\r\nThese inoculations belong to the early part of 1899. During the rest\r\nof the year, inoculations were made in India, Egypt, and Malta: the\r\nresults are given in an appendix to the Report of the Royal Army\r\nMedical Department, 1899. (See _British Medical Journal_, 21st\r\nSeptember 1901.) The great majority of the troops tabulated were in\r\nIndia. Of the troops stationed at Malta, 61 were inoculated, 2456 not\r\ninoculated; among the former there were no cases, among the latter\r\nthere were 17 cases and 5 deaths. In Egypt, of 4835 troops, 461 were\r\ninoculated; among these there were no cases, among the uninoculated\r\nthere were 30 cases and 7 deaths. In India, of 30,353 troops, 4502\r\nwere inoculated, leaving 25,851 not inoculated; among the inoculated\r\nthere were 44 cases and 9 deaths, among the non-inoculated 657 cases\r\nand 146 deaths. Taking the Indian statistics, and estimating\r\npercentage to strength, we find, amongst the inoculated, admissions\r\n0.98, deaths 0.2; amongst the non-inoculated, admissions 2.5, deaths\r\n0.56. The cases which occurred amongst the inoculated men were in the\r\nmajority of instances of a mild character. Taking Malta, Egypt, and\r\nIndia together, it appears that the inoculated, if they had suffered\r\nequally with the non-inoculated, would have had 108 cases and 24\r\ndeaths, instead of 44 cases and 9 deaths.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1899, this treatment, only just out of the hands of\r\nscience, was suddenly demanded for the protection of a huge army at\r\nwar in a country saturated with typhoid. Still, the South African\r\nresults, and other results during 1899 to 1901, show a good balance of\r\nlives saved. The following paragraphs give all results published from\r\nthe beginning of 1900 to May 1902. They are put in order of\r\npublication. Doubtless a few other reports have been overlooked in\r\ncompilation; but the list includes all that were easily accessible.\r\n\r\n1. _Manchester, England._ The _British Medical Journal_, 28th April\r\n1900, contains a note by Dr. Marsden, Medical Superintendent of the\r\nMonsall Fever Hospital, Manchester, on the inoculation of 14 out of 22\r\nnurses engaged in nursing typhoid patients. Of the remaining 8, 4 had\r\nalready had typhoid. The inoculations were made in October 1899. The\r\nfollowing table shows the subsequent freedom from typhoid of the\r\nnursing staff:--\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n    |             Year.             |    Number of    | Cases among  |\r\n    |                               |Typhoid Patients.|Nursing Staff.|\r\n    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n    |             1895              |       229       |      3       |\r\n    |             1896              |       238       |      3       |\r\n    |             1897              |       302       |      4       |\r\n    |             1898              |       426       |      8       |\r\n    |   To end of September 1899    |       163       |      5       |\r\n    |From October 1899 to March 1900|       146       |      0       |\r\n    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n2. _Ladysmith, South Africa._ The _Lancet_, 14th July 1900, contains a\r\nshort note by Professor Wright, on the distribution of typhoid among\r\nthe officers and men of the military garrison, during the siege of\r\nLadysmith. The figures are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +-------------+-------+------+----------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |             |Number.|No. of|Proportion|No. of |Proportion|  Case-   |\r\n    |             |       |Cases.|of Cases. |Deaths.|of Deaths.|mortality.|\r\n    +-------------+-------+------+----------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Not          |       |      |          |       |          |          |\r\n    |  inoculated |10,529 | 1489 |1 in 7.07 |  329  | 1 in 32  |1 in 4.52 |\r\n    |Inoculated   | 1,705 |   35 |1 in 48.7 |    8  | 1 in 213 |1 in 4.4  |\r\n    +-------------+-------+------+----------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe wide difference between the two groups, as regards the incidence\r\nof the disease, is well marked; but the case-mortality is practically\r\nthe same in each group. (The statistics of the General Hospital,\r\nLadysmith, also tell in favour of the preventive treatment: see\r\nSurgeon-Major Westcott's letter, _British Medical Journal_, 20th July\r\n1901, in answer to Dr. Melville's letter, _British Medical Journal_,\r\n20th April 1901.)\r\n\r\n3. _The Portland Hospital: Modder River and Bloemfontein_. The\r\n_British Medical Journal_, 10th November 1900, contains an account by\r\nDr. Tooth of the cases of typhoid in this hospital. Concerning the\r\npreventive treatment, he says: \"The experience of my colleague Dr.\r\nCalverley and myself may be of interest, though we fear that the\r\nnumbers are too few for safe generalisation.\r\n\r\n\"_Personnel of the Portland Hospital._ We take first the relation of\r\ndisease and inoculation among the _personnel_ of the hospital.\r\nTwenty-four non-commissioned officers, orderlies, and servants of the\r\nPortland Hospital, and 4 of the medical staff, were inoculated on the\r\nvoyage out. All these showed the local symptoms at the time; that is,\r\npain, stiffness, and local erythema; 17 also presented well-marked\r\nconstitutional symptoms--general feeling of illness, fever, and\r\nheadache. Of the orderlies, 9 had enteric fever subsequently. Two had\r\nrefused inoculation, and both of these had the disease very severely;\r\nin fact one died. Of the inoculated cases, 5 had the disease lightly,\r\nand 2 fairly severely. One of the sisters had the disease rather\r\nseverely, and she had not been inoculated.\r\n\r\n\"_Officers and men admitted to the Portland Hospital._ We had under\r\ntreatment at the Portland Hospital 231 cases of enteric fever, most of\r\nwhich came under our care at Bloemfontein. We have not included in\r\nthese figures a number of patients who came in convalescent for a\r\nshort time only, and on their way to the base, and who would therefore\r\nappear in the admission and discharge book of the hospital. If we did\r\nso, of course our percentages would be lower. Of these 231 patients,\r\n53 had been inoculated at home or on the voyage out, and of them 3\r\ndied, making a percentage of deaths among the inoculated of 5.6 per\r\ncent.; 178 had not been inoculated, of whom 25 died; that is, a\r\nmortality among the non-inoculated of 14 per cent. The general\r\nmortality in enteric fever with us was 28 deaths out of 231 cases;\r\nthat is, 12.1 per cent., which seems to compare favourably with the\r\nexperience of the London hospitals.\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting to record our experience among the officers taken\r\nseparately. Thirty-three officers were admitted with enteric fever; 21\r\nhad been inoculated; that is, 63.6 per cent.; a much larger percentage\r\nthan among the men. Only one of these officers died, and he had not\r\nbeen inoculated.\r\n\r\n\"These figures are small, but such as they are they are significant,\r\nand they dispose us to look with favour upon inoculation. So also does\r\nour clinical experience with our patients, for among the inoculated\r\nthe disease seemed to run a milder course.\"\r\n\r\n4. _No. 9 General Hospital, Bloemfontein._ The _Medical Chronicle_ for\r\nJanuary 1901 contains an account, by Dr. J. W. Smith, of the work of\r\nthis hospital. He says: \"The general impression amongst the medical\r\nofficers in our hospital was that a single inoculation probably did\r\nnot confer an immunity lasting very long--the lapse of time differing\r\nin individuals--and also that there was a tendency in the cases of\r\nenteric in inoculated patients to abort at the end of ten or fourteen\r\ndays. I should say, however, that a very considerable number of our\r\ndetachment who had been inoculated suffered from enteric, of whom 4 at\r\nleast died. Of the medical staff, the only member of the junior staff\r\nwho had not been inoculated died of enteric.\"\r\n\r\n5. _Scottish National Red Cross Hospital, Kroonstadt._ The _British\r\nMedical Journal_, 12th January 1901, contains an account of the work\r\nof this hospital by Surgeon-Colonel Cayley, Officer in Charge. He\r\nsays: \"The first section of the hospital, consisting of 61\r\npersons--officers, nursing sisters, and establishment--left\r\nSouthampton on 21st April 1900. During the voyage out, all except 4\r\nwere inoculated twice, at an interval of about ten days; 2 were\r\ninoculated once; and 2 (who had had typhoid) were not inoculated.\r\nImmediately we reached the Cape, the hospital was sent up to\r\nKroonstadt in the Orange River Colony, and remained there as a\r\nstationary hospital till the middle of October. During this period\r\nthere were always many cases of enteric under treatment in hospital.\r\nFurther, some of the medical officers and student orderlies had charge\r\nof the Kroonstadt Hotel temporary hospital, which was crowded up with\r\nenteric cases; and the nursing sisters, for three weeks, did duty in\r\nthe military hospitals at Bloemfontein in May and June, when enteric\r\nfever was at its worst. There was not a single case of enteric among\r\nthe _personnel_ of this first section of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\"The second section of the hospital--medical officers, nurses, and\r\nestablishment, 82 in all--left Southampton in May 1900. On board ship\r\nnearly all of them were inoculated, but many of them only once. The\r\nmaterial for inoculation had been on board for some time, and was not\r\nso fresh as in the first instance. Of this second section, 1 nurse had\r\nenteric at Kroonstadt. She was the only one, out of a total of 36\r\nnurses, who suffered from enteric; and she was the only nurse who was\r\nnot inoculated, excepting the 2 who were protected by a previous\r\nattack of enteric. A third section of the hospital, consisting of 4\r\nmedical officers and 16 nurses, went out in July; they were all\r\ninoculated, and none of them had enteric.\r\n\r\n\"Of the second section, 5 orderlies had enteric fever at Kroonstadt,\r\nof whom 2 died. Of these 5, there were 2 inoculated (once) and 3\r\nnon-inoculated. Of the 2 who died, 1 had been once inoculated, the\r\nother had not been inoculated.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Meerut, India._ The _British Medical Journal_, 9th February 1901,\r\ngives a short note by Professor Wright on inoculations in the 15th\r\nHussars. He says: \"Through the kindness of Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nGeorge Luck, commanding the Bengal Army, I am permitted to publish the\r\nfollowing officially compiled statistics, dealing with the effects of\r\nanti-typhoid inoculations in the case of the 15th Hussars:--\r\n\r\n_From 22nd October 1899 to 22nd October 1900._\r\n\r\n    +---------------+---------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n    |               |         |           |      |       |\r\n    |               |Strength.|Inoculated.|Cases.|Deaths.|\r\n    +---------------+---------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n    |Officers       |    22   |    19     |  0   |  0    |\r\n    |N.C.O. and Men |   481   |   317     |  2   |  1    |\r\n    |Women          |    36   |    24     |  0   |  0    |\r\n    +---------------+---------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n\r\n    +---------------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n    |               |Not        |      |       |\r\n    |               |Inoculated.|Cases.|Deaths.|\r\n    +---------------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n    |Officers       |     3     |  0   |  0    |\r\n    |N.C.O. and Men |   164     | 11   |  6    |\r\n    |Women          |    12     |  0   |  0    |\r\n    +---------------+-----------+------+-------+\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that the incidence of enteric in the inoculated\r\nwas represented by 0.55 per cent., and the mortality by 0.27 per\r\ncent.; while the incidence in the uninoculated was 6.14 per cent., and\r\nthe death-rate 3.35 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nIf the inoculated had suffered equally with the uninoculated, they\r\nwould have had 22 cases with 11 deaths, instead of 2 cases with 1\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n7. _The Edinburgh Hospital, South Africa._ The _Scottish Medical and\r\nSurgical Journal_, March 1901, contains an account of the work of the\r\nEdinburgh Hospital, by Dr. Francis Boyd. Of the staff, 58 were\r\ninoculated (27 once, and 31 twice). Among these 58, there were 9\r\ncases of typhoid fever, with I death, in a patient who had old mitral\r\ndisease. \"Our experience has been that, while inoculation appears to\r\nmodify the disease, completely modified attacks are met with in the\r\nuninoculated. Again, very severe attacks, with complications and\r\nrelapse, occur in those who have been inoculated. One cannot from this\r\nconclude that inoculation has been valueless, for had not the patient\r\nbeen inoculated, the attack might have been still more severe.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Egypt and Cyprus._ The _British Medical Journal_, 4th May 1901,\r\ngives a short note by Professor Wright on inoculations during 1901 in\r\nEgypt and Cyprus. He says: \"I am indebted to the kindness of Colonel\r\nW. J. Fawcett, R.A.M.C., Principal Medical Officer in Egypt, for the\r\nfollowing statistics dealing with the incidence of enteric fever, and\r\nthe mortality from the disease, for the year 1900, in the inoculated\r\nand uninoculated among the British troops in Egypt and Cyprus:--\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |             |Average Annual|Cases.|Deaths.|Percentage|Percentage |\r\n    |             |   Strength.  |      |       | of Cases.| of Deaths.|\r\n    |-------------+--------------+------+-------+----------+-----------|\r\n    |Uninoculated |     2669     |  68  |  10   |   2.50   |    0.40   |\r\n    |Inoculated   |      720     |   1  |   1   |   0.14   |    0.14   |\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures testify to a nineteen-fold reduction in the number of\r\nattacks of enteric fever, and to a threefold reduction in the number\r\nof deaths from that disease, among the inoculated.... The only case\r\nwhich occurred among the inoculated was that of a patient admitted to\r\nhospital on the thirty-third day after inoculation. It would seem that\r\nthe disease was in this case contracted before anything in the nature\r\nof protection had been established by the inoculation.\"\r\n\r\n9. _Imperial Yeomanry Hospital, Pretoria._ Dr. Rolleston, Consulting\r\nPhysician to this hospital, writes in the _British Medical Journal_,\r\n5th October 1901: \"Among the _personnel_ of the hospital (17 medical\r\nofficers, 50 nursing sisters, 83 orderlies, etc.), total, 150, there\r\nwere 22 cases of enteric fever, or an incidence of 14.6 per cent. Of\r\nthe 150, 35 were inoculated, and of these, 6, or 17 per cent.,\r\nsuffered from enteric; while, of 115 non-inoculated members of the\r\n_personnel_, 16, or 13.9 per cent., suffered from enteric fever; the\r\npercentage is therefore higher among the inoculated. There were 2\r\ndeaths, both in non-inoculated patients. In 100 cases of enteric fever\r\namong non-commissioned officers and men, taken mainly from\r\nconvalescent patients, only 8 had been previously inoculated; there\r\nwere 3 fatal cases, all among non-inoculated patients. Among 42\r\nofficers who had enteric, no fewer than 19 had been previously\r\ninoculated; 6 of these 19 cases were severe in character, but none\r\nwere fatal; of the 23 non-inoculated cases, 7 were severe, and of\r\nthese 7, 3 ended fatally. The interval between inoculation and the\r\nsubsequent incidence of enteric fever varied between one and\r\ntwenty-one months, but in only four instances was the interval less\r\nthan six months. The average interval between inoculation and the\r\nonset of enteric fever in these 19 cases was thirty-eight weeks.\r\n\r\n\"As far as these scanty figures go, they point to the conclusion (1)\r\nthat anti-typhoid inoculation does not absolutely protect against a\r\nfuture attack of typhoid fever; (2) that when enteric occurs in an\r\ninoculated person, there is, as a rule, an interval of about six\r\nmonths; (3) that inoculation protects against a fatal termination to\r\nthe disease.\"\r\n\r\n10. _Richmond Asylum, Dublin._ The _British Medical_ _Journal_, 26th\r\nOctober 1901, contains a note by Professor Wright on an outbreak of\r\ntyphoid in this asylum during August to December 1900. Inoculations\r\nwere begun on 6th September, by Dr. Cullinan, and by 30th November 511\r\npersons were inoculated. After careful criticism of all doubtful\r\ncases, Professor Wright gives the following figures:--\r\n\r\n   _Comparative Incidence of Typhoid Fever in Inoculated and\r\n   Non-Inoculated, calculated upon the average strength of the\r\n   representative groups during the period intervening between the\r\n   commencement of the inoculations and the termination of the\r\n   epidemic._\r\n\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |              |Average  |Cases. |Deaths.|Percentage|Percentage|\r\n    |              |Strength.|       |       |of Cases. |of Deaths.|\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Uninoculated  |   298   |30(-1?)|   4   |   10.1   |   1.3    |\r\n    |Inoculated    |   339   | 5(+1?)|   1   |    1.3   |   0.3    |\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\"It may be noted,\" he says, \"that the result is in conformity with\r\nthat of all the statistical returns of anti-typhoid inoculation which\r\nhave reached me.\"\r\n\r\n11. _Deelfontein._ The _Lancet_, 18th January 1902, contains a paper\r\nby Dr. Washbourn and Dr. Andrew Elliot, on 262 cases of typhoid fever\r\nin the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital at Deelfontein during the year March\r\n1900 to March 1901. (See Dr. Washbourn's earlier letter, _Brit. Med.\r\nJour._, 16th June 1900.) They say: \"In 211 of our cases, it was\r\ndefinitely recorded whether the patient had been inoculated or not:\r\n186 of these cases had not been inoculated, with 20 deaths, or a\r\nmortality of 10.7 per cent.; 25 had been inoculated, with 4 deaths, or\r\na mortality of 16 per cent. The mortality was thus higher among the\r\ninoculated than among the non-inoculated.\" Of the _personnel_ of the\r\nhospital, there were 59 inoculated, with 4 cases, and 25 not\r\ninoculated, with 4 cases.\r\n\r\n12. _Winburg._ The _Lancet_, 5th April 1902, contains a short note by\r\nProfessor Wright, on the 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment. He says:\r\n\"In view of the dearth of statistics bearing on the incidence of\r\ntyphoid fever in South Africa in inoculated and uninoculated persons\r\nrespectively, the following, for which I am indebted to Lieutenant J.\r\nW. West, R.A.M.C., Winburg, Orange River Colony, may not be entirely\r\nwithout interest. The statistics here in question give the results\r\nobtained in the case of the 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, for\r\nthe six months which have elapsed since their landing in South Africa.\r\nThe figures, which relate to a total strength of 747 men and officers\r\nunder observation, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |              | Number. |Cases. |Deaths.|Percentage|Percentage|\r\n    |              |         |       |       |of Cases. |of Deaths.|\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Uninoculated  |   547   |   23  |   7   |    4.2   | 1 in 3.3 |\r\n    |Inoculated    |   200   |    3  |   0   |    1.5   |     0    |\r\n    +--------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\"The three attacks in the inoculated are reported to have been of\r\nexceptionally mild type, contrasting in a striking manner with the\r\nsevere attacks which occurred in the uninoculated. At the time of\r\nsending in the report, some of the uninoculated patients were 'not yet\r\nout of danger.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertainly, these instances show a good balance of lives saved, not\r\nonly under the adverse conditions of the war, but also in Egypt,\r\nIndia, and the United Kingdom. But the bacteriological work on typhoid\r\nfever has been directed also to the working out of a very different\r\nproblem: and that is the method of diagnosis which is called \"Widal's\r\nreaction.\" The practical uses of this reaction are of the utmost\r\nimportance. It is the outcome of work in different parts of the\r\nworld--by Wright and Semple and Durham in England, Chantemesse and\r\nWidal in France, Pfeiffer and Kolle and Grüber in Germany, and many\r\nmore. The first systematic study of it was made by Durham and\r\nPfeiffer; and Widal's name is especially associated with the\r\napplication of their work to the uses of practice. Admirable accounts\r\nof the whole subject are given by Dr. Cabot in his book, _The\r\nSerum-Diagnosis of Disease_ (Longmans, 1899), and by Mr. Foulerton in\r\nthe _Middlesex Hospital Journal_, October 1899 and July 1901.\r\n\r\nWidal's reaction is surely one of the fairy tales of science. The\r\nbacteriologist works not with anything so gross as a drop of blood,\r\nbut with a drop of blood fifty or more times diluted; one drop of this\r\ndilution is enough for his purpose. Take, for instance, an obscure\r\ncase suspected to be typhoid fever: a drop of blood taken from the\r\nfinger is diluted fifty or more times, that the perfect delicacy of\r\nthe test may be ensured; a drop of this dilution is mixed with a drop\r\nof nutrient fluid containing living typhoid bacilli, and a drop of\r\nthis mixture of blood and bacilli is watched under the microscope:--\r\n\r\n   \"The motility of the bacilli is instantaneously or very quickly\r\n   arrested, and in a few minutes the bacilli begin to aggregate\r\n   together into clumps, and by the end of the half-hour there will\r\n   be very few isolated bacilli visible. In less marked cases, the\r\n   motility of the bacilli does not cease for some minutes; while\r\n   in the least marked ones the motility of the bacilli may never\r\n   be completely arrested, but they are always more or less\r\n   sluggish, while clumping ought to be quite distinct by the end\r\n   of the half-hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this clumping is also plainly visible to the naked eye,\r\nby the subsidence of the agglutinated bacteria to the bottom of the\r\ncontaining vessel: and thus an easy practical mode of diagnosis is\r\nafforded by it.\r\n\r\nAs with typhoid, so with Malta fever, cholera, and some other\r\ninfective diseases. And the unimaginable fineness of this reaction\r\ngoes far beyond the time of the disease. Months, even years, after\r\nrecovery from typhoid, a fiftieth part of a drop of the blood will\r\nstill give Widal's reaction: and it has been obtained in an infant\r\nwhose mother had typhoid before it was born. A drop of dried blood,\r\nfrom a case suspected to be typhoid, may be sent a hundred miles by\r\npost to be tested; and typhoid, like diphtheria, may now be submitted\r\nto the judgment of an expert far away, and the answer telegraphed\r\nback. It would be difficult to exaggerate the practical importance of\r\nthis reaction for the early diagnosis of cases of typhoid fever,\r\nespecially those cases that appear, at the onset, not severe.\r\n\r\nMALTA FEVER\r\n\r\nThe specific organism of Malta fever (Mediterranean fever), the\r\n_bacillus Melitensis_, was discovered in 1887 by Surgeon-Major David\r\nBruce, of the Army Medical Staff. Its nature and action were proved by\r\nthe inoculation of monkeys. The use of Widal's reaction is of great\r\nvalue in this disease:--\r\n\r\n   \"The diagnosis of Malta fever from typhoid is, of course, a\r\n   highly important practical matter. It is exceedingly difficult\r\n   in the early stages.\" (Manson, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\nAs with typhoid, so with Malta fever, Netley led the way to the\r\ndiscovery of an immunising serum. In the course of the work, one of\r\nthe discoverers was by accident infected with the disease:--\r\n\r\n   \"He was indisposed when he went to Maidstone to undertake\r\n   anti-typhoid vaccination, and after fighting against his illness\r\n   for some days, he was obliged to return to Netley on 9th\r\n   October. Examination of blood-serum (Widal's reaction) showed\r\n   that he was suffering from Malta fever. It appears that he had\r\n   scratched his hand with a hypodermic needle on 17th September,\r\n   when immunising a horse for the preparation of serum-protective\r\n   against Malta fever; and his blood, when examined, had a typical\r\n   reaction on the micrococcus of Malta fever in 1000-fold\r\n   dilution. The horse, which has been immunised for Malta fever\r\n   for the last eight months, was immediately bled, and we are\r\n   informed that the patient has now had two injections, each of 30\r\n   cub. cm. of the serum. He is doing well, and it is hoped that\r\n   the attack has been cut short.\" (_British Medical Journal_, 16th\r\n   October 1897.)\r\n\r\nAbout fifty cases had up to September 1899 been treated at Netley\r\n\"with marked benefit: whereas they found that all drug-treatment\r\nfailed, the antitoxin treatment had been generally successful.\"[36] A\r\ngood instance of the value of the serum-treatment of Malta fever is\r\npublished in the _Lancet_, 15th April 1899. For a later account of\r\nthis treatment and of its efficacy, see the _Philadelphia Medical\r\nJournal_, 24th November 1900.\r\n\r\n  [36] For the whole subject, see _Lancet_, 9th September 1899,\r\n  paper by Surgeon-Major Birt and Surgeon-Captain Lamb. Two other\r\n  cases of accidental inoculation occurred at Netley.\r\n\r\nAnother point is noted by Sir Patrick Manson, in his recent Lane\r\nLectures (Constable, 1905). \"For some time back,\" he says, \"a\r\ncommission of experts, working under the direction of the Royal\r\nSociety, has been studying this disease in Malta. The commission has\r\naccumulated much detailed information; but the most important\r\nobservation it has published is the fact that a large percentage of\r\nthe goats in Malta are infected with _Micrococcus melitensis_, and\r\nthat the milk of the infected goats contains the bacterium. May not\r\nthis account for the great prevalence of Mediterranean fever there and\r\nin other places having perhaps a similar milk-supply?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE MOSQUITO: MALARIA, YELLOW FEVER, FILARIASIS\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, it has been proved that the mosquito is an\r\nintermediate host, between man and man, of malaria, yellow fever, and\r\nfilariasis (elephantiasis).[37] Just as the grosser parasites, the\r\ntapeworms, must alternate between man and certain animals, and cannot\r\notherwise go through their own life-changes and reproduce their kind,\r\nso the micro-parasites that are the cause of malaria alternate between\r\nman and the mosquito, having the mosquito as an intermediate host.\r\nThese organisms, once they get into the mosquito, pick out certain\r\nstructures, and there carry out a definite cyclical phase of their\r\nlives, whereby their progeny make their way into the stylets of the\r\nmosquito, and so get back to man, who is their \"definite host.\" Thus,\r\nmalaria is not, strictly speaking, a disease of man; it is one phase\r\nin man of micro-organisms that have another phase in mosquitoes. So\r\nalso with filariasis; the filariæ in man, their ova, and their\r\nembryo-worms, are one phase of filariasis; and the embryo-worms in\r\ncertain structures of the mosquito are another phase. The _plasmodium\r\nmalariæ_ and the _filaria_ are instances of a law of animal life that\r\nholds good also of plant life:--\r\n\r\n   \"All plants and animals possess parasites, and thousands of\r\n   different species of parasites have been closely studied by\r\n   science; we therefore know much about their general ways of\r\n   life. As a rule, a particular species of parasite can live only\r\n   in the particular species of animal in which, by the evolution\r\n   of ages, it has acquired the power of living. It is therefore\r\n   not enough for the parasites of an individual animal--say a\r\n   man--to be able to multiply within that individual, but they\r\n   must also make arrangements, so to speak, for their progeny to\r\n   enter into and infect other individuals of the same species.\r\n   They cannot live for ever in one individual; they must spread in\r\n   some way or other to other individuals.\r\n\r\n   \"The shifts made by parasites to meet this requirement of their\r\n   nature are many and various, and constitute one of the wonders\r\n   of nature. Some scatter their spores and eggs broadcast in the\r\n   soil, water, or air, as it were in the hope that some of them\r\n   will alight by accident on a plant or animal suitable for their\r\n   future growth. Many parasites employ, in various ways, a second\r\n   species of animal as a go-between. Thus, some tapeworms, and the\r\n   worms which cause trichinosis, spend a part of their lives in\r\n   the flesh of swine, and transfer themselves to human beings when\r\n   the latter eat this flesh. To complete the cycle, the parasites\r\n   return to swine from human offal; so that they propagate\r\n   alternately from men to swine, and from swine to men. The\r\n   blood-parasites which cause the deadly tsetse-fly disease among\r\n   cattle in South Africa are transferred from one ox to another on\r\n   the proboscis of the ox-biting or tsetse-fly. The progeny of the\r\n   flukes of sheep enter a kind of snail, which spreads the\r\n   parasites upon grass. The progeny of the guinea-worm of man\r\n   enter a water-flea. The progeny of the parasites which cause\r\n   Texas cattle-fever, and which are very like the malarial\r\n   parasites, live in cattle-ticks, and are transferred by the\r\n   young of these ticks into healthy cattle.\" (Ross, _Malarial\r\n   Fever_, 1902.)\r\n\r\n  [37] For Dr. Graham's experiments at Beyrout, which seem to prove\r\n  that the mosquito can also convey dengue or dandy-fever, see the\r\n  _New York Medical Record_, 8th February 1902.\r\n\r\n1. MALARIA\r\n\r\nThe _plasmodium malariæ_ was discovered by Laveran in 1880, in the\r\nblood of malarial patients. For many years his work stopped there,\r\nbecause it was impossible to find the _plasmodium_ in animals: \"the\r\ndifficulties surrounding the subject were so great that this discovery\r\nseemed to be almost hopeless.\" In 1894, Sir Patrick Manson--who had\r\nproved mosquitoes to be the intermediate host in the case of the\r\nparasitic nematode _filaria_--suggested, as a working theory of\r\nmalaria, that the plasmodium was carried by mosquitoes. This belief,\r\nnot itself new, he made current coin. He observed that there is a\r\nflagellate form of the plasmodium, which only comes into existence\r\nafter the blood has left the body: and he suggested that the flagella\r\nmight develop in the mosquito as an intermediate host, a halfway-house\r\nbetween man and man. Then, in 1895, Ross set to work in India, keeping\r\nand feeding vast numbers of mosquitoes on malarial blood; and for two\r\nyears without any conclusive result. About this time came MacCallum's\r\nobservations, at the Johns Hopkins University, on a parasitic\r\norganism, _halteridium_, closely allied to the plasmodium malariæ; he\r\nshowed that the flagella of the halteridium are organs of\r\nimpregnation, having observed that the non-flagellated form, which he\r\nregarded as the female, after receiving one of the flagella, changed\r\nshape, and became motile. In August 1897, Ross found bodies,\r\ncontaining pigment like that of the malarial parasite, in the outer\r\ncoat of the stomach of one kind of mosquito, the grey or\r\ndapple-winged mosquito, _Anopheles maculipennis_, that had been fed\r\non malarial blood. In February 1898, he was put on special duty under\r\nthe Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, to study\r\nmalaria, and started work again in Calcutta:--\r\n\r\n   \"Arriving there at a non-fever season, he took up the study of\r\n   what may be called 'bird malaria.' In birds, two parasites have\r\n   become well known--(1) the halteridium, (2) the proteosoma of\r\n   Labbé. Both have flagellated forms, and both are closely allied\r\n   to the plasmodium malariæ. Using grey mosquitoes and\r\n   proteosoma-infected birds, Ross showed by a large number of\r\n   observations that it was only from blood containing the\r\n   proteosoma that pigmented cells in the grey mosquito could be\r\n   got; therefore that this cell is derived from the proteosoma,\r\n   and is an evolutionary stage of that parasite. Next, Ross\r\n   proceeded to find out its exact location, and found that it lay\r\n   among the muscular fibres of the wall of the mosquito's stomach.\r\n   It grows large (40-70 micro-millimetres) and protrudes from the\r\n   external surface of the stomach, which under the microscope\r\n   appears as if covered with minute warts.\" (Manson, at Edinburgh\r\n   meeting of British Medical Association, 1898.)\r\n\r\nThese pigmented spherical cells give issue to innumerable swarms of\r\nspindle-shaped bodies, \"germinal rods\"; and in infected mosquitoes\r\nRoss found these rods, in the glands that communicate with the\r\nproboscis. Thus the evidence was complete, that the plasmodium\r\nmalariæ, like many other parasites, has a special intermediate host\r\nfor its intermediate stage of development; and that this host is the\r\ndapple-winged mosquito. It is impossible to over-estimate the infinite\r\ndelicacy and difficulty of Ross's work; for instance, in his \"Abstract\r\nof Recent Experiments with Grey Mosquitoes,\" he says that \"out of 245\r\ngrey mosquitoes fed on birds with proteosoma, 178, or 72 per cent.,\r\ncontained pigmented cells; out of 249 fed on blood containing\r\nhalteridium, immature proteosoma, &c., not one contained a single\r\npigmented cell.\" Another time (April 1898) he counted these\r\npigment-cells under the microscope:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ten mosquitoes fed on the sparrow with numerous proteosoma\r\n   contained 1009 pigmented cells, or an average of 101 each. Ten\r\n   mosquitoes fed on the sparrow with moderate proteosoma contained\r\n   292 pigmented cells, or an average of 29 each. The mosquitoes\r\n   fed on the sparrow with no proteosoma contained no pigmented\r\n   cells.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, he completed the circle of development by infecting healthy\r\nsparrows by causing mosquitoes to bite them.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, there went out a German Commission to German East Africa, a\r\nRoyal Society's Commission to British Central Africa, and an\r\nexpedition from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; in 1900,\r\nanother German Commission, this time to the East Indies, and another\r\nexpedition from the Liverpool School; by July 1901, the Liverpool\r\nSchool was organising its seventh expedition. Italy, of course, has\r\ngiven infinite study to the disease:--\r\n\r\n   \"It has been decided that, in addition to the stations of\r\n   observation and experiment in the provinces of Rome, Milan,\r\n   Cremona, Mantua, Gercara, Foggia, Lecce, others shall be\r\n   established in the provinces of Udine, Verona, Vicenza, Padua,\r\n   Ravenna, Pisa, Basilicata, and Syracuse. Besides epidemiological\r\n   researches, applications on a large scale will be made of\r\n   preventive measures for the protection of the agricultural\r\n   population against the scourge. Another extensive experiment on\r\n   the prophylaxis of malaria will be made on the Emilian\r\n   littoral. Moreover, in all the malarious regions of the Italian\r\n   peninsula the provincial and communal administrations and many\r\n   private persons will co-operate in the application of preventive\r\n   measures. From all this it may be gathered that during the\r\n   summer and autumn the war against malaria will be carried on in\r\n   Italy with great vigour and thoroughness.\" (_British Medical\r\n   Journal_, 6th July 1901.)\r\n\r\nIn India, the work started in 1900 by the Royal Society Commissioners,\r\nand by the Nagpur Conference, has been widely extended; especially by\r\nsuch researches as those of Major Buchanan, I.M.S., Superintendent of\r\nthe Central Jail, Nagpur. The following paragraph, from the report of\r\nthe Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, refers to\r\nMajor Buchanan's published work, _Malarial Fevers and Malarial\r\nParasites in India_:--\r\n\r\n   \"A remarkable note is struck at the outset, in the\r\n   acknowledgment made, by the author, of the capable assistance\r\n   rendered in these researches by several of his Burmese\r\n   prisoners, whom he trained to the use of the microscope, and who\r\n   soon became expert in detecting and distinguishing the various\r\n   kinds of parasites.... Besides a systematic clinical account of\r\n   the different forms of fever and the associated parasites, which\r\n   is the first attempt of the kind in India, there are a summary\r\n   of the facts showing the relation of the seasonal prevalence of\r\n   _Anopheles_ to the incidence of attacks; experiments exhibiting\r\n   the protective effects of mosquito-curtains;\r\n   inoculation-experiments; researches on the blood-parasites of\r\n   birds; and many other points.... Nor can we pause to notice the\r\n   many attempts now being made by health officers and others to\r\n   pursue the methods of prophylaxis indicated; these efforts are\r\n   necessarily in the tentative stage, but, so far, and especially\r\n   where carried out in connection with small communities and\r\n   institutions, they are giving promise of gratifying success.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous experiment made by Dr. Sambon and Dr. Low in 1900, must be\r\nrecalled here:--\r\n\r\n   \"Dr. Luigi Sambon and Dr. G. C. Low, both connected with the\r\n   London School of Tropical Medicine, volunteered to live from\r\n   June till October, that is to say, through what may be called\r\n   the height of the malaria season, in a part of the Campagna near\r\n   Ostia, which is so infested by the disease that no one who\r\n   spends a night there under ordinary conditions escapes the\r\n   effect of the poison. Dr. Sambon, Dr. Low, Signor Terzi, and\r\n   their servants, have now exposed themselves to the pestilential\r\n   influence of this valley of the shadow of death for over two\r\n   months. They live in a mosquito-proof hut; they take no\r\n   quinine or other drug which might be regarded as prophylactic.\r\n   Not one of the experimenting party has the least sign of\r\n   infection.[38]...\r\n\r\n   \"What for practical purposes may be regarded as an experiment of\r\n   the same kind is being conducted in West Africa. Dr. Elliot, a\r\n   member of the Liverpool expedition sent to Nigeria some time ago\r\n   to investigate the subject of malarial fever, has recently\r\n   returned to this country. He reports that the members of the\r\n   expedition have been perfectly well, although they have spent\r\n   four months in some of the most malarious spots. They lived\r\n   practically amongst marshes and other places hitherto supposed\r\n   to be the most deadly. They have not kept the fever off by the\r\n   use of quinine, and they attribute their immunity to the careful\r\n   use of mosquito-nets at night.\" (_British Medical Journal_, 22nd\r\n   September 1900.)\r\n\r\n  [38] Sir Patrick Manson, in the _British Medical Journal_, 29th\r\n  September 1900, gives the following account of this\r\n  experiment:--\"A wooden hut, constructed in England, was shipped to\r\n  Italy and erected in the Roman Campagna, at a spot ascertained by\r\n  Dr. L. Sambon, after careful inquiry, to be intensely malarial,\r\n  where the permanent inhabitants all suffer from malarial cachexia,\r\n  and where the field-labourers, who come from healthy parts of\r\n  Italy to reap the harvest, after a short time all contract fever.\r\n  This fever-haunted spot is in the King of Italy's hunting-ground\r\n  near Ostia, at the mouth of the Tiber. It is waterlogged and\r\n  jungly, and teems with insect life. The only protection employed\r\n  against mosquito-bite and fever by the experimenters who occupied\r\n  this hut was mosquito-netting, wire screens in doors and windows,\r\n  and, by way of extra precaution, mosquito-nets round their beds.\r\n  Not a grain of quinine was taken. They go about the country quite\r\n  freely--always, of course, with an eye on _Anopheles_--during the\r\n  day, but are careful to be indoors from sunset to sunrise. Up to\r\n  21st September, the date of Dr. Sambon's last letter to me, the\r\n  experimenters and their servants had enjoyed perfect health, in\r\n  marked contrast to their neighbours, who were all of them either\r\n  ill with fever, or had suffered malarial attacks.\"\r\n\r\nA similar \"experiment,\" of the utmost importance, was made in 1900 by\r\nProfessor Grassi. It concerned the workmen and their families along\r\nthe Battipaglia-Reggio railway, 104 in all, including 33 children. The\r\ngreat majority of them had suffered from malaria in the preceding\r\nyear; and only 11, including 4 children, had never suffered from it.\r\nPending the arrival of the malarial season, quinine was given to all\r\nwho needed it. The first _Anopheles_ with its salivary glands infected\r\nwas found on 14th June. Twelve days later came a case of malaria\r\noutside the \"zone of experiment,\" in a person who had never had\r\nmalaria before. The twelve days correspond to the incubation-period\r\nafter infection. _Anopheles_ having come, and the malarial season with\r\nhim, the experiment was begun. The houses were carefully protected\r\nwith wire netting, chimneys and all; the _siesta_ was taken under wire\r\nnetting; the workmen, if they were out in the evening or at night,\r\nwore veils and gloves; and _Anopheles_ was to be killed wherever he\r\nwas found. Quinine was altogether given up and forbidden, except for\r\nthree workmen who had escaped or evaded its use before June, and had,\r\nindeed, never before been treated with quinine; one of them, moreover,\r\nhad been sleeping outside the zone of experiment in July. Except these\r\nthree, all the 104 and their doctors remained absolutely free from\r\nmalaria up to 16th September, the date of Professor Grassi's report:--\r\n\r\n   \"Rightly to estimate the value of these facts, it is necessary\r\n   briefly to describe the surroundings of the protected area.\r\n   Towards the north, coming from Battipaglia, three railway\r\n   cottages are situated, at a distance of 1, 2, and 3 kilometres\r\n   respectively. The 25 inhabitants of these cottages, although\r\n   they were put under the tonic and quinine treatment in the\r\n   non-malarial season, all without exception were taken ill with\r\n   malarial fevers, in many cases obstinate.\"\r\n\r\nExperiments of voluntary exposure to bite from an infected mosquito\r\nwere made at or about this time, in London, New York, Italy, and\r\nIndia. The London \"consignment\" of mosquitoes had been allowed to bite\r\na malaria-patient in Rome. The experiment had to be very carefully\r\nplanned:--\r\n\r\n   \"To have sent mosquitoes infected with malignant tertian\r\n   parasites might have endangered the life of the subject of the\r\n   experiment; and quartan-infected insects might have conferred a\r\n   type of disease which, though not endangering life, is extremely\r\n   difficult to eradicate. The cases, therefore, on which the\r\n   experimental insects were fed had to be examples of pure benign\r\n   tertian--a type of case not readily met with in Rome during the\r\n   height of the malarial season; the absolute purity of the\r\n   infection could be ascertained only by repeated and careful\r\n   microscopic examination of the blood of the patient.\" (_British\r\n   Medical Journal_, 29th September 1900.)\r\n\r\nThe mosquitoes were forwarded, through the British Embassy in Rome, to\r\nthe London School of Tropical Medicine. The two brave gentlemen who\r\nlet themselves be bitten by some thirty of the mosquitoes were in due\r\ntime attacked by malaria, and the tertian forms of the parasite were\r\nfound in their blood. Nine months later, one of them had a relapse,\r\nand the parasite was again found in his blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to sum up the wealth of work on malaria published\r\nin 1900-1901. Good accounts of it are in the Transactions of the\r\nSection of Tropical Diseases, at the Annual Meeting of the British\r\nMedical Association (Cheltenham, 1901), and in the Thompson Yates\r\nLaboratories Reports, vol. iii., pt. 2, 1901. Everything had to be\r\nstudied: not only the nature and action of the _plasmodium_ in all its\r\nphases, but also the whole natural history and habits of the\r\n_Anopheles_ of different countries; and, above all, the incidence of\r\nthe disease on natives and on Europeans in China, India, and Africa.\r\nAll that can be done here is to try to indicate the principal lines\r\nfollowed in the present world-wide campaign against malaria. The\r\nfollowing paragraphs are taken mostly from the accounts given by Dr.\r\nChristophers and Dr. Annett, in the Thompson Yates Laboratories\r\nReport, 1901:--\r\n\r\n1. _Elimination of the Infection at its Source._ This is the method\r\nemployed with success by Professor Koch in New Guinea, viz., to search\r\nout all cases of malaria (the concealed ones in particular), and to\r\nrender them harmless by curing them with quinine. At Stephansort, by\r\nthus hunting up all infected cases, and as it were, sterilising them\r\nby the systematic administration of quinine, he was able to achieve a\r\ngreat reduction of the disease in the next malarial season, even\r\nunder adverse conditions. He says, in his report to the German\r\nGovernment: \"The results of our experiment, which has lasted nearly\r\nsix months, have been so uniform and unequivocal that they cannot be\r\nregarded as accidental. We may assume that it is directly owing to the\r\nmeasures we have adopted that malaria here has, in a comparatively\r\nshort time, almost disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nThis method, of course, is applicable only in small communities; and,\r\nwithin these limits, it may become one of the most valuable of all\r\nmethods, being, like the quality of mercy, a blessing both to him who\r\ngives and to him who taketh. But it cannot be practised on a vast\r\nscale. This difficulty is well put by Sir William MacGregor, K.C.M.G.,\r\nGovernor of Lagos, West Africa:--\r\n\r\n   \"In all probability, the day will come before long, when\r\n   newly-appointed officers for places like Lagos will have to\r\n   undergo a test as to whether they can tolerate quinine or not. A\r\n   man that cannot, or a man that will not, take quinine, should\r\n   not be sent to or remain in a malarial country, as he will be\r\n   doing so at the risk of his own life, _and to the danger of\r\n   others_.... The great difficulty is how to extend this treatment\r\n   beyond the service, more particularly to the uneducated masses\r\n   of the natives. It is simply impossible to protect the whole\r\n   population by quinine administered as a prophylactic. In the\r\n   first place, the great mass of natives would not take the\r\n   medicine; and, in the second place, the Government could not\r\n   afford to pay for the 70 tons of quinine a year that would be\r\n   required to give even a daily grain dose to each of 3,000,000 of\r\n   people.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Segregation of Europeans from Natives._ This method is strongly\r\nadvocated by the members of the Nigeria Expedition of the Liverpool\r\nSchool (1900). The distance of removal to half a mile is considered\r\nsufficient: \"Considerable evidence has now been accumulated to prove\r\nthat the distance which is traversed by a mosquito is never very\r\ngreat, and extremely rarely reaches so much as half a mile.\" The\r\narguments in favour of this method of \"segregation\" are of so great\r\ninterest that they must be put here at some length. The drawback is\r\nthat the method cannot be followed everywhere to its logical issue\r\nwithout some risk of giving offence, of seeming to abandon the native,\r\nof damaging commerce, and so forth. But, short of this, much might be\r\ndone for the protection of Europeans in Africa:--\r\n\r\n   \"This method is a corollary of the discovery that native\r\n   children in Africa practically all contain the malaria parasite,\r\n   and are the source from which Europeans derive malaria. Koch\r\n   showed in New Guinea that in most places infection was very\r\n   prevalent in native children, so much so that in some villages\r\n   100 per cent. of those examined contained parasites. He also\r\n   showed that, as the children increased in age, immunity was\r\n   produced, so that in the case of adults a marked immunity was\r\n   present, and malarial infection was absent. The Malaria\r\n   Commission showed, independently, that a condition of universal\r\n   infection existed among the children of tropical Africa,\r\n   associated with an immunity of the adults. This infection in\r\n   children had many remarkable characteristics. The children were\r\n   in apparent health, but often contained large numbers of\r\n   parasites, and a small proportion only of the children failed to\r\n   show some degree of infection.... The Liverpool School\r\n   Expedition found a similar condition of affairs in all parts of\r\n   Nigeria visited by them.\r\n\r\n   \"With a knowledge of the ubiquity of native malaria, the method\r\n   of infection of Europeans becomes abundantly clear. The reputed\r\n   unhealthiness or healthiness of stations is seen at once to be\r\n   dependent on the proximity or non-proximity of native huts. The\r\n   attack of malaria after a tour up-country, the malaria at\r\n   military stations like Prah-su, the abundance of malaria on\r\n   railways, are all explicable when the extraordinary condition of\r\n   universal native infection is appreciated. It is evident that,\r\n   could Europeans avoid the close proximity of native huts, they\r\n   would do away with a very obvious and great source of\r\n   infection.... When it is understood that each of these huts\r\n   certainly contains many children with parasites in their blood,\r\n   and also scores or hundreds of _Anopheles_ to carry the\r\n   infection, then the frequency with which Europeans suffer from\r\n   malaria is scarcely to be wondered at.... The accompanying plan\r\n   is that of a new railway settlement on the Sierra Leone Railway.\r\n   Miles of land free from huts exist along the line, but the close\r\n   neighbourhood of native huts has been selected. At the time of\r\n   building of these quarters, it lay in the power of the engineers\r\n   to have a malaria-free settlement; instead of which, by the\r\n   non-observance of a simple fact, the station is most malarious:\r\n   in this particular instance, much ingenuity has been shown in\r\n   providing each set of European quarters with plenty of malarial\r\n   infection. In towns only is there any difficulty in carrying out\r\n   the principle of segregation. In two instances, however, this\r\n   has been carried out in towns, with the result that the\r\n   segregated communities of Europeans are notoriously the most\r\n   healthy on the West Coast. Even when no scheme of complete\r\n   segregation can be carried out, the principle should always be\r\n   borne in mind, and, whenever opportunity offers, huts should be\r\n   removed, and European houses built in the open.... It is almost\r\n   universally the rule in West Africa to find European houses\r\n   built round by native quarters, a practice which long experience\r\n   in India has taught Europeans to avoid carefully. At Old\r\n   Calabar, many of the factories are almost surrounded, except in\r\n   front, by native habitations; similarly, at Egwanga, the small\r\n   native town is built by the side and back of one of the\r\n   factories. Also at the Niger Company's factory at Lokoja, the\r\n   native houses are very close up to the Company's boundary\r\n   railings. Akassa engineers' quarters may be, again, mentioned as\r\n   an example where the engineering artisans, chiefly natives of\r\n   Lagos, Accra, and Sierra Leone, are housed with their families\r\n   alongside the European house. A large proportion of these native\r\n   children were found by us to contain malarial parasites.\r\n   Similarly also at Asaba, the proximity of the barracks of the\r\n   Hausa soldiers, who have their wives and children with them, is\r\n   a dangerous menace to the officers at the Force House.\r\n\r\n   \"Examples of the opposite condition of affairs might also be\r\n   given. For instance, at Old Calabar, the Government offices and\r\n   Consulate, Vice-Consulate, and medical house, are comparatively\r\n   free from malarial fever; it having been established that the\r\n   natives shall not build on the European side of the creek\r\n   separating the two slopes on which the native town and European\r\n   quarters are built. This creek is at a distance of about half a\r\n   mile from the houses mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain, from these and other instances given by the members of\r\nthe Nigeria Expedition, that a modified sort of \"segregation\" can be\r\neffected in many places, without any injury either to native feelings,\r\nor to politics, or to commerce; and that by such segregation the risk\r\nof malaria among Europeans in Africa would be diminished.\r\n\r\n3. _Protection against Anopheles._ Manson, in his _Tropical Diseases_\r\n(1905), says, \"The question is often asked, Is there any other way by\r\nwhich malaria can be contracted than through a mosquito-bite? For many\r\nreasons, I believe not. It is difficult to prove a negative; but, so\r\nfar, there is no observation capable of bearing investigation that\r\nwould lead us to suppose that malaria can be acquired, under natural\r\nconditions, except by mosquito-bite,\" All authorities are agreed\r\nthat, practically, the fight against malaria and the fight against\r\n_Anopheles_ are one and the same thing; and the experiments by Sambon,\r\nLow, and Grassi, show what can be done, in this war against the\r\nmosquito, by way of defence. But what is practicable in Italy might\r\nnot be generally practicable on the West African coast; as Sir William\r\nMacGregor says of Lagos:--\r\n\r\n   \"It is not likely that in a place like Lagos as good results can\r\n   be obtained from the use of mosquito-proof netting as in Italy.\r\n   One great objection to it here is the serious and highly\r\n   disagreeable way it checks ventilation. This is a difficulty\r\n   that cannot be fully brought home to one in a cold climate. But,\r\n   in a low-lying, hot, and moist locality like Lagos, it comes to\r\n   be a choice of evils, to sit inside the netting stewed and\r\n   suffocated, or to be worried and poisoned by mosquitoes outside.\r\n   The netting is hardly a feasible remedy as regards native\r\n   houses. It is not possible to protect even European quarters\r\n   completely by it. Few officers or others are so occupied that\r\n   they could spend the day in a mosquito-proof room. Certain it is\r\n   that any man that suffers from the singular delusion that\r\n   mosquitoes bite only during the night, would have a speedy cure\r\n   by spending a few days, or even a few hours, in Lagos.\r\n   Operations here (September 1901) are being limited to supplying\r\n   one mosquito-proof room to the quarters of each officer. In this\r\n   he will be able to spend the evening free from mosquitoes if he\r\n   chooses to do so. The European wards of the hospital are\r\n   similarly protected.\"\r\n\r\nThe European in Africa, as Ross says, is generally neglectful of his\r\nhealth; and the \"unhealthiness\" of the African coast is to some extent\r\ndue to the life that men lead there:--\r\n\r\n   \"Let us compare the habits of a European in a business-house in\r\n   Calcutta with the habits of a European in West Africa. In\r\n   Calcutta he sleeps under a punkah or mosquito-net, or both; he\r\n   dresses and breakfasts under a punkah; in the evening he takes\r\n   vigorous exercise, and he dines under a punkah. He wears the\r\n   lightest possible clothing, he lives in a solid, cool, airy\r\n   house, and he obtains very good food; once in five or six years,\r\n   he returns to Europe for leave.... In Africa, the houses are\r\n   frequently very bad; in Freetown, for instance, they are the\r\n   same as the houses of natives, and are mingled with them. The\r\n   Anglo-African seems to imagine that he can live in the tropics\r\n   in the same manner as he lives in England. He seldom uses a\r\n   punkah, except perhaps for an hour at dinner-time, and, not\r\n   seldom, he neglects even the mosquito-net. The food is often, or\r\n   generally, execrable. Owing to the frequent absence of gymkhanas\r\n   and clubs, the exile obtains little suitable exercise.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever risks the old resident may choose to take, the newcomer\r\ncan at least use a proper and efficient mosquito-net at night, and\r\navoid sleeping in a native house, and protect himself in these and the\r\nlike ways against malaria.\r\n\r\n4. _The keeping down of Anopheles._ The breeding places of _Anopheles_\r\nare ponds, swamps, and puddles, roadside ditches, tanks, and cisterns,\r\nold disused canoes, and the like collections of stagnant water: also\r\nthe smaller receptacles that are more generally occupied by _Culex_,\r\nsuch as broken bottles, old tins, pots, and calabashes, and barrels,\r\nwhatever will hold water--all the débris and broken rubbish round huts\r\nor houses. In all these places, _Anopheles'_ eggs or larvæ are found;\r\nand, with practice, it is easy to detect them. Of course, it is not\r\neasy to wage war against the adult mosquito: the work is, _Venienti\r\noccurrere morbo_, to organise gangs of workmen, or of prison labour,\r\nand \"mosquito brigades\"; to clear the ground of cartloads of old\r\nbiscuit-tins, broken gin-bottles, and other dust-heap things, in and\r\naround the place; to cover-in the cisterns, rain-barrels, and wells;\r\nto clean pools and duck-ponds of weed, and stock them with minnows; to\r\nput a film of kerosene to the puddles, or sweep them out, or fill them\r\nup and turf them over; everywhere, to drain, and level, and clean-up\r\nthe surface soil; and everywhere, by these and the like methods, to\r\nbreak the cycle of the life of the _plasmodium malariæ_:--\r\n\r\n   \"Draining and cultivation where the land will repay the\r\n   expenditure, permanent and complete flooding where it will not,\r\n   and such flooding is possible; proper paving of unhealthy towns,\r\n   and the filling-in of stagnant, swampy pools; these--in other\r\n   words, all measures calculated to keep down mosquitoes--are the\r\n   more important things to be striven for in attempting the\r\n   sanitation of malarious districts. In England, in Holland, in\r\n   France, in Algeria, in America, and in many other places,\r\n   enormous tracts of country, which formerly were useless and\r\n   pestilential, have been rendered healthy and productive by such\r\n   means.\" (Manson.)\r\n\r\nAnd, short of such great enterprises as Government works of drainage,\r\nmuch has already been done, in many African towns, and in India, by\r\nthe work of a few men and women: not only by practical sanitary\r\nimprovements, but by insistent teaching and lecturing. For the\r\nadmirable results recently obtained in Ismailia, Algeria, Formosa, and\r\nthe Malay States, see the _Medical Annual_, 1905 and 1906.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] This paper, by Dr. Stephens, gives also the reasons why\r\n  equally good results were not obtained at Mian Mir, Punjab. The\r\n  whole paper is of great interest.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of malaria, it must be added that the\r\ndiscovery and study of the parasite which causes it have cleared up\r\nthe mystery of the specific action of quinine upon the disease. It\r\noperates simply by its germicidal effect upon the microbe. But, beyond\r\nthis, we have now a clue which we never had before to guide us to the\r\nmost advantageous manner of administering the drug.\r\n\r\n2. YELLOW FEVER\r\n\r\nThe specific organism of malaria may become active again and again in\r\nthe blood, causing relapses twenty years or more after the original\r\ninfection. The specific organism of yellow fever expends itself at\r\nonce, in one acute attack; and, if the patient recovers, he is\r\nthenceforth more or less immune against infection. That the\r\ninoculation of the disease, by the application of a single mosquito\r\nrecently contaminated, is calculated to produce a mild or abortive\r\nattack less dangerous than the average attack among the\r\nnon-acclimatised, was known to Finlay, and was confirmed in 1899 by\r\nthe Army Commission of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf the mortality of the disease, Sir Patrick Manson, in 1900, wrote as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n   \"It is better for women and children than for men; better for\r\n   old residents than for newcomers; worst of all for the\r\n   intemperate. According to a table of 293 carefully observed\r\n   cases given by Sternberg, the mean mortality in the whole 293\r\n   cases was 27.7 per cent. This may be taken as a fairly\r\n   representative mortality in yellow fever among the\r\n   unacclimatised, something between 25 and 30 per cent., although\r\n   in some epidemics it has risen as high as 50 or even 80 per\r\n   cent. of those attacked.... Some of these epidemic visitations\r\n   bring a heavy death-bill; thus, in New Orleans, in 1853, 7970\r\n   people died of yellow fever; in 1867, 3093; in Rio, in 1850, it\r\n   claimed 4160 victims; in 1852, 1943; and in 1886, 1397. In\r\n   Havana, the annual mortality from this cause ranges from 500 to\r\n   1600 or over.\"\r\n\r\nThe earlier attempts to reproduce the disease, by inoculation with its\r\nproducts, failed altogether:--\r\n\r\n   \"In 1816, Dr. Chervin, of Point-à-Pitre (Antilles), drank\r\n   repeatedly large quantities of black vomit without feeling the\r\n   least disturbance. Some years before, other North American\r\n   colleagues, Doctors Potter, Firth, Catteral, and Parker, did\r\n   everything possible to inoculate themselves with yellow fever.\r\n   After having uselessly attempted experiments on animals, they\r\n   experimented on themselves, inoculating the black matter at the\r\n   very moment in which the moribund patient rejected it, placing\r\n   this matter in their eyes, or in wounds made in their arms,\r\n   injecting it more than twenty times in various parts of their\r\n   body ... in short, devising every sort of daring means for\r\n   experimentally transmitting yellow fever. All these experiments\r\n   were without result, and in the United States during many years\r\n   it was believed that this terrible malady was non-contagious.\"\r\n   (_British Medical Journal_, 3rd July, 1897.)\r\n\r\nThe history of the subject, from 1812 to 1880, is given by Dr. Finlay\r\nof Havana, in the _New York Medical Record_ (9th February 1901). In\r\n1880, two very important reports on the disease were published; one by\r\na Havana Commission of the National Board of Health of the United\r\nStates, the other by the United States Navy Department. They tended to\r\nshow that yellow fever is a \"germ-disease\"; that it is not wind-borne;\r\nand that there may be some change, outside the body of the patient,\r\nwhereby the virulence of the active principle of the disease is\r\nheightened. From these reports, Dr. Finlay advanced his doctrine that\r\nthe mosquito receives and transmits the germs of the disease:--\r\n\r\n   \"It was upon the above line of reasoning (in these reports),\r\n   that I conceived the idea that the yellow-fever germ must be\r\n   conveyed from the patient to the non-immunes by inoculation, a\r\n   process which could be performed in nature only through the\r\n   agency of some stinging insect whose biological conditions must\r\n   be identical with those which were known to favour the\r\n   transmissibility of the disease.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he inoculated himself and six soldiers with infected\r\nmosquitoes, and obtained, as he had calculated, mild attacks and\r\nsubsequent immunity. During the years 1881-1900 he inoculated by this\r\nmethod 104 persons:--\r\n\r\n   \"In these inoculations, be it remembered, my principal object\r\n   was rather to avoid than to seek the development of a severe\r\n   attack; in point of fact, only seventeen showed any appreciable\r\n   pathogenic effects after their inoculation. I felt sure,\r\n   however, that severe or fatal result might follow an inoculation\r\n   either with several mosquitoes contaminated from severe cases of\r\n   the disease, or from a single insect applied several days or\r\n   weeks after its contamination, having come to this last\r\n   conclusion in view of the facts connected with the _Anne Marie_,\r\n   and the epidemic of Saint Nazaire.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Finlay's discovery that the mosquito can convey yellow fever, and\r\nthat the germ of the disease is more virulent after a prolonged\r\nsojourning in the mosquito, was proved beyond all question by the work\r\nof 1889-1901. But, so far as immunisation is concerned, few people\r\nwould submit themselves to be bitten by an infected mosquito, even\r\nwith perfect assurance that the germs contained in it were of a low\r\ndegree of virulence: the urgent need, therefore, was for an immunising\r\nserum. In 1896, at Flores, Sanarelli discovered the _bacillus\r\nicteroides_; and by October 1897, he had prepared an immunising serum\r\nwhich was able to give a considerable amount of protection to\r\nanimals.[40] Next year (_Annales de l'Institut Pasteur_, May 1898)\r\ncame the news that he had advanced against yellow fever with its own\r\nweapons--_Premières expériences sur l'emploi du sérum curatif et\r\npréventif de la fièvre jaune_. Of the first 8 cases (Rio de Janeiro),\r\n4 recovered. Then came the 22 cases at San Carlos do Pinhal, in\r\nSaint-Paul au Brésil (January 1898), with 16 recoveries, and only 6\r\ndeaths. And it is to be noted that he submitted his method of\r\ntreatment to the utmost test that was possible; he chose the bad\r\ncases, and the country where the fever was most fatal:--\r\n\r\n   \"Chaque cas était choisi de commun accord entre nous, dans le\r\n   but de mettre bien en évidence l'action thérapeutique du sérum,\r\n   _mettant toujours de côté tous les cas qui se présentaient avec\r\n   des symptômes vagues ou attenuès ou en forme légère ou fruste.\r\n   On ne conservait donc que des cas oû, d'après la violence des\r\n   phénomènes d'invasion, on devait considérer comme très peu\r\n   probable une crise spontanée de la maladie_....\"\r\n\r\n  [40] It is not denied here that he made five experiments on human\r\n  beings. See Part IV. chap. ii.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sanarelli was able to show the preventive value of the\r\nserum. At the end of February 1898, yellow fever broke out in the jail\r\nat San Carlos:--\r\n\r\n   \"La première victime fut un condamné, qui vivait avec tous les\r\n   autres dans une salle oû les conditions hygiéniques étaient\r\n   assez mauvaises. Le lendemain, la sentinelle, qui était en\r\n   rapport continuel avec la salle des condamnés, tombait malade.\r\n   Quelques jours après, un autre condamné suivait le sort du\r\n   premier, et bientôt un quatrième cas, mortel aussi, finit par\r\n   signaler la prison comme un nouveau foyer d'infection qui venait\r\n   s'allumer au centre d'un quartier de la ville encore resté\r\n   indemne.\r\n\r\n   \"Si on avait abandonné la chose à elle-même, on aurait vu se\r\n   produire le même spectacle qu'avaient fourni, dans les\r\n   conditions identiques, pendant les dernières épidémies, les\r\n   prisons de Rio-Claro, de Limeira, et d'autres villes de l'État\r\n   de Saint-Paul.\"\r\n\r\nEvery prisoner, except one who had already had the fever, was\r\ntherefore given the preventive treatment. At once the outbreak\r\nstopped; no more cases occurred, though only a weak serum was used,\r\nthough the state of the prison and its occupants was unhealthy, though\r\nthe fever, two months later, was still raging round the prison, in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIn October 1900, the United States Commission on Yellow Fever\r\npublished a preliminary report on 11 cases of mosquito-inoculation. Of\r\nthese, the majority gave a negative result, and were found susceptible\r\nto infection, at a later date, from the blood of a yellow-fever\r\npatient. Two gave a positive result. In the course of these\r\nexperiments, Dr. Lazear, a member of the Commission, died of the\r\ndisease. In February 1901, and again in July, the Commission published\r\nfurther reports, emphasising the fact that the mosquito conveys the\r\ndisease, and denying that the disease can be conveyed in clothing,\r\nbedding, and so forth:--\r\n\r\n   \"Our observations appear to demonstrate that the parasite of\r\n   this disease must undergo a definite cycle of development in\r\n   the body of the mosquito before the latter is capable of\r\n   conveying infection. This period would seem to be not less than\r\n   twelve days.\r\n\r\n   \"We also consider the question of house infection, and are able\r\n   to show that this infection is due to the presence of mosquitoes\r\n   that have previously bitten yellow-fever patients; and that the\r\n   danger of contracting the disease may be avoided in the case of\r\n   non-immune individuals who sleep in this building, by the use of\r\n   a wire screen.\r\n\r\n   \"We also demonstrate, by observations made at this camp (Fort\r\n   Lazear), that clothes and bedding contaminated by contact with\r\n   yellow-fever cases, or by the excreta of these cases, is\r\n   absolutely without effect in conveying the disease.\"\r\n\r\nIn February 1901, Dr. H. E. Durham published an abstract of an\r\n_interim_ report of the Liverpool School Yellow Fever Commission. He\r\nand Dr. Walter Myers, the two Commissioners, had both of them been\r\nattacked by the disease, and Dr. Myers had died of it. The report\r\ngives evidence that the disease is due to a bacillus which is not the\r\n_bacillus icteroides_; and it does not wholly favour the earlier\r\nreport (1900) of the American Commission. A later Commission to New\r\nOrleans, September 1901 to January 1902, reported an extensive series\r\nof investigations, which seem rather to support the belief that the\r\n_bacillus icteroides_ is the cause of the disease. Later still, this\r\nbelief is again denied; and, as in rabies, so in yellow fever, the\r\ngood work has gone on without waiting for the identity of this or that\r\nmicro-organism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmunisation, by the direct use of an infected mosquito, may be\r\ncompared with the old custom of inoculation against smallpox. The use\r\nof Sanarelli's serum-treatment has not gone far. There remains for\r\nconsideration the method of keeping down infection by keeping down\r\n_Culex_.\r\n\r\nThree reports, in 1901-1902, come from Dr. Guitéras (Havana),\r\nSurgeon-Major Gorgas, chief sanitary officer (Havana), and the\r\nCommission at New Orleans. Dr. Guitéras reports that 6 cases of yellow\r\nfever (inoculation) were treated in a large \"mosquito-proof\" building,\r\nwhich also contained cases of other diseases. No prophylaxis was\r\nenforced, save the exclusion of mosquitoes; non-immunes visited the\r\nyellow fever cases, non-immunes nursed them, and most of the\r\nattendants and labourers about the place were non-immunes; but not a\r\nsingle case of infection occurred. The New Orleans Commission reports\r\nthat, of 200 cisterns, &c., examined in the city for the presence of\r\nlarvæ, the larva of _Culex_ (_Stegomyia_) predominated in more than 60\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe report of Surgeon-Major Gorgas is very pleasant reading. For two\r\ncenturies, Cuba had been cursed with yellow fever; then, after the war\r\nwith Spain, America took it over:--\r\n\r\n   \"The army took charge of the health department of Havana, when\r\n   deaths (from all causes) were occurring at the rate of 21,252\r\n   per year. It gives it up, with deaths occurring at the rate of\r\n   5720 per year. It took charge, with smallpox endemic for years.\r\n   It gives it up, with not a case having occurred in the city for\r\n   over eighteen months. It took charge, with yellow fever endemic\r\n   for two centuries--the relentless foe of every foreigner who\r\n   came within Havana's borders, which he could not escape, and\r\n   from whose attack he well knew every fourth man must die. The\r\n   army has stamped out this disease in its greatest stronghold.\"\r\n\r\nMake fair allowance for the wide variation, from year to year, of the\r\nnumber of yellow fever cases in any town within the geographical belt\r\nof the disease; admit that a town may, in the course of nature, have\r\nmany hundred cases in one year, and only half a dozen in another year.\r\nAgain, make fair allowance for all other good influences of the\r\nAmerican occupation of Cuba, beside those that were concerned with the\r\nstamping out of _Culex_; admit that the general death-rate of Havana,\r\nin the last February of Spanish rule (1898), was 82.32 per thousand,\r\nand in February 1901, was 19.32. Still, there is an example here, in\r\nthe 1901 work in Havana, for the world to follow, wherever yellow\r\nfever exists. The following abstract of Surgeon-Major Gorgas' results\r\nwas published in the _Practitioner_, May 1902, by Professor Hewlett,\r\none of the foremost of English bacteriologists:--\r\n\r\n   \"Commencing in February 1901, orders were issued that every\r\n   suspected case of yellow fever should be screened with wire\r\n   gauze at the public expense, so as to render the room or rooms\r\n   mosquito-proof. All mosquitoes in the infected house and in\r\n   contiguous houses were destroyed. After the middle of February,\r\n   100 men were employed in carrying out the destruction of the\r\n   mosquito-larvæ in their breeding places, putting oil in the\r\n   cesspools of all houses, clearing the streams, draining pools,\r\n   and oiling the larger bodies of water. Up to June, quarantine\r\n   was enforced, together with disinfection of the house and\r\n   fomites. After that, however, rigid quarantine of the patient\r\n   was stopped, and disinfection of fabrics and clothing ceased. It\r\n   was merely required that the patient should be reported, his\r\n   house placarded and screened, and a guard placed over each case\r\n   to report how general sick-room sanitation was carried out, to\r\n   see that the screen-door communicating with the screened part of\r\n   the house was kept properly closed, and to see that\r\n   communication with the sick-room was not too free, four or five\r\n   non-immunes only being allowed in. _By the end of September, the\r\n   last focus of the disease had been got rid of, and since then,\r\n   up to the beginning of January, there has not been a single\r\n   case._ Whereas, for the years since 1889, from 1st April to 1st\r\n   December, yellow fever caused an average of 410.54 deaths, with\r\n   a maximum of 1175 for 1896, and a minimum of 79 for 1899, _it\r\n   caused in 1901 5 deaths only. In the months of October and\r\n   November, when the disease has hitherto been exceedingly rife in\r\n   Havana, there has not been a single case. For the first time in\r\n   150 years, Havana has been free from yellow fever._\"\r\n\r\nSir Patrick Manson, lecturing in America, last year, on tropical\r\ndiseases, summed up the work as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Time will not permit--what to you is probably quite\r\n   unnecessary--the recapitulation of the story of the labours of\r\n   Reed and his coadjutors. I cannot pass on, however, to what I\r\n   have to say in connection with this work without a word of\r\n   admiration for the insight, the energy, the skill, the courage,\r\n   and withal the modesty and simplicity of the leader of that\r\n   remarkable band of workers. If any man deserved a monument to\r\n   his memory, it was Reed. If any band of men deserve recognition\r\n   at the hands of their countrymen, it is Reed's colleagues.\r\n\r\n   \"The principal outcome of the labours of these men has been the\r\n   demonstration, first, that the ultra-microscopic germ of yellow\r\n   fever is present in the blood of the patient during the first\r\n   three days of the disease. Second, that the first step in the\r\n   passage of the germ from the sick to the sound is made, under\r\n   natural conditions, in the stegomyia mosquito. And third, that\r\n   after about twelve days and upwards in stegomyia, the yellow\r\n   fever germ, when implanted by the said mosquito into another\r\n   human host, is capable of reproduction, so that at the end of a\r\n   further period of about three days it has established itself\r\n   throughout the blood, is causing the violent reaction, the\r\n   clinical manifestations of which we call yellow fever, and is\r\n   once more in a condition to re-enter the mosquito.\r\n\r\n   \"These are great etiological facts. They are of supreme\r\n   practical and scientific value. Acting on them, the United\r\n   States sanitary authorities expelled yellow fever from Havana.\r\n   Acting on them, they should be able in the future to protect the\r\n   United States themselves from such terrible visitations as in\r\n   the past have swept through some of your cities.\"\r\n\r\n3. FILARIASIS\r\n\r\nThese same lectures contain an admirable account of the life-history\r\nof _Filaria_. It is not necessary here to describe the loathsome\r\ndeformities which occur in the later stages of filariasis. These\r\ndeformities (_elephantiasis_, Barbadoes leg), which may attain\r\ncolossal size, are due to the blocking of the lymphatic vessels with\r\nfilarial worms. Cases of the disease are hardly ever seen in this\r\ncountry; but it is very frequent in some parts of the tropics. _In the\r\nendemic areas_, says Manson, _10 per cent. is not an uncommon\r\nproportion of the population to be found affected with filariasis.\r\nThirty and even 50 per cent. may be affected. In many of the Pacific\r\nIslands--the Samoa group for instance--I believe that even this\r\nproportion is exceeded._\r\n\r\nThat _Culex_ (_fatigans_) can carry the parasite, has been proved past\r\nall doubt. Neither does anybody doubt, that the keeping down of this\r\nmosquito would keep down filariasis. A report of great interest, from\r\nBarbadoes, was published in the _British Medical Journal_ for 14th\r\nJune 1902. It is written by Dr. Low, whose experiment on himself in\r\nthe Campagna has already been noted in this chapter. Dr. Low reports\r\nthat there is no indigenous malaria in the island, and that neither\r\nhe nor Mr. Lefroy could find a single _Anopheles_ larva, though they\r\nhunted diligently in the swamps and other likely places. But\r\nfilariasis is terribly common, and so is _Culex fatigans_. Dr. Low\r\nexamined the night-blood of 600 cases of all kinds in the General\r\nHospital, the Central Almshouse, and elsewhere, and found the\r\nfilaria-embryos in no less than 76 = 12.66 per cent. He caught and\r\ndissected a hundred mosquitoes (_Culex fatigans_) from the wards and\r\ncorridors of the General Hospital, and found that no less than 23 of\r\nthem were infected. If it were not for _Culex_, and for men's\r\nindifference and apathy, filariasis could be kept down all over the\r\nisland:--\r\n\r\n   \"There is a perfect water supply, and people can get their water\r\n   fresh from the standpipes at their doors. Old wells ought to be\r\n   filled up; no water-barrels or tubs should be allowed, or, if\r\n   kept, they should be emptied every week or so. Tanks and\r\n   collections of water in gardens should all be periodically\r\n   treated with kerosene, or be furnished with closely-fitting\r\n   covers to prevent mosquitoes getting in. These methods are\r\n   simple and inexpensive, and each householder should see that\r\n   they are applied in his garden and grounds. The difficulty\r\n   begins when one has to take into account the inability of the\r\n   negro to grasp anything of a hygienic nature. The only way to\r\n   get over this, would be a system of sanitary inspection by a few\r\n   competent men. For individual prophylaxis, mosquito-nets ought\r\n   always to be used; but many, even educated people, still persist\r\n   in sleeping without them; of course, nothing in this line can be\r\n   expected of the native population.\r\n\r\n   \"If such means were adopted for Barbadoes, the presence of\r\n   filarial disease, which at present is quite alarming, could\r\n   easily, with little trouble and expense, be greatly diminished,\r\n   and thus save much suffering, as well as loss of time, hideous\r\n   deformity, and doubtless in not a few instances loss of life.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in a few years, from experiments on mosquitoes, sparrows, and\r\nmen, has come the present plan of campaign against malaria, yellow\r\nfever, and filariasis; that is, against _Anopheles_ and _Culex_. He\r\nwho would know what is being done to check these diseases in Italy,\r\nIndia, China, Africa, and America, must read Prof. Ross' _Malarial\r\nFever, its Cause, Prevention, and Treatment_ (1902), and _Mosquito\r\nBrigades, and how to organise them_ (1902). There has been nothing\r\nlike it since Pasteur died. Far and wide, from Staten Island to Cuba,\r\nfrom Hong Kong to Lagos, the work of keeping down the larvæ of\r\n_Anopheles_ and _Culex_ is going on. _Henceforth we have to reckon not\r\nwith a nameless something, but with a definite parasite, whose\r\nconditions of life are known. Before all things, we must shut off the\r\nsources of the infection._ For centuries, men had believed in\r\nexhalations and miasmata lying all over the land: and, behold, the\r\nagents of malaria are in the puddles round a man's house, and the\r\nagents of yellow fever are in the water-butt and the broken bottles\r\nand old sardine-tins. Science has given the word, and now there are\r\n_Anopheles_ brigades and _Culex_ brigades set going; labourers with\r\nbrooms and rubbish-carts, sweeping out the stagnant pools, draining\r\nthe surface soil, and carrying off the odd receptacles that serve to\r\nhold mosquito eggs and larvæ. The job, like all sanitary jobs, must be\r\nsteady, year in, year out: it must be limited to infected places, a\r\nwhole continent cannot be treated. But there the work is, and will\r\ngrow; and saves, by unskilled labour, and at a trivial expense, those\r\n\"non-acclimatised\" lives that have hitherto been thrown away as\r\nrecklessly as the larvæ that are now swept out of the puddles and\r\nditches round African settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nPARASITIC DISEASES\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters are concerned with bacteriology alone, and with\r\nthose curative or preventive methods of treatment that have come out\r\nof inoculation-experiments on animals. The lives that are saved, or\r\nsafeguarded, by these methods, even in one year, must be many\r\nthousands in each country of the civilised world. And, beside human\r\nlives, there is the protection of sheep and cattle against anthrax,\r\nswine against rouget, horses against tetanus, cattle against\r\nrinderpest. In Cape Colony alone, so far back as 1899, about half a\r\nmillion cattle had received preventive treatment against rinderpest;\r\nand the sum total of human and animal lives saved or safeguarded, in\r\nall parts of the world, must be reckoned in millions by this time.\r\n\r\nThe present chapter, and the next two chapters, are concerned with\r\nmethods that have come out of experiments on animals, but not out of\r\nbacteriology.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the grosser parasites of the human body, tapeworms\r\nand the like, could not be explained or understood without the help of\r\nfeeding-experiments on animals. By this method, and by this alone,\r\ntheir life-history was discovered. They were known to Aristotle and to\r\nHippocrates; but nothing was understood about them. They were never\r\nstudied, for this among other reasons, that men believed in\r\nspontaneous generation; and the presence of lower forms of life\r\ninside human bodies was attributed to the fault of the patient, or the\r\nwork of the devil. Then, at last, Redi (1712), and Swammerdam (1752)\r\nin his _Bibel der Natur_, struck at the doctrine of spontaneous\r\ngeneration, saying that it did not apply to insects; and in 1781\r\nPallas boldly declared that the internal parasites of man came out of\r\neggs, like insects, and not \"of themselves.\" It would be a good theme\r\nfor an essay--_The paralysing effect, on medicine and surgery, of the\r\ndoctrine of spontaneous generation_. Rudolphi (1808) and Bremser\r\n(1819) opposed Pallas; and von Siebold (1835) and Eschricht (1837)\r\nsupported him. Then came the great students of this part of\r\nbiology--Cobbold, Busk, Davaine, van Beneden, Leuckart, Küchenmeister.\r\nIn 1842, Steenstrup had discovered, in certain insects, the\r\nalternation of generations; in 1852, Küchenmeister proved that the\r\ngenerations of internal parasites are similarly alternate. By feeding\r\ncarnivorous animals with \"measly\" meat, he produced tapeworms in them;\r\nand by feeding herbivorous animals with the ova of tapeworms, he made\r\ntheir muscles \"measly.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeding of animals was the only possible way to understand the\r\nbewildering transformations and transmigrations of the thirty or more\r\nentozoa to which flesh is heir. This chapter of pathology makes up in\r\ntragedy what it lacks in romance; for these animal parasites have\r\nkilled whole hosts of people. Take, for instance, the _trichina\r\nspiralis_, a minute worm discovered in 1835 encysted in countless\r\nnumbers in the muscles of the human body; it was studied by Virchow,\r\nLeuckart, and others, by feeding-experiments on animals, and was\r\nproved to come from infected half-cooked ham and pork, and to make\r\nits way from the alimentary canal all over the body. The name of\r\ntrichiniasis or trichina-fever was given to the acute illness that\r\ncame of the sudden dissemination of these myriad parasites into the\r\ntissues. Trichiniasis had killed hundreds of people by a most painful\r\ndeath; outbreaks of it, in Germany and elsewhere, had swept through\r\nvillages like cholera or plague: then Leuckart and Virchow traced it\r\nto its source, and it was stopped there--_Above all things, we must\r\nshut off the sources of the infection_--the butchers' shops were kept\r\nunder sanitary inspection, people were warned against half-cooked ham\r\nand pork, and there was an end of it.\r\n\r\nOr take hydatid disease, which occurs in all parts of the world, and\r\nin some countries (Australia, Iceland) is terribly common. The nature\r\nof this disease--that it is an animal parasite transmissible between\r\nmen and dogs--was proved by feeding-experiments on animals. In\r\nIceland, where men and dogs live crowded together in huts, there is an\r\nappalling number of deaths from hydatid disease; Leuckart, in 1863, of\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n   \"At present, almost the sixth part of all the inhabitants\r\n   annually dying in Iceland fall victims to the echinococcus\r\n   epidemic.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Küchenmeister's experiments in 1852, there was no general\r\nknowledge of the exact pathology of entozoic disease. The advance was\r\nnot made by the experimental method alone; other things helped: but\r\namong them was neither clinical experience, nor what Sir Charles Bell\r\ncalled \"the observation of the just facts of anatomy and of natural\r\nmotions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeside the entozoa, there are also vegetable parasites. Of these, the\r\nmost important is the _streptothrix actinomyces_, the cause of\r\nactinomycosis in man and cattle. Israel, in 1877, gave the first\r\naccurate account of it in man; and Böllinger, the same year, studied\r\nit in cattle. Ponfick, in 1882, recognised the identity of the disease\r\nin man and animals. In 1885, Israel published the collected records of\r\n37 cases in man, tabulated according to the site of the primary\r\ninfection. Boström, about this time, made cultures of the fungus: but\r\nall the earlier attempts at inoculation failed; and it was not till\r\n1891 that Wolff and Israel published their successful inoculations,\r\nand thus completed the evidence that actinomycosis is a parasitic\r\ninfection, a growth of vegetable threads and spores, transmissible\r\nbetween men and animals, and able to keep its vitality outside its\r\nhost; so that men who are employed with cattle, or have the habit of\r\nchewing straws or ears of corn, incur some slight risk of infection.\r\nBefore 1877, the disease was hardly suspected in man, and was not\r\nunderstood in cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nMYXOEDEMA\r\n\r\nOn 4th October 1873, Sir William Gull read a short paper before the\r\nClinical Society of London, \"On a Cretinoid State supervening in Adult\r\nLife in Women.\" This famous first account of myxoedema was based on\r\nfive cases: it is less than five pages long, it does not suggest a\r\nname for the disease, and it says nothing about the thyroid gland.\r\nFour years later (23rd October 1877), Dr. Ord read a paper before the\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Society of London, \"On Myxoedema; a term proposed\r\nto be applied to an essential condition in the 'Cretinoid' Affection\r\noccasionally observed in Middle-aged Women.\" His work had begun so far\r\nback as 1861; and in this 1877 paper he gave not only clinical\r\nobservations, but also pathological and chemical facts; and he noted,\r\nas one among many changes, wasting of the thyroid gland. He also\r\npointed out the close resemblance between cases of myxoedema and cases\r\nof sporadic cretinism.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, Reverdin stated before the Medical Society of Geneva that\r\nsigns like those of myxoedema had been observed in some cases of\r\nremoval of the thyroid gland on account of disease (goître). In April\r\n1883, Kocher of Berne read a paper on this subject, before the\r\nCongress of German Surgeons; but he attributed this myxoedema after\r\nremoval of the gland (cachexia strumipriva) not directly to the loss\r\nof thyroid-tissue, but rather to some sort of interference with free\r\nrespiration, due to operation. On 23rd November, Sir Felix Semon\r\nbrought the subject again before the Clinical Society; and on 14th\r\nDecember 1883, the Society appointed a Committee of Investigation to\r\nstudy the whole question.\r\n\r\nTheir report, 215 pages long, with tabulated records of 119 cases of\r\nmyxoedema, was published in 1888. It is a monument of good work,\r\nhistorical, clinical, pathological, chemical, and experimental. Twenty\r\nyears ago, the purpose of the thyroid gland was unknown: a few\r\nexperiments had been made on it, by Sir Astley Cooper and others, and\r\nhad failed; and Claude Bernard, in his _Physiologie Opératoire_\r\n(published in 1879, soon after his death), makes it clear that nothing\r\nwas known in his time about it. He is emphasising the fact that\r\nanatomy cannot make the discoveries of physiology:--\r\n\r\n   \"The descriptive anatomy, and the microscopic characters, of the\r\n   thyroid gland, the facts about its blood-vessels and its\r\n   lymphatics--are not all these as well known in the thyroid gland\r\n   as in other organs? Is not the same thing true of the thymus\r\n   gland, and the suprarenal capsules? _Yet we know absolutely\r\n   nothing about the functions of these organs--we have not so much\r\n   as an idea what use and importance they may possess--because\r\n   experiments have told us nothing about them_; and anatomy, left\r\n   to itself, is absolutely silent on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 1882-83, things stood at this point--that the removal of\r\na diseased thyroid gland had been followed, in some cases, by a train\r\nof symptoms such as Sir William Gull had recorded in 1873. Would the\r\nsame symptoms follow removal of the healthy gland? The answer was\r\ngiven by Sir Victor Horsley's experiments, begun in 1884. He was\r\nable, by removal of the gland, to produce in monkeys a chronic\r\nmyxoedema, a cretinoid state, the facsimile of the disease in man: the\r\nsame symptoms, course, tissue-changes, the same physical and mental\r\nhebetude, the same alterations of the excretions, the temperature, and\r\nthe voice. It was now past doubt that myxoedema was due to want of\r\nthyroid-tissue, and to that alone; and that \"cachexia strumipriva\" was\r\ndue to the loss, by operation, of such remnants of the gland as had\r\nnot been rendered useless by disease.\r\n\r\nThe advance had still to be made from pathology to treatment. Here, so\r\nfar as England is concerned, honour is again due to Sir Victor\r\nHorsley. On 8th February 1890, he published the suggestion that\r\nthyroid-tissue, from an animal just killed, should be transplanted\r\nbeneath the skin of a myxoedematous patient:--\r\n\r\n   \"The justification of this procedure rested on the remarkable\r\n   experiments of Schiff and von Eisselsberg. I only became aware\r\n   in April 1890, that this proposal had been in fact forestalled\r\n   in 1889 by Dr. Bircher, in Aarau. (The date of Dr. Bircher's\r\n   operation was 16th January 1889.) Kocher had tried to do the\r\n   same thing in 1883, but the graft was soon absorbed; but early\r\n   in 1889 he tried it again, in five cases, and one greatly\r\n   improved.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of this treatment, by transplantation of living\r\nthyroid-tissue, must be judged by the fact that in 1888 no practical\r\nuse had yet been made of the scientific work that had been done. The\r\nClinical Society's Report, published that year, gives but half a page\r\nto treatment, of the old-fashioned sort; and not a word of hope.\r\n\r\nThen, at last, in 1891, came Dr. George Murray's paper in the _British\r\nMedical Journal_, \"Note on the Treatment of Myxoedema by Hypodermic\r\nInjections of an Extract of the Thyroid Gland of a Sheep.\" Later,\r\nhypodermic injections of thyroid-extract gave way to sandwiches, made\r\nwith thyroid gland (Dr. Hector Mackenzie, and Dr. Fox of Plymouth),\r\nand these in their turn were eclipsed by tabloids.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange sequence, from 1873 onward: clinical observation,\r\n_post-mortem_ work, calamities of surgery, experimental physiology,\r\ntransplantation, hypodermic injections, sandwiches, and tabloids. And\r\nfar more has been achieved than the cure of myxoedema. Even if the\r\ndiscovery stopped here, it would still be a miracle that little\r\nbottles of tabloids should bring men and women back from myxoedema to\r\nwhat they were before they became thick-witted, slow, changed almost\r\npast recognition, drifting toward idiocy. But it does not stop here.\r\nThe same treatment has given good results in countless cases of\r\nsporadic cretinism, restoring growth of body and of mind to children\r\nthat were hopelessly imbecile. It is of great value also for certain\r\ndiseases of the skin. Moreover, physiology has gained knowledge of the\r\npurpose of the thyroid gland, and a clearer insight into the facts\r\nrelating to internal secretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF DRUGS\r\n\r\nLong after the Renaissance, the practice of medicine was still under\r\nthe influence of magic. Whatever things were rare and precious were\r\nheld to be good against disease--gold, amber, coral, pearls, and the\r\ndust of mummies; whatever took strange forms of life--toads,\r\nearthworms, and the like; whatever looked like the disease, after the\r\ndoctrine of signatures--pulmonaria for the lungs, because the spots on\r\nits leaves were like tubercle, a kidney-shaped fruit for the kidneys,\r\na heart-shaped fruit for the heart, and yellow carrots for the yellow\r\njaundice. Among the drugs in the 1618 Pharmacopoeia are _cranium\r\nhumanum_, _mandibula lucii_, _nidus hirundinum_, _sericum crudum_,\r\n_linum vivum_, and _pilus salamandræ_. In the Pharmacopoeia of 1667\r\nare _exuviæ serpentis_, _telæ aranearum_, _saliva jejuni_, _cranium\r\nhominis violentâ morte extincti_, and worse obscenities.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of this Pharmacopoeia, on 14th February\r\n1685, King Charles II. died; and in the Library of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries there is a manuscript account in Latin, by Dr. Scarbrugh,\r\nhow the case was treated. The King had sixteen physicians, and nine\r\nconsultations in five days; and to say \"everything was done that was\r\npossible\" gives no idea of the vigour of the treatment. Finally, the\r\nday he died, they gave him, eleven of them in consultation--_totus\r\nmedicorum chorus ab omni spe destitutus_--they gave him, as _more\r\ngenerous cardiacs_, the _lapis Goæ_, and the _Bezoar-stone_. The\r\n_lapis Goæ_ was a dust of topaz, jacinth, sapphire, ruby, pearl,\r\nemerald, bezoar, coral, musk, ambergris, and gold, all made into a\r\npill and polished; and the _bezoar_ is a calculus found in the\r\nintestines of herbivorous animals. Half a century later, the\r\nPharmacopoeia of 1721 still included ants' eggs, teeth, _lapis\r\nnephriticus_, and other horrors; and in the Pharmacopoeia of 1746,\r\nthough the dust of Egyptian mummies was ruled out, vipers and\r\nwood-lice were retained.\r\n\r\nCertainly these \"last enchantments of the Middle Ages\" were slow to\r\ndepart. Clinical observation, anatomy, and pathology, had all failed\r\nto bring about a right understanding of the actions of drugs. It was\r\nthe physiologists, not the doctors, who first formulated the exact use\r\nof drugs; it was Bichat, Magendie, and Claude Bernard. That is the\r\nwhole meaning of Magendie's work on the upas-poison and on strychnine,\r\nand Claude Bernard's work on curari and digitalis. Of these four\r\nsubstances, two only are of any use in practice; yet Magendie's study\r\nof strychnine[41] was of immeasurable value, not so much because it\r\ngave the doctors a \"more generous cardiac,\" though that was a great\r\ngift, but because it revealed the _selective_ action of drugs.\r\nContrast his account of strychnine with Ambroise Paré's story how they\r\ntested the bezoar-stone on the thief instead of hanging him; contrast\r\nBernard's chapter on curari with Dr. Scarbrugh's notes on the King's\r\ndeath, with all the Crown jewels inside him: you are in two different\r\nworlds. The _selective_ action of drugs--the affinity between\r\nstrychnine and the central nerve-cells, between curari and the\r\nterminal filaments of the motor nerves--that was the revolutionary\r\nteaching of science: and it came, not by experience, but by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n  [41] For a full statement of the great value of this study of\r\n  strychnine, see Cl. Bernard, _Leçons de Physiologie Opératoire_,\r\n  1879, p. 89.\r\n\r\nTake Professor Fraser's address on \"The Action of Remedies, and the\r\nExperimental Method\" at the International Medical Congress in London,\r\n1881:--\r\n\r\n   \"The introduction of this method is due to Bichat; and, by its\r\n   subsequent application by Magendie, pharmacology was originated\r\n   as the science we now recognise. Bichat represents a transition\r\n   state, in which metaphysical conceptions were mingled with the\r\n   results of experience. Magendie more clearly recognised the\r\n   danger of adopting theories, in the existing imperfections of\r\n   knowledge; and devoted himself to the supplementing of these\r\n   imperfections by experiments on living animals. The advantages\r\n   of such experiments he early illustrated by his investigation on\r\n   the upas-poison; and afterwards by a research on the then\r\n   newly-discovered alkaloid, strychnia.... He demonstrated the\r\n   action of this substance upon the spinal cord, by experiments\r\n   upon the lower animals, so thoroughly, that subsequent\r\n   investigations have added but little to his results.\"\r\n\r\nOr take Professor Fraser's account of digitalis:--\r\n\r\n   \"It was introduced as a remedy for dropsy; and, on the\r\n   applications which were made of it for the treatment of that\r\n   disease, a slowing action upon the cardiac movements was\r\n   observed, which led to its acquiring the reputation of a cardiac\r\n   sedative. Numerous observations were made on man by the\r\n   originators of its application, by Dr. Sanders and many other\r\n   physicians, in which special attention was paid to its effects\r\n   upon the circulation; but no further light was thrown upon its\r\n   remarkable properties, with the unimportant exception that in\r\n   some cases it was found to excite the circulation. It was not\r\n   until the experimental method was applied in its investigation,\r\n   in the first instance by Claude Bernard, and subsequently by\r\n   Dybkowsky, Pelikan, Meyer, Boehm, and Schmiedeberg, that the\r\n   true action of digitalis upon the circulation was discovered. It\r\n   was shown that the effects upon the circulation were not in any\r\n   exact sense sedative, but, on the contrary, stimulant and tonic,\r\n   rendering the action of the heart more powerful, and increasing\r\n   the tension in the blood-vessels. The indications for its use in\r\n   disease were thereby revolutionised, and at the same time\r\n   rendered more exact; and the striking benefits which are now\r\n   afforded by the use of this substance in most (cardiac) diseases\r\n   were made available to humanity.\"\r\n\r\nOr take Sir T. Lauder Brunton's account of the action of nitrite of\r\namyl in angina pectoris:--\r\n\r\n   \"The action of nitrite of amyl in causing flushing was first\r\n   observed by Guthrie, and Sir B. W. Richardson recommended it as\r\n   a remedy in spasmodic conditions, from the power he thought it\r\n   to possess of paralysing motor nerves. In the spring of 1867 I\r\n   had opportunities of constantly observing a patient who suffered\r\n   from angina pectoris, and of obtaining from him numerous\r\n   sphygmographic tracings, both during the attack and during the\r\n   interval. These showed that during the attack the pulse became\r\n   quicker, the blood-pressure rose, and the arterioles\r\n   contracted.... It seemed probable that the great rise in tension\r\n   was the cause of the pain, and it occurred to me that if it was\r\n   possible to diminish the tension by drugs instead of by\r\n   bleeding, the pain would be removed.\r\n\r\n   \"I knew from unpublished experiments on animals by Dr. A. Gamgee\r\n   that nitrite of amyl had this power, and therefore tried it on\r\n   the patient. My expectations were perfectly answered. The pain\r\n   usually disappeared in three-quarters of a minute after the\r\n   inhalation began, and at the same time the pulse became slower\r\n   and much fuller, and the tension diminished.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it would be easy to lengthen out the list. Aconite,\r\nadrenalin, belladonna, calcium chloride, colchicum, cocain, chloral,\r\nergot, morphia, salicylic acid, strophanthus, the chief diuretics, the\r\nchief diaphoretics--all these drugs, and many more, have been studied\r\nand learned by experiments on animals. Then comes the answer, that\r\ndrugs act differently on animals and on men. The few instances, that\r\ngive a wise air to this foolish answer, were known long ago to\r\neverybody: they do not so much as touch the facts of daily practice:--\r\n\r\n   \"The action of drugs on man differs from that on the lower\r\n   animals chiefly in respect to the brain, which is so much more\r\n   greatly developed in man. Where the structure of an organ or\r\n   tissue is nearly the same in man and in the lower animals, the\r\n   action of drugs upon it is similar. Thus we find that carbonic\r\n   oxide, and nitrites, produce similar changes in the blood of\r\n   frogs, dogs, and man, that curare paralyses the motor nerves,\r\n   alike in them all, and veratria exerts upon the muscles of each\r\n   its peculiar stimulant and paralysing action. Where differences\r\n   exist in the structure of the various organs, we find, as we\r\n   would naturally expect, differences in their reaction to drugs.\r\n   Thus the heart of the frog is simpler than that of dogs or men,\r\n   and less affected by the central nervous system; we consequently\r\n   find that while such a drug as digitalis has a somewhat similar\r\n   action upon the hearts of frogs, dogs, and men, there are\r\n   certain differences between its effect upon the heart of a frog\r\n   and on that of mammals.\r\n\r\n   \"Belladonna offers another example of apparent difference in\r\n   action--a considerable dose of belladonna will produce almost no\r\n   apparent effect upon a rabbit, while a smaller dose in a dog or\r\n   a man would cause the rapidity of the pulse to be nearly\r\n   doubled. Yet in all three--rabbits, dogs, and men--belladonna\r\n   paralyses the power of the vagus over the heart. The difference\r\n   is that in rabbits the vagus normally exerts but little action\r\n   on the heart, and the effect of its paralysis is consequently\r\n   slight or hardly appreciable.\" (Professor Fraser.)\r\n\r\nIt would be strange indeed, if experts who work in micromillimetres\r\nand decimal milligrammes, and study the vanishing-point of microscopic\r\nstructures, and measure and ordain infinitesimal changes in invisible\r\norganisms, were blind to such gross and palpable differences as exist\r\nbetween men and pigeons in their susceptibility to a dose of opium.\r\n\r\nAnæsthetics must be reckoned among the drugs that have been studied on\r\nanimals: but, for the discovery of them, men experimented on\r\nthemselves. The first use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) in surgery\r\nwas 11th December 1844, when Horace Wells, of Connecticut, had it\r\nadministered to himself for the removal of a tooth. The first use of\r\nether was made by Dr. Long, of Athens, Georgia; but he did not publish\r\nthe case, or follow up the work: and the honour of the discovery of\r\nether went to Morton, of Boston, who made repeated experiments, both\r\non animals and on himself. The date when he first rendered himself\r\nabsolutely unconscious for seven or eight minutes, is 30th September\r\n1846; and the first operation under ether was done on 16th October, in\r\nthe Massachusetts General Hospital. The first use of chloroform was\r\n4th November 1847, that famous evening when Simpson, George Keith, and\r\nMatthews Duncan took it together. The whole history of anæsthesia is\r\nto be found in the _Practitioner_, Oct. 1896.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that the men who make experiments on animals\r\nought to make them on themselves. But they do, hundreds of them, and\r\nsuffer for it: Heaven knows the list is long enough--the discoverers\r\nof anæsthesia, Hunter, Garré, Koch, Klein, Moor, Haffkine, Grassi,\r\nBochefontaine, Quesada, Sanarelli, Pettenkofer--these and hosts more,\r\nhere or abroad, have done it, as part of the day's work; and some--by\r\naccidental infection, like Chabry and Villa, or by deliberate\r\nself-inoculation, like Carrion--have been killed:--\r\n\r\n   \"Dr. Angelo Knorr, _Privat-docent_ in the Veterinary School of\r\n   Munich, died on 22nd February from acute glanders, contracted in\r\n   the course of an experimental research on mallein. Helmann, the\r\n   Russian investigator who discovered mallein, himself fell a\r\n   victim to accidental inoculation of the glanders virus. Some\r\n   time afterwards another Russian, Protopopow, died of glanders\r\n   contracted in a French laboratory. An Austrian physician, Dr.\r\n   Koffman-Wellenhof, died of the same disease, contracted in the\r\n   Institute of Hygiene at Vienna. On 17th January of the present\r\n   year Dr. Guiseppe Bosso, of the University of Turin, died of\r\n   infection contracted in the course of cultivations of\r\n   tubercle-bacilli made in his laboratory. Not long before, Dr\r\n   Lola, assistant in the maternity department of the Czech\r\n   University Hospital of Prague, died of tetanus caused by an\r\n   experimental inoculation made on himself. Some fourteen or\r\n   fifteen years ago, a medical student of Lima proved that\r\n   'verruga Peruana' is an infectious disease by inoculating\r\n   himself with it, an act of scientific devotion which cost him\r\n   his life.[42] Besides those who have died, there are many who\r\n   have only escaped with their lives after long and painful\r\n   illness. Professor Kourloff contracted anthrax in a laboratory\r\n   at Munich, and was saved only by vigorous surgery. Dr. Nicolas\r\n   supplied, in his own person, the first example of tetanus\r\n   produced in man by inoculation of the pure toxin of the\r\n   bacillus of Nicolaier.\" (_Brit. Med. Journal_, 18th March 1899.)\r\n\r\n  [42] Daniel Carrion, born 1859 at Cerro de Pasco, proved, by\r\n  self-inoculation, the identity of the two forms of the disease,\r\n  27th August 1885; died of the disease, 5th October. See _Ann. de\r\n  l'Inst. Past._, Sept 1898.\r\n\r\nThis list is seven years old now; it is twice the length by this time.\r\nTyphoid, malaria, yellow fever, have all taken toll of those who study\r\nthem. It is a long record of the men who fell ill, or died, or killed\r\nthemselves over their work; and the deaths of Barisch, Dr. Müller, and\r\nNurse Pecha, from plague at Vienna (October 1898) are another instance\r\nthat there is danger in the constant handling of cultures. But these\r\ndeaths at Vienna were due to the great carelessness of one man. In\r\nlaboratories in all parts of the world there are stored cultures of\r\nall sorts of organisms, yet no harm comes of it. \"More cases of\r\ninfection occur amongst young medical men attending fever cases,\r\nwhether in private practice or hospital wards, in a single month, than\r\nhave occurred in the whole of the laboratories in the world since they\r\nwere established.\" (_British Medical Journal_, 29th October 1898.)\r\nOutside the laboratory, outside the fever hospitals, the risk is\r\nsomething less than a negligible quantity:--\r\n\r\n   \"Apart from plague and cholera, in all the big laboratories\r\n   studies are uninterruptedly pursued, from one end of the year to\r\n   the other, upon anthrax, glanders, influenza, Malta fever,\r\n   various tropical diseases which do not exist at all or are rare\r\n   in the countries where they are being studied. The laboratories\r\n   in question are situated in the largest and most important towns\r\n   of their respective countries; and, within those towns, very\r\n   often in the most fashionable or most populous centres.... On no\r\n   occasion was there even a suspicion aroused of an epidemic\r\n   having been produced by any of the above-mentioned institutes,\r\n   or by those tens of thousands of operations against cholera\r\n   performed in India.\" (Haffkine, _Madras Mail_, 8th December\r\n   1898.)\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSNAKE-VENOM\r\n\r\nThe Report of the 1875 Commission said:--\r\n\r\n   \"It is not possible for us to recommend that the Indian\r\n   Government should be prohibited from pursuing its endeavours to\r\n   discover an antidote for snake-bites; or that, without such an\r\n   effort, your Majesty's Indian subjects should be left to perish\r\n   in large numbers annually from the effects of these poisons.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly it was not possible; and the numbers are large indeed.\r\nDuring 1897, 4227 persons were killed by wild animals in India, and\r\n20,959 by snakes. (_British Medical Journal_, 5th November 1898.)\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Fayrer's name must be put in the highest place of all those\r\nwho have studied the venomous snakes of India.\r\n\r\nSewell, in 1887, showed that animals could be rendered immune, by\r\nrepeated inoculation with minute quantities of rattlesnake-venom, to a\r\ndose seven times as large as would kill an unprotected animal.\r\nKanthack, in 1891, immunised animals in the same way against\r\ncobra-venom. He also made experiments to ascertain whether the\r\nblood-serum of these animals acted as an antidote to the venom. Then\r\ncame the work of Calmette, Fraser, Phisalix, Bertrand, Martin\r\n(Australia), Stephens, and Meyers. Professor Fraser's observations on\r\nthe antidotal properties of the bile are, of course, of the utmost\r\nimportance; not only in preventive medicine, but also in physiology.\r\nThe results obtained by Calmette are a good instance of the fineness\r\nand accuracy of the experimental method. It is to be noted that the\r\nanimals were inoculated with a fine needle, not thrust into cages with\r\nsnakes, as at zoological gardens; and that an animal thus poisoned has\r\na painless death. The different venoms were measured in decimal\r\nmilligrammes, and their potency was estimated according to the\r\nbody-weight of the animal inoculated. As with tetanus, so with\r\nsnake-venom, there must be a standard, or \"unit of toxicity.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The following table gives the relative toxicity, for 1 kilogr.\r\n   of rabbit, of the different venoms that I have tested. To denote\r\n   this toxicity I use terms such as Behring, Roux, and Vaillard\r\n   used for the toxin of tetanus, taking the number of grammes of\r\n   animal killed by one gramme of toxin:--\r\n\r\n    1. Venom of _naja_             0.25 mgr. per kilogr. of rabbit.\r\n\r\n      One gramme of this venom kills 4000 kilogrammes of\r\n      rabbit; it has, therefore, an activity of           4,000,000\r\n\r\n    2. Venom of _hoplocephalus_    0.29 mgr               3,450,000\r\n\r\n    3. Venom of _pseudechis_       1.25 mgr                 800,000\r\n\r\n    4. Venom of _pelias berus_     4.00 mgr                 250,000\r\n\r\n   \"Of course, this estimation of virulence is not absolute; it\r\n   varies considerably according to the species of animal tested.\r\n   Thus the guinea-pig, and still more the rat, are extremely\r\n   sensitive. For instance, 0.15 mgr. of viper-venom is enough to\r\n   kill, in less than 12 hours, 500 grammes of guinea-pig; so that\r\n   the activity of this venom with a guinea-pig is 3,333,000, but\r\n   with a rabbit is not more than 650,000. With more resistant\r\n   animals, the opposite result is obtained; about 10 mgr. of\r\n   cobra-venom are necessary to kill a dog of 6.50 kilogrm. weight;\r\n   but to kill the same weight of rabbit 1.65 mgr. is enough. Thus\r\n   the virulence of this venom with the rabbit is 4,000,000; but\r\n   with the dog not more than 650,000.\"\r\n\r\nBy experiments in test-tubes, Calmette studied these venoms under the\r\ninfluences of heat and various chemical agents. He found how to\r\nattenuate their virulence, and how to diminish the local inflammation\r\nround the point of inoculation; and it was in the course of these\r\ntest-tube experiments and inoculations that he discovered the value of\r\ncalcium hypochlorite as a local application. Working, by various\r\nmethods, with attenuated venoms, he was able to immunise animals:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have come to immunise rabbits against quantities of venom\r\n   that are truly colossal. I have got several, vaccinated more\r\n   than a year ago, which take, without the least discomfort, so\r\n   much as 40 mgr. of venom of _naja tripudians_ at a single\r\n   injection; that is to say, enough to kill 80 rabbits of 2\r\n   kilogr. weight, or 5 dogs.\r\n\r\n   \"Five drops of serum from these rabbits wholly neutralise _in\r\n   vitro_ (in a glass test-tube) the toxicity of 1 mgr. of\r\n   _naja_-venom.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1894 he had found that the serum of an animal, thus immunised by\r\ngraduated doses of one kind of venom, neutralised other kinds of\r\nvenom:--\r\n\r\n   \"If 1 mgr. of cobra-venom, or 4 mgr. of viper-venom, be mixed,\r\n   in a test-tube, with a small quantity of serum from an immunised\r\n   rabbit, and a fresh rabbit be inoculated with this mixture, it\r\n   does not suffer any discomfort. It is not even necessary that\r\n   the serum should come from an animal vaccinated against the same\r\n   sort of venom as that in the mixture. _The serum of a rabbit\r\n   immunised against the venom of the cobra or the viper acts\r\n   indifferently on all the venoms that I have tested._\"\r\n\r\nIn 1894 he had prepared enough serum for the treatment to be tried by\r\nhis own countrymen practising in some of the French colonies. In April\r\n1895, he gave the following account of his work:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have immunised two asses, one having received 220 mgr. of\r\n   _naja_-venom from 25th September to 31st December 1894, and the\r\n   other 160 mgr. from 15th October to 31st December. The serum of\r\n   the first of these two animals has now reached this point, that\r\n   half a cubic centimetre destroys the toxicity of 1 mgr. of\r\n   _naja_-venom. Four cubic centimetres of this serum, injected\r\n   four hours before the inoculation of a dose of venom enough to\r\n   kill twice over, preserve the animal in every case. It is also\r\n   therapeutic, under the conditions that I have already defined;\r\n   that is to say, if you first inoculate a rabbit with such a dose\r\n   of venom as kills the control-animals in three hours, and then,\r\n   an hour after injecting the venom, inject under the skin of the\r\n   abdomen 4 to 5 cubic centimetres of serum, recovery is the rule.\r\n   When you interfere later than this the results are uncertain;\r\n   and in all my experiments the delay of an hour and a half is the\r\n   most that I have been able to reach.\r\n\r\n   \"This antivenomous serum of asses has these same antitoxic\r\n   properties with all kinds of snake-venom; it is equally active\r\n   _in vitro_, preventive, and therapeutic, with the venoms of\r\n   _cerastes_, of _trigonocephalus_, of _crotalus_, and of four\r\n   kinds of Australian snakes that Mr. MacGarvie Smith has sent to\r\n   M. Roux. I am still injecting these two animals with venom, and\r\n   I hope to give to their serum at last a much greater antitoxic\r\n   power.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1896 four successful cases of this treatment in the human subject\r\nwere reported in the _British Medical Journal_. In 1898 Calmette made\r\nthe following statement of his results:--\r\n\r\n   \"It is now nearly two years since the use of my antivenomous\r\n   serum was introduced in India, in Algeria, in Egypt, on the West\r\n   Coast of Africa, in America, in the West Indies, Antilles, &c.\r\n   It has been very often used for men and domestic animals (dogs,\r\n   horses, oxen), and up to now none of those that have received an\r\n   injection of serum have succumbed.... A great number of\r\n   observations have been communicated to me, and not one of them\r\n   refers to a case of failure.\" (_British Medical Journal_, 14th\r\n   May 1898.)\r\n\r\nGood accounts of Fraser's and Calmette's work are given by Dr. Stone\r\nin the _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, 7th April 1898, and by\r\nStaff-Surgeon Andrews, R.N., in the _British Medical Journal_, 9th\r\nSeptember 1899. For other cases see the _Pioneer_, 10th August 1899,\r\nthe _Lancet_, 25th November 1899, and the _British Medical Journal_,\r\n23rd December 1899. In one of these cases, recorded by Dr. Rennie, the\r\npatient was, literally, at the point of death, but recovered after the\r\nserum had been injected. Two cases have also been recorded of\r\ncobra-bite during work in the laboratory: both of them recovered after\r\ninjection. \"Every Government or private dispensary,\" says Surgeon\r\nBeveridge, \"should be supplied with antivenene, which is certainly the\r\nbest remedy for snake-bite available.\" The cases are few at present;\r\nbut it does not appear that the treatment has failed in any case; and,\r\nwith a new remedy of this kind, it is fairly certain that failures\r\nwould be published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom all these instances in physiology, pathology, bacteriology, and\r\ntherapeutics, we come to consider the Act relating to experiments on\r\nanimals in the United Kingdom. Many subjects have been left out; among\r\nthem, the work of the last few years on the suprarenal glands and\r\nadrenalin, and Dr. William Hunter's admirable work on pernicious\r\nanæmia. No attempt has been made to describe the researches of experts\r\nin many countries into the nature of malignant disease, or to guess\r\nwhat may come of the discovery that mice can be immunised against that\r\nform of cancer which occurs in mice and is inoculable from mouse to\r\nmouse. Nothing has been said of the discovery that the African\r\nsleeping-sickness is due to a blood-parasite carried by flies from man\r\nto man. Nothing has been said about those discoveries in bacteriology\r\nthat have not yet been applied to practice, or of the many inventions\r\nof medical and surgical practice that owe only an indirect debt to\r\nexperiments on animals. Artificial respiration, the transfusion of\r\nsaline fluid, the hypodermic administration of drugs, the use of\r\noxygen for inhalation, the torsion of arteries, the grafting of skin,\r\nthe transplantation of bone, the absorbable ligature, the diagnostic\r\nand therapeutic uses of electricity, the rational employment of\r\nblood-letting--all these good methods have been left out of the list;\r\nonly some facts have been presented, those that mark most clearly the\r\nadvance of knowledge and of practice, and stand up even above the rest\r\nof the work. There they will stand, when we are all dead and gone: and\r\nby them, as by landmarks, all further advance will be guided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE ACT RELATING TO EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND\r\nIRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nACT 39 AND 40 VIC. c. 77\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission \"On the Practice of subjecting Live Animals to\r\nExperiments for Scientific Purposes,\" was appointed on 22nd June 1875.\r\nIts members were--Lord Cardwell (chairman), Lord Winmarleigh, Mr. W.\r\nE. Forster, Sir John Karslake, Mr. Huxley, Mr. (Sir John) Erichsen,\r\nand Mr. Hutton. Between 5th July and 30th December, 53 witnesses were\r\nexamined, and 6551 questions were put and answered. The report of the\r\nCommission bears date 8th January 1876, and in that year the present\r\nAct received the Royal Assent.\r\n\r\nThe evidence before the Commission was all, or nearly all, concerned\r\nwith physiology, with the work of Magendie, Claude Bernard, and Sir\r\nCharles Bell, the action of curare, the _Handbook of the Physiological\r\nLaboratory_, the teaching of physiology, and so forth. Very little was\r\nsaid of pathology; and of bacteriology next to nothing. Practically,\r\nphysiology alone came before the Commissioners; and such experiments\r\nin physiology as are now, the youngest of them, more than thirty years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nBacteriology, at the time of the passing of the Act, had hardly made a\r\nbeginning. Therefore the Act made no special provision for\r\ninoculations, injections, and the whole study of immunisation of\r\nanimals and men against disease. Experiments of this kind have to be\r\nscheduled under one of the existing certificates, to bring them under\r\nan Act that was drafted without foreknowledge of them. Certificate A\r\nor Certificate B has to be used for this purpose:--\r\n\r\n   _Certificate A._\r\n\r\n   \"We hereby certify that, in our opinion, insensibility in the\r\n   animal on which any such experiment may be performed cannot be\r\n   produced by anæsthetics without necessarily frustrating the\r\n   object of such experiment.\"\r\n\r\n   _Certificate B._\r\n\r\n   \"We hereby certify that, in our opinion, the killing of the\r\n   animal on which any such experiment is performed before it\r\n   recovers from the influence of the anæsthetic administered to\r\n   it, would necessarily frustrate the object of such experiment.\"\r\n\r\nUnder one or other of these certificates must be scheduled all\r\ninoculations, injections, feeding-experiments, transplantations of\r\nparticles of disease, immunisations, and the like. They must be\r\nscheduled somehow; and that is the only way of doing it. Where the act\r\nof inducing the disease would itself give any pain, if an anæsthetic\r\nwere not administered--as in the subdural inoculation of a rabbit, or\r\nthe intra-peritoneal inoculation of an animal with a particle of\r\ncancerous tissue--there the licensee must hold, together with the\r\nlicense, Certificate B, because the act of inducing the disease is\r\nitself an operation, done under an anæsthetic. If the animal be a dog\r\nor a cat, he must hold Certificates B and EE; if it be a horse, ass,\r\nor mule, Certificates B and F.\r\n\r\nWhere the act of inducing the disease is not itself painful--as in\r\nordinary inoculation, and in feeding-experiments--the licensee must\r\nhold, together with his license, Certificate A, because the animal is\r\nnot anæsthetised. It is not a painful operation; the experiment\r\nconsists not in the act of putting the hypodermic needle under the\r\nanimal's skin, but in the subsequent observation of the course of the\r\ndisease. Take, for instance, the inoculation of a guinea-pig with\r\ntubercle-bacilli: the experiment is the production of tubercle; the\r\nexperiment lasts till the animal is killed and found to be infected;\r\nit is therefore scheduled under Certificate A. Or take the testing, on\r\nan animal, of an antitoxin; the experiment is not the injection, but\r\nthe observation of the result; the animal may not suffer, but the\r\ninjection must still be done under Certificate A. And, if the animal\r\nbe a dog or a cat, the licensee must hold Certificates A and E; or, if\r\nit be a horse, ass, or mule, Certificates A and F.\r\n\r\nThis want of a special certificate for inoculations is an important\r\nmatter, because it has led to the belief that painful operations are\r\nperformed, without anæsthesia, in cases where the only instrument used\r\nis a needle. It is hardly reasonable, for instance, that the\r\ninoculation of a mouse should be scheduled as a painful operation\r\nperformed without anæsthesia. The disease, thus painlessly induced,\r\nmay in many cases be called painless; for instance, snake-venom in the\r\nrat, septicæmia in the mouse, malaria in small birds. In other cases,\r\nthere are such pain and fever as are part of the disease. The form\r\nthat rabies take in rabbits may fairly be called painless.\r\nInoculations not under the skin, but into the anterior chamber of the\r\neye, are very seldom made; they sound cruel, but cocain renders the\r\nsurface of the eye wholly insensitive, and the anterior chamber is so\r\nfar insensitive that a man with blood or pus (_hypopyon_) in the\r\nanterior chamber of the eye may suffer no pain from it. A horse or an\r\nass kept for the giving of an antitoxic serum has a more comfortable\r\nlife than an omnibus horse; and this preparation of the antitoxins,\r\nsince it is not an experiment, but a direct use of animals in the\r\nrecognised service of man, does not require a license or certificates\r\nunder the Act. But the testing of an antitoxin is an experiment, and\r\nmust be made under a license and Certificate A.\r\n\r\nIt is not the business of this book to consider whether the\r\nsensitiveness of a dog, a rabbit, or a guinea-pig can fairly be stated\r\nin terms of the physical and mental sensitiveness of men and women. In\r\nthe world of animals, as in the world of humanity, there are\r\ndifferences of sensitiveness. Anyhow, the pain inflicted on animals\r\nmay in some cases be measured:--\r\n\r\n   \"A guinea-pig that will rest quietly in your hands before you\r\n   commence to inject it, will remain perfectly quiet during the\r\n   introduction of the needle under the skin; and the moment it is\r\n   returned to the cage it resumes its interrupted feeding.\r\n\r\n   \"Arteries, veins, and most of the parts of the viscera, are\r\n   without the sense of touch. We have actual proof of this in what\r\n   takes place when a horse is bled for the purpose of obtaining\r\n   curative serum. With a sharp lance a cut may be made in the skin\r\n   so quickly and easily that the animal does nothing more than\r\n   twitch the skin-muscle of the neck, or give his head a shake,\r\n   whilst of the further proceeding of introducing a hollow needle\r\n   into the vein the animal takes not the slightest notice. Some\r\n   horses, indeed, will stand perfectly quiet during the whole\r\n   operation, munching a carrot, nibbling at a wisp of hay, or\r\n   playing with a button on the vest of the groom standing at its\r\n   head.\r\n\r\n   \"Harrowing details concerning the horrors of trephining rabbits\r\n   for Pasteur's antirabic treatment are frequently supplied for\r\n   popular consumption, but how little real existence any\r\n   suffering in connection with the operation has, may be gathered\r\n   from the fact that if, as a preliminary measure, the skin be\r\n   benumbed with carbolic acid, the whole operation, from making\r\n   the incision through the skin to cutting out the piece of bone\r\n   with a fine trephine and passing a needle under the dura mater,\r\n   may be done without once causing the animal to withdraw its\r\n   attention from the important business of munching a bit of\r\n   cabbage-leaf or a scrap of succulent carrot.\" (Prof. Woodhead,\r\n   _Medical Magazine_, June 1898.)\r\n\r\nIt may be well to put here--(1) the full text of the Act; (2) an\r\naccount of the anæsthetics used for animals; (3) the latest Report of\r\nGovernment Inspectors appointed under the Act.\r\n\r\n1.--AN ACT TO AMEND THE LAW RELATING TO CRUELTY TO ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_15th August 1876_\r\n\r\nWhereas it is expedient to amend the law relating to cruelty to\r\nanimals by extending it to the cases of animals which for medical,\r\nphysiological, or other scientific purposes are subjected when alive\r\nto experiments calculated to inflict pain:\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,\r\nin this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the\r\nsame, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as \"The Cruelty to Animals\r\nAct, 1876.\"\r\n\r\n2. A person shall not perform on a living animal any experiment\r\ncalculated to give pain, except subject to the restrictions imposed by\r\nthis Act. Any person performing or taking part in performing any\r\nexperiment calculated to give pain, in contravention of this Act,\r\nshall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall, if it be\r\nthe first offence, be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds,\r\nand if it be the second or any subsequent offence, be liable, at the\r\ndiscretion of the court by which he is tried, to a penalty not\r\nexceeding one hundred pounds, or to imprisonment for a period not\r\nexceeding three months.\r\n\r\n3. The following restrictions are imposed by this Act with respect to\r\nthe performance on any living animal of an experiment calculated to\r\ngive pain; that is to say,\r\n\r\n   (1.) The experiment must be performed with a view to the\r\n   advancement by new discovery of physiological knowledge or of\r\n   knowledge which will be useful for saving or prolonging life or\r\n   alleviating suffering; and\r\n\r\n   (2.) The experiment must be performed by a person holding such\r\n   license from one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of\r\n   State, in this Act referred to as the Secretary of State, as is\r\n   in this Act mentioned, and in the case of a person holding such\r\n   conditional license as is hereinafter mentioned, or of\r\n   experiments performed for the purpose of instruction in a\r\n   registered place; and\r\n\r\n   (3.) The animal must, during the whole of the experiment, be\r\n   under the influence of some anæsthetic of sufficient power to\r\n   prevent the animal feeling pain; and\r\n\r\n   (4.) The animal must, if the pain is likely to continue after\r\n   the effect of the anæsthetic has ceased, or if any serious\r\n   injury has been inflicted on the animal, be killed before it\r\n   recovers from the influence of the anæsthetic which has been\r\n   administered; and\r\n\r\n   (5.) The experiment shall not be performed as an illustration of\r\n   lectures in medical schools, hospitals, colleges, or elsewhere;\r\n   and\r\n\r\n   (6.) The experiment shall not be performed for the purpose of\r\n   attaining manual skill.\r\n\r\nProvided as follows; that is to say,\r\n\r\n   (1.) Experiments may be performed under the foregoing provisions\r\n   as to the use of anæsthetics by a person giving illustrations of\r\n   lectures in medical schools, hospitals, or colleges, or\r\n   elsewhere, on such certificate being given as in this Act\r\n   mentioned, that the proposed experiments are absolutely\r\n   necessary for the due instruction of the persons to whom such\r\n   lectures are given with a view to their acquiring physiological\r\n   knowledge, or knowledge which will be useful to them for saving\r\n   or prolonging life, or alleviating suffering; and\r\n\r\n   (2.) Experiments may be performed without anæsthetics on such\r\n   certificate being given as in this Act mentioned, that\r\n   insensibility cannot be produced without necessarily frustrating\r\n   the object of such experiments; and\r\n\r\n   (3.) Experiments may be performed without the person who\r\n   performed such experiments being under an obligation to cause\r\n   the animal, on which any such experiment is performed, to be\r\n   killed before it recovers from the influence of the anæsthetic,\r\n   on such certificate being given as in this Act mentioned, that\r\n   the so killing the animal would necessarily frustrate the object\r\n   of the experiment, and provided that the animal be killed as\r\n   soon as such object has been attained; and\r\n\r\n   (4.) Experiments may be performed not directly for the\r\n   advancement by new discovery of physiological knowledge, or of\r\n   knowledge which will be useful for saving or prolonging life, or\r\n   alleviating suffering, but for the purpose of testing a\r\n   particular former discovery alleged to have been made for the\r\n   advancement of such knowledge as last aforesaid, on such\r\n   certificate being given as is in this Act mentioned that such\r\n   testing is absolutely necessary for the effectual advancement of\r\n   such knowledge.\r\n\r\n4. The substance known as urari or curare shall not for the purposes\r\nof this Act be deemed to be an anæsthetic.\r\n\r\n5. Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, an experiment\r\ncalculated to give pain shall not be performed without anæsthetics on\r\na dog or cat, except on such certificate being given as in this Act\r\nmentioned, stating, in addition to the statements hereinbefore\r\nrequired to be made in such certificate, that for reasons specified in\r\nthe certificate the object of the experiment will be necessarily\r\nfrustrated unless it is performed on an animal similar in constitution\r\nand habits to a cat or dog, and no other animal is available for such\r\nexperiment; and an experiment calculated to give pain shall not be\r\nperformed on any horse, ass, or mule except on such certificate being\r\ngiven as in this Act mentioned that the object of the experiment will\r\nbe necessarily frustrated unless it is performed on a horse, ass, or\r\nmule, and that no other animal is available for such experiment.\r\n\r\n6. Any exhibition to the general public, whether admitted on payment\r\nof money or gratuitously, of experiments on living animals calculated\r\nto give pain shall be illegal.\r\n\r\nAny person performing or aiding in performing such experiments shall\r\nbe deemed to be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall, if\r\nit be the first offence, be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty\r\npounds, and if it be the second or any subsequent offence, be liable,\r\nat the discretion of the court by which he is tried, to a penalty not\r\nexceeding one hundred pounds, or to imprisonment for a period not\r\nexceeding three months.\r\n\r\nAnd any person publishing any notice of any such intended exhibition\r\nby advertisement in a newspaper, placard, or otherwise shall be liable\r\nto a penalty not exceeding one pound.\r\n\r\nA person punished for an offence under this section shall not for the\r\nsame offence be punishable under any other section of this Act.\r\n\r\n_Administration of Law_\r\n\r\n7. The Secretary of State may insert, as a condition of granting any\r\nlicense, a provision in such license that the place in which any\r\nexperiment is to be performed by the licensee is to be registered in\r\nsuch manner as the Secretary of State may from time to time by any\r\ngeneral or special order direct; provided that every place for the\r\nperformance of experiments for the purpose of instruction under this\r\nAct shall be approved by the Secretary of State, and shall be\r\nregistered in such manner as he may from time to time by any general\r\nor special order direct.\r\n\r\n8. The Secretary of State may license any person whom he may think\r\nqualified to hold a license to perform experiments under this Act. A\r\nlicense granted by him may be for such time as he may think fit, and\r\nmay be revoked by him on his being satisfied that such license ought\r\nto be revoked. There may be annexed to such license any conditions\r\nwhich the Secretary of State may think expedient for the purpose of\r\nbetter carrying into effect the objects of this Act, but not\r\ninconsistent with the provisions thereof.\r\n\r\n9. The Secretary of State may direct any person performing experiments\r\nunder this Act from time to time to make such reports to him of the\r\nresult of such experiments, in such form and with such details as he\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\n10. The Secretary of State shall cause all registered places to be\r\nfrom time to time visited by inspectors for the purpose of securing a\r\ncompliance with the provisions of this Act, and the Secretary of State\r\nmay, with the assent of the Treasury as to number, appoint any special\r\ninspectors, or may from time to time assign the duties of any such\r\ninspectors to such officers in the employment of the Government, who\r\nmay be willing to accept the same, as he may think fit, either\r\npermanently or temporarily.\r\n\r\n11. Any application for a license under this Act and a certificate\r\ngiven as in this Act mentioned must be signed by one or more of the\r\nfollowing persons; that is to say,\r\n\r\n   The President of the Royal Society;\r\n\r\n   The President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh;\r\n\r\n   The President of Royal Irish Academy;\r\n\r\n   The Presidents of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in London,\r\n   Edinburgh, or Dublin;\r\n\r\n   The Presidents of the Royal Colleges of Physicians in London,\r\n   Edinburgh, or Dublin;\r\n\r\n   The President of the General Medical Council;\r\n\r\n   The President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of\r\n   Glasgow;\r\n\r\n   The President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, or\r\n   the President of the Royal Veterinary College, London, but in\r\n   the case only of an experiment to be performed under anæsthetics\r\n   with a view to the advancement by new discovery of veterinary\r\n   science;\r\n\r\nand also (unless the applicant be a professor of physiology, medicine,\r\nanatomy, medical jurisprudence, materia medica, or surgery in a\r\nuniversity in Great Britain or Ireland, or in University College,\r\nLondon, or in a college in Great Britain or Ireland, incorporated by\r\nroyal charter) by a professor of physiology, medicine, anatomy,\r\nmedical jurisprudence, materia medica, or surgery in a university in\r\nGreat Britain or Ireland, or in University College, London, or in a\r\ncollege in Great Britain or Ireland, incorporated by royal charter.\r\n\r\nProvided that where any person applying for a certificate under this\r\nAct is himself one of the persons authorised to sign such certificate,\r\nthe signature of some other of such persons shall be substituted for\r\nthe signature of the applicant.\r\n\r\nA certificate under this section may be given for such time or for\r\nsuch series of experiments as the person or persons signing the\r\ncertificate may think expedient.\r\n\r\nA copy of any certificate under this section shall be forwarded by the\r\napplicant to the Secretary of State, but shall not be available until\r\none week after a copy has been so forwarded.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State may at any time disallow or suspend any\r\ncertificate given under this section.\r\n\r\n12. The powers conferred by this Act of granting a license or giving a\r\ncertificate for the performance of experiments on living animals may\r\nbe exercised by an order in writing under the hand of any judge of the\r\nHigh Court of Justice in England, of the High Court of Session in\r\nScotland, or of any of the superior courts in Ireland, including any\r\ncourt to which the jurisdiction of such last-mentioned courts may be\r\ntransferred, in a case where such judge is satisfied that it is\r\nessential for the purposes of justice in a criminal case to make any\r\nsuch experiment.\r\n\r\n_Legal Proceedings_\r\n\r\n13. A justice of the peace, on information on oath that there is\r\nreasonable ground to believe that experiments in contravention of this\r\nAct are being performed by an unlicensed person in any place not\r\nregistered under this Act, may issue his warrant authorising any\r\nofficer or constable of police to enter and search such place, and to\r\ntake the names and addresses of the persons found therein.\r\n\r\nAny person who refuses admission on demand to a police officer or\r\nconstable so authorised, or obstructs such officer or constable in the\r\nexecution of his duty under this section, or who refuses on demand to\r\ndisclose his name or address, or gives a false name or address, shall\r\nbe liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds.\r\n\r\n14. In England, offences against this Act may be prosecuted and\r\npenalties under this Act recovered before a court of summary\r\njurisdiction in manner directed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act.\r\n\r\n   In England \"Summary Jurisdiction Act\" means the Act of the\r\n   session of the eleventh and twelfth years of the reign of Her\r\n   present Majesty, chapter forty-three, intituled \"An Act to\r\n   facilitate the performance of the duties of justices of the\r\n   peace out of sessions within England and Wales with respect to\r\n   summary convictions and orders,\" and any Act amending the same.\r\n\r\n   \"Court of summary jurisdiction\" means and includes any justice\r\n   or justices of the peace, metropolitan police magistrate,\r\n   stipendiary or other magistrate, or officer, by whatever name\r\n   called, exercising jurisdiction in pursuance of the Summary\r\n   Jurisdiction Act: Provided that the court when hearing and\r\n   determining an information under this Act shall be constituted\r\n   either of two or more justices of the peace in petty sessions,\r\n   sitting at a place appointed for holding petty sessions, or of\r\n   some magistrate or officer sitting alone or with others at some\r\n   court or other place appointed for the administration of\r\n   justice, and for the time being empowered by law to do alone any\r\n   act authorised to be done by more than one justice of the peace.\r\n\r\n15. In England, where a person is accused before a court of summary\r\njurisdiction of any offence against this Act in respect of which a\r\npenalty of more than five pounds can be imposed, the accused may, on\r\nappearing before the court of summary jurisdiction, declare that he\r\nobjects to being tried for such offence by a court of summary\r\njurisdiction, and thereupon the court of summary jurisdiction may deal\r\nwith the case in all respects as if the accused were charged with an\r\nindictable offence and not an offence punishable on summary\r\nconviction, and the offence may be prosecuted on indictment\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n16. In England, if any party thinks himself aggrieved by any\r\nconviction made by a court of summary jurisdiction on determining any\r\ninformation under this Act, the party so aggrieved may appeal\r\ntherefrom, subject to the conditions and regulations following:---\r\n\r\n   (1.) The appeal shall be made to the next court of general or\r\n   quarter sessions for the county or place in which the cause of\r\n   appeal has arisen, holden not less than twenty-one days after\r\n   the decision of the court from which the appeal is made; and\r\n\r\n   (2.) The appellant shall, within ten days after the cause of\r\n   appeal has arisen, give notice to the other party and to the\r\n   court of summary jurisdiction of his intention to appeal, and of\r\n   the ground thereof; and\r\n\r\n   (3.) The appellant shall, within three days after such notice,\r\n   enter into a recognizance before a justice of the peace, with\r\n   two sufficient sureties, conditioned personally to try such\r\n   appeal, and to abide the judgment of the court thereon, and to\r\n   pay such costs as may be awarded by the court, or give such\r\n   other security by deposit of money or otherwise as the justice\r\n   may allow; and\r\n\r\n   (4.) Where the appellant is in custody the justice may, if he\r\n   think fit, on the appellant entering into such recognizance or\r\n   giving such other security as aforesaid, release him from\r\n   custody; and\r\n\r\n   (5.) The court of appeal may adjourn the appeal, and upon the\r\n   hearing thereof they may confirm, reverse, or modify the\r\n   decision of the court of summary jurisdiction, or remit the\r\n   matter to the court of summary jurisdiction with the opinion of\r\n   the court of appeal thereon, or make such other order in the\r\n   matter as the court thinks just, and if the matter be remitted\r\n   to the court of summary jurisdiction the said last-mentioned\r\n   court shall thereupon re-hear and decide the information in\r\n   accordance with the order of the said court of appeal. The\r\n   court of appeal may also make such order as to costs to be paid\r\n   by either party as the court thinks just.\r\n\r\n17. In Scotland, offences against this Act may be prosecuted and\r\npenalties under this Act recovered under the provisions of the Summary\r\nProcedure Act, 1864, or if a person accused of any offence against\r\nthis Act in respect of which a penalty of more than five pounds can be\r\nimposed, on appearing before a court of summary jurisdiction, declare\r\nthat he objects to being tried for such offence in the court of\r\nsummary jurisdiction, proceedings may be taken against him on\r\nindictment in the Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh or on circuit.\r\n\r\nEvery person found liable in any penalty or costs shall be liable in\r\ndefault of immediate payment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\r\nthree months, or until such penalty or costs are sooner paid.\r\n\r\n18. In Ireland, offences against this Act may be prosecuted and\r\npenalties under this Act recovered in a summary manner, subject and\r\naccording to the provisions with respect to the prosecution of\r\noffences, the recovery of penalties, and to appeal of the Petty\r\nSessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, and any Act amending the same, and in\r\nDublin of the Acts regulating the powers of justices of the peace or\r\nof the police of Dublin metropolis. All penalties recovered under this\r\nAct shall be applied in manner directed by the Fines (Ireland) Act,\r\n1871, and any Act amending the same.\r\n\r\n19. In Ireland, where a person is accused before a court of summary\r\njurisdiction of any offence against this Act in respect of which a\r\npenalty of more than five pounds can be imposed, the accused may, on\r\nappearing before the court of summary jurisdiction, declare that he\r\nobjects to being tried for such offence by a court of summary\r\njurisdiction, and thereupon the court of summary jurisdiction may deal\r\nwith the case in all respects as if the accused were charged with an\r\nindictable offence and not an offence punishable on summary\r\nconviction, and the offence may be prosecuted on indictment\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n20. In the application of this Act to Ireland the term \"the Secretary\r\nof State\" shall be construed to mean the Chief Secretary to the Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland for the time being.\r\n\r\n21. A prosecution under this Act against a licensed person shall not\r\nbe instituted except with the assent in writing of the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\n22. This Act shall not apply to invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--ANÆSTHETICS UNDER THE ACT\r\n\r\nIn almost every case, the anæsthetic used is chloroform or ether;\r\nsometimes it is combined with or followed by morphia or chloral. The\r\nnature of the anæsthetic used in each case must, of course, be stated\r\nin the returns sent to the Home Office.\r\n\r\nOf the use of ether, it need only be said that animals take it well,\r\nand that there is no difficulty in rendering them unconscious with it.\r\nWith some animals, chloroform is equally good. Professor Hobday, of\r\nthe Royal Veterinary College, published in 1898 an account of 500\r\nadministrations of chloroform to dogs, for operations, with only one\r\ndeath. Still, for dogs and cats, ether is used in preference to\r\nchloroform. Other animals take chloroform well.\r\n\r\nMorphia is seldom used alone; but, in some cases, it is used after\r\nchloroform or ether. That morphia is a \"real anæsthetic\" is certain,\r\nfor there are deaths every year from an over-dose of it. Again, it is\r\ncertain that an animal, so far under the influence of morphia that it\r\nlies still, cannot be suffering, for the drug does not act directly\r\non the muscles but on the higher nervous centres.\r\n\r\nVery rarely a dog may fail to come readily under the influence of\r\nmorphia, may be excited by it, not narcotized. But this is altogether\r\nexceptional. An animal in such a condition would not be suited for\r\nexperiment, and another anæsthetic would be given. Except in these\r\nrare cases, animals take morphia well and are profoundly influenced by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCurare is not an anæsthetic under the Act. It is illegal to use it as\r\nan anæsthetic. In this country it is seldom used at all, and it is\r\nnever used alone in any experiment involving any sort or kind of\r\npainful operation. In every such case a recognised anæsthetic must be\r\ngiven, and is given.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] See Part IV., \"Curare.\"\r\n\r\nA good account of curare was published in the _Edinburgh Review_, July\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n   \"The Act of 1876 expressly forbids its use as an anæsthetic.\r\n   When it is used, it must be supplemented with some other drug to\r\n   relieve pain. A good deal of misconception exists as to the\r\n   actual physiological effect of curare. Claude Bernard believed\r\n   that it did not in any way affect the sensory nerves, and he\r\n   described in theatrical terms the animal as being unable to\r\n   stir, but suffering horrible torture. It is pretty certainly\r\n   known now that Claude Bernard was wrong, and that, though curare\r\n   acts first upon the motor nerves, it also, though less rapidly,\r\n   paralyses the sensory nerves.... Probably the truth is, that,\r\n   like all other nerve-poisons, the effect of curare varies with\r\n   the dose. The muscular nerves are the first affected, then the\r\n   sensory, and finally the central nervous system. As a matter of\r\n   fact, however, morphia or some other narcotic is always given in\r\n   addition to curare when it is used in laboratory work in\r\n   England.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--LATEST REPORT (1905) OF INSPECTORS UNDER THE ACT\r\n\r\n(The various tables of names, places, &c., and the references to them,\r\nwhich are contained in this Report, need not be reprinted here. The\r\nReport, and other papers relating to the Act, may be bought for a few\r\npence from Wyman & Sons, Ltd., Fetter Lane, E.C.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n    _April 17th, 1906._\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honour to submit the following Report on Experiments\r\nperformed in England and Scotland during the Year 1905, under the Act\r\n39 & 40 Vict. c. 77.... Six new places were registered for the\r\nperformance of experiments, and one place was removed from the\r\nregister during the year. All licensees were restricted to the\r\nregistered place or places specified on their licenses, with the\r\nexception of those who were permitted to perform inoculation\r\nexperiments in places other than a \"registered place,\" with the object\r\nof studying outbreaks of disease occurring in remote districts or\r\nunder circumstances which render it impracticable to perform the\r\nexperiment in a \"registered place.\"\r\n\r\nThe total number of licensees was 381. Reports have been furnished by\r\n(or, in a few exceptional cases, on behalf of) these licensees in the\r\nform required by the Secretary for State. The reports show that 122\r\nlicensees performed no experiments. The numbers given above include 22\r\nlicensees whose licences expired on February 28, 1905, and who\r\nreturned no experiments in 1905.\r\n\r\nTables I., II., and III. afford evidence,--\r\n\r\n   1. That licences and certificates have been granted and allowed\r\n   only upon the recommendation of persons of high scientific\r\n   standing;\r\n\r\n   2. That the licensees are persons who, by their training and\r\n   education, are fitted to undertake experimental work and to\r\n   profit by it;\r\n\r\n   3. That all experimental work has been conducted in suitable\r\n   places.\r\n\r\nTable IV. shows the number and the nature of the experiments returned\r\nby each licensee mentioned in Table II., specifying whether these\r\nexperiments were done under the licence alone or under any special\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nTable IV. is divided into two parts, A. and B., for the purpose of\r\nseparating experiments which were performed without anæsthetics from\r\nexperiments in which anæsthetics were used.\r\n\r\nThe total number of experiments included in Table IV. (A.) is 2506.\r\n\r\nOf these there were performed,--\r\n\r\n    Under Licence alone[44]      1348\r\n      \"   Certificate C.         145\r\n      \"   Certificate B.         665\r\n      \"   Certificate B. + EE    346\r\n      \"   Certificate B. + F.      2\r\n\r\n  [44] In experiments performed under licence alone, the animal must\r\n  during the whole of the experiment be under the influence of some\r\n  anæsthetic of sufficient power to prevent the animal feeling pain;\r\n  and the animal must, if the pain is likely to continue after the\r\n  effect of the anæsthetic has ceased, or if any serious injury has\r\n  been inflicted on the animal, be killed before it recovers from\r\n  the influence of the anæsthetic which has been administered.\r\n\r\n  Certificate C. allows experiments to be performed, under the\r\n  foregoing provisions as to the use of anæsthetics, in illustration\r\n  of lectures.\r\n\r\n  Certificate B. exempts the person performing the experiment from\r\n  the obligation to cause the animal on which the experiment is\r\n  performed to be killed before it recovers from the influence of\r\n  the anæsthetic; and when the animal is a dog or a cat, Certificate\r\n  EE. is also necessary.\r\n\r\n  Certificate A. allows experiments to be performed without\r\n  anæsthetics; and when the animal on which the experiment is\r\n  performed is a dog or a cat, Certificate E. is also necessary.\r\n\r\n  Certificate F. is required in all cases of experiments on a horse,\r\n  ass, or mule.\r\n\r\nTable IV. (B.) is devoted entirely to inoculations, hypodermic\r\ninjections, and some few other proceedings, performed without\r\nanæsthetics. It includes 35,429 experiments, whereof there were\r\nperformed,--\r\n\r\n    Under Certificate A.         34,778\r\n      \"   Certificate A. + E.       549\r\n      \"   Certificate A. + F.       102\r\n\r\nThe total number of experiments is 37,935, being 5373 more than in\r\n1904; the increase in the number of experiments included in Table IV.\r\n(A.) is 290, and in Table IV. (B.), 5083.\r\n\r\nAll experiments involving a serious operation are placed in Table IV.\r\n(A.). The larger part of the experiments included in this Table, viz.,\r\nall performed under licence alone, and under Certificate C., 1493 in\r\nnumber, come under the provision of the Act that the animal must be\r\nkept under an anæsthetic during the whole of the experiment, and must,\r\nif the pain is likely to continue after the effect of the anæsthetic\r\nhas ceased, or if any serious injury has been inflicted on the animal,\r\nbe killed before it recovers from the influence of the anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments performed under Certificate B., or B. linked with\r\nEE. or with F., 1013 in number, the initial operations are performed\r\nunder anæsthetics, from the influence of which the animals are allowed\r\nto recover. The operations are required to be performed\r\nantiseptically, so that the healing of the wounds shall, as far as\r\npossible, take place without pain. If the antiseptic precautions fail,\r\nand suppuration occurs, the animal is required to be killed. It is\r\ngenerally essential for the success of these experiments that the\r\nwounds should heal cleanly, and the surrounding parts remain in a\r\nhealthy condition. After the healing of the wounds the animals are not\r\nnecessarily, or even generally, in pain, since experiments involving\r\nthe removal of important organs, including portions of the brain, may\r\nbe performed without giving rise to pain after the recovery from the\r\noperation; and after the section of a part of the nervous system, the\r\nresulting degenerative changes are painless.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a subsequent operation being necessary in an\r\nexperiment performed under Certificate B., or B. linked with EE. or\r\nwith F., a condition is attached to the licence requiring all\r\noperative procedures to be carried out under anæsthetics of sufficient\r\npower to prevent the animal feeling pain; and no observations or\r\nstimulations of a character to cause pain are allowed to be made\r\nwithout the animals being anæsthetised.\r\n\r\nIn no case has a cutting operation more severe than a superficial\r\nvenesection been allowed to be performed without anæsthetics.\r\n\r\nThe experiments included in Table IV. (B.), 35,429 in number, are all\r\nperformed without anæsthetics. They are mostly inoculations, but a few\r\nare feeding experiments, or the administration of various substances\r\nby the mouth, or the abstraction of a minute quantity of blood for\r\nexamination. In no instance has a certificate dispensing with the use\r\nof anæsthetics been allowed for an experiment involving a serious\r\noperation. Inoculations into deep parts, involving a preliminary\r\nincision in order to expose the part into which the inoculation is to\r\nbe made, are required to be performed under anæsthetics, and are\r\ntherefore placed in Table IV. (A.).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the operative procedures in experiments performed\r\nunder Certificate A., without anæsthetics, are only such as are\r\nattended by no considerable, if appreciable, pain. The Certificate is,\r\nin fact, not required to cover these proceedings, but to allow of the\r\nsubsequent course of the experiment. The experiment lasts during the\r\nwhole period from the administration of the drug, or injection, until\r\nthe animal recovers from the effects, if any, or dies, or is killed,\r\npossibly extending over several days, or even weeks. The substance\r\nadministered may give rise to poisoning, or set up a condition of\r\ndisease, either of which may lead to a fatal termination. To\r\nadminister to an animal such a poison as diphtheria toxin, for\r\nexample, or to induce such a disease as tuberculosis, although it may\r\nnot be accompanied by acute suffering, is held to be a proceeding\r\n\"calculated to give pain,\" and therefore experiments of the kind\r\nreferred to come within the scope of the Act 39 & 40 Vict., c. 77. The\r\nAct provides that, unless a special certificate be obtained, the\r\nanimal must be kept under an anæsthetic during the whole of the\r\nexperiment; and it is to allow the animal to be kept without an\r\nanæsthetic during the time required for the development of the results\r\nof the administration that Certificate A. is given and allowed in\r\nthese cases.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the animal is in pain during the whole of\r\nthis time. In cases of prolonged action of an injected substance, even\r\nwhen ending fatally, the animal is generally apparently well, and\r\ntakes its food as usual, until a short time before death. The state of\r\nillness may last only a very few hours, and in some cases it is not\r\nobserved at all.\r\n\r\nIn a very large number of the experiments included in Table IV. (B.),\r\nthe results are negative, and the animals suffer no inconvenience\r\nwhatever from the inoculation. These experiments are therefore\r\nentirely painless.\r\n\r\nIn the event of pain ensuing as the result of an inoculation, a\r\ncondition attached to the licence requires that the animal shall be\r\nkilled under anæsthetics as soon as the main result of the experiment\r\nhas been attained.\r\n\r\nThe number of inoculations and similar proceedings recorded in Table\r\nIV. (B.) continues to increase in accordance with the progressive\r\nimportance attached to biological tests generally in practical\r\nmedicine for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease, and\r\nto the more widely recognised need for such experiments on the part of\r\nthose responsible for the care of the public health. Several County\r\nCouncils and Municipal Corporations have their own laboratories in\r\nwhich bacteriological investigations are carried on, including the\r\nnecessary tests on living animals; and many others have arrangements\r\nby which similar observations are made on their behalf in the\r\nlaboratories of Universities, Colleges, and other Institutions. A\r\nsewage farm is registered as a place in which experiments on living\r\nanimals may be performed in order that the character of the effluent\r\nmay be tested by its effects on the health of fish. The Board of\r\nAgriculture has two laboratories which are registered for the\r\nperformance of experiments having for their object the detection and\r\nstudy of the diseases of animals. In other places experiments have\r\nbeen made on behalf of the Home Office, the War Office, the India\r\nOffice, the Local Government Board, the Office of Works, the Board of\r\nAgriculture and Fisheries, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board. A very\r\nlarge proportion of the experiments in Table IV. (B.) have thus been\r\nperformed either on behalf of Official Bodies with a view to the\r\npreservation of the public health, or directly for the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of disease. Forty-one licensees return over 8000 experiments\r\nwhich were performed for Government Departments, County Councils, or\r\nMunicipal Corporations; 2187 experiments were made by four licensees\r\nfor the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis; twelve licensees performed\r\n6265 experiments, almost all inoculations, for testing antitoxic sera\r\nand vaccines and standardising drugs; and 12,187 experiments, mostly\r\ninoculations into mice, were performed on behalf of the Imperial\r\nCancer Research Fund.\r\n\r\nThe number of injections made during the year 1905 for the diagnosis\r\nof rabies in dogs is 27; these are placed in Table IV. (A.).\r\n\r\nDuring the year the usual inspections of registered places have been\r\nmade by Sir James Russell, by myself, and by Mr. W. B. L. Trotter, who\r\nwas appointed temporary Assistant Inspector during my absence for\r\nthree months. We have found the animals suitably lodged and well cared\r\nfor, and the licensees attentive to the requirements of the Act, as\r\nwell as to the conditions appended to their licences by the Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nThe irregularities recorded during the year have been few, and not of\r\na serious character.\r\n\r\nTwo licensees, holding certificates (A.) entitling them to perform\r\ninoculations without anæsthetics, administered an anæsthetic during\r\nsome of their experiments, whereas the Act prescribes another form of\r\ncertificate (B.) when an animal is anæsthetised during an experiment\r\nand allowed to recover from the anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nA licensee, through inadvertence, performed 54 inoculation experiments\r\nin excess of the number allowed by his certificate.\r\n\r\nAnother licensee, not understanding that joint experiments are\r\nreckoned to both of the licensees, took part in the performance of\r\neight experiments in excess of the number allowed by his certificate.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the Secretary of State a suitable admonition was\r\naddressed to the licensee in each of the above cases.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April 1905 the attention of the Secretary of State was\r\ndirected to certain experiments which were performed in 1903 and the\r\nearly part of 1904 by persons not holding a licence under the Act 39 &\r\n40 Vict. c. 77. The experiments consisted in vaccinating dogs against\r\ndistemper and then exposing them to infection, the object being to\r\ntest the efficacy of a method of vaccination as a safeguard against\r\nthis disease. The Secretary of State thereupon caused inquiries to be\r\nmade, and from these it appeared that the experiments, in some\r\ninstances at least, had been accompanied by pain, and were, therefore,\r\nillegal. The persons, who were not aware that their experiments were\r\nof such a kind as to come within the provisions of the Act, were\r\nsuitably admonished and warned against any similar illegal action in\r\nthe future. The matter was not brought to the knowledge of the\r\nSecretary of State until it was too late for further proceedings to be\r\ntaken if such had been considered necessary. It is as well to point\r\nout here that to expose an animal to an infectious and painful disease\r\nlike distemper is a proceeding calculated to cause pain within the\r\nmeaning of the Act, and that such experiments can only be legally\r\nperformed by a person holding a licence and appropriate\r\ncertificates.--I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    G.

One new license was granted.\r\n\r\nThe certificates in existence or allowed were:--\r\n\r\n    A.  to 4 licensees.\r\n    B.  \"  7     \"\r\n    C.  \"  3     \"\r\n    E.  \"  2     \"\r\n    EE. \"  3     \"\r\n    F.  \"  1 licensee.\r\n\r\nOne expired during the year, and six new ones were allowed.\r\n\r\nThe experiments performed number 218; 106 being under licence alone,\r\nand 112 under certificates. Ten licensees performed experiments.\r\nTwenty certificates were in force among 12 licensees, of whom 10\r\nperformed experiments, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    Under Certificate A.      88\r\n      \"       \"       B.      14\r\n      \"       \"       C.       8\r\n      \"       \"       F.       2\r\n\r\nThe animals experimented on were:--\r\n\r\n    Guinea pigs   55\r\n    Birds         53\r\n    Rabbits       48\r\n    Cattle        27\r\n    Mice          14\r\n    Dogs          13\r\n    Cats           2\r\n    Horses         2\r\n    Goats          2\r\n    Sheep          2\r\n\r\nThe experiments were mainly pathological inoculations, done for the\r\npurposes of the investigation or diagnosis of various diseases, such\r\nas canine rabies, tuberculosis, cancer, glanders, and typhoid fever. A\r\nfew were physiological, for the investigation of the functions of the\r\nthymus gland, and of the effects of chloroform and ether on renal\r\nactivity. All of these seem to have been of a reasonable character and\r\nintended to serve useful purposes in the elucidation of the phenomena\r\nof disease or of vital functions. They are reported to have been free\r\nfrom pain.\r\n\r\nExperiments numbering eight were performed in illustration of\r\nlectures, to demonstrate the phenomena of circulation and respiration\r\nand of nervous control. In these experiments, two dogs, two cats, and\r\nfour rabbits were employed.\r\n\r\nSome of the investigations were devoted to the study of diseases in\r\ncattle, horses, goats, and sheep, and seem to be useful and of\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\nThe registered places were inspected and their condition found\r\nsatisfactory. The inspectors in Belfast and Cork report that in those\r\nplaces the provisions of the Act have been satisfactorily complied\r\nwith.--I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n    W. THORNLEY STOKER,\r\n    _Inspector for Ireland_.\r\n\r\n    To the Right Honourable\r\n    The Chief Secretary to the\r\n    Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis Report gives a clear answer to certain false statements alleged\r\nagainst experiments on animals. It shows that more than 90 _per cent._\r\nof these experiments are inoculations, with a few feeding experiments,\r\nadministrations of substances by the mouth, or abstractions of a\r\nminute quantity of blood for examination. _In no instance has a\r\ncertificate dispensing with the use of anæsthetics been allowed for an\r\nexperiment involving a serious operation. In no case has a cutting\r\noperation more severe than a superficial venesection been allowed to\r\nbe performed without anæsthetics._ It shows, also, that the results,\r\nin a very large number of these inoculations, are negative, painless,\r\nnot even inconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe Report shows, also, that the vast majority of all experiments are\r\ninoculations made on the smaller animals; and that the larger animals\r\n(dog, cat, horse, mule, or ass) are seldom used for inoculation.\r\n\r\nIt shows, also, that a great proportion of these inoculations are made\r\nin the direct practical service of the public health and the public\r\npurse: to standardise drugs, to ensure the purity of food and of\r\nrivers, to protect flocks and herds, and to decide quarantine.\r\nGovernment Departments, County Councils, Municipal Corporations, and a\r\nRoyal Commission made more than one-third of the total number of\r\ninoculations; and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund made more than\r\none-third, mostly on mice; and a sixth was made over the testing and\r\nstandardising of sera and of drugs.\r\n\r\nThe operations performed under the License + Certificate B, or B + EE,\r\nor B + F, were 3 per cent. of the whole number of experiments. The\r\nmajority of the animals were neither cats nor dogs. They can hardly\r\nbe compared to the same number of the larger animals mutilated by\r\nbreeders and farmers: for these mutilations may be inflicted, and are\r\ninflicted, without an anæsthetic. They can hardly be compared to the\r\nsame number of pheasants or rabbits wounded, but not killed, in sport;\r\nfor the animals wounded in sport get no subsequent care, and, if they\r\nare in pain, nobody need put them out of it. They may fairly be\r\ncompared to the same number of pet animals that have undergone\r\nsurgical operations, under anæsthesia, at the hands of a skilled\r\nveterinary surgeon; only with this difference, that many of them lose\r\nhealth, or suffer disablement or disease, and so die or are killed;\r\nbut, if the wound suppurates, the animal must be killed, and, after\r\nthe wound has healed, the animals are not necessarily, or even\r\ngenerally, in pain. And there must be no _further_ experiment without\r\nanæsthesia. _No observations or stimulations of a character to cause\r\npain are allowed to be made without the animals being anæsthetised._\r\nIt is evident that good care is taken to ensure an irreducible minimum\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nTHE CASE AGAINST ANTI-VIVISECTION\r\n\r\nTHE CASE AGAINST ANTI-VIVISECTION\r\n\r\n   [The following pages are taken, with a few changes and\r\n   omissions, from a pamphlet which I published in 1904. I am glad\r\n   to say that the tone of the Anti-Vivisection Societies is not\r\n   quite so bad as it was a few years ago; but I think that what I\r\n   wrote in 1904 is still fairly accurate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nThe early history of the anti-vivisection movement is given in a\r\npamphlet by Dr. Leffingwell, of Brooklyn, entitled \"The Rise of the\r\nVivisection Controversy\"; and in a pamphlet published by the National\r\nAnti-vivisection Society, entitled \"Dates of the Principal Events\r\nconnected with the Anti-vivisection Movement.\" Dr. Leffingwell calls\r\nattention to a fact not generally known--that the movement, in this\r\ncountry, was begun by the medical journals. The _Medical Times and\r\nGazette_ in 1858, the _Lancet_ in 1860, and the _British Medical\r\nJournal_ in 1861 condemned in a very outspoken way certain experiments\r\nmade on the Continent, and raised the question whether these or any\r\nexperiments on animals could be justified. Later, in 1872, the\r\n_Medical Times and Gazette_ declared outright that all experiments,\r\nfrom the time of Magendie onward, had done nothing for humanity that\r\ncould be compared to the discovery and use of cod-liver oil and bark.\r\nIn 1874, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\r\ntook proceedings against those who had made certain experiments at\r\nNorwich during a meeting of the British Medical Association. These\r\nexperiments, and the publication of the _Handbook of the Physiological\r\nLaboratory_, roused public comment; and during 1875 the opposition to\r\nall experiments on animals took more definite form. On June 22nd,\r\n1875, the Royal Commission was appointed; on January 8th, 1876, its\r\nreport was dated; and on August 15th, 1876, the present Act received\r\nthe Royal assent.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Royal Commission was appointed, the only\r\nanti-vivisection society was that which Mr. Jesse had just started;\r\nand if any one will read Mr. Jesse's cross-examination, by Professor\r\nHuxley, before the Royal Commission, he will not attach much\r\nimportance to that society. The National Anti-vivisection Society was\r\nfounded in November 1875; the Irish Society, the London Society, and\r\nthe International Association in 1876; the Church Anti-vivisection\r\nLeague in 1889, the Humanitarian League and the National Canine\r\nDefence League[45] in 1891, and the British Union about 1898. These\r\ndates show that the oldest of these societies came after the Royal\r\nCommission, not before it; the first societies and the Royal\r\nCommission were alike the expression of a widespread opinion, thirty\r\nyears ago, that experiments on animals ought either to be forbidden or\r\nto be restricted. This same opinion had been favoured, fifteen years\r\nbefore that, by the representative journals of the medical profession.\r\nWe have seen something of the work of the medical profession; let us\r\nnow see something of the work of the societies.\r\n\r\n  [45] These two societies have other purposes beside that of\r\n  opposition to experiments on animals.\r\n\r\nThe chief anti-vivisection societies in this country are the National\r\nSociety, the London Society, the British Union, the Church League, and\r\nthe Canine Defence League. In February 1898, the National Society\r\ndeclared itself in favour of restriction; it set before itself\r\nabolition as its ultimate policy, and restriction as its immediate\r\npractical policy. Thus, at the present time, these societies are\r\ndivided into two parties: one asks for restriction, another asks for\r\nnothing short of abolition. This division between them, and the tone\r\nof the National Society toward the smaller Societies, waste their\r\nenergy and their funds, and hinder them from working together. The\r\nNational Society, in its official journal (January 1902), speaks as\r\nfollows of this schism, in a leader entitled \"The Folly of our\r\nSubdivisions\":--\r\n\r\n   \"Nobody seems to know how many Anti-vivisection Societies there\r\n   are. A few hundred Anti-vivisectionists divide themselves up\r\n   into divisions, subdivisions, coteries, and cliques, without\r\n   order, without discipline, without cohesion. The\r\n   Anti-vivisectionists between them all contribute but a few\r\n   thousands a year, and dribble them around among multitudinous\r\n   antagonistic associations.... The pitiful absurdity of the\r\n   disunion fostered by some Anti-vivisectionists was illustrated\r\n   very forcibly last year by the issue of a prospectus of a\r\n   Society with a world-embracing title, in which its promoters\r\n   declared that irreparable injury would be inflicted upon our\r\n   cause if electoral work were not taken up by _them_.... The\r\n   accounts of this stupendous organisation showed that its total\r\n   expenditure for the year was £13, 19s. 4d., out of which ten\r\n   shillings was devoted to 'electoral work.' ... A much graver\r\n   injury is done to the cause of mercy by the deplorable waste of\r\n   money spent in perfectly unnecessary offices and salaries. We\r\n   say that one office would amply suffice for all the work, and\r\n   that one office would not need half-a-dozen paid Secretaries.\r\n   The existence of many quite needless Societies cannot be\r\n   justified on any grounds of humanity combined with common\r\n   sense.\"\r\n\r\nNothing need be added to these very grave admissions, written by Mr.\r\nColeridge himself. He proposes a very simple remedy for these \"quite\r\nneedless\" societies:--\r\n\r\n   \"The National Society, as the chief Anti-vivisection\r\n   organisation in the world, is always ready to put an end to this\r\n   grievous waste by receiving into its corporation any of the\r\n   smaller Societies.\"\r\n\r\nBut the leaders of smaller societies have two grounds of complaint\r\nagainst Mr. Coleridge's society: they do not believe in his policy,\r\nand they will not submit to his \"discipline.\" They call his society\r\n\"the weak-kneed brethren,\" and say that its policy is \"miserable,\r\ncowardly, and misleading\"; and they take it ill that he so often\r\naccuses them of inaccuracy. He refers again and again (see the\r\nofficial journal of the National Society) to this mode of\r\ndiscipline:--\r\n\r\n   _December 1901._--\"I decline to be made responsible for the\r\n   'anti-vivisection party.' There happen to be small\r\n   anti-vivisection associations whose chief occupation is the\r\n   dissemination of quite inaccurate pamphlets. I have nothing to\r\n   do with them, and cannot prevent anything they choose to do.\"\r\n\r\n   _January 1902._--\"Time after time has this sacred cause been\r\n   undermined and betrayed by its professing friends by their\r\n   reckless habit of making erroneous statements.\"\r\n\r\n   _March 1902._--\"I am quite aware that with many of my opponents\r\n   in the exclusive total-abolition coterie, the motives that\r\n   actuate them are far removed from the question of the salvation\r\n   of the wretched animals, and have their foundation in emotions\r\n   that seem to me singularly unworthy and petty.\"\r\n\r\n   _May 1902._--\"As representative of the National Society, I have\r\n   again and again written to the representatives of some of the\r\n   smaller anti-vivisection societies, protesting in plain terms\r\n   against their publication of inaccurate statements.\"\r\n\r\nNo society could submit to be thus taken to task four times in six\r\nmonths. The Church League writes to him, \"What the Church League may\r\nor may not think fit to say does not in the very least concern you,\r\nwho are not a member of the League. Interference in such a matter from\r\nan outsider is an obvious impertinence.\" Such rejoinders are met, in\r\ntheir turn, by angry leaders, \"A Stab in the Back,\" \"Stabs in the\r\nBack,\" in the National Society's official journal; and the Hon.\r\nSecretary of the London Society, who is a lady, is accused of want of\r\nchivalry for Mr. Coleridge. The leader, \"A Stab in the Back\" (April\r\n1902), is a curious instance of the tone of one anti-vivisection\r\nsociety toward another:--\r\n\r\n   \"The time when a man is assailed by a large section of the\r\n   press, threatened with violence by laymen, attacked on points\r\n   relevant by vivisectors and points irrelevant by their\r\n   supporters, is scarcely the moment that a generous rival would\r\n   have chosen for hurling a dart; and yet, incredible as it may\r\n   appear, the Honorary Secretary of another Anti-vivisection\r\n   Society, seizing an opportunity afforded by an article in the\r\n   _Globe_, enters the arena, and, by a letter repudiating any\r\n   connection with Mr. Coleridge, appears to sanction the\r\n   unfriendly criticisms expressed in that paper. It needed no\r\n   chivalry to refrain from writing such a letter. A small amount\r\n   of good taste would have amply sufficed.... This letter, which\r\n   will convince the public of nothing but the writer's lack of\r\n   taste, might well be ignored were it not that it is but one of\r\n   the many attacks made by members of other societies, either by\r\n   open statement or innuendo, against the Honorary Secretary of\r\n   the National Society.\"\r\n\r\nBut we cannot wonder at these occasional stabs. For the National\r\nSociety does not stop at charging other societies with inaccuracy. It\r\nmakes yet graver charges against them. Here are three made by Mr.\r\nColeridge's society against Miss Cobbe's and Mr. Trist's societies:--\r\n\r\n   _March 1901._--\"The February number of the _Abolitionist_\r\n   contains a leading article in which allusions are made to\r\n   subjects that are never discussed by decent people even in\r\n   private. As the leading organ of the Anti-vivisection movement,\r\n   we enter our solemn protest against the publication of this\r\n   unspeakable article, which must inevitably inflict the gravest\r\n   injury upon our cause.\"\r\n\r\n   _February 1903._--\"It is our duty to inform our readers that Mr.\r\n   Trist has published the correspondence, but that he has\r\n   mutilated it, omitting some of his own letters altogether, and\r\n   excising whole paragraphs of Mr. Stewart's letters.\"\r\n\r\n   _June 1903._--\"Our amiable contemporary, the _Abolitionist_, is\r\n   good enough, in a long article in its last issue, to suggest to\r\n   those preparing the libel action against Mr. Coleridge what are\r\n   the most vulnerable points in his armour.\"\r\n\r\nThus divided in policy, and quarrelling among themselves, these\r\nsocieties are still agreed in appealing to the public for approval and\r\nfor money. Here the London Society's opposition to the National\r\nSociety comes out clearly. In its annual report (1903) the London\r\nSociety says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Join a really effective Society with a frank and\r\n   straightforward policy--namely, the London Anti-vivisection\r\n   Society, 13 Regent Street, London, S.W. This is a National and\r\n   International organisation. It has greater medical support than\r\n   any other. It is the most 'alive' humane organisation in the\r\n   world.... Get into touch with the society. Write to us. We shall\r\n   be glad to hear from you and answer any questions.\"\r\n\r\n   \"If you can provide for the Society's future in your Will, may\r\n   we beg of you to do so? If you agree, pray do it now. Thousands\r\n   of pounds have been lost to the Society and the Cause by the\r\n   fatal procrastination of well-meaning friends. The pity of it!\r\n   Legacies should be left in these _exact_ words: 'To the _London_\r\n   Anti-vivisection Society.' CAUTION. It is of great importance to\r\n   describe very accurately the _Title of this Society_--namely,\r\n   THE LONDON ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY--otherwise the benevolent\r\n   intentions of the Donor may be frustrated. PLEASE NOTE.--Those\r\n   charitable persons who have left money to the Society would do\r\n   well to notify the same to the Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nContrast the tone of this appeal for money with the tone of the\r\nReport:----\r\n\r\n   \"Your Society are glad to note that the Christian Churches are\r\n   becoming alarmed at the pretensions of scientific authority....\r\n   The Christian laity has been largely uninstructed or misinformed\r\n   on this grave question.... Happily, the signs of the times are\r\n   propitious; not all of the leaders of religious thought in this\r\n   country have succumbed to the dictation and pretensions of the\r\n   professors of vivisection ... a base and blatant materialism, a\r\n   practice which owes its inception to barbarism, and which has\r\n   developed in materialism of the lowest possible order.\"\r\n\r\nSurely such eloquence should avail to tear the money even out of the\r\nhands of the dying, lest the National Society should get it. The\r\nNational Society, oddly enough, also says: \"CAUTION.--It is of great\r\nimportance to describe very accurately the _Title of this\r\nSociety_--namely, THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY--otherwise\r\nthe benevolent intentions of the Donor may be frustrated.\" I do not\r\nknow which of these two societies is the inventor of this phrase.\r\nStill, it is not improbable that the National Society receives more\r\nmoney than all the smaller societies together. Of course, we cannot\r\ncompare the working expenses of an anti-vivisection society with the\r\nworking expenses of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals, or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\r\nThe former of these two societies in one year obtained 8798\r\nconvictions; in one month alone, 689 convictions; and it paid the\r\nfull costs of committing 34 of the 689 to prison. The Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Children has an equally good record. But\r\nan anti-vivisectionist society cannot show results of this kind. Nor\r\ncan we compare its working expenses to those of a missionary society;\r\nfor the missionaries give direct personal service to their fellow-men.\r\nBut we can fairly compare an anti-vivisection society to an\r\nanti-vaccination society or a Church of Christian Science. That is to\r\nsay, it is a publishing body. In 1902, the National Society's\r\nexpenditure, in round numbers, was £970 on printing and stationery;\r\n£1193 on rent, salaries, and wages; £1255 on books, newspapers,\r\nperiodicals, &c., including the _Illustrated Catalogue_ and the\r\n_Hospital Guide_; £1380 on lectures, meetings, organising new\r\nbranches, &c.; and about £500 on all other expenses. Let us take, to\r\nillustrate these figures, what the National Society says from time to\r\ntime in its official journal:--\r\n\r\n   _June 1899._--(From the Society's Annual Report): \"The whole\r\n   controversy has been collected and published in pamphlet form by\r\n   your Society, and more than 10,000 copies have already been\r\n   issued to the public. Over 200 people have joined your ranks\r\n   and become members of the Society in consequence of it, while\r\n   two cheques of £1000 each were received by Mr. Coleridge in aid\r\n   of the cause.\"\r\n\r\n   _June 1899._--\"We have received more money within the past six\r\n   months than we got in any two years previously.\"\r\n\r\n   _June 1899._--\"We cannot better employ the funds at our disposal\r\n   than in securing the constant help of experts to insure the\r\n   accuracy of all our statements, and in sending well-informed\r\n   lecturers to every city in the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n   _June 1900._--(From the Society's Annual Report): \"The receipts\r\n   of the society from subscriptions and donations show an increase\r\n   over those of the previous year. This increase in itself,\r\n   however, would hardly have justified the increase in the\r\n   expenses which it has been found necessary to incur in almost\r\n   every department, and especially in the distribution of\r\n   pamphlets and papers, had it not been for some legacies which\r\n   fell due, notably one from----, of £6386.\"\r\n\r\n   _May 1901._--\"With heartfelt gratitude we have once more to\r\n   announce that the National Society has received a gift of a\r\n   thousand pounds from an anonymous donor. Nothing could be more\r\n   opportune for the Cause than this munificent support, coming as\r\n   it does just as the issue of 20,000 copies of Mr. Stephen\r\n   Coleridge's _Hospital Guide_ has been made at so great a cost to\r\n   the Society.\"\r\n\r\n   _June 1901._--\"Our editorial table is buried deep in press\r\n   cuttings from all parts of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n   _March 1902._--\"We employ two press-cutting agencies to send us\r\n   cuttings from the journals of the whole English-speaking world.\"\r\n\r\n   _July 1903._--\"We start branches in various towns, and send\r\n   lecturers to speak at working men's clubs and debating\r\n   societies. All this means a very large expense. We very often\r\n   issue a pamphlet likely to do good by the tens of thousands.\r\n   Last year we issued 50,000 copies of the 'Illustrated German\r\n   Catalogue of Vivisectional Instruments and Appliances.'\"\r\n\r\nThe smaller societies, of course, spend their funds in the same sort\r\nof way. Thus the National Canine Defence League says that its\r\nanti-vivisection work, the most important of all its works, is\r\nearnestly carried forward by (1) The Writer's League, in a ceaseless\r\nflow of letters to the press; (2) The circulation of lists of\r\nhospitals free from the shameful practice; (3) The publication of\r\ntwenty-one strong leaflets on the subject; (4) The circulation of 300\r\ncopies of a book on the subject. This society in two years sent out\r\n650,000 leaflets and pamphlets; but they were not all of them about\r\nexperiments on animals. Another Society, in a report published in\r\n1902, enumerates the methods which it employs for \"the education of\r\nthe public at large.\" These include (_a_) the publication of\r\nliterature; (_b_) the holding of public meetings in all parts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom; (_c_) the delivery of lectures with or without\r\nlimelight illustrations; (_d_) participation in debates even with high\r\nscientific authorities; (_e_) inducing the clergy and ministers of all\r\nChurches to deliver sermons dealing with the subject; (_f_)\r\norganisation of a press bureau, through which the newspaper press of\r\nthe country is watched, and correspondence and articles contributed.\r\nThis Society has also a van, \"the only one of its kind in existence.\r\nNo sooner is our winter and spring campaign concluded than the van\r\ntakes up the thread of the work and carries it on through the summer,\r\nand it may truly be said that the track of the van across country is\r\nwhite with the literature which the van circulates on its educational\r\nmission.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from these and the like statements, that these\r\nSocieties, during the last quarter of a century, have published a vast\r\nquantity of literature. We must examine the style of that literature\r\nduring some recent years, and the arguments which it puts forward.\r\nBut, before we do this, let us consider what attitude is taken by\r\nthese Societies, or by well-known members of this or that Society,\r\ntoward certain problems and interests that closely concern them.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThey do not hesitate to take advantage of all those improvements of\r\nmedicine and surgery which have been made by the help of experiments\r\non animals. They denounce the work of the present; but they enjoy all\r\nthe results of the past, and will enjoy all those of the near future.\r\n\"If anything of value to medicine has been discovered by vivisection,\r\nit would be as absurd to reject it on that account as it would be to\r\nabandon Ireland because centuries ago we took it by force.\" And again:\r\n\"We are no more morally bound to reject benefits acquired by\r\nindefensible means than are the descendants of slaveholders bound to\r\nabandon wealth originally acquired by the detestable abomination of\r\nslavery.\" And again, the _Animal's Friend_ (November 1903) takes as\r\nfurther instances the benefits derived from body-snatching, political\r\nassassination, and the French Revolution. But, in the matter of\r\nexperiments on animals, it is the very same men and women who denounce\r\nthese experiments and who profit by them. What should we say of an\r\nanti-slavery reformer who was himself drawing a vast income out of the\r\nslave trade?\r\n\r\nBut there is one gentleman, and, so far as I know, only one, who did\r\ncarry his opinions into practice. He told the story at a debating\r\nmeeting--how his little girl had a sore throat, and the doctor wanted\r\nto give antitoxin, and he forbade it, and the child recovered. \"Of\r\ncourse,\" he says, \"it was only an ordinary sore throat.\" Truly, a\r\ngreat victory, and a brave deed, to make an experiment on your own\r\nsick child.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe attitude of these Societies toward sport may seem at first sight\r\npurely negative; but it is worth study. I have the honour of knowing a\r\nvery eminent physiologist who will never shoot, because he thinks it\r\ncruel--a man much abused by the National Society. And Lord\r\nLlangattock, the President of that Society, is well known as an a\r\n\"ardent sportsman.\"\r\n\r\nThis contrast is of some interest. Let us see what the National\r\nSociety says about sport. Of course, it is not bound to attack sport.\r\nBut the reasons which it gives for remaining neutral are to be noted.\r\n\r\n1. It says, very truly, that it is in great part supported by\r\nsportsmen.\r\n\r\n2. It says, further, that the cruelties of sport lie outside its own\r\nproper work:--\r\n\r\n   \"Our opponents frequently ask us why we do not attack some form\r\n   of cruelty other than vivisection, which they consider more\r\n   heinous. Our Honorary Secretary recently summarised this\r\n   argument in his own amusing manner thus: We must not arrest the\r\n   man in Tooting for kicking his wife till we have stopped the\r\n   woman in Balham starving her children, and we must not arrest\r\n   the woman in Balham for starving her children until we have\r\n   stopped the man in Tooting kicking his wife.\" (1901.)\r\n\r\nLater (1903) the _dramatis personæ_ are a man in East Islington\r\njumping on his wife, and a woman in West Islington stabbing her\r\nhusband. But this argument, of course, will not hold. For it is the\r\nsame men who denounce wounds made (under anæsthetics) for physiology,\r\nand who make wounds (without anæsthetics) in sport.\r\n\r\n3. It says that the \"object\" of the sportsman is to kill; but the\r\n\"object\" of the experimenter is to torture:--\r\n\r\n   \"There is a vast difference between the killing of animals and\r\n   the torturing of them before killing them. The object of the\r\n   sportsman is to kill his quarry; the object of the vivisector is\r\n   to keep his victim alive while he dissects it.\"--Mr. Wood\r\n   (1903).\r\n\r\n   \"The object of the sportsman is to kill, and the object of the\r\n   vivisector is to keep his victim alive while he cuts it\r\n   up.\"--Lord Llangattock (1901).\r\n\r\n   \"The vivisector is nothing if not a tormentor; the sportsman is\r\n   not a true sportsman if he seeks to inflict pain on his\r\n   quarry.... One (the pain of a horse falling on asphalt) is the\r\n   result of an accident to be deplored, the other (the pain from\r\n   an experiment) is done of devilish malice prepense.\"--Leader in\r\n   the Society's official journal, (1899).\r\n\r\n   \"I am not so mentally and ethically confused as to be unable to\r\n   distinguish between the entirely different moral acts of killing\r\n   and torturing.\"--Mr. Coleridge (1901).\r\n\r\nHere are four statements. One is by Mr. Wood, the Society's lecturer;\r\none by Lord Llangattock, its President; one is published in its\r\nofficial journal; and one is by Mr. Coleridge, its honorary secretary\r\nand treasurer. That is the sort of thing which seems good enough to\r\nthe National Society to say to its friends in Parliament; this\r\nchildish nonsense about the true sportsman and his quarry.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe attitude of these Societies toward the medical profession, and\r\ntoward the Hospitals, must be studied. Let us look through some\r\nnumbers of the official journal of the National Society, and see the\r\nattitude that it sometimes takes toward the medical profession:--\r\n\r\n   _June 1899._--\"The charm of this sort of thing is that you are\r\n   always sure of the _post-mortem_ if of nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n   _July 1899._--\"There is a disease, well known to the vestrymen\r\n   of London, called 'the half-crown diphtheria.' This is common\r\n   sore throat, notified as diphtheria because the vestry pays a\r\n   fee of half-a-crown to the medical notifier.\"\r\n\r\n   _December 1899._--\"The patient died, made miserable by the\r\n   effect of inoculations which even on bacteriological grounds\r\n   gave no promise of success, but the scientific physician,\r\n   nowadays, must inject something in the way of a serum.\"\r\n\r\n   _March 1901._--\"There will always be those who, unable to think\r\n   for themselves or exercise their independence on therapeutic\r\n   methods, are prone to bow down before authority which is\r\n   self-assertive enough to compel the obedience of weak minds.\r\n   Such men would inject antitoxin though every case died. They\r\n   administer it not knowing why.\"\r\n\r\n   _April 1901._--(From \"Our Cause in the Press\"): \"What effort\r\n   does the medical profession make to make clear to its clients\r\n   what is well known to itself, that disease is the result of\r\n   wrong living? Practically none at all. The medical profession as\r\n   a whole have winked at sin, and have merely sought to antidote\r\n   its results.\"\r\n\r\n   _September 1901._--\"Some day we shall have our surgeons\r\n   disembowelling us just to see what daylight and fresh air will\r\n   do for the stomach-ache.\"\r\n\r\n   _December 1901._--\"The new medicine demands a mere laboratory\r\n   habit; the patient is nothing, the disease everything. He is a\r\n   test-tube; such and such reagents are needed to produce a\r\n   certain result, and there you are. The patient's malady, be it\r\n   what it may, is due to a microbe, a toxin, or a ptomaine; he\r\n   must be inoculated with the serum or antitoxin which counteracts\r\n   his disease, and this must be done not _secundum artem_ but\r\n   _secundum scientiam_, and the science means the inoculating\r\n   syringe and so many cubic centimetres of filth wherewith to\r\n   poison the man's blood and so cure his disease, though the\r\n   victims die.\"\r\n\r\n   _December 1903._--(From \"Our Cause in the Press\"): \"Not only did\r\n   we see great callousness in the field hospitals in South Africa,\r\n   but conversation with the class that finds its way into our\r\n   hospitals in England will reveal that a great deal of refined\r\n   cruelty is constantly occurring.\"\r\n\r\nWhy does the official journal of Mr. Coleridge's society publish these\r\nthings? For this reason--that it must attack those methods that were\r\ndiscovered by the help of experiments on animals. The medical\r\nprofession uses these methods. Therefore, that profession must be\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nThe same reason, of course, helps to explain the National Society's\r\nattack on the great Hospitals of London. It would take too long to\r\ntell here the whole story of that attack. Three charges were made\r\nagainst the Hospitals: (1) that they maltreat patients; (2) that they\r\npromote the torture of animals; (3) that they endow this torture at\r\nthe cost of the patients. They were accused, to put it plainly, of\r\ntreachery and fraud; and of course the Council of the King's Hospital\r\nFund got its share of abuse. Mr. Coleridge said on this subject:--\r\n\r\n   1. (Annual meeting at St. James's Hall, May 1901): \"How have\r\n   Lord Lister, the vivisector, and his Committee distributed the\r\n   Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund? They have so distributed this\r\n   fund as to make it clear to hospital managers that the more they\r\n   connect their hospitals with the torture of animals the larger\r\n   will be the grant they may expect to get from the Prince of\r\n   Wales's Fund. That fund, therefore, has been used as an\r\n   insidious but powerful incentive to vivisection.\"\r\n\r\n   2. (Annual meeting at St. James's Hall, 1902): \"Sheltering\r\n   itself now in its most repulsive form behind those ancient and\r\n   glorious institutions, founded and sustained for their\r\n   Christ-like work of healing the sick, sapping their foundations\r\n   and smirching their fair fame, malignant cruelty has taken up\r\n   its position in its last ditch. There it has summoned to its aid\r\n   vast interests, ancient prejudices, enormous endowments, and\r\n   under illustrious patronage it has pilfered the funds subscribed\r\n   for the poor.\"\r\n\r\nWith these statements before us (and it would be easy to add to them)\r\nwe cannot doubt that the plan of campaign against all experiments on\r\nanimals is also hostile to the Hospitals, whenever that hostility\r\nseems likely to be of the very least use to the cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSurely there are charities more worthy of subscriptions, donations,\r\nand legacies than these Anti-vivisection Societies. They quarrel among\r\nthemselves; they spend vast sums of money on offices, salaries,\r\npress-cuttings, reprints, lectures and meetings, tons of pamphlets and\r\nleaflets. Their members denounce all experiments done now, while they\r\nenjoy the profit of all experiments done before now; they say that the\r\nobject of the physiologist is to torture his victim out of devilish\r\nmalice prepense; they accuse doctors of fraud, and lying, and refined\r\ncruelty, and madness, and winking at sin; they blacklist and boycott\r\nthe best Hospitals. And the whole costly business, these thirty years,\r\nhas done nothing to stop these experiments; they have increased\r\nrapidly. Surely, if a man wishes to help and comfort animals, he had\r\nbetter give his money to the Home for Lost Dogs, or the Home of Rest\r\nfor Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nWe have now to examine the style of the literature of these societies.\r\nBut, out of such a vast store of journals, pamphlets, and leaflets, we\r\ncan only take one here or there.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a book or a pamphlet is, for good reasons,\r\nwithdrawn. Thus, in 1902, the London Society withdrew _Dark Deeds_.\r\n(_The Shambles of Science_, now impounded, was published by a chairman\r\nof committee of the National Society, but not by that society.) In\r\n1900 the National Society withdrew one or more pamphlets involving\r\nacceptance of Dr. Bowie's mistranslation of Harvey. In 1902 it\r\nwithdrew and destroyed a whole store of diverse pamphlets, and\r\nappealed to its supporters to \"refrain from circulating any literature\r\nnot issued from our office by the present committee\"; that is to say,\r\nit warned them to distribute no literature but its own, and not all\r\neven of that. But the withdrawal of a few books and pamphlets makes\r\nvery little difference; and most of them are \"revised\" and brought out\r\nagain. Take, for example, the _Nine Circles_. It was planned and\r\ncompiled for Miss Cobbe; Mr. Berdoe was \"urgently requested by her to\r\npoint out to her any scientific errors or possible inadvertent\r\nmisrepresentations of fact, and correct or expunge them\"; and he\r\n\"carefully read through the proof-sheets.\" The book purported to be an\r\nexact account, from original sources, of certain experiments, some\r\nmade abroad, some in this country. It was attacked by Sir Victor\r\nHorsley at the Church Congress at Folkestone, October 1892, and was\r\nwithdrawn, revised, and brought out again. Our only concern here is to\r\nsee what the official journal of the National Society said of the\r\nrevised issue. This official journal, the _Zoophilist and Animal's\r\nDefender_, was started in May 1881, under the shorter title of the\r\n_Zoophilist_. It speaks of itself as a \"scientific journal,\" and as\r\n\"the recognised organ of the anti-vivisection movement in England.\" It\r\nis published monthly, and may be obtained through any bookseller. In\r\n1883 it was edited by Miss Cobbe; in 1884 by Mr. Benjamin Bryan; in\r\n1898 by Mr. Berdoe. In 1903, Mr. Coleridge, apologising for an error\r\nmade in it in 1898, says: \"At that time I had not the control over its\r\npages that is at present accorded to me.\" Thus it is, I believe, still\r\nedited by Mr. Berdoe, and is, or was in 1903, controlled by Mr.\r\nColeridge. And we are bound to note here that Mr. Berdoe was in great\r\npart responsible for the _Nine Circles_; and in 1897 was responsible\r\nfor certain statements as to the use of curare, which the Home\r\nSecretary, in the House of Commons, called \"absolutely baseless.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the style of this \"official journal.\" And, to begin\r\nwith, what does it say about the _Nine Circles_? To make this point\r\nclear, let us put in parallel columns what was said by Sir Victor\r\nHorsley of the original edition in 1892, and what was said by the\r\n_Zoophilist_ in 1899 of the revised edition:--\r\n\r\n   _Sir Victor Horsley, Oct. 1892._\r\n\r\n   I have taken the trouble to collect all the experiments in which\r\n   cutting operations are described as having been performed by\r\n   English scientists, and in which I knew anæsthetics to have been\r\n   employed. These experiments are 26 in number. In all of them\r\n   chloroform, ether, or other anæsthetic agent was employed. But\r\n   of these 26 cases, Miss Cobbe does not mention this fact at all\r\n   in 20, and only states it without qualification in two out of\r\n   the remaining six. When we inquire into these 20 omissions in\r\n   the 26 cases, we find in the original that again and again Miss\r\n   Cobbe has, in making her extracts, had directly under her eyes\r\n   the words \"chloroform,\" \"ether,\" \"etherised,\" \"chloroformed,\"\r\n   \"anæsthetised,\" \"during every experiment the animal has been\r\n   deeply under the influence of an anæsthetic,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\n   _The \"Zoophilist,\" July 1899._\r\n\r\n   A revised edition has been issued, which is a stronger\r\n   indictment against the vivisectors than the original work. There\r\n   were some half-dozen omissions in the first edition concerning\r\n   the administration of anæsthetics in the preliminary operations,\r\n   but the cruelty of the experiments was in no case modified by\r\n   the fact that a whiff of chloroform was possibly administered,\r\n   as stated in the reports, at the beginning of the operation. Our\r\n   opponents may boast of their success in detecting the omission\r\n   to dot the i's and cross the t's in the first edition of the\r\n   _Nine Circles_, but there are some victories which are worse\r\n   than a defeat. We have replaced the lantern with which we\r\n   examined the dark deeds of the laboratories by the electric\r\n   searchlight. The \"researcher\" will find it hard to discover a\r\n   retreat where its rays will not follow and expose him.\r\n\r\nFor another instance of the inaccuracy of the _Zoophilist_ we have\r\nwhat it said about Professor Sanarelli's experiments in South America\r\non five human beings. Nobody defends him here. But the point is that\r\nthe _Zoophilist_ in 1899 said that they had all been killed; and in\r\n1902 admitted that they had all recovered. Or, for another instance,\r\nwe have what it said in 1902 about the case of His Majesty the King.\r\n(For these statements, see _Zoophilist_, August 1902 and September\r\n1903; also its report, October 1902, of Mr. Wood's speech at Exeter.)\r\n\r\nBut let us take a wider view. A journal, like a man, is known by the\r\ncompany that it keeps. Whose company does the _Zoophilist_ keep? Why\r\ndoes it talk of _Our excellent cotemporary, Humanity_--_Our valiant\r\ncotemporary, Le Médecine_--_Our excellent cotemporary, The Herald of\r\nthe Golden Age_? Again, among the journals that it quotes, some of\r\nthem very frequently, are the _Topical Times_, _Broad Views_, _Modern\r\nSociety_, _Madame_, the _Humanitarian_, the _Pioneer_, the\r\n_Vegetarian_, the _Voice of India_, the _Herald of Health_, the\r\n_Rock_, the _New Age_, the _Journal of Zoophily_, the _Homoeopathic\r\nWorld_, _Medical Liberty_, and the _Honolulu Humane Educator_. This\r\nmay be very good company, but it is not all of it the best company for\r\na \"scientific journal.\" Still, it may be better company than the\r\nAmerican _Medical Brief_, the _Journal de Médecine de Paris_, and the\r\nBelgian _Le Médecine_. These journals, being veritable \"medical\r\njournals,\" are quoted in the _Zoophilist_ with the most amazing\r\nfrequency and at great length; which is a compliment that they do not\r\nreceive from other medical journals. They are, indeed, as vehemently\r\nanti-Pasteur and anti-antitoxin as the _Zoophilist_ itself. Take what\r\nthe _Medical Brief_ says:--\r\n\r\n   \"Bacteriology originated in Continental Europe, where the minds\r\n   of a superstitious race were further unbalanced by constant\r\n   delving in pathology, putrefaction, and morbid anatomy. When it\r\n   spread to the new world, it also became blinded with the\r\n   revolutionary and fanatical tendencies lying near the surface in\r\n   such a civilisation.\"\r\n\r\n   \"They say if you give a calf rope enough, he will hang himself.\r\n   Bacteriology is equally clumsy and stupid.... What excuse can be\r\n   found for the cowardice and ferocious ignorance which, under\r\n   the shadow of the stars and stripes, resurrects the sentiment of\r\n   the Middle Ages to protect the fraud, seeks to rob the\r\n   individual physician of free judgment, and denounces him for\r\n   failing to use the nasty stuff?\"\r\n\r\n   \"All Continental Europe is suffering from a sort of leprosy of\r\n   decadence, mental and moral. The spiritual darkness of the\r\n   people affects all the learned professions, but more especially\r\n   medicine.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the _Medical Brief_, which the official journal of Mr.\r\nColeridge's society quotes incessantly, calling it \"an American\r\nmonthly of great ability and without a trace of the scientific bigotry\r\nand narrow-mindedness which is so prominent a feature in some of our\r\nown organs of medical opinion.\" Next we come to the _Journal de\r\nMédecine de Paris_. This is anti-Pasteur; the editor, Dr. Lutaud, came\r\nto London in 1899, and gave a lecture on \"the Pasteur superstition\" at\r\nSt. Martin's Town Hall. From a report of it in the _Star_ we may take\r\nthe following sentences:--\r\n\r\n   \"The result of the serum craze had been that the hospital was\r\n   neglected for the laboratory. Microbes of all the diseases were\r\n   found in perfectly healthy subjects. Microbes existed, but as a\r\n   consequence, not a cause. Toxins which the seropaths professed\r\n   to find were only the results of normal fermentation. The\r\n   English public had always supported him in his fifteen years'\r\n   struggle against Pasteurism.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lutaud, says the National Society, is \"the great authority.\" The\r\n_New England Anti-vivisection Monthly_ in 1900 calls him one of \"the\r\nbrightest scientists of modern times.\" His _Journal de Médecine de\r\nParis_ recalls the _Medical Brief_:--\r\n\r\n   \"To wish to apply the same methods of treatment, whether\r\n   preventive or curative, for two morbid conditions (a _wound_\r\n   with the point of entry _abnormal_ and an infectious _malady_)\r\n   in essence so different, is to commit a gross error.... The sick\r\n   are destroyed by that which cures their wounds.\"\r\n\r\nThese two \"medical journals,\" the _Medical Brief_ and the _Journal de\r\nMédecine de Paris_, are upheld by the National Society as though they\r\nwere expert witnesses of irresistible authority, and are quoted with a\r\nsort of ceaseless worship in that Society's official journal. Also it\r\nquotes the _Herald of Health_; and _Medical Liberty_, \"a monthly\r\npublication issued by the Colorado Medical Liberty League, Denver,\r\nColo., whose eloquent editor seems to be an uncompromising foe to\r\nmedical bigotry and monopoly, and humbugs of every description.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the medical journals which support the _Zoophilist_ as a\r\nscientific journal. Now let us take another point of view. Let us\r\nconsider whom the _Zoophilist_ praises, and whom it condemns. That,\r\nsurely, is a fair test of an official journal. And we get a clear\r\nresult. The late Lord Salisbury and Mr. Arthur Balfour are\r\n\"notoriously pro-vivisectionist\"; Lord Lister has \"apostatised from\r\nthe anti-septic faith\"; M. Pasteur is a \"remorseless torturer\"; the\r\nlate Mr. Lecky was \"degenerate,\" because he \"performed the\r\n_volte-face_ and went over to our opponents\"; and the late Professor\r\nVirchow was subjected to \"scathing criticism\" by one Paffrath, and was\r\nproved to be absurd. But its praises are given to a very different set\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThere is no room here to note the lighter moods of the _Zoophilist_;\r\nits jokes about cats and catacombs, and two-legged donkeys and\r\nfour-legged donkeys, and how to catch mosquitoes by putting salt on\r\ntheir tails--and it will even _break its jest on the dead_--but it\r\nrebukes another journal for levity, saying, _We regret to see our_\r\n_painful subject treated in this manner._ No room, either, for its\r\ndescription of anti-vivisectionist plays, poems, novels, and sermons.\r\nLet us, to finish with, take a few statements from its pages, almost\r\nat random; some of them are reprinted there from other sources. The\r\nsupply is endless; let us limit ourselves to six of them:--\r\n\r\n   1. \"As other bacteria (beside those of malaria) were found not\r\n   to bear sunlight or air, but to habitats in _loca scuta situ_ (?\r\n   to inhabit _loca senta situ_), in filth and noisomeness, their\r\n   habits and customs preached again the old doctrine, 'Let in sun\r\n   and air and be clean,' as earnestly as those who thought health\r\n   was due to sun and air and water and fire, the four old\r\n   elements, and act accordingly, without dissecting hecatombs of\r\n   animals to prove a thousand times over that if you boiled or\r\n   baked or drowned or freezed living creatures they would die, or\r\n   that microscopic parasites did pretty much what visible\r\n   parasites have been always known to do.\" (Loud applause)--Report\r\n   of a speech by the Bishop of Southwell (1901).\r\n\r\n   2. \"It is just as well that you should have heard what the\r\n   clever level-headed lawyer (Mr. Coleridge) thinks about this\r\n   abominable conspiracy of cruelty and fraud and impious\r\n   inquisitiveness which is called vivisection. (Cheers.) ... We\r\n   are sending out on the world in every direction multitudes of\r\n   young men who have been trained as surgeons, and they have lived\r\n   by cutting (reference here to the medical students in\r\n   _Pickwick_), and we are sending these young men out with this\r\n   _cacoëthes secandi_, this mania for cutting for the mere sake of\r\n   cutting. I should not be surprised if they tackle our noses or\r\n   our ears, and set about mutilating us in that way.\"--Archdeacon\r\n   Wilberforce (1901).\r\n\r\n   3. \"The task of the crusader against vivisection is not to\r\n   reason with the so-called scientist, not to truckle to pedants\r\n   in the schools, or palter with callous doctrinaires, but to\r\n   inform and arouse the people; and when John Bull is prodded from\r\n   his apathy, and startled from his stertorous snore, he will rise\r\n   and bellow out a veto on the elegant butcheries of pedantic\r\n   libertines, and rush full tilt with both his horns against their\r\n   abattoirs of cruelty and passion, pharisaically vaunted as\r\n   research, until the gates of hell shall not prevail against\r\n   him.\"--The Rev. Arthur Mursell (1901).[46]\r\n\r\n   4. \"It has been my experience of anti-vivisection among\r\n   Romanists, that nothing suited my purpose better than taking it\r\n   for granted that the worshippers of St. Francis, St. Bernard,\r\n   &c., must, _of course_, be on our side.\"--(1902.)\r\n\r\n   5. \"Given money, and influential patronage, the vivisector now\r\n   expects a time after his own heart, while professedly engaged in\r\n   investigating the supposed causes of cancer, or the\r\n   transmissibility of tuberculosis. He can inflict the most\r\n   horrible and prolonged tortures on miserable animals, with such\r\n   a plausible excuse in reserve, that he is endeavouring all the\r\n   while to find cures for the ailments of high personages and\r\n   millionaires.\"--(1902.)\r\n\r\n   6. \"The day of drugging and scientific butchery is drawing to a\r\n   close. Already the calm, reassuring voice of the new Life\r\n   Science, loud and clear to the few, is faintly audible to the\r\n   many. The sharp, crucial knife, with its dangerous quiver so\r\n   dear to the heart of the surgeon, the poisonous drug, will be\r\n   things of the past. Wisdom, thy paths are harmony and joy and\r\n   peace.\"--(1902.)\r\n\r\n  [46] Even the _Zoophilist_, which quotes this speech from the\r\n  _Clapham Observer_, seems to feel that it might have been put more\r\n  simply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the frequent level of the _Zoophilist_, the official journal\r\nof the National Society, edited by Mr. Berdoe, controlled by Mr.\r\nColeridge. Let us now take one more of that society's publications, a\r\npamphlet entitled _Medical Opinions on Vivisection_. Here, if\r\nanywhere, should be the society's stronghold. If it could show a large\r\nand important minority of the medical profession opposed to all\r\nexperiments on animals, its power would be greatly increased. On three\r\noccasions, many years ago, the medical profession did express its\r\nopinion. At two of the annual meetings of the British Medical\r\nAssociation, and at a meeting of the London International Medical\r\nCongress, resolutions were passed affirming the value and the\r\nnecessity of these experiments. At one of these meetings there was one\r\ndissentient vote; at one, two;[47] at one, none. These three meetings\r\nwere truly representative; they were the great meetings of the clans\r\nof the profession, from all parts of the kingdom, for a week of\r\npractical work tempered by festivities. What more could any profession\r\ndo than to go out of its way three times that it might record, in\r\nfullest assembly, its belief? And most certainly it would do the same\r\nthing again, if it thought that any further declaration were needed.\r\n\r\n  [47] I think it was two; it was either one or two.\r\n\r\nThere are in this country about 40,000 medical men. The National\r\nSociety's pamphlet quotes 39, or one in 1000. It could quote more; but\r\nwe must take what it gives us. Of these 39, we may fairly exclude\r\nProfessor Koch, Sir Frederick Treves, and the late Sir Andrew Clark,\r\nwho would certainly wish to be thus excluded. Sir Frederick Treves,\r\nwho is quoted with a sort of explanatory note, has told us in the\r\n_Times_ what he thinks of the way in which his name has been used; Sir\r\nAndrew Clark is quoted, also with an explanatory note, for an _obiter\r\ndictum_; and Professor Koch for no discoverable reason. That leaves\r\n36. Of these 36, at least 11 (probably more) are dead; one died about\r\n1838, another was born in the eighteenth century, another died more\r\nthan twenty years ago. Of the remaining 25, one is Dr. Lutaud, one is\r\nMr. Berdoe, one an American doctor, not famous over here, one a\r\nveterinary surgeon, one (I think) opposed to vaccination, and three\r\ninclined to homoeopathy; one has mistranslated Harvey to the advantage\r\nof the National Society's cause, one has written _Hints to Mothers_,\r\nand one has written _How to Keep Well_. Of these 25 gentlemen, one\r\nbelongs to a homoeopathic hospital, two to provincial hospitals, and\r\none to a hydropathic institute and a children's sanatorium; the rest\r\nof them hold no hospital or school appointment of any sort or kind. I\r\nmay be wrong over one or two of these names; but, so far as I can see,\r\nI have given an exact account of the value of these _Medical Opinions\r\non Vivisection_. And, if we take the dates of these opinions, we find\r\none in 1830, one in 1858, and seven in 1870-1880. Anyhow, what is the\r\nvalue of an opinion that all experiments on animals are _arrant and\r\nhorrible Sepoyism wearing the mask of Art and Science_?\r\n\r\nLet us leave the National Society, and turn to the Canine Defence\r\nLeague, and examine that part of its literature which is concerned\r\nwith experiments on animals. Take the following sentences from\r\npamphlets 179 and 204:--\r\n\r\n   \"Among the general public the majority are under the impression\r\n   that these so-called physiological experiments are conducted\r\n   under the influence of anæsthetics, and that the subjects are\r\n   rendered insensible to pain; this, however, is _not the case_,\r\n   and I am informed that a large proportion--considerably more\r\n   than half--of the licenses dispense with anæsthetics entirely.\r\n   The phenomena of pain are absolutely essential to any practical\r\n   issue.\"\r\n\r\n   \"All diseases have a mental or spiritual origin. Upon this\r\n   subject a large treatise might be written. I have carefully\r\n   thought this matter over, and can come to no other conclusion.\r\n   Can we imagine any wild bird confined to its nest with\r\n   rheumatism, or neuralgia, or consumption, or asthma, or any\r\n   other affection whatever? I believe them all to be entirely free\r\n   from disease; that is, all which have retained their freedom,\r\n   and thus have not come under the baneful influence of man. Take,\r\n   again, the fishes, and ask whether any fisherman ever caught a\r\n   fish found to be diseased. This subject is an interesting,\r\n   though a somewhat melancholy one.\"\r\n\r\nNext, as an example of the literature of the London Society, let us\r\ntake a speech made at St. James's Hall, May 26, 1903, by Dr. Hadwen,\r\nof Gloucester, who is also vehemently opposed to vaccination. He\r\nand Lieutenant-General Phelps, at the time of the disastrous\r\nsmallpox epidemic in Gloucester in 1896, were leaders of the\r\nanti-vaccinationists. It would be easy to give other instances of the\r\nsympathy between anti-vivisection and anti-vaccination. But our\r\nbusiness is not with Dr. Hadwen at Gloucester, but with him at St.\r\nJames's Hall. He says to the London Society:--\r\n\r\n   \"We are told we must pay attention to what the experts tell us.\r\n   My opinion is this: If there is one person in the whole of God's\r\n   creation that wants looking after, it is the expert.\r\n   (Laughter.)\"\r\n\r\nOf the House of Commons, he says:--\r\n\r\n   \"If there is one thing in the world that will move a member of\r\n   Parliament, it is to know that any particular policy will carry\r\n   votes along with it. (Hear, hear.) You can bring any member of\r\n   Parliament to your knees as long as you show him that he has\r\n   his constituency at his back; and with all due respect to our\r\n   noble chairman, I am bound to say that my experience of members\r\n   of Parliament is this--that their consciences go as far as\r\n   votes, and do not extend very much farther.\" (Laughter and\r\n   applause.)\r\n\r\nHe describes an imaginary experiment under curare, and is interrupted\r\nby a cry of \"Demons!\" He goes on:--\r\n\r\n   \"Yes, madam, they are demons. (Applause.) I know no other word\r\n   to describe experimenters who can submit sentient and sensitive\r\n   creatures, almost human in intelligence and faith, to diabolical\r\n   experiments, whilst their victims are rendered helpless and\r\n   voiceless by a hellish drug. (Applause.) I cannot understand how\r\n   in a land like this, that boasts of her Christianity and of her\r\n   liberty, men, women, clergy, and politicians can allow this\r\n   cowardly science to stand before us, and this demoniacal work to\r\n   be carried on. (Loud cheers.)\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now seen something of the style of the literature of these\r\nSocieties; and, in the next chapter, we will consider its arguments. I\r\ndo not deny that its style is sometimes at a higher level than the\r\nexamples which I have quoted. But I do say that I could fill a book of\r\n100 pages with quotations from journals or pamphlets of the last few\r\nyears, all of them on the lower level. And in this chapter I have\r\npractically quoted nobody but those who are the leaders of the\r\nopposition to all experiments on animals. The official journal of this\r\nSociety, the annual report of that Society, the leaflets which are\r\nsent in answer to a formal request for literature--I have quoted\r\nthese, as they came to hand, just going through them and marking those\r\npassages which were to my purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ARGUMENTS\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the societies arose out of the Act, and not the Act\r\nout of them; that they are divided or hostile; and that they have next\r\nto nothing to show for all the vast sums which they have received.\r\nAlso we have noted the style of literature which they send broadcast\r\nover the country; and the \"medical journals\" and \"medical opinions\"\r\nthat are in favour of the cause; and the general tone and frequent\r\nlevel of the official journal of the National Society. Still, a good\r\ncause may be ill served; nobody minds, after all, the style of a\r\nthing, so long as it is true. Let us come to the heart of the matter.\r\nWhat is the nature of the arguments and evidences of these societies?\r\nThey desire to bring about the absolute prohibition, as a criminal\r\noffence, of all experiments on animals. By what facts, what records,\r\nwhat statistics, do they maintain this attempt to mend or end the\r\npresent Act?\r\n\r\nHere, at the risk of repetition, let me make quite clear what they are\r\nfighting against. Nine out of ten experiments are bacteriological.\r\nThat is to say, 90 or 95 per cent. Of these inoculations, more than a\r\nthird are made in the direct service of the national health, and as it\r\nwere by the direct orders of Government. A vast number of them are\r\nwholly painless; nothing happens; the result is negative; the thing\r\ndoes not take. Some are followed by disease, and the animal is\r\npainlessly killed at the first manifestation of the disease, or\r\nrecovers, or dies of the disease. The fate of that animal is the fate\r\nof all of us; it has got to die of something, and it dies of it.\r\nAnyhow, the talk about torture-troughs and cutting-up has no place\r\nhere; and the word vivisection, by a gross and palpable abuse, is\r\nfalse nine times out of every ten. Of the remaining 10 per cent. of\r\nall experiments; in those that are made under the License alone, or\r\nunder the License _plus_ Certificate C, the question of pain does not\r\narise. The animal is anæsthetised, and is killed under that\r\nanæsthetic. The remaining 3 per cent. of all experiments are those\r\nthat are made under the License _plus_ Certificate B (or B + EE, or B\r\n+ F). The initial operation is done under the anæsthetic; the animal\r\nis allowed to recover; it may be, practically, none the worse for it.\r\nOr it may be the worse for it, and therefore die, or be killed. But\r\nCertificate B is _not_ allowed for any infliction of pain on the\r\nanimal through the operation wound, and never will be.\r\n\r\nHere are two sets of experiments: those under Certificate A, and those\r\nunder Certificate B. One is 90 per cent. of all experiments; the other\r\nis 3 per cent. Nine out of ten experiments are inoculations, and the\r\noperation of the tenth is done under an anæsthetic. That is the first\r\nfact, which we must fix in our minds, before we consider the arguments\r\nof the societies.\r\n\r\nNext, the dates and the sources of their evidence. They wish to stop\r\nthe experiments that are now made in this country. They are bound,\r\ntherefore, to produce \"up-to-date\" evidence, and from home sources;\r\nnot that which is thirty years old, or comes from sources far away.\r\nThis present use of animals, here and now, under the restrictions of\r\nthe Act, is what they are fighting; they are bound to draw their\r\ninstances from here and now.\r\n\r\nBut this would not suit them at all: they could not bear to be thus\r\nlimited to here and now. Their arguments and their instances extend\r\nover thirty or more years, and are drawn from all parts of the world,\r\nfrom the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Italy,\r\nfrom every country. Journals of Physiology, text-books, reports,\r\nmedical journals, British and foreign, are ransacked to find evidence\r\nfor the cause; there is a regular system, year in year out, a sort of\r\nsecret service or detective force, a persistent hunting-up of all\r\nscraps and shreds of evidence. One society advertised, in a daily\r\npaper, that it wanted confidential communications, from medical\r\nstudents, as to the practices of the laboratory. Another, seeing the\r\nchance of a prosecution, says, \"Special inquiries were made on the\r\nsubject, and the society's solicitor went to Belfast to conduct these\r\ninquiries on the spot.\" All this espionage is sure now and again, in\r\nthirty years, to detect something which it can magnify into a scandal.\r\nAnd when a fault is found, even a little one, oh the joy in the ranks\r\nof the societies. And, at once, the fault, exaggerated, and highly\r\ncoloured, is made a _locus classicus_, a commonplace of every\r\ndrawing-room meeting. What is the date of it, what was the place of\r\nit? Was it long ago, was it far from here? Still, never let it drop;\r\nwhat one did then, they are all doing now, all of them of malice\r\nprepense; let us proclaim the blessed news from every platform; and\r\nplease remember us in your Wills.\r\n\r\nAmong the arguments against all experiments on animals, is this very\r\ncommon argument, that the truth about them is too horrible to be told.\r\n\"We dare not produce our brief,\" says the Rev. Nevison Loraine, at the\r\nannual meeting of the London Society in 1901; \"it is only the courage\r\nof a lady that dares to produce tales so harrowing as those that have\r\nbeen briefly alluded to to-day; and it is part of the weakness of our\r\ncause with the public that we cannot tell the whole story.\" But, not\r\nlong ago, the courage of two ladies, officers of a Swedish\r\nAnti-vivisection Society, honorary members of Mr. Coleridge's society,\r\ndid produce a book full of harrowing tales; they told the whole story\r\nto the Lord Chief Justice and a jury. Was not that producing their\r\nbrief? _I have here in my pocket something I have not got the nerve to\r\nread to you_, says Archdeacon Wilberforce, at the annual meeting of\r\nthe National Society in 1901; and the next minute a lady in the\r\naudience is crying out, _Do not go on, we cannot bear it_; and he\r\nsays, _You have got to bear it. Good God, they have got to suffer it._\r\nIs not that producing his brief? Mr. Coleridge, in 1902, sends out\r\n12,000 copies, just to begin with, of an illustrated German catalogue\r\nof laboratory instruments: _The question of thus scattering abroad\r\nthis fearful document has been the subject of very grave\r\nconsideration.... We have launched upon the world this terrible proof\r\nof what vivisection really is, with a full sense of our\r\nresponsibility._ Is not that producing his brief? These things in the\r\npocket, and fearful documents, and briefs that Mr. Loraine dares not\r\nproduce, are apt to say little or nothing about anæsthetics, and to be\r\nsilent over the fact that nine out of every ten experiments are\r\nbacteriological, and to over-emphasise experiments made many years ago\r\nor a thousand miles away. You bring the speaker down to now and here,\r\nto the text of the Act, to the reports to Government, to the Home\r\nSecretary's own words in Parliament; and you are told that they are\r\nall in a conspiracy, all liars more or less, and that the truth is in\r\nthe societies, especially in one of them. Or you bring him down to the\r\ngood that these experiments have done, the lives that they have\r\nsaved; and at once he is off like the wind:--\r\n\r\n   \"The society does not concern itself with the results of\r\n   vivisection, whether good or bad, and thinks it is beside the\r\n   mark to discuss them.\" (Report of the Canine Defence League,\r\n   1903.)\r\n\r\n   \"When the angel of pity is driven from the heart; when the\r\n   fountain of tears is dry, the soul becomes a serpent crawling in\r\n   the dust of the desert.\" (Colonel Ingersoll.)\r\n\r\n   \"I make no pretence to criticise vivisectional experiments on\r\n   the ground of their technical failure or success. I dogmatically\r\n   postulate humaneness as a condition of worthy personal\r\n   character.\" (Mr. Bernard Shaw.)\r\n\r\n   \"The vivisector, when he stands over his animal, whether with\r\n   anæsthetics or without anæsthetics, is creating, even if the\r\n   physical health of the nation is enhanced by it, a moral shroud\r\n   not only for himself, but a moral shroud the edges of which are\r\n   continually extending into the thought atmosphere, and so\r\n   deadening the national conscience at large.\" (Mr. Herbert\r\n   Burrows.)\r\n\r\n   \"The developed taste for blood and cruelty must in the end find\r\n   its full satisfaction in the vivisection of human beings when\r\n   they have the misfortune to come under the power of our future\r\n   doctors.\" (Bishop Bagshawe.)\r\n\r\nHere, in these five sentences taken merely out of the heap, is the\r\nethical argument; so facile, so pleasant to self, so confident of a\r\ngood hearing. No wonder that the societies, now that the facts of\r\nscience are too strong for them, are falling back on the facts of\r\nethics. In the beginning, thirty years ago, they were created out of\r\nethics; they were born auspiciously. What a welcome they had! Tennyson\r\nand Browning and Ruskin, Westcott and Martineau, the late Lord\r\nShaftesbury, and her Majesty the late Queen--these all, and many\r\nmore, among whom were some of the best men and women of the Victorian\r\nAge, were their friends. There never was a cause that enjoyed a better\r\nsend-off. Everything was in its favour. Magendie and Schiff and\r\nMantegazza had made people sick of experiments on animals. The\r\nadvocates of the method had not very much to show on its behalf; no\r\nbacteriology, save as a far-off vision; no great discoveries lately in\r\nphysiology or pathology. Thirty years ago, good and true men fought a\r\nway for the Act; and there are few now who think the worse of them for\r\nit, or grudge them that victory. But, though ethics may be the same\r\nalways, yet the arguments from them are not. The ethical argument\r\nnow--we try to find it, and it takes all shapes, and vanishes in a\r\ncloud of foul language. That text about the sparrows, which is never\r\nquoted in full; that fear about the vivisection of hospital patients;\r\nand all that nonsense about moral shrouds, and serpents in the desert,\r\nand developed tastes for blood; and Mr. Bernard Shaw, who on May 22nd,\r\n1900, suggests to the National Society that \"_the laceration of living\r\nflesh quickens the blood of the vivisector as the blood of the hunter,\r\nthe debauchee, or the beast of prey is undoubtedly quickened in such\r\nways_,\"[48] and a week later, before the London Society, dogmatically\r\npostulates humaneness as a condition of worthy personal character; and\r\nthe lady who says, _Oh, Pharisees and hypocrites! Oh, cruel and\r\nruthless egotists!_ and the Falstaff's army of the osteopath, and the\r\nfruitarian, and the _anti_ this, that, and the other, who follow the\r\ncause; and all these discordant societies, and the begging for\r\nmoney--where, in all this confusion, can we find the ethical argument?\r\nMercy is admirable, but I will wait till mercy and truth are met\r\ntogether. Let us leave the societies to their ethics, and see what\r\nthey have to say for themselves in the lower realms of science.\r\n\r\n  [48] Mr. R. B. Cunninghame-Graham's variant on this theme, in the\r\n  _Daily News_, Aug. 27, 1903, is really too filthy to be put here.\r\n  Like Mr. Loraine, I dare not produce my brief.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFirst, there are the general arguments. That experiments on animals\r\nare useless, or of very little use; that they contradict each other;\r\nthat you cannot argue from animals to men, or from an animal under\r\nexperiment to a man not under experiment; that the discoveries made by\r\nthe help of experiments on animals might have been made as well, or\r\nbetter, without that help; that the way to advance medicine and\r\nsurgery has been, and is, and always will be, not by experiments on\r\nanimals, but by clinical and _post-mortem_ studies. These and the like\r\narguments we may call general; they are the complement of the horrible\r\nstories and magic-lantern slides of the itinerant lecturer.\r\n\r\n1. The vague statement that these experiments are of little use, may\r\nbe answered in several ways. It does not come well from those who say\r\nthat the question is ethical, not utilitarian; who neither know, nor\r\ncare, nor are agreed, what is the real value of these experiments. \"I\r\nchallenge you,\" says one, \"to show me what good they have done.\"\r\nAnother says, \"I admit that they may perhaps have done a little good;\r\nbut so little; they are a bad investment; you would get a better\r\nreturn from other methods of work.\" Another says, \"I don't care\r\nwhether they have or have not done good; this is a matter of\r\nconscience; we must not do evil that good may come; I grant all, or\r\nnearly all, your instances--malaria, and diphtheria, and cerebral\r\nlocalisation, and so forth; but the question is a moral question, and\r\nwe must not inflict pain on animals, save for their own good.\"\r\nProbably the best answer is, that good has indeed come, and is coming,\r\nand so far as we can see will come, out of these experiments; that the\r\ninstances given are indeed true; that these results were won out of\r\nmany failures, and contradictions, and fallacies, and harkings-back;\r\nand that they have stood the test of time, and will underlie all\r\nbetter results, all surer methods, that shall take their place.\r\n\r\n2. The statement that \"you cannot argue from animals to man\" is not\r\ntrue. Why should it be? Take tubercle, tetanus, or rabies. The\r\ntubercle-bacillus is the same thing in a man, a test-tube, or a\r\nguinea-pig; the virus of rabies is transmitted from dogs to men;\r\noysters harbour typhoid, fleas carry the plague, diverse mosquitoes\r\ncarry malaria, yellow fever, filariasis, and dengue. Take the\r\ncirculation of the blood, the nature and action of the motor centres\r\nof the brain, the vaso-motor nerves, the excretory organs, the\r\ncontractility of muscle, the blood-changes in respiration--where are\r\nthe differences to support this statement that you cannot argue from\r\nanimals to men?\r\n\r\n3. The twin statements, that all the results got by the help of\r\nexperiments might have been got some other way, and that clinical\r\nstudy and _post-mortem_ study are infinitely more fruitful than\r\nexperimental study, may be taken together. We are told that anybody\r\ncould have discovered the circulation by injecting the vessels of a\r\ndead body. Well, Malpighi tried to discover the capillaries by this\r\nmethod, and failed. We are asked to admit that phrenology, long\r\nbefore physiology, discovered the truth about the surface of the\r\nbrain; _I have been told_, says Mr. Coleridge at an annual meeting of\r\nhis society, _that the physiologists can now triumphantly map out the\r\nhuman brain. I think the phrenologists have always been able to do\r\nthat, and whether they or the vivisectors do it best does not much\r\nmatter._ We are told that the use of thyroid extract could have been\r\ndiscovered right away by mere chemistry and thinking. We hear of a\r\nproposal for a bacteriological laboratory on anti-vivisectionist\r\nprinciples, where no inoculations shall be made. This argument, that\r\nthe whole thing might have been done some other way, must repair its\r\nwit, and find better instances. Then comes the incessant appeal:\r\n\"Stick to clinical work; study diseases at the bedside, in the\r\n_post-mortem_ room, in the museum, anywhere but in the laboratory. The\r\nHospital taught you to neglect these methods; it made experiments on\r\nits patients, it cheated the public, it sheltered malignant cruelty in\r\nits most repulsive form under illustrious patronage. Set aside\r\npathology; just sit by your patients long enough; that is the way of\r\ndiscovery.\"\r\n\r\nOr the appeal takes another tone: \"Stick to sanitation. If only\r\neverybody were healthy, everybody would be well. Diseases are due to\r\ndirt, to vice, to overcrowding, to want of common-sense. Abolish all\r\nslums, disinfect all mankind, body and soul, make every house clean\r\nand wholesome, no bad drainage, or ventilation, or water, or food.\r\nLeave your torture-chambers, and open your eyes to the blessed truth\r\nthat, if everybody were healthy, and everybody were good, everybody\r\nwould be well.\" What is the use of talking in this way? Suppose that\r\nall the physiologists suddenly rushed into practice, and all the\r\nbacteriologists were turned into medical officers of health. What\r\nwould be gained? What difference would it make? The physiologists, of\r\ncourse, would merely vivisect their hospital patients; and the\r\nbacteriologists would hardly feel the change, for many of them are\r\nmedical officers of health already, public servants, appointed by the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThis argument, that practice is fruitful of discoveries, and science\r\nis barren of them, reaches its highest absurdity in the National\r\nSociety's official journal; which praises extravagantly those methods\r\nof practice which were not discovered by the help of experiments on\r\nanimals; praises them without experience, criticism, or understanding.\r\nIt finds a statement, in the _Medical Annual_, that a year has passed\r\nwithout any great improvement in practice; and at once it lays the\r\nblame not on practice but on science. It fights hard against a fact\r\nwhich began in science, though it has been proved a thousand times\r\nover in practice. It accuses the bacteriologists now of caring nothing\r\nfor human suffering, now of rushing after every new method of\r\ntreatment and flooding the market with drugs. _There is money in the\r\nbusiness_--that is the phrase of the _Zoophilist_. But there is money,\r\nalso, in the anti-vivisection business. _If you can provide for the\r\nsociety's future in your will, may we beg of you to do so? If you\r\nagree, pray do it now_, says the London Society: _this is the most\r\nalive humane organisation in the world_. But the National Society\r\nsays, _A grave injury is done to the cause of mercy by the deplorable\r\nwaste of money spent in perfectly unnecessary offices and salaries. We\r\nsay that one office would amply suffice for all the work, and that one\r\noffice would not need half-a-dozen paid secretaries._\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLet us leave the general arguments and come to the special arguments.\r\nSome of them are concerned with the experiments themselves, some with\r\nthe men who made them, some with the administration of the Act. These\r\nspecial arguments must be arranged in some sort of order; but they\r\ncross and recross, and are of diverse natures, and any attempt at\r\nstrict arrangement would fail. That the arrangement may be useful for\r\nimmediate reference, and may help anybody to answer statements made at\r\ndebates and lectures, a separate heading has been given to each\r\nargument. Those arguments are put first which are concerned with the\r\nexperiments themselves, or with the men who made them; afterward come\r\nthose which are concerned with the administration of the Act.\r\n\r\nHARVEY\r\n\r\n\"It is perfectly true,\" says Mr. Berdoe, \"that Harvey again and again,\r\nin the plainest terms, declares that his experiments on living animals\r\naided him in his discoveries.\" I agree here with Mr. Berdoe. Then\r\ncomes this sentence: _But that is not so important as it appears to\r\nbe_. Why not? What is gained by this attempt to explain Harvey away?\r\nDr. Bowie mistranslates him; Dr. Abiathar Wall half-quotes him; Mr.\r\nAdams says that Harvey did not ascribe his discoveries to experiments\r\non animals; Mr. Berdoe says that he did; and Mr. Berdoe's society\r\nwithdraws every pamphlet that involves acceptance of Dr. Bowie's\r\nmistranslation. Why should we take, on Harvey's work, any opinion but\r\nthat of Harvey?\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES BELL\r\n\r\nFor the argument from Sir Charles Bell's words, and for the truth\r\nabout his work, see Part I., Chap. VII.\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL LOCALISATION\r\n\r\nMr. Berdoe says that it is \"pure nonsense\" to argue from the motor\r\nareas of a monkey's brain to those of a man's brain. Why is it\r\nnonsense? What is the difference between the movement of a group of\r\nmuscles in a monkey's arm and the same movement of the same group of\r\nmuscles in a man's arm? With a very weak current, so weak that it is\r\nnot diffused beyond the area where it is applied, the surface of a\r\nmonkey's brain is stimulated at one spot; and forthwith its opposite\r\narm is flexed, or its opposite leg is drawn up, or whatever the\r\nmovement may be, according to the spot. A man has some disease, acute\r\nor chronic, of his brain; and, as the disease advances, twitchings\r\noccur in one arm or one leg, little irrational useless movements, or\r\nrigidity, or loss of power, according to the case. Is it pure nonsense\r\nto believe that the disease has reached a certain spot on the surface\r\nof his brain? There is no question here of the mental differences\r\nbetween men and monkeys; no question of consciousness or of will. But\r\nDr. Holländer, who thinks very highly of Gall's system of phrenology,\r\nsays, _Is the laboratory-man, the experimental physiologist, to teach\r\nus the mental functions of the brain from his experiments on frogs,\r\npigeons, rabbits, dogs, cats, and monkeys?_ That is the argument; that\r\nwe must not compare the monkey's motor areas with the man's motor\r\nareas, for we cannot find the mind of a man in the brain of a frog.\r\n\r\nBut, putting aside phrenology, which is a broken reed for\r\nanti-vivisection to lean on, what other arguments are urged against\r\nthe facts of cerebral localisation? First, that the speech-centres\r\nwere discovered without the help of experiments on animals. That is\r\ntrue; and there, practically, the work of discovery stopped, till\r\nexperiments on animals were made. Next, that the physiologists have\r\nnot always been agreed as to the facts of cerebral localisation; that\r\nCharcot doubted them, that Goltz criticised Munk, and so on. What is\r\nthe date of these doubts and criticisms? They are twenty years old.\r\nNext, that the surgery of the brain often fails to save life. That is\r\ntrue; and the anti-vivisection societies make frequent use of this\r\nfact. But they are unable to suggest any better method. Mr. Berdoe\r\ntells us that he cannot remember hearing, in his student days,\r\nanything about brain-experiments on animals:--\r\n\r\n   \"Our work was to observe as closely as possible the symptoms and\r\n   physical signs exhibited by patients in the hospital wards who\r\n   suffered from any form of nerve or brain disease, and having\r\n   carefully noted them in our case-books, to avail ourselves, when\r\n   the patient died, of any opportunity that was offered us in the\r\n   _post-mortem_ of correcting our diagnosis.\"\r\n\r\nThat is an exact picture of the state of things thirty years ago; the\r\nstudent taking notes, waiting for the _post-mortem_ examination, then\r\ncorrecting his notes there, etc. Every case of brain-tumour in those\r\ndays died, but many are saved now; and every case of brain-abscess in\r\nthose days died (one or two were saved by a sort of miracle of\r\nsurgical audacity); but many are saved now.\r\n\r\nANTITOXINS AND CARBOLIC ACID\r\n\r\nIt is said by opponents of experiments on animals, that the active\r\nprinciple, in antitoxin, is not the antitoxin, but the carbolic acid\r\nwhich is added to it. They take this statement from the _Medical\r\nBrief_; and we have learned something of the style of that journal.\r\nHere is a sentence from the official journal of the National\r\nSociety:--\r\n\r\n   \"The _Medical Brief_ calls antitoxin 'the fraud of the age,' and\r\n   says: _Would that physicians could all realise the hideous\r\n   horror of using this nasty stuff as a remedial agent_. It would\r\n   be nothing less than ghoulishness to inject the matter from an\r\n   abscess into a child's arm, yet antitoxin is not much better; it\r\n   is the decomposing fluid from a diseased horse, partially\r\n   neutralised by carbolic acid.\"\r\n\r\nFor a commentary on this sentence, take the following letter from an\r\neminent bacteriologist:--\r\n\r\n   \"As regards diphtheria antitoxin, the addition of an antiseptic\r\n   is by no means necessary or universal. For fully two years I\r\n   added none to the serum which I prepared, but contented myself\r\n   with filtration through a Kieselguhr filter, and bottling under\r\n   aseptic conditions. At one time Roux used to put a small piece\r\n   of camphor in each bottle as some sort of safeguard against\r\n   putrefaction. Nowadays I believe that most makers preserve their\r\n   sera by adding a trace of trikresol--I am not quite sure of the\r\n   amount, but it is either .04 per cent. or .004 per cent.!\"\r\n\r\nBut it is probable that the _Zoophilist_ will still accept the\r\nauthority of the _Medical Brief_. Baccelli got good results, in\r\ntetanus, from the administration of carbolic acid; therefore, in\r\ndiphtheria, the good results from diphtheria-antitoxin are due to the\r\ncarbolic acid in it. That is the argument. But there is no carbolic\r\nacid in it? Oh, then the patient got well of himself, the treatment\r\ndidn't kill him, it was not diphtheria after all, the disease has\r\naltered its type lately, he was well nursed, the back of his throat\r\nwas painted with something, the doctor got half-a-crown by calling it\r\ndiphtheria, the bacillus diphtheriæ may be found in healthy mouths,\r\nand all bacteriology is _base and blatant materialism_.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM THE DEATH-RATE\r\n\r\nThere is another argument against diphtheria-antitoxin; we may call\r\nit, for brevity, the death-rate argument. It is this. _The doctors say\r\nthat the antitoxin does save lives; they give us statistics from every\r\npart of the world. But, if it saves lives, then the total mortality\r\nought to go down. But the Registrar-General's returns do not go down;\r\nindeed, they tend to go up. Therefore diphtheria-antitoxin is useless,\r\nor worse than useless._ By this kind of logic, umbrellas are useless.\r\nIf they were useful, then the more umbrellas there were, the less rain\r\nthere would be. But the increase in umbrellas coincides with a\r\npositive increase of rain. Therefore umbrellas are useless, or worse\r\nthan useless.\r\n\r\nDespite the absurdity of this argument, Mr. Coleridge and Mr.\r\nSomerville Wood, the National Society's lecturer, have worked hard\r\nwith it; Mr. Coleridge in the press, Mr. Wood on the platform. Surely\r\nthis confusion between the total mortality and the case-mortality of\r\nan epidemic disease is a very serious offence. That there may be no\r\ndoubt of the confusion, let us consider a set of quotations, out of a\r\ncorrespondence published in September-October 1902, between G. P.,\r\nwhose initials we may take to mean general practitioner, and Mr.\r\nSomerville Wood. This correspondence is a good instance of the\r\nargument in its usual form:--\r\n\r\n   G. P.: \"The antitoxin treatment of diphtheria has lessened the\r\n   mortality from that disease by nearly 50 per cent. In the\r\n   hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board the average\r\n   case-mortality for the last five years of the pre-antitoxin\r\n   period, _i.e._ previous to 1895, was 30.6; that for 1895 and the\r\n   successive four years was 18.1, the successive figures being\r\n   22.8, 21.2, 17.7, 15.4, and 13.6, the mortality steadily falling\r\n   with increased familiarity with the use of the remedy. This has\r\n   not been the result of a diminished virulence of the disease, as\r\n   similar experience has been gained all over the world. The\r\n   figures for Chicago are even more striking, as the averages are\r\n   35.0 and 6.79 for the pre-and the post-antitoxin periods\r\n   respectively.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. WOOD: \"Nowadays, almost every sore throat is called\r\n   diphtheritic, antitoxin is given, and wonderful statistics are\r\n   formulated to bolster up the latest medical craze. The real test\r\n   is whether the introduction of antitoxin has lowered the\r\n   death-rate generally from diphtheria. Here are the\r\n   Registrar-General's figures: In 1887, the death-rate from\r\n   diphtheria per million persons in this country was 140. In 1897,\r\n   after the treatment had been used several years, the death-rate\r\n   from this disease increased to 246 per million.\"\r\n\r\n   G. P.: \"Mr. Wood's statistics do not vitiate my argument in the\r\n   very slightest. His selected figures, using the lowest rate\r\n   since 1881, merely show that diphtheria as a whole was more\r\n   prevalent in 1897 than in 1887. He cannot and does not attack\r\n   the statement that the case-mortality has been lessened where\r\n   antitoxin has been used, and his test is no test at all.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. WOOD: \"Let me give the annual death-rate from diphtheria to\r\n   a million living persons from 1881 to 1900, taken from the\r\n   Registrar-General's returns.\" (Gives them.)\r\n\r\n   G. P.: \"One last word in answer to Mr. Wood. I repeat that his\r\n   figures show nothing more than the accepted fact that diphtheria\r\n   as a whole has been increasing for the last 30 years. This has\r\n   no bearing at all on the also accepted fact that where antitoxin\r\n   is used the mortality is lessened, and Mr. Wood has not, in\r\n   fact, denied this. His confusion of total mortality and\r\n   case-mortality only shows that he does not understand the\r\n   elementary principles of statistics.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, at the _Bournbrook and Selly Oak Social Club_, Mr.\r\nWood gives his \"thrilling lecture, with lantern views,\" _Behind the\r\nClosed Doors of the Laboratory_: one of his stock lectures. In it, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n   \"The proof of the pudding was in the eating. In 1881 the\r\n   death-rate from diphtheria was 127 per million; in 1900 it was\r\n   290 per million. He had but to state that the antitoxin\r\n   treatment was introduced about 1894.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later, at an _overflowingly-attended Citizen Social_ at\r\nBirkenhead:--\r\n\r\n   \"The proof of the pudding lay in the eating. In 1881 in each\r\n   million of the population 121 persons died from diphtheria,\r\n   while in 1900 the mortality from the same disease was 290\r\n   persons in each million of the population, and the antitoxin\r\n   treatment was introduced in 1894.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, at Ipswich, the same thing. This time, he is\r\nchallenged by letters in the _East Anglian Daily Times_, and again\r\nquotes the Registrar-General.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, at the _Hyde Labour Church_: the _Closed Doors of\r\nthe Laboratory_ again:--\r\n\r\n   \"He found from the Registrar-General's returns that the\r\n   death-rate had gone up in cases in which they were told that\r\n   wonderful things had been done by experiments on living\r\n   animals. If a lower death-rate could be shown, then the\r\n   vivisectionists might have something to go upon; but they could\r\n   not show a lower death-rate.\"\r\n\r\nThat was in January 1903. In December 1903, Mr. Wood is still using\r\nthe same argument; this time it is a lecture at Ashton on _Vivisection\r\nand the Hospitals_:\r\n\r\n   \"Again and again had they defied the so-called scientific world\r\n   to put their finger on the Registrar-General's returns, and show\r\n   them a single instance where the death-rate had been lowered by\r\n   vivisection, and they had not been able to do it. On the\r\n   contrary, he found that the death-rate had gone up in the last\r\n   20 years, despite the thousands of animals that had been\r\n   experimented upon. The death-rate in diphtheria was 100 per\r\n   million more than it was in 1878.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wood in the provinces, and Mr. Coleridge in the papers, have used\r\nthis argument hard. Let us look at it well. It has been refuted again\r\nand again. Take a thousand cases of diphtheria from any civilised part\r\nof the world, in the days before antitoxin; how many of them died?\r\nTake a thousand cases now, treated with antitoxin; how many of them\r\ndie? Why do Mr. Wood and Mr. Coleridge run away from that easy\r\nquestion? There is nothing unfair in it; they have all the reports\r\nbefore them; they know the facts well. We do not find any evidence\r\nthat they are willing to acknowledge the truth of those facts. Follow\r\nMr. Somerville Wood, from place to place, with his magic-lantern and\r\nhis stock of lectures. The lantern-pictures are many of them taken\r\nfrom foreign sources, and some of them are of great age; but they\r\ninclude a portrait of Mr. Coleridge, and some comic slides to be shown\r\nat the end of the lecture, rabbits vivisecting a professor, and so\r\nforth. Certainly, he works hard; 95 lectures in one year; _we cannot\r\nbetter employ the funds at our disposal than in sending well-informed\r\nlecturers to every city in the kingdom to rouse the just indignation\r\nof the people_. The year after that, 74 lectures; _on two occasions he\r\nhas spoken when unsupported to over 1000 people, and an audience of\r\nseveral hundreds is quite the rule_. Here he is at Windsor, with\r\nBishop Barry in the chair, and he says to them:--\r\n\r\n   \"Unhappily, Pasteur left his microscope and chemicals and took\r\n   up the vivisectionist's knife. In that he got utterly astray and\r\n   became nothing more than a mere quack.\"\r\n\r\nHere, with a different audience, at the Mechanics' Lecture Hall,\r\nNottingham, giving his lantern-lecture on _Pasteurism_ to a _most\r\nrespectable audience of working men, their wives, sons, and daughters,\r\nand in many cases children_.\r\n\r\n   \"The thesis he set out to elaborate and maintain was that\r\n   Pasteurism produces hydrophobia rather than cures it; that\r\n   vivisection under any circumstances is both cruel and immoral;\r\n   and that with special reference to bacterial toxicology and the\r\n   treatment by inoculation, the preparation of toxins by the\r\n   Pasteur methods was the most horrible form of repulsive quackery\r\n   and hideous cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nHere he is at Birmingham, asking for money, and hinting that, unless\r\nall experiments on animals are stopped, _the poor will be the ultimate\r\nvictims_. Here, at Gloucester, saying that _it is silly to experiment\r\nat all_, and that he is not going to take his views as to right and\r\nwrong from any man of science, however learned he may be. Here, at\r\nEdinburgh, with the _Closed Doors_ again, and the picture of the\r\nrabbit \"roasted alive\": three grains of opium, he tells them, would be\r\nenough to kill the strongest navvy in Edinburgh, but 16 grains can be\r\nadministered to a pigeon; and the death-rate has gone up every year\r\nin spite of vivisection. Here, at a drawing-room meeting, asking for\r\nmoney; here, at a garden party, with a _considerable number of persons\r\nranging themselves on the grass_, and he tells them that they have on\r\ntheir side all that is best in every department of public life; here,\r\nat Blackburn, with the _Closed Doors_ again, calling the law _a sham\r\nand a farce_; here, at Cheltenham, with Bishop Mitchinson in the\r\nchair, still quoting the Registrar-General, and saying that _he does\r\nnot think the outlook was ever more promising than it is to-day_. All\r\nover the kingdom, he and his magic-lantern, year after year, goes Mr.\r\nWood. He is a fluent speaker; he has things in his pocket; they are\r\nbrought out, if you contradict him; or he \"challenges\" you, or\r\nexplains you away, or says that you \"are not quite playing the game.\"\r\nLet him alone; to-morrow he will pack up his lantern, and be gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleridge, in his use of the death-rate argument, carries it even\r\nfurther than Mr. Wood; for he applies it over a wider range. \"Look at\r\nmyxoedema,\" he says; \"the doctors tell us that they can cure it with\r\nthyroid extract, and that the use of thyroid extract was discovered by\r\nthe help of experiments on animals. Very good. Myxoedema is due to\r\nsome fault in the thyroid gland. Very good. But here are the\r\nRegistrar-General's returns of the annual death-rate for all diseases\r\nof that gland. See, the death-rate has gone up, steadily, during the\r\nlast 20 years.\" Was there ever such an argument? It is only of late\r\nyears that myxoedema has been generally recognised. Till it was\r\nrecognised, it was not diagnosed; till it was diagnosed, it was not\r\nreturned as a cause of death. Again, there are many other diseases of\r\nthe thyroid gland, including various forms of malignant disease. It is\r\ncancer of the thyroid gland that decides the death-rate. The number\r\nof deaths from myxoedema, especially since the discovery of thyroid\r\nextract, must be small indeed. Moreover, apart from Mr. Coleridge's\r\nfallacy of argument, it is impossible to see how he can really doubt\r\nthe efficacy of the thyroid treatment, both in myxoedema and in\r\nsporadic cretinism.\r\n\r\nAgain, \"Look at the diseases of the circulation,\" he says. \"The\r\ndoctors say that digitalis and nitrite of amyl act on the heart; and\r\nthat the action of these drugs was discovered by the help of\r\nexperiments on animals. Very good. The heart is concerned with the\r\ncirculation. Very good. But here are the Registrar-General's returns\r\nof the annual death-rate for all diseases of the circulation. See how\r\nit has gone up, from 1371 per million persons in 1881 to 1709 in 1900.\r\nTherefore, either these two drugs are never used, or they are useless,\r\nor the Registrar-General's returns are false.\" It is impossible to\r\nunderstand how Mr. Coleridge could bring himself to write thus.\r\nDigitalis has a certain effect on the heart-beat; nitrite of amyl\r\ndiminishes arterial tension. The Registrar-General's returns for all\r\ndiseases of the circulation include every sort and kind of organic\r\ndisease of the valves of the heart; include also pericarditis,\r\naneurism, senile gangrene, embolism, phlebitis, varicose veins, and\r\n35,499 deaths from \"other and undefined diseases of heart or\r\ncirculatory system.\"\r\n\r\nRABIES\r\n\r\nFor rabies, Mr. Berdoe praises the \"Buisson Bath Treatment for the\r\nPrevention and Cure of Hydrophobia.\" The virtues of this treatment are\r\nproclaimed by the Chairman of the Canine Defence League, F. E.\r\nPirkis, Esq., R.N., of Nutfield, Surrey, and it is founded, we are\r\ntold, _on the simple common-sense principle that if poison is injected\r\ninto a person's veins the best thing to do is to get it out as quickly\r\nas possible_. This sentence, and the reference to Mr. Pirkis for\r\nfurther particulars, and the fact that there is, or was, a Buisson\r\nBath at the \"National Anti-vivisection Hospital,\" bring us to the\r\nquestion, What is the value of the evidence in favour of this\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nMr. Berdoe, in his Catechism of Vivisection (1903), gives this\r\nevidence at considerable length. _The treatment_, he says, _is\r\nsimplicity itself. It is merely the use of the vapour bath, which\r\ncauses a free action of the skin to be set up, this draws the blood to\r\nthe surface of the body, and so relieves the congestion of the\r\ninternal organs._ Let us consider this sentence. (1.) Suppose that\r\nX---- were bitten by a mad dog, say on March 1st, and on March 8th he\r\ntook a course of Buisson Baths, for safety's sake. There would be no\r\ncongestion, at that period, of his internal organs; what would be the\r\ngood of drawing the blood to the surface of his body? Mr. Pirkis says\r\nthat there would be poison in his veins; it would be a very subtle\r\npoison. How can Mr. Pirkis tell that it is all in his veins and none\r\nof it elsewhere? Again, X---- would be feeling perfectly well. How\r\nwould a vapour-bath get this poison out of his veins? It could not do\r\nit by relieving the congestion of his internal organs, for they would\r\nnot be congested. How would it do it? And how would Mr. Pirkis know\r\nwhen it had done it? (2.) Suppose that X---- were bitten by a mad dog,\r\nand, in due time, were seized by hydrophobia. Has Mr. Pirkis ever seen\r\na case of that disease--ever seen a case of hydrophobia? Are they\r\ngoing to tie X---- down, or steam him under chloroform, or what? And\r\nhow many baths would he want? But there are cases; there is evidence;\r\na \"mass of cures in Asia.\" Let us look at them; and let us divide them\r\ninto cases of prevention and cases of cure. Let us take, first, the\r\ncases of cure.\r\n\r\nThere are five of these. Five, and no more. One is Dr. Buisson; cured\r\nby one bath, while he was trying to commit suicide; nothing said about\r\nthe dog. One is a case at Kischineff, near Odessa, 18 years ago; no\r\nevidence is given that the dog was rabid. One is a case at Arlington,\r\nNew Jersey, 18 years ago; no evidence is given that the dog was rabid.\r\nOne is the case of Pauline Kiehl; no date; no reference to say where\r\nthe case is published; no account of her symptoms. And one is a case\r\nat the Jaffna Hospital, Ceylon; no date; and nothing said about the\r\ndog. Of these five cases, three were a boy, a lad, and a little girl;\r\nbut their ages are not given. Five cases in 20 years; they hail from\r\nall parts of the world, France, Russia, the United States, Ceylon, and\r\nFrance again; three of them happened 18 years ago, or more. And, we\r\nmay be certain, not one of them is genuine. Spurious hydrophobia, the\r\nsimulation of the disease out of sheer terror of it, as in Dr.\r\nBuisson's case, is well known.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the cases of prevention. Over 80 of them, we are told;\r\nbut seven are especially noted. Four in 1895, under the care of Dr.\r\nGanguli of Dinajpur; two in 1896, under the care of Dr. Dass of\r\nNarainganj; and one in 1896, Mr. Kotwal of Bassein. Of this \"mass of\r\ncures in Asia,\" we all know what would have been said if Pasteur had\r\nbeen in charge of them; that the dogs were not rabid, that the bites\r\nwere not infected, that the wonder is that the poor deluded victims\r\nwere not added to Pasteur's hecatomb.\r\n\r\nNext, what does Mr. Berdoe say of the division of all patients at the\r\nPasteur Institute into classes A, B, and C? Does he admit that a dog\r\nis proved to have been rabid, if a minute portion of its nervous\r\ntissue, taken from it after death, and put into a rabbit, causes the\r\nrabbit to have paralytic rabies? No; there are still two things left\r\nfor him to say:--\r\n\r\n1. He says, on the authority of the _Veterinary Record_ of ten years\r\nago, that _the death of a rabbit with cerebral symptoms is not a\r\npositive indication of death from rabies_.\r\n\r\n2. He says that Vulpian discovered that healthy human saliva was\r\npoisonous to rabbits, and that it contained a micro-organism which\r\nPasteur had also found in the saliva of a rabid patient. What does\r\nthis statement prove or disprove? It is twenty-five years old; but Mr.\r\nSomerville Wood, not long ago, used it at a debating society with\r\ngreat fervour.\r\n\r\nAlso Mr. Berdoe quotes the late M. Peter, Dr. Lutaud's forerunner;\r\nquotes an _obiter dictum_ of Professor Billroth, but without any date;\r\ntells us that Pasteur himself, in a letter, referring to one\r\nparticular case, declared cauterisation to be a sufficient preventive,\r\nbut does not tell us the date of the letter, or the facts of the case;\r\nand quotes a death-rate, but stops at 1890. Of course, any method of\r\ntreatment, if you ransack its records over a sufficient number of\r\nyears, will show, now and again, failures or disasters. Take, for\r\ninstance, those methods of light-treatment, which Mr. Berdoe praises\r\nso highly. They have had many failures, and one or two disasters. If\r\nthey had been discovered by the help of experiments on animals, we\r\nmight have had a pamphlet from the National Society, _The Roentgen\r\n\"Cure\": its list of Victims_.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATE A AND CERTIFICATE B\r\n\r\nFrequent use has been made of some words spoken by the Home Secretary\r\nin Parliament, on July 24th, 1899. He was asked whether he would state\r\nwhat rules were laid down with regard to the granting or signing of\r\ncertificates dispensing with the use of anæsthetics in experiments on\r\nanimals; and whether there was any limit to the number of such\r\ncertificates which one person might sign, or to the number of\r\nexperiments upon different animals which might be performed by the\r\nperson holding one such certificate. There can be no doubt as to the\r\nmeaning of these questions. Certificate A, which is granted only for\r\ninoculation experiments or similar proceedings, and never for any\r\nserious cutting operation, dispenses wholly with anæsthetics.\r\nCertificate B, which is granted for any kind of operation _plus_\r\nobservation of the animal after operation, dispenses partly with\r\nanæsthetics; that is to say, the operation is done under an\r\nanæsthetic, and the subsequent observation of the animal, which is\r\ncounted as part of the experiment, is made without an anæsthetic. The\r\nquestions come to this: When the Home Office grants Certificate A, or\r\nCertificate B, what precautions does it take against any abuse of\r\nthese certificates, and what restrictions does it impose on them?\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary answered:\r\n\r\n   \"It is the practice of the Home Office, in addition to the fact\r\n   that all certificates expire on December 31st of the year in\r\n   which they are granted, to limit the number, and this is always\r\n   done in the case of serious experiments in which the use of\r\n   anæsthetics is wholly or partly dispensed with.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ says that the Home Secretary said \"serious experiments.\"\r\nMr. Coleridge says that _Hansard_ says that the Home Secretary said\r\n\"serious operations.\" We need not doubt that Mr. Coleridge is right;\r\nbut we may doubt whether Hansard underlines the word _wholly_, as Mr.\r\nColeridge does. Anyhow, it does not matter now whether the Home\r\nSecretary, seven years ago, said _experiments_ or _operations_. His\r\nmeaning is clear enough; that, in all serious procedures, whether they\r\nbe under Certificate A or under Certificate B, a limit is put to the\r\nnumber of experiments. Which is the plain truth, as everybody knows\r\nwho is concerned in the administration of the Act; and the limit may\r\nbe very strict indeed. After this statement by the Home Secretary in\r\n1899, we still find Dr. Abiathar Wall, the Hon. Treasurer of the\r\nLondon Anti-vivisection Society, saying in 1900 that a _vivisector has\r\nonly to say that he has a theory whereby he hopes to discover a cure\r\nfor, say, neuralgia of the little finger, and the Home Secretary\r\npromptly arms him with a license to torture as diabolically as he\r\npleases and as many animals as he deems fit_. And the National Society\r\nhas made constant use of this phrase about \"serious experiments\";\r\ndeclaring that the Home Secretary himself has said that animals are\r\ntortured under the Act. Here are three statements to that effect, made\r\nby the National Society's Parliamentary Secretary, by its Lecturer,\r\nand by its Hon. Secretary:--\r\n\r\n   1. (Annual Meeting, Queen's Hall, May 1900.)--\"If you are still\r\n   unconvinced--if any one is not thoroughly satisfied that there\r\n   is ample cause for the anti-vivisectionist movement to-day--it\r\n   is only necessary for me to refer you to the words of the Home\r\n   Secretary, as spoken in Parliament, in the year 1898.[49] He\r\n   said: 'There are serious operations which are performed, during\r\n   which the use of anæsthetics is wholly or partially dispensed\r\n   with.' Could there be any more sweeping indictment than that? Is\r\n   there any need for me to attempt to convince you that the lower\r\n   animals are vivisected painfully, after the words officially\r\n   spoken by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons?\"\r\n\r\n   2. \"If you want any further proof I will quote from Hansard,\r\n   July 24th, 1899, when the then Home Secretary stated in the\r\n   House of Commons that serious experiments take place under the\r\n   law of England, in which the use of anæsthetics is wholly or\r\n   partially dispensed with. Now, I affirm that serious experiments\r\n   in which anæsthetics are wholly or partially dispensed with mean\r\n   torture pure and simple.\"\r\n\r\n   3. (Annual Meeting, St. James's Hall, May 1901.)--\"If this were\r\n   not enough, the late Home Secretary has told us the facts. I\r\n   have Hansard here. On July 24th, 1899, the late Home Secretary\r\n   in his place in Parliament, and in his official capacity as Home\r\n   Secretary, told us that 'serious experiments, in which the use\r\n   of anæsthetics have been wholly or partially dispensed with,' do\r\n   take place in English laboratories. We know, therefore, that\r\n   torture does take place.\"\r\n\r\n  [49] This should be 1899.\r\n\r\nEach of the three speakers uses this phrase as a final and\r\nirresistible argument. _If you are still unconvinced. If you want any\r\nfurther proof. If this were not enough_--they all of them play the\r\nHome Secretary, as a sure card: at Queen's Hall, at St. James's Hall,\r\nthey produce him as though it were indeed unanswerable. Since they are\r\nwilling to go back to July, let us take them back to May. This phrase\r\nabout \"serious experiments\" was spoken on July 24th, 1899. On May 9th\r\nof that year, a question was put and answered in the House. It was put\r\nby the same gentleman who put the question in July; it was answered by\r\nthe same Home Secretary; and it was practically the same question.\r\nThe Home Secretary, in his answer to it, said:--\r\n\r\n   \"The sole use of this Certificate (B) is to authorise the\r\n   keeping alive of the animal, after the influence of the\r\n   anæsthetic has passed off, for the purpose of observation and\r\n   study. I should certainly not allow any certificate involving\r\n   dissections or painful operations without the fresh use of\r\n   anæsthetics.\"\r\n\r\nHere, in May 1899, we have this emphatic statement, that Certificate B\r\nis _not_ allowed for \"serious operations without anæsthetics.\" Why did\r\nthe National Society stop at July? If it had only gone a few weeks\r\nfurther back, a surprise was in store for it. But at July it stuck;\r\nthus it was still able to say all sorts of things about \"legalised\r\ntorture.\" So late as May 6th, 1902, at the great annual meeting at St.\r\nJames's Hall, the Rev. Reginald Talbot said:--\r\n\r\n   \"Certificate B makes it necessary that the operator should\r\n   produce complete anæsthesia during the initial operation, but\r\n   (please mark this) after the initial operation is over, after\r\n   the animal has returned to the state of semi or complete\r\n   consciousness, there is then allowed by this certificate a\r\n   period of observation upon a semi-sensible or completely\r\n   sensible animal. The animal is opened, is disembowelled, and in\r\n   that condition his vital organs can be probed and stimulated.\r\n   Now that is something more than pain; it deserves something more\r\n   than the name of even severe and prolonged pain. Surely this\r\n   comes within the tract and region of what we may call agony.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Certificate A, the inoculations-certificate, which is used for\r\ninoculations only, and therefore is granted for nine experiments out\r\nof every ten, he said:--\r\n\r\n   \"There is a Certificate A, which, if it were granted, and when\r\n   it is granted--and pray you mark my words, for I know what I am\r\n   speaking about, and I want you to know too--would allow major\r\n   operations to be performed upon animals, cats, dogs, or any\r\n   other animals, without the use of any anæsthetic at all. I know\r\n   quite well that that certificate has not been applied for, or\r\n   has not been granted this last year, or, so far as I know, in\r\n   any previous year, but I say this,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand these words. Certificate A is never\r\ngranted for major operations. It is never granted (save in conjunction\r\nwith another certificate) for any sort or kind of experiment on a cat\r\nor a dog, or a horse, or an ass, or a mule. It is more in use than all\r\nthe other certificates put together; it covers nine experiments out of\r\nevery ten. We shall try in vain to guess how this mistake arose in the\r\nspeaker's mind. But, at the great annual meeting of the chief of all\r\nthe anti-vivisection societies, it is strange indeed that nobody seems\r\nto have corrected him. This description of a certificate which does\r\nnot exist--_I know what I am speaking about_, he says, _and I want you\r\nto know too_--was applauded by an audience that filled the whole hall.\r\nNobody on the platform put him right. And, in the next number of its\r\nofficial journal, the National Society reported every word of his\r\nspeech, and said that he had _analysed the Act and its administration\r\nin a striking and powerful manner_.\r\n\r\nCURARE\r\n\r\n\"Curare,\" says Mr. Berdoe, \"paralyses the peripheral ends of motor\r\nnerves, even when given in very minute doses.\" That is to say, it\r\nprevents all voluntary motion. Then comes this frank admission, \"Large\r\ndoses paralyse the vagus nerve and the ends of sensory nerves.\" That\r\nis to say, it can be pushed, under artificial respiration, till it\r\nparalyses sensation. With small doses, the ends of the motor nerves\r\nlose touch with the voluntary muscles. With large doses, under\r\nartificial respiration, the ends of the sensory nerves lose touch with\r\nthe brain. Let us agree with Mr. Berdoe that curare does act in this\r\nway; that it does not heighten sensation, and has no effect, save in\r\nvery large doses, on sensation, and then abolishes sensation. Only, of\r\ncourse, to procure this anæsthetic effect, the animal may have to be\r\nsubjected to artificial respiration.\r\n\r\n(The evidence as to the action of curare on the sensory nerves rests\r\nnot on the case of accidental poisoning recorded by Mr. White, though\r\nthat case does point that way, but on Schiff's experiments on the\r\nlocal exclusion of the poison from one leg of the frog by ligature of\r\nan artery.)\r\n\r\nThis, surely, is a true definition of curare, that it is a painless\r\npoison, which in small doses prevents the transmission of motor\r\nimpulses; and, in large doses, which may necessitate the use of\r\nartificial respiration, prevents the transmission of sensory impulses.\r\nMr. Berdoe can hardly refuse to accept this definition; indeed, it is\r\nhis own. And, certainly, he would be a bold man who said that a small\r\ndose of curare has any effect on sensation; or that the exact strength\r\nof any one specimen of curare is standardised as a supply of antitoxin\r\nis standardised.\r\n\r\nNow we have a perfect right to take a practical view of curare. At the\r\npresent time, and in our own country, how is it used? The Act forbids\r\nits use as an anæsthetic. What evidence does Mr. Berdoe bring that it\r\nis so used?\r\n\r\n1. He quotes Professor Rutherford's experiments. These were made at\r\nleast 16 or 17 years ago.\r\n\r\n2. He quotes Dr. Porter's paper, \"On the Results of Ligation of the\r\nCoronary Arteries.\" (_Journal of Physiology_, vol. xv. 1894, p. 121.)\r\nDr. Porter speaks of four experiments made under morphia _plus_\r\ncurare. These experiments were made at Berlin, 14 years ago, by the\r\nProfessor of Physiology at Harvard, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n3. He refers to Professor Stewart's papers, in the same volume of the\r\n_Journal of Physiology_. The one experiment which he quotes at some\r\nlength was made at Strasburg, 14 years ago or more.\r\n\r\nBut we want to know what is done now and here under the Act, not what\r\nwas done at Berlin or Strasburg 14 or more years ago. Still, the\r\nexperiments by Professor Stewart have been in constant use, among the\r\nopponents of all experiments on animals. In May 1900, at the great\r\nannual meeting of the National Society, at Queen's Hall, Dr. Reinhardt\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n   \"I will pass on to prove to you, by a few conclusive evidences,\r\n   for which I can give you chapter and verse, that torture is\r\n   inflicted on animals by British vivisectors to-day. Now, if you\r\n   buy the 15th volume of the _Journal of Physiology_, and look at\r\n   page 86, you will find there,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTo prove that animals are tortured in England to-day, he quotes one\r\nexperiment made at Strasburg ever so long ago. And, in 1901, Mr.\r\nColeridge wrote, in the _Morning Leader_, saying: _It is with curare,\r\nwhich paralyses motion and leaves sensation intact, that all the most\r\nshocking vivisections are performed._ And, the same year, Mr. Stephen\r\nSmith, a \"Medical Patron\" of the London Society, wrote: _I state\r\nemphatically that when curare is used, proper anæsthesia is out of the\r\nquestion...._ _Curare is used daily throughout England. Mention of an\r\nanæsthetic in a report is no guarantee that the animal was\r\nanæsthetised._\r\n\r\nI cannot find, in all the anti-vivisection literature which I have\r\nread, any shadow of evidence that any experiment of any sort or kind\r\nhas been made in this country, on any sort or kind of animal, under\r\ncurare alone, for the last sixteen or seventeen years. I believe that\r\nI might go further back than that. But surely that is far enough.\r\n\r\nCertainly, so long as any curare is used (not as an anæsthetic, but in\r\nconjunction with an anæsthetic) in any experiments on animals in this\r\ncountry, the societies will not trouble to inquire how much of it is\r\nused. I wrote, therefore, to the Professors of Physiology at\r\nEdinburgh, Cambridge, and Oxford, and asked them to tell me how much\r\ncurare was used in their laboratories throughout 1903, and what\r\nanæsthetics were given with it. Some opponents of experiments on\r\nanimals seem to think that curare is used very often. One of them says\r\nthat it is \"used daily throughout England.\" So I wrote to these\r\nProfessors at our Universities, and they kindly sent the following\r\nanswers:--\r\n\r\n   1. \"Your question _re_ curare is easily answered. We did _no_\r\n   experiments with it during the past year. Indeed, I have given\r\n   it up almost entirely for years, chiefly because it is very\r\n   difficult to get a preparation which--I suppose from\r\n   impurities--does not seriously affect the heart. There might\r\n   still be occasions during which it is necessary to use it--if,\r\n   _e.g._ the _least_ muscular movement would vitiate the results\r\n   of an experiment. But I find it possible in nearly all cases to\r\n   get such absolute quiescence with morphia or chloral (besides\r\n   ether and chloroform) that to all intents and purposes I have\r\n   long given up the use of curare. Of course, if I had occasion\r\n   to use it, an anæsthetic would be administered at the same\r\n   time.\"\r\n\r\n   2. \"I have asked those who worked in the physiological\r\n   laboratories in 1903 to give me a return of the number of\r\n   experiments done and of the number in which curare was used.\r\n   Including my own experiments, I find that 160 in all were made\r\n   under the License and Certificates B, EE, C. Curare was given in\r\n   four cases; in two of these the A.C.E. mixture was the\r\n   anæsthetic, in the other two ether.\"\r\n\r\n   3. At the third laboratory, during 1903, curare was given to\r\n   seven frogs deprived of their brains before it was given, and to\r\n   one rabbit under ether.\r\n\r\nThat was the whole use of curare, during a whole year, in three great\r\nUniversities: at one, seven inanimate frogs, and one rabbit under\r\nether; at another, four animals, under A.C.E. or ether; at another,\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nINCOMPLETE ANÆSTHESIA\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, at an operation, that the patient moves. Mostly,\r\nthis movement is at the moment of the first incision through the skin;\r\nbut it may be at some later period during the operation. He does not\r\nremember, after the operation, that he moved, or that he felt\r\nanything. That is incomplete anæsthesia, or light anæsthesia. The\r\ncorneal reflex may be abolished, and still the patient may move.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago some experiments were made in this country by an\r\nAmerican surgeon. In the published account of them, it was said that\r\none of the animals was, at one time, under incomplete anæsthesia, and\r\nthat, in the case of another animal, the anæsthesia was at one time\r\noverlooked. This latter phrase meant not that the anæsthetic had been\r\nleft off, but that it had been given in excess, so that the\r\nblood-pressure suddenly fell. The character of the experiments, and\r\nthe occurrence of these two phrases about the anæsthesia, roused some\r\ncriticism, and the Home Office instituted an inquiry into the matter.\r\n\"That inquiry,\" it said, October 11th, 1899, \"resulted in showing no\r\nevidence whatever that the animals experimented on by Dr. Crile felt\r\npain. On the contrary, all the evidence shows they did not.\" The Act\r\ndoes not go into questions of corneal reflex, and unconscious muscular\r\nmovements, and all the undefinable shades between incomplete\r\nanæsthesia and complete anæsthesia and profound anæsthesia. \"The only\r\nsubstantial question,\" says the Home Office, \"is whether or no the\r\nanimal has been during the operation under the influence of an\r\nanæsthetic of sufficient power to prevent it feeling pain. This is the\r\nrequirement of the law.\" We cannot refuse to call morphia and chloral\r\nanæsthetics, for there are deaths every year from an over-dose of\r\nthem. And we cannot admit that an animal under an anæsthetic, because\r\nit makes a movement, is in pain or is conscious; for we know that a\r\npatient under operation may move yet feel nothing. Every hospital\r\nsurgeon, and every anæsthetist, who has seen a whole legion of\r\npatients go under chloroform or ether and come out of it, and\r\neverybody who has been under these anæsthetics, they all know that\r\nincomplete anæsthesia is not \"sham anæsthesia,\" and that movements,\r\neven purposive movements, may occur without consciousness, without\r\npain, alike in men and in animals.\r\n\r\nONE ANIMAL AND ONE EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the Home Office allows a licensee to make a certain number of\r\nexperiments, it means that he may experiment on that number of animals\r\nand no more. The Home Office, having heard what the experiments are to\r\nbe, where they are to be made, on what kind of animals, and for what\r\npurpose, and having taken advice about them, allows him to make a\r\nfixed number, and adds any restrictions that it likes, _e.g._ that he\r\nmust send in a preliminary report when he has made half that number.\r\nAnd one thing is certain, that one experiment = one animal, and that\r\n10 experiments = 10 animals, and no more. Everybody knows that, who\r\nknows anything at all about the administration of the Act.\r\n\r\nNow take a false statement, which has been made again and again during\r\nmany years, that one experiment = any number of animals, and observe\r\nhow it spread.\r\n\r\n1. In the House of Commons, on March 12th, 1897, Mr. MacNeill asked\r\nwhether any record were kept of the number of animals used in\r\nexperiments during 1895, and said that 200 or 300 animals are\r\nsometimes used in a single experiment, and that 80 or 90 is a common\r\nnumber. The Home Secretary answered: \"The honourable member is under\r\nan entire misapprehension. The number of animals used does not exceed\r\nthe number of experiments given in the return.\"\r\n\r\n2. A year later, May 18th, 1898, at the Annual Meeting of the National\r\nSociety, Mr. MacNeill said again: \"Any one casually reading that\r\nreport (the Inspector's report to Government) would imagine that each\r\nexperiment was on the body of a single animal. It is nothing of the\r\nkind. An experiment is a series of investigations in some particular\r\nbranch, and sometimes 20, 30, or 40 animals are sacrificed in the one\r\nexperiment.\" The National Society published this speech in its\r\nofficial journal.\r\n\r\n3. A few weeks later, an anonymous letter in the _Bradford Observer_\r\nsaid, \"Any one casually reading the report would imagine that each\r\nexperiment was on the body of a single animal. It is nothing of the\r\nkind. An experiment is a series of investigations in some particular\r\nbranch, and sometimes 20, 30, or 40 animals are sacrificed in the one\r\nexperiment.\"\r\n\r\n4. On August 1st, 1898, the National Society published this letter in\r\nits official journal, under the heading, \"Our Cause in the Press.\"\r\n\r\n5. On October 21st, 1902, a letter in a provincial paper said that\r\n\"one experiment\" means \"not one animal, but a series of operations on\r\nmany animals.\"\r\n\r\n6. In January 1903, the National Society admitted that its action in\r\n1898 (see 4) was \"unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n7. On June 25, 1903, in Parliament, Mr. MacNeill again said that \"an\r\nexperiment\" did not mean one operation, but a series of researches,\r\n\"often performed by persons who had no more skill than the children\r\nwho broke up a watch.\"\r\n\r\n8. About this time, the same false statement was made by an\r\nAnti-vivisection Society at Manchester.\r\n\r\n9. A little later, it was made by the National Canine Defence League,\r\nin these words, \"Each experiment may include any number of dogs. There\r\nis no limit fixed by law.\" On January 11th, 1904, in the _Times_, the\r\nleaflet containing this and other \"grossly false and misleading\r\nstatements\" was vehemently denounced by the National Society.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find a better instance of the spreading of a\r\nfalse report. An experiment? Oh, it is any number of animals--20 of\r\nthem, 30 of them; 200, 300 of them; hecatombs, and triple hecatombs;\r\nany young doctor can get leave to cut them up.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATES E AND EE\r\n\r\nFor all inoculations and similar proceedings, Certificate A is\r\nnecessary. For all experiments where the animal is allowed to recover\r\nfrom the anæsthetic, Certificate B is necessary. But these\r\ncertificates do not extend to the dog, the cat, the horse, the mule,\r\nor the ass. The three latter animals are also scheduled under\r\nCertificate F; the dog and the cat under Certificates E and EE. That\r\nis to say, to inoculate a dog, _e.g._ for the study of the preventive\r\ntreatment against distemper, it is necessary to hold a License, _plus_\r\nCertificate A, _plus_ Certificate E; to operate on a dog, and let him\r\nrecover, it is necessary to hold a License, _plus_ Certificate B,\r\n_plus_ Certificate EE.\r\n\r\nAnd it is certain that the Home Office does enforce and emphasise here\r\nthe spirit of the Act; and that it does guard and restrict and tie up\r\nCertificate EE with its own hands.\r\n\r\nNow let us take an instance, which shows in a very unfavourable light\r\nthe methods of the National Canine Defence League. Three years ago,\r\ncertain experiments were made on dogs, for the purpose of finding the\r\nbest way of resuscitating persons apparently drowned. The Home\r\nSecretary was asked whether he knew that certain of these experiments\r\nwere to be made without anæsthetics; and he answered, \"In view of the\r\ngreat importance of the subject in connection with the saving of\r\nhuman life, and of the strong recommendations received in support of\r\nthe experiments, I have not felt justified in disallowing the\r\ncertificates.\"\r\n\r\nA great outcry was raised against these experiments by the National\r\nAnti-vivisection Society and the Canine Defence League. The National\r\nSociety, in its official journal, August 1903, said that it was now\r\nproved, \"that in England to-day experiments are performed without\r\nanæsthetics which involve inconceivable agony to dogs, and this with\r\nthe deliberate permission of the Home Secretary.\" Mr. Coleridge made a\r\npublic appeal to all humane societies, to go down with all their\r\nstrength into Kent, on that not far distant day when the Home\r\nSecretary would have to face his constituents, and turn him out of\r\nParliament. The Canine Defence League sent two memorials to the Home\r\nOffice, circulated a petition, and issued leaflets, entitled _A\r\nNational Scandal_, _Scientific Torture_, _A Peep behind the Scenes_,\r\nand so forth. We must consider one of these leaflets at some length;\r\nbut first let us see what is the truth about these experiments. They\r\nwere made by the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh; and he has\r\nkindly written to me about them. _In every experiment, except two, the\r\nanimal was, throughout the whole experiment, under complete anæsthesia\r\nwith chloroform or ether. In two cases, and in two only, a small\r\npreliminary operation, under anæsthesia, having been performed, the\r\nanimal was allowed to recover from the anæsthetic, or almost to\r\nrecover from it, and was then and there submerged and drowned, at once\r\nand completely, to death; no attempt at resuscitation was made; it\r\nbecame unconscious in a little more than a minute._\r\n\r\nIn the face of these facts, what is to be said of the outcry raised\r\nby the Canine Defence League? They presented two memorials to the Home\r\nSecretary: they got up a monster petition with thousands of\r\nsignatures; and they issued the following leaflet:---\r\n\r\n   SIGN THE NATION'S PETITION TO PARLIAMENT AGAINST THE\r\n   DISSECTION OF LIVE DOGS _In Medical Laboratories_ */\r\n\r\n   1. Dogs, on account of their docility and obedience to the word\r\n   of command, are the animals chiefly selected for torture.\r\n\r\n   2. Thousands of dogs are tortured yearly by licensed\r\n   experimenters.\r\n\r\n   3. The total number of experiments performed in 1902 was 14,906,\r\n   12,776 of which were without anæsthetics.\r\n\r\n   4. The Home Secretary stated in Parliament on July 22nd, 1903,\r\n   that neither the starving of animals to death nor the forced\r\n   over-feeding of animals were included in these returns.\r\n\r\n   5. Nor does the number 14,906 give the number of dogs used, for\r\n   each experiment may include any number of dogs--there is no\r\n   limit fixed by law.\r\n\r\n   6. The Home Secretary stated in Parliament on May 11th, 1903,\r\n   that at one laboratory alone in London 232 dogs were used for\r\n   vivisectional experiments last year.\r\n\r\n   7. There are now laboratories scattered over the whole of the\r\n   United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n   8. The Home Secretary stated in Parliament on 10th July 1903,\r\n   that one dog may be used _again_ and _again_ for vivisectional\r\n   experiment or demonstration--and this without anæsthetics.\r\n\r\n   Think of the condition of the poor dog between each\r\n   living-dissection.\r\n\r\n   Has not the time come for the nation to rise as one man and\r\n   say--\r\n\r\n    \"This shall not be\"?\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that even the National Anti-vivisection Society, in a\r\nletter to the _Times_, December 11th, 1903, denounced this leaflet.\r\nThe wonder is, that Mr. Pirkis, R.N., the chairman of the Canine\r\nLeague, tried to defend it. _This deplorable leaflet_, said the\r\nNational Society: _It contains a series of grossly false and\r\nmisleading statements._ Let us take it paragraph by paragraph. The\r\nfirst two paragraphs are grossly false. The third suppresses the\r\ntruth. The fourth is grossly false; the Home Secretary said that\r\nneither the starving of animals to death nor the forced over-feeding\r\nof animals was included among the experiments _authorised or\r\nperformed_. Paragraph five is grossly false. So is paragraph six: not\r\none word was said about any experiments, either by the Home Secretary\r\nor by anybody else. The entire number of all dogs and cats together,\r\nunder Certificates A, B, E, and EE, throughout the whole kingdom, that\r\nyear, was 344. Paragraph eight is grossly false.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor want of space, it is impossible to consider all the special\r\narguments of the anti-vivisection societies. Of course, among these\r\nspecial arguments, there are a few which have something in them. How\r\ncould they all of them be utterly false? They go back over thirty\r\nyears; they are drawn from all parts of the world. This incessant\r\nrummaging of medical books and journals, British and foreign; and all\r\nthis everlasting espionage; the whole elaborate system of a sort of\r\nsecret service--these methods, year in year out, are bound to find,\r\nnow and again, a fault somewhere. But I do say, having read and\r\nre-read a vast quantity of the publications of these societies, that\r\nthey are, taken as a whole, a standing disgrace to the cause; that\r\nthey are tainted through and through with brutal language, imbecile\r\njokes, and innumerable falsehoods; that they have neither the honesty,\r\nnor the common decency, which should justify them. Still, here it is\r\nthat the money goes. There is _money in the business_; there is _milk\r\nin the cocoa-nut_; and _twopence more, and up goes the donkey_. These\r\nare the phrases used, by the National Anti-vivisection Society, of the\r\nbacteriologists, and the men who are working at cancer. But these\r\nsocieties, that spend thousands every year, what have they got to show\r\nfor it all? They have, with much else of the same kind, the\r\n_Zoophilist_. Truly, a fine result; a high-class official journal, the\r\n_recognised organ of the anti-vivisection movement in England_.\r\n\r\nTake, for a final instance, one or two of the things said about\r\nanæsthetics. On June 12th, 1897, in the _Echo_, Mr. Berdoe said that\r\ncertain experiments, involving severe operations, had been made on\r\ndogs under morphia and curare. He based this assertion on the account\r\nof the experiments in the _Journal of Physiology_. On June 18th, Mr.\r\nWeir, in the House of Commons, called attention to this assertion; and\r\nthe Home Secretary promised to inquire into the matter. On July 18th,\r\nMr. Weir asked whether this inquiry had been made; and the Home\r\nSecretary answered:--\r\n\r\n   \"Yes, I have made full inquiry into the allegations contained in\r\n   the letter and statement which the honourable member forwarded\r\n   to me, and find that they are absolutely baseless. The\r\n   experiments referred to were performed on animals under full\r\n   chloroform anæsthesia; the morphia, to which alone allusion was\r\n   made in the published account of the experiments, being used in\r\n   addition. Curare was used, but not as an anæsthetic.\"\r\n\r\nIt is simple enough. The gentlemen who made the experiments did not\r\nknow that the National Society buys and ransacks the _Journal of\r\nPhysiology_; or did not care. But the National Society called this\r\nanswer a \"Fruitless Official Denial\"; and Mr. Coleridge sent an\r\n\"explanatory letter\" to the London daily papers, accusing all the\r\nexperimenters of \"amending their published record so as to make it fit\r\nin with the Government report.\" In 1899, the National Society\r\npublished that sentence, which has already been quoted, about the\r\n_Nine Circles_, and the \"whiff of chloroform possibly administered.\"\r\nIn 1900, it said, \"The chloroformists of the physiological\r\nlaboratories are doubtless common porters, with no technical knowledge\r\nof their work.\" In 1901, it said, \"Our readers will remember that Mr.\r\nColeridge has had more than one battle with the Home Office on the\r\nquestion of complete and incomplete anæsthesia. We need hardly say\r\nthat the victory on each occasion rested with our Honorary Secretary.\"\r\nAnd again, \"By many turns of the anti-vivisection screw we have at\r\nlast extracted (from the Home Office) the admission that pain is not\r\nunknown in the laboratories.\" In 1902, it said, \"The blessed word\r\nanæsthesia warns off the profane anti-vivisectionist who would rob the\r\naltars of science of their victims.\" Take later instances. In 1903, we\r\nfind Mr. Wood saying that _we may be sure the narcosis becomes\r\nprofound when the inspectors knock at the door of the laboratory_;\r\nDr. Brand, saying that _in all experiments, other than inoculations,\r\nit is probable that only a whiff of chloroform is given, to satisfy\r\nthe experimenter's conscience, and to enable him to make humane\r\nstatements to the public_; and Mr. Berdoe, saying that _vivisectors,\r\nwhere they use anything except curare, employ sham anæsthetics_.\r\n\r\nBeside such statements as these, there is the argument from the very\r\nrare action of morphia as a stimulant (see _British Medical Journal_,\r\nJanuary 14th, 1899); but this argument is not in question. The real\r\nargument is, that a man who makes experiments on animals is likely\r\nenough to tell lies about them. As Mr. Berdoe says, of a very explicit\r\nstatement about anæsthetics, made by the late Professor Roy, _It is\r\nand must be absolutely untrue_. Read again that sentence about the\r\n\"whiff of chloroform.\" The phrase is thirty years old; but, like Sir\r\nWilliam Fergusson's evidence in 1875, it is still in use. Or take that\r\none phrase--_where they use anything but curare_. It affords, in six\r\nwords, a perfect instance of the anti-vivisectionist at his worst.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. \"OUR CAUSE IN PARLIAMENT\"\r\n\r\nUnder this heading the official journal of the National Society\r\nreports questions asked in Parliament, and the answers given to them.\r\nThis aspect of the work of the anti-vivisection societies, and the\r\npart taken by them in elections, and their plans to amend or abolish\r\nthe Act, must be noted here.\r\n\r\nIn one year, the National Society spent £888, 13s. 2d. on \"purely\r\nelectoral work.\" That is a very large sum, when we think of _the grave\r\ninjury done to the cause of mercy by the deplorable waste of money\r\nspent in perfectly_ _unnecessary offices and salaries_. The Society's\r\njournal tells us something of this electoral work:--\r\n\r\n   1899.--\"The Parliamentary League has again been successful in\r\n   its work at bye-elections. At ---- the two candidates were\r\n   approached, and both gave more or less satisfactory answers.\r\n   Sir ----'s reply was thought to be the more satisfactory one,\r\n   and consequently our supporters gave him their votes. As our\r\n   readers are aware, he was returned.\" (In a later number, the\r\n   _Zoophilist_ hints that \"further pressure\" may be applied to\r\n   this gentleman in Parliament.)\r\n\r\n   1900.--\"The efforts of the Society will not be confined to\r\n   forwarding the interests of any one candidate or any one party.\r\n   As soon as the names of candidates were announced, Mr. Coleridge\r\n   issued to all of them a circular letter demanding their views on\r\n   the vivisection question. The numerous replies which have\r\n   already arrived, and are still arriving, afford results more\r\n   gratifying than we for a moment anticipated, and show clearly\r\n   that we are now recognised throughout Great Britain to be a\r\n   power that cannot be ignored.... Volunteer workers are also\r\n   being despatched from headquarters to various places. Readers\r\n   who have votes or who will help in any way are invited to\r\n   communicate immediately to the head office, when information\r\n   about the views of their candidates will be at once sent to\r\n   them.\"\r\n\r\nThe London Society also, like the National Society, desires to have a\r\nrepresentative in Parliament; and this desire is stated in emphatic\r\nwords in one of its reports. The general tone of that report has\r\nalready been noted. It loves big black headlines, NO SURRENDER, THE\r\nAWAKENING CHURCHES, A TRUCULENT SCIENCE, THE SINEWS OF WAR, THE APPEAL\r\nTO THE PEOPLE. They had better ensure the return of that opponent of\r\nvaccination who says that you can bring any member of Parliament to\r\nyour knees.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, these societies follow the successful candidates on\r\ntheir subsequent careers. \"In Parliament,\" says the London Society,\r\n\"the Society's work is carried on as occasion permits. Members of\r\nParliament are written to or are personally seen at the House of\r\nCommons. Questions are drafted for them to submit to the Home\r\nSecretary, and one or more officers of the Society are in constant\r\nattendance at the House of Commons when the question of vivisection is\r\nlikely to be raised.\" And the National Society says, \"In order to\r\nstimulate attention (to Mr. Coleridge's Bill) our lecturer has been\r\nassiduous in his attendance in the lobby of the House during the\r\npresent session, and by personal interviews has been able to arouse a\r\ngood deal of interest in it on both sides of the House.\" It is evident\r\nthat \"Our Cause in Parliament\" is urged with diligence, and is not\r\nleft to stand or fall according to the unsolicited conscience of what\r\nthe London Society calls the _average lay member_. Take, for example,\r\nthe system of drafting questions to be put to the Home Secretary. It\r\nmay or may not take off the edge of sincerity; anyhow, the question\r\nshould be drafted with great care. On February 26th, 1900, a question\r\nwas asked as to certain observations which were alleged to have been\r\nmade on living animals, but in fact had been made on their organs\r\nremoved after death. The National Society said of this mistake:--\r\n\r\n   \"We wish our readers to know that the question was not prompted\r\n   by any communication from our Society, and we think it\r\n   unfortunate that members of Parliament should be asked to put\r\n   questions in the House by persons who do not realise that\r\n   questions based on inaccurate premises can do nothing but harm\r\n   to our cause. It is hard that the whole anti-vivisection\r\n   movement should suffer through the carelessness and indolence of\r\n   those who will neither be at the pains to avoid inaccuracy by\r\n   their own study and investigation, nor by consulting the\r\n   National Society's officers.\"\r\n\r\nThese careless, indolent, inaccurate persons, who think so lightly of\r\nthe National Society's officers, and draft a question so silly that\r\nthe whole cause is damaged, bring us back to the point whence we\r\nstarted: the want of unity between the societies, the frequent jarring\r\nof one with another. We have still to see something of the dealings of\r\nthe National Society with Government. It is at its best, doubtless, in\r\nthe formal letters from Mr. Coleridge to the Home Office; but these,\r\nafter all, are his own work, and the Society cannot take the credit of\r\nthem. _Per contra_, we may credit to the Society, and not to Mr.\r\nColeridge, certain threats to Ministers in 1898:--\r\n\r\n   ... \"Should we be so unfortunate as to be left by you without\r\n   such an open assurance, we shall feel it our duty to employ the\r\n   strength and resources of this Society in an endeavour to\r\n   prevent your return to Parliament at the next election. We know\r\n   of a large and increasing number of your constituents who are\r\n   ready, in the unfortunate event of your being unable to reassure\r\n   them as to your attitude in the matter of endowing torture, to\r\n   place humanity above party politics.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"This Society will feel it to be its duty to use every means\r\n   in its power to prevent your return to Parliament at the next\r\n   election.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"We beg leave to inform you that at the next election the\r\n   forces of this Society will be used with the utmost vigour to\r\n   prevent your return to Parliament. We know of many, and shall no\r\n   doubt soon secure more of your constituents, pledged to place\r\n   humanity above party and vote against you on the next occasion\r\n   that you present yourself.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are we to think of these three letters? The resources of the\r\nSociety, given with some vague hope of keeping animals out of pain,\r\nare to be used for keeping Ministers out of Parliament. Note the\r\nbullying tone of the letters. It is the same thing, two years later,\r\nat the General Election, with the heckling of candidates: _We are now\r\nrecognised throughout Great Britain to be a power that cannot be\r\nignored_. A Society that bullies Ministers of State, what will it not\r\ndo to the average lay member?\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A HISTORICAL PARALLEL\r\n\r\nIt is a long way, from the plain duty to take care of animals, to the\r\narguments and general behaviour of these societies. Of course, we have\r\nseen them here from the most unfavourable point of view. From that\r\npoint of view, apart from any more favourable aspect, they have their\r\nparallel in history. The two instances are, in some ways, very unlike:\r\nbut the parallelism is worthy of note. The historical instance is more\r\nthan fifty years old: we have what was said, in 1851, against his\r\nworst opponents, by a man who had an unpopular cause to defend.\r\nNewman, in 1851, gave a set of lectures on _The Present Position of\r\nCatholics in England_: and his sayings, some of them, seem apt to our\r\npresent subject. Take the following examples. Only, here and there, a\r\nword is altered, or a phrase left out, that all offence may be\r\navoided:--\r\n\r\n   ... \"We should have cause to congratulate ourselves, though we\r\n   were able to proceed no further than to persuade our opponents\r\n   to argue out one point before going on to another. It would be\r\n   much even to get them to give up what they could not defend, and\r\n   to promise that they would not return to it. It would be much to\r\n   succeed in hindering them from making a great deal of an\r\n   objection till it is refuted, and then suddenly considering it\r\n   so small that it is not worth withdrawing. It would be much to\r\n   hinder them from eluding a defeat on one point by digressing\r\n   upon three or four others, and then presently running back to\r\n   the first, and then to and fro, to second, third, and fourth,\r\n   and treating each in turn as if quite a fresh subject on which\r\n   not a word had yet been said.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"No evidence against us is too little: no infliction too\r\n   great. Statement without proof, though inadmissible in every\r\n   other case, is all fair when we are concerned. An opponent is at\r\n   liberty to bring a charge against us, and challenge us to\r\n   refute, not any proof he brings, for he brings none, but his\r\n   simple assumption or assertion. And perhaps we accept his\r\n   challenge, and then we find we have to deal with matters so\r\n   vague or so minute, so general or so particular, that we are at\r\n   our wits' end to know how to grapple with them.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"For myself, I never should have been surprised, if, in the\r\n   course of the last nine months of persecution, some scandal in\r\n   this or that part of our cause had been brought to light and\r\n   circulated through the country to our great prejudice. No such\r\n   calamity has occurred: but oh! what would not our enemies have\r\n   paid for only one real and live sin to mock us withal. Their\r\n   fierce and unblushing effort to fix such charges where they were\r\n   impossible, shows how many eyes were fastened on us all over the\r\n   country, and how deep and fervent was the aspiration that some\r\n   among us might turn out to be a brute or a villain.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"We are dressed up like a scarecrow to gratify, on a large\r\n   scale, the passions of curiosity, fright, and hatred. Something\r\n   or other men must fear, men must loathe, men must suspect, even\r\n   if it be to turn away their minds from their own inward\r\n   miseries.... A calumny against us first appeared in 1836, it\r\n   still thrives and flourishes in 1851. I have made inquiries, and\r\n   I am told I may safely say that in the course of the fifteen\r\n   years that it has lasted, from 200,000 to 250,000 copies have\r\n   been put into circulation in America and England. A vast number\r\n   of copies has been sold at a cheap rate, and given away by\r\n   persons who ought to have known that it was a mere fiction. I\r\n   hear rumours concerning some of the distributors, which, from\r\n   the respect which I wish to entertain towards their names, I do\r\n   not know how to credit.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"The perpetual talk against us does not become truer because\r\n   it is incessant; but it continually deepens the impression, in\r\n   the minds of those who hear it, that we are impostors. There is\r\n   no increase of logical cogency; a lie is a lie just as much the\r\n   tenth time it is told as the first; or rather more, it is ten\r\n   lies instead of one; but it gains in rhetorical influence....\r\n   Thus the meetings and preachings which are ever going on against\r\n   us on all sides, though they may have no argumentative force\r\n   whatever, are still immense factories for the creation of\r\n   prejudice.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"The Prejudiced Man takes it for granted that we, who differ\r\n   from him, are universally impostors, tyrants, hypocrites,\r\n   cowards, and slaves. If he meets with any story against us, on\r\n   any or no authority, which does but fall in with this notion of\r\n   us, he eagerly catches at it. Authority goes for nothing;\r\n   likelihood, as he considers it, does instead of testimony; what\r\n   he is now told is just what he expected. Perhaps it is a random\r\n   report, put into circulation merely because it had a chance of\r\n   succeeding, or thrown like a straw to the wind; perhaps it is a\r\n   mere publisher's speculation, who thinks that a narrative of\r\n   horrors will pay well for the printing: it matters not, he is\r\n   equally convinced of its truth: he knows all about it\r\n   beforehand; it is just what he always has said; it is the old\r\n   tale over again a hundred times. Accordingly he buys it by the\r\n   thousand, and sends it about with all speed in every direction,\r\n   to his circle of friends and acquaintance, to the newspapers,\r\n   to the great speakers at public meetings.... Next comes an\r\n   absolute, explicit, total denial or refutation of the precious\r\n   calumny, whatever it may be, on unimpeachable authority. The\r\n   Prejudiced Man simply discredits this denial, and puts it aside,\r\n   not receiving any impression from it at all, or paying it the\r\n   slightest attention. This, if he can: if he cannot, if it is\r\n   urged upon him by some friend, or brought up against him by some\r\n   opponent, he draws himself up, looks sternly at the objector,\r\n   and then says the very same thing as before, only with a louder\r\n   voice and more confident manner. He becomes more intensely and\r\n   enthusiastically positive, by way of making up for the\r\n   interruption, of braving the confutation, and of showing the\r\n   world that nothing whatever in the universe will ever make him\r\n   think one hair-breadth more favourably than he does think, than\r\n   he ever has thought, and than his family ever thought before\r\n   him. About our state of mind, our views of things, our ends and\r\n   objects, our doctrines, our defence of them, he absolutely\r\n   refuses to be enlightened.... The most overwhelming refutations\r\n   of the calumnies brought against us do us no good at all. We\r\n   were tempted, perhaps, to say to ourselves, 'What _will_ they\r\n   have to say in answer to this? Now at last the falsehood is put\r\n   down for ever, it will never show its face again.' Vain hope!\r\n   Such is the virtue of prejudice--it is ever reproductive; future\r\n   story-tellers and wonder-mongers, as yet unknown to fame, are\r\n   below the horizon, and will unfold their tale of horror, each in\r\n   his day, in long succession.\"\r\n\r\n   ... \"Perhaps it is wrong to compare sin with sin, but I declare\r\n   to you, the more I think of it, the more intimately does this\r\n   Prejudice seem to me to corrupt the soul, even beyond those sins\r\n   which are commonly called more deadly. And why? because it\r\n   argues so astonishing a want of mere natural charity or love of\r\n   our kind. They can be considerate in all matters of this life,\r\n   friendly in social intercourse, charitable to the poor and\r\n   outcast, merciful towards criminals, nay, kind towards the\r\n   inferior creation, towards their cows, and horses, and swine;\r\n   yet, as regards us, who bear the same form, speak the same\r\n   tongue, breathe the same air, and walk the same streets,\r\n   ruthless, relentless, believing ill of us, and wishing to\r\n   believe it. They are tenacious of what they believe, they are\r\n   impatient of being argued with, they are angry at being\r\n   contradicted, they are disappointed when a point is cleared up;\r\n   they had rather that _we_ should be guilty than _they_ mistaken;\r\n   they have no wish at all we should not be unprincipled rogues\r\n   and bloodthirsty demons. They are kinder even to their dogs and\r\n   their cats than to us. Is it not true? can it be denied? is it\r\n   not portentous? does it not argue an incompleteness or hiatus in\r\n   the very structure of their moral nature? has not something, in\r\n   their case, dropped out of the list of natural qualities proper\r\n   to man?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese sentences, many of them, might be used now to describe\r\nAnti-vivisection at its lowest level. It might keep a higher level:\r\nbut we have seen that the literature, arguments, and general methods\r\nof the Anti-vivisection Societies fail to do that. The Parliamentary\r\ninterviewer, the itinerant lecturer, and the letter-writer, are not,\r\nafter all, of much help to any cause: and surely it is time, after all\r\nthis waste of huge sums of money, that a Royal Commission should\r\ninquire, not only into experiments on animals, but also into\r\nAnti-vivisection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    A, Certificate, 268, 286\r\n\r\n    _Abolitionist_, the, 302\r\n\r\n    Absorbable ligature, the, 264\r\n\r\n    Act 39 & 40 Vict. c. 77, 267-293\r\n\r\n    Actinomycosis, 246\r\n\r\n    Adrenalin, 263\r\n\r\n    Aga Khan, Sir, 179\r\n\r\n    Air, compressed, 71\r\n\r\n    Algeria, malaria in, 230\r\n\r\n    America, diphtheria in, 109;\r\n      tetanus in, 133, 135;\r\n      yellow fever in, 232-240\r\n\r\n    Amoy, plague in, 194\r\n\r\n    Amyl nitrite, 254;\r\n      false argument, 345\r\n\r\n    Anaemia, 71;\r\n      pernicious, 263\r\n\r\n    Anæsthesia, grades of, 357;\r\n      false statements, 366\r\n\r\n    Anæsthetics, discovery and study of, 55, 256;\r\n      use under the Act, 281\r\n\r\n    Anderson, Mr., 190\r\n\r\n    Andrews, Staff-Surgeon, 263\r\n\r\n    Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Africans, 228\r\n\r\n    Animal heat, 68\r\n\r\n    Animals, protective inoculation of, 89-95, 113;\r\n      action of drugs on, 255\r\n\r\n    Annett, Dr., 223\r\n\r\n    Anopheles and Culex, 214-242\r\n\r\n    Anthrax, 76, 87-95\r\n\r\n    Antiseptics, 78-86;\r\n      use of under the Act, 285\r\n\r\n    Antitoxins, testing of, 270;\r\n      false arguments against, 338-342.\r\n      See also Diphtheria, Tetanus, &c.\r\n\r\n    Anti-vivisection Societies, 297 _sqq._;\r\n      dissensions, 299-302;\r\n      expenditure, 304-306, 334, 367;\r\n      acceptance of all advantages from past discoveries, 307;\r\n      attitude toward sport, 308;\r\n      toward doctors and hospitals, 310;\r\n      literature, 313-324;\r\n      method of espionage, 327;\r\n      general arguments, 326-334;\r\n      special arguments, 335-367;\r\n      electoral and parliamentary tactics, 367-371\r\n\r\n    Aphasia, 62\r\n\r\n    Arguments, anti-vivisection, 326-367\r\n\r\n    Aristotle, 3, 44, 243\r\n\r\n    Arloing and Courmont, 100\r\n\r\n    Artificial respiration, 264\r\n\r\n    Asellius, 19\r\n\r\n    Assam-Burmah railway, cholera on, 162\r\n\r\n    Athens, Pasteur Institute at, 143\r\n\r\n    Aubertin, 62\r\n\r\n\r\n    B\r\n\r\n    B, Certificate, 268, 349.\r\n      See also Experiments\r\n\r\n    Baccelli, Prof., 133\r\n\r\n    Bacteriology, 77 _sqq._;\r\n      not before the 1875 Commission,\r\n      75; the foundation of Lister's work, 85;\r\n      hardly recognised in the wording of the Act, 267;\r\n      the cause of more than 90 per cent, of all experiments, 292;\r\n      false statements, 316, 340\r\n\r\n    Baginsky, Prof., 105\r\n\r\n    Bagshawe, Bishop, 329\r\n\r\n    Bainbridge, Surgeon-General, 169\r\n\r\n    Baker, Major, 172\r\n\r\n    Bang, Prof., 99\r\n\r\n    Bannerman, Major, 173, 175, 178\r\n\r\n    Barbadoes, filariasis in, 240\r\n\r\n    Barry, Bishop, 343\r\n\r\n    Battipaglia-Reggio railway, and malaria, 221\r\n\r\n    Bazan, Dr., 42\r\n\r\n    Beaumont, Dr. William, 28\r\n\r\n    Behring, Prof., 102\r\n\r\n    Belchier, Mr., 40\r\n\r\n    Belgaum, plague at, 174\r\n\r\n    Bell, Sir Charles, 46, 57, 65\r\n\r\n    Bell, Dr., 88\r\n\r\n    Belladonna, action of, 255\r\n\r\n    van Beneden, 244\r\n\r\n    Berdoe, Mr., 314 _sqq._\r\n\r\n    Bernard, Claude, 24, 30, 56, 248, 254, 282\r\n\r\n    Bernard Shaw, Mr., 330\r\n\r\n    Beveridge, Surgeon, 263\r\n\r\n    Beyrout, experiments at, 214\r\n\r\n    Bezoar-stone, the, 252\r\n\r\n    Bichat, 253\r\n\r\n    Bilaspur, cholera at, 164\r\n\r\n    Bircher, Dr., 249\r\n\r\n    Bird-malaria, 217, 218\r\n\r\n    Birt, Surgeon-Major, 212\r\n\r\n    Bloemfontein, typhoid at, 203\r\n\r\n    Blondlot, 29\r\n\r\n    Blood, circulation of the, 3-10;\r\n      blood-pressure, 11-16, 70;\r\n      collateral circulation, 13\r\n\r\n    Blood-letting, rational use of, 264\r\n\r\n    \"Blood-poisoning,\" 84\r\n\r\n    Board of Agriculture laboratories, 288\r\n\r\n    Board Hospitals, diphtheria in, 116\r\n\r\n    Boehmer, 42\r\n\r\n    Bohn, 37\r\n\r\n    Böllinger, 246\r\n\r\n    Bombay, plague in, 170\r\n\r\n    Bone, growth of, 40, 55;\r\n      transplantation of, 264\r\n\r\n    Borelli, 25\r\n\r\n    Borrel, 168\r\n\r\n    Bouillard, 62\r\n\r\n    Brain, localisation of functions, 59-67;\r\n      not sensitive to touch, 65, 285;\r\n      false argument against experiments on, 336;\r\n      surgery of, 337\r\n\r\n    Brieger, 153\r\n\r\n    Broca, 59\r\n\r\n    Brown, Captain Harold, 162\r\n\r\n    Brown-Séquard, Prof., 56\r\n\r\n    Bruce, Major, 211\r\n\r\n    Brunton, Sir T.
