For size, compare with the men shown\r\n    in the foreground.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\n=Food is the need of the day—of every day.=\r\n\r\n=Food is the need of the future.=\r\n\r\n=From the beginning of the world food production= has been the most\r\nimportant of the activities of man—but food production has frequently\r\ntaken uneconomic channels. Even before the war in Europe started, the\r\ntendency toward changing standards in food production was marked.\r\n\r\nIn one of America’s leading periodicals, we read: “=Tree crops is the\r\nnext big thing in farming=,” says J. Russel Smith, after =an 18,000–mile\r\njourney through the nut growing countries=.\r\n\r\nThe man who is alert to changing food standards, who realizes how\r\nlargely the cattle herds of the world have been depleted during the\r\nWorld War, who has learned how long it will be before they can be built\r\nup, will see in this condition an opportunity paralleled only in a small\r\nway by the noted investment opportunities of the past.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred years ago the =railroad= offered an investment\r\nopportunity which the Vanderbilts were wise enough to see—and to\r\nseize. You know that the Vanderbilt wealth has lasted through\r\ngenerations—increasing year by year.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago there was a similar opportunity offered in\r\n=steel=—demanded by the rapidly growing industries. The names of\r\nCarnegie and Schwab head the list of the famous “thousand steel\r\nmillionaires”—made rich by foresight.\r\n\r\nForty years ago =electricity= offered its opportunities to Edison—and to\r\nmany others who have become extremely wealthy because they combined\r\ncourage with foresight.\r\n\r\nMarvelous as have been the fortunes in =railroads=, in =steel= and in\r\n=electricity=, we are today, says the Luther Burbank Society in its\r\nbook, “Give the Boy a Chance,” “facing an opportunity four hundred times\r\nbigger than the railroad opportunity was a hundred years ago, eight\r\nhundred times bigger than electricity offered at its inception, fifteen\r\nhundred times bigger than the steel opportunity which Mr. Carnegie\r\nfound—=because agriculture is just by these amounts bigger than those\r\nother industries=.”\r\n\r\nFrom land—the most permanent basis of wealth—immense fortunes of today\r\nand tomorrow are being drawn. America is beginning to see a new\r\nvision,—its agriculture is taking a newer, more profitable form.\r\n\r\n=What is the Biggest Future in Agriculture?= When James J. Hill staked\r\nhis all in apples and received in return a profit estimated at ten\r\nmillion dollars—he was merely a pioneer in the new type of farming.\r\n\r\nYet the pecan comes into bearing as early as the apple orchard and\r\nremains in bearing many times as long, says Bulletin No. 41, of the\r\nAlabama Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly significant that the strongest advocates of tree\r\nagriculture are those familiar with conditions in nut growing countries.\r\nConsider that fact in connection with this statement of Luther Burbank,\r\nthe Edison of Agriculture: “=Paper Shell Pecans of the improved\r\nvarieties are the most delicious, as well as the most nutritious nuts in\r\nthe world. They are higher in food value than any other nuts, either\r\nnative or foreign.=”\r\n\r\nIn a prominent agricultural weekly we read: “The tree that yields a\r\npound or two of nuts at five years of age is counted upon for twenty to\r\nfifty pounds by the tenth year, and after that the yield grows beyond\r\nanything known in fruit trees, because the Pecan at maturity is a forest\r\ngiant.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of such facts, is it not wise to consider carefully the\r\ninteresting facts on Paper Shell Pecans found within?\r\n\r\n                          =ELAM G. HESS, Manheim, Lancaster County, Pa.=\r\n       =Keystone Pecan Orchard       =President Keystone Pecan Company=\r\n            Plantations=\r\n   =in Southwest Georgia—Calhoun,    =Pennsylvania State Vice President\r\n     Dougherty, Lee and Mitchell           of National Nut Growers\r\n              Counties=                         Association=\r\n\r\n “_Pecan production is destined to become one of the most important lines\r\n    of orchard development in the United States._”—Cong. Record of the\r\n                     United States, p. 1101, Vol. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Right Foods—The Increasing Demand\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter what may happen, the demand for nourishing foods is sure to\r\ngrow so long as the population increases. Railroads, steel,\r\nelectricity—all are recent developments, none of them indispensable to\r\nmankind. =But existence itself depends on nourishing foods.=\r\n\r\n“Then,” you say, “no business should be surer than that of supplying\r\nfood to the growing population of America.”\r\n\r\nCorrect, provided you supply the right food.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Food standards are changing]\r\n\r\nFor food standards are changing. Prove that fact, if you will, by the\r\nfigures of the U. S. Census Bureau for the years 1900 and 1910, a period\r\nunaffected by the World War.\r\n\r\nDuring that period the population of the United States increased from\r\n75,091,575 to 91,972,266—an increase of virtually 22–3⁄10 per cent.\r\nTherefore, the production of any foodstuffs should increase by the same\r\npercentage during that period to provide for the same consumption per\r\ncapita.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Less beef, less pork, more nut meat]\r\n\r\nHas the consumption of beef increased during that period? Apparently\r\nnot—for there were 8.7 per cent. less cattle on the farms in 1910 than\r\nin 1900. Nor was there any material increase in imports. That there was\r\nnot a corresponding increase in the price of beef during this period, is\r\nindicated by the fact that the value of all cattle on American farms\r\nincreased only 1.6 per cent. between 1900 and 1910—an increase only\r\none-fourteenth as great as the increase in population.\r\n\r\nThere was a loss of 7.4 per cent. in the number of swine on American\r\nfarms and a decrease of 14.7 per cent, in the number of sheep—the\r\ninevitable result of which loss while population was increasing to the\r\nextent of 22–3⁄10 per cent. was an increase in price per pound in pork,\r\nham, bacon, mutton, etc., which automatically cut off a large part of\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A loss of twenty-nine pounds per capita on animal flesh]\r\n\r\nWhen urging the necessity for close study of the food problem, President\r\nWilson pointed out the fact that during a ten-year period there had been\r\na loss of 29 pounds of animal flesh per capita per year. With such a\r\nrecord it is obvious that some foods to replace meats must be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Why Spend Millions For Imported Nuts?\r\n\r\n  “We are annually importing between 60,000,000 and 70,000,000 pounds\r\n  of nuts at a cost of between $12,000,000 and $13,000,000, while we\r\n  export nuts worth less than a half million dollars. _Why should we\r\n  spend millions of dollars each year in buying nuts from foreign\r\n  countries, when we can grow the pecan, the equal of any other nut,\r\n  either native or foreign, in unlimited quantities?_”—Congressional\r\n  Record of the United States, Vol. 54, No. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Poultry Gains Fail to Equal Increase of Population\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry was the only exception among meats to this history of\r\ndiminishing supply, increased prices and diminishing demand. Yet the\r\ngain in the number of all fowls on American farms was only 17 per cent.,\r\nwhile the population was increasing 22.3 per cent. The American\r\nproduction of nut foods was increasing 55.7 per cent. in the same period\r\nwithout beginning to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nThough the increase in value of the American nut crop was 128.1 per\r\ncent., still the increase in consumption required an increase in imports\r\nso great that in 1910 America was supplying only one-fourth of the nuts\r\nit was eating; while in 1900 it supplied half.\r\n\r\n  Government figures, taken from a leading nut publication, show that\r\n  in 1900 the value of nuts imported into the United States was\r\n  $3,484,651. By 1910 it had risen to $12,775,196, which is 365% of\r\n  1900 importations, although the population of the United States\r\n  increased only 22.3% during that ten-year period.\r\n\r\n  In 1919 there were $57,499,044 worth of nuts imported, which is 450%\r\n  of the importations in 1910, although the 1920 census shows an\r\n  increase of only 15% in population since 1910. Nut importations in\r\n  1919 are 1650% of those in 1900, while population increased only 40%\r\n  between 1900 and 1920.\r\n\r\n  We see, therefore, that there is a gain in nut importations between\r\n  1900 and 1910 twelve times as great as the gain in population; that\r\n  the later increase is so great that this gain between 1900 and 1919\r\n  is 39 times as great as the increase in population. Surely this is\r\n  conclusive evidence of the great increase in nut consumption in the\r\n  United States, when we remember how greatly the American nut crop\r\n  was increasing during this period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nut consumption increases thirty-nine times as greatly as\r\n           population]\r\n\r\nThese authentic figures astonish even the man who has learned by\r\nexperience that “=nut meat is the real meat=” of greatest food value;\r\nfor they show what great number of his fellow countrymen have proved\r\ntheir belief in the same fact. The man who has looked upon nuts as a\r\nholiday diet alone, cannot fail to see his error, when he realizes that\r\nthis increase in the importation of nut meats in 1919 compared to 1900\r\nis nearly nine times as great as the increase in population; despite the\r\nlargely increasing American production.\r\n\r\nHigher education in food values has led people to realize the necessity\r\nfor different and more varied diet—and this educational development has\r\nbeen facilitated also by economic conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The public forced to cut down on animal flesh—grazing land\r\n           scarcer]\r\n\r\nAs population increases, land becomes more valuable. As land becomes\r\nmore valuable—intensive farming is practiced. Grazing becomes virtually\r\nimpossible under such conditions; and, despite all the efforts of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture experts, cattle raising is pushed farther and\r\nfarther from the large centers of population. Increased transportation\r\nand costs of refrigeration mean increased meat prices—even the\r\nimportation of large quantities of South American beef between 1910 and\r\n1914, for instance, failed to keep meat at a price low enough so that it\r\ncould constitute the large food element which it once was on the\r\nAmerican table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “Shall We Cease to Eat Meat?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Available supply of pork, beef and mutton shrinking]\r\n\r\nasks Field Illustrated for March, 1919. A question of great\r\nsignificance, from a publication of unquestioned leadership on\r\nscientific cattle breeding. A question graphically illustrated by this\r\nself-explanatory chart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                     OUR AVAILABLE MEAT SUPPLY (PER\r\n                              INDIVIDUAL)\r\n\r\n                              IN 1880 WAS\r\n                                   HOGS CATTLE SHEEP\r\n                             1           7⁄10  7⁄10\r\n\r\n                                IN 1900\r\n                           8⁄10          9⁄10  6⁄10\r\n\r\n                                IN 1917\r\n                           6⁄10          6⁄10    ½\r\n\r\n                    SHALL WE CEASE TO EAT MEAT\r\n                             OR DRINK MILK\r\n                              OR WEAR WOOLEN CLOTHES\r\n\r\n                   Copyright 1919, Field Illustrated\r\n\r\nField Illustrated shows that, the country over, it takes an average of\r\nthree acres to support a single full grown cow through the summer season\r\nalone. It shows that wheat is the great competitor of the meat crop,\r\nthat wheat has driven livestock from the western ranges, and that during\r\nthe past four years wheat has been driving the dairy cows and the beef\r\nsteer from the eastern and middle western farms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Animals must not compete with human beings for cereal foods]\r\n\r\n“Whenever there is pressure for food,” concludes Field Illustrated, “and\r\nanimals must compete with humans for the cereal products of the fields,\r\nthen animals are pretty likely to lose out. =An acre of corn will feed\r\nten times as many people in the form of Johnny Cakes as it would if\r\nconverted into meat.=”\r\n\r\nThis statement is in striking accord with the conclusions reached by\r\nGraham Lusk, one of the two American representatives to the Inter-Allied\r\nScientific Food Commission, who wrote in December, 1918, “=It is,\r\ntherefore, axiomatic that in times of scarcity one must not give to pigs\r\nfood which can nourish human beings.=” For further data, see pages 14\r\nand 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Why America Must Eat Less Animal Flesh\r\n\r\n\r\nThe call of the United States Food Administration for =meatless days=,\r\nfor =porkless days= and for =every day a fat saving day=, taught a\r\nlesson that America will never forget.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Americans use twice as much animal flesh as any European\r\n           nation]\r\n\r\nFood experts have for years emphasized the fact that Americans eat too\r\nmuch animal flesh. Physical Culture says:\r\n\r\n  “About forty per cent. of our American bill of fare is of animal\r\n  origin. In England the percentage is but twenty per cent. of the\r\n  total food, in Continental Europe it is less, and in Japan it is not\r\n  more than five per cent. Yet the Japanese have astounded the world\r\n  in every test of endurance.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excessive in cost, wasteful, and the cause of illness]\r\n\r\n  “‘The American soldier is eating 100 per cent. too much meat,’ said\r\n  the world famous Dr. Wiley; while Dr. Gordon J. Saxon, director of\r\n  the laboratory for cancer of the Oncologic Hospital, Philadelphia,\r\n  was quoted by the Philadelphia North American as ascribing the\r\n  wonderful resistive powers of the French soldiers to the fact that\r\n  they lived on a meagre supply of high protein foods, like animal\r\n  flesh, and were given an abundance of fats and carbohydrates. He\r\n  laid stress on the excessive cost of our American diet with its high\r\n  ‘animal intake,’ and this was also emphasized by the booklet, ‘War\r\n  Economy in Food,’ issued by the U. S. Food Administration, which\r\n  characterized animal flesh as the most expensive of staple foods in\r\n  proportion to food value.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fat is needed; securing it through eating animal flesh is the\r\n           source of trouble]\r\n\r\nAmericans are just learning that the cause of most of their bodily\r\nailments is the securing of fat by eating animal flesh. As the Literary\r\nDigest well says in its March 9th, 1918, issue:\r\n\r\n  “_Fats are chiefly valuable as fuel for the body. But in addition to\r\n  being consumed and turned to energy, fats are also readily stored\r\n  away by the body, alongside muscle and bone; as a reserve in times\r\n  of illness or physical exertion._\r\n\r\n  Chief among the functions of protein is its importance as a builder\r\n  of bodily tissues. It is structural. The part it plays is like that\r\n  of iron in a locomotive.”\r\n\r\nOnce built, the body, like the locomotive, needs only sufficient\r\nbuilding material (protein) to rebuild wornout portions; but it needs\r\nmotive material (fat) in far greater proportion. =Yet high animal flesh\r\ndiet=, which has been the American custom, =puts into the system a far\r\ngreater amount of protein than is needed and too little fat=. The system\r\ncannot absorb this excess protein, and sluggishness, intestinal\r\nderangements, autointoxication and flesh-borne diseases are the\r\ninevitable result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fat is essential to withstand exposure]\r\n\r\n“=Fat is fuel for Fighters=,” said the U. S. Food Administration. It\r\nurged civilians to avoid waste of fats because fats are necessary to\r\nthose who must withstand extremes of climate, stand in water-soaked\r\ntrenches and indulge in extreme physical activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two to four ounces daily are needed]\r\n\r\nAs Good Health for March, 1918, pointed out, “=Fats are fuel foods! The\r\ndaily requirement is two to four ounces.=”\r\n\r\nThere is a way to get this required quantity of fat without the\r\nexcessive protein intake which is the inevitable result of our high\r\nanimal flesh diet. By following this plan America can multiply its\r\nindustrial efficiency, and benefit the physical welfare of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Nut Meat Gives Fat and all Needed Protein\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his speech to the National Nut Growers’ Association, at Biloxi,\r\nMississippi, Dr. Kellogg emphasized the necessity for fuel foods and the\r\nneed for less proteins and albumens. He said:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nut production destined to exceed animal industry]\r\n\r\n  “To nuts, then, we must look for the future sustenance of the\r\n  race.... Half a century hence the nut crop will far exceed in volume\r\n  and in value our present animal industry.”\r\n\r\n  He emphasizes the fact that all experiments have proved that “Nut\r\n  protein is the best of all sources upon which the body may draw for\r\n  its supplies of tissue building material,” while at another point he\r\n  adds, “On account of their high fat content they are the most highly\r\n  concentrated of all natural foods.” At great length, he compares the\r\n  ease of assimilation of nut fats with that of the other source of\r\n  fat, and concludes, “nut fats are far more digestible than animal\r\n  fats.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecans supply the proper ratio of fat and protein]\r\n\r\nNecessity is the mother of invention. If America had utilized in the\r\npast its full opportunities to grow pecans—the best of all nuts in high\r\nfat content with the perfect ratio of protein—we could have shipped to\r\nour soldiers abroad the nourishment most needed in most condensed form,\r\nprotected from all contamination and free from all putrefactive\r\nbacteria. It would require approximately a tenth of the cargo space and\r\nwould need no refrigeration. It would require no cooking; could be\r\nmunched on the march, and would be assimilated more readily than animal\r\nfats and proteins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The public is changing from animal fats]\r\n\r\nIt requires but a glance at any newspaper or magazine to realize that\r\nvegetable fats are taking the place of animal fats—and that the source\r\nof virtually all the new products along this line is nut oil, peanuts\r\nand cocoanuts being the largest sources of supply to date. Our 1915\r\nPecan Book quoted Prof. H. Harold Hume, then State Horticulturist of\r\nFlorida, Glen St. Mary, Fla., as saying:\r\n\r\n  “According to analysis, the Pecan is richer in fat than any other\r\n  nuts—70 per cent. of the kernel is fat. The pecan may at some time\r\n  be in requisition as a source of oil—an oil which would doubtless be\r\n  useful for salad purposes—but it is never likely to be converted\r\n  into oil until the present prices of nuts are greatly reduced.”\r\n\r\nSince then pecan prices have had a decided tendency to increase because\r\nthe demand is growing more rapidly than the supply; and the chances of\r\nthe pecan being used for oil are more remote than ever. Yet one of the\r\ngreat reasons for the increase in demand is increasing public knowledge\r\nof the pecan and its wonderful food value. For the pecan is proved\r\nricher in fat than any other nut, with the right proportion of easily\r\nassimilated protein, and free from any irritating membrane such as makes\r\nsome nuts difficult of digestion by those who have weak stomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Nut Meat is Superior to Animal Flesh\r\n\r\n\r\nNut meat is Nature’s food product for supplying fats and proteins,\r\nsuperior in every way to animal flesh. Dr. Kellogg, of the Battle Creek\r\nSanitarium, said:\r\n\r\n  “Nuts are rich in fat and protein. On account of their high fat\r\n  content they are the most highly concentrated of all natural foods.\r\n  _A pound of nuts contains on an average more than 3,000 calories or\r\n  food units, double the amount supplied by grains, four times as much\r\n  as average meats and ten times as much as average fruits or\r\n  vegetables._”\r\n\r\nFor example, according to Jaffi’s table, ten different kinds of our\r\ncommon nuts contain on an average 20.7% of protein, 53% of fat, and 18%\r\nof carbohydrate. Among all nuts the pecan has the largest percentage of\r\nfat and the best balanced proportion of protein, analysis showing 12%\r\nprotein, 70% fat, and 18% carbohydrate.\r\n\r\nMeat (round steaks) gives 19.8% of protein and 15.6% of fat, with no\r\ncarbohydrate. =A pound of average nuts contains the equivalent of a\r\npound of beefsteak and, in addition, nearly a pound of butter and a\r\nthird of a loaf of bread.= The nut is, in fact, a sort of vegetable\r\nmeat. Its composition is much the same as that of fat meat, only it is\r\nin much more concentrated form.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the nut is a highly concentrated food, the question\r\nnaturally arises, can the body utilize the energy stored in nuts as\r\nreadily as that supplied by meat products?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nut meat is readily digestible]\r\n\r\nThe notion that nuts are difficult of digestion has really no foundation\r\nin fact. The idea is probably the natural outgrowth of the custom of\r\neating nuts at the close of a meal when an abundance, more likely a\r\nsuperabundance of highly nutritious foods has already been eaten, and\r\nthe equally injurious custom of eating nuts between meals. Neglect of\r\nthorough mastication must also be mentioned as a possible cause of\r\nindigestion following the use of nuts.\r\n\r\n“=The fat of nuts exists in a finely divided state, and in chewing of\r\nnuts a fine emulsion is produced so that nuts enter the stomach in a\r\nform best adapted for prompt digestion=,” says Dr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Pecans Furnish The Balanced Ration\r\n\r\n  “_The pecan is a nut of immense economic value._ The pecan furnishes\r\n  practically a balanced ration. It is a highly concentrated and\r\n  highly nutritious food. _Compared with round steak, it contains\r\n  one-twelfth as much water, two-thirds as much protein, from four to\r\n  six times as much fat and has between three and four times as great\r\n  fuel value._\r\n\r\n  _Pecans contain most of the elements essential to the building of\r\n  the frame and body tissues._ The food value of pecans is rapidly\r\n  becoming generally recognized, and it will not be long before the\r\n  pecan will be extensively used not only as a substitute for certain\r\n  classes of food, such as meats, but also a substitute for food of\r\n  all classes.”—U. S. Congressional Record, Jan. 12, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Nuts—A Staple, Necessary Food\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Long valued for diabetics—a good food for all]\r\n\r\n“There are abundant indications,” says the Journal of the American\r\nMedical Association for September 21, 1918, “that nuts, which have long\r\nfound a valued place in the dietary of the diabetic without detriment to\r\nhis health, will grow in popularity as foods for the well.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “Not luxuries—but among the most nutritive of foods”]\r\n\r\n“The exigencies of war time have emphasized anew those properties of\r\nnuts as foods which remove them from the category of luxuries and place\r\nthem on the list of substantial components of the day’s ration,” it adds\r\nin its editorial comments on the experiments of Professor Cajori, of\r\nYale University. “It should be remembered,” it states, “that bulk for\r\nbulk they (nuts) belong among the most nutritive foods ordinarily\r\navailable.”\r\n\r\nOpposing the prejudice that nuts are difficult of digestion, it adds,\r\n“=Cajori’s studies lead him to the conclusion that if nuts are eaten\r\nproperly and used in the diet as are eggs, meats and other foods rich in\r\nprotein, they have a physiological value on a par with that of staple\r\narticles=.” Only in the case of the chestnut—because of its large starch\r\ncontent—was cooking desirable.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon this article, Good Health Magazine for January, 1918,\r\nsays: “=For nearly half a century we have advocated the use of nuts as a\r\nstaple element of the dietary of man=.”\r\n\r\nAs Good Health points out, these conclusions of Professor Cajori are in\r\nharmony with the suggestions of the United States Food Administration\r\nthat nuts “should be counted as part of the necessary food and not eaten\r\nas an extra.” “We are led to believe,” adds Good Health, “that the\r\noccasional indigestion following injudicious eating of cheese and nuts\r\nis probably often due to forgetting that they are very substantial\r\nfoods, and eating them at the end of an already substantial meal.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ideal food for nursing mothers]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Dr. Hoobler, of Detroit, Michigan, in the Woman’s\r\nHospital and Infant’s Home, showed that for nursing mothers a diet\r\nconsisting largely, 50%, of nuts, was far superior to any other dietary,\r\nand in every particular giving nearly 15% greater flow of milk, with 30%\r\ngreater food value, and that the mothers took the diet readily and\r\nenjoyed it.

This is because the ordinary\r\n  foodstuffs other than meat contain a sufficient amount of protein to\r\n  meet the needs of the body. Nuts present their protein in\r\n  combination with so large a proportion of easily digestible fat that\r\n  there is comparatively little danger of getting an excess,” states\r\n  Dr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\n  “_In face of vanishing supply of animal flesh it is most comforting\r\n  to know that meats of all sorts may be safely replaced by nuts not\r\n  only without loss, but with a decided gain_,” he adds.\r\n\r\nAmong the other advantages of nuts and animal flesh which Dr. Kellogg\r\ncites are the freedom from waste products such as uric acid, urea,\r\ncarmine, etc., which cause so many human ills.\r\n\r\nNuts are clean, sweet and aseptic, free from putrefactive bacteria;\r\nwhile ordinary flesh foods contain three to thirty million putrefactive\r\nbacteria per ounce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nuts—clean, sweet and pure—do not deteriorate like animal\r\n           flesh]\r\n\r\nNuts are free from trichinæ, tape worm and parasites, and from the\r\npossibility of carrying specific disease which is always present with\r\nanimal flesh. “=Nuts=,” says Dr. Kellogg, “=are in good health when\r\ngathered and remain so till eaten=.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Nuts—The Safer Source of Protein\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why add to your load the burden of the tired steer?]\r\n\r\n“Beefsteak has a certain food value,” says Good Health for January,\r\n1919, “though far less than is generally attributed to it, =but in\r\naddition it embodies toxic elements, waste products from the animal’s\r\nbody, contained in the venous blood, always poisonous, which gives the\r\nbeefsteak its red color=.”\r\n\r\n“These elements are muscle poisons and brain poisons. They cause fatigue\r\nin the animal from which they are derived and in the man who eats them.”\r\n\r\n“An experiment by the late Victor Horsley, a London surgeon, proved that\r\nin concentrated form these poisons completely paralyze the brain cells.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “Do we need meat?” asks Alfred W. McCann, famous food\r\n           authority]\r\n\r\n“=Do we need meat?=” asks Alfred W. McCann, noted food authority, in\r\nPhysical Culture. He answers his own question by pointing to conclusive\r\nproof of Anthony Bassler and others, that the human system cannot\r\nutilize over two ounces of protein a day. Yet four ounces of beefsteak,\r\nroast beef, pork or lamb chops, etc., contain all the protein the system\r\ncan utilize, while cereals, milk, eggs, nuts, etc., add to the quantity.\r\nHe proves by the figures of former Secretary Houston, of the U. S. Dept.\r\nof Agriculture, and of Dr. Clyde L. King, University of Pennsylvania,\r\nthat Americans consume 80 grams of protein daily, compared to 44 grams\r\nfor France before the war; 14 grams for Japan; 26 for Russia; 27 for\r\nAustria. He indicts Americans as “Kidneycides,” overtaxing the kidneys\r\nby this excess protein diet, and bringing on constipation, biliousness,\r\nheadache, catarrh, rheumatism, etc. He emphasizes the disadvantages of\r\nanimal flesh as a source of protein, shows how vegetable sources of\r\nprotein are purer and safer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “No” answers the world’s most authoritative food body]\r\n\r\nThe Inter-Allied Scientific Food Commission, the most authoritative food\r\nbody ever gathered, “=voted that meat was not a physiological\r\nnecessity=.” Dr. Graham Lusk, one of the American Commissioners to that\r\nbody, suggests cutting the American meat ration in half. That this is\r\nreadily possible is shown by the November, 1919, Monthly Crop Report of\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture. Page 116 gives the annual\r\naverage meat consumption in the United States as 179.9 pounds per\r\ncapita—while best authorities agree with the statement of Alfred W.\r\nMcCann that 91 pounds would be more than ample. Dr. Lusk comments on the\r\nfact that in England “The reduction of meat in the dietary produced no\r\nunfavorable results.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Grow Pecans—The Ideal “Fat” Food\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in an address at Biloxi, October, 1917, said that the\r\nofficials of the United States Department of Agriculture foresaw this\r\ncondition and the increasing prices for animal flesh over twenty years\r\nago. Since then the increase of our human population and the decrease of\r\nour animal population has so greatly exceeded their estimated figures\r\nthat the question, “=Is meat imperative to complete nutrition?=” has\r\nbecome an imminent one.\r\n\r\nAnimal flesh supplies protein and fat. We have shown on page 10 how nuts\r\nsupply the necessary fat and protein. Dr. Kellogg emphasizes the fact\r\nthat nuts supply proteins of such a character that they render complete\r\nthe proteins of cereals and vegetable foods.\r\n\r\n“=This discovery is one of the highest importance since it opens a door\r\nof escape for the race from the threatened extinction by starvation at\r\nsome future period, perhaps not so very remote=,” adds Dr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nine-tenths of our corn fed to animals]\r\n\r\n  “From an economic standpoint,” he adds, “the rearing of animals for\r\n  food is a monstrous extravagance. According to Professor Henry, Dean\r\n  of the Agricultural Department of the University of Wisconsin, and\r\n  author of an authoritative work on foods and feeding, one hundred\r\n  pounds of food fed to a steer produces less than three pounds of\r\n  food in the form of flesh. In other words, we must feed the steer\r\n  thirty-three pounds of corn in order to get back one pound of food\r\n  in the form of steak. Such an extravagant waste can be tolerated\r\n  only so long as it is possible to produce a large excess of\r\n  foodstuffs. It is stated, as a matter of fact, that at the present\r\n  time scarcely more than ten per cent. of the corn raised in the\r\n  United States is directly consumed by human beings. A large part of\r\n  it is wasted in feeding to animals. This economic loss has been long\r\n  known to practical men, but it has been regarded as unavoidable\r\n  since meat has been supposed to be absolutely essential as an\r\n  article of food.”\r\n\r\n  “Think of it,” comments Good Health, for June, 1918, “100 pounds of\r\n  perfectly good corn, in exchange for three pounds of beef, _and the\r\n  pound of beef when obtained is worth less as a food than a pound of\r\n  the original corn_. Ninety-seven pounds wasted just to satisfy a\r\n  cultivated appetite, _or appetite based on ignorance_.”\r\n\r\n“In view of these facts,” stated Dr. Kellogg, “it is most interesting to\r\nknow that =in nuts, the most neglected of all well known food products,\r\nwe find the assurance of an ample and complete food supply for all\r\nfuture time, even though necessity should compel the total abandonment\r\nof all our present forms of animal industry=.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seven or eight million acres of nut trees would supply all\r\n           needed fats]\r\n\r\n“The planting of seven or eight million acres of nut trees might supply\r\nthe whole country with an abundance of fat, so that it would no longer\r\nbe necessary to waste corn in feeding to pigs to obtain an inferior\r\nquality of fat,” says Good Health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A panoramic view in our large orchards, showing a fraction of one side\r\n    which is not illustrated in the other pictures. Can you, looking\r\n    forward fifteen years or more, see in this a picture of your own\r\n    pecan unit trees sturdy and healthy, their branches thickly covered\r\n    with pecans, filling out under the summer sun?

Of course,\r\nno thinking man would claim that every acre of pasturage is available\r\nfor nut raising; but where the change can be made, that gain is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n  As Dr. Kellogg points out, it takes two acres two years to produce a\r\n  steer weighing 600 pounds; an average of 150 pounds per year per\r\n  acre. The same acre planted to walnut trees would, he states,\r\n  produce 100 pounds per tree per year for the first twenty years;\r\n  which means 4,000 pounds of nuts from an acre of 40 trees. The food\r\n  value of the 150 pounds of steer cannot exceed 150,000 calories or\r\n  food units; while the nut meat from the same acre equals 3,000,000\r\n  calories in food value. As Dr. Kellogg concludes, “_Twenty times as\r\n  much food from the nut trees as from the fattened steer, and food of\r\n  the same general character, but of superior quality_.”\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Kellogg previously pointed out: “=A pound of pecans is worth more\r\nin nutritive value than two pounds of pork chops, three pounds of\r\nsalmon, two and a half pounds of turkey or five pounds of veal=.”\r\n\r\nWhile the price of nuts is by some considered high, Dr. Kellogg directs\r\nattention to the fact that “=even at present prices the choicest\r\nvarieties of nuts are cheaper than meats if equivalent food values are\r\ncompared=.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nuts as a Substitute for milk and eggs]\r\n\r\nExperiments by Dr. Hoobler, Detroit, and at Battle Creek Sanitarium,\r\nprove that nuts “=Possess such superior qualities as supplementary or\r\naccessory food that they are able to replace not only meats, but even\r\neggs and milk=.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Nut Meat The Real Meat\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nuts imported 1917, nearly ten times as great as in 1900]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the period in which the use of nut meat grew\r\nover fifteen times as quickly as the population increased was before the\r\nwar conditions made every man consider food values more carefully. Right\r\nup till 1914, the year in which the war in Europe started, there was a\r\nsteady increase each year in the production of nuts and the importation\r\nof nuts, yet prices kept soaring on all the better varieties because the\r\ngreatly increasing supply failed to keep pace with the increase in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThough the importation of nuts in 1910 had been valued at over thirteen\r\nmillion dollars, and this was nearly four times as great as in 1900—it\r\nkept increasing until in 1917 it amounted to nearly thirty-three million\r\ndollars. The importation of nuts in 1917 was nearly ten times as great\r\nas imports for 1900, yet these imports and the increasing American\r\nproduction failed to meet the demand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecan nut meat a year-round necessity]\r\n\r\nThese figures from U. S. Government reports show that any one who\r\nassumes that nuts are a holiday luxury is entirely wrong. That the\r\npublic wants nut meat the year round, that the only drawback to a still\r\ngreater increase in consumption is the shortage of the supply of fine\r\nnuts is proved by United States Department of Agriculture figures.\r\n\r\nWhen J. C. Cooper wrote in a leading agricultural weekly:\r\n\r\n  “The demand for walnuts is growing much faster than the supply. We\r\n  do not produce in America more than twenty per cent. of what we\r\n  consume, and it will take fifty to a hundred years, with all the\r\n  encouragement of the nut experts, to raise enough walnuts to supply\r\n  the home demand.”\r\n\r\nhe stated a condition which applies with manifold greater force to the\r\nconsumption of pecan nuts.\r\n\r\n  It is true that the California production of Walnuts doubled during\r\n  ten years, while the importation trebled—yet in spite of this\r\n  five-fold production English Walnuts constantly increased in price.\r\n  Since then the price of walnuts has increased steadily every year,\r\n  despite increase of supply until in November, 1918, the price per\r\n  pound was 80% higher than at the same time in 1914, according to the\r\n  Monthly Crop Report for December, 1918. Yet the 1918 crop was nearly\r\n  twice as large as in 1914, according to Statistician H. E. Pastor,\r\n  well known as an authority on western crops.\r\n\r\nThe price of pecans increased 50% on the commonest sorts between 1900\r\nand 1910; and from the December, 1918, Monthly Crop Report we see that\r\nthe 1918 price per pound on all pecans was over 38% higher than for\r\n1917; Georgia, which has the largest percentage of paper shell pecans,\r\nshowing the highest price per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                The Finer The Nut—The Greater The Demand\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increased demand is for finer nuts]\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Walnuts a condition has come about as in other\r\nnuts—that the increasing demand is for the finer, higher priced grades.\r\nWhat are the points of superiority that have led to this great increase\r\nin public demand? Why are old established black walnut trees less\r\nvaluable as profit producers than English Walnut trees only a quarter as\r\nold and producing only a fraction of the quantity of nuts?\r\n\r\n=First=—Thinness of shell and ability to get out the kernels whole.\r\n\r\n=Second=—Superior flavor and food value.\r\n\r\n=Third=—Attractiveness in appearance of the nut and of the nut meat when\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n=Fourth=—Ease of keeping nuts for longer periods and using them readily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paper Shell Pecans meet every demand]\r\n\r\nNow compare the fine Paper Shell Pecan with the English Walnut on every\r\none of these four points of public demand.\r\n\r\nIt is contained in a shell so thin that it is easily broken in the hands\r\nwithout the use of nut crackers. The partitions between the kernels\r\naverage as thin as in the English Walnut, and the average person will,\r\nin less time, remove more whole kernels of the Paper Shell Pecan than of\r\nany other nut.\r\n\r\nAs to flavor and food value let such experts as Luther Burbank answer.\r\n(See Foreword, page 4.) Remember that his answer is certainly unbiased,\r\nfor he is a patriotic native of California where America’s largest crop\r\nof walnuts is produced—and that State produces no quantity of Paper\r\nShell Pecans.\r\n\r\nAs to attractiveness in appearance, of both the nut and the nut meat,\r\nyou and your friends are the best judges. People who know both nuts have\r\nalready handed in their verdict favorable to the paper shell pecan. In\r\naddition, the pecan has been endowed by nature with a shell which is\r\nair-tight—and therefore keeps many times as long without losing its fine\r\nflavor or becoming dry and tough.\r\n\r\n\r\n            “The Most Prized of All Nuts For Domestic Uses”\r\n\r\n  In Bulletin No. 30, of the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.\r\n  C., we read regarding Pecans: “In the course of time, however, as\r\n  they are more widely grown, they will become the most prized of all\r\n  nuts for domestic use, and it is probable that when the supply is\r\n  large they will be preferred abroad to the best Persian nuts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IN OUR ESTABLISHED ORCHARDS stretch row after row of these sturdy,\r\n    strong-trunked, well established pecan trees, which after severe\r\n    pruning are forming immense heads with a profusion of nut bearing\r\n    branches.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Pecan—The Year-round Nut\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Can be raised at best in a forty-mile radius]\r\n\r\n=The pecan is the one nut suitable for eating the year round. And the\r\npresent tendency is toward the year-round use of nuts.=\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the finer pecans are surer to maintain their high\r\nprices than any other nuts is found in the fact that Walnuts of the\r\nfinest grades are being raised in quantities in California, Oregon,\r\nWashington and other States, and in England, France, Italy and South\r\nAmerican countries—while the territory in which the Paper Shell Pecan\r\nattains its highest state of perfection is confined to a 40–mile radius\r\nin southwestern Georgia, embracing those portions of Calhoun, Dougherty,\r\nLee and Mitchell counties, which are nearest Albany.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that the former State Entomologist of Georgia, Mr. E.\r\nLee Worsham, whose name is virtually always included as one of “the\r\nthree big men in his line of endeavor,” wrote: “=In my opinion the pecan\r\ngrowers of South Georgia have the finest horticultural proposition in\r\nthe United States=.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Among the Highest Priced Horticultural Products of America”\r\n\r\n  “Pecans of the second class bring $12,500 a carload. As a result of\r\n  the superior merit of this class of pecans and the limited extent to\r\n  which they are grown, they are now netting the growers in certain\r\n  districts a value per volume of product ranking them among the\r\n  highest priced horticultural products grown on a large scale in this\r\n  country. Carloads weighing 36,000 pounds each were recently (Oct.\r\n  1916) shipped from the Albany district of southwest Georgia to\r\n  Chicago brokers at 35c. a pound or $12,500 a car. These prices were\r\n  for pecans of the second class, the firsts bringing still higher\r\n  prices.” United States Congressional Record, Vol. 54, No. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    “What is The Paper Shell Pecan?”\r\n\r\n\r\nMention Pecan to any one who has tasted the improved paper shell variety\r\nand they will assume that you are talking of Paper Shell Pecans. For the\r\nperson who cracks and eats paper shell pecans feels it almost a\r\nsacrilege to call the common wild pecan a =pecan=.\r\n\r\nYet there are thousands of Americans who have never tasted paper shell\r\npecans, and who think of pecans only as wild pecans, grown largely in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nPecans are divided in three general but radically different classes, as\r\nthe description and cuts below indicate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wild Pecan—a staple food among Indians]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The ordinary wild pecan= is native to America.

Pecan trees in Texas and\r\nLouisiana have been found which were over five hundred to seven hundred\r\nyears old—which were still yielding large crops of nuts.\r\n\r\nLike the oak, no one ever knew a Pecan tree to die of old age.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Southern States wild pecan trees of which the records\r\ngo back to the first civilization on this continent.\r\n\r\nThe pecan tree is so symmetrical and beautiful that it is called “The\r\nQueen Shade Tree of Many a Southern Home.” Its fruitage is so prolific\r\nthat it is said to be “one of the most astonishing food engines in all\r\nnature, yielding literally barrels of nuts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n          “Your Pecan Is Superior To Our Walnut,” Says Burbank\r\n\r\n  In the American Nut Journal, May, 1915, we read: “LUTHER BURBANK is\r\n  credited with the following statement regarding the pecan tree: ‘If\r\n  I were young again I would go South and devote my life to\r\n  propagating new species of the pecan. Walnut culture is the leading\r\n  horticultural product in California, makes more money for us and\r\n  makes it easier than anything else, and your pecan is superior to\r\n  our walnut. _The longevity of the pecan orchard and its immense\r\n  earning power make it one of the most profitable and permanent of\r\n  agricultural investments._’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Hardiest of All Nut Trees\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecan trees fear no drought]\r\n\r\nThe reason for this long life is that the pecan is the hardiest of all\r\nnut trees—free from all ordinary tree pests and diseases because it is\r\nof the hickory group, and the longest lived member of that group. The\r\nlack of surface moisture—the great enemy of most trees—is not a\r\ndisadvantage to the pecan, for it has a remarkably long tap root which\r\ngoes down so deeply into the ground that it draws moisture from the\r\nsub-soil. Since the blooming period is late in Spring, the buds are not\r\ninjured by frost.\r\n\r\nThe wild pecan has been a popular nut, rivaling, because of its superior\r\nflavor, such other nuts as the walnut, chestnut, shellbark, hickory-nut,\r\netc. This popularity was secured despite its many drawbacks—for the\r\nshell of the wild pecan is hard and the partition walls between the\r\nkernels thick and bitter. There was too little meat and too much\r\ndifficulty getting it—but the experts saw in the great demand for\r\npecans, despite these disadvantages, =the promise of rich reward for\r\nimproving the pecan=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seedling superior to wild grown Pecan]\r\n\r\n=The seedling pecan= is the next step toward pecan perfection. Larger\r\nthan the wild pecan, and thinner shelled, it equals or surpasses it in\r\nflavor, depending upon the variety of seedling under consideration.\r\nSelling at an average price of 35 to 45 cents per pound, which is double\r\nthe cost of the wild pecan, it has so much more meat and it is so much\r\nmore accessible, that it is always a better paying purchase for the\r\nhousewife. So justly popular has the seedling pecan become that the wise\r\ndealer and the discriminating housewife will have nothing to do with the\r\ninferior, thick-shelled pecan, which is brightly tinted and polished to\r\ndisguise the inferiority.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Pecan Makes More Progress Than Other Nuts Made In Centuries\r\n\r\n  “With practically no improvement as a result of culture and\r\n  breeding, but taken directly from nature, many of the wild\r\n  pecans afford an exceedingly desirable product. Unconscious,\r\n  and, therefore, unsystematic selection and planting of pecan\r\n  seed about dooryards during a period of less than 200 years has\r\n  developed varieties of such desirable quality that the pecans\r\n  most successfully compete with other species, like the almond\r\n  and the walnut which have been under cultivation for many\r\n  centuries.”—Congressional Record for January, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe Paper Shell Pecan\r\n\r\nHad the work of experts not gone further than establishing the improved\r\nSeedling Pecan, it would have justified all efforts—for the seedling\r\npecan bore justifiable comparison with any other nut on the market in\r\nfood value and accessibility; until =the Paper Shell Pecan was developed\r\nfrom budded trees=.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The paper shell pecan—the queen of all nuts]\r\n\r\nThe Paper Shell Pecan has an air-tight shell so thin that it is easily\r\nbroken in one hand by a gentle pressure. Kernel is large, easily\r\nremoved, of flavor so much finer that any observing person can\r\ndistinguish it from any other pecan by taste alone.\r\n\r\nInstead of a bitter partition wall which imbeds itself in the nut when\r\nit is cracked, as in the wild pecan, the paper shell pecan has a thin,\r\ntissue-like membrane which is easily removed.\r\n\r\nWith the paper shell pecan a larger portion of the total weight of the\r\nnut is meat than with any other nut, with the possible exception of the\r\nfinest almond. And this meat of the paper shell pecan contains seventy\r\nper cent. fat, while that of the almond contains but fifty-four per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe paper shell pecan is the Queen of all nuts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quality unequalled but supply is limited]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has no equal from the standpoint of size, appearance, accessibility\r\nof meat, size of kernel, and fine flavor. The only disadvantage is the\r\nlimited supply—for there is but a small territory in which soil\r\nconditions and climate are right. The walnut is raised in England,\r\nFrance, Italy and in large quantities in the three Pacific coast states,\r\nand in smaller quantities elsewhere. The paper shell pecan seems to\r\nflourish best within a forty-mile radius around Albany, in Southwest\r\nGeorgia. Of the half million budded pecan trees in the world, two\r\nhundred and forty thousand, or practically half, are in this forty-mile\r\nradius. Were complete records of yield accessible, it would be seen that\r\nthis half of the budded trees has produced far more than their portion\r\nof the crop.\r\n\r\n  While State Entomologist of Georgia, Mr. E. L. Worsham, wrote: “The\r\n  Pecan Industry has developed beyond the point where it matters not\r\n  what you or I believe. It is a success. Results are being produced\r\n  of wide interest and of permanent character, and the industry in the\r\n  Albany district in the hands of competent men has wonderful\r\n  potentialities. The hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by\r\n  shrewd business men in Commercial Pecan properties, after personal\r\n  investigation, argues that the development being recorded in the\r\n  Albany district is meritorious.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The First Three Steps In Establishing Paper Shell Pecan Orchards\r\n\r\n\r\n        First, the Seedling Pecan Nut is Planted in the Nursery\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  This picture shows a corner of the Nursery on our Calhoun County\r\n    Plantation, in which thousands of young trees have been grown.\r\n    Selected seedling nuts from our bearing seedling orchard (in the\r\n    background) have but recently sprouted, and are just above ground\r\n    when this first picture is taken.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n              A Few Years Later in the Same Nursery Corner\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  One of our orchard unit owners inspecting the nurseries two years\r\n    later.

They are all you advertised\r\n  them to be. I sent a box on to my daughter in Boston.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Re-orders and the cash—prove superiority]\r\n\r\n  From another, whose husband is at the head of a publication which\r\n  enjoys national prestige as an exponent of the finest nuts and other\r\n  foods by mail order, we received the following letter, along with\r\n  the second order: “Enclosed find check for which send package of\r\n  your Hess Pecans. Kindly ship these at once as we wish them for\r\n  Thanksgiving.”\r\n\r\nWhy take more of your time with detailed copies of letters from\r\ncustomers ordering and re-ordering Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans? Is not\r\nthe fact that re-orders were received in itself the best evidence of\r\nsuperior quality when it is considered that the selling price of many of\r\nthese shipments was $1.25 for 12 ounces, or at the rate of $1.65 per\r\npound?\r\n\r\nThe man whose wife wrote the last letter questioned whether any one\r\nwould pay this price—for an addition of fifty per cent. of the price of\r\nthe average paper shell pecan was too much, in his opinion. He\r\nquestioned the price =before= he sampled the nuts and noticed how much\r\nthey were preferred in his own home and among his friends. =After= that\r\nthe price was forgotten and the recollection of superior quality led him\r\nto re-order, just as it did many others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impossible to supply dealers’ demands]\r\n\r\nFor the past several years we have had to confine our sales almost\r\nentirely to mail orders, because the supply has failed to increase\r\nquickly enough to meet the demand. But in 1914 we made a test in one\r\nAmerican city of only 51,000 population (based on the 1910 census)\r\nthrough one wholesale grocery firm. Paper shell pecans had not been\r\npreviously known in this section, their salesmen said that it was absurd\r\nto attempt to market a 12–oz. box of Hess Brand Pecans at the retail\r\nprice of $1.00, then prevailing. Yet grocers re-ordered and re-ordered\r\ntill our available supply was exhausted—=the demand created by the nuts\r\nthemselves astonished all concerned=.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New York City can consume the world’s supply]\r\n\r\nThe city in which this test was made was not our home town. It does not\r\nstand above the average in per capita wealth—nor is there any evidence\r\nto show that the people of this city are more likely to be interested in\r\npecans than any average American. To make such a test in a large city\r\nlike New York was impossible—for the entire yield of a 100,000–acre\r\nplantation, planted twenty trees to the acre, could not supply a week’s\r\ndemand there, if New York bought pecans in the same proportion as the\r\ncity cited above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                A leading agricultural publication says:\r\n\r\n  “Tyler is a Texas town with about 12,000 people who eat a carload of\r\n  pecans every year. If New York ate pecans at the same rate, it would\r\n  consume our whole crop.” (“Whole crop” refers to all of America’s\r\n  crops combined, which is also the world’s crop.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Why This Phenomenal Demand for Finer Pecans\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for this remarkable demand for the finest grade\r\npecans—despite the higher price—which reasons are briefly indexed on the\r\nfive following pages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The superiority of these finer pecans]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of these reasons is the superior quality of these pecans,\r\nas shown by tests on pages 33 and 34—the fact that they have a greater\r\ncontent of easily digested nut meat, of attractive appearance and\r\ngreatest nutritive value, which nut meat is easily accessible, due to\r\ntheir thin shells.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The movement toward nut meat as the “true meat”]\r\n\r\nThere is a strong movement the world over toward nut meat as the “true\r\nmeat,” in which some have joined for religious reasons, some for ethical\r\nreasons, others from dietetic or hygienic considerations—and many others\r\nbecause of increasing knowledge of food values.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Day Adventists will refer you to the twenty-ninth verse of\r\nthe first chapter of Genesis, which reads:\r\n\r\n  “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,\r\n  which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which\r\n  is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.”\r\n  They reason that according to this passage “true meat” grows on\r\n  trees, and in this belief they are joined by many others for\r\n  ethical, dietetic and hygienic reasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: By religious, ethical and hygienic organizations]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A 3½ YEAR OLD TREE on our plantation, photographed August, 1920.\r\n    October it bore many clusters of large, fully developed pecan nuts.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEverywhere in America there are large numbers of people, organized and\r\nunorganized, who will not eat the flesh of any animal. In sanitaria of\r\nall sorts there is a tendency to reduce to the minimum the use of all\r\nanimal meat or do away with it entirely. In one system of forty\r\nsanitaria there are practically no drugs used because the patients are\r\nput on a perfected diet system in which nuts are substituted for animal\r\nflesh. At Battle Creek Sanitarium alone, under Dr. Kellogg, over 10,000\r\npatients have adopted the meatless diet. Nut meat is largely used there\r\nto replace animal flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Nuts Meet the Demand For Uncooked Foods\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The most perfect uncooked food]\r\n\r\nMany physicians who specialize in diseases of the intestinal tract are\r\nadvising the use of uncooked foods. Dr. Kellogg, in his book, Colon\r\nHygiene, sums up one strong argument in simple, non-technical language\r\nwhen he says on page 223: “=Raw food resists the destructive changes\r\nwhich are produced by bacteria, while cooked food makes no such\r\nresistance.=”\r\n\r\nNut meat is practically the only source of both protein and fat, in\r\nlarge proportions, which it is safe to eat uncooked. This statement is\r\nreadily proved by high authority.\r\n\r\nIn the Congressional Record for January 6, 1917, we read: “Nuts occupy a\r\nunique position in the list of important food products, in that, with\r\nthe possible exception of a few other fruits, in =the raw condition they\r\nalone afford a fairly complete and balanced food for human beings=.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that nut importations in 1917 were nearly ten times as great in\r\nvalue as those in 1900—while the consumption of animal flesh had failed\r\nto even keep pace with the increase in population—is evidence of\r\nincreasing public recognition of the great and varied advantages of nut\r\nmeat over animal flesh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Less butter-fat demanded, more nut-fat]\r\n\r\nPossibly you will find this increase in the consumption of nut meats\r\neven more surprising when you consider that there was practically twenty\r\nper cent. less butter sold from America’s farms in 1909 than in 1899,\r\naccording to U. S. census figures. In other words, the consumption of\r\nbutter, which is the principal table article competing with nuts in\r\nfatty content, was falling off to four-fifths during practically the\r\nsame period while the consumption of nut meat was increasing so rapidly.\r\n\r\nPerfected pecan nuts contain more protein than beefsteak, and almost as\r\nmuch fat as butter. Isn’t it only natural that people should want their\r\nnourishment and fat in this concentrated form—hermetically sealed and\r\nkept pure by nature? Is there any such assurance of purity and\r\ncleanliness on butter—or on beefsteak?\r\n\r\n=Place a Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecan on a hat-pin, light the nut meat\r\nand notice that it burns like a candle because it is seventy per cent.\r\nfat.=\r\n\r\n  “At this age (eight to ten years) the best parts of the orchards\r\n  under the most favorable conditions and in favorable years will not\r\n  infrequently produce from twelve to fifteen pounds per tree. The\r\n  average number of trees per acre of the orchards already planted is\r\n  twenty. Twenty trees per acre, each averaging twelve pounds, yield\r\n  two hundred and forty pounds per acre.” Speech of Congressman Frank\r\n  Park, Jan. 6, 1917, as reported in the Congressional Record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Pecans For Sundaes and Candies, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young women of America, who have changed so largely from soda water\r\nand ice cream to nut sundaes, may not realize that they are getting\r\nincreased nourishment—but that is the case. That this is no small\r\nelement in the consumption of pecans is evidenced by the fact that one\r\ndruggist alone uses 1,500 pounds of crushed pecan meat per year for nut\r\nsundaes—while hundreds might probably use as many if the true figures\r\nwere known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pecan is the concentrated form of nourishment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Enos H. Hess, Second Vice President, and some stockholders of the\r\n    Keystone Pecan Plantation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNut candies are in such great demand that the best confectioners are\r\nastonished. But not all nuts are fit for use in summer. The confectioner\r\nwho is anxious to produce a quality product, places his dependence upon\r\nthe pecan—the finest of nuts—which nature has furnished in an air-tight\r\nshell, which assures satisfaction the year round. The confectioners of\r\nNew Orleans—a hot weather city—long since learned their lesson and that\r\ncity is almost as much noted for its pralines—a pecan nut confection—as\r\nfor its wonderful fete, the Mardi Gras.\r\n\r\nPralines were too good to be confined to New Orleans alone. Along the\r\nboardwalk at Atlantic City and other watering places, and at the finer\r\nconfectionery shops of the larger cities, they are in good demand. There\r\nis no other way to make acceptable pralines except by using pecan\r\nnuts—the finest pralines require that the nuts be whole, which, in turn,\r\nindicates another need for paper shell pecans.\r\n\r\n\r\n         “A Greater Future Than Any Nut Raised In This Country”\r\n\r\n  “It is not many years since these delicious nuts, the Paper Shell\r\n  Pecans, were first introduced to the people of the North, and\r\n  wherever they have gone they have met with instant and cordial\r\n  favor. The Paper Shell Pecan has a greater future than any other nut\r\n  raised in this country. It is a most delicious nut.” Geo. K. Holmes,\r\n  noted authority on agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Maximum Food Values In Condensed Form\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greater digestibility]\r\n\r\nOne remarkable fact about the improved paper shell pecan is that it is\r\nat the same time richer in protein and fat than other nuts, yet is more\r\ndigestible. People who say, “I cannot eat nuts because I suffer from\r\nindigestion,” are surprised to hear of pecans being prescribed by\r\nphysicians—until they try the Paper Shell Pecan themselves and find that\r\nit agrees even with the invalid. Unlike other nuts which contain less\r\nfat—it can be eaten in quantity without salt without any ill effect.\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that the improved pecan contains an oil\r\nwhich seems to possess many of the lubricating and healing qualities\r\nwhich are found in olive oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convenient, condensed nutriment]\r\n\r\nThe digestibility of pecan fat is an established fact—pecans are used\r\nlargely at such scientifically conducted sanitaria as those at Battle\r\nCreek as a substitute for meat and corrective diet in troublesome cases\r\nof intestinal derangement.\r\n\r\nConsider the many fortunes made in olive oil—then remember that even if\r\nscientific research should show that pecan oil is not so beneficial as\r\nolive oil, the pecan has many manifest advantages in its more appetizing\r\nform, assurance of cleanliness and purity, etc., which makes its future\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nNo authority has ever questioned the nutritive value of the pecan. Even\r\nthe wild pecan, which is far inferior in nutritive qualities to the\r\nPaper Shell Pecan, has received high recommendation from eminent\r\nauthorities. But the fact that this nutriment was locked up within a\r\nhard shell, separated by a partition so strong and bitter that it was\r\nseldom possible to get out a satisfactory kernel, kept the wild pecan\r\nfrom enjoying the wide popularity it deserved. The introduction of the\r\nimproved seedling and paper shell varieties not only led to an interest\r\nin these improved varieties, but caused such an increased demand for all\r\npecans that prices rose on even the poorest wild pecans. =But the public\r\nfound that the best pecans are the cheapest in the end—and the demand\r\nfor pecans has increased most rapidly on these grades from which the\r\nlargest kernels, containing the utmost in nutritive value, could most\r\neasily be removed whole.=\r\n\r\n\r\n       From one of the largest nut-tree nurserymen in the world:\r\n\r\n  “The demand for pecans of all descriptions is increasing faster than\r\n  the supply.... The large pecans that we raise bring from 50 cents\r\n  per pound up to $1.25. We do not think that the price will ever drop\r\n  a great deal, though a great income can be had even at 25 cents per\r\n  pound or even lower if trees are ten or more years of age. If one\r\n  had $1,000 to invest he would be satisfied with 7%, which is $70,\r\n  yet five or six trees will bring in this income. There are no\r\n  diseases or insects that are bad on the pecan, nothing like as bad\r\n  as with the apple, peach, etc., nothing that is anywhere near\r\n  ruinous. Pecan trees are naturally a wild tree and therefore very\r\n  hardy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        A Test Which Proves The Best Pecans Cheapest In The End\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A comparison of equal weights of five grades]\r\n\r\nA comparison was made of equal weights of the following grades of\r\npecans:\r\n\r\n=First=, Common wild pecans selling at about 25c per pound.\r\n\r\n=Second=, Common seedling selling at about 30c per pound.\r\n\r\n=Third=, Selected seedling selling at an average price of 40c per pound.\r\n\r\n=Fourth=, Average Paper Shell Pecans, retailing at an average price of\r\nabout 75c per pound.\r\n\r\n=Fifth=, Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans selling at $1.25 per pound.\r\n\r\nThis comparison—on the five points (A-B-C-D-E) detailed below on this\r\npage and on the following page—shows which gives you the most for your\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tested on five counts]\r\n\r\n=A=—=Before Cracking.=—Though size of the nut whole counts for but\r\nlittle in judging pecans, as compared to the quantity and quality of the\r\nmeat within the shell, those making the test were interested to note\r\nthat even in the case of the few paper shell pecans in Class Four which\r\nseemed larger than an average Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecan, these larger\r\nshells were later found to be only partially filled with meat, or with\r\nmany kernels shrivelled.\r\n\r\n=B=—=Opening Process.=—The Hess Brand Paper Shell was found to open more\r\nreadily in the hand without nut crackers, than did the other classes of\r\nnuts when nut crackers were used. When the fragments of shell were\r\ncompared it was easy to see why—superior thinness of shell distinguishes\r\nHess Brand Paper Shell Pecans.\r\n\r\nThe meat in the Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans filled the shells\r\ncompletely, while large air spaces were noted in many varieties in Class\r\nFour.\r\n\r\n=C=—=Separating Meat From Shell.=—When various lots of nuts were\r\ncarefully opened, in separate piles, a careful comparison was made of\r\nthe meat and shells in each pile.\r\n\r\n  “Nature has prepared the soft shell pecan for man’s food by making\r\n  the kernel easier both to extract and to digest,” says a well known\r\n  pecan specialist.\r\n\r\nThe number of whole kernels was counted—no other pecan had four-fifths\r\nas many whole kernels as were found among the Hess Brand Paper Shell\r\nPecans. The common wild pecan and the common seedling had such hard\r\nshells that the meat was practically all broken to small fragments in\r\nopening the shells. No detailed comparison was necessary between these\r\ncrumbs of nut meat, mixed with shell and pith, and the whole kernels or\r\nhalf kernels of the Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans.\r\n\r\n=D=—=The Pith Test.=—In the Hess Brand Paper Shell and in the Paper\r\nShell Pecans of the Fourth Class there was practically no pith—=the\r\ninner partition taking the form of a thin membrane which was easily\r\nremoved, instead of the thick, bitter wall of the two cheaper classes of\r\npecans=.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The most meat per dollar from the highest priced nuts]\r\n\r\n=E=—=The Final Test.=—When the nut meat, which was in appetizing or\r\nedible form, was separated from the shells and partitions in each case,\r\nit was found that for table use =the Hess Brand Paper Shell gave the\r\ngreatest weight of nut meat for every dollar invested in the nuts,\r\ncarriage and opening costs included=. The average paper shell variety\r\nwhich costs nearly as much as the Hess Brand Paper Shell was a poor\r\nsecond, followed closely by the Third Class (the selected seedlings),\r\nwhile the two cheap grades were in the end the most costly\r\ninvestment—because they yielded so small a quantity of satisfactory nut\r\nmeat for each dollar invested.\r\n\r\nThis is also confirmed by many other tests, which show that even\r\nincluding small particles of nut meat, which are far from appetizing in\r\nform, the wild pecan and the common seedling yield less than four pounds\r\nof meat to each ten pounds of nuts; the Selected Seedling Pecan and the\r\ncommon Paper Shell about five pounds of meat to each ten pounds of nuts;\r\nand the Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecan about six and three-quarters pounds\r\nof meat to each ten pounds of nuts.\r\n\r\nWith such superiority proven for Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans, it is no\r\nlonger a question whether the public will pay the higher price. It is\r\npaying it.\r\n\r\n                                         Oskaloosa, Ia., Jan. 8, 1920.\r\n\r\n  The nuts certainly are life size and look good enough to eat. Every\r\n  one who was so fortunate as to get some of the nuts, and they were\r\n  quite a few, pronounced them the finest ever. Here is wishing all\r\n  good things for the pecan company.\r\n\r\n                                                                 R.

As Prof. Hutt,\r\nEx-President of the American Pomological Society, well puts it, “=Once a\r\npecan eater, always a pecan eater.=”\r\n\r\nWherever the improved pecan goes—the world over—it creates its own\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIt is simply marvelous how hungry the world is for these fine pecans,\r\nand it will be hungry for many years to come because the increase in\r\nsupply does not keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand for high\r\nquality pecans. The obvious remedy, therefore, is to produce more fine\r\npecans by planting more pecan orchards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Small branches showing how pecan nuts grow.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        How Pecan Trees Do Grow\r\n\r\n\r\non our plantations in South Georgia once their wonderful root system is\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: June 1919 ↢ SAME TREE ↣ July 7, 1920]\r\n\r\n Above—C.

During this period before bearing begins, the greatest\r\ncare and attention are necessary—once the pecan orchard is well\r\nestablished, the trees are hardy as an oak.[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  In the proceedings of the National Nut Growers Association we read of\r\n  many pecan trees which have remarkable records for long life and great\r\n  yields. It tells of one tree, now 110 years old, which has borne every\r\n  year for thirty years, bearing 400 pounds of nuts in a single season.\r\n  Another is now 75 years old and has borne every year for forty-one\r\n  years—largest annual crop being 800 pounds, average crop over 500\r\n  pounds per season for thirty years past. Another property has borne as\r\n  high as 900 pounds per year and has borne every year for forty-one\r\n  years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trained specialists and our exceptional equipment on your\r\n           units]\r\n\r\nOur co-operative, profit-sharing plan gives your pecan orchard the\r\nbenefit of the skill and experience of our trained horticulturists, and\r\nof mechanical facilities which it would be impossible for the average\r\npecan orchardist to possess.\r\n\r\nOur pecan orchard plantations, totaling over 7,300 acres, are all\r\nlocated near Albany, Georgia, the “hub of the pecan universe.” The land\r\nhas been approved by experts of highest standing as possessing the rare\r\ncharacter of soil necessary.\r\n\r\nCorroborating these opinions is the fact that we have right on our\r\nproperty many pecan trees, bearing seedling nuts in large quantities,\r\ndespite the fact that they were planted thirty trees to the acre fifteen\r\nand twenty years ago. Now only twenty Paper Shell Pecan trees are being\r\nplanted to the acre, because of their vigorous growth. These trees will\r\nundoubtedly increase in size and in annual yield every year till they\r\nare forty years old—and bear their maximum crop for a century or more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Twenty Paper Shell Pecan trees of standard varieties on each\r\n           acre-unit]\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Pecan Company was organized and incorporated for the\r\npurpose of planting its property with Paper Shell Pecans on a\r\nco-operative and profit-sharing basis.

From the beginning the company has been\r\nplanting the property to Paper Shell Pecans of standard varieties,\r\ntwenty trees to each acre-unit. It cultivates and cares for the trees\r\nand the land for a period of five years from planting of orchard units,\r\nand the charge per acre-unit includes land, clearing, furnishing trees,\r\nplanting, cultivating, care, etc. After this period the company shares\r\nwith the unit holder in the profits from the nuts as explained on page\r\n38.

All this is done\r\nwithout expense to the buyer. The total net proceeds from any nuts grown\r\nduring this development period, will be paid to the Orchard Unit Owner\r\nafter deducting 12½ per cent. commission for gathering and marketing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crops marketed for you]\r\n\r\nAfter the five-year development period the Company will, at the option\r\nof the unit owner, enter into an agreement to operate the property as\r\nagent for the unit owner on the most profitable basis, for such period\r\nof time as shall be mutually agreed upon, fertilizing and farming the\r\nland, cultivating and pruning the trees, as well as gathering and\r\nmarketing the pecans, receiving, after the necessary expenses are\r\ndeducted, 12½% of the profits, 87½% being paid to the Orchard Unit\r\nOwner. Under the co-operative profit-sharing agreement and plans as\r\noutlined there should be enormous profits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sold on easy monthly payments]\r\n\r\nAs the expense of developing is distributed over a number of years, the\r\ncompany has arranged to sell the orchard units on small monthly\r\npayments, thus placing a golden opportunity within the reach of all\r\ninvestors and giving them a chance to make their money work as\r\neffectively for them as if they themselves were operating on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: You own the land]\r\n\r\nRemember, you become absolute owner of the acre of land in your orchard\r\nunit. The land is cleared, the pecan trees are planted, cultivated and\r\ncared for as a whole on a large scale. This is co-operation under a\r\nsystem which relieves you of every worry and which makes for economy and\r\nlarge profits.\r\n\r\n  “The pecan industry is a husky infant with almost boundless\r\n  possibilities. We are building an industry, which, for generations,\r\n  should yield its bountiful crop of delicious food and bring millions\r\n  of dollars to our citizens.” Congressional Record of United States,\r\n  page 1478, Vol. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Practical Answer—The Unit Plan\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expert supervision at lower cost than hired help by our plan]\r\n\r\nThere are many people who know of the great successes made in pecan\r\ngrowing in this district, who would be glad to buy five, ten or twenty\r\nacres of our Pecan Orchard Plantation. The land in itself would\r\nundoubtedly be a good investment, because cases are on record showing\r\nincrease of double and treble value on land which does not have an\r\norchard. But this would not be of any great advantage in solving the\r\nproblem of supplying more of the finest pecans unless the purchaser had\r\nthe knowledge, skill and time to bring his trees to the bearing point.\r\n\r\nEven assuming that he could himself bring the trees to bearing, his\r\nability to market his product advantageously could not possibly equal\r\nthat of a co-operative group of orchardists, who have the most skilled\r\nsupervision service and the advantages regarding marketing which come\r\nfrom collective effort.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Co-operative marketing assures higher profits]\r\n\r\nWith several carloads to ship instead of a few barrels, the large\r\norchardist is in a position to command the very lowest rate and to reach\r\nthe market in just the right season.\r\n\r\nAsk any member of a Citrus Fruit Exchange whether he has made more money\r\nsince he joined that organization than he did before, and he will tell\r\nyou an interesting story which cannot fail to convince you of the\r\nadvantage of collective marketing. Yet oranges and grape fruit, the\r\nproducts of the members of these exchanges, are perishable in such a\r\nshort time that the benefits derived are small compared with those\r\ngained by co-operative marketing of Paper Shell Pecans.\r\n\r\nThere are other advantages of collective effort which exceed even the\r\nadvantages in marketing. Among them is the advantage of skilled\r\nsupervision at minimum cost. The professional or business man can live\r\nin the North, enjoying the income which his specialized efforts assure,\r\nyet be growing his pecan orchard in the South under the supervision of\r\nexpert pecan horticulturists whom he could not possibly afford to retain\r\nfor a plantation of less than a thousand acres and with labor costs\r\nreduced to a minimum by such skillful management and the use of the most\r\nmodern mechanical appliances such as tractors, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Live at home raise pecans in Georgia]\r\n\r\nHe need not lose an hour from his regular business to supervise the\r\ngathering and marketing of his crop of pecans. While he makes money at\r\nhis own business, his orchard unit also makes money for him without\r\nsacrificing his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Our Pecan Orchard Plantations Are Divided Into One-Acre Units\r\n\r\n\r\nEach twenty-tree unit is platted off on the plan of our property and\r\nindicated with an Orchard Unit number.\r\n\r\nIn each of these units twenty pecan trees are planted.\r\n\r\n=The purchaser of an Orchard Unit secures absolute ownership of his\r\nland=, but each entire plantation is operated as a whole. This plan has\r\nmade it possible for us to clear the land, plant, cultivate and care for\r\nthe young trees at a fraction of the cost which would be necessary if\r\nthe units were operated separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustration at left: Upper picture shows James J. Best, Canton, Ohio,\r\n    photographed June, 1918, at one of the newly planted trees on his 21\r\n    acre-units. Picture below shows same tree two years later. Great\r\n    growth of head and thickening of trunk result from our intensive\r\n    cultivation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cost of land, cost of clearing and cost of setting trees, etc., is\r\nof such magnitude as to be almost prohibitive to any person developing a\r\nsmall acreage. Under the Orchard Unit Plan this cost is reduced owing to\r\nthe scope of the undertaking. It is generally conceded that when you\r\ndevelop orchards in large tracts of 1,000 acres each or more, the cost\r\nof machinery, equipment, live stock, management and other\r\nessentials—distributed over the whole area—is therefore far lower per\r\nacre than when you develop a limited area, such as five, ten or even\r\nfifty acres. A small orchard managed on a small scale cannot produce\r\npecans nearly as economically as if that small orchard is a Unit under\r\nlarge plantation management.\r\n\r\nThe company gains also by the natural increase in value of the 2,000\r\nacres of fertile pecan growing land which it is holding for itself under\r\nthe same conditions which apply to any unit in the 5,400 being sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                SERVICE Which Build Productive Orchards\r\n\r\n\r\nIntensive cultivation by Mechanical Power—Mule Power—Man Power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Two of our six tractors at work on one of the 51 acre-units owned by\r\n    Mrs. C. J. Balliet, Lehighton, Pa., pulling Roderick-Lean 24 disk\r\n    harrows. Note also on page 43 the mule drawn plows.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Pecan Co. has set as its goal the production of pecan\r\norchards second to none. To achieve this, all work is planned many\r\nmonths ahead of operations, every detail carefully considered and\r\nspecifications drawn which cover every phase of the work from the\r\nplanning of the tree rows, the planting of the young, dormant, budded,\r\npaper shell pecan trees, to the care and cultivation of these trees\r\nthroughout the entire development period. These specifications cover the\r\nselection of trees of the standard varieties, the size and quality of\r\nthe trees, the methods by which they are dug in the nursery, the size of\r\nthe hole in which they are planted and the methods of planting; with\r\nespecial attention to the character of the soil placed in the tree holes\r\nand the methods of replacing the same. The proper system of fertilizing\r\nwhen planting and at each subsequent stage is carefully outlined and all\r\nother work is done under the supervision of skilled experts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hoe hands augment the tractor and mule cultivation by hoeing around\r\n    every tree on the plantation at approximate 10–day intervals during\r\n    the growing season.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cultivation at the various periods of the year and the various\r\nstages of growth is provided for and carried out with utmost care. The\r\nKeystone horticulturists insist upon intensive cultivation using\r\nmechanical, mule and man power, each in its separate sphere to complete\r\ntheir carefully planned system. The use of powerful tractors for plowing\r\nand harrowing with 24–disk Roderick-Lean harrows has produced results\r\nwhich would otherwise be unattainable. Throughout the growing season a\r\nthorough harrowing at ten-day intervals conserves the moisture, destroys\r\nnoxious vegetation and so improves the condition of the soil that its\r\nsturdy, vigorous growth continues.\r\n\r\nAt certain stages tractor cultivation is augmented by mule drawn plows\r\nwhich in alternate plowings turn the soil to and from the trees. These\r\nare followed by Planet, Jr. Cultivators.\r\n\r\nThis work is further augmented by hoeing squads working under thorough\r\nsupervision (see cut at right). The result of this intensive cultivation\r\nis growth—quick growth—substantial growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            One of the Safest Industries—The Profit is O. K.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. J. Cooper, President of the First National Bank of Waycross, Georgia,\r\nclearly states the whole proposition, when he says: “The pecan industry\r\nis in its infancy, but is being developed very rapidly in this immediate\r\nsection. It is considered one of the safest industries in South Georgia,\r\nand the profit is O. K. once you get the trees in good bearing\r\ncondition.”\r\n\r\nFar-sighted business people are investing in pecan orchards because\r\ntheir investigation proves that the bearing pecan orchard is “=one of\r\nthe most profitable and permanent of agricultural investments=.” See\r\nstatement of Luther Burbank, the Edison of Agriculture on page 19.\r\n\r\n=Below is a table showing a conservative estimate of the probable yield\r\nof an acre orchard unit in this district.

There is now a\r\n  greater demand for all kinds of nuts than ever before, a demand that\r\n  our growers will not be able to catch up with for years. The pecan\r\n  is undoubtedly the finest, most nutritious and most delicious of\r\n  nuts. The world must get her supplies of pecans from us (in the\r\n  southern section of the United States) and as yet we do not begin to\r\n  supply the local demands, to say nothing of producing for export.”\r\n\r\nW. N. Hutt, Ex-President, American Pomological Society, Ex-President,\r\nNational Nut Growers Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Our Figures are Intentionally Conservative\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years the selling price of pecans at the orchard has been more\r\nthan double the price used in our table. No one can tell how much higher\r\npecan prices may go. On Patrician Pecans—introduced by us in the 1920\r\nseason—we have found an exceedingly large demand at $1.50 for a 12–oz.\r\nbox, which is at the rate of $2.00 a pound, and have received many\r\nstrong commendations from purchasers. These de luxe pecans have been\r\nsold into all sections of the United States—including such southern\r\nstates as Mississippi, Florida, Texas, etc.—and into Canada, Alaska,\r\nFrance and other foreign countries; not in the 12–oz. package only, but\r\nalso in 10–lb. cartons and barrel lots.\r\n\r\nWe are intentionally conservative. We want the investor in our\r\ntwenty-tree orchard units to be agreeably surprised that the yield is\r\ngreater and the price secured per pound higher than our table shows.\r\n=Our interests and those of the investor are identical—selling an\r\norchard at the low price shown on the application blank (page 71)\r\nbenefits us little unless the return secured from the gathering and sale\r\nof nuts is satisfactory.=\r\n\r\n“For the person who is willing to wait a few years there is no more\r\nprofitable investment than a grove of pecans,” says J. B. Wight, Pecan\r\nNurseryman and Grove Owner.\r\n\r\nUnder our co-operative plan the investment is reduced to the minimum\r\nduring the waiting years. As shown by application blank at rear of this\r\nbook we offer an acre-unit planted with twenty pecan trees of standard\r\nvarieties on an easy deferred payment plan.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you put down your first payment, the contract of sale\r\nprotects you—in the opportunity to reap profits from the constantly\r\nincreasing yields of pecans when the trees begin to bear, and in the\r\nopportunity to gain by the $100 a year increase in value of your\r\nacre-unit. For the most authentic information shows that each acre pecan\r\norchard unit increases in value each year at the rate of at least $100.\r\n\r\n=Figure it out for yourself=—carefully and conservatively. Though the\r\nprice now being secured for the nuts is far higher than the price used\r\nin the table on page 42, we would rather that you base your comparisons\r\non the figures in that conservative table. The case is strong enough on\r\nthat basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n             An Increase in Value of $100 per Year per Acre\r\n\r\n  Mr. E. B. Adams, formerly Secretary of the Albany, Ga., Chamber of\r\n  Commerce, writes: “Each season the pecan groves enhance in value, it\r\n  being agreed by eminent pecan authorities that properly cared for\r\n  pecan groves increase $100 an acre in value each year.”\r\n\r\n  This is an investment where your principal increases and your income\r\n  gets larger as the years roll by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Why Do We Sell Orchard Units?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can answer that in a few words.\r\n\r\nTo raise money to establish more pecan orchards.\r\n\r\nWe must have more finest grade paper shell pecans to meet the increasing\r\ndemand. America demands more. When this market is supplied—which date\r\nseems generations distant—there are limitless opportunities open for\r\nexport business.\r\n\r\nThe pecan is a food in demand all year around, yet the constantly\r\nincreasing supply is exhausted in a few months.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary increase of plantings would meet the need. Our Co-operative\r\nProfit-Sharing Plan is the most direct, most effective solution of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is enormous. To make right use of that opportunity\r\nrequires large planning and large plantings. We have now four thousand\r\nacres of pecan trees planted and growing on our plantations—to establish\r\nthese, fertilize, cultivate and care for them until bearing would\r\ninvolve an outlay so prodigious that it is good policy for our company\r\nto welcome the co-operation of a limited number of unit owners, assuring\r\nmaximum efficiency on all our acreage at a minimum expense for planting,\r\ncare, cultivation, gathering crop, marketing nuts, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  In one of our 3½ year old orchards, showing sturdy trunks and heavy\r\n    heads.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Our Investors Are Found All Over The World\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A 3½ YEAR OLD TREE on our plantation.

I am happy to say that my orchards\r\n  were fully as good as reported—the thrifty, strong-trunked,\r\n  heavy-headed trees are in many respects better than I expected.\r\n\r\n  Your Medium Height Pruning System has produced wonderful trees. They\r\n  are developing thick, strong trunks and branches, and large,\r\n  symmetrical heavy heads. Your thorough cultivation, with tractors,\r\n  mules, and hoeing around the trees by hand, on every part of the\r\n  plantation, keeps the soil in the best possible condition to promote\r\n  growth.\r\n\r\n  The growth already made shows that your methods produce unusual\r\n  results.\r\n\r\n  The foundation idea underlying all your plans seems to be service,\r\n  and as a manufacturer of many years experience selling to many of\r\n  the largest concerns in this and other countries, I have learned\r\n  that service and the application of the Golden Rule are the\r\n  foundation of all success. All businesses and all persons are\r\n  measured by the service they render.\r\n\r\n  My visit to your plantations has shown me that your Company places\r\n  service always foremost, and that you stand for a square deal. In\r\n  cultivation and pruning and in every way the trees are treated as\r\n  individuals and each tree receives individual attention. When the\r\n  thirty-five hundred acres now planted will have passed through the\r\n  development years, the Keystone Pecan Groves will be a place of\r\n  beauty and will be a perennial source of profit to the owners of the\r\n  units.\r\n\r\n  I have also visited your offices at Manheim on various occasions,\r\n  and have found the equipment and organization there fully as\r\n  complete and as efficient as that on the plantations. I have met\r\n  several of the directors of the company, all of whom stand high in\r\n  their communities, and are known as men of honor and ability. Mr.\r\n  Elam G. Hess, the president of the Company, I have found to be a man\r\n  of integrity and uprightness in his dealings, who has demonstrated\r\n  exceptional ability in building up an organization which renders\r\n  expert and conscientious service to the unit owners.\r\n\r\n  In my travels I have investigated the pecan market and its possible\r\n  future. I have tried to buy Paper Shell Pecans in the different\r\n  cities from Kansas City and Minneapolis, East as far as Boston, but\r\n  find it is possible to get them during only a few months of the\r\n  year. The orchards now planted will be able to supply only a small\r\n  fraction of the demand already existing for these pecans, and with\r\n  your marketing facilities reaching to all parts of the civilized\r\n  world, the opportunities in this field are unlimited.\r\n\r\n                           Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                      HENRY E.

Long as this trip is, what\r\n  I saw there well repaid me for the effort.\r\n\r\n  Throughout this district (around Albany) I made inquiry regarding\r\n  the Keystone Pecan Orchards and heard that your orchards were noted\r\n  not only for their large size but also for the extra care and\r\n  cultivation given the trees. The advantage of these high scientific\r\n  standards and thorough supervision are apparent all over the\r\n  property. I was pleased to see over a hundred thousand pounds of\r\n  ground bone meal being put around the trees to fertilize them. It is\r\n  such extra effort that leads to biggest results.\r\n\r\n                                A. E. Pretty, Dawson, Yukon Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Our Interests Are in Safe Hands,” Says Rev. George W. Lutz, Unit Owner.\r\n\r\n                                        Pennsburg, Pa., June 26, 1919.\r\n\r\n  Your plantation is large—very large. The soil is real pecan soil.\r\n  When I saw thousands upon thousands of pecan trees—budded and large\r\n  bearing trees—in the same kind of soil, on all sides, I no longer\r\n  asked myself the question whether my units were of soil on which the\r\n  pecan would grow into a productive and profitable orchard. When I\r\n  saw the kind of trees you planted—thick-stemmed and healthy trees,\r\n  and the splendid care given them as regards cultivation and\r\n  scientific pruning, I was still better satisfied.\r\n\r\n  But I am convinced, now that I saw it all, that soil, climate,\r\n  moisture and virile trees, necessary as these are, they are not the\r\n  whole thing in producing a thrifty pecan orchard. These factors\r\n  mixed with brains grow the pecan. I congratulate your company, first\r\n  of all, upon the fact that you have a real executive in your\r\n  energetic President. Mr. Elam G. Hess. It is this master mind that\r\n  has planned so wisely and soundly for the future. Every unit holder\r\n  with whom I have talked has the fullest confidence in his integrity\r\n  and ability. In my opinion, therefore, the affairs of your company\r\n  and the interests of the unit owners are absolutely safe in his\r\n  hands.\r\n\r\n  Finally, permit me to congratulate you upon your and our good\r\n  fortune in securing the services of Mr. William P. Bullard as\r\n  Horticulturist. Mr. Bullard is without a doubt the best-posted pecan\r\n  man in the country today. He is not a theorist but very practical. A\r\n  visit to his well-kept bearing orchard and nurseries was a most\r\n  delightful one. I am absolutely confident that what Mr. Bullard has\r\n  already done in his own orchard he can accomplish for you and all\r\n  unit owners—grow a productive and profitable pecan orchard in the\r\n  shortest possible time.\r\n\r\n                                                  (Rev.)

Your work in preparation\r\n  and planting had been most thoroughly done, and the remarkably\r\n  thrifty condition of the trees shows that they have established good\r\n  root systems. The wonderful progress made by your trees shows the\r\n  advantage of your thorough cultivation and scientific pruning. This\r\n  should mean bigger yields—and bigger profits.\r\n\r\n  I am well pleased with all I have seen. Please let me know by return\r\n  mail whether you can give me the entire block on which my units are\r\n  located for our own immediate family.\r\n\r\n                                                      A.

The growth made by them shows that your\r\n  methods are right, and I know that your thorough care in cultivation\r\n  and fertilizing brings about even greater progress for the future.\r\n  Your methods of pruning my older trees have produced exceptionally\r\n  sturdy trunks, and heads which show a three-fold increase of nut\r\n  bearing branches.\r\n\r\n  I am perfectly satisfied with the progress you are making and the\r\n  fact that I have just bought ten additional units is proof that I\r\n  consider the investment a good one.\r\n\r\n                                                      Frank R. Ritter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         An Ideal Southern Home\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically every thoughtful man looks forward to the time when he may\r\nhave a home where the winter rigors of the Northern climate shall not\r\nsap his vitality. No one need apologize for this longing—or consider it\r\na sign of lack of vigor or backbone.\r\n\r\nFor the tendency toward establishing a home in the South is not based\r\nalone on this desire for an agreeable, equable climate. It is founded on\r\nsound economic principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Where Winter Does Not Consume What the Summer Produces\r\n\r\nIn the North, the winter consumes the food which the summer produces. In\r\nthe fertile sections of Southern Georgia a succession of crops, properly\r\nplanned, makes the whole year productive.\r\n\r\nVegetation is so rapid that in a few years a home is surrounded by a\r\ngrowth of trees, shrubbery and growing crops.\r\n\r\nGovernment statistics show a surprisingly slight variation between\r\nWinter and Summer in Southern Georgia. Here there is no enervating\r\nhumidity compared to that found in the Northern and Central Atlantic\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The home of our Assistant Horticulturist—shaded by the big bearing\r\n    pecan trees.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere is the ideal home—“Where the sun shines bright and the meadow’s in\r\nbloom”—where good fishing and hunting abound—where the call of the “Bob\r\nWhite” is heard from September to March—where the outdoor life is the\r\nnatural, healthful life the year round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A plantation house of the Keystone Pecan Company on its Calhoun County\r\n    Orchard Plantation. From left to right: Elam G. Hess, President of\r\n    the Company; M. G. Esbenshade, Secretary and Treasurer; and Thos. F.\r\n    Miller, Sales Manager.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere, with the fine southern town of Albany only a short distance away,\r\nwith fine roads extending roundabout in all directions, you may live on\r\na typical plantation. While Nature, soil and sun combine to produce\r\nprofitable crops on the pecan trees which have been turned over to you a\r\nthrifty orchard, you may fish, boat or swim on the beautiful Lake\r\nMarcelia—a twenty-five acre lake right on your plantation.\r\n\r\nWe expect eventually to erect a club house or hotel on the banks of the\r\nlake, where unit owners may be accommodated should they wish to spend\r\ntheir vacation here hunting and fishing.\r\n\r\nWhen you live amid such surroundings you really live. The country all\r\nabout is so attractive that many a man in the North would be glad to pay\r\n$650 or $750 for an acre on which to build a southern home. If he\r\nplanted on that acre only enough pecan trees to yield an average income\r\nof $45 per year, he would have six per cent. interest from his money.\r\nOne tree should yield more than $30 per year, on an average, from the\r\ntenth to the twentieth year from planting. Why be satisfied with a\r\nsingle tree when there is room for twenty trees and a small bungalow on\r\nyour acre?\r\n\r\n\r\n       Office of the Clerk, District Court, Boulder County, Col.\r\n\r\n                                     Boulder, Colorado, June 26, 1919.\r\n\r\n  I have lived many years in Colorado and have been in close contact\r\n  with the agricultural development of the west. I have long believed\r\n  that Walnut growing in California was one big opportunity. During\r\n  the past two weeks I have visited your plantation in Georgia and\r\n  have travelled over it from end to end. Since that visit I am more\r\n  thoroughly convinced than ever that you have the finest nut growing\r\n  proposition in this country.\r\n\r\n  The wonderful way in which I found the trees growing on the ten\r\n  orchard units which I had previously bought has led me to purchase\r\n  more units, and I expect to buy still more later.\r\n\r\n  You have the soil, the climate and the organization to produce\r\n  successful pecan groves.\r\n\r\n                                                      Fred. W. Burger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Investigate The Company And Its Management\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the most conservative statement of yield from our pecan units\r\nsounds too good to be true, we have found that it was necessary to urge\r\nprospective purchasers to investigate every phase of the company.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the men who have invested most largely are always the\r\nmen most capable of getting at the real facts—and acting on their own\r\nknowledge—manufacturers, merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians,\r\ndentists, salesmen, accountants, teachers, preachers, farmers and others\r\nof the most intelligent classes are becoming owners of orchard units\r\nbecause their investigation has shown:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why your investment is secure]\r\n\r\n=First.= That the Company is financially strong—a $215,000 corporation,\r\nwhich received its charter in 1911 from the Superior Court of Georgia.\r\nSubsequent to the incorporation, the Company purchased what its officers\r\nbelieved to be the finest plantation in Calhoun County for the growth\r\nand development of Paper Shell Pecans. The plantation with recent\r\nadditions, all located around Albany, Georgia, totals nearly 7,400 acres\r\nof land, which has been or is to be planted to pecans. From the date of\r\nthe purchase the Company has expended large sums of money annually upon\r\nthe development of the property and each passing year sees a greater\r\nexpenditure upon property development and permanent property\r\nimprovement. Latest approved methods are sought and applied; and\r\nnotwithstanding all this the Calhoun County Plantation is subject to a\r\nlien of only twenty-seven thousand dollars, the Dougherty County\r\nPlantation to only five thousand dollars, the Mitchell County Property\r\nto only ten thousand dollars. For the purpose of safeguarding the unit\r\nowners a special trustee was appointed whose duty it is to see that the\r\ncompany’s receipts from orchard sales are appropriated to the\r\ndevelopment of the orchards sold, the planting of new orchards and the\r\nreduction of the lien until the same shall have been extinguished\r\nentirely. This result will be achieved before the Company shall have\r\nconveyed one-half of its orchards—a unique record among modern business\r\nconcerns. The Trustee plan was specially devised for the protection of\r\nUnit buyers, and we know of no Company that has devised a safer plan. It\r\nis the result of the most careful consideration given in the interest of\r\nthe unit buyer. When you are safe, we are safe also.\r\n\r\nThe books of the Keystone Pecan Co. are audited quarterly by Certified\r\nPublic Accountants, Vollum, Fernley & Vollum, of Philadelphia, New York\r\nand Chicago.\r\n\r\n=Second. That the orchards are under capable supervision.= The active\r\nofficers of the Company were close students of pecan growing for years\r\nprevious to 1911.\r\n\r\nRealizing the fact that the making of profits depends in part on the\r\nskill of the orchardist, the Company has employed educated, practical\r\nhorticulturists who have large pecan groves of their own, where they\r\nearned reputations as orchardists that secured them highest\r\nrecommendations of well known authorities. The fact that such men\r\naccepted positions with the Keystone Pecan Company is a tribute to the\r\npossibilities of these plantations.\r\n\r\nFor resident plantation managers they chose pecan men of excellent\r\nreputation, who had demonstrated exceptional ability in handling the\r\nproblem in all its phases.\r\n\r\n=Third. That the Company has the character of soil, the kind of budded\r\ntrees, and the shipping facilities needed to fill the demand for better\r\ngrade pecans which comes from all over America and abroad.= The\r\nimmediate district in which our plantations are located is the natural\r\nhome of the pecan. We have an excellent warehouse site on the Central of\r\nGeorgia Railroad, at Bermuda Station, a passenger station and warehouse\r\non the Dougherty County Plantation, and all portions of our plantations\r\nare favorably located for shipping.\r\n\r\n=Fourth.= The Company has demonstrated also that its management is\r\ncapable and efficient. Every one is interested heartily in the success\r\nof the orchards. All are men of unquestioned honor and ability; as\r\ninquiry in their home cities will prove. They are, as the following\r\npages show, men old enough and experienced enough to capably manage the\r\nbusiness, yet young enough to retain their business capacity and vigor\r\nfor many years to come.\r\n\r\n=Fifth.= That a marketing organization has been developed which has\r\nsuccessfully sold paper shell pecans all over the world, and that the\r\ndemand for these superior pecans far exceeds the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n                “The Supply Will Never Equal The Demand”\r\n\r\n  _From the former President of the Albany, Ga., Chamber of Commerce_,\r\n  J. A. Davis, we hear: “The strongest evidence of my belief in the\r\n  future of this wonderful development is that I have just planted a\r\n  grove of one hundred acres. I know of no agricultural or\r\n  horticultural industry which, with proper attention, holds promise\r\n  of returns half so large as the pecan in Southwest Georgia. Both our\r\n  soil and our climate are peculiarly adapted for the production of\r\n  the finest nuts in most abundant yield. These nuts are the size and\r\n  quality which make them absolutely the finest nut on the market.\r\n  They will always command a fancy price because the supply will never\r\n  equal the demand.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ELAM G.

After serving\r\nin this capacity for two years, he was sent to England to represent the\r\nsame company.\r\n\r\nIn his travels he was impressed with the opportunities which existed for\r\nfiner grade pecan nuts, and began to make an exhaustive study of their\r\nproduction and their selling possibilities—one result of which has been\r\nthe formation of the Keystone Pecan Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Hess devotes his entire time to the success of the Company, and is\r\nan acknowledged authority on pecan nuts, their growth and their\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nReference: Keystone National Bank, Manheim, Pa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  L.

The trees in\r\n  Block 1 A, for instance, prove the advantages of the Keystone Medium\r\n  Height Pruning System. In many cases they have made five to six feet\r\n  growth since they were pruned last Spring—and the thickening of the\r\n  trunks and all the branches proves that those trees will be well\r\n  able to carry heavy heads and bear large crops of pecans.\r\n\r\n  In the old bearing orchard the foliage was of the same healthy deep\r\n  green color noted all over the plantation. But the best proof of\r\n  their vigor was the fact that on many of these trees all the\r\n  branches were loaded down with big nuts, nearly ripe.\r\n\r\n  After a lifetime contact with growing things, I am so well pleased\r\n  with the conditions on the plantation that I have, as you know,\r\n  purchased additional units.\r\n\r\n                                                     L. B. CODDINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why Mr. Miller, Our Sales Manager, Bought Seven Additional Units\r\n\r\n                       968 Jackson St., Allentown, Pa., Dec. 29, 1919.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Mr. Hess_:\r\n\r\n  In May, 1915, I wrote you that my interest in this new industry and\r\n  my ambition to some day own a pecan orchard dates back before the\r\n  Keystone Pecan Co. was in existence. My study of this improved nut,\r\n  its food value, the whole world to supply, its advantage over other\r\n  tree crops, in harvesting, packing, shipping, not perishable, beside\r\n  the long life of the trees and the small expense of up-keep after\r\n  the fifth year, and the wonderful yield satisfied me that it was the\r\n  safest and most profitable industry I know.\r\n\r\n  When you conceived and formed the Keystone Pecan Company with its\r\n  co-operative plan, I saw my opportunity, and invested and purchased\r\n  Units. Having been in business with you for so many years and\r\n  knowing your capacity to plan big business and your ability to carry\r\n  your plans to perfection, also the other members of the Company\r\n  being known as clean, honest and progressive business men, gave me\r\n  entire confidence. When you wanted me to become sales manager, I\r\n  decided to visit the plantation. In company with some of my friends,\r\n  I made my first visit. We were delighted, beyond expression, with\r\n  everything. Competent management seemed to be working out a perfect\r\n  system.\r\n\r\n  Now, after nearly five years of continual work with you in selling\r\n  the Keystone Pecan Orchard units, I want to compliment you more\r\n  strongly than ever on the way you have planned and are making good.\r\n  The progress has been beyond our most sanguine expectations. Each\r\n  year I have visited the plantation from one to three times\r\n  accompanied in every case by Unit Owners. My friends have always\r\n  been well pleased with what they saw on their orchards, but the\r\n  marked progress the past year, under your expert plantation\r\n  organization, is such as to fire every Unit Owner with the desire to\r\n  own more units, fertilized, pruned, cultivated and cared for under\r\n  your system.\r\n\r\n  A total of over 200 additional units have been purchased during the\r\n  past year by unit owners who have visited the plantation with me.\r\n  Many of these purchased their first units two, three, or four years\r\n  ago, before visiting the orchards. This is the strongest evidence\r\n  that the conditions on the plantation must be right. I was glad I\r\n  could add seven more units to my own number during the past year,\r\n  and hope to further increase my holdings. I can see now why Mr.\r\n  William P. Bullard, your horticulturist, expressed surprise that the\r\n  Company was selling these units at so low a figure.\r\n\r\n                                                      THOS. F. MILLER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WM. P.

Let your own judgment decide. Ask yourself these\r\nquestions in regard to any investment under consideration.\r\n\r\n=What is the security back of my investment?= In the Keystone Pecan Co.\r\nthere is an acre of land which becomes yours on the payment of price\r\nshown on page 71. Remember this—you own the acre of land itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Productive land—yielding needed food of highest value]\r\n\r\n=Land is the safeguard of this safe investment.= Land cannot burn up,\r\ncannot be stolen; land cannot be wiped out by panics. The biggest trusts\r\nbase their bond issues and their mortgages on land—yet the manufacturing\r\nplants which are built on that land may, due to panic, fail to produce\r\nenough to pay interest on the bonds or mortgages. Many of the largest\r\nindustrial companies have suspended or decreased dividends since the\r\nEuropean War ended, =yet nature continues to provide foodstuffs and man\r\nstill needs to eat them=.\r\n\r\n=Productive land is the best of land investments.= Tree crops are the\r\nprofitable crops, which make land most productive. Note on page 37 that\r\na leading farm paper tells of single pecan trees making more human food\r\nthan a whole acre of Kentucky blue grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A 3½ YEAR OLD TREE ON OUR PLANTATIONS\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       England Likes Hess Pecans\r\n\r\n  _In Gardening, Illustrated_, a prominent weekly published in London,\r\n  England, we read: “The shells of the Hess Brand Paper Shell Pecans\r\n  are thin and easily broken and the body of the nut in this variety\r\n  is larger, fuller and better flavored than is usual with pecans. The\r\n  pecan may rightly be regarded as a food of very highest value. It\r\n  contains 70 per cent. of fat. Its texture is delicate, and it can be\r\n  digested easily. * * * The demand for the Paper Shell Pecan is\r\n  constantly increasing and is well in front of the supply.”\r\n\r\n=The pecan is the surest of profitable crops=—because after the first\r\nfive years, during which we assume all the risks, the pecan is among the\r\nhardiest of trees. Gathering the nuts and selling them represents the\r\nbulk of the effort required after that.\r\n\r\n=You cannot be deceived on this score=—the plan on page 38 shows that\r\nour interests are mutual. Would we deceive ourselves—could we afford to\r\ntake any chances if we did not know that the pecan is as hardy a tree as\r\nthe hickory or oak, and a surer profit payer than any other crop of any\r\nsort?\r\n\r\nWe could not have such assurance on a fruit tree—for every farmer knows\r\nthat apples and peaches are subject to many perils of frost, storm,\r\nblight, borer, and of loss in shipment. Pecans are hardier than hickory\r\nnuts, they cannot be shaken off the tree till ripe. Citrus fruits—like\r\noranges and grape fruit—are liable to frost, and spoil so quickly that\r\nit is impossible to hold them long before marketing. Paper Shell Pecans\r\ncan be held a year without losing their delicious flavor and nutritive\r\nvalue; for nature has provided them with a perfect container (shell)\r\nwhich shuts out impurities and prevents deterioration.\r\n\r\nThere can be no glut of fine pecans—because they can be raised only in\r\nlimited territory, they have the whole world for a market and the whole\r\nyear for a selling season. As the famous Luther Burbank well says (see\r\npage 26): “=We have now one pecan where we ought to have a million to\r\ncreate a market.=”\r\n\r\nAn assured increasing market for perfected pecans, at an excellent\r\nprofit, is back of every dollar you invest here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Who Should Invest In Keystone Pecan Orchards?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young man]\r\n\r\nThe young man. To provide an income for later years. “He must,” says the\r\nAmerican Fruit and Nut Journal, “look to a business that will increase\r\nin value and returns. The improved pecan orchard fulfills all these\r\nrequirements. It is safe, pays little at the beginning, but increases\r\nits income gradually, and when ten or fifteen years old will yield ten\r\ntimes more than the same money would in any other business.”\r\n\r\n  In Health Culture, for December, 1915, we read: “There is but a\r\n  small territory in the United States in which soil conditions and\r\n  climate are right for pecans. Of the half million budded pecan trees\r\n  in the world nearly half are in Calhoun and Dougherty Counties,\r\n  Georgia. Sufficient is known of the yield to claim that this half of\r\n  the budded trees has produced far more than one-half of the crop.”\r\n\r\n  “The chief interest in the pecan centers in its high food value for\r\n  mankind. The flavor is greatly in its favor; also the pecan\r\n  surpasses all others in the percentage of fat, the comparison being\r\n  made with walnuts, peanuts, filberts, almonds, and cocoanuts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Who Should Invest In Keystone Pecan Orchards?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The man of middle age and above]\r\n\r\nTo provide now while his earning power is at its greatest, for those\r\nyears when his energy begins to ebb—=let him plant his money where it\r\ngrows=.

It\r\nwill lighten your burdens while here, and when you are gone your\r\nchildren and your children’s children will rise up and call you\r\nblessed.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Husbands and parents]\r\n\r\nTo provide an annuity for their wives and families, which will exceed in\r\nannual return any equal investment for the purpose and which will yield\r\na growing income each year.

There should be some\r\nprovision for the years of reduced earning power—when conditions beyond\r\nyour control cut into a mere fraction the satisfactory income of last\r\nyear. Because pecan orchards have their foundation in land, because\r\nNature yields her crops abundantly despite wars and panics, because the\r\ndemand for Paper Shell Pecans was not affected by the hard times in the\r\nwinter of 1914–15, you know that here is a dependable source of income.\r\nThe period of uncertainty on pecans is the first five years—when we\r\nassume the risk!\r\n\r\n                 “For want and age save while you may,\r\n                 No morning sun shines the whole day.”\r\n\r\nsays Ben Franklin.

The\r\nright to change the beneficiary is reserved to the unit holder, provided\r\nhe notifies the Company in writing.\r\n\r\n                In case of my death please make deed to\r\n\r\n                      ——————————————————————————-\r\n                   (Here insert name of beneficiary)\r\n\r\n                      ——————————————————————————-\r\n                        (Signature of purchaser)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    $10 Down Per Unit, $10 Per Month\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A discount of ten per cent. for full cash payment]\r\n\r\nEach Orchard Unit will be sold under the following conditions: $10 down\r\nwhen application is made for the Orchard Unit, and $10 per month per\r\nUnit until it is paid in full. No interest is charged on deferred\r\npayments. Should one prefer to pay full cash for one’s Orchard Unit, a\r\ndiscount of ten per cent. will be allowed on the amount of cash paid,\r\nand the deed will be delivered at once.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of an application, together with the first payment, an\r\nOrchard contract will be prepared and executed and forwarded. Upon the\r\ncompletion of the payments, the deed will be delivered.\r\n\r\nRemember that the price quoted covers every expense of the five-year\r\ndevelopment period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A home site on your units]\r\n\r\nThe contract of sale shows that the purchaser may, after the five-year\r\ndevelopment period is over, locate his home on his units and look after\r\nhis own trees, managing his property entirely independent of the\r\ncompany. But we believe that our management and our method of marketing\r\nwill prove so economical, efficient and satisfactory that the unit\r\nowners will always want the company to manage their units and harvest\r\nand market their pecans for them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Units full paid in case of death]\r\n\r\nIf any unit owner, who is paying for his unit on the monthly payment\r\nplan, and who has made all his payments promptly on the dates called for\r\nby the contract, should die after twelve monthly payments in addition to\r\nthe initial payment, and all subsequent payments having become due up to\r\nthe time of his death have been paid, but before his entire contract\r\nprice has been paid in full, the company will upon satisfactory proof of\r\ndeath furnish to his heirs a deed to his unit or units and all further\r\npayments on the same shall cease. This plan protects the family or\r\nestate of the unit holder who meets his monthly payments promptly\r\nagainst all possibility of loss due to his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Pecan Tree—Nature’s Most Powerful Food Producer\r\n\r\n  A leading farm paper, in an article on pecans, published the\r\n  following, “The nut is nutritious, very nutritious, and we already\r\n  have numerous instances of one good big tree making more human food\r\n  than the best acre of blue grass in all Kentucky. Plainly, the\r\n  tree-nut method beats the grass-meat method of feeding men. Tree\r\n  crops are to be the agriculture of the future.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  In natural colors from photograph of Lake Marcelia, taken week of June\r\n    16, 1919.
