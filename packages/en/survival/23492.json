Ballantyne.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nThis little book describes a visit up to the Arctic regions, that was\r\nsupposed to have taken place long before the book was written, in other\r\nwords in the early part of the nineteenth century.  The purpose of the\r\njourney was to get near to the North Pole, which was considered to be\r\nsurrounded by a large area of ice-free water. The vessel in which they\r\nsailed became beset by ice, and could not be moved.  They met with\r\nEsquimaux, and saw how they survived, how they killed walrus, how they\r\ncaught birds, and how they lived in their ice-houses, or igloos.  They\r\nalso had several encounters with polar bears, and musk-ox.\r\n\r\nEventually they have been in the ice for a couple of years, and some of\r\nthe men are suffering from scurvy.  Europeans get scurvy from lack of\r\nfruit and vegetables, but this condition doesn't seem to affect the\r\nEsquimaux, whose meat and fat diet does not cause them to have heart\r\ndisorders, either.\r\n\r\nThe crew eventually abandon the vessel, which has been crushed suddenly\r\nand totally by a stream of ice-floes, and are obliged to walk out of\r\nwhere they had spent so much time.  Luckily, when at their last gasp,\r\nthey find an Esquimaux village, where they learn that there is a Danish\r\nsettlement not too far away, and that from it they can take ship for\r\nEurope, and eventually make their way back to Britain.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nFAST IN THE ICE, ADVENTURES IN THE POLAR REGIONS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nOne day, many years ago, a brig cast off from her moorings, and sailed\r\nfrom a British port for the Polar Seas.  That brig never came back.\r\n\r\nMany a hearty cheer was given, many a kind wish was uttered, many a\r\nhandkerchief was waved, and many a tearful eye gazed that day as the\r\nvessel left Old England, and steered her course into the unknown regions\r\nof the far north.\r\n\r\nBut no cheer ever greeted her return; no bright eyes ever watched her\r\nhomeward-bound sails rising on the far-off horizon.\r\n\r\nBattered by the storms of the Arctic seas, her sails and cordage\r\nstiffened by the frosts, and her hull rasped and shattered by the ice of\r\nthose regions, she was forced on a shore where the green grass has\r\nlittle chance to grow, where winter reigns nearly all the year round,\r\nwhere man never sends his merchandise, and never drives his plough.\r\nThere the brig was frozen in; there, for two long years, she lay unable\r\nto move, and her starving crew forsook her; there, year after year, she\r\nlay, unknown, unvisited by civilised man, and unless the wild Eskimos\r\n[see note 1] have torn her to pieces, and made spears of her timbers, or\r\nthe ice has swept her out to sea and whirled her to destruction, there\r\nshe lies still--hard and fast in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was lost, but her crew were saved, and most of them returned\r\nto tell their kinsfolk of the wonders and the dangers of the frozen\r\nregions, where God has created some of the most beautiful and some of\r\nthe most awful objects that were ever looked on by the eye of man.\r\n\r\nWhat was told by the fireside, long ago, is now recounted in this book.\r\n\r\nImagine a tall, strong man, of about five-and-forty, with short, curly\r\nblack hair, just beginning to turn grey; stern black eyes, that look as\r\nif they could pierce into your secret thoughts; a firm mouth, with lines\r\nof good-will and kindness lurking about it; a deeply-browned skin, and a\r\nshort, thick beard and moustache.  That is a portrait of the commander\r\nof the brig.  His name was Harvey.  He stood on the deck, close by the\r\nwheel, looking wistfully over the stern.  As the vessel bent before the\r\nbreeze, and cut swiftly through the water, a female hand was raised\r\namong the gazers on the pier, and a white scarf waved in the breeze.  In\r\nthe forefront of the throng, and lower down, another hand was raised; it\r\nwas a little one, but very vigorous; it whirled a cap round a small head\r\nof curly black hair, and a shrill \"hurrah!\" came floating out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain kissed his hand and waved his hat in reply; then, wheeling\r\nsuddenly round, he shouted, in a voice of thunder:\r\n\r\n\"Mind your helm, there; let her away a point.  Take a pull on these\r\nforetopsail halyards; look alive, lads!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied the men.\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion whatever for these orders.  The captain knew that\r\nwell enough, but he had his own reasons for giving them.  The men knew\r\nthat, too, and they understood his reasons when they observed the\r\nincreased sternness of his eyes, and the compression of his lips.\r\n\r\nInclination and duty!  What wars go on in the hearts of men--high and\r\nlow, rich and poor--between these two.  What varied fortune follows man,\r\naccording as the one or the other carries the day.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" said a gruff, broad-shouldered, and extremely short man,\r\nwith little or no forehead, a hard, vacant face, and a pair of enormous\r\nred whispers; \"please, sir, Sam Baker's took very bad; I think it would\r\nbe as well if you could give him a little physic, sir; a tumbler of\r\nEpsom, or some-think of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr Dicey, there can't be anything very far wrong with Baker,\"\r\nsaid the captain, looking down at his second mate; \"he seems to me one\r\nof the healthiest men in the ship.  What's the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't say, sir,\" replied Mr Dicey, \"but he looks 'orrible bad,\r\nall yellow and green about the gills, and fearful red round the eyes.\r\nBut what frightens me most is that I heard him groanin' very heavy about\r\na quarter of an hour ago, and then I saw him suddenly fling himself into\r\nhis 'ammock and begin blubberin' like a child.  Now, sir, I say, when a\r\ngrow'd-up man gives way like that, there must be some-think far wrong\r\nwith his inside.  And it's a serious thing, sir, to take a sick man on\r\nsuch a voyage as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he not say what's wrong with him?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; he don't.  He says it's nothin', and he'll be all right if\r\nhe's only let alone.  I did hear him once or twice muttering some-think\r\nabout his wife and child; you know, sir, he's got a young wife, and she\r\nhad a baby about two months 'fore we came away, but I can't think that's\r\ngot much to do with it, for _I've_ got a wife myself, sir, and six\r\nchildren, two of 'em bein' babies, and that don't upset _me_, and\r\nBaker's a much stronger man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr Dicey, he is a much stronger man than you,\" replied\r\nthe captain, \"and I doubt not that his strength will enable him to get\r\nover this without the aid of physic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Mr Dicey.\r\n\r\nThe second mate was a man whose countenance never showed any signs of\r\nemotion, no matter what he felt.  He seldom laughed, or, if he did, his\r\nmouth remained almost motionless, and the sounds that came out were\r\nanything but cheerful.  He had light grey eyes which always wore an\r\nexpression of astonishment; but the expression was accidental; it\r\nindicated no feeling.  He would have said, \"Very well, sir,\" if the\r\ncaptain had refused to give poor Baker food instead of physic.\r\n\r\n\"And hark'ee, Mr Dicey,\" said the captain, \"don't let him be disturbed\r\ntill he feels inclined to move.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied the second mate, touching his cap as he turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" murmured the captain, as he gazed earnestly at the now distant\r\nshore, \"I'm not the only one who carries a heavy heart to sea this day\r\nand leaves sorrowing hearts behind him.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote 1.  This word is here spelled as pronounced.  It is usually spelled\r\nEsquimaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nAT SEA--THE FIRST STORM.\r\n\r\nIt is now hundreds of years since the North polar regions began to\r\nattract general attention.  Men have long felt very inquisitive about\r\nthat part of the earth, and many good ships, many noble lives have been\r\nlost in trying to force a passage through the ice that encumbers the\r\nArctic seas, summer and winter.  Britain has done more than other\r\nnations in the cause of discovery within the Arctic circle.  The last\r\nand greatest of her Arctic heroes perished there--the famous Sir John\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nWere I writing a history of those regions I would have much to say of\r\nother countries as well as of our own.  But such is not my object in\r\nthis book.  I mean simply to follow in the wake of one of Britain's\r\nadventurous discoverers, and thus give the reader an idea of the\r\nfortunes of those gallant men who risk life and limb for the sake of\r\nobtaining knowledge of distant lands.\r\n\r\nThere have always been restless spirits in this country.  There have\r\never been men who, when boys, were full of mischief, and who could\r\n\"settle to nothing\" when they grew up.  Lucky for us, lucky for the\r\nworld, that such is the case!  Many of our \"restless spirits,\" as we\r\ncall them, have turned out to be our heroes, our discoverers, our\r\ngreatest men.  No doubt many of them have become our drones, our\r\nsharpers, our blacklegs.  But that is just saying that some men are\r\ngood, while others are bad--no blame is due to what is called the\r\nrestlessness of spirit.  Our restless men, if good, find rest in action;\r\nin bold energetic toil; if bad, they find rest, alas! in untimely\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nCaptain Harvey was one of our restless spirits.  He had a deeply learned\r\nfriend who said to him one day that he felt sure \"_there was a sea of\r\nopen water round the North Pole_!\"  Hundreds of ships had tried to reach\r\nthat pole without success, because they always found a barrier of thick\r\nice raised against them.  This friend said that if a ship could only cut\r\nor force its way through the ice to a certain latitude north, open water\r\nwould be found.  Captain Harvey was much interested in this.  He could\r\nnot rest until he had proved it.  He had plenty of money, so had his\r\nfriend.  They resolved to buy a vessel and send it to the seas lying\r\nwithin the Arctic circle.  Other rich friends helped them; a brig was\r\nbought, it was named the _Hope_, and, as we have seen in the last\r\nchapter, it finally set sail under command of Captain Harvey.\r\n\r\nMany days and nights passed, and the _Hope_ kept her course steadily\r\ntoward the coast of North America.  Greenland was the first land they\r\nhoped to see.  Baffin's Bay was the strait through which they hoped to\r\nreach the open polar sea.\r\n\r\nThe _Hope_ left England as a whaler, with all the boats, lances,\r\nharpoons, lines, and other apparatus used in the whale fishery.  It was\r\nintended that she should do a little business in that way if Captain\r\nHarvey thought it advisable, but the discovery of new lands and seas was\r\ntheir chief end and aim.\r\n\r\nAt first the weather was fine, the wind fair, and the voyage prosperous.\r\nBut one night there came a deep calm.  Not a breath of air moved over\r\nthe sea, which was as clear and polished as a looking-glass.  The\r\ncaptain walked the deck with the surgeon of the ship, a nephew of his\r\nown, named Gregory.\r\n\r\nTom Gregory was a youth of about nineteen, who had not passed through\r\nthe whole course of a doctor's education, but who was a clever fellow,\r\nand better able to cut and carve and physic poor suffering humanity than\r\nmany an older man who wrote M.D. after his name.  He was a fine,\r\nhandsome, strapping fellow, with a determined manner and a kind heart.\r\nHe was able to pull an oar with the best man aboard, and could even\r\nsteer the brig in fine weather, if need be.  He was hearty and romantic,\r\nand a great favourite with the men.  He, too, was a restless spirit.  He\r\nhad grown tired of college life, and had made up his mind to take a\r\nyear's run into the Polar regions, by way of improving his knowledge of\r\nthe \"outlandish\" parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the look of the sky to-day, Tom,\" said the captain,\r\nglancing at the horizon and then at the sails.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said Tom, in surprise.  \"It seems to me the most beautiful\r\nafternoon we have had since the voyage began.  But I suppose you seamen\r\nare learned in signs which we landsmen do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we are,\" replied the captain; \"but it does not require much\r\nknowledge of the weather to say that such a dead calm as this, and such\r\nunusual heat, is not likely to end in a gentle breeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't object to a stiff breeze, uncle?\" said the youth.\r\n\r\n\"No, Tom; but I don't like a storm, because it does us no good, and may\r\ndo us harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Storms do you no good, uncle!\" cried Tom; \"how can you say so?  Why,\r\nwhat is it that makes our sailors such trumps?  The British tar would\r\nnot be able to face danger as he does if there were no storms.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Tom, but the British tar would not require to face danger at all\r\nif there were no storms.  What says the barometer, Mr Mansell?\" said\r\nthe captain, looking down the skylight into the cabin, where the first\r\nmate--a middle-sized man of thirty-five, or thereabouts--was seated at\r\nthe table writing up the ship's log-book.\r\n\r\n\"The glass has gone down an inch, sir, and is still falling,\" answered\r\nthe mate.\r\n\r\n\"Reef the topsail, Mr Dicey,\" cried the captain, on hearing this.\r\n\r\n\"Why such haste?\" inquired Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"Because such a sudden fall in the barometer is a sure sign of\r\napproaching bad weather,\" answered the captain.\r\n\r\nThe first man on the shrouds and out upon the main-topsail yard was Sam\r\nBaker, whose active movements and hearty manner showed that he had quite\r\nrecovered his health without the use of physic.  He was quickly followed\r\nby some of his shipmates, all of whom were picked men--able in body and\r\nready for anything.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes sail was reduced.  Soon after that clouds began to rise\r\non the horizon and spread over the sky.  Before half an hour had passed\r\nthe breeze came--came far stronger than had been expected--and the order\r\nto take in sail had to be repeated.  Baker was first again.  He was\r\nclosely followed by Joe Davis and Jim Croft, both of them sturdy\r\nfellows--good specimens of the British seaman.  Davy Butts, who came\r\nnext, was not so good a specimen.  He was nearly six feet high, very\r\nthin and loosely put together, like a piece of bad furniture.  But his\r\nbones were big, and he was stronger than he looked.  He would not have\r\nformed one of such a crew had he not been a good man.  The rest of the\r\ncrew, of whom there were eighteen, not including the officers, were of\r\nall shapes, sizes, and complexions.\r\n\r\nThe sails had scarcely been taken in when the storm burst on the brig in\r\nall its fury.  The waves rose like mountains and followed after her, as\r\nif they were eager to swallow her up.  The sky grew dark overhead as the\r\nnight closed in, the wind shrieked through the rigging, and the rag of\r\ncanvas that they ventured to hoist seemed about to burst away from the\r\nyard.  It was an awful night.  Such a night as causes even reckless men\r\nto feel how helpless they are--how dependent on the arm of God.  The\r\ngale steadily increased until near midnight, when it blew a perfect\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\n\"It's a dirty night,\" observed the captain, to the second mate, as the\r\nlatter came on deck to relieve the watch.\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir,\" replied Mr Dicey, as coolly as if he were about to sit\r\ndown to a good dinner on shore.  Mr Dicey was a remarkably\r\nmatter-of-fact man.  He looked upon a storm as he looked upon a fit of\r\nthe toothache--a thing that had to be endured, and was not worth making\r\na fuss about.\r\n\r\n\"It won't last long,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; it won't,\" answered Mr Dicey.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Dicey did not seem inclined to say more, the captain went below\r\nand flung himself on a locker, having given orders that he should be\r\ncalled if any change for the worse took place in the weather.  Soon\r\nafterward a tremendous sea rose high over the stern, and part of it fell\r\non the deck with a terrible crash, washing Mr Dicey into the\r\nlee-scuppers, and almost sweeping him overboard.  On regaining his feet,\r\nand his position beside the wheel, the second mate shook himself and\r\nconsidered whether he ought to call the captain.  Having meditated some\r\ntime, he concluded that the weather was no worse, although it had\r\ntreated him very roughly, so he did not disturb the captain's repose.\r\n\r\nThus the storm raged all that night.  It tossed the _Hope_ about like a\r\ncork; it well-nigh blew the sails off the masts, and almost blew Mr\r\nDicey's head off his shoulders! then it stopped as it had begun--\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nIN THE ICE--DANGERS OF ARCTIC VOYAGING.\r\n\r\nNext morning the _Hope_ was becalmed in the midst of a scene more\r\nbeautiful than the tongue or the pen of man can describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose that day, it shone upon what appeared to be a field of\r\nglass and a city of crystal.  Every trace of the recent storm was gone\r\nexcept a long swell, which caused the brig to roll considerably, but\r\nwhich did not break the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIce was to be seen all round as far as the eye could reach.  Ice in\r\nevery form and size imaginable.  And the wonderful thing about it was\r\nthat many of the masses resembled the buildings of a city.  There were\r\nhouses, and churches, and monuments, and spires, and ruins.  There were\r\nalso islands and mountains!  Some of the pieces were low and flat, no\r\nbigger than a boat; others were tall, with jagged tops; some of the\r\nfields, as they are called, were a mile and more in extent, and there\r\nwere a number of bergs, or ice-mountains, higher than the brig's\r\ntopmasts.  These last were almost white, but they had, in many places, a\r\ngreenish-blue colour that was soft and beautiful.  The whole scene shone\r\nand sparkled so brilliantly in the morning sun, that one could almost\r\nfancy it was one of the regions of fairyland!\r\n\r\nWhen young Gregory came on the quarter-deck, no one was there except Jim\r\nCroft, a short, thick-set man, with the legs of a dwarf and the\r\nshoulders of a giant.  He stood at the helm, and although no steering\r\nwas required, as there was no wind, he kept his hands on the spokes of\r\nthe wheel, and glanced occasionally at the compass.  The first mate, who\r\nhad the watch on deck, was up at the masthead, observing the state of\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\n\"How glorious!\" exclaimed the youth, as he swept his sparkling eye round\r\nthe horizon.  \"Ah, Croft! is not this splendid?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, sir,\" said the seaman, turning the large quid of tobacco that\r\nbulged out his left cheek.  \"It's very beautiful, no doubt, but it's\r\ncomin' rather thick for my taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" inquired Gregory.  \"There seems to me plenty of open water to\r\nenable us to steer clear of these masses.  Besides, as we have no wind,\r\nit matters little, I should think, whether we have room to sail or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've not seed much o' the ice yet, that's plain,\" said Croft, \"else\r\nyou'd know that the floes are closin' round us, an' we'll soon be fast\r\nin the pack, if a breeze don't spring up to help us.\"\r\n\r\nAs the reader may not, perhaps, understand the terms used by Arctic\r\nvoyagers in regard to the ice in its various forms, it may be as well\r\nhere to explain the meaning of those most commonly used.\r\n\r\nWhen ice is seen floating in small detached pieces and scattered masses,\r\nit is called \"floe\" ice, and men speak of getting among the floes.  When\r\nthese floes close up, so that the whole sea seems to be covered with\r\nthem, and little water can be seen, it is called \"pack\" ice.  When the\r\npack is squeezed together, so that lumps of it are forced up in the form\r\nof rugged mounds, these mounds are called \"hummocks.\"  A large mass of\r\nflat ice, varying from one mile to many miles in extent, is called a\r\n\"field,\" and a mountain of ice is called a \"berg.\"\r\n\r\nAll the ice here spoken of, except the berg, is sea-ice; formed by the\r\nfreezing of the ocean in winter.  The berg is formed in a very different\r\nmanner.  Of this more shall be said in a future chapter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lad,\" said Gregory, in reply to Jim Croft's last observation,\r\n\"I have not seen much of the ice yet, as you truly remark, so I hope\r\nthat the wind will not come to help us out of it for some time.  You\r\ndon't think it dangerous to get into the pack, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not exactly dangerous, sir,\" replied Croft, \"but I must say that\r\nit aint safe, 'specially when there's a swell on like this.  But that'll\r\ngo down soon.  D'ye know what a nip is, Dr Gregory?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I do; at least I have read of such a thing.  But I should be\r\nvery glad to hear what you have to say about it.  No doubt you have felt\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felt one!\" cried Jim, screwing up his face and drawing his limbs\r\ntogether, as if he were suffering horrible pain, \"no, I've never felt\r\none.  The man what _feels_ a nip aint likely to live to tell what his\r\nfeelin's was.  But I've _seed_ one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've seen one, have you?  That must have been interesting.  Where was\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very far from the Greenland coast,\" said Croft, giving his quid\r\nanother turn.  \"This was the way of it.  You must know that there was\r\ntwo ships of us in company at the time.  Whalers we was.  We got into\r\nthe heart of the pack somehow, and we thought we'd never get out of it\r\nagain.  There was nothin' but ice all round us as far as the eye could\r\nsee.  The name of our ship was the _Nancy_.  Our comrade was the\r\n_Bullfinch_.  One mornin' early we heard a loud noise of ice rubbin'\r\nagin the sides o' the ship, so we all jumped up, an' on deck as fast as\r\nwe could, for there's short time given to save ourselves in them seas\r\nsometimes.  The whole pack, we found, was in motion, and a wide lead of\r\nwater opened up before us, for all the world like a smooth river or\r\ncanal windin' through the pack.  Into this we warped the ship, and\r\nhoistin' sail, steered away cheerily.  We passed close to the\r\n_Bullfinch_, which was still hard and fast in the pack, and we saw that\r\nher crew were sawin' and cuttin' away at the ice, tryin' to get into the\r\nlead that we'd got into.  So we hailed them, and said we would wait for\r\n'em outside the pack, if we got through.  But the words were no sooner\r\nspoken, when the wind it died away, and we were becalmed about half a\r\nmile from the _Bullfinch_.\r\n\r\n\"`You'd better go down to breakfast, boys,' says our captain, says he,\r\n`the breeze won't be long o' comin' again.'\r\n\r\n\"So down the men went, and soon after that the steward comes on deck,\r\nand, says he to the captain, `Breakfast, sir.'  `Very good,' says the\r\ncaptain, and down he went too, leavin' me at the wheel and the mate in\r\ncharge of the deck.  He'd not been gone three minutes when I noticed\r\nthat the great field of ice on our right was closin' in on the field on\r\nour left, and the channel we was floatin' in was closin' up.  The mate\r\nnoticed it, too, but he wouldn't call the captain 'cause the ice came so\r\nslowly and quietly on that for a few minutes we could hardly believe it\r\nwas movin' and everything around us looked so calm and peaceful like\r\nthat it was difficult to believe our danger was so great.  But this was\r\nonly a momentary feelin', d'ye see.  A minute after that the mate he\r\ncries down to the captain:--\r\n\r\n\"`Ice closin' up, sir!'\r\n\r\n\"And the captain he runs on deck.  By this time there was no mistake\r\nabout it; the ice was close upon us.  It was clear that we were to have\r\na nip.  So the captain roars down the hatchway, `Tumble up there! tumble\r\nup! every man alive! for your lives!'  And sure enough they did tumble\r\nup, as I never seed 'em do it before--two or three of 'em was sick; they\r\ncame up with their clothes in their hands.  The ice was now almost\r\ntouchin' our sides, and I tell _you_, sir, I never did feel so queerish\r\nin all my life before as when I looked over the side at the edge of that\r\ngreat field of ice which rose three foot out o' the water, and was, I\r\nsuppose, six foot more below the surface.  It came on so slow that we\r\ncould hardly see the motion.  Inch by inch the water narrowed between it\r\nand our sides.  At last it touched on the left side, and that shoved us\r\nquicker on to the field on our right.  Every eye was fixed on it--every\r\nman held his breath.  You might have heard a pin fall on the deck.  It\r\ntouched gently at first, then there was a low grindin' and crunchin'\r\nsound.  The ship trembled as if it had been a livin' creetur, and the\r\nbeams began to crack.  Now, you must know, sir, that when a nip o' this\r\nsort takes a ship the ice usually eases off, after giving her a good\r\nsqueeze, or when the pressure is too much for her, the ice slips under\r\nher bottom and lifts her right out o' the water.  But our _Nancy_ was\r\nwhat we call wall-sided.  She was never fit to sail in them seas.  The\r\nconsequence was that the ice crushed her sides in.  The moment the\r\ncaptain heard the beams begin to go he knew it was all up with the ship;\r\nso he roared to take to the ice for our lives!  You may be sure we took\r\nhis advice.  Over the side we went, every man Jack of us, and got on the\r\nice.  We did not take time to save an article belongin' to us; and it\r\nwas as well we did not, for the ice closed up with a crash, and we heard\r\nthe beams and timbers rending like a fire of musketry in the hold.  Her\r\nbottom must have been cut clean away, for she stood on the ice just as\r\nshe had floated on the sea.  Then the noise stopped, the ice eased off,\r\nand the ship began to settle.  The lead of water opened up again; in ten\r\nminutes after that the _Nancy_ went to the bottom and left us standing\r\nthere on the ice.\r\n\r\n\"It was the mercy of God that let it happen so near the _Bullfinch_.  We\r\nmight have been out o' sight o' that ship at the time, and then every\r\nman of us would have bin lost.  As it was, we had a hard scramble over a\r\ngood deal of loose ice, jumpin' from lump to lump, and some of us\r\nfallin' into the water several times, before we got aboard.  Now that\r\nwas a bad nip, sir, warn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly was,\" replied Gregory; \"and although I delight in being\r\namong the ice, I sincerely hope that our tight little brig may not be\r\ntried in the same way.  But she is better able to stand it, I should\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"That she is, sir,\" replied Croft, with much confidence.  \"I seed her in\r\ndock, sir, when they was a-puttin' of extra timbers on the bow, and I do\r\nbelieve she would stand twice as much bad usage as the _Nancy_ got,\r\nthough she is only half the size.\"\r\n\r\nJim Croft's opinion on this point was well founded, for the _Hope_ had\r\nindeed been strengthened and prepared for her ice battles with the\r\ngreatest care, by men of experience and ability.  As some readers may be\r\ninterested in this subject, I shall give a brief account of the\r\nadditions that were made to her hull.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was nearly two hundred tons burden.  She had originally been\r\nbuilt very strongly, and might even have ventured on a voyage to the\r\nPolar seas just as she was.  But Captain Harvey resolved to take every\r\nprecaution to insure the success of his voyage, and the safety and\r\ncomfort of his men.  He, therefore, had the whole of the ship's bottom\r\nsheathed with thick hardwood planking, which was carried up above her\r\nwater-line, as high as the ordinary floe-ice would be likely to reach.\r\nThe hull inside was strengthened with stout cross-beams, as well as with\r\nbeams running along the length of the vessel, and in every part that was\r\nlikely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were fastened.  But\r\nthe bow of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed\r\nat.  Inside, just behind the cutwater, the whole space was so traversed\r\nby cross-beams of oak that it almost became a solid mass, and outside\r\nthe sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giant's chisel.\r\nThe false keel was taken off, the whole vessel, in short, was rendered\r\nas strong, outside and in, as wood and iron and skill could make her.\r\nIt need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were\r\nmade with the greatest care and without regard to expense, for although\r\nthe owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money, they set too\r\nhigh a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few\r\npounds.  She was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half.  But\r\nthis was in case of accidents, for Captain Harvey did not intend to be\r\nabsent much longer than one year.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to our story:\r\n\r\nJim Croft's fear that they would be set fast was realised sooner than he\r\nexpected.  The floes began to close in, from no cause that could be\r\nseen, for the wind was quite still, and in a short time the loose ice\r\npressed against the _Hope_ on all sides.  It seemed to young Gregory as\r\nif the story that the seaman had just related was about to be enacted\r\nover again; and, being a stranger to ice, he could not help feeling a\r\nlittle uneasy for some time.  But there was in reality little or no\r\ndanger, for the pressure was light, and the brig had got into a small\r\nbay in the edge of an ice-field, which lay in the midst of the smaller\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was little prospect of the pack opening up just then,\r\nthe captain ordered the ice-anchors to be got out and fixed.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the sea from the brig's deck was now extremely wintry,\r\nbut very bright and cheerful.  Not a spot of blue water was to be seen\r\nin any direction.  The whole ocean appeared as if it had been frozen\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIt was now past noon, and the sun's rays were warm, although the\r\nquantity of ice around rendered the air cold.  As the men were returning\r\nfrom fixing the anchors, the captain looked over the side, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It's not likely that we shall move out of this for some hours.  What\r\nsay you, lads, to a game of football?\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal was received with a loud cheer.  The ball had been prepared\r\nby the sail-maker, in expectation of some such opportunity as this.  It\r\nwas at once tossed over the side; those men who were not already on the\r\nfield scrambled out of the brig, and the entire crew went leaping and\r\nyelling over the ice with the wild delight of schoolboys let loose for\r\nan unexpected holiday.\r\n\r\nThey were in the middle of the game when a loud shout came from the\r\nbrig, and the captain's voice was heard singing out:\r\n\r\n\"All hands ahoy! come aboard.  Look alive!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the men turned, and there was a general race toward the brig,\r\nwhich lay nearly a quarter of a mile distant from them.\r\n\r\nIn summer, changes in the motions of the ice take place in the most\r\nunexpected manner.  Currents in the ocean are, no doubt, the chief cause\r\nof these; the action of winds has also something to do with them.  One\r\nof these changes was now taking place.  Almost before the men got on\r\nboard the ice had separated, and long canals of water were seen opening\r\nup here and there.  Soon after that a light breeze sprang up, the\r\nice-anchors were taken aboard, the sails trimmed, and soon the _Hope_\r\nwas again making her way slowly but steadily to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES, TROUBLES, AND DANGERS.\r\n\r\nFor some hours the brig proceeded onward with a freshening breeze,\r\nwinding and turning in order to avoid the lumps of ice.  Many of the\r\nsmaller pieces were not worth turning out of the way of, the mere weight\r\nof the vessel being sufficient to push them aside.\r\n\r\nUp to this time they had succeeded in steering clear of everything\r\nwithout getting a thump; but they got one at last, which astonished\r\nthose among the crew who had not been in the ice before.  The captain,\r\nGregory, and Dicey were seated in the cabin at the time taking tea.  Ned\r\nDawkins, the steward, an active little man, was bringing in a tea-pot\r\nwith a second supply of tea.  In his left hand he carried a tray of\r\nbiscuit.  The captain sat at the head of the table, Dicey at the foot,\r\nand the doctor at the side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a tremendous shock was felt!  The captain's cup of tea leaped\r\naway from him and flooded the centre of the table.  The doctor's cup was\r\nempty; he seized the table with both hands and remained steady; but\r\nDicey's cup happened to be at his lips at the moment, and was quite\r\nfull.  The effect on him was unfortunate.  He was thrown violently on\r\nhis back, and the tea poured over his face and drenched his hair as he\r\nlay sprawling on the floor.  The steward saved himself by dropping the\r\nbread-tray and grasping the handle of the cabin door.  So violent was\r\nthe shock that the ship's bell was set a-ringing.\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, gentlemen,\" cried the first mate, looking down the\r\nskylight.  \"I forgot to warn you.  The ice is getting rather thick\r\naround us, and I had to charge a lump of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well to beg pardon,\" said the captain, \"but that won't\r\nmend my crockery!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or dry my head,\" growled Mr Dicey; \"it's as bad as if I'd been dipped\r\noverboard, it is.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Mr Dicey's grumbling remarks were finished all three of them had\r\nreached the deck.  The wind had freshened considerably, and the brig was\r\nrushing in a somewhat alarming manner among the floes.  It required the\r\nmost careful attention to prevent her striking heavily.\r\n\r\n\"If it goes on like this, we shall have to reduce sail,\" observed the\r\ncaptain.  \"See, there is a neck of ice ahead that will stop us.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be probable, for the lane of water along which they were\r\nsteering was, just ahead of them, stopped by a neck of ice that\r\nconnected two floe-pieces.  The water beyond was pretty free from ice,\r\nbut this neck or mass seemed so thick that it became a question whether\r\nthey should venture to charge it or shorten sail.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by the fore- and main-topsail braces!\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr Mansell,\" said he, with a smile, \"we have come to our first\r\nreal difficulty.  What do you advise; shall we back the topsails, or try\r\nwhat our little _Hope_ is made of, and charge the enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charge!\" answered the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said the captain, hastening to the bow to direct the\r\nsteersman.  \"Port your helm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady.\"\r\n\r\nThe brig was now about fifty yards from the neck of ice, tearing through\r\nthe water like a race-horse.  In another moment she was up to it and\r\nstruck it fair in the middle.  The stout little vessel quivered to her\r\nkeel under the shock, but she did not recoil.  She split the mass into\r\nfragments, and, bearing down all before her, sailed like a conqueror\r\ninto the clear water beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Well done the _Hope_!\" said the captain, as he walked aft, while a\r\ncheer burst from the men.\r\n\r\n\"I think she ought to be called the _Good Hope_ ever after this,\" said\r\nTom Gregory.  \"If she cuts her way through everything as easily as she\r\nhas cut through that neck of ice, we shall reach the North Pole itself\r\nbefore winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we reach the North Pole _at all_,\" observed Mr Dicey, \"I'll climb\r\nup to the top of it and stand on my head, I will!\"\r\n\r\nThe second mate evidently had no expectation of reaching that mysterious\r\npole, which men have so long and so often tried to find, in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Heavy ice ahead, sir,\" shouted Mr Mansell, who was at the masthead\r\nwith a telescope.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the weather bow, sir, the pack seems open enough to push through,\r\nbut the large bergs are numerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Hope_ was now indeed getting into the heart of those icy regions\r\nwhere ships are in constant danger from the floating masses that come\r\ndown with the ocean-currents from the far north.  In sailing along she\r\nwas often obliged to run with great violence against lumps so large that\r\nthey caused her whole frame to tremble, stout though it was.  \"Shall we\r\nsmash the lump, or will it stave in our bows?\" was a question that\r\nfrequently ran in the captain's mind.  Sometimes ice closed round her\r\nand squeezed the sides so that her beams cracked.  At other times, when\r\na large field was holding her fast, the smaller pieces would grind and\r\nrasp against her as they went past, until the crew fancied the whole of\r\nthe outer sheathing of planks had been scraped off.  Often she had to\r\npress close to ice-bergs of great size, and more than once a lump as\r\nlarge as a good-sized house fell off the ice-fields and plunged into the\r\nsea close to her side, causing her to rock violently on the waves that\r\nwere raised by it.\r\n\r\nIndeed the bergs are dangerous neighbours, not only from this cause, but\r\nalso on account of their turning upside down at times, and even falling\r\nto pieces, so that Captain Harvey always kept well out of their way when\r\nhe could; but this was not always possible.  The little brig had a\r\nnarrow escape one day from the falling of a berg.\r\n\r\nIt was a short time after that day on which they had the game of\r\nfootball.  They passed in safety through the floes and bergs that had\r\nbeen seen that evening, and got into open water beyond, where they made\r\nmade good progress before falling in with ice; but at last they came to\r\na part of Baffin's Bay where a great deal of ice is always found.  Here\r\nthe pack surrounded them, and compelled them to pass close to a berg\r\nwhich was the largest they had fallen in with up to that time.  It was\r\njagged in form, and high rather than broad.  Great peaks rose up from it\r\nlike the mountain tops of some wild highland region.  It was several\r\nhundred yards off the weather-beam when the brig passed, but it towered\r\nso high over the masts that it seemed to be much nearer than it was.\r\nThere was no apparent motion in this berg, and the waves beat and rolled\r\nupon its base just as they do on the shore of an island.  In fact it was\r\nas like an island as possible, or, rather, like a mountain planted in\r\nthe sea, only it was white instead of green.  There were cracks and\r\nrents and caverns in it, just as there are on a rugged mountain side,\r\nall of which were of a beautiful blue colour.  There were also slopes\r\nand crags and precipices, down which the water of the melted ice\r\nconstantly flowed in wild torrents.  Many of these were equal to small\r\nrivulets, and some of the waterfalls were beautiful.  The berg could not\r\nhave measured less than a mile round the base, and it was probably two\r\nhundred feet high.  It is well known that floating ice sinks deep, and\r\nthat there is about eight or ten times as much of it below as there is\r\nabove water.  The reader may therefore form some idea of what an\r\nenormous mass of ice this berg was.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Hope_ observed, in passing, that lumps were continually\r\nfalling from the cliffs into the sea.  The berg was evidently in a very\r\nrotten and dangerous state, and the captain ran the brig as close to the\r\npack on the other side as possible, in order to keep out of its way.\r\nJust as this was done, some great rents occurred, and suddenly a mass of\r\nice larger than the brig fell from the top of a cliff into the sea.  No\r\ndanger flowed from this, but the mass thus thrown off was so large as to\r\ndestroy the balance of the berg, and, to the horror of the sailors, the\r\nhuge mountain began to roll over.  Fortunately it fell in a direction\r\naway from the brig.  Had it rolled toward her, no human power could have\r\nsaved our voyagers.  The mighty mass went over with a wild hollow roar,\r\nand new peaks and cliffs rose out of the sea, as the old ones\r\ndisappeared, with great cataracts of uplifted brine pouring furiously\r\ndown their sides.\r\n\r\nApart from its danger, this was an awful sight.  Those who witnessed it\r\ncould only gaze in solemn silence.  Even the most careless among them\r\nmust have been forced to recognise the might and majesty of God in the\r\nevent, as well as His mercy in having led them to the _right_ side of\r\nthe berg at such a dangerous moment.\r\n\r\nBut the scene had not yet closed.  For some time the ice mountain rocked\r\ngrandly to and fro, raising a considerable swell on the sea, which, all\r\nround, was covered with the foam caused by this tremendous commotion.\r\nIn a few minutes several rents took place, sounding like the reports of\r\ngreat guns.  Rotten as it was, the berg could not stand the shock of its\r\nchange of position, for it had turned fairly upside down.  Crack after\r\ncrack took place, with deafening reports.  Lumps of all sizes fell from\r\nits sides.  Then there was a roar, long continued like thunder; a moment\r\nafter, the whole berg sank down in ruins, and, with a mighty crash, fell\r\nflat upon the sea!\r\n\r\nThe _Hope_ was beyond the reach of danger, but she rose and sank on the\r\nswell, caused by the ruin of this berg, for some time after.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of the same day that the brig received her first\r\nreally severe \"nip\" from the ice.\r\n\r\nShe had got deep into the pack, and was surrounded on all sides by large\r\nbergs, some of these being high, like the one that has just been\r\ndescribed, others low and flat but of great extent.  One, not far off,\r\nwas two miles long, and its glittering walls rose about fifteen feet\r\nabove the sea.  The sky was brighter than usual at the time.  This was\r\nowing to one of those strange appearances which one sees more of in the\r\nArctic regions than in any other part of the world.  The sun shone with\r\nunclouded splendour, and around it there were three mock suns almost as\r\nbright as the sun itself, one on each side and one directly above it.\r\nLearned men call these bright spots _parhelia_.  Sailors call them\r\nsun-dogs.  They were connected together with a ring of light which\r\nentirely encircled the sun, but the lower edge of it was partly lost on\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was the first time that these mock suns had been seen by\r\nGregory and some others of the crew of the _Hope_, little attention was\r\npaid to them at the time, because of the dangerous position into which\r\nthe brig had been forced.  The pack had again closed all around her,\r\nobliging her to take shelter in the lee of a small berg, which, from its\r\nshape, did not seem likely to be a dangerous protector.\r\n\r\nThere was a small bay in the berg.  Into this the brig was warped, and\r\nfor some time she lay safely here.  It was just large enough to hold\r\nher, and a long tongue of ice, projecting from the foot of it, kept off\r\nthe pressure of the sea-ice.  Nevertheless a look of anxiety rested on\r\nthe captain's face after the ice-anchors had been made fast.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to like our position, captain,\" said young Gregory, who\r\nhad been watching the doings of the men and now and then lent them a\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I don't, Tom.  The pack is closing tight up, and this berg may prove an\r\nenemy instead of a friend, if it forces into our harbour here.  Let us\r\nhear what our mate thinks of it.  What say you, Mr Mansell, shall we\r\nhold on here, or warp out and take our chance in the pack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better hold on, sir,\" answered the mate gravely.  \"The pack is\r\nbeginning to grind; we should get a tight embrace, I fear, if we went\r\nout.  Here we may do well enough; but everything depends on that\r\ntongue.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked as he spoke toward the point of ice which extended in front of\r\nthe brig's stern, and guarded the harbour from the outer ice in that\r\ndirection.  The tongue was not a large one, and it was doubtful whether\r\nit could stand the pressure that was increasing every minute.\r\n\r\nThe pack was indeed beginning to \"grind,\" as the mate had said, for,\r\nwhile they were looking at it, the edges of two floes came together with\r\na crash about fifty yards from the berg.  They ground together for a\r\nmoment with a harsh growling sound, and then the two edges were suddenly\r\nforced up to a height of about fifteen or twenty feet.  Next moment they\r\nfell on the closed-up ice, and lay there in a mound, or _hummock_, of\r\nbroken masses.\r\n\r\n\"That's how a 'ummuck is formed, Dr Gregory,\" said Mr Dicey, looking\r\nuncommonly wise.  \"You'll see more things here in five minutes, by means\r\nof your own eyes, than ye could learn from books in a year.  There's\r\nnothin' like seein'.  Seein' is believin', you know.  I wouldn't give an\r\nounce of experience for a ton of hearsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Mr Dicey, don't run down book-learning,\" said Gregory.  \"If a\r\nman only knew about things that he had seen, he would know very little.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the second mate could reply the captain shouted to the men to\r\n\"Bear a hand with the ice-poles.\"  The whole crew answered to the call,\r\nand each man, seizing a long pole, stood ready for action.\r\n\r\nThe tongue to which I have referred more than once had broken off, and\r\nthe ice was rushing in.  The bay was full in a minute, and although the\r\nmen used their ice-poles actively, and worked with a will, they could\r\nnot shove the pieces past them.  The _Hope_ was driven bow on to the\r\nberg.  Then there was a strain, a terrible creaking and groaning of the\r\ntimbers, as if the good little vessel were complaining of the pressure.\r\nAll at once there was a loud crack, the bow of the brig lifted a little,\r\nand she was forced violently up the sloping side of the berg.  Twice\r\nthis happened, and then she remained stationary--high and dry out of the\r\nwater!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nA GALE--NARROW ESCAPES--SIGNS OF WINTER--SET FAST.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of that day and the whole of that night did the brig\r\nremain fixed on the berg.  Early next morning the ice began to move.  It\r\neased off, and the vessel slid gently down the slope on which she had\r\nbeen forced, and was re-launched safely into the water.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of the crew, on being thus delivered from a position of\r\nmuch danger, was very great; but they had no sooner escaped from one\r\nperil than they were overtaken by another.  A sharp breeze sprang up\r\nfrom the eastward, and drove them out into the pack, which began to\r\nheave about in a terrible manner under the influence of the wind.  Soon\r\nthis increased to a gale, and the ice was driven along at great speed by\r\na strong northerly current.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, land was discovered bearing to the northeast.\r\nHere was new danger, for although it was not a lee-shore, still there\r\nwas some risk of the vessel being caught among grounded ice-bergs--of\r\nwhich a few were seen.\r\n\r\nThe gale increased to such a degree before night that Captain Harvey\r\nbegan to think of taking shelter under the lee of one of these bergs.\r\nHe therefore stood toward one, but before reaching it the vessel\r\nreceived one or two severe shocks from passing floes.  A large berg lay\r\nwithin half a mile of them.  They reached it in safety, and getting\r\nunder its lee, lowered a boat and fixed their ice-anchors.  Just after\r\nthey were fixed, a mass of ice, the size of a ship's long-boat and many\r\ntons in weight, came suddenly up out of the sea with great violence, the\r\ntop of it rising above the bulwarks.  One corner of it struck the hull\r\njust behind the mainmast, and nearly stove in the bottom of the brig.\r\n\r\nThis lump was what Arctic voyagers term a \"calf.\"  When masses of ice\r\nbreak off from the bergs far below the surface of the water, they rise\r\nwith extreme violence, and ships run great risk of being destroyed by\r\nthese calves when they anchor too near to the bergs.  Had this calf\r\nstruck the _Hope_ a fair blow she must certainly have gone down with all\r\non board.\r\n\r\nThey were not yet freed from their troubles, however.  In half an hour\r\nthe wind shifted a few points, but the stream of the loose ice did not\r\nchange.  The brig was, therefore, blown right in among the rushing\r\nmasses.  The three cables that held her were snapped as if they had been\r\npieces of packthread, and she was whirled out into the pack, where she\r\ndrove helplessly, exposed to the fury of the howling storm and the\r\ndangers of the grinding ice.  Captain Harvey now felt that he could do\r\nnothing to save his vessel.  He believed that if God did not mercifully\r\nput forth His hand to deliver them by a miracle, he and his companions\r\nwould certainly perish.  In this the captain was wrong.  Nothing is\r\nimpossible to the Almighty.  He can always accomplish his purposes\r\nwithout the aid of a miracle.\r\n\r\nThere did, indeed, seem no way of escape; for the driving masses of ice\r\nwere grinding each other to powder in nearly every direction, and the\r\nbrig only escaped instant destruction by being wedged between two pieces\r\nthat held together from some unknown cause.  Presently they were carried\r\ndown toward a large berg that seemed to be aground, for the loose ice\r\nwas passing it swiftly.  This was not the case, however.  An\r\nundercurrent, far down in the depths of the sea, was acting on this\r\nberg, and preventing it from travelling with the ice that floated with\r\nthe stream at the surface.  In its passing, the mass of ice that held\r\nthem struck one of the projecting tongues beneath the surface, and was\r\nsplit in two.  The brig was at once set free.  As they passed they might\r\nalmost have leaped upon the berg.  Captain Harvey saw and seized his\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to heave an anchor,\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nSam Baker, being the strongest man in the ship, sprang to one of the\r\nsmall ice-anchors that lay on the deck with a line attached to it, and,\r\nlifting it with both hands, stood ready.\r\n\r\nThe brig passed close to the end of the berg, where the lee-side formed\r\na long tail of sheltered water.  She was almost thrust into this by the\r\npiece of ice from which she had just escaped.  She grazed the edge of\r\nthe berg as she drove past.\r\n\r\n\"Heave!\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\nSam Baker swung the anchor round his head as if it had been a feather,\r\nand hurled it far upon the ice.  For a few yards it rattled over the\r\nslippery surface; then it caught a lump, but the first strain broke it\r\noff.  Just after that it fell into a crack and held on.  The brig was\r\nchecked, and swung round into the smooth water; but they had to ease off\r\nthe line lest it should snap.  At last she was brought up, and lay\r\nsafely under the shelter of that berg until the storm was over.\r\n\r\nSome weeks flew by after this without anything occurring worthy of\r\nparticular notice.  During this time the _Hope_ made good progress into\r\nthe Polar regions, without again suffering severely either from ice or\r\nstorm, although much retarded by the thick fogs that prevail in the\r\nArctic regions.  She was indeed almost always surrounded by ice, but it\r\nwas sufficiently open to allow of a free passage through it.  Many\r\nwhales and seals had been seen, also one or two bears, but not in\r\ncircumstances in which they could be attacked without occasioning much\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThe brief summer had now passed away, and the days began to shorten as\r\nwinter approached.  Still Captain Harvey hoped to get farther north\r\nbefore being obliged to search for winter quarters.  One morning early\r\nin September, however, he found to his sorrow that pancake-ice was\r\nforming on the sea.  When the sea begins to freeze it does so in small\r\nneedle-like spikes, which cross and recross each other until they form\r\nthin ice, which the motion of the waves breaks up into flat cakes about\r\na foot or so across.  These, by constantly rubbing against each other,\r\nget worn into a rounded shape.  Sailors call this \"pancake-ice.\"  It is\r\nthe first sign of coming winter.  The cakes soon become joined together\r\nas the frost increases.\r\n\r\nThe place where this occurred was near to those wild cliffs that rise\r\nout of the sea in the channels or straits that lie at the head of\r\nBaffin's Bay.  The vessel was now beyond the farthest point of land that\r\nhad been discovered at the time of which I am writing, and already one\r\nor two of the headlands had been named by Captain Harvey and marked on\r\nhis chart.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to see pancake-ice so early in the season,\" remarked the\r\ncaptain to Mr Mansell.\r\n\r\n\"No more do I, sir,\" answered the mate.  \"This would be a bad place to\r\nwinter in, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Land ahead!\" was shouted at that moment by the look-out at the\r\nmasthead.\r\n\r\n\"Keep her away two points,\" said the captain to the man at the helm.\r\n\"How does it lie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ahead, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any ice near it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; all clear.\"\r\n\r\nThe brig was kept a little more out to sea.  Soon she came to more open\r\nwater, and in the course of four hours was close to the land, which\r\nproved to be a low, barren island, not more than a mile across.\r\n\r\nHere the wind died away altogether, and a sharp frost set in.  The\r\npancakes became joined together, and on the following morning, when our\r\nfriend Gregory came on deck, he found that the whole ocean was covered\r\nwith ice!  It did not, indeed, look very like ice, because, being so\r\nthin, it did not prevent the usual swell from rolling over the sea.  A\r\nlight breeze was blowing, and the brig cut her way through it for some\r\ntime; but the breeze soon died away, leaving her becalmed within a\r\nquarter of a mile of the island.\r\n\r\nFor some time the voyagers hoped that a thaw would take place, or that\r\nwind would break up the ice.  But they were disappointed.  This was the\r\nfirst touch of the cold hand of winter, and the last day of the _Hope's_\r\nadvance northward.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Captain Harvey set energetically to work to cut his way\r\ninto winter quarters, for it would not do to remain all winter in the\r\nexposed position in which his vessel then lay.  On his right was the\r\nisland, already referred to, about a quarter of a mile off.  Beyond\r\nthis, about five miles distant, were the high steep cliffs of the\r\nwestern coast of Greenland.  Everywhere else lay the open sea, covered\r\nhere and there with floes and bergs, and coated with new ice.\r\n\r\nThis ice became so thick in the course of another night that the men\r\ncould walk on it without danger.  By means of saws and chisels made for\r\nthe purpose, they cut a passage toward the island, and finally moored\r\nthe brig in a small bay which was sheltered on all sides except the\r\neast.  This, being the land side, required no protection.  They named\r\nthe place \"Refuge Harbour.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone was now full of activity.  The voyagers had reached the spot\r\nwhere they knew they were destined to spend the winter and much had to\r\nbe done before they could consider themselves in a fit state to face\r\nthat terrible season.\r\n\r\nWinter in the Polar regions extends over eight months of the year--from\r\nSeptember to May.  But so much of ice and snow remains there all the\r\nsummer that winter can scarcely be said to quit those regions at all.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine what the Arctic winter is.  We cannot\r\nproperly understand the tremendous difficulties and sufferings that men\r\nwho go to the Polar seas have to fight against.  Let the reader think of\r\nthe following facts, and see if he does not draw his chair closer to the\r\nfire and feel thankful that he has not been born an Eskimo, and is not\r\nan Arctic seaman!\r\n\r\nWinter within the Arctic circle, as I have said, is fully eight months\r\nlong.  During that time the land is covered with snow many feet deep,\r\nand the sea with ice of all degrees of thickness--from vast fields of\r\nten or fifteen feet thick to bergs the size of islands and mountains--\r\nall frozen into one solid mass.\r\n\r\nThere is no sunlight there, night or day, for three out of these eight\r\nwinter months, and there is not much during the remaining five.  In\r\nsummer there is perpetual sunlight, all night as well as all day, for\r\nabout two months--for many weeks the sun never descends below the\r\nhorizon.  It is seen every day and every night sweeping a complete\r\ncircle in the bright blue sky.  Having been so free of his light in\r\nsummer, the sun seems to think he has a right to absent himself in\r\nwinter, for the three months of darkness that I have spoken of are not\r\nmonths of _partial_ but of _total_ darkness--as far, at least, as the\r\nsun is concerned.  The moon and stars and the \"Northern Lights\" do,\r\nindeed, give their light when the fogs and clouds will allow them; but\r\nno one will say that these make up for the absence of the sun.\r\n\r\nThen the frost is so intense that everything freezes solid except pure\r\nspirits of wine.  Unless you have studied the thermometer you cannot\r\nunderstand the intensity of this frost; but for the sake of those who do\r\nknow something about extreme cold, I give here a few facts that were\r\nnoted down during the winter that my story tells of.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September these ice-bound voyagers had eighteen degrees\r\nof frost, and the darkness had advanced on them so rapidly that it was\r\ndark about ten at night.  By the 1st of October the ice round the brig\r\nwas a foot and a half thick.  Up to this time they had shot white hares\r\non the island, and the hunting parties that crossed the ice to the\r\nmainland shot deer and musk oxen, and caught white foxes in traps.\r\nGulls and other birds, too, had continued to fly around them; but most\r\nof these went away to seek warmer regions farther south.  Walrus and\r\nseals did not leave so soon.  They remained as long as there was any\r\nopen water out at sea.  The last birds that left them, (and the first\r\nthat returned in spring) were the \"snow-birds\"--little creatures about\r\nthe size of a sparrow, almost white, with a few brown feathers here and\r\nthere.  The last of these fled from the darkening winter on the 7th of\r\nNovember, and did not return until the 1st of the following May.  When\r\nthey left it was dark almost all day.  The thermometer could scarcely be\r\nread at noon, and the stars were visible during the day.  From this time\r\nforward thick darkness set in, and the cold became intense.  The\r\nthermometer fell _below_ zero, and after that they never saw it _above_\r\nthat point for months together--20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees\r\nbelow were common temperatures.  The ice around them was ten feet thick.\r\nOn the 1st of December noon was so dark that they could not see fifty\r\nyards ahead, and on the 15th the fingers could not be counted a foot\r\nfrom the eyes.  The thermometer stood at 40 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nThe darkness could not now become greater, but the cold still continued\r\nto grow more intense.  It almost doubled in severity.  In January it\r\nfell to 67 degrees below zero!  So great was this cold that the men felt\r\nimpelled to breathe gradually.  The breath issued from their mouths in\r\nwhite clouds of steam and instantly settled on their beards and whiskers\r\nin hoar-frost.  In the cabin of the _Hope_ they had the utmost\r\ndifficulty in keeping themselves moderately warm at this time.\r\n\r\nThings had now reached their worst, and by slow degrees matters began to\r\nmend.  On the 22nd of January the first faint sign of returning day\r\nappeared--just a blue glimmer on the horizon.  By the middle of February\r\nthe light tipped the tops of the mountains on shore, and the highest\r\npeaks of the ice-bergs on the sea, and on the 1st of March it bathed the\r\ndeck of the _Hope_.  Then the long-imprisoned crew began to feel that\r\nspring was really coming.  But there was little heat in the sun's rays\r\nat first, and it was not till the month of May that the ice out at sea\r\nbroke up and summer could be said to have begun.\r\n\r\nDuring all this long winter--during all these wonderful changes, our\r\nArctic voyagers had a hard fight in order to keep themselves alive.\r\nTheir life was a constant struggle.  They had to fight the bears and the\r\nwalrus; to resist the cold and the darkness; to guard against treachery\r\nfrom the natives; and to suffer pains, sickness, and trials, such as\r\nseldom fall to the lot of men in ordinary climates.\r\n\r\nHow they did and suffered all this I shall try to show in the following\r\npages.  In attempting this I shall make occasional extracts from the\r\njournal of our friend Tom Gregory, for Tom kept his journal regularly,\r\nand was careful to note down only what he heard and saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR WINTERING--REMARKABLE ADVENTURES WITH A BEAR.\r\n\r\nThe first care of Captain Harvey, after getting his brig securely laid\r\nup in her icy cradle for the winter was to remove some of the stores to\r\nthe island, where he had them carefully secured in a little hut which\r\nthe crew built of loose stones.  This relieved the strain on the vessel,\r\nand permitted the free circulation of air.  The fitting up of the\r\ninterior of the brig was then begun.\r\n\r\nThe wooden partition between the cabin and the hold was taken down, and\r\nthe whole space thrown into one apartment.  The stove was put up in the\r\ncentre of it, and moss was piled round the walls inside about a foot\r\nthick.  Moss was also spread on the deck, and above it the snow was\r\nallowed to gather, for snow, although so cold itself, keeps things that\r\nit covers warm, by not permitting the heat to escape.  The brig was\r\nbanked up all round with snow, and a regular snowy staircase was built\r\nfrom the ice to her bulwarks.\r\n\r\nThey changed their time, now, from what is called sea-time to that which\r\nwe follow on land.  That is to say, they reckoned the day to commence\r\njust after twelve, midnight, instead of dividing it into watches, as\r\nthey were wont to do at sea.  Journals were begun, and careful notes\r\nmade of everything that occurred, or that might in any way further the\r\nobject for which they had gone there.  Every man in the ship had his\r\nappointed duty and his post.  If the native Eskimos should arrive in a\r\nwarlike temper, each man had his cutlass and pistols in readiness.  If a\r\nbear should pay them a visit, each could lay hands on his musket in an\r\ninstant; and if a fire should break out on board, every man had his\r\nbucket ready and his particular post fixed.  Some were to run to the\r\nwater-hole, which it was the duty of one man to keep open.  Others were\r\nto station themselves from the hole to the ship to pass the buckets,\r\nwhile the rest were to remain on board to convey them to the point of\r\ndanger.  Captain Harvey fixed all the arrangements, and superintended\r\nthe carrying out of his orders in a general way, making his two officers\r\nand the young doctor responsible for the overseeing of details.  Each of\r\nthese foremen furnished him with a report every night of what had been\r\ndone during the day, and the result was noted down by himself in a\r\njournal.  Thus everything went smoothly and pleasantly along during the\r\nfirst weeks of their sojourn in their frozen home.\r\n\r\nIn regard to fresh provisions they were fortunate at first, for they\r\nobtained sufficient supplies of deer and other game.  This was in the\r\nearly part of winter, while there was still plenty of daylight.  In Tom\r\nGregory's journal I find it thus written:\r\n\r\n\"_September 10th_.--The days are beginning to shorten now, and we are\r\nall busily occupied in preparing for the long, dark winter that is\r\nbefore us.  Sam Baker, who is the best shot among us, brought in a deer\r\nto-day.  This is fortunate, for we stand in need of fresh meat.  Our\r\ngreatest enemy this winter, I fear, will be scurvy.  Unless we obtain a\r\nlarge supply of fresh provisions we cannot hope to escape it.  Crofts\r\nbrought in two Arctic hares.  They are beautiful creatures--pure white--\r\nand each weighs about seven pounds.  These, with the four deer shot by\r\nmyself last week and the ten hares got by Baker, will keep us going for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\n\"_September 12th_.--I had an adventure with a polar bear last night,\r\nwhich has amused the men very much, and given them food for jocularity\r\nfor a few days.  Some days back Davy Butts set a trap on the island, in\r\nwhich he has caught a few foxes.  Last night his long legs were so tired\r\nthat he did not care to visit his trap, so I offered to go instead of\r\nhim.  It was while I was out on this errand that I happened to meet with\r\nbruin.  Our meeting was sudden and unexpected on both sides, I believe.\r\nIt was midnight when I set off to the trap, which was not more than half\r\na mile from the ship, and it was quite dark when I reached it.\r\n\r\n\"Davy is an ingenious fellow.  His trap is made of four blocks of hard\r\nsnow, with a sort of wooden trigger that goes off the moment the bait is\r\ntouched, and allows a heavy log to fall down on the poor fox's back.\r\nThere was no fox there, however, when I reached it.  I went down on my\r\nknees and was examining the bait, when I heard a low growl.  I leaped\r\nup, and felt for the knife which I usually carried in my belt.  It was\r\nnot there!  In the haste of my departure from the ship I had forgotten\r\nto buckle it on.  I had no gun, of course.  It was too dark to shoot,\r\nand I had not counted on meeting with any dangerous enemy.  I could only\r\ncrouch down behind a lump of ice and hope that the bear would go away,\r\nbut another growl, much louder than the first, and close at hand, showed\r\nthat I had been seen.  It was so dark that I could hardly see fifty\r\nyards ahead.  There was a great chasm or hole just in front of me.  This\r\nwas the place where the main body of the sea-ice had been separated from\r\nthe shore-ice that was aground.  Here every rise and fall of the tide\r\nhad broken it afresh, so that the rent was twenty yards wide, and full\r\nof large blocks that had been tossed about in confusion.  Across this I\r\ngazed into the gloom, and thought I saw an object that looked like a\r\nlarge block of rounded ice.  Before I could make up my mind how to act,\r\nthe block of ice rose up with a furious roar and charged me.  The chasm\r\nchecked him for a moment.  But for this I should have been caught\r\nimmediately.  While he was scrambling over it I took to my heels, and\r\nran along the edge of the ice at the top of my speed.\r\n\r\n\"There was a narrow part of the chasm which I had looked at in daylight,\r\nand wondered whether I might venture to leap across it.  I had made up\r\nmy mind that it was too wide and dangerous to be attempted.  But it is\r\nwonderful how quickly a man changes his mind on such a point when a\r\npolar bear is roaring at his heels.  I came to the gap in the ice.  It\r\nwas ten feet deep and thirteen or fourteen feet across.  The jagged\r\nlumps of ice at the bottom lay there in horrible confusion.  There was\r\nbarely light enough to see where the hole was when I came within ten\r\nyards of it, but I did not hesitate.  A rush! a bound! and I went over\r\nlike a cat.  Not so the bear.  He had not measured the place with his\r\neye in daylight, as I had done.  He made a gallant leap, it is true, but\r\nfell short, as I knew from the bursting sound and the growl of rage with\r\nwhich he came against the edge of the ice, and fell back among the\r\nbroken blocks.  I did not wait to see how he got out, you may be sure,\r\nbut ran as I never ran before in all my life!  I reached the brig quite\r\nout of breath.  The bear had not followed me up, for I did not see him\r\nthat night again.  Long Davy laughed at me a good deal, and said he was\r\nsure I had been frightened at a shadow.  It gave a wonderfully loud roar\r\nfor a shadow!  I hope that Davy himself may get a chase before the\r\nwinter is over, just to convince him of his error in not believing me!\"\r\n\r\nThe kind wish thus expressed in the young doctor's journal was gratified\r\nsooner than might have been expected.\r\n\r\nOnly two days after the incident above described, poor Davy Butts met\r\nwith the same bear, face to face, and had a run for his life, that\r\nturned the laugh from Tom Gregory to himself.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of a clear, cold day, just about sunset.  The\r\nmen had finished dinner and were smoking their pipes on deck, stamping\r\ntheir feet and slapping their hands and arms, to keep them warm.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Davy! where are you bound for?\" inquired the captain, on\r\nobserving that Butts was wrapping himself carefully in his fur-coat,\r\ntightening his belt, and putting on his mittens as if bent on a long\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"I'm only goin' to take a look at my fox-trap, sir, if you'll allow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my lad.  If you get a fox it's well worth the trouble.  And\r\nhark'ee, Davy, take your axe and make one or two more of these\r\nsnow-traps of yours.  It will be a well-spent hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Butts,\" exclaimed Gregory, \"what do you mean to do with that big\r\nhorse-pistol?  Surely you are not afraid of bears after laughing so much\r\nat the one that chased me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not _afraid_, you know,\" replied Davy.  \"But there's no harm in\r\nbeing armed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind you shoot him straight in the eye, or send a bullet up his nose.\r\nThem's the vulnerable parts of him,\" cried Joe Davis, with a laugh, as\r\nButts went down the snow-steps and got upon the ice.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" cried Pepper, as he was moving away.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring his tongue aboard with you, and I'll cook it for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, and a bit of fat to fry it in,\" added the steward.  \"There's\r\nnothin' like tongue fried in bear's grease.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Dawkins,\" said Mr Dicey.  \"Hallo!  Davy; bring the 'ams.\r\nBear's 'ams are considered fustrate heatin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, _don't_ bring the hams,\" shouted Jim Croft, \"fetch the tongue;\r\nthat's the thing for supper of a cold night--fetch the tongue, lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your own tongue,\" shouted Davy, in reply, as he went off amid the\r\nlaughter of his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank soon after, and before the ingenious seaman had finished\r\ntwo new traps the short twilight had gradually deepened into night.\r\nStill there was plenty of light, for the sky was clear, and studded with\r\na host of stars.  In addition to this the Aurora Borealis was sending\r\nits beautiful flashes of pale-green light all across the western sky.\r\n\r\nThe Aurora--which also goes by the names of \"Northern Lights,\" and\r\n\"Streamers,\" and \"Merry-dancers,\" is seen in great splendour in these\r\nnorthern skies.  When the seaman had finished his traps, and looked up\r\nfor a minute or two at the sky, before starting on his return to the\r\nship, he beheld the Aurora extending over the heavens in the form of an\r\nirregular arch.  It was extremely bright, but the brightness was not the\r\nsame in all parts.  It moved and waved gently about like a band of thin\r\ngreen fire.  Every now and then long tongues or streamers darted up from\r\nit, and these were brighter than the rest.  They were yellowish white,\r\nand sometimes became pale pink in colour.  The light from this beautiful\r\nobject was equal to that of the moon in her quarter, and the stars that\r\nwere behind it shone dimly through, as if they were covered with a thin\r\ngauze veil.\r\n\r\nWhile Davy was gazing in wonder at the splendid lights above him, a deep\r\ngrowl fell upon his ear.  If the man had been a Jack-in-the-box he could\r\nnot have leaped more quickly round.  His pistol was out and cocked in a\r\nmoment!\r\n\r\nThe growl was followed by a roar, which drove all the blood back into\r\nDavy's heart, and seemed to freeze it there--solid.\r\n\r\nThe man was no coward, as was quite clear, for at first he boldly stood\r\nhis ground.  But he would have been more than mortal if he had not felt\r\nsome strange qualms about his heart when he saw a large white bear\r\nrushing furiously toward him.  The animal came this time from the\r\ninterior of the small island.  The seaman knew well the place over which\r\nyoung Gregory had jumped when he had been chased.  After wavering for a\r\nmoment or two he turned and fled.  Another tremendous roar helped him\r\nover the ice like a deer, and he took the chasm with a bound like an\r\nIndia-rubber ball.\r\n\r\nIt must certainly have been the same animal that chased Gregory, for,\r\ninstead of trying to leap the chasm, it went to another part of the rent\r\nand scrambled across.  This gave Butts time to increase the distance\r\nbetween them, but a man is no match for a polar bear in a race.  The\r\nmonster was soon close up with him, and the ship still far off.  The man\r\nknew his danger; he turned, took a quick aim, and fired.  He missed, of\r\ncourse; flung the pistol in desperation in the bear's face, and ran on.\r\nThe pistol happened to stick in the snow, with the butt in the air, and\r\nwhen the bear came up to it he stopped to smell it!\r\n\r\nIt it well known, nowadays, that polar bears are full of curiosity, and\r\nwill stop for a few minutes to examine anything that comes in their way,\r\neven when they are in full chase of a man.  Davy Butts knew nothing of\r\nthis at the time; but he was a quick-witted fellow.  He observed this\r\nstopping of the bear, and determined to give him something more to stop\r\nat.\r\n\r\nWhen bruin was close at his heels he threw down his cap.  The bear at\r\nonce pulled up, smelt it all round, tossed it into the air with his\r\nsnout, pawed it once or twice, then tore it to pieces with one wrench,\r\nand continued the chase.  Very little time was lost in this operation.\r\nHe was soon up with the man again; then a mitten was thrown down for his\r\ninspection.  After that the other mitten went, the cravat followed, and\r\nthe axe went next.  All that I have just related happened in a very few\r\nminutes.  Davy was still a good quarter of a mile from the brig;\r\neverything that he could tear off his person in haste and throw down was\r\ngone, and the bear was once more coming up behind.  As a last hope he\r\npulled off his heavy fur-coat and dropped it.  This seemed to be a\r\nsubject of great interest to the bear, for it was longer in inspecting\r\nit than the other things.  And now poor Butts went tearing along like a\r\nmaniac, in his flannel shirt and trousers.  He was a miserable and\r\ncurious object, for his body, besides being very long, was uncommonly\r\nlanky, and his legs and arms seemed to go like the wings of a windmill.\r\nNever, since the day of his birth, had Davy Butts run at such a pace, in\r\nsuch light clothing, and in such severe frost!\r\n\r\nA long line of low hummocks hid him from the brig.  The moment he passed\r\nthese he came in sight of her and began to yell.\r\n\r\n\"Wot on airth is yon?\" exclaimed Joe Davis, who chanced to be looking\r\nover the gangway when this remarkable object appeared.\r\n\r\n\"The wild man o' the North himself, or my name aint Jim,\" said Crofts,\r\nturning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Davy Butts, I do believe,\" cried Sam Baker, who came on deck\r\nat that moment.\r\n\r\nJust then the bear came tearing round the end of the hummocks in full\r\nchase.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hallo! ho!\" roared the men, who had crowded on deck at the\r\nfirst note of alarm.\r\n\r\nSam Baker seized a heavy ash handspike about five feet long, and was on\r\nhis way to meet his comrade before the others had gained the ice.  They\r\nwere not slow, however.  Some with muskets, some with pistols and\r\ncutlasses, and some with nothing but their fists--all followed Sam, who\r\nwas now far ahead.\r\n\r\nBaker passed Davy without a remark, and ran straight at the bear, which\r\nstopped on seeing such a big, powerful man running so furiously at him,\r\nand flourishing a bludgeon that would almost have suited the hand of a\r\ngiant.  But polar bears are not timid.  He rose on his hind legs at\r\nonce, and paid no attention whatever to the tremendous crack that Sam\r\ndealt him over the skull.  The blow broke the handspike in two, and the\r\nfool-hardy seaman would soon have paid for his rashness with his life\r\nhad not friendly and steady hands been near.  Nothing daunted, he was\r\nabout to repeat the blow with the piece of the handspike that was still\r\nin his grasp, and the bear was about to seize him with its claws, each\r\nof which were full two inches long, when the first mate and Gregory came\r\nrunning toward him, side by side, the first armed with a rifle, the\r\ndoctor with pistols.\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" gasped Gregory.\r\n\r\n\"We must fire,\" said Mansell, \"and risk hitting Sam.  Here, doctor, you\r\nare a good shot; take the rifle.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man obeyed, dropped on one knee, and took aim, but did not\r\nfire.  Sam was between him and the bear.  A sudden movement changed\r\ntheir positions.  The side of the monster came into view, and in another\r\ninstant it was stretched on the ice with a bullet in his brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA GREAT BATTLE WITH THE WALRUS.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that there was a jovial feast that night at\r\nsupper.  The bear's tongue was cooked after all, but the impudent\r\ntongues of the party were not silenced, for they almost worried the life\r\nout of poor Davy for having run away from a bear.\r\n\r\nSoon after this event the preparations for spending the winter were\r\ncompleted; at least as far as the fitting up of the vessel was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\"This morning,\" writes Gregory, in his journal, \"we finished housing\r\nover our Arctic home.  The _Hope_ is very snug, lined with moss, and\r\nalmost covered with snow.  A sail has been spread over the quarter-deck\r\nlike an awning; it is also covered with moss and snow.  This, we hope,\r\nwill give much additional warmth to our house below.  We all live\r\ntogether now, men and officers.  It will require our united strength to\r\nfight successfully against that terrible enemy, John Frost.  John is\r\nking of the Arctic regions, undoubtedly!\r\n\r\n\"Dawkins got a cold-bath yesterday that amused the men much and did him\r\nno harm.  For some time past we have been carrying moss from the island\r\nin large bundles.  Dawkins got leave to help, as he said he was\r\nsick-tired of always working among stores.  He was passing close to the\r\nfire-hole with a great bundle of moss on his back, when his foot\r\nslipped, and down he went.  This hole is kept constantly open.  It is\r\nBaker's duty night and morning to break the ice and have it ready in\r\ncase of fire.  The ice on the surface was therefore thin; in a moment\r\nnothing was to be seen of poor Dawkins but his bundle!  Fortunately he\r\nheld tight on to it, and we hauled him out, soaked to the skin.  The\r\nthermometer stood at 35 degrees below zero, the coldest day we have had\r\nup to this time; and in two minutes the unfortunate man's clothes were\r\nfrozen so stiff that he could scarcely walk!  We had to break the ice on\r\nhis legs and arms at the joints, and even then he had to be half hoisted\r\non board and carried below.  We all dress in seal-skin and fox-skin\r\ngarments now.  Dawkins had on a rough coat, made of white and grey\r\nfoxes; trousers of the same; boots of seal-skin, and mittens ditto.\r\nWhen all this was soaked and frozen he was truly a humbling sight!\r\n\r\n\"The undressing of him was a labour of difficulty as well as of love.\r\nHowever, when he was rubbed dry, and re-clothed, he was none the worse.\r\nIndeed, I am inclined to think he was much the better of his ducking.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we are to make some curious experiments with boats, sledges,\r\nand kites.  The captain is anxious to take our largest boat over the ice\r\nas far to the south as possible, and leave her there with a quantity of\r\nprovisions, so that we may have her to fall back upon if any misfortune\r\nshould befall the brig, which I earnestly pray that God may forbid.\r\n\r\n\"Davy Butts, who is an ingenious fellow in his way, says that we can\r\nsail a boat on the ice almost as well as on the water, and that we may\r\ndrag sledges by means of kites, if we choose.  The captain means to\r\nattempt a journey to the north with sledges in spring, so, if the kites\r\nanswer, Butts will have done us good service.  But I have my doubts.\r\n\r\n\"The nights are closing in fast; very soon we shall be without the sun\r\naltogether.  But the moon is cheering us.  Last night, (28th October)\r\nshe swept in a complete circle round the sky _all day_ as well as all\r\nnight.  She only touched the horizon, and then, instead of setting, she\r\nrose again, as if the frozen sea had frightened her.\r\n\r\n\"_October 30th_.--Baker came in to-day and reported open water about six\r\nmiles off, and walrus sporting in it.  I shall set out to-morrow on a\r\nhunt.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunt which the young doctor here wrote of came off the following\r\nday, but it was a very different one from what any of the men had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, Baker, Davy Butts, and Gregory set off on foot,\r\narmed with a rifle and two muskets, besides a couple of harpoons, a\r\nwhale-lance, and a long line.  They also took a small sledge, which was\r\nintended to be used in hauling home the meat if they should be\r\nsuccessful.  Three hours' hard walking brought the party to the edge of\r\nthe solid ice, after which they travelled on the floes that were being\r\nconstantly broken by the tides, and were only joined together by ice of\r\na night or two old.  This was little more than an inch thick, so they\r\nhad to advance with caution.\r\n\r\nPresently the loud mooing of a bull walrus was heard.  Its roar was\r\nsomething between the lowing of a bull and the bark of a large dog, but\r\nmuch louder, for the walrus resembles an elephant in size more than any\r\nother animal.  Soon after they came in sight of their game.  Five walrus\r\nwere snorting and barking in a hole which they had broken in the ice.\r\nThe way in which this huge monster opens a hole when he wants to get out\r\nof the sea is to come up from below with considerable violence and send\r\nhis head crashing through the ice.\r\n\r\nThe three men now became very wary.  They crept on their hands and knees\r\nbehind the ice-hummocks until within about a hundred yards of the\r\nbrutes.  Then they ascended a small hummock to take a look round and\r\ndecide on their plan of operations.  While lying there, flat on their\r\nfaces, they took particular care to keep their heads well concealed,\r\njust raising them high enough to observe the position of the walrus.\r\nThere was a sheet of flat ice between them and the hole, so that it was\r\nimpossible to advance nearer without being seen.  This perplexed them\r\nmuch, for although their bullets might hit at that distance, they would\r\nnot be able to run in quick enough to use their lances, and the harpoons\r\nwould be of no use at all.\r\n\r\nWhile thus undecided what to do, they were unexpectedly taught a lesson\r\nin walrus-hunting that surprised them not a little.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! there's a bear!\" whispered Davy Butts, as a hairy object crawled\r\nout from behind an ice-hummock about two hundred yards from the place\r\nwhere they lay, and made toward the walrus in a sly, cat-like manner.\r\n\r\n\"More like a seal,\" observed Baker.\r\n\r\n\"A seal! why, it's a _man_!\" said Gregory, in a low, excited whisper.\r\n\r\n\"So it is, sure enough,\" said Baker; \"it must be an Eskimo, though his\r\nhairy garments make him look more like a bear than a man, and as the\r\nfellow has got here before us, I suppose we must give up our claim to\r\nthe brutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time enough to talk of that when the brutes are killed,\" said Gregory\r\nwith a smile.  \"But lie still, lads.  We will take a lesson from this\r\nfellow, who has been so earnestly staring at the walrus that he has not\r\nnoticed us.\"\r\n\r\nThe three men lay perfectly motionless watching the native, who crept as\r\nnear to the hole as he could without being seen, and then waited for a\r\nfew minutes until the creatures should dive.  This they were constantly\r\ndoing; staying down a few moments at a time, and then coming up to\r\nbreathe--for the walrus cannot live without air.  He is not a fish, and\r\nalthough he can stay down a long time, he _must_ come to the surface\r\noccasionally to breathe.  In this he resembles the seal and the whale.\r\n\r\nPresently, down they all went with a tremendous splash.  Now was the\r\nmoment! the Eskimo rose, ran at full speed for a few yards, then fell\r\nflat on his face, and lay quite still as if he had been shot dead.  The\r\nreason of this was soon apparent.  He understood the habits of the\r\nwalrus, and knew that they would rise again.  This they did almost the\r\nmoment after, and began their snorting, bellowing, and rolling again.\r\nOnce more they dived.  Up got the Eskimo, ran a few yards further\r\nforward, and then fell flat down as before.  In this way he got near to\r\nthe hole without being seen.\r\n\r\nThe watchers observed that he carried a harpoon and a coil of thick\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe next time the walrus dived he ran to the edge of the hole, but now,\r\ninstead of falling down, he stood quite still with the harpoon raised\r\nabove his head ready to be thrown.  In a few moments the monsters\r\nreappeared.  Two rose close at the edge of the hole; one was a male, the\r\nother a female.  They were frightfully ugly to look at.  Shaking the\r\nwater from his head and shoulders, the bull at once caught sight of the\r\nman who had thus suddenly appeared.  At that instant the Eskimo threw up\r\nhis left arm.  This action, instead of frightening the brutes away,\r\ncaused them to raise themselves high out of the water, in order to have\r\na good look at the strange creature who had thus dared to disturb them\r\nin their watery home.  This was just what the native wanted.  It gave\r\nhim a chance of driving the harpoon under the flipper of the male.  The\r\ninstant this was done he caught up the end of his coil and ran quickly\r\nback to the full length of the line.\r\n\r\nThe battle that now begun was perhaps one of the fiercest that was ever\r\nfought in the Arctic regions.  The walrus lashed the water furiously for\r\na second or two and dived.  This checked the native, who at once stopped\r\nrunning, drove the sharp point of a little piece of wood into the ice,\r\nand put the loop at the end of his line over it.  He pressed the loop\r\nclose down to the ice with his feet, so that he could hold on when it\r\ntightened, which it did with great force.  But the line was a stout one.\r\nIt had been cut from the hide of a walrus, and prepared in a peculiar\r\nway for the purpose of standing a heavy strain.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo now played the monster as an angler plays a trout.  At one\r\nmoment he held on, the next he eased off.  The line was sometimes like a\r\nbar of iron, then it was slackened off as the animal rose and darted\r\nabout.  After this had happened once or twice the bull came to the\r\nsurface, blowing tremendously, and began to bark and roar in great fury.\r\nThe female came up at the same time.  She evidently meant to stick by\r\nher partner and share his danger.  The others had dived and made off at\r\nthe first sign of war.\r\n\r\nThe wounded walrus was a little flurried and very angry; the female was\r\nnot at all frightened, she was passionately furious!  Both of them tore\r\nup the ice tables with their great ivory tusks, and glared at their\r\nenemy with an expression that there was no mistaking.  The walrus is\r\nwell known to be one of the fiercest animals in the world.  Woe to the\r\npoor native if he had been caught by these monsters at that time.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes spent in uselessly smashing the ice and trying to get\r\nat the native, they both dived.  Now came into play the Eskimo's\r\nknowledge of the animal's habits and his skill in this curious kind of\r\nwarfare.  Before diving they looked steadily at the man for a second,\r\nand then swam under the ice straight for the spot where he stood.  The\r\nEskimo of course could not see this, but he knew it from past\r\nexperience.  He therefore changed his position instantly; ran a few\r\nyards to one side, and planted his stick and loop again.  This had\r\nhardly been done when the ice burst up with a loud crash; a hole of more\r\nthan fifteen feet wide was made on the exact spot which the man had\r\nquitted, and the walrus appeared with a puff like that of a\r\nsteam-engine, and a roar that would have done credit to a lion.\r\n\r\nThe great lumpish-looking heads and square-cut faces of the creatures\r\nlooked frightful at this point in the fight.  There was something like\r\nhuman intelligence in their malicious and brutal faces, as the water\r\npoured down their cheeks and over their bristling beards, mingled with\r\nblood and foam.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a shout close at hand, and two other Eskimos\r\nran out from behind the ice-hummocks and joined their comrade.  They\r\nwere armed with long lances, the handles of which were made of bone, and\r\nthe points of beautiful white ivory tipped with steel.  It was\r\nafterwards discovered that these natives obtained small pieces of iron\r\nand steel from the Eskimos further south, who were in the habit of\r\ntrading at the settlements on the coast of Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe strangers at once ran to the edge of the pool and gave the bull\r\nwalrus two deep wounds with their lances.  They also wounded the female.\r\nThis seemed to render them more furious than ever.  They dived again.\r\nThe first Eskimo again shifted his position, and the others ran back a\r\nshort distance.  They were not a moment too soon in these changes, for\r\nthe ice was again burst upward at the spot they had just quitted, and\r\nthe enraged beasts once more came bellowing to the surface and vented\r\ntheir fury on the ice.\r\n\r\nIt may seem almost incredible to the reader, _but it is a fact_, that\r\nthis battle lasted fully four hours.  At the end of the third hour it\r\nseemed to the sailors who were watching it, that the result was still\r\ndoubtful, for the Eskimos were evidently becoming tired, while the\r\nmonsters of the Polar seas were still furious.\r\n\r\n\"I think we might help them with a butlet,\" whispered Baker.  \"It might\r\nfrighten them, perhaps, but it would save them a good deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a little longer,\" replied Gregory.  \"I have it in my mind to\r\nastonish them.  You see they have wounded the female very badly, but\r\nwhen the male dies, which he cannot now be long of doing, she will dive\r\nand make off, and so they'll lose her, for they don't seem to have\r\nanother harpoon and line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they have one behind the hummocks,\" suggested Davy Butts, whose\r\nteeth were chattering in his head with cold.\r\n\r\n\"If they had they would have used it long ago,\" said Gregory.  \"At any\r\nrate I mean to carry out my plan--which is this.  When the bull is about\r\ndead I will fire at the female and try to hit her in a deadly part, so\r\nas to kill her at once.  Then, Sam, you will run out with our harpoon\r\nand dart into her to prevent her sinking, or diving if she should not be\r\nkilled.  And you, Davy, will follow me and be ready with a musket.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan had just been settled when the bull walrus began to show signs\r\nof approaching death.  Gregory therefore took a deliberate aim with the\r\nrifle and fired.  The result was startling!  The female walrus began to\r\nroll and lash about furiously, smashing the ice and covering the sea\r\naround with bloody foam.  At first the Eskimos stood motionless--rooted\r\nto the spot, as if they had been thunderstruck.  But when they saw Sam\r\nBaker dart from behind the hummock, flourishing his harpoon, followed by\r\nGregory and Butts, their courage deserted them; they turned in terror\r\nand fled.\r\n\r\nOn getting behind the hummocks, however, they halted and peeped over the\r\nledges of ice to see what the seamen did.\r\n\r\nSam Baker, being an old whaleman, darted his harpoon cleverly, and held\r\nfast the struggling animal.  At the same time Davy Butts seized the end\r\nof the line which the natives had thrown down in terror, and held on to\r\nthe bull.  It was almost dead, and quite unable to show any more fight.\r\nSeeing that all was right, Gregory now laid down his rifle and advanced\r\nslowly to the hummock, behind which the Eskimos had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nHe knew, from the reports of previous travellers, that holding up both\r\narms is a sign of peace with the Eskimos.  He therefore stopped when\r\nwithin a short distance of the hummocks and held up his arms.  The\r\nsignal was understood at once.  The natives leaped upon the top of the\r\nhummock and held up their arms in reply.  Again Gregory tossed up his,\r\nand made signs to them to draw near.  This they did without hesitation,\r\nand the doctor shook them by the hand and patted their hairy shoulders.\r\nThey were all of them stout, well-made fellows, about five feet seven or\r\neight inches high, and very broad across the shoulders.  They were fat,\r\ntoo, and oily-faced, jolly-looking men.  They smiled and talked to each\r\nother for a few moments and then spoke to Gregory, but when he shook his\r\nhead, as much as to say, \"I don't understand you,\" they burst into a\r\nloud laugh.  Then they suddenly became grave, and ran at full speed\r\ntoward the hole where the walrus floated.\r\n\r\nDavy Butts made the usual sign of friendship and handed them the end of\r\ntheir line, which they seized, and set about securing their prize\r\nwithout taking any farther notice of their new friends.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these wild yet good-natured fellows hauled the\r\nenormous carcass out of the water was simple and ingenious.  They made\r\nfour cuts in the neck, about two inches apart from each other, and\r\nraised the skin between these cuts, thus making two bands.  Through one\r\nof these bands they passed a line, and carried it to a stick made fast\r\nin the ice, where they passed it through a loop of well-greased hide.\r\nIt was then carried back to the animal, made to pass under the second\r\nband, and the end was hauled in by the Eskimos.  This formed a sort of\r\ndouble purchase, that enabled them to pull out of the hole a carcass\r\nwhich double their numbers could not have hauled up.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the bull's weight may be formed when I say that the carcass\r\nwas eighteen feet long and eleven feet in circumference at the thickest\r\npart.  There were no fewer than sixty deep lance-wounds in various parts\r\nof its body.\r\n\r\nWhen seen close at hand the walrus is a very ugly monster.  It is\r\nsomething like a gigantic seal, having two large flippers, or fins, near\r\nits shoulders, and two others behind, that look like its tail.  It uses\r\nthese in swimming, but can also use them on land, so as to crawl, or\r\nrather to bounce forward in a clumsy fashion.  By means of its\r\nfore-flippers it can raise itself high out of the water, and get upon\r\nthe ice and rocks.  It is fond of doing this, and is often found\r\nsleeping in the sunshine on the ice and on rocks.  It has even been\r\nknown to scramble up the side of an island to a height of a hundred\r\nfeet, and there lie basking in the sun.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the water is the proper element of the walrus.  All its\r\nmotions are clumsy and slow until it gets into the sea; there it is \"at\r\nhome.\"  Its upper face has a square, bluff look, and its broad muzzle\r\nand cheeks are covered by a coarse beard of bristles, like quills.  The\r\ntwo white tusks point downward.  In this they are unlike to those of the\r\nelephant.  The tusks of the bull killed on this occasion were thirty\r\ninches long.  The hide of the walrus is nearly an inch thick, and is\r\ncovered with close, short hair.  Beneath the skin he has a thick layer\r\nof fat, and this enables him to resist the extreme cold in the midst of\r\nwhich he dwells.\r\n\r\nThe walrus is of great value to the Eskimos.  But for it and the seal\r\nthese poor members of the human family could not exist at all in those\r\nfrozen regions.  As it is, it costs them a severe struggle to keep the\r\nlife in their bodies.  But they do not complain of what seems to us a\r\nhard lot.  They have been born to it.  They know no happier condition of\r\nlife.  They wish for no better home, and the All-wise Creator has fitted\r\nthem admirably, both in mind and body, to live and even to enjoy life in\r\na region where most other men could live only in great discomfort, if\r\nthey could exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos cut the walrus' thick hide into long lines with which they\r\nhunt--as we have seen.  They do not cut these lines in strips and join\r\nthem in many places; but, beginning at one end of the skin, they cut\r\nround and round without break to the centre, and thus secure a line of\r\nmany fathoms in length.\r\n\r\nIt is truly said that \"necessity is the mother of invention.\"  These\r\nnatives have no wood.  Not a single tree grows in the whole land of\r\nwhich I am writing.  There are plenty of plants, grasses, mosses, and\r\nbeautiful flowers in summer--growing, too, close beside ice-fields that\r\nremain unmelted all the year round.  But there is not a tree large\r\nenough to make a harpoon of.  Consequently the Eskimos are obliged to\r\nmake sledges of bones; and as the bones and tusks of the walrus are not\r\nbig enough for this purpose, they tie and piece them together in a\r\nremarkably neat and ingenious manner.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, they find pieces of drift-wood in the sea.  Wrecks of\r\nwhale-ships, too, are occasionally found by the natives in the south of\r\nGreenland.  A few pieces of the precious wood obtained in this way are\r\nexchanged from one tribe to another, and so find their way north.  But\r\nthe further north we go the fewer pieces of this kind of wood do we\r\nfind; and in the far north, where our adventurous voyagers were now\r\nice-bound, the Eskimos have very little wood, indeed.\r\n\r\nFood is the chief object which the Eskimo has in view when he goes out\r\nto do battle with the walrus.  Its flesh is somewhat coarse, no doubt,\r\nbut it is excellent, nourishing food notwithstanding, and although a\r\nwell-fed Englishman might turn up his nose at it, many starving\r\nEnglishmen have smacked their lips over walrus-beef in days gone by--\r\naye, and have eaten it raw, too, with much delight!\r\n\r\nLet not my reader doubt the truth of this.  Well-known and truth-loving\r\nmen have dwelt for a time in those regions, and some of these have said\r\nthat they actually came to _prefer_ the walrus flesh raw, because it was\r\nmore strengthening, and fitted them better for undertaking long and\r\ntrying journeys in extremely cold weather.  One of the most gallant men\r\nwho ever went to the Polar seas, (Dr Kane, of the American navy), tells\r\nus, in his delightful book, \"Arctic Explorations\", that he frequently\r\nate raw flesh and liked it, and that the Eskimos often eat it raw.  In\r\nfact, they are not particular.  They will eat it cooked or raw--just as\r\nhappens to be most convenient for them.\r\n\r\nWhen the animals, whose killing I have described, were secured, the\r\nEskimos proceeded to skin and cut them up.  The sailors, of course,\r\nassisted, and learned a lesson.  While this was going on one of their\r\nnumber went away for a short time, and soon returned with a sledge drawn\r\nby about a dozen dogs.  This they loaded with the meat and hide of the\r\nbull, intending evidently to leave the cow to their new friends, as\r\nbeing their property.  But Gregory thought they were entitled to a share\r\nof it, so, after loading his sledge with a considerable portion of the\r\nmeat, he gave them the remainder along with the hide.\r\n\r\nThis pleased them mightily, and caused them to talk much, though to\r\nlittle purpose.  However, Gregory made good use of the language of\r\nsigns.  He also delighted them with the gift of a brass ring, an old\r\nknife, and a broken pencil-case, and made them understand that his abode\r\nwas not far distant, by drawing the figure of a walrus in a hole in the\r\nsnow, and then a thing like a bee-hive at some distance from it,\r\npointing northward at the same time.  He struck a harpoon into the\r\noutline of the walrus, to show that it was the animal that had just been\r\nkilled, and then went and lay down in the picture of the bee-hive, to\r\nshow that he dwelt there.\r\n\r\nThe natives understood this quite well.  They immediately drew another\r\nbee-hive, pointed to the south and to the sun, and held up five fingers.\r\nFrom this it was understood that their village was five days distant\r\nfrom the spot where they then were.\r\n\r\nHe next endeavored to purchase three of their dogs, but they objected to\r\nthis, and refused to accept of three knives as a price for them.  They\r\nwere tempted, however, by the offer of a whale harpoon and a hemp line,\r\nand at last agreed to let him have three of their best dogs.  This the\r\nyoung doctor considered a piece of great good fortune, and being afraid\r\nthat they would repent, he prepared to leave the place at once.  The\r\ndogs were fastened by lines to the sledge of their new masters.  A whip\r\nwas made out of a strip of walrus hide, a bone served for a handle, and\r\naway they went for the brig at a rattling pace, after bidding the\r\nnatives farewell, and making them understand that they hoped to meet\r\nagain in the course of the winter.\r\n\r\nThus happily ended their first meeting with the Eskimos.  It may well be\r\nbelieved that there were both astonishment and satisfaction on board the\r\n_Hope_ that night, when the hunting party returned, much sooner than had\r\nbeen expected, with the whip cracking, the men cheering, the dogs\r\nhowling, and the sledge well laden with fresh meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF ICE-BERGS--FOX-CHASE--A BEAR.\r\n\r\nOne day, long after the walrus-hunt just described, Joe Davis stood on\r\nthe deck of the _Hope_, leaning over the side and looking out to sea--at\r\nleast in the direction of the sea, for, although mid-day, it was so dark\r\nthat he could not see very far in any direction.  Joe was conversing\r\nwith Mr Dicey on the appearance of things around him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Mr Dicey,\" said he, \"wot it is as causes them there\r\nice-bergs?\"\r\n\r\nMr Dicey looked very grave and wise for a few seconds without\r\nanswering.  Then he said, in rather a solemn tone, \"Well, Davis, to tell\r\nyou the real truth, I _don't_ know!\"\r\n\r\nNow, as this question is one of considerable interest, I shall endeavour\r\nto answer it for the benefit of the reader.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the interior of Greenland is covered with ice and snow.\r\nThis snowy covering does not resemble that soft snow which falls on our\r\nown hills.  It is hard, and _never_ melts entirely away.  The snow there\r\nis in some places a thousand feet thick!  It covers all the hill-tops\r\nand fills up all the valleys, so that the country may be said to be a\r\nburied land.  Since the world began, perhaps, snow has been falling on\r\nit every winter; but the summers there have been so short that they\r\ncould not melt away the snow of one winter before that of another came\r\nand covered it up and pressed it down.  Thus, for ages, the snow of one\r\nyear has been added to that which was left of the preceding, and the\r\npressure has been so great that the mass has been squeezed nearly as\r\nhard as pure ice.\r\n\r\nThe ice that has been formed in this way is called _glacier_; and the\r\nglaciers of Greenland cover, as I have said, the whole country, so that\r\nit can never be cultivated or inhabited by man unless the climate\r\nchange.  There are glaciers of this kind in many other parts of the\r\nworld.  We have them in Switzerland and in Norway, but not on nearly so\r\nlarge a scale as in Greenland.\r\n\r\nNow, although this glacier-ice is clear and hard, it is not quite so\r\nsolid as pure ice, and when it is pushed down into the valleys by the\r\nincreasing masses above it, actually _flows_.  But this flowing motion\r\ncannot be seen.  It is like the motion of the hour hand of a watch,\r\nwhich cannot be perceived however closely it may be looked at.  You\r\nmight go to one of the valleys of Greenland and gaze at a glacier for\r\ndays together, but you would see no motion whatever.  All would appear\r\nsolid, frozen up, and still.  But notice a block of stone lying on the\r\nsurface of the glacier, and go back many months after and you will find\r\nthe stone lying a little further down the valley than when you first saw\r\nit.  Thus glaciers are formed and thus they slowly move.  But what has\r\nall this to do with ice-bergs?  We shall see.\r\n\r\nAs the great glaciers of the north, then, are continually moving down\r\nthe valleys, of course their ends are pushed into the sea.  These ends,\r\nor tongues, are often hundreds of feet thick.  In some places they\r\npresent a clear glittering wall to the sea of several hundreds of feet\r\nin height, with perhaps as much again lost to view down in the deep\r\nwater.  As the extremities of these tongues are shoved farther and\r\nfarther out they chip off and float away.  _These chips are ice-bergs_!\r\nI have already said that ice-bergs are sometimes miles in extent--like\r\nislands; that they sink seven or eight hundred feet below the surface,\r\nwhile their tops rise more than a hundred feet above it--like mountains.\r\nIf these, then, are the \"chips\" of the Greenland glaciers, what must\r\nthe \"old blocks\" be?\r\n\r\nMany a long and animated discussion the sailors had that winter in the\r\ncabin of the _Hope_ on the subject of ice and ice-bergs!\r\n\r\nWhen the dark nights drew on, little or nothing could be done outside by\r\nour voyagers, and when the ice everywhere closed up, all the animals\r\nforsook them except polar bears, so that they ran short of fresh\r\nprovisions.  As months of dreary darkness passed away, the scurvy, that\r\nterrible disease, began to show itself among the men, their bodies\r\nbecame less able to withstand the cold, and it was difficult for them at\r\nlast to keep up their spirits.  But they fought against their troubles\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\nCaptain Harvey knew well that when a man's spirits go he is not worth\r\nmuch.  He therefore did his utmost to cheer and enliven those around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne day, for instance, he went on deck to breathe a mouthful of fresh\r\nair.  It was about eleven in the forenoon, and the moon was shining\r\nbrightly in the clear sky.  The stars, too, and the aurora borealis,\r\nhelped to make up for the total absence of the sun.  The cold air cut\r\nlike a knife against his face when he issued from the hatchway, and the\r\ncold nose of one of the dogs immediately touched his hand, as the animal\r\ngambolled round him with delight; for the extreme severity of the\r\nweather began to tell on the poor dogs, and made them draw more lovingly\r\nto their human companions.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! hallo!\" shouted the captain down the hatchway.  \"A fox-chase! a\r\nfox-chase!  Tumble up, all hands!\"\r\n\r\nThe men were sitting at the time in a very dull and silent mood.  They\r\nwere much cast down, for as it had been cloudy weather for some weeks\r\npast, thick darkness had covered them night and day, so that they could\r\nnot tell the one from the other, except by the help of their watches,\r\nwhich were kept carefully going.  Their journals, also, were written up\r\ndaily, otherwise they must certainly have got confused in their time\r\naltogether!\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this darkness the men were confined almost entirely to\r\nthe cabin for a time.  Those who had scurvy, got worse; those who were\r\nwell, became gloomy.  Even Pepper, who was a tremendous joker, held his\r\ntongue, and Joe Davis, who was a great singer, became silent.  Jim\r\nCrofts was in his bunk \"down\" with the scurvy, and stout Sam Baker, who\r\nwas a capital teller of stories, could not pluck up spirit enough to\r\nopen his mouth.  \"In fact,\" as Mr Dicey said, \"they all had a most\r\n'orrible fit o' the blues!\"  The captain and officers were in better\r\nhealth and spirits than the men, though they all fared alike at the same\r\ntable, and did the same kind of work, whatever that might chance to be.\r\nThe officers, however, were constantly exerting themselves to cheer the\r\nmen, and I have no doubt that this very effort of theirs was the means\r\nof doing good to themselves.  \"He that watereth others shall be\r\nwatered,\" says the Word of God.  I take this to mean--he that does good\r\nto others shall get good to himself.  So it certainly was with the\r\nofficers of the _Hope_.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain's shout reached the cabin Jim Crofts had just said:\r\n\"I'll tell 'ee what it is, messmates, if this here state of things goes\r\non much longer, I'll go out on the floes, walk up to the first polar\r\nbear I meet, and ask him to take his supper off me!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no laugh at this, but Pepper remarked, in a quiet way, that\r\n\"he needn't put himself to so much trouble, for he was such a\r\npale-faced, disagreeable looking object that no bear would eat him\r\nunless it was starving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll offer myself to a starvin' bear--to one that's a'most\r\ndead with hunger,\" retorted Jim gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"What's that the cap'en is singin' out?\" said Davy Butts, who was\r\nmending a pair of canvas shoes.\r\n\r\nThe men roused themselves at once; for the hope of anything new turning\r\nup excited them.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! ho!\" roared the captain again, in a voice that might have\r\nstarted a dead walrus.  \"Tumble up, there!--a fox-chase!  I'll give my\r\nsecond-best fur-coat to the man that catches foxey!\"\r\n\r\nIn one instant the whole crew were scrambling up the ladder.  Even Jim\r\nCrofts, who was really ill, rolled out of his bunk and staggered on\r\ndeck, saying he would have a \"go after foxey if he should die for it!\"\r\n\r\nThe game of fox is simple.  One man is chosen to be the fox.  He runs\r\noff and the rest follow.  They are bound to go wherever the fox leads.\r\nIn this case it was arranged that the fox should run round the deck\r\nuntil he should be caught; then the man who caught him should become\r\nfox, and continue running on with all the rest following, until he, in\r\nturn, should be caught, and so on until the one who could run longest\r\nand fastest should break down all the rest.  The warm fur-coat was a\r\nprize worth running for in such a cold climate, so the game began with\r\nspirit.  Young Gregory offered to be fox first, and away they went with\r\na yell.  Mr Mansell was a little lame, and soon gave in.  Mr Dicey\r\nfell at the second round, and was unable to recover distance.  Gregory\r\nwould certainly have gained the coat, for he was strong, and had been a\r\ncrack racer at school; but he did not want the coat, so allowed Sam\r\nBaker to catch him.  Sam held on like a deer for a few minutes, and one\r\nafter another the men dropped off as they were blown.  Jim Crofts, poor\r\nfellow, made a gallant burst, but his limbs refused to help his spirit.\r\nHe fell, and was assisted below by the captain and replaced in his bunk,\r\nwhere, however, he felt the benefit of his efforts.\r\n\r\nThe race was now kept up by Sam Baker, Joe Davis, and Butts.  These\r\nthree were struggling on and panting loudly, while their comrades danced\r\nabout, clapped their mittened hands, and shouted, \"Now then, Sam!--go in\r\nand win, Joe!--Butts, forever!\" and such-like encouraging cries.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of everyone Davy Butts came off the winner, and for many\r\na day after that enjoyed the warm coat which he said his long legs had\r\ngained for him.\r\n\r\nThis effort of the captain to cheer the men was very successful, so he\r\nresolved to follow it up with an attempt at private theatricals.\r\nAccordingly this thing was proposed and heartily agreed to.  Next day\r\neveryone was busy making preparations.  Tom Gregory agreed to write a\r\nshort play.  Sam Baker, being the healthiest man on board, was willing\r\nto act the part of an invalid old lady, and Jim Crofts consented to\r\nbecome a gay young doctor for that occasion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the captain arranged a piece of real work, for he felt that\r\nthe attempt to keep up the spirits alone would not do.  They had been\r\nfor a long time living on salt provisions.  Nothing could restore the\r\ncrew but fresh meat--yet fresh meat was not to be had.  The walrus and\r\ndeer were gone, and although foxes and bears were still around them,\r\nthey had failed in all their attempts to shoot or trap any of these\r\nanimals.  A visit to the Eskimo camp, therefore, (if such a camp really\r\nexisted), became necessary; so, while the theatricals were in\r\npreparation, a small sledge was rigged up, Gregory and Sam Baker were\r\nchosen to go with him; the dogs were harnessed, and, on a fine, starry\r\nforenoon, away they went to the south at full gallop, with three hearty\r\ncheers from the crew of the brig, who were left in charge of the first\r\nmate.\r\n\r\nThe journey thus undertaken was one full of risk.  It was not known how\r\nfar distant the natives might be, or where they were likely to be found.\r\nThe weather was intensely cold.  Only a small quantity of preserved\r\nmeat could be taken--for the rest, they trusted in some measure to their\r\nguns.  But the captain's great hope was to reach the Eskimo village in a\r\nday or two at the farthest.  If he should fail to do so, the prospect of\r\nhimself and his crew surviving the remainder of the long winter was, he\r\nfelt, very gloomy indeed.\r\n\r\nSuccess attended this expedition at the very beginning.  They had only\r\nbeen eight hours out when they met a bear sitting on its haunches behind\r\na hummock.  \"Hallo! look out!\" cried Gregory, on catching sight of him.\r\n\"Fire, lads,\" said the captain, \"I'm not quite ready.\"  Gregory fired\r\nand the bear staggered.  Baker then fired and it fell!\r\n\r\nThis was a blessing which filled their hearts so full of thankfulness\r\nthat they actually shook hands with each other, and then gave vent to\r\nthree hearty cheers.  Their next thoughts were given to their comrades\r\nin the _Hope_.\r\n\r\n\"You and Baker will camp here, Tom,\" said the captain, \"and I will\r\nreturn to the brig with a sledge-load of the meat.  When I've put it\r\naboard I'll come straight back to you.  We'll keep a ham for ourselves,\r\nof course.  Now then, to work.\"\r\n\r\nTo work the three men went.  A hind leg of the bear was cut off, the\r\nrest was lashed firmly on the sledge, and the dogs enjoyed a feed while\r\nthis was being done.  Then the captain cracked his whip.  \"Good-bye,\r\nlads\", \"Good-bye, captain,\" and away he and the dogs and sledge went,\r\nand were soon lost to view among the hummocks of the frozen sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE ESKIMOS--WONDERFUL DOINGS--A MYSTERY.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this sledge party were so interesting that I give\r\nthem in the words of Tom Gregory's journal:\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday_.--We have indeed cause to rejoice and to thank God for His\r\nmercies this morning.  Last night we shot a bear, and the captain is\r\naway with the carcass of it to our poor scurvy-smitten friends in the\r\n_Hope_.  This Sunday will be a real day of rest for me and Sam Baker,\r\nthough our resting-place is a very queer one.  After the captain left\r\nus, we looked about for a convenient place to encamp, and only a few\r\nyards from the spot where we killed the bear we found the ruins of an\r\nold Eskimo hut made partly of stones, partly of ice.  We set to work to\r\npatch it up with snow, and made it perfectly air-tight in about two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\"Into this we carried our bear-skins and things, spread them on the\r\nsnowy floor, put a lump of bear's fat into our tin travelling lamp, and\r\nprepared supper.  We were not particular about the cookery.  We cut a\r\ncouple of huge slices off our bear's ham, half roasted them over the\r\nlamp, and began.  It was cut, roast, and come again, for the next hour\r\nand a half.  I positively never knew what hunger was until I came to\r\nthis savage country!  And I certainly never before had any idea of how\r\nmuch I could eat at one sitting!\r\n\r\n\"This hearty supper was washed down with a swig of melted snow-water.\r\nWe had some coffee with us, but were too tired to infuse it.  Then we\r\nblocked up the door with snow, rolled our bear-skins round us, and were\r\nsound asleep in five minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for us that we were so careful to stop up every hole with snow,\r\nfor, during the night the wind rose and it became so intensely cold that\r\nBaker and I could scarcely keep each other warm enough to sleep, tired\r\nthough we were.  At this moment my fingers are so stiff that they will\r\nhardly hold the pencil with which I write, and the gale is blowing so\r\nfuriously outside that we dare not open the door.  This door, by the\r\nway, is only a hole big enough to creep through.  The captain cannot\r\ntravel to-day.  He knows we are safe, so I will not expect him.  I have\r\nbrought my small Testament with me.  It has hitherto been my constant\r\ntravelling companion.  I am thus provided with mental food.  But, in\r\ntruth, I shall not want much of that for the next twelve hours.  Rest!\r\nrest! rest! is what we require.  No one can imagine how a man can enjoy\r\nrest, after he has been for many months exposed to constant, exhausting,\r\nheart-breaking toil, with the thermometer _always_ below zero, and with\r\nnothing but salt food to keep him alive.\r\n\r\n\"_Tuesday night_.--Here we are at last--among the Eskimos! and what a\r\nqueer set they are, to be sure.  All fat and fur!  They look as broad as\r\nthey are long.  They wear short fox and seal-skin coats, or shirts, with\r\nhoods to then; no trousers, but long boots, that come up and meet the\r\ncoats.  Women, men, and babies, all dressed alike, or nearly so.  The\r\nonly difference is that the women's boots are longer and wider than\r\nthose of the men.  But I forgot--yes, there is one other difference; the\r\nwomen have _tails_ to their coats; the men have none!  Real tails--not\r\nlike the broad skirts of our dress-coats, but long, narrow tails,\r\nsomething like the tail of a cow, with a broadish flap at the end of it.\r\nThis they evidently look upon as a handsome ornament, for I observe\r\nthat when they go off on a journey, each woman buttons her tail up to\r\nher waist, to keep it out of the way, and when she returns she unbuttons\r\nit, and comes into camp with her tail flowing gracefully behind her!\r\n\r\n\"We had a terrible journey of it down here.  The captain returned to us\r\non Monday morning early, and the next two days we spent struggling over\r\nthe hummocks and out upon the floes.  It was so cold that the wind cut\r\ninto our very marrow.  We have all had our faces frozen, more or less,\r\nbut not badly.  Baker will have an ugly spot on the end of his nose for\r\nsome weeks to come.  It is getting black now, and as the nose itself is\r\nbright red and much swelled, his appearance is not improved.  I\r\nfoolishly tried to eat a little snow yesterday morning, and the\r\nconsequence is that my lips are sore and bloody.  On Monday afternoon\r\nthe dogs and sledge went head over heels into a deep rut in the ice, and\r\nit cost us two hours to get them out again.  Luckily no damage was done,\r\nalthough the captain was on the sledge at the time.\r\n\r\n\"We had almost despaired of finding the village when we came upon a\r\nsledge track that led us straight up to it.  I shall never forget the\r\nbeauty of the scene on our arrival.  The sky was lighted up with the\r\nmost beautiful aurora I have yet seen in these regions.  Stars spangled\r\nthe sky in millions.  Great ice-bergs rose in wild confusion in the\r\ndistance, and all along the shore for a few hundred yards were clusters\r\nof snow-huts.  They looked exactly like bee-hives.  I have seen many a\r\nstrange house, but the strangest of all is certainly a house of snow!\r\nTo-day I was fortunate enough to see one built.  It was done very\r\nneatly.  The hard snow was cut into slabs with a wooden knife.  These\r\nwere piled one above another in regular order, and cemented with snow--\r\nas bricks are with lime.  The form of the wall was circular, and the\r\nslabs were so shaped that they sloped inwards, thus forming a dome, or\r\nlarge bee-hive, with a key-stone slab in the top to keep all firm.  A\r\nhole was then cut in the side for a door--just large enough to admit of\r\na man creeping through.  In front of this door a porch or passage of\r\nsnow was built.  The only way of getting into the hut is by creeping on\r\nhands and knees along the passage.  A hole was also cut in the roof,\r\ninto which was inserted a piece of clear ice, to serve for a window.\r\n\r\n\"The natives received us with wild surprise, and I found my old friends,\r\nthe walrus-hunters, among them.  They were remarkably friendly.  One\r\nstout, middle-aged fellow invited us to his hut.  I am now seated in it\r\nbeside the Eskimo's wife, who would be a good-looking woman if she were\r\nnot so fat, dirty, and oily!  But we cannot expect people living in this\r\nfashion, and in such a country, to be very clean.  Although the hut is\r\nwhite outside, it is by no means white inside.  They cook all their food\r\nover an oil-lamp, which also serves to heat the place; and it is\r\nwonderful how warm a house of snow becomes.  The cold outside is so\r\ngreat as to prevent the walls melting inside.  Besides Myouk, our host,\r\nand his wife, there are two of the man's sisters, two lads, two girls,\r\nand a baby in the hut.  Also six dogs.  The whole of them--men, women,\r\nchildren, and dogs, are as fat as they can be, for they have been\r\nsuccessful in walrus-hunting of late.  No wonder that the perspiration\r\nis running down my face!  The natives feel the heat, too, for they are\r\nall half-naked--the baby entirely so; but they seem to like it!\r\n\r\n\"What a chattering, to be sure!  I am trying to take notes, and Myouk's\r\nwife is staring at me with her mouth wide open.  It is a wonder she can\r\nopen her eyes at all, her cheeks are so fat.  The captain is trying, by\r\nthe language of signs, to get our host to understand that we are much in\r\nwant of fresh meat.  Sam Baker is making himself agreeable to the young\r\npeople, and the plan he has hit upon to amuse them is to show them his\r\nwatch, and let them hear it tick.  Truly, I have seldom seen a happier\r\nfamily group than this Eskimo household, under their snowy roof!\r\n\r\n\"There is to be a grand walrus-hunt to-morrow.  We shall accompany them,\r\nand see whether our endurance on a long march, and our powers with the\r\nrifle, cannot impress them with some respect for us.  At present they\r\nhave not much.  They seem to think us a pale-faced set of helpless\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n\"_Wednesday night_.--We have just returned from the hunt; and a\r\ntremendous hunt it was!  Six walrus and two bears have been killed, and\r\nthe whole village is wild with delight.  Cooking is going on in every\r\nhut.  But they have no patience.  Nearly everyone is munching away at a\r\nlump of raw walrus flesh.  All their faces are more or less greasy and\r\nbloody.  Even Myouk's baby--though not able to speak--is choking itself\r\nwith a long, stringy piece of blubber.  The dogs, too, have got their\r\nshare.  An Eskimo's chief happiness seems to be in eating, and I cannot\r\nwonder at it, for the poor creatures have hard work to get food, and\r\nthey are often on the verge of starvation.\r\n\r\n\"What a dirty set they are!  I shall never forget the appearance of\r\nMyouk's hut when we entered it this evening after returning from the\r\nhunt.  The man's wife had made the wick of her stone lamp as long as\r\npossible in order to cook a large supper.  There were fifteen people\r\ncrowded together in this hive of snow, and the heat had induced them to\r\nthrow off the greater part of their clothing.  Every hand had a greasy\r\nlump of bear or walrus meat in it; every mouth was in full occupation,\r\nand every fat face, of man, woman, and child, was beaming with delight\r\nand covered with dirt and oil!\r\n\r\n\"The captain and I looked at each other and smiled as we entered, and\r\nSam Baker laughed outright.  This set all the natives laughing, too.  We\r\ndid not much relish the idea of supping and sleeping in such a place--\r\nbut necessity has no law.  We were hungry as hawks, desperately tired,\r\nand the temperature outside is 35 degrees below zero.  The first duty of\r\nthe night is now over.  We have supped.  The natives will continue to\r\neat the greater part of the night.  They eat till they fall asleep; if\r\nthey chance to awake they eat again.  Half of them are asleep now, and\r\nsnoring.  The other half are eating slowly, for they are nearly full.\r\nThe heat and smell are awful!  I am perspiring at every pore.  We have\r\ntaken off as much of our clothes as decency will permit.  Sam has on a\r\npair of trousers--nothing more.  I am in the same state!  There is\r\nlittle room, as may be supposed.  We have to lie huddled up as we best\r\ncan, and a strange sight we are as the red light of the flaring lamp\r\nfalls on us.  At this moment Myouk's wife is cutting a fresh steak.  The\r\nyoungest boy is sound asleep with a lump of fat between his teeth.  The\r\ncaptain is also sound, with his legs sprawling over the limbs of half a\r\ndozen slumbering natives.  He is using the baby as a pillow.  It is\r\ncurious to think that these poor creatures always live in this way.\r\nSometimes feasting, sometimes starving.  Freezing out on the floes;\r\nstewing under their roofs of snow.  Usually fat; for the most part\r\njolly; always dirty!\r\n\r\n\"It is sad, too, to think of this; for it is a low condition for human\r\nbeings to live in.  They seem to have no religion at all.  Certainly\r\nnone that is worthy of the name.  I am much puzzled when I think of the\r\ndifficulties in the way of introducing Christianity among these northern\r\nEskimos.  No missionary could exist in such a climate and in such\r\ncircumstances.  It is with the utmost difficulty that hardy seamen can\r\nhold out for a year, even with a ship-load of comforts.  But this is too\r\ndeep a subject to write about to-night!  I can't keep my eyes open.  I\r\nwill, therefore, close my note-book and lie down to sleep--perhaps to be\r\nsuffocated!  I hope not!\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, our young friend the doctor did lie down to sleep, and got\r\nthrough the night without being suffocated.  Indeed, he slept so soundly\r\nthat Captain Harvey could scarcely rouse him next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Tom!  Tom!\" cried he loudly, at the same time shaking his\r\nnephew's arm violently.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, eh!\" and a tremendous yawn from Tom.  \"What now, uncle?  Time to\r\nrise, is it?  Where am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time to rise!\" replied the captain, laughing.  \"I should think it is.\r\nWhy, it's past eleven in the forenoon.  The stars are bright and the sky\r\nclear.  The aurora, too, is shining.  Come, get up!  The natives are all\r\noutside watching Sam while he packs our sledge.  The ladies are going\r\nabout the camp whisking their tails and whacking their babies in great\r\nglee, for it is not every day they enjoy such a feed as they had last\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nIn half an hour they were ready.  The whole village turned out to see\r\nthem start.  Myouk, with his wife Oomia, and the baby, and his son\r\nMeetek, accompanied them to Refuge Harbour.  Oomia's baby was part of\r\nherself.  She could not move without it!  It was always naked, but being\r\nstuffed into the hood of its mother's fur-coat, it seemed always warm.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Tom, what's that up in the sky?\" said Captain Harvey suddenly,\r\nafter they had been driving for a couple of hours.  \"It's the strangest\r\nlooking thing I ever did see.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" replied Gregory, gazing intently at the object in question,\r\nwhich seemed high up in the air.  \"It can't be a comet, because it gives\r\nno light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but it has got a tail, that's a fact,\" said Baker, in a\r\nvoice of surprise.  \"Who ever heard of a dark, four-cornered star with a\r\ntail?  If I had seen it in daylight, and in Merry England, I would have\r\nsaid it was a kite!\"\r\n\r\n\"A kite! nonsense,\" cried the captain; \"what in the world _can_ it be?\"\r\n\r\nReader, you shall find that out in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTHE TALE OF A KITE--A GREAT BEAR-FIGHT.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Mansell was left in charge of the brig a heavy weight lay on\r\nhis heart, and he could by no means take part in the preparations for\r\nthe theatricals which occupied the rest of the crew.  He felt that life\r\nor death depended on the success of the captain in his search for fresh\r\nmeat.  Already most of the men were ill with scurvy, and some of them\r\nwere alarmingly low.  Nothing could save them but fresh meat, and when\r\nthe first mate thought of the difficulties and dangers of a journey on\r\nthe floes in such weather, and the uncertainty of the Eskimos being\r\ndiscovered, his heart misgave him.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after the departure of Captain Harvey on the Monday\r\nmorning he took Davy Butts aside.\r\n\r\n\"Davy,\" said he, \"you've been at work on these kites a long time.  Are\r\nthey nearly finished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite finished, sir,\" answered Butts.\r\n\r\n\"Then get them up, for there is a good breeze.  I shall try them on our\r\nsmall sledges.  It will at least stir up and amuse the men.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes after this the crew were summoned on deck to witness an\r\nexperiment.  A small dog sledge lay on the hard snow beside the vessel,\r\nand near to this Davy Butts and Mr Dicey were holding on to a stout\r\nline, at the end of which an enormous kite was pulling.\r\n\r\nThis kite was square in shape, made of the thickest brown paper, and\r\nnearly six feet across.  That its power was great was evident from the\r\ndifficulty with which the two men held it.  The end of the line was\r\nfastened to the sledge.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, ease off line till it is taut, and then wait for the word,\"\r\nsaid Davy Butts, jumping on to the sledge.  \"Now!  Let go!\"\r\n\r\nAway went the sledge over the hard snow at the rate of three miles an\r\nhour, which soon increased to double that rate.  Davy cheered and waved\r\nhis arms.  The men gave one loud \"hurrah\" of surprise and delight, and\r\nset off in mad pursuit.  They were soon left behind.  \"Hold on, Davy!\"\r\n\"Good-bye, Butts.\"  \"Look out, mind the ridge!\"\r\n\r\nThe last warning was needful.  The sledge was rushing furiously toward a\r\nlong ridge of ice which rose in a sharp slope to a height of three feet,\r\nand descended on the other side to an equal depth, but without any\r\nslope.  Davy saw his danger, but he did not dare to put out foot or hand\r\nto check his progress.  Even if he had it would have been of no use.  Up\r\nthe slope he went as a sea-gull skims over a wave; for one moment he was\r\nin the air--the next, he came down with a crash that nearly dislocated\r\nall his joints, and his teeth came together with a loud snap.  (By good\r\nfortune his tongue was not between them!)  The sledge was a strong one,\r\nand the thing was done so quickly and neatly that it did not upset.  But\r\nnow a large and rugged hummock lay right before him.  To go against that\r\nwould have been certain death, so Davy made up his mind at once, and\r\njumped off at the smoothest part of the floe he could find.  The\r\nlightened sledge sprang away like a rocket, and was brought up with a\r\nsudden jerk by the hummock.\r\n\r\nOf course the line broke, and the kite commenced to descend.  It twirled\r\nand circled violently round, and at last went crash into an ice-berg,\r\nwhere it was broken to pieces!\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad for a beginning,\" said Mansell, as poor Davy came back,\r\nlooking very crest-fallen.  \"Now, Butts, come below.  You have proved\r\nthat the thing will do.  Mr Dicey, get yourself ready for a trip over\r\nthe ice.  Let three men prepare to accompany you.  I shall send you off\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nDicey, much surprised, went off to obey these orders; and Mansell, with\r\nthe assistance of Butts, fitted the second kite for the intended\r\njourney.  He made a rough guess at the strength of its pull, and loaded\r\nthe sledge accordingly.  Two tail ropes were fastened to the last bar of\r\nthe sledge for the men to hold on by and check its speed.  A sort of\r\nanchor was made by which it could be stopped at any moment, and two\r\nstout poles, with iron claws at the end of them, were prepared for\r\nscraping over the snow and checking the pace.\r\n\r\nNext day all was ready.  A trial was made and the thing found to work\r\nadmirably.  The trial trip over, they bade their comrades farewell, and\r\naway they went due south, in the direction where the native village was\r\nsupposed to be.\r\n\r\nIt was this remarkable tow-horse that had filled Captain Harvey and his\r\ncompanions with so much surprise.  The appearance of the sledge\r\nimmediately after, with a shout and a cheer from Dicey and the men,\r\nexplained the mystery.\r\n\r\nBeing so near the Eskimo camp they at once returned to it, in order to\r\nallow the newly arrived party to rest, as well as to load their sledge\r\nwith as much fresh meat as it could carry; for which supplies the\r\ncaptain took care to pay the natives with a few knives and a large\r\nquantity of hoop-iron--articles that were much more valuable to them\r\nthan gold.  As the wind could not be made to turn about to suit their\r\nconvenience, the kite was brought down and given to Davy to carry, and a\r\nteam of native dogs were harnessed to the sledge instead.  On the\r\nfollowing day the united party set out on their return to the brig,\r\nwhich they reached in safety.\r\n\r\nTom Gregory's account of the Eskimos who accompanied them to their\r\nwooden home is amusing.  His journal runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"The amazement of our visitors is very great.  Myouk, his wife and baby,\r\nand his son Meetek, are now our guests.  When they first came in sight\r\nof the brig they uttered a wild shout--the men did so, at least--and\r\ntossed their arms and opened their eyes and mouths.  They have never\r\nshut them since.  They go all round the vessel, staring and gaping with\r\namazement.  We have given them a number of useful presents, and intend\r\nto send them home loaded with gifts for their friends.  It is necessary\r\nto make a good impression on them.  Our lives depend very much on the\r\nfriendship of these poor people.  We find that they are terrible\r\nthieves.  A number of knives and a hatchet were missed--they were found\r\nhidden in Myouk's sledge.  We tried to prevail on Oomia to sell her long\r\nboots.  To our surprise she was quite willing to part with _one_, but\r\nnothing would induce her to give up the _other_.  One of the men\r\nobserved her steal a knife out of the cabin and hide it in the leg of\r\nher boot.  The reason was now plain.  We pulled off the boot without\r\nasking leave, and found there a large assortment of articles stolen from\r\nus.  Two or three knives, a spoon, a bit of hoop-iron, and a marline\r\nspike.  I have tried to make them understand, by signs, that this is\r\nvery wicked conduct, but they only laugh at me.  They are not in the\r\nleast ashamed, and evidently regard stealing as no sin.\r\n\r\n\"We have shot a musk ox.  There are many of these creatures in other\r\nparts of the Arctic regions, but this is the first we have seen here.\r\nHe fell to my rifle, and is now being devoured by ourselves and our dogs\r\nwith great relish.  He is about the size of a very small cow; has a\r\nlarge head and enormously thick horns, which cover the whole top of his\r\nhead, bend down toward his cheeks, and then curve up and outward at the\r\npoint.  He is covered with long, brown hair, which almost reaches the\r\nground, and has no tail worthy of the name.  He seems to be an active\r\nand an angry creature.  When I wounded him he came at me furiously, but\r\nhad not pluck to charge home.  As he turned away I gave him the shot\r\nthat killed him.  The meat is not bad, but it smells strongly of musk.\r\nWalrus is better.\r\n\r\n\"Myouk and his son Meetek and I have had a most exciting bear-hunt since\r\nwe returned.  I followed these men one day, as I thought them bold,\r\nactive-looking fellows, who would be likely to show me good Eskimo\r\nsport.  And I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"About two miles from the brig we came on fresh bear tracks.  A glow of\r\nthe aurora gave us plenty of light.  `What is yon round white lump?'\r\nthought I.  `A bear?  No, it must be a snow-wreath!'  Myouk did not\r\nthink so, for he ran behind a lump of ice, and became excited.  He made\r\nsigns to me to remain there while he and his son should go and attack\r\nthe bear.  They were armed each with a long lance.  I must say, when I\r\nremembered the size and strength of the polar bear, that I was surprised\r\nto find these men bold enough to attack him with such arms.  I had my\r\nrifle, but determined not to use it except in case of necessity.  I\r\nwished to see how the natives were accustomed to act.\r\n\r\n\"They were soon ready.  Gliding swiftly from one lump of ice to another,\r\nthey got near enough to make a rush.  I was disobedient!  I followed,\r\nand when the rush was made I was not far behind them.  The bear was a\r\nvery large one.  It uttered an angry growl on seeing the men running\r\ntoward it, and rose on its hind legs to receive them.  It stood nearly\r\neight feet high when in this position, and looked really a terrible\r\nmonster.  I stood still behind a hummock at a distance of about fifty\r\nyards, with my rifle ready.\r\n\r\n\"On coming close up the father and son separated, and approached the\r\nbear one on each side.  This divided his attention, and puzzled him very\r\nmuch; for, when he made a motion as if he were going to rush at Myouk,\r\nMeetek flourished his spear, and obliged him to turn--then Myouk made a\r\ndemonstration, and turned him back again.  Thus they were enabled to get\r\nclose to its side before it could make up its mind which to attack.  But\r\nthe natives soon settled the question for it.  Myouk was on the bear's\r\nright side, Meetek on its left.  The father pricked it with the point of\r\nhis lance.  A tremendous roar followed, and the enraged animal turned\r\ntowards him.  This was just what he wanted, because it gave the son an\r\nopportunity of making a deadly thrust.  Meetek was not slow to do it.\r\nHe plunged his lance deep into the bear's heart, and it fell at once at\r\nfull length, while a crimson stream poured out of the wound upon the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"While this fight was going on I might have shot the animal through the\r\nheart with great ease, for it was quite near to me, and when it got up\r\non its hind legs its broad chest presented a fine target.  It was\r\ndifficult to resist the temptation to fire, but I wished to see the\r\nnative manner of doing the thing from beginning to end, so did not\r\ninterfere.  I was rewarded for my self-denial.\r\n\r\n\"Half an hour later, while we were dragging the carcass toward the brig,\r\nwe came unexpectedly upon another bear.  Myouk and Meetek at once\r\ngrasped their lances and ran forward to attack him.  I now resolved to\r\nplay them a trick.  Besides my rifle I carried a large horse-pistol in\r\nmy belt.  This I examined, and, finding it all right, I followed close\r\nat the heels of the Eskimos.  Bruin got up on his hind legs as before,\r\nand the two men advanced close to him.  I stopped when within thirty\r\nyards, cocked my rifle, and stood ready.  Myouk was just going to thrust\r\nwith his lance when--_bang_! went my rifle.  The bear fell.  It was shot\r\nright through the heart, but it struggled for some time after that.  The\r\nnatives seemed inclined to run away when they heard the shot, but I\r\nlaughed and made signs of friendship.  Then I went close up and shot the\r\nbear through the head with my pistol.  This affair has filled my savage\r\ncompanions with deep respect for me!\"\r\n\r\nThese two bears were the last they obtained that winter; but as a good\r\nsupply of meat had been obtained from the Eskimos, they were relieved\r\nfrom anxiety for the time, and the health of the men began to improve a\r\nlittle.  But this happy state of things did not last till spring.  These\r\nsorely tried men were destined to endure much suffering before the light\r\nof the sun came back to cheer their drooping spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS TIME--DEATH--RETURN OF LIGHT AND HOPE--DISASTERS AND FINAL\r\nDELIVERANCE.\r\n\r\nChristmas came at last, but with it came no bright sun to remind those\r\nice-bound men of our Saviour--the \"Sun of Righteousness\"--whose birth\r\nthe day commemorated.  It was even darker than usual in Refuge Harbour\r\non that Christmas-day.  It was so dark at noon that one could not see\r\nany object more than a few yards distant from the eyes.  A gale of wind\r\nfrom the nor'-west blew the snow-drift in whirling ghost-like clouds\r\nround the _Hope_, so that it was impossible to face it for a moment.  So\r\nintense was the cold that it felt like sheets of fire being driven\r\nagainst the face!  Truly it was a day well fitted to have depressed the\r\nheartiest of men.  But man is a wonderful creature, not easy to\r\ncomprehend!  The very things that ought to have cast down the spirits of\r\nthe men of the _Hope_ were the things that helped to cheer them.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, as I have said, the health of the crew had improved a\r\nlittle, so they were prepared to make the most of everything.  Those\r\nfeelings of kindliness and good-will which warm the breasts of all\r\nright-minded men at this season of the year, filled our Arctic voyagers\r\nto overflowing.  Thoughts of \"home\" came crowding on them with a power\r\nthat they had not felt at other times.  Each man knew that on this day,\r\nmore than any other day of that long, dark winter, the talk round a\r\nwell-known hearth in Merry England would be of one who was far, far away\r\nin the dark regions of ice and snow.  A tear or two that could not be\r\nforced back tumbled over rough cheeks which were not used to _that_ kind\r\nof salt water; and many a silent prayer went up to call down a blessing\r\non the heads of dear ones at home.\r\n\r\nIt blew \"great guns outside,\" as Baker said, but what of that? it was a\r\ndead calm in the cabin!  It was dark as a coal-hole on the floes.  What\r\nthen? it was bright as noon-day in the _Hope_!  No sun blazed through\r\nthe skylight, to be sure, but a lamp, filled with fat, glared on the\r\ntable, and a great fire of coal glowed in the stove.  Both of these\r\ntogether did not make the place too warm, but there were fur-coats and\r\ntrousers and boots to help defy the cold.  The men were few in number\r\nand not likely to see many friends on that Christmas-day.  All the more\r\nreason why they should make the most of each other!  Besides, they were\r\nwrong in their last idea about friends, for it chanced, on that very\r\nday, that Myouk the Eskimo paid them a visit--quite ignorant of its\r\nbeing Christmas, of course.  Meetek was with him, and so was Oomia, and\r\nso was the baby--that remarkably fat, oily, naked baby, that seemed\r\nrather to enjoy the cold than otherwise!\r\n\r\nThey had a plum-pudding that day.  Butts said it was almost as big as\r\nthe head of a walrus.  They had also a roast of beef--walrus-beef, of\r\ncourse--and first-rate it was.  But before dinner the captain made them\r\ngo through their usual morning work of cleaning, airing, making beds,\r\nposting journals, noting temperatures, opening the fire-hole, and\r\nredding up.  For the captain was a great believer in the value of\r\ndiscipline.  He knew that no man enjoys himself so much as he who has\r\ngot through his work early--who has done his duty.  It did not take them\r\nlong, and when it was done the captain said, \"Now, boys, we must be\r\njolly to-day.  As we can't get out we must take some exercise indoors.\r\nWe shall need extra appetite to make away with that plum-pudding.\"\r\n\r\nSo, at it they went!  Every sort of game or feat of strength known to\r\nsailors was played, or attempted.  It was in the middle of all this that\r\nMyouk and his family arrived, so they were compelled to join.  Even the\r\nfat baby was put into a blanket and swung round the cabin by Jim Croft,\r\nto the horror of its mother, who seemed to think it would be killed, and\r\nto the delight of its father, who didn't seem to care whether it was\r\nkilled or not.\r\n\r\nThen came the dinner.  What a scene that was, to be sure!  It would take\r\na whole book to describe all that was said and done that day.  The\r\nEskimos ate till they could hardly stand--that was their usual custom.\r\nThen they lay down and went to sleep--that was their usual custom, too.\r\nThe rest ate as heartily, poor fellows, as was possible for men not yet\r\nquite recovered from scurvy.  They had no wine, but they had excellent\r\ncoffee, and with this they drank to absent friends, sweethearts, and\r\nwives, and many other toasts, the mere mention of which raised such\r\nstrong home-feelings in their breasts that some of them almost choked in\r\nthe attempt to cheer.  Then came songs and stories--all of them old,\r\nvery old indeed--but they came out on this occasion as good as new.  The\r\ngreat event of the evening, however, was a fancy ball, in which our\r\nfriends Butts, Baker, Gregory, and Pepper distinguished themselves.\r\nThey had a fiddle, and Dawkins the steward could play it.  He knew\r\nnothing but Scotch reels; but what could have been better?  They could\r\nall dance, or, if they could not, they all tried.  Myouk and Meetek were\r\nmade to join and they capered as gracefully as polar bears, which\r\nanimals they strongly resembled in their hairy garments.  Late in the\r\nevening came supper.  It was just a repetition of dinner, with the\r\nremains of the pudding fried in bear's grease.\r\n\r\nThus passed Christmas-Day; much in the same way passed New Year's Day.\r\nThen the men settled down to their old style of life; but the time hung\r\nso heavy on their hands that their spirits began to sink again.  The\r\nlong darkness became intolerable and the fresh meat began to fail.\r\nEverything with life seemed to have forsaken the place.  The captain\r\nmade another trip to the Eskimo village and found the huts empty--the\r\nwhole race had flown, he knew not whither!  The private theatricals were\r\nat first very successful; but by degrees they lost their interest and\r\nwere given up.  Then a school was started and Gregory became head\r\nmaster.  Writing and arithmetic were the only branches taught.  Some of\r\nthe men were much in need of instruction, and all of them took to the\r\nschool with energy and much delight.  It lasted longer than the\r\ntheatricals did.  As time wore on the fresh meat was finished, scurvy\r\nbecame worse; and it was as much as the men who were not quite knocked\r\ndown could do to attend to those who were.  Day after day Tom and\r\nGregory and Sam Baker went out to hunt, and each day returned\r\nempty-handed.  Sometimes an Arctic hare or a fox was got; but not often.\r\nAt last rats were eaten as food.  These creatures swarmed in the hold\r\nof the brig.  They were caught in traps and shot with a bow and a\r\nblunt-headed arrow.  But few of the men would eat them.  The captain\r\nurged them to do so in vain.  Those who did eat kept in better health\r\nthan those who did not.\r\n\r\nAt last death came.  Mr Mansell sank beneath the terrible disease and\r\nwas buried on the island.  No grave could be dug in that hard frozen\r\nsoil.  The burial service was read by his sorrowing comrades over his\r\nbody, which was frozen quite hard before they reached the grave, and\r\nthen they laid it in a tomb of ice.\r\n\r\nTime hung heavier than ever after that.  Death is at all time a terrible\r\nvisitant, but in such a place and under such circumstances it was\r\ntenfold more awful than usual.  The blank in so small a band was a great\r\none.  It would perhaps have depressed them more than it did had their\r\nown situation been less desperate.  But they had too fierce a battle to\r\nfight with disease, and the midnight gloom, and the bitter frost, to\r\ngive way to much feeling about him who was gone.\r\n\r\nThus the long winter passed heavily away.\r\n\r\nThe sun came back at last, and when he came his beams shone upon a pale,\r\nshattered, and heart-weary band of men.  But with his cheering light\r\ncame also _hope_, and health soon followed in his train.  Let young\r\nGregory's journal tell the rest of our story, little of which now\r\nremains to be told.\r\n\r\n\"_February 21st_.--I have to record, with joy and gratitude, that the\r\nsun shone on the peaks of the ice-bergs to-day.  The first time it has\r\ndone so since October last.  By the end of this month we shall have his\r\nrays on deck.  I climbed to the top of a berg and actually bathed in\r\nsunshine this forenoon!  We are all quite excited by the event, some of\r\nus even look jolly.  Ah! what miserable faces my comrades have! so pale,\r\nso thin!  We are all as weak as water.  The captain and I are the\r\nstrongest.  Baker is also pretty well.  Crofts and Davis are almost\r\nuseless, the rest being quite helpless.  The captain cooks, Baker and I\r\nhunt, Crofts and Davis attend to the sick.  Another month of darkness\r\nwould have killed the half of us.\r\n\r\n\"_March 10th_.--I shot a bear to-day.  It did my heart good to see the\r\nfaces of the men when I brought them the news and a piece of the flesh!\r\nThe cold is not quite so intense now.  Our coldest day this year has\r\nbeen the 17th of January.  The glass stood at 67 degrees below zero on\r\nthat morning.  What a winter we have had!  I shudder when I think of it.\r\nBut there is more cause to be anxious about what yet lies before us.  A\r\nsingle bear will not last long.  Many weeks must pass before we are\r\nfree.  In June we hope to be released from our ice-prison.  Fresh meat\r\nwe shall then have in abundance.  With it strength will return, and\r\nthen, if God permits, we shall attempt to continue our voyage northward.\r\nThe captain is confident on the point of open water round the Pole.\r\nThe men are game for anything in spite of their sad condition.\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote Gregory at that date.  Many weeks later we find him writing\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"_June 15th_.--Free at last!  The ice has been breaking up out at sea\r\nfor some time past.  It gave way in Refuge Harbour yesterday, and we\r\nwarped out in the night.  Everything is ready to push north again.  We\r\nhave been feeding heartily for many weeks on walrus, seals, wild-fowl,\r\nand last, but not least, on some grasses which make bad greens, but they\r\nhave put scurvy to flight.  All the men are well and strong and fit for\r\nhard work--though nothing like what they were when we first came here.\r\nCould it be otherwise?  There are some of us who will carry the marks of\r\nthis winter to our graves.  The bright beautiful sunshine shines now,\r\nall day and all night, cheering our hearts and inspiring hope.\r\n\r\n\"_June 16th_.--All is lost!  How little we know what a day may bring\r\nforth!  Our good little brig is gone, and we are here on the ice without\r\na thing in the world except the clothes on our backs.  I have saved my\r\nnote-book, which chanced to be in my breast-pocket when the nip took\r\nplace.  How awfully sudden it was!  We now appreciate the wise\r\nforethought of Captain Harvey in sending the large boat to Forlorn-Hope\r\nBay.  This boat is our last and only hope.  We shall have to walk forty\r\nmiles before we reach it.\r\n\r\n\"Our brig went down at three o'clock this afternoon.  We had warped out\r\ninto the floes to catch a light breeze that was blowing outside.  For\r\nsome time we held on steadily to the northward, but had not got out of\r\nsight of our winter quarters when a stream of ice set down upon us and\r\nclosed in all around.  At first we thought nothing of this, having\r\nescaped so many dangers of the kind last autumn, but by degrees the\r\npressure increased alarmingly.  We were jammed against a great ice-field\r\nwhich was still fast to the shore.  In a few moments the sides of our\r\nlittle vessel began to creak and groan loudly.  The men laboured like\r\ntigers at the ice-poles, but in vain.  We heard a loud report in the\r\ncabin.  No one knows what it was, but I suppose it must have been the\r\nbreaking of a large bolt.  At any rate it was followed by a series of\r\ncrashes and reports that left no doubt in our minds as to what was going\r\non.  The ice was cracking the brig as if she had been a nut-shell.\r\n`Save yourselves, lads!' cried the captain.  One or two of the men made\r\na rush to the hatchway, intending to run below and save some of their\r\nthings.  I ran to the cabin-ladder in the hope of saving our log-book\r\nand journals, but we all started back in horror, for the deck at that\r\nmoment burst open almost under our feet.  I cast one glance down through\r\nthe opening into the hold.  That glance was sufficient.  The massive\r\ntimbers and beams were being crushed together, doubled up, split, and\r\nshivered, as if they had been rotten straws!  In another moment I was on\r\nthe ice, where the whole crew were assembled, looking on at the work of\r\ndestruction in solemn silence.\r\n\r\n\"After bursting in the vessel's sides the ice eased off, and she at once\r\nbegan to settle down.  We could hear the water rushing furiously into\r\nthe hold.  Ten minutes later she was gone!  Thus end our hopes of\r\nfarther discovery, and we are now left to fight our way in an open boat\r\nto the settlements on the south coast of Greenland.  We have little time\r\nto think.  Prompt action must be our watchword now, if we would escape\r\nfrom this world of ice.\r\n\r\n\"_July 20th_.--I have not entered a line in this journal since our\r\nvessel was lost.  Our work has been so severe, and our sufferings so\r\ngreat, that I have had no heart for writing.  Our walk to the place\r\nwhere we left the boat was a hard one, but we were cheered by finding\r\nthe boat all safe, and the provisions and stores just as we left them.\r\nThere was not enough to last out the voyage, but we had guns and powder.\r\nIt is in vain to attempt to describe the events of the last few weeks.\r\nConstant, and hard, and cold work--at the oars, with the ice-poles--\r\nwarping, hauling, and shoving.  Beset by ice; driving before storms;\r\ndetained by thick fogs; often wet to the skin; always tired, almost\r\nstarving--such has been our fate since that sad day when our brig went\r\ndown.  And yet I don't think there is one of our party who would not\r\nturn about on the spot and renew our voyage of discovery, if he only got\r\na chance of going in a well-appointed vessel.  As it is, we must push\r\non.  Home! home! is our cry now.\r\n\r\n\"_August 1st_.--We are now in clover, after having been reduced to think\r\nof roasting our shoes for breakfast.  For three days last week we ate\r\nnothing at all.  Our powder has been expended for some weeks past.  On\r\nMonday we finished our last morsel of the gull that Pepper managed to\r\nbring down with a stone.  Tuesday was a terrible day.  The agony of\r\nhunger was worse than I had expected it to be.  Nevertheless, we tried\r\nhard to cheer each other as we laboured at the oars.  Our only hope was\r\nto fall in with natives.  Signs of them were seen everywhere, and we\r\nexpected to hear their shouts at every point of land we doubled.  The\r\ncaptain suggested that we should try _shoe-soup_ on Wednesday morning!\r\nHe was more than half in earnest, but spoke as if he were jesting.\r\nPepper cocked his ears as if there was some hope still of work for him\r\nto do in his own line.  Jim Crofts pulled off his shoe, and, looking at\r\nit earnestly, wondered if the sole would make a very tough chop.  We all\r\nlaughed, but I cannot say that the laugh sounded hearty.  On the\r\nThursday I began to feel weak, but the pangs of hunger were not so bad.\r\nOur eyes seemed very large and wolfish.  I could not help shuddering\r\nwhen I thought of the terrible things that men have done when reduced to\r\nthis state.\r\n\r\n\"That evening, as we rounded a point, we saw an Eskimo boy high on a\r\ncliff, with a net in his hand.  He did not see us for some time, and we\r\nwere so excited that we stopped rowing to watch him in breathless\r\nsilence.  Thousands of birds were flying round his head among the\r\ncliffs.  How often we had tried to kill some of these with sticks and\r\nstones, in vain!  The net he held was a round one, with a long handle.\r\nSuddenly he made a dashing sweep with it and caught two of the birds as\r\nthey passed!  We now saw that a number of dead birds lay at his feet.\r\nIn one moment our boat was ashore and we scrambled up the cliffs in\r\neager haste.  The boy fled in terror, but before he was well out of\r\nsight every man was seated on a ledge of rock with a bird at his mouth,\r\nsucking the blood!  Hunger like ours despises cookery!  It was fortunate\r\nthat there were not many birds, else we should have done ourselves harm\r\nby eating too much.  I have eaten many a good meal in my life, but never\r\none so sweet, or for which I was so thankful, as that meal of raw birds,\r\ndevoured on the cliffs of Greenland!\r\n\r\n\"That night we reached the Eskimo village, where we now lie.  We find\r\nthat it is only two days' journey from this place to the Danish\r\nsettlements.  There we mean to get on board the first ship that is bound\r\nfor Europe--no matter what port she sails for.  Meanwhile we rest our\r\nweary limbs in peace, for our dangers are past, and--thanks be to God--\r\nwe are saved.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReader, my tale is told.  A little book cannot be made to contain a long\r\nstory, else would I have narrated many more of the strange and\r\ninteresting events that befell our adventurers during that voyage.  But\r\nenough has been written to give some idea of what is done and suffered\r\nby those daring men who attempt to navigate the Polar seas.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
