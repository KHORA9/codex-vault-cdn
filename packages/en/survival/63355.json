PASTEUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur misfortunes inspired me with the idea of these researches. I\r\nundertook them immediately after the war of 1870, and have since\r\ncontinued them without interruption, with the determination of\r\nperfecting them, and thereby benefiting a branch of industry wherein we\r\nare undoubtedly surpassed by Germany.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that I have found a precise, practical solution of the\r\narduous problem which I proposed to myself—that of a process of\r\nmanufacture, independent of season and locality, which should obviate\r\nthe necessity of having recourse to the costly methods of cooling\r\nemployed in existing processes, and at the same time secure the\r\npreservation of its products for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThese new studies are based on the same principles which guided me in my\r\nresearches on wine, vinegar, and the silkworm disease—principles, the\r\napplications of which are practically unlimited. The etiology of\r\ncontagious diseases may, perhaps, receive from them an unexpected light.\r\n\r\nI need not hazard any prediction concerning the advantages likely to\r\naccrue to the brewing industry from the adoption of such a process of\r\nbrewing as my study of the subject has enabled me to devise, and from an\r\napplication of the novel facts upon which this process is founded. Time\r\nis the best appraiser of scientific work, and I am not unaware that an\r\nindustrial discovery rarely produces all its fruit in the hands of its\r\nfirst inventor.\r\n\r\nI began my researches at Clermont-Ferrand, in the laboratory, and with\r\nthe help, of my friend M. Duclaux, professor of chemistry at the Faculty\r\nof Sciences of that town. I continued them in Paris, and afterwards at\r\nthe great brewery of Tourtel Brothers, of Tantonville, which is admitted\r\nto be the first in France. I heartily thank these gentlemen for their\r\nextreme kindness. I owe also a public tribute of gratitude to M. Kuhn, a\r\nclever brewer of Chamalières, near Clermont-Ferrand, as well as to M.\r\nVelten, of Marseilles, and to MM. de Tassigny, of Reims, who have placed\r\nat my disposal their establishments and their products, with the most\r\npraiseworthy willingness.\r\n\r\nL. PASTEUR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, _June 1, 1876_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first idea of placing before English brewers a translation of “Études\r\nsur la Bière” was meagre in the extreme, compared with the final\r\nrealization of it as it appears in the following pages.\r\n\r\nSeeing the vast importance of Pasteur’s work from a practical point of\r\nview, after writing a review of it for the _Brewers’ Journal_, I\r\ndetermined to procure, at any rate for the use of my pupils, a literal\r\ntranslation, illustrated by photo-lithographic copies of the original\r\nplates, the thankless task of executing this preliminary translation for\r\nso limited a number of readers being most kindly and generously carried\r\nout for me by my friend Mr. Frank U. Waite, who, being engaged with me\r\nat the time in practical brewing operations, shared my views as to the\r\nvalue of the original work.\r\n\r\nIt was on the completion of this translation that my views and desires\r\nexpanded. The more I studied the work, the more I was convinced of its\r\nimmense value to the brewer as affording him an intelligent knowledge of\r\nthe processes and materials with which he deals, but over and above all\r\nthis, it was impossible not to feel that the researches of such a\r\ndevoted and accomplished _savant_ as Pasteur, possessed a scientific\r\ninterest much wider than their mere relation to the art of brewing would\r\nimply. As the work of a skilful chemist and a laborious and accurate\r\nobserver, such a protracted and careful study of the lowest and simplest\r\nforms of life, must necessarily be of first importance to the\r\nbiologist—to the beginner as an admirable introduction to the study of\r\npractical physiology in general, as well as to the more advanced\r\nstudent, from the suggestive light which it throws on the nature of\r\nanalogous phenomena in more complex organisms.\r\n\r\nI determined accordingly _to publish_ the work if I could secure the\r\nconsent of its distinguished author, but at the same time I felt that\r\nthe publication of M. Pasteur’s “Studies” in the form in which Mr. Waite\r\nhad, at my request, translated it, and illustrated only with inferior\r\ncopies of the original plates, would not be either advisable or just;\r\nbut that I was bound rather to put the book before the English public in\r\nas satisfactory and complete a form as lay within my power. Under these\r\ncircumstances I was induced to seek the aid of Mr. D. Constable Robb,\r\nB.A., of The Oxford University Museum, who, in taking Mr. Waite’s\r\nversion as a basis, has so elaborated, annotated, and recast it, that I\r\nfeel bound to say that much of the value of “Studies on Fermentation,”\r\nas it now appears, is due to the care that Mr. Robb has bestowed upon\r\nthe revision that he so kindly undertook; a revision the result of which\r\nhas created a feeling of confidence in the success of the translation as\r\nit now stands, which I could not have had in any mere literal version.\r\n\r\nTo the practical worker the original illustrations alone, which appear\r\nin this version, cannot but be of immense value in the microscopical\r\nstudy of the changes in the liquids with which he deals; whilst the many\r\nnotes and additions, which are a feature peculiar to the English\r\nedition, more particularly the rendering into the equivalents, with\r\nwhich, unfortunately, practical men on this side of the channel are\r\nstill most at home, of the metric weights and measures and centigrade\r\ntemperatures, as well as the Index which Mr. Robb has compiled, will, I\r\ntrust, render the book of still greater service than it otherwise would\r\nhave been to many of those who may favour it with their attention.\r\n\r\nThe debt which we English brewers owe to M. Pasteur can hardly be\r\nover-estimated, and I must be allowed here to express my personal\r\nobligations to that distinguished worker for the permission which allows\r\nthis translation; and to the French publishers for their help with\r\nregard to the interleaved illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe author’s preface and dedication are, of course, reproduced, the\r\nformer making it unnecessary for me to refer more in detail to the\r\ncontents of the translation.\r\n\r\nFRANK FAULKNER.\r\n\r\nTHE BREWERY, ST.

It may\r\nbe described as an infusion of germinated barley and hops, which has\r\nbeen caused to ferment after having been cooled, and which, by means of\r\n“settling” and racking, has ultimately been brought to a high state of\r\nclarification. It is an alcoholic beverage, vegetable in its origin—a\r\n_barley wine_, as it is sometimes rightly termed.[1]\r\n\r\nBeer and wine, however, differ widely in their composition. Beer is less\r\nacid and less alcoholic than wine; it holds more ingredients in\r\nsolution, and the nature of these ingredients is by no means similar to\r\nthat of those which are found in wine.\r\n\r\nThese differences in the component parts of wine and beer give rise to\r\ncorresponding differences in the keeping qualities of the two liquids.\r\nThe small amount of acidity in beer, its poverty in alcohol, and the\r\npresence of matter that is saccharine, or liable to become so, all\r\noperate in imparting to beer a tendency to change, which wine does not\r\npossess. That this unequal resistance to the aggression of diseases is\r\ndue to such differences, may be proved by the fact that wine could be\r\nmade much more liable to change than it actually is, by a diminution of\r\nits acidity and its usual proportion of alcohol, or by increasing the\r\nproportion of viscid or saccharine matters,[2] modifications which would\r\ntend to assimilate its composition to that of beer.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked elsewhere that the pains devoted to the rearing of\r\nvines, and to the ordinary operations of vinification, such as\r\n_ouillage_,[3] sulphuring, and repeated rackings, as well as the use of\r\ncellars and vessels hermetically closed, are entailed by the necessity\r\nof counteracting and preventing the diseases to which wine is liable.\r\nThe same may be said, _a fortiori_, of beer, inasmuch as it is more\r\nliable to change than wine. Manufacturers and retailers of this beverage\r\nhave to strive constantly with the difficulty of preserving it, or the\r\nwort used in its manufacture. We may readily be convinced of this by\r\nreviewing the usual processes of the art of brewing.\r\n\r\nWhen the infusion of malt and hops, which is termed wort, is completed,\r\nit is left to cool. It is next put into one or more casks or vats, in\r\nwhich it is made to undergo alcoholic fermentation—the most important of\r\nall the processes in brewing.\r\n\r\nThe cooling must be as rapid as possible. This is a condition of\r\nsuccess; otherwise, the wort may deteriorate, which will necessarily\r\nlead to deterioration in the quality of the beer. As long as the wort is\r\nat a high temperature it will remain sound; when under 70° C. (158° F.),\r\nand particularly when at a temperature of from 25° C. to 35° C. (77° F.\r\nto 95° F), it will be quickly invaded by lactic and butyric ferments.\r\nRapidity in cooling is so essential that to secure it recourse is had to\r\nspecial apparatus.[4] Even in the preparation of wort, especially when\r\nit is effected by successive mashings, in summer, deterioration is\r\nimminent: in fact, it is not rare to see the wort becoming acid during\r\nthe _mashes_, if these are not accomplished with all possible celerity.\r\n\r\nAfter the wort has been cooled, it is mixed with yeast. This is obtained\r\nfrom a previous fermentation, and, after being thoroughly pressed, is\r\nadded at the rate of from one to two thousandth parts of the weight of\r\nthe wort, that is, from 100 to 200 grammes per hectolitre (about 4 oz.\r\nto 8 oz. average for every 25 gallons). At first sight, this yeast seems\r\nfree from the possible diseases of the wort and beer; but this is by no\r\nmeans the case.\r\n\r\nNow, why do we add yeast to our wort? This practice is unknown in the\r\nart of vinification. The must is always left to spontaneous\r\nfermentation. Why should we not leave the wort to operate in the same\r\nmanner?\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that in the brewing of beer yeast is\r\nadded with the sole object of accelerating fermentation, and making it\r\nmore rapid. Rapidity in fermentation is a very questionable advantage,\r\nand one which is not desired by brewers, who rather agree in\r\npronouncing it injurious to the quality of beer. It is in the easy\r\ndeterioration of the wort, or what is tantamount to it, in the\r\nfacility it affords to various spontaneous fermentations, that we find\r\nan answer to these questions. The must, through its acidity, due to\r\nthe presence of bitartrate of potash—which seems to promote alcoholic\r\nfermentation—through its proportion of sugar, and perhaps in\r\nconsequence of some other peculiarity of its composition, always\r\nundergoes regular alcoholic fermentation. The diseases of wine, at the\r\ncommencement of its manufacture, show themselves, so to say, in a\r\nlatent state only. Therefore a vintage can be left, without\r\ninconvenience, to spontaneous fermentation.\r\n\r\nWith wort the case is quite different. Under certain accidental\r\ncircumstances it is possible that alcoholic fermentation alone may take\r\nplace in a wort left to ferment spontaneously, and the quality of the\r\nbeer remain unimpaired, but such an event would be exceptional, and of\r\nvery rare occurrence. In most cases we should obtain an acid or putrid\r\nliquid resulting from the production and multiplication of alien\r\nferments.\r\n\r\nThe addition of yeast is made in consequence of the necessity of\r\nexciting through the whole bulk of wort, as soon as it is cold, a single\r\nfermentation—viz., the alcoholic, the only one that can produce beer\r\nproperly so called.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic ferments concerned in the production of beer will be found\r\nrepresented in several of the engravings in this work. Other ferments we\r\nmay term “diseased”; these include all those that may occur\r\nspontaneously—that is, whose germs have not been directly and\r\nintentionally introduced—amongst the actual alcoholic ferments.\r\n\r\nThe expression, “diseased ferments,” is justified by the circumstance\r\nthat the propagation of these ferments is always accompanied by the\r\nproduction of substances which are acid, putrid, viscous, bitter, or\r\notherwise unpalatable, a consideration of commercial rather than\r\nscientific importance. From a physiological point of view, all these\r\nferments are of equal interest and importance. The botanist, as a man of\r\nscience, in contemplating nature, must give equal attention to all\r\nplants, whether useful or noxious, since they are all governed by the\r\nsame natural laws, among which no order of merit could be established.\r\nThe exigencies of industry and health require, however, wide\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 1. Principal Disease-ferments met with in Wort and\r\nBeer.]\r\n\r\nThe first engraving (Plate I.) represents the different diseased\r\nferments, together with some cells of alcoholic yeast, to show the\r\nrelative size of these organisms.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 of the engraving represents the ferments of _turned_ beer, as it\r\nis called. These are filaments, simple or articulated into chains of\r\ndifferent size, and having a diameter of about the thousandth part of a\r\nmillimetre (about 1/25000 inch). Under a very high power they are seen\r\nto be composed of many series of shorter filaments, immovable in their\r\narticulations, which are scarcely visible.\r\n\r\nIn No. 2 are given the lactic ferments of wort and beer. These are\r\nsmall, fine and contracted in their middle. They are generally detached,\r\nbut sometimes occur in chains of two or three. Their diameter is a\r\nlittle greater than that of No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn No. 3 are given the ferments of putrid wort and beer. These are\r\nmobile filaments whose movements are more or less rapid, according to\r\nthe temperature. Their diameter varies, but is for the most part greater\r\nthan that of the filaments of Nos. 1 and 2. They generally appear at the\r\ncommencement of fermentation, when it is slow, and are almost invariably\r\nthe result of very defective working.\r\n\r\nIn No. 4 are given the ferments of viscous wort, and those of ropy beer,\r\nwhich the French call _filante_. They form chaplets of nearly spherical\r\ngrains. These ferments rarely occur in wort, and still less frequently\r\nin beer.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 represents the ferments of pungent, sour beer, which possesses an\r\nacetic odour. These ferments occur in the shape of chaplets, and consist\r\nof the _mycoderma aceti_, which bears a close resemblance to lactic\r\nferments (No. 2), especially in the early stages of development. Their\r\nphysiological functions are widely different, in spite of this\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\nThe ferments given in No. 7 characterize beer of a peculiar acidity,\r\nwhich reminds one more or less of unripe, acid fruit, with an odour _sui\r\ngeneris_. These ferments occur in the form of grains which resemble\r\nlittle spherical points, placed two together, or forming squares. They\r\nare generally found with the filaments of No. 1, and are more to be\r\nfeared than the latter, which cause no very great deterioration in the\r\nquality of beer, when alone. When No. 7 is present, by itself or with\r\nNo. 1, the beer acquires a sour taste and smell that render it\r\ndetestable. We have met with this ferment existing in beer,\r\nunaccompanied by other ferments, and have been convinced of its fatal\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 represents one of the deposits belonging to wort. This must not be\r\nconfounded with the deposits of diseased ferments. The latter are always\r\nvisibly organized, whilst the former is shapeless, although it would not\r\nalways be easy to decide between the two characters, if several samples\r\nof both descriptions were not present. This shapeless deposit interferes\r\nwith wort during its cooling. It is generally absent from beer, because\r\nit remains in the backs, or on the coolers; or it may get entangled in\r\nthe yeast during fermentation and disappear with it.\r\n\r\nAmong the shapeless granulations of No. 6 may be discerned little\r\nspheres of different sizes and perfect regularity. These are balls of\r\nresinous and colouring matter that are frequently found in old beer, at\r\nthe bottom of bottles or casks; sometimes they occur in wort preserved\r\nafter Appert’s method. They resemble organized products, but are nothing\r\nof the kind. We have remarked before, in “Studies on Wine,” that the\r\ncolouring matter of wine would settle, in course of time, in that form.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the different ferments delineated in Plate I. are\r\nworthy of thorough study, in consequence of the fermentations to which\r\nthey may give rise. Care must be taken to isolate the action of each of\r\nthem in fermentations which we may call pure—a condition of some\r\ndifficulty, but one that may be carried out by an adoption of the\r\nmethods explained in this work.\r\n\r\nAll these diseased ferments have a common origin. Their germs,\r\ninfinitesimal and hardly perceptible as they are, even with the aid of\r\nthe microscope, form a part of the dust conveyed through the air. This\r\ndust the air is continually taking from or depositing upon all objects\r\nin nature, so that the dust that clings to the ingredients from which\r\nour beer is manufactured, may teem with the germs of diseased ferments.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of fermentation, the occult power of diseased\r\nferments, although it may escape the observation of the brewer, is\r\nmanifested in a high degree.\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years, or so, the art of brewing has undergone a\r\nradical change, at least in Europe. This change has been effected by a\r\npartial abandonment of the process of fermentation formerly used. Thirty\r\nyears ago only one kind of beer was known; there are nowadays two\r\ndistinct kinds—beer fermented at a high temperature, and beer fermented\r\nat a low temperature. Each of these is subdivided into many varieties,\r\nto which different names are given, according to their strength or\r\ncolour. This is the case in England, where we find porter, ale, pale\r\nale, stout, bitter beer, and other varieties of beer, although, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the English have but one kind of beer, all the English\r\nbeers being fermented at a high temperature.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly examine the differences existing between the two kinds of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nFormerly all beer was fermented at a high temperature. The wort, after\r\nhaving been cooled in the backs, was run into a large vat, at a\r\ntemperature of about 20° C. (68° F.). Yeast was then added to it, and\r\nwhen the fermentation began to show itself, in the formation of a light,\r\nwhite froth, upon the surface of the liquid, the wort was run into\r\ncasks, having a capacity of from 50 to 100 litres (11 to 22 gallons)—75\r\nlitres being the commonest size. These casks were placed in cellars,\r\nhaving a temperature of from 18° C. to 20° C. (64° F. to 68° F.). The\r\nactivity of fermentation soon produced a froth that grew thicker and\r\nmore and more viscous in proportion to the quantity of yeast it\r\ncontained. The yeast worked out of the bung-holes and dropped into a\r\nvessel placed under the casks; there it was gathered for subsequent\r\noperations. It always exceeded the quantity used in the first instance,\r\nthe ferment increasing greatly during the process of fermentation. The\r\nincrease in its weight varied with the weight of yeast used and the\r\ncomposition of the wort. Under the ordinary conditions of brewing, where\r\nthe weight of the pitching yeast was about one thousandth part of the\r\nweight of the wort, the increase is said to have been from five to seven\r\ntimes the weight of the yeast; but such increase must naturally have\r\nbeen determined by the quality of the wort, the quantity of hops used,\r\nthe action of oxygen, and the proportion of barm employed. The process\r\nof fermentation lasted from three to four days. By that time the beer\r\nwas finished, and had become limpid, the fermentation having been\r\ncompleted. The bungs could then be placed in the casks, and the beer be\r\ndelivered to the customer.[5] A certain amount of yeast still remained\r\nin the casks, and caused the beer to become thick, in transit; but a few\r\ndays’ rest sufficed to restore its brilliancy, and render it fit for\r\ndrinking or bottling.\r\n\r\nHere we have an explanation of the term “_high_ fermentation,” which has\r\nbeen applied to the foregoing process. This process is conducted at a\r\nhigh temperature, which, commencing at 19° C. or 20° C. (66° F. or 68°\r\nF.), is raised to 20° C. or 21° C. (68° or 70° F.) by the action of\r\nfermentation, which is always accompanied by an increase of heat.[6]\r\n\r\nThis is not, however, the only reason for the use of the term “_high_\r\nfermentation.” We have just seen that the fermenting casks were so\r\narranged that most of the yeast produced during the process of\r\nfermentation would rise to the upper part of the casks and work out of\r\nthe bung-holes. In this practical fact we have the actual origin of the\r\nexpressions “_high fermentation_” and “_high beer_,” which are used to\r\ndistinguish this peculiar fermentation and the quality of beer derived\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAs we have already observed, all beer was formerly produced by this mode\r\nof fermentation, which even at the present time is still practised in\r\nthe breweries of Great Britain, where beer fermented at a low\r\ntemperature is absolutely unknown.\r\n\r\n“Low fermentation” is a slow process, effected at a low temperature,\r\nduring which the yeast sinks to the bottom of the vats or casks. The\r\nwort, after cooling, is run into open wooden vats. In cooling, the wort\r\nis brought to as low a temperature as 8° C. (47° F.), or even 6° C. (43°\r\nF.), at which point it is maintained by cones or cylinders (styled\r\n_nageurs_, i.e., floats, by the French) floating in the fermenting vats.\r\nThese floats may be filled with ice if the outside temperature requires\r\nit, as is invariably the case in summer.\r\n\r\nThe duration of this fermentation is ten, fifteen, or even twenty days.\r\nThe yeast, which is produced less abundantly than in the case of beer\r\nfermented at a high temperature, is gathered after the beer has been\r\ndrawn off, and is partly used in subsequent fermentations.\r\n\r\nThe term “_low_ fermentation” is derived partly from the lowness of the\r\ntemperature during the fermenting process, and partly from the fact that\r\nthe yeast is gathered at the bottom, and not at the upper part of the\r\nfermenting vessels.[7]\r\n\r\nBeer fermented at a low temperature, of which there are several\r\nvarieties, differing in colour and quality, is of Bavarian origin.[8]\r\nThe preference of the public for this kind of beer, and the increased\r\nfacilities that such a beer affords the trade, are the two reasons why\r\nits manufacture has so greatly increased. In Austria, Bavaria, Prussia,\r\nand other Continental countries this new method of brewing is almost\r\nexclusively adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the _Moniteur de la Brasserie_ of the 23rd April, 1871, may be found\r\nthe following significant remarks on the increase in the production of\r\nbeer fermented at a low temperature on the Continent: “The number of\r\nbreweries manufacturing _high_ beer is rapidly decreasing, whilst the\r\nnumber of those producing _low_ beer is still more rapidly increasing.\r\nThere were in Bohemia, in 1860, 281 breweries in which high fermentation\r\nwas practised; in 1865, only 81 of these remained; in 1870, the number\r\nhad declined to 18. On the other hand, the number of breweries\r\npractising _low_ fermentation increased from 135 in 1860 to 459 in 1865,\r\nand in 1870 had risen to 831. In 1860 there were 620 breweries in which\r\nthe two methods were employed; in 1865 there were 486; in 1870 only 119\r\nremained. The number of breweries at present existing in Bohemia amounts\r\nto 968.”\r\n\r\nIn France, we are still in a period of transition; but year by year the\r\nmanufacture of “low beer” is increasing, to the evident detriment of its\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell upon certain differences existing between the\r\ntwo kinds of beer, such as may be traced to the preparation and\r\ncomposition of their respective worts. The brewing of “high beer,” by\r\nhand or machinery, is effected in one operation; the brewing of “low\r\nbeer” is accomplished by successive mashings, the temperatures of which\r\nare gradually raised. These differences, and others that result from the\r\nlonger boiling of the wort, in the “high fermentation” process, give\r\nrise to diversities in the composition and colour of the worts, from\r\nwhich circumstance “low beers” are sometimes termed _white beers_, in\r\ncontradistinction to the others, which have a deeper colour, and are\r\nknown as _dark beers_ (_bruns_). The name of Strasburg is generally\r\ngiven to “low beer” in France, but sometimes it is called German beer.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to account for the changes introduced into the construction\r\nand working of breweries by the new process of “low fermentation.” A low\r\ntemperature is essential not only to the manufacture but also to the\r\npreservation of “low beer,” and must be secured by the use of\r\nice-cellars in which the temperature may be maintained at 5° R. or 6° R.\r\n(43° F. or 45° F.), and even at 1°, 2°, or 3° R. (35° to 39° F.)\r\nthroughout the year. This necessitates an accumulation of ice and the\r\nconstruction of cellars of enormous extent, for the storage of the beer.\r\n“Low beer” is essentially a stock beer, especially if brewed in winter,\r\nwhen due advantage is taken of the low temperature of the season. It is\r\nkept in cold cellars until the spring or summer, when beer is consumed\r\nin larger quantities. It is calculated that 100 kilos. (1·96 cwt.) of\r\nice is the average quantity used per hectolitre (22 gallons) of good\r\nbeer, between the cooling of the wort and the day of sale.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of “high beer” we find none of these complications,\r\nnor have we in that manufacture any similar difficulty of working or\r\nexpense of construction to contend against. The whole process of\r\nbrewing, including the delivery of the beer, does not take more than\r\neight days. Why should a mode of brewing so simple, so rapid, and\r\ncomparatively so inexpensive, have been abandoned by the greater part of\r\nEurope in favour of a system disadvantageous to the brewer in so many\r\nrespects? It would be a mistake to suppose that the sole reason for such\r\na change might be found in the superior quality of “low beer.” That such\r\na superiority does exist is admitted as a fact by the majority of beer\r\ndrinkers; but taken by itself, this fact is not sufficient to account\r\nfor the radical transformation that has taken place in the manufacture\r\nof beer, as is proved by the example of England, which, we believe, does\r\nnot possess as yet one single “low beer” brewery, from which\r\ncircumstance we may fairly suppose that the English have a decided\r\npreference for “high beer.”\r\n\r\nThe principal advantage of working at a low temperature lies in the fact\r\nthat “low beer” is less liable to deterioration, and is less prone to\r\ncontract diseases than “high beer,” especially whilst it remains in the\r\nbrewery—a circumstance that places the brewer in a position vastly\r\nsuperior to that which he occupied in former times. With the help of ice\r\nthe brewer can manufacture beer during winter and the early part of\r\nspring, for consumption in summer.[10] “High beer,” on the other hand,\r\nmust be consumed within a short time of its production. The brewer is\r\nthus compelled to manufacture it as it is wanted, and as orders are sent\r\nin, the demand for it being in a great measure dependent upon the state\r\nof the weather.\r\n\r\nConditions so unfavourable as these must necessarily operate\r\nprejudicially against trade. Industry requires more stability and\r\nuniformity, both in the production and the sale of its goods. “Low beer”\r\ncan be brewed in large quantities at any time to be delivered at any\r\nother time, according to requirements; its manufacture, therefore, is\r\nunattended by the inconveniences which we have just noticed.[11]\r\n\r\nHow is it that the use of ice and yeast operating at a low temperature\r\nso greatly facilitates the preservation of our beer and enables us to\r\nsecure such striking advantages? The explanation is simple: the diseased\r\nferments, which we have pointed out, rarely appear at a lower\r\ntemperature than 10° C. (50° F.), and at that temperature their germs\r\ncease to be active. The adoption of low temperatures by brewers is\r\nmainly due to this physiological fact. On one occasion only have we met\r\nwith active _vibrios_ (No. 3, Plate I.), at a very low temperature;\r\nthese were forming with great difficulty in wort fermenting at 5° C.\r\n(41° F.).\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that the changes which the manufacture of beer has\r\nundergone during the present century have been based mainly on the\r\ndiseases to which beer is liable, either during or after the process of\r\nbrewing. The fact that English brewers have not as yet adopted “low\r\nfermentation” may be accounted for, in a great measure, by the\r\ndifficulty of enlarging existing breweries, in cities like London, to\r\nthe extent required for the new method of manufacture. Even in the event\r\nof public taste demanding a “low beer,” English brewers will hesitate a\r\nlong time before converting their breweries. Such conversion would\r\nimpose upon them expenses and difficulties of a very serious nature. If\r\never such a change should take place, it will probably be inaugurated\r\nout of London. It is, however, worthy of remark that English brewers,\r\nwithout adopting “low fermentation,” have introduced considerable\r\nimprovements in brewing, especially in the management of the temperature\r\nduring fermentation; this must be preserved within narrow and exact\r\nlimits, for fear of injury to the product. It might easily be shown that\r\nthese improvements have resulted from the liability of the beer to\r\ncontract diseases, although this fact may not have been recognized by\r\nthe brewers who have introduced them.\r\n\r\nBesides the yeasts which belong to the two principal kinds of\r\nfermentation, there exist many varieties of alcoholic ferment that\r\nproduce, each of them, a special kind of beer. Among these special beers\r\nsome are deficient in taste, others in aroma, others in brilliancy. Let\r\nus suppose that in the manufacture of a beer with one of these yeasts,\r\nfrom which a peculiar flavour is derived, a different and inferior\r\nvariety is accidentally mixed with that which we intend to use; in such\r\na case, the inferior variety, the product of which will possess an\r\ninferior quality, will exercise such an influence on the brewing as to\r\ninduce the belief that disease must be present. The microscope, if\r\nconsulted, will reveal no special organism, nor any of those diseased\r\nferments of which we have given specimens. It is in the study of yeast\r\nthat we must endeavour to find the cause of the results we observe. This\r\npoint, which is of the greatest importance to brewers, will become\r\nclearer as we proceed.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the practices of the beer trade, in its retail as well as\r\nin its export branches, we shall find that many of them afford evidence\r\nof the liability of the beer to deteriorate. We may cite some of these.\r\nWhen taken out of the ice-cellars, the beer is kept in casks of small\r\ncapacity, that it may be the sooner consumed; when exposed to a high\r\ntemperature, the beer will not keep sound for any length of time, but\r\nwill speedily effloresce with _mycoderma vini_ or _mycoderma aceti_.\r\n\r\nBeer which is intended for bottling should not be kept for more than a\r\nmonth or six weeks. Even in bottling we may perceive the tendency of the\r\nliquid to deteriorate.[12] It is necessary that the bottles, immediately\r\nafter being filled, should be laid on their sides for twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight hours; they may then be placed upright; the reason for this\r\nis that the air left between the cork and the beer might give rise to\r\nthe production of efflorescence. If we lay the bottles down on their\r\nsides, the oxygen of this air will be absorbed by the oxidizable\r\nsubstances in the liquid, and there will be little fear of germs\r\ndeveloping themselves when the bottles are placed upright. The bottles\r\nshould not, however, be left on their sides longer than forty-eight\r\nhours; otherwise the supplementary fermentation may force the corks out.\r\nMoreover, when the bottles stand upright the products of fermentation\r\ncollect at the bottom, and not at the sides.\r\n\r\nBeer which is intended for keeping, if exported or conveyed some\r\ndistance off, must be surrounded with ice. Without this precaution it\r\nwill ferment too much or contract some disease.\r\n\r\n“High beer” cannot stand travelling. This kind of beer should not be\r\nexported unless the ordinary proportion of hops has been greatly\r\nincreased—hop oil acting in some respects as an antiseptic, and\r\npreventing the beer from contracting diseases.[13] The export of English\r\nbeer to India and the Continent has fallen off of late years, or rather,\r\nhas not increased to the extent that was anticipated; in fact, this\r\ntrade has entailed great losses upon those engaged in it. It is said\r\nthat an English firm lost as much as £48,000 on one consignment, which\r\non its arrival in India was found to be all turned.\r\n\r\nThere are no breweries in hot countries, where beer would command a very\r\nlarge sale. It is a well-known fact that beer is a remarkably pleasant\r\ndrink in tropical climates, provided its temperature be a few degrees\r\nbelow that of the atmosphere, but the expenses of its production would\r\nbe enormous, on account of the immense quantity of ice that would be\r\nrequired in its manufacture and for its preservation. It is in hot\r\ncountries that beer is most liable to deterioration.\r\n\r\nBeer is said to be the beverage of northern regions, which are deprived\r\nof the vine, by the rigour of their climate. In these regions man has\r\nsought in the abundance of grain-fruit a substitute for grapes. To a\r\ncertain extent this is true; nevertheless, it is an undoubted fact that\r\nbeer was first brewed in Egypt, a very hot country, whence its\r\nmanufacture has spread over Europe. It was called Pelusian wine, from\r\nPelusium, a city on the banks of the Nile, which produced a beer that\r\nwas held in high esteem.[14]\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt, hot countries, even those in which the vine is\r\ncultivated, would consume much beer, could it but stand their high\r\ntemperature.[15] A considerable quantity of beer is now brewed in\r\nBritish India, but its manufacture entails an enormous outlay for ice.\r\n\r\nThe complications which result from the tendency of wort and beer to\r\ndeteriorate, underlie almost all the details of the process of brewing\r\nand the sale of beer, and have been the cause of most of the changes and\r\nimprovements that have been effected in brewing, during the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  This expression is found for the first time, it would appear, in\r\n  Theophrastus, B.C. 371. [See, however, Herodotus, Bk. II., chap. 77.\r\n  Speaking of some Egyptians he says, “They drink a kind of wine made\r\n  from barley (ὄινῳ δ’ ἐκ κριθέων πεποιημένῳ), for the grape does not\r\n  grow in that part of the country.” Herodotus wrote about 450 B.C.\r\n  Æschylus (480 B.C.) has a similar expression, Suppl. 953.—D. C. R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  One of these modifications is a real source of serious danger to the\r\n  preservation of wine; for instance, during rainy years, at the time of\r\n  vintage, the grapes may happen to be covered with earthy matter,\r\n  consisting principally of carbonate of lime; this will dissolve in\r\n  wine and partly neutralize its acidity, and the wine will thus become\r\n  more liable to disease.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Transferring from one cask to another for the purpose of clarifying\r\n  the wine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n   We shall hereafter revert to this rapidity in cooling, to show that\r\n  it is also of use in the subsequent clarification of beer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  In some breweries (at Lyons especially) fermentation at a high\r\n  temperature is practised in large vats at about 15° C. (59° F.). The\r\n  yeast which covers the surface of the liquid is skimmed off and stored\r\n  in flat tubs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The initial temperature of the wort must be regulated by the quantity\r\n  of wort subjected to fermentation. In English breweries, where large\r\n  quantities are brewed at a time, the heat created by the action of\r\n  fermentation would produce a temperature sufficiently high to affect\r\n  the quality of the beer, if the yeast were added at 19° C. or 20° C.\r\n\r\n  The following are the temperatures at which the worts are pitched, in\r\n  the principal London breweries:—For common ale, 60° F. or 15·5° C.;\r\n  for pale ale, 58° F. or 14·4° C.; for porter, 64° F. or 17·8° C. The\r\n  fermentation is commenced in large vats; from these the beer is run\r\n  into vessels of a much smaller capacity, in which it completes its\r\n  fermentation by working off the yeast and cleansing itself.\r\n\r\n  For white beer of superior quality, the temperature during\r\n  fermentation must not rise beyond 72° F. or 22·2° C.; some brewers\r\n  never allow it to exceed 18°C. (65° F.). The temperature is lowered by\r\n  means of a current of cold water, which circulates through a coil\r\n  fixed in the vats or other fermenting vessels.\r\n\r\n  In the case of porter, the initial heat of which is 64° F. or 17·8°\r\n  C., the temperature in the vats sometimes rises to 78° F. or 25·5° C.;\r\n  but such an increase in temperature excites considerable apprehension.\r\n\r\n  We have seen a tun for pale ale, containing 200 barrels of 36 gallons,\r\n  pitched with 600 lbs. of fairly solid yeast. In forty-six hours the\r\n  attenuation was considered sufficient, and the beer, which from an\r\n  initial heat of 58·1° F. or 14·5° C., had risen to 72° F. or 22·2° C.,\r\n  was cleansed to working casks. The large vats in which the\r\n  fermentation is started may be considered as equivalent to the _cuves\r\n  guilloires_ of French breweries, the casks in which it is completed\r\n  and the yeast thrown off representing their 75-litre vessels,\r\n  improperly called _quarts_. Notwithstanding the enormous English beer\r\n  manufacture, and although the fermenting vat, as in making porter, for\r\n  instance, sometimes attains the capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 litres (400\r\n  to 600 gallons), the casks into which it is run are never larger than\r\n  15 to 20 hectolitres (300 to 400 gallons); and even at Burton, in the\r\n  celebrated breweries of Allsopp and Bass, the pale ale is finished in\r\n  casks of a capacity less than 10 hectolitres, and yet the average\r\n  turn-out of these immense works reaches 3,000 to 4,000 hectolitres\r\n  (60,000 to 80,000 gallons) of beer per day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  [The expressions “high” and “low” fermentation or beer strictly refer\r\n  to temperature, whereas the other expressions used (“top” or “bottom”)\r\n  refer to the behaviour of the yeast. The French words _haute_ and\r\n  _basse_ seem to look both ways.—D. C. R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  It is said that the floating cones or cylinders filled with ice, which\r\n  enable brewers to manufacture beer at a low temperature, even in\r\n  summer, were first used in Alsace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  45 million kilos. of ice are annually consumed in the brewery of M.\r\n  Dreher, in Vienna. The brewery of Sedlmayer, at Munich, uses about 10\r\n  million kilos. (_Journal des Brasseurs_, 22nd June, 1873.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  It should, however, be borne in mind that these remarks on the\r\n  relative preservative powers of the two beers hold true on account of\r\n  three things—differences in the respective modes of brewing,\r\n  artificial cooling during the process of fermentation, and the storing\r\n  of the “low beer” in ice-cellars. In itself, perhaps, “low beer” is\r\n  more liable to change than “high beer;” that this does not actually\r\n  take place, is due to the employment of artificial cooling. A brewery\r\n  which has an average annual production of 10,000 hect. will use 8,000\r\n  cwt. of ice. If we add to this the ice used during the retail of the\r\n  beer, which is best drunk at 12° C. (54° F.), we shall arrive at the\r\n  total of 100 kilos. per hectolitre.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  [In connection with the comparison here instituted by M. Pasteur\r\n  between the drinking and keeping qualities of the two kinds of beer,\r\n  it may be useful to draw the reader’s attention to a review by Dr.\r\n  Charles Graham of the French edition of this work, published in\r\n  _Nature_ for January 11th, 1877, page 216. At the same time we must\r\n  remark that Dr. Graham appears to have overlooked M. Pasteur’s\r\n  footnote, page 12, English edition:—“His assertion, that by bottom\r\n  fermentation store beers can be produced, whereas those produced by\r\n  top fermentation must be consumed at once and cannot be transported,\r\n  are certainly strange to an Englishman. So far from these unfavourable\r\n  comparisons being true in all cases, the exact opposite is generally\r\n  the case. Bavarian and other bottom fermentation beers are in fact\r\n  those which can neither be preserved nor transported without the\r\n  liberal employment of ice; even that sent from Vienna to London must\r\n  be kept cold artificially, in order to avoid rapid destruction. As\r\n  regards flavour, there are many who think a glass of Burton pale ale,\r\n  or of good old College rent ale, to be superior to any Bavarian beer.\r\n  The chief cause of the decline in the production of top fermentation\r\n  beers on the Continent has been the want of attention in the\r\n  fermentation process; whereas the English brewer, especially the\r\n  brewer of high-class ales, has been unremitting in his attention to\r\n  the temperature in fermentation and to the perfect cleansing of the\r\n  ale. Now, where such attention is given, it is not difficult to obtain\r\n  ales which will keep a few years. While objecting to our English\r\n  produce being so hastily depreciated by M. Pasteur, our brewers will\r\n  be the first to avail themselves of his biological researches, in\r\n  order to render their produce more stable and better flavoured,\r\n  without having recourse to the general adoption of the vastly more\r\n  costly system of bottom fermentation.”—D. C. R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  To preserve bottled beer from deterioration, some bottlers employ, at\r\n  the moment of filling, a small quantity of bisulphite of lime. Others\r\n  heat the bottles to a temperature of 55° C. (131° F.) In the north of\r\n  Germany and in Bavaria, this practice has been widely adopted since\r\n  the publication of the author’s “Studies on Wine,” and some of M.\r\n  Velten’s writings. The process has been termed _pasteurization_ in\r\n  recognition of the author’s discovery of the causes of deterioration\r\n  in fermented liquors, and of the means of preserving such liquors by\r\n  the application of heat. Unfortunately this process is less successful\r\n  in the case of beer than in that of wine, for the delicacy of flavour\r\n  which distinguishes beer is affected by heat, especially when the beer\r\n  has been manufactured by the ordinary process. This effect would be\r\n  less felt in beer manufactured by the process which is advocated in\r\n  this work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  A convincing proof of the influence of hops on the ferment organisms\r\n  is contained in the fact that beer, even after being raised to 60° C.\r\n  or 70° C. (140° or 160° F.), will, if unhopped, readily take on the\r\n  butyric fermentation, from which, if hopped, it would remain perfectly\r\n  free.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  For historical details, see _l’Encyclopédie_, Art. _Bière_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  As a wine-producing country France has been highly favoured by nature,\r\n  but the consumption of beer in France is increasing every year. In\r\n  1873 the quantity of beer, paying excise duties, amounted to 7,413,190\r\n  hect., which yielded to the Treasury the sum of 20,165,136 fr. These\r\n  figures are taken from a report published in 1875 by M. Jacquème,\r\n  inspector of finances, who remarks that the quantity of beer upon\r\n  which excise duties are paid represents, probably, not more than\r\n  one-third of the total production: two-thirds of the quantity brewed\r\n  evades the duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n       On the Causes of the Diseases which affect Beer and Wort.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our preceding observations it will be evident that the manufacture\r\nof beer, the arrangement of breweries, and all the processes practised\r\nby the brewer immediately depend upon this fact, that beer and wort are\r\nfluids essentially liable to change. Thus it becomes a matter of extreme\r\nimportance that we should have an exact knowledge of the causes and\r\nnature of the changes which affect our produce, and it may be that this\r\nknowledge will lead us to regard the conditions of the brewing industry\r\nfrom a novel point of view, and bring about important modifications in\r\nthe practices of the trade. We might vainly search the numerous works\r\nwhich have been written on brewing for information respecting the\r\nproposed subject of these studies. At the most we should find the\r\ndiseases to which beer is liable in the course of its manufacture, or\r\nafterwards, vaguely hinted at; perhaps we might be favoured with certain\r\nempirical recipes for disguising the evil effects of those diseases.\r\n\r\nIt will be our endeavour to demonstrate the truth of the proposition we\r\nhave already laid down, that every change to which wort and beer are\r\nliable is brought about solely by the development of organic ferments,\r\nwhose germs are being perpetually wafted to and fro in the dust floating\r\nthrough the air, or distributed over the surface of the different\r\nmaterials and utensils used in brewing, such as malt, yeast, water,\r\ncoolers, vats, tubs, casks, shovels, workmen’s clothes, and innumerable\r\nother things.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this proposition bears a marked resemblance to the\r\none which we have demonstrated concerning the diseases of wine.[16]\r\n\r\nBy the expression _diseases_ of wort and beer, we mean radical changes\r\nwhich so affect the nature of those liquids as to make them unpalatable,\r\nespecially if they are kept; such changes produce beer which is sharp,\r\nsour, turned, oily, putrid, and otherwise bad. It would be unreasonable\r\nto apply the term _disease_ to certain modifications in the quality of\r\nbeer, which may be produced by practices more or less commendable. Such\r\nmodifications, too, may result from want of skill in the brewer, from\r\nthe composition of the wort, from the specific nature of the yeast, or\r\nfrom the inferior quality of ingredients. It is a well-known fact that\r\n“low beer,” if manufactured according to the ordinary process, has not\r\nthat same delicacy of flavour which characterizes beer fermented at a\r\nlower temperature than 10° C. (50° F.). Fermented at 10° C. (50° F.), or\r\n12° C. (53° F.) or at a higher temperature, it loses the peculiar\r\nproperties which consumers prize. Nevertheless, in point of soundness it\r\nmay be as good a beer as one which has been fermented at 6° C. (43° F.),\r\nor 8° C. (46° F.). One might say of the former beer that it is inferior\r\nto the latter in estimation; but we could not rightly call it diseased,\r\nfor we are supposing a case in which disease does not actually exist.\r\n\r\n  § I.—Every Unhealthy Change in the Quality of Beer coincides with a\r\nDevelopment of Microscopic Germs which are alien to the Pure Ferment of\r\n                                 Beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur proposition concerning the causes of the diseases of wort and beer\r\nmight be demonstrated in several ways. The following is one of the\r\nsimplest:—Take a few bottles of sound beer, say, for instance, that\r\nwhich is known in Paris as Tourtel’s, Grüber’s, or Dreher’s, from the\r\nname of the brewer who manufactures it. Place some of these bottles in a\r\nhot-water bath and raise the temperature to about 60° C. (140° F.).\r\nPermit them to cool, and then place them by the side of the other\r\nbottles that have not been heated. In every case, especially if we\r\nconduct this experiment in summer, we shall find that in the course of a\r\nfew weeks—the length of time varying according to the temperature and\r\nthe quality of the beer—all the bottles which have not been heated will\r\nhave become diseased, in some cases even to the extent of being\r\nundrinkable. Let us next examine, by way of comparison, the deposits in\r\nthe heated and non-heated bottles. We shall find associated with the\r\npure alcoholic ferment other organisms, filiform and for the most part\r\nvery slender, and either simple or articulated, as represented in Plate\r\nII., the design of which is taken from actual deposits occurring in beer\r\nthat had been kept for some time at the ordinary temperature. A number\r\nof bottles of beer which had been heated on October 8th, 1871, were\r\ncompared with those of an equal number of bottles of the same beer which\r\nhad not been heated. The examination took place on July 27th, 1872. The\r\nbeer, which had been heated to 55° C. (131° F.), was remarkably sound,\r\nwell flavoured, and still in a state of fermentation. As a matter of\r\nfact, we have proved by exact experiments that alcoholic ferments,\r\nheated in beer, can endure a temperature of 55° C. (131° F.), without\r\nlosing the power of germination; but the action is rendered somewhat\r\nmore difficult and slower. Diseased ferments, however, existing in the\r\nsame medium, perish at this temperature, as they do in the case of wine.\r\nThe beer which had not been heated, had undergone changes which rendered\r\nit quite undrinkable. Its acidity, due to volatile acids, was higher\r\nthan that of the other beer in the proportion of 5 to 1. The beer which\r\nhad been heated contained ½ per cent. of alcohol more than the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 2. Appearance under the Microscope of the Deposit\r\nfrom “Turned” Beer.]\r\n\r\nThe deposits in the heated bottles also showed filaments of disease, but\r\nin such minute quantity that it was necessary to search many fields of\r\nthe microscope to discover their existence. Those which we found after\r\nthe heating must have existed in the beer before that operation; the\r\nheat had destroyed them, without sensibly altering their shape or size;\r\nthey could neither multiply nor continue to exert any influence upon the\r\ncomponents of the beer.[17]\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments we may easily perceive, on the one hand, that\r\nbeers apparently sound to the taste do not contain these or any other\r\nfiliform ferments, save in a scarcely appreciable quantity; and, on the\r\nother hand, that these same ferments appear with the first unfavourable\r\nchange in the quality of the beers, and that they exist more or less\r\nabundantly in proportion to the intensity of disease.\r\n\r\nIn certain extremely rare cases it may happen—so, at least, we have been\r\nassured, but we have not proved the fact ourselves—that beer may keep\r\nsound in bottle, even without the preliminary heating. This exception\r\ncan only occur in the case of certain beers of a peculiar composition,\r\nwhich are highly hopped, and are made during the favourable months of\r\nNovember or December, out of the choicest materials, and fermented with\r\nyeast that happens to be pure. In the deposit of such beer, even after a\r\nlapse of several months or several years, we should find only the\r\nordinary alcoholic ferment, the slow action of which would merely cause\r\na gradual increase in the quantity of alcohol existing in the beer, and\r\na diminution in the proportion of dextrine. This beer might grow old, as\r\nwine does, and remain perfectly sound.\r\n\r\nVery often the whole work of the brewer is jeopardized by the\r\nunsuspected presence of diseased ferments, a remedy for which is only\r\ndevised after the evil has evoked the complaints of customers. In such a\r\ncase the brewer avails himself of the kindness of some other brewer to\r\nobtain a change of yeast—a custom which is recognized and valued in the\r\ntrade, since all managers of breweries have an interest in keeping it\r\nup. The brewer whose produce is most satisfactory recognizes the fact\r\nthat unforeseen circumstances may compel him at any moment to change his\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\nWe have frequently had occasion to show that this necessity for a change\r\nof yeast depends, in most cases, on some change brought about by the\r\npresence of diseased ferments, the multiplication of which has resulted\r\nfortuitously from some unconscious neglect during the process of\r\nbrewing, or from climatic influences. When we reflect that yeast is a\r\nliving being, and that the medium which serves as its aliment, and the\r\nwater in which it lives, are remarkably well adapted for the development\r\nof a vast number of other microscopic beings, the comparative purity of\r\nyeast should surprise us even more than its deterioration does.\r\n\r\nNow by means of microscopical observations we might often detect the\r\nexistence of the evil long before we are warned of it by a defective\r\nworking, which invariably entails great losses.[18]\r\n\r\nIn proof of this remark we may cite the following facts. In the month of\r\nSeptember, 1871, we were permitted to go through a large London brewery,\r\nin which the microscopical study of yeast was altogether unknown. We\r\nwere allowed to make certain experiments in the presence of the managers\r\nof the establishment. We first examined porter yeast, which was\r\ncollected in a channel that received the yeast as it worked out of the\r\nfermenting vessels. One of the ferments of disease abounded in this\r\nyeast, as may be seen in the accompanying sketch, which was taken on the\r\nspot (Fig. 1). It was evident that the working of the porter was\r\nextremely unsatisfactory, and had, perhaps, been so for a long time;\r\nindeed, we were told that they had obtained a change of yeast from\r\nanother London brewery that same day. We made a point of examining this\r\nyeast with the microscope. It was beyond comparison purer than the\r\npreceding yeast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if these brewers had been in the habit of using the\r\nmicroscope they might have detected the unsoundness of their produce\r\nbefore the time when they actually made the discovery, which, no doubt,\r\nwas forced upon them by the complaints of their customers, or some other\r\nannoying circumstance, that led to their obtaining a change of yeast.\r\n\r\nWe next obtained permission to examine the yeast of the other beers\r\nundergoing fermentation, especially those of white beers, such as ale\r\nand pale ale.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch which we made of these yeasts one may detect the presence\r\nof the filaments peculiar to turned beer (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe examined with much interest the ales which had immediately preceded\r\nthose undergoing fermentation, the yeast of which we had just\r\ninspected. We were furnished with two kinds, both in casks, the one\r\nfined, the other not fined. The latter was visibly turbid, and,\r\nexamining a drop of it, we discovered three or four filaments present\r\nin every field of the microscope. The ale which had been fined was\r\nnearly clear, but wanting in brilliancy; it contained about one\r\nfilament to the field. We asserted in the presence of the head brewer,\r\nwho had been summoned, that these ales were extremely liable to\r\nchange, that it was highly necessary to dispose of them without delay,\r\nand that they were necessarily already faulty in flavour—a fact which\r\nall admitted after some hesitation—attributable, of course, to the\r\nnatural reluctance which every manufacturer feels to own that his\r\nproduce is not above reproach. We were shown some of the finings used\r\nin the brewery; they were swarming with the same filaments of\r\ndisease-organisms.\r\n\r\nWe then propounded to the managers certain questions on the subject of\r\nthe losses which a brewery may sustain from changes in its beer. We had\r\nheard from several brewers that the selling price of beer differed so\r\ngreatly from the cost of its production solely in consequence of the\r\nlosses which the unavoidable waste of large quantities of beer was\r\nconstantly causing; several brewers have in our presence estimated these\r\nlosses at 20 per cent. of the total production, on the average.\r\n\r\nAt first the English brewers returned somewhat vague answers to our\r\nquestions; however, after what had taken place, they doubtless\r\nrecognized the fact that a mutual understanding between a savant and a\r\npractical man may often be of considerable benefit to the latter, and in\r\nthe end they confessed to us that they had stowed away in their brewery\r\na large quantity of beer which had gone bad in cask a fortnight or so\r\nafter it was brewed. Having avowed thus much they expressed their great\r\nanxiety to learn the cause of so serious a change in their beer, which\r\nwas quite undrinkable. We examined it under the microscope, without\r\nbeing able to detect immediately any diseased ferments, but being aware\r\nthat the beer had probably been clarified, by remaining undisturbed for\r\na very long time, and that these ferments might have become inert and\r\nprecipitated to the bottom of the enormous vats containing the beer, we\r\nexamined the deposits which had formed at the bottom of these vats. They\r\nwere composed solely of filaments of disease-organisms, without even the\r\nleast trace of the globules of alcoholic yeast. The supplementary\r\nfermentation of this beer had evidently been nothing but a diseased\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between these filaments and those which, in considerably\r\nsmaller proportion, accompanied the globules of alcoholic ferment in our\r\npreceding observations, the change in the beer, which was almost as bad\r\nas beer could possibly be, along with an abundance of filaments, and the\r\nchange, to a minor extent, in that beer which only presented a few\r\nfilaments in a field of the microscope, impressed those managers of the\r\nbrewery who were present with an entire belief in the theory which we\r\nhad been endeavouring to impress on their minds concerning the causes of\r\nthe badness of their beer. Some eight days afterwards we paid another\r\nvisit to this same brewery, and learnt that the directors had lost no\r\ntime in acquiring a microscope, and in procuring changes of yeast for\r\nall the varieties of beer, which they had put in working since our first\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThere are some periods of the year—early spring, summer, and autumn, for\r\ninstance—when the working of a brewery is a matter of great difficulty.\r\nThe preservation of yeast becomes a subject requiring the most delicate\r\ntreatment, in consequence of the increase in the temperature. In the\r\nearly part of autumn the most important ingredients used in brewing are\r\nof inferior quality; the deteriorating influences which have been at\r\nwork have covered them with a variety of parasites. All these\r\ncircumstances contribute to facilitate the development of diseased\r\nferments.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II.—The Absence of Change in Wort and Beer Coincides with the Absence\r\n                         of Foreign Organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method which we have just pursued in demonstrating the existence of\r\na relation between the diseases of beer and certain microscopic\r\norganisms can scarcely leave a doubt, it seems to us, as to the\r\ncorrectness of the principles which we are advocating. In every case\r\nwhere the microscope reveals in a yeast, especially a yeast which is in\r\na state of activity, products which are foreign to the composition of\r\nalcoholic ferment, properly so called, the flavour of the beer is more\r\nor less unsatisfactory, according to the abundance or nature of these\r\nminute organisms. Moreover, when a finished beer of superior quality\r\nloses in the course of time its agreeable flavour, and becomes sour, it\r\nmay readily be shown that the alcoholic ferment in the deposit existing\r\nin bottles or casks, although originally pure, at least in appearance,\r\nbecomes gradually intermixed with these same filiform ferments or other\r\nones. These facts may be deduced from what precedes; nevertheless, some\r\nprejudiced minds might perhaps urge that these foreign ferments are the\r\nconsequence of some diseased condition, produced by circumstances of\r\nwhich we know nothing.\r\n\r\nAlthough this gratuitous supposition may be difficult to sustain, we\r\nshall endeavour to corroborate our preceding observations by the method\r\nof experiment which will be seen to be the more decisive.\r\n\r\nThis method consists in proving that beer never possesses any unpleasant\r\nflavour, so long as the alcoholic ferment, properly so called, is not\r\nassociated with foreign ferments; that this also holds good in the case\r\nof wort, and that wort, liable to change as it is, may be preserved in a\r\nstate of purity, if it is kept under conditions that protect it from the\r\ninvasion of microscopic parasites, to which it presents not only\r\nfavourable nutriment, but also a field for development.\r\n\r\nBy employing this second method we shall, moreover, have the advantage\r\nof proving with certainty a proposition that we just advanced, and\r\nshowing that the germs of these organisms proceed from the particles of\r\ndust which the common air wafts about and deposits on every object, or\r\nwhich are spread over the utensils and materials used in a brewery,\r\nmaterials that are naturally charged with microscopic germs, which\r\nvarious changes in the store-houses and maltings may multiply to an\r\nindefinite extent.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nLet us take a glass flask having a long neck (Fig. 3 A), and holding\r\nfrom 250 c.c. to 300 c.c. (_i.e._, about 9 or 10 fl. oz.); let us put\r\ninto it some wort, hopped or not, and then draw out the neck of the\r\nflask in the flame of a lamp, so as to give to it the shape B (Fig. 3);\r\nlet us next heat the liquid to the boiling point, when the steam will\r\nrush with a hissing sound out of the curved end. We may then, without\r\nfurther precaution, permit our flask to cool, or, as an additional\r\nsafeguard, we may introduce a small quantity of asbestos into the open\r\nextremity, at the very moment when the flame is taken away from the\r\nflask. Before introducing the asbestos, we may pass it through the\r\nflame, and we may repeat this after it has been placed in the end of the\r\ntube.[20] The air which first re-enters the flask must come in contact\r\nwith the heated glass and the hot liquid, and these will destroy the\r\nvitality of any germs existing in such particles of dust as this air may\r\nintroduce. The re-entrance of the air will be effected very\r\ngradually—sufficiently so to enable the drop of water which the air, as\r\nit enters, forces up the curved tube, to catch all particles of dust.\r\nUltimately, the tube will become dry, but then the passage of the air\r\nwill proceed so slowly that every foreign particle will get deposited on\r\nits interior sides.\r\n\r\nExperience tends to prove that external particles of dust cannot find\r\ntheir way into flasks of this pattern, having free communication with\r\nthe air, at all events within ten or twelve years—the longest time that\r\nhas been devoted to experiments of this kind; the liquid in the flasks,\r\nif originally clear, will not become in the least degree contaminated,\r\neither upon its surface or throughout its bulk, although the outside of\r\nthe flasks may be covered with a thick coat of dust. This is an\r\nundeniable proof of the impossibility of particles of dust finding their\r\nway inside such flasks.\r\n\r\nWort treated thus will preserve its purity for an indefinite time,\r\nnotwithstanding its extreme liability to rapid change when exposed to\r\nthe air, under conditions which cause it to come in contact with the\r\nparticles of dust that air contains. This also holds good in the case of\r\nwine, beef-tea, the must of grapes, and, generally speaking, of all\r\nliquids which are subject to putrefaction or fermentation, and which\r\npossess the faculty, when their temperature is raised to about 100°C.\r\n(212°F.), of destroying the vitality of those microscopic germs that are\r\nfound in dust.\r\n\r\nA flask such as we have described (Fig. 3) is all that we require when\r\nwe have to demonstrate the facts that we have just reviewed, a more\r\ndetailed account of which may be found in our Memoir published in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, for 1862, under the title _Mémoire\r\nsur les corpuscules organisés en suspension dans l’atmosphère. Examen de\r\nla doctrine des générations spontanées._ The shape of the flask\r\nrepresented in Fig. 4 only differs from that of the preceding one in\r\nhaving a second little tube attached to the globular part of the flask;\r\nthis presents great advantages for different objects of study, and it\r\nwas adopted in the subsequent investigations detailed in this work.\r\n\r\nThis flask will permit us to study without difficulty every separate\r\nkind of microscopic organism in the liquid best adapted to it without\r\nfear, if we take reasonable precautions, that the subject of our study\r\nmay become associated with other organisms, the accidental presence of\r\nwhich cannot fail to seriously affect the results of our observations.\r\n\r\nLet us use one of those flasks in our experiment on yeast, at the same\r\ntime expressly assuming that the minute germs of yeast are free from all\r\ncontamination by foreign germs, an object which we shall learn how to\r\nrealize by a variety of methods in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nLet us introduce some wort into our flask (Fig. 4); then, after we have\r\nfitted an india-rubber tube to the little supplementary tube, let us\r\nboil the liquid; the steam, finding an easier exit through the\r\nindia-rubber opening than through the drawn-out tube, will rush out\r\nthrough the india-rubber tube, and thus, as it passes, destroy any germs\r\nwhich may be adhering to the sides of the little supplementary tube. If\r\nwe close the india-rubber tube by means of a glass stopper, the steam\r\nwill immediately issue through the bent tube. On permitting the flask to\r\ncool, it will then be ready for impregnation. If there were any fear\r\nthat some foreign germ of an unknown nature might have effected an\r\nentrance during cooling, or had not been destroyed by the steam (which\r\nis always a little super-heated, in consequence of the resistance which\r\nit meets in escaping), we need only place the flasks on a warm stove,\r\nand leave them there for a few days or a few weeks to ascertain whether\r\nthe liquid in them has undergone any change. We should then only use\r\nthose flasks which contain a sound liquid.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we must warn our readers that this cause of error does\r\nnot exist once in a thousand times, especially if we use an asbestos\r\nstopper to prevent the entrance of little insects which are attracted by\r\nthe odour of the liquid, and which instinctively seek to enter at the\r\nextremity of the tube, and to pass through it into the flask. In going\r\nso far, and incurring such labour in search of their food, they condemn\r\nthemselves to certain death, for they are sure to be drowned, since it\r\nwould require an intelligence superior to that which they possess to\r\nenable them to get out of the flask; the liquid, morever, could not fail\r\nto undergo some change, in consequence of the particles of dust that the\r\ninsects would introduce into it.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed the flame of a spirit-lamp quickly over the\r\nindia-rubber tube, the glass stopper, the curved tube, and even over the\r\nfingers of the operator, we may withdraw the glass stopper, and\r\nintroduce the pure yeast by means of a glass pipette that has been\r\npreviously heated. This yeast is kept in a vessel also free from the\r\ndust floating in the air. However few globules of yeast the glass tube\r\nmay take up, it is sure to introduce a hundred or a thousand times more\r\nthan is necessary for the impregnation of the liquid. The glass stopper\r\nmust then be replaced immediately, after having been again quickly\r\npassed through the flame. In transferring our yeast from the vessel\r\ncontaining it to the flask, by means of a glass pipette, it is exposed\r\nto another cause of impurity, since we cannot avoid bringing it in\r\ncontact with the common air. If this risk frequently troubled us in our\r\nexperiments, we might banish it or minimize it by some new arrangement;\r\nbut this is unnecessary. We have suffered no inconvenience from this\r\ncause, as there does not exist in the atmosphere anything like a\r\ncontinuous supply of that from which the so-called _spontaneous_\r\ngeneration arises, as was erroneously believed to be the case before the\r\npublication of our Memoir in 1862, to which we have already alluded.\r\n\r\nThe following are the results of the experiments conducted in the manner\r\njust described.\r\n\r\nThe yeast which we sowed, in ever so small a quantity, seemed to acquire\r\nvigour, to bud, and to multiply. Soon, that is to say in the course of\r\ntwenty-four or forty-eight hours or longer, according to the\r\ntemperature, and, more especially, the degree of vitality in the\r\nglobules, we found that the sides of our flasks were covered with a\r\nwhite yeasty deposit, and noticed on the surface of the liquid a fine\r\nfroth, which at first appeared like little islets formed by groups of\r\nbubbles so minute that they would have been imperceptible had they not\r\nbeen joined together. These patches increased in size, and gradually\r\nattached themselves to each other, finally forming a thick froth. In the\r\ncourse of two or three days this froth fell, the fermentation proceeded\r\nless rapidly, and then ceased completely. The beer was finished. This\r\nbeer might be preserved for an indefinite period in the flask without\r\nundergoing any change. The external air passes freely into and out of\r\nthe flask, as the pressure of the atmosphere and the temperature vary,\r\nand the beer in the course of time becomes flat; it acquires age in much\r\nthe same manner as wine does, but it never contracts any taste of\r\ndisease, it never becomes sour, or sharp, or bitter, or putrid; it does\r\nnot even become covered with _mycoderma vini_ as is usually the case\r\nwith all beer exposed to the common air in the course of trade.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks, or perhaps months, a white ring may show itself on the\r\nsurface of the liquid on the glass. This is a crown formed by a mass of\r\nyoung yeast globules, which grow there like a mould, by absorbing the\r\noxygen of the air as it enters the flask. The bulk of the yeast which\r\nhas been fermenting remains at the bottom of the liquid in the form of\r\nan inert deposit. This inertness, however, is apparent rather than real;\r\nthe globules may be internally active, without any development of new\r\nbuds, and the effects of this working may cause them to become more and\r\nmore languid, and in the course of time may even destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe case is quite different when the yeast with which our wort is\r\nimpregnated, instead of being pure, is mixed to any extent whatsoever\r\nwith diseased ferments. Should there be any of these in the yeast with\r\nwhich we impregnate our wort, even though their quantity were so\r\ninfinitesimal that the most skilful observer could scarcely discover\r\nthem with the microscope, they would multiply in the flask after the\r\nbeer had been finished, especially if the beer were left for a short\r\ntime on a stove. In this manner we may secure an excellent test of the\r\noriginal purity of the yeast which we employ in the impregnation of our\r\nwort.\r\n\r\nThus it may be seen that the absence of microscopic organisms that are\r\nforeign to the nature of pure yeast may invariably be noticed in the\r\ncase of a beer which is sound, and which will remain sound for any\r\nlength of time, when in contact with pure air, at any temperature. We\r\nmay see, too, that the presence of these organisms may invariably be\r\ndetected in an unsound beer, the peculiar unsoundness of which depends\r\nupon the peculiar species of the organisms contained in it. It would be\r\ndifficult to adduce clearer proofs than those which we have given as to\r\nthe intimate relation existing between these organisms and the\r\ndeterioration of beer. The relation between cause and effect, in the\r\nsuccession of physical phenomena in general, is established by proofs\r\nthat are by no means more decisive.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  A statement of this proposition, as far as it concerns beer, appeared\r\n  first in outline in the author’s _Etudes sur le vin_, published in\r\n  1866.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  As the deposit in the heated bottles is, as a rule, inconsiderable, it\r\n  is necessary to exercise some precaution in collecting it. The bottles\r\n  are taken up; after some days’ rest they are decanted very carefully,\r\n  with as little shaking as possible, until not more than one or two\r\n  cubic centimetres (about a tea-spoonful) of the liquid remains at the\r\n  bottom. The bottles are then shaken vigorously, with the object of\r\n  collecting the whole of the deposit from the bottom and the sides into\r\n  this small quantity of liquid; a drop of this is then examined under\r\n  the microscope.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Since the publication of the author’s “Studies on the Diseases of\r\n  Wine, and the Dangers resulting to Wine and Beer from the Microscopic\r\n  Parasites found therein,” some intelligent brewers have derived\r\n  considerable profit from the application of the theories laid down in\r\n  that work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  If we put a handful of germinating barley from a maltster’s cistern\r\n  into a little water, and examine drops of the liquid, after it has\r\n  become turbid, under a microscope, we shall be amazed at the wonderful\r\n  number of strange microscopic organisms that swarm on the surface of\r\n  the grains and on the sides of the cistern. There is no doubt that\r\n  their presence is injurious to germination, inasmuch as they absorb\r\n  much oxygen; moreover, they acidify the grain and cause it to\r\n  deteriorate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  In these experiments the asbestos is only introduced by way of extra\r\n  precaution. Originally, in his early experiments in connection with\r\n  the subject of spontaneous generation, the results of which were\r\n  published in 1860-62, the author did not use it, and he observed no\r\n  ill effects resulting from the omission; now, however, he constantly\r\n  makes use of it. In studies of this kind novel precautions are never\r\n  thrown away; moreover, the presence of this asbestos is a sure bar to\r\n  the entrance of insects. The author has preserved for a long time a\r\n  flask, in the slender neck of which an insect is contained; he killed\r\n  it with a flame just as it was approaching the liquid. Quite recently,\r\n  M. Calmettes, a young engineer from the École Centrale, when engaged,\r\n  at Tantonville, in Tourtel’s brewery, in carrying out certain\r\n  practical experiments in connection with the process that will he\r\n  described in one of the later chapters of this work, wrote complaining\r\n  that his flasks had been suddenly invaded by a swarm of aphides,\r\n  scarcely larger than phylloxeras, and that many of them had even\r\n  penetrated into the inside of the curved tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n             On the Origin of Ferments properly so called.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new process of brewing, which it is the principal object of this\r\nwork to explain, and which will follow as an immediate and inevitable\r\ndeduction from the novel facts herein demonstrated, cannot be fully\r\nunderstood without a knowledge of all the principles upon which it is\r\nfounded. One of the most essential of these has reference to the purity\r\nof our fermentation. We should gain but little from the use of a yeast\r\nuncontaminated by any foreign germs if natural organic substances had\r\nthe power of organizing themselves by means of spontaneous generation,\r\nor by some transformation which took place amongst them, or even by a\r\nconversion of certain microscopic beings into certain others. Theories\r\nof this kind are still warmly advocated, but, to our thinking, rather\r\nfrom sentimental considerations or prejudice than from any basis of\r\nserious experimental proofs.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, we must free our minds from all suppositions which\r\nmight qualify the exactness of the principles upon which our new process\r\nis founded, or cause any doubt in the minds of our readers as to the\r\npossibility of its application and the benefits to be derived from its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n   § I.—On the Conditions which cause Variations in the Nature of the\r\n               Organized Products existing in Infusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have proved by experiment, in the preceding chapter, that a few\r\nminutes’ boiling renders liquids, and more especially wort, absolutely\r\nfree from liability to change when in contact with pure air, that is,\r\nair which contains none of the germs of organisms that are continually\r\nfloating about in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in the case of wort is equally so in the case of all\r\norganic liquids; there is not a single one that could not be rendered\r\ninaccessible to any subsequent change if it were brought, first of all,\r\nto a suitable temperature, which would vary with the nature of the\r\nliquids. Amongst them there are some which, like vinegar, lose their\r\ntendency to change after having been rapidly raised to a temperature of\r\nnot more than 50° C. (122° F.); others, like wine, require a greater\r\nheat. Wort, to which no hops have been added, should be subjected to a\r\ntemperature of not more than 90° C. (194° F.); milk to about 110° C.\r\n(230° F.).[21]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show that these differences in temperature, which are\r\nrequired to secure organic liquids from ultimate change, depend\r\nexclusively upon the state of the liquids, their nature, and, above all,\r\non the conditions that affect their neutrality, whether towards acidity\r\nor alkalinity; for it is not difficult to observe that the least changes\r\nin these respects lead to considerable variations in the temperatures\r\nwhich we must employ.[22] We could adduce many examples of this. The\r\nonly difference between the nature of must and that of wine is caused by\r\nfermentation. We may say the same thing of wort and beer, and, better\r\nstill, of new milk and sour milk. Must, to be secured from change,\r\nrequires a much higher temperature than wine does; similarly, wort\r\nrequires a much higher temperature than beer. Milk must be heated to\r\nabout 110° C. (230° F.), as we have just stated, but sour milk would\r\nrequire 20° C. or 30° C. (36° F. or 54° F.) less. Wine, when fresh,\r\nceases to be liable to change after it has been brought to a temperature\r\nbelow 100° C. (212° F.); it requires a temperature of more than 100° C.\r\nin the presence of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nAs regards the explanation of the influence which acidity or alkalinity\r\nexerts in diminishing or increasing the temperature required to protect\r\ninfusions and organic matters from ultimate change, although this is a\r\nsubject which claims special study, we are inclined to believe that\r\nacidity permits, and alkalinity prevents, the penetration of moisture\r\ninto the interior of the cells of the germs belonging to infusions, so\r\nthat in heating the outer cases of these cells in an alkaline medium we\r\nheat the germs in a dry state; and in heating the outer cases in an acid\r\nmedium we heat the germs when they are moist. We all know that these\r\nconditions make a great difference in the resistance which bodies offer\r\nto the action of heat. A particle of mould which, in a moist state,\r\ncannot survive a temperature of from 60° C. to 100° C. (140° to 212°\r\nF.), will preserve its fecundity even if heated to 120° C. (248° F.), if\r\nit has been previously well dried.[23]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the spontaneous productions which we see appear in organic\r\nliquids is affected to a remarkable extent by the smallest change in the\r\ncompositions of those liquids. Generally speaking, as we have often\r\nproved in our former works, a feeble acidity is unfavourable to the\r\ndevelopment of bacteria and infusoria, and, on the other hand,\r\nfavourable to the growth of mould. A liquid which is neutral or of\r\nfeeble alkalinity behaves in an exactly inverse manner.\r\n\r\nThose who support the theory of spontaneous generation seek to find in\r\nthe natural differences between the organic productions of various\r\nliquids which are simultaneously exposed to the same atmosphere, an\r\nargument in favour of their doctrine. These differences, however, are\r\nonly an effect of the greater or less fitness of a peculiar liquid for a\r\ncertain kind of growth. When an acid organic liquid, such as the must of\r\ngrapes for example, is exposed freely to the air, it is besieged\r\nsimultaneously by spores of _mucedines_, as well as germs of _bacteria_,\r\n_leptothrix_, _vibrios_, _&c._, but the latter germs are checked in\r\ntheir development, if, indeed, they are not actually destroyed, by the\r\nacidity of the liquid; and we should never find them there in their\r\nadult state.\r\n\r\nMost moulds, on the other hand, thrive in acid liquids, and therefore\r\nthey are generally found alone. If we began by saturating must with\r\ncarbonate of lime, previously dried or otherwise, we should observe\r\nopposite phenomena; bacteria, lactic ferments and butyric vibrios would\r\ninvade our fields long before the spores of mould had time to grow,\r\nsince the germination of these proceeds very languidly in neutral or\r\nalkaline liquids, and an infusion once occupied by a living organism has\r\nmuch trouble in nourishing others; the early developments consume the\r\nalimentary substances, especially the oxygen.\r\n\r\nDifferences as marked as these in the adaptability of certain liquids to\r\ncertain growths give rise to innumerable illusions, and are one of the\r\nchief sources of error in the study of this subject. If we sow in an\r\nacid liquid, such as must, an alcoholic ferment, the development of\r\nwhich is not arrested by the acid character of our medium, it will\r\nmultiply there, and we shall have no difficulty in growing it over and\r\nover again in the same acid medium. This being the case, let us suppose\r\nthat our alcoholic ferment is impure—let us say, mixed with filaments of\r\nturned wine, which are due to a ferment checked in its development by\r\nthe peculiar qualities of the must. In repeating the growth of this\r\nalcoholic ferment in the must the filaments which were, by supposition,\r\npresent in our first sowing, and which cannot reproduce themselves in\r\nthe must, or do so with great difficulty, will become very scarce in the\r\nfields of our microscope; they will not, however, cease to exist, for\r\nthe repetition of our attempts to grow them only serves to spread the\r\noriginal germs over a larger surface; and, although the eye fails to\r\ndetect them, they will only have become more difficult to discover. At\r\nthis point the experimentalist is in danger of falling into error, for\r\nwhen he no longer perceives the foreign ferment he will be inclined to\r\nbelieve that it has vanished, and that he may regard the alcoholic\r\nferment as being free from all impurity, without testing for the purity\r\nby a direct experiment.\r\n\r\nAn example of this mistake is to be found in a recent work by M. Jules\r\nDuval. This writer has published a theory according to which yeast\r\nbecomes transformed into lactic ferment, and likewise into other\r\nferments—that of urea, for example—the only condition of change,\r\naccording to M. Jules Duval, being that we should cultivate it in\r\nsuitable mediums. The proofs by which he supports his conclusion are\r\naltogether inadmissible, and a simple glance at his experiments enables\r\nus to detect innumerable causes of error. M. Duval believes that yeast\r\nbecomes transformed into lactic ferment from the fact that he obtained a\r\nfermentation which furnished lactate of lime and lactic ferment from\r\nsome sour milk to which he had added some glucose, chalk, and phosphate\r\nof ammonia before impregnating it with yeast; but he took no steps to\r\nsecure himself against introducing into his medium—which was, as a\r\nmatter of fact, well adapted to lactic fermentation, inasmuch as it was\r\na little alkaline—an alcoholic ferment containing impurities. This was\r\nthe crucial point in his experiments. M. Duval recognizes this, but he\r\ndeceives himself when he says, without proof:—“My alcoholic ferment is\r\npure, for I have grown it over and over again in must, preserved in\r\nflasks prepared after the manner of those which M. Pasteur uses in his\r\nexperiments.” Here we have merely a simple assertion; a direct\r\nexperimental test might have proved that the yeast was impure.\r\n\r\nYeast cannot transform itself into lactic ferment. No matter what the\r\nmedium may be in which it is sown, _if it is actually pure_ it will\r\nnever present the least trace of lactic ferment or of any other\r\nferments. By certain changes in the nature of the medium, the\r\ntemperature, and other conditions, the cells of the ferment may become\r\noval, elongated, spherical, and larger or smaller in size, but they will\r\nnever produce the most minute quantity of lactic ferment or lactic acid.\r\nThe whole theory of the transmutation of ferments, which M. Duval has\r\npublished, is imaginary.[24]\r\n\r\nWe have asserted that the source from which we obtain our supply of the\r\nsubstances that we expose to contact with the air may likewise furnish a\r\nreason for the development of vegetable or animal organisms which make\r\ntheir appearance in our infusions. This may be easily understood. If we\r\nexpose the infusions to temperatures more or less high, with the object\r\nof destroying the vitality of the germs which they may contain, we\r\ncompletely suppress all germs originating from two different\r\nsources—those which the infusions may have acquired directly from the\r\natmospheric air, or from the dust upon our utensils, and those which may\r\nhave been introduced by the materials used in manufacturing our\r\ninfusions or decoctions, which materials must have been brought from\r\nsome distance. An infusion, after having been heated to a sufficient\r\ndegree, can harbour and nourish only such germs as are conveyed to it by\r\nthe air after the heating. These floating germs are far from being as\r\nvaried in their nature as it pleases those to believe who are tied down\r\nby their arbitrary and faulty interpretation of the knowledge that we\r\nhave acquired, and the discussions in which we have taken part, during\r\nthe last fifteen years. Air, unless in violent agitation, can hold only\r\nthe most minute particles in suspension. The observations which have\r\nbeen recorded concerning organisms of spontaneous growth found in\r\ninfusions, have always been made in sheltered places—in rooms or\r\nlaboratories, the atmosphere of which is, relatively speaking, very\r\nstill. For this reason, in liquids that have been subjected to heat, the\r\n_flora_ and _fauna_—if we may use such an expression—are very poor, and\r\nall the more so because, as we have recently had occasion to remark, a\r\ngreat number of the organisms which would spring into existence of their\r\nown accord, if they were allowed sufficient time for germination, are\r\nkept back by others of a more rapid development. The truth of this is\r\nevident from the fact that we may observe greater variations in the\r\nnature and number of species of living organisms, if we divide one\r\ninfusion amongst several vessels which are immediately closed up again,\r\nthan if we leave our infusion in contact with an unlimited volume of\r\nsurrounding air. By this means we expose each portion of the liquid to\r\nno other germs than those existing in a state of suspension in the\r\nvolume of air introduced into the vessels; and it so frequently happens\r\nthat we obtain a variety of germs which, coming into contact with a\r\nliquid adapted to their nutrition, without having mixed with others,\r\nfinally multiply there, in consequence of no other organisms of greater\r\nactivity occurring to impede their slow and laborious propagation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the products resulting from raw infusions—that is, those\r\nobtained, without heating, from the maceration of organic substances,\r\nsuch as leaves, fruits, grains, or the organs of plants or animals—is\r\nmuch more varied. The reason of this is that such substances generally\r\ncarry with them not only the particles of dust existing in air that is\r\nin motion, but also microscopic parasites, which find a congenial\r\nresting-place on their surface or its vicinity. We may cite a few\r\naccurate observations on this point, for the subject is one of great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIf we boil an infusion of hay, and then expose it to contact with the\r\nair in a room, all its productions will be derived from such germs as a\r\ncomparatively still air can carry about; thus, we shall very rarely find\r\nany _colpoda_ in our infusion, for the germs of these infusoria,\r\nconsisting of rather large cells, can scarcely exist in a state of\r\nsuspension in motionless air, in spite of their extraordinary diffusion\r\nin nature. On the other hand, we almost invariably find _colpoda_ in\r\nmacerations of raw hay. This difference is easily accounted for; the\r\nparticles of dust adhering to the surface of hay, especially that which\r\ncomes from marshy districts, contain the germ-cells of _colpoda_ in\r\nabundance. The reason is obvious; rain falls on a meadow and forms\r\nlittle pools of water about the roots of the herbs that grow there; this\r\nwater remains for some time, and very soon swarms with a multitude of\r\ninfusoria, especially _colpoda_. Dryness follows; the _colpoda_ becomes\r\nencysted, and forms a dust that is wafted by the winds on to the blades\r\nof grass, so that the mower will carry away not only his hay, but also\r\nmyriads of _colpoda_, as well as spores of _mucedines_ and other\r\norganisms.[25]\r\n\r\nThe maceration of pepper will give us some infusoria hardly ever found\r\nin other infusions, the reason of this being that such infusoria exist\r\nwhere the pepper grows—in other words, their germs are exotic. That the\r\ninfusion of a special plant should give us special infusoria, is\r\nscarcely more surprising than the discovery of a particular parasite or\r\ninsect existing on a particular plant, and not on others of a different\r\nspecies that grow near it. Thus it happens that the ferment-germs of\r\nmust exist on the surface of grapes, whether detached or in clusters. It\r\nis only natural that we should find the organ or the plant that is\r\ndestined later on to become the food of a parasite serving as a\r\nhabitation for the germs of that parasite.\r\n\r\n\r\n § II.—Experiments on Blood and Urine taken in their Normal State, and\r\n Exposed to Contact with Air that has been Deprived of the Particles of\r\n              Dust which it Generally holds in Suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecourse to the application of heat, in the first place, is an excellent\r\nmeans, as we have just seen, of procuring organic liquids free from all\r\ndisturbing germs; but there is a still more remarkable and instructive,\r\nwe may even say more unlooked for, method of securing this result, which\r\nmay be described as in some measure borrowed from the nature of things.\r\nIt consists in seeking purity in the natural liquids of animals and\r\nplants. It is difficult to understand how the liquids circulating in the\r\norgans of animal bodies, such as blood, urine, milk, amniotic fluid, and\r\nso on, can possibly secrete the germs of microscopic organisms. There\r\nwould be excellent opportunities for these germs to propagate themselves\r\nif they actually did exist in the liquids appertaining to the animal\r\neconomy. Life in all probability would become impossible in the presence\r\nof such guests. A proof of this is to be found in the multitude of\r\ndiseases which many of the greatest minds of modern times attribute to\r\nparasitic developments of this nature. Medical men of high authority\r\nagree in thinking that the questions of contagion and infection will\r\nfind solutions from the obscurity in which they are now involved in a\r\ncareful study of ferments, and that hygienists and physicians should\r\nlabour to secure by every possible means the destruction of the germs of\r\nferments, and should strive to check _their_ development, and prevent\r\nthe evils which _they_ cause when developed. Great progress has already\r\nbeen made in this direction, and we deem it a signal honour that our\r\nresearches on the subject have been considered, even by those by whom\r\nthis progress has been accomplished, as the source from which they\r\nderived their first inspirations. We shall, doubtless, be excused by our\r\nreaders if we recall this fact in relating certain historical details\r\nwhich are especially necessary in order that they may comprehend the\r\nprinciples that we are endeavouring to explain in these “studies.”\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret to us, however, that the facts which we have\r\nestablished should have been accredited with any importance beyond that\r\nwhich is their due. The exaggeration of novel ideas invariably leads to\r\na reaction, which, again, overshooting the mark, brings into disrepute\r\neven those points in which such ideas are perfectly just, or, at all\r\nevents, worthy of serious consideration. There are certain symptoms of\r\nsuch a reaction in the case of our theories: they are evident in the\r\ntendency of unreflecting minds to give a total denial to the fact that\r\ncertain diseases may be derived from certain ferments—organized and\r\nliving ferments—of the nature of those which have been discovered in the\r\ncourse of the last twenty years. We should be guided by facts, whichever\r\nside of the question we espouse, and by facts alone we should test the\r\ntruth of doubtful discoveries. We are but on the threshold of the\r\nexploration of our subject, and we should strive to discover new facts\r\nin connection with it, and should deduce from these, whatever they may\r\nbe, only such conclusions as they may strictly warrant. Unfortunately,\r\nthere is amongst physicians a tendency to generalize by anticipation.\r\nMany of them are men of rare natural or acquired talent, endowed with\r\nkeen powers of intellect, and the art of expressing themselves fluently\r\nand persuasively; but the more eminent they are, the more they are\r\noccupied by the duties of their profession, and the less leisure they\r\nhave for the work of investigation. Urged on by that thirst for\r\nknowledge which belongs to superior minds, and perhaps, in some measure,\r\nthrough associating with the upper classes of society, which are\r\nbecoming more and more interested in science, they eagerly seize upon\r\neasy and plausible theories, readily adapted for statement which is\r\ngeneral and vague just in proportion to the unsoundness of the facts on\r\nwhich they are based. When we see beer and wine undergo radical changes,\r\nin consequence of the harbour which those liquids afford to microscopic\r\norganisms that introduce themselves invisibly and unsought into it, and\r\nswarm subsequently therein, how can we help imagining that similar\r\nchanges may and do take place in the case of man and animals? Should we,\r\nhowever, be disposed to think that such a thing must hold true, because\r\nit seems both probable and possible, we must, before asserting our\r\nbelief, recall to mind the epigraph of this work: _the greatest\r\naberration of the mind is to believe a thing to be, because we desire\r\nit_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished members of the Academy of Medicine, M.\r\nDavainne, who was the first to give his attention to rigorous\r\nexperiments on the influence that organic ferments exercise on the\r\nproduction and propagation of infectious diseases, declares that the\r\nidea of his researches on _splenic fever_ and _malignant pustule_ was\r\nsuggested to him by his perusal of our work on butyric fermentation,\r\npublished in 1861. In 1850 this gentleman and M. Rayer discovered in the\r\nblood of animals attacked by these diseases minute filiform bodies, to\r\nwhich they paid little attention, and which M. Davainne recollected,\r\nwhen he came across our Memoir. He had the foresight to conjecture—a\r\nconjecture that was soon confirmed most decisively by his\r\nresearches—that the former disease, known under the name of _sang de\r\nrate_, might be the production of a fermentation analogous to the\r\nbutyric, in which the minute filiform bodies observed by Rayer and\r\nhimself, in 1850, played the part which vibrios fill in butyric\r\nfermentation. Within two years of this the first works of Messrs. Coze\r\nand Feltz appeared. These clever and courageous experimentalists avowed\r\nthat their beautiful researches had been suggested to them by the\r\nperusal of my work on putrefaction, published in 1863. We might also\r\nquote the striking and admirably conceived experiments of Dr. Chauveau,\r\non castration.[26] We cannot, however, refrain from reproducing here a\r\nletter addressed to us in 1874 by the celebrated Edinburgh surgeon, Mr.\r\nLister:—\r\n\r\n    “Edinburgh, Feb. 10, 1874.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,—Will you permit me to beg your acceptance of a pamphlet\r\n    which I forward to you by this post, and which describes certain\r\n    inquiries into a subject upon which you have thrown so much\r\n    light—the theory of germs and fermentation? It gives me pleasure to\r\n    think that you will peruse with some interest what I have written\r\n    about an organism that you were the first to study in your Memoir on\r\n    lactic fermentation. I do not know if you ever see the records of\r\n    British surgery. If you have perused them you may have observed from\r\n    time to time notices of the antiseptic system which I have been\r\n    endeavouring for the last nine years to bring to perfection. Permit\r\n    me to take this opportunity of offering you my most hearty thanks\r\n    for having demonstrated by your brilliant researches the truth of\r\n    the theory of putrefactive germs, and for having afforded me in this\r\n    manner the sole means of perfecting the antiseptic system.\r\n\r\n    “Should you ever come to Edinburgh I am sure that you will be truly\r\n    gratified to see in our hospital the extent to which the human race\r\n    has profited by your work. I need hardly add, that I should have\r\n    great satisfaction in showing you how greatly surgery is indebted to\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    “Excuse the freedom which I have taken in addressing you, on the\r\n    grounds of our common love for science, and believe in the profound\r\n    esteem of yours, very sincerely, JOSEPH LISTER.”\r\n\r\nThe wad dressing of Dr. Alphonse Guérin, surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu,\r\nParis, which has already rendered great assistance to surgery, and has\r\nbeen the subject of a very favourable report at the Academy of Sciences\r\nin Paris, was invented by its author in consequence of certain\r\nreflections suggested to him by the perusal of our researches. The\r\ncommission which framed the report made, through M. Gosselin, some wise\r\nreservations in the case of certain theoretical ideas which M. Guérin\r\nhad not sufficiently proved by experiment. We have no doubt, however,\r\nthat when the matter is thoroughly examined, facts will confirm the\r\ntruth of the wide views entertained by the surgeon of the Hôtel-Dieu.\r\n\r\nDr. Déclat has founded quite a new system for the treatment of\r\ninfectious diseases, which is based upon the use of one of the best\r\nknown antiseptics, phenic acid. His theory, which he affirms was\r\nsuggested to him by our studies on fermentations, is, that the diseases\r\nwhich transmit themselves are, each of them, the product of a special\r\nferment, and that both medical and surgical professors of therapeutics\r\nshould make it their study to prevent exterior ferments from penetrating\r\ninto the liquids of our economy, or in the event of these ferments\r\nhaving found their way into the system, to discover _antiferments_ for\r\ntheir destruction, without effecting any change in the vitality of the\r\nhistological elements of the liquid or tissues.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that extreme caution must be exercised in dealing with\r\nquestions of this kind, as M. Sédillot has authoritatively remarked; but\r\nat the same time it cannot be denied that the more such questions are\r\ndiscussed with exactness, the more those celebrated practitioners who\r\noriginated them are confirmed in the ideas which first guided them. We\r\nmay give another example of this.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, in consequence of a communication addressed to the Academy of\r\nSciences by Messrs Gosselin and A. Robin, on the subject of ammoniacal\r\nurine, we made the observation that we should endeavour to ascertain if,\r\nin all such cases, the urinary fluids were not rendered ammoniacal by\r\nthe presence of the little ferment of the urea, which we have previously\r\nnoticed,[27] and which has since then been discussed with remarkable\r\nintelligence by M. Van Tieghem, in the thesis which he maintained for\r\nhis doctor’s degree. The suggestion and the considerations that\r\njustified it led to a discussion before the Academy of Medicine, in\r\nwhich contrary opinions were maintained. We lost no time in submitting\r\nthese to the test of facts. We could not find a single person suffering\r\nfrom ammoniacal urine, in whose case the little ferment which we\r\nmentioned was not to be detected. Our predictions were thus completely\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1864 the _Gazette Hebdomadaire de Médecine et de Chirurgie_\r\npublished an account of urine made ammoniacal in the bladder, the author\r\nof which, Dr. Traube, makes the following observations:—“It was believed\r\nthat, in consequence of the retention of the liquid, and the resulting\r\ndistension of the bladder, that organ became irritated and produced a\r\nlarger quantity of mucus, and that this mucus was the ferment which\r\ncaused the decomposition of the urea, by virtue of a chemical action\r\npeculiar to itself. This belief can no longer be held in presence of M.\r\nPasteur’s discoveries. This observer has demonstrated, in the most\r\nconclusive manner, that ammoniacal fermentation, like alcoholic and\r\nacetic, is produced by living beings, whose pre-existence in the\r\nfermentable liquid is a necessary condition of the process. The\r\npreceding fact offers a remarkable proof of M. Pasteur’s theory. In\r\nspite of the long duration of the retention, alkaline fermentation was\r\nnot produced by an excessive secretion of the vesical mucus or of pus:\r\nit only began from the moment when the germs of vibrios passed from the\r\noutside into the bladder.”[28]\r\n\r\nFinally, we may conclude with perfect truth that the liquids of our\r\neconomy, blood and urine, for instance, may afford a harbour to\r\ndifferent ferments, even in the inmost parts of the organs, when\r\nexternal causes enable such ferments to find their way into those\r\nliquids, and that diseases of greater or less gravity result from this\r\ncause. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the bodies of animals\r\nin a state of health afford no means of entrance to these external\r\ngerms. At the same time, direct experiment alone can convince the mind\r\nas to the truth of this latter assertion. Let us take some of the\r\nsubstances that are to be found inside living animals in perfect health,\r\nand expose them, in the same condition in which life has formed them, to\r\ncontact with pure air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose we must provide ourselves with a glass flask, joined to\r\na copper tap by means of an india-rubber tube, as shown in Fig. 5. The\r\ntwo branches of the tap should be about twelve centimetres long (about\r\n½-in.), the one which is free tapering off like the end of a pipe. In\r\norder to destroy all germs which may exist in the flask, we must join\r\nthe free end of the copper tube to a platinum tube kept at a very high\r\ntemperature, after having carefully introduced into the flask a small\r\nquantity of water, and expelled all the air by converting the water into\r\nsteam. Then as we allow the flask to cool, the air which re-enters it\r\nwill necessarily pass through the hot tube (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nWe may cause the water in the flask to boil at a temperature of more\r\nthan 100° C. (212° F.) by fitting to the free end of the platinum tube a\r\nglass tube bent at right angles, which we plunge to any depth in a deep\r\nvessel filled with mercury (Fig. 7). Whilst the water is boiling under\r\npressure, we must separate the tube which is plunged in the mercury; the\r\nwater in the flask will continue to boil at the ordinary pressure. We\r\nmust then leave the flask to cool. It will gradually become filled with\r\nair that has been heated to a high temperature, more than sufficient to\r\nburn up all the organic particles of dust which that air could have\r\ncontained. When the flask is cold we must close the tap and detach it,\r\nand proceed to prepare other similar flasks. It will be advisable to\r\nclose the tap when the temperature of the flask is still a few degrees\r\nabove that of the surrounding atmosphere: this precaution will cause the\r\nair in the cooled flask to have a lower pressure than that of the\r\nexternal atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval which must elapse between the preparation and the\r\nuse of a flask, it is a good thing to keep the free branch of the tap\r\ninclined towards the ground, to secure the inside of its tube from the\r\ndeposit of external particles of dust. Whether this precaution be\r\nadopted or not, we must take care to heat this branch in the flame of a\r\nspirit lamp just before we bring our flask into requisition.\r\n\r\nIf we have to study blood, we must take it from a living animal—a dog,\r\nfor example. We must expose a vein or an artery of the animal, and make\r\nan incision into which the end of the free tap-branch, which has\r\npreviously been heated and allowed to cool, must be introduced and fixed\r\nby a ligature in the vein or artery. On opening the tap, the blood will\r\nrush into the flask; it must then be closed, and the flask placed in an\r\noven at a certain temperature. We have successfully accomplished these\r\nmanipulations, thanks to the kind help of our illustrious colleague and\r\nfriend, M. Claude Bernard.\r\n\r\nThe operation is nearly the same in the case of urine. The end of the\r\nfree branch of the tap is introduced into the passage of the urethra;\r\nthe tap is turned at the moment when the urine is emitted, which is then\r\nallowed to pass into the flask, until it is a third or half filled.\r\n\r\nThe following were the results of our experiments:—Blood underwent no\r\nputrefactive change even at the highest temperatures of the atmosphere,\r\nbut retained the odour of fresh blood, or acquired the smell of lye.\r\nContrary to what we might have expected, the direct oxidation of the\r\nconstituents of blood by slow combustion was rather sluggish. After\r\nsubjecting our flasks to a temperature of 25° C. or 30° C. (77° F. to\r\n80° F.) in an oven for several weeks, we observed an absorption of not\r\nmore than 2 or 3 per cent. of oxygen, which was replaced by a volume of\r\ncarbonic acid gas of about an equal bulk.[29]\r\n\r\nNearly the same results were obtained in the case of urine; it underwent\r\nno radical change; its colour merely assumed a reddish brown tint; it\r\nformed some small deposits of crystals, but without becoming at all\r\nturbid or putrefying in any way. The direct oxidation of the urinary\r\nsubstances was likewise very sluggish. An analysis of the air in one of\r\nthe flasks, made forty days after the commencement of the experiment,\r\ngave the following results:—\r\n\r\n                      Oxygen                 19·2\r\n                      Carbonic acid           0·8\r\n                      Nitrogen               80·0\r\n                                              ——-\r\n                                            100·0\r\n\r\nThese experiments on blood and urine which we have just mentioned date\r\nfrom 1863.[30] Ten years afterwards, in 1873, they were confirmed in an\r\nimportant and striking manner by the results of a very able series of\r\nexperiments, which were carried out in our laboratory, by M. Gayon, who\r\nwas formerly a pupil in the _École Normale Supérieure_. M. Gayon proved\r\nthat what held good in the case of blood and urine, also held good in\r\nthe case of the substances contained in eggs. He found that the whites\r\nof eggs might be exposed for any length of time to contact with air, as\r\nalso might the yolks, or the white and yolks mixed, without any\r\nputrefactive change or fermentation resulting, and without the smallest\r\nmicroscopic germ showing itself, the sole condition being that the air\r\nmust be freed from all organic particles of dust, germs of mould,\r\n_bacteria_, _vibrios_, and other organisms which it holds in suspension.\r\nThis was only a part of the important facts brought to light by M.\r\nGayon. Amongst other things, he proved that spontaneous putrefaction in\r\neggs is invariably caused by the development of organized ferments,\r\nthereby correcting the opposite statements announced by M. Donné and M.\r\nBéchamp, who were led by their observations to believe that the change\r\nin eggs took place quite independently of the action of _vibrios_ and\r\n_mucedines_.[31]\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to remark how greatly the results of these\r\nexperiments on blood, urine, and the components of the egg are opposed\r\nto the doctrine of spontaneous generation, as also to most modern\r\ntheories on the generation of ferments. As long as experiments relating\r\nto the question of so-called _spontaneous_ generation were made on\r\nheated substances, the advocates of _heterogenesis_ had some grounds for\r\nasserting that such materials could not satisfy the conditions of\r\nspontaneous life, and that we should obtain different results by using\r\nnatural organic liquids, which, if exposed to contact of pure air would\r\ndoubtless serve for the production of new beings which did not issue\r\nfrom parents which resembled them. This novel enunciation of the\r\nhypothesis of spontaneous generation, the only one, we think, that could\r\nbe defended after the publication of our Memoir, in 1862, is condemned\r\nby the preceding facts.\r\n\r\nThe same facts completely upset the hypothesis recently maintained by\r\nMessrs. Fremy and Trécul on the subject of the causes of fermentation.\r\n\r\n“Side by side with the immediate, definite principles which may be\r\nformed by synthesis,” says M. Fremy, “such as glucose, oxalic acid, and\r\nurea, other substances of greatly inferior stability exist, the\r\nconstitution of which is considerably more complicated, containing all\r\nthe elements of living organs, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, and even phosphorus and sulphur; and often salts of lime and\r\nof the alkalies besides. These bodies are albumen, fibrin, casein, the\r\ncongeners of vitellin and others. Chemical synthesis cannot reproduce\r\nthem. It is impossible, in my opinion, to regard them as immediate,\r\ndefinite principles. I designate them by the general name of\r\n_semi-organized_ bodies, because they hold an intermediate place between\r\nthe immediate principle and the organized tissue.\r\n\r\n“These semi-organized bodies, which contain all the elements of organs,\r\nhave the power, like a dry seed-grain, of existing in a state of organic\r\nimmobility, and of becoming active under circumstances which favour\r\norganic development. By reason of the vital energy that they possess\r\nthey undergo a succession of decompositions, giving origin to new\r\nderivatives, and to the advent of ferments, not by any process of\r\n_spontaneous generation_, but by a _vital energy_, which pre-exists in\r\nthe semi-organized bodies, and is simply carried on, when this energy\r\nmanifests itself, in these most varied organic changes.”\r\n\r\nAfter having expressed these hypothetical and confused opinions, M.\r\nFremy continues:—“I do not consider, then, that these semi-organized\r\nbodies serve merely as nourishment for certain animal and vegetable\r\norganisms, which may be the sole agents of fermentations, but I give\r\nthem a direct _rôle_ and admit that, under the influences which I have\r\nalready cited[32] they may assume a real and complete organization, and\r\nproduce ferments which are not derived, as we have seen, from a germ or\r\nan ovum but from a semi-organized body, the vital energy of which has\r\nbecome active.[33] It will be seen that these opinions are quite\r\ndifferent from those which M. Pasteur has maintained in his works, since\r\nthey attribute the origin of alcoholic and lactic ferments to an\r\nalbuminous substance. Taking the case of alcoholic fermentation alone, I\r\nassert that, in the production of wine, it is the juice of the grape\r\nitself which, in contact with air, produces grains of yeast, by the\r\ntransformation of the albuminous substances. M. Pasteur, on the\r\ncontrary, maintains that the grains of yeast are produced by certain\r\ngerms.”[34]\r\n\r\nWe have combated these propositions, so extraordinary and unsupported by\r\nany rigorous experiments, before the Academy of Sciences, where they\r\nwere first enunciated. On that occasion we related the facts in\r\nconnection with blood and urine, which we have just discussed. Could\r\nthere be any more forcible argument against the theory of our honourable\r\ncolleague than those facts? Here we had natural albuminous substances,\r\nforming part of matter eminently liable to putrefactive change and\r\nfermentation, which produced no ferments of any sort whatsoever when\r\nbrought into contact with air deprived of its organic particles of dust.\r\n\r\nUnder no known circumstances is albuminous matter transformed into\r\ngrains of yeast or any other organized ferment, and, to our thinking,\r\nnothing can be more chimerical than the gratuitous hypothesis of\r\n_hemi-organism_.\r\n\r\nWe shall proceed to new proofs of this, dealing this time with a liquid\r\nformed by the life of a vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n          § III.—Experiments on the Juice contained in Grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussion which took place, at the Academy, on the\r\nsubject of the generation of ferments, properly so called, much was said\r\nabout the oldest known fermentation, that of wine. We at once resolved\r\nto demolish M. Fremy’s theory, by a decisive experiment on the juice of\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nWe prepared forty flasks, capable of holding from 250 c.c. to 300 c.c.\r\n(from 9 to 11 fl. oz.) and shaped as represented in Fig. 8. These we\r\nfilled with filtered must, which was perfectly bright, and which, like\r\nall acid liquids, would remain sound, after having been boiled for a few\r\nseconds, although the ends of the long curved necks of the flasks\r\ncontaining the must might remain constantly open for months or years.\r\n\r\nWe washed, in a few cubic centimetres of water, part of a bunch of\r\ngrapes, washing the grapes separately, or the grapes and the wood\r\ntogether, or even the wood of the bunch alone. This washing was easily\r\naccomplished by means of a perfectly clean badger’s-hair brush, the\r\nwater receiving all the particles of dust adhering to the surface of the\r\ngrapes and the wood of the bunch. By means of a microscope we easily\r\nproved that this water held in suspension an infinite number of\r\norganized corpuscles, some of them bearing a very close resemblance to\r\nthe spores of fungoid growths, others to alcoholic ferment, others to\r\n_mycoderma vini_, and so on.[35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nWe next proceeded to put on one side ten of our forty flasks, to serve\r\nfor subsequent corroboration; in ten others, by means of the tube which\r\nis represented on the right hand side of the flask (Fig. 8), we put a\r\nfew drops of the water in which the bunch of grapes had been washed; in\r\na third series of ten flasks we put a few drops of the same liquid,\r\nafter having previously boiled it. Lastly, we introduced into the ten\r\nremaining flasks a drop of grape-juice, taken from the inside of an\r\nuninjured grape. To do this we had to bend the right-hand tube of each\r\nof our last ten flasks, drawing it out to a fine point and closing it in\r\nthe flame, as represented in Fig. 9 A. This fine closed point was filed\r\nround near its extremity and then thrust, as represented in Fig. 9 B,\r\ninto a grape placed on a hard substance; when the point _b_ was felt to\r\ntouch the substance supporting the grape it was broken off by a slight\r\npressure sideways at the point _a_, where the file marks had been made.\r\nWe had taken care to secure a slight vacuum in the flask beforehand;\r\nthis now caused a drop of the juice to be drawn into the flask. We then\r\ndrew out the fine point, and closed it immediately in the flame of a\r\nspirit lamp. The vacuum was produced by heating the flasks in our hands,\r\nor over the flame of a lamp, thus causing a little air to be forced out\r\nthrough the end of the bent tube, which we then closed up with the lamp.\r\nWhen the flask was cool, the slight difference of pressure sufficed to\r\nforce into it some of the juice contained in the grape, as we have just\r\ndescribed. The drop of juice that is sucked into the flask generally\r\nremains in the curved part of the fine tube; to mix it with the must we\r\nmust incline the flask so as to bring the must in contact with the drop;\r\nafter that we may replace the flask in its natural position.\r\n\r\nThe following are the results presented by our four series of\r\ncomparative experiments in the different cases. The first ten flasks—our\r\nstandard flasks, containing must boiled in contact with pure air—showed\r\nno signs of organized products; the must might have remained in them for\r\nany number of years without change. Our second series of flasks, which\r\ncontained the water in which the grapes, separately and in bunch, had\r\nbeen washed, had undergone alcoholic fermentation in every instance;\r\nthis had manifested itself in all the flasks in the course of about\r\nforty-eight hours, the temperature being at about summer heat. At the\r\nsame time that the yeast made its appearance in the form of little white\r\nlines, which gradually joining together formed a deposit on the sides of\r\nthe flask, we perceived minute flakes of _mycelium_ forming; sometimes\r\nas a single fungoid growth, sometimes combined with another, or with\r\nmany together—these growths being quite independent otherwise of the\r\nyeast or alcoholic ferment. In several cases, too, _mycoderma vini_\r\nshowed itself on the surface of the liquid in the course of a few days.\r\n_Vibrios_ and lactic ferments, properly so called, could not make their\r\nappearance, on account of the nature of the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe flasks of our third series, containing the water in which the bunch\r\nof grapes had been washed, and which we boiled before our experiment,\r\nremained as free from change as the flasks of our first series had done.\r\n\r\nLastly, our fourth series of flasks, containing the drops of juice taken\r\nfrom inside the grapes, remained equally free from change, although we\r\ncould not be certain of having removed, in every case, without\r\nexception, all causes of error which must inevitably occur sometimes in\r\nso delicate an experiment.\r\n\r\nThese experiments cannot leave the least doubt on our minds:\r\n\r\nThat must, if boiled, will never ferment when in contact with air that\r\nhas been freed from the germs which exist in it in a state of\r\nsuspension.\r\n\r\nThat must may be fermented, after boiling, by introducing into it a very\r\nsmall quantity of water, in which a bunch of grapes has been washed.\r\n\r\nThat must will not ferment if we introduce into it some of this same\r\nwater which has been boiled and afterwards cooled.\r\n\r\nThat must will not ferment if we introduce into it a small quantity of\r\nthe juice contained in a grape.[36]\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that the ferment which causes grapes to ferment in the\r\nvintage tub must come from the exterior, and not the interior of the\r\ngrapes. Thus, the hypothesis of MM. Trécul and Fremy, according to which\r\nalbuminous substances transform themselves into grains of yeast by the\r\naction of a peculiar vital force, is annihilated; _à fortiori_, there\r\ncan no longer be a question concerning Liebig’s theory, on the\r\ntransformation of albuminous substances into ferments, by a process of\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\nOur readers may be curious to know what M. Fremy has been able to oppose\r\nto such crucial experiments; they could scarcely have imagined the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n“In my experiments, which I have varied in every possible manner,” says\r\nthat gentleman, “I have found that it is almost impossible to discover\r\nalcoholic fermentation, appreciable by its results, in a single drop of\r\ngrape juice, and I may add that this fermentation must be still more\r\ndifficult to discover when this drop has been drowned in a large\r\nquantity of juice that has been previously boiled.”[37]\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted that we were justified in saying, at the\r\ncommencement of this paragraph, that we should demolish the theory which\r\nwas opposed to ours, and which its advocates have been constrained to\r\ndefend by hypotheses manifestly false.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting following the one in which M. Fremy declared _that minute\r\nquantities do not ferment_, we had the malicious satisfaction of showing\r\na great many very small closed flasks, into each of which we had caused\r\na single drop of the must of crushed grapes to be introduced by suction.\r\nWe broke the thin points of many of them, in the presence of the\r\nAcademy, and every one of them showed by a sharp hissing, which was\r\naudible at a distance, that fermentation was proceeding in the drop of\r\nliquid they contained. M. Fremy was there, but he made no remark.\r\n\r\nWe may cite some very curious facts on the subject of the period at\r\nwhich the germs that develop yeast are in a condition to be able to\r\ncause fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn July 25th, 1875, in the neighbourhood of Arbois (Jura), the grapes\r\nwere still green and of the size of peas. We went to a vine that was far\r\nfrom paths and roads, and there, with a pair of small scissors, cut some\r\ngrapes from off a bunch and let them fall with their short stalks into\r\ntubes half filled with gooseberry must, previously rendered unalterable\r\nby boiling. These tubes we closed again with all possible precautions,\r\nusing corks which had been passed through the flame of a spirit-lamp and\r\ncarried them to our laboratory, where we left them to themselves. Some\r\ndays afterwards we saw diverse fungoid growths appear in most of the\r\ntubes, but not one of them then, or subsequently, presented the least\r\nappearance of fermentation. The germs of yeast at that period of the\r\nyear did not exist either upon the woody part of the bunch, or upon the\r\ngrapes. In Chapter V. we shall return to observations on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n               § IV.—Wort and Must Exposed to Common Air.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the principles which we have laid down possess all the value that we\r\nattribute to them, if the cause of change in natural or artificial\r\norganic liquids does not exist in those liquids themselves, if change\r\nconsidered in itself depends upon the nature and number of the particles\r\nof dust in various places, if it is, besides, radically affected by the\r\ncomposition of the liquids, it must necessarily follow that wort or\r\nmust, whilst, under certain circumstances of exposure to air, it remains\r\nabsolutely free from life and its results, will, under other\r\ncircumstances, give rise to a variety of organisms and their\r\ncorresponding fermentations. This is, in fact, the lesson which direct\r\nproofs will teach us. Before entering upon these new observations in\r\ndetail, we must call the reader’s attention to the difficulty, as\r\nexperience has shown, of interpreting correctly the facts connected with\r\nthe spontaneous impregnations of organic liquids.\r\n\r\nGay-Lussac crushed some grapes under a bell-jar filled with mercury,\r\nafter having washed them in hydrogen, to expel the air adhering to the\r\ngrapes and the sides of the jar. Having waited for several weeks without\r\ndetecting any signs of fermentation, he introduced some bubbles of\r\noxygen, and fermentation showed itself the following day. Gay-Lussac\r\nconcluded that the fermentation of must could not commence without the\r\nhelp of oxygen.[38]\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of his experiment nothing could be truer, and we\r\nmust admire the diffidence with which this great natural philosopher\r\ninterpreted the fact that he had observed. Another French natural\r\nphilosopher, however, M. Cagniard-Latour, observed that the ferment of\r\nalcoholic fermentation was a little cellular plant. What was its origin\r\nin Gay-Lussac’s experiment?\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the doctrine of spontaneous generation were ready with\r\ntheir explanation, and we have seen how MM. Trécul and Fremy, following\r\nmany others, did not hesitate to maintain that the little plant with all\r\nits particles was produced by the action of oxygen on the albuminous\r\nsubstances contained in the juice of the grapes. The experiments, which\r\nwe have given in the preceding paragraph, show us positively that germs\r\nof the ferment of must exist on the surface of the grape, and that,\r\nconsequently, Gay-Lussac’s experiment has a more simple and natural\r\nexplanation. The germs of the ferment existing on the surface of the\r\ngrape become mixed with the juice of the grape when the latter is\r\ncrushed; these germs remain inactive in the presence of hydrogen; they\r\nvegetate as soon as oxygen is introduced to them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the results of our labours in connection with _spontaneous_\r\ngeneration, in 1862, teach us that in Gay-Lussac’s experiment the germ\r\nof the ferment might also have had its origin either in certain\r\nparticles of dust adhering to the sides of the glass bell, or upon the\r\nmercury; and, in a laboratory where alcoholic fermentation is studied,\r\ndust invariably contains dry cells of ferment. The necessity of oxygen\r\nfor the success of the experiment is surprising, when we reflect that\r\nalcoholic fermentation often takes place in liquids that are not exposed\r\nto contact with air; but we shall prove by experiment that,\r\nnotwithstanding what may happen during fermentation, oxygen has the\r\ngreatest influence on the readiness with which ferment develops itself,\r\nand that this gas is indispensable to the revival of withered cells, and\r\nstill more so to the germination of special cells, which we may consider\r\nto be the true germs of the little plant.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the doctrine of _spontaneous_ generation have based\r\nmost of the objections which they vainly urge against their opponents\r\nupon erroneous interpretations of certain facts relating to the\r\nspontaneous impregnation of organic infusions. Taking a very wrong view\r\nof the essential conditions of the phenomena, they require that the\r\nassertors of the diffusion of the germs of microscopic organisms should\r\nbe compelled to place at any one point of space, so to say, all the\r\ngerms of the products of infusions; a demand which really borders on\r\nabsurdity. They believe, or feign to believe, that we are bound to admit\r\nthe existence of germs of must in all places and at all times, on the\r\nbanks of rivers and on the loftiest mountains, and so on.\r\n“Fermentations,” said one of these gentlemen one day, before the\r\nAcademy, “cannot depend upon chance particles of atmospheric dust. How\r\nis it possible that germs of yeast can be present everywhere throughout\r\nthe universe, ever ready to fall upon must?” It is an established fact\r\nthat grapes crushed in any part of the globe whatsoever, even on a\r\nglacier or at the highest elevations, can set up a fermentation. The\r\nexplanation of this pretended impossibility is most simple, for we know,\r\nfrom the facts related in the preceding paragraph, that grapes carry on\r\ntheir skins the germs of their own ferments.\r\n\r\nIn experiments relating to the kind of organisms which we are discussing\r\nwe must never fail to take into account the action of the particles of\r\ndust spread over the articles that are used. Very often an effect that\r\nshould be attributed to germs adhering to the vessels and utensils used\r\nin experiments, the origin of which may be altogether special, is\r\nerroneously imputed to the dust-forming germs—that is to say, to those\r\ngerms which exist in a state of suspension in the air.\r\n\r\nIn our Memoir of 1862, which we have quoted several times, we have\r\nexplained that it is almost impossible to draw any serious conclusions\r\nfrom experiments made in a basin of mercury, because of the organic\r\nparticles of dust which always exist in that metal, and which, without\r\nthe knowledge of the operator, pass into the interior of the vessel,\r\nwhere they produce certain changes which one is tempted to impute to\r\n_heterogenesis_.\r\n\r\nIn all classical works an experiment of Appert’s, reproduced by\r\nGay-Lussac, is given. This, through a faulty interpretation, led to the\r\nhypothesis of the continuity of the causes of fermentation, if we may\r\nuse such a term, in the atmospheric air.[39]\r\n\r\nWhen we decant bottles of must, which has been preserved by Appert’s\r\nmethod, into other bottles, all the latter soon set up a fermentation:\r\nthis constitutes the experiment. If it were proved that the must, whilst\r\nbeing decanted, came in contact with atmospheric air alone, as\r\nGay-Lussac believed, we should be compelled to admit, according to the\r\ntheory of germs, that the must had come in contact with some particles\r\nof ferment in the air during decanting. And again, if it were shown that\r\nthe experiment could succeed in any place whatsoever, we must come to\r\nthe conclusion that germs of ferment exist everywhere in a state of\r\nsuspension in the air.\r\n\r\n“I have taken,” writes Gay-Lussac, “a bottle of must that had been\r\npreserved for a year and was perfectly transparent, and have decanted\r\nthe must into another bottle, which I then carefully corked and exposed\r\nto a temperature of 15° C. to 30° C. (59° F. to 86° F.). Eight days\r\nafterwards the must has lost its transparency; fermentation has taken\r\nplace in it, and soon my must has become transformed into a vinous\r\nliquor, sparkling like the best champagne. A second bottle of must that\r\nhad been preserved for a year, like the preceding one, but which had not\r\nbeen brought into contact with the air, has presented no signs of\r\nfermentation, although placed under conditions most favourable to its\r\ndevelopment.”\r\n\r\nThe result of this experiment, when roughly made, is correctly described\r\nby Gay-Lussac; in other words, it may be proved that if, at the time of\r\nvintage, we prepare some bottles of must, after Appert’s process, and,\r\nin the course of time, open them and decant their contents into other\r\nbottles, we shall soon see the must ferment and deposit yeast. It is,\r\nnevertheless, equally certain that the inferences which have been drawn\r\nfrom this celebrated experiment have been founded on error, and that the\r\ngerms of yeast are very rarely derived from the particles of dust\r\nfloating in the air with which the must comes in contact. The germs in\r\nquestion are, in our opinion, generally derived, not from the air, but\r\nfrom the sides of the bottles, from corks, from the string employed in\r\ncorking, from corkscrews, and from a variety of other things. The reason\r\nfor this is that any room, vault, cellar, or laboratory where the\r\ngrapes, or must, or vintage, are handled—unless special precautions, of\r\nwhich Appert and Gay-Lussac certainly never thought, are taken—all the\r\nutensils, as well as all articles of clothing, and all the sides of the\r\nbottles which the hands have touched, are contaminated by cells of\r\nferment derived from must that has fermented, or by germs from the\r\nsurface of grapes and clusters. Thus, at the moment of decanting the\r\nmust, a thousand accidental circumstances may lead to the introduction\r\nof those germs, the origin of which, as we have seen, may be actually\r\ntraced to the very grapes which served for the manufacture of the must.\r\nIn other words, we believe the inference that the germs of yeast which\r\ncause the experiment to succeed, are derived from particles of dust\r\nfloating in the air of the place where we decant the contents of our\r\nbottles, to be altogether an erroneous one.\r\n\r\nSince the preceding remarks were written, we have endeavoured to repeat\r\nthis experiment of Gay-Lussac’s in such a manner as we believed would\r\nconfirm our views, by varying the conditions in such a way as would\r\ncause it to succeed or fail, according to the circumstances of the\r\nmanipulation employed.\r\n\r\nOn December 7th, 1874, we took two bottles of must which we had\r\npreserved, after Appert’s process, in our laboratory from the beginning\r\nof October, 1873. Both of these were covered with dust—the dust that\r\nfloated about in our laboratory. We decanted them as follows:—One\r\nbottle, which we handled without special precautions, we uncorked by\r\nmeans of an ordinary corkscrew, and decanted into another bottle that\r\nhad been well washed, as bottles are washed when they are to be used\r\nsubsequently. This bottle was taken from a number that had been standing\r\nupside down on a drainer for a fortnight. We took no precaution to\r\nremove the dust which covered the exterior of the bottle of must, or to\r\npurify the washed bottle. The second bottle of must, on the other hand,\r\nwas decanted after we had removed the dust that covered it; its cork was\r\ncut off close to the string, and the flame of a spirit lamp was passed\r\nover the string and the surface of the cork; and, as a final precaution,\r\nthe corkscrew was passed through the flame. As for the bottle into which\r\nwe subsequently decanted the must, we first plunged it in a hot-water\r\nbath kept at 100° C. (212° F.), then took it into a garden to cool\r\nupside down in the open air. After these precautions we removed it, and\r\nimmediately decanted into it the must from the second bottle.\r\n\r\nThe first bottle showed signs of growths, both on the surface and at the\r\nbottom of the must, the day after the operation, and manifested the\r\nfirst symptoms of alcoholic fermentation on December 16th. The contents\r\nof the second bottle remained perfectly unchanged after being exposed to\r\nthe warmth of a stove for several months.\r\n\r\nCan anything be more conclusive than these facts? They are in perfect\r\nkeeping with the views that we have recently expressed, and with the\r\nprinciples that we have maintained for nearly twenty years, on the\r\nsubject of the causes of change in organic liquids.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means our intention to assert that in the atmospheric air\r\nthere exist no germs of ferment in a state of suspension, as fine dust.\r\nBeyond all doubt they do so exist in that state; but, as a rule, in\r\ncomparatively small number, their abundance or scarcity being dependent\r\nupon circumstances which control their multiplication, favouring or\r\nrestricting it, as we are about to prove.\r\n\r\nOn May 2nd, 1873, we uncorked two ordinary bottles filled with wort,\r\nprepared in December, 1872, after Appert’s process. To avoid the causes\r\nof error which we have mentioned, we uncorked the bottles in the\r\nfollowing manner:—The cork was cut off to the level of the neck; the\r\ncork and string were next passed through flame, regardless of burning\r\nand charring them; we then gently extracted the cork by means of a\r\ncorkscrew which also had been passed through the flame.\r\n\r\nThe bottles thus prepared were placed on the table of an underground\r\nroom, in which we were continually making experiments on alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n_1st bottle._—On May 7th we observed little particles of fungoid growth\r\non the surface of the liquid, and at the bottom were large flakes of\r\n_mycelium_.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th a veil of _mycoderma vini_ had formed: there were no signs\r\nof fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn May 13th vigorous fermentation commenced; it lasted until May 23rd.\r\nThe microscope revealed yeast in globules of two sizes, the larger of\r\nwhich were considerably less numerous than the others. There were no\r\nsigns of lactic or butyric ferment.\r\n\r\n_2nd bottle._—May 7th, particles of fungoid growth on the surface of the\r\nliquid, and also a veil of _mycoderma vini_. On May 11th, 13th, and up\r\nto the 23rd, no signs of fermentation were visible. On May 30th\r\nfermentation was active. The microscope showed us yeast mixed with\r\nbutyric _vibrios_.\r\n\r\nIn this case, alcoholic ferments had come into existence, and from the\r\nprecautions taken at the moment when the liquid was brought into contact\r\nwith the external air, it is certain that the advent of the germs of\r\nthose ferments, as also those of the other organisms which made their\r\nappearance—the fungoid growths, _mycoderma vini_ and _vibrios_—could\r\nonly be accounted for by the fall of particles of dust floating about in\r\nthe room. It follows, then, that under certain circumstances germs of\r\nalcoholic ferment may be found floating in the air; but we can readily\r\nshow that the peculiar conditions of the place had a large share in\r\nbringing about the results obtained by the foregoing experiment.\r\n\r\nThe same day, May 2nd, 1873, we uncorked, with the precautions that we\r\nhave already described, four other bottles of the same must. These were\r\nplaced in a room which was used less frequently than the preceding one,\r\nand in which experiments relating to fermentation were seldom conducted.\r\n\r\n_1st bottle._—On May 8th we observed on the surface of the liquid large,\r\nfrothy pieces of mycelium (_mucor mucedo_ or _mucor racemosus_). The\r\nliquid was perfectly bright.[40]\r\n\r\nMay 30th.—No signs of actual fermentation yet visible.\r\n\r\n_2nd bottle._—On May 8th we noticed a thin, greasy-looking scum on our\r\nliquid, which had become turbid and acquired a sour smell. The\r\nmicroscope showed that this scum was formed of _mycoderma aceti_. On May\r\n30th the scum had assumed a whitish appearance, and seemed to be dead;\r\nthere was a green spot of _penicillium glaucum_ upon it. No signs of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n_3rd bottle._—May 8th, patches of fungoid growth on the surface of the\r\nliquid. May 30th, thick and abundant fungoid growth, but no\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n_4th bottle._—May 8th, little patches of fungoid growth, and a scum of\r\n_mycoderma vini_. May 30th, still no fermentation.\r\n\r\nUp to the month of August, 1873, not one of these bottles gave the least\r\nsign of alcoholic or other fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th, 1872, we uncorked four bottles of wort, which also had\r\nbeen preserved by Appert’s process; these we placed on an oven, where\r\nthere were always vessels fermenting, at about 25° C. (77° F.), but\r\nwhere none of the manipulations required for the starting or final study\r\nof fermentations were practised. The next day a fungoid growth, but\r\nunaccompanied by any signs of fermentation, made its appearance, and\r\nthis state of things lasted for five months, after which we ceased to\r\nkeep these bottles under observation.\r\n\r\nOn May 26th, 1873, we uncorked, with all the necessary precautions, ten\r\nbottles of wort, which had been preserved from April 9th, and then left\r\nthem undisturbed in a room where we were constantly engaged in the study\r\nof fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, some patches of fungoid growth appeared on the\r\nsurface of the liquids.\r\n\r\nMay 30th.—Fermentation commenced in one of the bottles.\r\n\r\nMay 31st.—A second bottle likewise began to ferment.\r\n\r\nJune 9th.—Four bottles, including the two preceding ones, were now in a\r\nstate of fermentation. The six bottles that had not fermented were\r\nthereupon covered with caps of paper, taken from the centre of a ream of\r\npaper and passed through a flame. After this, and up to August 1, when\r\nour observations were discontinued, these six bottles underwent no\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples, which are confirmed by many others that we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention in the course of this work, it will be seen\r\nthat the germs of alcoholic ferment are not present in every little\r\npoint of space, constantly ready to fall upon any object, not even in\r\nthose places where one is perpetually dealing with that kind of\r\ngrowth.[41] If we conduct our experiments with exactness, we very soon\r\nlearn that all that has been written on the facility with which\r\nsaccharine musts may be made to ferment, by being rapidly brought into\r\ncontact with the surrounding air, is greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe germs of ferments, especially of alcoholic ferments—the yeast of\r\nbeer and the yeast of wine—are not nearly as abundant in atmospheric\r\nair, or in the particles of dust spread over the surface of things, as\r\nare the spores of fungoid growths. It is easy to understand this, for\r\nspores are generally borne by aerial organs in a state of dryness, so\r\nthat the least breath of wind catches them up and carries them away,\r\nwhilst ferments are composed of moist cellules that do not readily\r\nbecome dry.\r\n\r\nThe vacuous flasks, partly filled with organic liquids, which are opened\r\nand closed again immediately, frequently give us fungoid growths, but\r\nvery rarely alcoholic fermentation, although in the latter respect they\r\nmay not be absolutely sterile. We may cite some proofs of this.\r\n\r\nOn June 19th, 1872, we prepared seven flasks of saccharine liquid,\r\nimpregnated with yeast—our flasks were of 300 c.c. capacity (about 10\r\nfl. oz.)—and contained 100 c.c. of the liquid; we then drew out their\r\nnecks to a small opening, which was sealed during boiling, after the\r\nsteam had expelled all the air.\r\n\r\nOn June 29th we opened them in the principal room of our laboratory.\r\n\r\nOn July 9th, two of the seven flasks gave no sign of organized products;\r\nthe others were swarming with _mycelia_, submerged or fruiting on the\r\nsurface of the liquid, and either with or without _bacteria_ entangled\r\nin their flakes. In two of the flasks there were visible at the bottom\r\nof the liquid some white streaks, which is an indication sometimes of\r\nthe presence of alcoholic ferment, but much more frequently of a little\r\ncellular plant resembling it in appearance, but purely aerial in its\r\ngrowth, that is to say, taking no part in fermentation. Some days\r\nafterward, we saw bubbles of gas rising from the bottom of one of these\r\nflasks, and then fermentation proceeded so rapidly that we were obliged\r\nto open the neck to avoid an explosion. We append a sketch of its\r\nferment (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe other flask with the white streaks showed no signs of any\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of observation we rarely succeed in obtaining active\r\nferments, the reason being that we deal with volumes of air that are too\r\nlimited for the few germs of ferment that exist in a state of suspension\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nWe are more sure of success if we expose a tolerably large surface of\r\nsaccharine liquid to the open air, because, under such circumstances,\r\neven if the exposure is of short duration, a considerable volume of air\r\nwill pass over the surface of the liquid.\r\n\r\nOn May 29th, 1873, at five o’clock in the afternoon, we placed in the\r\nunderground room previously mentioned, at a height of about two feet,\r\nten porcelain dishes having surfaces of from thirty-five to forty square\r\ninches. We had just taken them from boiling water, and after allowing\r\nthem to cool we placed in each quantities of wort to about one-third of\r\nan inch deep, which we poured from bottles uncorked with every\r\nprecaution against the chance of the wort coming into contact with\r\nanything besides the floating particles of dust. On May 30th, at five\r\no’clock, that is after twenty-four hours of exposure to the air of the\r\nroom, we emptied the contents of the basins separately into glass flasks\r\nwith long necks, which had been treated with boiling water and then\r\ncooled, necks downwards. The beak of the basin, by means of which the\r\nliquid was poured, and the funnels—for we used a separate funnel for\r\neach flask—had been passed through the flame. The whole ten flasks were\r\nthen placed in an oven at a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.).[42]\r\n\r\nOn June 1st six of the flasks gave signs of fermentation, and next day\r\nall the flasks were fermenting.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the numerous microscopic observations which we\r\nmade on the liquids and their deposits.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st the liquid in one of the six flasks which had begun to\r\nferment was covered with a continuous scum of _mycoderma vini_, below\r\nwhich appeared a filamentous network belonging to a _mycelium_, or other\r\nfungoid growth. But neither in the liquid itself nor in the deposit\r\ncould we perceive any cells of the ferment of beer; the field, however,\r\nwas swarming with active butyric _vibrios_, rather thick and short,\r\ntheir length being about twice their diameter. This fermentation was\r\nexclusively butyric.\r\n\r\nOn June 2nd another of the flasks showed no _vibrios_, but alcoholic\r\nferment in small quantity, much lactic ferment, consisting of little\r\nparticles contracted at the middle and non-mobile, and, finally, some\r\nslender filaments, resembling those represented in Plate I., Nos. 1 and\r\n2.\r\n\r\nOn June 3rd we examined the liquid in the flask which showed the most\r\nmarked fermentation. In addition to the flakes of fungoid growths,\r\nchecked in their development through want of air, we found at least five\r\ndistinct productions, which are represented in the accompanying sketch\r\n(Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n    _aaa._—Thick cells of alcoholic ferment, the size of which is given\r\n    in our sketch: thus, 13/450 indicates that the corresponding figure\r\n    is 13/450 millimetre in length (rather more than 1/1000 inch).\r\n\r\n    _bbb._—Small alcoholic ferment, such as we generally see in the must\r\n    of acid and sugared fruits—especially in filtered grape must. Its\r\n    dimensions varied from 1 to 1-½, or 2, 450ths of a millimetre.[43]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n    _ccc._—“Low” yeast, of a type resembling that existing in other\r\n    preparations fermenting in the room.\r\n\r\n    _ddd._—Enlarged, distended spores of _mucor racemosus_. These are\r\n    scarce, and have an old appearance. We shall come to them again in a\r\n    subsequent chapter, where we shall explain their real significance.\r\n\r\n    _eee._—Short _vibrios_, occurring either contracted or not near the\r\n    middle. Some were motionless, others vibrating to and fro and\r\n    executing other movements. These forms belong to the butyric and\r\n    lactic ferments shown on Plate I.\r\n\r\nThe preceding series of experiments shows us that, in the case of wort\r\nexposed to the air, germs of divers organisms, amongst which various\r\nferments—butyric, lactic, and alcoholic—are to be found, fall\r\nsimultaneously from the particles of dust floating in the air. We must\r\nobserve, however, that we were dealing with the air of a laboratory in\r\nwhich we were constantly studying analogous fermentations, and that a\r\ndifferent atmosphere would, most likely, give us different results. We\r\nshall see a proof of this in the following paragraph, where we shall\r\nalso find some new facts tending to prove that the germs of alcoholic\r\nferment do not exist amongst the particles of dust floating in the air,\r\nin anything like the quantity usually supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ V.—New Comparative Studies on the Germs held in Suspension by the Air\r\n    of Different Places which are near each other, but Subjected to\r\n   Different Conditions affecting the Production and Diffusion of the\r\n                    Particles of Dust found in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may compare the character and the greater or less abundance of\r\nsimilar germs existing in neighbouring localities, by studying the\r\nchanges which take place in similar liquids exposed simultaneously to\r\nthe action of the air in those localities. To do this, we must prepare a\r\nlarge number of flasks of the same size, free from air, and containing\r\nabout equal quantities of a particular liquid—the same being used for\r\nall. We must open the same number of these flasks in each of the\r\nlocalities we have selected, and permit the air with all its particles\r\nof dust to rush into them; then we must close our flasks again, and\r\nobserve, day by day, the appearances they present. The results obtained\r\nby these means will not furnish us with conclusions applicable to every\r\nkind of germ that the air contains at any given moment, but only with\r\nconclusions which apply to those germs which can develop in the\r\nparticular liquid employed. Thus, for example, we could draw no\r\ninference as to the nature and relative number of _bacteria_ or\r\n_vibrios_, in the case where we employ an acid liquid; for organisms of\r\nthat kind we must have recourse to neutral or slightly alkaline\r\ninfusions. On the other hand, liquids having a feeble acid reaction\r\nwould favour the growth of _mucedines_, _mycoderms_, and certain\r\nferments, as for example, the alcoholic.\r\n\r\nOn November 26th, 1872, we opened and reclosed thirty flasks containing\r\nmust kept from the last vintage.\r\n\r\nTen flasks were opened at the bottom of the garden of the _École\r\nNormale_.\r\n\r\nTen on the landing of the second floor.\r\n\r\nTen in the principal room of our laboratory, which had been swept out\r\nshortly before, by which operation the dust of the floor had been raised\r\nand put in motion.\r\n\r\nDifferent objects made their appearance in a certain number of the\r\nthirty flasks on the following days; but from December 17th, things\r\nremained stationary. The following observations were made at that date:—\r\n\r\nOf the ten flasks from the bottom of the garden, only one had undergone\r\nany change.\r\n\r\nOf the ten flasks from the interior of the building, four had undergone\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nOf the ten flasks from our laboratory, all had undergone change.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the number of germs held in suspension in the three\r\ndifferent places whence we had taken our air was, therefore,\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the nature of the germs was equally marked. Those\r\nflasks of our first two series which had undergone change presented no\r\ntrace of _torulæ_, or anything besides fungoid growths, whilst three of\r\nthe last ten contained _torulæ_ associated with fungoid growths.[44]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 3. Torulæ in Process of Development.]\r\n\r\nOn May 29th, 1873, eighteen flasks, free from air and with necks drawn\r\nout to a fine point, containing must, were taken into one of our rooms\r\nat the _École Normale_. A jet of gas from an ordinary burner was passed\r\nover the surface of the glass down to the surface of the liquid, with\r\nthe object of burning any particles of dust that might have been\r\ndeposited from the atmosphere of the laboratory; the points of the\r\nflasks were then broken with a pair of ordinary scissors that had been\r\npassed through the flame of a spirit lamp; and, lastly, the tops of the\r\nflasks were taken off, just above the surface of the liquid, and the\r\neighteen flasks thus became transformed into eighteen basins, each\r\ncontaining about 100 c.c. (about 3-½ fluid ounces) of grape must. These\r\neighteen basins were placed on a table in the room, and left there for\r\nfive days, precautions being taken to prevent any one from entering the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe basins were examined on June 2nd: they all contained little flakes\r\nof floating _mycelium_, but none of them had any white streaks on their\r\nsides—a proof that they were destitute of _torulæ_—the liquid had\r\nremained very bright. With the contents of nine of the basins we filled\r\ntwo long-necked flasks that we had prepared for our purpose—that is to\r\nsay, had heated to a certain point, just before using them, with the\r\nobject of removing from their sides any foreign germs which they might\r\nhave picked up in the laboratory. Up to July 10th, when we deemed it\r\nuseless to carry our observations further, these flasks presented no\r\nsigns of fermentation whatever. With the contents of the remaining nine\r\nbasins, we filled two other long-necked flasks, but before doing so, we\r\nkept the basins for twenty-four hours (June 2nd to 3rd) in the basement\r\nof our laboratory. These two flasks soon set up an active fermentation,\r\nand deposited an abundance of yeast—an additional proof of the great\r\ndifference in character of the germs floating about the room and those\r\nfloating about the laboratory.\r\n\r\nOn June 3rd we exposed, simultaneously, in the aforementioned room and\r\nalso in our laboratory, seven basins prepared as just described. On June\r\n8th all the basins in the room showed signs of fungoid growths, without\r\nany trace of _mycoderma vini_, or lines indicative of the presence of\r\n_torulæ_, whilst six of the seven in our laboratory had their sides\r\ncovered with a white precipitate, and on the surface of the liquids a\r\nlayer of isolated patches of fungoid growth. The liquid in these latter\r\nbasins was poured into a long-necked flask, which it nearly filled, and\r\nin the course of forty-eight hours it began to show signs of alcoholic\r\nfermentation.[45] This is another striking proof of the difference\r\nbetween the number of germs of ferment and _torulaceæ_ in the air of our\r\nlaboratory and that of an ordinary room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nWe append drawings of the _torulæ_ found in the six laboratory basins\r\n(see Sketches I., II., III., IV., V., VI. of Fig. 12). The abundance of\r\nthe germs of these organisms in our laboratory is very striking, and is\r\ndoubtless due to the nature of the work carried on there, as well as to\r\nthe power of endurance peculiar to the germs, or the minute vegetative\r\ncells of these microscopic plants—a tenacity of life which prevents them\r\nfrom losing their reproductive powers, even after being dried up into\r\ndust. But varied as are the formations represented in Fig. 12—and it\r\nwill be observed that in IV. and VI. we have shown four distinct forms,\r\nmarked _a_, _a_; _b_, _b_; _m_, _m_; _n_, _n_ respectively—it must not\r\nbe supposed that they correspond necessarily to distinct species. From\r\nthe ends of a compound organism like those in No. III, a little\r\nspherical cell may detach itself and then, by a process of budding, give\r\nrise to a series of other minute spherical cells reproducing the form\r\nshown in Nos. I. and II.\r\n\r\nThe forms figured in No. III. represent one of the types of _mycoderma\r\nvini_, which is often found in this branching arborescent state; but it\r\nfrequently also occurs in short forms, and it is in this shape that it\r\nis generally met with on the surface of wines.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the nature of the substratum has a great influence on\r\nthe changes of aspect in the organisms which we are describing, but this\r\nis not the sole cause of their morphological modifications. We are\r\nstrongly inclined to believe that each of the cells, or vegetating forms\r\nso represented, differing so greatly as they do in aspect, and begotten,\r\nall of them, spontaneously in certain appropriate liquids, in a\r\nlaboratory where researches on fermentation are pursued, is capable of\r\nfurnishing a distinct variety. In fact, there is not a single one of the\r\ncells in the six varieties in Fig. 12, which, taken alone, has not its\r\nown peculiar characteristics, which, by hereditary transmission, it can\r\nimpart, in a greater or less degree, to all the individuals of the\r\ngenerations that succeed it.\r\n\r\nWe may remark, on the other hand, that nothing can be more favourable to\r\nthe isolation of different varieties of _torulæ_ or _mycoderma vini_\r\nthan the spontaneous impregnations to which we submit our liquids. For\r\nwhen suitable liquids contained in flasks exhausted of air are\r\nimpregnated with the particles of atmospheric dust, by opening the\r\nflasks for a moment and then immediately re-sealing them, it must\r\ngenerally happen that we admit only one species of reproductive\r\norganism, so that we shall have a vegetation exclusively of one kind, as\r\nbeing derived from the same mother-cell. If we could take from a crowd\r\ncomposed of men and women separate couples, and forthwith transport each\r\ncouple to a separate isolated and unpeopled island, they would, in the\r\ncourse of time, beyond doubt form so many distinct tribes.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that some of the _torulæ_ in Fig. 12 are not\r\nferments; they do not cause sugar to decompose into alcohol and carbonic\r\nacid, any more than the _mycoderma vini_ does; but, nevertheless, there\r\nmay be an absolute similarity in aspect, development, shape, and size\r\nbetween the alcoholic ferment, properly so called, and these\r\n_torulaceæ_.\r\n\r\nWe must here cite a case in proof. On May 28th, 1872, in one of the\r\nrooms of our laboratory, we broke the fine points of a series of flasks,\r\nsimilar to those used in our previous experiments, containing must of\r\ngrapes and deprived of air. We then closed up the ends immediately after\r\nthe sudden entrance of the exterior air. One of these flasks developed\r\nonly one kind of organism, which belonged to the _torulaceæ_. On June\r\n7th this was sufficiently abundant to cover all the sides with a white\r\ndeposit, and the surface of the liquid appeared quite free of any\r\n_mycoderma vini_. To assure ourselves that we were actually dealing with\r\none kind of _torulæ_, unattended by fungoid growths, we waited until\r\nJune 14th, but the aspect of things remained unchanged. On that day we\r\nopened the flask; there was no escape of gas to indicate that the\r\ninterior pressure was greater than the exterior. We then subjected the\r\nplant to microscopic examination. It was quite homogeneous, and formed\r\nof a mass of cells, absolutely identical in aspect and size with old\r\ncells of ordinary yeast (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nWe distilled all the liquid, of which there was about 100 c.c., (3-½ fl.\r\noz.) without obtaining any trace of alcohol in our distillate; we\r\ncollected 33 c.c. (about an ounce) of the distillate, which we distilled\r\nagain, and we submitted the distillate a third time to distillation; but\r\neven then there were no more signs of the presence of alcohol than there\r\nhad been in our first distillate.[46]\r\n\r\nWe may safely conclude that our _torula_, in the course of its\r\ndevelopment in must, with a weight that would have been very\r\nappreciable, did not produce, by its action of multiplication 1/10,000\r\nof 1 c.c. of alcohol.\r\n\r\nUnder the following conditions we obtained a slightly different result,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, confirmed the preceding one.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, 1872, we opened and closed twelve flasks similar to those\r\nwe had used before, the sole difference being that they contained yeast\r\nwater[47] sweetened with ten per cent. of sugar. One of these flasks\r\nfurnished us similarly with one kind of _torula_, which bore the\r\ngreatest resemblance to the ferment of beer. When this _torula_ was\r\nbeginning to spread all over the bottom of our flask, we shook up the\r\nliquid, and turned the flask upside down, with the object of submerging\r\nthe torula and depriving it of air, at least at the bottom of the neck.\r\nFor some days, and even months, there were no signs of the liberation of\r\ngas. On July 22nd, 1873, after the interval of a year, we opened the\r\nflask (which gave no indication of the existence of an interior\r\npressure) and endeavoured to discover the presence of alcohol, by means\r\nof successive distillations, as just described. In the two first\r\ndistillates there seemed to be no alcohol, but in the third we detected\r\nits presence in very small quantity. We shall see, later on, that the\r\nformation of such a small quantity of alcohol may be attributed to the\r\nfact of the plant having been submerged when in full growth, and to its\r\nhaving continued to live for some time after its submersion quite\r\nindependently of the oxygen contained in the air of the flask.\r\n\r\nFrom the previous facts it is obvious that there exist certain\r\nproductions of various aspects, the germs of which are particularly\r\nabundant in the dust of a laboratory where the phenomena of fermentation\r\nare studied, productions essentially aerial, and incapable of giving\r\nrise to fermentation, although it may be impossible for the microscope\r\nto distinguish their forms from those of true alcoholic ferments.\r\n\r\nThe idea of some physiological bond between these plants and the\r\nferments which resemble them in so remarkable a manner, is one that\r\nimpresses itself forcibly and, so to say, instinctively upon the mind.\r\nThis remark holds good also in the case of _mycoderma vini_, properly so\r\ncalled, when compared with alcoholic ferments. There appears to be no\r\nother difference between the _mycoderma vini_ and the _torulæ_ of which\r\nwe are speaking, than that afforded by peculiarities of physical\r\nstructure and a certain greasiness in the cells of the former which\r\npermits it to exist, in the form of a scum, upon the surface of liquids,\r\nthat is to say unsubmerged.[48]\r\n\r\nWe have frequently, but without success, endeavoured to bring about the\r\nconversion of these unsubmerged _torulæ_ and _mycoderma vini_ into\r\nalcoholic ferments; in other words, we have never succeeded in imparting\r\nto these _torulæ_ or to _mycoderma vini_, which bear so striking a\r\nresemblance to alcoholic ferments, the permanent fermentative character\r\npeculiar to the latter. At one period of our researches, in 1862, and\r\nmore recently, in 1872, we thought that we had discovered the conditions\r\nunder which such conversion might be possible, but, as we shall explain\r\nin a subsequent chapter, our experiments were affected by certain errors\r\nthat had escaped our notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § VI.—Yeast may become Dry and be Reduced to Dust without losing its\r\n                        Faculty of Reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paragraphs we have given examples of liquids becoming\r\nimpregnated with self-sown alcoholic ferments. We shall proceed to show\r\nthat this little cellular plant may actually exist in the form of dust,\r\nfloating in the air, after the manner of spores of fungoid growth and\r\nthe encysted forms of certain infusoria, without losing its powers of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th, 1872, we collected and pressed all the yeast resulting\r\nfrom a brewing of about one hectolitre (about 22 gallons). From the\r\ncentre of the cake we took a few grammes (50 or 60 grains) of yeast,\r\nwhich we mixed in a porcelain mortar with five times its weight of\r\nplaster—both mortar and plaster having been heated, just before, in an\r\noil bath, to a temperature of about 200° C. (392° F.), and then cooled\r\nrapidly. The powder thus prepared was immediately done up in a twist of\r\npaper, which had been passed through the flame of a spirit lamp, and the\r\ntwist and its contents were then placed in an oven at a temperature of\r\nfrom 20° C. to 25° C. (about 75° F.). The object of these several\r\nprecautions was to free the powder composed of the yeast and plaster, if\r\nnot from the germs contained in floating particles of dust, at all\r\nevents from those contained in the dust existing on the surface of the\r\narticles we used—the mortar, plaster, and paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nOn December 18th, we took up with a platinum spatula, previously passed\r\nthrough the flame, a pinch of the yeast-and-plaster powder, and sowed it\r\nin a two-necked flask (Fig. 14) containing some pure wort. We then\r\nplaced the flask in an oven, at 20° C.\r\n\r\nOn December 21st, three days after we had sown the powder, fermentation\r\nbegan to manifest itself by the appearance of patches of froth on the\r\nsurface of the wort. On December 19th and 20th the yeast was sensibly\r\ndeveloping, although there was no liberation of gas to denote the\r\npresence of actual fermentation. The yeast, examined under the\r\nmicroscope, appeared very pure.\r\n\r\nOn March 5th, 1873, we took another pinch of the yeast-and-plaster\r\npowder from the twist of paper, and placed it in a flask of pure wort,\r\nas in the foregoing experiment.\r\n\r\nOn March 9th, that is, after having been subjected to a heat of 20° C.\r\n(68° F.) in the oven for four days, fermentation began to manifest\r\nitself by the appearance of patches of froth on the surface of the wort.\r\nFrom this it was evident that the yeast had not been destroyed, but only\r\nretarded in its revival.\r\n\r\nOn July 25th, 1873—that is, after a lapse of seven months and a half—we\r\nresumed our experiments, and sowed some more of the yeast-and-plaster\r\npowder in another flask of wort. On August 2nd, eight days from the time\r\nof our sowing, the little islets of froth appeared on the surface of the\r\nliquid. Observed under the microscope, the yeast still seemed pure, and\r\nresembled the original yeast; we append a sketch, which will give an\r\nidea of its shape (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nOn November 7th, 1873, we once more sowed some of the powder. This time\r\nthe yeast was dead; we observed the flask which contained it, day by\r\nday, until February 1st, 1874, without detecting the slightest sign of\r\nfermentation or development of the yeast that we had sown. On February\r\n1st, we made a microscopical examination of the yeast, and found it\r\nmixed with the plaster and absolutely inert at the bottom of the\r\nsaccharine liquid; its cells were isolated, very old-looking and\r\ngranulated, without any appearance that might denote the possibility of\r\ntheir ever budding again.\r\n\r\nThus we determined that alcoholic ferment may be dried at the ordinary\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere, and preserved, in the form of dust, for a\r\nperiod of seven months or longer, without losing its faculty of\r\nreproduction. This faculty evidently diminishes in the course of time,\r\nfor our dried yeast, after having been kept for seven months and a\r\nhalf—all the other conditions of the two experiments having been\r\nprecisely the same—required about eight days to develop sufficiently to\r\nreveal fermentation, whilst, immediately after the drying, it only\r\nrequired three or four days to accomplish the same thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nSide by side with these experiments on alcoholic ferment, we carried on\r\nexactly similar ones with yeast obtained from “high fermentation”\r\nbreweries. On December 16th, 1872, we prepared a powder of this yeast\r\nand plaster as before. Our last sowing took place on July 25th, 1873, in\r\na flask of pure wort, which showed signs of fermentation on July 27th.\r\nWe append a sketch (Fig. 16) which gives the general aspect of this\r\n“high ferment,” when revived after such a lapse of time; it had\r\npreserved the distinctive features of the cells of “high ferment.”\r\n\r\nThese facts can leave no doubt whatever as to the possibility of cells\r\nof yeast existing, in a state of suspension in the air, in the form of\r\nfine dust, particularly in a laboratory where researches on alcoholic\r\nfermentation are pursued.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  We have heard of liquids even less sensitive than these, which\r\n  required a temperature of 120° C. (248° F.) or more, but we have had\r\n  no opportunity of studying them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  See Pasteur, _Mémoire sur les Générations dites Spontanées_ (_Annales\r\n  de Chimie et de Physique_, t. lxiv. 3^e série, année 1862).\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  See my _Mémoire sur les Générations dites Spontanées_, already cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Jules Duval (of Versailles), _Nouveaux faits concernant la mutabilité\r\n  des germes microscopiques.

We could hardly have recourse to a\r\n  better method of preparing these crystals, at least in the case of\r\n  dog’s blood, which seems to yield them with the greatest facility in\r\n  any quantity we might desire to procure. Under the circumstances just\r\n  recounted, in which dog’s blood exposed to contact with pure air\r\n  underwent no putrefactive change whatever, the crystals of that blood\r\n  formed with a remarkable rapidity. From the first day that it was\r\n  placed in the oven and exposed to an ordinary temperature, the serum\r\n  began gradually to assume a dark brown hue. In proportion as this\r\n  effect was produced, the globules of blood disappeared, and the serum\r\n  and the coagulum became filled with very distinct crystals, of a brown\r\n  or red colour. In the course of a few weeks, not a single globule of\r\n  blood remained, either in the serum or coagulum; every drop of serum\r\n  contained thousands of these crystals, and the smallest particle of\r\n  coagulum, when bruised under a piece of glass, presented to view\r\n  colourless and very elastic fibrine, associated with masses of\r\n  crystals, without the slightest trace of blood-globules. Where our\r\n  observations were protracted, it sometimes happened that all the\r\n  fibrine collected into one hyaline mass, which gradually expelled\r\n  every crystal from its interior.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. lvi. p. 738,\r\n  1863.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  GAYON, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, and _Annales\r\n  Scientifiques de l’École Normale Supérieure_, 1874-75.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Amongst these influences one of the most important, according to M.\r\n  Fremy, is “_organic impulse_,”—another gratuitous assumption.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  FREMY, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. lviii. p. 1167,\r\n  1864.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  FREMY, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. lxxiii. p.\r\n  1425, 1871. M. Trécul shares M. Fremy’s opinions, and extends them to\r\n  the development of different fungoid growths.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  This observation had already been made by Anthon and H. Hoffmann. “If\r\n  we scrape the surface of a gooseberry with a blunt knife,” says H.\r\n  Hoffmann, “and put under the microscope the scrapings, which are of a\r\n  whitish colour, we shall recognize amongst many varieties of shapeless\r\n  dirt, earthy particles and other things, the same fungoid spores that\r\n  we find in the expressed juice, but we shall see them there in\r\n  infinitely larger quantities. Some of them will be of a dusky colour\r\n  (_Stemphylium_, _Cladosporium_), and others will be colourless; the\r\n  shape of these latter will be round or oval, and cylindrical. Most of\r\n  them will bear resemblance to beads of the _chaplets_ of _Oidium_,\r\n  _Monilia_, _Torula_ (that is to say, to spores of certain\r\n  _Hyphomycetes_), which have been detached and carried off by the wind,\r\n  and have attached themselves to the fruit. Some of these spores will\r\n  be already provided with short germinating filaments.” (_Annales des\r\n  Sciences Naturelles, Botanique_, t. xiii. p. 21, 1860).\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  The experiments that we have described give rise to a useful remark.\r\n  All the organic liquids, boiled or not, in the course of time must\r\n  take up oxygen from the air. At the same time, and certainly under\r\n  this influence, they assume an amber or brownish colour, but this\r\n  effect is only produced when the liquids are placed under conditions\r\n  of unalterability. Should fermentation or the development of fungoid\r\n  growths be possible, scarcely any change of colour will take place.\r\n  Doubtless this non-coloration may be attributed to the fact that these\r\n  organisms consume the oxygen necessary for coloration. In these\r\n  experiments on must, all the unchanged flasks assumed a pale yellowish\r\n  brown colour; those which fermented or contained fungoid growths\r\n  remained colourless, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  _Comptes rendus de l’Académie, séance du 28 Octobre, 1872._\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  GAY-LUSSAC, _Annales de Chimie_, t. lxxvi. p. 245; read at the\r\n  Institute, December 3rd, 1810. Long before Gay-Lussac, it had been\r\n  remarked that atmospheric air had a great influence on fermentation.\r\n  See M. Chevreul’s articles on the history of chemistry in the _Journal\r\n  des Savants_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  GAY-LUSSAC, _Annales de Chimie_, t. lxxvi. p. 247, _Mémoire cité_,\r\n  1810.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  It is well to notice that under the influence of fungoid growths,\r\n  properly so called, the wort of beer speedily becomes bright. We may\r\n  say that fungoid growths, by their rapid development, clarify the\r\n  must, which serves to nourish them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  It has already been observed in our Memoir on spontaneous generation,\r\n  that alcoholic fermentation is not always to be obtained by sowing\r\n  wads of cotton or asbestos, charged with the particles of dust which\r\n  float through the air, in saccharine musts that are in contact with\r\n  much air. The air which furnished the particles of dust, in the\r\n  experiments to which we are alluding, was taken outside the\r\n  laboratory, in a neighbouring street.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  The decanting into the flasks is necessary, because of the possibility\r\n  of the fermentation in the basins being masked. See further on the\r\n  note on p. 75.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  This small ferment is very curious, although it scarcely affects\r\n  industrial fermentation. It was first described in 1862. (PASTEUR,\r\n  _Bulletin de la Société chimique_, 1862, page 67, and following:\r\n  _Quelques faits nouveaux au sujet des levûres alcooliques_.) It has\r\n  since been described by Dr. Rees under the name _Saccharomyces\r\n  apiculatus_. (Dr. Rees, Leipzig, 1870: _Sur les champignons de\r\n  fermentation alcooliques_. See also Dr. Engel, _Thèse pour le\r\n  Doctorat_, Paris, 1872.) If we carefully filter some grape must at the\r\n  time of vintage, we may be sure that we shall see it appear in the\r\n  clear liquid at the bottom of our vessel, without intermixture with\r\n  any other ferment.\r\n\r\n  Should we not filter the must this ferment will appear all the same,\r\n  but it will soon become associated with another, thicker in appearance\r\n  and more elongated, which also is one of the ferments peculiar to the\r\n  fermentation of grape must.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  We may remind the reader that in 1862, in our _Mémoire sur les\r\n  Générations dites spontanées_, we applied the expression of _torula_\r\n  to all the little cellular plants of spontaneous growth, excepting\r\n  _mycelium_, propagated by budding, after the manner of the ferment of\r\n  beer. At the same time, stress was laid upon the frequent occurrence\r\n  of their germs, especially in our laboratory, where studies on\r\n  fermentation were, even then, carried on. Plate III. represents two of\r\n  these ferments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  It is to be remarked that in this case, as in the case recorded § IV.\r\n  p. 70, in order to detect with certainty any alcoholic ferment, the\r\n  contents of the basins were transferred to a long-necked flask; since\r\n  where, as in the basins, a liquid has a large surface exposed to\r\n  spontaneous impregnation, the strictly alcoholic fermentation may\r\n  escape observation. The reason of this is that, when a liquid of large\r\n  surface but small depth is exposed to the air it affords a suitable\r\n  medium for the active development of moulds, which, by absorbing the\r\n  oxygen which would dissolve in the liquid, checks the growth of the\r\n  ferment, or even prevents its germination altogether. As a matter of\r\n  fact we shall see that for their growth and multiplication ferment\r\n  _cells_, and still more ferment _germs_ (the difference between the\r\n  two will appear in Chap. V.), require a larger supply of oxygen just\r\n  in proportion to their age, state of desiccation, and distance from\r\n  the budding condition. Now, if the spores of moulds be present and\r\n  effect a settlement in the liquid, the increase of the ferment, or\r\n  even its actual germination, is prevented. But by collecting the\r\n  liquid in a deep and narrow vessel, such as a long-necked flask, after\r\n  it has been exposed to spontaneous impregnation, we deprive the moulds\r\n  almost completely of oxygen, and so allow the ferment to exert its\r\n  peculiar energies. The mere act of transferring enables the liquid to\r\n  take up a sufficiency of oxygen, and a liberation of gas very speedily\r\n  shows that fermentative action is going on. We must add further that\r\n  sometimes in a liquid of large surface and shallow depth, in which but\r\n  little ferment is formed, the evolution of carbonic acid gas may fail\r\n  to be detected, by reason of its diffusing itself into the air slowly\r\n  as it is formed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Here we had to seek for a most minute quantity of alcohol, that no\r\n  alcoholometer could have indicated. A certain sign of the presence of\r\n  alcohol is contained in the first few drops distilled; these always\r\n  assume the form of little drops or _striæ_ or, better still, oily\r\n  tears, when alcohol is present in the distillate. The distillation\r\n  should be effected with a small long-necked retort and a Liebig’s\r\n  condenser. We must carefully watch the neck of the retort at the\r\n  moment of boiling; should the liquid contain 1/1000 part of its volume\r\n  of alcohol, we shall observe the indications given above for a short,\r\n  but appreciable time. 1/10,000 of alcohol is difficult to judge, but\r\n  with care and practice we may do it without failing. Collecting a\r\n  third of each distillate, and supposing the limit of appreciation to\r\n  stop at thousandths, in three distillations we may easily detect the\r\n  presence of 1/10,000 of 1 c.c. of alcohol in a total volume of 100\r\n  c.c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Yeast when macerated in water imparts to it certain soluble\r\n  nitrogenous materials. The solution so obtained, filtered from yeast\r\n  globules, is known as _yeast water_.—D. C. R.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  It is possible that this greasiness in the cells of the common\r\n  _mycoderma vini_ arises simply from the composition of the liquid in\r\n  which it vegetates. It is in saccharine liquids that the submerged\r\n  _torulæ_ are found; fermented liquids more readily give birth to the\r\n  forms of _torulæ_ and _mycoderma vini_ which exist as a scum. In all\r\n  probability, however, there is no radical difference between these two\r\n  kinds of little cellular plants of aerial growth, the floating\r\n  _torulæ_ and _mycoderma vini_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n     The Growth of Different Organisms in a State of Purity: Their\r\n                            _Autonomy_.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur observations in the preceding chapter will have shown that organic\r\nliquids, natural or artificial—the wort of beer amongst others—if\r\nexposed to contact with the air, rapidly develop various forms of life.\r\nThis is a natural consequence of the mode of impregnation. The fertility\r\nof the liquid depends on the various microscopic germs which are\r\ndeposited in it by the common air, and these, again, as regards their\r\nnature and number, are dependent upon the situation of the vessel\r\ncontaining them, its height above the ground, the time of year, the\r\ndisturbance of the atmosphere, and other causes.\r\n\r\nThe fortuitous association of other forms, in growths which we believe\r\nto be uniform and independent, constitutes one of the principal\r\ndifficulties that occur in the study of the lower organisms,\r\nparticularly that of fungoid growths. The fact that the germs of many of\r\nthese little beings exist in the atmosphere in the form of dust,\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, or, as such, spread over the surface of the\r\ndifferent materials and objects used in experiments, exposes the student\r\nto constant risk of wrongly interpreting the results which come under\r\nhis notice. He has sown a plant, and is observing the course of its\r\ndevelopment. Without his knowledge, spores of another plant have got\r\nmixed with his growth, and germinated. In his ignorance, he will\r\nattribute all that he sees, all the changes which he describes and which\r\nhe sketches, and all the conclusions which he draws, to the one plant\r\nwhich engages his attention. If he is dealing with _bacteria_,\r\n_vibrios_, and, generally speaking, the infinite variety of mobile\r\nmicroscopic organisms, his embarrassment will be greater still. Again,\r\ninasmuch as the medium which serves as substratum for growths has a\r\nconsiderable influence on the fertility of the germs in contact with it,\r\nas well as on their ulterior development, it often happens that germs\r\ndeposited fortuitously by the particles of dust which fall from the\r\natmosphere or collect on objects are fertile and multiply with rapidity,\r\nwhilst those which have been directly sown, no matter in what number,\r\nremain sterile, or multiply very slowly. If we place in a young wine\r\nsome _mycoderma aceti_, we shall obtain _mycoderma vini_; by placing\r\nsome _mycoderma vini_ in an old wine, especially if it is a little acid,\r\nwe shall obtain _mycoderma aceti_.[50] It is from facts of this kind,\r\nwrongly interpreted, that many errors have crept into our knowledge of\r\nthe lower organisms, and that we are constantly seeing old discussions\r\ncrop up, both on the subject of so-called _spontaneous_ generation and\r\non that of the theory of fermentation. At every step in the course of\r\nthis work we shall see the trace of these complications, as well as the\r\ninfluence they have had on the progress of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to these results, we will study the case of wort sown\r\ndirectly with germs distinctly of one kind, unmixed with any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I.—Growth of Penicillium Glaucum and Aspergillus Glaucus in a State of\r\nPurity—Proofs that these Fungoid Growths do not become Transformed into\r\n  the Alcoholic Ferments of Beer or Wine.—Preliminary Enquiry into the\r\n                         Cause of Fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us again take one of the flasks furnished with two necks such as we\r\nhave already described, and let it be supposed that this flask contains\r\na quantity of saccharine wort, brewed some considerable time ago, which\r\nhas undergone no change whatever, except in colour, the slow process of\r\noxidation having gradually darkened the original colour of the liquid.\r\nWhat we have to do is to drop into this unchanged and fertile liquid\r\nsome grains or spores of _penicillium_ which are free from the slightest\r\ntrace of the spores or germs of other microscopic organisms.\r\n\r\nOne means of effecting this consists in taking up with a pair of\r\nmetallic forceps, previously heated, a piece of platinum wire, one or\r\ntwo centimetres (about 3/4 in.) in length, which we also pass through\r\nthe flame of a spirit lamp, and with which, as soon as it is cold, we\r\ntouch a mass of sporanges of a growth of _penicillium_. No matter how\r\nfew spores may be taken up on the end of the platinum wire, we shall\r\nhave far more than we require for the impregnation of the liquid. At the\r\nmoment of charging the point of the wire we withdraw the glass stopper\r\nwhich closes the india-rubber tube on the right-hand neck of the flask\r\n(Fig. 14) and drop the wire through that tube; we then replace the glass\r\nstopper, after having, by way of additional precaution, passed it\r\nrapidly through the flame of the lamp. There is no doubt that we expose\r\nourselves to error in consequence of having to convey the wire through\r\nthe surrounding air, and also, in consequence of having previously to\r\nopen the flask; but, as we have already remarked, this double cause of\r\nerror has never, we may say, interfered with the exactness of our\r\nexperiments, the volume of air with which we are concerned being\r\nexceedingly limited. Moreover, our flask being in free communication\r\nwith the exterior air, by means of the opening in the curved, slender\r\ntube, there is no inrush of air when we withdraw the stopper. The chance\r\nof encountering a spore or fecund germ and introducing it into the flask\r\non the wire that is charged with the others, is so remote that we have\r\nconsidered it unnecessary to adopt a more perfect apparatus, which might\r\neasily have been devised had we felt that it was necessary.\r\n\r\nA more serious cause of error may occur in the preceding method;\r\nresulting from the possible impurity of the spores taken from a field of\r\n_penicillium_ which has developed in contact with common air. This field\r\nreceives, every instant, and has received throughout its growth,\r\nparticles of dust which have fallen from the atmosphere; thus, it may\r\nnot be, and, as a matter of fact, is not, free from the germs of other\r\nfungoid growths.[51]\r\n\r\nThe operator, without knowing it, may frequently sow, besides the\r\n_penicillium_, which is all he can see, spores of _mucor mucedo_ and\r\n_mycoderma vini_, in short, of all the most common fungoid growths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nThis process of impregnation, therefore, does not afford us sufficient\r\nsafeguards, but by means of the following device we shall render it more\r\nsatisfactory. Let us take a series of flasks shaped as in Fig. 17,\r\ncontaining an organic liquid suitable to the development of fungoid\r\ngrowths, that is to say, slightly acid—yeast-water, plain or sugared,\r\nthe wort of beer, or Raulin’s fluid[52] will answer our purpose; let us\r\nboil the liquid, and having previously drawn out the necks, let us close\r\nthe ends in the flame of a lamp whilst the steam is escaping, as soon as\r\nwe judge that the air has been nearly all expelled. Having prepared ten\r\nor twenty of these flasks in this manner, when they are cold we may\r\nbreak their points in any place we may be in. The air will rush into the\r\nflasks, and we must then seal them up again in the flame of the lamp,\r\nand put them aside for future observations. In a certain number of these\r\nflasks, as we have already explained in our experiments carried on after\r\nthis fashion, we shall see some fungoid growths appear, first in the\r\nshape of flakes of _mycelium_ floating in the liquid, and afterwards\r\ncoming to the surface to fructify. Now, it often happens that\r\n_penicillium glaucum_ appears alone, so numerous are the spores of this\r\nfungus floating in the air. Under such conditions, we shall evidently\r\nobtain a field of sporanges quite free from the presence of other\r\norganisms. If we now take off the neck of one of the flasks containing\r\nthe pure _penicillium_, and take out some of the germs with our platinum\r\nwire,[53] we shall thus obtain with most certainty spores of\r\n_penicillium_ free from impurities.\r\n\r\nOur readers will excuse the length of these details and the minutiæ of\r\nour precautions, but we shall again and again see that to neglect them,\r\nor any part of them, is to expose ourselves to hazard in drawing sure\r\nconclusions from facts which come under our observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nOn June 17th, 1872, we placed some pure spores of _penicillium_ in a\r\nseries of three flasks containing wort (Fig. 18), observing all the\r\nprecautions that we have indicated. We shall designate these flasks by\r\nthe letters A, B, C. On the following day the spores germinated, and the\r\nliquid became full of flakes of mycelium, some of which came to the\r\nsurface to fructify. The temperature varied between 25° C. and 30° C.\r\n(77° to 86° F.).\r\n\r\nOn June 22nd, small patches, with whitish borders and green centres,\r\ndeveloped on the liquids. We then shook up the flask A, in order to\r\nsubmerge the plant and the spores.[54] We also shook the flask B, after\r\nobserving the precaution of sealing up the slender bent tube.[55] The\r\nflask C was attached on one side to an aspirator, on the other to a tube\r\nfilled with cotton, and every day we renewed the air in it.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks and months over which our observations extended, there\r\nwas not the least formation of yeast in these flasks; moreover, we have\r\nfrequently repeated this and other experiments of a similar kind,\r\nwithout ever detecting the appearance of either ordinary yeast or any\r\nother true alcoholic ferment. The experiments may be made with\r\nsaccharine juices that are highly favourable to the development of\r\n_bacteria_ and lactic ferment. These latter appear equally incapable of\r\ntransformation into yeast, which has never been seen to develop in\r\nexperiments where they were used, if proper precautions have been taken\r\nto secure a pure growth. Should we neglect any of the precautions that\r\nare necessary to secure the purity of our spores, we may of course\r\nobtain different results. If, for instance, we sow spores of\r\n_penicillium_ grown in free contact with the atmosphere, and\r\nconsequently exposed to the particles of dust floating therein, we shall\r\nfrequently observe, mixed with the fruiting hyphæ of the fungoid growth,\r\nyeast and _mycoderma vini_ and _torulæ_, or even _bacteria_ and lactic\r\nferment. Thus we shall be led to believe, in all good faith, that we\r\nhave under our eyes examples of the changes of spores of fungoid growth\r\ninto cells of ferment, or proofs of the conversion of _bacteria_ or\r\nlactic ferment into the same cells.\r\n\r\nCauses of error of this nature have induced some German naturalists to\r\nbelieve that they have succeeded in proving, beyond the possibility of\r\ndoubt, that a number of fungoid growths may produce alcoholic ferment,\r\nand that they have clearly demonstrated that spores of these fungi may\r\nbecome transformed into yeast. In 1856 M. Bail, and, about the same\r\ntime, Berkeley, and, later on, H. Hoffmann and Hallier, have\r\nsuccessively entertained these views, which were introduced into science\r\nby M. Turpin. We have combated them since the year 1861.[56] Since that\r\nperiod they have lost rather than gained ground abroad, in spite of the\r\ngrowing favour bestowed on the Darwinian system. One of the mycologists\r\nwho enjoy the most legitimate authority beyond the Rhine, M. de Bary,\r\nhas arrived, as we have, at absolutely negative results.\r\n\r\nA simple perusal of what has been written in favour of the\r\ntransformations which we are discussing causes us to entertain the\r\ngravest doubts as to the correctness of results which are quoted as\r\ndecisive. We need only give one example, which we extract from a paper\r\nby M. H. Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n“In some cases,” this author writes, “and under favourable\r\ncircumstances, I have been able to see the ferment produce filaments,\r\nboth small specimens that could be examined immediately under the\r\nmicroscope, and also large specimens, and I have recognized, amongst\r\nother varieties, _penicillium glaucum_, _ascophora mucedo_, _ascophora\r\nelegans_, and _periconia hyalina_, sometimes isolated, sometimes\r\nintermixed. This result is most easily to be obtained by the following\r\nmethod:—Pour a small quantity of water into a test-tube, which should\r\nthen be placed slantingly: introduce some fresh yeast into the middle\r\npart of the tube, and close the tube with a wad of cotton, to prevent\r\nthe entrance of exterior particles of dust. In this vapour-filled\r\nreceptacle we shall sometimes see flakes develop. It seems that Messrs.\r\nBerkeley and G. H. Hoffmann have also obtained _penicillium_ from\r\nferment, by a similar process.”[57]\r\n\r\nWhy, however, should it not be admitted that _penicillium_ found under\r\nsuch conditions may be derived from spores of that growth, adhering to\r\nthe sides of the tube before it is closed with the wad, or mixed with\r\nthe yeast that is put into the tube?\r\n\r\nThe facts alleged during the last few years by M. Bail, who persists in\r\nhis views, in spite of their apparently greater exactness, are also far\r\nfrom being satisfactory.[58]\r\n\r\nM. Trécul, who is almost the only one in France, besides Messrs. Ch.\r\nRobin and Fremy, to participate in these errors, does not confine\r\nhimself to affirming the change of the spores of _penicillium_ into\r\nyeast, and _vice versâ_; his system is a far more extensive one.\r\n“According to my observations,” he says, “there would be the following\r\nseries of changes; albuminous matter changed into _bacteria_, or\r\ndirectly into alcoholic ferment, or into _mycoderma_; _bacteria_ into\r\nlactic ferment, there becoming immoveable; lactic ferment into alcoholic\r\nferment; alcoholic ferment into _mycoderma cerevisiæ_; finally,\r\n_mycoderma cerevisiæ_ into _penicillium_.[59]”\r\n\r\nM. Trécul does not stop here. He goes on to explain the principal of\r\nthese changes, as though his testimony were quite beyond refutation:\r\n\r\n“If we use a perfectly filtered wort, containing no granulations, and\r\nprepared at a temperature between 60° C. and 70° C. (140° F. and 160°\r\nF.), there will first of all appear a multitude of fine granules that\r\nwill develop into active bacteria, which, losing the faculty of motion,\r\nwill constitute lactic ferment, as I have repeatedly pointed out. A few\r\ndays after the appearance of the first granules, we shall perceive\r\nothers rather larger in size and isolated. These will increase in size,\r\nand, in the course of time, assume the form of little globuloid, or\r\nelliptic cells; they will not commence to bud before they have attained\r\na comparatively large size, approaching that of ordinary yeast,\r\nconsequently, there will be a considerable interval of time, during\r\nwhich the young cells will present no buds, especially if we work at a\r\nlow temperature, as from 20° C. to 35° C. (68° F. to 95° F.)\r\n\r\n“As for the transformation of the spores of _penicillium_ into alcoholic\r\nferment, the possibility of which M. Pasteur also denies, I have very\r\noften obtained it by using liquids, such as boiled wort and sugared\r\nbarley water, which had stood for a month or six weeks without setting\r\nup an alcoholic fermentation. These liquids, sown with spores of\r\ndifferent forms of _penicillium_, chosen when young and in full growth,\r\nfermented after a varying number of days, even at a temperature of 12°\r\nC. (54° F.), the condition of fermentation being that the flasks were\r\nclosed with very elastic corks, which had been boiled for a quarter or\r\nhalf an hour; these corks, as I have already pointed out, it is best to\r\nkeep for a month after the boiling, to make sure, by drying them\r\nthoroughly again, of destroying any _mycelia_ adhering to them. It is\r\nnecessary to keep the flasks stoppered that the corks may be always\r\nmoist, and it is also advisable to shake the flasks once or twice a day,\r\nto secure the submersion of the spores. If these conditions are carried\r\nout, we shall soon see the spores increase in size, gradually lose their\r\ngreen colour and then bud, and often a very active fermentation will\r\nmanifest itself. All the spores will be transformed, if the flasks are\r\nperfectly air-tight.”[60]\r\n\r\nSuch is the manner in which M. Trécul regards these changes. His is\r\nentirely a system of spontaneous generation, worked out into minutest\r\ndetail, from the transformation of the albuminous substances to the\r\nformation of cells of the higher organisms, passing from the\r\ndisintegration of the original substances to the formation of very fine\r\ngranules, from these to the creation of active _bacteria_, which last,\r\nin their turn, become lactic ferment through the simple cessation of\r\ntheir faculty of moving and so on. We regard all this as purely\r\nimaginary. As a matter of fact, M. Trécul’s argument is based on the\r\nsuccessive phenomena which manifest themselves in filtered wort\r\n“containing no granulations.” As M. Trécul reasons, this condition is a\r\nnecessity, for he starts with the assertion that the albuminous\r\nsubstances in the wort become changed into granulations “that will\r\ndevelop into active bacteria.” This is another of M. Trécul’s illusions.\r\nNo doubt we may filter hopped wort to almost perfect clearness, but we\r\ncan only do this when it is cold. If we filter it warm, it will be\r\nbright as long as it remains warm, but as soon as cold it will appear\r\nturbid, in consequence of the great number of minute granules floating\r\nin it. Again, cold wort, however little it may be or has been in contact\r\nwith air, undergoes a process of oxidation, and this oxidation, which\r\nacts principally on the colouring or resinous matter, causes a deposit\r\nof fine granules, the number of which is constantly increasing as\r\noxidation goes on. These granules form an absolutely inert precipitate\r\nwhich, under no possible circumstances, can become transformed into\r\nactive bacteria. Nothing can be easier than to prove this fact, by\r\ntaking some of our two-necked flasks (Fig. 4) and preparing pure wort in\r\nthem, by boiling, and then leaving it to cool and undergo the process of\r\noxidation. In wort thus exposed to the air—the air being pure and free\r\nfrom germs—there will be formed a granular deposit, which will never\r\nbecome active or transform itself into any kind of organism whatever.\r\n\r\nWe may also remark that whilst M. Trécul used wort in his experiments,\r\nhe does not tell us if it was hopped or not. Had M. Trécul informed us\r\nthat the facts which he described applied to unhopped wort, we should\r\nreply that a temperature of 60° C. or 70° C. (140° F. or 160° F.) is\r\nquite insufficient to kill the germs of bacteria existing in such a\r\nwort. Hopped wort should be heated to 70° C. or 75° C. (160° F. to 170°\r\nF.), that it may remain inert after having cooled down in contact with\r\npure air; unhopped wort must be heated to about 90° C. (194° F.).\r\n\r\nIn short, whatever may be the case, it must be evident to our readers\r\nthat the active bacteria observed by M. Trécul existed in the form of\r\ngerms in the wort that he used, and that what he observed was nothing\r\nmore than the development of these germs when brought into contact with\r\nthe air held in solution in the liquid.\r\n\r\nAs for the success of M. Trécul’s experiments on the _penicillium_, we\r\nhave no doubt that that gentleman has sown germs of yeast or _torulæ_,\r\nwhich bear so striking a resemblance to yeast, at the same time that he\r\nsowed spores, since he took his spores from sporangia of _penicillium_\r\nthat had been exposed to contact with ordinary air. The conditions under\r\nwhich M. Trécul conducted his experiment rendered it difficult for the\r\nspores—although, relatively, much more numerous than the contaminating\r\ngerms of ferment with which they happened to be associated—to make way\r\nagainst these latter, since the spores were unable to continue their\r\ndevelopment in a medium that was deprived of oxygen. On the other hand,\r\nthe cells of ferment might easily have multiplied to such an extent as\r\nto make the discovery of the spores that had been sown a matter of some\r\ndifficulty, since those spores would have been lost amongst the great\r\nnumber of cells of ferment. This was, probably, one of the causes which\r\nled to the mistaken notion that such spores underwent conversion into\r\ncells of ferment. Now although botanists describe several varieties of\r\n_penicillium glaucum_, we do not suppose that the cause of the\r\ndifference between our results and those obtained by M. Trécul can be\r\nattributed to our having operated upon a different variety of\r\n_penicillium_ from that which he used. Supposing that there had been a\r\ngreat difference between our two varieties, still M. Trécul declares\r\nthat he has realized the phenomenon with numerous varieties of this\r\nfungus.\r\n\r\nM. Trécul expresses himself as follows: “I have used spores of\r\n_penicillium_ of several varieties in these experiments: Firstly, thick,\r\ngreen, elliptic spores of a variety of _penicillium_ that grows on\r\nlemons; secondly, elliptic spores of a bluish colour and smaller than\r\nthe preceding, of another variety of _penicillium_ found on lemons;\r\nthirdly, spherical spores of the variety termed _penicillium\r\ncrustaceum_; fourthly, spores of the _penicillium_ that develops on the\r\nyeast of beer.[61]”\r\n\r\nThis criticism of M. Trécul’s opinions was written on the occasion of a\r\ndiscussion at the Academy, after we had been induced to read over again\r\nthe remarks which he had published on the subject. We were so impressed\r\nby the positive manner in which his conclusions were stated, that we\r\nasked ourselves, once more, which of us could be mistaken, and once\r\nmore, also, we applied ourselves to fresh experiments, which we\r\nconducted with every possible precaution, following, as far as we could\r\nwithout falling into the errors of which we accuse the learned botanist,\r\nthe mode of procedure that he adopted. As his descriptions struck us as\r\nbeing at times insufficient, we resolved to ask him for certain\r\nexplanations _vivâ voce_ (November 3rd, 1873), which he gave us with the\r\ngreatest willingness.\r\n\r\n“Every variety of _penicillium_,” said M. Trécul, “especially when young\r\nand vigorous, is amenable to transformation into ferment. This is the\r\nway in which I operated; I had some little flasks of 30 c.c. to 40 c.c.\r\n(about 1-½ fluid ounces) in capacity, filled quite full with wort, or,\r\nat least, containing very little air, closed perfectly air-tight with\r\ncorks which I had kept for a quarter of an hour in boiling water. These\r\nflasks when corked were heated to 60° C. or 70° C. (140° to 158° F.).\r\nAfter they had cooled I uncorked them, and introduced into them the\r\nspores which had been prepared as follows: I placed on a piece of glass\r\nsome spores of the variety of _penicillium_ that I wished to study,\r\ntaken with a pair of forceps from a mouldy lemon, and I mixed these\r\nspores with a drop of wort and observed them under the microscope to\r\nassure myself that they contained nothing of a foreign nature; then I\r\npoured my drop of wort from the piece of glass into one of the flasks,\r\nwhich I recorked and laid down. The transformation into ferment took\r\nplace next day.”\r\n\r\nProvided with these new data we set to work again and prepared a series\r\nof little flasks which were filled quite full with hopped wort, or\r\ncontained but very little air, as M. Trécul had recommended. These we\r\nheated in a hot water bath to 70° C. (158° F.) at least; we then\r\nimpregnated them, observing the necessary precautions, which we\r\ndescribed at the commencement of this paragraph—not working in the\r\nevidently defective manner in which M. Trécul had done. Taking his\r\nspore-seeds from a field of sporanges exposed to the air, and afterwards\r\nmanipulating them, in contact with the air, in water on a piece of\r\nglass, before he made his microscopical examination, his experiments\r\nwere conducted under circumstances in every way conducive to the\r\nintroduction of causes of error. One of the most serious of those causes\r\nis that which results from the substratum of the spores as taken from a\r\nmouldy lemon. If M. Trécul will examine under the microscope the water\r\nin which any lemon has been washed—even a sound lemon, unattacked by any\r\nfungoid growth—he will immediately see the cause of error to which his\r\nmethod of working exposes him. Germs of microscopic organisms exist\r\nabundantly on the surface of all fruits.\r\n\r\nHaving impregnated the liquids in our flasks with spores from a quantity\r\nof pure sporangia grown in a closed vessel, gathered on the point of a\r\nplatinum wire, which had first been heated and then allowed to cool, we\r\nfound that in each case, without exception, germination took place, then\r\na _mycelium_ was developed, which soon, however, ceased to grow from\r\nwant of a proper supply of air; but not in any single case was there the\r\nfaintest trace of fermentation, formation of yeast, or appearance of\r\n_bacteria_ or lactic ferment.\r\n\r\nWe repeated these experiments, using unhopped wort instead and obtained\r\nsimilar negative results. We had previously determined that it was\r\nnecessary to heat flasks of hopped wort to 70° C. (158° F.), at least,\r\nand those of unhopped wort to 90° C. (194° F.) to secure them from\r\nfurther change.\r\n\r\nIn short, contrary to the assertions of M. Trécul, M. H. Hoffmann, and\r\nother naturalists, it is not true that the spores of _penicillium_ can\r\nchange into alcoholic ferment.\r\n\r\nRegarded from another point of view, growths of pure _penicillium_ will\r\ngive us some remarkable results, the interpretation of which seems to us\r\nto be intimately connected with the physiological theory of fermentation\r\nthat we shall discuss in a subsequent chapter. It is a question as to\r\nthe production of alcohol whilst the life of the plant is carried on\r\nunder certain conditions of growth.\r\n\r\nIf we distil saccharine liquids on the surface or in the body of which\r\nwe have grown _penicillium_, and repeat the distillation in the manner\r\nthat we have already described for the detection of the minutest\r\nquantities of alcohol, we shall readily find that those liquids\r\nfrequently do contain a little ordinary alcohol. Moreover, if we regard\r\nthe quantities of alcohol produced, which are always very minute, seldom\r\nexceeding 1 or 1·5 thousandth of the total volume of the liquids, we\r\nshall find that there is no fixed proportion between this alcohol and\r\nthe weights of the plants formed. It is possible, for instance, that we\r\nmay obtain more alcohol from one plant than from another weighing a\r\nhundred times as much. Often, however, when the vegetation is abundant\r\nwe cannot make out the occurrence of alcohol in spite of the\r\nsensitiveness of the process described (p. 78).\r\n\r\nWhat can be the cause of these varying results relating to the\r\nproduction or non-production of alcohol in the vegetation of the little\r\nplant? The numerous experiments that we have made seem to demonstrate\r\npositively that they are dependent upon variations in the amount of air\r\nor oxygen that is supplied to the fungoid growths, whether, that is, the\r\nvegetating mycelium alone be submerged, or the whole plant with its\r\norgans of fructification. When the plant has at its disposal an excess\r\nof oxygen, as much as its vitality can dispose of, there is no alcohol,\r\nor very little, formed. If, on the other hand, the plant vegetates with\r\ndifficulty, in presence of an insufficiency of oxygen, the proportion of\r\nalcohol increases; in other words, the plant shows a certain tendency to\r\nbehave after the manner of ferments.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, wishing to assure ourselves that the spores of\r\n_penicillium_ could not become transformed into ferment, we sowed some\r\npure spores in small flasks, holding from 50 c.c. to 100 c.c. (from 2 to\r\n4 fl. oz.), which contained very little air, and which were sealed\r\nhermetically after the sowing. Under these conditions, the germination\r\nand growth of the spores proceeded with great difficulty, and soon\r\nceased through want of air. The total weight of the little plant was too\r\nsmall to be determined. In cases of this kind, if we distil the whole of\r\nthe liquid we shall often see the alcohol appear in the second\r\ndistillation, even though the weight of the plant may have been scarcely\r\nappreciable. If, on the other hand, side by side with experiments of\r\nthis kind, we grow pure _penicillium_ in flasks containing air and\r\nhaving quantities of saccharine liquids equal to the quantities in the\r\nsmall flasks of which we have been speaking, the plant, in consequence\r\nof the large volume of air at its disposal, will develop vigorously, and\r\nin the course of even a few days will have become perceptibly heavier.\r\nIn distilling the subjacent liquid, however, we shall generally find\r\nthat it contains no alcohol at all, even though the weight of the plant\r\nbe half a gramme, or more (6 or 7 grains).\r\n\r\nThese results apply to all the fungoid growths that we have studied, but\r\nthey vary considerably with the nature of the organisms. _Aspergillus\r\nglaucus_ is, in this respect, one of the most curious.\r\n\r\nOn June 15th, 1873, we impregnated three flasks of wort, A, B, C, with\r\npure spores of _aspergillus glaucus_. The development was rapid and the\r\nfructification abundant. On June 20th, we shook up the liquid and the\r\nsupernatant fungoid growths in the three flasks; the flasks A and B were\r\nthen treated as follows:—\r\n\r\nWe distilled the Liquid in A to discover the presence of alcohol; but\r\ncould find none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe flask B was connected with a test flask (Fig. 19), into which the\r\nliquid, together with its fungoid growth, was transferred from B. The\r\nnext day, June 21st, the mycelium which was on the surface of the\r\nliquid, in the neck of the flask, was studded with bubbles of gas; these\r\nwe dispersed by shaking. On June 22nd, many others had formed again, and\r\na large flake of mycelium that had risen from the bottom of the test\r\nflask had been stopped at the bottom of the neck, quite distended by gas\r\nbubbles. We liberated the gas by shaking, but the bubbles formed again\r\nby the next day, and this effect continued for several days;\r\nnevertheless the liberation of gas was not continuous, as is the case in\r\nan ordinary fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn July 20th we drew off the liquid and distilled it; it was still very\r\nsweet, but though it contained a sensible quantity of alcohol, the\r\nmicroscope failed to detect a single cell of ordinary alcoholic ferment.\r\n\r\nThese results show that the _aspergillus_ when in full growth, with\r\nplenty of air at its disposal, does not yield alcohol, and that if we\r\nsubmerge it, so as to prevent the oxygen of the air from readily coming\r\ninto contact with its various parts, it decomposes sugar, after the\r\nmanner of yeast, forming carbonic acid gas and alcohol.\r\n\r\nThese effects were still more marked in the case of the flask C, the\r\nliquid in which, after having been shaken up, was not decanted to any\r\ngreat depth in our test flask, as had been the case with B. From June\r\n21st, there was _mycelium_ on the surface of the liquid, studded with\r\nlarge bubbles of gas, which formed again after having been liberated by\r\nshaking. This last flask was examined on November 1st, 1873. Its aspect\r\nwas unchanged; the liquid was covered with _mycelium_ loaded with\r\nsporanges and borne up by large old bubbles that had not disappeared.\r\nThe following was the analysis of the liquid:—\r\n\r\n                         Alcohol           1·2\r\n                         Glucose          84·0\r\n                         Dextrine (?)     32·0\r\n\r\nThe liquid was very bright, and contained an amorphous granular deposit,\r\nformed by the wort after it had been boiled, at the time when we\r\nprepared our flasks. We crushed a small quantity of mycelium that had\r\nrisen to the surface of the liquid, and obtained a field such as is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 20. Amongst the ordinary filaments of mycelium\r\nbelonging to the plant, which are not represented in our engraving, and\r\nwhich were not more than 1/300 of a millimetre (nearly 1/7500 in.) in\r\ndiameter, we perceived much larger ones, swollen and contorted in the\r\nmost singular manner, and measuring as much as 1/50 of a millimetre\r\nacross their broadest parts. There was also a multitude of the ordinary\r\nspores of _aspergillus_ mixed with others of larger size, and big,\r\ninflated cells, with irregular or spherical protuberances, full of\r\ngranular matter. As there are all the stages between the normal spores\r\nof the plant and the big cells, and between these latter and the\r\nfilaments, it must be admitted that the whole of this strange vegetation\r\nresults from spores which change their structure under the influence of\r\nspecial conditions to which they are exposed.[62] Beyond all doubt these\r\ncells and irregularly shaped segments, in vegetating with difficulty,\r\ngave rise to the fermentation, which, although insignificant, was\r\nsufficiently marked to produce more than a gramme (15 grains) of\r\nalcohol. The oxygen of the air failing, or existing in insufficient\r\nquantity for the regular development of the filaments of mycelium\r\nbelonging to the plant, and for the germination of its submerged spores,\r\nfilaments and spores vegetated as the yeast of beer might have done if\r\ndeprived of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nIf we study the vegetation of _aspergillus glaucus_ with this\r\npreconceived idea, we shall soon recognize the fact that these spherical\r\nforms of mycelium are the result of a greater or less deprivation of\r\nair. The filaments of this mycelium which develop freely in the aerated\r\nliquid are young and transparent, small in diameter, and exhibit the\r\nordinary ramifications. Those which are situated about the centre, in\r\nthe denser or more complicated parts, to which the oxygen cannot\r\npenetrate in consequence of its absorption by the surrounding parts, are\r\nmore granular in appearance as well as larger, and inclined to develop\r\nswellings. We can observe no _conidia_[63] on these filaments, but we\r\nmay say that they are on the point of appearing, for the spherical\r\nsegments often tend to assume an appearance of close jointing, as when\r\nthey take the form of those rows of swelling, or cells, which has given\r\nrise to the idea of the _chaplets of the conidia-cellules_. This is\r\nrepresented in the accompanying sketches (Fig. 21), which we have\r\npurposely contrasted with two similar ones which relate to the _mucor_,\r\nof which we shall soon speak. The _conidia_ of these latter are very\r\nremarkable, and their fermentative character becomes apparent as soon as\r\ntheir growths are deprived of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21 A. Growth with abundant air-supply at the edge of\r\nthe mycelium crust.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21 B. Growth with reduced air-supply in the central\r\nand deeper parts of the mycelium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21 C. Growth with abundant air-supply at the edge of\r\nthe mycelium tuft.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21 D. Growth with reduced air-supply in the central\r\nand deeper parts.]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that in these vegetations of\r\naspergillus, which were accompanied by a corresponding alcoholic\r\nfermentation, it was impossible to find cells of yeast; and that,\r\nnotwithstanding this, the liquid was so adapted to ordinary alcoholic\r\nfermentation, that, when we added a small quantity of yeast to it, in\r\nthe course of a few hours, a most active alcoholic fermentation declared\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe may give some other facts relating to a crop of _aspergillus glaucus_\r\nwhich was also grown in ordinary hopped wort, and which was left to\r\nitself for a year.\r\n\r\nA two-necked flask, holding 300 c.c. (rather more than 10 fl. oz.) was\r\nprepared and impregnated on December 21st, 1873, and was then placed in\r\nan oven at a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.). The fungoid growth\r\ndeveloped in isolated tufts, which subsequently united, but without\r\nentirely covering the surface of the wort. A few tufts also vegetated at\r\nthe bottom of the liquid; those on the surface soon became surrounded by\r\nlarge bubbles of gas.\r\n\r\nOn December 12th, 1874, we examined the liquid and the plant, which for\r\na long time had appeared dead. Its mycelium was formed of aged,\r\ngranulated filaments, with few swellings. The weight of the dry fungoid\r\ngrowth was 0·50 gramme (about 8 grains) for a total volume of liquid of\r\n122 c.c. (4-1/4 fluid ounces). We obtained 4·4 c.c. of alcohol of 15°,\r\nwhich was about seven times the weight of the plant. Finally, we\r\ndetermined the acidity of the liquid, and found 2·8 grammes, in\r\nequivalents of sulphuric acid, a quantity greatly in excess of the total\r\nacidity of an equal volume of wort, a fact which shows us that\r\nfermentation caused by _aspergillus glaucus_ is accompanied by the\r\nformation of an organic acid, the nature of which it would be\r\ninteresting to determine. M. Gayon has commenced the study of this\r\nsubject in our laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn concluding our observations on the _aspergillus glaucus_, we may give\r\nthe comparative results of two growths that were obtained under\r\nprecisely similar conditions, in flasks of exactly the same size, but\r\ndiffering in this respect—that one of them was constantly subjected to a\r\ncurrent of pure air that played on the liquid. In the course of a few\r\ndays, when the fungoid growth in the flask that had been aerated had\r\nattained a considerable size, in comparison with the other, we broke the\r\nflasks in order that we might take out the two growths and compare their\r\nweights. After drying them at 100° C. (212° F.) we found:—\r\n\r\n             Growth in the aerated flask              0·92\r\n             Growth in the closed flask               0·16\r\n             Ratio of weights, 92/16 =  5·75.\r\n\r\nAgain, although we had taken the precaution of condensing in a U tube,\r\nover which cold water played, the vapours carried away by the current of\r\nair, the liquid in the aerated flask gave no evidence of alcohol. That\r\nin the other flask contained a very appreciable quantity, although the\r\nweight of fungoid growth in that flask was scarcely a sixth part of what\r\nit was in the other.\r\n\r\nThe preceding facts taken altogether, seem to us to demonstrate once\r\nmore, in the most conclusive manner:—\r\n\r\nFirstly, That neither _penicillium_ nor _aspergillus glaucus_ can change\r\ninto yeast, even under conditions that are most favourable to the life\r\nof that ferment.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That a fungoid growth which vegetates by using the oxygen of\r\nthe air, and which derives from the oxidating action of that gas, the\r\nheat that it requires to enable it to perform the acts necessary to its\r\nnutrition, may continue to live, although with difficulty, in the\r\nabsence of oxygen; that, in such a case, the forms of its mycelian or\r\nsporic vegetation undergo a change, the plant, at the same time,\r\nevincing a great tendency to act as alcoholic ferment, that is to say,\r\ndecomposing sugar and forming carbonic acid gas, alcohol, and other\r\nsubstances which we have not determined, and which probably vary with\r\ndifferent growths.\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, is one interpretation of the facts that we have\r\nreviewed. The observations in the following paragraphs and chapters may\r\nthe more incline our readers to accept it as the true one.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II.—Growth of Mycoderma Vini in a state of Purity—Confirmation of our\r\noriginal Conjectures as to the cause of Fermentation—Mycoderma Vini does\r\n   not Change into Yeast, although it may give rise to Fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efflorescence of wine, cider, and beer is pretty generally\r\nknown.[64] Fermented liquors cannot be exposed to the air without soon\r\nbecoming covered with a white film, which grows thick and becomes\r\nwrinkled in a marked manner in proportion as it is deprived of room\r\nwherein to spread horizontally, in accord with the extraordinary\r\nmultiplication of the cellules that compose it. The rapidity of this\r\nmultiplication is sometimes astounding. During the heat of summer, when\r\nthe medium is well adapted to the life of the plant, we may count the\r\nnumber of cells which grow in the course of a few hours by millions. The\r\nabsorption of the oxygen necessary to the activity of this growth, and\r\nthe heat developed in the film, as well as the liberation of carbonic\r\nacid gas, that result from it are considerable. A piece of glass\r\ncovering the mycoderma, at some distance above it, becomes wet with\r\nmoisture, that soon accumulates to form large drops of water. The\r\nquantity of oxygen absorbed is so great that we never see any other\r\nfungoid growth on the surface of this film, although the air is\r\nconstantly depositing on it, as dust, spores of an entirely different\r\ncharacter; for, notwithstanding that the warm and moist surface is in\r\ncontact with an atmosphere that is being continually renewed, yet the\r\n_mycoderma_ appropriates to itself all the oxygen contained in the air.\r\nWhen, however, the vegetation begins to languish, we often find, on the\r\nother hand, that the plant becomes associated with other species of\r\nmycoderma, notably _mycoderma aceti_, as well as other fungi, amongst\r\nwhich _penicillium glaucum_ generally appears. This is one of the facts\r\nwhich, wrongly interpreted, have led to the belief that _mycoderma vini_\r\nor _cerevisiæ_ may possibly, or even readily, become transformed into\r\n_penicillium_, and _vice versâ_.[65] As the study of the growth of\r\n_mycoderma vini_ on the surface of saccharine liquids and in their\r\ndepths, unaccompanied by any other species, has the most important\r\nbearing on the theory of alcoholic fermentation, we may pursue it\r\nthrough a few examples with all the detail that it allows of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, 1872, we sowed some _mycoderma vini_ in three flasks, with\r\ndouble necks, A, B, C (Fig. 22), containing some wort. The spores\r\nemployed for the purpose were obtained from plants growing on sweetened\r\nyeast-water in an ordinary closed flask. This had been impregnated with\r\nspores from plants grown on wort, which in turn had sprung from spores\r\ntaken directly from _mycoderma vini_ growing on wine.\r\n\r\nThe several impregnations were effected by means of a platinum wire,\r\nheld by forceps, both having been first cleaned by passing through\r\nflame, and then smeared with the fungoid films.\r\n\r\nBy this series of growings in closed vessels, which were but momentarily\r\nopen at the time when we dropped the spores into them, we secured the\r\nseparation of the mycoderma from all foreign organisms; and more\r\nparticularly from germs of _mycoderma aceti_, which is generally found\r\nalong with it, but which propagates with difficulty in neutral\r\nsaccharine liquids.\r\n\r\nOn the following days films of _mycoderma vini_ had spread over the\r\nsurface of the liquid in the three flasks. To all appearance they were\r\nvery pure; and the microscope showed the complete absence of any mixture\r\nof _mycoderma aceti_, lactic ferment, or other foreign growths.[66]\r\n\r\nOn June 26th we decanted and distilled the liquid in A without finding\r\nany trace of alcohol. We shook up the liquids in B and C, with all due\r\nprecautions, so as to submerge their films as much as possible, and then\r\nwe raised the temperature of the flasks to 26° C. or 28° C. (82° F.).\r\nFor some days afterwards we saw a constant succession of minute bubbles\r\nof carbonic acid gas rising through the liquid, which remained bright\r\nunder the part of the film that had not fallen in. It had all the\r\nappearance of a slow but continuous fermentation.\r\n\r\nOn June 29th we decanted and distilled the liquid in B, and found in it\r\nan appreciable quantity of alcohol, which showed itself in the first\r\ndistillation. The flask C, which was shaken afresh, continued to give\r\nsigns of fermentation, but, some days later, the evolution of the\r\nbubbles ceased.\r\n\r\nOn July 15th, 1873, we examined the flask with its film and its deposit\r\nof _mycoderma vini_, without finding a trace of any foreign growths,\r\neither in the shape of _penicillium glaucum_, or _mucor mucedo_, or\r\n_rhyzopus nigrans_, or _mycoderma aceti_, or, in short, any of the\r\norganisms which could not have failed to appear on the surface of a\r\nsubstratum so peculiarly adapted to their development, had it been in\r\nthe nature of _mycoderma vini_ to transform itself into one or other of\r\nthose common fungoid growths. The liquid, moreover, still remained\r\nsweet, and did not contain any cells of actual yeast. We may conclude\r\nthen that when one or more of these fungi occur, after an interval of\r\nsome days, in a growth of _mycoderma vini_ conducted in contact with\r\ncommon air, it does so in consequence of that air having, without the\r\nknowledge of the observer, impregnated the liquid spontaneously with\r\ngerms of these foreign organisms.\r\n\r\nThere might perhaps be room for some fear that the conditions of growth\r\nin our flasks were not favourable to the simultaneous appearance of\r\nthese common fungoid growths along with the _mycoderma vini_. On June\r\n24th, 1872, we sowed, in three flasks of sugared yeast-water, prepared\r\nas before—in the first, _mycoderma vini_, together with _penicillium\r\nglaucum_; in the second, _mycoderma vini_, together with _mucor mucedo_;\r\nin the third, _mycoderma vini_ alone.\r\n\r\nWe effected this by plunging the platinum wire, which we used for\r\nimpregnating the liquids, into the pure film of _mycoderma vini_, and\r\nthen touching with the wire the sporanges of the other fungus. On June\r\n29th, we saw on the surface of our first flask some green patches of\r\n_penicillium_, along with some spots of _mycoderma vini_; in the second\r\nflask a voluminous mycelium of _mucor mucedo_, distended by large\r\nbubbles, had risen to the surface of the liquid, and was entirely\r\ncovered by a film of _mycoderma vini_. As for the liquid in the third\r\nflask, there were only a few spots of very pure _mycoderma vini_. This\r\nlast flask, after being kept in an oven at 25° C. (77° F.) for several\r\nmonths, still contained nothing but _mycoderma vini_, unmixed with any\r\nother fungoid growth whatever.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore be sure that _mycoderma vini_, vegetating on the\r\nsurface of liquids adapted to its nutrition, in contact with air\r\ndeprived of its germinating dust, will not present the least sign of a\r\ntransformation into any of these other common fungi, or into yeast,\r\nhowever long may be the duration of its exposure to contact with that\r\npure air.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to that feeble and limited production of carbonic acid\r\ngas and alcohol, the formation of which we have shown experimentally to\r\ntake place at a high temperature, after submerging the film of\r\n_mycoderma vini_.[67] There can be no doubt that we have here a\r\nphenomenon similar in every point to that presented by _penicillium_ and\r\n_aspergillus_, which we studied in the preceding paragraph. When the\r\ngerms or jointed filaments of _mycoderma vini_, growing on a saccharine\r\nsubstratum in contact with the air, are in the full activity of life,\r\nthis activity is carried on at the expense of the sugar and other\r\nmaterials in the liquid, in the same way that animals consume the oxygen\r\nof the air and evolve carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of the different materials is attended with a\r\nproportionate formation of new materials, development of structure, and\r\nreproduction of organisms.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, not only does the _mycoderma vini_ not form a\r\nsufficiency of alcohol for analytical determination, but, if any alcohol\r\nexists in the subjacent liquid, the _mycoderma_ consumes it, converting\r\nit into water and carbonic acid gas, by fixation of the oxygen of the\r\nair.[68] If, however, we suddenly submerge the _mycoderma_, we shall\r\nobtain a different result. If, on the one hand, the conditions of life\r\nof this fungus are incompatible with the altered circumstances in which\r\nit is placed, the plant must perish, just as an animal does when\r\ndeprived of oxygen. But if, in spite of these changed conditions of\r\nnutrition, it can still continue in life, we should expect to see marked\r\nchanges in its organic structure, or chemical metamorphoses. The result\r\nof our observations points to the continuance of life, in a distinct\r\nthough sluggish and fugacious activity, accompanied by the phenomena of\r\nalcoholic fermentation, that is, the evolution of carbonic acid gas, and\r\nthe production of alcohol.\r\n\r\nIf we take a drop of liquid charged with disjointed cells of\r\n_mycoderma_, a day or two immediately after the submersion of the film,\r\nwe shall observe changes, small but appreciable, in the aspect of a\r\ngreat number of these cells; they will show increase in size, their\r\nprotoplasm will be in process of modification, and many of them will\r\nhave put forth little buds. It will be quite evident, however, that\r\nthese acts of interior nutrition and the changes of tissue resulting\r\nfrom them, proceed with difficulty; the buds when they form will soon\r\nwither, and there will be no multiplication of new cells. These changes\r\nwill, nevertheless, be accompanied by the decomposition of sugar into\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIn comparing these facts with those which we have pointed out in\r\nconnection with the cultivation of _penicillium_ and _aspergillus_, we\r\nare compelled to admit that the production of alcohol and carbonic acid\r\ngas from sugar—in one word, alcoholic fermentation—is a chemical action,\r\nconnected with the vegetable life of cells which may differ greatly in\r\ntheir nature, and that it takes place at the moment when these cells,\r\nceasing to have the power of freely consuming the materials of their\r\nnutrition by respiratory processes—that is, by the absorption of free\r\noxygen—continue to live by utilizing oxygenated matters which, like\r\nsugar or such unstable substances, produce heat by their decomposition.\r\nThe character of ferment thus presents itself to us, not as being\r\npeculiar to any particular being or to any particular organ, but as a\r\ngeneral property of the living cell. This character is always ready to\r\nmanifest itself, and, in reality, does manifest itself as soon as life\r\nceases to perform its functions under the influence of free oxygen, or\r\nwithout a quantity of that gas sufficient for all the acts of nutrition.\r\nThus we should see it appear and disappear concomitantly with that mode\r\nof life; feeble and fugacious in its action when the conditions of this\r\nvitality are of a similarly restricted character; intense, on the other\r\nhand, and of long duration and productive of large quantities of\r\ncarbonic acid gas and alcohol, when the conditions are such that the\r\nplant or cell can multiply with facility in this novel manner. To this\r\nwe may attribute all possible degrees of activity in fermentation, as\r\nwell as the existence of ferments of every variety of form and of very\r\ndifferent species. It may readily be imagined that sugar may undergo\r\ndecomposition in a quite different manner from that of which we have\r\nspoken, that instead of alcohol, carbonic acid gas, glycerine, and\r\nsimilar substances, it may yield lactic, butyric, acetic, and other\r\nacids. It would be only one definite class of cellular organisms, the\r\nmembers of which resembled each other more or less, that decomposed\r\nsugar into alcohol and carbonic acid; others, specifically different,\r\nwould act in a different manner. In short, we may say that the number of\r\nthese living organisms is a measure of the number of different ferments.\r\n\r\nPlate IV. represents in its two halves the condition of the _mycoderma\r\nvini_ at two different and unequal periods after its submersion. In the\r\nleft-hand semi-circle, it is evident that many of the figures are\r\nswollen, that modification of their protoplasm has taken place, and\r\nincipient budding is going on in several of them. A budding of this kind\r\nwould not wither; the buds would grow and, detaching themselves, would\r\nform new cells capable of budding in their turn. We should have under\r\nour eyes all the characteristics of a yeast, which, beyond doubt, would\r\ngive rise to a very active fermentation, inasmuch as it would belong to\r\nthe order of phenomena of nutrition and vital energy of which we are\r\nspeaking. Instead, however, of insisting upon the acceptance of our\r\ninterpretations, based on a few facts merely, let us go on to accumulate\r\nfacts, varying the conditions as much as possible. Our examples, taken\r\nsingly, may seem insufficient to establish the theory that it will be\r\nour endeavour to substantiate, but taken together we trust that they\r\nwill secure our readers’ confidence.\r\n\r\nWe may now, perhaps with advantage, introduce two new expressions to\r\nembody the preceding facts, by the help of which we may often shorten\r\nour subsequent explanations. Since life can continue, under certain\r\nconditions, away from contact with the oxygen of the air, and since the\r\naltered nutrition is accompanied by a phenomenon which is of great\r\nscientific as well as industrial importance, we may divide living beings\r\ninto two classes, _aërobian_, that is those which cannot live without\r\nair, and _anaërobian_, which, strictly speaking, and for a time, can do\r\nwithout it; these latter would be ferments, properly so called. Again,\r\nsince we can conceive, in an entire organism, some organ or even a cell\r\ncapable of existing, at least momentarily, apart from the influence of\r\nthe air, and endowed at a given moment with the character of a ferment,\r\nwe may, in like manner, make use of the expression _anaërobian_ cell, in\r\nopposition to a cell that is _aërobian_.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1863, in our work on putrefaction, we proposed to adopt\r\nthe preceding expressions, and since then we have had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing them used by different authors in France and other countries.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal assertions in this paragraph relates to the\r\nnon-transformation of _mycoderma vini_ into other moulds or into\r\nyeast.[69]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 4. Mycoderma Vini functioning as an Alcoholic\r\nFerment.—Right Half, showing Appearance of Spores just Sown; Left Half,\r\ntheir Appearance after an Interval of Submerged Life.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time, like Turpin and many other observers, although we had\r\nno belief in the transformation of _mycoderma vini_ into any one of the\r\ncommon moulds, yet we did believe in its transformation into alcoholic\r\nferment. In the course of more elaborate researches, however, we at last\r\ndiscovered that our previous experiments had been vitiated from the same\r\nsource of error which we have so often had occasion to point out as\r\naffecting the observations of our opponents, namely, the fortuitous and\r\nspontaneous introduction, unknown to the experimentalist, of germs of\r\nthe very plant for whose appearance by way of transformation he is\r\nseeking.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that every fermented vinous liquor, when put on\r\ndraught, is liable to efflorescence, it is difficult to avoid the\r\nsupposition that this efflorescence is primarily due to cells of the\r\nyeast that has caused the liquid to ferment, from which cells the\r\nliquid could not be completely freed, no matter how bright it might\r\nhave been, and which come to the surface of the liquid to live after\r\nthe manner of fungoid growths. We wished to test this supposition by\r\nmeans of experiments. So great, however, was the resemblance between\r\nthe forms possible to yeast and mycoderma, of which latter\r\nefflorescence is really composed, that we quite despaired of being\r\nable to solve the question by microscopical examination, that is, by\r\nobserving the actual conversion of a cell of yeast into a cell of\r\nmycoderma. In order, then, to overcome that difficulty, we endeavoured\r\nto produce an inverse transformation—that of mycoderma into yeast. We\r\nimagined that we should doubtless obtain this result by submerging\r\nsome of the efflorescence of wine or beer in a saccharine liquid well\r\nadapted to alcoholic fermentation. By submerging the mycoderma we\r\nwould do away with the ordinary conditions of life in this kind of\r\nfungoid growth; for we would thus prevent the supply of oxygen from\r\nthe air, since that oxygen would always be excluded, in the most\r\neffectual manner possible, by the portion of mycoderma that would\r\nremain on the surface of the liquid, even after the submersion\r\nprocess; and on the other hand, we would be subjecting our growth to\r\nthe ordinary conditions of ferment life, which acts at the bottom or\r\nin the bulk of liquids fermenting.\r\n\r\nOur experiments were conducted in the following manner:—In some flat\r\nporcelain basins, we grew some pure _mycoderma vini_[70] on fermented\r\nliquids, such as wine or beer, or on artificially vinous liquids, such\r\nas alcoholized yeast-water, taking care to boil these liquids previously\r\nto kill any germs of yeast or other organism that they might contain.\r\nThe basins themselves, as well as the plates of glass with which they\r\nwere to be covered, were plunged into boiling water just before they\r\nwere wanted for use. As soon as the film of mycoderma had become well\r\ndeveloped and thick, and even wrinkled—a process requiring not more than\r\ntwo or three days during summer heat—we decanted the subjacent liquid,\r\nby means of a siphon, so as to leave the film on the bottom of the\r\nbasin. We then diffused the whole mass of efflorescence in a saccharine\r\nliquid that had been boiled and afterwards cooled down in a closed\r\nvessel; generally, we used wort or must preserved by Appert’s process.\r\nAfter that, we emptied the mixture of saccharine liquid and\r\nefflorescence into long-necked flasks that had likewise been previously\r\nheated, as also had the funnels used in the process of transference.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to us that experiments conducted with all these precautions\r\nmust be free from causes of error. It was true that we were working more\r\nor less in contact with atmospheric air, but all that we had to fear for\r\nthe soundness of the conclusions which we might draw was the presence of\r\ngerms of alcoholic ferment, and we considered how few of these there are\r\namongst floating particles of dust. Consequently, if we succeeded in\r\nobserving the advent of yeast in each of the long-necked flasks,\r\naccompanied by an active alcoholic fermentation, we thought that we\r\nmight, without danger of error, admit as a fact the transformation of\r\ncells of mycoderma into cells of yeast. Again, we thought that we should\r\nprobably find in the forms of the cells of yeast which were directly\r\nderived from the cells of mycoderma, a more or less elongated structure,\r\nwhich would be a convincing proof of the transformation that we were\r\nseeking, if, indeed, such transformation were possible.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, everything happened in a manner that seemed to realize\r\nour expectations. The saccharine worts in the flasks in which we had\r\nmixed and submerged the mycoderma, fermented in the course of a few\r\ndays; the yeast first appeared in elongated shapes; lastly, we could see\r\nunder the microscope that many of the cells or jointed filaments of\r\nmycoderma were inflated and presented the appearance of undoubted\r\ngradations between their natural state and that of the cells of yeast\r\nwhich soon formed part of the deposit in the vessels. In spite of all\r\nthis, however, we were the victims of an illusion.\r\n\r\nIn experiments conducted as we have just described, the yeast which\r\nappears, and which soon sets up an active alcoholic fermentation, is\r\nintroduced in the first place by atmospheric air, from which germs are\r\nconstantly falling either upon the film of mycoderma or upon the objects\r\nthat are employed in the successive manipulations. Two peculiarities in\r\nthese experiments first opened our eyes to the existence of this cause\r\nof error. We sometimes found at the bottom of the flasks in which we had\r\nsubmerged the efflorescence, along with the cells of mycoderma, large,\r\nspherical cells of _mucor mucedo_ or _racemosus_, ferment-cells that we\r\nshall soon learn to recognize in studying this curious fungoid growth.\r\nThe existence of _mucor mucedo_ or _racemosus_, where we had only sown\r\n_mycoderma vini_, was to us a proof that one or more spores of that\r\nmucor had been introduced by the surrounding air. If then, we reasoned,\r\nthe air can introduce spores of mucor into our field of operations, why\r\nshould it not introduce cells of yeast, especially in our laboratory?\r\nAgain, it sometimes happened that a negative result was obtained.\r\nHarassed by doubts about the reality of this transformation, which\r\naccorded so well with, the physiological theory of fermentation we had\r\nbeen led to adopt, we repeated the experiments many times, and in some\r\ncases we failed to detect any appearance whatever of a transformation of\r\nmycoderma into yeast cells, although the conditions under which each of\r\nthe experiments was conducted had been as similar as could be.\r\n\r\nWe were at a loss to account for this inactivity in the cells of the\r\nmycoderma. Even in the most favourable cases of the supposed\r\nfermentation, it was evident that a host of cells of _mycoderma vini_\r\ndid not become cells of yeast; but how could it possibly be admitted\r\nthat amongst the millions of submerged cells, none were adapted for\r\ntransformation, if that transformation were at all possible?\r\n\r\nThereupon, to find a way out of the difficulty, we resolved to modify\r\ncompletely the conditions of our experiments, and to apply to the\r\nresearch that we had in view a mode of cultivation that might\r\ncompletely, or nearly so, obviate the sole cause of error that we\r\nsuspected, namely, the possible fall of cells or germs of yeast during\r\nthe manipulations. We secured this by the use of flasks with two tubes,\r\nthe right hand one of which was closed by means of a piece of\r\nindia-rubber tubing with a glass stopper, the other one being drawn out\r\nin the shape of a swan’s neck. The use of these flasks, which was then\r\nnew to us, permitted us to grow mycoderma and to study it under the\r\nmicroscope without fear of disturbance from exterior particles of dust.\r\nThis time we obtained the results given in the first part of this\r\nparagraph. We no longer observed yeast or alcoholic fermentation\r\nfollowing the submersion of the efflorescence, either in the flasks\r\nthemselves, or in the test-flasks attached to them, as represented in\r\nFig. 19. We observed, however, that kind of alcoholic fermentation of\r\nwhich we have already spoken and which is due to the mycoderma itself, a\r\nfermentative action that is still more instructive than the one which we\r\nthought we had determined, and certainly not less calculated to support\r\nthe theory of fermentation which we have already briefly sketched.\r\n\r\nIn an age when ideas involving transformation of species are so readily\r\naccepted, perhaps in consequence of their requiring no rigorous\r\nexperimental work, it is not without interest to consider that, in the\r\ncourse of our researches upon the growths of microscopic plants in a\r\nstate of purity, we once were inclined to believe in the transformation\r\nof one organism into another—the transformation of _mycoderma vini_ or\r\n_cerevisiæ_ into yeast, and that, on that occasion, we were altogether\r\nwrong, through having ourselves fallen a victim to the identical source\r\nof error which confidence in our theory of germs had led us so\r\nfrequently to detect as affecting the observations of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n         § III.—Growth of Mycoderma Aceti in a State of Purity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of _mycoderma aceti_ has not escaped the numerous causes of\r\nerror which are apt to attend all observations made on microscopic\r\norganisms. This little fungus is still believed by many authors to be\r\none of those polymorphous species capable of great modifications,\r\naccording to the conditions of their cultivation—it could be, in turns,\r\nbacterium, vibrio, yeast, &c. Respecting it, we have seen resuscitated\r\nunder a modern name, in the course of the last few years, the old\r\nhypothesis of Buffon concerning _organic molecules_, that of Turpin\r\nconcerning the _punctiform globulines_ of barley, milk, and albumen, and\r\nthe theory maintained by Dr. Pineau, of Nancy, and by Pouchet concerning\r\n_proliferous pellicles_.[71]\r\n\r\nM. Béchamp, Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at Montpellier,\r\ndisdaining to adopt the expressions which we have just used, has\r\nsubstituted for them that of _microzyma_, whilst adhering to the\r\nopinions and errors represented by the other expressions. This savant\r\ndesignates under the name of _microzyma_ all those punctiform globulines\r\nthat are met with in most organic liquids when submitted to the\r\nmicroscope; and attributes to them, with Turpin, the faculty of playing\r\nthe part of ferments, as well as of transforming themselves into yeast\r\nand various other organisms. They are contained in milk, blood, eggs,\r\nthe infusion of barley, and such like; nay, we may even find them in\r\nchalk, and so we have the fine discovery of _Microzyma cretae_ as a\r\ndistinct species!\r\n\r\nThose who, like ourselves, cannot see in these granulations of organic\r\nliquids ought besides things whose nature is still undetermined, term\r\nthem _molecular granules_, or, in reference to their Brownian movements,\r\n_mobile granules_. Indefinite expression is the best exponent of\r\nimperfect knowledge; when a precise terminology is invented, without any\r\nbasis of precise ideas derived from a rigid observation of facts, sooner\r\nor later the hypothetical facts disappear, but the terminology\r\nprematurely created to explain them, hangs about the Science, and,\r\nbearing an erroneous interpretation, retards rather than promotes real\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nWe may here introduce a summary of Turpin’s system, as given by himself.\r\nIt forms a complete biogenesis, which leaves far behind it M. Béchamp’s\r\ntheory of _microzymata_, M. Fremy’s descriptions of _hemi-organism_, and\r\nM. Trécul’s account of the genesis of bacteria and lactic ferment:—\r\n\r\n“When a mucous substance presents nothing visible through the\r\nmicroscope, as, for example, gelatinous matter, dissolved gum, the white\r\nof eggs, or plant-sap, simply thickened on its way to _cambium_, we call\r\nit _organic matter_ or _organizable matter_. We attribute to it the\r\nfecundating power of organic life in the simplest degree; we consider it\r\nas material still isolated from organization. We suppose that the\r\ninvisible molecules, of which this organizable matter is composed, come\r\ntogether, combine and serve through this association in the construction\r\nof the different elementary forms of future tissues.\r\n\r\n“May we not with greater truth believe that organizable matter is of\r\nvaried origin, formed of innumerable globulines, too minute and\r\ntransparent as yet to be observed by our present microscopical means,\r\nand that these globulines which are always endowed with motion and a\r\nspecial vital centre, are all capable, although many of them _do_ abort,\r\nof separate development either into a formative element of tissue or\r\ninto a mucedinous plant?\r\n\r\n“Organizable matter may, according to its successive states of\r\ndevelopment or age, and according to the different forms it takes in the\r\ntissues, be distinguished by special names:—\r\n\r\n“1.—We may term matter _organizable_ as long as the globulines composing\r\nit are not yet visible to microscopes of existing power.\r\n\r\n“2.—We may speak of _amorphous_ or _globuline tissue_ when even the\r\nglobulines, previously invisible, have increased so as to be seen under\r\nthe microscope, the term amorphous, or shapeless, being here applied to\r\nthe association of globulines, and not to the globulines themselves.\r\n\r\n“3.—Then we have _vesicular tissue_, when the globulines, continuing to\r\nincrease, have developed in such a manner as to present a mass of\r\ncontinuous vesicles, still empty or already containing a new generation\r\nof globulines.\r\n\r\n“4.—Lastly we have _filamentous_ or _tubular tissue_, when the\r\nglobulines, instead of vesiculating, form threads or tubes.”[72]\r\n\r\nSuch are the purely hypothetical and exploded ideas which MM. Fremy,\r\nTrécul, Béchamp, H. Hoffmann, Hallier, and others would revive in our\r\nown day, in opposition to a theory so clear and so well supported by\r\nfacts as that of germs floating in the air, or spread over the surface\r\nof objects, as fruits, dry or green wood, and so on.\r\n\r\nM. Béchamp believes that he has discovered that _mother of vinegar_,\r\nintroduced into various saccharine liquids, in the presence of carbonate\r\nof lime, generates bacteria, which, with the sugar or dregs, produce\r\nbutyric, lactic, and acetic acids, and that this same mother of vinegar,\r\nwithout the addition of the carbonate of lime, “generates, on the other\r\nhand, the fine cells, which produce the normal alcoholic fermentation of\r\ncane sugar.” Further, M. Béchamp advances the hypothesis that mother of\r\nvinegar is a conglomeration of _microzymata_, and, as he fails to see in\r\nthe experiments on which he bases the conclusions which we have just\r\ngiven, that bacteria and ferment cells are the result of spontaneous\r\nimpregnation, having no connection with the presence of mother of\r\nvinegar, on which he experimented, he arrives at this conclusion: “In\r\nthe experiments which I have just described, things happened as though\r\nthe microzyma, under some peculiarly favourable conditions, had been the\r\nparent both of the bacteria and the cells.”[73] ...\r\n\r\nThe object of the following experiments was the study of these assumed\r\ntransformations of the _mycoderma aceti_ in saccharine liquids, in the\r\npresence and in the absence of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nWe prepared some two-necked flasks, containing as a growing medium a\r\nliquid composed of one-third of Orleans vinegar, and two-thirds of a\r\nwhite wine used by vinegar-makers in Orleans. This liquid is peculiarly\r\nadapted to the development of _mycoderma aceti_.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th, 1872, we sowed the little plant in a state of purity,\r\nby means of a piece of platinum wire, in the manner already explained in\r\nconnection with propagation of other fungoid growths. On December 19th a\r\nyoung and thin film of _mycoderma aceti_ covered the surface of the\r\nliquid. We then poured out the liquid through the right-hand tube, at\r\nthe same time heating the end of the bent tube, to purify the air that\r\npassed into the flask. The whole film of _mycoderma aceti_ remained\r\nadhering to the interior sides of the flask during this decanting. The\r\nquestion then was how to convey this film of the little plant into a\r\nsaccharine liquid of a particular kind. We effected this easily by the\r\nfollowing means: After having emptied the flask, as just described,\r\ninstead of re-closing the india-rubber nozzle on the end of the\r\nright-hand tube, we attached it to a test-flask containing the\r\nsaccharine liquid on which we wished to operate. This had been\r\npreviously boiled in the test-flask, and when we attached the neck of\r\nthe test-flask, previously slightly drawn out and curved, to the\r\nindia-rubber tube, the liquid was still very warm. We permitted the\r\nliquid in the test-flask to cool down, and, then, taking up the\r\ntest-flask, we decanted its contents into the other flask, in which, as\r\nwe have already said, the film of _mycoderma aceti_ had been left. In\r\nthis way the film became partly submerged, partly spread over the\r\nsurface of the new liquid. Experiments were made with two saccharine\r\nliquids, must and wort. In the case of the latter, from December 22nd\r\nthe whole surface of the liquid was covered by a film of _mycoderma\r\naceti_, which even spread up the moist sides of the flask above the\r\nlevel of the liquid. In the case of the must, on the other hand, the\r\nplant for some time did not seem to be developing; on December 24th,\r\nhowever, it was visibly spreading over the surface of the must. The\r\nfollowing days we frequently shook up the films to separate them, and\r\nspread them over the subjacent liquid. There were no signs of alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nOn December 30th we introduced several grammes (50 or 60 grains) of\r\ncarbonate of lime into each of the flasks, an operation of little\r\ndifficulty, which we effected in a manner similar to that just\r\ndescribed. We substituted for the test-flask another flask—or, better\r\nstill, a simple glass tube—containing carbonate of lime that had been\r\nsubjected to great heat in the flask or tube, and there left to cool\r\ndown. When cold, we poured the powdered carbonate of lime into the\r\nliquid in the flask, in this way avoiding the possibility of any error\r\nfrom the introduction with the carbonate of lime of any foreign germ.\r\n\r\nIn neither case did we obtain alcoholic fermentation, nor was there any\r\nappearance of lactic fermentation, or bacteria, or _vibrios_, properly\r\nso called. The flasks remained in the oven, at a temperature of about\r\n25° C. (77° F.), until the end of January, 1873, when we made a\r\nmicroscopical examination of their deposits, exercising greater care and\r\nprecaution than we had adopted in the case of those examinations which\r\nwe had made from time to time in the course of the experiment to assure\r\nourselves of the nature of the organisms present.[74] The result was\r\nthat we never found anything besides the _mycoderma aceti_, which had\r\ndeveloped, although with great difficulty, on the surface of the liquids\r\nneutralized with carbonate of lime. The beaded filaments had, under\r\nthese circumstances, only become a little larger than they had been in\r\nthe unsweetened acid liquids.\r\n\r\n_Mycoderma aceti_, then, grown on sweetened acid or neutral liquids,\r\ngrown in the absence or in the presence of carbonate of lime, undergoes\r\nno transformation into bacteria or vibrios or yeast, if only we operate\r\nwith pure germs, free from the dust floating in the air, and from that\r\nwhich, unknown to the operator, may be introduced by means of the\r\nvessels and materials employed. It may be asked, do we, therefore,\r\nabsolutely, reject the theory of the polymorphism of _mycoderma aceti_?\r\nOn the contrary, we have endeavoured to prove the existence of this\r\npolymorphism again and again in a variety of ways. We have been mostly\r\nconcerned with physiological polymorphism; that is, our efforts have\r\nbeen directed to ascertain if _mycoderma aceti_ might be, for example,\r\nthe _aërobian_ form of a ferment from which it differed physiologically,\r\nas, for instance, lactic ferment, which, in shape, sometimes bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to _mycoderma aceti_. We have not succeeded in\r\ndiscovering anything of the kind up to the present time.\r\n\r\nWhat, in view of the positive proofs to the contrary, we do absolutely\r\nreject in the matter of this mycoderma, is the theory of polymorphisms,\r\nadvocated by M. Béchamp and other authors, which, in our judgment, can\r\nonly be founded on incomplete and erroneous observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § IV.—Growth of Mucor Racemosus in a state of Purity—Example of Life\r\n    more active and lasting when removed from the influence of Air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide by side with the facts explained in the last paragraph, the study\r\nof varieties of the genus _mucor_, grown in natural or artificial\r\nsaccharine liquids, is of great importance to the establishment of the\r\nphysiological theory of fermentation, which we shall explain later on.\r\nThere is a very remarkable work on the subject of this mucedinous fungus\r\nby a German botanist, M. Bail, who, in 1857, declared that _mucor\r\nmucedo_ caused alcoholic fermentation, and could change into ordinary\r\nyeast. The first assertion, relating to the alcoholic fermentation that\r\nthis fungoid growth which is everywhere so abundant may cause, is quite\r\ncorrect; the second which relates to its faculty of changing into yeast\r\nis erroneous.[75]\r\n\r\nOn June 13th, 1872, we sowed by the help of a platinum wire in some\r\nwort, contained in two-necked flasks, A, B, and C, several of the minute\r\nsporange-bearing filaments of _mucor_ along with the heads containing\r\nthe spores.\r\n\r\nOn June 14th, there was no mycelium visible to the naked eye in the\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\nOn June 15th mycelium was very abundant, and was borne up by bubbles of\r\ngas. In addition to this there were a few scattered patches of bubbles\r\non the surface of the liquid, showing that fermentation had commenced.\r\n\r\nOn June 16th fermentation continued to show itself by the frothy state\r\nof the crusts of mycelium buoyed up by the bubbles of gas.\r\n\r\nOn June 17th we attached B and C separately, as indicated in Fig. 19 (p.\r\n101) to test-flasks, into which we transferred nearly all their\r\ncontents. Some clusters of entangled filaments of mycelium remained on\r\nthe surface of the liquids in the test-flasks.\r\n\r\nOn June 18th a very slow fermentation commenced in the test-flasks; it\r\ncontinued for some days without becoming more active. A little bubble\r\nwould slowly rise from the bottom of the vessel, succeeded after a short\r\ninterval by another, and so on. The temperature of the oven was 24° C.\r\n(75° F.). On June 22nd we raised it to 28° C. (82° F.). The fermentation\r\nbecame more rapid, a constant succession of bubbles rose quickly from\r\nthe bottom of the test-flasks; still there was none of the vivacity of\r\nan alcoholic fermentation produced by yeast.\r\n\r\nOn June 25th the fermentation was in much the same condition, if\r\nanything rather less active.\r\n\r\nOn June 28th temperature 25° C. (77° F); fermentation had stopped.\r\n\r\nOn June 29th we raised the temperature to 27° C. (81° F.) again, and\r\nsome slight revival of fermentation manifested itself.\r\n\r\nThe increase in temperature, therefore, as might have been expected,\r\nexercises a considerable influence on this kind of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe vessels were then left to themselves, and during the course of three\r\nmonths they did not show the least sign of fermentation; moreover, we\r\ndid not observe, either on the interior walls of the empty flasks, or on\r\nthe surface or throughout the body of the liquid in the test-glasses,\r\nany fungoid production or organism whatever different from _mucor_\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply to the vessel A; in this case the liquid\r\nthat remained in the flask was covered with a gelatinous and frothy\r\nmycelium.\r\n\r\nOn October 20th, 1872, after a lapse of three months and a half, we\r\npoured the liquid from the test-flask attached to flask C back again to\r\nthat flask. The test-flask connected with flask B we left untouched\r\nalongside the other flasks to serve as a means of comparison.\r\n\r\nOn October 21st, 22nd, 23rd, we observed nothing; on succeeding days,\r\nhowever, some patches of bubbles appeared on the surface of the liquid\r\nin flask C, and clusters of mycelium buoyed up by the bubbles of gas\r\nwhich they imprisoned. Life had resumed its course, and with life\r\nfermentation had recommenced. What had been the cause of this change in\r\nthe condition of the liquid, after an absolute quiescence of three\r\nmonths? There can be but one answer to this question: for in the other\r\nvessels there was no corresponding movement, or sign of life to be\r\ndetected. In this vessel, however, an aeration of the plant had\r\nevidently taken place, consequent on the decantation and contact with\r\nthe atmosphere of the flask, which communicated with the exterior air\r\nthrough the curved tube. This aeration had been absent or ineffective\r\nbefore decantation, in consequence of the great depth of liquid in the\r\ntest-flask, the surface of which, too, was covered by a mass of mycelium\r\nfilaments, itself effectually opposing any aeration of the liquid.\r\nMoreover, the surface of the liquid in the narrow neck of the test-flask\r\nhad necessarily been covered by a layer of carbonic acid gas. We may\r\ninvestigate more thoroughly the influence of aeration, and its relation\r\nto the resumption of life in the mycelium of _mucor_, by restoring the\r\nliquid to its previous condition of depth and so cutting off again\r\ncontact with the air.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, on October 31st we decanted once more the liquid and\r\nits deposit from the flask into the test-glass. The same evening a\r\nslight but continuous fermentation, with formation of froth, appeared on\r\nthe surface of the liquid in the neck of the test-glass. Fermentation\r\nalthough never vigorous, continued the following days, and until\r\nDecember 20th.\r\n\r\nBetween December 20th and 23rd, it ceased altogether to manifest itself\r\nby liberation of gas. As for the flask B, during all this time it had\r\nremained quite inactive and in the same state in which it had existed\r\nsince June 29th, although the oven had on several days been heated to\r\n28° C. (82° F.).\r\n\r\nOn December 23rd, 1872, wishing to assure ourselves of the state of the\r\nplant in flask B, we subjected it to the same operation to which the\r\nflask C had been subjected on October 20th: that is to say, we poured\r\nthe contents of the test-glass back into the connected flask, with the\r\nobject of supplying the plant with oxygen.\r\n\r\nOn December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, there was no apparent change.\r\n\r\nOn December 28th bubbles of gas began to be evolved carrying up clusters\r\nof mycelium to the surface of the liquid. It was evident, therefore,\r\nthat the quiescence in the test-glass attached to flask B, was solely\r\ndue to deprivation of air, as had happened in the case of the test-glass\r\nattached to flask C, up to the date of October 31st.\r\n\r\nOn this day, December 28th, we re-decanted the contents of the flask\r\ninto the test-glass, and the following day a continuous but feeble\r\nfermentation proceeded. This lasted until January 22nd, although very\r\nsluggish in character; it is evident that these effects were exactly the\r\nsame as those which took place in flask C.[76]\r\n\r\nWe should observe before we proceed further, that we took specimens from\r\nthe flasks A, B, C, at different times between June and January, and\r\nthat the microscope never revealed the least trace of yeast in them. We\r\nmay note besides that, during this interval, we impregnated fresh flasks\r\nof wort with specimens taken from the deposits in the flasks A, B, C,\r\nand that we always obtained reproduction of the _mucor_ and its peculiar\r\nfermentation without the least appearance of ordinary ferment.\r\n\r\nThe inferences from the results that we have just detailed follow\r\nreadily, and are besides of great interest. In the first place, it is\r\nevident that even if the _mucor mucedo_ may be able to produce alcoholic\r\nfermentation, it is totally incapable of changing into yeast. The two\r\nplants are necessarily and radically distinct, and, if different authors\r\nhave succeeded in obtaining them mixed one with another in growths of\r\n_mucor_, this intermixture was doubtless the result of a spontaneous\r\nsowing of the yeast, the germs of which abound, particularly in the\r\nparticles of dust existing in the atmosphere of any laboratory in which\r\nstudies relating to fermentation are pursued.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the most striking inference from the facts which\r\nthe cultivation of these organisms revealed. The _mucor_ is evidently a\r\nplant, at the same time _aërobian_ and _anaërobian_. If we had sown the\r\nspore-bearing filaments of _mucor_ on slices of pear, lemon, or similar\r\nfruit, we should have seen the spores germinate, tubes of mycelium\r\nramifying on the surface of the substratum, and reproducing sporiferous\r\naerial _hyphae_. In this case the plant would have effected all its\r\nphenomena of nutrition by absorbing oxygen and emitting carbonic acid,\r\nafter the manner of animals, as, in our essay on the organic corpuscles\r\nwhich exist in a state of suspension in the atmosphere, we have shown to\r\nbe the case generally with fungoid growths. Under these circumstances,\r\nthe only sugar decomposed would have been a quantity equivalent to that\r\nassimilated in forming the cellulose of the young tissues of the fungus,\r\nor in entering into combination, either with the elements of ammonia or\r\nwith the sulphur of the sulphates, or the phosphorus of the phosphates,\r\nto form the albuminous substances of the interior of the cells.[77] In\r\nthis case the sugar used up would furnish no alcohol, or at least, if\r\nalcohol were formed, it would be decomposed immediately. All _aerial_\r\ngrowths take place in the same manner; and such is the nature of\r\nnutrition and life in all the larger forms.\r\n\r\nIn our flasks, on the other hand, the life of the little plant functions\r\nquite differently. Deprived of oxygen, or having at its disposal but an\r\ninsufficient quantity of that gas, after a life of activity in contact\r\nwith air, it can, nevertheless, live apart from the direct action of\r\nthat element, and the combinations to which it gives rise. On the other\r\nhand, we see all the signs of alcoholic fermentation appear; that is, a\r\nnotable proportion of sugar, in comparison with the weight of solid\r\nmatter assimilated and fixed by the plant, is decomposed into alcohol\r\nand carbonic acid gas; and this decomposition continues as long as life\r\nitself continues in the cells, and they remain submerged, this last\r\ncondition being effected by the decantation of the liquid and its\r\ndeposit into the test-glass. Along with the disappearance of the\r\nphenomena of vital activity in the cells, the fermentation ceases\r\nabsolutely, or at least is no longer visible externally, by reason of\r\nits extreme feebleness. The cells then assume an old, shrivelled,\r\nworn-out appearance, with irregular outlines and granular markings.\r\nTheir life is merely suspended, however, not extinct; for if they be\r\nsupplied once more with oxygen, and suffered to exist under the\r\ninfluence of that gas, they will vegetate again, and become capable of\r\nproducing fermentation afresh, even after having been excluded from the\r\nair for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nOxygen then presents itself to us as being endowed with a certain\r\ndetermining stimulus in the matter of nutritive action enabling this\r\naction to be prolonged beyond the point where the direct influence of\r\noxygen ceases. In time the energy that has been imparted to the cells\r\nwill die away, and then also fermentation will cease, to be resumed,\r\nhowever, when the plant is once more submitted to the revivifying action\r\nof the gas. It seems as though the vital energy derived from the\r\ninfluence of gaseous oxygen were capable of effecting an assimilation of\r\noxygen, not in the gaseous state, but existing in some state of\r\ncombination, and hence its power of causing the decomposition of sugar.\r\nLooking at the matter in this light, it seems to us that we may discover\r\nin it a fact of general occurrence, that this peculiar action of the\r\noxygen and the cells is to be seen in all living beings. For indeed is\r\nthere any cell which, if suddenly and completely deprived of air, would\r\nperish forthwith, and absolutely? Probably there is not a single one\r\nthat would do so. With certain modifications of greater or less amount\r\nthe assimilative and excretive acts which have taken place during life\r\nmust be carried on after the suppression of oxygen, resulting in\r\nfermentations ordinarily obscure and feeble, but in the case of the\r\ncells of ferments, properly so called, manifesting an activity both\r\ngreater in amount and more enduring.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to compare the weight of alcohol formed by the\r\n_mucor_ during fermentation with the weight of the plant itself.\r\n\r\n_First experiment._—One of the double-necked flasks contained at\r\nstarting 120 c.c. (about 4 fl. oz.) of wort.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, 1873, we attached this flask to a test-glass, containing\r\na deposit of _mucor_ ferment (Fig. 19, p. 101), a few drops of which we\r\npoured into the wort in the flask, to impregnate it. On January 3rd we\r\ndecanted the wort from the flask into the test-glass; under these\r\nconditions we have seen that the wort must ferment.\r\n\r\nOn January 18th the fermentation in the test-glass ceased. On July 31st,\r\n1873, we transferred the liquid from the test-glass back to the flask.\r\nOn August 4th, 1873, we again decanted this same liquid from the flask\r\ninto the test-glass. On December 25th, 1873, we once more removed the\r\nliquid from the test-glass to the flask, and allowed it to remain so\r\nuntil December 23rd, 1874, on which day we submitted it to examination.\r\nIt was found to contain per 100 c.c. (3-½ fl. oz.)\r\n\r\n                                             Grains.   Grammes.[78]\r\n\r\n    Total weight of the fungus                   5·7           0·37\r\n\r\n    Absolute alcohol                            50·9            3·3\r\n\r\n    Acidity, estimated in its equivalent of      1·7           0·11\r\n    sulphuric acid\r\n\r\n    Sugar, determined by cupric solution        82·2            5·2\r\n\r\n    Dextrine (?)                                24·6            1·6\r\n\r\nThe total weight of fungoid growth being 0·37 gramme, and the total\r\nweight of absolute alcohol for the 120 c.c. of fermented liquid being 4\r\ngrammes, we had, consequently, from ten to eleven times by weight more\r\nalcohol than fungus.\r\n\r\n_Second experiment._—On June 13th, 1872, we sowed two or three\r\nsporiferous heads of _mucor_ in some wort contained in one of the\r\ndouble-necked flasks. The temperature of our oven varied between 23° C.\r\nand 25° C. (73° F. to 77° F.) The total volume of liquid was 120 c.c.,\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nJune 15th, mycelium had developed, buoyed up on bubbles of gas.\r\n\r\nJune 16th, patches of bubbles, due to fermentation, covered the surface\r\nof the liquid.\r\n\r\nJune 17th, we transferred the liquid to the test-glass.\r\n\r\nJune 28th, fermentation in the test-flask had ceased.\r\n\r\nJune 28th, fermentation recommenced, the temperature of the oven being\r\nraised to 27° C. (80° F.).\r\n\r\nOctober 20th, the liquid was transferred back from the test-glass to the\r\nflask.\r\n\r\nOctober 24th, mycelium had developed, supported by big bubbles on the\r\nsurface of the liquid in the flask.\r\n\r\nOctober 31st, we retransferred the liquid to the test-glass.\r\n\r\nNovember 1st, a feeble, but continuous fermentation commenced. This was\r\nkept up until January 2nd, 1873, on which day we transferred the liquid,\r\nwith its deposit from the test-glass to the flask, when it now seemed to\r\nbe quite inert. We left it in this flask until December 24th, 1874,\r\nwithout its manifesting during this long interval any sign of\r\nfermentation; nor did the fungus appear to grow at all.\r\n\r\nWe then submitted the liquid to analysis, and found in it, per 100 c.c.—\r\n\r\n                                                       Grammes.[79]\r\n\r\n    Total weight of fungoid growth                             0·25\r\n\r\n    Absolute alcohol                                            3·4\r\n\r\n    Acidity, estimated in its equivalent of sulphuric          0·12\r\n    acid\r\n\r\n    Sugar, determined by copper solution                        6·2\r\n\r\n    Sugar, determined after treatment by boiling with           1·0\r\n    sulphuric acid, and deduction of amount of sugar\r\n    already obtained (dextrine)?\r\n\r\nThe total weight of absolute alcohol for the 120 c.c. of fermented\r\nliquid was 4·1 grammes—that is, the weight of the alcohol was sixteen or\r\nseventeen times that of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 5. Mucor, Vegetating Submerged, in Deficit of Air.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the plant differs considerably when it lives surrounded\r\nby air, and when it is more or less completely deprived of that fluid.\r\nIf it has an abundance of air at its disposal, if it vegetates on the\r\nsurface of a moist substance or in a liquid in which the air held in\r\nsolution may be renewed without being incessantly displaced by carbonic\r\nacid gas, we shall see it develop as an ordinary fungoid growth, with a\r\nmycelium consisting of filaments more or less slender, branching, and\r\nentangled, sending up from the surface of the liquid aerial organs of\r\nfructification. This is the well-known form of vegetation of the common\r\n_mucor_. On the other hand, if we compel the _mucor_ to live in a\r\nsaccharine liquid with insufficiency of air, at least for some of its\r\nparts, the mode of vegetation will change completely, as we have seen in\r\nthe case of _penicillium_, _aspergillus_, and _mycoderma vini_ when\r\nsubmerged, but with this difference, that in the case of the _mucor_ the\r\nchanges in question, and the activity of nutrition under these new\r\nconditions, are much more marked than in the case of those other\r\norganisms. The spores grow larger and the filaments of mycelium which do\r\ndevelop are much stronger than those in the normal plant. These\r\nfilaments put forth, here and there, other filaments which detach\r\nthemselves and vegetate at the side of the others, being terminated or\r\ninterrupted by chains of large cells, species of spores which can live\r\nby budding and reproducing cells similar to themselves or by elongating\r\ninto filaments.\r\n\r\nPlate V. represents the living plant submerged at a little depth, and\r\nhaving, consequently, still at its disposal a certain quantity of air,\r\ninsufficient, however, to supply the oxygen needed for all the acts of\r\nnutrition. In this case the _mucor_ appears very different,\r\nmorphologically, from what it is when in free contact with air. Here it\r\nforms short filaments, having a diameter double or triple that of the\r\nfilaments of the ordinary mycelium with branches and buds all over, and\r\nwhat is especially characteristic, forming a network of chains of cells,\r\nsometimes spherical, sometimes oval or pear-shaped, which are the actual\r\nspores. These, as soon as they are detached, bud in their turn, and\r\nreproduce either cells or branching tubes; these cells or the chaplets\r\nwhich they form being known under the name _mycelian spores_ or\r\n_conidia_. Our plate gives these different aspects very correctly, and\r\naffords us a good idea of the luxuriant state of this remarkable\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nPlate VI. represents the plant living at a greater depth with less air,\r\nexpending, by means of sugar as source of heat, the energy which it\r\nacquired in vegetating under the influence of the oxygen of the air. The\r\nfilaments are fewer and older in aspect, and the number of cellular\r\nforms is proportionately larger than in the former case, the budding\r\ngiving rise by preference to spherical or oval cells. On a single cell\r\nwe often see two, three, four, five, six, and even more buds.\r\n\r\nWhen the buds of the oval or spherical cells detach themselves whilst\r\nyoung, they often resemble in form and size cells of ordinary yeast, nor\r\ncan even considerable experience in this kind of observation always\r\nenable us to distinguish them. Hence we may easily understand how many\r\nhave come to believe, with so skilful a botanist as Dr. Bail, in the\r\ntransformation of _mucor_ into yeast.\r\n\r\nWith the forms represented in Plates V. and VI., the plant is more of a\r\nferment than of a fungoid growth. In such cases the weight of sugar\r\ndecomposed in comparison with the weight of new cell-globules formed is\r\nvery considerable, an effect which is more marked the less air the plant\r\nhas at its disposal. Under the latter conditions, however, vegetation is\r\nslow and laborious, and the ferment very soon assumes an aspect of age,\r\nand we must constantly rejuvenate the cells by bringing them into\r\ncontact with oxygen, and subjecting them to the action of limited\r\nquantities of that gas, and so promote their vegetation and prolong\r\ntheir fermentative activity. This effect we brought about when we\r\nretransferred the liquid and its deposit of _mucor_ from the test-glass\r\nto the flask, thus bringing them into contact with fresh air. We saw\r\ncells that appeared old, dark, and highly granulated, become inflated,\r\ngrow more transparent, and fill with a gelatinous protoplasm, the few\r\ngranulations which they still exhibited assuming a brilliant appearance\r\nwhen we succeeded in distinguishing them; and finally, a very active\r\nbudding was set up. Under this reviving influence life could continue\r\nonce more away from the air, although with difficulty, so that\r\nfermentation would be most intense if the large filaments and their\r\nconidia were constantly being removed from and to the action of air.\r\n\r\nThe preceding plates show several instances of this rejuvenescence of\r\nthe old cells of _mucor_ ferment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 6. Ferment of Mucor.]\r\n\r\nWe have omitted to represent amongst the old cells some cells which have\r\ntheir granulations collected about the centre, with an empty space\r\nbetween the granulations and the exterior borders.[80] In this state,\r\ncells are generally dead and incapable of any revival. It is impossible\r\nto avoid being impressed by the striking analogies which exist between\r\nall these facts and those presented by cells of yeast.\r\n\r\nIn concluding our study of the vegetation of _mucor_ as a mould and\r\n_mucor_ as a ferment, we may again remark that the most striking\r\nanalogies also exist between the preceding observations and those we\r\nhave seen in the case of _penicillium_, _aspergillus_, and _mycoderma\r\nvini_. These latter plants do not furnish alcohol or carbonic acid gas\r\nby direct fermentation of the sugar, as long as we let them vegetate\r\nwith plenty of air at their disposal. Once submerged, however, their\r\nvital aspect changes; on the one hand the cells or filaments of the\r\nmycelia evince a tendency to become larger; on the other hand there is a\r\ntendency to greater closeness in these latter, and, consequently, a\r\ntransition to the state of _conidia_. Lastly, there is a correlative\r\nbudding of cells, accompanied by a formation of alcohol and liberation\r\nof carbonic acid gas; in short, all the ordinary signs of alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nThe principal difference in the case of _mucor_ consists in this, that\r\nthe vegetation of this latter, under the conditions of insufficient\r\naeration or none at all, is more decided, both as to extent and\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that all the varieties of _mucor_ are capable of\r\nyielding the kind of ferment that we have just mentioned. But this is\r\nnot the case; and here we have another striking proof of the great\r\nphysiological differences presented by forms of vegetation so intimately\r\nconnected with each other that, in botanical classifications, they must\r\nbe put as closely as possible together. Of this fact we have the most\r\nstriking example in _mycoderma vini_ and the alcoholic ferments,\r\nproperly so called, which so closely resemble each other in form and\r\ndevelopment that they might be supposed to be identical, at least,\r\naccording to our present knowledge, but which differ so widely in their\r\nphysiological aspects.\r\n\r\nOn November 17th, 1873, we found a very beautiful specimen of _mucor\r\nmucedo_ on a pear, under a glass bell jar. It was a mass of perfectly\r\nstraight filaments, simple and isolated, very large in comparison with\r\nthose ordinarily met with, each terminating in a sporange, identical to\r\nthat of _mucor mucedo_, and proportionately well developed. We are able\r\nto distinguish _mucor racemosus_ from _mucor mucedo_ only by the\r\ncircumstance of its having on its sporange-bearing hyphæ lateral\r\nbranches which also terminate in sporanges.\r\n\r\nWe sowed only one of the terminal heads of the large erect hyphae in\r\nsome wort, in which it soon produced an abundant mycelium, but without\r\nthe least appearance of gas. For a very long time, up to January 7th,\r\n1875, we studied the developments of this organism, which remained all\r\nthe time perfectly pure, in consequence of our having cultivated it in\r\none of our two-necked flasks on pure wort.\r\n\r\nThe total volume of liquid, which was 130 c.c., (4·57 fl. oz.) contained\r\n2·3 grammes (35·3 grains) of alcohol. In spite of this rather large\r\nproportion of alcohol, a clear sign of undoubted fermentation, the plant\r\nhad yielded no _conidia_ at all, nor any cell-globules of ferment. Some\r\nof the filaments, however, were larger than the rest, and exhibited\r\nirregularly-shaped swellings, which in some cases were of enormous size.\r\nWhilst the natural mycelial filaments, by which we mean the vegetating\r\npart of mucor, which were supplied with abundance of air, only measured\r\n3/450 of a millimetre[81] in diameter, the filaments that had grown\r\nprobably with an insufficiency of oxygen, and performed the functions of\r\nferment, measured 8/450, and the swellings as much as 30/450 of a\r\nmillimetre in diameter, as represented in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this paragraph, we may mention a very able research on\r\nfermentation which we have lately studied, the author of which, Dr.\r\nFitz, communicated it to the Chemical Society of Berlin in 1873. In\r\nsection II., page 48, this author explains his observations in a manner\r\nconformable to our own views, as may be seen from the following passage\r\nof the memoir:—\r\n\r\n“In the presence of oxygen, the ferment of _mucor_ develops into a\r\nmycelium and consumes the sugar; in the absence of oxygen, on the other\r\nhand, the spores develop into ferment of _mucor_, that buds and\r\ndecomposes the sugar into the products of fermentation.\r\n\r\n“The properties of _mucor mucedo_ in a fermentable liquid, in the\r\npresence or in the absence of oxygen, accord perfectly with the theory\r\nof fermentation established by Pasteur in 1861 (_Comptes rendus de\r\nl’Académie des Sciences_, t. lii., p. 1260). According to this theory a\r\nfermentative fungus needs oxygen for its development; if it finds any\r\nfree oxygen it utilizes the whole of it, assimilating one part of the\r\nsugar and burning the other; whilst in the absence of free oxygen, the\r\nfungus appropriates what it requires from the sugar.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  In the course of this work we shall combat, by means of experimental\r\n  proofs which appear to us irrefragable, the opinions which many\r\n  writers entertain on the subject of certain transformations of\r\n  organisms—that of _penicillium glaucum_ into ferment, or _mycoderma_;\r\n  of _bacteria_ into lactic ferment; of ferment into _vibrios_; of\r\n  _mycoderma aceti_ into ferment, and so on. Nevertheless, we shall\r\n  pronounce no _a priori_ opinion on the question whether the inferior\r\n  organisms, which will be the subject of this chapter, and which\r\n  include yeast and the ferments properly so called, are perfect beings\r\n  in their habitual form, or whether they are susceptible of\r\n  polymorphism. It is with this reservation that we employ the word\r\n  _autonomy_. If we claim polymorphism for any species, we shall not do\r\n  so without furnishing proofs. Some organs detached from higher\r\n  organisms, and some beings in a certain phase of their existence, may\r\n  reproduce themselves under a special form, with special properties,\r\n  when brought into media and under conditions that are unfit for the\r\n  production of the plant or animal under its other shape or ordinary\r\n  mode of reproduction. Modern Science affords many examples of this,\r\n  and certain alcoholic ferments present us with analogous facts; but to\r\n  wish to stretch these facts beyond their due significance, and to\r\n  admit a polymorphism that cannot be proved, in consequence of a belief\r\n  that it is possible, or on the faith of confused observations, is to\r\n  indulge in gratuitous assertion from a mere spirit of system.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  See, on this subject, the author’s _Études sur le Vinaigre_, Paris,\r\n  1868, p. 76, note; and especially _Études sur le Vin_, 2nd Edition,\r\n  1873, p. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Some observations in the preceding chapter enable us to account for\r\n  the vast number of germs which are constantly falling on the surface\r\n  of everything. We may here allude to the use we have made of flasks,\r\n  shaped as in Fig. 17, and holding from 250 c.c. to 300 c.c., which are\r\n  a third part filled with an organic liquid, and are closed up when\r\n  boiling. They contain no air when cool, and are opened in series of\r\n  10, 20, &c., out of doors, and closed up again immediately. The air\r\n  rushes violently into the vacuum, and thus we introduce about 200 c.c.\r\n  of air, with all the particles of dust contained in that air, into\r\n  each flask. It has been proved that a certain number of these flasks\r\n  undergo change in the course of time, the number of those changing and\r\n  the nature of their changes being in close proportion to the probable\r\n  number and nature of the floating germs able to develop in the\r\n  particular nutritive liquid used. If we work at great elevations, far\r\n  from houses and the dirt of towns and inhabited plains, as we did at\r\n  Montanvert, near the _Mer de Glace_, change will seldom occur. The\r\n  opposite will be the case if we work in a place like the living-room\r\n  of the little, dirty, ill-kept inn at Montanvert. In a laboratory\r\n  where fermentation is studied we obtain certain kinds of germs which\r\n  often differ from those found in the air of the open country. If we\r\n  desire to have organisms in all our flasks, we have only to stir up\r\n  the dust on the ground or on surrounding objects at the moment when we\r\n  open the flasks. This simple and easy experiment clearly shows us that\r\n  it is impossible for a field of sporanges of fungoid growth, existing\r\n  in an uncovered vessel or on the surface of a fruit, to escape\r\n  becoming mixed with germs that are foreign to the little plant; in\r\n  other words, the student who sows spores of _penicillium_, which he\r\n  has collected from one place or another on a brush, exposes himself to\r\n  serious causes of error.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  M. Jules Raulin has published a well-known and remarkable work on the\r\n  discovery of the mineral medium best adapted by its composition to the\r\n  life of certain ordinary fungoid growths; he has given a formula for\r\n  the composition of such a medium. It is this that we call here\r\n  “Raulin’s fluid” for abbreviation.\r\n\r\n                    Water                     1,500\r\n                    Sugar Candy                  70\r\n                    Tartaric Acid                 4\r\n                    Nitrate of Ammonia            4\r\n                    Phosphate of Ammonia        0·6\r\n                    Carbonate of Potassium      0·6\r\n                    Carbonate of Magnesia       0·4\r\n                    Sulphate of Ammonia        0·25\r\n                    Sulphate of Zinc           0·07\r\n                    Sulphate of Iron           0·07\r\n                    Silicate of Potassium      0·07\r\n\r\n  J. RAULIN.

A few\r\n  days after the sowing the growth of the fungus is arrested, in\r\n  consequence of all the oxygen being absorbed, and its place being\r\n  supplied by a mixture of carbonic acid and nitrogen; and the spores,\r\n  if kept too long in this atmosphere, will all perish.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  To shake the liquid without danger of introducing exterior particles\r\n  of dust, we apply the flame of the spirit lamp to the drawn-out neck\r\n  of the flask, and close up the open end; we may then shake our flask\r\n  without risk. We must afterwards reopen the end of the drawn-out neck\r\n  for the purpose of re-establishing communication with the exterior\r\n  air.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The flask B was closed with the lamp in consequence of one of the\r\n  objects of these experiments being to test M. Trécul’s experiments on\r\n  the transformation of _penicillium_ into ferment. Strangely enough,\r\n  according to M. Trécul, as we shall see later on, the spores of\r\n  _penicillium_ refuse to change into ferment, if the vessels in which\r\n  they are sown are not “perfectly air-tight.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  _Bulletin de la Société Philomathique._\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  HERMANN HOFFMANN, _Études Mycologiques sur la Fermentation_.\r\n  _Botanische Zeitung_ and _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, 4^e série,\r\n  t. xiii. p. 24, 1860.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  _Communication sur l’Origine et le Développement de quelques\r\n  Champignons._ Dantzig, 1867.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  TRÉCUL, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, t. lxxiii. p. 1454; December\r\n  28, 1871.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  TRÉCUL, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, t. lxxv. p. 1169, November 11,\r\n  1872. A proof of M. Trécul’s carelessness in experiments of this kind\r\n  is the fact that in studying the fertility of an impregnated wort, he\r\n  often obtains different productions. Our experiments give opposite\r\n  results. If we sow nothing, we obtain nothing. If we sow a plant, we\r\n  obtain a similar plant; or, should there be any difference, the change\r\n  may be traced, beyond question, to its origin in the plant sown, and\r\n  is the consequence of some alteration in the conditions of our\r\n  experiment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  _Comptes rendus des Séances de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. lxxv. p.\r\n  1220; Nov. 18, 1872.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above we have experienced some doubt as to whether\r\n  the forms of development represented in Fig. 20 are actually those of\r\n  the _aspergillus glaucus_, which we supposed our fungoid growth to be.\r\n  In some of the later sketches of our observations we find similar\r\n  forms, which belong to a bluish kind of _penicillium_, with rather\r\n  large spores. Fortunately, this doubt affects our argument in no\r\n  essential particular. It matters very little what variety of fungoid\r\n  growth it is that gives rise to alcoholic fermentation attended by\r\n  peculiarities of shape that only occur in the development of its\r\n  spores when air fails it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  By the term _conidia_ is meant certain chains of cells, which are in\r\n  reality mycelial spores.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  See PASTEUR, _Études sur le Vin_, 1st Edition, pp. 20 and following.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Since writing this paragraph, we have found in M.

(July-August,\r\n  1875), in which the learned microscopist says:—“The _torula cerevisiæ_\r\n  is derived from the _mycoderma cerevisiæ_. My observations leave no\r\n  doubt on my mind that _penicillium glaucum_ is one of the forms\r\n  evolved from spores or ferments that have preceded it, as M. Trécul\r\n  showed a long time ago, and that, moreover, the spores of\r\n  _penicillium_, germinating in suitable media, give us the sporical\r\n  form termed _mycoderma_.”\r\n\r\n  We take the liberty to observe that these assertions of M. Robin’s are\r\n  purely gratuitous. Up to the present time it has been impossible to\r\n  discover a suitable medium for the proof of these different\r\n  transformations or polymorphisms. From the time of Turpin, who firmly\r\n  believed that he had observed these changes, to our own, none of the\r\n  microscopists who have affirmed these transformations have succeeded\r\n  in adducing any convincing proof of them, and M. Trécul’s latest\r\n  observations, especially as regards _penicillium_ and its\r\n  transformation into ferment or into the _mycoderma_ of beer, have been\r\n  positively disproved by ours, supported, as they are, by proofs that\r\n  we consider irrefutable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  It is a very easy matter to study the liquids and growths in our\r\n  flasks during the course of a single experiment. We take out the glass\r\n  stopper that closes the india-rubber tube on the straight-neck, and,\r\n  by means of a long rod or a glass tube previously passed through the\r\n  flame, take up a quantity, which we draw out immediately for\r\n  microscopical examination. We then replace the glass stopper, taking\r\n  care to pass it through the flame before doing so, to burn up any\r\n  organic particles of dust that it may have picked up from the table on\r\n  which we laid it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  We may prove the occurrence of alcoholic fermentation by the cells of\r\n  submerged _mycoderma vini_ in a different manner. To do this, after\r\n  having made all our preparations as before and shaken up the film of\r\n  _mycoderma vini_ in its liquid, we must attach our flask to a test\r\n  flask (Fig. 19), and pass the turbid liquid into the latter. On\r\n  succeeding days we shall detect a very protracted fermentation in the\r\n  test flask; there will be a succession of minute bubbles rising from\r\n  the bottom, but in small number at a time. The fermentation is very\r\n  evident whilst it lasts, but is rather sluggish, and, although of very\r\n  long duration, ceases long before the sugar is exhausted.\r\n\r\n  This experiment proves better than any other the non-transformation of\r\n  _mycoderma vini_ into other ordinary fungoid growths. For after\r\n  decanting the liquid into the test flasks, the sides of the\r\n  experimental flask remain covered with streaks of _mycoderma vini_\r\n  along with some of the liquid. Moreover, the flask is refilled with\r\n  air, and this air is being constantly renewed, in part, by variations\r\n  of the temperature of the oven, so that the _mycoderma_ remaining on\r\n  the sides is thus placed under the most favourable conditions for\r\n  transformation into other fungoid growths, if that were possible. It\r\n  is still more easy to detach the experimental from the test flask, and\r\n  to pass pure air into it, once or twice a day, or constantly. In any\r\n  case, we shall never see anything besides the _mycoderma vini_ spring\r\n  up within it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  See PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus des Séances de l’Académie des Sciences_,\r\n  t. liv., 1862, and t. lv., 1862. _Études sur les Mycodermes, &c._\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  In a subsequent chapter we shall prove that yeast is likewise\r\n  incapable of transformation into _mycoderma vini_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  We secured the purity of our mycoderma by the same means that we have\r\n  already described for the procuring of spores of _penicillium_ or\r\n  other fungoid growths in a state of purity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  BUFFON, _Histoire de l’Homme_, t. viii., edition 12mo, 1778; TURPIN,\r\n  _Mémoires de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. xvii.; Dr. PINEAU, _Annales\r\n  des Sciences Naturelles_, t. iii., 1845; POUCHET, _Traité de la\r\n  Génération dite Spontanée_, p. 335, 1859.

This cellular tissue, which is very\r\n  abundant in the peach and all stone-fruit, in the apple and pear, in\r\n  the orange and grape, and similar fruits, is the same as that which\r\n  forms the body of a leaf. Being in every case composed of a simple\r\n  agglomeration of contiguous mother-vesicles, which are always filled\r\n  with globulines that are more or less developed, more or less\r\n  coloured, and individually endowed with a special vital centre, it is\r\n  not surprising that its globulines when free and detached from the\r\n  compound organisms to which they belong, and from association with its\r\n  vegetable life, should, when placed in a suitable medium, themselves\r\n  vegetate and become transformed, under these new influences, into a\r\n  mucedine, with filaments and articulations. Such are the very fine,\r\n  and, consequently, very transparent globulines, which, when left to\r\n  themselves in sweetened water, grow and become vesicular, producing\r\n  other globulines in their interior, then bud, vegetate into mucedinous\r\n  filaments, decompose sugar, and produce all the effects that\r\n  constitute what we term _alcoholic fermentation_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  BÉCHAMP, _Recherches sur la Nature et l’Origine des Ferments (Annales\r\n  de Chimie et de Physique, 4^e série_, t. xxiii., and _Comptes rendus\r\n  de l’Académie des Sciences_, Oct. 23, 1871).\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  We need scarcely here observe, having done so on previous occasions,\r\n  that whenever we opened our flasks to obtain specimens, we made use of\r\n  a fine tube, previously passed through the flame of a spirit lamp, and\r\n  that we also passed this flame over the surface of the india-rubber,\r\n  glass stopper, &c., to consume the organic particles of dust which\r\n  floating about might introduce themselves at the moment when we opened\r\n  the right-hand tube of the flask.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Ever since the year 1861 (see p. 92), this question of the possible\r\n  transformation of the ordinary fungi, especially _penicillium_ and\r\n  _mucor mucedo_, into yeast has engaged our attention. The results\r\n  attained have been entirely negative; but hitherto only the\r\n  conclusions of our work have been published, some account of which was\r\n  given at the meeting of the _Société Philomathique_ of March 30th,\r\n  1861. The following extract is from the _Bulletin_ of the\r\n  society:—“Meeting of March 30th, 1861. At this meeting a paper was\r\n  read by M. Pasteur ‘On the supposed changes in the form and vegetation\r\n  of yeast-cells, depending on the external condition of their\r\n  development.’ It is well-known that Leuwenhoeck was the first to\r\n  describe the globules of yeast, and that M. Cagnard-Latour discovered\r\n  their faculty of multiplying by budding. This interesting vegetable\r\n  organism has been the subject of a host of researches by chemists and\r\n  botanists. The latter, from the days of Turpin and Kutzing, have\r\n  almost unanimously regarded yeast as a form of development of various\r\n  inferior vegetable types, especially _penicillium_. The studies of\r\n  this subject which seem to have won most favour during the last few\r\n  years are those of MM. Wagner, Bail, Berkeley, and H. Hoffmann. The\r\n  researches of these botanists seem to strengthen and confirm the\r\n  original observations of Turpin and Kutzing. M. Pouchet has, quite\r\n  recently, expressed the same ideas, and has determined certain points\r\n  in connection with them with much precision of detail. M. Pasteur has\r\n  long studied this important question, which is so intimately connected\r\n  with the essential nature of yeast and with those phenomena of the\r\n  polymorphism of the inferior types of vegetable life, to which most of\r\n  the remarkable works of M. Tulasne relate; he has, however, arrived at\r\n  results that are altogether negative, and he declares that he was\r\n  unable to detect the transformation of yeast into any of the\r\n  _mucedines_ whatsoever, and, inversely, that he could never succeed in\r\n  producing the smallest quantity of yeast from ordinary _mucedines_.”\r\n  These same results we communicated to the _Société Chimique_ of Paris,\r\n  at a meeting held April 12th, 1861. Throughout the investigation of\r\n  which we have just indicated the conclusions, we insisted on the\r\n  necessity of cultivating the separate organisms in a state of purity\r\n  in all researches relating to these inferior forms of life, if we\r\n  desire to attain to sure inferences about them; and the method of\r\n  working, which we recommended, did not differ essentially from that\r\n  adopted in the present work. Since then the study of these growths has\r\n  been conducted with the utmost precautions; and other apparatus,\r\n  perhaps as safe as those which we employ and better adapted than ours\r\n  for the study of polymorphism of species, have been invented by\r\n  botanists of great skill—M. de Bary, in Germany, and M. Van Tieghem,\r\n  in France.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  We found, after the lapse of another year, in December, 1873, that the\r\n  ferment of the _mucor_ in the test glass might still be easily\r\n  revived; that it was able to propagate, both in the mycelium and in\r\n  the cellular form, in wort, and that it might produce a fermentation,\r\n  more or less active, according to the condition of aeration; in short,\r\n  that it was capable of producing all the characteristic phenomena\r\n  described. By means of the method of cultivation that we employ, our\r\n  study, which was continued for years, was pursued without the least\r\n  fear of any foreign fungoid growths being introduced into the vessels,\r\n  although they remained constantly open, and the air in them was being\r\n  perpetually renewed by the action of diffusion and variations of\r\n  temperature. In 1875 nothing remained alive in our flask, and further\r\n  revival became impossible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  We do not here take into account certain phenomena of oxidation of\r\n  which the fungoid growths are the seat, and which remind us of those\r\n  that are presented in so remarkable a degree by _mycoderma vini_ and\r\n  _mycoderma aceti_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  [There are 15·43 grains in the gramme.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  [For English equivalent see Experiment 1, p. 135.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  The figure given below supplies this omission. The cells that are\r\n  isolated or are in chains, _b.b.b._, show this state of the old cells.\r\n  The cells _a.a.a._ are younger, and may be more easily revived. We may\r\n  see by the dimensions of some of these how greatly, in certain cases,\r\n  the cells of _mucor_ resemble cells of yeast; nevertheless, in the\r\n  state of the contents and the aspect of the outlines, there are always\r\n  some differences sufficiently appreciable to strike the practised\r\n  observer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n  The figures adjoining the cells indicate fractions of a millimetre.

It\r\nis that one which, by reason of its active energy as an agent of\r\ndecomposition, has been distinguished and utilized from the earliest\r\ntimes, and is considered as the type of ferments in general; we mean the\r\nferment of wine, beer, and more generally, of all fermented beverages.\r\n\r\nYeast is that viscous sort of deposit which takes place in the vats or\r\nbarrels of must or wort that is undergoing fermentation. This kind of\r\nferment presents for consideration a physical fact of the most\r\nextraordinary character. Take a morsel of the substance and put it in\r\nsweetened water, in must, or in dough, which always contains a little\r\nsugar; after a time, the length of which varies, a few minutes often\r\nsufficing, we see these liquids or the dough rise, so to speak. This\r\ninflation of the mass, which is due to a liberation of carbonic acid\r\ngas, may cause it to overflow the vessels containing it, if their\r\ncapacity is not considerably greater than the volume of the matters\r\nfermenting. It is equally remarkable that these phenomena are natural\r\nand spontaneous; that is to say that the must, the wort, and the dough\r\nare able to rise, as we have termed it, when left to themselves, without\r\nthe least addition of foreign substances. The only difference that may\r\noccur in these phenomena is a certain amount of retardation, in cases\r\nwhere the yeast does not reach the saccharine matters in a perfectly\r\nnatural form, inasmuch as it then requires a certain time to get itself\r\ntogether before it can begin to act.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, indeed, that sugar should be present; for if we\r\nabstracted by some means or other from the must or dough all the sugar\r\ncontained in it, without touching the other constituents, the addition\r\nof yeast would produce no gas. Everything would remain quiet until the\r\nmoment when signs of a more or less advanced putrefaction showed\r\nthemselves. Yeast is one of the most putrescible of substances, and it\r\nis worthy of notice that its alteration is also the consequence of the\r\nformation of one or more ferments, very different, however, from that of\r\nwhich we are speaking. As for the nature of yeast, the microscope has\r\ntaught us what it is. That marvellous instrument, although still in its\r\ninfancy, enabled Leuwenhoeck, towards the close of the 17th century, to\r\ndiscover that yeast is composed of a mass of cells. In 1835\r\nCagnard-Latour and Schwann took up Leuwenhoeck’s observations, and by\r\nemploying a more perfect microscope, discovered that these same cells\r\nvegetate and multiply by a process of gemmation. Since then the physical\r\nand chemical phenomena already mentioned, such as the raising of the\r\nmass, the liberation of carbonic acid gas, and the formation of alcohol,\r\nhave been announced as acts probably connected with the living processes\r\nof a little cellular plant, and subsequent researches have confirmed\r\nthese views.\r\n\r\nIn introducing a quantity of yeast into a saccharine wort, it must be\r\nborne in mind that we are sowing a multitude of minute living cells,\r\nrepresenting so many centres of life, capable of vegetating with\r\nextraordinary rapidity in a medium adapted to their nutrition. This\r\nphenomenon can occur at any temperature between zero and 55° C. (131°\r\nF.), although a temperature between 15° C. and 30° C. (59° F. and 86°\r\nF.) is the most favourable to its occurrence.\r\n\r\nAs regards the rapidity of the budding, the following observations will\r\ngive some idea of what it is in the case of one of the ferments of\r\nnatural must. The temperature was between 12° C. and 13° C. (55° F.).\r\n\r\n“On October 12, 1861, at ten o’clock in the morning, we crushed some\r\ngrapes, without filtering the juice that ran from them; afterwards, at\r\ndifferent times during the day, we examined the juice under the\r\nmicroscope, until at last, although not before seven o’clock in the\r\nevening, we detected a couple of cells, as represented in Fig. 25, _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nFrom that time we kept these contiguous cells constantly in view. At\r\n7.10 we saw them separate and remove to some little distance from each\r\nother (Fig. 25, _b_). Between 7 and 7.30 we saw, on each of these cells,\r\na very minute bud originate and grow little by little. These buds\r\ndeveloped very near the point of contact, where the disjunction had just\r\ntaken place. By 7.45 the buds had increased greatly in size (Fig. 25,\r\n_c_). By 8 they had attained the size of the mother-cells. By 9 each\r\ncell of each couple had put forth a new bud (Fig. 25, _d_). We did not\r\nfollow the multiplication of the cells any farther, having seen that in\r\nthe course of two hours two cellules had furnished eight, including the\r\ntwo mother-cells.”[82]\r\n\r\nAn increase like this, which would have been more rapid at a temperature\r\nbetween 15° and 25° (59° and 77° F.), and still more so between 25° and\r\n30° (77° and 86° F.), may indeed seem surprising. It is really, however,\r\nnothing to what sometimes occurs. In choosing proper conditions of\r\ntemperature and medium, of state and nature of yeast, it has sometimes\r\nhappened that the bottom of a vessel has become covered with a white\r\ndeposit of yeast cells, in the course of not more than five or six hours\r\nafter we had sown a quantity of yeast so small as to effect no change at\r\nall in the transparency of the liquid contained in the vessel after it\r\nhad been shaken up. Such a rapidity of vegetation reminded us of those\r\nexotic plants which are said to grow several feet in height in the\r\ncourse of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nBudding commences in the form of a simple protuberance on the cell—a\r\nkind of little boss, as represented in Fig. 26, No. 1. This protuberance\r\ngoes on increasing, and assumes a spherical or oval form. At the same\r\ntime, there is a tendency in the points of attachment in the young cell\r\nto meet—a kind of strangulation occurs (Fig. 26, No. 2). The junction\r\ntakes place a little sooner or later, according to the species (Fig. 26,\r\nNo. 3); the two individuals then separate (Fig. 26, No. 4). In certain\r\ncases a single cell may give rise to several protuberances, and,\r\nconsequently, to several daughter-cells. Where there is only one\r\nprotuberance or bud we generally see it originate at the thick end and a\r\nlittle on one side of the apex of the oval outline, which, in a greater\r\nor less degree, characterizes the cells of the majority of ferments.\r\n\r\nCertain authors have maintained that the method of budding which we have\r\njust described, and which we think was first promulgated by\r\nMitscherlich, is merely an illusion, and that the cells of yeast break\r\nup and scatter their granular contents, and that these scattered\r\ngranules eventually attach themselves to the cells, growing there, and\r\nso giving the appearance of buds or daughter-cells. This error has been\r\nrevived quite recently.[83] Nothing can be less admissible. We could\r\ncount the number of yeast cells which we have seen undergo this process\r\nof rupture in the course of some ten years of observation, every day of\r\nwhich, we may say, thousands of these cells have passed under our eyes.\r\nThis breaking up of the cells is really of the most rare occurrence, and\r\nmay always be explained by some abnormal circumstance affecting the\r\nyeast; being indeed a mechanical accident, not a physiological fact. We\r\nmay easily convince ourselves of this by growing some yeast in a\r\nsaccharine wort, filtered perfectly clear, and, consequently, deprived\r\nof all granular amorphous deposit that might deceive the observer. The\r\ncells will be observed to bud and multiply without exhibiting the most\r\nminute appearance of granulation, or disruption; moreover, there will\r\nalways be cells of all sizes, ranging from the smallest visible up to\r\nthe largest. This very simple piece of observation may be made in all\r\nthe alcoholic ferments, and with any wort capable of fermenting, and in\r\nits presence the hypothesis, which we have been repudiating, cannot hold\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nIn Plate VII. (left side) there is represented a field of yeast,\r\nmagnified 400 times. We see a mass of disjointed cells, such as appear\r\nafter fermentations without sufficient aliment; of the kind represented\r\nsome are nearly spherical, others oval or cylindrical, more or less\r\nelongated. If we mix a little of this yeast, of about the size of a\r\npin’s head, with wort, and put the wort into a small, shallow,\r\nflat-bottomed basin, having a surface of about 1 square decimetre (10\r\nsq. ins.) exposing it to the surrounding temperature, we shall find next\r\nday the bottom of the basin covered with a fine white deposit, of the\r\nforms of which we give a sketch in the right half of the plate. In this\r\nit will at once be observed that the cells sown have lost their interior\r\ngranulations, having become more transparent and filled with a\r\ngelatinous protoplasm. The principal difference between the two halves\r\nof the plate consists in this, that whereas the cells in the left half\r\nare isolated and granular, those in the right half are more inflated,\r\nmore transparent, and provided with buds, which may be seen in every\r\nstage of development, from their first appearance till they become as\r\nlarge as the parent cells. They continue to grow until they detach\r\nthemselves; then they bud in their turn, so that the same figure may\r\nfurnish examples of cells of the first, second, and third generations.\r\nIn the right half, the protoplasm contained in the cells exhibits\r\ncircular spots or vacuoles, which may be made to appear lighter or\r\ndarker than the rest of the cell by slight movements of the object-glass\r\nof the microscope. These spots are due to a migration of the protoplasm\r\ntowards the sides; they commonly occur in yeast cells the vitality of\r\nwhich, from deficient nourishment, has become suppressed—the shrivelled\r\nappearance which they then assume being due to their being forced to\r\nlive upon themselves, so to speak. However, by introducing such cells\r\ninto a nutritive and aerated liquid the vacuoles quickly disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 7. Yeast-cells—Worn out and Dissociated (left),\r\nafter Revival in a Sweet Wort (right).]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary yeast, as met with in breweries, the majority of cells\r\nshow one or more of these vacuoles; if, however, we place a little of\r\nthis yeast in an aerated wort, and watch under the microscope the\r\nchanges that occur in the cells, we shall witness, often in the course\r\nof a few seconds, a kind of turgescence, a greater tension of the\r\ncell-walls, which seem to grow thinner, and a complete disappearance of\r\nthe vacuoles. At the same time the interior gelatinous matter will\r\nbecome filled with fine granulations that are scarcely visible, but\r\nwhich at a certain distance appear brilliant. At the same time\r\nprotuberances begin to show themselves, and next day the budding will\r\nhave already become very active. The newly-formed cells will have such a\r\ndelicacy of aspect and contour as to be scarcely discernible in the\r\nfield of the microscope. There will also be a tendency to ramification\r\nin the budding, which appearance will be more or less marked according\r\nto the kind of alcoholic ferments present, as we shall see presently,\r\nattaining its maximum in each case when the cells have been revived\r\nafter exhaustion by rest and want of food. In the latter case, the\r\nprocess of rejuvenescence may be protracted; but this is not the case\r\nwith cells of commercial yeast, which is always used within a few days\r\nof its formation. And thus, as I said a little ago, speaking of these\r\ncells, they often manifest the first signs of their budding in a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nIn our preceding remarks we have expressly assumed that there are many\r\nkinds of alcoholic ferment. This is, beyond doubt, the case, as we have\r\ngiven incontestable proofs, first in 1862, in the _Bulletin de la\r\nSociété chimique_ of Paris, and later on, in 1864 and 1866, in a Note in\r\nthe _Comptes rendus_, on the diseases of wines, as well as in our\r\n“Studies on Wine.” Moreover, we know that brewers have long recognized\r\ntwo distinct methods of fermentation—“high” fermentation and “low”\r\nfermentation—and two corresponding yeasts. It is true that the\r\ndifferences presented by these fermentations were believed to be caused\r\nby the different conditions under which they took place, and that it was\r\nsupposed that we might change “high” yeast into “low” yeast, or\r\ninversely, by subjecting the first to a low temperature, or the second\r\nto a high one. In our observations of 1862, which we have just\r\nmentioned, we discovered that must gives rise to several yeasts; that\r\nthe ferment of “high” beer cannot develop except with great difficulty\r\nin must, whilst one of the ferments of the grape grows rapidly and\r\nluxuriantly in wort; that it is easy to isolate the smallest of the\r\nferments of the grape from its congeners, by subjecting filtered must to\r\nfermentation; and finally, that the secondary fermentations of wines\r\nwhich remain sweet furnish a remarkable ferment, very different in\r\naspect to the ferment of beer.\r\n\r\nWe have not given specific names to these different ferments, any more\r\nthan we have to the other microscopic organisms which we have had\r\noccasion to study. This was not from any disregard for names, but from a\r\nconstant fear that, since the physiological functions of these minute\r\nforms was the exclusive object of our study, we might be led to attach\r\ntoo much importance to exterior characters. We have often found that\r\nforms, having nothing apparently in common, belong to one and the same\r\nspecies, whilst similarity of form may associate species far apart. We\r\nshall give some fresh examples of this fact in the present paragraph. A\r\nGerman naturalist, Dr. Rees, who has discovered new proofs of the\r\ndiversity of alcoholic ferments, putting aside, perhaps rightly, such\r\nscruples, has attached specific names to the different kinds of\r\nferments, in his _brochure_ published in 1870, which we have already\r\ncited (p. 71). Indeed, we have often ourselves, for brevity’s sake, made\r\nuse of the names proposed by Dr. Rees.[84]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nIn a Note inserted in the _Bulletin de la Société chimique de Paris_, in\r\n1862, we figured a ferment of small dimensions, which develops\r\nspontaneously in must, filtered or unfiltered, and which is very\r\ndifferent from the ordinary ferment of wine. It is the first to make its\r\nappearance in the fermentation of the grape, and may even appear alone\r\nif the must has been previously well filtered, doubtless because its\r\ngerms, being smaller than those of other ferments, pass through the\r\nfilter more easily and in greater number. Fig. 27, extracted from our\r\nNote of 1862, represents this ferment, together with some spherical\r\ncells of _high_ yeast, with the object of giving a more exact idea of\r\nthe relative dimensions of these two ferments and their dissimilarities.\r\nDr. Rees has named it _saccharomyces apiculatus_.\r\n\r\nThe same savant has given the name of _saccharomyces pastorianus_ to the\r\nyeast of the secondary fermentations of sweet liquids, such as wine that\r\nhas remained sweet after its principal fermentation. We have described\r\nthis yeast in a Note published in 1864, on the diseases of wine, from\r\nwhich we give the following extract:—[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\n“Fig. 6 (Fig. 28 in this work) represents a very interesting variety of\r\nalcoholic ferment. It happens pretty often, especially in the Jura,\r\nwhere the vintage takes place about October 15th, when the season is\r\nalready cold and little favourable to fermentation, that the wine is\r\nstill sweet at the moment when it is put into casks. This is especially\r\nthe case in good years, when the sugar is abundant and the proportion of\r\nalcohol high, a circumstance which prevents the completion of\r\nfermentation when effected at a low temperature. The wine remains sweet\r\nin cask sometimes for several years, undergoing a continuous but feeble\r\nalcoholic fermentation. In such wines we have always observed the\r\npresence of this peculiar ferment. In form it consists of a principal\r\nstem, forming nodes at various points, from which short branches arise,\r\nending in spherical or ovoid cells. These cells readily detach\r\nthemselves, and act as spores of the plant. It is rarely, however, that\r\nwe see so perfect a vegetation as we have represented, because the\r\ndifferent parts fall to pieces, as we have shown in the left half of the\r\nfigure.”\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin of cellular plants of this remarkable type? Where and\r\nhow are the ferments of the grape generated?\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III. § 3 we were on our way to a solution of this question.\r\nIt has been shown that fermentation cannot take place in the juice of\r\ncrushed grapes if the must has not come into contact and been mixed with\r\nparticles of dust on the surface of the grapes, or of the woody part of\r\nthe bunch. It would, however, be sufficient that a vintage vat, of any\r\ncapacity whatsoever, should receive the particles of dust existing on a\r\nsingle bunch in some cases, on even a single grape, for the whole mass\r\nto enter into fermentation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 8. Fertile Mould-cells from the Outer Surface of\r\nGrapes.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, we must ask ourselves, is the nature of these particles of\r\ndust? On September 27th, 1872, we picked from a vine, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Arbois, a bunch of grapes, of the variety called _le\r\nnoirin_. The bunch selected, without any injury to a single grape, was\r\nbrought to our laboratory in a sheet of paper that had been previously\r\nscorched in the flame of a spirit lamp, and the grapes were cut off with\r\na pair of fine scissors, which had also been passed through the flame.\r\nBy means of a badger-hair brush, thoroughly purified in water, each\r\ngrape to which a portion of its peduncle remained attached, was washed\r\nin a little pure water. The successive washing of a dozen grapes in 3\r\nc.c. of water was sufficient to make the water turbid; we then examined\r\nit under the microscope. Each field contained many little organized\r\nbodies, accidentally associated, now and again, with some very scarce\r\ncrystalline spicules. As a rule, the organisms consisted of simple,\r\ntransparent, colourless cells; some, indeed, of larger size had a\r\nyellowish brown colour, and were detached or united in irregular masses;\r\nand, lastly, there were club-shaped or bottle-shaped vessels, full of\r\nspores ready to germinate. We repeated this experiment with bunches of\r\nother varieties of grape, and also submitted to examination water in\r\nwhich the outer surfaces of gooseberries, plums, and pears had been\r\nwashed; the result was in each case the same, that is, we found a great\r\nnumber of the same colourless cells, and the same irregular masses of\r\ndarker cells, which latter, however, we must not confound with the\r\nmasses of dead cells sometimes found covering parts of the epidermis of\r\ncertain fruits.\r\n\r\nAs we had purposely left each fruit attached to part of its peduncle, we\r\nwished to ascertain if these corpuscles proceeded from the grapes or\r\nfrom the wood of the peduncle. For this purpose we washed separately the\r\nsurface of the grapes and the woody part of the bunch. The water in\r\nwhich the latter was washed was visibly more charged with the minute\r\norganisms than that in which the grapes was washed, although the latter\r\nwas by no means free from them.\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. represents these corpuscles as they exist on the surface of\r\nfruits, magnified 500 times. The groups, _b_, _b_, _b_, ..., _c_, _c_,\r\n... are of a brown colour, more or less dark, or of a reddish yellow;\r\nthe cells _a_, _a_, ... are transparent. Amongst them are some spores of\r\nordinary fungoid growths, and several cells which are probably the issue\r\nof a germination that had commenced in certain groups which have a hard,\r\nyellowish appearance, and which are provided with what seems to be a\r\ndouble case—_b_, _b_, _b_, ..., _c_, _c_, ..., a result of the moisture\r\nof the woody part of the bunch, or of rain that fell just before the\r\ncommencement of our observations.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy matter to trace the germination of these different\r\nvarieties of cells with the microscope. We put a drop of the water in\r\nwhich the woody part of a bunch of grapes has been washed into a small\r\nquantity of wort, previously boiled and filtered bright. Plate IX.\r\npresents a series of developments observed in the case of simple or\r\ngrouped cells, A, D, G, and J. The process is as follows: The\r\nyellowish-brown cells soften and grow larger in the nutritive medium,\r\nand gradually become almost transparent and colourless. At the same time\r\nwe see some very young buds appear on their margins; these rapidly\r\nincrease in size, and detaching themselves to make room for others, move\r\noff as young cells that after a time bud in their turn. The rapidity\r\nwith which these cells bud and multiply is often extraordinary. The\r\ngroup A and the cell D produced the groups C and F within twenty-four\r\nhours, passing through the intermediate stages represented in groups B,\r\nE. The cells A and D did not give rise to any filamentous growths, at\r\nleast whilst under our observation. Some groups of cells, however, put\r\nforth, from the first, long filaments, having cross-partitions and\r\nresembling the mycelium in ordinary fungoid growths. Together with\r\nthese, and along their whole length, was an abundance of cells, often in\r\nclusters, as represented by Fig. G, the whole of which growth took place\r\nin less than twenty-four hours.[86] But apart from contact with the air,\r\nthere was a complete absence of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 9. Various Examples of the Mode of Growth of\r\nMould-cells from the Outer Surface of Grapes.]\r\n\r\nThe figures H, I, J, K, represent other aspects of developing cells and\r\nfilaments. The cells H are spherical; the cells I have numerous buds, as\r\nalso have those marked K. These different forms were all produced in the\r\ncourse of twenty-four hours by the cell which may be observed in the\r\ncentre of the group J. In connection with this same group, J, we may\r\nremark that on September 30, 1872, at 10 A.M., we witnessed the\r\ndetachment of three oval cells at the points _a_, _b_, _c_; by 10.45\r\nother buds of the size represented in our engraving had formed in their\r\nplace; by about five o’clock that same afternoon these buds, _a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, having become transformed into cells, fell off in their turn.[87]\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, what proof have we that amongst the filamentous and\r\ncellular growths which spring from the small, dark bodies existing in\r\nthe particles of dust adhering to the surface of fruits, and which we\r\nhere see bud and multiply with such marvellous rapidity, the ferment or\r\nferments of vintage do actually exist? A very simple experiment will\r\nprove conclusively that this is the case. When in the course of\r\ntwenty-four or forty-eight hours, by contact with saccharine must, and\r\nin presence of excess of air, the revival and development of the cells\r\nhas taken place on the bottom of the little troughs employed in our\r\nobservations; if then we fill up the trough with the same must, so that\r\nthere remains no free air under the cover-glass, within a very short\r\ntime—an hour, half-an-hour, or often less—we shall see bubbles of gas\r\nrise from the bottom, accompanied by an increase in the deposit of\r\ncells. This will be the must fermenting after the submersion of the\r\ncellular plants. It follows that the cells, or groups of cells, of a\r\ndark colour which cover the grapes, or the woody part of the clusters,\r\nare actual germs of the cells of yeast; more correctly speaking, that\r\ngerms of yeast-cells exist amongst these groups, for it would not be\r\nconsistent with truth to say that the various germinating forms present\r\nin the dust on the surface of grapes must all of them give rise to\r\nactual corresponding ferments. Thus the flask-shaped spores _c_, _c_,\r\n... in Plate VIII., are reproductive organs of _alternaria tenuis_,\r\nwhich have probably nothing in common with alcoholic ferment or\r\nferments, properly so called, except their outward form. We may repeat,\r\nhowever, and it is a point of great importance to bear in mind, that the\r\ncells of yeast originate from some or other of the little, brownish,\r\norganized bodies, which the microscope reveals in such numbers amongst\r\nthe particles of dust existing on the surface of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility, which we have already demonstrated (Chapter III. §\r\n3), of making grape juice ferment apart from the action of external\r\nparticles of dust, and the knowledge which we have just acquired, that\r\nthe particles of dust on the surface of the grapes and woody peduncles,\r\nat the moment when the grapes have attained maturity, contain certain\r\nreproductive cells which give rise to certain ferments, naturally lead\r\nus to the investigation of another point, which concerns the period at\r\nwhich these germs make their appearance on the different parts of the\r\nvine plant. The two following experiments tend to prove that the ferment\r\ncan only appear about the time when the grapes attain maturity, and that\r\nit disappears during the winter, not to reappear before the end of the\r\nfollowing summer.\r\n\r\nI. In the month of October, 1873, we procured from a vineyard in the\r\ncanton of Arbois some of the woody parts of very ripe clusters of\r\ngrapes, taking the precaution to cut off all the grapes, one by one,\r\nwith a very clean pair of scissors, whilst still on the vine; we then\r\nwrapped up the woody parts of the clusters, thus deprived of their\r\ngrapes, in thin paper, to convey them to Paris. Our only object at that\r\ntime was to secure for use in our subsequent studies the ferment-bearing\r\ndust found in October on the woody part of the vine, and, more\r\nparticularly, on the clusters themselves, as already stated. After our\r\nreturn to Paris, and during the course of our experiments in October and\r\nNovember, it sufficed to wash a few scraps of the bunches in a little\r\npure water, in order to obtain the grape-ferment in abundance; but later\r\non in the winter we were astonished to find that the same procedure\r\nyielded no ferment, only some moulds. The bunches which, when put into\r\nboiled and filtered must, in October, very readily caused that must to\r\nferment, at the end of winter could no longer produce the same effect,\r\nhowever favourable might be the temperature to which we raised the must.\r\nThe particles of dust on the bunches had, therefore, become sterile, as\r\nsources of alcoholic ferments.\r\n\r\nII. On February 17th, 1875, we purchased of Chevet, a dealer in\r\nprovisions, two bunches of white grapes, which were perfectly sound,\r\npresenting not the slightest trace of injury or bruise. We took an iron\r\npot full of mercury, which had been heated to 200° C. (392° F.), and\r\nthen covered over its surface with a sheet of paper that had also been\r\nsubjected to flame. When the mercury had cooled down we placed several\r\nof Chevet’s grapes, singly and in small bunches, on the surface of the\r\nmetal, and, after having enclosed them in a glass cylinder that had been\r\npreviously heated with and by means of the mercury, we crushed them in\r\nthis vessel, in contact with air, by means of a strong, crooked iron\r\nwire that had been passed through the flame of a spirit lamp. The object\r\nof all these precautions was to prevent any cause of error, such as\r\nmight have resulted from the accession of particles of dust associated\r\nwith the mercury, or floating about our laboratory. We then placed our\r\ncylindrical jar in an oven, at a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.); but\r\nthough the experiment was continued for several days following, no\r\nfermentation manifested itself. At last, to assure ourselves that the\r\npulp and liquid were, notwithstanding this, well adapted to\r\nfermentation, we introduced into the test-flask an almost imperceptible\r\nquantity of yeast. This readily developed, and promptly produced\r\nfermentation.[91]\r\n\r\nIt seems possible, therefore, that the germs of ferment may not exist on\r\nbunches of sound grapes during winter, and that the well-known\r\nexperiment of Gay-Lussac on the influence of air on the fermentation of\r\nthe must of crushed grapes cannot succeed at all times.\r\n\r\nThe following observations will afford more than sufficient proof of\r\nthis statement, being, after all, but an easy method of carrying out\r\nGay-Lussac’s experiment, without having recourse to the use of mercury.\r\n\r\nIt may already be inferred from the preceding facts that there must be,\r\nin the course of the year, between the end of winter and autumn, a\r\nperiod when the vegetation of the cellules from which yeast proceeds\r\nundergoes a revival. When does this period occur? In other words, how\r\nlong after winter does sterility of the plant continue, until it is\r\nagain capable of yielding ferment? To ascertain this, we conducted\r\nnumerous experiments during the summer and autumn of 1875 and the winter\r\nof 1876. Having to conduct them in a vine-growing country—in the\r\nvineyards of Arbois, Franche-Comté—at a distance from our laboratory, we\r\nwere compelled to adopt a simple form of apparatus for our experiments,\r\nwhich, besides being very convenient, was at the same time sufficiently\r\nexact for the object we had in view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nInto common test-tubes we poured some preserved must; we then boiled it,\r\nwith the object of destroying all the germs that it might contain, and\r\nthen, having passed the flame of a spirit lamp over the upper sides of\r\nthe tubes, we closed them with corks which had been held in the flame\r\nuntil they began to carbonize (Fig. 32). Having provided ourselves with\r\na series of tubes prepared in this manner, we carried them to a vine,\r\nand there dropped into some of them grapes, into others bunches, from\r\nwhich we had taken all the grapes, by cutting their peduncles; into\r\nothers, fragments of leaves or the wood of the branches. The corks were\r\nagain passed through the flame and replaced successively in each tube.\r\nSome of the grapes we dropped in whole, some we crushed at the bottom of\r\nthe tubes with an iron rod that had previously been passed through the\r\nflame; others, again, at the same moment that we introduced them into\r\nthe tubes, were cut open with scissors, likewise passed previously\r\nthrough the flame, so that a portion of their interior juice might mix\r\nwith the must in the tube.\r\n\r\nOur experiments gave the following results:—As long as the grapes were\r\ngreen, about the end of July and during the first fortnight of August,\r\nwe obtained no fermentation in our must. Between the 20th and 25th of\r\nAugust a few tubes underwent fermentation, by the action of the little\r\napiculated ferment; and in the course of September the number of tubes\r\nthat fermented increased progressively. In each series of tubes,\r\nhowever, we always found a few in which there was a complete absence of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nHere are a few actual examples. In the beginning of September we placed\r\ngrapes in thirteen tubes, into some whole, into others crushed ones,\r\ntaken from bunches of the variety known as the _ploussard_, the fruit\r\nbeing already sufficiently ripe to be very pleasant to the taste. All\r\nthe tubes of this series failing to give us any trace of fermentation,\r\nor anything besides ordinary moulds—which indeed appeared in all our\r\nexperiments, whether there was or was not fermentation—we began a new\r\nseries of experiments, under similar conditions, on September 28th, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nNos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 tubes containing one uncrushed grape.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 tube containing two uncrushed grapes.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 tube containing two crushed grapes.\r\n\r\nNo. 7 tube containing two crushed grapes, in 2 c.c. of water previously\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\nNo. 8 tube with a fragment of a bunch from which grapes had been cut,\r\nand occupying the entire depth of liquid.\r\n\r\nNo. 9 tube with a fragment of wood from a branch.\r\n\r\nNos. 10, 11, and 12 tubes with a fragment of leaf.\r\n\r\nOn September 29th and 30th there was no appearance of fermentation in\r\nany of the flasks, but all contained flakes of fungoid mycelium. On the\r\n1st of October fermentation more or less marked and active occurred in\r\n2, 3, 4, and 5, in which uncrushed grapes were, accompanied by a general\r\nturbidity of the liquid, and a suspension of the development of the\r\nfungoid growths. It was still absent in 1, 6, and 7, of which the first\r\ncontained an entire, the latter crushed grapes. No. 8, containing the\r\nwoody part of the bunch, was in active fermentation. Nos. 9, 10, 11, and\r\n12, with fragments of branch or leaves, showed no signs of fermentation.\r\nThe following day No. 1 was fermenting; but from October 5th onwards\r\nthere was no alteration in the number of fermenting tubes.\r\n\r\nIn this series we determined the presence of the small apiculated form\r\nof yeast (_S. apiculatus_) in the tubes that fermented, only once\r\nfinding it associated with _saccharomyces pastorianus_.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly say that the grapes which we employed were perfectly\r\nripe, the vintage having already commenced in some of the Jura cantons.\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that, even when the grapes are perfectly matured,\r\nit by no means follows that each individual grape must carry germs of\r\nferment, and that some grapes may be crushed, in some instances several\r\ntogether may be crushed, without being able to set up a fermentation. In\r\nthe presence of these novel facts, those who support the hypothesis of\r\nthe transformation of the albuminous matter contained in the juice of\r\ngrapes into yeast will no doubt admit the untenability of their\r\nopinions, since their hypothesis requires that every grape or number of\r\ngrapes, when crushed, should ferment, in contact with air.\r\n\r\nOn the same day we prepared another series of tubes, using grapes of a\r\nvariety called the _trousseau_.\r\n\r\nNos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 tubes containing one whole grape.\r\n\r\nNos. 5 and 6 tubes containing some of the wood of a branch.\r\n\r\nNo. 7 tube containing some of the wood of a branch from which the grapes\r\nhad been detached.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following days fermentation took place in 4, 5, and\r\n7.\r\n\r\nIn this case three out of four of the uncrushed grapes did not cause the\r\nmust in which they were placed to ferment; whilst the same must\r\nfermented in one of the two tubes containing wood of the branch, and in\r\nthe other remained unchanged; and, lastly, the tube containing the woody\r\npeduncles of the bunch fermented.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that it was more particularly the wood of the\r\nbunch that was charged with germs of ferment. The truth of this\r\nassertion was proved by the following series of experiments.\r\n\r\nOn October 2nd, 1875, we charged at the vineyard twenty-four tubes, all\r\nof which were about a third filled with pure must that had been\r\npreviously boiled.\r\n\r\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 tubes containing one crushed grape.\r\n\r\nNo. 7 tube containing two crushed grapes.\r\n\r\nNo. 8 tube containing one crushed grape.\r\n\r\nNos. 9, 10, 11, and 12 tubes containing some wood of a branch of the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nNos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 tubes containing\r\na fragment of the wood of a bunch from which the grapes had all been\r\ndetached and removed.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following days some of these tubes began to\r\nferment; but in others only fungoid mycelia were visible.\r\n\r\nOn October 7th the following tubes were fermenting: the second of the\r\nfirst eight containing whole or crushed grapes; not one of the four that\r\ncontained wood of the branches; whilst, on the other hand, of the tubes\r\ncontaining wood of the bunches, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 were all\r\nin full fermentation. In short, fermentation, and therefore germs of\r\nyeast, were present in one single tube out of eight containing grapes;\r\nin none of the four tubes containing wood of the vine branch; but in\r\nseven out of the dozen containing wood of the bunches. There was no\r\nsubsequent change in the number of tubes that fermented.\r\n\r\nThe same day that we arranged this series of tubes we prepared\r\ntwenty-four other similar ones, using the _wood of bunches preserved\r\nfrom the vintage of the preceding year_. Not one of these twenty-four\r\ntubes showed the least sign of fermentation, although they contained\r\ngrape juice in presence of the wood of the bunches; this was a further\r\nconfirmation of the sterility of the germs of ferment in the case of\r\nbunches of grapes preserved for a sufficient time.\r\n\r\nThe next question to be considered was, what length of time after the\r\nvintage do the germs on the surface of the woody part of bunches of\r\ngrapes preserve the faculty of producing yeast? The following\r\nexperiments were undertaken to determine this point.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that on October 2 fragments of the woody peduncles\r\nintroduced with must, on the spot, caused that must to ferment in seven\r\ncases out of twelve. In order that we might test the wood of these same\r\nbunches during winter we took care to wrap some fragments up in paper\r\npreviously passed through the flame. We afterwards took occasion to test\r\nportions of these fragments as follows:—\r\n\r\nOn December 21st, 1875, we conducted an experiment with twelve. On the\r\nfollowing days all began to show flakes of mycelium, or numerous\r\nmultiplying cells of _mycoderms_, _torulæ_, and _dematium_; and only\r\nfour subsequently produced yeast and alcoholic fermentation. From this\r\nwe may conclude that, three months after the vintage, a large number of\r\nthe germs of yeast spread over the woody part of the bunches lose their\r\nvitality, through desiccation by the surrounding air, since two-thirds\r\nof the examples taken had become sterile by that time.\r\n\r\nOn January 21st we conducted a similar experiment with twelve other\r\ntubes. At a temperature between 20° and 25° C. (68° to 77° F.)\r\nfermentation occurred in only two of them. On March 2nd we undertook\r\nanother experiment, again using twelve tubes, and again fermentation\r\noccurred in two tubes.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of April the sterility was absolute. At that period of\r\nthe year (April and May) we made numerous experiments of this kind,\r\nusing the woody parts of fresh bunches of grapes and white grapes\r\npreserved from the last vintage, plenty of which were still to be had in\r\na state of freshness at the provision store. We also operated on some\r\nwood obtained from a vineyard at Meudon. In a great number of cases no\r\nfermentation occurred; it even happened that a whole bunch of fresh\r\nblack grapes, very ripe, which were bought at Chevet’s on April 16th,\r\nand which had been grown in a hot-house, after having been crushed, did\r\nnot ferment at all.\r\n\r\nUp to March not one of the tubes containing the wood of dry bunches\r\nbrought from the Jura, which had fermented, showed any signs of\r\n_apiculatus_ or of _pastorianus_, or anything besides the ordinary low\r\nyeast of wine, _saccharomyces ellipsoideus_.[93]\r\n\r\nIt would be a study of much interest to determine if yeast exists on\r\nother species of plants besides the vine. During the winter we could\r\ndiscover it on no others. Once during the winter, experimenting on box,\r\nwe obtained fermentation in one of our tubes which contained must. In a\r\ngreat number of other experiments we obtained nothing besides moulds and\r\ngrowths of _dematium_, _alternaria_, and _torulaceæ_.\r\n\r\nOur observations in Chap. III § 6, taken in connection with those which\r\nwe have just made, prove that the yeasts of fermentation, after being\r\ndried, preserve the faculty of germination longer than the germ-cells\r\nwhich are scattered over the dead wood of the vine.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, a microscopical examination of the particles of\r\ndust scattered over the surface of the fruit and woody peduncles of\r\ngrapes, reveals great differences in the number of these fertile\r\nparticles at different periods of the vegetation of the grapes. As long\r\nas the grapes are green and the vine in full activity we find scarcely\r\nany, or, at all events, very few spores which seem to belong to ordinary\r\nfungoid growths. Towards autumn, however, when the grape is ripening and\r\nthe leaves becoming yellow, fungoid growths and numerous productions of\r\ngreat fertility accumulate on the vine, on the leaves, the branches, and\r\nthe bunches. At this period we find the water in which the grapes and\r\nthe woody parts of the bunches are washed swarming with different kinds\r\nof organized corpuscles; it is at this period, too, that the\r\nferment-yielding moulds attain that phase of their vegetation in which,\r\nwhen mixed with the juice of grapes, they produce fermentation.\r\n\r\nIn the Jura district a peculiar kind of wine, called straw wine (_vin de\r\npaille_), is manufactured, which seems to contradict what we have said\r\nas to the advent of sterility towards the end of winter in the\r\nyeast-germs formed on the surface of preserved bunches of grapes. This\r\nstraw wine is made of grapes preserved for long after the vintage on\r\nstraw. From what we have said it might be supposed that fermentation\r\ncould not occur under these circumstances. We have, in fact, no doubt\r\nthat it is often really produced by quite different yeast-germs from\r\nthose which cause fermentation in the vintage gathered in autumn.\r\nFermentation as effected in the manufacture of straw wine is probably\r\ndue to yeast-dust spread over the utensils of the vine-grower, and\r\nderived from the preceding vintage. We have seen (Chap. III. § 6) that\r\nyeast may be dried and reduced to powder, and yet preserve its faculty\r\nof germination for several months. It would be useful, however, to\r\nsubmit this surmise to the test of experiment, and it would be easy to\r\ndo so provided we took care to crush the grapes so preserved in very\r\nclean vessels, previously heated to a temperature of 100° C. (212° F.),\r\nhaving first rejected every bunch containing injured grapes, which might\r\nhave fermented or given occasion to the development of yeast.\r\nFermentation, we believe, would not then take place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 10. One of the Ferments of Acid Fruits at the\r\nCommencement of Fermentation in its Natural Medium.]\r\n\r\nAnother consequence results from the various facts that we have brought\r\nout in relation to the origin of the wine-ferments, which is, that it\r\nwould be easy to cultivate one or more vine-stocks so that the grapes\r\ngathered from them, and crushed to extract their juice, would be unable\r\nto ferment spontaneously _even in autumn_. For this purpose it would be\r\nsufficient to keep the bunches out of contact with particles of dust\r\nduring the vegetation of the bunches and the ripening of the grapes, and\r\nthen to effect the crushing in vessels thoroughly freed from germs of\r\nalcoholic ferments. Moreover, every fruit and every vegetable might be\r\nsubmitted to important investigations of this kind, the results of\r\nwhich, in our opinion, could hardly be doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe following observations, which relate to the polymorphism of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_, seem to me to have an important bearing on\r\nthe history of alcoholic ferments, as presenting a close analogy between\r\nthe species of ferment and fungoid growths of a higher order, for\r\nexample, such fungi as _dematium_, which are generally found on dead\r\nwood; and we would say that between the vine and other shrubs there is\r\nonly this difference, that amongst the _dematium_ forms of the vine\r\nthere occur one or more which are anaërobian, at a certain period of the\r\nyear, whilst, on the other hand, the _dematia_, _alternaria_, &c., of\r\nother shrubs are more generally aërobian. There would be nothing\r\nsurprising in this result, considering that amongst the mucors, for\r\ninstance, we find both aërobian and anaërobian forms, and that there are\r\nlikewise torulæ-ferments or anaërobian forms, as well as torulæ-forms\r\nexclusively aërobian.\r\n\r\nWhen _saccharomyces pastorianus_ begins to develop from its natural\r\ngerms, such as are scattered over the surface of acid fruits, it takes\r\nthe form of elongated jointed filaments, branching, often pear-shaped,\r\nand more or less voluminous. In proportion as the oxygen held in\r\nsolution in the liquid disappears and the buddings are repeated, the\r\nlength and diameter of the filaments and cells diminish, and such is the\r\ntransformation that we might, at last, suppose that we were dealing with\r\na different ferment of smaller dimensions.\r\n\r\nPlate X. represents this ferment, at the commencement of fermentation in\r\ncherry juice. In the course of a short time there is nothing to be seen\r\nbut cells of comparatively small size, disjointed and round or oval, and\r\nfilaments comparatively short and slender. This appearance is indicated\r\nin our drawing by the cells _a_, _a_, _a_. As these latter forms\r\nmultiply with great rapidity, we soon have to search widely over the\r\nmicroscopic field before we find any of the long forms from which they\r\nspring. Instead of the forms given in Plate X., we have only those\r\nrepresented in Plate XI. In other words, the aspect of these ferments\r\nchanges daily, from the very commencement of fermentation. Thus the\r\nyeast would appear to grow smaller, coincidently with the progress of\r\nfermentation passing from a condition in which it consists of large\r\ncells and long ramified filaments, to a condition in which the cells are\r\nsmall and the filaments short. These changes are principally due to an\r\nalteration in the method of budding and in the life-processes of the\r\nyeast, which speedily exhibits itself when the air supply is reduced,\r\nand not through any intermixture of foreign ferments. So, at least, all\r\nour observations up to the present time lead us to believe. As soon as\r\nthe oxygen has been absorbed the cells which form are oval or globular,\r\nand the filaments do not lengthen or become so plump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 11. accharomyces Pastorianus, in course of Regular\r\nGrowth.]\r\n\r\nThis is, however, not the only cause of these changes in form and\r\naspect, although the presence of air, in greater or less quantity, has a\r\nmarked influence on the earlier developments of yeast; there is another\r\ncircumstance to be taken into account, difficult indeed to state\r\nshortly, but which is demonstrated clearly by the microscope, and is\r\nconnected with the actual state of the germ cells. As a general rule the\r\nbudding of a cell is not an identical process when the cell is quite\r\nyoung, and when it has become exhausted from want of nourishment.\r\nBetween these two conditions there is a difference which may be compared\r\nwith that which exists, for example, between a newly-formed grain which\r\nwould not germinate, and the same grain matured by rest, if we may use\r\nthe expression, that is, which has been kept long enough for its\r\ngermination to be possible. In other words, and as far as our subject is\r\nconcerned, we are not to expect that, by reviving our old yeast cells\r\nand putting them to grow with abundance of air, in a saccharine,\r\nnutritive medium, we shall obtain the appearance of the earlier\r\ndevelopments of the germ-cells on the surface of sweet and acid fruits.\r\nWe see this clearly in Plate VII., the right-hand half of which\r\nrepresents the recruited budding of cells, such as those represented in\r\nthe left-hand half, in a medium peculiarly adapted to their vitality,\r\n_and in the presence of much air_. As regards the length and size of\r\nfilaments and cells, there is little appreciable difference between the\r\ntwo sides. The principal difference consists in the relative freshness\r\nand the budding going on in individuals in the right-hand half.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple means of transforming the small, disjointed forms of\r\nthe yeast as it occurs in a deposit, at the end of a fermentation, back\r\ninto the long, tubular, pear-shaped forms peculiar to the germination of\r\nthe germ-cells, which exist amongst the particles of dust spread over\r\nthe surface of fruits. Plate X. illustrates the result of the process.\r\nFor this purpose we must effect as complete an exhaustion as possible of\r\nthe ferment _saccharomyces pastorianus_, by leaving it to itself for a\r\nvery long time, without aliment, in contact with pure air, in a damp\r\nstate; or, better still, in presence of sweetened water. We cultivate\r\nsome yeast in wort, in one of our two-necked flasks, and then carefully\r\ndecanting the fermented liquid through the right-hand neck, leave the\r\ndeposit of yeast on the sides of the flask. The glass stopper which\r\ncloses the india-rubber tube must be replaced, and the moist yeast be\r\nleft thus, in contact with pure air. The cells will steadily continue\r\ntheir activity, and so gradually age, without meanwhile losing their\r\nvitality. We use the word _age_, as we have already observed, because\r\nthe period of rejuvenescence in the case of such a yeast is so much the\r\nslower the longer the plant has remained in that state.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the yeast rarely dies. It becomes attenuated and\r\nshrivelled but still preserves its vitality, that is, the power of\r\nreproducing itself after a lapse of several months or even several\r\nyears. In the end, however, it dies, a fact which is proved by the\r\ncells, when sown in a nutritive medium, remaining inert.\r\n\r\nTo exhaust yeast, without destroying it, sweetened water is preferable.\r\nHaving decanted the beer, we substitute in its place water sweetened\r\nwith 10 per cent. of pure sugar. By effecting the substitution in the\r\nfollowing manner, we escape the risk of introducing germs from floating\r\nparticles of dust, which would nullify all experiments of this kind. We\r\nprepare, then, a flask containing sweetened water, free from all foreign\r\ngerms, which we attach to the other flask [_i.e._, two of M. Pasteur’s\r\nflasks with two necks, one straight and wide, the other bent and narrow\r\n(Fig. 8)]. This is done by taking the india-rubber tube off the flask\r\ncontaining yeast, and removing the glass stopper from the other\r\nindia-rubber tube attached to the flask containing the sweetened water;\r\nthen, introducing the right-hand neck of the yeast flask into the\r\nindia-rubber tube connected with the other, we raise the latter flask so\r\nas to pour the sweetened water on to the yeast. At the same time an\r\nassistant passes the flame of a spirit-lamp over the bent part of the\r\ncurved tube attached to the water flask, with the object of destroying\r\nthe vitality of the germs in the floating particles of dust, which enter\r\nthe flask in proportion as it is emptied into the other.\r\n\r\nThe sweetened water, which is thus brought into contact with yeast of\r\ngreater or less freshness, soon begins to ferment. Fermentation\r\naccomplished, the vinous liquid is decanted and replaced by fresh\r\nsweetened water, which ferments in its turn, although even at this stage\r\nwith greater difficulty than the first; this second dose is again\r\ndecanted, and again replaced by fresh sweetened water, and this process\r\nis repeated three or four times. The yeast becomes weaker and weaker,\r\nand eventually is unable to cause any fermentation in sweetened water\r\npoured on it.\r\n\r\nThis exhaustion of yeast in sweetened water may be produced more quickly\r\nby the following means:—It is sufficient to sow a mere trace of pure\r\nyeast in a large quantity of sweetened water, say 100 c.c. (nearly four\r\nfluid ounces), that is, instead of pouring the contents of a bottle of\r\nsweetened water upon the whole deposit of yeast in the flask which\r\ncontained the fermented wort, we simply take a little yeast, by means of\r\na fine tube, from the deposit at the bottom of the flask, and introduce\r\nit into the flask of sweetened water. This large proportion of liquid is\r\nitself sufficient to exhaust the small quantity of yeast, quickly\r\nchecking the feeble fermentation which it had induced, so feeble indeed\r\nas frequently not to be detected by the eye, from the fact that the\r\namount of liquid present is more than sufficient to dissolve any bubbles\r\nof carbonic acid gas that might otherwise have been liberated.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the yeast, which during its protracted stay\r\nin the sweetened water becomes enfeebled to such a degree that it can no\r\nlonger excite the least fermentation in that water, but will remain in\r\nits presence for an indefinite time in a state of inert dust, does not\r\ndie. In some of my experiments the yeast has remained alive in the\r\nsweetened water for more than two years.[94] It is almost unnecessary to\r\npoint out that these results are altogether out of keeping with the\r\nvarious properties that are usually attributed to yeast.[95]\r\n\r\nIn these experiments we may use yeast-water[96] instead of water\r\nsweetened with sugar. Into some flasks of pure yeast-water we put a\r\nlittle yeast, taking all precautions to prevent the introduction of\r\nforeign germs. No fermentation results, there being no sugar present;\r\nthe yeast, however, begins to bud, and this budding is more or less\r\nmarked according to the quantity of carbohydrate food which we introduce\r\nalong with the specimen. An interior chemical action also goes on,\r\ncausing a gradual change in the aspect of the yeast. The plasma of the\r\ncells collects about the centres, assuming a yellowish-brown colour,\r\nbecoming granular, and forming within the cells masses more or less\r\nirregular in shape, very rarely spherical.\r\n\r\nWe may observe here that these conditions seem to be peculiarly adapted\r\nto show the character of the interior sporulation of the cells\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Rees. Notwithstanding this we have never succeeded in\r\nfinding it distinctly, under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe fact which should claim all our attention, we repeat, is, that this\r\nexhausted, shrivelled-up, aged-looking yeast preserves its faculty of\r\ngermination for several years; that, moreover, this faculty may be\r\naroused by placing it in aerated nutritive media, in which case it will\r\nexhibit all the peculiarities which, under similar conditions,\r\ncharacterize some of the germ-cells found on the surface of our sweet\r\ndomestic fruits. In other words, this yeast, instead of multiplying, as\r\nit always does in the course of several growths in saccharine musts, in\r\nthe form of cells which detach themselves readily as soon as they have\r\nnearly attained the form and size of the mother-cells, begins to shoot\r\nout into such beautiful forms as those of _dematium pullulans_,\r\nproducing like that ferment long, well-grown, branching filaments, as\r\nwell as plump and frequently pyriform cells, as represented in Plate X.\r\n\r\nThe following figures (33 to 37) and descriptions of the observations to\r\nwhich they relate will furnish fresh proofs of our assertions. In these\r\nfigures we see _saccharomyces pastorianus_, which has been exhausted in\r\nsweetened water or in yeast-water, undergo revival in saccharine musts,\r\ngive rise to elongated, branching, pear-shaped forms, such as belong to\r\nthe original ferments of fruits, and afterwards assume the most minute\r\nforms that we find in fermentations progressing or completed.\r\n\r\nLet us examine Fig. 33. The history of this growth is as follows:—\r\n\r\nSome spontaneous yeast which, after repeated cultivation, had acquired\r\nthe aspect represented in Plate XI.—which aspect the _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_ generally assumes under these circumstances—was exhausted\r\nin sweetened water, and subsequently revived in must at 10° C. to 11° C.\r\n(51° F.). At this temperature germination was not very marked before the\r\nend of eight days; at a temperature of 20° C. (68° F.), it only took\r\nthree days, under similar conditions. The sketch includes but one of the\r\nlong branches from which the ferment cells and the budding joints took\r\nrise, but there were a great number more. Some of the forms represented\r\nin the figure bear a striking resemblance, it appears to us, to some of\r\nthose of _dematium_, in Plate IX.; and even we may trace out the several\r\npeculiarities of form which distinguish the figures in the latter plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nThe next figure (34) represents the earliest forms of germination of\r\nanother specimen of _saccharomyces pastorianus_ in wort, after it had\r\nbeen exhausted by four successive growths in sweetened water. We here\r\nsee the large ferment-form which appears at the commencement of\r\nfermentation, in acid fruits, such as cherries and gooseberries (Plate\r\nIX.), associated with smaller forms, which follow it and emanate from\r\nit, in proportion as the process of budding is repeated. The field was\r\ncovered with this minute form, and we had to search about considerably\r\nbefore we could find any of the large cells and the long, branching,\r\njointed filaments which we have sketched. The reason of this was, that\r\nthese large, extended filaments only appear at the beginning, when there\r\nis still an abundance of air, giving place, after repeated budding, to\r\nminute cells or short filaments, the ever-increasing number of which\r\nsoon hides the others from sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nFig. 35 represents _saccharomyces pastorianus_ again, as it appears\r\nafter having been exhausted by two years preservation in yeast-water, in\r\ncontact with pure air. Strange to say, it has lost its elongated\r\nappearance, and would appear to have originated from a round ferment.\r\nThe cells are much exhausted, and most of them seem to have a double\r\nborder; their interior is very granular and of a yellowish colour. One\r\nmight readily take the specimen to be a dead old ferment, which,\r\nhowever, it by no means is.\r\n\r\nFig. 36 represents the germination of this ferment, which had previously\r\nbeen revived in a flask of wort, at the temperature of the air, in May,\r\n1875. The following are the details of our observation:—\r\n\r\nWe sowed a trace of the exhausted yeast (Fig. 35) in a flask of wort on\r\nMay 16th. The sketch (Fig. 36) was made on May 19th, but on the 18th\r\nthere was a sensible revival. It will be seen how much the little\r\nferment had developed in the course of three days from the time when the\r\nprocess commenced. If we had waited a few days longer before taking our\r\nsample, we should probably have had difficulty in finding any cells or\r\nfilaments of the large ferment form, as there would have been so few of\r\nthem in comparison with the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\nIn the above figure we should remark the chain of large cells and\r\nlong-jointed processes, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ : _d_ is one of the cells\r\nthat we sowed; it has become transparent, and its contents, which are\r\nslightly granular, have lost their brownish tint; _c_ is a large cell\r\nwhich sprang from the preceding one; its outline is clear, and it is\r\nfull of fine, yellowish granules, which present a perfect resemblance to\r\nthe large ferment-cells of fruits, proceeding from the germ-cells on the\r\nsurface of those fruits, when it begins to appear in sweet juices; _b_\r\nis a long filament, sprung from the preceding cell; and, last of all,\r\n_a_ is a joint and its bud, in which the border is not yet very clearly\r\ndefined; it has scarcely any granules, and is finer than the others,\r\nbelonging, in short, to the small ferment form represented in Plate XI.\r\nHere, then, we see the transition of the large ferment to the small, on\r\nthe same branch, after two generations from the germination of the\r\ngerm-cell _d_. This observation corroborates the opinion maintained by\r\nus, that in Figs. 33, 34, 36, as in Plate X., we have not a mixture of\r\ntwo ferments, the one consisting of large, elongated filaments, the\r\nother of small cells, but one and the same ferment, the differences in\r\nthe form and size of which depend on particular conditions. The smallest\r\nferment-form very soon becomes the only one visible, and it preserves\r\nits peculiar appearance in successive growths from inability to return\r\nto the full, elongated, filamentous forms before undergoing a prolonged\r\nexhaustion. The ferment of _mucor_ would probably afford similar\r\nindications: it would be very interesting to find out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. 1 Div. = 1/450th of millimetre (1/11250th of\r\nin.).]\r\n\r\nThe following is one of the most curious of the forms presented by\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_, occurring after exhaustion in a sweet\r\nmineral liquid. The ferment, taken from a closed vat, in which it had\r\nbeen used for beer, was sown in the mineral liquid on July 4th, 1873.\r\nThe following days the ferment developed feebly, but perceptibly, and\r\ngradually increased in bulk. The flask was left to itself in an oven at\r\n25° C. (77° F.) until December 3rd, when we ascertained that all the\r\nsugar had fermented. We then sowed a trace of the deposit, which had\r\nbecome abundant, in a flask of pure wort. On December 4th there was no\r\nperceptible change. On December 5th, however, fermentation was in active\r\nprogress; a large quantity of froth covered the surface of the liquid,\r\nand a considerable deposit of ferment had already taken place at the\r\nbottom. We made a microscopical examination of this deposit, a sketch of\r\nwhich we append (Fig. 37). The dark, double-bordered cells are those\r\nwhich were sown but did not rejuvenesce. We may notice in different\r\nplaces several of these same cells, recognizable by their granular\r\ncontents, which they are beginning to lose, to make room for germinating\r\ncells and joints, often numerous. For instance, in the group at the\r\nbottom of our figure one of the cells is in course of rejuvenescence and\r\ngermination, and has given rise to no fewer than six cells, filaments,\r\nor groups of filaments. In different fields of our microscope we met\r\nwith a crowd of branches, more or less ramified, and chains of cells, of\r\ngreater or less length, of which we have sketched a few. In proportion\r\nas the budding of these branches is repeated, the cells and joints\r\nbecome more readily disunited, grow small, and assume the appearance of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_ in ordinary growths, almost as represented\r\nin Plate XI. At first, when the old, exhausted cells begin to germinate,\r\ntheir appearance rather resembles that of _dematium pullulans_, as seen\r\nin the germination of many of the corpuscles on the surface of clusters\r\nof grapes or fruits, or their woody parts, some specimens of which are\r\nto be found in Plate IX.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly summarize the leading facts demonstrated in the above\r\nparagraph. We have seen that there are different alcoholic ferments. In\r\nthe fermentation of natural saccharine juices, which, especially when\r\nacid, so readily undergo a decided alcoholic fermentation, the ferments\r\noriginate in certain germ-cells, which are spread in the form of minute\r\nspherical bodies of a yellow or brown colour, isolated or in groups,\r\nover the exterior surface of the epidermis of the plant, and which are\r\ngifted with an extraordinary power of budding with ease and rapidity in\r\nfermentable liquids. The presence of atmospheric oxygen is indispensable\r\nto the germination of these germ-cells, a fact which explains\r\nGay-Lussac’s observation that atmospheric oxygen is necessary for the\r\ncommencement of spontaneous fermentation in must.[97] Of these various\r\nferments one deserves special mention—namely, the variety termed\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_. As is the case with all ferments, when we\r\ngather it from the deposits produced in must that has been fermented by\r\nits action, it is composed entirely of oval or spherical cells or of\r\nshort joints. When again placed in a similar must it buds, like all the\r\nordinary ferments, and the buds detach themselves from the joints or\r\nmother-cells as soon as they have attained the size of these latter,\r\nfrom which time in the new deposit is reproduced the original\r\nferment-form from which it sprung, and so on. Under certain conditions\r\nof exhaustion, however, which may be easily obtained, and which we have\r\nalready accurately described, the cells undergo an absolute change as\r\nregards their capabilities of budding and germinating. Each cell,\r\nmodified in its structure by the conditions we have mentioned, shows a\r\ntendency to shoot out all around its surface, with astonishing rapidity,\r\ninto a multitude of buds, from many of which spring branching chains,\r\ncovered in parts, and more especially at the internodes, with cells and\r\njointed filaments, which fall off and bud in their turn, soon to present\r\nthe forms of the yeast deposit. In this way _saccharomyces pastorianus_\r\nseems to afford a kind of bond of union between the race of ferments on\r\nthe one hand, and certain kinds of ordinary fungoid growths on the\r\nother. Of these latter the plant which De Bary has named _dematium_, and\r\nwhich is generally found on the surface of leaves or dead wood, more\r\nespecially, however, on the wood of the vine at the end of autumn, the\r\ntime of the vintage, presents a striking example.\r\n\r\nThere seems every reason to believe that at this period of the year one\r\nor more of the varieties of _dematium_ furnish cells of yeast, or even\r\nthat the ordinary aërobian varieties of _dematium_ produce at a certain\r\nstage of their vegetation, in addition to aërobian cells and torulæ,\r\nother cells and torulæ which are anaërobian, that is, alcoholic\r\nferments.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we arrive at the confirmation of an idea entertained by\r\nmost authors who have studied yeast closely—namely, that it must be an\r\norgan detached from some more complex vegetable form. We may also add\r\nthat in the case of _saccharomyces_ the chains of filaments, both\r\ntubular and fusiform, and septate cells more or less pyriform\r\noriginating in them, when attentively observed, remind us forcibly of\r\nthe filamentous chains and spore-balls, or conidia of _mucor racemosus_\r\nwhen submerged, so that one might suppose that the spore-ferment of our\r\n_dematium_ is itself an organ detached from some still more complex\r\nvegetable form, in the same way that conidia-ferment of _mucor\r\nracemosus_ belongs to that more complex fungoid growth.\r\n\r\nIn the following passage De Bary uses, for the first time, the words\r\n_dematium pullulans_ (Hofmeister, vol. ii. p. 182, 1866). The German\r\nnaturalist begins by citing the opinions of Bail, Berkeley, and H.\r\nHoffmann, the first of whom maintains that _mucor mucedo_ becomes\r\ntransformed into the yeast of beer, the second that yeast is a peculiar\r\nstate of _penicillium_, and the third that it may be generated by fungi\r\nof very different nature, and especially by _penicillium glaucum_ and\r\n_mucor mucedo_. He goes on to say: “I have taken great pains to repeat\r\nthe experiments of Bail, Berkeley, and H. Hoffmann, but I have never\r\nbeen able to confirm the results which they have stated, either in the\r\ncase of growths in microscopic cells or in experiments performed in\r\ntest-tubes with the purest possible substances—specially prepared\r\nsolutions or must of wine and spores of penicillium, _mucor mucedo_,\r\n_botrytis cinerea_, &c.” On this point M. De Bary arrives at exactly the\r\nsame results which we communicated to the _Société Philomathique_ and\r\nthe _Société Chimique_ of Paris, as already given in Chap. IV. § 4, p.\r\n128, note.\r\n\r\nM. De Bary goes on to say: “In researches of this kind it is difficult\r\nto eliminate two sources of error. On the one hand, it is beyond doubt\r\nthat cells of ferment are actually scattered over everything, and that,\r\nconsequently, they may easily get into the experimental liquid along\r\nwith the spores that we sow, and so occasion mistakes. On the other\r\nhand, there are a great many fungi which develop budding processes\r\nsimilar to yeast, but incapable of producing fermentation, which yet in\r\nsome cases spring directly from spores as well as from mycelium,\r\nespecially we may instance _exoascus_. This last observation is\r\nespecially applicable to the extraordinarily numerous variety of fungi\r\nwhich rank under the Dematiei and Sphaeriacei, and which I shall term,\r\nfor convenience of naming, _dematium pullulans_.”[98]\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this paragraph with a remark that has doubtless\r\npresented itself to the minds of our readers, which is, that it would be\r\nimpossible to carry out the experiments we have described if we could\r\nnot make sure of dealing with pure ferments, or, at least, with mixtures\r\nthe components of which are sufficiently well known for us to assign to\r\neach the effect produced by it in the total phenomena observed. It would\r\nbe extremely difficult to continue growths of yeast-deposit in sweetened\r\nwater or in a moist atmosphere if the little plant were mixed with\r\nspores of other fungoid growths, a variety of ferment-forms, and germs\r\nof bacteria, vibrios, or infusoria in general. All these foreign\r\norganisms would tend to develop just in proportion as the conditions of\r\nthe media were more or less favourable to their growth, and, in a very\r\nfew days, our flasks would be filled with swarms of beings which, in\r\nmost cases, would entirely conceal the facts relating to those forms,\r\nthe separate study of which it was our object to follow out. We shall\r\nhave occasion, therefore, to examine, in a subsequent paragraph, the\r\npreparation of ferments in a state of purity. At present we may state\r\nthat yeast, which in its ordinary condition is a mass of cells so liable\r\nto change that its preservation in a moist state is impossible,\r\nmanifesting in the course of a few days during the winter, and in\r\ntwenty-four hours during the heat of summer, all the signs of incipient\r\nputrefaction, thereby losing its distinctive characteristics, is\r\nnevertheless capable, when pure, of enduring the highest atmospheric\r\ntemperatures for whole years without showing the least signs of putrid\r\nchange or contamination with any other microscopic organisms, and\r\nwithout the cells losing their power of reproduction. In the presence of\r\nfacts like these, the theory of spontaneous generation must seem\r\nchimerical. The hypothesis of the possible transformation of yeast into\r\n_penicillium glaucum_, bacteria, and vibrios, or conversely, which the\r\ntheories of Turpin, H. Hoffmann, Berkeley, Trécul, Hallier, and Béchamp\r\ninvolve, is equally refuted by these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § II.—On “Spontaneous” Ferment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expression _spontaneous ferment_ may be applied to any ferment that\r\nappears in a fermentable liquid without having been purposely sown in\r\nit. In this respect the ferments mentioned in the preceding paragraph,\r\nthose of all saccharine juices of fruit which ferment when left to\r\nthemselves—the ferments of wine, for example—are spontaneous. The term,\r\nhowever, is not altogether appropriate, because, after all, the process\r\nis the same as if an actual sowing had been made, since, as we have\r\nshown, it is absolutely necessary for the juice to come into contact\r\nwith the surfaces of the fruit, so that the ferment may be mixed with\r\nit, and so produce subsequent fermentation. Therefore, although we may\r\napply the term _spontaneous ferment_ to the ferments of fruits, we\r\nintend that expression to apply in this paragraph solely to those\r\nferments that are generated in a saccharine liquid, in which, by\r\nprevious boiling, we have destroyed all ferment germs, and which,\r\nnevertheless, enters into fermentation after being exposed in free\r\ncontact with air. In such a case it is entirely from the particles of\r\ndust floating in the air that the ferment germs that appear in the\r\nliquid are derived. Such are typical _spontaneous_ fermentations, and it\r\nis of the ferment so obtained that we are about to speak.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the researches which we undertook in order to ascertain\r\nwhether _mycoderma vini_, or vinous efflorescence, became transformed,\r\nin the case of beer, into actual alcoholic ferment—researches which were\r\nthe more protracted and varied in consequence of their leading to the\r\ncondemnation as erroneous, on the faith of new and more precise\r\nexperiments, such as those given in Chap. IV. § 2, of that\r\ntransformation, in which we had for long believed—we had occasion to\r\nobserve several spontaneous fermentations of this kind in various\r\nsaccharine liquids. We then proceeded to describe our method of\r\nconducting the experiments. Having brought about the development of a\r\nfilm of _mycoderma vini_ or _cerevisiæ_ on the surface of a liquid,\r\nfermented or not, we submerged that film in wort, which we afterwards\r\nput into long-necked flasks, in which alcoholic fermentation generally\r\ntook place in the course of a few days. This fermentation in no way\r\nresulted from the transformation of the cells constituting the\r\nefflorescence into ferment. The mycodermic film merely acted as a\r\nreceptacle of true ferment germs, wafted thither with the particles of\r\ndust floating in the air of the laboratory, which germs developed in the\r\nliquid into actual alcoholic ferments amongst the cells of the submerged\r\nmycoderma. By conducting experiments in this manner we brought about\r\nseveral spontaneous fermentations, the germs of which could have been\r\nintroduced by nothing but the particles of dust in the air. These\r\nfermentations, which we were obliged to follow very carefully with the\r\nmicroscope from the time when they first manifested themselves, on\r\naccount of the transformation that we were seeking, which transformation\r\nwe thought might possibly be that of the cells of _mycoderma vini_ into\r\ncells of ferment, generally gave us during the first days of\r\nfermentation the large, elongated, branchy ferment represented in Plate\r\nX., which was succeeded by the small ferment represented in Plate\r\nXI.[99]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 12. Ferment-cells from a Spontaneous Fermentation\r\njust starting.]\r\n\r\nHere let me describe one of these experiments. In the beginning of\r\nMarch, 1872, we grew some _mycoderma vini_, obtained from wine, on some\r\nwort contained in a shallow basin. On March 6th we submerged the\r\nefflorescence and put it all together, liquid and film, into a\r\nlong-necked flask. On March 9th we detected incipient fermentation, and\r\non March 12th we took a sketch of the yeast of the deposit, as given in\r\nPlate XII. This is the large and long branching, more or less\r\npear-shaped form, which occurs at the beginning of fermentation in the\r\nsweet and acid musts of our domestic fruits. On March 16th we made\r\nanother sketch of the deposit, in which the proportion of cells, in the\r\nform of elongated segments and filaments, reminded us, in some measure,\r\nof the filamentous mycelium of typical fungoid growths much diminished.\r\nIn this case, however, the majority of cells were oval, round, and in\r\nshort segments. On this day, March 16th, we added some fresh wort to\r\nthat which had fermented, with the object of prolonging the duration of\r\nfermentation and increasing the proportion of yeast. On March 19th we\r\nmade a fresh sketch, which it is not necessary either to reproduce;\r\nsuffice it to say, that the yeast was now considerably more regular and\r\nuniform in appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\nSpontaneous ferment, therefore, very often occurs in this large\r\nferment-form, which, by repeated developments in the act of\r\nfermentation, becomes reduced by degrees after successive generations to\r\nthe ferment which, following Dr. Rees, we have named _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_, a polymorphous ferment which must be studied closely that\r\nit may not be confounded with others, inasmuch as it is so universally\r\ndiffused that we very seldom fail to find it in any ferment which has\r\nbeen exposed in contact with ordinary air, at least, we may repeat, in a\r\nlaboratory devoted to researches on fermentation. We have found the same\r\nthing occur in a brewery, being there mixed with the ferments used in\r\nbrewing.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, several varieties of this _saccharomyces_. We\r\nsometimes find amongst the spontaneous ferments which repeated growths\r\nhave brought to a more or less uniform state, the forms represented in\r\nPlate XI., but the cells and segments much smaller. Amongst others, Dr.\r\nRees has distinguished a _saccharomyces exiguus_.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 represents another spontaneous ferment, which appeared in a\r\nboiled saccharine wort, which entered into fermentation after being\r\nexposed to the air of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe sketch was made directly after the fermentation had commenced.\r\nProbably this is simply one of the earlier forms assumed by the\r\n_saccharomyces_, or by one of its varieties. It will be seen that the\r\nalcoholic ferment is associated with another little filiform ferment,\r\nprobably the lactic. The spontaneous ferments are almost always impure,\r\na circumstance that may be readily understood if we bear in mind the\r\nresults described in Chapters III. and IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § III.—On “High” and “Low” Ferments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ferments mentioned in the preceding paragraphs do not belong,\r\nproperly speaking, to industrial products; that is to say, in actual\r\npractice there are no operations in which the ferments of fruits and\r\nspontaneous ferments are employed for the purpose. It is quite true that\r\nthese ferments are the cause of the fermentations from which wine,\r\ncider, gin, rum, gentiana, mead, &c., are derived, but these\r\nfermentations are spontaneous, they take place without the intervention\r\nof man, and without man’s directing their production, or taking any\r\nnotice of the agent which starts them.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of beer, on the other hand, the practice is quite\r\ndifferent. We may say that the wort is never left to ferment\r\nspontaneously, the fermentation being invariably produced by the\r\naddition of yeast formed on the spot in a preceding operation, or\r\nprocured from some other working brewery, which, again, had at some time\r\nbeen supplied from a third brewery, which itself had derived it from\r\nanother, and so on, as far back as the oldest brewery that can be\r\nimagined. A brewer never prepares his own yeast. We have already had\r\noccasion to remark that the interchange of yeasts amongst breweries is a\r\ntime-honoured custom, which has been observed in all countries at all\r\nperiods, as far back as we can trace the history of brewing. The yeasts\r\nwhich in the present day produce beer in the brewery of Tourtel, near\r\nNancy, in that of Grüber, at Strasburg, that of Dreher, at Vienna, and\r\nothers, came originally from breweries, where and when it would be hard\r\nto say. In the case of the first working brewery, the yeast was, no\r\ndoubt, derived from some spontaneous fermentation, which took place in\r\nan infusion of barley that had been left to itself, or, from some\r\nnatural spontaneous ferment, and nothing could be easier than to realize\r\nthis fact again. In the brewing industry there are two distinct modes of\r\nfermentation:—“high” fermentation and “low” fermentation, some of the\r\ndistinctive characteristics of which we have pointed out in Chapter I.\r\nIt may be questioned whether the spontaneous yeast employed in the first\r\nbrewery, or that which a wort left to itself in the present day would\r\nyield, would be of the “high” or “low” type. It may be concluded from\r\nwhat we have said on the subject of spontaneous fermentations in wort,\r\nthat wort, left to itself, would furnish ferments more or less\r\nresembling those of wine. We have never obtained in spontaneous\r\nfermentations of wort either a distinctly “high” ferment, or a\r\ndistinctly “low” one, properly so called; nor, further, have we ever\r\nobtained either one of these distinct kinds, with its industrial\r\ncharacteristics, in experiments on the ferments of fruits. What, then,\r\nwas the origin of the “high” and “low” ferments now used by brewers?\r\nWhat was the nature of their original germs? These are questions which\r\nwe are unable to answer, but we are very much inclined to think that we\r\nhave here another example of the modifications which plants as well as\r\nraces of animals undergo, and which become hereditary in the course of\r\nprolonged domestication. We know nothing of corn in its wild state, we\r\ncannot tell what its first grain was like. We know nothing of the\r\nsilk-worm in its original state, and we are ignorant of the characters\r\nof the race that furnished the first egg.\r\n\r\nThese reflections may seem to favour the supposition that there is a\r\nreal difference between “high” yeast and “low” yeast, and that both of\r\nthese differ from spontaneous ferments and the ferments of domestic\r\nfruits. These are propositions demanding most careful consideration, for\r\nit is generally admitted that these ferments become intermixed, that\r\ntheir morphological differences are merely a question of medium, and\r\nthat the transition of one to the other is a simple matter. The\r\nfollowing facts seem to contradict such statements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\n“High” Ferment.—Fig. 39 represents some “high” yeast taken from a\r\ndeposit after fermentation, and Fig. 40 the same yeast in course of\r\npropagation in some aerated wort. In comparing “high” yeast with other\r\nalcoholic ferments at the same stage of development, there are three\r\npoints which are especially striking: the diameter of its cells is\r\nrelatively large, their general aspect is rounder, and when they are\r\nundergoing propagation their mode of budding produces a markedly\r\nramified appearance, so that the cells always occur in clusters and\r\nbranches. Fig. 40 gives a very exact idea of these characters. To\r\ninvestigate satisfactorily the branching habit of growth peculiar to\r\nthis ferment we should examine it during the first few hours of its\r\npropagation, when, under the influence of the oxygen dissolved in the\r\nfermentable liquid, its vital activity is greatest. Later on, often on\r\nthe day following the sowing, the groups become disconnected, and at the\r\nend of the fermentation the cells have quite separated from each other,\r\nnot more than 2 or 3 per cent. remaining united, and even these in\r\ngroups of not more than two cells together. This is represented in Fig.\r\n39.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the rapidity with which this ferment multiplies, we\r\nmay state that our sketch (Fig. 40) was made under the following\r\nconditions:—On April 28th, 1874, we caused a flask of wort to ferment by\r\nmeans of a trace of “high” yeast. On the morning of the next day, that\r\nis fourteen hours afterwards, an appreciable deposit of yeast had\r\nformed, and some frothy patches appeared on the surface of the liquid,\r\nshowing that fermentation had set in. On May 1st we decanted the beer,\r\nsubstituting for it water sweetened with 10 per cent. of sugar. On May\r\n2nd we decanted the sweetened water, and substituted a fresh quantity\r\ncontaining the same percentage of sugar. On May 3rd, at mid-day, we took\r\nsome of the fermenting liquid from this flask and put it into a flask of\r\nwort; five hours after the introduction of the ferment we made the\r\nsketch in question. The field is covered with branching clusters, the\r\ngroups being sketched exactly as they occurred in the field. Their\r\nactivity was due to the condition of the ferment, and to the perfect\r\nfitness of the nutritive medium for its vegetation. In sweetened water\r\nthe budding of the cells was considerably less active; no branching\r\ngroups of cells are to be found. Budding, nevertheless, occurs to a\r\nconsiderable extent, but it is limited to one bud, or two at the most,\r\nto each cell. Fermentation in pure sweetened water is mostly correlative\r\nwith the duration of vital activity in the globules already formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nLet us next suffer our yeast to exhaust itself by keeping it in a great\r\nexcess of sweetened water for a very long time; we shall then be able to\r\nobserve its process of revival, and see if we can find any facts\r\nanalogous to those presented by _saccharomyces pastorianus_ (Chapter V.\r\n§ 1).\r\n\r\nWith this object in view, on May 6th, 1874, we impregnated two fresh\r\nflasks of sweetened water with some of the contents of the\r\nbefore-mentioned flask, which we had refilled with sweetened water on\r\nMay 2nd. On May 13th we decanted the liquid, which was still very sweet,\r\nfrom one of these two fresh flasks, which could hardly be said to have\r\nfermented at all—the quantity of yeast in them being so small—and\r\nreplaced it with some wort. Strange to say, on the morning of the 14th\r\nwe found an appreciable growth of yeast, and a froth of carbonic acid\r\ngas on the surface of the liquid. The yeast therefore was not dead,\r\nalthough its fermentative powers had been exhausted. There was, however,\r\nno remarkable feature in connection with its revival, nor did we find\r\nthe slightest trace of any of the elongated ferment-form. What we got\r\nwas simply the ramified groups of “high” yeast again, in round cells,\r\nbut nothing more.\r\n\r\nFearing that our yeast might not have remained for a sufficient time in\r\nthe sweetened water for exhaustion, we set aside, for a whole year, the\r\nother flask which we had prepared on May 6th. On May 16th, 1875, we\r\ndecanted the sweetened liquid and replaced it with wort. This time,\r\nhowever, there was no revival of the yeast; it had perished.\r\nFortunately, we had also saved the flask of yeast and sweetened water\r\nwhich was prepared on May 2nd, 1874, as already mentioned, and in this\r\ncase, as will be seen, the vitality of the yeast had not been\r\nextinguished, doubtless, in consequence of the formation of what we\r\nshall presently designate by the name of _aërobian ferment_. On May\r\n16th, 1875, we decanted the liquid from this last flask, and replaced it\r\nwith wort. On the next day the surface of the wort was covered with a\r\nthin froth, indicating the commencement of fermentation. The microscope\r\nrevealed nothing extraordinary, or indicative of the fermentation of any\r\nspecial ferment. To assure ourselves that our ferment had remained\r\n“high,” we sowed some of it in a fresh flask of wort on May 19th, and\r\nthen, seven hours after impregnation, submitting it to examination, we\r\ncould find nothing but ramified groups in fine condition, without a\r\nsingle elongated cell, indeed, it would have been impossible to find a\r\nmore beautiful specimen of “high” yeast, or one of a more decided\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that “high” yeast cannot, under any\r\ncircumstances, assume the form and character of the ferment\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_, or of other known ferments. We are\r\njustified, therefore, in regarding it as a distinct species of ferment,\r\nan opinion which is supported by other circumstances.\r\n\r\n1. In equal quantities of saccharine wort a considerably greater growth\r\nof “high” yeast is obtained than of other yeasts. We need no very\r\nrigorous proofs to convince ourselves of this fact: for by simply\r\ncausing equal volumes of the same wort to ferment, the one being pitched\r\nwith _saccharomyces pastorianus_, for example, the other with “high”\r\nyeast, we shall obtain a perceptibly greater volume of “high” yeast than\r\nof the other, in certain cases even five or six times as much.\r\n\r\n2. “High” yeast is of a tougher texture than the others, separating,\r\nwhen the fermented liquor and its deposit is shaken up, into lumps which\r\nrefuse to disappear; whereas _saccharomyces pastorianus_ diffuses\r\nthrough the whole liquid with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\n3. “High” yeast produces a special beer, with a peculiar flavour, well\r\nknown to consumers, but little esteemed at the present day. Hence the\r\ngradual displacement of breweries worked on the old “high” fermentation\r\nsystem by others in which “low” yeast (of which more anon) alone is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, one characteristic of “high” yeast, which it shares in common\r\nwith some other ferments, although not with all, and which, from a\r\npractical point of view, deserves special mention, is that as\r\nfermentation proceeds the yeast rises to the surface of the liquid.\r\nWhilst the process of the manufacture of beer by this ferment is going\r\non, the yeast is seen to work out of the bung-holes, flowing over in\r\nconsiderable quantity. The ferment named after the author, as well as\r\n“low” yeast, does not possess this property: it remains at the bottom of\r\nthe vessels. When “high” fermentation takes place in vessels that are\r\nnot filled, the ferment forms a thick layer, a kind of cap on the\r\nsurface of the beer. This characteristic may be witnessed even in the\r\nfermentation of very small quantities of liquid. In our flasks, in which\r\nthe volume of fermenting wort does not exceed 100 c.c. or 150 c.c.\r\n(about 4 or 5 fluid ounces), we may perceive, as the violence of\r\nfermentation subsides, and the head falls, the sides of the vessel\r\ncovered to a height of from 1 cm. to 2 cm. (about 3/4-in.) above the\r\nsurface of the liquid, with particles of yeasty matter, in little\r\nmasses, or in a thin film, raised to that height by the head, and left\r\nbehind when that fell.\r\n\r\n“Low” Ferment.—Whilst high yeast performs its functions in the breweries\r\nin which it is used at somewhat high temperatures—namely, between 16° C.\r\nand 20° C. (60° F. to 68° F.)—“low” yeast is never employed at a higher\r\ntemperature than 10° C. (50° F.), and it is even thought preferable that\r\nit should not be subjected to more than 6° C., 7° C., or 8° C. (43° F.\r\nto 46° F.). At these comparatively low temperatures “high” yeast would\r\nhave no perceptible action, whereas it is at such temperatures that\r\n“low” yeast best performs its functions.\r\n\r\nIn our Memoir on alcoholic fermentation, published in 1860, in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, the idea of the identity of the two\r\nyeasts was accepted; but we had at that time made no special\r\nobservations of our own on the subject.\r\n\r\nUpon closer investigation we are inclined to believe that the two yeasts\r\nare quite distinct. We might keep our “high” yeast at the lowest\r\ntemperatures that it can bear, and repeat our growths under these\r\nconditions; or, on the other hand, we might subject the “low” yeast to\r\ntemperatures higher than those at which it ordinarily grows, without\r\never succeeding in changing the first into the second or the second into\r\nthe first, supposing, of course, that each of our yeasts was pure to\r\nbegin with. If they were intermixed the change in the conditions of\r\ndevelopment would cause one or the other to preponderate, and incline us\r\nto believe that a transformation had really occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that brewers generally are of a different opinion. Most of\r\nthem assert that “low” yeast cultivated at a high temperature becomes\r\n“high” yeast; and conversely, that “high” yeast becomes “low” by\r\nrepeated growths at a low temperature. Many have told us that they have\r\nproved this. Nevertheless it is our belief that the success of such\r\ntransformation has been but apparent, attributable in each case to the\r\nfact, as we have just stated, of their having operated on a mixture of\r\nthe two yeasts.\r\n\r\nMitscherlich, and various authors after him, have asserted that “high”\r\nyeast propagates by budding, and “low” yeast, on the contrary, by\r\nspores, formed by the endogenous division of the protoplasm of the\r\ncells, and set free by the rupture of the cell-wall, which then,\r\nincreasing in size, assume the character of ordinary cells. But we have\r\nnever been able to confirm this.\r\n\r\nFig. 41 represents a field of low yeast, taken from the deposit in a vat\r\nafter the fermentation of the beer was finished. The granular matter\r\nmixed with the cells is altogether amorphous although in many cases\r\nperfectly spherical. It is a product in no way related to this yeast\r\n(see Plate I., No. 7).[100] “High” yeast and all the ferments of beer\r\nhave this kind of deposit associated with them. There is no doubt that\r\nconfused observations as regards these minute bodies have been the cause\r\nof the error which we had to deal with in connection with a particular\r\nmode of reproduction of low yeast, as to which we have already fully\r\nexpressed our views (Chap. V. § 1, p. 146).\r\n\r\nComparing Fig. 41 with Fig. 40 (p. 189), it may be seen that the general\r\naspect of low yeast is distinguished, in its early stages, although in\r\nno very decided manner, from that of “high” yeast, by being slightly\r\nsmaller and less round or spherical in its cells than the latter.[101]\r\nThese differences, however, would escape an unpractised eye.\r\n\r\nAs to the case of “high” yeast, the deposits of “low” yeast after\r\nfermentation appear as scattered, isolated cells; we do not find more\r\nthan two or three per cent. of united cells. Nevertheless the two yeasts\r\npresent, as we shall see, quite marked differences in the character of\r\ntheir budding and multiplication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nOn May 28th, 1875, we put a trace of pure, unicellular, “low” yeast,\r\ntaken at the end of a fermentation, into a flask of wort. On May 29th,\r\nsixteen hours after impregnation, the temperature during the night\r\nhaving been 15° C. (59° F.), we made a sketch of the yeast before its\r\ndevelopment had become apparent to the naked eye. No perceptible\r\ndevelopment, that is to say, no visible deposit at the bottom of the\r\nliquid and formation of patches of froth on the surface, took place\r\nbefore May 30th. A mere glance at Fig. 42 will be sufficient to enable\r\nus to detect a considerable difference between it and Fig. 40, which\r\nrepresents the multiplication of the cells of “high” yeast. The cells of\r\nthe “low” yeast are slightly smaller and rather more oval, as we have\r\nalready had occasion to notice, and the budding processes are\r\nconsiderably less ramified, in consequence of which there is a\r\ncomparative absence of globular clusters which are so striking a feature\r\nin the development of “high” yeast, when examined early enough.\r\nMoreover, if we cause our “low” yeast to age, by leaving it for a longer\r\nor shorter time in the beer which it has formed, or if we exhaust it in\r\nsweetened water by leaving it for whole months in a volume of sweetened\r\nwater considerably larger than what it is capable of fermenting, and\r\nthen proceed to revive it and cause it to propagate in an aerated\r\nsaccharine wort capable of nourishing it, this yeast will resume its\r\noriginal aspect, as sketched and described. At most we shall observe\r\ncertain minute differences in the size of the cells in successive\r\ngrowths. A very remarkable industrial characteristic of this yeast is\r\nthe fact that it never rises to the surface, no matter at what\r\ntemperature it may be working, whether between 6° C. and 8° C. or 15° C.\r\nand 20° C.;[102] in other words, it is not buoyed up by the carbonic\r\nacid gas when the fermentation is at its height. At the end of the\r\nfermentation, the surface of the liquid and the sides of the vessel\r\nabove the level of the liquid are clean and not covered with the yeast,\r\nwhich remains altogether at the bottom of the fermented liquid.\r\nMoreover, the weight of new yeast which it yields is always less than\r\nthat yielded by “high” yeast, for the same quantity of fermentable\r\nliquid, although greater than that which _saccharomyces pastorianus_\r\nwould give. Lastly, the beer possesses a flavour and delicacy which\r\ncause it to be held in higher esteem by consumers than beers produced by\r\nmeans of other ferments.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\n   § IV.—On the Existence and Production of Other Species of Ferment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur present knowledge of the alcoholic ferments embraces the following,\r\nwithout taking into account the ferment-form of _mucor_:—\r\n\r\nThe ferment named after the author, which is found associated with the\r\nferments of the grape and other domestic fruits, and with spontaneous\r\nferments in general.\r\n\r\nThe ferment of “high” beer.\r\n\r\nThe ferment of “low” beer.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added the ordinary ferment of wine, and that called\r\n_apiculatus_, although, indeed, these last are of little practical\r\nimportance, since, in general, they soon become lost amongst others of\r\ngreater vitality, in the spontaneous fermentation of fruits. These are\r\nnot the only alcoholic ferments; a study of the germ-cells diffused over\r\nthe surface of fruits, grains, and stalks of all vegetables in different\r\ncountries, would doubtless lead to the discovery of many new ones. We\r\nare even inclined to believe that one ferment might give rise to a\r\nmultitude of others. The investigations which we have undertaken in this\r\ndirection are as yet not far advanced; we may, however, be allowed\r\nmerely to state the principle which governs them. A ferment is a\r\ncombination of cells, the individuals of which must differ more or less\r\nfrom each other. Each of these cells has certain generic and specific\r\npeculiarities which it shares with the neighbouring cells; but over and\r\nabove this, certain peculiar characteristics which distinguish it, and\r\nwhich it is capable of transmitting to succeeding generations. If,\r\ntherefore, we could manage with some species of ferment to isolate the\r\ndifferent cells that compose it, and could cultivate each of these\r\nseparately, we should obtain as many specimens of ferments, which would,\r\nprobably, be distinct from one another, inasmuch as each of them would\r\ninherit the individual peculiarities of the cell from which it\r\noriginated. Our endeavours are directed to realizing this result\r\npractically, by first thoroughly drying a ferment and reducing it to\r\nfine powder. We have seen (Chap. III. § 6) that this mode of experiment\r\nis practicable, that in a powder composed of yeast and plaster the\r\nferment preserves its faculty of reproduction for a very long time. If\r\nwe now drop a small quantity of this powder from a sufficient height,\r\nand then, at a certain distance below the cloud of dust so formed, open\r\nseveral flasks previously deprived of air and containing a fermentable\r\nliquid that has been boiled, immediately closing them all up again,\r\nunder such circumstances it is conceivable that some of the cells of\r\nyeast diffused in the cloud of dust, and separated widely in the act of\r\nfalling, will enter some of our flasks singly, and there develop an\r\nappreciable weight of ferment, all the cells of which will have sprung\r\nfrom the same mother-cell. We have proved that flasks may be easily\r\nimpregnated under these conditions, and our preliminary observations,\r\nalthough incomplete, seem to favour the idea that numerous varieties of\r\nferment are to be obtained by these means.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous ferments, properly so called, of which we have already\r\nspoken, are, after all, the result of sowings of this kind. Originating\r\nin liquids which have been boiled, and then left to themselves in\r\ncontact with the air in a place where cells or germs must have existed,\r\nthese ferments must necessarily often spring from single germs or from a\r\nlimited few, and this also would probably be a means of developing\r\ndistinct varieties of ferments.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling longer on the practical consequences likely to result\r\nfrom the ideas which we have just expressed, we shall proceed to\r\ndescribe two new alcoholic ferments, which differ widely from those\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\n_New “High” Ferment._—We met with this ferment accidentally, under the\r\nfollowing circumstances:—On February 12th, 1873, we had brewed in the\r\nlaboratory about 2-½ hectolitres (rather over 50 gallons) of wort, 10\r\nlitres (about two gallons) of which were set aside to cool in a\r\nwhite-iron trough, and left during the night exposed to free contact\r\nwith air in the underground part of the laboratory, where we have a\r\nsmall experimental brewery. Next day we put some of this latter into a\r\nbottle; the wort soon began to show evidence of change, various\r\nproductions made their appearance on the surface of the liquid, and a\r\ndeposit of yeast settled at the bottom. On May 23rd, perceiving bubbles\r\nof gas and a steady fermentation set up in the wort, which remained all\r\nthe time corked up, and fearing that the bottle might burst by the\r\nincreasing internal pressure, we drew the cork. A considerable\r\nliberation of gas at once took place, accompanied by a voluminous foam\r\nwhich half emptied the bottle. A microscopical examination of the\r\ndeposit from the disturbed liquid led to the discovery of a very\r\nhomogeneous yeast, associated with various other organisms; it was\r\nclearly a yeast which we had not hitherto met with amongst the\r\nspontaneous ferments which we had had occasion to study. Thinking that\r\nthis might be a new species of ferment which would probably produce a\r\nbeer that was also unknown, we set to work to purify it by cultivation\r\nin flasks of pure wort, during the months of May, June, and July. Our\r\nlast growths, of August 4th, 1873, were preserved, in order that we\r\nmight assure ourselves of the purity of the beer, and, consequently, of\r\nthe ferment. On November 15th its purity was established. On that date\r\nwe made some beer with this ferment, which had now been left to itself\r\nfor several months in contact with pure air. The beer which we obtained\r\nresembled no known variety; consequently the ferment must itself have\r\nbeen a distinct one, differing from others, especially those which we\r\nhave been considering in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nFig. 43 represents the rejuvenescence of this ferment. Comparing this\r\nfigure with Fig. 42, we see that this ferment presents a considerable\r\nresemblance to “low” yeast in dimensions, method of budding, and oval\r\nshape; but the feature which distinguishes it essentially from “low”\r\nyeast is that it rises to the surface, like “high” yeast. Buoyed up by\r\nthe gas during fermentation, it forms a layer of yeast on the surface of\r\nthe fermenting liquid, where it remains after the head has fallen. Some\r\nof this head of yeast likewise adheres to the sides of the vessel above\r\nthe level of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIn short, by the greater regularity of its forms and the uniform\r\ndimensions of its cells, this ferment is to be easily distinguished from\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_; its aspect, which is oval instead of\r\nspherical, and the ramified form of its chains of cells, which is less\r\nmarked than in the case of “high” yeast, also prevent our confounding it\r\nwith the latter ferment; in its rising character it differs absolutely\r\nfrom “low” yeast; lastly, it may be distinguished from all other\r\nferments by the flavour of the beer that it produces.\r\n\r\nThe ferment which we discovered in this accidental way may be utilized.\r\nIndeed, we may ask, is it not to be found already in our beer? We are\r\ninclined to believe that it is. After the war of 1870, some Viennese\r\ntraders established at Maisons-Alfort, near Paris, a manufactory of\r\nyeast for bakers. They saccharified by means of malt a mixture of the\r\nmeals of rye, maize, and barley, which they then caused to ferment. One\r\nday we had occasion to study the yeast produced in this establishment,\r\nand although we did not submit it to a sufficient number of consecutive\r\nexperiments to enable us to speak positively, we are under the\r\nimpression that the yeast produced at Maisons-Alfort is a “high” one,\r\ndiffering from what may be properly termed the “high” yeast of breweries\r\nin which “high” fermentation is practised, but presenting a great\r\nresemblance to the “high” yeast of which we have been speaking. It would\r\nbe interesting to confirm the opinion of their possible identity by\r\nfresh studies, and the best way of doing this would be to compare the\r\nqualities of beer which the two yeasts could produce.\r\n\r\n_Caseous Ferment._—We give the title caseous for a reason that will\r\npresently appear, to a ferment which we came across also accidentally.\r\nWe were trying different methods of purifying yeasts, and for this\r\npurpose had composed a liquid formed of:\r\n\r\n      Ordinary wort                                 150 c.c.[104]\r\n      Water saturated with bi-tartrate of potash    50 c.c.\r\n      Alcohol of 90°                                25 c.c.\r\n\r\nQuantities of this liquid were placed in several of our double-necked\r\nflasks, submitted to boiling, then, after cooling, impregnated with\r\ndifferent ferments, and kept in a water-bath at 50° C. (122° F.) for one\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIn operating under these conditions with brewers’ “high” yeast, say, for\r\ninstance, with what is called Dutch yeast, a kind well known in\r\ndistilleries, fermentation shows itself in the course of a few days, in\r\nspite of the increased temperature to which our liquid, which is hopped\r\nand slightly acid and alcoholic, has been subjected. The time required\r\nfor the resumption of fermentation depends both upon the degree of\r\ntemperature to which the yeast has been exposed and upon the duration of\r\nits exposure. These, however, are not the points upon which we now wish\r\nto dwell. It is of greater importance to notice that the new yeast has\r\nnone of the characteristics of “high” ferment, of which Dutch yeast\r\nseems to be exclusively composed, if we do not take into account\r\nimpurities which cannot be avoided in a commercial product of this\r\nnature. Other specimens of Dutch yeasts would give the same results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 44 and 45 represent this new ferment magnified to the same extent\r\nas the other ferments have generally been, that is 400/1; it will\r\nreadily be seen how different its form is from that of “high” yeast, how\r\nfar it is from having the spherical aspect and mode of budding\r\ncharacteristic of that ferment. In Fig. 45 the ferment is represented in\r\na mass; in Fig. 44 we see the ramified groups, the cells and segments of\r\nwhich form, after separation, the yeast of the deposit. It thus appears\r\nto be composed of jointed branches of greater or less length, which, at\r\nthe junctions of the segments, put forth similar cells or segments of a\r\nround, oval, pyriform, cylindrical, or other shape; in all its\r\ncharacters recalling the description of _dematium_. Moreover, the cells\r\nand segments exhibit a greater sharpness of outline, as well as a more\r\nmarked transparency and refractive power than are found in the majority\r\nof ferments; but the most curious physical characteristic of this\r\nferment is its plasticity and elasticity, if we may use those terms. It\r\ncan only be made to diffuse through water with great difficulty; when\r\nshaken up in it, it sinks to the bottom quickly as a clotted sediment,\r\nand the supernatant liquid appears scarcely at all charged with globules\r\nin suspension. Again, when placed on a microscope slide and compressed\r\nby the cover-glass, it returns to its original form on removal of the\r\npressure. It is from these considerations that we have given to it the\r\nname of _caseous ferment_.[105] Lastly, this ferment produces a beer of\r\na peculiar kind, which cannot be confounded with other kinds of beer\r\nknown in the present day. We should add that it preserves its\r\ncharacteristics in repeated growths, and that we have never found it\r\nreproduce ordinary “high” yeast.\r\n\r\nWhen caseous ferment is sown in a saccharine medium charged with mineral\r\nsalts, its aspect, form, and mode of budding differ completely from what\r\nthey are when the ferment exists in a natural medium, such as wort or\r\nother liquid adapted to the nutrition and life of ferments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nFig. 46 represents this ferment in course of development, forty-eight\r\nhours after it had been sown in a saline medium (we employed Raulin’s\r\nfluid, substituting bi-tartrate for the nitrate of ammonia). It will be\r\nseen how different its aspect is from that of the preceding figures; it\r\nis still capable, however, of resuming the forms of the latter if\r\ncultivated afresh in natural saccharine worts.\r\n\r\n“High” yeast from a “high” fermentation brewery in the Ardennes, after\r\nhaving been exposed to heat under the conditions given above, likewise\r\nproduced caseous ferment, without a trace of “high” ferment, just as\r\nhappened in the case of the Dutch yeast. All the “high” yeasts used in\r\nbrewing seem to behave in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion are we to draw from these facts? Apparently that “high”\r\nyeast is modified by heat in an acid and alcoholic medium, giving rise\r\nto caseous ferment. On the other hand, it might be conceived that the\r\n“high” yeasts on which we experimented were not pure, but contained, in\r\na state of intermixture, some caseous ferment, and that by the\r\napplication of a temperature of 50° C. (122° F.) to our alcoholic\r\nmedium, the high ferment was all killed and the caseous ferment alone\r\nsurvived. It is a remarkable fact that this latter hypothesis,\r\nimprobable as it seems, inasmuch as the microscope revealed no\r\nintermixture of ferments, seems, nevertheless, to be a true one. As a\r\nmatter of fact, if we subject to a temperature of 50° C. for one hour in\r\nthe medium in which it acts, not the “high” yeast of commerce but “high”\r\nyeast that is _absolutely pure_, this will perish utterly, and the wort\r\nafter cooling may remain for years in an oven without either undergoing\r\nfermentation or developing any growth whatever of “high” ferment or\r\n“caseous” ferment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we impregnate this same alcoholic liquid with some\r\nof the caseous ferment and then heat the vessel to 50° C. for one hour,\r\nthe caseous ferment will go on reproducing itself after the liquid has\r\ncooled down.[106]\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, impossible to admit that caseous ferment results\r\nfrom a modification of “high” ferment, and we are led to believe that in\r\nthe preceding experiments it must have been the progeny of cells of\r\ncaseous ferment present in the “high” yeasts of commerce, which cells,\r\nprobably in consequence of their scarcity, the microscope was unable to\r\nreveal, but which, nevertheless, did exist, and went on reproducing\r\nthemselves alone after the heating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is supported by the following fact, which also tends to\r\nprove that in the case of the “high” English _pale ales_, caseous\r\nferment plays a most important part. In the medium already described, we\r\nsowed the deposit from a bottle of good English pale ale. After having\r\nbeen heated the yeast went on growing, and we obtained the very\r\nbeautiful specimen of caseous ferment represented in Fig. 47. The two\r\ndark globules are dead cells which had been killed. Two minute segments\r\nof lactic ferment are also visible in the sketch—the yeast which we\r\nsowed was, of course, impure—and their presence proves, we may observe,\r\nby the way, that lactic ferment also can withstand a temperature of 50°\r\nC. (122° F.) in the medium which we here employed. The yeast as sowed is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 48; it reminds us forcibly of certain forms of the\r\ncaseous ferment. Amongst the globules, which for the most part were\r\ntransparent and very young, there were some which appeared aged and of a\r\nyellowish colour and granular. These latter probably belonged to the\r\nyeast of manufacture. Their shape distinguishes them from “high” yeast,\r\nproperly so called, as on the other hand it causes them to appear more\r\nlike cells of a recent growth to which, there is no doubt, beer, after\r\nit is put in bottle, owes its effervescence and head. These various\r\ncircumstances incline us to believe that the caseous ferment forms part\r\nof certain commercial yeasts, especially those used in the celebrated\r\nbreweries of Bass and Allsopp, at Burton-on-Trent, in the manufacture of\r\npale ale. Caseous yeast is, moreover, a “high” ferment, that is to say,\r\nit rises to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      § V.—On a New Race of Alcoholic Ferments: Aërobian Ferments.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of certain researches which we undertook\r\nwith the object of ascertaining whether _mycoderma vini_, or\r\nefflorescence of wine, and _mycoderma cerevisiæ_, or efflorescence of\r\nbeer, which grow equally well in all fermented liquids, have the power\r\nof becoming transformed into actual alcoholic ferment. The result of\r\nthose researches was stated to be that these mycodermata do not become\r\ntransformed into ferment, properly so called, and that whenever any such\r\ntransformation has been supposed to have taken place, the ferment\r\nproduced was derived from germs introduced by the air or by the utensils\r\nemployed. What we did ascertain of the ferment-producing power of\r\n_mycoderma vini_, was merely that this plant, when submerged, is capable\r\nof causing sugar to ferment, in consequence of a certain continuous life\r\npossible to its cells, apart from the oxidations resulting from the\r\npresence of free oxygen, but without any generation of new cells taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhilst engaged in these researches, we were pursuing others in relation\r\nto the converse of the proposition just discussed, that is to say,\r\nrespecting the possibility of ferment becoming transformed into\r\n_mycoderma vini_ or _mycoderma cerevisiae_. Our experiments in\r\nconnection with this subject chiefly consisted in various endeavours by\r\nway of exhausting the yeast and subsequent revival of its growth. This\r\nexhaustion was effected by growing the yeast in excess of sweetened\r\nwater, and at other times in unsweetened yeast-water, our efforts being\r\ndirected to deprive it of all power of fermenting. We afterwards caused\r\nit to develop afresh in highly aerated, nutritious liquids, in order\r\nthat we might see how it reproduced itself, and if its new form were\r\nthat of a mycoderma. The yeast after having lost its power as a ferment,\r\nand being no longer able to act in pure sweetened water, nevertheless\r\nreproduced itself when placed in fermentable media, holding in solution\r\nmaterials adapted to its nutrition; yet we never succeeded in obtaining\r\nany organism besides the ferment, and, indeed, the identical variety of\r\nferment on which we had operated. In no case was _mycoderma vini_ or\r\n_cerevisiæ_ produced, and we concluded that we were justified in stating\r\nthat whenever the _mycoderma vini_ appeared on the surface of a\r\nfermented or fermentable liquid, its germ must have been introduced by\r\nthe surrounding air, or have previously existed in the liquid, and that\r\nthe reason why this germ multiplied so abundantly was because the liquid\r\nin question had been peculiarly adapted to the vitality of the plant.\r\n\r\nIn a laboratory where alcoholic fermentations are studied, these germs\r\nof _mycoderma vini_ exist in great abundance on the surfaces of\r\ndifferent objects. This fact admits of easy proof; we have merely to\r\nopen in such a laboratory some flasks containing yeast-water deprived of\r\nair, or yeast-water sweetened, or any natural saccharine medium, or any\r\nfermented liquid, which till the moment when our flasks were closed had\r\nbeen kept boiling (Chap. IV.); it would be a very rare thing, indeed, if\r\n_mycoderma vini_ did not develop in most of these flasks after the air\r\nwas readmitted, especially if, shortly before this operation, the dust\r\nlying on the surface of the tables or floor of the laboratory had been\r\nstirred up by dusting or sweeping.\r\n\r\nThis series of experiments, the salient points of which we have just\r\ngiven, conducted with a view to ascertain whether yeast could be\r\ntransformed into mycoderma, has led the way to certain results of\r\nspecial interest, results which concern all alcoholic ferments, and\r\nwhich in all probability will be found in the long run to apply to all\r\naërobian ferments.\r\n\r\nIt being necessary for the conduct of our experiments to preserve our\r\nyeast in a state of purity for an indefinite period, often for a great\r\nlength of time, in contact with pure air, we discovered that yeast was\r\npossessed of extraordinary vitality, and that it rarely perished\r\ncompletely throughout, inasmuch as we could almost invariably cause it\r\nto revive by bringing it into contact with fresh, fermentable liquid.\r\nThis revival of the yeast—and it is to this point that we are most\r\nanxious to direct the attention of our readers—is effected from two\r\ndistinct sources:—\r\n\r\n1. By those cells of yeast which have not perished.\r\n\r\n2. By cells of new formation.\r\n\r\nWe may give an example to explain this more clearly. In one of our\r\ntwo-necked flasks we cause some pure wort to ferment by employing yeast\r\nalso in a state of purity. Fermentation completed, we leave the liquid\r\nto itself, not touching the flask again. The fermented liquor covers a\r\ndeposit of yeast, apparently inert, and no trace of _mycoderma vini_\r\nmakes its appearance on the surface of the liquid. Let us suppose that\r\nwe go on daily for a considerable time introducing a little of the yeast\r\nfrom this flask to a different flask of wort: the fresh flasks will\r\nbegin to ferment. The only appreciable difference which these successive\r\nflasks will present, their impregnation having been effected at\r\nintervals of twenty-four hours, will be that, _ceteris paribus_,\r\nfermentation in them will be more and more slow in making its\r\nappearance. This difference, as we have already explained, will be due\r\nto the fact that the yeast in the first flask will, in the course of\r\ntime, undergo, in each of its cells, a process which we cannot better\r\ndescribe than as a progressive _senescence_. The cells gradually become\r\nfilled with amorphous granulations, their interior becomes yellow, and\r\nthe protoplasm collects, either at the centre or near the borders; in\r\nshort, the vitality of the yeast becomes feeble. When, however, it is\r\ntaken out of the liquid in which it has fermented and introduced into a\r\nfresh saccharine wort, it gradually resumes its transparency, and then\r\nbegins to germinate. These effects are the less rapidly brought about\r\nthe longer the cells remain exhausting themselves in the first fermented\r\nliquid. They might be left in that liquid for such a length of time that\r\nthey would eventually perish, a fact which would manifest itself in\r\ntheir absolute sterility and quiescence when sown in a fresh medium. In\r\ngeneral, however, matters are not carried far enough for this to take\r\nplace, and the yeast, preserved in a state of purity in its fermented\r\nliquid, retains the capacity of revival, which may then go on\r\nindefinitely. As a matter of observation, the cells of yeast, after\r\ncausing the liquid to ferment, instead of remaining inactive, and so by\r\nliving at their own expense gradually passing into a state of\r\nexhaustion, begin to bud again; at least this is true of many of them.\r\nMultiplying afresh in the fermented medium, under the influence of the\r\nair, they form a kind of mycodermic film on the liquid surface, or a\r\nring round the sides of the flask, on a level with the liquid. This\r\ndevelopment might often be mistaken for _mycoderma vini_ or _cerevisiæ_;\r\nin reality there is not a single cell of _mycoderma_ formed. If we sow a\r\ntrace of the new growth in a saccharine medium it will behave exactly as\r\nyeast would, budding and multiplying, and setting up fermentation in the\r\nliquid. And thus, in spite of its mycodermic aspect, this growth is\r\nnothing but yeast, since it gives rise to true alcoholic fermentation;\r\nbut it is a kind of yeast which, under the foregoing conditions, lives\r\nafter the manner of fungoid growths, absorbing the oxygen of the air and\r\nemitting carbonic acid gas. It appears on the surface of all fermented\r\nliquids, especially those which, like beer, contain carbohydrates, and\r\nits quantity is the greater, and its action the more rapid, in\r\nproportion as it has more perfect access to the air. We have termed this\r\nyeast _aërobian ferment_ or _fungoid ferment_.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be understood how this kind of production has escaped\r\nnotice up to the present time. The conditions of our experiment were, in\r\nmany respects, novel; a saccharine liquid had never before been caused\r\nto ferment by means of pure yeast, absolutely free from foreign germs; a\r\nfermented liquid had not previously been exposed to contact with pure\r\nair for an indefinite time. On the other hand, all ordinary fermented\r\nliquids, when left to themselves in contact with air, are a ready prey\r\nto _mycoderma vini_ or _aceti_ at their surface, and then give rise to\r\ntrue fungoid growths. The appearance of these organisms, which always\r\ntakes place soon, has thus constantly concealed or prevented the\r\ndevelopment of the true aërobian ferments. In repeating the experiment\r\ndescribed any alcoholic ferment may be used, and each one will be found\r\nto produce its own peculiar fungoid form of ferment. Another point\r\nworthy of notice is that these aërobian ferments, when they put forth\r\nbuds in the act of fermentation, reproduce the forms of the original\r\nferment, at least apparently so. In this respect they cannot be\r\ndistinguished, notwithstanding the fact, surprising as it seems, that\r\nthe two kinds of ferments are not identical. If we operate on a “low”\r\nyeast its aërobian ferment will differ physiologically from the ferment\r\nfrom which it sprung, presenting various special peculiarities which are\r\nnot to be found in the original “low” yeast. In most of our experiments\r\nwe have found the new aërobian ferment to be similar in its action to\r\n“high” yeast, rising to the surface, and producing a beer which\r\npossesses a greater fragrance than beer brewed with the identical “low”\r\nyeast from which it was derived. Lastly, the properties of an aërobious\r\nferment are not peculiar to first growth, but are hereditary; by\r\nrepeating the growth of the first aërobian ferment we do not cause them\r\nto disappear, we find them again in succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these facts, it would be difficult to discover any very\r\nappreciable differences between the forms of the cells of any particular\r\nyeast and those of its aërobian ferment in course of development. So\r\ntrue is this, that the aërobian ferment of _saccharomyces pastorianus_\r\nmight even be caused to put on the forms of _dematium pullulans_, which\r\nwe have had occasion to observe specially characterize this ferment\r\nafter the cells have been subjected to a prolonged process of\r\nsenescence.[107] This is evident from the following example, which will\r\nonce again show the remarkable extent to which the forms of a particular\r\norganism may be varied by changes in composition of the nutritive\r\nmedium:—\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 1873, we took some of the ferment _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_ from a flask of wort that had undergone fermentation, and\r\nsowed a scarcely perceptible quantity of it in another flask containing\r\na saline medium, composed as follows:—\r\n\r\n     Water containing about 10 per cent. of    150 c.c. (5-1/4 fl.\r\n     sugar-candy                                              oz.)\r\n\r\n     Ash of yeast                              0·5 gramme (8 grs.)\r\n\r\n     Ammonic bitartrate                        0·2   “    (3 grs.)\r\n\r\n     Ammonic sulphate                          0·2   ”    (3 grs.)\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following days the ferment began to develop,\r\nalthough with difficulty, the fermentation revealing itself by\r\ncollections of bubbles appearing here and there on the surface of the\r\nliquid. We left the flask undisturbed till the 25th of November\r\nfollowing. On that day we found a very white deposit of ferment covering\r\nthe yeast-ash that had not been taken into solution, and a ring of\r\naërobian ferment on a level with the surface of liquid; all the sugar\r\nhad disappeared; the liquid contained 5·2 per cent. of alcohol, by\r\nvolume, at a temperature of 15° C. (59° F.); and, lastly, in consequence\r\nof the purity of the materials employed, there was no trace of the\r\nformation of fungoid growths, whether of _mycoderma vini_ or of\r\n_mycoderma cerevisiæ_, on the surface of the liquid, or of vibrios or\r\nlactic-ferment below the surface.\r\n\r\nThus then we see—and several other examples throughout this work confirm\r\nthe fact—that saccharine liquids holding mineral salts in solution are\r\nas capable of complete fermentation as any media of natural composition.\r\nIt is true that ferment develops slowly and with difficulty in them, and\r\nat times takes on rather curious forms, but, nevertheless, it does\r\ndevelop in the media and carry on a fermentation in which not the\r\nminutest particle of sugar is left undecomposed. This is true, at least,\r\nin the case of _saccharomyces pastorianus_, but there are other ferments\r\nwhich in such media are checked in their multiplication and in their\r\ncontinued action on sugar. One condition indispensable to the\r\naccomplishment of fermentation in such a sweetened mineral medium, by\r\nmeans of _saccharomyces pastorianus_, is the absolute purity of the\r\nmaterials and of the ferment. It is necessary that the life and\r\nphysiological action of the latter should be in no way interfered with\r\nby the presence of other microscopic organisms. We shall have occasion\r\nto revert to this important detail in connection with our growths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\nFig. 49 represents the ferment as it appeared when examined on August\r\n11th, 1873. We can no longer recognize in it any _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_. The general appearance is spherical, and there are a\r\nnumber of clusters of budding cells which remind one at first sight of\r\nthe mode of germination of brewers’ “high” yeast. At _a_, _a_, _a_, we\r\nsee globules from which irregular abortive filaments have sprung, a\r\nproof of difficult germination. No such monstrosities could ever have\r\noccurred if we had used beer-wort or must as our nutritive medium.\r\n\r\nOn November 25th we made another examination and sketch of the ferment,\r\nthe appearance of which did not differ materially from that given above.\r\nThe general appearance was the same, consisting mostly of globules\r\njoined together in clusters of two or three or more. No separation, such\r\nas occurs in the case of ferment formed in natural worts, had taken\r\nplace. The ferment, moreover, was very irregular, and comprised cells of\r\nall sizes. We sowed some of it in a flask of pure wort. On November 26th\r\nthere was no apparent development: on November 27th, however, not more\r\nthan forty-eight hours after impregnation, there was a considerable\r\ndeposit of white ferment at the bottom of the liquid, and fermentation\r\nwas so active that the surface of the liquid was covered with an\r\nabundant froth. This shows us the wonderful vitality and recuperative\r\npower possessed by germs which, left to themselves for about four\r\nmonths, revived so readily. It proves too that the reviving influences\r\ntook effect on some aërobian ferment. From the mode of life of this\r\nlatter being similar to that of a surface fungoid growth, it does not\r\nbecome exhausted as the cells of ordinary ferment do. Now the cells\r\nwhich, sown on August 6th, had become exhausted by prolonged stay in the\r\nmineral liquid, and were almost inert, would have required several days\r\nfor their revival; but in the experiment described the revival was\r\nrapid, and this rapidity proves, as we have said, that the revival must\r\nhave taken place in cells of aërobian ferment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\nTaking some fresh yeast from the bottom of the liquid we examined and\r\nmade a sketch of it (Fig. 50). The field was filled with round and oval\r\ncells, jointed and ramified filaments, budding and multiplying in the\r\nmost remarkable manner, reminding us of the germination of the cells of\r\nyeast exhausted in sweetened water, and also of the germination in the\r\nform of _dematium pullulans_ of certain germ-cells which are spread over\r\nthe surface of sweet, domestic fruits. We could never grow tired, as we\r\nwrote it in our original notes, of sketching this beautiful plant, which\r\nestablishes very clearly a transition between one of the best defined\r\ncellular ferments, viz., _saccharomyces pastorianus_, and certain forms\r\nof very common fungoid growths, those of _dematium_, and even of the\r\nmost common mould, _mucor mucedo_ or _racemosus_, when it vegetates\r\nbeneath the surface of a liquid and acts as a ferment.[108] We have\r\nhere, as in these cases, filamentous chains branching into other similar\r\nchains, composed of more or less elongated cells, which at length fall\r\noff and germinate exactly as the conidia-bearing _hyphae_ of _mucor_ do.\r\n\r\nThe aërobian ferment of “high” yeast, in whatever medium we cultivated\r\nit, presented no peculiarity, as far as its forms were concerned. It was\r\ncomposed of cells of spherical shape, like ordinary “high” yeast, and\r\ngerminated in the same way as the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\nFig. 51 represents the revival of this aërobian ferment. We recognize\r\nhere the branched mode of budding and spherical contour characteristic\r\nof “high” yeast proper. Nor does the aërobian ferment of “low” yeast\r\npresent any special peculiarities, in forms, dimensions, and mode of\r\ngrowth closely resembling the “low” yeast from which it is derived. At\r\nthe commencement of its restoration, however, if this is performed in\r\nsweetened water, the cells in the groups are larger than those which are\r\nsubsequently developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\nFig. 52 represents the aërobian ferment of yeast used in\r\n“low”-fermentation breweries, examined forty-eight hours after pitching.\r\nWe find that groups resembling that at a are of very rare occurrence.\r\nThey are to be seen only at the very beginning, generally only for the\r\nfirst few hours of the renewed activity. Very soon, however, they\r\ndevelop cells which are of the size of the oval cells budding at _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nFig. 53 represents the aërobian caseous yeast which forms rather\r\nrapidly, in thick, greasy-looking pellicles, on the surface of liquids\r\nwhich have been fermented by means of caseous ferment. The larger form\r\nof cells, _a_ and _b_, is not often met with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nOn May 27th, 1875, we sowed, in a flask of wort, a trace of a pellicle\r\nof this kind, which had formed on the surface of a flask in which\r\nfermentation had been set up by means of caseous yeast in May of the\r\npreceding year. On May 30th fermentation began to reveal its presence by\r\na voluminous froth, and the newly-formed yeast had reached the bottom of\r\nthe flask. A small quantity was taken out by a capillary glass tube, and\r\na sketch of the ferment made; this is given in Fig. 54. Amongst the\r\ncells which occupy the field there are groups of some of larger size.\r\nThese are not distinct forms mixed with the others, but simply another\r\nillustration of the fact that old cells in course of revival, especially\r\nwhen they have been exhausted in sweetened water, as we have just\r\nobserved of the aërobian ferment of “low” yeast, commence with forms of\r\nlarger diameter or more elongated than the ordinary forms peculiar to\r\nthe ferment which at a later stage are developed from them. We have seen\r\nhow marked and exaggerated this feature was in the case of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_.\r\n\r\nLet us again call attention to the forms of aërobian ferment furnished\r\nby the yeast which we have already described under the name of _new\r\n“high” yeast_. Fig. 55 represents this aërobian ferment, as taken on\r\nNovember 27th, 1873, from a pellicle of rather greasy and moist\r\nappearance, on the surface of a flask of fermented beer-wort which had\r\nbeen impregnated on July 21st, 1872. It might readily be mistaken for\r\nordinary “high” yeast, yet no two ferments can be more distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\nOn November 27th, 1873, we sowed a trace of this ferment in a flask of\r\nwort. From the 29th, with a continuous temperature of 25° C. (77° F.), a\r\nconsiderable deposit of yeast began to form, and the froth of\r\nfermentation covered the whole surface of the liquid. We took a little\r\nof this deposit for examination; it is represented in Fig. 56. The field\r\nis occupied with oval cells of great uniformity. We recognize the aspect\r\nof the original yeast (Fig. 43). Here and there, indeed, we come across\r\nsome cells of larger size, such as those at _a_ and _b_, which is\r\nanother illustration of the remark that we have just made respecting the\r\nforms which revived exhausted cells take on at the commencement of a new\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\nThe physical aspect of the several aërobian ferments is in general so\r\ncharacteristic that we are often able by simple inspection to\r\ndistinguish between them as they occur on the surface of liquids.\r\n_Saccharomyces pastorianus_ in its aërobian state forms a crown of cells\r\nround the sides of the vessel at the surface of the liquid, which crown\r\nis broken up by the least agitation of the liquid; its vitality\r\ncontinues for years.\r\n\r\nThe aërobian ferment of “high” yeast appears in the form of small\r\nisolated teats on the surface of the fermented liquid. It develops\r\nrather sluggishly, and has no great vitality.\r\n\r\nThe aërobian form of “low” yeast develops as a somewhat fragile layer,\r\nthe least agitation precipitating it to the bottom of the vessel in a\r\ncloud of very small irregular flocks, that do not diffuse through the\r\nliquid as they fall. With free access to air it retains life for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe aërobian ferment of caseous yeast forms a continuous greasy-looking\r\npellicle, gradually thickening, which breaks up into fragments when\r\nshaken. With a supply of air it lives very long, and the pellicle\r\ngradually increases in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing these ferments we may naturally ask ourselves the question\r\nwhether the “high” ferments of which we have spoken—the industrial one\r\nconcerned in the “high” fermentation of breweries, and the other which\r\nwe have termed _new “high” ferment_—are not aërobian ferments of “low”\r\nyeasts. We are inclined to think that the ferment which in the preceding\r\nparagraph we termed _new “high” ferment_, may, perhaps, be the aërobian\r\nform of the “low” yeast employed by Alsatian and German brewers. We have\r\nstudied this new “high” ferment side by side with the aërobian ferment\r\nof “low” yeast, and the result we have arrived at is, that in appearance\r\nand mode of germination, as well as in the flavour and quality of the\r\nbeers which they produce, they greatly resemble one another. In the last\r\nrespect, however, we cannot say that the identity is quite absolute, and\r\nhence it is with some doubt that we suggest the possible identity of the\r\ntwo ferments. As regards the ordinary “high” yeast of breweries, it may\r\nwell be supposed, both from its power of rising to the surface during\r\nfermentation and from the peculiar smell and flavour of its beer, that\r\nwe have in it the aërobian ferment of some “low” yeast, as to the\r\nidentity of which, however, we can say nothing, having no knowledge as\r\nto where it is to be found; or, indeed, any certainty that such a yeast\r\nactually exists.\r\n\r\nIn writing these lines an idea suggests itself which might be profitably\r\nmade the subject of serious experimental study. What would be the\r\npeculiar properties of the aërobious ferment-form of an aërobian yeast?\r\nCertain facts incline us to believe that these forms differ from each\r\nother just as a “low” yeast differs from its aërobian ferment. If this\r\nwere actually the case it would be very interesting to compare the\r\npeculiar properties of an indefinite series of aërobian ferments, all\r\nderived from a common origin. We find recorded in our laboratory notes\r\nthat a certain aërobian ferment of the second generation produced a beer\r\ndifferent from that produced by the same ferment of the first\r\ngeneration, being possessed of a fragrance so marked that, on entering\r\nour laboratory, in which only a few litres of this beer were fermenting,\r\nwe were at once struck by the powerful odour which it emitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n              § VI.—The Purification of Commercial Yeasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the researches detailed in the preceding\r\nchapter require for their successful prosecution that the ferments on\r\nwhich we experiment should be absolutely free from germs of other\r\norganisms, and we have shown how impossible it would be, if this\r\ncondition were not complied with, to follow for weeks or months,\r\nsometimes even years, the changes which occur in a yeast maintained in\r\ncontact with air, either in sweetened water or in a liquid which has\r\nfermented under its influence. Equally necessary is it that the\r\nsaccharine worts employed should also be exempt from these impurities,\r\nas well as the air, which is being constantly renewed at the surface of\r\nthe liquids. These last conditions may be realized by the adoption of\r\nour double-necked flasks, with which a laboratory for research of this\r\nkind should be furnished, always ready for use, filled with the\r\ndifferent kinds of liquids that may be required.\r\n\r\nIn general, the inconveniences resulting from the impurity of a yeast\r\nemployed do not immediately manifest themselves, in consequence of the\r\nenormous preponderance of the true yeast, which, in comparison with the\r\nforeign germs that contaminate it, may be so great that microscopical\r\nexamination fails to reveal even the presence of these latter. Again, it\r\nis a well-known fact that the abundance of one growth in a limited\r\nmedium operates to the prejudice of a less abundant one, inasmuch as the\r\nfirst consumes the nutritive materials at the expense of the second, and\r\nmore particularly the needful amount of oxygen. It follows, that when a\r\nsaccharine liquid is impregnated with commercial yeast, nothing but\r\nyeast may be detected for a time, and one is led to believe in the\r\npurity of the subsequent growth. This, however, supposes that the\r\nexternal conditions, as well as those of the medium of growth, are\r\nequally adapted to the life of the yeast and that of those organisms\r\npresent as impurities; for if these conditions rather favoured the\r\nnutrition of the latter, we should be sure to find their proper\r\ndevelopments appearing at an early stage. For example, when the growth\r\nof yeast becomes sluggish, we have invariably the development of such\r\nafter-growths. The principal germs, having exhausted the saccharine\r\nliquid which has fermented under their influence and is no longer\r\nadapted for their growth, cease to develop, and have their place taken\r\nby ferments of disease, spores of moulds, mycodermata, &c., the growth\r\nof which proceeds more or less rapidly, in proportion as the character\r\nof the liquid and the surrounding temperature are more or less suited to\r\ntheir growth.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we have an explanation of the rapid change that occurs in\r\nbrewers’ yeast when left to itself after fermentation. In such a mass of\r\ncells, kept apart from any food-supply, and only with difficulty able to\r\nkeep themselves in life by consuming their own soluble contents, we have\r\nan excellent field for the development of foreign germs. In this way we\r\nmay have a rapid putrefaction in yeast, to which there will be a\r\ncorrespondingly rapid growth of organisms in the liquid, where they\r\nfind, as well as in the yeast-cells, appropriate nourishment. Nothing\r\ncould better confirm this view of the matter than the array of facts, by\r\nway of antithesis, already described, in which we have seen a pure yeast\r\nremain for an indefinite time in contact with pure air, without\r\nundergoing any putrefaction, or manifesting other changes than those\r\nwhich result from the combustions peculiar to living cells when left to\r\nsupport themselves, in a moist state, in contact with oxygen.\r\n\r\nIn the process of brewing, as soon as fermentation is finished, or\r\nrather, as soon as certain physical effects are produced, for instance,\r\nwhen the beer falls bright, or, as the French say technically, when the\r\nyeast breaks up,[109] the beer is racked; subsequently the yeast, which\r\nis left in a plastic layer at the bottom of the vessels, is collected,\r\nwashed, and kept under water in a cool place, to be used again in the\r\ncourse of twenty-four or forty-eight hours. Brewers never care to keep\r\ntheir yeast for a longer time before using it, especially in summer. We\r\ncan understand how this practice prevents the foreign germs which are\r\nmixed with the yeast from living and reproducing; but although the\r\nconditions of brewing, as far as the treatment of the yeast is\r\nconcerned, may, in a certain measure, prevent the development of these\r\ngerms of disease, nevertheless they are there, and from their extreme\r\nminuteness, pass into the beer in greater or less number, however bright\r\nit may have been rendered by racking. There they only await conditions\r\nfavourable to their existence to enable them to develop, and to affect\r\nmore or less injuriously the qualities of that delicate beverage.\r\n\r\nOn December 15th, 1872, we bought nine samples of beer in different\r\nlarge cafés in Paris, which had all come from the best breweries of\r\nStrasburg, Nancy, Vienna, and Burton. After leaving them for twenty-four\r\nhours, we decanted all our samples, and then sowed a drop of the deposit\r\nof each in flasks of pure wort. On January 2nd, 1873, we examined the\r\nferments formed in these worts, which had been kept in an oven at a\r\ntemperature of 20° C. (68° F.), and also tasted the beers produced; they\r\nall had an abominable taste, and each contained diseased ferments.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, by way of comparison, we impregnated other flasks of\r\nwort with pure ferments. None of the beers of this series acquired a bad\r\ntaste or produced foreign ferments; they only became flat.\r\n\r\nWhen we review the operations of the brewer’s art, we are surprised by\r\nthe comparative perfection to which that art has been brought by the\r\nlaborious experience of years, and the more so when we consider that, as\r\nregards the question of the diseases of beer, the brewer has never been\r\nguided by any such rigorous principles as those which we have explained\r\nin this work. We have already given proofs of this in our first chapter.\r\n\r\nThe beer is racked and separated from its yeast before fermentation has\r\nentirely ceased. The principal reason for this is that it is necessary\r\nthat the beer, after being run into cask, should work again and undergo\r\na secondary fermentation, in order that it may not be invaded by the\r\nparasites, of which we have already spoken, as would not fail to be the\r\ncase if the beer were suffered to remain in a state of perfect\r\nquiescence. Not only is the beer racked before it has attained its limit\r\nof attenuation, but in addition to this, and also with the view of\r\nchecking the development of parasites, it is placed in cellars sensibly\r\ncooler than the temperature of fermentation, low as that is in the case\r\nof “low” beers: the temperature of the cellars being not higher than 2°\r\nor 3° C. (36° F.).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the requirements of trade prevent our complying with\r\nthese exigencies to the end. When the beer is sold it is conveyed away,\r\nno matter what the season may be, and deposited in the retailer’s\r\ncellar, for a longer or shorter time, according to the variations of\r\nconsumption. On a warm day beer will be in great demand; the next day,\r\nif rain or cold have come on, the demand will be very limited, since\r\nbeer is, in our climate at least, a drink for hot weather. From causes\r\nof this nature, the beer may have to remain a long time in the cellars\r\nof the retailers or consumers. By way of precaution, indeed, it is put\r\ninto very small casks, which permit of a frequent renewal of the supply,\r\nand is conveyed to distances by express trains, and during the night; it\r\nis even sent away in wagons provided with a kind of double case, the\r\nouter jacket being filled with ice, which keeps the air surrounding the\r\ncasks constantly cold. Such are some of the troublesome measures taken\r\nto obviate the danger that we have pointed out. They operate very\r\ninjuriously in restricting the trade and raising the price of beer. It\r\nis a matter of extreme importance, then, that our produce should be\r\nbetter removed from the action of those microscopic enemies which beer\r\ncontains; in other words, that this beverage should have less cause to\r\nfear circumstances favourable to the development of the germs of\r\nimpurity with which it is always contaminated, as a natural consequence\r\nof the methods of manufacture at present adopted. The question of\r\nalteration in the flavour of beer should be regarded from another point\r\nof view which merits equal attention. We have seen that there are\r\ndifferent kinds of beer, each of which corresponds to a special ferment\r\nfrom which it derives its flavour and aroma, and, in a word, everything\r\nwhich gives it a value in the eyes of the consumer. It very often\r\nhappens, especially in badly-managed breweries, and more particularly in\r\nthose in which several beers are manufactured, that the yeast is a\r\nmixture of different ferments. The evil effects of such a mixture are\r\nexperienced in the course of manufacture, and still more so in the beer\r\nafter manufacture. Brewers in good “low” fermentation breweries, who\r\nbrew what is called _stock_ beer, during the winter months, for\r\nconsumption in summer, up to August and September, are very anxious to\r\nprevent the development of a _vinous_ flavour in beers of this kind.\r\nAccording to our observations, this vinous flavour seems to be\r\nprincipally due to an intermixture with the pitching yeast of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_ or its varieties, one of the peculiarities\r\nof which ferment is that in the course of time it imparts a decided\r\nvinous flavour to beer. If this ferment were not present amongst the\r\nyeast-cells—and here we are speaking of an absolute, so to say,\r\nmathematically absolute absence—the beer produced would gradually grow\r\nold in the store cellars, without ever acquiring any vinous flavour,\r\nproperly so called.\r\n\r\nThis vinous flavour develops more especially in English beers when these\r\nare kept. It is an easy matter to show that in English beers, after\r\ntheir manufacture, _saccharomyces pastorianus_ and the ferment which we\r\nhave termed _caseous_, which also imparts a peculiar flavour, form\r\nalmost exclusively, notwithstanding the fact that the yeast used in the\r\nmanufacture of English beer is a ferment essentially distinct from\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_.\r\n\r\nThe secondary fermentation which takes place in “high” and “low” beers\r\nstored in cask after manufacture, is very often due to this same\r\nferment, which may be recognized by elongated jointed cells, at times\r\nmore or less ramified, as well as by the influence which it exercises\r\nupon the flavour of the beer.\r\n\r\nWe may add that the general result of our researches has convinced us\r\nthat “high” yeast cannot transform itself, any more than “low” yeast\r\ncan, into the ferment of which we are speaking, and that whenever a beer\r\nproduced by means of “high” or “low” yeast develops a foreign ferment,\r\nthis ferment must have existed in the original yeast in the form of\r\ngerms, which, from their extreme scarcity, often fail to be detected by\r\nmeans of the microscope. The best proof that we can give of this is the\r\nfact that a beer produced by means of “high” or “low” yeast, if left to\r\nitself for months or years, will never contain in its deposit anything\r\nbesides the yeast that was used in its manufacture, provided that that\r\nwas pure to begin with. Now this can never be the case in dealing with\r\nactual commercial beers, no matter what they may be or in what brewery\r\nthey may be produced. In all beers, in the course of time, in addition\r\nto diseased ferments, ferments essentially different from those used in\r\ntheir manufacture will appear, and notably _saccharomyces pastorianus_;\r\nthis result must be attributed to the general impurity of commercial\r\nyeasts.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the intermixture of ferments is to be feared almost as\r\nmuch as the presence of diseased ferments, when these latter have not\r\ndeveloped to any great extent. We have often seen our fermentations\r\ninvaded by ferments differing absolutely from those which we originally\r\nemployed. The repetition of growths, and more particularly changes in\r\nthe composition of our fermentable media, purposely made with the view\r\nof attaining certain results, often produce complications of this kind.\r\nFor a long time we were unable to realize the true significance of the\r\nresults of some of our experiments, in consequence of the facts which we\r\nhave just explained, as well as those detailed in the preceding\r\nparagraph, having escaped our notice; indeed, our ignorance of those\r\nfacts added greatly to the difficulty and length of our researches. Our\r\nlabours from the commencement of this work to the date of its\r\npublication have extended over not less than five years, and no one can\r\nknow better than ourselves with what advantage we might devote a still\r\nlonger time to it; but, as Lavoisier says, one would never give anything\r\nto the world if he delayed doing so until he fully attained unto his\r\nideal aims, which always seem more distant the more one increases one’s\r\nefforts in the attempt.\r\n\r\nOur preceding observations show how extremely important it is to employ\r\npure yeasts to obtain, on the one hand, well flavoured beers, whilst\r\nadhering to the processes at present existing in breweries, and on the\r\nother, beers of good keeping qualities, less liable to injury, less\r\ndependent on actual commercial requirements, capable, that is, of\r\nwithstanding conditions favourable to the development of ferments\r\nprejudicial to the soundness of the produce, what we have named ferments\r\nof disease.\r\n\r\nIn the case of intermixture of alcoholic ferments, we may sometimes\r\nmanage to effect their separation by taking advantage of their unequal\r\nvitalities in different media of cultivation. On December 17th, 1872, we\r\nmade a powder of commercial Dutch yeast and plaster, as described in\r\nChapter III. § 6. The Dutch yeast was a “high” ferment.\r\n\r\nOn July 25th, 1873, we sowed a portion of this dried mixture in a flask\r\nof pure wort. From July 27th patches of bubbles from fermentation were\r\nvisible on the surface.\r\n\r\nOn August 2nd the fermentation was completed. The yeast, examined under\r\nthe microscope, was _apparently_ pure, formed of spherical cells of a\r\nfine “high” ferment. We poured away the fermented liquid, observing\r\nevery necessary precaution, and left in the flask almost all the deposit\r\nof yeast, and not more than one or two cubic centimetres (about half a\r\ntea-spoonful) of beer.\r\n\r\nOn November 15th following the yeast, examined afresh, still seemed pure\r\nand still exhibited the form of round cells of “high” yeast, only that\r\nthey had taken on a very aged aspect, showing a double contour, and\r\nfilled with granulations collected irregularly about the centre. Such\r\nare the precise characteristics of dead cells; nevertheless it was still\r\npossible that some living cells yet remained. To assure ourselves of\r\nthis we took some of the yeast and placed it in a flask of pure wort. On\r\nthe 19th a little froth from fermentative action appeared on the\r\nsurface. We then examined the yeast and discovered that it was no longer\r\n“high” yeast, but a small ferment of rather irregular appearance, in\r\nwhich the jointed cells of _saccharomyces pastorianus_, as it usually\r\nappears after a succession of growths, predominated. It must not be\r\nimagined here that what we saw was a transformation of one yeast into\r\nanother. The phenomena are to be explained much more simply. The Dutch\r\nyeast employed being very impure must have contained traces of foreign\r\nferments, especially of _saccharomyces pastorianus_. Reduced to a dry\r\npowder on December 17th, 1872, the two or more varieties of cells\r\ncomprising it had preserved their vitality in consequence of the\r\nplaster, and this vitality had continued at all events until July 25th,\r\n1873. Subsequently, when cultivated in wort, they had multiplied in that\r\nmedium. The _saccharomyces_ had revived like the rest, but its quantity,\r\ncompared with the high Dutch yeast, was so small that the microscopical\r\nobservations made on August 2nd, when the flask was decanted, failed to\r\ndiscover its presence. Between August 2nd and November 15th the high\r\nyeast must have perished entirely: the cells of _saccharomyces_, on the\r\ncontrary, still maintained their vitality, and these alone multiplied in\r\nthe flask of wort impregnated on November 15th. Here we have an example\r\nof the separation of alcoholic ferments, through the unequal resistance\r\nthey sometimes offer to adverse conditions to which they may be\r\nsubjected. We may also conclude that if we had prepared a quantity of\r\nbeer with the “high” yeast, which in our experiment of August 2nd, 1873,\r\nseemed to have developed in a state of entire purity, this beer when\r\nmade and stored in cask or bottle could not have failed to undergo a\r\nsecondary fermentation, in consequence of a development of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_.\r\n\r\nLet us take, as another example of purification of the same kind, the\r\ncase of the different ferments of the vintage. When must begins to\r\nferment the apiculated ferment invariably appears, and becomes\r\nafterwards associated, more or less, with the _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_, in the presence of which the multiplication of the\r\napiculated ferment soon ceases. _Saccharomyces pastorianus_, in its\r\nturn, is gradually displaced by the ferment which we have termed the\r\nordinary ferment of wine, and which Dr. Rees has named _saccharomyces\r\nellipsoïdeus_. On the subject of these changes in the proportion of the\r\nferments of wine, the Note which we published in 1862 in the _Bulletin\r\nde la Société chimique_ may be consulted. Now, these various ferments\r\nmutually interfere with each other: whereas if _saccharomyces\r\napiculatus_ were there alone it would multiply to a greater extent, and\r\nwith greater advantage to the fermentation of the must. This result is\r\nobtained by filtering the must, as we have already observed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what we have just said that the principal part of the\r\ndeposits of yeast in the sediment of fermented grapes, at the time when\r\nthe wine is first racked, which in the Jura, is called _l’entonnaison_,\r\nis composed of the ordinary ferment of wine, the _saccharomyces\r\nellipsoïdeus_, and that the cells of apiculated ferment are scarcely\r\ndiscoverable with the microscope, being scattered amongst an infinite\r\nmultitude of other ferments.[110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nWe procured from Arbois, on January 20th, 1875, some wine yeast taken\r\nfrom a large barrel of the preceding vintage, racked on January 18th.\r\nThe ferment was very irregular. Some of its cells were very old, of a\r\nyellowish colour, and full of granulations—amongst these a certain\r\nnumber formed jointed segments, rather elongated, and probably belonging\r\nto _saccharomyces pastorianus_. The other cells were transparent, and\r\napparently still young. This mixture of the two ferments is represented\r\nin Fig. 57. No doubt if we had searched carefully we should also have\r\nfound some cells of _saccharomyces apiculatus_. On January 21st we sowed\r\na small quantity of this raw yeast in a flask of sweetened water. On the\r\n24th we poured off the liquid, and supplied the deposit with fresh\r\nsweetened water. The exterior temperature was 12° C. (54° F.). On the\r\n27th we took some of the deposit and put it into a flask of wort. The\r\nfollowing days there was a development of yeast, accompanied by\r\nfermentation. We obtained, however, neither the large forms of the\r\nferments of fruits, nor those of the more minute ferments represented in\r\nPlate XI. The _saccharomyces pastorianus_, represented in the yeast\r\nwhich we sowed by aged, granular, elongated cells, had, therefore, not\r\nrevived. Fearing that this result might have been attributable to\r\ninsufficiency of the exhaustion, which had only lasted for a few days,\r\nwe raised the temperature of the flask of sweetened water to 25° C. (77°\r\nF.), at which we kept it until February 20th. On that day we sowed some\r\nof this yeast in wort. There was a very perceptible revival the next\r\nday, but it was still impossible to detect with the microscope the forms\r\nwe have just mentioned, nor did _saccharomyces pastorianus_ appear in\r\nfresh, succeeding growths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nFig. 58 represents the yeast formed, which evidently had sprung from the\r\ntransparent cells seen in Fig. 57, and doubtless belonging to the\r\nordinary ferment of wine, _saccharomyces ellipsoïdeus_. Here we have\r\nanother example of the natural separation of ferments brought about by\r\nthe death of one or two of them, or by extreme differences in the time\r\nof their revival.\r\n\r\nWe cultivated this yeast (Fig. 58), to some considerable extent, in\r\nbeer-wort. It produced a peculiar beer, of vinous character, in fact a\r\ntrue _barley wine_. This proves, we may here remark, that ordinary wine,\r\nin its flavour and quality, depends to a great extent on the specific\r\nnature of the ferments which develop during the fermentation of the\r\nvintage; and we may fairly assume that if we were to subject the same\r\nmust to the action of different ferments we should obtain wines of\r\ndifferent characters. With a view to the practical application of this\r\nidea, it would be well to undertake new studies in this direction; and\r\nthe methods of cultivating and managing ferments, explained in this\r\nwork, would be of great value in such researches.\r\n\r\nThe purification of ferments may be accomplished by various methods,\r\naccording as we have to deal with an intermixture of ferments, or to\r\nregard as our principal object the expulsion of ferments of disease,\r\nsuch as vibrio germs, lactic ferment, the filamentous ferment of turned\r\nbeer, _mycoderma aceti_ or _mycoderma vini_.\r\n\r\nOne method of easy application consists in sowing the yeast in water\r\nsweetened with 10 per cent. of sugar. This liquid should be first\r\nboiled, and preserved in the two-necked flasks which we have so often\r\ndescribed. Sweetened water is a very exhaustive medium for ferments, and\r\nthe organisms mixed with them. A great many cells perish in it, and the\r\nchances are that the foreign germs, which are always scarce in\r\ncomparison with the great number of cells of ferment, may be amongst\r\nthose which die, or those which become so exhausted that when the yeast,\r\nafter this treatment, is sown in wort, they disappear, and allow those\r\ncells which have remained vigorous enough to develop alone. The addition\r\nof a little tartaric acid to the saccharine solution—say, from 1/1000 to\r\n2/1000 part by weight—often facilitates the destruction of certain germs\r\nof impurity. _Mycoderma aceti_ and _mycoderma vini_ do not find suitable\r\nlife-conditions in the sweetened water; they soon disappear if\r\ncultivated alternately in sweetened water and wort.\r\n\r\nIn the place of flasks we may make use simply of shallow basins, covered\r\nwith sheets of glass, such as we have already had occasion to describe,\r\nfor cultivating yeast in wort after it has been for a longer or shorter\r\ntime in the sweetened water. The success of these methods of\r\npurification is mainly due to the fact that wort is highly aerated, and\r\nexperience shows that the principal disease-ferments of beer are as much\r\nchecked in their development by the presence of air as they are favoured\r\nby its absence, the inverse of which holds good in the case of alcoholic\r\nferments. So true is this that, working with commercial yeast, which is\r\ninvariably impure, it would be impossible in our opinion to make beer in\r\nclosed vessels; and, indeed, as a matter of fact, one has never\r\nsucceeded in doing this, although the attempt has often been made. To do\r\nso requires, much more than in methods actually in use, the employment\r\nof pure yeast.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, this advantage in cultivating yeasts in shallow\r\nbasins, that the multiplication of the alcoholic ferments is promoted,\r\nand that of most of the disease-ferments is checked. There is an\r\nexception, indeed, in the case of mycodermata; but of all\r\ndisease-ferments these are the most easily got rid of, by repeating our\r\ngrowths before they make their appearance. Notwithstanding this, our\r\ntwo-necked flasks, which also contain much air at first, are to be\r\npreferred to the shallow basins, inasmuch as they are a perfect\r\nsafeguard against the germs floating in the surrounding air, as well as\r\nthose of the ferment _saccharomyces pastorianus_.\r\n\r\nAnother method is suggested to us by the curious results of which we\r\nhave already spoken, obtained by sowing yeasts in a wort rendered acid\r\nand alcoholic by the addition of bi-tartrate of potash and alcohol.\r\nExperience proves that many disease-ferments find great difficulty in\r\nwithstanding a succession of growths in wort to which 1-½ per cent. of\r\ntartaric acid and from 2 to 3 per cent. of alcohol have been added. Such\r\na mixture, however, is equally well adapted to the requirements of\r\n_saccharomyces pastorianus_, and we must always assure ourselves that\r\nthis organism has not taken the place of the yeast we are endeavouring\r\nto purify. Growths at a very low temperature are of great help in\r\nenabling us to get rid of all ferments that are foreign to “low” yeast,\r\nand should be resorted to in all cases where this yeast is to be\r\npurified.\r\n\r\nAnother method of purification, which is perhaps quicker, although\r\ninferior in other respects, consists in the employment of carbolic\r\nacid—that is to say, in purifying our yeast by successive growths, we\r\nmay add to every 100 c.c. (3-½ fluid ounces) of wort that we employ from\r\nten to twelve drops of phenol water, containing 10 per cent. of the\r\nacid. The action of the phenol, which at first is invariably combined\r\nwith that of the oxygen of the air, tends to destroy the vitality of\r\nmany of the cells sown, involving to some extent also the yeast which we\r\nare interested in preserving. But amongst the number of cells that are\r\naffected those which are less abundant, that is to say, those which are\r\npresent as impurities, are paralyzed relatively in much greater\r\nproportion. If the acid does not destroy them it greatly checks their\r\ndevelopment, and the cells of yeast, which multiply continuously in vast\r\nnumbers (for the fermentation goes on in spite of the phenol, if this is\r\nadded in small quantity), gradually choke the foreign germs in a\r\nsuccession of growths.\r\n\r\nBy these different means, which are employed separately or combined with\r\none another, we generally manage to obtain the yeast which we wish to\r\npurify in a very pure state. We need scarcely add that it is always\r\nwell, in the case of our purifications, to begin with specimens which\r\nare already as pure as it is possible to obtain them. In making our\r\nchoice the microscope is our best guide, but it is not a sufficient one.\r\nWe should be strangely deceived if we believed in the purity of a yeast\r\nfor the sole reason that when examined under the microscope it appeared\r\nto contain nothing of a foreign nature. The best means of assuring\r\nourselves of the purity of a yeast consists in making some beer in one\r\nof our two-necked flasks, and leaving this flask, after fermentation, in\r\nan oven at a temperature of 20° or 25° C. (68° to 77° F.). If the beer,\r\nin the course of a few weeks, does not thicken, or become covered with\r\nefflorescence, if its deposit is microscopically pure, if, in short, it\r\nonly tastes flat, we may have every confidence in the purity of the\r\nyeast which produced it. After we have purified a yeast we are,\r\nunfortunately, never sure that it has not undergone some change in the\r\ncourse of the manipulations to which it has been subjected in\r\npurification. It is indispensable, therefore, that we should test it,\r\nand see if the flavour of the beer produced by it is really the one that\r\nwe want—viz., that of the beer from which we took the yeast that we\r\nsubmitted to purification.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a series of practical experiments that we were carrying\r\nout in the large brewery of Tourtel, at Tantonville, in 1875, in\r\nconnection with the new process of brewing, which will be explained in\r\nChap. VII., the following circumstance occurred. We had purified some of\r\nthe yeast of the brewery, by means of a succession of growths and adding\r\na few drops of phenol, and had obtained a yeast of irreproachable\r\npurity. It happened that this yeast, which was repeatedly cultivated in\r\nthe brewery during the summer of 1875, from six to ten hectolitres (130\r\nto 220 gallons) of wort being used on each occasion, always produced a\r\nbeer that had a yeast-bitten flavour and defective clarifying powers,\r\nnotwithstanding that it possessed remarkable keeping properties, which\r\nit owed to the pureness of the ferment employed. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe beer suffered no injury from journeys of more than 300 miles, by\r\nslow trains, in ordinary casks, containing from 50 to 100 litres (10 to\r\n20 gallons), during the great heats of June and July, or from being\r\nsubsequently stored for two months in a cellar, the temperature of which\r\nrose during that time from 12° to 18° C. (54° to 65° F.). The\r\ntemperature of fermentation had been 13° C. (55° F.). Beer from the same\r\nbrewery, made with the same wort by the ordinary process, did not remain\r\nsound for three weeks in this same cellar.\r\n\r\nTo what may we attribute the peculiarity of the beer as just described?\r\nIt is probable that during our processes of purification some ferment\r\nhad taken the place of the principal yeast. Commercial yeasts, even\r\nthose with which the brewer is thoroughly satisfied, generally contain\r\nvarious ferments, which are maintained in their relative proportions, or\r\nvery nearly so, by the uniform conditions under which work is carried on\r\nin a brewery; but these proportions, it is obvious, might be very\r\nseriously affected by any radical change in the conditions of growth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  Extract from a Note which I inserted in 1862 in the _Bulletin de la\r\n  Société chimique_ of Paris.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Schützenberger, in his work on “Fermentation,” following Dr. de\r\n  Vauréal.

This\r\n  appears to be the only reference to this subject in the English\r\n  copy.—D. C. R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  The principal result of Dr. Rees’ labours consists in the discovery of\r\n  a sporulation peculiar to yeast cells, that is to say, to a formation\r\n  in the interior of these cells, and under particular conditions—such\r\n  as when the growth occurs on slices of cooked potatoes, carrots,\r\n  &c.—of two, three, or four smaller cells, which, when placed in\r\n  fermentable liquids, act like the germinating spores of ferments. The\r\n  mother-cell may be regarded as an _ascus_, and the daughter-cells as\r\n  _ascospores_, and so the genus _saccharomyces_ may be classified among\r\n  the group of fungi termed _ascomycetes_. These facts have been\r\n  frequently confirmed, notably by Dr. Engel, professor of the Faculty\r\n  of Medicine, at Nancy. Previously to Dr. Rees’ discovery, M. de Seynes\r\n  (_Comptes rendus_, t. lxvii., 1868) had described an endogenous\r\n  formation of spores in _mycoderma vini_, particularly in the elongated\r\n  cells, followed by the rupture of the mother-cell, and subsequent\r\n  absorption of cell-walls and other contents after the issue of the\r\n  endospores, which we have just termed _ascospores_. We ourselves had\r\n  also previously called attention to those refractive corpuscles which\r\n  appear amongst vibrios as probably being reproductive corpuscles, and\r\n  we had likewise witnessed the reabsorption of the parts surrounding\r\n  them. The plate on page 228 of our “Studies on the Silkworm Disease”\r\n  represents the phenomena in question.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  See _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, vol. lviii. p. 144.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  The plates referred to in this paragraph were exhibited at a meeting\r\n  of the Academy of Sciences, November 18, 1872, and commented upon by\r\n  the perpetual secretary, M. Dumas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  For these observations, we employed small glass cells, which we made\r\n  out of some St. Gobain glass by punching holes through it, and then\r\n  cementing on one side one of the little glasses used for covering\r\n  objects in microscopical examinations. In this manner we made small\r\n  troughs, in which we placed some wort that had been boiled, and a drop\r\n  of the water in which grapes had been washed. To prevent evaporation\r\n  we covered the cells with a sheet of glass. We examined the liquid in\r\n  these cells by inclining our microscope to the angle required.[88]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n  We also made use of cells similar to those employed by MM. Van Tieghem\r\n  and Lemonnier[89] in their researches on _mucorines_ (Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n  An apparatus similar to that employed by M. Duclaux in 1853[90] would\r\n  do equally well. We should be able to work with even greater facility\r\n  if we employed bulbs like some which we ordered in Germany, some\r\n  twelve years ago, of the well-known glass-blower, Geissler. We have\r\n  heard that these bulbs now sold by that maker are much used by German\r\n  microscopists. They consist of a tube blown out into a flat bulb, the\r\n  sides of which, in the centre, come sufficiently close together to\r\n  enclose but a very thin layer of liquid, and to admit of microscopical\r\n  examination. We may fill these tube-bulbs completely with liquid, to\r\n  the exclusion of air or we may surround the central drop with air.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  In our essay on acetic fermentation, published in 1864, we have\r\n  already described this apparatus, which we employed to follow the\r\n  multiplication of the jointed filaments of _mycoderma aceti_. See\r\n  PASTEUR, _Etudes sur le vinaigre_, p. 64, Paris, 1868.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  VAN TIEGHEM and LEMONNIER, _Annales des Sciences naturelles_, 5th\r\n  series, _Botanique_, t. xvii. 1873.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  DUCLAUX, _Comptes rendus des séances de l’Académie des Sciences_, t.\r\n  lvi. p. 1225.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  In experiments of this kind there is always a slight increase in the\r\n  volume of air in the jar. This increase may be very perceptible even\r\n  when the experiment made with fresh grapes, in August, for instance,\r\n  causes no fermentation due to the action of yeast. After the oxygen of\r\n  the air has been absorbed and replaced by carbonic acid gas, either by\r\n  direct oxidation or by the action of moulds, the grapes, although\r\n  crushed, act like fruits plunged into carbonic acid gas[92], and this\r\n  effect is even more marked in the case of imperfectly crushed grapes.\r\n  The reason is, that the crushing is never so perfect as to injure all\r\n  the cells of the parenchyma. We may easily convince ourselves that the\r\n  experiment on the liberation of carbonic acid gas and the formation of\r\n  alcohol by grapes and fruits in general when plunged into carbonic\r\n  acid succeeds very well in the case of fragments of fruits or grapes,\r\n  and succeeds better the less the parts are crushed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  See paragraph: Fermentation in saccharine fruits immersed in carbonic\r\n  acid gas, Chap. vi, § 2, p. 266.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rees has given the name _saccharomyces ellipsoideus_ to the\r\n  ferment of wine represented in Plates VIII. to XI. of our “Studies on\r\n  Wine,” which we have termed the ordinary ferment of wine, from its\r\n  being the most abundant of the ferments found at the end of the\r\n  fermentation that produces the wine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  The alcoholic ferments in general, subjected to these weakening\r\n  influences, have not all the same power of resistance. That one which\r\n  seems to possess this power in the highest degree is the\r\n  _saccharomyces pastorianus_, which ferment we had in view in writing\r\n  the above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  The term _exhaustion_ (_épuisement_), which we have just used, was,\r\n  perhaps, not altogether felicitously chosen. No doubt we exhaust the\r\n  cells of yeast when we sow an imponderable weight of them in a large\r\n  quantity of sweetened water; it might, however, be better to say that\r\n  in such a case we adopt a particular method of preserving the vitality\r\n  of the cells, without suffering them to die of exhaustion, or to\r\n  multiply by budding. We may remark that the yeast, in this case,\r\n  exists in a state of latent life, which resembles that of cells on the\r\n  surface of fruit. The cells on the surface of fruits, bunches, or\r\n  barks, can no more find around them sufficient aliment for their\r\n  propagation than can our yeast-cells in a great excess of sweetened\r\n  water. We would not, however, say of the spores on the surface of\r\n  fruits, or their woods, that they are in a state of exhaustion; the\r\n  term would be misapplied.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  See foot note p. 79.—D. C. R.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  M. Béchamp (_Comptes rendus_, November 18th, 1872) asserts that _the\r\n  air has no direct influence on the production of ferment or on the\r\n  process of alcoholic fermentation_. That experienced chemist deduces\r\n  this erroneous assertion from experiments on sweetened water, to which\r\n  bunches of grapes, petals of corn-poppies and petals of _robinia\r\n  pseudo-acacia_ had been added. As may be seen in our “Studies on Wine”\r\n  (p. 7, 1st edition, 1866), these experiments conducted by M. Béchamp\r\n  in 1872 were merely a reproduction of those made long before with vine\r\n  leaves, petals of elder-flowers, leaves of sorrel, &c., by the Marquis\r\n  de Bullion, Fabroni, and other experimentalists. M. Béchamp has\r\n  modified his later experiments by not adding the bunches of grapes,\r\n  leaves, &c., to the sweetened water before having introduced carbonic\r\n  acid gas into the liquid. Fermentation having still taken place in\r\n  spite of this change, M. Béchamp wrongly concluded that _air has no\r\n  direct influence on the production of yeast on an alcoholic\r\n  fermentation_. The introduction of the carbonic acid gas could not\r\n  remove all the air imparted to the sweetened water by the objects\r\n  placed in it, and it was this air which remained adhering to these\r\n  objects that permitted the production of fermentation. We may avail\r\n  ourselves of the opportunity here presented to add that, in this same\r\n  Note of November, 1872, M. Béchamp commences by making various\r\n  assertions concerning the forms assumed by cells of the alcoholic\r\n  ferment of the grape when in process of fermentation. This question\r\n  was discussed by us ten years before, and our conclusions supported by\r\n  sketches, in a Note which appeared in the _Bulletin de la Société\r\n  chimique de Paris_, for 1862.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  The germs of ferments are less widely diffused than M. de Bary\r\n  supposes, as may be seen from our observations in Chap. III. See, too,\r\n  our Memoir of 1862, _Sur les Générations dites Spontanées_, p. 49. It\r\n  is only in a laboratory devoted to researches on fermentation, or\r\n  places such as vaults, cellars, and breweries, that the air holds\r\n  appreciably in suspension cells of ferments, ready to germinate in\r\n  saccharine media. If we except these particular circumstances, ferment\r\n  is not very largely diffused, save on the surface of fruits and the\r\n  wood of the trees which bear them, and perhaps, also, on some other\r\n  plants. The particles of dust held in suspension in any atmosphere\r\n  whatever rarely produce fermentation in pure must even when we take\r\n  all possible precautions, so that the action be not overlooked; for\r\n  true fermentation may be hidden by fungoid growths, when there is much\r\n  air and but a small quantity of saccharine liquid present.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  In these experiments the apiculated ferment appeared sometimes, but\r\n  much less frequently than _saccharomyces pastorianus_. We also met\r\n  with the ellipsoidal ferment. We should probably have a greater\r\n  variety of ferments if our experiments could be conducted in the open\r\n  air, but insects and particles of dust of all kinds brought by the\r\n  wind render experiments under such conditions difficult and\r\n  untrustworthy. In a laboratory we have not these difficulties to\r\n  contend against, but, unfortunately, the operations ordinarily carried\r\n  on there cause the results of our experiments to be of a less general\r\n  character than they would be if obtained in free contact with country\r\n  air.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  [A rather serious clerical error appears to have here crept into the\r\n  original, for on referring to Plate I. and the letterpress descriptive\r\n  of No. 7 (p. 5), we find it applies to a very formidable species of\r\n  diseased ferment, whereas the author is here speaking of an amorphous\r\n  deposit, harmless in character, and more or less associated with all\r\n  yeasts. Doubtless No. 7 should stand No. 6, see p. 6.—D. C.

He says: “M. Pasteur seems to be in error in\r\n  stating (p. 190, Fr. ed.) that the bottom yeast may be distinguished\r\n  by being less spherical than top yeast. It is true that in London and\r\n  Edinburgh yeast, the cells will be found usually round; hard water,\r\n  however, such as that at Burton, or artificially made so, yields yeast\r\n  in which the cells are distinctly ovoid in appearance, resembling very\r\n  closely Bavarian bottom yeast.”—D.

Pasteur must be thinking rather of the inferior\r\n  products of the surface fermentation in France and Germany, than of\r\n  those of England and Scotland.”—D. C.

Pasteur has evidently employed the word “caseous” to express the\r\n  curdy nature of the ferment he is describing, its plasticity and other\r\n  peculiarities of physical character; but we are, nevertheless, tempted\r\n  to suggest that he may have had in mind also the peculiar “cheesy”\r\n  odour given off by these very yeasts, which he refers to in the text\r\n  as containing a considerable intermixture of “caseous ferment.”—F. F.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  The caseous ferment, however, must not be exposed to heat, under the\r\n  afore-mentioned conditions, when it is too young. At the commencement\r\n  of its development, for instance, within a few days of having been\r\n  sown. In such case, it would be in danger of perishing, probably in\r\n  consequence of the tenderness of its tissues. At the end of a\r\n  fermentation, and even several months afterwards, it might be safely\r\n  heated to 50° C. (122° Fahr.) without any harm to it. “Low” yeast also\r\n  can withstand a temperature of 50° C. in the medium in question.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Although we believe that the aërobian ferment of a particular yeast\r\n  may be produced by a kind of transformation of the cells of the\r\n  latter, yet we admit that this question is open to some doubt. The\r\n  facts which we unexpectedly discovered in connection with the\r\n  _caseous_ ferment should make us extremely careful, and disposed to\r\n  inquire whether aërobian ferments do not originally, in a state of\r\n  intermixture, form part of the ferments from which they spring. One\r\n  reason which might incline us to believe this, is the fact that a\r\n  ferment sometimes perishes without the appearance of aërobian ferment\r\n  on the surface. There is nothing very natural indeed in the hypothesis\r\n  that we advance, which sets aside the supposed intermixture; but, on\r\n  the other hand, if the aërobian ferment is a particular ferment,\r\n  simply intermixed with some other variety and developed by change of\r\n  conditions, how are we to account for its great resemblance in\r\n  appearance and mode of budding to the ferment on the surface of which\r\n  it appears? This resemblance, however, might be accounted for very\r\n  naturally if the two ferments were originally related.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  We insist on this fact, that Fig. 50 represents the forms on revival\r\n  of the aërobian ferment of _saccharomyces pastorianus, when this has\r\n  grown in a mineral medium_. When produced on the surface of fermented\r\n  wort, the aërobian ferment of which we are speaking presents no\r\n  peculiarity, nor is there any irregularity in its forms or in its\r\n  development, and when we proceed to cultivate it in a natural\r\n  saccharine medium, or in wort, it does not produce any forms of\r\n  _dematium_, as in the preceding case; but the reason of this is that,\r\n  in consequence of the nature of the first medium, which is better\r\n  adapted to its nutrition, it assumes at once, in the second medium,\r\n  the forms of deposit-yeast in the course of ordinary germination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  “La cassure de la levûre.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  We have reason to believe that the ratio of the proportions of these\r\n  ferments depends greatly on the climatic conditions preceding the\r\n  period of vintage, on the state of dryness or humidity, as well as the\r\n  temperature at the time of gathering the grapes, and also on the\r\n  nature of the vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n               THE PHYSIOLOGICAL THEORY OF FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n        § I.—On the Relations existing between Oxygen and Yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of all science is a continuous reduction of the number of\r\nunexplained phenomena. It is observed, for instance, that fleshy fruits\r\nare not liable to fermentation so long as their epidermis remains\r\nuninjured. On the other hand, they ferment very readily when they are\r\npiled up in heaps, more or less open, and immersed in their saccharine\r\njuice. The mass becomes heated and swells; carbonic acid gas is\r\ndisengaged, and the sugar disappears and is replaced by alcohol. Now, as\r\nto the question of the origin of these spontaneous phenomena, so\r\nremarkable in character as well as usefulness for man’s service, modern\r\nknowledge has taught us that fermentation is the consequence of a\r\ndevelopment of vegetable cells, the germs of which do not exist in the\r\nsaccharine juices within fruits; that many varieties of these cellular\r\nplants exist, each giving rise to its own particular fermentation. The\r\nprincipal products of these various fermentations, although resembling\r\neach other in their nature, differ in their relative proportions and in\r\nthe accessory substances that accompany them, a fact which alone is\r\nsufficient to account for wide differences in the quality and commercial\r\nvalue of alcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nNow that the discovery of ferments and their living nature, and our\r\nknowledge of their origin, may have solved the mystery of the\r\nspontaneous appearance of fermentations in natural saccharine juices, we\r\nmay ask whether we must still regard the reactions that occur in these\r\nfermentations as phenomena inexplicable by the ordinary laws of\r\nchemistry. We can readily see that fermentations occupy a special place\r\nin the series of chemical and biological phenomena. What gives to\r\nfermentations certain exceptional characters, of which we are only now\r\nbeginning to suspect the causes, is the mode of life in the minute\r\nplants designated under the generic name of _ferments_, a mode of life\r\nwhich is essentially different from that in other vegetables, and from\r\nwhich result phenomena equally exceptional throughout the whole range of\r\nthe chemistry of living beings.\r\n\r\nThe least reflection will suffice to convince us that the alcoholic\r\nferments must possess the faculty of vegetating and performing their\r\nfunctions out of contact with air. Let us consider, for instance, the\r\nmethod of vintage practised in the Jura. The bunches are laid at the\r\nfoot of the vine in a large tub, and the grapes there stripped from\r\nthem. When the grapes, some of which are uninjured, others bruised, and\r\nall moistened by the juice issuing from the latter, fill the tub—where\r\nthey form what is commonly called the _vintage_—they are conveyed in\r\nbarrels to large vessels fixed in cellars of a considerable depth. These\r\nvessels are not filled to more than three-quarters of their capacity.\r\nFermentation soon takes place in them, and the carbonic acid gas finds\r\nescape through the bunghole, the diameter of which, in the case of the\r\nlargest vessels, is not more than ten or twelve centimetres (about four\r\ninches). The wine is not drawn off before the end of two or three\r\nmonths. In this way it seems highly probable that the yeast which\r\nproduces the wine under such conditions must have developed, to a great\r\nextent at least, out of contact with oxygen. No doubt oxygen is not\r\nentirely absent from the first; nay, its limited presence is even a\r\nnecessity to the manifestation of the phenomena which follow. The grapes\r\nare stripped from the bunch in contact with air, and the must which\r\ndrops from the wounded fruit takes a little of this gas into solution.\r\nThis small quantity of air so introduced into the must, at the\r\ncommencement of operations, plays a most indispensable part, it being\r\nfrom the presence of this that the spores of ferments which are spread\r\nover the surface of the grapes and the woody part of the bunches derive\r\nthe power of starting their vital phenomena.[111] This air, however,\r\nespecially when the grapes have been stripped from the bunches, is in\r\nsuch small proportion, and that which is in contact with the liquid mass\r\nis so promptly expelled by the carbonic acid gas, which is evolved as\r\nsoon as a little yeast has formed, that it will readily be admitted that\r\nmost of the yeast is produced apart from the influence of oxygen,\r\nwhether free or in solution. We shall revert to this fact, which is of\r\ngreat importance. At present we are only concerned in pointing out that,\r\nfrom the mere knowledge of the practices of certain localities, we are\r\ninduced to believe that the cells of yeast, after they have developed\r\nfrom their spores, continue to live and multiply without the\r\nintervention of oxygen, and that the alcoholic ferments have a mode of\r\nlife which is probably quite exceptional, since it is not generally met\r\nwith in other species, vegetable or animal.\r\n\r\nAnother equally exceptional characteristic of yeast and fermentation in\r\ngeneral consists in the small proportion which the yeast that forms\r\nbears to the sugar that decomposes. In all other known beings the weight\r\nof nutritive matter assimilated corresponds with the weight of food used\r\nup, any difference that may exist being comparatively small. The life of\r\nyeast is entirely different. For a certain weight of yeast formed, we\r\nmay have ten times, twenty times, a hundred times as much sugar, or even\r\nmore decomposed, as we shall experimentally prove by-and-bye; that is to\r\nsay, that whilst the proportion varies in a precise manner, according to\r\nconditions which we shall have occasion to specify, it is also greatly\r\nout of proportion to the weight of the yeast. We repeat, the life of no\r\nother being, under its normal physiological conditions, can show\r\nanything similar. The alcoholic ferments, therefore, present themselves\r\nto us as plants which possess at least two singular properties: they can\r\nlive without air, that is, without oxygen, and they can cause\r\ndecomposition to an amount which, though variable, yet, as estimated by\r\nweight of product formed, is out of all proportion to the weight of\r\ntheir own substance. These are facts of so great importance, and so\r\nintimately connected with the theory of fermentation, that it is\r\nindispensable to endeavour to establish them experimentally, with all\r\nthe exactness of which they will admit.\r\n\r\nThe question before us is whether yeast is in reality an anaërobian\r\nplant, and what quantities of sugar it may cause to ferment, under the\r\nvarious conditions under which we cause it to act.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments were undertaken to solve this double\r\nproblem:—We took a double-necked flask, of three litres (five pints)\r\ncapacity, one of the tubes being curved and forming an escape for the\r\ngas; the other one, on the right hand side (Fig. 59), being furnished\r\nwith a glass tap. We filled this flask with pure yeast-water, sweetened\r\nwith 5 per cent. of sugar candy, the flask being so full that there was\r\nnot the least trace of air remaining above the tap or in the escape\r\ntube; this artificial wort had, however, been itself aerated. The curved\r\ntube was plunged in a porcelain vessel full of mercury, resting on a\r\nfirm support. In the small cylindrical funnel above the tap, the\r\ncapacity of which was from 10 c.c. to 15 c.c. (about half a fluid ounce)\r\nwe caused to ferment, at a temperature of 20° or 25° C. (about 75° F.),\r\nfive or six cubic centimetres of the saccharine liquid, by means of a\r\ntrace of yeast, which multiplied rapidly, causing fermentation, and\r\nforming a slight deposit of yeast at the bottom of the funnel above the\r\ntap. We then opened the tap, and some of the liquid in the funnel\r\nentered the flask, carrying with it the small deposit of yeast, which\r\nwas sufficient to impregnate the saccharine liquid contained in the\r\nflask. In this manner it is possible to introduce as small a quantity of\r\nyeast as we wish, a quantity the weight of which, we may say, is hardly\r\nappreciable. The yeast sown multiplies rapidly and produces\r\nfermentation, the carbonic acid gas from which is expelled into the\r\nmercury. In less than twelve days all the sugar had disappeared, and the\r\nfermentation had finished. There was a sensible deposit of yeast\r\nadhering to the sides of the flask; collected and dried it weighed 2·25\r\ngrammes (34 grains). It is evident that in this experiment the total\r\namount of yeast formed, if it required oxygen to enable it to live,\r\ncould not have absorbed, at most, more than the volume which was\r\noriginally held in solution in the saccharine liquid, when that was\r\nexposed to the air before being introduced into the flask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\nSome exact experiments conducted by M. Raulin in our laboratory have\r\nestablished the fact that saccharine worts, like water, soon become\r\nsaturated when shaken briskly with an excess of air, and also that they\r\nalways take into solution a little less air than saturated pure water\r\ncontains under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. At a\r\ntemperature of 25° C. (77° F.) therefore, if we adopt the coefficient of\r\nthe solubility of oxygen in water given in Bunsen’s tables, we find that\r\n1 litre (1-3/4 pints) of water saturated with air contains 5·5 c.c. (0·3\r\ncubic inch) of oxygen. The three litres of yeast-water in the flask,\r\nsupposing it to have been saturated, contained less than 16·5 c.c. (1\r\ncubic inch) of oxygen, or, in weight, less than 23 milligrammes (0·35\r\ngrains). This was the maximum amount of oxygen, supposing the greatest\r\npossible quantity to have been absorbed, that was required by the yeast\r\nformed in the fermentation of 150 grammes (4·8 Troy ounces) of sugar. We\r\nshall better understand the significance of this result later on. Let us\r\nrepeat the foregoing experiment, but under altered conditions. Let us\r\nfill, as before, our flask with sweetened yeast-water, but let this be\r\nfirst boiled, so as to expel all the air it contains. To effect this we\r\narrange our apparatus as represented in the accompanying sketch (Fig.\r\n60). We place our flask, A, on a tripod above a gas flame, and in place\r\nof the vessel of mercury substitute a porcelain dish, under which we can\r\nput a gas flame, and which contains some fermentable, saccharine liquid,\r\nsimilar to that with which the flask is filled. We boil the liquid in\r\nthe flask and that in the basin simultaneously, and then let them cool\r\ndown together, so that as the liquid in the flask cools some of the\r\nliquid is sucked from the basin into the flask. From a trial experiment\r\nwhich we conducted, determining the quantity of oxygen that remained in\r\nsolution in the liquid after cooling, according to M. Schützenberger’s\r\nvaluable method, by means of hydrosulphite of soda,[112] we found that\r\nthe three litres in the flask, treated as we have described, contained\r\nless than one milligramme (0·015 grain) of oxygen. At the same time we\r\nconducted another experiment, by way of comparison (Fig. 61). We took a\r\nflask, B, of larger capacity than the former one, which we filled about\r\nhalf with the same volume as before of a saccharine liquid of\r\nidentically the same composition. This liquid had been previously freed\r\nfrom alterative germs by boiling. In the funnel surmounting A, we put a\r\nfew cubic centimetres of saccharine liquid in a state of fermentation,\r\nand when this small quantity of liquid was in full fermentation, and the\r\nyeast in it was young and vigorous, we opened the tap, closing it again\r\nimmediately, so that a little of the liquid and yeast still remained in\r\nthe funnel. By this means we caused the liquid in A to ferment. We also\r\nimpregnated the liquid in B with some yeast taken from the funnel of A.\r\nWe then replaced the porcelain dish in which the curved escape tube of A\r\nhad been plunged, by a vessel filled with mercury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of two of these comparative fermentations\r\nand the results they gave.\r\n\r\nThe fermentable liquid was composed of yeast-water sweetened with 5 per\r\ncent. of sugar-candy; the ferment employed was _saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_.\r\n\r\nThe impregnation took place on January 20th. The flasks were placed in\r\nan oven at 25° C. (77° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flask A, without air._\r\n\r\n\r\n    January 21st.—Fermentation commenced; a little frothy liquid issued\r\n    from the escape-tube and covered the mercury.\r\n\r\n    The following days, fermentation was active. Examining the yeast\r\n    mixed with the froth that was expelled into the mercury by the\r\n    evolution of carbonic acid gas, we found that it was very fine,\r\n    young, and actively budding.\r\n\r\n    February 3rd.—Fermentation still continued, showing itself by a\r\n    number of little bubbles rising from the bottom of the liquid, which\r\n    had settled bright. The yeast was at the bottom in the form of a\r\n    deposit.\r\n\r\n    February 7th.—Fermentation still continued, but very languidly.\r\n\r\n    February 9th.—A very languid fermentation still went on, discernible\r\n    in little bubbles rising from the bottom of the flask.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flask B, with air._\r\n\r\n\r\n    January 21st.—A sensible development of yeast.\r\n\r\n    The following days, fermentation was active, and there was an\r\n    abundant froth on the surface of the liquid.\r\n\r\n    February 1st.—All symptoms of fermentation had ceased.\r\n\r\nAs the fermentation in A would have continued for a long time, being so\r\nvery languid, and as that in B had been finished for several days, we\r\nbrought to a close our two experiments on February 9th. To do this we\r\npoured off the liquids in A and B, collecting the yeasts on tared\r\nfilters. Filtration was an easy matter, more especially in the case of\r\nA. Examining the yeasts under the microscope, immediately after\r\ndecantation, we found that both of them remained very pure. The yeast in\r\nA was in little clusters, the globules of which were collected together,\r\nand appeared by their well defined borders to be ready for an easy\r\nrevival in contact with air.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the liquid in the flask B did not contain\r\nthe least trace of sugar; that in the flask A still contained some, as\r\nwas evident from the non-completion of fermentation, but not more than\r\n4·6 grammes (71 grains). Now, as each flask originally contained 3\r\nlitres of liquid, holding in solution 5 per cent. of sugar, it follows\r\nthat 150 grammes (2,310 grains) of sugar had fermented in the flask B,\r\nand 145·4 grammes (2,239·2 grains) in the flask A. The weights of yeast\r\nafter drying at 100° C. (212° F.) were—\r\n\r\n     For the flask B, with air      1·970 grammes (30·4 grains).\r\n     For the flask A, without air   1·368 grammes.[113]\r\n\r\nThe proportions were 1 of yeast to 76 of fermented sugar in the first\r\ncase, and 1 of yeast to 89 of fermented sugar in the second.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts the following consequences may be deduced:\r\n\r\n1. The fermentable liquid (flask B), which since it had been in contact\r\nwith air, necessarily held air in solution, although not to the point of\r\nsaturation, inasmuch as it had been once boiled to free it from all\r\nforeign germs, furnished a weight of yeast sensibly greater than that\r\nyielded by the liquid which contained no air at all (flask A), or, at\r\nleast, which could only have contained an exceedingly minute quantity.\r\n\r\n2. This same slightly aerated fermentable liquid fermented much more\r\nrapidly than the other. In eight or ten days it contained no more sugar;\r\nwhile the other, after twenty days, still contained an appreciable\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nIs this last fact to be explained by the greater quantity of yeast\r\nformed in B? By no means. At first, when the air has access to the\r\nliquid, much yeast is formed and little sugar disappears, as we shall\r\nprove immediately; nevertheless the yeast formed in contact with the air\r\nis more active than the other. Fermentation is correlative, first to the\r\ndevelopment of the globules, and then to the continued life of those\r\nglobules once formed. The more oxygen these last globules have at their\r\ndisposal during their formation, the more vigorous, transparent, and\r\nturgescent, and, as a consequence of this last quality, the more active\r\nthey are in decomposing sugar. We shall revert hereafter to these facts.\r\n\r\n3. In the airless flask the proportion of yeast to sugar was 1/89; it\r\nwas only 1/76 in the flask which had air at first.\r\n\r\nThe proportion that the weight of yeast formed bears to the weight of\r\nthe sugar is, therefore, variable, and this variation depends, to a\r\ncertain extent, upon the presence of air and the possibility of oxygen\r\nbeing absorbed by the yeast. We shall presently show that yeast\r\npossesses the power of absorbing that gas and emitting carbonic acid,\r\nlike ordinary fungi, that even oxygen may be reckoned amongst the number\r\nof food-stuffs that may be assimilated by this plant, and that this\r\nfixation of oxygen in yeast, as well as the oxidations resulting from\r\nit, have the most marked effect on the life of yeast, on the\r\nmultiplication of its cells, and on their activity as ferments acting\r\nupon sugar, whether immediately or afterwards, apart from supplies of\r\noxygen or air.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding experiment, conducted without the presence of air,\r\nthere is one circumstance particularly worthy of notice. This experiment\r\nsucceeds, that is to say, the yeast sown in the medium deprived of\r\noxygen develops, only when this yeast is in a state of great vigour. We\r\nhave already explained the meaning of this last expression. But we wish\r\nnow to call attention to a very evident fact in connection with this\r\npoint. We impregnate a fermentable liquid; yeast develops and\r\nfermentation appears. This lasts for several days and then ceases. Let\r\nus suppose that, from the day when fermentation first appears in the\r\nproduction of a minute froth, which gradually increases till it whitens\r\nthe surface of the liquid, we take, every twenty-four hours, or at\r\nlonger intervals, a trace of the yeast deposited on the bottom of the\r\nvessel and use it for starting fresh fermentations. Conducting these\r\nfermentations all under precisely the same conditions of temperature,\r\ncharacter, and volume of liquid, let us continue this for a prolonged\r\ntime, even after the original fermentation is finished. We shall have no\r\ndifficulty in seeing that the first signs of action in each of our\r\nseries of second fermentations appear always later and later in\r\nproportion to the length of time that has elapsed from the commencement\r\nof the original fermentation. In other words, the time necessary for the\r\ndevelopment of the germs and the production of that amount of yeast\r\nsufficient to cause the first appearance of fermentation varies with the\r\nstate of the impregnating cells, and is longer in proportion as the\r\ncells are further removed from the period of their formation. It is\r\nessential, in experiments of this kind, that the quantities of yeast\r\nsuccessively taken should be as nearly as possible equal in weight or\r\nvolume, since, _ceteris paribus_, fermentations manifest themselves more\r\nquickly the larger the quantity of yeast employed in impregnation.\r\n\r\nIf we compare under the microscope the appearance and character of the\r\nsuccessive quantities of yeast taken, we shall see plainly that the\r\nstructure of the cells undergoes a progressive change. The first sample\r\nwhich we take, quite at the beginning of the original fermentation,\r\ngenerally gives us cells rather larger than those later on, and\r\npossessing a remarkable tenderness. Their walls are extremely thin, the\r\nconsistency and softness of their protoplasm is akin to fluidity, and\r\ntheir granular contents appear in the form of scarcely visible spots.\r\nThe borders of the cells soon become more marked, a proof that their\r\nwalls undergo a thickening; their protoplasm also becomes denser, and\r\nthe granulations more distinct. Cells of the same organ, in the states\r\nof infancy and old age, should not differ more than the cells of which\r\nwe are speaking, taken in their extreme states. The progressive changes\r\nin the cells, after they have acquired their normal form and volume,\r\nclearly demonstrate the existence of a chemical work of a remarkable\r\nintensity, during which their weight increases, although in volume they\r\nundergo no sensible change, a fact that we have often characterized as\r\n“the continued life of cells already formed.” We may call this work a\r\nprocess of maturation on the part of the cells, almost the same that we\r\nsee going on in the case of adult beings in general, which continue to\r\nlive for a long time, even after they have become incapable of\r\nreproduction, and long after their volume has become permanently fixed.\r\n\r\nThis being so it is evident, we repeat, that, to multiply in a\r\nfermentable medium, quite out of contact with oxygen, the cells of yeast\r\nmust be extremely young, full of life and health, and still under the\r\ninfluence of the vital activity which they owe to the free oxygen which\r\nhas served to form them, and which they have perhaps stored up for a\r\ntime. When older, they reproduce themselves with much difficulty when\r\ndeprived of air, and gradually become more languid; and if they do\r\nmultiply, it is in strange and monstrous forms. A little older still,\r\nthey remain absolutely inert in a medium deprived of free oxygen. This\r\nis not because they are dead; for in general they may be revived in a\r\nmarvellous manner in the same liquid if it has been first aerated before\r\nthey are sown. It would not surprise us to learn that at this point\r\ncertain preconceived ideas suggest themselves to the mind of an\r\nattentive reader on the subject of the causes that may serve to account\r\nfor such strange phenomena in the life of these beings which our\r\nignorance hides under the expressions of _youth_ and _age_; this,\r\nhowever, is a subject that we cannot pause to consider here.\r\n\r\nAt this point we must observe—for it is a matter of great\r\nimportance—that, in the operations of the brewer there is always a time\r\nwhen the yeasts are in this state of vigorous youth of which we have\r\nbeen speaking, acquired under the influence of free oxygen, since all\r\nthe worts and all the yeasts of commerce are necessarily manipulated in\r\ncontact with air, and so impregnated more or less with oxygen. The yeast\r\nimmediately seizes upon this gas and acquires a state of freshness and\r\nactivity, which permits it to live afterwards out of contact with air,\r\nand to act as a ferment. Thus, in ordinary brewery practice, we find the\r\nyeast already formed in abundance even before the earliest external\r\nsigns of fermentation have made their appearance. In this first phase of\r\nits existence, yeast lives chiefly like an ordinary fungus.\r\n\r\nFrom the same circumstances it is clear that the brewer’s fermentations\r\nmay, speaking quite strictly, last for an indefinite time, in\r\nconsequence of the unceasing supply of fresh wort, and from the fact,\r\nmoreover, that the exterior air is constantly being introduced during\r\nthe work, and that the air contained in the fresh worts keeps up the\r\nvital activity of the yeast, as the act of breathing keeps up the vigour\r\nand life of cells in all living beings. If the air could not renew\r\nitself in any way, the vital activity which the cells originally\r\nreceived, under its influence, would become more and more exhausted, and\r\nthe fermentation eventually come to an end.\r\n\r\nWe may recount one of the results obtained in other experiments similar\r\nto the last, in which, however, we employed yeast which was still older\r\nthan that used for our experiment with flask A (Fig. 60), and moreover\r\ntook still greater precautions to prevent the presence of air. Instead\r\nof leaving the flask, as well as the dish, to cool slowly, after having\r\nexpelled all air by boiling, we permitted the liquid in the dish to\r\ncontinue boiling whilst the flask was being cooled by artificial means;\r\nthe end of the escape tube was then taken out of the still boiling dish\r\nand plunged into the mercury trough. In impregnating the liquid, instead\r\nof employing the contents of the small cylindrical funnel whilst still\r\nin a state of fermentation, we waited until this was finished. Under\r\nthese conditions, fermentation was still going on in our flask, after a\r\nlapse of three months. We stopped it and found that 0·255 gramme (3·9\r\ngrains) of yeast had been formed, and that 45 grammes (693 grains) of\r\nsugar had fermented, the ratio between the weights of yeast and sugar\r\nbeing thus 0·255/45 = 1/176. In this experiment the yeast developed with\r\nmuch difficulty, by reason of the conditions to which it had been\r\nsubjected. In appearance the cells varied much, some were to be found\r\nlarge, elongated, and of tubular aspect, some seemed very old and were\r\nextremely granular, whilst others were more transparent. All of them\r\nmight be considered abnormal cells.\r\n\r\nIn such experiments we encounter another difficulty. If the yeast sown\r\nin the non-aerated fermentable liquid is in the least degree impure,\r\nespecially if we use sweetened yeast-water, we may be sure that\r\nalcoholic fermentation will soon cease, if, indeed, it ever commences,\r\nand that accessory fermentations will go on. The vibrios of butyric\r\nfermentation, for instance, will propagate with remarkable facility\r\nunder these circumstances. Clearly then, the purity of the yeast at the\r\nmoment of impregnation, and the purity of the liquid in the funnel, are\r\nconditions indispensable to success.\r\n\r\nTo secure the latter of these conditions, we close the funnel, as shown\r\nin Fig. 60, by means of a cork pierced with two holes, through one of\r\nwhich a short tube passes, to which a short length of india-rubber\r\ntubing provided with a glass stopper is attached; through the other hole\r\na thin curved tube is passed. Thus fitted, the funnel can answer the\r\nsame purposes as our double-necked flasks. A few cubic centimetres of\r\nsweetened yeast-water are then put in it and boiled, so that the steam\r\nmay destroy any germs adhering to the sides. When cold the liquid is\r\nimpregnated by means of a trace of pure yeast, introduced through the\r\nglass-stoppered tube. If these precautions are neglected it is scarcely\r\npossible to secure a successful fermentation in our flasks, because the\r\nyeast sown is immediately held in check by a development of anaërobian\r\nvibrios. For greater security, we may add to the fermentable liquid, at\r\nthe moment when it is prepared, a very small quantity of tartaric acid,\r\nwhich will prevent the development of butyric vibrios.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nThe variation of the ratio between the weight of the yeast and that of\r\nthe sugar decomposed by it now claims special attention. Side by side\r\nwith the experiments which we have just described, we conducted a third\r\nlot by means of the flask C (Fig. 62), holding 4·7 litres (8-1/4 pints),\r\nand fitted up like the usual two-necked flasks, with the object of\r\nfreeing the fermentable liquid from foreign germs, by boiling it to\r\nbegin with, so that we might carry on our work under conditions of\r\npurity. The volume of yeast-water (containing 5 per cent. of sugar) was\r\nonly 200 c.c. (7 fl. oz.), and consequently, taking into account the\r\ncapacity of the flask, it formed but a very thin layer at the bottom. On\r\nthe day after impregnation the deposit of yeast was already\r\nconsiderable, and forty-eight hours afterwards the fermentation was\r\ncompleted. On the third day we collected the yeast, after having\r\nanalyzed the gas contained in the flask. This analysis was easily\r\naccomplished by placing the flask in a hot-water bath, whilst the end of\r\nthe curved tube was plunged under a cylinder of mercury. The gas\r\ncontained 41·4 per cent. of carbonic acid, and, after the absorption,\r\nthe remaining air contained—\r\n\r\n                         Oxygen           19·7\r\n                         Nitrogen         80·3\r\n                                           ——-\r\n                                         100·0\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the volume of the flask, this shows a minimum\r\nof 50 c.c. (3·05 cub. in.) of oxygen to have been absorbed by the yeast.\r\nThe liquid contained no more sugar, and the weight of the yeast, dried\r\nat a temperature of 100° C. (212° F.), was 0·44 gramme (6·8 grains). The\r\nratio between the weight of the yeast and that of the sugar was,\r\ntherefore, 0·44/[114]10 = 1/22·7. On this occasion, where we had\r\nincreased the quantity of oxygen held in solution, so as to yield itself\r\nfor assimilation at the beginning and during the earlier developments of\r\nthe yeast, we found instead of the previous ratio of 1/76 that of 1/23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nThe next experiment was to increase the proportion of oxygen to a still\r\ngreater extent, by rendering the diffusion of gas a more easy matter\r\nthan it is in a flask, the air in which is in a state of perfect\r\nquiescence. Such a state of matters hinders the supply of oxygen,\r\ninasmuch as the carbonic acid, as soon as it is liberated, at once forms\r\nan immovable layer on the surface of the liquid, and so separates off\r\nthe oxygen. To effect the purpose of our present experiment, we used\r\nflat basins having glass bottoms and low sides, also of glass, in which\r\nthe depth of the liquid is not more than a few millimetres (less than\r\n1/4-inch) (Fig. 63). The following is one of our experiments so\r\nconducted:—On April 16th, 1860, we sowed a trace of beer yeast (“high”\r\nyeast) in 200 c.c. (7 fl. oz.) of a saccharine liquid containing 1·720\r\ngrammes (26·2 grains) of sugar-candy. From April 18th our yeast was in\r\ngood condition and well developed. We collected it, after having added\r\nto the liquid a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid, with the\r\nobject of checking the fermentation to a great extent, and facilitating\r\nfiltration. The sugar remaining in the filtered liquid, determined by\r\nFehling’s solution, showed that 1·04 grammes (16 grains) of sugar had\r\ndisappeared. The weight of the yeast, dried at 100° C. (212° F.), was\r\n0·127 gramme (2 grains), which gives us the ratio between the weight of\r\nthe yeast and that of the fermented sugar\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Formula 1: 0·127/1·04 = 1/8·1.]\r\n\r\nwhich is considerably higher than the preceding ones.\r\n\r\nWe may still further increase this ratio by making our estimation as\r\nsoon as possible after the impregnation, or the addition of the ferment.\r\nIt will be readily understood why yeast, which is composed of cells that\r\nbud and subsequently detach themselves from one another, soon forms a\r\ndeposit at the bottom of the vessels.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this habit of growth, the cells constantly covering\r\neach other prevents the lower layers from having access to the oxygen\r\nheld in solution in the liquid, which is absorbed by the upper ones.\r\nHence, those which are covered and deprived of this gas act on the sugar\r\nwithout deriving any vital benefit from the oxygen—a circumstance which\r\nmust tend to diminish the ratio of which we are speaking. Once more\r\nrepeating the preceding experiment, but stopping it as soon as we think\r\nthat the weight of yeast formed may be determined by the balance (we\r\nfind that this may be done twenty-four hours after impregnation with an\r\ninappreciable quantity of yeast) in this case the ratio between the\r\nweights of yeast and sugar is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Formula 2: (0^{gr}·024 yeast)/(0^{gr}·098 sugar) = 1/4.]\r\n\r\nThis is the highest ratio that we have been able to obtain.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the fermentation of sugar is extremely languid:\r\nthe ratio obtained is very nearly the same that ordinary fungoid growths\r\nwould give. The carbonic acid evolved is principally formed by the\r\ndecompositions which result from the assimilation of atmospheric oxygen.\r\nThe yeast, therefore, lives and performs its functions after the manner\r\nof ordinary fungi: so far it is no longer a ferment, so to say;\r\nmoreover, we might expect to find it cease to be a ferment at all if we\r\ncould only surround each cell separately with all the air that it\r\nrequired. This is what the preceding phenomena teach us; we shall have\r\noccasion to compare them later on with others which relate to the vital\r\naction exercised on yeast by the sugar of milk.\r\n\r\nWe may here be permitted to make a digression.\r\n\r\nIn his work on fermentations, which M. Schützenberger has recently\r\npublished, the author criticises the deductions that we have drawn from\r\nthe preceding experiments, and combats the explanation which we have\r\ngiven of the phenomena of fermentation.[115] It is an easy matter to\r\nshow the weak point of M. Schützenberger’s reasoning. We determined the\r\npower of the ferment by the relation of the weight of sugar decomposed\r\nto the weight of yeast produced. M. Schützenberger asserts that in doing\r\nthis we lay down a doubtful hypothesis, and he thinks that this power,\r\nwhich he terms _fermentative energy_, may be estimated more correctly by\r\nthe quantity of sugar decomposed by the unit-weight of yeast in\r\nunit-time; moreover, since our experiments show that yeast is very\r\nvigorous when it has a sufficient supply of oxygen, and that, in such a\r\ncase, it can decompose much sugar in a little time, M. Schützenberger\r\nconcludes that it must then have great power as a ferment, even greater\r\nthan it has when it performs its functions without the aid of air, since\r\nunder this condition it decomposes sugar very slowly. In short, he is\r\ndisposed to draw from our observations the very opposite conclusion to\r\nthat which we arrived at.\r\n\r\nM. Schützenberger has failed to notice that the power of a ferment is\r\nindependent of the time during which it performs its functions. We\r\nplaced a trace of yeast in one litre of saccharine wort; it propagated,\r\nand all the sugar was decomposed. Now, whether the chemical action\r\ninvolved in this decomposition of sugar had required for its completion\r\none day, or one month, or one year, such a factor was of no more\r\nimportance in this matter than the mechanical labour required to raise a\r\nton of materials from the ground to the top of a house would be affected\r\nby the fact that it had taken twelve hours instead of one. The notion of\r\ntime has nothing to do with the definition of work. M. Schützenberger\r\nhas not perceived that in introducing the consideration of time into the\r\ndefinition of the power of a ferment, he must introduce, at the same\r\ntime, that of the vital activity of the cells, which is independent of\r\ntheir character as a ferment. Apart from the consideration of the\r\nrelation existing between the weight of fermentable substance decomposed\r\nand that of ferment produced, there is no occasion to speak of\r\nfermentations or of ferments. The phenomena of fermentation and of\r\nferments have been placed apart from others, precisely because, in\r\ncertain chemical actions, that ratio has been out of proportion; but the\r\ntime that these phenomena require for their accomplishment has nothing\r\nto do either with their existence proper, or with their power. The cells\r\nof a ferment may, under some circumstances, require eight days for\r\nrevival and propagation, whilst, under other conditions, only a few\r\nhours are necessary; so that, if we introduce the notion of time into\r\nour estimate of their power of decomposition, we may be led to conclude\r\nthat in the first case that power was entirely wanting, and that in the\r\nsecond case it was considerable, although all the time we are dealing\r\nwith the same organism—the identical ferment.\r\n\r\nM. Schützenberger is astonished that fermentation can take place in the\r\npresence of free oxygen, if, as we suppose, the decomposition of the\r\nsugar is the consequence of the nutrition of the yeast, at the expense\r\nof the combined oxygen, which yields itself to the ferment. At all\r\nevents, he argues, fermentation ought to be slower in the presence of\r\nfree oxygen. But why should it be slower? We have proved that in the\r\npresence of oxygen the vital activity of the cells increases, so that,\r\nas far as rapidity of action is concerned, its power cannot be\r\ndiminished. It might, nevertheless, be weakened as a ferment, and this\r\nis precisely what happens. Free oxygen imparts to the yeast an increased\r\nvital activity, but at the same time impairs rapidly its power as\r\nyeast—_quâ_ yeast, inasmuch as under this condition it approaches the\r\nstate in which it can carry on its vital processes after the manner of\r\nan ordinary fungus; the mode of life, that is, in which the ratio\r\nbetween the weight of sugar decomposed and the weight of the new cells\r\nproduced will be the same as holds generally among organisms which are\r\nnot ferments. In short, varying our form of expression a little, we may\r\nconclude with perfect truth, from the sum total of observed facts, that\r\nthe yeast which lives in the presence of oxygen and can assimilate as\r\nmuch of that gas as is necessary to its perfect nutrition, ceases\r\nabsolutely to be a ferment at all. Nevertheless, yeast formed under\r\nthese conditions and subsequently brought into the presence of sugar,\r\n_out of the influence of air_, would decompose more _in a given time_\r\nthan in any other of its states. The reason is that yeast which has\r\nformed in contact with air, having the maximum of free oxygen that it\r\ncan assimilate, is fresher and possessed of greater vital activity than\r\nthat which has been formed without air or with an insufficiency of air.\r\nM. Schützenberger would associate this activity with the notion of time\r\nin estimating the power of the ferment; but he forgets to notice that\r\nyeast can only manifest this maximum of energy under a radical change of\r\nits life-conditions; by having no more air at its disposal and breathing\r\nno more free oxygen. In other words, when its respiratory power becomes\r\nnull, its fermentative power is at its greatest. M. Schützenberger\r\nasserts exactly the opposite (p. 151 of his work—Paris, 1875),[116] and\r\nso gratuitously places himself in opposition to facts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nIn presence of abundant air-supply, yeast vegetates with extraordinary\r\nactivity. We see this in the weight of new yeast, comparatively large,\r\nthat may be formed in the course of a few hours. The microscope still\r\nmore clearly shows this activity in the rapidity of budding, and the\r\nfresh and active appearance of all the cells. Fig. 64 represents the\r\nyeast of our last experiment at the moment when we stopped the\r\nfermentation. Nothing has been taken from imagination, all the groups\r\nhave been faithfully sketched as they were.[117]\r\n\r\nIn passing it is of interest to note how promptly the preceding results\r\nwere turned to good account practically. In well-managed distilleries,\r\nthe custom of aerating the wort and the juices, to render them more\r\nadapted to fermentation, has been introduced. The molasses, mixed with\r\nwater, is permitted to run in thin threads through the air at the moment\r\nwhen the yeast is added. Manufactories have been erected, in which the\r\nmanufacture of yeast is almost exclusively carried on. The saccharine\r\nworts, after the addition of yeast, are left to themselves, in contact\r\nwith air, in shallow vats of large superficial area, realizing thus on\r\nan immense scale the conditions of the experiments which we undertook in\r\n1861, and which we have already described in determining the rapid and\r\neasy multiplication of yeast in contact with air.\r\n\r\nThe next experiment attempted was to determine the volume of oxygen\r\nabsorbed by a known quantity of yeast, the yeast living in contact with\r\nair, and under such conditions that the absorption of air was\r\ncomparatively easy and abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nWith this object we repeated the experiment that we performed with the\r\nlarge-bottomed flask (Fig. 62), employing a vessel shaped like Fig. B.\r\n(Fig. 65), which is, in point of fact, the flask A with its neck drawn\r\nout and closed in a flame, after the introduction of a thin layer of\r\nsome saccharine juice impregnated with a trace of pure yeast. The\r\nfollowing are the data and results of an experiment of this kind.\r\n\r\nWe employed 60 c.c. (about 2 fluid ounces) of yeast-water, sweetened\r\nwith 2 per cent. of sugar and impregnated with a trace of yeast. After\r\nhaving subjected our vessel to a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.) in an\r\noven for fifteen hours, the drawn-out point was brought under an\r\ninverted jar filled with mercury and the point broken off. A portion of\r\nthe gas escaped and was collected in the jar.\r\n\r\nFor 25 c.c. of this gas we found, after absorption by potash, 20·6, and\r\nafter absorption by pyrogallic acid, 17·3. Taking into account the\r\nvolume which remained free in the flask, which held 315 c.c., there was\r\na total absorption of 14·5 c.c. (0·88 cub. in.) of oxygen.[118] The\r\nweight of yeast, in a state of dryness, was 0·035 gramme.\r\n\r\nIt follows that in the production of 35 milligrammes (0·524 grain) of\r\nyeast there was an absorption of 14 or 15 c.c. (about 7/8 cubic inch) of\r\noxygen, even supposing that the yeast was formed entirely under the\r\ninfluence of that gas: this is equivalent to not less than 414 c.c. for\r\n1 gramme of yeast (or about 33 cubic inches for every 20 grains).[119]\r\n\r\nSuch is the large volume of oxygen necessary for the development of one\r\ngramme of yeast when the plant can assimilate this gas after the manner\r\nof an ordinary fungus.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the first experiment described in this paragraph\r\n(page 238), in which a flask of three litres capacity was filled with\r\nfermentable liquid, which, when caused to ferment, yielded 2·25 grammes\r\nof yeast, under circumstances where it could not obtain a greater supply\r\nof free oxygen than 16·5 c.c. (about one cubic inch). According to what\r\nwe have just stated, if this 2·25 grammes (34 grains) of yeast had not\r\nbeen able to live without oxygen, in other words, if the original cells\r\nhad been unable to multiply otherwise than by absorbing free oxygen, the\r\namount of that gas required could not have been less than 2·25 × 414\r\nc.c., that is, 931·5 c.c. (56·85 cubic inches). The greater part of the\r\n2·25 grammes, therefore, had evidently been produced as the growth of an\r\nanaërobian plant.\r\n\r\nOrdinary fungi likewise require large quantities of oxygen for their\r\ndevelopment, as we may easily prove by cultivating any mould in a closed\r\nvessel full of air, and then taking the weight of plant formed and\r\nmeasuring the volume of oxygen absorbed. To do this, we take a flask of\r\nthe shape shown in Fig. 66, capable of holding about 300 c.c. (10-½\r\nfluid ounces), and containing a liquid adapted to the life of moulds. We\r\nboil this liquid and seal the drawn-out point, after the steam has\r\nexpelled the air wholly or in part; we then open the flask in a garden\r\nor in a room. Should a fungus-spore enter the flask, as will invariably\r\nbe the case in a certain number of flasks out of several used in the\r\nexperiment, except under special circumstances, it will develop there\r\nand gradually absorb all the oxygen contained in the air of the flask.\r\nMeasuring the volume of this air, and weighing, after drying, the amount\r\nof plant formed, we find that for a certain quantity of oxygen absorbed\r\nwe have a certain weight of mycelium, or of mycelium together with its\r\norgans of fructification. In an experiment of this kind, in which the\r\nplant was weighed a year after its development, we found for 0·008\r\ngramme (0·123 grain) of _mycelium_, dried at 100° C. (212° F.), an\r\nabsorption that amounted to not less than 43 c.c. (1·5 cubic inches) of\r\noxygen, at 25°. These numbers, however, must vary sensibly with the\r\nnature of the mould employed, and also with the greater or less activity\r\nof its development, because the phenomenon is complicated by the\r\npresence of accessory oxidations, such as we find in the case of\r\n_mycoderma vini_ and _aceti_, to which cause the large absorption of\r\noxygen in our last experiment may doubtless be attributed.[120]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the whole of the preceding facts can\r\nscarcely admit of doubt. As for ourselves, we have no hesitation in\r\nfinding in them the foundation of the true theory of fermentation. In\r\nthe experiments which we have described, fermentation by yeast, that is\r\nto say, by the type of ferments properly so called, is presented to us,\r\nin a word, as the direct consequence of the processes of nutrition,\r\nassimilation, and life, when these are carried on without the agency of\r\nfree oxygen. The heat required in the accomplishment of that work must\r\nnecessarily have been borrowed from the decomposition of the fermentable\r\nmatter, that is from the saccharine substance which, like other unstable\r\nsubstances, liberates heat in undergoing decomposition. Fermentation by\r\nmeans of yeast appears, therefore, to be essentially connected with the\r\nproperty possessed by this minute cellular plant of performing its\r\nrespiratory functions, somehow or other, with oxygen existing combined\r\nin sugar. Its fermentative power—which power must not be confounded with\r\nthe fermentative activity or the intensity of decomposition in a given\r\ntime—varies considerably between two limits, fixed by the greatest and\r\nleast possible access to free oxygen which the plant has in the process\r\nof nutrition. If we supply it with a sufficient quantity of free oxygen\r\nfor the necessities of its life, nutrition, and respiratory combustions,\r\nin other words, if we cause it to live after the manner of a mould,\r\nproperly so called, it ceases to be a ferment, that is, the ratio\r\nbetween the weight of the plant developed and that of the sugar\r\ndecomposed, which forms its principal food, is similar in amount to that\r\nin the case of fungi.[121] On the other hand, if we deprive the yeast of\r\nair entirely, or cause it to develop in a saccharine medium deprived of\r\nfree oxygen, it will multiply just as if air were present, although with\r\nless activity, and under these circumstances its fermentative character\r\nwill be most marked; under these circumstances, moreover, we shall find\r\nthe greatest disproportion, all other conditions being the same, between\r\nthe weight of yeast formed and the weight of sugar decomposed. Lastly,\r\nif free oxygen occurs in varying quantities, the ferment-power of the\r\nyeast may pass through all the degrees comprehended between the two\r\nextreme limits of which we have just spoken. It seems to us that we\r\ncould not have a better proof of the direct relation that fermentation\r\nbears to life, carried on in the absence of free oxygen, or with a\r\nquantity of that gas insufficient for all the acts of nutrition and\r\nassimilation.\r\n\r\nAnother equally striking proof of the truth of this theory is the fact,\r\ndemonstrated in Chapter IV., that the ordinary moulds assume the\r\ncharacter of a ferment when compelled to live without air, or with\r\nquantities of air too scant to permit of their organs having around them\r\nas much of that element as is necessary for their life as aërobian\r\nplants. Ferments, therefore, only possess in a higher degree a character\r\nwhich belongs to many common moulds, if not to all, and which they\r\nshare, probably, more or less, with all living cells, namely the power\r\nof living either an aërobian or anaërobian life, according to the\r\nconditions under which they are placed.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily understood how, in their state of aërobian life, the\r\nalcoholic ferments have failed to attract attention. Those ferments are\r\nonly cultivated out of contact with air, at the bottom of liquids which\r\nsoon become saturated with carbonic acid gas. Air is only present in the\r\nearlier developments of their germs, and without attracting the\r\nattention of the operator, whilst in their state of anaërobian growth\r\ntheir life and action are of prolonged duration. We must have recourse\r\nto special experimental apparatus to enable us to demonstrate the mode\r\nof life of alcoholic ferments under the influence of free oxygen; it is\r\ntheir state of existence apart from air, in the depths of liquids that\r\nattracts all our attention. The results of their action are, however,\r\nmarvellous, if we regard the products resulting from them, in the\r\nimportant industries of which they are the life and soul. In the case of\r\nordinary moulds, the opposite holds good. What we want to use special\r\nexperimental apparatus for with them is to enable us to demonstrate the\r\npossibility of their continuing to live for a time out of contact with\r\nair, and all our attention, in their case, is attracted by the facility\r\nwith which they develop under the influence of oxygen. Thus the\r\ndecomposition of saccharine liquids, which is the consequence of the\r\nlife of fungi without air, is scarcely perceptible, and so is of no\r\npractical importance. Their aerial life, on the other hand, in which\r\nthey respire and accomplish their process of oxidation under the\r\ninfluence of free oxygen, is a normal phenomenon, and one of prolonged\r\nduration which cannot fail to strike the least thoughtful of observers.\r\nWe are convinced that a day will come when moulds will be utilized in\r\ncertain industrial operations, on account of their power of destroying\r\norganic matter. The conversion of alcohol into vinegar in the process of\r\nacetification, and the production of gallic acid by the action of fungi\r\non wet gall-nuts, are already connected with this kind of\r\nphenomena.[122] On this last subject, the important work of M. Van\r\nTieghem (_Annales Scientifiques de l’École Normale_, vol. vi.) may be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of living without oxygen, in the case of ordinary\r\nmoulds, is connected with certain morphological modifications which are\r\nmore marked in proportion as this faculty is itself more developed.\r\nThese changes in the vegetative forms are scarcely perceptible in the\r\ncase of _penicillium_ and _mycoderma vini_, but they are very evident in\r\nthe case of _aspergillus_, consisting of a marked tendency on the part\r\nof the submerged mycelial filaments to increase in diameter, and to\r\ndevelop cross partitions at short intervals, so that they sometimes bear\r\na resemblance to chains of conidia. In _mucor_, again, they are very\r\nmarked, the inflated filaments which, closely interwoven, present chains\r\nof cells which fall off and bud, gradually producing a mass of cells. If\r\nwe consider the matter carefully, we shall see that yeast presents the\r\nsame characteristics. For instance, what can more closely resemble the\r\nmucor of Plates V. and VI. than the _saccharomyces_ of Figs. 33 and 37?\r\nHave we not in each case ramified chains of elongated cells or joints,\r\nmore or less narrowed in the middle, and shorter segments or cells\r\ndropping off at the constrictions, and proceeding to bud in the liquid\r\non their own account? Moreover, the less oxygen there is present, the\r\nmore marked is the tendency to the formation of these budding cells,\r\nwhich isolate themselves and soon drop off. Who could ever imagine, in\r\nexamining the ferment of _mucor_ represented in Plate VI., that its\r\nfirst germ was the ordinary _mucor_ that is found everywhere, with fine\r\nfilaments, straight or ramified according to the variety, which send up\r\naerial _hyphae_, terminating in little round heads bearing spores. So\r\nwas it that in the ferment of Plate XI. we could scarcely recognize the\r\nramified filaments of Figs. 33 and 37.\r\n\r\nIt is a great presumption in favour of the truth of theoretical ideas\r\nwhen the results of experiments undertaken on the strength of those\r\nideas are confirmed by various facts more recently added to science, and\r\nwhen those ideas force themselves more and more on our minds, in spite\r\nof a _primâ facie_ improbability. This is exactly the character of those\r\nideas which we have just expounded. We propounded them in 1861, and not\r\nonly have they remained unshaken since, but they have served to\r\nforeshadow new facts, so that it is much easier to defend them in the\r\npresent day than it was to do so fifteen years ago. We first called\r\nattention to them in various notes, which we read before the Chemical\r\nSociety of Paris, notably at its meetings of April 12th and June 28th,\r\n1861, and in papers in the _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_.\r\nIt may be of some interest to quote here, in its entirety, our\r\ncommunication of June 28th, 1861, entitled, “Influences of Oxygen on the\r\nDevelopment of Yeast and on Alcoholic Fermentation,” which we extract\r\nfrom the _Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris_:—\r\n\r\n“M. Pasteur gives the results of his researches on the fermentation of\r\nsugar and the development of yeast-cells, according as that fermentation\r\ntakes place apart from the influence of free oxygen or in contact with\r\nthat gas. His experiments, however, have nothing in common with those of\r\nGay-Lussac, which were performed with the juice of grapes, crushed under\r\nconditions where they would not be affected by air, and then brought in\r\ncontact with oxygen.\r\n\r\n“Yeast, when perfectly developed, is able to bud and grow in a\r\nsaccharine and albuminous liquid, in the complete absence of oxygen or\r\nair. In this case but little yeast is formed, and a comparatively large\r\nquantity of sugar disappears—sixty or eighty parts for one of yeast\r\nformed. Under these conditions fermentation is very sluggish.\r\n\r\n“If the experiment is made in contact with the air, and with a great\r\nsurface of liquid, fermentation is rapid. For the same quantity of sugar\r\ndecomposed much more yeast is formed. The air with which the liquid is\r\nin contact is absorbed by the yeast. The yeast develops very actively,\r\nbut its fermentative character tends to disappear under these\r\nconditions; we find, in fact, that for one part of yeast formed, not\r\nmore than from four to ten parts of sugar are transformed. The\r\nfermentative character of this yeast, nevertheless, continues, and\r\nproduces even increased effects, if it is made to act on sugar apart\r\nfrom the influence of free oxygen.\r\n\r\n“It seems, therefore, natural to admit that when yeast functions as a\r\nferment by living apart from the influence of air, it derives oxygen\r\nfrom the sugar, and that this is the origin of its fermentative\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n“M. Pasteur explains the fact of the immense activity at the\r\ncommencement of fermentations by the influence of the oxygen of the air\r\nheld in solution in the liquids, at the time when the action commences.\r\nThe author has found, moreover, that the yeast of beer sown in an\r\nalbuminous liquid, such as yeast-water, still multiplies, even when\r\nthere is not a trace of sugar in the liquid, provided always that\r\natmospheric oxygen is present in large quantities. When deprived of air,\r\nunder these conditions, yeast does not germinate at all. The same\r\nexperiments may be repeated with albuminous liquid, mixed with a\r\nsolution of non-fermentable sugar, such as ordinary crystallized\r\nmilk-sugar. The results are precisely the same.\r\n\r\n“Yeast formed thus in the absence of sugar does not change its nature;\r\nit is still capable of causing sugar to ferment, if brought to bear upon\r\nthat substance apart from air. It must be remarked, however, that the\r\ndevelopment of yeast is effected with great difficulty when it has not a\r\nfermentable substance for its food. In short, the yeast of beer acts in\r\nexactly the same manner as an ordinary plant, and the analogy would be\r\ncomplete if ordinary plants had such an affinity for oxygen as permitted\r\nthem to breathe by appropriating this element from unstable compounds,\r\nin which case, according to M. Pasteur, they would appear as ferments\r\nfor those substances.\r\n\r\n“M. Pasteur declares that he hopes to be able to realize this result,\r\nthat is to say, to discover the conditions under which certain inferior\r\nplants may live apart from air in the presence of sugar, causing that\r\nsubstance to ferment as the yeast of beer would do.”\r\n\r\nThis summary and the preconceived views that it set forth have lost\r\nnothing of their exactness; on the contrary, time has strengthened them.\r\nThe surmises of the last two paragraphs have received a valuable\r\nconfirmation from recent observations made by Messrs. Lechartier and\r\nBellamy, as well as by ourselves, an account of which we must put before\r\nour readers. It is necessary, however, before touching upon this curious\r\nfeature in connection with fermentations to insist on the accuracy of a\r\npassage in the preceding summary, the statement, namely, that yeast\r\ncould multiply in an albuminous liquid, in which it found a\r\nnon-fermentable sugar, milk-sugar for example. The following is an\r\nexperiment on this point:—On August 15th, 1875, we sowed a trace of\r\nyeast in 150 c.c. (rather more than 5 fluid ounces) of yeast-water,\r\ncontaining 2-½ per cent. of milk-sugar. The solution was prepared in one\r\nof our double-necked flasks, with the necessary precautions to secure\r\nabsence of germs, and the yeast sown was itself perfectly pure. Three\r\nmonths afterwards, November 15th, 1875, we examined the liquid for\r\nalcohol; it contained only the smallest trace; as for the yeast, which\r\nhad sensibly developed, collected and dried on a filter paper, it\r\nweighed 0·050 gramme (0·76 grain). In this case we have the yeast\r\nmultiplying without giving rise to the least fermentation, like a\r\nfungoid growth, absorbing oxygen, and evolving carbonic acid, and there\r\nis no doubt that the cessation of its development in this experiment was\r\ndue to the progressive deprivation of oxygen that occurred. As soon as\r\nthe gaseous mixture in the flask consisted entirely of carbonic acid and\r\nnitrogen, the vitality of the yeast was dependent on, and in proportion\r\nto, the quantity of air which entered the flask in consequence of\r\nvariations of temperature. The question now arose, was this yeast, which\r\nhad developed wholly as an ordinary fungus, still capable of manifesting\r\nthe character of a ferment? To settle this point we had taken the\r\nprecaution, on August 15th, 1875, of preparing another flask, exactly\r\nsimilar to the preceding one in every respect, and which gave results\r\nidentical with those described. We decanted this on November 15th,\r\npouring some wort on the deposit of the plant, which remained in the\r\nflask. In less than five hours from the time when we placed it in the\r\noven, the plant had started fermentation in the wort, as we could see by\r\nthe bubbles of gas rising to form patches on the surface of the liquid.\r\nWe may add that yeast in the medium which we have been discussing will\r\nnot develop at all without air.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these results can escape no one; they prove clearly\r\nthat the fermentative character is not an invariable phenomenon of\r\nyeast-life, they show that yeast is a plant which does not differ from\r\nordinary plants, and which manifests its fermentative power solely in\r\nconsequence of particular conditions under which it is compelled to\r\nlive. It may carry on its life as a ferment or not, and after having\r\nlived without manifesting the slightest symptom of fermentative\r\ncharacter, it is quite ready to manifest that character when brought\r\nunder suitable conditions. The fermentative property, therefore, is not\r\na power peculiar to cells of a special nature. It is not a permanent\r\ncharacter of a particular structure, like, for instance, the property of\r\nacidity or alkalinity. It is a peculiarity dependent on external\r\ncircumstances and on the nutritive conditions of the organism.\r\n\r\n\r\n § II.—Fermentation in Saccharine Fruits Immersed in Carbonic Acid Gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory which we have, step by step, evolved, on the subject of the\r\ncauses of the chemical phenomena of fermentation, may claim a character\r\nof simplicity and generality that is well worthy of attention.\r\nFermentation is no longer one of those isolated and mysterious phenomena\r\nwhich do not admit of explanation. It is the consequence of a peculiar\r\nvital process of nutrition which occurs under certain conditions,\r\ndiffering from those which characterize the life of all ordinary beings,\r\nanimal or vegetable, but by which the latter may be affected, more or\r\nless, in a way which brings them, to some extent. within the class of\r\nferments, properly so called. We can even conceive that the fermentative\r\ncharacter may belong to every organized form, to every animal or\r\nvegetable cell, on the sole condition that the chemico-vital acts of\r\nassimilation and excretion must be capable of taking place in that cell\r\nfor a brief period, longer or shorter it may be, without the necessity\r\nfor recourse to supplies of atmospheric oxygen; in other words, the cell\r\nmust be able to derive its needful heat from the decomposition of some\r\nbody which yields a surplus of heat in the process.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of these conclusions it should be an easy matter to\r\nshow, in the majority of living beings, the manifestation of the\r\nphenomena of fermentation; for there are, probably, none in which all\r\nchemical action entirely disappears, upon the sudden cessation of life.\r\nOne day, when we were expressing these views in our laboratory, in the\r\npresence of M. Dumas, who seemed inclined to admit their truth, we\r\nadded: “We would make a wager that if we were to plunge a bunch of\r\ngrapes into carbonic acid gas, there would be immediately produced\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid, in consequence of a renewed action starting\r\nin the interior cells of the grapes, in such a way that these cells\r\nwould assume the function of yeast-cells. We will make the experiment,\r\nand when you come to-morrow—it was our good fortune to have M. Dumas\r\nworking in our laboratory at that time—we will give you an account of\r\nthe result.” Our predictions were realized. We then endeavoured to find,\r\nin the presence of M. Dumas, who assisted us in our endeavour, cells of\r\nyeast in the grapes; but it was quite impossible to discover any.[123]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this result, we undertook fresh experiments on grapes, on\r\na melon, on oranges, on plums, and on rhubarb leaves, gathered in the\r\ngarden of the _École Normale_, and, in every case, our substance when\r\nimmersed in carbonic acid gas, gave rise to the production of alcohol\r\nand carbonic acid. We obtained the following surprising results from\r\nsome _prunes de Monsieur_[124]:—On July 31st, 1872, we placed\r\ntwenty-four of these plums under a glass cylinder, which we immediately\r\nfilled with carbonic acid gas. The plums had been gathered on the\r\nprevious day. By the side of the cylinder we placed other twenty-four\r\nplums, which were left there uncovered. Eight days afterwards, in the\r\ncourse of which time there had been a considerable evolution of carbonic\r\nacid from the cylinder, we withdrew the plums and compared them with\r\nthose which had been left exposed to the air. The difference was\r\nstriking, almost incredible. Whilst the plums which had been surrounded\r\nwith air (the experiments of Bérard have long since taught us that,\r\nunder this latter condition, fruits absorb oxygen from the air and emit\r\ncarbonic acid gas in almost equal volume) had become very soft and\r\nwatery and sweet, the plums taken from under the jar had remained very\r\nfirm and hard, the flesh was by no means watery, but they had lost much\r\nsugar. Lastly, when submitted to distillation, after crushing, they\r\nyielded 6·5 grammes (99·7 grains) of alcohol, more than 1 per cent. of\r\nthe total weight of the plums. What better proof could we have than\r\nthese facts of the existence of a considerable chemical action in the\r\ninterior of fruit, an action which derives the heat necessary for its\r\nmanifestation from the decomposition of the sugar present in the cells?\r\nMoreover, and this circumstance is especially worthy of our attention,\r\nin all these experiments we found that there was a liberation of heat,\r\nof which the fruits and other organs were the seat, as soon as they were\r\nplunged in the carbonic acid gas. This heat is so considerable that it\r\nmay at times be detected by the hand, if the two sides of the cylinder,\r\none of which is in contact with the objects, are touched alternately. It\r\nalso makes itself evident in the formation of vapour, which condenses in\r\nlittle drops on those parts of the bell which are less directly exposed\r\nto the influence of the heat resulting from the decomposition of the\r\nsugar of the cells.[125]\r\n\r\nIn short, fermentation is a very general phenomenon. It is life without\r\nair, or life without free oxygen, or, more generally still, it is the\r\nresult of a chemical process accomplished on a fermentable substance,\r\n_i.e._ a substance capable of producing heat by its decomposition, in\r\nwhich process the entire heat used up is derived from a part of the heat\r\nthat the decomposition of the fermentable substance sets free. The class\r\nof fermentations, properly so called, is, however, restricted by the\r\nsmall number of substances capable of decomposing with the production of\r\nheat, and at the same time of serving for the nourishment of lower forms\r\nof life, when deprived of the presence and action of air. This, again,\r\nis a consequence of our theory, which is well worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nThe facts that we have just mentioned in reference to the formation of\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid in the substance of ripe fruits, under certain\r\nspecial conditions, and apart from the action of ferment, are already\r\nknown to science. They were discovered in 1869 by M. Lechartier,\r\nformerly a pupil in the _École Normale Supérieure_, and his coadjutor,\r\nM. Bellamy.[126] In 1821, in a very remarkable work, especially when we\r\nconsider the period when it appeared, Bérard demonstrated several\r\nimportant propositions in connection with the maturation of fruits:—\r\n\r\nI. All fruits, even those that are still green, and likewise even those\r\nthat are exposed to the sun, absorb oxygen and set free an almost equal\r\nvolume of carbonic acid gas. This is a condition of their proper\r\nripening.\r\n\r\nII. Ripe fruits placed in a limited atmosphere, after having absorbed\r\nall the oxygen and set free an almost equal volume of carbonic acid,\r\ncontinue to emit that gas in notable quantity, even when no bruise is to\r\nbe seen—“as though by a kind of fermentation,” as Bérard actually\r\nobserves—and lose their saccharine particles, a circumstance which\r\ncauses the fruits to appear more acid, although the actual weight of\r\ntheir acid may undergo no augmentation whatever.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful work, and in all subsequent ones of which the ripening\r\nof fruits has been the subject, two facts of great theoretical value\r\nhave escaped the notice of the authors; these are the two facts which\r\nMessrs. Lechartier and Bellamy pointed out, for the first time, namely,\r\nthe production of alcohol and the absence of cells of ferments. It is\r\nworthy of remark that these two facts, as we have shown above, were\r\nactually foreshadowed in the theory of fermentation that we advocated as\r\nfar back as 1861, and we are happy to add that Messrs. Lechartier and\r\nBellamy, who, at first, had prudently drawn no theoretical conclusions\r\nfrom their work, now entirely agree with the theory we have\r\nadvanced.[127] Their mode of reasoning is very different from that of\r\nthe savants with whom we discussed the subject before the Academy, on\r\nthe occasion when the communication which we addressed to the Academy,\r\nin October, 1872, attracted attention once more to the remarkable\r\nobservations of Messrs. Lechartier and Bellamy.[128] M. Fremy, in\r\nparticular, was desirous of finding in those observations a confirmation\r\nof his views on the subject of _hemi-organism_, and a condemnation of\r\nours, notwithstanding the fact that the preceding explanations and, more\r\nparticularly our Note of 1861, which we have quoted word for word in the\r\nlast paragraph, furnish the most conclusive evidence in favour of those\r\nideas which we advocate. Indeed, as far back as 1861 we pointed out very\r\nclearly that if we could find plants able to live when deprived of air,\r\nin the presence of sugar, they would bring about a fermentation of that\r\nsubstance, in the same manner as yeast does. Such is the case with the\r\nfungi already studied in Chapter IV.; such, too, is the case with the\r\nfruits employed in the experiments of Messrs. Lechartier and Bellamy,\r\nand in our own experiments, the results of which not only confirm those\r\nobtained by these gentlemen, but even extend them, in so far as we have\r\nshown that fruits, when surrounded with carbonic acid gas, immediately\r\nproduce alcohol. When surrounded with air, they live in their aërobian\r\nstate, and we have no ferment-action; immersed immediately afterwards in\r\ncarbonic acid gas, they now assume their anaërobian state, and at once\r\nbegin to act upon the sugar in the manner of ferments, and emit heat. As\r\nfor seeing in these facts anything like a confirmation of the theory of\r\nhemi-organism, imagined by M. Fremy, the idea of such a thing is absurd.\r\nThe following, for instance, is the theory of the fermentation of the\r\nvintage, according to M. Fremy.[129]\r\n\r\n“To speak here of alcoholic fermentation alone,”[130] our author says,\r\n“I hold that in the production of wine it is the juice of the fruit\r\nitself that, in contact with air, produces grains of ferment, by the\r\ntransformation of the albuminous matter; M. Pasteur, on the other hand,\r\nmaintains that the fermentation is produced by germs existing outside\r\nthe skin of the grapes.”\r\n\r\nNow what bearing on this purely imaginary theory can the fact have, that\r\na whole fruit, immersed in carbonic acid gas, immediately produces\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid? In the preceding passage, which we have\r\nborrowed from M. Fremy, an indispensable condition of the transformation\r\nof the albuminous matter is the contact with air and the crushing of the\r\ngrapes. Here, however, we are dealing with _uninjured fruits in contact\r\nwith carbonic acid gas_. Our theory, on the other hand, which, we may\r\nrepeat, we have advocated since 1861, maintains that all cells become\r\nfermentative when their vital action is protracted in the absence of\r\nair, which are precisely the conditions that hold in the experiment on\r\nfruits immersed in carbonic acid gas. The vital energy is not\r\nimmediately suspended in their cells, and the latter are deprived of\r\nair. Consequently, fermentation must result. Moreover, we may add, if we\r\ndestroy the fruit, or crush it before immersing it in the gas, it no\r\nlonger produces alcohol or fermentation of any kind, a circumstance that\r\nmay be attributed to the fact of the destruction of vital action in the\r\ncrushed fruit. On the other hand, in what way ought this crushing to\r\naffect the hypothesis of hemi-organism? The crushed fruit ought to act\r\nquite as well, or even better than that which is uncrushed. In short,\r\nnothing can be more directly opposed to the theory of the mode of\r\nmanifestation of that hidden force to which the name of hemi-organism\r\nhas been given, than the discovery of the production of these phenomena\r\nof fermentation in fruits surrounded with carbonic acid gas; whilst the\r\ntheory, which sees in fermentation a consequence of vital energy in\r\nabsence of air, finds in these facts the strictest confirmation of an\r\nexpress prediction, which from the first formed an integral part of its\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nWe should not be justified in devoting further time to opinions which\r\nare not supported by any serious experiment. Abroad, as well as in\r\nFrance, the theory of the transformation of albuminous substances into\r\norganized ferments had been advocated long before it was taken up by M.\r\nFremy. It no longer commands the slightest credit, nor do any observers\r\nof note any longer give it the least attention; it might even be said\r\nthat it has become a subject of ridicule.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has also been made to prove that we have contradicted\r\nourselves, inasmuch as in 1860 we published our opinion that alcoholic\r\nfermentation can never occur without a simultaneous occurrence of\r\norganization, development, and multiplication of globules; or continued\r\nlife, carried on from globules already formed.[131] Nothing, however,\r\ncan be truer than that opinion, and at the present moment, after fifteen\r\nyears of study devoted to the subject, since the publication to which we\r\nhave referred, we need no longer say “we think,” but instead, “we\r\naffirm” that it is correct. It is, as a matter of fact, to alcoholic\r\nfermentation, properly so called, that the charge to which we have\r\nreferred relates—to that fermentation which yields, besides alcohol,\r\ncarbonic acid, succinic acid, glycerine, volatile acids, and other\r\nproducts. This fermentation undoubtedly requires the presence of\r\nyeast-cells, under the conditions that we have named. Those who have\r\ncontradicted us have fallen into the error of supposing that the\r\nfermentation of fruits is an ordinary alcoholic fermentation, identical\r\nwith that produced by beer-yeast, and that, consequently, the cells of\r\nthat yeast must, according to our own theory, be always present. There\r\nis not the least authority for such a supposition. When we come to exact\r\nquantitative estimations—and these are to be found in the figures\r\nsupplied by Messrs. Lechartier and Bellamy—it will be seen that the\r\nproportions of alcohol and carbonic acid gas produced in the\r\nfermentation of fruits differ widely from those that we find in\r\nalcoholic fermentations, properly so called, as must necessarily be the\r\ncase, since, in the former, the ferment-action is effected by the cells\r\nof a fruit, but in the latter by cells of ordinary alcoholic ferment.\r\nIndeed we have a strong conviction that each fruit would be found to\r\ngive rise to a special action, the chemical equation of which would be\r\ndifferent from that in the case of other fruits. As for the circumstance\r\nthat the cells of these fruits cause fermentation, without multiplying,\r\nthis comes under the kind of activity, which we have already\r\ndistinguished by the expression _continuous life in cells already\r\nformed_.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this paragraph with a few remarks on the subject of the\r\nequations of fermentations, which have been suggested to us principally\r\nin attempts to explain the results derived from the fermentation of\r\nfruits immersed in carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nOriginally, when fermentations were put amongst the class of\r\ndecompositions by contact-action, it seemed probable, and, in fact, was\r\nbelieved, that every fermentation had its own well-defined equation,\r\nwhich never varied. In the present day, on the contrary, it must be\r\nborne in mind that the equation of a fermentation varies essentially\r\nwith the conditions under which that fermentation is accomplished, and\r\nthat a statement of this equation is a problem no less complicated than\r\nthat in the case of the nutrition of a living being. To every\r\nfermentation may be assigned an equation in a general sort of way, an\r\nequation, however, which, in numerous points of detail, is liable to the\r\nthousand variations connected with the phenomena of life. Moreover,\r\nthere will be as many distinct fermentations brought about by one\r\nferment as there are fermentable substances capable of supplying the\r\ncarbon element of the food of that same ferment, in the same way that\r\nthe equation of the nutrition of an animal will vary with the nature of\r\nthe food which it consumes. As regards fermentation producing alcohol,\r\nwhich may be effected by several different ferments, there will be, in\r\nthe case of a given sugar, as many general equations as there are\r\nferments, whether they be ferment-cells, properly so called, or cells of\r\nthe organs of living beings functioning as ferments. In the same way the\r\nequation of nutrition varies in the case of different animals nourished\r\non the same food. And it is from the same reason that ordinary wort\r\nproduces such a variety of beers when treated with the numerous\r\nalcoholic ferments which we have described. These remarks are applicable\r\nto all ferments alike; for instance, butyric ferment is capable of\r\nproducing a host of distinct fermentations, in consequence of its\r\nability to derive the carbonaceous part of its food from very different\r\nsubstances, from sugar, or lactic acid, or glycerine, or mannite, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that every fermentation has its own peculiar ferment, it\r\nmust be understood that we are speaking of the fermentation considered\r\nas a whole, including all the accessory products. We do not mean to\r\nimply that the ferment in question is not capable of acting on some\r\nother fermentable substance and giving rise to fermentation of a very\r\ndifferent kind. Moreover, it is quite erroneous to suppose that the\r\npresence of a single one of the products of a fermentation implies the\r\nco-existence of a particular ferment. If, for example, we find alcohol\r\namong the products of a fermentation, or even alcohol and carbonic acid\r\ngas together, this does not prove that the ferment must be an alcoholic\r\nferment, belonging to alcoholic fermentations, in the strict sense of\r\nthe term. Nor, again, does the mere presence of lactic acid necessarily\r\nimply the presence of lactic ferment. As a matter of fact, different\r\nfermentations may give rise to one or even several identical products.\r\nWe could not say with certainty, from a purely chemical point of view,\r\nthat we were dealing, for example, with an alcoholic fermentation,\r\nproperly so called, and that the yeast of beer must be present in it, if\r\nwe had not first determined the presence of all the numerous products of\r\nthat particular fermentation, and that they were present in those\r\nproportions, characteristic of that fermentation under conditions\r\nsimilar to those under which the fermentation in question had occurred.\r\nIn works on fermentation, the reader will often find those confusions\r\nagainst which we are now attempting to guard him. It is precisely in\r\nconsequence of not having had their attention drawn to such observations\r\nthat some have imagined that the fermentation in fruits, immersed in\r\ncarbonic acid gas, is in contradiction to the assertion which we\r\noriginally made in our Memoir on alcoholic fermentation, published in\r\n1860, the exact words of which we may here repeat:—“The chemical\r\nphenomena of fermentation are related essentially to a vital activity,\r\nbeginning and ending with the latter; we believe that alcoholic\r\nfermentation never occurs”—we were discussing the question of ordinary\r\nalcoholic fermentation produced by the yeast of beer—“without the\r\nsimultaneous occurrence of organization, development, and multiplication\r\nof globules, or continued life, carried on by means of globules already\r\nformed. The general results of the present Memoir seem to us to be in\r\ndirect opposition to the opinions of MM. Liebig and Berzelius.” These\r\nconclusions, we repeat, are as true now as they ever were, and are as\r\napplicable to the fermentation of fruits, of which nothing was known in\r\n1860, as they are to the fermentation produced by means of yeast. Only,\r\nin the case of fruits, it is the cells of the parenchyma that function\r\nas ferment, _by a continuation of their vital activity in carbonic acid\r\ngas_, whilst in the other case the ferment consists of the cells of\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\nThere should be nothing very surprising in the fact that fermentation\r\ncan originate in fruits and form alcohol, without the presence of yeast,\r\nif the fermentation of fruits were not confounded completely with\r\nordinary alcoholic fermentation, yielding the same products and in the\r\nsame proportions. It is through the misuse of words that the\r\nfermentation of fruits has been termed _alcoholic_, in a way which has\r\nmisled many persons.[132] In this fermentation, neither alcohol nor\r\ncarbonic acid gas exists in those proportions in which they are found in\r\nfermentations produced by yeast; and although we may determine in it the\r\npresence of succinic acid, glycerine, and a small quantity of volatile\r\nacids,[133] the relative proportions of these substances will be\r\ndifferent from what they are in the case of alcoholic fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III.—Reply to certain Critical Observations of the German Naturalists,\r\n                    Oscar Brefeld and Moritz Traube.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential point of the theory of fermentation, which we have been\r\nconcerned in proving in preceding paragraphs, may be briefly put in the\r\nstatement that ferments, properly so called, constitute a class of\r\nbeings possessing the faculty of living out of contact with free oxygen;\r\nor, more concisely still, we may say, fermentation is a result of life\r\nwithout air.\r\n\r\nIf our affirmation were inexact, if ferment-cells did require for their\r\ngrowth or for their increase in number or weight, as all other vegetable\r\ncells do, the presence of oxygen, whether gaseous or held in solution in\r\nliquids, this new theory would lose all value, its very _raison d’être_\r\nwould be gone, at least as far as the most important part of\r\nfermentations is concerned. This is precisely what M. Oscar Brefeld has\r\nendeavoured to prove, in a Memoir read to the Physico-Medical Society of\r\nWurzburg, on July 26th, 1873, in which, although we have ample evidence\r\nof the great experimental skill of its author, he has, nevertheless, in\r\nour opinion, arrived at conclusions entirely opposed to fact.\r\n\r\n“From the experiments which I have just described,” he says, “it\r\nfollows, in the most indisputable manner, that _a ferment cannot\r\nincrease without free oxygen_. Pasteur’s supposition that a ferment,\r\nunlike all other living organisms, can live and increase at the expense\r\nof oxygen held in combination, is, consequently, altogether wanting in\r\nany solid basis of experimental proof. Moreover, since, according to the\r\ntheory of Pasteur, it is precisely this faculty of living and increasing\r\nat the expense of the oxygen held in combination that constitutes the\r\nphenomenon of fermentation, it follows that the whole theory, commanding\r\nthough it does such general assent, is shown to be untenable; it is\r\nsimply inaccurate.”\r\n\r\nThe experiments to which Dr. Brefeld alludes, consisted in keeping under\r\ncontinued study with the microscope, in a room specially prepared for\r\nthe purpose, one or more cells of ferment in wort, in an atmosphere of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, free from the least traces of free oxygen. We have,\r\nhowever, recognized the fact that the increase of a ferment out of\r\ncontact with air is only possible in the case of a very young specimen;\r\nbut our author employed brewer’s yeast taken after fermentation, and to\r\nthis fact we may attribute the non-success of his growths. Dr. Brefeld,\r\nwithout knowing it, operated on yeast in one of the states in which it\r\nrequires gaseous oxygen to enable it to germinate again. A perusal of\r\nwhat we have previously written on the subject of the revival of yeast,\r\naccording to its age, will show how widely the time required for such\r\nrevival may vary in different cases. What may be perfectly true of the\r\nstate of a yeast to-day may not be so to-morrow, since yeast is\r\ncontinually undergoing modifications. We have already shown the energy\r\nand activity with which a ferment can vegetate in the presence of free\r\noxygen, and we have pointed out the great extent to which a very small\r\nquantity of oxygen held in solution in fermenting liquids can operate at\r\nthe beginning of fermentation. It is this oxygen that produces revival\r\nin the cells of the ferment and enables them to resume the faculty of\r\ngerminating and continuing their life, and of multiplying when deprived\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, a simple reflection should have guarded Dr. Brefeld\r\nagainst the interpretation which he has attached to his observations. If\r\na cell of ferment cannot bud or increase without absorbing oxygen,\r\neither free or held in solution in the liquid, the ratio between the\r\nweight of ferment formed during fermentation and that of oxygen used up\r\nmust be constant. We had, however, clearly established, as far back as\r\n1861, the fact that this ratio is extremely variable, a fact, moreover,\r\nwhich is placed beyond doubt by the experiments described in the\r\npreceding paragraph. Though but small quantities of oxygen are absorbed,\r\na considerable weight of ferment may be generated; whilst if the ferment\r\nhas abundance of oxygen at its disposal, it will absorb much, and the\r\nweight of yeast formed will be still greater. The ratio between the\r\nweight of ferment formed and that of sugar decomposed may pass through\r\nall stages between certain very wide limits, the variations depending on\r\nthe greater or less absorption of free oxygen. And in this fact, we\r\nbelieve, lies one of the most essential supports of the theory which we\r\nadvocate. In denouncing the impossibility, as he considered it, of a\r\nferment living without air or oxygen, and so acting in defiance of that\r\nlaw which governs all living beings, animal or vegetable, Dr. Brefeld\r\nought also to have borne in mind the fact which we have pointed out,\r\nthat alcoholic yeast is not the only organized ferment which lives in an\r\nanaërobian state. It is really a small matter that one more ferment\r\nshould be placed in a list of exceptions to the generality of living\r\nbeings, for whom there is a rigid law in their vital economy which\r\nrequires for continued life a continuous respiration, a continuous\r\nsupply of free oxygen. Why, for instance, has Dr. Brefeld omitted the\r\nfacts bearing on the life of the vibrios of butyric fermentation?\r\nDoubtless he thought we were equally mistaken in these: a few actual\r\nexperiments would have put him right.\r\n\r\nThese remarks on the criticisms of Dr. Brefeld are also applicable to\r\ncertain observations of M. Moritz Traube’s, although, as regards the\r\nprincipal object of Dr. Brefeld’s attack, we are indebted to M. Traube\r\nfor our defence. This gentleman maintained the exactness of our results\r\nbefore the Chemical Society of Berlin, proving by fresh experiments that\r\nyeast is able to live and multiply without the intervention of oxygen.\r\n“My researches,” he said, “confirm in an indisputable manner M.\r\nPasteur’s assertion that the multiplication of yeast can take place in\r\nmedia which contain no trace of free oxygen.... M. Brefeld’s assertion\r\nto the contrary is erroneous.” But, immediately afterwards, M. Traube\r\nadds: “Have we here a confirmation of Pasteur’s theory? By no means. The\r\nresults of my experiments demonstrate, on the contrary, that this theory\r\nhas no sure foundation.” What were these results? Whilst proving that\r\nyeast could live without air, M. Traube, as we ourselves did, found that\r\nit had great difficulty in living under these conditions; indeed he\r\nnever succeeded in obtaining more than the first stages of true\r\nfermentation. This was doubtless for the two following reasons—first, in\r\nconsequence of the accidental production of secondary and diseased\r\nfermentations, which frequently prevent the propagation of alcoholic\r\nferment; and, secondly, in consequence of the original exhausted\r\ncondition of the yeast employed. As long ago as 1861 we pointed out the\r\nslowness and difficulty of the vital action of yeast when deprived of\r\nair, and a little way back, in the preceding paragraph, we have called\r\nattention to certain fermentations that cannot be completed under such\r\nconditions without going into the causes of these peculiarities. M.\r\nTraube expresses himself thus: “Pasteur’s conclusion, that yeast in the\r\nabsence of air is able to derive the oxygen necessary for its\r\ndevelopment from sugar, is erroneous; its increase is arrested, even\r\nwhen the greater part of the sugar still remains undecomposed. _It is in\r\na mixture of albuminous substances that yeast, when deprived of air,\r\nfinds the materials for its development._” This last assertion of M.\r\nTraube’s is entirely disproved by those fermentation experiments in\r\nwhich, after suppressing the presence of albuminous substances, the\r\naction, nevertheless, went on in a purely inorganic medium, out of\r\ncontact with air, a fact of which we shall give irrefutable proofs.[134]\r\n\r\n\r\n          § IV.—Fermentation of Dextro-Tartrate of Lime.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\nTartrate of lime, in spite of its insolubility in water, is capable of\r\ncomplete fermentation in a mineral medium.\r\n\r\nIf we put some pure tartrate of lime, in the form of a granulated,\r\ncrystalline powder, into pure water, together with some sulphate of\r\nammonia and phosphates of potassium and magnesium, in very small\r\nproportions, a spontaneous fermentation will take place in the deposit\r\nin the course of a few days, although no germs of ferment have been\r\nadded. A living, organized ferment, of the vibrionic type, filiform,\r\nwith tortuous motions, and often of immense length, forms spontaneously\r\nby the development of some germs derived in some way from the inevitable\r\nparticles of dust floating in the air or resting on the surface of the\r\nvessels or materials which we employ. The germs of the vibrios concerned\r\nin putrefaction are diffused around us on every side, and, in all\r\nprobability, it is one or more of these germs that develop in the medium\r\nin question. In this way they effect the decomposition of the tartrate,\r\nfrom which they must necessarily obtain the carbon of their food,\r\nwithout which they cannot exist, while the nitrogen is furnished by the\r\nammonia of the ammoniacal salt, the mineral principles by the phosphate\r\nof potassium and magnesium, and the sulphur by the sulphate of ammonia.\r\nHow strange to see organization, life, and motion originating under such\r\nconditions! Stranger still to think that this organization, life, and\r\nmotion are effected without the participation of free oxygen. Once the\r\ngerm gets a primary impulse on its living career by access of oxygen, it\r\ngoes on reproducing indefinitely, absolutely without atmospheric air.\r\nHere then we have a fact which it is important to establish beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt, that we may prove that yeast is not the only\r\norganized ferment able to live and multiply when out of the influence of\r\nfree oxygen.\r\n\r\nInto a flask, like that represented in Fig. 67, of 2·5 litres (about\r\nfour pints) in capacity, we put:—\r\n\r\n         Pure, crystallized, neutral tartrate of  100 grammes.\r\n         lime\r\n\r\n         Phosphate of ammonia                        1 gramme.\r\n\r\n         Phosphate of magnesium                      1 gramme.\r\n\r\n         Phosphate of potassium                    0·5 gramme.\r\n\r\n         Sulphate of ammonia                       0·5 gramme.\r\n\r\n         (1 gramme=15·43 grains.)\r\n\r\nTo this we added pure distilled water, so as to entirely fill the flask.\r\n\r\nIn order to expel all the air dissolved in the water and adhering to the\r\nsolid substances, we first placed our flask in a bath of chloride of\r\ncalcium, in a large cylindrical white iron pot, set over a flame. The\r\nexit-tube of the flask was plunged in a test-tube of Bohemian glass\r\nthree-quarters full of distilled water, and also heated by a flame. We\r\nboiled the liquids in the flask and test-tube for a sufficient time to\r\nexpel all the air contained in them. We then withdrew the heat from\r\nunder the test-tube, and immediately afterwards covered the water which\r\nit contained with a layer of oil, and then permitted the whole apparatus\r\nto cool down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nNext day we applied a finger to the open extremity of the exit-tube,\r\nwhich we then plunged in a vessel of mercury. In this particular\r\nexperiment which we are describing, we permitted the flask to remain in\r\nthis state for a fortnight. It might have remained for a century without\r\never manifesting the least sign of fermentation, the fermentation of the\r\ntartrate being a consequence of life, and life after the boiling no\r\nlonger existed in the flask. When it was evident that the contents of\r\nthe flask were perfectly inert, we impregnated them rapidly, as\r\nfollows:—All the liquid contained in the exit-tube was removed by means\r\nof a fine caoutchouc tube, and replaced by about 1 c.c. (about 17\r\nminims) of liquid and deposit from another flask, similar to the one we\r\nhave described, but which had been fermenting spontaneously for twelve\r\ndays; we lost no time in refilling completely the exit-tube with water\r\nwhich had been first boiled and then cooled down in carbonic acid gas.\r\nThis operation lasted only a few minutes. The exit-tube was again\r\nplunged under mercury. Subsequently the tube was not moved from under\r\nthe mercury, and as it formed part of the flask, and there was neither\r\ncork nor india-rubber, any introduction of air was consequently\r\nimpossible. The small quantity of air introduced during the impregnation\r\nwas insignificant, and it might even be shown that it injured rather\r\nthan assisted the growth of the organisms, inasmuch as these consisted\r\nof adult individuals which had lived without air and might be liable to\r\nbe damaged or even destroyed by it. Be this as it may, in a subsequent\r\nexperiment we shall find the possibility removed of any aeration taking\r\nplace in this way, however infinitesimal, so that no doubt may linger on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe following days the organisms multiplied, the deposit of tartrate\r\ngradually disappeared, and a sensible ferment action was manifest on the\r\nsurface, and throughout the bulk of the liquid. The deposit seemed\r\nlifted up in places, and was covered with a layer of a dark-grey colour,\r\npuffed up, and having an organic and gelatinous appearance. For several\r\ndays, in spite of this action in the deposit, we detected no\r\ndisengagement of gas, except when the flask was slightly shaken, in\r\nwhich case rather large bubbles adhering to the deposit rose, carrying\r\nwith them some solid particles, which quickly fell back again, whilst\r\nthe bubbles diminished in size as they rose, from being partially taken\r\ninto solution, in consequence of the liquid not being saturated. The\r\nsmallest bubbles had even time to dissolve completely before they could\r\nreach the surface of the liquid. In course of time the liquid was\r\nsaturated, and the tartrate was gradually displaced by mammillated\r\ncrusts, or clear, transparent crystals of carbonate of lime at the\r\nbottom and on the sides of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe impregnation took place on February 10th, and on March 15th the\r\nliquid was nearly saturated. The bubbles then began to lodge in the bent\r\npart of the exit-tube, at the top of the flask. A glass measuring-tube\r\ncontaining mercury was now placed with its open end over the point of\r\nthe exit-tube under the mercury in the trough, so that no bubble might\r\nescape. A steady evolution of gas went on from the 17th to the 18th,\r\n17·4 c.c. (1·06 cubic inches) having been collected. This was proved to\r\nbe nearly absolutely pure carbonic acid, as indeed might have been\r\nsuspected from the fact that the evolution did not begin before a\r\ndistinct saturation of the liquid was observed.[136]\r\n\r\nThe liquid, which was turbid on the day after its impregnation, had, in\r\nspite of the liberation of gas, again become so transparent that we\r\ncould read our handwriting through the body of the flask.\r\nNotwithstanding this, there was still a very active operation going on\r\nin the deposit, but it was confined to that spot. Indeed, the swarming\r\nvibrios were bound to remain there, the tartrate of lime being still\r\nmore insoluble in water saturated with carbonate of lime than it is in\r\npure water. A supply of carbonaceous food, at all events, was absolutely\r\nwanting in the bulk of the liquid. Every day we continued to collect and\r\nanalyze the total amount of gas disengaged. To the very last, it was\r\ncomposed of pure carbonic acid gas. Only during the first few days did\r\nthe absorption by the concentrated potash leave a very minute residue.\r\nBy April 26th all liberation of gas had ceased, the last bubbles having\r\nrisen in the course of April 23rd. The flask had been all the time in\r\nthe oven, at a temperature between 25° C. and 28° C. (77° F. and 83°\r\nF.). The total volume of gas collected was 2·135 litres (130·2 cubic\r\ninches). To obtain the whole volume of gas formed we had to add to this\r\nwhat was held in the liquid in the state of acid carbonate of lime. To\r\ndetermine this we poured a portion of the liquid from the flask into\r\nanother flask of similar shape, but smaller, up to a gauge-mark on the\r\nneck.[137] This smaller flask had been previously filled with carbonic\r\nacid. The carbonic acid of the fermented liquid was then expelled by\r\nmeans of heat, and collected over mercury. In this way we found a volume\r\nof 8·322 litres (508 cubic inches) of gas in solution, which, added to\r\n2·135 litres, gave a total of 10·457 litres (638·2 cubic inches) at 20°\r\nand 760, which calculated to 0° C. and 760 mm. atmospheric pressure (32°\r\nF. and 30 inches) gave a weight of 19·70 grammes (302·2 grains) of\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nExactly half of the lime of the tartrate employed got used up in the\r\nsoluble salts formed during fermentation; the other half was partly\r\nprecipitated in the form of carbonate of lime, partly dissolved in the\r\nliquid by the carbonic acid. The soluble salts seemed to us to be a\r\nmixture or combination of 1 equivalent of metacetate of lime, with 2\r\nequivalents of the acetate, for every 10 equivalents of carbonic acid\r\nproduced, the whole corresponding to the fermentation of 3 equivalents\r\nof neutral tartrate of lime.[138] This point, however, is worthy of\r\nbeing studied with greater care: the present statement of the nature of\r\nthe products formed is given with all reserve. For our point, indeed,\r\nthe matter is of little importance, since the equation of the\r\nfermentation does not concern us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of fermentation there was not a trace of tartrate\r\nof lime remaining at the bottom of the vessel: it had disappeared\r\ngradually as it got broken up into the different products of\r\nfermentation, and its place was taken by some crystallized carbonate of\r\nlime—the excess, namely, which had been unable to dissolve by the action\r\nof the carbonic acid. Associated, moreover, with this carbonate of lime\r\nthere was a quantity of some kind of animal matter, which, under the\r\nmicroscope, appeared to be composed of masses of granules mixed with\r\nvery fine filaments of varying lengths, studded with minute dots, and\r\npresenting all the characteristics of a nitrogenous organic\r\nsubstance.[139] That this was really the ferment is evident enough from\r\nall that we have already said. To convince ourselves more thoroughly of\r\nthe fact, and at the same time to enable us to observe the mode of\r\nactivity of the organism, we instituted the following supplementary\r\nobservation. Side by side with the experiment just described, we\r\nconducted a similar one, which we intermitted after the fermentation was\r\nsomewhat advanced, and about half of the tartrate dissolved. Breaking\r\noff, with a file, the exit tube at the point where the neck began to\r\nnarrow off, we took some of the deposit from the bottom by means of a\r\nlong, straight piece of tubing, in order to bring it under microscopical\r\nexamination. We found it to consist of a host of long filaments of\r\nextreme tenuity, their diameter being about 1/1000th of a millimetre\r\n(0·000039 in.); their length varied, in some cases being as much as\r\n1/20th of a millimetre (0·0019 in.). A crowd of these long vibrios were\r\nto be seen creeping slowly along, with a sinuous movement, showing\r\nthree, four, or even five flexures. The filaments that were at rest had\r\nthe same aspect as these last, with the exception that they appeared\r\npunctate, as though composed of a series of granules arranged in\r\nirregular order. No doubt these were vibrios in which vital action had\r\nceased, exhausted specimens which we may compare with the old granular\r\nferment of beer, whilst those in motion may be compared with young and\r\nvigorous yeast. The absence of movement in the former seems to prove\r\nthat this view is correct. Both kinds showed a tendency to form\r\nclusters, the compactness of which impeded the movements of those which\r\nwere in motion. Moreover, it was noticeable that the masses of these\r\nlatter rested on tartrate not yet dissolved, whilst the granular\r\nclusters of the others rested directly on the glass, at the bottom of\r\nthe flask, as if, having decomposed the tartrate, the only carbonaceous\r\nfood at their disposal, they had then died at the spot where we captured\r\nthem from inability to escape, precisely in consequence of that state of\r\nentanglement which they combined to form, during the period of their\r\nactive development. Besides these we observed vibrios of the same\r\ndiameter, but of much smaller length, whirling round with great\r\nrapidity, and darting backwards and forwards; these were probably\r\nidentical with the longer ones, and possessed greater freedom of\r\nmovement, no doubt in consequence of their greater shortness. Not one of\r\nthese vibrios could be found throughout the mass of the liquid.\r\n\r\nWe may remark that as there was a somewhat putrid odour from the deposit\r\nin which the vibrios swarmed, the action must have been one of\r\nreduction, and no doubt to this fact was due the greyish coloration of\r\nthe deposit. We suppose that the substances employed, however pure,\r\nalways contain some trace of iron, which becomes converted into the\r\nsulphide, the black colour of which would modify the originally white\r\ndeposit of insoluble tartrate and phosphate.\r\n\r\nBut what is the nature of these vibrios? We have already said that we\r\nbelieve that they are nothing but the ordinary vibrios of putrefaction,\r\nreduced to a state of extreme tenuity by the special conditions of\r\nnutrition involved in the fermentable medium used; in a word, we think\r\nthat the fermentation in question might be called putrefaction of\r\ntartrate of lime. It would be easy enough to determine this point by\r\ngrowing the vibrios of such a fermentation in media adapted to the\r\nproduction of the ordinary forms of vibrio; but this is an experiment\r\nwhich we have not ourselves tried.\r\n\r\nOne word more on the subject of these curious beings. In a great many of\r\nthem there appears to be something like a clear spot, a kind of bead, at\r\none of their extremities. This is an illusion arising from the fact that\r\nthe extremity of these vibrios is curved, hanging downwards, thus\r\ncausing a greater refraction at that particular point, and leading us to\r\nthink that the diameter is greater at that extremity. We may easily\r\nundeceive ourselves if we watch the movements of the vibrio, when we\r\nwill readily recognize the bend, especially as it is brought into the\r\nvertical plane passing over the rest of the filament. In this way we\r\nwill see the bright spot, the head disappear, and then reappear.\r\n\r\nThe chief inference that it concerns us to draw from the preceding facts\r\nis one which cannot admit of doubt, and which we need not insist on any\r\nfurther—namely, that vibrios, as met with in the fermentation of neutral\r\ntartrate of lime, are able to live and multiply when entirely deprived\r\nof air.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § V.—Another Example of Life Without Air—Fermentation of Lactate of\r\n                                 Lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs another example of life without air, accompanied by fermentation\r\nproperly so called, we may lastly cite the fermentation of lactate of\r\nlime in a mineral medium.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment described in the last paragraph, it will be remembered\r\nthat the ferment-liquid and the germs employed in its impregnation came\r\nin contact with air, although only for a very brief time. Now,\r\nnotwithstanding that we possess exact observations which prove that the\r\ndiffusion of oxygen and nitrogen in a liquid absolutely deprived of air,\r\nso far from taking place rapidly, is, on the contrary, a very slow\r\nprocess indeed; yet we were anxious to guard the experiment that we are\r\nabout to describe from the slightest possible trace of oxygen at the\r\nmoment of impregnation.\r\n\r\nWe employed a liquid prepared as follows: Into from 9 to 10 litres\r\n(somewhat over 2 gallons) of pure water the following salts[140] were\r\nintroduced successively, viz:—\r\n\r\n              Pure lactate of lime           225 grammes\r\n              Phosphate of ammonia           0·75 grammes\r\n              Phosphate of potassium         0·4 grammes\r\n              Sulphate of magnesium          0·4 grammes\r\n              Sulphate of ammonia            0·2 grammes\r\n              [1 gramme=15·43 grains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nOn March 23rd, 1875, we filled a 6 litre (about 11 pints) flask, of the\r\nshape represented in Fig. 69, and placed it over a heater. Another flame\r\nwas placed below a vessel containing the same liquid, into which the\r\ncurved tube of the flask was plunged. The liquids in the flask and in\r\nthe basin were raised to boiling together, and kept in this condition\r\nfor more than half-an-hour, so as to expel all the air held in solution.\r\nThe liquid was several times forced out of the flask by the steam, and\r\nsucked back again; but the portion which re-entered the flask was always\r\nboiling. On the following day, when the flask had cooled, we transferred\r\nthe end of the delivery tube to a vessel full of mercury and placed the\r\nwhole apparatus in an oven at a temperature varying between 25° C. and\r\n30° C. (77° F. and 86° F.); then, after having refilled the small\r\ncylindrical tap-funnel with carbonic acid, we passed into it with all\r\nnecessary precautions 10 c.c. (0·35 fl. oz.) of a liquid similar to that\r\ndescribed, which had been already in active fermentation for several\r\ndays out of contact with air and now swarmed with vibrios. We then\r\nturned the tap of the funnel, until only a small quantity of liquid was\r\nleft, just enough to prevent the access of air. In this way the\r\nimpregnation was accomplished without either the ferment-liquid or the\r\nferment-germs having been brought in contact, even for the shortest\r\nspace, with the external air. The fermentation, the occurrence of which\r\nat an earlier or later period depends for the most part on the condition\r\nof the impregnating germs, and the number introduced in the act, in this\r\ncase began to manifest itself by the appearance of minute bubbles from\r\nMarch 29th. But not till April 9th did we observe bubbles of larger size\r\nrise to the surface. From that date onward they continued to come in\r\nincreasing number, from certain points at the bottom of the flask, where\r\na deposit of earthy phosphates existed; and at the same time the liquid,\r\nwhich for the first few days remained perfectly clear, began to grow\r\nturbid in consequence of the development of vibrios. It was on the same\r\nday that we first observed a deposit on the sides of carbonate of lime\r\nin crystals.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of some interest to notice here that, in the mode of\r\nprocedure adopted, everything combined to prevent the interference of\r\nair. A portion of the liquid expelled at the beginning of the\r\nexperiment, partly because of the increased temperature in the oven and\r\npartly also by the force of the gas, as it began to be evolved from the\r\nfermentative action, reached the surface of the mercury, where, being\r\nthe most suitable medium we know for the growth of bacteria, it speedily\r\nswarmed with these organisms.[141] In this way any passage of air, if\r\nsuch a thing were possible, between the mercury and the sides of the\r\ndelivery-tube was altogether prevented, since the bacteria would consume\r\nevery trace of oxygen which might be dissolved in the liquid lying on\r\nthe surface of the mercury. Hence it is impossible to imagine that the\r\nslightest trace of oxygen could have got into the liquid in the flask.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on we may remark that in this ready absorption of oxygen\r\nby bacteria we have a means of depriving fermentable liquids of every\r\ntrace of that gas with a facility and success equal or even greater than\r\nby the method of preliminary boiling. Such a solution as we have\r\ndescribed, if kept at summer heat, without any previous boiling, becomes\r\nturbid in the course of twenty-four hours from a _spontaneous_\r\ndevelopment of bacteria; and it is easy to prove that they absorb all\r\nthe oxygen held in solution.[142] If we completely fill a flask of a few\r\nlitres capacity (about a gallon) (Fig. 67) with the liquid described,\r\ntaking care to have the delivery-tube also filled, and its opening\r\nplunged under mercury, and, forty-eight hours afterwards, by means of a\r\nchloride of calcium bath, expel from the liquid on the surface of the\r\nmercury all the gas which it holds in solution, this gas, when analyzed,\r\nwill be found to be composed of a mixture of nitrogen and carbonic acid\r\ngas, _without the least trace of oxygen_. Here, then, we have an\r\nexcellent means of depriving the fermentable liquid of air; we have\r\nsimply to completely fill a flask with the liquid, and place it in the\r\noven, merely avoiding any addition of butyric vibrios before the lapse\r\nof two or three days. We may wait even longer; and then, if the liquid\r\ndoes not become impregnated spontaneously with vibrio germs, the liquid,\r\nwhich at first was turbid from the presence of bacteria, will become\r\nbright again, since the bacteria when deprived of life, or, at least, of\r\nthe power of moving, after they have exhausted all the oxygen in\r\nsolution, will fall inert to the bottom of the vessel. On several\r\noccasions, we have determined this interesting fact, which tends to\r\nprove that the butyric vibrios cannot be regarded as another form of\r\nbacteria, inasmuch as, on the hypothesis of an original relation between\r\nthe two productions, butyric fermentation ought in every case to follow\r\nthe growth of bacteria.\r\n\r\nWe may also call attention to another striking experiment, well suited\r\nto show the effect of differences in the composition of the medium upon\r\nthe propagation of microscopic beings. The fermentation which we last\r\ndescribed commenced on March 27th and continued until May 10th; that to\r\nwhich we are now to refer, however, was completed in four days, the\r\nliquid employed being similar in composition and quantity to that\r\nemployed in the former experiment. On April 23rd, 1875, we filled a\r\nflask of the same shape as that represented in Fig. 69, and of similar\r\ncapacity, viz., 6 litres, with a liquid composed as described at page\r\n293. This liquid had been previously left to itself for five days in\r\nlarge open flasks, in consequence of which it had developed an abundant\r\ngrowth of bacteria. On the fifth day a few bubbles, rising from the\r\nbottom of the vessels, at long intervals, betokened the commencement of\r\nbutyric fermentation, a fact, moreover, confirmed by the microscope, in\r\nthe appearance of the vibrios of this fermentation in specimens of the\r\nliquid taken from the bottom of the vessels, the middle of its mass, and\r\neven in the layer on the surface that was swarming with bacteria. We\r\ntransferred the liquid so prepared to the 6-litre flask arranged over\r\nthe mercury. By evening a tolerably active fermentation had begun to\r\nmanifest itself. On the 24th this fermentation was proceeding with\r\nastonishing rapidity, which continued during the 25th and 26th. During\r\nthe evening of the 26th it slackened, and on the 27th all signs of\r\nfermentation had ceased. This was not, as might be supposed, a sudden\r\nstoppage, due to some unknown cause; the fermentation was actually\r\ncompleted, for when we examined the fermented liquid on the 28th we\r\ncould not find the smallest quantity of lactate of lime. If the needs of\r\nindustry should ever require the production of large quantities of\r\nbutyric acid, there would, beyond doubt, be found in the preceding fact\r\nvaluable information in devising an easy method of preparing that\r\nproduct in abundance.[143]\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further, let us devote some attention to the vibrios of\r\nthe preceding fermentations.\r\n\r\nOn May 27th, 1862, we completely filled a flask, capable of holding\r\n2·780 litres (about five pints), with the solution of lactate and\r\nphosphates.[144] We refrained from impregnating it with any germs. The\r\nliquid became turbid from a development of bacteria, and then underwent\r\nbutyric fermentation. By June 9th the fermentation had become\r\nsufficiently active to enable us to collect in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours, over mercury, as in all our experiments, about 100 cc. (about 6\r\ncubic inches) of gas. By June 11th, judging from the volume of gas\r\nliberated in the course of twenty-four hours, the activity of the\r\nfermentation had doubled. We examined a drop of the turbid liquid. Here\r\nare the notes accompanying the sketch (Fig. 70) as they stand in our\r\nnote-book:—“A swarm of vibrios, so active in their movements that the\r\neye has great difficulty in following them. They may be seen in pairs\r\nthroughout the field, apparently making efforts to separate from each\r\nother. The connection would seem to be by some invisible, gelatinous\r\nthread, which yields so far to their efforts that they succeed in\r\nbreaking away from actual contact, but yet are, for a while, so far\r\nrestrained that the movements of one have a visible effect on those of\r\nthe other. By and by, however, we see a complete separation effected,\r\nand each moves on its separate way with an activity still greater than\r\nit had before.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\nOne of the best methods that can be employed for the microscopical\r\nexamination of these vibrios, quite out of contact with air, is the\r\nfollowing:—After butyric fermentation has been going on for several days\r\nin a flask, A (Fig. 71), we connect this flask by an india-rubber tube\r\nwith one of the flattened bulbs previously described, page 156 (Fig.\r\n31), which we then place on the stage of the microscope (Fig. 71). When\r\nwe wish to make an observation we close, under the mercury, at the point\r\n_b_, the end of the drawn-out and bent delivery-tube. The continued\r\nevolution of gas soon exerts such a pressure within the flask, that when\r\nwe open the tap _r_, the liquid is driven into the bulb _l l_, until it\r\nbecomes quite full and the liquid flows over into the glass V. In this\r\nmanner we may bring the vibrios under observation without their coming\r\ninto contact with the least trace of air, and with as much success as if\r\nthe bulb, which takes the place of an object glass, had been plunged\r\ninto the very centre of the flask. The movements and fissiparous\r\nmultiplication of the vibrios may thus be seen in all their beauty, and\r\nit is indeed a most interesting sight. The movements do not immediately\r\ncease when the temperature is suddenly lowered, even to a considerable\r\nextent, 15° C. (59° F.) for example; they are only slackened.\r\nNevertheless, it is better to observe them at the temperatures most\r\nfavourable to fermentation, even in the oven where the vessels employed\r\nin the experiment are kept at a temperature between 25° C. and 30° C.\r\n(77° F. and 86° F.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nWe may now continue our account of the fermentation which we were\r\nstudying when we made this last digression. On June 17th that\r\nfermentation produced three times as much gas as it did on June 11th,\r\nwhen the residue of hydrogen, after absorption by potash, was 72·6 per\r\ncent.; whilst on the 17th it was only 49·2 per cent. Let us again\r\ndiscuss the microscopic aspect of the turbid liquid at this stage.\r\nAppended is the sketch we made (Fig. 72) and our notes on it:—“A most\r\nbeautiful object: vibrios all in motion, advancing or undulating. They\r\nhave grown considerably in bulk and length since the 11th; many of them\r\nare joined together into long sinuous chains, very mobile at the\r\narticulations, visibly less active and more wavering in proportion to\r\nthe number that go to form the chain, or the length of the individuals.”\r\nThis description is applicable to the majority of the vibrios which\r\noccur in cylindrical rods and are homogeneous in aspect. There are\r\nothers, of rare occurrence in chains, which have a clear corpuscle, that\r\nis to say, a portion more refractive than the other parts of the\r\nsegments, at one of their extremities. Sometimes the foremost segment\r\nhas the corpuscle at one end, sometimes at the other. The long segments\r\nof the commoner kind attain a length of from 10 to 30 and even 45\r\nthousandths of a millimetre. Their diameter is from 1-½ to 2, very\r\nrarely 3, thousandths of a millimetre.[145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\nOn June 28th, fermentation was quite finished; there was no longer any\r\ntrace of gas, nor any lactate in solution. All the infusoria were lying\r\nmotionless at the bottom of the flask. The liquid clarified by degrees,\r\nand in the course of a few days became quite bright. Here we may\r\ninquire, were these motionless infusoria, which from complete exhaustion\r\nof the lactate, the source of the carbonaceous part of their food, were\r\nnow lying inert at the bottom of the fermenting vessel—were they dead\r\nbeyond power of revival?[146] The following experiment leads us to\r\nbelieve that they were not perfectly lifeless, and that they behave in\r\nthe same manner as the yeast of beer, which, after it has decomposed all\r\nthe sugar in a fermentable liquid, is ready to revive and multiply in a\r\nfresh saccharine medium. On April 22nd, 1875, we left in the oven, at a\r\ntemperature of 25° C. (77° F.), a fermentation of lactate of lime that\r\nhad been completed. The delivery tube of the flask, A, (Fig. 73) in\r\nwhich it had taken place had never been withdrawn from under the\r\nmercury. We kept the liquid under observation daily, and saw it\r\ngradually become brighter; this went on for fifteen days. We then filled\r\na similar flask, B, with the solution of lactate, which we boiled, not\r\nonly to kill the germs of vibrios which the liquid might contain, but\r\nalso to expel the air that it held in solution. When the flask, B, had\r\ncooled, we connected the two flasks, avoiding the introduction of\r\nair[147], after having slightly shaken the flask, A, to stir up the\r\ndeposit at the bottom. There was then a pressure, due to carbonic acid\r\nat the end of the delivery tube of this latter flask, at the point _a_,\r\nso that on opening the taps _r_ and _s_, the deposit at the bottom of\r\nflask A was driven over into flask B, which in consequence was\r\nimpregnated with the deposit of a fermentation that had been completed\r\nfifteen days before. Two days after impregnation, the flask B began to\r\nshow signs of fermentation. It follows, that the deposit of vibrios of a\r\ncompleted butyric fermentation may be kept, at least for a certain time,\r\nwithout losing the power of causing fermentation. It furnishes a butyric\r\nferment, capable of revival and action in a suitable, fresh, fermentable\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has attentively studied the facts which we have placed\r\nbefore him cannot, in our opinion, entertain the least doubt on the\r\nsubject of the possible multiplication of the vibrios of a fermentation\r\nof lactate of lime out of contact with atmospheric oxygen. If fresh\r\nproofs of this important proposition were necessary, they might be found\r\nin the following observations, from which it may be inferred that\r\natmospheric oxygen is capable of suddenly checking a fermentation\r\nproduced by butyric vibrios, and rendering them absolutely motionless,\r\nso that it cannot be necessary to enable them to live. On May 7th, 1862,\r\nwe placed in the oven a flask holding 2·580 litres (4-½ pints), and\r\nfilled with the solution of lactate of lime and phosphates, which we had\r\nimpregnated on the 9th with two drops of a liquid in butyric\r\nfermentation. In the course of a few days fermentation declared itself:\r\non the 16th it was in progress, but feebly; on the 18th it was active;\r\non the 30th it was very active. On June 1st it yielded hourly 35 c.c.\r\n(2·3 cubic inches) of gas, containing ten per cent. of hydrogen. On the\r\n2nd we began the study of the action of air on the vibrios of this\r\nfermentation. To do this we cut off the delivery-tube on a level with\r\nits point of junction to the flask, then with a 50 c.c. pipette we took\r\nout that quantity (1-3/4 fl. oz.) of liquid which was, of course,\r\nreplaced at once by air. We then reversed the flask with the opening\r\nunder the mercury, and shook it every ten minutes for more than an hour.\r\nWishing to make sure, to begin with, that the oxygen had been absorbed,\r\nwe connected under the mercury the beak of the flask by means of a thin\r\nindia-rubber tube filled with water, with a small flask, the neck of\r\nwhich had been drawn out, and was filled with water; we then raised the\r\nlarge flask with the smaller kept above it. A Mohr’s clip, which closed\r\nthe india-rubber tube, and which we then opened, permitted the water\r\ncontained in the small flask to pass into the large one, whilst the gas,\r\non the contrary, passed upwards from the large flask into the small one.\r\nWe analyzed the gas immediately, and found that, allowing for carbonic\r\nacid and hydrogen, it did not contain more than 14·2 per cent. of\r\noxygen, which corresponds to an absorption of 6·6 c.c., or of 3·3 c.c.\r\n(0·2 cubic inch) of oxygen for the 50 c.c. (3·05 cubic inches) of air\r\nemployed. Lastly, we again established connection by an india-rubber\r\ntube between the flasks, after having seen by microscopical examination\r\nthat the movements of the vibrios were very languid. Fermentation had\r\nbecome less vigorous without having actually ceased, no doubt because\r\nsome portions of the liquid had not been brought into contact with the\r\natmospheric oxygen, in spite of the prolonged shaking that the flask had\r\nundergone after the introduction of the air. Whatever the cause might\r\nhave been, the significance of the phenomenon is not doubtful. To assure\r\nourselves further of the effect of air on the vibrios, we half filled\r\ntwo test tubes with the fermenting liquid taken from another\r\nfermentation which had also attained its maximum of intensity, into one\r\nof which we passed a current of air, into the other carbonic acid gas.\r\nIn the course of half an hour, all the vibrios in the aerated tube were\r\ndead, or at least motionless, and fermentation had ceased. In the other\r\ntube, after three hours’ exposure to the effects of the carbonic acid\r\ngas, the vibrios were still very active, and fermentation was going on.\r\n\r\nThere is a most simple method of observing the deadly effect of\r\natmospheric air upon vibrios. We have seen in the microscopical\r\nexamination made by means of the apparatus represented in Fig. 71, how\r\nremarkable were the movements of the vibrios when absolutely deprived of\r\nair, and how easy it was to discern them. We will repeat this\r\nobservation, and at the same time make a comparative study of the same\r\nliquid, under the microscope, in the ordinary way, that is to say, by\r\nplacing a drop of the liquid on an object-glass, and covering it with a\r\nthin glass slip, a method which must necessarily bring the drop into\r\ncontact with air, if only for a moment. It is surprising what a\r\nremarkable difference is observed immediately between the movements of\r\nthe vibrios in the bulb and of those under the glass. In the case of the\r\nlatter we generally see all movement at once cease near the edges of the\r\nglass, where the drop of liquid is in direct contact with the air; the\r\nmovements continue for a longer or shorter time about the centre, in\r\nproportion as the air is more or less intercepted by the vibrios at the\r\ncircumference of the liquid. It does not require much skill in\r\nexperiments of this kind to enable one to see plainly that immediately\r\nafter the glass has been placed on the drop, which has been affected all\r\nover by atmospheric air, the whole of the vibrios seem to languish and\r\nto manifest symptoms of illness—we can think of no better expression to\r\nexplain what we see taking place—and that they gradually recover their\r\nactivity about the centre, in proportion as they find themselves in a\r\npart of the medium that is less affected by the presence of oxygen.\r\n\r\nSome most curious facts are to be found in connection with an\r\nobservation, the correlative and inverse of the foregoing, on the\r\nordinary aërobian bacteria. If we examine below the microscope a drop of\r\nliquid full of these organisms under a coverslip, we very soon observe a\r\ncessation of motion in all the bacteria which lie in the central portion\r\nof the liquid, where the oxygen rapidly disappears to supply the\r\nnecessities of the bacteria existing there; whilst, on the other hand,\r\nnear the edges of the cover-glass the movements are very active, in\r\nconsequence of the constant supply of air. In spite of the speedy death\r\nof the bacteria beneath the centre of the glass, we see life prolonged\r\nthere if by chance a bubble of air has been enclosed. All round this\r\nbubble a vast number of bacteria collect in a thick, moving circle, but\r\nas soon as all the oxygen of the bubble has been absorbed they fall\r\napparently lifeless, and are scattered by the movement of the\r\nliquid.[148]\r\n\r\nWe may here be permitted to add, as a purely historical matter, that it\r\nwas these two observations just described, made successively one day in\r\n1861, on vibrios and bacteria, that first suggested to us the idea of\r\nthe possibility of life without air, and caused us to think that the\r\nvibrios which we met so frequently in our lactic fermentations must be\r\nthe true butyric ferment.\r\n\r\nWe may pause a moment to consider an interesting question in reference\r\nto the two characters under which vibrios appear in butyric\r\nfermentations. What is the reason that some vibrios exhibit refractive\r\ncorpuscles, generally of a lenticular form, such as we see in Fig. 72?\r\nWe are strongly inclined to believe that these corpuscles have to do\r\nwith a special mode of reproduction in the vibrios, common alike to the\r\nanaërobian forms which we are studying, and the ordinary aërobian forms\r\nin which also the corpuscles of which we are speaking may occur. The\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon, from our point of view, would be that,\r\nafter a certain number of fissiparous generations, and under the\r\ninfluence of variations in the composition of the medium, which is\r\nconstantly changing through fermentation as well as through the active\r\nlife of the vibrios themselves, cysts, which are simply the refractive\r\ncorpuscles, form along them at different points. From these gemmules we\r\nhave ultimately produced vibrios, ready to reproduce others by the\r\nprocess of transverse division for a certain time, to be themselves\r\nencysted later on. Various observations incline us to believe that, in\r\ntheir ordinary form of minute, soft, exuberant rods, the vibrios perish\r\nwhen submitted to desiccation, but when they occur in the corpuscular or\r\nencysted form they possess unusual powers of resistance, and may be\r\nbrought to the state of dry dust and be wafted about by winds. None of\r\nthe matter which surrounds the corpuscle or cyst seems to take part in\r\nthe preservation of the germ, when the cyst is formed, for it is all\r\nre-absorbed, gradually leaving the cyst bare. The cysts appear as masses\r\nof corpuscles, in which the most practised eye cannot detect anything of\r\nan organic nature, or anything to remind one of the vibrios which\r\nproduced them; nevertheless, these minute bodies are endowed with a\r\nlatent vital action, and only await favourable conditions to develop\r\nlong rods of vibrios. We are not, it is true, in a position to adduce\r\nany very forcible proofs in support of these opinions. They have been\r\nsuggested to us by experiments, none of which, however, have been\r\nabsolutely decisive in their favour. We may cite one of our observations\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nIn a fermentation of glycerine in a mineral medium—the glycerine was\r\nfermenting under the influence of butyric vibrios—after we had\r\ndetermined the, we may say, exclusive presence of lenticular vibrios,\r\nwith refractive corpuscles, we observed the fermentation, which, for\r\nsome unknown reason, had been very languid, suddenly become extremely\r\nactive, but now through the influence of ordinary vibrios. The gemmules\r\nwith brilliant corpuscles had almost disappeared; we could see but very\r\nfew, and those now consisted of the refractive bodies alone, the bulk of\r\nthe vibrios accompanying them having undergone some process of\r\nre-absorption.\r\n\r\nAnother observation which still more closely accords with this\r\nhypothesis is given in our work on the silkworm disease (vol. i., page\r\n256). We there demonstrate that, when we place in water some of the dust\r\nformed of desiccated vibrios, containing a host of these refractive\r\ncorpuscles, in the course of a very few hours large vibrios appear,\r\nwell-developed rods fully grown, in which the brilliant points are\r\nabsent; whilst in the water no process of development from smaller\r\nvibrios is to be discerned, a fact which seems to show that the former\r\nhad issued fully grown from the refractive corpuscles, just as we see\r\n_colpoda_ issue with their adult aspect from the dust of their cysts.\r\nThis observation, we may remark, furnishes one of the best proofs that\r\ncan be adduced against the spontaneous generation of vibrios or\r\nbacteria, since it is probable that the same observation applies to\r\nbacteria. It is true that we cannot say of mere points of dust, examined\r\nunder the microscope, that one particular germ belongs to vibrio,\r\nanother to bacterium; but how is it possible to doubt that the vibrios\r\nissue, as we see them, from an ovum of some kind, a cyst, or germ, of\r\ndeterminate character, when, after having placed some of these\r\nindeterminate motes of dust into clean water, we suddenly see, after an\r\ninterval of not more than one or two hours, an adult vibrio crossing the\r\nfield of the microscope, without our having been able to detect any\r\nintermediate state between its birth and adolescence?\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether differences in the aspect and nature of\r\nvibrios, which depend upon their more or less advanced age, or are\r\noccasioned by the influence of certain conditions of the medium in which\r\nthey propagate, do not bring about corresponding changes in the course\r\nof the fermentation and the nature of its products. Judging at least\r\nfrom the variations in the proportions of hydrogen and carbonic acid gas\r\nproduced in butyric fermentations, we are inclined to think that this\r\nmust be the case; nay, more, we find that hydrogen is not even a\r\nconstant product in these fermentations. We have met with butyric\r\nfermentations of lactate of lime which did not yield the minutest trace\r\nof hydrogen, or anything besides carbonic acid. Fig. 74 represents the\r\nvibrios which we observed in a fermentation of this kind. They present\r\nno special features. Butyl alcohol is, according to our observations, an\r\nordinary product, although it varies and is by no means a necessary\r\nconcomitant of these fermentations. It might be supposed, since butylic\r\nalcohol may be produced, and hydrogen be in deficit, that the proportion\r\nof the former of these products would attain its maximum when the latter\r\nassumed a minimum. This, however, is by no means the case; even in those\r\nfew fermentations that we have met with in which hydrogen was absent,\r\nthere was no formation of butylic alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of all the facts detailed in this paragraph we can\r\nhave no hesitation in concluding that, on the one hand, in cases of\r\nbutyric fermentation, the vibrios which abound in them and constitute\r\ntheir ferment, live without air or free oxygen; and that, on the other\r\nhand, the presence of gaseous oxygen operates prejudicially against the\r\nmovements and activity of those vibrios. But now does it follow that the\r\npresence of minute quantities of air brought into contact with a liquid\r\nundergoing butyric fermentation would prevent the continuance of that\r\nfermentation, or even exercise any check upon it? We have not made any\r\ndirect experiments upon this subject; but we should not be surprised to\r\nfind that, so far from hindering, air may, under such circumstances,\r\nfacilitate the propagation of the vibrios and accelerate fermentation.\r\nThis is exactly what happens in the case of yeast. But how could we\r\nreconcile this, supposing it were proved to be the case, with the fact\r\njust insisted on as to the danger of bringing the butyric vibrios into\r\ncontact with air? It may be possible that _life without air_ results\r\nfrom habit, whilst _death through air_ may be brought about by a sudden\r\nchange in the conditions of the existence of the vibrios. The following\r\nremarkable experiment is well known: A bird is placed in a glass jar of\r\none or two litres (60 to 120 cubic inches) in capacity, which is then\r\nclosed. After a time the creature exhibits every sign of intense\r\nuneasiness and asphyxia long before it dies; a similar bird of the same\r\nsize is introduced into the jar; the death of the latter takes place\r\ninstantaneously, whilst the life of the former may still be prolonged\r\nunder these conditions for a considerable time, and there is no\r\ndifficulty even in restoring the bird to perfect health by taking it out\r\nof the jar. It seems impossible to deny that we have here a case of the\r\nadaptation of an organism to the gradual contamination of the medium;\r\nand so it may likewise happen that the anaërobian vibrios of a butyric\r\nfermentation, which develop and multiply absolutely without free oxygen,\r\nperish immediately when suddenly taken out of their airless medium, and\r\nthat the result might be different if they had been gradually brought\r\nunder the action of air in small quantities at a time.\r\n\r\nWe are compelled here to admit that vibrios frequently abound in liquids\r\nexposed to the air, and that they appropriate the atmospheric oxygen,\r\nand could not withstand a sudden removal from its influence. Must we,\r\nthen, believe that such vibrios are absolutely different from those of\r\nbutyric fermentations? It would, perhaps, be more natural to admit that\r\nin the one case there is an adaptation to life with air, and in the\r\nother case an adaptation to life without air; each of these varieties\r\nperishing when suddenly transferred from its habitual condition to that\r\nof the other, whilst by a series of progressive changes one might be\r\nmodified into the other.[149] We know that in the case of alcoholic\r\nferments, although these can actually live without air, propagation is\r\nwonderfully assisted by the presence of minute quantities of air; and\r\ncertain experiments, which we have not yet published, lead us to believe\r\nthat, after having lived without air, they cannot be suddenly exposed\r\nwith impunity to the influence of large quantities of oxygen.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that aërobian torulæ and anaërobian\r\nferments present an example of organisms apparently identical, in which,\r\nhowever, we have not yet been able to discover any ties of a common\r\norigin. Hence we were forced to regard them as distinct species; and so\r\nit is possible that there may likewise be aërobian and anaërobian\r\nvibrios without any transformation of the one into the other.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised whether vibrios, especially those which we\r\nhave shown to be the ferment of butyric and many other fermentations,\r\nare, in their nature, animal or vegetable. M. Ch. Robin attaches great\r\nimportance to the solution of this question, of which he speaks as\r\nfollows[150]:—“The determination of the nature, whether animal or\r\nvegetable, of organisms, either as a whole or in respect to their\r\nanatomical parts, assimilative or reproductive, is a problem which has\r\nbeen capable of solution for a quarter of a century. The method has been\r\nbrought to a state of remarkable precision, experimentally, as well as\r\nin its theoretical aspects, since those who devote their attention to\r\nthe organic sciences consider it indispensable in every observation and\r\nexperiment to determine accurately, before anything else, whether the\r\nobject of their study is animal or vegetable in its nature, whether\r\nadult or otherwise. To neglect this is as serious an omission for such\r\nstudents, as for chemists would be the neglecting to determine whether\r\nit is nitrogen or hydrogen, urea or stearine that has been extracted\r\nfrom a tissue, or which it is whose combinations they are studying in\r\nthis or that chemical operation. Now, scarcely any one of those who\r\nstudy fermentations, properly so called, and putrefactions, ever pay\r\nattention to the preceding data.... Among the observers to whom I allude\r\neven M. Pasteur is to be found, who, even in his most recent\r\ncommunications, omits to state definitely what is the nature of many of\r\nthe ferments which he has studied, with the exception, however, of those\r\nwhich belong to the cryptogamic group called _torulaceæ_. Various\r\npassages in his works seem to show that he considers the cryptogamic\r\norganisms called _bacteria_, as well as those known as _vibrios_, as\r\nbelonging to the animal kingdom (see _Bulletin de l’Académie de\r\nMédecine_, Paris, 1875, pp. 249, 251, especially 256, 266, 267, 289, and\r\n290). These would be very different, at least physiologically, the\r\nformer being _aërobian_, whilst the vibrios are _anaërobian_, that is to\r\nsay, requiring no air to enable them to live, and being killed by\r\noxygen, should it be dissolved in the liquid to any considerable\r\nextent.”\r\n\r\nWe are unable to see the matter in the same light as our learned\r\ncolleague does; to our thinking, we should be labouring under a great\r\ndelusion were we to suppose “that it is quite as serious an omission not\r\nto determine the animal or vegetable nature of a ferment as it would be\r\nto confound nitrogen with hydrogen, or urea with stearine.” The\r\nimportance of the solutions of disputed questions often depends upon the\r\npoint of view from which these are regarded. As far as the result of our\r\nlabours is concerned, we devoted our attention to these two questions\r\nexclusively:—1. Is the ferment, in every fermentation properly so\r\ncalled, an organized being? 2. Can this organized being live without\r\nair? Now, what bearing can the question of the animal or vegetable\r\nnature of the ferment, of the organized being, have upon the\r\ninvestigation of these two problems? In studying butyric fermentation,\r\nfor example, we endeavoured to establish these two fundamental\r\npoints:—1. _The butyric ferment is a vibrio._ 2. _This vibrio may\r\ndispense with air in its life, and, as a matter of fact, does dispense\r\nwith it in the act of producing butyric fermentation._ We did not\r\nconsider it at all necessary to pronounce any opinion as to the animal\r\nor vegetable nature of this organism, and, even up to the present\r\nmoment, the idea that vibrio is an animal and not a plant is, in our\r\nminds, a matter of sentiment rather than of conviction.\r\n\r\nM. Robin, however, would have no difficulty in determining the limits of\r\nthe two kingdoms. According to him, “every variety of cellulose is, we\r\nmay say, insoluble in ammonia, as also are the reproductive elements of\r\nplants, whether male or female. Whatever phase of evolution the elements\r\nwhich reproduce a new individual may have reached, treatment with this\r\nreagent, either cold or raised to boiling, leaves them absolutely intact\r\nunder the eyes of the observer, except that their contents, from being\r\npartially dissolved, become more transparent. Every vegetable, whether\r\nmicroscopic or not, every mycelium, and every spore thus preserves in\r\nits entirety its special characteristics of form, volume, and structural\r\narrangements; whilst in the case of microscopic animals, or the ova and\r\nmicroscopic embryos of different members of the animal kingdom, the very\r\nopposite is the case.”\r\n\r\nWe should be glad to learn that the employment of a drop of ammonia\r\nwould enable us to pronounce an opinion, with this degree of confidence,\r\non the nature of the lowest microscopic beings; but is M. Robin\r\nabsolutely correct in his assumptions? That gentleman himself remarks\r\nthat spermatozoa, which belong to animal organisms, are insoluble in\r\nammonia, the effect of which is merely to make them paler. If a\r\ndifference of action in certain reagents, in ammonia, for example, were\r\nsufficient to determine the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\r\nmight we not argue that there must be a very great and natural\r\ndifference between moulds and bacteria, inasmuch as the presence of a\r\nsmall quantity of acid in the nutritive medium facilitates the growth\r\nand propagation of the former, whilst it is able to prevent the life of\r\nbacteria and vibrios? Although, as is well known, movement is not an\r\nexclusive characteristic of animals, yet we have always been inclined to\r\nregard vibrios as animals, on account of the peculiar character of their\r\nmovements. How greatly they differ in this respect from the diatomacæ,\r\nfor example! When the vibrio encounters an obstacle it turns, or after\r\nhaving assured itself by some visual effort or other that it cannot\r\novercome it, it retraces its steps. The colpoda—undoubted\r\ninfusoria—behave in an exactly similar manner. It is true one may argue\r\nthat the zoospores of certain cryptogamia exhibit similar movements; but\r\ndo not these zoospores possess as much of an animal nature as do the\r\nspermatozoa? As far as bacteria are concerned, when, as already\r\nremarked, we see them crowd round a bubble of air in a liquid to prolong\r\ntheir life, oxygen having failed them everywhere else, how can we avoid\r\nbelieving that they are animated by an instinct for life, of the same\r\nkind as that which we find in animals. M. Robin seems to us to be wrong\r\nin supposing that it is possible to draw any absolute line of separation\r\nbetween the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The settlement of this line,\r\nhowever, we repeat again, no matter what it may be, has no serious\r\nbearing upon the questions that have been the subject of our researches.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the difficulty which M. Robin has raised in objecting to\r\nthe employment of the word _germ_, when we cannot specify whether the\r\nnature of that germ is animal or vegetable, is in many respects an\r\nunnecessary one. In all the questions which we have discussed, whether\r\nwe were speaking of fermentation or spontaneous generation, the word\r\n_germ_ has been used in the sense of _origin of living organism_. If\r\nLiebig, for example, said of an albuminous substance that it gave birth\r\nto ferment, could we contradict him more plainly than by replying: “No;\r\nferment is an organized being, the germ of which is always present, and\r\nthe albuminous substance merely serves by its occurrence to nourish the\r\ngerm and its successive generations.”\r\n\r\nIn our Memoir of 1862, on so-called _spontaneous_ generations, would it\r\nnot have been an entire mistake to have attempted to assign specific\r\nnames to the microscopic organisms which we met with in the course of\r\nour observations? Not only would we have met with extreme difficulty in\r\nthe attempt, arising from the state of extreme confusion which even in\r\nthe present day exists in the classification and nomenclature of these\r\nmicroscopic organisms, but we should have been forced to sacrifice\r\nclearness in our work besides; at all events, we should have wandered\r\nfrom our principal object, which was the determination of the presence\r\nor absence of life in general, and had nothing to do with the\r\nmanifestation of a particular kind of life in this or that species,\r\nanimal or vegetable. Thus we have systematically employed the vaguest\r\nnomenclature, such as _mucors_, _torulæ_, _bacteria_, and _vibrios_.\r\nThere was nothing arbitrary in our doing this, whereas there is much\r\nthat is arbitrary in adopting a definite system of nomenclature, and\r\napplying it to organisms but imperfectly known, the differences or\r\nresemblances between which are only recognizable through certain\r\ncharacteristics, the true signification of which is obscure. Take, for\r\nexample, the extensive array of widely different systems that have been\r\ninvented during the last few years for the species of the genera\r\nbacterium and vibrio in the works of Cohn, H. Hoffmann, Hallier, and\r\nBillroth. The confusion which prevails here is very great, although we\r\ndo not of course by any means place these different works on the same\r\nfooting as regards their respective merits.\r\n\r\nM. Robin is, however, right in recognizing the impossibility of\r\nmaintaining in the present day, as he formerly did, “that fermentation\r\nis an exterior phenomenon, going on outside cryptogamic cells, a\r\nphenomenon of contact. It is probably,” he adds, “an interior and\r\nmolecular action at work in the inmost recesses of the substance of each\r\ncell.” From the day when we first proved that it is possible for all\r\norganized ferments, properly so called, to spring up and multiply from\r\ntheir respective germs, sown, whether consciously or by accident, in a\r\nmineral medium free from organic and nitrogenous matters other than\r\nammonia, in which medium the fermentable matter alone is adapted to\r\nprovide the ferment with whatever carbon enters into its composition,\r\nfrom that time forward the theories of Liebig, as well as that of\r\nBerzelius, which M. Robin formerly defended, have had to give place to\r\nothers more in harmony with facts. We trust that the day will come when\r\nM. Robin will likewise acknowledge that he has been in error on the\r\nsubject of the doctrine of spontaneous generation, which he continues to\r\naffirm, without adducing any direct proofs in support of it, at the end\r\nof the article to which we have been here replying.\r\n\r\nWe have devoted the greater part of this chapter to the establishing\r\nwith all possible exactness the extremely important physiological fact\r\nof life without air, and its correlation to the phenomena of\r\nfermentations properly so called—that is to say, of those which are due\r\nto the presence of microscopic cellular organisms. This is the chief\r\nbasis of the new theory that we propose for the explanation of these\r\nphenomena. The details into which we have entered were indispensable on\r\naccount of the novelty of the subject no less than on account of the\r\nnecessity we were under of combating the criticisms of the two German\r\nnaturalists, Drs. Oscar Brefeld and Traube, whose works had cast some\r\ndoubts on the correctness of the facts upon which we had based the\r\npreceding propositions. We have much pleasure in adding that at the very\r\nmoment when we were revising the proofs of this chapter, we received\r\nfrom M. Brefeld an essay, dated from Berlin, January, 1876, in which,\r\nafter describing his later experimental researches, he owns with\r\npraiseworthy frankness that Dr. Traube and he were both of them\r\nmistaken. Life without air is now a proposition which he accepts as\r\nperfectly demonstrated. He has witnessed it in the case of _mucor\r\nracemosus_, and has also verified it in the case of yeast. “If,” he\r\nsays, “after the results of my previous researches, which I conducted\r\nwith all possible exactness, I was inclined to consider Pasteur’s\r\nassertions as inaccurate, and to attack them, I have no hesitation now\r\nin recognizing them as true, and in proclaiming the service which\r\nPasteur has rendered to science in being the first to indicate the exact\r\nrelation of things in the phenomenon of fermentation.” In his later\r\nresearches. Dr. Brefeld has adopted the method which we have long\r\nemployed for demonstrating the life and multiplication of butyric\r\nvibrios in the entire absence of air, as well as the method of\r\nconducting growths in mineral media associated with the fermentable\r\nsubstance. We need not pause to consider certain other secondary\r\ncriticisms of Dr. Brefeld. A perusal of the present work will, we trust,\r\nconvince him that they are based on no surer foundation than were his\r\nformer criticisms.\r\n\r\nTo bring one’s self to believe in a truth that has just dawned upon one\r\nis the first step towards progress; to persuade others is the second.\r\nThere is a third step, less useful perhaps, but highly gratifying\r\nnevertheless, which is, to convince one’s opponents.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, have experienced great satisfaction in learning that we\r\nhave won over to our ideas an observer of singular ability, on a subject\r\nwhich is of the utmost importance to the physiology of cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n    § VI.—Reply to the Critical Observations of Liebig, Published in\r\n                               1870.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Memoir which we published, in 1860, on alcoholic fermentation,\r\nand in several subsequent works, we were led to a different conclusion\r\non the causes of this very remarkable phenomenon from that which Liebig\r\nhad adopted. The opinions of Mitscherlich and Berzelius had ceased to be\r\ntenable in the presence of the new facts which we had brought to light.\r\nFrom that time we felt sure that the celebrated chemist of Munich had\r\nadopted our conclusions, from the fact that he remained silent on this\r\nquestion for a long time, although it had been until then the constant\r\nsubject of his study, as is shown by all his works. Suddenly there\r\nappeared in the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_ a long essay,\r\nreproduced from a lecture delivered by him before the Academy of Bavaria\r\nin 1868 and 1869. In this Liebig again maintained, not, however, without\r\ncertain modifications, the views which he had expressed in his former\r\npublications, and disputed the correctness of the principal facts\r\nenunciated in our Memoir of 1860, on which were based the arguments\r\nagainst his theory.\r\n\r\n“I had admitted,” he says, “that the resolution of fermentable matter\r\ninto compounds of a simpler kind must be traced to some process of\r\ndecomposition taking place in the ferment, and that the action of this\r\nsame ferment on the fermentable matter must continue or cease according\r\nto the prolongation or cessation of the alteration produced in the\r\nferment. The molecular change in the sugar would, consequently, be\r\nbrought about by the destruction or modification of one or more of the\r\ncomponent parts of the ferment, and could only take place through the\r\ncontact of the two substances. M. Pasteur regards fermentation in the\r\nfollowing light:—The chemical action of fermentation is essentially a\r\nphenomenon correlative with a vital action, beginning and ending with\r\nit. He believes that alcoholic fermentation can never occur without the\r\nsimultaneous occurrence of organization, development, and multiplication\r\nof globules, or continuous life, carried on from globules already\r\nformed. But the idea that the decomposition of sugar during fermentation\r\nis due to the development of the cellules of the ferment, is in\r\ncontradiction with the fact that the ferment is able to bring about the\r\nfermentation of a pure solution of sugar. The greater part of the\r\nferment is composed of a substance that is rich in nitrogen and contains\r\nsulphur. It contains, moreover, an appreciable quantity of phosphates,\r\nhence it is difficult to conceive how, in the absence of these elements\r\nin a pure solution of sugar undergoing fermentation, the number of cells\r\nis capable of any increase.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Liebig’s belief to the contrary, the idea that the\r\ndecomposition of sugar during fermentation is intimately connected with\r\na development of the cellules of the ferment, or a prolongation of the\r\nlife of cellules already formed, is in no way opposed to the fact that\r\nthe ferment is capable of bringing about the fermentation of a pure\r\nsolution of sugar. It is manifest to any one who has studied such\r\nfermentation with the microscope, even in those cases where the\r\nsweetened water has been absolutely pure, that ferment-cells do\r\nmultiply, the reason being that the cells carry with them all the\r\nfood-supplies necessary for the life of the ferment. They may be\r\nobserved budding, at least many of them, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthose which do not bud still continue to live; life has other ways of\r\nmanifesting itself besides development and cell-proliferation.\r\n\r\nIf we refer to the figures on page 81 of our Memoir of 1860, Experiments\r\nD, E, F, G, H, I, we shall see that the weight of yeast, in the case of\r\nthe fermentation of a pure solution of sugar, undergoes a considerable\r\nincrease, even without taking into account the fact that the sugared\r\nwater gains from the yeast certain soluble parts, since, in the\r\nexperiments just mentioned, the weights of solid yeast, washed and dried\r\nat 100° C. (212° F.), are much greater than those of the raw yeast\r\nemployed, dried at the same temperature.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments we employed the following weights of yeast,\r\nexpressed in grammes (1 gramme = 15·43 grains)—\r\n\r\n                                 2·313\r\n                                 2·626\r\n                                 1·198\r\n                                 0·699\r\n                                 0·326\r\n                                 0·476\r\n\r\nwhich became after fermentation, we repeat, without taking into account\r\nthe matters which the sugared water gained from the yeast—\r\n\r\n                                     grammes. grains.\r\n\r\n                   2·486   [Increase 0·173 =  2·65\r\n                   2·963   “         0·337 =  5·16\r\n                   1·700   ”         0·502 =  7·7\r\n                   0·712   “         0·013 =  0·2\r\n                   0·335   ”         0·009 =  0·14\r\n                   0·590   “         0·114 =  1·75\r\n\r\nHave we not in this marked increase in weight a proof of life, or, to\r\nadopt an expression which may be preferred, a proof of a profound\r\nchemical work of nutrition and assimilation?\r\n\r\nWe may cite on this subject one of our earlier experiments, which is to\r\nbe found in the _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_ for the year 1857, and\r\nwhich clearly shows the great influence exerted on fermentation by the\r\nsoluble portion that the sugared water takes up from the globules of\r\nferment:—\r\n\r\n“We take two equal quantities of fresh yeast that have been washed very\r\nfreely. One of these we cause to ferment in water containing nothing but\r\nsugar, and, after removing from the other all its soluble particles—by\r\nboiling it in an excess of water and then filtering it to separate the\r\nglobules—we add to the filtered liquid as much sugar as was used in the\r\nfirst case along with a mere trace of fresh yeast, insufficient, as far\r\nas its weight is concerned, to affect the results of our experiment. The\r\nglobules which we have sown bud, the liquid becomes turbid, a deposit of\r\nyeast gradually forms, and, side by side with these appearances, the\r\ndecomposition of the sugar is effected, and in the course of a few hours\r\nmanifests itself clearly. These results are such as we might have\r\nanticipated. The following fact, however, is of importance. In effecting\r\nby these means the organization into globules of the soluble part of the\r\nyeast that we used in the second case, we find that a considerable\r\nquantity of sugar is decomposed. The following are the results of our\r\nexperiment: 5 grammes of yeast caused the fermentation of 12·9 grammes\r\nof sugar in six days, at the end of which time it was exhausted. The\r\nsoluble portion of a like quantity of 5 grammes of the same yeast caused\r\nthe fermentation of 10 grammes of sugar in nine days, after which the\r\nyeast developed by the sowing was likewise exhausted.”\r\n\r\nHow is it possible to maintain that, in the fermentation of water\r\ncontaining nothing but sugar, the soluble portion of the yeast does not\r\nact, either in the production of new globules or the perfection of old\r\nones, when we see, in the preceding experiment, that after this\r\nnitrogenous and mineral portion has been removed by boiling, it\r\nimmediately serves for the production of new globules, which, under the\r\ninfluence of the sowing of a mere trace of globules, causes the\r\nfermentation of much sugar?[152]\r\n\r\nIn short, Liebig is not justified in saying that the solution of pure\r\nsugar, caused to ferment by means of yeast, contains none of the\r\nelements needed for the growth of yeast, neither nitrogen, sulphur, nor\r\nphosphorus, and that, consequently, it should not be possible, by our\r\ntheory, for the sugar to ferment. On the contrary, the solution does\r\ncontain all these elements, as a consequence of the introduction and\r\npresence of the yeast.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed with our examination of Liebig’s criticisms:—\r\n\r\n“To this,” he goes on to say, “must be added the decomposing action\r\nwhich yeast exercises on a great number of substances, and which\r\nresembles that which sugar undergoes. I have shown that malate of lime\r\nferments readily enough through the action of yeast, and that it splits\r\nup into three other calcareous salts, namely the acetate, the carbonate,\r\nand the succinate. If the action of yeast consists in its increase and\r\nmultiplication, it is difficult to conceive this action in the case of\r\nmalate of lime and other calcareous salts of vegetable acids.”\r\n\r\nThis statement, with all due deference to the opinion of our illustrious\r\ncritic, is by no means correct. Yeast has no action on malate of lime,\r\nor on other calcareous salts formed by vegetable acids. Liebig had\r\npreviously, much to his own satisfaction, brought forward urea as being\r\ncapable of transformation into carbonate of ammonia during alcoholic\r\nfermentation in contact with yeast. This has been proved by us to be\r\nerroneous. It is an error of the same kind that Liebig again brings\r\nforward here. In the fermentation of which he speaks (that of malate of\r\nlime), certain spontaneous ferments are produced, the germs of which are\r\nassociated with the yeast, and develop in the mixture of yeast and\r\nmalate. The yeast merely serves as a source of food for these new\r\nferments without taking any direct part in the fermentations of which we\r\nare speaking. Our researches leave no doubt on this point, as is evident\r\nfrom the observations on the fermentations of tartrate of lime\r\npreviously given.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are circumstances under which yeast brings about\r\nmodifications in different substances. Doebereiner and Mitscherlich,\r\nmore especially, have shown that yeast imparts to water a soluble\r\nmaterial, which liquefies cane-sugar and produces inversion in it by\r\ncausing it to take up the elements of water, just as diastase behaves to\r\nstarch or emulsin to amygdalin.\r\n\r\nM. Berthelot also has shown that this substance may be isolated by\r\nprecipitating it with alcohol, in the same way as diastase is\r\nprecipitated from its solutions.[153] These are remarkable facts, which\r\nare, however, at present but vaguely connected with the alcoholic\r\nfermentation of sugar by means of yeast. The researches in which we have\r\nproved the existence of special forms of living ferments in many\r\nfermentations, which one might have supposed to have been produced by\r\nsimple contact action, had established beyond doubt the existence of\r\nprofound differences between those fermentations, which we have\r\ndistinguished as fermentations proper, and the phenomena connected with\r\nsoluble substances. The more we advance, the more clearly we are able to\r\ndetect these differences. M. Dumas has insisted on the fact that the\r\nferments of fermentation proper multiply and reproduce themselves in the\r\nprocess, whilst the others are destroyed.[154] Still more recently M.\r\nMüntz has shown that chloroform prevents fermentations proper, but does\r\nnot interfere with the action of diastase (_Comptes rendus_, 1875.) M.\r\nBouchardat had already established the fact that “hydrocyanic acid,\r\nsalts of mercury, ether, alcohol, creosote, and the oils of turpentine,\r\nlemon, cloves, and mustard destroy or check alcoholic fermentation,\r\nwhilst in no way interfering with the glucoside fermentations” (_Annales\r\nde Chimie et de Physique_, 3rd series, t. xiv., 1845.) We may add, in\r\npraise of M. Bouchardat’s sagacity, that that skilful observer has\r\nalways considered these results as a proof that alcoholic fermentation\r\nis dependent on the life of the yeast-cell, and that a distinction\r\nshould be made between the two orders of fermentation.\r\n\r\nM. Paul Bert, in his remarkable studies on the influence of barometric\r\npressure on the phenomena of life, has recognized the fact that\r\ncompressed oxygen is fatal to certain ferments, whilst under similar\r\nconditions it does not interfere with the action of those substances\r\nclassed under the name of _soluble ferments_, such as diastase (the\r\nferment which inverts cane sugar), emulsin, and others. During their\r\nstay in compressed air, ferments proper ceased their activity, nor did\r\nthey resume it, even after exposure to air at ordinary pressures,\r\nprovided the access of germs was prevented.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Liebig’s principal objection, with which he concludes his\r\ningenious argument, and to which no less than eight or nine pages of the\r\n_Annales_ are devoted.\r\n\r\nOur author takes up the question of the possibility of causing yeast to\r\ngrow in sweetened water, to which a salt of ammonia and some yeast-ash\r\nhave been added—a fact which is evidently incompatible with his theory\r\nthat a ferment is always an albuminous substance on its way to\r\ndecomposition. In this case the albuminous substance does not exist; we\r\nhave only the mineral substances which will serve to produce it. We know\r\nthat Liebig regarded yeast, and, generally speaking, any ferment\r\nwhatever, as being a nitrogenous, albuminous substance which, in the\r\nsame way as emulsin, for example, possesses the power of bringing about\r\ncertain chemical decompositions. He connected fermentation with the easy\r\ndecomposition of that albuminous substance, and imagined that the\r\nphenomenon occurred in the following manner:—“The albuminous substance\r\non its way to decomposition possesses the power of communicating to\r\ncertain other bodies that same state of mobility by which its own atoms\r\nare already affected; and through its contact with other bodies it\r\nimparts to them the power of decomposing or of entering into other\r\ncombinations.” Here Liebig failed to perceive that the ferment, in its\r\ncapacity of a living organism, had anything to do with the fermentation.\r\n\r\nThis theory dates back as far as 1843. In 1846 Messrs. Boutron and\r\nFremy, in a Memoir on lactic fermentation, published in the _Annales de\r\nChimie et de Physique_, strained the conclusions deducible from it to a\r\nmost unjustifiable extent. They asserted that one and the same\r\nnitrogenous substance might undergo various modifications in contact\r\nwith air, so as to become successively alcoholic, lactic, butyric, and\r\nother ferments. There is nothing more convenient than purely\r\nhypothetical theories, theories which are not the necessary consequences\r\nof facts; when fresh facts which cannot be reconciled with the original\r\nhypothesis are discovered, new hypotheses can be tacked on to the old\r\nones. This is exactly what Liebig and Fremy have done, each in his turn,\r\nunder the pressure of our studies, commenced in 1857. In 1864 Fremy\r\ndevised the theory of _hemi-organism_, which meant nothing more than\r\nthat he gave up Liebig’s theory of 1843, together with the additions\r\nwhich Boutron and he had made to it in 1846; in other words, he\r\nabandoned the idea of albuminous substances being ferments, to take up\r\nanother idea, that albuminous substances, in contact with air, are\r\npeculiarly adapted to undergo organization into new beings—that is, the\r\nliving ferments which we had discovered—and that the ferments of beer\r\nand of the grape have a common origin.\r\n\r\nThis theory of hemi-organism was word for word the antiquated opinion of\r\nTurpin, as may be readily seen by referring to Chapter IV., section III.\r\nof the present work. The public, especially a certain section of the\r\npublic, did not go very deeply into an examination of the subject. It\r\nwas the period when the doctrine of spontaneous generation was being\r\ndiscussed with much warmth. The new word hemi-organism, which was the\r\nonly novelty in M. Fremy’s theory, deceived people. It was thought that\r\nM. Fremy had really discovered the solution of the question of the day.\r\nIt is true that it was rather difficult to understand the process by\r\nwhich an albuminous substance could become all at once a living and\r\nbudding cell. This difficulty was readily solved by M. Fremy, who\r\ndeclared that it was the result of some power that was not yet\r\nunderstood, the power of “organic impulse.”[155]\r\n\r\nLiebig, who, as well as M. Fremy, was compelled to renounce his original\r\nopinions concerning the nature of ferments, devised the following\r\nobscure theory (Memoir by Liebig, 1870, already cited):—\r\n\r\n“There seems to be no doubt as to the part which the vegetable organism\r\nplays in the phenomenon of fermentation. It is through it alone that an\r\nalbuminous substance and sugar are enabled to unite and form this\r\nparticular combination, this unstable form under which alone, as a\r\ncomponent part of the mycoderm, they manifest an action on sugar. Should\r\nthe mycoderm cease to grow, the bond which unites the constituent parts\r\nof the cellular contents is loosened, and it is through the motion\r\nproduced therein that the cells of yeast bring about a disarrangement or\r\nseparation of the elements of the sugar into other organic molecules.”\r\n\r\nOne might easily believe that the translator for the _Annales_ has made\r\nsome mistake, so great is the obscurity of this passage.\r\n\r\nWhether we take this new form of the theory or the old one, neither can\r\nbe reconciled at all with the development of yeast and fermentation in a\r\nsaccharine mineral medium, for in the latter experiment fermentation is\r\ncorrelative to the life of the ferment and to its nutrition, a constant\r\nchange going on between the ferment and its food-matters, since all the\r\ncarbon assimilated by the ferment is derived from sugar, its nitrogen\r\nfrom ammonia, and phosphorus from the phosphates in solution. And even\r\nall said, what purpose can be served by the gratuitous hypothesis of\r\ncontact-action or communicated motion? The experiment of which we are\r\nspeaking is thus a fundamental one; indeed, it is its possibility that\r\nconstitutes the most effective point in the controversy. No doubt Liebig\r\nmight say, “but it is the motion of life and of nutrition which\r\nconstitutes your experiment, and this is the communicated motion that my\r\ntheory requires.” Curiously enough, Liebig does endeavour, as a matter\r\nof fact, to say this, but he does so timidly and incidentally: “From a\r\nchemical point of view, which point of view I would not willingly\r\nabandon, a _vital action_ is a phenomenon of motion, and, in this double\r\nsense of _life_ M. Pasteur’s theory agrees with my own, and is not in\r\ncontradiction with it (page 6).” This is true. Elsewhere Liebig says:—\r\n\r\n“It is possible that the only correlation between the physiological act\r\nand the phenomenon of fermentation is the production, in the living\r\ncell, of the substance which, by some special property analogous to that\r\nby which emulsin exerts a decomposing action on salicin and amygdalin,\r\nmay bring about the decomposition of sugar into other organic molecules;\r\nthe physiological act, in this view, would be necessary for the\r\nproduction of this substance, but would have nothing else to do with the\r\nfermentation (page 10).” To this, again, we have no objection to raise.\r\n\r\nLiebig, however, does not dwell upon these considerations, which he\r\nmerely notices in passing, because he is well aware that, as far as the\r\ndefence of his theory is concerned, they would be mere evasions. If he\r\nhad insisted on them, or based his opposition solely upon them, our\r\nanswer would have been simply this: “If you admit with us that\r\nfermentation is correlated with the life and nutrition of the ferment,\r\nwe agree upon the principal point. So agreeing, let us examine, if you\r\nwill, the actual cause of fermentation;—this is a second question, quite\r\ndistinct from the first. Science is built up of successive solutions\r\ngiven to questions of ever-increasing subtlety, approaching nearer and\r\nnearer towards the very essence of phenomena. If we proceed to discuss\r\ntogether the question of how living, organized beings act in decomposing\r\nfermentable substances, we will be found to fall out once more on your\r\nhypothesis of communicated motion, since, according to our ideas, the\r\nactual cause of fermentation is to be sought, in most cases, in the fact\r\nof life without air, which is the characteristic of many ferments.”\r\n\r\nLet us briefly see what Liebig thinks of the experiment in which\r\nfermentation is produced by the impregnation of a saccharine mineral\r\nmedium, a result so greatly at variance with his mode of viewing the\r\nquestion.[156] After deep consideration he pronounces this experiment to\r\nbe inexact, and the result ill-founded. Liebig, however, was not one to\r\nreject a fact without grave reasons for his doing so, or with the sole\r\nobject of evading a troublesome discussion. “I have repeated this\r\nexperiment,” he says, “a great number of times, with the greatest\r\npossible care, and have obtained the same results as M. Pasteur,\r\nexcepting as regards the formation and increase of the ferment.” It was,\r\nhowever, the formation and increase of the ferment that constituted the\r\npoint of the experiment. Our discussion was, therefore, distinctly\r\nlimited to this: Liebig denied that the ferment was capable of\r\ndevelopment in a saccharine mineral medium, whilst we asserted that this\r\ndevelopment did actually take place, and was comparatively easy to\r\nprove. In 1871 we replied to M. Liebig before the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences in a Note, in which we offered to prepare in a mineral medium,\r\nin the presence of a commission to be chosen for the purpose, as great a\r\nweight of ferment as Liebig could reasonably demand.[157] We were bolder\r\nthan we should, perhaps, have been in 1860; the reason was that our\r\nknowledge of the subject had been strengthened by ten years of renewed\r\nresearch. Liebig did not accept our proposal, nor did he even reply to\r\nour Note. Up to the time of his death, which took place on April 18th,\r\n1873, he wrote nothing more on the subject.[158]\r\n\r\nWhen we published, in 1860, the details of the experiment in question,\r\nwe pointed out at some length the difficulties of conducting it\r\nsuccessfully, and the possible causes of failure. We called attention\r\nparticularly to the fact that saccharine mineral media are much more\r\nsuited for the nutrition of bacteria, lactic ferment, and other lowly\r\nforms, than they are to that of yeast, and in consequence readily become\r\nfilled with various organisms from the spontaneous growth of germs\r\nderived from the particles of dust floating in the atmosphere. The\r\nreason why we do not observe the growth of alcoholic ferments,\r\nespecially at the commencement of the experiments, is because of the\r\nunsuitableness of those media for the life of yeast. The latter may,\r\nnevertheless, form in them subsequent to this development of other\r\norganized forms, by reason of the modification produced in the original\r\nmineral medium by the albuminous matters that they introduce into it. It\r\nis interesting to peruse, in our Memoir of 1860, certain facts of the\r\nsame kind relating to fermentation by means of albumens—that of the\r\nblood, for example, from which, we may mention incidentally, we were led\r\nto infer the existence of several distinct albumens in the serum, a\r\nconclusion which, since then, has been confirmed by various observers,\r\nnotably by M. Béchamp. Now, in his experiments on fermentation in\r\nsweetened water, with yeast-ash and a salt of ammonia, there is no doubt\r\nthat Liebig had failed to avoid those difficulties which are entailed by\r\nthe spontaneous growth of other organisms than yeast. Moreover, it is\r\npossible that, to have established the certainty of this result, Liebig\r\nshould have had recourse to a closer microscopical observation than from\r\ncertain passages in his Memoir he seems to have adopted. We have little\r\ndoubt that his pupils could tell us that Liebig did not even employ that\r\ninstrument without which any exact study of fermentation is not merely\r\ndifficult but well-nigh impossible. We ourselves, for the reasons\r\nmentioned, did not obtain a simple alcoholic fermentation any more than\r\nLiebig did. In that particular experiment, the details of which we gave\r\nin our Memoir of 1860, we obtained lactic and alcoholic fermentation\r\ntogether; an appreciable quantity of lactic acid formed and arrested the\r\npropagation of the lactic and alcoholic ferments, so that more than half\r\nof the sugar remained in the liquid without fermenting. This, however,\r\nin no way detracted from the correctness of the conclusion which we\r\ndeduced from the experiment, and from other similar ones; it might even\r\nbe said that, from a general and philosophical point of view—which is\r\nthe only one of interest here—the result was doubly satisfactory,\r\ninasmuch as we demonstrated that mineral media were adapted to the\r\nsimultaneous development of several organized ferments, instead of only\r\none. The fortuitous association of different ferments could not\r\ninvalidate the conclusion that all the nitrogen of the cells of the\r\nalcoholic and lactic ferments was derived from the nitrogen in the\r\nammoniacal salts, and that all the carbon of those ferments was taken\r\nfrom the sugar, since, in the medium employed in our experiment, the\r\nsugar was the only substance that contained carbon. Liebig carefully\r\nabstained from noticing this fact, which would have been fatal to the\r\nvery groundwork of his criticisms, and thought that he was keeping up\r\nthe appearance of a grave contradiction by arguing that we had never\r\nobtained a simple alcoholic fermentation. It would be unprofitable to\r\ndwell longer upon the subject of the difficulties which the propagation\r\nof yeast in a saccharine mineral medium formerly presented. As a matter\r\nof fact, the progress of our studies has imparted to the question an\r\naspect very different from that which it formerly wore; it was this\r\ncircumstance which emboldened us to offer, in our reply to Liebig before\r\nthe Academy of Sciences in 1871, to prepare, in a saccharine mineral\r\nmedium, in the presence of a commission to be appointed by our opponent,\r\nany quantity of ferment that he might require, and to effect the\r\nfermentation of any weight of sugar whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the facts detailed in the preceding chapters concerning\r\npure ferments and their manipulation in the presence of pure air,\r\nenables us to completely disregard those causes of embarrassment that\r\nresult from the fortuitous occurrence of the germs of organisms,\r\ndifferent in character from the ferments, introduced by the air or from\r\nthe sides of vessels, or even by the ferment itself.\r\n\r\nLet us once more take one of our double-necked flasks (Fig. 22, p. 110),\r\nwhich we will suppose is capable of containing three or four litres (six\r\nto eight pints).\r\n\r\nLet us put into it the following:—\r\n\r\n                   Pure distilled\r\n                   water.\r\n\r\n                   Sugar candy          200 grammes.\r\n\r\n                   Bitartrate of        1·0  “\r\n                   potassium\r\n\r\n                   ”      “  ammonia    0·5  ”\r\n\r\n                   Sulphate of ammonia  1·5  “\r\n\r\n                   Ash of yeast         1·5  ”\r\n\r\n                   [1 gramme = 15·43\r\n                   grains.]\r\n\r\nLet us boil the mixture, to destroy all germs of organisms that may\r\nexist in the air or liquid or on the sides of the flask, and then permit\r\nit to cool, after having placed, by way of extra precaution, a small\r\nquantity of asbestos in the end of the fine, curved tube. Let us next\r\nintroduce a trace of ferment into the liquid, through the other neck,\r\nwhich, as we described, is terminated by a small piece of india-rubber\r\ntube closed with a glass stopper.\r\n\r\nHere are the details of such an experiment:—\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1873, we sowed some pure ferment—_saccharomyces\r\npastorianus_. From December 11, that is, within so short a time as\r\nforty-eight hours after impregnation, we saw a multitude of extremely\r\nminute bubbles rising almost continuously from the bottom, indicating\r\nthat at this point the fermentation had commenced. On the following\r\ndays, several patches of froth appeared on the surface of the liquid. We\r\nleft the flask undisturbed in the oven, at a temperature of 25° C. (77°\r\nF.). On April 24, 1874, we tested some of the liquid, obtained by means\r\nof the straight tube, to see if it still contained any sugar. We found\r\nthat it contained less than two grammes, so that 198 grammes (4·2 oz.\r\nTroy) had already disappeared. Some time afterwards the fermentation\r\ncame to an end; we carried on the experiment, nevertheless, until April\r\n18, 1875.\r\n\r\nThere was no development of any organism absolutely foreign to the\r\nferment, which was itself abundant, a circumstance that, added to the\r\npersistent vitality of the ferment, in spite of the unsuitableness of\r\nthe medium for its nutrition, permitted the perfect completion of\r\nfermentation. There was not the minutest quantity of sugar remaining.\r\nThe total weight of ferment, after washing and drying at 100° C. (212°\r\nF.), was 2·563 grammes (39·5 grains).\r\n\r\nIn experiments of this kind, in which the ferment has to be weighed, it\r\nis better not to use any yeast-ash that cannot be dissolved completely,\r\nso as to be capable of easy separation from the ferment formed. Raulin’s\r\nliquid, the composition of which we have already given (p. 89,\r\nfootnote), may be used in such cases with success.\r\n\r\nAll the alcoholic ferments are not capable to the same extent of\r\ndevelopment by means of phosphates, ammoniacal salts, and sugar. There\r\nare some whose development is arrested a longer or shorter time before\r\nthe transformation of all the sugar. In a series of comparative\r\nexperiments, 200 grammes of sugar-candy being used in each case, we\r\nfound that whilst _saccharomyces pastorianus_ effected a complete\r\nfermentation of the sugar, the caseous ferment did not decompose more\r\nthan two-thirds, and the ferment which we have designated _new “high”\r\nferment_ not more than one-fifth: and keeping the flasks for a longer\r\ntime in the oven had no effect in increasing the proportions of sugar\r\nfermented in these two last cases.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a great number of fermentations in mineral media, in\r\nconsequence of a circumstance which it may be interesting to mention\r\nhere. A person who was working in our laboratory asserted that the\r\nsuccess of our experiments depended upon the impurity of the sugar-candy\r\nwhich we employed, and that if this sugar had been pure—much purer than\r\nwas the ordinary, white, commercial sugar-candy, which up to that time\r\nwe had always used—the ferment could not have multiplied. The persistent\r\nobjections of our friend, and our desire to convince him, caused us to\r\nrepeat all our previous experiments on the subject, using sugar of great\r\npurity, which had been specially prepared for us, with the utmost care,\r\nby a skilful confectioner, Seugnot. The result only confirmed our former\r\nconclusions. Even this did not satisfy our obstinate friend, who went to\r\nthe trouble of preparing some pure sugar for himself, in little\r\ncrystals, by repeated crystallizations of carefully-selected commercial\r\nsugar-candy; he then repeated our experiments himself. This time all his\r\ndoubts were overcome. It even happened that the fermentations with the\r\nperfectly pure sugar instead of being slow were very active, when\r\ncompared with those which we had conducted with the commercial\r\nsugar-candy.\r\n\r\nWe may here add a few words on the non-transformation of yeast into\r\n_penicillium glaucum_.\r\n\r\nIf at any time during fermentation we pour off the fermenting liquid,\r\nthe deposit of yeast remaining in the vessel may continue there, in\r\ncontact with air, without our ever being able to discover the least\r\nformation of _penicillium glaucum_ in it. We may keep a current of pure\r\nair constantly passing through the flask; the experiment will give the\r\nsame result. Nevertheless, this is a medium peculiarly adapted to the\r\ndevelopment of this mould, inasmuch as if we introduce merely a few\r\nspores of _penicillium_, an abundant vegetation of that growth will\r\nafterwards appear on the deposit. The descriptions of Messrs. Turpin,\r\nHoffmann, and Trécul have, therefore, been based on one of these\r\nillusions which we meet with so frequently in microscopical\r\nobservations. When we laid these facts before the Academy,[159] M.\r\nTrécul professed his inability to comprehend them:[160]\r\n\r\n“According to M. Pasteur,” he said, “the yeast of beer is _anaërobian_,\r\nthat is to say, it lives in a liquid deprived of free oxygen; and to\r\nbecome _mycoderma_ or _penicillium_ it is above all things necessary\r\nthat it should be placed in air, since, without this, as the name\r\nsignifies, an aërobian being cannot exist. To bring about the\r\ntransformation of the yeast of beer into _mycoderma cerevisiæ_ or into\r\n_penicillium glaucum_, we must accept the conditions under which these\r\ntwo forms are obtained. If M. Pasteur will persist in keeping his yeast\r\nin media which are incompatible with the desired modification, it is\r\nclear that the results which he obtains must be always negative.”\r\n\r\nContrary to this perfectly gratuitous assertion of M. Trécul’s, we do\r\nnot keep our yeast in media which are calculated to prevent its\r\ntransformation into _penicillium_. As we have just seen, the principal\r\naim and object of our experiment was to bring this minute plant into\r\ncontact with air, and under conditions that would allow the\r\n_penicillium_ to develop with perfect freedom. We conducted our\r\nexperiments exactly as Turpin and Hoffmann conducted theirs, and exactly\r\nas they stipulate that such experiments should be conducted—with the one\r\nsole difference, indispensable to the correctness of our observations,\r\nthat we carefully guarded ourselves against those causes of error which\r\nthey did not take the least trouble to avoid. It is possible to produce\r\na ready entrance and escape of pure air in the case of the double-necked\r\nflasks which we have so often employed in the course of this work,\r\nwithout having recourse to the continuous passage of a current of air.\r\nHaving made a file-mark on the thin curved neck at a distance of two or\r\nthree centimetres (an inch) from the flask, we must cut round the neck\r\nat this point with a glazier’s diamond, and then remove it, taking care\r\nto cover the opening immediately with a sheet of paper which has been\r\npassed through the flame, and which we must fasten with a thread round\r\nthe part of the neck still left. In this manner we may increase or\r\nprolong the fructification of fungoid growths, or the life of aërobian\r\nferments in our flasks.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said of _penicillium glaucum_ will apply equally to\r\n_mycoderma cerevisiæ_. Notwithstanding what Turpin and Trécul may assert\r\nto the contrary, yeast, in contact with air as it was under the\r\nconditions of the experiment just described, will not yield _mycoderma\r\nvini_ or _mycoderma cerevisiæ_ any more than it will _penicillium_.\r\n\r\nThe experiments described in the preceding paragraphs on the increase of\r\norganized ferments in mineral media of the composition described, are of\r\ngreat physiological interest. Amongst other results, they show that all\r\nthe proteic matter of ferments may be produced by the vital activity of\r\nthe cells, which, apart altogether from the influence of light or free\r\noxygen (unless, indeed, we are dealing with aërobian moulds which\r\nrequire free oxygen), have the power of developing a chemical activity\r\nbetween carbo-hydrates, ammoniacal salts, phosphates and sulphates of\r\npotassium and magnesium. It may be admitted with truth that a similar\r\neffect obtains in the case of the higher plants, so that in the existing\r\nstate of science we fail to conceive what serious reason can be urged\r\nagainst our considering this effect as general. It would be perfectly\r\nlogical to extend the results of which we are speaking to all plants,\r\nand to believe that the proteic matter of vegetables, and perhaps of\r\nanimals also, is formed exclusively by the activity of the cells\r\noperating upon the ammoniacal and other mineral salts of the sap or\r\nplasma of the blood, and the carbo-hydrates, the formation of which, in\r\nthe case of the higher plants, requires only the concurrence of the\r\nchemical impulse of green light.\r\n\r\nViewed in this manner, the formation of the proteic substances would be\r\nindependent of the great act of reduction of carbonic acid gas under the\r\ninfluence of light. These substances would not be built up from the\r\nelements of water, ammonia, and carbonic acid gas, after the\r\ndecomposition of this last; they would be formed where they are found in\r\nthe cells themselves, by some process of union between the\r\ncarbo-hydrates imported by the sap, and the phosphates of potassium and\r\nmagnesium and salts of ammonia. Lastly, in vegetable growth, by means of\r\na carbo-hydrate and a mineral medium, since the carbo-hydrate is capable\r\nof many variations, and it would be difficult to understand how it could\r\nbe split up into its elements before serving to constitute the proteic\r\nsubstances, we may hope to obtain as many distinct proteic substances,\r\nand even cellulose substances, as there are carbo-hydrates. We have\r\ncommenced certain studies in this direction.\r\n\r\nIf solar radiation is indispensable to the decomposition of carbonic\r\nacid and the building up of the primary substances in the case of\r\nhigher vegetable life, it is still possible that certain inferior\r\norganisms may do without it and nevertheless yield the most complex\r\nsubstances, fatty or carbo-hydrate, such as cellulose, various organic\r\nacids, and proteic matter; not, however, by borrowing their carbon\r\nfrom the carbonic acid which is saturated with oxygen, but from other\r\nmatters still capable of acquiring oxygen, and so of yielding heat in\r\nthe process, such as alcohol and acetic acid, for example, to cite\r\nmerely carbon compounds most removed from organization. As these last\r\ncompounds, and a host of others equally adapted to serve as the\r\ncarbonaceous food of _mycoderms_ and the mucedines, may be produced\r\nsynthetically by means of carbon and the vapour of water, after the\r\nmethods that science owes to Berthelot, it follows that, in the case\r\nof certain inferior beings, life would be possible even if it should\r\nbe that the solar light was extinguished.[161]\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  It has been remarked in practice that fermentation is facilitated by\r\n  leaving the grapes on the bunches. The reason of this has not yet been\r\n  discovered. Still we have no doubt that it may be attributed,\r\n  principally, to the fact that the interstices between the grapes, and\r\n  the spaces which the bunch leaves throughout, considerably increase\r\n  the volume of air placed at the service of the germs of ferment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  [NaHSO_{2}, now called _Sodium hyposulphite_.

On the other hand, we\r\n  know that air normally contains, approximately, 1/5th its volume of\r\n  oxygen, the rest being nitrogen, so that, by ascertaining the\r\n  diminution of the proportion in the flask, we can find how many cubic\r\n  centimetres have been absorbed by the yeast. The author, however, has\r\n  not given all the _data_ necessary for accurate calculation.—D.C.R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  This number is probably too small; it is scarcely possible that the\r\n  increase of weight in the yeast, even under the exceptional conditions\r\n  of the experiment described, was not to some extent at least due to\r\n  oxidation apart from free oxygen, inasmuch as some of the cells were\r\n  covered by others. The increased weight of the yeast is always due to\r\n  the action of two distinct modes of vital energy—activity, namely, in\r\n  presence and activity in absence of air. We might endeavour to shorten\r\n  the duration of the experiment still further, in which case we would\r\n  still more assimilate the life of the yeast to that of ordinary\r\n  moulds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  In these experiments, in which the moulds remain for a long time in\r\n  contact with a saccharine wort out of contact with oxygen—the oxygen\r\n  being promptly absorbed by the vital action of the plant (see our\r\n  _Mémoire sur les Générations dites Spontanées_, p. 54, note)—there is\r\n  no doubt that an appreciable quantity of alcohol is formed because the\r\n  plant does not immediately lose its vital activity, after the\r\n  absorption of oxygen.\r\n\r\n  A 300-c.c. (10-oz.) flask, containing 100 c.c. of must, after the air\r\n  in it had been expelled by boiling, was opened and immediately\r\n  re-closed, on August 15th, 1873. A fungoid growth—a unique one, of\r\n  greenish-grey colour—developed from spontaneous impregnation, and\r\n  decolorized the liquid, which originally was of a yellowish-brown.\r\n  Some large crystals, sparkling like diamonds, of neutral tartrate of\r\n  lime, were precipitated. About a year afterwards, long after the death\r\n  of the plant, we examined this liquid. It contained 0·3 gramme (4·6\r\n  grains) of alcohol, and 0·053 gramme (0·8 grain) of vegetable matter,\r\n  dried at 100° C. (212° F.). We ascertained that the spores of the\r\n  fungus were dead at the moment when the flask was opened. When sown,\r\n  they did not develop in the least degree.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  We find in M. Raulin’s Note, already quoted, that “the minimum ratio\r\n  between the weight of sugar and the weight of organized matter, that\r\n  is, the weight of fungoid growth which it helps to form, may be\r\n  expressed 10/3·2 = 3·1.” JULES RAULIN, _Études chimiques sur la\r\n  végétation. Recherches sur le développement d’une mucédinée dans un\r\n  milieu artificiel_, p. 192, Paris, 1870. We have seen, in the case of\r\n  yeast, that this ratio may be as low as 4/1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  We shall show, some day, that the processes of oxidation due to growth\r\n  of fungi cause, in certain decompositions, liberation of ammonia to a\r\n  considerable extent, and that by regulating their action we might\r\n  cause them to extract the nitrogen from a host of organic _débris_, as\r\n  also, by checking the production of such organisms, we might\r\n  considerably increase the proportion of nitrates in the artificial\r\n  nitrogenous substances. By cultivating various moulds on the surface\r\n  of damp bread in a current of air, we have obtained an abundance of\r\n  ammonia, derived from the decomposition of the albuminoids effected by\r\n  the fungoid life. The decomposition of asparagus, and several other\r\n  animal or vegetable substances, has given similar results.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  To determine the absence of cells of ferment in fruits that have been\r\n  immersed in carbonic acid gas, we must first of all carefully raise\r\n  the pellicle of the fruit, taking care that the subjacent parenchyma\r\n  does not touch the surface of the pellicle, since the organized\r\n  corpuscles existing on the exterior of the fruit might introduce an\r\n  error into our microscopical observations. Experiments on grapes have\r\n  given us an explanation of a fact generally known, the cause of which,\r\n  however, had hitherto escaped our knowledge. We all know that the\r\n  taste and aroma of the vintage, that is, of the grapes stripped from\r\n  the bunches and thrown into tubs, where they get soaked in the juice\r\n  that issues from wounded specimens, are very different from the taste\r\n  and aroma of an uninjured bunch. Now grapes that have been immersed in\r\n  an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas have exactly the flavour and smell\r\n  of the vintage; the reason is that, in the vintage tub, the grapes are\r\n  immediately surrounded by an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, and\r\n  undergo, in consequence, the fermentation peculiar to grapes that have\r\n  been plunged in this gas. These facts deserve to be studied from a\r\n  practical point of view. It would be interesting, for example, to\r\n  learn what difference there would be in the quality of two wines, the\r\n  grapes of which, in the one case, had been perfectly crushed, so as to\r\n  cause as great a separation of the cells of the parenchyma as\r\n  possible; in the other case, left, for the most part, whole, as in the\r\n  case in the ordinary vintage. The first wine would be deprived of\r\n  those fixed and fragrant principles produced by the fermentation of\r\n  which we have just spoken, when the grapes are immersed in carbonic\r\n  acid gas. By such a comparison as that which we suggest, we should be\r\n  able to form an _à priori_ judgment on the merits of the new system,\r\n  which has not been carefully studied, although already widely adopted,\r\n  of milled, cylindrical crushers, for pressing the vintage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  We have sometimes found small quantities of alcohol in fruits and\r\n  other vegetable organs, surrounded with ordinary air, but always in\r\n  small proportion, and in a manner which suggested its accidental\r\n  character. It is easy to understand how, in the thickness of certain\r\n  fruits, certain parts of those fruits might be deprived of air, under\r\n  which circumstance they would have been acting under conditions\r\n  similar to those under which fruits act when wholly immersed in\r\n  carbonic acid gas. Moreover it would be useful to determine whether\r\n  alcohol is not a normal product of vegetation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  In these studies on plants living immersed in carbonic acid gas, we\r\n  have come across a fact which corroborates those which we have already\r\n  given in reference to the facility with which lactic and viscous\r\n  ferments, and, generally speaking, those which we have termed the\r\n  disease-ferments of beer, develop when deprived of air, and which\r\n  shows, consequently, how very marked their aërobian character is. If\r\n  we immerse beetroots or turnips in carbonic acid gas, we produce\r\n  well-defined fermentations in those roots. Their whole surface readily\r\n  permits the escape of the highly acid liquids, and they become filled\r\n  with lactic, viscous, and other ferments. This shows us the great\r\n  danger which may result from the use of pits, in which the beetroots\r\n  are preserved, when the air is not renewed, and that the original\r\n  oxygen is expelled by the vital processes of fungi, or other\r\n  deoxidizing chemical actions. We have directed the attention of the\r\n  manufacturers of beetroot sugar to this point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  LECHARTIER and BELLAMY, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_,\r\n  vol. lxix., pp. 366 and 466, 1869.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  Those gentlemen express themselves thus: “In a note presented to the\r\n  Academy in November, 1872, we published certain experiments which\r\n  showed that carbonic acid and alcohol may be produced in fruits kept\r\n  in a closed vessel, out of contact with atmospheric oxygen, without\r\n  our being able to discover alcoholic ferment in the interior of those\r\n  fruits.\r\n\r\n  “M. Pasteur, as a logical deduction from the principles which he has\r\n  established in connection with the theory of fermentation, considers\r\n  that _the formation of alcohol may be attributed to the fact that the\r\n  physical and chemical processes of life in the cells of fruit continue\r\n  under new conditions, in a manner similar to those of the cells of\r\n  ferment_. Experiments, continued during 1872, 1873, and 1874, on\r\n  different fruits, have furnished results all of which seem to us to\r\n  harmonize with this proposition, and to establish it on a firm basis\r\n  of proof.” _Comptes rendus_, t. lxxix., p. 949, 1874.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Faites nouveaux pour servir à la connaissance de la théorie\r\n  des fermentations proprement dites_.

See, in the same volume, the\r\n  discussion that followed; also, PASTEUR, _Note sur la production de\r\n  l’alcool par les fruits_, same volume, p. 1054, in which we recount\r\n  the observations anterior to our own, made by Messrs. Lechartier and\r\n  Bellamy in 1869.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  _Comptes rendus_, meeting of January 15th, 1872.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  As a matter of fact, M. Fremy applies his theory of hemi-organism, not\r\n  only to the alcoholic fermentation of grape juice, but to all other\r\n  fermentations. The following passage occurs in one of his Notes\r\n  (_Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, t. lxxv., p. 979, October 28th,\r\n  1872):\r\n\r\n  “_Experiments on Germinated Barley._—The object of these was to show\r\n  that, when barley, left to itself in sweetened water, produces in\r\n  succession alcoholic, lactic, butyric, and acetic fermentations, these\r\n  modifications are brought about by ferments which are produced inside\r\n  the grains themselves, and not by atmospheric germs. More than forty\r\n  different experiments were devoted to this part of my work.” Need we\r\n  add that this assertion is based on no substantial foundation? The\r\n  cells belonging to the grains of barley, or their albuminous contents,\r\n  never do produce cells of alcoholic ferment, or of lactic ferment, or\r\n  butyric vibrios. Whenever those ferments appear they may be traced to\r\n  germs of those organisms, diffused throughout the interior of the\r\n  grains, or adhering to their exterior surface, or existing in the\r\n  water employed, or on the sides of the vessels used. There are many\r\n  ways of demonstrating this, of which the following is one: since the\r\n  results of our experiments have shown that sweetened water,\r\n  phosphates, and chalk very readily give rise to lactic and butyric\r\n  fermentations, what reason is there for supposing that if we\r\n  substitute grains of barley for chalk, the lactic and butyric ferments\r\n  will spring from those grains, in consequence of a transformation of\r\n  their cells or albuminous substances? Surely, there is no ground for\r\n  maintaining that they are produced by hemi-organism, since a medium\r\n  composed of sugar, or chalk, or phosphates of ammonia, potash, or\r\n  magnesia contains no albuminous substances. This is an indirect but\r\n  irresistible argument against the hemi-organism theory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Mémoire sur la fermentation alcoolique_, 1860; _Annales de\r\n  Chimie et de Physique_. The word _globules_ is here used for _cells_.\r\n  In our researches we have always endeavoured to prevent any confusion\r\n  of ideas. We stated at the beginning of our Memoir of 1860, that: “We\r\n  apply the term _alcoholic_ to that fermentation which sugar undergoes\r\n  under the influence of the ferment known as _beer yeast_.” This is the\r\n  fermentation which produces wine and all alcoholic beverages. This,\r\n  too, is regarded as the type for a host of similar phenomena,\r\n  designated, by general usage, under the generic name of\r\n  _fermentation_, and qualified by the name of one of the essential\r\n  products of the special phenomenon under observation. Bearing in mind\r\n  this fact in reference to the nomenclature that we have adopted, it\r\n  will be seen that the expression _alcoholic fermentation_ cannot be\r\n  applied to every phenomenon of fermentation in which alcohol is\r\n  produced, inasmuch as there may be a number of phenomena having this\r\n  character in common. If we had not at starting defined that particular\r\n  one amongst the number of very distinct phenomena, which, to the\r\n  exclusion of the others, should bear the name _alcoholic\r\n  fermentation_, we should inevitably have given rise to a confusion of\r\n  language that would soon pass from words to ideas, and tend to\r\n  introduce unnecessary complexity into researches which are already, in\r\n  themselves, sufficiently complex to necessitate the adoption of\r\n  scrupulous care to prevent their becoming still more involved. It\r\n  seems to us that any further doubt as to the meaning of the words\r\n  _alcoholic fermentation_, and the sense in which they are employed, is\r\n  impossible, inasmuch as Lavoisier, Gay-Lussac, and Thénard have\r\n  applied this term to the fermentation of sugar by means of beer yeast.\r\n  It would be both dangerous and unprofitable to discard the example set\r\n  by those illustrious masters, to whom we are indebted for our earliest\r\n  knowledge of this subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  See, for example, the communications of MM. Colin and Poggiale, and\r\n  the discussion on them, in the _Bulletin de l’Académie de Médicine_,\r\n  March 2nd, 9th, and 30th, and February 16th and 23rd, 1875.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  We have elsewhere determined the formation of minute quantities of\r\n  volatile acids in alcoholic fermentation. M. Béchamp, who studied\r\n  these, recognized several belonging to the series of fatty acids,\r\n  acetic acid, butyric acid, &c. “The presence of succinic acid is not\r\n  accidental, but constant; if we put aside volatile acids that form in\r\n  quantities which we may call infinitely small, we may say that\r\n  succinic acid is the only normal acid of alcoholic fermentation.”\r\n  PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, t. xlvii. p. 224, 1858.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Traube’s conceptions were governed by a theory of fermentation\r\n  entirely his own, a hypothetical one, as he admits, of which the\r\n  following is a brief summary: “We have no reason to doubt,” Traube\r\n  says, “that the protoplasm of vegetable cells is itself, or contains\r\n  within it, a chemical ferment which causes the alcoholic fermentation\r\n  of sugar; its efficacy seems closely connected with the presence of\r\n  the cell, inasmuch as, up to the present time, we have discovered no\r\n  means of isolating it from the cells with success. In the presence of\r\n  air, this ferment oxidizes sugar, by bringing oxygen to bear upon it;\r\n  in the absence of air it decomposes the sugar by taking away oxygen\r\n  from one group of atoms of the molecule of sugar and bringing it to\r\n  act upon other atoms; on the one hand yielding a product of alcohol by\r\n  reduction, on the other hand a product of carbonic acid by oxidation.”\r\n\r\n  Traube supposes that this chemical ferment exists in yeast and in all\r\n  sweet fruits, but only when the cells are intact, for he has proved\r\n  for himself that thoroughly crushed fruits give rise to no\r\n  fermentation whatever in carbonic acid gas. In this respect this\r\n  imaginary chemical ferment would differ entirely from those which we\r\n  call _soluble ferments_, since diastase, emulsine, &c., may be easily\r\n  isolated.\r\n\r\n  For a full account of the views of Brefeld and Traube, and the\r\n  discussion which they carried on on the subject of the results of our\r\n  experiments, our readers may consult the _Journal of the Chemical\r\n  Society of Berlin_, vii. p. 872. The numbers for September and\r\n  December, 1874, in the same volume, contain the replies of the two\r\n  authors.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  See PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, t. lvi. p.\r\n  416.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  [Carbonic acid being considerably more soluble than other gases\r\n  possible under the circumstances.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  We had to avoid filling the small flask completely, for fear of\r\n  causing some of the liquid to pass on to the surface of the mercury in\r\n  the measuring tube. The liquid condensed by boiling forms pure water,\r\n  the solvent affinity of which for carbonic acid, at the temperature we\r\n  employ, is well known.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  The following is a curious consequence of these numbers and of the\r\n  nature of the products of this fermentation. The carbonic acid\r\n  liberated being quite pure, especially when the liquid has been boiled\r\n  to expel all air from the flask, and capable of perfect solution, it\r\n  follows that, the volume of liquid being sufficient and the weight of\r\n  tartrate suitably chosen—we may set aside tartrate of lime in an\r\n  insoluble, crystalline powder, along with phosphates at the bottom of\r\n  a closed vessel full of water, and find soon afterwards in their place\r\n  carbonate of lime, and, in the liquid, soluble salts of lime, with a\r\n  mass of organic matter at the bottom, without any liberation of gas or\r\n  appearance of fermentation ever taking place, except as far as the\r\n  vital action and transformation in the tartrate are concerned. It is\r\n  easy to calculate that a vessel or flask of five litres (rather more\r\n  than a gallon) would be large enough for the accomplishment of this\r\n  remarkable and singularly quiet transformation, in the case of fifty\r\n  grammes (767 grains) of tartrate of lime.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  We treated the whole deposit with dilute hydrochloric acid, which\r\n  dissolved the carbonate of lime, and the insoluble phosphates of\r\n  calcium and magnesium; afterwards filtering the liquid through a\r\n  weighed filter paper. Dried at 100° C. (212° F.), the weight of\r\n  organic matter thus obtained was 0·54 gramme (8·3 grains), which was\r\n  rather more than 1/200th of the weight of fermentable matter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Should the solution of lactate of lime be turbid, it may be clarified\r\n  by filtration, after previously adding a small quantity of phosphate\r\n  of ammonia, which throws down phosphate of lime. It is only after this\r\n  process of clarification and filtration that the phosphates of the\r\n  formula are added. The solution soon becomes turbid, if left in\r\n  contact with air, in consequence of the spontaneous formation of\r\n  bacteria.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  The naturalist Cohn, of Breslau, who published an excellent work on\r\n  bacteria in 1872, described, after Mayer, the composition of a liquid\r\n  peculiarly adapted to the propagation of these organisms, which it\r\n  would be well to compare for its utility in studies of this kind with\r\n  our solution of lactate and phosphates. The following is Cohn’s\r\n  formula:—\r\n\r\n             Distilled water          20 c.c. (0·7 fl. oz.)\r\n\r\n             Phosphate of          0·1 gramme (1·5 grains).\r\n             potassium\r\n\r\n             Sulphate of           0·1 gramme (1·5 grains).\r\n             magnesium\r\n\r\n             Tribasic phosphate   0·01 gramme (0·15 grain).\r\n             of lime\r\n\r\n             Tartrate of ammonia     0·2 gramme (3 grains).\r\n\r\n  This liquid, the author says, has a feeble acid reaction and forms a\r\n  perfectly clear solution.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  On the rapid absorption of oxygen by bacteria, see also our _Mémoire_\r\n  of 1872, _sur les Générations dites Spontanées_, especially the note\r\n  on page 78.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  In what way are we to account for so great a difference between the\r\n  two fermentations that we have just described? Probably, it was owing\r\n  to some modification effected in the medium by the previous life of\r\n  the bacteria, or to the special character of the vibrios used in\r\n  impregnation. Or, again, it might have been due to the action of the\r\n  air, which, under the conditions of our second experiment, was not\r\n  absolutely eliminated, since we took no precaution against its\r\n  introduction at the moment of filling our flask, and this would tend\r\n  to facilitate the multiplication of anaërobian vibrios, just as, under\r\n  similar conditions, would have been the case if we had been dealing\r\n  with a fermentation by ordinary yeast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  In this case the liquid was composed as follows:—a saturated solution\r\n  of lactate of lime, at a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.) was prepared,\r\n  containing for every 100 c.c. (3-½ fl. oz.) 25·65 grammes (394 grains)\r\n  of the lactate, C_{6}H_{5}O_{5}_Ca_O [_new notation_,\r\n  C_{6}H_{10}_Ca_O_{6}]. This solution was rendered very clear by the\r\n  addition of one gramme of phosphate of ammonia and subsequent\r\n  filtration. For a volume of 8 litres (14 pints) of this clear,\r\n  saturated solution, we used [1 gramme = 15·43 grains]:—\r\n\r\n                   Phosphate of ammonia 2 grammes.\r\n\r\n                   Phosphate of         1 grammes.\r\n                   potassium\r\n\r\n                   Phosphate of         1 grammes.\r\n                   magnesium\r\n\r\n                   Sulphate of ammonia  0·5 gramme.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  [1 millimetre = 0·039 inch: hence the dimensions indicated will\r\n  be—length, from 0·00039 to 0·00117, or even 0·00176 in.; diameter,\r\n  from 0·000058 to 0·000078, rarely 0.000117 in.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  The carbonaceous supply, as we remarked, had failed them, and to this\r\n  failure the absence of vital action, nutrition, and multiplication was\r\n  attributable. The liquid, however, contained butyrate of lime, a salt\r\n  possessing properties similar to those of the lactate. Why could not\r\n  this salt equally well support the life of the vibrios? The\r\n  explanation of the difficulty seems to us to lie simply in the fact\r\n  that lactic acid produces heat by its decomposition, whilst butyric\r\n  acid does not, and the vibrios seem to require heat daring the\r\n  chemical process of their nutrition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  To do this, it is sufficient first to fill the curved ends of the\r\n  stop-cocked tubes of the flasks, as well as the india-rubber tube _c\r\n  c_, which connects them, with boiling water that contains no air.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  We find this fact, which we published as long ago as 1863, confirmed\r\n  in a work of H. Hoffmann’s published in 1869, under the title _Mémoire\r\n  sur les bactéries_, which has appeared in French (_Annales des\r\n  Sciences naturelles_, 5th series, vol. xi.). On this subject we may\r\n  cite an observation that has not yet been published. Aërobian bacteria\r\n  lose all power of movement when suddenly plunged into carbonic acid\r\n  gas; they recover it, however, as if they had only been suffering from\r\n  anæsthesia, as soon as they are brought into the air again.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  These doubts might easily be removed by putting the matter to the test\r\n  of direct experiment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  ROBIN, _Sur la nature des fermentations_, &c.

As a matter of fact, if we pass a strong\r\n  current of carbonic acid through the sugared water and the water in\r\n  which the yeast has been treated, the fermentation will be rendered\r\n  extremely sluggish, and the few new cells of yeast which form will\r\n  assume strange and abnormal aspects. Indeed this might have been\r\n  expected, for we have seen that yeast, when somewhat old, is incapable\r\n  of development or of causing fermentation, even in a fermentable\r\n  medium containing all the nutritive principles of yeast, if the liquid\r\n  has been deprived of air; much more should we expect this to be the\r\n  case in pure sugared water, likewise deprived of air.\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  DOEBEREINER, _Journal de Chimie de Schweigger_, vol. xii. p. 129, and\r\n  _Journal de Pharmacie_, vol. i. p. 342.\r\n\r\n  MITSCHERLICH, _Monatsberichte d.

Rose, published in 1840, M. Mitscherlich observed: “The inversion\r\n  of cane sugar in alcoholic fermentation is not due to the globules of\r\n  yeast, but to a soluble matter in the water with which they mix. The\r\n  liquid obtained by straining off the ferment on a filter paper,\r\n  possesses the property of converting cane sugar into uncrystallizable\r\n  sugar.”\r\n\r\n  BERTHELOT, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_. Meeting of May 28th, 1860.\r\n  M. Berthelot confirms the preceding experiment of Mitscherlich, and\r\n  proves, moreover, that the soluble matter of which that author speaks\r\n  may be precipitated with alcohol without losing its invertive power.\r\n\r\n  M. Béchamp has applied Mitscherlich’s observation, concerning the\r\n  soluble fermentative part of yeast, to fungoid growths, and has made\r\n  the interesting discovery that fungoid growths, like yeast, yield to\r\n  water a substance that inverts sugar. When the production of fungoid\r\n  growths is prevented by means of an antiseptic the inversion of sugar\r\n  does not take place.\r\n\r\n  We may here say a few words respecting M. Béchamp’s claim to priority\r\n  of discovery. It is a well-known fact that we were the first to\r\n  demonstrate that living ferments might be completely developed, if\r\n  their germs were placed in pure water, together with sugar, ammonia,\r\n  and phosphates. Relying on this established fact, that moulds are\r\n  capable of development in sweetened water, in which, according to M.\r\n  Béchamp, they invert the sugar, our author asserts that he has proved\r\n  that, “living organized ferments may originate in media which contain\r\n  no albuminous substances.” (See _Comptes rendus_, vol. lxxv. p. 1519.)\r\n  To be logical, M. Béchamp might say that he has proved that certain\r\n  moulds originate in pure sweetened water, without nitrogen or\r\n  phosphates or other mineral elements, for such a deduction might very\r\n  well be drawn from his work, in which we do not find the least\r\n  expression of astonishment at the possibility of moulds developing in\r\n  pure water, containing nothing but sugar without other mineral or\r\n  organic principles.\r\n\r\n  M. Béchamp’s first Note on the inversion of sugar was published in\r\n  1855. In it we find nothing relating to the influence of moulds. His\r\n  second, in which that influence is noticed, was published in January,\r\n  1858, that is, subsequently to our work on lactic fermentation, which\r\n  appeared in November, 1857. In that work we established, for the first\r\n  time, that the lactic ferment is a living organized being, that\r\n  albuminous substances have no share in the production of fermentation,\r\n  and that they only serve as the food of the ferment. M. Béchamp’s Note\r\n  was even subsequent to our first work on alcoholic fermentation, which\r\n  appeared on December 21st, 1857. It is since the appearance of these\r\n  two works of ours that the preponderating influence of the life of\r\n  microscopic organisms, in the phenomena of fermentation, has been\r\n  better understood. Immediately after their appearance M. Béchamp, who,\r\n  from 1855, had made no observation on the action of fungoid growths on\r\n  sugar, although he had remarked their presence, modified his former\r\n  conclusions. (_Comptes rendus_, January 4th, 1858.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  “There are two classes of ferments; the first, of which the yeast of\r\n  beer may be taken as the type, perpetuate and renew themselves if they\r\n  can find in the liquid in which they produce fermentation food enough\r\n  for their wants; the second, of which diastase is the type, always\r\n  sacrifice themselves in the exercise of their activity.” (DUMAS,\r\n  _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, t. lxxv. p. 277, 1872.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  FREMY, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, vol. lviii. p. 1065, 1864.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  See our Memoir of 1860 (_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, vol.\r\n  lviii.) p. 61, and following, and especially pp. 69 and 70, where the\r\n  details of the experiment will be found.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, vol. lxxiii. p.\r\n  1419, 1871.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  In his Memoir of 1870, Liebig has made a remarkable admission: “My\r\n  late friend Pelouze,” he says, “had communicated to me, nine years\r\n  ago, certain results of M. Pasteur’s researches on fermentation. I\r\n  told him that, just then, I was not disposed to alter my opinion on\r\n  the cause of fermentation, and that if it were possible by means of\r\n  ammonia to produce or multiply the yeast in fermenting liquors,\r\n  industry would soon avail itself of the fact, and that I would wait to\r\n  see if it did so; up to the present time, however, there has not been\r\n  the least change in the manufacture of yeast.” We do not know what M.\r\n  Pelouze’s reply was; but it is not difficult to conceive so sagacious\r\n  an observer remarking to his illustrious friend, that the possibility\r\n  of deriving pecuniary advantage from the wide application of a new\r\n  scientific fact had never been regarded as the criterion of the\r\n  exactness of that fact. We could prove, moreover, by the undoubted\r\n  testimony of very distinguished practical men, notably by that of M.\r\n  Pezeyre, director of distilleries, that upon this point also Liebig\r\n  was mistaken.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, vol. lxxviii. pp. 213-216.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  TRÉCUL, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie_, vol. lxxviii. pp. 217, 218.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  See on this subject the verbal observations which we addressed to the\r\n  Academy of Sciences, at its meetings of April 10th and 24th, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                New Process for the Manufacture of Beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles established in the course of this work implicitly involve\r\nthe conditions of a new process of manufacture, the essential feature of\r\nwhich would consist in the production of a beer of excellent keeping\r\nqualities, we might even say a beer that could not undergo alteration.\r\nIt will not be difficult now to make ourselves clear on the point.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in the first place, that the changes which take place in\r\nthe ferment, the wort, and the beer itself, are due to the presence of\r\nmicroscopic organisms of an entirely different character to that of the\r\nferment-cells properly so called, which organisms, by simultaneously\r\ngiving rise, in the course of their multiplication in the wort, ferment,\r\nor beer, to other products, make the materials difficult to keep or\r\neffect their deterioration. Again, we have seen that these\r\nchange-producing organisms, the ferments of disease, never arise\r\nspontaneously in the wort or beer, but, whenever they make their\r\nappearance in these fluids, have been imported from without, either in\r\ncompany with the yeast, or from accession of atmospheric dust, or from\r\ncontact with the vessels, or from the materials themselves which the\r\nbrewer uses in his manufacture. Moreover, we know that these\r\ndisease-ferments, or their germs, are destroyed when the wort has its\r\ntemperature raised to the boiling-point. And, following up the\r\ninferences from such facts, we have seen that wort exposed to pure air,\r\nafter having been heated to boiling, remains absolutely free of any sort\r\nof fermentation.\r\n\r\nInasmuch then as the disease-germs of wort and beer are destroyed in the\r\ncopper in which the wort is boiled, and as, by employing a perfectly\r\npure ferment, we guard against the admission of any foreign ferment of\r\nan evil character, we have it in our power to prepare a beer which shall\r\nbe incapable of undergoing any pernicious fermentation whatsoever. This\r\nwe shall have effected provided we can take the wort as run off from the\r\ncoppers, cool and manipulate it out of contact with ordinary air or in\r\ncontact with pure air, charge it with a pure yeast, and, lastly, store\r\nthe beer when the fermentation is complete in vessels thoroughly\r\npurified from disease-ferments.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     § I.—Preliminary Experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may readily satisfy ourselves as to the truth of these inferences.\r\nThe following is one of the earliest experiments which I devised with a\r\nview to establish their certainty. Into a flask with a straight neck of\r\nabout a litre (1-3/4 pints) capacity, a quantity of wort from a brewery\r\nwas introduced and there raised to boiling, and whilst the vapour still\r\nissued from the neck of the flask, connection was made with a two-necked\r\nflask in which the cultivation of pure yeast had been carried on. The\r\ncork and glass tube used for this purpose had previously been treated\r\nwith boiling water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\nWhen the wort had cooled down in the flask and matters were arranged as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 75, I raised the two-necked flask so as to cause a\r\nlittle of the liquid and yeast to flow into the wort. Thereupon\r\nfermentation was set up, and the resulting carbonic acid gas made its\r\nescape by the drawn-out end of the doubled-necked flask. The entire\r\narrangement with its supporting stand remained in this connection for\r\neighteen months, sometimes on a stove, sometimes in the laboratory,\r\nexposed to all the variations of external temperature. At the end of\r\nthat time I tasted the beer in the flask; it was perfectly sound, and\r\nthe ferment, submitted to the microscope, showed not the slightest trace\r\nof any foreign ferments: and, doubtless, the experiment might have been\r\nprotracted over any number of years with the same result.\r\n\r\nThe only change that occurs in course of time is the appearance in the\r\nneck of the flask at the surface of the beer of a deposit of small\r\nprominences resembling a crystallization, but which really consists of\r\nthose forms of ferment to which in Chapter V. I attached the name of\r\n_aërobian ferment_. The beer, after being transferred to a bottle that\r\nhad been washed with hot water, was kept for several months in the heat\r\nof summer, without exhibiting the slightest trace of deterioration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions of the preceding experiment can readily be\r\nrealized on the large scale. For this purpose we may employ the\r\napparatus in the above sketch (Figs. 76 and 77) constructed of tin or\r\ntinned copper. As appears from the sketch, this consists of a\r\ncylindrical tub resting on a support, and closed at the top by a cover,\r\nwhose lower edge fits into a gutter containing water. The wort prepared\r\nin the copper is led into the cylinder, a process which does not\r\nmaterially lower its temperature. Now we know that wort in breweries\r\nwhich has been cooled in contact with the air, and so got charged with\r\ndisease-germs, will, nevertheless, recover its faculty of keeping for\r\nany length of time in pure air, if we again raise its temperature to 80°\r\nC. (176° F.) or even 70° or 75° C. (158°, 167° F.) Having filled the tub\r\nwith the hot wort and put on the lid, we then connect, by means of a\r\ncaoutchouc tube _c d_, the metal tube _a c_ (which opens into one of the\r\ntubulures projecting above the lid) with the system of tubes _d e_, _f\r\ng_, of which _d e_ is fixed to the cylinder; _e f_ is a caoutchouc\r\njunction connecting _e_ with the bent glass tube _g_. We then dash over\r\nthe apparatus, lid, tubulures, and their corks a quantity of boiling\r\nwater. This collects in the gutter in which the lid rests, and any\r\nexcess overflows into a second gutter outside the first, where, however,\r\nit cannot remain, but passes away by means of a ring of small holes\r\nbetween the base of the outer trough _i i_ and the cylinder. The\r\noverflow is collected in a third trough at the bottom, whence it can be\r\nremoved by a pipe M. T is a bent thermometer to indicate the temperature\r\nof the wort; its bulb is protected by an inlet socket _d d_, pierced\r\nwith holes; _r_ is a stopcock for discharging the water in the gutter,\r\nwhich serves as a hydraulic junction between the cylinder and its lid;\r\nR, V, are stopcocks, or openings for the discharge of the liquid in the\r\ncylinder and its deposit. The next process is to cool the vessel, which\r\nmay be done either by leaving it to itself, or by introducing a current\r\nof cold water through the tubulure E, soldered on to the lid. This\r\ntubulure is of the form of an inverted funnel, and is pierced at the\r\nbottom with a close row of holes, through which the cold water issues in\r\na sheet over the surface of the cover. In whichever way the cooling is\r\neffected, the external air continues all the time to enter the vessel\r\nbeneath the lid by way of the long, narrow passage _g f e d c a_, and\r\nmust necessarily get purified by depositing in its course all\r\nfungoid-germs, just as happened in the case of the two-necked flask of\r\nair experiments. This, however, may be still further secured by\r\nintroducing a small plug of cotton wool, or asbestos, into the end of\r\nthe tube _g_.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which we have carried out with this apparatus have\r\nproved that, by adopting such an arrangement, beer, a liquid peculiarly\r\nliable to change, may be kept as long as we wish, for weeks or months,\r\nin contact with air, since the tube _g_ is open, without evincing the\r\nleast symptom of disease. It matters little whether the leaves and\r\nstrobiles of the hops are introduced with the hot wort or strained off;\r\nthe result is the same. On the other hand, a leak in the apparatus from\r\nwhich the wort gets mixed with ordinary water from outside during\r\ncooling, will speedily effect a change in the wort and cause it to swarm\r\nwith vibrios, or butyric ferment, lactic ferment, and other germs of\r\ndisease, whilst its taste will be rendered extremely nauseous. It can\r\nonly be through one’s own fault, that is, from want of skill in carrying\r\nout the operation, that any change can be brought about by the water in\r\nthe gutter not being kept out of the fermenting vessel. That water may\r\neven become putrid without the organisms contained in it being able to\r\nreach the wort in the fermenting vessel. The apparatus may be of any\r\nsize whatever; we have worked with vessels containing 12 hectolitres\r\nwith as much ease and certainty as when we used an apparatus of 1\r\nhectolitre (22 gallons).\r\n\r\nIt is easy to carry out the process of cooling in the presence of\r\ncarbonic acid gas if we fit a bent tube, similar to _a c d e f g_, to\r\nthe second tubulure D. Through this tube, or its companion, the gas can\r\nbe passed as it issues from an apparatus in which it is generated, or\r\nfrom a gasometer filled with it, or from a vessel of beer undergoing\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no necessity that the cooling should take place in the\r\nfermenting vessel. It may be effected separately, in vessels of greater\r\nor less depth, in spiral coils surrounded with cold water, or in any\r\nkind of refrigerator, provided always that the conditions of purity are\r\nsatisfied, and that the flow of the cooled wort takes place under the\r\nsame conditions. Jets of steam, which are already extensively used for\r\nthe cleansing of pipes in breweries, may be employed here with great\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe pitching may be effected in various ways. A two-necked flask of a\r\ncapacity of from 200 to 300 cc. (about 7 to 10 fl. ozs.), in which not\r\nmore than 100 cc. (3-½ fl. ozs.) of wort has been fermented, will be\r\nsufficient for an apparatus of 1 hectolitre (22 gallons), although the\r\nflask may not contain more than 1 or 2 decigrammes (1-½ to 3 grains) of\r\nyeast. In the manufacture of beer, as at present conducted, the\r\nemployment of so minute a quantity of yeast would lead to most\r\ndisastrous results. The fermentation would unfailingly become lactic and\r\nbutyric, since the foreign germs with which commercial worts and yeasts\r\nare always contaminated would have ample time to develop during the\r\nfirst twenty-four or forty-eight hours, whilst the small quantity of\r\nyeast used in the pitching could scarcely do more than begin to develop\r\nduring that time. It is simply with the object of avoiding these\r\nsecondary fermentations that the brewer uses large quantities of yeast\r\nfor pitching.\r\n\r\nAfter the wort and yeast have been _pulled up_,[163] a process which\r\nevery practical brewer adopts after pitching, every part of the liquid\r\nis occupied by a multitude of yeast-cells, which seize upon the oxygen\r\nin solution, germinate with activity, turn to their own account the\r\nfood-supplies most easily assimilated, and prevent the growth of the\r\ngerms of disease-ferments. In the new process which we are now\r\nexplaining, things happen quite differently. Our wort is pure, and our\r\nyeast is pure, and if only a single cell of yeast were introduced into\r\nthe wort, the vital activity of this would be sufficient to bring about\r\nalcoholic fermentation, and to transform the wort into beer, without our\r\nhaving the least reason to apprehend the simultaneous development of any\r\nother organisms whatsoever. In short, the new process enables us to\r\npitch with as small a quantity of yeast as we like. It is, nevertheless,\r\ninexpedient to employ too minute a quantity, since by doing so we should\r\nretard the commencement of fermentation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of an apparatus of 5 hectolitres (110 gallons) or double\r\nthat capacity, the pitching may be accomplished by means of flasks\r\nholding from 4 to 9 litres (from 7 to 10 or 11 pints), (Fig. 79), or\r\ncopper cans, tinned inside, holding from 10 to 15 litres (2-1/4 to 3-1/4\r\ngallons), and provided at the upper conical end with glass tubes (Fig.\r\n78). The vessel must be half or two-thirds filled with wort. For this\r\npurpose it will be well always to employ wort that has been preserved in\r\nbottles by Appert’s process. We must use a stopper provided with tubes,\r\nas represented in Fig. 79: _a b_ is a glass stopper which closes the\r\nindia-rubber tube _b c_; _m n p_ is a fine glass tube, or, better still,\r\nmade of copper.\r\n\r\nThe tap R being closed, a long india-rubber tube is attached to the\r\nextremity of the curved tube, and the flask is completely immersed in a\r\nhot-water bath; the india-rubber tube projects from the bath and keeps\r\nthe interior of the vessel in communication with the external\r\natmosphere. If the tube _m n p_ is of copper, we may avail ourselves of\r\nits flexibility and bend it upwards, so as to place its open extremity\r\noutside the bath. The water in the bath is then gradually raised to a\r\ntemperature of 100° C. (212° F.), at which it is kept for a quarter or\r\nhalf an hour. In the case of copper cans, it is more convenient to place\r\nthem over a gas-heater. They may be treated in the same manner as the\r\nflasks with curved necks. Vessels prepared in this manner may remain in\r\na laboratory, or in any part of a brewery, for an indefinite time,\r\nwithout the wort in them undergoing the least change. It gradually\r\ndarkens in colour through a direct oxidation of a purely chemical\r\nnature, but no tendency to disease will manifest itself.\r\n\r\nSome days before we require to pitch an apparatus of several\r\nhectolitres, we impregnate one of these flasks or cans.[164] For this\r\npurpose we pass the flame of a spirit lamp over the tubes _c b a_ and _m\r\nn p_, to destroy the particles of dust that might pass inside at the\r\nmoment when the stopper _a b_ is taken out, and then by means of a long,\r\nstraight glass tube we take some of the liquid from a flask or vessel\r\ncontaining pure beer in a state of fermentation, and let a few drops of\r\nthis, with the yeast that it holds in suspension, fall into the flask or\r\ncan; the stopper _a b_ is once more passed through the flame and then\r\nreplaced; generally in the course of one or two days the yeast develops\r\nin the flask sufficiently for the fermentation to show itself. We may\r\nshorten the operation still further by emptying into the can the\r\ncontents of one of those double-necked flasks. To do this, we have\r\nsimply to attach the straight tube of the flask to the india-rubber _b\r\nc_, and pour the liquid in. In a similar manner we introduce, through\r\none of the tubulures surmounting the lid of the fermenting apparatus,\r\nthe contents of the flasks or cans, either whilst they are still in\r\nactive fermentation, or after fermentation is over. For this purpose,\r\nthe tap R is connected by means of an india-rubber tube (Fig. 79), with\r\na tube passing through a cork fixed in one of the tubulures of the large\r\napparatus. All this may be done in considerably less time than we have\r\ntaken to describe it; and the operation may be performed accurately and\r\nsafely by any one who has witnessed it a few times, even though he may\r\nnot be skilled in chemical manipulations, especially if he takes care to\r\nbear in mind the very simple principles which we have explained.\r\n\r\nSince certain parts of the apparatus—the outer opening of the tap, or\r\nthe india-rubber tubing, for example—may contract particles of dust from\r\nthe air, those parts, before being used, must be boiled in water, or\r\nwashed with boiling water, or passed through the flame of a spirit lamp,\r\nto destroy the germs mixed with the particles of dust that settle upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe method of cooling the wort in contact with carbonic acid prevents\r\naccess of oxygen to the latter up to the time of pitching, so that the\r\ndevelopment of the yeast takes place apart from the influence of oxygen.\r\nNow, we know that these conditions necessitate the employment of a very\r\nyoung yeast—a yeast that is in course of active germination, such as may\r\nbe taken from an incipient preparatory fermentation. Nevertheless, even\r\nwith this, the development of the yeast under such conditions is\r\nextremely slow, and the fermentation takes from fifteen to twenty-five\r\ndays; whilst, under the same circumstances, but with an aerated wort, it\r\nwould be finished in from eight to twelve days. This is a considerable\r\ndrawback, but, perhaps, a still more serious inconvenience is that the\r\nbeer takes much longer to clarify, and does so with greater difficulty\r\nthan those beers which are made with aerated worts. At the same time,\r\nthis is largely compensated by the superior quality of the beer, which\r\nis stronger and has greater fulness on the palate, whilst the aroma of\r\nthe hops is preserved to an extent never found in beers brewed by the\r\nordinary process. Besides this, the yeast deposited at the bottom of the\r\nfermenting vessel is much less active, and, being of an older type, is\r\nrevived with greater difficulty than that which forms in aerated worts.\r\nThis, which might be considered a disadvantage, if we had to employ the\r\nyeast afterwards for pitching, has the great advantage of giving a beer\r\nwhich, when racked, undergoes its secondary fermentation only slowly,\r\nand with difficulty.[165] A beer of this kind is better adapted than\r\nordinary beer to stand a long journey without developing great pressure\r\ninside the casks, and, if bottled, it will contain very little deposit,\r\nand will not froth violently when uncorked. The reason is, that a yeast\r\nis the more active, the more ready to multiply rapidly, and to work\r\nvigorously the more highly aerated the wort was in which it was grown.\r\nOn the other hand, a yeast formed apart from air readily gets exhausted,\r\nand may even perish in the liquid in which it ferments, when that is\r\nkept out of contact with air; in other words, the vital action of yeast\r\nis more restricted when it has not been subjected to the action of\r\noxygen during its formation.\r\n\r\nIf a great depth of wort, the surface of which alone is in contact with\r\natmospheric air, is left to cool down, it will act in almost exactly the\r\nsame manner as that which is cooled under an atmosphere of carbonic acid\r\ngas, because the oxygen of the air is very slow in pervading wort that\r\nis undisturbed. The gas will be taken into solution by the upper layer\r\nonly, whilst the bulk of the liquid will remain unaffected by it. In\r\nsome experiments which we conducted in a vessel which contained wort to\r\na depth of 70 centimetres (27·5 inches), and which was provided with a\r\ntap that enabled us to draw off some of the liquid every day, until we\r\nhad reduced the depth to 35 centimetres, we found, at the end of eight\r\ndays, that there was not a trace of oxygen in solution at the latter\r\ndepth. It is even probable that, considering the slow diffusion of the\r\noxygen, on the one hand, and the combination that may take place between\r\nit and certain components of the malt, on the other hand, it would take\r\na long time for all the wort, if undisturbed and of a certain depth, to\r\nbecome saturated with oxygen. In the vessel represented in Figs. 76 and\r\n77 there is a considerable depth of wort to cool down. Nevertheless, the\r\nmere fact of the possibility of an aeration from the surface, whilst the\r\nwort is cooling down in contact with pure air, is enough to account for\r\na certain effect that is produced on the yeast, later on, for the more\r\nyouthful appearance of the yeast of the deposit, compared with that\r\nwhich we find in the case of wort cooled in the presence of carbonic\r\nacid gas. The difference between the results is particularly striking\r\nif, in both cases, we follow up microscopically the development of the\r\nyeast during the first few days succeeding the pitching.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the air on fermentation is considerable. In the\r\nordinary process of brewing, fermentations would be almost impossible,\r\nand in every case most defective, if the wort, before being run into the\r\nfermenting vessels, were not aerated by its passage over the “coolers,”\r\nwhere the aeration is more or less effective, according as the liquid is\r\nmore or less shallow. Worts and yeasts being impure, that is containing\r\nthe germs of foreign ferments, those germs would have time to germinate\r\nin the fermenting vessels during the delay that the want of aeration in\r\nthe wort would cause in the development of the yeast. We are aware that\r\nseveral inventions have been proposed to do away with the coolers, and\r\nwe feel convinced that the object has been to remedy irregularities in\r\nfermentation. Considering the facts which we have published[166] on the\r\ndevelopment of yeast in the presence of air, and its inactivity in\r\nnon-aerated media, such inventions ought to be supplemented by some\r\nmeans of further aeration for the prevention of the mischief that they\r\nmust otherwise cause. In the existing process of brewing, the employment\r\nof coolers is a necessity.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the air on the vital action of the yeast may be proved\r\nin ways innumerable. The following is an experiment which we have often\r\ncarried out with surprising results. A fermentation is going on; we draw\r\noff the liquid as rapidly as we please, and pour it back again into the\r\nvessel immediately. Within an hour we find a marked increase in the\r\nfermentation, evidenced by the liberation of a greater quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid gas. This experiment may be performed with especial ease\r\nif we use the fermenting apparatus that we have described, for, by\r\nfitting a gas measurer to the escape tube _a b c d e f g_, the number of\r\nlitres produced before the drawing off of the liquid may be compared\r\nwith those obtained after. The least physical change in the running of\r\nthe fermenting liquid whilst it is being drawn off, modifies the effect\r\nin question; such as change in the diameter of the stream, the height\r\nfrom which it falls, its greater or less scattering in falling, all\r\ninfluence it. Again, as might be expected from such results,\r\ncorresponding modifications take place in the cells of yeast which come\r\nunder the influence of the air. They become firmer in aspect and\r\noutline, their plasma becomes fuller, assumes a younger and more\r\ntransparent aspect, and the vacuoles disappear. The molecular\r\ngranulations, too, are less apparent. At a certain focus they disappear;\r\nat another they reappear, not as black spots, however, but as brilliant\r\npoints so small as to be scarcely perceptible. If germination has been\r\nsuspended it is resumed; in short, everything tends to prove—and having\r\nthe yeast actually under our eyes we cannot doubt the fact—that the life\r\nof the cells is more decided, and the work of nutrition more active\r\nafter they have been brought into contact with the oxygen of the air,\r\nand have absorbed a greater or less quantity of that gas.\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinary conditions of brewing, the atmospheric air is present\r\nin very varying quantities, whether introduced by the wort which holds\r\nmore or less in solution, or by diffusion over the surface of the\r\nvessels, so that the same cells of yeast live by turns without air and\r\nwith air. At first they absorb all the oxygen held in solution, and\r\nmultiply under the influence of this absorption. Afterwards, when the\r\nsupply has been exhausted, and various assimilations have resulted from\r\nit, they are deprived of it. Their life continues apart from oxygen, and\r\nif the vessel were closed, fermentation would be accomplished under\r\nthese conditions, although more slowly. The vessel being open, a small\r\nquantity of air diffuses continuously through the layer of carbonic acid\r\ngas on the surface, and supports the vitality of the cells.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that, in the working of breweries, there\r\nare several empirical practices the explanation of which is to be found\r\nwholly in the fact that the aeration of wort or beer exercises a great\r\ninfluence on fermentation. In many breweries we have seen the pitching\r\nperformed in the following manner: the brewer, having mixed his yeast in\r\nmany times its volume of wort, pours all the thick liquid from a height\r\nfrom one bucket into another, and from that back again into the first,\r\nand so on a great many times, until the two buckets are filled with the\r\nfroth enclosing air. In certain London breweries we have seen a bucket\r\nsuspended by a pulley over the fermenting tun, which is 3 or 4 metres\r\n(10 or 12 feet) in depth; this the brewer, by means of a cord, can lower\r\ninto the tun and pull up again at will, giving it a kind of see-saw\r\nmovement which agitates the surface of the liquid and aerates it. The\r\nuse of the fermenting tun itself and the racking of the wort from that\r\ntun into casks have the effect of aerating the beer and the yeast, and\r\nimparting to the latter a greater vigour and activity.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of fermentation in cask, after the beer has been run out\r\nof the tuns in “low” fermentation breweries is, in our opinion,\r\nprincipally due to the aeration of the beer at the moment when it is\r\nracked. The brewer ought to bear in mind that, during racking, every\r\ndetail is of importance; it makes a great difference whether when the\r\nbeer is run into the casks it falls from a height or is conducted by a\r\ntube to the bottom of the casks, whether it passes directly into the\r\ncasks, or is poured into them from buckets, and whether it runs in a\r\nstream of small or large diameter, since these different methods cause\r\nthe introduction of corresponding different quantities of air into the\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nWe have devised a simple arrangement for bringing the fermenting liquid\r\ninto contact with various proportions of atmospheric air. Appended is a\r\nsketch of this apparatus (Fig. 80). Instead of one tube serving alike\r\nfor the entrance and escape of gas, there are two similar ones, each of\r\nwhich opens into one of the tubulures on the cover. Round the other end\r\nof one of the tubes is fitted a kind of muff or bag, composed of a\r\ncylindrical cage of metallic gauze, over which a layer of well-combed\r\ncotton wool is placed, the whole being covered with a muslin bag. The\r\nobject of this arrangement is to act as an air-filter for retaining the\r\nparticles of dust. When fermentation has commenced in the apparatus, we\r\nhave simply to press momentarily the india-rubber connection between the\r\ntube from the lid and the tube with the bag. This will at once cause a\r\nregular stream of carbonic acid to issue from the end of the uncovered\r\ntube, whilst the air will enter by the filtering tube to take its place;\r\nand this arrangement will be maintained throughout the whole course of\r\nthe fermentation, even if we omit the precaution of increasing the power\r\nof the syphon by making the tube for the escape of this gas longer than\r\nthe other one.[167]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood how, whether by this last method, or by\r\nthe diameter of the tubes, we may vary the conditions of this\r\ncirculation of air in the apparatus, on the surface of the beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    § II.—Method of Estimating the Oxygen held in Solution in Wort.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of carbonic acid gas and the cooling of the wort, in contact\r\nwith that gas or in contact with very limited quantities of pure air,\r\nare by no means necessary to the application of the new process. There\r\nis only one thing that is absolutely essential—which is, the _purity_ of\r\nthe gases in the presence of which the wort is cooled and treated. If,\r\ntherefore, it is well to aerate our wort, either before or during\r\nfermentation, this may be done, on the sole condition that the air\r\nemployed does not introduce any germs of disease that are likely to\r\ndevelop in the beer during fermentation or afterwards. The question of\r\naerating the wort is not, however, so simple a matter as it seems at\r\nfirst sight. A very simple observation will show that wort cannot be\r\nsafely oxygenated by exposure, without precaution, to the air, even\r\nleaving out of account the germs of disease which that air may contain.\r\nIt is easy to show that finished wort has a decided flavour and aroma of\r\nhops, as well as a sweet taste, and that it leaves a certain pleasant,\r\nbitter after-taste on the palate. When we taste it in this condition we\r\ncannot help thinking that a liquor of the kind, after fermentation,\r\nought to constitute a very valuable beverage, as wholesome as it is\r\npleasant. Now all this pleasant and refreshing sensation that the wort\r\nleaves on the palate, which is due as much to the aroma as to the\r\nbitterness of the hop, disappears absolutely, we may say, if the wort is\r\nleft exposed to contact with air for a sufficient time, and that whether\r\nthe air be warm or cold. We may easily perform the experiment in one of\r\nour two-necked flasks, in which we can preserve the wort, in contact\r\nwith pure air, without any fear of change. The oxygen of the air enters\r\ninto combination with the substances that the hop introduces into the\r\nwort, and the wort, in consequence of this oxidation, gradually becomes\r\ntransformed into a saccharine decoction, without odour, in which even\r\nthe bitter flavour is destroyed or hidden. In other words, the wort\r\ngrows weak and flat, in just the same way that beer and wine do, as well\r\nas all the various natural or artificial worts which serve to produce\r\nthem. Thus it is evident that considerable care is necessary in\r\nsubjecting wort and beer, whether in course of manufacture or finished,\r\nto the action of atmospheric air. If, therefore, it is a good thing to\r\nsupply wort with oxygen, as we have already pointed out, in order to\r\nfacilitate the fermentation and nourish the yeast, it is, on the other\r\nhand, important that the quantity supplied to it should not be too\r\ngreat, otherwise we may injure the quality of the beer, and particularly\r\nits fulness on the palate, that is its apparent strength, which has very\r\nlittle to do with the proportion of alcohol in it. The strength of a\r\nbeer is intimately connected with those substances introduced by the\r\nhops into the wort and thus into the beer, to which we previously\r\nalluded, and of which too little is known; their properties and the\r\npalatableness resulting from them are very readily affected by the\r\noxygen of the air.[168]\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, to ascertain the measure in which air occurs during\r\nthe process of brewing, and whether, in the actual process, there may\r\nnot be too great a proportion of active oxygen present. The study of\r\nthis subject requires that we should know what quantities of oxygen may\r\nbe held in solution in the wort or absorbed by direct combination.\r\nFortunately this has been rendered a comparatively easy matter by a\r\nrapid method of estimating the oxygen held in solution in liquids of\r\nvarious kinds, devised by M. Schützenberger in 1872. As soon as this\r\nmethod was made known, we requested M. Raulin, who was attached to our\r\nlaboratory as assistant-director, to apply it to the determination of\r\noxygen in wort. This he did with his accustomed skill, devising certain\r\nalterations of details which rendered the method at the same time surer\r\nand more expeditious.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature in M. Schützenberger’s process consists in the\r\nemployment of a salt, the properties of which that chemist was the first\r\nto recognize; he has named it _hydrosulphite of soda_, and it is\r\nobtained by the action of zinc filings on a solution of bisulphite of\r\nsoda, out of contact with air.\r\n\r\nHydrosulphite of soda S^2O^2,NaO,HO, which is isomeric with hyposulphite\r\nof soda, only differs from the bisulphite by two equivalents of\r\noxygen.[169] When brought into contact with free oxygen, it absorbs that\r\ngas instantaneously and becomes converted into bisulphite; similarly\r\nwhen mixed with water, it immediately absorbs the oxygen held in\r\nsolution. Again there are colouring matters, such as M. Coupier’s\r\nsoluble aniline blue, that are instantaneously decolourized by\r\nhydrosulphite of soda, whilst they resist the action of the bisulphite.\r\nIf, taking care to avoid the access of air, we add hydrosulphite of soda\r\nto a certain volume of water—a litre, for example—that has been deprived\r\nof air and faintly coloured with Coupier’s blue, we shall see that a few\r\ndrops will be sufficient to effect the decoloration. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the water is aerated, the decoloration will not be effected\r\nbefore a sufficient quantity of the hydrosulphite has been added to\r\nabsorb the oxygen in solution, and the volume of the reagent required is\r\nin proportion to the quantity of oxygen in solution in the water. To\r\nrender the process sensitive, we must dilute the hydrosulphite to such\r\nan extent that 10 c.c., for example, may correspond very nearly with 1\r\nc.c. of oxygen. If the reagent would keep we should only have to\r\ndetermine directly, once for all, the volume of oxygen that a known\r\nvolume of the liquid could absorb; but, in consequence of its extreme\r\nliability to change through contact with air, it is necessary to titrate\r\nthe liquid every time before using it. This is easily done in the\r\nfollowing manner:—\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Messrs. Schützenberger and Lalande, the\r\nhydrosulphite decolourizes an ammoniacal solution of sulphate of copper,\r\nreducing the copper to a lower state of oxidation; the sulphite and\r\nbisulphite having no action as long as there is an excess of ammonia. We\r\nprepare a strongly ammoniacal solution of sulphate of copper, containing\r\nsuch a quantity of copper that 10 c.c. of the liquid will correspond, as\r\nfar as action on the hydrosulphite is concerned, with 1 c.c. of oxygen.\r\nCalculation by equivalents gives us the correct value verified by direct\r\nexperiment.[170]\r\n\r\nThe object of the modification which M. Raulin has introduced, is to\r\navoid the loss of time thus occasioned by the changes which take place\r\nin the titrated liquids by long keeping, as well as certain errors which\r\nmay arise from the acidity of the wort. On this latter point M.\r\nSchützenberger has remarked that the quantities of hydrosulphite of soda\r\ncorresponding with one and the same volume of oxygen vary with the\r\nacidity of the liquid operated upon, a phenomenon which that skilful\r\nchemist explains by the formation of oxygenated water, of varying\r\nstability in media of different acidity.\r\n\r\nInstead of determining the strength of the titrated solution of\r\nhydrosulphite before each operation, we take the solution as it happens\r\nto be, and determine its strength by causing it to act on a known volume\r\nof pure water saturated with oxygen at a certain temperature. The tables\r\nof solubility of oxygen in water give the exact volume of oxygen on\r\nwhich the measured volume of hydrosulphite used has acted. According to\r\nBunsen, about one minute’s brisk shaking in a closed bottle, with excess\r\nof air, will be sufficient to effect the maximum saturation of the water\r\nat the temperature at which we operate.\r\n\r\nFor experiments on wort we require:—\r\n\r\n1. A 2-litre (3-½ pints) flask, A, containing _saturated_ hydrosulphite\r\nof soda,[171] of such strength that 2·5 c.c. will be sufficient to\r\nabsorb almost all the oxygen in 50 c.c. of water saturated with air at\r\nthe ordinary temperature (that is, 1 volume of hyposulphite must equal\r\n20 volumes of water).\r\n\r\n2. A 2-litre flask, B, containing a solution of indigo-carmine, 50 c.c.\r\nof which will be decolourized by about 20 c.c. of the hydrosulphite.\r\nThis solution contains about 20 grammes (30·7 grains) of commercial\r\nindigo-carmine per litre (1·76 pints).\r\n\r\n3. An apparatus, C, for the production of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n4. An experimental apparatus composed of a burette, D, graduated in\r\ntenths of a cubic centimetre, and a three-necked Wollf’s bottle, E.\r\n\r\n5. A flask, F, holding about 100 c.c. provided with a straight tube\r\ndivided into tenths of a cubic centimetre, and containing a solution of\r\nammonia of such strength that about ten drops of it will neutralize the\r\nacidity in 50 c.c. (1·76 fl. oz.) of wort.\r\n\r\nTo perform the operation we shake about 150 c.c. (5·3 fl. oz.) of\r\ndistilled water, at the existing temperature, in a 1-litre flask for a\r\nminute or so; this saturates it with air, and we must at the same time\r\nnote the temperature. To be extremely precise, we should note also the\r\nbarometrical pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nInto the bottle E we introduce about 50 c.c. of the indigo solution, and\r\n200 c.c. of water at about 60° C. (140° F.), and fill the tube _e_ to\r\nthe point _b_ with water saturated with air; we then expel the air from\r\nthe bottle E by a current of hydrogen. The blue colour of the liquid in\r\nthe bottle is then very carefully brought to a yellow tint, by running\r\nin, drop by drop, the hydrosulphite with which the burette D is filled.\r\n\r\nWe next pour 50 c.c. of distilled water saturated with air into the\r\nfunnel _a_, and pass it into the flask; the blue colour reappears. We\r\nmust then bring back the colour to exactly the same tint of yellow. Let\r\n_n_ represent the number of divisions on the burette denoting the volume\r\nof hydrosulphite employed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe repeat this last operation immediately, taking 50 c.c. of the wort,\r\nthe oxygen of which we wish to determine, having first introduced into\r\nthe funnel _a_ a sufficient number of drops of the ammoniacal solution\r\nto neutralize the acidity of the wort. Let _n´_ represent the number of\r\ndivisions of hydrosulphite employed to restore the yellow tint in the\r\ncase of the wort.\r\n\r\nWe once more perform the experiment with 50 c.c. of saturated water; let\r\n_n´´_ be the number found.[172]\r\n\r\nThe ratio which the quantity of oxygen held in solution in the wort\r\nbears to the quantity of oxygen contained in the same volume of water\r\nsaturated with air, at the temperature _t_, and under the pressure H,\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Formula 3: _n´_/((_n_ + _n´´_)/2).]\r\n\r\nit will be sufficient in most cases to bear in mind this ratio.\r\n\r\nWhen we want to deduce the absolute quantity of oxygen held in solution\r\nin a volume V of the wort, we have merely to multiply this ratio by the\r\nquantity of oxygen contained in the same volume of water saturated with\r\nair, at the temperature _t_ and under the pressure H, a very simple\r\nproblem if we know the coefficients of the solubility of oxygen in water\r\nat different temperatures. These coefficients are given for ordinary\r\ntemperatures in the following table, which was compiled by Bunsen. We\r\nhave restricted the numbers to three places of decimals:—\r\n\r\n                  Temperatures.        Coefficients.\r\n                  0° C. (32° F.)       0·040\r\n                  1° C.

(68·0° F.)    0·028\r\n\r\nThe primary condition which enables us to rely on the exactness of this\r\nmethod is the fact which we have mentioned above, that a liquid if\r\nshaken up with air for one minute will become perfectly saturated with\r\noxygen. Substantially this is the case. In estimating the oxygen in\r\ndifferent parts of a liquid treated thus, we have invariably obtained\r\nthe same figures to within about 1/50th.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the variable quantity of the oxygen held in solution in\r\nthe liquid contained in the part of the tube _eb_, as well as the oxygen\r\nabsorbed during the treatment of the liquid in contact with air,\r\nconstitute causes of error. Experience, however, proves that these\r\ncauses of error are insignificant, as long as we have to deal with a\r\nliquid the aeration of which is not very far removed from the point of\r\nsaturation, and whose solubility-coefficient for oxygen is not widely\r\ndifferent from that of water for the same gas. Under such conditions we\r\nhave always found a constant ratio, to within about 1/40th between the\r\nsame liquid and air-saturated distilled water, placed under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we have to deal with a liquid which holds but a\r\nminute quantity of oxygen in solution, the causes of error mentioned may\r\nvery seriously affect our results, and it will be absolutely necessary\r\nto avoid them. The liquid experimented on must be treated out of contact\r\nwith air, by aspirating it directly from the vessel that contains it\r\ninto the pipette H, which is graduated for 50 c.c., and causing it to\r\npass thence into the flask E, by substituting the pipette for the funnel\r\n_a_. Finally, before arranging the pipette, we cause a small quantity of\r\nthe liquid in the flask, which has been previously brought to the exact\r\nyellow tint, to pass, by pressure, through the tube _eb_, so as to avoid\r\nthe cause of error that is likely to result from the air held in\r\nsolution in the liquid of that tube.\r\n\r\nThe liquid, the oxygen of which has to be determined, may also be passed\r\ndirectly from the vessel containing it into the flask E; the rest of the\r\noperation being performed as already described.\r\n\r\nIt was by this method that the oxygen held in saturate solution in wort\r\nwas determined. The following are the principal results obtained by M.\r\nRaulin:—\r\n\r\n1. At different pressures the ratio between the quantities of oxygen\r\nheld in solution in water and in wort is, all other conditions being\r\nsimilar, constant. This ratio has been found equal to 1·20 in the case\r\nof wort and water saturated with air at the ordinary pressure, and 1·24\r\nin the case of wort and water saturated with pure oxygen.\r\n\r\n2. The ratio between the coefficient of the solubility of oxygen in\r\nwater and that of its solubility in wort is very nearly constant at\r\ndifferent temperatures, increasing, however, slightly as the temperature\r\ndiminishes.\r\n\r\nThis ratio has been found to be—\r\n\r\n                   Temperatures.\r\n                   26° C.           (78·8° F.)   1·20\r\n                   19·5° C.         (67·1° F.)   1·25\r\n                   4° C.            (39·2° F.)   1·37\r\n\r\nAnother wort gave the following results:—\r\n\r\n                   Temperatures.\r\n                   9° C.            (48·2° F.)   1·15\r\n                   21° C.           (69·8° F.)   1·10\r\n                   25° C.           (77·0° F.)   1·07\r\n\r\n3. The ratio between the quantities of oxygen held in solution in water\r\nand those held in solution in wort increases with the concentration of\r\nthe wort. By evaporating the same wort to different degrees of\r\nconcentration, and afterwards saturating it with air, at the same\r\ntemperature, we obtained the following figures for the ratio in\r\nquestion:—\r\n\r\n                 Weak wort                      1·06\r\n                 The same evaporated to half    1·15\r\n                 “        ”      “  2/5         1·27\r\n                 ”        “      ”  3/10        1·45\r\n                 “        ”      “  1/6         1·96\r\n\r\n4. Worts of different origin, but of the same density and temperature,\r\nwhen saturated with oxygen, always contain very nearly the same quantity\r\nof that gas.\r\n\r\nTwo portions of the same wort, shaken up with air, one being hot the\r\nother cold, then left to themselves for some time, and afterwards\r\nsaturated with air, at the same temperature, gave the figures 1·22 for\r\nthe ratio between the oxygen in the water and that in the wort.\r\n\r\nDifferent worts of the same density, saturated at a temperature of 15°\r\nC. (59° F.), gave the following ratios:—\r\n\r\n             Wort kept in a bottle with air for 19    1·140\r\n             months\r\n\r\n             Wort recently prepared                   1·142\r\n\r\n             Wort kept in a bottle without air for 20 1·142\r\n             months, aerated for 18 days\r\n\r\n             Wort evaporated to dryness and made up   1·126\r\n             with water\r\n\r\n5. The solubility of oxygen in wort differs very little from the\r\nsolubility of oxygen in sweetened water of the same density.\r\n\r\nAn experiment was made with a solution of sugar on the one hand, and\r\nwith wort more or less diluted with water on the other hand, at the same\r\ntemperature of 11° C. (51·8° F.). The following figures were obtained\r\nfor the ratios of solubility:—\r\n\r\n                                         Solution   Wort.\r\n                                         of Sugar.\r\n\r\n               Marking 17·9°             1·278      1·27\r\n               Balling[173]\r\n\r\n               “    14·0°    ”           1·190      1·15\r\n\r\n               “     7·0°    ”           1·092      1·06\r\n\r\n6. From the preceding results it is easy to deduce a general formula\r\nwhich shall give the coefficient of solubility of oxygen in any wort,\r\nmarking B° by _Balling_, and at temperature _t_°.\r\n\r\nFrom the figures of (2) it follows that above and below the temperature\r\nof 15° C. (59° F.), the ratio which the coefficient of solubility of\r\noxygen in water bears to that of the solubility of the same gas in wort\r\nvaries about 0·006 for each degree of the thermometer. From the figures\r\nof (3) it follows that the same ratio varies about 0·002 for each degree\r\nof _Balling_ above and below the 15th degree on the instrument.\r\n\r\nBy taking _c_ for the coefficient of solubility of oxygen in water at\r\n_t_° C., and _c´_ for that of oxygen in wort also at _t_° C., and having\r\na density B, by _Balling_ at 15° C.; and taking X for the ratio\r\n_c_/_c´_, at 15° C. and 15° _Balling_, we shall have\r\n\r\n    _c_/_c´_ = X + (B - 15) 0·022 - (_t_ - 15) 0·006.\r\n\r\nBy carefully ascertaining the ratio _c_/_c´_ for different worts, and\r\nadopting the preceding formula, we have found for X a mean value of\r\n1·16.\r\n\r\nThe definitive formula, therefore, is:\r\n\r\n    (1) _c_/_c´_ = 1·16 + (B-15) 0·022 - (_t_ - 15) 0·006,\r\n\r\nor again,\r\n\r\n    (2) _c_/_c´_ = 0·86 - (B - 15) 0·016 + (_t_ - 15) 0·004.\r\n\r\nThe coefficient _c_ of the solubility of oxygen in water will be found\r\nin the table given a few pages back.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § III.—On the Quantity of Oxygen existing in a state of Solution in\r\n                          Brewers’ Worts.[174]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wort, when it comes from the copper in which it is boiled with the\r\nhops, remains exposed upon the coolers for a time, the length of which\r\nvaries according to circumstances, the most important of which is the\r\nexterior temperature. The average time is from seven to eight hours,\r\nduring which the volume of the wort diminishes, whilst its density\r\nincreases; at the same time, it deposits its proteinaceous matters and\r\nabsorbs oxygen from the air, either by way of solution or of\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nIn the present paragraph we shall confine ourselves to the uncombined\r\noxygen held in a state of solution in wort, recognizable by the change\r\nof colour produced by its action on white indigo.\r\n\r\nThe use of the coolers enables the brewer to obtain his wort in two\r\ndistinct states of limpidity—filtered wort and unfiltered wort. At the\r\nsame time there is a further difference between these worts, namely, in\r\nthe quantity of oxygen held in solution. The unfiltered wort comes\r\ndirect from the coolers; the wort to be filtered, mixed with a part of\r\nthe deposit, is run into a special vessel, from which it is distributed\r\nover the filtering surfaces, which are generally of felt; filtered\r\nbright, it is then received in a reservoir, from which it is distributed\r\namongst special fermenting vessels. Falling through the air in a thin\r\nstream of drops, it must necessarily have become charged with a greater\r\nquantity of oxygen than ordinary wort. In good breweries it is put apart\r\nby itself to ferment, and the yeast which it yields is firmer and\r\ndeposits more easily than that of unfiltered wort. As for the\r\nfermentation, it is, under similar conditions, quicker by a day or a day\r\nand a half than in the case of ordinary wort. The difference in the\r\nquantity of oxygen held in solution in the two kinds of wort is greater\r\nin proportion as the external temperature is lower; in winter it may be\r\ntwice as great as in summer. The reason is that in summer a boiling wort\r\ndoes not obtain a minimum temperature of 20° C. (68° F.), on the best\r\ncoolers, in less than six or seven hours. After leaving the coolers it\r\nis passed over a refrigerator. In winter it attains that temperature in\r\nabout three hours, or less, which then goes on sinking on the coolers.\r\nDuring the last two or three hours which are employed in bringing the\r\ntemperature still lower, as also during the running off, the wort\r\nabsorbs an appreciable quantity of oxygen. In other words, wort in\r\nwinter remains for a longer time at low temperatures, in free contact\r\nwith air.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance unites with this exposure upon the coolers to\r\nincrease the aeration of the wort; the wort is run into the fermenting\r\ntuns through pipes of large sectional area, more or less bent, and\r\ncarries with it by suction considerable quantities of air, which, from\r\nthe continual agitation, gets well mixed with it. The effect of this\r\nmixing in the pipes is to considerably increase the proportion of air in\r\nsolution in the wort, especially in winter, when the temperature of the\r\nwort is lower; and from the figures given below we may, although it is\r\nvery variable, put the average increase at a quarter of the whole\r\namount. The calculation has been made by comparing the quantities of air\r\nheld in solution in two samples of the same wort, one of which was taken\r\nfrom the coolers at the moment of “turning out,”[175] and the other from\r\nthe fermenting vessel after it was filled.\r\n\r\nLet us call the ratio between the quantity of oxygen held in solution by\r\na wort, and that which the same wort would hold in solution if saturated\r\nat the same temperature, the _degree of saturation_ of that wort at the\r\ntemperature _t_.\r\n\r\nThe determination of degrees of saturation is reduced to a comparison of\r\nthe number of divisions of hydrosulphite _n_ which satisfies the wort in\r\nthe first case, with the number _n´_ corresponding with the same wort\r\nsaturated at the same temperature. The ratio _n_/_n´_ gives the degree\r\nof saturation at the temperature _t_.\r\n\r\nIn experiments made with a wort at 14·5° _Balling_ as mean density, we\r\nfound the following results:—\r\n\r\nIn summer, in the case of worts reduced to the temperature of 5° C. (41°\r\nF.) by a refrigerator, the degrees of saturation may be set down as—\r\n\r\n                       For unfiltered worts 0·500\r\n                       For filtered worts   0·800\r\n\r\nIn winter, in the case of some worts which were racked at a temperature\r\nof from 3° to 4° C. (37·4° to 39·2° F.), without the use of a\r\nrefrigerator, we found the saturation complete in both worts. In the\r\ncase of a very low external temperature, however (-10° C., 14° F.), we\r\nhave failed to determine the saturation in an unfiltered wort. As\r\nregards the mean winter figures, in the case of worts racked at a\r\ntemperature of 5° C. (41° F.), they may be fixed at these:—\r\n\r\n                       For unfiltered wort  0·850\r\n                       For filtered wort    0·950\r\n\r\nIn autumn and spring we find the mean figures to be intermediate between\r\nthose given above:—\r\n\r\n                  For unfiltered wort  0·500 to 0·850\r\n                  For filtered wort    0·800 to 0·950\r\n\r\nFrom these ratios it is easy to find the quantity of oxygen contained in\r\nbrewers’ worts, if we also refer to Bunsen’s Tables and the formula (2)\r\ngiven in the preceding section. At the temperature of 5° C. (41° F.), at\r\nwhich the above worts were “gathered,”[176] and not taking into account\r\nthe very small correction that should be made for the difference of half\r\na degree on Balling, we find, by this formula, as the ratio of the\r\ncoefficients of the solubility of oxygen in saturated wort and in water—\r\n\r\n    _c´_/_c_ = 0·82\r\n\r\nNow, at the temperature of 5° C., the quantity of oxygen held in\r\nsolution in 1 litre of water is, according to Bunsen, 0·036 litre, at\r\nthe atmospheric pressure, and therefore at the pressure of 1/5th\r\natmosphere, which is that of the oxygen in atmospheric air, it will be—\r\n\r\n    0·036/5 litre = 7·2 c.c.—[that is, 2 cubic inches per gallon.]\r\n\r\nAnd, consequently, in the case of saturated wort, it will be—\r\n\r\n    7·2 c.c. × 0·82 = 5·904 c.c.—[that is, 1·62 cub. inches per gall.]\r\n\r\nMultiplying this last number of c.c. by the different _degrees of\r\nsaturation_ found, we shall obtain the volumes of oxygen held in\r\nsolution in 1 litre of different worts:—\r\n\r\n          Summer worts {Unfiltered 0·500 × 5·904 c.c. = 2·952 c.c.\r\n                       {Filtered   0·800 × 5·904  “   = 4·723  ”\r\n\r\n          Winter worts {Unfiltered 0·850 × 5·904  “   = 5·018  ”\r\n                       {Filtered   0·950 × 5·904  “   = 5·609  ”\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that we are here dealing with wort taken from\r\nthe fermenting vessel just before it was pitched; that is to say, when\r\nthe quantity of oxygen held in solution was as large as the treatment to\r\nwhich it had been subjected allowed of its being. The mode of taking it\r\nfor examination is as follows:—A burette, H (Fig. 81), is plunged into\r\nthe fermenting vessel, the temperature of which at the time is\r\nascertained very exactly, the upper part of the burette being fitted\r\nwith an india-rubber tube, _a b_, longer than itself. The liquid is then\r\nsucked up the tube, and soon completely fills the apparatus and runs out\r\nat _b_ (Fig. 82). By lowering the tube the whole arrangement thus forms\r\na syphon, and enables us to let the wort that we are experimenting on\r\nflow for some minutes; when every trace of air has been thus expelled,\r\nthe lower tap is closed and the liquid is introduced into\r\nSchützenberger’s apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nAs for the saturated wort, the value of which in oxygen serves to\r\ndetermine one of the elements of the degree of saturation, it is readily\r\nobtained by introducing a volume of from 100 c.c. to 150 c.c. of wort\r\ninto a 2-litre or 3-litre flask, and shaking it briskly so as to\r\nsaturate it with air; it is then poured into a settling-glass, to\r\nseparate it from the great quantity of froth formed in the shaking, and\r\nthen, by means of a graduated pipette, 50 c.c. is taken for examination.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the influence that oxygen has on the activity of\r\nyeast, on its development and, consequently, on the progress of\r\nfermentation. Moreover, we know, from experiments already mentioned,\r\nwhich we communicated to the Academy and the Chemical Society in 1861,\r\nthat the rapid development of yeast in contact with air is in reciprocal\r\nrelation to the disappearance of the oxygen from the air. Knowing the\r\nconditions of the aeration of wort from the moment when it arrives on\r\nthe coolers until the moment when, in the fermenting tun, it is about to\r\nbe pitched, it would be interesting to ascertain what happens to the\r\noxygen dissolved in the wort at the moment of pitching, how yeast is\r\naffected when suddenly brought into contact with that oxygen; what part,\r\nin short, that gas plays in fermentation.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore follow up, hour by hour, the degree of saturation after\r\npitching, in Tourtel’s brewery. On November 4th, 1875, some wort at 14°\r\nBalling was pumped on to the coolers at 7 p.m., and at 4 a.m. went down\r\nto a 32-hectolitre (700 gallons) tun, its temperature then being 6° C.\r\n(42·8° F.) The pitching, in which about 100 grammes (3·2 oz. troy) of\r\npressed yeast was used per hectolitre (22 gallons), took place at 5 a.m.\r\nThe following is the curve of the degrees of saturation of the oxygen,\r\nas drawn by Messrs. Calmettes and Grenet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe abscissæ represent the time expressed in hours, and the ordinates\r\ngive the degrees of saturation of the wort with oxygen. It will be seen\r\nthat about twelve hours after the pitching, and at a temperature of 6°\r\nC., all the oxygen had disappeared, absorbed by the yeast. We shall find\r\nthat wort by itself, unassociated with yeast, would also have combined\r\nwith oxygen; but in the course of twelve hours, at 6° C., this\r\ncombination would have been scarcely appreciable in absence of yeast. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that the oxygen in solution is taken up by the\r\nyeast, under the conditions of which we are speaking. This has been\r\nproved directly by an experiment. A double quantity of yeast was\r\nemployed for a tun similar to the preceding one, and it was found that\r\nthe oxygen in solution disappeared completely in less than half the time\r\nthat it took to disappear in the first case.[177] It is very important\r\nto notice that in our 32-hectolitre tun, at the moment when we\r\ndetermined the complete disappearance of the oxygen in solution, the\r\ncells of yeast had assumed a younger and fuller appearance than they had\r\nat first; but they had not multiplied at all up to that time, nor were\r\nthere even any buds then visible on them. The oxygen, therefore, must be\r\nstored up somehow in the cells, taken up by their oxidizable matters to\r\nbe brought into work subsequently, or to act as a _primum movens_ of\r\nlife and nutrition, spreading its influence over several successive\r\ngenerations of cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n             § IV.—On the Combination of Oxygen with Wort.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric oxygen is not merely taken into solution by wort; it\r\nalso combines with it, as a very simple experiment will suffice to show.\r\nIf we place in a tinned iron vessel some boiling wort, separated from\r\nthe hops in the copper, and cool it suddenly by plunging it into iced\r\nwater, and after having cooled it down in this manner to 15° or 20° C.\r\n(59° or 68° F.), saturate it with oxygen, by shaking it briskly in a\r\nlarge flask, and then completely fill a vessel with it and close it up\r\nfor twelve hours, we shall find at the end of that time, if we test it\r\nwith the hydrosulphite of soda, as we have described in § II., that it\r\ndoes not contain a trace of free oxygen. The whole of the gas which was\r\noriginally held in solution will have entered into combination, that is\r\nto say, the liquid, first coloured blue with the indigo-carmine, and\r\nthen brought to a yellow tint by means of the hydrosulphite of soda,\r\nwill not regain its original blue colour through the action of this\r\nwort. The following experiments were undertaken with the object of\r\nstudying this property of wort, and in order that we might form some\r\nidea of its importance, and of the total quantity of oxygen that wort\r\ncan absorb under certain special circumstances. The experiments were\r\nperformed in our own laboratory on wort from Tourtel’s brewery, which M.\r\nCalmettes had forwarded to us in bottles prepared in the brewery at\r\nTantonville, in the following manner: Each bottle was filled with\r\nboiling wort taken from the copper and closed with a bored cork, through\r\nwhich the neck of a funnel passed; the funnel also was filled with the\r\nwort, and the whole preserved from contact with air by a layer of oil.\r\nThe next day the bottles were corked full by the help of a bottling\r\nneedle,[178] previously heated, with perfect corks that had been passed\r\nthrough the flame. The bottles arrived in Paris in very good condition,\r\nquite full of the liquid up to the corks. They were left undisturbed for\r\none or two days at the same temperature as that to which they had been\r\nexposed during the corking and the journey. The object of this was to\r\nafford time for a deposit of the wort to form at the bottom of each\r\nbottle. As a matter of fact, we know that wort boiling in the copper is\r\ncharged with proteinaceous matters and other floating and insoluble\r\nsubstances. The wort above the deposit was turbid and opaline; it was in\r\nthis state when we used it for our experiments. It may be taken for\r\ngranted, without risk of appreciable error, that the wort had been\r\nabsolutely deprived of oxygen in solution, inasmuch as it had been\r\nbottled when boiling, and had cooled down out of contact with air. As\r\nfor the quantity of oxygen that it might have held in combination, this\r\nmust have been insignificant, although there must have been some, since\r\nthe wort had been exposed to the air in the copper; the oxygen in\r\ncombination, however, could have had no appreciable influence on the\r\nresults which we obtained. Let us call this wort _boiled wort_.\r\n\r\n_First Experiment._—Into a straight-necked flask we introduced a certain\r\nmeasured quantity of this wort by means of a syphon, taking care that\r\nthe syphon should only act on the opaque wort, and should not reach the\r\ndeposit at the bottom of the bottle. We then drew out the neck to a fine\r\ntube in the flame and boiled the wort; and during ebullition we sealed\r\nthe end of the fine tube. After it had cooled, we arranged that pure air\r\nshould enter the flask. To do this we made a file mark near the fine\r\nclosed point of the flask, and connected the point by a piece of\r\nindia-rubber tubing with a glass tube containing a column of asbestos,\r\nwhich we heated. We then broke off the point of the flask inside the\r\nindia-rubber tube, so that the air entered the flask after being\r\nfiltered through the asbestos. We removed the india-rubber tube and\r\nsealed up once more the fine end of the neck at the point where we had\r\nbroken it off. Finally, to aerate the wort to saturation, we shook the\r\nflask briskly for some minutes, and then placed it in a hot-water bath,\r\nwhere we left it for about a quarter of an hour. We afterwards removed\r\nit to an oven at 25° (77° F.). We repeated the same operation next day\r\nand the four succeeding days.\r\n\r\nThe wort, which at first was scarcely coloured, gradually assumed a\r\nreddish-brown tint, and deposited an amorphous matter, but without\r\nbrightening. It became clear, however, when filtered, which was not the\r\ncase with the turbid, opaline wort in the bottles when they arrived.\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of the air in the flask, made immediately\r\nafter a renewed and vigorous shaking, the object of which was to\r\nsaturate the wort with air before analyzing the supernatant air:—\r\n\r\n    November 29th.\r\n\r\n          Temperature at which the flask was refilled with air 4° C.\r\n        (29·2° F.)\r\n\r\n          Atmospheric pressure 751 mm. (29·6 ins.)\r\n\r\n                  Total volume of flask 333 c.c. (20·32 cub. in.)\r\n\r\n                  Volume occupied by the wort 120 “ ( 7·32 ” )\r\n\r\n    December 8th.\r\n\r\n          Volume of gas analyzed 27·6 c.c. (1·68 cub. ins.)\r\n\r\n                  After treatment with potash 27·4 c.c. (1·67 “ )\r\n\r\n                    ” “ pyrogallol 22·4 ” (1·36 “ )\r\n\r\n                     Oxygen 5·0 c.c. (0·305 cub. in.)\r\n\r\n    Composition of the gas:— Per cent.\r\n\r\n        Oxygen 18·25\r\n\r\n        Nitrogen 81·57\r\n\r\nThe formula which we deduced above (§ II.) allows us to conclude that at\r\nthe temperature of 8° C. (46·4° F.), which was the temperature at which\r\nthe wort was saturated before the analysis given above, the quantity of\r\noxygen in solution in the 120 c.c. (4·2 fl. oz.) of wort was 0·84 c.c.\r\n(0·051 cub. in.).\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the flask was closed, the total volume of oxygen,\r\ncalculated to zero and 760 mm. (30 in.) pressure, was 44·73 c.c. (2·729\r\ncub. in.).\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the analysis was finished, the volume of oxygen was\r\ncalculated to the same conditions of temperature and pressure, 38·86\r\nc.c. (2·355 cub. in.); 5·87 c.c. (0·374 cub. in.) has, therefore,\r\ndisappeared. Now, as there is 0·84 c.c. (0·051 cub. in.) in solution,\r\nthere has, consequently, been an absorption, by combination with 120\r\nc.c. of wort, of 5·03 c.c. (0·32 cub. in.) of oxygen, or 41·7 c.c. per\r\nlitre (11·6 cub. ins. per gallon).\r\n\r\n_Second Experiment._—In a similar experiment, in which, however, the\r\nflask was kept for five days at a rigorously constant temperature of 55°\r\nC. (131° F.), day and night, and in which the supernatant air was not\r\nshaken up with the wort, we found—\r\n\r\n    Volume of gas analyzed 28·5\r\n\r\n        After treatment with potash 28·3\r\n\r\n          “ ” “ pyrogallol 23·0\r\n\r\n           Oxygen 5·3\r\n\r\n    Composition of the gas:— Per cent.\r\n\r\n        Oxygen 18·6\r\n\r\n        Nitrogen 81·4\r\n\r\n    Total oxygen at first 29·40\r\n\r\n      “ ” remaining 26·04\r\n\r\n      “ ” that has disappeared 3·36\r\n\r\n      “ ” in solution 0·54\r\n\r\n      “ ” in combination 2·82\r\n\r\n      Or per litre, 35·2 c.c. (9·8 cub. ins. per gallon).\r\n\r\nThe colour of the wort in this experiment had become sensibly similar to\r\nthat of the wort in the preceding experiment.\r\n\r\n_Third Experiment._—In another experiment we left the flask, for the\r\nsame length of time again, after it had been refilled with air and\r\nreclosed, at a temperature which varied between 2° and 4°C. (35·6° and\r\n39·2° F.). In this case we found—\r\n\r\n    Volume of air analyzed 27·8\r\n\r\n    After the action of potash 27·8\r\n\r\n    After pyrogallic acid 22·3\r\n\r\n         Oxygen 5·5\r\n\r\n\r\n    Composition of the gas:— Per cent.\r\n\r\n          Oxygen 19·7\r\n\r\n          Nitrogen 80·3\r\n\r\n          Total oxygen at first 29·40 c.c.\r\n\r\n            “ ” remaining 27·58\r\n\r\n            “ ” that has disappeared 1·82\r\n\r\n            “ ” in solution 0·44\r\n\r\n            “ ” in combination 1·38\r\n\r\n            Or per litre, 17·20 c.c. (4·8 cub. ins. per gallon).\r\n\r\nIn this last experiment the wort was scarcely darker in colour. Its\r\ncolour, compared with that of wort cooled on the coolers in the brewery,\r\nwas slightly darker; but the difference, although it existed, was\r\nscarcely appreciable. We shall revert to this fact, which is of\r\nimportance, presently.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Experiment._—The following series of experiments were undertaken\r\nto enable us to form some idea of the rapidity with which oxygen is\r\nabsorbed by wort.\r\n\r\nWe employed three flasks. A, B, C, of the following capacities:—\r\n\r\n    A = 234\r\n\r\n    B = 214\r\n\r\n    C = 203\r\n\r\ninto which we introduced the following quantities of wort (boiled wort,\r\nwithout air):—\r\n\r\n    Into A 96 c.c.\r\n\r\n     “ B 84 ”\r\n\r\n     “ C 84 ”\r\n\r\nThe necks of the flasks were then drawn out and sealed in a flame, the\r\nliquid being at a temperature of 5° C. (41° F.). The flasks were then\r\nplaced in a hot-water bath and kept at 100° C. (212° F.) for a quarter\r\nof an hour. The flask A was repeatedly shaken during cooling, as also\r\nwas the flask B, this being omitted in the case of the flask C.\r\n\r\nThe contents of flask A were submitted to analysis as soon as it was\r\nquite cooled—that is to say, in about three hours. The analysis of\r\ncontents of B and C was delayed for about twenty-four hours. We took the\r\nprecaution of not commencing the analysis before we had shaken the\r\nflasks for a few minutes, so that the wort in all of them might be\r\nsaturated at a fixed temperature, and thus enable us to ascertain the\r\nexact quantity of oxygen in solution.\r\n\r\nThe analyses showed that the worts in the three flasks contained:—\r\n\r\n    Flask A, oxygen in combination, per litre 20 c.c.\r\n\r\n      “ B, ” “ ” 21·4 c.c.\r\n\r\n      “ C, ” “ ” 16·8 c.c.\r\n\r\nSeveral facts may be deduced from these experiments: the shaking up of\r\nthe wort with air has a marked effect on the absorption; a very\r\nappreciable absorption immediately follows the shaking up of the wort\r\nwhen warm; whereas, in the case of cold wort that has remained\r\nundisturbed, the absorption takes place slowly.\r\n\r\nThe results of the preceding experiments plainly show that the wort,\r\nwhich is very hot when it comes on to the coolers, where it remains for\r\nseveral hours, must absorb an appreciable quantity of oxygen by\r\ncombination; but these same experiments teach us nothing definite\r\nconcerning the volume of oxygen that is actually absorbed. We can only\r\ngather from the remark which concludes the third experiment given above,\r\nthat the total quantity of oxygen absorbed by the wort in Tourtel’s\r\nbrewery, during the time that it remains on the coolers, must be less\r\nthan 17 c.c. per litre (4·7 cubic inches per gallon), inasmuch as the\r\ncoloration effected by combined oxygen in the proportion of 17 c.c. per\r\nlitre was considerably greater than that of the wort taken from the\r\nbacks in the brewery.\r\n\r\nIf we knew the curve of cooling on the Tourtonville coolers we might\r\neasily, in experiments conducted in our laboratory, assimilate the\r\nconditions of our experiments to those of the oxidation of the wort in\r\nthe brewery, by exposing wort in contact with air in closed flasks to\r\ntemperatures varying according to the indications of the curve in\r\nquestion. For this purpose, we induced M. Calmettes to study the process\r\nof cooling upon the coolers at Tantonville. In Fig. 84 the figures found\r\nin one of that gentleman’s experiments are given.\r\n\r\nThe abscissæ represent the time expressed in hours; the ordinates, the\r\ndegrees of temperature. The exterior temperature was 0° C. (32° F.); the\r\natmosphere was calm. The wort was pumped on to the coolers at 5.20 p.m.,\r\nits temperature then being 85° C. (185° F.), and the operation of\r\npumping lasted from 5.20 to 5.30 p.m. The first determination was made\r\nat 5.30 p.m., and was repeated every ten minutes until 7.30 p.m. Between\r\n7.30 and 8.30 p.m. it was repeated every twenty minutes; after that, it\r\nwas repeated every half-hour until 2 a.m., when the wort went down to\r\nthe fermenting vessels. The mean depth of the wort was 8·5 centimetres\r\n(3·1 inches).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Curve of cooling of the wort on the coolers\r\n(December 18th, 1875).]\r\n\r\nHaving determined the rate of cooling in the brewery, we made the\r\nfollowing experiment: a known quantity of wort from the copper—deprived,\r\nconsequently, of oxygen—in the same condition as when it comes on the\r\ncoolers, was put into a graduated, cylindrical vessel, which was then\r\nclosed with an india-rubber cork, and placed immediately, without being\r\nshaken, in a hot water bath at 85° C. (185° F.). Another vessel similar\r\nto the preceding one, and having a thermometer passed through the cork,\r\nand immersed in the wort, enabled us to observe the temperature. The\r\ntemperature was gradually reduced, in exact accordance with the data of\r\nthe preceding curve, until the water, in the course of eight hours and a\r\nhalf, was brought down to 10° C. (50° F.). It is true, that we cannot\r\npretend to have realized all the conditions of the coolers, in this\r\nmanner, but we approached them very nearly; moreover, it was an\r\napproximation rather than a rigorous determination that we desired to\r\nobtain. We then collected over mercury the air which remained in the\r\nflask, and analyzed it very carefully; at the same time, with\r\nSchützenberger’s apparatus, we determined the oxygen held in solution in\r\nthe wort so treated. From the results thus obtained we easily found the\r\nquantity of oxygen that had disappeared—that is, the oxygen which the\r\nwort had acquired from the atmosphere of the flask, and which had\r\ncombined with the oxidizable matters of the wort.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the flask being 815 c.c., that of the wort 391 c.c., and\r\nthe depth of the liquid 8 cm., we found an absorption by combination of\r\n9·49 c.c. of oxygen per litre of wort (2·63 cub. ins. per gallon).\r\nAnother flask treated in the same manner gave us similar results.\r\n\r\nAs the oxygen in solution has so great an influence on fermentation, it\r\nis important that we should, likewise, know the effect produced by the\r\noxygen in combination. The following considerations and experiments may\r\nthrow some light on this subject:—\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that natural saccharine worts oxidize, and\r\nacquire colour in contact with air, and that this coloration disappears\r\nwhen these worts are caused to ferment. This furnishes one presumption,\r\nthat the oxygen in combination disappears then, from, being abstracted\r\nby the ferment. A similar phenomenon is observable in the case of wort.\r\nAfter having acquired a marked dark shade by remaining in contact with\r\npure air, it loses this colour very appreciably during fermentation; and\r\nif the wort does not quite regain the colour which it originally had\r\nwhen it came from the copper, this circumstance is probably owing to the\r\nfact that the quantity of oxygen in combination with the wort is larger\r\nthan that which is abstracted by the yeast. We have seen that yeast\r\nabsorbs oxygen, since, in the case of a saccharine wort, more or less\r\nsaturated with oxygen in solution, when fermentation commences, the\r\nfirst effect of the ferment is to cause that oxygen to combine with its\r\nown substance. We should, therefore, expect to find the oxygen in\r\ncombination, as well as that held in solution, in wort, abstracted by\r\nthe yeast and contributing to the activity of fermentation. As a matter\r\nof fact, this is proved by direct experiments, for the fermentation of a\r\nwort that has oxidized in contact with air, or of one from which all the\r\noxygen that was held in solution in it has disappeared by direct\r\ncombination, is much more easy, rapid, and complete than the\r\nfermentation of the same wort when it contains no oxygen, whether free\r\nor combined. These experiments were as follows: we boiled some _copper\r\nwort_ in a large double-necked flask, like those shown in Fig. 73; all\r\nthe air being expelled, pure air was allowed to enter the flask; and\r\nwhen the wort was cool it was saturated with this air, by being shaken\r\nbriskly for a quarter of an hour. The wort was then forced by a pressure\r\nof air, applied to the extremity of the S-shaped tube, into smaller\r\nflasks, similar to the preceding ones; these we filled completely, and\r\nthen plunged the end of their sinuous tubes under mercury. After waiting\r\nfor two or three days, a longer time than was required for the oxygen in\r\nsolution to enter into combination—a fact which we confirmed by means of\r\na similar flask, which served as a standard—we caused the wort, so\r\nprepared, to ferment in the flasks, and side by side, for the sake of\r\ncomparison, some _copper wort_ that contained no air in solution or\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nIn other experiments we operated on pure wort, saturated with oxygen in\r\ncombination, by being allowed to remain for one year in an open flask in\r\ncontact with pure air. This wort was deprived of air in solution by a\r\nprotracted boiling over mercury. It was then pitched, out of contact of\r\nair, with an old yeast. The yeast underwent no development at all, a\r\nproof that oxygen in combination cannot act like oxygen that is free, or\r\nsimply in solution, in effecting the revival of the yeast; nevertheless,\r\nafter the revival has been once started by means of a small quantity of\r\nair, fermentation declares itself with much greater facility than in the\r\ncase of copper wort, placed under the same conditions, but deprived of\r\noxygen in combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n § V. On the Influence of Oxygen in Combination on the Clarification of\r\n                                 Wort.\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen in combination has another effect which it is essentially\r\nimportant to point out, for it concerns the clarification of beer. One\r\nof the most valued properties of this beverage is its limpidity and\r\nbrilliancy. We know from the results of the fourth experiment in the\r\npreceding paragraph that in the case of a wort shaken up when hot with\r\nair, and examined as soon as cold, that is, after an interval of only\r\nthree hours, we find a notable volume of oxygen to have been absorbed by\r\ncombination; in the experiment to which we allude, this volume was not\r\nless than 20 c.c. of oxygen per litre of wort. The shaking up of the\r\nwort when cold with air saturated it with oxygen in solution, but the\r\nquantity of oxygen which under these conditions entered into\r\ncombination, in the course of three hours, is insignificant, although\r\nsaturation by solution may be attained in the course of one minute’s\r\nshaking. If two samples of the same wort are shaken up with air, one of\r\nthem being hot and the other cold, and both filtered after having been\r\nleft undisturbed for twenty-four hours, or even immediately after the\r\nagitation, we cannot fail to be struck with the great difference that\r\nthey will present in point of brightness. The wort that was shaken up\r\nhot will have more colour, and will be brilliant; the other will be\r\nturbid, and will not become clear for five or six days, when left to\r\nitself in contact with air and filtered again. This explains a fact that\r\nmay be easily verified in practice: Boiled wort, if cooled down\r\nsuddenly, or slowly but out of contact with air, or shaken up cold in\r\ncontact with air, is opaque when filtered; whilst the same wort, cooled\r\ndown on the coolers where it has taken a certain quantity of oxygen into\r\ncombination, generally passes through the filter very bright. The\r\nintelligent brewer is uneasy when this is not the case, for it cannot be\r\ndenied that the easy clarification of wort has a favourable influence on\r\nthe easy clarification of beer.\r\n\r\nIt would, nevertheless, be a grave error to suppose that the\r\nclarification of beer must necessarily follow that of wort, and we may\r\nbe permitted to make a digression here on the subject, to prove this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nOn February 3rd, 1874, we brewed 2 hectolitres (44 gallons) of beer. The\r\nboiling wort, hops and all, was run into a vessel like that represented\r\nin Fig. 80, but provided in addition with a false bottom, pierced with\r\nholes and fixed at 1 centimetre (0·39 inch) above the true bottom of the\r\nvessel; this was meant to retain the spent hops. The temperature of the\r\nwort in the vessel after it was filled, February 3rd, 4 p.m., was 90° C.\r\n(194° F.), that of the room was 10° C. (50° F.). We permitted the wort\r\nto cool down gently, without running cold water over the vessel. The\r\nwort indicated a density of 14° Balling.\r\n\r\nThe following temperatures were taken:—\r\n\r\n                       Temp. of               Temp. of\r\n                       Wort.                  Room.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 4,    11 a.m. 38°   C.   (100·4° F.) 9° C.      (48·2° F.)\r\n\r\n                7 p.m. 30°   C.   ( 86°   F.) 9° C.      (48·2° F.)\r\n\r\n            11.30 p.m. 26·3° C.   ( 79·3° F.) 9° C.      (48·2° F.)\r\n\r\n    Feb. 5,     9 a.m. 21°    C.  ( 69·8° F.) 8°   C.    (46·4° F.)\r\n\r\n               12 a.m. 19·75° C.  ( 66·6° F.) 8°   C.    (46·4° F.)\r\n\r\n                4 p.m. 18°    C.  ( 64·4° F.) 8·5° C.    (47·3° F.)\r\n\r\n    Feb. 6,    11 a.m. 14°    C.  ( 57·2° F.) 8°   C.    (46·4° F.)\r\n\r\n    Feb. 7,     2 p.m. 11°    C.  ( 51·8° F.) 7°   C.    (44·6° F.)\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time the wort drawn from the smaller tap half-way up\r\nthe vessel had already become very bright, although it was taken from\r\nthe bulk of the liquid above the deposit of hops.\r\n\r\nOn February 8th the temperature of the wort was 9·5° C. (49·1° F.), and\r\nthat of the room 5° C. (41° F.); the wort was again very bright. Taken\r\nfrom the small tap and tested by Schützenberger’s process it gave no\r\nevidence of free oxygen in solution, although its surface was in contact\r\nwith air. It continued absolutely pure, the arrangements of our vessel,\r\nas we have already explained, allowing only such air to enter as was\r\nfirst deprived of its disturbing germs.\r\n\r\nNot till February 12th, after we had again determined the purity and\r\nbrilliant clearness of the wort, a brilliancy which we can compare with\r\nnothing so well as Cognac, without the faintest trace of cloudiness, did\r\nwe set it to ferment in a vessel similar to that in which it had cooled,\r\nbut without the false bottom. In the process of transfer we effected its\r\naeration by causing it to fall on a small inverted tinned iron capsule\r\nsome 4 or 5 centimetres (1-½ to 2 inches) in diameter. By this\r\narrangement the wort took up air to the extent of rather more than a\r\nthird of its saturate capacity, that is to say, by spreading over the\r\ncapsule, and falling from it in a kind of sheet, it absorbed a volume of\r\noxygen more than a third of the total amount of oxygen which it was\r\ncapable of absorbing at the existing temperature; this was 12° C. (53·6°\r\nF.) at the moment when the wort was drawn off. The pitching was\r\naccomplished with a 6-litre flask containing about 4 litres (7·04 pints)\r\nof beer that had been in “low” fermentation from February 3rd. The beer\r\nwas cleansed on February 24th, and had a density of 5-1/4° Balling. We\r\ncollected 2·345 kilos (75·39 oz. troy) of yeast, containing 56 per\r\ncent., that is, 1·313 kilos (42·21 oz. troy) of pressed yeast,\r\ncontaining 36·7 per cent. of yeast dried at 100° C. (212° F.), that is\r\n482 grammes (15·49 oz. troy) for the brew, which would give 241 grammes\r\n(7·748 oz. troy) of yeast formed per hectolitre (22 gallons).\r\n\r\nThe beer was turbid when drawn off, and the small glassful that we\r\nremoved did not brighten in twenty-four or even forty-eight hours. The\r\nsamples for some days previously had been in the same condition. The\r\nyeast existed as a fine deposit without any straggling yeast about the\r\nsides. The want of brightness was dependent rather on spurious colour\r\nthan on any actual turbidity. We may here remark that if in the\r\npreceding experiment the wort had taken up oxygen into combination as\r\nwell as into solution at the time that it was aerated, the other\r\nconditions being the same, the beer would have been bright and better.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this experiment that a wort may be _perfectly bright_ at\r\nthe moment when it is pitched, yet fail to produce a beer which shall be\r\nbright when racked, or one that will brighten subsequently otherwise\r\nthan with great difficulty. We may add that when we repeated this same\r\nexperiment, cooling the wort, however, as rapidly as the conditions of\r\nour apparatus permitted, and employing iced water, the beer appeared\r\nvery nearly bright when it was racked, and brightened pretty quickly in\r\ncask and in bottle. The total duration of cooling was not longer than\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\nThe question here arises what part does the oxygen combined with wort\r\nplay in the clarification of the latter, or in the clarification of\r\nbeer? Although it may be difficult to give a definite answer to this\r\nquestion, we must bear in mind that in cases where the beer brightens\r\nbest, if we examine it under the microscope during fermentation, we see,\r\nbesides the clusters of yeast-cells, floating amorphous particles, which\r\nare larger and more compact than those to which the turbidity of worts\r\nand muddy beers is due, a circumstance which should lead us to suppose\r\nthat the oxygen in combination with the wort has the effect of modifying\r\nthe nature of the amorphous deposit which is produced during the\r\nfermentation of the wort. During boiling, the hop yields to the wort a\r\nvariety of resinous, odorous, and astringent substances, which, for the\r\nmost part, are held in solution by the presence of sugar and dextrin. At\r\nthe moment when, under the influence of the yeast, which is itself more\r\nor less oxidized, the sugar becomes transformed into alcohol and\r\ncarbonic acid, a portion of the bitter and resinous matters of the hop\r\nbecomes insoluble and remains in a state of suspension in the liquid. It\r\nis very probable that at this point it is when the combined oxygen\r\nassumes its function of modifying the physical structure of these\r\ninsoluble particles, agglomerating them, so that they become more easily\r\ndeposited.[179]\r\n\r\nMoreover, oxidation tends to form a special precipitate in the wort,\r\nwhich precipitate contributes towards the collection and deposition of\r\nthe very fine particles suspended in the wort, by a mechanical action,\r\nsimilar to that which we notice in fining operations. On the coolers an\r\neffect of this kind is produced. The wort in the copper contains\r\ninsoluble matters which pass on to the coolers. Very bright when\r\nboiling, it grows turbid as it cools, and then contains two kinds of\r\ninsoluble substances: 1. Substances insoluble alike in the hot and cold\r\nliquid, some of which even, as we have just seen, are formed under the\r\ninfluence of heat and air: all these substances precipitating rapidly to\r\nthe bottom of the vessels. 2. Very fine particles insoluble in the cold,\r\nbut soluble in the hot liquid, appearing as the wort cools down, and\r\ngiving it a milky appearance. If the air does not come into play they\r\nremain in suspension for an indefinite time, so to say. Wort taken\r\nboiling from the copper and cooled down, therefore, forms a considerable\r\ndeposit at the bottom of the bottles. Now, if we put this wort into\r\nbottles without filling them, putting into some only the milky wort from\r\nabove the deposit, and into others the same wort along with some of the\r\ndeposit, then raise it to 100° C. (212° F.), and before it has time to\r\ncool down shake it up with air a good many times, it will be readily\r\nseen that the wort in the bottles containing the deposit will brighten\r\nmore rapidly and satisfactorily than those in the bottles without the\r\ndeposit. The deposits which are insoluble in the copper have, therefore,\r\nan influence on the clarification. We must add, however, that this\r\ninfluence cannot be compared with that of direct oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe “turning out” of the wort and its stay upon the coolers to a certain\r\nextent exhibit the different conditions which take part in its\r\nclarification, inasmuch as the wort charged with its insoluble matters\r\nis run off very hot, and with more or less violence against the external\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n § VI.—Application of the Principles of the New Process of Brewing with\r\n                 the Use of Limited Quantities of Air.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now an idea of the quantities of oxygen which occur, free or\r\ncombined, in the actual processes of manufacture. We know, moreover,\r\nthat an excess of air may be injurious, especially to the aroma of the\r\nbeer, and to that quality which consumers prize so highly, which goes by\r\nthe name of _bouche_. It must, therefore, be important to ascertain\r\nwhether in existing processes the proportion of active oxygen may not be\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nThe best practical means of determining this would consist in comparing\r\nthe products of different processes with progressively increasing access\r\nof air, starting from none at all, as in the case of cooling in the\r\npresence of an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas. The following\r\narrangement (Fig. 85) permits us to realize these conditions:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.]\r\n\r\nThe wort brought to a temperature between 75° and 80° C. (167° and 176°\r\nF.) in the double-bottomed vessel C, passes by the tube _a b_ into a\r\nrefrigerator, such as Baudelot’s, for example, but acting in an inverse\r\nmanner to the ordinary mode of using Baudelot’s; that is to say, the\r\nwort is made to circulate inside the tubes, whilst the cold water plays\r\non the outside.[180] The wort when cooled, its temperature being\r\nindicated by a thermometer _c_, passes down by the tube _c_DD to fill\r\nthe fermenting vessel A. This vessel is made of tinned iron, or, better\r\nstill, tinned copper, and has a cover provided with a man-hole and\r\neye-hole; _m n_ one of the tubes for the circulation of air during\r\nfermentation; its connecting-tube is not represented, it would be behind\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nAt the point _d_ there is a pipe for admission of pure air; this is\r\nrepresented on a larger scale at T. The wort, as it runs through the\r\nlarge tube, carries with it air from outside, and this air is calcined\r\non its way in by means of a flame which plays on the copper tube through\r\nwhich it passes. This arrangement supplies a third or more of the total\r\nquantity of oxygen that the wort is capable of acquiring by solution at\r\nthe temperature at which we work.\r\n\r\nF represents the arrangement of the reversed funnel in which the tube _m\r\nn_ terminates. Its mouth is closed with cotton-wool held in place\r\nbetween two pieces of wire gauze, for the purpose of purifying the air\r\nthat enters by it into the fermenting vessel during fermentation.\r\n\r\n_v_ is an entrance tap for steam, by means of which the vessel and\r\nrefrigerator are cleansed from all extraneous germs before each\r\nfermentation, and before the wort passes into the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nWhen the fermenting vessel A is at work, we may start a fermentation in\r\na second vessel in the following manner: opening a small tap situated at\r\nabout a third of the height of the vessel, we pass a few litres of the\r\nfermenting beer into a can of tinned copper, previously purified by a\r\ncurrent of steam, and filled with pure air. This can is then emptied\r\ninto the fresh vessel, an operation of no difficulty, since we have\r\nmerely to connect the tap of the can with the small tap of the vessel,\r\nand lastly, the vessel is filled with wort, which then mixes with the\r\nfermenting liquid. These various manipulations, it is evident, are\r\nperformed under conditions of complete purity, without the slightest\r\ncontact of the liquids either with the exterior air or with utensils\r\ncontaminated by disturbing germs.[181]\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that an industry adopts at once in their entirety new\r\npractices which would necessitate a re-arrangement of plant, and the\r\nprocess of which we are speaking would require such re-arrangement, as\r\nfar as the fermenting vessels and the method of cooling the wort are\r\nconcerned. The new process would, however, be of great value if once\r\nintroduced, simply for the manufacture of pure ferment and pure wort, or\r\neven for that of pure ferment alone. In other words, we might retain the\r\nordinary methods employed in low fermentation, use the same method of\r\ncooling or the new one, the same fermenting vessels, and the process of\r\nfermentation at low temperatures; the yeast, however, would be prepared\r\nin a state of purity in the closed vessel which we have described,\r\ncollected in those vessels, aerated, and then employed after the\r\nold-established custom; better still, the pitching might be performed\r\nwith beer in the act of undergoing pure fermentation.\r\n\r\nAbove the fermenting-stage there might be arranged a room for the\r\nvessels used in the new process, from which the pure beer could be run\r\nfor pitching purposes into the large tuns in the brewery below. It is\r\ntrue that beer prepared in this manner would not be perfectly pure, but\r\nfrom the results which have been obtained by working on this system,\r\nthere is no doubt that it would possess keeping qualities far superior\r\nto those of beer made with ordinary yeast, even supposing that beer to\r\nhave been treated with every possible precaution, and to be as pure as\r\nany produced in the best regulated breweries.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1874, we conducted an experiment at\r\nTantonville, in a closed vessel capable of holding 6 hectolitres (132\r\ngallons). The deposit of yeast served to pitch an open vessel, the wort\r\nof which had, moreover, been cooled under conditions of purity. The\r\ncooling had been effected by means of the Baudelot refrigerator,\r\nrepresented in Fig. 85, the wort in the closed vessel having been\r\nsimilarly treated. For shortness sake, we may designate the closed\r\nvessel and its beer by the letter K, and use the letter M for the open\r\nvessel and its beer, and T for the corresponding beer of the brewery.\r\nThe vessel K was pitched on September 4th, and racked on September 17th,\r\nthe beer then showing a density of 5·5° Balling.\r\n\r\nThe beers K and M were sent to Paris at the same time as some barrels of\r\nthe beer T, brewed by the ordinary process; and samples of these\r\ndifferent beers, which arrived on October 22nd, were procured from five\r\ndifferent cafés for purposes of examination.\r\n\r\nThe beer M did not suffer by comparison with the beer T. The similarity\r\nbetween the flavours of these two was so close as to puzzle even\r\nexperienced judges. In both cases the beer was brilliantly clear. In two\r\ncafés the beer M was even preferred to T, being considered softer on the\r\npalate (_moelleuse_) and of more decided character (_corsée_) than T, a\r\ncircumstance which may be explained by the fact that its wort had been\r\nless aerated.\r\n\r\nThe beer K, although very clear and bright, was considered inferior to\r\nM, but the sole reason of this was that at the date when it was\r\ntasted—November 3rd—it did not froth. As we have already remarked, a\r\npeculiarity of the beers made in closed vessels is that their secondary\r\nfermentation takes a longer time to develop. The yeast held in\r\nsuspension in the beer, at the moment when it is drawn off, is, in the\r\ncase of all beers, the yeast of a supplementary fermentation, if we may\r\nuse that expression. In the ordinary process of brewing, this yeast, in\r\nconsequence of the greater aeration of the wort at the commencement of\r\nfermentation, is more active, or, rather, more ready to revive and\r\nmultiply than is that which develops in closed vessels. If the barrels\r\nof the K beer had been tapped on the 12th or 15th of November, instead\r\nof on the 3rd, it is probable that they would have contained as much\r\ncarbonic acid gas as the beer M contained at the earlier date. This\r\ndelay in the resumption of fermentation, which characterizes beer made\r\nin closed vessels, is an advantage, inasmuch as it facilitates the\r\ntransmission of the beer to long distances, besides giving us the\r\nsmallest deposits of yeast in cask or bottle, as we have already pointed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the keeping qualities of the beer M and the beer T\r\n(the latter being the brewery beer), we made the following\r\nobservations:—[182]\r\n\r\nOn November 25th we began to detect in the brewery beer an unsound\r\nflavour; a large deposit, too, had formed; the beer had lost its\r\nbrilliancy, and frothed enormously. The deposit swarmed with diseased\r\nferments, especially those represented in Nos. 1 and 7 of Plate I. The\r\nbeer M, on the contrary, was in brilliant condition, with an\r\ninsignificant deposit, and an ordinary froth, if anything, rather small,\r\nand beautifully bright.\r\n\r\nOn December 3rd the beer M was still good, very clear, and in excellent\r\npreservation; it was considered by professional brewers as remarkably\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nDecember 22nd, the same beer M was still very bright and good.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20th, the beer was still bright; for the first time, however, we\r\ndetected in the deposit in the bottles, which was still small, the\r\nfilaments of turned beer. This unsoundness was in its earliest stage.\r\nNow, comparing the relative unsoundness of the two beers, we see that M\r\nkept at least two months longer than the corresponding brewery beer.\r\nThis example shows us that as far as the keeping powers and the quality\r\nof beer are concerned, the existing process would gain considerably by\r\nthe employment of pure wort and pure ferment; and, indeed, it seems\r\nlikely that the new process may be introduced into breweries with this\r\nobject in view.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the summer of 1875 we made the following observations\r\non the keeping qualities of a beer brewed on the new system, all the\r\ndetails of which had been rigorously carried out. The beer brewed at\r\nTantonville during the months of June and July, at a temperature of 13°\r\nC. (55·4° F.), in 50-litre and 80-litre casks (11 and 18-gallon), had\r\nbeen sent by slow trains to Arbois (Jura), where we were staying for a\r\ntime. The temperature of the wine cellars in which these barrels were\r\nstored was, on June 1st, 12·5° C. (54·5° F.); this rose gradually until\r\nSeptember 1st, when it attained 18° C. (64·4° F.). In this cellar the\r\nbrewery beer, brewed in the ordinary way, underwent change in the course\r\nof fifteen days or three weeks, whilst the beer brewed on the new system\r\nremained sound for several months. It is true that some of the barrels\r\nlost their frothiness, and that the beer in them underwent a peculiar\r\nvinous change, but these effects in no way depend on the conditions\r\npeculiar to the new process.\r\n\r\nComparing the beers K, M, T, of which we have been speaking, we see\r\nthat, however useful the aeration and oxidation of the wort may be in\r\nquickening fermentation and facilitating clarification, yet it is by no\r\nmeans indispensable to the success of our operations that we should\r\nintroduce into our worts large quantities of oxygen, whether by solution\r\nor combination. Beyond a certain limit—a limit which is undoubtedly\r\noverstepped in the existing process—oxygen is injurious to the palate\r\ncharacteristics and aroma of beer.\r\n\r\nThese comparisons have proved to us that the new process can be applied\r\nto wort aerated to the third of its saturate-capacity for oxygen, and\r\npitched with a good “low” yeast, taken from the fermentation of a wort\r\naerated in the same way, and that the beers thus obtained not only\r\npossess vastly superior keeping properties, but are equal in quality and\r\nsuperior in palate-fulness to beers brewed with the same wort on the\r\nexisting system. We should be perfectly justified in forming this\r\nconclusion as to the _strength_[183] of the beer furnished by the new\r\nprocess, even if on tasting it we found that the new beer M was merely\r\nequal in strength to Tourtel’s beer brewed in the ordinary manner, since\r\nthe wort in the new process, other conditions being the same, is weaker\r\nthan the same wort treated in the usual way, from not having undergone\r\nthat evaporation on the coolers which concentrates it. If we were to\r\nrestore to the concentrated wort of ordinary brewing all the water lost\r\nby it through evaporation, the beer that we should obtain would be\r\nsensibly weakened.[184]\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, is that we must employ good varieties of “low”\r\nyeast. We have seen how the employment of certain forms of yeast renders\r\nthe clarification of beers difficult, as well as extremely slow, and\r\nalmost prevents their falling bright at the end of fermentation. These\r\nyeasts, moreover, frequently impart to beer a peculiar yeast-bitten\r\nflavour, which does not disappear even after a prolonged stay in cask.\r\nEven repeated growth of these yeasts, whether in closed or in open\r\nvessels, and no matter what quantity of air we may supply them with\r\nbefore fermentation, seems to have no effect in changing their\r\ncharacter. The only thing we can do with these varieties of yeast is to\r\nget rid of them with all speed, and to replace them with others.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the comparative success that has attended various trials\r\nof the new process on the commercial scale, that process has not yet\r\nbeen practically adopted: and here we must bear in mind that we have not\r\nto deal with any casual invention or mechanical improvement that could\r\nbe introduced all at once into the working of a brewery; we are dealing\r\nwith operations of considerable delicacy, which necessitate the adoption\r\nof a special plant to carry them out. Under such conditions time and\r\nlabour are required to effect a change in the established processes of a\r\ngreat industry. This, however, cannot diminish the confidence that we\r\nhave in the future of our process, and it is our hope that the same\r\nconfidence will be shared in by all those who may give this work an\r\nattentive perusal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  M. Galland, a brewer in Maxéville, near Nancy, published with his\r\n  name, in November, 1875, a pamphlet, which was reproduced in the\r\n  brewing journals of that date, bearing the title, _It is said, “the\r\n  air being impure, let us exclude it;” I say, “The air being impure,\r\n  let us purify it.”_ These two aphorisms, together or apart, constitute\r\n  the essential novelty of my researches on beer, and M. Galland is\r\n  mistaken in attempting to appropriate the merit of the second\r\n  alternative (see my note in the _Comptes rendus_ of the 17th November,\r\n  1873, and the text of the letters-patent obtained 13th March of that\r\n  year). M. Galland has devised some arrangements for putting the latter\r\n  of these two schemes into practice; but it is possible, of course, to\r\n  effect this in a variety of ways. M. Velten, a brewer in Marseilles,\r\n  had already accomplished this in his efforts to carry out practically\r\n  the procedure advocated in the present work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  [Non-technically, stirred about.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  As stated in the paragraph on aërobian ferments, in Chapter V., “low”\r\n  yeasts, to be preserved in their state of “lowness,” must be submitted\r\n  to often-repeated growths—every fifteen days in winter and every ten\r\n  days in summer, that is to say, they must be grown afresh after each\r\n  of these intervals. If this is done, there will be no reason to\r\n  apprehend the formation of aërobian ferments, which, as we have stated\r\n  before, may embarrass us by transforming our “low” yeasts into “high”\r\n  yeasts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  It has been observed by brewers that, sometimes, without any apparent\r\n  cause, a yeast suddenly becomes inactive and fermentation ceases.\r\n  Accidents of this kind may probably be explained in the same manner as\r\n  the facts of which we are speaking. If a wort has not been aerated, or\r\n  if it has been deprived of oxygen by a commencing development of\r\n  microscopic organisms, the yeast formed in it will be very inferior,\r\n  and the fermentation may stop at its commencement or soon afterwards.\r\n  In such a case, an aeration of the yeast and wort would be the best\r\n  remedy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  PASTEUR, _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences_, vol. lii. p.\r\n  1260, and _Études sur le Vin_, 2nd Edition, p. 277.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  We may here remark that the system of gutters in the above apparatus\r\n  is much simpler than that described in connection with Figs. 76 and\r\n  77.

It no longer\r\n  now goes by that name, being called _hyposulphite of soda_, NaHSO_{2}.\r\n\r\n  The salts formerly known as _hyposulphites_ are now called\r\n  _thiosulphates_, as Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.\r\n\r\n  Thus to put them together we have:—\r\n\r\n     Hyposulphite (Hydrosulphite)             NaHSO_{2}\r\n     Bisulphite                               NaHSO_{3}\r\n     Thiosulphate (Hyposulphite)              Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}\r\n\r\n  The thiosulphates were formerly regarded as containing the elements of\r\n  water in their composition, thus:—Na_{2}H_{2}S_{2}O_{4}, which being\r\n  halved would give NaHSO_{2}, isomeric with hyposulphite, as Pasteur\r\n  says.

Schützenberger applies the term _saturated_ to a solution of\r\n  hydrosulphite prepared thus, or very nearly so; a current of\r\n  sulphurous acid is passed through a solution of commercial bisulphite\r\n  of soda, to excess; 100 c.c. (3-½ fl. oz.) of this solution and 30\r\n  grammes (46 grains) of zinc filings are put into a small flask, so as\r\n  to completely fill it; the bottle is corked up and the mixture is\r\n  shaken briskly for about a quarter of an hour. Lastly, the contents of\r\n  this flask are poured into a large 2-litre flask, with water and\r\n  containing milk of lime, prepared by mixing 100 grammes (3·2 troy oz.)\r\n  of quicklime in the water just before it is used. The whole is shaken\r\n  briskly for some minutes and then left to settle. The supernatant\r\n  liquid soon becomes bright. This is the hydrosulphite; but in this\r\n  state it is too concentrated; and should be syphoned into another\r\n  2-litre flask half full of water. In the alkaline condition this salt\r\n  absorbs gaseous oxygen much less rapidly than in the acid, so that the\r\n  liquids will retain their strength much longer, if they are kept in\r\n  well-corked bottles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  The numbers _n_ and _n´´_ will vary as the wort, or liquid which we\r\n  have to test, is perfectly neutral or otherwise.

When the\r\n  cork is completely home, the needle is withdrawn, and the elasticity\r\n  of the cork enables it to fill up the space left, so that we have the\r\n  bottle corked air-tight, and no air left between the cork and\r\n  liquid.—D. C. R.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  We have remarked in our observations on No. 6 of Plate I. (p. 6) that\r\n  amongst the amorphous granular deposits of wort and beer we often find\r\n  minute balls of resinous and colouring matter, perfectly spherical and\r\n  very dense, which if the liquids be shaken up will render them very\r\n  turbid, but which readily and rapidly deposit again, without remaining\r\n  in suspension in the least. Such then is the form in which the\r\n  deposits of wort in course of fermentation are precipitated, when the\r\n  wort has been freely exposed to oxygen. One day in the laboratory we\r\n  were desirous of starting a fermentation in a vessel capable of\r\n  holding 12 hectolitres (264 gallons). But as we only had at our\r\n  disposal a copper capable of holding 2-½ hectolitres, we procured the\r\n  wort from a neighbouring brewery in two barrels of 6 hectolitres each.\r\n  This wort we re-heated, in portions, in our 2-½ hectolitre copper, a\r\n  treatment which had the effect of oxidizing the wort more than it\r\n  would have been in the brewery. In this case the beer fell remarkably\r\n  bright, and the cells of yeast were accompanied by the deposit of\r\n  minute agglomerations sketched in Plate I., No. 6. We have repeated\r\n  this experiment on a smaller scale and have obtained the same result.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  It is evident that this arrangement may be modified in many ways. Any\r\n  of the ordinary worms, or, generally speaking, any of the more modern\r\n  refrigerators invented during the last few years, may be adopted. The\r\n  only point that is of importance is the preservation of the purity of\r\n  the wort during cooling.\r\n\r\n  The Baudelot refrigerator is extensively adopted in France; for this\r\n  reason we used it in our experiments at Tantonville. We might equally\r\n  well, by enclosing the worm in a casing of sheet iron or tinned\r\n  copper, pass our wort over the exterior of the tubes, the cold water\r\n  passing through them. The wort would cool quicker in this way than\r\n  with the arrangement described in the text, and if we arrange to admit\r\n  only pure air into the case, always under conditions of purity. The\r\n  aeration, moreover, could be made as much as we wished.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  This arrangement limits the proportion of oxygen that may be\r\n  introduced into the wort by direct oxidation. But it would be easy to\r\n  increase this at will, by causing the wort as it comes from the copper\r\n  and the hop-back to pass into a cylinder turning horizontally on its\r\n  axis and furnished with blades fixed inside, so as to divide the wort\r\n  and bring it better into contact with the air in the cylinder. Instead\r\n  of a revolving cylinder we might use a fixed vessel, in which the wort\r\n  could be stirred up by some arrangement outside. In either case we\r\n  should have to take care that the air was pure when it came into\r\n  contact with the wort, but this would be a matter of no difficulty; we\r\n  would simply have to make communication with the outer air by means of\r\n  a tube filled with cotton wool. Any air that might be in the vessel at\r\n  the moment when the wort was introduced would be purified by the high\r\n  temperature of the wort coming from the copper. We should, moreover,\r\n  gain the great advantage of being able to bring oxygen to bear on our\r\n  wort in determinate amounts. From this vessel it would pass on to the\r\n  refrigerator. We might again raise the wort oxidized on the coolers to\r\n  a temperature of 75° C. (167° F.), to recool it in this manner and\r\n  aerate it by means of the pure-air pipe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  One of the barrels of the brewery beer was bottled about the end of\r\n  October, at the same time that a barrel of M was.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Refer foot-note, page 354.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  The evaporation on the coolers varies according to the arrangements in\r\n  different breweries; but in no case is it less than several hundredths\r\n  of the total volume. One special advantage of the new process is that\r\n  it gives us, _ceteris paribus_, a volume of beer that is 5, 6, or 7\r\n  per cent. greater than that which we should obtain by the old process,\r\n  without in any way affecting the strength of the beer. It is easy to\r\n  ascertain the quantity that evaporates on the coolers, by determining\r\n  the quantity of water that must be added to a known volume of wort\r\n  coming from the coolers to bring its density back exactly to that of\r\n  the original wort, both being calculated to the same temperature.\r\n  Bate’s English saccharometer, which shows differences of nearly\r\n  1/1000th in density, may be employed with advantage in this\r\n  determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst this work was passing through the press there appeared two small\r\nworks on the subject of the generation of inferior organisms.\r\n\r\nOne of them was by M. Fremy. The author’s object seems to have been\r\nmerely to give an account, under a new form, of the part which he took\r\nin the discussion on the origin of ferments that was carried on before\r\nthe Academy of Sciences in 1871-1872. In the course of that discussion\r\nM. Fremy had announced his intention of publishing an extensive Memoir,\r\nfull of facts, bearing on the subject. The perusal of the promised work\r\ngave us much disappointment. Not only were our experiments, and the\r\nconclusions which we drew from them, given there, for the most part in a\r\nmanner which we could not possibly accept, but, moreover, M. Fremy had\r\nconfined himself to deducing, by the help of his favourite hypothesis, a\r\nseries of _à priori_ opinions based on half-finished experiments, not\r\none of which, in our opinion, had been brought to the state of\r\ndemonstration. To tell the truth, his work was the romance of\r\nhemi-organism, just as M. Pouchet’s work of an earlier date was the\r\nromance of heterogenesis. And yet, what could be clearer than the\r\nsubject under discussion? We maintain, adducing incontestable\r\nexperimental evidence in support of our theory, that living, organized\r\nferments spring only from similar organisms likewise endowed with life;\r\nand that the germs of these ferments exist in a state of suspension in\r\nthe air, or on the exterior surface of objects. M. Fremy asserts that\r\nthese ferments are formed by the force of hemi-organism acting on\r\nalbuminous substances, in contact with air. We may put the matter more\r\nprecisely by two examples:—\r\n\r\nWine is produced by a ferment, that is to say, by minute, vegetative\r\ncells which multiply by budding. According to us, the germs of these\r\ncells abound in autumn on the surface of grapes and the woody parts of\r\ntheir bunches; and the proofs which we have given of this fact are as\r\nclear as any evidence can be. According to M. Fremy, the cells of\r\nferment are produced by spontaneous generation, that is to say, by the\r\ntransformation of nitrogenous substances contained in the juice of the\r\ngrape, as soon as that juice is brought into contact with air.\r\n\r\nAgain, blood flows from a vein; it putrefies, and in a very short time\r\nswarms with bacteria or vibrios. According to us the germs of these\r\nbacteria and vibrios have been introduced by particles of dust floating\r\nin the air or derived from the surface of objects, possibly the body of\r\nthe wounded animal, or the vessels employed, or a variety of other\r\nobjects. M. Fremy, on the other hand, asserts that these bacteria or\r\nvibrios are produced spontaneously, because the albumen, and the fibrin\r\nof the blood themselves possess a semi-organization, which causes them,\r\nwhen in contact with air, to change spontaneously into these\r\nmarvellously active minute beings.\r\n\r\nHas M. Fremy given any proof of the truth of his theory? By no manner of\r\nmeans; he confines himself to asserting that things are as he says they\r\nare. He is constantly speaking of hemi-organism and its effects, but we\r\ndo not find his affirmations supported by a single experimental proof.\r\nThere is, nevertheless, a very simple means of testing the truth of the\r\ntheory of hemi-organism; and on this point M. Fremy and ourselves are\r\nquite at one. This means consists in taking a quantity of grape juice,\r\nblood, wine, &c., from the very interior of the organs which contain\r\nthose liquids, with the necessary precautions to avoid contact with the\r\nparticles of dust in suspension in the air or spread over objects.\r\nAccording to the hypothesis of M. Fremy, these liquids must of necessity\r\nferment in the presence of pure air. According to us, the very opposite\r\nof this must be the case. Here, then, is a crucial experiment of the\r\nmost decisive kind for determining the merits of the rival theories, a\r\ncriterion, moreover, which M. Fremy perfectly admits. In 1863, and again\r\nin 1872, we published the earliest experiments that were made in\r\naccordance with this decisive method. The result was as follows:—The\r\ngrape juice did not ferment in vessels full of air, air deprived of its\r\nparticles of dust—that is to say, it did not produce any of the ferments\r\nof wine; the blood did not putrefy—that is to say, it yielded neither\r\nbacteria nor vibrios; urine did not become ammoniacal—that is to say, it\r\ndid not give rise to any organism; in a word the origin of life\r\nmanifested itself in no single instance.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of arguments so irresistible as these, M. Fremy,\r\nthroughout the 250 pages of his work, continues to repeat that these\r\nresults, which, he admits, seem subversive of his theory, are,\r\nnevertheless, explicable by the circumstance that the air in our\r\nvessels, although pure at first, underwent a sudden chemical change when\r\nit came in contact with the blood, or urine, or grape juice; that the\r\noxygen became converted into carbonic acid gas, and that, in\r\nconsequence, hemi-organism could no longer exercise its force. We are\r\nastonished at this assertion, for M. Fremy must be aware that, since\r\n1863, we have given analyses of the air in our vessels after they had\r\nremained sterile for several days—for ten, twenty, thirty, or forty\r\ndays—at the highest atmospheric temperatures, and that oxygen was still\r\npresent, often even in proportions almost identical with those to be\r\nfound in atmospheric air.[185] Why has M. Fremy made no allusion to\r\nthese analyses? This was the chief, the essential point in question.\r\nBesides, if M. Fremy had wished to test the truth of his explanation,\r\nthere was a very simple means of restoring the purity of the air in\r\ncontact with the liquids open to him; he might have passed through his\r\nvessels a slow and continuous current of pure air, day and night. We\r\nhave done this a hundred times, and we have always found that the\r\nsterility of the putrescible or fermentable liquids remained unaffected.\r\n\r\nThe hemi-organism hypothesis is, therefore, absolutely untenable, and we\r\nhave no doubt that our learned friend will eventually declare as much\r\nbefore the Academy, since he has more than once publicly expressed his\r\nreadiness to do so as soon as our demonstrations appear convincing to\r\nhim. How can he resist the evidence of such facts and proofs?\r\nPersistence in such a course can benefit nobody, but it may depreciate\r\nthe dignity of science in general esteem. It would gratify us extremely\r\nto find the rigorous exactness of our studies on this subject\r\nacknowledged by M. Fremy, and regarded by that gentleman with the same\r\nfavour bestowed upon it everywhere abroad. It may be doubted if there\r\nexists at the present day a single person beyond the Rhine who believes\r\nin the correctness of Liebig’s theory, of which M. Fremy’s hemi-organism\r\nis merely a variation. If M. Fremy still hesitates to accept our\r\ndemonstrations, the observations of Mr. Tyndall may effect his\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nThe other publication to which we alluded was the work of the celebrated\r\nEnglish physicist, John Tyndall. It was read before the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, at a meeting held on January 13, 1876.\r\n\r\nThe following letter explains how the illustrious successor of Faraday\r\nat the Royal Institution came to undertake these researches:—\r\n\r\n    “London, February 16, 1876.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Pasteur,—\r\n\r\n    “In the course of the last few years a number of works bearing such\r\n    titles as ‘The Beginnings of Life’; ‘Evolution and the Origin of\r\n    Life,’ &c., have been published in England by a young physician, Dr.\r\n    Bastian. The same author has also published a considerable number of\r\n    articles in different reviews and journals. The very circumstantial\r\n    manner in which he describes his experiments, and the tone of\r\n    assurance with which he advances his conclusions, have produced an\r\n    immense impression on the English as well as the American public.\r\n    But what is more serious still, from a practical point of view, is\r\n    the influence that these writings have exercised on the medical\r\n    world. He has attacked your works with great vigour, and, although\r\n    he has made but slight impression on those who know them thoroughly,\r\n    yet he has succeeded in producing a very great and, I may add, a\r\n    very pernicious one on others.\r\n\r\n    “The state of confusion and uncertainty had come to be so great\r\n    that, about six months ago, I thought that I should be rendering a\r\n    service to science, and at the same time performing an act of\r\n    justice to yourself, in submitting the question to a fresh\r\n    investigation. Putting into execution an idea which I had\r\n    entertained for some six years, the details of which were set forth\r\n    in an article in the _British Medical Journal_, which I had the\r\n    pleasure of sending you, I have gone over a great deal of the ground\r\n    on which Dr. Bastian had taken his stand, and, I believe, refuted\r\n    many of the errors by which the public had been misled.\r\n\r\n    “The change which has taken place since then in the tone of the\r\n    English medical journals is quite remarkable, and I am inclined to\r\n    think that the general confidence of the public in the exactness of\r\n    Dr. Bastian’s experiments has been considerably shaken.\r\n\r\n    “In taking up these researches again, I have had occasion to refresh\r\n    my memory by another perusal of your works; they have revived in me\r\n    all the admiration which I experienced when I first read them. It is\r\n    my intention now to pursue these researches until I have dissipated\r\n    any doubts that may be entertained in respect to the unassailable\r\n    exactness of your conclusions.\r\n\r\n    “For the first time in the history of science, we are justified in\r\n    cherishing confidently the hope that, as far as epidemic diseases\r\n    are concerned, medicine will soon be delivered from empiricism, and\r\n    placed on a real scientific basis; when that great day shall come,\r\n    humanity will, in my opinion, recognise the fact that the greatest\r\n    part of its gratitude will be due to you.\r\n\r\n    “Believe me, ever very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    “JOHN TYNDALL.”\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely say that we read this letter with the liveliest\r\ngratification, and were delighted to learn that our studies had received\r\nthe support of one renowned in the scientific world alike for the\r\nrigorous accuracy of his experiments as for the lucid and picturesque\r\nclearness of all his writings. The reward as well as the ambition of the\r\nman of science consists in earning the approbation of his\r\nfellow-workers, or that of those whom he esteems as masters.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyndall has observed this remarkable fact, that in a box, the sides\r\nof which are coated with glycerine, and the dimensions of which may be\r\nvariable and of considerable size, all the particles of dust floating in\r\nthe air inside fall and adhere to the glycerine in the course of a few\r\ndays. The air in the case is then as pure as that in our double-necked\r\nflasks. Moreover, a transmitted ray of light will tell us the moment\r\nwhen this purity is obtained. Mr. Tyndall has proved, in fact, that to\r\nan eye rendered sensitive by remaining in darkness for a little, the\r\ncourse of the ray is visible as long as there are any floating particles\r\nof dust capable of reflecting or diffusing light, and that, on the other\r\nhand, it becomes quite obscure and invisible to the same eye as soon as\r\nthe air has deposited all its solid particles. When it has done this,\r\nwhich it will do very quickly in two or three days, if we employ one of\r\nthe boxes used by Mr. Tyndall—it has been proved that any organic\r\ninfusions whatever may be preserved in the case without undergoing the\r\nleast putrefactive change, and without producing bacteria.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, bacteria will swarm in similar infusions, after an\r\ninterval of from two to four days, if the vessels which contain them are\r\nexposed to the air by which the cases are surrounded. Mr. Tyndall can\r\ndrop into his boxes, at any time he wishes, some blood from a vein or an\r\nartery of an animal, and show conclusively that such blood will not,\r\nunder these circumstances, undergo any putrefactive change.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyndall concludes his work with a consideration of the probable\r\napplication of the results given in his paper to the etiology of\r\ncontagious diseases. We share his views on this subject entirely, and we\r\nare obliged to him for having recalled to mind the following statement\r\nfrom our _Studies on the Silkworm Disease_:—“Man has it in his power to\r\ncause parasitic diseases to disappear off the surface of the globe, if,\r\nas we firmly believe, the doctrine of spontaneous generation is a\r\nchimera.”\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nFootnote
