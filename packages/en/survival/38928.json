This is a sufficient guarantee that accuracy has not been\r\nsacrificed to popular explanation.\r\n\r\nJ. G. M'P.\r\n\r\n  RUTHVEN MANSE,\r\n  _June 10, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThough by familiarity made commonplace, the \"weather\" is one of the most\r\nimportant topics of conversation, and has constant bearings upon the work\r\nand prospects of business-men and men of pleasure. The state of the\r\nweather is the password when people meet on the country road: we could not\r\ndo without the humble talisman. \"A fine day\" comes spontaneously to the\r\nlips, whatever be the state of the atmosphere, unless it is peculiarly and\r\nstrikingly repulsive; then \"A bitter day\" would take the place of the\r\nexpression. Yet I have heard \"_Terrible_ guid wither\" as often as\r\n\"_Terrible_ bad day\" among country people.\r\n\r\nScarcely a friendly letter is penned without a reference to the weather,\r\nas to what has been, is, or may be. It is a new stimulus to a lagging\r\nconversation at any dinner-table. All are so dependent on the weather,\r\nespecially those getting up in years or of delicate health.\r\n\r\nI remember, when at Strathpeffer, the great health-resort in the North of\r\nScotland, in 1885, an anxious invalid at \"The Pump\" asking a\r\nweather-beaten, rheumatic old gamekeeper what sort of a day it was to be,\r\nconsidering that it had been wet for some time. The keeper crippled to the\r\nbarometer outside the doorway, and returned with the matter-of-fact\r\nanswer: \"She's faurer doon ta tay nur she wass up yestreen.\" The barometer\r\nhad evidently fallen during the night. \"And what are we to expect?\" sadly\r\ninquired the invalid. \"It'll pe aither ferry wat, or mohr rain\"--a poor\r\nconsolation!\r\n\r\nMost men who are bent on business or pleasure, and all dwellers in the\r\ncountry who have the instruments, make a first call at the barometer in\r\nthe lobby, or the aneroid in the breakfast-parlour, to \"see what she\r\nsays.\" A good rise of the black needle (that is, to the right) above the\r\nyellow needle is a source of rejoicing, as it will likely be clear, dry,\r\nand hard weather. A slight fall (that is, to the left) causes anxiety as\r\nto coming rain, and a big depression forebodes much rain or a violent\r\nstorm of wind. In either case of \"fall,\" the shutters come over the eyes\r\nof the observer. Next, even before breakfast, a move is made to the\r\nself-registering thermometer (set the night before) on a stone, a couple\r\nof feet above the grass. A good reading, above the freezing-point in\r\nwinter and much above it in summer, indicates the absence of killing\r\nrimes, that are generally followed by rain. A very low register accounts\r\nfor the feeling of cold during the night, though the fires were not out;\r\nand predicts precarious weather. Ordinarily careful observers--as I, who\r\nhave been in one place for more than thirty years--can, with the morning\r\nindications of these two instruments, come pretty sure of their\r\nprognostics of the day's weather. Of course, the morning newspaper is\r\ncarefully scanned as to the weather-forecasts from the London\r\nMeteorological Office--direction of wind; warm, mild, or cold; rain or\r\nfair, and so on--and in general these indications are wonderfully accurate\r\nfor twenty-four hours; though the \"three days'\" prognostics seem to\r\nstretch a point. We are hardly up to that yet.\r\n\r\nThe lower animals are very sensitive as to the state of approaching\r\nextremes of weather. \"Thae sea beass,\" referring to sea-gulls over the\r\ninland leas during ploughing, are ordinary indicators of stormy weather.\r\nWind is sure to follow violent wheelings of crows. \"Beware of rain\" when\r\nthe sheep are restive, rubbing themselves on tree stumps. But all are\r\nfamiliar with Jenner's prognostics of rain.\r\n\r\nScience has come to the aid of ordinary weather-lore during the last\r\ntwenty years, by leaps and bounds. Time-honoured notions and revered\r\nfictions, around which the hallowed associations of our early training\r\nfondly and firmly cling, must now yield to the exact handling of modern\r\nscience; and with reluctance we have to part with them. Yet there is in\r\nall a fascination to account for certain ordinary phenomena. \"The man in\r\nthe street,\" as well as the strong reading man, wishes to know the \"why\"\r\nand the \"how\" of weather-forecasting. They are anxious to have\r\nweather-phenomena explained in a plain, interesting, but accurate way.\r\n\r\nThe freshness of the marvellous results has an irresistible charm for the\r\nopen mind, keen for useful information. The discoveries often seem so\r\nsimple that one wonders why they were not made before.\r\n\r\nUntil about twenty years ago, Meteorology was comparatively far back as a\r\nscience; and in one important branch of it, no one has done more to put\r\nweather-lore on a scientific basis than Dr. John Aitken, F.R.S., who has\r\nvery kindly given me his full permission to popularise what I like of his\r\nnumerous and very valuable scientific papers in the _Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh_. This I have done my best to carry out in the\r\nfollowing pages. \"The way of putting it\" is my only claim.\r\n\r\nMany scientific men are decoyed on in the search for truth with a spell\r\nunknown to others: the anticipation of the results sometimes amounts to a\r\npassion. Many wrong tracks do they take, yet they start afresh, just as\r\nthe detective has to take several courses before he hits upon the correct\r\nscent. When they succeed, they experience a pleasure which is\r\nindescribable; to them fame is more than a mere \"fancied life in others'\r\nbreath.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Aitken's continued experiments, often of rare ingenuity and\r\nbrilliancy, show that no truth is altogether barren; and even that which\r\nlooks at first sight the very simplest and most trivial may turn out\r\nfruitful in precious results. Small things must not be overlooked, for\r\ngreat discoveries are sometimes at a man's very door. Dr. Aitken has shown\r\nus this in many of his discoveries which have revolutionised a branch of\r\nmeteorology. Prudence, patience, observing power, and perseverance in\r\nscientific research will do much to bring about unexpected results, and\r\nnot more so in any science than in accounting for weather-lore on a\r\nrational basis, which it is in the power of all my readers to further.\r\n\r\n\"The old order changeth, giving place to new.\" With kaleidoscopic variety\r\nNature's face changes to the touch of the anxious and reverent observer.\r\nAnd some of these curious weather-views will be disclosed in these pages,\r\nso as, in a brief but readable way, to explain the weather, and lay a safe\r\nbasis for probable forecastings, which will be of great benefit to the man\r\nof business as well as the man of pleasure.\r\n\r\n  \"Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.\"\r\n                                          --VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF DEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of the Book of Job gravely asked the important question, \"Who\r\nhath begotten the drops of dew?\" We repeat the question in another form,\r\n\"Whence comes the real dew? Does it fall from the heavens above, or does\r\nit rise from the earth beneath?\"\r\n\r\nUntil about the beginning of the seventeenth century, scientific men held\r\nthe opinion of ordinary observers that dew fell from the atmosphere. But\r\nthere was then a reaction from this theory, for Nardius defined it as an\r\nexhalation from the earth. Of course, it was well known that dew was\r\nformed by the precipitation of the vapour of the air upon a colder body.\r\nYou can see that any day for yourself by bringing a glass of very cold\r\nwater into a warm room; the outer surface of the glass is dimmed at once\r\nby the moisture from the air. M. Picket was puzzled when he saw that a\r\nthermometer, suspended five feet above the ground, marked a lower\r\ntemperature on clear nights than one suspended at the height of\r\nseventy-five feet; because it was always supposed that the cold of evening\r\ndescended from above. Again he was puzzled when he observed that a buried\r\nthermometer read higher than one on the surface of the ground. Until\r\nrecently the greatest authority on dew was Dr. Wells, who carefully\r\nconverged all the rays of scientific light upon the subject. He came to\r\nthe conclusion that dew was condensed out of the air.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of the true theory was left to Dr. John Aitken, F.R.S.,\r\na distinguished observer and a practical physicist, of whom Scotland has\r\nreason to be proud. About twenty years ago he made the discovery, and it\r\nis now accepted by all scientific men on the Continent as well as in Great\r\nBritain. What first caused him to doubt Dr. Wells' theory, so universally\r\naccepted, that dew is formed of vapour existing at the time in the air,\r\nand to suppose that dew is mostly formed of vapour rising from the ground,\r\nwas the result of some observations made in summer on the temperature of\r\nthe soil at a small depth under the surface, and of the air over it, after\r\nsunset and at night. He was struck with the unvarying fact that the\r\nground, a little below the surface, was warmer than the air over it. By\r\nplacing a thermometer among stems below the surface, he found that it\r\nregistered 18 deg. Fahr. higher than one on the surface. So long, then, as\r\nthe surface of the ground is above the dew-point (_i.e._ the temperature\r\nwhen dew begins to be formed), vapour must rise from the ground; this\r\nmoist air will mingle with the air which it enters, and its moisture will\r\nbe condensed and form dew, whenever it comes in contact with a surface\r\ncooled below the dew-point.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this by simple experiments. Take a thin, shallow, metal\r\ntray, painted black, and place it over the ground after sunset. On dewy\r\nnights the _inside_ of the tray is dewed, and the grass inside is wetter\r\nthan that outside. On some nights there is no dew outside the tray, and on\r\nall nights the deposit on the inner is heavier than that on the outside.\r\nIf wool is used in the experiments, we are reminded of one of the forms of\r\nthe dewing of Gideon's fleece--the fleece was bedewed when all outside was\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nYou therefore naturally and rightly come to the conclusion that far more\r\nvapour rises out of the ground during the night than condenses as dew on\r\nthe grass, and that this vapour from the ground is trapped by the tray.\r\nMuch of the rising vapour is generally carried away by the passing wind,\r\nhowever gentle; hence we have it condensed as dew on the roofs of houses,\r\nand other places, where you would think that it had fallen from above. The\r\nvapour rising under the tray is not diluted by the mixture with the drier\r\nair which is occasioned by the passing wind; therefore, though only cooled\r\nto the same extent as the air outside, it yields a heavier deposit of\r\ndew.\r\n\r\nIf you place the tray on bare ground, you will find on a dewy night that\r\nthe inside of the tray is quite wet. On a dewy night you will observe that\r\nthe under part of the gravel of the road is dripping wet when the top is\r\ndry. You will find, too, that around pieces of iron and old implements in\r\nthe field, there is a very marked increase of grass, owing to the deposit\r\nof moisture on these articles--moisture which has been condensed by the\r\ncold metal from the vapour-charged air, which has risen from the ground on\r\ndewy nights.\r\n\r\nBut all doubt upon this important matter is removed by a most successful\r\nexperiment with a fine balance, which weighs to a quarter of a grain. If\r\nvapour rises from the ground for any length of time during dewy nights,\r\nthe soil which gives off the vapour must lose weight. To test this, cut\r\nfrom the lawn a piece of turf six inches square and a quarter of an inch\r\nthick. Place this in a shallow pan, and carefully note the weight of both\r\nturf and pan with the sensitive balance. To prevent loss by evaporation,\r\nthe weighing should be done in an open shed. Then place the pan and turf\r\nat sunset in the open cut. Five hours afterwards remove and weigh them,\r\nand it will be found that the turf has lost a part of its weight. The\r\nvapour which rose from the ground during the formation of the dew accounts\r\nfor the difference of weight. This weighing-test will also succeed on bare\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with hoar-frost, which is just frozen dew, we shall find\r\nvisible evidence of the rising of dew from the ground.\r\n\r\nYou know the beautiful song, \"Annie Laurie,\" which begins with--\r\n\r\n  \"Maxwelton's braes are bonnie,\r\n  Where early fa's the dew\"--\r\n\r\nwell, you can no longer say that the dew \"falls,\" for it rises from the\r\nground. The song, however, will be sung as sweetly as ever; for the spirit\r\nof true poetry defies the cold letter of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTRUE AND FALSE DEW\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since men could observe and think, they have admired the diamond\r\nglobules sparkling in the rising sun. These \"dew-drops\" were considered to\r\nbe shed from the bosom of the morn into the blooming flowers and rich\r\ngrass-leaves. Ballantine's beautiful song of Providential care tells us\r\nthat \"Ilka blade o' grass keps it's ain drap o' dew.\"\r\n\r\nBut, alas! we have to bid \"good-bye\" to the appellation \"dew-drop.\" What\r\nwas popularly and poetically called dew _is not dew at all_. Then what is\r\nit?\r\n\r\nOn what we have been accustomed to call a \"dewy\" night, after the\r\nbrilliant summer sun has set, and the stars begin to peep out of the\r\nalmost cloudless sky, let us take a look at the produce of our vegetable\r\ngarden. On the broccoli are found glistening drops; but on the peas,\r\ngrowing next them, we find nothing.\r\n\r\nA closer examination shows us that the moisture on the plants is not\r\narranged as would be expected from the ordinary laws of radiation and\r\ncondensation. There is no generally filmy appearance over the leaves; the\r\nmoisture is collected in little drops placed at short distances apart,\r\nalong the edges of the leaves all round.\r\n\r\nNow place a lighted lantern below one of the blades of the broccoli, and a\r\nrevelation will be made. The brilliant diamond-drops that fringe the edge\r\nof the blade are all placed at the points where the nearly colourless\r\nveins of the blade come to the outer edge. The drops are not dew at all,\r\nbut the exudation of the healthy plant, which has been conveyed up these\r\nveins by strong root-pressure.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the root acts as a kind of force-pump, and keeps up a\r\nconstant pressure inside the tissues of the plant. One of the simplest\r\nexperiments suggested by Dr. Aitken is to lift a single grass-plant, with\r\na clod of moist earth attached to it, and place it on a plate with an\r\ninverted tumbler over it. In about an hour, drops will begin to exude, and\r\nthe tip of nearly every blade will be found to be studded with a\r\ndiamond-like drop.\r\n\r\nNext substitute water-pressure. Remove a blade of broccoli and connect it\r\nby means of an india-rubber tube with a head of water of about forty\r\ninches. Place a glass receiver over it, so as to check evaporation, and\r\nleave it for an hour. The plant will be found to have excreted water\r\nfreely, some parts of the leaves being quite wet, while drops are\r\ncollected at the places where they appeared at night.\r\n\r\nIf the water pressed into the leaf is coloured with aniline blue, the\r\ndrops when they first appear are colourless; but before they grow to any\r\nsize, the blue appears, showing that little water was held in the veins.\r\nThe whole leaf soon gets coloured of a fine deep blue-green, like that\r\nseen when vegetation is rank; this shows that the injected liquid has\r\npenetrated through the whole leaf.\r\n\r\nAgain, the surfaces of the leaves of these drop-exuding plants never seem\r\nto be wetted by the water. It is because of the rejection of water by the\r\nleaf-surface that the exuded moisture from the veins remains as a drop.\r\n\r\nThese observations and experiments establish the fact that the drops which\r\nfirst make their appearance on grass on dewy nights are not dew-drops at\r\nall, but the exuded watery juices of the plants.\r\n\r\nIf now we look at dead leaves we shall find a difference of formation of\r\nthe moisture on a dewy night: the moisture is spread equally over, where\r\nequally exposed. The moisture exuded by the healthy grass is always found\r\nat a _point_ situated near the tip of the blade, forming a drop of some\r\nsize; but the true dew collects later on _evenly_ all over the blade. The\r\nfalse dew forms a large glistening diamond-drop, whereas the true dew\r\ncoats the blade with a fine pearly lustre. Brilliant globules are produced\r\nby the vital action of the plant, especially beautiful when the deep-red\r\nsetting sun makes them glisten, all a-tremble, with gold light; while an\r\ninfinite number of minute but shining opal-like particles of moisture\r\nbedecks the blade-surfaces, in the form of the gentle dew--\r\n\r\n  \"Like that which kept the heart of Eden green\r\n  Before the useful trouble of the rain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOAR-FROST\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in this country are familiar with the beauty of hoar-frost. The\r\nchildren are delighted with the funny figures on the glass of the bedroom\r\nwindow on a cold winter morning. Frost is a wonderful artist; during the\r\nnight he has been dipping his brush into something like diluted schist,\r\nand laying it gracefully on the smooth panes.\r\n\r\nAnd, as you walk over the meadows, you observe the thin white films of ice\r\non the green pasture; and the clear, slender blades seem like crystal\r\nspears, or the \"lashes of light that trim the stars.\"\r\n\r\nYou all know what hoar-frost is, though most in the country give it the\r\nexpressive name of \"rime.\" But you are not all aware of how it is formed.\r\nHoar-frost is just frozen dew. In a learned paper, written in 1784,\r\nProfessor Wilson of Glasgow made this significant remark: \"This is a\r\nsubject which, besides its entire novelty, seems, upon other accounts, to\r\nhave a claim to some attention.\" He observed, in that exceptionally cold\r\nwinter, that, when sheets of paper and plates of metal were laid out, all\r\nbegan to attract hoar-frost as soon as they had time to cool down to the\r\ntemperature of the air. He was struck with the fact that, while the\r\nthermometer indicated 36 degrees of frost a few feet above the ground and\r\n44 degrees of frost at the surface of the snow, there were only 8 degrees\r\nof frost at a point 3 inches below the surface of the snow. If he had\r\nonly thought of placing the thermometer on the grass, under the snow, he\r\nwould have found it to register the freezing-point only. And had he\r\ninserted the instrument below the ground, he would have found it\r\nregistering a still higher temperature. That fact would have suggested to\r\nhim the formation of hoar-frost; that the water-vapour from the warm soil\r\nwas trapped by a cold stratum of air and frozen when in the form of dew.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting experiments, without apparatus, which you can\r\nmake is in connection with the formation of hoar-frost, when there is no\r\nsnow on the ground, in very cold weather. If it has been a bright, clear,\r\nsunny day in January, the effect can be better observed. Look over the\r\ngarden, grass, and walks on the morning after the intense cold of the\r\nnight; big plane-tree leaves may be found scattered over the place. You\r\nsee little or no hoar-frost on the _upper_ surface of the leaves. But turn\r\nup the surface next the earth, or the road, or the grass, and what do you\r\nsee? You have only to handle the leaf in this way to be brightly\r\nastonished. A thick white coating of hoar-frost, as thick as a layer of\r\nsnow, is on the _under_ surface. If a number of leaves have been\r\noverlapping each other, there will be no coating of hoar-frost under the\r\ntop leaves; but when you reach the lowest layer, next the bare ground, you\r\nwill find the hoar-frost on the under surface of the leaves. Now that is\r\npositive proof that the hoar-frost has not fallen from the air, but has\r\nrisen from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe sun's heat on the previous day warmed the earth. This heat the earth\r\nretained till evening. As the air chilled, the water-vapour from the\r\nwarmer earth rose from its surface, and was arrested by the cold surface\r\nof the leaves. So cold was that surface that it froze the water-vapour\r\nwhen rising from the earth, and formed hoar-frost in very large\r\nquantities. When this happens later on in the season, one may be almost\r\nsure of having rain in the forenoon.\r\n\r\nAs hoar-frost is just frozen dew, I can even more surely convince you of\r\nthe formation of hoar-frost as rising from the ground by observations made\r\nby me at my manse in Strathmore, in June 1892. I mention this particularly\r\nbecause then was the most favourable testing-time that has _ever_ occurred\r\nduring meteorological observations. June 9th was the warmest June day\r\n(with one exception) for twenty years. The thermometer reached 83 deg. Fahr.\r\nin the shade. Next day was the coldest June day (with one exception) for\r\ntwenty years, when the thermometer was as low as 51 deg. in the shade. But\r\nduring the night my thermometer on the grass registered 32 deg.--the freezing\r\npoint. On the evening of the sultry day I examined the soil at 10 o'clock.\r\nIt was damp, and the grass round it was filmy moist. The leaves of the\r\ntrees were crackling dry, and all above was void of moisture. The air\r\nbecame gradually chilly; and as gradually the moisture rose in height on\r\nthe shrubs and lower branches of small trees. The moon shone bright, and\r\nthe stars showed their clear, chilly eyes. The soil soon became quite wet,\r\nthe low grass was dripping with moisture, and the longer grass was\r\nbecoming dewed. This gave the best natural evidence of the rising of the\r\ndew that I ever witnessed. But everything was favourable for the\r\nobservation--the cold air incumbent on the rising, warm, moist vapour from\r\nthe soil fixing the dew-point, when the projecting blades seized the\r\nmoisture greedily and formed dew. Had the temperature been a little below\r\nthe freezing-point, hoar-frost would have been beautifully formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFOG\r\n\r\n\r\nTo many nothing is more troublesome than a dense fog in a large town. It\r\nparalyses traffic, it is dangerous to pedestrians, it encourages theft, it\r\nchokes the asthmatic, and chills the weak-lunged.\r\n\r\nIn the country it is disagreeable enough; but never so intensely raw and\r\ndense as in the city. On the sea, too, the fog is disagreeable and fraught\r\nwith danger. The fog-horn is heard, in its deep, sombre note, from the\r\nlighthouse tower, when the strong artificial light is almost useless.\r\n\r\nBut a peculiar sense of stagnation possesses the dweller of the large\r\ntown, when enveloped in a dense fog. Sometimes during the day, through a\r\nthinner portion, the sun will be dimly seen in copper hue, like the moon\r\nunder an eclipse. The smoke-impregnated mass assumes a peculiar \"pea-soup\"\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nNow, what is this fog? How is it formed? It has been ascertained that fogs\r\nare dependent upon _dust_ for their formation. Without dust there could\r\nbe no fogs, there would be only dew on the grass and road. Instead of the\r\ndust-impregnated air that irritates the housekeeper, there would be the\r\nconstant dripping of moisture on the walls, which would annoy her more.\r\n\r\nOcular demonstration can testify to this. If two closed glass receivers be\r\nplaced beside each other, the one containing ordinary air, and the other\r\nfiltered air (_i.e._ air deprived of its dust by being driven through\r\ncotton wool), and if jets of steam be successively introduced into these,\r\na strange effect is noticed. In the vessel containing common air the steam\r\nwill be seen rising in a dense cloud; then a beautiful white foggy cloud\r\nwill be formed, so dense that it cannot be seen through. But in the vessel\r\ncontaining the filtered air, the steam is not seen at all; there is not\r\nthe slightest appearance of cloudiness. In the one case, where there was\r\nthe ordinary atmospheric dust, fog at once appeared; in the other case,\r\nwhere there was no dust in suspension, the air remained clear and\r\ndestitute of fog. Invisible dust, then, is necessary in the air for the\r\nformation of fogs.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is that a free-surface must exist for the condensation\r\nof the vapour-particles. The fine particles of dust in the air act as\r\nfree-surfaces, on which the fog is formed. Where there is abundance of\r\ndust in the air and little water-vapour present, there is an\r\nover-proportion of dust-particles; and the fog-particles are, in\r\nconsequence, closely packed, but light in form and small in size, and take\r\nthe lighter appearance of fog. Accordingly, if the dust is increased in\r\nthe air, there is a proportionate increase of fog. Every fog-particle,\r\nthen, has embosomed in it an invisible dust-particle.\r\n\r\nBut whence comes the dust? From many sources. It is organic and inorganic.\r\nSo very fine is the inorganic dust in the atmosphere that, if the\r\ntwo-thousandth part of a grain of fine iron be heated, and the dust be\r\ndriven off and carried into a glass receiver of filtered air, the\r\nintroduction of a jet of steam into that receiver would at once occasion\r\nan appreciable cloudiness.\r\n\r\nThis is why fogs are so prevalent in large towns. Next the minute\r\nbrine-particles, driven into the air as fog forms above the ocean surface,\r\nare the burnt sulphur-particles emanating from the chimneys in towns. The\r\nbrilliant flame, as well as the smoky flame, is a fog-producer. If gas is\r\nburnt in filtered air, intense fog is produced when water-vapour is\r\nintroduced. Products of combustion from a clear fire and from a smoky one\r\nproduce equal fogging. The fogs that densely fill our large towns are\r\ngenerally less bearable than those that veil the hills and overhang the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nIt is the sulphur, however, from the consumed coals, which is the active\r\nproducer of the fogs of a large town. The burnt sulphur condenses in the\r\nair to very fine particles, and the quantity of burnt sulphur is enormous.\r\nNo less than seven and a half millions of tons of coals are consumed in\r\nLondon. Now, the average amount of sulphur in English coal is one and a\r\nquarter per cent. That would give no less than 93,750 tons of sulphur\r\nburned every year in London fires. Now, if we reckon that on an average\r\ntwice the quantity of coals is consumed there on a winter day that is\r\nconsumed on a summer day, no less than 347 tons of the products of\r\ncombustion (in extremely fine particles) are driven into the\r\nsuperincumbent air of London every winter day. This is an enormous\r\nquantity, quite sufficient to account for the density of the fogs in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBERING OF THE DUST\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the shutters be all but closed in a room, when the sun is shining in,\r\nmyriads of floating particles can be seen glistening in the stream of\r\nlight. Their number seems inexhaustible. According to Milton, the follies\r\nof life are--\r\n\r\n                    \"Thick and numberless,\r\n  As the gay motes that people the sunbeams.\"\r\n\r\nCan these, then, be counted? Yes, Dr. Aitken has numbered the dust of the\r\nair. I shall never forget my rapt astonishment the day I first numbered\r\nthe dust in the lecture-room of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, with his\r\ninstrument and under his direction.\r\n\r\nThis wonderfully ingenious instrument was devised on this principle, that\r\nevery fog-particle has entombed in it an invisible dust-particle. A\r\ndefinite small quantity of common air is diluted with a fixed large\r\nquantity of dustless air (_i.e._ air that has been filtered through\r\ncotton-wool). The mixture is allowed to be saturated with water-vapour.\r\nThen the few particles of dust seize the moisture, become visible in fine\r\ndrops, fall on a divided plate, and are there counted by means of a\r\nmagnifying glass. That is the secret!\r\n\r\nI shall now give you a general idea of the apparatus. Into a common glass\r\nflask of carafe shape, and flat-bottomed, of 30 cubic inches capacity, are\r\npassed two small tubes, at the end of one of which is attached a small\r\nsquare silver table, 1 inch in length. A little water having been\r\ninserted, the flask is inverted, and the table is placed exactly 1 inch\r\nfrom the inverted bottom, so that the contents of air right above the\r\ntable are 1 cubic inch. This observing table is divided into 100 equal\r\nsquares, and is highly polished, with the burnishing all in one direction,\r\nso that during the observations it appears dark, when the fine\r\nmist-particles glisten opal-like with the reflected light in order that\r\nthey may be more easily counted. The tube to which the silver table is\r\nattached is connected with two stop-cocks, one of which can admit a small\r\nmeasured portion of the air to be examined. The other tube in the flask is\r\nconnected with an air-pump of 10 cubic inches capacity. Over the flask is\r\nplaced a covering, coloured black in the inside. In the top of this cover\r\nis inserted a powerful magnifying glass, through which the particles on\r\nthe silver table can be easily counted. A little to the side of this\r\nmagnifier is an opening in the cover, through which light is concentrated\r\non the table.\r\n\r\nTo perform the experiment, the air in the flask is exhausted by the\r\nair-pump. The flask is then filled with filtered air. One-tenth of a cubic\r\ninch of the air to be examined is then introduced into the flask, and\r\nmixed with the 30 cubic inches of dustless air. After one stroke of the\r\nair-pump, this mixed air is made to occupy an additional space of 10 cubic\r\ninches; and this rarefying of the air so chills it that condensation of\r\nthe water-vapour takes place on the dust-particles. The observer, looking\r\nthrough the magnifying-glass upon the silver table, sees the\r\nmist-particles fall like an opal shower on the table. He counts the number\r\non a single square in two or three places, striking an average in his\r\nmind. Suppose the average number upon a single square were five, then on\r\nthe whole table there would be 500; and these 500 particles of dust are\r\nthose which floated invisibly in the cubic inch of mixed air right above\r\nthe table. But, as there are 40 cubic inches of mixed air in the flask and\r\nbarrel, the number of dust-particles in the whole is 20,000. That is,\r\nthere are 20,000 dust-particles in the same quantity of common air\r\n(one-tenth of a cubic inch) which was introduced for examination. In other\r\nwords, a cubic inch of the air contained 200,000 dust-particles--nearly a\r\nquarter of a million.\r\n\r\nThe day I used the instrument we counted 4,000,000 of dust-particles in a\r\ncubic inch of the air outside of the room, due to the quantity of smoke\r\nfrom the passing trains. Dr. Aitken has counted in 1 cubic inch of air\r\nimmediately above a Bunsen flame the fabulous number of 489,000,000 of\r\ndust-particles.\r\n\r\nA small instrument has been constructed which can bring about results\r\nsufficiently accurate for ordinary purposes. It is so constructed that,\r\nwhen the different parts are unscrewed, they fit into a case 4-1/2 inches\r\nby 2-1/2 by 1-1/4 deep--about the size of an ordinary cigar-case.\r\n\r\nAfter knowing this, we are apt to wonder why our lungs do not get clogged\r\nup with the enormous number of dust-particles. In ordinary breathing, 30\r\ncubic inches of air pass in and out at every breath, and adults breathe\r\nabout fifteen times every minute. But the warm lung-surface repels the\r\ncolder dust-particles, and the continuous evaporation of moisture from the\r\nsurface of the air-tubes prevents the dust from alighting or clinging to\r\nthe surface at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDUST AND ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Aitken has devoted a vast amount of attention to the enumeration of\r\ndust-particles in the air, on the Continent as well as in Scotland, to\r\ndetermine the effects of their variation in number.\r\n\r\nOn his first visit to Hyeres, in 1890, he counted with the instrument\r\n12,000 dust-particles in a cubic inch of the air: whereas in the following\r\nyear he counted 250,000. He observed, however, that where there was least\r\ndust, the air was very clear; whereas with the maximum of dust, there was\r\na very thick haze.\r\n\r\nAt Mentone, the corresponding number was 13,000, when the wind was blowing\r\nfrom the mountains; but increased to 430,000, when the wind was blowing\r\nfrom the populous town.\r\n\r\nOn his first visit to the Rigi Kulm, in Switzerland, the air was\r\nremarkably clear and brilliant, and the corresponding number never\r\nexceeded 33,000; but, on his second visit, he counted no less than\r\n166,000. This was accounted for by a thick haze, which rendered the lower\r\nAlps scarcely visible. The upper limit of the haze was well defined; and\r\nthough the sky was cloudless, the sun looked like a harvest moon, and\r\nrequired no eagle's eye to keep fixed on it.\r\n\r\nNext day there was a violent thunder-storm. At 6 P.M. the storm commenced,\r\nand 60,000 dust-particles to the cubic inch of air were registered; but in\r\nthe middle of the storm he counted only 13,000. There was a heavy fall of\r\nhail at this time, and he accounts for the diminution of dust-particles by\r\nthe down-rush of purer upper air, which displaced the contaminated lower\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAt the Lake of Lucerne there was an exceptional diminution of the number\r\nin the course of an hour, viz. from 171,000 to 28,000 in a cubic inch. On\r\nlooking about, he found that the direction of the wind had changed,\r\nbringing down the purer upper air to the place of observation. The bending\r\ndownwards of the trees by the strong wind showed that it was coming from\r\nthe upper air.\r\n\r\nReturning to Scotland, he continued his observations at Ben Nevis and at\r\nKingairloch, opposite Appin, Mr. Rankin using the instrument at the top of\r\nthe mountain. These observations showed in general that on the mountain\r\nsoutherly, south-easterly, and easterly winds were more impregnated with\r\ndust-particles, sometimes containing 133,000 per cubic inch. Northerly\r\nwinds brought pure air. The observations at sea-level showed a certain\r\nparallelism to those on the summit of the mountain. With a north-westerly\r\nwind the dust-particles reached the low number of 300 per cubic inch, the\r\nlowest recorded at any low-level station.\r\n\r\nThe general deductions which he made from his numerous observations during\r\nthese two years are that (1) air coming from inhabited districts is always\r\nimpure; (2) dust is carried by the wind to enormous distances; (3) dust\r\nrises to the tops of mountains during the day; (4) with much dust there is\r\nmuch haze; (5) high humidity causes great thickness of the atmosphere, if\r\naccompanied by a great amount of dust, whereas there is no evidence that\r\nhumidity alone has any effect in producing thickness; (6) and there is\r\ngenerally a high amount of dust with high temperature, and a low amount of\r\ndust with low temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA FOG-COUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the enumeration of the dust-particles in the atmosphere is the\r\nmarvellous accuracy of counting the number of particles in a fog. The same\r\ningenious inventor has constructed a fog-counter for the purpose; and the\r\nnumber of fog-particles in a cubic inch can be ascertained. This\r\ninstrument consists of a glass micrometer divided into squares of a known\r\nsize, and a strong microscope for observing the drops on the stage. The\r\nspace between the micrometer and the microscope is open, so that the air\r\npasses freely over the stage; and the drops that fall on its surface are\r\neasily seen. These drops are very small; many of them when spread on the\r\nglass are no more than the five-hundredth of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn observing these drops, the attention requires to be confined to a\r\nlimited area of the stage, as many of the drops rapidly evaporate, some\r\nalmost as soon as they touch the glass, whilst the large ones remain a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nIn one set of Dr. Aitken's observations, in February 1891, the fog was so\r\nthick that objects beyond a hundred yards were quite invisible. The number\r\nof drops falling per second varied greatly from time to time. The greatest\r\nnumber was 323 drops per square inch in one second. The high number never\r\nlasted for long, and in the intervals the number fell as low as 32, or to\r\none-tenth.\r\n\r\nIf we knew the size of these drops, we might be able to calculate the\r\nvelocity of their fall, and from that obtain the number in a cubic inch.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious addition is put to the instrument in order to ascertain this\r\ndirectly. It is constructed so as to ascertain the number of particles\r\nthat fall from a known height. Under a low-power microscope, and\r\nconcentric with it, is mounted a tube 2 inches long and 1-1/2 inch in\r\ndiameter, with a bottom and a cover, which are fixed to an axis parallel\r\nwith the axis of the tube, so that, by turning a handle, these can be slid\r\nsideways, closing or opening the tube at both ends when required. In the\r\ntop is a small opening, corresponding to the lens of the microscope, and\r\nin the centre of the bottom is placed the observing-stage illumined by a\r\nspot-mirror. The handle is turned, and the ends are open to admit the\r\nfoggy air. The handle is quickly reversed, and the ends are closed,\r\nenabling the observer to count on the stage all the fog-particles in the\r\ntwo inches of air over it.\r\n\r\nThe number of dust-particles in the air which become centres of\r\ncondensation depends on the rate at which the condensation is taking\r\nplace. The most recent observations show that quick condensation causes a\r\nlarge number of particles to become active, whereas slow condensation\r\ncauses a small number. After the condensation has ceased, a process of\r\ndifferentiation takes place, the larger particles robbing the smaller ones\r\nof their moisture, owing to the vapour-pressure at the surface of the\r\ndrops of large curvature being less than at the surface of drops of\r\nsmaller curvature.\r\n\r\nBy this process the particles in a cloud are reduced in number; the\r\nremaining ones, becoming larger, fall quicker. The cloud thus becomes\r\nthinner for a time. A strong wind, suddenly arising, will cause the\r\ncloud-particles to be rapidly formed: these will be very numerous, but\r\nvery small--so small that they are just visible with great care under a\r\nstrong magnifying lens used in the instrument. But in slowly formed clouds\r\nthe particles are larger, and therefore more easily visible to the naked\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThough the particles in a fog are slightly finer, the number is about the\r\nsame as in a cloud--that is, generally. As clouds vary in density, the\r\nnumber of particles varies. Sometimes in a cloud one cannot see farther\r\nthan 30 yards; whereas in a few minutes it clears up a little, so that we\r\ncan see 100 yards. Of course, the denser the cloud the greater the number\r\nof water-particles falling on the calculating-stage of the instrument.\r\n\r\nVery heavy falls of cloud-particles seldom last more than a few seconds,\r\nthe average being about 325 on the square inch per second, the maximum\r\nreaching to 1290. This is about four times the number counted in a fog.\r\nYet the particles are so very small that they evaporate instantly when\r\nthey reach a slight increase of temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our ordinary atmosphere there can be no clouds without dust. A\r\ndust-particle is the nucleus that at a certain humidity becomes the centre\r\nof condensation of the water-vapour so as to form a cloud-particle; and a\r\ncollection of these forms a cloud.\r\n\r\nThis condensation of vapour round a number of dust-particles in visible\r\nform gives rise to a vast variety of cloud-shapes. There are two distinct\r\nways in which the formation of clouds generally takes place. Either a\r\nlayer of air is cooled in a body below the dew-point; or a mass of warm\r\nand moist air rises into a mass which is cold and dry. The first forms a\r\ncloud, called, from being a layer, _stratus_; the second forms a cloud,\r\ncalled, from its heap appearance, _cumulus_. The first is widely extended\r\nand horizontal, averaging 1800 feet in height; the second is convex or\r\nconical, like the head of a sheaf, increasing upward from a level base,\r\naveraging from 4500 feet to 6000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nThere are endless combinations of these two; but at the height of 27,000\r\nfeet, where the cloud-particles are frozen, the structure of the cloud is\r\nfiner, like \"mares' tails,\" receiving the name _cirrus_. When the cirrus\r\nand cumulus are combined, in well-defined roundish masses, what is\r\nfamiliarly described as a \"mackerel sky\" is beautifully presented. The\r\ndark mass of cloud, called _nimbus_, is the threatening rain-cloud, about\r\n4500 feet in height.\r\n\r\nAt the International Meteorological Conference at Munich, in 1892, twelve\r\nvarieties of clouds were classified, but those named above are the\r\nprincipal. In a beautiful sunset one can sometimes notice two or three\r\ndistances of clouds, the sun shedding its gold light on the full front of\r\none set, and only fringing with vivid light the nearer range.\r\n\r\nAlthough no man has wrought so hard as Dr. Aitken to establish the\r\nprinciple that clouds are mainly due to the existence of dust-particles\r\nwhich attract moisture on certain conditions, yet even twenty years ago he\r\nsaid that it was probable that sunshine might cause the formation of\r\nnuclei and allow cloudy condensation to take place where there was no\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions the sun gives rise to a great increase in the\r\nnumber of nuclei. Accordingly, he has carefully tested a few of the\r\nordinary constituents and impurities in our atmosphere to see if sunshine\r\nacted on them in such a way as to make them probable formers of\r\ncloud-particles.\r\n\r\nHe tested various gases, with more or less success. He found that ordinary\r\nair, after being deprived of its dust-particles and exposed to sunshine,\r\ndoes not show any cloudy condensation on expansion; but, when certain\r\ngases are in the dustless air, a very different result is obtained.\r\n\r\nHe first used ammonia, putting one drop into six cubic inches of water in\r\na flask, and sunning this for one minute; the result was a considerable\r\nquantity of condensation, even with such a weak solution. When the flask\r\nwas exposed for five minutes, the condensation by the action of the\r\nsunshine was made more dense.\r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide was tested in the same way, and it was found to be a\r\npowerful generator of nuclei. Curious is it that sulphurous acid is\r\npuzzling to the experimentalist for cloud formation. It gives rise to\r\ncondensation in the dark; but sunshine very conclusively increases the\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nChlorine causes condensation to take place without supersaturation;\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen (which one always associates with the smell of\r\nrotten eggs) gives dense condensation after being exposed to sunshine.\r\n\r\nThough the most of these nuclei, due to the action of sunshine in the\r\ngases, remain active for cloudy condensation for a comparatively short\r\nspace of time--fifteen minutes to half-an-hour--yet the experiments show\r\nthat it is possible for the cloudy condensation to take place in certain\r\ncircumstances in the absence of dust. This seems paradoxical in the light\r\nof the former beautiful experiments; but, in ordinary circumstances, dust\r\nis needed for the formation of clouds. However, supposing there is any\r\npart of the upper air free from dust, it is now found possible, when any\r\nof these gases experimented on be present, for the sun to convert them\r\ninto nuclei of condensation, and permit of clouds being formed in dustless\r\nair, miles above the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the lower atmosphere there are always plenty of dust-particles to form\r\ncloudy condensation, whether the sun shines or not. These are produced by\r\nthe waste from the millions of meteors that daily fall into the air.\r\n\r\nBut in the higher atmosphere, clouds can be formed by the action of the\r\nsun's rays on certain gases. This is a great boon to us on the earth; for\r\nit assures us of clouds being ever existing to defend us from the sun's\r\nextra-powerful rays, even when our atmosphere is fairly clear. This is\r\nsurely of some meteorological importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDECAY OF CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages clouds have attracted the attention of observers.\r\nVaried are their forms and colours, yet in our atmosphere there is one law\r\nin their formation. Cloud-particles are formed by the condensation of\r\nwater-vapour on the dust-particles invisibly floating in the atmosphere,\r\nup to thousands--and even millions--in the cubic inch of air.\r\n\r\nBut observers have not directed their attention so much to the decay of\r\nclouds--in fact, the subject is quite new. And yet how suggestive is the\r\nsubject!\r\n\r\nThe process of decay in clouds takes place in various ways. A careful\r\nobserver may witness the gradual wasting away and dilution into thin air\r\nof even great stretches of cloud, when circumstances are favourable. In\r\nMay 1896 my attention was particularly drawn to this at my manse in\r\nStrathmore. In the middle of that exceptionally sultry month, I was\r\narrested by a remarkable transformation scene. It was the hottest May for\r\nseventy-two years, and the driest for twenty-five years. The whole parched\r\nearth was thirsting for rain. All the morning my eyes were turned to the\r\nclouds in the hope that the much-desired shower should fall. Till ten\r\no'clock the sun was not seen, and there was no blue in the sky. Nor was\r\nthere any haze or fog.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the sun shone through a thinner portion of the enveloping\r\nclouds, and, to the north, the sky began to open. As if by some magic\r\nspell there was, in a quarter of an hour, more blue to be seen than\r\nclouds. At the same time, near the horizon, a haze was forming, gradually\r\nbecoming denser as time wore on. In an hour the whole clouds were gone,\r\nand the glorious orb of day dispelled the moisture to its thin-air form.\r\n\r\nThis was a pointed and rapid illustration of the decay from cloud-form to\r\nhaze, and then to the pure vapoury sky. It was an instance of the\r\n_reverse_ process. As the sun cleared through, the temperature in the\r\ncloud-land rose and evaporation took place on the surface of the\r\ncloud-particles, until by an untraceable, but still a gradual process\r\nthrough fog, the haze was formed. Even then the heat was too great for a\r\ndefinite haze, and the water-vapour returned to the air, leaving the\r\ndust-particles in invisible suspension.\r\n\r\nBut clouds decay in another way. This I will illustrate in the next\r\nchapter on \"It always rains.\"\r\n\r\nWhat strikes a close observer is the difference of structure in clouds\r\nwhich are in the process of formation and those which are in the process\r\nof decay. In the former the water-particles are much smaller and far more\r\nnumerous than in the latter. While the particles in clouds in decay are\r\nlarge enough to be seen with the unaided eye, when they fall on a properly\r\nlighted measuring table, they are so small in clouds in rapid formation\r\nthat the particles cannot be seen without the aid of a strong magnifying\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nObservers have assumed that the whole explanation of the fantastic shapes\r\ntaken by clouds is founded on the process of formation; but Dr. Aitken has\r\npointed out that ripple-marked clouds, for instance, have been clouds of\r\ndecay. When what is called a cirro-stratus cloud--mackerel-like against\r\nthe blue sky--is carefully observed in fine weather, it will be found that\r\nit frequently changes the ripple-marked cirrus in the process of decay to\r\nvanishing. Where the cloud is thin enough to be broken through by the\r\nclear air that is drawn in between the eddies, the ripple markings get\r\nnearer and nearer the centre, as the cloud decays. And, at last, when\r\nnearly dissolved, these markings are extended quite across the cloud.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, we consider the cases of clouds gradually melting away back\r\ninto their original state of blue water-vapour, or the constant fine\r\nraining from clouds and re-formation by evaporation, or the transformation\r\nof such clouds as the cirro-stratus into the ripple-marked cirrus, we are\r\nforced to the conclusion that in clouds there is not always development,\r\nbut sometimes degeneration; not always formation, but sometimes decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nIT ALWAYS RAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll are familiar with the answer given by the native of Skye to the irate\r\ntourist on that island, who, for the sixth day drenched, asked the\r\nquestion: \"Does it always rain here?\" \"Na!\" answered the workman, without\r\nat all understanding the joke; \"feiles it snaas\" (sometimes it snows).\r\nYet, strange to say, the tourist's question has been answered in the\r\naffirmative in every place where a cloud is overhead, visible or\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nWhenever a cloud is formed, it begins to rain; and the drops shower down\r\nin immense numbers, though most minute in size--\"the playful fancies of\r\nthe mighty sky.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is only in certain circumstances that these drops are\r\nattracted together so as to form large drops, which fall to the earth in\r\ngenial showers to refresh the thirsty soil, or in a terrible deluge to\r\ncause great destruction. But when the temperature and pressure are not\r\nsuitable for the formation of what we commonly know as the rain, the fine\r\ndrops fall into the air under the cloud, where they immediately evaporate\r\nfrom their dust free-surfaces, if the air is dry and warm. This is, in\r\nother words, the decay of clouds.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that objects in a fog may not be wetted, when the\r\nnumber of water-particles is great. It seems that these water-particles\r\nall evaporate so quickly that even one's hand or face is not sensible of\r\nbeing wetted. The particles are minutely small; and they may evaporate\r\neven before reaching the warm skin, by reason of the heated air over the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarly warm sensation in the centre of a cumulus cloud,\r\nespecially when it is not dense. A glow of heat seems to radiate from all\r\npoints. Yet the face and hands are quite dry, and exposed objects are not\r\nwetted; but it is really _always raining_. That is a curious discovery.\r\n\r\nIt is radiant heat that is the cause of the remarkable result. The rays of\r\nthe sun, which strike the upper part of the cloud, not only heat that\r\nsurface but also penetrate the cloud and fall on the surface of bodies\r\nwithin, generating heat there. These heated surfaces again radiate heat\r\ninto the air attached to them. This warm air receives the fine raindrops\r\nin the cloud, and dissolves the moisture from the dust-particles before\r\nthe moisture can reach the surfaces exposed. That a vast amount of radiant\r\nheat rushes through a cloud is clearly shown by exposing a thermometer\r\nwith black bulb _in vacuo_. On some occasions, a thermometer would\r\nindicate from 40 deg. to 50 deg. above the temperature of the air, thus proving\r\nthe surface to be quite dry.\r\n\r\nThese observations have been corroborated on Mount Pilatus, near\r\nLucerne--1000 feet higher and more isolated than the Rigi. The summit was\r\nquite enveloped in cloud, and, though one might naturally conclude that\r\nthe air was dense with moisture, yet the wooden seats, walls, and all\r\nexposed surfaces were quite dry. Strange to say, however, the thermometers\r\nhung up got wet rapidly, and the pins driven into the wooden post to\r\nsupport them rapidly became moist. A thermometer lying on a wooden seat\r\nstood at 60 deg., while one hung up read only 48 deg. This difference was caused\r\nby radiant heat.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that, when bodies are exposed to radiant heat, they are\r\nheated in proportion to their size; the smaller, then, may be moist, when\r\nthe larger are dry by radiation. The effect of the sun's penetrating heat\r\nthrough the cloud is to heat exposed objects above the temperature of the\r\nair; and if the objects are of any size they are considerably heated, and\r\nretain their heat more, while at the same time around them is a layer of\r\nwarm air which is quite sufficient to force the water-vapour to leave the\r\ndust-particles in the fine rain.\r\n\r\nHence seats, walls, posts, &c., are quite dry, though they are in the\r\nmiddle of a cloud. They are large enough to throw off the moisture by the\r\nretained heat, or by the large amount of surrounding heat; whereas, small\r\nbodies, which are not heated to the same degree and cannot therefore\r\nretain their heat so easily, have not heat-power sufficient to withstand\r\nthe moisture, and they become wetted. Hence, by the radiant heat, the\r\nlarge exposed objects are dry in the cloud; whereas small objects are\r\ndamp, and, in some cases, dripping with wet.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, then, that whenever a cloud overhangs, _rain is falling_,\r\nthough it may not reach the earth on account of the dryness of the stratum\r\nof air below the cloud, and the heat of the air over the earth. So that on\r\na summer day, with the gold-fringed, fleecy clouds sailing overhead, it is\r\nreally raining; but the drops, being very small, evaporate long before\r\nreaching the earth. As Ariel sings at the end of \"The Tempest\" of\r\nShakespeare, \"The rain, it raineth every day.\" It rains, but much of the\r\nmelting of the clouds is reproduced by a wonderful circularity--the\r\nmoisture evaporating, seizing other dust-particles, forming\r\ncloud-particles, falling again, and so on _ad infinitum_, during the\r\nexisting circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHAZE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is haze? The dictionary says, \"a fog.\" Well, haze is _not_ a fog. In\r\na fog, the dust-particles in the air have been fully clothed with\r\nwater-vapour; in a haze, the process of condensation has been arrested.\r\n\r\nCloudy condensation is changed to haze by the reduction of its humidity.\r\nDr. Aitken invented a simple apparatus for testing the condensing power of\r\ndust, and observing if water-vapour condensed on the deposited dust in\r\nunsaturated air.\r\n\r\nThe dust from the air has first to be collected. This is done by placing a\r\nglass plate vertically, and in close contact with one of the panes of\r\nglass in the window, by means of a little india-rubber solution. The plate\r\nbeing thus rendered colder than the air in the room, the dust is deposited\r\non it.\r\n\r\nConstruct a rectangular box, with a square bottom, 1-1/2 inches a side and\r\n3/4 inch deep, and open at the top. Cover the top edge of the box with a\r\nthickness of india-rubber. Place the dusty plate--a square glass mirror, 4\r\ninches a side--on the top of the india-rubber, and hold it down by spring\r\ncatches, so as to make the box water-tight. The box has been provided with\r\ntwo pipes, one for taking in water and the other for taking away the\r\noverflow, with the bulb of a thermometer in the centre. Clean the dust\r\ncarefully off one half of the mirror, so that one half of the glass\r\ncovering the box is clean and the other half dusty. Pour cold water\r\nthrough the pipe into the box, so as to lower the temperature of the\r\nmirror, and carefully observe when condensation begins on the clean part\r\nand on the dusty part, taking a note of the difference of temperature. The\r\ncondensation of the water-vapour will appear on the dust-particles before\r\ncoming down to the natural dew-point temperature of the clean glass. And\r\nthe difference between the two temperatures indicates the temperature\r\nabove the dew-point at which the dust has condensed the water-vapour.\r\n\r\nMagnesia dust has small affinity for water-vapour; accordingly, it\r\ncondenses at almost exactly the same temperature as the glass. But\r\ngunpowder has great condensing power. All have noticed that the smoke\r\nfrom exploded gunpowder is far more dense in damp than in dry weather. In\r\nthe experiment it will be found that the dust from gunpowder smoke begins\r\nto show signs of condensing the vapour at a temperature of 9 deg. Fahr. above\r\nthe dew-point. In the case of sodium dust, the vapour is condensed from\r\nthe air at a temperature of 30 deg. above the dew-point.\r\n\r\nDust collected in a smoking-room shows a decidedly greater condensing\r\npower than that from the outer air.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand why the glass in picture frames and other places\r\nsometimes appears damp when the air is not saturated. When in winter the\r\nwindows are not often cleaned, a damp deposit may be frequently seen on\r\nthe glass. Any one can try the experiment. Clean one half of a dusty pane\r\nof glass in cold weather, and the clean part will remain undewed and\r\nclear, while the dusty part is damp to the eye and greasy to the touch.\r\n\r\nThese observations indicate that moisture is deposited on the\r\ndust-particles from air, which is not saturated, and that the condensation\r\ntakes place while the air is comparatively dry, _before_ the temperature\r\nis lowered to the dew-point. There is, then, no definite demarcation\r\nbetween what seems to us clear air and thick haze. The clearest air has\r\nsome haze, and, as the humidity increases, the thickness of the air\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nIn all haze the temperature is above the dew-point. The dust-particles\r\nhave only condensed a very small amount of the moisture so as to form\r\nhaze, before the fuller condensation takes place at the dew-point.\r\n\r\nAt the Italian lakes, on many occasions when the air is damp and still,\r\nevery stage of condensation may be observed in close proximity, not\r\nseparated by a hard and fast line, but when no one could determine where\r\nthe clear air ended and the cloud began. Sometimes in the sky overhead a\r\ngradual change can be observed from perfect clearness to thick air, and\r\nthen the cloud.\r\n\r\nA thick haze may be occasioned by an increased number of dust-particles\r\nwith little moisture, or of a diminished number of dust-particles with\r\nmuch moisture, above the point of saturation. The haze is cleared by this\r\ntemperature rising, so as to allow the moisture to evaporate from the\r\ndust-particles.\r\n\r\nWhenever the air is dry and hazy, much dust is found in it; as the dust\r\ndecreases the haze also decreases. For example, Dr. Aitken, at\r\nKingairloch, in one of the clearest districts of Argyleshire, on a clear\r\nJuly afternoon, counted 4000 dust-particles in a cubic inch of the air;\r\nwhereas, two days before, in thick haze, he counted no fewer than 64,000\r\nin the cubic inch. At Dumfries the number counted on a very hazy day in\r\nOctober increased twenty-fold over the number counted the day before, when\r\nit was clear.\r\n\r\nAll know that thick haze is usual in very sultry weather. The wavy,\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp ripples near the horizon indicate its presence very\r\nplainly. During the intense heat there is generally much dust in the\r\natmosphere; this dust, by the high temperature, attracts moisture from the\r\napparently dry air, though above the saturation point. In all\r\ncircumstances, then, the haze can be accounted for by the condensing power\r\nof the dust-particles in the atmosphere, at a higher temperature than that\r\nrequired for the formation of fogs, or mists, or rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHAZING EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC DUST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transparency of the atmosphere is very much destroyed by the\r\nimpurities communicated to it while passing over the inhabited areas of\r\nthe country. Dr. Aitken devoted eighteen months to compare the amount of\r\ndusty impurities in different masses of air, or of different airs brought\r\nin by winds from different directions.\r\n\r\nHe took Falkirk for his centre of observations. This town lies a little to\r\nthe north of a line drawn between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and is nearly\r\nmidway between them. If we draw a line due west from it, and another due\r\nnorth, we find that, in the north-west quadrant so enclosed, the\r\npopulation of that part of Scotland is extremely thin, the country over\r\nthat area being chiefly mountainous. In all other directions, the\r\nconditions are quite different. In the north-east quadrant are the fairly\r\nwell-populated areas of Aberdeenshire, Forfarshire, and the thickly\r\npopulated county of Fife. In the south-east quadrant are situated\r\nEdinburgh and the well-populated districts of the south-east of Scotland.\r\nAnd in the south-west quadrant are Glasgow and the large manufacturing\r\ntowns which surround it. The winds from three of these quadrants bring air\r\npolluted in its passage over populated areas, whereas the winds from the\r\nnorth-west come comparatively pure.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of estimating the amount of haze is to note the most\r\ndistant hill that can be seen through the haze. The distance in miles of\r\nthe farthest away hill visible is then called \"the limit of visibility\" of\r\nthe air at the time. For the observations made at Falkirk, only three\r\nhills are available, one about four miles distant, the Ochils about\r\nfifteen miles distant, and Ben Ledi about twenty-five miles distant--all\r\nin the north-west quadrant. When the air is thick, only the near hill can\r\nbe seen; then the Ochils become visible as the air clears; and at last Ben\r\nLedi is seen, when the haze becomes still less. After Ben Ledi is visible,\r\nit then becomes necessary to estimate the amount of haze on it, in order\r\nto get the limit of visibility of the air at the time. Thus, if Ben Ledi\r\nbe half-hazed, then the limit of visibility will be fifty miles. In this\r\nway all the estimates of haze have been reduced to one scale for\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nAs the result of all the observations it was found that, as the dryness of\r\nthe air increases, the limit of visibility also increases. A very marked\r\ndifference in the transparency of the air was found with winds from the\r\ndifferent directions. In the north-west quadrant the winds made the air\r\nvery clear, whereas winds from all other directions made the air very much\r\nhazed. The winds in the other three areas are nearly ten times more hazed\r\nthan those from the north-west quadrant. That is very striking.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion come to is that the air from densely inhabited districts is\r\nso polluted that it is fully nine times more hazed than the air that comes\r\nfrom the thinly inhabited districts; in other words, the atmosphere at\r\nFalkirk is about ten times thicker when the wind is east or south than it\r\nwould be if there were no fires and no inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that the limit varies considerably for the\r\nsame wind at the same humidity. This is what might have been expected,\r\nbecause from the observations made by the dust-counter the number of\r\nparticles varied greatly in winds from the same directions, but at\r\ndifferent times. This depends upon the rise and fall of the wind, changes\r\nin the state of trade, season of the year, and other causes. During a\r\nstrike, the dearth of coal will make a considerable diminution in the\r\nnumber of dust-particles in the air of large towns. With a north wind, the\r\nextreme limits of visibility are 120 to 200 miles; and with a north-west\r\nwind, from 70 to 250 miles. An east wind has as limits 4 to 50 miles, and\r\na south-east wind 2 to 60 miles.\r\n\r\nOne interesting fact to be noticed, after wading through these tables, is\r\nthis--that, as a general result, the transparency of the air increases\r\nabout 3.7 times for any increase in dryness from 2 deg. to 8 deg. of wet-bulb\r\ndepression. That is, the clearness of the air is inversely proportional to\r\nthe relative humidity; or, put another way, if the air is four times drier\r\nit is about four times clearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHUNDER CLEARS THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"thunder clears the air\" is familiar to all. It contains a very\r\nvital truth, yet even scientific men did not know its full meaning until\r\njust the other day. It came by experience to people who had been for ages\r\nobserving the weather; and it is one of the most pointed of the\r\n\"weather-lore\" expressions. Folks got to know, by a sort of rule-of-thumb,\r\ntruths which scientifically they were unable to learn. And this is one.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, therefore, we should respect a little more what is called\r\n\"folk-lore,\" or ordinary people's sayings. Experience has taught men many\r\nwonderful things. In olden times they were keener natural observers. They\r\nhad few books, but they had plenty of time. They studied the habits of\r\nanimals and moods of nature, and they came wonderfully near to reaching\r\nthe full truth, though they could not give a reason for it. The\r\nawe-inspiring in nature has especially riveted the attention of man.\r\n\r\nAnd no appearance in nature joins more powerfully the elements of grandeur\r\nand awe than a heavy thunder-storm. When, suddenly, from the breast of a\r\ndark thunder-cloud a brilliant flash of light darts zigzag to the earth,\r\nfollowed by a loud crackling noise which softens in the distance into\r\nweaker volumes of sound, terror seizes the birds of the air and the cattle\r\nin the field. The man who is born to rule the storm rejoices in the\r\npowerful display; but kings have trembled at the sight.\r\n\r\nByron thus pictures a storm in the Alps:--\r\n\r\n                              \"Far along\r\n    From peak to peak, the rattling crags among\r\n  Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,\r\n    But every mountain now hath found a tongue,\r\n  And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,\r\n  Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!\"\r\n\r\nFranklin found that lightning is just a kind of electricity. No one can\r\ntell how it is produced; yet a flash has been photographed. When the flash\r\nis from one cloud to another there is sheet-lightning, which is beautiful\r\nbut not dangerous; but, when the electricity passes from a cloud to the\r\nearth in a forked form, it is very dangerous indeed. The flash is\r\ninstantaneous, but the sound of the thunder takes some time to travel.\r\nRoughly speaking, the sound takes five seconds or six beats of the pulse\r\nto the mile.\r\n\r\nAll are now taught at school that it is the oxygen in the air which is\r\nnecessary to keep us in life. If mice are put into a glass jar of pure\r\noxygen gas, they will at once dance with exhilarating joy. It occurred to\r\nSir Benjamin Richardson, some time ago, that it would be interesting to\r\ncontinue some experiments with animals and oxygen. He put a number of mice\r\ninto a jar of pure oxygen for a time; they breathed in the gas, and\r\nbreathed out water-vapour and carbonic acid. After the mice had continued\r\nthis for some time, he removed them by an arrangement. By chemical means\r\nhe removed the water-vapour and carbonic acid from the mixed air in the\r\nvessel. When a blown-out taper was inserted, it at once burst into flame,\r\nshowing that the remaining gas was oxygen.\r\n\r\nAgain, the mice were put into this vessel to breathe away. But, strange to\r\nsay, the animals soon became drowsy; the smartness of the oxygen was gone.\r\nAt last they died; there was nothing in the gas to keep them in life; yet,\r\nby the ordinary chemical tests, it was still oxygen. It had repeatedly\r\npassed through the lungs of the mice, and during this passage there had\r\nbeen an action in the air-cells which absorbed the life-giving element of\r\nthe gas. It is oxygen, so far as chemistry is concerned, but it has no\r\nlife-giving power. It has been _devitalised_.\r\n\r\nBut the startling discovery still remains. Sir Benjamin had previously\r\nfitted up the vessel with two short wires, opposite each other in the\r\nsides--part outside and part inside. Two wires are fastened to the outside\r\nknobs. These wires are attached to an electric machine, and a flash of\r\nelectricity is made to pass between the inner points of the vessel. The\r\nwires are again removed; nothing strange is seen in the vessel. But, when\r\nliving mice are put into the vessel, they dance as joyfully as if pure\r\noxygen were in it. The oxygen in which the first mice died has now been\r\nquite refreshed by the electricity. The bad air has been cleared and made\r\nlife-supporting by the electric discharge. It has been again vitalised.\r\n\r\nNow, to apply this: before a thunder-storm, everything has been so still\r\nfor days that the oxygen in the air has been to some extent robbed of its\r\nlife-sustaining power. The air feels \"close,\" a feeling of drowsiness\r\ncomes over all. But, after the air has been pierced by several flashes of\r\nlightning, the life-force in the air is restored. Your spirits revive; you\r\nfeel restored; your breathing is far freer; your drowsiness is gone. Then\r\nthere is a burst of heavenly music from the exhilarated birds. Thus a\r\nthunder-storm \"clears the air.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of lightning through the air ozone is produced--the gas\r\nthat is produced after a flash of electricity. It is a kind of oxygen,\r\nwith fine exciting effects on the body. If, then, the life-sustaining\r\npower of oxygen depends on a trace of ozone, and this is being made by\r\nlightning's work, how pleased should we be at the occasional\r\nthunder-storm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDISEASE-GERMS IN THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gay motes that dance in the sunbeams are not all harmless. All are\r\nannoying to the tidy housekeeper; but some are dangerous. There are living\r\nparticles that float in the air as the messengers of disease and death.\r\nSome, falling on fresh wounds, find there a suitable feeding-place; and,\r\nif not destroyed, generate the deadly influence. Others are drawn in with\r\nthe breath; and, unless the lungs can withstand them, they seize hold and\r\nspread some sickness or disease. From stagnant pools, common sewers, and\r\nfilthy rooms, disease-germs are constantly contaminating the air. Yet\r\nthese can be counted.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method is that of Professor Frankland. It depends on this\r\nprinciple: a certain quantity of air is drawn through some cotton-wool;\r\nthis wool seizes the organisms as the air passes through; these organisms\r\nare afterwards allowed to feed upon a suitable nutritive medium until they\r\nreach maturity; they are then counted easily.\r\n\r\nAbout an inch from each end of a glass tube (5 inches long and 1 inch\r\nbore), the glass is pressed in during the process of blowing. Some\r\ncotton-wool is squeezed in to form a plug at the farther constricted part\r\nof the glass. The important plug is now inserted at the same open end, but\r\nis not allowed to go beyond the constricted part at its end. A piece of\r\nlong lead tubing is attached to the former end by an india-rubber tube.\r\nThe other end of the lead tubing is connected with an exhausting syringe.\r\nSixty strokes of the 18 cubic inches syringe will draw 1080 cubic inches\r\nof the air to be examined through the plugs, the first retaining the\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nThe impregnated plug is then put into a flask containing in solution some\r\ngelatine-peptone. The flask is made to revolve horizontally until an\r\nalmost perfectly even film of gelatine and the organisms from the\r\nbroken-up plug cover its inner surface.\r\n\r\nThe flask is allowed to remain for an hour in a cool place, and is then\r\nplaced under a bell-jar, at a temperature of 70 deg. Fahr. There it remains,\r\nto allow the germs to incubate, for four or five days. The surface of the\r\nflask having been previously divided into equal parts by ink lines, the\r\ncounting is now commenced. If the average be taken for each segment, the\r\nnumber of the whole is easily ascertained. A simple arithmetical\r\ncalculation then determines the number of organisms in a cubic foot, since\r\nthe number is known for the 1080 cubic inches. That is the process for\r\ndetermining the number of living organisms in a fixed quantity of air.\r\n\r\nNo less than thirty colonies of organisms were counted in a cubic foot of\r\nair taken from the Golden Gallery of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and 140\r\nfrom the air of the churchyard. An ordinary man would breathe there\r\nthirty-six micro-organisms every minute.\r\n\r\nElectricity has a powerful effect in destroying these organisms. Ozone is\r\ngenerated in the air by lightning, and it is detrimental to them. In fine\r\nozoned Highland air scarcely a disease-germ can be detected. Open sea air\r\ncontains about one germ in two cubic feet. It has been found that in Paris\r\nthe average in summer is about 140 per cubic foot of air, but in bedrooms\r\nthe number is double. During the twenty-four hours of the day the number\r\nof germs is highest about 6 A.M., and lowest about mid-day.\r\n\r\nRaindrops carry the germs to the ground. Hence the advantage of a thunder\r\nplout in a sanitary way. A cubic foot of rain has been found to contain\r\n5500 organic dust-germs, besides 7,000,000,000 of inorganic\r\ndust-particles. In a dirty town the rain will bring down in a year, upon a\r\nsquare foot of surface, no less than 3,000,000 of bacteria, many of them\r\nbeing disease-bearing and death-bearing. No wonder, then, that scientific\r\nmen are using every endeavour to protect the human frame, as well as the\r\nframe of the lower animals, from the baneful inroads of these floating\r\nnuclei of disease and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA CHANGE OF AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nFor weakness of body and fatigue of mind a very common and essentially\r\nserviceable recommendation is \"a change of air.\" Of course, the change of\r\nscene from coast to country, or from town to hillside, may help much the\r\ndepressed in body or mind; and this is very commendable. But, strange to\r\nsay, there is a healing virtue in breathing different air.\r\n\r\nAt first one is apt to think that air is the same all over, as he thinks\r\nwater is--especially outside smoky towns; but both have varied qualities\r\nin different parts. You have only to be assured that in a cubic inch of\r\nbedroom air in the denser parts of a large town there are about 20,000,000\r\nof dust-particles, and in the open air of a heathery mountain-side there\r\nare only some hundreds, to see that there is something after all on the\r\nface of it in the \"old wives' saw.\"\r\n\r\nNot that the dust-particles are all injurious; for most of them are\r\ninorganic, and many of the organic particles are quite wholesome; yet\r\nthere is a change wrought, often very marked, in going from one place to\r\nanother for different air.\r\n\r\nEven in the country, especially in summer-time, one distinctly notices the\r\ngreat difference in the air of lowland and highland localities. The ten\r\nmiles change from Strathmore to Glenisla shows a marked difference in the\r\nair. Below, it is close, weakening, enervating; above, it is exhilarating,\r\ninvigorating, and strong.\r\n\r\nSo people must have a change--at least those who can afford it--for health\r\nmust be seen to first of all, if one has means to do so. Oh! the blessing\r\nof good health! How many who enjoy it never think of the misery of its\r\nloss! In fact, health is the soul that animates all enjoyments of life;\r\nfor without it those would soon be tasteless. A man starves at the\r\nbest-spread table, and is poor in the midst of the greatest treasures\r\nwithout health.\r\n\r\nIn these days half of our diseases come from the neglect of the body in\r\nthe overwork of the brain. The wear and tear of labour and intellect go on\r\nwithout pause or self-pity. Men may live as long as their forefathers, but\r\nthey suffer more from a thousand artificial anxieties and cares. The men\r\nof old fatigued only the muscles, we exhaust the finer strength of the\r\nnerves. Even more so now, then, do we require a change of air to soothe\r\nour overwrought nervous system.\r\n\r\nAnd when that magic power, concealed from mortal view, works such wonders\r\non the health, surely it is one's duty to save up and have it, when it is\r\nwithin one's means. For is not health the greatest of all possessions?\r\nWhat a rich colour clothes the countenance of the young after a month's\r\nouting in the hill country! How fine and pure has the blood become! All\r\nstagnant humours, accumulated in winter town life, have been dispelled by\r\nthe ozone-brightening charm. The weary looking office or shop man is now\r\ntransfigured into a sprightly youth once more, ready with strongly\r\nrecuperated power for another winter's labours. The pale wife, who has\r\nbeen stifled for months in close-aired rooms, has now a healthy flush on\r\nher becoming countenance that speaks of gladly restored health. And all\r\nthis has been brought about by a \"change of air\"!\r\n\r\nFor a thorough change to a town man, he should make for the Highlands.\r\nThere he is never tired of walking, for the air which he breathes is full\r\nof ozone. This revivifying element in the air is produced by the\r\nlightning-bursts from hill to hill. There is in the Highlands a continual\r\nrush of electricity, whether seen or not. Hence the air is very pure, free\r\nfrom organic germs, intensely exhilarating and buoyant.\r\n\r\nSportsmen are livingly aware of the recuperative power of the Highland\r\nair. Perhaps these city men do not benefit so much by the easy walking\r\nexercise on the grouse moors as in breathing the splendidly\r\ndelight-inspiring air. What a change one feels there in a very few hours!\r\n\r\n\"A change of air\" is an old wives' adage. But much of the weather-lore of\r\nour forefathers was based on real scientific principles only now coming to\r\nlight. Nature is ever true, but it requires patience to unravel her\r\nsecrets. We therefore advocate an occasional \"change of air\" to improve\r\nthe health--\r\n\r\n                        \"The chiefest good,\r\n  Bestow'd by Heaven, but seldom understood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MOON IN THE NEW MOON'S ARMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the sun's broad beams have tired the sight, the moon with more sober\r\nlight charms us to descry her beauty, as she shines sublimely in her\r\nvirgin modesty. There is always a most fascinating freshness in the first\r\nsight of the new moon. The superstition of centuries adds to this charm.\r\nWhy boys and girls like to turn over a coin in their pocket at this sight\r\none cannot tell: yet it is done. No young lady likes to look at the new\r\nmoon through a pane of glass. And farmers are always confident of a change\r\nof weather with a new moon: at least in bad weather they earnestly hope\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nBut, banishing all superstition, we welcome the pale silver sickle in the\r\nheavens, once more appearing from the bosom of the azure. And no language\r\ncan equal these beautiful words of the youthful Shelley:--\r\n\r\n                    \"Like the young moon,\r\n  When on the sunlit limits of the night\r\n    Her white shell trembles amid crimson air,\r\n  And while the sleeping tempest gathers might,\r\n    Doth, as the herald of his coming, bear\r\n  The ghost of its dead mother, whose dim form\r\n    Bends in dark ether from her infant's chair.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a more charming way of putting the ordinary expression, \"the old\r\nmoon in the new moon's arms.\" We are regularly accustomed to the\r\nmoonshine, but only occasionally is the _earthshine_ on the moon so\r\nregulated that the shadowed part is visible. This is not seen at the\r\nappearance of every new moon. It depends upon the positions of the sun and\r\nmoon, the state of the atmosphere, and the absence of heavy clouds. I\r\nnever in my life saw the phenomenon so marvellously beautiful as on May\r\n7th, 1894, at my manse in Strathmore. I took particular note of it, as\r\nsome exceedingly curious things were connected with it.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the evening, the new moon issued from some clouds in\r\nthe western heavens, the sun having set, about an hour before. The\r\ncrescent was thin and silvery, and the outline of the shadowed part was\r\njust visible. The sky near the horizon was clear and greenish-hued. As\r\nthe night advanced the moon descended, and at ten o'clock she was\r\napproaching a purple stratum of clouds that stretched over the hills,\r\nwhile the position of the sun was only known a little to the east, by the\r\nback-thrown light upon the dim sky. Through the moisture-laden air the\r\nsun's rays, reflected by the moon, threw a golden stream from the crescent\r\nmoon, for the silvery shell became more golden-hued.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the moon now seemed to project, and the shadowed part became\r\nmore distinct, though the circle appeared smaller. By means of a\r\nfield-glass I noticed that this was extra lighted, with points here and\r\nthere quite golden-tinged. The darker spots showed the deep caverns; the\r\nbrighter points brought into relief the mountain peaks.\r\n\r\nWhy was the surface brighter than usual? I cannot go into detail about the\r\nphases of the moon; but, in a word, I may say that, while the sun can\r\nilluminate the side of the moon turned towards it, it is unable to throw\r\nany light on the shadow, seeing that there is no atmosphere around the\r\nmoon to refract the light.\r\n\r\nIf we, in imagination, looked from the moon upon the earth, we should see\r\nthe same phases as are now noticed in the moon; and when it is just before\r\nnew moon on the earth, the earth will appear fully illuminated from the\r\nmoon. We would also observe (from the moon) that the brightness of the\r\nilluminated part of the earth would vary from time to time, according to\r\nthe changes in the earth's atmosphere. More light would be reflected to\r\nthe moon from the clouds in our atmosphere than from the bare earth or\r\ncloudless sea, since clouds reflect more light than either land or sea.\r\nAccordingly, we arrive at this curious fact--that the extra brightness of\r\nthe _dark_ body of the moon is mainly determined by the amount of _cloud\r\nin our atmosphere_.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I concluded that there must be clouds to the west, though I\r\ncould not see them, which reflected rays of light and faintly illuminated\r\nthe shadowed part of the moon. It had become much colder, and I concluded\r\nthat during the night the cloud-particles, if driven near by the wind,\r\nwould condense into rain. And, assuredly, next morning I was gratified to\r\nfind that rain had fallen in large quantities, substantiating the theory.\r\n\r\nThere is much pleasure in verifying such an interesting problem. The dark\r\nbody of the moon being more than usually visible is one of our well-known\r\nand oldest indications of coming bad weather. And at once came to my\r\nmemory the lines of Sir Patrick Spens, as he foreboded rain for his\r\ncrossing the North Sea:--\r\n\r\n  \"I saw the new moon late yestreen\r\n  Wi' the auld moon in her arm;\r\n  And if we gang to sea, master,\r\n  I fear we'll come to harm.\"\r\n\r\nThis lunar indication, then, has a sound physical basis, showing that near\r\nthe observer there are vast areas of clouds, which are reflecting light\r\nupon the moon at the time, before they condense into rain by the chilling\r\nof the air. According to the old Greek poet, Aratus: \"If the new moon is\r\nruddy, and you can trace the shadow of the complete circle, a storm is\r\napproaching.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAN AUTUMN AFTERGLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nA brilliant afterglow is welcomed for its surpassing beauty and a\r\nprecursor of fine fixed weather.\r\n\r\nA glorious sunset has always had a charm for the lover of nature's\r\nbeauties. The zenith spreads its canopy of sapphire, and not a breath\r\ncreeps through the rosy air. A magnificent array of clouds of numberless\r\nshapes come smartly into view. Some, far off, are voyaging their\r\nsun-bright paths in silvery folds; others float in golden groups. Some\r\nmasses are embroidered with burning crimson; others are like \"islands all\r\nlovely in an emerald sea.\" Over the glowing sky are splendid colourings.\r\nThe flood of rosy light looks as if a great conflagration were below the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nI remember witnessing an especially brilliant sunset last autumn on the\r\nhigh-road between Kirriemuir and Blairgowrie. The setting sun shone upon\r\nthe back of certain long trailing clouds which were much nearer me than a\r\nrange behind. The fringes of the front range were brilliantly golden,\r\nwhile the face of those behind was sparklingly bright. Then the sun\r\ndisappeared over the western hills, and his place was full of spokes of\r\nliving light.\r\n\r\nLooking eastward, I observed on the horizon the base of the northern line\r\nof a beautiful rainbow--\"the shepherd's delight\" for fine weather.\r\n\r\nSoon in the west the light faded; but there came out of the east a lovely\r\nflush, and the general sky was presently flamboyant with afterglow. The\r\nfront set of clouds was darker except on the edges, the red being on the\r\nclouds behind; and the horizon in the east was particularly rich with dark\r\nred hues.\r\n\r\nGradually the eastern glow rose and reddened all the clouds, but the front\r\nclouds were still grey. The effect was very fine in contrast. The fleecy\r\nclouds overhead became transparently light red, as they stretched over to\r\nreach the silver-streaked west. The new moon was just appearing upright\r\nagainst a slightly less bright opening in the sky, betokening the firm\r\nhardness of autumn.\r\n\r\nSoon the colouring melted away, and the peaceful reign of the later\r\ntwilight possessed the land.\r\n\r\nNow why that brilliancy of the east, when the west was colourless? Most of\r\nall you note the immense variety and wealth of reds. These are due to dust\r\nin the atmosphere. We are the more convinced of this by the very\r\nremarkable and beautiful sunsets which occurred after the tremendous\r\neruption at Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda, thirty years ago. There was\r\nthen ejected an enormous quantity of fine dust, which spread over the\r\nwhole world's atmosphere. So long as that vast amount of dust remained in\r\nthe air did the sunsets and afterglows display an exceptional wealth of\r\ncolouring. All observers were struck with the vividly brilliant red\r\ncolours in all shades and tints.\r\n\r\nThe minute particles of dust in the atmosphere arrest the sun's rays and\r\nscatter them in all directions; they are so small, however, that they\r\ncannot reflect and scatter all; their power is limited to the scattering\r\nof the rays at the blue end of the spectrum, while the red rays pass on\r\nunarrested. The display of the colours of the blue end are found in\r\nnumberless shades, from the full deep blue in the zenith to the\r\ngreenish-blue near the horizon.\r\n\r\nIf there were no fine dust-particles in the upper strata, the sunset\r\neffect would be whiter; if there were no large dust-particles, there would\r\nbe no colouring at all. If there were no dust-particles in the air at all,\r\nthe light would simply pass through into space without revealing itself,\r\nand the moment the sun disappeared there would be total darkness. The very\r\nexistence of our twilight depends on the dust in the air; and its length\r\ndepends on the amount and extension upwards of the dust-particles.\r\n\r\nBut how have the particles been increased in size in the east? Because, as\r\nthe sun was sinking, but before its rays failed to illumine the heavens,\r\nthe temperature of the air began to fall. This cooling made the\r\ndust-particles seize the water-vapour to form haze-particles of a larger\r\nsize. The particles in the east first lose the sun's heat, and first\r\nbecome cool; and the rays of light are then best sifted, producing a more\r\ndistinct and darker red. As the sun dipped lower, the particles overhead\r\nbecame a turn larger, and thereby better reflected the red rays.\r\nAccordingly, the roseate bands in the east spread over to the zenith, and\r\npassed over to the west, producing in a few minutes a universal\r\ntransformation glow.\r\n\r\nTo produce the full effect often witnessed, there must be, besides the\r\nordinary dust-particles, small crystals floating in the air, which\r\nincrease the reflection from their surfaces and enhance the glow effects.\r\nIn autumn, after sunset, the water-covered dust-particles become frozen\r\nand the red light streams with rare brilliancy, causing all reddish and\r\ncoloured objects to glow with a rare brightness. Then the air glows with a\r\nstrange light as of the northern dawn. From all this it is clear that,\r\nthough the colouring of sunset is produced by the direct rays of the sun,\r\nthe afterglow is produced by reflection, or, rather, radiation from the\r\nilluminated particles near the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe effect in autumn is a stream of red light, of varied tones, and rare\r\nbrilliancy in all quarters, unseen during the warmer summer. We have to\r\nwitness the sunsets at Ballachulish to be assured that Waller Paton really\r\nimitated nature in the characteristic bronze tints of his richly painted\r\nlandscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA WINTER FOREGLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle attention has been paid to foreglows compared with afterglows,\r\neither with regard to their natural beauty or their weather forecasting.\r\nBut either the ordinary red-cloud surroundings at sunrise, or the western\r\nforeglow at rarer intervals, betokens to the weather-prophet wet and\r\ngloomy weather. The farmer and the sailor do not like the sight, they\r\ndepend so much on favourable weather conditions.\r\n\r\nOf course, sunrise to the aesthetic observer has always its charms. The\r\npowerful king of day rejoices \"as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber\"\r\nas he steps upon the earth over the dewy mountain tops, bathing all in\r\nlight, and spreading gladness and deep joy before him. The lessening\r\ncloud, the kindling azure, and the mountain's brow illumined with golden\r\nstreaks, mark his approach; he is encompassed with bright beams, as he\r\nthrows his unutterable love upon the clouds, \"the beauteous robes of\r\nheaven.\" Aslant the dew-bright earth and coloured air he looks in\r\nboundless majesty abroad, touching the green leaves all a-tremble with\r\ngold light.\r\n\r\nBut glorious, and educating, and inspiring as is the sunrise in itself in\r\nmany cases, there is occasionally something very remarkable that is\r\nconnected with it. Rare is it, but how charming when witnessed, though\r\ntill very recently it was all but unexplained. This is the _foreglow_.\r\n\r\nIt is in no respect so splendid as the afterglow succeeding sunset; but,\r\nbecause of its comparative rarity, its beauty is enhanced. I remember a\r\nforeglow most vividly which was seen at my manse, in Strathmore, in\r\nJanuary 1893. My bedroom window looked due west; I slept with the blind\r\nup. On that morning I was struck, just after the darkness was fading away,\r\nwith a slight colouring all along the western horizon. The skeleton\r\nbranches of the trees stood out strongly against it. The colouring\r\ngradually increased, and the roseate hue stretched higher. The old\r\nwell-known faces that I used to conjure up out of the thin blended boughs\r\nbecame more life-like, as the cheeks flushed. There was rare warmth on a\r\nwinter morning to cheer a half-despairing soul, tired out with the long\r\nhours of oil reading, and pierced to the heart by the never-ceasing\r\nrimes; yet I could not understand it.\r\n\r\nI went to the room opposite to watch the sunrise, for I had observed in\r\nthe diary that the appearance of the sun would not be for a few minutes.\r\nThere were streaks of light in the east above the horizon, but no colour\r\nwas visible. That hectic flush--slight, yet well marked--which was\r\ndeepening in the western heavens, had no counterpart in the east, except\r\nthe colourless light which marked the wintry sun's near approach. As soon\r\nas the sun's rays shot up into the eastern clouds, and his orb appeared\r\nabove the horizon, the western sky paled, the colour left it, as if\r\nashamed of its assumed glory. A foreglow like that I have very rarely\r\nseen, and its existence was a puzzle to me till I studied Dr. Aitken's\r\nexplanation of the afterglows after sunset. I had never come across any\r\ndescription of a foreglow; and, of course, across no explanation of the\r\ncurious phenomenon. The western heavens were coloured with fairly bright\r\nroseate hues, while the eastern horizon was only silvery bright before the\r\nsun rose; whereas, after the sun appeared and coloured the eastern hills\r\nand clouds, the western sky resumed its leaden grey and colourless\r\nappearance. Why was that? What is the explanation?\r\n\r\nI have not space enough to repeat the explanation given already in the\r\nlast chapter of the glorious phenomenon of the afterglow. But the\r\nexplanation is similar. Before sunrise, the rays of the sun are reflected\r\nby dust-particles in the zenith to the western clouds. The colouring is\r\nintensified by the frozen water-vapour on these particles in the west.\r\n\r\nOne thing I carefully noted. Ere mid-day, snow began to fall, and for some\r\ndays a severe snow-storm kept us indoors. Then, at any rate, the foreglow\r\nbetokened a coming storm. It was, like a rainbow in a summer morning, a\r\ndecided warning of the approaching wet weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE RAINBOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poet Wordsworth rapturously exclaimed--\r\n\r\n  \"My heart leaps up when I behold\r\n  A rainbow in the sky.\"\r\n\r\nAnd old and young have always been enchanted with the beautiful\r\nphenomenon. How glorious is the parti-coloured girdle which, on an April\r\nmorning or September evening, is cast o'er mountain, tower, and town, or\r\neven mirrored in the ocean's depths! No colours are so vividly bright as\r\nwhen this triumphal arch bespans a dark nimbus: then it unfolds them in\r\ndue prismatic proportion, \"running from the red to where the violet fades\r\ninto the sky.\"\r\n\r\nA plain description of the formation of the rainbow is not very easily\r\ngiven, but a short sketch may be useful. Beautiful as is the ethereal bow,\r\n\"born of the shower and colour'd by the sun,\" yet the marvellous effect is\r\nmore exquisitely intensified in its gorgeous display when the hand of\r\nscience points out the path in which the sun's rays, from above the\r\nwestern horizon, fall on the watery cloud, indicating fine weather--\"the\r\nshepherd's delight.\"\r\n\r\nOne law of reflection is that, when a ray of light falls on a plane or\r\nspherical surface, it goes off at the same angle to the surface as it\r\nfell. One law of refraction is that, when a ray of light passes through\r\none medium and enters a denser medium (as from air to water), it is bent\r\nback a little. By refraction you see the sun's rays long after the sun has\r\nset; when the sun is just below the horizon, an observer, on the surface\r\nof the earth, will see it raised by an amount which is generally equal to\r\nits apparent diameter.\r\n\r\nThe rays of different colours are bent back (when passing through the\r\nwater) at different rates, some slightly, others more, from the red to the\r\nviolet end. The rainbow, then, is produced by refraction and reflection of\r\nthe several coloured rays of sunlight in the drops of water which make up\r\nfalling rain.\r\n\r\nThe sun is behind the observer, and its rays fall in a parallel direction\r\nupon the drops of rain before him. In each drop the light is dispersively\r\nrefracted, and then reflected from the farther face of the drop; it\r\ntravels back through the drop, and comes out with dispersing colours.\r\n\r\nAccording to the height of the sun, or the slope of its rays, a higher or\r\nlower rainbow will be formed. And, strange, no two people can see the very\r\nsame bow; in fact the rainbow, as seen by the one eye, is not formed by\r\nthe same water-drops as the rainbow seen by the other eye.\r\n\r\nWhen the primary bow is seen in most vivid colours on a dark cloud, a\r\nsecond arch, larger and fainter, is often seen. But the order of the\r\ncolours is quite reversed. At a greater elevation, the sun's ray enters\r\nthe lower side of a drop of rain-water, is refracted, reflected _twice_,\r\nand then refracted again before being sent out to the observer's eye. That\r\nis why the colours are reversed.\r\n\r\n_A one-coloured rainbow_ is a curious and rare phenomenon. It is a strange\r\nparadox, for the very idea of a rainbow brings up the seven colours--red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Yet Dr. Aitken tells us\r\nof a rainbow with one colour which he observed on Christmas Day, in 1888.\r\n\r\nHe was taking his walk on the high ground south of Falkirk. In the east he\r\nobserved a strange pillar-like cloud, lit up with the light of the setting\r\nsun. Then the red pillar extended, curved over, and formed a perfect arch\r\nacross the north-eastern sky. When fully developed, this rainbow was the\r\nmost extraordinary one which he had ever seen. There was no colour in it\r\nbut red. It consisted simply of a red arch, and even the red had a\r\nsameness about it.\r\n\r\nOutside the rainbow there was part of a secondary bow. The Ochil Hills\r\nwere north of his point of observation. These hills were covered with\r\nsnow, and the setting sun was glowing with rosy light. Never had he seen\r\nsuch a depth of colour as was on them on this occasion. It was a deep,\r\nfurnacy red. The sun's light was shorn of all the rays of short-wave\r\nlength on its passage through the atmosphere, and only the red rays\r\nreached the earth. The reason why the Ochils glowed with so deep a red\r\nwas owing to their being overhung by a dense curtain of clouds, which\r\nscreened off the light of the sky. The illumination was thus principally\r\nthat of the direct softer light of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe must be a very careless observer who has not been struck with the\r\nappearance of the streamers which occasionally light up the northern\r\nheavens, and which farmers consider to be indicators of strong wind or\r\nbroken weather.\r\n\r\nThe time was when the phenomenon was considered to be supernatural and\r\nportentous, as the chroniclers of spectral battles, when \"fierce, fiery\r\nwarriors fought upon the clouds, in ranks and squadrons, and right form of\r\nwar.\" And even in the rural districts of Britain, the blood-coloured\r\naurora, of October 24th, 1870, was considered to be the reflection of an\r\nenormous Prussian bonfire, fed by the beleaguered French capital.\r\n\r\nIn joyful spirit, the Shetlanders call the beautiful natural phenomenon,\r\n\"Merry Dancers.\" Burns associated their evanescence with the\r\ntransitoriness of sensuous gratification:--\"they flit ere you can point\r\ntheir place.\" And Tennyson spoke of his cousin's face lit up with the\r\ncolour and light of love, \"as I have seen the rosy red flushing in the\r\nnorthern night.\"\r\n\r\nYet this phenomenon is to a great extent under the control of cosmical\r\nlaws. One of the most difficult problems of our day has been to\r\ndisentangle the irregular webwork of aurorae, and bring them under a law of\r\nperiodicity, which depends upon the fluctuations of the sun's photosphere\r\nand the variations on the earth's magnetism, and which have such an\r\nimportant influence upon the fluctuations of the weather.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Aurora Borealis\" was given to it by Gassendi in 1621.\r\nAfterwards, the old almanacs described it as the \"Great Amazing Light in\r\nthe North.\" In the Lowlands of Scotland, the name it long went by, of\r\n\"Lord Derwentwater's Lights,\" was given because it suddenly appeared on\r\nthe night before the execution of the rebel lord. In Ceylon aurorae were\r\ncalled \"Buddha Lights.\"\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of an aurora borealis is commonly a low arch of pale,\r\ngreenish-yellow light, placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian.\r\nSometimes rays cover the whole sky, frequently showing tremulous motion\r\nfrom end to end; and sometimes they appear to hang from the sky like the\r\nfringes of a mantle. They are among the most capricious of natural\r\nphenomena, so full of individualities and vagaries. To the glitter of\r\nrapid movement they add the charm of vivid colouring. It is strongly\r\nasserted that aurorae are preceded by the same general phenomena as\r\nthunder-storms. This was borne out by Piazzi Smith (late Astronomer-Royal\r\nfor Scotland), who observed that their monthly frequency varies inversely\r\nwith that of thunder-storms--both being safety-valves for the discharge of\r\nsurplus electricity.\r\n\r\nCareful observers have, moreover, noticed a remarkable coincidence\r\nbetween the display of aurorae and the maxima of the sun's spots and of the\r\nearth's magnetic disturbances. Some have supposed that the light of the\r\naurora is caused by clouds of meteoric dust, composed of iron, which is\r\nignited by friction with the atmosphere. But there is this difficulty in\r\nthe way, shooting stars are more frequent in the morning, while the\r\nreverse is the case with the aurora. The highest authorities have\r\nconcluded, pretty uniformly, that aurorae are electric discharges through\r\nhighly rarefied air, taking place in a magnetic field, and under the sway\r\nof the earth's magnetic induction. They are not inappropriately called\r\n\"Polar lightnings,\" for when electricity misses the one channel it must\r\ntraverse the other.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Arctic regions of North America pretend to foretell\r\nwind by the rapidity of the motions of the streamers. When they spread\r\nover the whole sky, in a uniform sheet of light, fine weather ensues.\r\nFitzroy believed that aurorae in northern latitudes indicated and\r\naccompanied stormy weather at a distance. The same idea is still current\r\namong many farmers and fishermen in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIs there any audible accompaniment to the brilliant spectacle? The natives\r\nof some parts, with subtle hearing-power, speak of the \"whizzing\" sound\r\nwhich is often heard during auroral displays. Burns tells of their\r\n\"hissing, eerie din,\" as echoes of the far-off songs of the Valkyries.\r\nPerhaps the most striking incident which corroborates this opinion\r\noccurred during the Franco-Prussian War. Rolier, a practised aeronaut,\r\nleft Paris in a balloon, on his mission of city defence, and fourteen\r\nhours afterwards landed in Norway. He had reached the height of two and a\r\nhalf miles. When descending, he passed through a peculiar cloud of\r\nsulphurous odour, which emitted flashed light and a slight scratching or\r\nrustling noise. On landing, he witnessed a splendid aurora borealis. He\r\nmust, therefore, have passed through a cloud in which an electrical\r\ndischarge of an auroral nature was proceeding, accompanied with an audible\r\nsound. There is, moreover, no improbability of such sounds being\r\noccasionally heard, since a somewhat similar phenomenon accompanies the\r\nbrush discharge of the electric machinery, to which the aurora bears\r\nconsiderable resemblance.\r\n\r\nThough no fixed conclusions are yet established about the causes of the\r\nbrilliant auroral display, yet, as the results of laborious observations,\r\nwe are assured that the stabler centre of our solar system holds in its\r\npowerful sway the several planets at their respective distances, supplying\r\nthem all with their seasonable light and heat, vibrating sympathetic\r\nchords in all, and even controlling under certain--though to us still\r\nunknown--laws the electric streamers that flit, apparently lawlessly, in\r\nthe distant earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE SKY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look at the sky overhead, when cloudless in the sunshine, we wonder\r\nwhat gives the air such a deep-blue colour. We are not looking, as\r\nchildren seem to do, into vacancy, away into the far unknown. And even, if\r\nthat were the case, would not the space be quite colourless? What, then,\r\nproduces the blueness?\r\n\r\nSome of the very fine dust-particles, even when clothed with an\r\nexceedingly thin coating of water-vapour, are carried very high; and,\r\nlooking through a vast accumulation of these, we find the effect of a\r\ndeep-blue colour.\r\n\r\nWhy so? Because these particles are so small that they can only reflect\r\nthe rays of the blue end of the spectrum; and the higher we ascend, the\r\nsmaller are the particles and the deeper is the blue. But it is also\r\nbecause water, even in its very finest and purest form, is blue in colour.\r\nFor long this was disputed. Even Sir Robert Christison concluded, after\r\nyears of experimenting on Highland streams, that water was colourless.\r\n\r\nOf course, he admitted that the water in the Indian and Pacific Oceans has\r\nfrequent patches of red, brown, or white colour, from the myriads of\r\nanimalcules suspended in the water. Ehrenberg found that it was vegetable\r\nmatter which gave to the Red Sea its characteristic name. But these, and\r\nsimilar waters, are not pure.\r\n\r\nIt is to Dr. Aitken that the final discovery of the real colour of water\r\nis due. When on a visit to several towns on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, he set about making some very interesting experiments,\r\nwhich the reader will follow with pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that colour transmitted through different bodies\r\ndiffers considerably from colour reflected by them. In his first\r\nexperiment he took a long empty metal tube, open at one end, and closed\r\nat the other end by a clear-glass plate. This was let down vertically into\r\nthe water, near to a fixed object, which appeared of most beautiful deep\r\nand delicate blue at a depth of 20 feet. Scientific men know that, if the\r\ncolour of water is due to the light reflected by extremely small particles\r\nof matter suspended in the water, then the object looked at through it\r\nwould have been illuminated with yellow (the complementary colour of\r\nblue). A blackened tube was then filled with water (which had a\r\nclear-glass plate fixed to the bottom), and white, red, yellow, and purple\r\nobjects were sunk in the water, and these colours were found to change in\r\nthe same way as if they were looked at through a piece of pale-blue glass.\r\nThe white object appeared blue, the red darkened very rapidly as it sank,\r\nand soon lost its colour; at the depth of seven feet a very brilliant red\r\nwas so darkened as to appear dark brick-red. The yellow object changed to\r\ngreen, and the purple to dark blue.\r\n\r\nBut, still further to satisfy himself that water is really blue in itself,\r\neven without any particles suspended in it, he tested the colour of\r\n_distilled_ water. He filled a darkened tube with this water (clear-glass\r\nplates being at the ends of the tube), and looked through it at a white\r\nsurface. The effect was the same as before, the colour was blue, almost\r\nexactly of the same hue as a solution of Prussian blue.\r\n\r\nThis is corroborated by the fact that, the purer the water is in nature,\r\nthe bluer is the tint when a large quantity is looked through. Some\r\nHighland lochs have crystal waters of the most extraordinary blue. Of\r\ncourse, some cling to the old idea that this is accounted for by the\r\nreflected blue of the clear heavens above. No doubt, if the sky be deep\r\nblue, then this blue light, when reflected by the surface of the water,\r\nwill enrich and deepen the hue. But the water itself is _really_ blue.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the dust-particles suspended in the water have a great\r\neffect in making the water appear more beautiful, brilliant, and varied in\r\nits colouring; because little or no light is reflected by the interior of\r\na mass of water itself. If a dark metal vessel be filled with a weak\r\nsolution of Prussian blue, the liquid will appear quite dark and void of\r\ncolour. But throw in some fine white powder, and the liquid will at once\r\nbecome of a brilliant blue colour. This accounts for the change of depth\r\nand brilliancy of colour in the several shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, you look at the face of a deep-blue lake on a summer\r\nevening--the heavens all aglow with the unrivalled display of colour from\r\nthe zenith, stretching in lighter hues of glory to the horizon--though to\r\nyou the calm water appears like a lake of molten metal glowing with\r\nsky-reflected light, so powerful and brilliant as entirely to overpower\r\nthe light which is internally reflected, yet blue is the normal colour of\r\nthe water: _blueness is its inherent hue_.\r\n\r\nLooking upwards, we observe three distinct kinds of blue in the sky from\r\nthe horizon to the zenith. All painters in water-colours know that. Newton\r\nthought that the colour of the sky was produced in the same way as the\r\ncolours in thin plates, the order of succession of the colours gradually\r\nincreasing in intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA SANITARY DETECTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impure state of the air in the rooms of a house can now be determined\r\nby means of colour alone. Dr. Aitken has invented a very simple instrument\r\nfor that purpose; and this ought to be of great service to sanitary\r\nofficers. It is called the koniscope--or dust-detective.\r\n\r\nThe instrument consists of an air-pump and a metal tube with glass ends.\r\nNear one end of the test-tube is a passage by which it communicates with\r\nthe air-pump, and near the other end is attached a stop-cock for admitting\r\nthe air to be tested. It is not nearly so accurate as the dust-counter;\r\nbut it is cheaper, more easily wrought, and more handy for quick work. All\r\nthe grades of blue, from what is scarcely visible to deep, dark blue, may\r\nbe attached alongside the tube on pieces of coloured glass; and opposite\r\nthese colours are the numbers of dust-particles in the cubic inch of the\r\nsimilar air, as determined by the dust-counter.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of particles was counted by means of the dust-counter,\r\nthe depth of blue given by the koniscope was noted; and the piece of glass\r\nof that exact depth of blue attached. A metal tube was fitted up\r\nvertically in the room, in such a way that it could be raised to any\r\ndesired height into the impure air near the ceiling, so that supplies of\r\nair of different degrees of impurity might be obtained. To produce the\r\nimpurity, the gas was lit and kept burning during the experiments. The air\r\nwas drawn down through the pipe by means of the air-pump of the koniscope,\r\nand it passed through the measuring apparatus of the dust-counter on its\r\nway to the koniscope. It may be remarked that, by a stroke of the\r\nair-pump, the air within the test-tube is rarefied and the dust-particles\r\nseize the moisture in the super-saturated air to form fog-particles;\r\nthrough this fog the colour is observed, and the shade of colour\r\ndetermines the number of dust-particles in the air. These colours are\r\nnamed \"just visible,\" \"very pale blue,\" \"pale blue,\" \"fine blue,\" \"deep\r\nblue,\" and \"very deep blue.\"\r\n\r\nWhen making a sanitary inspection, the pure air should be examined first,\r\nand the colour corresponding to that should be considered as the normal\r\nhealth colour. Any increase from the depth would indicate that the air was\r\nbeing gradually contaminated; and the amount of increase in the depth of\r\ncolour would indicate the amount of increase of pollution.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of what this instrument can detect, a room of 24 by 17\r\nby 13 feet was selected. The air was examined before the gas was lighted,\r\nand the colour in the test-tube was very faint, indicating a clear\r\natmosphere. In all parts of the room this was found the same. A small tube\r\nwas attached to the test-tube, open at the other end, for taking air from\r\ndifferent parts of the room. Three jets of gas were then lit in the centre\r\nof the room, and observations at once begun with the koniscope.\r\n\r\nWithin thirty-five seconds of striking the match to light the gas, the\r\nproducts of combustion had extended near the ceiling to the end of the\r\nroom; this was indicated by the colour in the koniscope suddenly becoming\r\na deep blue. In four minutes the deep-blue-producing air was got at a\r\ndistance of two feet from the ceiling. In ten minutes there was strong\r\nevidence of the pollution all through the room. In half-an-hour the\r\nimpurity at nine feet from the floor was very great, the colour being an\r\nintensely deep blue.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of the indications of the instrument, from pure clearness\r\nto nearly black blue, makes the estimate of the impurity very easily taken\r\nwith it; and, as there are few parts to get out of order, it is hoped it\r\nmay come into general use for sanitary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nFOG AND SMOKE\r\n\r\n\r\nJust two hundred and forty years ago, Mr. John Evelyn, F.R.S., a\r\nwell-known writer on meteorology, sent a curious tract to King Charles\r\nII., which was ordered to be printed by his Majesty. It was entitled\r\n\"Fumifugium,\" and dealt with the great smoke nuisance in London. I find\r\nfrom the thesis that he had a very hazy idea of the connection between fog\r\nand smoke; and no wonder, for it is only lately that the connection has\r\nbeen fully explained.\r\n\r\nWe know that without dust-particles there can be no fog, and that smoke\r\nsupplies a vast amount of such particles. Therefore, in certain states of\r\nthe atmosphere, the more smoke the more fog. In Mr. Evelyn's day the fog,\r\nwhich he called \"presumptuous smoake,\" was at times so dense that men\r\ncould hardly discern each other for the \"clowd.\" His Majesty's only sister\r\nhad complained of the damage done to her lungs by the contamination, and\r\nMr. Evelyn was disgusted at the apathy of the people to do anything to\r\nremedy the nuisance. He deplored that that glorious and ancient city of\r\nLondon should wrap her stately head in \"clowds of smoake, so full of stink\r\nand darknesse.\" He was of opinion that a method of charring coal so as to\r\ndivest it of its smoke, while leaving it serviceable for many purposes,\r\nshould be made the object of a very strict inquiry. And he was right. For\r\nit is now known that fog in a town is intensified by much smoke.\r\n\r\nIn a city like London or Glasgow, where a great river, fed by warm streams\r\nof water from gigantic works, passes through its centre, fogs can never be\r\nentirely obliterated, for the dust-particles in the air (often four\r\nmillions and upwards in the cubic inch) will seize with terrible avidity\r\nthe warm vapour rising from the river. That is the main reason why fogs\r\ncannot there be put down. Smoke is being consumed to a great extent; yet\r\nwe find particles of sulphur remaining, which seize the warm vapour and\r\nform fogs dense enough to check all traffic. The worst form of city fogs\r\nseems to be produced when the air, after first flowing slowly in one\r\ndirection, then turns on its tracks and flows back over the city,\r\nbringing with it a black pall, the accumulated products of previous days,\r\nto which gets added the smoke and other impurities produced at the time.\r\n\r\nWhat irritated Mr. Evelyn was that, outside of London, the air was clear\r\nwhen passengers could not walk in safety within the city. So vexed was he\r\nabout the contamination, that he made it the occasion of all the \"cathars,\r\nphthisicks, coughs, and consumption in the city.\" He appealed to common\r\nsense to testify that those who repair to London soon take some serious\r\nillness. \"I know a man,\" he said, \"who came up to London and took a great\r\ncold, which he could never afterwards claw off again.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Evelyn proposed that, by an Act of Parliament, the nuisance be\r\nremoved; enjoining that all breweries, dye-works, soap and salt boilers,\r\nlime-burners, and the like, be removed five or six miles distant from\r\nLondon below the river Thames. That would have materially helped his\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nBut there is more difficulty in the purification than he anticipated. Yet\r\nthere was pluck in the old man pointing out the killing contamination and\r\nsuggesting a possible remedy. He had the fond idea that thereby a certain\r\ncharm, \"or innocent magick,\" would make a transformation scene like\r\nArabia, which is therefore \"styl'd the Happy, attracting all with its gums\r\nand precious spices.\" In purer air fogs would be less dense, breathing\r\nwould be easier, business would be livelier, life would be happier.\r\n\r\nFew, I suppose, have laid their hands on this curious Latin thesis, or its\r\nquaint translation, directing the King's attention to the fogs that were\r\nruining London. Since that time the city has increased, from little more\r\nthan a village, to be the dwelling-place of six millions of human beings,\r\nyet too little improvement has been made in the removal of this fog\r\nnuisance. King Edward's drive through London would be even more dangerous\r\non a muggy, frosty day than was Charles II.'s, when science was little\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL DEPOSITION OF SMOKE\r\n\r\n\r\nA good deal of scientific work is being done in the way of clearing away\r\nfog and smoke; and this, through time, may have some practical results in\r\nremoving a great source of annoyance, illness, and danger in large towns.\r\nSir Oliver Lodge and Dr. Aitken have been throwing light upon the\r\ndeposition of smoke in the air by means of electricity.\r\n\r\nIf an electric discharge be passed through a jar containing the smoke from\r\nburnt magnesium wire, tobacco, brown paper, and other substances, the dust\r\nwill be deposited so as to make the air clear. Brush discharge, or\r\nanything that electrifies the air itself, is the most expeditious.\r\n\r\nIf water be forced upwards through a vertical tube (with a nozzle\r\none-twentieth of an inch in diameter), it will fall to the ground in a\r\nfine rain; but, if a piece of rubbed (electrified) sealing-wax be held a\r\nyard distant from the place where the jet breaks into drops, they at once\r\nfall in large spots as in a thunder-shower. If paper be put on the ground\r\nduring the experiment, the sound of pattering will be observed to be\r\nquite different. If a kite be flown into a cloud, and made to give off\r\nelectricity for some time, that cloud will begin to condense into rain.\r\n\r\nExperiments with Lord Kelvin's recorder show that variations in the\r\nelectrical state of the atmosphere precede a change of weather. Then, with\r\na very large voltaic battery, a tremendous quantity of electricity could\r\nbe poured into the atmosphere, and its electrical condition could be\r\ncertainly disturbed. If this could be made practically available, how\r\nuseful it would be to farmers when the crops were suffering from excessive\r\ndrought! It might be more powerfully available than the imagined\r\ncondensation of a cloud into rain by the reverberation caused by the\r\nfiring of a range of cannon.\r\n\r\nBut what is the practical benefit of this information? If electricity\r\ndeposits smoke, it might be made available in many ways. The fumes from\r\nchemical works might be condensed; and the air in large cities, otherwise\r\npolluted, might be purified and rendered innocuous. The smoke of chimneys\r\nin manufacturing works might be prevented from entering the atmosphere at\r\nall. In flour-mills and coal-mines the fine dust is dangerously explosive.\r\nIn lead, copper, and arsenic works, it is both poisonous and valuable.\r\n\r\nLead smelters labour under this difficulty of condensing the fume which\r\nescapes along with the smoke from red-lead smelting furnaces; and it was\r\nconsidered that an electrical process of condensation might be made\r\nserviceable for the purpose. At Bagillt, the method used for collecting or\r\ncondensing the lead fume is a large flue two miles long; much is retained\r\nin this flue, but still a visible cloud of white-lead fume continually\r\nescapes from the top of the chimney. There is a difficulty in the way of\r\ndepositing fumes in the flue by means of a sufficient discharge of\r\nelectricity, viz. the violent draught which is liable to exist there, and\r\nwhich would mechanically blow away any deposited dust.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Aitken suggests that regenerators might be used along with the\r\nelectricity. The warm fumes might be taken to a cold depositor, where (by\r\nthe ordinary law of cold surfaces attracting warm dust-particles) the\r\nimpurities would be removed, and, when purified, the air would again be\r\ntaken through a hot regenerator before being sent up the chimney. By a\r\nsuccession of these chambers, with the assistance of electric currents,\r\nthe air, impregnated with the most deleterious particles, or valuable\r\ndust, could be rendered innocuous.\r\n\r\nThe sewage of our towns must be cleaned of its deleterious parts before\r\nbeing run into the streams which give drink to the lower animals, because\r\nan Act of Parliament enforces the process. Why, then, ought we not to have\r\nsimilar compulsion for making the smoke from chemical and other noxious\r\nworks quite harmless before being thrown into the air which contains the\r\noxygen necessary for the life of human beings?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a good field before electricians to catch the smoke on\r\nthe wing and deposit its dust on a large scale. This seems to be a matter\r\nbeyond our reach at present, except in the scientist's laboratory; but\r\ncertainly it is a \"consummation devoutly to be wished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nRADIATION FROM SNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night a most interesting paper by Dr. Aitken, on \"Radiation from\r\nSnow,\" was read by Professor Tait to the Fellows of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh. I remember that Dr. Alex. Buchan--the greatest meteorologist\r\nliving--spoke afterwards in the very highest terms of the subject-matter\r\nof the paper. This was corroborated by Lord Kelvin, Lord MacLaren, and\r\nProfessor Chrystal.\r\n\r\nDr. Aitken had been testing the radiating powers of different substances.\r\nSnow in the shade on a bright day at noon is 7 deg. Fahr. colder than the air\r\nthat floats upon it, whereas a black surface at the same is only 4 deg.\r\ncolder. This difference diminishes as the sun gets lower; and at night\r\nboth radiate almost equally well.\r\n\r\nI select, among the careful and numerous observations, the notes on\r\nJanuary 19, 1886; for I took note of the cold of that day in my diary. It\r\nwas the coldest day of the whole of that winter. The barometer was 28.8\r\ninches, and the thermometer 4 deg.--that is, 28 deg. of frost. According to Dr.\r\nBuchan, that January had only two equal in average cold for fifty years.\r\n\r\nOn January 19, at 10 A.M., when the air was at 20 deg. and the sky clear, a\r\nblack surface registered 16 deg. and the upper layer of snow 12 deg., showing a\r\ndifference of 4 deg. when both surfaces were colder than the superincumbent\r\nair. It is curious to note that, on February 5 of the same year, at the\r\nsame hour, when the sky was overcast, the air was at 23 deg., the black\r\nsurface registered 29 deg., and the snow 25 deg., showing again the difference of\r\n4 deg.; but, in this case, both surfaces were warmer than the air. In both\r\ncases the radiation at night was equal.\r\n\r\nThis small absorbing power of snow for heat reflected and radiated from\r\nthe sky during the day must have a most important effect on the\r\ntemperature of the air. The temperature of lands when covered with snow\r\nmust be much lower than when free from it. And, when once a country has\r\nbecome covered with snow, there will be a tendency towards glacial\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBut, besides being a bad absorber of heat from the sky, snow is also a\r\nvery poor conductor of heat. On that very cold night (January 18), when\r\nthere was a depth of 5-1/2 inches of snow on the ground, and the night\r\nclear, with strong radiation, the temperature of the surface of the snow\r\nwas 3 deg. Fahr., and a minimum thermometer on the snow showed that it had\r\nbeen down to zero some time before. A thermometer, plunged into the snow\r\ndown to the grass, gave the most remarkable register of 32 deg. Through the\r\ndepth of 5-1/2 inches of snow there was a difference of temperature of\r\n29 deg. This was confirmed by removing the snow, and finding that the grass\r\nwas unfrozen. As the ground was frozen when the snow fell, it would appear\r\nthat the earth's heat slowly thawed it under the protection of the snow.\r\n\r\nThe protection afforded by the bad-conducting power of snow is of great\r\nimportance in the economy of nature. How vegetation would suffer, were it\r\nexposed to a low temperature, unprotected by the snow-mantle! So that,\r\nthough the continued snow cools the air for animals that can look after\r\ntheir own heating, it keeps warm the soil; and vegetation prospers under\r\nthe genial covering. The fine rich look of the young wheat-blades, after a\r\ncontinued snow has melted, must strike the most careless observer. Instead\r\nof the half-blackened tips and semi-sickly blades, which we see in a field\r\nof young wheat after a considerable course of dry frost without snow, we\r\nhave a rich, healthy green which shows the vital energy at work in the\r\nplants. Or even in the town gardens, after a continued snow has been\r\nmelted away by a soft, western breeze, we are struck with the white,\r\npeeping buds of the snowdrop and the finely springing grass in the sward.\r\n\r\nYet the snow-covering gives durability to cold weather. This has been\r\ndemonstrated by Dr. Woeikof, the distinguished Russian meteorologist. On\r\nthis account the spring months of Russia and Siberia are intensely cold.\r\nThe plants, then, which in winter are unable by locomotion to keep\r\nthemselves in health, are protected by the snow-mantle which chills the\r\nair for animals that can keep themselves in heat by exercise. What a grand\r\ncompensating power is here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN GIANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSome mysterious physical phenomena can be clearly explained by the aid of\r\nscience. The mountain giants that at times haunt the lonely valleys, and\r\nstrike with fear the superstitious dwellers there, are only the enlarged\r\nshadows of living human beings cast upon a dense mist.\r\n\r\nThe two most startling of these \"eerie\" phenomena are the spectres of\r\nAdam's Peak and the Brocken.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena sometimes to be observed at Adam's Peak, in Ceylon, are very\r\nremarkable. Many travellers have given vivid accounts of these. On one\r\noccasion the Hon. Ralph Abercromby, in his praiseworthy enthusiasm for\r\nmeteorological research, went there with two scientific friends to witness\r\nthe strange appearance. The conical peak, a mile and a half high,\r\noverlooks a gorge west of it. When, then, the north-east monsoon blows the\r\nmorning mist up the valley, light wreaths of condensed vapour pass to the\r\nright of the Peak, and catch the shadows at sunrise.\r\n\r\nThis party reached the summit early one morning in February. The foreglow\r\nbegan to brighten the under-surface of the stratus-cloud with orange, and\r\npatches of white mist filled the hollows. Soon the sun peeped through a\r\nchink in the clouds, and they saw the pointed shadow of the Peak lying on\r\nthe misty land. Then a prismatic circle, with the red inside, formed round\r\nthe shadow. The meteorologist waved his arms about, and immediately he\r\nfound giant shadowy arms moving in the centre of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nSoon they saw a brighter and sharper shadow of the Peak, encircled by a\r\ndouble bow, and their own spectral arms more clearly visible. The shadow,\r\nthe double bow, and the giant forms, combined to make this phenomenon the\r\nmost marked in the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe question has been frequently asked: Why are such aerial effects not\r\nmore widely observed? There are not many mountains of this height and of a\r\nconical shape; and still fewer can there be where a steady wind, for\r\nmonths together, blows up a valley so as to project the rising morning\r\nmist at a suitable height and distance on the western side, to catch the\r\nshadow of the peak at sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe most famous place in Europe for witnessing the awe-inspiring\r\nphenomenon is the Brocken, in Germany--3740 feet in height. The only great\r\ndisappointment there is that the conditions rarely combine at sunrise or\r\nsunset to have \"the spectre\" successful.\r\n\r\nIn July 1892, my daughter and I were spending some weeks at Harzburg, and,\r\nof course, we had to visit the Brocken and take stock of the world-known\r\nphenomenon. At mid-day, the air at the flat summit was cold, clear, and\r\nhard. The boulders are of enormous size; and near the \"Noah's Ark\" Hotel\r\nand Observatory many are piled up in a mass, on which the observers stand\r\nat the appointed time for having their shadows projected on the misty air\r\nin the valleys.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon the sky was brilliantly clear on the\r\nsummit of the Brocken; but the wind was rising from the sun's direction,\r\nand the mist was filling up the wide-spread eastern valley. We stood on\r\nthe \"spectre\" boulders, and our shadows were thrown on the grass, just as\r\nat home. However, they fell upon large patches of white heather, which\r\nthere is very plentiful.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the sun was still shining beautifully, and we anxiously\r\nwaited for the time when it would be low enough to raise our shadows to\r\nthe misty wall. An hour afterwards, a hundred visitors were out, and many\r\nof us were on the \"spectre\" stones. There was great excitement in\r\nanticipation of the weird appearances, which had attracted us from such a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nBut, almost at the moment of success, the sun descended behind a belt of\r\npurple cloud, and all we saw was part of a rainbow on the misty hollow.\r\nFor the sun never appeared again. This was intensely saddening, seeing\r\nthat, but for that stratum of cloud above the horizon, the phenomenon\r\nwould have been graphically displayed.\r\n\r\nThe cold became suddenly intense, and we had to sleep with a freezing mist\r\nenveloping the hotel. In vain did we wait for the wakening call, to tell\r\nus of sunrise; for the sun could not pierce the mist, and we had to return\r\nhome disappointed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rainbow colours assume the shapes of crosses instead of\r\ncircles. Occasionally a bright halo will be seen above the shadow-head of\r\nthe observer, concentric rainbows enclosing all. In some recorded cases\r\nthe grand effect must have been simply glorious.\r\n\r\nScientific observation has done much to dispel the superstition which has\r\nclung so tenaciously to the Highland mind. The lonely grandeur of the\r\nweird mountain giants has been clearly explained as perfectly natural, yet\r\nthe awe-striking feeling cannot be entirely driven off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce was the remark pointedly made: \"The wind bloweth where it listeth.\"\r\nAnd that is nearly true still. The leading winds are under the calculation\r\nof the meteorologist, but the others will not be bound by laws.\r\n\r\nYet there are instruments for measuring the velocity and force of the\r\nwind, after it is on; but \"whence it comes\" is a different matter. A\r\ngentle air moves at the rate of 7 miles an hour; a hurricane from 80 to\r\n150 miles, pressing with 50 lbs. on the square foot exposed to its fury.\r\nSome of the gusts of the Tay Bridge storm, in 1879, had a velocity of 150\r\nmiles an hour, with a pressure of 80 to 90 lbs. to the square foot.\r\n\r\nBefore steamers supplanted so many sailing vessels, seamen required to be\r\nalways on the alert as to the direction and strength of the wind, and the\r\nlikelihood of any sudden change; and they chronicled twelve different\r\nstrengths from \"faint air\" to a \"storm.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, the wind may be considered to be the result of a change of\r\npressure and temperature in the atmosphere at the same level. The air of a\r\nwarmer region, being lighter, ascends, and gives place to a current of\r\nwind from a colder region. These two currents--the higher and the\r\nlower--will continue to blow until there is equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe trade winds are regular and constant. These were much followed in the\r\ndays of old. A vast amount of air in the tropics gets heated and ascends,\r\nbeing lighter, and travels to the colder north. A strong current rushes in\r\nfrom the north to take its place. But the earth rotates round its axis\r\nfrom west to east, and the combined motions make two slant wind\r\ndirections, which are called the \"trade winds,\" because they were so\r\nimportant in trade navigation.\r\n\r\nAmong the periodical winds are the \"land and sea breezes.\" During the day,\r\nthe land on the sea coast is warmer than the sea; accordingly, the air\r\nover the land becomes heated and ascends, the fine cool breeze from the\r\nsea taking its place. Towards evening there is the equilibrium of\r\ntemperature which produces a temporary calm. Soon the earth chills, and\r\nthe sea is counterbalancingly warm--as sea-water is steadier as to\r\ntemperature than is land--the air over the sea becomes warmer, and\r\nascends, the current from the land rushing in to take its place. Hence\r\nduring the night the wind is reversed, until in the morning again the\r\nequilibrium is restored and there is a calm, so far as these are\r\nconcerned. These are therefore called the \"land and sea breezes.\" Of\r\ncourse, it is within the tropics that these breezes are most marked. By\r\nthe assistance of other winds, a hurricane will there occasionally destroy\r\ntowns and bring about much damage and loss of life; but better that\r\nhundreds should perish by a hurricane than thousands by the pestilence\r\nwhich, but for the storm, would have done its dire work.\r\n\r\nIn countries where the differences of pressure are more marked than the\r\ndifferences of temperature, in the surrounding regions the strength of\r\nthe wind thereby occasioned is far stronger than the land and sea breezes.\r\n\r\nThe variable winds are more conflicting. These depend on purely local\r\ncauses for a time, such as \"the nature of the ground, covered with\r\nvegetation or bare; the physical configuration of the surface, level or\r\nmountainous; the vicinity of the sea or lakes, and the passage of storms.\"\r\nAmong these winds are the simoom and sirocco.\r\n\r\nThe _east_ winds, which one does not care about in the British Islands\r\nduring the spring time, are occasioned by the powerful northern current\r\nwhich rushes south from the northern regions in Europe. Dr. Buchan points\r\nout a very common mistake among even intelligent observers who shudder at\r\nthe hard east winds. It is generally held that these winds are damp. They\r\nare unhealthy, but they are dry. It is quite true that many easterly winds\r\nare peculiarly moist; all that precede storms are so far damp and rainy;\r\nand it is owing to this circumstance that, on the east coast of Scotland,\r\nthe east winds are searching and carry most of the annual rainfall there.\r\nBut all of these moist easterly winds, however, soon turn to some westerly\r\npoint. The real east wind, so much feared by invalids, does not turn to\r\nthe west; it is exceeding dry. Curious is it that brain diseases, as well\r\nas consumption, reach their height in Britain while east winds prevail.\r\nOnce in Edinburgh, during the early spring, I had rheumatic fever, and\r\nduring my convalescence my medical adviser, Dr. Menzies, would not let me\r\nhave a short drive until the wind changed to the west. The first thing I\r\nanxiously watched in the morning was the flag on the Castle; and for\r\nnearly two months it always waved from the east. How heart-depressing!\r\n\r\nCreatures are we in the hands of nature's messengers. We so much depend\r\nupon the weather for our happiness. Joyful are we when the honey-laden\r\nzephyr waves the long grass in June, or when\r\n\r\n  \"The gentle wind, a sweet and passionate wooer,\r\n  Kisses the blushing leaf.\"\r\n\r\nCompared with this, how terrible is Shakespeare's allusion to the\r\nappalling aspects of the storm:--\r\n\r\n  \"I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds\r\n  Have rived the knotty oaks; and I have seen\r\n  The ambitious ocean swell, and rage and foam,\r\n  To be exalted with the threat'ning clouds;\r\n  But never till to-night, never till now,\r\n  Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nCYCLONES AND ANTI-CYCLONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the weather in the meteorological column of our daily\r\nnewspapers invariably speaks of \"cyclones.\" It is, therefore, advisable to\r\ngive as plain an explanation of these as possible. Cyclones are\r\n\"storm-winds.\" Their nature has to be carefully studied by meteorologists,\r\nwho are industriously at work to ascertain some scientific basis for the\r\natmospheric movements.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of the spiral movement in storm-winds? In their centre\r\nthe depression of the barometer is lowest, because the atmosphere there is\r\nlightest. As the walls of the spiral are approached, the barometer rises.\r\n\r\nDr. Aitken has ingeniously hit upon an experiment to illustrate a spiral\r\nin air. All that is necessary is a good fire, a free-going chimney, and a\r\nwet cloth. The cloth is hung up in front of the fire, and pretty near it,\r\nso that steam rises readily from its surface; and, when there are no\r\nair-currents in the room, the steam will rise vertically, keeping close to\r\nthe cloth. But if the room has a window in the wall, at right angles to\r\nthe fireplace, so as to cause the air coming from it to make a\r\ncross-current past the fire, then a cyclone will be formed, and the vapour\r\nfrom the cloth will be seen circling round. When the cyclone is well\r\nformed, all the vapour is collected into the centre of the cyclone, and\r\nforms a white pillar extending from the cloth to the chimney. This\r\nexperiment shows that no cyclone can form without some tangential motion\r\nin the air entering the area of low-pressure.\r\n\r\nNow to illustrate the spiral approach. Fill with water a cylindrical glass\r\nvessel, say 15 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep. Have an orifice with\r\na plug a little from the centre of the bottom. Remove the plug, the water\r\nruns out, passing round the vessel in a vortex form. But, as the passage\r\nbetween the orifice (or centre of the cyclone) and the temporary division\r\nis narrower than in any other place, the water has to pass this part much\r\nmore quickly than at any other place. And this curious result is observed:\r\nthe top of the cyclone no longer remains over the orifice, but _travels_\r\nin the direction of the water which is moving most speedily. Similar to\r\nthis is the cyclone in the atmosphere; its centre also moves in the\r\ndirection of the quickest flowing wind that enters it.\r\n\r\nDr. Aitken is of opinion that, in forecasting storms, too little attention\r\nhas been paid to the _anti-cyclones_. They do more than simply follow and\r\nfill up the depression made by the cyclones. They initiate and keep up\r\ntheir own circulation, and collect the materials with which the cyclones\r\nproduce their effect. Neither could work efficiently without the other.\r\n\r\nSuppose a large area on the earth over which the air is still in bright\r\nsunshine. After a time, when the air gets heated and charged with vapour,\r\ncolumns of air would begin to ascend in a disorderly fashion. But suppose\r\nan anti-cyclone is blowing at one side of this area. When the upper air\r\ndescends to the earth, it spreads outwards in all directions; but the\r\nearth's rotation interferes and changes the radial into a spiral motion.\r\nThe anti-cyclonic winds will prevent the formation of local cyclones, and\r\ndrive all the moist, hot air to its circumference, just above the earth.\r\nThe anti-cyclone forces its air tangentially into the cyclone, and gives\r\nit its direction and velocity of rotation, also the direction and rate of\r\ntravel of the centre of depression. The earth's rotation is the original\r\nsource of the rotatory movements, but both intensify the initial motion.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the cyclone must travel in the direction of the strongest\r\nwinds blowing into it, just as the vortex in the vessel with the eccentric\r\norifice travelled in the direction of the quickest moving water. This is\r\nverified by a study of the synoptic charts of the Meteorological Office.\r\n\r\nThe sun's heat has always been looked upon as the main source of the\r\nenergy of our winds, but some account must also be taken of the effects of\r\ncold. It is well known that the mean pressure over Continental areas is\r\nhigh during winter and low during summer. As the sun's rays during summer\r\ngive rise to the cyclonic conditions, so the cooling of the earth during\r\nwinter gives rise to anti-cyclonic conditions. It is found during the\r\nwinter months in several parts of the Continent that as the temperature\r\nfalls the pressure rises, producing anti-cyclones over the cold area;\r\nwhereas, when the temperature begins to rise, the pressure falls, and\r\ncyclones are attracted to the warming area.\r\n\r\nSmall natural cyclones are often seen on dusty roads, the whirling column\r\nhaving a core of dusty air, and the centre of the vortex travelling along\r\nthe road, tossing up the dust in a very disagreeable way to pedestrians.\r\nSometimes such a cyclone will toss up dry leaves to a height of four or\r\nfive feet. They are very common; but it is only when dust, leaves, or\r\nother light material is present that they are visible to the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nRAIN PHENOMENA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft rain on a genial evening, or the heavy thunder-showers on a\r\nbroiling day, are too well known to be written about. Sometimes rain is\r\nearnestly wished for, at other times it is dreaded, according to the\r\nseason, seed-time or harvest. Some years, like 1826, are very deficient in\r\nrainfall, when the corn is stunted and everything is being burnt up; other\r\nyears, like 1903, there is an over-supply, causing great damage to\r\nagriculture. The year 1903 will long be remembered for its continuous\r\nrainfall; it is the record year; no year comes near it for the total\r\nrainfall all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nRain is caused by anything that lowers the temperature of the air below\r\nthe dew-point, but especially by winds. When a wind has blown over a\r\nconsiderable area of ocean on to the land, there is a likelihood of rain.\r\nWhen this wind is carried on to higher latitudes, or colder parts, there\r\nis a certainty of rain. Of course, in the latter case the rain will fall\r\nheavier on the wind side than on the lee side.\r\n\r\nFor short periods, the heaviest falls or \"plouts\" of rain are during\r\nthunder-storms. When the raindrops fall through a broad, cold stratum of\r\nair, they are frozen into hail, the particles of which sometimes reach a\r\nlarge size, like stones. Of course, water-spouts now and again are of\r\nterrible violence.\r\n\r\nOne of the heaviest rainfalls yet recorded in Great Britain was about\r\n2-1/4 inches in forty minutes at Lednathie, Forfarshire, in 1887. Now 1\r\ninch deep of rain means 100 tons on an imperial acre; so the amount of\r\nwater falling on a field during that short time is simply startling. The\r\nheaviest fall for one day was at Ben Nevis Observatory, being fully 7-1/4\r\ninches in 1890. In other parts of the world this is far exceeded. In one\r\nday at Brownsville, Texas, nearly 13 inches fell in 1886. On the Khasi\r\nhills, India, 30 inches on each of five successive days were registered.\r\nAt Gibraltar, 33 inches were recorded in twenty-six hours.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest rainfalls of the globe are occasioned by the winds that have\r\nswept over the most extensive ocean-areas in the tropics. On the summer\r\nwinds the rainfall of India mainly depends; when this fails, there is most\r\ndistressing drought. Reservoirs are being erected to meet emergencies.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Buchan's statistics it is found that the annual rainfall at\r\nMahabaleshwar is 263 inches; at Sandoway 214; and at Cherra-pungi 472\r\ninches, the largest known rainfall anywhere on the globe. Over a large\r\npart of the Highlands of Scotland more than 80 inches fall annually, while\r\nin some of the best agricultural districts there it does not exceed 30\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nOf all meteorological phenomena, rainfall is the most variable and\r\nuncertain. Symons gives as tentative results from twenty years'\r\nobservations in London--(1) In winter, the nights are wetter than the\r\ndays; (2) in spring and autumn, there is not much difference; (3) in\r\nsummer, nearly half as much again by day as by night.\r\n\r\nThe wearisomeness of statistics may be here relieved by a short\r\nconsideration of the _splash_ of a drop of rain. Watching the\r\ndrop-splashes on a rainy day in the outskirts of the city, when unable to\r\nget out, I brought to my recollection the marvellous series of experiments\r\nmade by Professor A. M. Worthington in connection with these phenomena. Of\r\ncourse, I could not see to proper advantage the formation of the\r\nsplashes, as the heavy raindrops fell into these tiny lakes on the quiet\r\nroad. There is not the effect of the huge thunder-drops in a stream or\r\npool. The building up of the bubbles is not here perfect, for the domes\r\nfail to close, nor are the emergent columns visible to the naked eye. It\r\nis a pity; for R. L. Stevenson once wrote of them in his delightful\r\n\"Inland Voyage,\" when he canoed in the Belgian canals, as thrown up by the\r\nrain into \"an infinity of little crystal fountains.\"\r\n\r\nBeautiful is this effect if one is under shelter, every dome seeming quite\r\ndifferent in contour and individuality from all the rest. But terrible is\r\nit when out fishing on Loch Earn, even with the good-humoured old Admiral,\r\nwhen the heavy thunder-drops splash up the crystal water, and one gets\r\nsoaked to the skin, sportsman-like despising an umbrella.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a scientific interest about the splash of a drop. The\r\nphenomenon can be best seen indoors by letting a drop of ink fall upon the\r\nsurface of pure water in a tumbler, which stands on white paper. It is an\r\nexquisitely regulated phenomenon, which very ideally illustrates some of\r\nthe fundamental properties of fluids.\r\n\r\nWhen a drop of milk is let fall upon water coloured with aniline dye, the\r\ncentre column of the splash is nearly cylindrical, and breaks up into\r\ndrops before or during its subsequent descent into the liquid. As it\r\ndisappears below the surface, the outward and downward flow causes a\r\nhollow to be again formed, up the sides of which a ring of milk is\r\ncarried; while the remainder descends to be torn a second time into a\r\nbeautiful vortex ring. This shell or dome is a characteristic of all\r\nsplashes made by large drops falling from a considerable height, and is\r\nextremely pretty. Sometimes the dome closes permanently over the\r\nimprisoned air, and forms a large bubble floating upon the water. The most\r\nsuccessful experiments, however, have been carried through by means of\r\ninstantaneous photography, with the aid of a Leyden-jar spark, whose\r\nduration was less than the ten-millionth of a second. But the simple\r\nexperiments, without the use of the apparatus, will while away a few hours\r\non a rainy afternoon, when condemned to the penance of keeping within\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE METEOROLOGY OF BEN NEVIS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral large and very important volumes of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\r\nare devoted to statistics connected with the meteorology of Ben Nevis.\r\nMost of the abstracts have been arranged by Dr. Buchan; while Messrs.\r\nBuchanan, Omond, and Rankine have taken a fair share of the work.\r\n\r\nThis Observatory, as Mr. Buchanan remarks, is unique, for it is\r\nestablished in the clouds; and the observations made in it furnish a\r\nrecord of the meteorology of the clouds. It is 4406 feet above the level\r\nof the sea; and as there is a corresponding Observatory at Fort William,\r\nat the base of the mountain, it is peculiarly well fitted for important\r\nobservations and weather forecasting. The mountain, too, is on the west\r\nsea-coast of Scotland, exposed immediately to the winds from the Atlantic,\r\ncatching them at first hand. It is lamentable to think that, when the\r\nimportance of the observations made at the two Observatories was becoming\r\nworld known, funds could not be got to carry them on. Ben Nevis is the\r\nhighest mountain in the British Islands, best fitted for meteorological\r\nobservations; yet these have been stopped for want of money.\r\n\r\nDr. Buchan's valuable papers were published before any one dreamed of the\r\nstoppage of the work, which had such an important bearing on men engaged\r\nin business or taken up with open-air sport. From these I shall sift out a\r\nfew facts that even \"mute, inglorious\" meteorologists may be interested in\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the importance of the study of the changes of the\r\nweather has come gradually to be recognised, and an additional impetus was\r\ngiven to the prosecution of this branch of meteorology when it was seen\r\nthat the subject had intimate relations to the practical question of\r\nweather forecasts, including storm warnings. Weather maps, showing the\r\nstate of the weather over an extensive part of the surface of the globe,\r\nbegan to be constructed; but these were only indicators from places at the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe singular advantages of a high-level observatory occurred to Mr. Milne\r\nHome in 1877; and Ben Nevis was considered to be in every respect the most\r\nsuitable in this country. The Meteorological Council of the Royal Society\r\nof London offered in 1880, unsolicited, L100 annually to the Scottish\r\nMeteorological Society, to aid in the support of an Observatory, the only\r\nstipulation being that the Council be supplied with copies of the\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nFrom June to October, in 1881, Mr. Wragge made daily observations at the\r\ntop of the Ben; and simultaneous observations were made, by Mrs. Wragge,\r\nat Fort William. A second series, on a much more extended scale, was made\r\nin the following summer.\r\n\r\nFunds were secured to build an Observatory; and, in November 1883, the\r\nregular work commenced, consisting of hourly observations by night as well\r\nas by day. Until a short time ago, these were carried on uninterruptedly.\r\nTelegraphic communications of each day's observations were sent to the\r\nmorning newspapers; and now we are disappointed at not seeing them for\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the observations of temperature and humidity were of\r\nnecessity eye-observations. For self-registering thermometers were\r\ncomparatively useless when the wind was sometimes blowing at the rate of\r\n100 miles an hour. Saturation was so complete in the atmosphere that\r\neverything exposed to it was dripping wet. Every object exposed to the\r\noutside frosts of winter soon became thickly incrusted with ice.\r\nSnowdrifts blocked up exposed instruments. Accordingly, the observers had\r\nto use their own eyes, often at great risks.\r\n\r\nThe instruments in the Ben Nevis Observatory, and in the Observing Station\r\nat Fort William, were of the best description. Both stations were in\r\npositions where the effects of solar and terrestrial radiation were\r\nminimised. No other pair of meteorological stations anywhere in the world\r\nare so favourably situated as these two stations, for supplying the\r\nnecessary observations for investigating the vertical changes of the\r\natmosphere. It is to be earnestly hoped, therefore, that funds will be\r\nsecured to resume the valuable work.\r\n\r\nThe rate of the decrease of temperature with height there is 1 deg. Fahr. for\r\nevery 275 feet of ascent, on the mean of the year. The rate is most rapid\r\nin April and May, when it is 1 deg. for each 247 feet; and least rapid in\r\nNovember and December, when it is 1 deg. for 307 feet. This rate agrees\r\nclosely with the results of the most carefully conducted balloon ascents.\r\nThe departures from the normal differences of temperature, but more\r\nespecially the inversions of temperature, and the extraordinarily rapid\r\nrates of diminution with height, are intimately connected with the\r\ncyclones and anti-cyclones of North-Western Europe; and form data, as\r\nvaluable as they are unique, in forecasting storms.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of the climate of Ben Nevis is the repeated\r\noccurrence of excessive droughts. For instance, in the summer and early\r\nautumn of 1885, low humidities and dew-points frequently occurred.\r\nCorresponding notes were observed at sea-level. During nights when\r\ntemperature falls through the effects of terrestrial radiation, those\r\nparts of the country suffer most from frosts over which very dry states of\r\nthe air pass or rest; whereas, those districts, over which a more humid\r\natmosphere hangs, will escape. On the night of August 31 of that year, the\r\npotato crop on Speyside was totally destroyed by the frost; whereas at\r\nDalnaspidal, in the district immediately adjoining, potatoes were\r\nscarcely--if at all--blackened.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual pressure at Ben Nevis was 25.3 inches, and at Fort William\r\n29.8, the difference being 4-1/2 inches for the 4400 feet.\r\n\r\nFor the whole year, the difference between the mean coldest hour, 5 A.M.,\r\nand the warmest hour, 2 P.M., is 2 deg. For the five months, from October to\r\nFebruary, the mean daily range of temperature varied only from O.6 to 1.5.\r\nThis is the time of the year when storms are most frequent; and this small\r\nrange in the diurnal march of the temperature is an important feature in\r\nthe climatology of Ben Nevis; for it presents, in nearly their simple\r\nform, the great changes of temperature accompanying storms and other\r\nweather changes, which it is so essential to know in forecasting weather.\r\n\r\nThe daily maximum velocity of the wind occurs during the night, the daily\r\ndifferences being greatest in summer and least in winter. A blazing sun in\r\nthe summer daily pours its rays on the atmosphere, and a thick envelope of\r\ncloud has apparently but little influence on the effect of the sun's rays.\r\nThunder-storms are essentially autumn and winter phenomena, being rare in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Buchanan, the weather on Ben Nevis is characterised by\r\ngreat prevalence of fog or mist. In continuously clear weather it\r\npractically never rains on the mountain at all. In continuously foggy\r\nweather, on the other hand, the average daily rainfall is 1 inch. There is\r\na large and continuous excess of pressure in clear weather over that of\r\nfoggy weather. The mean temperature of the year is 3-1/2 degrees higher\r\nin clear than in foggy weather. In June the excess is 10 degrees. The\r\nnocturnal heating in the winter is very clearly observed. This has been\r\nnoticed before in balloons as well as on mountains. The fog and mist in\r\nwinter are much denser than in summer. Whether wet or dry, the fog which\r\ncharacterises the climate of the mountain is nothing but _cloud_ under\r\nanother name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER AND INFLUENZA\r\n\r\n\r\nSome remarkable facts have been deduced by the late Dr. L. Gillespie,\r\nMedical Registrar, from the records of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.\r\nHe considered that it might lead to interesting results if the admissions\r\ninto the medical wards were contrasted with the varying states of the\r\natmosphere. The repeated attacks of influenza made him pay particular\r\nattention to the influence of the weather on that disease.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological facts taken comprise the weekly type of weather, _i.e._\r\ncyclonic or anti-cyclonic, the extremes of temperature for the district\r\nfor each week, and the mean weekly rainfall for the same district. More\r\nuse is made of the extremes than of the mean, for rapid changes of\r\ntemperature have a greater influence on disease than the actual mean.\r\n\r\nThe period which he took up comprises the seven years 1888-1895. There was\r\na yearly average of admissions of 3938; so that he had a good field for\r\nobservation. Six distinct epidemics of influenza, varying in intensity,\r\noccurred during that period; yet there had been only twenty-three attacks\r\nbetween 1510 and 1890. Accordingly, these six epidemics must have had a\r\ngreat influence on the incidence of disease in the same period, knowing\r\nthe vigorous action of the poison on the respiratory, the circulatory, and\r\nthe nervous systems. The epidemics of influenza recorded in this country\r\nhave usually occurred during the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe first epidemic, which began on the 15th of December 1889 and continued\r\nfor nine weeks, was preceded by six weeks of cyclonic weather, which was\r\nnot, however, accompanied by a heavy rainfall. Throughout the course of\r\nthe disease, the type continued to be almost exclusively cyclonic, with a\r\nheavy rainfall, a high temperature, and a great deficiency of sunshine.\r\nThe four weeks immediately following were also chiefly cyclonic, but with\r\na smaller rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe summer epidemic of 1891 followed a fine winter and spring, during\r\nwhich anti-cyclonic conditions were largely prevalent. But the epidemic\r\nwas immediately preceded by wet weather and a low barometer. It took place\r\nin dry weather, and was followed by wet, cyclonic weather in turn.\r\n\r\nThe great winter epidemic of 1891 followed an extremely wet and broken\r\nautumn. Simultaneously with the establishment of an anti-cyclone, with\r\neast wind, practically no rain, and a lowering temperature, the influenza\r\ncommenced. Great extremes in the temperature followed, the advent of\r\nwarmer weather and more equable days witnessing the disappearance of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe fourth epidemic was preceded by a wet period, ushered in by dry\r\nweather, accompanied by great heat; and its close occurred in slightly\r\nwetter weather, but under anti-cyclonic conditions. The fifth outbreak\r\nbegan after a short anti-cyclone had become established over our islands,\r\ncontinued during a long spell of cyclonic weather with a considerable\r\nrainfall, but was drowned out by heavy rains. The last appearance of the\r\nmodern plague, of which Dr. Gillespie's paper treats, commenced after cold\r\nand wet weather, continued in very cold but drier weather, and subsided in\r\nwarmth with a moderate rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of these six epidemics were very variable in some respects,\r\nand regular in others. The most constant condition was the decreased\r\nrainfall at the time, when the disease was becoming epidemic.\r\nAnti-cyclonic weather prevailed at the time.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Gillespie, the tables seem to suggest that a type of\r\nweather, which is liable to cause catarrhs and other affections of the\r\nrespiratory tract, precedes the attacks of influenza; but that the\r\noccurrence of influenza in _epidemic form_ does not appear to take place\r\nuntil another and drier type has been established. As the weather changes,\r\nthe affected patients increase with a rush.\r\n\r\nHe is of opinion that the supposed rapid spread of influenza on the\r\nestablishment of anti-cyclonic conditions may be explained in this way.\r\nThe air in the cyclonic vortex, drawn chiefly from the atmosphere over the\r\nocean, is moist, and contains none of the contagion; the air of the\r\nanti-cyclone, derived from the higher strata, and thus from distant\r\ncyclones, descending, blows gently over the land to the nearest cyclone,\r\nand, being drier, is more able to carry suspended particles with it. He\r\nconsiders that temperature has nothing to do with the problem, except in\r\nso far as the different types of weather may modify it. The Infirmary\r\nrecords point to the occurrence of similar phenomena, recorded on previous\r\noccasions. Accordingly, if such meteorological conditions are not\r\nindispensable to the spread of influenza in epidemic form, they at least\r\nafford favourable facilities for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne is not far up in years, in Scotland at any rate, without practically\r\nrealising what climate means. He may not be able to put it in words, but\r\neasterly haars, chilling rimes, drizzling mists, dagging fogs, and\r\nsoddening rains speak eloquently to him of the meaning of climate.\r\n\r\nClimate is an expression for the conditions of a district with regard to\r\ntemperature, and its influence on the health of animals and plants. The\r\nsun is the great source of heat, and when its rays are nearly\r\nperpendicular--as at the Tropics--the heat is greater on the earth than\r\nwhen the slanted rays are gradually cooled in their passage. As one passes\r\nto a higher level, he feels the air colder, until he reaches the\r\nfluctuating snow-line that marks perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the atmosphere also depends upon the radiation from the\r\nearth. Heat is quite differently radiated from a long stretch of sand, a\r\ndense forest, and a wide breadth of water. Strange is it that a newly\r\nploughed field absorbs and radiates more heat than an open lea. The\r\nequable temperature of the sea-water has an influence on coast towns. The\r\nGulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico, heats the ocean on to the west coast\r\nof Britain, and mellows the climate there.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall of a district has a telling effect on the climate. Boggy land\r\nproduces a deleterious climate, if not malaria. Over the world, generally,\r\nthe prevailing winds are grand regulators of the climate in the\r\ndistinctive districts. A wooded valley--like the greatest in Britain,\r\nStrathmore--has a health-invigorating power: what a calamity it is, then,\r\nthat so many extensive woods, destroyed by the awful hurricane twelve\r\nyears ago, are not replanted!\r\n\r\nSome people can stand with impunity any climate; their \"leather lungs\"\r\ncannot be touched by extremes of temperature; but ordinary mortals are\r\nmere puppets in the hands of the goddess climate. Hence health-resorts are\r\nmunificently got up, and splendidly patronised by people of means. The\r\npoor, fortunately, have been successful in the struggle for existence, by\r\ninnate hardiness, otherwise they would have had a bad chance without ready\r\ncash for purchasing health.\r\n\r\nIt may look ludicrous at first sight, but it seems none the less true,\r\nthat the variation of the spots on the sun have something to do with\r\nclimate, even to the produce of the fields. On close examination, with a\r\nproper instrument, the disc of the sun is found to be here and there\r\nstudded with dark spots. These vary in size and position day after day.\r\nThey always make their first appearance on the same side of the sun, they\r\ntravel across it in about fourteen days, and then they disappear on the\r\nother side. There is a great difference in the number of spots visible\r\nfrom time to time; indeed, there is what is called the minimum period,\r\nwhen none are seen for weeks together, and a maximum period, when more are\r\nseen than at any other time. The interval between two maximum periods of\r\nsun-spots is about eleven years. This is a very important fact, which has\r\nwonderful coincidences in the varied economy of nature.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff has shown, by means of the spectroscope, that the temperature of\r\na sun-spot must be lower than that of the remainder of the solar surface.\r\nAs we must get less heat from the sun when it is covered with spots than\r\nwhen there are none, it may be considered a variable star, with a period\r\nof eleven years. Balfour Stewart and Lockyer have shown that this period\r\nis in some way connected with the action of the planets on the\r\nphotosphere. As we have already mentioned, the variations of the magnetic\r\nneedle have a period of the same length, its greatest variations occurring\r\nwhen there are most sun-spots. Aurorae, and the currents of electricity\r\nwhich traverse the earth's surface, follow the same law. This remarkable\r\ncoincidence set men a-thinking. Can the varying condition of the sun exert\r\nany influences upon terrestrial affairs? Is it connected with the\r\nvariation of rainfall, the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere,\r\nand the frequency of storms? Has the regular periodicity of eleven years\r\nin the sun-spots no effect upon climate and agricultural produce?\r\n\r\nMr. F. Chambers, of Bombay, has taken great trouble to strike, as far as\r\npossible, a connection between the recurring eleven years of sun-spots and\r\nthe variation of grain prices. He arranged the years from 1783 to 1882 in\r\nnine groups of eleven years; and, from an examination of his tables, we\r\nfind that there is a decided tendency for high prices to recur at more or\r\nless regular intervals of about eleven years, and a similar tendency for\r\nlow prices. An occasional slight difference can be accounted for by some\r\nabnormal cause, as war or famine.\r\n\r\nAmid all the apparently irregular fluctuations of the yearly prices, there\r\nis in every one of the ten provinces of India a periodical rise and fall\r\nof prices once every eleven years, corresponding to the regular variation\r\nwhich takes place in the number of sun-spots during the same period. If it\r\nwere possible to obtain statistics to show the actual out-turn of the\r\ncrops each year, the eleven yearly variations calculated therefrom might\r\nreasonably correspond with the sun-spot variations even more closely than\r\ndo the price variations.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable coincidence, if nothing more. What if it were yet\r\npossible to predict the variations of prices in the coming sun-spot cycle?\r\nSuch a power would be of immense service. By its aid it could be predicted\r\nthat, as the present period of low prices has followed the last maximum of\r\nsun-spots, which was in the year 1904, it will not last much longer, but\r\nthat prices must gradually keep rising for the next five years. Could\r\nscience really predict this, it would be studied by many and blessed by\r\nmore. Yet the strange coincidence of a century's observations renders the\r\nconclusions not only possible, but to some extent probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE \"CHALLENGER\" WEATHER REPORTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ Expedition, commenced by Sir Wyville Thomson, and after\r\nhis death continued by Sir John Murray, with an able staff of assistants\r\nfor the several departments, was one of the splendid exceptions to the\r\nordinary British Government stinginess in the furtherance of science. The\r\nresults of the Expedition were printed in a great number of very handsome\r\nvolumes at the expense of the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd the valuable deductions from the _Challenger's_ Weather Reports by Dr.\r\nAlex. Buchan, in his \"Atmospheric Circulation,\" have thrown considerable\r\nlight upon oceanic weather phenomena. For some of his matured opinions on\r\nthese, I am here much indebted to him.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, in 1817, published a treatise on \"Isothermal Lines,\" which\r\ninitiated a fresh line for the study of atmospheric phenomena. An isotherm\r\nis an imaginary line on the earth's surface, passing through places having\r\na corresponding temperature either throughout the year or at any\r\nparticular period. An isobar is an imaginary line on the earth's surface,\r\nconnecting places at which the mean height of the barometer at sea-level\r\nis the same. To isobars, as well as to isotherms, Dr. Buchan has devoted\r\nconsiderable attention. In 1868, he published an important series of\r\ncharts containing these, with arrows for prevailing winds over the earth\r\nfor the months of the year. In this way what are called synoptic charts\r\nwere established.\r\n\r\nIn the _Challenger_ Report are shown the various movements of the\r\natmosphere, with their corresponding causes. It is thus observed that the\r\nprevailing winds are produced by the inequality of the mass of air at\r\ndifferent places. The air flows from a region of higher to a region of\r\nlower pressure, _i.e._ from where there is an excessive mass of air to\r\nfill up some deficiency. And this is the great principle on which the\r\nscience of meteorology rests, not only as to winds, but as to weather\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nOf the sun's rays which reach the earth, those that fall on the land are\r\nabsorbed by the surface layer of about 4 feet in thickness. But those that\r\nfall on the surface of the ocean penetrate, as shown by the observations\r\nof the _Challenger_ Expedition, to a depth of about 500 feet. Hence, in\r\ndeep waters the temperature of the surface is only partially heated by the\r\ndirect rays of the sun. In mid-ocean the temperature of the surface\r\nscarcely differs 1 deg. Fahr. during the whole day, while the daily variation\r\nof the surface layer of land is sometimes 50 deg. The temperature of the air\r\nover the ocean is about three times greater than that of the surface of\r\nthe open sea over which it lies; but, near land, this increases to five\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe elastic force of vapour is seen in its simplest form on the open sea,\r\nas disclosed by these Reports. It is lowest at 4 A.M. and highest at 2\r\nP.M. The relative humidity is just the reverse. When the temperature is\r\nhighest, the saturation of the air is lowest, and _vice versa_. So on land\r\nwhen the air, by radiation of heat from the earth, is cooled below the\r\ndew-point, dew is produced, and, at the freezing-point, hoar-frost.\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ Reports, too, show that the force of the winds on the\r\nopen sea is subject to no distinct and uniform daily variation, but that\r\non nearing land the force of the wind gives a curve as distinctly marked\r\nas the ordinary curve of temperature. That force is lowest from 2 to 4\r\nA.M., and highest from 2 to 4 P.M. Each of the five great oceans gives the\r\nsame result. At Ben Nevis, on the other hand, these forces are just\r\nreversed in strength.\r\n\r\nIt is also shown by the _Challenger_ observations that on the open sea the\r\ngreatest number of thunder-storms occur from 10 P.M. to 8 A.M. And, from\r\nthis, Dr. Buchan concludes that over the ocean terrestrial radiation is\r\nmore powerful than solar radiation in causing those vertical disturbances\r\nin the equilibrium of the atmosphere which give rise to the thunder-storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nWEATHER-FORECASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nTo foretell with any degree of certainty the state of the weather for\r\ntwenty-four hours is of immense advantage to business men, tourists,\r\nfishermen, and many others. The weather is everybody's business. And the\r\nprobabilities of accurate forecasts are so improving that all are more or\r\nless giving attention to the morning meteorological reports.\r\n\r\nWeather-forecasting depends on the principle from vast experience that, if\r\none event happens, a second is likely to follow. According to the extent\r\nand accuracy of the data, will be the strength of the probability of\r\ncorrect forecasts. And the great end of popular meteorology is to\r\ndemonstrate this.\r\n\r\nWe have given some explanations of the weather in some respects unique;\r\nand a careful consideration of these explanations will the more convince\r\nthe reader of the importance of the subject. No doubt the changes of the\r\nweather are extremely complex, at times baffling; and the wonder is that\r\nforecasts come so near the truth.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the year 1903 almost defied the ordinary rules of weather,\r\nfor it broke the record for rainfall. And, last year, so repulsive and\r\nunseasonable was the spring, that there seemed to be a virtual\r\n\"withdrawal\" of the season. I wrote on it as \"The Recession of Spring.\"\r\nSpeak about Borrowing Days! We had the equinoctial gales of March about\r\nthe middle of April. On very few days had we \"clear shining to cheer us\r\nafter rain,\" for the bitter cold dried up any genial moisture. An old\r\nfarmer remarked that \"We're gaun ower faur North.\" No one could account\r\nfor the backwardness of the season. Unless for the cheering songs of the\r\ngrove-charmers, one would have forgotten the time of the year.\r\n\r\nIn March of this year, at Strathmore, the barometer fell from 30.5 inches\r\n(the highest for years) to 28.65 in five days without unfavourable weather\r\nfollowing. It again rose to 30.05, then fell to 28.45, followed by a rise\r\nto 28.7 without any peculiar change. But in two days it fell to 28.4 (the\r\nlowest for years), followed by a deluge of rain and a perfect hurricane\r\nfor several hours, while the temperature was fortunately mild. It was only\r\nevident at the end that this universal storm had been \"brewing\" some days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAll are familiar with the ordinary prognostics of good and bad weather. A\r\n\"broch\" round the moon, in her troubled heaven, indicates a storm of rain\r\nor wind. When the dark crimson sun in the evening throws a brilliant\r\nbronzed light on the gables and dead leaves, we are sure that there is an\r\nintense radiation from the earth to form dew, or even hoar-frost.\r\n\r\nAccording to the meteorological folk-lore, the weather of the summer\r\nseason is indicated by the foliation of the oak and ash trees. If the oak\r\ncomes first into leaf, the summer will be hot and dry, if the ash has the\r\nprecedence it will be wet and cold. Looking over the observations of the\r\nbudding of these two trees for half a century, I find that the\r\nweather-lore adage has been pretty correct. The ash was out before the oak\r\na full month in the years 1816, '17, '21, '23, '28, '29, '30, '38, '40,\r\n'45, '50, and '59; and the summer and autumn in these years were\r\nunfavourable. Again, the oak was out before the ash several weeks in the\r\nyears 1818, '19, '20, '22, '24, '25, '26, '27, '33, '34, '35, '36, '37,\r\n'42, '46, '54, '68, and '69; the summers during these years were dry and\r\nwarm, and the harvests were abundant. One can never think of this weather\r\nprognostic from nature without recalling the Swallow Song of Tennyson's\r\n\"Princess\":--\r\n\r\n  \"Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\r\n  Delaying, as the tender ash delays\r\n  To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\"\r\n\r\nOn a muggy morning a sudden clearness in the south \"drowns the ploughman.\"\r\nAnd yet enough blue in the sky \"tae mak' a pair o' breeks\" cheers one with\r\nthe assurance of coming dry and sunny weather. The low flying of the\r\nswallows betokens rain, as well as any unseasonable dancing of midges in\r\nthe evening. Sore corns on the feet, and rheumatism in the joints, are\r\ndireful precursors. The leaves are all a-tremble before the approach of\r\nthunder. But throughout this volume I have given many illustrations.\r\n\r\nBut one of the largest and most important practical problems of\r\nmeteorology is to ascertain the course which storms follow, and the causes\r\nby which that course is determined, so that a forecast may thereby be\r\nmade, not only of the certain approach of a storm, but the particular\r\ndirection and force of the storm. The method of conducting this large\r\ninquiry most effectively was devised by the French astronomer, Le\r\nVerrier--the great aspirant, with our own Couch Adams, for the discovery\r\nof the planet Neptune. He began to carry this out in 1858 by the daily\r\npublication of weather data, followed by a synchronous weather map, which\r\nshowed graphically for the morning of the day of publication the\r\natmospheric pressure and the direction and force of the wind, together\r\nwith tables of temperature, rainfall, cloud, and sea disturbances from a\r\nlarge number of places in all parts of Europe. It is from similar maps\r\nthat forecasts of storms are still framed, and suitable warnings issued;\r\nand a mass of information is being collected by telegraph from sixty\r\nstations in the British Islands, &c., of the state of the weather at eight\r\no'clock every morning, and analysed and arranged at the Meteorological\r\nOffice in London for the evening's forecasts over the different districts\r\nof the country. A juster knowledge is being now acquired of those great\r\natmospheric movements, and other changes, which form the groundwork of\r\nweather-forecasting.\r\n\r\nThe Meteorological Office, Westminster (entirely distinct from the Royal\r\nMeteorological Society), is administered by a Council (Chairman, Sir R.\r\nStrachey; Scottish member, Dr. Buchan), selected by the Royal Society. It\r\nemploys a staff of over forty. The chief departments relate to: (1) Ocean\r\nMeteorology, including the collection, tabulation, and discussion of\r\nmeteorological data from British ships, the preparation of ocean weather\r\ncharts, and the issue of meteorological instruments to the Royal Navy and\r\nMercantile Marine; (2) Weather Telegraphy, including the reception of\r\ntelegrams thrice a day from selected stations for the preparation of the\r\ndaily reports and weather forecasts. Representatives of newspapers, &c.,\r\nreceive copies of the 11 A.M. forecast based on the 8 A.M. observations;\r\nand also of the 8.30 P.M. forecasts based on the observations received\r\nearlier in the day. In summer and autumn harvest forecasts are issued by\r\ntelegraph to individuals who will defray the cost. The Office also\r\ncollects climatological data from a number of voluntary and some\r\nsubsidised stations. The \"first order\" stations include Valentia,\r\nFalmouth, Kew, and Aberdeen. These have self-recording instruments of high\r\nprecision, giving a continuous record of the meteorological elements.\r\n\r\nA Government Commission which sat last year, under the Rt. Hon. Sir\r\nHerbert Maxwell, Bart., have issued a Report, recommending a number of\r\nchanges in the management and constitution of the Meteorological Office;\r\nand considerable modifications are not unlikely to take place in the near\r\nfuture. In his evidence before that Commission, the Chairman of the\r\nCouncil acknowledged that the great function of meteorologists is the\r\ncollection of facts; but the interpretation of those collected facts, in a\r\nscientific manner, is still in a very immature condition. Dr. Buchan, in\r\nhis evidence, confessed that forecasting by the Council is purely \"by rule\r\nof thumb.\" It is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules for\r\nforecasting.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the storm-warning telegrams, as a rule, the earliest\r\ntrustworthy indication of the approach of a dangerous storm to the coasts\r\nof the British Isles precedes the storm by only a few hours. Delays are\r\ntherefore very serious.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by the best British meteorologists that the observations of\r\nthe United States are better conducted, although the best instruments in\r\nthe world are set and registered at Kew, in England. The work of weather\r\nforecasts and storm warnings is carried on with the highest degree of\r\npromptitude and efficiency at the Washington Central Office. This is\r\nbecause the work of predictions has been hitherto the chief work of the\r\nOffice: the entire time of the observers, on whose telegraphic reports the\r\nforecasts are based, is controlled by the United States Weather Bureau;\r\nand the right of precedence in the use of wires is maintained.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brueckner, of Berne, has devoted a lifetime to the comparatively\r\nnew treatment of climatic oscillations, based upon observations made at\r\n321 points on the earth's surface, distributed as follows: Europe, 198;\r\nAsia, 39; N. America, 50; Cen. and S. America, 16; Australia, 12; Africa,\r\n6. One of his conclusions is that an average time of about thirty-five\r\nyears is found to intervene between one period of excess or deficiency of\r\nwarmth and the next, accompanied by the opposite relative condition of\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nAll are familiar with the hoisting of cone-warning as indication of a\r\ncoming storm. This work is exceedingly important, especially for those\r\nconnected with the sea by business or pleasure. On the known approach of a\r\ncyclone of dangerous intensity, special messages are sent from the London\r\nMeteorological Office, warning the coasts likely to be affected. When the\r\ncone is hoisted with its apex downwards, it means that strong south or\r\nsouth-west winds are to be looked for. When the cone is hoisted with its\r\napex upwards, it indicates that strong winds from the north or north-east\r\nare expected. Of course they are merely useful precautions; but they are\r\nuniversally attended to by people on the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nThough one may have reasonable doubts about the use that can be made of\r\nweather forecasts for three days, such as are now regularly issued, on\r\naccount of the finical, coy, spasmodic interludes on short notice, yet\r\nthere is a wonderful certainty in the daily prognostics of the direction\r\nand strength of the wind, the temperature of the air, and the likelihood\r\nof rainy or fair weather, dependent on the broad uniformity of nature.\r\nThis is very serviceable for people who have now to live at high pressure\r\nin business, in the enthralling days of keen competition. And it is a\r\ngreat boon to those who are in search of health by travelling, or who, in\r\ninnocent pleasure, desire to live as much as possible in the open air.\r\nVery little credit is given to the \"gas\" of the isolated \"weather\r\nprophet\"; but those who have confidence in the usual weather forecasts\r\nfrom the Meteorological Office are satisfied in their belief; and those\r\nwho, in self-confidence, ignore all weather prognostics, are still weak\r\nenough to read them and act up to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn practical meteorology, in the
