As early as 1886, Dr. Förstemann recognized this series as an\r\nimportant one, and one which probably referred to the moon in some way.\r\nEach page is divided into an upper and a lower half designated,\r\nrespectively, “a” and “b.” Pages 51a and 52a form a unit in themselves,\r\nbut are clearly associated with the remaining pages. The probable\r\nmeaning of this group is still so doubtful that it has been deemed best\r\nto omit entirely a discussion of it at the present time. The remaining\r\nsections of these pages form one long series of numbers which should be\r\nread from left to right, beginning at 53a, reading to 58a, continuing on\r\n51b, and ending the series at 58b.\r\n\r\nEach half-page is divided, horizontally, into four sections. The upper\r\nsection consists of two rows of hieroglyphs. The section just below it\r\ncontains a series of black numbers which increase in value from left to\r\nright. The third section consists of three rows of day glyphs with red\r\nnumbers attached to them. The interval between the glyphs in successive\r\nrows can, of course, be mathematically obtained. The last, and bottom,\r\ndivision of the page is filled with a series of black numbers which are\r\nof three values only, namely, 177, 148, and 178, of which the first is\r\nthe most frequent. At more or less regular intervals a vertical strip is\r\nrun from the top of the half-page to the bottom. This strip contains, in\r\nthe upper part, eight or ten glyphs. Below them in all but the first\r\nstrip is a constellation band, and below that a figure of some kind.\r\nThese strips divide the number series into groups, and are called\r\n“pictures,” occurring on ten of the fourteen half-pages. Considered\r\nvertically the pages are composed of columns. Each column contains,\r\nbeginning at the top, two hieroglyphs, a long number, three day glyphs,\r\nand their numbers, and finally, at the bottom, a short number. The\r\npictures occur between these columns.\r\n\r\nThe series covers a period of 11,960 days, although the last number\r\nrecorded in the upper series is only 11,958. By means of the columns\r\nthis period of 11,960 days is divided into 69 unequal parts. Let columns\r\n2, 3, and 4 on page 54b be taken as examples. Then each column in the\r\nseries should be read in the following manner:[1] The lower number of\r\ncolumn 3 is 8.17 or 177. Add this number to the upper number of column\r\n2, which is 1. 2. 11. 9 or 8149. The result is 8326 which is expressed\r\ncorrectly as 1. 3. 2. 6 in the upper number of column 3. The lower\r\nnumber should also be added to the upper day glyph of column 2, which is\r\n10 Caban, giving 5 Ix, which is the day glyph and number appearing as\r\nthe first in column 3. The second day glyph and number is that of the\r\nday following 5 Ix, namely 6 Men. Similarly, 7 Cib is the day after 6\r\nMen. Going through the same process for column 4, 148, that is, the\r\nlower number 7. 8 of that column, should be added to 8326 to obtain\r\n8474, which is expressed in the upper number of column 4 as 1. 3. 9. 14.\r\nLikewise, 148 days after 5 Ix comes 10 Ik, which is the upper day glyph\r\nof column 4, and below which are found the two days immediately\r\nfollowing, namely, 11 Akbal and 12 Kan.\r\n\r\n  [1] For those unacquainted with Maya arithmetic the following points\r\n      will explain matters: the Mayas used the vigesimal system of\r\n      enumeration; they counted by twenties instead of tens. A bar\r\n      represented five, and a dot stood for one. They represented\r\n      numbers larger than twenty by position, just as we do. However,\r\n      instead of having the smallest denomination at the right and the\r\n      largest at the left of a horizontal series of figures, they had\r\n      the smallest at the bottom and the largest at the top of a column\r\n      of numbers. Instead of each unit in a given position representing\r\n      ten times the value of that of the preceding position, it\r\n      represented twenty times the value, except in the third position\r\n      where it was only eighteen times as great. Thus each unit of the\r\n      bottom number represented one (Kin), that of the number above it\r\n      twenty (Uinal), that of the third number 20 × 18 or 360 (Tun),\r\n      that of the fourth position 20 × 360 or 7200 (Katun), etc. For\r\n      ease in handling, these numbers are written in our script with\r\n      arabic numerals, the bottom number on the right, and separated by\r\n      periods. Thus in column three, page 53a, the upper number is\r\n      1. 7. 2, which means that the kin of this group is 2, the Uinal 7,\r\n      (7 × 20) and the Tun 1 (1 × 360), making in all 2 + 140 + 360 or\r\n      502.\r\n\r\n      The Maya calendar, like ours, consisted of a series of numbers and\r\n      a series of names for each day, each series repeating itself\r\n      constantly, irrespective of the other. There were twenty different\r\n      day names, which remained in an unchangeable order, and thirteen\r\n      numbers. In the pages under discussion these day names appear as\r\n      glyphs preceded by the necessary number.\r\n\r\n      For further details consult S. G. Morley, _An Introduction to\r\n      Maya Hieroglyphs_, Bulletin 57, Bureau of American Ethnology,\r\n      Washington, D. C., 1915, and C. P. Bowditch, 1910.\r\n\r\nIn short, then, the ideal arrangement of the series is as follows: Each\r\nupper number is the sum of all the lower numbers of the preceding\r\ncolumns and its own column. Each lower number expresses the difference\r\nbetween the upper number of its own column and that of the column\r\nimmediately preceding it. The day names and numbers are three horizontal\r\nseries, each starting a day later than the one above it, and recording\r\nthree sets of day names and numbers which would fit the series formed by\r\nthe upper numbers. It should be noticed that the mathematical\r\ninterpretation of the series does not appear to depend in any way upon\r\nthe hieroglyphs appearing at the top of the columns, or upon the\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThis series deals quite clearly with synodical revolutions of the moon.\r\nThe entire series records 11,960 days, although the last number in the\r\nupper series is only 11,958, a condition that will be explained later.\r\nFour hundred and five synodical revolutions of the moon consume,\r\naccording to modern astronomy, 11,959.889 days, or about .11 of a day\r\nless than the length of the series. Moreover, the difference groups 148,\r\n177, and 178 which separate the upper numbers, also record synodical\r\nmonths, for five months consume 147.65 days, and six months 177.18 days.\r\nIn fact the correspondence between the numbers in the series and the\r\nsynodical months is so exact, that nowhere does an error of more than\r\none day exist.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Bowditch, 1910, pp. 222, 223.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the ideal arrangement given above is not followed exactly.\r\nThe actual series as it occurs in the manuscript appears to be full of\r\nerrors, a list of which will be found in Table I, p. 4. Most of these\r\nerrors have been pointed out and discussed repeatedly.[3] There still\r\nexists some doubt as to which numbers should be considered errors of the\r\noriginal writer and which should be taken at their face value. For this\r\nreason the errors are here discussed in some detail, for in some cases\r\nthe errors, or supposed errors, affect theories in regard to the series.\r\n\r\n  [3] By Dr. Förstemann, Dr. Thomas, and Mr. Bowditch.\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nAPPARENT IRREGULARITIES\r\n\r\n  Lower number series:\r\n\r\n      Absence of all 178’s that occur in upper series.\r\n      Column 23.

In the centre of the table are three columns containing the\r\nactual table. The third column contains the uncorrected upper number;\r\nthe fourth the lower number; and the fifth the first day sign and its\r\nnumber. Since the other two day series agree, except in a very few cases\r\nwhich will be mentioned later, with the first series, they have been\r\nomitted from the table. The sixth column contains the day signs as they\r\nprobably should occur, and the second contains the corrected upper\r\nnumber. The first column gives the pages of the manuscript and the\r\nnumber of the columns on each in order to facilitate reference to the\r\nmanuscript. Each column of Table II, with the exception of the first and\r\nfourth, is composed of two series of numbers, since each interval\r\nbetween the numbers of the manuscript has been placed in parentheses\r\nafter the last of the pair of numbers it deals with, in order to\r\nfacilitate comparison with the lower numbers. The names and numbers in\r\nthe fifth column which have parentheses have been obliterated in the\r\nmanuscript, but are easily inferred from the other two rows of day signs\r\nand numbers.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent irregularity is the absence of the number 178 in the\r\nlower numbers when the differences in both the day series and the upper\r\nnumbers show that 178 should be the difference. This occurs in columns\r\n7, 14, 29, 37, 52 and 60 of the manuscript. The only place in which 178\r\ndoes occur in the lower number is in column 23, when it agrees with the\r\ndifference in the day series, but not with that of the upper number. In\r\nother words, the six occurrences of the 178-day group in the upper\r\nnumbers are neglected in the lower numbers, and the only occurrence of\r\n178 in the lower numbers does not agree with the upper numbers. This\r\nimplies that it is of deeper significance than a mere error. There is\r\nanother disagreement between the upper and lower numbers which could\r\nvery well be the result of carelessness. In column 26, the lower number\r\nis 177, while both the upper number and the day series give a difference\r\nof 148. This is the only case in which the differences of 148 are not\r\nfound at the same place in all series, and, consequently, is probably an\r\nerror of the scribe. Again in the lower number of column 50, the\r\ncareless omission of one dot in the Uinal place has resulted in the\r\nrecord of 157 instead of the correct number, 177.\r\n\r\nWith one exception all of the errors in the upper numbers occur in the\r\nfirst third of the series. That exception, i.e., the writing of 4164 for\r\n4163 in the column 24, may be explained by the fact that the writer of\r\nthe series had just added in column 23 the extra day to the day series,\r\nwhich threw it out of agreement with the upper numbers. For the moment\r\nthis fact slipped his mind, but he corrected the mistake by subtracting\r\none day from the difference between the upper numbers of columns 24 and\r\n25.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE II\r\n\r\n   (1)        (2)          (3)     (4)        (5)                (6)\r\n   Page    Corrected  Uncorrected\r\n   and       upper       upper     Lower    Uncorrected        Corrected\r\n  Column    number      number    number     day signs         day signs\r\n            0                                             11 Manik\r\n  53a  1   177 (177)   157         177   6 Kan             6 Kan      (177)\r\n       2   354 (177)   353 (196)   177   1 Imix     (177)  1 Imix     (177)\r\n       3   502 (148)   502 (149)   148   6 Muluc    (148)  6 Muluc    (148)\r\n\r\n                                    PICTURE\r\n\r\n       4   679 (177)   674 (172)   177   1 Cimi     (177)  1 Cimi     (177)\r\n       5   856 (177)   856 (182)   177   9 Akbal    (177)  9 Akbal    (177)\r\n       6  1034 (178)  1033 (177)   177   4 (Ahau)   (177)  5 Imix     (178)\r\n  54a  7  1211 (177)  1211 (178)   177 (13) Enzab   (178) 13 Enzab    (177)\r\n       8  1388 (177)  1388 (177)   177   8  Men     (177)  8 Men      (177)\r\n       9  1565 (177)  1565 (177)   177   3  Eb      (177)  3 Eb       (177)\r\n      10  1742 (177)  1748 (183)   177  11  Muluc   (177) 11 Muluc    (177)\r\n      11  1919 (177)  1919 (171)   177   6  Cib     ( 47)  6 Cimi     (177)\r\n      12  2096 (177)  2016 ( 97)   177   1  Akbal   (307)  1 Akbal    (177)\r\n      13  2244 (148)  2244 (288)   148   6  Chuen   (148)  6 Chuen    (148)\r\n\r\n  55a                               PICTURE\r\n\r\n      14  2422 (178)  3142 (898)   177   2  Muluc   (178)  2 Muluc    (178)\r\n      15  2599 (177)  2598 (-544)  177  10  Cimi    (177) 10 Cimi     (177)\r\n      16  2776 (177)  2776 (178)   177   5  Akbal   (177)  5 Akbal    (177)\r\n      17  2953 (177)  2953 (177)   177  13  Ahau    (177) 13 Ahau     (177)\r\n      18  3130 (177)  3130 (177)   177   8  ?          ?   8 Caban    (177)\r\n  56a 19  3278 (148)  3278 (148)   148   ?

This number shows a very clear case of erasure. The\r\nwriter of this section of the manuscript in copying from the older\r\nsource, at first overlooked column 14, and placed 7.3.18, the upper\r\nnumber in column 15 in this place. Realizing his mistake he erased the\r\nthree dots in the Uinal place, but utilized two of the bars and the\r\nthree dots in the Kin place as the 13 needed in the Uinal in column 14,\r\nand erased the lower bar of the original 18. This procedure of the\r\nwriter’s threw the upper number of column 14 out of alignment, for the\r\ntwo dots of the Kin appear below the 13, somewhat below the line of Kins\r\nof the other columns. The seven in the Tun place should have been a six,\r\nso the scribe inserted an extra dot between the two of the original 7,\r\nneglecting, however, to erase the other two dots. As a result the upper\r\nnumber of column 14 records the number 3142, which is 720 greater than\r\nit should be, namely, 2422.\r\n\r\nIn column 10, 1748 was recorded instead of 1742, for a bar and three\r\ndots were written in the Kin place instead of only two dots. This is a\r\nvery peculiar and unexpected form of carelessness, which is, however,\r\ncorrected in the next column. The remaining irregularities in the upper\r\nnumbers are all due to the omission of a part of the number. In columns\r\n2 and 15, one dot was omitted in the Kin place, thus recording 353\r\ninstead of 354 in the former, and 2598 instead of 2599 in the latter. In\r\ncolumn 4 one bar was omitted in the Kin place, making the number 674,\r\nfive less than it should be, namely, 679. In column 1, one dot was\r\nomitted in the Uinal place, and in column 12, four dots of the same\r\ndenomination, recording, respectively, 157 and 2016 instead of 177 and\r\n2096.\r\n\r\nThere is only one decided error in the day series. In column 11, 6 Cib,\r\n7 Caban, 8 Eznab were written instead of 6 Cimi, 7 Manik, 8 Lamat. It\r\nshould be noticed that the number of the day was right. In fact just\r\none-half a tonalamatl, or 130 days, was dropped before the day series of\r\ncolumn 11, and added on again immediately afterwards. This is an\r\nextremely curious error to make in calculating and may shed some light\r\non the way in which the Mayas reckoned.\r\n\r\nThe five remaining irregularities in the day series are of two kinds. In\r\ncolumn 5, the number preceding the third day, Chicchan, is 4 instead of\r\n11. Apparently the writer of the manuscript forgot for the moment that\r\nthe day was added to the one above it and not the one to the left, and\r\nwrote 4 because the number associated with the third day sign of column\r\n4 was 3. The same mistake was made in the third day of column 36, except\r\nthat in this case it was the day sign and not the number which was\r\nconfused. Here, instead of writing Ahau, which followed the Cauac in\r\nthe second series, Ben was recorded because the sign to the left was Eb.\r\nThe other three irregularities are all due to carelessness in placing\r\nsufficient dots in the number associated with the day sign, for in\r\ncolumns 17, 47 and 49, 1 Ik, 10 Eznab and 11 Kan were recorded,\r\nrespectively, instead of the necessary 2 Ik, 11 Eznab and 12 Kan.\r\n\r\nThere are two places in which columns seem to be misplaced, although the\r\nmathematics of the series at these points is correct as it stands. For\r\nthe sake of uniformity in the arrangement of the difference groups, the\r\n178-day group of column 7 should occur in column 6, and for the same\r\nreason, the 148-day group of column 58 should occur in column 59.\r\nProfessor Förstemann calls both of these variations errors, and arranges\r\nhis version of the table so that each part is just like the other two.\r\nHe gives no reason for his opinion other than the phrase “for the author\r\n[of the manuscript] had confused the differences 178 and 148....”[4] Mr.\r\nBowditch, on the other hand, allows both of the variations to stand as\r\nthey appear in the manuscript, and quite rightly holds the opinion that,\r\n“It may possibly be that these numbers thus placed are errors of the\r\nscribe, but the mere plea for uniformity is not sufficient to lead us to\r\nmake these changes.”[5]\r\n\r\n  [4] Förstemann, 1901, p. 123.\r\n\r\n  [5] Bowditch, 1910, p. 217.\r\n\r\nIn Table II the apparent mistake in columns 58 and 59 remains as it\r\noccurs in the manuscript, for the reason which Mr. Bowditch gives. In\r\nthe case of columns 6 and 7 there seems to be some evidence that there\r\nactually was an error made. The last column on page 53a, which is the\r\none under discussion, contains no day glyph in the first day series. The\r\nglyph should have been that of Ahau. There is distinct evidence, altho\r\nvery faint, that a glyph was once there. Moreover, the smooth coating\r\nwhich covered the material of the manuscript page is not broken. There\r\nare other obliterated glyphs in these pages of the manuscript, but few\r\nin which the surface, although unbroken, still contains a faint, almost\r\ncontinuous outline of a glyph. The glyph, then, was probably erased. The\r\nwriter of the manuscript had probably completely finished column 6 and\r\nstarted column 7 before he detected the error. He began to erase the\r\npart that was wrong, then realized what an amount of alteration would be\r\nnecessary, and finally compromised by making the difference come between\r\ncolumns 6 and 7 instead of columns 5 and 6. This hypothesis in regard\r\nto the manner in which the erasure was done may be wrong, but the\r\nerasure still stands as a strong evidence to show that the 178 should\r\nhave occurred in column 6 rather than after it.\r\n\r\nFinally there appears to be an error in the totals of the series, for\r\nthe upper number series records as a total 11,958 days and the day\r\nseries 11,959 days, although there is strong reason for believing that\r\nthe series should record 11,960 days. This discrepancy in the totals\r\nwill be referred to again.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, the apparent irregularities in the manuscript fall\r\ninto two great classes, those which are corrected in the next column or\r\nare easily detected because of their disagreement with the record in the\r\nother two series, and those which are not obviously due to carelessness.\r\nThe latter will be considered under the solutions. The former may be\r\ndismissed as clerical errors not affecting the solution. In this group\r\nare two of the irregularities in the lower numbers (columns 26 and 50),\r\nand all eight in the upper numbers, seven of which occur in the first\r\nthird of the manuscript. The six errors in the day series, and the\r\ntransposition of columns 6 and 7, also belong in this class.\r\n\r\nBy referring to Table II it will be noticed that the pictures occur\r\nafter the 148-day groups in each case. The upper numbers immediately\r\npreceding the pictures are given in Table III (p. 11), together with the\r\ndifferences between them. By grouping these differences, it becomes\r\napparent that the pictures may be divided into three large groups of\r\n3986 days; two out of the three containing the same difference numbers,\r\n1742, 1034, and 1210. If, in the last group, the number 10,039 were\r\nchanged to 10,216 by adding 177, the differences for this group would\r\nalso read as the others, when the end of the series and the beginning of\r\nthe series are added together (708 + 502 = 1210), for the 10th picture\r\nis, in a sense, out of the grouping since it occurs after the last\r\nnumber in the series. The 148-day groups are arranged in the same order\r\nfor they occur in the same columns as the numbers used above.\r\n\r\nBy applying the same process to the 178-day groups, it is found that\r\nthey also can be divided into groups which contain 3986 days. In this\r\ncase the second and third groups contain the same numbers, 2598 and 1388\r\n(Table IV). If the number 1211 in the first group is changed to 1034 by\r\nsubtracting 177, the last number of this group would be 1388; and the\r\nfirst number 2598 could be formed by adding the remainder at both ends\r\nof the series (1564 + 1034 = 2598).\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered at this point that the only column in which the\r\nlower numbers contained 178 is column 23, of which the upper number is\r\n3986. This gives further grounds for dividing the series as it stands\r\ninto three parts of 3986 days, each containing 23 columns.\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\nUPPER NUMBERS OF 148-DAY GROUPS\r\n\r\n   Number    Difference     Group\r\n      (0)\r\n              502\r\n     502\r\n             1742  \\\r\n    2244           |\r\n             1034  |         3986\r\n    3278           |\r\n             1210  /\r\n    4488\r\n             1742  \\\r\n    6230           |\r\n             1034  |         3986\r\n    7264           |\r\n             1210  /\r\n    8474\r\n             1565  \\\r\n   10039           |\r\n             1211  |\r\n   11250           |         3986\r\n              708  |\r\n  (11958)          |\r\n             (502) /\r\n\r\nTABLE IV\r\n\r\nUPPER NUMBERS OF 178-DAY GROUPS\r\n\r\n   Number    Difference     Group\r\n              (1564) \\\r\n      (0)            |\r\n               1211  |      3986\r\n    1211             |\r\n               1211  /\r\n    2422\r\n               2598  \\\r\n    5020             |      3986\r\n               1388  /\r\n    6408\r\n               2598  \\\r\n    9006             |      3986\r\n               1388  /\r\n   10394\r\n               1564\r\n  (11958)\r\n\r\nThe three parts are not exactly alike, however, as has already been\r\npointed out in considering the probable errors. If the upper numbers and\r\nday numbers in column 6 should be altered, so that the difference 178\r\nmight occur in that column instead of column 7, and if, by the same\r\nprocess, the difference of 148 could occur in column 59 instead of 58,\r\nthen the three parts of the series would be entirely alike. The three\r\nfacts mentioned are, however, very strong evidence for supposing that\r\nthe people who used this table considered it as consisting of three\r\nequal parts.\r\n\r\nThis series in the Dresden is very similar to other pages of the Dresden\r\nand other manuscripts, two examples of which are given as illustrations.\r\nOne of the most interesting parallels is the series on pages 46-50 of\r\nthis same manuscript. This series covers a period of 2920 days which is\r\ndivided into 20 unequal subdivisions. On page 24, which just precedes\r\npage 46, this number is used as a unit in multiplication, that is, the\r\nnumbers occurring on page 24 are separated from each other by 2920 or\r\nmultiples of this number. On pages 44b and 45b the number 78 is divided\r\ninto four unequal parts, and on pages 43b and 44b it is used as a unit\r\nin a series which finally reaches the number 1940 × 78.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe first references to these pages in the manuscript were concerned\r\nchiefly with the reading of the numbers without any theories in regard\r\nto the probable meaning of the series.\r\n\r\nDr. Förstemann, in 1886, was probably the first to mention these pages\r\nspecifically. At this time he corrected many of the errors in the\r\nseries, and related the rows of days to the number series.[6] He had\r\nalready recognized a close relation between the difference between the\r\n1st and 9th pictures, i.e., 10,748, and the Saturn sidereal period of\r\n10,753 days. Of course, in order to do this he had also identified the\r\nvarious signs in the “constellation bands,” assigning them to various\r\nplanets.[7] These identifications are based on little more than the wish\r\nhe had that they might be those planets, and for that reason they are\r\nseriously open to doubt.\r\n\r\n  [6] Förstemann, 1886, p. 34.\r\n\r\n  [7] Ibid., pp. 68-71.\r\n\r\nCyrus Thomas, two years later, also discussed this series at some\r\nlength, but confined his considerations entirely to the mathematical\r\nside of the work. He also pointed out most of the errors, agreeing in\r\nthe main with Förstemann. He considered that the series contained 11,960\r\ndays. In his conclusion he said “the sum of the series as shown by the\r\nnumbers over the second column of Plate 58b is 33 years, 3 months, and\r\n18 days. As this includes only the top day of this column (10 Cimi), we\r\nmust add two days to complete the series, which ends with 12 Lamat.”[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] Thomas, 1888, p, 325.\r\n\r\nDuring the following years, Dr. Förstemann repeatedly referred to these\r\npages in his publications and, in 1898, published an article devoted to\r\nthese pages alone.[9] The most detailed as well as the final discussion\r\nof these pages is that given in his book on the Dresden Codex.[10] In\r\npages 53-58, and 51b and 52b he recognizes the similarity to pages\r\n46-50, and remarks that the Mayas not only combined the _tonalamatl_\r\nand the Mercury year, but also attempted to bring the lunar revolution\r\ninto accord with these two. In other words, Förstemann seems to imply\r\nthat the primary purpose of the series was the counting of the Mercury\r\nyears, and that the lunar part of the problem was secondary.\r\n\r\n  [9] Förstemann, 1898.\r\n\r\n  [10] Ibid., 1901, pp. 118-133.\r\n\r\nHe explains the number 11,958 as the result of attempts to make the\r\nlunar count agree with 11,960. “They [the Mayas] found that 405 lunar\r\nrevolutions amounted approximately to 11,958 days, which is, in fact,\r\nthe largest number on the second half page of page 58.”[11] This will\r\nnot stand at all as the reason for the 11,958 since 405 lunar\r\nrevolutions come to 11,959.889 days, and if the Mayas knew the\r\nrevolutions accurately enough to know when to intercalate a day, they\r\nmost certainly would not have intentionally formed the number 11,958,\r\nwhen they were perfectly well aware of the fact that the time was more\r\nthan 11,959 days. He recognizes in the numbers 177, 148 and 178\r\nmultiples of lunar months of 29 and 30 days.\r\n\r\n  [11] Förstemann, 1901, p. 121.\r\n\r\nDr. Förstemann at this time divides the series into the three equal\r\ndivisions in which it has since been considered. These are of 3986 days,\r\nthus causing the intercalated days to come at the same time in all\r\nthree.[12] He also divided each of these three divisions into three\r\nunequal groups of 1742, 1034, and 1210 days each. He advances theories,\r\nbased on the positions of the pictures in the series, to show that the\r\nseries also referred to the siderial periods of Saturn and Jupiter, and\r\ndiscusses the meaning of the glyphs found on these pages.\r\n\r\n  [12] Ibid., p. 123.\r\n\r\nThis detailed discussion by Dr. Förstemann of pages 51-58 of the Dresden\r\nhas been used as a foundation by many in further studies of these\r\npages. It is highly probable, however, that a careful study of his\r\ninterpretations will have to be made, in which the proved assumptions\r\nmust be clearly differentiated from those in which the “wish is father\r\nto the thought.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch, in 1910,[13] discussed these pages and their relation to\r\nthe astronomical knowledge of the Mayas. He divided the series into the\r\nsame groups as Dr. Förstemann, basing his division upon the pictures\r\nwhich occur in every case immediately after the number 148.[14] Mr.\r\nBowditch brought out very clearly that this series is a lunar series,\r\nby means of a table which compares the numbers recorded in the\r\nmanuscript and the multiples of true lunations.[15] There can be no\r\nquestion on this point, for the difference between the recorded days and\r\nthe true lunations is never more than .9 of a day. He also pointed out a\r\nway in which this series could be used over and over again in the form\r\nof a cycle,[16] and then discussed the relation of this series to the\r\nSaturn and Mercury periods, disagreeing with Förstemann on several\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n  [13] Bowditch, 1910, pp. 211-231.\r\n\r\n  [14] Ibid., p. 218.\r\n\r\n  [15] Bowditch, 1910, pp. 222, 223.\r\n\r\n  [16] Ibid., p. 224.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch also pointed out a peculiar coincidence between the\r\nsynodical revolutions of Jupiter and the numbers in the series, but\r\nbased his argument on quite different material from the similar theory\r\nof Dr. Förstemann’s. The important fact brought out is that the three\r\nparts of the series under discussion are almost exactly equal to 10\r\nrevolutions of Jupiter, for one revolution of Jupiter consumes 398.867\r\ndays.[17] “This would give a reason for the selection of 11,958 to\r\n11,960 days or 405 revolutions, and for the division of this number into\r\nthree sections of 3986 days each.”[18]\r\n\r\n  [17] Ibid., pp. 229, 230.\r\n\r\n  [18] Ibid., p. 231.\r\n\r\nDr. Förstemann and Mr. Bowditch differ in regard to some of the\r\ncorrections which should be made in the manuscript, but on the whole the\r\ntwo discussions of these pages supplement one another. The general\r\nconclusion to be drawn from them is that these pages of the Dresden are\r\nclosely associated with the synodical lunar month, and possibly, with\r\nthe synodical revolution of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThree years after Mr. Bowditch’s discussion, Mr. Meinshausen published\r\nan article in which the relation of this series to eclipses was first\r\nbrought out.[19] He compared, by means of two tables, recorded eclipses\r\nof the 18th and 19th centuries with the numbers in the Dresden Codex.\r\nOut of the 69 dates in the manuscript all but 15 dates agreed with the\r\nfirst case, and, in the second, all but 13, due to the fact that all the\r\neclipses are not visible at one place on the earth’s surface. “Another\r\nindication that the numbers in the codex have arisen from the\r\nobservation of eclipses lies in the fact that the exact grouping of the\r\nnumbers which is induced by the insertion of pictures in the number\r\nperiods is also possible in lunar eclipses which are visible at one\r\nparticular point.”[20] In the table given to uphold this statement, the\r\nnumbers, to be sure, can be grouped in the manner which he suggests; but\r\nthey can also be grouped in other series. In his opinion the reason for\r\nthe grouping “lies in the close proximity of a solar eclipse to a lunar\r\neclipse,”[21] that is, that at the date at which the pictures are\r\ninserted a solar eclipse occurred 15 days either before or after a lunar\r\neclipse. There are two facts which tend to uphold this theory. One is\r\nthe occurrence of the sun and the moon in shields over nearly all\r\npictures, which he interprets as “signs of solar and lunar eclipses”;\r\nthe other is the series of dates on pages 51a and 52a, which are 15 days\r\napart. In a table of recorded eclipses proof is given that such double\r\neclipses can occur at the intervals which separate the pictures in the\r\nmanuscript. Since these intervals vary a great deal, Meinshausen\r\nbelieves that they will form the means of identifying the specific\r\neclipses recorded in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n  [19] Meinshausen, 1913, pp. 221-227.\r\n\r\n  [20] Ibid., p. 225.\r\n\r\n  [21] Meinshausen, 1913, p. 225.\r\n\r\nHis general conclusion is that “the material advanced will prove\r\nsufficiently that these numbers are associated in some way with solar\r\nand lunar eclipses, and this explanation must remain standing at least\r\nuntil other numbers, corresponding equally remarkably, are found.”[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Ibid., pp. 226, 227.\r\n\r\nProfessor R. W. Willson of the Astronomical Department of Harvard\r\nUniversity, working on a similar theory at about the same time, had\r\nfound, however, that no series of solar eclipses corresponding to the\r\nintervals of the pictures in the text was visible in Yucatan between the\r\nChristian era and the time of the Spanish conquest.[23] This apparently\r\ninvalidates Meinshausen’s theory.\r\n\r\n  [23] Professor Willson’s work on the Dresden manuscript has not yet\r\n       been published. It is referred to here only through his kind\r\n       permission.\r\n\r\nProfessor Willson believes that the table in the manuscript indicates\r\nthe days of ecliptic conjunction (that is, New Moon occurring so near\r\nthe moon’s node that eclipses _may_ occur) and, as Mr. Bowditch has\r\nshown, with a high degree of accuracy. Sufficient proof of this, in\r\nProfessor Willson’s opinion, is the close correspondence of the\r\nintervals of the codex with the intervals of Schram’s lunar table.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Schram, 1908, pp. 358, 359.\r\n\r\nThe similarity between the numbers in the Dresden and Schram’s table is\r\nso remarkable that it seems advisable to point out some of the most\r\noutstanding features. In addition to giving the days of multiples of the\r\nlunar synodic months, this table also gives the time of possible\r\noccurrences of both solar and lunar eclipses. Eclipses occur in cycles,\r\nthe best known of which is the Saros, although there are also smaller\r\ncycles which are not so accurate. Table V (p. 17) gives the occurrences\r\nof central solar eclipses according to Schram. It should be noticed that\r\nthey occur in groups of threes and fours, each set being separated from\r\nthe preceding one by 29 synodical months. The numbers in each group are\r\nonly six months apart. Table VI (p. 17) is a corresponding series of\r\nlunar eclipses, which also occur in a grouping similar to that of the\r\nsolar eclipses. It should be noticed in passing that the first numbers\r\nof these groups, in both the solar and lunar eclipses are separated by\r\n47 and 41 lunations, the latter occurring after every third group in\r\nTable V.\r\n\r\nTable VII (p. 17) contains the numbers which are in the same columns as\r\nthe 178-day groups in the Dresden. By comparing Table V and Table VII,\r\nit will be found that the numbers in the Dresden are the same as the\r\nfirst numbers in groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the solar eclipses. In\r\nthe last two numbers there is a difference of one day, which is\r\nexplained by recalling the addition of an extra day in the day series\r\nbut not in the upper numbers of the Dresden. If 679 days are added to\r\neach number in Table VII, which amounts to the same thing as advancing\r\nthe Dresden table 679 days with respect to Schram’s table, it will be\r\nfound that these numbers will also agree with the first numbers in\r\ngroups 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 and with the second number in group 9 of the\r\nlunar eclipses, in Table VI. A similar agreement may be observed for the\r\n148-day groups (see Table III).\r\n\r\nThis remarkable agreement between the 178-day groups in the Dresden and\r\nthe occurrences of eclipses may have several meanings. (1) One\r\npossibility, and one which should always be kept in mind, is that this\r\nagreement is simply another coincidence, of which there are always many\r\nin chronological work. (2) It may be that the numbers refer to dates of\r\nprophesied eclipses which the Mayas had learned occurred at more or less\r\nregular intervals. (3) Since this table has a place in the calendar of\r\nthe Mayas (for a date probably occurs on page 52a), it may be that these\r\nnumbers refer to definite historical eclipses. If they do, they will\r\nafford a means by which an absolute correlation between the Maya and\r\nthe Julian calendars may be obtained. Professor Willson is at present\r\nworking on this problem.\r\n\r\nTABLE V\r\n\r\nSOLAR ECLIPSES\r\n\r\n  Group   Eclipse    Month\r\n          /  1034      35\r\n    1     |  1211      41\r\n          |  1388      47\r\n          \\  1565      53\r\n          /  2422      82\r\n    2     |  2599      88\r\n          |  2776      94\r\n          \\  2953     100\r\n          /  3632     123\r\n    3     |  3809     129\r\n          |  3987     135\r\n          \\  4164     141\r\n          /  5020     170\r\n    4     |  5197     176\r\n          |  5375     182\r\n          \\  5552     188\r\n          /  6408     217\r\n    5     |  6585     223\r\n          \\  6762     229\r\n          /  7619     258\r\n    6     |  7796     264\r\n          |  7973     270\r\n          \\  8150     276\r\n          /  9007     305\r\n    7     |  9184     311\r\n          |  9361     317\r\n          \\  9538     323\r\n          / 10395     352\r\n    8     | 10572     358\r\n          \\ 10750     364\r\n          / 11606     393\r\n    9     | 11783     399\r\n          \\ 11960     405\r\n\r\nTABLE VI\r\n\r\nLUNAR ECLIPSES\r\n\r\n  Group   Eclipse    Month\r\n          /   502      17\r\n    1     |   679      23\r\n          \\   856      29\r\n          /  1713      58\r\n    2     |  1890      64\r\n          |  2067      70\r\n          \\  2244      76\r\n          /  3101     105\r\n    3     |  3278     111\r\n          \\  3455     117\r\n          /  4311     146\r\n    4     |  4489     152\r\n          |  4666     158\r\n          \\  4843     164\r\n          /  5699     193\r\n    5     |  5877     199\r\n          |  6054     205\r\n          \\  6231     211\r\n          /  7087     240\r\n    6     |  7264     246\r\n          \\  7442     252\r\n          /  8298     281\r\n    7     |  8475     287\r\n          |  8652     293\r\n          \\  8830     299\r\n          /  9686     328\r\n    8     |  9863     334\r\n          \\ 10040     340\r\n          / 10896     369\r\n    9     | 11074     375\r\n          | 11251     381\r\n          \\ 11428     387\r\n\r\nTABLE VII\r\n\r\n178-DAY GROUPS\r\n\r\n  Number    Month\r\n\r\n   1034       35\r\n   2422       82\r\n   5020      170\r\n   6408      217\r\n   9006      305\r\n  10394      352\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the exact extent to which the eclipse seasons\r\naffect these pages in the Dresden Codex it is necessary to work out in\r\nas great detail as possible the calendar represented.\r\n\r\nModern astronomy shows that the synodical revolution of the moon\r\nconsumes 29.53059 days, about .03 days more than 29-1/2 days. Since a\r\ncalendar must be based on whole days the natural method of combining the\r\nmonths would be to alternate one of 29 days with one of 30 days. At the\r\nend of two months or 59 days the true synodical month would be in\r\nadvance of the calendrical month by .06118 days. Every two months this\r\nerror is doubled so that at the end of 34 months the calendar would have\r\ncompleted 1003 days and the synodical month 1004.04 days. (See Table\r\nVIII, p. 19.) One method of correcting this would be to make the last\r\nmonth a 30-day month instead of one of 29 days as it would be by simple\r\nalternation. This 34-month period could then be repeated as a cycle with\r\nan accumulating error of .04 days at every repetition.\r\n\r\nSuch a series utterly disregards, however, all other phenomena such as\r\neclipses, seasons, etc. As soon as eclipses are considered the\r\narrangement of the months must be altered in order to use the\r\nperiodicity of eclipses in the calendar. Eclipses occur at regular\r\nseasons, approximately six months apart. The average interval between\r\neclipse seasons is 173.310 days, 3.874 days less than six synodical\r\nlunar months. In Table IX (p. 20) the eclipse season is compared with\r\nthe nearest synodical lunar month. It will be noticed that the\r\ndifference increases between the two series until it is necessary to use\r\nfive synodical months for one interval instead of six to keep the\r\ndifference less than half a month. It is necessary to do this three\r\ntimes in 135 synodical months, or 3986.630 days, which exceed 23 eclipse\r\nseasons, or 3986.131 days, by practically one half-day. It would be most\r\nlogical to drop these extra months out of the set of six, during that\r\ngroup in which the difference tends to become most nearly half a month.\r\nThat would be just before the 23d, 70th, and 117th month, that is, 47\r\nmonths apart, requiring 41 months to complete the 135-month period.\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII\r\n\r\n  Number of   Number of        Elapsed days      Elapsed days\r\n   month     days in month    calendar month    synodical month   Error\r\n     1            30                  30              29.53         -.47\r\n     2            29                  59              59.06          .06\r\n     3            30                  89              88.59         -.41\r\n     4            29                 118             118.12          .12\r\n     5            30                 148             147.65         -.35\r\n     6            29                 177             177.18          .18\r\n     7            30                 207             206.71         -.29\r\n     8            29                 236             236.24          .24\r\n     9            30                 266             265.78         -.22\r\n    10            29                 295             295.31          .31\r\n    11            30                 325             324.84         -.16\r\n    12            29                 354             354.37          .37\r\n    13            30                 384             383.90         -.10\r\n    14            29                 413             413.43          .43\r\n    15            30                 443             442.96         -.04\r\n    16            29                 472             472.49          .49\r\n    17            30                 502             502.02          .02\r\n    18            29                 531             531.55          .55\r\n    19            30                 561             561.08          .08\r\n    20            29                 590             590.61          .61\r\n    21            30                 620             620.14          .14\r\n    22            29                 649             649.67          .67\r\n    23            30                 679             679.20          .20\r\n    24            29                 708             708.73          .73\r\n    25            30                 738             738.26          .26\r\n    26            29                 767             767.80          .80\r\n    27            30                 797             797.33          .33\r\n    28            29                 826             826.86          .86\r\n    29            30                 856             856.39          .39\r\n    30            29                 885             885.92          .92\r\n    31            30                 915             915.45          .45\r\n    32            29                 944             944.98          .98\r\n    33            30                 974             974.51          .51\r\n    34            29                1003            1004.04         1.04\r\n\r\nThis series of 135 lunar months, or 23 eclipse seasons, can be repeated\r\nalmost indefinitely, alternating 3986 and 3987 days to the series and\r\nstill keep the synodical month in accord with the eclipse season. But\r\nanother factor must also be considered. Months of 29 and 30 days cannot\r\nbe simply alternated and either conform with the true synodical month or\r\ncomplete the ecliptic series mentioned, for 3986 contains three more\r\ndays than sixty-eight 30-day months, and sixty-seven 29-day months.\r\nTherefore in the 3986 series three of the 29-day months must be changed\r\nto 30-day months, and in the 3987 series four must be changed. The\r\nposition of these changes is arbitrary. They can, for example, be the\r\n34th, 68th, and 102d months, and when necessary, the 134th.\r\n\r\nTABLE IX\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF SYNODIC MONTHS AND ECLIPSES\r\n\r\n  Eclipse season          Synodic month\r\n  Number    Days          Number   Days         Difference\r\n    1     173.310           6     177.184            3.874\r\n    2     346.620          12     354.367            7.747\r\n    3     519.930          18     531.551           11.621\r\n    4     693.240          23     679.204          -14.036\r\n    5     866.550          29     856.387          -10.163\r\n    6    1039.860          35    1033.571           -6.289\r\n    7    1213.170          41    1210.754           -2.416\r\n    8    1386.480          47    1387.938            1.458\r\n    9    1559.790          53    1565.121            5.331\r\n   10    1733.100          59    1742.305            9.205\r\n   11    1906.411          65    1919.489           13.078\r\n   12    2079.721          70    2067.141          -12.580\r\n   13    2253.031          76    2244.325           -8.706\r\n   14    2426.341          82    2421.508           -4.833\r\n   15    2599.651          88    2598.692            -.959\r\n   16    2772.961          94    2775.875            2.914\r\n   17    2946.271         100    2953.059            6.788\r\n   18    3119.581         106    3130.243           10.662\r\n   19    3292.891         112    3307.426           14.535\r\n   20    3466.201         117    3455.079          -11.122\r\n   21    3639.511         123    3632.263           -7.248\r\n   22    3812.821         129    3809.446           -3.375\r\n   23    3986.131         135    3986.630             .499\r\n\r\nTABLE X\r\n\r\n148-DAY GROUPS\r\n\r\n  Upper         Month\r\n  number       number            Interval        Groups\r\n    502           17\r\n                                    59 \\\r\n   2244           76                   |         94(47 + 47)\r\n                                    35 /\r\n   3278          111\r\n                                    41           41\r\n   4488          152\r\n                                    59 \\\r\n   6230          211                   |         94(47 + 47)\r\n                                    35 /\r\n   7264          246\r\n                                    41           41\r\n   8474          287\r\n                                    53 \\\r\n  10039          340                   |         94(47 + 47)\r\n                                    41 /\r\n  11250          381\r\n\r\nThe next logical step is a comparison between the theoretical calendars\r\njust described and the manuscript. A study of the manuscript reveals\r\nthat: (1) the series recorded represents 405 lunar months or three times\r\n135 months, and that the series naturally falls into three great\r\nsubdivisions of 3986 days each; (2) each third consists of 23 columns\r\nor unequal subdivisions; (3) the intervals between the 178-day groups\r\nare 47 and 88 months; (4) the 148-day groups fall approximately at 47\r\nand 41 month intervals (see Table X); (5) the first 178-day group in\r\neach third occurs between the 30th and 35th month inclusive, and the\r\nother 178-day group of the third comes 47 months later. Since the number\r\n178 is composed of four 30-and two 29-day months, an extra day must have\r\nbeen added, that is, a 30-day month was substituted for one of the\r\n29-day months, if the manuscript represents a regular alternating\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThe obvious conclusions to be drawn from these facts are: (1) that the\r\nseries was divided into three groups of 3986 days each in order to\r\nassociate the lunar calendar closely with the ecliptic cycle of the same\r\nlength; (2) that the 23 columns in each third may represent the\r\ntwenty-three eclipse seasons in each eclipse period of 3986 days; (3)\r\nthat groups of 47 and 41 months were used in some way in the series, for\r\nthe 178-day groups are separated by 47 and 88 months and 88 is composed\r\nof 47 and 41, the two periods so closely associated with the recurrence\r\nof eclipses; (4) that the six months period was changed to one of five\r\nmonths of 148 days approximately every 47 and 41 months, which is the\r\nmethod already advanced in the theoretical ecliptic lunar series for\r\nkeeping the synodical months and ecliptic seasons together; (5) that one\r\nextra day was added to the alternating 29-and 30-day months, between the\r\n30th and 35th month inclusive of each third, in accordance with the\r\ntheoretical necessity for so doing already brought out, and that another\r\nof the three extra days was added 47 months later.\r\n\r\nWhen the difference groups[25] are divided into months it is found that\r\nit is an easy matter to arrange the months in an alternating series. The\r\ngroup of 177 days is composed of three 30-and three 29-day months,\r\neither of which when alternated can begin the group, which then ends\r\nwith the other, i.e., 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, or 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29.\r\nThe group of 148 days consists of three 30-and two 29-day months,\r\nnecessitating that it begin and end with a 30-day month when alternated,\r\nthus, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30. In the 178-day group one of the 29-day months\r\nis replaced by a 30-day month, otherwise the group is exactly like that\r\nof 177 days, which it exceeds by one day. It is evident that there will\r\nalways be three 30-day months in succession in the 178-day group, and\r\nthat care must be taken in choosing the right sequence of the 177-day\r\ngroups which fall near those of 148 days in order to avoid having two\r\n30-day months in succession.\r\n\r\n  [25] That is, the 177-day, 148-day and 178-day groups.\r\n\r\nThere remains simply the substitution of the six or five months, as the\r\ncase may be, in place of the difference groups in the manuscript.\r\nHowever, if the Mayas considered each third of the table as a unit, it\r\nis reasonable to assume that the sequence of the months in each third is\r\nidentical. Therefore it is necessary to arrange a sequence for only\r\none-third, that is, 135 months, and then, if the assumption is correct,\r\nthis sequence will fit the other two-thirds of the series.\r\n\r\nEach third of the table consists of 135 months covering three more days\r\nthan would be covered by a simple alternation of 30-and 29-day months.\r\nThese three intercalary days were inserted at definite intervals. A clue\r\nto the position of two of them is given by the 178-day groups. One was\r\ninserted between the 30th and 35th months, another 47 months later,\r\nbetween the 77th and 82d months. Theoretically the extra day should be\r\ninserted in the 34th month after the beginning of a series of\r\nalternating 29-and 30-day months, for then the error between the\r\nsynodical revolution of the moon and the calendrical months becomes more\r\nthan one day. In the 29-day month preceding the 34th, namely the 32d\r\nmonth, the error at the end is also practically one day, i.e., .98 days.\r\nThe 29-day month most nearly the centre of the first 178-day group is\r\nthe 32d month of the series, the third in the group. The Mayas may have\r\nchosen this month because of its position in the 178-day group, making\r\nthe sequence of the months 29, 30, 30, 30, 29, 30, if the 30th month was\r\na 29-day month as it would be by simple alternation.\r\n\r\nThe second time this intercalary day occurs in each third is 47 months\r\nlater. Obviously, this may be the recurrence of this intercalation in a\r\nrepetition of a smaller group of months than the 135-month group. If 47\r\nmonths are subtracted from the 79th month which is the third in the\r\nsecond 178-day group the result is 32, which implies that the smaller\r\ndivision is 47 months. Two 47-month periods complete all but 41 of the\r\n135 months in each third. Then, of necessity, if each third of the\r\nmanuscript is a unit, a 41-month group follows two 47-month groups, an\r\narrangement which also agrees with the eclipse groups in Tables V.\r\n\r\nThe two 178-day groups account for only two of the three intercalated\r\ndays, and since no 178-day group occurs in the 41-month division, the\r\naddition of this day must have been accomplished in some more obscure\r\nmanner. Since both 47 and 41 are odd numbers, each group must contain at\r\nleast one more month of one kind than the other. Since two synodical\r\nrevolutions of the moon are slightly longer than two calendrical months\r\nit is wisest to start and end each group with a 30-day month. If this is\r\ndone, the 47-month group will contain twenty-five 30-day and twenty-two\r\n29-day months, and the 41-month group twenty-one 30-day and twenty\r\n29-day months, making for the composition of the 135 months, seventy-one\r\n30-day and sixty-four 29-day months, that is, seven more of the 30-day\r\nmonths than of those of 29 days, showing that actually three of the\r\nsixty-seven 29-day months expected in a normal repetition have become\r\n30-day months. This is caused by the occurrence of two 30-day months in\r\nsuccession at the end of one series and the beginning of the next. If\r\nthe 135 months in each third are numbered in succession it will be seen\r\nthat in the first 47-month group and in the 41-month group, the 30-day\r\nmonths are the odd numbers. In the second 47-month group they are the\r\neven numbers, of which there is one more in this division than odd\r\nnumbers, thus accounting for the additional one of the three days.\r\n\r\nIf the period of 3986 days were considered by itself, the arrangement\r\ngiven would be sufficient. As soon, however, as this period is repeated\r\na number of times an error develops, since 135 synodical revolutions of\r\nthe moon are completed in 3986.63 days. Twice this number gives 7973.26,\r\nor 1.26 days more than twice 3986. In order to keep the sequence of\r\nmonths in the arrangement given above in accordance with the moon, it\r\nbecomes necessary to intercalate one more day every two repetitions of\r\nthe 3986 period. This may be done by changing the last 29-day month in\r\nthe 41-month group to a 30-day month, making the last 177-day group in\r\nthe third one of 178 days. The Mayas certainly did this in the first\r\nthird of the series given and arranged for it in the last third in a\r\nmanner which will be demonstrated later.\r\n\r\nTabulating the solution here advanced will form Table XI (p. 25), in\r\nwhich the 30-and 29-day months in one-third of the manuscript have been\r\narranged in three columns, the first two of which represent the 47-month\r\ngroups and the last one the 41-month group. Before the first column of\r\nmonths are numbers to facilitate locating any given month in the group.\r\nThe two kinds of months occur in direct alternation in each group, with\r\nthree exceptions. The 32d month in both of the 47-month groups is one of\r\n30 days instead of 29, because of the addition of the intercalary day.\r\nThe 40th month in the 41-month group is given as one of 29 days with a\r\n30 in parentheses before it, representing the fact that every other\r\nthird an extra intercalary day should be inserted in this month. To the\r\nright of the month columns are three columns giving the difference\r\ngroups as found in the manuscript (see Table II), each column giving\r\nthose numbers found in each third of the manuscript, the first third\r\nbeing the left one of the three. It should be noticed that the misplaced\r\n(?) 148-day group in the last third does not interfere with the sequence\r\nof the months.\r\n\r\nFinally it only remains to review the irregularities of the manuscript\r\nin the light of the solution just advanced. Those irregularities which\r\nare corrected immediately afterwards, or are at variance with the rest\r\nof the column in which they occur, are, in all probability, errors on\r\nthe part of the writer of the series, such as might have been caused by\r\ncareless transcription from another copy of the table, and correction in\r\nthe following column to avoid the task of erasure. Eliminating these\r\nirregularities, there remain three to be investigated, namely, (1) the\r\nabsence of the 178 numbers in the lower number series, with one\r\nconspicuous exception; (2) the occurrence of 178 in column 7 instead of\r\n6, and of 148 in column 58 instead of 59; and (3) the discrepancies in\r\nthe totals of the series.\r\n\r\nTABLE XI.—THE ARRANGEMENT OF LUNAR MONTHS IN THE DRESDEN TABLE\r\n\r\n   No.   Days                  Days                    Days\r\n   of     in   Dresden groups   in    Dresden groups    in   Dresden groups\r\n  month  month    1    2    3  month    1   2    3   month    1    2    3\r\n\r\n    1     30 \\                  30 \\                   30 \\\r\n    2     29 |                  29 |                   29 |\r\n    3     30 |                  30 |                   30 |\r\n    4     29 |  177  177  177   29 |   177  177  177   29 |  177  177  177\r\n    5     30 |                  30 |                   30 |\r\n    6     29 /                  29 /                   29 /\r\n    7     30 \\                  30 \\                   30 \\\r\n    8     29 |                  29 |                   29 |\r\n    9     30 |                  30 |                   30 |\r\n   10     29 |  177  177  177   29 |   177  177  177   29 |  177  177  177\r\n   11     30 |                  30 |                   30 |\r\n   12     29 /                  29 /                   29 /\r\n   13     30 \\                  30 \\                   30 \\\r\n   14     29 |                  29 |                   29 |\r\n   15     30 |  148  148  148   30 |                   30 |  148  148  148\r\n   16     29 |                  29 |   177  177  177   29 |\r\n   17     30 /                  30 |                   30 /\r\n   18     29 \\                  29 /                   29 \\\r\n   19     30 |                  30 \\ \\                 30 |\r\n   20     29 |                  29 | |           148   29 |\r\n   21     30 |  177  177  177   30 | | 177  177        30 |  177  177  177\r\n   22     29 |                  29 | |                 29 |\r\n   23     30 /                  30 | /                 30 /\r\n   24     29 \\                  29 / \\                 29 \\\r\n   25     30 |                  30 \\ |                 30 |\r\n   26     29 |                  29 | |           177   29 |\r\n   27     30 |  177  177  177   30 | | 148  148        30 |  177  177  177\r\n   28     29 |                  29 | |                 29 |\r\n   29     30 /                  30 / /                 30 |\r\n   30     29 \\                  29 \\                   29 /\r\n   31     30 |                  30 |                   30 \\\r\n  *32     30 |                  30 |                   29 |\r\n   33     30 |  178  178  178   30 |   178  178  178   30 |  177  177  177\r\n   34     29 |                  29 |                   29 |\r\n   35     30 /                  30 /                   30 /\r\n   36     29 \\                  29 \\                   29 \\\r\n   37     30 |                  30 |                   30 |\r\n   38     29 |  177  177  177   29 |   177  177  177   29 |  178  177  177\r\n   39     30 |                  30 |                   30 |           (178)\r\n   40     29 |                  29 |               (30)29 |\r\n   41     30 /                  30 /                  -30 /\r\n   42     29 \\                  29 \\\r\n   43     30 |                  30 |\r\n   44     29 |                  29 |\r\n   45     30 |  177  177  177   30 |   177  177  177\r\n   46     29 |                  29 |\r\n   47     30 /                  30 /\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the difference groups as expressed by the lower number\r\nseries are 177, the only departure from these being the designation of\r\nthe 148-day groups and the extra 178-day group at the end of the first\r\nthird. The complete disregard of all of the six normal 178-day groups by\r\nthe lower numbers seems to imply that no attempt was made to have the\r\nlatter agree with the actual differences in the upper numbers, a\r\nconclusion which is strengthened by the fact that none of the lower\r\nnumbers shows evidence of the clerical errors in the differences of the\r\nupper numbers. It seems most probable that the lower number series was\r\nintended merely as a guide to indicate the position of the five month\r\nperiods and to place emphasis on the extra intercalary day added in the\r\n23d column, without attempting to have this series accurate.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the 178-day group in column 7 instead of 6 has been\r\ndiscussed at some length under the description of the errors. The\r\nscribe, realizing that in neglecting to put in this 178-day group, the\r\nfirst one of the series, a serious error had been committed, may have\r\nattempted to erase the incorrect record in column 6; then, realizing\r\nthat four numbers and three glyphs would have to be altered, decided to\r\ncorrect this mistake—although it was of more importance than the other\r\ntwo errors—as he had the former ones, i.e., by making the correction in\r\nthe next column.\r\n\r\nThe very similar irregularity in the last third of the manuscript, the\r\nplacing of the 148-day group one column ahead of its expected position,\r\ncannot be explained in the same manner. It is very evident that this\r\ncolumn has been deliberately placed where it is. That it does not have\r\nto do with the month sequence is evident, since it does not affect it.\r\nIt must then affect the ecliptic part of the series, for it causes a\r\nshort season to occur six months earlier than expected. Upon comparison\r\nof Tables VI and X, it will be seen that all of the dates of the 148-day\r\ngroup occur during one of the eclipse groups given in Schram’s table.\r\nHowever, had the 148-day group under discussion been placed in the 59th\r\ncolumn, as uniformity demands, this number, 10,216, would not have\r\nfallen in one of the eclipse groups given in Table VI. This tends to\r\nshow that there was some reason other than regulating the difference\r\ngroups to agree with the eclipse seasons, for the position of the\r\n148-day groups. This reason, as yet undetermined, is possibly associated\r\nwith the pictures, which immediately follow the 148-day groups.\r\n\r\nFinally there remain only the totals of the series to be considered. The\r\ntotal of the upper number series records 11,958 days. Sixty-nine eclipse\r\nseasons complete 11,958.39 days, less than half a day more than the\r\nrecorded number. This close agreement and the failure to add the extra\r\nintercalary day to the upper number series at the end of the first\r\nthird, give rise to the belief that the upper number series is a\r\ncalendar in itself, and records a means by which dates of probable\r\neclipses may be reckoned. The units of the count were eclipse seasons\r\nexpressed as lunar months, 69 of which are represented in the calendar\r\nrecorded on these pages.\r\n\r\nThe Mayas undoubtedly knew the relation of the eclipses to the moon, at\r\nleast in a vague way, and felt that it was necessary to associate this\r\neclipse calendar in some way with the lunar calendar, composed of 29-and\r\n30-day months. Therefore the day series is found immediately below the\r\nupper number series. This series of days constitutes a lunar calendar\r\nwhich coincides as closely as possible with the eclipse calendar. It may\r\nbe the formal lunar calendar of the Mayas, but it may also be an\r\nadaptation of the formal calendar to the eclipse periods. The day series\r\nvaries from the eclipse series in two places only. At the end of the\r\nfirst third of the series, it was necessary to add one day to the lunar\r\ncalendar, an addition strongly pointed out in the record, but not to the\r\neclipse calendar, because of the increasing error between the\r\nrevolutions of the moon and the calendrical lunar months. Therefore,\r\nthroughout the remaining two-thirds of the series, the lunar calendar\r\nwas one day in advance of the eclipse calendar. At the end of the\r\nseries, since 405 of the moon’s revolutions complete 11,959.89 days, and\r\nthe day series only 11,959, one more day should be added, in order to\r\nkeep the error as small as possible. This was accomplished by changing\r\nfrom the middle to the lower line of days.\r\n\r\nOn page 52a, immediately preceding the calendar, are four day signs with\r\nnumbers. One of these, 12 Lamat, is the zero day of the day series, but\r\nis associated with the middle line of day glyphs and not the upper line,\r\nas might be expected. The series of days which come, calendrically\r\nspeaking, just before and after the actual series, may have been placed\r\nin the record to show that slight variations from the average were to be\r\nexpected. The entire record is based on the middle line of days until\r\nthe end of the series. Here the day just below the last day of the\r\nmiddle line is 12 Lamat, the end of 46 _tonalamatls_ (260-day cycle),\r\nand the zero day of the recorded series. The _tonalamatl_ was probably\r\nas easily used by the Mayas as “60 days” and “90 days” are used now. The\r\nentire calendrical system of the Mayas is based on the cycle principle.\r\nThe series recorded in these pages was probably also a cycle, and in\r\norder to repeat it, 12 Lamat must again be used as the zero date. If to\r\nthese arguments is added the fact that an additional day is necessary to\r\nkeep the calendar in accord with the synodic revolution of the moon,\r\nthere remains little doubt but that the users of this calendar added the\r\nextra day by going from the middle to the lower line of day glyphs,\r\nthereby keeping the error between the moon and the calendar as low as\r\npossible, completing the 46th _tonalamatl_, and at the same time making\r\nit possible to repeat the recorded series as a cycle. If the series is\r\nrepeated once, at the end of 810 months, or about 66-1/2 years, the\r\neclipse calendar will be behind the average eclipse season .78 days, and\r\nthe lunar calendar will be in advance of the synodical revolutions of\r\nthe moon only .22 days.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, the irregularities in the calendar recorded on these\r\npages fall into two groups, those which are clerical errors of the\r\nscribe and do not therefore affect the solution advanced, and those\r\nwhich do not appear to be of the clerical type. In the light of the\r\nsolution advanced, it has been shown that there are perfectly logical\r\nreasons for the latter group of apparent irregularities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOn pages 51 to 58 of the Dresden Codex occurs a series of numbers,\r\nrunning continuously through all the pages except the upper halves of\r\nthe first two. This series records a period of 11,960 days, divided by\r\nmeans of columns into sixty-nine unequal subdivisions, of 177, 148, and\r\n178 days, of which the first is the most frequent.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct series. One series of numbers is in the upper\r\npart of the record, and consists of totals increased step by step until\r\nthe final total reached records 11,958 days. Just below this series are\r\nthree series of day signs and numbers, the middle one of which is the\r\nactual series. These dates are separated by the same number of days as\r\nthe upper number series, except in the 23d group, at which place one\r\nextra day is added to the day series and not to the upper number series,\r\ncausing the former to be in advance of the latter one day throughout the\r\nremainder of the record. At the end of the day series another extra day\r\nis added by counting in the last day in the lower row of days, thus\r\ncompleting the 11,960-day period.\r\n\r\nBelow this day series is another number series no term of which exceeds\r\n178. In a general way it records the differences between the dates\r\nappearing above each of its numbers. The agreement is however so\r\ninaccurate that this lower number series could, at best, have been used\r\nonly as a general guide to the user of the manuscript, in that it calls\r\nattention to the intervals of unusual length.\r\n\r\nThe series recorded is composed of three equal parts, each composed of\r\n23 subdivisions and covering 3986 days.\r\n\r\nThe number series on these pages record an eclipse calendar, that is, a\r\nseries of dates by means of which the occurrence of eclipses was\r\nforetold. This calendar is composed of three identical parts, with the\r\nexception of one 148-day group which occurs six months earlier in the\r\nlast third than in the other two. Each third is composed of 23 unequal\r\nsubdivisions which represent the twenty-three eclipse seasons, expressed\r\nin lunar months, in 3986 days. The upper number series records this\r\ncalendar, and its total of 11,958 days is only .39 days less than 69\r\neclipse seasons.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it more intelligible this eclipse calendar is\r\naccompanied by a probably more generally known lunar calendar, which may\r\nhave been altered slightly to conform to the requirements of the eclipse\r\ncalendar it accompanies. This lunar calendar is contained in the day\r\nseries just below the eclipse calendar. It also is recorded in three\r\ndivisions agreeing closely with the eclipse calendar. One hundred and\r\nthirty-five lunar months of 30 and 29 days complete 3986 days, .63 days\r\nless than 135 synodical revolutions of the moon. This error which\r\namounts to more than one day when repeated once, necessitates the\r\naddition of an extra day in the lunar calendar every other third, which\r\nwas done in the manuscript in the first and last third, making the total\r\nrecorded by the lunar calendar 11,960, two days more than the eclipse\r\ncalendar, and .11 days more than 405 synodical revolutions of the moon.\r\nThis period of 11,960 days may have been used as a cycle, the zero day\r\nof which is 12 Lamat.\r\n\r\nEach third of the lunar calendar consists of 30-and 29-day months\r\narranged in alternating sequence, with intercalary days added by the\r\nsubstitution of a 30-day for a 29-day month when the error arising from\r\nthe nonconformity of the moon’s revolution reaches more than one day. In\r\norder that the lunar calendar might agree with the eclipse calendar more\r\nclosely, these months were recorded in groups of five and six.\r\n\r\nThe months in each third of the series were divided into three groups,\r\nwhich are the same in each third. The first two groups contained 47\r\nmonths each, and completed the first sixteen dates of the third. The\r\nlast group was one of 41 months, which was represented by the last seven\r\ndates of the third. An intercalary day was added in the 32d month of\r\neach of the 47-month groups to correct the accumulating error, thereby\r\ncausing the 6th and 14th subdivisions of the third to be of 178 days. In\r\nthe first and last third the 40th month of the 41-month group also\r\ncontained an intercalary day for the same reason, making the 23d\r\nsubdivision 178 days, but in the last column of the record this extra\r\nday is added by going from the middle to the lower line of day signs.\r\nEach of the 47-and 41-month divisions began and ended with a month of\r\nthirty days.\r\n\r\nThe numerical series of these pages of the Dresden record, then, an\r\neclipse calendar which is referred to a lunar calendar. This solution\r\nexplains all the irregularities of the series except those which seem\r\nclearly to be clerical errors of the scribe.\r\n\r\nOnly the numerical and calendrical series on these pages have been\r\nconsidered. No attempt has been made to explain the hieroglyphs, the\r\npictures, or the first two pages, which, although showing a close\r\nassociation to the long series, are nevertheless a unit in themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  BOWDITCH, C.
