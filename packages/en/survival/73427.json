Into the causes of this I shall not here inquire. I may remark,\r\nhowever, that if Agriculture is ever to be brought to that comparative\r\nstate of perfection to which many other arts have already attained, it\r\nwill only be by availing itself, as they have done, of the many aids\r\nwhich Science offers to it; and that, if the practical man is ever to\r\nrealize upon his farm all the advantages which Science is capable of\r\nplacing within his reach, it will only be when he has become so far\r\nacquainted with the connection that exists between the art by which he\r\nlives and the sciences, especially of Chemistry and Geology, as to be\r\nprepared to listen with candour to the suggestions they are ready to\r\nmake to him, and to attach their proper value to the explanations of\r\nhis various processes which they are capable of affording.\r\n\r\nThe following little Treatise is intended to present a familiar outline\r\nof the subjects of _Agricultural Chemistry and Geology_, as treated of\r\nmore at large in my LECTURES, of which the first Part is now before the\r\npublic. What in this work has necessarily been taken for granted, or\r\nbriefly noticed, is in the LECTURES examined, discussed, or more fully\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\n_Durham, 8th April, 1842._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n    Distinction between Organic and Inorganic Substances\r\n        —The Ash of Plants—Constitution of the Organic\r\n        Parts of Plants—Preparation and Properties of\r\n        Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen—Meaning\r\n        of Chemical Combination.                                    13\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    Form in which these different Substances enter into\r\n        Plants—Properties of the Carbonic, Humic, and\r\n        Ulmic Acids; of Water, of Ammonia, and of Nitric\r\n        Acid—Constitution of the Atmosphere.                     25\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Structure of Plants—Mode in which their Nourishment\r\n        is obtained—Growth and Substance of Plants—\r\n        Production of their Substance from the Food they\r\n        imbibe—Mutual Transformations of Starch, Sugar,\r\n        and Woody Fibre.                                         38\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    Of the Inorganic Constituents of Plants—Their\r\n        immediate Source—Their Nature—Quantity of each\r\n        in certain common Crops.                                 49\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    Of Soils—Their Organic and Inorganic Portions—Saline\r\n        Matter in Soils—Examination and Classification of\r\n        Soils—Diversities of Soils and Subsoils.                 67\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    Direct Relations of Geology to Agriculture—Origin\r\n        of Soils—Causes of their Diversity—Relation to\r\n        the Rocks on which they rest—Constancy in the\r\n        Relative Position and Character of the Stratified\r\n        Rocks—Relation of this Fact to Practical\r\n        Agriculture—General Characters of the Soils upon\r\n        these Rocks.                                             78\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    Soils of the Granitic and Trap Rocks—Accumulations\r\n        of Transported Sands, Gravels, and Clays—Use\r\n        of Geological Maps in reference to\r\n        Agriculture—Physical Characters and Chemical\r\n        Constitution of Soils—Relation between the Nature\r\n        of the Soil and the Kind of Plants that naturally\r\n        grow upon it.                                           103\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    Of the Improvement of the Soil—Mechanical and Chemical\r\n        Methods—Draining—Subsoiling—Ploughing, and Mixing\r\n        of Soils—Use of Lime, Marl, and Shell-sand—\r\n        Manures—Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral Manures.         133\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    Animal Manures—Their Relative Value and Mode of\r\n        Action—Difference between Animal and Vegetable\r\n        Manures—Cause of this Difference—Mineral Manures—\r\n        Nitrates of Potash and Soda—Sulphate of Soda,\r\n        Gypsum, Chalk, and Quicklime—Chemical Action of\r\n        these Manures—Artificial Manures—Burning and\r\n        Irrigation of the Soil—Planting and Laying Down\r\n        to Grass.                                               165\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    The Products of Vegetation—Importance of _Chemical_\r\n        quality as well as quantity of Produce—Influence\r\n        of different Manures on the quantity and quality\r\n        of the Crop—Influence of the Time of Cutting—\r\n        Absolute quantity of Food yielded by different Crops\r\n        —Principles on which the Feeding of Animals depends\r\n        —Theoretical and Experimental Value of different kinds\r\n        of Food for Feeding Stock—Concluding Observations.      216\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ELEMENTS\r\n                                  OF\r\n                      AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Distinction between Organic and Inorganic\r\n        Substances.—The Ash of Plants.—Constitution\r\n        of the Organic Parts of Plants.—Preparation\r\n        and Properties of Carbon, Hydrogen, and\r\n        Nitrogen.—Meaning of Chemical Combination.\r\n\r\nThe object of the practical farmer is to raise from a given extent of\r\nland the largest quantity of the most valuable produce at the least\r\ncost, and with the least permanent injury to the soil. The sciences\r\neither of chemistry or geology throw light on every step he takes or\r\nought to take, in order to effect this main object.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF THE VEGETABLE AND EARTHY OR THE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC\r\nPARTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of his art, two distinct classes of substances\r\nengage his attention—the _living_ crops he raises, and the _dead_\r\nearth from which they are gathered. If he examine any fragment of\r\nan animal or vegetable, either living or dead, he will observe that\r\nit exhibits pores of various kinds arranged in a certain order—that\r\nit has a species of internal structure—that it has various parts or\r\n_organs_—in short, that it is what physiologists term _organized_. If\r\nhe examine, in like manner, a lump of earth or rock, he will perceive\r\nno such structure. To mark this distinction, the parts of animals and\r\nvegetables, either living or dead—whether entire or in a state of\r\ndecay, are called _organic_ bodies, while earthy and stony substances\r\nare called _inorganic_ bodies.\r\n\r\nOrganic substances are also more or less readily burned and dissipated\r\nby heat in the open air; inorganic substances are generally fixed and\r\npermanent in the fire.\r\n\r\nBut the crops which grow upon it, and the soil in which they are\r\nrooted, contain a portion of both of these classes of substances. In\r\nall fertile soils, there exists from 3 to 10 per cent. of vegetable\r\nor other matter of _organic_ origin; while, on the other hand, all\r\nvegetables, as they are collected for food, leave, when burned, from\r\none-half to twenty per cent. of _inorganic_ ash.\r\n\r\nIf we heat a portion of soil to redness in the open air, the organic\r\nmatter will burn away, and, in general, the soil, if previously\r\n_dry_, will not be materially diminished in bulk. But if a handful of\r\nwheat, or of wheat straw, or of hay, be burned in the same manner,\r\nthe proportion that disappears is so great, that in most cases a\r\ncomparatively minute quantity only remains behind. Every one is\r\nfamiliar with this fact who has seen the small bulk of ash that is left\r\nwhen weeds, or thorns, or trees, are burned in the field, or when a\r\nhay or corn-stack is accidentally consumed. Yet the ash thus left is a\r\nvery appreciable quantity, and the study of its true nature throws much\r\nlight, as we shall hereafter see, on the practical management of the\r\nland on which any given crop is to be made to grow.\r\n\r\nThus the quantity of ash left by a ton of wheat straw is sometimes as\r\nmuch as 360 lbs.; by a ton of oat straw as much as 200 lbs.; while a\r\nton of the grain of wheat leaves only about 40 lbs.; of the grain of\r\noats about 90 lbs.; and of oak wood only 4 or 5 lbs. The quantities of\r\n_inorganic_ matter, therefore, though comparatively small, yet, in some\r\ncases, amount to a considerable weight in an entire crop. The nature,\r\nsource and uses of this earthy matter will be explained in a subsequent\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC PART OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe organic part of plants, when in a perfectly dry state, constitutes\r\ntherefore from 85 to 99 per cent. of their whole weight. Of those parts\r\nof plants which are cultivated for food, it is only hay and straw, and\r\na very few others, that contain as much as 10 per cent. of inorganic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThis organic part consists of four substances, known to chemists by the\r\nnames of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The first of these,\r\ncarbon, is a solid substance, the other three are gases or peculiar\r\nkinds of air.\r\n\r\n1. CARBON. When wood is burned in a covered heap, as is done by the\r\ncharcoal burners, or is distilled in iron retorts, as in making\r\nwood-vinegar, it is charred and converted into common wood charcoal.\r\nThis charcoal is the most usual and best known variety of carbon. It\r\nis black, soils the fingers, and is more or less porous according\r\nto the kind of wood from which it has been formed. Coke obtained by\r\ncharring or distilling coal is another variety. It is generally denser\r\nor heavier than the former, though less pure. Black lead is a third\r\nvariety, still heavier and more impure. The diamond is the only form in\r\nwhich carbon occurs in nature in a state of perfect purity.\r\n\r\nThis latter fact, that the diamond is pure carbon—that it is\r\nessentially the same substance with the finest and purest lamp-black—is\r\nvery remarkable; but it is only one of many striking circumstances that\r\nevery now and then present themselves before the inquiring chemist.\r\n\r\nCharcoal, the diamond, lamp-black, and all the other forms of carbon,\r\nburn away more or less slowly when heated in the air, and are converted\r\ninto a kind of gas known by the name of _carbonic acid_. The impure\r\nvarieties leave behind them a greater or less proportion of ash.\r\n\r\n2. HYDROGEN.—If oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid) be mixed with twice\r\nits bulk of water, and then poured upon iron filings, the mixture will\r\nspeedily begin to boil up, and bubbles of gas will rise to the surface\r\nof the liquid in great abundance. These are bubbles of hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nIf the experiment be performed in a bottle, the hydrogen which is\r\nproduced will gradually drive out the atmospheric air it contained,\r\nand will itself take its place. If a bit of wax taper be tied to the\r\nend of a wire, and when lighted be introduced into the bottle, it will\r\nbe instantly extinguished; while the hydrogen will take fire, and burn\r\nat the mouth of the bottle with a pale yellow flame. If the taper be\r\ninserted before the common air is all expelled, the mixture of hydrogen\r\nand common air will burn with an explosion more or less violent,\r\nand may even shatter the bottle and produce serious accidents. This\r\nexperiment, therefore, ought to be made with care. It may be safely\r\nmade in an open tumbler, covered by a plate or a piece of paper, till a\r\nsufficient quantity of hydrogen is collected, when, on the introduction\r\nof the taper, the light will be extinguished, and the hydrogen will\r\nburn with a less violent explosion.\r\n\r\nThis gas is also an exceedingly light substance, rising through common\r\nair as wood does through water. Hence, when confined in a bag made\r\nof silk, or other light tissue, it is capable of sustaining heavy\r\nsubstances in the air, and even of transporting them to great heights.\r\nFor this reason it is employed for filling and elevating balloons.\r\n\r\nHydrogen gas is not known to occur anywhere in nature in any sensible\r\nquantity. It is very abundant, as we shall hereafter see, in what by\r\nchemists is called a _state of combination_.\r\n\r\n3. OXYGEN.—When strong oil of vitriol is poured upon black oxide of\r\nmanganese, and heated in a glass retort: or when red oxide of mercury,\r\nor chlorate of potash, is so heated alone; or when saltpetre, or the\r\nsame oxide of manganese, is heated alone in an iron bottle;—in all\r\nthese cases a kind of air is given off, which, when collected and\r\nexamined by plunging a taper into it, is found to be neither common\r\nair nor hydrogen gas. The taper, when introduced, burns with great\r\nrapidity, and with exceeding brilliancy, and continues to burn till\r\neither the whole of the gas disappears, or the taper is entirely\r\nconsumed. If a living animal is introduced, its circulation and its\r\nbreathing become quicker—it is speedily thrown into a fever—it lives as\r\nfast as the taper burned—and, after a few hours, dies from excitement\r\nand exhaustion. This gas is not light like hydrogen, but is about\r\none-ninth part heavier than common air.\r\n\r\nIn the atmosphere, oxygen exists in the state of gas. It forms about\r\none-fifth of the bulk of the air we breathe, and is the substance\r\nwhich, in the air, supports all animal life and the combustion of\r\nall burning bodies. Were it by any cause suddenly removed from the\r\natmosphere of our globe, every living thing would perish, and all\r\ncombustion would become impossible.\r\n\r\n4. NITROGEN.—If a saucer be half filled with milk of lime, formed by\r\nmixing slaked quicklime with water, a _very_ small tea-cup containing\r\na little burning sulphur then placed in the middle, and a common large\r\ntumbler inverted over the whole, the sulphur will burn for a while, and\r\nwill then gradually die out. On allowing the whole to remain for some\r\ntime, the fumes of the sulphur will be absorbed by the milk of lime,\r\nwhich will rise a certain way into the tumbler. When the absorption has\r\nceased, a quantity of air will remain in the upper part of the tumbler.\r\nThis air is nitrogen gas.\r\n\r\nIf the whole be now introduced into a large basin of water, the tumbler\r\nbeing held in the left hand, the cup and saucer may be removed from\r\nbeneath. The saucer may then be inverted and introduced with its under\r\nside into the mouth of the tumbler, which may thus be lifted out of\r\nthe water and restored to its upright position, the saucer serving the\r\npurpose of a cover. By carefully removing this cover with the one hand,\r\na lighted taper may be introduced by the other. It will then be seen\r\nthat the taper is extinguished by this air, and that no other effect\r\nfollows. Or if a living animal be introduced into it, breathing will\r\ninstantly cease, and it will drop without signs of life.\r\n\r\nThis gas possesses no other remarkable property. It is a very little\r\nlighter than common air, and is known to exist in large quantity in the\r\natmosphere only. Of the air we breathe it forms nearly four-fifths of\r\nthe entire bulk.\r\n\r\nThese three gases are incapable of being distinguished from common\r\nair, or from each other, by the ordinary senses; but by the aid of the\r\ntaper they are readily recognised. Hydrogen extinguishes the taper, but\r\nitself takes fire; nitrogen simply extinguishes it; while in oxygen the\r\ntaper burns with extraordinary brilliancy and rapidity.\r\n\r\nOf this one solid substance, carbon, and these three gases, hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and nitrogen, all the organic part of vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances is made up.\r\n\r\nInto these substances, however, they enter in very different\r\nproportions. Nearly one-half the weight of all vegetable productions\r\nwhich are gathered as food for man or beast—in their dry state—consists\r\nof carbon; the oxygen amounts to rather more than one-third, the\r\nhydrogen to little more than five per cent., while the nitrogen rarely\r\nexceeds two and a half or three per cent. of their weight.\r\n\r\nThis will appear from the following table, which exhibits the actual\r\nconstitution by analysis of some varieties of the more common crops\r\nwhen perfectly dry.\r\n\r\n                  Carbon.  Hydrogen.  Oxygen.  Nitrogen.  Ash.\r\n    Hay,            458       50       387       15        90\r\n    Potatoes,       441       58       439       12        50\r\n    Wheat Straw,    485       52       389½       3½       70\r\n    Oats,           507       64       367       22        40\r\n\r\nThese numbers represent the weights of each element in pounds,\r\ncontained in 1000 lbs. of the dry hay, potatoes, &c.; but in drying by\r\na gentle heat, 1000 lbs. of hay from the stack, lost 158 lbs. of water,\r\nof potatoes wiped dry externally 722 lbs.,[1] wheat straw 260 lbs., and\r\noats 151 lbs.\r\n\r\n[1] Both potatoes and turnips contain about four-fifths of their weight\r\nof water, or five tons of either of these roots contain nearly four\r\ntons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE MEANING OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION.\r\n\r\nIf the three kinds of air above spoken of be mixed together in a\r\nbottle, no change will take place, and if charcoal in fine powder be\r\nadded to them, still no new substance will be produced. If we take the\r\nash left by a known weight of hay or wheat straw, and mix it with the\r\nproper quantities of the four elementary substances, carbon, hydrogen,\r\n&c., as shewn in the above table, we shall be unable by this means\r\nto form either hay or wheat straw. The elements of which vegetable\r\nsubstances consist, therefore, are not merely _mixed_ together—they are\r\nunited in some closer and more intimate manner. To this more intimate\r\nstate of union, the term _chemical combination_ is applied—the elements\r\nare said to be _chemically combined_.\r\n\r\nThus, when charcoal is burned in the air, it slowly disappears, and\r\nforms, as already stated, a kind of air known by the name of carbonic\r\nacid gas, which rises into the atmosphere and disappears. Now, this\r\ncarbonic acid is formed by the _union_ of the carbon (charcoal), while\r\nburning, with the oxygen of the atmosphere, and in this new air the two\r\nelements, carbon and oxygen, are _chemically combined_.\r\n\r\nAgain, if a piece of wood or a bit of straw, in which the elements are\r\nalready chemically combined, be burned in the air, these elements are\r\nseparated and made to assume new states of combination, in which new\r\nstates they escape into the air and become invisible. When a substance\r\nis thus changed by the action of heat, it is said to be _decomposed_,\r\nor if it gradually decay and perish by exposure to the air and\r\nmoisture, it undergoes slow _decomposition_.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, two or more substances unite together, so as to\r\nform a third possessing properties different from both, they enter\r\ninto chemical union—they form a _chemical combination_ or chemical\r\n_compound_. When, on the other hand, one compound body is so changed\r\nas to be converted into two or more substances different from itself,\r\nit is _decomposed_. Carbon, hydrogen, &c., are chemically combined in\r\nthe interior of the plant during the formation of wood: wood, again,\r\nis decomposed when by the vinegar-maker it is converted among other\r\nsubstances into charcoal and wood-vinegar, and the flour of grain when\r\nthe brewer or distiller converts it into ardent spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Form in which these different substances enter into\r\n        Plants. Properties of the Carbonic, Humic, and\r\n        Ulmic Acids—of Water, of Ammonia, and of Nitric\r\n        Acid. Constitution of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—FORM IN WHICH THE CARBON, ETC. ENTER INTO PLANTS.\r\n\r\nIt is from their food that plants derive the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nand nitrogen, of which their organic part consists. This food enters\r\npartly by the minute pores of their roots, and partly by those which\r\nexist in the green part of the leaf and of the young twig. The roots\r\nbring up food from the soil, the leaves take it in directly from the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nNow, as the pores in the roots and leaves are very minute, carbon\r\n(charcoal) cannot enter into either in a _solid_ state; and as it does\r\nnot dissolve in water, it cannot, in the state of simple carbon, be any\r\npart of the food of plants. Again, hydrogen gas neither exists in the\r\nair nor usually in the soil—so that, although hydrogen is always found\r\nin the substance of plants, it does not enter them in the state of the\r\ngas above described. Oxygen exists in the air, and is directly absorbed\r\nboth by the leaves and by the roots of plants; while nitrogen, though\r\nit forms a large part of the atmosphere, is not supposed to enter\r\n_directly_ into plants in any considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the carbon and hydrogen, and the greater part of the\r\noxygen and nitrogen also, enter into plants in a state of _chemical\r\ncombination_ with other substances; the carbon chiefly in the state of\r\n_carbonic acid_, and of certain other soluble compounds which exist\r\nin the soil; the hydrogen and oxygen in the form of water: and the\r\nnitrogen in those of ammonia or nitric acid. It will be necessary\r\ntherefore briefly to describe these several compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE CARBONIC, HUMIC, AND ULMIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\n1. CARBONIC ACID.—If a few pieces of chalk or limestone be put into\r\nthe bottom of a tumbler, and a little spirit of salt (muriatic acid)\r\nbe poured upon them, a boiling up or _effervescence_ will take place,\r\nand a gas will be given off, which will gradually collect and fill the\r\ntumbler; and when produced very rapidly, may even be seen to run over\r\nits edges. This gas is carbonic acid. It cannot be distinguished from\r\ncommon air by the eye; but if a taper be plunged into it, the flame\r\nwill immediately be extinguished, while the gas remains unchanged.\r\nThis kind of air is so heavy, that it may be poured from one vessel\r\ninto another, and its presence recognised by the taper. It has also a\r\npeculiar odour, and is exceedingly suffocating, so that if a living\r\nanimal be introduced into it, life immediately ceases. It is absorbed\r\nby water, a pint of water absorbing or dissolving a pint of the gas.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid exists in the atmosphere; it is given off from the lungs\r\nof all living animals while they breathe; it is also produced largely\r\nduring the burning of wood, coal, and all other combustible bodies, so\r\nthat an unceasing supply of this gas is poured into the air. Decaying\r\nanimal and vegetable substances also give off this gas, and hence it is\r\nalways present in greater or less abundance in the soil, and especially\r\nin such soils as are rich in vegetable matter. During the fermentation\r\nof malt liquors, or of the expressed juices of different fruits,—the\r\napple, the pear, the grape, the gooseberry—it is produced, and the\r\nbriskness of such fermented liquors is due to the escape of this gas.\r\nFrom the dung and compost heap it is also given off; and when put into\r\nthe ground in a fermenting state, farm-yard manure affords a rich\r\nsupply of carbonic acid to the young plant.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid consists of carbon and oxygen only, combined together in\r\nthe proportion of 28 of the former to 72 of the latter, or 100 lbs. of\r\ncarbonic acid contain 28 lbs. of carbon and 72 lbs. of oxygen.\r\n\r\n2. HUMIC AND ULMIC ACIDS.—The soil always contains a portion of\r\nvegetable matter (called _humus_ by some writers), and such matter is\r\nalways added to it when it is manured from the farm-yard or the compost\r\nheap. During the decay of this vegetable matter, carbonic acid, as\r\nabove stated, is given off in large quantity, but other substances\r\nare also formed at the same time. Among these are the two to which\r\nthe names of humic and ulmic acids are respectively given. They both\r\ncontain much carbon, are both capable of entering the roots of plants,\r\nand both, no doubt, in favourable circumstances, help to feed the plant.\r\n\r\nIf the common soda of the shops be dissolved in water, and a portion\r\nof a rich vegetable soil, or a bit of peat, be put into this solution,\r\nand the whole boiled, a brown liquid is obtained. If to this brown\r\nliquid, spirit of salt (muriatic acid) be added till it is sour to the\r\ntaste, a brown flocky powder falls to the bottom. This brown substance\r\nis _humic_ acid. But if in this process we use spirit of hartshorn\r\n(liquid ammonia), instead of the soda, _ulmic_ acid is obtained.\r\n\r\nThese acids exist along with other substances in the rich brown liquor\r\nof the farm-yard, which is so often allowed to run to waste; they are\r\nalso produced in greater or less quantity during the decay of the\r\nmanure after it is mixed with the soil, and no doubt yield to the plant\r\na portion of that supply of food which it must necessarily receive from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF WATER, AMMONIA, AND NITRIC ACID.\r\n\r\n1. WATER.—If hydrogen be prepared in a bottle, in the way already\r\ndescribed, and a gas-burner be fixed into its mouth, the hydrogen may\r\nbe lighted, and will burn as it escapes into the air. Held over this\r\nflame a cold tumbler will become covered with dew, or with little drops\r\nof water. This water is _produced_ during the burning of the hydrogen;\r\nand as it takes place in pure oxygen gas as well as in the open air,\r\nthis water must contain the hydrogen and oxygen which disappear, or\r\n_must consist of hydrogen and oxygen only_.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting fact; and were it not that chemists are now\r\nfamiliar with many such, it could not fail to appear truly wonderful\r\nthat the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, by their union, should form so\r\nvery different a substance as water is from either. It consists of 1\r\nof hydrogen to 8 of oxygen, or every 9 lbs. of water contain 8 lbs. of\r\noxygen and 1 lb. of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nWater is so familiar a substance, that it is unnecessary to dwell upon\r\nits properties. When pure, it has neither colour, taste, nor smell. At\r\n32° of Fahrenheit’s[2] scale (the freezing point), it solidifies into\r\nice, and at 212° it boils, and is converted into steam. There are two\r\nothers of its properties which are especially interesting in connection\r\nwith the growth of plants.\r\n\r\n[2] This is the scale of the common thermometer used in this country.\r\n\r\n_1st_, If sugar or salt be put into water, they disappear or are\r\n_dissolved_. Water has the power of thus dissolving numerous other\r\nsubstances in greater or less quantity. Hence, when the rain falls\r\nand sinks into the soil, it dissolves some of the soluble substances\r\nit meets in its way, and rarely reaches the roots of plants in a pure\r\nstate. So waters that rise up in springs are rarely pure. They always\r\ncontain earthy and saline substances in solution, and these they carry\r\nwith them, when they are sucked in by the roots of plants.\r\n\r\nIt has been above stated, that water absorbs (dissolves) its own bulk\r\nof carbonic acid; it dissolves also smaller quantities of the oxygen\r\nand nitrogen of the atmosphere; and hence, when it meets any of these\r\ngases in the soil, it becomes impregnated with them, and conveys them\r\ninto the plant, there to serve as a portion of its food.\r\n\r\n_2d_, Water is composed of oxygen and hydrogen; by certain chemical\r\nprocesses it can readily be resolved or decomposed _artificially_ into\r\nthese two gases. The same thing takes place _naturally_ in the interior\r\nof the living plant. The roots absorb the water, but if in any part\r\nof the plant hydrogen be required, to make up the substance which it\r\nis the function of that part to produce, a portion of the water is\r\ndecomposed and worked up, while the oxygen is set free, or converted to\r\nsome other use. So, also, in any case where oxygen is required water is\r\ndecomposed, the oxygen made use of, and the hydrogen liberated. Water,\r\ntherefore, which abounds in the vessels of all growing plants, if not\r\ndirectly converted into the substance of the plant, is yet a ready and\r\nample source from which a supply of either of the elements of which it\r\nconsists may at any time be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful adaptation of the properties of this all-pervading\r\ncompound (water), that its elements should be so fixedly bound together\r\nas rarely to separate in external nature, and yet to be at the command\r\nand easy disposal of the vital powers of the humblest order of living\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n2. AMMONIA.—If the sal ammoniac of the shops be mixed with quicklime,\r\na powerful odour is immediately perceived, and an invisible gas is\r\ngiven off which strongly affects the eyes. This gas is ammonia. Water\r\ndissolves or absorbs it in very large quantity, and this solution forms\r\nthe common hartshorn of the shops. The white solid smelling-salts of\r\nthe shops are a compound of ammonia with carbonic acid,—a solid formed\r\nby the union of two gases.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous ammonia consists of nitrogen and hydrogen only, in the\r\nproportion of 14 of the former to 3 of the latter, or 17 lbs. of\r\nammonia contain 3 lbs. of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe chief natural source of this compound is, in the decay of animal\r\nsubstances. During the putrefaction of dead animal bodies ammonia is\r\ninvariably given off. From the animal substances of the farm-yard it is\r\nevolved, and from all solid and liquid manures of animal origin. It is\r\nalso formed in lesser quantity during the decay of vegetable substances\r\nin the soil; and in volcanic countries, it escapes from many of the hot\r\nlavas, and from the crevices in the heated rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is produced artificially by the distillation of animal substances\r\n(hoofs, horns, &c.), or of coal. Thousands of tons of the ammonia\r\npresent in the ammoniacal liquors of the gas-works, which might be\r\nbeneficially applied as a manure, are annually carried down by the\r\nrivers, and lost in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia which is given off during the putrefaction of animal\r\nsubstances rises partially into the air, and floats in the atmosphere,\r\ntill it is either decomposed by natural causes, or is washed down by\r\nthe rains. In our climate, cultivated plants derive a considerable\r\nportion of their nitrogen from ammonia. It is supposed to be one of the\r\nmost valuable fertilizing substances contained in farm-yard manure; and\r\nas it is present in greater proportion by far in the liquid than in the\r\nsolid contents of the farm-yard, there can be no doubt that much real\r\nwealth is lost, and the means of raising increased crops thrown away in\r\nthe quantities of liquid manure which are almost everywhere permitted\r\nto run to waste.\r\n\r\n3. NITRIC ACID—is a powerfully corrosive liquid known in the shops by\r\nthe familiar name of _aquafortis_. It is prepared by pouring oil of\r\nvitriol (sulphuric acid) upon saltpetre, and distilling the mixture.\r\nThe aquafortis of the shops is a mixture of the pure acid with water.\r\n\r\nPure nitric acid consists of nitrogen and oxygen only; the union of\r\nthese two gases, so harmless in the air, producing the burning and\r\ncorrosive compound which this is known to be.\r\n\r\nIt never reaches the roots of plants in this free and corrosive state.\r\nIt exists in many soils, and is naturally formed in compost heaps,\r\nand in most situations where vegetable matter is undergoing decay\r\nin contact with the air; but it is always in a state of chemical\r\ncombination in these cases. With potash, it forms _nitrate of potash_\r\n(saltpetre); with soda, _nitrate of soda_; and with lime, _nitrate\r\nof lime_; and it is generally in one or other of these states of\r\ncombination that it reaches the roots of plants.\r\n\r\nNitric acid is also naturally formed, and in some countries probably in\r\nlarge quantities, by the passage of electricity through the atmosphere.\r\nThe air, as has been already stated, contains much oxygen and nitrogen\r\n_mixed_ together, but when an electric spark is passed through a\r\nquantity of air, a certain quantity of the two _unite_ together\r\nchemically, so that every spark that passes forms a small portion of\r\nnitric acid. A flash of lightning is only a large electric spark;\r\nand hence every flash that crosses the air produces along its path a\r\nquantity of this acid. Where thunder-storms are frequent, much nitric\r\nacid must be produced in this way in the air. It is washed down by the\r\nrains, in which it has frequently been detected, and thus reaches the\r\nsoil, where it produces one or other of the _nitrates_ above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt has been long observed that those parts of India are the most\r\nfertile in which saltpetre exists in the soil in the greatest\r\nabundance. Nitrate of soda, also, in this country, has been found\r\nwonderfully to promote vegetation in many localities; and it is a\r\nmatter of frequent remark, that vegetation seems to be refreshed and\r\ninvigorated by the fall of a thunder-shower. There is, therefore, no\r\nreason to doubt that nitric acid is really beneficial to the general\r\nvegetation of the globe. And since vegetation is most luxuriant\r\nin those parts of the globe where thunder _or_ lightning are most\r\nabundant, it would appear as if the natural production of this compound\r\nbody in the air, to be afterwards brought to the earth by the rains,\r\nwere a wise and beneficent contrivance by which the health and vigour\r\nof universal vegetation is intended to be promoted.\r\n\r\nIt is from this nitric acid, thus universally produced and existing,\r\nthat plants appear to derive a large—probably, taking vegetation in\r\ngeneral, the largest—portion of their nitrogen. In all climates they\r\nalso derive a portion of this element from ammonia; but less from this\r\nsource in tropical than in temperate climates.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] For fuller information on this point, see the Author’s “LECTURES\r\n_on Agricultural Chemistry and Geology_,” Part I.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nThe air we breathe, and from which plants also derive a portion of\r\ntheir nourishment, consists of a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases,\r\nwith a minute quantity of carbonic acid, and a variable proportion\r\nof watery vapour. Every hundred gallons of dry air contain about 21\r\ngallons of oxygen and 79 of nitrogen. The carbonic acid amounts only to\r\none gallon in 2500, while the watery vapour in the atmosphere varies\r\nfrom 1 to 2½ gallons (of steam) in 100 gallons of common air.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen in the air is necessary to the respiration of animals, and\r\nto the support of combustion (burning of bodies). The nitrogen serves\r\nprincipally to dilute the strength, so to speak, of the pure oxygen,\r\nin which gas, if unmixed, animals would live and combustibles burn\r\nwith too great rapidity. The small quantity of carbonic acid affords\r\nan important part of their food to plants, and the watery vapour in\r\nthe air aids in keeping the surfaces of animals and plants in a moist\r\nand pliant state; while, in due season, it descends also in refreshing\r\nshowers, or studs the evening leaf with sparkling dew.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful adjustment in the constitution of the atmosphere\r\nto the nature and necessities of living beings. The energy of the pure\r\noxygen is tempered, yet not too much weakened, by the admixture of\r\nnitrogen. The carbonic acid, which alone is noxious to life, is mixed\r\nin so minute a proportion as to be harmless to animals, while it is\r\nstill beneficial to plants; and when the air is overloaded with watery\r\nvapour, it is provided that it shall descend in rain. These rains at\r\nthe same time serve another purpose. From the surface of the earth\r\nthere are continually ascending vapours and exhalations of a more or\r\nless noxious kind; these the rains wash out from the air, and bring\r\nback to the soil, at once purifying the atmosphere through which they\r\ndescend, and refreshing and fertilizing the land on which they fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Structure of plants—Mode in which their nourishment\r\n        is obtained—Growth and substance of plants—\r\n        Production of their substance from the food\r\n        they imbibe—Mutual transformations of starch,\r\n        sugar, and woody fibre.\r\n\r\nFrom the compound substances, described in the preceding chapter,\r\nplants derive the greater portion of the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nand nitrogen, of which their organic part consists. The living\r\nplant possesses the power of absorbing these compound bodies, of\r\n_decomposing_ them in the interior of its several vessels, and of\r\n_recompounding_ their elements in a different way, so as to produce new\r\nsubstances,—the ordinary products of vegetable life. Let us briefly\r\nconsider the general structure of plants, and their mode of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF THE STRUCTURE OF PLANTS, AND THE MODE IN WHICH THEIR\r\nNOURISHMENT IS OBTAINED.\r\n\r\nA perfect plant consists of three several parts,—a root which throws\r\nout arms and fibres in every direction into the soil,—a trunk which\r\nbranches into the air on every side,—and leaves which, from the ends of\r\nthe branches and twigs, spread out a more or less extended surface into\r\nthe surrounding air. Each of these parts has a peculiar structure and a\r\nspecial function assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThe _stem_ of any of our common trees consists of three parts,—the\r\npith in the centre, the wood surrounding the pith, and the bark which\r\ncovers the whole. The pith consists of bundles of minute hollow tubes,\r\nlaid horizontally one over the other; the wood and inner bark, of long\r\ntubes bound together in a vertical position, so as to be capable of\r\ncarrying liquids up and down between the roots and the leaves. When a\r\npiece of wood is sawn across, the ends of these tubes may be distinctly\r\nseen. The branch is only a prolongation of the stem, and has a similar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe _root_, immediately on leaving the trunk or stem, has also a\r\nsimilar structure; but as the root tapers away, the pith gradually\r\ndisappears, the bark also thins out, the wood softens, till the white\r\ntendrils, of which its extremities are composed, consist only of a\r\ncolourless spongy mass, full of pores, but in which no distinction of\r\nparts can be perceived. In this spongy mass the vessels or tubes which\r\ndescend through the stem and root lose themselves, and by them these\r\nspongy extremities are connected with the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf_ is an expansion of the twig. The fibres which are seen\r\nto branch out from the base over the inner surface of the leaf are\r\nprolongations of the vessels of the wood. The green exterior portion\r\nof the leaf is, in like manner, a continuation of the bark in a very\r\nthin and porous form. The green of the leaf, though full of pores,\r\nespecially on the under part, yet also consists of, or contains, a\r\ncollection of tubes or vessels, which stretch along its surface, and\r\ncommunicate with those of the bark.\r\n\r\nMost of these vessels in the living plant are full of sap, and this sap\r\nis in almost continual motion. In spring and autumn the motion is more\r\nrapid, and in winter it is sometimes scarcely perceptible; yet the sap\r\nis supposed to be rarely quite stationary in every part of the tree.\r\n\r\nFrom the spongy part of the root the sap ascends through the vessels\r\nof the _wood_, till it is diffused over the inner surface of the leaf\r\nby the fibres which the wood contains. Hence, by the vessels in the\r\ngreen of the leaf, it is returned to the bark, and through the vessels\r\nof the inner bark it descends to the root.\r\n\r\nEvery one understands why the roots send out fibres in every direction\r\nthrough the soil,—it is in search of water and of _liquid_ food, which\r\nthe spongy fibres suck in and send forward with the sap to the upper\r\nparts of the tree. It is to aid these roots in procuring food that, in\r\nthe art of culture, such substances are mixed with the soil where these\r\nroots are, as are supposed to be necessary, or at least favourable, to\r\nthe growth of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is not so obvious that the leaves spread out their broad surfaces\r\ninto the air for the same purpose precisely as that for which the roots\r\ndiffuse their fibres through the soil. The only difference is, that\r\nwhile the roots suck in chiefly _liquid_, the leaves inhale almost\r\nsolely _gaseous_ food. _In the sunshine, the leaves are continually\r\nabsorbing carbonic acid from the air and giving off oxygen gas._ That\r\nis to say, they are continually appropriating carbon from the air.[4]\r\n_When night comes, this process ceases, and they begin to absorb\r\noxygen and to give off carbonic acid._ But this latter process does\r\nnot go on so rapidly as the former, so that, on the whole, plants\r\nwhen growing gain a large portion of carbon from the air. The actual\r\nquantity, however, varies with the season, with the climate, and with\r\nthe kind of tree. The proportion of the whole carbon contained by a\r\nplant, which has been derived from the air, is greatly modified also\r\nby the quality of the soil in which it grows, and by the comparative\r\nabundance of liquid food which happens to be within reach of its roots.\r\nIt has been ascertained, however, that in our climate, on an average,\r\nnot less than from one-third to three-fourths of the entire quantity of\r\ncarbon contained in the crops we reap from land of average fertility,\r\nis really obtained from the air.\r\n\r\n[4] Since carbonic acid, as shewn in the previous chapter, consists\r\nonly of carbon and oxygen, they retain the carbon and reject the oxygen.\r\n\r\nWe see then why, in arctic climates, where the sun once risen never\r\nsets again during the entire summer, vegetation should almost rush up\r\nfrom the frozen soil—the green leaf is ever gaining from the air and\r\nnever losing, ever taking in and never giving off carbonic acid, since\r\nno darkness ever interrupts or suspends its labours.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful, too, does the contrivance of the expanded leaf appear!\r\nThe air contains only one gallon of carbonic acid in 2500, and this\r\nproportion has been adjusted to the health and comfort of animals to\r\nwhom this gas is hurtful. But to catch this minute quantity, the tree\r\nhangs out thousands of square feet of leaf in perpetual motion, through\r\nan ever-moving air; and thus, by the conjoined labours of millions of\r\npores, the substance of whole forests of solid wood is slowly extracted\r\nfrom the fleeting winds. The green stem of the young shoot, and the\r\ngreen stalks of the grasses, also absorb carbonic acid as the green of\r\nthe leaf does, and thus a larger supply is afforded when the growth is\r\nmost rapid, or when the short life of the annual plant demands much\r\nnourishment within a limited time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE GROWTH AND SUBSTANCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nIn this way the perfect plant derives its food from the soil and\r\nfrom the air; but perfect plants arise from seeds; and the study of\r\nthe entire life—the career, so to speak—of a plant, presents many\r\ninteresting and instructive subjects of consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen a portion of flour is made into dough, and this dough is kneaded\r\nwith the hand under a stream of water upon a fine sieve, as long as the\r\nwater passes through milky, there will remain on the sieve a glutinous\r\nsticky substance resembling birdlime, while the milky water will\r\ngradually deposit a pure white powder. This powder is _starch_, that\r\nwhich remains on the sieve is _gluten_. Both of these substances exist,\r\ntherefore, in the flour; they both also exist in the grain. The starch\r\nconsists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only; the gluten, in addition\r\nto these, contains also nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWhen ground into flour, these substances serve for food to man; in\r\nthe unbruised grain they are intended to feed the future plant in its\r\nearliest infancy.\r\n\r\nWhen a seed is committed to the earth, if the warmth and moisture are\r\nfavourable, it begins to sprout. It pushes a shoot upwards, it thrusts\r\na root downwards, but, until the leaf expand, and the root has fairly\r\nentered the soil, the young plant derives no nourishment other than\r\nwater, either from the earth or from the air. It lives on the starch\r\nand gluten contained in the seed. But these substances, though capable\r\nof being separated from each other by means of water, as above stated,\r\nyet are neither of them soluble in water. Hence, they cannot, without\r\nundergoing a previous change, be taken up by the sap, and conveyed\r\nalong the pores of the young shoot they are destined to feed. But it is\r\nso arranged that, when the seed first shoots, there is produced at the\r\nbase of the germ, from a portion of the gluten, a small quantity of a\r\nsubstance (diastase) which has so powerful an effect upon the starch\r\nas immediately to render it soluble in the sap, which is thus enabled\r\nto take it up and convey it by degrees, just as it is wanted, to the\r\nshoot or to the root.[5] As the sap ascends, it becomes sweet,—the\r\nstarch thus dissolved changes into sugar. When the shoot first becomes\r\ntipped with green, the sugar is again changed into the woody fibre, of\r\nwhich the stem of perfect plants chiefly consists. By the time that the\r\nfood contained in the seed is exhausted,—often, as in the potato, long\r\nbefore,—the plant is able to live by its own exertions, at the expense\r\nof the air and the soil.\r\n\r\n[5] In malting barley, it is made to sprout a certain length, and the\r\ngrowth is then arrested by heating and drying it. Mashed barley, before\r\nsprouting, will not dissolve in water, but when sprouted, the whole of\r\nthe starch (the flour) it contains dissolves readily by a gentle heat.\r\nThe _diastase_ formed during the germination effects this. By further\r\nheating in the brewer’s wort, this starch is converted into sugar as it\r\nis in the growing plant.\r\n\r\nThis change of the sugar of the sap into woody fibre is observable\r\nmore or less in all plants. When they are shooting fastest the sugar\r\nis most abundant; not, however, in those parts which are growing, but\r\nin those which convey the sap to the growing parts. Thus the sugar of\r\nthe ascending sap of the maple and the alder disappears in the leaf\r\nand in the extremities of the twig; thus the sugar-cane _sweetens_\r\nonly a certain distance above the ground, up to where the new growth\r\nis proceeding; and thus also the young beet and turnip abound most in\r\nsugar, while in all these plants the sweet principle diminishes as the\r\nyear’s growth draws nearer to a close.\r\n\r\nIn the ripening of the ear also, the sweet taste, at first so\r\nperceptible, gradually diminishes and finally disappears; the sugar of\r\nthe sap is here changed into the _starch_ of the grain, which, as above\r\ndescribed, is afterwards destined, when the grain begins to sprout, to\r\nbe reconverted into sugar for the nourishment of the rising germ.\r\n\r\nIn the ripening of fruits a different series of changes presents\r\nitself. The fruit is first tasteless, then becomes sour, and at last\r\nsweet. In this case the acid of the unripe is changed into the sugar of\r\nthe ripened fruit.\r\n\r\nThe substance of plants,—their solid parts that is—consist chiefly of\r\n_woody fibre_, the name given to the fibrous substance, of which wood\r\nevidently consists. It is interesting to inquire how this substance\r\ncan be formed from the compounds, carbonic acid and water, of which the\r\nfood of plants in great measure consists. Nor is it difficult to find\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the leaf drinks in carbonic acid from the\r\nair, and delivers back its oxygen, retaining only its carbon. It is\r\nalso known that water abounds in the sap. Hence carbon and water are\r\nthus abundantly present in the pores or vessels of the green leaf. Now,\r\nwoody fibre _consists only of carbon and water_ chemically combined\r\ntogether,—100 lbs. of dry woody fibre consisting of 50 lbs. of carbon\r\nand 50 lbs. of water. It is easy, therefore, to see how, when the\r\ncarbon and water meet in the leaf, woody fibre may be produced by their\r\nmutual combination.\r\n\r\nIf, again, we inquire how this important principle of plants may be\r\nformed from the other substances, which enter by their roots, from the\r\nulmic acid, for example, the answer is equally ready. This acid also\r\nconsists of carbon and water only, 50 lbs. of carbon with 37½ of water\r\nforming ulmic acid, so that when it is introduced into the sap of the\r\nplant, all the materials are present from which the woody fibre may be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nNor is it more difficult to see how starch may be converted into sugar,\r\nand this again into woody fibre; or how, again, sugar may be converted\r\ninto starch in the ear of corn, or woody fibre into sugar during the\r\nripening of the winter pear after its removal from the tree. _Any one\r\nof these substances may be represented by carbon and water only._ Thus,—\r\n\r\n    50 lbs. of carbon with 50      of water, make 100   of woody fibre.\r\n\r\n    50 lbs.                37½                     87½  of ulmic acid.\r\n\r\n                                                        { of cane sugar,\r\n    50 lbs.                72½                    122½  { of starch, or\r\n                                                        { of gum.\r\n\r\n    50 lbs.                56                     106   of vinegar.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the plant, therefore, it is obvious that, whichever\r\nof these substances be present in the sap, the elements are at hand out\r\nof which any of the others may be produced. In what way they really\r\nare produced, the one from the other, and by what circumstances these\r\ntransformations are favoured, it would lead into too great detail to\r\nattempt here to explain.[6]\r\n\r\nWe cannot help admiring to what varied purposes in nature the\r\nsame elements are applied, and from how few and simple materials,\r\nsubstances, the most varied in their properties, are in the living\r\nvegetable daily produced.\r\n\r\n[6] For fuller and more precise explanations on these interesting\r\ntopics, see the Author’s LECTURES _on Agricultural Chemistry and\r\nGeology_, Part I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of the Inorganic Constitution of Plants—Their\r\n        immediate Source—Their Nature—Quantity of each in\r\n        certain common Crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—SOURCE OF THE EARTHY MATTER OF PLANTS—SUBSTANCES OF WHICH IT\r\nCONSISTS.\r\n\r\nWhen plants are burned, they always leave more or less of ash behind.\r\nThis ash varies in quantity in different plants, in different parts of\r\nthe same plant, and sometimes in different specimens of the same kind\r\nof plant, especially if grown upon different soils; yet it is never\r\nwholly absent. It seems as necessary to their existence in a state of\r\nperfect health as any of the elements which constitute the organic or\r\ncombustible part of their substance. They must obtain it therefore\r\nalong with the food on which they live: it is in fact a part of their\r\nnatural food, since without it they become unhealthy. We shall speak of\r\nit therefore as the _inorganic food_ of plants.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that all the elements which are necessary to the\r\nproduction of the woody fibre, and of the other organic parts of the\r\nplant, may be derived either from the air, from the carbonic acid\r\nand watery vapour taken in by the leaves, or from the soil, through\r\nthe medium of the roots. In the air, however, only rare particles of\r\ninorganic or earthy matter are known to float, and these in a solid\r\nform, so as to be unable to enter by the leaves; the earthy matter\r\nwhich constitutes the ash, therefore, must be all derived from the soil.\r\n\r\nThe earthy part of the soil, therefore, serves a double use. It is not\r\nmerely, as some have supposed, a substratum in which the plant may so\r\nfix and root itself, as to be able to maintain its upright position\r\nagainst the force of winds and tempests; but it is a storehouse of\r\nfood also, from which the roots of the plant may select such earthy\r\nsubstances as are necessary to, or are fitted to promote, its growth.\r\n\r\nThe ash of plants consists of a mixture of several, sometimes of as\r\nmany as eleven, different earthy substances. These substances are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n1. _Potash._—The common pearl-ash of the shops is a compound of potash\r\nwith carbonic acid; it is a _carbonate of potash_. By dissolving the\r\npearl-ash in water, and boiling it with quicklime, the carbonic acid is\r\nseparated, and potash alone, or caustic potash, as it is often called,\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\n2. _Soda._—The common soda of the shops is a carbonate of soda, and by\r\nboiling it with quicklime, the carbonic acid is separated, as in the\r\ncase of pearl-ash.\r\n\r\n3. _Lime._—This is familiar to every one as the lime-shells, or\r\nunslaked lime of the limekilns. The unburned limestone is a _carbonate\r\nof lime_; the carbonic acid in this case being separated by the\r\nroasting in the kiln.\r\n\r\n4. _Magnesia._—This is the calcined magnesia of the shops. The\r\nuncalcined is a _carbonate of magnesia_, from which heat drives off the\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\n5. _Silica._—This is the name given by chemists to the substance of\r\nflint, quartz, and of siliceous sands and sandstones.\r\n\r\n6. _Alumina_ is the pure earth of alum, obtained by dissolving alum in\r\nwater, and adding liquid ammonia (hartshorn) to the solution. It forms\r\nabout two-fifths of the weight of porcelain and pipe-clays, and of some\r\nother very stiff kinds of clay.\r\n\r\n7. _Oxide of Iron._—The most familiar form of this substance is the\r\nrust that forms on metallic iron in damp places. It is a compound of\r\niron with oxygen, hence the name _oxide_.\r\n\r\n8. _Oxide of Manganese_ is a brown powder, which consists of oxygen\r\nin combination with a metal resembling iron, to which the name of\r\nmanganese is given. It exists in plants, and in soils only in very\r\nsmall quantity.\r\n\r\n9. _Sulphur._—This substance is well known. It generally exists in\r\nthe ash in the state of _sulphuric acid_ (oil of vitriol), which is a\r\ncompound of sulphur with oxygen. It does not always exist in living\r\nplants, however, in this state.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ forms with potash a _sulphate of potash_,—with soda,\r\n_sulphate of soda_ (or Glauber’s salts),—with lime, _sulphate of lime_\r\n(gypsum),—with magnesia, _sulphate of magnesia_ (Epsom salts),—with\r\nalumina, _sulphate of alumina_,—and with oxide of iron, _sulphate of\r\niron_ or green vitriol. When the sulphate of potash is combined with\r\nsulphate of alumina, it forms common alum.\r\n\r\n10. _Phosphorus_ is a soft pale yellow substance which readily takes\r\nfire in the air, and gives off, while burning, a dense white smoke. The\r\nwhite fumes which form this smoke are a compound of phosphorus with\r\noxygen obtained from the air, and are called _phosphoric acid_. In the\r\nash of plants the phosphorus is found in the state of phosphoric acid,\r\nthough it probably does not all exist in the living plant in that state.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid_ forms _phosphates_ with potash, soda, lime, and\r\nmagnesia. When bones are burned, a large quantity of a white earth\r\nremains (bone-earth), which is a _phosphate of lime_, consisting of\r\nlime and phosphoric acid. Phosphate of lime is generally present in the\r\nash of plants; phosphate of magnesia is contained most abundantly in\r\nthe ash of wheat and other varieties of grain.\r\n\r\n11. _Chlorine._—This is a very suffocating gas, which gives its\r\npeculiar smell to chloride of lime, and is used for bleaching and\r\ndisinfecting. It is readily obtained by pouring muriatic acid (spirit\r\nof salt) on the black oxide of manganese of the shops. In combination\r\nwith the metallic bases of potash, soda, lime, and magnesia, it forms\r\nthe _chlorides_ of potassium, sodium (common salt), calcium and\r\nmagnesium,[7] and in one or other of these states it generally enters\r\ninto the roots of plants, and exists in their ash.\r\n\r\n[7] Potash, soda, lime, and magnesia, are compounds of the metals here\r\nnamed with oxygen. It is a very striking fact, that the suffocating\r\ngas chlorine, when combined with sodium, a metal which takes fire when\r\nplaced upon water, should form the agreeable and necessary condiment,\r\n_common salt_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the inorganic substances usually found mixed or combined\r\ntogether in the ash of plants. It has already been observed, that the\r\nquantity of ash left by a given weight of vegetable matter varies\r\nwith a great many conditions. This fact deserves a more attentive\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUANTITY OF ASH.\r\n\r\n1. The quantity of ash yielded by _different plants_ is unlike. Thus\r\n1000 lbs. of\r\n\r\n    Wheat       leave 12 lbs.\r\n    Oats              26 lbs.\r\n    Turnips            8 lbs.\r\n    Red Clover        16 lbs.\r\n    Rye Grass         17 lbs.\r\n    Barley            25 lbs.\r\n    Potatoes           8 lbs.\r\n    Carrots            7 lbs.\r\n    White Clover      17 lbs.\r\n\r\nSo that the quantity of inorganic food required by different vegetables\r\nis greater or less according to their nature; and if a soil be of such\r\na kind that it can yield only a small quantity of this inorganic food,\r\nthen only those plants will grow well upon it which require the least.\r\nHence, trees may often grow where arable crops fail to thrive, because\r\nmany of them require and contain very little inorganic matter. Thus\r\nwhile 1000 lbs. of elm wood leave 19 lbs. and of poplar 20 lbs. of\r\nash, the same weight of the willow leaves only 4½ lbs., of the beech 4\r\nlbs., of the birch 3½ lbs., of different pines less than 3 lbs., and of\r\nthe oak only 2 lbs. of ash when burned.\r\n\r\n2. The quantity of inorganic matter varies in _different parts of the\r\nsame plant_. Thus while 1000 lbs. of the turnip root sliced and dried\r\nin the air leave 70 lbs. of ash, the dried leaves give 130 lbs.; and\r\nwhile the grain of wheat yields only 12 lbs., wheat straw will yield\r\n60 lbs. of earthy matter. So, though the willow and other _woods_\r\nleave little ash, as above stated, yet the willow leaf leaves 82 lbs.,\r\nthe beech leaf 42 lbs., the birch 50 lbs., the different pine leaves\r\n20 lbs. to 30 lbs., and the leaves of the elm as much as 120 lbs. of\r\nincombustible matter when burned in the air.\r\n\r\nMost of the inorganic matter, therefore, which is withdrawn from\r\nthe soil in a crop of corn is returned to it again, by the skilful\r\nhusbandman, in the fermented straw,—in the same way as nature, in\r\ncausing the trees periodically to shed their leaves, returns with them\r\nto the soil a very large portion of the soluble inorganic substances\r\nwhich had been drawn from it by the roots during the season of growth.\r\n\r\nThus an annual top-dressing is given to the land where forests grow;\r\nand that which the roots from spring to autumn are continually sucking\r\nup, and carefully collecting from considerable depths, winter strews\r\nagain on the surface, so as, in the lapse of time, to form a soil\r\nwhich cannot fail to prove fertile,—because it is made up of those\r\nvery materials of which the inorganic substance of former races of\r\nvegetables has been entirely composed.\r\n\r\n2. The quantity of inorganic matter often differs in _different\r\nspecimens of the same plant_. Thus, 1000 lbs. of wheat straw, grown at\r\ndifferent places, gave to four different experimenters 43, 44, 35, and\r\n155 lbs. of ash respectively. Wheat straw, therefore, does not always\r\nleave the same quantity of ash.\r\n\r\nTo what is this difference owing? Is it to the nature of the soil, or\r\ndoes it depend upon the _variety_ of wheat experimented upon? It seems\r\nto depend partly upon both. Thus, on the same field, in Ravensworth\r\ndale, Yorkshire, on a rich clay soil abounding in lime, the _Golden\r\nKent_ and _Flanders Red_ wheats were sown in the spring of 1841. The\r\nformer gave an excellent crop, while the latter was a total failure,\r\nthe ear containing 20 or 30 grains only of poor wheat. The straw of the\r\nformer left 165 lbs. of ash from 1000 lbs., that of the latter only 120\r\nlbs. Something, therefore, depends upon the variety. But as from the\r\nstraw of a good wheat crop grown near Durham this last summer on a clay\r\nloam I obtained only 66 lbs. of ash, I am persuaded that the very wide\r\nvariations in the quantity of ash left, by different wheat straws, must\r\nbe dependent in some considerable degree upon the soil.\r\n\r\nThe truth, so far as it can as yet be made out, seems to be this—that\r\nevery plant must have a certain quantity of inorganic matter to make it\r\ngrow in the most healthy manner;—that it is capable of living, growing,\r\nand even ripening seed with very much less than this quantity;—but\r\nthat those soils will produce the most perfect plants which can best\r\nsupply all their wants,—and that the best seed will be raised in those\r\ndistricts where the soil, without being too rich or rank, yet can yield\r\nboth organic and inorganic food in such proportions as to maintain the\r\ncorn plants in their most healthy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE QUALITY OF THE ASH OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nBut much also depends upon the _quality_ as well as upon the _quantity_\r\nof the ash. Plants may leave the same weight of ash when burned, and\r\nyet the nature of the two specimens of ash, the kind of matter of\r\nwhich they respectively consist, may be very different. The ash of one\r\nmay contain much lime, of another much potash, of a third much soda,\r\nwhile in a fourth much silica may be present. Thus 100 lbs. of the ash\r\nof _bean_ straw contain 53½ lbs. of potash, while that of _barley_\r\nstraw contains only 3½ lbs. in the hundred; and, on the other hand, the\r\nsame weight of the ash of the latter contains 73½ lbs. of silica, while\r\nin that of the former there are only 7½ lbs.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the ash seems to vary with the same conditions by which\r\nits quantity is affected. Thus—\r\n\r\n1. It varies with the kind of plant. 100 lbs. of the ash of wheat,\r\nbarley, and oats, for example, contain, respectively,\r\n\r\n                     Wheat.    Barley.      Oats.\r\n\r\n    Potash,            19         12          6\r\n    Soda,              20½        12          5\r\n    Lime,               8          4½         3\r\n    Magnesia,           8          8          2½\r\n    Alumina,            2          1           ½\r\n    Oxide of Iron,      0        trace.       1½\r\n    Silica,            34         50         76½\r\n    Sulphuric acid,     4          2½         1½\r\n    Phosphoric acid,    3½         9          3\r\n    Chlorine,           1          1           ½\r\n                     ---------  ---------  ---------\r\n                       100        100        100\r\n\r\nA comparison of the several numbers opposite to each other in these\r\nthree columns, shews how unlike the quantities of the different\r\nsubstances are, which are contained in an equal weight of the ash of\r\nthese three varieties of grain. The ash of wheat contains 19 lbs. of\r\npotash in the 100 lbs., while that of oats contains only 6 lbs. In\r\nwheat are 20½ per cent. of soda, in oats only 5 per cent. Wheat also\r\ncontains more sulphuric acid than either of the other grains, while\r\nbarley contains a still greater predominance of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that a crop of wheat will carry off from the\r\nsoil—even suppose the whole _quantity_ of ash left by each the same in\r\nweight—very different quantities of potash, soda, &c. from a crop of\r\noats. It will take more of these, of sulphuric acid, and of certain\r\nother substances, from the soil. It will, therefore, exhaust the soil\r\nmore of _these_ substances—as barley and oats will of others—hence\r\n_one_ reason why a piece of land may suit one of these crops and not\r\nsuit the others. That which cannot grow wheat may yet grow oats.\r\nHence, also, two successive crops of _different_ kinds of grain may\r\ngrow where it would greatly injure the soil to take two in succession\r\nof the _same_ kind, especially of either wheat or barley; and hence\r\nwe likewise deduce one natural reason for a rotation of crops. The\r\nsurface soil may be so far exhausted of one inorganic substance, that\r\nit cannot afford it in sufficient quantity during the present season\r\nto bring a given crop to healthy maturity, and yet may, by natural\r\nprocesses, be so far supplied again, during the intermediate growth\r\nof certain other crops, as to be prepared in a future season fully to\r\nsupply all the wants of the same crop, and to yield a plentiful harvest.\r\n\r\n2. The kind of inorganic matter varies with the _part_ of the plant.\r\nThus the grain and the straw of the corn plants contain very unlike\r\nquantities of the several inorganic constituents, as will appear by\r\ncomparing the following with the preceding table:—\r\n\r\n                         Wheat   Barley    Oat\r\n                         Straw.  Straw.   Straw.\r\n    Potash,                 ½      3½       15\r\n    Soda,                   ¾      1       trace.\r\n    Lime,                  7      10½        2¾\r\n    Magnesia,              1       1½         ½\r\n    Alumina,               2¾      3       trace.\r\n\r\n    Oxide of Iron,      }\r\n    Oxide of manganese, }  0        ½      trace.\r\n\r\n    Silica,               81      73½       80\r\n    Sulphuric acid,        1       2         1½\r\n    Phosphoric acid,       5       3          ¼\r\n    Chlorine,              1       1½       trace.\r\n                        -------  -------   --------\r\n                          100     100         100\r\n\r\nNot only are the quantities of the several inorganic substances kinds\r\nof straw very unlike—especially the proportions of potash, lime, and\r\nphosphoric acid in each—but these quantities are also very different\r\nfrom those exhibited by the numbers in the preceding table as contained\r\nin the three varieties of grain. In this difference we see, further,\r\n_one_ reason why the same soil which may be favourable to the growth\r\nof straw may not be equally propitious to the growth of the ear. Wheat\r\nstraw contains little either of potash or of soda; the ash of the\r\ngrain contains a large proportion; while the ash of the oat-straw,\r\non the other hand, contains a much larger proportion of potash than\r\nthat of its own ear does. It is clear, therefore, that the roots may,\r\nin certain plants and in certain soils, succeed in fully nourishing\r\nthe straw while they cannot fully ripen the ear; or contrariwise,\r\nwhere they feed but a scanty straw, may yet _be able_ to give ample\r\nsustenance to the filling ear.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] And occasionally _do_ give; for a plump grain, and even a\r\nwell-filled ear, are not unfrequently found where the straw is\r\nunusually deficient.\r\n\r\n3. The quality of the ash varies also with the soil in which it grows.\r\nThis will be understood from what is stated above. Where the soil is\r\nfavourable, the roots can send up into the straw every thing which the\r\nhealthy plant requires; when it is poorly supplied with some of those\r\ninorganic constituents which the plant desires, life may be prolonged,\r\na stunted or unhealthy crop may be raised, in which the kind, and\r\nperhaps the quantity, of ash left in burning will necessarily be\r\ndifferent from that left by the same species of plant grown under more\r\nfavouring circumstances. Of this fact there can be no doubt, though\r\nthe extent to which such variations may take place without absolutely\r\nkilling the plant, has not yet been by any means made out.\r\n\r\n4. It varies also with the period of a plant’s growth, or the season at\r\nwhich it is reaped. Thus, in the young leaf of the turnip and potato,\r\na greater proportion of the inorganic matter they contain consists of\r\npotash than in the old leaf. The same is true of the stalk of wheat;\r\nand similar differences prevail in almost every kind of plant at\r\ndifferent stages of its growth.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened agriculturist will perceive that all the facts above\r\nstated have a perceptible connection with the ordinary processes of\r\npractical agriculture, and tend to throw considerable light on some of\r\nthe principles by which they ought to be regulated. One illustration of\r\nthis is exhibited in the following section.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—QUANTITY OF INORGANIC MATTER CONTAINED IN AN ORDINARY CROP\r\nOR SERIES OF CROPS.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the inorganic matter contained in living vegetables,\r\nor in vegetable substances when reaped and dry, will appear more\r\ndistinctly if we consider the actual quantity carried off from the soil\r\nin a series of crops.\r\n\r\nIn a four-years’ course of cropping, in which the crops gathered amount\r\nper acre to—\r\n\r\n    1st year, _Turnips_, 25 tons of bulbs, and 7 tons of tops.\r\n    2d year, _Barley_, 38 bushels of 63 lbs. each,\r\n                            and 1 ton of straw.\r\n    3d year, _Clover and Rye Grass_, 1 ton of each in hay.\r\n    4th year, _Wheat_, 25 bushels of 60 lbs., and 1¾ tons of straw.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of inorganic matter carried off in the four crops,\r\nsupposing none of them to be eaten on the land, amounts to—\r\n\r\n    Potash,          281 lbs.\r\n    Soda,            130  ”\r\n    Lime,            242  ”\r\n    Magnesia,         42  ”\r\n    Alumina,          11  ”\r\n    Silica,          318  ”\r\n    Sulphuric acid,  111  ”\r\n    Phosphoric acid,  61  ”\r\n    Chlorine,         39  ”\r\n                   --------\r\n    Total,           1240\r\n\r\nor, in all, about 11 cwt.—of which gross weight the different\r\nsubstances form very unlike proportions.\r\n\r\nA still clearer idea of these quantities will be obtained by a\r\nconsideration of the fact, that if we carry off the entire produce, and\r\nreturn none of it again in the shape of manure, we must or ought in its\r\nstead, if the land is to be restored to its original condition, add to\r\neach acre every four years:—\r\n\r\n    Pearl or Potash,                 390 lbs. at a cost of _l._3  10  0\r\n    Crystallized carbonate of soda,  440                       2   5  0\r\n    Common salt,                      65                       0   2  0\r\n    Quick (burned) lime,             240                       0   1  0\r\n    Epsom salts,                     250                       1   5  0\r\n    Alum,                             84                       0   8  0\r\n    Bone-dust,                       260                       0  16  0\r\n                                   ------                     ---------\r\n    Total,                          1729                   _l._8   7  0\r\n\r\nSeveral observations suggest themselves from a consideration of the\r\nabove statements: _first_, that if this inorganic matter be really\r\nnecessary to the plant, the gradual and constant removal of it from the\r\nland ought by-and-by to impoverish the soil of this inorganic food;\r\n_second_, that the more of what grows upon the land we can again return\r\nto it in manure, the less will this deterioration be perceptible;\r\n_third_, that as many of these inorganic substances are readily soluble\r\nin water, the liquid manure of the farm-yard, so often allowed to run\r\nto waste, carries with it to the rivers much of the saline matter\r\nthat ought to be returned to the land; and, _lastly_, that the utility\r\nand often indispensable necessity of certain artificial manures is\r\nowing, it may be, in some districts, to the natural poverty of the\r\nland in certain inorganic substances,—but more frequently to a want\r\nof acquaintance with the facts above stated, among practical men, and\r\nto the long continued neglect and waste which has been the natural\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nIn certain districts, the soil and subsoil contain within themselves\r\nan almost unfailing supply of some of these inorganic substances, so\r\nthat the waste is long in being felt; in others they become sooner\r\nexhausted, and hence call for more care, and, when exhausted, for a\r\nmore expensive cultivation, in order to replace them.\r\n\r\nOne thing is of essential importance to be remembered by the practical\r\nfarmer—that the deterioration of land is often an exceedingly slow\r\nprocess. In the hands of successive generations a field may so\r\nimperceptibly become less valuable, that a century even may elapse\r\nbefore the change prove such as to make a sensible diminution in the\r\nvalued rental. Such slow changes, however, have been seldom recorded;\r\nand hence the practical man is occasionally led to despise the clearest\r\ntheoretical principles, because he has not happened to see them\r\nverified in his own limited experience, and to neglect therefore the\r\nsuggestions and the wise precautions which these principles lay before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural history of tracts of land of different qualities,\r\nshewing how they had been cropped and tilled, and the average produce\r\nin grain, hay, straw, and other crops, every five years, during an\r\nentire century, would be invaluable materials both to theoretical and\r\nto practical agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of Soils—their Organic and Inorganic Portions—Saline\r\n        Matter in Soils—Examination and Classification of\r\n        Soils—Diversities of Soils and Subsoils.\r\n\r\nSoils consist of two parts,—of an _organic_ part, which can readily be\r\nburnt away when the soil is heated to redness; and of an _inorganic_\r\npart, which is fixed in the fire, and which consists entirely of earthy\r\nand saline substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF THE ORGANIC PART OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe organic part of soils is derived chiefly from the remains of\r\nvegetables and animals which have lived and died in or upon the soil,\r\nwhich have been spread over it by rivers and rains, or which have been\r\nadded by the hand of man for the purpose of increasing its natural\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nThis organic part varies very much in quantity in different soils. In\r\nsome, as in peaty soils, it forms from 50 to 70 per cent. of their\r\nwhole weight, and even in some rich long cultivated lands it has been\r\nfound, in a few rare cases, to amount to as much as 25 per cent. In\r\ngeneral, however, it is present in much smaller proportion, even in our\r\nbest arable lands. Oats and rye will grow upon a soil containing only\r\n1½ per cent., barley when 2 to 3 are present, while good wheat soils\r\ngenerally contain from 4 to 8 per cent. In stiff and very clayey soils\r\n10 to 12 per cent. may occasionally be detected. In very old pasture\r\nlands and in gardens, vegetable matter occasionally accumulates, so as\r\nto overload the upper soil.\r\n\r\nTo this organic matter in the soil the name of _humus_ has been given\r\nby some writers. It contains or yields to the plant the ulmic and\r\nhumic acids described in a previous chapter. It supplies also, by\r\nits decay, in contact with the air which penetrates the soil, much\r\ncarbonic acid, which is supposed to enter the roots and minister to the\r\ngrowth of living vegetables. During the same decay ammonia is likewise\r\nproduced,—and in larger quantity, if animal matter be present in\r\nconsiderable abundance,—which ammonia is found to promote vegetation\r\nin a remarkable manner. Other substances, more or less nutritious,\r\nare also formed from it in the soil. These enter by the roots, and\r\ncontribute to nourish the growing plant, though the extent to which\r\nit is fed from this source is dependent, both upon the abundance with\r\nwhich these substances are supplied, and upon the nature of the plant\r\nitself, and of the climate in which it grows.\r\n\r\nAnother influence of this organic portion of the soil, whether\r\nnaturally formed in it, or added to it as manure, is not to be\r\nneglected. It contains,—as we have seen that all vegetable substances\r\ndo,—a considerable quantity of inorganic, that is, of saline and earthy\r\nmatter, which is liberated as the organic part decays. Thus living\r\nplants derive from the remains of former races buried beneath the\r\nsurface, a portion of that inorganic food which can only be obtained\r\nin the soil,—and which, if not thus directly supplied, must be sought\r\nfor by the slow extension of their roots through a greater depth and\r\nbreadth of the earth in which they grow. The addition of manure to the\r\nsoil, therefore, places within the easy reach of the roots not only\r\norganic but inorganic food also.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE INORGANIC PART OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic part of soils,—that which remains behind, when every\r\nthing combustible is burned away by heating it to redness in the open\r\nair,—consists of two portions, one of which is _soluble_ in water, the\r\nother _insoluble_. The soluble consists of _saline_ substances, the\r\ninsoluble of _earthy_ substances.\r\n\r\n1. _The saline or soluble portion._—In this country the surface soil\r\nof our fields, in general, contains very little soluble matter. If a\r\nquantity of soil be dried in an oven, a pound weight of it taken, and\r\na pint and a half of pure boiling rain-water poured over it, the whole\r\nwell stirred and allowed to settle,—the clear liquid, when poured off\r\nand boiled to dryness, may leave from 2 to 20 grains of saline matter.\r\nThis saline matter will consist of common salt, gypsum, sulphate of\r\nsoda (Glauber’s salts), sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salts), with\r\ntraces of the chlorides of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and of\r\nthe nitrates of potash, soda, and lime.[9] It is from these soluble\r\nsubstances that the plants derive the greater portion of the saline\r\ningredients contained in the ash they leave when burned.\r\n\r\n[9] See pages 51 and 52, where these substances are described.\r\n\r\nNor must the quantity thus obtained from a soil be considered too small\r\nto yield the whole supply which a crop requires. A single grain of\r\nsaline matter in every pound of a soil a foot deep, is equal to 500\r\nlbs. in an acre, which is more than is carried off from the soil in\r\n10 rotations (40 years), where only the wheat and barley are sent to\r\nmarket, and the straw and green crops are regularly returned to the\r\nland in the manure.[10]\r\n\r\n[10] A further portion, it will be recollected, is carried off in the\r\ncattle that are sent to market,—this is here neglected.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, indeed in some districts of our own country, the\r\nquantity of saline matter in the soil is so great, as in hot seasons to\r\nform a distinct incrustation on the surface. This may often be seen in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Durham; and is more especially to be looked for\r\nin districts where the subsoil is sandy and porous, and more or less\r\nfull of water. In hot weather the evaporation on the surface causes\r\nthe water to ascend from the porous subsoil: and as this water always\r\nbrings with it a quantity of saline matter,—which it leaves behind when\r\nit rises in vapour,—it is evident that the longer the dry weather and\r\nthe consequent evaporation from the surface continue, the thicker the\r\nincrustations will be, or the greater the accumulation of saline matter\r\non the surface. Hence, where such a moist and porous subsoil exists in\r\ncountries rarely visited by rain, as in the plains of Peru, of Egypt,\r\nor of India, the country is whitened over in the dry season with an\r\nunbroken covering of the different saline substances above mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen rain falls, the saline matter is dissolved, and descends again to\r\nthe subsoil,—in dry weather it reascends. Thus the surface soil of any\r\nfield will contain a larger proportion of soluble inorganic matter in\r\nthe middle of a hot season than in one of even ordinary rain; and hence\r\nthe fine dry weather which, in early summer, hastens the growth of\r\ncorn, and later in the season favours its ripening, does so, among its\r\nother modes of action, by bringing up to the roots from beneath a more\r\nready supply of those saline compounds which the crop requires for its\r\nhealthful growth.\r\n\r\n2. _The earthy or insoluble portion._—The earthy or insoluble portion\r\nof soils rarely constitutes less than 95 lbs. in a hundred of their\r\nwhole weight. It consists chiefly of _silica_ in the form of _sand_,\r\nof _alumina_ in the form of _clay_, and of _lime_ in the form of\r\n_carbonate of lime_. It is rarely free, however, from one or two per\r\ncent. of oxide of iron; and where the soil is of a red colour, this\r\noxide is present in a still larger quantity. A trace of magnesia also\r\nmay be almost always detected, and a minute quantity of phosphate of\r\nlime. The principal ingredients, however, of the earthy part of all\r\nsoils are sand, clay, and lime; and soils are named or classified\r\naccording to the quantities of each of these three they may happen to\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nIf an ounce of soil be boiled in a pint of water till it is perfectly\r\nsoftened and diffused through it, and, after shaking, the heavy parts\r\nbe allowed to settle for a few minutes, the sand will subside, while\r\nthe clay—which is in finer particles, and is less heavy—will still\r\nremain floating. If the water and clay be now poured into another\r\nvessel, and be allowed to stand till the water has become clear, the\r\nsandy part of the soil will be on the bottom of the one vessel, the\r\nclayey part on that of the other, and they may be dried and weighed\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nIf 100 grains of dry soil leave no more than 10 of clay, it is called\r\na _sandy soil_; if from 10 to 40, a _sandy loam_; if from 40 to 70, a\r\n_loamy soil_; if from 70 to 85, a _clay loam_; from 85 to 95, a _strong\r\nclay soil_; and when no sand is separated at all by this process, it is\r\na pure _agricultural clay_.\r\n\r\nThe _strong clay soils_ are such as are used for making tiles and\r\nbricks; the pure _agricultural clay_ is such as is commonly employed\r\nfor the manufacture of pipes (pipe-clay).\r\n\r\nSoils consist of these three substances _mixed_ together. The pure\r\n_clay_ is a chemical _compound_ of silica and alumina, in the\r\nproportion of about 60 of the former to 40 of the latter. Pure clay\r\nsoils rarely occur—it being well known to all practical men, that the\r\nstrong clays (tile clays) which contain from 5 to 15 per cent. of\r\nsand, are brought into arable cultivation with the greatest possible\r\ndifficulty. It will rarely happen, therefore, that arable land will\r\ncontain more than 30 to 35 of alumina.\r\n\r\nIf a soil contain more than 5 per cent. of carbonate of lime, it is\r\ncalled a _marl_; if more than 20 per cent., it is a _calcareous_ soil.\r\n_Peaty soils_, of course, are those in which the vegetable matter\r\npredominates very much.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the lime, a quantity of the soil should be burned in the\r\nair, and a weighed portion, 100 or 200 grains, diffused through half a\r\npint of cold water mixed with half a wine glassful of spirit of salt\r\n(muriatic acid), and allowed to stand for a couple of hours, with\r\noccasional stirring. The water is then poured off, the soil dried,\r\nheated to redness as before, and weighed: the loss is nearly all\r\nlime.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Unless the soil happen to contain a large quantity of magnesia,\r\nwhich is rarely the case.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of vegetable or other organic matter is determined by\r\ndrying the soil _well_ upon paper in an oven, and then burning a\r\nweighed quantity in the air: the loss is _nearly all_ organic matter.\r\nIn stiff clays this loss will comprise a portion of water, which is\r\nnot wholly driven off from such soils by drying upon paper in the way\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE DIVERSITIES OF SOILS AND SUBSOILS.\r\n\r\nThough the substances of which soils _chiefly_ consist are so few in\r\nnumber, yet every practical man knows how very diversified they are\r\nin character—how very different in agricultural value. Thus, in some\r\nof our southern counties, we have a white soil, consisting apparently\r\nof nothing else but chalk; in the centre of England a wide plain of\r\ndark red land; in the border counties of Wales, and on many of our\r\ncoal-fields, tracts of country almost perfectly black; while yellow,\r\nwhite, and brown sands give the prevailing character to the soils of\r\nother districts. Such differences as these arise from the different\r\nproportions in which the sand, lime, clay, and the oxide of iron which\r\ncolours the soils, have been mixed together.\r\n\r\nBut how have they been so mixed—differently in different parts of the\r\ncountry. By what natural agency?—for what end?\r\n\r\nAgain, the soil on the surface rests on what is usually denominated the\r\n_subsoil_. This, also, is very various in its character and quality.\r\nSometimes it is a porous sand or gravel, through which water readily\r\nascends from beneath or sinks in from above; sometimes it is light and\r\nloamy like the soil that rests upon it; sometimes stiff and impervious\r\nto water.\r\n\r\nThe most ignorant farmer knows how much the value of a piece of land\r\ndepends upon the characters of the surface soil,—the intelligent\r\nimprover understands best the importance of a favourable subsoil. “When\r\nI came to look at this farm,” said an excellent agriculturist to me,\r\n“it was spring, and damp growing weather: the grass was beautifully\r\ngreen, the clover shooting up strong and healthy, and the whole farm\r\nhad the appearance of being very good land. Had I come in June, when\r\nthe heat had drunk up nearly all the moisture which the _sandy subsoil_\r\nhad left in the surface, I should not have offered so much rent for\r\nit by ten shillings an acre.” He might have said also, “Had I taken a\r\nspade, and dug down 18 inches in various parts of the farm, I should\r\nhave known what to expect in seasons of drought.”\r\n\r\nBut how come subsoils thus to differ—one from the other—and from the\r\nsurface soil that rests upon them? Are there any principles by which\r\nsuch differences can be accounted for—by which they can be foreseen—by\r\nthe aid of which we can tell what kind of soil may be expected in this\r\nor that district—even without visiting the spot—and on what kind of\r\nsubsoil it is likely to rest?\r\n\r\nGeology explains the cause of all such differences, and supplies us\r\nwith principles by which we can predict the general quality of the soil\r\nand subsoil in the several parts of entire kingdoms;—and where the soil\r\nis of inferior quality and yet susceptible of improvement, the same\r\nprinciples indicate whether the means of improving it are likely, in\r\nany given locality, to be attainable at a reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper shortly to illustrate these direct relations of\r\ngeology to agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Direct relations of Geology to Agriculture—Origin\r\n        of Soils—Causes of their Diversity—Relation to\r\n        the Rocks on which they rest—Constancy in the\r\n        relative Position and Character of the Stratified\r\n        Rocks—Relation of this fact to Practical\r\n        Agriculture—General Character of the Soils upon\r\n        these Rocks.\r\n\r\nGeology is that branch of knowledge which embodies all ascertained\r\nfacts in regard to the nature and internal structure, both physical and\r\nchemical, of the solid parts of our globe. This science has many close\r\nrelations with practical agriculture, and especially throws much light\r\non the nature and origin of soils,—on the cause of their diversity,—on\r\nthe kind of materials by the admixture of which they may be permanently\r\nimproved,—and on the sources from which these materials may be derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF THE ORIGIN OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nIf we dig down through the soil and subsoil to a sufficient depth, we\r\nalways come sooner or later to the solid rock. In many places the rock\r\nactually reaches the surface, or rises in cliffs, hills, or ridges,\r\nfar above it. The surface (or crust) of our globe, therefore, consists\r\neverywhere of a solid mass of rock, overlaid with a covering, generally\r\nthin, of loose materials. The upper or outer part of these loose\r\nmaterials forms the soil.\r\n\r\nThe geologist has travelled over great part of the earth’s surface,\r\nhas examined the nature of the rocks, which everywhere repose beneath\r\nthe soil, and has found them to be very unlike in character, in\r\ncomposition, and in hardness—in different countries and districts. In\r\nsome places he has met with a sandstone, in other places a limestone,\r\nin others a slate or hardened rock of clay. But a careful comparison\r\nof all the kinds of rock he has observed, has led him to the general\r\nconclusion, _that they are all either sandstones, limestones, or clays\r\nof different degrees of hardness, or a mixture in different proportions\r\nof two or more of these kinds of matter_.\r\n\r\nWhen the loose covering of earth is removed from the surface of any of\r\nthese rocks, and it is left exposed, summer and winter, to the action\r\nof the winds and rains and frosts, it may be seen gradually to crumble\r\naway. Such is the case even with many of those which, on account of\r\ntheir greater hardness, are employed as building-stones, and are kept\r\ngenerally dry; how much more with such as are less hard, and, beneath\r\na covering of moist earth, are continually exposed to the action of\r\nwater. The natural crumbling of a naked rock thus gradually covers\r\nit with loose materials, in which seeds fix themselves and vegetate,\r\nand which eventually forms a soil. The soil thus produced partakes\r\nnecessarily of the character of the rock on which it rests, and to the\r\ncrumbling of which it owes its origin. If the rock be a sandstone the\r\nsoil is sandy; if a claystone, it is a more or less stiff clay; if a\r\nlimestone, it is more or less calcareous; and if the rock consist of\r\nany peculiar mixture of those three substances, a similar mixture is\r\nobserved in the earthy matter into which it has crumbled.\r\n\r\nLed by this observation, the geologist, after comparing the rocks\r\nof different countries with one another, compared next the soils of\r\nvarious districts with the rocks on which they immediately rest. The\r\n_general_ result of this comparison has been, that in almost every\r\ncountry the soils have as close a resemblance to the rocks beneath\r\nthem—as the loose earth derived from the crumbling of a rock before\r\nour eyes, bears to the rock of which it lately formed a part. The\r\nconclusion therefore is irresistible, that soils, generally speaking,\r\nhave been formed by the crumbling or decay of the solid rocks,—that\r\nthere was a time when these rocks were uncovered by any loose\r\nmaterials,—and that the accumulation of soil has been the slow result\r\nof the natural degradation (wearing away) of the solid crust of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—CAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the diversity of soils in different districts, therefore,\r\nis no longer obscure. If the subjacent rocks in two localities differ,\r\nthe soils met with there must differ also, and in an equal degree.\r\n\r\nBut why, it may be asked, do we find the soil in some countries\r\nuniform, in mineral[12] character and general fertility, over hundreds\r\nor thousands of square miles, while in others it varies from field to\r\nfield,—the same farm often presenting many well marked differences both\r\nin mineral character and in agricultural value? The cause of this is to\r\nbe found in the mode in which the different rocks are observed to lie,\r\none upon or by the side of the other.\r\n\r\n[12] That is, containing the same general proportions of sand, clay,\r\nlime, &c., or coloured red by similar quantities of oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nGeologists distinguish rocks into two classes, the _stratified_ and the\r\n_unstratified_. The former are found lying over each other in separate\r\nbeds or _strata_, like the leaves of a book, when laid on its side,\r\nor like the layers of stones in the wall of a building; the latter\r\nform hills, mountains, or sometimes ridges of mountains, consisting\r\nof one more or less solid mass of the same material, in which no\r\nlayers or strata are any where distinctly perceptible. Thus, in the\r\nfollowing diagram, (No. 1), A and B represent _unstratified_ masses,\r\nin connection with a series of _stratified_ deposits, 1, 2, 3, lying\r\nover each other in a horizontal position. On A one kind of soil will be\r\nformed, on C another, on B a third, and on D a fourth,—the rocks being\r\nall different from each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 1.]\r\n\r\nIf from A to D be a wide valley of many miles in extent, the undulating\r\nplain at the bottom of the valley, resting in great part on the same\r\nrock (2), will be covered by a similar soil. On B the soil will be\r\ndifferent for a short space; and again at C, and on the first ascent to\r\nA, where the rock (3) rises to the surface. In this case the stratified\r\nrocks lie horizontally; and it is the undulating nature of the country\r\nwhich, bringing different kinds of rock to the surface, causes a\r\nnecessary diversity of soil.\r\n\r\nBut the degree of _inclination_, which the beds possess, is a more\r\nfrequent cause of variation in the characters of the soil in the same\r\ndistrict, and even at shorter distances. This is shewn in the annexed\r\ndiagram (No. 2), where A, B, C, D, E, represent the mode in which the\r\nstratified rocks of a district of country not unfrequently occur in\r\nconnection with each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 2.]\r\n\r\nProceeding from E in the plain, the soil would change when we came upon\r\nthe rock D, but would then continue uniform till we reached the layer\r\nC. Each of these layers may stretch over a comparatively level tract of\r\nperhaps hundreds of miles in extent. Again, on climbing the hill-side,\r\nanother soil would present itself, which would not change till we\r\narrived at B. Then, however, we begin to walk over the edges of the\r\nbeds, and the soil may vary with every new _stratum_ (or bed) we pass\r\nover, till we gain the ascent to A, where the beds are much thinner,\r\nand where, therefore, still more frequent variations may present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nEverywhere over the British islands valleys are hollowed out, as in\r\nthe former of these diagrams (No. 1), by which the rocks beneath are\r\nexposed, and differences of soil produced,—or the beds are more or less\r\ninclined, as in the latter diagram (No. 2), causing still more frequent\r\nvariations of the land to appear. By a reference to these facts, nearly\r\nall the _great_ diversities which the soils of the country present may\r\nbe satisfactorily accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE CONSTANCY IN THE CHARACTER AND ORDER OF SUCCESSION\r\nOF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n\r\nAnother fact alike important to agriculture and to geology, is the\r\nnatural order or mode of arrangement in which the stratified rocks\r\nare observed to occur in the crust of the globe. Thus, if 1, 2, 3, in\r\ndiagram No. 1 represent three different kinds of rock, a limestone, for\r\nexample, a sandstone, and a hard clay rock (a shale or slate), lying\r\nover each other, in the order here represented; then, in whatever part\r\nof the country nay, in whatever part of the world, these same rocks are\r\nmet with, they will always be found in the same relative position. The\r\nbed 2 or 3 will never be observed to lie over the bed 1.\r\n\r\nThis fact is important to geology, because it enables this science to\r\narrange all the stratified rocks in a certain invariable order,—which\r\norder indicates their relative age or antiquity,—since that which is\r\nlowest, like the lowest layer of stones in the wall of a building, must\r\ngenerally have been the first deposited, or must be the oldest. It also\r\nenables the geologist, on observing the kind of rock which forms the\r\nsurface in any country, to predict at once, whether certain other rocks\r\nare likely to be met with in that country or not. Thus at C (diagram,\r\nNo. 1), where the rock (3) comes to the surface, he knows it would be\r\nin vain, either by sinking or otherwise, to seek for the rock (1), the\r\nnatural place of which is far above it; while at D he knows that by\r\nsinking he is likely to find either 2 or 3, if it be worth his while to\r\nseek for them.\r\n\r\nTo the agriculturist this fact is important, among other reasons,—\r\n\r\n1. Because it enables him to predict whether certain kinds of rock,\r\nwhich might be used with advantage in improving his soil, are likely\r\nto be met with within a reasonable distance or at an accessible depth.\r\nThus if the bed D (diagram No. 2) be a limestone, the instructed farmer\r\nat E knows that it is not to be found by sinking into his own land,\r\nand, therefore, brings it from D; while, to the farmer upon C, it may\r\nbe less expensive to dig down to the bed D in one of his own fields,\r\nthan to cart it from a distant spot where it occurs on the surface. Or\r\nif the farmer requires clay, or marl, or sand, to ameliorate his soil,\r\nthis knowledge of the constant relative position of beds enables him to\r\nsay where these materials are to be got, or where they are to be looked\r\nfor, and whether the advantage to be derived is likely to repay the\r\ncost of procuring them.\r\n\r\n2. It is observed, that when the soil on the surface of each of a\r\nseries of rocks, such as C, or D, or E, in the same diagram, is\r\nuniformly bad, it is almost invariably of better quality at the point\r\nwhere the two rocks meet. Thus C may be dry, sandy, and barren; D may\r\nbe cold, unproductive clay; and E a more or less unfruitful limestone\r\nsoil: yet at either extremity of the tract D, where the soil is made up\r\nof an admixture of the decayed portions of the two adjacent rocks, the\r\nland may be of average fertility—the sand of C may adapt the adjacent\r\nclay to the growth of turnips, while the lime of E may cause it to\r\nyield large returns of wheat.[13] Thus, to the tenant in looking out\r\nfor a farm, or to the capitalist in seeking an eligible investment, a\r\nknowledge of the mutual relations of geology and agriculture will often\r\nprove of the greatest assistance. Yet how little is such really useful\r\nknowledge diffused among either class of men—how little are either\r\ntenants or proprietors guided by it in their choice of the localities\r\nin which they desire to live!\r\n\r\n[13] See page 94.\r\n\r\nAnd yet here and there the agricultural practice of more or less\r\nextended districts, if not really founded upon or directed by, is\r\nyet to be explained only by principles such as those I have above\r\nillustrated. I shall mention only one example. The chalk in Yorkshire,\r\nin Suffolk, and in other southern counties, consists of a vast number\r\nof beds, which, taken all together, form a deposit of very great\r\nthickness. Now, the upper beds of the chalk form poor, thin, dry soils,\r\nproducing a scanty herbage, and only under the most skilful culture\r\nyielding profitable crops of corn. The lower beds, on the contrary,\r\nare marly; produce a more stiff, tenacious, and even fertile soil;\r\nand are found in a remarkable degree to enrich the soils of the upper\r\nchalk, when laid on as a top-dressing in autumn, and allowed to crumble\r\nunder the action of the winter’s frost. Hence in Yorkshire, Wiltshire,\r\nHampshire, and Kent, where the lower chalk covers the surface, or is\r\nfound at no great depth beneath it, it is dug out of the sides of the\r\nhills, or pits are sunk for it, and it is immediately laid upon the\r\nland with great benefit to the soil. But in parts of Suffolk, where the\r\nsoil equally rests upon the upper chalk, there is no other chalk in the\r\nneighbourhood, or to be met with at any reasonable depth, which will\r\nmaterially improve the land. The farmers find it, from long experience,\r\nto be more economical to bring chalk by sea from Kent to lay on their\r\nlands in Suffolk, than to cover them with any portion of the same\r\nmaterial from their own farms. The following imaginary section will\r\nfully explain the fact here mentioned:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 3.\r\n\r\nSuffolk. Mouth of the Thames. Kent.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn this diagram 1 represents the London clay; 2, the plastic clay which\r\nis below it; 3, the upper chalk with flints, rising to the surface in\r\nSuffolk; and 4, the lower chalk, without flints, which is too deep to\r\nbe reached in Suffolk, but which rises to the surface in Kent,—where it\r\nis abundant, is easily accessible, and whence it is transmitted across\r\nthe estuary of the Thames into Suffolk.\r\n\r\n3. The further fact that the several stratified rocks are remarkably\r\nconstant in their mineral character, renders this knowledge of\r\nthe order of relative superposition still more valuable to the\r\nagriculturist. Thousands of different beds are known to geologists\r\nto occur on various parts of the earth’s surface—each occupying its\r\nown unvarying place in the series. Most of these beds also, when they\r\ncrumble or are worn down, produce soils possessed of some peculiarity\r\nby which their general agricultural capabilities are more or less\r\naffected,—and these peculiarities may generally be observed in soils\r\nformed from rocks of the same age—that is, occupying the same place in\r\nthe series—in whatever part of the world we find them. Hence if the\r\nagricultural geologist be informed that his friend has bought, or is\r\nin treaty for a farm or an estate, and that it is situated upon such\r\nand such a rock, or geological formation, he can immediately give a\r\nvery probable opinion in regard to the agricultural value of the soil,\r\nwhether the property be in England, in Australia, or in New Zealand. If\r\nhe knows the nature of the climate also, he will be able to estimate\r\nwith tolerable correctness how far the soil is likely to repay the\r\nlabours of the practical farmer,—nay, even whether it is likely to suit\r\nbetter for arable land or for pasture, and if for arable, what species\r\nof white crops it may be expected to produce most abundantly.\r\n\r\nThese facts are so very curious, and illustrate so beautifully\r\nthe value of geological knowledge—if not to A and B, the holders\r\nor proprietors of this and that small farm, yet to enlightened\r\nagriculturists,—to scientific agriculture in general,—that I shall\r\nexplain this part of the subject more fully in a separate section.\r\nTo those who are now embarking in such numbers in quest of new\r\nhomes in our numerous colonies, who hope to find, if not a more\r\nwilling, at least a more attainable soil in new countries, no kind\r\nof agricultural knowledge can at the outset,—I may say, even through\r\nlife,—be so valuable as that to which the rudiments of geology will\r\nlead them. Those who prepare themselves the best for becoming farmers\r\nor proprietors in Canada, in New Zealand, or in wide Australia,\r\nyet leave their native land in general without a particle of that\r\npreliminary _practical_ knowledge, which would qualify them to say,\r\nwhen they reach the land of their adoption, “On this spot, rather than\r\nthat,—in this district, rather than that,—will I purchase my allotment,\r\nbecause, though both appear equally inviting, yet I know from the\r\ngeological structure of the country, that here I shall have the more\r\npermanently productive soil; here I am more within reach of the means\r\nof agricultural improvement; here, in addition to the riches of the\r\nsurface, my descendants may hope to derive the means of wealth from\r\nmineral riches beneath.” And this oversight has arisen chiefly from\r\nthe value of such knowledge not being understood—often from the very\r\nnature of it being unknown, even to otherwise well instructed practical\r\nmen. It is not to men well skilled merely in the details of local\r\nfarming, and who are therefore deservedly considered as authorities\r\nand good teachers in regard to local or district practice, that we are\r\nto look for an exposition, often not even for a correct appreciation,\r\nof those general principles on which a universal system of agriculture\r\nmust be based—without which principles, indeed, it must ever remain\r\na mere collection of empirical rules, to be studied and laboriously\r\nmastered in every new district we go to—as the traveller in foreign\r\nlands must acquire a new language every successive frontier he passes.\r\nEngland, the mistress of so many wide and unpeopled lands, over which\r\nthe dwellings of her adventurous sons are hereafter to be scattered, on\r\nwhich their toil is to be expended, and the glory of their motherland\r\nby their exertions to be perpetuated—England should especially\r\nencourage all such learning, and the sons of English farmers willingly\r\navail themselves of every opportunity of acquiring it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—OF GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS, AND THE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THE\r\nSOILS THAT REST UPON THEM.\r\n\r\nThe thousands of beds or strata of which I have spoken as lying one\r\nover the other in the crust of the globe, have, partly for convenience,\r\nand partly in consequence of certain remarkably distinctive characters\r\nobserved among them, been separated by geologists into three great\r\ndivisions—the _primary_, which are the lowest and the oldest; the\r\n_secondary_, which lie over them; and the _tertiary_, which are\r\nuppermost, and have been most recently formed. The strata, in these\r\nseveral divisions, have again been subdivided into groups, called\r\n_formations_. The following table exhibits the names and thicknesses\r\nof these formations, and the mineralogical characters of the rocks of\r\nwhich they severally consist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. TERTIARY STRATA.\r\n\r\n1. The _London and Plastic clays_, 500 to 900 feet thick, consist of\r\nstiff, almost impervious, dark-coloured clays,—chiefly in pasture.\r\nThe lower beds are mixed with sand, and produce an arable soil, but\r\nextensive heaths and wastes rest upon them in Berkshire, Hampshire, and\r\nDorset.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SECONDARY STRATA.\r\n\r\n2. _The Chalk_, about 600 feet in thickness, consists in the upper part\r\n(see diagram, No. 3, p. 88) of a purer chalk with layers of flint; in\r\nthe lower, of a marly chalk without flints. The soil of the upper chalk\r\nis chiefly in sheep-walks, that of the lower chalk is very productive\r\nof corn.\r\n\r\n3. The _Green Sand_, 500 feet thick, consists of 150 feet of clay, with\r\nabout 100 feet of sand above, and 250 feet below it. The upper sand\r\nforms a very productive arable soil, and the clay impervious, wet and\r\ncold lands chiefly in pasture. The lower sand is generally unproductive.\r\n\r\nIt is an important agricultural remark, that where the clay (plastic\r\nclay) comes in contact with the top of the chalk, an improved soil is\r\nproduced, and that where the chalk and the green sand mix, extremely\r\nfertile patches of country present themselves. (See pages 86 and 87.)\r\n\r\n4. The _Wealden formation_, nearly 1000 feet thick, consists of 400\r\nfeet of sand, covered by 300 of clay, and resting upon 250 of marls and\r\nlimestones. The clay forms the poor wet pastures of Sussex and Kent. On\r\nthe sands below the clay rest heaths and brushwood; but where the marls\r\nand limestones come to the surface, the land is of better quality, and\r\nis susceptible of profitable arable culture.\r\n\r\n5. In the _Upper Oolite_, of 600 feet in thickness, we have a bed of\r\nclay (Kimmeridge clay) 500 feet thick, covered by 100 feet of sandy\r\nlimestones. The clay lands are difficult and expensive to work, and are\r\nchiefly in old pasture. The sandy limestone soils above the clay are\r\nalso poor, but where they rest immediately upon, and are intermixed\r\nwith the clay, excellent arable land is produced.\r\n\r\n6. The _Middle Oolite_ of 500 feet consists also of a clay (Oxford\r\nclay) dark-blue, adhesive, and nearly 1000 feet thick, covered by 100\r\nfeet of limestones and sandstones. These latter produce good arable\r\nland where the lime happens to abound; the clays form close heavy\r\ncompact soils, most difficult and expensive to work. The extensive\r\npasture lands of Bedford, Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Wilts,\r\nOxford, and Gloucester, rest chiefly upon this clay, as do also the\r\nfenny tracts of Lincoln and Cambridge.\r\n\r\n7. The _Lower or Bath Oolite_, of 500 feet in thickness, consists of\r\nmany beds of limestone and sandstone, with about 200 feet of clay in\r\nthe centre of the formation. The soils are very various in quality,\r\naccording as the sandstone or limestone predominates. The clays are\r\nchiefly in pasture,—the rest is more or less productive, easily worked,\r\narable land. In Gloucester, Northampton, Oxford, the east of Leicester,\r\nand in Yorkshire, this formation is found to lie immediately beneath\r\nthe surface, and a little patch of it occurs also on the south-eastern\r\ncoast of Sutherland.\r\n\r\n6. The _Lias_ is an immense deposit of blue clay from 500 to 1000 feet\r\nin thickness, which produces cold, blue, unproductive, clay soils. It\r\nforms a long stripe of land from the mouth of the Tees, in Yorkshire,\r\nto Lyme Regis in Dorset. It is chiefly in old, and often very valuable\r\npasture.\r\n\r\n9. The _New Red Sandstone_, though only 500 feet in thickness, forms\r\nthe surface of nearly the whole central plain of England, and stretches\r\nnorth through Cheshire to Carlisle and Dumfries. It consists of red\r\nsandstones and marls,—the soils on which are easily and cheaply worked,\r\nand form some of the richest and most productive arable lands in the\r\nisland. In whatever part of the world the red soils of this formation\r\nhave been met with, they have been found to possess in general the same\r\nagricultural capabilities.\r\n\r\n10. The _Magnesian Limestone_, from 100 to 500 feet in thickness, forms\r\na stripe of generally poor thin soil from Durham to Nottingham, capable\r\nof improvement as arable land by high farming, but bearing naturally a\r\npoor pasture, intermingled with sometimes magnificent furze.\r\n\r\n11. The _Coal Measures_, from 300 to 3000 feet thick, consist of\r\nbeds of sandstones and dark-blue shales (hard clays), intermingled\r\n(_interstratified_) with beds of coal. Where the sands come to the\r\nsurface, the soil is thin, poor, hungry, sometimes almost worthless.\r\nThe shales, on the other hand, produce stiff, wet, almost unmanageable\r\nclays;—not unworkable, yet expensive to work, and requiring draining,\r\nlime, skill, capital, and a zeal for improvement, to be applied to\r\nthem, before they can be made to yield the remunerating crops of corn\r\nthey are capable of producing.\r\n\r\n12. To the _Millstone Grits_ of 600 feet or upwards in thickness the\r\nsame remarks apply. They are often only a repetition of the sandstones\r\nand shales of the coal measures, forming in many cases soils still more\r\nworthless. When the sandstones prevail, large tracts lie naked, or\r\nbear a thin and stunted heath; where the shales abound, the naturally\r\ndifficult soils of the coal shales again recur. These rocks are\r\ngenerally found on the outskirts of our coal-fields.\r\n\r\n13. The _Mountain Limestone_, 800 to 1000 feet thick, is a hard blue\r\nlimestone rock, separated here and there into distinct beds by layers\r\nof sandstones, of sandy slates, or of blue shales like those of the\r\ncoal measures. The soil upon the limestone is generally thin, but\r\nproduces a naturally sweet herbage. When the limestone and clay (shale)\r\nadjoin each other, arable land occurs, which is naturally productive of\r\noats, yet, when the climate is favourable, capable of being converted\r\ninto good wheat land. In the north of England a considerable tract of\r\ncountry is covered by these rocks, but in Ireland they form nearly the\r\nwhole of the interior of the island.\r\n\r\n14. The _Old Red Sandstone_ varies in thickness from 500 to 10,000\r\nfeet. It possesses many of the valuable agricultural qualities of the\r\n_new red_, consisting, like it, of red sandstones and marls, which\r\ncrumble down into rich red soils. Such are the soils of Brecknock,\r\nHereford, and part of Monmouth; of part of Berwick and Roxburgh; of\r\nHaddington and Lanark; of southern Perth; of either shore of the\r\nMoray Firth; and of the county of Sutherland. In Ireland, also, these\r\nrocks abound in Tyrone, Fermanagh, and Monaghan; in Waterford, in\r\nMayo, and in Tipperary. In all these places, the soils they form are\r\ngenerally the best in their several neighbourhoods, though here and\r\nthere,—where the sandstones are harder, more siliceous and impervious\r\nto water,—tracts, sometimes extensive, of heath and bog occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—PRIMARY STRATA.\r\n\r\n15. _The Upper Silurian system_ is nearly 4000 feet in thickness, and\r\nforms the soils over the lower border counties of Wales. It consists\r\nof sandstones and shales, with occasional limestones; but the soils\r\nformed from these beds take their character from the general abundance\r\nof clay. They are cold, usually unmanageable, _muddy_ clays, with\r\nthe remarkably inferior agricultural value of which the traveller is\r\nimmediately struck, as he passes westward off the red sandstones of\r\nHereford on to the upper silurian rocks of Radnor.\r\n\r\n16. The _Lower Silurian_ rocks are also nearly 4000 feet in thickness,\r\nand in Wales lie to the west of the upper silurian rocks. They consist\r\nof about 2500 feet of sandstone, on which, when the surface is not\r\nnaked, barren heaths alone rest.\r\n\r\nBeneath these sandstones lie 1200 feet of sandy and earthy limestones,\r\nfrom the decay of which, as may be seen on the southern edge of\r\nCaermarthen, fertile arable lands are produced.\r\n\r\n17. The _Cambrian System_, of many thousand yards in thickness,\r\nconsists in great part of clay slates, more or less hard, which often\r\nweather slowly, and almost always produce either poor and thin soils,\r\nor cold, difficultly manageable clays, expensive to work, and requiring\r\n_high farming_ to bring them into profitable arable cultivation.\r\nCornwall, western Wales, and the mountains of Cumberland, in England;\r\nthe high country which stretches from the Lammermuir hills to\r\nPortpatrick, in Scotland; the mountains of Tipperary, and a large tract\r\non the extreme south of Ireland,—on its east coast, and far inland\r\nfrom the bay of Dundalk,—are covered by these slate rocks. Patches of\r\nrich, well cultivated land occur here and there on this formation, with\r\nmuch also that is improvable; but the greater part of it is usurped by\r\nworthless heath and extensive bogs.\r\n\r\n18. The _Mica Slate and Gneiss systems_ are of unknown thickness, and\r\nconsist chiefly of hard and slaty rocks, crumbling slowly, forming\r\npoor, thin soils, which rest on an impervious rock, and which, from\r\nthe height to which this formation generally rises, are rendered more\r\nunproductive by an unpropitious climate. They form extensive heathy\r\ntracts in Perth and Argyle, and on the north and west of Ireland. Here\r\nand there only, in the valleys or sheltered slopes, and by the margins\r\nof the lakes, spots of bright green meet the eye, and patches of a\r\nwilling soil, fertile in corn.\r\n\r\nA careful perusal of the preceding sketch of the general agricultural\r\ncapabilities of the soils formed from the several classes of\r\nstratified rocks, will have presented to the reader many illustrations\r\nof the facts stated in the preceding section; he will have drawn\r\nfor himself—to specify a few examples—the following among other\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n1. That some formations, like the new red sandstone, yield a soil\r\nalmost always productive; others, as the coal measures and millstone\r\ngrits, a soil almost always _naturally_ unproductive.\r\n\r\n2. That good, or better land at least, than generally prevails in a\r\ndistrict, may be expected where two formations or two different kinds\r\nof rock meet,—as when a limestone and a clay mingle their mutual ruins\r\nfor the formation of a common soil.\r\n\r\n3. That in almost every country extensive tracts of land on certain\r\nformations will be found laid down to natural grass, _in consequence of\r\nthe original difficulty and expense of working_. Such are the Lias, the\r\nOxford, the Kimmeridge, and the London clays. In raising corn, it is\r\nnatural that the lands which are easiest and cheapest worked should be\r\nfirst subjected to the plough; it is not till implements are improved,\r\nskill increased, capital accumulated, and population presses, that the\r\nheavier lands will be rescued from perennial grass, and made to produce\r\nthat greatly increased amount of food for both man and beast, which\r\nthey are easily capable of yielding.\r\n\r\nThe turnip soils of Great Britain are in many districts, it may be,\r\nbut indifferently farmed; and the state has reason to complain of\r\nmuch individual neglect of known and certain methods of increasing\r\ntheir productiveness; but the next _great_ achievement which British\r\nagriculture has to effect, is to subdue the stubborn clays, and to\r\nconvert them into what many of them are yet destined to become, the\r\nrichest corn-bearing lands in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Soils of the Granitic and Trap Rocks.—Accumulations\r\n        of transported Sands, Gravels, and Clays.—Use\r\n        of Geological Maps in reference to Agriculture.\r\n        —Physical characters and Chemical constitution\r\n        of Soils.—Relation between the nature of the Soil\r\n        and the kind of Plants that naturally grow upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was stated, in the preceding lecture, (see p. 82,) that rocks are\r\ndivided by geologists into the stratified and the _unstratified_.[14]\r\nThe stratified rocks cover by far the largest portion of the globe, and\r\nthus form a variety of soils, of which a general description has just\r\nbeen given. The unstratified rocks are of two kinds—the _granites_\r\nand the _trap_ rocks; and as a considerable portion of the area of our\r\nisland is covered by them, it will be proper shortly to consider the\r\npeculiar characters of each, and the differences of the soils produced\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n[14] The unstratified are often called _crystalline_ rocks, because\r\nthey frequently have a glassy appearance, or contain regular crystals\r\nof certain mineral substances; often also _igneous_ rocks, because they\r\nappear all to have been originally in a melted state, or to have been\r\nproduced by fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—SOILS OF THE GRANITES AND TRAP ROCKS.\r\n\r\n1. The _granites_ consist of a mixture, in different proportions, of\r\nthree minerals, known by the names of _quartz_, _felspar_, and _mica_.\r\nThe latter, however, is generally present in such small quantity, that\r\nin our general description it may be safely left out of view. Granites,\r\ntherefore, consist chiefly of quartz and felspar, in proportions which\r\nvary very much, but the former, on an average, constitutes perhaps from\r\none-third to one-half of the whole.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_ has already been described—(see p. 51)—as the substance of\r\nflint, the silica of the chemist. When the granite decays, this portion\r\nof it forms a more or less coarse siliceous sand.\r\n\r\n_Felspar_ is a white, greenish, or flesh-coloured mineral, often more\r\nor less earthy in its appearance, but generally hard and brittle, and\r\nsometimes glassy. It is scratched by, and thus is readily distinguished\r\nfrom, quartz. When it decays, it forms an exceedingly fine clay.\r\n\r\nA remarkable difference appears thus to exist, in chemical\r\nconstitution, between these two minerals—a difference which must affect\r\nalso the soils produced from them. A granite soil, in addition to the\r\nsiliceous sand, will consist chiefly of silica, alumina, and potash;\r\na hornblende soil, in addition to silica and alumina, of much lime,\r\nmagnesia, and oxide of iron—of nearly 2½ cwt. of each of these latter\r\nfor every ton of decayed rock. A hornblende soil, therefore, contains\r\nmore of those inorganic constituents which the plants require for their\r\nhealthy sustenance, and therefore will prove more generally productive\r\nthan a soil of decayed felspar. But when the two are mixed, as in the\r\ngreenstones, the soil must be still more favourable to vegetable life.\r\nThe potash and soda, of which the hornblende is nearly destitute, the\r\nfelspar is able abundantly to supply; while, by the hornblende are\r\nyielded lime and magnesia, which are known to exercise a remarkable\r\ninfluence on the progress of vegetation.\r\n\r\n2. The _trap_ rocks, comprising the greenstones and basalts, consist\r\nessentially[15] of felspar and _hornblende_ or _augite_. In contrasting\r\nthe trap rocks with the granites, it may be stated _generally_, that\r\nwhile the granites consist of felspar and _quartz_, the traps consist\r\nof felspar and hornblende (or augite). In the traps, both the felspar\r\nand the hornblende are reduced, by the action of the weather to a more\r\nor less fine powder, affording materials for a soil; in the granites\r\nthe felspar is the principal source of all the earthy matter they are\r\ncapable of yielding. If we compare together, therefore, the chemical\r\ncomposition of the two minerals (hornblende and felspar), we shall see\r\nin what respect these two varieties of soil ought to differ.

And such is actually\r\nthe result of observation and experience in every part of the globe.\r\nUnproductive granite soils cover nearly the whole of Scotland north\r\nof the Grampians, and large tracts of land in Devon and Cornwall, and\r\non the east and west of Ireland; while fertile trap soils extend over\r\nthousands of square miles in the lowlands of Scotland, and in the\r\nnorth of Ireland; and where in Cornwall they occasionally mix with\r\nthe granite soils, they are found to redeem them from their natural\r\nbarrenness.\r\n\r\nWhile such is the general rule in regard to these two classes of soils,\r\nit happens on some spots that the presence of other minerals in the\r\ngranites, or of hornblende or mica in larger quantity than usual, give\r\nrise to a granitic soil of average fertility, as is the case in the\r\nScilly isles; while, in like manner, the trap rocks are sometimes, as\r\nin parts of the isle of Skye, so peculiar in constitution as to condemn\r\nthe land to almost hopeless infertility.\r\n\r\nIn some districts the decayed traps are dug up, and applied with\r\nadvantage, as a top-dressing, to other kinds of land; and as by\r\nadmixture with the decayed trap, the granitic soils are known to be\r\nimproved in quality, so an admixture of decayed granite with many trap\r\nsoils, were it readily accessible, might add to their fertility also.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE SUPERFICIAL ACCUMULATIONS OF TRANSPORTED MATERIALS\r\nON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to guard the reader against disappointment, when he\r\nproceeds to examine the existing relation between the soils and the\r\nrocks on which they lie, or to infer the quality of the soil from the\r\nknown nature of the rock in conformity with what has been above laid\r\ndown,—by explaining another class of geological appearances which\r\npresent themselves not only in our own country but in almost every\r\nother part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe unlearned reader of the preceding section and chapter may say—I\r\nknow excellent land resting upon the granites, fine turnip soils on the\r\nOxford or London clays, tracts of fertile fields on the coal measures,\r\nand poor, gravelly farms on the boasted new red sandstone: I have no\r\nfaith in theory—I can have none in theories which are so obviously\r\ncontradicted by natural appearances. Such, it is to be feared, is\r\nthe hasty mode of reasoning among too many _locally_[16] excellent\r\npractical men, familiar, it may be, with many useful and important\r\nfacts, but untaught to look through and beyond isolated facts to the\r\nprinciples on which they depend.\r\n\r\n[16] By _locally_ excellent, I mean those who are the best possible\r\nfarmers of their own district and after their own way, but who would\r\nfail in other districts requiring other methods. To the possessor of\r\nagricultural principles the modifications required by difference of\r\ncrop, soil, and climate, readily suggest themselves, where the mere\r\npractical man is bewildered, disheartened, and in despair.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has lived long, on the more exposed shores of our island,\r\nhas seen, that when the weather is dry, and the sea winds blow strong,\r\nthe sands of the beach are carried inland and spread over the soil,\r\nsometimes to a considerable distance from the coast. In some countries\r\nthis sand-drift takes place to a very great extent, and gradually\r\nswallows up large tracts of fertile land.\r\n\r\nAgain, most people are familiar with the fact, that during periods of\r\nlong continued rain, when the rivers are flooded and overflow their\r\nbanks, they not unfrequently bear with them loads of sand and gravel,\r\nwhich they carry far and wide, and strew at intervals over the surface\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nSo the annual overflowings of the Nile, the Ganges, and the river of\r\nAmazons, gradually deposit accumulations of soil over surfaces of great\r\nextent;—and so also the bottoms of most lakes are covered with thick\r\nbeds of sand, gravel, and clay, which have been conveyed into them from\r\nthe higher grounds by the rivers through which they are fed.\r\n\r\nTo these and similar agencies, a large portion of the existing dry land\r\nof the globe has been, and is still exposed. Hence in many places,\r\nthe rocks, and the soils naturally derived from them, are buried\r\nbeneath accumulated heaps or layers of sand, gravel, and clay, which\r\nhave been brought from a greater or less distance, and which have\r\nnot unfrequently been derived from rocks of a totally different kind\r\nfrom those of the district in which they are now found. On these\r\naccumulations of transported materials, a soil is produced which often\r\nhas no relation in its characters to the rocks which cover the country,\r\nand the nature of which a familiar acquaintance with these rocks would\r\nnot enable us to predict.\r\n\r\nTo this cause is due that discordance between the first indications\r\nof geology, as to the origin of soils from the rocks on which they\r\nrest, and the actually observed character of those soils in certain\r\ndistricts—of which discordance mention has been made as likely to\r\nawaken doubt and distrust in the mind of the less instructed student in\r\nregard to the predictions of agricultural geology. There are several\r\ncircumstances, however, by which the careful observer is materially\r\naided in endeavouring to understand what the nature of the soils is\r\nlikely to be, and how they ought to be treated, even when the subjacent\r\nrocks are thus overlaid by masses of drifted materials. Thus—\r\n\r\n1. It not unfrequently happens, that the materials brought from a\r\ndistance are more or less mixed up with the fragments and decayed\r\nmatter of the rocks which are native to the spot, so that though\r\nmodified in quality, the soil, nevertheless, retains the general\r\ncharacters of that which is formed on other spots from the decay of\r\nthese rocks alone.\r\n\r\n2. Where the formation is extensive, or covers a large area, as the\r\nnew red sandstones and coal measures do in this country,—the mountain\r\nlimestones in Ireland, and the granites in the north of Scotland—the\r\ntransported sand, gravel, or clay, strewed over one part of the\r\nformation, has not unfrequently been derived from the rocks of another\r\npart of the _same_ formation, so that, after all, the soils may be said\r\nto be produced from the rocks on which they rest, and may be judged of\r\nfrom the known constitution of these rocks.\r\n\r\n3. Or if not from the rocks of the same formation, they have most\r\nfrequently been derived from those of a neighbouring formation—from\r\nrocks which are to be found at _no great distance_, and generally on\r\nhigher ground. Thus the ruins of the millstone grit rocks are often\r\nspread over the surface of the coal measures—of these, again, over the\r\nmagnesian limestone,—of the latter, over the new red sandstone, and so\r\non. The effect of this kind of transport upon the soils, is merely to\r\noverlap, as it were, the edges of one formation with the proper soils\r\nof the formations that adjoin it in the particular direction from which\r\nthe drifted materials are known to have come.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the occurrence on certain spots, or tracts\r\nof country, of soils that have no apparent relation to the rocks on\r\nwhich they immediately rest, tends in no way to throw doubt upon, to\r\ndiscredit or to disprove, the conclusions drawn from the more general\r\nfacts and principles of geology. It is still generally true that soils\r\n_are_ derived from the rocks on which they rest. The exceptions are\r\nlocal, and the difficulties which these local exceptions present,\r\nrequire only from the agricultural geologist a more careful study of\r\nthe structure of each district, before he pronounces a decided opinion\r\nas to the degree of fertility it either naturally possesses, or by\r\nskilful cultivation may be made to attain.\r\n\r\nGeological _maps_ point out with more or less precision the extent of\r\ncountry over which the chalk, the red sandstone, the granites, &c.,\r\nare found immediately beneath the loose materials on the surface; and\r\nthese maps are of great value in indicating also the general quality of\r\nthe soils over the same districts. It may be true, that here and there\r\nthe _natural_ soils are masked or buried by transported materials,\r\nyet the _political economist_ may, nevertheless, with safety estimate\r\nthe general agricultural capabilities and resources of a country by\r\nthe study of its geological structure—the _capitalist_ judge in what\r\npart of it he is likely to meet with an agreeable investment—and the\r\n_practical farmer_ in what country he may expect to find land that will\r\nbest reward his labours—that will admit of the kind of culture to which\r\nhe is most accustomed, or, by the application of better methods, will\r\nmanifest the greatest agricultural improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate on the fertility of a soil is often very\r\ngreat. This influence depends very much upon what are called the\r\n_physical_ properties of soils.\r\n\r\n1. Some soils are heavier and denser than others, sand and marls being\r\nthe heaviest, and peaty soils the lightest. In reclaiming peat lands,\r\nit is found to be highly beneficial to increase their density by a\r\ncovering of clay, sand, or limestone gravel.\r\n\r\n2. Again, some soils absorb the rains that fall, and retain them in\r\nlarger quantity and for a longer period than others. Strong clays\r\nabsorb and retain nearly three times as much water as sandy soils do,\r\nwhile peaty soils absorb a still larger proportion. Hence the more\r\nfrequent necessity for draining clayey than sandy soils; hence also the\r\nreason why, in peaty lands, the drains must be kept carefully open, in\r\norder that the access of springs and of other water from beneath, may\r\nbe as much as possible prevented.\r\n\r\n3. When dry weather comes, soils lose water by evaporation with\r\ndifferent degrees of rapidity. In this way a siliceous sand will give\r\noff the same weight of water in the form of vapour, in one-third of the\r\ntime necessary to evaporate it from a stiff clay, a peat, or a rich\r\ngarden mould, when all are equally exposed to the air. Hence the reason\r\nwhy plants are so soon burned up in a sandy soil. Not only do such\r\nsoils _retain_ less of the rain that falls, but that which is retained\r\nis also more speedily dissipated by evaporation. When rains abound,\r\nhowever, or in very moist seasons, these same properties of sandy soils\r\nenable them to sustain a luxuriant vegetation, when plants will perish\r\non clay lands from excess of moisture.\r\n\r\n4. In drying under the influence of the sun, soils contract and\r\ndiminish in bulk in proportion to the quantity of clay or of peaty\r\nmatter they contain. Sand does not at all diminish in bulk in drying,\r\nbut peat shrinks in one-fifth, and agricultural clay nearly as much.\r\nThe roots are thus compressed, and air is excluded, especially from\r\nthe hardened clays, and thus the plant is placed in a condition\r\nunfavourable to its growth. Hence the value of proper admixtures of\r\nsand and clay. By the latter (the clay), a sufficient quantity of\r\nmoisture is retained, and for a sufficient length of time; while, by\r\nthe former, the roots are preserved from compression, and a free access\r\nof air is permitted.\r\n\r\n5. In the hottest and most drying weather, the soil has seasons of\r\nrespite from the scorching influence of the sun. During the cooler\r\nseason of the night, even when no perceptible dew falls, it has the\r\npower of again extracting from the air a portion of the moisture it\r\nhad lost during the day. Perfectly pure sand possesses this power in\r\nthe least degree; it absorbs little or no moisture from the air. A\r\nstiff clay, on the other hand, will in a single night absorb sometimes\r\nas much as a 30th part of its own weight, and a dry peat as much as a\r\n12th of its weight; and, generally, the quantity thus drunk in by soils\r\nof various qualities, is dependent upon the proportions of clay and\r\nvegetable matter they severally contain. We cannot fail to perceive\r\nfrom these facts, how much of the productive capabilities of a soil\r\nis dependent upon the proportions in which its different earthy and\r\nvegetable constituents are mixed together.\r\n\r\n6. The temperature of a soil, or the degree of warmth it is capable\r\nof attaining under the influence of the sun’s rays, materially affects\r\nthe progress of vegetation. Every gardener knows how much _bottom_\r\nheat forces the growth, especially of young plants; and wherever a\r\nnatural warmth exists in the soil, independent of the sun, as in the\r\nneighbourhood of volcanoes, there it exhibits the most exuberant\r\nfertility. One main influence of the sun in spring and summer is\r\ndependent upon its power of thus warming the soil around the young\r\nroots, and thus rendering it propitious to their rapid growth. But the\r\nsun does not warm all soils alike: some become much hotter than others,\r\nthough exposed to the same sunshine. When the temperature of the air\r\nin the shade is no higher than 60° to 70°, a _dry_ soil may become so\r\nwarm as to raise the thermometer to 90° or 100°. Mrs. Ellis states,\r\nthat among the Pyrenees the rocks actually smoke after rain under the\r\ninfluence of the summer sun, and become so hot, that you cannot sit\r\ndown upon them. In _wet_ soils the temperature rises more slowly, and\r\nnever attains the same height as in a dry soil by 10° or 15°. Hence it\r\nis strictly correct to say, that wet soils are _cold_; and it is easy\r\nto understand how this coldness is removed by perfect drainage. Dry\r\nsands and clays, and blackish garden mould, become warmed to nearly\r\nan equal degree under the same sun; brownish red soils are heated\r\nsomewhat more, and dark-coloured peat the most of all. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that the presence of dark-coloured vegetable matter renders\r\nthe soil more absorbent of heat from the sun, while the colour of the\r\ndark-red marls of the new and old red sandstones may, in some degree,\r\naid the other causes of fertility in the soils which they produce.\r\n\r\nGranite generally forms hills and sometimes entire ridges of mountains.\r\nWhen it decays, the rains and streams wash out and carry down the fine\r\nfelspar clay, and leave the (quartz) sand on the sides of the hills.\r\nHence the soil in the bottoms and flats of granite countries consists\r\nof a cold, stiff, wet, more or less impervious clay, which often bears\r\nonly heath, bog, or a poor and unnutritive pasture. The hill sides are\r\neither bare or covered with a thin, sandy, and ungrateful soil, of\r\nwhich little can be made by the aid even of skill and industry. Yet\r\nthe opposite sides of the same mountains often present a remarkable\r\ndifference in this respect, those which are most beaten by the rains\r\nhaving the light clay most thoroughly washed from their surfaces, and\r\nbeing therefore the most barren.\r\n\r\nIn reading the above observations, the practical reader can hardly\r\nfail to have been struck with the remarkable similarity in physical\r\nproperties between stiff clay and peaty soils. Both retain much of the\r\nwater that falls in rain, and both part with it slowly by evaporation.\r\nBoth contract much in drying; and both absorb moisture readily from the\r\nair in the absence of the sun. In this similarity of properties, we\r\nsee not only why the first steps in improving both kinds of soil must\r\nbe very nearly the same; but why, also, a mixture either of clay or of\r\nvegetable matter will equally impart to a sandy soil many of those aids\r\nto, or elements of, fertility—of which they are alike possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—OF THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nSoils perform at least three functions, in reference to vegetation.\r\nThey serve as a basis in which plants may fix their roots and sustain\r\nthemselves in their erect position,—they supply inorganic food to\r\nvegetables at every period of their growth,—and they are the medium in\r\nwhich many chemical changes take place, that are essential to a right\r\npreparation of the various kinds of food which the soil is destined to\r\nyield to the growing plant.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of soils as consisting chiefly of sand, lime, and clay,\r\nwith certain saline and organic substances in smaller and variable\r\nproportions. But the study of the ash of plants (see chap. iv.) shews\r\nus, that a fertile soil must of necessity contain an appreciable\r\nquantity of at least eleven different substances, which in most cases\r\nexist in greater or less relative abundance in the ash both of wild and\r\nof cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nTwo well known geological facts lead to precisely the same conclusion.\r\nWe have seen that the soils formed from the unstratified rocks,—the\r\ngranites and the traps,—while they each contain certain earthy\r\nsubstances in proportions peculiar to themselves, yet contain also in\r\ngeneral a _trace_ of most of those different kinds of matter which are\r\nfound in the ash of plants. And when to this fact is added the other,\r\nthat the stratified rocks appear to be only the long accumulating\r\nfragments and ruins of more ancient unstratified masses—which, under\r\nvarious agencies, have gradually crumbled to dust, been strewed over\r\nthe surface in alternate layers, and afterwards again consolidated,—the\r\nreader will readily grant, that in all rocks, and consequently in all\r\nsoils, _traces_ of every one of these substances may generally be\r\npresumed to exist.\r\n\r\nActual _chemical analysis_ confirms these deductions in regard\r\nto the constitution of soils. It shews that, in most soils, the\r\npresence of the several constituents of the ash of plants may be\r\ndetected, though in very variable proportions. And following up its\r\ninvestigations, in regard to the effect of this difference in the\r\nproportion of the generally less abundant constituents of the soil, it\r\nestablishes certain other points of the greatest possible importance to\r\nagricultural practice. Thus, it has found, for example,\r\n\r\n1. That as a proper adjustment of the proportions of clay and sand\r\nis necessary, in order that a soil may possess the most favourable\r\n_physical_ properties—so that the mere presence of the various kinds\r\nof inorganic food in a soil is not sufficient to make it productive\r\nof a given crop, but that they must be so adjusted in quantity that\r\nthe plant shall be able readily and at the proper time to obtain an\r\nadequate supply of each.\r\n\r\n2. That when a soil is particularly poor in certain of these\r\nsubstances, the valuable, cultivated corn crops, grasses, and trees,\r\nrefuse to grow upon them in a healthy manner, and to yield remunerating\r\nreturns. And,\r\n\r\n3. That when certain other substances are present in too great\r\nabundance, the soil is rendered equally unpropitious to the most\r\nimportant crops.\r\n\r\nIn these facts the intelligent reader will perceive the foundation of\r\nthe varied applications to the soil which are everywhere made under\r\nthe direction of a skilful practice, and of the difficulties which, in\r\nso many localities, lie in the way of bringing the land into such a\r\nstate as shall fit it readily to supply all the wants of those kinds of\r\nvegetables which it is the special object of artificial culture easily\r\nand abundantly to raise.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis is a difficult art,—one which demands much chemical\r\nknowledge, and skill in chemical practice (manipulation, as it is\r\ncalled), and calls for both time and perseverance—if valuable,\r\ntrustworthy, and _minutely correct_ results are to be obtained. I\r\nbelieve it is only by aiming after such minutely correct results that\r\nchemical analysis is likely to throw light on the peculiar properties\r\nof those soils which, while they possess much general similarity in\r\ncomposition and in physical properties, are yet found in practice to\r\npossess very different agricultural capabilities. Many such cases\r\noccur in every country, and they are the kind of difficulties in\r\nregard to which agriculture has a right to say to chemistry—“These are\r\nmatters which I hope and expect you will satisfactorily clear up.” But\r\nwhile agriculture has a right to use such language, she has herself\r\npreliminary duties to perform. She has no right in one breath to deny\r\nthe value of chemical theory to agricultural practice, and in another\r\nto ask the sacrifice of time and labour in doing her chemical work.\r\nChemistry is a wide field, and many zealous lives may be spent in the\r\nprosecution of it without at all entering upon the domain of practical\r\nagriculture. It may be that here and there it may fall in with the\r\nhumour or natural bias of some one chemist to apply his knowledge to\r\nthis most important art; but hitherto the appreciation of such efforts\r\nhas, in general, been so small—the reception of scientific results and\r\nsuggestions by the agricultural body so ungracious—that little wonder\r\ncan exist that so many have quitted the field in disgust—that the\r\nmajority of capable men should studiously avoid it.\r\n\r\nHence it has happened that, in England, the analysis of soils has\r\nrarely been undertaken, except as a matter of professional business,\r\nwhere so much time was, by a fair calculation, given for so much money,\r\nand an analysis made, of that degree of accuracy only which the time\r\nallotted to it permitted the analyst to attain.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to illustrate the deductions which, as above\r\nstated, may be drawn from an accurate chemical analysis, I shall\r\nexhibit the constitution of three different soils as determined\r\nby Sprengel, a German chemist, now at the head of the Prussian\r\nAgricultural school, and whose own taste, as well as his professional\r\nfunction, have long directed his attention, and with much success, to\r\nscientific agriculture.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is a very fertile alluvial soil from East Friesland, formerly\r\noverflowed by the sea, but for 60 years cultivated with corn and pulse\r\ncrops _without manure_.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is a fertile soil near Göttingen, which produces excellent crops\r\nof clover, pulse, rape, potatoes, and turnips, the two last more\r\nespecially _when manured with gypsum_.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is a very barren soil from Lunenburg.\r\n\r\nWhen washed with water in the manner described in pages 70 to 73, they\r\ngave, respectively, from 1000 parts of soil—\r\n\r\n                                            No. 1.

This soluble matter consisted of\r\ncommon salt, chloride of potassium, sulphate of potash and gypsum,\r\nwith a trace of sulphate of magnesia, sulphate of iron, and phosphate\r\nof soda. The presence of this comparatively large quantity of these\r\ndifferent saline substances,—originally derived, no doubt, in great\r\npart from the sea,—was probably one reason why it could be so long\r\ncropped without manure.\r\n\r\nThe unfruitful soil is much the lightest of the three, containing\r\n40 per cent. of sand; but this is not enough to account for its\r\nbarrenness—many light soils containing a larger proportion of sand, and\r\nyet being sufficiently fertile.\r\n\r\nThe finer portions separated from the sand, and soluble matter,\r\nconsisted in 1000 parts of\r\n\r\n                               No. 1.

The composition of No. 1 illustrates the first of those general\r\ndeductions above stated, that a considerable supply of _all_ the\r\nspecies of inorganic food is necessary to render a soil eminently\r\nfertile. Not only does this soil contain a comparatively large quantity\r\nof soluble saline matter, but it contains also nearly 10 per cent.\r\nof organic matter, and, what in connection with this is of great\r\nimportance, 6 per cent. of lime. The potash and soda, and the several\r\nacids, are also present in sufficient abundance.\r\n\r\n2. In the second,—a fertile soil, but one which _cannot dispense with\r\nmanure_,—there is little soluble saline matter, and in the insoluble\r\nportion we see that there are mere _traces_ of potash, soda, and the\r\nimportant acids. It contains also 5 per cent. only of organic matter,\r\nand about 2 per cent. of lime, which smaller proportions, together\r\nwith the deficiencies above stated, remove this soil from the most\r\n_naturally_ fertile class to that class which is susceptible, in\r\nhands of ordinary skill, of being _brought to_, and _kept in_, a very\r\nproductive condition.\r\n\r\n3. In the fine part of the third soil, we observe that there are many\r\nmore substances deficient than in No. 2. The organic matter amounts\r\napparently to 4 per cent., and there seems to be nearly half a per\r\ncent. of lime. But it will be recollected, that this soil contains 40\r\nper cent. of sand, so that in every hundred of soil there are only 60\r\nof the fine matter, of which the composition is presented in the table,\r\nor 100 lbs. of the native soil contain only 2½ lbs. of organic matter\r\nand ¼ lb. of lime.\r\n\r\nBut all these _wants_ would not condemn the soil to hopeless\r\nbarrenness, because in favourable circumstances, and where it was worth\r\nthe cost, they might all be supplied. But the oxide of iron amounts to\r\n8 per cent. of this fine matter, a proportion of this substance which,\r\nin a soil containing so little organic matter, appears, from practical\r\nexperience, to be incompatible with the healthy growth of cultivated\r\ncrops. To this soil, therefore, there requires to be added not only\r\nthose substances of which it is destitute, but such other substances\r\nalso as shall prevent the injurious effect of the large proportion of\r\noxide of iron.\r\n\r\nIn these three soils, then, we have examples, _first_, of one which\r\ncontains within itself all the elements of fertility; _second_, of a\r\nsoil which is destitute, or nearly so, of certain substances,—which,\r\nhowever, can be readily added by the ordinary manures in general\r\nuse,—and to which the elements of gypsum are especially useful, in\r\naiding it to feed the potato and the turnip; and, _third_, of a soil\r\nnot only poor in many of the necessary species of the inorganic food\r\nof plants, but too rich in one which, when present in excess, is\r\nprejudicial to vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThis illustration, therefore, will aid the general reader in\r\ncomprehending how far rigid chemical analysis is fitted to throw light\r\nupon the capabilities of soils, and to _direct_ agricultural practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.—OF THE RELATION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE CHARACTER OF THE\r\nSOIL AND THE KIND OF PLANTS THAT GROW UPON IT.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this study of the chemical constitution of soils\r\nwill, perhaps, be most readily appreciated by a glance at the very\r\ndifferent kinds of vegetables which, under the same circumstances,\r\ndifferent soils naturally produce.\r\n\r\nThere are none so little skilled in regard to the capabilities of the\r\nsoil, as not to be aware that some lands naturally produce abundant\r\nherbage or rich crops, while others refuse to yield a nourishing\r\npasture, and are deaf to the often repeated solicitations of the\r\ndiligent husbandman. There exists, therefore, a universally understood\r\nconnection between the kind of soil and the kind of plants that\r\nnaturally grow upon it. It is interesting to observe how close this\r\nrelation in many cases is.\r\n\r\n1. The sands of the sea-shore, and the margins of salt-lakes, are\r\ndistinguished by their peculiar tribes of salt-loving plants;—the\r\ndrifted sands more remote from the beach produce their own long waving\r\ncoarser grass,—while further inland again, other vegetable races appear.\r\n\r\n2. Peaty soils laid down to grass, or existing as natural meadows,\r\nproduce one woolly soft grass almost exclusively (the _Holcus\r\nlanatus_); when limed, again, these same soils become propitious to\r\ngreen crops and produce much straw, but refuse to fill the ear.\r\n\r\n3. On the margins of water-courses, in which silica abounds, the\r\nmare’s-tail (_Equisetum_) springs up in abundance; while, if the stream\r\ncontain much carbonate of lime, the water-cress appears and lines its\r\nsides, and the bottom of its shallow bed, sometimes for many miles from\r\nits source.\r\n\r\n4. The Cornish heath (_Erica vagans_) shews itself only above the\r\nserpentine rocks; the red clover and the vetch delight in the presence\r\nof gypsum; and white clover, of alkaline matter in the soil.\r\n\r\n5. Then, again, plants seem to alternate with each other on the same\r\nsoil. Burn down a forest of pines in Sweden, and one of birch takes\r\nits place _for a while_. The pines after a time again spring up and\r\nultimately supersede the birch. The same takes place naturally. On the\r\nshores of the Rhine are seen ancient forests of oak from two to four\r\ncenturies old,—gradually giving place to a natural growth of beech; and\r\nothers where the pine is succeeding to both. In the Palatinate, the\r\nancient oak woods are followed by natural pines; and in the Jura, the\r\nTyrol, and Bohemia, the pine alternates with the beech.\r\n\r\nThese and other similar differences depend upon the chemical\r\nconstitution of the soil. The slug may live well, and therefore infest\r\na field almost deficient in lime; the common land snail will abound at\r\nthe roots of the hedges only where lime is plentiful, and can easily\r\nbe obtained for the construction of its shell. So it is with plants.\r\nEach grows spontaneously where its wants can be most fully and most\r\neasily supplied. If they cannot move from place to place like the\r\nliving animal, yet their seeds can lie dormant, until either the hand\r\nof man or the operation of natural causes produces such a change in the\r\nconstitution of the soil as to fit it for ministering to their most\r\nimportant wants.\r\n\r\nAnd such changes do naturally come over the soil. The oak, after\r\nthriving for long generations on a particular spot, gradually sickens;\r\nits entire race dies out,—and other races succeed it. The operation\r\nof natural causes has gradually removed from the soil that which\r\nfavoured the oak, and has introduced or given the predominance to those\r\nsubstances which favour the beech or the pine.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of the farmer the land grows sick of this crop,—it becomes\r\ntired of that. These facts are generally indications of a change in\r\nthe chemical constitution of the soil. This alteration may proceed\r\nslowly and for many years, and the same crops may still grow upon it\r\nfor a succession of rotations. At length the change is too great for\r\nthe plant to bear; it sickens, yields an unhealthy crop, and becomes\r\nultimately extinct.\r\n\r\nThe plants we raise for food have similar likes and dislikes with those\r\nthat are naturally produced. On some kinds of food they thrive,—fed\r\nwith others, they sicken or die. The soil must therefore be prepared\r\nfor their special growth.\r\n\r\nIn an artificial rotation of crops, we only follow nature. One crop\r\nextracts from the soil a certain quantity of all the inorganic\r\nconstituents of plants; but some of these in much larger proportions\r\nthan others. A second crop carries off in preference a larger quantity\r\nof those substances which the former had left; and thus it is clearly\r\nseen, both why an abundant manuring may so alter the constitution of\r\nthe soil, as to enable it to grow almost any crop; and why, at the same\r\ntime, this soil may in succession yield more abundant crops and in\r\ngreater number, if the kinds of plant sown and reaped be so varied as\r\nto extract from the soil, one after the other, the several different\r\nsubstances which the manure we have originally added is known to\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nThe management and tilling of the soil, in fact, is a branch of\r\npractical chemistry, which, like the art of dyeing or of lead smelting,\r\nmay advance to a certain degree of perfection, without the aid of pure\r\nscience; but which can only have its processes explained, and be led on\r\nto shorter,—more simple,—more economical,—and more perfect processes,\r\nby the aid of scientific principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of the Improvement of the Soil—Mechanical and Chemical\r\n        Methods—Draining—Subsoiling—Ploughing, and Mixing\r\n        of Soils—Use of Lime, Marl, and Shell-sand—Manures\r\n        —Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral Manures.\r\n\r\nThe soil is possessed of certain existing and obvious qualities, and\r\nof certain other dormant capabilities; how are these qualities to be\r\nimproved,—these dormant capabilities to be awakened?\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct methods by which these ends may be, in some\r\nmeasure, attained,—by the use of _mechanical_, and by the application\r\nof _chemical_, means. Mechanical operations produce changes _chiefly_\r\nin the physical properties of the soil,—chemical means alter its\r\nelementary constitution. Ploughing, draining, mixing, &c. belong to\r\nthe former class of operations; manuring and irrigation belong to the\r\nlatter. It will be proper to consider these methods separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF MECHANICAL METHODS OF IMPROVING THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n1. _Draining._—The first step to be taken, in order to increase the\r\nfertility of nearly all the improveable lands of Great Britain, is\r\nto drain them. So long as they remain wet, they will continue to be\r\ncold. The heat of the sun’s rays, which is intended by nature to warm\r\nthe soil, will be expended in evaporating the water from its surface;\r\nand thus the plants will never receive that genial warmth about their\r\nroots which so much favours their rapid growth. Where too much water\r\nis present in the soil also, that food of the plant which the soil\r\nsupplies is so much diluted, that either a much greater quantity of\r\nfluid must be taken in by the roots,—much more work done,—or the plant\r\nwill be scantily nourished. The presence of so much water in the stem\r\nand leaf keeps down _their_ temperature likewise, when the sunshine\r\nappears; an increased evaporation takes place from their surfaces, a\r\nlower natural heat, in consequence, prevails in the interior of the\r\nplant, and the chemical changes on which its growth depends proceed\r\nwith less rapidity.\r\n\r\nBy the removal of the water, the physical properties of the soil also\r\nare in a remarkable degree improved. Dry pipe-clay can be easily\r\nreduced to a fine powder, but it naturally, and of its own accord,\r\nruns together when water is poured upon it. So it is with clays in\r\nthe field. The soil expands, becomes close and adhesive, and excludes\r\nthe air from the roots of the growing plant,—the access of which air\r\nappears to be almost an essential element in the healthy growth of the\r\nmost important vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nOpen an outlet for the water below, and as it trickles away, the air\r\nfrom above will follow it and take its place among the pores of the\r\nsoil, carrying to every root the salutary influences it is appointed\r\nto bear with it wherever it penetrates. When freed from water also,\r\nthe stiff soil becomes more mellow; and when once stirred up to a\r\nconsiderable depth, more universally porous,—so that air can make\r\nits way everywhere, and the roots can find their easy way in every\r\ndirection. The presence of vegetable matter,—whether existing naturally\r\nin a soil thus physically altered, or artificially added to it,—becomes\r\nof double value. When drenched with water, this vegetable matter\r\neither decomposes very slowly, or produces acid compounds more or less\r\nunwholesome to the plant, and even exerts injurious chemical reactions\r\nupon the earthy and saline constituents of the soil. In the presence\r\nof air, on the contrary, this vegetable matter decomposes rapidly,\r\nproduces carbonic acid in large quantity, as well as other compounds\r\nfit for food, and even renders the inorganic constituents of the soil\r\nmore fitted to enter the roots, and thus to supply more rapidly what\r\nthe several parts of the plant require.\r\n\r\nNor is it only stiff and clayey soils to which draining can with\r\nadvantage be applied. It will be obvious to every one, that when\r\nsprings rise to the surface in sandy soils, a drain must be made to\r\ncarry off the water,—it will also readily occur, that where a sandy\r\nsoil rests upon a hard or clayey bottom, drains may also be necessary;\r\nbut it is not unfrequently supposed, that when the subsoil is sand or\r\ngravel, that drains can only in special cases be necessary.\r\n\r\nEvery one, however, is familiar with the fact, that when water is\r\napplied to the bottom of a flower-pot full of soil, it will gradually\r\nfind its way to the surface, however light the soil may be. So it is\r\nin sandy soils or subsoils in the open field. If water abound at the\r\ndepth of a few feet, or if it so abound at certain seasons of the year,\r\n_that_ water will rise to the surface; and as the sun’s heat dries it\r\noff by evaporation, more water will follow to supply its place. This\r\nattraction from beneath will always go on when the air is dry and warm,\r\nand thus a double evil will ensue—the soil will be kept moist and cold,\r\nand instead of a constant circulation of air downwards, there will be a\r\nconstant current of water upwards. Thus will the roots, the under soil,\r\nand the organic matter it contains, be all deprived of the benefits\r\nwhich the access of the air is fitted to confer. The remedy for these\r\nevils is to be found in an efficient system of drainage.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I shall add one important practical remark, which will\r\nreadily suggest itself to the geologist who has studied the action of\r\nair and water on the various clay beds that occur here and there as\r\nmembers of the series of stratified rocks. _There are no clays which do\r\nnot gradually soften under the united influence of air and of running\r\nwater. It is false economy, therefore, to lay down tiles without\r\nsoles_—however hard and stiff the clay subsoil may appear to be. In\r\nthe course of ten or fifteen years the stiffest clays will soften, so\r\nas to allow the tile to sink; and many very much sooner. The passage\r\nfor the water is thus gradually narrowed; and when the tile has sunk a\r\ncouple of inches, the whole must be taken up. Thousands of miles of\r\ndrains have been thus laid down, both in the low country of Scotland\r\nand in the southern counties of England, which have now become nearly\r\nuseless; and yet the system still goes on. It would appear even as if\r\nthe farmers and proprietors of each district—unwilling to believe in or\r\nto be benefitted by the experience of others—were determined to prove\r\nthe matter in their own case also, before they will consent to adopt\r\nthat surer system which, though demanding a slightly greater outlay\r\nat first, will return upon the drainer with no after-calls for either\r\ntime or capital. If my reader live in a district where this practice\r\nis now exploded, and if he be inclined to doubt if other counties be\r\nfarther behind the advance of knowledge than his own, I would invite\r\nhim to spend a week in crossing the county of Durham, where he may find\r\nopportunities not only of satisfying his own doubts, but of scattering\r\nhere and there a few words of useful advice among the more intelligent\r\nof our practical farmers.\r\n\r\n2. _Subsoiling._—The subsoil plough is an auxiliary to the drain.\r\nThough there are few subsoils through which the water will not at\r\nlength make its way, yet there are some so stiff either naturally\r\nor from long consolidation, that the good effect of a well-arranged\r\nline of drains is lessened by the slowness with which they allow the\r\nsuperfluous rains to pass through them. In such cases, the use of the\r\nsubsoil plough is most advantageous in loosening the under layers of\r\nclay, and allowing the water to find a ready escape downwards and to\r\neither side until it reach the drains.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that if a piece of stiff clay be cut into the shape of\r\na brick, and then allowed to dry, it will contract and harden—it will\r\nform an air-dried brick, almost impervious to any kind of gas—wet it\r\nagain, it will swell and become still more impervious. Cut up _while\r\nwet_, it will only be divided into so many pieces, each of which will\r\nharden when dry, or the whole of which will again attach themselves\r\nand stick together if exposed to pressure. But tear it asunder _when\r\ndry_, and it will fall into many pieces, will more or less crumble, and\r\nwill readily admit the air into its inner parts. So it is with a clay\r\nsubsoil.\r\n\r\nAfter the land is provided with drains, the subsoil being very\r\nretentive, the subsoil plough is used to open it up—to let out the\r\nwater and to let in the air. If this is not done, the stiff under-clay\r\nwill contract and bake as it dries, but it will neither sufficiently\r\nadmit the air nor open a free passage for the roots. But let this\r\noperation be performed when the clay is still too wet, a good effect\r\nwill follow, in the first instance; but after a while, the cut clay\r\nwill again cohere, and the former will pronounce subsoiling to be a\r\nuseless expense _on his land_. Defer the use of the subsoil plough till\r\nthe clay is dry—it will then _tear_ and _break_ instead of _cutting_,\r\nand its openness will remain. Once give the air free access, and it,\r\nafter a time, so modifies the drained clay, that it no longer has an\r\nequal tendency to cohere.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith of Deanston very judiciously recommends that the subsoil\r\nplough should never be used till at least a year after the land has\r\nbeen thoroughly drained. This in many cases will be a sufficient\r\nsafeguard—will allow a sufficient time for the clay to dry; in other\r\ncases two years may not be too much. But this precaution has by some\r\nbeen neglected, and subsoiling being with them a failure, they have\r\nsought, in some supposed chemical or other quality _of their soil_,\r\nfor the cause of a want of success which is to be found in their own\r\nneglect of a most necessary precaution. Let not the practical man be\r\ntoo _hasty_ in desiring to attain those benefits which attend the\r\nadoption of improved modes of culture; let him give every method a fair\r\ntrial; _and above all, let him make his trial in the way and with\r\nthe precautions recommended by the author of the method_, before he\r\npronounce its condemnation.\r\n\r\n3. _Deep-ploughing_, like subsoiling, aids the effect of the drains,\r\nand so far, and where it goes nearly as deep, more completely effects\r\nthe same object. But independent of this, it has other uses and merits,\r\nand where it has been successfully applied, has improved the land by\r\nthe operation of other causes.\r\n\r\nSubsoiling only lets out the water, and allows access to the air and a\r\nfree passage to the roots. Deep-ploughing, in addition to these, brings\r\nnew earth to the surface, forms thus a deeper soil, and more or less\r\nalters both its physical qualities and its chemical constitution.\r\n\r\nIf the plough be made to bring up two inches of clay or sand, it will\r\nstiffen or loosen the soil, as the case may be, or it may affect its\r\ncolour or density. It is clear and simple enough, therefore, that by\r\ndeep-ploughing the physical properties of the soil may be altered.\r\n\r\nBut there are certain substances contained in every soil, whether\r\nin pasture or under the plough, which gradually make their way down\r\ntowards the subsoil. They sink till they reach at last that point\r\nbeyond which the plough does not usually penetrate. Every farmer knows\r\nthat lime thus sinks. In peat-soils top-dressed with clay, the clay\r\nthus sinks. In sandy soils also which have been clayed, the clay sinks;\r\nand in all these cases, I believe, the sinking takes place more rapidly\r\nwhen the land is laid down to grass. Where soils are marled, the marl\r\nsinks; and the rains, in like manner, gradually wash out that which\r\ngives their fertilizing virtue to the under chalk-soils (see page 88),\r\nand render necessary a new application from beneath, to renovate its\r\nproductive powers.\r\n\r\nIf this be the case with earthy substances such as those now mentioned,\r\nwhich are insoluble in water, it will be readily believed that those\r\nsaline ingredients of the soil which are readily soluble will be still\r\nsooner washed out of the upper and conveyed to the under soil. Thus\r\nthe subsoil may gradually become rich in those substances of which the\r\nsurface-soil has been robbed. Bring up a portion of this subsoil by\r\ndeep-ploughing, and you restore to the land a portion of what it has\r\nlost—substances, perhaps, which may render it much more fruitful than\r\nbefore. Such is an outline of the theory of deep-ploughing, and it is\r\nentirely unexceptionable.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the land to have originally contained something noxious\r\nto vegetation, which in process of time has been washed down into the\r\nsubsoil, then to bring this again to the surface would be materially\r\nto injure the land. This also is true, and a sound discretion must no\r\ndoubt be employed, in judging when and where such evil effects are\r\nlikely to follow.\r\n\r\nSuch cases, however, are more rare than many suppose. There are few\r\nsubsoils which a full and fair exposure to a winter’s frost will not in\r\na great degree deprive of all their noxious qualities, and render fit\r\nto ameliorate the general surface of the poorer lands. If the reader\r\ndoubt this fact, let him visit Yester, and give a calm consideration to\r\nthe efforts produced by the use of deep-ploughing on the home-farm of\r\nthe Marquis of Tweeddale.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the farmer fears, as he does in the county of Durham, to\r\nbring up a single inch of the yellow clay that lies beneath his soil.\r\nIn the first inch lodges, among other substances, the iron worn from\r\nhis plough, which in some soils, and after a lapse of years, amounts to\r\na considerable quantity. Till it is exposed to the air, this iron is\r\nhurtful to vegetation, and one of the benefits of a winter’s exposure\r\nof such subsoils to the air, is the effect produced upon the iron it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nIt is the want of drainage, however, and of the free access of\r\nair, that most frequently renders subsoils for a time injurious to\r\nvegetation. Let the lands be well drained—let the subsoils be washed\r\nfor a few years by the rain-water passing through them,—and there are\r\nfew of those which are clayey in their nature that may not ultimately\r\nbe brought to the surface, not only with safety, but with advantage to\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n4. _Ploughing._—Other benefits, again, attend upon the ordinary\r\nploughings, hoeings, and workings of the land. Its parts are more\r\nminutely divided—the air gets access to every particle—it is rendered\r\nlighter, more open, more permeable to the roots. The vegetable matter\r\nit contains decomposes more rapidly by a constant turning of the soil,\r\nso that wherever the fibres of the roots penetrate, they find organic\r\nfood provided for them, and an abundant supply of the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere to aid in preparing it. The production of ammonia and of\r\nnitric acid also (see pages 33 to 36), and the absorption of one or\r\nboth from the air, take place to a greater extent, the finer the soil\r\nis pulverised, and the more it has been exposed to the action of the\r\natmosphere. The general advantage, indeed, to be derived from the\r\nconstant working of the soil, may be inferred from the fact, that Tull\r\nreaped twelve successive crops of wheat from the same land by the\r\nrepeated use of the plough and the horse-hoe. There are few soils so\r\nstubborn as not to shew themselves grateful in proportion to the amount\r\nof this kind of labour that may be bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\n5. _Mixing._—It has been shewn (page 114), that the physical properties\r\nof the soil have an important influence upon its average fertility. The\r\nadmixture of pure sand with clay soils produces an alteration which is\r\noften beneficial, and which is wholly physical. The sand merely opens\r\nthe pores of the clay, and makes it more permeable to the air.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of clay with sandy or peaty soils, however, produces both\r\na physical and a chemical alteration. The clay not only consolidates\r\nand gives body to the sand or peat, but it also mixes with them certain\r\nearthy and saline substances useful or necessary to the plant, which\r\nneither the sand nor peat might originally contain in sufficient\r\nabundance. It thus alters its chemical constitution, and fits it for\r\nnourishing new races of plants.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case also with admixtures of marl, of shell-sand, and of\r\nlime. They slightly consolidate the sands and open the clays, and\r\nthus improve the mechanical texture of both kinds of soil, but their\r\nmain operation is chemical; and the almost universal benefit they\r\nproduce depends upon the new chemical element they introduce into the\r\nconstitution of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of almost universal remark, that in our climate soils\r\nare fertile—clayey or loamy soils, that is—only when they contain an\r\nappreciable quantity of lime. In whatever way it acts, therefore, the\r\nmixing of lime in any of the forms above mentioned, with a soil in\r\nwhich little or no lime exists, is one of the surest practical methods\r\nof bringing it nearer in composition to those soils from which the\r\nlargest returns of agriculture produce are usually obtained. Some of\r\nthe chemical effects of the lime upon the soil will be explained in a\r\nsubsequent section. (See page 195.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF THE CHEMICAL METHOD OF IMPROVING THE SOIL BY THE USE OF\r\nMANURES.\r\n\r\nNone of the above methods of improving the soil are mechanical\r\nonly—they all involve some chemical alterations also, which are readily\r\nto be explained by a knowledge of elementary chemical principles.\r\nBut the manuring of the land is more strictly a chemical operation,\r\nand may therefore with propriety be separated from those methods of\r\nimproving its quality which involve at the same time important and\r\nexpensive mechanical operations.\r\n\r\nIn commencing the tillage of a piece of land, the conscientious farmer\r\nmay have three objects in view in regard to it.\r\n\r\n1. He may wish to reclaim a waste, or to restore a neglected farm to an\r\naverage condition of fertility.\r\n\r\n2. Finding the land in this average state, his utmost ambition may be\r\nto keep it in its present condition; or,\r\n\r\n3. By _high_ farming he may wish to develope all its capabilities,\r\nand to increase its permanent productiveness in the greatest possible\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe man who aims at the last of these objects is not only the best\r\ntenant and the best citizen, but he is also his own best friend. The\r\nhighest farming, skilfully and prudently conducted, is also the most\r\nremunerating.\r\n\r\nBut whichever of these three ends he aims at, he will be unable to\r\nattain it without a due knowledge of the various manures it may be in\r\nhis power to apply to his land—what these manures are, or of what they\r\nconsist—the general and special purposes they are each intended to\r\nserve—which are the most effective for this or that crop—how they are\r\nto be obtained in the greatest abundance, and at the least cost—how\r\ntheir strength may be economized,—and in what state and at what seasons\r\nthey may be most beneficially applied to the land. Such are a few of\r\nthe questions which the skilful farmer should be ready to ask himself,\r\nand should be able to answer.\r\n\r\nBy a _manure_ is to be understood whatever is capable of feeding or of\r\nsupplying food to the plant. And us plants require earthy and saline\r\nas well as vegetable food, gypsum and nitrate of soda are as properly\r\ncalled manures as farm-yard dung, bone-dust, or night-soil.\r\n\r\nManures naturally divide themselves into such as are of _vegetable_, of\r\n_animal_, and of _mineral_ origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OF VEGETABLE MANURES.\r\n\r\nThere are two purposes which vegetable manure is generally supposed to\r\nserve when added to the soil. It loosens the land, opens its pores,\r\nand makes it lighter; and it also serves to supply organic food to the\r\nroots of the growing plant. It serves, however, a third purpose: it\r\nyields to the roots those saline and earthy matters which it is their\r\nduty to find in the soil, and which exist in decaying plants in a state\r\nmore peculiarly fitted to enter readily into the circulating system of\r\nnew races.\r\n\r\nDecayed vegetable matters, therefore, are in reality mixed manures,\r\nand their value in enriching the land must vary considerably with the\r\n_kind_ of plants and with the _parts_ of those plants of which they\r\nare chiefly made up. This depends upon the remarkable difference which\r\nexists in the _quantity_ and _kind_ of inorganic matter present in\r\ndifferent vegetable substances, as indicated by the ash they leave (see\r\npages 52 to 62). Thus if 1000 lbs. of the saw-dust of the willow be\r\nfermented, and added to the soil, they will enrich it by the addition\r\nof only 4½ lb. of saline and earthy matter, while 1000 lbs. of the\r\ndry leaves of the same tree fermented, and laid on, will add 82 lbs.\r\nof inorganic matter. Thus, independent of the effect of the vegetable\r\nmatter in each, the one will produce a very much greater effect upon\r\nthe soil than the other.[17]\r\n\r\n[17] It is owing to this large quantity of saline and other inorganic\r\nmatter that fermented leaves form too strong a dressing for flower\r\nborders, and that gardeners therefore generally mix them up into a\r\ncompost.\r\n\r\nThere are three states in which vegetable matter is collected by the\r\nhusbandman for the purpose of being applied to the land—the _green_\r\nstate; the _dry_ state; and that state of imperfect decay in which it\r\nforms _peat_.\r\n\r\n1. _Green Manuring._—When grass is mown in the field, and laid in\r\nheaps, it speedily heats, ferments, and rots. But, if turned over\r\nfrequently and dried into hay, it may be kept for a great length of\r\ntime without undergoing any material alteration. The same is true of\r\nall other vegetable substances—they all rot more readily in the green\r\nstate. The reason of this is, that the sap or juice of the green plant\r\nbegins very soon to ferment in the interior of the stem and leaves,\r\nand speedily communicates the same condition to the moist fibre of\r\nthe plant itself. When once it has been dried, the vegetable matter\r\nof the sap loses this easy tendency to decay, and thus admits of long\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThe same rapid decay of green vegetable matter takes place when it is\r\nburied in the soil. Thus the cleanings and scourings of the ditches and\r\nhedge-sides form a compost of mixed earth and fresh vegetable matter,\r\nwhich soon becomes capable of enriching the ground. When a green crop\r\nis ploughed into a field, the whole of its surface is converted into\r\nsuch a compost—the vegetable matter in a short time decays into a\r\nlight, black mould, and enriches in a remarkable degree and fertilizes\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nHence the practice of green manuring has been in use from very early\r\nperiods. The second or third crop of _lucerne_ was ploughed in by the\r\nancient Romans—as it still is by the modern Italians. In Tuscany, the\r\n_white lupin_ is ploughed in, in preference—in Germany, _borage_.\r\nIn French Flanders, two crops of _clover_ are cut, and the third is\r\nploughed in. In Sussex, _turnip_ seed has been sown at the end of\r\nharvest, and after two months again ploughed in, with great benefit to\r\nthe land. Turnip leaves and potato tops decay more readily, and more\r\nperfectly, and are more enriching when buried in the green state. It is\r\na prudent economy, therefore, where circumstances admit of it, to bury\r\nthe potato tops on the spot from which the potatoes are raised. Since\r\nthe time of the Romans, it has been the custom to bury the cuttings\r\nof the vine stocks at the roots of the vines themselves; and many\r\nvineyards flourish for a succession of years without any other manuring.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat, winter tares, clover, and rape, are all occasionally sown\r\nfor the purpose of being ploughed in. This should be done _when the\r\nflower has just begun to open_, and if possible at a season when the\r\nwarmth of the air and the dryness of the soil are such as to facilitate\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThat the soil should become richer in vegetable matter by this burial\r\nof a crop than it was before the seed of that crop was sown, and should\r\nalso be otherwise benefitted, will be understood by recollecting (see\r\npage 42) that perhaps three-fourths of the whole organic matter we bury\r\nhas been derived from the air—that by this process of ploughing in,\r\nthe vegetable matter is more equally diffused through the whole soil\r\nthan it could ever be by any merely mechanical means;—and that by the\r\nnatural decay of this vegetable matter, ammonia and nitric acid are,\r\nto a greater extent (pages 33 and 34), produced in the soil, and its\r\nagricultural capabilities in consequence materially increased.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, while they explain the effect and illustrate\r\nthe value of green manuring, will also satisfy the intelligent\r\nagriculturist that there are methods of improving his land without\r\nthe aid either of town or of foreign manures—and that he overlooks\r\nan important natural means of wealth who neglects the green sods\r\nand crops of weeds that flourish by his hedgerows and ditches. Left\r\nto themselves, they ripen their seeds and sow them annually in his\r\nfields—collected in compost heaps they would materially add to his\r\nyearly crops of corn.\r\n\r\n_Sea-weeds._—Among green manures, the use of fresh sea-ware deserves\r\nespecial mention, from the remarkably fertilizing properties it is\r\nknown to possess, as well as from the great extent to which it is\r\nemployed on all our coasts. The produce of the isle of Thanet in Kent\r\nis said to have been doubled or tripled by the use of this manure; the\r\nfarms on the Lothian coasts are said to be let for 20s. or 30s. more\r\nrent when they have a right of way to the sea, where the weed is thrown\r\non shore; and in the Western Isles the sea-ware, the shell-marl, and\r\nthe peat-ash, are the three great natural fertilizers to which the\r\nagriculture of the district is indebted for the comparative prosperity\r\nto which it has in some of the islands already attained.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds decompose with great ease when collected in heaps or spread\r\nupon the land. During their decay, they yield not only organic food to\r\nthe plant but saline matters also, to which much of their efficacy both\r\non the grass and the corn crops is no doubt to be ascribed.\r\n\r\n2. _Manuring with dry Vegetable Matter._—Almost every one knows that\r\nthe saw-dust of most common woods decays very slowly—so slowly, that\r\nit is rare to meet with a practical farmer who considers it worth the\r\ntrouble of mixing with his composts. This property of slow decay is\r\npossessed in a certain degree by all _dry_ vegetable matter. Heaps\r\nof dry straw alone, or even mixed with earth, will ferment with\r\ncomparative difficulty and with great slowness. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, to mix it, as is usually done, with some substance that\r\nferments more readily, and which will impart its own condition to the\r\nstraw. Animal matters of any kind, such as the urine and droppings of\r\ncattle, are of this character; and it is by admixture with these that\r\nthe straw which is trodden down in the farm-yard is made to undergo a\r\nmore or less rapid fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe object of this fermentation is twofold—first, to reduce the\r\nparticles of the straw to such a minute state of division, that they\r\nmay admit of being diffused through the soil; and, second, that the dry\r\nvegetable matter may be so changed by exposure to the air, and other\r\nagencies, as to be fitted to yield both organic and inorganic food to\r\nthe roots of the plants it is intended to nourish.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this decomposition takes place very speedily, and of\r\nits own accord, when the vegetable matter is green, but that it can\r\nbe _induced_ or brought on in the case of dry straw by the agency\r\nof animal matter. The same means will cause the fermentation of any\r\nother vegetable substance which is in a minute state of division.\r\nEven saw-dust made into a compost heap with soil or sods, and watered\r\nregularly and copiously with the liquid manure of the farm-yards, may\r\nbe thus converted into a fertilizing vegetable mould.\r\n\r\nDifferences of opinion have prevailed, and discussions have taken\r\nplace, as to the relative efficacy of long and short—or of half\r\nfermented and of fully rotten dung. But if it be added _solely_ for the\r\npurpose of yielding food to the plant, or of preparing food for it, the\r\ncase is very simple. The more complete the state of fermentation—if not\r\ncarried too far—the more immediate will be the agency of the manure;\r\nhence the propriety of the application of short dung to turnips and\r\nother plants it is desirable to bring rapidly forward; but if the\r\nmanure be only half decayed, it will require time in the soil to\r\ncomplete the decomposition, so that its action will be more gradual and\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\nThough in the latter case the immediate action is not so perceptible,\r\nyet the ultimate benefit to the soil, and to the crops, may be even\r\ngreater, supposing them to be such as require no special forcing\r\nat one period of the year. With a view to this slow amelioration,\r\nvegetable matter of any kind may be added with benefit, if in a\r\nsufficient state of division, to the soil. Even saw-dust applied\r\nlargely to the land, has been found to improve it, though little at\r\nfirst, yet more during the second year after it was applied, still more\r\nduring the third, and most of all in the fourth season after it was\r\nmixed with the soil. That any dry vegetable matter, therefore, does not\r\nproduce an immediate effect, ought not to induce the practical farmer\r\nto despise the application to his land—either alone, or in the form\r\nof a compost—of every thing of the kind he can readily obtain. If his\r\nfields are not already very rich in vegetable matter, both he and they\r\nare likely to be ultimately benefitted by such additions to the soil.\r\n\r\n_Rape Dust._—It is from the straw of the corn-bearing plants, or from\r\nthe stems and leaves of the grasses, that the largest portion of the\r\nstrictly vegetable manures applied to the soil is generally obtained\r\nor prepared. But the seeds of all plants are much more enriching\r\nthan the substance of their leaves and stems. These seeds, however,\r\nare in general too valuable for food to admit of their application\r\nas a manure. Still the refuse of some, as that of different kinds\r\nof rape-seed after the oil is expressed, and which is unpalatable to\r\ncattle, is applied with great benefit to the land. Drilled in with\r\nspring wheat, or scattered as a top-dressing in spring at the rate of 5\r\ncwt. to an acre, it gives a largely increased and remunerating return.\r\nIt is applied with equal success to the cultivation of potatoes, and\r\ngenerally it may be substituted for farm-yard manure at the rate of\r\nabout 1 cwt. of rape dust for each ton of manure.\r\n\r\n_Malt Dust_ consists of the dried sprouts of barley, which, when the\r\nsprouted seed is dried in the process of malting, break off and form\r\na coarse powder. This is found to be almost equal to rape dust in\r\nfertilizing power.\r\n\r\n_Charcoal Powder_ possesses the remarkable property of absorbing\r\nnoxious vapours from the air and soil, and unpleasant impurities from\r\nwater. It also sucks into its pores much oxygen from the air. Owing\r\nto these and other properties, it is a valuable substance for mixing\r\nwith liquid manure, night-soil, farm-yard manure, ammoniacal liquor, or\r\nother rich applications to the soil. It is even capable by itself of\r\nyielding slow supplies of nourishment to living plants, and is said, in\r\nmany cases, without any admixture, to have been used with advantage in\r\npractical agriculture. In moist charcoal the seeds of the gardener are\r\nfound to sprout with remarkable quickness and certainty.\r\n\r\n_Soot_, whether from the burning of wood or of coal, is of vegetable\r\norigin, and consists chiefly of a finely-divided charcoal, possessing\r\nthe properties above mentioned. It contains, however, ammonia and\r\ncertain other substances in small quantity, to which its well known,\r\nand especially its _immediate_, effects upon vegetation are in part to\r\nbe ascribed.\r\n\r\n3. _The use of Peat._—In many parts of the world, and in none more\r\nabundantly, perhaps, than in Gt. Britain, is vegetable matter collected\r\nin the form of peat. This ought to supply an inexhaustible store of\r\norganic matter for the amelioration of the adjacent soils. We know that\r\nby draining off the sour and unwholesome water, and afterwards applying\r\nlime and clay, the surface of peat bogs may be gradually converted into\r\nrich corn-bearing lands. It must, therefore, be possible to convert\r\npeat itself by a similar process into a compost fitted to improve the\r\ncondition of other soils.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Meadowbank, who made many important experiments on\r\nthis subject, found, that after being partially dried by exposure to\r\nthe air, peat might be readily fermented, and brought into the state\r\nof a rich fertilizing compost by the same means which are adopted\r\nin the ordinary fermenting of straw. He mixed with it a portion of\r\nanimal matter, which soon communicated its own fermenting quality to\r\nthe surrounding peat, and brought it readily in to a proper heat. He\r\nfound that one ton of hot fermenting manure, mixed in alternate layers\r\nwith two of half dry peat, and covered by the same, was sufficient to\r\nferment the whole; and subsequently that the vapours which rise from\r\nnaturally fermenting farm-yard manure or animal matters, would alone\r\nproduce the same effect upon peat, placed so as readily to receive and\r\nabsorb them.\r\n\r\nAs ammonia is one of the compounds specially given off by putrifying\r\nanimal substances, it is not unlikely that a watering with _ammoniacal\r\nliquor_ would materially prepare the peat for undergoing fermentation.\r\nAt all events it seems possible to prepare any quantity of valuable\r\npeat compost by mixing the peat with a still less quantity of fermented\r\nmanure than was employed by Lord Meadowbank, provided the liquid manure\r\nof the farm-yard be collected in a cistern, and be thrown at intervals\r\nby means of a pump over the prepared heaps.\r\n\r\nOne important use also to which I think peat may be applied is, after\r\nit is partly dried, to build it into covered heaps, and half burn or\r\nchar it till it become readily reducible into a fine powder. In this\r\nstate it would be of great value as a mixture to preserve the virtues\r\nof liquid manures of all kinds, of night-soil, and of ammoniacal liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—RELATIVE VALUE OF DIFFERENT VEGETABLE MANURES.\r\n\r\nThere are two principles on which the relative value of different\r\nvegetable substances, as manures, may be stated to depend—_first_, on\r\nthe relative quantity and kind of _inorganic matter_ they contain; and\r\n_second_, on the relative proportions of _nitrogen_ present in each.\r\n\r\n1. Valued according to the _quantity_ of inorganic matter they\r\ncontain—the worth of the several kinds of straw and hay would be\r\nrepresented by the following numbers:—\r\n\r\n    Wheat straw,       70 to 360\r\n    Oat straw,        100 to 180\r\n    Hay,              100 to 200\r\n    Barley straw,     100 to 120\r\n    Pea straw,        100\r\n    Bean straw,        60 to  80\r\n    Rye straw,         50 to  70\r\n    Dry potato tops,  100\r\n    Dry turnip tops,  260\r\n    Rape, cake,              120\r\n\r\nthat is, a _ton weight_ of each of these substances, when made into\r\nmanure—provided nothing is washed out by the rains—will return to the\r\nsoil the above quantities of inorganic matter _in pounds_. Generally,\r\nperhaps, these numbers will give the reader an idea of the relative\r\n_permanent_ effect of these different kinds of vegetable matter when\r\nlaid upon the soil. But, by a reference to the facts stated in pp. 58\r\nto 64, in regard to the _quality_ of the inorganic matter contained in\r\nplants, he will satisfy himself, that the effect of these manures on\r\nparticular crops is not to be judged of solely by the absolute quantity\r\nof earthy and saline matter they contain;—that which the turnip-top,\r\nfor example, or the bean-stalk, returns to the soil, may not be exactly\r\nwhat will best promote the growth of wheat.\r\n\r\n2. On the other hand, if the fertilizing value of vegetable substances\r\nis to be calculated by the relative quantities of nitrogen they\r\nseverally contain, we should place them in the following order:—the\r\nnumber opposite to each substance representing that weight of it in\r\npounds, which would produce the same effect as 100 pounds of farm-yard\r\nmanure, consisting of the mixed droppings and litter of cattle.\r\n\r\n                         Equivalent\r\n                         quantities\r\n                         in pounds.\r\n    Farm-yard manure,       100\r\n    Wheat straw,             80 to 170\r\n    Oat straw,              150\r\n    Barley straw,           180\r\n    Buckwheat,               85\r\n    Pea straw,               45\r\n    Wheat chaff,             50\r\n    Green grass,             80\r\n    Potato tops,             75\r\n    Fresh sea-weed,          80\r\n    Rape dust,                8\r\n    Fir saw-dust,           250\r\n    Oak saw-dust,           180\r\n    Coal soot,               30\r\n\r\nThis table again presents the same substances in a somewhat different\r\norder of value; shewing, for example, not only that such substances\r\nas rape dust and soot should produce a much more remarkable effect\r\nupon vegetation, than the same weight even of farm-yard manure, but\r\nalso that certain dry vegetables, such as chaff and pea straw, will\r\nyield, when not unduly fermented, a more enriching manure than barley,\r\noat, or wheat straw. It agrees, also, with the known effect of green\r\nmanuring upon the land, since 80 pounds of meadow-grass ploughed in,\r\nwill be equal in virtue to 100 of farm-yard manure.\r\n\r\nSome writers ascribe the _entire_ action of these measures to the\r\nnitrogen they contain. This, however, is taking a one-side view of\r\ntheir real natural operation. The nitrogen, during their decay, is\r\nliberated chiefly in the form of ammonia—an evanescent substance,\r\nproducing an immediate effect in hastening or carrying further forward\r\nthe growth of the plant, but not remaining permanently in the soil. The\r\nreader, therefore, will form an opinion consistent alike with theory\r\nand with practice, if he conclude—\r\n\r\n1. That the _immediate_ effect of a vegetable manure, in hastening the\r\ngrowth of plants, is dependent, in a great degree, upon the quantity of\r\nnitrogen it contains and gives off during its decay in the soil.\r\n\r\n2. That the _permanent_ effect and value of manures is to be estimated\r\nchiefly by the quantity and quality of the inorganic matter they\r\ncontain—of the ash they leave when burned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the nitrogen may be nearly expended in a single\r\nseason—that of the earthy and saline matter may not be exhausted for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nNor is the carbon of vegetable substances without its important uses\r\nto vegetation. From the statements contained in the earlier chapters\r\nof the present work, it may be inferred that, however much influence\r\nwe may allow to the nitrogen and to the earthy matter of plants in\r\naiding the growth of future races—the soundest view of these important\r\nnatural operations is that which considers each element present in\r\ndecaying plants to be capable of ministering food to such as are still\r\nalive,—though we may not be able as yet, either to estimate the precise\r\nimportance of each element to any particular kind of crop, or exactly\r\nto adjust their relative quantities in our manures, so as to promote\r\nthe growth of such a crop in the greatest possible degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Animal Manures—Their relative value and mode of\r\n        Action—Difference between Animal and Vegetable\r\n        Manures—Cause of this difference—Mineral Manures\r\n        —Nitrates of Potash and Soda—Sulphate of Soda,\r\n        Gypsum, Chalk, and Quicklime—Chemical action of\r\n        these Manures—Artificial Manures—Burning and\r\n        Irrigation of the Soil—Planting and laying down\r\n        to grass.\r\n\r\nThe animal substances employed as manure consist chiefly of the flesh,\r\nblood, bones, horns, and hair of animals, of fish—which in some places\r\nare found in sufficient quantity to be laid upon the land—and of the\r\nsolid and liquid excrements of animals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF UNDIGESTED ANIMAL MANURES.\r\n\r\nAnimal substances, in general, act more powerfully as manures than\r\nvegetable substances—it is only the seeds of plants which can at all\r\ncompare with them in efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe _flesh_ of animals is rarely used as a manure, except in the case\r\nof dead horses, or cattle which cannot be used for food. Fish is\r\nchiefly applied in the form of the refuse of the herring and pilchard\r\nfisheries, though occasionally such shoals of sprats, herrings, and\r\neven mackerel, have been caught on our shores, as to make it necessary\r\nto employ them as manure. These recent animal substances are found to\r\nbe too _strong_ when applied directly to the land; they are generally,\r\ntherefore, made into a compost, with a large quantity of soil. Five\r\nbarrels of fish, or fish refuse, made into twenty loads of compost,\r\nwill be sufficient for an acre. The refuse of fish oils,—of the fat of\r\nanimals that has been melted for the extraction of the tallow—of skins\r\nthat have been boiled for the manufacture of glue—horns, hair, wool\r\n(woollen rags), and all similar substances, when made into composts,\r\nexercise, in proportion to their weight, a much greater influence upon\r\nvegetation than any of the more abundant forms of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nEven the bodies of insects are in many parts of the world important\r\nmanures of the soil. In warm climates, a handful of soil sometimes\r\nseems almost half made up of the wings and skeletons of dead\r\ninsects—the peasant in Hungary and Carinthia occasionally collects as\r\nmany as thirty cart-loads of dead marsh flies in a single year;—and in\r\nthe richer soils of France and England, where worms and other insects\r\nabound, the presence of their remains in the soil must also aid its\r\nnatural productiveness.\r\n\r\n_Blood_ is rarely applied to the land directly—though, like the other\r\nparts of animals, it makes an excellent compost. As it comes from\r\nthe sugar refineries, however, in which, with lime water and animal\r\ncharcoal, it is employed for the refining of sugar, it has obtained\r\na very extensive employment, especially in the south of France. This\r\nanimal black, or _animalized charcoal_, as it is sometimes called,\r\ncontains about twenty per cent. of blood, and has risen to such a price\r\nin France, that the sugar refiners actually sell it for more than the\r\nunmixed blood and animal charcoal originally cost them. This has given\r\nrise to the manufacture of artificial mixtures of charcoal, fecal\r\nmatters, and blood, which are also sold under the name of animalized\r\ncharcoal. The only disadvantage attending these artificial preparations\r\nis, that they are liable to be adulterated, or, for cheapness, prepared\r\nin a less efficient manner.\r\n\r\n_Horn_, _hair_, and _wool_, depend for their efficacy precisely on the\r\nsame principles as the blood and flesh of animals. They differ chiefly\r\nin this, that they are _dry_, while blood and flesh contain 80 to 90\r\nper cent. of their weight of water. Hence, a ton of horn shavings, of\r\nhair, or of dry woollen rags, ought to enrich the soil as much as ten\r\ntons of blood. In consequence, however, of their dryness, the horn and\r\nwool decompose much more slowly than the blood. Hence, the effect of\r\nsoft animal matters is more immediate and apparent, that of hard and\r\ndry substances less visible, but continuing for a much longer period of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Bones_, again, while they resemble horn in being dry, differ from it\r\nin containing, besides the animal matter, a large quantity of earthy\r\nmatter also, and hence they introduce a new agent to aid their effect\r\nupon the soil. Thus, the bones of the cow consist of 100 lbs. of\r\n\r\n    Phosphate of lime,                    55½\r\n    Phosphate of magnesia,                 3\r\n    Soda and common salt,                  3½\r\n    Carbonate of lime,                     3¾\r\n    Fluoride of calcium,                   1\r\n    Gelatine (the substance of _horn_),   33¼\r\n                                         -------\r\n                                          100\r\n\r\nWhile 100 lbs. of bone-dust, therefore, add to the soil as much\r\n_organic_ animal matter as 33 lbs. of horn, or as 300 or 400 lbs.\r\nof blood or flesh, they add, at the same time, much _inorganic_\r\nmatter—lime, magnesia, soda, common salt, and phosphoric acid (in\r\nthe phosphates),—all of which, as we have seen, must be present in a\r\nfertile soil, since the plants require a certain supply of them all\r\nat every period of their growth. These substances, like the inorganic\r\nmatter of plants, may remain in the soil, and may exert a beneficial\r\naction upon vegetation after all the organic or gelatinous matter has\r\ndecayed and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrom what is above stated, therefore, the reader will gather these\r\ngeneral conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. That animal substances which, like flesh and blood, contain much\r\nwater, decay rapidly, and are fitted to operate _immediately_ and\r\npowerfully upon vegetation, but are only temporary or evanescent in\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\n2. That when dry, as in horn, hair, and wool, they decompose, and\r\nconsequently act more slowly, and continue to manifest an influence, it\r\nmay be, for several seasons.\r\n\r\n3. That bones, acting like horn, in so far as their animal matter\r\nis concerned, and, like it, for a number of seasons, more or less,\r\naccording as they have been more or less finely crushed—may ameliorate\r\nthe soil by their earthy matter for a still longer period—permanently\r\nimproving the condition and adding to the natural capabilities of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—OF DIGESTED ANIMAL MANURES.\r\n\r\nPractical men have long been of opinion that the digestion of food,\r\neither animal or vegetable,—the passing of it through the bodies of\r\nanimals,—enriches its fertilizing power, weight for weight, when\r\nadded to the land. Hence, in causing animals to eat up as much of the\r\nvegetable productions of the farm as possible, it is supposed that not\r\nonly is so much food saved, but that the value of the remainder in\r\nfertilizing the land is greatly increased. In a subsequent section we\r\nshall see how far theory serves to throw light upon these opinions.\r\n(See Section IV., p. 182 to 186.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LIQUID EXCRETIONS.\r\n\r\nThe digested animal substances usually employed as manures are, the\r\nurine of the cow and the sheep, the solid excrements of the horse, the\r\ncow, the sheep, and the pig, the droppings of pigeons and other birds,\r\nand night-soil. The liquid manures act chiefly through the saline\r\nsubstances they hold in solution, while the solid manures contain also\r\ninsoluble matters, which decay slowly in the soil, and there become\r\nuseful only after a time. The former, therefore, will influence\r\nvegetation more powerfully at first; the action of the latter will be\r\nless evident, but will continue to operate for a much longer period.\r\n\r\n_Urine._—Human urine consists, in 1000 parts, of\r\n\r\n    Water,                                                   932\r\n    _Urea_, and other organic matters containing nitrogen,    49\r\n    _Phosphates_ of ammonia, lime, soda, and magnesia,         6\r\n    _Sulphates_ of soda and ammonia,                           7\r\n    Sal ammoniac and common salt,                              6\r\n                                                            ----\r\n                                                            1000\r\n\r\nA thousand pounds of urine therefore contain 68 lbs. of dry fertilizing\r\nmatter of the richest quality, worth, _at the present rate of selling\r\nartificial manures in this country_, at least 20s. a cwt. As each\r\nperson voids almost 1000 lb. of urine in a year, the national waste\r\nincurred in this form amounts, at the above valuation, to 12s. a head.\r\nAnd if five tons of farm-yard manure per acre, added year by year, will\r\nkeep a farm in good heart, four cwt. of the solid matter of urine would\r\nprobably have an equal effect; or the urine alone discharged into the\r\nrivers by a population of 10,000 inhabitants would supply manure to a\r\nfarm of 1500 acres, yielding a return of 4500 quarters of corn or an\r\nequivalent produce of other crops.\r\n\r\nThe urine of the cow is said to contain less water than that of man,\r\nthough of course much must depend upon the kind of food with which it\r\nis fed. Reckoning, then, the large quantity of liquid manure that\r\nis yielded by the cow (2000 or 3000 gallons a year), we may safely\r\nestimate the solid matter given off by a healthy animal in this form in\r\ntwelve months at 1200 to 1500 pounds weight, worth, _if it were in the\r\ndry state_, from £10 to £12 sterling. In the _liquid_ state, the urine\r\nof one cow collected and preserved as it is in Flanders, is valued in\r\nthat country at about £2 a year. Any practical farmer may calculate for\r\nhimself, therefore, how much real wealth, taking it even at the Flemish\r\nvalue, is lost in his own farm-yard—how much of the natural means of\r\nreproductive industry passes into his drains or evaporates into the air.\r\n\r\nThis liquid manure is invaluable, when collected in tanks, for watering\r\nthe manure and compost heaps, and thus hastening their decomposition;\r\nbut great part of it may also be sprinkled directly upon the fields of\r\ngrass and upon the young corn, with the best effects. It must, however,\r\nbe permitted to stand till fermentation commences, and afterwards\r\ndiluted with a considerable quantity of water, before it will be in the\r\nbest condition for laying on the land.\r\n\r\n_Urate._—In order to obtain the virtues of animal urine in a\r\nconcentrated form, the custom has been adopted of mixing burnt gypsum\r\nwith it, in the proportion of 10 lbs. to every 7 gallons, allowing the\r\nmixture, occasionally stirred, to stand some time, pouring off the\r\nliquid, and drying and crushing the gypsum. This is sold by manure\r\nmanufacturers under the name of _urate_. It never can possess, however,\r\nthe virtues of the urine, since it does not contain the soluble saline\r\nsubstances, which the gypsum does not carry down with it. Except the\r\ngypsum, indeed, 100 lbs. of urate contain no greater weight of saline\r\nand organic matter than 10 gallons of urine. If it be true, then, as\r\nthe manufacturers state, that 3 or 4 cwt. of urate are sufficient\r\nmanure for an acre, the practical farmer will, I hope, draw the\r\nconclusion,—not that it is well worth his while to venture his money\r\nin trying a portion of it upon a piece of his land,—but that a far\r\nmore promising adventure will be to go to some expense in saving his\r\nown liquid manure, and, after mixing it with burned gypsum, to lay it\r\nabundantly upon all his fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SOLID EXCRETIONS.\r\n\r\n_Cow and Horse Dung._—So much of the saline, nutritive, and soluble\r\norganic matters from the cow pass off in the liquid form, that cow\r\ndung is correctly called cold, since it does not readily heat and run\r\ninto fermentation. Mixed with other manures, however, or well diffused\r\nthrough the soil, it aids materially in promoting vegetation. The horse\r\nbeing fed generally on less liquid food, and discharging less urine,\r\nyields a hotter and richer dung, which, however, answers best also when\r\nmixed with other varieties. The dung of the swine is soft and _cold_,\r\nlike that of the cow, containing, like it, at least 75 per cent. of\r\nwater. As this animal lives on more varied food than any other reared\r\nfor the use of man, the manure obtained from it is also very variable\r\nin quality. Applied alone, as a manure to roots, it is said to give\r\nthem an unpleasant taste, and even to injure the flavour of tobacco. It\r\nanswers best for hemp, and, it is said, also for hops; but, mixed with\r\nother manures, it may be applied to any crop.\r\n\r\n_Night-soil_ is probably the most valuable, and yet, in Europe at\r\nleast, the most disliked and neglected of all the solid animal manures.\r\nIt varies no doubt in richness with the food of the inhabitants of each\r\ndistrict,—chiefly with the quantity of animal food they consume,—but\r\nwhen dry, no other solid manure, weight for weight, can probably be\r\ncompared with it in general efficacy. It contains much soluble and\r\nsaline matter, and as it is made up from the constituents of the food\r\nwe eat, of course it contains most of those elementary substances\r\nwhich are necessary to the growth of the plants on which we principally\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to dry this manure also, so as to render it\r\nmore portable,—to destroy its unpleasant smell, so as to reconcile\r\npractical men to a more general use of it,—and by certain chemical\r\nadditions, to prevent the waste of ammonia and other volatile\r\nsubstances, which are apt to escape and be lost when this and other\r\npowerful animal manures begin to putrify through decay. In Paris,\r\nBerlin, and other large cities, the night-soil, dried first in the air\r\nwith or without a mixture of gypsum or lime, then upon drying plates,\r\nand finally in stoves, is sold under the name of _poudrette_, and is\r\nextensively exported in casks to various parts of the country. In\r\nLondon also it is dried with various mixtures, while in others of our\r\nlarge towns an _animalized charcoal_ is prepared by mixing and drying\r\nnight-soil with gypsum and ordinary wood charcoal in fine powder.\r\n\r\nThe half-burned peat above described (p. 80,) would answer well for\r\nsuch a purpose, while few simple and easily attainable substances would\r\nmake a better compost with night-soil, and more thoroughly preserve its\r\nvirtues, than half-dry peat or rich vegetable soil, mixed with more or\r\nless marl or gypsum. It is impossible to estimate the proportion of\r\nwaste which this valuable manure undergoes by being allowed to ferment,\r\nwithout mixture, in the open air.\r\n\r\n_Taffo._—In China it is kneaded into cakes with clay, which are dried\r\nin the air, and, under the name of taffo, form an important article of\r\nexport from all the large cities of the empire.\r\n\r\n_Pigeons’ Dung._—The dung of all birds is found to possess eminent\r\nfertilizing virtues. Some varieties are stronger than others, or more\r\nimmediate in their action, and all are improved for the use of the\r\nfarmer by being some time kept, either alone or in compost. In Flanders\r\nthe manure of one hundred pigeons is considered worth 20s. a year for\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n_Guano_ is the name given by the natives of Peru to the dung of\r\nsea-fowl, which in former periods used to be deposited in vast\r\nquantities on the rocky shores and isles of the Peruvian coast. The\r\nnumerous shipping of modern times has disturbed and driven away many of\r\nthe sea-fowl, so that comparatively little of their recent droppings\r\nis now preserved or collected. Ancient heaps of it, however, still\r\nexist in many places, more or less covered up with drifted sand, and\r\nalso more or less decomposed. These are now largely excavated for\r\nexportation, not only to different parts of the coast of Peru, as seems\r\nto have been the case from the most remote periods, but also to Europe,\r\nand especially to England. It is at present sold at 20s. a cwt. in this\r\ncountry, and is capable of entirely replacing farm-yard dung,—that is\r\nto say, turnips may be manured successfully with guano alone;—but it\r\nhas not yet been satisfactorily determined that the English farmer can\r\nafford to use it in this way to any extent, at the price now asked for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe dung of birds possesses the united virtues of both the liquid and\r\nsolid excretions of other animals. It contains every part of the food\r\nof the bird, with the exception of what is absolutely necessary for\r\nthe support and for the right discharge of the functions of its own\r\nbody. It is thus fitted, therefore, to return to the plant a greater\r\nnumber of those substances on which plants live, than either the solid\r\nor the fluid excrements of other animals; in other words, to be more\r\nnourishing to vegetable growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—OF THE RELATIVE GROWTH OF THE DIFFERENT ANIMAL MANURES.\r\n\r\nThe fertilizing power of animal manures, in general, is dependent,\r\nlike that of the soil itself, upon the happy admixture they contain\r\nof a great number, if not of all, those substances which are required\r\nby plants in the universal vegetation of the globe. Nothing they\r\ncontain, therefore, is without its share of influence upon their\r\ngeneral effects, yet the amount of nitrogen present in each affords the\r\nreadiest and most simple criterion by which their agricultural value,\r\ncompared with that of vegetable matters and with that of each other,\r\ncan be pretty nearly estimated.\r\n\r\nIn reference to their relative quantities of nitrogen, therefore, they\r\nhave been arranged in the following order, the number opposite to each\r\nrepresenting the weight in pounds which is equivalent to or would\r\nproduce the same sensible effect upon the soil as 100 lbs. of farm-yard\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n    Farm-yard manure,                  100\r\n    Solid excrements of the cow,       125\r\n      ”       ”        ”    horse,      73\r\n    Liquid    ”        ”    cow,        91\r\n      ”       ”        ”    horse,      16\r\n    Mixed     ”        ”    cow,        98\r\n      ”       ”        ”    horse,      54\r\n      ”       ”        ”    sheep,      36\r\n      ”       ”        ”    pig,        64\r\n    Dry flesh,                           3\r\n    Pigeons’ dung,                       5\r\n    Flemish liquid manure,             200\r\n    Liquid blood,                       15\r\n    Dry blood,                           4\r\n    Feathers,                            3\r\n    Cow hair,                            3\r\n    Horn shavings,                       3\r\n    Dry woollen rags,                    2½\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the numbers in this table do not err very widely\r\nfrom the true relative value of these different manures, in so far as\r\nthe _organic_ matter they severally contain is concerned. The reader\r\nwill bear in mind, however,\r\n\r\n1. That the most powerful substances in this table, woollen rags, for\r\nexample,—2½ lbs. of which are equal in virtue to 100 lbs. of farm-yard\r\nmanure,—may yet shew less immediate sensible effect upon the crop than\r\nan equal weight of sheep’s dung, or even of urine. Such dry substances\r\nare long in dissolving and decomposing, and continue to evolve\r\nfertilizing matter, after the softer and more fluid manures have spent\r\ntheir force. Thus, while farm-yard manure or rape dust will immediately\r\nhasten the growth of turnips, woollen rags will come into operation at\r\na later period, and prolong their growth into the autumn.\r\n\r\n2. That besides their general relative value, as represented in the\r\nabove table, each of these substances has a further special value not\r\nhere exhibited, dependent upon the kind and quantity of saline and\r\nother inorganic matter which they severally contain. Thus three of dry\r\nflesh are equal to five of pigeons’ dung, in so far as the _organic_\r\npart is concerned; but the latter contains also a considerable quantity\r\nof bone-earth and of saline matter scarcely present at all in the\r\nformer. Hence pigeons’ dung will benefit vegetation in circumstances\r\nwhere dry flesh would in some degree fail. So the liquid excretions\r\ncontain much important saline matter not present in the solid\r\nexcretions,—not present either in such substances as horn, wool, and\r\nhair,—and, therefore, each must be capable of exercising an influence\r\nupon vegetation peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nHence the practical farmer sees the reason why no one _simple_ manure\r\ncan long answer on the same land; and why in all ages and countries the\r\nhabit of employing _mixed_ manures and artificial composts has been\r\nuniversally diffused.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—NATURAL DISTINCTION OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND\r\nVEGETABLE MANURES, AND THE CAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENCE.\r\n\r\nIn what do animal manures differ from vegetable manures,—what is the\r\ncause of this difference,—how does the digestion of vegetable matter\r\nimprove its value as a manure?\r\n\r\n1. The characteristic distinction between animal and vegetable manures\r\nis this,—that the former contain a much larger proportion of nitrogen\r\nthan the latter. This will be seen at once, by comparing together\r\nthe tables given in the two preceding sections, in which the numbers\r\nrepresent the relative agricultural values of certain animal and\r\nvegetable substances compared with farm-yard manure. The lowest numbers\r\nrepresent the highest value, and the largest amount of nitrogen, and\r\nthese low numbers are always opposite to the purest animal substances.\r\n\r\n2. In consequence of containing so much nitrogen, animal substances\r\nare further distinguished by the rapidity with which, when moist, they\r\nputrify or run to decay. During this decay the nitrogen they contain\r\ngradually assumes the form of ammonia, which is perceptible by the\r\nsmell, and which, when proper precautions are not taken, is apt in\r\ngreat part to escape into the air. Hence the loss by fermenting manure\r\ntoo completely,—or without proper precautions to prevent the escape of\r\nvolatile substances. And as animal manure, when thus over-fermented, or\r\npermitted to lose its ammonia into the air, is found much less active\r\nupon vegetation than before; it is reasonably concluded, that to this\r\nammonia, chiefly, their peculiar virtue, when rightly prepared, is in a\r\ngreat measure to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nVegetable substances do not decay so rapidly,—do not emit the odour of\r\nammonia when fermenting,—nor, when prepared in the most careful way,\r\ndoes vegetable manure exhibit the same remarkable action upon vegetable\r\nlife as is displayed by almost every substance of animal origin.\r\n\r\n3. Whence do animal substances derive all this nitrogen? Animals live\r\nonly upon vegetable productions containing little nitrogen; can they\r\nthen procure all they require from this source alone? Again, does the\r\nact of digestion produce any chemical alteration upon the food of\r\nanimals, that their excretions should be a better manure,—should be\r\nricher in nitrogen than the substances on which they feed? Does theory\r\nthrow any light upon the opinion generally entertained among practical\r\nmen upon this point?\r\n\r\nThese two apparently distinct questions will be explained by a brief\r\nreference to one common natural principle.\r\n\r\nAnimals have two necessary vital functions to perform,—to breathe and\r\nto digest. Both are of equal importance to the health and general\r\nwelfare of the animal. The digester (the stomach) receives the food,\r\nmelts it down, extracts from it what is best suited to its purposes,\r\nand conveys it into the blood. The breathers (the lungs) sift the blood\r\nthus mixed up with the newly digested food, combine oxygen with it,\r\nand extract carbon,—which carbon, in the form of carbonic acid, they\r\ndischarge by the mouth and nostrils into the air.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general description of these two great processes,—their\r\neffect upon the food that remains in the body and has to be rejected\r\nfrom it, is not difficult to perceive.\r\n\r\nSuppose an animal to be full grown. Take a full grown man. All that he\r\neats as food is intended merely to renovate or replenish his system,\r\nto restore that which is daily removed from every part of his body by\r\nnatural causes. _In the full grown state, every thing that enters the\r\nbody must come out of the body_ in one form or another. The first part\r\nof the food that escapes is that portion of its carbon that passes off\r\nfrom the lungs during respiration. This quantity varies in different\r\nindividuals—chiefly according to the quantity of exercise they take.\r\nFrom 5 to 9 ounces a day is the average quantity, though in periods of\r\nviolent bodily exertion 13 to 15 ounces of carbon are breathed out in\r\nthe form of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nSuppose a man to eat a pound and a half of bread and a pound of beef in\r\n24 hours, and that he gives off by respiration 8 ounces of carbon (3500\r\ngrains) during the same time. Then he has\r\n\r\n                              Carbon.          Nitrogen.\r\n\r\n    Taken, in his food, about 4500 grains, and 500 grs. while\r\n\r\n    He has given off in     }\r\n    respiration,            } 3500 and little or no nitrogen,\r\n\r\n    Leaving to be converted }\r\n    into food, or to        } 1000 grs. and    500 grs.\r\n    be rejected,            }\r\n\r\nOur two conclusions, therefore, are clear. The vegetable food, by\r\nrespiration, is freed from a large portion of its carbon, which is\r\ndischarged into the air,—nearly the whole of the nitrogen remaining\r\nbehind. In the food consumed the carbon was to the nitrogen as 9 to 1;\r\nin that which remains, after respiration has done its work, the carbon\r\nis to the nitrogen in the proportion of only 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is out of this residue, rich in nitrogen, that the several parts of\r\nanimal bodies are built up. Hence the reason why they can be formed\r\nfrom food poor in nitrogen, and yet be themselves rich in the same\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nIt is this same residue also which, after it has performed its\r\nfunctions within the body, is discharged again in the form of solid and\r\nliquid excretions. Hence the greater richness in nitrogen,—the greater\r\nfertilizing power of the dung of animals than of the food on which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nTwo other remarks I shall add for the benefit of the practical man.\r\n\r\n1. The manure of the cow, taking it mixed, is not so rich in nitrogen\r\nas that of man,—because the cow in the stall, large though it be, and\r\ngreat the bulk of food it consumes, does not give off much more carbon\r\nby respiration than an active full grown man. Hence the proportion of\r\ncarbon in the excretions of this animal is greater than in those of\r\nman. The dry manure is richer than the dry food, weight for weight, but\r\nnot in the same proportion as if the cow respired a quantity of carbon\r\nmore nearly corresponding to its bulk, when compared with the weight of\r\ncarbon thrown off from the lungs of man.\r\n\r\n2. Since the parts of animals—their blood, muscles, tendons, and\r\nthe gelatinous portion of the bones—contain much nitrogen, young\r\nbeasts which are growing, must appropriate to their own use, and\r\nwork up into flesh and bone, a portion of the nitrogen contained\r\nin the _non-respired_ part of their food. But the more they thus\r\nappropriate, the less will pass off into the fold-yard; and hence it\r\nis natural to suppose that the manure, either liquid or solid, which\r\nis prepared where many growing cattle are fed, will not be so rich\r\nas that which is yielded by full grown animals. I am not aware how\r\nfar this deterioration has been observed in practice, but it may with\r\nsome degree of certainty be expected to take place,—unless by giving\r\na richer food to the young cattle, the difference to the farm-yard be\r\nmade up.[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Though I have dwelt as long upon these interesting and, I believe,\r\nnovel considerations, as the limits of this little work will permit,\r\nyet I must refer the reader for fuller details, and to perhaps a\r\nclearer exposition of the principles above advanced than I have here\r\nbeen able to give, to my “LECTURES _on Agricultural Chemistry and\r\nGeology_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.—OF MINERAL WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe general nature and mode of operation of such mineral substances as\r\nare capable of acting as manures, will be in some measure understood\r\nfrom what has already been so fully stated in regard to the necessity\r\nof inorganic food to living plants, and to the kinds of such food\r\nwhich they specially require. A slight notice, therefore, of the more\r\nimportant of these manures now in use will here be sufficient.\r\n\r\n1. _Nitrates of Potash and Soda._—Saltpetre and nitrate of soda have\r\nbeen deservedly commended for their beneficial action, especially\r\nupon _young_ vegetation. They are distinguished by imparting to the\r\nleaves a beautiful dark green colour, and are applied with advantage\r\nto grass and young corn, at the rate of 1 cwt. to ½ cwt. per acre. The\r\nnitric acid they contain yields nitrogen to the plant, while potash and\r\nsoda are also put within reach of its roots, and no doubt serve many\r\nbeneficial purposes.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Soda_, or Glauber’s salt, has lately been recommended in\r\nthis country for clovers, grasses, and green crops. Mixed with nitrate\r\nof soda it produces remarkable crops of potatoes.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] See the author’s “_Suggestions for Experiments in Practical\r\nAgriculture_,” Nos. 1 & 2.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Magnesia_, or Epsom salts, might also be beneficially\r\napplied in agriculture, probably to clovers and corn crops. As it can\r\nbe had in pure crystals at 10s. a cwt., and in an impure state at a\r\nmuch less price, from the alum works, it might readily be submitted to\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime_, or Gypsum, is in Germany applied to grass lands\r\nwith great success, over large tracts of country. In the United States\r\nit is used for every kind of crop. It is especially adapted to clovers\r\nand legumes.\r\n\r\nThese three substances all afford sulphur to the growing plant,\r\nwhile the lime, soda, and magnesia are themselves in part directly\r\nappropriated by it, and in part employed in preparing other kinds of\r\nfood, and in conveying them into the ascending sap.\r\n\r\nThough there can be no question that these and similar substances are\r\nreally useful to vegetation, yet the intelligent reader will not be\r\nsurprised to find, or to hear, that this or that mineral substance has\r\nnot succeeded in benefitting the land in this or that district. If he\r\nhas already bricks enough at hand, you must carry the builder mortar,\r\nor he will be unable to go on with his work: so, if the soil contain\r\ngypsum or sulphate of magnesia in sufficient natural abundance, it is\r\nat once a needless and a foolish waste to attempt to improve the land\r\nby adding more; it is still more foolish to conclude that these same\r\nsaline compounds are unlikely to reward the patient experimenter in\r\nother localities.\r\n\r\n_Common Salt_ has undoubtedly, in very many districts, a fertilizing\r\ninfluence upon the soil. The theoretical agriculturist knows that a\r\nsmall quantity of it is absolutely necessary to the healthy growth\r\nof all our cultivated crops, and he will therefore, early try by a\r\npreliminary experiment upon one of his fields, whether or not they\r\nrequire the addition of this species of vegetable food. It is in inland\r\nand sheltered situations, and on high lands often washed by the rains,\r\nthat the effect of common salt is likely to be most appreciable. The\r\nspray of the sea, borne to great distances by the winds, is in many\r\ndistricts, where prevailing sea winds are known, sufficient to supply\r\nan ample annual dressing of common salt to the land.\r\n\r\n_Kelp._—Among mineral substances kelp ought not properly to be\r\nincluded, since it is the ash left by the burning of sea-weed. It,\r\nhowever, partakes of the nature of mineral substances, and may,\r\ntherefore, be properly considered in this place. It contains potash,\r\nsoda, silica, sulphur, chlorine, and several other of the inorganic\r\nconstituents of plants required by them for food. It is nearly the same\r\nalso—with the exception of the organic matter which is burned away—with\r\nthe sea-weed which produces such remarkably beneficial effects upon the\r\nsoil. In the Western Isles a method is practised of half burning or\r\ncharring sea-weed, by which it is prevented from melting together, and\r\nis readily obtained in the form of a fine black powder. The use of this\r\nvariety ought to combine the beneficial action of the ordinary saline\r\nconstituents of kelp, with the remarkable properties observed in animal\r\nand vegetable charcoals.\r\n\r\n_Wood-ash_, among other compounds, contains a portion of common\r\n_pearl-ash_ in an impure form, with sulphate also, and _silicate_ of\r\npotash. These are all valuable in feeding and in preparing the food of\r\nplants, and hence the extensive use of wood-ash as a manure in every\r\ncountry where it can readily be procured.\r\n\r\n_Dutch ashes_ are the ashes of peat burned for the purpose of being\r\napplied to the land. They vary in constitution with the kind of peat\r\nfrom which they have been prepared. They often contain traces of potash\r\nand soda, and generally a quantity of gypsum and carbonate of lime, a\r\ntrace of phosphate of lime, and much siliceous matter. In almost every\r\ncountry where peat abounds, the value of peat ashes as a manure has\r\nbeen more or less generally recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.—USE OF LIME, SHELL-SAND, AND MARL.\r\n\r\nThe use of lime is of the greatest importance in practical\r\nagriculture. It has been employed, in Europe at least, in one or\r\nother of its forms of shells, shell-sand, marl, chalk, limestone, and\r\nquicklime, from the most remote periods.\r\n\r\nNative limestone, and all the unburned varieties of chalk, shells, &c.\r\nconsist of _carbonate of lime_ (p. 51), more or less pure. When burned\r\nin the kiln, the carbonic acid is driven off, and lime, burned lime, or\r\nquicklime remains.\r\n\r\nQuicklime, when exposed to the air, gradually falls into the state\r\nof an exceedingly fine white powder. It will do so more rapidly if\r\nwater be thrown upon it, when it also heats much, swells, and becomes\r\nabout one-third heavier than before. After being exposed to the air\r\nfor some time in this white powdery state, it is found to have again\r\nabsorbed from the air a portion of carbonic acid, though a very long\r\nperiod generally elapses before it is all reconverted into carbonate.\r\nIn compost heaps, where much carbonic acid is formed during the\r\nfermentation, the conversion of any quicklime that may be mixed with\r\nthem into carbonate of lime, is much more rapid and complete than in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nLime, therefore, is laid on the land in two states.\r\n\r\n_1st_, In the _mild_ state—that of carbonate—in marls, in chalk, in\r\nshell-sand, &c.\r\n\r\n_2d_, In the _caustic_, or quick state, as it comes hot from the kiln,\r\nor after it is simply slaked.\r\n\r\nLimes are laid on also in a more or less pure form. Marl contains only\r\nfrom 5 to 20 per cent. of carbonate of lime, generally in the state\r\nof a very fine powder. Shell-sand consists of a mixture of minute\r\nfragments of shells with from 20 to 50 per cent. of siliceous sand. The\r\nlimestones which are burned are also more or less impure, though, when\r\nthe impurity is very great, they do not burn well, and are therefore\r\nusually rejected.\r\n\r\nSome limestones contain much magnesia, by which their agricultural\r\nqualities are materially affected. These are known by the name of\r\n_magnesian_ limestones. There are few limestones in which a small\r\nquantity of magnesia may not be detected, and this minute proportion is\r\nlikely to be beneficial rather than otherwise; but when it is present\r\nto the amount of 10 per cent. or upwards, it appears to have for some\r\ntime a poisonous influence upon vegetation, if added in the same large\r\ndoses in which other lime may be safely spread upon the land.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of lime laid on at a single dressing, and the frequency\r\nwith which it may be repeated, must depend upon the kind of land, upon\r\nthe depth of the soil, and upon the species of culture to which it is\r\nsubjected. If land be wet, or badly drained, a larger application is\r\nnecessary to produce the same effect, and it must be more frequently\r\nrepeated. When the soil is thin, again, a smaller addition will\r\nthoroughly impregnate the whole, than where the plough usually descends\r\nto the depth of 8 or 10 inches. On old pasture lands, where the tender\r\ngrasses live in two or three inches of soil only, a feebler dressing,\r\nmore frequently repeated, appears to be the more reasonable practice,\r\nthough in reclaiming and laying down lands to grass, a heavy first\r\nliming is often indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn arable culture larger doses are admissible, both because the soil\r\nthrough which the roots penetrate must necessarily be deeper, and\r\nbecause the tendency to sink beyond the reach of the roots is generally\r\ncounteracted by the frequent turning up of the earth by the plough.\r\nWhere vegetable matter abounds, much lime may be usefully added, and on\r\nstiff clay lands after draining, its good effect is most remarkable.\r\nOn light land, chiefly because there is neither moisture nor vegetable\r\nmatter present in equal quantity, very large applications of lime are\r\nnot so usual, and some prefer adding it to such lands in the shape of\r\ncomposts only.\r\n\r\nThe largest doses, however, which are applied in practice, alter in\r\na very immaterial degree the chemical constitution of the soil. We\r\nhave seen that the best soils generally contain a natural proportion\r\nof lime, not fixed in quantity, yet scarcely ever wholly wanting. But\r\nan ordinary liming, when well mixed up with a deep soil, will rarely\r\namount to _one per cent._ of its entire weight. It requires about 300\r\nbushels of burned lime per acre to add one per cent. of lime to a soil\r\nof twelve inches in depth; if only mixed to a depth of six inches, this\r\nquantity would add about two per cent. to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable visible alterations produced by liming are—upon\r\n_pastures_, the greater fineness, closeness, and nutritive character\r\nof the grasses—on _arable lands_, the improvement in the texture and\r\nmellowness of stiff clays, the more productive crops and the earlier\r\nperiod at which they ripen.\r\n\r\nBut these effects gradually diminish year by year, till the land\r\nreturns again nearly to its original condition. On analyzing the\r\nsoil, the lime originally added is found to be in great measure, or\r\naltogether, gone. In this condition the land must either be limed\r\nagain, or must be left to produce sickly and un-remunerating crops.\r\n\r\nThis removal arises from two causes. The rain-water that descends upon\r\nthe land holds in solution carbonic acid which it has absorbed from\r\nthe air. But water charged with carbonic acid is capable of dissolving\r\ncarbonate of lime, and thus year after year the rains slowly remove\r\nas they sink to the drains, or run over the surface, a portion of the\r\nlime which the soil contains. Acid substances are also formed naturally\r\nin the land, by which another portion of the lime is rendered easily\r\nsoluble in water, and, therefore, readily removable by every shower\r\nthat falls.\r\n\r\nThe _chemical_ effects of lime upon the soil are chiefly the following:—\r\n\r\n1. When laid upon the land in the _caustic_ state, the first action of\r\nthe lime is to combine immediately with every portion of acid matter\r\nit may contain, and thus to sweeten the soil. Some of the compounds it\r\nthus forms being soluble in water, either enter into the roots and feed\r\nthe plant,—supplying it at once with lime and with organic matter,—or\r\nare washed out by the springs and rains, while other compounds, which\r\nare insoluble, remain more permanently in the soil.\r\n\r\n2. Another portion decomposes certain saline compounds of iron,\r\nmanganese, and alumina, which naturally form themselves in the soil,\r\nand thus renders them unhurtful to vegetation. A similar action is\r\nexerted upon certain compounds of potash and soda, and of ammonia,—if\r\nany such are present,—by which these substances are set and placed\r\nwithin the reach of the plant.\r\n\r\n3. Its presence in the caustic state further disposes the organic\r\nmatter of the soil to undergo more rapid decomposition—it being\r\nobserved, that where lime is present in readiness to combine with the\r\nsubstances produced during the decay of organic matter, that decay,\r\nif other circumstances be favourable, will proceed with much greater\r\nrapidity. The reader will not fail to recollect, that during this\r\ndecay many compounds are formed which are of importance in promoting\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n4. Further, quicklime has the advantage of being soluble in cold water,\r\nand thus the complete diffusion of it through the soil is aided by the\r\npower of water to carry it in solution in every direction.\r\n\r\n5. When it has absorbed carbonic acid, and become reconverted into\r\ncarbonate, the original caustic lime has no _chemical_ virtue over\r\nchalk, rich shell-sand or marl, or crushed limestone. It has, however,\r\nthe important _mechanical_ advantage of being in the form of a far\r\nfiner powder, than any to which we could reduce the limestone by\r\nart—in consequence of which it can be more uniformly diffused through\r\nthe soil, and placed within the reach of every root, and of almost\r\nevery particle, of vegetable matter that is undergoing decay. I shall\r\nmention only three of the important purposes which, in this state of\r\n_carbonate_, lime serves upon the land.\r\n\r\n1. It directly affords food to the plant, which, as we have seen,\r\nlanguishes where lime is not attainable. It serves also to convey other\r\nfood to the roots in a state in which it can be made available to\r\nvegetable growth.\r\n\r\n2. It neutralizes (removes the _sourness_) of all acid substances as\r\nthey are formed in the soil, and thus keeps the land in a condition to\r\nnourish the tenderest plants. This is one of the important agencies\r\nof shell-sand when laid on undrained grass lands—and this effect it\r\nproduces in common with wood-ashes, and many similar substances.\r\n\r\n3. During the decay of organic matter in the soil, it aids and\r\npromotes the production of nitric acid,—so influential, as I believe,\r\nin the general vegetation of the globe (see page 35). With this acid\r\nit combines and forms _nitrate of lime_—a substance very soluble in\r\nwater—entering readily, therefore, into the roots of plants, and\r\nproducing upon their growth effects precisely similar to those of the\r\nnow well known _nitrate of soda_. The success of frequent ploughings,\r\nharrowings, hoeings, and other modes of stirring the land, is partly\r\nowing to the facilities which these operations afford to the production\r\nof this and other natural nitrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.—OF THE IRRIGATION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nThe irrigation of the land is, in general, only a more refined method\r\nof manuring it. The nature of the process itself, however, is different\r\nin different countries, as are also the kind and degree of effect it\r\nproduces, and the theory by which these effects are to be explained.\r\n\r\nIn dry and arid climates, where rain rarely falls, the soil may contain\r\nall the elements of fertility, and require only water to call them\r\ninto operation. In such cases, as in the irrigations practised so\r\nextensively in eastern countries, and without which, whole provinces\r\nin Africa and Southern America would lie waste, it is unnecessary to\r\nsuppose any other virtue in irrigation than the mere supply of water it\r\naffords to the parched and cracking soil.\r\n\r\nBut in climates such as our own, there are two other beneficial\r\npurposes in reference to the soil, which irrigation may, and one at\r\nleast of which it always does, serve.\r\n\r\n2. The occasional flow of _pure_ water over the surface, as in\r\nour irrigated meadows, and its descent into the drains, where the\r\ndrainage is perfect, washes out acid and other noxious substances\r\nnaturally generated in the soil, and thus purifies and sweetens it.\r\nThe beneficial effect of such washing will be readily understood in\r\nthe case of peat lands laid down to water meadow, since, as every one\r\nknows, peat soils abound in matters unfavourable to general vegetation,\r\nand which are usually in part drawn off by drainage, and in part\r\ndestroyed by lime and by exposure to the air, before boggy lands can be\r\nbrought into profitable cultivation.\r\n\r\n3. But it seldom happens that _pure_ water is employed for the purposes\r\nof irrigation. The water of rivers, more generally, is diverted from\r\nits course, more or less loaded with mud and other finer particles of\r\nmatter, which are either gradually filtered from it as it passes over\r\nand through the soil, or in the case of floods subside naturally when\r\nthe waters come to rest. Or in less frequent cases, the drainings of\r\ntowns, and the waters from common sewers, or from the little streams\r\nenriched by them, are turned with benefit upon the favoured fields.\r\nThese are evidently cases of gradual and uniform manuring. And even\r\nwhere the water employed is clear and apparently undisturbed by mud,\r\nit always contains saline substances grateful to the plant in its\r\nsearch for food, and which it always contrives to extract more or less\r\ncopiously as the water passes over its leaves or along its roots. Every\r\nfresh access of water affords the grass in reality another liquid\r\nmanuring.\r\n\r\nIn the refreshment continually afforded to the plant by a plentiful\r\nsupply of water, in the removal of noxious substances from the soil, or\r\nin the frequent additions of enriching food to the land—the efficiency\r\nof irrigation, therefore, seems entirely to consist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.—OF PARING AND BURNING, AND OF BURNED CLAY.\r\n\r\nA mode of improvement often resorted to is the paring and burning of\r\npoor land. The efficacy of burned clay, also, even in superseding\r\nmanure on good lands, has been highly extolled by some practical men.\r\n\r\n1. The effect of paring and burning is easily understood. The matted\r\nsods consist of a mixture of much vegetable with a comparatively small\r\nquantity of earthy matter. When these are burned the ash of the plants\r\nonly is left, intimately mixed with the calcined earth. To strew this\r\nmixture over the soil is much the same as to dress it with peat or\r\nwood ashes, the beneficial effect of which upon vegetation is almost\r\nuniversally recognised. And the beneficial influence of the ash itself\r\nis chiefly due to the ready supply of inorganic food it yields to the\r\nseed, and to the effect which the potash and soda it contains exercise\r\neither in preparing organic food in the soil, or in assisting its\r\ndigestion and assimilation in the interior of the plant.\r\n\r\nAnother part of this process is, that the roots of the weeds and poorer\r\ngrasses are materially injured by the paring, and that the subsequent\r\ndressing of ashes is unfavourable to their further growth.\r\n\r\n2. Much greater uncertainty hangs over the alleged virtues of burned\r\nclay. That benefits are supposed to have been derived from its use\r\nthere can be no doubt, though in many cases the better tillage of the\r\nland generally prescribed along with the use of burned clay, may have\r\nhad some share in producing the good results actually experienced\r\nduring its use.\r\n\r\nBy the burning, in kilns or otherwise, any organic matter the clay may\r\ncontain will be consumed, and the texture of the clay itself will be\r\nmechanically altered. It will crumble down like a burned brick into a\r\nhard friable powder, and will never again cohere into a paste as before\r\nthe burning. It will, therefore, render clay soils more open, and may\r\nthus, when mixed in large quantity, produce a permanent amelioration\r\nin the mechanical texture of many stiff wheat soils. It cannot itself\r\nundergo any chemical change that is likely so to alter its constitution\r\nas to make it a more useful chemical constituent of the soil than\r\nbefore. Any saline matter we may suppose to be set free could be far\r\nmore cheaply added in the form of a top-dressing to the soil.\r\n\r\nBricks, however, are generally more porous than the clay from which\r\nthey are formed; burned clay is so also. And all porous substances suck\r\nin and _condense_ much air and many vapours in large quantities into\r\ntheir pores. In consequence of this property, porous substances, like\r\ncharcoal and burned clay, are supposed, when mixed with the soil, to be\r\ncontinually yielding air to decaying vegetable matter on the one hand,\r\nand as continually re-absorbing it from the atmosphere on the other,\r\nand by this means to be of singular service in supplying the wants of\r\nplants in the earlier seasons of their growth. The vapours of nitric\r\nacid and of ammonia, which float in the air, they are also supposed to\r\nimbibe, and by the beneficial action of the substances believed to be\r\nthus conveyed by burned clay into the soil, the fertilizing virtues\r\nascribed to it are attempted to be explained.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that on this point considerable\r\nobscurity still rests. It is in some measure doubtful what the true\r\naction of charcoal and of burned clay is, both in _kind_ and in\r\n_quantity_. It is the part of science, therefore, to decline offering\r\nmore than a mere conjecture till the facts to be explained are more\r\nfully and satisfactorily demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.—PLANTING AND LAYING DOWN TO GRASS.\r\n\r\n1. _Planting._—It has been observed that lands which are unfit for\r\narable culture, and which yield only a trifling rent as natural\r\npasture, are yet in many cases capable of growing profitable\r\nplantations, and of being greatly increased in permanent value by the\r\nprolonged growth of wood. Not only, however, do all trees not thrive\r\nalike on the same soil, but all do not improve the soil on which they\r\ngrow in an equal degree.\r\n\r\nUnder the Scotch fir, for example, the pasture is not worth 6d. more\r\nper acre than before it was planted—under the beech and spruce, it\r\nis worth even less than before, though the spruce affords excellent\r\nshelter;—under ash, it gradually acquires an increased value of 2s.\r\nor 3s. per acre. In oak copses, it becomes worth 5s. or 6s., but only\r\nduring the last eight years (of the twenty-four), before it is cut\r\ndown. But under the larch, after the first thirty years, when the\r\nthinnings are all cut, land not worth originally more than 1s. per\r\nacre, becomes worth 8s. to 10s. per acre for permanent pasture.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] The result of trials made on the _mica slate_ and _gneiss soils_\r\n(see page 100) of the Duke of Atholl.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this improvement is to be found in the nature of the soil,\r\nwhich gradually accumulates beneath the trees by the shedding of their\r\nleaves. The shelter from the sun and rain which the foliage affords,\r\nprevents the vegetable matter which falls from being so speedily\r\ndecomposed, or from being so much washed away, and thus permits it to\r\ncollect in larger quantities in a given time, than where no such cover\r\nexists. The more complete the shelter, therefore, the more rapid will\r\nthe accumulation of soil be in so far as it depends upon this cause.\r\n\r\nBut the quantity of leaves which annually falls has also much influence\r\nupon the extent to which the soil is capable of being improved by any\r\ngiven species of tree, as well as the degree of rapidity with which\r\nthose leaves, under ordinary circumstances, undergo decay. The broad\r\nmembranous leaf of the beech and oak decay more quickly than the\r\nneedle-shaped leaves of the pine tribes, and this circumstance may\r\nassist in rendering the larch more valuable as a permanent improver.\r\n\r\nWe should expect likewise that the quantity and quality of the\r\ninorganic matter contained in the leaves,—brought up year by year from\r\nthe roots, and strewed afterwards uniformly over the surface where the\r\nleaves are shed,—would materially affect the value of the soil they\r\nform. The leaves of the oak contain about 5 per cent. of saline and\r\nearthy matter, and those of the Scotch fir less than 2 per cent.; so\r\nthat, supposing the actual weight of leaves which falls from each kind\r\nof tree to be equal, we should expect a greater depth of soil to be\r\nformed in the same time by the oak than by the Scotch fir. I am not\r\naware of any experiments on the quantity of ash left by the leaves of\r\nthe larch.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the land, therefore, by the planting of trees,\r\ndepends in part upon the quantity of _organic_ food which the trees\r\ncan extract from the air, and afterwards drop in the form of leaves\r\nupon the soil, and in part upon the kind and quantity of _inorganic_\r\nmatter which the roots can bring up from beneath, and in like manner\r\nstrew upon the surface. The quantity and quality of the latter will, in\r\na great measure, determine the kind of grasses which will spring up,\r\nand the consequent value of the pasture in the feeding of stock. In the\r\nlarch districts of the Duke of Atholl, the most abundant grasses that\r\nspring up are said to be the holcus mollis and the holcus lanatus, (the\r\n_creeping_ and the _meadow_ soft-grasses.)\r\n\r\n2. _Laying down to grass._—On this point two facts seem to be pretty\r\ngenerally acknowledged:\r\n\r\n_First_, that land laid down to artificial grasses for one, two, three,\r\nor more years, is in some degree rested or recruited, and is fitted for\r\nthe better production of after-corn crops. Letting it lie a year or two\r\nlonger in grass, therefore, is one of the received modes of bringing\r\nback to a sound condition a soil that has been exhausted by injudicious\r\ncropping.\r\n\r\n_Second_, that land thus laid down with artificial grasses deteriorates\r\nmore or less after two or three years, and only by slow degrees\r\nacquires a thick sward of rich and nourishing herbage. Hence the\r\nopinion, that grass-land improves in quality the longer it is\r\npermitted to lie,—the unwillingness to plough up old pasture,—and the\r\ncomparatively high rents which, in some parts of the country, old grass\r\nlands are known to yield.\r\n\r\nGranting that grass lands do thus _generally_ increase in value,\r\n_three_ important facts must be borne in mind before we attempt to\r\nassign the cause of this improvement, or the circumstances under which\r\nit is likely to take place for the longest time and to the greatest\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n1. The value of the grass in any given spot may increase for an\r\nindefinite period—but it will never improve beyond a certain extent—it\r\nwill necessarily be limited, as all other crops are, by the quality\r\nof the land. Hence the mere laying down to grass will not make _all_\r\nland _good_, however long it may lie. The extensive commons, heaths,\r\nand wastes, which have been in grass from the most remote times, are\r\nevidence of this. They have in most cases yielded so poor a herbage\r\nas to have been considered unworthy of being enclosed as a permanent\r\npasture.\r\n\r\n2. Some grass lands will retain the good condition they thus slowly\r\nacquire for a very long period, and _without manuring_, in the same\r\nway, and upon the same principle, that some rich corn lands have\r\nyielded successive crops for 100 years without manure. The rich grass\r\nlands of England, and especially of Ireland, many of which have been in\r\npasture from time immemorial, without, it is said, receiving any return\r\nfor all they have yielded, are illustrations of this fact.\r\n\r\n3. But that others, if grazed, cropped with sheep or meadowed, will\r\ngradually deteriorate, unless some proper supply of manure be given to\r\nthem,—which required supply must vary with the nature of the soil, and\r\nwith the kind of treatment to which it has been subjected.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the acknowledged benefit of laying down to grass, then,\r\ntwo points require consideration,—what form does it assume?—and how is\r\nit effected?\r\n\r\n1. The improvement takes place by the gradual accumulation of a\r\ndark-brown soil on the surface, rich in vegetable matter: and which\r\nsoil thickens or deepens in proportion to the time which elapses from\r\nits being first laid down to grass.\r\n\r\nIf the soil be very light and sandy, the thickening is sooner arrested;\r\nif it be moderately heavy land, the improvement continues for a longer\r\nperiod; and some of the heaviest clays in England are known to bear\r\nthe richest permanent pastures. On analyzing the soils of the richest\r\nof these pastures, whatever be the degree of tenacity of the clays\r\nor loams (the subsoils) on which they rest, or their deficiency in\r\nvegetable matter,—they are found to be generally characterized by\r\ncontaining from 8 to 12 per cent. of organic, chiefly vegetable matter,\r\nfrom 5 to 10 only of alumina, and from 1 to 6 per cent. of lime.\r\n\r\nThus the soil formed on the surface of all rich old pasture lands\r\nis possessed of a remarkable degree of uniformity,—both in physical\r\ncharacter and in chemical composition. This uniformity they gradually\r\n_acquire_, even upon the stiff clays of the Lias and of the Oxford\r\nclay, which originally, no doubt, have been,—as many clay lands still\r\nare,—left to natural pasture from the difficulty and expense of\r\nsubmitting them to arable culture.\r\n\r\n2. But how do they acquire this new character, and why is it the work\r\nof so much time? When the young grass throws up its leaves into the\r\nair, from which it derives so much of its nourishment, it throws down\r\nits roots into the soil in quest of food of another kind. The leaves\r\nmay be mown or cropped by animals, and carried off the field, but the\r\nroots remain in the soil, and, as they die, gradually fill its upper\r\npart with vegetable matter. It is not known what average proportion the\r\nroots of the natural grasses bear to the leaves; no doubt it varies\r\nmuch, both with the kind of grass and with the kind of soil. When wheat\r\nis cut down, the quantity of straw left in the field, in the form of\r\nstubble and roots, is sometimes greater than the quantity carried off\r\nin the sheaf. Upon a grass field two or three tons of hay may be reaped\r\nfrom an acre; and if we suppose only a tenth part of this quantity to\r\ndie every year in the form of roots or parts of roots, or of excretions\r\nfrom roots, we can easily understand how the vegetable matter in\r\nthe soil thus gradually accumulating, should at length become very\r\nconsiderable in quantity. In arable land this accumulation is prevented\r\nby the constant turning up of the soil, by which the vegetable fibres\r\nbeing exposed to the free access of air and moisture, are made to\r\nundergo a more rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\nBut the roots and leaves of the grasses contain inorganic earthy and\r\nsaline matter also. Dry hay leaves from an eighth to a tenth part of\r\nits weight of ash when burned. Along with the dead vegetable matter of\r\nthe soil, this inorganic matter accumulates also on the surface, in the\r\nform of an exceedingly fine earthy powder; hence _one_ cause of the\r\nuniversal fineness of the surface mould of old grass fields. And the\r\nearthy portion of this inorganic matter consists chiefly of silica and\r\nlime, with scarcely a trace of alumina, so that, even on the stiffest\r\nclays, a surface soil may be ultimately formed, in which the quantity\r\nof alumina will be comparatively small.\r\n\r\nBut there are still other agencies at work by which the surface of\r\nstiff soils is made to undergo a change. As the roots penetrate into\r\nthe clay, they more or less open up a way into it for the rains. Now\r\nthe rains in nearly all lands, when they have a passage downwards,\r\nhave a tendency to carry down the clay along with them. They do so,\r\nit has been observed, on sandy and peaty soils, and more quickly when\r\nthese soils are laid down to grass. Hence the mechanical action of the\r\nrains,—slowly in many localities, yet surely,—has a tendency to lighten\r\nthe soil, by removing a portion of its clay. They constitute one of\r\nthose natural agencies by which, as elsewhere explained, important\r\ndifferences are ultimately established, almost everywhere, between the\r\nsurface crop-bearing soil and the subsoil on which it rests.\r\n\r\nBut further, the heats of summer and the frosts of winter aid this slow\r\nalteration. In the extremes of heat and of cold, the soil contracts\r\nmore than the roots of the grasses do; and similar though less striking\r\ndifferences take place during the changes of temperature experienced\r\nin our climate in a single day. When the rain falls on the parched\r\nfield, or when a thaw comes on, the earth expands, while the roots of\r\nthe grasses remain nearly fixed; hence the soil rises up among the\r\nleaves, mixes with the vegetable matter, and thus assists in the slow\r\naccumulation of a rich vegetable mould.\r\n\r\nThe reader has witnessed in winter how, on a field or a by-way side,\r\nthe earth rises above the stones, and appears inclined to cover them;\r\nhe may even have seen in a deserted and undisturbed highway, the stones\r\ngradually sinking and disappearing altogether, when the repetition of\r\nthis alternate contraction and expansion of the soil for a succession\r\nof winters has increased in a great degree the effects which follow\r\nfrom a single accession of frosty weather.\r\n\r\nSo it is in the fields. And if a person skilled in the soils of a given\r\ndistrict can make a guess at the time when a given field was laid\r\ndown to grass, by the depth at which the stones are found beneath the\r\nsurface, it is because this loosening and expansion of the soil, while\r\nthe stones remain fixed, tends to throw the latter down by an almost\r\nimperceptible quantity every year that passes.\r\n\r\nSuch movements as these act in opening up the surface-soil, in mixing\r\nit with the decaying vegetable matter, and in allowing the slow action\r\nof the rains gradually to give its earthy portion a lighter character.\r\nBut with these, among other causes, conspire also the action of living\r\nanimals. Few persons have followed the plough without occasionally\r\nobserving the vast quantities of earthworms with which some fields seem\r\nto be filled. On a close shaven lawn many have noticed the frequent\r\nlittle heaps of earth which these worms during the night have thrown\r\nout upon the grass. These and other minute animals are continually\r\nat work, especially beneath an undisturbed and grassy sward—and they\r\nnightly bring up from a considerable depth, and discharge on the\r\nsurface, their burden of fine fertilizing loamy earth. Each of these\r\nburdens is an actual gain to the rich surface soil, and who can doubt\r\nthat in the lapse of years, the unseen and unappreciated labours of\r\nthese insect tribes must both materially improve its quality and\r\nincrease its depth?\r\n\r\nThere are natural causes, then, which we _know_ to be at work, that are\r\nsufficient to account for nearly all the facts that have been observed,\r\nin regard to the effect of laying lands down to grass. Stiff clays will\r\ngradually become lighter on the surface, and if the subsoil be rich in\r\nall the kinds of inorganic food which the grasses require, will go\r\non improving for an indefinite period without the aid of manure. Let\r\nthem, however, be deficient, or let them gradually become exhausted of\r\nany one kind of this food, and the grass lands will either gradually\r\ndeteriorate after they have reached a certain degree of excellence—or\r\nthey must be supplied with that ingredient—that manure of which they\r\nstand in need. It is doubtful if any pasture lands are so naturally\r\nrich as to bear to be cropped for centuries without the addition of\r\nmanure, and at the same time without deterioration.[21]\r\n\r\n[21] See pages 240 and 241.\r\n\r\nOn soils that are light, again, which naturally contain little clay,\r\nthe grasses will thrive more rapidly, a thick sward will be sooner\r\nformed, but the tendency of the rains to wash out the clay may prevent\r\nthem from ever attaining that luxuriance which is observed upon the old\r\npastures of the clay lands.\r\n\r\nOn undrained heaths and commons, and generally on any soil which is\r\ndeficient in some fertilizing element, neither abundant herbage, nor\r\ngood crops of any other kind, can be expected to flourish. Laying such\r\nlands down, or permitting them to remain in grass, may prepare them\r\nfor by-and-by yielding one or two average crops of corn, but cannot be\r\nexpected _alone_ to convert them into valuable pasture.\r\n\r\nFinally, plough up the old pastures, on the surface of which this light\r\nand most favourable soil has been long accumulating—and the heavy soil\r\nfrom beneath will be again mixed up with it—the vegetable matter will\r\ndisappear rapidly by exposure to the air,—and if again laid down to\r\ngrass, the slow changes of many years must again be begun through the\r\nagency of the same natural causes, before it become capable of again\r\nbearing the same rich herbage it was known to nourish while it lay\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nMany have supposed that by sowing down with the _natural_ grasses, a\r\nthick sward may at once be obtained—and on light loamy lands, rich in\r\nvegetable matter, this method may, to a certain extent, succeed—but on\r\nheavy lands, in which vegetable matter is defective, disappointment\r\nwill often follow the sowing of the most carefully selected seeds.\r\nBy the agency of the causes above adverted to—_the soil gradually\r\nchanges_, so that it is unfit, when first laid down, to bear those\r\ngrasses which, ten or twenty years afterwards, will naturally and\r\nluxuriantly grow upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Products of Vegetation—Importance of\r\n        _Chemical_ quality as well as quantity of\r\n        Produce—Influence of different Manures on the\r\n        quantity and quality of the Crop—Influence of the\r\n        time of Cutting—Absolute quantity of Food yielded\r\n        by different Crops—Principles on which the Feeding\r\n        of Animals depends—Theoretical and experimental\r\n        value of different kinds of Food for Feeding\r\n        Stock—Concluding Observations.\r\n\r\nThe first object of the practical farmer is, to reap from his land the\r\nlargest possible return of the most valuable crops, without permanently\r\nexhausting the soil. With this view he adopts one or other of the\r\nmethods of treatment above adverted to, by which either the physical\r\ncondition or the chemical constitution of the soil is altered for\r\nthe better. It may be useful to shew how very much both the quantity\r\nand the quality of a crop is dependent upon the mode in which it is\r\ncultivated and reaped, and how much control, therefore, the skilful\r\nagriculturist really possesses over the ordinary productions of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—OF THE INFLUENCE OF MANURE ON THE QUANTITY OF THE WHEAT AND\r\nOTHER CORN CROPS.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that some soils naturally produce much larger returns\r\nof wheat, oats, and barley than others do, and that the same soil will\r\nproduce more or less according to the mode in which the land has been\r\nprepared by manure, or otherwise, for the reception of the seed. The\r\nfollowing table shews the effect produced upon the quantity of the crop\r\nby _equal quantities_ of different manures applied to the _same soil_,\r\nsown with an equal quantity of the same seed.\r\n\r\n                         Return in bushels from each\r\n     Manure applied.          bushel of seed.\r\n                       Wheat.  Barley.   Oats.  Rye.\r\n    Blood,              14       16     12½      14\r\n    Night-soil,          —       13     14½      13½\r\n    Sheep’s dung,       12       16     14       13\r\n    Horse dung,         10       13     14       11\r\n    Pigeon’s dung,       —       10     12        9\r\n    Cow dung,            7       11     16        9\r\n    Vegetable matter,    3        7     13        6\r\n    Without manure,      —        4      5        4\r\n\r\nIt is probable that on different soils the returns obtained by the use\r\nof these several manures may not be always in the same order, yet,\r\ngenerally speaking, it will always be found that blood, night-soil, and\r\nsheep, horse, and pigeon’s dung, are among the most enriching manures\r\nthat can be employed.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen a theoretical reason for believing that night-soil\r\nshould be among the most enriching manures, and the result of actual\r\ntrial here shews that it is one of the most practically valuable which\r\nthe farmer can employ.\r\n\r\nTwo other facts will strike the practical man on looking at the above\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n1. That exclusive of blood, sheep’s dung gave the greatest increase in\r\nthe barley crop. The favourite Norfolk system of eating off turnips\r\nwith sheep previous to barley, besides other benefits which are known\r\nto attend the practice, may owe part of its acknowledged utility to\r\nthis powerful action of sheep’s dung upon the barley crop.\r\n\r\n2. The action of cow dung upon oats is equally striking, and the\r\nlarge return obtained by the use of vegetable manure alone—thirteen\r\nfold—may perhaps explain why in poorly farmed districts oats should be\r\na favourite and comparatively profitable crop, and why they may be\r\ncultivated with a certain degree of success on lands to which no rich\r\nmanure is ever added.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—INFLUENCE OF THE KIND OF MANURE ON THE CHEMICAL QUALITY OF\r\nTHE GRAIN.\r\n\r\nBut the quality of the grain also, as well as its quantity, is\r\nmaterially affected by the kind of manure by which its growth is\r\nassisted. The apparent quality of wheat and oats is very various; but\r\nin samples apparently equal in quality, important chemical differences\r\nmay exist, by which it is believed that the nourishing properties of\r\nthe grain are materially affected.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated in a previous chapter (p. 43), that when flour is\r\nmade into dough, and this dough is washed upon a linen cloth with water\r\nas long as the latter passes through milky,—the flour is separated into\r\n_starch_, which subsides from the water, and _gluten_, which remains\r\nbehind. The quantity of gluten thus left varies more or less with\r\nalmost every sample of flour, and the nutritive properties of each\r\nsample are supposed to depend very much upon the quantity of gluten it\r\ncontains. So far it seems to be pretty well ascertained, that those\r\nvarieties of grain which contain the largest amount of gluten yield\r\nalso the greatest return of flour, and the heaviest weight of bread.\r\n\r\nThe weight of gluten contained in 100 lbs. of dry wheat has been found\r\nto vary from 8 to 34 lbs., and this proportion is affected in a very\r\nremarkable manner by the kind of manure which has been applied to the\r\nland. Thus the proportions of starch and gluten in 100 lbs. of the\r\ngrain of the same wheat, grown on the same land, differently manured,\r\nwas as follows:—\r\n\r\n        Manure.        Starch.  Gluten.\r\n    Blood,             41 lbs.  34 lbs.\r\n    Sheep’s dung,      42  ”    33  ”\r\n    Horse dung,        62  ”    14  ”\r\n    Cow dung,          62  ”    12  ”\r\n    Vegetable manure,  66  ”    10  ”\r\n\r\nPotato-flour, which consists entirely of starch, makes a fine light\r\nbread, easily raised. Wheaten-flour, which contains little gluten,\r\napproaches in this respect to potato-flour. When the quantity of gluten\r\nis large, greater care is required to make a good light bread; but\r\nthe bread from such flour is generally found to be more nutritive in\r\nits quality. A dough peculiarly rich in gluten is required for the\r\nmanufacture of macaroni and vermicelli; such is said to be the flour\r\nnaturally produced in southern Italy. By the above table it appears,\r\nthat the use of richer animal, or poorer vegetable manures, would\r\nenable the farmer to raise, at his pleasure, either a rich macaroni\r\nwheat, or one poor in gluten suited for the makers of fancy bread.\r\n\r\nAn equally striking effect is not produced upon other kinds of grain by\r\nvarying the manure. Thus the proportions of starch and gluten in the\r\ndry grain of barley and oats, differently manured, were found to be as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                           BARLEY.            OATS.\r\n                       Starch.  Gluten.  Starch.  Gluten.\r\n    Blood,             66½       6½       60       5½\r\n    Night-soil,        66        6½       60       5\r\n    Sheep dung,        66½       6½       61       4½\r\n    Horse dung,        66        6½       61½      4½\r\n    Cow dung,          69        3½       62       3½\r\n    Vegetable manure,  69        3        66½      2¼\r\n    Unmanured,         69½       3        66½      2¼\r\n\r\nThough a variation in the proportion of gluten can be observed in both\r\nof these kinds of grain, according as one or other of the above kinds\r\nof manure was employed, yet neither the average quantity of gluten\r\npresent in them, nor the variations to which the quantity is liable,\r\nare at all equal in amount to what are observed in the case of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe malting of barley is known to be affected by a variety of\r\ncircumstances. It should be so uniform in ripeness as to sprout\r\nuniformly, so that no part of it should be beginning to shoot when\r\nthe rest has already germinated sufficiently for the maker’s purpose.\r\nOn this perfect sprouting of the _whole_ depends in some degree the\r\nswelling of the malt, which is of considerable consequence to the\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\nBut the _melting_ quality of the grain, which is of more consequence\r\nto the brewer and distiller, is modified chiefly by the proportion of\r\ngluten which the barley contains. That which contains the least gluten,\r\nand therefore the most starch, will melt the most easily and the most\r\ncompletely, and will yield the strongest beer or spirit from the same\r\nquantity of grain. Hence the preference given by the brewer to the\r\nmalt of particular districts, even where the sample appears otherwise\r\ninferior. Thus the brewers on the sea-board of the county of Durham\r\nwill not purchase the barley of their own neighbourhood, while Norfolk\r\ngrain can be had at a moderate increase of price. But that which\r\nrefuses to melt well in the hands of the brewer, will cause pigs and\r\nother stock to thrive well in the hands of the feeder, and this is the\r\nchief outlet for the barley which the brewer and distiller reject.\r\n\r\nSo far as a practical deduction can be drawn from the effects of\r\ndifferent manures on the proportion of gluten in barley, it would\r\nappear that the larger the quantity of cow dung contained in the manure\r\napplied to barley land—in other words, _the greater the numbers of\r\nstock folded about the farm-yard, the more likely is the barley to be\r\nsuch as will bring a high price from the brewer_.\r\n\r\nThe folding of _sheep_ produces a larger return (p. 206), from the\r\nbarley crop—while the folding of _cattle_ gives grain of a better\r\nmalting quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—INFLUENCE OF THE TIME OF CUTTING, ON THE QUANTITY AND\r\nQUALITY OF THE PRODUCE.\r\n\r\nThe period at which hay is cut, or corn reaped, materially affects the\r\nquantity (by weight) and the quality of the produce. It is commonly\r\nknown that when radishes are left too long in the ground they become\r\nhard and woody—that the soft turnippy stem of the young cabbage\r\nundergoes a similar change as the plant grows old,—and that the\r\nartichoke becomes tough and uneatable if left too long uncut. The same\r\nnatural change goes on in the grasses which are cut for hay.\r\n\r\nIn the blades and stems of the young grasses there is much sugar,\r\nwhich, as they grow up, is gradually changed, first into starch, and\r\nthen into woody fibre (pages 44 and 45.) The more completely the latter\r\nchange is effected—that is, the riper the plant becomes—the less sugar\r\nand starch, both readily soluble substances, they contain. And though\r\nit has been ascertained that woody fibre is not wholly indigestible,\r\nbut that the cow, for example, can appropriate a portion of it for food\r\nas it passes through her stomach; yet the reader will readily imagine,\r\nthat those parts of the food which dissolve most easily, are also\r\nlikely—other things being equal—to be most nourishing to the animal.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained, also, that the weight of hay or straw reaped, is\r\nactually less when allowed to become fully ripe; and therefore, by\r\ncutting soon after the plant has attained its greatest height, a larger\r\nquantity, as well as a better quality of hay, will be obtained, while\r\nthe land also will be less exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to crops of corn,—both to the straw and to the\r\ngrain they yield. The _rawer_ the crop is cut, the heavier and more\r\nnourishing the straw. Within three weeks of being fully ripe, the straw\r\nbegins to diminish in weight, and the longer it remains uncut after\r\nthat time, the lighter it becomes and the less nourishing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ear which is sweet and milky a month before it\r\nis ripe, gradually consolidates, the sugar changing into starch, and\r\nthe milk thickening into the gluten and the _albumen_[22] of the flour.\r\nAs soon as this change is nearly completed, or about a fortnight before\r\nripening, the grain contains the largest proportion of starch and\r\ngluten; if reaped at this time, the bushel will be heavier, and will\r\nyield the largest quantity of fine flour and the least bran.\r\n\r\n[22] _Albumen_ is the name given by chemists to the _white of the egg_.\r\nA small quantity of this substance is present in every kind of grain.\r\nIt is closely related to gluten.\r\n\r\nAt this period the grain has a thin skin, and hence the small quantity\r\nof bran. But if the crop be still left uncut, the next natural step in\r\nthe ripening process is, to cover the grain with a better protection,\r\na thicker skin. A portion of the starch of the grain is changed into\r\nwoody fibre,—precisely as in the ripening of hay, of the soft shoots of\r\nthe dog-rose, and of the roots of the common radish. By this change,\r\ntherefore, the quantity of starch is lessened and the weight of husk\r\nincreased; hence the diminished yield of flour, and the increased\r\nproduce of bran.\r\n\r\nTheory and experience, therefore, indicate about a fortnight before\r\nfull ripening as the most proper time for cutting corn. The skin is\r\nthen thinner, the grain fuller, the bushel heavier, the yield of flour\r\ngreater, the quantity of bran less; while, at the same time, the straw\r\nis heavier, and contains more soluble matter than when it is left uncut\r\nuntil it is considered to be fully ripe.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] On this subject the reader will consult with advantage an\r\nexcellent practical paper in the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_ for\r\nJune 1841, by Mr. Hannam of North Deighton, Yorkshire, to whom I have\r\nto express my obligations for information regarding the results of some\r\nfurther experiments made by him during the last autumn (1841).\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.—ON THE ABSOLUTE QUANTITY OF FOOD YIELDED BY DIFFERENT CROPS.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of food capable of yielding nourishment to man, which can\r\nbe grown from an acre of land of average quality, depends very much\r\nupon the kind of crop we raise.\r\n\r\nIn seeds, when fully ripe, little sugar or gum is generally present,\r\nand it is chiefly by the amount of starch and gluten they contain, that\r\ntheir nutritive power is to be estimated. In bulbs, such as the turnip\r\nand potato, sugar and gum are almost always present in considerable\r\nquantity in the state in which these roots are consumed, and this is\r\nespecially the case with the turnip. These substances, therefore, must\r\nbe included among the nutritive ingredients of such kinds of food.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose an acre of land to yield the following quantities of the\r\nusually cultivated crops, namely—\r\n\r\n    Of wheat,        25 bushels, or  1500 lbs.\r\n    Of barley,       38    ”     or  2000  ”\r\n    Of oats,         50    ”     or  2250  ”\r\n    Of peas,         15    ”     or  1000  ”\r\n    Of beans,        25    ”     or  1600  ”\r\n    Of Indian corn,  60    ”     or  3120  ”\r\n    Of potatoes,     10  tons,   or 22400  ”\r\n    Of turnips,      25    ”     or 56000  ”\r\n\r\nThe weight of dry starch, gluten, sugar, and gum, reaped in each crop,\r\nwill be represented very nearly by the following numbers:—\r\n\r\n                   Starch.   Gluten and  Sugar and  Woody\r\n                              Albumen.      Gum.    Fibre.\r\n    Wheat,         825 lbs.   315 lbs.       60       —\r\n    Barley,       1200  ”     120  ”        160       —\r\n    Oats,         1215  ”     100  ”        250       —\r\n    Peas,          420  ”     260  ”         20       —\r\n    Beans,         670  ”     370  ”          —       —\r\n    Indian corn,  2100  ”     280  ”         90       —\r\n    Potatoes,     2688  ”     224  ”          —      1253\r\n    Turnips,      3090  ”    1400  ”       5000       —\r\n\r\nIf it be granted that the crops above stated are fair average returns\r\nfrom the same quality of land—that the acre, for example, which\r\nproduces 25 bushels of wheat, will also produce 10 tons of potatoes,\r\nand so on—then it appears that the land which, by cropping with wheat,\r\nwould yield a given weight of _starch_, would, when cropped with barley\r\nor oats, yield one-half more, with Indian corn or potatoes about three\r\ntimes as much, and with turnips five times the same quantity. In other\r\nwords, the piece of ground which, when sown with wheat, will maintain\r\none man, would support one and a half if sown with barley or oats,\r\nthree with Indian corn or potatoes, and five with _turnips_—_in so far\r\nas the nutritive power of these crops depends upon the starch and sugar\r\nthey contain_.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we compare the relative quantities of gluten, we see that\r\nwheat, beans, and Indian corn yield, from the same breadth of land,\r\nnearly an equal quantity of this kind of nourishment—potatoes one-third\r\nless, and barley and oats only one-third of the quantity—while turnips\r\nyield four times as much as either wheat, beans, or Indian corn.\r\n\r\nOn whichever of these two substances, therefore, the starch or the\r\ngluten, we consider the nutritive property of the above kind of food\r\nto depend, it appears that the turnip is by far the most nutritive\r\ncrop we can raise. It is by no means the most nutritive weight for\r\nweight, but the largeness of the crop (25 tons) affords us from the\r\nsame field a much greater weight of food than can be reaped in the form\r\nof any of the other crops here mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn this the practical farmer will see the peculiar adaptation of the\r\nturnip husbandry to the rearing and fattening of stock. Could the\r\nturnip be made an agreeable article of general human consumption, the\r\nproduce of the land might be made to sustain a much larger population\r\nthan under any other of the above kinds of cropping.\r\n\r\nThe relative nourishing power or value as food of different vegetable\r\nsubstances, is supposed by some to depend entirely upon the relative\r\nproportions of gluten they contain. According to this view, the pea and\r\nthe bean are much more nourishing, weight for weight, even than wheat,\r\nand this latter grain, than any of the other substances mentioned in\r\nthe above table. Thus, 56 lbs. of beans would afford as much sustenance\r\nto an animal as 67 of pease, 100 of wheat-flour, or 177 _of rice_.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the value of this opinion, it will be proper\r\nto consider the several purposes which the food is destined to serve\r\nin the animal economy—what the animal must derive from its food to\r\nmaintain its existing condition, or to admit of a healthy increase of\r\nbulk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.—OF THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS, AND THE PURPOSES SERVED BY THE\r\nFOOD THEY CONSUME.\r\n\r\nThe food of plants we have seen to consist essentially of two kinds,\r\nthe _organic_ and the _inorganic_, both of which we have insisted upon\r\nas equally necessary to the living vegetable—equally indispensable to\r\nits healthy growth. A brief glance at the purposes served by plants in\r\nthe feeding of animals, will not only confirm this view, but will also\r\nthrow some additional light upon the _kind_ of inorganic food which the\r\nplants must be able to procure, in order that they may be fitted to\r\nfulfil their assigned purpose in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nMan, and all domestic animals, may be supported, may even be fattened,\r\nupon vegetable food alone: vegetables, therefore, must contain all\r\nthe substances which are necessary to build up the several parts of\r\nanimal bodies, and to supply the waste attendant upon the performance\r\nof the necessary functions of animal life. Let us consider what these\r\nsubstances are, and in what quantities they must be supplied to the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\n1. _The food must supply carbon for respiration._\r\n\r\nA man of sedentary habits, or whose occupation requires little bodily\r\nexertion, may respire about 5 ounces of carbon in twenty-four hours—one\r\nwho takes moderate exercise, about 8 ounces—and one who has to undergo\r\nviolent bodily exertion, from 12 to 15 ounces.\r\n\r\nIf we take the mean quantity of 8 ounces, then to supply this alone, a\r\nman must eat 18 ounces of starch or sugar every day. If he take it in\r\nthe form of wheaten bread, he will require 1¾ lbs. of bread, if in the\r\nform of potatoes, about 7½ lbs. of raw potatoes, to supply the waste\r\ncaused by his respiratory organs alone.\r\n\r\nWhen the habits are sedentary, 5 lbs. of potatoes may be sufficient,\r\nwhen violent and continued exercise is taken, 12 to 15 lbs. may be too\r\nlittle. At the same time, it must be observed, that where the supply is\r\nless, the quantity of carbonic acid given off will either be less also,\r\nor the deficiency will be supplied at the expense of the body itself.\r\nIn either case the strength will be impaired, and fresh food will be\r\nrequired to recruit the exhausted frame.\r\n\r\n2. _The food must repair the daily waste of the muscular parts of the\r\nbody._\r\n\r\nWhen the body is full grown, a portion from every part of it is\r\ndaily abstracted by natural processes, and rejected either in the\r\nperspiration or in the solid and fluid excrements. This portion must\r\nbe supplied by the food, or the strength will diminish—the frame will\r\ngradually waste away.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of animals, of which lean beef and mutton are examples,\r\nare generally coloured by blood, but when well washed with water, they\r\nbecome quite white, and, with the exception of a little fat, are found\r\nto consist of a white fibrous substance, to which the name of _fibrin_\r\nhas been given by chemists. The clot of the blood consists of the\r\nsame substance; while skin, hair, horn, and the organic part of the\r\nbones, are composed of varieties of _gelatine_. This latter substance\r\nis familiarly known in the form of _glue_, and though it differs in\r\nits sensible properties, it is remarkably analogous to _fibrin_ in its\r\nelementary constitution, as both of these substances are to the white\r\nof the egg (_albumen_), to the curd of milk (_casein_), and to the\r\n_gluten_ of flour. They all contain nitrogen, and all consist of the\r\nfour elementary bodies (organic elements), very nearly in the following\r\nproportions:—\r\n\r\n    Carbon,      55\r\n    Hydrogen,     7\r\n    Nitrogen,    18\r\n    Oxygen,      20\r\n               ----\r\n                100\r\n\r\nThey all contain, likewise, a small proportion of sulphur and of\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of one or other of these removed from the body in 24\r\nhours, either in the perspiration or in the excretions, amounts to\r\n_about five ounces_, containing 350 grains of nitrogen, and this waste\r\nat least must be made up by the gluten or fibrin of the food.\r\n\r\nIn the 1¾ lb. of wheaten bread we have supposed to be eaten to supply\r\ncarbon for respiration, there will be contained also about 3 ounces\r\nof gluten. Let the other 2 ounces be made up in beef, of which half a\r\npound contains 2 ounces of dry fibrin, and we have\r\n\r\n                               For respiration.      For waste of\r\n                                                      muscle, &c.\r\n    1¾ lbs. of bread yielding 18 oz. starch and 3 oz. of gluten.\r\n    8 oz. of beef yielding                      2 oz. of fibrin.\r\n    Total consumed by respiration,}                        } gluten or\r\n      and the ordinary waste,     } 18 oz. starch and 5 oz.}  fibrin.\r\n\r\nIf, again, the 7½ lbs. of potatoes be eaten, then in these are\r\ncontained about 2½ ounces of gluten or albumen, so that there remain 2½\r\nounces to be supplied by beef, eggs, milk, or cheese.\r\n\r\nThe reader, therefore, will understand why a diet which will keep up\r\nthe human strength is easiest compounded of a mixture of vegetable and\r\nanimal food. It is not merely that such a mixture is more agreeable\r\nto the palate, or even that it is absolutely necessary,—for, as\r\nalready observed, the strength may be fully maintained by vegetable\r\nfood alone;—it is, that without animal food in one form or another,\r\nso large a bulk of vegetable food must be consumed in order to supply\r\nthe requisite quantity of nitrogen in the form of gluten. Of ordinary\r\nwheaten bread alone, about 3 lbs. daily must be eaten to supply the\r\nnitrogen,[24] and there would then be a considerable waste of carbon\r\nin the form of starch, by which the stomach would be overloaded, and\r\nwhich, not being worked up by respiration, would pass off in the\r\nexcretions. The wants of the body would be equally supplied, and with\r\nmore ease, by 1¾ lbs. of bread and 4 ounces of cheese.\r\n\r\n[24] The flour being supposed to contain 15 per cent. of dry gluten, on\r\nwhich supposition all the above calculations are made.\r\n\r\nOf rice, again, no less than 4 lbs. daily would be required to impart\r\nto the system the required proportion of gluten; and it is a familiar\r\nobservation of those who have been in India and other countries, where\r\nrice is the usual food of the people, that the degree to which the\r\nnatives distend, and apparently overload their stomachs with this\r\ngrain, is quite extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe stomachs and other digestive apparatus of our domestic animals are\r\nof larger dimensions, and they are able, therefore, to contain with\r\nease as much vegetable food, of almost any wholesome variety, as will\r\nsupply them with the quantity of nitrogen they may require. Yet every\r\nfeeder of stock knows that the addition of a small portion of oil-cake,\r\na substance rich in nitrogen, will not only fatten an animal more\r\nspeedily, but will also save a large _bulk_ of other kinds of food.\r\n\r\n3. But the blood and other fluids of the body contain much _saline_\r\nmatter of various kinds, sulphates, muriates, phosphates, and other\r\nsaline compounds of potash, soda, lime, and magnesia. All these have\r\ntheir special functions to perform in the animal economy, and of each\r\nof them an undetermined quantity daily escapes from the body in the\r\nperspiration, in the urine, or in the solid excretions. This quantity,\r\ntherefore, must be daily restored by the food.\r\n\r\nNo precise experiments have yet been made with the view of determining\r\nhow much saline matter is daily excreted from the body of a healthy\r\nman, or in what proportions the different inorganic substances are\r\npresent in it; but it is satisfactorily ascertained, that without\r\na certain _sufficient_ supply, the animal will languish and decay,\r\neven though carbon and nitrogen in the form of starch and gluten be\r\nabundantly given to it. It is a wise and beautiful provision of nature,\r\ntherefore, that plants are so organized as to refuse to grow in a soil\r\nfrom which they cannot readily obtain a supply of soluble inorganic\r\nfood, since that saline matter which ministers first to their own wants\r\nis afterwards surrendered by them to the animals they are destined to\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nThus the dead earth and the living animal are but parts of the same\r\nsystem,—links in the same endless chain of natural existences,—the\r\nplant is the connecting bond by which they are tied together on the one\r\nhand,—the decaying animal matter which returns to the soil, connects\r\nthem on the other.\r\n\r\n4. The solid bones of the animal are supplied from the same original\r\nsource,—the vegetable food on which they live. The bones of the cow\r\ncontain 55 per cent. of phosphate of lime, of the sheep 70, of the\r\nhorse 67, of the calf 54, and of the pig 52 lbs., in every hundred of\r\ndry bone. All this must come from the vegetable food. Of the bone-earth\r\nalso, a portion,—perhaps a variable portion,—is every day rejected from\r\nthe animal; the food, therefore, must contain a daily supply, or that\r\nwhich passes off will be taken from the substance of the bones, and the\r\nanimal will become feeble.\r\n\r\nIt is kindly provided by nature, that a certain proportion of this\r\ningredient of bones is always associated with the gluten of plants\r\nin its various forms,—with the fibrin of animal muscle and with the\r\ncurd of milk. Hence, man, in using any of these latter along with his\r\nvegetable food, obtains from them, with comparative ease, the quantity\r\nof the earth of bones which is necessary to keep his system in repair;\r\nwhile those animals which live upon vegetables alone, extract all they\r\nrequire along with the gluten of the plants on which they feed.\r\n\r\nThe provision is very beautiful by which the young animal,—the muscle\r\nand bones of which are rapidly growing,—is supplied with a larger\r\nportion of nitrogenous food and of bone-earth, than are necessary to\r\nmaintain the healthy condition of the full grown animal. The milk of\r\nthe mother is the natural food from which its supplies are drawn.\r\nThe sugar of the milk supplies the comparatively small quantity of\r\ncarbon necessary for the respiration of the young animal; as it gets\r\nolder, the calf or young lamb crops green food for itself to supply\r\nan additional portion. The curd of the milk (_casein_) yields the\r\nmaterials of the growing muscles, and of the animal part of the\r\nbones,—while dissolved along with the curd in the liquid milk is the\r\nphosphate of lime, of which the earthy part of the bones is to be built\r\nup. A glance at the constitution of milk will shew us how copious the\r\nsupply of all these substances is,—how beautifully the constitution\r\nof the mother’s milk is adapted to the wants of her infant offspring.\r\nCow’s milk consists in 1000 parts by weight of—\r\n\r\n    Butter,                                   27    to    35\r\n    Cheesy matter (casein),                   45    to    90\r\n    Milk sugar,                               36    to    50\r\n\r\n    _Chloride of potassium_, and\r\n       a little chloride of sodium,            1½}\r\n    _Phosphates_, chiefly of _lime_,           2¼}  to    10\r\n\r\n    Other salts,                               6\r\n    Water,                                   882¼   to   815\r\n                                            -----       ----\r\n                                            1000        1000\r\n\r\nThe quality of the milk, and, consequently, the proportions of the\r\nseveral constituents above mentioned, vary with the breed of the\r\ncow,—with the food on which it is supported,—with the time that has\r\nelapsed since the period of calving,—with its age, its state of health,\r\nand with the warmth of the weather;[25] but in all cases this fluid\r\ncontains the same substances, though in different quantities.\r\n\r\n[25] In warm weather the milk contains more butter, in cold weather\r\nmore cheese and sugar.\r\n\r\nMilk of the quality above analyzed contains, in every ten gallons,\r\n4½ lbs. of casein, equal to the formation of 18 lbs. of ordinary\r\nmuscle, and 3½ ounces of phosphate of lime (bone-earth), equal to\r\nthe production of 7 ounces of dry bone. But from the casein have to\r\nbe formed the skin, the hair, the horn, the hoof, &c. as well as the\r\nmuscle, and in all these is contained also a minute portion of the\r\nbone-earth. A portion of all the ingredients of the milk likewise\r\npasses off in the ordinary excretions, and yet every one knows how\r\nrapidly young animals thrive, when allowed to consume the whole of the\r\nmilk which nature has provided as their most suitable nourishment.\r\n\r\nAnd whence does the mother derive all this gluten and bone-earth, by\r\nwhich she can not only repair the natural waste of her own full grown\r\nbody, but from which she can spare enough also to yield so large a\r\nsupply of nourishing milk? She must extract them from the vegetables on\r\nwhich she lives, and they again from the soil.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of solid matter thus yielded by the cow in her milk is\r\nreally very large, if we look at the produce of an entire year. If the\r\naverage yield of milk be 3000 quarts, or 750 gallons in a year—every 10\r\ngallons of which contain bone-earth enough to form about 7 ounces of\r\ndry bone—then the milking of the cow alone exhausts her of the earthy\r\ningredients of 33 lbs. of dry bone. And this she draws necessarily from\r\nthe soil!\r\n\r\nIf this milk be consumed on the spot, then all returns again to the\r\nsoil in the annual manuring of the land. Let it be carried for sale\r\nto a distance, or let it be converted into cheese and butter, and in\r\nthis form exported, there will then be a yearly drain upon the land\r\nof the materials of bones, from this cause alone, equal to 30 lbs. of\r\nbone-dust. After the lapse of centuries, it is conceivable that old\r\npasture lands in cheese and dairy countries should become poor in the\r\nmaterials of bones—and that in such districts, as now in Cheshire, the\r\napplication of bone-dust should entirely alter the character of the\r\ngrasses, and renovate the old pastures.\r\n\r\nThus, as was stated at the commencement of the present section the\r\nstudy of the nature, and functions of the food of animals throws\r\nadditional light upon the nature also and final uses of the food of\r\nplants. It even teaches us what to look for in the soil—what a fertile\r\nsoil _must_ contain that it may grow nourishing food—what we must add\r\nto the soil when chemical analysis fails to detect its actual presence,\r\nor when the food it produces is unable to supply all that the animal\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nThe principles above explained, therefore, shew that the value of any\r\nvegetable production, considered as the _sole_ food of an animal, is\r\nnot to be judged of—cannot, in short, be accurately determined—by\r\nthe amount it may contain of any _one_ of those substances, _all_ of\r\nwhich together are necessary to build up the growing body of the young\r\nanimal, and to repair the natural waste of such as have attained to\r\ntheir fullest size.\r\n\r\nHence the failure of the attempts that have been made to support the\r\nlives of animals by feeding them upon pure starch or sugar alone. These\r\nsubstances would supply carbon for respiration, but all the natural\r\nwaste of nitrogen, of saline matter, and of earthy phosphates, must\r\nhave been drawn from the existing solids and fluids of their living\r\nbodies. The animals in consequence pined away, and sooner or later died.\r\n\r\nSome have expressed surprise that animals have refused to thrive,\r\nand have ultimately died, when fed upon animal jelly or gelatine\r\n(from bones) alone, nourishing though that substance _as part of the\r\nfood_ undoubtedly is. When given in sufficient quantity, gelatine\r\nmight indeed supply carbon enough for respiration, with a great waste\r\nof nitrogen, but it is deficient in the saline ingredients which a\r\nnaturally nourishing food contains.\r\n\r\nEven on the natural mixture of starch and gluten in fine white bread,\r\ndogs have been unable to live beyond 50 days, though others fed on\r\nhousehold bread, containing a portion of the bran—in which earthy\r\nmatter more largely resides—continued to thrive long after. It is\r\nimmaterial whether the general quantity of the _whole_ food be reduced\r\ntoo low, or whether _one_ of its necessary ingredients only be too much\r\ndiminished or entirely withdrawn. In either case, the effect will be\r\nthe same—the animal will pine away, and sooner or later die.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.—OF THE PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL VALUE OF DIFFERENT KINDS\r\nOF FOOD.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in the preceding section, it appears,\r\nthat, for various reasons, different kinds of food are not equally\r\nnourishing. This fact is of great importance, not only in the\r\npreparation of human food, but also in the feeding of stock. It has,\r\ntherefore, been made the subject of experiment by many practical\r\nagriculturists, with the following general results.\r\n\r\nIf common hay be taken as the standard of comparison, then to yield\r\nthe same amount of nourishment with 10 lbs. of hay, a weight of the\r\nother kinds of food must be given, which is represented by the number\r\nopposite to each in the following table:—\r\n\r\n    Hay,              10            Carrots,          25  to  30\r\n    Clover hay,        8  to  10    Turnips,          50\r\n    Green clover,     45  to  50    Cabbage,          20  to  30\r\n    Wheat straw,      40  to  50    Pease and Beans,   3  to   5\r\n    Barley straw,     20  to  40    Wheat,             5  to   6\r\n    Oat straw,        20  to  40    Barley,            5  to   6\r\n    Pea straw,        10  to  15    Oats,              4  to   7\r\n    Potatoes,         20            Indian corn,       5\r\n    Old potatoes,     40?           Oil-cake,          2  to   4\r\n\r\nIt is found in practice, as the above table shews, that twenty stones\r\nof potatoes or three of oil-cake will nourish an animal as much as ten\r\nstones of hay, and five stones of oats as much as either. Something,\r\nhowever, will depend upon the quality of each kind of food, and upon\r\nthe age and constitution of the animal. The skilful feeder of stock\r\nknows also the value of a change of food, or of a mixture of the\r\ndifferent kinds of vegetable food he may have at his command.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive value of different kinds of food has also been\r\nrepresented theoretically, by supposing it to be very nearly in\r\nproportion to the quantity of nitrogen, or of gluten, which vegetables\r\ncontain. Though this cannot be considered as a correct principle,\r\nyet as the ordinary kind of food on which stock is fed contains in\r\ngeneral an ample supply of carbon for respiration, with a comparatively\r\nsmall proportion of nitrogen, these theoretical determinations are by\r\nno means without their value, and they approach in many cases very\r\nclosely to the practical values above given, as deduced from actual\r\ntrial. Thus, assuming that 10 lbs. of hay yield a certain amount\r\nof nourishment, then of the other vegetable substances it will be\r\nnecessary, according to theory, to give the following quantities, in\r\norder to produce the same effect:\r\n\r\n    Hay,              10    Turnips,          60\r\n    Clover hay,        8    Carrots,          35\r\n    Vetch hay,[26]     4    Cabbage,          30 to 40\r\n    Wheat straw,      52    Pease and Beans,   2 to  3\r\n    Barley straw,     52    Wheat,             5\r\n    Oat straw,        55    Barley,            6\r\n    Pea straw,         6    Oats,              5\r\n    Potatoes,         28    Indian corn,       6\r\n    Old potatoes,     40    Oil-cake,          2\r\n\r\n[26] Both cut in flower.\r\n\r\nIf the feeder be careful to supply his stock with a mixture or\r\noccasional change of food, he may very safely regulate the quantity of\r\nany one he ought to substitute for a given weight of any of the others,\r\nby the numbers in the above tables—since the theoretical and practical\r\nresults do not in general very greatly differ.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, it is not strictly correct that this or\r\nthat kind of vegetable is more fitted to sustain animal life, simply\r\nbecause of the larger proportion of nitrogen it contains; but it\r\nis wisely provided, that along with this nitrogen in all plants,\r\na certain proportion of starch or sugar and of saline and earthy\r\nmatter are always associated—so that the quantity of nitrogen may be\r\nconsidered as a rough practical index of the proportion of some of the\r\nimportant saline and earthy ingredients also.\r\n\r\nAn important practical lesson on this subject is taught us by the study\r\nof the wise provisions of Nature. Not only does the milk of the mother\r\ncontain all the elements of a nutritive food mixed up together—as the\r\negg does also for the unhatched bird—but in rich natural pastures the\r\nsame mixture uniformly occurs. Hence, in cropping the mixed herbage,\r\nthe animal introduces into its stomach portions of various plants—some\r\nabounding more in starch or sugar, some more in gluten or albumen, some\r\nnaturally richer in saline, others in earthy constituents; and out of\r\nthese varied materials the digestive organs select a due proportion of\r\neach, and reject the rest. Wherever a pasture becomes usurped by one or\r\ntwo grasses—either animals cease to thrive upon it, or they must crop a\r\nmuch larger quantity of food to supply the natural waste of _all_ the\r\nparts of their bodies.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be assumed as almost a general principle, that whenever\r\nanimals are fed on one kind of vegetable only, there is a waste of one\r\nor other of the necessary elements of animal food, and that the great\r\nlesson on this subject taught us by nature is, that, by a judicious\r\nadmixture, not only is food economised, but the labour imposed upon the\r\ndigestive organs is also materially diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.—CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn this little work, now brought to a close, I have presented the\r\nreader with a slight, and I hope plain and familiar, sketch of the\r\nvarious topics connected with practical agriculture, on which the\r\nsciences of chemistry and geology are fitted to throw the greatest\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWe have studied the general characters of the organic and inorganic\r\nelements of which the parts of plants are made up, and the several\r\ncompounds of these elements which are of the greatest importance in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom. We have examined the nature of the seed,—seen\r\nby what beautiful provision it is fed during its early germination—in\r\nwhat form the elements by which it is nourished are introduced into\r\nthe circulation of the young plant when the functions of the seed are\r\ndischarged,—and how earth, air, and water are all made to minister\r\nto its after-growth. We have considered the various chemical changes\r\nwhich take place within the growing plant, during the formation of its\r\nwoody stem, the blossoming of its flower, and the ripening of its seed\r\nor fruit,—and have traced the further changes it undergoes, when, the\r\nfunctions of its short life being discharged, it hastens to serve other\r\npurposes, by mingling with the soil, and supplying food to new races.\r\nThe soils themselves in which plants grow, their nature, their origin,\r\nthe causes of their diversity in mineral character, and in natural\r\nproductiveness, have each occupied a share of our attention—while\r\nthe various means of improving their agricultural value by manuring\r\nor otherwise, have been practically considered, and theoretically\r\nexplained. Lastly, we have glanced at the comparative worth of the\r\nvarious products of the land, as food for man or other animals, and\r\nhave briefly illustrated the principles upon which the feeding of\r\nanimals and the relative nutritive powers of the vegetables on which\r\nthey live are known to depend.\r\n\r\nIn this short and familiar treatise I have not sought so much to\r\n_satisfy_ the demands of the philosophical agriculturist, as to\r\n_awaken_ the curiosity of my less instructed reader, to shew him how\r\nmuch interesting as well as practically useful information chemistry\r\nand geology are able and willing to impart to him, and thus to allure\r\nhim in quest of further knowledge and more accurate details to my\r\nlarger work,[27] of which the present exhibits only a brief outline.\r\n\r\n[27] LECTURES _on Agricultural Chemistry and Geology_.\r\n\r\nJ.
