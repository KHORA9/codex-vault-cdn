I. PHILADELPHIA, _Eighth Month, 1820_. _No. 8._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRIEND OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE TO ITS READERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in which the honourable fame and steady prosperity\r\nof our country, and the best interests of its inhabitants, are more\r\ndeeply involved, than in _the promotion of agriculture_. With one\r\nhundred and twenty millions of acres of _cleared_, or _natural,\r\nstrong, unwooded_ land, and a population computed at nine millions\r\nof persons, we have more soil already prepared for plantations,\r\nfarms and grazing, in proportion to our numbers, than any other\r\ncivilized people; and our capacities to add to our quantity of\r\ncleared or unwooded land, extend to ten times the number of acres.\r\nFrom the productions of these lands have our former happiness and\r\nwealth arisen, and from the commerce and fabrication of these\r\nproductions, have our foreign and domestic trade, and all our home\r\nmanufactures, worth above two hundred millions of dollars, sprung\r\nup. The merchants and manufacturers actually hold so real and great\r\na competition for the natural and agricultural productions of the\r\nland, that none of these productions, capable of manufacture, were\r\nexported even in the last year, except _cotton_, in the manufacture\r\nof which we had made very great progress, in 1810; even without the\r\ndouble and war duties, or those existing at this time. They were\r\nsupposed to be worth 15,000,000 of dollars in that year. The present\r\ncrisis, when all nations are revising and improving their systems of\r\nagriculture, commerce and manufactures, appears to be a fit season\r\nfor increased attention, consideration and exertion on our part;\r\nand first in the culture of the soil. It is proposed, as a suitable\r\nobject for such a work as _The Rural Magazine_, to make some of\r\nthose exertions in relation to _agriculture and the connected\r\nsubjects_, which are often demanded by those strong tides in human\r\nlife, which are dispensed to us in the course of divine Providence.\r\nPennsylvania, and the five other states which are contiguous to her,\r\nmaking six in their whole number, contain about one hundred and\r\nforty millions of acres of land in the most temperate and genial\r\n_farming_ climates of our country. The southern parts of that noble\r\nfarming district even favours the cotton, the vine and the fig tree;\r\nand every species of production, requiring the tone of the northern\r\npart of the temperate zone for its growth or the fabrication of\r\nthose productions, is adapted to the higher latitudes of that\r\nregion of our country. The best culture of the eastern states is\r\ncomprehended in the proper farming of that district. The effectual\r\nbearing of the productions of the south upon the profits of the\r\nfarming of the middle, northern and eastern states, will always\r\nrender the actual or new culture of our great southern district of\r\nsugar, rice, indigo, cotton and grape vines, deeply important us;\r\nbecause the cultivation of those and other productions, adapted to\r\ntheir climates, will prevent their attention, as principal objects,\r\nto those things which must always be produced by our cattle, grass,\r\napple, vegetable and grain farms. The cider and apple brandy, for\r\nexample, of the county of _Morris_, in New Jersey, which far exceeds\r\nthe general belief, the superfine flour of the white wheat country\r\nof this middle district, and the fabrications of the dairy of the\r\neastern states, sustain no interference at home or abroad, from\r\nthe productions of those southern labourers who are employed on\r\nsugar, rice, cotton, indigo and tobacco; or may be employed on the\r\nfruit of the grape vine, the olive tree and their fabrications,\r\nwhich annually yield to France one hundred and twenty millions of\r\ndollars. The culture of the southern states is, therefore, in truth,\r\na fit subject of attention and solicitude for the Pennsylvanians,\r\nand their surrounding northern and eastern brethren; and valuable\r\npapers on that subject would always deserve a place in _The Rural\r\nMagazine_. If the African TERENCE has been quoted, beyond any other\r\nwriter, for the beautiful exclamation of one of his personified\r\ncharacters, \"_Homo_ sum, et nihil humani a me alienum puto,\"[1] how\r\nimpossible is it for a true and faithful member of this favoured\r\nnation to forget to exclaim, \"_Americanus_ sum, et nihil _Americani_\r\na me alienum puto.\"[2]\r\n\r\n  [1] I am a _man_, and I consider nothing that affects _man_ as\r\n  foreign to me.\r\n\r\n  [2] I am an _American_, and I consider nothing that affects\r\n  _America_ as foreign to me.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important practices of agriculture belong to\r\nall our climates. _Irrigation_, beautiful, elegant, profitable\r\n_irrigation_, or the watering of grounds, by turning upon them\r\nstreams that have been wont to run waste, and pour their unused\r\nvegetative powers into navigable rivers, is a great example. The\r\nvenerable and judicious ARTHUR YOUNG wrote to his compatriots\r\nin England, from the districts of Piedmont and Milan, the best\r\nirrigated parts of _the valley of the Po_, that such was the\r\nperfection of that branch of agriculture and the connected branches\r\nof working and neat cattle, dairies, rice, &c. that, excellent as\r\nwas their English system in his vicinity, his friends could have no\r\nconception of perfection in farming, without visiting that part of\r\nupper Italy. The orange trees are carefully irrigated in the kingdom\r\nof Portugal, as are the vines of Madeira, and the rice in those\r\nof our southern states which produce that wholesome, valuable and\r\ndelightful grain.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, in every section of our country, keep attention on\r\nthe stretch _to improve our whole landed interest_, which, like our\r\ngreat internal seas, our heaven dispensed lakes, is the natural\r\nhead, from which the sister streams of _commerce and manufactures_\r\nare, unforcedly, to flow, and run till the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\n     Travel in the younger sort is a part of education; in the elder\r\n     a part of experience.\r\n\r\n  _Bacon._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the plan proposed in the initial number of these\r\npapers, which, although a mortifying consideration to the pride\r\nof authorship, it is quite probable many of my readers have\r\nalready forgotten; I shall, on the present occasion, avail myself\r\nof one of the sources of instruction and gratification there\r\nindicated--foreign travel. The friend to whom I am indebted for the\r\nfollowing remarkable incidents, illustrative of the present state\r\nof morals in Italy, has not long since returned from a tour through\r\nEngland, France, Italy, Switzerland, and part of Germany; with\r\nan increased attachment for his native country and her admirable\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nHe left Milan for Florence, passing through the towns of Lodi,\r\nPlazenza, Parma, and Bologna, where he arrived after eight days\r\njourneying. Among the passengers in the coach with him, was a young\r\ngentleman of Rome, the Cavaliere V----, who was returning home after\r\na two years tour in _South_ America and Europe. Between these two,\r\nas those who are strangers in any part of the world, particularly\r\nwhen travelling together, experience a community of privation and\r\nenjoyment, an intimacy was soon formed. The distance from Florence\r\nto Rome is 193 English miles. The road passes over the Appenine\r\nmountains, and by the tardy mode of travelling peculiar to the\r\ncountry, there being no public coaches, it requires six days. The\r\nhighways in this neighbourhood are infested with banditti of the\r\nmost ferocious character, and almost every day furnishes accounts\r\nof robberies and murders. On the 5th of January, 1819, they left\r\nFlorence. The first three days were marked by no striking incident,\r\nbut on the morning of the fourth, about dawn, their ears were\r\naccosted with a sudden discharge of fire-arms close to the carriage,\r\nwhich they soon found to proceed from the carbines of banditti.\r\nPreviously to quitting Milan, our friend had taken the precaution to\r\ndivide his gold, carrying part of it about his person, enveloped in\r\na bandana handkerchief in the form of a belt, and the remainder in\r\na portmanteau. He had also a number of Bank of England notes, which\r\nhe carried in his pocket-book, with his passport, &c. The bandana\r\nsoon attracted their attention, and its contents, 30 Napoleons, with\r\nhis purse, &c. fell into their hands. His portmanteau being securely\r\nlashed to the imperial, escaped the plunderers, as well as his watch\r\nand pocket-book. It was within a league of Montifiascone where the\r\nattack was made. The robbers were interrupted in the height of their\r\nvillainy, by the tramp of approaching horses, which proved to be the\r\nneighbouring peasantry commencing their daily toils; and retreated\r\nwith precipitation to the impenetrable thickets of the Appenines.\r\nThe travellers then proceeded on their journey to Rome, without\r\nexperiencing further molestation.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival there, our countryman congratulated himself on his\r\ngood fortune in having become acquainted with the Cavaliere V----,\r\nwhose politeness and attentions were particularly grateful; and\r\nas Rome was the place of his residence, every object of interest\r\nand curiosity to be found there, was perfectly familiar to him. He\r\nintroduced his American acquaintance to his father, who was a man of\r\nrank, living in splendour and opulence; and to his sisters, whose\r\nsociety the latter felt every disposition to cultivate. Thus various\r\ncircumstances appeared to combine to render pleasant a residence in\r\nthis celebrated metropolis, and to aid him in his contemplations\r\namong the remaining monuments of her former magnificence and power.\r\n\r\nOne morning having a leisure hour on his hands, our townsmen was\r\nengaged in his chamber counting his money, in order to ascertain the\r\nextent of his loss, sustained by the unwelcome visiters who had paid\r\nhim their respects on the road; when the Cavaliere unceremoniously\r\nentered the room, and seeing a pocket-book in his hand, immediately\r\ninquired what he had lost. The fact was, that a 20 pound note of\r\nthe Bank of England was missing, and as the pocket-book in which\r\nthe notes were contained, was not discovered by the banditti, in\r\ntheir haste to make their escape, he concluded that it had been\r\ncarelessly dropped at some time or other, and would never again be\r\nheard of; which he stated at once to his pseudo friend. The latter\r\nexpressed some surprise, and evinced considerable embarrassment\r\non the occasion. His quondam fellow tourist, however, made light\r\nof the matter, and endeavoured to change the conversation by\r\nstating, that he would ask the advice of his banker the duke of\r\nTorlonia, fortunately the only house in the habit of discounting\r\nEnglish notes; and would also write to his banker in London, to\r\nhave the payment stopped at the Bank of England. To this plan the\r\nCavaliere strenuously objected, but said, that he knew a man in\r\nRome, who would procure him the note if it was to be found; and in\r\nconsequence of this suggestion, the application to the Duke was\r\nnot made. Our traveller, reflecting on the circumstances connected\r\nwith this interview, his being interrogated as to his loss before\r\nany intimation had been given that such loss had been sustained,\r\nthe hurried and peculiar manner in which the inquiries were made,\r\nin addition to the fact that the Cavaliere was the only person\r\nwho had seen them counted, and that he was careless of locking up\r\nhis pocket-book, began to suspect, although his rank and standing\r\nmight forbid it, that the gentleman knew something about the note.\r\nAs the numbers of the different bills had been taken, there could\r\nnot readily have been a mistake. A few days subsequently it was\r\ndistinctly intimated, that the person to whom application had been\r\nmade, knew where the note was. An interview with the _conjurer_ was\r\nzealously urged, in the hope of visiting the thief with merited\r\npunishment. To this the Cavaliere replied, that he had pledged his\r\nhonour that the affair should remain in profound secrecy, and that\r\nhe would himself be responsible for the payment, and accordingly\r\ngave his note of hand for it payable in two days! After _many_\r\ndays had elapsed without receiving the amount, the patience of\r\nour traveller was nearly exhausted, and under the influence of\r\nirritation, produced by the unprincipled conduct of this modern\r\nRoman, it was determined to disclose the whole transaction to his\r\nfather. The subject was introduced with the utmost delicacy. The old\r\ngentleman, after hearing a detail of all the circumstances, coolly\r\nobserved, that it was no business of his, and that his son would\r\ndoubtless attend to it. He was then explicitly told, that respect\r\nfor his supposed parental feelings had induced the reserve which he\r\nhad witnessed; but as this reserve, it was perfectly apparent, was\r\naltogether unnecessary, the facts of the case should be made known,\r\nand the moral turpitude of his son publicly exposed.--The expression\r\nof this determination caused an immediate change of tone and manner;\r\nhe was now all sensibility to the reputation of his son and that\r\nof his family, and gave a positive assurance that the money should\r\nbe immediately forthcoming. Shortly after this conversation it was\r\nbrought by his quondam friend, and was principally in various gold\r\ncoins, which had probably been procured for him by a broker, on the\r\nlowest terms.\r\n\r\nThe family, in which our countryman resided, while at Rome, was\r\nhighly agreeable; and the society of the lady, and her amiable\r\ndaughters, was a source of pleasure to the gentlemen who lived\r\nin the house. On the evening of the day on which this affair was\r\nsettled, he had taken his wonted seat in this interesting circle,\r\nwhich so delightfully reminded him of that which he had left at\r\nhome, when the brother of the Cavaliere, who was invested with\r\nsome office of dignity, entered in full dress. He very courteously\r\nand gracefully paid his respects to all the individuals composing\r\nthe company, with the exception of the American, of whom,\r\nnotwithstanding his being well acquainted with him, he took no\r\nnotice whatever. He then intimated to the lady of the house, that\r\nhe wished to speak with her in private. She accordingly withdrew,\r\nand very soon afterwards returned, and informed our tourist, that\r\nthe gentleman desired to see him in the adjoining room. On entering,\r\nhe was charged with attempting to sully the character of a family,\r\nwhich could trace its reputation and fame through a long line of\r\nnoble ancestry; and that for this injustice, instant reparation\r\nshould be made. He then drew his sword in a tempest of passion,\r\nbut recollecting immediately, that his antagonist was unarmed, he\r\nsheathed it, and drew from his pocket a pair of pistols, with which\r\nhe insisted they should fight without delay. By this time one of\r\nthe party, alarmed by the noise occasioned by their altercation,\r\nhurried into the room, and on learning the cause which produced it,\r\ngave such explanations to the enraged Italian as were acknowledged\r\nto be perfectly satisfactory, as to the treatment his brother had\r\nreceived; and with a smile, which he could assume at pleasure,\r\nhe took his leave. After his departure, the lady took occasion to\r\ncaution our traveller against venturing out during the evening,\r\nassigning as a reason for this advice, that the officer was very\r\nvindictive in his disposition, and that an Englishman, who had not\r\nlong previously given him some offence, lost his life in consequence\r\nof the attack of an assassin. This admonition was not disregarded.\r\nIn the course of the evening, a member of the family, who had heard\r\nnothing of the previous occurrences, on his return home, observed,\r\nthat he could not conceive what mischief was in agitation, as his\r\nface had been closely examined by more than one person, in passing\r\nthe lamps, who wore masks, and appeared to be actuated by curiosity,\r\nor some other motive, to an extraordinary degree. Those who were\r\nacquainted with the events of the evening, were at no loss to\r\nconjecture for whom they were on the watch. An obnoxious individual\r\ncan at any time be put out of the way, in Rome, for a very small\r\nreward. To save these obliging and tender-hearted gentry further\r\ntrouble, and to consult his own safety, he early the next morning\r\nleft the dominions of the church, and pursued his journey to Naples.\r\n\r\nIf individuals, and incidents of such a character, should frequently\r\npresent themselves to the notice of the tourist, it would almost\r\ninduce him to deny himself the delights and advantages of foreign\r\ntravel, and adopt this sentiment of COWLEY,\r\n\r\n    _About the spacious world let others roam,\r\n    The voyage life, is longest made at home._\r\n                                               ☞\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwice in every year our otherwise quiet village is thrown into a\r\nferment, which agitates its little community like an earthquake,\r\nand unsettles all the habits of order and industry for which we are\r\nusually remarkable. The cause of this great tumult is the militia\r\ntraining--that system which supposes every citizen to be a soldier,\r\nand undertakes to instruct him in the art and mystery of holding a\r\nmusket and putting the right foot foremost. On the last of these\r\noccasions, I was surprised to find that my whole school had played\r\ntruant; and observing an unusual ferment in the streets, found,\r\nupon inquiry, that at the last election for officer, Ezekiel Snip,\r\nthe village tailor, a man with fierce red whiskers and a peculiar\r\naltitude of chin, had been elected captain. Ezekiel had dipt into\r\nDuane's Hand-Book, and was esteemed profoundly skilled in the\r\nmanual exercise; so that the neighbours were all on the tiptoe of\r\nexpectation to witness the parade of the day. As this took place\r\nopposite to my school-room, I seated myself quietly at the window\r\nto watch how matters proceeded. About eight o'clock, the tavern\r\nporch began to be filled with people, some bringing old rusty\r\nrifles, others their fowling pieces, and some armed with a stout\r\noaken stick. Then sallied forth a valiant drummer, aided by a no\r\nless valiant fifer, at the head of some dozens of the town boys,\r\nto alarm the village. They marched up the street, and down the\r\nstreet, and beat tantarara, and whistled out of all tune,--till my\r\nhead ached,--to the infinite delight of the idle urchins at their\r\nheels, and the gaping housemaids at the doors and windows, as they\r\npassed. When this preparatory ceremony was gone through, forth\r\nissued captain Snip from the tavern door, in all the glory of a blue\r\ncoat, epaulettes, a sword and feather. The militia-men were then\r\nranged out in ranks, and the muster-roll called. I was particularly\r\nstruck with the assemblage present. I looked in vain for the most\r\nrespectable of our mechanics and neighbouring farmers.--The ranks\r\nwere chiefly filled with the idle young men of the village and the\r\ntavern frequenters of the neighbourhood; in short, with men who\r\nhung loose upon society, and were eager for every adventure that\r\nwould enable them to get through a day, without work, and might\r\nend in a drinking match. Captain Snip bustled about with becoming\r\nself-importance,--fixed this man six inches back, and that one\r\nas much forward, and having thus ranged them _a la militaire_,\r\nproceeded, by the aid of his Hand-Book, to induct them into the\r\nmanual exercise. At the word \"Shoulder fire-locks,\" a scene of\r\nconfusion ensued. Some had their pieces on the right and some\r\non the left shoulder, and they were ranged at all angles from a\r\nperpendicular to a horizontal line.--With infinite difficulty, and\r\nafter repeated trials, the captain got them to order and proceeded\r\nto the next command. As he went on I observed that he became\r\nimpatient and confused; the disorder into which his company were\r\ncontinually getting, surpassed his abilities to rectify, and his\r\nlimited and superficial knowledge began to fail him. He quite lost\r\nhis authority over his men; but by dint of storming, succeeded\r\nat last in getting some how through the business. The drum then\r\nsounded, and the gallant troop marched out to the commons, there to\r\nencamp for the day, carrying in their train all the noisy and idle\r\nboys of the town.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they again made their appearance, dusty, fatigued,\r\nand disorderly, and after a sham exercise in the street, were\r\ndismissed. It was a glorious day for the sellers of cakes, and\r\nbeer, and brandy, and whiskey. Many a bottle that day was emptied\r\nof its fiery contents, and many a miserable wretch strengthened in\r\nthe habits of vice and dissipation. Scarce a man of this valiant\r\ncorps returned home sober. The tavern door was a scene of continued\r\nquarrelling and the most shocking profanity, till eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nBattle succeeded battle, to the infinite diversion of the\r\nby-standers, and to the edification and instruction of the lads of\r\nall sizes that were thronging to this school of morality. I know not\r\nhow captain Snip felt upon descending to his ordinary employment,\r\nfrom such a height of military glory, but I myself have been sad and\r\nmelancholy ever since, when I reflected upon the events of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd what, fellow citizens, is the great good attained by these\r\nmilitia trainings? It is the idlest of idle dreams to suppose\r\nthe recurrence, four times in the year, of such scenes as I have\r\ndescribed, can make soldiers of our yeomanry. It may make idlers,\r\nit may make bullies, and drunkards, and gamblers of them; but what\r\nthey learn of military discipline, of the subordination of a camp,\r\nis not worth a farthing candle. You lose to the state the labour of\r\na hundred thousand men, that they may be placed under the tuition\r\nof some half-learned captain, who, perhaps, has never been in a\r\ncamp, and who does not, in the course of years, teach them more than\r\nthey could at any time learn as well and better in half a day's\r\nreal service. The good done to the state by these militia laws is\r\na mere shadow, and the wounds which they inflict upon the steady\r\nhabits, the industry and the morality of the country, are awful and\r\nportentous. I believe I do not exceed probability in asserting, that\r\none half of the drunkenness in the state, is induced or confirmed at\r\nthese militia trainings.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the effects upon those who obey the mandate\r\nof the law, that this system is to be deprecated. Look at it,\r\nin what light you will, it is injurious and oppressive. A large\r\nportion of your fellow citizens are men who will not, in any cause,\r\ntake the life or connive at the death of a fellow creature. They\r\nbelieve that the great Author of being retains in his own hand the\r\npower over life, and that it is impious in mortals to assume his\r\nprerogative.--No matter how true or false this may be, it is with\r\nthem an article of religious faith, and as such is held sacred by\r\nour constitution. Whatever law interferes with this article of\r\ntheir belief is, to them, persecution. If man has no moral right\r\nto take the life of his fellow, government can have no moral right\r\nto oblige him to do it; and they who obey the law, in preference\r\nto their conscience, are traitors to their God. If they obey your\r\nmilitary requisition, they become a party to a system altogether\r\nat variance with their faith. They cannot pay the fines which you\r\nimpose for their refusal, for you demand them as an equivalent for\r\nwhat they cannot concede to you. Here then are they placed, without\r\n(according to their belief) the power of moving. If you insist upon\r\nthe payment, you must despoil them of their goods. It is to be sure\r\nalleged, that the state cannot, with a due regard to its own safety,\r\ndispense with the military allegiance of its citizens. Admit this\r\nto be the case. Do you, in abstaining from the petty, alienating\r\nvexations of a militia law in time of peace, yield or forego the\r\nclaim to this allegiance? You pass an edict oppressive to a class\r\nof citizens, whose motive for non-compliance is sacred in the eye\r\nof the constitution,--an edict, which your experience of the past\r\nassures you, they will not comply with, and you create, in order\r\nto enforce it, a race of harpies, who are trained under it in all\r\nthe arts of oppression and plunder. And to what good end? Does one\r\nsolitary dollar of these militia exactions pass into your treasury?\r\nIs it not, on the contrary, a well known fact, that after seizing\r\nupon twice or thrice the just amount of the claim, the proceeds\r\nof the sale of these goods melt away before they reach the public\r\ntreasury? The ostensible object of the law is to train the yeomenry\r\nin the art of war. My word for it, its actual operation is more\r\nto enervate than to strengthen, and while it forms a dark blot on\r\nthe escutcheon of our state, there is not, in its consequences, a\r\nsingle salutary effect to compensate for the hardships it inflicts\r\nupon the followers of the great statesman, who laid the foundations\r\nof our public and private prosperity, our liberal institutions; of\r\nall, in short, which has rendered Pennsylvania the boast and the\r\nenvy of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nROUTE TO NIAGARA PALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editors._--During the continuance of the fervid season, some\r\nof your readers will probably beguile the tedium of mid-summer, by\r\ntaking excursions in various directions, as health or curiosity may\r\nhappen to invite them. The gratification to be derived from pursuing\r\nthe route to NIAGARA FALLS, and thence to Montreal and Quebec, will\r\namply repay all its fatigues, and realise the expectations of the\r\ntourist however highly excited.

E.\r\n\r\n     _A remarkable instance of premonition of impending death._\r\n\r\n\r\nYour readers may rely on the authenticity of what follows, as I\r\nassure them I copied it myself from the original letter in the well\r\nknown hand writing of John Ross, Esq. deceased, who was an eminent\r\nattorney at law in this city, for many years before the American\r\nrevolution, and also a member of the legislature, as a number still\r\nliving can remember. The letter was addressed to his friend Dr.\r\nCadwalader Evans, of this city, but then settled for a few years in\r\nthe Island of Jamaica. The accident happened to John Kinsey, Jun. He\r\nwas the son of John Kinsey, Esq., one of the most eminent lawyers\r\nof his time, also speaker of the Assembly and chief justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR DR. EVANS,\r\n\r\nI am going for Newcastle, early in the morning. I just heard of a\r\nvessel going to Jamaica before my return; so in haste determine to\r\ngive you one scrawl, lest you should think the neighbourhood forget\r\nyou. But you may depend that will never happen: we gratefully and\r\ncordially remember you often. I would tell you all the news in a\r\nword, if possible, with all haste. To begin--our neighbourhood\r\njust as you left us, only B. Franklin lives in your house. The\r\nCol. Hellier not yet gone to sea. I think all your acquaintance\r\ncontinue well, save poor Johnny Kinsey, jun. on Tuesday, the 8th\r\ninst. by accident shot himself dead, coming over Gray's ferry, by\r\nSchuylkill falls, while in the boat. He had loaded his gun, and, as\r\nis supposed, let the butt drop on the bottom of the flat, the gun\r\nin a line with his body by his side; went off when half cocked. The\r\nwhole load of shot struck his left cheek, and went up directly into\r\nhis brain. He dropped and was dead in an instant--never groaned.\r\nGreat sorrow attended his father, and all his friends, for the\r\naccident. He had strange apparitions of his death the night before,\r\nwhich he informed his aunt Bowene of at breakfast, the morning of\r\nthe accident. I must relate to you the particulars which are as true\r\nas surprising. He, talking with his aunt at breakfast concerning\r\nhis being admitted as an attorney and going into business, said,\r\nhe believed he had nothing to do with business, for his time, he\r\nthought, was not long in this world. He said that last night he\r\nwas strangely disturbed in his sleep with dreams and apparitions;\r\nthat his cousin Charles Pemberton, who died last spring, appeared\r\nto him, wrapped in a sheet, and said to him, \"Kinsey, your time\r\napproaches, you must go with me,\" and he disappeared. Soon after,\r\nappeared a person before him in the form of an angel, (according\r\nto the idea he had of an angel) and said to him \"Kinsey, your hour\r\nis come, you must go with me,\" and instantly he thought a flash of\r\nlightning struck him on the cheek and he instantly died. This was\r\nfollowed by a severe clap of thunder and lightning that awaked him\r\nfrom his sleep, and all those particulars came fresh to his memory,\r\nand gave him a great uneasiness. (Note--no thunder or lightning that\r\nnight.)--Upon this he endeavoured to get asleep again, and after\r\ndozing a short time, he was awaked by the noise of a person walking\r\nacross the room, giving a heavy groan. He heard or saw no more, but\r\ngot out of bed and went into the other room, called the Scotch boy\r\nto bring in his bed and lay by him the remainder of the night. In\r\nthe morning, at breakfast, on Tuesday last, he communicated all the\r\nbefore related to his aunt Bowene and Hannah Kearney. He seemed much\r\ndejected upon it, was confident he was near his end; but to divert\r\nhimself for that day, he determined to take his gun and go fowling\r\nwith young J. Derborow, young Oxley, and two or three more. They\r\nwalked to Coultas' ferry and crossed Schuylkill, and up to the falls\r\nferry. He told the company several times, as they walked, he wished\r\nno accident might befall him before he got home. On their return,\r\ncrossing the ferry in the boat, the unhappy accident happened him.\r\nThus you have the particulars of this melancholy affair, as fully\r\nas I could relate it if with you, and I chose to be particular in\r\nit, because I have met with no story in history so well attested as\r\nthis concerning the premonitions from heaven of our dissolution.\r\nThe flash that struck his cheek when asleep, was clearly answered\r\nby the flash of the gun and the shot thereof first striking. His\r\naunt laboured to persuade him not to go a gunning that day, and he\r\nagreed; but afterwards meeting his company, they prevailed with him,\r\nas they had all agreed to go the night before.\r\n\r\nYour father and all friends are well. I sincerely wish you all\r\nimaginable felicity, and with all the haste I began, I cannot help\r\nnow concluding that I am your very affectionate friend and humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n  JOHN ROSS.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Cadwalader Evans, St. Anns, Jamaica.\r\n\r\n  _Philad. Sunday Evening_, }\r\n  _13 Nov. 1748._           }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nFIRMITY AND HOMINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ancient very wholesome and pleasant dishes, which are\r\nmuch used in the states south of Pennsylvania, to which the middle\r\nand northern states have not yet paid sufficient attention. The\r\nfirst called FIRMITY, is made of WHEAT. The second, called HOMINY,\r\nis made of INDIAN CORN, or MAIZE. The grains of wheat and Indian\r\ncorn are prepared by beating in the same manner in a wooden mortar,\r\nwith an iron pestle, filed in crosses or ridges at the bottom, like\r\na modern stamp or seal for letters.\r\n\r\nTo make the firmity mortar, or hominy mortar, select a tree of from\r\ntwo feet to two feet and one half in diameter. Cut off a length (or\r\npiece as nearly as possible cylindrical) of about the height of a\r\nman's waistband from the ground. Let an iron hoop be well secured\r\non and around each of the ends, to bind and keep the wood together.\r\nThen make a hole at each end of this cut of wood, like the cavity\r\nof a common mortar, as wide as the wood will admit, at top, and\r\nnarrowing to a blunt point at the bottom. Both cavities are to be\r\nmade alike, so that in fact, in the one cylindrical piece of wood,\r\nthere will be two mortars; one in and at each end. These may be\r\nused indiscriminately for wheat or firmity, or for Indian corn or\r\nhominy, and will occasion the utensil to last longer.--It will be\r\nproper not to have the bottoms of the two mortars, or mortar holes,\r\nso deep as to endanger the driving a hole from one into the other,\r\nwhich would destroy the use of both. When the mortar is thus well\r\nmade, a moderate quantity of wheat, to make firmity, is to be put\r\ninto the mortar, in the upper part, as it stands on the end, and the\r\ngrain is to be moistened with a little warm water, to make the skin\r\nor bran come off easily and perfectly, by the beating. The pestle\r\nis then to be used by a man so as, by striking in among the grains\r\nof wheat, from the top to the bottom of the parcel, from time to\r\ntime, and repeatedly, to skin the grains of wheat, which it will do\r\neffectually. When this is done, the grains are to be separated from\r\nthe hulls or bran, by a sieve large enough to let the wheat through\r\nand keep out the bran or skin. When this has been done, the parcel\r\nis spread to dry, on a clean coarse linen or cotton cloth. The\r\nproper quantity is put into a large family pot, with a sufficient\r\nquantity of water to boil it, and to be evaporated by a steady\r\nsimmering heat from 8 or 9 in the evening till 9 or 10 next morning.\r\nThus the firmity will be made into a large mass of white mixture of\r\npaste or pulp of wheat, and of whole wheat. This is to be taken out\r\nin portions, as wanted to make a mess, boiled with skim or common\r\nmilk, as thick as pea-soup or rice-milk, and sweetened to the taste.\r\nA small lump of butter, of the size of a nutmeg, is often put into\r\nthe tureen or soup-dish of firmity, at the moment when it is served\r\nup hot. Some use a little nutmeg and a very little salt. Firmity\r\nis used after the meat meal, which need be but small when there is\r\nfirmity for dinner, for it is a very hearty and pleasant food. At\r\nsupper there is no occasion for meat.\r\n\r\nHominy is prepared in like manner, except that it is served up\r\nwithout milk, and that it is diluted moderately with hot water. A\r\nlittle butter and salt may be added; and on following days hominy\r\nis often fried in a large cake to the size of the pan.--Hominy, in\r\nevery form and state, is very good with the gravy of roasted beef,\r\nmutton, lamb, and poultry, steaks, chops, and cutlets.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, that wheat and Indian corn are much more wholesome\r\nin firmity and hominy, than in bread or _pone_. No yeast is\r\nrequired.--Great quantities of grain might be used in this way.\r\nEvery thing that employs our grain, which is becoming redundant, is\r\nan object worthy of consideration and attention. A great number of\r\nthe best living and most expensive families in Philadelphia, from\r\nMaryland, Delaware, and Virginia, use hominy and firmity with the\r\ngreatest relish; and if suitable mortars were sent thither for sale,\r\nthe use of this food would increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeeds, and larger growths, which interfere with cultivation or\r\nimpoverish the ground, should be cut down or pulled up, _before the\r\nseed ripens_, in August, which prevents their growing in a following\r\nyear. Weeds are the successful rivals of grain, garden vegetables,\r\nand grass.\r\n\r\nNow is the BUILDING season. All our country houses and places\r\nfor work, should be built on the south and west sides of swamps,\r\nmarshes, ponds, and other fresh waters, _on account of health_; and\r\nnot on the north or east sides of any such wet or watery places. The\r\nsummer winds blow from the south and west, and carry the unwholesome\r\nvapours, exhaled from those fresh waters, from places on their south\r\nand west sides, to places on the north and east sides, preserving\r\nthe people's health.\r\n\r\nWHITE COVERS of linen, cotton, or even paper, to the hats of people\r\nworking in the fields, fishing, fowling, travelling, &c. protect\r\nthem from morbid or sickening strokes of the sun. This is an old\r\npractice among the judicious Swiss.\r\n\r\nNow, when all the waters are becoming low, we should observe the\r\nplaces for tapping swamps, marshes, and ponds. By cutting a drain to\r\ndraw off the water in its low state, in August, we begin to reclaim\r\nour lands from the marsh and swamp.--The ground becomes firmer to\r\nhaul off the wood and timber in the cutting season. Wet grounds\r\nshould be drained, before they are cleared of their wood. For, if\r\nthey are freed from trees, _in their wet state_, the sun produces\r\nsickening and often fatal evaporations. This is true in France,\r\nGermany, Holland, and the marshy parts of England, though several\r\ndegrees further north than the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Dry Rot._--This destructive enemy of building, which generally\r\ncommences its ravages in the cellars, may be prevented or checked,\r\nby whitewashing them yearly, mixing copperas with it to give it a\r\nyellow hue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunicated for the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\nABSTRACTS\r\n\r\n     From the IVth volume of the Memoirs of the Philadelphia\r\n     Agricultural Society; Richard Peters, President; Wm.

See\r\nArchives of Useful Knowledge, by Dr. Mease; Encyclopædia Britanica;\r\nAccounts of East India Agriculture, &c. It is planted in the end of\r\nApril and gathered in the end of September, in 32° N. lat.; raised\r\nalso in 34° 50' N. lat. The oil is fine for salad, and all the other\r\nuses of _olive_ oil, and may be extracted, as is the flax-seed oil,\r\nor by boiling water, to the top of which it will rise, and may be\r\nskimmed, and bottled or put into casks. It is very common on the\r\nwest coast of Africa, and grows to most advantage on poor, sandy\r\nhills. It is said never to become rancid, but to improve with age.\r\n[Letter of Thomas M. Forman, Esq. Rose Hill, near Savington, Cecil,\r\nMd.] In the same letter is an account of Napoleon or Crawford RYE.\r\nIt is described to grow very tall, having a solid stalk, probably\r\ncapable of resisting the fly, like Jethro Tull's solid-stalked\r\nwheat. This grain is said to improve in the Cecil county soil and\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n2. Plan of FENCES of living trees for posts, such as the Sugar\r\nMaple, and _wire_ for rails; by White & Hazard, Whitestown,\r\nPhiladelphia county, lowest falls of Schuylkill. Common fence for\r\n100 acres, for 50 years, costs $3,080. Do. of wire fence for 50\r\nyears, costs $1,751. Add profit on trees, such as American black\r\nWalnut, curled or sugar Maple, Mulberry, Apple, (244 trees producing\r\nannually, at one dollar, $244) Buttonwoods, &c. which the projectors\r\nmake to produce $14,098, in fifty years. Interest on annual produce\r\nsufficient to keep such wire and live-tree fence in repair, from\r\nthe time of completion for ever. Other orchard lands can be spared.\r\nThese fences are good against the worst cows;--they are easy to\r\nrepair. Inquire at R. Watkin's tavern, at the falls of Schuylkill.\r\n\r\n3. Accounts of LIME and KILNS, and cooking STOVES, in Spain; by\r\nAnthony Morris, Esq. formerly of Philadelphia, now of Bucks county,\r\nPennsylvania, A. D. 1816.--In burning lime, the Spanish peasants\r\nuse only the small Shrub or brush wood, not larger than a man's\r\nlittle finger to the size of a pipe stem. The kiln is like ours in\r\nWhitemarsh, &c. except that the top of the kiln is very little above\r\nthe surface of the ground, and is covered with clay to confine the\r\nheat. The arch within is of such height as to give the full benefit\r\nof all the flame of those dry, light materials. The Spanish lime,\r\nlike our best Pennsylvania lime, is very good. The Spanish practice\r\nis recommended, where lime stone is plenty, wood scarce, and brush,\r\ntrash and weeds so abundant as to impede or injure culture. In the\r\nsame letter is a cheap method, as to fuel, for heating irons; and an\r\neconomical kitchen, as to fire, for cooking.\r\n\r\n4.

Thomas M. Randolph.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] See the engraving of Col. Randolph's Hill-side Plough, page 18,\r\n  vol. IV. Philadelphia Agricultural Society's Memoirs.\r\n\r\n5. An American Plough, approved in England; as is our Cradling\r\nScythe.\r\n\r\n6. Also, further notice of the Mangel Wurtzel, for the culture of\r\nwhich see the Philadelphia Society's Memoirs, vol. III. Seed of a\r\nnew kind, called the orange-coloured Mangel Wurtzel, has been sent\r\nto President Peters by Robert Barclay, Esq. grandson to the old\r\nApologist of Uri. The progress in the culture of this root, in Great\r\nBritain, is great. Mr. Peters thinks the mottled kind best, and\r\nrecommends the greatest care as to seed. It appears in other parts\r\nof this volume that 60 to 90 tons of Mangel Wurtzel, or Scarcity\r\nRoot, or the improved Beet, have been produced by an acre.\r\n\r\n5. In pages 107, 108, 109 and 110, are some interesting notices of\r\nthe Mangel Wurtzel, or Scarcity or Beet root, by Mr. Isaac C. Jones,\r\nof Philadelphia. It appears that this gentleman was led into some\r\nexperiments, after an entire city occupation of 20 years, by reading\r\nsome interesting accounts of such experiments in the European books.\r\nIn April, 1816, a piece of ground, not quite one fifth of an acre,\r\nwas planted with the seeds, in parallel rows, of two feet three or\r\nfour inches one way, by one foot the other. On gathering the crop in\r\nNovember, 1816, it was found that it weighed 8180 pounds, and that\r\nthe weight of the leaves, pulled off from those roots, at different\r\ntimes through the season, was 5,595 pounds. They would have been\r\nmore, but as the season of 1816 was uncommonly dry, the pulling was\r\nomitted for some weeks. This plant is very valuable for farm stock,\r\nand _most so for milch cows_. The leaves are excellent through the\r\nsummer, and the cut or chopped root through the winter, when dry\r\nfood is used. The Mangel Wurtzel, or Scarcity root or improved Beet,\r\nis excellent for the table, and is preferred by Mr. Jones' family\r\nto the red or garden beets, which are abundant and very fine in the\r\nPhiladelphia market. The same gentleman raised in 1816, on 23 square\r\npoles (23/160ths of an acre,) 110 bushels of the long or orange\r\nCarrot root, being at the rate of nearly 800 bushels to the acre. A\r\nbushel of those Carrots (cut with an approved instrument in the form\r\nof an S) weighed 47 lbs., and a bushel of the Mangel Wurtzel, cut\r\nin like manner, weighed 55 lbs. The Carrots produced 800 bushels,\r\nand the Mangel Wurtzel, at this rate, 900 bushels to the acre, each\r\n_in the uncut state_. As he planted the Mangel Wurtzel, Mr. Jones\r\nfound it easy to dress with the plough and one horse. The Carrots,\r\nwhen up, require the hoe and the hand altogether. It appears, that\r\nthe seeds of this plant, about which the utmost care is necessary,\r\nmay be had of John S. Skinner, Esq. Baltimore, and Mr. M'Mahon,\r\nPhiladelphia, and of the seedsmen in New York, Hartford, Boston,\r\n&c. The Mangel Wurtzel fell into some disrepute in England, about\r\nthe year 1810, but the marchioness of Salisbury revived it. It\r\nwas introduced into Ireland, in 1787, by seed from Dr. Letsom, of\r\nLondon, but the good qualities not being known, nor the culture, it\r\nfell into disuse in Ireland also. But a machine for the planting\r\nof it was invented by Mr. Edward Linsey, and now it is extensively\r\ncultivated there and much approved. The leaves produce two or more\r\ncrops in the north of Ireland in summer and autumn, and those\r\nleaves and the roots in winter are deemed excellent for milch and\r\nbeef cattle, in that great butter country. Irish sowing time is\r\nApril and May. Preparation the same as for turnips and potatoes:\r\ntwo drills to be opened two feet apart; sufficient dung to be used,\r\naccording to the state and quality of the ground. Then cover the\r\ndung with the double mould board plough, at once, or the single\r\nplough at twice, by ridging them up as high as can be well done,\r\nwith a man shovelling between the drills, right and left, smoothing\r\nthe surface of the dung, which will leave the ridge about a space of\r\nten or twelve inches broad. This complete method of fallowing will\r\nrepay the trouble of shovelling, by raising a full proportion of\r\nearth under the roots. When the ground is thus completely prepared,\r\ntwo boys or girls can sow from two to three acres per day. After\r\nsowing, it should be well rolled, which completes the process.\r\n\r\nThe crop is afterwards to be treated in the same manner as turnips\r\nor potatoes, by putting to and taking off mould, &c. After the roots\r\nhave been raised, the ground is in fine order for wheat or any other\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n_Example of Cultivation._--Wolf M'Neil, Esq. Ireland, sowed one\r\nacre; from the leaves, fed 40 pigs through the seasons of last\r\nsummer and fall; then gathered 84 tons of roots.--On these fed nine\r\ncows and five calves during winter, and had, on 22d April, 1815,\r\neight tons remaining, besides 100 roots, which he transplanted for\r\nsecuring good seed, _an all-important object_ in this culture.\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n     [We recommend to our readers the purchase and study of \"_The\r\n     Code of Agriculture_,\" written by Sir John Sinclair, the first\r\n     president of the _public_ British Board of Agriculture.

At a later period,\r\nCarrots were cultivated by some farmers: and within a few years\r\npast, the Mangel Wurtzel and the Rutga Baga have become objects\r\nof general cultivation. And now these five articles constitute\r\nessential branches of the highly improved Husbandry of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCOMMON TURNIPS. These for a long time were raised (and perhaps this\r\npractice is still very general) by sowing the seeds broad-cast, and\r\nweeding and thinning them with hoes, till the plants stood from a\r\nfoot to fifteen inches apart. But the most correct practice appears\r\nto be that of drilling the seeds in rows, thinning them at the\r\ndistance of ten or twelve inches in the rows, and hoeing and keeping\r\nthem clear from weeds. And this weak, watery root has been the\r\nprincipal food of immense flocks of store sheep, during the winter;\r\nand when plentifully given, only with the addition of straw, has\r\nserved to fatten cattle and sheep for the market.\r\n\r\nCARROTS, Even these plants, so long after they vegetate extremely\r\nsmall, were also raised from seed sown broad-cast. But this awkward\r\npractice, I believe, has generally given way to the row-culture,\r\nwhether the seeds were sown by hand, or by the instrument called a\r\ndrill. In very rich land, great crops have been raised where the\r\nrows were only from twelve to fifteen inches apart. The great crop\r\nof 752 bushels, weighing eighteen tons and three quarters raised\r\non one acre, in Salem, by Erastus Ware, in 1817, was in rows about\r\nsixteen inches apart. The seed was sown the 14th of May. But I am\r\ninclined to think a preferable mode would be, to sow the seeds in\r\ndouble rows about ten inches apart, with intervals of three feet\r\nbetween the rows, so as to admit a small plough, as well as the\r\nhoe, in their cultivation. In this case, a deep furrow being opened\r\nby the plough, the manure should be regularly thrown into it, and\r\ncovered by four back furrows, so forming a ridge over the manure;\r\nand this ridge being laid level with a light harrow, or with rakes,\r\nor if the soil be in fine tilth, by a light roller, will then be\r\nready to receive the seed. As soon as the Carrots are plainly to\r\nbe seen, they should be hoed and weeded; or the weeds will soon\r\noutstrip the Carrots (which are of very slow growth at first) and\r\nrender their cleansing vastly more troublesome and laborious.--They\r\nshould also be thinned, to stand single, and only from three to five\r\ninches apart in the rows; or the roots will be small, and cost much\r\nmore time in handling and topping (cutting or wringing off the tops)\r\nat the time of harvesting them. The entire crop, too, will doubtless\r\nbe smaller than when the plants are thinned as here recommended.\r\n\r\nTHE MANGEL WURTZEL. This plant yields a much more abundant crop than\r\nthe Carrot; and at the same time contains, in the same quantity or\r\nweight of roots, a great deal more nourishment; whence it is natural\r\nto suppose that it requires a richer soil than Carrots. I have not\r\nmade sufficient trials to enable me to express a decided opinion on\r\nthe best mode of cultivating the Mangel Wurtzel; and will therefore\r\nlay before you the successful practice, on strong land, in the\r\ncounty of Essex, in England, as it is stated, from a recent English\r\npublication, by the Philadelphia Society of Agriculture.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] Memoirs of the Society, Vol. III. Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe Mangel Wurtzel is sometimes called the Great, or Improved Beet,\r\nand Root of Scarcity; but now, more generally, Mangel Wurtzel, its\r\nGerman name. The following is the account of its culture at Bedford,\r\nin Essex.\r\n\r\n\"It may be proper, in the first place, to state what is meant by\r\n_strong land_. The surface soil is loamy, and from four to twelve\r\ninches deep, upon a bed of strong clay mixed with gravel. It is\r\ntoo heavy, and generally too wet, in the winter, even for sheep to\r\neat a crop of turnips on the ground; and although good turnips are\r\nraised upon it, it is always necessary to draw them for the sheep,\r\nstall-fed cattle, or cattle in the yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the middle, or latter end of the month of April, the furrows are\r\nset out with the plough, two feet apart, and double ploughed; that\r\nis, the plough returns on the [same] furrow to the point whence it\r\nset out, forming a ridge between each two furrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Double ploughing with a common plough is preferable to single\r\nploughing with a double mould board plough, because it affords a\r\ngreater depth of loose earth than the double mould board plough\r\nwould produce.\"\r\n\r\n\"In these furrows, the manure, which should be in a rotten state, is\r\ndeposited, after the rate of six cubic yards to an acre.\"[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Six cubic yards contain 162 cubic feet, or three cart loads for\r\n  a pair of oxen. A cart body, 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet\r\n  high, _in the clear_, contains 56 cubic feet; and three times 56 are\r\n  168.--I doubt the necessity of manure being \"in a rotten state,\"\r\n  seeing it is to be so deeply buried, for this or any other root crop\r\n  intended for the food of domestic animals; especially for Mangel\r\n  Wurtzel, which to obtain a full crop, should be sown very early,\r\n  as soon as the ground is dry enough to be ploughed. The powerful\r\n  fermentation of fresh dung might impart to the soil a salutary\r\n  warmth in the cool spring season--At least it may be worth while to\r\n  try it.\r\n\r\n\"The ridges are then split by the plough, going and returning the\r\nsame way as before mentioned; leaving the manure immediately under\r\nthe middle of the new ridges. A light roller is then passed along\r\nthe ridges,[6] in the middle of which the seed is dibbled, so that\r\nthe plants may receive all the benefit which can be derived from the\r\nmanure.\"[7]\r\n\r\n  [6] These narrow ridges, as formed by the plough, are sharp; by\r\n  passing a light roller over them, they are flattened to a breadth of\r\n  8 or 9 inches. The light roller, drawn by a horse, that walks in the\r\n  furrow between them, flattens two ridges at a time. Thus rolled, the\r\n  manure will be covered 8 or 9 inches deep.\r\n\r\n  [7] A dibble is a simple tool, which may be of different sizes and\r\n  forms, according to the uses it is intended to serve. If for setting\r\n  (in transplanting) cabbages or other like plants, it may be a round\r\n  stick about an inch and a quarter in diameter, shaved down at one\r\n  end (in a slope of 8 or 10 inches long) to a blunt point. An old\r\n  spade or shovel handle is well adapted to the purpose. If much used,\r\n  the slope may be advantageously covered smoothly with iron. But for\r\n  putting in _seeds_, the dibble may be in the form of the letter T.\r\n  To make one, take a piece of wood about 3 feet 4 inches long, and\r\n  about an inch and a quarter square. In one of the sides bore holes\r\n  in a line, and insert teeth at the proposed distance of the plants\r\n  in the row: if for Mangel Wurtzel, at 10, 11 or 12 inches apart; and\r\n  let the teeth be as long (projecting from the head place) as the\r\n  proposed depth at which the seeds are to be sown. On the opposite\r\n  side of the head-piece, bore a hole in the middle, large enough to\r\n  receive a handle of convenient length. On the top of the handle fix\r\n  a cross-piece 5 or 6 inches long, to be grasped by the hand in using\r\n  the tool.--With it, as many holes for seeds will be made, at every\r\n  movement, as there are teeth in the head. The handle may require\r\n  bracing, in like manner as a rake handle and its head is braced by\r\n  means of bows.\r\n\r\n  It now occurs to me, that perhaps the light roller used in levelling\r\n  the tops of the ridges may be set with teeth, and thus perform the\r\n  additional office of making holes for the seed; and with vastly\r\n  greater expedition than by dibbling. A light roller, long enough to\r\n  flatten two ridges at once, of 13 inches in diameter, and furnished\r\n  with two sets of four teeth each to pass along the middle of two\r\n  adjoining ridges--and the four teeth of each set being inserted at\r\n  equal distances in a circle of the roller,--the holes for the seed\r\n  would be made at the desired distance of near one foot from each\r\n  other. The teeth should be so shaped as to leave the holes made by\r\n  them fairly open. For this purpose they may be an inch and a half\r\n  wide and three quarters of an inch thick, where their shoulders are\r\n  fayed to the roller, and taper thence to a rounded thick edge at\r\n  their extremities. The same teeth, if not too long, may serve to\r\n  regulate and expedite the sowing of the Ruta Baga seed.\r\n\r\n\"The seed is deposited about an inch deep, whilst the moisture\r\nis fresh in the earth,[8] and covered by drawing a garden rake\r\nalong the rows. After this, the light roller is again passed along\r\nthe ridges, [to press the earth upon the seeds] and the work is\r\nfinished.\"\r\n\r\n  [8] It is very important to have seeds of all kinds sown as soon as\r\n  possible after the ground is ploughed and prepared to receive them,\r\n  and before the moisture of the fresh-stirred earth is dissipated by\r\n  the sun and drying winds; otherwise some may never vegetate, or not\r\n  till after a fall of rain; and so precious time may be lost, and an\r\n  uneven crop be produced.\r\n\r\n\"When the plants are about the size of a radish, they are hoed with\r\na turnip hoe, leaving the plants in the row about twelve inches\r\napart. If any of the seeds fail, and there happen not to be an even\r\ncrop, the roots where they are too thick are drawn out before the\r\nhoeing takes place, and transplanted to fill up the vacant places,\r\nand ensure a full crop; which is always certain, inasmuch as 99\r\nplants out of 100 thrive and do well. In transplanting, care is\r\nnecessary to prevent the point of the root from turning upwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weeds, while the plants are young, are kept hoed; but after the\r\nhead of the plant has once spread, no weed can live under its shade;\r\nand the expense of hoeing afterwards is trifling indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole of the crop is taken up in the month of November,[9] in\r\ndry weather. The tops are cut off near the _crown_ of the plants,\r\nand the plants, when perfectly dry, are piled up in a shed, and\r\ncovered with straw sufficiently thick to preserve them from the\r\nfrost. They kept last year till the latter end of March, and they\r\nwould have kept much longer.\"\r\n\r\n  [9] The time of taking up the Mangel Wurtzel must be regulated\r\n  by the climate. There is sometimes a frost in the latter part of\r\n  October, in this county, severe enough to injure this root, exposed,\r\n  as the greater part of it is above ground. Light frosts, however,\r\n  will do it no harm, while the roots remain in the ground, and in a\r\n  degree sheltered by their leaves.\r\n\r\n\"Where a field selected for a crop of Beet [the Mangel Wurtzel]\r\nhappens to be in a foul state, the seed had better be sown in a\r\ngarden, and the whole field planted with the young Beet, when of\r\nthe size of a radish. This will give time for cleaning the ground,\r\nand fitting it for a crop; for although the Beets are destroyers of\r\nweeds, it is not meant to recommend sowing them on foul ground, or\r\nin any way to encourage a slovenly system of farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"The method of cultivating the Beet root, here recommended, is the\r\nsame as that used in the cultivation of turnips, in Northumberland,\r\nand other parts of the North of England with this exception, that\r\nthe rows there are 27 inches apart.--There may be reasons in the\r\nNorth for still preserving that space; but in Essex the effect of\r\nit, in the cultivation of the Beet root, would be, that instead\r\nof 48 tons per acre, 43 tons only would be obtained. Experience\r\nhas proved, that the roots do not get to a larger size in rows\r\nthree feet apart, than they do in rows two feet apart. It may\r\ntherefore fairly be presumed, that they would not be larger, in rows\r\ntwenty-seven inches apart; and if not larger, the weight of the\r\ncrop, per acre, must be less, because the plants decrease in number\r\nas the rows increase in space.\"\r\n\r\nTo the preceding account of cultivating the Mangel Wurtzel, I will\r\nsubjoin a few\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nIn this mode it is intended that every two feet of ground should\r\nbear one plant: and as an acre contains 43,560 square feet, there\r\nwill be half of that number of plants on an acre, and the roots must\r\nweigh nearly five pounds each, on an average, to yield forty-eight\r\ntons. The land must indeed be strong to produce so heavy a crop. If\r\nour lands, enriched and prepared in the best manner conveniently in\r\nour power, can be made to yield half as much, we shall have reason\r\nto be satisfied: especially as the Mangel Wurtzel, quantity for\r\nquantity, contains more than twice as much nutritive matter as the\r\nRuta Baga, and even 50 per cent. more than Carrots; according to\r\nthe experiments (by analysis) of a celebrated English Chymist, Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, which he stated to the British Board of Agriculture.\r\nThese experiments were made with the red and white Beets; but it is\r\npresumed that the Mangel Wurtzel produces as much nutriment as any\r\nother Beet.\r\n\r\nInstead of 6 it may be advisable to apply at least 12 cubit yards\r\n(that is 6 such cart loads as were before-mentioned) of manure to\r\nan acre; and to distribute the same in deep furrows 4 feet apart.\r\nThis would give four square feet of ground to each plant, the plants\r\nbeing at a foot distance one from another in the rows, four feet\r\napart, would admit the use of the common horse plough in their\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nCarrots and the Mangel Wurtzel possess one eminent advantage; that\r\nthey are not, to my knowledge, annoyed by insects at any period of\r\ntheir growth. Whereas the Ruta Baga and other turnips, while in the\r\nseed leaf, are injured (in England whole fields are often destroyed)\r\nby a small black fly: and the Ruta Baga (like cabbages) when far\r\nadvanced in growth, is sometimes infested, and in dry seasons half\r\nruined, by plant lice; as was my small crop in 1818.\r\n\r\nThe Mangel Wurtzel also possesses one peculiar advantage above all\r\nother root crops, that as soon as the tops or leaves, are full\r\ngrown, they may be stripped off (leaving only the small heart-leaves\r\nuninjured) and given to cattle and swine.--This stripping may\r\nbe repeated once or twice; and it is said that the roots thrive\r\nbetter for the stripping. If not stripped off many of the under\r\nleaves perish. The leaves are pronounced excellent for increasing\r\nthe richness and quantity of milk in cows; and so are calculated\r\nto supply the deficiency of herbage in the common pastures, which\r\ngenerally fail, more or less, by the beginning of August. An acre\r\ntwice stripped will yield several tons of leaves.\r\n\r\nTHE RUTA BAGA. This root may be cultivated in the manner just\r\ndescribed for the Mangel Wurtzel; the ground being prepared in the\r\nsame manner. In England, they appear to be most commonly grown in\r\nrows 27 inches apart, with the plants at a foot distance in the\r\nrows. But William Cobbett, who in a small book, published in New\r\nYork, has minutely described his own practice, both in England and\r\nAmerica, asserts, that the largest crops are attainable by growing\r\nthe Ruta Baga in rows four feet apart, with the plants about 10\r\ninches or a foot distant from each other in the rows: and in this\r\nmode of culture, he has raised, in England, 30 tons to the acre.\r\n\r\nFor this mode of culture, the manure, being deposited in furrows\r\n4 feet apart, is covered by 4 back furrows, 2 on one side and 2\r\non the other, of each line of manure; by which little ridges are\r\nformed: and if the ploughing be deep (as it ought to be) there will\r\nbe a deep gutter between every two ridges.--The tops of the ridges\r\nbeing made fine with a light harrow, or with rakes, the seeds are\r\nsown with a drilling machine; or by hand, which Mr. Cobbett says he\r\nprefers to a drill. Two men sowed for him 7 acres in 3 days, using\r\nabout 4 pounds of seed, in this manner; a man went along by the\r\nside of each ridge, and put down 2 or 3 seeds in places at about\r\n10 inches from each other, just drawing a little earth over, and\r\n_pressing it on the seed_, in order to make it vegetate quickly,\r\nbefore the earth became too dry. But, he adds, the 7 acres might\r\nhave been sown by one man in a day, by just scattering the seeds\r\nalong on the top of the ridge, where they might have been buried\r\nwith a rake, and pressed down with a spade or shovel, or other flat\r\ninstrument. But he used a light roller, to take two ridges at once,\r\nthe horse walking in the gutter between.\r\n\r\nThe time of sowing the seeds must vary with the climate. On Long\r\nIsland, (state of New York) Mr. Cobbett's trials of one year led him\r\nto prefer the 26th of June; but in our own county, I would not pass\r\nthe middle of that month. Indeed I think it expedient (in order to\r\nascertain the fittest time) to commence sowing the seed as soon as\r\nthe ground can be prepared after the planting of Indian corn, and to\r\ncontinue to sow, in small plots, weekly, until the middle of June.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are fairly up, hoes and the fingers are to\r\nbe used, taking out all the plants but 1 in each 10 or 12 inches.\r\nAs soon as weeds appear, hoeing is to commence; hoeing the tops\r\nof the ridges to the width of about 6 inches, showing the plants\r\ndistinct and clean. Then the plough is introduced, taking a furrow\r\nfrom the side of one ridge, going up the field, a furrow from the\r\nother ridge coming down, then another furrow from the same side of\r\nthe first ridge going up, and another furrow from the same side of\r\nthe other ridge coming down. In taking away the last two furrows,\r\nyou go within three inches of the turnip plants. Thus a ridge is\r\nformed over the original gutter. The next process is, to turn these\r\nfurrows back again to the turnips. This hoeing and ploughing is\r\nto be repeated, when the appearance of the weeds requires it; and\r\nafterwards, the few weeds which may rise are to be hoed or pulled\r\nup. In this way, Mr. Cobbett thinks, a thousand bushels of Ruta Baga\r\nmay be raised on an acre that will yield 50 bushels of Indian corn.\r\n\r\nIn describing the culture of the Mangel Wurtzel, transplanting was\r\nmentioned, to fill vacant places. The same may be practised with\r\nthe Ruta Baga. But unless those vacant spots be dug afresh, the\r\ntransplanted roots will be much inferiour to their transplanted\r\nneighbours; as I found in my last year's experiment. And Mr.\r\nCobbett mentions the like difference in his practice.--At the\r\nsame time he strongly recommends the raising of the Ruta Baga, by\r\n_transplanting_, for _entire crops_, as for preferable to the sowing\r\nof the seeds, and letting the plants grow where their seeds first\r\nvegetated. But then he considers it indispensable to perform this\r\ntransplanting _on ground fresh ploughed_. And by sowing the seeds in\r\nbeds, to raise plants, as we do for cabbages, a month's more time\r\nis allowed to prepare the ground for their reception. In the work\r\nof transplanting, the plain dibble before described is a necessary\r\ninstrument. The hole made by it must be fully as deep as the length\r\nof the root; and this being introduced (taking care in putting it\r\ninto the hole not to bend its point) the dibble is thrust down by\r\nits side, and by a dexterous twist, or circular motion of the hand,\r\nthe earth is pressed close against the root, in its whole length.\r\nThe largest crop of Ruta Baga he ever raised in England, Mr. Cobbett\r\nsays, was by transplanting, on 17 acres, which produced 33 tons to\r\nthe acre; the rows (on ridges) 4 feet asunder, and the plants a foot\r\nasunder in the rows.\r\n\r\nIn this mode of raising the Ruta Baga, by transplanting the entire\r\ncrop, so much time is gained for preparing the ground, that two\r\ncrops of weeds may be destroyed, by that number of ploughings;\r\nthe first in the beginning of June, and the second immediately\r\nbefore transplanting. But Mr. Cobbett recommends a previous _deep_\r\nfall-ploughing, and another _deep_ ploughing in April, of the ground\r\nintended for the Ruta Baga. The like two deep ploughings will be\r\nequally proper and beneficial for the Mangel Wurtzel and Carrots.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages of the transplanting method, mentioned by Mr.\r\nCobbett, one is, that it \"saves almost the whole of the _after\r\nculture_. There is no _hoeing_, no _thinning_ of the plants; and not\r\nmore than one ploughing between the ridges.\"\r\n\r\n_Harvesting of Roots._ The Mangel Wurtzel, growing chiefly above the\r\nsurface, and thus exposed to frost, should be taken up the latter\r\nend of October or beginning of November, according to the nature\r\nof the season. The harvesting of Carrots may follow that of the\r\nMangel Wurtzel; and the Ruta Baga succeed the Carrots. In the first\r\nexperimental culture of the roots, in which but small quantities\r\nare raised, they can be preserved in dry cellars not liable to\r\nfreezing. Where large quantities are raised, they may be deposited\r\nin heaps, sufficiently covered, in a dry field. The common method\r\nof heaping and covering roots in the field, and which Mr. Cobbett\r\npractised with the Ruta Baga, is perhaps, as good as any. Holes of\r\na round or square form are dug about a foot deep, and about fifty\r\nbushels are put into each, piling up the roots above the level of\r\nthe surface of the land, sloping to the top: then covering them\r\nwith straw, throw earth over the whole to a depth sufficient to\r\nguard them from frost. Smooth the surface of this earth by beating\r\nit close with the back of a spade, or other instrument, the better\r\nto cast off rain. On Long Island and in Pennsylvania, a covering\r\nof earth, a foot or 15 inches deep has been found sufficient. A\r\ngreater depth will probably be necessary here. In throwing up this\r\ncover, a trench will be formed on all sides of the heap, to receive\r\nthe water running off it. It may be well to sink the bottom of the\r\ntrench lower than the bottom of the hole in which the roots are\r\ndeposited. Where large quantities are to be thus preserved, several\r\nloads may be put into one hole: and then oblong heaps will be best\r\nas requiring less labour in covering them. A quantity of roots,\r\nfor feeding cattle till the middle of December, may be kept in a\r\nbarn or stable covered with straw or any dry litter. I would begin\r\nfeeding with Mangel Wurtzel--follow next with Carrots--and conclude\r\nwith Ruta Baga; for the latter root will keep sound until the\r\ncommencement of the summer succeeding their growth.\r\n\r\nAll the roots, especially the Mangel Wurtzel and Carrots, should\r\nbe fully dried before they are housed, or covered in the field, to\r\nguard them against rotting.\r\n\r\n_Roots for raising Seed._ Of the Mangel Wurtzel I would select\r\nlarge and fair roots of a red colour, whose bodies have grown most\r\nabove ground, and with a moderate, if not the smallest, quantity of\r\nleaves; for although _these_ are valuable for stripping, the _roots_\r\nare much more valuable; and I am inclined to think those with small\r\ntops are least liable to rot.\r\n\r\nOf Carrots, large and fair roots of the deepest yellow colour, and\r\nwith the smallest tops in proportion to the size of the roots, are\r\nto be preferred.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Ruta Baga, Mr. Cobbett says, it is apt to\r\n_degenerate_, if the seed be not saved with care. \"We in England\r\n(said he) examine well to find out those that run least into _neck_\r\nand _green_. We reject all such as approach at all towards a\r\n_whitish_ colour, or which are even of a _greenish_ colour _towards\r\nthe neck_, which _there_ ought to be a little of a _reddish cast_.\"\r\n\r\nVarieties of plants of the _same kind_ (the different sorts of\r\ncabbages, for instance, or of Indian corn) if growing near together\r\nand bearing seed, will impart to one another their respective\r\npeculiarities, and injuriously, whenever it is desired to preserve\r\ntheir distinct qualities unmixed, and to prevent an inferiour\r\nengendering with one of a superiour quality; the impregnating dust\r\nof the flowers of plants falling on the flowers of other plants of\r\nthe same kind, producing effects similar to the crossing of animals\r\nof the same kind but of different breeds. In a word, the _sexual_\r\nsystem exists in plants as well as among animals; only in plants the\r\nmale and female are generally united in the same plant; as in Indian\r\ncorn, the male impregnating dust (the farina) is in the tassel or\r\nflower, at the top: the ear is the female, and from every cell of\r\nthe future grain proceeds a thread, which together constitute what\r\nis called the silk, on which the farina falling causes the cells\r\nto fill, and become, when ripe, kernels of corn. In most fruits,\r\nas the apple and pear, the male and female are in the same flower.\r\nBut in hemp, some of the plants are exclusively male, and others\r\nexclusively female.\r\n\r\nThe Ruta Baga, therefore, when set out for bearing seed, should be\r\nplaced at a distance from every other seed plant of the Turnip or\r\nCabbage kind. So likewise the Mangel Wurtzel intended to bear seed,\r\nshould not be set near any other seed beet plants. It may not be\r\namiss to add, that for the same reasons, pumpkins, squashes, melons,\r\ncucumbers, in all their varieties, in order to preserve them in\r\npurity, should be planted at some distance from each other.\r\n\r\nPumpkins, as food for domestic animals, seem closely connected with\r\nthe roots before-mentioned. Every farmer knows their value for\r\nmilk cows, for fattening cattle, and for swine. Their consumption\r\nconveniently precedes that of the Mangel Wurtzel.\r\n\r\nWith ample supplies of the Vegetables whose culture I have mentioned\r\nand described, our present Stocks may be better fed, their numbers\r\nenlarged, our coarse fodder be more advantageously consumed,\r\nour manure increased, and pork and beef and the products of the\r\ndairy, probably doubled. The latter, in particular, are miserably\r\ndeficient, from the want of juicy food for cows, in continuance\r\nof the supply yielded by our common pastures just at midsummer.\r\nPumpkins and the roots, indeed, will not be ready to keep up that\r\nsupply; but oats and barley, and above all Indian corn, may be sown\r\nand planted, to be cut green, and carry along our cows to the last\r\nof September, when pumpkins will begin to ripen. The consumption\r\nof these green crops and roots, by producing vast additions to our\r\nmanure, will enable us to enrich our fields, and to make annual\r\nadditions to the products of our farms.\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of providing for cows a full supply of food,\r\nand of food which they relish, to the extent of their appetites, has\r\nbeen demonstrated by many examples of very large products of milk,\r\nbutter and cheese, from cows so supplied. The following statement\r\nfrom a recent English publication, is a further illustration of the\r\nfact:--\"A farmer, some years since, kept _eighteen_ cows upon a\r\n_Common_, and was often obliged to buy butter for his family. The\r\nCommon was _enclosed_, (which deprived the farmer of his pasture,)\r\nand the same person supplied his family amply with milk and butter,\r\nfrom _four_ cows _well kept._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. On Indian Corn and Winter Grain._\r\n\r\nThe ancient, and to this day the general practice, in cultivating\r\nIndian corn, has been to plant it in squares, and in the course of\r\nits growth to draw up earth about the stems of the plants, forming\r\n_hills_; under the idea of supporting them against strong winds; but\r\nthe necessity or utility of this practice has long been doubted.\r\nI have sometimes cultivated Indian corn without raising any hills\r\nabout the plants; and, from the result, am satisfied that hills\r\nare not necessary. If, indeed, winter wheat, or rye, is to be sown\r\namong the corn, at its last dressing, I think the hilling must be\r\ninjurious; for the richer mould being drawn up into hills, the\r\nintervals are robbed of what is requisite to produce an even crop.\r\n\r\nI am aware that some intelligent farmers consider it bad husbandry\r\nto sow winter grain among Indian corn--to _double-crop_ the ground.\r\nBut if this be _rich_, and in _fine tilth_ by deep ploughing before\r\nthe corn crop is put in, and good and clean tillage accompanying\r\nits growth, I can perceive no solid objection to the practice. With\r\nus, the early sowing of winter grain is of the first importance, to\r\ninsure a full crop, early ripe, and most secure from mildew. The\r\nhusbandry of Mr. Ducket, already described, justifies the practice.\r\nI know it is already common amongst us; but without the _deep\r\ntillage_ which enabled him to put in seven crops with only four\r\nploughings. With such complete tillage, of a soil so enriched as to\r\nyield forty or fifty bushels of Indian corn to the acre, grown on\r\na level, without hills or ridges; and if, in harvesting the corn,\r\nit be cut close to the ground; I see no reason why grass seeds may\r\nnot properly be sown on the winter grain, in the spring. In this\r\nway, may be obtained a crop of Indian corn the first year--a crop of\r\nwheat or rye the second year--and hay the third and fourth years;\r\nand all from one deep ploughing, and a handsome culture of the\r\nIndian corn.\r\n\r\nBy the early sowing of winter grain among Indian corn, it quickly\r\nvegetates, and sends forth numerous branches; and soon covering the\r\nground, prevents or checks the growth of weeds. Probably, too, the\r\nplants, acquiring so much strength by early sowing (for the roots\r\nmust multiply and extend in proportion to the growth above ground)\r\nare less liable to be winter-killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV. On Live Stock._\r\n\r\nI have now to present to your notice the other of the three\r\ncelebrated English Farmers, described by Arthur Young--Mr.\r\nBakewell--the most distinguished improver of live stock, on\r\nprinciples of his own, in Great Britain. \"The principles he began\r\nupon (says Mr. Young) were _fine forms_, _small bones_, _and a\r\ntrue disposition to make readily fat_, which is indeed inseparable\r\nfrom small bones, or rather fine bones, and fine forms, or true\r\nsymmetry of the parts.\" Before Bakewell's day, the rules which\r\ngoverned Breeders of Live Stock, Mr. Young pronounces a tissue \"of\r\nabsurdities.\"\r\n\r\nHe began his improvements of sheep, by selecting from the best\r\nin his neighbourhood. And so little had any correct principle of\r\nimprovement been known, or regarded, that a guinea or half a guinea\r\nextraordinary would give Mr. Bakewell the choice of any sheep in\r\nany flock. And his uncommon sagacity enabled him, by the best\r\nselections and judicious crossings, to form a breed distinguished\r\nabove all others, for _the disposition to fatten_, _early maturity_,\r\n_a form indicating strength of constitution_, _weight in the most\r\nvaluable parts_, with _lightness of offals_. Mr. Young expresses\r\nhis opinion, that there is not a breed of any sort of live stock\r\nin Great Britain, that does not derive its improvement from the\r\nskill, knowledge and principles of Mr. Bakewell. Another eminent\r\nAgriculturalist declares, (and Mr. Young does not think he\r\nexaggerates) \"that Mr. Bakewell enabled those who followed his\r\nideas, to produce two pounds of mutton where only one was produced\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Young adds, that Bakewell was the most careful feeder of stock\r\nthat he ever met with, and who made his food go the farthest. To\r\nhorses and cattle in stalls, he did not permit more than a handful\r\nof hay to be given at a time; and the same economy was used in all\r\nother feeding.--But his stocks were so large as to require one or\r\nmore persons to be appropriated to that service. This practice, in\r\nour small farms and with our small stocks, cannot be fully adopted;\r\nbut it may be imitated, in some degree, during the season (winter)\r\nmost requiring such attention. By feeding them in this manner, the\r\ncattle will doubtless _eat more_, but they will _waste less_; so\r\nthat while, in the whole, no more fodder will be consumed, the stock\r\nwill be put into much better plight.\r\n\r\nCleanliness, also, will materially contribute to the health and\r\nthriving of stock. The common cattle-stalls of our country are so\r\nill contrived, and so straitened in their dimensions, that the\r\ncattle are constrained to lie down, in part in their own dung. This\r\ndries and forms a thick coat on their hind quarters, from which\r\nthey are not relieved till they shed their hair in the spring. They\r\nare thus rendered _uncomfortable_; to be _uncomfortable_ is to\r\nsuffer some degree of _pain_; and no one will suppose that animals\r\nin _pain_ can _thrive_, or _preserve their plight_, with the same\r\nfood, equally with others perfectly at ease. Even hogs, though prone\r\nto wallow in the mire, in warm weather, are always pleased with a\r\ndry bed, and thrive best when kept clean. I have some where read an\r\naccount of an experiment made with two, confined in separate pens,\r\nand fed exactly alike: one was suffered to be constantly foul with\r\nthe mire of his sty; the other, washed every day, and kept clean,\r\nfar outstripped the former in thriving.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to add some further information on Live Stock,\r\nfrom the writings of Sir John Sinclair, President of the British\r\nBoard of Agriculture. He proposed to a gentleman in England,[10]\r\nwho is eminent for his knowledge and accurate observations relative\r\nto plants and animals, some questions concerning Live Stock.\r\nIn one of his answers, he says--\"I have found the food animals\r\ngenerally require, to keep them in proper condition, is much more\r\nnearly proportioned to their _height_ and _length_, than to their\r\n_weight_.\" In confirmation of this opinion, he adds, that one of his\r\nneighbours made a comparative experiment with the Devon and Hereford\r\ncows; and though fond of the former for their neatness, he gave\r\nthem up, because \"they would not nearly live upon the same food\r\nwhich supplied animals _stouter_ and _more compact_, of the same\r\nweight.\"\r\n\r\n  [10] Thomas A. Knight, Esq.\r\n\r\nTo the question, \"What is the best shape for feeding with little\r\nfood?\" Mr. Knight answers--\"The more deep and capacious the chest,\r\nand the shorter and lower any animal is, relative to its weight,\r\nthe better adapted it will be to live and fatten upon little food;\r\nthe more labour it will also go through; and I have always found\r\nthe short legged oxen to be the best labourers. Mr. Marshall also\r\nobserves, in his Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, that the best\r\nlabouring ox he ever saw, had the shortest legs.\"\r\n\r\nI will detain the Society no longer than to make a few observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V. On Orchards._\r\n\r\nI advert to this subject for the purpose of suggesting the utility\r\nof propagating Sweet Apples.\r\n\r\nAfter providing a due proportion of apples for the table, and the\r\nordinary purposes of cookery, I do not hesitate to express my\r\nopinion, that for all other uses, sweet apples are entitled to the\r\npreference. The best cider I ever tasted in this country, was made\r\nwholly of sweet apples. They afford also a nourishing food to man\r\nand all domestic animals. What furnishes a more delicate repast\r\nthan a rich sweet apple baked and eaten with milk? I recollect the\r\nobservation made to me by an observing farmer, before the American\r\nrevolution, that nothing would fatten cattle faster than sweet\r\napples. Mentioning this, a few years since, to a gentleman of my\r\nacquaintance in an adjoining state, he informed me, that he was once\r\nadvised to give sweet apples to a sick horse. Happening then to have\r\nthem in plenty, the horse was served with them, and he soon got\r\nwell: and continuing to be fed with them, he fattened faster than\r\nany other horse he had ever owned (and he had owned many) that was\r\nfed with any other food.\r\n\r\nMentioning to the same gentleman, what I had long before heard, that\r\na good molasses might be made of sweet apples, he confirmed the\r\nfact by an instance within his own knowledge: and further expressed\r\nhis opinion (and I have not known a man whose practical judgment\r\nwas entitled to more respect) that it would not be difficult,\r\nby forming orchards of sweet apples, to supply molasses for the\r\ngeneral consumption of the United States. I have never tasted any\r\nsweet apple molasses; but I suppose it has not (nor has honey) the\r\nrich sweet of molasses from the sugar-cane; yet, for family uses\r\nin general, it would be a useful substitute for the latter. The\r\nprocess in making it I suppose to be very simple.--The apples being\r\nground, and the juice (or cider) expressed, at the cider-mill, it is\r\nimmediately boiled, (that is, before any fermentation takes place)\r\nand the scum being taken off as it rises, the boiling is continued\r\nuntil the liquor acquires the consistence of molasses.\r\n\r\nSweet apples are of different degrees of sweetness. Those of the\r\nrichest kinds should be chosen for the purpose of making molasses.\r\nBut in grafting, the cions should be taken (as they ought to be for\r\nall kinds of fruit) not from old, worn out trees, but from those\r\nwhose originals are in full health and vigour.--For it has been\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained in England, (and proofs of it are not\r\nwanting in our own country) that fruit trees have their infancy,\r\n(springing from seeds) youth, maturity, and old age; and that when\r\nthey have reached this last stage, it is in vain that attempts are\r\nmade to continue them. Or if the cions take, and grow for a few\r\nyears, they are unproductive, and soon decay. The reason is plain:\r\nevery cion is a part of the tree from which it is taken; and if this\r\nbe in a state of decrepitude, so will be the cion; and although\r\ngrafted on a youthful, thrifty stock, it will be of no avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cargo of new wheat from North Carolina, of 1200 bushels, was sold\r\nlast month, in Philadelphia, at 94-1/2 cents cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the Plough Boy.)\r\n\r\nFLEMISH HUSBANDRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weeding and hoeing._--The Flemish farmer never considers his work\r\nhalf done until his fields are completely freed from weeds. This\r\nis effected, in a great measure, by repeated digging, by which the\r\nupper stratum that contains the seeds and roots of noxious plants,\r\nis buried sufficiently deep into the ground to prevent their\r\nvegetating. When weeds do appear, they are immediately extirpated\r\neither by the harrow before the grain is sown, or afterwards\r\nby careful and repeated hand hoeings. This they find the more\r\nnecessary, to rid the earth of parasite plants, the seeds of which\r\nare mixed with the seeds of culinary vegetables, and produce\r\nplants that feed on the juices of the dung, to the great injury\r\nof the legitimate stock. A Flemish farm, in consequence of these\r\nattentions, resembles more a highly cultivated garden, than many\r\nplaces which bear that name. When I first beheld these fields,\r\nI supposed them actually to be gardens, and was only undeceived\r\nwhen further observation and inquiry convinced me, that the whole\r\ncountry was cultivated in a similar manner, and presented the same\r\ndelightful scene.\r\n\r\n_Choice of Seeds._--It is an invariable practice in Flanders, never\r\nto use for seed the grain grown on the land to be sown; nor is the\r\nexpense regarded when the object is to obtain heavy and healthy\r\nseed. Farmers in distant districts exchange seeds with each other,\r\nand journies of hundreds of miles are frequently taken to accomplish\r\nthis desirable purpose. Vanderstractan mentions two farmers, whose\r\ngrounds were alike, and who cultivated them with equal skill and\r\nindustry. They had both been long in the practice of procuring\r\nexcellent seed potatoes from Brabant, which yielded in that province\r\ntwo hundred cwt. per English acre. When transplanted, the produce\r\nwas regularly, year after year, five hundred and forty cwt. per\r\nacre.[11] One of these men having, one year, to save the expense\r\nof carriage, used potatoes of his own growth, the original produce\r\nof Brabant, soon repented the step, and returned to his former\r\npractice. Flanders usually receives its supply of flax-seed from the\r\nnorth of Europe; but having, during the latter years of the reign\r\nof Napoleon, been deprived of that supply, through his restrictive\r\ndecrees; the produce of that valuable plant was not more than half\r\nthe usual quantity, which besides was greatly inferior to preceding\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n  [11] This great produce cannot fail to astonish many persons living\r\n  in this country. But let them recollect, that the upper layer of the\r\n  soil, from which the crops are produced, is never changed here; that\r\n  this layer, having been so often used, must have lost part of its\r\n  ancient fertility; that dung is not spread in abundance with us as\r\n  in Flanders; and that it is possible the species of potatoes grown\r\n  here have degenerated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Flemish are the most particular people in the world\r\nas to the choice of their seeds, they are sometimes deceived. An\r\ninstance of this happened a few years ago, which was followed by\r\nvery injurious consequences. A person brought some flax-seed from\r\nRiga, which he sold for sound seed. It was, however, superanuated,\r\nbut he had contrived to give it a fresh and healthy appearance,\r\nand thus imposed on the best judges. The farmers, deceived by the\r\nfalse mark, bought and sowed the seed, none of which ever appeared\r\nabove the ground. \"The desolation of the country was universal; the\r\nloss was estimated at several millions of florins; and the offender\r\nescaped the punishment he merited, only through the intercessions\r\nof several powerful friends, who found means to stifle the affair,\r\nnotwithstanding the cries of its numerous victims.\" I recollect a\r\ncase somewhat similar to this, which happened a few years ago in\r\nEdinburgh. A respectable seed merchant there purchased a quantity\r\nof flax-seed from a foreigner, which he sold again in small parcels\r\nto the farmers, who, on sowing it, found that it was unsound, as no\r\npart of it was productive. The seed merchant was sued, and although\r\nhe distinctly proved, that he made the purchase himself under the\r\nimpression that the seed was fresh, and paid a fair price for it, he\r\nwas found liable in damages to the amount of the loss sustained by\r\nthe farmer who sued, upon the ground that he was bound to guarantee\r\nevery article which he sold at the regular market price, whether he\r\nwas imposed upon himself or not. These lessons were not thrown away.\r\nIn Flanders, as well as in Scotland, no foreign seed is purchased,\r\nuntil the purchasers be fully satisfied as to the quality of the\r\narticle, and the character of the seller.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish practice, with regard to a change of seeds, has long\r\nprevailed in Scotland, not only as to potatoes, but as to wheat,\r\nbarley, oats, and all other grain. The Scotch potatoes have\r\nalways appeared to me superior to those raised in England, where\r\nthe same attention is not shown to the choice of seed. It is a\r\nfact, also, well known in these countries, that the barley raised\r\nin Scotland, though greatly inferior in _appearance_ to English\r\nbarley, and raised in a colder climate, contains more saccharine\r\nmatter, or nourishment. This has been tested by experiments at\r\nthe distilleries, under the immediate inspection of officers\r\nappointed by the government, who reported a greater quantity of\r\nspirit obtained from barley, the growth of Scotland, than from that\r\nproduced in England. The beef sold in the London markets, which\r\nhad been reared in the Scotch distilleries upon the refuse grains,\r\nuniformly sells at from three to four cents a pound more than that\r\nfed at any of the English distilleries.\r\n\r\nThis superiority unquestionably arises from the greatly improved\r\nsystem of agriculture, _generally_ introduced into Scotland, but\r\nit is owing in nothing so much as to the very scrupulous attention\r\nthere paid to the choice of seed. Of late years, this branch of\r\nhusbandry seems to have considerably attracted the notice of\r\nthe English farmers; some of whom, as appears from the English\r\nnewspapers, have found it greatly to their interest to cultivate\r\nwheat, in particular, obtained from foreign places, which, when\r\ngrown, they convey to distant parts of the country, and sell\r\nexclusively for seed wheat. It was mentioned in the Cumberland\r\nPacket (an English journal) of 14th October, 1816, \"that a farmer\r\nhad obtained _l._40, ($170,) per load, of 30 bushels, for seed\r\nwheat, on account of its great product. He had also, obtained the\r\nsame price for seven years past for this wheat, which had been\r\noriginally imported from abroad.\"\r\n\r\n_Rotation of Crops_--The intelligent agriculturalists of England are\r\nwell aware, that the more the rotation of crops are varied, the more\r\nabundant is their produce; but this opinion is confined to a few in\r\nthat country. It is only in Flanders that the idea of exhausting the\r\nsoil, by repeated cropping, is exploded, and the rotation system\r\nbrought to the greatest possible state of perfection. The ground\r\nbeing prepared in the manner before stated, the Flemish farmer\r\nadopts either one or the other of the following courses:\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.\r\n\r\n_First year._--Oats are sown about the end of February, or beginning\r\nof March. These are cut green toward the end of April, or beginning\r\nof May, and given to the cattle for food, which they eat with great\r\npleasure. It is found that this crop, as it is not allowed to throw\r\nout the ears, does not exhaust the soil, or take anything from the\r\nsubsequent crop.[12] Winter potatoes are now sown for a _second_\r\ncrop; previous to which the land is dug and manured. When of a\r\nmiddling size the potato is planted whole, but if very large, the\r\neye only is used.\r\n\r\n  [12] It is well known, that vegetables will grow in pure sand, by\r\n  watering them, and that it is not till they blossom, or rather till\r\n  they produce seed, that they perish. It is mentioned by Bracconnot,\r\n  in the _Annales de Chimie_, for February and March, 1808, that he\r\n  sowed the seeds of various plants in pure river sand, in litharge,\r\n  in flour of sulphur, and even among metal, or common leaden shot;\r\n  and in every instance he employed only _distilled water_ for their\r\n  nourishment. The plants throve, and passed through all the usual\r\n  gradations of growth to perfect maturity. The author then proceeded\r\n  to gather the entire produce, the roots, stems, leaves, pods, &c.\r\n  These were accurately weighed, dried, and again weighed; then\r\n  submitted to the ordinary means used in a careful analysis, when\r\n  he obtained from these vegetables, all the materials peculiar to\r\n  each individual species, precisely as if it had been cultivated\r\n  in a natural soil. \"Oxygen and hydrogen, (says this writer) with\r\n  the assistance of solar light, appear to be the only elementary\r\n  substances employed in the constitution of the whole universe: and\r\n  Nature in her simple progress, works the most infinitely diversified\r\n  effects by the slightest modification in the means she employs.\"\r\n\r\n_Second year._--Wheat forms the first crop; and scarcely are the\r\nsheaves removed from the ground, when the farmer promptly turns up\r\nthe earth, and sows spurry. Sometimes carrots are sown with the\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\n_Third year._--Rye; which is followed by Turnips.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.\r\n\r\n_First year._--Flax preceded by green oats. After the flax, carrots.\r\n\r\n_Second year._---Wheat; followed by Spurry.\r\n\r\n_Third year._--Rye and turnips.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.\r\n\r\n_First year._--Female Hemp; after which, Turnips.\r\n\r\n_Second year._--Flax, then carrots.\r\n\r\n_Third year._--Wheat and spurry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH COURSE FOR THREE YEARS.\r\n\r\n_First year._--Flax, preceded by green corn. After the flax, carrots.\r\n\r\n_Second year._--Cole-seed; then turnips.\r\n\r\n_Third year._--Wheat; then spurry.\r\n\r\nThese courses are sufficient to give a pretty correct idea of\r\nthe Flemish system of rotation. It will be seen that wheat never\r\nsucceeds to clover: it almost always follows flax, hemp, cole-seed\r\nor potatoes. Clover greatly encourages the growth of dog grass,\r\nwhich, if not completely torn up, with all its roots, the least\r\nfibres of the latter which escape, will each produce a new plant,\r\ngreatly to the prejudice of the wheat. In England the fields are\r\nalways more or less infected with this pest, while the practice\r\npursued in Flanders completely protects them against it--Wheat is\r\nalso materially benefited in Flanders, by the repeated digging up,\r\nand hoeings, which potatoes require; and by the abundance, and\r\njudicious application of manure, spread during the first year of\r\nthe course. This loses only part of its fertilizing salts, leaving\r\nthe earth in a high state of fertility, which the Flemish farmer\r\nknows well how to augment to the requisite degree without causing\r\nthe wheat to shed; a circumstance apt to occur, where too great a\r\nquantity of manure is used.\r\n\r\nThe following comparative tables, shewing the value which is\r\nobtained from one acre in _four_ years, by a farmer, following\r\nthe Norfolk course, in England, and that obtained, from the same\r\nspace in _three_ years according to the Flemish course, will best\r\nillustrate the superior advantages of the latter over the former:\r\n\r\n           TABLE I.----ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  1st. _year_.

The advantages\r\nof the Flemish farmer, will appear still more striking, when the\r\nnett profit which he clears, after paying the necessary expenses of\r\ncultivation is contrasted with that of the English farmer. According\r\nto Arthur Young, the English farmer receives about four and a half\r\ntwentieths of the produce, calculating the gross produce of the soil\r\nat twenty. This upon _l._4 18 6-1/4, (the result per acre, for one\r\nyear, as in Table I.) would give _l._1 2 1-1/4.\r\n\r\nThe produce, per acre, for one year, in Flanders (see Table II.) is\r\n_l._7 9 1; the expense of cultivation, land tax, and rent, according\r\nto Vanderstraten, is _l._4 0 1; leaving to the farmer _l._3 9 0; or\r\nnearly _four_ times the amount obtained by the English farmer.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _Flemish Husbandry_ is by no means exhausted. I shall\r\nresume it in future communications.\r\n\r\n  Your's, respectfully,\r\n\r\n  GEO.

JUNE 21, 1820.\r\n\r\n     [The following interesting document giving an account of the\r\n     proceedings of the Chester County Agricultural Society, is well\r\n     worthy the attention of our agricultural readers.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Agricultural Society of Chester County,\r\nheld at the Courthouse in Westchester, 6th Mo. 10th, 1820, Dr.\r\nWilliam Darlington, Vice-President, in the Chair; Isaac Sharpless,\r\nSecretary. The Committee of Correspondence produced to the meeting\r\nthe following Report; which being read was unanimously adopted, viz.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT.\r\n\r\nThe Committee appointed by the Society to propose plans for its\r\nadoption, believing that the objects which may properly claim the\r\nattention of the Association, are very numerous, are therefore\r\nfree to suggest, whether it would not be advantageous to institute\r\nseveral standing committees, each of which should cultivate a\r\nparticular department of Agriculture, or some of the sciences that\r\nmay minister to its improvement.\r\n\r\nIf the Society should approve of this plan, we propose that these\r\ncommittees should be made up by voluntary associations among the\r\nmembers as far as practicable, each being at liberty to join himself\r\nto such as he may choose, and all vacancies and deficiences in\r\nthe numbers of said committees should be filled by the presiding\r\nofficer. They should in no case consist of less than five members,\r\nwhose names should be entered on the minutes of the Society; and\r\nthey should each have a secretary to receive communications, to\r\narrange and digest the scattered materials they may collect, and\r\nto lay before the society such as may be thought worthy of its\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAll books, models, drawings, or specimens, that any of these\r\ncommittees procure in the course of their labours, shall be kept in\r\nsuch place as it should direct.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the formation of the following standing\r\ncommittees be authorized at the time--to be renewed at the first\r\nstated meeting in each year.\r\n\r\n1st. A committee on farm buildings, fences and implements of\r\nhusbandry. To study the improvement of houses, barns, barn-yards and\r\nout buildings, both as it regards the plan and materials. To examine\r\nthe relative cost of the different kinds of fences, and the best\r\nmethods of constructing or raising them. To make improvements in\r\nthe implements of husbandry, and to introduce such as may be made in\r\nother places.\r\n\r\n2d. A committee on the Veterinary Art--To investigate the nature\r\nand origin of the diseases of domestic animals, and endeavour to\r\nascertain the best methods of prevention and cure.\r\n\r\n3d. A committee on Natural History, particularly Mineralogy and\r\nEntomology. To develope the mineral productions of the County, and\r\nto ascertain its geological structure, partly for the purpose of\r\ndesignating the kind of soil in each neighbourhood. To examine the\r\nhabits of such insects as injure the crops of the farmer, with a\r\nview of discovering the means of destroying them, or preventing\r\ntheir ravages; and such other branches of Natural History as are\r\ninteresting to the Agriculturalist.\r\n\r\n4th. A committee on Political Economy. To attend to the political\r\ninterests of Agriculture, and examine the manner in which public\r\nmeasures affect it. To inquire into the utility of public\r\nimprovements, such as canals, bridges, and turnpike roads, and into\r\nthe means of giving the Agricultural class its due weight in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n5th. A committee on Domestic Animals. To inquire after and introduce\r\nthe best kind, to endeavour to ascertain the most economical and the\r\nbest methods of rearing, managing and feeding them, together with\r\nfacts on the relative advantages of the employment of horses and\r\noxen for labour.\r\n\r\n6th. A committee on grasses, grains and roots. To inquire after and\r\nrecommend the best and most profitable kinds, the time and manner of\r\nsowing and planting, with the most proper quantity of each per acre,\r\nalso the previous preparation of the ground and seed, together with\r\nthe best method of culture.\r\n\r\n7th. A committee on Manures.--To endeavour to ascertain the\r\nrelative advantages of barn-yard manure, plaister, lime, burnt\r\nclay, ashes, and all other kinds of manure, with the time and manner\r\nof application of each, whether best applied on ploughed or grass\r\nlands, on the surface or ploughed in, deep or shallow; together with\r\nthe best methods of accumulating and preparing barn-yard and stable\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n8th. A committee on fruit and forest trees.--To endeavour to\r\nascertain the best and most useful fruits of all kinds, with the\r\nbest method of making wine, and cider, &c. To examine the causes\r\nof the premature decay of fruit trees, with a view to their\r\npreservation. To ascertain the best time of cutting forest trees, as\r\nit respects the durability of the wood, under ground, or exposed to\r\nthe weather; also for fuel.\r\n\r\n9th. A committee on irrigation and draining.--To ascertain the most\r\nprofitable times of irrigation, with its uses. Also, the best and\r\nmost effectual methods of constructing drains.\r\n\r\n10th. A committee on Horticulture.--To ascertain the best and\r\nmost approved methods of managing kitchen gardens, attend to the\r\nintroduction of useful vegetables, modes of culture, &c.; and also\r\nto promote good taste in the planning and arrangement of gardens\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nWe further propose that the society recommend to each of its\r\npractical members, regularly to enter in writing, the preparation\r\nand state of the ground, at the time of sowing or planting each\r\ncrop, the quantity and kind of manure and seed per acre, particulars\r\nrelative to the weather, the process of culture, the times of sowing\r\nand gathering, and the amount of produce per acre, with such other\r\nparticulars as may be thought worthy of notice, each part of which\r\nto be annually laid before them, in order that such facts as are\r\ndeemed worthy of preservation, may be laid before the society.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the members of the society generally, and such\r\nothers as are friendly to the objects of the association, be\r\nrequested to furnish the several committees above named with such\r\ninformation relative to the subjects for which they are appointed as\r\nmay be in their possession.\r\n\r\n  WM. DARLINGTON, _V. Prest._\r\n\r\n  ISAAC SHARPLESS, _Sec'y._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CULTURE OF TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurnips for fall and winter use are generally sown in the last of\r\nJuly. I have been long apprehensive that this sowing was too early.\r\nThe weather at this season of the year is generally very hot and\r\nvery dry; and drought has a direct tendency to dwarf and spoil a\r\nfield of young turnips; the black fly, also, a natural enemy of the\r\nturnip, is at this period very voracious, and the crop is too often\r\ndestroyed, or rendered unprofitable from one or the other of these\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nWith a view to remedy these evils, I sowed my turnips two seasons\r\nago, very late in August. My neighbours laughed at me, and said\r\nI would not have a single mess. I had, however, more and better\r\nturnips than any of them. Encouraged by the success, I sowed the\r\nlast year, on the 25th of August, a small piece of ground, eight\r\nrods only, with turnips. They came up well, and not a fly touched\r\nthem. When they had four or five leaves I directed one of my men to\r\nweed and thin them, so as to have them stand eight or ten inches\r\napart. The ground afterwards was slightly stirred with a garden\r\nhoe. The leaves grew rapidly, covered the ground, and prevented\r\nthe further growth of weeds. On the 11th of November, I pulled the\r\nturnips, trimmed and measured them, and had on the eight rods of\r\nground, (the twentieth part of one acre only,) forty-five bushels of\r\nas large and well formed turnips as I ever saw. This produce is at\r\nthe rate of nine hundred bushels to the acre. The soil is a sandy\r\nloam, in good heart, but by no means in high tilth.\r\n\r\nI sowed two other small pieces of ground, the one on the 1st, and\r\nthe other on the 8th of September. Neither of these yielded like the\r\none sowed on the 25th August; but each of them produced much larger\r\nand better turnips, than I have seen, that were sowed at the usual\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI attribute my success altogether to the late sowing; the heat is\r\nthen less intense, the rains more frequent, the dews more copious,\r\nthe fly harmless, and the crop abundant.\r\n\r\nI would earnestly recommend to the farmers to set apart a small\r\npiece of ground, and try the experiment of late sowing, and I am\r\nconfident they will be amply compensated for making the attempt, by\r\na greater increase of crops.\r\n\r\n  [_Connecticut Courant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the American Farmer.)\r\n\r\n_On the use of Oxen and deep ploughing in New England, by Josiah\r\nQuincy, Esq._\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, Nov. 2, 1817.\r\n\r\n_My dear Sir_,\r\n\r\nIn reply to your inquiries in your last letter I answer:--Oxen are\r\nused almost wholly for plough and team work in this quarter of the\r\ncountry. A single horse is usually kept by our principal farmers, to\r\ngo to mill, and to church, and for the convenience of the family.\r\nOccasionally he precedes the oxen at plough, or on the road. This\r\nis so universal as to be almost without exception, among mere\r\nfarmers. They certainly answer all purposes, except perhaps speed;\r\nand in this, on a long journey, they are considered as quite equal\r\nto horses. But of this our farmers have not many opportunities of\r\ncomparison, oxen are so universally used. They are \"worked\" with\r\nyokes, and \"broken\" when very young, pretty much as men break\r\nhorses.--Our farmers are so satisfied with their utility and economy\r\nthat no argument would induce them to change.\r\n\r\nA very good yoke of oxen will cost when well broke, and about\r\nfive years old, if well matched and of good size' from 80 to 100\r\ndollars. They continue good, without accident, and with good usage,\r\nuntil ten years old; then they are usually fatted, and bring from\r\nthe butcher according to their size and fatness from 100 to 120\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWhether oxen are not more susceptible of _heat_ than horses, I\r\nam ignorant. My opinion is that they are. A circumstance in your\r\nclimate to be ascertained in forming an opinion of their comparative\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nWith respect to \"deep ploughing,\" a considerable change is producing\r\nin this state, in the opinion and practice of farmers in this\r\nrespect. Deep ploughing begins to be more general than formerly.\r\nI should state _five_ inches to be the most approved practice, on\r\nturning up the sord for corn. With respect to deepening it for other\r\ncrops, after the sord is broken, it depends upon the nature of the\r\ncrop and the resources of the farmer, and also the state of his\r\nsoil. My own rule is never to lay down land to grass until it has\r\nbeen turned up to the depth of _fourteen inches_. But my practice is\r\npeculiar, as I carry a regular succession of, 1st corn, 2d potatoes,\r\n3d carrots, 4th grain, 5th grass, over my whole farm; considering,\r\nas I do, that _carrots_ is of all farm products the most profitable,\r\nand using them as the test of the actual state of the depth of tilth\r\non my farm.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly when the depth of ploughing pass the old tilth, and\r\nenters upon the virgin soil, \"manuring\" must be in proportion to the\r\ndepth of the virgin soil, which you turn, otherwise you sacrifice\r\npresent crop to future crops;--a practice very discouraging to any\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the newspaper account of our last cattle show. A more\r\ndetailed statement will appear in our Repository.\r\n\r\n      Respectfully,\r\n\r\n        I am your humble servant,\r\n\r\n               JOSIAH QUINCY.\r\n\r\n  GEO. W. JEFFRIES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR MAPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter writer in the Albany Statesman, in giving an account of the\r\nNew York canal, says--\r\n\r\n\"I saw for the first time the famous ascersaccharinum, or sugar\r\nmaple. It grows spontaneously like all other trees of the forest,\r\nand is a most beautiful and stately tree.--It is said that each\r\ntree will produce from three to five pounds of sugar. An acre will\r\ncontain 30 trees, and a tree will be fit for use in 15 years, and\r\nwill probably continue so for two centuries. An orchard of ten acres\r\nwould produce annually two hogsheads and a half of sugar, which can\r\nbe made as good in all respects as the produce of the cane or the\r\nsweet beet. I speak from ocular observation and from taste. Mon.\r\nLe Ray, a very respectable and sensible land holder in Jefferson\r\ncounty, showed me at Washington Hall, in New York, a sample of\r\nmaple sugar, which I have never seen excelled, and which was raised\r\non his estates in that county; and I have been told by Mr. George\r\nParish, a most accomplished and public spirited gentleman, from St.\r\nLawrence county, that the inhabitants of that region not only supply\r\nthemselves with maple sugar for domestic uses, but have a surplus\r\nfor market. A plantation of maple trees of ten acres, beside being\r\nhighly ornamental and beneficial for pasture--besides the use of\r\nthe decayed trees for fuel, and the acquisition of excellent syrup\r\nand molasses, and a sufficiency of sugar, for family purposes, will\r\nyield a profit of $100 to the proprietor; and these operations are\r\ncarried on in the month of March, continue but a short time, and\r\ninterfere with no other business. The forests of the north and west,\r\nwill supply the other parts of the state with the best of sugar and\r\nmolasses through the great canals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Scoresby's Voyages.\r\n\r\nSURPRISING VIGOUR OF A WHALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June, 1812, one of the harpooners belonging to the\r\nResolution, of Whitby, under my command, struck a whale by the\r\nedge of a small floe of ice. Assistance being promptly afforded, a\r\nsecond boat's lines was attached to those of the _fast-boat_, in a\r\nfew minutes after the harpoon was disgraced. The remainder of the\r\nboats proceeded at some distance, in the direction the fish seemed\r\nto have taken. In about a quarter of an hour the fast-boat, to\r\nmy surprise, again made a signal for lines. As the ship was then\r\nwithin five minutes sail, we instantly steered towards the boat,\r\nwith the view of affording assistance by means of a spare boat we\r\nstill retained on board. Before we reached the place, however, we\r\nobserved four oars displayed in signal order, which by their number,\r\nindicated a most urgent necessity for assistance. Two or three men\r\nwere at the same time seen seated close by the stern, which was\r\nconsiderably elevated, for the purpose of keeping it down; while the\r\nbow of the boat, by the force of the line, was drawn down to the\r\nlevel of the sea, and the harpooner, by the friction of the line\r\nround the bollard, was enveloped in smoky obscurity. At length, when\r\nthe ship was scarcely 100 yards distant, we perceived preparations\r\nfor quitting the boat. The sailor's pea-jackets were cast upon the\r\nadjoining ice, the oars were thrown down, the crew leaped overboard,\r\nthe bow of the boat was buried in the water, the stern rose\r\nperpendicularly and then majestically disappeared. The harpooner\r\nhaving caused the end of the line to be fastened to the iron ring at\r\nthe boat's stern, was the means of its loss;[13] and a _tongue_ of\r\nthe ice, on which was a depth of several feet of water, kept the\r\nboat, by the pressure of the line against it, at such a considerable\r\ndistance, as prevented the crew from leaping upon the floe. Some\r\nof them were therefore put to the necessity of swimming for their\r\npreservation, but all of them succeeded in scrambling upon the ice,\r\nand were taken on board of the ship in a few minutes afterwards.\r\n\r\n  [13] \"Giving a whale the boat,\" as the voluntary sacrifice of a boat\r\n  is termed, is a scheme not unfrequently practised by the fisher when\r\n  in want of line. By submitting to this risk, he expects to gain\r\n  the fish, and still has the chance of recovering his boat and its\r\n  materials. It is only practised in open ice or at fields.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that it is an uncommon circumstance for a fish\r\nto require more than two boats' lines in such a situation; none of\r\nour harpooners, therefore, had any scruple in leaving the fast-boat,\r\nnever suspecting, after it had received the assistance of one boat\r\nwith six lines or upward, that it would need any more.\r\n\r\nSeveral ships being about us, there was a possibility that some\r\nperson might attack and make a prize of the whale, when it had\r\nso far escaped us, that we no longer retained any hold of it; as\r\nsuch, we sat all the sail the ship could safely sustain, and worked\r\nthrough several narrow and intricate channels in the ice, in the\r\ndirection I observed the fish had retreated. After a little time it\r\nwas descried by the people in the boats, at a considerable distance\r\nto the eastward; a general chase immediately commenced, and within\r\nthe space of an hour three harpoons were struck. We now imagined\r\nthe fish was secure, but our expectations were premature. The whale\r\nresolutely pushed beneath a large floe that had been recently\r\nbroken to pieces by the swell, and soon drew all the lines out of\r\nthe second fast-boat; the officer of which, not being able to get\r\nany assistance, tied the end of his line to a hammock of ice, and\r\nbroke it. Soon afterwards, the other two boats, still _fast_, were\r\ndragged against the broken floe, when one of the harpoons drew out.\r\nThe lines of only one boat, therefore, remained fast to the fish,\r\nand this with six or eight lines out, was dragged forward into the\r\nshattered floe with astonishing force. Pieces of ice, each of which\r\nwas sufficiently large to have answered the purpose of a mooring\r\nfor a ship were wheeled about by the strength of the whale; and\r\nsuch was the tension and elasticity of the line, that whenever it\r\nslipped clear of any mass of ice, after turning it round, into the\r\nspace between any two adjoining pieces, the boat and its crew flew\r\nforward through the crack, with the velocity of an arrow, and never\r\nfailed to launch several feet upon the first mass of ice that it\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nWhile we scoured the sea around the broken floe with the ship,\r\nand while the ice was attempted in vain by the boats, the whale\r\ncontinued to press forward in an easterly direction towards the sea.\r\nAt length, when 14 lines (about 1680 fathoms) were drawn from the\r\nfourth fast-boat, a slight entanglement of the line, broke it at the\r\nstem. The fish then again made its escape, taking along with it a\r\nboat and 28 lines. The united length of the lines was 6720 yards, or\r\nupwards of 3-3/4 English miles; value, with the boat, above 150_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThe obstruction of the sunken boat, to the progress of the fish,\r\nmust have been immense; and that of the lines likewise considerable;\r\nthe weight of lines alone, being 25 hundred weight.\r\n\r\nSo long as the fourth fast-boat, through the medium of its lines,\r\nretained its hold of the fish, we searched the adjoining sea with\r\nthe ship in vain; but, in a short time after the line was divided,\r\nwe got sight of the object of pursuit, at the distance of near two\r\nmiles to the eastward of the ice and boats, in the open sea. One\r\nboat only with lines, and two empty boats, were reserved by the\r\nship. Having, however, fortunately fine weather, and a fresh breeze\r\nof wind, we immediately gave chase under all sails; though, it must\r\nbe confessed, with the insignificant force by us, the distance of\r\nthe fish, and the rapidity of its flight considered, we had but\r\nvery small hopes of success. At length, after pursuing it five or\r\nsix miles, being at least nine miles from the place where it was\r\nstruck, we came up with it, and it seemed inclined to rest after its\r\nextraordinary exertions. The two dismantled or empty boats having\r\nbeen furnished with two lines each, (a very inadequate supply,)\r\nthey, together with the one in a good state of equipment, now made\r\nan attack upon the whale. One of the harpooners made a blunder; the\r\nfish saw the boat, took the alarm, and again fled. I now supposed it\r\nwould be seen no more; nevertheless, we chased nearly a mile in the\r\ndirection I imagined it had taken, and placed the boats to the best\r\nof my judgment, in the most advantageous situations. In this case\r\nwe were extremely fortunate. The fish rose near one of the boats,\r\nand was immediately harpooned. In a few minutes two more harpoons\r\nentered its back, and lances were plied against it with vigour and\r\nsuccess. Exhausted by its amazing exertions to escape, it yielded\r\nitself at length to its fate, received the piercing wounds of the\r\nlances without resistance, and finally died without a struggle. Thus\r\nterminated with success, an attack upon a whale, which exhibited the\r\nmost uncommon determination to escape from its pursuers, seconded\r\nby the most amazing strength of any individual whose capture I\r\never witnessed. After all, it may seem surprising, that it was not\r\na particularly large individual; the largest lamina of whalebone\r\nonly measuring 9 feet six inches, while those affording 12 feet\r\n_bone_ are not uncommon.[14] The quantity of line withdrawn from\r\nthe different boats engaged in the capture, was singularly great.\r\nIt amounted, all together, to 10,440 yards, or nearly six English\r\nmiles. Of these, 13 new lines were lost, together with the sunken\r\nboat; the harpoon connecting them to the fish having dropt out\r\nbefore the whale was killed.\r\n\r\n  [14] It has been frequently observed, that whales of this size are\r\n  the most active of the species; and that those of a very large\r\n  growth are, in general, captured with less trouble.\r\n\r\n\"_Fishers thrown overboard, by the jerking or sudden heeling of\r\nthe Boats, in consequence of blows from Whales._--On the third of\r\nJune 1811, a boat from the ship Resolution, commanded at the time\r\nby myself, put off in pursuit of a whale, and was rowed upon its\r\nback. At the moment that it was harpooned, it struck the side of\r\nthe boat a violent blow with its tail, the shock of which threw the\r\nboat-steerer to some distance into the water. A repetition of the\r\nblow projected the harpooner and line-manager in a similar way, and\r\ncompletely drenched the part of the crew remaining in the boat,\r\nwith the sprays. One of the men regained the boat, but as the fish\r\nimmediately sunk, and drew the boat away from the place, his two\r\ncompanions in misfortune were soon left far beyond the reach of\r\nassistance. The harpooner though a practised swimmer, felt himself\r\nso brushed and enervated by a blow he had received on the chest,\r\nthat he was totally incapacitated from giving the least support to\r\nhis fellow sufferer. The ship being happily near, a boat which had\r\nbeen lowered on the first alarm, arrived to their succour, at the\r\nmoment when the line-manager, who was unacquainted with the art of\r\nswimming, was on the point of sinking, to rise no more. Both the\r\nline-manager and harpooner were preserved; and the fish, after a few\r\nhours close pursuit, was subdued.\r\n\r\nA large whale harpooned from a boat belonging to the same ship,\r\nbecame the subject of a general chase on the 23d of June, 1809.\r\nBeing myself in the first boat which approached the fish, I struck\r\nmy harpoon at arm's length, by which we fortunately evaded a blow\r\nthat appeared to be aimed at the boat. Another boat then advanced,\r\nand another harpoon was struck, but not with the same result;\r\nfor the stroke was immediately returned by a tremendous blow from\r\nthe fishes tail. The boat was sunk by the shock; and, at the same\r\ntime, whirled round with such velocity, that the boat-steerer was\r\nprecipitated into the water, on the side next to the fish, and was\r\naccidentally carried down to a considerable depth by its tail.\r\nAfter a minute or so, he arose to the surface of the water and was\r\ntaken up, along with his companions, into my boat. A similar attack\r\nwas made on the next boat which came up; but the harpooner being\r\nwarned of the prior conduct of the fish, used such precautions,\r\nthat the blow, though equal in strength, took effect only in an\r\ninferior degree. The boat was slightly stove. The activity and skill\r\nof the lancers soon overcame this designing whale, accomplished\r\nits capture, and added its produce to the cargo of the ship. Such\r\nintentional mischief on the part of a whale, it must be observed, is\r\nan occurrence which is somewhat rare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     From a work, entitled, \"A Statistical, Commercial and Political\r\n     Description of Venezuela, Trinidad, Margarita, and Tobago.\"\r\n\r\nWILD HORSES AND ASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of horses which are wild in the forests, and do\r\nnot belong to any one. I was enabled to ascertain a fact, known to\r\nall who have travelled in this country. The horses live there in\r\nsocieties, generally to the number of five or six hundred, and even\r\none thousand: they occupy immense savannas, where it is dangerous to\r\ndisturb or try to catch them. In the dry season they are sometimes\r\nobliged to go two or three leagues, and even more, to find water.\r\nThey set out in regular ranks of four abreast, and thus form a\r\nprocession of an extent of a quarter of a league. There are always\r\nfive or six scouts, who precede the troop by about fifty paces. If\r\nthey perceive a man or jaguar (the American tiger,) they neigh,\r\nand the troop stops: if avoided, they continue their march; but,\r\nif an attempt be made to pass by their squadron, they leap on the\r\nimprudent traveller, and crush him under their feet. The best way\r\nis always to avoid them, and let them continue their route: they\r\nhave also a chief, who marches between the scouts and the squadron,\r\nand five or six other horses march on each side of the band,--a\r\nkind of adjutants, whose duty consists in hindering any individual\r\nfrom quitting the ranks. If any one attempts to straggle either\r\nfrom hunger or fatigue, he is bitten till he resumes his place, and\r\nthe culprit obeys with his head hanging down. Three or four chiefs\r\nmarch as the rear guard, at five or six paces from the troop. I\r\nhad often heard, at Trinidad, of this discipline among the wild\r\nhorses, and confess that I could scarcely believe it, but what I\r\nhave just stated is a fact which I witnessed twice on the banks of\r\nthe Guaripiche, where I encamped five days, for the express purpose\r\nof seeing those organized troops pass. I have met, on the shores of\r\nthe Orinoco, herds of fifty to a hundred wild oxen: a chief always\r\nmarched at the head, and another at the rear.\r\n\r\nThe people of the country have assured me, that the wild asses, when\r\nthey travel, observe the same discipline as the horses; but the\r\nmules, though they also live in troops, are continually fighting\r\nwith each other, and it has not been observed that they have any\r\nchief. They however unite, at the appearance of a common enemy, and\r\ndisplay still more trick and address than the horses, in avoiding\r\nthe snares which are laid for catching them, and also for escaping\r\nwhen taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREMIUMS FOR WORKMANSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boston, July 6._--Agreeably to custom, that useful and popular\r\nInstitution, the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association,\r\navailed themselves of this Anniversary, to distribute the MEDALS\r\nand PREMIUMS offered by them for exhibitions of superior workmanship\r\nand genius.--We think the occasion happily selected, as the\r\n_Mechanic Arts_ are one of the first sources of the _Independence_\r\nof a nation, and are free from any of the objections which are made\r\nto the undue increase of manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe Government Judges of Premiums, and Marshals, having breakfasted\r\nwith their President, proceeded at an early hour to the Washington\r\nGardens, where the examination of the articles presented, was\r\nfinished, and the awards made. The President then announced, that\r\nJudges had awarded the Medal, of the value of twelve dollars, to\r\nMessrs. Fearing and Emerson, harness makers, of this town, for\r\nthe best specimen of an entire Chaise Harness, silver plated, and\r\nentirely of American workmanship. The second premium of six dollars,\r\nwas also awarded to these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThat a Medal, of the value of twelve dollars, was awarded to Mr.\r\nThomas Burdle, of Boston, for the best made six-pannelled door; and\r\nthat the premium of six dollars was awarded to Henry Chulbrick, for\r\nthe next best.\r\n\r\nThat a Medal, of the value of twelve dollars, was awarded to Mr.\r\nAddison Bacon, Hanover-street, for the best made pair of Chaise\r\nWheels; and that a premium of six dollars was awarded to Mr. Oliver\r\nAmes, of Norton, for the next best.\r\n\r\nThat a Medal, of the value of eight dollars, was awarded to Wm.\r\nJordan, (an apprentice of Mr. Daniel Adams) for the best made Ship\r\nBlock, with two sheeves; and that the premium of four dollars was\r\nawarded to John B. Ingolls, (an apprentice of Messrs. Dupee and\r\nBadger) for the next best.\r\n\r\nThat a Medal, of the value of six dollars, was awarded to Peter\r\nAlbern of Boston, (an apprentice of Mr. David Peeler) for the best\r\nmade pair of Half Boots; and the premium of three dollars to Samuel\r\nB. Pope, (an apprentice to his father, in Quincy) for the second\r\nbest made pair.\r\n\r\nJohn J. Bickner, an apprentice of Attleborough, presented a\r\nBarrel, for which no premiums has been offered this year; and the\r\ngovernment, in consequence of the expense he had incurred by the\r\nmistake, directed the Treasurer to present him with the sum of seven\r\ndollars and seventy-five cents. The medals and premiums, were now\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nThe articles exhibited, were mostly of excellent workmanship, and it\r\nwas only regretted that the specimens were not more numerous, and\r\nwhich we trust they will be, should the premiums be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n     _From Johnson's Influence of Civil Life, Sedentary Habits and\r\n     Intellectual Refinements, or Human Health and Happiness, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parallel of enjoyment and suffering in drink._--The water drinker\r\nglides tranquilly through life, without much exhileration or\r\ndepression, and escapes many diseases to which he would otherwise\r\nbe subject. The wine drinker experiences short, but vivid periods\r\nof rapture, and long intervals of gloom; he is also more subject to\r\ndisease. The balance of enjoyment, then, turns decidedly in favour\r\nof the water drinker, leaving out his temporal _prosperity_ and\r\nfuture anticipations; and the nearer we keep to his regimen, the\r\nhappier we shall be. Here, however, as is in all other things, there\r\nis a certain latitude within the range of health and happiness which\r\nthe wise man and the philosopher will occasionaly travel round, but\r\nnot exceed.--The _native fountain_ is in the centre, and from it\r\nour eccentric divergences should be narrowly watched and carefully\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n_Density, weight, &c. of the earth._--From the experiment of\r\nMaskelyne, and the calculations of Hutton, Cavendish, Laplace, &c.\r\nit appears, that considering the specific gravity of water as unity,\r\nthe mean density of the earth would be according to Hutton, 4.95,\r\nor according to Cavendish, 5.48. The mean most commonly adopted is\r\n5.4. Taking this as our ground work, we may now proceed to that most\r\nsingular question of _weighing_ the earth.\r\n\r\nAssuming 7920 miles as the mean diameter of the earth, the number of\r\ncubic miles will be 239,979,311,961. Now each cubic mile contains\r\n147,197,952,000 cubic feet; also every cubic foot of water weighs\r\n1000 avoirdupoise ounces.\r\n\r\nHence a cubic mile of water will weigh 4,107,085,714 tons, and\r\nconsequently a globe of water of equal dimensions with our earth\r\nwould weigh 985,594,985,000,000,000,000 tons, and that multiplied by\r\nthe calculated density 5.4, gives 5,322,212,919,540,000,000,000 tons\r\nfor the weight of our earth.\r\n\r\n_Fruit._--The Poughkeepsie Herald states, that Mr. Joseph Waddle,\r\nof the town of Washington, Dutchess county, has sold, at the New\r\nYork market, during the last six weeks, the produce of ten apple\r\ntrees for the almost incredible sum of three hundred and sixty\r\ndollars--they were of a species called Summer Russets; the quantity\r\nfifty barrels. These apples grew on ten trees, which altogether\r\noccupy less than one quarter of an acre of ground. When the apples\r\nwere first gathered last fall they filled fifty-three barrels, and\r\non being picked over this spring, preparatory to sending them to\r\nmarket, they were reduced to fifty barrels.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Anecdote._----Furius Cresinus, as mentioned by Pliny,\r\nthe Roman historian, was originally a slave. Having been made\r\na freedman, he purchased a small spot of ground, from which he\r\nobtained, through his unwearied industry, much finer crops than\r\nmany of the neighbours, who had larger farms. This excited general\r\nenvy, which his enemies carried to such a length as to accuse him\r\nof employing magic charms to render his own grounds fertile and to\r\nimpoverish heirs. The _Edile_ caused him to be summoned to appear\r\nand answer the charge before the people of Rome. Crecinus obeyed the\r\nmandate, accompanied by his daughter, a fresh and healthy coloured\r\ngirl--charms which appeared to greater advantage from the symplicity\r\nof her dress. The accused also brought with him the tools and\r\ninstruments of his profession. They were in excellent condition. His\r\nmattocks were remarkably heavy, his plough was of an enormous size,\r\nand his cattle were all sound and fat. \"Behold!\" said this truly\r\ndignified and indignant farmer, \"behold my whole magical equipage!\r\nbehold the charms which I have recourse to! There are others,\r\nindeed, which I am not capable of producing before you; I mean the\r\nsweat of my brow, and incessant toils both by day and night.\" This\r\nnative eloquence decided the matter; he was honourably acquitted by\r\nthe unanimous voice of a numerous and applauding assembly.\r\n\r\nA mechanic in the North has invented a machine for seminaries,\r\nwhich, by means of steam, not only warms the room, but _flogs all\r\nthe boys_ \"on a graduated scale,\" according to their offences.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Line._--This noted Irish physician, who died of the small pox\r\nat the age of 85, built a house in a peculiar manner, so as to have\r\nthe full benefit of the circulation of the air. Every window had\r\nanother opposite to it, none of which he ever suffered to be shut\r\nor glazed. The room in which he slept had four open windows, two on\r\neach side of his bed. It was remarked that, for fifty years together\r\nnobody died in his house. He carried this doctrine to such an\r\nexcess, as to contend that no house could be wholesome, where a dog\r\ncould not get in under the door and a bird at the window. Upon his\r\ndeath, his son had all the windows glazed; soon after which, several\r\npersons were _buried out of the house_.\r\n\r\nThe late king of England concurred a little in this practice of\r\nDr. Line. In the rooms where he and his family resided, he never\r\nsuffered a carpet to be laid; and in the chimney places allowed but\r\na very scanty portion of fire--barely enough to aid the circulation\r\nof the air and prevent damps.\r\n\r\n_Internal Improvements._--In consequence of the facilities afforded\r\nby that part of the great canal which is completed, Plaster of\r\nParis, or Gypsum, which abounds in the western parts of New York,\r\nis now selling at Utica at from $1.50 to $2.00 per ton, and it is\r\nsupposed that any part of that great tract of country lying on the\r\nHudson, may be supplied with it at from 4 to 5 dollars! Onondaga\r\nsalt will be sold at Albany at from 31 to 37 cents per bushel; and\r\na bushel of wheat, which formerly cost 44 cents to transport it to\r\nthat city, will be brought there from the interiour, for the small\r\nsum of 5 cents. In truth, this canal when finished, will, seemingly,\r\nbring the most remote places, even the most distant points of the\r\ngreat lakes, into the neighbourhood of the port of New York.\r\n\r\n_The Coronation of George IV._ which is to take place August, 1st,\r\nis to be conducted on the most economical scale, and is not to cost\r\nmore than about $450.000!! The price of a coronation dress for a\r\npeer and peeress is estimated at about $3.600.\r\n\r\n_Marriage Promise._--In Somerset county, New Jersey, a young lady\r\nlately received the sum of 1250 dollars damages, for a breach of\r\npromise of marriage.\r\n\r\n_Mobile_ is becoming a place of great importance; about 10,000 bales\r\nof cotton have been shipped from this port in the present year, and\r\n6,000 remained on hand. This shews an increase of 10,000 bales since\r\nlast year; and it is calculated that at least 10,000 more will be\r\nshipped next year than in the present.\r\n\r\n_The number of letters_ delivered daily by the post in Paris is, on\r\nan average, 32,000; of journals, 18,000. In London, the average of\r\nletters is 133,000, and journals 26,000.\r\n\r\n_Cincinnati, June 15._--On Saturday last, in digging the well of Mr.\r\nWright, near Harrison, in this county, near a mile from White-Water,\r\nand about 14 feet from the surface, in a bed of rounded limestone\r\npebbles, a living frog was dug up, which in a short time, hopped\r\naway as nimbly as if he had been but a year old. There are trees\r\ncontiguous, and in lower ground, more than 500 years old, which have\r\nevidently taken the places of others of equal growth; so that this\r\nfrog had probably lain buried for 1000 years.\r\n\r\n_Mean temperature of the Earth._--According to Laplace, any actual\r\ndiminution of the mean temperature of the earth would be detected by\r\na diminution of the length of the day.--It appears by computation,\r\nthat one degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer would make an alteration\r\nof nearly one second in the length of a day, and four or five\r\nminutes in that of a year.\r\n\r\n_Heat._--The effect of heat in expanding iron is strongly shown by a\r\ngate of that material in this town.--In the cool of the morning it\r\nshuts with a considerable spare space, (in the winter perhaps an 8th\r\nof an inch) in the middle of a hot day the joints touch, and some\r\nforce is necessary to close it. The gate is about 3-1/2 feet wide.\r\n\r\n  [_Boston Pal._\r\n\r\n\"Let not sleep,\" says Pythagoras, \"fall upon thy eyes, till thou\r\nhast thrice reviewed the transactions of the past day. Where have\r\nI turned aside from rectitude? What have I been doing? What have I\r\nleft undone which I ought to have done? Begin thus from the first\r\nact, and proceed; in conclusion, for the ill which thou hast done,\r\nseek repentance, and gratitude for the good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To preserve Cattle from Disease in the Winter._--When cattle are\r\nkept out in the winter, it is recommended as a useful practice to\r\nrub some tar at the root of the horn, which prevents the wet from\r\ngetting between the root and the skin; and it is said, contributes\r\nso preserve the health of the animal, and to keep it free from\r\nvarious diseases to which it may otherwise be liable.\r\n\r\n_Rules for Milking Cows._--Cows should be milked three times a day,\r\nif fully fed, throughout the summer, and _great caution should\r\nbe exercised by the persons employed, to draw the milk from them\r\ncompletely_, not only to encrease the quantity of produce, but\r\nto preserve its quality. Any portion which may be left in the\r\nudder, seems gradually to be absorbed into the system, and no\r\nmore is formed than enough to supply what is taken away; and by\r\nthe continuance of the same mode, a yet further dimunition of the\r\nsecretion takes place, until at length scarcely any is produced.\r\nThis last mode of milking is always practised when it is intended\r\nthat a cow should be rendered dry.\r\n\r\n_Additional quantity of Milk to be gained by keeping Milch Cows in\r\nthe house._--In the management of cows, a warm stable is highly\r\nnecessary; and currying them like horses, not only affords them\r\npleasure, but makes them give their milk more freely. They ought\r\nalways to be kept clean, laid dry, and have plenty of good sweet\r\nwater to drink. Cows treated in this manner, have given ten gallons\r\nof milk at a time, when within ten days of calving.\r\n\r\n_To prevent Cows from contracting bad habits while milking._--Cows\r\nshould be always treated with great gentleness, and soothed by mild\r\nusage, especially when young and ticklish, or when the paps are\r\ntender, in which case the udder ought to be fomented with warm water\r\nbefore milking, and touched with the greatest gentleness, otherwise\r\nthe cow will be in danger of contracting bad habits, becoming\r\nstubborn and unruly, and retaining her milk ever after. A cow never\r\nlets down her milk pleasantly to the person she dreads or dislikes.\r\nThe udder and paps, should always be washed with clean water before\r\nmilking; but care should be taken that none of that water be\r\nadmitted into the milking pail.\r\n\r\nSir George M'Kenzie has discovered that oil rubbed upon the stems\r\nand branches of fruit trees destroys insects, and increases the\r\nfruit buds. Mr. John Linning, has added to the discovery, by using\r\nit successfully upon the stems of carnations, to guard them against\r\nthe depredations of the earwig. The coarsest oil will suit, and only\r\na small quantity is required.\r\n\r\n_To prevent smut in wheat._--Take four quarts of good lye, or\r\na sufficient quantity to wet your seed, and add to it a bushel\r\nof wheat, stirring till the whole is alike wet, then sow it\r\nimmediately, as the strong lye will injure the seed if delayed. The\r\nlye may be as strong as you can bare to sow without injury to the\r\nhand. A little tallow applied to the hand will prevent injury from\r\nthe lye. I have continued this practice 12 years out of 20; and have\r\nnever known it to fail of success. I have frequently made use of\r\nsmutty wheat for seed, and found my crops perfectly free from smut.\r\nMuch depends on having the lye sufficiently strong to take off the\r\nfuz on wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSIAH BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nBerlin, April 26, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For preserving Eggs._--In March, put about half a pound of\r\nquick lime in a stone or earthen pot, and add a gallon of cold\r\nwater;--next day fill the pot with new eggs, tie a paper over it and\r\nput the pot in a cool place. The eggs will be found perfectly good\r\nafter being kept a year.\r\n\r\nIt is quite necessary to keep lime in the walks of your hens, as it\r\ncauses their laying eggs throughout the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTED FROM THE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS OF C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following piece was handed about in manuscript, about the year\r\n1776, and I do not know that it has been ever printed till now. It\r\nwas said to be the production of the Rev. THOMAS COOMBE, a native\r\nPennsylvanian, and about that time a clergyman of the Episcopal\r\nChurch, in this city. C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HYMN TO RESIGNATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh! from that high and holy sphere,\r\n      Where, thron'd in light, you dwell,\r\n    Sweet maid, in all thy charms descend\r\n      To gild my humble cell.\r\n\r\n    Thy presence heightens every bliss,\r\n      Draws out the sting of wo,\r\n    Allures to brighter worlds above,\r\n      And makes a heaven below.\r\n\r\n    The pilgrim, roving all night long,\r\n        Through dreary tracts forlorn,\r\n    Oft sighs, oppress'd, and sighs again,\r\n      The wish'd return of morn.\r\n\r\n    As I in sorrow's gloomy night,\r\n      Condemn'd awhile to stray,\r\n    Look up with ardent eye to heav'n,\r\n      And ask the devious way,\r\n\r\n    O! screen me from surrounding ills,\r\n      Let dangers ne'er annoy,\r\n    The arrow that in darkness flies,\r\n      Commissioned to destroy.\r\n\r\n    Inconstant as the idle wind,\r\n      That sports with every flow'r,\r\n    When earthly friends by turns drop off,\r\n      Friends of our brighter hour;\r\n\r\n    Do thou, mild cherub, fill my breast,\r\n      With all that's good and wise,\r\n    Snatch me from earth's tumultuous scenes,\r\n      And lead me to the skies.\r\n\r\n    There kindred spirits ne'er deceive;\r\n      Soul mingles there with soul;\r\n    Sweet Sympathy and Truth are there,\r\n      And Love cements the whole.\r\n\r\n    More welcome to this sorrowing heart,\r\n      Oh, pensive queen, thy strain,\r\n    Than all the joys mad Riot gives\r\n      To sooth the clamorous train.\r\n\r\n    You shade the poor man's evening walk\r\n      With wreaths of endless green,\r\n    And, when the lamp of life declines,\r\n      You tend the last dread scene.\r\n\r\n    Oh! then from heaven, thy holy sphere,\r\n      Where, thron'd in light you dwell,\r\n    Come, Resignation, sainted maid,\r\n      And gild my humble cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following little poem was written by JOHN BYRON, a minor English\r\npoet, who died at Manchester, in the year 1763, aged 72. In his\r\n23d year, he wrote the beautiful pastoral of Colin and Phebe, on\r\nwhich his poetick reputation is principally founded. It appeared in\r\nthe eighth volume of the Spectator; and many of your readers will\r\nremember, what has been so generally known and admired.\r\n\r\n    My time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,\r\n    When Phebe went with me wherever I went;\r\n    Ten thousand sweet pleasures I felt in my breast:\r\n    Sure never fond shepherd like Colin was blest! &c.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined extract, it is believed, is not so familiar; and for\r\nthat reason, as you must doubtless wish to exclude from your poetick\r\ncorner whatever is trite and common-place, whether _professedly_\r\noriginal, or selected from old or distant writers, it is hoped,\r\nthough a small matter, it will not prove altogether unacceptable. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAU AND THE BEDLAMITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A patient in Bedlam, that did pretty well,\r\n    Was permitted sometimes to go out of his cell;\r\n    One day, when they gave him that freedom, he spy'd\r\n    A beauish young spark with a sword by his side;\r\n    With a huge silver hilt, and a scabbard of steel,\r\n    That swung at due length from his hip to his heel.\r\n\r\n    When he saw him advance on the gallery ground,\r\n    The Bedlamite ran, and survey'd him all round;\r\n    While a waiter supprest the young captain's alarm,\r\n    With, \"You need not to fear, sir, he'll do you no harm.\"\r\n    At the last he broke out--\"Aye, a very fine show!\r\n    May I ask him one question?\"--\"What's that?\" said the beau?\r\n\r\n    \"Pray what is that long, dangling, cumbersome thing,\r\n    That you seem to be ty'd to with riband and string?\"\r\n    \"Why, that is my sword.\"--\"And what is it to do?\"\r\n    \"Kill my enemies, master, by running them through.\"\r\n    \"Kill your enemies! Kill a fool's head of your own;\r\n    They'll die of themselves, if you'll let them alone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the London Literary Gazette, April 22.)\r\n\r\nSILENT WORSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though glorious, O God! must thy temple have been,\r\n      On the day of its first dedication,\r\n    When the Cherubim's wings, widely waving, were seen\r\n      On high, o'er the ark's holy station.\r\n\r\n    When even the chosen of Levi, though skill'd\r\n      To minister, standing before Thee,\r\n    Retir'd from the cloud which the temple then fill'd,\r\n      And thy glory made Israel adore Thee:\r\n\r\n    Though awfully grand was thy Majesty then;\r\n      Yet the worship thy gospel discloses,\r\n    Less splendid in pomp to the vision of men,\r\n      Far surpasses the ritual of Moses.\r\n\r\n    And by whom was the ritual for ever repeal'd?\r\n      But by Him, unto whom it was given\r\n    To enter the Oracle, where is reveal'd,\r\n      Not the cloud but the brightness of Heaven.\r\n\r\n    Who, having once enter'd, hath shown us the way,\r\n      O Lord! how to worship before Thee;\r\n    Not with shadowy forms of that earlier day;\r\n      But in _spirit_ and _truth_ to adore Thee!\r\n\r\n    This, this is the worship the Saviour made known,\r\n      When she, of Samaria, found him\r\n    By the patriarch's well, sitting weary, alone,\r\n      With the stillness of noon-tide around him.\r\n\r\n    How sublime, yet how simple the homage he taught\r\n      To her, who inquir'd by that fountain,\r\n    If JEHOVAH at Solyma's shrine would be sought?\r\n      Or ador'd on Samaria's mountain.\r\n\r\n    Woman, believe me, the hour is near,\r\n      When he, if ye rightly would hail him,\r\n    Will neither be worship'd _exclusively_ here,\r\n      Nor yet at the altar of Salem.\r\n\r\n    For God is a Spirit! and they, who aright\r\n      Would perform the pure worship he loveth,\r\n    In the heart's holy temple will seek, with delight,\r\n      That Spirit the Father approveth.\r\n\r\n    And many that prophecy's truth can declare,\r\n      Whose bosoms have livingly known it;\r\n    Whom God hath instructed to worship him\r\n         there,\r\n      And convinc'd that his mercy will own it.\r\n\r\n    The temple that Solomon built to his name,\r\n      Now lives but in history's story;\r\n    Extinguish'd long since, is its altar's bright\r\n         flame,\r\n      And vanish'd each glimpse of its glory.\r\n\r\n    But the Christian, made wise by a wisdom divine,\r\n      Though all human fabrics may falter,\r\n    Still finds in his heart a far holier shrine,\r\n      Where the fire burns unquench'd on the altar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the Illinois Gazette.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"What's the news,\" said a Quidnunc to Paddy M'Shane,\r\n    \"Of our _foreign relations_--and what about Spain?\"\r\n    \"Our _foreign relations_,\" cried Pat, with a tear,\r\n    \"Och! they're hanging them up by the dozen, my dear!\"\r\n    p?\r\n\r\n    O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\n            9 o'clock. 12 o'clock. 3 o'clock.\r\n  June 26,      --         --         76\r\n       27,      72         74         76\r\n       28,      75         78         80\r\n       29,      76         81         85\r\n       30,      82         87         90\r\n  July  1,      85         89         90\r\n        3,      78         81         84\r\n        4,      77         80         83\r\n        5,      81         85         88\r\n        6,      82         87         90\r\n        7,      82         86         85\r\n        8,      79         81         81\r\n       10,      77         81         82\r\n       11,      78         81         84\r\n       12,      78         81         85\r\n       13,      81         86         89\r\n       14,      83         78         76\r\n       15,      74         76         78\r\n       17,      74         78         78\r\n       18,      77         80         82\r\n       19,      78         81         85\r\n       20,      79         81         81\r\n       21,      79         77         76\r\n       22,      73         75         76\r\n       24,      71         73         76\r\n       25,      74         --         --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK NOTE EXCHANGE,\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PHILADELPHIA--_July 27th, 1820_.\r\n\r\n                               Per cent Disc't.\r\n  U.
