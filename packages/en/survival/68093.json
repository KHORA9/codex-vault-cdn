last census, a population pressing close\r\nupon fifty Millions. Every one of this vast number is individually\r\ninterested in the milk question. What is true of perhaps no other\r\nelement of food and nourishment, milk is consumed in some form by all,\r\nold and young. It is because of this necessarily universal personal\r\ninterest in milk that the publishers offer this volume which aims to\r\nshow all how to obtain the best milk, plenty of it, and at the cheapest\r\nrates. The book embraces the experience and advice of able, well known\r\nwriters—such, for example, as Professor Slade, of Harvard College, and\r\nHenry E. Alvord—elicited in response to propositions presented by the\r\nPublishers for articles upon the subject. The editorial supervision of\r\nthe work has been in the hands of Col. Mason C. Weld and Professor Manly\r\nMiles—recognized authorities on Dairy Matters—who would have included\r\nmany other valuable and interesting papers submitted, were it not that\r\nthey would have made the volume too bulky. Mr. Orange Judd has added a\r\nleaf from his personal experience.\r\n\r\nThe topics treated are only those legitimately connected with the\r\nsubject, yet they cover a wide field, and will prove of great interest to\r\nall occupied in the culture of the soil, while as a handbook and guide\r\nto those who keep one or more family cows it must be of almost daily\r\npractical use. The prominent subjects, such as soiling, stabling, care of\r\nmanure, the tillage of the soil, the cultivation of various crops, care\r\nof the cow and of the calf, are each treated in detail, and yet there\r\nis so great a variety and such genuine personal experience and sincere\r\nconviction on the part of each writer, that his or her way is the best\r\nway—as indeed it may be, under the circumstances—that there is little or\r\nnothing of sameness or repetition in the book, but the reader’s interest\r\nis sustained to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery farmer is ordinarily supposed to keep several cows, and there is\r\nno reason why most families in villages and very many in cities should\r\nnot possess at least one. Good milk affords the best of nourishment for\r\nyoung children, and goes a long way in saving butchers’ bills, and in\r\nthe preparation of palatable nourishing food of many varieties. Two to\r\nfive families, according to age and number, can readily unite in having\r\none cow kept, dividing the milk and expenses, and thus always have\r\ngood, pure, rich milk at very moderate cost. The suitable refuse from\r\nthe kitchens of three or four families would very much reduce the cost\r\nof purchased food. In rural villages, summer pasturage can be obtained\r\nnear at hand, which, with a daily feed of good meal will furnish a large\r\nsupply of rich milk at a low cost. A boy can be secured at a small price\r\nto drive the cow to the pasture in the morning, and return her at night\r\nto the stable. A stable or stall can always be obtained at a trifling\r\nrent, and be kept clean. There are plenty of gardeners or farmers who\r\nwill gladly take the manure away so frequently as to prevent it being a\r\nnuisance, or disagreeable.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that all residents of villages, manufacturing towns,\r\netc., can, by arrangements like the above, secure an abundant supply of\r\npure, rich, fresh, healthful milk at less than three cents per quart, and\r\nat the same time add greatly to their home comforts, and preserve the\r\nhealth if not the lives of their little ones.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1880, the publishers of this volume offered prizes for three\r\nessays on keeping one cow, indicating at the same time their scope. Some\r\nextracts from the explanatory remarks accompanying this offer may fitly\r\noutline an introduction to the work.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons who possess but one cow is far larger than those\r\nwho have ten or more. No doubt many others, living outside of closely\r\nbuilt cities, would gladly lessen the cost of supporting their families,\r\nand at the same time add to their comforts, and even luxuries, by keeping\r\na cow, did they know how to keep one. There is a general notion that\r\nkeeping a cow requires a pasture. If a pasture is not necessary, they\r\ndo not know how to get along without one. Dairymen and farmers learn\r\nhow to treat herds as a part of general farm management, or in books on\r\nthe subject. There are books on cows, but none on one cow. It is not a\r\nquestion of dairy farming, but of dairy gardening. The offer was made\r\nto elicit information to enable one to keep a single cow with the best\r\npossible results. The main points to be considered are: the stabling\r\nor housing of the cow; the yard room she requires, and the storage or\r\ndisposal of her manure; the least area of land that can be safely set\r\napart for the support of the cow, and how can that land be best managed.\r\nIt is to be assumed that the land will be made to produce all that it\r\nwill profitably yield, which will bring up the question of manure and\r\nfertilizers, of course considering that produced by the cow herself. What\r\nproportion of the produce of the land is to be cured for winter? How much\r\nfood must be bought, and what? How is the cow to be fed, and in every\r\nrespect how treated so as to give the best returns to her owner? What\r\nshould be done at calving time and afterwards? milking, etc. In short,\r\nthe problem is—given a good cow, how to get the best possible returns\r\nfrom the least possible portion of the land through the agency of the cow.\r\n\r\nThis, we think, is satisfactorily answered, if not by any one writer,\r\ncertainly by several combined.\r\n\r\nWe place as a frontispiece the portrait of a most famous and excellent\r\ncow—not so much for her beauty or on account of her breed, but as a model\r\nof a dairy cow, and one which may be carried in the mind when purchasing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING ONE COW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY COW AT THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. G. BOURINOT, OTTAWA, CANADA.\r\n\r\n    She’s broad in her hips and long in her rump,\r\n    A straight and flat back without ever a hump,\r\n    She’s wide in her lips and calm in her eyes,\r\n    She’s fine in her shoulders and thin in her thighs,\r\n    She’s sleight in her neck and small in her tail,\r\n    She’s wide in her breast and good at the pail;\r\n    She’s fine in her bone and silky of skin,\r\n    She’s a grazier without and a butcher within.\r\n\r\n                                        —MILBURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of providing for the wants of a cow, but in all\r\ncases it is absolutely necessary, in order to obtain the best results,\r\nthat certain rules be followed with regard to the treatment the cow\r\nreceives. She must be fed and milked at regular times, be kept thoroughly\r\nclean, have plenty of fresh air and water, and her food composed of those\r\nsubstances that will keep her always in good condition, do away with the\r\nmilk bill, reduce the grocer’s account, and contribute greatly to the\r\nhealth and comfort of the family. I have tried various things, and have\r\nfound fresh grass or fodder, provender, bran, oil-cake, mangels, and hay,\r\nthe best bill of fare for “Daisy” or “Buttercup.” Avoid brewer’s slops or\r\ngrains as you would poison, for although they increase the flow of milk,\r\nit is thin and blue, the butter white and tasteless, and after a time the\r\ncow’s teeth will blacken and decay. I was told the other day by a very\r\nintelligent dairyman that after feeding his cows one season on brewer’s\r\ngrains he was obliged to sell his whole herd.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARD, STABLE, AND RATIONS.\r\n\r\nMr. Geo. E. Waring, Jr., in his “Ogden Farm Papers,” says he expects\r\nto be able to feed a cow from May fifteenth to November fifteenth from\r\nhalf an acre of ground, but the average citizen had better not attempt\r\nit, but keep his half acre to raise vegetables and fruit, buying the\r\nfood required to keep his cow. A cow can be made very profitable if kept\r\nin the following way; First, as to the accommodation required, a yard\r\nfifteen feet by fifteen, and a stable or cow-shed arranged as in the\r\nfollowing plan. _A_, manure shed; _B_, bin for dried earth; _C_, cow;\r\n_D_, store-room; _E_, window for putting in hay; _F_, door; _G_, trap\r\nto loft; _H_, feeding trough. Have her food provided as follows: into\r\na common pail put one quart of provender (“provender” is oats and peas\r\nground together, and can be purchased at any feed store), one-quarter\r\npound of oil-cake, then fill the pail nearly full of bran and pour\r\nboiling water over the whole; stir well with a stick, and put it away\r\ncovered with an old bit of carpet until feeding time; give her that mess\r\ntwice a day. Have her dinner from June to November consist of grass or\r\nfodder cut and brought in twice a week by some farmer or market gardener\r\nin exchange for her manure and sour milk. In Montreal, grass and fodder\r\nare brought to market by the “Habatants,” and sold in bundles. As to\r\nquantity, a good big armful will be sufficient, and it is more healthful\r\nfor the cow if it is a little wilted. In the winter hay and mangels are\r\nto be fed in place of the grass and fodder. She should also have salt\r\nwhere she can take a lick when so minded, and fresh water three times\r\na day. The yard should be kept clean by scraping up the manure every\r\nmorning into the little shed at the end of the stable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—STABLE AND YARD.]\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the food required to keep one cow through the\r\nentire year:\r\n\r\n    Hay, the best, two tons, at $10 per ton       $20.00\r\n    200 pounds of Oil-cake, at $4 per 100 pounds    8.00\r\n    800 pounds of Provender, at $1 per 100 pounds   8.00\r\n    Half a ton of Bran, at $12 per ton              6.00\r\n    One ton of Mangels                              5.00\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                  $47.00\r\n\r\nYour cow will require the following “trousseau”:\r\n\r\n    One five-gallon stone churn                    $1.25\r\n    One and a half dozen milk pans, at $2           3.00\r\n    One milk pail and strainer                       .60\r\n    One butter bowl (wooden)                         .50\r\n    One paddle and print                             .20\r\n    Two wooden pails for feed                        .40\r\n    One card                                         .25\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                   $6.20\r\n        Cost of a good cow                         40.00\r\n                                                   -----\r\n        Interest at 6 per cent                     $3.69\r\n\r\nAny ordinary family will take from a milkman at least one quart a day. We\r\nin Ottawa pay eight cents per quart, making per year (365 × 8,) $29.20.\r\n\r\nIt is a very poor cow that will not average five pounds of butter a week\r\nfor forty weeks, and that at twenty-five cents per pound, that is 40\r\n(weeks) × 5 (pounds), × 25 (cents), equals 50 (dollars).\r\n\r\nSo the account stands thus:\r\n\r\n    Butter                                        $50.00\r\n    Milk                                           29.20\r\n                                                  ------\r\n                                                  $79.20\r\n    Cost of food for one year            $47.00 }\r\n    Interest on cow and trousseau          3.69 }  50.69\r\n                                                  ------\r\n        Profit                                    $28.51\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND AND CROPS.\r\n\r\nI have found that two acres of land is the least possible area that will\r\nprovide cow-food for the entire year, and that should be divided thus:\r\nOne acre for hay, the other for fodder and mangels. If you have no land\r\nalready seeded down, plow up your acre, sow clover and timothy, six\r\npounds, of each. In May, when the grass has fairly started, top-dress\r\nit with two bushels of land plaster; if you can apply it just before a\r\nrain it is the best time. The first year you will have all clover hay,\r\nand it must be cut before the second blossom comes; if not cut early\r\nenough, the stalks become tough and woody, and are wasted by the cow.\r\nThe second year, if top-dressed in the fall with the manure collected\r\nduring the summer, you will have a fine crop of timothy, and if the land\r\nwas good for anything you can cut hay from it for three years by giving\r\nit a little manure every fall. As early as the ground will admit, sow\r\nsome peas and oats; one bushel of each will plant one-third of an acre.\r\nPeas do well on old sod, and are the best crop to plant on new ground.\r\nIn about six weeks you can commence cutting it for fodder, and it should\r\ngive the cow two good meals a day until corn comes in. L. B. Arnold, in\r\n“American Dairying,” says of corn: “When too thickly planted its stems\r\nand leaves are soft and pale, its juices thin and poor. If sown thin or\r\nin drills, so that the air and light and heat of the sun can reach it,\r\nand not fed until nearly its full size, it is a valuable soiling plant.”\r\nNow Mr. Waring, in “Farming for Profit,” says: “It is a common mistake\r\nwhen the corn is planted in drills to put in so little seed that the\r\nstalks grow large and strong, when they are neglected by the cattle, the\r\nleaves only being consumed. There should be forty grains at least to the\r\nfoot of row, which will take from four to six bushels to the acre, but\r\nthe result will fully justify the outlay, as the corn standing so close\r\nin the row will grow fine and thick.” My experience tells me that Mr.\r\nWaring is right; any way, my cow will not eat the coarse stalks which\r\nwill grow when the corn is planted too thin.\r\n\r\nThe one-third acre reserved for mangels, must be the perfection of\r\nrichness, well drained, and manured. If the soil is deep, you can plant\r\nthem on the flat, but if the soil is shallow, plant them on ridges, the\r\nridges thirty inches apart (I always plant them in that way); then thin\r\nout the plants to fifteen inches apart. Ten to twelve hundred bushels may\r\nbe grown on an acre, but the ground must be properly prepared. In storing\r\nthem, they require to be very carefully handled, as the least bruise\r\nhastens decay, and we want to keep them fresh and good until April, when\r\nour cow ought to give us a calf.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEANING THE CALF.\r\n\r\nI thought I had tried almost everything relating to the care of cows, but\r\nwhen I undertook to wean a five-weeks’-old calf, I found my education\r\nin that respect sadly neglected. I asked a farmer’s wife how I was to\r\nmanage. “Oh,” she said, “just dip your fingers in the milk, and let the\r\ncalf suck them a few times, and it will soon learn to put its nose in the\r\npail and drink.” It sounded simple enough, so I took my pail and started\r\nfor the barn, where that wretched animal slopped me all over with milk,\r\nbunted me round and round the pen, until I was black and blue, sucked\r\nthe skin off my finger, and wouldn’t drink. After trying at intervals\r\nfor two days, the calf was getting thin, and so was I. In despair, I\r\nleft the pail of milk, giving that calf a few words of wholesome advice.\r\nWhen I went back two hours after, the calf was standing over the empty\r\npail, with an expression on its face, that I translated into an inquiry,\r\nas to why I hadn’t left that pail there before. I have weaned several\r\ncalves since then, but have never had any trouble. Leave them with the\r\ncow three or four days, then take a little milk and hold the calf’s nose\r\nin the pail; it must open its mouth or smother, and when once it tastes\r\nthe milk, will soon learn to drink.[1] When it is a week old, commence\r\nfeeding with oil-cake, skim-milk and molasses. Into an old two-pound\r\npeach can, I put one tablespoonful of oil-cake and one of molasses, fill\r\nup the can with boiling water, and set it on the stove until thoroughly\r\ncooked. That quantity will be its allowance for one day, mixed with\r\nskim-milk. The next week, give it that quantity at each meal, and the\r\nnext week, twice that. The calf will then be four weeks old, and the\r\nbutcher ought to give you a price for it that will pay for all trouble\r\nand the family milk bill while the cow was dry. It does not pay to raise\r\ncalves where you only keep one cow. (Mr. Cochrane, the owner of the\r\ncelebrated cow “Duchess of Airdrie,” told me the other morning that last\r\nyear he sold a calf of her’s to an English gentleman for four thousand\r\nguineas (twenty thousand dollars). I think it would pay to have a wet\r\nnurse if one had a calf like that). A tablespoonful of lime-water put in\r\nthe milk now and then will prevent the calf from “scouring,” a complaint\r\nvery common among calves brought up by hand. I believe that winter rye\r\nmakes a valuable soiling plant, but I have never tried it.\r\n\r\n    [1] It is better, as a rule, not to allow the calf to suck at\r\n    all. Aptness in learning to drink is influenced by heredity.\r\n    Calves from ancestors that have not been allowed to suck, learn\r\n    to drink more readily than those which have been allowed to run\r\n    with the dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW WORDS AS TO GENERAL MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nI think it cruel to keep cows tied up all summer. They do not require\r\nmuch exercise, but fresh air they must have, and it is a great comfort\r\nto them to lick themselves, although they ought to be well curried every\r\nday. It is better to milk after feeding, as they stand more quietly.\r\nDon’t allow your milk-maid to wash the cow’s teats in the milk pail, a\r\nfilthy habit much in vogue. Insist on her taking a wet cloth and wiping\r\nthe cow’s bag thoroughly before she commences to milk. A cow ought to be\r\nmilked in ten minutes, although the first time I undertook to milk alone,\r\nI tugged away for an hour. I knew how much milk I ought to have, and I\r\nwas bound to get it. An old cow will eat more than a young one, but will\r\ngive richer milk. If you can get a cow with her second calf, you can keep\r\nher profitably for five years, when she should be sold to the butcher.\r\nThere is nothing that will keep your cow-shed so neat, and add so much\r\nto the value of your manure pile, as a few shovelfuls of dry earth or\r\nmuck thrown under the cow. It will absorb the liquid manure better than\r\nanything else. Don’t allow your milk pans to be appropriated for all\r\nsorts of household uses; you cannot make sweet, firm butter if the milk\r\nis put into rusty old tin. Skim the milk twice a day into the stone\r\nchurn; add a little salt, and stir it well every time you put in fresh\r\ncream. Use spring water, but don’t allow ice to come in contact with the\r\nbutter; it destroys both color and flavor. If your cream is too warm,\r\nthe butter will come more quickly, but it will be white and soft. When\r\nthe cream is so cold that it takes me half an hour to churn, I always\r\nhave the best butter. Don’t put your hands to it, work out the buttermilk\r\nwith a wooden paddle, and work in the salt with the same thing. There\r\nis an old saying that one quart of milk a day gives one pound of butter\r\na week, and I think it’s a pretty fair rule, but don’t expect to buy a\r\ncow that will give you thirty quarts of milk a day. There are such cows\r\nI know, but they are not for sale. Be quite satisfied if your cow gives\r\nhalf that quantity. Place the cow’s food where she cannot step on it,\r\nbut don’t put it high up; It is natural for them to eat with their heads\r\ndown. I think it is better that the family cow should have a calf every\r\nyear, provided you can have them come early in the spring or late in the\r\nautumn. As to the time that a cow should be dry, that depends much upon\r\nthe way the cow was brought up. If she was allowed to go dry early in the\r\nseason with her first calf, she will always do it. A cow being a very\r\nconservative animal, she should be milked as long as her milk is good.\r\nWhen she is dry, stop feeding the provender, bran, and oil-cake, and give\r\nher plenty of good hay, with some roots, until after she calves. The\r\nprovender and oil-cake being strong food, are apt to produce inflammation\r\nand other troubles at calving time. You can feed turnips when she is dry,\r\nat the rate of two pails a day, cut up fine, of course, but don’t feed\r\nturnips when she is milking. I have tried every way to destroy the flavor\r\nof turnips in milk, but without success. I have boiled it, put soda in\r\nit, fed the cow after milking, but it was all the same—turnip flavor\r\nunmistakable—and as we don’t like our butter so flavored, I only feed\r\nturnips when the cow is dry.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E. P. Roe in his delightful book called “Play and Profit in\r\nMy Garden,” says: “If a family in ordinary good circumstances, kept a\r\nseparate account of the fruit and vegetables bought and used during the\r\nyear, they would, doubtless, be surprised at the sum total. But if they\r\ncould see the amount they could and would consume if they didn’t have\r\nto buy, surprise would be a very mild way of putting it.” The same rule\r\napplies to the keeping of a cow. We buy one quart a day and manage to\r\nget along with it. Our cow gives us ten to twenty quarts a day and we\r\nmake way with the greater part of it. I think with a cow and a garden,\r\none may manage to live, but life without either, according to my ways of\r\nthinking, would be shorn of many of its pleasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COW IN THE MIDDLE STATES.\r\n\r\nBY W. L. BATTLES, GIRARD, PA.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of writing on how a cow might be kept, I propose simply to tell\r\njust how we manage our cow, what we feed her, how we procure that food;\r\nin fact everything relating to her care, so that any one can go and do\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\n“Spot,” we call her, for she has a beautiful white spot in her forehead,\r\nis not a Jersey, for we can not afford to buy one at the prices at which\r\nthey are held with us; nor is she a thorough-bred of any kind; yet she\r\nis a good cow, of medium size, fills a twelve-quart pail each night and\r\nmorning, when her milk is in good flow, that raises a thick coat of rich\r\ncream, which, after been churned, furnishes all the butter needed for a\r\nfamily of six, and some to spare. Our place is small, only two acres,\r\nand a portion of this is covered by the dwelling, barn, poultry-house,\r\netc. The fruit garden occupies about one-fourth of an acre, and from\r\nthis portion nothing is grown to furnish food for “Spot.” Adjoining the\r\nbarn there is half an acre of the land in good grass, or mostly clover,\r\nand every spring a quart of clover seed is sown, so as fast as the old\r\nplants die out, young ones take their places. A bushel of land plaster\r\nis sown on this when the grass begins to start in the spring. This plot\r\nproduces a very heavy growth of grass and clover, enabling us to cut it\r\nthree times each season; about the first of June, August, and of October.\r\nA coat of fine manure is always spread over the ground immediately after\r\neach mowing. The grass is mostly cured, and makes fine hay for winter\r\nfeeding. Occasionally a small portion of the crop is used green for\r\nsoiling. Besides the land occupied by buildings, fruit garden, and clover\r\nplot, there remains about one acre, which we call the garden. Here are\r\ngrown all the vegetables for the family’s use, besides some to sell.\r\nAbout one-fourth of it is planted to Early Rose potatoes, and as soon as\r\nthese are sufficiently ripe for use or market, they are dug, and sweet\r\ncorn, in drills, for fodder, is sown upon the land. Another fourth of an\r\nacre is planted to sugar beets; the ground being very rich, the yield is\r\nalways large; this last season (1879), though very dry, I harvested one\r\nhundred and seventy-eight bushels. Our cow is very fond of the beets,\r\nand I think there is nothing better to keep up a flow of milk, and they\r\ngive it no bad flavor, as do turnips. An additional fourth of an acre is\r\nplanted to sweet, or evergreen, corn; as fast as the corn is picked for\r\nuse or market, the green stalks are cut up, run through the cutting-box,\r\nand every particle of them consumed. As soon as the corn is all\r\nharvested, the ground it occupied is thoroughly fitted and manured, and\r\nthen sown to winter rye, to be used for soiling the next spring, after\r\nwhich the ground is again prepared for corn. The remaining fourth acre is\r\ndevoted to early peas, beans, cabbages and other garden vegetables. As\r\nsoon as one crop is off, the ground is prepared, and something else is\r\nalmost always planted or sown; consequently, on the most of this acre,\r\ntwo crops are produced each season, except where sugar-beets are grown,\r\nor late cabbages, which require the whole season to mature. With the\r\nclover on the half acre, and the forage crop and roots on the acre, we\r\nhave not only had sufficient food for the cow the entire season, but have\r\nalso kept our family horse, with the exception of one load of oat-straw\r\npurchased for three dollars, to mix in with the fodder corn; this is hard\r\nto cure sufficiently to keep bright and sweet through the winter, but by\r\nmixing a layer of corn-fodder, and a layer of straw, it all comes out\r\nnice and bright. Besides keeping both horse and cow, we have marketed\r\nfrom this little farm, in berries, vegetables, butter, eggs, poultry, and\r\none fat hog, weighing, dressed, over three hundred pounds, four hundred\r\nand sixty-eight dollars’ worth of the above produce, keeping enough for\r\nour own use, and salting down one barrel of pork.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARN.\r\n\r\nThe barn is twenty-five by thirty feet, with the stable on the south\r\nside. The stall for “Spot” is five feet wide, and the floor on which\r\nshe stands is five feet long, with a manger two feet wide in front, one\r\nand a half high next to the cow, and three feet next to the barn floor.\r\nShe is fastened with a wide strap around her neck, attached to a chain\r\neighteen inches long, which is fastened to a staple driven into a post\r\nat the corner of the stall adjoining the manger; this gives her room to\r\nturn her head so as to lick any portion of her body. The floor is made of\r\ntwo-inch plank, battened on the under side with thin boards, raised from\r\nthe ground ten inches in rear and one foot in front; all the droppings\r\nand urine fall into the four-foot alley behind. This alley has a clay\r\nfloor beaten perfectly solid and level. Next to the stable door is a\r\nlarge bin, ten by seven feet, for storing road-dust or muck; at the other\r\nend of the stable is another bin, ten by eleven feet, for storing leaves\r\nfor bedding. My great object is not only to make “Spot” comfortable,\r\nand have her stable free from all bad odors, but to save all the manure,\r\nboth liquid and solid. The best absorbent is dried muck, pulverized,\r\nor road-dust from clayey roads. As it is easier to procure the latter,\r\nI generally make use of that, and always keep from two to three inches\r\nof it in the alley; this effectually absorbs all the liquid portions\r\nand all offensive odors. Twice each day, this is thrown out through a\r\nwindow closed by a sliding shutter in the rear of the stall, under a\r\nshed, where it remains until wanted for use. In the fall, I go to the\r\nwoods and procure a sufficient quantity of leaves to last until spring; a\r\nliberal use of these not only makes a nice, soft, clean bed, but largely\r\nincreases the quantity of manure. The stable opens into a small yard,\r\nacross one corner of which runs a small brook. Each morning, the cow is\r\npermitted to go out and drink; if the weather is pleasant, she is allowed\r\nto remain out an hour for exercise. She is let out the same at night,\r\nafter sunset in warm weather, so that she will not be annoyed by flies.\r\nThe barn is well-battened, and is warm in winter; it is well ventilated\r\nby two windows, but these, in summer, are darkened by blinds, with wide\r\nslats, to keep out flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF FEEDING.\r\n\r\nEach morning, while “Spot” is eating her breakfast, she is well curried\r\nwith a curry comb or card, and if any filth is observed on her bag or\r\nteats (which is very seldom), they are carefully washed off, if in\r\nwinter, with warm water. She is never scolded nor whipped; consequently\r\nshe never kicks over the pail, or holds up her milk. She is fed in winter\r\nwith a peck of sugar-beets cut up, both morning, noon, and night; also, a\r\nbushel of cut feed, either corn-stalks or clover hay, wet with a pailful\r\nof hot water, with two quarts of “sugar meal,” or bran, thoroughly mixed\r\ntogether, with a little salt sprinkled over it. I generally use what is\r\nknown here as “sugar meal” to mix with her feed; it is corn meal from the\r\nfactory after the sugar or glucose has been extracted; it costs from ten\r\ncents to twelve and a half cents per bushel, and I prefer it to bran,\r\nand “Spot” likes it very much. We consider her a machine for converting\r\nthe food we give her into milk, and the more we can get her to eat and\r\ndigest, the more milk is obtained, and the greater the profit. It is\r\na good plan to change the food occasionally, substituting carrots for\r\nbeets, clover hay for corn fodder, for brutes, like mankind, are fond of\r\na variety. There are root-cutters that can be procured for cutting up\r\nroots, but I have always used a common spade, ground sharp, and an empty\r\nflour barrel to hold the beets. It takes but a few minutes to cut up a\r\nmess of beets in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE.\r\n\r\nWith a bin of road-dust, and one of leaves, a winter’s supply of litter\r\nis secured, and it is surprising what a pile of manure we have in the\r\nspring. Another valuable source of manure is the pigsty, with plenty\r\nof leaves for a warm bed, and sufficient road-dust to absorb all the\r\nliquids, it is astonishing how clean our pigs are, and the sty is free\r\nfrom all bad odors; the big potatoes and mammoth beets, show the richness\r\nof the pig-pen fertilizer. I think our fifty hens pay for all their food\r\nwith the droppings the poultry-house furnishes. The roosts are over a\r\nslanting platform, which is kept covered with road-dust both summer and\r\nwinter; the droppings fall on this floor, and roll down into a large box\r\ntwelve feet long, three feet wide, and three feet deep. The dust the\r\nchickens work down with the droppings is sufficient to absorb all the\r\nammonia and preserve all the fertilizing qualities of this most valuable\r\nguano. A large box of road-dust is always kept in the water-closet, a\r\nliberal use of which furnishes a quantity of most valuable fertilizer,\r\nbesides freeing the closets from all noxious smells. The wash water and\r\nslops from the kitchen are utilized by being thrown on a pile of sods and\r\nother rubbish, which are forked over, and as soon as decayed, carted to\r\nthe manure pile. From so many sources we are enabled to give our small\r\nfarm a most liberal supply of manure each spring and fall, so that even\r\nwith the double cropping most of it gets, it continues to improve, and\r\nyields more bountifully each succeeding season.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPS AND TILLAGE.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of sugar beets, the ground is first manured heavily,\r\nplowed deep, and thoroughly pulverized with the cultivator, then\r\nmarked out in rows with a garden plow, two feet apart. Manure from the\r\npoultry-house is scattered in each furrow, which should be lightly\r\ncovered with soil, so the seed will not come in contact with it; drop the\r\nseeds about six inches apart, covering lightly with the garden rake. When\r\nthe leaves are about four inches long, thin out to one plant in a place,\r\nand fill any vacancies with the plants pulled out. Hoe them thoroughly,\r\ndestroying all weeds, which can easily be done by cultivating each\r\ntime before hoeing, with an arrow cultivator. Keep the ground mellow,\r\nand cultivate three or four times, after which they will take care of\r\nthemselves and soon cover the ground. With ground in good condition,\r\nand a fair season, six hundred to eight hundred bushels per acre can be\r\neasily produced. Let them grow until frost comes, when they should be dug\r\nwith a garden fork, the tops cut off, and stored for winter. Those to be\r\nused before the first of March, are stored in the cellar, the others are\r\nburied in a long pit, digging out a shallow place, piling up the roots\r\nabout three feet high, and three feet wide, covering well with straw\r\nand sufficient soil to keep them from freezing, putting in a drain-tile\r\nabout every four feet in the top of the pile, with one end to project a\r\nlittle through the covering, for ventilation. If the weather becomes very\r\ncold, lay a turf over the tile, and remove when pleasant. I grow carrots\r\nafter the same plan, and store in like manner. I prefer beets, as they\r\nare so much larger, it is less trouble to gather and take care of them,\r\nand the crop is generally larger, still I always grow some carrots for a\r\nchange. I plant sweet corn in drills, always put some fertilizer along\r\nthe furrow, dropping the kernels about eight inches apart, with the rows\r\nthree feet wide, I commence planting soon after May first, and continue\r\nat intervals until about July first, so I can have a fresh supply for\r\nuse, and market, all the season. The sweet corn being grown on the plot\r\nsown to winter rye, for soiling, enables us to cut some portions of it\r\ntwice, before the ground is needed for corn. When sowing corn for fodder,\r\nwhich is done as soon as we commence digging the early potatoes, I sow\r\nit in drills two feet apart, and drop the kernels about one inch apart\r\nin the drills, manure from the pigsty is first dropped in the furrow,\r\nand covered with soil at least two inches deep, or the corn will not\r\ncome up. This fertilizer is so strong, if properly used it causes a most\r\nextraordinary growth of stalks. While the corn is small, cultivate it\r\ntwo or three times with a narrow cultivator, when it will take care of\r\nitself, and there will be a surprising growth of stalks; I have them\r\noften six feet high. Just before time for frosts, cut with a scythe, and\r\nset up in small bunches bound around the top, and leave to cure until\r\ncold weather. When it is to be put in the mow, spread alternately a\r\nlayer of stalks, and a layer of straw, and it will keep bright and sweet\r\nuntil wanted. The rye for spring soiling is sown when the sweet corn is\r\npicked, and stalks removed, in drills about ten inches apart. Fine manure\r\nis spread on the ground after plowing, and thoroughly mixed with the\r\nsurface soil; one or two hoeings being given to keep the ground mellow;\r\nto destroy any weeds that may make their appearance. By May first, the\r\nearly sown rye will cover the ground with a dense growth, at least four\r\nfeet high, furnishing a large quantity of most nutritious green food. On\r\nthose portions of the plot where the latest corn is to be planted, two or\r\nthree cuttings are made; this gives most excellent food for the cow, and\r\nthe quantity grown on this fourth of an acre will surprise any one who\r\nhas never tried it. There is quite a plot of early peas, and as soon as\r\nthe last picking occurs, while the vines are green, they are pulled and\r\nfed to “Spot,” who relishes them very much. Turnips, or corn, are at once\r\nsown on the ground where the peas were.\r\n\r\nWhen our early cabbages are taken up, all the leaves, and much of the\r\nstalks, are turned into milk by taking them to the cow’s manger, and\r\nthe ground at once planted, or sown, to something that will make more\r\nfood. The beet, carrot, and turnip tops, and late cabbage leaves, make\r\nquite a quantity of feed late in the fall, if care is taken in saving\r\nand preserving them. Possibly there may be some better forage crop than\r\n“evergreen,” or sugar corn; I think another fall I will try the Minnesota\r\nAmber Sugar Cane, in a small way. I tried Pearl Millet, in one row, this\r\nseason; it tillered, or spread wonderfully, but did not do so well as\r\nthe corn, as the stalks were small, and the millet makes such a feeble\r\ngrowth, at first, it requires the whole season to produce as much fodder\r\nas I get from corn sowed the fourth of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVING.\r\n\r\nI generally manage to have the cow come in about the first of September;\r\nby that means the six weeks time she is allowed to go dry, occurs during\r\nthe warmest portion of the summer, viz., in July and August, when,\r\nwith the facilities the person who keeps but one cow possesses, it is\r\ndifficult to make good butter. This is also the season when butter most\r\ngenerally sells the lowest.\r\n\r\nThe calf is taught to drink after it is a week or ten days old, and fed\r\non a porridge made from skim-milk and wheat middlings, or shorts; by\r\nthe time it is six weeks or two months old it will be well fattened,\r\nand can be sold to the butcher for veal, at a good price, for at that\r\nseason of the year veal is scarce and in demand. The cow being in full\r\nflow of milk all winter, when butter is most always high, will pay a good\r\nprofit for her feed and care. A couple of weeks prior to the time the\r\ncalf should be born, I make a box stall on the barn floor, and permit the\r\ncow to run loose in it until the calf is taken away to learn to drink.\r\nDuring this time she should have a good bed of leaves, and the stall be\r\ncleaned each night and morning. So far at such times I have experienced\r\nno difficulty, or trouble; should any occur, it is better to apply to\r\nan experienced person, than to try and “doctor” her yourself. After the\r\ncalf is born, I feed the cow on warm slops a day or two, permitting the\r\ncalf to suck until the swelling has gone from her bag, and it has assumed\r\nits natural condition. Then, as before stated, teach it to drink, which\r\ncan easily be done by inserting the finger in its mouth, and putting its\r\nhead in the dish, cautiously withdrawing the finger a few times, and in a\r\nshort time you will have no difficulty, as it will help itself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can say I have tried to state just how our cow is\r\nmanaged and kept. I presume there can be improvements made on our system.\r\nI shall be glad to take advantage of the experience of others, at any and\r\nall times. No record is kept of the milk obtained, or of the butter made.\r\nWe know we always have plenty for the family’s use, and considerable to\r\nspare. Bread and milk furnish the children half their food a portion of\r\nthe time. Pure milk and plenty of fresh fruits, in abundance, we consider\r\nafford one of the principal reasons why our family is so healthy, and we\r\nhave so few doctor’s bills to pay.\r\n\r\nFrom our acre and a half, all the food has been grown for both cow and\r\nhorse, except the three dollars expended for straw. The “sugar meal”\r\ngiven the cow has not cost five dollars during the past year. It is safe\r\nto say, that one half, and probably more, of the clover, corn fodder,\r\ngreen rye, etc., has been fed to the horse. Consequently the keeping of\r\nthe cow can all be credited to the small area of about three-fourths of\r\nan acre of land, in addition to an outlay of not exceeding seven dollars\r\nfor meal, bran, and straw. This land, about one half of it, has also\r\nproduced, in addition, full crops for the use of the family, or market,\r\nwhile the sour milk and buttermilk have largely assisted in making six\r\nhundred pounds of pork. The calf, at less than two months of age, was\r\nsold for eight dollars, which more than paid for the extra feed bought\r\nfor the cow. The family which has never kept a cow can hardly realize\r\nthe satisfaction and benefits derived from such a source. Children,\r\nwhose appetites are often capricious, will almost always relish a cup of\r\ncool milk. Cream, for our coffee at breakfast, is much enjoyed by all,\r\nbut realized by few, and what can be more delicious than a nice dish of\r\nstrawberries smothered in rich yellow cream. When we consider the small\r\nexpense, the little trouble and care, contrasted with the great benefits\r\nderived, it is, so to speak, surprising that any family should rest\r\nsatisfied without possessing a cow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—THE AYRSHIRE COW “OLD CREAMER.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COW IN THE GULF STATES.\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE G. DUFFEE, MOBILE, ALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years I had been experimenting on a small scale in soiling\r\ncattle. My area of land, however, was exceedingly limited, being only\r\na portion of the kitchen garden of a city residence, but my success\r\nwas, even in this small way, so satisfactory, that I determined at\r\nsome future day to try it on a more extensive scale. My reading and\r\nexperience convinced me, that in our favored southern climate, a half\r\nacre of land, intelligently cultivated, would produce a supply of food\r\namply sufficient to support one cow through the year, and circumstances\r\nfavoring, I determined to try the experiment. In April, 1876, I became\r\nowner of a lot two hundred and fifty feet long by one hundred and twenty\r\nwide in the rear of my premises—the greater portion having been used as\r\na grass plot for a horse. I immediately began by fencing off a portion\r\none hundred and twenty feet by two hundred, running a wagon-way eight\r\nfeet wide down the center, which, with the space occupied by the stable\r\n(say twenty by thirty feet), left nearly twenty-two thousand feet, or\r\nwithin a fraction of half an acre, for actual cultivation. The land was\r\na sandy loam, covered with a thick sod of Bermuda and other grasses.\r\nYears before it had been cultivated as a market garden, but latterly\r\ngiven up to grass; it sloped to the south sufficiently to favor good\r\ndrainage. In and around the stable was a goodly lot of manure, which,\r\nduring April, was spread upon the land—some forty cart loads. On April\r\ntwentieth the land was thoroughly plowed with a two-horse turning-plow,\r\nand harrowed until finely pulverized. On May first, I planted one half\r\nof the land in Southern field corn, in drills two feet apart, with the\r\ngrains about one inch apart. The rows were lengthwise, to render after\r\ncultivation more convenient. On May fourth, sugar corn was put in one\r\nhalf of the remainder, planting at the same distance as the larger\r\nvariety. May sixth, the remaining fourth was sown heavily with German\r\nor “Golden” Millet, in drills twelve inches apart. Seasonable showers,\r\nfollowed by warm sunny days, soon produced a vigorous and rapid growth.\r\nOn May fifteenth, a Thomas’ harrow was run over the first planted corn,\r\nand six days later over the second planting, and over the millet. On May\r\nthirtieth, the corn was plowed, followed by a good hoeing. A fortnight\r\nlater, a second and last hoeing was given. The millet was also hoed\r\ntwice, after which the growth effectually shaded the ground, and thus\r\nprevented the growth of weeds. In the meantime I had repaired the stable,\r\nand had a large door cut into the side next to the original lot, and\r\nmade a stall for our pet Jersey cow. The floor was cypress, three inches\r\nthick, and sloped slightly from the manger. By actual measurement of the\r\nspace occupied by the cow—giving just room for her hind feet to clear the\r\nsame, a trough, eight inches deep, and fifteen wide, was made to receive\r\nthe urine and droppings. The stall was four and one half feet wide, the\r\nsides coming only half the length of the cow, and just her hight. The\r\nmanger extended entirely across the stall, was twelve inches wide at the\r\nbottom, and eighteen at the top, and twelve deep, the bottom being twelve\r\ninches above the floor. The fastening consisted of a five-eighths iron\r\nrod, passing from one side of the stall to the other, along the center\r\nof the manger, and one inch from it. On this rod was a ring, to which\r\nwas attached a short chain that ended in a snap-catch, to attach to a\r\nring fastened to the head-stall—the head-stall being made of good, broad\r\nleather. Usually, in turning the cow out in the morning, the head-stall\r\nwas unbuckled and left in the stable; to fasten again was but a moment’s\r\nwork. By this arrangement the cow had full liberty to move her head,\r\nwithout any possibility of getting fastened by the halter. The bottom of\r\nthis manger was made of slats, one half inch apart, so that no dirt could\r\ncollect. For feeding wet messes, there was a box made to fit one end of\r\nthe manger, which could be removed to be washed without trouble. With\r\nplenty of sawdust, costing only the hauling, perfect comfort and perfect\r\ncleanliness were matters of course.\r\n\r\nAttached to the stable was a lot fifty by fifty feet, where, in pleasant\r\nweather, the cow was turned, but free to go in and out of her stall at\r\npleasure. In this lot was a trough, connected with the pump, where a\r\nsupply of clean and fresh water was always kept. Daily this trough was\r\nemptied and thoroughly cleaned. A cow may eat dirty feed occasionally,\r\nbut see to it that the water she drinks is pure. Unless this is attended\r\nto her milk is unfit for human food.\r\n\r\nThe manure trough being supplied with sawdust, the urine, as well as the\r\ndroppings, were saved and removed daily to a covered shed located in one\r\ncorner of the lot, where it was kept moist, and worked over occasionally.\r\nOur Jersey was due with her second calf about June twentieth, but was\r\nstill giving milk in April and May. Her feed from May first to June\r\nfifteenth, was the run of a common pasture, with a mess twice daily of\r\nwheat bran and corn meal, with hay. On June first she was dried up for a\r\nbrief resting spell. June fifteenth we began cutting the sugar corn, now\r\nwaist high. This was run through a cutter (making cuts three-quarters\r\nof an inch), and fed to her three times a day, first sprinkling two\r\nquarts of wheat bran over the corn, and continuing the hay feed twice\r\na day. At the same time she was taken from the pasture, not to go on\r\nagain until this experiment was finished. June twenty-second her udder\r\nwas so distended, it was deemed prudent to relieve it by milking. This\r\nwas done twice a day for three days. Here, at the South, there is a\r\nfoolish prejudice against doing this, the belief being strong among\r\nthe ignorant classes that it will cause the death of the coming calf.\r\nIn some instances I have found it necessary to relieve the udder daily\r\nfor a week before calving; I never knew any evil to result. At dawn\r\nJune twenty-fifth there was a fine heifer calf beside her. As soon as\r\nconvenient the cow was thoroughly milked, and a bucket of water, with one\r\nquart each of corn meal and wheat bran stirred in, and a pinch of salt,\r\nwas given her, and nothing else except water for twenty-four hours. At\r\nevening she was again milked to the last drop, and the calf left with\r\nher during the night. Next morning a small feed of three quarts of wheat\r\nbran, and one quart of corn meal, made pretty wet, was given her, and\r\nher udder again thoroughly emptied. After milking, a small feed of hay\r\nwas given, and a pail of water placed near. The calf was separated from\r\nher, but within sight. At mid-day the calf was allowed to take her fill,\r\nand afterwards the udder stripped. At evening, as the cow seemed to be\r\nfree from any indications of fever, or inflamed bag, she was given a\r\nfull mess of corn meal, wheat bran, cotton-seed meal, and hay. Her calf\r\ntook her supper, and the udder was again stripped; that night the calf\r\nwas taken from her, never to suck again, as fresh milk in a city was too\r\nvaluable to feed to even a registered Jersey. Having, in years past, lost\r\nseveral very fine cows from over-feeding and under-milking, at calving\r\ntime, I cannot urge too strongly what Col. Geo. E. Waring calls “high\r\nstarvation” at this critical period in a cow’s life. If a cow has been\r\ndecently cared for up to the day of calving, she needs nothing but rest,\r\nquiet, and a light mash,—warm in cold weather—for twenty-four hours, and\r\nthen but light feeding for two or three days. But be sure to empty her\r\nudder completely at least twice every twenty-four hours, and if the cow\r\nis a deep milker, then three times; with this treatment, the feed can be\r\ngradually increased to all that she will eat up clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEACHING THE CALF TO DRINK.\r\n\r\nIt is a very easy matter to teach a calf to drink milk, when one has seen\r\nthe thing done. Next morning this calf was impatient for her mess of warm\r\nmilk, so, after milking her dam, I took a shallow pan, and putting two\r\nquarts of milk into it proceeded to give the first lesson in a calf’s\r\nlife, of doing without a mother. The process is very simple; you merely\r\nwet the first and second fingers of the left hand with milk, and place\r\nthem in the calf’s mouth, to give her a taste of what is in store. Repeat\r\nthis a few times, then gradually draw the pan near her mouth with the\r\nright hand, using your left as above. When the calf permits your two\r\nfingers to enter her mouth, raise the pan so that your left hand will\r\nbe immersed, and the calf, by suction, will draw the milk up between\r\nthe fingers. At mid-day, another mess of milk, and a second lesson was\r\ngiven; at evening a third. Next morning the process was repeated, but\r\nin this instance she did not need the fingers to guide her to what was\r\ngood for her; she readily accepted the situation, and stuck her pretty\r\nnose into the warm milk, which rapidly disappeared to where it would do\r\nthe most good. But with milk worth ten cents per quart, and cream seven\r\ntimes as much, it did not “pay” to use six quarts daily of rich Jersey\r\nmilk in this way, so, after a fortnight’s supply of the raw material, the\r\nfeed was gradually changed to sweet skim-milk for two weeks, and then\r\nsubstituting hay-tea, the milk ration was cut down to two quarts daily.\r\nBeginning with a tablespoonful of cotton-seed meal, thoroughly mixed with\r\nthe feed, the quantity was increased in ten days to one pint daily. At\r\none month old, she was gradually taught to eat bran by stirring it into\r\nher food.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of hay-tea is very simple. Nice hay is run through a\r\ncutter, and taking an ordinary two-gallon pailful, boiling water is\r\npoured upon it; it is then covered and allowed to steep for twelve hours.\r\nThis makes a most excellent food, and calves thrive upon it. The most\r\nstylish and vigorous calf I ever saw, was raised upon hay-tea, with bran\r\nand cotton-seed meal as here described. I enter thus fully into the best\r\nmanner of raising a calf without its mother, for the especial benefit of\r\nmy southern readers, where the thriftless habit of allowing the calf to\r\nsuck its dam, oftentimes until a year old, so generally prevails. In this\r\ninstance the little heifer got along nicely until two months old, when an\r\naggravated attack of scours set in, but by timely doses of laudanum in a\r\nmess of warm gruel, poured down her throat twice a day, for three days,\r\na cure was effected. In ordinary cases of scours, a change to dry food\r\nwill correct it, but it is well to watch and not to permit the disease\r\nto become seated. A few years ago, a very valuable young Jersey heifer,\r\nreceived from the vicinity of Philadelphia, was taken in this way, while\r\nundergoing the usual course of acclimation incident to northern cattle\r\nbrought south, and the simpler treatment proving of no effect, I gave\r\ninjections twice a day of rice-water and laudanum, besides drenching her\r\nwith corn-gruel and laudanum. This was kept up for ten days; we carried\r\nher safely through, and her present value amply compensates for the time\r\nand trouble expended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD OF THE COW.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the cow. On the morning of June twenty-ninth, we\r\nbegan giving her a fair feed of green corn, adding to it wheat bran, and\r\ncotton-seed meal. July second we fed her all the corn stalks she would\r\neat, continuing to add bran and cotton meal, giving four quarts of the\r\nformer and two of the latter; and this was her daily food, including\r\nthe German Millet, treated in the same way, until September. The green\r\nfood was given three times a day, but the bran and cotton meal added\r\nonly morning and night. Occasionally a day’s supply was cut early in the\r\nmorning, and allowed to wilt before feeding, but in this, as well as in\r\nmany other matters, my man-of-all-work did as circumstances permitted.\r\nHis various duties about the place gave him but little time to reduce to\r\nan exact system the care and feed of a cow. She had a good stable, and\r\nplenty to eat, received daily a good brushing, and was treated kindly.\r\nYet, she was our servant (and a most faithful one she was), and we were\r\nnot her’s, or slaves to any arbitrary clock-work regularity. She was\r\nfed and milked at regular intervals, but beyond this it was not always\r\nconvenient to have regular hours at her stable. We did not keep her as\r\nan exhibition of a model cow in a model stable, and to exemplify a model\r\nsystem of care and keep. Like thousands all over the land, we kept her\r\nsimply for the profit she yielded, in the way of milk and butter. It has\r\noften struck me, in reading the many suggestions and hints about how to\r\nkeep a cow, to be found in some agricultural and live-stock journals,\r\nthat were they all carried into practical operation, it would take the\r\nentire time of two able-bodied men to attend one animal—one to be always\r\non hand during the day, the other to serve at night. Now common sense\r\nis a good thing, even when applied to the management of cows, and my\r\nexperience convinces me that the average man wishes only to know the\r\ncheapest and easiest way to have an abundant supply of rich, wholesome,\r\nand clean milk, and with pride enough in the possession of a good cow to\r\nfurnish a good shelter and comfortable quarters. Beyond these, breeders\r\nof fancy and high-priced stock may go to any extreme, and find a paying\r\nbusiness in doing so, but the village or city owner of one or two cows,\r\nkept solely for his own use, can not afford to indulge in any of this\r\n“upper-tendom” style of cow life; it won’t pay him. As a row of corn was\r\ncut and fed, the land was plowed, manured, and more corn (common field)\r\ndrilled in thick, so that the ground for the whole summer presented the\r\nappearance of an experimental corn field, with corn at every stage of its\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThis was kept up through the months of July, August, September, and\r\nOctober. Indeed, the half of this yield was more than sufficient for\r\nkeeping the cow in superb condition, so that much the greater portion was\r\ncut in the tasselling stage and cured for winter feed. After September\r\nbegins, it will not do to sow corn; the worms destroy it, but in our\r\nsouthern Bean, or “cow pea,” we have one of the very best of soiling\r\ncrops. Sown either broadcast, or in drills, it does equally well, makes a\r\nrapid growth, and affords a tempting and nutritious food for cattle. It\r\ngrows until checked by frost, and I know of no plant, save Indian corn,\r\nthat produces more weight to a given quantity of land. In this instance\r\nwe fed it daily during October and late into November, before a frost put\r\nan end to its use in its green state. Anticipating a frost, it was cut\r\nand cured for winter feed. Properly cured, no hay equals it for cattle.\r\n\r\nNovember twenty-fourth our cow went into winter quarters, and for her\r\nwinter feed there were over four thousand eight hundred pounds of well\r\ncured corn-fodder, and one thousand five hundred pounds of good pea-vine\r\nhay—far more than she could consume.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, after spreading over the land all the manure on hand,\r\nit was plowed again with a two-horse turning plow, and sowed thickly to\r\noats, harrowing them in. A seasonable rain gave them a good start, so\r\nthey were well prepared for the vicissitudes of winter—a good stand and\r\nvigorous growth. The cow now received a daily ration of corn fodder and\r\npea hay, run through the cutter, and after mixing thoroughly three quarts\r\nof wheat bran and one quart of cotton-seed meal, were wet with water\r\n(warm in cold weather). This was given her in the morning, and the same\r\nquantity at evening. The corn fodder and pea-hay for a day’s feed were\r\nfifteen pounds of each, more or less. On this food she was kept through\r\nthe winter, giving milk of excellent quality, and in good quantity.\r\n\r\nIn February, she was tethered every fair day in the oats, and in March,\r\nwe fed her a good mess of fresh cut oats, still, however, keeping up the\r\nwinter feed of corn fodder, pea-hay, wheat bran, and cotton meal. About\r\nApril first, the feed of green oats was increased to all she would eat,\r\nfeeding three times daily, and the excellence of this diet was shown by a\r\nmarked increase in the quantity of her milk. Though due to calve again in\r\nJuly, she continued to supply a family of ten persons with an abundance\r\nof milk. Late in April, when the oats were in the milk state, they were\r\ncut and cured for hay, making a little over a ton of good food.\r\n\r\nUpon summing up the result, the following dollar and cents view of the\r\nexperiment of sustaining a cow on a half acre is submitted. The labor\r\nexpended in cultivation is not put down as an item of expense, as the\r\ncarriage horse was used in plowing, and the hired man did the rest.\r\n\r\n                                 _Dr._\r\n\r\n    To 1,500 pounds Wheat Bran, at 90c.                     $13.50\r\n    ”    200 pounds Corn Meal, at 70c.                        1.40\r\n    ”    800 pounds Cotton-seed Meal, at $1                   8.00\r\n    ”    300 pounds Hay, at 75c.                              2.25\r\n                                                            ------\r\n       Total                                                $25.15\r\n\r\n                                  _Cr._\r\n\r\n    By sale of 2,200 pounds of Corn-fodder, at 60c. $13.20\r\n         ”     2,100 pounds of Oats, at 75c.         15.75\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                                            $28.95\r\n      Profit                                                $ 3.80\r\n\r\nBut the profit above shown does not express the real profit. A year’s\r\ncontinuous supply of rich milk in abundance, for a large household, cream\r\nfor special occasions, and that best of luxuries, delicious home-made\r\nbutter, and one hundred dollars for the little heifer when six months\r\nold, aggregate the chief results of the experiment.\r\n\r\nFor the best results in soiling, no crop compares, as far as my\r\nexperience goes, with our Southern variety of Indian corn; on rich land\r\nit produces marvellously. I have raised it at the rate of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds (or fifty tons) per acre. There is no difficulty in\r\nproducing three crops in one season on the same land. But cattle need\r\na variety of food in soiling, as in other forms of feeding. Oats are\r\nexcellent, and come in early. Cat-tail Millet (“Pearl Millet”) is a rapid\r\ngrower, but cattle are not specially fond of it; they like German Millet\r\nbetter. Garden (or English) Peas make an excellent food, coming into use\r\nin March, and lasting to June. I remember one year I produced five crops\r\nfor soiling, on the same land, in one year, namely: oats, three of corn,\r\nand one of cow-peas. The last named is a superb food late in the year,\r\nafter corn has gone. I have never experimented with roots, nor am I aware\r\nof any being cultivated in the South as a soiling crop. Cabbages set out\r\nin September and October will be ready for feeding in December, and will,\r\nnext to corn, produce the largest weight of green food. One year I fed\r\nthem to a considerable extent, and found my cows were very partial to\r\nthem. By beginning with cabbages in December, to be succeeded by oats in\r\nMarch, then peas, corn, and millet, to wind up in November with cow-pea,\r\na cow in our climate can be soiled every day in the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—THE JERSEY COW “ROSALEE.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE COW IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBEING THE JOURNAL OF THE KEEPER.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY E. ALVORD, EASTHAMPTON, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing upon this subject the narrative form is convenient, and while\r\nit cannot be claimed that this is entirely a “true story,” it may be said\r\nto be founded on fact. Personal experience is my basis, and whatever of\r\nfancy may be interwoven with the facts would have been quite practicable,\r\nand all ought to have occurred as narrated, if all did not.\r\n\r\nLet me premise by saying that I own a comfortable little home in a\r\nvillage of a few thousand inhabitants, not a thousand miles from New\r\nYork, supporting my family by a moderate income earned from day to day,\r\nand my occupation is such as to enable me to spend an average of three\r\nhours of daylight on my place, from the middle of March to the middle\r\nof October, and occasionally a whole day besides. Thus I can make and\r\ncare for my garden, which for some years has uniformly been an excellent\r\none, quite a model, though I say it. Of this sort of work I have always\r\nbeen very fond, as well as of domestic animals, all kinds of which were\r\nfamiliar to me when a boy.\r\n\r\nMAY 1ST, 1875.—For several years I have kept more or less poultry, and\r\nsometimes a pig; there is so much from a good garden that is otherwise\r\nwasted. The ambition of the family is to own a horse and a cow. It has\r\nbeen talked about a good deal, but we are agreed that the horse would be\r\na pure luxury, in our circumstances, and must wait. The cow I have felt\r\nwould be a luxury too, that is, cost more than it would produce, but on\r\nthis point the good wife has differed with me, claiming that it would be\r\na real economy. It has been a part of our domestic policy to use milk and\r\nbutter liberally, thereby keeping down the butcher’s bill and buying very\r\nlittle lard. Of the value of milk as an article of food, in its natural\r\nstate, and in the many ways which it can be used in cooking, there can\r\nbe no doubt, especially where there are young and growing members of\r\nthe family. Still, I have been skeptical on the economy of keeping a\r\ncow, and to convince me, the help-meet recently proved, from well kept\r\naccounts, that during the last two years there have been consumed by our\r\nfamily of five persons, one thousand five hundred and forty-five quarts\r\nof milk, averaging seven cents a quart, and three hundred and sixty-one\r\npounds of butter, average price thirty-three cents a pound. These have\r\namounted to a cash expenditure of one hundred and thirteen dollars and\r\nsixty-four cents a year, which was a decided surprise to me, and feeling\r\npretty sure the expense need not exceed two dollars a week, I yielded\r\nto the argument; am the owner of a cow, and here record the result of\r\nmy experiment. One of the pleasant spring days of last week, we took a\r\ndrive among the farms of the vicinity, and selected a good looking cow\r\nwhich had just dropped her second calf. The price paid was sixty-five\r\ndollars, to be delivered to me to-day, without the calf. The man I bought\r\nof called her “pure Alderney,” but she looks large of her age for that\r\nrace, weighing somewhat over seven hundred pounds, and if, two or three\r\ngenerations back there was a cross of Ayrshire, or of Guernsey, it is all\r\nthe better. My belief is that she has a streak of Ayrshire blood, and\r\nthat she will make a fine cow. Being three years old next month (exact\r\ndate unknown), it has been decided that our cow is to be known as “June.”\r\n\r\nMAY 1ST, 1876.—When “June” was bought, it was in the full expectation\r\nthat pasturage could be hired in a small lot adjoining the rear of mine.\r\nI supposed it was fixed, but the spring had been favorable, the grass\r\non the meadow promised well, and the owner concluded he would mow it,\r\nso that arrangement fell through. By that time I was too late to secure\r\nroom in the only pasture convenient to the village, and I have been\r\nforced to keep her in the stable and a small stable yard, the whole year.\r\nThe result is more than satisfactory, considering the disadvantageous\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nA year ago to-day “June” arrived, in fair condition, save that her coat\r\nlooked a little rough, and with a good bag of milk; her daily yield\r\nthat month was about twelve quarts. In a day or two I noticed that when\r\nin the yard, she rubbed her neck vigorously against the corner of the\r\nstable and sometimes backed up to a building or fence for the purpose. An\r\nexamination proved that she had vermin upon her; so I made a pail full of\r\nstrong suds, with soft soap, and put into it an ounce of sulphuric acid,\r\nand with this I sponged the parts infested, twice daily, for a few days.\r\nThis seemed efficient and there has been no such trouble since.\r\n\r\nFor long forage “June” had only dry food, good fine hay, until late\r\nin May, and then I began to give her a green bite whenever I could,\r\nclippings from the yard, trimmings of early vegetables and whatever there\r\nwas to spare from the garden. Besides this, everything she ate had to be\r\nbought, except a few roots used since February. A little bran was fed for\r\nthe first few days, and gradually increased, so that during the summer\r\nshe received four pounds daily, fed in two parts, morning and night.\r\nLater in the season corn-meal was added to the ration, and at times oats\r\nwere substituted for the bran. In the winter, eight pounds of meal and\r\nbran, half and half, mixed, was the daily allowance. Buying hay in small\r\nquantities I managed to keep both rowen and clover hay on hand, some of\r\nit very fresh, and could thus vary the dry food. Also, for variety, I\r\nfrequently gave one cut feed a day, moistened. Besides this, I obtained\r\nand worked in, during the summer, a lot of half-ripe oats, in the straw,\r\nwhich had lodged and were cured like hay. The food, although thus often\r\nchanged, was changed carefully.\r\n\r\nIn my garden I made a large parsnip bed, and followed my earliest peas\r\nwith carrots, so that in the fall there were several bushels of these\r\nroots. The carrots were buried in the garden, a mellow loam, and the\r\nparsnips left in the ground. The former were opened during a thaw in\r\nFebruary, and a few fed to “June” each day, lasting until the end of\r\nMarch; by that time I could get the parsnips and they have just given\r\nout. When I began the roots the grain was gradually withheld and she has\r\nhad none since February. These roots have had a most apparent effect,\r\ngiving her coat a bright, thrifty look, and she is in fine condition\r\nfor calving, which is expected in ten days. But the roots made it hard\r\nto dry off the cow. She was shrinking in milk fast when we began on\r\nthe carrots, then started up again and was giving about three quarts a\r\nday in March, when the milk (and especially the cream) began to have a\r\nsharp, unpleasant, bitter taste, and we soon had to give up using it.\r\nIt then took a fortnight to dry her off, which was done by lessening\r\nthe roots, milking not quite dry, then only once a day, and once in two\r\ndays. Water has been offered three times a day, through the year, all\r\nshe would drink, salt has always been within her reach. All summer, and\r\nevery mild, dry day in winter, “June” has passed some hours in the stable\r\nyard. A large amount of bedding has been necessary, and for this I have\r\nused the waste hay, the rakings of the yard last autumn, the scrapings\r\nof the garden walks, garden litter, and the leaves from a row of maple\r\ntrees in front of the house, carefully saved for the purpose. So much in\r\nthe stall, “June” has required more personal care, and it has been made a\r\nrule to rub and brush her body enough to keep it clean and free from dead\r\nskin. But I never use a harsh card; nothing is better for rubbing than a\r\npiece of old seine or very coarse bagging. Everything about the cow, too,\r\nis kept clean and sweet.\r\n\r\nThe result of this continuous stabling has been a rapid accumulation of\r\nmanure, and this having been mixed with all the suitable refuse of the\r\nplace, and forked over several times, I this spring have on hand a huge\r\npile of rich compost. It is more than can be used on the garden, and the\r\nnewer part has been corded up under a temporary shed for sale or future\r\nuse. This alone well pays for all my extra work in keeping the cow, as I\r\nhave yearly been obliged to buy for the garden.\r\n\r\nOur plan during the year has been to sell a little milk to neighbors, set\r\naside two quarts daily for family use, cream and all. The cream from the\r\nremainder has been made into butter, and an accurate account kept of the\r\nbutter produced.\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of this first year keeping one cow:\r\n\r\n                   EXPENSES:\r\n\r\n    Interest 7 per cent on cost of cow $ 4.55\r\n      4 tons of Hay, av. $20            80.00\r\n    500 lbs Oats in straw                4.25\r\n    960 lbs.

No labor is charged, for I am not so much keeping an exact\r\naccount of the maintenance of the cow, as of the profit of my keeping\r\none, taking care of her myself. And no credit is given for manure, as I\r\nmean to apply that to reducing the cost of keeping in the future. The\r\ncow might have been fed at less cost, but I intended to have her improve\r\non my hands, and she has done so. “June” now weighs seven hundred and\r\nsixty-two pounds, is about to have her third calf, and is certainly worth\r\nmore than was paid for her.\r\n\r\nAltogether, in spite of unfavorable conditions there is no occasion to\r\ncomplain of the result of the year.\r\n\r\nMAY 1ST, 1877.—Last spring, my neighbor, north, was willing to let me\r\nhave his acre and a half of meadow for pasturage, but wanted thirty-five\r\ndollars for the season. I would not pay that, and, instead, hired a\r\nplace for “June” in a large pasture half a mile or more distant, paying\r\ntwenty dollars for the season, May fifteenth, to October fifteenth, and\r\nfour dollars to a boy for driving. On the ninth of May, the cow dropped\r\na bull calf without difficulty, and I gave it away the next day. No\r\nspecial care was needed or given, except a little caution as to feeding,\r\nand on the fifteenth the cow went to pasture. She did remarkably well\r\nuntil early in July, being in pasture during the day, and at the stable\r\nat night. Then the weather grew very hot, the pasture dry, and “June”\r\nbegan to fail rapidly in her milk; so I commenced feeding a little bran,\r\nand offered hay when she came up at night. Later, a friend recommended\r\ncotton-seed meal, and a hundred weight of that was obtained and fed with\r\ngood results, two or three pounds a day. August was a month of intense\r\ndry heat, and the pasture became of little use except for the exercise,\r\nshade, and water. In spite of meal and hay fed at night, “June’s” yield\r\nof milk shrank to three quarts a day, and we feared she would go dry.\r\nAugust fifth, I made the change of sending her to pasture just before\r\nsix o’clock in the evening, as the boy went after the other cows, and\r\nbringing her up to the stable in the morning, where I kept her during the\r\nday. This was an improvement, and also gave better opportunity of feeding\r\nsweet corn stalks, vegetable trimmings and the like, fresh from the\r\ngarden. The grain was continued through August, and she ate more or less\r\nhay. At the end of the month she was giving over a gallon of milk a day.\r\nRains came early in September, the pasturage soon became good again, and\r\nthe daily mess of milk steadily increased until November. By that time\r\nshe was in the stable for the winter, and the treatment since has been\r\npractically a repetition of last year. My root patch in the garden was\r\nenlarged, as the result of last year’s experience, and accordingly I put\r\neight or ten bushels of carrots into my cellar in October, covering them\r\nwith sand, and left a fine lot of parsnips in the ground. I began feeding\r\nthe carrots in January, two or three a day, just for a relish; gradually\r\nincreased them, until in February the cow received half a peck or more,\r\nand thus they lasted into March. Then I dried her off, getting the last\r\nmilk to use March twenty-eighth. Grain feeding was stopped the first of\r\nMarch, and she has had none since. After the cow was fully dry, I began\r\non the parsnips, and she is now getting half a peck daily, with all the\r\nhay she will eat. “June” will be fresh again on the twentieth of this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe season has not satisfied me. Not only has the weather been\r\nunfavorable, (we must expect severe summers occasionally,) but I don’t\r\nlike sending the cow to a distant pasture which I can know very little\r\nabout, and where nobody knows how the other animals treat her. I shall\r\nnever do this again if any other arrangement can be made.\r\n\r\nThe account for the year is as follows:\r\n\r\n                      EXPENSES.\r\n\r\n    Interest at 7 per cent. on cost of cow   $4.55\r\n    Hay from last year                        3.00\r\n    2½ tons Timothy Hay @ $18                45.00\r\n    Pasturage and driving                    24.00\r\n    750 lbs.

First, I secured the meadow west\r\nof my lot, renting it from the owner from October first, 1876, until\r\nApril first, this year, for thirty dollars. The acre and a half yielded\r\nabout two tons of hay in 1876, but no rowen; the aftermath was good,\r\nhowever, when I came in possession. The south end of it, although in\r\ngood heart, was weedy and uneven. I drove some strong stakes, and ran a\r\nwire fence across, in continuation of my southern boundary, thus cutting\r\noff just about a quarter of an acre in rear of my neighbor, south. This\r\npiece I dressed with compost made the summer just preceding, and had it\r\nplowed and cross-plowed before the ground froze, in preparation for a\r\nroot crop. The soil is a deep, mellow, sandy loam, but rich. Last spring\r\nthe new root patch was plowed once, well dressed from the compost pile of\r\n1875-6, and that harrowed in. (There was enough of the same compost for\r\nmy garden, and to spare, so last June there was still on hand the manure\r\nof about a year’s collection put up in good shape.) The rest of the work\r\nI was able to do myself. My root-garden, laid out in rows running north\r\nand south, was divided as follows: eight square rods of parsnips next\r\nto neighbor, south, on the slope, where they caught the wash from his\r\ngarden; twelve square rods of carrots and ten rods of mangolds; in the\r\npoint west to the stream I put sweet corn at first, and followed it with\r\nstrap-leafed turnips, ten square rods. Without going into the details of\r\nroot-culture, which any one who has made a good garden knows all about,\r\nI put into my house cellar last fall fifty-two bushels of Long Orange\r\nCarrots, and over forty bushels of Long Yellow Mangel Wurzels (these\r\nmonstrous, twisted, forked roots are awkward things to measure, but\r\nthere must have been a ton or more in weight), left in the ground from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five bushels of Hollow-crowned Parsnips, and harvested\r\nthirty-six bushels of English Turnips. This was more than I had bargained\r\nfor. I see now that roots enough might have been raised in my old garden,\r\nand the parsnips would have done much better there, but I sold twenty\r\nbushels each of carrots and turnips for more than enough to cover all\r\nexpenditures for seed and hired labor.\r\n\r\nA year ago to-day, I turned “June” into her new pasture of an acre and a\r\nquarter; the grass was then starting well, and I preferred to have the\r\nchange gradual. She ate more or less hay until the end of the month.\r\nDoors and gates were so fixed that she could be in stall, yard, or\r\npasture at pleasure, and could drink at the stream bordering the meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVING AND AFTER-TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of May, her bag began to swell, and became feverish.\r\nA quart or two of watery milk was drawn at intervals of eight hours for\r\nthe next three days, and the udder was bathed as often in tepid water,\r\nand gently but thoroughly rubbed with goose oil, in which camphor-gum\r\nhad been dissolved. Each day, also, she was given a quarter of a pound\r\nof Epsom Salts, dissolved in a quart of “tea” made from poke-weed root\r\n(_Phytolacca decandra_), which all druggists now keep in store; this\r\nwas administered as a “drench,” from a bottle, her head being held up\r\nwhile she swallowed it. On the morning of the twenty-second, being two\r\ndays overdue, she calved, having a hard time, but producing without help\r\na fine large heifer. Very soon after, I gave her a bucket of cool (not\r\ncold) water, in which was stirred a quart of wheat bran, a half pound of\r\nlinseed-meal, previously scalded, and a handful of pulverized poke or\r\ngarget root. This mess was repeated at noon, and the bag milked dry. A\r\nlittle later, the after-birth naturally passed off and was removed. The\r\nudder remained hot, knotty, and so tender that when the calf sucked I had\r\nto protect it from the mother’s kicks, and also to prevent it from taking\r\none teat which was extremely sore. From this quarter I carefully drew the\r\nmilk with one of a set of four “milking-tubes,” which I bought two years\r\nago to do my milking, but soon discarded; here they came in use, just the\r\nthing wanted, but one as good as four. At night I milked dry, gave a dose\r\nof half a pound of Salts, with one ounce of Nitre, and a warm Bran-mash.\r\nThe bag was well rubbed as before. The cow ate some hay during the night,\r\nand a few cabbage sprouts in the morning. That day (twenty-third), she\r\nwas on the pasture a little while, and had a full bag of milk, but still\r\nhot and tender. The calf was separated from the cow at daylight, and\r\nallowed to suck four times during the day, the bag being milked dry, and\r\nthen oiled and well rubbed every time. The bowels appearing to be in a\r\nsufficiently active state, appetite improving, and her eyes natural, the\r\nphysic was discontinued, the cow allowed to eat grass and hay at will,\r\nand for several days the calf sucked at daylight, noon, and dark, the\r\nmilk left by it being all drawn. The bag was rubbed and anointed two or\r\nthree times a day, and a little extract of Belladonna added to the oil\r\nused. Under this treatment the inflammation gradually subsided. As soon\r\nas the cow would allow her calf to take the tenderest teat, I kept it on\r\nthat side as much as possible while sucking. At the end of a week after\r\ncalving, the udder was again in sound condition. The calf was kept until\r\nthe first of June, and then the owner of its sire took it in full for\r\nservice of bull three seasons. We then began to get the full flow of\r\nmilk, and the pasture being good, it was a fine mess daily. At that time,\r\nI began to measure the milk, and have done so ever since. “June” gave\r\nfour hundred and eighty-two quarts the month she was five years old, an\r\naverage of sixteen quarts a day.\r\n\r\nUntil the last of July, the cow got all her food from the pasture, and\r\none acre would have done as well as one and a quarter. For the next\r\nfive or six weeks, the grass was hardly sufficient; it was, for this\r\nperiod, based upon the experience of August, 1876, that the corn had\r\nbeen provided. The ten rods of Mammoth Sweet, three hundred and fifty to\r\nfour hundred hills, had been put in at five different plantings, a week\r\napart, and the earliest was just forming ears the last of July when I\r\nbegan using it, at first once a day, then twice. For each feed, the whole\r\nplants of three or four hills were taken, and chopped in a straw-cutter,\r\nears and all, into two-inch lengths. This was eaten with great relish,\r\nand during August the cow spent most of the daytime standing in the\r\nstream where shaded by trees and grazed at night. The pasturage improved\r\nagain before the corn gave out, so quite a nice piece of winter fodder\r\nwas saved from the piece. Then all through September there was every day\r\nmore or less of green-corn husks, carrot and beet tops, other vegetable\r\nand fruit trimmings, clean refuse from house and garden, good food for\r\nthe cow, so that again one acre of pasture would have sufficed. During\r\nOctober, the carrots and mangolds were harvested, and their tops gave the\r\ncow more than she could manage. I also began feeding turnips the last\r\nof October, a few with mangel tops at first, increasing until she ate\r\nmore than half a bushel a day, tops and all. Before the ground froze,\r\nthe turnips were piled in the barn, without trimming, and covered with\r\nhay; were kept safely until the last were fed, November twenty-eighth.\r\nThe problem of winter feeding really came up the first of November. I\r\nhad a large supply of roots on hand of my own raising, and the hay and\r\ngrain to buy. So I went to the books, and after studying both practice\r\nand science, decided upon the following daily rations for the next six\r\nmonths: November first to May first, fifteen pounds of meadow rowen and\r\nclover hay, in about equal parts; one pound each of coarse wheat bran and\r\ncorn-meal, mixed. During November, one-half bushel turnips and two pounds\r\ncotton-seed meal; December and January, one-half bushel carrots and one\r\nand one-half pound cotton-seed meal; February and March, one-half bushel\r\n(or more) of mangels and one pound cotton-seed meal; April, one-half\r\nbushel parsnips and one and one-half pounds cotton-seed meal; also, one\r\nhundred pounds additional hay, and my corn-stalks, for February and March.\r\n\r\nThis plan has been carried out with little variation. Of course the\r\nfood has not been accurately weighed daily. The grain portions, kept in\r\nbarrels, have been dipped out with tin cups, but have held out just about\r\nas expected; the quantity of hay and roots has been guessed at.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD OF FEEDING\r\n\r\nand other work at the stable during the winter has been this: Between\r\nsix and seven o’clock A. M. stall cleaned, cow brushed off, bedding and\r\nabsorbents fixed, the milking done, and then a feed of six or seven\r\npounds of chaffed hay, slightly moistened, and the bran and meal mixed\r\nwith it. After this, a bucket of water left in the stall, except in the\r\ncoldest weather. The bucket is fixed near the feed-box, so it can not\r\nbe tipped over, and it has generally been found empty at noon. At that\r\nhour, the regular watering, two or three pailfuls, and then a small bunch\r\nof hay thrown in the box; the stall cleaned also. Between six and seven\r\nat night, the milking done and bedding fixed, the roots fed, chopped up\r\npretty fine with a spade, and the cotton-seed meal sprinkled over them.\r\nHay then given, and the cow left for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to feed the roots in two parts, morning and night,\r\nand I should have preferred this, but my time in the morning was limited.\r\nPreparing the roots over night, they sometimes froze, but I could cut the\r\nhay at evening, ready for the morning chop-feed. As one kind of root was\r\nabout to give out, some of the next to be fed were mixed in, and thus\r\nsudden changes avoided. The extra hay and stalks calculated for February\r\nand March were not used exactly in those months, but consumed during\r\nseverely cold and windy spells, being added to the usual noon and night\r\nportions. At all times, the cow had, under this plan, full as much as\r\nshe was ready to eat up clean. The hay left on hand a year ago was all\r\nused last summer, and before November a full load each of the best rowen\r\nand clover hay were put into the barn, one thousand six hundred and one\r\nthousand four hundred pounds respectively, and there is a little left.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be mentioned that while the cow was mainly fed on sweet\r\ncorn, last July and August, I was obliged to add about two pounds of\r\ncotton-seed meal a day, to give quality to the milk; it was fed dry, at\r\nnoon. As soon as the feeding of carrot tops began, this meal was omitted,\r\nbut it was again needed when turnips were substituted for carrot and beet\r\ntops. The ration of mangolds was increased to about two bushels in three\r\ndays, because there were plenty of them, and my house cellar being rather\r\nwarm, they commenced to rot. I was very careful to give the cow only\r\nsound roots. This extra food in February and March resulted in a better\r\nmilk record by “June” than in the two months next preceding. I shall feed\r\nmore roots the coming year. There were more parsnips than could be well\r\nused; they were not needed until April, and I sold five dollars’ worth,\r\nas an offset to what the cow got from last year’s kitchen garden. The cow\r\ngoes on to pasture to-day.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in review, the cow has been carried through the year with the\r\none and one-half acres rented for thirty dollars, and forty-five dollars\r\nexpended for hay and grain. Against the manure taken for my garden\r\nmay be placed the cleanings of the poultry house, the contents of the\r\nearth-closet, and the garden refuse and bedding, all of which go into\r\nthe compost heap. The item of labor alone remains, and as all that has\r\nbeen hired (including the plowing of the garden) was paid from sales of\r\nsurplus roots, no further account is taken of that; my own time was well\r\nspent, as the balance sheet shows. Last August, we fully determined that\r\nit would be better for the family cow to be fresh in September than in\r\nthe spring. The heat of summer is the time when it is most difficult to\r\nkeep a cow properly fed for a good flow of rich milk on a little place\r\nlike this. It is the time when milk is plenty and cheap, if one wants to\r\nbuy, and most difficult to manage or dispose of if one has much on hand.\r\nIt is almost impossible to make good butter in dog-days, living as we\r\ndo, with no special appliances, and it is not worth while for us to get\r\na patent creamer and a supply of ice. In the spring, we don’t want a dry\r\ncow, but are willing to have one in August. July, with its increasing\r\nheat and decreasing pasturage, is a favorable time to dry off a cow. The\r\nkeeper of one cow can not afford to have her dry more than six weeks in\r\nthe year, and may manage to have this period four weeks, or even less.\r\nAccordingly, I have arranged for “June” to come in next September, and\r\nshall in future practice “winter-dairying.” Indeed, we have done so the\r\npast season, for with liberal feeding of a succulent character, the cow\r\nhas held out well in her milk. She is now giving between five and six\r\nquarts a day, while not yet on grass, and her total yield for eleven\r\nmonths, since June first (or rather for the year), is found to be two\r\nthousand seven hundred and forty-six quarts.

The yield of the cow shows “June” to be a superior animal, and\r\nthat is what the keeper of one cow should have, for it costs little more\r\nin food and care than an ordinary one. But if the cow had been only\r\nof medium quality and no new milk could be sold, it would have been a\r\nprofitable operation. And if, instead of selling new milk, as much butter\r\nhad been made as possible, there would still have resulted a balance of\r\nover twenty dollars in favor of the cow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—PLAN OF VILLAGE LOT AND SURROUNDINGS.]\r\n\r\nMAY 1ST, 1880.—(To come within the required limits of this paper the\r\njournal of the last two years must be condensed. Therefore, omitting\r\ndetailed descriptions, the general facts are given, and some opinions\r\nderived from the five years recorded.) For the year ending May, 1879, the\r\nmethod of keeping “June” was much the same as in that last described,\r\nbut more roots were raised and fed; some hay was made, and only straw\r\nand grain food purchased. The result was even better than that shown by\r\nthe last account. During the year just ended, the fifth since “June” was\r\nbought, I tried soiling, keeping the cow in stall and yard almost all\r\nthe time, and have actually got through without buying hay or straw,\r\nusing only one acre and a quarter to produce all the long forage needed.\r\nThere is so much left over that I am satisfied one acre well managed,\r\nthe preparation beginning the previous fall, can be made to support my\r\ncow, with the exception of the grain food and part of the roots. But\r\nthis requires more time for labor than I can give, and more manure than\r\none cow makes. I have had to buy fertilizers during the last two years,\r\nand although they were good, I prefer hereafter to buy food and make\r\nmanure, rather than buy manures to make food. For one situated as I am, a\r\nsemi-soiling system, or limited pasturage helped out with other food, is\r\nbetter, even if more food is bought. I can be surer of what I purchase,\r\nand thus use the one cow to better advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—EAST END OF STABLE IN 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—PLAN OF STABLE IN 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—SOUTH SIDE OF STABLE AS ADAPTED FOR POULTRY IN\r\n1871-5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—PLAN OF STABLE, 1871-5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 9 and 10.—EAST AND SOUTH ELEVATIONS OF STABLE, AS\r\nCHANGED FOR POULTRY AND COW IN 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—MAIN FLOOR PLAN AS CHANGED FOR COW IN 1875.]\r\n\r\nThe only secret of home-made manure is to save everything, especially all\r\nliquids, mix everything as already explained, fork over and keep compact,\r\nto make a homogenous compost, and keep all under cover until used.

It contains room enough for a year’s\r\nforage, including root-cellar, a warm, dry stall, conveniently arranged\r\nfor saving labor, ample shed-room for compost, and a sheltered yard\r\ncontaining five or six square rods, which is as good as more. There is\r\nrunning water in the yard. The plans accompanying this article, figs. 5\r\nto 13 inclusive, show these arrangements better than any description in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n“June” had her fifth calf September sixth, 1878, and her sixth exactly\r\na year later. At the fifth calving there was a “false presentation,”\r\nand a very serious time. No competent veterinarian was within reach,\r\nor else one would have been called. As it was, I looked up the subject\r\nin back volumes of agricultural papers and other publications, went to\r\nwork myself, and getting the calf into proper position, succeeded in\r\neffecting a delivery without serious consequences. Last September’s calf\r\nwas a heifer, and by a fine sire, so, as “June” has reached her prime, if\r\nnot passed it, I am raising this calf to make a new cow to succeed the\r\nworthy dam. Most keepers of one cow, however, are so situated that they\r\nhad better dispose of calves at once. Making veal is not as profitable as\r\nmaking butter, and feeding skim-milk to children and chickens.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the products of the cow perfectly satisfactory, I lay\r\ngreat stress upon the utmost care and cleanliness in milking. First,\r\nsee that the stall and all about it is in order, pure air, and no dust\r\nflying, and the udder and flank of the cow quite clean. Except in the\r\ncoldest weather, the udder is sponged off with tepid water, and wiped\r\ndry, just before milking. Then I trust no one to milk for me, but do it\r\nmyself, quietly, quickly, and completely, milking into a funnel, which\r\ncarries the fluid to a covered pail, which serves also a seat. This new\r\nand truly “Perfect” milking-pail, which I first saw described in the\r\nAMERICAN AGRICULTURIST, is a great improvement on all open vessels. I\r\nprefer not to have the cow eating while I milk; she should give her whole\r\nattention to the operation, as well as the milker. This certainty that\r\nmy milk reaches the house absolutely pure, not only satisfies us as to\r\nour own cream and butter, but makes “June’s” milk in great demand in the\r\nneighborhood. Our neighbors so much prefer it to milkmen’s milk that they\r\nare willing to send to the house for it, and pay more than the usual\r\nvillage price. This adds materially to the profit of keeping one cow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—THE GUERNSEY COW “LADY JANE” AND HEIFER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH EARNEST AND HIS COW “COMFORT.”\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE WESTERN RESERVE.\r\n\r\nBY S. B. MORRIS, CHARLESTOWN, PORTAGE CO., O.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe luxury of having fresh milk, cream, and butter, may be enjoyed by\r\nevery family in city, town, or hamlet, that can provide a cow with the\r\nnecessaries expressed in one word—comfort. To show what may be done\r\nin this respect, allow me to give somewhat of the history of Joseph\r\nEarnest. Joseph’s father was a carpenter, and never kept a horse or cow.\r\nAfter giving his son the best education he could receive at the common\r\nschool, he kept him at work with himself until Joseph also became a\r\nmaster carpenter. At the time our story commences, he is married and\r\nhas a family of three children, a girl of eight, a boy of six years,\r\nand a baby. By industry, economy, and good habits, he had accumulated\r\nsufficient means to purchase a half-acre lot in the outskirts of a\r\nflourishing manufacturing town. Upon this lot he had built a small but\r\ncomfortable house. His wife, the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, having\r\na little property of her own, invested it in the vacant lot adjoining\r\nthem. The winter previous Joseph had put up a building which was to\r\nserve the double purpose of barn and workshop. The barn for his visiting\r\nfriends, the workshop for himself. Back of this building, and adjacent to\r\nit, was a small hennery in which were kept a few fowls; at one side was a\r\nshed for his gardening implements. Everything about the premises showed\r\nthe owner was neat and orderly, as well as thrifty, while within the snug\r\ncottage the same virtues reigned supreme. Many a time did Mary look back\r\nto the old home-life on the farm, and think of the plentiful products of\r\nthe dairy. Then she would say to Joseph, “How I wish we could keep a cow.\r\nIt seems as though I cannot half cook with only one quart of milk a day,\r\nand the children would be so much healthier if they could have what milk\r\nthey want.” Joseph agreed with her, and would add, “But you know Mary\r\nwe cannot raise our own vegetables and fruit, and keep a cow, with only\r\none acre of land.” Imagine her surprise, when, after a short absence one\r\nmorning, Joseph returned leading a cow. He was soon surrounded by his\r\nfamily and plied with questions, such as: Whose is she? Where did you\r\nget her? What will you do with her? In answer to these questions Joseph\r\nreplied, “I went over to Mr. Durham’s this morning, to see if he could\r\npay me what was back on the work I did for him last fall. I found him\r\nfeeding his cattle and made known my errand. He said he had no money at\r\npresent, but was wanting to sell a cow, and as soon as he could would pay\r\nme. I asked him which cow he wanted to sell; he pointed out this one,\r\nwhich was smaller than the others and seemed driven by them. Not a very\r\nlarge cow, he said, but young, with some Jersey blood in her—better for\r\na family cow than for a factory cow. I say Earnest, she is just what you\r\nneed, with your family. But I’ve no place to put her, said I, and I don’t\r\nknow how to take care of a cow. Nonsense, said he, put her in your stable\r\nfor the present, and you’ll learn how to take care of her fast enough.\r\nBut what shall I feed her? Why the money you pay Churchill for milk,\r\nwith what you can raise on your lot, will keep your cow right along, and\r\ninstead of one quart a day, you’ll have all the milk and cream and butter\r\nyou want to use, and some to spare, and, Mary, I thought it wouldn’t\r\nbreak us up if it didn’t prove a success, so I took the cow on what he\r\nwas owing me—twenty five dollars—and here she is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Joseph, I am so glad you bought her, I do believe we can keep her,”\r\nsaid Mary, “how gentle she seems,”—for during the talk the children\r\nhad been petting the cow, who appeared well pleased with her new\r\nacquaintances. The baby partaking of the general animation, crowed with\r\ndelight, as though already anticipating the good time coming.\r\n\r\n“She has behaved like a baby coming over here,” said Joseph, “and I\r\ndeclare I begin to love her already. I have always wished we could live\r\nwhere we could have animals around us, and perhaps we will some day.”\r\nMary said she hoped they could, for she felt lonesome for them. “But what\r\nshall we name our cow? For my part I would like to call her ‘Comfort,’\r\nand while she contributes to our comfort we will endeavor to do the same\r\nfor her.” Joseph agreed to the name, saying he needed plenty to eat and\r\ndrink, a good bed and pleasant home, and he believed that animals did\r\ntoo, so he would give her one of his nice roomy stalls in his barn, make\r\nher a bed of shavings from the shop until he could do better. “We have\r\npure water for her to drink, with hay and vegetables to eat, and that\r\nwill keep her alive until we learn what she will thrive on best.” As this\r\nwas a “broken” day, he thought they had better get neighbor Manning’s\r\nhorse and carry-all, and drive out to father Granger’s. He had always\r\nbeen a good farmer and could tell him just how to care for the cow. All\r\nwere delighted with this plan and were soon enjoying a six-mile drive\r\ninto the country.\r\n\r\nHe learned that a cow would eat almost anything that grows, but that\r\njudgment and experience was needed in feeding to produce the best\r\nresults. Father Granger said they could keep a cow as well as not, and\r\nbetter too, and Joseph began to believe it. At the suggestion of father\r\nG. he borrowed a bag, and on his way home stopped at the grist mill and\r\nhad it filled with bran, which the old gentleman said was about the best\r\nfeed for a cow just before coming in. After arriving home “Comfort”\r\nreceived a feed of hay and a quart of bran—had a drink of fresh water,\r\nher stable cleaned, some fresh shavings given her for a bedding, and\r\nwith kind pats and words was left for the night. In the evening bedding\r\nwas talked over. Joseph thought he would get the privilege of gathering\r\nleaves from a wood lot about one half mile distant, but Mary thought\r\nthey would be too wet at this season, then sawdust was suggested, but\r\nthat was not quite the thing they concluded, that is, if they could\r\nthink of anything better. To be perfect it must be comfortable for the\r\ncow to stand or lie upon, it must be an absorbent of liquid manure, and\r\nsomething that would add to the value of the compost heap, and would\r\neasily decompose. Suddenly Joseph exclaimed, “I have it, just the thing.\r\nYou remember I went out to N. last fall to do a job of work for Charlie\r\nCurtiss’s brother, and when he came to bring me home, with my tools, he\r\nput a large top box on his wagon box, and also put in a number of sacks.\r\nI asked him what he was going to bring home and he said ‘oat shucks’ to\r\nbed his cows with—that the shucks were dry and bulky, and for fifty cents\r\nyou could get all you could draw at a load. He said it was the best and\r\ncheapest bedding he could get, and much more than paid for itself in the\r\nvalue of the manure. That is just what we want, and I will get Charlie to\r\ndraw me a load to-morrow.” So the next night “Comfort” laid down for the\r\nfirst time in her life on a “first-class” bed of oat shucks, while the\r\nadjoining stall was filled full for future use.\r\n\r\n“Joseph, what are you going to do with that lumber Charlie left here\r\nto-day?” said Mary, a few evenings later. “Well I have been thinking\r\n‘Comfort’ ought to have a little yard where she can walk around and enjoy\r\nthe sunshine and fresh air. I am going to build a fence from the farther\r\ncorner of the hennery to the fence on the back side of the lot, and one\r\nfrom the corner of the shed back, and that will make her a good yard.\r\nThose two English cherry trees will come in it and furnish shade for her\r\nin the hottest weather.”\r\n\r\nAnother evening, as Joseph came home from work, Mary asked, “What in the\r\nworld are you going to do with these,” as she drew from the bundle a card\r\nand brush. “Which of the family are you going to use these on?”—“Oh, I\r\nthought they would be good things to have in the house,” said Joseph,\r\nlaughing. “You know I started out early this morning to go around by\r\nMason’s, to see about repairing his house this next summer. He is one\r\nof the best of farmers, all his stock look thrifty—everything is up in\r\norder, and he makes farming pay. I found him in the stable carding and\r\nbrushing his cows. That was a new idea to me, and I asked him if he\r\nthought it really paid him to spend so much time and labor on his cows.\r\nWell, said he, I’ve had the care of cattle nigh on to thirty years, and I\r\nthink my carding and brushing pay as well as anything I can do, and there\r\nis nothing an animal enjoys more than having its coat combed.”\r\n\r\n“What did Mr. Mason say about the work.”—“He is going to have his house\r\nthoroughly repaired, and I am glad to say your husband has the job, and\r\nhe is going to keep his eyes and ears open and learn what he can about\r\nfarming.”\r\n\r\nJoseph had bought a load of fine hay a farmer was taking into town to\r\nmarket, and “Comfort” was now fed hay three times a day, with two quarts\r\nof bran night and morning. At noon there was something from the house\r\nalso, like potato and apple peelings, small potatoes, wilted turnips or\r\nbeets, cut up cabbage leaves, etc. The children thought it nice fun to\r\nfeed her at noon. Some loose bars had been put up to her stall which\r\nwas quite roomy, and she did not have to be driven into it by some of\r\nthe men and all of the boys in the neighborhood, but when the gate of\r\nthe yard was opened she walked briskly to her stall, knowing she would\r\nfind a good supper waiting for her. Humane care, the plenty of food and\r\ndrink, given regularly, have wrought in a month’s time a great change\r\nin the appearance of “Comfort.” From being a poorly fed “whipped” cow\r\nin a dairy, suffering all the discomfort of stanchions for eighteen out\r\nof twenty-four hours, with no bed but a bare floor—she has come to be a\r\nthrifty, happy animal, giving good promise of rewarding her owners well\r\nfor their care. One morning the first week in April, Joseph came in from\r\nthe barn looking pleased, but a little anxious. “Children,” he said,\r\n“what do you think I found at the barn this morning?”—“Oh, a bossy,” they\r\nsaid, delighted with the idea.—“Yes, ‘Comfort’ has a little ‘comfort,’\r\nand she is very proud of it; but now comes the rub, who is to milk, and\r\nwhat is to be done with the calf?”—“Oh,” said Mary, “I guess I have not\r\nquite forgotten how to milk yet, and you can soon learn—‘never too old\r\nto learn,’ you know. I will go out after breakfast and milk out what the\r\ncalf does not take, and you can go around by Mr. Mason’s and ask him what\r\nwe had better do with the calf.” Joseph felt these were good suggestions,\r\nand after standing by Mary, in more than one sense, while she performed\r\nher part of the programme—which was successfully accomplished—he started\r\nfor work by way of farmer Mason’s. Arriving there he made known his\r\nerrand. “Well,” said Mr. M., “you can ‘deacon’ it or veal it. Don’t\r\nmany but dairymen follow the first way, and I should advise you to let\r\nit have all the milk it wants for four or five weeks, and the butcher\r\nwill take it and pay you five or six dollars. Put the calf by itself,\r\nand night and morning let it go to the cow and get its own milk.” When\r\nJoseph arrived home that evening, he partitioned off a corner of the\r\nbarn with some barrels and boxes, put in some bedding, and put the calf\r\nin his new quarters. Then he tried his hand at milking, Mary standing\r\nby him this time, telling him what to do, and laughing a little at his\r\nawkward efforts, yet encouraging him by saying he did splendidly for the\r\nfirst trial. “Comfort” rewarded him for his kindness to her, by being\r\nvery patient with his awkwardness, and he daily improved in the art of\r\nmilking, so that while vealy was getting his fill, he would get about two\r\nor three quarts as his share.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of April Joseph commenced work for Mr. Mason, and as his\r\nwork-bench was at one end of the barn floor, he had a good opportunity\r\nfor observation. He noticed Mr. M. fed his cows corn meal, and asked\r\nhim what feed he considered best for cows giving milk at this time of\r\nthe year. Mr. M. said, in his experience he had found there were three\r\nthings to be considered in the care of cows. Health of the cow, quantity\r\nand quality of the milk. Plenty of wholesome food and pure water (also a\r\nlittle salt each day), given regularly, out of door exercise in pleasant\r\nweather, and general good care will give the first. “Clover hay, corn\r\nfodder, wheat bran or ground oats, with some roots, will keep up the flow\r\nof milk,” said he, “but if you want thick cream, and plenty of golden\r\nbutter, feed your cow corn meal. When my cows are in milk and kept on dry\r\nfeed, I give each cow daily, morning and evening, four quarts of mixed\r\nfeed, one part, by weight, of wheat bran and two parts of corn meal, with\r\nabout one tablespoonful of salt. We make more and better butter on this\r\nfeed than when the cows have grass only.”\r\n\r\nJoseph, having no experience of his own, was glad to use that of others\r\nin regard to his cow, so from this time he began feeding “Comfort” corn\r\nmeal, beginning with a pint and increasing gradually to one quart;\r\nthe result being plainly seen in the improved quality of the milk and\r\ncondition of the calf. When this was five weeks old the butcher took it\r\naway giving five dollars for it, and seemed much pleased with his bargain.\r\n\r\nThat evening Joseph figured a little. He found his bran and corn meal had\r\ncost three dollars and fifty-five cents, so there was a balance of one\r\ndollar and forty-five cents from the calf to pay on the hay. They had\r\nhad from three to four quarts of milk per day, of better quality than\r\nthat they could have bought for six cents a quart. Thirty days, three and\r\none-half quarts a day, at six cents a quart, is six dollars and thirty\r\ncents. By stabling and bedding the cow, quite a quantity of good manure\r\nhad accumulated, and Joseph felt very well satisfied, so far, with his\r\nexperiment, and most of all for the luxury of having good sweet milk for\r\nthe family use. It was now the middle of May, grass was well started,\r\nand as there were farms near them, it was thought best to hire pasture\r\nfor the summer. By inquiry they found she could be pastured one-fourth\r\nmile from home. This seemed too far to carry the milk, and would take too\r\nmuch time to drive back and forth twice a day. “Why not keep her at home\r\nnights, and feed her something as we do now,” said Mary; “she will be\r\nglad to come home then. Father always feeds his cows bran in the summer;\r\nhe says it pays in their ‘coming up’ if in nothing else. He goes to the\r\ngate and calls ‘come boss,’ and they all start as quickly as if he had\r\nsaid, ‘come to supper,’ and it is that to them.” So it was decided to\r\nkeep “Comfort” home nights. In a few days “Comfort” was introduced to her\r\nsummer range, and quickly learned the way to and from the pasture, and\r\nthe children thought it a great pleasure to drive her to and fro.\r\n\r\n“Joseph,” said Mary, about this time, “what shall we do with the sour\r\nmilk? The neighbors will take some of it at two cents a quart, but the\r\ndemand is irregular, and it don’t seem right to throw it away. Don’t you\r\nthink we better get a pig?”—“Perhaps so; as we are in for experiments\r\nthis year we might try that also. Mason has some nice pigs—two kinds. One\r\nkind make large growthy animals, the other kind are smaller but finer,\r\nand would be best for us, I think.” Soon a pig was added to their farm\r\nstock. Joseph declared he would not try to live without a cow again if\r\nit cost twice as much to take care of her. “Why we didn’t know what good\r\nliving was until ‘Comfort’ came to live with us, did we, children?”—“No,\r\nindeed, only when we went to grand-pa’s.”—“Look at this baby,” said Mary,\r\n“she never was so well before, and she is getting as rosy and round as\r\na Maidenblush apple. You can’t think what a help the milk is to me in\r\ncooking. I can always have something fresh and nice now, and it will\r\nlessen our meat bill too.”\r\n\r\nSome of the neighbors wanted to buy milk; “Comfort” was giving sixteen\r\nquarts a day. So four neighboring families were supplied each with one\r\nquart of milk a day, and after a week’s trial Mary reported she had made\r\nfive pounds of butter that was worth twenty cents per pound, grocery\r\nprice. They had sold twenty-eight quarts of milk at six cents a quart,\r\nbutter and milk amounting to two dollars and sixty-eight cents, and\r\nthey had used all the sweet milk, cream, sour milk and butter-milk they\r\nneeded, and the pig had been kept on the surplus of the last two. Joseph\r\nwas now feeding “Comfort” as Mr. Mason advised, with corn meal and bran,\r\ntwo-thirds of the former and one-third of the latter by weight, giving\r\nthree quarts of the mixture night and morning. Corn meal cost one cent\r\nper pound, bran cost two-thirds of a cent a pound, the cost of the feed\r\nper day being a fraction over seven cents. He also gave her a little\r\nhay—to the value of say ten cents a week—pasture cost twenty-five cents\r\na week, so the expense of her keeping was eighty-five cents a week,\r\nthe work offsetting the milk used, left a profit of one dollar and\r\neighty-three cents. There was another item not to be overlooked. The\r\nmanure that was accumulating, the value of which was largely increased\r\nby the ground feed given the cow, and the oat shuck bedding. Of the acre\r\nof land about one-quarter was occupied with buildings, walks, shrubbery,\r\na small lawn in front, and flower garden at the side of the house, but\r\nevery foot of intervening space was well seeded to grass, so it really\r\nmade quite a little mowing. Another quarter had been set out to fruit\r\ntrees five years, and was now well stocked with red clover, the remaining\r\none-half acre had been used as a garden and potato patch. With the\r\nexception of a few loads of manure, obtained at different places, no\r\nfertilizer had been used on this acre of land. But now having gone into\r\nthe stock business, Joseph began to read and think about such things. He\r\nfrequently brought home an agricultural paper from Mr. Mason’s to read in\r\nthe evening, and began also to feel he must have one of his own. He found\r\nconsiderable in the papers about commercial fertilizers, so he asked Mr.\r\nMason if he had ever used any of them. He said he had experimented with\r\nthem considerably, and thought them excellent helps. “I have never,”\r\nsaid he, “paid out money for anything that came back as quickly with as\r\ngood profit, as superphosphates. These and other fertilizers must be used\r\nwith judgment to get the best returns, but on gravelly soil, with a clay\r\nsubsoil like ours here, it pays well.” Joseph also asked Mr. M. what he\r\ncould raise on his lot to the best advantage for his cow. “I should say\r\nsowed corn and mangel wurzels. You see this little lot at the back of the\r\nbarn, it is ten square rods, and very rich ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN FODDER.\r\n\r\n“I sow this to corn in drills about this time (the last of May), so that\r\nit gets well tasseled by the time pastures begin to get rather dry, as\r\nthey usually do after the middle of summer, then I begin to feed, and\r\nit helps keep up the flow of milk amazingly. It is a sweet, juicy and\r\nnutritious feed, just the thing for cows. Let me calculate a little. Why\r\nEarnest, if your land could be made to produce like this piece, you can\r\nraise coarse fodder enough for your cow for six months, on thirty square\r\nrods of ground. I like some roots for cows—we like a variety of food, so\r\ndo animals. The best roots I know of to raise for stock are sugar beets\r\nor the mangels.”\r\n\r\nVery soon after this conversation Joseph had his half acre of land plowed\r\ndeep and in narrow furrows, as he had seen recommended in agricultural\r\npapers. The manure that had accumulated from the cow was used for a\r\ntop-dressing for one half of the plowed portion. This was well harrowed,\r\nand three-fourths of it lightly furrowed with the plow, two and one half\r\nfeet apart. The remaining one-fourth was turned into ridges as close as\r\nthe furrows could be turned together. His team work was now done for the\r\npresent on this part of his lot especially set apart for his cow. (The\r\nother half of the plowed lot was to be used for his main family garden,\r\nhe having spaded up some beds for early vegetables.) He had provided\r\nhimself with seed corn from farmer Mason’s, some mangel wurzel seed from\r\nthe seed store, and also a bag of two hundred pounds of phosphate, of\r\na brand recommended by Mr. M. The phosphate was sprinkled in the plow\r\nmarks, at the rate of three hundred pounds to the acre, as near as could\r\nbe judged, the soil in the bottom of the furrow was lightly stirred\r\nwith a four pronged potato hook, the corn was sprinkled in, about eight\r\nkernels to the foot [sixteen to twenty is better—Ed.,] and covered about\r\ntwo inches deep. One half of the piece designed for corn was planted, and\r\nthe other half left to be treated in the same way some two weeks later.\r\nThe top was raked off the ridges designed for the mangels. A furrow was\r\nmade on each with a hand hoe, and phosphate sprinkled in rather more\r\nliberally than for the corn. This was thoroughly mixed with the soil, the\r\nfurrow becoming nearly level with the surface. A line was drawn by which\r\na light mark was made with the end of the hoe handle, in which the mangel\r\nseeds were sown and covered about one inch deep, the soil being pressed\r\ndown lightly with the hoe. After saving enough phosphate for the balance\r\nof the corn, and a little to experiment with on some late potatoes, the\r\nremainder was sown broadcast on the clover. It fell a little short of\r\ncovering the whole, and Joseph thought that would make a good opportunity\r\nto test its virtues. His seeds came up well, and, as he had all he could\r\nattend to nights and mornings, he hired a neighbor to do his farm work,\r\nand he determined no weeds should have the benefit of his fertilizers or\r\nsoil; and this part of his programme was thoroughly carried out during\r\nthe growing season.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER QUARTERS.\r\n\r\nIn “Comfort’s” yard was a corner formed by the barn on one side, the\r\nhennery on another, and the board fence on a third side. Joseph put\r\na roof over this corner, and about a foot deep of oatshucks on the\r\nground, and fastened a box to the side of the barn for her to eat out\r\nof; and here were her summer quarters. Every morning before milking the\r\ndroppings were cleaned up and piled in one corner of the yard. As soon\r\nas the clover began to blossom, an armful was cut each evening and fed\r\nto “Comfort” after her ration of dry feed, and the morning feed was\r\ndiscontinued. After the corn was large enough, that took the place of\r\nclover until frost threatened; then it was cut up and bound in small\r\nbundles, which were set up in large stooks, to cure for winter use.\r\n\r\nNo difference was observed in the first crop of clover in favor of the\r\nphosphate, but the second cutting was largely benefited by its use. Over\r\none-half of the first and second cuttings were cured and stored in the\r\nbarn, with all of the grass around the yard, which, with fully two-thirds\r\nof the stalks, would be nearly, if not quite enough coarse feed to last\r\n“Comfort” through the winter. The mangels yielded about twenty-five\r\nbushels, not a very large yield, but quite satisfactory, considering the\r\nsoil had not really been farmed but one year. The roots were pitted near\r\nthe barn for spring use. Some of the corn stalks were set so as to form\r\na slanting roof over them; three or four inches of dirt thrown over\r\nthis; afterwards enough to keep them from freezing.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of November, “Comfort” was established in winter quarters\r\nin the stall, at night and during stormy days, and in the yard on\r\npleasant days. She continued in milk until the middle of February, and\r\nwas in fresh milk March eighteenth, was hearty and contented—a comfort\r\nto look at as well as to own. Joseph Earnest was well pleased with his\r\nyear’s experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nIt is now three years since he brought comfort to his home in more ways\r\nthan one. His little farm is improving every year in fertility and value,\r\nand even now blossoms like a thing of beauty. Some of his neighbors have\r\nfollowed his example, for he tells them:\r\n\r\n“Any one who has a place to put a cow can keep one with profit, if he\r\nwill make her comfortable; that it matters not whether protection from\r\nthe weather is secured by logs, straw, sods, rough boards, or planed\r\nboards well painted. She must have exercise, sunshine, and fresh air.\r\nThese can be obtained in a small dry yard, kept clean, as well as in\r\n‘Uncle Sam’s’ pasture, the open prairie. She must have something of a\r\nvariety of wholesome food, and a plentiful supply of pure water. No\r\ndomestic animal, in proportion to its weight, needs as much water as a\r\nmilch cow. She must be kept clean by litter, card, and brush. If these\r\nrules are observed with judgment and kindness, very seldom will any help\r\nbe needed at time of calving. If anything goes wrong there is no better\r\nrule than to use one’s common sense, taking the advice of experienced\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n“To economize manure, an abundance of good litter should be used, and\r\nthe compost heap kept under cover, if possible; at any rate, not under\r\nthe eaves of the barn. If, with this home-made manure, your land does\r\nnot produce all it can, and you wish to buy some fertilizing material,\r\nyour first choice should be good stable manure; if you cannot get that\r\nreasonably, use some reliable brand of commercial fertilizer. Have your\r\ncow ‘come in’ when it will be most for your profit or convenience,\r\navoiding hot weather. The calf may be killed when one to three days old,\r\nsaving its hide and rennet; it may be kept until five or six weeks old,\r\nfed on new milk, and ‘vealed,’ or sold for that purpose, or it may be\r\nraised on skim-milk (after it is three or four weeks old), and sold in\r\nthe fall to some farmer.\r\n\r\n“Milking should be done gently but quickly, as near twelve hours apart\r\nas possible. Milk clean but do not “strip;” use the whole hand, and not\r\nthe thumb and finger only; sing or whistle, if you want to while milking;\r\nif you are good friends with your cow, she will enjoy it.\r\n\r\n“Since the first year I have not bought any coarse feed, and only a\r\nlittle fertilizer for grass and clover, the cow and pig furnishing all\r\nthat is needed for the plowed ground, and this last year I have a surplus\r\nof feed. I tell you, friends, my cow is the best savings bank I ever\r\nknew.”\r\n\r\nThis and much more said Joseph Earnest to his neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD STABLE “TIE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. D. C. Kenyon, of Carbondale, Pa., describes a convenient home-made\r\nStable Tie as follows: Our tie, of which we send you a miniature sample,\r\nis made of three-eighths inch rope, which is braided into an iron ring\r\nsliding freely up and down a post set close to the manger or feed-box.\r\nThere is a knot or frog on one end, and a loop on the other. The ends\r\npass on each side of the cow’s neck, and the knot is slipped through the\r\nloop which may be made tighter by twisting. Similar fastenings made of\r\nchains with snap hooks may be bought at the hardware stores, but such an\r\none as is here described will last a long time and answer every purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AS COW-FEED.\r\n\r\nBY CHRISTOPHER SHEARER, TUCKERTON, PA.\r\n\r\n\r\nButter and milk are not only luxuries, but in many families they are\r\nindispensable necessaries of life. In this article my principal purpose\r\nis to show how a cow can be kept with the greatest economy of land and\r\nlabor. I consider these the essential points in the discussion. Where hay\r\nis dear and pasture scarce, a man who lives by the labor of his hands,\r\ncannot ordinarily afford to purchase the necessary food for a cow; and\r\nif he has only an acre or two of land at his disposal, he finds it more\r\nprofitable to raise other products. Ordinarily it requires the yield\r\nof several acres of land to support a cow. But I propose to show that\r\nthis can be done on less than one acre, by raising the proper crops,\r\nand treating the soil to the best advantage. A cow of ordinary size\r\nwill consume about eleven thousand pounds of hay, or its equivalent,\r\nin a year. The equivalent of this amount of hay is—in potatoes, thirty\r\nthousand eight hundred pounds, or five hundred and thirteen bushels,\r\nand in Indian corn, seven thousand seven hundred pounds, or one hundred\r\nand thirty-seven bushels. These quantities cannot be raised on one\r\nacre, and if we examine the tables of equivalents of food, we find that\r\nmost of the grasses, grains, and roots, are objectionable on account of\r\nunproductiveness, want of sufficient nutritive qualities, or of the labor\r\nthat the cultivation of them requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a root, or tuber, an acre of which affords enough\r\nnourishment to sustain two cows, with less labor than is employed in\r\nraising an acre of potatoes—and that root is the Jerusalem Artichoke\r\n(_Helianthus tuberosus_). We can depend upon an average yield of from\r\none thousand to one thousand two hundred bushels of these tubers from\r\nan acre of land rich enough to produce fifty bushels of corn. Pound for\r\npound they are equal in nutritive qualities to potatoes. One cow can\r\ntherefore be subsisted a year on five hundred or six hundred bushels of\r\nthe tubers, a quantity that can be raised on half an acre of land. But\r\nsince these roots do not keep over summer, and as the cow will not thrive\r\non them alone, it is necessary to supplement them with dry fodder during\r\nwinter, and to subsist her on other forage during summer. With the aid\r\nof this plant, three-quarters of an acre of land under high cultivation,\r\nwill nourish a cow during the whole year, and the soil will become rich\r\nwithout any other manure than that derived from the cow. This can be done\r\nwith little expense, and with no more labor than is involved in ordinary\r\nfarm culture. It is necessary to begin operations on the farm in most\r\nsections of the Middle States, a little earlier than the first of May.\r\n\r\nA cow can be subsisted to the best advantage on a small patch of land,\r\nby feeding her Jerusalem Artichokes and a little hay or other dry fodder\r\nthrough the winter and part of spring, and soiling her with green rye,\r\nclover, and green-corn fodder, the rest of the year. Three-quarters of an\r\nacre will, under judicious treatment, yield enough of these products to\r\nmaintain a cow during the year. If the soil be not in good condition to\r\nbegin with, that quantity of land may, for a year or two, be insufficient\r\nfor the purpose, and it will then be necessary to supply the deficiency\r\nfrom other sources; but by proper management the land will, in a few\r\nyears, be converted into a garden that will afford abundant nourishment\r\nfor the cow, without pasture or outside aid either in food or manure.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a man owns a cow of medium size, or a little larger, that\r\nhe has three-quarters of an acre of land, that one-third of it, namely,\r\none-quarter of an acre, is in clover, that the remainder is ready for the\r\nplow, and that it is early spring-time of the year, he should go to work\r\nat once and manure the land liberally, for he will be well repaid for\r\nthe expense, in the superior productiveness of the soil. All the land,\r\nexcepting the clover, should be plowed, and one-sixth of the land, that\r\nis one-eighth of an acre, should be sowed with oats, with about one-half\r\nbushel of seed. One quart of clover seed, and one pint of timothy seed\r\nshould be sown on the oats. The oats are raised only during the first\r\nyear, rye being substituted in after years, and the timothy is added for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the hay-crop in the second year. One-third\r\nof the land (one-quarter of an acre) should be planted in Jerusalem\r\nArtichokes, early in the season. This root should be planted in hills,\r\nthree feet apart each way, and cultivated flat, both ways. As the land\r\nincreases in fertility in future years, the hills may be set a little\r\nfarther apart. The patch should be stirred two or three times with the\r\ncultivator while the plants are young, and afterwards kept clear of weeds\r\nwith the hoe. The weeds require but little attention after the plant has\r\nattained a fair growth. One tuber, or piece of tuber, of about the size\r\nof a hen’s egg, is sufficient for a hill, the seed being covered to the\r\ndepth of two or three inches with earth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the season is far enough advanced, one-sixth of the plot\r\n(one-eighth of an acre) should be planted in sweet corn. One half of the\r\ncorn should be set out very early, and the rest about four weeks later,\r\nso as to extend its growth, and consequently its availability as green\r\nfodder, over a longer period. The furrows should be three feet apart, and\r\nthe corn planted in drills, [sixteen to twenty kernels to the foot—ED.]\r\nAfterwards the corn should be cultivated two or three times, and kept\r\nclear of weeds. When the corn fodder is all disposed of, the corn patch\r\nshould be plowed, and seeded with about a peck of rye, and a pint of\r\ntimothy seed, and in the following spring a quart of clover seed should\r\nbe sown upon the rye. These crops will give the land a complete rotation\r\nevery six years. The following diagram indicates the proper succession\r\nof the crops and shows the plot of land divided into six equal parts,\r\ncontaining one-eighth of an acre each:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nClover occupies two parts, rye one part, and Jerusalem Artichokes two\r\nparts every year. Clover follows rye; rye follows corn; corn follows\r\nartichokes; and artichokes follow clover. Every year one-half of the\r\nclover, namely, the two-year-old clover patch, is plowed, and planted in\r\nartichokes. The latter must be planted anew, and not be allowed to grow\r\nas a “volunteer crop,” but must be regularly cultivated, and all the\r\nplants that come up between the hills destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe manure derived from the cow during the winter, should be spread in\r\nspring on the land intended for corn and artichokes, and plowed down,\r\nand that made in summer should be applied to the rye and clover patches\r\nin fall. Ashes and a moderate quantity of lime, spread on the clover\r\npatch early in spring, will be beneficial, and a peck of gypsum scattered\r\non the young and growing clover, will answer an excellent purpose as a\r\nhealthy stimulant of its growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—SWISS COW “GENEVA.”]\r\n\r\nThe spring time of the first year must be tided over with hay until the\r\nclover is large enough for soiling. Green clover is then fed to the cow\r\nuntil the oats are sufficiently advanced. The oats are then used as long\r\nas they are fit for the purpose, cutting them a second time as far as\r\npracticable, and the residue, if any, is cured for hay before it gets too\r\nripe for that purpose. The same course is pursued with the rye in the\r\nfollowing years. The clover should be cut for hay rather early, in order\r\nto get it in the best possible condition, and to insure a good second,\r\nand perhaps a third crop. All the aftermath not used in soiling, should\r\nbe converted into hay. When the oats are exhausted, clover is fed until\r\nthe corn fodder is large enough for use. This is fed until the ears make\r\ntheir appearance, and what is then left is cut and cured for dry fodder\r\nduring winter. After the green corn fodder is all consumed, there will be\r\na growth of new clover in the oats stubble the first year, and in the rye\r\nstubble in after years, with which the cow is soiled until the artichokes\r\nare ready to feed, and if any of the new clover is left by that time, it\r\nis made into hay. The artichokes are fed raw; in winter, with hay and\r\nother dry fodder, and as long as they last in spring.\r\n\r\nIn the second year soiling begins with rye, and continues afterwards\r\nthrough the season the same as the first year, and a like course is\r\nfollowed in succeeding years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\nThe artichokes will grow until frost kills the stalks, and a patch of\r\none-quarter of an acre, when the soil is in good condition, will yield a\r\nyearly average of between two hundred and fifty and three hundred bushels\r\nof them. They can be fed before they are quite ripe, in which case the\r\ncow will eat up the whole plant—root, stalk, and branch. She must not\r\nhave access to a heap of the tubers, lest she surfeit and seriously\r\ninjure herself. As long as the whole plant is fed, she should not be\r\nallowed more at a time than she will eat up clean, for if she gets more\r\nshe will eat the tubers, and refuse the stalks. In fact she will prefer\r\nthese tubers at all times to any other food. She should therefore receive\r\na certain allowance, say a peck or a little more, three times a day, so\r\nthat she will eat up the stalks, and also a small portion of other forage\r\nwith them. In winter and spring she will consume a bushel or more of the\r\nraw tubers a day, together with eight or ten pounds of hay or other dry\r\nfood. Her ration of artichokes should never be so large that she will\r\nreject other food.\r\n\r\nArtichokes can be fed for about eight months of the year, say from the\r\nfirst of October to the first of June, during which time the cow will\r\nconsume two hundred and forty bushels, or more, of them. These, with\r\nthe hay and other dry fodder, will keep her in excellent condition, and\r\nproduce an abundance of good milk without additional food. One ton of\r\nhay or other dry fodder, in connection with the artichokes, will last\r\nduring the said eight months, affording the cow eight or nine pounds a\r\nday. Three quarters of a ton may suffice, but she should not have less\r\nthan this. If the crop of hay and other dry fodder exceeds a ton, it may\r\nall be fed during the first year, or a part of it may be kept over for\r\nthe ensuing year. In stowing away the hay, ten or twelve quarts of salt\r\nshould be scattered through a ton of it, to impart a relish. In addition\r\nto this, the cow should receive two or three ounces of salt daily, and\r\nplenty of pure fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\nThe artichokes should remain in the ground in autumn as long as the\r\nweather permits, and be fed out of the field during that time, and just\r\nbefore the earth is permanently frost-bound, enough of them should be\r\ndug up to last over winter; and, since frost does not injure them, the\r\nrest should be left in the ground until the following spring. A good way\r\nto keep them in winter, is to place them on the ground in the field in\r\nshallow layers, covering them lightly with the stalks of the artichoke,\r\nor with straw, and then with a little earth. If the rain wets them it\r\nwill not injure them. It is advisable always to keep a considerable\r\nquantity of them in the stable or cellar for convenience of feeding. In\r\nthe ensuing spring, they are again fed out of the field until it is time\r\nto plow the land, when all the tubers not yet disposed of, are taken up\r\nand kept in the cellar or stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STALKS\r\n\r\nof the Jerusalem Artichoke furnish excellent material for litter for the\r\ncow. They grow to a hight of from eight to ten feet, are composed almost\r\nentirely of pith, and are so fragile that they can easily be broken into\r\nfragments. As many of them should be stowed in the stable as it will\r\ncontain, and the rest, if any, should be stacked outside. Before bedding\r\nthe cow with them, it is advisable to crush them with a mallet on a block\r\nprepared for the purpose. This labor will require but a few minutes daily\r\nto provide sufficient litter, and will make a comfortable bed for the\r\ncow, absorbing and retaining the liquid manure. The stalks cannot be used\r\nfor fodder after being frost-killed.\r\n\r\nIf the food of the cow should at any time run short the deficiency must\r\nbe supplied, for it will not do to stint her, and if it is ever found\r\nnecessary to change or modify her diet, it should be done.\r\n\r\nI have allowed three-quarters of an acre for the sustenance of the cow,\r\nand this will be sufficient, but only on condition that the land is in\r\ngood heart. If the land is poor at the start, it will be safer to begin\r\nwith more, and afterwards to reduce the quantity to three-quarters of\r\nan acre, as the soil increases in fertility. The value of clover as a\r\nrenovator of the soil is well known, but the Jerusalem Artichoke is\r\nequally efficacious, if fed on the farm, for it attracts its nitrogen to\r\na great extent from the atmosphere. The dairy-farm now under discussion\r\npossesses all the advantages that can be derived from these plants as\r\nfertilizers, and as the other crops raised on it do not injuriously\r\nexhaust the soil, being cut before they produce their seed, the land will\r\nimprove indefinitely in fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALF AND THE CARE OF IT.\r\n\r\nSince the plants here recommended for the nourishment of the cow, afford\r\nthe best milk-producing food the whole year round, the time of calving\r\nmay be left to the option of the owner, for it will not affect the\r\nquantity of milk that the cow gives. If the milk is mostly needed in\r\nsummer, the cow should calve in spring, and if it be desirable to have\r\nmore milk in winter, she should calve in autumn. I might add, that if the\r\nbutter, or a part of it, is to be sold, it will be more profitable to\r\nhave the calf in fall than in any other season, because butter brings the\r\nhighest prices in winter.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of the calf depends on circumstances, of which the owner is\r\nthe best judge. If he concludes to keep it on account of the value of the\r\nbreed, or for any other reason, he should raise it by hand, not allowing\r\nit to suck more than three days at furthest. For the first few days it\r\nshould receive only the fresh milk of the cow; afterwards it may be fed\r\non warm fresh milk, skim-milk, buttermilk, whey, and hay-tea, until it\r\nis old enough to subsist on solid food. Fresh milk should be the leading\r\ndiet in the beginning, and should be gradually diminished in quantity as\r\nthe calf increases in strength. Hay-tea is made by pouring boiling water\r\non hay, and letting it steep for about two hours. If the calf is not to\r\nbe raised, it ought to be sold before it is a week old, because the milk\r\nthat it drinks before it is ready for the shambles, is worth more than\r\nthe price it will bring. If a purchaser for the calf cannot be found\r\nwhile it is so young, it is most profitable to kill it, and bury it in\r\nthe compost heap, as soon as the milk of the cow is fit to use. I simply\r\nstate this as a fact, without recommending it to be done, for it is cruel\r\nwork; but so is any butchering, and if the calf is to be killed, it\r\nreally matters not how soon it is done. The sooner it is removed from the\r\ncow the less she will grieve for its loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVING.\r\n\r\nThe cow should be milked as long as her milk is good, or until she runs\r\ndry, which may in some cases be six or eight weeks of calving (in others\r\nnot at all.) Her rations should be curtailed a little for a short time\r\nbefore that period, in order to carry her safely through the crisis.\r\nAfter she has the calf, she may receive warm bran-mashes for a day or\r\ntwo, containing a little of her own milk, and should not be fully fed for\r\nthe first few days. This treatment is all that is required before and\r\nafter the period of calving. The cow will generally pass through this\r\nevent in safety, without assistance. Should there, however, be a false\r\npresentation, or other difficulty of parturition, the best thing the\r\nowner can do, if he has no experience in the matter, is to call to his\r\naid a veterinary surgeon, or a neighbor who knows what course to pursue\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nAs long as the cow is fresh, and yields a large flow of milk, she should\r\nbe milked three times a day, early in the morning, at noon, and late\r\nin the evening; afterwards two milkings daily, will be sufficient. She\r\nshould be fed, watered, milked, carded, and led out of and into the\r\nstable, at the same hours every day. She should not be beaten, or pelted,\r\nor harshly spoken to or dealt with in any manner. Kind and considerate\r\ntreatment inspires her with confidence and contentment, makes her the\r\npet and delight of the household, and is rewarded by an abundance of\r\nwholesome milk. But there are many matters of detail in keeping a cow,\r\nwhich it is impossible to notice in a limited essay like this. If the\r\nowner desires to be fully informed on the subject, he will do well to\r\npurchase a few books that treat upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe stable for the cow should be warm, dry, well ventilated, and large\r\nenough to contain two or three tons of hay and litter, together with\r\nother material to be described hereafter, besides a stall for the cow,\r\nand room for the calf. If the owner of the cow has a stable that fulfils\r\nthese requirements, it will answer his purpose if he makes a proper stall\r\nin it. If he has no stable, and cannot afford the expense of building a\r\ngood one, he must at least have a proper stall to save the manure of the\r\ncow, and to shelter her from the inclemency of the weather. A stable that\r\nwill fully answer this purpose, should be at least fourteen feet square,\r\nand about twelve feet high to the eaves, and should have a loft for\r\nstoring hay. The annexed figures represent such a structure in outline:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nFigure 17 is a ground plan, and shows that the lower story is divided\r\ninto two parts, _S_, representing the stall, and _R_, all the remaining\r\nportion below. The stall is ten feet long, and should be five, or nearly\r\nfive feet wide; _M_, represents the manger, which is about two feet deep,\r\neighteen inches wide, and in length equal to the width of the stall. The\r\ncow is tied to the manger with a halter or chain; _T_, is a trough in the\r\nmanger for feeding roots, salt, etc., and is about one foot wide, eight\r\ninches deep, and in length equal to the width of the manger. The floor\r\nof the stall should slope a little to the rear, and must be water-tight,\r\nso as to conduct the urine of the cow into the brine-pit, _B_. The floor\r\nmay be composed of cement, or of two-inch plank closely fitted together.\r\nThe brine-pit, _B_, consists of a water-tight box made of plank, and\r\nshould be about one foot wide, six inches deep, and in length equal to\r\nthe width of the stall. This pit is sunk into the ground so that its top\r\nis on a level with the floor, in order that it may receive all the liquid\r\ndischarges of the cow that are not absorbed by the litter. If the floor\r\nis laid in cement the pit may be made of the same material. The object\r\nof the brine-pit is to save the liquid manure; to accomplish which the\r\nlatter must be retained by some absorbent. Dry earth is used for this\r\npurpose. At first the bottom of the pit is covered with dry earth, and\r\nas soon as this is moist, more earth is added until the pit is full of\r\nthe saturated substance, when the latter is thrown upon the compost heap,\r\nand the same process repeated. A door is placed at _e_, for admitting the\r\ncow, and carrying away the manure. The partition between _S_ and _R_ may\r\nbe made of boards or rails, and need not be over four feet high.\r\n\r\nThe division, _R_, is used for keeping litter, dry earth, artichoke\r\nroots, green fodder, and the calf. It should have a door at some\r\nconvenient place for entrance from the outside, and a window with a\r\nglass-frame, preferably on the south side. It is in communication with\r\nthe stall by means of a gate at _d_.\r\n\r\nFigure 18 is a view of the gable-end, _L_, representing the loft for\r\nstoring hay and other dry fodder. The loft has a shutter in one of the\r\ngable-ends or sides, and a ladder or steps running up to it from within,\r\nfor convenience of feeding. _P_, is a post in the corner of the manger.\r\nThe other letters in figure 18 indicate the same parts as in figure 17.\r\n\r\nThe cow-yard will be large enough if it contains an area of two square\r\nrods; but it can be made somewhat larger with advantage. It ought to\r\nadjoin the stable so as to give the cow direct access to the stall; and\r\nought to be shaded by trees in order to afford shelter to the cow from\r\nthe direct rays of the sun in summer. The cow should be kept in the\r\nyard only a part of the day, and the rest of the time she should be in\r\nthe stall. The stall-door should be left open when she is in the yard,\r\nso that she can enter the stable at will. Some manure will be lost by\r\nsuffering her to run in the yard; but the benefit that she will derive\r\nfrom it, in health and contentment, will more than compensate for the\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING AND SAVING MANURE.\r\n\r\nThe compost heap may be kept in the cow-yard, and must be in the shade.\r\nIt should, therefore, be placed on the north side of the stable, and\r\ntrees should be planted east and west of it. It must not be under cover\r\nnor washed by running water, nor receive the water from the roof of the\r\nstable; but the rain should fall on it directly from the skies to promote\r\ndecomposition, and to prevent the escape of its volatile constituents.\r\nThe manure of the stall, and the saturated earth of the brine pit, are\r\nmixed together to form the compost heap, and all the refuse material of\r\nthe farm, garden, and yard, should be thrown on it. It ought to be kept\r\nin a compact body, level on top, and protected by boards on the sides to\r\nprevent it from spreading. No ashes or lime should ever be applied to it.\r\n\r\nRegarding the material for absorbing the liquid excretions of the cow,\r\nnothing better can be found than prepared muck; but as this is seldom\r\nobtainable, the scrapings of the streets of a city, or even of a public\r\nroad, may be used instead. If these cannot be had, the surface soil of\r\nthe dairy farm answer the purpose. Whatever substance is employed must be\r\nthoroughly dried. The middle of summer is the proper time to prepare it.\r\nAbout four cart loads of it, as dry as they can be made, should be kept\r\nin the stable, or in some other place where it is not liable to attract\r\nmoisture; and that amount will last the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS ABOUT ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\nI have now given my instructions for keeping a cow, and it is evident\r\nfrom what I have written, that the Jerusalem Artichoke is my main\r\ndependence for her support. The other points that I have touched upon,\r\nare of minor importance, when compared with the value that I have\r\nattached to this plant. My own experience with the plant satisfies me\r\nthat I have not overstated its merits. On rich land a single stalk will\r\nproduce from a peck to half a bushel of the tubers. Last year was an\r\nexceptionably unfavorable one in this locality, on account of drouth in\r\nsummer and fall; and yet the artichokes that I planted between the trees\r\nin my peach orchard yielded abundantly. I have fattened cattle on them\r\nwithout any additional food excepting a little hay, until they were fit\r\nfor the butcher; and my horses thrive on them when fed in connection with\r\nhay, doing full work without grain. A brother of mine planted artichokes\r\nin a field that had been in cultivation for more than a century, and yet\r\nin spite of the drouth, of indifferent culture without manure, and of an\r\nearly frost that prematurely killed the plants, the yield amounted to\r\nbetween five hundred and six hundred bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nBoussingault in his “Rural Economy,” pp. 159-160 says: “The Jerusalem\r\nArtichoke rises to a hight of from nine to ten feet; it flowers late,\r\nand I have not yet seen it ripen its seeds. It is propagated by the\r\ntubers which it produces, and which are regarded, for good reason, a\r\nmost excellent food for cattle.... There are few plants more hardy and\r\nso little nice about the soil as the Jerusalem Artichoke; it succeeds\r\neverywhere with the single condition that the ground be not wet.... Of\r\nall the plants that engage the husbandman, the Jerusalem Artichoke is\r\nthat which produces the most at the least expense of manure and manual\r\nlabor. Kade states that a square patch of Jerusalem Artichokes in a\r\ngarden was still in full productive vigor at the end of thirty-three\r\nyears, throwing out stems from seven to ten feet in length, although for\r\na very long time the plant had neither received any care or any manure.\r\nI could quote many examples of the great reproductive power of the\r\nHelianthus; I can affirm, nevertheless, that in order to obtain abundant\r\ncrops, it is necessary to afford a little manure.... Schwertz estimates\r\nthe mean quantity of dry leaves and stems at three tons, one cwt., one\r\nquarter and fifteen pounds per acre.”\r\n\r\nAgain, p. 401—“Experiment with horses.—Jerusalem potatoes are held\r\nexcellent food for the horse; they are eaten greedily, and he thrives\r\non them. In this second experiment 30.8 pounds of Jerusalems cut into\r\nslices were substituted for eleven pounds of hay, the same theoretical\r\nequivalents being assumed for them as for the common potato. The ration\r\nnow consisted of hay, eleven pounds; straw, five and a half pounds; oats,\r\nseven and a half pounds, and Jerusalem potatoes, 30.8 pounds. Having been\r\naccustomed to this regimen for some days, the teams were weighed, and\r\nhaving gone on for eleven days, they were weighed again:\r\n\r\n                _Team No. 1._  _No. 2._  _Both Teams._  _Mean per horse._\r\n    In eleven days, gain 55    loss 33     gain 22        gain .9\r\n\r\n“A result which leads to the conclusion that the equivalent assumed for\r\nthe Jerusalem potato was correct; the animals had done their work, and\r\ngained one with another nine-tenths of a pound in weight.”\r\n\r\nAgain, p. 406.—“One hundred pounds of good meadow-hay may be taken, as\r\nascertained by experiment, to be equivalent to\r\n\r\n    280 of Potatoes,      by analysis equal to 315\r\n    280 of Jerusalems,          ”       ”      311\r\n    400 of Beets,               ”       ”      548\r\n    400 of Swedes (too little), ”       ”      676\r\n    400 of Carrots,             ”       ”      382\r\n\r\nAgain, p. 415.—“One thousand parts (by weight) of the forage gathered at\r\nBechelbroun in its ordinary state contained:\r\n\r\n                  _Mineral     _Azote._  _Phos.   _Lime._  _Bone\r\n                 Substances._             Acid._            Earth._\r\n    Potatoes,       9.64         3.70     1.09      .17      .33\r\n    Beet,           7.70         2.10      .46      .54      .95\r\n    Turnip,         5.70         1.30      .35      .62      .72\r\n    Jerusalems,    12.47         3.75     1.35      .29      .53\r\n\r\nAgain, p. 449.—“Seventh experiment—with a cow two hundred and ninety\r\ndays after calving.—In this trial the ration consisted of Jerusalem\r\npotatoes equivalent to thirty-three pounds of hay, under which the milk\r\nmay be said to have remained stationary, though it was above rather than\r\nunder the six pints per diem, as in the sixth experiment,” (with Irish\r\npotatoes).\r\n\r\nI consider, therefore, that, according to experiment and analysis, the\r\nJerusalem Artichoke is fully equal to the potato as food for stock, and\r\ngreatly superior to beets, turnips, and carrots. In the regimen that I\r\nhave prescribed for the cow, I have given the Jerusalem Artichoke the\r\npreference over all other roots, because I deem it superior to them in\r\nall respects. It contains more nutriment than any of them, excepting\r\nthe potato; it is less exhaustive of the soil, and more efficacious in\r\nimproving it; it produces a larger crop; it is less liable to failure in\r\nadverse weather; it keeps better and with less care; it is eaten with\r\na greater relish by stock; and it requires less labor in cultivating,\r\nharvesting, and feeding it. Analysis has shown that it contains its\r\ncarbonaceous principles in the form of sugar instead of starch, 14.8\r\nparts of uncrystallizable sugar having been found in one hundred parts of\r\nthe tuber. It has no starch cells to be broken up by boiling, in order\r\nto make it a digestible aliment; and how large soever the tubers may\r\nbe, they can be fed without being cut into slices, on account of their\r\nfragility and brittleness, being masticated by the cow without difficulty\r\nor danger of choking.\r\n\r\nThe Jerusalem Artichoke is little known and cultivated in this country,\r\nand its merits are not fully appreciated anywhere. The reason probably\r\nis because there is but a limited demand for it in the market. But it\r\nshould not be neglected on that account; for it is not the less valuable,\r\nbecause the profits derived from it are indirect. It should never be\r\nraised as a volunteer crop, as is too often the case, but should be\r\nregularly planted and worked like other products. I have discussed this\r\nplant as advantageous food for “one” cow, and I may add that it is\r\nequally meritorious for any number of cows. But its advantages do not\r\nstop here. Horses, cattle, sheep, and swine, thrive and fatten on it, and\r\nthe millions of acres of exhausted and deteriorated lands, that descend\r\nas a profitless inheritance from generation to generation in the Eastern\r\nand Southern States, can be improved and kept fertile, with profit to the\r\nfarmer during the process of renovation, without the aid of artificial\r\nfertilizers or imported manures, by feeding the tubers of the Jerusalem\r\nArtichoke to stock on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS AND PRACTICE OF A PRACTICAL FARMER.\r\n\r\nBY F. E. GOTT, SPENCERPORT, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been a practical farmer all my life, with considerable experience\r\nin the care of stock and dairying, I give you the result of my\r\nexperience. The system of management which would be profitably adopted\r\nby one would be utterly impracticable for another. In my own case I have\r\nabout one acre of land, one half of which I set apart for production of\r\nfood for my cow, while the remainder is occupied by the buildings in\r\npart, and the rest is devoted to the culture of small fruits. Without\r\nthis land I should be obliged to hire my cow pastured through the summer,\r\nat a cost of about fifty cents per week, which I am now able to save by\r\npractising a system of soiling. The advantages of which are numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFIT IN BUYING PART OF THE FEED.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the amount of land which I have devoted to this purpose\r\nis inadequate. One acre would be none too much to supply a cow with food\r\nthrough the year, but I can realize more profit by purchasing a portion\r\nof the necessary food and devoting part of my land to the culture of\r\nsmall fruits, the amount of money received from the sales of which, will\r\nmore than pay for the feed that I could raise on the same land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—PLAN OF COW-SHED, ETC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—PERSPECTIVE VIEW.]\r\n\r\nMy barn (figs. 19 and 20) is inexpensive, yet it answers every purpose.\r\nIt consists of a box-pen for the cow, an open shed and a pig-sty, the\r\nwhole covered by one roof, and occupying a space twenty feet in length\r\nby fourteen feet in breadth. It is constructed of hemlock lumber. The\r\nposts on the front are twelve feet in hight, while those on the back side\r\nare eight. It is boarded vertically and battened on the sides, and the\r\nroof is also covered with rough boards, laid on double, breaking joints\r\nso that no water can leak through. The box for the cow is eight feet by\r\nten, and is six feet and four inches high in the clear. Adjoining this\r\nis a feeding passage four feet by eight. The arrangement of doors is\r\nshown in the accompanying sketch. The middle portion of the building is\r\nan open shed, and is seven feet wide by fourteen feet long. It is used\r\nprincipally for storing dry muck and also as a cover for the manure pile.\r\nAdjoining the open shed is the pig-pen. While the partition between the\r\ncow-stall and shed is carried up to the floor above, making a tight box\r\nstall, that between the pig-sty and shed is only built four feet from\r\nthe ground, leaving the upper part open. A floor is laid at a hight of\r\nsix feet ten inches from the ground, which provides storage room for hay\r\nabove. I would suggest, as an improvement to this plan, that the whole\r\nbe built two feet higher, making the long posts fourteen feet instead of\r\ntwelve, and the short ones ten instead of eight, thereby securing more\r\nroom above. There would then be sufficient room for the storage of over\r\ntwo thousand pounds of clover hay. Of course the provision I have made\r\nfor a pig is outside of the question under consideration, but in view of\r\nthe fact that wherever a cow is kept, a pig may also be profitably raised\r\nand fattened on the skim-milk and much that would otherwise be wasted,\r\nand at the same time increase greatly the value of the manure heap, I\r\nthink such provision should be made, especially as the cost of such an\r\naddition to the cow’s shed is but little. In case it is not desirable to\r\nkeep a pig, the space may be used as a calf-pen or for the storage of\r\nstraw. The cost of the building which I have described should not exceed\r\nfifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe only way to secure a good cow, is to keep trying until we get such\r\na cow as we want and then hold on to her. We may have to change several\r\ntimes before we can bring this about, but there is no infallible rule for\r\nselecting a good cow. Were I to select one for myself, I should select\r\none not over five years old, of gentle, quiet disposition, with a large\r\nbarrel; one whose udder is large and well formed, with teats set well\r\napart, of good size, and projecting slightly outward from each other, and\r\nwith large milk veins.\r\n\r\nThe method which I have adopted in the management of my cow, has this in\r\nits favor, that it has been highly and uniformly profitable to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGING THE MANURE PILE.\r\n\r\nI shall first present my mode of making manure, and of applying the same.\r\nThe prevalent idea among those who keep a single cow or other domestic\r\nanimal is, that the manure, instead of being saved and protected from\r\nloss with the greatest care, is a nuisance, which should be summarily\r\ndisposed of. It is an established fact that the liquid portion of the\r\nexcrement nearly, if not quite, equals in value the solid portion, and\r\nin order to save both we must provide some means by which the liquid and\r\nvolatile portions of the manure may be prevented from going to waste.\r\nThis is best accomplished by means of absorbents, and there is nothing\r\nbetter or cheaper for this purpose than dried muck or earth, a good\r\nsupply of which should be constantly kept under cover where it is easily\r\naccessible. Fortunately I am so situated that I can obtain a supply quite\r\neasily. There is within half a mile from my place a large tract of swamp\r\nland, from which I can obtain, for a low price, all the “muck” I need.\r\nEvery fall, I store away under my shed a sufficient quantity to last me\r\nthrough the winter. This had previously been thrown into piles and dried.\r\nIt is quite essential that it should be thoroughly dried, so that it\r\nwill readily absorb the liquid manure, and this may be accomplished by\r\npiling and allowing it to be exposed to sun and air for six months or a\r\nyear before wanted for use. The bottom of the stall is covered with ten\r\nor twelve inches of the dry muck, over which I scatter a light covering\r\nof cut straw or sawdust, so as to secure a clean bed, and prevent the\r\nparticles of dirt and muck from sticking to the cow and dropping from\r\nthence into the pail. The dry earth readily absorbs the liquid droppings\r\nand whenever it becomes saturated with the same, may be removed, together\r\nwith the manure and soiled straw, to a pile beneath the covered shed,\r\nwhen a fresh supply of dry muck, enough to replace that which was removed\r\nis carried in and the whole is again covered with the cut straw. An\r\noccasional sprinkling of plaster (gypsum) is applied both to the litter\r\nin the stall and to the manure heap, which prevents any loss of ammonia,\r\nand hence all unpleasant odors are avoided. Whenever a forkful of manure\r\nis put on the pile, it is immediately covered with muck. Twice each year\r\nthis is hauled on to the land. Manure thus treated will not waste, either\r\nby the leaching out of soluble matter, by the escape of ammonia, or by\r\nfire-fanging. And as there is no coarse material, such as long straw or\r\ncorn stalks mingled with it, it is always in a suitable condition to\r\nuse. If dry earth or muck cannot be obtained, cut straw or sawdust may\r\nbe substituted. But earth, being an excellent deodorizer itself, and\r\ncontaining, as it does, much valuable fertilizing matter, is much to be\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nIf artificial fertilizers are used, they may at any time be mixed with\r\nthe compost heap. Also, when a pig is kept, its pen should be cleaned\r\ndaily and the litter, mingled with the general pile, will add greatly\r\nto its value. Common salt may occasionally be added to the compost heap\r\nwith advantage, but ashes never, as they tend to liberate the ammonia and\r\nthereby cause waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARD ROOM AND EXERCISE.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have a large yard connected with the stable, as\r\na cow is seldom inclined to exercise her locomotive powers more than\r\nis required to secure her food, and if this is placed before her at\r\nsuitable times and in sufficient quantity to supply her demands, she\r\nwill remain perfectly contented in an enclosure twenty feet square. In\r\nplanning our buildings let us bear in mind that sunlight is essential\r\nto perfect health. Therefore we should have the yard on the sunny side\r\nof the building. At the same time we should see that there is a shady\r\ncorner, where the cow may take herself during intense heat. A hint in\r\nthis direction is sufficient. Nothing can be more cruel than to force\r\nany dumb animal to stand exposed to the rays of an August mid-day sun, or\r\nwhere she is tormented nearly to death by flies. Yet we often see just\r\nsuch inhuman neglect on the part of those who should know better.\r\n\r\nAlthough in many respects desirable, a pasture lot is not absolutely\r\nessential, and in the case of the villager, whose land is measured by\r\nfeet instead of acres, it must be dispensed with. Hence we have recourse\r\nto what is termed the soiling system, which is simply cultivating such\r\ncrops as will produce a succession of green food throughout the season,\r\nand placing the same before the cow in such quantities and at such times\r\nas she may require, instead of allowing her to tramp around after her\r\nfeed, and thereby waste more than she eats. It requires some skill and\r\njudgment to carry out this plan successfully, but wherever it has bean\r\npractised judiciously and intelligently, the results have been uniformly\r\nsatisfactory. As to what amount of land is required in order to keep\r\na cow through the year, I will not pretend to say; nor do I think it\r\nadvisable to try to produce the entire amount of food required for a full\r\nyear’s sustenance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY.\r\n\r\nI know that for me it is far better to purchase what hay will be needed\r\nto feed through the winter than to attempt to grow it. Besides, our\r\nvillage lots are much too small to be profitably converted into hay\r\nfields, and even if there should be more land than is necessary to\r\nfurnish the soiling crops for summer feeding, it is usually much better\r\neconomy to employ the same in the cultivation of small fruits, which, as\r\nI have before stated, more than pays for what hay is required, besides\r\nsupplying us with many luxuries.\r\n\r\nIn my own case, I have set apart one-half of an acre from which to supply\r\nthe cow with food during a period extending from May first to November\r\nfirst. Now this will be entirely insufficient, except under the very\r\nbest cultivation and management, which, of course, I am bound to bestow\r\nupon it. That it is sufficient, with proper care, I have repeatedly\r\nproved. Such results could hardly be expected, however, from land which\r\nhas received no previous preparation, and is worn, wormy, and weedy.\r\nLet us assume, then, that our half acre is in a good, fair state of\r\nproductiveness. To produce a continuous supply of wholesome fodder, I\r\nfind a system of rotation must be practised, and have subdivided my half\r\nacre into four equal parts, containing each one-eighth of an acre, or\r\ntwenty square rods. These I shall designate as plots one, two, three,\r\nand four. Plot one is at the present time in clover, having been seeded\r\none year ago, and will be ready for use about June. Plot two was sown\r\nto winter rye last October, and will be seeded down with clover this\r\nspring. From this patch of rye I shall obtain the earliest feed, and\r\nwill begin using it about May first. Plot three will be sown with corn,\r\ndrilled thickly in rows two and a half feet apart, which, if sown as soon\r\nas danger from frost is past, will be ready for use about August first.\r\nPlot four will be sown to mangels or sugar beets. I prefer the latter,\r\nand this is the only crop cultivated for winter use. Both this crop and\r\nthe corn are planted with a garden seed drill, while the rye is sown\r\nbroadcast. On the first of May I begin cutting the rye. Up to this time\r\nthe cow has been fed on clover, hay, and grain.\r\n\r\nI calculate to have the cow drop her calf at about April first. To this\r\nend I have her served about June twenty-fifth. Of course, we cannot\r\nalways have our own way in this matter, but, accident excepted, we can\r\nusually manage so as to approximate the time. During a period of a few\r\ndays subsequent to parturition, I feed quite sparingly—however, allowing\r\nher all the long hay she will eat, together with a peck of beets twice\r\na day, but no grain of any kind, this reduced ration being necessary to\r\navoid the danger which might result from the too abundant secretion of\r\nmilk at this time, which high feeding would tend to produce. If at the\r\nend of the fifth day after calving, no bad results have occurred, such\r\nas milk fever, and there is little or no caking of the bag, I begin to\r\ngradually increase the feed, until, at the tenth day, I reach the normal\r\nstandard, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDAILY FEEDING.\r\n\r\nAt half-past five A. M. I feed her four quarts of a mixture consisting\r\nof one part each of corn meal and oat meal, and two parts of bran. Four\r\nquarts of this is mixed with a heaping half bushel of cut (chaffed) hay,\r\nmoistened but not soaked. While she is occupied in eating, I clean the\r\nmanure from the stable, remove all dirt from her udder, and any that\r\nwould be likely to drop into the pail while milking. Sometimes a sponge\r\nand water are required to accomplish this, but usually an old piece of\r\na blanket kept for the purpose is all that is necessary. I then milk\r\nand carry the milk directly to the house before it has time to cool or\r\nabsorb odors, which, even with the utmost care and cleanliness cannot\r\nbe entirely avoided. After breakfast, I give the cow a peck of sliced\r\nbeets, on which has been sprinkled about a dessert spoonful of salt,\r\nwhich completes her breakfast. At this time it is a very good plan to use\r\nthe curry comb or card for ten or fifteen minutes, though I must confess\r\nthat I sometimes neglect this part of the programme: still I think that\r\nmy cow gets far more indulgence in this direction than most cows in the\r\nneighborhood. After she has finished eating, if the weather is not too\r\nunfavorable, I allow her to run out in the yard, where, at noon, I give\r\nher just as much long hay as she will eat up clean, and no more.\r\n\r\nThere is at all times plenty of fresh water in the yard, to which she\r\ncan help herself whenever she so desires; otherwise she would need\r\nto have it supplied to her at least twice a day, but not immediately\r\nbefore or after a feed of grain. At half-past five in the afternoon\r\nshe receives the same amount of food, and prepared in the same manner\r\nas in the morning. This method is continued until the crop of rye is\r\nlarge enough for use. All changes from dry to green feed must be made\r\ngradually, if we would avoid loss. By this time our supply of roots will\r\nbe exhausted, but the green food, in a measure, takes the place of them.\r\nI continue to give the same amount of grain throughout the summer as\r\nI did through the month of April, and also to mix it with chaffed hay\r\nslightly moistened, as this insures the complete mastication and thorough\r\nintermingling with the saliva, which is so essential to perfect digestion\r\nand assimilation. As the supply of green food increases, I diminish the\r\nquantity of chaffed hay until but one-half the former amount is used,\r\nwhich quantity is continued through the soiling season. The one-eighth\r\nacre of rye will last until about June fifteenth, at which time the red\r\nclover will be large enough to feed. We should not change abruptly from\r\none kind of green food to another, but increase the one and diminish the\r\nother gradually until the change is complete. To ascertain the exact\r\namount needed for a feed of this kind, as well as of the other green\r\ncrops, requires some judgment on the part of the feeder; but a very safe\r\nrule is to feed just such an amount as the cow will eat clean, and no\r\nmore. We cannot specify exactly what would be a proper amount in every\r\ncase, neither can we spend time to weigh each ration, but, by observing\r\ncarefully, we are enabled to determine very closely. I find that my cow\r\nwill eat, besides her other feed, a good armful of green fodder three\r\ntimes a day. I always cut a day’s supply on the afternoon preceding, and\r\nallow it to remain in the swath, where it will wilt, and a portion of\r\nthe water evaporate, thereby rendering it more wholesome than when fed\r\nimmediately after cutting, and I think my cow relishes it better. By the\r\nfifteenth or twentieth of July the clover will have become so ripe as\r\nto necessitate the cutting and curing of any that may be left at that\r\ntime. It may still be fed, however, for a few days, or until the sowed\r\ncorn becomes large enough to take its place, which is generally about the\r\nfirst of August. This crop, and the second cutting of the clover, will\r\ncomplete the course, and will furnish feed until well along into October,\r\nor the first of November, after which I depend on purchased food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—THE DUTCH (HOLSTEIN) COW “CROWN PRINCESS.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER FEED AND TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIf not previously done, I now procure three thousand pounds of the best\r\nearly cut clover hay. As my shed is not sufficiently large to store\r\naway this amount, I am obliged to stack part of it. I also procure bran\r\nand meal. The amount of these which I require for a year’s supply is:\r\nof bran, one thousand pounds; of corn meal, one thousand pounds; and\r\nof oat meal, seven hundred and fifty pounds. These amounts, well mixed\r\ntogether, will furnish a feed of eight quarts per day, which amount is\r\ndiminished during the period in which the cow is dry, and is sometimes\r\nincreased, if by any means other food is short. It is not advisable\r\nto procure all this feed at once, for, if stored, it would be quite\r\nlikely to heat and mould before it could be used, besides being subject\r\nto loss from rats and other vermin. I therefore procure one-sixth of\r\nthis amount, or two months’ supply at a time, and I have often found it\r\nconvenient and profitable to buy the corn and oats and have them ground\r\nmyself. The course pursued in feeding from November first until February\r\nfifteenth, at which time the cow becomes dry, is similar to that which I\r\nhave described for the month of April. It is better to dry off the cow\r\nfour, five, or even six weeks prior to calving. Sometimes, in order to do\r\nthis, it will be necessary to omit the grain and diminish the quantity of\r\nroots for a few days, but after she becomes quite dry I resume feeding as\r\nbefore, except perhaps to lessen the amount of grain until within a few\r\ndays of calving, when I omit the grain entirely until, as I have before\r\nstated, the danger from milk fever, etc., is past.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVING.\r\n\r\nSome people continue to milk their cows until within a very short time\r\nof calving. This is very poor economy. The milk at such times is thin\r\nand insipid, and unfit for food. I have never found any “preparatory\r\ntreatment” of the cow prior to parturition, such as physicing,\r\netc., to be necessary; but place her on short rations for a few\r\ndays—administering, as one writer terms it, “judicious starvation.” The\r\nfeed of roots is continued, as they exert a laxative effect on the bowels\r\nand tissues, thereby obviating the necessity of giving a huge dose of\r\nEpsom Salts. In an experience of fifteen years, by following this plan\r\nof restricting the diet, I have not had a case of milk fever, apoplexy,\r\nor retention of placenta, and but one case which called for assistance,\r\nand this was due wholly to an accident. When a single cow is kept, she\r\nis, of course, exempt from the ill consequences which so often result\r\nfrom crowding and fighting with other cows, and, if kindly treated and\r\nprovided with comfortable accommodations for feeding and shelter, she\r\nwill seldom have any trouble. But cases where assistance is indispensable\r\ndo sometimes occur, even under the best management, the most frequent\r\nof which is the retention of the placenta or after-birth. If, at the\r\nend of twenty-four hours, the cow has not “cleaned,” it is then time\r\nto undertake the removal of the placenta. This can be accomplished by\r\ncarefully introducing the right arm of a man having a small hand, which\r\nshould previously be well greased, into the cavity of the uterus, when\r\nthe connecting attachments will readily be found and may be separated,\r\nafter which the whole may be brought away. These attachments are often\r\nquite numerous, and care should be taken that all are detached, and that\r\nthe whole of the after-birth is removed, as serious results sometimes\r\noccur when a portion of it is retained.\r\n\r\nIf, from any cause, the fœtus has got into an unnatural position,\r\nor shows any other presentation than that of the two fore feet and\r\nmuzzle, natural labor may be rendered impossible, and assistance will\r\nbe required in order to set matters right. There are several abnormal\r\npositions in which the calf may be presented, while there are but two\r\npositions in which delivery is practicable. In the natural position the\r\ntwo fore feet and nose are the parts which make their first appearance.\r\nWhen this is the case we may generally conclude that our services\r\nwill not be required. If, on the other hand, there is any alteration\r\nof this position, either by the absence of the head or of one or both\r\nfeet, or if, when labor pains have continued for some time, there is\r\nno presentation at all, it will be necessary to investigate the cause.\r\nThe owner’s duty, in cases of this nature, will be to restore it, by\r\njudicious manipulation, to its normal position, or to such a position as\r\nwill render delivery practicable. If, from the nature of the case, the\r\nfore legs and nose of the fœtus cannot be brought into such a position,\r\nwe must endeavor to bring up the hind legs and deliver it in that\r\nposition. It frequently occurs in this position, as well as sometimes in\r\nthe natural one, that traction will have to be applied. In such cases\r\nit should be applied simultaneously with the throes of the cow. In rare\r\ncases it becomes necessary to amputate portions of the fœtus and bring\r\nthem away separately, which operation should be left to the veterinary\r\nsurgeon. In fact, whenever assistance is required, it is better to\r\nemploy the services of a competent surgeon, if such can be obtained. But\r\nwhere professional assistance cannot be obtained, it is much better to\r\nuse one’s own judgment than to depend on the village cow doctor, who is\r\nusually one of the most ignorant persons in the community. Happily, cases\r\nrequiring any assistance, where a single cow is kept, are rare.\r\n\r\nFor _Mamitis_ or garget I have given successfully the following powder\r\ntwice daily: Pulverized Digitalis, one drahm; Nitre, one ounce; Cream of\r\nTartar, one-half ounce; mix and give in the feed. If the bag is caked and\r\nhard, let the calf run with the cow for a few days.\r\n\r\nI do not consider it profitable to raise the calf, therefore I dispose of\r\nit as soon as possible. There are always plenty of farmers or farmers’\r\nboys who are glad to buy a good calf to raise, and will willingly pay one\r\nor two dollars for the same, and take it right away. I prefer to raise\r\nand fatten a pig instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS AND FAILURES.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than fair for me to say concerning my plan of feeding,\r\nthat I have occasionally been obliged to modify some of the details, on\r\naccount of unfavorable circumstances. For instance, I have been forced to\r\ncut grass from the highway in front of my house, to supply a deficiency\r\nin some crop, caused by unfavorable weather, or some accident or other.\r\nIn the spring of 1878, my clover failed to catch, leaving me to make\r\nup for the loss of that crop as well as I could. It was certainly most\r\nunfortunate, inasmuch as it seriously interfered with the whole system\r\nof rotation. To carry out the plan of soiling successfully requires\r\nconsiderable time and labor. And on the whole, unless one has plenty of\r\nthe former at his disposal, and a good wholesome inclination for the\r\nlatter, he could do full as well to adopt the old time practice of having\r\nhis cow pastured by the week, in which case no other labor than milking\r\nwould be required, while, if she were allowed a feed of meal or bran at\r\nthe time of milking, night and morning, very satisfactory results would\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE YEAR’S RESULTS.\r\n\r\nTo show what I have accomplished by it, I will give an account of the\r\nproducts of my cow “Polly,” for the year ending April first, 1880,\r\ntogether with a statement of the actual expenses of her keeping.\r\nBesides what was used in a family of four, I have sold one hundred and\r\nsixty-nine pounds of butter, at an average of twenty cents per pound,\r\nwhich amounts to thirty-three dollars and eighty cents; eight hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight quarts of milk, at six cents per quart, forty-nine dollars\r\nand sixty-eight cents; eighteen quarts of butter-milk, at three cents\r\nper quart, fifty-four cents; eleven quarts of sour milk, at two cents,\r\ntwenty-two cents; one calf, four days old, one dollar and seventy-five\r\ncents; total, eighty-five dollars and ninety-nine cents. To this I may\r\nadd one hundred and twenty pounds of butter consumed at home, twenty-four\r\ndollars, and about two hundred and thirty quarts of milk, worth thirteen\r\ndollars and eighty cents; making in all, one hundred and twenty-three\r\ndollars and seventy-nine cents. The cost of feed was as follows: One\r\nthousand pounds bran, nine dollars and sixty cents; one thousand pounds\r\ncorn meal, eleven dollars and fifty cents; seven hundred and fifty pounds\r\nof oatmeal, nine dollars and eighty five cents; three thousand pounds\r\nclover hay, thirteen dollars and fifty cents; two hundred pounds rye\r\nstraw, one dollar and fifty cents; muck, two dollars; total, forty-seven\r\ndollars and ninety-five cents; leaving a balance of seventy-five dollars\r\nand eighty-four cents. As I keep a horse, I have the necessary tools for\r\ncultivating the land myself, I have not added the cost of cultivation as\r\nan item in the expense column, and perhaps it may be said that I should\r\nalso have added interest on land and buildings. As an offset to these,\r\nI would call attention to the valuable pile of manure, and furthermore\r\nI have made no account of a large amount of skim-milk, on which I\r\nraised a pig. This pig was fed nothing but sour milk, and a very few\r\nsmall potatoes, until about four weeks prior to butchering, when he was\r\n“finished off” on corn meal. He weighed, after being dressed, December\r\ntwenty-eighth, two hundred and seventy-eight pounds. The profits from\r\nthis cow would undoubtedly have been larger had I sold all the milk,\r\ninstead of making butter out of a part of it, but I did not make mere\r\nprofit my sole object in the matter. I wished to supply my family with\r\nthose necessary luxuries which, I believe, are rendered even sweeter by\r\nthe consciousness of their being the products of our own labor. The\r\npleasure which I have taken in caring for my pet cow, and in providing\r\nfor her wants, and the pride I feel in exhibiting both my cow and the\r\ndelicious rich milk and yellow butter, with which she so bountifully\r\nsupplies us, amply repays me for my part of the labor. I have made no\r\naccount of using concentrated food, such as oil-cake and cotton-seed\r\nmeal, for the reason that I have had very little experience in the use\r\nof them. Whenever an animal has become thin and poor, these articles of\r\nfood may be used to advantage to increase the flesh and bring the animal\r\ninto good condition. But I never let my cow get poor, and I find that\r\ngood hay, with corn, oats, and bran, answers every purpose, and is fully\r\nadequate to all her requirements. My system of rotation is as follows:\r\nThe one-eighth acre of clover sod of the preceding year is well manured\r\neither during the winter or in the spring, and well fitted up and sown to\r\nbeets or mangels. This crop occupies the land during the whole season.\r\nThe same plot is again plowed the next spring for sowed corn. After this\r\ncrop is off it is again manured and sown to rye, and the following spring\r\nis again seeded to clover. It is kept in clover one year, yielding two\r\ncrops during the season, after which it is treated as before. Each of\r\nthe four plots undergoes the same treatment; thus a complete rotation is\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING A COW ON CAPE COD.\r\n\r\nBY M. T. T. NICKERSON, SOUTH DENNIS, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe live in a section of country where nature has not been lavish with\r\nher gifts. Our soil is sandy and only produces paying crops by high\r\ncultivation. Farming with us comes near to being one of the lost arts.\r\nWe are not tillers of the soil. Living, as we do, within sound of the\r\nAtlantic surf, as it beats its everlasting measure upon our coast, we,\r\nfrom associations of birth and early training, plow the Ocean for a\r\nliving, the furrows frequently stretching from pole to pole, or to the\r\nopposite side of the globe. Few, very few, keep cows. A large proportion\r\nof our people do not keep any, and it is not common to find many that\r\nhave more than one.\r\n\r\nWe keep a good grade Jersey, and will give our way of keeping one cow,\r\nhaving learned long ago, that stock of any kind paid for good care.\r\nKeeping a lot of cattle or hogs, or poultry, and simply feeding what\r\nwe happen to have, or what we can buy cheap, leaving them to shift for\r\nthemselves in cold and stormy weather, or giving them wet uncomfortable\r\nstables, always results in disease to the stock and loss to the owner.\r\n\r\nWe sow as early in the spring as the ground is in condition to work,\r\nforty rods with a mixture of oats and peas, and forty rods in spring\r\nrye. We commence cutting our oats and peas as soon as the peas begin to\r\nbloom. Where we have a good stand, a rod per day, divided in three feeds,\r\nmorning, noon, and night, is generally enough. As soon as we have cut\r\nabout ten rods we plow under the stubble, and plant Early Minnesota Sweet\r\nCorn—rows two and one half feet apart—hills two feet in the rows, leaving\r\ntwo and three stalks in a hill. The next ten rods we serve in the same\r\nmanner. If our rye is now grown enough to cut with profit we commence\r\nfeeding it, and cut the balance of our oats and peas, and cure them for\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIf our rye is not fit to cut for soiling, we continue to use our oats and\r\npeas until it is, and then cure for winter what is left. As soon as the\r\nlast of our oats are off, we plant about four rods with beets (mangel\r\nwurzel). We prefer the Globe varieties, as the yield is better on our\r\nsoil. The balance of our oat-and-pea ground we sow with Hungarian grass.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we have cut ten rods of our rye, we manage as with our oats,\r\nturn under the stubble and again plant sweet corn. The earlier the\r\nvariety the better. We prefer the Early Minnesota. As soon as we have\r\ncleared off the next ten rods of our rye, we plant from two to four rods\r\nwith turnips. The balance we sow with a mixture of Hungarian and the\r\nearliest “Canada Gray” pea. We now feed our rye until our first planting\r\nof corn and Hungarian will do to feed, when we turn under the rest of the\r\nrye stubble (curing what is left of the rye for winter), sow half with\r\nHungarian and the balance we sow (not plant) with sweet corn. As soon as\r\nour first planting of corn is cut up, we sow two or three rows broadcast\r\nwith flat turnips, some of the strap-leaved varieties, hoeing or raking\r\nthem in by hand. We continue to plant or sow some quick-growing variety\r\nof corn, peas, grass, grain, or roots, even when it is very doubtful if\r\nwe shall receive any return for our time and work; but we frequently get\r\na fair yield from our third planting. I presume a great many will be\r\nsceptical in regard to this “third crop business.” It must be remembered\r\nthat our first sowing is made very early in the spring, and that we do\r\nnot wait until any of our forage crops mature, but we cut them long\r\nbefore they would be ripe, thereby shortening the time of their growth\r\nand leaving the ground to be planted with something else.\r\n\r\nThe above is no iron rule, but subject to great variations. Our plan is\r\nto sow as early as possible in the spring with the earliest maturing\r\ngrass or grain we can get, and from the time we commence cutting until\r\nthere is no possibility of getting any return. We sow and plant wherever\r\nwe have a few rods of bare ground, as soon as any of our crops are\r\nmaturing or there is something coming forward to take its place. We cut\r\nand cure what is left for winter. We advise close seeding in all cases,\r\nroots, of course, excepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW KEPT ON HALF AN ACRE.\r\n\r\nIf the season is favorable, we manage to keep our one cow nicely on half\r\nan acre, or rather on the fodder grown on half an acre. But sometimes, on\r\naccount of drouth or late frost, we are obliged to buy a little hay in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us to say how much feed must be bought. We generally\r\nhave a bag of corn (two bushels), and a bag of oats (two and a half\r\nbushels), ground together, feeding from two to four quarts a day,\r\naccording to the amount of roots used, and the season of the year,\r\nfeeding meal very sparingly in summer. We frequently reserve two or three\r\nrods in the spring for early turnips, to be fed when large enough for\r\nprofit, but always feed turnips immediately after milking to prevent\r\nflavoring the milk. We generally have a few cabbage plants started to\r\nset where the corn misses, or the beets or turnips fail to come up, or\r\nin any corner or by-place where there is room for a cabbage to grow.\r\nSometimes we reserve a few rods for cabbages late in the season, as we\r\nfind them excellent for a change of feed either winter or summer. We\r\nadvise, in all cases, the use of the earliest varieties of grass, grain,\r\nor vegetables, as we cannot afford the time and ground occupied by some\r\nof the larger and taller growing varieties, being convinced, from actual\r\nexperience, that two and three crops of early varieties, although small,\r\nare more profitable than one crop of the larger late varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STABLE AND THE MANURE CELLAR\r\n\r\nThe stable for our cow is a shed nine by sixteen, built on the south side\r\nof our carriage and wagon house. One-half of the shed is partitioned off\r\nand enclosed for winter use or stormy weather; the other half of the\r\nshed is open on the south side, and our yard is about sixteen by thirty,\r\nincluding the shed. We think it would be better to have it larger, but we\r\nget along with it nicely. We find the best way to dispose of her manure\r\nis to have a small cellar underneath the stable, with cemented bottom and\r\nsides, so as to be water tight, the stable to have a tight floor with a\r\ngutter behind the cow to receive the droppings and urine, with a scuttle\r\nor trap door in the gutter to let it all go into the cellar. For bedding,\r\nwe use forest leaves, and use them liberally. Where forest leaves cannot\r\nbe obtained, any refuse hay or straw will answer, but the cow as well as\r\nthe horse should have plenty of good dry bedding. To mix with the urine\r\nand droppings of the cow, we put into the cellar, sea-weed, muck, turf,\r\nslops from the house, and soap suds, or anything we think will make good\r\ncompost. We gather up the droppings from the yard and throw them into\r\nthe cellar. We keep our yard well laid with forest leaves. If those are\r\nnot available, we use the next best thing we can get. In the fall, when\r\nwe cart the manure out of the cellar, we gather up what has accumulated\r\nin the yard and put it into the cellar. In this way we save all of the\r\nmanure, and in excellent condition. Now, to make it better and save the\r\nlabor of pitching it over, we keep a pig where he can have access to\r\nthe cellar, and if not disposed to work, we keep him on short feed and\r\nscatter corn in the cellar, so that in order to get it, he will have to\r\nroot the whole mass over in good shape.\r\n\r\nWe cart our manure out in the fall, distributing it over our land as\r\nevenly as possible, and plow it under as deep as we can. We do not sow\r\nanything for next year’s use, as we think we get a better return from our\r\nland to sow early in the spring and continue it through the summer. It\r\nis a mistaken idea, or rather a grave blunder, to undertake to grow good\r\ncrops of anything without the liberal use of manures. As soon as our land\r\nwill do to work in the spring, we sow our oats, peas, and rye, giving a\r\ntop dressing of guano, superphosphates, or bone meal, which we repeat\r\nwith each successive sowing, also giving each hill of corn and rows of\r\nbeets and turnips a small quantity. We alternate the top dressings, that\r\nis, if we use superphosphate the first sowing, we use ground bone or\r\nguano the second, and vice versa, as we find the continuous use of any\r\none kind of manure or fertilizer is as injurious as continuous planting\r\nof corn or potatoes, without rotating with something else.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRELS FOR KEEPING ROOTS.\r\n\r\nWe have a way of our own for keeping our roots in the absence of a\r\nvegetable cellar, or when we do not want them in the house cellar. We\r\ntake any old barrels and set them in the ground, the chiner just coming\r\nto the top of the ground (we do not want a head in either end of the\r\nbarrels). Into these headless barrels we put our beets, turnips, cabbage,\r\netc. As the weather grows cold we cover the barrels with some loose\r\nboards. Whenever it is cold enough to freeze hard, we throw over them\r\nenough hay or straw to keep out the wet. By this method we can, with\r\nvery little trouble at any time, get out a barrel or part of a barrel of\r\nroots. In this way the roots keep in fine condition. Late in the spring,\r\nturnips and beets will be as brittle and good as when pulled in the fall.\r\nOur subject is “keeping one cow,” but any one that feels disposed to try\r\nit, will find the above a very fine way to keep turnips, beets, cabbage,\r\nor celery, for family use.\r\n\r\nWe prefer to have our cow calve about the first of April, as we then have\r\ntime to make veal of the calf before we begin to make grass butter. There\r\nis generally, in any place, a better demand for milk through the winter,\r\nand better prices, hence if one wishes to sell milk and buy butter, it\r\nwould perhaps be better to have her calve in the fall.\r\n\r\nWe hardly feel competent to advise, if help is needed in calving. As her\r\ntime of calving draws nigh, we give our cow extra care and attention. If\r\nthe bowels are kept in a healthy condition, we apprehend there is rarely\r\ntrouble, from the fact that our cows have always calved without the need\r\nof help.\r\n\r\nIf there is ready sale for milk at paying prices, we would dispose of the\r\ncalf in some way, when it is a few days old, but if milk is not salable\r\nat good prices, it is better to let the calf have the milk until from\r\nfour to six weeks old, and then if the butcher will not give us a fair\r\nprice for it, we get some one to dress it for us, and sell it among our\r\nneighbors, who are generally glad to buy it. In that way we get from\r\neight to twelve dollars for our calf. We think it as well for the cow to\r\nkeep the calf for that length of time. It seems to satisfy a necessity of\r\nher nature to have her baby suck and draw its nourishment from her. We\r\nknow of no better picture of contentment than to see an old cow suckling\r\nher calf after being away from it all day.\r\n\r\nWe advise regular hours of milking night and morning, and kind, gentle\r\ntreatment, carding in winter, cleanliness and thorough ventilation\r\nof stable at all times. In summertime, if confined in a yard, a thin\r\nsheet to keep off the flies will be found very comfortable for the cow,\r\nand profitable to the owner. I presume some will ridicule the idea of\r\nblanketing the cow, but why not as well as the horse? Again, if confined\r\nin a yard, she should have plenty of clean pure water, and plenty of\r\nshade. Keeping a cow, with us, is not altogether a matter of fancy or\r\npleasure, but of convenience, economy, comfort, profit, and health, in\r\nhaving pure sweet milk and fresh butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFALFA OR LUCERN.\r\n\r\nBY SAM’L C. HAMMER, DOWNEY CITY, CAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lived in Tennessee, in Texas, and now reside in California. I have\r\nbeen using Alfalfa for some eight or ten years, and from my own personal\r\ncare of and attention to this article, I maintain one can obtain more\r\nmilk the year round from it, without change to other food, than from any\r\none thing grown. Besides, Alfalfa can be grown at less expense, and is\r\nattended with less labor, whether fed green or cured, than any other feed.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa can be grown in Canada, it is said. If so, then any one has the\r\nchance to try this wonderful friend to the farmer. Once sown on deeply\r\ncultivated land, free of weeds, it is good for ten years, or even more,\r\nwith us. Twenty pounds is abundant seed for an acre—some think too much;\r\nbut it should be sown thickly. Let it stand thick, and it is finer and\r\nmore tender. Where sown sparsely it becomes woody and coarse. It can be\r\ncut here as early as March, where mowing and not grazing is adhered to,\r\nand it should never be grazed or “staked” (fed off by tethered cattle).\r\nFrom seven to nine cuttings can be obtained from it, and from fifteen to\r\ntwenty tons of cured hay a year made to the acre; that is, if on good\r\nland and if the crop fully occupies the ground, and is cut just as a few\r\nscattering blooms are observed. This hay must be cured as rapidly as\r\npossible, raked in windrows and bunched the second day, rather letting it\r\ncure in bunches than in any other manner, to prevent leaves falling off;\r\nthen housing or “shedding” it soon as possible, sprinkling salt through\r\nit as stacked, to prevent mould.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa needs no top-dressing with fertilizers and manure, but simply\r\na severe cross-harrowing with a very sharp-toothed harrow, bearing the\r\nweight of a man. The more the Alfalfa is torn and split up the better it\r\nwill grow. This harrowing should be done in spring before it commences\r\nits first growth. After growing a few years, the stools project, in\r\nmany places, above the surface of the ground. If an implement could be\r\ndevised for the purpose of cutting off all these old stalks just below\r\nthe surface, then seed lightly, giving a good harrowing, the plants would\r\nbe renewed, and would thicken up rapidly, for wherever a stalk or root is\r\ncut off, dozens of new shoots spring up in its place.\r\n\r\nHowever, I advocate a change of diet for brutes as well as mankind, and\r\ntherefore take for the family cow a half acre of most excellent ground.\r\nI will suppose that one half of it—that is a quarter acre—is well set\r\nin Alfalfa. The rest I would have plowed twice, very deep, smoothed and\r\nlaid off in drills for carrots, which, at the proper season (with us in\r\nFebruary or March), I would enrich in the furrows with any well-rotted\r\nmanure. For Alfalfa almost any good soil suits, for I find it adapts\r\nitself to various soils and endures a great deal of rough treatment, but\r\nin order to get the best results it should be well treated. I prefer a\r\nmoderately sandy soil, which is naturally moist. On dry, mellow ground,\r\nit will send down a tap-root ten feet. I have drawn roots out of very\r\nsandy soil when digging post holes that would measure six feet. They seek\r\nmoisture during dry weather, and although I have had Alfalfa die down,\r\nthe ground being parched and cracked, yet when the fall or winter rains\r\nbegin, it springs up in a few days.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Alfalfa comes in, feed it alone, salting as suits one’s\r\nown idea. When the first scattering blooms appear I would cut the\r\nremainder—namely, that which had not been cut each day for the cow.\r\nI would then cure it as rapidly as possible, and put it under cover,\r\nsprinkling salt over it. I now advocate and practice feeding the cured\r\nhay in preference to the green. By the latter you obtain a greater flow\r\nof milk, but with the former I consider the milk richer, and this is the\r\nexperience of dairymen with whom I have conversed.\r\n\r\nA cow learns to eat the cured fodder almost as readily as the green,\r\nand all danger of bloat is obviated. Some may think because I am in\r\nCalifornia that irrigation makes some difference, but my Alfalfa grows\r\nwithout it. I cut mine six times last summer, 1879, and it was an\r\nexceptionally dry and hot season. Our rains fall mostly in winter, and\r\nthat has to do us until the next winter.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the cow, I would place her in a corral or lot, we’ll say, of\r\none-fourth to half an acre in size, giving her a comfortable house or\r\nshed for winter, in which I think she should be fastened by a closed door\r\nin cold rainy weather. At other times she should be allowed the run of\r\nthe lot, having access to good fresh water at least twice a day. Shade\r\ntrees for summer’s hot sun are indispensable. In this lot or corral you\r\nhave all the manure where it can be gathered up daily or weekly, and\r\ncomposted or housed, ready to be spread on the ground for future crops.\r\nSome would say a cow should be curried every morning. They certainly do\r\nenjoy it, but many California farmers never saw such a thing done. I\r\nthink it should be done just before the animals begin to shed their old\r\ncoats; afterwards I see little use of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMANENT GRASS AS SOILING CROP.\r\n\r\nBY P. S. NORRIS, ANGELICA, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe keeping of one cow seems to be generally regarded as a matter of so\r\nlittle importance, and one so simple in its nature, that even persons of\r\nlow intelligence can scarcely fail of success. But to keep a cow in such\r\na manner as to receive the greatest return for the least possible expense\r\nin labor and money, requires the most careful study of the nature and\r\nhabits, endurance, needs, and the productive capabilities of the animal,\r\nand involves scientific principles which are deeper and broader than\r\nthose generally applied to the keeping of stock of any kind.\r\n\r\nIf the average quantity of milk be ten quarts per day during the year,\r\nand the expense twenty cents per day, the milk will cost two cents per\r\nquart, and if the milk is worth three cents per quart, there is a net\r\nprofit of fifty per cent upon the cost of keeping, or ten cents per day.\r\nBut if the quantity of milk be eight quarts per day, and the expense\r\ntwelve cents, the milk will cost only one and a half cents per quart, or\r\ntwelve cents per day. Then three cents per quart for the milk will leave\r\nan actual profit of one hundred per cent upon the cost of keeping, or\r\ntwelve cents per day.\r\n\r\nOne acre, and even something less, put in good condition, well fertilized\r\nand properly seeded, will be ample for a pasture, and will furnish\r\nplenty of nutritious feed, upon which, with proper care, the cow will\r\nyield an abundant flow of rich and delicious milk; while one-third of\r\nan acre of similar soil will produce sufficient hay for the winter. The\r\npasture should be divided into two parts, the cow to be kept a few days\r\nin each alternately, with plenty of pure water and shade. Where land is\r\nhigh, as it always is in towns and villages of any size, the practice of\r\n“soiling,” as it is usually termed, is the most profitable way to keep a\r\ncow. For this purpose, a small yard, some twenty to thirty feet square,\r\nperhaps, or of such size as can be afforded, may be provided, containing\r\nan open shed—the more open the better for the summer—only so that it will\r\nshelter the animal from the heat of the sun and the storms. The yard and\r\nshed should be kept as clean and dry as possible, or the cow will become\r\nill. Plenty of pure water is indispensable at all times. A comfortable\r\nplace for the cow to lie down is very important. Sawdust, forest leaves,\r\nold straw, or other convenient and cheap litter will answer for bedding;\r\nor, if the ground be smooth, clean and dry, that may be sufficient. The\r\nmanure is to be carefully collected and placed under another shed, or\r\nother convenient place under shelter provided for the purpose, and, to\r\nprevent bad odors, the heap should receive, once in two or three days,\r\na light covering of muck, leaves, sods, weeds dug up in the garden or\r\nelsewhere, or fine earth—almost anything that will rot—and thus not only\r\nprevent the unpleasantness and unhealthfulness of such odors, and the\r\nloss that would result from their escape, but add largely to the size\r\nand value of the manure heap. Now, have about two-thirds of an acre of\r\nland, highly manured, and, with the exception of about fourteen square\r\nrods, well seeded with a variety of nutritious grasses. This quantity\r\nof land, if properly enriched and cultivated, will keep a cow the year\r\nround, and keep her well, without purchasing any feed. A good rack or\r\nother arrangement in the shade is necessary, in which to feed, so that\r\nnothing shall be wasted. Then, quite early in the season, the grass upon\r\nthis rich soil will be large enough to be cut and fed to the cow. While\r\nthe ground is sufficiently moist, in the fore part of the season, the\r\ngrass will grow very rapidly, and, when the soil becomes a little too\r\ndry, about half a bushel of plaster, or twice as much lime, or two or\r\nthree bushels of wood ashes, scattered upon it, will usually renew the\r\nvigor and freshness of the crop, which may be repeated with benefit two\r\nor three times before the end of the growing season. Another excellent\r\nfertilizer, which may be applied during the summer, is the waste water\r\nfrom the house, such as soap suds, dish water, and any other slops that\r\nare to be thrown away. These should all be saved and scattered upon the\r\ngrass from pails, if no better method is ordinarily practicable, and it\r\nwill pay a person many times over for the trouble. A light top-dressing\r\nof manure from the cow-yard or shed will be necessary every year, or\r\nevery second year certainly, applied in the fall, or early in the spring.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the grass has fairly got into blossom, it should be\r\nimmediately cut and well-cured for winter use, unless it may be necessary\r\nto save a small quantity to feed until that portion which was first cut\r\nfor the cow shall be ready to cut again. Grass should never be allowed\r\nto stand until the seed has formed, as just previous to that time it is\r\nmore nutritious than at any other period. Hay cut thus early will make\r\nmuch more and better milk, and keep a cow in better condition than that\r\nwhich is cut later. A portion of the grass can be mown a second time for\r\nhay, and still leave enough for green feed until foddering time. The\r\nexact proportion of the crop to be made into hay must, of course, depend\r\nupon circumstances. All that is not needed for summer use should be cured\r\nfor winter, and the quantity will, generally, be sufficient, if, indeed,\r\nthere is not an overplus, as will quite likely occur in many cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—SHORTHORN COW “COLD CREAM.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST KINDS OF GRASSES.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know what kinds of grasses are best adapted to the\r\nproduction of milk and butter, for both summer and winter feeding; and\r\nupon this depends, in a great measure, the profits to be realized. The\r\npractice of seeding with a single kind of grass, or even with a mixture\r\nof clover and timothy, is not a good one. Four of the most nutritious\r\nand productive kinds of grass, including timothy, white clover, and\r\nsuch other varieties as are well adapted to the particular nature and\r\ncondition of the soil, are none too many to be sown together, for pasture\r\nor meadow. Five quarts of timothy, three of white clover, six of orchard\r\ngrass, and three of red-top (if the ground is quite moist), or other\r\ngrass suited to the soil, are about the proper quantities and proportions\r\nfor general use, on an acre of land. Such a mixture, upon a rich soil,\r\nwill produce fully twice as much feed as any one kind upon the same soil.\r\nWhite clover produces a greater quantity and better quality of milk and\r\nbutter than any of the other varieties of grass, and the quantity of feed\r\nproduced by such a mixture, will astonish any person not acquainted with\r\nthe facts. Besides producing much more abundantly, they furnish something\r\nof a variety of feed, which is greatly beneficial in the manufacture of\r\nboth milk and flesh. Weeds injure the flavor of milk and butter, and\r\nshould never be in the food for cows. An acre of rich soil, well seeded\r\nwith a good selection and variety of perennial grasses, will produce six\r\ntons of well-cured hay in one season; by mowing twice, and, by early\r\ncutting, this can be done without difficulty. In my own experience, the\r\nfirst mowing has given at the rate of full four tons per acre, and the\r\nsecond, somewhat injured by drouth, two tons. Some writers recommend\r\nthe sowing of one or more of the rank growing annuals, as being more\r\nproductive; but a careful consideration of the subject, accompanied by\r\nexperiments, discloses the fact that the extra expense of preparing the\r\nground and seeding annually, overbalances any increased quantity of feed\r\nproduced, especially when the coarser and less nutritious nature of the\r\nfeed is taken into the account. There is nothing suited to this climate\r\nand latitude, that will answer a better purpose as food for stock, than\r\nsuch perennials as timothy, red-top, orchard-grass, blue-grass, the\r\nclovers, etc., when sown upon a rich soil, thick enough to completely\r\ncover the ground and to insure fine, soft hay, when cut at the proper\r\ntime and well cured. I have omitted red clover in the mixture of grasses,\r\nbecause soils adapted to that variety will produce white clover equally\r\nas well, and in about the same quantity, while the white gives a much\r\nbetter flavor to milk and butter, and an increased quantity. Blue-grass,\r\neither green or cured, is excellent feed for cattle, but is unprofitable\r\non account of the small product, and that coming only in the fore part\r\nof the season, falling, as it does, just at the time when fresh feed is\r\nmost needed. Red and white clover may be advantageously mixed with the\r\ntrue grasses, in many localities where the soil is suitable, though the\r\nclovers are likely to “run out” in a couple of years, and leave their\r\nplaces to be filled with inferior fodder plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKING THREE TIMES A DAY.\r\n\r\nDuring the heat of summer, the cow should be milked three times a day,\r\nat regular intervals—about five o’clock in the morning, one in the\r\nafternoon, and at nine in the evening. The quantity of milk and butter\r\nis considerably increased, and the quality improved, by this practice.\r\nThe milk is injured by remaining in the udder through the heat of the\r\nday, and the cow is made uncomfortable, which, of necessity, diminishes\r\nher usefulness. When cows are milked but twice a day in hot weather, the\r\nudder becomes too much heated and feverish, and the milk is in a similar\r\ncondition—the cream seems to be melted, the milk soon becomes sour,\r\nthe cream does not rise well, and the butter is soft and oily. These\r\ndifficulties, almost universally attending butter-making at this time of\r\nthe year, are mostly overcome by the practice of milking three times a\r\nday, and the cow being near at hand, it is a small matter.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a cow should be milked, will depend on her\r\ncapabilities for giving milk a longer or shorter time. Some will give\r\nmilk the year round, while others will “go dry” three or four months, or\r\nlonger, in spite of all efforts to keep them in milk a longer period.\r\nBut, as a rule, it is better for a cow to go dry some eight weeks,\r\ngiving time for fleshing up a little, and gaining strength for another\r\nseason. The cow will be more vigorous, and the flow of milk more abundant\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELLSWORTH OR “BARRE” SYSTEM OF FEEDING.\r\n\r\nBY D. D. SLADE, CHESTNUT HILL, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own experience, as well as that of others, has taught me that a cow\r\nproperly fed twice a day, will give more milk, and be in better condition\r\nthan when fed three times, or more frequently. This plan, which is known\r\nas the “Barre” system of feeding, may be adopted throughout the year,\r\nalthough it has been chiefly applied to the winter months, in the region\r\nwhere it has been most extensively pursued.\r\n\r\nThe poorest quality of fodder is given first, at the commencement of each\r\nmeal, and before this is entirely consumed, another foddering of a better\r\nquality is placed before the cow, and finally a third, of the best hay.\r\nAfter this is consumed, roots, grain, etc., may be given immediately.\r\nIn this way, the animal employs on an average about two hours at a\r\nmeal—which occurs only twice during the day, with an interval of from six\r\nto seven hours between the morning and evening. Water, always slightly\r\nwarmed, in cold weather, is offered at once, and it will be found that\r\nthe cow will not drink so freely after she has begun to chew the cud. No\r\nfood should be given between the meals, which should be at regular hours,\r\nand served with punctuality. So long as she chews her cud, which in the\r\nwell-fed cow is about six hours, we can rest assured that her digestive\r\norgans have work enough before them, and that we cannot reasonably call\r\nupon them to do more.\r\n\r\nThe why and the wherefore of this system of feeding, which we heartily\r\nadvocate, are well told in the words of Mr. Ellsworth, the originator.\r\n“The idea that a cow needs only two meals a day during the winter season,\r\nas long as she is kept upon hay or other dried fodder, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that she will eat much oftener, when obtaining her living from\r\nthe pasture, may appear to the casual observer, to be contradictory to\r\nitself; but on a closer investigation we shall notice a rational, and I\r\nbelieve satisfactory reason for it. Of all the elements of which grass is\r\ncomposed, by far the larger part is water, which must render it much more\r\nbulky than an equal amount of hay, and for this reason, more is required\r\nto supply the wants of the system. During the season, therefore, when the\r\ncow must live by her own exertions, she must labor most of the time to\r\nobtain the requisite amount of nourishment, which she is not required to\r\ndo while in the barn. We must not forget, also, that pastures in general\r\nare kept down so close during the greater part of the summer, that only\r\nby continual labor can her wants be satisfied.”\r\n\r\nThe same rules are applicable to the soiling of the cow during the summer\r\nmonths, the only difference being that green food is given in the place\r\nof dry. This may consist of rye, oats, barley, millet, or Hungarian\r\ngrass, corn, English grass, etc., cut while in the milk. It will\r\nfrequently be found that a proportion of dried hay will also at times be\r\nhighly relished, and may be essential to allay any excessive looseness of\r\nthe bowels, which may be produced by the succulent food.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of eating, the milking and other necessary work may be\r\ndone about the cow house, so that time may be thus economized.\r\n\r\nAs to the requisite amount of food, it may be taken as a safe rule,\r\nthat a milch cow demands in food, three per cent of her weight. An\r\naverage cow, then, will require from eighteen to twenty pounds of hay,\r\nin addition to a peck or two of roots per day, or the equivalent of this\r\namount in green food during the summer months.\r\n\r\nIf the hay is good, and has been properly cured, or if rowen can be\r\ngiven, then there will be little or no demand for grain in any form. If\r\notherwise, from one to two quarts of Indian meal, with two quarts of\r\nshorts per day, should be fed out, if we are to expect a good flow of\r\nmilk. We have found excellent results to follow the practice of stirring\r\nthe meal and shorts, or a portion of these, into a bucket of warm water,\r\nand offering this mixture immediately after the animal has consumed her\r\ndry food, and before any roots are eaten. This extra amount of fluid will\r\nbe greedily taken, in this way, without any interference with a liberal\r\nsupply of water at the end of the meal. Salt, at all times, should be\r\naccessible to the cow, and perhaps this article may be best supplied by\r\nplacing a large lump of rock salt in the manger, to be licked as her\r\nwants may require.\r\n\r\nTaking Central New England, as before remarked, as the latitude of\r\nexperimentation, it will be found that one square rod of oats, Hungarian\r\ngrass, barley, rye, and similar grasses, in proper condition, growing\r\non land in a high state of cultivation, is amply sufficient for a cow\r\nfor one day. Or in other words, to be within perfectly safe bounds, and\r\nconsidering the chances of partial failure, we may say, that under the\r\nconditions above mentioned, forty square rods, or one quarter of an acre,\r\nwill produce ample food for one cow for thirty-five days. On this basis,\r\nupon one acre can be grown soiling material sufficient to keep a cow\r\nthrough the year, allowing also, a liberal amount of roots. How is this\r\nto be done?\r\n\r\nWe may assume that a man takes possession of a place on the first of\r\nApril, which is the customary time in New England. Let him select an acre\r\nof the land most suitable to the purpose in view. Let him set apart forty\r\nsquare rods, or one quarter of it, for summer soiling, twenty square\r\nrods for the growth of roots, and the remaining one hundred square rods\r\nfor crops, to be properly cured for winter use. The land having been\r\nthoroughly prepared, that is, in high tilth, sow as early in April as\r\npossible, on ten square rods, oats, or spring rye, at the rate of four\r\nbushels to the acre. This will be fit to cut, for summer soiling, in the\r\nfirst week of July.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth to twentieth of April, sow the next ten rods in a\r\nsimilar manner. This will be ready to cut about the fifteenth of July. On\r\nthe first of May, sow oats or barley on the next ten rods, which will be\r\nfit for cropping August first.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth to the fifteenth of May put in the next five rods in drills,\r\nflat corn at the rate of three bushels to the acre, and a week later the\r\nremaining five rods are to be treated in a similar manner. This will give\r\nsucculent food up to September.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first ten rods of land, which were cleared of oats by the\r\ntenth of July, has been again prepared properly, sow Hungarian grass\r\nat the same rate as before stated. Do the same also with the next lot,\r\ncleared of oats by the first of August, putting in barley, however, in\r\nplace of millet, as this is not injured by the early frosts. Barley may\r\nalso be sown on the lot which was cropped about the tenth of August, or\r\nif this grain has already occupied the land, we may substitute corn,\r\nusing a stimulating fertilizer to give it a rapid growth. In this way,\r\nwe shall have a succession of green food up to November, augmented also\r\nby the tops of the roots when thinned out or when harvested. The larger\r\nvarieties of the sweet corn may be substituted for the flat, and is\r\nperhaps better relished, although not affording perhaps so large a yield.\r\n\r\nThe twenty square rods devoted to root culture must receive attention as\r\nearly in the season as possible—certainly by the first of May. The ground\r\nhaving been deeply plowed or spaded, and thoroughly manured, should be\r\nmade perfectly level. The large sugar beet and the mangold wurzel are the\r\nmost valuable for the milch cow, and may be sown at the rate of about\r\nsix pounds to the acre. During their growth, careful attention should\r\nbe given to them by keeping them free from weeds, and the surface of\r\nthe ground loose and fresh. A good yield would give an average of about\r\nsix hundred and fifty bushels to the acre, which will be eighty bushels\r\nfor the plot of twenty square rods, and allowing the cow one-third of\r\na bushel per day for the eight months of dry food. The roots should be\r\nsecured from frost by placing them in the cellar or in deep pits well\r\nprotected. The hundred rods which is to be devoted to the winter feeding,\r\nmust be put down to oats at the same time, and exactly in the same manner\r\nas the first ten rods for summer soiling. Cut these when in their most\r\nsucculent condition, which will be probably from the fifth to the tenth\r\nof July. Cure them well, and house or stack them in a suitable manner.\r\nThe land having been again suitably prepared, the preceding crop must be\r\nat once followed by Hungarian grass, a bushel and a half to the acre,\r\nwhich will be fit for cutting as soon as the head is formed, which will\r\nbe in about six weeks from the time of sowing. Cure it as far as possible\r\nin the cock, which will render it more nutritious.\r\n\r\nThe one hundred square rods being again cleared and put in order during\r\nthe autumn, sow winter rye at the rate of three bushels to the acre.\r\nThis will be ready to cut in the spring, and will afford green food much\r\nearlier than in any other way for soiling. If there is a surplus of any\r\nof the green crops, convert it into hay for winter use.\r\n\r\nFrom the two croppings of the one hundred square rods, treated in the\r\nabove manner, a fair yield will be a ton and a quarter of oats cured\r\nas hay, with an equal amount of Hungarian grass. Thus we have two and\r\none-half tons of fodder, which will be amply sufficient for one cow\r\nthrough the eight months in which she is not receiving the green crops,\r\nallowing her the amount of hay per day which we have stated as necessary\r\nin conjunction with the roots and grain, in the quantities before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nOf course, where the feeding commences in April, if the place be taken\r\nin that month, food must be bought by the owner to last until the summer\r\nsoiling in July. In the succeeding year, however, the crop of winter rye\r\nwill come in early, to be used in conjunction with the dried fodder of\r\nthe previous summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW STABLED IN THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are cases where a single cow may be kept with profit and\r\nadvantage, and that, too, in perfect health, without the agency of\r\nland, in the immediate suburbs of a town or city, or even within the\r\nvery precincts of a city. It is requisite, for these conditions, that\r\nprovision should be made to allow the animal to breathe fresh air, and to\r\nenjoy a certain amount of sunlight daily. Without these none should be\r\nkept. Exercise is not essential to the well-being of the milch cow; she\r\nis an animal of repose, and if she is offered every effort to ruminate,\r\nwill be perfectly contented, and will do her duty. Attention to the best\r\npossible condition of the skin, as regards cleanliness, is very important\r\nwhen so closely housed.\r\n\r\nThe food which, under these circumstances, must be purchased, can be\r\nobtained with much economy, on account of the propinquity to the places\r\nof sale; and although we do not advocate the use of brewers’ grain, or of\r\nany other cheap articles which are too often substituted for the natural\r\nfood of the cow, viz., grass, green or dry—a small quantity, especially\r\nwhen supplemented by the vegetable refuse from the house table, may be\r\nadvantageously employed conjointly with good hay.\r\n\r\nFinally, it may be said that no animal better repays care and attention,\r\nand can with more truth be called the poor man’s friend, than the cow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS REFUTE PREJUDICE.\r\n\r\nBY D. B. CHAPMAN, NEW LONDON, CT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy it was the prevailing opinion in the section of country\r\nwhere I was raised, that it was better that a cow should be rather thin\r\nin flesh at the time of calving than otherwise. There was but very little\r\ngrain fed in winter, to any stock in that section, except to working\r\noxen. Cows in milk were fed hay, while dry cows, and young stock, were\r\nfed on straw or corn stalks. The result was that at the time of calving,\r\ncows were generally thin enough to conform to the popular idea of a\r\nproper condition. Cows giving a large yield of milk were scarce enough\r\nin those days, and it was very seldom that you would meet one that would\r\nyield ten quarts of milk per day (beer measure), during the flush of\r\nfeed. My faith in the theory, that a cow should be thin in flesh at the\r\ntime of calving, received a very severe shock, very soon after I became\r\nthe owner of one, and experience and observation have only served to\r\nconfirm my doubts of its correctness.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848, I purchased my first cow. I came across her some\r\ntwenty miles from home. She had just calved, and displayed a very large\r\nudder. Her owner warranted her to give twelve quarts of milk per day, and\r\nto be, in every respect, a good family cow. The cow suited my fancy in\r\nevery particular, save one, she was too fat. But having nine points in\r\nher favor, I did not feel disposed to forego her purchase for the want\r\nof the tenth. When I drove her home, the adverse criticism on her was\r\nimmense, solely on account of her condition. Said an old farmer to me:\r\n“That is a fancy cow, just suited for some rich man, who can afford to\r\nindulge his fancy, and expend for her keeping, twice as much as the value\r\nof her milk. You will find that you have got to keep her in just the\r\ncondition that she is now in, or you will get no milk. If you do not keep\r\nher in this condition, you will find she will shrink in milk, before she\r\nshrinks in flesh, and she won’t give half as much, on the same keeping,\r\nas she would if she was no fatter than my cows.”\r\n\r\nI must own, that after listening to this and that criticism in the same\r\nstrain, I felt a little sick of my bargain, and would have willingly sold\r\nher at a discount, but no purchaser appearing, I concluded to make the\r\nbest of a bad bargain.\r\n\r\nMy purchase was made April second. Twelve hundred pounds of hay furnished\r\nher with feed until the eighteenth of May. I then hired a pasture, for\r\nfifteen dollars, where I kept her until November, when I sold her.\r\n\r\nI found that, although the cow lost flesh under my keeping, and a good\r\ndeal of it too, she gave quite as much milk as she was recommended to\r\ngive, and at the time she was sold, her account stood as follows, no\r\naccount having been made of the milk used in the family, then consisting\r\nof three persons:\r\n\r\n                               CR.\r\n\r\n    By sale of Milk, at 6 cents per quart      $74.20\r\n       do.

But instead\r\nof a fat cow then, she was thin enough to afford a good study of animal\r\nanatomy. She had had no other feed than corn stalks, for the two months\r\nthat she had been dry, and was as much thinner than when I sold her; as\r\nshe was at that time thinner than when I first bought her. In fact, she\r\nhad been subjected to a gradual system of depletion for a year.\r\n\r\nI sold her on the first of October, following, when her account stood\r\nas follows, no account having been made of the milk used in the family,\r\nnumbering three persons, as before:\r\n\r\n                               DR.\r\n\r\n    To purchase                                $35.00\r\n       Hay                                      12.00\r\n       Service                                   0.50\r\n       Meal                                      6.00\r\n       Pasture, the same as the previous year   15.00\r\n                                              ------- $68.50\r\n\r\n                               CR.\r\n\r\n    By sale of Milk, at 6 cents per quart      $51.30\r\n        do.

The yield for the second season\r\naveraged full three quarts per day less than the first, and, at the same\r\ntime, the quality of the milk was deteriorated in the same proportion as\r\nthe quantity.\r\n\r\nThis was my first lesson, acquired by experience. At the same time, I\r\nlearned another by observation. The two combined added materially to my\r\nstock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nA neighbor of mine, a German, in the month of January, 1849, purchased\r\na heifer, three years of age the coming spring. She had been kept poor\r\nfrom the time she was weaned. At two years of age she had dropped her\r\nfirst calf, and through her first season of milk had given but little\r\npromise as a milker. She had just been dried when he purchased her, and\r\nhe, without any previous knowledge of the care of cows, commenced feeding\r\nher according to his instincts. He fed her six quarts of meal per day, in\r\naddition to all the hay she would eat. This system of feeding continued\r\nuntil about the twenty-fifth of March, when she calved. At the time of\r\ncalving she was in better condition than much of the beef sold in our\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that his cow calved I repurchased mine. The feed of\r\nthe two, thereafter, was very nearly alike, except that his cow had a\r\nfeed of six quarts of meal per day, while mine had only two. His fat cow\r\ndoubled on the quantity of milk that she had given the year before, when\r\nshe came in poor, while my poor cow, with extra feed, fell short more\r\nthan a third of her yield of the year before, when she came in, in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAt that time I do not remember to have ever seen a work on chemistry, and\r\nknew nothing of its application; but the knowledge acquired, led to the\r\nformation of a theory in my mind, on which I have since acted, and which,\r\nI believe, has a scientific basis, to wit: “The fat laid on the body of\r\nan in-calf cow, is a store from which nature draws a large portion of the\r\nmaterial which increases and enriches the subsequent flow of milk—a store\r\nfrom which she, by legitimate processes, produces oleo-stearine in the\r\nshape of butter.”\r\n\r\nActing upon this theory, I have endeavored to apportion to my cows a\r\nuniform daily ration, occasionally varying the material, which, although\r\nit may not sustain the cow in full flesh during the greatest flow of\r\nmilk, seems to renew it during the period of the lesser flow, and render\r\nthem in good condition at the time of calving. This system of uniform\r\nfeeding, to my mind, pays better than it does to feed heavily while in\r\nmilk, and then lightly when dry, because it furnishes a large resource\r\nof fat, on which to draw at a time when to consume sufficient food to\r\nsustain the entire flow of milk capable of being produced, might imperil\r\nhealth; and I feel quite sure that a certain richness is thereby imparted\r\nto the milk, that no amount of feeding will draw from a poor cow. In the\r\nautumn of 1877 I purchased a grade heifer reputed to be seven-eighths\r\nJersey and one-eighth Ayrshire. She had dropped her first calf the spring\r\nprevious, when only two years old. She was then represented as yielding\r\nthree quarts of milk per day, and due to calve April the sixth. To\r\naccount for the small yield of milk, her owner said she had been kept on\r\npoor pasture and milked by careless boys, who had not been particular to\r\nmilk her clean.\r\n\r\nThat she had been kept on poor pasture her appearance abundantly\r\nconfirmed. She came into my possession during the root harvest, in\r\nNovember. I commenced by feeding to her three bushels of rutabaga tops,\r\nor of beet tops, three pounds of corn meal, together with all the dry hay\r\nshe would eat each day.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE YEAR’S EXPENSES AND RETURNS.\r\n\r\nThe cost of keeping the cow from November first, 1877, to June first,\r\n1878, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     150 pounds of Indian Meal, at $1.40  $ 2.10\r\n     380   ”    Ship Stuff, at $1.35        5.13\r\n     110   ”    Oil Meal, at $1.30          1.82\r\n    4140   ”    Roots, at $8.00 per ton    16.56\r\n    3392   ”    Hay, at $20                33.92\r\n       1 peck Salt                          0.25\r\n                                          ------\r\n                                          $59.78\r\n\r\nThe cost from June first to November first, 1878, was as follows:\r\n\r\n    1530 pounds of Hay, at $20     $15.30\r\n     225   ”    Oil meal, at $1.30   2.92\r\n     470   ”    Bran, at $1.35       6.35\r\n    Salt                             0.25\r\n    Service                          2.00\r\n                                    ----- $26.82\r\n                                          ------\r\n    Making a total cost of                $86.60\r\n\r\nfor the year, counting nothing for the garden truck consumed during the\r\nsummer and autumn. This, with the exception of the corn stalks, would\r\nhave been consigned to the compost heap, had she not eaten it, so that\r\nits only value to me was its value for compost. But allowing that for the\r\npurpose of feed it was equal in value to its equivalent in hay, and that\r\nmy winter ration of hay had been continued through the year, her total\r\ncost of keeping would have been, in round numbers, one hundred and four\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIn the roots fed to her during the winter, were included the waste\r\nand parings of vegetables used in a family of ten persons, which was\r\nsometimes no inconsiderable item. These were always thrown into the feed\r\nbasket, and just enough fresh roots sliced to make the required weight.\r\nAfter the roots stored in the cellar were exhausted no account was made\r\nof this item. I make this statement simply to show that every item of\r\nfeed was entered at its full value, into the cost of the keeping.\r\n\r\nNow for the other side. Although the cow was quite thin when I bought\r\nher, yet under this system of care and feeding, she was estimated to\r\nhave gained two hundred pounds in weight by the time she calved, on the\r\nfifteenth of April, 1878, and of this weight she had not lost more than\r\nseventy-five pounds at the end of the year, November first. When I bought\r\nher she was represented as yielding three quarts of milk per day. Her\r\nyield of milk weighed on the first day exactly five and three-quarter\r\npounds. At the end of three weeks, it had increased to eleven pounds\r\nper day, and continued at this figure with scarcely any interruption\r\nuntil the first of February. It then rapidly fell off, until by the\r\ntwenty-fifth of that month, she yielded only seven pounds per day. I then\r\ncommenced milking her once a day, and the milking on the fourth day after\r\nweighed only four and a half pounds. I continued milking her until the\r\nfifteenth of March, when I stopped, the weight of the last milking being\r\nonly one and three-quarter pounds. On the tenth or April she calved. I\r\nlet her calf suckle her until it was four weeks old, when it was sold\r\nfor veal. On the seventh of May her yield of milk was twenty-two pounds.\r\nIt averaged about that figure until she got a full feed of pea vines in\r\nJune, when it ran up as high as twenty-seven pounds. In July it fell off\r\nsome, and continued to run from twenty to twenty-three pounds until the\r\nmiddle of August. It then gradually diminished to the first of November,\r\nat which time she was yielding thirteen pounds of milk per day. I find,\r\nby referring to my diary, that her total yield of milk from the time I\r\npurchased her until she calved, was one thousand and sixty-seven pounds,\r\nequal to four hundred and eighty-four quarts, reckoning thirty-four\r\nounces to the quart. Milk was then selling, in this vicinity, at six\r\ncents per quart, making a value of twenty-six dollars and four cents.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she calved until the first of November, her total yield of\r\nmilk was three thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven pounds, equal\r\nto one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven quarts, at five cents,\r\neighty-eight dollars and eighty-five cents; sale of calf, six dollars and\r\nfifty-cents; making a net profit of seventeen dollars and thirty-nine\r\ncents, to say nothing of the growth of the cow, or the value of her\r\nmanure, which was an ample compensation for the care of keeping.\r\n\r\nHad I estimated the value of her milk at the retail price, I should add\r\none cent per quart for summer, and two cents per quart for winter. The\r\nnext year this same cow, with the increase of the equivalent of one and\r\na half pounds of meal per day, to allow for her increased growth, and a\r\nslight deviation in the matter of feed during the summer, whereby she\r\nobtained more green food, of which I shall speak hereafter, increased her\r\nprofit almost forty per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARGET.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I am very careful, and that is, not to allow the inflowing\r\nmilk, previous to calving, to harden in the udder, and in all my long\r\nexperience, in owning cows, I have never had a case of garget. When I was\r\na boy about twelve years of age, my father purchased a very large milker\r\nfor those days. I noticed that the right hind quarter of her udder was\r\nmuch smaller than the other, and yielded a correspondingly less quantity\r\nof milk. After she had been dried off, and the time approached for her to\r\ncalve, I observed that this same quarter of her udder became very much\r\nmore distended than the others. Her whole udder was very much distended,\r\nbut this quarter excessively so. As her period of calving was delayed,\r\nand her udder became more inflamed, producing, evidently, great pain to\r\nthe cow, I asked the privilege of milking her, and was denied. At the\r\nsame time I was given to understand that it was the worst possible thing\r\nthat could be done for the cow; that it was necessary that her udder\r\nshould become thus distended, in order to give it the capacity to contain\r\nthe flow of milk after calving; that should she be milked before calving,\r\nthe yield after calving would be very much lessened, etc. By the time she\r\ncalved, her udder was one indurated mass, and that particular quarter of\r\nit so much inflamed that she could not bear to have the calf touch it.\r\nIn the course of time, however, by copious applications of cold water,\r\nand various liniments, the inflammation was reduced, but that particular\r\nsection of the udder, which had been sufficiently distended to hold\r\nher whole yield, was shrunken to its old dimensions, and was no larger\r\nthan when I first saw her. When the time approached for her to drop her\r\nnext calf, I took the responsibility of clandestinely milking her, so\r\nthat when she calved there was no inflamed udder, there was no fussing\r\nwith liniments. Its four quarters were now evenly developed; the only\r\ndifference was the former shrunken quarter was larger, if anything, than\r\nthe others, and, throughout the season, the yield of milk, from the same\r\nkeeping, was essentially increased over the yield of the previous year. I\r\nnever disclosed the secret, however, until I was grown up. But I acquired\r\na very useful lesson which I applied in my practice long before the\r\ntheory that it was best to milk a cow previous to calving was generally\r\nadopted by owners around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETHERING.\r\n\r\nA professional friend of mine is the owner of three horses and two\r\nimported cows, all of which are kept in very high condition. He informs\r\nme that for several years, with the exception of one year, two and one\r\nhalf acres of land have furnished all the hay consumed by the five\r\nanimals, together with pasturage for one cow; the other cow being dry\r\nduring the summer, is pastured in the country. His land is naturally\r\ngood grass land, being moist, well drained, and perfectly smooth. The\r\napparatus for tethering his cow, when at pasture, consists of a pole or\r\njoist, the short end of which is weighted, swiveled on an iron upright,\r\nstanding, when in position, about four feet above the ground, giving the\r\napparatus the appearance of a model of an old-fashioned well sweep. The\r\nhalter being attached to the upper end, is always above her back while\r\nfeeding. This arrangement allows the cow the range of a circuit thirty\r\nfeet in diameter. The upright is removed to the arc of the circle at\r\nmorning and noon. In this manner she traverses the length of the lot,\r\nfour hundred feet, in fourteen days, when she is brought back to the\r\nstarting point, to repeat the journey again. In this manner, twelve\r\nthousand feet of land is made to furnish pasturage for one cow during\r\nthe entire summer, and besides this, she has no feed whatever. The cow\r\nis always in good condition, and the ground never appears very closely\r\ncropped, and I have no doubt that were she restricted to one quarter of\r\nan acre, or ten thousand eight hundred and ninety feet, she would still\r\nbe better fed than most cows that are at pasture. The droppings of the\r\ncow are daily removed from this range, so that she always has a clean\r\nfeeding ground. All the manure made by the five animals is annually\r\nreturned to this lot, and, in addition, the owner informs me, once in\r\nthree years he gives it a dressing of a ton of ground bone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARL MILLET.\r\n\r\nAfter reading of Mr. Peter Henderson’s experiment with Pearl Millet, as\r\ndescribed in the “American Agriculturist,” I determined to make a trial\r\nwith it myself. Accordingly, last year, I sowed an area of eighteen\r\nsquare rods with it, in drills, fourteen inches apart; six rods were set\r\napart to be cut and dried for fodder. The product of the other twelve\r\nrods was fed green. On the twentieth of June, a month after sowing, the\r\ngrowth measured about three feet in hight. On this date we commenced\r\ncutting it, and feeding to the cow all she would eat. She ate it with a\r\ngreater apparent relish than any other green feed that had been given\r\nher. The cutting was finished on the twenty-fifth of July, on which\r\nday the last cutting measured about four feet in hight. The second\r\ncutting was commenced on the twenty-seventh of July, and finished on the\r\ntwenty-second of August, the growth averaging nearly three and a half\r\nfeet. The third cutting was commenced on the twenty-third and finished\r\non the thirty-first of August. The growth was about two feet at the\r\nbeginning of the cutting, but not more than ten inches at the finish. The\r\nfourth and last cutting was commenced on the sixteenth, and finished on\r\nthe twenty-first of September, after which the ground appeared exhausted,\r\nand no further growth was made. The twelve rods cut and fed green yielded\r\nfeed sufficient for seventy-five days, aside from her usual ration of\r\nbran or oil meal, while the product from the six rods, cut and fed dry,\r\nonly two cuttings being made, was sufficient to feed her for thirty-four\r\ndays, making a total feed for one hundred and nine days, from eighteen\r\nrods of ground; at which rate it would require sixty and one-quarter rods\r\nof ground to furnish forage for a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT COMPOST.\r\n\r\nThe only stable manure I use on my crops is that made by my cow. All my\r\nother fertilizers are artificially produced. In the course of the year,\r\nin prosecuting my regular business, I render some two hundred thousand\r\npounds of tallow. This is all done by boiling it with sulphuric acid.\r\nThe acid attacks and decomposes the animal tissue, leaving the rendered\r\ntallow floating on its surface. A part of the dissolved animal tissue,\r\ntogether with the bones that are sometimes smuggled in with the rough\r\nfat, settles to the bottom of the tanks, and a part remains dissolved\r\nin the acid. This spent acid, together with the deposit in the bottom\r\nof the tanks, is the source of all my nitrogen, except what may be in\r\nthe manure from the cow, as well as a portion of my phosphorous. I have\r\noccasion to use considerable of the potash of commerce in some of my\r\nmanufactures. For my land, I make of this a saturated solution, and then\r\ndry it, by stirring into it a mixture of equal parts of ground plaster\r\nand sifted coal ashes. This, in a few days, becomes sulphate of potash,\r\nlime, and coal ashes, at least I judge that it does, for it loses all its\r\ncausticity.\r\n\r\nIn preparing my fertilizers, I mix the product of my tanks with loam,\r\nnear the place to be planted; this, in the spring, is dug over and mixed\r\nwith the manure from the stable. The effect of this mixing is to make\r\nthe manure very fine in a very short time. After plowing, this compost\r\nis spread upon the land, and harrowed in. I then follow with ground\r\nbone, which costs me, delivered at my place, bolted, twenty-five dollars\r\nper ton, at the rate of twelve hundred pounds to the acre, and with the\r\npotash mixture, at the rate of two hundred and forty pounds to the acre,\r\nwhich is also harrowed in. In distributing the potash, I distribute more\r\nof it where I intend to plant peas or potatoes, and less where I intend\r\nto plant corn, squashes, and turnips. In distributing the bone, I reverse\r\nthis. It is on a light, sandy loam, fertilized in this manner, with an\r\nexcess of nitrogen, no doubt, that I expect, the coming summer, to raise\r\nenough feed for a cow on less than half an acre of ground. The land on\r\nwhich my experiment was tried last year was a turned sod that had had no\r\nmanure of any kind for more than ten years. This year it will be tried on\r\nland that was manured as above last year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WOMAN’S SUCCESS AND EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. MARY L. TAYLOR, NORTH VERNON, INDIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy success in keeping the family cow is mainly due to the superior sense\r\nof that animal in coming into being in a latitude where a cow can live\r\nwith as little care and protection, and where the face of unplowed and\r\nunharrowed nature furnishes as much food for her as any other; latitude\r\nthirty-nine.\r\n\r\nMy cow is a scrub—cost twenty dollars; had her calf on the fourteenth of\r\nFebruary, 1879, and we complimented the saint on whose day she came by\r\ncalling her Valentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WE MANAGED THE CALF.\r\n\r\nI put the calf in a pen made in the fence corner and covered with a few\r\nold boards, and let the cow in to her every night—first taking from the\r\ncow what milk we needed for our family of four persons. I left her with\r\nthe calf all night, and in the morning milked what the calf had left for\r\nme. This was not much after the first two weeks, and after two more weeks\r\nI only wasted my time at milking in the morning. I parted with the calf\r\nat three months old for eight dollars, and laid this sum by as my capital\r\nto draw against for the cow’s winter keeping.\r\n\r\nMy farm is half an acre in extent, and all of it, except the space\r\noccupied by the cottage and a small garden, is lawn, and is well set in\r\nBlue-grass, with a sprinkling of Orchard-grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nI sold my lawn mower and put a short rope around my cow’s horns. To\r\nthis I fastened the chain of an old chain-pump. The pump had served its\r\nday, and was now laid aside. This old pump-chain was about sixteen feet\r\nlong, and through the end of it I stuck an old iron garden stake into\r\nthe ground, and staked my cow out on the lawn. In the chain I put rings\r\none yard apart, and by running my garden stake through a ring nearer or\r\nfarther from the rope around the cow’s horns, I could give her a larger\r\nor smaller circle to graze on, and so let her eat very near to evergreens\r\nand other shrubbery without danger of having them injured. She pulled up\r\nthe stake several times at first, but the remedy for this came of itself.\r\nIn my desire to make her very secure, I had tied the rope around her\r\nhorns too tightly and made her head sore. She ceased pulling, and though\r\nher head soon got well, she has never since pulled up the stake; so that\r\nmy mistake in fastening the rope, though it caused me self-reproaches at\r\nthe time, really proved a blessing in the end, for had she formed the\r\nhabit of pulling the stake up, I should have been forced to discontinue\r\nstaking her out for fear of her destroying the shrubbery. My cow seems\r\nto have a spite at shrubbery proportioned to its beauty, and this spite\r\nseems intensified against such plants as she cannot eat. A young cedar,\r\nfor instance, she will never pass without trying to demolish it with her\r\nhorns. By means of the rings in my chain, I could stake her so that she\r\ncould eat up to the edge of an evergreen without being able to touch it\r\nwith her horns, and I found the horns the only part that the shrubbery\r\nhad to fear, for she never yet has tried to destroy anything with her\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nMy lawn, under the care of this new one-cow lawn-mower, became the\r\nadmiration and envy of the whole neighborhood. The chickens followed her\r\nand scattered her droppings, so that the lawn was always clean. I found\r\nit a great improvement on the old hand lawn-mower, and much less labor,\r\nfor the staking out was far less trouble than running the mower. Besides,\r\nI sold the old machine for almost half the price I paid for the cow. But,\r\nstrange as it seems to me now, I at first felt a little ashamed of my new\r\nmower, for I got in the practice of staking the cow on the front lawn at\r\nnight, and moving her to the back lawn early in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe did her work so silently in the darkness that my neighbors wondered\r\nmuch that in so well-kept a lawn they never heard the click of the\r\nlawn-mower.\r\n\r\nWe have no storms in the summer in this latitude from which a cow needs\r\nany more protection than a tree affords. When it rained I milked her\r\nunder the shelter of a beech.\r\n\r\nIn June, I rented a one-quarter acre lot for two dollars, and for one\r\ndollar hired it plowed and laid off in furrows a little over two feet\r\napart. In these furrows I dropped corn, the grains two to four inches\r\napart. I hired it plowed once with a shovel plow. This cost seventy-five\r\ncents. At the first frost, I had it cut and put up in small shocks. A\r\nwoman that does washing for me, and occasionally chores about the house,\r\ndid this at forty cents a day. She was several days at it, but during\r\nthe time performed other work about the house. I think she spent about\r\ntwo solid days on it. This corn-fodder, with few large ears on it, but a\r\ngreat many nubbins, made my fodder and grain for the cow for the winter.\r\nLater in the fall, when the corn-stalks were thoroughly cured, I had\r\nthem placed against poles set on crotches around the place where the\r\ncow was sheltered during the winter. The stalks were leaned against the\r\npoles from both sides, and made a sloping roof both ways, so as to shed\r\nsnow and rain. From these poles I gave the cow an armful of this corn\r\nand fodder night and morning, and though the snow did sometimes lodge on\r\nthem, and make my mittens cold, I could generally find a spot on one side\r\nor the other that was clear of snow. This work of putting up the fodder\r\nfor winter use cost about two dollars.\r\n\r\nMy cow had been used to “slops” and meal, and did not take kindly to\r\nwhole corn at first. I was advised to husk the corn, and get it ground;\r\nbut by feeding her a few small or broken, or soft ears from my hand, she\r\nsoon became eager for it, and has learned to grind it as well as the\r\nmill, and at less cost of going to and from, to say nothing of the toll.\r\nBut even if she was not as good a corn crusher as the mill-stones, there\r\nwould be no loss, for my fowls follow her faithfully, and pick up every\r\nbroken grain that is dropped; so the miller’s toll that I save keeps me\r\nin chickens and eggs. Now that the cow had come to eat whole corn, I was\r\ntold that she would muss over the fodder, hunting for the nubbins, and\r\nwaste the stalks; but by sprinkling a little brine on the stalks when\r\nshe became dainty, I found I could make her eat them as closely as was\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WINTER SHELTER.\r\n\r\nI had no stable. The cow stood out in all the storms until late in\r\nDecember. The hair grew very thick, almost like a buffalo robe, and she\r\ndid not seem to mind the cold. There was an old chicken house on the\r\nplace, standing on posts about five feet high. It was in a hollow, and\r\nwas sheltered by evergreens on the north and west. As I pulled up her\r\nstake one night in a drizzle to let her go under the tree where I milked\r\nher, she started on the gallop for this house, and from that time it was\r\nher winter couch. There I milked and fed her. I tied the chain around one\r\nof the corner posts, so as to leave her the choice of the shelter of the\r\nbuilding or of exposure to the storm at her discretion, and I must say\r\nthat she often surprised me by seeming as fond as a child of standing\r\nout in the rain. Under this coop I fed her fodder; the stalks she left,\r\nlittered down her bed, and I had more manure in the spring than I had\r\never had before. A boy spread it from a wheelbarrow at twenty-five cents\r\na day. The spring before I paid fifty cents a load for the manure, and\r\ntwo dollars and fifty cents a day for the hauling.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SALTING.\r\n\r\nI never fed the cow any salt for health during the summer, but she kept\r\nhealthy, and the butter came. In the fall, I began feeding her the house\r\nslops, night and morning, and when she did not eat them freely I put a\r\nlittle salt in. When I thought she was not eating her fodder up clean\r\nenough, I would sprinkle on a little brine with an old broom. I never fed\r\nsalt for her good, but sometimes for mine. In the fall, when I wanted her\r\nto eat up weeds before they went to seed, I used occasionally to sprinkle\r\nwith brine such spots as I wanted eaten off closely. I never could make\r\nmy old lawn-mower cut off weeds any closer than grass, but this new\r\nlawn-mower would eat these weed patches to the collars of the roots.\r\n\r\nMy cow became used to this kind of life, makes me no trouble, has\r\nfurnished the milk and butter for our family of four the whole year, and\r\nsome butter to send to my friends, and a little to sell. I have fodder\r\nenough from my quarter acre to keep her until grass is abundant, and have\r\none dollar and twenty cents of the price of my calf still on hand.\r\n\r\nI might go on and tell you how I used to buy hay at a high price for\r\nwintering my cow, and quantities of bran, brewers’ grains and corn-meal;\r\nhow the hay always made her costive and hide-bound, and how she never\r\nate it with half the relish which she does the corn fodder; how I found\r\nit an unladylike act to raise my foot and force the garden stake into\r\nthe ground, and so contrived a smaller iron that I could more gracefully\r\nplant, and that no unruly cow ever could pull up; how with this new stake\r\nI can safely leave her on the lawn all night with the fullest confidence\r\nof finding her in the morning just where I left her, how when at first\r\nthe cow got loose and wandered to the garden, I discovered that the taste\r\nof the butter was disagreeably affected by her eating certain herbs, and\r\nhow it was very pleasantly flavored by others; how I am cultivating these\r\nherbs to make the sweetest and most golden butter; how—but dear me! for a\r\none-cow story it is already too long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—THE JERSEY COW “ABBIE.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERDRAINING AND CARE OF MANURE.\r\n\r\nBY H. H. HALL, NEW ORLEANS, LA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us locate one acre of land on the thirty-eighth degree of north\r\nlatitude, midway across the continent, say near the City of St. Louis.\r\nWhile under the intensive system of cultivation which will be pursued,\r\nless land than one acre will ultimately be found sufficient to supply\r\nthe wants of one cow, it would not be advisable to begin with a less\r\nquantity. That one acre is sufficient is opposed to the general opinion,\r\nas witness the assertion of Mr. Schull, of Little Falls, N. Y., that\r\nthe land in pasturage and hay, requisite for the support of one cow,\r\nis three acres, and this accords with the estimate of Mr. Carrington\r\nfor moderately good dairy farms in England. Colman says: Three acres\r\nare required for a cow in Berkshire Co., Mass. Mr. Farrington, in the\r\nReport of the American Dairymen’s Association says, four; while Mr. X. A.\r\nWillard thinks that in Herkimer Co., N. Y., one and a half to two acres\r\nwill pasture one cow, and that in some exceptional cases one acre will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that these estimates take into consideration grass and hay\r\nsolely, and the treatment of the land is presumed to be that usually\r\npursued, viz.: scant allowance of manure, absence of subsoil drainage,\r\nand consequently shallow cultivation.\r\n\r\nBut high manuring and deep cultivation are indispensable in view, viz.:\r\nthe obtaining the greatest quantity of dairy food from the least land.\r\nAnd high cultivation, implying depth of soil, tilth, porosity and\r\naeration is impossible without subsoil drainage; nor in its absence does\r\nmanure produce its best effects. It is foreign to the purpose of this\r\narticle to elucidate the action of tile draining upon crops and soil.\r\nThe lasting and great benefit of the system is, to-day, a matter of such\r\nplain fact, that no intelligent agriculturist will question it.\r\n\r\nTherefore we begin by selecting an acre of land which affords the best\r\nfacilities for laying tile-drainage pipes. An easy slope with a good,\r\nopen outlet into ditch, run, or gulch, is all that is required. The\r\nadvantages of a sunny exposure are so obvious that, if possible, we\r\nshould choose land which trends to the south and east. The tile-draining\r\nof one acre will necessitate an outlay of about twenty-five dollars; but\r\nthis expenditure is indispensable to the obtaining of the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUNG HEAP.\r\n\r\nTruly did the German agriculturist, Schwerz, in seeing the fertile\r\nstreamlets oozing and trickling away from the exposed manure piles of\r\nhis opinionated countrymen, denominate the dung heap the “Fountainhead\r\nof Benediction.” This, like other blessings, may but too readily be\r\nperverted in its uses.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the necessity of husbanding every part and portion of this\r\nsubstratum of good agriculture, we choose between two distinct methods\r\nof saving and utilizing the fluid and solid _dejecta_, viz.: the dry and\r\nwet. In the former the _dejecta_ are commingled with such absorbents as\r\ndry earth, leaves, straw, sawdust, etc.; in the latter, they are received\r\nin a tank where they are mixed with sufficient water to stay loss by too\r\nrapid fermentation. The application of the manure under either method is\r\nrespectively in its dry or in its liquid condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—A COW STABLE WITH MANURE CELLAR.]\r\n\r\nIf the dry or absorbent method be adopted, it will be found advantageous\r\nto locate the stable on a little declivity, so as to secure a manure\r\ncellar with the least excavation.\r\n\r\nThus, in fig. 24, _C_ represents a manure cellar under the cow, with a\r\ndoor at _K_ for removal of manure. The floor and walls, to a hight of\r\ntwo feet, of this cellar should be cemented. The floor, on which the cow\r\nstands, should be of two-inch oak plank, with a gutter behind, and a trap\r\nto empty the contents of the gutter into the cellar. On level tracts\r\nof ground the Flemish stable, as used in parts of the Brabant, and as\r\ndescribed in the following plan fig. 25, by Felix Villeroy (Manuel de\r\nl’Eleveur de Bètes, â Comes, 6 Ed., p. 63), could be advantageously used\r\nfor one cow. In figure 25, _A_ is the place where the cow stands; _B_,\r\nPassage for distributing food, etc.; _C_, Depression where the manure is\r\nallowed to accumulate behind the cow; _D_, Cellar for roots; _E_, Hay\r\nloft.\r\n\r\nIn this plan the floor _A_ and _C_ would require to be finished in brick\r\nand cement, or concrete.\r\n\r\nThe warmth of the stable might, at times, develop a too rapid\r\nfermentation of the manure. This would be checked by working the pile and\r\nby forking it over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—SECTIONAL VIEW OF STABLE.]\r\n\r\nBut to secure perfect cleanliness, purity of air, and freedom of the\r\nhay stored above from the odors of fermentation going on in the dung\r\nheap, the manure would be better placed outside of the stable walls, as\r\nsuggested in figure 26 (see next page).\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the manure bin is only twenty-four inches below the\r\nsurface, as on level ground the labor of raising the manure from a deep\r\ncellar would be disproportionate to the advantages of the depth. The\r\nfloor of the stall should be laid in brick and cement, or in concrete,\r\nas should be the floor and lower walls of the manure bin. The floor\r\nof the stall should be kept covered with dry earth, leaves, sawdust,\r\nor spent tan-bark; and the bottom of the bin should be covered to the\r\ndepth of several inches, with similar absorbents. In the absence of\r\nthese to-be-preferred materials, weeds, straw, or other dry vegetable\r\nrefuse, may be used. With the gutter sufficiently inclined, the excessive\r\nurine will of itself flow readily to the bin; the solid matter should\r\nbe removed twice daily, just before the cow is milked. The gutter\r\nshould be washed down with a pail of water daily, and sprinkled with\r\ngypsum (sulphate of lime). The manure pile, as it increases, should be\r\nconstantly commingled with fresh absorbents. This is most readily and\r\neconomically done by baiting a pig with a handful of maize cast on the\r\nmanure in the bin. The lusty porker will go to the bottom of the pile,\r\nif need be, for each grain, and by his energetic rooting and trampling,\r\nwill daily incorporate the materials in the most thorough manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—PLAN OF STABLE WITH CISTERN AND MANURE BIN.]\r\n\r\nOn page 260 of Boussingault’s Rural Economy (Law’s translation) are some\r\nvery urgent warnings against the frequent turning of dung heaps. His\r\nobjection, Mr. Law thinks, should be limited to more than three turnings\r\nof the dung. But this objection and limitation apply to horse manure, the\r\nmore active fermentation of which rapidly develops the highly volatile\r\nsalt known as carbonate of ammonia. There can hardly be too thorough a\r\nworking together of cow-manure, with its organic absorbents, particularly\r\nwhen the working is accompanied by the compacting tread of animals.\r\n\r\nThe pile should be watched, and the slightest perception of the pungent\r\nammoniacal odor should be the signal for more absorbents, bearing in mind\r\nthat all organic matter thus composted becomes a valuable fertilizer,\r\nand remembering that nothing should be left undone to increase to the\r\ngreatest extent possible the source of your anticipated blessings.\r\n\r\nThe manure bin should, of course, be so covered as to exclude rain and\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nIf the liquid or dilute method be employed, in place of the manure bin in\r\nthe plan, it will be necessary to construct an underground cemented tank\r\nor cistern, say of a depth of eight feet and diameter of six to seven\r\nfeet at the bottom. This tank must be provided with a pump for raising\r\nthe fluid, the tube of which should terminate in a strainer at about\r\ntwelve inches from the bottom of the tank. An opening should be left in\r\nthe top of the cistern for inspection, and for the insertion of a proper\r\nimplement to stir the sediment. The pump should rise sufficiently high to\r\npermit the pumping of the fluid directly into a tank on wheels used for\r\nthe distribution thereof in the fields. A condemned watering cart, which\r\ncould probably be purchased cheaply, would be an excellent instrument for\r\nthis distribution. Sulphate of iron, green vitriol, should be freely used\r\nto change the carbonate of ammonia into the sulphate, thereby obtaining a\r\nfixed, instead of a highly volatile salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING A COW IN A VILLAGE STABLE.\r\n\r\nBY ORANGE JUDD, FLUSHING, L. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nA business man of New York, living in one of the neighboring villages,\r\nbeing troubled to get good milk for young children in his family, took\r\nour advice the latter part of the winter and, so to speak, went into the\r\ndairy business on his own account. The result will be instructive to\r\ntens of thousands of families in cities and villages. He has no pasture\r\ngrounds, the only convenience being a roomy stall in a carriage barn,\r\nwith opportunity for the cow to sun herself and take limited exercise in\r\na small area, say fifteen by twenty feet, at the side of the barn, and\r\nthis was seldom used. The stall is kept clean and neat, with fresh straw\r\nlitter, and the cow has remained in excellent health and vigor. Chewing\r\nher cud and manufacturing milk seem to give all the exercise needed. Her\r\nfeed has been bale hay, cut in a small hay-cutter, and mixed wet with\r\ncorn-meal, bran, and shorts, with some uncooked potato parings, cabbage\r\nleaves, left over rice, oatmeal, etc., from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nA laborer is paid one dollar a week to milk and feed and brush her night\r\nand morning, and take care of the stable, and he is allowed any excess\r\nof milk she gives over twelve quarts a day. He prepares a mess for her\r\nnoon feed, which is given by one of the boys at school when he comes\r\nhome to lunch. The cow is a grade, probably three-fourths Jersey and\r\none-fourth common blood. Her milk is rich, yields abundant cream, and, as\r\nthe owner’s family say, “Is worth fully double any milk we ever got from\r\nthe best milk dealers.” One neighboring family gladly takes six quarts\r\na day at seven cents a quart, and would willingly pay much more if it\r\nwere asked, and other families would be happy to get some of it at ten\r\ncents a quart; but six quarts are kept for home use, and it is valued far\r\nabove seven cents a quart, and worth more than that amount in the saving\r\nof butter in cooking, making puddings, etc. So it is a very low estimate\r\nto call the whole milk worth seven cents a quart. No one could deprive\r\nour business friend or his family of their good, home produced milk, if\r\nit cost ten or twelve cents a quart. An accurate account is kept of the\r\nfeed; the man in charge orders at the feed store anything he desires for\r\nthe cow, and it is all down on a “pass-book.” Here are the figures for\r\none hundred days past:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COW’S DEBIT AND CREDIT FOR ONE HUNDRED DAYS.\r\n\r\n                               _Dr._\r\n\r\n      850 lbs. bale Hay, at $22 per ton                    $9.35\r\n    1,000 lbs. Corn Meal, at $1.35 per 100 lbs             13.50\r\n      400 lbs. Bran, at $1.30 per 100 lbs                   5.20\r\n      200 lbs. Fine Feed, “Shorts,” at $1.55 per 100 lbs    3.10\r\n       20 bundles of bedding Straw, at 10c.                 2.00\r\n          Paid man for care and milking, $1 per week       14.30\r\n                                                          ------\r\n               Total expenses for 100 days                $47.45\r\n\r\n                               _Cr._\r\n\r\n    1,200 Quarts of best milk (12 quarts per day) at 7c.  $84.00\r\n                                                          ------\r\n               Money profit in 100 days                   $36.55\r\n\r\nOr, to put it in another way, the six hundred quarts sold actually\r\nbrought in forty-two dollars cash, and the entire six hundred quarts\r\nused at home cost five dollars and forty-five cents. The cow cost, say,\r\nsixty-five dollars. The entire care, which was not paid in the surplus\r\nof milk above twelve quarts per day, is charged in the expenses above.\r\nThe manure produced, if sold, would more than meet interest on the cost\r\nof cow, and any depreciation in value by increasing age. Allow the above\r\naverage to be kept up only two hundred days in a year, and at the end of\r\nthat time suppose the cow is sold for half price (thirty-two dollars and\r\nfifty cents), and a fresh one substituted, there would still be a gain\r\nof forty dollars and sixty cents for two hundred days, or for a year a\r\nprofit of seventy-four dollars and ten cents.\r\n\r\nWith good feed the sixty-five dollar cow will keep up a full supply of\r\nmilk at least twenty-six weeks, and then be worth forty dollars for\r\ncontinued milking and breeding. Sell her then and buy another fresh\r\ncow for sixty-five dollars—a loss of fifty dollars a year. The above\r\nliberal allowance of forty-seven dollars and forty-five cents for feed\r\nand care one hundred days, amounts to one hundred and seventy-three\r\ndollars and nineteen cents a year. Adding the loss of fifty dollars for\r\npurchasing two fresh cows, makes the total annual expense two hundred\r\nand twenty-three dollars and nineteen cents. This would make the supply\r\nof milk, twelve quarts a day (four thousand three hundred and eighty\r\nquarts), cost about five cents a quart, or not quite fifty-one cents for\r\nten quarts. This is not an exaggerated estimate for a sixty-five dollar\r\ncow, renewed every twenty-six weeks. The feed and care may be very much\r\nless than the above forty-seven dollars and forty-five cents per hundred\r\ndays, by saving all waste foods suitable for a cow, and by securing\r\npasturage seven or eight months, and especially when a cow can be cared\r\nfor by members of the family, thus saving fifty-two dollars a year.\r\nTaking the country as a whole, probably fifty dollars will ordinarily buy\r\na cow that will, on fair feed, average ten to twelve quarts per day for\r\nthe first six months after calving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS OF FAMOUS DAIRY COWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—Jersey Cow “Eurotas,” 2454 (_Frontispiece_), owned by A.
