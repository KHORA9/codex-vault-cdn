The idea of large areas of the state being\r\nnothing more than broad, flat prairies has come about because the major\r\nhighways have been built to take advantage of the comparatively low,\r\ngently rolling landscape rather than the rougher more scenic areas.\r\n\r\nPhysiography is the study of the creation and gradual change of land\r\nsurface forms (the landscape). Thus, the land surface as we see it today\r\nin each of the physiographic provinces (fig. 1) has had a particular\r\nhistory of development.\r\n\r\nIllinois is about 385 miles long from north to south and about 218 miles\r\nwide. It has an area of 55,947 square miles. The average elevation of\r\nthe state is about 600 feet above sea level. Charles Mound, however, in\r\nthe northern part of Jo Daviess County in extreme northwestern Illinois,\r\nhas an elevation of 1,241 feet above sea level and is the highest point\r\nin the state.\r\n\r\nCheap water transportation is available to Illinois industry through\r\nLake Michigan, the Illinois Waterway, and the Mississippi, Ohio, and\r\nWabash Rivers. These major rivers of Illinois collect the surface\r\ndrainage of the state from a network of about 500 streams.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE EARTH MADE OF BENEATH THE GROUND SURFACE?\r\n\r\nThe earth is made of a large number of different rocks and minerals\r\n(limestone, sandstone, shale, coal, iron, granite, and many others).\r\nThese materials are divided into three zones: core, mantle, and crust\r\n(fig. 2).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1—Physiographic provinces of Illinois.]\r\n\r\n  DRIFTLESS AREA\r\n  WISCONSINAN MORAINES\r\n  ILLINOIAN TILL PLAIN\r\n  MISSISSIPPI RIVER\r\n  WABASH RIVER\r\n  SHAWNEE HILLS\r\n  OHIO RIVER\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2—The earth with a segment removed to show\r\n    supposed internal zones.]\r\n\r\n  Crust (6-30 miles)\r\n  Mantle (1800 miles)\r\n  Outer core (1400 miles)\r\n  Inner core (750 miles)\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS CORE?\r\n\r\nThe core is the innermost zone of the earth. It is mainly iron with some\r\nnickel and cobalt. The inner core probably is solid, but the outer core\r\nmay consist of the same elements in a molten form. The core is the most\r\ndense (heaviest) of the three zones.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THE MANTLE DIFFER FROM THE CORE?\r\n\r\nThe mantle, which surrounds the core, is a rigid zone of materials rich\r\nin iron and magnesium. These materials are not as dense as those found\r\nin the core.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE CRUST OF THE EARTH AND HOW IS IT DISTINGUISHED FROM THE\r\nMANTLE AND THE CORE?\r\n\r\nThe crust, the top part of which includes the ground we walk on, is the\r\nhard, outer surface layer of the earth. Although the crust is about 6 to\r\n30 miles deep, the scale (size) of figure 2 allows it to be drawn only\r\nas the thin outer line. The rocks and minerals that we are all\r\nacquainted with are found in the crust. These rocks are not as dense and\r\ndo not have as high an iron content as do the rocks of the mantle and\r\nthe core.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE EARTH’S CRUST UNDER ILLINOIS MADE OF?\r\n\r\nThe earth’s crust under Illinois is made of: sedimentary rocks deposited\r\nby water, wind, or glaciers (limestone, sandstone, shale, glacial\r\ndrift); igneous, or melted rocks (granite, gabbro); and metamorphic, or\r\naltered sedimentary and igneous rocks (quartzite, gneiss). These various\r\ntypes of rocks have a relatively thin covering of broken or weathered\r\nmaterial called mantle rock and soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN AND HOW WAS THE LAND SURFACE OF ILLINOIS FORMED?\r\n\r\nThe ground surface over most of Illinois was formed during the ice age\r\n(Quaternary Period) which lasted from about one million years ago up to\r\nnearly 5,000 years ago. As much as 90 percent of the state was covered\r\nby one of several sheets of glacial ice (fig. 3). The glaciers smoothed\r\ndown and covered much of the old, rocky, hilly land surface and filled\r\nold valleys with loose, unconsolidated deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE DID THE LOOSE, UNCONSOLIDATED DEPOSITS COME FROM AND WHAT ARE THEY\r\nMADE OF?\r\n\r\nIn Canada vast thicknesses of snow and ice accumulated until the weight\r\nof the ice finally caused it to flow slowly outward, mainly to the south\r\n(fig. 4). Rocks and surface materials of all types were picked up and\r\ncarried by the glaciers for great distances before being deposited.\r\nPieces of granite, quartzite, and native copper among the many local\r\nrocks and minerals are found in glacial deposits and indicate that at\r\nleast part of these deposits came from the Great Lakes Region. The\r\nmaterials deposited range from clay-size minerals to large boulders.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3—Extent of the main glacial advances which\r\n    began with the Nebraskan (a—the oldest) and ended with the late\r\n    Wisconsinan (f—the youngest). Diagram “d” shows the major stream\r\n    development during the time between the Illinoian and the earliest\r\n    Wisconsinan glaciers.

Late WISCONSINAN Valparaiso front and Kankakee Flood\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DID ILLINOIS GET ITS SOILS?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4—Limits of ice age glaciers.]\r\n\r\nWeathering and bacterial decay action have modified many of the loose,\r\nunconsolidated surface materials into soils. The present soils of\r\nIllinois are fertile partly because they have minerals and trace\r\nelements (minute amounts of elements such as copper, zinc, manganese)\r\nbrought in by the glaciers from adjacent parts of the country. The\r\nyoungest and most fertile soils occur in the northeastern part of the\r\nstate and along the Illinois and Mississippi River valleys. These young\r\nsoils are more fertile because the glacial deposits and loess\r\n(wind-blown silt) upon which they have developed are younger and\r\nfresher. The minerals and trace elements in these deposits have not been\r\ndissolved out to the extent that they have in the older glacial deposits\r\nand soils in other parts of the state.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5—Woolly mammoth (after C. R. Knight).]\r\n\r\n\r\nARE ANIMAL AND PLANT REMAINS FOUND IN THE GLACIAL DEPOSITS OF ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nScattered mammoth (fig. 5) and mastodon remains have been found in\r\nglacial deposits at various localities in the state. Peat, which is an\r\naccumulation of partially decomposed plant materials, has been found,\r\nespecially in the northern part of the state. It is marketed as an\r\norganic soil conditioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MINERAL WEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WEALTHY IS ILLINOIS IN MINERAL PRODUCTION?\r\n\r\nIn 1963, Illinois mineral production totaled approximately $615,000,000.\r\nThis placed the state first as a mineral producer in the Upper\r\nMississippi Valley and eighth in the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MINERAL COMMODITIES ARE PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nCoal and petroleum, two of the world’s most important mineral resources,\r\nare produced in Illinois. Iron ore, another mineral of extreme\r\nimportance, is brought into the steel mills of the Chicago and East St.\r\nLouis areas from deposits in Minnesota and Missouri. Some ore from\r\nforeign countries is also processed in these mills.\r\n\r\nA great variety of mineral commodities are produced in Illinois. In the\r\norder of their 1963 value (fig. 6) they are (1) crude oil and natural\r\ngas, (2) coal, (3) clay products, (4) crushed stone and cement, (5)\r\ncommon sand and gravel, (6) special sands, (7) fluorspar, and (8)\r\nmetals—zinc and lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY ILLINOIS COUNTIES PRODUCE MINERAL COMMODITIES?\r\n\r\nIn 1963, 99 of the 102 counties of Illinois reported mineral production\r\nof one kind or another.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6—Percentage diagram of Illinois mineral\r\n    production value for 1963.]\r\n\r\n  Petroleum and Natural Gas  36.3%\r\n  Coal  31.9%\r\n  Stone Products  15.2%\r\n  Clay Products  8.8%\r\n  Sand and Gravel  5.9%\r\n  Fluorspar and Metals  1.9%\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY PEOPLE WORK IN THE MINERAL INDUSTRIES OF ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nIn 1963, approximately 27,000 people worked in mines, quarries, oil\r\nfields, and direct processing operations such as cement and clay\r\nproducts plants and oil refineries. Many other persons were employed in\r\ntransporting the materials and in plants and general offices.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THE FARMER IN ILLINOIS BENEFIT FROM MINERAL PRODUCTION?\r\n\r\nThe farmers of the state are among those receiving direct and indirect\r\nbenefits from Illinois minerals. In 1963, more than 4,800,000 tons of\r\nagstone (crushed limestone and dolomite) were spread on Illinois fields\r\nto reduce acidity, maintain soil fertility, and improve crop production.\r\nOther stone and stone products are used in constructing farm buildings\r\nand facilities and in the maintenance of farm-to-market roads. In\r\naddition, petroleum products and coal provide energy to power the\r\nlaborsaving devices that enable the farmer to increase his production\r\nand scale of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PETROLEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS PETROLEUM AND HOW IS IT FORMED?\r\n\r\nPetroleum is a dark, oily fluid that is irregularly distributed in\r\nsedimentary rocks throughout the world. There are several ideas about\r\nthe origin of petroleum. The most widely accepted of these is that\r\nbillions of plants and animals lived and died in widespread seas and\r\ntheir remains decomposed and released fluid, fatty particles. These were\r\ndistilled into “hydrocarbons” (a mixture of the elements hydrogen and\r\ncarbon, such as gas and oil).\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AND WHERE DID OIL COLLECT IN ROCKS?\r\n\r\nThe hydrocarbons, or oil and gas droplets, were buried by countless tons\r\nof sediments that accumulated on ancient sea bottoms. As these sediments\r\nhardened into sedimentary rocks, the hydrocarbons were squeezed into\r\nwhatever empty spaces were available in the rocks. As the layers of\r\nsedimentary rocks later became folded and broken, oil and gas droplets\r\nand salt water moved upward through any interconnecting open spaces.\r\nSome droplets escaped to the surface as “seeps,” but many were trapped\r\nwhen they came up against a nonporous barrier. Gas, being lighter than\r\neither oil or water, was trapped at the top, and oil was stopped in the\r\nmiddle, above the salt water. An accumulation of this kind is termed a\r\n“pool” or a “field.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE DID OIL ACCUMULATE IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nConditions under which oil is found in Illinois (fig. 7) are as follows:\r\n(a) coral reefs, (b) anticlines (upfolds or arches of rock layers), (c)\r\n“pinching” or “lensing” out of dipping, overlapping porous rock layers,\r\nand (d) buried sandstone-filled ancient stream channels.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THERE LAKES OR RIVERS OF OIL UNDERGROUND?\r\n\r\nNo. Oil and gas accumulate in the pores (openings) between silt and sand\r\ngrains and in small openings in limestone and dolomite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7—Places where oil is found in Illinois: (a)\r\n    coral reefs, (b) anticlines, (c) pinch-outs, and (d) channel\r\n    sandstones.]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n  Glacial drift\r\n  Dolomite\r\n  Shale\r\n  Gas saturated zone\r\n  Sandstone\r\n  Oil saturated zone\r\n  Limestone\r\n  Water saturated zone\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS OIL DISCOVERED?\r\n\r\nAlthough prospect (test) drilling is still the only way to prove the\r\npresence or absence of commercial quantities of oil beneath the surface,\r\ncareful study by a geologist of all available information may indicate\r\nthe most favorable places for testing. Since oil and gas migrate to the\r\nhighest parts of the porous rock zones, the geologist tries to find\r\nthese high places even though they may be several hundred feet\r\nunderground. Sometimes dipping rocks can be seen in outcrops, and\r\nseveral geophysical methods have been used to indicate where such high\r\nplaces may occur underground. At other times, high places are found by\r\nstudying with a microscope samples of rocks collected from wells already\r\ndrilled in the surrounding area. The geologist notes the type and order\r\nof the formations which have been drilled. Many holes have been drilled\r\nbased on such information.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the test drilling is successful as a producing well,\r\nsmall samples of cuttings of the rock being drilled are collected and\r\nsaved to be studied at a later time. Various instruments are also put\r\ndown into the hole to record temperatures, pressures, electrical\r\nproperties, and other characteristics of the rocks. This type of\r\ninformation, when carefully plotted on maps, serves to locate new areas\r\nfor test drilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH OIL CAN BE OBTAINED FROM AN OIL POOL?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to tell before a hole is drilled whether or not oil will\r\nbe found, how much oil is present, or what will be the best way to get\r\nit to the surface. Where subsurface pressures are great enough, oil may\r\nflow to the surface.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, about one-third of the oil actually present in the\r\nrocks can be pumped before the well becomes uneconomical to operate.\r\nThis is called primary production. Oil operators have learned that by\r\npumping water or gas down some wells into the oil-bearing formation,\r\nanother third of the oil may be forced out through neighboring wells.\r\nThis is called secondary production. Experiments that use steam or that\r\nburn some of the oil underground in an oil-bearing formation are\r\nattempts to recover the remaining third. These methods using heat are\r\noften referred to as tertiary production methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE “BIGGEST” OIL WELL ON RECORD IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nIllinois’ largest well, near Centralia, flowed 12,000 barrels of oil in\r\na 24-hour period. Most Illinois oil wells, however, have to be pumped,\r\nand the majority of them are now producing 10 barrels or less a day. The\r\ndeepest producing well, 5,354 feet, was drilled in 1960 in Wayne County,\r\nnear Fairfield. In the same year the deepest oil test was drilled to a\r\ndepth of 8,616 feet and was stopped in granite. This test is located in\r\nFayette County near Beecher City and has its oil production from a zone\r\nover 4,000 feet above the bottom of the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH OIL IS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS AND HOW VALUABLE IS IT?\r\n\r\nIn 1963, about 75 million barrels of oil, 2.7 percent of the nation’s\r\ntotal, were produced in Illinois (fig. 8). This oil is valued at over\r\n$221,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS OIL PRODUCTION INCREASING OR DECREASING IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nIn 1940, our state had its highest yield of oil when 147,647,000 barrels\r\nwere produced. Although production figures remained fairly high for some\r\ntime, they have declined in the past few years. Since no new large oil\r\ndiscoveries have been made recently, Illinois’ total known oil reserves\r\nare decreasing yearly. In 1963, Illinois ranked eighth among the\r\noil-producing states, with 420 oil fields consisting of 30,149 wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS COAL AND HOW IS IT FORMED?\r\n\r\nCoal is a combustible rock that was formed by the accumulation and\r\npartial decay of vegetation. When coal was forming millions of years\r\nago, most of the state was a low coastal plain bordered on the west and\r\nsouthwest by a shallow sea. A large variety of plants grew in great\r\nswamps which covered this coastal plain (fig. 9). When the plants died,\r\nthey accumulated in the swamps to form thick masses of peat that were\r\neventually covered by shallow seas and buried beneath mud and sand.\r\nPeriodically, the region was above sea level, new swamps developed, new\r\npeat deposits accumulated, and more sediments were laid down. This\r\nprocess occurred repeatedly until over 3,000 feet of sediments had been\r\ndeposited. Then the sediments were slowly compacted and hardened so that\r\nsandstones, shales, limestones, and coals were formed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8—Estimated total oil production by counties\r\n    from 1888 through 1963.]\r\n\r\n  Counties producing oil in January 1965\r\n  Total Production 2,464,758,000 barrels\r\n  46 counties producing\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9—Reconstruction of coal-forming swamp.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DO WE KNOW THAT COAL WAS DERIVED FROM PLANT MATERIALS?\r\n\r\nAlthough plant impressions or fossilized wood can be seen in coal, they\r\nare more common in shales and sandstones associated with the coal. Often\r\nroots can be seen in the clay that lies just under the coal, and in some\r\nplaces stumps of trees from the coal swamp forest are preserved in the\r\nsediments adjacent to the coal (fig. 10). When pieces of coal are\r\nexamined with a microscope, carbonized plant remains can be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY COAL SEAMS ARE PRESENT IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nThere are at least 40 different coal seams in Illinois, but most are\r\nrelatively thin. Seven coal seams have been mined extensively, and all\r\ntogether 20 or more have been mined.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10—Some root, stem, and leaf fossils found in\r\n    Illinois coal-bearing rocks.]\r\n\r\n  _Neuropteris_ ⅖×\r\n  _Nosopteris stem_ ⅔×\r\n  _Neuropteris_ ½×\r\n  _Lepidodendron_ ⅖×\r\n  _Pecopteris_ ⅔×\r\n  _Stigmaria_ ⅖×\r\n  _Annularia_ ⅔×\r\n  _Spiropteris_ ⅔×\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_ 1×\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS ILLINOIS COAL MINED?\r\n\r\nIn Illinois there are two main ways of mining coal: strip (open-cut) and\r\nunderground. Strip or open-cut mines (fig. 11) usually operate where the\r\ncoal is at very shallow depths, although such mining is done as much as\r\n100 feet deep or more in some places. Many old underground mines\r\nproduced coal from seams that were less than 100 feet deep because they\r\ndid not have the large machinery for strip mining when these mines were\r\nstarted. An abandoned mine, 1,004 feet deep, near Assumption is the\r\ndeepest underground coal mine in the state. Coal is now being mined at\r\ndepths somewhat over 800 feet in Jefferson County.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES ILLINOIS RANK AS A COAL PRODUCER?\r\n\r\nIllinois ranks fourth in production of coal in the United States. It is\r\nexceeded only by West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. Some of the\r\nlargest and most efficient mines in the country are operated in\r\nIllinois. Underground mines in Illinois have the highest rate of tons\r\nmined per man each day in the country, and this rate is increasing.\r\nIncreased mining efficiency has made it possible to hold the price of\r\ncoal low enough so that it can successfully compete against other fuels\r\nfor many uses.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11—Diagram of strip mine showing: (a)\r\n    stripping shovel, and (b) coal-loading shovel.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH COAL IS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS ANNUALLY AND HOW VALUABLE IS IT?\r\n\r\nIn the last 10 years, an average of about 46 million tons of coal has\r\nbeen mined each year (fig. 12). In 1963, approximately 51.6 million tons\r\nwere produced, which were valued at about $196,000,000 at the mine.\r\nSince 1961, strip mines have produced over half of the coal mined in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LONG WILL OUR COAL SUPPLIES LAST?\r\n\r\nIt will take well over 1,000 years at the present rate of mining in\r\nIllinois to exhaust our coal reserves. An estimated 140 billion tons of\r\ncoal in seams of minable thickness remain in the ground in our state;\r\nthese are the largest known reserves of bituminous coal of any state in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS COAL USED FOR?\r\n\r\nElectric power generation consumes the greater part of the annual coal\r\nproduction in Illinois. Coal is also used for home and commercial\r\nheating, for production of coke, and for manufacturing various chemical\r\ncompounds from coal tar. Products derived from coal tar include drugs\r\nand medicines, plastics, synthetic fibres, perfumes, flavorings, dyes,\r\nsynthetic rubbers, explosives, specialized oils, solvents, wood\r\npreservatives, tarlike paving and roofing materials, and some gas. The\r\ngas is both produced and utilized in the coke industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS COKE?\r\n\r\nCoke is a material produced by burning coal in the absence of air so\r\nthat most of the gases and water are driven off without consuming the\r\nsolid portion. The resulting solid coke is a strong, porous, combustible\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IMPORTANT IS COKE AND HOW IS IT USED?\r\n\r\nThe structure and nature of coke make it a valuable fuel for blast\r\nfurnace use in the production of steel. In the past, most of the coal\r\nused in the manufacture of coke has come from areas of higher quality\r\ncoal outside of our state. However, at present, over 1,000,000 tons of\r\nIllinois coal are mined annually for the production of metallurgical\r\ncoke.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12—Estimated total coal production by counties\r\n    from 1882 through 1963.]\r\n\r\n  Area underlain by coal-bearing rocks\r\n  Counties producing coal in January 1965\r\n  Total Production 3,749,423,534 tons\r\n  71 counties producing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        STONE AND STONE PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TYPES OF STONE ARE PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nLimestone and dolomite are the most abundant rocks quarried in Illinois.\r\nSmall amounts of marble, limestone, and sandstone for building stone are\r\nalso produced. In addition, some glacial boulders and cobbles are used\r\nfor rock gardens and in home construction. The crushed limestone\r\nindustry is Illinois’ most important rock products industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE?\r\n\r\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock that consists chiefly of calcite, which\r\nis composed of calcium, carbon, and oxygen. Dolomite is a variety of\r\nlimestone that contains considerable magnesium in addition to the other\r\nelements. Limestones were deposited on the floors of ancient seas that\r\nrepeatedly covered most parts of Illinois. Shelled creatures, corals,\r\nand coral reefs helped build up the thick limestone deposits (figs. 13\r\nand 14).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 13—Piece of limestone largely made up of\r\n    fossil brachiopod shells.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE QUARRIES LOCATED IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nLimestone and dolomite quarries are located along the southern, western,\r\nand northern margins of the state where the thick deposits of these\r\nrocks crop out at the surface. Although bedrock was deposited in\r\nhorizontal layers, it has since been downfolded into the Illinois Basin\r\nwhose center is in southeastern Illinois. Thus, the thick limestones and\r\ndolomites that are quarried along the margins of the state are too\r\ndeeply buried to be quarried in the central part of this basin (fig.\r\n15).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 14—Fossils commonly found in Illinois rocks.]\r\n\r\n  _Strophomena_ 1×\r\n  _Paleoneilo_ 1×\r\n  _Ctenodonta_ ⅔×\r\n  _Dolmanites_ ½×\r\n  _Archimedes_ 1×\r\n  _Hormotoma Polygyra_ 1×\r\n  _Mucrospirifer_ 1½×\r\n  _Atrypa_ ⅔×\r\n  _Crinoid Columnais_ 1×\r\n  _Halysites_ ⅔×\r\n  _Hexagonaria_ 1×\r\n  _Microcylus_ 1×\r\n  _Streptelasma_ ⅔×\r\n  _Lithostrationella_ ½×\r\n  _Lophophyllum_ 1×\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 15—Diagrammatic cross section of the Illinois\r\n    Basin.]\r\n\r\n  _MISS.

The quarries located within the basin area produce stone for\r\nagricultural limestone, roads, and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AND WHERE ARE LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE USED?\r\n\r\nMillions of tons of stone are crushed annually to produce aggregate for\r\nuse in making concrete roads and buildings, for road surfacing, and for\r\nagricultural limestone. Agstone is applied to farmlands to neutralize\r\nsoil acidity, improve soil structure, add calcium and magnesium, and\r\npromote conditions favorable for the utilization of soil materials by\r\nplants. Large quantities of limestone are used in making lime and\r\ncement. There are three cement plants in northern Illinois—two at\r\nLaSalle and one at Dixon—and one in southern Illinois, at Joppa.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of stone are used for making alkalies and glass, for\r\nrailroad ballast, for building stone, for dusting coal mines to prevent\r\ncoal dust explosions, and for ingredients in mineral feeds for\r\nlivestock.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH STONE DOES ILLINOIS PRODUCE?\r\n\r\nA production of about 36 million tons of stone in 1963 was valued at\r\nalmost $48,000,000. The cement made from Illinois limestone in the same\r\nyear was valued at $32,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS CLAY AND HOW IS IT FORMED?\r\n\r\nWeathering or alteration of some rocks produces clay which is a very\r\nfine-grained, unconsolidated rock. Clay is made up of a group of\r\nminerals, of which illite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, and chlorite are\r\nthe most abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW EXTENSIVE ARE CLAY DEPOSITS IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nClay deposits in Illinois consist of Quaternary clays, which were\r\ndeposited by glaciers, lakes, and winds; and of fireclay, shale, kaolin,\r\nand “fuller’s earth,” all of which are bedrock deposits. Quaternary\r\nclay, fireclay, and shale resources occur widely in very large\r\nquantities; “fuller’s earth” and kaolin deposits are small in relation\r\nto other clay resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS ILLINOIS CLAY USED?\r\n\r\nSurface clay, shale, and fireclay are used in the manufacture of\r\nstructural clay products, such as brick, drain tile, and hollow block\r\n(fig. 16). Fireclay is used for a bonding agent in molding sand, for the\r\nmaking of stoneware vessels, for a plaster on the walls of industrial\r\nfurnaces, and for making refractory brick. Refractory brick must be able\r\nto withstand very high temperatures and is used to line industrial\r\nfurnaces, boilers, kilns, and ladles for molten steel.\r\n\r\nShale and clay are ground up and mixed with limestone in the manufacture\r\nof cement. Crucibles, refractories, china, and porcelain are made from\r\nkaolin. “Fuller’s earth” is used as a sweeping compound and as an animal\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 16—Typical Illinois bee-hive kiln.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE CLAY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nAbout $53,900,000 worth of clay products were manufactured in Illinois\r\nin 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SAND AND GRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE DO SAND AND GRAVEL COME FROM?\r\n\r\nGlacial deposits of sand and gravel are the chief source of these\r\nmaterials in Illinois, but chert or flint gravels that are older than\r\nthe glacial deposits are known and utilized locally in western and\r\nextreme southern Illinois. Sands of recent origin are dredged from\r\ndeposits in the larger rivers and streams (fig. 17), and commercial\r\nsilica sand is produced from sandstone bedrock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 17—Dredge equipment used in producing sand and\r\n    gravel.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE VALUE OF COMMON ILLINOIS SAND AND GRAVEL PRODUCTION?\r\n\r\nProduction of common sand and gravel totaled 27,115,000 tons at a value\r\nof $24,800,000 in 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SILICA SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS SILICA SAND?\r\n\r\nAlthough natural sands are aggregations of many kinds of small rock and\r\nmineral fragments, silica sand consists almost entirely of fine grains\r\nof a single mineral, quartz. The principal sources of Illinois silica\r\nsand are in LaSalle (Ottawa, Utica, Wedron, and Troy Grove areas) and\r\nOgle (Oregon area) Counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS SILICA SAND USED?\r\n\r\nSilica sand, produced in northern Illinois, is famous for its high\r\npurity, and is widely used in making glass. More than two-thirds of the\r\nraw material in common glass is silica sand.\r\n\r\nQuantities of silica sand are used as molding sand, because it can\r\nwithstand the high temperatures produced in casting steel and other\r\nmetals. It also is used for grinding and smoothing plate glass, for sand\r\nblasting, and for fracturing sand used to increase the production of oil\r\nwells. Some silica sand is ground to a fine powder and utilized as an\r\ningredient in scouring compounds, paint fillers, pottery, glazes, and\r\nenamels.\r\n\r\nA specially sized sand is produced from the St. Peter Sandstone\r\nFormation (Ordovician in age) that is used in testing the strength of\r\ncements and as a laboratory standard in various kinds of tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW VALUABLE IS SILICA SAND TO THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE?\r\n\r\nIllinois is a major producer of silica sand, having produced 2,900,000\r\ntons in 1963. The silica sand and ground silica produced in the same\r\nyear was valued at $11,400,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TRIPOLI\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS TRIPOLI AND WHERE IS IT FOUND?\r\n\r\nTripoli, also known as amorphous silica, is mined in Alexander County in\r\nsouthern Illinois. It is prepared for market by being ground to a fine\r\npowder. It consists of tiny particles of quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE USES FOR TRIPOLI?\r\n\r\nTripoli is used as “white rouge” in optical lens polishing, as a paint\r\nfiller, as a fine abrasive, in the ceramic industry, and for many other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FLUORSPAR\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS FLUORSPAR?\r\n\r\nFluorspar, or fluorite, is a glassy mineral that is commonly gray,\r\nwhite, or colorless, but may be green, blue, purple, yellow, or black.\r\nIt is composed of calcium and fluorine. Fluorite is not a gem because it\r\nis too fragile and soft. Mineral collectors seek it because it is\r\nattractive and because some varieties have the ability to glow under\r\ninvisible ultraviolet light (hence the term “fluorescence”).\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE FLUORSPAR DEPOSITS LOCATED AND HOW IMPORTANT IS ILLINOIS\r\nPRODUCTION?\r\n\r\nFluorspar produced in the United States comes chiefly from a small area\r\nin Illinois and Kentucky where it has been mined since 1842. Illinois\r\nproduced about 66 percent of the nation’s total in 1963. The state’s\r\nproduction amounted to more than 132,000 tons, valued at about\r\n$6,547,000. The crude ore is extracted from nearly horizontal bedded\r\ndeposits and from nearly vertical veins in mines up to 800 feet deep in\r\nPope and Hardin Counties. Finished fluorspar is produced from the crude\r\nore by separating and concentrating methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE FLUORSPAR PELLETS?\r\n\r\nIn the separation of fluorspar from the other materials with which it\r\nnaturally occurs, a process is used that involves grinding the spar to a\r\nvery fine powder. The powdered spar has a number of uses, but to suit it\r\nfor use as a flux (a substance which promotes fusion) it is made into\r\npellets by the use of a binder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS FLUORSPAR USED FOR?\r\n\r\nFluorspar is used extensively as a flux in the steel industry, but over\r\n50 percent of the spar produced in Illinois in 1963 was consumed in the\r\nmanufacture of hydrofluoric acid. A large portion of this acid\r\nproduction is used in the aluminum industry. Hydrofluoric acid is also\r\nemployed in the preparation of many fluorine compounds, particularly\r\nthose used in the production of fluorocarbons (refrigerants, plastics,\r\naerosols), insecticides, and high-energy fuels for rockets and missiles.\r\nThe fluorocarbons utilize about 40 percent of the hydrofluoric acid\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LEAD AND ZINC\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ORES YIELD LEAD AND ZINC IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nThe mineral galena is the principal ore of lead. Galena is gray in\r\ncolor, very heavy, has a bright metallic luster, and breaks into cubes\r\nalong steplike cleavage surfaces (fig. 18). It is composed of lead and\r\nsulfur.\r\n\r\nThe chief ore of zinc is the mineral sphalerite. It may be brown,\r\nyellow, or black. Sphalerite is a combination of zinc and sulfur, has a\r\nresinous luster, and is not as heavy as galena.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE LEAD AND ZINC MINES LOCATED AND HOW LONG HAVE THESE ORES BEEN\r\nMINED?\r\n\r\nAlthough the lead deposits of extreme northwestern Illinois (now Jo\r\nDaviess County) were reported by the French explorers in 1658 and are\r\nsaid to have been worked by the Indians, the influx of white settlers in\r\nthe early 1800’s marked the beginning of an extensive mining industry,\r\nwhich was an important factor in the early development of that part of\r\nthe state. The town of Galena takes its name from the mineral galena,\r\nwhich was the principal ore mined.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 18—Galena cubes.]\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the Upper Mississippi Valley produced 60 percent of all lead\r\nmined in the United States, which then ranked first in world lead\r\nproduction. Until about 1860, the zinc ore was considered useless, but\r\ntoday its total value is several times that of lead.\r\n\r\nLead mining began in southern Illinois in 1842. Lead and zinc production\r\nin this area is a by-product of fluorspar mining.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE VALUE OF THESE METALS PRODUCED IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nIn 1963, Illinois produced 20,377 tons of zinc valued at about\r\n$4,677,500 and 2,901 tons of lead worth about $626,600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GROUND WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS GROUND WATER?\r\n\r\nGround water is water that fills all openings in earth materials in the\r\nzone of permanent saturation. The top of the zone of saturation is\r\ncalled the water table. The source of ground water is precipitation\r\n(rain and snow) that seeps into the soil and percolates downward. Below\r\nthe water table, ground water moves slowly toward places of discharge\r\nsuch as springs, lakes, rivers, marshes, and wells. Water falls to the\r\nground, moves through the rocks, returns to the surface, and finally\r\ngets back to the atmosphere by evaporation and from plants (fig. 19).\r\nThis cycle is continuously repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT KINDS OF ROCKS YIELD GROUND WATER?\r\n\r\nGround water is most readily obtained from saturated rocks that have\r\nfairly large openings between grains (such as sand, gravel, and\r\nsandstone) or have interconnected cracks or channels (such as\r\nlimestones). Rocks that contain ground water and that will yield it to\r\nwells are called aquifers. Sand and gravel beds are widely used aquifers\r\nin Illinois.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 19—Source, movement, and occurrence of ground\r\n    water. Arrows in aquifers show direction of flow of water.]\r\n\r\n  _EVAPORATION_\r\n  SAND AND GRAVEL WELL\r\n  Water Table\r\n  River sand and gravel\r\n  ARTESIAN WELLS\r\n  _EVAPORATION_\r\n  River\r\n  WELL\r\n  COLLECTING AREA FOR ARTESIAN WATER\r\n  PRECIPITATION\r\n  Crater\r\n  WATER TABLE WELL\r\n  _Lake_\r\n  Glacial pebbly clay\r\n  Glacial sand and aquifer\r\n  Shale\r\n  Sandstone aquifer\r\n  Limestone aquifer\r\n  Shale\r\n  GROUND-WATER RESERVOIR\r\n\r\n\r\nIS WATER FOUND IN UNDERGROUND LAKES AND RIVERS IN ILLINOIS?\r\n\r\nNo. There are a few large springs that flow from rocks along river\r\nbluffs in Illinois, but most ground water occurs in tiny openings within\r\nthe rocks. Ground water reservoirs may be regarded as similar to sponges\r\nrather than as underground lakes or rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY DO WELLS SOMETIMES GO DRY?\r\n\r\nThe water table rises and falls seasonally and from year to year,\r\ndepending upon the amount of precipitation. Sometimes the water table\r\nmay fall below the bottom of the well or below the pump. Sometimes\r\noverpumping the well or pumping too many wells in a small area lowers\r\nthe water table sufficiently to check the yield of the well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS AN ARTESIAN WELL?\r\n\r\nAn artesian well is one in which pressure forces water to rise in the\r\nwell above the level where it was found. In some artesian wells water\r\nflows out at the surface. Conditions for artesian wells are illustrated\r\nin figure 19. The shale above the sandstone and limestone aquifers in\r\nthe figure is “tight” and does not permit water to escape upward to the\r\nlevel at which it enters the aquifers in the intake areas. The water is\r\nunder natural pressure. When a well is drilled through the shale and\r\ninto the aquifers, water rises, seeking its own level. Most of the deep\r\nwells in northern Illinois are artesian wells, though few of them flow\r\nat the surface anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL YOU ALWAYS FIND WATER IF YOU GO DEEP ENOUGH?\r\n\r\nThis is generally true. However, in much of the southern two-thirds of\r\nIllinois the deeper waters are quite salty. Therefore, only the upper\r\nfew hundred feet of rocks are worth exploring for water. In the northern\r\nthird of Illinois, where the deepest water wells are located, fresh\r\nwater extends in some places to more than 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CAN GROUND WATER BE FOUND?\r\n\r\nThe most effective way of locating a ground water supply is by using\r\nknowledge of the geology and ground water conditions—gained partly from\r\nstudy of existing well records—to determine the most favorable areas and\r\ndepths to drill to.\r\n\r\nAn additional tool that has been used successfully in Illinois is the\r\nelectrical earth resistivity survey. The resistivity survey attempts to\r\nlocate buried sand and gravel layers that commonly are sources of ground\r\nwater. Test drilling is recommended at sites that appear to be underlain\r\nby sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nThere is no known method that will positively “find” ground water\r\nwithout drilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ILLINOIS STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY IS GEOLOGY IMPORTANT?\r\n\r\nGeology and allied sciences are being called upon increasingly to aid in\r\nmore intelligent and efficient discovery and utilization of mineral\r\nwealth. Our national life and welfare are more and more dependent upon\r\nthe further discovery and proper use of the earth’s natural resources.\r\nIllinois is widely recognized by scientists, industrialists, and\r\neducators as being outstanding in its promotion of research and\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM THE SURVEY?\r\n\r\nThe occurrence and distribution of rock and mineral deposits in Illinois\r\nare studied by the State Geological Survey Division of the Department of\r\nRegistration and Education (fig. 20). In seeking new information\r\nconcerning the state’s natural mineral resources, physical and chemical\r\nstudies of useful rocks, minerals, and mineral products are made.\r\nTechniques and methods are developed and experiments are conducted to\r\nfind and prepare Illinois’ mineral substances for use.\r\n\r\nThe results of the Survey’s field and laboratory findings are published\r\nand made available to all citizens upon request. Much information that\r\nhas not been published is in the open files of the Geological Survey\r\nwhere it may be examined by the public. Members of the Survey’s\r\nscientific and technical staff answer requests for information received\r\nby letter, telegram, telephone, or personal interview.\r\n\r\nSince the main ideas of geology are easy to understand and greatly\r\nincrease one’s enjoyment and appreciation of the world in which we live,\r\nthe Geological Survey publishes popular and educational booklets\r\ndesigned for the use of Illinois teachers and students. The Survey also\r\ndistributes a labeled collection of rocks and minerals for class use in\r\nIllinois schools. Six geological science field trips are conducted each\r\nyear throughout various sections of the state for teachers and\r\ninterested laymen. Members of the Survey staff give illustrated lectures\r\nto organized groups about the geology and mineral resources of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 20—Geological Survey offices are located in\r\n    the Natural Resources Building, Urbana, Illinois.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE CHARGE FOR THESE SERVICES?\r\n\r\nAll of the Survey’s publications are distributed free to schools and\r\nteachers. Only topographic maps and certain base maps, which are\r\nprepared and printed by the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington, are\r\nsold at nominal prices.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Geologic column]\r\n\r\n Era                                 General Types of Rocks\r\n    Period or System and Thickness\r\n       Epoch\r\n\r\n CENOZOIC “Recent Life”\r\n Age of Mammals\r\n    Quaternary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pleistocene or Glacial Age\r\n                        Recent—alluvium in river valleys\r\n                        Glacial till, glacial outwash, gravel, sand,\r\n                        silt lake deposits of clay and silt, loess and\r\n                        sand dunes; covers nearly all of state except\r\n                        northwest corner and southern tip\r\n    Tertiary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pliocene         Chert gravel; present in northern, southern, and\r\n                        western Illinois\r\n       Eocene           Mostly micaceous sand with some silt and clay;\r\n                        present only in southern Illinois\r\n       Paleocene        Mostly clay, little sand; present only in\r\n                        southern Illinois\r\n MESOZOIC “Middle Life”\r\n Age of Reptiles\r\n    Cretaceous          Mostly sand, some thin beds of clay and,\r\n    0-300′              locally, gravel; present only in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n PALEOZOIC “Ancient Life”\r\n Age of Amphibians and Early Plants\r\n    Pennsylvanian       Largely shale and sandstone with beds of coal,\r\n    0-3,000′            limestone, and clay\r\n    (“Coal Measures”)\r\n    Mississippian       Black and gray shale at base; middle zone of\r\n    0-3,500′            thick limestone that grades to siltstone, chert,\r\n                        and shale; upper zone of interbedded sandstone,\r\n                        shale and limestone\r\n    Age of Fishes\r\n    Devonian            Thick limestone, minor sandstones and shales;\r\n    0-1,500′            largely chert and cherty limestone in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n    Age of Invertebrates\r\n    Silurian            Principally dolomite and limestone\r\n    0-1,000′\r\n    Ordovician          Largely dolomite and limestone but contains\r\n    500-2,000′          sandstone, shale, and siltstone formations\r\n    Cambrian            Chiefly sandstones with some dolomite and shale;\r\n    1,500-3,000′        exposed only in small areas in north-central\r\n                        Illinois\r\n ARCHEOZOIC and PROTEROZOIC\r\n                        Igneous and metamorphic rocks; known in Illinois\r\n                        only from deep wells\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n                   _Illinois State Geological Survey\r\n                         Educational Series 9_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
