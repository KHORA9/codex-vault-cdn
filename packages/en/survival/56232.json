The last day of their liberty was spent\r\nby the “B. O. W. C.” at their encampment in the woods. They found it\r\nin so good a condition, that it was even more attractive than when they\r\nleft it. The dam had proved water-tight; the pool was full to the\r\nbrim; the trees overhung with a denser foliage, while all around the\r\nfresh-turned earth was covered with young grass, springing forth with\r\nthat rapidity which marks the growth of vegetation in these colder\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the day when they came up, and they were accompanied by\r\nthe Perpetual Grand Panjandrum, who carried on his woolly head a basket\r\ncrammed to the top with a highly-diversified and very luxurious lunch,\r\nwhich it had been the joy of that aged functionary to gather for the\r\npresent occasion.\r\n\r\n“Dar!” he exclaimed, as he put down his burden. “Ef you habn’t enough\r\nto feed you dis time, den I’m a nigga. Dar’s turkeys, an mutton pies, an\r\nhoe-cakes, an ham, an ginger-beer, an doughnuts, an de sakes ony knows\r\nwhat. All got up for de special benefit ob de Bee see double bubble\r\nBredren, by de Gran Pan dandle drum. You’ll be de greatest specims ob\r\nchil’en in de woods dat ebber I har tell on. You gwine to be jes like\r\nwild Injins, and live in de wilderness like de prophets; an I’m gwine to\r\nbe de black raven dat’ll bring you food. But now,” he added, “de black\r\ncrow must fly back agen.”\r\n\r\n“O, no, Solomon,” said they, as he started. “Don’t go. The ‘B. O. W.\r\nC.’ won’t be anything without you. Stay with us, and be the Grand\r\nPanjandrum.”\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t!”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, you must.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t, no how.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t, De doctor’d knock my ole head off. De doctor _mus_ hab ole\r\nSolomon. Can’t get along widout him. Yah, yah, yah! Why, de whole\r\n’Cad-emy’d go to tarnal smash ef ole Solomon clar’d out dat way.\r\nGracious sakes! Why, belubbed bred-ren, I’m sprised at you. An’ me de\r\nGran Pandrum!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Bart, gravely. “Too true. It was very thoughtless in us,\r\nGrand Panjandrum; but don’t say that we asked you. Keep dark.”\r\n\r\n“Sartin,” said old Solomon, with a grin. “Dar’s no fear but what I’ll\r\nkeep dark. Allus been as dark as any ole darky could be. Yah, yah, yah!”\r\n And he rolled up his eyes till nothing could be seen but the whites of\r\nthem, and chuckled all over, and then, with a face of mock solemnity,\r\nbobbed his old head, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Far well, mos wos’ful, an’ all de res ob de belubbed breddren.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he departed.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the boys gave themselves up to the business of the day. And\r\nwhat was that? O, nothing in particular, but many things in general.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there was a grand jubilation to be made over the\r\nencampment of the “B. O. W. C.;” then a grand lamentation over the end\r\nof the recess. Then they talked over a thousand plans of future action.\r\nIn these woods there were no bears, nor were there any wild Indians;\r\nbut at any rate, there were squirrels to be shot at, and there were\r\nGaspereaugians to be armed against.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly necessary, then, that they should have arms of offence\r\nand defence.\r\n\r\nTo decide on these arms was a matter that required long debate. One was\r\nin favor of clubs; another, of Chinese crackers; a third had a weakness\r\nfor boomerangs; a fourth suggested lassos; and a fifth thought that\r\nan old cannon, with Bart’s pistol, and the gun, would form their most\r\nefficient means of defence. But in the course of a long discussion, all\r\nthese opinions were modified; and the final result was in favor of the\r\ncomparatively light and trifling arms--bows and arrows. In addition\r\nto these, whistles were thought to be desirable, in order to assist\r\nin decoying the unsuspecting squirrel, or in warning off the prowling\r\nGaspereaugian.\r\n\r\nOne powerful cause of their unanimous decision was the pleasing fact,\r\nthat bows, arrows, and whistles, could be manufactured on the spot by\r\ntheir own jackknives. Ash trees were all around, from which they could\r\nshape the elastic bow; tall spruce trees were there, from which they\r\ncould fashion the light, straight shaft; and there, too, were the\r\nwell-known twigs, from which they could whittle the willow whistle.\r\n\r\nIt was jolly--was it not? Could anything be more so? Certainly not. So\r\nthey all thought, and they gave themselves up, therefore, to the joy of\r\nthe occasion. They bathed in the pool. They dressed again, and lay on\r\nthe grass in the sun. They gathered ash, and spruce, and willow. They\r\ncollected also large quantities of fresh, soft moss, which they strewed\r\nover the floor of the camp, in which they at length sought refuge from\r\nthe sun, and brought out their knives, and went to work.\r\n\r\nHere they sat, then, working away like busy bees, two at bows, two at\r\narrows, and one at whistles, laughing, singing, talking, joking, telling\r\nstories, and making such a general and indiscriminate hubbub as had\r\nnever before been heard in these quiet woods; when suddenly they were\r\nstartled by a dark shadow which fell in front of the doorway, and\r\ninstantly retreated, followed by the crackling sound of dried twigs.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Bart was on his feet.\r\n\r\n“_Who goes there?_” he cried, in a loud but very firm voice, while at\r\nthe same instant the thought flashed into his mind, and into the minds\r\nof all the others,--The Gaspereaugians!--\r\n\r\nFull of this thought, they all arose, even while Bart was speaking, with\r\ntheir souls full of a desperate resolution.\r\n\r\n“_Who goes there?_” cried Bart a second time, in still louder tones.\r\n\r\nA faint crackle among the dried twigs was the only respose that came.\r\n\r\n“_Who goes there?_” cried Bart a third time, in a voice of deadly\r\ndetermination. “_Speak or--I’ll fire!_”\r\n\r\nAt this menacing and imperative summons there came a response. It came\r\nin the shape of a figure that stole forward in front of the doorway,\r\nslowly and carefully; a figure that disclosed to their view the familiar\r\nform, and the meek, the mild, the venerable, and the well-remembered\r\nface of Captain Corbet! Greeted with one universal shout of joy.\r\n\r\n“Here we air agin, boys,” said the venerable commander, as he stepped\r\ninside, and looked all around with a scrutinizing glance. “We’ve ben\r\ntogether over the briny deep, an here’s the aged Corbet, right side up,\r\nin good health, and comes hopin to find you in the same.”\r\n\r\n“Corbet! Corbet! Captain Corbet! Three cheers for the commander of the\r\ngreat expedition to Blomidon!”\r\n\r\nAnd upon this there rang out three cheers as loud and as vigorous as\r\ncould be produced by the united lungs of the five boys.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet regarded them with an amiable smile.\r\n\r\n“Kind o’ campin’ out?” said he at last. “I thought by what you told me\r\nyou’d be up to somethin like this, an I come down thinkin I’d find you;\r\nand here we air.”\r\n\r\n“How’s the baby, captain?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“In a terewly wonderful good state of health and sperits--kickin an\r\ncrowin like mad; ony jest now he’s sound asleep--bless him. I’ve ben\r\na-nussin of him ever sence I arrove, which I feel to be a perroud\r\nperrivelege, an the highest parental jy.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right; and now sit down an sing us a song.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, as to settin, I’ll set; but as to singin, I hain’t the time nor\r\nthe vice. The fact is, I come down on _business_.”\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Corbet’s face assumed an expression of deep and dark\r\nmystery. He had a stick in his hand about a yard long, rather slender,\r\nand somewhat dirty. He now held out this stick, looked at it for a few\r\nmoments in indescribable solemnity, then closed his eyes, then shook\r\nhis head, and then, putting the stick behind his back, he drew a long\r\nbreath, and looked hard at the boys.\r\n\r\n“Business?” said Arthur; “what kind of business?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked all around with an air of furtive scrutiny, and\r\nthen regarded the boys with more solemnity than ever. He held out his\r\nstick again, and regarded it with profound earnestness.\r\n\r\n“It’s a diskivery,” said he.\r\n\r\n“A discovery?” asked Bart, full of wonder at Captain Corbet’s very\r\nsingular manner; “a discovery? What kind of a discovery?”\r\n\r\n“A diskivery,” continued Captain Corbet; “and this here stick,”\r\n he continued, holding it forth, “this here stick is the identical\r\nindividooal article that’s made the diskivery to me. ’Tain’t everybody\r\nI’d tell; but you boys air different. I trust youns. Do you see that?”\r\n shaking the stick; “do you know what that air is? Guess, now.”\r\n\r\n“That?” said Bart, somewhat contemptuously. “Why, what’s that? It’s only\r\na common stick.”\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Corbet seemed deeply offended. He caressed the stick\r\naffectionately, and looked reproachfully at Bart.\r\n\r\n“A stick?” said he at last; “a common stick? No, _sir_. ’Tain’t a\r\nstick at all. Excuse me. Thar’s jest whar you’re out of your reckonin.\r\n’Tain’t a stick at all; no, nor anythin like it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “if that isn’t a stick, I should like to know what\r\nyou call one.”\r\n\r\n“O, you’ll know--you’ll know in time,” said Captain Corbet, whose air of\r\nmystery now returned, and made the boys more anxious than ever to find\r\nout the cause.\r\n\r\n“If it isn’t a stick, what is it?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Wal--it ain’t a stick, thar.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, then?”\r\n\r\n“It’s--a--ROD,” said Captain Corbet, slowly and impressively.\r\n\r\n“A rod? Well, what then? Isn’t a rod a stick?”\r\n\r\n“No, _sir_, not by a long chalk. Besides, this here’s a very pecooliar\r\nrod.” #\r\n\r\n“How’s that?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet rose, went to the door, looked on every side with eager\r\nscrutiny, then returned, and looked mysteriously at the boys; then he\r\nstepped nearer; then he bent down his head; and finally he said, in an\r\neager and piercing whisper,--\r\n\r\n“_It’s a mineral rod!_”\r\n\r\n“A mineral rod?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Captain Corbet, stepping back, and watching the\r\nboys eagerly, so as to see the full effect of this startling piece of\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe effect was such as might have satisfied even Captain Corbet, with\r\nall his mystery. A mineral rod! what could be more exciting to the\r\nimagination of boys? Had they not heard of such things? Of course they\r\nhad. They knew all about them. They had read of mineral rods as they had\r\nread of other things. They had feasted their imaginations on pirates,\r\nbrigands, wizards, necromancers, alchy-mists, astrologers, and all the\r\nother characters which go to make up the wonder-world of a boy; and\r\namong all the things of this wonder-world, nothing was more impressive\r\nthan a mineral rod. This was the magic wand that revealed the secrets of\r\nthe earth--this was the resistless “sesame” that opened the way to the\r\nhoarded treasures of the bandit--this was the key that would unlock the\r\ncoffers, filled with gold, and buried deep in the earth by the robber\r\nchief or the pirate captain. What wonder, then, that the very mention of\r\nthat word was enough to excite them all in an instant, and to turn their\r\nminds from good-natured contempt to eager and irrepressible curiosity?\r\n\r\n“I’m no fool,” said Captain Corbet, impressively--“I know what I’m a\r\ndoin. I got this mineral rod last year, and went round everywhar over\r\nthe hull country. It didn’t come natral, at fust, but I kep on. You see\r\nI had a motive. It wan’t myself. It wan’t Mrs. Corbet. It was the\r\nbabby! He’s a growin, and I’m a declinin; an afore he grows to be a man,\r\nwhar’ll I be? I want to have somethin to leave him. That’s what sot me\r\nup to it. Nobody knows anythin about it. I darsen’t tell Mrs. Corbet.\r\nI have to do it on the sly. But when I saw you, I got to love you, an I\r\nknew I could trust you. For you see I’ve made a diskiv-ery, an I’m goin\r\nto tell you; an that’s what brought me down here. Besides, you’re all\r\nfavored by luck; an ef I have your help, it’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\n“But what _is_ the discovery?” asked the boys, on whom these preliminary\r\nremarks made a still deeper impression.\r\n\r\n“Wal--as I was a sayin,” resumed the captain--“I’ve been a prowlin round\r\nand round over the hull country with the mineral rod. It’s full of\r\nholes. Them old Frenchmen left lots of money. That’s what I’m a huntin\r\narter, and that’s what I’ve found.”\r\n\r\nThese last few words, added in a low but penetrating whisper, thrilled\r\nthe boys with strange excitement.\r\n\r\n“Have you really found anything?” asked Bart, eagerly. “What is it?\r\nWhen? Where? How?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet took off his hat very solemnly, and then, plunging his\r\nhand into his pocket, he drew forth a crowd of miscellaneous articles,\r\none by one. He thus brought forth a button, a knife, a string, a fig of\r\ntobacco, a pencil, a piece of chalk, a cork, a stone, a bit of leather,\r\na child’s rattle, a lamp-burner, a bit of ropeyarn, a nail, a screw,\r\na hammer, a pistol barrel, a flint, some matches, a horse’s tooth, the\r\nmouthpiece of a fog-horn, a doll’s head, an envelope, a box of caps,\r\na penholder, a nut, a bit of candy, a piece of zinc, a brass cannon, a\r\npin, a bent knitting needle, some wire, a rat skin, a memorandum book,\r\na bone, a squirrel’s tail, a potato, a wallet, half of an apple, an\r\nink bottle, a lamp-wick, “Bonaparte’s Oraculum,” a burning glass, a\r\ncorkscrew, a shaving brush, and very many other articles, all of which\r\nhe put in his hat in a very grave and serious manner.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded with his other hand to unload his other pocket, the\r\ncontents of which were quite as numerous and as varied; but in neither\r\nof the pockets did he find what he wished.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I declar!” he cried, suddenly. “I remember, now, I put it in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he felt in his waistcoat pocket, and drew forth a copper\r\ncoin, which he held forth to the boys with a face of triumph.\r\n\r\nBart took it, and the others crowded eagerly around him to look at it.\r\nIt was very much worn; indeed, on one side it was quite smooth, and the\r\nmarks were quite effaced; but on the other side there was a head, and\r\naround it were letters which were legible. They read this:\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS XIV. ROI DE FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of which sank deep into their souls.\r\n\r\n“It’s an old French coin,” said Bruce at length. “Where did you get it?\r\nDid you find it yourself?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet made no reply, but only held up his mineral rod, and\r\nsolemnly tapped it.\r\n\r\n“Did you find it with that?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\nThe captain nodded with mysterious and impressive emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Mind, now, it’s a secret.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet slowly, “it’s a very serous ondertakin; an ef\r\nit wan’t for the babby, an me hopin to leave him a fortin, I wouldn’t be\r\nconsarned in it. Any how, you see, as I was tell-in, I ben sarchin; an\r\nnot long before we sailed I was out one day with the mineral rod, an\r\nit pinted--it pinted--it did--in one spot. It’s an ole French cellar.\r\nThar’s a pot of gold buried thar, boys--that I know. The mineral rod\r\nturned down hard.”\r\n\r\n“And did you dig there?” asked Bart, anxiously. “Did you try it?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t a shovel. Besides, I was afeard I might be seen. Then, agin, I\r\nwanted help.”\r\n\r\n“But didn’t you find this coin there?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet again shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he. “I found that thar kine in another cellar; but in that\r\ncellar the rod didn’t railly _pint_. So I didn’t dig. I went on a\r\nsarchin till I found one whar it did pint. It shows how things air.\r\nThar’s money--thar’s other kines a buried in the ground. Now I tell\r\nyou what. Let’s be pardners, an go an dig up that thar pot of gold.\r\n’Tain’t at all in my line. ’Tain’t everybody that I’d tell. But\r\nyou’ve got my confidence; an I trust on you. Besides, you’ve got luck.\r\nNo,” continued the captain in a dreamy and somewhat mournful tone,\r\n“’tain’t in my line for me, at my age to go huntin arter buried\r\ntreasure; but then that babby! Every look, every cry, every crow, that’s\r\ngiven by that bee-lessed offsprin, tetches my heart’s core; an I pine\r\nto be a de win somethin for him--to smooth the way for his infant feet,\r\nwhen poor old Corbet’s gone. For I can’t last long. Yes--yes--I must do\r\nit for the babby.”\r\n\r\nEvery word that Captain Corbet uttered, except, perhaps, his remarks\r\nabout the “babby,” only added to the kindling excitement of the boys.\r\nA mineral rod! a buried treasure! What could be more overpowering than\r\nsuch a thought! In an instant the camp in the woods seemed to lose all\r\nits attractions in their eyes. To play at camping out--to humor the\r\npretence of being bandits--was nothing, compared with the glorious\r\nreality of actually digging in the ground, under the guidance of a real\r\nmineral rod, for a buried pot of gold; yet it ought to be explained,\r\nthat, to these boys, it was not so much the value of any possible\r\ntreasure that might be buried and exhumed which excited them, as the\r\nidea of the enterprise itself--an enterprise which was so full of all\r\nthe elements of romantic yet mysterious adventure. How tremendous was\r\nthe secret which had thus been intrusted to them! How impressive was the\r\nsight of that mineral rod! How overpowering was the thought of a pot of\r\ngold, buried long ago by some fugitive Frenchman! How convincing was the\r\nsight of that copper coin! And, finally, how very appropriate was such\r\nan enterprise as this to their own secret society of the “B. O. W. C.”!\r\nIt was an enterprise full of solemnity and mystery; beset with unknown\r\nperil; surrounded with secrecy and awe; a deed to be attempted in\r\ndarkness and in silence; an undertaking which would supply the “B. O. W.\r\nC.” with that for which they had pined so long--a purpose.\r\n\r\n“But _is_ there any money buried?” asked Phil.\r\n\r\n“Money buried?” said Bart. “Of course, and lots of it. When the French\r\nAcadians were banished, they couldn’t take their money away. They must\r\nhave left behind all that they had. And they had lots of it. Haven’t you\r\nread all about ‘Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand\r\nPré? Of course you have. Well, if he was the wealthiest, others were\r\nwealthy. That stands to reason. And if so, what did they do with their\r\nwealth? Where did they keep their money? They hadn’t any banks. They\r\ncouldn’t buy stock, and all that sort of thing. What did they do with\r\nit, then? What? Why, they buried it, of course. That’s the way all\r\nhalf-civilized people manage. That’s what the Hindoos do, and the\r\nPersians, and the Chinese. People call it ‘hoarding.’ They say there’s\r\nenough gold and silver buried in the earth in India and China to pay olf\r\nthe national debt; and I believe there’s enough money buried about here\r\nby the old Acadians to buy up all the farms of Grand Pré.”\r\n\r\nBart spoke earnestly, and in a tone of deep conviction which was shared\r\nby all the others. The copper coin and the mineral rod had done\r\ntheir work. They lost all taste for the camp, and its pool, and its\r\noverarching trees, and its seclusion, and were now eager to be off with\r\nCaptain Corbet. Before this new enterprise even the greatest of their\r\nrecent adventures dwindled into insignificance. Captain Corbet, with\r\nhis magic wand, stood before them, inviting them to greater and grander\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\nA long conversation followed, and Captain Corbet began to think that the\r\npot of gold was already invested. The boys took his mineral rod,\r\nwhich he did not give up until he had been for a long time coaxed and\r\nentreated they passed it from hand to hand; each one closely inspected\r\nit, and balanced it on his finger so as to test the mode in which it\r\nworked; each one asked him innumerable questions about it, and gave it a\r\nlong and solemn trial.\r\n\r\n“But where is the place?” asked Bart. “Is it very far from here?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t very far off,” said he. “I’ll show you.”\r\n\r\n“Which way?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\nThe captain waved his rod in the direction of the Academy.\r\n\r\n“What! That way?” asked Bart. “Are the cellars there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean those. What! Just behind the Academy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the ‘Old French Orchard,’ then,” cried Bart--“the ‘Old French\r\nOrchard.’ The only cellars in that direction are under the old French\r\napple trees, on the top of the hill. Is that the place you mean,\r\ncaptain?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the indentical individool spot,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Old French Orchard’!” exclaimed the other boys in surprise; for\r\nthey had expected to be taken to some more remote and very different\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “that thar place’s a very pecooliar place.\r\nYou see thar’s a lot o’ cellars jest thar, an then the ole apple\r\ntrees--they’re somethin. The ole Frenchman, that lived up thar, must hev\r\nben rich.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” exclaimed Bart, “Captain Corbet’s right. The Frenchman\r\nthat lived on that place must have been rich. For my part, I believe\r\nthat he was no other than ‘Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer\r\nin Grand Pré.’ He buried all his money there, no doubt. This is one of\r\nhis French sous. Come along, boys; we’ll find that pot of gold.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words they all set out along with Captain Corbet for the\r\n“Old French Orchard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_The Old French Orchard.--The French Acadians.--The ruined\r\nHouses.--Captain Corbet in the Cellar.--Mysterious Movements.--The\r\nMineral Bod--Where is the Pot of Cold?--Excitement.--Plans, Projects,\r\nand Proposals._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hill on which Grand Pré Academy was built sloped upwards behind it,\r\nin a gentle ascent, for about a mile, when it descended abruptly into\r\nthe valley of the Gaspereaux. For about a quarter of a mile back of\r\nthe Academy there were smooth, cultivated meadows, which were finally\r\nbounded by a deep gully. At the bottom of this there ran a brawling\r\nbrook, and on the other side was that dense forest in which the boys\r\nbuilt their camps. Here, on the cleared lands just by the gully, was the\r\nfavorite play-ground of the school. Happy were the boys who had such\r\na play-ground. High up on the slope of that hill, it commanded a\r\nmagnificent prospect. Behind, and on either side, were dense, dark\r\nwoods; but in front there stood revealed a boundless scene. Beneath was\r\nthe Academy. Far down to the right spread away the dike lands of Grand\r\nPré, bounded by two long, low islands, which acted as a natural barrier\r\nagainst the turbulent waters; and farther away rose the dark outline of\r\nHorton Bluff, a wild, precipitous cliff, at the mouth of the Gaspereaux\r\nRiver, marking the place where the hills advanced into the sea, and\r\nthe marsh lands ended. Beyond this, again, there spread away the wide\r\nexpanse of Minas Bay, full now with the flood tide--a vast sheet of blue\r\nwater, dotted with the white sails of passing vessels, and terminated in\r\nthe dim and hazy distance by those opposite shores, which had been the\r\nscene of their late adventures--Parrsboro’, Pratt’s Cove, and the Five\r\nIslands. Far away towards the left appeared fields arrayed in the living\r\ngreen of opening spring; the wide plains of Cornwallis, with its long\r\nreaches of dike lands, separated by ridges of wood land, and bounded by\r\nthe dark form of the North Mountain. Through all this, from afar, flowed\r\nthe Cornwallis River, with many a winding, rolling now with a full,\r\nstrong flood before them and beyond them, till, with a majestic sweep,\r\nit poured its waters into that sea from which it had received them.\r\nFinally, full before them, dark, gloomy, frowning, with its crest\r\ncovered with rolling fog-clouds, and the white sea-foam gleaming at its\r\nbase, rose the central object of this magnificent scene,--the towering\r\ncliff--Blomidon.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene which burst upon the eyes of the boys as they crossed\r\nthe brook, and ascended the other side of the gully. Familiar that\r\nscene was, and yet, in spite of its familiarity, it had never lost its\r\nattractions to them; and for a moment they paused involuntarily, and\r\nlooked out before them. For there is this peculiarity about the scenery\r\nof Grand Pré, that it is not possible for it to become familiar, in\r\nthe common sense of the word. That scene is forever varying, and the\r\nvariations are so great, that every day has some new prospect to offer.\r\nLand, sea, and sky, all undergo incessant changes. There is the Basin\r\nof Minas, which is ever changing from red to blue, from a broad sea to\r\na contracted strait, hemmed in by mud flats. There is the sky, with its\r\nchanges from deepest azure to dreamy haze, or impenetrable mist. There\r\nare rivers which change from fulness to emptiness, majestic at the flow\r\nof tide, indistinguishable at the ebb. There is Blomidon, which every\r\nday is arrayed in some new robe; sometimes pale-green, at other times\r\ndeep purple; now light-gray, again dark-blue; and thus it goes through\r\ninnumerable changes, from the pale neutral tints which it catches\r\nfrom the overhanging fogs, down through all possible gradations, to\r\na darkness and a gloom, and a savage grandeur, which throw around it\r\nsomething almost of terror. Then come the seasons, which change the\r\nwide plains from brown to green, and from green to yellow, till winter\r\nappears, and robes all in white, and piles up for many a mile over\r\nthe shallow shores, and in the deep channels of the rivers, the ever\r\naccumulating masses of heaped-up ice.\r\n\r\nYet all the time, through all the seasons, while field and flood, river\r\nand mountain, sea and forest, are thus changing their aspect, there\r\nhangs over all an atmosphere which brings changes more wonderful than\r\nthese. The fog is forever struggling for an entrance here. The air in an\r\ninstant may bring forth its hidden watery vapors. High over Blomidon the\r\nmist banks are piled, and roll and writhe at the blast of the winds from\r\nthe sea. Here the mirage comes, and the eye sees the solid land uplifted\r\ninto the air; here is the haze, soft and mysterious as that of Southern\r\nItaly, which diffuses through all the scene an unutterable sweetness\r\nand tenderness. Here, in an instant, a change of wind may whirl all\r\nthe accumulated mists down from the crest of Blomidon into the vale of\r\nCornwallis, and force vast masses of fog-banks far up into the Basin of\r\nMinas, till mountain and valley, and river and plain, and sea and sky,\r\nare all alike snatched from view, and lost in the indistinguishable gray\r\nof one general fog.\r\n\r\nThe boys then had not grown wearied of the scene. Every day they were\r\nprepared for some fresh surprise, and they found in this incessant\r\ndisplay of the glory of nature, with its never-ending variety and its\r\nboundless scope, something which so filled their souls and enlarged\r\ntheir minds, that the perpetual contemplation of this was of itself an\r\neducation. And so strong was this feeling in all of them, that for\r\na moment all else was forgotten, and it was with an effort that they\r\nrecollected the captain and his mineral rod.\r\n\r\nUpon this they turned to carry out their purpose.\r\n\r\nIn this, place, and close by where they were standing, were several\r\nhollows in the ground, which were well known to be the cellars of houses\r\nonce occupied by French Acadians. At a little distance were a number of\r\napple trees, still growing, and now putting forth leaf, yet so old that\r\ntheir trunks and branches were all covered with moss, and the fruit\r\nitself, on ripening, was worthless. These trees also belonged to the\r\nformer owners of the houses--the fallen--the vanished race.\r\n\r\nAnd at the bottom of one of these holes Captain Corbet was standing,\r\nsolemnly balancing the mineral rod on one finger, and calling to the\r\nboys to come and watch how it “pinted” to the buried pot of gold.\r\n\r\nThese cellars were but a few out of hundreds which exist over the\r\ncountry, as sad memorials of those poor Acadians who were once so\r\nruthlessly driven into exile. The beautiful story of Evangeline has made\r\nthe sorrows of the Acadians familiar to all, and transformed Grand Pré\r\ninto a place of pilgrimage, where the traveller may find on every side\r\nthese sad vestiges of the former occupants. Into this beautiful land the\r\nFrench had come first; they had felled the forests, drained the marshes,\r\nand reared the dikes against the waters of the sea. Here they had\r\nincreased and multiplied, and long after Acadie had been ceded to the\r\nBritish they lived here unmolested. They still cherished that patriotic\r\nlove for France which was natural, and in the wars did not wish to fight\r\nagainst their own countrymen; but, on the other hand, they resisted the\r\nFrench agents who were sent among them to excite insurrection. A few\r\nacted against the British, but the majority were neutral. At length\r\nthe British enlarged their operations in Acadie, sent out thousands of\r\nemigrants, and began to settle the province. Then came a life and\r\ndeath struggle between Englishmen and Frenchmen, which spread over all\r\nAmerica, far along the Canadian frontier, and along the Ohio Valley, and\r\nsouthward to the Gulf of Mexico. The Frenchmen of Acadie were looked\r\non with suspicion. An effort was soon to be made against Louisbourg and\r\nQuebec, by which it was hoped that the French power would be crushed\r\ninto the dust. But the Acadians stood in the way. They were feared as\r\nbeing in league with the French and the Indians. Their pleasant lands,\r\nalso, were eagerly desired for an English population. And so it was\r\ndetermined to banish them all, and in the most cruel way conceivable.\r\nOrdinary banishment would not do; for then they might wander to Canada,\r\nand add their help to their brethren: so it was determined to send\r\nthem away, and scatter them over the coast of America. This plan\r\nwas thoroughly carried out. From Grand Pré two thousand were taken\r\naway--men, women, and children; families were divided forever, the\r\ndearest friends were parted never to meet again. Their fields were laid\r\nwaste; their houses, and barns, and churches, were given to the flames;\r\nand now the indelible traces of this great tragedy may be seen in the\r\nruined cellars which far and wide mark the surface of the country. Far\r\nand wide also may be seen their trees,--the apple trees,--moss-grown,\r\nand worn out, and gnarled, and decaying; the broad-spreading willow,\r\ngiving a grateful shade by the side of brooks; and the tall poplar, dear\r\nto the old Acadian, whose long rows may be seen from afar, rising like\r\nso many monuments over the graves of an extinct race.\r\n\r\n               Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers,\r\n\r\n               Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the wood lands,\r\n\r\n               Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?\r\n\r\n               Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed\r\n\r\n               Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October\r\n\r\n               Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o’er the\r\n\r\n                        ocean.\r\n\r\n               Nought but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand Pré.\r\n\r\nNow, the idea of the boys was not by any means so absurd as may be\r\nsupposed. It was within the bounds of possibility that a pot of money\r\nmight be in a French cellar. These Acadians had some wealth; they had\r\nbeen in the habit of hoarding it by burying it in the earth, and the\r\nbottom of the cellar was by no means an unlikely place. So sudden had\r\nbeen their seizure, that none of them had any time whatever to exhume\r\nany of their buried treasure, so as to carry it away with him. All\r\nhad been left behind--cattle, flocks, herds, grain, houses, furniture,\r\nclothes, and of course money. Vague tradition to this effect had long\r\ncirculated about the country, and there was a general belief that money\r\nwas buried in the ground, where it had been left by the Acadians. So,\r\nafter all, the boys were only the exponents of a popular belief.\r\n\r\nThe cellar might have originally been five or six feet in depth, but the\r\nfalling of the walls and the caving in of the earth had given it a shape\r\nlike a basin; and the depth at the centre was not more than four feet\r\nbelow the surrounding level. Around the edge were some stones which\r\nmarked the old foundation.\r\n\r\nThe boys came up to Captain Corbet, and watched him quietly, yet very\r\ncuriously. As for the illustrious captain, he felt to the utmost the\r\nimportance of the occasion. He was now no longer the captain of a\r\ngallant bark. He had become transformed into a species of necromancer.\r\nInstead of the familiar tiller, he held in his hand the rod of the\r\nmagician. All the solemnity of such a position was expressed in his\r\nvenerable features. After throwing a benignant smile upon the boys, his\r\neyes reverted to the rod, which was still balanced on his finger, and\r\nhe walked about, with a slow and solemn pace, to different parts of the\r\ncellar. First he went around the sides, stopping at every third step,\r\nand looking solemnly at the rod. But the rod preserved its balance, and\r\nmade no deflection whatever towards any place.\r\n\r\n“Go down to the middle, captain,” said Bart, who, in common with the\r\nother boys, had been watching these mysterious proceedings with intense\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head solemnly, and lifted up his unoccupied\r\nhand with a warning gesture.\r\n\r\n“H-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-h!” said Tom; “don’t interrupt him,\r\nBart.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet moved slowly about a little longer, and then descended to\r\nthe middle of the cavity. Here he planted himself, and his face assumed,\r\nif possible, an expression of still profounder solemnity.\r\n\r\nAnd now a strange sight appeared. The rod began to move!\r\n\r\nSlowly and gradually one end of it lowered, so slowly, indeed, that at\r\nfirst it was not noticed; but at last they all saw it plainly, for it\r\nwent down lower, yet in that gradual fashion; and the boys, as they\r\nlooked, became almost breathless in suspense.\r\n\r\nThey drew nearer, they crowded up closer to Captain Corbet, and watched\r\nthat rod as though all their future lives depended upon the vibration of\r\nthat slender and rather dirty stick.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken. Lower and lower went the rod.\r\n\r\nIt trembled on its balance! It quivered on Cap tain Corbet’s forefinger,\r\nas the lower end went down and dragged the rod out of its even poise. It\r\nslipped, and then--it fell.\r\n\r\nIt fell, down upon the very middle of the cellar, and lay there,\r\nmarking that spot, which to the minds of the boys seemed now, beyond the\r\npossibility of a doubt, to be the place where lay the pot of gold.\r\n\r\n“Thar,” said Captain Corbet, now breaking the silence. “Thar. You see\r\nwith your own eyes how it pints. That thar is the actool indyvidool\r\nplace; an this here’s the dozenth time it’s done it with me. O! it’s\r\nthar. I knowed it.”\r\n\r\nAs the rod fell, a thrill of tremendous excitement had passed through\r\nthe hearts of the boys, and their belief in its mystic properties was\r\nso strong, that it did not need any assurances from Captain Corbet to\r\nconfirm it. Yes, beyond a doubt, there it was, just beneath, a short\r\ndistance down--the wonderful, the mysterious, the alluring pot of gold.\r\n\r\nAt last the silence was broken by Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he, “what are we going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“The question is,” said Phil, “shall we dig it or not? I move that we\r\ndig it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Bruce, “we’ll dig it. There’s only one answer to that\r\nquestion. But when? The fellows are around here all the time.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to do it after dark,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Early in the morning would be the best time, I think,” said Bruce, a\r\nlittle anxiously.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart; “there’s only one time, and one hour, to dig money, and\r\nthat time is midnight, and the hour twelve sharp. If we’re going to dig\r\nfor a pot of money, we’ll have to do it up in proper shape.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Bruce, who still spoke in a rather anxious tone. “What\r\nare you talking about? Early morning is the time.”\r\n\r\n“Early morning!” said Bart; “why, man alive, we’ll want several hours,\r\nand it’ll be early morning before we’re done. If we begin at early\r\nmorning we can’t do anything. Some of the fellows are always up here\r\nbefore breakfast. No! From midnight to cock-crow, that’s the orthodox\r\ntime. Besides,” added Bart, mysteriously, “there are certain ceremonies\r\nwe’ll have to perform, that can only take place at night.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Bruce; “let’s tell the other fellows, and we’ll all dig\r\ntogether in broad day.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the other fellows! What in the world do you mean?” cried Bart.\r\n“Bruce Rawdon, are you crazy?”\r\n\r\nNo! Bruce Rawdon was not crazy. He was only a little superstitious, and\r\nhad a weakness with regard to ghosts. He had as brave and stout a heart\r\nas ever beat, with which to confront visible dangers and mortal enemies;\r\nbut his stout heart quailed at the fanciful terrors of the invisible.\r\nYet he saw that there was no help for it, and that he would have to\r\nchoose the midnight hour. So he very boldly made up his mind to face\r\nwhatever terrors the enterprise might have in store.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Bart, “we ourselves--we, the ‘B. O. W. C.’--must do\r\nit. It would be dishonor to invite the other boys. This belongs to\r\nus. We’re a secret and mystic order. We’ve never yet had anything in\r\nparticular to do. Now’s our time, and here’s our chance. We’re bound to\r\nget at that pot of gold. The captain, of course, must be with us, and\r\none other only; that is old Solomon. As Grand Panjandrum, he must be\r\nhere, and share our labors.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to get spades,” said Arthur. “I suppose Solomon can manage\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Spades?” said Bart; “I should think so, and fifty other things. We must\r\nhave lights. We’ll have to make a row of them around the edge of the\r\nhole.”\r\n\r\n“A row of them?” said Phil. “Nonsense! Two will do.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart. “You must always have a row of burning lamps around\r\nwhenever you dig for money. They must be kept burning too. One of us\r\nmust watch the lamps: woe to us if any one of them should go out! You\r\nsee it isn’t an ordinary work. It’s magic! Digging up a pot of gold must\r\nbe done carefully. Every buried pot of gold can only be got up according\r\nto a regular fashion. I’ve got a book that tells all about it--how many\r\nlights, how many spades, the proper time, and all that. Above all, we’ll\r\nhave to remember to keep as silent as death when we’re working, and\r\nnever speak one word. Why, I’ve heard of cases where they touched the\r\npot of gold, and just because they made a sort of cry of surprise, the\r\npot at once sunk down ever so much farther. And so they had to do it all\r\nover again.” Did Bart believe all this nonsense that he was talking? It\r\nis very difficult to say. He was not at all superstitious; that is to\r\nsay, his fancies never affected his actual life. He would walk through\r\na graveyard at midnight as readily as he would go along a road. At the\r\nsame time his brain contained such an odd jumble of wild fancies, and\r\nhis imagination was so vivid, that his ordinary common sense was lost\r\nsight of. He could follow the leadings of a very vivid imagination\r\nto the most absurd extent. If he had been really, in his heart,\r\nsuperstitious, he would have shrunk from the terrors of this enterprise.\r\nBut his real faith was not concerned at all. He was playing--very\r\nearnestly indeed, and with immense excitement, yet still he was only\r\nplaying--at digging for money, just as he had been playing at being a\r\nbandit, or a pirate. He was quite ready, therefore, to comply with any\r\namount of superstitious forms. The rest, also, were very much the same\r\nway, except Bruce. He alone looked upon the matter with anxiety; but he\r\nfought down his fear by an effort of pure courage.\r\n\r\nIt was only imagination, then; but still, so strong was their\r\nimagination, that it made the whole plan one of sober reality, and they\r\ndiscussed it as though it were so.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Bart, as he threw himself headlong into the excitement\r\nof the occasion--“you see, we’ve got to be careful. The pot of gold has\r\nbeen revealed by the mineral rod. If we had dug it up by accident,\r\nof course we could have got it without any trouble. But it has been\r\nrevealed by magic, and must be gained by the laws of magic. I’ve got\r\nthat Book of Magic, you know, and it tells all about it. Lights around,\r\nin number any multiple of three, or seven. Those are magic numbers. Our\r\nnumber inside the magic circle will be seven. That’s one reason why I\r\nwant old Solomon. We’ll have to keep silent, and not say a word. We must\r\nnot begin till midnight, and we cannot go on after cock-crow. O, we’ll\r\nmanage it. Hurrah for the ‘B. O. W. C’!”\r\n\r\nAnd so, after some further discussion, they decided to make the attempt\r\nthat night. It was to be the last night of the holidays, and was more\r\nconvenient than any other. Captain Corbet was to meet them with his rod\r\nand a spade. They were to come up with old Solomon, and all the other\r\nrequisites.\r\n\r\nWith these arrangements they parted solemnly from Captain Corbet, and\r\nwent back to the Academy, bowed down by the burden of a most tremendous\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_A Deed of Darkness.--The Money-diggers.--The dim Forest and the\r\nMidnight Scene.--Incantation assisted by Caesar, the Latin Grammar, and\r\nEuclid.--Sudden, startling, and terrific Interruption.--Flight of the\r\n“B. O. W. C.”--They rally again._\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDNIGHT came. Before that time the “B. O. W. C.” had prepared\r\nthemselves for the task before them. They were arrayed in the well-worn\r\nand rather muddy clothes in which they had made their memorable\r\nexpedition. Solomon was with them, dressed in his robes of office. The\r\nvenerable Grand Panjandrum had gathered all the lanterns that he could\r\ncollect; but as these were only five in number, and as they wanted\r\ntwenty-one, there had been some difficulty. This had, at length, been\r\nremedied by means of baskets, pails, and tin kettles; for it was thought\r\nthat by putting a candle in a pail, or something of that sort, it would\r\nbe protected from the wind. Solomon also was provided with matches,\r\nso as to kindle the light at once if it should be blown out; and Bart\r\ntried, in the most solemn manner, to impress upon him the necessity of\r\nwatchfulness. It was Solomon’s duty to watch the lights, and nothing\r\nelse; the others were to dig. Besides the pails, pots, lanterns,\r\ncandlesticks, and tin kettles, they carried a pickaxe, four spades,\r\nand the Bust,--which last was taken in order to add still more to the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion,--and after distributing this miscellaneous\r\nload as equally as possible among the multitude, they at length set out.\r\n\r\nThe Academy was all silent, and all were hushed in the depths of\r\nslumber; so they were able to steal forth unobserved, and make their way\r\nto the “Old French Orchard.”\r\n\r\nThe night was quite dark, and as they walked up the hill, the scene was\r\none of deep impressiveness. Overhead the sky was overcast, and a fresh\r\nbreeze, which was blowing, carried the thick clouds onward fast through\r\nthe sky. The moon was shining; but the dense clouds, as they drove past,\r\nobscured it at times; and the darkness that arose from this obscurity\r\nwas succeeded by a brighter light as the moon now and then shone forth.\r\nBefore them rose the solemn outline of the dark forest, gloomy and\r\nsilent, and the stillness that reigned there was not broken by a single\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nAfter walking some distance, they stopped, partly to rest, and partly\r\nto see if they were followed. As they turned, they beheld beneath them\r\na scene equally solemn, and far grander. Immediately below lay the dark\r\noutline of the Academy, and beyond this the scenery of Grand Pré; on the\r\nright extended the wide plains, now almost lost to view in the gloom of\r\nnight; on the left the Cornwallis River went winding afar, its bed full,\r\nits waters smooth and gleaming white amid the blackness that bordered\r\nit on either side. Overhead the sky arose, covered over with its\r\nwildly-drifting clouds, between which the moon seemed struggling to\r\nshine forth. Beneath lay the dark face of the Basin of Minas, which\r\nfaded away into the dimness of the opposite shore, while immediately in\r\nfront,--now, as always, the centre of the scene,--rose Blomidon,\r\nblack, frowning, sombre, as though this were the very centre from which\r\nemanated all the shadows of the night.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hill they met Captain Corbet, who had a spade on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“It’s rayther dark,” said he, in a pensive tone. “Ef I’d aknowed it was\r\nto be so dark, I’d postponed it.”\r\n\r\n“Dark!” said Bart, cheerily; “not a bit of it. It’s just right. We want\r\nit just this way. It’s the proper thing. You see, if it were moonlight,\r\nwe’d be discovered; but this darkness hides us, The moon peeps out now\r\nand then, just enough to make the darkness agreeable. This is just the\r\nway it ought to be.”\r\n\r\nThey moved on in silence towards the spot. Here, on three sides, the\r\nforest encircled them; below them was the deep, dark gully; and the\r\nshadows of the forest were so heavy, that nothing could be distinguished\r\nat a distance. Captain Corbet, usually talkative, was now silent and\r\npensive, and uttered an occasional sigh. As for Solomon, he did not say\r\none word. The whole party stood for a moment in silence, looking into\r\nthe cellar.\r\n\r\n“Come, boys,” said Bart, at length, “hurry up. The first thing we’ve got\r\nto do is to make the arrangements. We must arrange the lamps.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, they all proceeded to put down their lanterns, pots,\r\nkettles, pails, and baskets, around the cellar, so as to encircle it.\r\nInside each of the pots, kettles, pails, and baskets, a candle was put,\r\nwhile the Bust was placed at the end of the cellar nearest the wood.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Bart, “let’s all go into the cellar, and Solomon will light\r\nthe candles.”\r\n\r\nThey went into the cellar; but Solomon showed so much clumsiness in\r\nlighting them, that Bart had to do it. This was soon accomplished. The\r\nsurrounding forest sheltered them from the wind, and the lights did not\r\nflicker very much, except at times when an occasional puff stronger than\r\nusual would be felt. Once a light was blown out; but Bart lighted it\r\nagain, and then they all burned very well.\r\n\r\nSo there they stood, in the cellar, with the circle of lights around\r\nthem, under a dark sky, at the midnight hour.\r\n\r\n“I feel solemn,” said Captain Corbet, after a long silence; “I feel\r\ndeeply solemn.”\r\n\r\n“Solemn!” said Bart; “of course you do; so say we all of us. Why\r\nshouldn’t we?”\r\n\r\n“I feel,” said Captain Corbet, “a kind of pinin feelin--a longin and a\r\nhankerin after the babby.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, all right,” said Bart; “never mind the baby just now.”\r\n\r\n“But I feel,” said Captain Corbet, in a voice of exceeding\r\nmournfnlness--“I feel as though I’d orter jine the infant.”\r\n\r\n“O, never mind your feelings,” said Bart. “Have you got your mineral\r\nrod?”\r\n\r\n“I hev.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; try it.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rayther not. I--I--Couldn’t we postpone this here? It’s so solemn!”\r\n\r\n“Postpone it! Why, man, what are you thinking of? Postpone it! Nonsense!\r\nThink of your baby. Postpone it! And you pretend to be a father!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet drew a long sigh.\r\n\r\n“I feel,” said he, “rayther uncomfortable here;” and he pressed his hand\r\nagainst his manly bosom.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Bart. “Come; try the mineral rod.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet took the rod, and tried to balance it on his finger; but\r\nhis hand trembled so that it at once fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe boys gave a cry of delight. He had been standing, as before, in the\r\nmiddle of the cellar, and the rod fell in the former place.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of doubt about it!” cried Phil. “There it goes again! Come,\r\nlet’s go to work, boys.”\r\n\r\n“But we must have some ceremonies,” said Bart. “It would never do to\r\nbegin to dig without something.”\r\n\r\n“So I say,” remarked Captain Corbet, feebly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Solomon had been standing in his robes, a little apart,\r\nlooking nervously around.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Solomon!” cried Bart.\r\n\r\nSolomon gave a start.\r\n\r\n“Ya--ya--yas, sr.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not watching the lights.”\r\n\r\n“Ya--yasr.”\r\n\r\n“That basket has fallen.”\r\n\r\n“Ya, yasr,” said Solomon, whose teeth seemed to be chattering, and who\r\nseemed quite out of his senses.\r\n\r\nBart walked up to him, and saw at a glance how it was.\r\n\r\n“Why, old Solomon,” said he, gently, “you’re not frightened--are\r\nyou? It’s only our nonsense. Come, Grand Panjandrum, don’t take it\r\nin earnest. It’s all humbug, you know,” he added, dropping his voice.\r\n“Between you and me, we none of us take it in earnest. Come, you keep\r\nthe lamps burning, and be the Grand Panjandrum.”\r\n\r\nAt this a little of Solomon’s confidence was restored. He ventured to\r\nthe edge of the cellar, and lifted up the basket in time to save it from\r\nburning up; but scarce had he done this than he retreated; the gloom,\r\nthe darkness, the magic ceremonies, were too awful.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Tom, “let’s begin the ceremonies.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet gave another sigh.\r\n\r\n“I feel dreadful anxious,” said he, “about the infant; I’m afeard\r\nsomethins happened; I feel as if I’d orter be to hum.”\r\n\r\n“All right, captain,” said Bart; “we’ll all be home before long, and\r\nwith the _pot of gold_, you know. Come, cheer up, for the ceremonies are\r\ngoing to begin.”\r\n\r\n“See here, now,” said Captain Corbet. “This here’s a solemn occasion. I\r\nfeel solemn. It’s awful dark. We don’t know what’s buried here, or what\r\nwill happen; so let’s don’t have any heathen ceremonies.”\r\n\r\n“O, the ceremonies are not heathen,” said Bart. “Each of us is going to\r\nmake an incantation in the most solemn language that we can think of;\r\nso, boys, begin.”\r\n\r\n“The most solemn thing that I can think of,” said Phil, “is English\r\nhistory; so here goes.” And stretching forth his hand solemnly, he said,\r\nin a whining voice, like a boy reciting a lesson:--\r\n\r\n“_Britain was very little known to the rest of the world before the time\r\nof the Romans. The coasts opposite Gaul were frequented by merchants,\r\nwho traded thither for such commodities as the natives were able to\r\nproduce_.”\r\n\r\n“The most solemn thing, to me,” said Tom, “is Euclid.” And then he\r\nadded in the same tone, “_The square described on the hypothenuse of a\r\nright-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares described on\r\nthe other two sides of the same._”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Arthur, “find Arnold’s Latin Exercises the worst. The most\r\nsolemn thing for an invocation is,--’\r\n\r\n“_In temporibus Ciceronis Galli retinuerunt barbaram consuetudinem\r\nexcercendæ virtutis omni occasione. Balbus odifcabat murum!_”\r\n\r\n“I,” said Bruce, “have something far more solemn.” And stretching out\r\nhis hand, he said, in a loud, firm voice,--\r\n\r\n“_Dignus, indignus, content us, proditus, captus, and fretus,\r\nalso natus, satus, ortus, editus, and the like, govern\r\nthe--hem--nominative--no--the vocative--no--the ablative--all the\r\nsame._”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Bart, “the most solemn thing, to me, is Cæsar. The\r\nway they teach it here makes it a concentration of all the worst horrors\r\nof the Grammar, and Arnold, and History, with the additional horrors of\r\nan exact translation. O, brethren of the ‘B. O. W. C.,’ won’t you join\r\nwith me in saying,--\r\n\r\n“_Gallia est omnis divisa in partes très, quarum unam incolunt Belgo,\r\naliam Aquitani, tertiam, qui ipsorum lingua Celto, nostra Galli\r\nappellantur. Hi omnes lingua, institutis, legibus, inter se differunt.\r\nGallos ab Aquitanis Garumna_”\r\n\r\n“Here!” cried Captain Corbet, suddenly interrupting Bart; “I can’t stand\r\nthis any longer. It’s downwright heathenism--all that outlandish heathen\r\nstuff! Do ye mean to temp fate? Bewar, young sirs! It’s dangerous!\r\n’Tain’t safe to stand here, at midnight, over a Frenchman’s bones, and\r\njabber French at him.”\r\n\r\n“French?” said Bart. “It’s not French.”\r\n\r\n“That ain’t the pint,” said Captain Corbet, who had worked himself up\r\ninto considerable excitement. “The pint is air it English? No, _sir_.\r\nDoes any Christian onderstand sich? No, _sir_. We hain’t got no business\r\nwith sich.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s Latin,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Wuss and wuss,” said Captain Corbet. “I take my stand by the\r\npatriarchs, the prophets, and the postles. Did they jabber Latin? No,\r\nsir. They were satisfied with good honest English. It was a solemn time\r\nwith them thar. English did for them. So, on this solemn occasion, let\r\nus talk English, or forever after hold our peaces.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what shall we do?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Do?” said Captain Corbet; “why, do somethin solemn. I should like--” he\r\nadded, mildly. “Ef you could, it would be kind o’ sewthin ef you could\r\nsing a hime.”\r\n\r\n“A hymn,” said Bart; “certainly.” Now, Bart had a quick talent for\r\nmaking up jingling rhymes; so he immediately improvised the following,\r\nwhich he gave out, two lines at a time, to be sung by the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n It was sung to the mournful, the solemn, the venerable, and the very\r\nappropriate tune, known as “Rousseau’s Dream.”\r\n\r\n                   “Why did we deprive the Frenchman\r\n\r\n                        Of his lands against his will,\r\n\r\n                   Take possession of his marshes,\r\n\r\n                        Raise a school-house on the hill?\r\n\r\n                   “‘Twas a foolish self-deceiving\r\n\r\n                        By such tricks to hope for gain;\r\n\r\n                   All that ever comes by thieving\r\n\r\n                        Turns to sorrow, care, and pain.\r\n\r\n                   “Ours is now the retribution;\r\n\r\n                        See the fate that falls on us--\r\n\r\n                   Awful tasks in Greek and Latin,\r\n\r\n                        Algebra, and Calculus!\r\n\r\n                   “Yet for all the tribulation\r\n\r\n                        Which the morrow must behold,\r\n\r\n                   We may find alleviation\r\n\r\n                        In the Frenchman’s _pot of gold!_”\r\n\r\nThe wailing notes of the tune rose up into the dark night, and the\r\ntones, as they were dolefully droned out by the “B. O. W. C.,” died away\r\nin the dim forest around.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet gave a long sigh as they ended. “Solemner and solemner!”\r\n he slowly ejaculated. “I wish the biz was over.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “the way to have it over is to begin as soon as\r\npossible. But remember this, all of you: after the first stroke of spade\r\nor pickaxe, not a word must be spoken--not a word--not one; no matter\r\nwhat may happen; no matter how surprised, astonished, terrified,\r\nhorrified, mystified, or scarified we may be. Mum’s the word; any other\r\nword will break the spell; and then, where are we? And you, Solomon,\r\nmind the lights! Don’t you dare to let one of them go out: as you value\r\nyour life, keep them going. Above all, mind that tin kettle in the\r\ncorner; the wick is bad, and it’s flaring away at a tremendous rate. And\r\ndon’t let the baskets upset. Have you got your matches?”\r\n\r\n“Ya--yasr,” said Solomon, whose teeth were now chattering again, and who\r\nlooked with utter horror at the row of lights which he was ordered to\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n“Will you take the pickaxe, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, in a faint voice, “I hardly know; perhaps\r\nyou’d better dig, an I’ll go over to the fence, and see that no one\r\ncomes.”\r\n\r\n“Go over to the fence!” cried Bart. “What! go out through that row of\r\nlights? and after our incantations? Why, Captain Corbet! Don’t you think\r\nof anything of the kind. We are seven. It’s a mystic number. You must\r\nstay with us.” Captain Corbet heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “I’ll take one of the spades.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the pickaxe,” said Bruce. “Very well,” said Bart; “you\r\nbegin. Stir up the earth, and we’ll all dig. But after the first stroke,\r\nremember--not one word!”\r\n\r\nBruce then seized the pickaxe with nervous energy, and raising it, he\r\nhurled it into the ground. As it struck, Solomon shuddered, and clasped\r\nhis hands. Captain Corbet stepped back, and looked wildly around. Again\r\nand again Bruce wielded the pickaxe, dashing it into the earth with\r\npowerful blows, and then wrenching it so as to pry up the sods. The\r\nothers looked on in silence. At length he had loosened the earth all\r\nabout, and to a considerable depth. After this he stood back, and the\r\nother boys went to work with their spades. Bruce waited for a little\r\ntime, and then, dropping the pickaxe, he seized a spade, and plunged it\r\ninto the ground, and rapidly threw up the soil, doing as much work as\r\nany two of the others.\r\n\r\nFor some time they worked thus. The silence was profound, being only\r\nbroken by the clash of the spades against the stones, and the hard\r\nbreathing of the boys. At last they hod dug up all the earth that\r\nhad been loosened by Bruce, and the hard soil began to present an\r\ninsuperable barrier to the progress of the spades. Seeing this, Bruce\r\nseized the pickaxe once more, and again hurled it with vigorous blows\r\ninto the ground, loosening the earth all around. At last, as he flung\r\nit down with all his force, it struck against something which gave so\r\npeculiar a sound that the boys all started, and caught one another’s\r\narms, and looked at one another in the dim moonlight, each trying to see\r\nthe face of the other. Bruce stopped for an instant, and then, swinging\r\nthe pickaxe again over his head, he dashed it down with all his force.\r\nAgain it struck that hard substance under ground, and again there was\r\nthat peculiar sound. It was a sound that could not be mistaken. It was\r\nnot such a sound as would be given by a stone, or by a stick of timber;\r\nit was something very different. It was hard, ringing,--metallic! And as\r\nthat sound struck upon the ears of the “B. O. W. C.” there was but one\r\nthought, a thought which came simultaneously to the minds of all--the\r\nthought that Bruce’s pickaxe had reached the buried treasure. But the\r\npot of gold now became to their imaginations an iron chest filled with\r\ncoin, and it was against this iron chest that the pickaxe had struck,\r\nand it was this iron chest which had given forth the sound.\r\n\r\nYet so schooled were they, so determined upon success, that even\r\nthe immensity of such a sensation could not make them forget their\r\nself-imposed silence. Not one word was spoken. They felt, they thought,\r\nbut they did not speak.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bruce flung down the pickaxe, and seized his spade. At once\r\nall the others rushed forward to join in the task. Bruce was first; his\r\nspade was plunged deep into the loosened earth. Bight and left it was\r\nflung. The spades of the others were plunged in also. All of them were\r\ndigging wildly and furiously, and panting heavily with their exertion\r\nand their excitement. Each one had felt his spade strike and grate\r\nagainst that hard metallic substance which the pickaxe had struck, and\r\nwhich they now fully believed to be the pot of gold. Each one was in\r\nthe full swing of eager expectation, when suddenly there came an awful\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nThey might have been digging five minutes, or an hour; they could never\r\ntell exactly. Afterwards, when they talked it over, and compared one\r\nanother’s impressions, they could not come to any decision, for all\r\nidea of time had been lost. Engaged in their work, they took no note of\r\nminutes or hours. But while they were working Captain Corbet had stood\r\naloof; he held a spade in his listless hands, but he did not use it. He\r\nwas looking on nervously, and with a pale face, and his thoughts were\r\nsuch as cannot be described. Solomon also stood, with trembling frame\r\nand chattering teeth, a prey to superstitious terror. To Solomon had\r\nbeen committed the care of the lights; yet he did not dare to venture\r\nnear them. For that matter, he did not dare even look at them. His gaze\r\nwas fixed on the boys, while at times his eyes would roll fearfully over\r\nthe dark outline of those dim and sombre woods whose shadows lowered\r\ngloomily before him.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the situation,--the boys busy and excited; Captain\r\nCorbet nervous, and idle, and fearful; Solomon trembling from head to\r\nfoot, and overcome with a thousand wild and superstitious fancies,--when\r\nsuddenly, close beside them, outside of the row of lights, just as\r\ntheir spades struck the metallic substance before mentioned,--suddenly,\r\ninstantaneously, and without the slightest warning, there arose a sharp,\r\na fearful, a terrible uproar; something midway between a shriek and a\r\npeal of thunder; a roar, in fact, so hideous, so wild, so unparalleled\r\nin its horrid accompaniments, that it shook the boldest heart in that\r\nsmall but bold company. It rose on high; it seemed to fill all the air;\r\nand its awful echoes prolonged themselves afar through the darkness of\r\nthe midnight scene.\r\n\r\nThe boys started back from the hole; their spades dropped from their\r\nhands. They saw about half of the lights extinguished, and amid the\r\ngloom they could perceive two figures rushing in mad haste away from the\r\nspot. A panic seized upon them. Before a panic the stoutest heart is\r\nas weak as water. Even the “B. O. W. C.” yielded to its influence. They\r\nshrank back, they retreated, they passed the line of flickering lights.\r\n\r\nThey fled!\r\n\r\nAway, away! back from this terrible place, back towards the Academy. So\r\nfled the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n\r\nFirst of all the fugitives was Solomon.\r\n\r\nHe had been nearly frightened out of his wits long before. These\r\nproceedings, half in joke, had been no joke to him. In spite of Bart’s\r\nassurances he had stood a trembling spectator, neglectful of his duty.\r\nThe wind had blown out the lights one by one. Far from lighting\r\nthem again, he had not even watched them. Every moment his fear had\r\nincreased, until at last his limbs were almost paralyzed with terror.\r\nBut at length, when that awful roar had arisen, his stupor was\r\ndispelled. An overmastering horror had seized him. He burst through\r\nthe line of lights; he fled across the field; he ran, with his official\r\nrobes streaming behind him, towards the Academy. Off went his hat: he\r\nheeded it not; he kept on his way. He reached the door of the house; he\r\nburst in. Up the stairs, and up another flight, and up another flight,\r\nand yet another--so he ran, until at last he reached his room. Arriving\r\nhere, he banged to the door, and moved his bedstead against it,\r\nand heaped upon the bedstead his trunk, his chairs, his table, his\r\nlooking-glass, his boots, his washstand, and every movable in the room.\r\nThen tearing off the bedclothes, he rolled himself up in them, and\r\ncrouching down in a corner of the room, he lay there sleepless and\r\ntrembling till daybreak.\r\n\r\nNor was Solomon the only fugitive. Scarcely had he bounded away in his\r\nheadlong flight before Captain Corbet, with a cry of “O, my babby!”\r\n plunged after him, through the line of lights into the gloom that\r\nsurrounded the ill-omened spot.\r\n\r\nAnd there, over that track which saw the college gown of Solomon and the\r\ncoat tails of Captain Corbet streaming in the wind, there, fast and far,\r\nin wild confusion, in headlong panic, fled the “B. O. W. C.” Who ran\r\nfirst, and who came last, matters not. I certainly will never tell.\r\nEnough is it for me to say that they RAN! Such is the power of Panic.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as was that panic, it did not last long; and by the time\r\nthey reached the edge of the playground on the crest of the hill, they\r\nall slackened their pace and stopped by mutual consent. There they stood\r\nin silence for some time, looking back at the place from which they had\r\nfled, and where now a few lights were still flickering.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one great question in all their minds.\r\n\r\nWhat was It?\r\n\r\nBut this none of them could tell, and so they all kept silent.\r\n\r\nThat silence was at last broken by Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he, “what are we going to do now? Our shovels and\r\nlights are there; and, worst of all, our palladium---the bust. Solomon\r\nhas gone, and Captain Corbet; but we still remain. We’ve rallied; and\r\nnow what shall we do? Shall we retreat, or go back again to the hole?”\r\n\r\nBart spoke, and silence followed. Overhead the clouds swept wrathfully\r\nbefore the face of the moon, and all around’ rose the dim forest shades.\r\n\r\nIn front flickered and twinkled the feeble, fitful lights. And there, by\r\nthose lights, was That, whatever it was, from which they had fled.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, at any rate,” said Bruce, in a harsh,\r\nconstrained voice; “_I’ll go back to that hole, if I die for it_.”\r\n\r\n“You!” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruce, standing with his fists close clinched, and his brow\r\ndarkly frowning; “yes, I; you fellows may come or stay, just as you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\nA man’s courage must be measured from his own idea of danger. A couple\r\nof hundred years ago many acts were brave which to-day are commonplace.\r\nTo defy the superstitions of the age may be a sign of transcendent\r\ncourage. Now, of all these boys Bruce was by far the most superstitious;\r\nyet he was the first who offered to go back to face _That_ from which\r\nthey had all fled. It was an effort of pure pluck. It was a grand recoil\r\nfrom the superstitious timidity of his weaker self. Buoyed up by his\r\nlofty pride and sense of shame, he crushed down the fear that rose\r\nwithin him, and his very superstition made his act all the more\r\ncourageous. And as he spoke those last words, before the others had time\r\nto say anything in reply, he turned abruptly, and strode back with firm\r\nsteps towards the cellar. So he stalked off, steeling his shaking nerves\r\nand rousing up the resources of his lofty nature. By that victory over\r\nthe flesh he grew calm, and walked steadily back into the dark, ready\r\nto encounter any danger that might be lingering there--an example of\r\nsplendid courage and conquest over fear.\r\n\r\nBut he did not long walk alone. Before he had taken a dozen steps the\r\nothers were with him, and in a short time they were all in the hole\r\nagain. Bart proceeded to light the extinguished candles, while Bruce\r\nquietly picked up the spades, assisted by the other boys. Soon all the\r\nlights were burning, and Bart joined the little knot of boys who were\r\nstanding in the centre of the cellar.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, coolly, “the old question is before us--What are we to\r\ndo now? Shall we stay here and dig, or shall we go home and go to bed?\r\nFor my part, if you wish to dig I’ll dig; but at the same time I think\r\nwe’d better retire, taking our things with us, and postpone our digging\r\ntill another time.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t say anything about it,” said Bruce. “I’ll do either. One thing,\r\nhowever, I promise not to do; whatever happens, I won’t run again.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Arthur, “there’s no use talking about digging any\r\nmore to-night. It was all very well while we were in the humor. It was\r\nall fun; but the fun has gone; we’ve disgraced ourselves. What _That_\r\nwas I don’t pretend to know; but it may have been a trick. If so, we’re\r\nwatched. And I don’t think any of us feel inclined to dig here with some\r\nof the other fellows giggling at us from among the trees.”\r\n\r\n“It may have been the Gaspereaugians,” said Phil.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a heavy sigh was heard, not far away.\r\n\r\n“Hu-s-s-s-s-s-s-h!” said Bart; “what’s that?”\r\n\r\n“That? One of the cows,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, boys,” said Phil; “some of the fellows have got\r\nwind of our plan, and have been playing this trick on us. If so, we’ll\r\nnever hear the end of it.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather have our fellows do it than the Gas-pereaugians,” said Bart,\r\nsolemnly. “What a pity we didn’t think of this before we began! We’d not\r\nhave been taken so by surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Phil, “I believe it was some trick; but how any human\r\nbeings could contrive to make such an unearthly noise, such a mixture\r\nof thunder, and howling, and screeching, I cannot for the life of me\r\nimagine.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Bruce, “it may _not_ have been a trick. It may have been\r\nsomething which ought to make us afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Tom, “that we’ll find out all about it yet. Let us\r\nonly keep dark, say nothing, and keep our eyes and ears open. We’ll find\r\nit out some time.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Arthur, “I suppose we’re all out of the humor for digging.\r\nIf so, suppose we smooth over this hole; and then we can take away our\r\nlights and spades. My only idea in coming back was to get the things and\r\ndestroy all traces of our digging.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Bruce, seizing a spade.\r\n\r\nThe other boys did the same, and soon the hole was filled up. They\r\nplaced the sods over it as neatly as they could, and though the soil\r\nbore marks of disturbance, yet they were not conspicuous enough to\r\nexcite particular attention.\r\n\r\nThen they proceeded to gather up the things so as to carry them away. In\r\nthe midst of this there came a voice out of the darkness, a long, loud,\r\nshrill voice,--a voice of painful, eager, anxious inquiry.\r\n\r\n“B-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ys! O, b-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ys!”\r\n\r\n“It’s Captain Corbet!” cried Bart. “Hallo-o-o-o-o!” he shouted. “All\r\nri-i-i-i-i-i-ght! We-e-e-’re h-e-e-e-re! All sa-a-a-a-a-a-afe! Come\r\nalo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped shouting then, and they all listened attentively. Soon they\r\nheard footsteps approaching, and before long they saw emerging from the\r\ngloom the familiar form and the reverend features of Captain Corbet. He\r\ncame down into the hole, and after giving a furtive look all around, he\r\nsaid,--“So you’ve ben a toughin of it out, hev you? Wal, wal, wal!”\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” said Bart; “we all ran as fast as we could.”\r\n\r\n“You did!” cried Captain Corbet, while a gleam of joy illuminated his\r\nvenerable face. “You ran! What actilly? Not railly?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we all ran; and stopped at the edge of the hill, and then, seeing\r\nnothing, we came back to get the things.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “that’s more’n I’d hev done. I’m terewly\r\nrejiced to find that you clar’d out, sence it makes me not so ’shamed\r\no’ myself; but I wonder at your comin back, I do railly. It was a\r\nvice,” he continued, solemnly, “a vice o’ warnin. Hark! from the tombs\r\na doleful sound! But it’s all right now. Sence you’ve ben an stopped\r\nup the hole, I ain’t afeard any more. But, boys,”--and he regarded them\r\nwith a face full of awe,--“boys, let that vice be a warnin. Don’t you\r\never go a diggin any more for a pot of gold. I give up that thar biz\r\nnow, and forevermore. See here, and bar witness, all.”\r\n\r\nSaying this Captain Corbet took his mineral rod with both hands, and\r\nsnapped it across his knee; then, letting the fragments fall on the\r\nground, he put his feet over them.\r\n\r\n“Thar, that’s done! I got that thar rod from a demon in human form,” he\r\nsaid. “It was old Zeke; I bought it from him. He showed me how to use\r\nit. It was not myself, boys. Old Corbet don’t want money; it was the\r\nbabby. That pereshus infant demanded my parential care. I wanted to heap\r\nup wealth for his sake. But it’s all over. That vice has been a warnin.\r\nWhile diggin here, I pined arter the babby; an when that vice come, a\r\nsoundin like thunder in my ears, I fe-led. I cut like lightnin across\r\nthe fields, an got to my own hum. But when I got thar I thought o’\r\nyouns. I couldn’t go in to see my babby, and leave you here in danger.\r\nSo I come back; an here we air again, all safe, at last. An the infant’s\r\nsafe to hum; an the rod’s broke forevermore; an my dreams of gold hev\r\nben therrown like dumb idols to the moulds and tew the bats,--to delude\r\nme no more forever. That’s so; an thar you hev it; an I remain yours\r\ntill death shall us part.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, the money-diggers gathered up all their\r\npots, and kettles, and pans, and spades, and pickaxes, and shovels, and\r\nhoes, and candles, and lanterns, and finally the Bust. These they bore\r\naway, and bidding an affectionate adieu to Captain Corbet, they went to\r\nthe Academy, and succeeded in reaching their rooms unobserved.\r\n\r\nAnd during all the time that they lingered in the cellar there was no\r\nrepetition of that sound, nor was there any interruption whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Wonders of the upper Air.--Mr. Long calls upon the Boys for\r\nHelp.--All Hands at hard Labor.--Captain Corbet on a Fence.--The\r\nAntelope comes to Grief.--Captain Corbet in the Grasp of the Law. Mr.\r\nLong to the Rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning came. It was a glorious sunrise. Nowhere out of Italy,\r\nI think, can be seen such sunrises and sunsets as those of Grand Pré.\r\nAnd you may see all that can be presented by even Italy in every part\r\nof its varied outline--on the plain, on the mountain-top, or by\r\nthe sea-side; you may’ traverse the Apennines, or wander by the\r\nMediterranean shore, or look over the waste Campagna, and yet never\r\nfind anything that can surpass those atmospheric effects which may be\r\nwitnessed along the shores that surround the Basin of Minas. Here may be\r\nfound that which would fill the soul of the poet or artist--the dreamy\r\nhaze, the soft and voluptuous calm, the glory of the sunlit sky,\r\nthe terror of the storm, the majesty of giant cloud masses piled up\r\nconfusedly, the rainbow tints cast by the rising or setting sun over\r\ninnumerable clouds.\r\n\r\nThe sun now arose from out a congregated mass of clouds, and threw a\r\ndull red glow over all the east. Above the wide plains of Grand Pré\r\nthere hung dense exhalations which had risen through the night from\r\nthe dike lands, and were now waiting to be dissipated. The valley of\r\nCornwallis lay slumbrous and dreamy in a thin haze which rose above\r\nit, and in the distance the black outline of the North Mountain peered\r\nobscurely. The broad bosom of the Basin of Minas had a peculiar tinge,\r\nfor, seen through the land mist and the distant haze, it was perfectly\r\ncalm and unruffled, and the hue of its surface seemed milk-white; and\r\nthis milk-white flood lay embosomed amid shores of gray, which deepened\r\nas they came nearer into black. And here at this time, as always, the\r\ncentre of the scene, as much the controller of the Basin of Minas\r\nas Vesuvius is the monarch of the Bay of Naples,--black, frowning,\r\nindistinct,--Blomidon rose, and seemed to gather to himself the\r\nintensest shades of darkness. The fog from the Bay of Fundy projected\r\nitself through the Strait of Minas far into the Basin, while over the\r\ncrest of the giant cliff, piled up in yast confused masses, heap, over\r\nheap, like the mountains reared by the fabled Titans, there arose a\r\ntremendous accumulation of clouds.\r\n\r\nAt first all the east was red; and over the land mist, and over the hazy\r\nvalley, and over the milk-white sea, there came a dull glow, which made\r\nthe scene resemble some place that is illumined by the glare of some\r\nvast conflagration. But the moments passed, and the sun climbed higher,\r\nand the dull glow of the red changed to a more vivid hue. The glare of\r\nthat rising sun, still red, yet vivid, and penetrating, and more and\r\nmore luminous as it rose above the clouds, flung itself over all the\r\nscene. The long clouds that stretched over the east spread across the\r\nsky like bars of ruddy gold. A flame seemed to light up all the land\r\nmists that rolled over the dikes of Grand Pré. A luminous haze hung like\r\na mantle of glory over Cornwallis. The milk-white sea grew all tinged\r\nwith a brilliant pink, and the distant shores, once dark gray deepening\r\ninto black, now became purple. The form of Blomidon changed from its\r\nebon hue to a deep indigo, while the haze over its crest had the tinge\r\nof flame. Far overhead, as they rose piled up into the sky, the clouds\r\ncaught the lustre of that sunrise. They shimmered and quivered, as,\r\nblown by the wind, they rolled along, receiving every moment in a new\r\ndirection the rays of the sun; they grew from pale pink to ruddiness,\r\nand from ruddiness to vermilion, and from vermilion to the dazzle of\r\na golden lustre, till there arose before the view a heaped-up mass,\r\npresenting the reality of all that has ever been imagined of the\r\nsplendors of Cloud-land; an aerial scene, where deep down there lay a\r\ndull red foundation, on which arose a cloud-built pyramid of pink, of\r\nvermilion, and of gold.\r\n\r\nBut all these passed. These effects were only momentary. In an instant\r\neach shifting scene had vanished, leaving only the remembrance of its\r\nglory. The sun climbed higher, the land mists grew gray, the haze faded\r\nout, the sea surface became blue, Blomidon changed to dark olive, the\r\nclouds above lost all their splendor in a leaden color, and at last, as\r\nthe sun attained a greater height, it shone from a blue sky upon a blue\r\nsea, with its circle of green shores, from which fog, and mist, and\r\ncloud were all rapidly hurrying away.\r\n\r\nThe “B. O. W. C.” joined the company at the breakfast table that morning\r\nwith visible signs of weariness and exhaustion. They had been up too\r\nlate; they had worked too hard, at an unaccustomed labor; and they had\r\nbeen subject to a very strong excitement. They said nothing, however,\r\nand none of their schoolmates noticed anything peculiar about them. They\r\nwere very anxious to learn whether any of the boys had been concerned in\r\nthe trick which they believed had been played upon them; but the perfect\r\nunconsciousness as to the events of the past night which was evinced by\r\nall their companions showed most plainly that they, at least, could have\r\nhad nothing whatever to do with it. In order to make assurance doubly\r\nsure, they talked separately and individually with each of them, so as\r\nto see if there were any lurking signs of an acquaintance with their\r\nmidnight adventure. But the result of this examination confirmed the\r\nopinion which they had formed before, and they all concluded that if\r\nthere had been a trick, none of the boys of the school had anything to\r\ndo with it. One conclusion only remained--it must be the Gaspereaugians\r\n5\r\n\r\nNine o’clock was the hour for assembling in the class-room; but before\r\nthat hour Mr. Long appeared in the yard of the Academy, where most of\r\nthe boys were gathered, and collected together all those who had gone\r\nwith him on the late expedition. There was evidently something on his\r\nmind. The small boys could see this, and they all joined the throng,\r\ntill at length every boy in the place had assembled there.\r\n\r\nMr. Long’s business was soon explained. It was about that stone wall\r\nwhich he had caused to be appropriated to furnish ballast for the\r\nAntelope. He had heard that the owner of the wall had been vowing\r\nvengeance during their absence, and was extremely anxious to have it all\r\nreplaced. But the trouble was, he could not get any laborers. All the\r\nfarmers about were hard at work in their fields, and all the seafaring\r\nmen had gone to Boston with potatoes. He was therefore in a very awkward\r\nposition. So he had taken counsel with Dr. Porter, and with his consent\r\ndetermined to get the assistance of the boys. They had put the stones\r\nin very easily, and it seemed equally easy for them to take them all\r\nout again and replace them. Of course some reward would be needed as\r\na stimulus. In putting them in they had been stimulated by the hope of\r\ngoing on the expedition. Something equally attractive would be needed as\r\nan inducement for them to take them out. So Mr. Long and Dr. Porter had\r\nthought of something which would supply this required inducement, and\r\nthe former now appeared to make known the result to the boys.\r\n\r\nIt was this. He invited all the boys to come and help him in this work\r\nof unloading the ballast and replacing the stone wall, and promised\r\nthem, as a reward, the continuation of their holidays for the remainder\r\nof the week.\r\n\r\nAt this there was but one response. It came in the shape of a wild\r\nhurrah. Unload the vessel? Yes, and a dozen vessels. Holidays? more hoik\r\ndays? What wouldn’t they do to get them? How lucky it was that all the\r\nfarm laborers were hard at work, and all the sailors were off to Boston!\r\nWhat a valuable and interesting plant was the potato, which had thus\r\nthrown in their way the chance to earn holidays for themselves! So\r\nhurrah, boys! and hurrah! again! Stone walls? Build them? Why, we’ll\r\nbuild a dozen to get more holidays!\r\n\r\nSo they thought, and so they talked, and so they shouted, and thus\r\nconvinced Mr. Long of the success of his experiment. Not only all of the\r\nlate voyageurs accompanied him to the Antelope, but all the small boys\r\nalso, every one of them; in fact, the whole school went down, every one\r\neager to do something, so as to earn his holiday. It was not labor--it\r\nwas a frolic. It was fun for them; and it was singular to see the effect\r\nwhich this proposal produced upon the “B. O. W. C.” Before this they\r\nhad been wearied, exhausted, fagged out, in fact, used up, by their\r\nlaborious exertions and the tremendous excitement of the past night,\r\ntogether with the loss of their usual sleep. But now, at the prospect of\r\nmore holidays, they roused themselves; all their energies were at once\r\nexcited; they forgot in a moment all their past exertions, with the\r\nsleeplessness that had resulted, and felt as much vigor as though they\r\nhad slept for ten hours, instead of five.\r\n\r\nDown they all went, therefore, to where the Antelope lay; and the\r\nprocession, although not quite so grotesque as on a former occasion, was\r\nstill sufficiently striking to attract considerable attention from the\r\nvillagers. First of all went Mr. Long, alone; for Mr. Simmops did not\r\nfeel inclined to go. He was busy preparing his lessons for the\r\nboys. After the leader followed the elder boys, who had been on the\r\nexpedition; then came a confused crowd of small boys. They didn’t walk\r\nin military order exactly; in fact, they had no order at all, and if\r\nit must be confessed, they were somewhat disorderly; at any rate, they\r\nbeguiled that inarch by playing at leap-frog, or riding on one another’s\r\nbacks, or doing something else equally striking to the village mind, all\r\nthe way down.\r\n\r\nAt last they arrived at the scene of action. Mr. Long put Bruce and\r\nJiggins, who were the largest boys in the school, into the hold of the\r\nschooner, to lift out the stones, and then ranged a double line of boys,\r\nof all sizes, between the schooner and the place where the stone wall\r\nhad formerly been.\r\n\r\nHe then took Arthur, Billymack, Pat, and Bart as his assistants,\r\nand stood by the wall to build it up again with the stones from the\r\nAntelope. He himself worked with his own hands in building up the wall,\r\nand directed his assistants. There were a great many stones; but, then,\r\nthere were a great many hands at work; and so, at last, after violent\r\nlabor, which, however, was all the time cheered and alleviated by the\r\nprospect of additional holidays, the work was completed. Once more the\r\nstone wall arose, quite as good as it had been before, and, in fact,\r\neven better, on the spot whence it had been taken; and so vigorously\r\nhad the nimble hands worked, and so skilfully had Mr. Long and his\r\nassistants piled up the stones, that they were able to go back to the\r\nhills to take their dinner, with the happy consciousness,--first, that\r\nthey had earned holidays for the remainder of the week; and secondly,\r\nthat the stone wall was a far better one, as they had built it, than it\r\nhad been when it was taken away. So Mr. Long said, as he expressed his\r\nthanks for their labors, and his deep gratification at the fair result;\r\nand so they all felt as they looked at that wall, which, though built\r\nby the hands of amateurs, was still far better in every respect than the\r\nolder portions, the work of other hands, that stood beside it.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the day the boys were all too wearied to engage in\r\nany play. The “B. O. W. C.,” in particular, were exhausted from their\r\ndouble toil. They spent the afternoon together in Bart’s room, talking\r\nover the events of that memorable evening when they had dug for money.\r\nSolomon, since then, had kept out of sight. They themselves did not feel\r\nat all inclined to reproach him. Their thoughts did not refer at all to\r\nhim, nor to Captain Corbet, but rather to that unearthly noise which had\r\ndriven them to a disgraceful flight. Most of them thought that it was\r\na trick of the Gaspereaugians. Bruce alone rejected this theory, and\r\nplainly stated his belief that it was something supernatural. If it had\r\nbeen the Gaspereaugians, he argued, would they have left us unmolested\r\nafter we went back? No. It was because we did not dig that we were let\r\nalone. If we had begun to dig again, and if we had struck that metallic\r\nbox again, then we should have heard that roar, and something a good\r\ndeal worse.\r\n\r\nBut this was only Bruce’s opinion; none of the others held it. They were\r\nconvinced that it was the trick of the Gaspereaugians, and were eager\r\nto find ont some way of retaliating on their enemies; but they could not\r\nimagine any way in which to do it.\r\n\r\nThe hours of the day passed on, and late in the afternoon they went out\r\nfor a walk. Not having any particular route in view, they strolled down\r\nthrough the village, and very naturally directed their steps towards Mud\r\nCreek, so as to take another look at the Antelope, and particularly at\r\nthat stone fence which had cost them so much labor, and blistered all\r\nthe hands in the school.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the spot a startling sight met their eyes. There, perched\r\nupon the very stone wall which they had assisted to build, with his arms\r\nfolded round his knees, and his chin pressed upon the same, with\r\nhis whole figure drawn up into the smallest compass into which it is\r\npossible for the human frame to gather itself, they saw a familiar\r\nshape, the sight of which, as they saw it in such an attitude, startled\r\nthem extremely.\r\n\r\nIt was no other than Captain Corbet. Drawn up thus, folding thus his\r\nknees with his arms, leaning thus his chin upon his knees, he came\r\nbefore their startled vision; but he himself was quite unconscious of\r\ntheir presence. His face was turned to the scene which presented itself\r\nbefore him, and his eyes were fixed upon that scene to the exclusion of\r\nall other things; and they, as they came up behind him, saw gradually\r\nwhat that scene was.\r\n\r\nSince they had been there last, the tide had reached its height, and\r\nhad fallen. Mud Creek now lay before them perfectly empty of water, and\r\npresenting to their view an expanse of nothing else except soft, slimy,\r\nslippery, oleaginous mud, which now spread away in an impassable gulf,\r\nand showed the justice and the truth of that uneuphonious name. But the\r\nvast abyss of soft, slimy, and oleaginous mud, and the wide\r\nimpassable valley composed thereof, and the rise and the fall of these\r\nextraordinary tides, were not the attractions which riveted the gaze of\r\nCaptain Corbet, and the eyes of the boys of the “B. O. W. C.,” as they\r\ndrew nearer. It was something far different--something, in fact, which\r\ntouched them all, in common, with a deep feeling of sorrow,--a feeling\r\nwhich was strong enough to make Captain Corbet unconscious of the\r\npresence of any except himself, and to make the boys stop short in their\r\nadvance, and look on in deep but mournful silence.\r\n\r\nFor there, just before them, and just before the entranced gaze of\r\nCaptain Corbet, lay the Antelope. She was lying on her side, down the\r\nsteep slope of mud, as though with the falling tide she had rolled over\r\nto her ruin and destruction. There she lay, with her side buried deep in\r\nthe soft mud, her masts pointing downwards; buried there, and so firmly\r\nfixed in that burial-place, that the next rising tide would only seem to\r\ncomplete her hopeless ruin. There she lay, doomed and devoted to\r\ndestruction,--the dear old Antelope, which had carried them safely\r\nthrough all their late adventures, and around which so many imperishable\r\nmemories had fastened themselves. To these boys of the “B. O. W. C.,”\r\n who thus saw it in the peril of its last agonies, the Antelope was not a\r\ncommon schooner. It had carried them safely through adventures which\r\nwere never to be forgotten. In it they had cruised over Minas Basin,\r\nthey had visited the Five Islands, they had landed at Pratt’s Cove: in\r\nit they had drifted over the wide seas, they had run ashore, they had\r\nencountered perils without number; in it they had known joy and sorrow,\r\nplenty and famine, hope and despair; and this was the end--to see the\r\ndear old tub upset on the wrong side, and lying buried in Mud Creek\r\nbefore their eyes, awaiting its inevitable fate.\r\n\r\n“O, Captain Corbet!” cried Bart, who hurried up first to the figure on\r\nthe stone wall. “O, Captain Corbet! Can nothing be done to save her?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet turned his face, and looked mildly, yet calmly upon the\r\nboys. His calmness extended itself to them, and they thought that it was\r\nthe calmness of hope. In a moment their sorrow over the Antelope passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBut the words of Captain Corbet did not tend to inspire hope.\r\n\r\nNo shook his venerable head with deep solemnity.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, “nothen ken be done. You see, I hurried home to see the\r\nbabby, an I didn’t fasten her right. She stood one tide all night, but\r\nit was on’y by chance. This here tide to-day has done for her. I’d orter\r\nhev tied her up proper--but it was all the babby. I clar’d out, tied her\r\nloose, an this here’s the result. Good by, old Antelope!--_Hic jacet._\r\nThere’s Lating for ye, boys,” he added, mournfully. “You’re studyin that\r\nat the Academy, an kin onderstand the feelins of the onhappy Corbit.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk so, captain,” cried Bart. “We’ll help you. We got out all\r\nthe ballast to-day. Come; can’t you think of some way to save her? Isn’t\r\nthere any way? We’ll help you if you want help. We’ll wait here till the\r\nnext tide, and get her righted.”\r\n\r\n“No go--” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“You give up too quick,” cried Bart, more earnestly than before. “Can’t\r\nsomething be done? We’ll help you, you know.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head solemnly; then looking earnestly at the\r\nboys, he slowly ejaculated,--\r\n\r\n“No go, boys; that there schooner’s a gone sucker!”\r\n\r\nThe tone in which Captain Corbet uttered these words was one of such\r\nquiet despair, that none of the boys had anything to say. They all felt\r\nthat he knew best. Besides, he was most directly concerned in the loss\r\nof the Antelope, and if he gave up, then there was no hope for them.\r\nThen also they had offered their services, and Captain Corbet had\r\ndeclined them. What more could they do? Nothing more; that was evident.\r\nSo they listened in mournful silence to his last words.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Captain Corbet, impressively. She’s a gone sucker! An it was\r\no’ny my fault. I’d ort to hev tied her up. But I didn’t. Cos why? Cos I\r\nhed to hurry off to the babby. It was the infant that called me off from\r\nmy dooty to the schewner, an this here’s the end. Sarves me right.\r\nO’ny it’s a heavy loss, an I wouldn’t mind it if it was my loss. But\r\n’tain’t my loss. It’s hisn. It’s the infant’s. And the wust of it is,\r\nthe loss is total; for the schewner’s a gone sucker!”\r\n\r\n“I see how it is,” he resumed, as the boys stood round him in respectful\r\nsilence, full of sympathy for his loss,--“I see how it is. It’s the\r\nfinger of Providence. You see,” he continued, with a deeper solemnity,\r\n“you see it’s intended to show me that I’m to devote myself altogether\r\nto the babby. I onst dug for gold--I ben warned off. I traversed the\r\nbriny deep with potatoes--warned off again. This here’s what I call a\r\nwarnin, an I take it as sich, an henceforth intend to give myself up to\r\nthe babby. That’s about it.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet then relapsed into silence, and once more fixed his\r\nabstracted gaze upon the lost schooner. The boys could do nothing, and\r\nfull of respectful sympathy, they withdrew in silence, and returned to\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nIt was almost tea-time, and all the boys were out in front of the\r\nAcademy. Mr. Long was walking up and down the portico, chatting with\r\nDr. Porter. The “B. O. W. C.” were there engaged with the others in the\r\ngeneral sport, when suddenly Phil seized Bart’s arm, and pointed to the\r\navenue.\r\n\r\n“Look,” he cried.\r\n\r\nBart looked, and saw the familiar figure of Captain Corbet. He was\r\nwalking rapidly, straight up towards the portico.\r\n\r\nThe “B. O. W. C.” at once rushed up to him.\r\n\r\n“Whar’s Mr. Long?” said Captain Corbet, who seemed very much excited.\r\n\r\n“Up there,” said Bart, pointing to the portico.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet said no more, but hurried on in the direction indicated,\r\nand soon ascended the steps of the portico, immediately in front of Mr.\r\nLong.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Long,” said he, in great agitation, “I’ve got into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, captain,” said Mr. Long. “How do you do? Trouble? What trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Along o’ that stone fence.”\r\n\r\n“The stone fence?” said Mr. Long. “How’s that? We put it all back in its\r\nplace, better than ever.”\r\n\r\n“Any how,” said Captain Corbet, “they’ve gone an sarved a writ on me.”\r\n\r\n“A writ!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Damages done to property by removal of wall. An they’re going\r\nto prosecute me! An me jest lost the schewner. Me, with nothin left but\r\nmy little farm to leave tew the babby!”\r\n\r\nHe paused, overcome by his emotion.\r\n\r\n“Damages?” said Mr. Long, who was filled with pity at Captain Corbet’s\r\nevident distress. “O, don’t be afraid. They can’t do anything. I’ll take\r\nthe responsibility. I took the stones, you know. You had nothing to do\r\nwith it. I’ll guarantee your safety. Don’t trouble yourself. When is the\r\nsuit to come off?”\r\n\r\n“The day after to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Don’t you trouble yourself at all. I’ll see to it. I’ll be\r\nthere and defend you, and I’m very much mistaken if they will be able to\r\nmake out a case against you. If they do, I’ll pay the damages.”\r\n\r\nA flush came over Captain Corbet’s pale face. It was not merely Mr.\r\nLong’s promise to espouse his cause, and see him harmless, but the\r\nsympathy of his tone and manner.\r\n\r\nHe seized Mr. Long’s hand in both of his.\r\n\r\n“O, Mr. Long! Onst I thought you was hardhearted, but now I see I was\r\nmistook; for a kinder nor pleasanter spoken gentleman never lived. An\r\nwhen my babby can learn tew speak, I’ll teach him to come down here and\r\nbelless you! For you’ve saved me from ruination, and snatched the infant\r\nfrom want and woe. That babby, Mr. Long--”\r\n\r\n“O, never mind; its nothing,” said Mr. Long, hurriedly. “The day after\r\nto-morrow--is it? Well, I’ll be prepared. All right. Don’t be afraid.\r\nI’ll see all about it. I’m very busy now, or I’d talk more about it. You\r\ncome here the day after to-morrow. Mind. Don’t forget. Good by.”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this Mr. Long dragged Dr. Porter away from the portico,\r\nleaving Captain Corbet muttering inarticulate words about his babby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_A most mysterious Sound in a most mysterious Place.--What is\r\nit?--General Panic.--The adventurous Explorers.--They are baffled.--Is\r\nPat at the Bottom of it?--Bart takes his Life in his Hand, and goes\r\nalone to encounter the Mystery of the Garret._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys had much to talk about that night. These had been eventful\r\ntimes. There was their excitement about the mineral rod, and their\r\nmemorable experiment in the cellar; there was the unlading of the\r\nstones, and the bright prospect of more holidays; there was the sorrow\r\nof Corbet over his lost Antelope; and finally there was the prospect\r\nof the approaching trial, when Mr. Long would defend the cause of the\r\ninnocent. Were not these matters sufficiently exciting to keep the boys\r\nawake till a late hour? Methinks they were.\r\n\r\nAbove all, that roar which had startled them at their midnight work\r\nnever ceased to perplex them. Bruce, who was superstitious, still clung\r\nto his belief in its supernatural origin, but the other boys were one\r\nand all convinced that it was a hoax. But who had done it? Did the\r\nperpetrators of that hoax belong to the school? or did they belong to\r\nthe village? or were they Gaspereau-gians? On these points they took\r\nsides, and had long arguments, which led to no conclusion in particular,\r\nbut left them where they were.\r\n\r\nOne conclusion they did come to, however, and that was to keep their\r\nadventure a profound secret, and wait to see if the mystery would not be\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their fatigue, they were so excited by the recent events,\r\nthat they all remained in the Rawdons’ rooms till quite a late hour. The\r\nAcademy was still, and everybody seemed to have gone to bed. Bart, Tom,\r\nand Phil were about to retire to their own rooms, when suddenly there\r\noccurred something which made every one of them start to his feet.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, wild, shrill cry, somewhere between a howl and a hoot,\r\nand it sounded in the attic above. Before they could recover from their\r\nfirst shock it sounded again and again.\r\n\r\nBruce’s face grew pale, and the others looked at one another with\r\nwide-open eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Rawdons’ rooms were in the third story, and immediately above them\r\nwas the attic, which ran the whole length of the Academy, all unfinished\r\nexcept a little chamber at this end occupied by Pat. Pat’s room was\r\nimmediately over Bart’s; and as the Academy was divided into separate\r\ncompartments, each with its own entrance and stairways, it had no\r\nconnection with this part. Midway in the unfinished attic rose the\r\ncupola, supported by a network of vast beams, a favorite place of resort\r\nfor the boys, on account of the magnificence of the prospect which it\r\ncommanded. On rainy days the attic formed a fine place for exercise,\r\nbut at night its vast and gloomy extent served rather to repel visitors.\r\nSuch was the place through which now sounded that discordant and horrid\r\ncry which had so startled the boys.\r\n\r\n“There it is again!” said Bruce at last.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Bart--“that?--that is nothing to what it was up in the\r\ncellar.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go up and see what it is,” said Bruce, who again, as before,\r\nmastered the weakness of his superstitious fear by a supreme effort of\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the others. “Now’s our chance.”\r\n\r\nBruce and Arthur each took a lamp, and they started off. Scarcely had\r\nthey passed out into the hall, than another of those shrill cries came,\r\nand at the same time they heard three peculiar knocks. They stopped\r\nfor a moment to listen. As they stopped, the door opposite opened, and\r\nJiggins appeared. He looked pale and disturbed.\r\n\r\n“What’s all the row, Jiggins?” asked Bart. “Row?” said Jiggins; “I don’t\r\nknow. I don’t like it at all. It don’t somehow sound altogether right. I\r\nthink you’d better not--”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jiggins’s voice was drowned by another howl. He started,\r\nand looked at the others in silence.\r\n\r\nBy this time they heard below the noise of doors opening, and shuffling\r\nfeet. The voices of Bogud and Billymack, and Johnny Blue, and Muckle,\r\nwere heard calling up to them. They shouted back, after which the others\r\ncame up to the hall, and they all stood listening at the foot of the\r\nstairs. In the midst of this, other footsteps were heard, and Pat made\r\nhis appearance.\r\n\r\n“I ran out,” said he, “an I saw lights up here--an I came up. Ye’v heard\r\nit--haven’t ye’s?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart; “do you know what it is?”\r\n\r\n“Me!” cried Pat; “sure didn’t I hear it close by me room? and didn’t I\r\nrun for it?”.\r\n\r\n“It’s mighty queer,” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“I think we’d better go down,” said David Digg; “whatever it is, it’s\r\nsomething that we ought not to face.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Bogud!” said Bart; “we’re going up.”\r\n\r\n“Up, is it?” cried Pat; “‘deed, then, an ye’d betther not! Ye don’t know\r\nwhat it is that’s up there.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there sounded once more those peculiar knocks.\r\n\r\n“Many’s the time I heard that,” said Pat. “It’s a black, bad place.”\r\n\r\n“Wern’t you frightened?” asked Bogud, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Sure it cudn’t make any differ whether I wor frightened or not. The\r\nlikes of me’s got to bear thim things.”\r\n\r\nAnd now there came another uproar. It was yell after yell, so wild,\r\nso harsh, and so discordant, that the former noises were nothing in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nBogud beat a hasty retreat, and Jiggins backed into his doorway. The\r\nother boys fell back a little, but the “B. O. W. C.” stood their ground,\r\nand Bruce put his foot on the lowest step to ascend to the attic.\r\n\r\n“Sure ye’ll not be goin up!” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will,” said Bart. “Come along--all of you.”\r\n\r\n“IPs kilt ye’ll be!” wailed Pat--“it’s dead intirely ye’ll find\r\nyerselves when ye come back!”\r\n\r\n“Come along, boys,” cried Phil, as he hurried up after Bruce. “Come,\r\nPat. It’s all humbug.”\r\n\r\n“Come along,” cried Bart; “you needn’t pretend to be frightened, Pat;\r\nyou’re only humbugging. It’s my belief that you know all about it. Can’t\r\nI tell by your face whether you’re really frightened or not?”\r\n\r\n“Me!” cried Pat, with a very queer intonation, that sounded like a\r\nmournful wail struggling with wild laughter. “Is it me? O woro-o-o!\r\nIsn’t it to danger yere goin thin! Don’t blame me if I didn’t warrun\r\nye’s. Och, but it’s a black day intirely! Come along, boys,” he said to\r\nthe others who were left. “Let’s go down out of this to the flure below.”\r\n\r\nThese last words were not heard by the “B. O. W. C.,” who were by\r\nthis time in the attic, peering through the gloom, and waiting for a\r\nrecurrence of the sound.\r\n\r\nThey listened for a long time, but they heard no noise at all. No\r\nshrieks, no knocks whatever were heard. At length they began to go\r\nabout. They walked first towards that end of the attic where Pat’s room\r\nwas, and the only noise they heard was the heavy footsteps of Pat as he\r\nascended the stairs and entered his room.\r\n\r\n“It’s my firm belief,” said Bart, “that Pat is at the bottom of all this\r\nhumbug. Of course we won’t find anything. There won’t be so much as a\r\nknock, let alone a howl.”\r\n\r\nThey walked all about, and at last reached the place where the cupola\r\narose. It was built over the main part of the Academy, from which wings\r\nextended on either side. This main part was taken up with the Academy\r\nhall, which, however, did not rise so high as the floor of the attic,\r\nand the consequence was, that there yawned here a dark abyss some\r\nfifteen feet in depth, and sixty or eighty feet square. Above rose the\r\nstout timbers, crossing one another in all directions, through the\r\nmidst of? which ladders ascended into the cupola. Some loose planks laid\r\nacross this abyss, from beam to beam, formed a rather dangerous pathway.\r\nThis the boys traversed, and crossing to the opposite side, they\r\nwandered about the long, dark loft, gazing curiously in all directions.\r\nThere was no flooring on this side, but only beams, with the laths and\r\nplaster of the lower rooms between them. Their search took them over\r\nthis, but nothing whatever came of it.\r\n\r\nThey searched the whole attic most thoroughly, but could find nothing.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, “we can’t do anything more. For my part I’m\r\nfagged out, and I’m going to bed.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal met with the approbation of all the others. They were all\r\nvery tired, very sleepy, and very much disgusted at their failure.\r\n\r\nSo they went down the steps, and the Rawdons went into their room, and\r\nthe others turned to go down.\r\n\r\nBut just at that moment the yells and the hoots sounded out again in a\r\ndeafening volley--then all was still.\r\n\r\n“O, yell away!” cried Bart, angrily; “we’ll find you out some day.\r\nDepend upon it, boys, Pat’s at the bottom of it. If he is, let him\r\nlook out; that’s all. I’ll teach him a lesson that he won’t forget in\r\na hurry. Come, Phil. Come, Tom. Good by, Bruce and Arthur. If you feel\r\ninclined for another hunt to-night, you may make it yourselves. I’m\r\ngoing to bed, and I’ll sleep till nine tomorrow in spite of all the\r\nnoises that can be scared up.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Bart retired along with Tom and Phil; and he kept his\r\nword, for he slept as sound as a top, and did not make his appearance on\r\nthe next day till long after the other boys were up.\r\n\r\nAfter getting his breakfast from Solomon, he wandered out into the\r\ngrounds in front of the Academy, where he found nearly all the school\r\ngathered, and in a great excitement. The noises had been heard all\r\nthrough the night by most cf them, and had excited every varying shade\r\nof superstitious terror. Bogud had told them about the attempt of\r\nthe “B. O. W. C.” to find out the mystery, and Tom had been forced\r\nto acknowledge their failure. All this, of course, made an immense\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nDifferent theories arose among them, most of them tinged with\r\nsuperstition. All these theories referred to an old legend that the\r\nAcademy had been built on a spot where some French houses had once\r\nstood, and that the cellars were beneath the building. Out of this\r\nlegend some of the boys created a wild theory, which connected the\r\nharm-less Acadians with the hideous noises of the past night. Jiggins\r\nand Bogud were both inclined to this. Pat was very industrious in going\r\nabout among the boys with terrific descriptions of what he had heard;\r\nand as his room was actually in the attic, and only separated from its\r\ngloomy extent by a thin board partition, his authority was considered\r\nsufficient for any belief, however wild. Pat, in fact, was a great man\r\nthat day, and fairly revelled in the awe-struck faces of the small boys\r\nas they questioned him about his experience. These small boys all lived\r\nin another building called the Boarding House, which stood near the\r\nAcademy, but apart from it; and as they listened to Pat’s wild stories\r\nthey congratulated themselves that they were not within hearing of such\r\nterrific sounds.\r\n\r\nBart heard all this, he watched the effect which this story had\r\nproduced, and he saw how Pat was glorifying himself on this occasion.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, boys,” said he to his friends, as they found\r\nthemselves together apart from the others. “In all this school there is\r\none, and only one, that knows about this row, and that is Pat. I’m sure\r\nof it. If I had a doubt before, it’s vanished now. Why, look at him\r\nover there, frightening the small boys out of their wits. Well,” he\r\ncontinued, after a pause, “very well; just wait a while, and see if I\r\ndon’t pay up Pat for this.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bart could do it unobserved, he went up to explore the attic.\r\nHe spent a long time there, and did not come down till the dinner bell\r\nrang. Then after dinner he went up again, and spent the afternoon. His\r\ninvestigation was long and searching; but what he found, and where he\r\nfound it, and how he found it, and in fact whether he found anything at\r\nall or not, he did not tell to a single soul, no, not even to the “B. O.\r\nW. C.” As Bart preserved such secrecy, I’m sure I’m not going to divulge\r\nit just yet. I will do as Bart did, and keep my own counsel, and wait\r\ntill the proper time comes for the disclosure.\r\n\r\nAnd any boy who thinks there’s going to be a ghost in the garret, or\r\na phantom in the French orchard, had better,--well, he had better keep\r\nreading straight on. That’s about the best advice I can give him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_The great, the famous, and the never-to-be-forgotten Trial.--Captain\r\nCorbet hauled up before the Bar of Rhadamanthus.--Town and\r\nGown.--Attitude of the gallant Captain.--The sympathizing\r\nTownsmen.--Old Zeke and his Bat.--Mr. Long’s eloquent Oration, ending\r\nin the Apotheosis of Captain Corbet’s Baby. (For meaning of above\r\nword--Apotheosis--see Dictionary.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE day appointed for the hearing of Captain Corbet’s case was awaited\r\nwith an excitement which was almost equal to that which had been created\r\nby the affair in the attic. It was to come off at eleven o’clock; but\r\nthe impatience of the boys was not to be restrained, and long before\r\nthat time they were all out in front of the Academy, gathered together\r\nin groups, and discussing the probabilities of the trial. The wall had\r\nbeen removed, and put into the schooner for ballast, and carried away.\r\nIt had been kept for more than a week. That was all undeniable. But,\r\nthen, on the other hand, it had all been replaced, so that it was better\r\nthan ever. That was equally undeniable. How, then, could the owner\r\nprosecute? What damage had been done? In fact, the opinion of the boys\r\nwas, that instead of prosecuting, he ought to make the school a present\r\nof some kind,--say a couple of barrels of apples, in return for their\r\nskill and industry in rebuilding his old rickety, tumble-down stone\r\nwall. Besides, he had no business to prosecute Captain Corbet. Mr. Long\r\nwas the guilty party. Why not prosecute him?\r\n\r\nOn the whole it was a question full of interest, and as the appointed\r\nhour drew near, its advent created greater and greater excitement.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before eleven the door of Dr. Porter’s house opened, and\r\nout came Mr. Long, followed by Captain Corbet, while Mr. Simmons and the\r\ndoctor brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nTheir appearance was greeted with three rousing cheers by all the boys;\r\nand as their respected teachers walked on towards the village, the\r\nentire school followed at their heels, in a very irregular, very\r\ndisorderly, and very noisy procession.\r\n\r\nThe place where the trial was to come off was about half way between\r\nthe Academy and Mud Creek. It was in a small hall which was built for\r\nlectures, public gatherings, tea meetings and so forth. It was now\r\nturned into a court of law, and the awful Rhadamanthus who presided here\r\nwas a well-known and very popular villager, who, by some singular freak\r\nof fortune, had been made a justice of the peace. His name was Pieter\r\nSchwab, and he was of Dutch extraction. He was short, round, fat, had a\r\nbald head, double chin, gray and somewhat fishy eyes, flaxen hair,\r\npudgy hands, thick, wheezy voice; and though born and brought up in the\r\ncountry, he still spoke with that musical and mellifluous Dutch accent\r\nwhich he had inherited from his ancestors.\r\n\r\nAs the party from the hill entered, they found Mr. Pieter Schwab,\r\njustice of the peace, seated in the chair of justice. The prosecutor\r\nwas there too, with a large number of villagers, who took an intense\r\ninterest in the case; and when the boys crowded in, the little hall was\r\ncrammed.\r\n\r\nOne cause of the prosecution--indeed, the only cause--lay in a certain\r\nkind of hostility which existed between the village and the hill. It\r\nwas a sort of “town and gown” feeling, which was not confined to the\r\nvillage, but spread over the country, and particularly Gaspereaux. It\r\nwas this feeling which brought the villagers at the present time to the\r\ncourt of Rhadamanthus. Still there was not so much partisanship on\r\nthis occasion as there would have been if the dispute had been directly\r\nbetween the village and the hill; for Captain Corbet was the one who was\r\nprosecuted, and Captain Corbet happened to be a great favorite in the\r\nvillage. The villagers present were therefore very uncertain in their\r\nsympathies; they wished the hill to be beaten, but they didn’t want\r\nCaptain Corbet to suffer. The loss of the Antelope, which seemed by this\r\ntime far gone to destruction, excited additional sympathy; and as his\r\nvenerable form appeared, a murmur of friendly feeling went round, and a\r\nscore of horny hands were stretched out to grasp his.\r\n\r\nThe suit against Captain Corbet was for the recovery of damages incurred\r\nby the illegal, violent, malicious, injurious, felonious, dishonest,\r\nmalignant, mischievous, wanton, secret, forcible, burglarious, and\r\ncriminal removal of a portion of the stone wall surrounding the potato\r\nfield of the prosecutor, whereby the said prosecutor had sustained\r\ngrievous harm and loss. The prosecutor, in setting forth his grievances,\r\nstated that it might have been made a criminal action, but out of\r\nkindness to Captain Corbet he had decided to make it a civil one, and\r\nmerely wished to have the losses which he had suffered made good.\r\n\r\nThe bill of damages was a very heavy one, amounting to no less a sum\r\nthan five hundred dollars--an amount which poor Captain Corbet could\r\nnever have paid, and which was perfectly preposterous. The knowledge of\r\nthis excited a fresh demonstration of feeling in favor of the venerable\r\ndefendant; and, at length, even before the trial had fairly begun,\r\nthere was not a villager present who was not heart and soul in favor of\r\nCaptain Corbet.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor brought forward testimony to prove damages. His sole\r\ntestimony consisted of one witness, who was known by the name of Old\r\nZeke--a poor worthless character, whose life vibrated between begging\r\nand getting drunk. He swore that on a certain day he happened to be\r\ndown by the creek, and saw a horse in the field where the fence had been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nMr. Long proceeded to examine this witness. Mr. Long had a singularly\r\nkeen and acute mind, and the witness was nothing in his hands. Old\r\nZeke in a few minutes became so confused that he could not testify to\r\nanything. He said first that the day was Tuesday, then Wednesday, then\r\nThursday, then he wouldn’t be sure but that it might be Friday, then\r\nSaturday, and at length he wouldn’t swear but that it might have been\r\nSunday. Finally, he said that he wouldn’t swear to the day at all. After\r\nthis, he was so pressed by Mr. Long, that he thought that the horse\r\nmight have been a cow; and then he said he wouldn’t swear that it wasn’t\r\na sheep, or a goat, or a dog. Finally, Mr. Long asked him on his oath if\r\nhe would swear that it wasn’t a rat, and Old Zeke wouldn’t swear that it\r\nwasn’t, a rat.\r\n\r\nOld Zeke’s total discomfiture, however, was nothing to Mr. Long. It was\r\nmere child’s play. He longed to close with a worthier antagonist--with\r\nthe prosecutor himself. The prosecutor swore that cattle had got into\r\nhis potato field, and had done damage which he had estimated at over\r\nfive hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Long now proceeded to grapple with the prosecutor.\r\n\r\nCould he prove damages to the extent of five hundred dollars? He could,\r\nall? And how? Could he prove that any cattle had got in? Had he himself\r\nseen any cattle? No. No? Who, then, had seen them? Old Zeke. Old Zeke?\r\nVery good.\r\n\r\nWould the prosecutor be kind enough to state which of the cattle that\r\nOld Zeke had seen had done the damage? Was it Old Zeke’s rat!\r\n\r\nAt this a roar of laughter arose from the spectators, who were now in\r\nthe highest state of excitement.\r\n\r\nAnd what might have been the value of the potatoes planted there,--or\r\nhow much would it cost to replant them? Two dollars, or twenty? Over\r\nhow much ground had Old Zeke’s rat gone, and how many potatoes had Old\r\nZeke’s rat eaten? Would he swear that Old Zeke’s rat wouldn’t have eaten\r\nthe potatoes even if the wall had been standing? Would he swear that\r\nit was possible for any one rat, in five or six days, to eat up five\r\nhundred dollars’ worth of potatoes?\r\n\r\nIn a short time the prosecutor had got into an awful state of wrath and\r\nconfusion. But Mr. Long was merciless, and had made up his mind not to\r\nspare him. So he rang the changes on Old Zeke’s rat and the potatoes\r\ntill all the assembly were convulsed with laughter, and the prosecutor\r\nwas purple with fury and bewilderment.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Long changed his tone to one of greater seriousness. Alluding\r\nto the prosecutor’s oath; that the damage had amounted to five hundred\r\ndollars, he questioned him with merciless severity as to how he had made\r\nthat estimate.\r\n\r\nHad he dug up the potatoes to see if they had been injured?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHad he ploughed up the field and sowed it again?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThe field remained, then, as it had been planted?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nOn his oath, did he, or did he not, expect a crop of potatoes?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHow much was planted?\r\n\r\nOne acre.\r\n\r\nHow much would be raised?\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred bushels.\r\n\r\nHow much would they fetch?\r\n\r\nAbout fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nMaking allowance for expenses of digging, what would be the value?\r\n\r\nAbout forty dollars.\r\n\r\nAll these replies were wrung out from the prosecutor only by extreme\r\npressure. He felt that he was in a bad position, and struggled hard\r\nagainst it. His face grew red, and big drops of perspiration rolled down\r\nover his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Forty dollars!” Mr. Long thundered out. “And yet you swear to five\r\nhundred dollars’ damage. You prosecute an aged, a virtuous, and an\r\nestimable fellow-citizen, and you dare to take an oath against him to\r\nsuch a frightful untruth! What is this? Is it malice, or what? But if\r\nmalice, what is there that could ever have been done against you by one\r\nso simple-hearted and so true and honest as Captain Corbet?”\r\n\r\nAll this produced a tremendous effect, on the spectators, on the\r\nprosecutor, and on Rhadamanthus.\r\n\r\nBut now Mr. Long came down harder than ever upon the unfortunate\r\nprosecutor. He declared himself ready to prove that Captain Corbet never\r\ntook away the stone fence at all.\r\n\r\nThis was easily done.\r\n\r\nFirst, every one of the boys was summoned to give his simple statement\r\nof the facts. The whole truth came out, and it was clearly shown\r\nthat Captain Corbet must have been in total ignorance of the whole\r\ntransaction. To the testimony of the boys was added that of Mr. Simmons;\r\nand he, with all the rest, alluded in touching terms to the occupation\r\nof the captain while the stone wall was disappearing. Stone walls?\r\nCaptain Corbet? _He_ touch them? Why, he was nursing his baby at home\r\nall the time!\r\n\r\nAs the boys came forward, one by one, Captain Corbet looked at them,\r\nand listened in eager attention, with a smile of love on his meek and\r\nvenerable face. As they spoke of his absence from the scene, that smile\r\nbroadened into one of deeper affection; but finally, as they spoke of\r\nhis occupation, of his home, of that morning when they found him there\r\nwith his baby, it was too much. His heart beat fast,--a flood of tender\r\nrecollections thronged into his memory,--tears started to his eyes.\r\n\r\nBut what could he do?\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nHe could only grasp the hands of those who stood nearest, and wring\r\nthem, and murmur broken words:--\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. That’s so. That’s all gospel truth. It’s jest so. I wasn’t\r\nnigh the schewner. It was the babby. Him it was. I was a nussin of him,\r\nan a feedin of him, an a singin an a hummin to him. An I knowed nothin\r\nmore about that thar stone wall than the man in the mune.”\r\n\r\nAnd all these words of Captain Corbet, together with the simple\r\nstatements of the boys, combined to strengthen the convictions of the\r\nvillagers that the poor captain was a deeply injured man.\r\n\r\nNow, of all these circumstances which tended to establish Captain\r\nCorbet’s perfect freedom from all possible blame, Mr. Long was not\r\nneglectful of a single one. He gathered them all up in his mind, and\r\nafter all the witnesses had been examined, prepared to hurl them\r\nwith tremendous force at the head of the miserable, and now almost\r\npanic-stricken, prosecutor.\r\n\r\nMr. Long was a man of magnificent presence---tall, leonine in aspect,\r\nand impressive in manner; he joined to these advantages a wonderful\r\nacuteness of thought, and a copious flow of eloquent language. Besides,\r\nhe was stung by the cowardly act of the prosecutor, who attacked poor\r\nCaptain Corbet, instead of attacking himself, who was the real culprit,\r\nif there were any culprit; and so he determined to read that man a\r\nlesson which he would always remember, and prepared to pour out all the\r\nfull vials of his wrath upon his miserable head. No damage whatever had\r\nbeen done, or could have been done. And yet this man tried to ruin\r\nCaptain Corbet out of petty spite. That was enough for Mr. Long.\r\n\r\nHe began by a severe review of the prosecutor’s statements, and a still\r\nmore severe criticism of his charges for damages. Old Zeke’s rat was\r\nonce more brought out for the benefit of the village audience, and light\r\njesting was mingled with scathing denunciation. Old Zeke himself did not\r\nescape, and Mr. Long asked his hearers to judge what kind of a cause it\r\nwas, which had need of such a witness.\r\n\r\nThen he showed the enormous difference between the utmost value of\r\nthe potatoes, even if all were spoiled, and the charge made by the\r\nprosecutor. The fact that the prosecutor had sworn to five hundred\r\ndollars’ damage was enlarged upon in indignant language, which accused\r\nthat prosecutor of nothing less than perjury.\r\n\r\nThen, taking all these facts together, he sought for a motive, and\r\ncould find nothing else than extreme avarice or excessive malignity. And\r\nagainst whom? Against Captain Corbet, one of our oldest, most virtuous,\r\nmost respected, and most venerable citizens; one whose character had\r\nnever before been impeached; one who was loved and revered by all; who\r\nnever had a quarrel, who had never made an enemy, and who had never\r\nstood in a court of law before until this day.\r\n\r\nAt this there was an immense sensation. The boys and the villagers\r\nmingled together in crowding near to Captain Corbet, in order to show\r\ntheir sympathy with his unmerited woes.\r\n\r\n“And who was Captain Corbet,” he asked, at length, “against whom this\r\nruinous charge had been made?” This was a question full of interest, for\r\nit led him to consider the character of the defendant. He alluded to his\r\nmany virtues, his reputation, his popularity; he touched also, in gentle\r\nterms, upon his recent loss in the destruction of the Antelope; and\r\nby skilfully intermingling the excellences of Captain Corbet with his\r\nafflictions, he excited still more the commiseration of his hearers.\r\n\r\nFinally, he considered the testimony as to the actual occupation of\r\nCaptain Corbet while the fence was being taken away.\r\n\r\n“He knew nothing whatever about it,” said Mr. Long,--“absolutely\r\nnothing. He was not there. He was far away. Where was he? Where was this\r\nman who has been, charged with being a trespasser and a thief? Where was\r\nthis man who has been accused of removing his neighbor’s landmarks, and\r\nlaying waste his neighbor’s fields? Where?”\r\n\r\nMr. Long paused for a moment, and his eyes looked all around over the\r\ncrowd, and finally settled upon the frightened face of the unhappy\r\nprosecutor.\r\n\r\n“Where was he?” repeated Mr. Long.\r\n\r\nAgain he paused, perhaps with a slight feeling of regard for the poor\r\nprosecutor; perhaps, on the other hand, with a desire to make his speech\r\nmore effective; perhaps carried away by his own eloquence, and merely\r\nseeking the most appropriate language with which to clothe his vehement\r\nthoughts; perhaps because he faltered for an instant before he should\r\nsay what was in his mind to say.\r\n\r\n“Where was he?” he repeated once more. “Where? Why, all the time\r\nfar away from the schooner, from the wharf, and from the stone wall;\r\nignorant of everything that was going on; thinking of far different\r\nthings--seated in his own house, on his own chair, by his own fireside.\r\nYes, alone; and engaged in what I have heard him call a parent’s fondest\r\njoy! Not stealing arway a stone wall! No! but administering, in\r\nthe seclusion of his own home, to the necessities of his\r\noffspring,--supplying nutriment to his--ah--infant--ah--in\r\nfact,--ah--nursing with his own hands--his--ah--his baby!”\r\n\r\nMr. Long stopped abruptly. He saw Captain Corbet making a violent effort\r\nto get near to him; but he avoided him, and the venerable navigator had\r\nto pour out his feelings to others who stood nearer.\r\n\r\nThe end of it all was, that the case was dismissed, and the prosecutor\r\nhad to pay costs--though that was not much.\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Corbet was for a short time the hero of the village and of\r\nthe hill. As he came forth they all cheered him with united voices; and\r\nabout two hundred, consisting of men and boys, shook hands with him.\r\n\r\nAnd all the boys marched along with him nearly all the way to his home.\r\n\r\nAnd then they went to the hill, and spent the remainder of the day in\r\ndiscussing the famous trial.\r\n\r\nAnd every one of them, from Bruce down to the smallest boy of the\r\nprimary department, was in a state of frenzy about Captain Corbet and\r\nMr. Long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_The Valley of the Gasper eaux.--Invading the Enemy’s\r\nTerritory.--Defiance.--Returning Home to find their own Territory\r\ninvaded.--The Camp.--The missing Ones.--Where are they?--The\r\nGaspereaugians?_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next night the noises in the attic were renewed. Bart lay calmly\r\nslumbering, and remained undisturbed, but all the rest of the boys were\r\nvery greatly excited. They turned out of their rooms, and talked with\r\none another in the halls, and most of them passed a sleepless night. Tom\r\nand Phil, who roomed near Bart, knocked at his door to rouse him. He got\r\nup, opened the door, and declared that they had better go back to bed.\r\nHe assured them that it was a hoax, and that Pat was probably at the\r\nbottom of it. For his part he was sleepy, and wouldn’t bother\r\nhimself about it that night at any rate. So Tom and Phil, seeing his\r\nindifference, went back to bed, and fell asleep. Bruce and Arthur,\r\nhowever, being close under the attic, were more disturbed; and after\r\ntrying in vain to sleep, they rose, took a lamp, and went up into the\r\nattic. Jiggins again met them as they came out of their room, at his\r\ndoor, but declined going up. So the two brothers went up together, and\r\nlooked around for some time without finding anything. While they were\r\nup there the noises ceased; but after they had gone down, disgusted with\r\nthis second failure, the noises were renewed. But familiarity breeds\r\ncontempt, and Bruce himself had lost his superstitious fear. He was\r\nconvinced that it was a hoax, and so he felt only irritated at the\r\nnoise. Having failed to discover the cause, both he and Arthur went to\r\nbed, and for the rest of the night, in spite of the noises, they slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Bruce proposed a walk to Gaspereaux. All\r\nacceded to this proposition except Bart. He did not care about going.\r\nHe had several things, he said, which he wished to attend to. After vain\r\nefforts to persuade him to accompany them, an arrangement was finally\r\nmade that he should meet them at the camp at four o’clock. This Bart\r\nacceded to, and promised to bring provisions enough to supply them all\r\nwith a bounteous and a generous repast.\r\n\r\nThe school was all alive that morning with excitement. Nothing was\r\ntalked of, nothing thought of, but the unaccountable noises in the\r\nattic. Again, as before, the theories of superstition were put forth.\r\nAgain, as before, Jiggins and Bogud shook their heads solemnly over the\r\nmatter, and declared that there was something serious in it. Again, as\r\nbefore, Pat went around among the boys giving a terrific account of\r\nhis own experience, and expatiating upon the hardships which he had to\r\nundergo in living in a room which was close to that place of horror--the\r\nattic. But in spite of his professed fear, Pat did not seem to suffer\r\nin bodily health in any way. His appetite was as good, his complexion\r\nas ruddy, and his spirits as active as ever; and all the boys, as they\r\nheard his terrific experience, wondered how he could stand it so well.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, Bruce and the other boys started off for\r\nGaspereaux, leaving the whole school in this wild state of excitement.\r\nBruce, at the breakfast table, had entered into an argument with Jiggins\r\nabout the noise in the attic, in which he maintained the theory that it\r\nwas a hoax by somebody. Jiggins, on the other hand, boldly asserted that\r\nthe noises were supernatural, and announced his belief that it was done\r\nby some wandering Frenchman who had been exiled at the expulsion of the\r\nAcadians, and would never be at rest till the school should be given up.\r\nBogud, Billymack, Johnny Blue, Sammy Ram Ram, and Pat supported\r\nJiggins; while Muckle, Bart, Arthur, Tom, and Phil sustained Bruce. The\r\nargumentation was tremendous, but, as usual, resulted in nothing, since\r\neach was resolved to maintain his own opinion. Of those who thus argued,\r\ntwo only understood the case: the one was Pat, who said a great deal\r\non his side of the question; the other was Bart, who only made an\r\noccasional remark, and created a vague surprise by his general reserve.\r\nHe was usually outspoken and positive, but now he contented himself with\r\ngeneral remarks and indistinct hints. But though Bart said little on\r\nthis occasion, he kept his eyes open, and observed much. He noticed\r\nPat’s demeanor in particular, and marked the eager volubility with which\r\nhe supported Jiggins’s theory. This only strengthened his belief that\r\nPat was, as he said, at the bottom of it, and made him more determined\r\nthan ever to concoct some plan which should bring Pat to confusion, and\r\nforce him to a confession.\r\n\r\nSuch Avas the state of things, when Bruce, Avith his friends, started\r\noff to Gaspereaux, leaving Bart behind them, with the understanding that\r\nhe should join them, with provisions, at the camp, at four o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon. They took fishing-rods with them, and anticipated a day\r\nof sport.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Gaspereaux lay about a mile behind the Academy, and\r\nwas one of the most beautiful places in all that beautiful country. The\r\nriver has its origin in several lakes, which are only a few miles away\r\nfrom the sea; and after flowing from these, between lofty hills and over\r\nprecipices, where it falls in picturesque cataracts, it winds its way\r\nonward towards the Basin of Minas.\r\n\r\nOn either side arise steep slopes, and through the narrow valley between\r\nthese the river winds. It is only a small stream in many places, easily\r\nfordable, and the numerous trout at certain seasons make it a favorite\r\nresort for the angler. The narrow valley is dotted with trees and\r\ngroves, the borders of the little stream are lined with willows, the\r\nsoil is exceedingly fertile, and amid the foliage of trees and the green\r\nvegetation the cottages of the farmers and the tapering spires peep\r\nforth, with a picturesque beauty which adds new charms to this romantic\r\nspot. A road winds down one side of the valley and up the other, and\r\nthis road crosses the stream by a bridge, which forms a central spot,\r\nfrom which the eye may wander over a landscape, which for soft and quiet\r\nloveliness may be equalled by few, and surpassed by none, of those which\r\nin other climes have been celebrated by the poet or the artist.\r\n\r\nBut to venture into this delightful valley was not so safe for the boys\r\nof the Grand Pré school as was desirable. To go there was to penetrate\r\ninto an enemy’s country, and to encounter all the dangers of such an\r\nenterprise. For the feud which raged between “town and gown” extended\r\nover to Gaspereaux, and the boys of this valley were the chief enemies\r\nof the school. The winter was the great season for campaigning, and\r\nthen many were the snow-ball fights which took place between the\r\nhostile parties. During the other seasons there was a kind of truce;\r\nthe Gaspereaugians were generally busy on their farms, and no pitched\r\nbattles occurred. Still, at any season, it was not pleasant for any one\r\nbelonging to the school to find himself alone in Gaspereaux. For\r\nthis reason they generally went in parties. Sometimes, also, the\r\nGaspereaugians would invade the Academy woods, and commit various\r\ndepredations, such as breaking the dams, or tearing down the camps. Such\r\nwas the state of things at this time.\r\n\r\nAlong the crest of the hill that separates Gaspereaux Valley from Grand\r\nPré there ran a road originally made by the French Acadians, and known\r\nas the Ridge Road. A drive along this affords a series of the most\r\nmagnificent prospects imaginable, and it was a favorite walk for all\r\nconnected with the school. Bruce and his companions did not descend at\r\nonce into the valley, but turned up the Ridge Road, and walked along for\r\nsome distance. At last they descended through the woods into the upper\r\npart of the valley, and came to the river. It was quite shallow, and the\r\nboys walked up its bed, stepping from stone to stone, and occasionally\r\ntaking to the bank as they came to some deep spot. They all had brought\r\nrods and lines, and at length varied their pursuits by fishing. They\r\nfound plenty of angle-worms by turning up stones here and there. Phil\r\nwas most successful, for he succeeded in hooking seven very fine trout.\r\nBruce caught four, Arthur three, and Tom five. At length they grew tired\r\nof fishing, and as they felt hungry they made a fire, and cooked the\r\ntrout on the coals. They had no salt, but they found the old proverb to\r\nbe true, that hunger is the best seasoning; and so, being excessively\r\nhungry, they all found the broiled trout delicious.\r\n\r\nAmusements and occupations like these took up many hours, and so the\r\ntime passed, till at length they began to think of returning. They\r\ndecided to go back through the valley, and beard the lion in his den, by\r\nfacing the Gaspereaugians in their own retreat.\r\n\r\nOff they all started then, and taking the road, they walked along down\r\nthe valley. At every step they expected to encounter the enemy; but, to\r\ntheir surprise, no enemy appeared. The boys whom they saw from time to\r\ntime were too small to deserve notice. Reaching at last the place where\r\nthe road wound up the hill and went to Grand Pré, they turned aside, and\r\nstrolled along to the centre of the village. This was where the bridge\r\ncrossed the river. It was a beautiful place. An island lay midway, and\r\njust above the bridge was another island. Here they staid for some time,\r\nand fished; but no fish appeared. What was still more wonderful, no\r\nGaspereaugians appeared, either.\r\n\r\nThey could not account for it. They felt disappointed. It seemed like\r\na slight. After waiting as long as they could, they had to turn away at\r\nlast; and it was with something like indignation that they started back\r\nto the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the journey was uneventful; but when they reached the camp\r\nin the woods, where they expected to meet Bart, a strange and startling\r\nsight met their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe brook ran along through a little dell, and on either side the banks\r\narose. By the camp the bank on one side was steep, and covered with\r\ntrees; but the other side, a little lower down, was a gentle slope, bare\r\nof trees, and green with short, soft grass.\r\n\r\nAnd on this place Bruce and his companions saw a crowd of boys standing,\r\nregarding them with hostile faces, and apparently bent on mischief.\r\n\r\nThey were the Gaspereaugians.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugians!\r\n\r\nNow they understood it all. This, then, was the reason why they had\r\ngone through Gaspereaux unmolested. They had not been troubled, for\r\nthe simple reason that the Gaspereaugians had themselves been off on a\r\nforay, and this was their enterprise. They wondered what had become of\r\nBart and Solomon; and as Bruce thought of this, a dark frown came\r\nover his face, and he stood looking at the Gaspereaugians like a\r\nthunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_Bart and Solomon fall into an Ambush, and after a desperate\r\nResistance are made Prisoners.--Bonds and Imprisonment.--Bruce and\r\nthe Gaspereau-gians.--A Challenge, a Conflict, and a Victory.--Immense\r\nSensation among the Spectators.--The Prisoners burst their Bonds.--Their\r\nFlight.--Recovery of the Spoils of War._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE Bart and Solomon had been having their own little adventure.\r\nThey had left the Academy at half past three, so as to have everything\r\nready for the boys by four o’clock. For this purpose Solomon carried a\r\nbasket of provisions, filled with those multiform and very attractive\r\ndishes which his rare culinary genius never failed to create whenever a\r\nfitting occasion demanded it.\r\n\r\nSo they ascended the hill, and crossed the old French orchard, and\r\ndescended into the gully, and went up the other side into the woods, and\r\nthen walked along the path towards the camp.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as they came to a place where the path turned to the left,\r\nthere was a loud shout; and in an instant they were surrounded by some\r\ntwenty or thirty boys. The boys were rough and wild. They were dressed\r\nin homespun. They were strong-limbed, red-cheeked, horny-handed, burly\r\nfellows; and they threw themselves violently upon Bart and Solomon.\r\n\r\nBart struggled bravely; but what could he do against so many? In his\r\ndesperate struggles he managed to knock down one or two of them; but\r\nbefore long he was lying down, first on his back, and then on his face,\r\nand his hands were tied behind him. Then he was allowed to get up. He\r\ndid so, and found himself none the worse for the rough-and-tumble fight\r\nwhich he had been indulging in. A pang, however, came to his generous\r\nheart as he saw Solomon with his hands tied; and another pang, also, as\r\nhe saw two of the Gaspereaugians carrying off the basket with all its\r\nprecious store of provisions.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his situation, Bart did not for a moment lose heart.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you have managed it with less than thirty?” he said, quietly,\r\nto the Gaspereaugians. “Wouldn’t twenty have done to attack me and old\r\nSolomon?”\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugians looked sulky at this.\r\n\r\n“Ten, I should say,” resumed Bart. “Ten Gaspereaugians ought to be\r\nenough for one of us; and if so, why bring thirty? Answer me that. You\r\nwon’t? Very well. All the same.”\r\n\r\n“Here, young chap,--you dry up!” growled a big Gaspereaugian, who was\r\nnear him. “Ten of us? I’ll show you that I’m a match fur any ten o’\r\nyouns. That wull I jist. So dry up!”\r\n\r\n“It’s quite right to keep me tied up,” resumed Bart, cheerily. “I might\r\ndo you harm, and I only wonder you don’t tie my feet too. You wouldn’t\r\nbe safe if my hands were loose,--of course. But, my Gaspereaugian\r\nfriends, why bind the hands of my aged companion? He won’t hurt you.\r\nHe’s one of your own people. His home is in your own charming valley.\r\nYou all know old Solomon. I guarantee that he shall not harm one of you.\r\nSo, my friends, unbind his aged hands.”\r\n\r\n“You shut your mouth,” growled the big Gaspereaugian, “or I’ll precious\r\nsoon make you. I know you,--young f’ler,--no humbug! You’re the chap\r\nthat blacked my eye with a snowball last winter.”\r\n\r\n“Was it you?” said Bart, with a laugh. “That _is_ capital! If I wasn’t\r\ntied up, I’d insist on shaking hands with you. And did I black your eye?\r\nHa, ha, ha! I never knew that before. It was a capital shot. I remember,\r\nnow that you mention it. But look here--you gave me something back. You\r\ngave me a snowball that set my nose bleeding for half an hour; and that,\r\nI think, was about the only blood that was shed in all our battles.”\r\n\r\nBart spoke with such jolly carelessness, and such good humor, that his\r\nfun was contagious, and the Gaspereaugians burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter. Even the big fellow who had threatened him joined in the\r\nlaugh, and a murmur went round among them to the effect that this\r\nprisoner wasn’t a bad fellow.\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” said Bart, “Solomon, my sable friend, how do you feel?”\r\n\r\n“Tip top,” said Solomon, with a grin. “Solomon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, s’r.”\r\n\r\n“They’re going to tie us up tighter. They’re so afraid of us! Do you\r\nthink you can stand it?”\r\n\r\n“Stan it? Yes, s’r. ’Tain’t nuffin. All same to an ole niggar like me.\r\nI knows ebery one ob dem. I’m Gasperojum myself.”\r\n\r\n“Fellow-citizens,” said Bart, “and gentlemen of the Gaspereaux Valley,\r\nI appeal to your chivalry! Is it generous, or noble, or chivalrous, to\r\nbind the hands of my aged friend? I’ll give my word that he shan’t knock\r\ndown more than a dozen of you, if you let him loose. Come now, aren’t\r\nthere a dozen of you that will be willing to be knocked down for the\r\nsake of alleviating the woes of an aged, a virtuous, and an occasionally\r\nrheumatic African? Besides, you don’t know what he is. He’s not a common\r\nperson. He’s a Grand Panjandrum.”\r\n\r\n“O, you Panjer danjer yerself, an see how you like it!” growled the big\r\nGaspereaugian, who felt some slight fear that Bart was making fun of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“See here,” said Bart; “since you’ve tied us up, hadn’t you better tie\r\nup that basket of provisions, too? If you haven’t got any cord, you may\r\ntake what I have.”\r\n\r\nThis was received with roars of laughter, to which Bart listened with\r\nunaltered placidity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Bart had been speaking, he had been trying his fetters,\r\nand found them not so tight but that he could work his hands free. His\r\njests about their tying his hands made the Gaspereaugians ashamed to\r\nsecure them more tightly. Some of them, indeed, were in favor even\r\nof untying him. But Bart had been hurriedly bound, and his hands\r\nwere small, so that to slip them through the bonds was not a work of\r\ndifficulty. He soon found out this, but kept his own counsel, and held\r\nhis hands rigidly behind him, as though they were bound too tightly to\r\nbe moved. As he spoke he looked all around watchfully, so as to see his\r\nchances of escape. To slip his hands was easy whenever he chose. Had it\r\nbeen himself alone that was concerned, he would have made a dash into\r\nthe woods, and could have easily eluded pursuit. But he could not leave\r\nSolomon; and so he waited in the hope that some favorable juncture might\r\narrive when he could free his companion also.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugians now led them away across the brook that ran by\r\nthe camp and took up their station on the other side, on that smooth,\r\ngrass-grown slope which has already been mentioned. Bart and Solomon\r\nwere put inside of a half-finished hut of spruce, which some of the boys\r\nhad been building. Through the interstices of the branches they could\r\nsee the camp of the “B. O. W. C.” perfectly well. It was not far away,\r\nand the Gaspereaugians were debating whether to go and pull it down now,\r\nor to wait until some more boys might come.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this debate, Bruce came upon the scene, with his\r\ncompanions; and they, after looking hastily around, had found themselves\r\nin the presence of the invading host. There stood Bruce in full view of\r\nBart and Solomon; his brows lowering darkly and menacingly, and a stern\r\ninterrogation in his face, before which the Gaspereaugians as first\r\nseemed to quail.\r\n\r\n“What do you want here, you fellows?” said Bruce, at last.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply for nearly a minute. The eyes of all the\r\nGaspereaugians were fixed upon the speaker, but no one answered.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Bart, finding himself unobserved, slipped his hands out\r\nof their bonds, and quickly untied those of Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Now, Sol,” he said, “there’s going to be a row. This is our chance.\r\nWhen I start, you follow. But don’t start till I do. Mind, now!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, s’r,” said Solomon, with his usual grin. “I’m yours till\r\ndef,--slave or free,--live or dead,--sure’s a gun,--an ebber faitful!”\r\n\r\nAnd now Bart looked all around, waiting for a chance to start.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugians had forgotten all about their prisoners. Other things\r\nfar more exciting presented themselves. There stood Bruce; and once more\r\nhis lordly and imperious voice rang out,--\r\n\r\n“What are you fellows doing here? Away with you all--every one of you!”\r\n\r\nBruce was tall, and broad-shouldered, and stout, and muscular. His hat\r\nsat loosely on his head, and his hair clustered in careless curls about\r\nhis broad forehead. His eyes seemed to flash, and his thin nostrils\r\nquivered with disdain. He looked like a statue of Apollo, as he stood\r\nthere, in the glow of his youthful strength and beauty, and faced down\r\nhis enemies. Their very numbers, instead of overawing him, only served\r\nto rouse to the utmost the whole vigor of his soul, and stirred up his\r\nproud, bold spirit to a scornful self-assertion.\r\n\r\nA movement now took place among the Gaspereaugians, and murmurs passed\r\nthrough them. At length the big fellow who had been so fierce with Bart\r\nwent forward from out the crowd of his companions, to the place where\r\nBruce was standing by the pool of the camp. He was a big, hulking,\r\nclumsy, low-browed fellow, with a heavy gait and sullen face. He was\r\ntaller and stouter than Bruce, and evidently considered himself the\r\nchampion of his party. As he approached, Bruce stood, with folded arms,\r\nregarding him, while his lips curled into a smile.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, in a gay and careless tone, “what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\nThe big fellow clambered up the dam, and stood in front of Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Whar’s Bruce Rawdon?” he said, looking round, and pretending not to\r\nknow that he was there before him. “Whar’s this Bruce Rawdon that youns\r\nbrag on? Put him down here, fur I want to hev a trial with him--I want\r\nto wrastle.”\r\n\r\n“My good fellow,” said Bruce, “I’m Bruce Rawdon, and I’m quite at your\r\nservice. Only you are mistaken if you think that we brag on any one.\r\nWe’re not a bragging camp.”\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugian looked at him, and made a ridiculous grimace.\r\n\r\n“So this is Bruce Rawdon!” said he--“this here! Wal, Rawdon, let’s\r\nwrastle. We’ll decide who’s the best man. On’y take care of your\r\nclose, my fine feller. I’m generally considered rough. Yes, rough as a\r\nbar,--that’s what I be.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Bruce, quietly, and in a minute he had flung off his\r\nhat, coat, and waistcoat.\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep my duds on,” said the Gaspereaugian; “on’y that--that’s by\r\nway of defyin’.”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this he flung his hat on the ground.\r\n\r\nUpon this the two champions prepared to grapple.\r\n\r\nThe place where they stood was a grass plot on one side of the pool.\r\nThe pool was full to the brim. The “B. O. W. C.” stood on the dam. The\r\nGaspereaugians stood about twenty paces off. It was a moment of intense\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds they stood with extended arms, warily regarding one\r\nanother. Then Bruce made a plunge forward, and before the other could\r\nguard against it, he had caught him around the waist, under his arms.\r\n\r\nBruce had got the “underhold.”\r\n\r\nThe two were now locked in a close embrace, and for a few moments the\r\nbig Gaspereaugian made tremendous efforts to throw his antagonist. But\r\nthe efforts were unsuccessful. Bruce did not exert himself much, but\r\nquietly evaded the efforts of the other, and still held his adversary in\r\nan unrelaxing grasp.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugians now began to look anxious. Bruce’s face was so calm,\r\nhis action was so quiet, he seemed to make so little effort in spite of\r\nthe immense exertions of his antagonist, that he appeared to show some\r\nvast reserve of strength in store, ready to be put forth at some sudden\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspereaugian was, in truth, a big, burly fellow, whose muscles had\r\nbeen developed by a life of hard labor on a farm; but he was slow, and\r\nclumsy, and ignorant of all skill in wrestling. Now, Bruce was an adept\r\nin almost every active sport; while his limbs were so admirably knit,\r\nand his muscular development was so splendid, that even on the score of\r\nbrute strength he soon gave evidence that he overmatched the other; at\r\nthe same time, he made it apparent that his strength was only half put\r\nforth. The Gaspereaugians grew more anxious every moment, while Arthur,\r\nTom, and Phil, who had never for an instant doubted the result, felt\r\ntheir excitement increasing to an unendurable degree.\r\n\r\nBruce soon showed what his idea had been in these manoeuvres. He had now\r\nworked himself around, so that his back was towards the pool, and the\r\nGaspereaugian had made one violent effort to push him in backwards.\r\nIt was in vain. Bruce stood like a rock. Then suddenly, as the\r\nGaspereaugian’s efforts slackened somewhat, Bruce flung his right\r\narm around him lower down, and by one quick and tremendous effort of\r\nstrength raised him up into the air. In an instant the fellow’s legs\r\nspun upward; he appeared to turn a back summerset, and then,--down\r\nhe went, all sprawling, on his back, with his arms and legs extended\r\nwildly, straight into the pool!\r\n\r\n                   “No sound of joy or sorrow\r\n\r\n                        Arose from either bank,\r\n\r\n                   But friends and foes, in dumb surprise,\r\n\r\n                   With parted lips and straining eyes,\r\n\r\n                        Stood gazing where he sank.”\r\n\r\nThus far the two prisoners had remained in confinement. They might\r\neasily have escaped; their hands were free, and no one was paying any\r\nattention to them, but they remained there. Solomon would not go till\r\nBart led the way; and Bart was too tremendously excited by the struggle\r\nto think of moving. He stood there rooted to the spot, staring\r\nwith intense interest. At last the end came, and as Bart saw the\r\nGaspereaugian’s legs go tossing up, and saw him fall splashing into the\r\npool, he touched Solomon, and, followed by him, he darted into the thick\r\nshrubbery. The basket of provisions stood there neglected; this Bart\r\nseized as he passed, and gave it to Solomon. After this they made a\r\ncircuit to get to the camp.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the discomfited wrestler had scrambled to his feet in the pool\r\nof water, and stood for a time up to his waist, sputtering, blowing,\r\nand gasping for breath. The boys stood looking on; and Bruce watched him\r\nquietly, not knowing whether the struggle would be renewed or not.\r\nBut the Gaspereaugian did not make any advances towards resuming the\r\nconflict. He himself had been foiled so completely in his most desperate\r\nefforts, and the tremendous strength of those arms which had raised\r\nhim in the air and flung him into the pool was so formidable to his\r\nimagination, that he was not at all inclined for another trial. The one\r\ntrial had sufficed. So he slouched off, with his sulky face bent down,\r\nand soon joined his crestfallen companions.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he joined them than a shout was heard near the camp. Bruce\r\nand the other boys turned, and, to their delight and surprise, saw Bart\r\nand Solomon, with the basket of provisions.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Arthur; “why, Bart, we were afraid you’d come to grief.”\r\n\r\n“So we did,” said Bart; “we were captured--we’re escaped prisoners of\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n“Captured! Prisoners of war!” cried Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“About an hour ago we came up and fell into an ambush.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you manage to get away?”\r\n\r\nUpon this Bart told them all about it, and his story was received with\r\nunbounded delight, and gave rise to no end of fun. What was best was,\r\nthe fact, not merely that they had escaped, but that they had brought\r\noff the basket also in safety.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bart looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n“Brethren of the ‘B. O. W. C.,’” said he, “it’s only sixteen minutes\r\nafter four. Thus, after so many adventures,--after ambushes, fights, and\r\ncaptivities,--we have succeeded in keeping our appointment, and are not\r\nmore than sixteen minutes behind time.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Solomon carried the basket into the camp, and the others\r\nfollowed, and prepared to take their lunch as coolly as if nothing had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the Gaspereaugians. It was a bitter mortification\r\nfor them to witness the defeat of their companion; it was equally\r\naggravating to see their prisoners reach their friends, carrying with\r\nthem their basket; and all this reached its climax when they saw the\r\nquiet preparations for a lunch.\r\n\r\nThey stood in that state of mind and body which is expressed by the\r\nremarkable word--dumb-foundered.\r\n\r\nBut what could they do?\r\n\r\nHostilities did not seem to be very attractive now, for the defeat of\r\ntheir champion had greatly changed the aspect of affairs. To stand\r\nthere stupidly looking on was also not quite the thing. They had come to\r\nindulge in a general triumph over the school--and this was the end! They\r\nhesitated for some time, and stood in doubt.\r\n\r\nBut their indecision was at last ended. Their champion walked off\r\nsilently and sulkily; and they, seeing the leader go, slowly filed away\r\nafter him. And so--\r\n\r\n_Exeunt omnes Gaspereaugienses!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_A Banquet begun, but suddenly interrupted.--The far-off Boar.--Off in\r\nSearch of it.--Keeping Watch at the old French Orchard.--Another\r\nBoar, and another Chase.--Soliloquies of Solomon.--Sudden, amazing,\r\nparalyzing, and utterly confounding Discovery.--One deep, dark, dread\r\nMystery stands revealed in a familiar but absurd Form._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys now began a very pleasant repast in their camp. Solomon had,\r\nas usual, done justice to the occasion. He had chickens, turkeys, mince\r\npies, and other articles too numerous to mention. The boys had enough\r\nto talk about; for Bart had to narrate again the story of his captivity,\r\nand Bruce had to give an account of their wanderings through the valley\r\nof the Gas-pereaux.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the invading host was viewed by the boys without any\r\ndemonstrations of excitement whatever. They tried to act as though they\r\nwere perfectly indifferent to their movements; and having gained the\r\nsolid results of a victory, they did not care to heighten its brilliancy\r\nby any vain display of triumph. The triumph that was in their hearts was\r\nenough. They knew also that the Gas-pereaugians would feel an additional\r\nmortification when they reached home; for then they would there learn\r\nthat Bruce and his party had penetrated to the very centre of their\r\nterritory, and had virtually done defiance by lingering so long by the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nBy that memorable exploit the camp in the woods had now become\r\nhallowed. Henceforth it was to bear in their eyes the charm of historic\r\nassociations. They felt that their labor in building it had not been\r\nin vain. In truth it was a pleasant spot; and apart from any other\r\nassociations, its own quiet beauty was sufficient to give it strong\r\nattractions. Its walls arose above them, surmounted by its roof, all\r\ninterwoven with the fragrant, balsamic branches of fir trees. They had\r\nchosen fir in preference to others for the reason that the spines of the\r\nfir branches will cling for months before drooping; whereas the hemlock,\r\nthe spruce, the pine, and most other trees of that kind, are of such a\r\nnature that their spines will not cling to the severed branch for much\r\nmore than a week. And here were the dark green walls, cool, and shadowy,\r\nand fragrant. Over the floor was a thick, deep carpeting of soft moss,\r\nsuitable for a seat, or for a couch. Outside, all the scene was shut in\r\nby the lofty trees which bordered the little dell. Just behind them the\r\nbrook bubbled and babbled over rocks and pebbles, till it fell into\r\n‘the pool. The pool itself, their handiwork, was not the least of\r\nthe attractions. Its waters were deep enough to bathe in, and made a\r\npleasant contrast to those surrounding trees which it reflected in its\r\nmirrorlike surface. Farther down, the brook passed on, bordered on one\r\nside with trees, and on the other by that grassy knoll where late the\r\nbeleaguering Gaspereaugians had stood. On it went, past the trees, past\r\nthe knoll, through underbrush and mosses, until at length it was lost\r\nto view in the forest. But amid all these beauties, the one object which\r\nwas dearest to the “B. O. W. C.” was that which they had fixed over the\r\ndoor as at once a memorial of the past and a stimulus to adventurous\r\ndeeds in the future. It was the jaw of the big fish. They had for a\r\nwhile been undecided as to its destination, and were on the point of\r\ngiving it to the Museum, but at last decided on placing it there. There\r\nit accordingly was, grinning pleasantly with its triangular teeth, and\r\ninviting every one to enter.\r\n\r\nThus they were seated at their lunch, with Solomon a little apart,\r\nlooking at them like a father, engaged in pleasing conversation upon\r\nall the topics which their recent varied adventures might suggest,\r\nrecounting the past, enjoying the present, and speculating on the\r\nfuture, when suddenly there came an interruption, which in a moment put\r\na full stop to everything.\r\n\r\nIt was a distant sound.\r\n\r\nNow a distant sound must have been very peculiar to have caused such\r\nexcitement as this.\r\n\r\nVery well--this was very peculiar.\r\n\r\nIt was a harsh, dissonant roar, a noise, in fact, that could not be\r\ncalled a roar exactly, but something half way between a roar and a\r\nhowl, repeating itself over and over, and pealing from afar upon their\r\nstartled ears in tremendous echoes. There was no mistaking that sound.\r\nIt was the same as the one that had so startled them on the memorable\r\nnight of the money-digging, and had sent them flying in confusion from\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nThe boys all looked at one another with glances of deep meaning. Not one\r\nof them was frightened now. Solomon was only curious; in him the broad\r\nday destroyed any superstitious feeling. Had it been dark, he would have\r\nbeen as terrified as he was before.\r\n\r\nThe noise was repeated over and over as they listened, and at last it\r\nceased. It sounded like the conglomeration of the bellow of a bull, the\r\nroar of a lion, the yell of a madman, and the shriek of a steam-whistle,\r\nintermixed with other harsh and discordant noises that can scarcely be\r\ndefined; and the whole result was one which can certainly not be likened\r\nto anything at all.\r\n\r\n“That settles it!” said Bart at last.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve been giving the Gaspereaugians the credit of that row at\r\nthe money-hole, and when they came to-day I was certain of it; but this\r\nshows that they could have had nothing to do with it. It’s over there,\r\nbetween us and the Academy, and sounds now in the direction of the\r\nmoney-hole.”\r\n\r\n“Now’s the time to find it out,” said Bruce. “I was going to propose\r\na watch to-night, to see if we could get at the bottom of it. This is\r\nlucky, for we can examine it by daylight.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the very same noise,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“O, there’s no doubt about it,” said Phil, “only it’s farther off. That\r\nnight the roar seemed to burst forth just behind me. It’s the same in\r\nkind, only less in degree, as Mr. Simmons says.”\r\n\r\n“Come along then, boys,” said Bart, “Don’t let’s lose any time. It must\r\nbe somewhere about the old French orchard. Hurry up!” and with these\r\nwords they all started off.\r\n\r\n“De gracious!” cried Solomon. “Where you gwine to? You won’t find\r\nnuffin. Dem sorts ob tings don’t ’low derselves to be caught, mind, I\r\ntell you! Come back, chil’en, an finish yer dinna, an don’t go actin.\r\nAn me’s been a cookin for you like all possessed. What’s to become ob an\r\nole darky ef you won’t eat? Dis heah ain’t de proppa conduc fur de Bee\r\nSee Double. I’ll frow up my office. I won’t be a Granpander any longer.”\r\n\r\nBut the boys hurried away, and Solomon’s voice sounded upon the\r\nempty air. Thereupon he began collecting the dishes and eatables, and\r\nreplacing them in his basket.\r\n\r\nLeaving Solomon thus, the boys hurried on in a state of great\r\nexcitement. The mystery had thus far weighed heavily on all their\r\nspirits. In Bruce it may have been superstitious feeling which made it\r\noppressive to him; but in the others it was the mortification of their\r\nretreat and panic, and the unpleasantness of not being able to account\r\nfor the cause. The sounds, as far as they could judge, seemed to come\r\nfrom the old French orchard; but Bruce insisted that it issued from the\r\nwoods. This formed the subject of loud debate among them as they went\r\non. The majority, however, were against Bruce, and thought that it was\r\nfarther away than the limit of the woods.\r\n\r\n“Can it be any of the boys, after all?” said Bart, as they went along\r\nthe path. “Can Pat have in his possession any very remarkable kind of\r\nfish-horn or fog-horn?”\r\n\r\n“Pat? Nonsense!” said Arthur. “Do you think that any power of Pat’s\r\ncould produce such a noise?”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know. He may have a private pocket steam engine, and\r\noccasionally let off steam to amuse himself.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to hunt farther than Pat,” said Bruce, seriously.\r\n\r\n“Why, man alive!” cried Bart; “you don’t think now that there’s anything\r\nin it--do you?”\r\n\r\nBruce said nothing.\r\n\r\nThey all hurried along the path, peering into the woods as they went on,\r\nand listening for a renewal of the sound.\r\n\r\nBut there was none.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the gully, and, crossing it, they ascended the\r\nsteep slope on the other side. This brought them to the old French\r\norchard, and to the very cellar which had been the scene of their\r\nmemorable midnight operations. Looking down into the cellar, they could\r\nsee the traces of their work very plainly. They had filled in the hole\r\nas well as they could, but the ground bore visible marks of having been\r\nturned up.\r\n\r\n“If any of the fellows have been up here,” said Bart, “they must have\r\nnoticed this.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think that follows,” said Phil. “They wouldn’t notice it, in my\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\n“O, don’t you believe that. The marks of digging there are enough to\r\nmake any fellow notice them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what if they do?” said Bruce. “They’ll never think that we had\r\nanything to do with it. So we needn’t bother our heads about that.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Arthur, “none of them have been up here since they\r\ngot back. Bogud and Billymack have been studying; Pat has been occupied\r\non the hill; and the others have taken to the dikes. We’re the only\r\nfellows that have been here at all.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Bart, “I should like to try that hole again. I don’t\r\nbelieve there’s anything there, but at the same time I don’t like to\r\nleave a thing unfinished, especially where it’s been broken off the way\r\nthis was. And what’s more, I’m bound to have another turn at it.”\r\n\r\n“And so am I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be there,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, I’ll be there, too,” said Bruce, “and we’ll omit Solomon\r\nthis time, and Captain Corbet. We may as well do it by daylight.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Bart, “it’s all humbug to dig at night. It’s ten times\r\nas much trouble, and then we lose our sleep. We can come up early some\r\nmorning and do it. At the same time, I’m glad we had that night. It’s\r\nsomething to look back upon.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all very well,” said Phil; “but I’d like to know why we can’t\r\nhear that noise again. If it came from this hole, or from the old French\r\norchard, now’s the time for it. Here we are all ready. So roar away,\r\nsomebody!”\r\n\r\nThey all sat down now on the grass, and listened for a while in silence.\r\nThey could look over the gully on one side, and part of the play-ground\r\non the other. On three sides the woods encircled them. Running along\r\nthe play-ground on one side, where the woods ended was a pasture field\r\nbelonging to Dr. Porter. This pasture field could not be seen from the\r\nplace where they were.\r\n\r\nThey sat here for some time, waiting for the sound to arise again; and\r\nas they sat here, Solomon emerged from the woods, climbed the slope,\r\nand advanced towards them. He had replaced all the dishes and all the\r\nprovisions in the basket, and was now carrying it back. “Dar,” he said,\r\nas he put it down. “It beats me. Don’t see de use, no how, fur an ole\r\ndarky to go an broil his ole brack head off cookin and roastin all sorts\r\nob tings if dey won’t be eaten. An tings, too, what got captured by de\r\nGasperojums! An what we skewered safe back out ob dere plunderin bans!\r\nBesides,--blubbed bruddren, if you don’t eat my tings I feel kind o’\r\nslighted--I feel it a pusnul insult. Dat’s so.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, Solomon, you know why we cleared out. So you’ve brought the\r\nbasket. Well, why can’t we go to work here? Come, boys, let’s rise\r\nsuperior to circumstances, and finish our lunch.” Bart’s proposal was\r\ngreeted with a shout of joy, and once more Solomon, grinning with pride\r\nand delight, spread out before them his dishes and eatables.\r\n\r\nThey had just begun; they had just lifted to their still hungry and\r\nunsatisfied mouths a morsel or two, selected from among the dainties\r\nspread out by Solomon; they had just become familiar once more with\r\nthe delicious flavor of some of his pet dishes,--when suddenly, without\r\nwarning, and altogether unexpectedly, there burst forth again that roar\r\nfor which they had been waiting so long. Harsh, dissonant, ferocious,\r\nresonant in its bellowing intonations, it burst upon their ears, now\r\nmuch nearer than when they had heard it at the camp, and seeming very\r\nnearly as loud as it had been on that eventful night. The sound\r\nalso seemed to come from Dr. Porter’s pasture field. One moment they\r\nlistened--that moment assured them of the true direction. The next\r\nmoment they flung down their plates, and knives, and forks; and away\r\nthey went, like madmen, over the field towards the pasture.\r\n\r\nSolomon slowly rose to his feet and looked after them, with his head\r\nbent a little forward, and his hands clasped before him.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well!” he ejaculated, while an expression of unutterable\r\ndisgust came over his dark face. “Well, well, well! ob all de contrairy\r\nchil’en dat I ebber _did_ see! Nebber in de gracious sakes does dey know\r\nwhen dere well off. Heah’s de second time dey pitch dere dinnas away. An\r\nwhat dat dinna cost me--ob trouble and hard work! But, O, dear, down it\r\ngoes--O, yes--jes so--flung it all away--an leab dis ole nigga to\r\npick all it up agen. Pity de Gasperojums didn’t keep de basket. Dey’d\r\n’preciate de dinna, any how--dat’s so. ’Tain’t de trouble,” he\r\ngrumbled on, as he picked up the things again, and put them in the\r\nbasket,--“’tain’t dat--no, sir. It’s de want ob ’preciation. Collud\r\nfolks likes to be ’preciated. So does white folks. Dar’s de doctor. Me\r\nan him likes to be ’preciated,--but dis sort ob ting’s not ’greeble.\r\nDe day’ll come when dey’ll like to hab one ob ole Solomon’s dinnas.”\r\n\r\nSo he went on, picking up the things, growling and grumbling to himself\r\nall the time, until at length he had filled the basket again, and went\r\noff in the direction where the boys had gone, to see what had become of\r\nthem, and with a vague idea that the “dinna” would be resumed somewhere\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nHe found the boys over in the pasture field, looking a little mystified.\r\n\r\nThe noises had ceased. A few cows were quietly grazing; and among them\r\nwas an animal which was very familiar by name, but which none of them\r\nhad ever before seen in the flesh. It was a simple, domestic animal,\r\nin some countries the most common of all; but to these boys it was a\r\nnovelty. How it had got here was also a wonder; for they had no idea\r\nthat it was here, and in their surprise they forget about the noises.\r\n\r\nAnd what kind of an animal might this have been?\r\n\r\nA quiet, a domestic, agreeable animal; in fact, only a little donkey.\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” said Bart, as he came up, “who owns the donkey?”\r\n\r\n“De doctor,” said Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Why, how in the world did he happen to get one?”\r\n\r\n“He bought him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what did he want of it?”\r\n\r\n“O, for de chil’en to play with.”\r\n\r\n“That’s queer. I didn’t know there was one.”\r\n\r\n“O, you see de doctor got him de time you was off on de scursium. Ole\r\nscissa grinda come long, an de doctor bought de donkey. Ole scissa\r\ngrinda beat de donkey so, dat de doctor got him, an means to keep him\r\nfor de chil’en. Dat’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Poor old Neddy,” said Bart. “He’s pretty lean. But he’s all right now.\r\nThis will be a Paradise for him. But I say, boys--I wonder how he rides.\r\nI’ve never been on a donkey’s back in my life. Have you?”\r\n\r\n“And I never saw one before,” said Bruce. “I can’t say I admire him\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“Well, neither did I, for that matter,” said Bart; “and for that very\r\nreason I want to have a ride on him.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bart went up to the donkey. The patient animal did not\r\nmove, but calmly went on eating a delicious thistle that was under his\r\nnose. Bart got on his back. The donkey ate on, apparently unconscious of\r\nthe weight. Bart caught hold of his long ears, and tried to pull up his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBut the donkey ate on!\r\n\r\nThen Bart slapped his flanks with his hands.\r\n\r\nBut the donkey ate on!\r\n\r\nThen Bart kicked him vigorously with his heels.\r\n\r\nBut the donkey ate on!\r\n\r\nThen he whistled, and shouted, and pulled his ears, and kicked at him,\r\nand mixed all sorts of encouraging words with acts of the most violent\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut the donkey ate on!\r\n\r\nThat donkey seemed to be about the most phlegmatic animal that they had\r\never met with. Bart was in despair. He looked over the field to see if\r\nthere was a stick lying about anywhere. He asked the boys if they could\r\nsee one. He now sat still, for a short time, on the donkey’s back,\r\nwaiting till he should find a stick.\r\n\r\nWhile he was seated thus the donkey slowly lifted his head.\r\n\r\nHe had finished that thistle, and felt refreshed.\r\n\r\nSlowly he elevated his head; slowly he threw back his ears; slowly also\r\nhe elevated his tail; until at last his nose was directed towards a\r\npoint about twelve degrees above the northern horizon, and his tail to\r\nanother point about eleven degrees above the southern.\r\n\r\nThen he spread all his legs apart.\r\n\r\nThen he opened his mouth.\r\n\r\nThen:--\r\n\r\n_Hee haw! Hee Haw!! Hee Haw!!!\r\n\r\nHaw haw 1 Hawwwww! Heee!\r\n\r\nHee haw! Heee! Haaaaw!\r\n\r\nHee-haw! Hee-haw! Haw!\r\n\r\nHee! Haw! Hee! Haw!\r\n\r\nHee! Haw! Hee! Haw!\r\n\r\nH-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E I H-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-w!_\r\n\r\nBart sprang from his back.\r\n\r\nThe other boys started and looked at one another in utter amazement.\r\n\r\nOne mystery was at last revealed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_Irrepressible Outburst of Feeling from the Grand Panjandrum.--He\r\nenlarges upon the Dignity of his Office.--Spades again.--Digging\r\nonce more.--At the old Place, my Boy.--Resumption of an unfinished\r\nWork.--Uncovering the Money-hole.--The Iron Plate.--The Cover of the\r\nIron Chest--A Tremendous but restrained Excitement._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCH, then, was the explanation of the mystery of the discordant, the\r\nhideous roar. To those who have heard the bray of a donkey it will be\r\nintelligible how such a noise, sounding suddenly in the still midnight,\r\nto inexperienced ears may have been full of terror; while to those who\r\nhave not heard it, a simple assertion of the above fact will, it\r\nis hoped, be all that is necessary. It was the donkey’s bray which,\r\naccording to the fable, terrified the animals of the forest, after he\r\nhad put on the lion’s skin. Now, this donkey was clothed in something\r\nmore dreadful than a lion’s skin: he was clothed in the darkness and the\r\ngloom of night, and his roar might well terrify those who heard it under\r\nsuch circumstances, without knowing whence it came.\r\n\r\nAfter the first surprise they all burst into a roar of laughter. It\r\nwas an immense relief to them all; but their merriment was a little\r\nintermingled with feelings of shame, as the dark and dreadful mystery\r\nthus resolved itself into the ridiculous form of a poor little donkey.\r\n\r\nAs for Solomon, the effect produced on him was greater than on the\r\nothers. As the first peal of the bray struck his ears, he started, his\r\njaw dropped, his eyes rolled up. Then, as the whole truth came to him,\r\nhe dashed his hat to the ground, threw his head back, and burst into\r\na perfect thunder-peal of laughter. There he stood, while the donkey\r\nbrayed, swinging his aged frame and his grizzled head backward and\r\nforward, tossing his arms, and at last holding his aching sides.\r\n\r\nAnd it was,--“O, dis sight! De jackass! O, de gracious sakes! Shades an\r\npowers ob darkness! Sich _a_ succumstance! An’ dis nigga a gwine mad\r\nwid feah about _dat!_ An all de blubbed breddern ob de Double bubble: de\r\nmos’ wossfle, de patrick, de venebubble wodden, an all de ress, a flyin\r\non de heels ob de Granjer pander drum! wid a small jackass a chasin all\r\ndem high an’ mighty ’ficials! Tinkin him de vengin sperrit ob a ole\r\nCajian slashin an swingin a pot ob gold ober our bressed heads! O, dis\r\nerf alive! Nebber did dis nigga spec to fin out sich _a_ succumstance!\r\nAn de stonishing way we _did_ put! Gracious! how my ole heels did kick\r\nup! Reglar ravin stracted wid terror we was; mind, I tell you! An dar\r\ncome a juvenile jackass out ob de wood to devour us up! Say, blubbed\r\nbreddern, whar’s dat ar minral rod? Spose you get dat ar stick for a\r\nridin whip; wonder ef ’twouldn’t make dat ar jackass gee up. Tell you\r\nwhat now, Mas’r Bart, you jest get on dat ar animal’s back wid Mas’r\r\nBruce, an’ sing one or two ob dem dar cantations, an de rest ob you get\r\nsome magic candles an set fire to de top knot on de end ob dat ar tail.\r\nTell you what, dat’ll make him gee up--will so! Yah! yah! yah! yah! yah!\r\nYe-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-p!”\r\n\r\n“Solomon, my son,’ said Bart, as the old fellow, after giving a wild\r\nyell, was getting ready for another outburst.\r\n\r\n“Yes, mos wossfle,” said Solomon, with a grin. “Would it be too much to\r\nask you to be kind enough to allow us to finish our rustic repast? As it\r\nwas interrupted by the noise of this quadruped, we think that it would\r\nbe very desirable to resume it, unless you prefer remaining here for the\r\nrest of the day imitating the animal before us.”\r\n\r\n“All right, mos possible,” said old Solomon, catching up his basket.\r\n“Couldn’t help it. Had to let out strong. Bust if I hadn’t did so. Fust\r\nman dat mentions de name ob a donkey to me, dis ole niggall bust. Dat’s\r\nso!”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Solomon kicked up one leg, then slapped one hand down hard\r\non his knee, and stood for a moment with his head bent down, while his\r\nwhole frame shook with internal laughter. At length he raised his head,\r\nand presented to the view of the boys a face as grave, as demure, and\r\nas solemn as the visage of a judge who is about to pronounce a sentence,\r\nonly there was an irrepressible twinkle in each of his small black beads\r\nof eyes which took a little from the mask of gravity with which his face\r\nwas covered.\r\n\r\nThen he took up the basket, and walked back towards the old French\r\norchard. The boys passed him, reaching the cellar first. Then they all\r\nsat down again, and Solomon, for the third time, spread the table before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Dis heah,” said he, “chil’en, am de third and de lass time. Ef any ob\r\nyou runs away, he’ll lose his bressed dinna, now an forebbermore. Amen.\r\nSo you go ahead, an eat, fass as you can. De visions ain’t gwine to\r\nspile your ’gestions.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were hungry, and ate in silence. Solomon stood apart\r\nunobserved, with a broad grin on his face, occasionally muttering to\r\nhimself, and shaking all over with laughter. After each of these silent\r\nexplosions, he would suddenly recover his gravity, mutter to himself\r\nsome solemn rebuke, and look awfully grave for about half a minute, till\r\na new explosion came.\r\n\r\nThat discovery had been too much for him. He had seen the donkey when\r\nit came, but he had never heard it bray. The terror over him had been\r\ntremendous. Every night since then had been a night of fear, and it was\r\nthe violent revulsion of feeling from his former panic which brought on\r\nthis joyousness. It took him all the rest of the term to get over his\r\ntendency to burst forth on all occasions into fits of laughter.\r\n\r\nAt length the repast was over, and Solomon at last had the satisfaction\r\nof feeling that his efforts had been fully “’preciated.” The boys felt\r\nlike giants refreshed, and Solomon looked with great complacency upon\r\nthe bones of the fowls and the empty dishes.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s about de ticket,” he said, as he piled the dishes into the\r\nbasket. “Didn’t want to carry back such a hebby load to de ’Cad’my.\r\nBeen tuggin at it all day. Got to hurry back now.”\r\n\r\n“What, Solomon! you’re not going?” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Got to--must.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! We can’t spare you yet. We want to talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t spar de time now,--mos ’portant business. De doctor allus\r\nspecks me punct’ly. Got to get him his dinna. Dis is all very well for\r\n_play_; but business is business, an dat’s what me’n’ de doctor’s got\r\nto tend to. We’ve got de ’portant business ob life--de dinna\r\n’partment.”\r\n\r\n“O, he’ll get his dinner all right,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“What dat? He--de doctor--widout me!”\r\n\r\nSolomon rolled up his eyes till only the whites were visible, and stood\r\nlost in wonder at the preposterous idea.\r\n\r\n“Sich chil’en as you,” said he, loftily, “don’t ond’stan de serious\r\nbusiness ob life. Wait till you get to be sixty, an hab cooked as many\r\ndinnas as me; den you may talk.”\r\n\r\n“That’s hard for us,” said Tom, “if we have to become cooks and get to\r\nbe sixty.”\r\n\r\n“Course it is--an I mean it to hit hard. A dinna’s a dinna, an no\r\nmistake. Me’n’ de doctor knows dat. Why, whar’d de ’Cad’my be, ef\r\nI wasn’t to give de doctor a rail fust-rate dinna ebery day? Me’n’ de\r\ndoctor keep de ’Cad’my goin. He’s de mas’r, an I’m de one dat keeps\r\nhim a goin, an so we bofe ob us keep de ’Cad’my goin.”\r\n\r\n“Solomon,” said Arthur, “you ought to be one of the teachers.”\r\n\r\n“‘Teachas!” said Solomon; “ain’t I somefin more? What’s a teacha? I’m a\r\npro-fessa. I’m de ’fessa ob de cool an airy ’partment.”\r\n\r\n“Culinary,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Solomon; “cool an airy. Dat’s what de doctor said. Ses he,\r\n‘Solomon, you hab a ’portant ’sition,--you preside ober de cool an\r\nairy _‘partment_.’ ‘What’s dat ar?’ ses I. ‘O,’ ses he, ‘it’s only de\r\nInjin’ fur cookin.’ An I ups an tales him ef he’d ony stay down on\r\nsome broilin, hot day in Auguss in de kitchen, he’d’fess dat de Injin\r\nlangidgo didn’t spress de idee, ef it called sich a oven of a place\r\n‘cool an airy.’ Dat’s what I tale him,--an’ now, blubbed breddern,\r\nfarewell!”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Solomon took his basket, and retired from the scene.\r\n\r\n“There’s a great lot of these cellars about,” said Arthur at last, after\r\nsome silence, during which they had been sprawling on the grass beside\r\nthe cellar. “There’s a great lot of them. I wonder how many there are?”\r\n\r\n“O, two or three hundred, at least,” said Bruce; “perhaps more.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for my part,” said Bart, “I believe that there’s money buried in\r\nsome of them; and though our adventure was awfully ridiculous, yet that\r\ndoesn’t alter the sober fact, and I think the general belief is right.”\r\n\r\n“I go in for digging again,” said Phil. “I don’t believe in finding\r\nmoney, but we may find something.”\r\n\r\n“Bones, for instance,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Yes, bones, if you like; and then we’d give them to the museum.\r\nAnything at all would be acceptable. It would take the edge off our\r\ndisappointment of the other night.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a great deal in that,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like giving it up altogether,” said Bart. “We’ve begun\r\nit--let’s finish it.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s the hole,” said Tom, “inviting us to come along.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Bruce, “don’t you remember we struck something hard? and\r\nI _know_ it wasn’t a stone.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Arthur; “that’s a fact,--all our shovels touched it. We all\r\nheard the dull, ringing sound it gave. It was metal. Let’s go to work, I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“When?” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow morning,” said Phil, “early--”\r\n\r\n“No--I say _now_,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“So say I.”\r\n\r\n“And I.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Phil; “I say so, too. But what’ll we do for shovels?”\r\n\r\n“Do? Why, we can go and get some, I suppose,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“But won’t the fellows see us?”\r\n\r\n“What if they do?”\r\n\r\n“Why, they’ll wonder what we’re up to.”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“They’ll follow us, and see.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. We’re not going to work in secret this time. We’re working\r\nnow in broad day. We haven’t any mineral rod, nor any magic ceremonies.\r\nWe’re merely a plain, hard-working crowd; not of money-diggers, but of\r\narchaeologists. We’re not digging for pots of gold, but for curiosities\r\nand relics of the Acadian French. That’s our position now, my boy; and a\r\nvery much more dignified position it is than the one we occupied when we\r\nwere making fools of ourselves the other night.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Bruce, who felt more keenly than the others the shame of that\r\npanic, for the reason that he had been more deeply touched. Since then\r\nhe had, over and over again, vindicated his courage most nobly,\r\non occasions, too, when the exercise of that courage could only be\r\naccomplished by a supreme effort of his strong spirit; yet, in spite of\r\nthis, he felt galled at the recollection of that night, and could not\r\nallude to it without bitterness.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Phil, “if Jiggins, and Bogud, and the other lot are\r\nvery inquisitive, I’ll invite them up, and we can get them to do the\r\ndigging.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a very sensible way of viewing it,” said Bart. “Yes, that’s just\r\nwhat we’ll do. For my part, I’d rather have them come than not, for, if\r\nthey were to dig, our curiosity would be satisfied all the same, while\r\nour various muscles would not have to submit to such very violent\r\nexertion as is called forth by the unpleasant process of digging with a\r\nspade in such abominably hard ground.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Bart,” said Bruce, “as soon as you’ve taken breath after that\r\nlong-winded sentence, we’ll start.”\r\n\r\nUp jumped Bart at this, and the others followed his example.\r\n\r\nThey went down to the Academy and obtained spades and a pickaxe without\r\nany difficulty. Shouldering these they paraded about the yard, in the\r\nhope of attracting attention. But to their great disappointment they\r\ndidn’t attract any attention whatever. The boys were all away, some in\r\nfront, some out for a walk. So they came to the conclusion that they\r\nwould have to do their own digging.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Bart, as they walked back up the hill, “one comfort\r\nis, that we dug up the place before, and this time the ground will be\r\nsofter.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got the old pickaxe,” said Bruce, “all ready in case of need.”\r\n\r\n“Whether we find anything or not, it will satisfy our minds.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and then, you know, we can leave the hole open, and explain to\r\nthe others why we dug it. We can induce them also to do a little more\r\ndigging, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“But if we find anything there’ll be a still stronger temptation to\r\ndig.”\r\n\r\n“O, if we find anything, all the cellars in the place will be turned\r\ninside out.”\r\n\r\n“David Digg will have a chance to prove himself deserving of his name.”\r\n\r\n“What a joke it would be if Pat were to see us! He’d be wild with\r\ncuriosity, and follow us so as to see.”\r\n\r\n“O, there’s no danger. Nobody’ll come--that’s just because we want\r\nthem,” said Phil.\r\n\r\nChatting in this way they marched up the hill, back again to the old\r\nFrench orchard, which they reached without having attracted the smallest\r\nattention from anybody, and at length they all stood once more with\r\ntheir spades by the cellar. Very different was this occasion from the\r\nlast, and they all felt it so. The last had been one of pure fun and\r\nnonsense, disturbed, however, by the tremors of some of their number;\r\nthis time, on the contrary, was an occasion in which business seemed to\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nThey paused for a little while on the edge of the cellar, before\r\ncommitting themselves to their work.\r\n\r\nUpon this Bart began to whine out through his nose a doleful ditty, to\r\nthe tune of Auld Lang Syne.\r\n\r\n                   “Whene’er I take my walks abroad\r\n\r\n                        How many holes I see!\r\n\r\n                   But how they came upon the ground\r\n\r\n                        Completely puzzles me.\r\n\r\n                   “Here once the peaceful Frenchman dwelt,\r\n\r\n                        And passed his happy days\r\n\r\n                   In draining bogs, devouring frogs,\r\n\r\n                        And cultivating maize.\r\n\r\n                   “These holes, no doubt, were dug by him;\r\n\r\n                        We see them all around;\r\n\r\n                   And all Grand Pré to me appears\r\n\r\n                        A very holy ground.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what Captain Corbet would call a ‘hime,’” said Phil, with a\r\nlaugh. “It’s too solemn, Bart, for this occasion. We want something\r\nbusiness-like now.”\r\n\r\n“Then here goes,” said Bart, who had a happy talent for improvising.\r\nAnd he droned out the following, in a whining voice, but to a livelier\r\nmeasure:--\r\n\r\n                        “Over Minas’s Bay\r\n\r\n                        Came the French to Grand Pré,\r\n\r\n                   And they all were remarkable fellers;\r\n\r\n                        They lived upon frogs,\r\n\r\n                        And they wore wooden clogs,\r\n\r\n                   And preserved their potatoes in cellars.”\r\n\r\n“There,” said Arthur, “that’s enough, Bart. If we don’t stop you now,\r\nyou’ll go on till sundown. If we’re going to dig, we’d better begin, for\r\nit’s getting late, and it’ll be dark before we know it.”\r\n\r\n“All right, my son,” said Bart. “Here goes--come along.”\r\n\r\nAnd seizing his spade, he rushed down into the cellar; and plunging it\r\ndeep into the earth, he began to throw it out.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, Bart!” cried Bruce. “Dig away, old man! You’ll turn up the\r\nwhole cellar, at that rate, before we can get down. Leave something for\r\nus, though, just for the name of the thing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Come along,” cried Bart, throwing out his seventh shovelful.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were all at the hole, and plunged in their spades. Out\r\nflew the earth. In their zealous work the shovels clashed against one\r\nanother furiously, and rather impeded their progress; but in spite of\r\nthis, the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that contrasted in a\r\nvery striking manner with the slowness of their progress on that former\r\noccasion. Then, the earth was rigid, and hard bound with the turf\r\nthat had been accumulating for generations, and Bruce’s pickaxe had to\r\nprepare the-way for the slow entrance of their spades. But now, their\r\nspades went in easily, and the pickaxe as yet was not needed.\r\n\r\nBut the work of digging was an unusual one, and their violent efforts\r\nexhausted them before they had worked for a long time. They paused for a\r\nmoment and rested.\r\n\r\n“We’re almost at the bottom,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“That depends on what you mean by the bottom,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean, we’re almost as far down as we were before.”\r\n\r\n“But I wonder whether we shall strike that metallic substance that we\r\nstruck before,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I’ll soon see,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nSaying this, he took the pickaxe, and giving it a swing, brought it down\r\ninto the centre of the hole.\r\n\r\nIt penetrated a short distance, and then stopped short, with a low, dull\r\nsound, as though it had struck something hard.\r\n\r\nThat sound roused the boys once more, and stimulated them to fresh\r\nexertions. They again plunged their spades into the earth. All their\r\nfirst energy was now restored. They forgot their fatigue. Something was\r\nthere, they knew. What it was they could not tell; but they knew that it\r\nmust be the same thing that had excited them once before, and from which\r\nthey had been driven by the sudden bray of that absurd donkey. Now, all\r\nthat nonsense had been explained; and they knew that this last vestige\r\nof the mystery of that midnight hour lay beneath them, and would soon be\r\nexhumed and brought to the light of day.\r\n\r\nLower and lower they went.\r\n\r\nAnd now their shovels struck it at every stroke. It seemed metallic. The\r\ndull ringing sound given forth could not come from wood, or brick, or\r\nstone. It must be metal!\r\n\r\nBut what?\r\n\r\nWas it a pot, or an iron chest?\r\n\r\nPooh!\r\n\r\nAt any rate they were glad that the other fellow’s were not present. .\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts and feelings passed through their minds as they came down\r\nnearer to the object of their search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_Farther and farther down, and sudden Revelation of the Truth.--Rising\r\nsuperior to Circumstances.--The “Pot of Money,” and other\r\nburied Treasures.--They take all these exhumed Treasures to Dr.\r\nPorter.--Singular Reception of the excited Visitors._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN deep excitement they continued to dig in silence, and thus came\r\ngradually nearer to the object of their search. At last the loose earth\r\nwas all thrown out, and only the old hardbound soil was left; while\r\nthere, at the bottom of the cavity, lay exposed a portion of an iron\r\nsurface, dented now and scratched by the blows which it had received.\r\nIt was very rusty; the rust, in fact covered it in great scales, showing\r\nthat it must have been buried there for many years. As yet only a few\r\nsquare inches of the surface were visible, and it was impossible to tell\r\nas yet what it was. But they all felt sure that it was an iron chest.\r\n\r\nBruce now took his pickaxe, and began loosening the hard-bound earth\r\nthat surrounded the hole.\r\n\r\n“It’s lucky it’s so near the surface,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I suppose he hadn’t time to bury it any deeper,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Arthur; “he must have been hurrying off, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we won’t be able to lift it,” said Tom. “What’ll we do then?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to get Solomon and Captain Corbet,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“For that matter,” said Bart, “we can rig up blocks and pulleys, and\r\nhoist it up. We’ll have to dig all around it, though.”\r\n\r\n“We may not have it done to-night.”\r\n\r\n“If it’s very heavy, we won’t.”\r\n\r\n“But we must.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, it wouldn’t do to leave it till morning.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we get lights?”\r\n\r\n“If we do get lights, we’d better postpone it till midnight.”\r\n\r\n“But we ought to do as much as we can by daylight.”\r\n\r\n“O, of course, while the daylight lasts, we’ll keep at it.”\r\n\r\nBruce now laid down his pickaxe, and they went to work with their\r\nshovels, and at last the loose earth was thrown out once more. They had\r\nnow uncovered what seemed like one side of the top of the box, and\r\nits edge was plainly apparent. The rest of it was still covered by the\r\nsuperincumbent soil.\r\n\r\n“That’s the edge of the box,” said Bart. “We didn’t hit it fair in the\r\ncentre.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good-sized box, too.”\r\n\r\n“And it’ll be awfully heavy.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it is much larger.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better uncover the rest of it, so as to see the size of it. There\r\ndon’t seem to be any kind of rivets here, or anything of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“O, you can’t tell. It’s so covered with rust.”\r\n\r\n“Countersunk rivets on an iron plate would be quite concealed if they\r\nwere all covered with scales of rust.”\r\n\r\n“Come, I’ll dig more on this side,” said Bruce, taking up his pickaxe\r\nagain. A few blows directed against the other side served to loosen the\r\nearth there, and the eager boys soon threw it out, and laid bare more of\r\nthe surface. Bruce worked away with his pickaxe at the same time. There\r\nwas now room for only two to work. The others looked on with beating\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” cried Bruce, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Why, the top’s loose!”\r\n\r\n“Loose! Hurrah! We can lift it off then, and get into the box.”\r\n\r\nBruce said nothing, but stooped down. Bart, who had been digging,\r\nstooped down, too. The other boys crowded around.\r\n\r\nBruce dug his fingers into the earth by the edge of the iron, and\r\nrattled it with his hands. Then he tried to lift it up.\r\n\r\nIt moved!\r\n\r\nAs it moved, he worked his fingers underneath it, and raised it up on\r\nits edge.\r\n\r\nHe said not one word, but lifted it up, and held it before the eyes of\r\nthe “B. O. W. C.”\r\n\r\nAnd as they looked at it they were struck dumb, and stood paralyzed with\r\namazement and disgust.\r\n\r\nFor there, in Bruce’s hands, held up to the light of day, the iron\r\nlid of the iron money-chest, that coffer lid that concealed so much\r\ntreasure, buried long ago by the fugitive Frenchman, to be exhumed by\r\ntheir fortunate hands,--that iron lid which had been the source of so\r\nmuch excitement and hope, had resolved itself into nothing better than\r\n_a rusty old ploughshare!_\r\n\r\nAgain holding it till he was tired, Bruce handed it solemnly to Bart.\r\n\r\n“Here, Bart,” said he, “I’ll give all my share to you.”\r\n\r\n“And I present all that you give me and all my own to Tom,” said Bart,\r\ntaking it and passing it on to Tom.\r\n\r\nTom took it and handed it to Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I make it over to you, Arthur,” said he.\r\n\r\n“And I make it over to Phil,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nPhil took it.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said he. “I hereby give and bequeath all my right, title,\r\nand interest, in and to the said ploughshare, to the Academy Museum,\r\nits curators and officials, to have and to hold forevermore, amen, and\r\nanything to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys had recovered from their astonishment,\r\ndisappointment, and disgust.\r\n\r\n“That comes of being so sanguine,” said Bart. “Boys, why would you allow\r\nyourselves to grow so excited?”\r\n\r\n“Fancy a fugitive Acadian solemnly burying his plough.”\r\n\r\n“It was all he had, poor wretch, I dare say.”\r\n\r\n“But why bury it in his cellar? Why not in his potato field?”\r\n\r\n“For my part, I don’t believe in the Acadian French.”\r\n\r\n“I think they’re humbugs.”\r\n\r\n“And this is all that remains of the wealth of ‘Benedict Bellefontaine,\r\nthe wealthiest farmer in Grand Pré!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he intended it as a quiet hint to show those who were in a\r\nhurry to get rich the true source of wealth. The plough is that, you\r\nknow; so the copy-books all say, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad we’ve got even this. It makes archæologists of us. We’ll\r\nmake it a present to the Museum, The doctor’ll be delighted. Perhaps\r\nhe’ll give us an extra holiday. Every scale of rust will be precious\r\nin his eyes; and he’ll paste a nice label on it, with all our names\r\nimmortalized, and the date of the discovery. It will be the chief\r\ntreasure of the Museum. Where’ll David Diggs’s crystal be, or\r\nBillymack’s moss agate, or Jiggins’s petrifactions, beside our plough?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we couldn’t find something else, so as to make a handsome\r\nthing out of it. An old rusty nail would be better than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a capital idea,” cried Bruce, seizing his pickaxe again. “Never\r\nsay die, boys. We’ll go back covered with glory, after all, and our\r\nnames will be handed down to future generations of boys yet to come to\r\nthe old place.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bruce began working away once more with his pickaxe; and\r\nthe others, excited by this new idea, and the prospect of gaining some\r\nkind of a reward for all their toil, took their shovels again, and\r\nwaited till Bruce should loosen the earth sufficiently for them to dig\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt length this was done, and they began to shovel it out. They had not\r\nworked five minutes before Tom cried,--\r\n\r\n“Hallo! here’s something, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he stooped down and picked something out of the ground,\r\nwhich he showed the boys. They examined it eagerly, and saw that it was\r\na colter, probably belonging to the plough, from which the ploughshare\r\nhad been taken. Scarcely had he handed this to the boys than he saw\r\nlying at his feet an iron bolt. This encouraged them all the more. The\r\ncolter and the bolt were placed beside the ploughshare, and they worked\r\non vigorously, each one hoping to make some discovery of his own.\r\n\r\nIn a little while Bruce struck something, which, on examination, proved\r\nto be the end of a chain. After diligent labor he succeeded in detaching\r\nit all from the ground, and laid it down upon the grass. It was an ox\r\nchain, about six feet long.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, only increased their excitement; so they all went to\r\nwork again.\r\n\r\nAt last Phil, with all his strength, dragged something out of the\r\nground, and with a shout put it down beside the other things. It was\r\na small iron pot, which had been used for cooking. It was now full of\r\nearth, and Phil, seizing the colter, began to pick it out.\r\n\r\n“This is the famous pot,” cried Phil, with a laugh; “but the money\r\ninside has all turned to dust because we dug it in the daytime.”\r\n\r\n“Money?” cried Arthur. “Don’t laugh about money. What do you say to\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nAnd he held out on his open palm three very dirty coins. What they were\r\nthey could not tell, whether silver, or iron, or what. They looked like\r\nvery dirty round stones. The boys took them and examined them carefully.\r\nBart drew his knife, and scraped off the rust and canker.\r\n\r\n“More of old Benedict Bellefontaine,” said he, at last. “We can’t make\r\nanything out of him. See here!”\r\n\r\nAnd holding out the coin, he showed where he had scraped it. There they\r\ncould read, faintly marked, letters, which formed the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\nUN SOU\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were somewhat disappointed at this, and scraped the other coins,\r\nbut found them all copper.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Arthur; “what’s the odds? To an archaeologist isn’t a\r\ncopper coin as precious as a gold one? Of course it is. Hallo, Phil!\r\nHaven’t you got that pot cleaned out yet? I’ve got an idea. I’ll put\r\nthese sous in the pot, and then we can say that we’ve found a pot of\r\nmoney. We’ll be generous, too--we’ll give it all to the Museum.” Phil’s\r\npot by this time was empty, and Arthur laughingly threw the sous into\r\nit. After this they began their search again, and enlarged the hole\r\nin hopes of finding more around the sides. And in this they were\r\nsuccessful, for they found, near, a dozen more copper coins, which made\r\na very respectable appearance in the pot, and in addition to these,\r\nabout a dozen bits of iron--nails, spikes, and bolts.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, boys! look here!” cried Bart, suddenly. He held in his hand an\r\nold, discolored bone. “Talking about relics,” said he, “here’s a relic\r\nof the original owner. The question is though, is it a human bone?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Arthur; “it’s an ox bone, or a horse.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it,” said Bart. “I’m determined that it shall be Benedict\r\nBellefontaine.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a horse’s bone,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart; “I’ll keep it carefully, and let the doctor have it. It\r\nwill be the most precious article in the Museum.”\r\n\r\nIt was now growing too dark to work any longer. The sun had set, and\r\nthey were satisfied with the result of their labors. So they gathered\r\ntogether their treasures, and set out for the Academy.\r\n\r\nThese treasures seemed to them to be by no means despicable.\r\n\r\nThey were,--\r\n\r\n1 ploughshare,\r\n\r\n1 colter,\r\n\r\n4 bolts,\r\n\r\n1 chain,\r\n\r\n1 iron pot,\r\n\r\n3 nails,\r\n\r\n2 bits of iron,\r\n\r\n2 spikes,\r\n\r\n13 copper coins,\r\n\r\n1 bone.\r\n\r\nAnd any one who has ever been connected with a small museum, or has ever\r\nbeen acquainted with those who are connected with a valuable institution\r\nlike that, will easily understand the value of articles like these,\r\nexhumed direct from the cellar of an old Acadian house.\r\n\r\nThe boys felt no doubt whatever as to the value of their treasure. In\r\nfact, they grew so excited over it that they began at last to think\r\nwhat they had found far better than what they hoped to find; and so it\r\nresulted that those who had gone out to find gold came back rejoicing in\r\nrusty iron.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Academy they went at once to Dr. Porter’s house. They\r\nfound the doctor at home, and were ushered up at once to his study.\r\n\r\nThe boys said nothing, but gravely, and in impressive silence, laid down\r\ntheir treasures on the doctor’s study table. It was covered with books\r\nand papers; but they were too oblivious of every thing, and too much\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of their own things, to think of that.\r\n\r\nSo Bruce entered first, and placed on the doctor’s table, right over\r\nsome handsome volumes of Euripides, just received from London, the\r\nrusty, dirty old ploughshare.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” cried the doctor. “Why! what!--”\r\n\r\nBut before he could finish his sentence, Tom came up, and laid down a\r\ndozen old spikes and nails. Both of them turned and looked proudly at\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\n“Look here, boys,” cried the doctor, standing up; “what--”\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by Phil, who came forward between him and the first\r\nboys, carrying an iron pot, which he triumphantly placed on a handsomely\r\nbound Hebrew Lexicon.\r\n\r\n“What in the world--” began the doctor again, but was again interrupted\r\nby Arthur, who solemnly placed the colter on a new edition of Longinus,\r\nand then put the chain on some late English Quarterly Reviews. Just as\r\nthe doctor was about to burst forth, Bart came immediately before him,\r\nand, with a face radiant with delight, laid down, right on the doctors\r\nblotting pad, that horrible, discolored, and disintegrated old bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0173]\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed that the doctor would burst forth in a fury. To\r\nhim this behavior was the sublimity of unparalleled impudence; the act\r\nwas so absolutely unequalled in its quiet audacity, that it actually\r\nmade him dumb with amazement. The ploughshare, the colter, the iron\r\npot, the rusty spikes and bolts, the old chain,--all these were so\r\nmany stages up which his astonishment went to a climax which was fully\r\nattained when Bart put down the abominable old bone.\r\n\r\nThis was too much.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor burst forth.\r\n\r\nBut not in fierce and furious indignation, and vehement and violent\r\ndenunciation. It struck him in another way. It was his sense of the\r\nridiculous that was affected. He forgot the ruin done to his precious\r\neditions of the classics, and his mind could only grasp the innocent,\r\nsmiling faces of these five young rascals who had come into the awful\r\nseclusion of his own study to pile up his inviolable study table with\r\nold iron and old bones.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the doctor burst forth into an uncontrollable fit\r\nof laughter,--not a common laugh, but one which was sent forth from\r\nthe very depths of his nature,--all absorbing, overwhelming. Peal after\r\npeal, irrepressible. It was contagious, too. The boys caught it. They\r\ntried to restrain themselves at first. They tittered. They began to see\r\nthemselves the absurdity of their act. The thought overcame them, and\r\nthey all burst forth, too. The whole company thus went off into fearful\r\nexplosions--cataclysms, in fact, of laughter.\r\n\r\nIt roused the house.\r\n\r\nThe family came running up to see the cause.\r\n\r\nThe doctor could not utter a word. Tears were running from his eyes; he\r\ncould only point in silence to the old iron and old bone. The contagion\r\nseized upon the family also, and they all went off into the general\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nAt length the boys took the things off the table, and put them on the\r\nfloor. Gradually the doctor recovered his self-control, and asked the\r\nboys what it all meant. They told him all about it. He listened to them\r\nwith a serious face, which, however, was occasionally disturbed by a\r\ntendency to another outburst, as again and again the thought of the past\r\nscene forced itself back. Finally, he managed to get the whole story,\r\nand by that time his laughter passed, and was succeeded by a new\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nIt was one of intense delight at such discoveries. Now they appeared\r\nbefore him, not as old iron and old bone, but in their true character.\r\nHe was an enthusiastic antiquarian, and all connected with the Acadian\r\nFrench excited his passionate interest. He looked affectionately at the\r\nploughshare. He handled the colter tenderly. He examined one by one,\r\nwith minute inspection, the spikes and the bolt. He scanned narrowly and\r\nadmiringly the iron pot. He passed every link of the rusty chain through\r\nhis fingers. He lingered long and lovingly over the coins, closely\r\nexamining every one of them. He looked at the bone with an intense\r\ncuriosity, mingled with deep sympathy for the unfortunate race of which\r\nit was the reminder.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself into his admiration over these with the same\r\nabandonment of feeling that had characterized his laughing fit. It was\r\na proud and a delightful moment for the boys when they found that their\r\ndiscoveries were so highly prized. The doctor declared that there was\r\nnothing in the Museum to be compared with them, and finally sent for\r\nMessrs. Simmons and Long. These gentlemen soon appeared, and exhibited\r\nan interest in these Acadian relics which was fully equal to that of the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nBut the wonder was, to all of them, how in the world the boys had\r\nhappened to think of digging in that particular place. They questioned\r\nthem closely, though good humoredly, about this; and Bart, after vain\r\nefforts at eluding the questions, finally told the whole story.\r\n\r\nBart told that story in such a whimsical way, and with such an eye to\r\neffective representation, that in five minutes he had all his audience\r\nin another roar of laughter, worse than the first. He mimicked Captain\r\nCorbet with his mineral rod. He told about the lights and the magic\r\nceremonies. He took off Solomon capitally, and finally spoke of the\r\ndonkey’s bray, and its result, concealing nothing of their own terror.\r\nBart went on, interrupted all the time by the laughter of his hearers,\r\nand at last succeeded in bringing his story down to the moment in which\r\nhe was speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_The Doctor’s Proposal.--Blomidon.--The Expedition by Land.--The\r\nDrive by Morning Twilight.--The North Mountain.--Breakfasting amid the\r\nSplendors of Nature.--The illimitable Prospect.--The Doctor tells the\r\nStory of the French Acadians._\r\n\r\n\r\n“BOYS,” said the doctor, after Bart had ended his narrative, “it isn’t\r\noften that such nonsense as yours was turns out so well in the end. I’d\r\nrather have this old iron pot, with these old black sous, than even that\r\npot of gold which dazzled your imaginations so when you were digging.\r\nIf all mineral rods were to be so very lucky as Captain Corbet’s was, we\r\nmight go and test every old French cellar in the country. I can assure\r\nyou this is a gift of no common value. The rust marks and the mud which\r\nyou have made on my books and papers are rather welcome than otherwise.\r\nBart’s bone ought to receive a very careful examination. I think we\r\nought to dig up the whole cellar, and we may find more bones there.\r\n\r\n“But I’ve got a proposal to make, which, perhaps, you will think a\r\nreward for your discovery. To-morrow is Saturday. How would you like\r\nto go off with me on an excursion for the day,--you and the other\r\nboys,--the same party, in fact, that went with Mr. Long?”\r\n\r\n“An excursion!” cried the boys, with radiant faces.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the doctor. “I’ve been intending to make one for some time.\r\nI was disappointed in not going with you in the schooner. These relics\r\nhave revived an idea which I had last year, but was not able to put in\r\npractice. It is this: I have good reason to believe that somewhere on\r\nthe top of Blomidon there once stood a French fort, and that the ruins\r\nare very distinctly visible yet. I have a very clear idea in my mind of\r\nthe exact locality, and think I can find it without any trouble. I am\r\nvery anxious to go there, and perhaps we can find more French relics to\r\nadd to our little stock in the Museum.\r\n\r\n“Now, my plan is this: I will take my carriages and horses, and the\r\nwhole party can be accommodated. We will take provisions for the day. We\r\nmust start as early as four o’clock, so as to be at the mountain early.\r\nWe can breakfast over there. After we have found the French fort, I wish\r\nto have a few hours for a quiet examination of the cliffs. I know some\r\ngood places for minerals, and I think I can obtain a basket full without\r\nmuch trouble. I will see about the baskets, shovels, and hammers. We\r\nshall want a spade or two, and I think, under the circumstances, we can\r\nspend a very pleasant day. Now, what do you say to that?”\r\n\r\nThe answer of the delighted boys came in a perfect chorus of incoherent\r\nand unintelligible words, in which, however, could easily be perceived\r\nthe language of intense excitement and of joyous assent.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the doctor. “You let the other boys know, and remember\r\nyou must all be ready on the spot by four o’clock to-morrow morning--not\r\na minute later.”\r\n\r\nAfter this the boys retired in great spirits to let the others know the\r\ngood fortune that awaited them on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe following morning came, and all the boys were on the spot before the\r\nappointed time. The doctor had three double wagons ready, drawn by six\r\nhorses, and filled with provisions, and all the implements that might,\r\nby any possibility, be needed. It was quite dark as yet, but they\r\nstarted in high glee, and as they drove along it became lighter every\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThey all felt the importance of the occasion. No frolicking this time.\r\nNo dressing up like scarecrows. No running ashore on mud flats. No\r\ngetting lost in fogs. No feeding on clams. No starvation. Everything was\r\nnow to be perfectly regular, perfectly orthodox, and rather dignified.\r\nThey were going, in the twofold capacity of archaeologists and\r\ngeologists, to search after the ruins of an ancient and historic\r\nfortress, and then to find the mate of that amethyst which was taken\r\nfrom here to delight a king of France.\r\n\r\nAt first, as they drove on through the level country, all the fields\r\nand woods around lay wrapped in shadow; but as they went on the shadows\r\nlessened, and they began to see the first rays of dawn. Leaving the\r\nhigher country, they at length descended into the dike land, which they\r\ntraversed, and at length reached the bridge that crosses Cornwallis\r\nRiver. Then they went off over the wide vale of Cornwallis towards the\r\nNorth Mountain.\r\n\r\nOn and on. The vale of Cornwallis has five different indentations, up\r\nwhich the sea once flowed; but these are now reclaimed, and here the\r\ngreen and fertile meadows spread out where once was red mud or salt sea.\r\nOn the long ridges between these diked districts are the houses of the\r\nfarmers, and woods, and orchards, and groves, and gardens. On every\r\nside are the evidences of plenty and prosperity. Here and there small\r\nvillages appear, the centre of trade. The roads are numerous, running\r\nevery way, and are known by the name of streets. Nowhere can a country\r\nbe found which enjoys a greater abundance of all the richest gifts of\r\nnature, a larger measure of all that can charm the eye, or invigorate\r\nthe body, or confer wealth and prosperity. Nowhere in the world can\r\nactual working farmers be found whose tables are so loaded with varied\r\nand substantial dishes. The Cornwallis farmers have not yet learned to\r\nuse everything that they have for purposes of trade. They are satisfied\r\nwith making money on one or two leading products, but reserve their\r\nturkeys, and chickens, and cheese, and hams, and eggs, and apples, and\r\nplums, to weigh down their own dinner tables.\r\n\r\nOn they went through streets, as they were called,--which in some places\r\nwere so closely bordered with houses that they deserved the name,--past\r\nbeautiful villas hidden among trees, past rich orchards, past long\r\nhedgerows, past churches which pointed heavenward their tapering spires;\r\non they rode through busy little villages, over the broad dike lands,\r\nwhose rich, green robe extended far away on either side; along the edge\r\nof deep mud gulches, which were to be filled by the rising tide; over\r\nroads where there was not a stone to be seen, but only that soft, red\r\nsoil which makes such rich fields, but such wretched paths; and still,\r\nas they went on, it constantly grew brighter, until at last the red sun\r\nbounded up into the sky, and threw his glow over all the scene.\r\n\r\nAt length they approached the North Mountain. The place towards which\r\nthey went was six or seven miles this side of Cape Blomidon, and the\r\ncarriage road wound up it on its way to settlements on the shore of the\r\nBay of Fundy. Up this road they went, and soon they all reached the top\r\nof the hill.\r\n\r\nThey drove for a mile along the ridge of the North Mountain, and at\r\nlength came to a place where the roadside was bare of trees, and the\r\nhillside sloped very abruptly down towards the plain. It was a place\r\nwell known to all of them. It was a favorite resort for the whole\r\ncountry on occasions of picnics or driving parties. Everything here was\r\nfamiliar--the brook where they could get water, the big stone against\r\nwhich they could build their fire. Here they drew up their horses, and\r\nprepared to take their breakfast. The fire was soon burning; the kettle\r\nwas filled with water, and was soon boiling; the tea was made, and the\r\nample repast was spread out upon the grass. Here they sat, satisfying\r\ntheir hunger, rendered keen by over two hours’ driving in the fresh\r\nmorning air, chatting merrily, and looking forth from their lofty seat\r\nupon one of the most glorious views that can be conceived.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it was a glorious prospect. Beneath them lay the plains of\r\nCornwallis, which all stood revealed to their elevated position with\r\nthat peculiar effect known as “a bird’s eye view.” There the valleys\r\nspread away with their intervening ridges; there ran the long,\r\nstraight streets; there rose the villas embowered among trees, the neat\r\nfarm-houses, and the tapering spires of churches.\r\n\r\nThe vivid green of the dike land surrounded all this, streaked here and\r\nthere by the long lines of woodland that rose on the low ridges, dotted\r\nby groves and orchards, and intersected by the red-colored soil of the\r\nroads. Far away on the opposite side lay the slopes of Grand Pré, with\r\nthe gleaming white of the houses dotting the green fields, and there\r\nwere the outlines of familiar objects, conspicuous among which was\r\nthe Academy, which rose immediately opposite, though many miles away.\r\nBetween them the sea rolled its waters, extending far away towards the\r\nleft, where the shores were so low that in one place the sea and sky\r\nseemed to blend together; but in other places the shores stood out in\r\nbolder reliefs, and there arose precipitous cliffs, and abrupt bluffs,\r\nand lofty hills. These were on the extreme left, where the eye could\r\nembrace a prospect that extended for fifty miles, while on the right the\r\neye could wander for many a mile, far away along that valley which lies\r\nbetween the North Mountain and the South, and out of which there now\r\ncame the Cornwallis River, with many a winding to receive the flood tide\r\nof the Basin of Minas.\r\n\r\nIt was upon this scene that they gazed as they took their breakfast;\r\nand while the emotions of each were different, all felt the same general\r\nglow that was naturally produced by the exhilaration of such a prospect\r\nand such a position. Blomidon could not be seen, for that was hidden\r\nbehind a projection on the coast-line that ran down towards the cape,\r\nand thus the scene was deprived of that grand figure which from every\r\nother point is so attractive. Yet the elevation of their position here,\r\nand the peculiar way in which the plain lay spread out at their feet,\r\nand the vast extent of country which was embraced by the eye, served, in\r\nsome measure, to make amends for the absence of the majestic cliff.\r\n\r\nAnd there, beneath them, the waters spread afar, red and turbid near the\r\nshore, but farther out changing to deep blue; while towards the left,\r\nwhere Blomidon lay hid, guarding the strait, they could see a mass of\r\nfog, which had been thrust in from the outside bay, and stood there a\r\ngray opaque wall, towering high above the water. Even as they gazed,\r\nthere shot out from that gray mass of fog a little schooner, which had\r\nthus leaped in a moment from darkness into sunlight, and, like a bird\r\nescaping suddenly from some gloomy cage, seemed to spread her wings\r\njoyously, and move exultantly through the fresh, clear air.\r\n\r\n“What a glorious prospect!” exclaimed Dr. Porter, who had been silently\r\nenjoying the view for a long time. “Is it any wonder that the old\r\nAcadians loved this country of theirs so passionately, and made such\r\ndesperate struggles to get back after they had been driven out?”\r\n\r\n“Did they try to get back, sir?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“I should think they did; and many succeeded, though they could not live\r\nagain in Grand Pré. But what a bitter thing it was to be torn, as they\r\nwere torn, from such a home as this, and scattered at random over all\r\nthe coast of North America!”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t the government sorry for it afterwards?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“O, no; it was one of the cruelties of war. After all, it was not as bad\r\nas the sack of a city, or even the bombardment of one. All these things\r\nare alike abominable, and full of horror. The government considered\r\nthemselves well rid of people who were a trouble to them. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see why they couldn’t have let them alone.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a sad story,” said the doctor, shaking his head. “I’ll tell you\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nAt this the boys all gathered around him. Some of them knew that story\r\npretty well; but others did not, and even those who did were very glad\r\nof the chance of hearing it again.\r\n\r\n“You all know about the discovery of America by Columbus,” began the\r\ndoctor, “and the voyages of Cabot immediately after. The French soon\r\nrivalled the English, and Spanish, and Portuguese. Cartier and Champlain\r\nsailed over all these seas, and by all these coasts, devoting themselves\r\nchiefly to what is now British America. It is certainly a strange thing\r\nthat the part of America which was originally British should now have\r\npassed away from British rule, and the only British America now should\r\nbe that which was originally French.\r\n\r\n“Many years passed away, and no colonies were formed. At last, at nearly\r\nthe same time, the French and English both began. The French, however,\r\nwere first. They came over, and in 1606 founded Port Royal--now\r\nAnnapolis, you know. A year or two after, the English founded Jamestown,\r\nand the French Quebec. So, you see, our little Annapolis is the oldest\r\nplace on the continent of America founded by Europeans, with, perhaps,\r\nthe exception of St. Augustine, in Florida.\r\n\r\n“This beginning showed how things would go. The English took the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, from Massachusetts to the Carolinas, while the French\r\ntook those countries that are now British provinces. At first but little\r\nprogress was made in this country. Its history consists chiefly of the\r\nrivalry of two leading French families, who maintained trading stations,\r\nand struggled for the preeminence out here, and for support from the\r\nFrench government. Still the settlements grew, and not long after Port\r\nRoyal was founded, the French established other places also, and among\r\nthem Grand Pré settlement. They came here, cleared the forest, diked the\r\nmarshes, and soon became a prosperous and a happy community.\r\n\r\n“So things went on. Meanwhile, the French and English were engaged in\r\ncontinual war’s. Port Royal was captured some half a dozen times. But at\r\nlength one of these wars was concluded by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713,\r\nby which this province was ceded to the English.\r\n\r\n“At the time of the cession it was supposed that all the French\r\npopulation would retire. The English allowed them a year to sell their\r\nproperty and depart; with the permission to remain, however, if they\r\nwould take the oath of allegiance. But none were willing to take the\r\noath. As to going away, that soon proved to be a difficult matter. In\r\nthe first place, it was impossible for them to sell their farms, for\r\nthere were none to buy them. In the second place, it was impossible to\r\nget away, for there were no ships to take them. The French government\r\nwould not send ships, for they hoped in the course of time to get back\r\nthe country, and preferred that this French population should remain.\r\nThe English, on the other hand, wouldn’t send their ships, first,\r\nbecause they thought it was the business of the French government to do\r\nso; and secondly, because the state of affairs out here scarcely excited\r\nany attention whatever in the home government.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the English held the country, after a fashion. They didn’t\r\nestablish any towns, or send out any emigrants, but merely sent a\r\ngovernor to Annapolis, as they now called Port Royal, with a nominal\r\nregiment of soldiers. These soldiers were neglected most abominably.\r\nTheir numbers dwindled down to a small company; they were ragged, and\r\nwithout sufficient arms and ammunition. The fort went to ruin. One\r\ngovernor went to England, and lived there, drawing his pay, and letting\r\nthe soldiers and the fort get along the best way they could.\r\n\r\n“At length one of the governors made an effort to do something. The\r\nFrench, instead of quitting the country, had increased in numbers to an\r\nalarming extent. So an attempt was made to get them to sign an oath of\r\nallegiance to the King of England. This they refused to do, unless a\r\nproviso were inserted in the oath, ‘that they should not be called upon\r\nto bear arms.’ The governor, after some demur, acceded to this request,\r\nand wrote the proviso on the margin of the document, which was then\r\nsigned. After this the English government repudiated this as utterly\r\nunreasonable, and other governors made various efforts to get the\r\nFrench to sign an unconditional oath, but only with partial success. The\r\nmajority of them claimed that indulgence which had been granted by the\r\nproviso, and in accordance with this they determined to help neither\r\nparty, not even their own countrymen. They assumed the name of Neutrals,\r\nby which they were known to both parties.\r\n\r\n“The English could do nothing. There was only a handful of soldiers at\r\nAnnapolis, and though they were afterwards taken better care of, yet the\r\nsoldiers and the fort formed but a weak representation of the power of\r\nBritain. The French were increasing in numbers. Here in Grand Pré they\r\nwere most numerous and most prosperous. They were peaceable, and happy,\r\nand industrious, and contented. As a general thing, they maintained most\r\nfaithfully their position of neutrality. French agents came among them\r\nto rouse them to action, but met with no response. French missionary\r\npriests, acting as agents for the French governors of Quebec and\r\nLouisbourg, tried to stir up their patriotic ardor, but without much\r\nsuccess. An expedition came from Louisbourg against Annapolis, but the\r\nAca-dians did not join it. Only a few joined the invading army, and when\r\nthey made an attack on Annapolis, the little English garrison was able\r\nto beat them off. No fact can speak more plainly than this in favor\r\nof the utter peacefulness of their dispositions, and their fixed\r\ndetermination to keep out of all difficulties. That neutrality which\r\nthey professed they maintained as perfectly as it was possible for any\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n“So things went on until the year 1749, when the English government took\r\nthe affairs of the long-neglected Province of Nova Scotia into their\r\nconsideration, and determined to colonize it on a large scale. So they\r\nsent out a fleet with thousands of emigrants, and built the town of\r\nHalifax. This was intended to be a counterpoise to Quebec, and also an\r\nassertion of their power in the Province of Nova Scotia. Besides this\r\nplace, which they made the capital, instead of Annapolis, they formed\r\nother settlements.\r\n\r\n“But they soon found themselves cramped. The French, having been there\r\nfirst, had taken possession of all the most eligible lands. The places\r\nto which emigrants would most wish to go were already filled up.\r\nAnnapolis, and Grand Pré, and other places were occupied; and the\r\nEnglish who wished to settle had to go to places which were far\r\ninferior. Besides this, the English wanted every man in the country to\r\nbe an active assistant,--not a neutral. All these things combined to\r\nmake the question of the Acadians a very troublesome one. The very\r\nfaithfulness with which they had maintained their professions of\r\nneutrality made it all the more difficult; and for some years the\r\nEnglish settlers found themselves thus shut out from the best part\r\nof the province, and confined to those portions which could never be\r\ndeveloped to any extent.\r\n\r\n“You must remember that it was not the Province of Nova Scotia, but all\r\nthe British colonies in America, that participated in this question. All\r\nalong the Atlantic coast the provinces watched with eager interest the\r\nprogress of the English settlement here. Hundreds, came to Halifax from\r\nMassachusetts and New York. They all belonged to that great English\r\nparty which, on this side of the Atlantic, was carrying on a\r\nnever-ending war with the French. It was a question between the French\r\nand English races, which should rule. The English were far superior as\r\ncolonizers, the French as organizers. The English settlers increased and\r\nmultiplied; the French kept up formidable forts and armies, and enlisted\r\nvast numbers of Indians on their side. There were a million and a half\r\nof English, but not a hundred thousand French; yet the French kept\r\narmies on foot which the English could barely equal. Besides, the\r\nFrench had a grand scheme by which they hoped to crush the growth of the\r\nEnglish, and finally subdue them. They held all the valley of the St.\r\nLawrence, and the valley of the Mississippi. They had settlements on\r\nboth rivers, and their great scheme was to build a line of forts from\r\nthe Mississippi to the St. Lawrence, which should act as a wall to hem\r\nin the English, and keep them within that narrow line of territory which\r\nlies along the Atlantic shore. All this alarmed the colonies. They\r\nwere ready to fight against the French for this boundary line, and were\r\ndetermined from the very outset to recognize no barrier whatever against\r\ntheir progress westward. Nominal peace might be between France and\r\nEngland at home, but out here there was never peace. War went on all\r\nalong the line of forts, and the French, with their Indians, struggled\r\nwith the hardy English colonists. Between all the English colonies there\r\nwas one universal sympathy; and while Nova Scotia watched the progress\r\nof her more southern sisters with intense interest, they, on their part,\r\nwatched the progress of affairs in Nova Scotia with interest no less\r\nintense. All were alike struggling with one common enemy. Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, all were watching to see how Halifax\r\nwould deal with the Acadians, or with Louisbourg; while Nova Scotia was\r\nwaiting to see how they would deal with the Ohio forts.\r\n\r\n“You may imagine, then, what was the feeling here when the news came\r\nof the expedition of that thick-headed and pragmatical fool General\r\nBrad-dock; of his disastrous and abominable defeat, when his army was\r\nruined, and his own life thrown away, by a miserably inferior number of\r\nFrench and Indians. A panic spread everywhere, and that panic which ran\r\nthrough the other colonies was strong in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n“Soon after, an opportunity arose to deal with the Acadians. The\r\ngovernor was a strong-willed, determined, and energetic man. A powerful\r\nfleet and army had assembled at Halifax. It was resolved to deal\r\nsummarily with the Acadians.\r\n\r\n“But how? That was the question. It would not do to march an army\r\nagainst them and expel them from their homes. They would merely fly to\r\nthe woods, and when the army had left, they would come back. So it was\r\nresolved to expel them from their homes altogether.\r\n\r\n“But how? Again the question arose. If they merely expelled them, giving\r\nthem the liberty of flying anywhere, they would all go to Cape Breton,\r\nto swell the numbers of their foes. If they conveyed them away to any\r\nparticular place, they might be formidable from their numbers, and find\r\nmeans of coming back in a body. So it was determined to carry them off\r\nfrom Nova Scotia, and scatter them as widely as possible over all the\r\ncolonies along the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n“By way of a beginning, they resolved to give the Acadians one last\r\nchance to take the oath of allegiance, though they knew that the offer\r\nwas useless. So they sent for the leading men of the settlements, and\r\nbrought them to Halifax. There they were told that they must take the\r\noath, or submit to punishment. The Acadians refused, and pleaded their\r\nrights as neutrals. Their plea was rejected, and they were imprisoned.\r\n\r\n“After this the measures which were taken were swift and summary. Before\r\nthe Acadians could know what had happened, British troops appeared at\r\neach of the settlements. At Grand Pré they summoned all the inhabitants\r\nto a place of meeting. The Acadians came without suspicion. There they\r\nwere all arrested. Vessels were all ready to receive them, and they were\r\nput on board. Husbands were separated from their wives, fathers from\r\ntheir children, never to meet again. They were all packed on board of\r\nthe vessels. These vessels were nearly all small schooners, which had\r\nbeen chartered by the government for this business from some Boston\r\nmerchants. Last year, when I was at Halifax, I saw among the Nova Scotia\r\narchives the accounts of these merchants against the government of Nova\r\nScotia for the expenses of carrying off the Acadians. I took a copy of\r\none or two, which I will show you some day.\r\n\r\n“The Acadians were thus in a moment snatched from their pleasant homes\r\nin this beautiful country, and separated from one another, and packed in\r\nsmall schooners, and carried far away,--some to Massachusetts, some\r\nto New York, some to Philadelphia, some to Virginia, and some to the\r\nCarolinas. What the Acadians of Grand Pré suffered, all suffered. They\r\nwere carried away, and scattered all over the Atlantic coast. A few\r\nfound their way back. But most of them lived and died in exile; and\r\nthere were friends divided, and husbands and wives severed, and families\r\nscattered, never to meet again on earth, but to wear out their lives in\r\na foreign land, with the loss of all that was most dear. But what’s the\r\nuse of enlarging on this? If you want to know more about it, go and read\r\nLongfellow’s Evangeline.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor ceased. The boys were silent, and in that silence the\r\nthoughts of all wandered sadly over that past, when these shores and\r\nthese waters witnessed the mournful expulsion of the Acadians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Plunging into the Depths of the primeval Forest.--Over Rock, Bush,\r\nand Brier.--A toilsome March.--The Barrens.--Where are we?--General\r\nBewilderment of the Wanderers.--The Doctor has lost his Way.--Emerging\r\nsuddenly at the Edge of a giant Cliff with the Boom of the Surf\r\nbeneath._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT length the doctor rose, and the boys all followed him to the\r\ncarriages. Getting in, they drove a short distance; and here the doctor\r\ninformed them that he was going to leave the horses and carriages.\r\n“We’ll take to the woods now,” said he, “and you must prepare for a\r\ngood, long, steady tramp. Well want a few things, though, to take with\r\nus. Two spades will be enough, one hammer, and an empty basket. You\r\nmay divide these among yourselves. Each of you had better take some\r\nsandwiches out of that basket, and anything else you may think necessary\r\nto keep you up on your expedition.”\r\n\r\nThe boys went off, at this, to lay in a stock of provisions. As they\r\nexpected to be on the move all day, each one took enough to last him.\r\nThe spades, &c., they divided among themselves, with the understanding\r\nthat, when those who first carried them grew tired, they should be\r\nrelieved by the others. The horses and wagons were left in charge of the\r\npeople of the house, with whom the doctor had some acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminaries the doctor warned the boys that he intended to\r\nplunge boldly into the woods. Some friends of his had formerly gone over\r\nthe woods to the right, which extended towards Cape Blomidon, but had\r\nfound nothing. He had made up his mind that if the fort were anywhere,\r\nit would be found among the woods on the left, and here was the country\r\nwhich he intended to explore.\r\n\r\nThey then started, the doctor taking the lead, and soon turned into the\r\nwoods. They entered a rough pathway, which had been formed by ox teams\r\nin winter while hauling out lumber and cord wood. It was now about nine\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the pathway divided into several others, one of which\r\nthe doctor chose, and went on, but soon found that it wound away in\r\na direction that did not suit him. He walked on a little farther, and\r\nthen, coming to place where the woods were less dense, he turned aside,\r\nand, with all his followers at his back, plunged into the primeval\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAt first the walking was not difficult, the trees standing far apart,\r\nand the soil beneath being covered with moss and long ferns; but after\r\na time the woods grew denser, and it was only with considerable effort\r\nthat they were able to move along. Every step seemed to make it worse.\r\nLong, slender trees shot up, not large enough to prevent their progress,\r\nbut sufficient to form an impediment; and working their way among these\r\nproved very difficult, and very fatiguing. What was worse, the ground\r\nbegan to grow rougher at every step. Soon they emerged from the thick\r\nunderbrush, and came to where the trees were larger, and farther apart\r\nfrom one another. But here the ground was spongy; and in every direction\r\nlay fallen trunks of trees, some prostrated but lately, others lying\r\nwhere they had lain for years, in every stage of decay. These they had\r\nto clamber over, or crawl under; and so it was that, in order to make\r\nany progress, they were compelled to use their hands as well as their\r\nfeet. The soil beneath was hidden under a covering of moss; but it was\r\nswampy and spongy, and the soft earth was interlaced with long, fibrous\r\nroots, in which their feet caught at every other step. This moss\r\noverspread everything. It grew over the fallen trees; it enfolded in its\r\ngreen mantle the huge granite bowlders that from time to time upreared\r\nthemselves beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nAt length they came to a slight rise in the ground, where the soil was\r\ndryer. Here the doctor paused, and the boys all flung themselves down\r\non the ground, breathing heavily. They had walked for two hours now,\r\nwithout stopping, and began to feel exhausted. The doctor also showed\r\nsigns of exhaustion. He said nothing, however, but scanned very narrowly\r\nthe scene around him.\r\n\r\nHe found but little before his eyes that was in any way different from\r\nwhat he had been looking at for the last two hours. He could see a\r\nfew paces before him, but no farther. There the trees arose, and the\r\nprospect terminated in the dim aisles of the forest, with their shadowy\r\nvistas. All around--before, behind, and on either side--it was the same.\r\nThere was the dense forest, just such a forest as they had traversed--it\r\nspread all around them. The only place where a view could be had for any\r\ndistance was overhead.\r\n\r\nBut even here it was no better. For the boys, as they flung themselves\r\ndown, saw that during their journey a change had taken place overhead.\r\nThe blue sky was no longer to be seen. In its place there came close\r\ndown a dull, gray, indistinct haze, which descended even to where they\r\nlay, hiding the tree tops from view.\r\n\r\nIt was the fog.\r\n\r\nSuch a common circumstance elicited no surprise, of course. It was no\r\nmore than might have been expected. The wind had changed, and the fog of\r\nthe Bay of Fundy had rushed over Blomidon, and they, in those dim woods,\r\nwere now enveloped in its folds. Nor was it so much a matter of regret\r\nto them as it might have been under other circumstances. Here in the\r\nwoods it made but little difference in their situation. Even if the\r\nsun were shining brightly overhead, the ground beneath would be just as\r\nswampy, the fallen trees as troublesome, the underbrush as thick.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the doctors own private feelings, he kept them to himself,\r\nand surveyed the scene in silence. At length he made up his mind as to\r\nhis course, and once more started for his onward journey.\r\n\r\nThe journey was the same as before. Sometimes a great growth of\r\nunderbrush would impede their progress, and that underbrush would\r\nvary from the tall, slender stems of the young maples to the dense and\r\nprickly spines of the young spruces. At other times the trees would\r\nstand apart, the scene would expand, and they would be encircled by a\r\ndense array of forest columns, between which the view was lost in shadow\r\nand gloom. Sometimes they plunged into swamps, unawares; at other times\r\nthey tore their way through ferns and trailing plants; again they were\r\ncompelled to climb over fallen trees, or crawl under them. Once they\r\ncame to a place which was quite bare of trees, but overgrown with fire\r\nweed and blueberries. Such places as these were known to them by the\r\nname of “Barrens,” and on this occasion they made use of it to take\r\na long rest. The doctor again looked all around him thoughtfully, and\r\nappeared buried in profound reflection.\r\n\r\nIt was here that a thought flashed to the minds of all the boys.\r\n\r\nIt was this.\r\n\r\nThe doctor hadn’t the least idea where he was!\r\n\r\nThe moment that thought arose, every act of the doctor’s confirmed\r\nit. His silence was a very remarkable thing. Usually he was genial and\r\nlively; and such was his flow of spirits, that he could always throw an\r\nair of joyousness around an occasion like this. Usually he was full of\r\npleasant and encouraging words. He had, by nature, a rare aptitude for\r\nwinning the affection and confidence of boys by throwing himself into\r\ntheir feelings. With all his attainments, he had in him much of that\r\nfresh, brave, frank, joyous, hilarious temper which we call “boyish;”\r\n and his own free and frank nature, his generous enthusiasm, his disdain\r\nfor all that was base, his exultation in all that was noble and pure,\r\nall combined to win the reverential affection of “his boys,” as he\r\ncalled them.\r\n\r\nBut now he had been silent for hours. During all that weary march he had\r\nspoken no word of encouragement. His pleasant, cheery voice, which\r\nmight have lightened half their toil, had not been heard. His face was\r\nanxious, his gaze abstracted. What in the world could be the cause of\r\nthis? This was the question that came to all; and all felt that one\r\nthing, and one thing only, could in any way account for this.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had lost his way!\r\n\r\nSuch was the general conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done? None of them could direct him aright. All\r\nwere alike in the dark as to their possible position. The sky was not\r\nvisible. There were no landmarks by which to be guided. Even the sight\r\nof the sun would have been a guide; but the sun was now shut out from\r\ntheir view by a dense veil of ever-increasing fog.\r\n\r\nThe doctor remained for a long time lost in his own thoughts, and this\r\ntime of rest was precious to the overworn boys. They talked in low tones\r\nwith one another as to where they might be. None could throw any light\r\non this question. Every one had a different opinion. None could even\r\nsuggest any reliable way of finding out what they wished to know. But at\r\nany rate the time of rest was precious to them all; and when at length\r\nthe doctor called to them to start once more, they followed him with new\r\nvigor in their limbs.\r\n\r\nThe doctor now crossed the “Barrens,” and changed his direction somewhat\r\nto the right. They entered the woods again, and once more encountered\r\nthe old struggle against swamps, and ferns, and underbrush, and tangled\r\nroots, and fallen trees. The journey this time seemed harder than\r\nbefore. The boys began to feel their exhaustion more keenly. They\r\nexchanged words of despondency, and declared to one another that they\r\ncould not hold out much longer. Their progress was much slower than it\r\nhad formerly been, for the doctor himself began to feel the effects\r\nof such unusual and such excessive exertion. He led them forward,\r\ntherefore, quite slowly, and stopped to rest at times.\r\n\r\nWhat made it worse for the boys was the fact that all this time they had\r\nto carry the shovels and other things. There were four of these, viz.,\r\ntwo spades, one hammer, and one basket. These the boys carried by\r\nturns; but the trouble of carrying them under such circumstances was\r\nintolerable. Sometimes they proposed to one another to drop them;\r\nbut this proposal was not carried out. They still bore them on, and\r\nexchanged their burdens more rapidly as they grew more weary.\r\n\r\nAt last the woods grew thinner, the ground dryer, and the trees smaller.\r\nThe walking was much easier. The necessity of such very violent exertion\r\nwas taken off.\r\n\r\nThis ground formed a gentle declivity, where the woods in front, though\r\nmuch thinner than those behind, still shut out the view. Gradually these\r\nwoods grew less and less dense, until at last immediately in front they\r\ncould look through and see beyond the signs of some opening.\r\n\r\nAnd now the ground began to descend more steeply. Where they were going\r\nnone could tell. Some thought that they were approaching a clearing, for\r\nevery step made the opening in front more and more plain. Through the\r\ntrees there was nothing visible, indeed, but the gray, foggy atmosphere;\r\nyet this itself showed them that they were about to emerge from the\r\nwoods; where, or in what part of the country, they could not imagine.\r\nSome of them thought that they were approaching a settlement, and\r\nrejoiced in the prospect of getting upon a road, or finding a house\r\nwhere they might rest. Others thought that they were descending the\r\nslope of the mountain towards Cornwallis, and were hoping every moment\r\nto emerge forth from the woods into some green meadow or pleasant\r\npasture. Whatever hope they might have had, its effect on all of them\r\nwas the same. They forgot their fatigue; new strength came to their\r\nwearied limbs. The doctor advanced faster, and the boys, in their\r\neagerness, even hurried ahead of him. Bruce and Bart were first among\r\nthe hurrying throng.\r\n\r\nAnd now the ground descended still more steeply, and in front the\r\ngray mist spread out more widely; but one or two trees yet intervened.\r\nForward rushed Bart and Bruce. After them hurried all the others.\r\n\r\nBut what was this?\r\n\r\nSuddenly they all stopped, and sprang back a pace or two.\r\n\r\nFor they had reached almost the outside edge of the forest, but only to\r\nfind that the gray mist before them was floating free in the sky, and\r\nthat the skirt of the forest was the edge of a tremendous precipice,\r\nwhich went sheer down below them, to a place where the wild sea waves,\r\nhidden from them by the mist, sent up a long, low, distant, booming\r\nsound, as they broke in thunder on the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_Woods, Precipices, Mists, and Ocean Waves.--The Party divided, and each\r\nHalf departs to seek its separate Fortune.--Pat shows how to go in\r\na straight Line.--Pat and the Porcupine.--In Chase after\r\nPat.--Disappearance of Pat.--A lost Pat.--Wanderings in Search of the\r\nLost._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY stood for a while confounded.\r\n\r\nBefore them nothing could be seen but the impenetrable fog. The water\r\nbeneath was not visible, but the surf sent up its boom, and they knew\r\nthat they were somewhere on the shore of the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nBut where?\r\n\r\n“This is certainly a most extraordinary thing!” cried the doctor, at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nThe others said nothing, but by their silence assented to the truth of\r\nthis undeniable statement.\r\n\r\n“One thing is evident.” said the doctor again, “and that is, that this\r\nis not the old French fort. In fact, I begin to doubt whether there is\r\nany old French fort here at all. They surely would never have been mad\r\nenough to build any kind of a fort in these abominable woods.”\r\n\r\nTo this, again, the boys made no reply. The assertion seemed so\r\nself-evident that it appeared like the utterance of actual fact.\r\n\r\n“It is a conviction,” resumed the doctor, “that has been growing\r\nstronger and stronger ever since we left the ‘Barrens,’ and I now accept\r\nit without reserve. But at the same time, boys, I confess that I haven’t\r\nthe smallest idea where we are.”\r\n\r\n“We must be somewhere on the coast between Scott’s Bay and Hall’s\r\nHarbor,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly true,” said the doctor; “but where on that coast? As some\r\nten or fifteen miles lie between those two places, we have an almost\r\nunlimited latitude for conjecture.”\r\n\r\nNothing was said for some time. All looked along the coast line in both\r\ndirections, to see if anything were visible. Nothing, however, could be\r\nseen. The dense fog concealed everything from view.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the doctor, “we shall have to do something; that’s evident.\r\nNow, you’re all very tired, and so am I. Let us sit here and rest, and\r\ndebate which way we had better turn.”\r\n\r\nThey all sat down on the slope, and, looking at their watches, they\r\nfound that it was half past two o’clock.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t much time to lose; that’s plain,” said the doctor, as he\r\nlooked at his watch. “Let us try, first of all, to find out where we\r\nare. In the first place, I think, all things considered, that we came\r\nin a pretty straight line. I tried to guide myself by the tree-tops as I\r\nwent, and I think our course was as straight as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe boys all thought so, too.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the doctor, “I’m quite positive about that. It was in my\r\nmind all the time to keep a perfectly straight course. If it hadn’t\r\nbeen for that, our way would have been easier. But I had decided on the\r\nposition of the old French fort, and had marked it on my map. So, on\r\nstarting, I took my bearings, and kept on by the trees, keeping as\r\nstraight a course as possible. You observed how attentive I was to\r\nthat. That was the reason why I had so few words of encouragement for\r\nmy patient young friends who were toiling after me, and for whom I felt\r\nexceedingly sorry all the time.”\r\n\r\n“O, doctor,” said Bart, “we’re all right,--we only hope that you will\r\nstand it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us keep up our spirits,” said the doctor, cheerily, “and\r\nwe’ll come out all right yet. So, you see, we may consider that our\r\ncourse has been a fair one. And now I will make a rough map of our\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the doctor took his memorandum-book and drew his “rough\r\nmap.” He marked a rough outline for the coast between Scott’s Bay and\r\nHall’s Harbor. Then he drew the roads which ran from each of these\r\nplaces across the North Mountain to Cornwallis; and finally he traced\r\na straight line from the place where they had started, in the direction\r\nwhich he supposed that they had gone. The result was, that he made their\r\npresent position close by Hall’s Harbor. After finishing this, he handed\r\nit to the boys, who inspected it very closely.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the doctor, “what do you think of it?”\r\n\r\nThey were silent for some time. At length Bruce spoke.\r\n\r\n“The only thing against it, sir,” said he, “is, that our course may not\r\nhave been so perfectly straight.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” said the doctor, “I took particular care, and always kept\r\nseveral trees in line before me, so as to go straight.”\r\n\r\n“Still, sir,” said Bruce, “travelling in the woods is a very peculiar\r\nthing. I’ve done it often. I’ve lived for weeks in the woods, camping\r\nout; and it’s always been my experience that a man can’t go straight,\r\nunless he has a compass, or at least some general landmarks. An Indian\r\nmight, perhaps; but I’m sure I couldn’t.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed quite impressed by this.\r\n\r\n“Well, Bruce,” said he, “I know you have had far more experience in the\r\nwoods than I can pretend to, and I should like very much to get your\r\nopinion without reserve.”\r\n\r\n“You see, sir,” said Bruce, “everybody has a tendency, in the woods, to\r\nlean to the right. It’s the same, I’ve heard, on the western prairies.\r\nI don’t pretend to know the cause of it. I only know it’s so. This makes\r\none go in a kind of curved line, so that if one wanders long enough\r\nhe’ll perform a sort of circle. I know once, in Cape Breton, I actually\r\ncame back to the place I started from, and all the time I thought I\r\nwas miles away. I took great pains, too, to walk straight; and it was\r\na better country than this. Now we’ve been working our way through all\r\nkinds of places. We’ve been in thick underbrush, where, for my part, I\r\ndon’t see how it was possible to keep a straight course. We’ve had to go\r\nround rocks and fallen trees. After breaking a straight course by making\r\nsuch a circuit, however small, it seems to me almost impossible to take\r\nit up again. A slight mistake at the outset makes a great difference by\r\nthe time you get to the journey’s end.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the doctor, “where do you think we may be? Point out on the\r\nmap the place.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t do that,” said Bruce, “of course. I can only say that I think\r\nwe’ve been, as usual, swerving to the right; and if so, we are now\r\nreally much nearer to Scott’s Bay than we are to Hall’s Harbor.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor now sat thinking for some time.\r\n\r\n“There’s a great deal in what you say, Bruce,” said he, at length, “and\r\nI’m very glad you’ve given your opinion. At the same time I feel quite\r\nconfident that, if I have swerved to the right, it cannot have been\r\nto any great extent. The care which I took was so extreme, that my\r\ncalculations cannot be much out of the way. I dare say I may have lost\r\nmy course a little while going through the thick underbrush, but I’m\r\nconvinced that I found it again pretty correctly. Now I will mark out a\r\nnew track on the map, and make allowance for any deviation from a true\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the doctor traced a new line, which curved slightly to the\r\nright, and made their present position somewhat farther away from Hall’s\r\nHarbor than the former conjecture had made it. Still this new estimate\r\nmade them much nearer to Hall’s Harbor than to Scott’s Bay.\r\n\r\nHe showed this to Bruce, and asked him what he thought of it.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Bruce, “I will only say that if I had headed the\r\nparty, with all my care, I should be very much farther to the right than\r\nyou make it.”\r\n\r\n“So you think that we are now nearer to Scott’s Bay than to Hall’s\r\nHarbor?”\r\n\r\n“Very much nearer, sir,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said no more, but sat for a long time silently regarding his\r\nmap.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, at last, “it seems to me to be a fair question. You,\r\nBruce, have had very much experience in the woods; but then I rely on my\r\nown correctness. On the whole, I think it would be better for us now to\r\ndivide ourselves into two parties. One party could go in the direction\r\nof Hall’s Harbor, the other towards Scott’s Bay. As you are an old hand\r\nin the woods, Bruce, I consider you quite fit to head one party, and try\r\nScott’s Bay. For my part, I will take another party, and make for Hall’s\r\nHarbor. What do you say to that?”\r\n\r\n“O, no, sir,” said Bruce; “we won’t leave you. We’ll stay with you, and\r\nfollow you wherever you go.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed.\r\n\r\n“O, nonsense!” said he. “If we were wandering in the forests of the\r\nAmazon valley, we might then make it a matter of duty to stand by\r\none another; but these woods are only a small affair. By going in any\r\ndirection, we must emerge from them before very long. Even if we were\r\novertaken by the darkness, it would be no great hardship to pass the\r\nnight here. We could make comfortable beds out of spruce boughs\r\nand fern. To tell the truth, roughing it in the bush has rather an\r\nattraction for me than otherwise; and I know your weakness, boys, in\r\nthat respect. Besides, in two hours, at the very farthest, we’re sure to\r\ncome out somewhere. If I thought that there was any danger, I would not\r\nthink of separating you, but would guard you as carefully as possible.\r\nThe most that can happen is some little inconvenience. So, Bruce, you\r\nmay consider yourself the commander of the Scott’s Bay party. Who will\r\nbe your followers?”\r\n\r\n“I,” said Bart, whose hesitation had been driven away by the doctor’s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“I,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Tom. “And I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Bedad, thin, an it’s mesilf that’ll jine that same,” said Pat, who\r\npreferred the comparative freedom that he would enjoy under Bruce to the\r\nrestraint which he felt with the doctor. For the doctor, who, with the\r\nother boys, was a great favorite, and had won all their hearts by that\r\nboyish enthusiasm which age could never extinguish in him, and by his\r\nevident fellow-feeling and sympathy with them in all their joys and\r\nsorrows, was not so well known to Pat, and, in spite of his kindness\r\nto the poor Irish boy, still remained an object of grateful affection\r\ncertainly, but yet one of extreme awe. So Pat elected to go with Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe other boys preferred taking their chance with the doctor. These were\r\nJiggins, Bogud, Sammy, Johnny, and Billymack. Thus the party was about\r\nequally divided,--five going under the command of Bruce, and five under\r\nthe command of the doctor. By the time these arrangements were completed\r\nit was three o’clock. They all felt refreshed by their rest, and\r\ninspirited also by the prospect of getting onward out of the woods into\r\nsome road, or some settlement.\r\n\r\n“If I reach Hall’s Harbor,” said the doctor, “I will get horses, and\r\ndrive at once to where we left our wagons. If you get to the Scott’s Bay\r\nroad, go back to that place and wait for me.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the doctor and his party set off in one direction,\r\nwhile Bruce started away with his followers in another. As the trees\r\nwere farther apart near the edge of the cliff, he walked along here for\r\nsome time; but at last finding that the line was irregular, and coming\r\nto a place where it ran out into a kind of promontory, he kept on,\r\nseeking only to find the easiest place for walking. For a long time he\r\ntried to keep in a line with what he supposed to be the direction of the\r\ncoast; but at length he found himself away from it altogether. He then\r\nturned, determined to regain it, but found the way so difficult that he\r\ngave it up.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, boys,” said he, “our only chance was to keep stolidly\r\nalong the edge of the cliff, and follow all its windings. We’ve lost it\r\nnow. There are two things for us to do--either to get back to the cliff\r\nagain at all hazards, or to keep on through the woods as we are going\r\nnow. One is the safer way, but the other is easier.”\r\n\r\n“O, bother the cliff,” said Bart; “we’re doing very well. I don’t care,\r\nfor my part, whether we’re lost or not. I’d just as soon camp out.\r\nThe only trouble is, we haven’t anything to eat. We’ve eaten all our\r\nsandwiches. And then these miserable spades. I don’t see why they\r\ncouldn’t have taken them. But no--Jiggins and Bogud insisted on taking\r\nthe hammer and the basket, and they call that a fair division!”\r\n\r\n“I’m of Bart’s opinion,” said Arthur. “I say, let’s go where it is\r\neasiest, and trust to luck. And let’s all take care of our right legs,\r\nand not let them drag us into a circle.”\r\n\r\n“No, that won’t do,” said Bruce; “if you try to guard against turning to\r\nthe right, you’ll be sure to turn too much to the left. It’s impossible\r\nto go straight unless you’re an Indian. Best to walk as straight as\r\nyou can, and occasionally change your course so as to correct any\r\ndeviation.”\r\n\r\n“Why not walk zigzag?” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Or backwards?” said Tom. “I’ll tell you,” said Pat, “what we’d ort till\r\ndo. Let’s howld a sthraight powl before ourselves, an follow it. That’ll\r\nbe sure till take us sthraight.”\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter greeted this proposal.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Pat; get your pole and try it,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“‘Deed an I jist will,” said Pat; and seeing a young, slender maple near\r\nby, he cut it down with his knife, lopped off the young twigs, and\r\nthus formed a long, slender, straight pole. Taking this in his hand, he\r\ngravely put himself at the head of the party. Then he held out the pole.\r\n“There,” said he; “isn’t this powl sthraight?”\r\n\r\n“Of course it is,” said they.\r\n\r\n“Then sure, an if we go by it, we must go sthraight, too,” said Pat. And\r\nsaying this, he started off, holding the pole before him.\r\n\r\nThe boys followed in great glee, almost bursting with laughter,\r\nwhile Pat led them on with his pole, with an expression of ineffable\r\nsatisfaction, holding the pole straight before him.\r\n\r\nSo they went on, and Bruce, out of pure enjoyment of the thing, let Pat\r\nlead wherever he wished.\r\n\r\nAt last Pat gave a wild yell, leaped forward, and slashed violently with\r\nhis pole at something.\r\n\r\nThe hoys crowded up.\r\n\r\nThe something at which Pat had struck had got under some fern leaves,\r\nand was not visible. But Pat slashed away bravely in all directions.\r\nSuddenly there came running out a queer little animal, all covered with\r\nsharp spines. It did not run very fast, and Bart, who carried a spade,\r\ncould easily have killed it. But he did not. He stood, still, and let it\r\nrun close by him. Pat had lost sight of it for a moment, and was looking\r\nin all directions for it, when suddenly he caught sight of it. With a\r\nwild yell he rushed after it, swinging his pole and slashing it madly\r\nagainst the ground. The little animal dodged under some blueberry\r\nbushes; and while Pat was slashing at these, it escaped and ran into a\r\nhollow tree which lay on the ground. Into this Pat poked his pole; but\r\nas he poked it in at one end, the little animal ran out from the other,\r\nand hurried away as fast as his little legs would carry him.\r\n\r\nAgain Pat caught sight of him, and gave chase.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the other boys had not interfered. They left it all to Pat.\r\nThey also felt a sort of sympathy with the poor little creature, and\r\ngave it all their best wishes in its efforts to escape. Phil, as well as\r\nBart, might have despatched it with the spade that he happened just then\r\nto be carrying; but he would not: so the little thing ran off, and Pat\r\nfollowed after it, turning and winding in all directions. The boys then\r\nwent off after Pat, so as to keep him in sight; but before long they\r\nlost him altogether. They went forward to the last place where they had\r\nseen him, and began to shout for him.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, however.\r\n\r\nThey shouted again and again, and waited a long time for some response.\r\nThey began to be anxious about him. Where had he gone? He was chasing\r\nthat little animal, and in the excitement of the chase had forgotten\r\neverything. It was getting late, and there was no time now for chasing\r\nanything. They ought to be moving on, and trying to get to Scott’s Bay.\r\nBut they could not do so till they had found Pat.\r\n\r\nThey wandered along, calling in every possible kind of way, and waiting,\r\nafter every call, to see if there would be any response. But no response\r\ncame. They kept on in the way in which they supposed Pat had gone, and\r\nshouted, and screamed, and halloed, and yelled, and whistled, and made\r\nevery noise that could be made. But their utmost efforts proved of no\r\navail; and all their shouts excited no response, except the echoes that\r\nreverberated through the long, dim forest aisles.\r\n\r\nAt length they gave up.\r\n\r\n“Well, what are we to do now?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Pat’s off--that’s certain,” said Bart; “and how we can find him again\r\nis more than I can tell.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any danger, of course. He’ll work his way along; but still\r\nhe belongs to our party, and I don’t like the idea of leaving him.”\r\n\r\n“We’d better keep on quietly, as we were going,” said Arthur. “There’s\r\nno use for us to stand still. This seems to be the direction in which he\r\nwas going.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tom; “let’s go on. We haven’t any time to lose. It’s six\r\no’clock now.”\r\n\r\nThey went on.\r\n\r\nThey hadn’t the faintest idea now where they were. Whatever general\r\nnotion of their course they had kept up, while first following Pat, had\r\nnow been altogether lost. His chase after the little animal had been a\r\nvery eccentric one, and they had faced in several different directions\r\nwhile pursuing him. The monotonous woods gave no sign by which they\r\nmight learn their course. They could not find their way now even to the\r\nplace where Pat had been seized with his strange frenzy. The fact is,\r\nthey were utterly and hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Arthur, “that we’re going to Hall’s Harbor.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Phil; “we’re steering straight for Cornwallis.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it,” said Tom. “We’re going to Scott’s Bay.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion,” said Bart, “that we’re on our way to the cliff; and\r\nas its getting dark, we’d better be careful. Bruce, if you get to the\r\ncliff first, and fall over in the dark, just let us know before you\r\ngo down. I wouldn’t care so much in fine, bright weather, but I have a\r\nprejudice against tumbling over cliffs on a foggy night.”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t trouble yourself,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“We’ll never come near a cliff, or anything else. I know all about it.\r\nWe’re wandering in a circle. We’ll camp in the woods to-night, and\r\nto-morrow night, after wandering all day, we’ll get back to the same place.\r\nI move, therefore, that we stop now in this place, and build a good,\r\nsolid camp, that will serve for a shelter every night after our circular\r\nwanderings.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “we won’t begin just yet. I want to get to the\r\ncliff.”\r\n\r\n“I want to get to Scott’s Bay,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“I’m determined,” said Phil, “to get to Cornwallis.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Arthur. “Every one of us will sleep to-night in Hall’s\r\nHarbor. Come along, boys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_All lost--The gathering Gloom of Fog and of Night--Sudden\r\nDiscovery.--The lost One found.--A Turkey with four Legs.--A cheerful\r\nDiscussion.--Five Hours of Wandering.--When will it end?--Once more upon\r\nthe Tramp._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY went on.\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening were now coming down rapidly, and these were all\r\nintensified by the dense fog that hung around them. The woods grew more\r\nand more obscure, and the gloom that prevailed here was added to that of\r\nthe twilight and the fog. It was evident that they could not go on much\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it was not so difficult now as it had been previously. The\r\ntrees stood farther apart than usual. There was but little underbrush.\r\nThe ground was covered with moss, but it was quite dry. This was\r\nencouraging, for if they tried to pass the night in the woods, they\r\ncould not find a better place than the one which they were traversing.\r\nThey would probably have given up, and decided upon making preparations\r\nfor the night, had it not been for their desire to find Pat. If he had\r\nbeen with them, their journey for that night would have ended. But they\r\ndid not like to think of him alone, severed from them, and wandering\r\nin the woods. So they kept on their way; and still, as they went along,\r\nthey shouted occasionally, with some vague hope that their cry might\r\ncome to the ears of the wanderer.\r\n\r\nIt grew darker and darker.\r\n\r\nAt last they began to think of halting for the night. Pat was given\r\nup. They comforted themselves with the thought that he was hardy, and\r\nfearless, and self-reliant; that the nights were mild; and that spruce\r\nboughs abounded, together with ferns and moss, on which one might\r\nsleep peacefully and pleasantly. So, as it grew darker, they talked of\r\nstopping, and making their preparations for the night before it grew too\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as they were talking over these things, they saw before them\r\nthrough the trees, yet not more than a dozen paces distant, a very\r\nfamiliar form. It was a “snake fence,”--that is to say, a fence formed\r\nof poles, built in such a way that it runs in a zigzag direction. At\r\nonce the thought flashed upon them that they were near some farmhouse,\r\nperhaps some settlement; and then arose the hope of a better night’s\r\nrest than could be afforded by the woods with their damp and foggy\r\natmosphere. With a cry of joy they rushed forward. They reached it.\r\nThey looked over. In a moment the cry of joy was succeeded by one of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nIt was a road which lay before them.\r\n\r\nYes, a road, wide and well travelled,--not a private path to some small\r\ncottage, not an ox-path through dense woods, but a regular road fit for\r\ncarriages, and evidently leading to some settlement.\r\n\r\nBut what settlement?\r\n\r\nIn a moment they had clambered over the fence, and stood in the road\r\nwith one common determination in all of them not to leave it again for\r\nany woods whatsoever.\r\n\r\nYet what road was this? and where did it go?\r\n\r\nThis was the question.\r\n\r\nAnd this question it was not possible to answer.\r\n\r\nHad they continued on uninterruptedly, Bruce would have been convinced\r\nthat it was the Scott’s Bay road. But their digression after Pat had led\r\nthem such a journey, that he was not by any means sure; nor were any of\r\nthe others. All felt that they had been wandering blindly, that after\r\nleaving the cliff they had no certainty as to their destination. This\r\nuncertainty had been increased by Pat’s leadership with the pole, and\r\nhad been turned into utter and hopeless perplexity by their last pursuit\r\nof him. They had been wandering now, since they parted with Dr.\r\nPorter, for more than four hours. That gave time enough for them to get\r\nanywhere. It might be the road to Hall’s Harbor in which they now found\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn this state of uncertainty they remained for some time.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bruce, at last, “it’s impossible to tell where we\r\nare; but, in my opinion, we’d better take it for granted that this is\r\nthe Scott’s Bay road. It’s more likely, after all, to be that than the\r\nHall’s Harbor road. If it is, we have to find our way back to where the\r\nwagons are, according to the doctor’s directions, and wait there for\r\nhim. Now, if this is the Scott’s Bay road, we must turn to the right,\r\nin order to go back, for on the left it goes to Scott’s Bay. So, I say,\r\nlet’s turn up the road to the right, and walk back to the wagons.”\r\n\r\nBruce’s opinion was accepted by the others, and his decision at once\r\nadopted. They all turned up the road to the right, and walked onward,\r\nnot knowing how far they would have to walk, yet feeling greatly\r\ninspirited by the mere fact that they were out of the woods.\r\n\r\nAs they went on, it grew darker and darker at every step. The sun had\r\ngone down, the shadows of night were descending, and these shadows\r\nwere all deepened by the universal fog which covered all things. The\r\ndeepening gloom made their own escape from the woods appear all the more\r\nfortunate. True, they might have built a fire there, to cheer themselves\r\nby its light, and spread soft beds of moss and fern around it, and thus,\r\neven amid the forest, they could have risen superior to their dismal\r\nsurroundings; but still there was a very great relief, which was felt by\r\nall, at their gaining a road which might lead them to some human abode.\r\nBesides, they were hungry. They had eaten all their sandwiches, and were\r\neager for something to assuage their ravenous appetites.\r\n\r\nOne thing there was, however, which greatly marred their joy, and that\r\nwas the thought of poor Pat. Perhaps he still was wandering in the\r\nwoods, having given up his chase, calling for them, and thinking that\r\nthey had deserted him. The thought of poor Pat’s loneliness was a sad\r\none to all of them, and they could only find consolation in their belief\r\nin his perfect ability to take care of himself. At books he might not\r\nbe very brilliant, but in all the practical matters of life Pat was\r\ncertainly in every way worthy of being left entirely to himself. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, Pat was able to shine with uncommon brilliancy. In\r\nall probability, he would fare better if left to his own devices,\r\nthan he would if he were a member of a crowd of school-boys. With such\r\nthoughts as these they comforted themselves, and thus tried to overcome\r\ntheir anxiety about Pat.\r\n\r\nThey had walked about half a mile after leaving the woods, when they saw\r\na figure approaching them. It was not far away when they first noticed\r\nthat figure, and it appeared strangely familiar.\r\n\r\nThey came nearer and nearer. The familiar outlines of the approaching\r\nfigure grew more and more distinct. At last the figure came close up to\r\nthem, and then suspicions became a delightful certainty.\r\n\r\nYes! It was no other than Pat himself!\r\n\r\nA wild uproar of cheers and voluble questionings greeted the returning\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\n“When did you get out of the woods?” they asked.\r\n\r\n“Whin, is it? Sure it wor ony five minutes ago.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Where, is it? Sure I’m goin back till the ‘Cad’my.”\r\n\r\n“The Academy? Pooh! you’re going straight away from it. Come along with\r\nus. Didn’t you hear us calling you?”\r\n\r\n“Callin me? Niver a call did I hear.”\r\n\r\n“Why, we followed you, and yelled, and shouted, and halloed, and hooted,\r\nand screamed, and bawled, and roared, and squalled, and whistled, and\r\ncrowed, and croaked, and made every noise that we could make. We gave up\r\neverything to find you. It was only by chance that we found the road. We\r\nhave just been talking about you. We were thinking about going into\r\nthe woods again a little way, and shouting. But where’s your pole, and\r\nwhat’s become of the animal that you were chasing?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s the mischief itsilf intirely. Niver did I see such a\r\nbaste. I chased it, an chased it, an it dodged, an I thought I sthruck\r\nit a hundhred times; but the little baste got off afther all, so it\r\ndid.”\r\n\r\n“So you didn’t catch it.”\r\n\r\n“Catch it? Niver a catch. It tuk me tip into a place that I couldn’t get\r\nout of fur half an hour. I lost me pole, an gave up. I couldn’t find a\r\nsign of it, an I wandhered about, whin all av a suddint, I found mesilf\r\nby the road. An be the powers! it wor mesilf that wor glad till find\r\nthat same. The dirty little baste that wudn’t let itsilf be caught, like\r\na Christian!”\r\n\r\n“What dirty little baste?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the wild turkey.”\r\n\r\n“Wild turkey! Ha, ha, ha!”\r\n\r\n“Wild duck, thin.”\r\n\r\n“Wild duck!” cried the boys; and another laugh followed.\r\n\r\n“Well, thin, it wor a wild goose, ony it had fower legs, so it\r\nhad--whativer it wor.”\r\n\r\nAt this very remarkable description the boys’ laughter burst forth\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pat, “what wor it, thin?--wor it a bayver?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart, “nor a moose, either.”\r\n\r\n“What wor it, thin?” cried Pat. “Niver did I behowld anythin like it. It\r\nhad fower legs, so it had; an it had long spikes all over its back. Was\r\nit any kind of a rabbit, thin?”\r\n\r\n“It was a porcupine,” said Arthur. “Haven’t you ever seen any of them?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Bart. “Pat, look here. I’ll tell you really what it was.\r\nIt was the real, identical, original, bona fide ghost, that howls and\r\nknocks in the Academy garret. _You_ ought to have known it at once. I\r\ndid, the moment I saw it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, blatheration take ye, wid yer ghosts, an yer howls,” said Pat,\r\npeevishly. “An what wor that ye said?” he asked, turning to Arthur.\r\n“What wor the name av the little baste that ye mintioned jest now,\r\nthin?”\r\n\r\n“A porcupine,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Porkypine!” said Pat. “Porky pine! Well, it wor a strange baste\r\nintirely. I thried hard to get him. It ud have been a swate baste fur\r\nthe Musayum, so it wud. But I cudn’t get a howld av him, bad luck to\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“It’s lucky for you, Pat,” said Bart, “that you didn’t get hold of him.\r\nHe’s got spikes enough about his back to stick you through and through,\r\nif you put your hand on him. You’ve got off very easily, Pat. You ought\r\nto say good luck to him.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s mesilf that niver, niver saw the aqual av that baste, so\r\nI didn’t. I hit him mesilf wid me powl a dozen cracks--yes, a hundhred;\r\nbut niver a bit did he budge for all that same. He didn’t let out ayven\r\na squake, so he didn’t. An me a chasin av him over the wuds! But I\r\ncudn’t get nair him.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, Pat, it’s all right,” said Bruce. “You ought to be glad you\r\ndidn’t get near him. You’d have been laid up for a couple of months if\r\nyou had. If you don’t understand porcupines, you’d better steer clear of\r\nthem. They’re not very pleasant beasts to handle. I know that. But come,\r\nboys. It’s getting darker and darker. We mustn’t stand dawdling here all\r\nnight. Hurry up, and come along.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bruce strode forward, and all the boys followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_Sudden and unaccountable Reunion of the two wandering Bands.--A\r\ntremendous Circle described by Somebody.--Where are we going?\r\nScott’s Bay, or Hall’s Harbor.--Descent into the Plain.--Twinkling\r\nLights.--Sudden Sound of Sea Surf breaking in the Middle of a Prairie._\r\n\r\n\r\nAND now every moment it grew darker and darker. It was about eight\r\no’clock. The sun had gone down, the shadows of night were gathering, and\r\nthe fog seemed thicker than ever. As they walked on they could see but a\r\nfew paces before them.\r\n\r\nThey supposed themselves to be going in the direction of the house where\r\nthe wagons were left; but, after all, they were not quite sure of the\r\nway. It might be some other road altogether. They had been over the\r\nScott’s Bay road once or twice before, but it would not have been\r\nfamiliar even by daylight, while in such gloom as this, no road, however\r\nfamiliar, could be recognized. As they went they peered anxiously\r\nthrough the gloom, in hopes of seeing cultivated fields, or houses. But\r\nnothing of the kind appeared to their anxious eyes. They also looked\r\nforward with straining eyes, and listened with the closest attention,\r\nin hopes of meeting with some people who might make them acquainted\r\nwith their actual position. But nothing could be either seen or heard in\r\nfront, and so they had nothing else to do than to walk on as quickly as\r\ntheir wearied limbs would allow.\r\n\r\nAt length they heard the sound of voices ahead, and footsteps, which\r\nseemed to approach them. They stood and waited. Soon a number of figures\r\nappeared, rendered gigantic by the mist and darkness. The boys hurried\r\ntowards them, and Bruce at once addressed the foremost figure.\r\n\r\nThe foremost figure at the same instant addressed Bruce.\r\n\r\nAnd both asked exactly the same question, or rather part of what would\r\nevidently have been the same question if it had been finished.\r\n\r\nIt was,--\r\n\r\n_Bruce_. “Will you be kind enough to tell me--”\r\n\r\n_Foremost Figure._ “Will you have the goodness to tell me--”\r\n\r\nHere the questions broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\nAnd turned to,--\r\n\r\n_Bruce._ “Hallo!”\r\n\r\n_Foremost Figure._ “Why! What’s this!”\r\n\r\n_Bruce._ “Dr. Porter!!!”\r\n\r\n_Foremost Figure._ “Bruce Rawdon!!!”\r\n\r\nFor a few moments both parties were overwhelmed with utter bewilderment\r\nand a total prostration of all their faculties. This amazing and\r\nincomprehensible reunion of those who had parted five hours ago in the\r\nwild woods, by the lofty precipice and the thundering surf, going in\r\nexactly opposite directions, yet coming together in darkness and fog,\r\nwas a thing which might well reduce them to complete stupefaction.\r\n\r\nThen there arose a general uproar of questions, each party asking the\r\nother where they had been, and where they supposed themselves to be now,\r\nand where they thought they were going.\r\n\r\n“This is a most incomprehensible thing!” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“How long have you been on the road, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Not over a quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been in the woods all the time?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, walking steadily in this direction.”\r\n\r\n“And could you manage to keep a straight course?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t walk along the cliff--did you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“O, no.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you managed to go on straight when you were in the\r\nwoods.”\r\n\r\n“O, I managed by my eye,” said the doctor, calmly. “I also tried to\r\ncorrect that tendency to swerve to the right that you spoke of, and I\r\nthink I succeeded. You see, I found I was very much farther away from\r\nHall’s Harbor than I supposed. In fact, your conjecture must have been\r\nright, and we were nearer Scott’s Bay by a great deal than we were to\r\nHall’s Harbor. We had swerved very much to the right. As I went on I\r\nbecame convinced of this, and tried constantly and most carefully to\r\nguard against it. I succeeded therefore in going almost in a perfectly\r\nstraight line. But our march was a very fatiguing one, I must confess.\r\nIt grew dark, too, and we were just on the point of giving up, when we\r\ncame to a pasture field, and then found the road. We didn’t see any\r\nhouses near, and couldn’t find how far away any house might be. At first\r\nI thought of going to Hall’s Harbor, but finally I concluded to turn to\r\nthe left, and go on towards Cornwallis. But you, how did you happen to\r\nlose your course so completely? Why, you’ve made a complete circle. You\r\nmust have been turning to the right ever since you left. You’ve got into\r\nthe Hall’s Harbor road, and are now walking straight towards Hall’s\r\nHarbor. What a most extraordinary and most absurd situation! I wouldn’t\r\nhave believed this to be possible, had it not been first for my own\r\nmistake to-day, and now for this one of yours. But it seems to me,\r\nBruce, that your circle has been more complete than mine was. What a\r\ntremendous march you must have made!”\r\n\r\nBruce for a few minutes said nothing. The doctor’s quiet way of\r\ninforming him about his situation bewildered him more than the first\r\ndiscovery had done. A “tremendous” circuit it must indeed have been. How\r\nhad they managed to go so fast, and reach the road before the doctor’s\r\nparty? It must have been that chase after Pat which put them astray.\r\nAfter that they had lost all idea of their way, and had wandered on\r\nblindly, not knowing where they were going, and for that matter not\r\ncaring very much, either.\r\n\r\n“But are you sure that this is the Hall’s Harbor road?” he asked at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes--of course it is. It ought to be--we’ve come far enough to get\r\nto it. What did you think it was?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we thought it was the Scott’s Bay road.”\r\n\r\n“The Scott’s Bay road!” cried the doctor, and burst into a hearty fit of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Bruce, “to tell the truth, we got utterly lost. Pat\r\nbegan chasing a porcupine, and we chased Pat, and followed him wherever\r\nhe went. At last we lost him. So then we didn’t think about reaching\r\nthe road at all, but only about finding him. We went on in the direction\r\nwhich he seemed to have taken, and so we came to this road. It was the\r\nporcupine that led us here.\r\n\r\n“The porcupine,” said the doctor; and he appeared so amused at this\r\nidea, that Bruce had to tell him the whole story.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said the doctor, thoughtfully, after hearing this story,\r\n“what you ought to have done is this: You ought at all hazards to have\r\nfollowed the line of the cliff. That would have brought you to Scott’s\r\nBay in a little more than an hour. You could then have gone to the house\r\nwhere the horses were left, and by this time you would have been in\r\ncomfortable quarters, pitying us poor wanderers.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “we tried to keep close by the cliff, but it ran off\r\nin such a direction that we left it, and went in what we thought a truer\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the doctor. “That is always the way. The cliff was\r\nright, but you were wrong. The cliff did not turn away from you, but you\r\nturned away from the cliff. It was all that fatal tendency to turn to\r\nthe right. Now, I was on my guard; but you, who gave me that warning,\r\nforgot all about it yourself. But come, it won’t do to stand here all\r\nnight talking. We are now about half way over the mountain. We ought\r\nsoon to begin to descend towards Cornwallis. There’s a man who lives on\r\nthis road that I’m acquainted with,--a Mr. Smalley,--and his house\r\ncan’t be very far away. We can get something to eat there at least, and\r\naccommodations for the night. But I prefer getting wagons and driving\r\nover to where we left our own conveyances. However, we can see about\r\nthat when we get to Smalley’s.”\r\n\r\nThe whole party now walked on, and the boys mingled with one another,\r\nquestioning each other about the journey. The doctor’s party had\r\nsuffered fearfully. They were all foot-sore, and their clothes were\r\nbadly torn. They had gone through swamps and brushwood, and over stones\r\nand fallen trees. They were fearfully fatigued, and were now only\r\nsustained by the prospect of soon reaching the end of their journey.\r\nAll this was a great puzzle to Bruce’s party, who were not nearly so\r\nfatigued; and they couldn’t understand how they could have gone so much\r\nfarther than the doctor’s party without feeling so worn out as their\r\nfriends were. They attributed this, however, first to the fact that\r\nthe doctor had gone in one perfectly straight course, regardless of\r\nobstacles; and secondly, to the other fact, that their journey had been\r\nbeguiled by Pat’s adventure with the porcupine, which first afforded\r\nthem amusement, and afterwards, when he was lost, created such an\r\nexcitement that they forgot their toils.\r\n\r\nAfter walking some distance farther, the road, to their great delight,\r\nbegan to descend.\r\n\r\n“We’re going down to Cornwallis,” said the doctor, joyously. “We’re very\r\nmuch farther on than I supposed. We are evidently far beyond Smalley’s.\r\nI see how it is. In my anxiety to avoid swerving to the right, I have\r\nfallen, as you said, Bruce, into the opposite extreme, and have actually\r\nswerved to the left. That accounts for the immense length of our\r\njourney. Well, now that it’s over, I’m glad that it happened so. It\r\nbrings us all the nearer to our destination. At the foot of the hill\r\nlives Mr. Atkins, who will give us far better accommodation than\r\nSmalley. One mile more, boys, only one mile, and then we’ll have rest.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s encouraging words cheered all the boys, and the fact that\r\nthey were actually descending the hill, and were thus every moment\r\ndrawing nearer to their destination, had an additional influence in\r\ngiving them fresh energy.\r\n\r\nSo they descended farther and farther, and now kept on the lookout more\r\nvigilantly than ever for the welcome lights of some houses.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long descent,” said the doctor, “but every step is bringing us\r\nnearer to Atkins’s; so keep your courage up, boys, for we’ll soon be\r\nthere now.”\r\n\r\nOn they went, and descended lower and lower, till at last they seemed to\r\nhave reached the plain, for the road became level, and went on straight,\r\nwithout any more windings.\r\n\r\nAt length there appeared a faint light not far away on the left.\r\n\r\n“That must be Atkins’s,” said the doctor. “But how very thick the fog is\r\neven here! I never knew it so thick in Cornwallis. And the air is just\r\nlike that of the sea-shore. It is very seldom that it is so on this side\r\nof the mountain.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s the strong southerly wind,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I dare say.”\r\n\r\n“The wind seems to strike us here from a very odd direction. It must\r\ncome across the Basin of Minas. It’s just as though it came from the\r\neast.”\r\n\r\n“O, we can’t tell,” said the doctor. “This road winds so that we get it\r\nsometimes in our faces, and sometimes in our backs.”\r\n\r\n“It must be after nine,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the doctor; “and I dare say we’ve passed several houses on\r\nthe road. The people here are not very liberal in the use of candles.\r\nThey sit around the kitchen fire till about nine o’clock, and then go\r\nto bed. That’s the reason why we have not seen any lights. There must be\r\nquite a number of houses along here.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they had come in front of the house. It stood about a dozen\r\nyards from the road. The light proceeded from a small, lower window. The\r\nhouse was only a cottage, and the dim outline of a barn could be seen a\r\nlittle farther on.\r\n\r\n“This does not look like Atkins’s,” said the doctor, after he had\r\nscanned the cottage and the barn. “Atkins’s is very much larger than\r\nthis, and is a different looking place altogether. I don’t think we can\r\nhave passed it. No, it must be farther on. At any rate, we can ask here,\r\nand they can tell us exactly how far we have yet to go. I’m sorry it\r\nisn’t Atkins’s, though, for I fully expected to be there. Besides, we\r\nall want rest.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked once more at the house, and then at the barn. As they\r\nstood there, thus looking in silence, there came to their ears a very\r\npeculiar sound, which made every one start.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, rolling sound, made up of the rush of many waters, such\r\nas can be heard nowhere else but upon the sea-shore--that peculiar noise\r\nof gathering floods, such as is heard when the sea throws forth its\r\nwaves towards the land, to curl up, foaming, and break upon the strand.\r\nHere it arose amid this darkness,--that peculiar, that unmistakable\r\nsound,--with its gathering waters, its foam, its roll, and its crash as\r\nthe uplifted waters broke,--the sound that can be made by the surf, and\r\nthe surf alone.\r\n\r\nBut what did it mean?\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of the surf breaking thus upon the inner side of\r\nthe North Mountain, far inland, on the plains of Cornwallis?\r\n\r\nWere the dikes broken down? Was this some flood pouring in over\r\nthe country to overwhelm them? Was the raging sea now rolling, in\r\nundisturbed possession of its ancient bed, over all the green valleys of\r\nthis lately smiling plain? Was there the terrific visitation of a deluge\r\nhere in this peaceful country? and were all the people now flying from\r\nthe horrors of an inundation?\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean?\r\n\r\nUp to this moment there had not been a doubt in the minds of any of them\r\nthat they were near Atkins’s, somewhere in Cornwallis, on the Hall’s\r\nHarbor road. The doctor’s quiet positiveness, the perfect certainty with\r\nwhich he had spoken, and the minute acquaintance which he seemed to\r\nhave with every part of their past and present journey, all conspired\r\nto impress upon the minds of the boys the very idea of their possible\r\nlocality which was in his own mind; and thus it happened that it was\r\nwhile they fully believed themselves entering upon a wide plain that\r\nthey suddenly heard the thunder of the surf upon the shore.\r\n\r\nThe doctor heard this as plainly as any of them, of course, and all the\r\nthoughts which came to them came to him also none the less vividly. But\r\nhe said not a single word.. He stood mute, and waited for a few moments\r\nlonger, as though doubting the evidence of his senses.\r\n\r\nOnce more the sound arose. The waters gathered themselves together, they\r\nrolled forward, they heaped themselves upward, they foamed, and then\r\nthey broke upon the shore. Thus, wave after wave, the surf came on, and\r\nspoke of the presence of the sea!\r\n\r\nIt was enough.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where in the world we have got to,” ejaculated the doctor,\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be Cornwallis,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“We must be on the shore of Minas Basin,” said Bogud.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s Pereau,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where it is,” said the doctor; “but, Bruce, I shouldn’t be\r\nsurprised if you should prove right a second time. But the best way is\r\nto go and ask.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the doctor hurried to the door of the cottage. As they drew\r\nnear, a strong smell of fish arose, and formed a new and striking\r\nproof of the presence of the sea. Reaching the door, the doctor knocked\r\nloudly, and all the boys gathered round to hear the result of his\r\ninquiry, and learn their fate.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no response.\r\n\r\nThe doctor knocked again.\r\n\r\nFootsteps were now heard, and a voice cried out,--\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“Friends,” said the doctor. “We’ve lost our way, and want to find it.”\r\n\r\n“Go round to the back door; this’n won’t open,” said the voice.\r\n\r\nAt this they turned away to look for the back door, wondering, as they\r\nwent, what the occupant of the house supposed a front door was made\r\nfor. It seemed to them like stories which they had read of some Dutch\r\nvillages, where the people are so excessively neat that the “front door”\r\n and the “best room” are never used except on two great occasions; one\r\nbeing a marriage, and the other a burial. At all other times the back\r\ndoor and the back rooms are used.\r\n\r\nSo to this back door they tried to work their way round the house. As\r\nthey went round, the smell of decayed fish came up more strongly, more\r\noverpoweringly, and more impressively than ever. Evidently the people of\r\nthe cottage had something to do with fish. They either caught them,\r\nor traded in them, or cured them. Who were they? Was it Pereau--or was\r\nit--what?\r\n\r\nTurning the house, the fresh wind came upon them, driving against them\r\nthe dense fog clouds, and hiding everything before them from view. But\r\nthrough that gloom there swept upon their hearing a recurrence of the\r\nsolemn boom of the surf which had startled them a few moments before,\r\nwhen they first paused to look at the cottage. There it came, the sound\r\nof the gathering waters, rising gradually, breaking, and flinging the\r\nroar of the falling waters far away along the shore.\r\n\r\nHere they were, then, by the sea; here the surf rolled; here were the\r\nsigns of fish. Evidently these people were fishermen, and their life was\r\non the ocean wave. Suddenly they encountered some large object which was\r\nright in their way. Through the gloom they could see the outline of a\r\nwhaling boat, that is, a boat sharp at both ends, which is often used\r\nby fishermen in these waters. This excited no surprise, however. It\r\nonly confirmed what had been told them by the booming surf and the odors\r\nwafted from the decaying fish.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the rear of the house they found the aforsaid back door wide\r\nopen, and a man standing in the doorway, with a candle in one hand and\r\na pipe in the other. The candle flared, and flickered, and sputtered in\r\nthe wind and fog; and he was blinking through the darkness, and trying\r\nto catch a glimpse of his visitors.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, thick-set, red-faced man, with whiskers running\r\nall round in a “sea dog” sort of fashion, checked shirt, and canvas\r\ntrousers, which bore numerous marks made by tar. His waistcoat was\r\nunbuttoned, so as to give free play to the organs of his manly chest. He\r\nhad no coat, and, for that matter, no boots. In point of fact, he was in\r\nhis stocking feet. His grizzled hair and beard showed him to belong\r\nto the elderly class of mankind; but his stout, sturdy frame and bluff\r\ncountenance exhibited no decay of strength.\r\n\r\n“Lost yer way?” said he, as he caught sight of them. “Wal, come in, any\r\nhow. We’ll talk it over. Walk in, all on ye, the whole fifty of ye, for\r\nthat matter. Ole Bennie Grigg can find room for ye. Walk in, walk in.”\r\n\r\n“But where are we?” asked the doctor. “What place is this?”\r\n\r\n“What place? Haw, haw, haw! What! don’t you even know the place? Haw,\r\nhaw, haw! Why, this here place is Scott’s Bay!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_Old Bennie and Mrs. Bennie.--Old-fashioned Hospitality.--What old\r\nBennie was able to spread before his famished Guests.--A Night on a\r\nHay-mow.--A secluded Village.--A Morning Walk.--Behind Time.--Hurrah,\r\nBoys!_\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTT’S BAY!\r\n\r\nThe emotions of the doctor and all his party, on hearing that name, can\r\nbetter be imagined than described. At first they could scarcely believe\r\nit; but finally, seeing that they knew nothing at all about it, and that\r\nBennie Grigg, as he called himself, might be supposed to know where\r\nhe was living, they were forced to admit the truth of the amazing\r\nstatement. But Bennie gave them no time for wonder. He forced them all\r\nto come in, and ushered them into a large room, where a bright wood fire\r\nwas blazing upon an ample hearth. Here his wife received the unexpected\r\nguests. She was a quiet, quaint, comfortable body, fit helpmeet for\r\nBennie, and received them in the most cordial maimer. With the true\r\nspirit of hospitality, Bennie forbore from asking any question, but\r\ndevoted his whole energies towards making his guests comfortable. He\r\npulled forward an old-fashioned settee, drew forth the quaint, old,\r\nhigh-backed chairs, and soon had a circle of seats arranged around the\r\nfire, where all could be accommodated. After this his wife spread the\r\ncloth over a large table, and began to make preparations for a repast.\r\n\r\n“You’ll be fairly starving?” said Bennie to the doctor, interrogatively.\r\n\r\nThe doctor acknowledged that they were hungry, but begged Bennie not to\r\nput himself out. Bread, and butter, and milk were all that they wanted.\r\n\r\nAt this Bennie laughed, and Mrs. Bennie laughed also, and the latter\r\nbusied herself in getting ready the repast.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Bennie was thus employed, Mr. Bennie assisted her, and, at\r\nthe same time, urged his guests to make themselves comfortable. So they\r\ntalked with one another around the fire, and at length relapsed into\r\nsilence. The fact is, they were all awfully hungry.\r\n\r\nAt last the table was spread.\r\n\r\nAnd such a spread!\r\n\r\nO, ye farmers of Cornwallis! ye fishermen of Scott’s Bay! Are there,\r\nindeed, other farmers and other fishermen on this terrestrial ball that\r\ncan make extemporaneous spreads like yours? I doubt it.\r\n\r\nFor here Bennie and his wife spread out Broiled salmon,\r\n\r\nHam and eggs,\r\n\r\nMealy potatoes,\r\n\r\nCream cheese,\r\n\r\nTea,\r\n\r\nCoffee,\r\n\r\nCream,\r\n\r\nApple sauce,\r\n\r\nBroiled chicken,\r\n\r\nMince pies,\r\n\r\nApple pies,\r\n\r\nCold corn beef,\r\n\r\nCold roast beef,\r\n\r\nCold fillet of veal,\r\n\r\nFresh bread,\r\n\r\nHot rolls,\r\n\r\nPickles,\r\n\r\nCold ham,\r\n\r\nChow-chow,\r\n\r\nTomato ketchup,\r\n\r\nGinger pop,\r\n\r\nCurrant wine,\r\n\r\nCranberry preserves,\r\n\r\nPlum preserves,\r\n\r\nQuince preserves,\r\n\r\nCake,\r\n\r\nBacon,\r\n\r\nSmoked herrings,\r\n\r\nAlewives,\r\n\r\nFinnen haddies,\r\n\r\nSalad,\r\n\r\nBuckwheat pancakes,\r\n\r\nMushroom ketchup,\r\n\r\nPickled oysters,\r\n\r\nMaple honey,\r\n\r\nJohnny cakes, and various other articles of a minor character.\r\n\r\nAll of which the starving wayfarers attacked with ravenous appetites,\r\nwhile Mr. and Mrs. Bennie looked on with faces that beamed all over with\r\ninexpressible gratification.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the first cravings of hunger were satisfied that Bennie\r\nventured to speak to his guests about their wanderings. The doctor then\r\ntold him all.\r\n\r\nIn the full discussion that followed the whole thing was made plain, and\r\ntheir wanderings were all accounted for.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it was seen that Bruce’s party, in spite of their\r\ncarelessness, and of their chase after Pat, had actually reached the\r\npoint at which they had aimed, viz., the Scott’s Bay road, and were on\r\ntheir way to the place where the horses were kept, when the doctor met\r\nthem and turned them back.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the doctor’s wanderings with his party now became\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nHe had set out with the idea in his mind of avoiding that fatal tendency\r\nto swerve to the right of which Bruce had spoken.\r\n\r\nBut against this he had guarded so carefully, that it had led to a\r\nswerving in the opposite direction, as he himself had already partially\r\nacknowledged. That is to say, he had steadily swerved to the left.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that he had led his followers over a long and\r\nfatiguing journey, in a complete circle, until at last he had actually\r\nbrought them into the Scott’s Bay road. But he, thinking he had gone in\r\nan exact straight line, supposed it to be the Hall’s Harbor road. As he\r\nwished to go to Cornwallis, he had, therefore, turned to the left, and\r\ngone forward under this false idea, and thus had met Bruce’s party, who\r\nwere going in the proper direction. He had made them turn back with him,\r\nand had thus led them to Scott’s Bay, never imagining that he could be\r\nwrong until that awful moment when the ominous roar of the surf showed\r\nhim that he must be very far away from where he supposed himself to be.\r\n\r\nOld Bennie laughed loud and long as he listened to the story of their\r\nwanderings, and his laughter struck pleasantly and cheerily upon their\r\nears. For they had all been refreshed by the generous repast which their\r\nhost had spread before them, and a new life had arisen within them.\r\nTheir past wanderings were now nothing more than amusing reminiscences.\r\nThe table lay before them with its bounteous store; beside them the big\r\nbroad hearth sustained its load of crackling fire logs, among which\r\nthe flames danced and leaped up merrily; and there was in the broad\r\nold-fashioned apartment a certain joyous and social atmosphere, beneath\r\nwhose influence all their natures relaxed into a kindly and genial glow.\r\nAnd thus it came to pass that the repast afforded a full and complete\r\ncompensation for all the toils of the day.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night variously. The doctor had a room to himself. The\r\nsettee formed a bed on which Jiggins and Bogud reposed. Sammy and Johnny\r\nBlue slumbered on straw beds stretched on the floor. As for the rest,\r\nthey slept in the barn, on the hay, which they preferred to anything\r\nwhich the house could offer. Bennie tried to tempt them with various\r\nmattresses spread over the kitchen floor; but they chose the haymow, and\r\nBennie himself finally declared that such a choice showed their sense.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came. They all arose refreshed. The fog had all cleared\r\naway, the sun shone brightly, and all the scene were displayed before\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nThey found Scott’s Bay village to be a place of about five hundred\r\ninhabitants, who lived chiefly by fishing, to which they added farming.\r\nThere was also a ship-yard here, which occasionally, in a busy seasop,\r\nadded largely to the population. The houses were generally neat, and\r\nsituated along the road.\r\n\r\nAll around the scenery was magnificent. The bay was a small indentation\r\nbehind Blomidon, formed by a long, projecting spur of the North\r\nMountain, which ran on one side of the Straits of Minas, and terminated\r\nin those rugged and sublime fragments of shattered and storm-riven rock\r\nthat give to that point the name of Cape Split. The beach was a long\r\ncrescent, that extended for about two miles, and was bounded at either\r\nextremity by lofty precipices. Before it lay the blue waters of the Bay\r\nof Fundy, with the long precipitous line of coast on either side; and\r\nimmediately in front, though many miles away, rose a solitary island,\r\nwith perpendicular sides and flat summit, known by the name of Ile\r\nHaute, both to the old Acadians, who thus named it, and to their English\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nThat day was Sunday, and they had to remain in the village. The doctor,\r\nhowever, found occupation. There was no clergyman stationed here, but\r\nthere was a little chapel, where services were held about once a month.\r\nHere he performed the duties of his sacred office, and the villagers,\r\nhearing of his arrival, turned out in force. The doctor had a crowded\r\nhouse, and was so gratified by their attendance in the morning, and so\r\ntouched by their quiet but earnest attention, that he held forth again\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAs to the mistake that the doctor had made, he acknowledged it in the\r\nhandsomest manner. In the presence of all the boys, he said that Bruce\r\nhad been right, and he had been wrong. He acknowledged his ignorance of\r\nthe woods, and advised them, if they ever again went roaming through the\r\nforest, never to trust to the guidance of a doctor of divinity. He\r\nfelt that he might be of some small service in guiding them through\r\nfigurative forests,--in pointing out the true way through that “obscure\r\nwood” by which Dante once symbolized this world of man,--but as to ever\r\nagain leading them, or having anything to do with them in any literal,\r\nmaterial wood, he begged to be excused; and he also advised them not\r\nto have anything to do with him. He praised them all for their patient\r\nendurance in following him, and hoped finally that they would look back\r\nupon this adventure with such pleasant memories that all the troubles\r\nthat they had endured would be forgotten.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every one of the boys declared that they had had a\r\nmost delightful time, and that they would not want a better leader than\r\nthe doctor; all of which showed plainly that the toil and trouble of\r\nthese wanderings had already been forgotten in the peace and pleasure\r\nwhich had marked their journey’s end.\r\n\r\nThere remained now the consideration of their homeward journey. On\r\nSaturday night the doctor had spoken to Bennie about it, and Bennie\r\nsaid he would see about getting conveyances for them as far as the place\r\nwhere the doctor’s horses had been left. But the doctor refused to let\r\nhim make any arrangements on Sunday. As he wished to be back at Grand\r\nPré on Monday in time to begin the school, he saw that it would be\r\nimpossible to get Bennie’s conveyances without breaking the Sabbath. But\r\nhe couldn’t do this. So there was only one alternative; and that was,\r\nto start very early on Monday morning, and walk to the place where the\r\nhorses were. This he determined to do.\r\n\r\nSo, on Monday morning, at four, they all rose, and after partaking of\r\na substantial breakfast, they bade Mr. and Mrs. Bennie an affectionate\r\nfarewell, and departed. It was about five before they left. It was past\r\nseven when they reached their destination. The doctor found the horses\r\nand wagons all safe; but it took some time to feed the former, and it\r\nwas after eight o’clock before they were able to start.\r\n\r\nThen they drove home as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the hill at about eleven. But the hour for commencing\r\nschool was nine. The doctor’s family and Messrs. Simmons and Long were\r\nquite anxious about the absentees. The school had not been opened. They\r\nwere waiting for the return of the wanderers.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, when the wanderers at length returned, they found that their\r\ndelay had resulted in giving them an additional holiday.\r\n\r\nFor the school could not begin on that day. That was evident.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they found themselves blessed with another reprieve from study.\r\n\r\nHurrah, boys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Great Excitement.--What is it?--Pat busy among the small Boys.--A\r\ngreat Supper, and a sudden Interruption.--The Midnight Knell.--General\r\nUproar.--Flight of the Grand Panjandrum.--A solemn Time.--In the\r\nDark.--Bold Explorers.--The Cupola, and the Abyss beneath.--The\r\nDiscovery._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT afternoon Pat was very busy among the smaller boys. He asked them\r\nmany questions about the noise in the attic, and found there was great\r\nterror among them. For the noises had been heard both on Saturday night\r\nand Sunday night by those who were in that building; and they were so\r\nterrified that they would not have staid there a third night if the\r\nother boys had not come back. A superstitious awe had settled down deep\r\ninto their minds, and they conversed with one another on this subject in\r\nsubdued whispers.\r\n\r\nPat found them in this condition, and managed to make them still more\r\nterrified before he left them. Some of them were anxious to tell one of\r\nthe teachers about it all; but Pat dissuaded them by declaring that it\r\nwould be of no use, and that they would only be laughed at for their\r\npains.\r\n\r\nMany of the other boys also, on coming back, felt a return of their\r\nformer fear, and looked forward to the approach of night with some\r\nuneasiness. Pat made himself quite busy with these boys, too; and\r\nalthough he said nothing very directly, yet he made many mysterious\r\nhints that implied a great deal. He alluded to his own fearful position,\r\nwith his bed in that very garret, separated by only a board partition\r\nfrom the dark haunts of the mystery. He spoke of his past experience;\r\nand it seemed as though, if he only chose, he could easily unfold a tale\r\nwhose lightest word would harrow up their souls. Only he didn’t. The\r\nboys begged him to tell all. But Pat wouldn’t. He shook his head with\r\ndeep and solemn meaning. And the boys looked on him with a profounder\r\nawe. And Pat, when he went up to his haunted chamber, was regarded as\r\nsome poor victim on his way to his doom.\r\n\r\nPat, however, was not regarded in this light by all. Some there were who\r\nheld aloof from this feeling of awe. Among these was Bart, who could\r\nnot help noticing Pat’s movements, and was very much impressed by them,\r\nthough in a way very different from that in which the other boys were\r\naffected. He saw how Pat managed to stimulate the excited imaginations\r\nof others without saying anything directly, and heard him lament most\r\nlachrymosely his hard fate in having to occupy a room in so fearful a\r\nplace. He happened to be near the group to which Pat was talking, and\r\ncould not help saying,--\r\n\r\n“Well, Pat, my room’s just underneath yours, and if anything happens,\r\nyou can take refuge with me. I’ll give you a sofa for the night.”\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an you’ll find me comin down some night,” said Pat, “ony\r\nmaybe I mightn’t iver git down there. Maybe the same thing that would\r\ndhrive me down might prevint me goin down.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I’ll tell you what to do: you yell like Old Harry, and I’ll\r\ngo up.”\r\n\r\n“You’d niver get up.”\r\n\r\n“Never get up? Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t let you.”\r\n\r\n“It? What It?”\r\n\r\n“Why, It--the wan that walks.”\r\n\r\n“The one that walks? That’s just what it doesn’t do. It’s very bad at\r\nwalking.”\r\n\r\n“You’d soon see, if ye’d iver find him. Any how, he’d shtop yer comin\r\ntill my room.”\r\n\r\n“Stop me? Nonsense! How can it stop me, when it’s in the cupola?”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Bart looked in an expressive manner at Pat.\r\n\r\nPat looked away, and shook his head. Whether he suspected that Bart know\r\nall or not, he did not give him back any look of intelligence, or show\r\nany confusion. He simply looked away, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Well, well,--aich wan must have his own opinion. Well know betther\r\nperhaps some day.” Bart smiled, and turned away. Soon he joined Bruce\r\nand Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I’ve given Pat one or two hints already,” said he, “that I saw through\r\nthe business, and I’ve just given him another. It’s a shame for him to\r\ngo frightening the small boys that way. I was going to arrange it all\r\nto-morrow, or next day, so that they would look on it as a joke. But\r\nPat is keeping up the gloomy, tragic character, and there’ll be more\r\ndisturbance. Only he’d better look out. I’ve given him fair warning.\r\nThere’s poor little Harry Thompson, with his face as pale as a sheet. It\r\nisn’t fair. It’ll have to be stopped.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we stop it to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no; we had better wait till we see if it goes on, and whether\r\nPat’s hand can be discerned in it. If we do find it so, I really don’t\r\nsee any reason why he should be spared.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that Bart had already made his friends\r\nacquainted with the discovery which he had made in the garret, and that\r\nthey had decided upon some general plan of action. They did not wish\r\nto put an end to the affair too prematurely or clumsily, but rather to\r\nterminate it in as brilliant a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nAs this day was positively the last of the holidays, the “B. O. W. C”\r\n determined to celebrate it by a modest supper in the Rawdons’ rooms.\r\nSolomon was accordingly called upon, and, as always, he showed himself\r\nequal to the occasion, Personally, he was all smiles and joyousness.\r\nHis little black beads of eyes twinkled incessantly, his face actually\r\nshone, and his complexion was a rich, oily sepia. He made desperate\r\nefforts to preserve an air of profound solemnity; but occasionally a\r\nshort, sharp snort of a laugh would burst forth, after which his face\r\nwould at once regain its mask of gravity.\r\n\r\n“Dar!” said he, as he put the last dish on. “Dar! blubbed breddern, dis\r\nheah’s all in hona ob dis great an shinin casium. You hab now finished\r\nyour high an mighty ventures. Dar you hab bess ob ’Cad’my fare; none\r\nbut de brave, you know, deserb dat fare. Off you go to lib on lasses\r\nan pork, an come back to vive you healt by de neficient car ob ole\r\nSolomon. Den off you clar agin, jes like mad, an git half starbed, so\r\nhab to come back agin to de tractions heah. An now, blubbed breddern,\r\npitch in. Heah’s turkey, an chicken, an sass, an mince pies, an apple\r\ntarts, an pickled ’ysters, an red-hot coffee, an cream, an fifty oder\r\ntings too noomrous to mentium. Fur fudda ticulars, gemmen, see small\r\nbills. Yours, truly.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Solomon welcomed them to the feast that he had\r\nprepared. The boys seated themselves around the groaning board, and gave\r\nthemselves up to the joy of the occasion. They fought their battles o’er\r\nagain. They went over all the events of the holidays. Again they drifted\r\nthrough the dense fog, or wandered through the trackless forest; again\r\nthey waded through deep waters, or dug deep in the solid ground.\r\n\r\nAs they thus chattered and laughed, Solomon stood surveying them with a\r\nbeaming smile illuminating all his dark but expressive features; and all\r\nthe time he kept whispering to himself words expressive of his feelings\r\non “dat ar casium.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly all this was interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was late. All was still. All the other boys seemed to have gone to\r\nbed. Outside, the night was quite dark. And then and there, amid that\r\nstillness and in that darkness, it rang out right over their heads.\r\n\r\nIt was again that peculiar sound which they had once before heard, a\r\nlong, shrill, abrupt, discordant shriek, repeated again and again, and\r\nechoing dismally throughout the gloomy extent of the long, unfinished\r\ngarret, and dying away in the far distances with low and melancholy\r\nintonations. The ceiling above them only intervened between this room\r\nand the garret, so that they could hear it very plainly.\r\n\r\nAs the sound rang out, Solomon started. He was that moment lifting\r\na plate, and the plate fell from his nerveless hands crashing on the\r\nfloor. His face seemed to turn to a sickly greenish-brown; he staggered\r\nback, and leaned against the wall.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nThis completed Solomon’s horror. His knees gave way, his teeth\r\nchattered, his eyes rolled fearfully. He sank upon the floor, and\r\nremained there in a sitting posture.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” shouted Bruce. “Hallo, Solomon! What’s the matter? Get\r\nup. Are you faint? Here, take a drink of water. Why, man, what’s the\r\nmatter?”\r\n\r\nEncouraged by Bruce’s words, Solomon made a great effort, and got up,\r\nedging away behind the boys as far from the-door as he could get.\r\n\r\nNo one had come in. And so Arthur went to the door, and opened it.\r\nNobody was there.\r\n\r\nAs he stood wondering, Jiggins’s door opened, and Jiggins made his\r\nappearance, clad in the habiliments of the night.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Jiggins!” said Arthur. “Did you knock?”\r\n\r\n“Me? Knock? Me? No,” said Jiggins. “I--I was just in bed, and asleep,\r\nand heard that howl above; and then there came a knock. I thought it was\r\nyou, wanting to see me.”\r\n\r\n“No; none of us knocked.”\r\n\r\n“Somebody did, then.”\r\n\r\n“And some one knocked at our door, too,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean?” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other boys were out in the hall, and were looking at\r\none another. Bart looked along the floor, to see if the knock could\r\nhave been produced by a stone thrown. Behind Tom might be seen Solomon,\r\nafraid to be too far behind, and yet not daring to venture forward.\r\n\r\n“It’s queer,’ said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it,” said Jiggins, solemnly. “It somehow don’t seem\r\nright. I feel really uncomfortable. There’s something about\r\nthat--is--not--right.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, “shall we go up again?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we may as well.”\r\n\r\n“O, it’s no use,” said Arthur. “There’s nothing more. Still, this knock\r\nought to be investigated.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go, then.”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” groaned Solomon. “No--don’t--doo-on’t go; don’t go an leab dis\r\npore ’stracted nigga ’posed to sich clamties. Don’t leab a ’flicted ole\r\ndarky to de powers of darkness.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Solomon. Don’t be afraid. You wait here till we come back.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t! Darsn’t!” cried Solomon. “Neb-ber, nebber lib troo dat ar\r\nsperiment. No, Mas’r Bart, _you_ won’t leab a ole fool; _you’ll_ stan by\r\na ole man.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Bart. “I’ll see you down stairs, if you like. Come.”\r\n\r\nAt that instant there sounded out a deep toll from the great bell in\r\nthe cupola. It was one single toll, but so profound, so awful, and so\r\nsolemn, did that solitary knell peal forth through the still night\r\nair, that even those who felt no fear could not avoid an involuntary\r\nsensation of awe.\r\n\r\nSolomon clutched at Bart’s arm, and looked as though he had no life left\r\nin him.\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” said Bart. “That’s a little too much, boys. We’ll\r\nhave to wind this thing up--won’t we? Bring along a light, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“O, Mas’r Bart! get me home,” groaned Solomon. “I member you when you\r\nwor a chile. I used to give you candy. Don let me be gobbled up.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Solomon. Come along; I’ll see you safe down, and then you can\r\nrun for it to your room. Wait a minute, boys.”\r\n\r\nDown went Bart, with Solomon, shuddering and quaking, at his heels, and\r\nfinally reached the door.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, Solomon,” he said, “run for it.”\r\n\r\nAway went Solomon, in a frenzy of fear, his whole frame shuddering in\r\nvague superstitious terror, his brain reeling with excitement, his\r\nfancy crowded with images of horror. Away he went; he burst into the\r\nboarding-house, he raced up the stairs, he rushed into his room as\r\nbefore, banged all the furniture against the door, and lay crouched in a\r\ncorner, and quaking till morning.\r\n\r\nBart returned at once.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said Jiggins, “it’s a solemn time--a deeply solemn time!”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you come up, Jiggins?”\r\n\r\n“No, boys,” said Jiggins; “and I warn you not to go up. That’s a solemn\r\nplace--a deeply solemn place.”\r\n\r\n“Well, come up, and help us to feel the solemnity,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the looks of it,” said he. “It’s too solemn. There’s a\r\ncertain something about it that makes me feel a--kind of a--a degree of\r\na--solemnity--that--a--”\r\n\r\nBut Jiggins’s voice died away upon the ears of the boys, as they\r\nascended the stairs, before he could finish what he was trying to say.\r\n\r\nThe object of the boys in going up now was, first, to find the cause\r\nof the knock, and secondly, to find the cause of the tolling bell. They\r\nthought that perhaps some one might be concealed in the attic, and so\r\nthey looked about very carefully in all directions. Tom stood at the\r\nhead of the attic stairs, so as to bar the way to any possible fugitive.\r\nThe others then went all over the attic most carefully, beginning at the\r\nend next Pat’s room, and so on over to the open space under the cupola.\r\nCrossing this, they searched all over the farther end. They peeped into\r\nevery nook and corner, they left nothing unexamined. But at length they\r\nwere forced to give up this search, for nothing could be found. Coming\r\nback, therefore, they stood in silence by the open space under the\r\ncupola, and looked down into the gloomy, yawning chasm over which went\r\nthe narrow plank pathway, and tried to peer through the deep gloom of\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nAfter standing here for some time, they crossed to the other side, on\r\ntheir way back, and were hero joined by Tom.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said Bart, “we can’t get at the bottom of that knock; that’s\r\nevident; but we oughtn’t to go till we find out about the bell. What do\r\nyou say to going up?”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Bruce; “only we can’t take the lamps.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not; and even if we did, the wind would blow them out. But\r\nit don’t make any difference about that. We can feel about, you know. If\r\nany one’s in the cupola, we’ll have him, and find out who he is.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll put the lamp on the plank here,” said Tom, “and it will throw some\r\nlight up.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Arthur; “it might get shaken off, and then good by to the old\r\nAcademy. In a quarter of an hour, that old tinder-box below would be in\r\nflames. Put it over there on the floor. Never mind whether it throws up\r\nany light or not. We can all go up in the dark just as well.”\r\n\r\nTom thereupon put his lamp on the solid floor of the garret; and after\r\nthis the whole party walked the plank, and reached the foot of the\r\nladders that ran up to the cupola. There were two of these, and in\r\nclimbing up, one had to work his way through a net-work of beams. In the\r\ndaytime this was troublesome enough to an unpractised hand, and in the\r\ndark would have been impossible. But these boys knew every inch of the\r\nway, and could go up almost as easily in the dark as in the light.\r\n\r\nBart went first, Bruce next, then Arthur, then Phil, and Tom came last.\r\nThe first ladder was slightly slanting in one direction, and terminated\r\nat a narrow board, from which the second ladder went up slanting in an\r\nopposite direction to the cupola. They went up quite nimbly and rapidly,\r\nconsidering the total darkness, and soon reached the cupola.\r\n\r\nBart was up there first.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the cupola, and hanging immediately over the opening\r\nthrough which they came up, was the great bell, whose deep, solemn tones\r\nwere familiar enough to them from the summons which it hourly sent forth\r\nduring term time, but whose solitary knell, sounding as it lately did\r\nin the stillness of the night, had struck such sudden awe into their\r\nhearts. All around the bell was room enough to walk, and to look out of\r\nthe windows of the cupola.\r\n\r\nBart had reached the cupola first, and he at once walked round it to\r\nfind if any one was concealed here. The circuit was made by the time\r\nBruce had come up, who immediately went round, as Bart had done. Then\r\nthe others came up.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Phil, “what’s the luck?”\r\n\r\n“There’s no one here,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Have you felt everywhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“He couldn’t get up above there--could he?”\r\n\r\n“O, no.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he’s outside,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion they all flung open the shutters which surrounded the\r\ncupola, and as it was too dark to see, they felt in all directions with\r\ntheir hands. They soon found, however, that no one was there.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Phil, “the question is, how in the world-could that bell\r\nhave tolled?”\r\n\r\nAll were silent for a few minutes, trying to conjecture some possible\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that on this occasion Bruce had not a vestige of his\r\nformer superstitious feeling. The affair with the donkey had taught\r\nhim a salutary lesson, and the discovery that Bart had made, when\r\ncommunicated to him, had made him angry with himself for the fear which\r\nhe had felt before. He was perfectly convinced now that there was some\r\ntrick, which was the only cause of the knock and the toll of the bell,\r\nand this he tried to discover.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stooped down and felt under the bell.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Well.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think a fellow could ring the bell without coming up into the\r\ncupola, by some very simple process? Do you think a string tied to the\r\ntongue could do it?”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried all, in great excitement; and all of them sprang forward\r\nto feel for themselves.\r\n\r\nBut Bruce warded off their hands.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said he. “The string’s here. Stand back. I want to see where it\r\ngoes to.”\r\n\r\nThe boys fell back now in greater excitement than ever. The string was a\r\ncommon piece of twine. Bruce followed it, and found that it went across\r\nto the side of the cupola, facing their end of the building, and then it\r\nwas passed through a crevice close to the floor, and passed outside.\r\n\r\nBut where?\r\n\r\nBruce pulled the string. The other end was fastened; but by the\r\nresistance he could tell that it ran for a long distance.\r\n\r\n“There’s only one place that it goes to, of course,” said Bart, “and\r\nthat is Pat’s room. But why in the world he should get up this, passes\r\nmy comprehension. We’ll have to teach him a lesson, boys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_A puzzling Position.--How to meet the Emergency.--A strange\r\nSuggestion.--Diamond cut Diamond, or a Donkey in a Garret.--Surprise\r\nof Jiggins on seeing the Stranger.--The fated Moment comes.--The Donkey\r\nconfronts the Garret Noises.--The Power of a Bray._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys remained in the cupola for some time longer. Once Bruce had\r\nthe satisfaction of feeling the string become suddenly tight in his\r\nhands. He held it thus for a moment, as though to assure himself of the\r\nfact and then gave it a sudden pull.\r\n\r\nIt yielded!\r\n\r\nThe whole string was in his hands.\r\n\r\nBruce fell down on the floor, and his whole frame shook with smothered\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“What in the world’s the matter with you, Bruce?” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“The string! ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The string!--ha, ha!--The string!”\r\n\r\n“The string? Well, what about the string?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve got it. I felt it grow tight,--ha, ha, ha!--and I gave it\r\na jerk,--ha, ha, ha!--and it came,--ha, ha, ha, ha!--and now Pat’s\r\nwondering what’s become of it,--ha, ha, ha, ha!--and he’s thinking that\r\nthe ghost he was shamming must be a real one, after all!”\r\n\r\nEither Bruce’s laughter was contagious, or else the boys saw something\r\nirresistibly funny in Pat’s supposed consternation at losing the string;\r\nbut whatever was the cause, the boys burst forth also into fits of\r\nlaughter, which, however, they tried to smother as well as they could.\r\n\r\nAnd now the question was--what to do.\r\n\r\nAt first they were going to take the string away, but they finally\r\ndecided to leave it just as it was, so as to see what Pat would do under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nAfter coming to this conclusion, they decided to go to bed for the\r\nnight, and defer any further consideration of the subject till the\r\nfollowing day, when they would feel fresher and less fatigued. So they\r\ndescended once more, and separated for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they found the excitement greater than ever. All who\r\nwere in the main building had heard the noises of the night, and some in\r\nthe boarding-house had heard the toll of the bell. Jiggins was sad and\r\nexceedingly solemn. Bogud went about saying that none of them could\r\ntell what might happen; which language might be taken to signify an\r\nundeniable truism; or, on the other hand, it might be considered as a\r\nsuggestion of the existence of some profound, gloomy, and inscrutable\r\nmystery. Bogud rather preferred that it should be taken in that light.\r\nMuckle, Johnny, Sammy, and Billymack, all announced that they thought\r\nthere was something in it, and shook their heads with dark meaning and\r\nimpressive emphasis over the whole business. Pat was as usual, only a\r\nlittle more so. He was active in all kinds of hints. He refused to tell\r\nhis own experience of the night, but suggested something grand, gloomy,\r\nand peculiar. He looked like one who wished none to question him about\r\nthe secrets of his prison house. He expressed a mournful resignation to\r\nthat hard fate which made him the neighbor of the fearful denizens of\r\nthe garret, and meekly, but firmly, refused the offers of several boys\r\nto give him accommodation till the trouble should cease. Also, Pat had\r\nan excellent appetite, and his ruddy face and bright eyes belied the\r\ncultivated mournfulness of his expression. Bart had gone up into the\r\ncupola before breakfast, and had found that the string was taken away.\r\nHe at once concluded that Pat had been up, and had quietly removed\r\nit for the day. If he had felt any consternation at having the string\r\njerked from his hands, he had, no doubt, got completely over it, and\r\nprobably attributed it to some ordinary cause, very different from the\r\nreal one.\r\n\r\nPat’s demeanor was such that the boys saw his evident determination to\r\nkeep up the excitement. He went about as before among the small boys,\r\nheightening their fears, and giving any number of dark suggestions to\r\ntheir excited imaginations. Bogud, and Jiggins, and Sammy, and Johnny,\r\nand Billymack, and Muckle also sought Pat’s society, and left it more\r\nconfirmed than ever in their opinions. Jiggins was more than ever\r\nconvinced that it was a deeply solemn season. In fact, he kept saying so\r\nto everybody all day long.\r\n\r\nThe teachers could not be ignorant of the excitement, but they took no\r\nnotice of it. They thought it was some, harmless trick of some of the\r\nmore mischievous boys, which did not call for their intervention as yet,\r\nbut would probably be revealed in the natural course of things. So the\r\nboys were all left to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock the school was once more opened, after so many delays,\r\nand the duties of the new term commenced.\r\n\r\nAlas, the first day of a new term! What a horror it brings to the heart\r\nof a boy! Fresh from the green fields, from the blue sky, from the\r\nfragrant woods, the babbling brook, the sounding shore, the lofty\r\nprecipice, the bounding wave,--from all these he enters into the gloom,\r\nand darkness, and confinement of the school-room. Can there be any\r\nwonder that the fresh, young, boyish heart should quail, and his\r\nbounding young life droop, and his uproarious spirits flag on that\r\ndreary first day? Where is his life, in which of late he so exulted?\r\nWhere is that grand face of Mother Nature, so dear to every boy?\r\nWhere are the odor of the fields, the balsamic air of the forest, the\r\ninvigorating smell of the salt sea? These are the loved memories that\r\nafflict him at his dingy desk. The first day at school for a boy is\r\nhomesickness in its broadest sense. I don’t think anybody can be so\r\nhomesick as a boy may be; nor can a boy at any other time be so homesick\r\nas at such a time as this. Homesickness, moreover, is not merely a\r\npining for one’s actual home, but it is also a yearning for pleasures\r\nthat have fled,--some lost grace of life,--some sweet charm which has\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nNow, none of our boys were at all inclined to what they called\r\n“spooniness” but still they could not help feeling the common evil of boy\r\nhumanity. The school hours passed slowly and heavily, and they tried to\r\ncheer themselves with the thought that it would not be so unpleasant in\r\na few days, after they had become used to it.\r\n\r\nAfter school was over, the “B. O. W. C.” engaged in an earnest\r\ndiscussion over the situation. One common resolution was in all their\r\nminds, and that was, to put an end to the ghost in the garret. But how\r\nwas it to be done?\r\n\r\n“We might quietly go and tell the fellows all about it,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, “but that would be too clumsy. What I want is\r\nsomething more artistic; I want a dramatic close, in which there shall\r\nbe a scene full of effect. If we could only work it so as to let the\r\nthing bring itself to a conclusion in some effective way, it would be a\r\ngreat deal more satisfactory to all concerned.”\r\n\r\n“I should like some way,” said Bruce, “in which Pat would be conscious\r\nthat he was completely used up; and I think that among us five we might\r\narrange a counterplot against his plot.”\r\n\r\n“Pat certainly deserves some sort of punishment for the way he has been\r\nfrightening the small boys. He has been at it all day; I dare say he’s\r\nat it now. Of course before dark he’ll sneak up and fasten his string\r\nto the tongue of the bell again, so as to get all ready for the night’s\r\noperations.”\r\n\r\n“We can easily find some way, I should think,” said Arthur, “of\r\npaying off Pat, without being cruel in any way to him. A smart shock,\r\nadministered delicately and neatly, would about suit my idea of the\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but how can we get something which will be mild, yet\r\nsmart,--delicate, yet effective? That’s the point which we don’t seem\r\nable to decide.”\r\n\r\nAs they talked in this way they were walk? ing up the hill towards the\r\nold French orchard? As they neared the place Bart’s eyes wandered over\r\nthe adjoining pasture field, and rested on the form of that donkey which\r\nhad borne so large a share in the experiences of the past few days.\r\n\r\n“I have it!” he cried, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked they.\r\n\r\n“The donkey!”\r\n\r\n“What about it?”\r\n\r\n“He shall help us.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“The donkey’s our plan. We’ll play him off against the ghost, and Pat!\r\nThe donkey was once a ghost himself. He’ll be the very one to do the\r\nthing up properly; he’s had experience. After performing so successfully\r\nat the hole, at our expense, you can’t place any limit to his capacity.\r\nYes, boys, the donkey’s the very man.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what good the donkey’s going to be,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“What good?--the very thing we want.”\r\n\r\n“How?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Pat won’t come up here to get frightened,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And his room is too far up for us to make the donkey bray under it,”\r\n said Tom.\r\n\r\n“.All very true,” said Bart; “but then what’s to prevent our marching\r\nthe donkey up into the garret?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Marching him up into the garret.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Can you get him up?”\r\n\r\n“Of course we can.”\r\n\r\n“But think of the horrible racket he’d make going up. We couldn’t keep\r\nit secret.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, we could. We could fix him so that he could go up without any\r\nnoise in particular.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Why, by putting bits of carpet around each of his feet. We could then\r\nget him up stairs somehow. A basket of oats, for instance.”\r\n\r\nThe boys thought for a time, and then burst into fits of laughter at the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Bart, “it would be the most magnificent thing ever\r\nundertaken on this hill. Besides, how splendid it would be to bring our\r\nghost face to face with Pat’s own private ghost, and let them confront\r\neach other. What a tremendous, stupendous, overwhelming, and altogether\r\nunparalleled uproar there would be! Pat would then be confronted with\r\nsomething different from anything that he had been calculating on. We’d\r\nbreak down the panic of the boys, and it would all end in a roar of\r\nlaughter.”\r\n\r\n“But what a row there’ll be!” exclaimed Phil.\r\n\r\n“I wonder which party’ll begin,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Pat’s side, of course,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said Tom, “that our side’ll do his duty.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll have to keep him up to it. Donkey’s that can bray, and won’t\r\nbray, must be made to bray.”\r\n\r\n“He’s such an obstinate brute,” said Arthur, “that I don’t believe we’ll\r\nbe able to do anything.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll manage that,” said Bruce. “The five of us are strong enough to\r\npull him along if he won’t go himself.”\r\n\r\n“We can get a whip, or a stout stick somewhere,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart; “no beating if we can help it. I’m averse, on\r\nprinciple, to all corporal punishment. I formed a deep prejudice against\r\nit in my early school days. No, boys: remember what Pope says:\r\n\r\n                        ‘If I had a donkey,\r\n\r\n                             And he wouldn’t go,\r\n\r\n                        D’ye think I’d wallop him?\r\n\r\n                             No, no, no.’\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I would endeavor, if possible, to secure his\r\ncooperation with our plans by the gentler method of moral suasion--oats,\r\nfor instance.” “Or a good fat thistle.”\r\n\r\n“Or a handful of sorrel.”\r\n\r\n“Or a cold boiled turnip.”\r\n\r\n“Or some delicate chickweed.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further consideration they came to the conclusion to make an\r\nattempt to carry out the donkey proposal that very night.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening various things were prepared. A number\r\nof bits of old carpet with some cord were most conspicuous among these\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nTheir plan was based on the supposition that Pat had not heard this\r\ndonkey bray, and was, perhaps, unaware of its existence here. They were\r\nquite sure that he had not been up near the pasture field since\r\nthe donkey came, and so he was probably unaware of its presence.\r\nConsequently when Pat began his little tricks to-night, he would find a\r\nstartling cooperator.\r\n\r\nThe boys waited till all were in bed, and then brought down the donkey.\r\nThey had but little trouble in leading him along. They took him into a\r\ngrove in front of the Academy, and there tied bits of carpet around each\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThen began their efforts to get him up stairs. Here was where they\r\nanticipated failure. But to their surprise this was accomplished without\r\nany very great difficulty. The little animal, tempted by turnips held in\r\nfront of his nose, encouraged by strokings, and pulled and pushed along,\r\nmade a rush up the first flight. He went up as nimbly as a goat, and\r\ndidn’t make more noise than six men pounding up with all their might.\r\nThe noise certainly exceeded all that they had calculated upon.\r\n\r\nThen came the second flight. The donkey went up triumphantly; but by the\r\ntime he reached the top he had lost three of the four bandages in which\r\nhis feet were tied. Here they heard a door open at the foot of the\r\nstairs, and Bogud’s voice calling,--\r\n\r\n“What’s all that? Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“O, nothing. It’s only a new student,” said Bart, quietly.\r\n\r\nBogud’s door closed again.\r\n\r\nThey then led the donkey on. But just as they reached Jiggins’s door,\r\nit opened, and Jiggins put forth his head, holding a candle out, and\r\nblinking at them. To his horror he saw immediately in front of him\r\nthe shaggy companion of the “B. O. W. C.” But at the same moment he\r\nrecognized the boys, and this reassured him.\r\n\r\n“What--what’s all this?” he gasped. “It’s a nightmare,” said Bart;\r\n“we’re taking him up to fight the ghost.”\r\n\r\nAt this the donkey looked amiably at the figure in the doorway, and\r\nmaking a step forward, put his head through, and was about entering when\r\nthe occupant of the room banged the door in his face.\r\n\r\nThe boys then resumed their journey. But the last flight was not passed\r\nwithout a fearful racket, and the donkey lost the remaining bandage. At\r\nlength, however, they reached the top, and walking softly themselves,\r\nthey led the donkey over to a point near where Pat’s room was.\r\n\r\nLeaving him here, they then retired.\r\n\r\nThe donkey was thus left alone to himself, and to a cold boiled turnip,\r\nwhich Bart had put under his nose. After a short season of bewilderment,\r\nhe proceeded to regale himself on this.\r\n\r\nThe “B. O. W. C.” all separated, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe characters in this drama were left to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nNow Pat, in his room at the end of the long garret, had heard the racket\r\nmade by the donkey in coming up, and at first did not know what to make\r\nof it. At length, however, the noise ceased, and for about half an hour\r\nall was still.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a loud, wild shriek from afar through the long\r\ngarret, followed by others in succession.\r\n\r\nBut Pat did not quake, or shiver--not he.\r\n\r\nHe waited for a few minutes with a pleasant smile of keen enjoyment on\r\nhis face. Then he went to the window of his room, and pulled a string,\r\nwhich came in from the outside.\r\n\r\nAnd there followed a deep, solemn toll, that broke upon the stillness\r\nof the night with a gloomy and awful intonation, carrying terror to many\r\npoor little boys, who heard it and quaked with superstitious fear.\r\n\r\nThe donkey had finished his turnip!\r\n\r\nHe had begun to reflect on the peculiarity of his situation!\r\n\r\nAll dark around. No pleasant pasture, no starlit sky--nothing but utter\r\ndarkness. He felt uncomfortable. He stood fixed in one spot, and the\r\nvery unusual situation told heavily upon his spirits.\r\n\r\nHad he been in some comfortable stall, or some sequestered pasture, he\r\nmight have lain down and slept the sleep of the donkey. But he had been\r\nbadgered and deceived, and such a getting up stairs he never had seen.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the midst of these reflections, there came this uproar of\r\nshrieks and tolling bells. It was too much. It was not at all what he\r\nwas accustomed to.\r\n\r\nSo he proceeded to enter a protest against the whole business.\r\n\r\nThe donkey raised his head!\r\n\r\nHe elevated his tail!\r\n\r\nHe spread his legs apart so as to gain a firmer attitude!\r\n\r\nThen he burst forth:\r\n\r\n                   He! haw! He! Haw!\r\n\r\n                   Heeeeee! Haaaaaaw!\r\n\r\n                   He! haw! He! haw!\r\n\r\n                   He haaaaaaaaaw!\r\n\r\n                   Heeeeeeeeeee!\r\n\r\n                   Haaaaaaaaaaaaw!\r\n\r\n                   Heeee! Haaaww!\r\n\r\n                   HE HAAAAW!!!\r\n\r\nThe noise of that terrific bray, as it sounded out, burst forth close by\r\nPat. He was on one side of the partition. The donkey was on the other.\r\nHe was just about seizing the cord so as to give another pull to the\r\ntongue of the bell, when there arose this unexpected, this tremendous\r\ninterruption. Whether Pat had ever heard the bray of a donkey before\r\nmattered not at that moment. He certainly had never before heard a\r\ndonkey, and an injured donkey too, at midnight, in a garret,\r\nclose beside him, pour forth, so suddenly, and so terribly, and so\r\ndeafeningly, such accumulated woes.\r\n\r\nHad a cannon suddenly exploded close by Pat’s elbow, he could not have\r\nbeen more utterly overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nHe sprang back. For a moment he stood paralyzed. Then he jumped at the\r\ndoor. He tore it open. He leaped down the stairs. Bart’s room was at\r\nthe bottom. He opened the door, burst in, and banged it, and locked it\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThen he stood against the door, making the pressure of his back an\r\nadditional barrier against the entrance of any pursuer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_Full, complete, and final Revelation of the Great Garret\r\nMystery.--Confession of Pat--Indignation of Solomon.--His Speech on\r\nthe Occasion.--The Authorities of the School roused.--Pat and the “B. O.\r\nW. C.” are hauled up to give an Account._\r\n\r\n\r\n“HALLO!” cried Bart, who was roused by the noise. “Who’s that out there?\r\nWhat’s the row?”\r\n\r\n“It’s ony me,” said Pat, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n“You, Pat! Is it you? Well, I’d say I’m very glad to see you, only it\r\nhappens to be too dark to see anything. Well, Pat, what’s up?”\r\n\r\nBy this time Bart had got out of bed, and had reached the sitting-room,\r\nwhere Pat was still standing against the door.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t ye hair it?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Hear it? Hear what?”\r\n\r\n“It!” cried Pat. “There’s no mistake this time.”\r\n\r\n“O, come, Pat, none of that nonsense. That does very well for the little\r\nboys; but I understand it all.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t ye hair it?” cried Pat. “It nairly blew me head off, so it did.\r\nAn doun hair I coom wid wan lape, so I did--an it afther me.”\r\n\r\n“It? What It?”\r\n\r\n“Shure you know what.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean that rubbish about a ghost. I know all about that. You\r\nneedn’t talk to me that way.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the distant bray of the donkey sounded once more. Pat\r\nclutched Bart’s arm, and cried,--\r\n\r\n“There it is agin. It’s a coomin. O, I knowed it.”\r\n\r\n“That!” said Bart, opening the door and listening. “Why, that’s only the\r\nbray of a donkey. You’ve heard it often enough---haven’t you?”\r\n\r\n“The bray of a donkey!” faltered Pat. “Sure it’s me that’s heard it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this must be one.”\r\n\r\n“But who ivir heard of a donkey in a garret?”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say he’s strolled up there to visit your friend in the\r\ncupola.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, Bart, not caring to prolong Pat’s terror, explained the cause\r\nof the noise that had terrified him, letting him know at the same time\r\nwhy it was done. He told Pat that they found out about the screech, and\r\nthe bell, and sent up the donkey so as to give him a little taste of\r\nthat fear which he was so anxious to give to others. As they had given\r\nhim a shock, he was satisfied. Had Pat been at all an ill-tempered\r\nfellow; he might have resented all this; but as he was one of the\r\nbest-natured fellows in the world, he showed not the smallest particle\r\nof resentment. On the contrary, the moment the load of horror was lifted\r\noff by Bart’s disclosure, his buoyant spirits rose at once, and all\r\nburst forth to the full swing of his jovial, mirthful, ridiculous,\r\nreckless Irish temperament.\r\n\r\n“Faith, an it’s me that’s caught--’deed an it is so, thin,” he cried,\r\nwith a burst of laughter. “An ye got the donkey up to the garret! Sure\r\nit bates the wurruld, so it does. An didn’t I hair the noise? but how\r\ncud I ivir dhrame it wor that. An ye got him jist close fornist me, so\r\nye did! It wor just in me own air that he hooted, so it wor.”\r\n\r\nPat now grew quite communicative, and told Bart all about it. His motive\r\nfor creating an excitement was simply to get a chance of laughing at\r\nthe other boys, who had so often laughed at him. There was no malice\r\nwhatever in his intention; nothing at all of the nature of vengefulness;\r\nbut simply a mischievous and thoughtless idea of throwing some ridicule\r\non the boys generally. Bart’s discovery of the truth was known to him,\r\nbut he did not care for that; he was determined to keep up his little\r\njoke as long as it could be kept up. He had been startled that night\r\nwhen the string had been jerked from his hand, but afterwards concluded\r\nthat it was the wind. The knock at the doors he explained very simply.\r\nHe had stolen up barefoot, and as the screech sounded, he had struck\r\neach door with a stick, and then ran. He was down below before they\r\ncould see him. All this Pat explained with perfect ease and much\r\nmerriment, regarding it all as a good joke, not even excepting the last\r\naffair with the donkey.\r\n\r\nBut what, it may be asked, was that screech which had been the beginning\r\nof it all?\r\n\r\nIt was all explained on the following morning.\r\n\r\nEarly on that morning the donkey had been brought down stairs with\r\nlittle difficulty, but with an immense amount of noise. As the boys\r\nbrought him out, Pat marched quietly after them, carrying an enormous\r\nOwl!\r\n\r\nOne by one the boys heard the news. The whole school came flocking out\r\nto look upon the objects of their late terror. Gradually the whole story\r\ncame out, and the boys, in their sudden recoil from a general panic,\r\nnow gave way to the wildest uproar and merriment. A laughing procession\r\nfollowed the donkey to his rural home, while Pat took the owl down into\r\nthe kitchen to get some meat for it from Solomon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Solomon had heard of the revelation of the dark mystery, and\r\nwas running out to satisfy himself, when he met Pat half way.\r\n\r\n“O, de sakes, now!” cried old Solomon. “What dis heah scubbry dat hab\r\nturn up on dis smilin an ’spicious morn. Whar’s dat ar an’mal what hab\r\nben kickin up sech a ’menjous bobberation, an ob whose ’sploits I\r\nhab heard so much? Am dis heah de ’sterious an stror’ny phiantium dat\r\nhab frikened dis ’stracted ole nigga man mos to deff?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an here he is,” said Pat, holding forward the bird, “an as fine a\r\nowl as ye’d wish fur till clap yer eyes on, so he is.”\r\n\r\nSolomon stood looking at the owl for a few moments. Then he made a\r\nlow bow, with absurd extravagance of gesture. Then he burst forth in a\r\nstrange tone, which seemed like a desperate attempt at sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Owl, sah,” said he, rolling up his eyes and spreading out his\r\nhands,--“Mas’r Owl, sah, good morn, sah. I’se so drefful glad to see\r\nyou, sah!--such a ’mendious honna, sah!”\r\n\r\nHe then made another low bow, after which he went on with an attempt at\r\nmore scathing sarcasm than ever, in which there was also visible a tinge\r\nof something like indignation.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Owl, sah, ar you awah, sah, dat you hab ben ’ferin berry much\r\nwid de ’pose ob an aged but spectb’l gem’n ob colla, sah? a pus’n,\r\nsah, dat’s bettan a dozen ob you, sah--bein as he is a Granpanderdrum,\r\nan ’sides bein fessa ob de cool and airy ’partment in dis yah\r\n’Cad’my--fessa, sah, ob ebba so many yeahs’ stan’in, sah--fren ob de\r\ndocta, sah, an not a pus’n to be ’posed on, sah? Do you know what you\r\nare, sah? You’re a mis’ble darky, sah--no better’n a crow, sah! Do you\r\nknow what I’m gwino to do, sah, dis bressed moment, sah? I’ve biled\r\nturkeys, an chickens, an geese, an ducks, an pattidges, an quails, an\r\nsnipes, but I hab nebba biled a owl. Wal, dat ar’s jest what I’m a gwine\r\nto do now, sah. Yes, sah, I’m ’termined ’pon dat ar. In you go to de\r\npot, body, bones, an beak--horns, tail, an all, sah.”\r\n\r\n“An what’s the use?” said Pat: “shure he isn’t a poll parrot, that can\r\ntalk back at ye an give ye as gud as he gets. He’s ony an owl, an he\r\ncan’t spake a wurrud, so he can’t.\r\n\r\n“Any how, I’se gwine to bile him dis bressed minit.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, now, be aff wid ye; go long, an don’t be foolin,” cried Pat, as\r\nSolomon made an effort to take the owl; “shure he niver did ye any\r\nharrum at all at all. Shure he’s Misther Slocum’s tame owl, so he is,\r\nthat’s run away, an ben livin in our garret--an I’m takin him back to\r\nhis owner.”\r\n\r\n“Mis’r Sloc’m,” said Solomon. “Well, Mis’r Sloc’m doesn’t lib down\r\nheah--he doesn’t. What you a bringin him heah for?”\r\n\r\n“Sure he ony wants his mate.”\r\n\r\n“His mate,” cried Solomon. “Hab his mate flowed off sides him. Ef I fin\r\ndat ar mate ’bout dese yah primises, I’ll bile her to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, be aff wid ye! Shure it’s ony a paice av mate that I want fur the\r\nowl.”\r\n\r\n“A piece ob meat!” cried Solomon. “Nebba, sah. Dat ar bird hab ’sulted\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nAnd he drew up his aged form with severe dignity.\r\n\r\nBut Pat coaxed and pleaded, and the end of it was, that Solomon was\r\nprevailed on to give him a piece of meat. The owl devoured it greedily,\r\nand then Pat took him away to his owner.\r\n\r\nThe bird, as Pat said, belonged to Mr. Slocum, who lived about two miles\r\naway. He had received him as a very fine specimen of a screech owl, from\r\na sea captain, who had brought him from abroad, and had got tired of\r\nhim. Mr. Slocum happened to be in Halifax at the time, and brought the\r\nbird home in triumph a few weeks before. During the previous week he had\r\nescaped, and had found his way through an open window of the cupola\r\ninto the garret. Pat had discovered him first, and as his terrific hoot\r\nsounded out, frightening the boys, he took advantage of the circumstance\r\nto perform a few additional tricks of his own, with the consequences\r\nthat have been narrated. It was only on the previous day that Pat had\r\nfound out who was the owner of the wandering bird. He happened to\r\nhear people speaking of it in the village store as he was making some\r\npurchases. So, now that the whole affair had come to an end, he thought\r\nhe might as well restore the lively bird to its rightful owner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the donkey had been taken to his pasture, and the boys\r\nreturned, and school began, and the business of the day soon engrossed\r\ntheir whole attention.\r\n\r\nAfter school Pat and the boys of the “B. O. W. C.” received a message\r\nfrom Mr. Long, requesting them to come to his study.\r\n\r\nFor the affair had spread, and the teachers had learned all about it.\r\nOf course it was a thing that could not be passed over. After some\r\ndiscussion, however, it was considered that it was not of sufficient\r\nimportance to be brought before Dr. Porter; and so Mr. Long was\r\nrequested to see all the boys concerned in the affair, and afterwards\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMr. Long’s study was a room situated immediately under Bart’s. He\r\ngenerally left at nine in the evening, and slept elsewhere. Consequently\r\nhe had not been in the way of hearing those “voices of the night.” It\r\nwas to this room, then, that the “B. O. W. C.,” together with Pat, bent\r\ntheir steps, trying to conjecture what Mr. Long proposed to do about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n_Called to Account.--Mr. Long and the B. O. W. C.--They get a tremendous\r\n“Wigging.”--Pat to the Rescue.--Mr. Long relaxes.--The unhidden\r\nGuest.--Captain Corhet and the irrepressible Bobby.--Coming in Joy to\r\ndepart in Tears.--The Relics again.--A Solemn Ceremony.--A Speech, a\r\nPoem, a Procession, all ending in a Consignment of the exhumed Treasure\r\nto its Resting-place._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS they entered the study they found Mr. Long seated in an arm-chair by\r\nhis study table. He looked at them with a grave and severe countenance,\r\nand motioned them to seats.\r\n\r\nThey sat down.\r\n\r\n“_Boys_,” said Mr. Long, in a cold and constrained voice, “None of you\r\nwill accuse me of ever interfering with legitimate sport, or will think\r\nthat I am destitute of sympathy with boyish ways and manners. I think\r\nyou know me well enough to believe that I take a deep interest in\r\neverything that can make you enjoy yourselves here; that I want you to\r\nlove this place with all your hearts, and through all your after\r\nlives to look back upon Grand Pré Academy with the most affectionate\r\nrecollection. That very feeling I have now, and it is this that animates\r\nme while I call upon you to give an account of those disturbances in\r\nwhich you have been engaged.\r\n\r\n“You see a line must be drawn somewhere,” he continued. “Your affair at\r\nthe French cellar was not altogether what it ought to have been, and I\r\ndo not approve of it at all. Apart from the lateness of the hour, there\r\nwas about the whole transaction an air of wildness--a certain headlong\r\nrecklessness of sport, which I should rather check than indulge. Still,\r\nI have nothing to say about that now. You seem to have gone into that\r\naffair with an impetuosity of pure fun, that blinded you to anything\r\nobjectionable which might have been in it. Besides, you have already\r\ntold all about that, and in a whimsical way that disarmed all reproof.\r\n\r\n“But, boys,” resumed Mr. Long, in a severer tone, “this last affair has\r\nbeen really a serious offence against discipline. The school has been\r\ndisturbed, it seems, for many nights. There have been all kinds of\r\nnoises; howlings, yellings, and screechings, of all sorts; rappings and\r\nknockings. Now, all these things may be very funny to the contrivers of\r\nthem, but you are surely old enough to know that they may be excessively\r\ndangerous to sensitive minds. Did you not think of the poor little\r\nfellows here who might receive a serious mental shock from such\r\ndisturbances? Is it possible that you could have been blind to all\r\nthings except your own selfish amusement? Is this the sort of thing that\r\nis becoming to you--you,” he repeated, “from whom I hoped nothing but\r\nexamples of manliness, and generosity, and frankness, and chivalry? I\r\nwill not believe that it is possible for you to fail in these qualities.\r\nI trust rather to what I _know_ of you, and I will attribute all this to\r\nnothing except utter thoughtlessness on your part. And it is that very\r\nthoughtlessness, if nothing worse, that I blame. It was not worthy of\r\nyou; it was utterly beneath you. It was a very serious offence.”\r\n\r\nThe boys fairly writhed under all this, and Bart, with his face flushing\r\nscarlet, and his eyes gleaming with excited feeling, was about to speak;\r\nbut Mr. Long commanded silence with his uplifted hand.\r\n\r\n“But what shall I say,” he continued, “to this last business? Here\r\neverything reaches a climax. Not satisfied with having thrown the whole\r\nschool into a panic, and with making the garret seem a haunted place\r\nto most of the boys,--a place, in fact, into which none dared to go but\r\nyourselves,--not satisfied with all this, you determined upon an act\r\nwhich is sufficient to demand serious punishment. Having already raised\r\nan almost intolerable terror in the school, you deliberately proceed to\r\nintensify even this, and raise that terror into a perfect anguish. Was\r\nnot the panic sufficient already? Did you wish it to terminate in some\r\ntragedy? Would it have been satisfactory to you if the feeble brain of\r\nsome of the younger boys had given way under this new terror? if some\r\none of them had suddenly gone mad, as that abhorrent roar, that mixture\r\nof howls, and yells, and screeches, and hoots, rising up into an\r\nunearthly din, and intermingled with the awful toll of the bell, had\r\nburst upon his ear? Such things have happened. There have been, not\r\nboys, but men, who have gone mad from things even less terrible than\r\nthese. Why, when I think of what might have happened, I shudder, and I\r\nstand amazed at what I charitably consider your thoughtlessness; though\r\nfor such thoughtlessness as this, what punishment can be adequate?\r\n\r\n“And now,” he concluded, “what have you to say for yourselves?”\r\n\r\nAll this time the faces of the boys were like fire, and writhing in\r\nindignation, they looked back at Mr. Long as he hurled against them what\r\nthey felt to be unmerited accusations. They had only been concerned\r\nin the last affair for the purpose of putting an effectual end to the\r\nother. But as they sat there in the consciousness of innocence, they saw\r\nthat it was impossible for them to explain it. They could not tell what\r\nthey knew, for that would be to accuse Pat.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Long,” burst forth Bart, starting up, with his face in a flame, and\r\nhis voice trembling with indignation, “every word that you have uttered\r\nis utterly and totally undeserved by us. I assure you most solemnly that\r\nwe have never violated any principles of honor or of chivalry. You do\r\nnot know the facts, sir, or you would never have uttered those bitter\r\nwords. You have done us great wrong, sir; we are not deserving of such\r\ncharges as these. We are innocent; but we are not in a position to\r\nexplain.”\r\n\r\nBart paused for a moment, and in that momentary pause another voice\r\nburst in as eagerly and as impetuously as his own.\r\n\r\nIt was Pat.\r\n\r\nHe had started to his feet just as Bart did, but Bart had spoken before\r\nhim. As soon as he could get a chance he burst in.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Long,” he cries, “it’s all a mishtake what yer sayin. As thrue as\r\nI’m standin here,--and I’m tellin no lie, so I ain’t,--it was me that\r\ndid it, so it was. And they knowed it was me, so they did. And it was\r\nonly to play a little harrumless joke that I did it. I didn’t bring the\r\nowl there at all, at all. He coom there himself. He howled, an the ony\r\nblame to me wor, that I didn’t tell what I knowed. Besides, I thried\r\ntill alarrum the boys a bit. Nivir fear that wan av thim same goes mad.\r\nThey indured the excitemint, so they did. Afther a day or two, I tied a\r\nsthring till the bell-knocker, an give it a bit av a pull, an I knocked\r\nat the Raw-dons’ dure and at Jiggins’. An I’m the ony wan to blame; an\r\nif there’s till be any punishin a goin; I’m the wan that’s going till\r\ntake it, so I am.”\r\n\r\nAll these words Pat poured forth with feverish impetuosity, as though\r\nanxious to tell everything before he could be interrupted. Not a\r\nword did he say about the other boys and the donkey. He left it to be\r\ninferred that he was to be blamed for the donkey also. He intended--the\r\nwarm-hearted Irish lad--that he should be punished for that too.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Long,” cried Bart, bursting in, “since Pat has told about the owl\r\nhimself, we can confess our share. We brought up the donkey.”\r\n\r\n“An it worn’t a thrick,” said Pat. “It wor till frighten me, so it wor,\r\nan make me stop me bell-pullins an knockins. That’s what it wor. An\r\ndidn’t I get it! I wor jest pullin the sthring that wor fastened till\r\nthe bell, whin the donkey let aff a bray that knocked me clain from me\r\noun room all the way down stairs, head over heels, an fut first. That’s\r\nwhat it did. An that’s as thrue as I’m standin here a tellin av it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long now began to question them, and soon all the facts were\r\nelicited. As the truth became known, the severity of his manner relaxed,\r\nand his tone became pleasant and kindly.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he, “all this puts the matter in a very different\r\nlight. The owl came and screeched himself. Pat was only to blame for\r\nassisting the excitement. You were only to blame for taking so very\r\nviolent a way to stop the affair. It might have been stopped without\r\nthat, if you had simply told all about it. But I see the odd kind of\r\nmotive you had. You merely wished to surround the denouement, as you\r\nsay, with such absurd accompaniments, that no boy on the hill would ever\r\ndare to hint at a ghost again. Well, I may not like your way of going to\r\nwork, but I at least understand your motives. I need not say how glad I\r\nam at this explanation. I came here under a false impression, and regret\r\nthat I spoke with such severity. The only thing that I blame about this\r\nis, that it was what is called a practical joke, both on Pat’s part\r\nand on yours; and that is a thing which I have always endeavored to put\r\ndown. So now, boys,” he concluded, “let me say--”\r\n\r\nAt this moment there came a faint rap at the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked at the door, but took no further notice of the sound.\r\nThinking it was a mistake, he continued, in a pleasant tone,--\r\n\r\n“Let me say, boys, that I have such confidence in all of you, that I\r\nfeel sure--”\r\n\r\nAt this there came another rap, somewhat louder. “Come in,” said Mr.\r\nLong.\r\n\r\nThe door opened slowly. Those in the room were behind it as it opened,\r\nand they could not see who was coming. Gradually it opened, and then\r\nthere stepped forth the venerable form of Captain Corbet. He carried in\r\nhis arms a little bundle, which he held with the tenderest care; and\r\nthere was on his face an expression made up of pride, of triumph, and of\r\na certain joyous consciousness which he possessed that he was the bearer\r\nof that which would not fail to excite similar emotions in others.\r\n\r\nThe moment Mr. Long saw him and his burden, he started to his feet,\r\nlooking very pale.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood in the doorway, swaying his shoulders backward and\r\nforward, so as to afford an agreeable motion to his tender charge; his\r\nhead hung on one side, and he looked upon the company with that peculiar\r\nexpression of benignity which may be seen on the face of some indulgent\r\nfather who has prepared some rich treat for his children.\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed the venerable Corbet; “all here--all jined together on\r\nthis momentuous occasion! An me afeared that some on yew’d miss it! Wal,\r\nit air lucky--ain’t it? You see, the ole woman, she went off to see a\r\ncousin of hern, that’s got her youngest darter down with the spotted\r\nfever,--ony I dare say, arter all, it’s ony the measles. So I see\r\nthis here young an tender infant, a kerowin in his keradle like all\r\npossessed; an I says, Now’s the perpitious momunt; an I says to the\r\noffsperin, ‘Doozy wanter see Missr Long, den? Doozy wanter see zee boys?\r\nAn so he sall!’ Fur, my Christian friens, I promised you, solemn, on\r\nthat thar vyge; that some day I’d bring the babby. An you, sir, Mr.\r\nLong, my benefactor, I vowed to you that sence you’d saved this tender\r\nbabe from rewination arter his feyther’s laid low, he should come an\r\nshow you his own self, and look up in your keountenance, through his\r\nblue orbs, and smile upon you with his be-yeau-teefulest smile! An thar\r\nhe air.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Captain Corbet proceeded to remove the coverings from the\r\nface of his beloved burden.\r\n\r\nMr. Long stood motionless and mute. His eyes wandered to the window.\r\nCaptain Corbet was standing in the doorway, barring the passage, and\r\nslowly and tenderly drawing aside the veil that hid from view the face\r\nthat he loved.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Long started.\r\n\r\nHis resolution was taken.\r\n\r\nHe walked towards the door.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet saw him not. His eyes, his thoughts, and his heart were\r\nall engaged in his delightful employment.\r\n\r\n“Ah, captain,” said Mr. Long, hurriedly, “I hope you’re very well. Is\r\nthere anything I can do for you? If so, I can see you some other time.\r\nI’m in a great hurry. I’ve just finished some business which I had with\r\nthese boys. You will have to be kind enough to excuse me.”\r\n\r\nHe touched Captain Corbet’s shoulder, and tried to push him gently\r\naside, so as to pass.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet’s hand, which had been removing the coverings, fell\r\nslowly to his side. His face turned up and confronted Mr. Long’s with\r\nan expression of utter bewilderment, as though the language which he\r\nhad heard was perfectly incomprehensible. His lips moved, but no sound\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to excuse me,” said Mr. Long, kindly. “I’m in a great\r\nhurry. Will you allow me to pass?”\r\n\r\nMechanically Captain Corbet moved to one side. Mr. Long hurried out.\r\nHe descended the stairs; he walked rapidly out of the Academy, and down\r\ninto the village, and far, far away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood at the doorway looking at vacancy. At length he\r\nturned. There was a certain blank amazement in his face, as though he\r\ncould not yet understand what had happened.\r\n\r\n“He said he was in a hurry!” he murmured. “He’s gone! actilly--an\r\nraelly--and terewly--gone--an _sech_ a chance! Why, it’ll-never come\r\nagin, may be. An he’s ben an missed it--lost it--? actilly therrown it\r\naway! Boys,” he continued, after a pause, in a hollow voice, “am I a\r\ndereamin?”\r\n\r\n“O, no, captain,” said Bart, cheerily. “You’re wide awake. Come in and\r\nsit down.”\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Pinch me!” said he, in the same tragic tone.\r\n\r\nNo one obeyed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet heaved a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he. “I feel that I’m awake. Here’s the babby--here’s its\r\nparient. But I must rest, an meditate over this harrowin occurrience.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he walked forward, and seated himself in Mr. Long’s vacated\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n“Thar,” he exclaimed, after a long silence, raising his meek face, and\r\nsolemnly regarding the boys. “Thar, it air over! That dream hath past\r\nand fled, an the feeble idee I ben a hevin of Mr. Long’s better natoor\r\nair totially overtherrown by that muve! For it was a perroud hope of the\r\naged and tew sangu-wine Corbet to give thanks to the man that delivered\r\nhim from rewination in the most ef-fectooil way, by a bringin of the\r\nbabby face tew face with his benefacture, an a teachin of the tender\r\ninfant to summile on the author of his footur fortin. We met,” he\r\ncontinued, as a darker shade came over his venerable countenance. “We\r\nmet, an I thot we’d feel a mootooil jy. I stood a lingerin long by\r\nyonder open portial, a holdin of him in suspense, an a pictoorin tew\r\nmyself his silent raptoor. Why, do you know, boys, I’d even made up\r\nmy mind to _let him hold the babby_,--jest for a leetle,--if he begged\r\nhard, an if the infant didn’t cry. That’s what I was a keepin in store\r\nfor him. What do ye think of that now?”\r\n\r\nAnd after this announcement of his late plan, he looked earnestly at the\r\nboys to witness the full effect of that disclosure.\r\n\r\n“An what was the result? Did he spering tew meet me? Did he clasp the\r\nbabe? Did he evince a mite of yearnin or kimpassion? Did he even try to\r\nget a sight of the pootiest little face zat ever was--bress him.” Here\r\nCaptain Corbet began to show signs of growing maudlin, but he checked\r\nhimself and went on. “He! not he. What did he do, young sirs? You saw\r\nhim. Bar witness tew what I say. He took his departoor. He felled, like\r\nan evil sperrit, at the approach of that cherub. An I--I felt it sore--I\r\nfelt it--an I feel it still,--yes, I do,--yea, even down to the toes of\r\nmy butes!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0299]\r\n\r\nHere followed a long silence, which the boys did not break, for they\r\ndid not know what to say to soothe the woes of the afflicted captain. At\r\nlength he looked up, and went on in a tone of sadness, in which might be\r\ndetected something like resentment.\r\n\r\n“Fust opinions is alius krect. You mind, boys, what I told you on the\r\nbriny deep. I said that the heart of Mr. Long was as hard as the neither\r\nmilestone. Terew, when, on that eventfooil trile, he riz up for me, an\r\nfit down my fiendish prosecooter, an gently tetched him up on the\r\nroar by that tremenjuous outbust abeout the babby; when all that was a\r\nhappenin, I did think I’d a leetle mis-jedged him. But did I? No. I come\r\nto show a parient’s gratitood by presentin before him my most perecious\r\ntreasoor. An what was the result? What? Why, he met me with his\r\nhabitooil hardheartedness. I found him stiff as a marbial statoot, cold\r\nan freezin as a icicle, rugged an onfeelin as a rocky precipious!”\r\n\r\nAs he ended, he rose from his chair. The boys now gathered about him,\r\nand asked him to come up to Bart’s room, just overhead, and let them see\r\nhis infant. They addressed consoling words to him, and sought to smooth\r\ndown his ruffled feelings.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No, boys,” said he, “thankee kindly. You’re all right,--’tain’t you,\r\n’tain’t your fault,--but I feel sore. There’s somethin opperessive in\r\nthis here intellectooil atmosphiour. I must seek elsewhere for comfort\r\nto my ruffled busom. Thankee kindly, boys. Some other time, not\r\nnow--some other time.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the aged captain left the room, and descended the stairs,\r\nand took his departure. The boys watched his venerable figure till it\r\npaased out of sight; and the slow pace, and bent head, and mournful\r\nmood of their beloved navigator touched all their hearts with a common\r\nfeeling of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAs Captain Corbet’s retreating figure disappeared from view, the boys\r\nturned away, and walked slowly along the front of the Academy, with a\r\nvague idea of taking a walk up to the camp. But before they had gone any\r\ngreat distance they met Dr. Porter.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, “you’ll be glad to know that your French relics are all\r\nlabelled, and are now ready to be taken to the Museum.”\r\n\r\n“May we take them there, sir?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Now, if you like. I’ll go back to the house, and let you have them.”\r\n\r\nSaying this the doctor turned back towards the house, followed by the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThey found the articles all neatly labelled, and their names written\r\nupon each label as discoverers and donors. All looked delighted except\r\nBart. He read the label on the bone, and there was an expression on his\r\nface which did not escape the notice of the doctor.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Bart?” he asked. “You don’t seem pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” said Bart, “I didn’t think that this bone belonged to--to\r\n_that_.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what did you think that it did belong to?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I thought that it belonged to the owner of the house.”\r\n\r\n“The owner of the house!” said the doctor, with a laugh. “Well, not\r\ndirectly. It belonged to his horse, as I think, but Mr. Simmons thinks\r\nit was his cow. That is the only way in which it ever belonged to him.”\r\n\r\nBart looked ineffably disgusted.\r\n\r\n“Then it’s no use putting an old cow bone in the Museum,” said he.\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” said the doctor. “It was found beside the plough, and perhaps\r\nbelonged to the horse or ox that dragged it. From that point of view it\r\nis a very interesting relic.”\r\n\r\nBart said no more, and soon the boys retired on their way to the Museum,\r\nbearing their treasures with them.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said Bruce, “it will never do for us to carry these things up\r\nwithout making some demonstration or other. It isn’t every day that we\r\nare presenting things to the Museum that we’ve dug out of the ground.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a capital idea,” cried Bart, who by this time had recovered from\r\nthe shock of his disappointment.\r\n\r\n“So I say,” said Arthur; “but what shall we do?”\r\n\r\n“O, let’s have a speech, and a poem, and a procession,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tom, “Bruce can make the speech, and Bart can make the\r\npoem.”\r\n\r\nThis was agreed upon, and it was decided that the ceremony should come\r\noff immediately before tea-time. They had an hour yet, and that gave\r\nthem ample time. Soon the news spread abroad, and all the boys flocked\r\nto the spot. Bruce ascended the portico, and stood there with the French\r\nrelics at his feet.\r\n\r\nBruce had not had much time for preparation; but then he was very quick\r\nat impromptu speeches, and the occasion did not demand anything more\r\nthan this. Bart stood near, scribbling something in his memorandum-book.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging the things in an effective row, and putting all the\r\ncoins inside the iron pot, Bruce commenced.\r\n\r\nHolding up the iron pot, and rattling the coins, he began by giving a\r\nhumorous description of their search after it. Without going very deeply\r\ninto the real particulars of the case, he introduced into his burlesque\r\nnarrative quite a number of the actual facts. After finishing this\r\ndescription, he showed the identical pot of money which they had\r\nexhumed, and it was passed round from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nBruce then exhibited the ploughshare, and the other irons. The plough,\r\nhe assured them, belonged to the first settler on this classic spot. The\r\nbolts had fastened it together, and the chain had drawn it through the\r\nground. It was this plough, of which these were the interesting relics,\r\nthat had reclaimed the hill from its original wilderness state, and made\r\npossible the existence of that great and glorious school to which they\r\nat present had the proud privilege of belonging.\r\n\r\nFinally, he exhibited the bone. Dr. Porter, he said, thought it was the\r\nbone of a horse; while Mr. Simmons thought that it once had belonged to\r\na cow, or perhaps an ox. For his part, he had a theory of his own. He\r\nthought that it was the bone of that nightmare that had been making such\r\na disturbance among them during the last week. That bone was now going\r\ninto the Museum, and he was confident that the peculiar animal to which\r\nit belonged would never trouble the school again.\r\n\r\nAs Bruce ended, he was greeted with three cheers. Three more followed\r\nfor the plough; three for the pot of money; and three for the bone.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Bart arose with his memorandum-book, in which he had been\r\ndiligently scribbling.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “after the able, polished, elegant, eloquent,\r\nornate, and thoroughly exhaustive address from my learned friend, who\r\nhas just sat down, it would be quite out of my power to say anything.\r\nBesides, I’m appointed to give the poem. The subject is connected with\r\none of the articles before us. I mean the bone. Dr. Porter has one\r\ntheory; Mr. Simmons another; my learned friend has a third. For my part,\r\nI have my own theory, which I adopted at the moment of its discovery,\r\nand which I still maintain. This, gentlemen, is the subject of my poem.”\r\n\r\nAfter which Bart read the following from his memorandum-book:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE THEORY OF THE BONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “O, I’m the bone of a Parley Yoo\r\n\r\n                        That settled in Minas Bay,\r\n\r\n                   That dammed the marshes, and cleared the woods,\r\n\r\n                        And called the place Grand Pré.\r\n\r\n                   “And the grain it riz, and the settlement growed,\r\n\r\n                        And werry content were we,\r\n\r\n                   With our cattle and pigs, and bosses and gigs,\r\n\r\n                        And beautiful scenerie.\r\n\r\n                   “And there it was nothing but Nong-tong-paw,\r\n\r\n                        Et cetera, from morning to night,\r\n\r\n                   And Mercy, madame, and Wee, moo-soo,--\r\n\r\n                        We were all so werry polite.\r\n\r\n                   “But the Britishers came, and druv us off;\r\n\r\n                             So I took to my heels, and ran,\r\n\r\n                   And one of them chased me, and quick I went\r\n\r\n                        For rather an elderly man.\r\n\r\n                   “And he had a gun, and I had none;\r\n\r\n                        And he fired that gun at me;\r\n\r\n                   And he shot my leg, and off it dropped,\r\n\r\n                        Which was rather a bother, you see.\r\n\r\n                   “But I seized my leg, and I hopped away,\r\n\r\n                        As quick as quick could be,\r\n\r\n                   And the Britisher loaded his gun agin,\r\n\r\n                        For another shot at me.\r\n\r\n                   “But I dodged the Britisher in the woods,\r\n\r\n                        And took the leg that was shot,\r\n\r\n                   And buried it under the apple tree,\r\n\r\n                        In this werry identical spot.\r\n\r\n                   “And I’m the werry identical bone\r\n\r\n                        Of the leg of the Parley Yoo\r\n\r\n                   That was buried beneath the apple tree,\r\n\r\n                        And dug up again by you!”\r\n\r\nThis closed the proceedings.\r\n\r\nA procession was then formed, headed by the “B. O. W. C.,” who led the\r\nway to the Museum.\r\n\r\nThere they deposited the exhumed Acadian relics; and, if they haven’t\r\nbeen taken away, they’re lying there still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_The Boys in the Museum.--The Doctor’s Lecture.--The\r\nAcadians.--Louisbourg.--A Journey to the Wharf.--The Antelope.--Captain\r\nPratt._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE presence of Dr. Porter in the Museum repressed to some extent the\r\nmerriment of the boys, and the newly-arrived articles were deposited in\r\na conspicuous place, where they could not fail to attract attention. The\r\nMuseum had grown up slowly under the joint care of the doctor and Mr.\r\nSimmons, the former of whom devoted himself to the archæological, and\r\nthe latter to the mineralogical department. With each of these gentlemen\r\nit was a hobby. The delight of the doctor at these exhumed French relics\r\nhas already been described; and, at the present time, their formal\r\nassignment to their proper location here served to stimulate his\r\nenthusiasm, and started him off upon a favorite theme of his--the exiled\r\nAcadians. About these he had much to say. He showed all the relics which\r\nhe had slowly accumulated here; he told many stories of discoveries of\r\nhis own; and finally, going to a small chest, he drew forth some papers.\r\n\r\n“I promised to show you some of these,” said he, “when we were over on\r\nthe North Mountain. Everything in the banishment of the Acadians was\r\nhard and harsh, and cannot be thought of now without indignation. Not\r\nthe least repulsive thing about this business is the way in which they\r\nwere sent off. Many people suppose that they were sent away in the large\r\nships of the British fleet. That was not the case. They were packed in\r\na number of small vessels hired at Boston; most of them were schooners.\r\nThe whole thing was taken under contract by a Boston firm--Messrs.\r\nAp-thorp & Hancock. All their bills which they sent in to the Nova\r\nScotia government are now in the archives, and I have copies of them.\r\nSee; here is one for a specimen.”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed the following, which the boys passed from hand to hand:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0312]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0313]\r\n\r\n“Ah, boys,” said the doctor, mournfully, “how much of human anguish may\r\nwe read there! how many broken hearts! how much despair appears before\r\nus in those remorseless figures! Think of the name of Hancock being\r\nassociated with a thing like that. “Neutralls” they were--two hundred\r\nand thirty “neutralls” at so much per head. Perhaps among those poor\r\nexiles, contracted for at so much per head by that Boston firm, there\r\nwas some Evangeline looking over the sea, with her white lips and her\r\neyes of despair.\r\n\r\n“Still,” continued the doctor, after some silence, “the English didn’t\r\nhave it all their own way. There were several occasions in which the\r\nAca-dians were able to baffle them. One place was at the head of the Bay\r\nof Fundy, the River Pelilcodiac. Here the French were in league with the\r\nIndians, as indeed they were throughout the whole of Canada and Acadie;\r\nand when a detachment of troops was sent there to capture them, they\r\nretreated to the woods. The troops made a descent at one place, where\r\nthey found twenty-five women and children. These they were merciless\r\nenough to make prisoners. Then they went through the country devastating\r\nit, and seeking thus to ruin the poor fugitives. It was villanous work.\r\nThey burned more than two hundred and fifty houses and a church. At last\r\nthe French made an attack on them, and they were forced to retreat. Had\r\nthe French shown a little more enterprise, they could have destroyed\r\nthem; as it was, the troops got off without much loss. There was another\r\ninstance when the French got the better of their enemies. It was a\r\nvessel that was carrying over two hundred of them from Annapolis to\r\nCarolina. The French rose, and got command of the vessel, and put into\r\nthe River St. John. The English heard of it, and sent a vessel after\r\nthem with British soldiers disguised as French. But the fugitives\r\ndiscovered the trick, and not being able to cope with their enemies,\r\nthey set fire to the vessel, and escaped to the woods.\r\n\r\n“There was a great deal of abominable cruelty in different parts.\r\nWherever they could not make prisoners, they burned their houses, in the\r\nhope of starving them to death. Whole districts were thus devastated.\r\nThe descendants of these peopie remember all this yet, and can tell many\r\na tale of misery. Many of the exiles gradually worked their way back,\r\nand found new homes for themselves in other parts of the country, and\r\ntheir descendants are scattered all about the coasts of Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick. They are curiously like their ancestors. Simple,\r\ninnocent, joyous, peaceful, there is but little crime among them;\r\nand though they are not so progressive as we are, yet they have other\r\nqualities which may compensate for the absence of our more practical\r\nfaculties. They are certainly very stationary; so much so, indeed, that\r\nsome acute observers declare that they have not advanced so much as\r\ntheir kindred in France. They say that our Aca-dians are more like the\r\nFrench peasantry of a hundred years ago than the French themselves are\r\nat the present day. This is particularly the case in the more remote\r\ndistricts, such as the Bay de Chaleur. I have often been there myself,\r\nand every time I visit one of their villages in that district, I recall\r\nsome of the descriptions of the Grand Pré Acadians in Longfellow’s\r\nEvangeline.”\r\n\r\nHere the doctor began to tell some anecdotes, and then went on speaking\r\nof other things, until at length he stopped in front of a rusty\r\ncannonball, which lay on a table in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said he, “is something which I received a few days ago, and I\r\nthink it is almost equal to the Acadian plough.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a cannon-ball from Louisbourg; and though I don’t know, of course,\r\nfor certain, yet I have made up my mind that it is a relic of the first\r\nsiege.”\r\n\r\n“How can you tell, sir,” asked Bruce, “whether it is the first siege or\r\nthe second.”\r\n\r\n“O, for that matter, I can’t tell at all very clearly; only the spot\r\nwhere this was found makes it more likely to have been fired at the\r\nfirst than the second. Besides, the first siege is far more interesting\r\nto us, since it was the act of British Provincials, and an exploit quite\r\nunparalleled in its way.”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, I always thought that the second siege was one of the\r\ngreatest achievements in war. Were there any generals in the first equal\r\nto Wolfe, or any other men equal to Boscawen, and Rodney, and Amherst?”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you put it in that way,” replied the doctor. “No; in the first\r\nexpedition there are no names so brilliant as these. Pepperell was a\r\nmerchant, and a colonel in the militia. Whether that makes his exploit\r\nthe more glorious or not, I leave you to judge. But this much is true,\r\nthat about the first siege there was a reckless dash, and gallantry, and\r\nromantic heroism which we cannot find in the second. Mind you, it was\r\nall the work of a lot of farmers, fresh from the plough, raw militia,\r\nand how they could get such a plan into their heads I cannot imagine,\r\nI have often thought that it was their very ignorance that emboldened\r\nthem. It was principally the work of Massachusetts, though the other New\r\nEngland Provinces took some share in it. The idea was started there, and\r\nthe governor took it up very earnestly. So they raised four thousand men\r\nand a fleet of thirteen vessels, which was a wonderful thing to be done\r\nby so thinly peopled and so young a community. At first they intended to\r\nhave the cooperation of the British fleet, but the commodore declined;\r\nand it was only after he had sailed to Boston under orders from the\r\nBritish government, and found the New England expedition gone, that he\r\nfollowed them, and so took part in it; for Governor Shirley and the New\r\nEngland militiamen resolved to go on, whether the commodore helped them\r\nor not; and so they did go on. But it was all right in the end, for the\r\nBritish fleet came up with them, and they went on in company to their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n“They landed at Gabarus Bay, south of Louis-bourg, and behind the town.\r\nIt was the thirtieth of April, very early in the season, cold and foggy.\r\nThe French were there already to dispute the landing, but they outwitted\r\nthem most dexterously. It was cold, and boisterous, and foggy, as I have\r\nsaid, and never did any men have harder work in getting their arms and\r\nstores on shore; but all this was accomplished at last. The next day,\r\nMajor Vaughn, with four hundred men, went past the city up to the\r\nharbor, and set on fire some warehouses. They made a great smoke, and\r\nthe soldiers in the Royal Battery, one of the chief works, spiked the\r\nguns, and fled in a panic. On the following day, Vaughn, with thirteen\r\nmen, came near the fort, and, as it seemed to be deserted, they advanced\r\ncautiously, and finally entered it. They hadn’t any flag; so one of\r\nthe soldiers climbed the flag-staff with his red coat in his teeth, and\r\nnailed this to the staff as a flag. Vaughn then sent word to General\r\nPepperell, ‘May it please your honor to be informed that, by the grace\r\nof God and the courage of thirteen men, I entered the Royal Battery\r\nabout nine o’clock, and am waiting for reenforcements.’ But before\r\nreenforcements could come, the French at Louisbourg had seen them, and\r\nsent a hundred men in boats to regain possession. Vaughn and his men,\r\nhowever, were ready for them, and the little band gave them so warm a\r\nreception, that they actually drove them back, and held possession till\r\nreënforcements came. Then the Royal Battery’s guns were remounted, some\r\nnew ones brought, and all these were turned upon the city, and this\r\nbattery did not a little towards the final capture.\r\n\r\n“It strikes me that this was an uncommonly plucky thing to do,”\r\n continued the doctor, “and this incident is but one among many. The\r\nwhole siege is full of such exploits. The character of the besieging\r\narmy was odd in the extreme. The lads worked like oxen at their duties,\r\ntoiling away in the surf, and in the swamp, and in the woods, and yet at\r\nthe same time presenting an appearance of disorder that was shocking to\r\nthe martinets who were present. In front they fought like tigers, but in\r\nthe rear each man did what seemed right in his own eyes. In front there\r\nwas bombarding; in the rear frolicking, racing, wrestling, and pitching\r\nquoits, running after the shot from the fortress, so as to get the\r\nbounty that was offered. These honest lads knew nothing at all about\r\nengineering, or regular approaches. The engineers who were present spoke\r\nof parallels and zigzags; but the militiamen laughed at what they called\r\ntheir outlandish gibberish, and made their approaches to the enemy in\r\ntheir own homespun way. How do you think they contrived to do it? Why,\r\nby making a bold advance by night, and throwing up an earthwork, and\r\nintrenching themselves before morning. In this way they continued their\r\nadvance, to the utter confusion of the professional engineers. The\r\nfact is, the audacity of pure courage meets with astonishing successes.\r\n_L’audace, l’audace toujours l’audace_, is a French saying, which was\r\nexemplified before the eyes of Frenchmen throughout all this first\r\nsiege. The commandant at Louisbourg thought there was an army of\r\nthirteen thousand men besieging him, and all the time the army amounted\r\nto less than four thousand farmers.\r\n\r\n“And so the men carried on their siege, with their valor and their\r\nlaughter, their heroism and their sport, their sufferings and their\r\nmirth; fighting in front, frolicking in the rear; enjoying life\r\nlike boys, but facing death like men. And that was the way they took\r\nLouisbourg. When the gallant fellows marched into the stronghold which\r\nthey had captured, then first they seemed to have an adequate idea of\r\ntheir undertaking. They looked around upon the formidable batteries,\r\nthe granite walls, the intricate gate-ways, and the mighty ramparts, and\r\nwere half appalled at the immensity of their success. And, indeed, the\r\nsuccess may well be called immense. It was a wonderful thing, when we\r\nthink who it was that achieved it. The success is all the more striking\r\nwhen we consider the vast preparations that were made for the second\r\nsiege. That second siege does not seem to me to be at all equal to the\r\nfirst in point of romantic interest; and then again, the fact that there\r\nwas a second siege is of itself a. stigma on the British government, for\r\nso readily giving back to the French what had been so gallantly won. The\r\nblood of those brave fellows had all been shed in vain; the work had all\r\nto be done over again, and more blood had to be shed before that mistake\r\ncould be rectified. But when that mistake was rectified, and Louisbourg\r\nwas taken a second time, there was a very different minister at the head\r\nof affairs; the struggle with the French was begun on a gigantic scale,\r\nand did not end until the French power on this continent had been\r\ncrushed under the ruins of Quebec.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the doctor ended his remarks; and as it was now late,\r\nthe boys all retired to their respective rooms, where they passed the\r\nremainder of the evening in study.\r\n\r\nIt usually takes several days for boys to settle down fairly to school\r\nwork at the beginning of any new term; and so, after this vacation, it\r\nwas some time before the school work could be fairly grappled with. The\r\nremembrance of the events of the past days was strong in the minds of\r\nall, and for a time prevented that application which was desirable. A\r\nstronger effort than usual was required in order to force the mind to\r\nits task, and a longer time was needed in order to master that task.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the school had recommenced, the boys of the B.\r\nO. W. C. were discussing the important question of the disposal of their\r\ntime for that afternoon. School was already over. The other boys had\r\nscattered in different directions; some to the dike lands, some to the\r\nfields, and some to the woods.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go, boys?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“To the woods,” said Phil,\r\n\r\n“To Gaspereaux,’ said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“A game of cricket,’ said Tom.\r\n\r\n“No, boys,” said Bruce; “let’s go down and see what’s become of the old\r\nAntelope.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the idea,” said Bart, “the glorious old Antelope. Let’s have one\r\nlast look at her. By this time, perhaps, she is half covered with mud.\r\nIt was a soft place, I think, where she was lying, and she will soon be\r\nburied out of sight; so let’s have one final look at her before we lose\r\nsight of her forever.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal was in the highest degree satisfactory to the other boys,\r\nand soon they started down the road to the place where the Antelope\r\nlay. On reaching the place, they found that it was high tide, and the\r\nill-fated schooner lay in the same place where they had seen her last,\r\nfar over on her side, with her masts pointing downward. The tide had\r\nrisen so high that it covered more than half of her, leaving only part\r\nvisible. The upper parts of her masts also were covered. At such a\r\nmelancholy spectacle the boys stood for some time in solemn silence.\r\nAnother schooner lay not far away, at a wharf, but they felt no\r\ncuriosity about her. All their thoughts were taken up with the Antelope.\r\n\r\n“And so this is the end of her,’ said Bruce, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“_Hic jacet_, as Captain Corbet said,’ remarked Phil.\r\n\r\n“Who would have thought that her end was so near?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And think,” said Tom, “of the old craft, after escaping so many\r\nperils, meeting her fate here at her own wharf.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the old saying realized,” said Bart,--“the sailor shipwrecked\r\nwithin sight of home.”\r\n\r\n“But I say, Bart, she doesn’t seem to have sunk any deeper in the\r\nmud--does she?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart. “I expected by this time that she would be as deep as\r\nthat in mud, not in water.”\r\n\r\n“She’s afloat,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“No, she isn’t; she doesn’t move,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“No; she’s perfectly steady, and fixed in the mud,” said Bart. “There’s\r\nno floating, about her.”\r\n\r\n“She’ll break up soon, I suppose,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know,” said Bart. “If she were exposed to a heavy sea she\r\nwould; but here in this quiet harbor she will either sink altogether in\r\nthe mud, or else lie rotting away for years, a mournful and melancholy\r\nspectacle.”\r\n\r\nWhile the boys were looking thus sadly upon the schooner, a man emerged\r\nfrom the cabin of the other vessel at the wharf, and going ashore,\r\nproceeded as though on his way to the village. The boys did not notice\r\nthis man till he was close to them, and then there was a shout of joyful\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n“Captain Pratt!”\r\n\r\nYes, that stout, bluff, red-faced, jovial captain stood there before\r\ntheir eyes, evincing as much pleasure at the sight of them, as they did\r\nat the sight of him. He wrung their hands heartily all round, laughing\r\nall the time, and asking them how they got home, and whether they ran\r\nashore more than a dozen times in doing so.\r\n\r\n“I come here,” said he, “arter taters. I got a tater freight to Boston,\r\nand I’m goin to fill up right straight off. And it’s right glad I am to\r\nsee you all again. I thought mebbe I’d see some of you over here, and\r\ncome here instead of goin to another place where I could have got a\r\nbetter freight.”\r\n\r\nThe captain was very voluble, very noisy, and very jolly. He made\r\nall the boys come on board his vessel, and give an account of their\r\nadventures after leaving him. They did so, and he listened with deep\r\nattention, varied from time to time by peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said he at last, “I’m a goin right straight off to Boston\r\nas soon as I get my cargo in. Ain’t there any of you that wants to go?\r\nI’ll take any of you, or all of you. Come now.”\r\n\r\nThe boys thanked him, but excused themselves, and explained that they\r\ncouldn’t go very easily, as the school had now begun, and they were all\r\nhard at work at their studies.\r\n\r\n“Sorry for that,” said Captain Pratt. “I’m too late, I see. Perhaps I’ll\r\nhave another chance with you. At any rate, I’ll promise you a better\r\nvessel than the one you had on your cruise. Of all the old tubs--But\r\nwhere is she now. Has Corbet got a tater freight?”\r\n\r\nAt this question the boys said nothing, but looked silently and with\r\nmelancholy glances over the stern to where the form of the Antelope was\r\nhalf visible above the water. Captain Pratt saw their glances.\r\n\r\n“What craft’s that there?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Bart, “is the gallant craft that you just asked about--the\r\none that we had in our cruise--the Antelope.”\r\n\r\n“That!” cried Captain Pratt; and starting up, he walked astern, and took\r\na long look at the schooner. The boys followed him. They said nothing,\r\nbut looked at the Antelope along with Captain Pratt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Inspection of the Schooner.--Captain Pratt to the Rescue.--His Engines\r\nand his Industry.--Up she rises!--Who’ll go for Captain Corbet?_\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN Pratt was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, at last, “whar’s Corbet?”\r\n\r\n“He’s home.”\r\n\r\n“Home? Why don’t he do something?”\r\n\r\n“Why, what can he do?”\r\n\r\n“Do? Everything.”\r\n\r\n“He says the schooner’s lost.”\r\n\r\n“Lost!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say so himself?”\r\n\r\n“He said the schooner was ‘a gone sucker.’ Those were his own words.”\r\n\r\n“And didn’t he try to do anything?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What--didn’t even try?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I declare! I never did think that Corbet had much brains; but this\r\nbeats everything. To go and let his schooner go to destruction in this\r\nway, and not even try to save her, is a little beyond what I expected\r\neven of _him_. But how did it happen?”\r\n\r\nThe boys told him.\r\n\r\n“And so,” said Captain Pratt, “he came here next day, and found the\r\nschooner lying here, and did nothing--jest sot down and lamented over\r\nher. Why, what’s the man made of? He’s about the only man I ever heard\r\nof that could sit still and see his property perish.”\r\n\r\n“But all the people in the village thought it was lost.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. If he said so, they believed him. If he did nothing, why\r\nshould they try to do anything? If a man won’t help himself, you don’t\r\nsuppose other people’s goin to help him--do you?”\r\n\r\n“And do you think, after all, that she could have been saved?”\r\n\r\n“Course she could.”\r\n\r\n“And she wasn’t lost?”\r\n\r\n“Course she wasn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Could she be saved now?”\r\n\r\n“Course she can.”\r\n\r\n“What! and she isn’t lost, after all?”\r\n\r\n“Course she isn’t.”\r\n\r\nAt this astounding intelligence the boys looked at one another in silent\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“Why, look here,” said Captain Pratt; “what happened to that there\r\nschooner often happens to others. It’s a mighty unpleasant thing to\r\nhappen; but schooners do get over it, after all. I’ve helped friends\r\nout of similar scrapes, and have sot several schooners right side up\r\nin worse places than this.. There’s nothing so very bad about this. The\r\nposition is a good one for working in, too; and the mud here isn’t so\r\nsoft as it is in other places around here by a long chalk. But whatever\r\ngot into Corbet’s head I can’t imagine. It beats me.”\r\n\r\n“Can you really save her then, after all--you yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Course I can--only not single-handed. I’d want some help.”\r\n\r\n“And _will_ you?”\r\n\r\n“Course I will, with the above proviso. Captain Pratt’s a man that’s\r\nalways ready to help a neighbor, and though this here neighbor doesn’t\r\nseem altogether inclined to help himself, yet I’m ready to do what I\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nAt the generous offer of Captain Pratt the joy of the boys was\r\ninexpressible. They at once poured forth a torrent of questions as to\r\nwhen he could begin his work, and where, and how, and what they could do\r\nto help him, and whether they could do anything at all; which questions\r\nbeing all asked at once could not be immediately answered.\r\n\r\n“You see, boys,” said Captain Pratt, “I’ll need some help.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll do what we can.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. I’ll have to rely on you. I’ve only got two men in the\r\nschooner, and we can’t do all. If you know any men about the village,\r\nsend them or bring them along. Send for Corbet, too.”\r\n\r\n“O, we want to have it all done without Captain Corbet knowing anything\r\nabout it till it’s all over.”\r\n\r\n“Why not let him come, and take his share in the work?”\r\n\r\n“O, it would be better fun to get him down here, and let him see his\r\nvessel afloat.”\r\n\r\n“Fun, you call it! Wal, I won’t dispute about words. At any rate, it\r\nought to teach him a lesson.”\r\n\r\n“But when can we begin?--now?”\r\n\r\n“Now?” replied Captain Pratt, with a smile. “Wal--hardly--not just now,\r\nI should say. You see the vessel’s partly in the mud, and a good deal in\r\nthe water, and it would be rather difficult to get at her so as to go to\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“How long will it be before we can begin?”\r\n\r\n“Not till the tide leaves her.”\r\n\r\n“That will be after dark.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, this evening; but to-morrow morning the tide will be out, and\r\neverything can be done then.”\r\n\r\n“But then we shall be in school.”\r\n\r\n“So you will. Well, it’ll have to be managed without you. But, after\r\nall, you won’t be wanted till the evening. My men and I can do all the\r\nfixins. We’ll get everything ready when the tide is out, and then in the\r\nevening, when you come, you will be able to help without getting up to\r\nyour eyes in mud.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, we’ll all be down.”\r\n\r\n“How many can you muster? A dozen boys like you will be enough.”\r\n\r\n“O, we can muster more than that, if you wish it. We will bring down the\r\nwhole school.”\r\n\r\n“All right then. You see it will be about eight men’s work. I and my\r\nmen make three, and you lads ought to make up the rest. It’ll be mostly\r\npullin that you’ll be wanted for.”\r\n\r\n“Pulling?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--histin. I’ll rig some tackle for you. Besides, I’ll have to get\r\nthe vessel clear of mud at low tide. There can’t be much in her here.”\r\n\r\n“Why, we thought, from what Captain Corbet said, that by this time she\r\nwould be sunk so deep that she would be half buried in the mud, and half\r\nfull of it.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! The mud just here on this slope isn’t very deep. Six or eight\r\ninches of mud is about all she’d sink in. Two or three hours’ work will\r\nclear all that away, and then all that is left for us to do is to get\r\nher right side up, and I’ll rig the tackle for that.”\r\n\r\n“I must say, Captain Pratt,” said Bart, “it’s un commonly good in you to\r\ntake so much time and trouble.”\r\n\r\n“O, as for that,” said Captain Pratt, “neighbors must be neighborly, and\r\nseafarin men most so. Besides, I hain’t got anything in particular to\r\ndo to-morrow, and I’d like very well to turn a hand to this. But I\r\ndon’t see yet why Corbet should go and be such a precious old goose. The\r\nvessel ain’t worth much, but she’s worth settin right side up; that I’ll\r\nmaintain.”\r\n\r\nThe captain then proceeded to explain his plan of action to the boys\r\nmore minutely, so that at last they perceived how very simple and\r\nfeasible it was, and wondered now that Captain Corbet should have given\r\nup his vessel so readily, without making any effort, where an effort\r\nwould have been so very easy.\r\n\r\n“I understand now, I think,” said Bart, “why Captain Corbet gave up\r\nthe vessel. It was the babby. He wanted to be able to devote himself\r\naltogether to his domestic cares.”\r\n\r\nAfter spending some further time the boys took their departure, with\r\nthe understanding that they were to return on the following day after\r\nschool, with all the boys that they could muster.\r\n\r\nBy seven o’clock on the following morning, Captain Pratt was at work\r\nat the Antelope. The tide had retreated far enough to allow of an\r\ninvestigation of her condition, though the water which had filled her at\r\nthe last tide had not run out of her. His first work was to bore a few\r\nauger holes along the lower part of her deck, to let all the water run\r\nout. The Antelope was not, after all, so very deep in the mud as had\r\nbeen supposed by the boys. It had covered her taffrail some inches, but\r\nthis could be shovelled away without any very severe exertion; and\r\nit was to this that Captain Pratt and his men first directed their\r\nenergies. Two hours’ work sufficed for them to clear away all this,\r\nafter which they turned their attention to other things. First of all,\r\nas the water had now run out, Captain Pratt stopped up the auger holes\r\ntightly, and then prepared to close the hatchways. This was a work\r\nof extreme difficulty. The hatches which belonged to the schooner had\r\nfloated away long ago, and it was necessary to make new ones. This\r\nwas at length done by working up some stuff that was on board Captain\r\nPratt’s vessel, which they then proceeded to fasten to the hatchways of\r\nthe Antelope. The position in which the schooner lay made it excessively\r\ndifficult. She was on her side on a slope in such a way that her deck\r\noverhung them somewhat as they worked, so that they labored at a\r\ngreat disadvantage; however, they persevered, and at length had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that the new hatches were fastened in with\r\nsufficient firmness to suit their purposes, and were judged to be\r\nsufficiently water-tight for the present emergency.\r\n\r\nThe work thus far, important though it was, had been essentially\r\npreliminary; and now the machinery had to be arranged for the immediate\r\nwork of raising the fallen vessel to her proper position. Captain Pratt\r\nand his men took a number of spars from their schooner, and selecting\r\nthree of them, bound their ends together, and stood these three like a\r\ntripod, as near to the schooner as possible, and close by the foremast.\r\nThree more bound together in a similar way were placed near the\r\nmainmast. From the top of each of these a tackle-block was suspended,\r\nand a line also was passed from each, and run around a tree which stood\r\nabout a dozen yards away from the edge of the bank. Another line\r\npassed from each tackle-block, and was fastened around each mast of the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt’s design was now evident.\r\n\r\nFirst of all he had cleared away the mud that had covered the taffrail\r\nof the schooner, and emptied her of water; then he had battened down the\r\nhatches so that at the next rising tide no water should enter her; and\r\nfinally he had rigged the tackle-blocks so as to hoist up the schooner\r\nto an erect position by means of the united efforts of all that could be\r\nmustered. But the schooner, as she now lay, could not be raised by such\r\nmeans. It was necessary to have additional help, and that help was to\r\nbe found in the rising tide. When the water should rise so as to be deep\r\nenough for the schooner to float in, the task of pulling her up to an\r\nerect position would be comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt’s labors were energetically performed, and finally, just\r\nas he had completed his tackle arrangements, the tide began to flow\r\naround the schooner.\r\n\r\nIn another hour the water was high around her; still another, and\r\nthe tide was at its fullest height, and Captain Pratt began to look\r\nanxiously for the boys.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys on the hill had all heard of the proposed enterprise,\r\nand, from the largest to the smallest, were filled with intense\r\nexcitement. They chafed impatiently against the restraints of the\r\nschool, and waited with extreme difficulty for the closing hour. At\r\nlast it came; and then, with loud shouts, and screams, and laughter,\r\nthe whole school set off at a run for the scene of action, which they\r\nreached just as Captain Pratt began to feel impatient.\r\n\r\n“Hooray!” shouted the gallant captain, as he saw them pouring down\r\ntowards the wharf. “Here you are,--and lots of you, too. You’re just in\r\ntime, too. The tide’s up, the tackle is rigged, and all we’ve got to do\r\nnow is to go to work.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked hastily around, and though they could not see all that\r\nhad been done, yet they could comprehend the purpose of the tackle which\r\nthey saw before them, and had no doubt whatever that the undertaking\r\nwould be perfectly successful.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys,” said Captain Pratt, “you can’t all bear a hand, but you\r\nsmall boys’ll have to be satisfied with lookin on. I’ll choose the\r\nbiggest to help me, and show you where you’ve got to pull.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he selected from among the boys: Bruce, Arthur, Bart, Tom,\r\nPhil, Jiggins, Muckle, Sammy Ram Ram, Johnny Blue, Billymack, Bogud,\r\nand Pat, and these he stationed at the tackle which was attached to the\r\nforemast, while he himself and his two men went to the lines which were\r\nattached to the mainmast.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys,” said he, “it’s no use to pull every which way. Pull\r\ntogether as I give the word. Mind--it’s a long pull, a strong pull, and\r\na pull all together. I’ll sing, and you pull at the chorus---that’s the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Captain Pratt burst forth with a rude song, which was,\r\n\r\n                        “Up she rises;\r\n\r\n                             Hi ho, cheerly, men!\r\n\r\n                        Heave her up;\r\n\r\n                             Hi ho, cheerly, men!\r\n\r\n                        All together;\r\n\r\n                             Hi ho, cheerly, men!\r\n\r\n                        Heave with a will;\r\n\r\n                             Hi ho, cheerly, men!”\r\n\r\nAnd at every cry, “Hi ho, cheerly, men,” Captain Pratt and his men gave\r\na pull, and the boys, watching him, pulled also. At first they were a\r\nlittle irregular, but they soon caught the time, and pulled as regularly\r\nas the men. And thus, with a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull\r\nall together, they sought to raise up the fallen schooner.\r\n\r\nThe schooner felt it. Already the mud had been detached from its grasp,\r\nand the water which flowed around formed an additional assistant,\r\nbuoying it up, and supporting it as they pulled. The clinging mud\r\nwas the only thing to contend with. The first pull loosened its hold\r\nsomewhat, the second and third did this still more, and finally the\r\nfourth raised the masts above the surface of the water. Again and again\r\nthey pulled, and higher and higher came the masts, until at last, when\r\nhigh up in the air, all further pulling was rendered unnecessary by\r\nthe schooner, which threw herself upon her keel in the water, and thus\r\nrighted herself of her own accord. She did not sit very fair, it is\r\ntrue, for the mud which had accumulated on one side of her hold gave\r\nher a lop-sided appearance; but that mattered little to the boys. It was\r\nenough triumph to them that she was afloat, and so they celebrated their\r\ntriumph in long, loud cheers.\r\n\r\nHaving thus righted the schooner, Captain Pratt prepared to secure her\r\nin a proper manner.\r\n\r\n“We’ve righted her, boys,” said he, “and now let’s take care that she\r\nshan’t be wronged.”\r\n\r\nWith this end in view, lines were fastened from the schooner to the\r\nshore, and Captain Pratt finally pronounced her free from danger.\r\n\r\nThe boys now crowded around the Antelope to see what marks she bore\r\nof her late calamities. There she floated before them, her masts and\r\nrigging plastered with mud, yet afloat, and able once more to plough\r\nthe seas after her own fashion. A few among them managed to scramble\r\non board, the righted schooner. The scene around was not particularly\r\nattractive. The mud still clung close to the deck and rigging, and even\r\nCaptain Pratt’s work around the hatches was already coated over with\r\nthick slime. The scene was not an attractive one, and they did not\r\nremain there long.\r\n\r\n“She wants cleanin,” remarked Captain Pratt, after a long\r\nsurvey,--“that’s a fact; an what’s more, she wants corkin--no\r\ndoubt,--an a good coat o’ tar. She wants new spars, an riggin, an\r\nchains, an anchors,--a new deck, too, and pumps wouldn’t be out of the\r\nway; and for that matter, while they were about it, they might as well\r\nput a new hull onto her. By that time she’d be fit to carry taters, and\r\nCorbet might make a little money out of her. But it would cost a\r\ngood bit to do all that, and so I dar say Corbet’ll sail her as she\r\nstands,--if he sails her at all. Arter all, he might as well, bein as\r\nshe’s jest as good now as ever she was. She never was much; but then\r\nshe’s been lucky, and did well enough for Corbet. It would be kind of\r\nonnateral to see him aboard of any other craft than this here.”\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said Bart, “something ought to be done in honor of this great\r\noccasion; and above all, we ought to make up some way to bring Corbet\r\nface to face with his restored Antelope. Shall we tell him at once, and\r\nlet him come down?”\r\n\r\n“No, let’s leave it till he finds out. Let’s give him a shock of\r\nsurprise.”\r\n\r\n“But how will we know anything about his surprise, unless we are here on\r\nthe spot at that great meeting between Corbet and his lost but restored\r\nschooner?”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll have to manage it so as to be here when he comes down to see\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to arrange some plan.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we let him know what has happened, or get him to come down here\r\nfor something else?”\r\n\r\n“O, we ought to get him to come for something else, and then his\r\nsurprise will be all the greater.”\r\n\r\n“But what else?”\r\n\r\n“That we’ll have to think over.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to make haste about it, then.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we ought to decide before the end of the week.”\r\n\r\n“The end of the week! Nonsense! Why not to-day?”\r\n\r\n“To-day?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. Now’s the time. We must get him down to-day, while we’re all\r\nhere. If we don’t, he’ll be certain to hear all about it before tomorrow\r\nfrom some one else.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“To-day’s the time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to-day. We’re all here. I want to see the meeting. I wouldn’t lose\r\nthe sight for anything.”\r\n\r\n“Well--what shall we get up to bring him here?”\r\n\r\n“O, let’s send word that Captain Pratt wants to see him on very\r\nparticular business.”\r\n\r\n“That won’t bring him, especially if he’s got the babby. He wouldn’t\r\ncome down before when the business was still more important.”\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t send some word about a potato freight, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“No, for three reasons; first, because it isn’t the truth; secondly,\r\nbecause he believes that he has no schooner; and thirdly, because he is\r\nindifferent to potato freights.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what shall we tell him, then?”\r\n\r\nThis conversation went on, every one speaking at once; but no one being\r\nable to think of any plausible message to send to Captain Corbet which\r\nshould be true, and at the same time not disclose the actual facts. At\r\nlast they concluded that it was impossible to make up such a message;\r\nand as the time was passing, they determined to send for him at all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\nBut who would go?\r\n\r\nPat at once offered, much to the relief of all the others, who wanted\r\nto be on the spot when Captain Corbet arrived. Pat, however, was very\r\ngood-natured, and didn’t at all mind the long walk, but promised to be\r\nback in an hour, along with Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell him about the schooner, unless you have to,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Sure an what’ll I tell him, thin?”\r\n\r\n“O, tell him anything at all, so long as it’s the truth, and no humbug,\r\nyou know. Just tell him in a general way something or other.”\r\n\r\n“Somethin or other in a gineral way?” repeated Pat.\r\n\r\n“Yes, something that’ll make him come down, you know; and don’t tell him\r\nabout the schooner, unless you have to.”\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an I won’t. I’ll tell him somethin in gineral, an nothin in\r\nparticular.”\r\n\r\n“But no humbug, you know.”\r\n\r\n“No--surely not; it’s mesilf that won’t.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words Pat took himself off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Argument between Pat and Captain Corbet.--Meeting between Captain\r\nCorbet and the Antelope.--Pat alone with the Baby.--Corbet becomes an\r\nExile, and vanishes into a Fog Bank._\r\n\r\n\r\nPAT walked briskly, and in due time arrived at Captain Corbet’s house.\r\nHe knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said a voice.\r\n\r\nHe entered, and found himself face to face with the one whom he wished\r\nto see. The aged navigator was seated near a cradle, gently tilting\r\nthe rocker with his foot, and thus giving to it an easy and agreeable\r\nmotion. There was a smile of peace on Corbet’s mild countenance, which\r\ndeepened into a smile of welcome as he recognized Pat.\r\n\r\n“Why, how d’ye dew?” he exclaimed. “Railly, I’m delighted to see you.\r\nTake a cheer.”\r\n\r\n“Thank ye, kindly,” said Pat; “but it’s a hurry I’m in, and I’ve jist\r\nbrought a message for you from the b’ys.”\r\n\r\n“The boys?”\r\n\r\n“Yis. They want you at the wharf.”\r\n\r\n“Me?”\r\n\r\n“Yis; it’s dyin to see you they are.”\r\n\r\n“The boys--dyin to see me at the wharf?” repeated Captain Corbet,\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n“It’s that same they are doin, and they sint me to bring you down.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, that’s a pity, now,” said Captain Corbet. “I’m railly pained. I\r\nwish I could go. But you see the old ’oman’s out; gone to see a nevey of\r\nhern that’s jest took down with the influenzy, an I’m alone, an’ got\r\nto take car’ of the babby.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sure now an ye must go,” said Pat, entreatingly. “Look at me; sure\r\nan didn’t I run all the way up from the wharf for ye.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, railly now, I’d do anythin to oblige the boys, but you see thar’s\r\nthe babby, a delicate creatur, an’ the old ’oman away. But what do the\r\nboys want to see me for?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an it’s for matthers av the greatest importance intoirely, so it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“But thar’s no use for me to go down, I tell you. You go down, and get\r\nthem to come up.”\r\n\r\n“Och, sure an the businiss won’t allow thim to come up at all, at all.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, it will. ’Tain’t likely they have anything so dreadful\r\nimportant but what some of them can come here.”\r\n\r\n“But I tell ye this businiss must be transacted on the wharf,” said Pat,\r\nearnestly. “It’s on the wharf it must be done, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“The wharf? I don’t see that exactly. What is the business?”\r\n\r\n“Why, why--it’s--it’s a kind av a--a--tis-timonial, sure; an there you\r\nhave it.”\r\n\r\n“A testimonial?--railly--wal, now, that’s rail kind. But couldn’t the\r\nboys come up here--or postpone it?”\r\n\r\n“Sorra a bit of that same culd they do,” said Pat. “It’s all got to be\r\ndone on the wharf, and this evenin so it has.”\r\n\r\n“On the wharf?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it’s jist that same, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“An this evenin?”\r\n\r\n“Sorra a time else.”\r\n\r\n“What kin it be?” said Captain Corbet, meditatively, lost in wonder at\r\nthe mystery that surrounded Pat’s message. He leaned his head upon his\r\nhand, while his foot still jogged the cradle, and sat for a time lost in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBut Pat’s impatience could not endure the delay.\r\n\r\n“O, come along,” said he; “sure it’s all one to you.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t,” said the captain. “You forget the babby.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what to do,” said Pat, as a bright thought struck him;\r\n“bring the baby wid you.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stared for a moment at Pat in silent horror.\r\n\r\n“What!” he cried, “bring _him_ with me! Expose that per-recious head to\r\nthe evenin damp! Why, d’ye think I’m made of _iron?_”\r\n\r\nPat at this gave up, and began to despair of moving Corbet from his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“If ye o’ny knowed,” said he, at last, resuming his effort,--“if ye o’ny\r\nknowed what it was, ye’d go fast enough.”\r\n\r\n“Knowed what it was? Why, didn’t you say what it was?”\r\n\r\n“Not me, sure.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you did.”\r\n\r\n“Niver a bit of it.”\r\n\r\n“You said it was a testimonial.”\r\n\r\n“Well, an did I tell you what kind of a testimonial it wor? Not me.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, tell me now.”\r\n\r\n“Will ye go if I do?”\r\n\r\n“How can I go?”\r\n\r\n“Take the baby along wid ye, sure. It’s aisy enough.”\r\n\r\n“That thar’s not possible. I’ll tell you. Wait, and p’aps the ole\r\n’oman ’ll be hum soon.”\r\n\r\n“Wait? But we can’t wait. It must be done the night.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, the businiss.”\r\n\r\n“The testimonial? Why can’t it be kept?”\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s a kind av a present; something that ye’ll value next to\r\nyer child, so ye will.”\r\n\r\n“Dew tell. Wal, now, railly; why, what upon airth _kin_ that be?” said\r\nCaptain Corbet, whose curiosity began to be more excited than it had\r\nhitherto been.\r\n\r\n“I’m not allowed to tell,” said Pat, mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“Why, railly! Why, how extra particular! But come now, tell a leetle of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said Pat; “but if you want to know, ye must go to the wharf.”\r\n\r\n“Somethin,” mused Captain Corbet. “Somethin you say that I’ll vally nex\r\nto my babby. Why, what upon airth _kin_ it be? I declare I never was so\r\ncur’ous in my hull life; an you wun’t tell.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“Wun’t?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Honor bright?”\r\n\r\n“Honor bright.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, what _kin_ I dew?” cried Captain Corbet. “I can’t leave the\r\ninfant’s bedside. I couldn’t take ten steps away, and leave him here.\r\nWhat _kin_ I do?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” cried Pat, at last, after some silence, and with an air\r\nof desperate determination. “I’ll stay wid him, and you go down.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ stay?”\r\n\r\n“Yis, mesilf. He’s asleep. He won’t wake. I’ll rock him. It’ll be all\r\nright. And you hurry down, an hurry back.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked a long time in doubt at Pat, meditating over this\r\nsingular proposal.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, at last, “railly--it’s desput kind in you--but--a\r\nfeyther’s feelins--air desput delicate things--but as you say--he’s\r\nasleep--bress his pooty face!--an he’ll stay asleep--and you’ll rock\r\nhim--an watch over his infant slumbers. And I’m desput cur’ous--and\r\nso--why, railly, I declar’ ef I hain’t got half a mind to go--jest to\r\nplease the boys.”\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Pat, earnestly; “an make haste about it, too, for they’re\r\ndyin wid impatience, so they are.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet gave an uneasy glance all around.\r\n\r\n“Ah, come now, hurry up,” urged Pat, “an don’t be all night about it.”\r\n\r\n“I feel dreadful oneasy,” said Captain Corbet, “about’ what I’m agoin\r\nfor to do.”\r\n\r\n“Onaisy, is it? Nonsense! Won’t I be here? Am I a Injin?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be kerful then--will ye?” said Captain Corbet, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Sure an I will.”\r\n\r\n“An watch him?”\r\n\r\n“Av coorse. But sure an he’s sleepin like a lamb; he’ll need no care or\r\nwatchin.”\r\n\r\n“An you think I railly may ventoor, jest to please the boys.”\r\n\r\n“O, yis, av coorse; on’y don’t wait any longer.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet drew a deep breath, as though to summon up all his\r\nfortitude for the ordeal before him.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” he said, “I will. I’ll make the plunge. But be kerful; watch. An\r\nof he stirs, rock him; an ef he stirs more, rock him harder; but ef he\r\nstirs more, so as to be likely to wake, you must sing to him; an ef he\r\nactilly doos wake, then you’ll have to take him up and nuss him. Ef\r\nhe still con-tennoos to wail,”--and here the captain’s voice\r\nfaltered,--“you must walk up and down with him; ef he don’t stop then,\r\nsing and play with the furnitoor; and finally, ef nothin else’ll quiet\r\nhim, thar’s his bowl an his bessed supper on the table, an you must feed\r\nhim. But how can I bar to leave him, and trust all this to you--?”\r\n\r\n“O, nonsense!” cried Pat; “sure an he won’t wake at all, at all; an if\r\nhe does, I’ll do everythin that you say, an more by the same token.”\r\n\r\n“You will?”\r\n\r\n“Av coorse.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think I may ventoor,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Do, an be quick. Ah, now, none of that,” cried Pat, as the fond father\r\nstooped over the cradle of his infant. “Sure ye’ll wake him, so ye will.\r\nHurry off.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I was just goin to kiss him--but p’aps I’d better not,--so I’ll\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words Captain Corbet tore himself away from the cradle,\r\nand left the house.\r\n\r\nHe walked with rapid strides, yet his breast was a prey to contending\r\nfeelings. On the one hand, he was exceedingly curious to know what it\r\nwas that the boys had for him, and he was also anxious to gratify them;\r\nbut then, on the other hand, he was disturbed about his baby, and\r\nfull of fear lest some evil might befall him during his absence. His\r\nprogress, which at first was rapid, soon slackened, and then grew\r\nslower, and finally stopped altogether. He turned irresolutely, and\r\nlooked back. But all was still. This encouraged him to resume his\r\njourney. Again and again he turned and looked back, and each time he was\r\nreassured. At last he descended the hill, and his home could no longer\r\nbe seen. Even then he stopped, and looked back several times, as though\r\nhe expected that a cry from his deserted infant might meet his ears.\r\nBut no cry came, and he went on. At length he came to the village, and\r\nfinding himself thus far committed to his journey, he concluded that\r\nit would be better to make haste, so as to be back as soon as possible.\r\nWith this resolve he set off at a run, and soon reached the wharf.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he made his appearance when a wild cheer arose. At first\r\nthe captain could see nothing but a crowd of boys, who gathered round\r\nhim, shouting and cheering. Partly inquisitive and partly bewildered,\r\nhe looked from one to the other with inquiring yet puzzled glances,\r\nand said not a word. But the boys did not keep him long in suspense.\r\nThronging around him, they took his arms, and half led, half urged him\r\nonward to the river bank, where full before him floated the Antelope.\r\nEven then, perhaps, Captain Corbet might not have noticed the schooner,\r\nhad it not been for the cries and gestures of the boys.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this sudden and unexpected sight, as he realized its\r\nmeaning, was overwhelming. He started, he stared, he rubbed his eyes,\r\nhe looked at the boys, then at the Antelope, then at the boys again, and\r\nthen once more at the Antelope. He could not speak a word. He stared in\r\nutter amazement. His belief in her complete and hopeless loss had been\r\nperfect; and now to see her floating before him was an overwhelming\r\nsight that deprived him of the power of speech. His emotion was so\r\ngreat that his aged form trembled visibly. He burst into tears; and then\r\nturning towards the boys without speaking a word, he went around among\r\nthem, shaking hands with every one of them most earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Thar,” said he, at last, as he drew a long breath, “I don’t think I\r\never in all my born days saw a day like this here. An who did it? Did\r\nyouns do it all--every bit?”\r\n\r\n“We did some of it,” said Bart; “but it was Captain Pratt that did the\r\nmost of it. If it hadn’t been for him, it couldn’t have been done at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Pratt? Bless his benevolent sperrit; Take me to him. Whar is\r\nhe? I want to thank him.”\r\n\r\n“O, he’s up in the village somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“An so this was the occasion you wanted me for? Wal, railly. And here’s\r\nthe Antelope--an here am I gazing upon her well-remembered form!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet spoke these words meditatively, and then made an effort\r\nto climb on board. This he soon succeeded in doing. Thereupon he feasted\r\nhis eyes upon the schooner, examining her in every part.\r\n\r\n“Muddy,” said he, solemnly. “Muddy, yet lively, and fit for more vyges,\r\nso soon as you get rigged up and repaired.”\r\n\r\n“Boys,” he continued, after a long silence, standing on the deck of the\r\nAntelope, and addressing his young friends,--“boys, you onman me, an the\r\naged Corbet relapses intew a kine o’ second childhood, for I hed given\r\nher up for lost. I hed seen in her ruination a warnin to me that I was\r\nto desert forevermore the rolling ocean, and confind myself to hum. But\r\nthis here day an hour shows me that I have vyges yet in store, an my\r\nfeelins now are ony purest jy. For the Antelope bore me o’er the briny\r\ndeep for over twenty year, in sickness and health, with taters, an I\r\nalways counted on our livin an dyin together. Her loss, when I thought\r\nher lost, was terewly a sunderation of my heartstrings. I felt her dume\r\nwas mine. But now I see her raised up out of her muddy bed of mortial\r\nillness, an brought up, and set right side up, to walk the waters like\r\na creetur of life, with taters. Boys, emotion overcomes me. Boys, adoo!\r\nBoys, other feelins swell within my busum. Boys, thar is one at home\r\nthat demands my return,--one known to most of ye,--about whom I feel\r\ndreadful anxious, bein as I’ve ben and left him in onexperienced hands,\r\nan me not knowin but he’s cryin his perecious eyes out this moment.\r\nBoys, adoo! You have a parient’s gratitood!”\r\n\r\nWith these words the venerable Corbet left the schooner, and after\r\nshaking hands with a few of them, hurried home as fast as he could,\r\nwhile the boys, feeling now that their work was at length complete,\r\nreturned to the school.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pat had been left alone with the baby.\r\n\r\nPat knew nothing whatever about the care of babies, and had volunteered\r\nthe charge of this one out of the kindness of his heart, never supposing\r\nthat he would be called on to display any of the qualities of a\r\nnurse. In this, as in many other cases, ignorance made him rash in his\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nFor about half an hour all went on well; and Pat, after jogging the\r\ncradle for a little while, grew tired, and amused himself with looking\r\naround the room.\r\n\r\nBut from these pursuits he was roused by a movement on the part of the\r\nbaby. Back, then, he darted to the cradle, with a vague fear that the\r\nbaby would wake, and began rocking it vigorously. But such very vigorous\r\ntreatment as this, instead of lulling the wakeful infant back again to\r\nthe land of sleep, only roused him the more.\r\n\r\nPat, therefore, cherishing in his memory all of Captain Corbet’s\r\ndirections, did as he had been ordered, and rocked the cradle harder.\r\n\r\nBut the baby only grew wider awake, and began to murmur and fret.\r\n\r\n“Woroo!--this’ll niver do, at all, at all,” said Pat. “He towld me to\r\nsing if it grew worse,--so sing it is, and here goes.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pat began a wild, shrill, crooning chant, about some personage\r\nnamed Biddy Malone, whose eventful history, however, he was not able to\r\ncomplete, for the baby, waking wide up, began to cry very vociferously.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s all up wid me!” said Pat. “What-iver I’ll do not a one\r\nof me knows, at all, at all. He said if he got worse to take him up. I\r\ndon’t know about it,--but--how and iver, here goes.” So stooping down,\r\nwith the best intentions in the world, Pat took the baby up in his arms,\r\nand put it on his knee, in the hope that this plan might succeed in\r\nsending it off to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t succeed any better than the other plans, for whether the\r\nbaby was fastidious and didn’t like Pat’s treatment, or whether Pat\r\nhandled him too roughly, or whether he was hungry and wanted food, or\r\nill and wanted nursing,--whichever of these it was,--certain it is that\r\nthe moment Pat took him up he sent forth a cry that struck terror to\r\nPat’s soul, and made the welkin ring.\r\n\r\n“Och, murther! murther!” said Pat. “What iver’ll I do at all wid it? An\r\nme to be here for more than two good hours! Whis-s-sh, then, I tell ye!\r\nArrah, will ye niver be quiet? What’ll I do at all, at all. Sure an he\r\nsaid to walk about wid it. That same I’ll do this minute.”\r\n\r\nSo Pat rose from the chair and proceeded to walk about the room. But the\r\nnew treatment did no good. On the contrary, the baby cried harder.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that Pat’s handling was rougher than what the baby\r\nhad been accustomed to, and that Pat’s patience being quite exhausted,\r\nprevented any gentleness in his treatment of his ten--der charge. And so\r\nit was that the baby bawled, and Pat groaned, and was completely at his\r\nwit’s end.\r\n\r\n“Och, but it’s nearly dead an kilt I am,” cried Pat, at last. “What was\r\nit that he said to do next? He said to sing, and knock the furniture\r\nabout, so he did. It’s the racket that’ll soothe him,--deed an it\r\nis,--and that’s what I’ll thry.”\r\n\r\nWith this Pat began another song, a little livelier than the last; and\r\nwalking about the room, he began to knock upon the furniture. He upset\r\ntwo chairs, he beat upon a tin pan, he rapped the poker against the\r\nstove-pipe, he rattled the leaf of the table, he kicked over a small\r\ntable and several stools, he rolled tin kettles about the floor, until\r\nat last the room presented an appearance that made it seem as if a mad\r\nbull had been there kicking indiscriminately. But notwithstanding Pat’s\r\nefforts, he could not succeed. The baby, who at first had been silent\r\nfor a few moments, perhaps from astonishment, now began louder, wilder,\r\nand more passionate cries, till the noise from those small lungs drowned\r\nthe uproar that Pat was making.\r\n\r\n“Och, murther!” cried Pat, at last. “Sure it’s bothered I am, and dead\r\nbate intirely. Whativer I’ll do now it ud take more’n me to tell. Sure\r\nan I’ve made all the noise I know. What’ll I do now? There’s the feed;\r\nhe said so, he did, an I’ll thry it.”\r\n\r\nIt was Pat’s last resort, and he tried it. The bowl was there where\r\nCaptain Corbet had pointed it out. Pat seized it, and taking the spoon,\r\noffered it to the baby. But the baby treated his offer with scorn. He\r\nopened his mouth indeed, but it was only to let forth a yell so loud,\r\nso long, and withal so passionate, that the spoon fell from Pat’s hands\r\nupon the floor, while the bowl which he had been trying to balance on\r\nhis knee, followed with a crash.\r\n\r\nPat jumped up, still holding the baby, and walked wildly about, singing\r\nat the top of his voice, and renewing the useless racket. He went to\r\nthe door and looked wildly down the road, hoping to see some signs of\r\nCaptain Corbet, though time had not yet elapsed sufficient for him to\r\nreach the schooner. Then he returned to the room. Then he tried the\r\ncradle again, then walking, and again the cradle, and then once more\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\nSo the time passed.\r\n\r\nAt length, on looking down the road, he saw a female. She was walking\r\nup it, and would soon come near the house. On this woman he hung all his\r\nhopes. Perhaps she was Mrs. Corbet herself. The thought filled him with\r\njoy. If not, if she was a stranger, he determined to arrest her, and\r\nmake her soothe the frantic child.\r\n\r\nThe house stood back from the road about fifty yards. Pat watched\r\nthrough the window the motions of the approaching female, himself\r\nunseen. She drew nearer. At last her ears caught the cries of the baby.\r\nHer brows contracted. She walked faster. She reached the gate. She\r\nturned in.\r\n\r\n“I’t’s herself!” cried Pat.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to the cradle, and laid the screaming child inside. Then he\r\nsprang to the back door, and, closing it, stood outside, peeping through\r\nthe key-hole to see the result.\r\n\r\nThe woman entered with surprise on her face. She looked all around. She\r\ncalled “Corbet! Corbet!” in an angry voice. But no Corbet replied. Then\r\nshe went to the cradle, and took the baby in her arms, looking around\r\nwith wonder in her eyes. Then she soothed the baby, which speedily\r\nbecame quiet.\r\n\r\n“It’s Mrs. Corbet!” muttered Pat. “It’s herself! I’m safe! I’m free!\r\nI’ll run! Hurroo!”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he skipped away, and never stopped till he reached\r\nhis own room.\r\n\r\nThat evening the boys, on their return to the hill, were very curious to\r\nknow how Pat had fared with the baby. Captain Corbet had hinted that he\r\nhad left his child under Pat’s care, and many conjectures had been made\r\nas to the success of the new nurse. Pat, however, shunned the public eye\r\nfor that evening, so that it was not until the following day that they\r\nhad a chance of asking him about his experience. At first Pat fought\r\nthem off, and returned evasive answers; but gradually he disclosed all.\r\nThe curiosity of the boys then turned towards the meeting that may have\r\ntaken place between the indignant Mrs. Corbet and the innocent captain\r\non his return. But of the nature of that meeting they were destined\r\nto remain in ignorance. All was left to conjecture, and such powerful\r\nimaginations as theirs supplied them with many vivid fancy sketches\r\nof scenes wherein figured the justly irate wife, and the injured, yet\r\nforbearing, Corbet.\r\n\r\nTime passed on, until at length one afternoon a thrill of excitement was\r\nthrown over the playground by the appearance of Corbet himself. Like\r\nall popular favorites, he was received with an uproarious greeting. He\r\naccepted the tribute with a mild and pensive countenance, and by his\r\nmanner showed that something unusual was going to take place. What that\r\nwas they soon learned. With a moistened eye, and not without emotion, he\r\ninformed them that he was shortly about to leave them, and had come down\r\nfor the especial purpose of bidding them good by.\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received with astonishment and sorrow. Upon\r\nfurther questioning they learned that he was going to take a cargo of\r\npotatoes to Boston.\r\n\r\n“Yes, boys,” said he, mournfully, “the aged Corbet must again become\r\na wanderer with taters, his home the heavin billow, an his destination\r\nBosting. An individool of his years mought have hoped to rest his aged\r\nbones under his own roof a nussin of his babby; but Fate an the wife\r\nof his boosum stud clean agin it, tickerlarly the latter, bein a high\r\nsperrit an given to domineerin. So it hev kem abeout that sence the\r\nresurrection of the schewner she have fairly druv me from my natyve\r\nhearthstun, to temp the dangerous wave, an cross the briny main. Hence\r\nmy departoor with taters. All air ready. My boat air on the shore, an my\r\nbark air on the sea. Not that I regret the restoration of the schewner.\r\nI may be sundered far from my babby, but this I will say, that in the\r\ncabing of the Antelope reigns peace! Ef I can’t press my babby in my\r\nparential arms, I can hold his image in my pinin boosum. Besides, I can\r\nmake money for his footoor years, which, sence I’ve ben disappinted\r\nin the Frenchman’s money-hole, ain’t to be sneezed at. Ony when any of\r\nyouns goes an gits married, as some of you may some time dew,--take the\r\nword of an exile, and look out for temper!”\r\n\r\nHere Captain Corbet paused, and appeared somewhat agitated. He then\r\nprepared to bid them farewell. But the boys would not listen to this.\r\nHis farewell should take place elsewhere. He was going to leave on the\r\nnext day; and as that day was Saturday, they promised to be down at the\r\nwharf to see him off.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was to sail in the afternoon, and all the boys were on\r\nthe spot punctually, immediately after dinner. Soon Corbet made his\r\nappearance. The meek, the gentle, and the venerable navigator looked\r\nupon them all with a mournful smile.\r\n\r\n“You know the song you made, boys?” said he, sadly,\r\n\r\n                   “Should Captain Corbet be forgot,\r\n\r\n                   A sailing o’er the sea,”--\r\n\r\nwal--don’t forget me.”\r\n\r\n“Never,” cried Bart, as he grasped his hand in farewell. The melancholy\r\ncaptain then went round, and shook hands with all of them in silence.\r\nThen he went on board of his schooner. The Antelope had been renovated.\r\nAll the traces of her mishap had been obliterated. A coat of neat\r\ncoal tar covered her fair outlines. Another coat of grease adorned\r\nher tapering masts. Sundry patches were here and there visible on her\r\nflowing sails. That hold which had once carried the boys over Minas Bay\r\nwas now filled with potatoes. The tide was high and on the turn. The\r\nwind was fair. Corbet took the helm. The man Wade, whose old ‘oman’s\r\nname was Gipson, who had been mate on their memorable cruise, sailed now\r\nwith Captain Corbet in the following capacities:--\r\n\r\n1st mate,\r\n\r\n2d mate,\r\n\r\nSteward,\r\n\r\nCarpenter,\r\n\r\nCook,\r\n\r\nCabin boy,\r\n\r\nBoatswain,\r\n\r\nBoatswain’s mate,\r\n\r\nCrew.\r\n\r\nThe lines were cast off.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope caught the breeze, and yielding at the same moment to the\r\ntide, she moved away from the land, and down the tortuous channel of Mud\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nThe boys followed along the banks of the creek till they reached its\r\nmouth. Here they stood in silence.\r\n\r\nOutside, a thick veil of fog covered the water, and hid all the scene\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope sailed on, and, passing the boys, entered the water beyond.\r\nThe boys tossed up their hats, and breaking the solemn silence, sent\r\nover the water loud shouts of good by.\r\n\r\nThe shout reached the ears of the captain. He turned. His mild face was\r\nvisible for a few moments as he waved his hand again and again in token\r\nof adieu.\r\n\r\nThen he turned again.\r\n\r\nAnd so the boys stood there watching, until at last the Antelope entered\r\na thick fog bank, and bore the captain slowly away from their gaze.",
