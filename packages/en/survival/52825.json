Refined petroleum\r\nbreathes the breath of power to the internal combustion engine which\r\nclaims a realm of its own on land and sea, in the air, and under ocean\r\nwaters; it also gives artificial light to countless millions in all\r\ncorners of the world under a variety of circumstances and dissimilar\r\nconditions, while the wheels of industry unceasingly revolve consequent\r\nupon oil lubrication.\r\n\r\nAnd in no sphere of commercial and industrial activity has greater\r\nprogress been made during the past few decades than in regard to the\r\nmultiplication in the uses of the products of petroleum. The avenues\r\nfor advantageous consumption are constantly increasing, and this to\r\nsuch an extent that the production of crude petroleum--enormous though\r\nthis is--has been outstripped by the demands for the refined product.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have striven to deal with the chief phases of\r\nthe petroleum industry in a manner which, I have reason to believe,\r\nwill be acceptable to the general reader, and the fact that the volume\r\nis written in language free from technicalities, will, I trust, render\r\nit particularly interesting to those who would know something of that\r\nimmense class of commercial products covered by the name “Petroleum.”\r\n\r\n  ALBERT LIDGETT.\r\n\r\n  ROYAL AUTOMOBILE CLUB,\r\n  PALL MALL,\r\n  LONDON, S.W.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

As to the\r\nformer, this is a matter of historical interest; of the latter, the\r\nquestion is still in doubt--and the doubt becomes even the more\r\ndoubtful, the more the question is debated.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, take first the word “petroleum” as we know it\r\nto-day. It covers a multitude of products derived from the refining of\r\ncrude oil, though the word does not suggest any of them. It is quite\r\na generic term, and in a general way represents the whole of that\r\never-increasing family of hydrocarbons--the refined products of crude\r\noil. There is no doubt that it derives its name from the Latin _petra\r\noleum_, which, literally, is rock oil, and equivalents of the name are\r\nfound in all languages. Even in modern practice we use the word, though\r\nnot in a specific sense, while our own Government usually refers to\r\n“petroleum oil,” which, of course, involves tautology. Crude petroleum\r\nis known throughout the oil-fields of the world as denoting the crude\r\noil coming from the wells: then we have petroleum spirit, otherwise the\r\nlightest form of refined oil; we have petroleum distillate, designating\r\nan illuminating oil; but, “petroleum oil” is, it is to be regretted,\r\ngenerally used as suggesting some form of petroleum product.\r\n\r\nThough the petroleum industry--in its commercial sense--only goes back\r\nsome sixty years, the use of petroleum can be traced to Biblical times,\r\nfor was it not the great Prophet Elisha who told the widow to “Go, sell\r\nthe oil and pay thy debts and live”?\r\n\r\nJob also speaks of the rock which poured him out rivers of oil; in\r\nMaccabees we find that the priests hid the fire which they took from\r\nthe altar in a deep pit without water; while Nehemiah called the liquid\r\nwhich burst into flame and kindled a great fire by the name “Nephthar,\r\nwhich is as much as to say, a cleansing; but many call it Nephai.” And\r\nso, in many parts of the Old as well as in the New Testament, oil is\r\nclearly referred to, and, in Biblical times, as much later, was looked\r\nupon as a sacred fire.\r\n\r\nMany ancient authors make extensive reference to oil, prominent among\r\nthem being Herodotus, who described the methods adopted at the pits of\r\nKirab for the raising of the oil, which liquid “gives off a very strong\r\nodour.”\r\n\r\nPetroleum, as known in Biblical times, and as so widely known to-day,\r\noccurs in greater or less quantity throughout the world, and it is\r\nfound in the whole range of strata of the earth’s crust, from the\r\nLaurentian rocks to the most recent members of the Quaternary period,\r\nthough it is found in commercial quantities almost wholly in the\r\ncomparatively old Devonian and Carboniferous formations on the one hand\r\nor in the various divisions of the comparatively young Tertiary rocks\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the origin of petroleum has been the subject of\r\nconsiderable scientific controversy for many years. Not a few of the\r\nleading scientists hold to the theory that petroleum is derived from\r\nmetallic carbides lying far beneath the porous strata in which the oil\r\nis stored by Nature, and that even at the present time the process is\r\nin operation. This idea, which may be termed the inorganic theory of\r\npetroleum origin, was considered to have received substantial support\r\nwhen it was found that the action of water on the carbides of certain\r\nmetals resulted in the liberation of hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nThe view that petroleum is of organic origin is to-day almost\r\nuniversally accepted, although there is no general agreement either\r\nas to whether petroleum is derived from vegetable or animal matter,\r\nor as to the forms of life that provided for its genesis. In certain\r\nplaces in the world--notably on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea\r\nand also near the Mediterranean--there is some conversion of organic\r\nmatter into petroleum actually to be seen to-day. It is not difficult,\r\nas the late Sir Boverton Redwood, Bart., pointed out in an address\r\nbefore the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1918, to account for\r\nthe formation of adequate deposits of the necessary material. In the\r\ncomparatively deep and quiescent water along the margin of the land in\r\npast ages, there would be abundant opportunity for the deposition not\r\nonly of the remains of marine animals and plants, but also of vegetable\r\nmatter brought down to the coast by the water courses, and the changes\r\nwhich the earth has undergone would result in the burial of these\r\nsubstances under sedimentary mineral matter, the deposits thus formed\r\nbeing ultimately, as the result of further alterations in the earth’s\r\nsurface, frequently found occupying positions far removed from the sea,\r\nand sometimes beneath immense thicknesses of subsequent deposits.\r\n\r\nThat vegetable matter may be the source of certain petroleums is an\r\nopinion that has found increasing evidence to support it. There are two\r\nkinds of vegetable matter which are possible, terrestrial and aquatic,\r\nand in the deltaic conditions that characterize so many oil-fields,\r\neither could be equally well appealed to as a source of accumulation.\r\nThe extensive coal and lignite deposits in many geological periods\r\nbear eloquent testimony to the presence of carbonaceous matter far\r\nin excess of that required to provide proved supplies of petroleum.\r\nEvery important coal-field demonstrates the fact that vegetable matter\r\ncan be partially converted into bituminous compounds or hydrocarbons\r\nby natural processes. Marsh gases often occur in great quantities in\r\nfaulted zones in the coal measures, though the bituminous substances\r\nfound in coal are not true bitumens that dissolve in the usual\r\nsolvents, while the tars derived from the destructive distillation of\r\ncoal in no way resemble natural petroleums or the products of oil-shale\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the outstanding differences between petroleum,\r\noil-shales and coal, I might here point out in favour of the vegetable\r\ntheory of origin, that actual petroleum and true bitumens have been\r\nfound in some coals, though in small quantities, while solid paraffins\r\nhave been extracted by means of pyridine and chloroform. Again, low\r\ntemperature distillations have yielded petroleum hydrocarbons, all\r\nof which appear to indicate that even when coal was the overwhelming\r\nproduct, at certain times and places the conditions were merging into\r\nthose which could yield petroleum. There is no doubt that each of the\r\nvarious views expressed as to the organic origin of petroleum contains\r\nelements of truth, and it is reasonable to assume that a substance so\r\nvaried in its physical and chemical properties as petroleum has not in\r\nall cases been created under precisely the same conditions, or from an\r\nexactly similar source.\r\n\r\nSumming up the whole question of origin, however, the balance of\r\nopinion points to its being the result of organic action, and that the\r\npetroleum which we now find in the Palaeozoic and Tertiary rocks is\r\nsubstantially of the same geological age as the rocks themselves.\r\n\r\nVolumes of technological literature have been written upon this complex\r\nquestion of petroleum origin, and though these may be of intense\r\ninterest to the student of geology, the brief references which I have\r\nalready given to the question are sufficient for the purpose of this\r\nlittle publication.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of petroleum throughout the two\r\nhemispheres is no less wide than the geological. The deposits mainly\r\noccur along well-defined lines, often associated with the mountain\r\nranges. This is chiefly due to the formation, in the elevatory process,\r\nof minor folds which have arrested and collected the oil in richly\r\nproductive belts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OIL-FIELDS OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since petroleum and its products entered the realm of commercial\r\ncommodities, there has been a ceaseless search throughout the two\r\nhemispheres for crude oil, and to-day there are comparatively few\r\ncountries in the world where the presence of petroleum has not been\r\nproved. The ever-expanding uses of petroleum, which in their train\r\nhave called for a continually increasing demand for crude oil, have\r\ngiven an impetus to the search for commercially productive oil-fields,\r\nwhich, in mining history, has no parallel. On the one hand, we have\r\nthose important oil-producing regions which embrace enormous regions of\r\nthe United States, Mexico, Russia, Roumania, the Dutch Indies, India,\r\nand Galicia; on the other, we find comparatively recent enterprise\r\nwhich is bringing into prominence the newer oil-producing regions of\r\nEgypt, Trinidad, Canada, the Argentine, Algeria, and various parts\r\nof Australia and Japan, though in several of these latter mentioned\r\ncountries, the production of petroleum has been carried on by private\r\nmeans for not only many years, but even for centuries.\r\n\r\nIt naturally follows that, with the constant withdrawal of large\r\nsupplies of crude oil from Mother Earth, Nature’s stores must be\r\ngrowing less, and it is not surprising, therefore, to hear, with\r\npersistent regularity, alarming rumours of the coming dearth of crude\r\noil. Experts have devoted considerable time and thought in an endeavour\r\nto arrive at a conclusion as to the length of time it will take for the\r\nwithdrawal of practically the whole of the crude oil from the known\r\ndeposits in the more developed fields: their conclusions, however, are\r\nwidely different, for while some assert that in the United States, for\r\ninstance, the known fields will cease to be commercially productive\r\nwithin forty years, others there are who declare that centuries must\r\nelapse before the question of a failing supply need call for serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBut there is one point which must not be overlooked in this connection,\r\nand that is the fact that, while thus far very few thoroughly developed\r\noil-fields have shown signs of permanent decay, there are numerous\r\nothers which, while having already furnished conclusive proof of their\r\nproductivity, have, for the most part, been but slightly developed.\r\nEach passing year registers the incoming of fresh oil-producing areas,\r\nwhile numerous regions in practically every part of the world, giving\r\nmuch promise of the success of ultimate oil developments, are as yet\r\nvirgin territory.\r\n\r\nThe cry of possible shortage of supply was, fortunately, made at the\r\nopportune moment: it was a word of warning, and was taken to heart\r\nespecially by those associated with the development of the older\r\nproducing oil-fields. In these fields--whether we look to America or\r\nRussia--there has always been considerable waste of crude oil, mostly\r\nin regard to furnishing power for oil-field operations, while the\r\nnatural gases which exude from the wells themselves, and to which\r\nreference is made in another chapter, have, in times past, been\r\nallowed to pass uncontrolled into the atmosphere. To-day, however,\r\nwe see conservation in every direction--thanks to the application\r\nof scientific and engineering knowledge, combined with the exercise\r\nof care--and there is no doubt that this new factor will tend in a\r\ngreater degree than may at first be imagined toward the preservation of\r\nNature’s stores of crude oil for unlimited time.\r\n\r\nWith these few general remarks, let us proceed to briefly survey the\r\nprincipal oil-fields of the world, leaving those which are in the\r\nprocess of development or exploitation to later consideration.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.--In no other country has such continuous progress\r\nbeen recorded in connection with the production of petroleum as in\r\nthe case of the United States. Quite recently, the U.S. Geological\r\nSurvey estimated that there are no less than 9,000 square miles of\r\noil-bearing territory in the States, yet the petroleum industry was\r\nnot commercially established until the early sixties of the last\r\ncentury. It was in Pennsylvania that the industry had its birth,\r\nand the troubles which beset Drake, the pioneer, have filled many\r\npages of early oil literature. His first well, which produced quite\r\na modest yield of crude oil, was at Titusville, Pa., which spot soon\r\nbecame a thriving town. And as Pennsylvania was the scene of the early\r\nsuccesses, it also became the pivot round which the petroleum industry\r\nof the States prospered for many years. Until 1885, the Pennsylvanian\r\nfields furnished over 98 per cent. of the production of crude oil: then\r\na gradual decline set in, until, at the present time, Pennsylvanian\r\nregions do not produce 10 per cent. of the oil output of the United\r\nStates. No sooner had the petroleum industry been firmly established in\r\nPennsylvania than an active search was made for the precious fluid in\r\nvarious parts of the States, and one by one new oil regions were opened\r\nup, but it is interesting to recall the fact that, even in the first\r\ndeveloped oil-producing region, no district has been entirely abandoned\r\nas exhausted of oil, for to-day wells are being pumped quite close to\r\nDrake’s first well and the scene of the birth of the American petroleum\r\nindustry. In the zenith of its prosperity, the Pennsylvanian field\r\nproduced nearly 5,000,000 tons of crude oil per annum, but to-day the\r\noutput has fallen off nearly 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen it is mentioned that the output of crude petroleum from the\r\nvarious fields of the United States last year was over 40,000,000 tons,\r\nthe magnitude of America’s oil industry will at once be apparent.\r\nThe regions known as the Mid-Continent fields--and which embrace the\r\nextensive oil-producing regions of Kansas and Oklahoma--are responsible\r\nfor a very large portion of this output. Each field has its various\r\n“pools,” the most famous of this part, perhaps, being the Cushing pool,\r\nwhich came into prominence but a few years ago. Toward the end of 1914,\r\nit was estimated that the daily output of Cushing was 35,000 tons of\r\ncrude oil. Cushing, like all other prolific oil districts, has many\r\ninteresting stories associated with its rapid rise as an oil-producing\r\ncentre, and there are instances on record where, in the course of a few\r\ndays, land values have increased tenfold.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Californian fields, too, is an example of the rapidity\r\nwith which oil regions can be developed. California’s output in 1919\r\nwas, roughly, 120,000,000 barrels of crude oil, or over 14,000,000\r\ntons. It possesses nearly 900 square miles of oil-lands, and though at\r\none time a great difficulty was experienced in disposing of the crude\r\noil production, since it was of a somewhat low grade, the position has\r\nnow been reversed, and the consumption of petroleum products is greater\r\nthan the supply. With the improvement of the methods of drilling, and\r\nthe debut of the rotary system, it has been possible not only to drill\r\nto much greater depths, but to considerably reduce the time requisite\r\nfor drilling a well to the oil sands. Californian records for quick\r\ndrilling with the rotary machine show that wells have been got down\r\nto the producing sands, in some fields nearly 4,000 feet below the\r\nsurface, within one month. This deep drilling policy, which is now\r\nmuch in vogue among Californian oil operators, has proved the existence\r\nat the greater depth of larger volume of oil of far better quality\r\nthan that met with in the shallow strata, and it is to the discovery\r\nand consequent development of the deeper oil horizons that much of\r\nCalifornia’s recent advance is due.\r\n\r\nThough but of small significance, the oil-wells in Summerland, Cal.,\r\ncall for mention for the reason that these are drilled in the sea at\r\nquite a distance from the coast. The encroachment of sea-water to the\r\nwells themselves is prevented by the continuance of the tubes in the\r\nwells to a height above the level of high-water mark, the produced oil\r\nbeing piped to the mainland.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a wonderful future awaits California in regard\r\nto its oil export trade. The Far East is largely drawing upon the\r\nState for crude oil for treatment in the Far Eastern refineries: the\r\noil-burning vessels of the Pacific rely upon Californian fuel oil\r\nfor their supplies, while the opening of the Panama Canal, and the\r\nestablishment of oil storage depots there, has brought California\r\nwithin easy transport distance of the European markets. During the past\r\nfew years several cargoes of Californian refined oil have, in fact,\r\ncome upon the English market.\r\n\r\nThe oil-fields of Texas have, perhaps, witnessed more “boom” periods\r\nthan any other oil regions of the States. The Gulf coastal fields which\r\nembrace Texas and Louisiana, came into prominence some seventeen years\r\nago, and they were not long in recording an output of over 5,000,000\r\ntons in a single twelve months. The prolific districts of Spindle Top,\r\nSour Lake, Humble, etc., attracted rapid attention, and the speculator\r\nin oil lands became immensely rich. But these boom periods cannot be\r\nsaid to be of much real value to the oil industry, for they are\r\nalways followed by times of depression, when fortunes are lost almost\r\nas quickly as they have been made. To-day, the Gulf coast fields have\r\nsettled down to a period of steady expansion; systematic development is\r\ntaking place in every field, and, as in California, the policy of deep\r\ndrilling has been eminently successful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GLEN POOL--ONE OF AMERICA’S OIL PRODUCING CENTRES]\r\n\r\nSpace forbids my entering into details respecting the more recently\r\ndeveloped or partially exploited fields of America, but it is safe to\r\nsay that there is scarcely a single State that does not hold out hope\r\nfor profitable oil development: this is evidenced by the large amounts\r\nof new capital which are to-day finding employment in regions which are\r\nonly commencing their oil-field history.\r\n\r\nThere is no other oil-producing country in the world where the\r\npetroleum industry has reached such a highly organized state as in\r\nthe United States. Each producing field is connected by means of\r\nunderground pipe-lines with the trunk pipe-line system, by which it\r\nis possible to pump oil from the most distant fields direct to the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. Some of the principal lines are hundreds of miles\r\nin length. In another chapter I deal with this wonderful system of oil\r\ntransportation: it is, therefore, unnecessary here to more than mention\r\nit _en passant_. The oil-refining branch of the American petroleum\r\nindustry is also particularly well organized and up to date, but with\r\nthis subject, too, I deal at length elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL GEOLOGICAL SECTION SHOWING THE OIL SANDS]\r\n\r\nMEXICO.--The oil-fields of Mexico can claim to have leapt into\r\nprominence at a far more rapid rate than any other oil-field of\r\nimportance in the world. Their development has been phenomenal, and\r\nfrom being practically unknown sixteen years ago, they now rank as\r\nthe third largest producing regions, coming but next to the United\r\nStates and Russia. My object in dealing with the Mexican fields prior\r\nto referring to the Russian petroleum industry is that they may be said\r\nto form an integral part of the fields of the New Continent, and, from\r\nmany points of view, are linked up with the petroleum industry of the\r\nUnited States. Indeed, there are several authorities who are now urging\r\nthat it is to Mexico that the United States Government must look if it\r\nis to be in a position to furnish the major portion of the petroleum\r\nproducts required for the markets of the world. Another reason for my\r\ndealing with Mexico at the moment is that, when development operations\r\nare carried a little further, and when ocean transport facilities are\r\navailable for adequately dealing with the flood of Mexican petroleum,\r\nthere is not the slightest doubt that Mexico will rank as the second\r\nlargest country of petroleum production. Its annual output of crude\r\noil is, approximately, 8,000,000 tons, but even this figure in no way\r\nrepresents the productivity of its prolific oil-producing regions,\r\nfor according to the official statement of the Mexican Government the\r\nproduction in 1918 represented only 10 per cent. of that possible. The\r\nMexican wells have no parallel in the world, large as have been some of\r\nthe oil-fountains in Russia.\r\n\r\nIt will be of great interest here to refer briefly to these, and though\r\nit would be impossible to detail all those Mexican wells which have\r\nranked quite outside the limits of ordinary producers, I will touch\r\nonly upon two of these remarkable oil gushers. They both were drilled\r\non the properties owned by the well-known English firm of Pearsons, the\r\noperating company being the “Aguila” (Mexican Eagle) Company. It was in\r\n1906 when the Company commenced active drilling operations in Northern\r\nVera Cruz, and though these were very successful from the start, it\r\nwas two years later that the famous “Dos Bocas” well came in. A heavy\r\ngas pressure developed when the rotary drill was down just over 1,800\r\nfeet, and in a few minutes the internal pressure manifested itself by\r\nbursting the wire-wrapped hose connected with the drilling apparatus.\r\nThe oil then commenced to come to the surface in an immense stream, and\r\nin twenty minutes the well was beyond control. Fissures began to appear\r\nin the ground at considerable distance from the well, and through\r\nthese came oil and gas. One of these fissures opened directly under\r\nthe boilers, and though the fires had been drawn, the gas ignited. The\r\nposition was well-nigh hopeless from the start, the well itself was\r\nthrowing out an 8-inch column of oil hundreds of feet in the air. The\r\nforce of the volume of oil below ground flung the heavy English drill\r\npipe out of the well, and soon it became impossible to approach within\r\n300 feet of the “mad gusher.” The flames of fire are said to have\r\nreached 1,000 feet in height, and inasmuch as all ground round the well\r\nhad fallen into the cavity caused, they were over 50 feet in diameter.\r\nAnd for 58 days did this gusher burn with all the fury imaginable, its\r\nglare being seen far out at sea. Anything approaching an approximate\r\nproduction of oil from this well will never be made: it can safely be\r\nrecorded, however, that its mad flow of oil ran into many millions of\r\nbarrels, and it is placed on record that nearly 2,000,000 tons of solid\r\nearth were carried away by the force of the oil from the well’s mouth,\r\nfor a crater of nearly 120,000 square metres was formed round the well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GUSHER OF THE MEXICAN EAGLE CO. UNDER CONTROL--A DOME\r\nBUILT OVER THE MOUTH]\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1910 another surprise was in store for those in\r\ncharge of drilling operations for the Company, for it was then that the\r\nworld famous “Protero del Llano” gusher came in. This well ranks as one\r\nof the largest, if not the largest, ever associated with the petroleum\r\nindustry. Its estimated daily flow was over 125,000 barrels, and within\r\nthree months the well had produced over 8,000,000 barrels of crude oil.\r\n\r\nDuring November, 1919, a new field at Naranjos was developed by the\r\nMexican Eagle Co., and the first three wells to come into production,\r\ncommenced to yield over 30,000 tons daily.\r\n\r\nIt says much for the enterprise of the Pearson (Lord Cowdray) interests\r\nthat they have been able to build up such a remarkable business in\r\nMexico’s oil industry in so comparatively a short space of time. The\r\nproduction of crude oil, as everyone knows, is but the first link in\r\na long chain of commercial oil operations. To-day, the Mexican Eagle\r\nOil Company owns considerably over 250 miles of pipe-line (mostly\r\nof 8-inch capacity), possess several miniature railways, and on the\r\nfields of production has bulk oil storage accommodation for several\r\nmillion barrels of crude oil. It has also two large refineries--one\r\nat Minatitlan and another at Tampico, which together are capable of\r\nhandling over 5,000 tons (about 35,000 barrels) of crude oil daily, and\r\nturning the same into a complete range of high-grade products--motor\r\nspirit, illuminating oils, lubricants, fuel oil, paraffin wax, and an\r\nasphalt for road-making.\r\n\r\nAn interesting equipment of this Company in Mexico is that of its\r\nsea-loading pipe-lines at Tuxpam. Here, the water inside the bar is\r\ntoo shallow to allow the gigantic bulk oil-carriers of the Company’s\r\nassociated concern--the Eagle Oil Transport Company, Ltd.--to come\r\nalongside and load. Pipe-lines have accordingly been laid on the\r\nbed of the sea reaching out to a loading terminal a mile and a half\r\nout at sea. Here, the pipe-lines are connected with the steamers by\r\nmeans of flexible hose, and three or four tank vessels can be loaded\r\nsimultaneously from the storage tanks on shore. In one recent twelve\r\nmonths alone over 200 oil tankers were so loaded in this way, and on\r\nthe average, each was loaded and dispatched within 2½ days, for the\r\npipe-line facilities permit of 10,000 tons of oil being pumped into the\r\nvessel’s tanks every 24 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE THE DERRICK OF AN AMERICAN OIL WELL]\r\n\r\nThere are several large amalgamations of capital interested in the\r\ndevelopment of the Mexican fields--American and English, while, prior\r\nto the war, the Germans had anxious eyes upon this growing industry,\r\nand even formulated plans whereby German interests would be largely\r\nrepresented in its future.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of the Mexican fields, might I say that no other\r\noil-producing regions have, in the short space of time during which\r\ndevelopments have taken place, exercised such an influence upon the\r\ninternational oil situation as has Mexico. This may be traced to the\r\nfact that Mexican oil is an admirable liquid fuel, and as such is now\r\nin regular use the world over. The vast consuming centres in the South\r\nAmerican Continent have seen that, whereas coal is very dear, it is\r\npossible to secure almost unlimited supplies of Mexican fuel oil almost\r\nat their own doors, while overseas, consequent upon the advent of the\r\nfuel oil age, Mexican fuel oil is playing a most important part, and\r\nto-day is in great demand for the mercantile fleet.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.--Long before the commercial value of petroleum and its products\r\nwas established, Baku--the present centre of the Russian petroleum\r\nindustry--had become famous for its “Eternal Fires,” and it was to\r\nthat place the Parsees made pilgrimages for over 1,000 years; in fact,\r\ncenturies before the Russians occupied the Caucasus, the tribes of\r\nPersia eagerly sought the oils of Baku for their curative qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Russian oil-fields have an output of, approximately, 10,000,000\r\ntons annually, or, roughly, 15 per cent. of the world’s total\r\nproduction of crude oil. Since the time when the petroleum industry\r\nwas placed upon a commercial footing, the Russian fields have produced\r\n230,000,000 tons of petroleum. Enormous though this quantity is, it\r\nhas been more than doubled by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe oil-fields of Baku have gained a distinction for the reason that\r\nnumerous individual wells have given forth a flood of crude oil which\r\nhas, with very few exceptions, been unknown in other petroliferous\r\nregions. The Baku fields proper embrace the districts of Balakhany,\r\nSaboontchi, Romany, and Bibi Eibat: the first three districts stand on\r\na plateau but a few miles from Baku, while Bibi Eibat is located quite\r\nnear the Caspian Sea, on a bay from which the field takes its name.\r\nOne remarkable feature of these fields--as showing their prolific oil\r\ncontent--is that the four main oil-producing districts in Baku have an\r\narea of less than 4,000 acres. It is in this locality that the Russian\r\npetroleum industry, having had its birth, became centred, and though\r\nit is known that there are several really promising oil areas in this\r\nsouth-western part of the Caucasus, the fact that the lands belong to\r\nthe State has been a sufficient stumbling-block to development in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nApart from the Baku fields, the most highly developed oil-field\r\nof importance in Russia is that of Grosny, which is situated on\r\nthe northern slopes of the Caucasian range and connected with the\r\nVladicaucas railway by a branch line. The Grosny field, however, has\r\nonly been developed during the past fifteen years in what may be called\r\na commercial sense, but its operated area is almost double that of\r\nBaku. It has greatly suffered owing to the inadequacy of transport\r\nfacilities, but in 1919 a project was drafted to build a pipe-line to\r\nthe Black Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not a feature of this little publication that minor regions\r\nshall be all enumerated, and thus I may be forgiven if I refer but\r\nto one of the several new districts which have recently attracted\r\nthe attention of both oil operators and speculators. I refer to the\r\nMaikop fields, which prominently came before the British investing\r\npublic in 1910, and which were directly responsible for the oil boom\r\nof that year. A few months before, a very prolific spouter of oil had\r\nbeen struck in Maikop, which was then quite an agricultural centre,\r\nand enormous excitement followed. Land was quickly taken over at\r\never-increasing prices, and the boom, for which English capital was\r\nlargely responsible, lasted for several months. There have been many\r\nopinions put forward by supposed experts in oil geology for and against\r\nthe Maikop oil region, but the kindest thing of all that can be said\r\nfor the district is that, while there was really no justification\r\nfor the remarkable Maikop oil boom of 1910, there was certainly no\r\nreason why public opinion should so rapidly change in regard to its\r\npotentialities. I have every reason to believe that some day Maikop\r\nwill justify the optimistic opinions held for it during the boom, but\r\nin the eyes of the English investor the region bears the stamp of\r\nfraud, for the simple reason that so many have invested their savings\r\nin it, and have been doomed to acute disappointment.\r\n\r\nSome millions of English money went into Maikop oil enterprises during\r\nthat ill-fated oil boom, but a very small percentage of this went to\r\nreally prove the contents of the lower strata. The fact that the ground\r\nwas simply “scratched” and condemned because it did not respond with\r\noil fountains, cannot in the slightest affect the ultimate career of\r\nthe Maikop oil region, the presence of oil in which has been known\r\neven from ancient times. Looking back upon that Maikop oil boom, one\r\ncannot but express surprise at our gullibility generally: we stake our\r\nfaith and our capital upon what at the best is a sheer gamble, and\r\nwe seem content if we find that anything approaching 20 per cent. of\r\nthe money subscribed actually goes into the serious development of the\r\nscheme which we fancied. There are a few who grow suddenly rich upon\r\nthe spoils of such oil booms--I know some of these personally, and to\r\nme it has always been a source of keen regret that the State does not\r\nexercise something of a rigid control over these publicly invested\r\nfunds. I cannot here refrain, while on the subject of the Maikop oil\r\nboom, just making a remark as to the overrated value which the public\r\ngenerally attach to the reports of many gentlemen looked upon as oil\r\nexperts. Some remarkable stories are associated with the locking up\r\n(and loss) of English moneys in the Maikop boom, but the strangest\r\nI know is of a Russian who came to England when the boom was at its\r\nheight, for the purpose of selling a number of Maikop oil claims.\r\nThere were many prospective buyers, but it was necessary to possess a\r\nreport from some supposed “oil expert.” To save time, the seller of the\r\nclaims drafted what he considered quite an alluring statement, and the\r\nnext day the report, couched in the same language, bore the “expert’s”\r\nsignature. And the “wheeze” worked.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the main subject. Prior to 1870, the crude petroleum\r\nin the Baku district, as well as in the minor fields of Russia, was\r\nobtained from surface pits, dug by hand, and rarely more than 50\r\nfeet deep, and the production was carried away from the mouth of the\r\nshaft in leathern bottles. The general arrangements were on the most\r\nprimitive lines, but, nevertheless, the industry--such as it was\r\nthen--thrived. Even to-day in several fields in Russia we see the\r\nsurvival of the hand-dug wells, but they are steadily becoming a\r\nfeature of a page of oil-field history which is almost filled.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1873 that Robert Nobel went to Baku, and to his enterprise\r\nand technical genius a great deal of the subsequent rapid development\r\nof the Russian industry is due. Boring by steam power was introduced,\r\nand the deeper oil horizons were reached, but, owing to the depth at\r\nwhich the strata became commercially productive, it was necessary to\r\ncommence the well with a starting diameter of 36-40 inches, so as to\r\nensure the requisite depth being obtained with a workable size of\r\nbaler--for the Baku crude oils are “baled” from the wells. Upon the\r\nquestion of baling wells, I shall have something to say in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nUnder the improved conditions which were introduced in methods of\r\nboring and operating the oil-wells, the industry steadily expanded,\r\nthe general awakening of boring enterprise being best reflected in the\r\nnumber of oil-wells in operation in subsequent years. For instance,\r\nin 1893, the Baku fields could boast of but 458 bore-holes; in 1898,\r\nthe number had increased to 1,107; in 1903, it was about 2,000; while\r\nin 1911, there were over 3,000 bore-holes in the Baku fields. There\r\nhas been a steady decline in the number of these bore-holes since\r\n1914 due in some part, I assume, to the difficulties of securing the\r\nrequisite materials for new boring, combined with the enormous increase\r\nin the cost of the same. The drilling of the wells in Russia is a very\r\nexpensive item, for they cost from anything over £10,000 up to £15,000,\r\nand usually take a couple of years to drill. But when they are down\r\nto the producing strata and commence production, it can be taken for\r\ngranted that they will continue, providing ordinary care is taken of\r\nthe well itself, for many years to profitably produce.\r\n\r\nThe Russian petroleum industry is in the hands of a large number of\r\noperating firms, the majority of which work quite independently of\r\neach other, and these independent firms are responsible for more than\r\none-half of the total output. The other production of the crude oil,\r\nrepresenting certainly over 40 per cent., is in the hands of combines\r\nrepresenting the large and middle-class firms, prominent among which\r\nwe get the firm of Messrs. Nobel Brothers, the “Shell” group, and the\r\nGeneral Russian Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe refining of the crude oil is carried out in Baku, the portion of\r\nthe town in which this operation takes place being known as Blacktown.\r\nIt does not belie its name either. At one time these refineries, or at\r\nleast many of them, were erected in the centre of the town of Baku, or\r\nnear it, and made it almost uninhabitable by their smoke, smell, and\r\nrefuse, the latter flowing into the streets and the harbour. A special\r\ndistrict was therefore selected, to which all had to remove, and it is\r\nthis portion of the town which forms “Blacktown” to-day.\r\n\r\nOne of the great difficulties of the Russian refining industry in its\r\ncommencement was due to the fact that sulphuric acid, so absolute a\r\nnecessity in petroleum refining, had to be brought from Europe at great\r\nexpense, but in 1883, Messrs. Nobel built a factory for its production\r\non the spot from Caucasian pyrites, mined in the neighbourhood of\r\nAlexandropol. Other factories for the same purpose and for the\r\nregeneration of the acids have since that time been established.\r\n\r\nAs in other great industries, so in regard to the methods by which the\r\nRussian crude oil is transported and to-day handled, great strides\r\nforward have been made since the early days. Then the whole of the\r\nprevailing conditions were primitive: crude oil, for instance, was\r\ncarried from the Baku wells to the refineries in skins and barrels\r\nloaded on carts or camels. Messrs. Nobel Brothers were the first to\r\nlay a pipe-line to their factory, but later on pipes were laid between\r\nthe refineries and the harbour, these obvious improvements meeting\r\nwith fierce resistance on the part of the workpeople. The transport of\r\nthe refined products from Baku to the consumers was equally difficult.\r\nThere was then no railway from Baku to Tiflis, and the only way to\r\nthe Black Sea was thus effectively shut off. On the other hand, the\r\nnavigation of the Volga was only possible during six months of the\r\nyear, while the monopoly of water transport on the Caspian Sea imposed\r\nhigh rates on all Baku petroleum products.\r\n\r\nImprovements were again due to the enterprise of Messrs. Nobel\r\nBrothers, who built the first cistern waggons for transporting oil on\r\nthe railways, instead of using the old wooden barrels, which were far\r\nfrom satisfactory. In order, too, to open an outlet on the Black Sea,\r\nthe same firm, in 1889, constructed a pipe-line from Mikhailovo to\r\nKvirili, over the Suram mountains. Now, of course, we have the great\r\npipe-line running from Baku to Batoum, a distance of nearly 560 miles,\r\nand which is responsible for the transport of the quantities of Russian\r\noil exported.\r\n\r\nBut the Russian petroleum industry has always existed more or less\r\nunder a cloud. The old regime of Government did not attempt to foster\r\nand encourage the industry from which it received so much yearly in\r\nroyalties, for it must be recollected that the Russian State was the\r\nchief gainer by the exploitation of the Baku oil lands, owing to the\r\nprevalence of the system of royalties. It seemed to be content to\r\nleave the industry to its fate, so long as it received therefrom so\r\nsubstantial a sum in royalties, etc. Instances are on record where\r\noperating firms pay the Government 40 per cent., or even more, of\r\ntheir crude oil production as royalties--payment for the privilege of\r\ntaking the oil from the ground. Such conditions have been relentlessly\r\nimposed, and it is not surprising to find that, operating under this\r\nburden of expense, numerous firms find it quite out of the question\r\nto earn profits for their shareholders. Several English enterprises\r\ncome into this category, but the fault is not of their seeking; it is,\r\nhowever, to be regretted, for once an equitable system of payments\r\nis arranged, the Russian petroleum industry will expand in a healthy\r\nmanner, and become a much greater source of revenue to the State than\r\nit is at present.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the troubles which have to be faced by the Baku oil\r\nproducers, and which we may call Governmental, the relation between the\r\nemployers and workpeople is far from being friendly. To-day, of course,\r\nit is worse than it was under the old regime of the Tzar, and then it\r\nwas bad enough. The oil-field workman in Russia is the incarnation\r\nof all that is unsatisfactory. He works when he thinks he will, he\r\nlabours under grievances, many of which are purely imaginary, and then\r\nhe ventilates his spite upon his masters. The pages of history tell\r\nof many a conflict between capital and labour in the Baku oil-fields,\r\nwith the consequent burning of all that would take fire on the fields,\r\nand the damaging of the producing wells by the workpeople. Instances\r\nare placed on record where, in a single night, dozens of productive\r\noil-wells, which have taken years to bring into production, have been\r\nirreparably damaged by these oil-field workers. Their life, admitted,\r\nis nothing to write books upon, and their environments are in some\r\ncases of the worst description, rendered no better by the natural\r\naptitude of the people themselves. But their views upon labour are of\r\nthe most Utopian imaginable. During recent years, there has been a sort\r\nof combination between these operatives, whose socialistic tendencies\r\nrun high, and less than two years ago they collectively put before the\r\nmanagers of the oil-fields the conditions under which they would in\r\nfuture work. There were nearly 100 different claims detailed, and a few\r\nof these are worthy of mention, as showing the appreciation of fairness\r\nwhich is instilled in the mind of the Russian oil-field worker. In the\r\nfirst place, a 50 per cent. increase in wages was desired, this to be\r\nretrospective. Holidays had to be paid for by the masters, and when the\r\nworker went on strike he had to receive his full pay from the master\r\nuntil such strike was settled. Then the workmen had to be represented\r\non the board of management of the companies, their houses had to be\r\nimproved by the masters, free railway and tramway accommodation had to\r\nbe provided, etc. Generally, the demands put forward were distinctly\r\narbitrary, though in many cases very humorous.\r\n\r\nRecent events in the conduct of affairs in Russia do not suggest that\r\ngreat improvements may be expected in the near future, either in\r\nregard to the attitude of the Government toward the Russian petroleum\r\nindustry, or to the attitude of the workers to those responsible\r\nfor oil-field operations. Even before the European War, the Russian\r\npetroleum industry was rather on the decline. The only hope that can\r\nbe expressed at this juncture is that when Russia possesses a stable\r\ngovernment, and the country enters upon a period of peaceful progress,\r\nthe Mining Department will take care that Russia takes its proper\r\nposition as one of the most important oil-producing countries in the\r\nworld. But before this comes about, there will have to be a complete\r\nrevision of the Government’s policy respecting oil royalties. The\r\ndestruction, however, wrought in Baku towards the end of 1918 will take\r\nseveral years to make good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUMANIA: A FEW OF THE HAND DUG WELLS IN BUSTENARI]\r\n\r\nROUMANIA.--During comparatively recent time, Roumania has come\r\nprominently forward as one of the large petroleum-producing countries\r\nof the world, and its yearly output of crude oil, according to latest\r\nreturns, is about 11,000,000 barrels, or, say, 1,600,000 tons. The\r\nproduction of petroleum in the country, however, has been proceeding\r\nfor centuries, for, in the seventeenth century, the peasants were\r\nin the habit of digging wells by hand and selling the crude oil for\r\nmedicinal purposes, the greasing of cart-wheels, as well as for\r\nlighting. There are many places in Roumania which are named from\r\npetroleum, a fact which points to the existence of the industry long\r\nbefore the present-day methods of extraction were thought of. Several\r\nhundreds of these hand-dug wells still exist round the fringe of the\r\nTransylvanian and Carpathian Alps, and though many of them have now\r\nfallen into decay, there are numerous others from which a payable\r\nquantity of petroleum is extracted by primitive methods.\r\n\r\nThe hand-dug wells in Roumania are highly interesting relics of a\r\nperiod which is now relegated to the past, though so long as the\r\nRoumanian petroleum industry exists, so long will the old hand-dug\r\nwells be associated with it. These wells are about 5 feet in diameter,\r\nand are sunk through alternate layers of clay, schisty clay, sandy\r\nclay, sandstone, and petroliferous sand to the more shallow oil\r\nhorizons. They are dug by workmen who descend dressed with the minimum\r\nof clothing, usually saturated with oil, and wearing a tin hat to\r\nprotect the head from falling stones, etc. The sides of the wells\r\nare lined with impermeable clay, which is protected by wicker-work.\r\nThe man is lowered by a rope, air being supplied to him by means of\r\nbellows. At some places the rotary fan was employed more recently,\r\nbut somehow it frequently happened that it was operated in the wrong\r\ndirection, and the unfortunate digger was asphyxiated. These old wells\r\nhave a depth of about 450 feet, and though their yield of oil is not\r\nconsiderable, it has for many years been a paying proposition to those\r\nengaged in this primitive method of petroleum production. The excavated\r\nearth, when digging these wells, was brought to the surface in buckets,\r\nlowered and raised by means of either manual labour or horse traction.\r\nWhen the first oil source was reached and the extraction of the crude\r\noil commenced, this was accomplished by means of the use of wooden\r\nbuckets or leather skins, one being lowered empty while the other was\r\nraised full. By this means it was possible to raise as much as 20\r\ntons of the oil per day--quite a considerable amount, considering the\r\nprimitive means adopted.\r\n\r\nMechanical developments throughout the Roumanian oil-fields on a\r\nmore or less serious scale began about 1898, as the result of the\r\nintroduction of foreign capital, and, from that time to the present,\r\nthe history of the Roumanian petroleum industry has been one steady\r\nperiod of continued expansion. Various systems of drilling have been\r\nintroduced into the work of developing old fields or opening up new\r\ncentres, but in regard to these I shall deal at length in another\r\nchapter. The advent of the rotary method of drilling, however, opened\r\nup a new era for expansion in 1912, and since that time Roumania has\r\nmade more marked progress than at any time previously.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanian oil-fields, as at present defined, cover a region roughly\r\n20 miles in width, and extend to a length of between 300 and 400\r\nmiles, with, of course, numerous breaks. Of the numerous petroliferous\r\nregions in Roumania, those of Campina-Bustenari, Gura-Ocnitza, Moreni,\r\nand Baicoi-Tzintea among them provide about 95 per cent. of the total\r\nproduction, and, with the one exception of the Moreni field, all have\r\nbeen previously exploited by hand-dug wells.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the Roumanian industry has been directly the result\r\nof the influx of foreign capital, and the majority of the 550,000,000\r\nfrancs employed in it, is mostly made up of British, American, and\r\nGerman capital. The principal English Company in the fields is the\r\nRoumanian Consolidated Oil-fields, Ltd., which concern, with its\r\ncapital of one and three-quarter millions sterling, represents an\r\namalgamation of many small companies.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids my referring at length to the momentous happenings in\r\nthe Roumanian fields towards the end of 1916, but they will ever\r\nform one of the most interesting--and at the same time the most\r\ntragic--incidents associated with Roumania’s petroleum industry. At\r\nthat time, the German armies were pushing their way toward Roumania,\r\nand, in fact, having crossed the border, were marching on for\r\npossession not merely of territorial gains, but in order to secure\r\nthemselves of large quantities of petroleum products by capturing the\r\nprolific oil-fields of the country. It was at that critical time that\r\nthe British Government sent out its Military Mission, headed by Colonel\r\n(now Sir) John Norton Griffiths, completely to destroy all that was\r\nvaluable in connection with the oil-fields, the refineries, and the\r\ninstallations. One night the Mission arrived at the offices of the\r\nRoumanian Consolidated Oil-fields, Ltd., and made its plan of campaign\r\nclear. There was nothing to be done but to fall in with it, and the\r\nfollowing morning practically everything was destroyed, or rather, a\r\nstart was made to destroy it. And the destruction was carried out in a\r\ncomplete manner, for not only one, but several concerns which had been\r\nsteadily built up to perfection as the result of many years of careful\r\nand systematic expansion, were all wiped out, excepting in name. The\r\noil-wells were plugged beyond all hope of repair, the refineries were\r\ndismantled, machinery broken, pipe-line connections damaged, and both\r\ncrude and refined oil stocks burned. It was the most tragic proceeding\r\never recorded in oil-field history, but it was necessary, and not\r\ncarried out one day too soon, for the incoming armies were dangerously\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUSTENARI--ROUMANIA’S FAMOUS OIL REGION]\r\n\r\nThe Germans lost no time in making good a great deal of the damage to\r\nthe fields, and at the time of the armistice it was stated that the\r\ncrude oil output of Roumania was up to 80 per cent. of its pre-war\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nNow that the various allied interests are again operating in the\r\nRoumanian fields, considerable expansion of the country’s petroleum\r\nindustry is being planned, though the pre-war German interests therein\r\nare now taken over by the Allies.\r\n\r\nDuring the past decade Roumania has necessarily catered for the export\r\ntrade, for the volume of crude oil produced has been far beyond its\r\nrequirements. The great petroleum storage port of Constantza has been\r\nmade the centre for this export business, and the completion of a trunk\r\npipe-line from the Roumanian refineries to the port was one of the\r\nmost recent enterprises undertaken by the Roumanian Government prior\r\nto the war. During the period when Roumania was under German control\r\nits terminal point was so changed that the line ran to a spot which\r\nrendered the transport of petroleum to Germany a matter of ease. Now,\r\nhowever, Germany’s plans have been frustrated, and Roumania’s great\r\npipe-line will have its terminal point at Constantza, where all kinds\r\nof petroleum products can be pumped direct to the oil tankers.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH INDIES.--The growth of the petroleum industry in the Dutch\r\nIndies has been surprisingly rapid, and this growth synchronizes with\r\nthe advent of the “Shell” Company into the Far Eastern fields. It is\r\nstated that there are many hundreds of square miles of territory in\r\nthe East Indian Islands which can be remuneratively developed; at\r\nthe moment, however, though but the fringe of exploitation has been\r\ntouched, the production has been amazing. Eighteen years ago, it was\r\nplaced at 300,000 tons of crude oil; last year it nearly reached\r\n2,000,000 tons. In Sumatra several companies successfully operated\r\nfor many years, but most of them eventually became merged with the\r\nRoyal Dutch Company, whose interests now are also those of the\r\n“Shell” Company. As to Borneo, the “Shell” Company commenced active\r\ndevelopments in 1900, or thereabouts, for it had acquired an area of\r\napproximately 460 square miles. The fields rapidly responded to the\r\ndrill, and the crude oil production rose by leaps and bounds. The\r\ncrude was of a high-grade character, and for a long time it taxed the\r\nenergies of those responsible for the good conduct of the concern,\r\nas to exactly what should be done with some of the refined products.\r\nAs a matter of fact, some thousands of tons were burned, for at that\r\ntime there was little or no demand for motor spirit. I well remember\r\nwhen the Company’s Chairman--Sir Marcus Samuel--faced the shareholders\r\nin 1900 and explained that if only the Company could realize 6d. per\r\ngallon for its motor spirit, what handsome profits would accrue. But\r\nevents have marched quickly since those days. The motor-car has come\r\nto stay, and what seemed a useless product of the Far Eastern oils\r\nin the early days of development, is now one of the chief sources of\r\nrevenue. The advent of the heavier motor spirits has also been of great\r\nbenefit to the Borneo petroleum industry, for the public has grown\r\naccustomed to recognize that it is not specific gravity which counts in\r\nthe quality of motor spirit, but the closeness of the boiling points\r\nof its constituent fractions. To-day, the Far Eastern fields supply\r\nenormous quantities of refined products to the consuming markets of\r\nthe Eastern hemisphere, and so long as the supplying centres continue\r\ntheir present productivity, there need be no talk of approaching\r\nfamine, for, if necessary--providing facilities permitted--these\r\nregions could materially increase their present output of petroleum\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL PRODUCTION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INDUSTRY IN\r\nBURMAH]\r\n\r\nINDIA also ranks to-day as a very important petroleum producing\r\nregion, the fields of Upper Burmah--in which the Burmah Oil Company\r\noperates--being responsible for practically the whole production. In\r\nanother part of this little publication, I deal briefly with this\r\nCompany’s operations, so, for the moment, it is sufficient to mention\r\nthat, though to-day they produce large quantities of petroleum, there\r\nare several new districts which show much promise of new production.\r\nFor many years the Upper Burmah fields were exploited by means of very\r\nshallow wells: it was only when the deeper strata were reached that the\r\npotentialities of the region became fully manifest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD JAPANESE WAY OF OPERATING THE WELLS]\r\n\r\nJAPAN, as an oil-producing country, affords food for an interesting\r\nstory, for it was here that very early attempts were made to develop\r\nproduction. Even in the seventh century, the Emperor was presented\r\nwith “burning water” with which the Palace was lighted. The crude\r\noil was collected from pools, or, alternately, wells were dug by\r\nhand, the process of extraction being very picturesque, if very\r\nprimitive. To-day, Echigo is the centre of the industry, for which\r\nthe introduction of European methods of drilling have worked wonders\r\nin regard to progress. The Celestials consume large quantities of\r\npetroleum, especially for lighting purposes, and in spite of the now\r\nconsiderable yields from the wells, a gigantic trade is regularly done\r\nin imported oils, especially those of American origin, for which there\r\nis a most up-to-date organization for distribution. The statement that\r\nAmerican petroleum products find their way to every quarter of the\r\nglobe is strangely exemplified in Japan (as also in China), where the\r\nubiquitous tin container for petroleum can be seen in the most isolated\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GALICIAN FIELDS, SHOWING DAMAGE DONE BY THE RUSSIAN\r\nARMIES WHEN RETREATING IN 1916]\r\n\r\nGALICIA.--Since the commencement of the period when petroleum and\r\nits products assumed a degree of industrial importance, the Galician\r\noil regions have attracted considerable attention. The area of the\r\noil-fields extends over a length of 200 miles, and in width varies\r\nfrom 40 to 60 miles, and though in this territory several fields of\r\nconsiderable note have for many years been systematically developed,\r\nthere is enormous scope for future operations. Its annual output of\r\ncrude oil, which nearly reached 1,900,000 tons in 1909, is in itself\r\nsuggestive of the extensive manner in which the oil-producing fields\r\nhave been developed during late years. The oil-field history of Galicia\r\nis particularly interesting, for the oil seepages round Boryslaw have\r\nbeen exploited for very many years. Long before the introduction\r\nof the drilling methods of modern times, the shallow oil sources in\r\nthe Galician fields were tapped by means of the hand-dug wells, but\r\nit was only when the first drilled well was sunk in 1862 that the\r\nreal value of the Galician ozokerite, which abounds in many places\r\nin the oil-fields, was appreciated by the operators. This ozokerite\r\nis one of the most valuable of bitumens, and though found in several\r\ncountries, is nowhere met with in such large quantities as in Galicia.\r\nThe ozokerite there fills the fissures in the much disturbed _cpaly_,\r\nand evidently originates from a natural process of concentration. The\r\nmines are operated by modern machinery, and the industry in Galicia\r\nhas reached a stage of great importance, some thousands of tons of\r\nthe mineral being yearly raised. The material is refined, and the\r\nresulting wax serves numerous commercial purposes, the refining taking\r\nplace in the Austro-Hungarian refineries. Considerable quantities of\r\nthe raw material are exported to Germany and Russia, while the refined\r\nproducts are well known on the export markets. About seven years ago,\r\nserious water trouble materially reduced the production of the Galician\r\noil-wells (for when the water courses are not properly shut off,\r\nwater may encroach and cause the loss of the producing well), but the\r\ntrouble was to some extent surmounted by the taking of greater care in\r\ncementing the wells. The introduction and consequent popularity of the\r\nmodern drilling methods which were introduced by Mr. W. H. Margarvey\r\nin 1882 permitted the testing of the deeper horizons of the Galician\r\nfields, and to-day wells are by no means uncommon with depths up to and\r\nsometimes exceeding 4,000 feet. The Boryslaw-Tustanowice district still\r\ncontinues to be the centre of the crude oil production, but several\r\nnew oil areas with great promise have been opened up during the past\r\nsix years. Naturally, the European War has retarded development work\r\nconsiderably, and the Galician fields have on more than one occasion\r\nbeen the scene of battle. At one time in 1915 they passed over to the\r\nRussians, but when the Russian retreat occurred later from Lemberg,\r\nconsiderable damage was done to the fields in order to prevent their\r\nbeing of immediate use to the enemy. The wells were seriously damaged,\r\nand the State refinery at Drohobitz was partially dismantled, while\r\nimmense reserves of refined oil stocks were burned.\r\n\r\nThe Galician oil industry has for years attracted the attention of\r\nforeign capitalists, for the highly remunerative nature of petroleum\r\nexploitation is generally appreciated. Prior to the European war\r\nGerman capital was very largely interested in the Galician industry,\r\nand the majority of Allied companies had Germans as their local\r\nrepresentatives, but all this is now changed, and in the future Allied\r\ncapital will be considerably increased. The Premier Company is the\r\nlargest English concern in the Galician fields.\r\n\r\nGERMANY has made great endeavours in the past to institute a petroleum\r\nindustry of its own, but no great success has been recorded, for while\r\nit does possess several oil-producing areas, these are only small\r\nfields, with a very limited yield of heavy petroleums. The wells,\r\nthough producing for many years steadily, do not give forth those large\r\nquantities of petroleum so characteristic of the best wells in other\r\npetroleum-producing fields, and flowing wells are indeed very rare.\r\nGermany, therefore, has to look to imported petroleum for its large\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nIn a succeeding chapter I refer at length to those oil regions which\r\ncome within the limits of a chapter, “Petroleum in the British\r\nEmpire”: there is no need at the moment to make reference to them here.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit my even briefly touching upon the many other oil\r\nregions of the world which are now being successfully operated; it is\r\ncertain, however, as time goes on that their number will be materially\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW PETROLEUM IS PRODUCED\r\n\r\n\r\nTime was when the engineering aspect of the production of petroleum\r\nwas practically non-existent. The ancients, and even those of the last\r\ncentury, were content to resort to the most primitive means for winning\r\npetroleum from the earth. Shallow wells were sunk or dug by hand, the\r\neventual securing of the oil being carried out by lowering primitive\r\nreceptacles (generally leather bottles) into the hole. It was a period\r\nlong before the advent of the Oil Age, and the methods employed were\r\nclearly in keeping with the mode of life of that day. In practically\r\nevery oil-producing field of the world--though in this respect the\r\nUnited States is almost an exception--the history records the fact that\r\nfor many years the extraction of oil from the ground was confined to\r\nthe use of the primitive methods which held sway in those days--those\r\nassociated with the operations of the hand-dug wells. In the Far East,\r\nnotably in Japan, we find the first serious attempts to obtain and\r\nutilize petroleum, for as far back as A.D. 615, there were shallow\r\nwells in existence, from which the “burning water,” as it was called,\r\nwas collected. In Roumania and Russia, too, the earlier attempts to\r\ncreate a petroleum industry were confined to these methods.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the demand for petroleum became large and consistently\r\nincreased with the opening up of new fields, that we find other and\r\nmore practical methods were introduced for winning larger quantities\r\nof the oil from the earth. To-day, in every branch of the industry\r\nassociated with petroleum--whether it be in producing the crude\r\noil, in transporting it, or in refining Nature’s product into those\r\nnumerous commodities which are part and parcel of everyday life--the\r\nengineering aspect is one of very great importance. In fact, throughout\r\nthe petroleum industry, engineering science is the Alpha and Omega. By\r\nits means we are now able to carefully study the nature of the ground\r\nat depths of 6,000 feet, and to extract from the deep lying strata a\r\nwealth of minerals; we are able, too, to transport thousands of tons of\r\ncrude oil daily across thousands of miles of continent, while is it not\r\nthe direct result of engineering science which allows over 15,000 tons\r\nof petroleum products to be carried across the oceans of the world in\r\none vessel with the same ease that one would take a rowing boat from\r\none side of a lake to another?\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as have been the degrees of progress recorded in\r\nconnection with drilling for petroleum, the old methods, generally\r\nspeaking, and which date back to the days of early China, are still\r\nlargely copied in all pole and percussion systems of drilling, and\r\nthough steam has replaced manual labour (and electricity now bids\r\nfair to replace steam), the operating principles to-day are the same\r\nas then. The only exception, of course, is the advent and growing\r\npopularity of the rotary method of drilling, to which interesting phase\r\nof the subject I will briefly refer later.\r\n\r\nThe old Eastern method of drilling has obviously been the forerunner\r\nof the Canadian, standard, and other systems of to-day, the wire rope\r\nreplacing the use of poles. In oil-field work, the principal types\r\nof percussion drills used are known (1) as the Pennsylvanian cable,\r\n(2) the Canadian pole, and (3) the Russian free-fall system, and\r\nthough from time to time many attempts have been made to introduce\r\nmodifications of these, the vast majority have been unsuccessful in\r\ntheir operation.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian cable system was used for drilling the earliest\r\noil-wells in the United States, and doubtless took its name from the\r\nfact that it was so largely used in that oil region. As may also be\r\ngathered from the name, the principal feature in this system is the\r\ncable by which the tools are suspended and connected to the walking\r\nbeam. There is no doubt that this system of drilling, which has been so\r\nuniversally used in the oil-fields, gives most satisfactory results.\r\nWhen first introduced in Pennsylvania, the cable system of drilling\r\nwas particularly simple, and did remarkably good work, for the reason\r\nthat the strata usually encountered was of such a nature that it did\r\nnot cave, and, as a result, the well-pipe was only lowered when the\r\nfull depth of that string had been drilled. The drilling bits were\r\nseldom more than 4 inches thick. In order to give a rotary motion to\r\nthe bit, the continuous twisting of the cable to and fro was necessary;\r\nbut when in other fields, where deeper strata had to be explored, the\r\ncable system was introduced, the semi-sandy nature of the strata called\r\nfor wells of larger diameter with correspondingly larger drilling\r\nbits. As a consequence of the additional weight of the drilling bit,\r\nit was found that the swing of the tools was sufficient to give them a\r\nrotating movement for the drilling of a circular hole. In regions where\r\ncaving-in of the walls of the wells was liable to occur, the string of\r\npipe had to closely follow the tools, which, with the old Pennsylvanian\r\ntype of rig, meant frequent winding of the cable from the bull wheel,\r\nso as to allow of the well pipes being handled.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the waste of time which these operations\r\noccasioned, the calf wheel was added, by means of which the pipe could\r\nbe lowered into the hole without the removal of the drilling cable.\r\nThis cable almost invariably was of the Manila character, and in many\r\ninstances this rope is retained to-day, though wire ropes have been\r\nintroduced frequently.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian pole system, which is largely in use in oil-field\r\noperations, is, like the first-mentioned method of drilling, of the\r\npercussion type, the chief essential difference being that, instead of\r\na cable connecting the tools to the surface, poles are used. In former\r\ntimes, these poles were of ash-wood, but with the extended use of the\r\nsystem, iron rods took their place. The introduction of these iron rods\r\nwas a distinct advantage, for they could be welded to whatever lengths\r\nare required, whereas the wooden poles, which were seldom more than\r\n20 feet long, had to be spliced for practical work. The rig used with\r\nthe Canadian system is not so powerful as that for the Pennsylvanian\r\nmethod, but the one great advantage of the Canadian system is that,\r\nfor the drilling of shallow oil-wells, it could be operated by men of\r\nless experience. The success which has attended the operation of the\r\npole system lies in the fact that although drilling by its means is\r\nvery slow--for seldom is 250 feet per month exceeded--it is one of the\r\nbest methods of drilling through complicated strata, and, in the hands\r\nof conscientious men, does highly satisfactory work. It might be of\r\ninterest to very briefly refer to the operations of the system when\r\na well is being drilled. The rig (that is, the superstructure above\r\nground) is quite a simple framing, 70 or more feet high, with a base\r\nof about 20 feet. The power is usually derived from a steam engine,\r\nwith the usual means for operating the gear from the derrick; fuel\r\nfound locally, natural gas, or other form of heating agent used. One\r\nshaft and two spools running in bearings transmit the various motions\r\ndesired, the drive being taken up by a pulley attached to the main\r\nshaft. On this shaft are keyed two band pulleys, which communicate by\r\nbelting with two spools running immediately overhead in the upper part\r\nof the framework. Fastened to one extremity of the main shaft is a\r\ndisc crank, which, through the medium of a connecting rod, transmits\r\nan oscillating movement to an overhead pivoted walking beam. In all\r\nsystems of percussion drilling, the drilling bit is raised and then\r\ndropped a distance of several feet, the result being that the strata to\r\nbe drilled are steadily pounded away. As the ground is pulverized by\r\nthe percussion tools, the debris has to be cleared away so as to enable\r\nthe drill to fall freely and to deliver clean blows to the unbroken\r\nstrata, and this work is performed by appliances known as bailers and\r\nsand pumps. There is no need for me to go into the numerous technical\r\ndetails regarding this or any other system of drilling, for my only\r\ndesire is to give a general impression as to the usual methods adopted\r\nfor the winning of petroleum.\r\n\r\nI will therefore pass on to deal briefly with the Russian free-fall\r\nsystem so much in vogue in the Russian fields. Incidentally, I may\r\nhere say that when drilling for oil in Russia, one has to recollect\r\nseveral features which are not common to the development of other\r\noil-fields. Bearing in mind the great depth to which wells have to be\r\nsunk to reach the prolific oil horizons in the majority of the fields\r\nin Russia, which necessitates starting the well with a very large\r\ndiameter--frequently 30 inches--it will be easily appreciated that the\r\nloss of a hole in the course of drilling is a very expensive affair.\r\nThe Russian free-fall system of boring necessitates patient and hard\r\nmanual labour. It is, as its name implies, of the percussion type, and\r\nis, in fact, a modified pole-tool system which well suits the local\r\nconditions. The clumsy drilling tools have a practically free drop,\r\nbeing picked up when the walking beam is at its lowest point, and\r\nreleased at the top of the stroke. When released, the tools naturally\r\nforce their way downwards in the strata, and are released only with\r\ndifficulty, although in a measure this difficulty is minimized on\r\naccount of the fact that the under-reaming (slightly enlarging the\r\ndiameter of the hole) is done simultaneously with the drilling.\r\n\r\nAfter a Russian well has been started by means of a slip-hook\r\nsuspended from a haulage rope, and a depth of some 30 feet obtained,\r\nthe free-fall is added to the string of tools. This free-fall is\r\ncomposed of two separate parts--the rod and the body--and these are\r\nheld together by means of a wedge working in vertical slots cut in the\r\nsides of the body. In operating the free-fall, the handles, fixed to\r\nthe temper screw, are held by the driller. On the downward stroke these\r\nare pushed forward from right to left, but as soon as the downward\r\nstroke is completed, they are quickly pulled backwards. The steel\r\nwedge enters the recess and the tools are carried to the top of the\r\nstroke, where, by a quick forward jerk, the wedge is thrown clear of\r\nthe recess, and the tools drop freely, the momentum of the string of\r\ntools driving the drilling bit deeper into the hole. After several feet\r\nof the hole are drilled, the tools have to be withdrawn in order to\r\nallow the pulverized mass of debris to be cleared away, while, owing to\r\nthe caving nature of the strata, it is necessary to case the well as\r\ndrilling proceeds.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the system is very cumbersome, but, in the hands of\r\nexperienced men, it does its work well, if but slowly. There are many\r\ncases on record where, when the well has assumed a considerable depth,\r\nit has been completely spoiled by the carelessness of the operators,\r\nbut, more often than not, this has been deliberate, for the Caucasian\r\noil-field worker has many grievances, admittedly more or less imaginary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATION OF THE “OILWELL” HEAVY ROTARY OUTFIT,\r\nSHOWING RING AND WEDGE (ON LEFT-HAND SIDE OF FOREGROUND) TO GRIP THE\r\nCASING]\r\n\r\nDuring recent years, the rotary method of drilling has been\r\nsuccessfully adopted, and it is in regard to this revolutionary method\r\nof speedy drilling that I will now touch upon. The rotary method of\r\ndrilling made its début in Texas some fourteen years ago, and since\r\nthen it is not any exaggeration to say that nearly 20,000 wells for oil\r\nhave been drilled with the system, which has found popularity in all\r\nthe oil-fields of the world. Its main operation is simplicity itself: a\r\nrigid stem of heavy pipe rotates a fish-tail drilling bit at the bottom\r\nof the hole, cutting and stirring up the formation to be drilled. It\r\ncuts its way through the underground formations, much in the same way\r\nas a screw when rotated forces its way through wood. It is the essence\r\nof speed in drilling, for, unlike the necessary principles to be\r\nadopted in the percussion methods of drilling, the rotary drill does\r\nnot have to be lifted from the hole for the purposes of clearing. The\r\npulverized strata are continuously washed from the hole by a stream of\r\nwater reaching the bottom of the drill. Very frequently, a pressure-fed\r\nmud is used, and this serves a double purpose, for in its return to\r\nthe surface it tends to plaster the walls of the well. The mud emerges\r\nin streams of high velocity from the two apertures in the drilling bit\r\n(for in its downward course it is carried through the drilling pipe or\r\nstem), but naturally loses this velocity considerably in its return to\r\nthe surface. It is, however, very easy to detect the kind of stratum\r\nbeing drilled through from the returned cuttings, these reaching the\r\nsurface but a few minutes after the drilling bit has entered the\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time various grievances have been ventilated against this\r\nimproved system of boring for petroleum, but to-day its adoption is\r\nworld-wide, and by its use wells which, with the old-fashioned method\r\nof drilling would take many months if not two or three years, are now\r\ngot down to the producing horizons in but a few weeks. It is, in fact,\r\nsolely due to the ever-increasing use of the rotary drill that the\r\nuniversally increased demands for petroleum products have been met by\r\nan ever-increasing production of the crude oil.\r\n\r\nLeaving the question of drilling methods, I cannot fail to mention\r\nthe interesting fact that in oil-field operations progress is now\r\nbeing recorded in another direction, and that is by the increasing\r\nutilization of electrical power in the place of steam. At the time\r\nof writing, it is safe to say that fully 60 per cent. of the power\r\nrequirements on the oil-fields is provided for by steam plants,\r\nwith their attendant waste. Oil and gas engines, with their greater\r\nefficiency, may claim to be operated to an extent of 35 per cent.,\r\nwhile not more than 5 per cent. of the requirements are satisfied\r\nby the use of electric motors. There is no doubt that prejudice has\r\nhad a deal to do with the very minimized use of electrical power on\r\nthe oil-fields in the past, but this is being gradually swept aside,\r\nand, in the next few years, I have no doubt that both electrical\r\nmanufacturers and the petroleum industry generally will materially\r\nbenefit from the use of this cheap and very economical form of power.\r\nIn the past, many disastrous oil-field conflagrations have been due\r\nsolely to the use of open-fired engines in close proximity to the\r\nwells, but with the use of electrical energy this fire danger will be\r\nrapidly removed.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter, I would say a word or two with respect to\r\nthe bringing into the producing stage of the oil-wells when once they\r\nhave been drilled. In the early history of oil-held developments,\r\nit was not infrequent to find the crude oil ejected from the well\r\nby natural pressure, but to-day it is the exception to find those\r\noil-fountains which have made the early history of the Russian\r\noil-fields so famous. In many of the fields, explosives are used to\r\npromote the flow of oil, and when the well “comes in” to production,\r\nthe ordinary methods of bailing or pumping are resorted to. Compressed\r\nair is also used for bringing about and sustaining production. The\r\nquantity of air and the periods of admission naturally vary with\r\nthe diameters of the wells, the amount of gas present, the level of\r\nthe liquid, etc., which latter also determines the pressure of air\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe natural exhaustion of oil-wells can obviously have no remedy, but\r\nareas conveying that impression can often be revived by methods, the\r\nstudy of which is being carefully continued. As I write, I find that\r\nthe officials of the United States Bureau of Mines, who have been\r\nstudying this question of exhaustion, have arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat from 20 to as much as 90 per cent. of the crude oil remains in\r\nthe strata tapped by the well, even when it is abandoned as no longer\r\ncapable of profitable production. This conclusion opens up what may\r\nprove some day to be a most interesting chapter in oil-field history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE REFINING OF PETROLEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the aim of this little volume is to interest other than\r\nthose who are directly associated with the petroleum industry, I shall\r\nendeavour in this chapter to refer to the refining of petroleum in a\r\nmanner which shall be readily understood by the reader, and shall,\r\nwherever possible, refrain from entering into those highly technical\r\nmatters which do not lend themselves to popular expression.\r\n\r\nThe refining of crude oil as it is produced from the earth, consists in\r\nthe classification of its various hydrocarbons by means of fractional\r\ndistillation, into the various products which so largely enter into our\r\ncommercial and domestic life of to-day. The refined products, in the\r\norder in which they are received by distillation, are: motor spirit,\r\nilluminating oils, solar oils, lubricating oils, fuel oils, residuum,\r\netc.--the first mentioned being the lightest and the last the heaviest\r\nin specific gravity.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the discovery of petroleum, there sprung up\r\nthe first attempts to refine Nature’s product, and though these early\r\nexperiments were of a most primitive character, they doubtless served\r\ntheir purpose admirably. In this respect, probably the most primitive\r\noil refinery in the world was built near the Tigris, in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nCrude petroleum varies in its character, for while certain crudes\r\nare pale in colour and almost transparent, others are almost black\r\nand viscid. Some, indeed, would appear to have undergone a course of\r\nrefining by Nature itself, for in some fields the crude oil will\r\nfreely burn in lamps without any refining treatment: in the vast\r\nmajority of cases, however, the crude oil, as withdrawn from the\r\nproducing wells, represents a liquid somewhat like molten tar.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of petroleum consists essentially of carbon\r\nand hydrogen, together with oxygen and varying amounts of nitrogen\r\nand sulphur. The crude from Pennsylvania--and this is the finest\r\ncrude in the United States--consists chiefly of a large number of\r\nhydrocarbons of the paraffin series, whilst in the Russian petroleums,\r\nthe predominant constituents are naphthenes or polymethylenes. Then\r\nthe crude petroleum of the Dutch Indies and Burmah is of a different\r\ncharacter from that found elsewhere, for in it aromatic hydrocarbons\r\nare largely present. The various series of hydrocarbons found in\r\ncrude oils--the paraffins and naphthenes--readily lend themselves to\r\nconversion into other compounds of carbon and hydrogen by dissociation,\r\nand this conversion produces compounds of higher volatility, such as\r\nmotor spirits, etc. When the compounds of hydrogen and carbon are\r\nsubmitted to distillation, certain chemical changes occur, as the\r\nresult of which other series of hydrocarbons are formed, and, though it\r\nis not my intention here to dive into this comparatively new realm of\r\nchemical investigation, it is interesting to mention that, by carrying\r\nthe treatment of the compounds still further, it is possible to obtain\r\naromatic hydrocarbons, including trinitrotoluene (generally known as\r\nthe explosive T.N.T.), in addition to various dye products.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier methods of refining, the stills usually consisted of\r\na vertical cylinder in which the charge of crude oil was distilled\r\nalmost to dryness, but this method was completely revolutionized many\r\nyears ago, especially in the United States, by the introduction and\r\nimmediate success of a principle known as the “cracking” process, and\r\nby the separation of the distillation into two portions, one for the\r\nremoval of the more volatile constituents in the crude oil (such as\r\nmotor spirit) and the other for the treatment of the heavier products.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                          CRUDE OIL\r\n\r\n                                                                    FRACTIONAL

DISTILLATION\r\n\r\nI will first deal with the method of refining known as the “straight”\r\nprocess, or the process which does not involve “cracking.” At one time,\r\nthe refiner had to consider the saleability of his refined products\r\nbefore he commenced to refine them, but to-day, with the perfect system\r\nwhich prevails for the handling of huge quantities of refined products,\r\nand the transporting of them to the most distant markets, the one\r\ndesire of the refiner is, naturally, to secure from his treatment of\r\nthe crude oil, as many refined products as possible, always keeping an\r\neye on the production of the largest quantities of the higher priced\r\nproducts than upon those which are of low value.\r\n\r\nThe process of refining to be applied to any particular oil naturally\r\ndepends upon its composition as shown by analysis. It may be that the\r\ncrude oil to be treated, apart from containing a small percentage of\r\ndistillates with a low boiling point (motor spirit), is principally\r\nmade up of residues of little value except as fuel, or, on the other\r\nhand, it may be that the crude oil is of high quality and contains all\r\npossible products. In the former case, the process of distillation is\r\nbrief, and the plant inexpensive, as compared with the lengthy process\r\nof full refining necessitated in the latter case.\r\n\r\nThe refining operations consist of three distinct branches: (1) the\r\ndistillation, (2) the extracting of paraffin and refining, and (3)\r\nthe chemical treatment. When only a small percentage of the low\r\nboiling fractions has to be removed from the crude oil, the process\r\nis known as “topping,” and a convenient form of apparatus for the\r\npurpose is the tower still. This consists of a vertical cylinder\r\nfitted with perforated plates resting at intervals on pipes through\r\nwhich superheated steam travels. The pipes serve the double purpose\r\nof conveying the steam to its inlet and of heating the oil to be\r\ndistilled. The steam, on entering the cylinder, ascends, meeting the\r\ncrude oil, as it descends from plate to plate in a regulated stream,\r\nand carrying with it to the outlet the light fractions which the\r\noperation is intended to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                        CRUDE OIL\r\n\r\n

“CRACKING”\r\nPROCESS\r\n\r\nA few years ago, a Californian chemist invented an improvement of the\r\nprinciples of maximum heating and evaporating surfaces. His name was\r\nTrumble, and the process is known as the Trumble process. The crude\r\noil is heated to the desired temperature in pipes or retorts set in a\r\nprimary furnace, the hot gases of combustion from which are utilized to\r\nheat the distillation chamber proper. Entering the vertical cylinder at\r\nthe top, the oil is spread over and through perforated plates falling\r\non a cone-shaped plate to divert the continuous stream of oil to the\r\nsides of the still, down which it flows in a thin film. Other conical\r\nplates, arranged at intervals underneath, maintain the flow in the\r\ndesired channel until it reaches the outlet at the bottom. When 60 or\r\n70 per cent. (comprising the motor spirit series, the kerosenes, and\r\nperhaps the intermediate fractions) are to be removed, it is common\r\npractice to distil the crude oil in a series of stills, cylindrical in\r\nshape, connected continuously. The best-known system is that patented\r\n35 years ago by Mr. Henderson, of the Broxburn Oil Company, Ltd., for\r\nthe distillation of shale oil, and since adopted by many refiners of\r\npetroleum. In this system, the crude oil flows from a charging tank by\r\ngravity through a pre-heater, heated by the passage, from the second or\r\nother still, of distillates of suitable temperature, and thence into\r\nthe first still. Here it is raised to distillation temperature, and the\r\nspecific gravity of the distillate therefrom fixed. The feed of the\r\ncrude oil is constant, the residue formed in the still passing through\r\na connection at the bottom into the second still in the series, at the\r\ntop, and led from back to front so that the inlet and outlet shall be\r\nas far apart as possible. It is here raised to a higher temperature,\r\nyielding a distillate of higher specific gravity, the residue passing\r\non to the next still, and so on through the series of stills until it\r\nreaches the point where all the motor spirit (or benzine, as it is\r\ncalled), kerosene, and the intermediate distillates are removed.\r\n\r\nThe distillates obtained from the refining of the crude are usually\r\npurified by treatment successively with sulphuric acid and solution of\r\ncaustic soda, this process of chemical treatment being necessary before\r\nthe products are fit for the market.\r\n\r\nThe “cracking” process of distillation briefly consists in distilling\r\nthe oils at a temperature higher than the normal boiling points of\r\nthe constituents it is desired to decompose, and, in practice, the\r\nresult is that the heavier oils are turned into lighter hydrocarbons\r\nof lower boiling points: thus the yield of the more valuable of the\r\nrefined products is materially increased. The “cracking” process,\r\nwhich very largely obtains to-day, was quite accidentally discovered\r\nby a small refiner in America many years ago. The man in charge of the\r\nstill left it with the intention of returning very shortly. He was,\r\nhowever, absent for several hours, and to his dismay found that; as the\r\nresult of his neglect in attending to the still, a very light coloured\r\ndistillate of much lower density than that which it was usual to\r\nobtain, was issuing from the condenser.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it was found that a portion of the distillate\r\nhad condensed upon the upper part of the still, which was cooler,\r\nand had dropped back into the still, where the temperature was\r\nsufficient to produce products of a lower boiling point--certainly\r\na distinct improvement. As may be imagined, this “cracking” process\r\ndoes not commence until the lighter products of distillation have been\r\nremoved, and is now so popular because by its use a greater yield can\r\nbe obtained of those more valuable products for which there is an\r\never-increasing demand.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to enter into those various improvements which\r\nhave been introduced from time to time, all of which have as their\r\naim the production of larger quantities of refined oils, and it would\r\nlikewise be invidious to enumerate even the more popular scientists to\r\nwhose energies much of the resulting progress has been due, for the\r\nsimple reason that it has ever been the aim of the petroleum chemist to\r\nturn his abilities in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, the industry of petroleum refining has had to adapt\r\nitself to the altered conditions of to-day. For instance, prior to the\r\nadvent of the internal combustion engine, which now is responsible\r\nfor such a wide application of motor spirit, the demand for this,\r\nthe lightest product of petroleum distillation, was non-existent.\r\nConsequently, when such spirit was produced, there was no market for\r\nit, and its production represented sheer loss to the refiners. Both\r\nin the Far East and in Russia, we have examples of the enormous loss\r\nwhich accrued to the refiners by reason of there being no market\r\nfor this highly inflammable product. In the Far Eastern fields, in\r\nparticular, this loss was very heavy, for in the earlier days of its\r\noperations, the “Shell” Company had to remove thousands of tons of\r\nthis now valuable motor spirit from its refineries and burn it in the\r\nopen fields. The successful introduction of the internal combustion\r\nengine, however, completely changed the aspect of petroleum refining,\r\nand the desire became general, not to see how little motor spirit could\r\nbe produced, but to perfect methods by which the yield of the benzene\r\nseries of hydrocarbons should be as large as possible. Even to-day\r\nprogress is still being recorded in this direction, and each American\r\nrefiner is vying with his neighbour as to how far that output of\r\ngasoline, as it is there called, can be increased.\r\n\r\nMany and varied are the means which have been resorted to for this\r\npurpose, but most of them have reference to improvements in the\r\nprocesses for refining the crude oil. One, however, is worthy of being\r\nmentioned in this little treatise, inasmuch as it deals with quite\r\nanother aspect of the problem of increased motor spirit supply.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned in another chapter, enormous quantities of natural\r\ngas exude from the oil-wells, and this in the past has been for the\r\nmost part allowed to go to waste in the air, causing an ever-present\r\ndanger to oil-field operations on account of its liability to ignite.\r\nBeing heavier than the air itself, for it is impregnated with oil\r\ngases, it remains for long periods in the lower air strata, and,\r\nconsequently, not infrequently, has been the direct cause of great\r\noil-field fires. This gas--casing-head gas, as it is termed--comes from\r\nthe oil-wells between the casing and the tubing, and, in the case of\r\nnumerous wells, the flow is remarkable, some wells giving forth 300,000\r\ncubic feet of gas every 24 hours, and the only useful purpose that this\r\nvapour has served until recent years has been to light several towns\r\nsituated comparatively near to the oil-producing fields. The great\r\nvolume of the gas, however, has been allowed to go to waste.\r\n\r\nBut experiments have proved that the gas is capable of condensation\r\ninto motor spirit, and the general yield of such spirit may be taken\r\nas fully 2 gallons per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas treated. What\r\nwonderful possibilities lie in the direction of the conversion of this\r\nvapour into motor spirit! The oil-producers in the United States have\r\nnot been slow to appreciate this, and to-day there are hundreds of\r\nplants in the United States which have been erected solely to condense\r\nthese oil-well gas vapours. Some of these plants are dealing with as\r\nmuch as 3,000,000 cubic feet of gas a day. The most recent official\r\nreturns available from the United States show that the production of\r\ngasoline (motor spirit) from this process of oil gas condensation is,\r\napproximately, 150,000,000 gallons per annum, and even this substantial\r\nfigure is being steadily increased.\r\n\r\nThere is also another phase of the oil-refining industry which, during\r\nrecent years, has materially altered. I refer to the production of\r\nsolar oil during distillation. It is an apt saying that we can scarcely\r\nlook to any section of our commercial or domestic life without being\r\nconfronted with the fact that oil products play some part therein:\r\nthere are few, however, who, without reflection, would agree that when\r\nthey light their gas they are dependent upon petroleum for much of the\r\nlight the gas gives. It is, nevertheless, a fact, as I will proceed to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, the oil refiners in Baku were confronted with a\r\nproblem which appeared for some time to be insurmountable. After the\r\ndistillation of their kerosene, or illuminating oil, and before they\r\ncould commence to take off the lubricating oil fractions, there was an\r\nintermediary product which, while being of no use for lamp oil, did not\r\npossess the necessary constituents of viscosity to make it acceptable\r\nas a lubricant. It was a fairly decent volume of something for which\r\nthere was no market at the time.\r\n\r\nExperiments were made, and with these the name of Dr. Paul Dvorkovitz\r\nwill ever be associated, and it was found that by the passage of a\r\ncurrent of gas over the surface of this intermediate product, the gas\r\ncaught up as it were a richness which materially increased the lighting\r\npower of the gas. To cut a long, but highly interesting, story short,\r\nthis solar or gas oil was subsequently introduced by Dr. Dvorkovitz to\r\nEngland for gas enrichment purposes, and the extent of its employment\r\nto-day may be judged from the fact that the United Kingdom regularly\r\nimports between 60,000,000 and 70,000,000 gallons per annum for the\r\nenrichment of the coal gas which finds useful employment in practically\r\nevery home throughout the land. As is known, the gas companies have to\r\nproduce gas of a certain lighting quality, and it is in the upholding\r\nof the lighting strength of the gas that solar oil to-day plays so\r\nimportant a part. At first, the oil came almost exclusively from\r\nRussia, but now the competition from the United States has secured\r\nfor our American friends the vast bulk of the trade, which, as I have\r\nshown, has reached enormous proportions.\r\n\r\nSolar oil is also largely utilized for the production of refined\r\nperfumery oils, which are quite colourless and inodorous, while the\r\nfinest quality is used in pharmacy and known as _paraffinum liquidum_,\r\nand is in much demand, but in this connection it is the Russian\r\npetroleums that have gained distinction. It was held for many years\r\nthat such tasteless and colourless oils could not be produced from the\r\nUnited States petroleums, but from the commencement of the European\r\nWar, and the consequent closure of Russia’s export port, whereby all\r\noverseas trade in Russian petroleums was held up, much progress was\r\nmade in the manufacture of tasteless medicinal petroleums in the United\r\nStates, such articles having now become popular throughout the world.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important discoveries made during recent years has\r\nbeen the finding of large quantities of toluol in petroleum. This\r\narticle is necessary for the manufacture of high explosives. In Borneo\r\nheavy petroleum, toluol exists to a very large extent, and it was its\r\ndiscovery and consequent use by the allies--thanks to the offer made\r\nto the Governments by Sir Marcus Samuel, Bart.--that almost unlimited\r\nquantities of high explosives were manufactured.\r\n\r\nVaseline is another useful commodity which is derived from the refining\r\nof crude petroleum, and this article is turned out of the American\r\nrefineries as well as those of Russia and Galicia, in large quantities,\r\nbut, beyond mentioning this fact, no useful purpose would here be\r\nserved by relating the various processes employed.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the methods generally adopted in the refining of the\r\nproducts from the distillation of the Scottish oil shales, these are\r\nbriefly dealt with in the chapter devoted to the Scottish oil industry.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the past two or three decades have witnessed\r\nmarked progress in perfecting the methods by which crude petroleums are\r\nrefined into the innumerable common commodities of commerce, and it\r\nis doubtful whether in any branch of chemical research there has been\r\nsuch concerted energy shown as in regard to the refining of mineral\r\noils. Signs, however, are not wanting to show that the zenith of this\r\nprogress has by no means been reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT BY LAND AND SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarkably perfect methods by which petroleum and its products\r\nare transported by land and sea before they reach the consumer may\r\nnot at first sight appear to be anything but commonplace, but a\r\nmoment’s reflection will be sufficient to suggest that a vast and\r\ncomplete organization must be required in order that petroleum may be\r\nbrought from practically the ends of the earth to the consumer in the\r\nmost remote village in the British Isles. But it is the demands of\r\nnecessity that have been responsible for the building up of this vast\r\norganization of transportation which represents, in the United States\r\nalone, the investment of many millions of pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nTaking first the methods of oil transportation by land, in no other\r\noil-producing country do we find such an elaborate system for dealing\r\nwith enormous quantities of petroleum as in America, for it is safe to\r\nsay that at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil have to be dealt with\r\ndaily at the present time.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the time when petroleum first became a commercial\r\ncommodity--when the first wells in Oil Creek commenced to open up\r\na period of new prosperity for the United States--these wells were\r\nsituated so close to the water that their product could easily be\r\nloaded into canoes and barges, and floated down the Alleghany river. In\r\nthe dry season, the flow was insufficient to float the craft, and then\r\nsome hundreds of the boats, carrying each from 50 to 1,000 barrels,\r\nwould be assembled in a mill-pond near the wells, and the water\r\nimpounded while the loading was in progress. Then the gates would be\r\nopened, and the fleet, carried on the flood of rushing water, would\r\nbe hurried down the river in charge of pilots. The fleet of creek and\r\nriver boats engaged in this novel work at one time numbered 2,000.\r\n\r\nBut, as the production of oil increased, and new districts were\r\nsuccessfully tapped, it became obvious that some different method of\r\nhandling the crude oil would have to be adopted. The inland wells\r\ncould not get rid of their production, and it is not surprising to\r\nfind that at one time--about 1862--crude oil prices at the well fell\r\nto 10 cents per barrel. A system of horse haulage was initiated, and\r\nin time thousands of animals were required to haul the oil from the\r\ninland wells to shipping points. The waggon train of the oil country\r\nin the pre-pipe-line days at its maximum consisted of 6,000 two-horse\r\nteams and waggons, and a traveller in the oil region in those early\r\nsixties could not lose sight of an endless train of waggons each laden\r\nwith from five to seven barrels. The roads were almost bottomless, and\r\nthe teamsters tore down fences and drove where they liked. These men,\r\nalways of the roving, picturesque type, would earn anything from 10 to\r\n25 dollars per day, spending the most part in revelry on the Saturday\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that a Bill was introduced into the States\r\nlegislature authorizing the construction of a pipe-line from Oil\r\nCreek to a spot known as Kittanning, but the opposition of 4,000\r\nteamsters defeated the Bill and the first effort to organize an oil\r\npipe-line company. The modest beginning of the present-day system of\r\noil transportation on land by pipe-line was due to the enterprise of\r\na Jerseyman named Hutchings, who laid a 2-inch pipe from some wells\r\nto the Humbolt refinery. The teamsters, foreseeing the possibilities\r\nof this innovation, proceeded to tear up the line, and warned the\r\noil-producers not to adopt these new methods of oil transportation.\r\n\r\nBut Hutchings was undismayed, for he laid a second line, this being\r\ncomposed of cast-iron joints caulked with lead. Although this\r\nwas impracticable, the teamsters again wrought vengeance on the\r\nproposition, and completely destroyed it. Hutchings still persisted in\r\nhis efforts, but died--disappointed and penniless--a genius living a\r\nlittle before his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRIMITIVE METHOD OF TRANSPORTING OIL]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1865, a Henry Harley commenced the laying of a pipe-line\r\nto the terminus of the Oil Creek railroad, but teamsters cut the pipes,\r\nburned the collecting tanks, and retarded the work in every possible\r\nway. Armed guards eventually came on the scene, the mob was quelled and\r\ndispersed, and the line completed. It was of 2-inch diameter, and laid\r\nto handle 800 barrels of oil daily: this was the first successful and\r\nprofitable pipe-line on record for the handling of oil.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the number of pipe-lines have multiplied, until to-day\r\nthere are thousands of them scattered throughout every oil-producing\r\nfield of America. The first long main transportation line for oil\r\nwas laid in 1880 from Butler County to Cleveland, a distance of over\r\n100 miles, and immediately after its completion, trunk lines were\r\ncommenced from the Bradford oil region to the Atlantic seaboard. The\r\npopularity of this new method of oil transportation may be judged from\r\nthe fact that within three years from the completion of these first\r\npropositions, the National Transit Company possessed over 3,000 miles\r\nof oil pipe-lines, and had iron tank storage for 35,000,000 barrels of\r\ncrude oil.\r\n\r\nThen a few master minds came to the front, and loyally supported by\r\nMr. John D. Rockefeller, of Standard Oil fame, they undertook the\r\nherculean task of practically girdling the States with a system of oil\r\npipe-lines that has no parallel anywhere. They eliminated the jaded\r\nhorses, oil-boats, wooden tankage, and slow freights, tedious methods,\r\nand questionable practices of handling petroleum, and substituted\r\ntherefor the stem pump, the iron conduit, the steel tank storage, and\r\nsystematic and businesslike methods which soon commanded the confidence\r\nand respect of all oil-producers. They extended their pipe-lines to\r\npractically every producing well and established a transportation\r\nsystem which serves the industry to-day as no other on earth is\r\nserved. The advantages of the modern pipe-line to the oil-producer are\r\nobvious. A pipe-line connection to a producer’s tank ensures prompt\r\nservice and a cash market for his product at all times. The small line\r\nconnected with his tank conveys the crude oil therefrom, either by\r\ngravity or by means of a pump, into a receiving tank of the gathering\r\nor field lines of the pipe-line system, from which it is pumped into\r\nthe main trunk pipe-lines to the refineries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL PIPE-LINE CONNECTIONS IN THE AMERICAN FIELDS]\r\n\r\nThe system by which the producer can have payment for his oil at\r\nany time, for he is credited with its value when it once enters the\r\npipe-line, is the perfection of simplicity, accuracy, and efficiency.\r\nThe pipe-line of which the gathering or field lines are composed varies\r\nin diameter from 2 to 8 inches, the joints of which are screw threaded.\r\nThe main trunk lines are from 6 to 10 inches in diameter, and pumping\r\nstations, supplied with powerful plant driven by steam or internal\r\ncombustion engines of the Diesel type, are located at suitable points\r\nof the line. According to the nature of the crude oils to be passed\r\nthrough the pipe-line must the erection of pumping houses be governed:\r\nfor instance, in handling the heavy Californian or Mexican crudes, the\r\npumping stations have to be much nearer each other than when a lighter\r\ncrude oil is transported. Some of the heavier oils have, in fact, to be\r\nheated before they enter the pipes at all.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the total oil transported to-day by the American\r\npipe-line system exceeds half a million barrels daily. The lines\r\nthemselves--all laid, of course, below ground--are so unobtrusive and\r\ndo their work so quietly and unseen, that they attract no attention,\r\nand yet they are vastly important to not only the business of the\r\nStates, but to those myriads of consumers abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, impossible to over-estimate the importance of this\r\nup-to-date system of oil transportation in the United States as it\r\nexists to-day. To show the impossibility of conducting the present-day\r\nAmerican petroleum industry without the use of pipe-lines, let me give\r\na few facts. The large oil-tank cars, which are not unusual sights on\r\nour railways, hold, at the maximum, about 25 tons of oil. Excluding\r\nCalifornia altogether from these illustrations, the half-a-million\r\nbarrels of oil which are transported daily in the States by pipe-lines\r\nwould fill over 2,500 tank cars. Taking 25 cars to make up a freight\r\ntrain, it would require fully 100 trains daily to transport the oil\r\nthat now goes by pipe-line, and inasmuch as it is estimated that the\r\noil on the average is transported overland (or, rather, under-land)\r\n1,000 miles, it would require, approximately, 200,000 railroad tank\r\ncars to do the daily work in connection with the transport of oil in\r\nthe United States east of the Rocky Mountains, for the average movement\r\nof tank cars is 30 miles daily, and all empty cars must be returned.\r\nNo less than 8,000 railroad engines would be required to do this work,\r\nwhich, on the face of it, is a railway impossibility.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have devoted more space to the question of pipe-line\r\ntransport in the States than the confines of this little work warrants,\r\nbut the subject is one of great interest to all who would know the\r\nmagnitude of the organization which is comprised in the limits of the\r\npetroleum industry.\r\n\r\nThe United States, however, is but one of the large oil-producing\r\ncountries where the pipe-line system for the land transport of oil has\r\nbecome the backbone of transport. In Russia, for instance, the fields\r\nof production are situated hundreds of miles from the exporting ports,\r\nand, following upon the principles which obtain in the United States,\r\nthe pipe-line system had, perforce, to be adopted. In this respect,\r\nhowever, Russia has still a great deal to learn from our Western\r\nfriends, and the conservative policy which permeated the Russian Empire\r\nas a whole has precluded the making of much headway.\r\n\r\nThe Russian oil-fields--those of Baku and Grosny--are situated at great\r\ndistance from the coast, and the necessity of connecting both fields\r\nwith the export port of Batoum, on the Black Sea, has frequently been\r\nput forward as a project offering the one solution of the difficulties\r\nattending the retention of a large export oil trade. The Grosny\r\npipe-line is still a scheme for future solution, but that affecting\r\nBaku has been solved by the laying of a pipe-line from Baku to Batoum.\r\nThis line, which is approximately 650 miles long, runs direct between\r\nthe two oil centres and, assuming it operates 24 hours in the day, has\r\na capacity of transporting over 3,000 tons of oil daily. Inasmuch as\r\nthe Russian oil refineries are at Baku, the line is used solely for\r\nthe transportation of the refined products. The line itself is laid\r\nalongside the railway line of the Transcaucasian Railway, at a depth of\r\n4 feet, but many strange stories are related as to the tapping of it at\r\nvarious points, and a lucrative trade being done in the oil so caught.\r\n\r\nWhen normal conditions return to Russia and the petroleum industry\r\nrights itself, Russian petroleum products will again come on the\r\ninternational markets, and in this respect the Grozny oil will be able\r\nto secure an outlet via Novorossisk.\r\n\r\nRoumania can also boast of a main trunk pipe-line for refined products\r\nfrom the inland refineries direct to the port of Constantza. This\r\nimportant project, which has been carried out practically by the\r\nGovernment itself, was just about ready for service when the European\r\nWar broke out: it has, therefore, had little time in which to display\r\nits practical use to the petroleum industry at large. When one\r\nrecollects that Roumania’s future, so far as the petroleum industry\r\nis concerned, lies in the direction of the building up of its already\r\nestablished export trade in petroleum products, the necessity for\r\nsuch a trunk pipe-line to the seaboard has been obvious for many\r\nyears. Unlike the case of the United States, there are no interesting\r\nevents to recall which delayed the advent of this new form of land oil\r\ntransportation. There is only one oil pipe-line of any considerable\r\nlength in the United Kingdom and this runs across Scotland from Old\r\nKilpatrick (on the west) to Grangemouth (on the east coast), its\r\nterminal being in close proximity to the naval base at Rosyth. The\r\nline, which is 36 miles long, was laid to circumvent the activity of\r\nenemy submarines, but was only completed in November, 1918, after the\r\nconclusion of the European hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe one other important oil-pipe-line which calls for mention is that\r\nconnecting the oil-fields of Persia with the coast. In this scheme, the\r\nBritish Government is heavily interested, and, though there has been\r\nmuch criticism of its action, there is no doubt that, in due time, the\r\nPersian fields will play an important part in the supply of petroleum\r\nproducts to England, and, in that connection, the Persian pipe-line\r\nmust naturally prominently figure, since, without it, there would be\r\nnumerous difficulties to be contended with in getting the oil to the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe carrying of large quantities of petroleum products over the seas of\r\nthe world is a subject which has taxed the minds of experts quite as\r\nmuch as that of land transport. For many years it was the rule to ship\r\npetroleum products overseas in the ordinary barrels (approximately, 42\r\ngallons each) to the consuming countries. It was a costly business,\r\nfor, apart from the initial cost of the barrels themselves, they\r\ntook up a very considerable space on the vessels, which was not\r\nproportionate with the quantity of oils carried. Leakage also played\r\na very important rôle in this ocean transport, and, generally, the\r\nprinciple left much to be desired. The _Atlantic_ was doubtless the\r\nfirst vessel designed to carry petroleum in bulk from America, but\r\nrecords show that some years previously--in 1863--a Mr. Henry Duncan,\r\nof Kent, sent the first oil-carrying vessel to Europe. The vessel,\r\nhowever, never completed her voyage, for she was lost in the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence, just as she was starting on her trip across the Atlantic.\r\nThe _Charles_--quite a small vessel--also played a part in the early\r\ndays of bulk oil transport across the Atlantic, for this steamer was,\r\nI believe, the first to employ iron tanks for the bulk transport of\r\npetroleum. After these first few attempts to convey petroleum in\r\nbulk from continent to continent, tank vessels steadily wiped the\r\nbarrel-carrying boats off the seas. It was found that not only did oils\r\ncarried in bulk take up but one-half the space of those in barrels,\r\nbut the cost of the oak-staved barrels themselves (usually 5s. each)\r\nwas obviated. At first, sailing ships were adopted to meet the newer\r\nrequirements, but later, vessels propelled by steam were introduced.\r\n\r\nAt first the shipbuilders had nothing to guide them in the shape of\r\npractical experience of bulk oil carriers, but, from small things,\r\na great ocean trade in bulk petroleum products soon grew. It is\r\ninteresting to note the enterprise which English shipbuilders displayed\r\nin this new method of handling petroleum for ocean transport, for\r\nduring at least two decades the vast bulk of construction of oil\r\ncarriers took place in English shipbuilding yards. The opening of the\r\nFar Eastern fields of production led to the construction of a large\r\nnumber of oil tankers--each of increasing size--for Messrs. M. Samuel\r\nand Company, and these were named after various shells. The fleet of\r\n“Shell” tankers to-day ranks as one of the finest in the world, and\r\nforms the connecting link between the prolific oil-producing properties\r\nof the “Shell” Transport and Trading Company, Ltd., in the Far East,\r\nand the demand for petroleum products in this and other countries, the\r\nvessels themselves being owned by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company,\r\nLtd., one of the influential owning interests in the wide ramifications\r\nof the “Shell” Company.\r\n\r\nFor several years the oil tanker _Narragansett_, owned by the\r\nAnglo-American Oil Company, Ltd. (London), held claim to being the\r\nlargest bulk oil carrier in the world, for the good ship had a capacity\r\nof nearly 11,000 tons of products. The size of this vessel may be\r\njudged from the fact that she had a length between perpendiculars\r\nof over 510 feet, with a 63 feet beam, while her moulded depth was\r\n42 feet. This vessel, which marked a distinct step forward in oil\r\ntanker construction, belonged to Lloyd’s A1 three-deck class. The\r\nAnglo-American Oil Company has shown its belief in oil fuel for ocean\r\npower purposes by contracting for internal combustion-engined tankers,\r\nand the first of this class was launched in November, 1919.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE MAMMOTH TANKERS OF THE EAGLE OIL COMPANY’S\r\nFLEET]\r\n\r\nIt was left to the enterprise of the Eagle Oil Transport Company--that\r\nimportant concern associated with Lord Cowdray’s immense oil\r\norganization for handling Mexican petroleum products--to make what\r\nwill ever go down as the most bold policy of increasing the size of\r\noil tankers by 50 per cent. upon all predecessors. Some six years ago,\r\njust when the Mexican fields were commencing to pour forth their flood\r\nof oil for the world’s requirements, the Eagle Oil Transport Company\r\nincluded in its programme of activities the building of an immense\r\nfleet of oil tankers, and it was decided that a number of these should\r\neach have a capacity of 15,000 tons of petroleum products. There were\r\nmany who asserted that the limit to the size of oil tankers had been\r\nreached, but, undaunted, the Company went forth with their policy.\r\nIt was a bold stroke, yet a successful one, for not only have the\r\nvessels proved to be very practical, but they have taught a lesson in\r\neconomy of ocean transport which has been seriously taken to heart by\r\npractically all engaged in ocean oil transport.\r\n\r\nI had the honour of being one of the invited guests at the launch\r\nof the first of these gigantic oil carriers, and of subsequently\r\nexperiencing a trip in the mammoth floating “tank.” The vessel behaved\r\nadmirably at sea, and in a chat with the designer, I recollect asking\r\nif there were any reason to believe that the limit in size had been\r\nreached. The reply was pointed: “So long as we can have loading and\r\ndischarging berths large enough to enable such large vessels to be\r\nmanipulated, we can easily go beyond the present size.” Events have\r\nproved that the policy adopted by the Eagle Oil Transport Company was\r\njustifiable, for already a new oil tanker, the _San Florentino_, has\r\nbeen built, having a capacity of over 18,000 tons.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this interesting subject of ocean oil transportation,\r\nI should like to emphasize the distinct step forward which is marked\r\nby these latest oil tankers. To-day, we have entered the era when\r\noil fuel has passed its experimental stages and become one of the\r\ngreatest boons to those associated with the navigation of the seas.\r\nThe ease with which oil fuel is handled is remarkable, for vessels of\r\nthe largest size--that is, those using oil instead of coal for power\r\npurposes--could replenish their stores within a few hours at any oil\r\nport. In the transport of petroleum by the modern tankers, the taking\r\non board of a full cargo is accomplished in about a single day, thanks\r\nto the most improved means of pumping oil from the shore tanks through\r\nflexible pipes. The great oil tankers trading between this and other\r\ncountries and Mexico, load up off the Mexican coast by means of a\r\nsubmarine pipe-line, and, reckoning but fourteen return trips per\r\nannum, it will easily be apparent what immense stores of petroleum\r\ncan with ease be brought to the centres of consumption. Compare this\r\nwith the primitive methods of transport in barrels, and it will be\r\nreadily seen with what rapidity the hands of progress have moved during\r\ncomparatively recent years.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of oil tankers to-day, true to their calling,\r\nderive their power from oil, for they burn it under their furnaces,\r\nand, therefore, are not liable to those tedious delays so inseparable\r\nfrom the use of coal, and should severe storms beset their passage in\r\nMid-Atlantic, then a little oil pumped overboard will quell the most\r\nturbulent sea and permit a safe passage onward.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the motor-engined oil tanker will be the\r\norder of the future, for already vessels are being built which utilize\r\noil fuel internally--a much more economical process than burning it\r\nunder boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM AS FUEL\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has been written of late as to the use of petroleum as fuel\r\nfor the purposes of steam-raising, that the reader is bound to be more\r\nor less _au fait_ with the subject. It is, of course, one of vast\r\nimportance, and during the next decade is certain to receive far more\r\nconsideration than it has hitherto done, owing to the general desire\r\nthat our coal wealth shall be conserved as much as possible. Given the\r\none allowance that oil fuel can be procured at anything approaching a\r\nreasonable figure--and there is no reason why, in normal times, this\r\nreasonable price should not be prevalent all over the world--then\r\npetroleum offers many advantages over its older competitor, coal. The\r\nease with which large quantities can be handled, the simple method of\r\noperating anything which is fired by petroleum as fuel, and the fact\r\nthat its heat-giving units are far higher than those of coal, will ever\r\nbe the chief factors governing its popularity.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, fuel oil made its serious début, but at that time the\r\nsupply of the product was very uncertain, and, consequently, progress\r\nin passing from the old to the new form of power-raising was slow.\r\nTo-day, however, matters have materially changed. The crude oil output\r\nhas been immeasurably increased, and many fields whose production of\r\ncrude oil is essentially suited for fuel purposes have been opened up.\r\nIn this respect, the oil-fields of Mexico have no parallel, and it is\r\nrecorded that, once these fields are provided with adequate storage and\r\ntransport facilities, they can easily supply the whole of the fuel oil\r\nnecessary for the world, and at the same time have immense quantities\r\nto spare.\r\n\r\nBut, though the subject of petroleum as fuel has aroused much attention\r\nfor some years, there is still an erroneous idea prevailing as to what\r\nreally is fuel oil. A word or two on this question will, therefore, not\r\nbe without interest. Fuel oil is that portion of crude oil which is\r\nincapable of giving off by the process of ordinary distillation those\r\nlighter products of petroleum known as motor spirit, illuminating oils,\r\nor lubricants. It is, in a word, the residue of distillation which is\r\nunsuitable for refining purposes. It represents a black, tarry liquid,\r\nand is, of course, minus those fractions that go to produce the refined\r\nproducts. Many there are who refer to crude oil as fuel oil, but this\r\nis a misnomer, though crude oil, in many instances, is utilized for the\r\npurposes of fuel. In this chapter, however, when I speak of fuel oil,\r\nI am referring not to the crude oil as it comes from the ground (and\r\nwhich has a comparatively low flash) but to the article of commerce,\r\nthe residue of distillation, which is the real article--fuel oil.\r\n\r\nThe headway which fuel oil has made during the past few years has been\r\nremarkable, though it is safe to say that its general use is still in\r\nits infancy. In no matter what capacity it has been tried as a heating\r\nor steam-raising agent, it has proved itself capable of withstanding\r\nmost successfully the most stringent tests, and has convinced all who\r\nhave given the question serious consideration that it holds numerous\r\nadvantages over coal, yet has no drawbacks. Perhaps the most recent\r\nimpetus which has been given to the use of fuel oil is that following\r\nthe introduction of it, and now its general adoption, throughout the\r\nunits composing the British Navy. On land, however, it has for some\r\nyears achieved marked distinction. Especially is this the case in\r\nregard to its use on locomotives, the United States railways alone\r\nconsuming last year over 6,000,000 tons of fuel oil. In the realms\r\nof industry, fuel oil, too, is claiming the attention of those large\r\nindustrial establishments, and to-day is largely used for creating\r\nintense heats, such as are necessary in hardening, annealing, melting\r\nand smelting, rivet heating, glass-melting, etc.\r\n\r\nLet me first of all refer to the use of oil fuel for marine purposes.\r\nFifteen years ago, its use was very strongly advocated by Sir Marcus\r\nSamuel, Bart., for marine purposes, and he approached the British\r\nGovernment in an endeavour to get it taken up. Matters moved very\r\nslowly, but eventually oil fuel was adopted, and Admiral Sir William\r\nPakenham asserts that it was due to the unceasing efforts of Sir Marcus\r\nSamuel that the Admiralty vessels constructed during the war were\r\noil burners. The largest of this new class of vessels is the _Queen\r\nElizabeth_. Oil fuel is now largely used in place of coal on our great\r\nliners, vessels like the _Aquatania_ and _Olympic_ having gone over to\r\nits general use.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many reasons which have commended fuel oil to\r\nthe experts as a substitute for coal. In the first place, inasmuch\r\nas one ton of fuel oil is equal to more than one-and-a-half tons of\r\ncoal, the radius of action of units fitted for utilizing fuel oil is\r\nincreased over 50 per cent.--I speak from the point of view of bunker\r\nweight. Again, one ton of oil occupies considerably less space than\r\nan equivalent weight of coal, while this advantage can be materially\r\nincreased--as is now the usual practice--by carrying the fuel oil\r\nin double-bottom tanks. Then the bunkering question is one of vital\r\nmoment. Fuel oil can be taken on board under far cleaner conditions,\r\nand at a greatly accelerated rate, than would be possible with coal.\r\nThere is no arduous manual labour required. Once the hose connections\r\nhave been made, the fuel oil is pumped on board at the rate of hundreds\r\nof tons an hour, and a few hours suffice to re-fuel our largest\r\nbattleship. But it is when bunkering at sea is required that fuel oil\r\nfurther emphasizes its immense advantages. This question was some years\r\nago one of the problems of naval strategy: to-day it is regularly\r\ncarried out in the simplest possible fashion, hose connections to a\r\nstanding-by oil tanker being all that is required.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of fuel oil is that materially increased speed can\r\nrapidly be attained, for, with fuel oil fired furnaces, the ship’s\r\nboilers can be forced to nearly 50 per cent. above normal rating\r\nwithout that great strain on the personnel which would be essential\r\nin burning coal under forced draught. Then there is the great saving\r\nof labour effected when burning fuel oil, the stokehold staffs being\r\nreduced by quite 90 per cent. The fuel oil is automatically fed to the\r\nfurnaces and mechanically fired, the maximum heat of the oil burners\r\nbeing attained within a few minutes of starting. But the absence of\r\nsmoke when the battleship is proceeding at full speed is, perhaps, one\r\nof the most important advantages which the use of fuel oil gives to\r\nthe units of the fleets employing it. The emission of dense volumes of\r\nsmoke, which are ever present on a coal-fired vessel, is quite absent\r\nwhen fuel oil is used, and this advantage is twofold, for not only does\r\nit prevent the giving away of the location of the battleship, but it\r\nalso renders its own gun-fire more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe advantages attendant upon the use of fuel oil for naval vessels\r\nare, in the main, also strikingly apparent when oil is adopted for\r\nthe mercantile marine. It is many years ago since the oil tankers of\r\nthe “Shell” Transport and Trading Company, Ltd., commenced to do the\r\nvoyage regularly from the Far East to this country and back without\r\nan intermediate port of call. To-day, practically every oil tanker\r\nafloat burns fuel oil. But, of recent date, fuel oil has reached wider\r\napplication by reason of its being adopted on many cargo and passenger\r\nvessels, and, had the European War not considerably hampered ordinary\r\nshipbuilding construction, we should have seen ere this a number of\r\nthe largest vessels crossing the Atlantic exclusively running on oil.\r\nIn fact, arrangements have been made whereby many of our Transatlantic\r\nlines will operate exclusively on fuel oil, which will be taken on\r\nboard in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING OIL FUEL SUPPLIES ON BOARD]\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. J. J. Kermode, of Liverpool--the well-known fuel oil\r\nexpert--has taken the most prominent part in calling general attention\r\nto the immense superiority of fuel oil over coal, and it is due to\r\nthis gentleman’s untiring energies that not only does our Navy to-day\r\nuse fuel oil to such an extent, but that those responsible for ocean\r\npassenger transport have taken the matter up so seriously. There are\r\nthree general headings under which fuel oil use will affect transport\r\ncosts. They are as follow: (_a_) by increased passenger or cargo\r\ncapacity, (_b_) by increased speed, and (_c_) by a great reduction in\r\nrunning costs. As to the increased capacity, I have already shown that\r\nfuel oil can be stored in considerably less space than coal, and the\r\nsimplicity of both bunkering fuel oil, and using it on vessels, has\r\nalso been touched upon. With reference to the increased speed which\r\nvessels utilizing fuel oil can attain over those running on coal, I\r\nhave a concrete example in front of me. Two sister ships of the Eagle\r\nOil Transport Company--the _San Dunstano_ and the _San Eduardo_--each\r\nof 9,000 tons deadweight capacity, are fitted to burn coal and fuel\r\noil respectively. Upon a trip carried out under careful observation,\r\nthe weight of fuel consumed worked out as two to three in favour of\r\nfuel oil, while the indicated horse-power developed showed an 18 per\r\ncent. improvement in the case of the oil-fired vessel. But the striking\r\nfact of the comparison is that the _San Eduardo_ made the round voyage\r\nto Mexico--out and home--eight days quicker than the other, this\r\nadditional speed being solely due to the fact that with fuel oil it\r\nwas possible to maintain consistent speed throughout the voyage--an\r\nimpossible matter when coal is consumed. If space permitted, I could\r\nenumerate many cases where the results in favour of fuel oil are\r\neven more strikingly apparent, but I will content myself by briefly\r\nreferring to calculations made by Mr. Kermode, based upon voyages of\r\nour largest liners: they are sufficiently interesting and suggestive\r\nto record here. On an average, says Mr. Kermode, to maintain a speed\r\nof 25 knots, 5,500 tons of coal are consumed upon the voyage between\r\nLiverpool and New York by one of the mammoth liners; or 11,000 tons for\r\nthe round trip. Some 3,300 tons of fuel oil--which could be stored if\r\nnecessary (and as will frequently be done in the future) in the double\r\nbottom of the vessel--would, by automatic stoking, do even more work\r\nthan 5,500 tons of coal. Calculating the daily consumption of 600 tons\r\nof coal now used for 24 hours, this represents about 2,000 tons less\r\nfuel on a five days’ trip, land to land run, or 4,000 tons less, out\r\nand home. The utilizing of the vacant space thus saved for merchandise\r\nwould bring in a very handsome income. Of the 312 firemen and trimmers\r\nnow employed for a coal-fired liner, 285 might be dispensed with,\r\nand occupation found for them under healthier conditions ashore,\r\nsay in handling the additional cargo which would be carried. The\r\nsaved accommodation in this respect could be allotted to third-class\r\npassengers, of whom at least another 250 could be carried. Our mammoth\r\nliners are fitted with 192 furnaces in order to produce 68,000\r\nhorse-power (as was the case of the _Mauretania_ and the _Lusitania_),\r\nand, on the assumption that thirty-two fires are cleaned every watch,\r\n10,000 indicated horse-power is lost every four hours through burning\r\ndown and cleaning, a quite unnecessary operation with fuel oil. Figures\r\nsuch as these show the startling possibilities of fuel oil for marine\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL LIQUID FUEL BURNERS\r\n\r\nTHE KERMODE STEAM BURNER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KERMODE’S AIR JET BURNER\r\n\r\n    In the steam burner, the oil enters through B, the valve G\r\n    giving it a whirling motion.

This\r\nwas the first practical application of fuel oil for railway haulage.\r\nTo-day, nearly 50,000,000 barrels of fuel oil are consumed annually\r\nby the various railroads in the United States, and, according to\r\nthe official figures I have of the total mileage of fuel oil for\r\nthe past twelve months, the United States oil-burning locomotives\r\ndid journeys aggregating over 145,000,000 miles. Mr. Hall, of the\r\nAmerican International Railway Fuel Association, is responsible for the\r\nstatement that, owing to the fact that the steaming capacity of the\r\nengines is materially increased, a locomotive running on fuel oil can\r\nhaul a load of considerably greater tonnage and at a much increased\r\nspeed than would be possible with a coal-fired engine. Many Continental\r\nrailways use fuel oil rather than coal; the Roumanian and Austrian\r\nState Railways, the Western Railway of France, the Paris and Orleans\r\nRailway, being a few of the principal.\r\n\r\nSo far as England is concerned, the use of fuel oil has not made great\r\nheadway, for the reason that, while on the one hand, the majority of\r\nour great railway systems pass through the coal-producing fields, there\r\nhas, on the other hand, until recently been an absence of organization\r\nfor the supply of fuel oil. The Great Eastern Railway many years ago\r\nsuccessfully ran oil-fired locomotives.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that oil fuel will be increasingly used in the future for\r\nlocomotive purposes, and at the time of writing--December, 1919--the L.\r\nand N.W. Railway are carrying out experiments on express engines, with\r\na view to being able to some extent to discard coal.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial life of to-day there are a vast number of instances\r\nwhere fuel oil is rapidly displacing coal: the oil-fired furnace has\r\nbeen brought to a stage of perfection, and is being extensively\r\nand increasingly employed both in this country and abroad in regard\r\nto metallurgical and industrial processes. Without going into detail\r\nrespecting the numerous spheres in which the new fuel finds profitable\r\nemployment it is safe to say that these are being extended every year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL FUEL FOR MARINE PURPOSES\r\n\r\n    Arrangement of heaters, filters and pumps for burning oil\r\n    fuel for marine purposes. The installation is that of the\r\n    Wallsend-Howden pressure system.]\r\n\r\nA wealth of inventive effort has been bestowed in the perfection of the\r\nburners employed to consume fuel oil. Leaving aside for the moment the\r\nprinciples governing the use of oil in the internal combustion engines\r\nof the Diesel or semi-Diesel type, fuel oil used for the production\r\nof power is introduced into the furnace in the form of a spray, this\r\nbeing accomplished by atomizing the oil in its passage through a\r\nspecially designed burner. Of these burners, there are numerous makes\r\nupon the market, each of which possesses its own characteristics and\r\nadvantages. The one feature common to all fuel oil burners is the\r\narrangement for atomizing the oil fuel into a fine spray, so that\r\neach particle of fuel shall receive sufficient oxygen to ensure its\r\ncomplete combustion. Theoretically, it requires about 14 lb. of air to\r\neffect the combustion of 1 lb. of oil, and on the thorough combustion\r\nof the fuel oil depends the efficiency of the furnace. There are\r\nthree distinct methods by which the atomization is brought about, and\r\neach of these means possesses its advantages and limitations. By one\r\nmethod, the fuel oil is atomized by the use of steam; by the second\r\nmethod, compressed air is used; while a third system--that of applying\r\npressure to the oil supply itself--is sometimes adopted. Steam is the\r\nmethod usually employed for stationary boilers and locomotives, for it\r\nis the simplest to manipulate, and does not call for the employment\r\nof auxiliary apparatus in the shape of air compressors or oil pumps,\r\nbut most industrial oil furnaces work on compressed air, which gives\r\nexceptionally good results. There is no doubt that, with the use of\r\ncompressed air, say admitted at a pressure of 80 lb., a saving in\r\nfuel oil is shown over using steam at similar pressure, but the cost\r\nof the compressing plant, which must be taken into consideration, is\r\nsufficient to wipe out the greater part of this advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SCARAB” OIL BURNER]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the use of the fuel oil direct under pressure, this\r\nsystem generally involves the heating of the fuel oil, as well as\r\nits filtration, the fuel being supplied under pressure by means of\r\npumps. The system is extensively employed at the present time on\r\nmarine boilers operating with forced or induced draught, and, in this\r\nconnection, the Wallsend system stands pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nSince writing the first edition of this little volume considerable\r\nadvance has been made in connection with the use of oil fuel for\r\ngeneral power-raising purposes, and much of this expansion has been\r\nconsequent upon the introduction of a new burner--the “Scarab”--which\r\nis here illustrated. It is the invention of Lieut.-Col. Macdonald, and\r\nis the outcome of the war. When the Lieut.-Colonel was on service in\r\nMesopotamia, he recognized the possibilities of oil fuel, for while\r\nwood and coal were being transported from India at great cost, oil was\r\nrunning to waste on the neighbouring fields of the Anglo Persian Oil\r\nCompany. The Lieut.-Colonel therefore introduced a method of cooking\r\nby oil fuel, and immediately on his return to England he carried out\r\nexperiments which led to the introduction of the “Scarab” burner. It\r\nis a simple contrivance, and is practically fool-proof, since there\r\nare really no parts to get out of order. The oil fuel flows through a\r\ntube by gravity, while another tube carries air compressed to about\r\n10 lbs. pressure. The oil and air meet some inches distant from the\r\nmouth of the burner, and the combustion of the fuel, which is turned\r\ninto a finely atomised spray, is complete. Experiments have been made\r\nwith the burner for domestic purposes, and it has been adopted already\r\nin several London hotels for cooking purposes, though its general\r\napplication is practically unlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM AS A LIGHTING AND COOKING AGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom times immemorial, petroleum has been utilized as a lighting\r\nagent. Fifteen hundred years ago we have records of its use in the Far\r\nEastern countries, and in the seventh century one of the Emperors of\r\nJapan ordered that his temples should be illuminated by the sacred oil\r\nlight. And from that long distant date to the present times, petroleum\r\nhas played a not insignificant part in the provision of artificial\r\nlight throughout the world. For centuries, petroleum, as a means of\r\nartificial light, had the field to itself, and, though the Ancients\r\nconsumed large quantities for lighting purposes, the apparatus used for\r\nburning the oil were of a most primitive type, giving results which\r\nto-day would be considered far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last century, when the petroleum industry was\r\nmaking steady advance in several European countries, and a little\r\nlater, when the United States entered upon its era of oil progress,\r\nthere was marked development in the use of oil for lighting purposes.\r\nThe more modern oil lamp was introduced, and it is worthy of record\r\nthat in one year alone over fifty patents were taken out in the United\r\nStates for oil lamp improvements. The Germans, too, were not behind in\r\nthis respect; in fact, it is very largely due to the numerous German\r\nimprovements that the general governing principles of present-day oil\r\nlamps became so popular.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the ordinary oil lamp has often been, and still\r\nis, unjustifiably condemned for certain defects which are not inherent\r\nin it. It necessarily demands attention if it is to give a satisfactory\r\nlight, but, unfortunately, this attention is not adequately bestowed\r\nupon it, and complaints are the result. I have frequently argued that,\r\njust as it is possible with inattention to make the most improved\r\npattern of oil lamp operate unsatisfactorily, so is it possible, with\r\na little care and common sense, to get a really good and satisfactory\r\nlight from the cheapest oil lamp obtainable.\r\n\r\nIn days gone by, the quality of the oil was, in many cases,\r\nunsuitable for burning in the ordinary lamps; its lighting power\r\nwas very inferior, and it gave off a distinctly unpleasant smell.\r\nTo-day, however, the illuminating oil sold throughout the world is a\r\nfirst-class article, and its flash-point has been so raised that it\r\ncan be used freely without there being any suggestion of its lack of\r\nsafety. One still hears of the “dangerous” paraffin lamp, but, to all\r\nintents and purposes, whatever danger was attendant upon the use of oil\r\nlamps has long ago departed, though, of course, care must always be\r\nexercised, a remark which naturally applies to every illuminant. It is\r\nnot within my province to give a series of hints to the ordinary user\r\nof illuminating oil, but it is well to draw attention to a point which\r\nis frequently overlooked: that is, to see that lamps should be kept\r\nwell filled. It has been established that the light from an oil lamp is\r\ngreatly affected by the quantity of oil in the reservoir. An increase\r\nof 20 per cent. can be secured in the illuminating power of the lamp if\r\nonly the oil is kept to a good level in the container. This is due to\r\nthe assistance given to the capillary action of the wick by the higher\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThe advent of gas, and, at a later period, electric current, for\r\nilluminating purposes has, to an extent, restricted the use of oil as\r\nan illuminant, yet the reader will be surprised to learn that at least\r\n2,000,000 oil lamps are nightly lighted throughout Great Britain. The\r\ninhabitants of the majority of our villages have to fall back upon oil\r\nlamps after nightfall, and even in remote spots where enterprising gas\r\ncompanies have laid gas mains large numbers still keep faith with oil,\r\nno doubt by reason of its cheapness in normal times.\r\n\r\nThe greatest improvement made in regard to oil lighting has been in\r\nconnection with the introduction of the incandescent mantle. As a\r\nresult of this innovation, several elaborate designs of lamps have\r\nbeen placed on the market, and to-day oil is frequently used in large\r\nresidences in preference to the more modern illuminants. This is due,\r\nwithout doubt, to the fact that oil light is particularly soft, and,\r\nwhile giving a great illuminating power when consumed under the best\r\nconditions, lacks that dazzling brilliancy which causes injury to the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest methods of utilizing petroleum under an\r\nincandescent mantle was the Kitson system, according to which\r\nilluminating oil is compressed to about 50 lb. per square inch in a\r\nsuitable vessel, forced through a soft brass tube of very small bore\r\ninto a heating chamber, and, subsequently, through a needle orifice to\r\na Bunsen burner. The Kitson system, which has found many adherents in\r\nthe United Kingdom and abroad, is particularly adapted for lighthouse\r\nillumination, and in such cases where large units are essential. It is\r\ninteresting to record the fact that for some time one of London’s main\r\nWest-end thoroughfares was illuminated by incandescent oil lamps, and,\r\nthough they are now superseded, no tangible reason was given as to why\r\nthese highly economical means of illumination were ever removed.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids my referring to the various designs of oil lamps on the\r\nEnglish market to-day: they may be counted by their hundreds, while\r\nstill a larger number of those which have either been unsuccessful or\r\nhave found no sale may be found in the records of the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nDuring comparatively recent times, devices have been brought forward\r\nwhereby remarkably good results have been achieved by the use of\r\ngaseous vapour for portable lamps. In these cases, motor spirit is\r\nvapourized and used under an incandescent mantle. The best known\r\nof these lamps is the “Petrolite.” In this lamp, a porous stone is\r\nimpregnated with suitable hydrocarbons--motor spirit--and a current\r\nof air is introduced, the necessary draught being provided by the use\r\nof a fairly long chimney. The great advantage of the “Petrolite” lamp\r\nis that of its perfect safety, for if by any chance the lamp becomes\r\noverturned and the chimney displaced or broken, the draught ceases, and\r\nwith it, the generation of the inflammable vapour; the lamp, therefore,\r\nimmediately going out.\r\n\r\nBut while this method of utilizing motor spirit for illuminating\r\npurposes has been adopted to a very large extent by means of portable\r\nlamps, a greater field has been developed both in this and other\r\ncountries in connection with the domestic and industrial use of petrol\r\nair-gas for lighting purposes. These apparatus in the main possess\r\nbut slight differences. The essential principle of each is that motor\r\nspirit is carburetted and then, in the form of an oil gas, conducted\r\nthrough pipes in the same manner as coal gas is burned, to the rooms\r\nin which it is required. The carburetted air-gas is automatically\r\nproduced, and the small cost at which these automatic plants can be\r\nsupplied has rendered this system of lighting deservedly popular.\r\nIts great economy also is an important point, for 1 gallon of motor\r\nspirit will yield almost 30 cubic feet of vapour. This vapour, in\r\norder to form a lighting agent, is mixed to the extent of over 98 per\r\ncent. air and less than 2 per cent. petrol vapour, so that 1 gallon of\r\nmotor spirit will produce, approximately, 1,500 cubic feet of air-gas.\r\nThe plants, which are usually worked by a small hot-air engine (or,\r\nalternately, by the use of weights), supply only the demand created,\r\nand their control is automatic perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY’S OIL COOKER]\r\n\r\nTo-day, petroleum plays quite an important part in heating\r\narrangements, and several stoves are upon the market which burn the\r\nordinary illuminating oil. The prettily designed heating stoves of the\r\n“Perfection” or “Reform” make are largely in use, the efficacy and\r\neconomy of these being responsible for their popularity. Various makes\r\nof oil cookers are also in large demand. These range from the small\r\nvariety like the “Primus” stove, which burns illuminating oil under\r\npressure, to the oil cooking stoves of the Anglo-American Oil Company,\r\nLtd., which are quite competent to meet the requirements of practically\r\nany household. These latter stoves consume illuminating oil by means\r\nof the circular wick arrangement, and are in several sizes, one of the\r\nbest being that containing three lighters. Two of these are under the\r\noven, and one at the end can be used for boiling purposes. Speaking\r\nfrom several years’ experience of these stoves, I can say that they are\r\ntruly perfection. They are very economical, are easily cleaned, and\r\nwhen in full operation give off not the slightest odour. The oven is\r\nmore readily heated than with the coal gas apparatus, and the properly\r\ndiffused heat cooks all kinds of food most readily and perfectly. The\r\nillustration of the stove given on the preceding page will afford the\r\nreader a good idea of the apparatus, which deserves to be even more\r\npopular than it is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no other sphere of employment has petroleum made such rapid\r\nstrides during the past two or three decades as those recorded in\r\nconnection with its use in internal combustion engines, and one of the\r\nmost interesting features of modern mechanical engineering is their\r\ndevelopment. The advent and immediate popularity of this kind of engine\r\nhas been responsible for some of the most remarkable conquests of\r\nmankind over the forces of Nature, for it has brought into being the\r\nautomobile, the aeroplane, the dirigible airship, and a host of other\r\ninventions. It has also been responsible for quite a new departure in\r\nocean transport, for experiments have proved that the largest vessels\r\ncan be very economically operated by means of the internal combustion\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nIt might, by way of introduction, be well to explain for the benefit of\r\nthe uninitiated, the meaning of the term “Internal combustion engine.”\r\nAs most of my readers are well aware, the steam, or, rather, to be\r\nexact, the highly heated water vapour which drives the steam engine,\r\nis supplied from boilers which are heated by the burning of coal, oil\r\nfuel, or, sometimes, gas, and such engines might, therefore, be called\r\n“external combustion engines,” since the fuel is consumed in apparatus\r\nexternal to the engine proper. Such a term, however, is not in use\r\namongst engineers, and might raise a superior sort of smile if used\r\nin their presence. It will be readily seen from the foregoing that a\r\ngreat deal of weight and apparatus of some complication is required\r\nbefore the water vapour which drives the steam engine can even be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the internal combustion engine, the fuel (motor spirit\r\nor the heavier oils) is introduced directly into the engine and there\r\nvapourized and mixed with air so as to form an explosive mixture, so\r\nthat all boilers, with the necessarily complicated systems of piping,\r\netc., are done away with. It needs no imagination to understand the\r\nenormous saving of weight and space resulting from this elimination of\r\nthe boiler, and of the room which it would occupy.\r\n\r\nThe latter-day demands for the provision of lighter and yet lighter,\r\nas well as space-saving propelling machinery for submarines, airships,\r\naeroplanes, motor-cars, etc., especially during the war, have\r\nenormously stimulated the development of the engine which consumes its\r\nown fuel, and which is known as the internal combustion engine. A very\r\nwide field has thus been opened out for the exercise of the engineer’s\r\ningenuity, and he has availed himself to the full of the opportunities\r\nthus created, never failing to rise to the occasion when fresh demands\r\nhave been made upon him.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it is not at all surprising to find that\r\nnumerous firms have given considerable attention to the manufacture\r\nof the internal combustion class of engine, and many varieties,\r\nfor a multiplicity of purposes, are upon the market. The limits\r\nof space effectively prevent my detailing the list of even the\r\nlargest manufacturers; I will therefore content myself by referring\r\nto but one firm--Messrs. Vickers, Ltd.--who are now the largest\r\nmanufacturers in the Kingdom. This progressive firm has grappled with\r\nthe internal combustion engine problem from the earliest stages of the\r\npetrol engine to the latest forms of the heavy oil engine and its\r\nremarkable developments, and a large section of their establishment at\r\nBarrow-in-Furness is, and has long been, set aside exclusively for the\r\ndesign and manufacture of the heavy oil internal combustion engine. A\r\nvery large staff of expert engineers has been selected for the work,\r\nwhile experiments with a view to improvements being effected in details\r\nare continually being conducted in the establishment. The result is\r\nthat the development of this engine at the Barrow works has been\r\nattended with the highest success, a fact which is not widely known to\r\nthe general public.\r\n\r\nI take it as a great compliment that permission has been given me in\r\nthis book to refer somewhat in detail to the achievements of Messrs.\r\nVickers, Ltd., in this respect, for, hitherto, publicity in connection\r\nwith this section of the firm’s operations has been strictly withheld.\r\nOne of the latest and, it might well be said, the most important\r\ndevelopments in connection with Messrs. Vickers’ activities, is the\r\nVickers patent system of fuel injection, which enables an engine of the\r\nDiesel type (that is, using heavy oil) to be successfully run without\r\nthe use of an air compressor for injecting the fuel into the engine.\r\nBefore the introduction of this system, an air compressor, with its\r\nattendant complication and weight, had to be used for the introduction\r\nof the fuel into the engine. The elimination of this compressor has\r\nresulted in considerable economy in weight, space, and attendance,\r\nwhich, it will readily be seen, is a step in the right direction,\r\nwhilst the efficiency of the engine has also been improved. The\r\ndisadvantages attendant upon the use of the air compressor were early\r\ncomprehended by Messrs. Vickers, and they have spared no efforts (nor\r\nexpense) in developing the system which has led to its elimination.\r\n\r\nThe reader will require no knowledge of the subject to understand that\r\nthe question of fuel consumption is one of the highest importance\r\nin any engine system, and, in regard to this point, Messrs. Vickers\r\nhave made a special study, with the result that whilst the ordinary\r\nconsumption in a Diesel engine with air compressor is ·41 lb. brake\r\nhorse-power an hour (or 184 grammes _par force de cheval_), that firm\r\nhave been able to reach the low figure of ·376 lbs. B.H.P. an hour (or\r\n·170 grammes _par force de cheval_).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect, Messrs. Vickers, in bringing their engine\r\nto its present state of perfection, have, perforce, had a varied\r\nexperience with fuel oils--and a considerable one, too,--for they have\r\nexperimented with oils from all the well-known producing fields, and\r\nfind that, under their system, practically any fuel oil which can be\r\nmade to flow may be utilized in their engines--a fact which, in its\r\nimportance, speaks for itself. The physical properties of the oils used\r\nby them have, naturally, differed very considerably. For instance,\r\nspecific gravities have varied from ·810 to ·950 flash points from 100°\r\nFahr., to upwards of 250° Fahr., whilst the viscosities, which the lay\r\nmind might well be excused for thinking of as “degrees of stickiness,”\r\nhave varied from that of the ordinary kerosene (illuminating oil) to\r\nthe thick asphaltic fuel oil which comes from Mexico. Readers may judge\r\nfrom this of the painstaking and difficult experiments that have been\r\ncarried out in the Barrow works.\r\n\r\nThe advantages derivable from the use of the Vickers system could not,\r\nobviously, be withheld from general use, and the firm have upwards of\r\ntwenty licensees now manufacturing internal combustion engines under\r\ntheir designs. This fact, though not familiar to “the man in the\r\nstreet,” is known in the manufacturing world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 900 B.H.P. LOW DUTY VICKERS ENGINE FOR OIL TANK VESSELS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACK VIEW OF ENGINE]\r\n\r\nAlready a very large number of their engines have been constructed,\r\nthe approximate brake horse-power produced by same being upwards of\r\n337,600. These engines are of various sizes, ranging from 200 to 2,000\r\nhorse-power. The cylinders vary in diameter from 10 to 29 inches, and\r\nare arranged to work in groups to suit the power required, and may be\r\neither two-stroke or four-stroke cycle. The high temperatures set up in\r\nstarting the engine are sufficient to ignite the fuel, the introduction\r\nof which in a finely-divided condition has been the object of so many\r\nexperiments at Barrow; and so successful in this direction have Messrs.\r\nVickers been that they are now able to deal satisfactorily, by careful\r\nadjustments of the engine to suit the various fuels, with the most\r\ntroublesome oils.\r\n\r\nAs already referred to, the elimination of the air compressor\r\nconstitutes the chief improvement embodied in the Vickers type of\r\nengine, seeing that the greatest worry which the Diesel engineer has\r\nhad to encounter has been this very compressor. Needless to remark,\r\ntherefore, this feature alone strongly recommends the new system to the\r\nexperienced man. Further, the power required to drive the compressor\r\nabove-mentioned is considerable, so that economy is not one of the\r\nleast results due to its absence.\r\n\r\nThe principal advantages that can be claimed for the Vickers engine may\r\nbe summarized as under--\r\n\r\n    1. Safety in working. (Many accidents have been due to the use\r\n    of the air compressor.)\r\n\r\n    2. Weight is saved.\r\n\r\n    3. Space is saved.\r\n\r\n    4. Lower air compression in the cylinders for ignition, and\r\n    economy in air for starting the engine.\r\n\r\n    5. Reduction in first costs; and\r\n\r\n    6. Reduction in upkeep expenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 900 B.H.P. HIGH DUTY REVERSING ENGINE FOR LIGHT CRAFT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1,250 B.H.P. LOW DUTY VICKERS MARINE ENGINE FOR OIL TANK\r\nVESSEL]\r\n\r\nWith regard to (4), the low compression claimed is rather interesting,\r\nas Messrs. Vickers have successfully demonstrated that, although a high\r\ncompression temperature is necessary in the ordinary Diesel engine with\r\nthe usual air spraying compressor, a much lower degree suffices for\r\ntheir mechanical injection system, whilst there is a greater certainty\r\nof ignition of the fuel on its first introduction, even with the\r\nexistence of lower compression in the cylinder. The reason of this is\r\nthat the spraying air used in the ordinary Diesel is usually compressed\r\nto about 60 atmospheres (900 lb. per square inch). What happens when\r\nair spraying is practised is this. When the cold air carrying the very\r\nhigh pressure above mentioned enters the cylinder, it necessarily\r\nexpands, owing to the lower temperature already existent there, and\r\nsuch expansion chills the whole mixture, frequently preventing ignition\r\non the first introduction of the fuel.\r\n\r\nUnder the Vickers system of mechanical fuel injection, there is,\r\nof course, no introduction of very highly compressed air, and,\r\nconsequently, first ignition is rendered easier. From this, it will\r\nat once be seen that an oil possessing a high flash point can be more\r\neasily burned in the Vickers engine than in the ordinary Diesel, with\r\nthe necessary adjunct of an air compressor. Provision is also made\r\n(should the type of fuel used require it) for a higher temperature of\r\ncompression, and such oils are, therefore, much more easily dealt with\r\nthan in the ordinary Diesel engine.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have already said, it will be evident to the reader that it\r\nis only a question of time for air spraying, with its attendant use of\r\nthe compressor, to become a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism involved by the adoption of the new system of fuel\r\ninjection developed by Messrs. Vickers is exceptionally simple. It\r\nconsists of a small fuel pump, such as is ordinarily used for pumping\r\nfuel, a reservoir or accumulator of novel form to retain the charge,\r\nand a valve with a special nozzle to admit the fuel in the form of a\r\nfine spray into the cylinder. The accumulator, I may here mention,\r\nis merely a tube, flattened slightly on the sides, and of sufficient\r\nlength, when the oil is forced into it, to enable it to yield and store\r\nup a charge of fuel at the required high pressure, as explained in the\r\nnext paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of the system (and the secret of its great\r\nsuccess) is the very high pressure at which the oil is injected into\r\nthe cylinder. This pressure is kept up at about 4,000 lb. the square\r\ninch, so that the oil fuel, when it enters the cylinder and encounters\r\nthe hot compressed air therein, is in the form of a very finely\r\natomized mist, a conjunction of circumstances most favourable for\r\nignition. As in all great inventions, the simplicity of the arrangement\r\nis not the least of its merits.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat rough, yet brief, outline will suffice to explain the\r\nastonishing success of the Vickers heavy oil engine, but, if the whole\r\nhistory of these (and other) noteworthy experiments could be written,\r\na highly interesting story would be produced, showing indomitable\r\nperseverance in the face of discouragement, difficulty, and very heavy\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nI have avoided touching upon the ordinary kerosene engines, for I\r\nimagine they are too well known to need more than passing reference\r\nhere; nor have I gone into the details concerning the advent of the\r\nordinary Diesel engine, which was a German invention.\r\n\r\nI have preferred rather to deal with a British invention which is\r\nalready revolutionizing oil engine construction generally, and which,\r\nobviously, has limitless fields open to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be no chapter in this little treatise which will be more\r\ncarefully perused than the present one, for the subject is of direct\r\ninterest to every reader, whether actually associated with the search\r\nfor oil or not. To-day, as I have already mentioned in another chapter,\r\nthis country is dependent for practically the whole of its petroleum\r\nrequirements upon foreign oil-producing countries, and though ample\r\nevidence is forthcoming to suggest that there are possibilities of\r\nobtaining liquid oil in England--in fact, many years ago this was\r\nactually obtained in not inconsiderable quantities--it is very strange\r\nthat only recently have serious efforts been made in the direction of\r\nsystematic search for the valuable liquid.\r\n\r\nThat large quantities of petroleum can be produced in this country is\r\nagreed by all who have given the subject more than passing thought;\r\nthe question is, by what means shall this production be brought about.\r\nWhile it is problematical as to the amount of commercial success which\r\nwill attend the present search for liquid oil, though those who are\r\nmost competent to judge believe that large stores of liquid oil will\r\nbe found, it is already certain that there are vast possibilities in\r\nEngland for the production of petroleum from the treatment of the\r\nbituminous shales which freely abound in many parts.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the subject really divides itself\r\nunder two heads, and it is with the first of these--that of the\r\npossibilities of finding liquid oil reserves in commercial quantity in\r\nthis country--that I will now proceed to deal. For this purpose, it is\r\nbetter that we divide the country into three zones--western, middle,\r\nand eastern. The western zone will include the whole of England between\r\nthe third meridian of West Longitude and the Irish Sea, the Bristol\r\nChannel, and the North Atlantic. It will be bounded on the north by a\r\nline running near Whitehaven to the mouth of the River Tees, and having\r\nthe English Channel as its southern boundary. In this zone, the most\r\nnorthern occurrence of petroleum is found at Whitehaven, Cumberland,\r\nand the next is found on the Lancashire coast. Other indications are to\r\nbe found in Denbighshire and in the northern part of the South Wales\r\ncoalfield.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of petroleum in what may be described as the middle\r\nzone are far more important and numerous than those of the western\r\nzone. They are important in the physical conditions to which they\r\nare subordinate, and in their greater productiveness. They are more\r\nnumerous, and their geological position is more in direct relationship\r\nwith later dynamical alterations in the rock structures. In this\r\nzone occurs the most important occurrence which has so far been\r\nrecorded--I refer to that at Alfreton, in Derbyshire--for it was from\r\nthis natural flow of petroleum over 70 years ago that Dr. Young, the\r\nfounder of the Scottish shale oil industry, manufactured paraffin wax.\r\nNear Chesterfield is also unmistakable evidence of the presence of\r\nliquid oil at depth, for considerable quantities have flowed from the\r\nworkings at the Southgate Colliery. In this middle zone, too, are the\r\noccurrences of petroleum found near Wigan and West Leigh, while flows\r\nof oil are recorded from several spots round Barnsley and Ilkeston. The\r\npetroleum find at Kelham, near Newark, some few years ago, is important\r\nfor the reason that the drill in this case, at a depth of somewhere\r\nabout 2,400 feet, struck true petroliferous sands, underlain by dark,\r\nwaxy shales. The oil rock has been proved to consist of loose, coarsely\r\ngrained sand, having all the features of strata in which petroleum is\r\nordinarily met with. The great value of this boring is that it has\r\ndemonstrated the fact, so long doubted by many of the best geological\r\nauthorities in Great Britain, that all the geological conditions,\r\ndynamical as well as historical, are present in this locality for the\r\nformation and subsequent retention of liquid petroleum, and that,\r\nas Dr. William Forbes-Leslie puts it, despite all contention to the\r\ncontrary, a true oil-field exists in England.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, however, North Staffordshire alone, among all the\r\nplaces in England, has the distinction of so far having produced liquid\r\npetroleum in sufficient quantity for refining purposes. It was in 1874\r\nthat oil was discovered in a seam of coal in one of the pits of the\r\nMear Hay Collieries, Longton, and a contract was ultimately made with\r\na Mr. William Walker, Senr., of Hanley, who erected plant at Cobridge\r\nfor the purpose of refining the oil. I am indebted to Mr. Walker for\r\nthe following facts, though in a general way I have full corroboration\r\nfor them, for it was within a couple of miles from the collieries that\r\nI was born and spent my earlier days. The seam of coal wherein the oil\r\nwas discovered was one of the deeper seams, and by no means one of\r\nthe best in the district. At that time, the flow produced more than\r\n5 tons of crude oil per week, and inasmuch as England then was not\r\ninundated with American petroleums, great possibilities were seen in\r\nthe discovery. But almost before the refining of the crude had settled\r\ndown to be a commercial undertaking, the plans of operation were upset,\r\nfor a serious explosion occurred at the colliery, which rendered\r\nnecessary the closing of the pit. Twelve months later, however, they\r\nwere re-opened, and after the re-sinking had proceeded awhile, the oil\r\nwas found far up the shaft, and in due course the shaft was cleared and\r\nthe mines re-opened. Refining operations were resumed and continued for\r\na year or two, when the pits had to be closed on account of the shafts\r\nshrinking.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the course of a number of years, petroleum appeared in\r\nanother colliery less than a mile from the Mear Hay Colliery, and\r\nagain Mr. Walker secured the contract for the whole of the output. The\r\nquantity of crude oil found was several tons weekly, and a large stock\r\nhad accumulated when Mr. Walker’s attention was drawn to this new find.\r\nThis time, the supply continued for a longer period, and then again the\r\nseam of coal in which the deposit occurred had to be abandoned. Thus,\r\nwhile the resources of this part of the Charnian axis have not been\r\nproperly tested--for, in the opinion of the colliery owners, it is not\r\npossible profitably to work coal and oil at the same time--there is\r\nample evidence to suggest that, in the not distant future, there may be\r\nmost interesting oil developments in this part of North Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nThe eastern zone of the country doubtless furnishes the most\r\ninteresting petroleum occurrences in England. Here, the interest does\r\nnot so much depend upon the number of escapes, as upon the promising\r\ngeological conditions subserving the production and possible retention\r\nof petroleum. According to the investigations of Dr. W. Forbes-Leslie,\r\nF.R.G.S., whose valuable contribution on the subject of the occurrence\r\nof petroleum in England forms one of the most important papers ever\r\nread before the Institution of Petroleum Technologists, the northern\r\nline of oil occurrences runs from Filey, north-westerly, the principal\r\nfinds being located at Filey, Pickering, and Kirby Moorside. Oil, too,\r\nhas been found at Brigg, in Lincolnshire, at Market-Rasen, Haugmont,\r\nand Donnington-on-Bain. The line of oil occurrences starts at King’s\r\nLynn, on the Wash, and runs south-westwards as far as Cottenham,\r\nin Cambridgeshire, the principal occurrences being at King’s Lynn,\r\nDownham, Littleport, and Ely. The information obtained by the bore-hole\r\nat Kelham, to which I have already referred, is a factor of great\r\nvalue when taken into consideration and applied to an analytical\r\nreview of the petroleum seepages in England. It is a positive proof\r\nthat a true oil-bearing stratum underlies the surface rocks, at any\r\nrate, in one part of the British Isles, and, when it is considered in\r\nrelation with the surface position of the oil escapes on the eastern\r\nflank of the Pennine Chain, it suggests a possible connection between\r\nthose underground sources of oil and those surface escapes which are\r\nscattered, seemingly at such random, along the Pennines.\r\n\r\nThe attempts which were made but a few years ago to develop the\r\npossibilities of the Heathfield district of Sussex, with a view to\r\nobtaining commercial quantities of natural gas, were also prompted with\r\nthe idea of maybe striking deposits of liquid petroleum, though it is\r\ndoubtful, both from a geological point of view, and from the nature of\r\nthe natural gas which is there in abundance, whether liquid oil will\r\nbe met with in that part of the country. What has been established,\r\nhowever, is the fact that large quantities of natural gas are to be\r\nfound in this delightful part of rural Sussex, and it is a great pity\r\nthat the necessary enterprise has not been forthcoming to permit of\r\na really serious development. Some years ago, I motored an American\r\noil-man over the gas-fields of Heathfield, and he assured me that, if\r\nsuch evidences were found in the States, there would immediately be a\r\ngreat boom, and finance would freely flow in to stimulate development.\r\nBut not so with Heathfield, for the opinion is freely held that this\r\nfield is too near our midst for real speculative enterprise. Remove\r\nit to the wilds of Russia, and British finance would appreciate the\r\nimmense potentialities which to-day lie dormant. For those readers who\r\nare, perhaps, not conversant with the history of the Heathfield gas\r\ndevelopments it is well to record the fact that attention to these\r\ndeposits was drawn years ago, when a well was being drilled for water\r\non the property of the Brighton and South Coast Railway, near the\r\npresent station. Strong smells of gas prevented working for some time,\r\nand as these increased it was decided that the better course would be\r\nto suspend drilling operations. The tubes of the well were partially\r\ndrawn out, and the well sides caved in, yet the gas pressure increased.\r\nThe well was abandoned as a water well, but pipes were attached to the\r\ncap at the mouth, and a steady pressure of gas was emitted. It was\r\ndecided that, inasmuch as the gas burned with a pure flame, the station\r\nshould be lighted with it. That was over twenty years ago, and to-day\r\nthe well is still producing, and the station is still lighted with the\r\nnatural gas, which needs no refining. Not only so, but a well-appointed\r\nhotel close by utilizes the gas for lighting and cooking.\r\n\r\nA project was set on foot for sinking further wells and piping the\r\ngas to the southern coast resorts for general use, but lack of\r\ncapital prevented progress being made, and so, to-day, Heathfield,\r\nlike many other centres in the country, awaits the attention of the\r\ncarefully-directed drill to open up its underground wealth.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1917, the feeling in many parts of the country that the\r\nGovernment should take some action in order to develop these latent\r\nresources became so strong that a Bill was introduced into Parliament\r\nwith this object in view. No attempt was made to progress with it until\r\nthe following October, when a financial resolution was rejected by the\r\nHouse of Commons on the question of royalties. An amendment was adopted\r\nagainst the payment of royalties to the owners of surface lands who had\r\nmade no attempt to obtain liquid oil, and who, as a matter of fact, did\r\nnot know that it was there. Two months later the Petroleum (Production)\r\nBill was dropped.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1918, however, a most encouraging turn of events occurred,\r\nfor Lord Cowdray, head of the great firm of Messrs. S. Pearson & Son,\r\nand associated with those influential interests in oil represented by\r\nthe Mexican Eagle Oil Company, the Eagle Oil Transport Company, and the\r\nAnglo-Mexican Petroleum Company, made offers to the Government which\r\nwere couched in the following terms--\r\n\r\n(_a_) For the period of the war to place at the disposal of the\r\nGovernment, free of all cost, the services of his firm and geological\r\nstaff for the purpose of exploration and development.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If the Government did not wish to risk public money on what had\r\nto be deemed a speculative enterprise, Messrs. S. Pearson & Son were\r\nprepared to drill, at their own risk and expense as licensees, subject\r\nto certain areas being reserved to them. The offer committed the firm\r\nto an expenditure of, possibly, £500,000.\r\n\r\nThe public spirited offer of Lord Cowdray was most thankfully accepted\r\nby the Government and, with a minimum of delay, drilling sites were\r\nmarked out for the commencement of active operations.\r\n\r\nLord Cowdray’s geological staff particularly favoured the neighbourhood\r\nin Derbyshire, near to which Young made his first discoveries of\r\noil, and Chesterfield was selected as headquarters for the new oil\r\ndevelopments. The first oil well to be drilled in this country was\r\ncommenced in September, 1918, at Hardstoft, near Pilsley, on the\r\nGreat Central main line between Sheffield and Nottingham, and on\r\nTuesday, 18th October, the inauguration of England’s oil industry\r\ntook place there in the presence of many oil notabilities. American\r\ndrilling machinery of the percussion type was installed and, in view\r\nof the great depth to which it was expected the drill would have to\r\nproceed before encountering commercial quantities of oil, the well was\r\ncommenced with a diameter of 18 inches.\r\n\r\nA depth of just over 3,000 ft. had been reached at the commencement\r\nof June, 1919, at which depth oil production started. The well was\r\nput on the pump and began its steady yield of a good grade crude oil,\r\nthe production being about fifty barrels per week. Up to the time of\r\nwriting (December, 1919) the well is maintaining its yield.\r\n\r\nOther wells have been sunk in the Chesterfield area at Ironville,\r\nHeath, Renishaw, Brimington, Ridgeway and in North Staffordshire and\r\nScotland, but so far the success met with is not promising, though it\r\nis quite possible that commercial oil may be encountered.\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise has also commenced the sinking of a well at Kelham,\r\nNottinghamshire, near a site where, many years ago, small quantities of\r\noil were found in an experimental coal bore. Here, however, no definite\r\nresult has been attained. The Company--The Oilfields of England,\r\nLtd.--is operating under a drilling license from the Government under\r\nwhich the Government may take over the properties on a valuation should\r\ncommercial oil be found.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly turn to the other aspect of the question of the\r\nproduction of petroleum in England--that is, of producing oils from\r\nthe treatment of the bituminous shales. There are several sources from\r\nwhich petroleum can be obtained in this country by distillation, and\r\nthese are: (1) oil-shales, (2) coal, (3) cannel coals and torbanites,\r\n(4) blackband ironstones, (5) lignite, and (6) peat.\r\n\r\nThough in the past the oil shales of England have not been recognized\r\nas possessing great potential value, comparatively recent discoveries\r\nhave proved that at home we have enormous deposits of oil shales of\r\nremarkable richness. These are, so far as at present proved, situate\r\nin Norfolk and at short distance from King’s Lynn. Dr. Forbes Leslie,\r\nF.R.G.S., has for many years carried out a number of tests as to the\r\nquality and quantity of the shales in the Norfolk field, and as a\r\nresult of his work it has been proved that upwards of twenty miles\r\nsquare, there is an area in Norfolk underlaid with rich oil-shales.\r\nFrom a geological point of view the shales are remarkable, for they\r\nuniformly lie within 300 ft. of the surface, several of the seams being\r\nbut a few feet below ground. Their prolific nature may be judged from\r\nthe fact that in sinking test wells to depths of 300 ft. in various\r\nparts of the field, over 150 ft. of this oil shale has been drilled\r\nthrough, and it is thus established beyond all possible doubt that at\r\nhome we have all the materials at hand for a huge home production of\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the field has been secured by English Oilfields, Ltd.,\r\na company which, by reason of the influential interest behind it, is\r\nbound to be strikingly successful in its future developments in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe crude oil content of the shales is surprisingly great, for these\r\nshales yield approximately 60 gallons of oil per ton, or considerably\r\nmore than double as much as the Midlothian shales. Dr. Forbes Leslie\r\nasserts that there is already proved over 2,000,000,000 tons of shale\r\non the properties in Norfolk, and after having carefully inspected the\r\nwhole of the fields on many occasions, I think Dr. Leslie’s statement\r\nmay be taken as very conservative, for after all it is only a question\r\nof a simple sum of calculation which allows one to arrive at the\r\nfigures above quoted.\r\n\r\nCommercial developments have already been commenced on the Norfolk\r\nfields, and it is safe to assume that they will become of enormous\r\nNational importance, since the production of home oil supplies is\r\nto-day considered of vast National interest.\r\n\r\nThe other shales--such as the Kimmeridge shales of Dorset and\r\nSussex--are not being worked commercially in spite of strenuous\r\nefforts, and there remains much to be done before a steady supply\r\nof petroleum can be counted upon from these sources. Of the other\r\npossible sources of supply, coal yields too little, and at the same\r\ntime is considered too valuable to be utilized on a general scale;\r\nlignites are not yet opened for development on a sufficient scale;\r\nand peat has proved troublesome and expensive to treat owing to the\r\ndifficulty of eliminating the water. This, therefore, leaves cannel\r\ncoals, torbanites, and blackband ironstones, which are closely\r\nassociated and, in numerous cases, easily obtainable. Cannel coal, I\r\nshould explain, differs from the ordinarily known coal on account of\r\nits being less carbonized; it contains many fragments and particles of\r\nvegetable matter still showing their natural forms, though flattened by\r\npressure. The percentage of hydrogen to carbon is higher in a cannel\r\ncoal than in the bituminous coal, the percentage of inorganic matter is\r\nusually higher also, and the fracture and general appearance serve to\r\ndistinguish this variety of carbonaceous deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desire that the British Empire should be self-supporting in every\r\npossible way has been the predominating idea of our statesmen for\r\nmany years: it is to be regretted, however, that such little progress\r\nhas been recorded in the direction of the achievement of a practical\r\nresult. This remark applies to many commodities, yet to none more so\r\nthan to petroleum and its products. To-day, as much as at any preceding\r\ntime, the Empire is dependent upon foreign sources of supply for the\r\nvast bulk of its petroleum products. It is true that in the United\r\nKingdom there is a growing production of oil from the shale-fields\r\nof Scotland, but this total represents but a fraction of the large\r\nquantities of products which are annually required to meet the\r\never-increasing demands in commercial and domestic circles.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the European War, it was forcibly brought home to us\r\nas a nation that we were in a position regarding our petroleum supplies\r\nof absolute dependence upon other countries. The refined products\r\nwere an essential part of the war, for without them it would have\r\nbeen impossible to have continued for almost a single day, and yet,\r\npractically every gallon used had to be transported thousands of miles,\r\nand from a country which at that time was neutral. To make matters\r\neven worse, the Continental sources of supply from which we had been\r\npreviously drawing large quantities of petroleum were closed to export,\r\nfor, through the Dardanelles, the Roumanian and Russian export ports\r\nwere effectively shut off from the outside world.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Great Britain, the United States came forward with\r\nthe offer of all the petroleum products required for the successful\r\nprosecution of the war, and we owe to the United States alone all\r\nsuccess which has been the natural result of possessing ample\r\nrequirements of petroleum products both on sea and land.\r\n\r\nThe fact, nevertheless, stands out tragically prominent that we as a\r\nnation have not developed our own oil resources in a manner we ought to\r\nhave done, although everyone conversant with the oil business has been\r\nfor years advocating the giving of serious attention to this important\r\nsubject. To-day, speculative drilling for petroleum is proceeding in\r\nEngland, and it is to be hoped that some success will be ultimately\r\nrecorded, but, inasmuch as I dealt with the question of Petroleum in\r\nEngland in the previous chapter, I will at the moment pass over this\r\nvery interesting phase of the problem, and briefly look at the subject\r\nfrom an Empire point of view. Under the British Flag, we already\r\nhave, or control, some excellent oil-fields in Burmah, Persia, Egypt,\r\nTrinidad, and Assam, and each producing steadily increasing quantities\r\nof crude oil. The Burmah fields have achieved fame mainly owing to\r\nthe very large profits made by the chief operating company--the\r\nBurmah Oil Company, Ltd., whose head offices are at Glasgow. These\r\nhave of recent years been developed upon most up-to-date lines, and\r\nthe producing limits of the territory greatly extended, until now the\r\nannual crude oil production is upwards of 1,000,000 tons. The fields\r\nof Persia are very prolific, and their control to-day is in the hands\r\nof the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., an influential concern largely\r\ncontrolled by the British Government, by reason of the investment of\r\nlarge sums of public moneys a few years ago. The development of the\r\nPersian fields is more or less in its initial stages, and though huge\r\nquantities of oil have already been produced therefrom, the limits of\r\nthe presumably oil-bearing areas have by no means been defined. In\r\norder to facilitate the export of Persian oil, a pipe-line has been\r\nlaid from the fields to Abadan, on the Persian Gulf, and a programme\r\nhas already been laid down under which large quantities of Persian\r\npetroleum products will come upon the English markets.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian oil-fields have lately witnessed developments upon an\r\nimportant scale, thanks to the enterprise of the Anglo-Egyptian\r\nOil-fields, Ltd., a concern closely allied with the “Shell”\r\nCombination, and having as its Chairman, Sir Marcus Samuel, Bart.\r\nCommercial supplies of crude oil have been found at several points near\r\nthe coast of the Gulf of Suez, and a large refinery has been built for\r\nthe refining of the oil. Down to 1914, the only oil finds of importance\r\nhad been at Gemsah, where a number of oil gushers were struck, but\r\nthe field there proved to be one of most irregular formation, and\r\nnone of the wells gave anything like a permanent yield. Fortunately,\r\nin that year a field was discovered at Hurgada, the formation of\r\nwhich was found to be singularly regular, and the yield of which has\r\nsteadily increased until, at the time of writing, the production of\r\ncrude oil in it is over 15,000 tons per month. That additional wells\r\nhave not been sunk and the field further increased has been primarily\r\ndue to the difficulties of obtaining the necessary plant under war\r\nconditions. Some very large wells have already been brought in, but,\r\nso far, the petroleum industry in Egypt is quite in its infancy. It is\r\nquite obvious, however, that in the next few years the production of\r\npetroleum in Egypt will be increasingly large, and the developments\r\nare bound to have a significant bearing upon the oil situation\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks equally apply to the Trinidad fields, where the\r\nanticipations of those associated with the pioneer oil operations have\r\nbeen more than fulfilled. Some prolific fields have been opened up,\r\nand the production to-day is such that an export trade of considerable\r\nmagnitude can be maintained. Developments upon the Island were\r\nimpeded by the total absence of roads in the oil districts, and much\r\npioneer work had to be undertaken before it was possible to commence\r\nthe serious exploitation of the fields themselves. The crude oil of\r\nTrinidad is of both the light and the heavy grades, the former showing\r\nremarkable percentages of motor spirit, while the latter is used not\r\nonly as fuel oil but also for the treatment of roads so as to render\r\nthem dustless. It is in Trinidad that there is the famous pitch lake,\r\nfrom which for many years large quantities of asphalt have been removed\r\nand exported for a variety of purposes. Trinidad asphalt, in fact,\r\nis well known all over the world. The potentialities of the Island\r\nare rapidly being appreciated, for its geographical position is such\r\nthat would make it a practical base for the “oiling” of the great\r\nocean-going vessels which are rapidly passing over from coal to fuel\r\noil burning.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of oil-fields which are under the British Flag,\r\nmention must be made of Canada, whose oil industry has been developed\r\nfor many years. The principal producing fields are in Ontario, and the\r\ntown of Petrolia is the centre of the petroleum interests. But the\r\nwells are not of the prolific class, and almost without exception show\r\na very poor return for operating. Many of them are sunk only to the\r\nshallow strata, and their operation would certainly be profitless were\r\nnot a system employed by which quite a number of small producing wells\r\nare pumped by central power. From time to time, Canada has experienced\r\nvarious oil booms, one of the most recent being that which occurred\r\nin Calgary, in 1914. A well showed a small production of high-grade\r\noils, and immediately the country for miles round became the centre of\r\nan oil fever, which gradually died down when a number of unsuccessful\r\ndevelopments took place. To-day, the output of the Canadian fields\r\nis steadily declining, and all efforts to stimulate the production\r\nhave so far failed. Even a Government bounty of 1½ cents a gallon of\r\noil produced has failed to encourage an increase in output, and it\r\nis evident that, unless new fields are opened out, the future offers\r\nlittle hope.\r\n\r\nThe total production of petroleum to-day by the oil-fields developed\r\nin the British Empire represents but about 2 per cent. of the world’s\r\ntotal petroleum output: it is therefore clear that, if we intend\r\nto secure our oil supplies in the future from territory under the\r\nBritish Flag, large supplementary sources of supply must be found. It\r\nis doubtful whether any additional liquid oil regions will be found\r\nto produce oil in commercial quantity, for, though several attempts\r\nhave been made in various parts with this end in view, they have not\r\nachieved success, and numerous instances might be quoted where the\r\nemployment of British capital in an endeavour to bring about this much\r\ndesired result has met with failure.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises: Is it possible to augment considerably\r\nEmpire-produced oils from other means of development? In this\r\ndirection, the future is full of promise, for, though Nature has not\r\ngiven the Empire freely of liquid oil-producing fields, there are\r\nimmense areas of oil-bearing shales at home and in our Dominions\r\noverseas which can, without great difficulty, be turned into most\r\nuseful account. It is well known that great deposits of retortable\r\nmaterial exist within the Empire’s bounds, and many of these deposits\r\nare exceedingly rich. At the moment, however, scarcely any have been\r\nexploited, and none adequately developed. From time to time, many\r\nsamples of oil-bearing shales from various parts of the Empire have\r\nbeen sent to this country for analysis, and these have usually been put\r\nthrough Scottish retorts with varying results.\r\n\r\nBut the unsatisfactory analyses have not been due to the qualities\r\nof the shale or torbanite examined, but to the methods by which\r\nthe distillations were carried out. The well-known consulting oil\r\nengineer--Mr. E. H. Cunningham-Craig--made a special point of this in a\r\nmost interesting article which recently appeared in one of the Empire\r\nmagazines, and he pointed out that the reasons for the unsatisfactory\r\nconclusions arrived at were very simple and obvious. The Scottish\r\nretorts are designed to deal effectually with highly inspissated and,\r\nas a rule, not very rich, oil-shales. The recovery of the maximum\r\namount of sulphate of ammonia is a desideratum; a sufficient supply\r\nof incondensable gases to fire the retort must be produced; while\r\nthe recovery of the lighter fractions (motor spirit) of the material\r\ntreated was not an object of the first consideration. For these\r\npurposes, says Mr. Cunningham-Craig, large and high vertical retorts\r\nare used, the temperature of distillation is comparatively high,\r\nsuperheated steam is blown into the retorts, and a fairly complete\r\nextraction of volatile matter is achieved. But to apply such methods to\r\na very rich and fresh torbanite--such as the richer shales of New South\r\nWales--is absurd, involving many practical difficulties and not giving\r\nthe most remunerative results.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the rich oil-shales of New Brunswick (Canada), though more\r\nnearly allied to the Scottish shales, differ from them both chemically\r\nand physically to such an extent as to require different treatment. Let\r\nme now briefly refer to the deposits which are known in the Dominions\r\nand Colonies that give promise of yielding oil in commercial quantities\r\nby destructive distillation. I will first take the shales of Canada,\r\nfor though, as I have pointed out, the Dominion’s production of liquid\r\noil is steadily decreasing, there are numerous deposits of shales which\r\nonly await careful exploitation and development in order to render\r\nCanada a petroleum-producing country of considerable magnitude. The\r\noil-shales of New Brunswick have been known for many years, yet only\r\na fraction of the area has been yet prospected. Experiments with the\r\nshales have shown that they are capable of producing nearly 50 gallons\r\nof crude oil the ton of shale treated, while ammonium sulphate has been\r\nproduced at the remarkable proportion of 77 lb. a ton. Albert County is\r\none of the best shale-fields, and it is here that a Government scheme\r\nhas now been promulgated. The shales of Nova Scotia are likewise to be\r\ncommercially developed, but so far no serious attempt has been proposed\r\nto deal with the enormous areas in Newfoundland, the Province of\r\nQuebec, and other already known regions of Canadian oil-shales.\r\n\r\nAustralia can boast of very large areas of shales: some deposits\r\nhave been operated for several years, but others are still awaiting\r\ndevelopment. From a variety of causes, however, the shale-oil industry\r\nof Australia has never been set upon a profitable footing. The\r\nCommonwealth Oil Corporation some years ago set out to accomplish\r\nmuch, but the only thing which it seemed to do with energy was to\r\nsail to destruction. Its failure cannot be said to have been due to\r\nany absence of the material it set out to treat for petroleum, for at\r\nevery turn enormous quantities were opened up. It would appear that the\r\nimmensity of the possibilities which awaited its operations was one\r\nof the prime reasons for its premature decay, while there is no doubt\r\nthat the system it employed was by no means the best for treating the\r\nshales. A more simple and less expensive method of retorting the shales\r\nwould doubtless ensure successful working. In Queensland, Tasmania, and\r\nNew Zealand the presence of these shales has been proved over extensive\r\nareas, and though for the most part they have so far been neglected,\r\nthere is reason to hope that, in the not distant future, the advantage\r\nto be derived from their commercial exploitation will be the more\r\nwidely appreciated. A most lucrative industry could be built up by the\r\nCommonwealth of Australia by the distillation of the torbanites there,\r\nand though, perhaps, it is too much to expect that an export trade in\r\npetroleum products could be built up, there is no doubt whatever that\r\nthe large requirements for petroleum products in the Dominion could\r\neasily be met by the production from home sources.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of developing a shale industry in Africa are not\r\nparticularly promising, though they are by no means out of the range\r\nof probability. In the coal series in the Transvaal, beds of what are\r\nknown as “oil-shales” are encountered in several localities The seams\r\ngenerally are thin, and in some cases unworkable, but the material is\r\nvery rich, and has proved capable of yielding high percentages of crude\r\noil.\r\n\r\nIn Sarawak (British North Borneo) the “Shell” Company is carrying out\r\nmost important and highly successful developments, which are bound to\r\nhave far-reaching and gratifying results in regard to developments\r\nunder the British Flag.\r\n\r\nAs I have shown, the problem of Imperial oil supply would be far on\r\nits way to solution by the development of the various shales in the\r\nBritish Empire, and the pity is that a more progressive policy has not\r\nbeen adopted in regard thereto long before the subject became of such\r\npressing importance. Each of our Colonies--like the Mother Country--is\r\na large consumer of petroleum products, and each is also totally\r\ndependent upon imported supplies, yet within the borders of each are to\r\nbe found large deposits of the necessary crude material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM’S PART IN THE GREAT WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nA perusal of the preceding chapters of this little work will have made\r\nit clear to the reader that petroleum and its products play a most\r\nimportant part to-day in the life of nations: if, however, one would be\r\nimpressed with the immensely significant rôle which petroleum products\r\nhave played in the conduct of the great European War, a brief reference\r\nto the subject will amply suffice. From the commencement of the Titanic\r\nstruggle in 1914, it became obvious to those who were most competent\r\nto judge that, if victory was to be on the side of the Allies, it was\r\nimperative that they should possess sufficient reserves of petroleum\r\nproducts for all purposes, for it was evident then that activity would\r\nnot be limited to armies on the land, but that the air and the sea\r\nwould also become battle-grounds whereon the destinies of nations would\r\nin part be decided.\r\n\r\nGermany, too, saw this; before the war it had been practically\r\ndependent upon regular supplies from the United States as well as\r\nfrom Roumania, but the bulk of its requirements came from the former\r\nmentioned country. With its States’ oil shipments cut off, it turned\r\nits attention to securing at least part of its stocks from the neutral\r\nNorth-Western European countries, which, in their turn, were likewise\r\ndependent upon America. The ruse worked for some time, and the\r\nunsuspecting American exporters shipped cargoes to Denmark, Norway, and\r\nSweden with little idea that the bulk of these were ultimately to find\r\ntheir way into Germany. It was only when the figures were published in\r\nthe States as to the abnormally large quantities of petroleum products\r\nthat had been sent to the European neutral countries that, to the\r\nthinking mind, it became obvious something was wrong.\r\n\r\nI can modestly claim to have called the attention of the British\r\nGovernment to this underhand proceeding early in 1915, when I not\r\nonly gave them details of cargoes which had been delivered to various\r\nNorth-Western European ports _en route_ to Germany, but also managed\r\nto secure the names of vessels all laden with such supplies, which at\r\nthat time were crossing the Atlantic. Mr. Winston Churchill, to his\r\ncredit be it said, acted without delay, and within a few days, as the\r\nvessels passed the North of Scotland, they were stopped, and--well, to\r\ncut a long story short, this country got the petroleum products which,\r\nin accordance with the original plan, would have gone to Germany.\r\nSome time afterwards there came a voice of protest from one or two\r\ninterested persons in those neutral countries, for they declared that\r\nnot a single barrel of petroleum had gone over to Germany, but evidence\r\nwas soon forthcoming to show how well Germany’s ruse had worked for\r\nsome months, and a prosecution in one of those countries made against\r\nan importing firm, for actually sending petroleum supplies into\r\nGermany, effectively closed the protest from those who would have liked\r\nthe enemy’s desires to have been undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that Germany at that time was in dire\r\nstraits for sufficient petroleum products for its military purposes:\r\nhad the war been somewhat delayed in its commencement, she would have\r\nbeen far better prepared, for, under the auspices of the Government,\r\nthere had been laid down an elaborate programme for the importation\r\nand distribution of Roumanian petroleum products throughout Germany.\r\nAs it was, the country was unprepared, and, though in other directions\r\nevery possible precaution had been taken to carry through an elaborate\r\nmilitary programme of offence, the prospective dearth of sufficient\r\nsupplies of petroleum products necessitated the enforcing of the\r\nmost stringent regulations with regard to the uses of all petroleum\r\nproducts, excepting for military purposes.\r\n\r\nThe taking of the Galician fields from the Central Armies by Russia\r\ngave a serious set-back to Germany’s military plans, and it was only\r\nwhen the Russians had to withdraw from Lemberg that the enemy was able\r\nto count upon sufficient supplies to meet his military requirements.\r\nTo an extent, he was even then doomed to disappointment, for, when his\r\narmies arrived on the Galician fields, they found that practically the\r\nwhole of the petroleum reserves had been destroyed, and a large number\r\nof the prolific producing wells more or less permanently damaged.\r\nNor, to my mind, was the advance into Roumania prompted by the idea\r\nof territorial gains so much as to secure control of the country’s\r\noil-fields. Here, again, Germany’s desires were in part thwarted,\r\nfor the efforts of the British Military Mission, to which I refer\r\nelsewhere, had been eminently successful.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward, however, Germany’s supplies of petroleum\r\nproducts were secured, and that she turned them to account was a matter\r\nof common knowledge. Germany, naturally, greatly valued the acquisition\r\nof the Roumanian oil-fields, and it must be to its people a great\r\ndisappointment that the whole of these immensely prolific regions for\r\noil production are now permanently removed from the nation’s grasp.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the British Government did not seriously appreciate the\r\nimportance of petroleum products in war as well as peace until the\r\nwar cloud of 1914 was about to burst. It had taken no notice of the\r\nsuggestions made from time to time that in our own country there might\r\nbe vast petroleum reserves awaiting development, and it had not even\r\nshown any encouragement to the Scottish shale-oil industry. All that\r\nit had done, and even this was on the eve of war, was to invest over\r\n£2,000,000 in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., for the development\r\nof the Persian oil-fields, so that the Navy could secure ample supplies\r\nof fuel oil. But here, however, there were difficulties ahead, for the\r\nPersian fields are in the interior of the country and have to rely upon\r\npipe-lines to bring the supplies to the coast.\r\n\r\nEverything, therefore, depended upon the security of the pipe-line,\r\nand the idea which was in the minds of many who opposed the scheme as\r\nto the possibility of supplies being cut off by the activities of the\r\ninsurgents, was by no means a mistaken one; the pipe-line was, in fact,\r\npartially destroyed, and the transport of fuel oil held up for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs a nation, we have all along had to depend upon imported petroleum\r\nproducts, and, inasmuch as our supplies could be drawn at will from\r\na variety of producing countries, the idea that we might at one time\r\nfind ourselves cut off from supply does not appear to have occurred to\r\nmany. No sooner had the war started, however, than we found, owing to\r\nthe closing of the Dardanelles, that both Russia and Roumania could no\r\nlonger attend to our requirements, while the Far East, owing to the\r\ngreat ocean journey necessitated to this country (and the quickest way\r\nlay through the Mediterranean) could not maintain regular shipments\r\nwith us. It is fortunate that we found the United States willing, and\r\nfrom the start very desirous, to do all that was possible to help us\r\nout of a difficulty; while Mexico, with its wealth of British oil\r\ninterests, catered in every way for the meeting of the enormous demands\r\nwe made upon its resources.\r\n\r\nTo say that petroleum products have played a highly-important part in\r\nthe conduct of the war is but to under-estimate facts. The importance\r\nof their part has been equal to that of the supply of guns and shells,\r\nand, when the statement was made in the House of Commons in 1917 that\r\nadequate supplies of petroleum were quite as essential as men and\r\nmunitions, petroleum’s part was then not over-stated. Rather would I\r\nsay it was on the contrary, for, had there been at any time a dearth\r\nof any classification of petroleum products, then the vast naval and\r\narmy organization, both on and across the water, would immediately have\r\nlost its balance, and our great fighting units would automatically have\r\nbecome useless. Just think of it for a moment.\r\n\r\nTo-day, our great naval fighters--take the _Queen Elizabeth_, for\r\ninstance--rely upon fuel oil for purposes of power, while our second\r\nand third line units must also have it, for, whether it be fuel oil or\r\nthe lighter products of the oil refinery--I refer to motor spirit--it\r\nmatters not, so far as supply is concerned. The whole of our winged\r\nfleets in the air must, of necessity, be useless unless they can\r\nregularly draw large quantities of motor spirit, and the volume they\r\nconsume, even on a single trip, would surprise many, though it is not\r\npossible here to enter into figures.\r\n\r\nAt first sight one might be inclined to think that, apart from\r\npetroleum products being a very useful adjunct to the organization of\r\nbattles on land, their use is not of a very real nature, but, if we\r\npause for one moment, our first impressions are disillusioned.\r\n\r\nIt was my privilege at the end of 1917, thanks to the kindness of\r\nthe British Foreign Office, to pay a visit to the fronts of France\r\nand Flanders, and there to have an opportunity of seeing the part\r\nwhich petroleum products did actually play. The immensity of this\r\nimportance cannot be easily grasped, nor easily described. We all\r\nknow the remarkable progress which had been made in regard to the\r\nextension of the railway systems throughout the zones of battle, but\r\nit will surprise many to learn that it was when the rail-heads had\r\nbeen reached, and between there and the real battle front, that motor\r\nspirit had the realm of transport to itself. Tens of thousands of heavy\r\nmotor vehicles took up the work of transport when it left the railway,\r\nand it was this service that was required to see not only that our\r\nmillions of men daily received their food, but each and every sort of\r\nammunition also. But it was not even when the front line of battle was\r\nreached that motor spirit had finished its work. Those great machines\r\nof war--the tanks--had to remain stationary if they were not fed by\r\nlarge supplies of spirit, while petroleum, too, took a primary position\r\nin the making of the liquid fire which now and again we heard of as\r\ncausing such havoc to Fritz. But, at its best, the railway was somewhat\r\nslow at the Front, no doubt owing to the enormous congestion which\r\nwas inseparable from the reign of a state of war. Consequently, whole\r\nfleets of motor vehicles were employed day and night in a ceaseless\r\nstream of traffic, from the coastal ports right up to the zone of\r\nbattle. Without divulging secrets, it is safe to say that that branch\r\nof the service alone demanded millions of gallons of motor spirit\r\nweekly.\r\n\r\nBoth after as well as before battle, the products of petroleum were\r\nessential, for, when the Red Cross vehicles took up their humane work\r\nof transporting the wounded heroes of the fight, those, too, called for\r\ninnumerable quantities of motor spirit. And when darkness had fallen\r\nthe oil lamp came into general use. It was to be found wherever there\r\nwas a vestige of life in those zones of battle: the soldiers in their,\r\nat times, lonely dug-outs, used oil for cooking as well as for light,\r\nand all vehicular traffic was guided from disaster along the roads by\r\nthe use of oil, which also offered the only source of artificial light\r\nin the Red Cross vehicles. What an immense organization it was which\r\ndepended for its ceaseless activities upon the products of petroleum!\r\n\r\nOne day, while at General Headquarters, I expressed a desire to see\r\nthe methods by which all that world of activity secured its necessary\r\nsupplies of petroleum products regularly, when once they had arrived\r\nin France in bulk. A few days later, I was, accordingly, allowed to\r\nvisit the immense central depot at Calais, at which all the petroleum\r\nproducts required for use in the organization of transport were dealt\r\nwith. It is safe to say that at no centre in the world did there\r\nexist such an extensive petroleum depot, nor anywhere else was there\r\nan organization upon whose perfect working so much depended. Though\r\nmotor spirit necessarily occupied the first position of importance,\r\npractically the whole range of products was dealt with. The motor\r\nspirit was received in bulk, but at the depot had to be measured into\r\nthe familiar 2-gallon can (which was made on the spot) and sent up\r\ncountry in special trains each day. Specially coloured tins denoted\r\nthe best quality of the spirit, and it was that which was reserved for\r\nthe numerous aerodromes in France and Flanders. The magnitude of that\r\nbranch of the depot might be guessed when I state that at the time of\r\nmy visit considerably over 2,000,000 2-gallon petrol tins were being\r\neither stored or filled for up country dispatch.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of lubricants were also essential for the purposes of war,\r\nfor even motor spirit itself would be of little use for the internal\r\ncombustion engines, if the engines could not secure their regular\r\nsupplies of lubricating oils. These, too, had to be dispatched with\r\nremarkable regularity to every section of the battle zones, whilst, as\r\nI have suggested earlier, the daily requirements of war necessitated\r\nthe distribution of illuminating oil in large quantities.\r\n\r\nBut no reference to petroleum’s part in the great European war would be\r\ncomplete were it not to include mention of the way in which supplies\r\nof toluol assisted in securing victory to the Allies. Toluol, as is\r\nknown, is necessary for the production of high explosives, and in the\r\nearly stages of the great conflict, the output of high explosives was\r\nconsiderably restricted by the absence of sufficient quantities of this\r\nnecessary explosive primary.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time that a discovery of the utmost importance was made,\r\nfor, as the result of investigations carried out at the Cambridge\r\nUniversity, it was found that the heavy petroleums of Borneo contained\r\nlarge percentages of toluol.\r\n\r\nSir Marcus Samuel, Bart., the Chairman (and the founder) of the Shell\r\nTransport and Trading Company, Ltd., lost no time in apprising the\r\nBritish Government of the discovery, for it is in the Borneo oils that\r\nthe Shell Company and its allied concerns are chiefly interested.\r\n\r\nThe offer for the delivery of these immense quantities of toluol was\r\neagerly accepted by the British and Allied Governments, and from that\r\ntime onward, the supply of high explosives was practically unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe French and Italian Governments have asserted that, but for this\r\nspecific offer of toluol, the manufacture of high explosives would have\r\nhad to remain so limited, that it would have been impossible to bring\r\nabout an Allied Victory in 1918. Their thanks were publicly extended\r\nto the Shell Company at the conclusion of hostilities, and Mr. H. W.\r\nDeterding and the Asiatic Petroleum Company were specially thanked,\r\nwhile as far back as 1915, Sir Marcus Samuel, Bart., received the\r\nthanks of the British Government for his invaluable war services. It\r\nwas only after the firing of the guns had ceased on all Fronts, that it\r\nwas permissible to record in what a remarkable manner these services\r\nwere rendered.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of space have prevented my dealing, excepting in the\r\nmost brief manner, with this interesting subject: I only hope I have\r\nsucceeded in showing that, in times of war, as well as in those of\r\npeace, petroleum products occupy the position of first importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH SHALE-OIL INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the great interest which is now being centred in the\r\nproduction of petroleum in the British Isles--thus making this country\r\nto a large extent less dependent upon foreign sources of supply--the\r\nShale-oil Industry of Scotland is assuming a new importance, for the\r\nreason that it is in the direction of the development of new oil-shale\r\nareas in several parts of the country that experts look with a great\r\namount of confidence.\r\n\r\nIt is specially interesting, therefore, to deal at some length with\r\nthe growth of the industry, the methods by which the oil shales are\r\noperated, and the prospects for its extension.\r\n\r\nThe name of Dr. James Young, of Renfrewshire, will ever be associated\r\nwith the commercial exploitation of the oil-bearing shales in the\r\nMidlothians, for it was due to his enterprise that the Scottish\r\nshale-oil industry really owed its birth and much of its later\r\ndevelopment. It was while Young was managing a chemical works at\r\nLiverpool that his attention was drawn to small flows of oil which\r\ncame from a coal seam at Alfreton, in Derbyshire. This was in 1847,\r\nand after experimenting with the liquid, Young succeeded in extracting\r\ntherefrom on a commercial scale both a light burning oil and a\r\nlubricant, as well as wax. When the supply became exhausted, Dr. Young\r\nhad an idea to imitate the natural processes by which he believed the\r\noil had been formed. The outcome of this was the well-known Young\r\npatent for obtaining paraffin oil and other products from bituminous\r\ncoals at slow distillation.\r\n\r\nThe Young process was utilized with much success in the United States\r\nuntil such time as it became unprofitable owing to the largely\r\nincreasing production in America of liquid oils obtained direct from\r\nthe earth. It was about this time that a bituminous mineral known as\r\nBoghead coal, and existing in the Midlothians, was discovered, and\r\nfrom this Young secured upwards of 100 gallons of oil from each ton\r\ntreated, but soon this mineral was, in a practical sense, exhausted,\r\nand so the bituminous shales, now known as oil-shales, came in for\r\nattention. Before passing away from Dr. Young’s services in connection\r\nwith the establishment of the Scottish shale-oil industry, it should be\r\nmentioned that he figures very largely in more than one of the earlier\r\nScottish shale concerns. He founded the Bathgate Oil Company, which, in\r\nthe zenith of its operations, treated 1,000 tons of shale daily, this\r\nCompany being later merged into the Young’s Paraffin Light and Mineral\r\nOil Company, Ltd., one of the large Scottish shale-oil undertakings and\r\nwell known throughout the world to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish shale-oil fields, as exploited to-day, cover a belt of\r\nterritory which is about 6 miles broad and stretches from Dalmeny\r\nand Abercorn, on the Firth of Forth, southwards across the fertile\r\ntract between the River Almond and the Bathgate Hills to the moorland\r\ndistrict of Cobbinshaw and Tarbrax. Throughout this region there are\r\nvarious important mining centres, such as Broxburn, Uphall, East\r\nCalder, Mid-Calder, West Calder, and Addiwell; and in connection with\r\nthe shale-oil industry, upwards of 25,000 persons now find regular\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe shale measures on which the shale-oil industry depends, form part\r\nof the calciferous sandstone series of Mid and West Lothian and the\r\nsouthern coast of Fife. The carboniferous system of Scotland may be\r\narranged in descending order in four divisions, as under--\r\n\r\n4. Coal measures, comprising red sandstone, shales, and marls with no\r\nworkable coals, underlaid by white and grey sandstones and shales with\r\nnumerous valuable coal seams and ironstones.\r\n\r\n3. Millstone grit, consisting of coarse sandstones, with beds of\r\nfireclay, a few thin coals, ironstones, and thin limestones.\r\n\r\n2. Carboniferous limestone series, embracing three subdivisions, the\r\nhighest of which contains three or more limestones with thick beds of\r\nsandstone and some coals, the middle includes several valuable seams of\r\ncoal and ironstone, and the lowest is characterized by several beds of\r\nmarine limestone with sandstone, shales, some coals, and ironstones.\r\n\r\n1. Calciferous sandstone series, forming two subdivisions. The upper\r\nis known as the oil-shale group, and is over 3,000 feet in thickness,\r\nand contains, in its highest part, beds of coal, usually of inferior\r\nquality, and, farther down, about six main seams of oil-shale,\r\ninter-stratified with beds of sandstone, shale, fire-clay, marl, and\r\nestuarine limestones.\r\n\r\nAlthough the calciferous sandstone series is well developed in other\r\nparts of Scotland, it has not hitherto yielded any oil-shale of\r\neconomic importance beyond the limits of West Lothian, Mid Lothian,\r\nand Fife. Thin seams of oil-shale do occur in various places in the\r\ncounties of Haddington and Berwick, but, generally speaking, the\r\nquantity is not sufficient to be practically worked.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to the oil-shales themselves. The shales, as known\r\nin the Lothians, are fine black or brownish clay shales, with certain\r\nspecial features which enable them to be easily distinguished in the\r\nfield. Miners draw a distinction between “plain” and “curly” shale,\r\nthe former variety being flat and smooth, and the latter contorted or\r\n“curled,” and polished or glossy on the squeezed faces. In internal\r\nstructure, oil-shale is minutely laminated, which is apparent in the\r\n“spent” shale after distillation, when it is thrown out in fragments,\r\ncomposed of extremely thin sheets like the leaves of a book.\r\n\r\nBefore touching upon the methods employed in mining the shale and the\r\ntreatment it receives during distillation, it is interesting to note\r\nthat the industry in Scotland has passed through many vicissitudes\r\nsince its establishment. At that time, the American oil industry was\r\nbut in its infancy, and the production in the States was utilized\r\nmainly on the American markets. Consequently, there was a great\r\ndemand for the Scottish oils in this country, and in 1870 there were\r\nno fewer than ninety small oil-works in the Lothians, the majority\r\nof which were operating the shales. It was about this time that the\r\nAmerican illuminating oil came over to this country, and a very\r\nsorry blow was dealt the Scottish industry. So disastrous was the\r\nresulting competition between the Scottish products on the one hand,\r\nand the American and Russian petroleums on the other, that one by\r\none the Scottish companies closed down, and, after less than eight\r\nyears of competition, the number of operating companies had fallen to\r\ntwenty-six. The decay continued until the number of active concerns in\r\nthe Scottish shale-oil industry could be counted on one’s fingers.\r\n\r\nThe industry exists to-day simply as a result of the great improvements\r\nwhich have been made in the retorting of the shale, by which larger\r\nquantities of products are produced--including ammonia. It is thus able\r\nto withstand foreign competition.\r\n\r\nTo-day, it is estimated that nearly 4,000,000 tons of the Scottish\r\nshales are treated every twelve months by the several operating oil\r\ncompanies. The most important of these concerns--the Pumpherston Oil\r\nCompany--has been regularly operating since 1883, and, inasmuch as it\r\ndeals with by far the largest quantities of shale treated, a brief\r\naccount of its operations will be of advantage in enabling the reader\r\nto understand the methods by which a total of nearly 400,000 tons of\r\noil are produced each year in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Pumpherston Oil Company are upon a scale of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, for the Company’s works comprise the crude oil\r\nplant, the sulphate of ammonia plant, oil and wax refineries, etc. The\r\nSeafield and Deans works, 7 and 4 miles distant respectively, possess\r\nonly crude-oil and sulphate-producing plants, the refining plants being\r\nconfined to Pumpherston. The Company’s works cover 100 acres, while\r\nthe shale fields extend over many thousands of acres in and around the\r\ndistrict of Pumpherston.\r\n\r\nAs has already been mentioned, the shale fields so far operated\r\nlie, in the main, in the Lothians, and, as one motors by road from\r\nEdinburgh to Glasgow, the shale country is passed through. Before\r\nthe commercial development of a shale field, trial borings are sunk,\r\nnow more generally by means of a diamond bore, for by its revolving\r\naction a solid core is obtained which readily shows the character and\r\ninclination of the strata passed through. When a seam of shale has been\r\nfound by boring operations, and the exact position and depth of outcrop\r\ndetermined, it is necessary, before sinking a mine, to put down a trial\r\nshaft for the purpose of making sure as to the true gradient at which\r\nthe shale is lying, and the thickness as well as the quality of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIn the shales in the Pumpherston district there are five distinct\r\nseams, dipping from 29 degrees to 38 degrees, and the mine is driven in\r\nthe middle seam, the other seams being entered by level cross-cut mines\r\ndriven from one to another. Each of these seams is worked separately,\r\nthe cross-cut shown in the sketch serving the purposes of communication\r\nand transit. In some cases, where the inclination of the shales is at\r\na different angle, it is necessary to sink a vertical shaft, and this\r\nmethod is applied to the series known as the Mid-Calder.\r\n\r\nThe usual dimensions of the inclined shaft are a width of from 10\r\nto 12 feet, and the height is from 6 to 8 feet. If the sides of the\r\nshaft prove to be of a soft nature, as is generally the case with the\r\nshale at the crop, walls are run up and the roof is supported by larch\r\ncrowns, but, where the shale is hard and the roof good, then the less\r\ncostly method of timbering is adopted.\r\n\r\nThe supports to the roof in many cases are fixed “centre” fashion,\r\ndividing the shaft into two unequal parts. The smaller division has\r\ngenerally a width of just over 3 feet, and is used for haulage ropes\r\nand water pipes, while the larger division is utilized for winding.\r\nDuring the progress of sinking, levels are broken away in the seam at\r\nregular distances, and driven so as to get communication with, and\r\ndrive headings to form, the outer mine. These headings are driven in\r\nthe same direction as the sinking mine to the levels above, until\r\nthey connect with the outer mine or shaft. The outer mine is then\r\nused for winding the shale up to the surface, and the other is kept\r\nfor sinking purposes, and by this means winding and sinking can go on\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF THE PUMPHERSTON WORKS]\r\n\r\nThe seams of shale in the Midlothian fields vary generally from 4 to\r\n10 feet in thickness, say 7 feet as an average, and, on the whole,\r\nthey are comparatively free from ribs of unproductive rock. With a\r\nthickness of 7 feet, experience has shown that the method best adapted\r\nfor the efficient working of the shale is “stoop and room,” but in the\r\ncase of two seams of shale, separated by a bed of foreign material\r\nof sufficient thickness for packing, the long wall method proves the\r\nmore suitable. The “stoop and room” method, however, is more generally\r\nused throughout the Scottish shale district than any other, its chief\r\ncharacteristics being the (1) “whole” or first working, and (2) the\r\nbroken or second working. The whole working consists of a series of\r\nexcavations made in the shale, whereby it is divided into rectangular\r\nblocks or pillars. These excavations are called rooms, one set being\r\ndriven at right angles to the dip of the shale and at regular distances\r\nfrom one another, and commonly called “levels”; another set, driven to\r\nthe rise of these levels and at right angles to them, being usually\r\nknown as “ends” or “upsets.” The latter are broken off the levels at\r\nregular intervals and driven upwards to meet the levels above.\r\n\r\nThe shale miner holes as far as he can reach--probably three or more\r\nfeet--and brings down the shale by blasting, the process being repeated\r\nuntil he penetrates a distance of from 9 to 12 feet from the face at\r\nroad-head. The shale, being loosened from its natural bed, is then\r\nplaced in “hutches,” which are taken to the bottom of the shaft by\r\neither horse or chain haulage (much as with coal), and then the journey\r\nto the mouth is commenced. Before leaving the question of shale mining,\r\nit should be explained that the shale miner is subject to dangers much\r\nas his colleague in the coal-pit, but the volume of gases found in the\r\nshale seams is not so great as in the coal measures. These, however,\r\nare of an explosive nature, the most common being fire-damp.\r\n\r\nOnce above ground, the shale is conveyed to breaking machines by\r\nendless wire-rope haulage. Passing through the machines, it is broken\r\ninto suitable sizes for distillation, and drops into hopper-shaped\r\nhutches. These hutches have a capacity of about a ton, and each in turn\r\nis conveyed to the top of the retorts on an inclined scaffold by an\r\nendless chain. The shale then falls by the operation of a lever into a\r\nhopper or magazine communicating directly with the retorts, one hopper\r\nwith a storage capacity of 24 hours’ supply of shale being connected to\r\neach retort of the Pumpherston Company.\r\n\r\nThis Company’s retorts--they are patented--are in use at the various\r\nworks of the Pumpherston Company, and are an interesting feature to\r\nvisitors. The shale is fed by gravitation into cylindrical-shaped\r\nretorts, and built vertically in ovens of four, each oven having four\r\nchambers. The upper portion is of cast-iron, 11 feet long by 2 feet\r\nin diameter at the top, and slightly enlarged toward the bottom. Heat\r\nis applied externally from the incondensable gases obtained from the\r\ndistillation of the shale, and this heat is made to circulate round\r\nthe retort. In the case of the poorer qualities of the shale, however,\r\nthe heat is assisted by producer-gas. The heating gas enters near\r\nthe bottom portion of the retort, which is of fire-brick, along with\r\na certain quantity of air, and a high temperature--from 1,200°F. to\r\n1,600°F.--is maintained, in this portion converting the nitrogen of the\r\nshale into ammonia, which is preserved by a continuous supply of steam\r\ndelivered at a slight pressure at the bottom of the hopper.\r\n\r\nThe oil gases are distilled from the shale in the cast-iron portion\r\nof the retort at a temperature of about 900° F., and, along with the\r\nammonia gas, are drawn off by the exhausters through a branch pipe\r\nat the top of the retort, through the atmospheric condensers, from\r\nwhich the condensed liquid oil and water containing ammonia flow into\r\na small separator tank. It is here that, owing to their different\r\nspecific gravities--for one is lighter than the other--they assume\r\ndifferent levels, and are thus drawn off into separate tanks. The\r\ngases then pass through ammonia scrubbers, in which they are washed\r\nfor ammonia, and then through the naphtha scrubbers, where the lighter\r\ngases, which could not be caught in the atmospheric condensers,\r\nare washed with oil and a good quality of light oil or naphtha is\r\nrecovered. The incondensable portion passing from these scrubbers is\r\nburned in the retorts as previously mentioned. With a shale of average\r\nyield, the retort can be heated by these incondensable gases from the\r\ndistillation, and a surplus obtained for burning under steam boilers.\r\n\r\nWhat is doubtless a very unique feature of the Pumpherston retort\r\nis the mechanical arrangement for withdrawing the spent shale\r\ncontinuously, and thus keeping the whole mass inside the retorts in\r\nconstant movement. Below each pair of retorts is fixed a hopper made\r\nof cast-iron, and fixed to girders supported on the brick piers or\r\ncolumns between the ovens. At the top of each hopper, and immediately\r\nunderneath the bottom of the retorts, is fixed a cast-iron disc or\r\ntable, with a space left between its edge and the sides of the hopper.\r\nThe whole mass of shale in the retort rests upon the table, the space\r\npermitting some to pass over the edge. Through the centre of the table\r\na steel spindle projects, on the upper end of which is fixed a curved\r\narm, and this, when rotated, pushes some of the shale off, causing it\r\nto fall over the edge of the table into the hopper below. The shaft\r\ncarrying the curved arm passes through a stuffing-box on the hopper,\r\nand has a ratchet and lever fitted to the lower end, actuated by a\r\nrod of T-iron which is made to travel horizontally, and is driven by\r\na small electric motor. The motion is comparatively slow, the arm\r\nmaking but one revolution in about 20 minutes, but the action is most\r\nsatisfactory, the through-put of shale being regulated at will.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia water got from the atmospheric condensers is pumped through\r\na heater, in which it is raised in temperature by the waste water\r\nflowing from the still, and passes into the top of the still, which is\r\ncircular in shape, about 30 feet high, and has a series of cast-iron\r\nshelves or trays fixed horizontally every 2 feet or thereabouts from\r\nthe top to near the bottom. Steam is put into the bottom of the still\r\nat a pressure of 40 lb., and passes to the top through a series of\r\nconical arrangements on the shelves carrying with it the volatile\r\nammonia, while the water, after traversing the whole area of each tray,\r\npasses out into a concrete tank containing a cast-iron worm, which is\r\nthe heater already referred to, for the ammonia water on its way to the\r\nstill. During its progress from the top to the bottom of the still, the\r\nwater is diverted into a chamber containing milk of lime, setting free\r\nthe fixed ammonia which cannot be got by steaming.\r\n\r\nThe steam and ammonia gas liberated in the still pass over into a\r\nlarge lead-lined tub or saturator, and bubbles through holes in a\r\nlead worm placed round the circumference at the bottom of the vessel.\r\nSulphuric acid is at the same time run into the saturator, and, at\r\na certain temperature, sulphate of ammonia is formed. The sulphate\r\nfalls into a well, formed in the centre of the bottom of the vessel,\r\nin which are placed two steam ejectors, and these blow it out along\r\nwith some liquor. This mixture is delivered into hutches having\r\nperforated bottoms, through which the ammonia liquor drains off, the\r\nsolid sulphate being left in the hutch. This is now run by an overhead\r\nrailway to the drying or storage stalls, and from these it is packed\r\nup and dispatched to the market. The exhaust steam and waste gases\r\nfrom the saturator are passed into the retorts, and utilized for the\r\nformation of ammonia from the shale, while the spent water is pumped to\r\nthe spent shale bing, and thoroughly filtered before being allowed to\r\nescape from the works.\r\n\r\nFor dealing with the weak acid water recovered from the refinery, the\r\nPumpherston plant consists of lead-lined tubs or crackers, into which\r\na quantity of the acid water is run, and saturated with ammonia gas\r\nuntil it is near the salting point, when it gravitates into settling\r\nvessels in order to separate any tar carried over with the acid water.\r\nThe clear liquid is then drawn into the saturator, where it is quickly\r\nconverted into sulphate and blown out in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nSo up to date is the whole of the system governing the treatment of the\r\nshales and the resulting products, that the pumping of water from the\r\nmines, the haulage of the shale to the refineries, as well as driving\r\nof machinery in the works, is performed by electric power, the exhaust\r\nsteam from the engines driving the generators, as in the case of the\r\nsulphate of ammonia exhaust, being sent to the retorts for use in the\r\nproduction of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe process of refining the crude oil obtained from the shale into\r\nthe various products is somewhat complicated and perplexing to those\r\nunassociated with the industry on account of the many distillations\r\nand treatments which have to be carried out before a good marketable\r\narticle is produced. The following outline, however, will give a fair\r\nidea of the process adopted throughout Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe crude oil is delivered at the refinery into large tanks, which\r\nare placed at a sufficient height to feed the stills by gravitation.\r\nThe crude oil is allowed to settle for twelve or more hours at a\r\ntemperature sufficiently high to separate any water that may have\r\npassed the test at the retorts, and after this water has been run\r\noff, the oil is fed into the centre boiler of a battery of oil\r\nboilers. The lightest fraction of the oil--ultimately motor spirit and\r\nilluminating oils--is distilled off the feeding boiler and condensed\r\nin a coil of cast-iron pipes immersed in water in a tank, cold water\r\nbeing continuously run into the tank, while heated water is run off.\r\nThe boilers on each side of the feed vessel receive their oil by a\r\npipe connecting with the bottom of the latter, and they also distil\r\nover the lighter portion of oil with which they have been fed, the\r\nheavier portions passing on to a third boiler, where the process of\r\ndistillation is repeated.\r\n\r\nThe oil now left is delivered into a cast-iron pot-still, in which\r\nit is ultimately distilled to dryness, the residue left in the still\r\nforming oil coke, which is valuable as a fuel on account of its high\r\npercentage of fixed carbon and low yield of ash. Steam is admitted to\r\nthe still in large quantities at all distillations. The various stages\r\nof distillation are carried through in almost identically the same\r\nmanner as that of crude oil, and, therefore, need not be described in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe treatment or washing of the oil to remove the impurities that\r\ncannot be eliminated by distillation, consists in stirring the oil\r\nby compressed air for a given time in an iron vessel, with a fixed\r\nquantity of sulphuric acid, allowing it to settle, and running off the\r\nheavy mixture of tar and acid which separates. The acid-treated oil\r\nis then run into another similar vessel, treated with a solution of\r\ncaustic soda, settles, and the soda tar which separates is run off.\r\nThe acid tars are steamed and washed, the resulting acid water being\r\nsent to the sulphate of ammonia house for the manufacture of sulphate\r\nof ammonia, whilst the tar is mixed with that from the soda treatments\r\nand burned under the stills as liquid oil. As there is more than\r\nsufficient of this tar to distil all the oil at the various stages,\r\nthe distillation is carried out without cost for fuel, excepting that\r\nnecessary for steam-raising purposes.\r\n\r\nA portion of the oil distilled at the second distillation, or green\r\noil stage, is sent from the stills to the paraffin sheds to be cooled\r\nand the scale extracted, this eventually being made into paraffin wax.\r\nStored in tanks until brought down to atmospheric temperature, the\r\noil is pumped into the inner chamber of a cooler, which consists of a\r\nseries of four vessels having inner and outer compartments. At the same\r\ntime, anhydrous ammonia is forced into the outer compartment or jacket,\r\nand absorbs heat from the cooler, freezing the oil in the inner jacket\r\ninto a pasty mixture of liquid oil and solid crystals of wax.\r\n\r\nThis mixture is then pumped into filter-presses, where a portion of\r\nthe oil flows away through the cloth, while the wax is left behind\r\nin solid cakes, still containing a quantity of oil. These cakes are\r\ndelivered by conveyors to the back of the hydraulic presses, where\r\nthey are wrapped in cloth and placed on shelves between iron frames in\r\nthe presses, most of the remaining oils being thus squeezed out. The\r\nmaterial obtained from the hydraulic presses is known to the trade as\r\nparaffin scale, and as it is discoloured by the small quantity of oil\r\nwhich cannot be removed by pressing, a process of sweating by steaming\r\nin large brick compartments is adopted, in order to remove the oil.\r\nThe scale, consequent upon the removal of the oil therefrom, becomes\r\nwhiter and of higher melting point, and after further treatment is\r\nfinally passed through filter paper and run into moulding trays. When\r\ncooled, this product is known as paraffin wax, of which there are many\r\ngrades. One cannot enter into the technical arrangements involved, for\r\nobvious reasons, the chief one of which is that these cannot interest\r\nthe reader; but sufficient has already been written in this chapter to\r\nsuggest to the reader the perfection which has now been reached in the\r\ntreatment of the shales of the Midlothians.\r\n\r\nAs to the future, it is full of promise. There is no doubt that for\r\nmany years to come the full force of foreign competition, as it has\r\nexisted in previous times, will not be felt. There is a free field\r\nfor Scottish enterprise in connection with the distillation of its\r\noil-bearing shales. Nor is the region for development limited to its\r\npresent area. Reports point to the fact that much area of commercial\r\nground exists, not only on the eastern side of Scotland, but also in\r\nthe north and north-west, while it is already an open secret that\r\nthose responsible for the conduct of Government operations are viewing\r\nwith favour even the liquid extraction of oil from certain areas not\r\nfar distant from the zone of the present operations. The Scottish\r\nshale-oil industry has, so far, managed to defy competition from abroad\r\nto an extent which is reflected in the balance sheets of the several\r\noperating companies, whose yearly dividends have been from 50 per cent.\r\ndownward during recent years.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, and that is, the Government is well aware that\r\nthere are great possibilities associated with the shale-oil industry\r\nof Scotland, and it is not only watching developments with direct\r\ninterest, but is doing all in its power to foster the industry, and\r\nby all means possible encourage the exploitation of areas so far\r\nnot commercially developed. At some future date there is a great\r\npossibility that the present area for developments will be largely\r\nextended, and as this is written, there is much evidence forthcoming to\r\nsuggest that this commercial development of new lands will not long be\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA FEW NOTABLE PETROLEUM ENTERPRISES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo brief survey of the petroleum industry would be complete were\r\nreference not made to a few of those remarkable commercial undertakings\r\nin various parts of the world whose interests are not only closely\r\nassociated with it, but to whose energies has been due much of the\r\nexpansion that has been witnessed in every direction during the past\r\nfew decades. It is safe to assert that, had it not been that the\r\npetroleum industry has, in its various industrial and commercial\r\naspects attracted the attention of some of the finest financial and\r\nbusiness houses in the world, the wonderful progress which has been\r\nrecorded would, for the most part, have been impossible.\r\n\r\nThe first place must of necessity be given to that much maligned\r\namalgamation of capital, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which\r\nwas formed as far back as 36 years ago by Mr. John D. Rockefeller\r\nand his associates for the primary purpose of developments in the\r\npetroleum industry of the United States. At that time, the petroleum\r\nproduction of America had become quite a factor in commerce, but it\r\nwas, obviously, in want of a guiding hand which could not only place\r\nit upon a basis of solidity, but which would tend to remove much of\r\nthat gambling element which had become almost part and parcel of all\r\ndevelopments. The Company, at the head of which were several gentlemen\r\nwho had already made themselves famous in the land of oil, launched out\r\nin several directions, and, through the numerous subsidiary concerns\r\nwhich it soon created, it owned very extensive oil-bearing properties\r\nin practically every oil-field of the States, while it built quite a\r\nnetwork of pipe-lines for the conveyance of the oil from the fields to\r\nthe refineries, and from the refineries to seaboard. It erected and\r\nequipped oil refineries, and, so as to provide the much-needed foreign\r\nmarkets for American petroleum products, it built its fleet of oil\r\ntankers; and, lastly, opened depots for the distribution of American\r\npetroleum products all the world over.\r\n\r\nAt one time, the ultimate success of its vast operations was open to\r\nquestion, and many there were who predicted that one day it would\r\nignominiously pass on to the list of oil failures. Indeed, it nearly\r\ncame to this on one or two occasions, and it was only owing to the\r\nremarkable perseverance of those at the head of the Company’s affairs\r\nthat prevented headlong disaster. The Standard Oil Company soon became\r\nan integral part of the petroleum industry of the United States,\r\nwith which it grew up and steadily assumed a position of world-wide\r\nimportance, though one which was not unassailable. Its ultimate success\r\nwas the chief cause for the multiplication of its critics, and volumes\r\nhave been written of its wrong-doings by writers whose knowledge of\r\nthe petroleum industry was mostly based upon wilful ignorance of\r\nfacts. Consequent upon a decision of the United States Supreme Court\r\nsome seven years ago, which held that the Company was violating the\r\nAnti-Trust Law of 1890, the Standard had to rid itself of its various\r\nsubsidiary companies (over thirty in number), but it still controls\r\nalmost a similar number of concerns to-day which are actively engaged\r\nin the production of crude oil and natural gas. It also owns several of\r\nthe largest refineries in the States, while its fleet of oil tankers\r\nwill, when present building is completed, be considerably over 300,000\r\ntonnage. Its capital is $100,000,000, and during the last twelve\r\nyears it has paid in dividends over 400 per cent., in addition to an\r\nadditional cash distribution of 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil Company of New York is another immense concern\r\nwhich, with a capital of $75,000,000, has its headquarters in the\r\nStandard’s palatial building at 26 Broadway, New York, and interested\r\nprincipally in the refining industry, its facilities permitting of\r\n20,000 barrels of crude oil being treated daily. Another very prominent\r\ncompany is the Standard Oil Company of California, with its capital\r\nof $100,000,000. This Company not only produces its crude oil, but\r\nrefines it, and engages in the export business. Its refinery at Point\r\nRichmond, California, is reported to be the largest in the world, for\r\nit can treat 65,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its fleet of tankers\r\nand barges for the export trade is capable of carrying at one trip over\r\n100,000 tons of products, and, for the purposes of its land transport,\r\nit possesses pipe-lines over 1,000 miles long.\r\n\r\nThe second place of importance in regard to the petroleum enterprises\r\nof international influence must be given to the “Shell” Transport\r\nand Trading Company, Ltd., whose headquarters are in London, with\r\nthat well-known oil pioneer, Sir Marcus Samuel, Bart., as its\r\nChairman. Formed just over twenty years ago for dealing primarily as\r\na transporter of petroleum products in the Far East, the “Shell” has\r\nsteadily and continuously extended the sphere of its operations, until\r\nthe result of a carefully thought out policy is seen in its activities\r\nin almost every oil-field of the world. Just over ten years ago, the\r\nCompany made an amalgamation with the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company,\r\nor, to give it its correct name, the Koninklijke Nederlandsche\r\nMaatschappij tot exploitatie van petroleum-bronnen in Nederlandsch\r\nIndie (whose capital is £12,500,000), and by reason of so doing it\r\nmaterially increased its international position and importance. The\r\n“Shell”--Royal Dutch Combine to-day has a controlling interest in some\r\nof the largest operating companies in Russia, Roumania, California,\r\nMexico, Venezuela, and other oil regions, one of its most recent\r\nextensions being in its advent into the petroleum industry of Trinidad.\r\nThe “Shell” Company has a record for successful industrial expansion\r\nwhich is achieved by few companies in the world of commerce: its\r\ncapital is now £15,000,000, and in dividends it has distributed over\r\n300 per cent. Among the “Shell” Company’s associated concerns, that\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, Ltd., which is responsible for\r\nthe ocean transportation of the petroleum products of the Combine,\r\ntakes first place, with its capital of £8,000,000; while the Asiatic\r\nPetroleum Company, Ltd. (capital, £2,000,000), ranks but second. The\r\nrecent fusion of the interests of Lord Cowdray with those of the\r\n“Shell,” for the latter has acquired the control of the great Mexican\r\ninterests associated with the Pearson company, is another instance of\r\nhow the “Shell” Company has trod the road of progress and expansion.\r\n\r\nThe sudden rise to fame of the oil-fields of Mexico gave birth to what\r\nmay safely be referred to as one of the most enterprising amalgamations\r\nof capital in the long list of concerns associated with the petroleum\r\nindustry, and it is gratifying to note that this enterprise was solely\r\ndue to the well-known firm of Messrs. S. Pearson & Sons. Lord Cowdray,\r\nas the head, was not slow to recognize the vast opportunities which\r\nawaited the development of the Mexican fields, and the formation of the\r\nMexican Eagle Oil Company, in 1908, with a capital of now $60,000,000\r\n(Mexican), or about £6,125,000 sterling, was the initial result of his\r\nefforts. It was just about this time that the serious fuel oil era\r\nopened, both in this country and others, and it was evident that, for\r\nthe purpose of adequately distributing the products of Mexican oil (and\r\nthese include the whole range of refined oils, as well as fuel oil),\r\nthere was room for the operations of a large and influential company.\r\nThe Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company, Ltd., was accordingly formed, with\r\nLord Cowdray’s son (the Hon. B. C. Pearson) as Chairman, and a capital\r\nof £2,000,000, to deal with the importation and distribution of Mexican\r\npetroleum products on the English market.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the control of this Company has now passed under the\r\n“Shell,” and its future expansion is assured, both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican products are transported from Mexico to this country, as\r\nwell as many others, by the large fleet of Eagle oil tankers, the\r\nproperty of the Eagle Oil Transport Company, Ltd., which admirably\r\nmanaged concern of £3,000,000 capital is also presided over by the Hon.\r\nB. C. Pearson. The Eagle Company possesses the largest oil tankers\r\nafloat, many of them carrying over 15,000 tons of bulk oil, though\r\nothers to be built are to be considerably larger; an 18,000 ton tanker\r\nis, indeed, already in commission.\r\n\r\nAnother highly important enterprise in the world of petroleum is that\r\nof the Burmah Oil Company, Ltd., which, as its name suggests, is\r\noccupied with the petroleum industry in Burmah, and catering for the\r\nalmost unlimited needs of the Far East in regard to refined petroleum\r\nproducts. It controls enormous acres of oil-bearing territory held\r\nunder lease from the Burmah Government, possesses extensive refineries\r\nat Rangoon, and has quite a fleet of oil tankers. Its capital is\r\nthree and a half millions sterling, and its consistent success may be\r\njudged from the fact that it has paid over 400 per cent. in dividends.\r\nOf comparatively recent date, the Burmah Oil Company has turned its\r\nattention to other fields, particularly to Trinidad, but it is in\r\nconnection with the development and subsequent operations of the fields\r\nof Burmah that the Company is chiefly concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., which is closely allied to the\r\nBurmah Oil Company (capital, £6,000,000) by reason of its large\r\ninterest therein, has come into prominence during recent years,\r\nowing mainly to its agreement with the British Government, in which\r\nthe latter has invested over £4,000,000 of the public moneys in\r\nthe enterprise. The Company acquired its petroliferous concessions\r\nfrom several interests, including the Burmah Oil Company and the\r\nlate Lord Strathcona, which had been granted to them by the Persian\r\nGovernment. When I mention that the Company’s concessions cover an\r\narea of, approximately, half a million square miles, and on which\r\npetroleum has been found in quantity on the majority of the small\r\nareas already examined, the significance of the enterprise will be\r\nsomewhat appreciated. There is no doubt that the company’s success is\r\ndoubly assured, and, from this point of view, the investment of the\r\npublic moneys in the undertaking has been sound finance, especially\r\nwhen one considers the important part which petroleum products\r\nunder British control must hereafter play. As a matter of fact, the\r\nproposition is a well-paying one to-day, and it is asserted that the\r\nGovernment’s interest is already worth no less than £20,000,000. Persia\r\nas an oil-producing country will occupy a very prominent place. The\r\nCompany has immense petroleum-producing fields: it has its pipe-line\r\nto seaboard, and its refineries, situate on the Persian Gulf. It\r\nhas possibilities without end, and it is rapidly availing itself of\r\nthem. The Company also now owns the entire capital of three formerly\r\nGerman-owned concerns in London--the British Petroleum Company,\r\nLtd., the Homelight Oil Company, Ltd., and the Petroleum Steamship\r\nCompany, Ltd. Consequent upon these acquisitions, the Anglo-Persian\r\nCompany, Ltd., is making arrangements to enter the English market as\r\ndistributors of Persian petroleum. The question of transport need\r\nnot here be considered, for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company owns the\r\nentire capital of the British Tanker Co., Ltd. The Company thus has\r\nthe producing and refining possibilities: the acquired concern of the\r\nTanker Company, together with that of the Petroleum Steamship Co.,\r\nwill suffice to bring its products to the English market, while the\r\nlarge distributing organizations of the British Petroleum Company and\r\nthe Homelight Oil Company, owning depots all over the country, will\r\noffer easy facilities for the distribution of the petroleum products\r\nimported. My argument all along has been that the advent of the British\r\nGovernment into this enterprise--I will not call it a speculation,\r\nthough at one time it looked like it--places all that private\r\nenterprise, which in the past has brought all the products of petroleum\r\nto our own doors at a reasonable and competitive price, at absolute\r\ndiscount. Ever since the petroleum industry assumed proportions of\r\ninternational magnitude, and we became more or less (I should have said\r\nmore than less) dependent upon our necessities being met by petroleum\r\nand its products, private enterprise has always kept us well supplied.\r\nBut the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has made immense headway since the\r\nGovernment took an interest in its operations, and its appearance on\r\nthe English market as a refiner of Persian crude oil and a distributor\r\nof the products thereof, is but a reflection of the prolific nature\r\nof the vast fields in Persia which it possesses. It has decided upon\r\nhaving its first English oil refinery near Swansea, and it is reported\r\nthat this will be in operation before the end of 1920. It has also\r\nsecured the control of the Scottish shale oil refineries which will be\r\nused for the treatment of Persian crude oil when occasion warrants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FEW OF THE BURMAH COMPANY’S PROLIFIC PRODUCERS]\r\n\r\nOne might go on to interminable length in briefly referring to the\r\ngreat concerns whose operations have been responsible for the expansion\r\nof the world’s petroleum industry to its present magnitude, but the\r\nexigencies of space prevent this. The brief list of companies already\r\nreferred to represents an amalgamation of capital to the extent of\r\nnearly £120,000,000 sterling, though this cannot be considered as\r\nrepresenting more than one-half the total world’s investments in\r\npetroleum enterprises.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have not touched with the magnitude of the petroleum\r\ncompanies operating in the distributing oil trade of England, though,\r\nto some extent, this may be gathered from the references to such\r\ncompanies as the “Shell,” the Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company, etc.\r\n\r\nPractically the first company of any magnitude to distribute petroleum\r\nproducts in this country was the Anglo-American Oil Co., Ltd., which\r\nhas actively engaged in this branch of commerce for the past thirty\r\nyears. It imported and dealt in American oils long before the advent of\r\nthe companies before mentioned, and, to-day, is certainly one of the\r\nlargest--if not the largest--company so engaged. Its name is known in\r\nevery hamlet in the country: its tank cars are seen on every railway,\r\nand its depots are to be found in every centre throughout the length\r\nand breadth of the land. Its name is legion. Its capital is £3,000,000,\r\nand it is to the Anglo-American Oil Company that, throughout the\r\nclatter of European War, the credit is due for having supplied us with\r\nthose almost unlimited quantities of petroleum products so necessary\r\nboth on sea and land, for it is the largest importer in the Kingdom.\r\nAs its name implies, the “Anglo” deals mostly in American petroleum\r\nproducts: it was at one time the importing concern of the Standard\r\nOil Company, but to-day it purchases broadcast in an endeavour--and a\r\nvery successful one, too--to supply the British consumer with all the\r\npetroleum products he requires.\r\n\r\nThe present chapter deals, I feel, most inadequately with the general\r\nquestion of concerns whose interests are directly allied with that of\r\npetroleum; in fact, it was not my desire to give an encyclopaedia of\r\nthe thousands of companies so engaged, but, rather, to suggest the\r\nnames of a few which have secured world-wide distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD’S OUTPUT OF PETROLEUM\r\n\r\nThe world’s total production of crude oil for 1917, and for the period\r\nof years 1857 to 1917, is given in the following table.
