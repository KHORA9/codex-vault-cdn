At Gehzireh,\r\nthe gardens of the Khedive of Egypt at Cairo, it has been known\r\nto grow nine inches in a single night. At Syon House, the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland's, stems of \"_Bambusa Gigantea_\" have attained the\r\nheight of 60 feet in 12 weeks; and I have made \"_Paper-Stock_\" from a\r\nstem of \"_Bambusa Vulgaris_,\" sent me by Dr. Hooker, from the Royal\r\nBotanical Gardens at Kew, which, as measured by the gardener in the\r\nPalm-house, grew at the rate of three feet in a single week; at\r\nChatsworth, the Duke of Devonshire's, this same variety (the \"_Bambusa\r\nVulgaris_\") has attained the height of 40 feet in 40 days.\r\n\r\nThroughout the East Indies the \"Bamboo\" flourishes, forming indeed\r\nin many districts impenetrable jungles. It grows abundantly also in\r\nthe West Indies, in Central and South America, the Brazils, in Africa\r\nand Asia; in China especially, and in Japan, the plant is indigenous,\r\nand the natives cultivate it carefully, employing it for almost every\r\narticle of convenience and luxury; in fact, wherever heat and moisture\r\nexist, some species of the \"Bamboo\" will be found, or may be readily\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nAttempts have from time to time been made in England, and elsewhere,\r\nto obtain from the \"BAMBOO\" \"_Half-stuff_\" or \"_Pulp_\" suitable for\r\nthe manufacture of paper, and paper indeed has been made therefrom,\r\nbut hitherto these attempts have neither industrially nor commercially\r\nattained successful results, and for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nHitherto the \"BAMBOO\" has been collected and treated in a condition\r\nmore or less of maturity, or without regard to its age; and when the\r\nplant has attained its full growth the woody fibre is extremely dense\r\nand indurated; when old, indeed, the exterior portion of the stem of\r\nmany varieties of the plant becomes so hard and silicious that it will,\r\nlike flint, strike fire with steel.\r\n\r\nOwing to the presence of this large quantity of silica, and the extreme\r\nhardness of the stem when developed and matured, it has been found by\r\nall those who have hitherto experimentally treated \"BAMBOO\" that the\r\nonly possible means of converting it into _Pulp_ for Paper-making, has\r\nbeen to subject it to long-continued boiling, or digesting, in very\r\nstrong solutions of caustic alkali, at an elevated temperature--in\r\nother words, at or under a pressure of ten to eleven atmospheres\r\n(150 to 160 lb. pressure per square inch)--by which means a _Pulp_\r\nhas certainly been produced, but at a great cost, and the danger and\r\npractical difficulties of working under such high pressure, have\r\ndeterred further progress in this direction.\r\n\r\nI have found that when the stems of \"Bamboo,\" are cut down at an early\r\nstage of their growth, when the plant is full of sap, and before the\r\ncellulose or cellular tissue, and the lignine have become indurated,\r\nand silica deposited; while, in fact, so to speak, the plant may be\r\ntermed a succulent vegetable, and before it has become converted into\r\nwood, that a very mild system of treatment in successive weak alkaline\r\nbaths, at atmospheric pressure only, suffices to decompose and render\r\nsoluble the mucilaginous and other extractive compounds combined\r\nnaturally with the fibrous tissue of the plant, so that they may be\r\nreadily eliminated, or separated therefrom, by subsequent washing,\r\nleaving the residuary fibres pure and free.\r\n\r\nA comparative illustration of the transitional stage of growth above\r\nreferred to, showing the conversion of succulent vegetable fibrous\r\ntissue, into harsh woody fibre, may be remarked with \"Asparagus,\"\r\nthe young and green stems of which, are used as a delicacy for the\r\ntable, a few weeks further growth converting them into hard woody\r\nfibre, which no amount of boiling would, or could, render palatable;\r\nthe \"Asparagus,\" indeed, has its parallel in the \"_Bambusa Edulis_,\" a\r\nvariety of \"BAMBOO,\" the young stems of which are eaten and considered\r\nvery nourishing.\r\n\r\nThe \"BAMBOO,\" being an _endogenous_ plant, (that is to say, growing\r\nfrom inside) composed mainly of fibrous tissue, combined with the\r\nordinary sappy and other extractive matter common to all vegetable\r\ngrowth, the stems do not require the elaborate preparatory manipulation\r\nwhich is necessary to separate the fibrous, from the extraneous and\r\nwoody matter, which in _exogenous_ plants (i. e. growing from, or on\r\nthe outside) must be removed, as it is only the true fibre which is\r\nuseable for Textile Manufactures.\r\n\r\nSuch plants known to commerce as \"FLAX,\" \"HEMP,\" \"JUTE,\" \"RHEA,\" &c.\r\n&c., after having become mature, and being dried, have to undergo a\r\nprocess of retting, or steeping, followed by scutching and heckling, in\r\norder to separate the ultimate fibres from the woody stem and bark to\r\nwhich, while in their normal condition, they are attached.\r\n\r\nThe cost therefore, of producing merchantable fibre from this class of\r\nplants is very considerable, and the produce or yield of fibre, to the\r\nplant cultivated, very small, that of \"FLAX\" being computed at from 5\r\nto 6 cwt., \"HEMP\" 7 cwt., and \"JUTE\" 5 to 6 cwt. per acre, \"COTTON\"\r\nbeing much less; \"BAMBOO,\" as I will presently show, producing tons as\r\ncompared with cwts. of the foregoing, and, be it noted, with far less\r\ncost for cultivation, and the subsequent preparation of the fibre.\r\n\r\nThe stems of the \"BAMBOO,\" cut young, as I propose to use them,\r\ncontain from 60 to 75 per cent. of moisture; it will be obvious,\r\ntherefore, that to ensure a regular and continuous supply, under\r\neconomical conditions, to a central factory for the manufacture of\r\n\"_Paper-Stock_,\" plantations would have to be formed contiguous\r\nthereto, as practised with \"SUGAR CANE,\" or in a similar manner to\r\nOsier beds, in England.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the latter, as in order to stimulate a rapid, aqueous,\r\nand sappy growth, as also to provide for the dry seasons common to hot\r\ncountries, a system of irrigation would be necessary, such a system\r\nindeed being at present practised with the SUGAR CANE, in Egypt, Spain,\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith plantations of \"Sugar Cane,\" to which plant the \"BAMBOO\" somewhat\r\nassimilates in character and growth, it is necessary, in order to\r\nripen the canes and develop saccharine, to allow free ventilation to\r\nthe growing plant, and thus the ground is not fully occupied; this\r\nwould not be the case with \"BAMBOO,\" which should be planted and grown\r\nclosely together to favour the stems shooting upwards, as practised\r\nwith \"HEMP\" and \"FLAX,\" where fine staple of fibre is desired.\r\n\r\nBy following such a system, the stools or roots once established, a\r\nsystematical and regular cropping, or cutting, would ensue, the stems\r\nbeing all cut down simultaneously, by sections or beds, in regular\r\nsuccession, numerous croppings annually would thus be obtained, and\r\nwhen necessary, fresh beds would be formed, the older growth being\r\navailable for fuel for the manufactory.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Cane from the time of planting, to cutting, takes from nine\r\nto twelve months to grow and mature; but even thus grown, the produce\r\nof canes (ready dressed for the mill) generally ranges from 30 to 35\r\ntons to the acre, it sometimes exceeds 40 tons; allowing several crops\r\nor cuttings annually for the \"BAMBOO,\" it may fairly be assumed that at\r\nleast this latter quantity would be obtained per acre.\r\n\r\nAllowing 208 feet square to represent one acre; divided into twelve\r\nbeds, each 96 × 26 feet, with twelve paths 96´ × 8´ 8´´ wide, and one\r\nintersecting road 208 × 16 feet wide, leaves a space for planting equal\r\nto 2496 feet, or 29,952 feet in the twelve beds; allowing the stems to\r\nbe 2 feet apart, and say only 12 feet high, we have 7488 stems, which\r\nat 12 lb. each = 40 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the \"_Bambusa Vulgaris_\" before mentioned, grown in\r\nthe Palm-house at Kew, was of an average size, 10 to 11 inches\r\ncircumference, and weighed green 1-1/2 lb. per foot run; and although\r\nno doubt by denser growth, induced by frequent cropping, the stems\r\neven of the larger varieties of \"BAMBOO\" would decrease in size, still\r\nan equal tonnage to the acre would be produced, with longer joints or\r\ninternodes, and a finer staple of fibre.\r\n\r\nThe stems of the \"BAMBOO\" (_taken as dry_) treated by my process, will\r\nyield 60 per cent. of unbleached _Fibrous_ \"_Paper-Stock_,\" baled up\r\nin merchantable condition; assuming therefore an annual cropping of 40\r\ntons, green stems, which will lose 75 per cent. moisture in drying, we\r\nhave 10 tons dry stems per acre; these at 60 per cent. yield, will give\r\n6 tons per acre of \"_Paper-Stock_,\" an enormous product as compared\r\nwith any other fibrous material with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nAllowing the plantation to be credited at the rate of 5_s._ per ton,\r\nfor the green stems, delivered to the central factory, and 40 tons to\r\nbe produced per acre, we have the sum of 10_l._ per acre to cover all\r\ncharges; once, however, the plantation formed, but little cost in the\r\nway of cultivation need be incurred. The main outlay would be for rent,\r\nirrigation, and cutting, and carrying to the manufactory.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that I propose where possible, to return to the\r\n_Plantation_, mixed with the water employed for irrigation, the\r\nmucilaginous and other extractive constituents, or matters, (amounting\r\nto 40 per cent.) abstracted from the stems during the process of\r\nmanufacturing the \"_Paper-Stock_,\" as Manure, thus maintaining\r\nfertilization to the growing plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILS OF MY SYSTEM OF TREATING \"BAMBOO\" FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF\r\nFIBROUS \"_Paper-Stock_.\"\r\n\r\nAn essential point in my system for treating \"BAMBOO\" to produce\r\ntherefrom fibrous \"_Paper-Stock_,\" consists in operating upon the stems\r\nof the plant when young, and preferably when fresh, as, and when, cut\r\nand collected.\r\n\r\nBrought therefore to a central factory in this condition, the stems\r\nare passed through heavy crushing rolls, in order to split and flatten\r\nthem, and at the same time crush, or smash, the knots, or nodes. The\r\nstems thus flattened, are then passed through a second series of\r\nrolls, which are channelled, or grooved, in order further to split, or\r\npartially divide them longitudinally into strips, or ribbons; these\r\nbeing cut transversely, into convenient lengths by a guillotine knife\r\nor shears, are delivered by a carrier, or automatic feeder, direct to\r\nthe boiling pans, or elsewhere, as desired.\r\n\r\nAs the stems when fresh and green, contain from 60 to 75 per cent.\r\nof sappy and mucilaginous matter, much of this is expressed by the\r\ncrushing, while at the same time the fibrous mass, being partially\r\ndisintegrated, is thus more readily acted upon in the succeeding\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the crushed stems may be dried and stored; such drying,\r\nhowever, must be very carefully conducted and watched to avoid\r\ndestructive fermentation.\r\n\r\nI have in the preceding \"Remarks\" referred to \"FLAX,\" \"HEMP,\"\r\n\"JUTE,\" and similar FIBRES known to commerce, such fibres being\r\nimported into this country in their prepared condition, suitable for\r\nTextile purposes. They have, in fact, passed through a process of\r\nsemi-manufacture, such process, as I have explained, being required\r\nto separate the ultimate fibres from the interior woody stem to which\r\nwhen growing they are attached; and it is obvious that it would not be\r\n(economically) possible to import any of these fibrous plants as grown\r\nor produced, owing to their enormous bulk in that condition.\r\n\r\nNow although the stems of the \"BAMBOO,\" after cutting and crushing,\r\nmay, as I have shown, be dried (and will when dried give a yield of\r\n60 per cent. of fibre), still their bulk and extreme lightness would\r\npreclude importing them to this country in their _raw_ condition, not\r\nmerely from their heavy cost for carriage, but from their liability\r\nto damage from fermentation. For these economical considerations,\r\ntherefore, I propose to reduce the \"BAMBOO\" into \"_Fibrous-Stock_\"\r\nwhere grown or produced.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before entering into details of the process, briefly\r\nto explain the ordinary system employed for preparing fibres, or\r\nfibrous materials, as also rags, for Paper-making. This consists in\r\nsorting, cutting, cleaning, and, if need be, roughly opening them,\r\nfollowed by boiling in alkaline leys, after which they are well washed\r\nuntil cleansed from impurities in what is technically termed the rag\r\nor breaker engine, during which operation they are disintegrated or\r\nreduced into \"_Half-stuff_,\" or _semi-pulp_, this being subsequently\r\nbleached and converted into pulp and paper.\r\n\r\nAs the object of my process is to produce a fibrous or tow-like\r\n_Stock_, retaining as far as possible the normal or natural condition\r\nof the fibre, and not \"_Half-stuff_\" or \"_Pulp_,\" my system of\r\ntreatment differs materially from the foregoing, more especially in the\r\nboiling and washing processes.\r\n\r\nBoth of these processes I conduct in a battery, or series of vessels\r\n(16, 20, or more in number), such vessels being connected together\r\nby pipes, or channels, furnished with valves, or cocks, so that\r\ncommunication between the individual vessels may be maintained,\r\ndisconnected, and regulated as desired, in such manner that the\r\nvessels, being methodically charged in succession with the material to\r\nbe operated upon, the heated leys (composed of caustic alkali) can be\r\nprogressively conducted from vessel to vessel of the series, passing\r\nover and through the material placed therein.\r\n\r\nThe leys are thus used again and again, (each successive change,\r\nor charge of ley, carrying forward the extractive matters it has\r\ndissolved from the fibre with which it has been in contact) until\r\nexhausted or neutralized, (when they are discharged), fresh leys\r\nbeing methodically, and successively, supplied, until by degrees, the\r\nextractive matters combined with the fibre or fibrous material have\r\nbeen rendered sufficiently soluble, when hot water for washing, or\r\nrinsing, is in the same continuous manner run successively from vessel\r\nto vessel, over, and through, the material contained therein, until\r\nthe extractive matters rendered soluble by the previous alkaline baths\r\nhave been carried forward and discharged, leaving the residuary fibre\r\nsufficiently cleansed.\r\n\r\nBy this system of boiling in continuity, until all the effective\r\nalkali in the leys is exhausted or neutralized, I realize an economy\r\nof from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. of soda over the ordinary process\r\nof boiling, and by the subsequent washing, or rinsing, in the same\r\ncontinuous manner, without removing the material from the vessels, the\r\nnormal structure of the fibre is in a great measure retained, waste is\r\nminimized, and thus, while being thoroughly cleansed and freed from\r\nextraneous matter, the strength and staple of the fibre are preserved;\r\na considerable saving of fuel results from the heated liquors being\r\nused again and again, less steam being required, as also less water,\r\nwhile at the same time economy of both labour and power is effected\r\nover the ordinary system.\r\n\r\nAssuming the boiling and succeeding washing processes to be concluded,\r\nand the material (\"BAMBOO\") in one of the vessels of the series in its\r\nregular succession, to be found sufficiently treated and cleansed, a\r\nfinal cooling water is run on and through the fibre, which is then\r\ndrained, and the contents of the vessel (disconnected for the time\r\nbeing from the series) emptied into a waggon running on a railway,\r\nby which it is conducted to a press or otherwise to abstract all the\r\nremaining moisture possible.\r\n\r\nThe dry, or semi-dry fibre, is then submitted to the action of a\r\nwillow, or devil, by means of which it is opened or teazed out, and\r\nconverted readily into a tow-like condition, when it is dried by a\r\ncurrent of heated air, induced by a fan-blast, and finally baled up for\r\nstorage or transport, in a similar manner to COTTON or JUTE.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of \"_Paper-Stock_,\" it may be kept an indefinite\r\nlength of time without injury, and when received by the\r\nPaper-manufacturer requires merely soaking down and bleaching, to fit\r\nit for making into paper, either by itself, or used as a blend with\r\nother materials, as desired.\r\n\r\nThe minuter details of my process for treating raw fibres, or fibrous\r\nmaterial, for the manufacture therefrom of _Fibrous_ \"_Paper-Stock_,\"\r\nare fully described in my several Patents, the only variation so far\r\nas relates to \"Bamboo\" being the preliminary preparation of the young\r\nstems, the other portions of the process being substantially the same\r\nas in daily operation at the Ford Works, Sunderland, for the treatment\r\nof \"Esparto,\" and other \"_raw fibres_.\"\r\n\r\nI have only now further to remark that the \"Plant\" required to\r\nmanufacture \"_Paper-Stock_\" from \"Bamboo\" on an economical and\r\npractical working scale, would consist of a battery of boiling pans,\r\nwith the other necessary adjuncts and machinery, steam engines\r\nand steam boilers, such \"Plant\" being on a scale adequate to the\r\nmanufacture of 100 tons \"Bamboo\" weekly, producing therefrom say 60\r\ntons merchantable \"_Paper-Stock_.\"\r\n\r\nAs the above scale of operations, viz. the Manufacture of 100 tons\r\n(\"BAMBOO\") weekly into \"_Paper-Stock_,\" may appear somewhat large, it\r\nis necessary I should explain that owing to the nature of the Process,\r\nthe desired effect being produced by the reiterated and continuous\r\naction of repeated _weak_ Alkaline Baths or Leys, in a Series of\r\nVessels, such an operation involves the treatment of a large quantity\r\nof \"_Raw Material_,\" at one time, and cannot either conveniently or\r\neconomically be conducted upon a much smaller scale.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the \"Plant\" and Machinery required for such a Factory\r\nwould amount to about ***, packed ready for shipment in England, to\r\nwhich would have to be added the carriage and cost of erection, with\r\nthe necessary buildings, which, however, would be of a very simple and\r\ninexpensive character.\r\n\r\nI do not feel myself competent to determine what quantity of Land\r\nwould be required for a plantation to supply such a factory, which\r\nwould absorb 100 tons dry, say 400 tons green, \"Bamboo\" stems weekly,\r\nbut assuming 40 tons produce to the acre, with only once annual\r\ncropping, 500 acres should be ample. This calculation doubtless would\r\nbe influenced by the varying conditions of climate and soil, as also by\r\nthe variety of \"Bamboo\" cultivated.\r\n\r\nIt may be expected that I should in these \"REMARKS\" include some\r\nreference to the \"_Variety_\" of \"BAMBOO\" which could be most\r\neconomically and profitably cultivated for the supply of such a\r\nFactory, on the scale I propose.\r\n\r\nIn respect to this portion of my subject I experience some difficulty,\r\ninasmuch as the _Varieties_ of \"Bamboo\" are so numerous, and so widely\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nA Monograph by Colonel (now General) Munro, C.B., published in the\r\n'Transactions of the Linnean Society,' affords the most elaborate and\r\ncomprehensive description of the \"Bamboo:\" in this paper upwards of 170\r\nspecies are described.\r\n\r\nThe \"_Bambusa Vulgaris_,\" as its name indeed denotes, appears to be the\r\nmost generally distributed, as it is found in both Hemispheres, General\r\nMunro being in considerable doubt as to which it is a native of.\r\n\r\nI quote from his Monograph: \"I have seen it collected by Wallich, in\r\nSilhet, by Hooker, in Chittagong (both North-east India), from Ceylon\r\nwild, in the Mauritius cultivated abundantly, in the West Indies\r\nnaturalized, and cultivated in several parts of South America, this is\r\nthe only thoroughly cosmopolitan species.\"\r\n\r\nBambusa \"_Gigantea_,\" growing to the height of 120 feet and from\r\n25 to 30 inches circumference; B. \"_Edulis_,\" or edible Bamboo; B.\r\n\"_Arundinacea_;\" B. \"_Balcooa_;\" B. \"_Brandisii_,\" &c., all varying in\r\ngrowth to from 60 to 70, to 120 feet high, abound throughout India, and\r\nall our Asiatic Dependencies. In the West Indies also, where not now\r\nindigenous, doubtless any variety selected could readily be introduced\r\nand cultivated.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it would appear that with the \"_Raw Material_\" \"Bamboo,\"\r\nwe have under our control \"an embarrassment of riches,\" and I have only\r\nfurther to add that I know of no other that can at all approach it in\r\neconomy of production, and I believe very few if any in the quality of\r\nthe \"_Stock_\" produced therefrom suitable for Paper-making purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAMBOO,\r\n\r\nCONSIDERED AS A PAPER-MAKING MATERIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT POSITION OF THE PAPER TRADE IN RELATION TO THE SUPPLY OF\r\nRAW MATERIAL.\r\n\r\n\"The deficient supply of, and the increasing price for, the materials\r\nfor making paper and the prospect of a still greater consumption has\r\nfor some time excited the attention of manufacturers and the public.\"\r\n\r\nThe above REMARKS prefacing a MEMORANDUM drawn up by Dr. Forbes\r\nRoyle, reporting for \"THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE AFFAIRS OF INDIA,\"\r\nat the desire of \"THE LORDS OF HER MAJESTY'S TREASURY,\" and of \"THE\r\nLORDS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL FOR TRADE,\" in 1854, and\r\nsubsequently published in his valuable work, \"THE FIBROUS PLANTS OF\r\nINDIA,\" in 1855--twenty years ago--truly represent the position of the\r\nPaper-Trade at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe extension of education and literature, the necessity for cheap\r\nnewspapers and serial publications, the increased demand for paper for\r\nwriting, as also for manufacturing and commercial purposes generally,\r\nhave greatly stimulated consumption, and it is believed that since the\r\nabolition of the Excise duty in 1861, the annual production of paper\r\nhas more than doubled.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1861, raw fibrous material, with the exception perhaps of\r\nStraw, was but little used in paper-making, the waste of cotton, flax,\r\nhemp, and jute mills, having undergone a process of semi-manufacture,\r\nbeing comprised under the generic term of--Rags.\r\n\r\nThe American war, immediately following the repeal of the paper duty,\r\nthreatening a cotton famine, the Paper-makers gladly availed themselves\r\nof a new material, \"Esparto,\" which I had for some time previously been\r\nineffectually endeavouring to introduce, and adopting my process for\r\nits treatment, this material entered speedily into consumption, and\r\nhas tended more than anything else to promote the development of the\r\nPaper-trade by enabling the manufacturers to keep pace with the rapidly\r\nincreasing demand.\r\n\r\nThe importations of \"ESPARTO,\" which did not amount to 1000 tons in\r\nthe year 1860 (indeed up to that date I was the only manufacturer\r\nusing it[A]), rose to upwards of 50,000 tons in the year 1865, and by\r\n1871--ten years only from its introduction--the annual imports had\r\nattained the large total of 140,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\"ESPARTO\" being a wild grass (or, botanically speaking, a sedge)\r\ngrowing on waste lands, in Spain and Africa, owing to the greed of\r\nthe native collectors--who, while gathering the plant, pluck it up\r\nrecklessly, roots and all--is being gradually but surely exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe complete exhaustion of the plant is proceeding very rapidly in\r\nSpain; and as it is estimated by the best informed authorities that it\r\nwill take, even with the greatest care and under the most favourable\r\nconditions, at least fifteen years to reproduce it from seed (a system\r\nnot very likely to be pursued in that country,) at no very remote\r\nperiod this valuable paper-making material appears doomed to extinction.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years a large and increasing supply of \"ESPARTO,\"\r\nor as it is there called \"_Alfa_,\" has been received from Africa;\r\nand although the quality of African Esparto is not valued by the\r\npaper-trade as high as the Spanish, still it meets with a ready sale,\r\nbeing used to mix with, or in substitution of the latter.\r\n\r\nAs much as 60,000 tons were imported last year (1874) from Algeria,\r\nand great inducements by concessions and otherwise, are offered by the\r\nFrench Government to induce railway communication with the interior\r\ndistricts of that country, where the plant is said to abound on some of\r\nthe mountainous plateaux, and thus for some little time the market may\r\nbe supplied, but the difficulty of procuring labour, and the cost of\r\nrailway carriage for such long distances, will add considerably to the\r\npresent charges of transit to this country.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two or three years, the Belgian and American\r\nPaper-makers have commenced using \"Esparto,\" and so latterly have the\r\nFrench, and as our main sources of supply will now be Algeria, (a\r\nFrench colony,) any material reduction in prices can hardly be looked\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\"ESPARTO,\" like other commercial products, is amenable to the law\r\nof supply and demand; and thus, as the demand is, and is likely to\r\ncontinue in excess of the supply, its cost has enormously increased,\r\nthe price it now commands in the market being nearly double that,\r\nat which I sold many thousand tons during the early years of its\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nThe Paper-manufacturers are thus again experiencing the same difficulty\r\nrecognized by THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY, and by THE BOARD OF TRADE in\r\n1854, and which more recently was considered of sufficient importance\r\nto induce the appointment of a SELECT COMMITTEE ordered by THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS in 1861:\r\n\r\n\"To inquire into the DUTIES OR PROHIBITIONS in FOREIGN COUNTRIES on the\r\nEXPORT OF RAGS used in the MANUFACTURE OF PAPER in the UNITED KINGDOM,\r\nand their effect upon that MANUFACTURE.\"\r\n\r\nThe COMMITTEE REPORTED: \"That the production of paper in this country\r\nis in excess of the supply of the material of which it is made, and\r\nthe paper manufacture is in consequence dependent for a large portion\r\nof its supplies on foreign Rags, amounting to about 15,000 tons per\r\nannum, which is by estimation a fifth of the whole quantity of Rags\r\nused for the manufacture of white paper in this country, on nearly the\r\nwhole of which heavy export duties are paid.\"\r\n\r\nAnother paragraph of the COMMITTEE'S \"REPORT\" states: \"That the\r\nCommittee have directed their especial attention to inquiring as to the\r\npossibility of applying any _New Fibre_ as a substitute for the refuse\r\nmaterial now in use for Paper-making purposes, and find that great\r\nefforts have been made to discover some material of this nature, but as\r\nyet with little success; and although they see no reason to doubt that\r\nStraw and other fibrous substances may form a supplementary part of the\r\nmaterial for paper-making, the great comparative expense of chemically\r\nreducing these _Raw Fibres_ presents difficulties to their becoming a\r\nsubstitute for the refuse material now used.\"\r\n\r\nSince the above \"REPORT\" was published, the position of the Trade has\r\nmaterially altered. The export duties in some countries have been\r\nabolished, in others reduced; Rag material has increased in quantity\r\nand diminished in price; \"the difficulties of chemically reducing _Raw\r\nFibres_\" no longer exist; and the \"15,000 _tons_ of Rags\" estimated\r\nby the \"COMMITTEE\" as the requirements of the Trade have been more\r\nthan \"substituted\" by the 150,000 _tons of_ \"ESPARTO\" _and other Raw\r\nmaterial_, now annually imported, while the development of the chemical\r\ntrade keeping pace with the introduction of \"RAW FIBRES\" has materially\r\nfacilitated their employment.\r\n\r\nCaustic soda, but little known in 1861, is now extensively\r\nmanufactured, and Weldon's new process has greatly increased the power\r\nof production and diminished the cost of manufacturing bleaching\r\npowder; thus \"the comparative expense of chemically reducing _Raw\r\nFibres_\" is no longer an obstacle to progress.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of the present day will, in fact, undertake to make\r\npaper from any raw fibre, or fibrous substance that may be submitted to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe has, however, several questions to consider before he will commit\r\nhimself to purchase or contract for any new fibrous material, these\r\nbeing: its cost, not merely as a raw material, but in the details\r\nof manufacture, and the quality of the paper that can economically\r\nbe made from such fibre, either alone, or introducing it as a blend\r\nwith the material he at present employs; then, assuming these points\r\nsatisfactorily determined, he would desire to know the quantity of such\r\nmaterial annually available, with some guarantee for continuous and\r\nreliable supply at a price not liable to erratic fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe value of \"ESPARTO\" as a Paper-making material having been\r\nrecognized, and its employment almost universally adopted in the Trade,\r\nnaturally led to various attempts to introduce other \"_new material_,\"\r\nwhich hitherto, however, have met with only partial success: the\r\n\"DWARF PALM,\" _Chamoerops humilis_, and \"DISS,\" as well as some\r\nother materials from North Africa, have been tried and abandoned as\r\nunsuitable: \"JUTE\" also has latterly attracted considerable attention;\r\n\"Butts\" or \"Cuttings,\" as they are termed, the refuse from the\r\npreparation of the long clean fibre now so largely used as a Textile,\r\nhave entered extensively into consumption, being imported from India\r\nspecially for paper-makers' use, packed in hydraulic-pressed bales;\r\nbut this fibre is difficult and costly to bleach perfectly, and is\r\nonly employed for the lower class of \"News\" and \"Common printing,\" or\r\nunbleached, for \"Brown\" and \"Wrapping\" papers; but as it has long been\r\nfamiliar to the trade in the form of Waste, Gunny-bagging, and Rope, it\r\ncan hardly be termed a \"_New Material_.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three other excellent fibrous materials may be mentioned, small\r\nparcels of which are occasionally to be met with, that are, or more\r\ncorrectly speaking would be, much prized by Paper-manufacturers if\r\nobtainable at reasonable rates, such as \"ADANSONIA BARK,\" \"NEW ZEALAND\r\nFLAX,\" \"MANILLA HEMP,\" \"SUNN,\" and other INDIAN, HEMP-LIKE FIBRES,\r\nall of which will bleach well and make paper of superior quality; but\r\nunfortunately the quantity available is so small, and the supply so\r\nirregular and uncertain, that they can hardly be relied upon as \"_Raw\r\nMaterial_.\"\r\n\r\n\"WOOD,\" both chemically and mechanically prepared, has been, and indeed\r\nis now, used to a very considerable extent; but the latter, produced\r\nby grinding down \"billets\" from the tree as cut down, on a grindstone\r\nto a pulp, with water, or without water, to the condition of flour,\r\ncontains but little fibre, and that fibre with very little \"felting\"\r\nproperty (an essential for a good sheet of paper); thus it can only be\r\nused as a \"filler-up\" for \"cheap News\" and common papers, like \"clay\"\r\n(facetiously called in the trade Devonshire linen), or any other adulterant\r\nwhich the necessities of the Paper-maker, to meet the market, (_or in other\r\nwords deficient supply of good and cheap suitable material_) compel\r\nhim to use.\r\n\r\n\"WOOD,\" chemically prepared, is costly in production, as it is only\r\npossible to reduce it into _Pulp_, by boiling under very high pressure,\r\nwith strong caustic alkali; several mills established both in England\r\nand Scotland, to carry out this manufacture, have abandoned it, and\r\nsuch _Pulp_ as is now used in the Trade is derived exclusively from the\r\ncountries where the wood is grown. The _Pulp_ thus produced, although\r\nsomewhat hard and harsh, if the wood is carefully selected, and\r\nproperly prepared, will, blended with other material, produce a fair\r\nquality of paper.\r\n\r\nThe use of \"STRAW,\" from the \"_Cereals_,\" WHEAT, OATS, and RYE, has\r\nof late years greatly extended, both in this country and throughout\r\nthe continent of Europe, as well as in the United States of America,\r\neither alone or as an admixture with rags and other material, for\r\nall classes of paper, as these countries equally with England suffer\r\nfrom a deficient supply of _Raw Material_; but in England, owing to\r\nthe increased consumption for agricultural and feeding purposes, and\r\ninfluenced also by the scarcity and high prices lately ruling for\r\n\"ESPARTO\" in many districts, \"STRAW\" has become very difficult to\r\nobtain, and considerable quantities have in consequence been imported\r\nfrom Holland and Belgium, both raw, and as bleached _Pulp_.\r\n\r\nI may here mention two other fibrous substances, which have from time\r\nto time attracted considerable attention, viz. \"MAIZE LEAVES\" and \"RICE\r\nSTRAW,\" both of them _raw materials_, from which a fair quality of\r\npaper is produced in the countries where these plants are cultivated;\r\nbut, as in their natural condition after being harvested they are far\r\ntoo bulky to permit of transport to this country, they would have to be\r\nreduced to a portable form where they grow, and even then, owing to the\r\nsmall yield of \"_true fibre_,\" their economical conversion is somewhat\r\ndoubtful, unless under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe daily increasing demand for PAPER being recognized, and the\r\nimpending if not immediate scarcity of _Raw Material_ available for its\r\nmanufacture, up to the present time, having been shown, to what quarter\r\nmust the Trade look for an extended supply?\r\n\r\nThis it must be admitted has become an important question for\r\nconsideration, it being evident that unless some \"_New Material_\"\r\nsuitable for the purpose is speedily introduced, the \"PAPER TRADE,\"\r\none of the most important in the UNITED KINGDOM, will be seriously\r\ncrippled; meanwhile of necessity high prices are maintained, and as a\r\nnatural consequence the consumer suffers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBRE-PRODUCING PLANTS--SOURCES OF SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nThe high value of land precludes the cultivation of any fibrous\r\nmaterial exclusively for paper-making in England, even if this climate\r\nwas suitable for its growth; with the exception indeed of \"FLAX\" and\r\n\"HEMP,\" it would appear that northern latitudes are not favourable for\r\nthe production of fibre-producing plants, and therefore it is to warm\r\nor _tropical countries_ alone any reliable supply of \"NEW MATERIAL\" can\r\nbe looked for.\r\n\r\nIn the _East_, and _West Indies_, in her _Colonies_ and _Dependencies_,\r\nEngland possesses an inexhaustible supply of fibre-producing plants; in\r\nIndia especially, almost every plant abounds more or less in fibre.\r\n\r\nIn China and Japan, as also in India, from the earliest times, paper\r\nhas been made exclusively from _raw indigenous virgin fibres_, and the\r\npaper produced in these countries is in consequence generally extremely\r\nstrong and tough, and although unbleached, and not made in a fashion\r\nadapted to European requirements, affords ample and conclusive evidence\r\nof the valuable supply of material at our disposal.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE FIBROUS, or FIBRE-PRODUCING PLANTS, are divided by BOTANISTS\r\ninto two distinct CLASSES or DIVISIONS: ENDOGENS, or inside growers;\r\nEXOGENS, or outside growers.\r\n\r\nFrom the former are obtained the fibres known as \"MANILLA HEMP\" or\r\n\"ABACA\" (from the _Musa textilis_ or _Plantain_), the \"ALOE,\" \"AGAVÉ\"\r\n(or \"_Pita_ _Fibre_\"), the \"YUCCA,\" \"BROMELIA PENGUIN,\" \"SISAL HEMP\"\r\n(or _Hannequin_); \"PINA FIBRE\" from the \"PINE APPLE\" (_Ananassa\r\nsativa_), \"MAROOL or MOORVA\" (_Sanseveira Zeylanica_), \"NEW ZEALAND\r\nFLAX\" (_Phormium tenax_), &c.; \"MAIZE\" (or _Indian Corn_), \"RICE,\"\r\nand other \"CEREAL STRAWS,\" \"ESPARTO,\" \"DISS,\" and various \"Sedges,\"\r\n\"Reeds,\" and \"Grasses,\" the latter including \"BAMBOO,\" and \"SUGAR\r\nCANE,\" are also comprised in this Class.\r\n\r\nThe FIBRES, or FIBROUS TISSUE enveloping the _Stems_ of _Herbaceous\r\nPlants_, known as \"HEMP,\" \"FLAX,\" \"JUTE,\" \"HIBISCUS,\" (_Gombo_ or\r\n_Okhro_), \"RHEA,\" or \"CHINA-GRASS\" (_Urtica nivea_), \"SUNN HEMP\"\r\n(_Cratolaria juncea_), &c., as also the LACE BARKS (so called), such\r\nas the \"ADANSONIA DIGITATAS\" (from the _Baobab_ tree), the \"NEPAL\r\nPAPER PLANT\" (_Daphne cannabina_), the \"PAPER MULBERRY\" (_Broussonetia\r\npapyrifera_), &c., constitute the latter Class.\r\n\r\nI have confined myself to recapitulating _a few only_ of the _fibres_\r\nin either class, best known to commerce; this list, indeed, might be\r\nextended almost indefinitely, as may be seen by reference to the work\r\nbefore alluded to, 'The Fibrous Plants of India,' by Dr. Forbes Royle,\r\nas also to the elaborate Paper on the same subject, read at the meeting\r\nof the Society of Arts, May 9, 1860, by Dr. J. Forbes Watson, Reporter\r\non the Products of India, Dr. Royle's able successor.\r\n\r\nWith some few exceptions (notably \"Esparto\" and some of the Cereal\r\nstraws and grasses), the resulting or ultimate fibres from vegetable\r\nfibrous plants, before they can be utilized either for Textile\r\npurposes, or for the manufacture of Paper, must be freed from the\r\nextraneous substances with which during their growth they are more or\r\nless combined.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Endogens_, the fibres are imbedded or enveloped in\r\nsucculent, fleshy, or pulpy stems, or leaves; and in the case of\r\n_Exogens_, the fibre is combined with, and attaching to, wood, or woody\r\nmatter, such extraneous substances or matters constituting, more or\r\nless, a considerable portion both of the weight and bulk of the plant\r\neven when matured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF FIBRE-PRODUCING PLANTS.\r\n\r\nFrom all, or nearly all, _Endogenous_ plants the fibres are extracted\r\nby hand labour, no machinery having been hitherto invented by which\r\nthis operation can be performed in an economical and satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy stems, or leaves, of this class of plants are crushed and\r\nbeaten, macerated in water, scraped and roughly combed, to separate the\r\nfibrous from the vascular, or pulpy portion of the plant; sometimes\r\nthe plants are buried in wet sand, or mud, leaving them to soak, or\r\nrot, for many days, then beaten on a stone, scraped, and combed; but by\r\nthis system the fibres generally lose colour and strength. The yield of\r\nfibre from this class of _Endogens_ ranges from 6 to 12 per cent., and\r\nit is only where native labour is exceedingly cheap and abundant that\r\nsuch a laborious and tedious process could be carried on.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the fibres from _Exogenous_ plants are also, in\r\nsomewhat a similar manner obtained solely by manual labour; the\r\nherbaceous, or woody stems of such plants, being first steeped, or\r\nretted, to induce partial fermentation, and facilitate the separation\r\nof the corticular fibres, from the woody stem.\r\n\r\nWhen produced in Europe, Flax and Hemp form an exception, being\r\ngenerally dried before steeping, which process is also more\r\nsystematically and regularly conducted, and the subsequent separation\r\nof the ultimate fibres effected by breaking, scutching, and heckling;\r\nthese operations being as far as possible carried out mechanically.\r\n\r\nWhen the cost of cultivation, of carriage, freight to this country,\r\ncharges and merchants' profit, are added to the outlay involved\r\nin producing clean fibres by the laborious and tedious processes\r\ndescribed, even with the exceedingly cheap labour of _tropical\r\ncountries_, it will readily be understood that they cannot be sold at a\r\ncheap rate.\r\n\r\nWhen the above outlay has been incurred, and clean merchantable fibre\r\nresults, such fibre will generally secure a high price in the market\r\nfor Spinning, Roping, and other Textile purposes, far beyond the\r\nPaper-maker's limits, who therefore can only avail himself of damaged\r\nparcels, or such as, being of low or inferior quality, have been\r\nrejected by the \"Spinner,\" and, even then, has to come into competition\r\nwith the maker of low-class goods, the common \"sacking and mat-maker,\"\r\nas any fibre of fair strength, long enough to spin into a coarse yarn,\r\ncommands good value in the market.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from the preceding remarks that the\r\nPaper-manufacturer, for an extended supply of _Material_, must look\r\nto a _fibre_ or fibrous substance which, either like \"Esparto,\" can\r\nbe utilized direct, without having to pass through this process of\r\nsemi-manufacture, or to some other \"_New Material_,\" which, from the\r\npeculiarity either of its production or growth, and to the simplicity\r\nand economy of its treatment, can be imported into this country, in a\r\ncondition suitable for his requirements.\r\n\r\nKnowing from personal observation the peculiarities of the growth,\r\nproduction, and collection of the \"ESPARTO\" plant, and believing\r\nthe time would come when the supply would be unequal to the demand\r\n(although I must admit, owing to the rapid extension of the\r\nPaper-trade, that time has arrived sooner than I anticipated), I\r\nhave long and continuously kept my attention directed to any \"_New\r\nMaterial_\" which appeared likely to become available for Paper-making\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFor many years past, I have devoted much time to the investigation of\r\n_Fibres_, during which period I have, I believe, tested both chemically\r\nand practically as a Paper-maker, nearly every _fibrous material_\r\nintroduced into the market, with, as may naturally be supposed,\r\nextremely variable results.\r\n\r\nBefore any \"_New Material_\" will be favourably received by the\r\nPaper-manufacturer, it is clear that certain conditions must be\r\nfulfilled; these being that such \"_Material_\" shall favourably compare,\r\nso far as regards quality and cost, with those he now employs,\r\nand that he shall feel satisfied he may rely upon a continuity of\r\nsupply, not subject to violent fluctuations in price.\r\n\r\nOnce assured on these points, there can be no doubt that, especially\r\nunder existing circumstances (viz. deficient supply and high prices),\r\nthe Paper-trade would gladly welcome the advent of any \"_New Material_\"\r\ncalculated to relieve the present, or apprehended scarcity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Paper-trade, and its supply of materials in the\r\nfuture, two _raw fibrous substances_ exist, to which I now desire\r\nto direct special attention, as I believe it would be difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to meet with any others to compare with them in the\r\nessential points, of reliable supply at extremely low cost combined\r\nwith quality.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction I have devoted much attention to perfecting a\r\nsimple and economical system of treating them, in order to produce a\r\nfibrous \"_Paper-Stock_,\" considering _that_ to be the most practicable\r\nand best form in which they can be introduced into the Market.\r\n\r\nOne of these materials, \"MEGASSE,\" or \"BEGASSE,\" fulfils the main\r\nconditions which would be looked for by the Paper-manufacturer,\r\ninasmuch as vast quantities are available at a low cost, and owing to\r\nthe peculiarity of its production being the necessary by-product of\r\na large and widely spread staple industry--Sugar--not subject to the\r\nordinary irregularity of supply.\r\n\r\n\"MEGASSE,\" the fibrous residue of the Sugar-Cane (after it has been\r\ncrushed to extract the juice), properly prepared, affords a strong,\r\nnervous fibre, or \"_Fibrous Stock_,\" which bleaches well, and possesses\r\nall the characteristics of a first-class Paper-making material.\r\n\r\n\"MEGASSE\" however, as it comes from the crushing rolls, and even when\r\ndried after crushing, is so exceedingly bulky, that (being produced\r\nalmost exclusively in tropical countries) the cost of carriage added\r\nto its great liability to damage from fermentation, precludes the\r\npossibility of its being imported to England in its crude state;\r\nmoreover, the true fibrous portion of \"Megasse\" does not amount to\r\nmore than 40 per cent., the remainder being constituted of CELLULOSE,\r\ncombined with glutenous and other compounds, which of themselves are\r\nuseless for Paper-making, and which consequently must be separated from\r\nthe residuary or ultimate fibre.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that \"MEGASSE\" must be converted into a _Fibrous\r\nStock_ at, or near, the Sugar factory where it is produced, then dried,\r\nand put up in hydraulic-pressed bales for economical transport.\r\n\r\nThe present value of \"MEGASSE\" (in its crude condition as produced)\r\nis relatively to that of fuel, as, unless it is returned to the soil\r\nas manure (which is the practice in some countries), it is employed\r\nin the Sugar factories, for raising steam, for motive power, and for\r\nevaporating the Cane juice.\r\n\r\nAs the value of \"Megasse\" thus considered is very low, factories\r\nestablished in connection with existing sugar mills for the manufacture\r\nof \"_Paper-Stock_,\" where sufficient quantities of so bulky a material\r\ncould be concentrated, and where other favourable conditions exist (of\r\nwhich an abundant supply of water is an essential), would yield a large\r\nprofit to the planter or sugar manufacturer, as the \"_Paper-Stock_\"\r\nhe would produce would meet with a ready sale at prices at least\r\nequivalent to \"ESPARTO,\" reduced to the same condition.\r\n\r\nHaving made \"_Paper-Stock_,\" and \"_Paper_\" of good quality from\r\n\"MEGASSE,\" and determined the profitable result of such a manufacture\r\nbeyond dispute, I look forward at no very distant date to see the\r\nPaper-trade of this country receiving, at least, a portion of its\r\n_raw material_ from some of our own _Colonies_ and _Dependencies_ (in\r\nmost of which Sugar is produced), instead of, as now, being entirely\r\ndependent on Foreign Countries for supply.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the consumption of sugar in England amounts\r\nannually to upwards of 800,000 tons, or about 57 lb. per head of the\r\npopulation; and as it may be assumed that for each ton of sugar 1 ton\r\nof \"Megasse\" at least is produced, it will be seen that a large reserve\r\nof _Fibrous Material_ is available, awaiting the enterprise of either\r\nthe Sugar or the Paper-manufacturer or a combination of both.\r\n\r\nIt is now my object to show to the _Two parties_ mainly interested, the\r\nPRODUCER and the CONSUMER, how closely their interests are coincident,\r\nand how both would be benefited by the creation and development of a\r\nnew INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nThe PRODUCER, the Sugar-manufacturer, is, in point of fact\r\nsuffering from a similar competition to that experienced by the\r\nPaper-manufacturer in 1861--handicapped by the _drawback_ allowed on\r\nthe export of FRENCH, AND BELGIAN, BEET-ROOT SUGAR, with which he is\r\nunable to compete, in the same manner as the Paper-maker suffered from\r\nthe introduction of FRENCH, AND BELGIAN, PAPER--_free_, while the RAW\r\nMATERIAL--RAGS, paid a heavy _export duty_.\r\n\r\nThe CONSUMER, the Paper-manufacturer, is suffering from a lack of\r\nsuitable material, which the Producer is able to supply, and by so\r\nsupplying and utilizing a by-product, hitherto of little value to him,\r\nplaces himself in a position to meet his competitors on equal, if not\r\nbetter terms in the market.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that this (to him) new system of utilizing what may now be\r\ntermed a waste, or by-product, would involve the outlay of additional\r\ncapital, by the Sugar-planter or manufacturer, which he may deem\r\nforeign to his present business, but manufacturers now-a-days make\r\ntheir profits mainly by utilizing by-products.\r\n\r\nA familiar instance of this may be cited in the Chemical trade; the\r\nmuriatic acid produced in the manufacture of soda, formerly run to\r\nwaste, being now employed for making bleaching powder; and, still more\r\nrecently, the by-products annaline, anthracene, ammonia, &c., which\r\nformerly created a nuisance wherever Gas-Works existed, now constitute\r\na large portion of their profits.\r\n\r\n\"BAMBOO,\" the other _Raw Material_ to which I have alluded, can hardly\r\nbe called \"_New_,\" it being well known that both the Chinese and\r\nJapanese have from time immemorial employed \"Bamboo\" for Paper-making\r\npurposes; and I have shown in the preceding \"Remarks\" that attempts\r\nhave more recently been made, not hitherto affording successful\r\ncommercial results.\r\n\r\nIt therefore would have been more correct had I, in directing\r\nattention to \"BAMBOO,\" described it as an \"_Old material_\" under\r\n\"_New treatment_.\" Such indeed was the case with \"ESPARTO,\" an \"_Old\r\nmaterial_,\" well known, and tried ineffectually by many, previous to\r\nmy process for converting it into paper being adopted, which, however,\r\ndid not take place until it had been fully tested and approved, leading\r\nthen to its speedy employment.\r\n\r\nI believe with my new system of treatment \"BAMBOO\" will prove to be as\r\nsuperior to \"Esparto,\" in every respect as \"Esparto\" was found to be\r\nsuperior to \"Straw,\" the only other \"_raw material_\" used when it was\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\"BAMBOO\" differs from \"MEGASSE,\" inasmuch as the latter is produced, as\r\nit were, involuntarily, its maximum value as a \"_raw product_\" being\r\ndetermined by its comparison with fuel; whereas \"BAMBOO\" would have to\r\nbe cultivated; but, as this plant will not only grow, but flourish, in\r\nlocalities unsuitable for other cultivation, and is produced with such\r\nextraordinary rapidity and abundance, it would appear that, as a _Raw\r\nProduct_, it would not cost much, if any, more than \"MEGASSE.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly my province to discuss here to which of the two materials,\r\n\"MEGASSE\" or \"BAMBOO,\" the preference should be given. Suffice it to\r\nsay that, with \"_the admitted fact_\" of the increasing scarcity of _Raw\r\nMaterial_ for Paper-making, there is ample scope for both. I have only\r\nto add that I shall be happy to advise with parties who may desire to\r\ninterest themselves in either question.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAs I have broadly stated that \"_Paper-Stock_\" can be produced from both\r\n\"BAMBOO\" and \"MEGASSE,\" to show a good _Profit_, it may be well to\r\nmention the present cost of \"ESPARTO\" reduced to the same condition (of\r\n\"_Paper-Stock_\"), as it is with this _Material_ these _Fibres_ would\r\nmainly have to compete, seeing that with its large consumption and\r\nwidely extended use for most classes of Paper it now rules the Market.\r\n\r\nThe cost of good _Spanish_ \"ESPARTO\" at current rates, is, delivered\r\ninto a Mill (say), 10_l._ per ton; it is generally assumed in the\r\nPaper-trade that about 2 tons of \"Esparto\" are required to make 1 ton\r\npaper, the yield being from 48 to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nAt 50 per cent. yield therefore we have 20_l._ per ton for \"_Raw\r\nMaterial_.\" Add to this, for chemicals, boiling, fuel, and labour,\r\n50_s._ × 2 tons, we arrive at 25_l._ for the cost of \"Esparto\" in the\r\nsame condition of _unbleached_ \"_Stock_,\" sufficient for 1 ton paper.\r\n\r\n\"ALFA\" or \"_African_\" Esparto does not afford so good a yield, neither\r\nwill it bleach to so high a colour, nor make so good a quality of paper\r\nas \"_Spanish_\"; its value therefore is proportionately lower in the\r\nMarket, say 8_l._ per ton as compared with 10_l._: the cost therefore\r\nof \"Alfa\" reduced to a similar condition of \"_Stock_\" may be taken at\r\n21_l._\r\n\r\n\"ALFA\" (if carefully selected) so closely resembles \"_Spanish_\"\r\n\"ESPARTO,\" in its _raw condition_, that it is very difficult to\r\ndistinguish one from the other, and when the two are skilfully blended,\r\nit is impossible to do so, until the bleaching process of manufacture\r\nis reached; thus, it has happened, that during the past two or three\r\nyears many thousands of tons of \"ALFA,\" having taken a \"tour\" through\r\n\"_Spain_,\" and being there naturalized, have found their way to England\r\nand been sold to the unsophisticated English Paper-maker as \"_Spanish_\"\r\n\"ESPARTO,\" thus supplementing the rapid exhaustion of the indigenous\r\ngrass of that country.\r\n\r\n\"WOOD\" \"_Pulp_\" as I have mentioned, is imported, both mechanically\r\nand chemically prepared, the latter (unbleached) finding a ready sale,\r\nat 24_l._ to 25_l._ per ton; \"STRAW\" \"_Pulp_\" also (bleached) realizes\r\n26_l._ to 27_l._ per ton, but neither of these materials are likely to\r\nbe introduced to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\n\"_Paper-Stock_,\" resulting from either \"BAMBOO\" or \"MEGASSE,\" will show\r\na very large margin of profit from the figures I have quoted, thus\r\nallowing for any necessary reduction should prices fall from increased\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nIn concluding my \"_Remarks_,\" having in the preceding Pages suggested\r\nthe conversion of \"_Raw Fibrous Substances_,\" notably, \"BAMBOO\" and\r\n\"MEGASSE,\" into Fibrous \"_Paper-Stock_,\" I ought perhaps distinctly\r\nto explain the difference between \"_Half-Stuff_,\" or \"_Pulp_,\" and\r\n\"_Paper-Stock_,\" and my reasons for expressing a preference for the\r\nlatter form of preparation,--a preference warranted, I believe, both by\r\npractical, and economical considerations.\r\n\r\nWhatever \"_Material_\" the Paper-maker employs, be it Rags (of any\r\ndenomination) or any other \"_Fibre_,\" or \"_Fibrous_,\" substance, after\r\nBoiling, he disintegrates, or comminutes it into \"_Half-Stuff_,\"\r\nbefore, or while bleaching. This process, carried a stage farther,\r\nconverts the \"_Half-Stuff_\" into \"_Pulp_.\" Herein, not less than in\r\nthe proper selection of his \"_Raw Material_,\" lies the skill of the\r\nPaper-maker, as, however good his \"_Material_\" may be, in its _Raw_\r\nor normal condition, it may be very easily spoilt in either of the\r\nprocesses of Boiling,--Bleaching,--or Pulping.\r\n\r\nFor example, when Bread is once toasted, thereby becoming brown (and\r\nthe purer and whiter the greater the change), whereby its chemical and\r\nmechanical character has become altered, no power can reconvert it into\r\nits original condition; in like manner, however good a \"_Raw Fibrous\r\nMaterial_\" may be, if that \"_Material_\" be either over-boiled, or\r\nover-pulped, no power will restore its normal character.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a \"_Fibrous_\" substance once reduced to the condition of\r\n\"_Pulp_,\" it is difficult, if not impossible, even for a Microscopist,\r\nto distinguish accurately the character or quality of the original\r\n\"_Fibre_,\"--its strength,--or whether it has been properly or\r\nimproperly treated, and reduced to that condition--until, perhaps\r\ntoo late, when he has bleached it, and converted it, or attempted to\r\nconvert it, into a sheet of Paper.\r\n\r\nWith a Fibrous \"_Paper-Stock_,\" however, these objections do not apply,\r\nor certainly not to the same degree, as the Paper-maker could readily\r\nexamine and judge of the character and strength of the \"_Fibre_\"\r\nwhether it was clean and free from imperfections or adulterations--in\r\nfact, could see what he was buying, or proposing to buy, which he could\r\nnot do with \"_Half-Stuff_\" or \"_Pulp_.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the Producer is concerned, his outlay for the primary \"Plant\"\r\nand the mechanical appliances, the cost of the subsequent treatment,\r\nthe drying, packing, and economical carriage and freight from a Foreign\r\ncountry, would in all respects be less for \"_Paper-Stock_\" than for\r\n\"_Half-Stuff_\" or \"_Pulp_.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking from the experience of some years, during which I have\r\nconducted the manufacture and sale of many thousand tons of\r\n\"_Half-Stuff_\" prepared from \"ESPARTO\" and other \"_Raw Fibres_,\" I\r\nfeel satisfied that in introducing a _New Semi-prepared Material_,\r\nfrom a Foreign country, the preference would be given by the practical\r\nPaper-maker to a \"_Fibrous Paper-Stock_.\"\r\n\r\n                                         THOMAS ROUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n  CLAXHEUGH, SUNDERLAND,\r\n          1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] The Journal of the Society of Arts, 28th Nov., 1856, was printed\r\non paper made from Esparto, at Eynsham Mills, near Oxford, then in my\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _underscore_.\r\n\r\nFractions are displayed as follows: 1/2 correlates with 1 half, 1-1/2\r\ncorrelates with 1 and a half....\r\n\r\nOn page 15 some text is missing it is marked as ***.\r\n\r\nOther than the corrections listed below, printer's inconsistencies\r\nin spelling, punctuation, hyphenation, and ligature usage have been\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n\r\n  changed \"with \"HEMP' and \"FLAX,\" where\"\r\n     into \"with \"HEMP\" and \"FLAX,\" where\"\r\n    (page 8)\r\n\r\n  changed \"the \"15,000 _tons_ of Rags estimated by\"\r\n     into \"the \"15,000 _tons_ of Rags\" estimated by\"\r\n    (page 22)",
