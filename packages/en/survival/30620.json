FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of examining material from fissure deposits of early\r\nPermian age collected from a limestone quarry near Fort Sill, Oklahoma,\r\nthe author recovered several tooth-bearing fragments of small\r\npelycosaurs. The fragments were examined, compared with descriptions of\r\nknown kinds appearing in the literature, and determined to be new genera\r\nwithin the Nitosauridae (Edaphosauria) and Sphenacodontidae\r\n(Sphenacodontia).\r\n\r\nAppreciation is expressed to Prof. Theodore H. Eaton, Jr., for\r\npermission to examine the collections of the University of Kansas from\r\nFort Sill, and for the financial assistance furnished by his National\r\nScience Foundation grant (NSF-G8624). I am grateful both to Prof. Eaton\r\nand Mr. Dale L. Hoyt for their suggestions regarding this manuscript.\r\nThe accompanying figures have been drawn by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily NITOSAURIDAE\r\n\r\n=Delorhynchus priscus= new genus and new species\r\n\r\n\r\n(_delos_, Gr., evident; _rhynchos_, Gr., neuter, nostril; _priscus_, L.,\r\nancient. _Delorhynchus_ is masculine because of the ending that it\r\nacquires when transliterated into Latin.)\r\n\r\n_Type specimen._--Fragmentary left maxilla, bearing four teeth, KU\r\n11117.\r\n\r\n_Referred specimens._--Fragmentary right maxilla having four teeth, KU\r\n11118; fragmentary left maxilla having four teeth, the most posterior of\r\nwhich has been broken, KU 11119.\r\n\r\n_Horizon and locality._--A fissure deposit in the Arbuckle limestone at\r\nthe Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, approximately six miles north of\r\nFort Sill, in sec. 31, T. 4 N, R. 11 W, Comanche County, Oklahoma. These\r\nsediments are of early Permian age, possibly equivalent to the Arroyo\r\nformation, Lower Clear Fork Group of Texas (Vaughn, 1958: 981).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Small; marginal teeth conical, slender and recurved at\r\ntips; marginal tooth-row without caniniform enlargement; narial opening\r\nenlarged and bordered dorsally, posteriorly and ventrally by maxilla;\r\nmaxilla with foramen opening laterally at posteroventral corner of\r\nnaris.\r\n\r\n_Description_ (based on 3 maxillary fragments, see Table 1).--Each of\r\nthe maxillary fragments bears four thecodont teeth. These are conical,\r\nslender and sharply pointed; in their distal third they are slightly\r\nrecurved, laterally compressed, and have anterior and posterior\r\nnon-serrated cutting edges. In medial aspect at their bases, the teeth\r\nare longitudinally striated. The bases of the teeth are circular in\r\ncross-section and are slightly bulbous. There is no caniniform\r\nenlargement of any of the teeth, the longest tooth of each fragment\r\nbeing differently placed in the series of teeth and little longer than\r\nthe others. There is no swelling on either the internal or external\r\nsurfaces of the maxillae. The teeth are in a continuous series; no\r\ndiastema or maxillary step is evident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURES 1-3. _Delorhynchus priscus_, lower Permian, 6\r\nmiles north of Fort Sill, Comanche County, Oklahoma.

KU 11119, lateral view of left maxilla.]\r\n\r\nThe fragments have been broken along similar lines of fracture, and each\r\nis approximately rhomboidal in shape. The maxilla encircles the\r\nposterior border of the naris and extends dorsally above the naris to an\r\nextent sufficient to indicate the probable exclusion of the lacrimal\r\nbone from the narial border. At the posteroventral corner of the naris a\r\nforamen opens onto the lateral surface of the maxilla. The opening is\r\nthe entrance to a canal that runs posteriorly above the tooth-row\r\nthroughout the length of each specimen. Beneath the naris the maxilla\r\nextends as a broad tapering shelf, the ventral surface of which\r\narticulates with the premaxilla. The narial rim is wide, but wider\r\nventrally than dorsally. The plane of the narial rim is oblique to the\r\nlateral surface of the maxilla. The external surface of each fragment is\r\ngrooved and pitted. The ossification of each fragment appears to have\r\nbeen complete.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--DIMENSIONS, IN MILLIMETERS, OF THREE MAXILLARY FRAGMENTS OF\r\nDELORHYNCHUS PRISCUS\r\n\r\nKey:\r\n\r\nA.

The jaw is of a primitive type and\r\narticulates on a level with the tooth-row. The palatal dentition is\r\nprimitive (Romer, 1956:280). The nitosaurids are thought to be related\r\nto the later Caseidae, and the most obvious structural similarities are\r\nfound in the postcranial skeleton (Vaughn, 1958:989). Cranial\r\nresemblances between the families are fewer, but nevertheless indicate\r\nthat a nitosaurid-caseid relationship exists.\r\n\r\nVaughn (1958) described a small pelycosaur, _Colobomycter pholeter_\r\n(Eothyrididae, Ophiacodontia) that structurally resembles the Caseidae.\r\nThis individual also was obtained from the Fort Sill locality. In\r\nVaughn's opinion the features of _Colobomycter_ indicate a close\r\nrelationship between eothyridids and caseids and the possibility that\r\nthe caseids may well have been of eothyridid rather than nitosaurid\r\nderivation.\r\n\r\nIn view of this historical uncertainty of the relationships between the\r\nNitosauridae, the Eothyrididae and the Caseidae, it is well to consider\r\nhow the maxillary fragments described above differ from and resemble\r\nrepresentatives of each of these three families as reported in the\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n_Delorhynchus_ resembles _Colobomycter_ in size. The mean\r\nextra-maxillary length of the undamaged teeth of the three fragments is\r\n2.5 mm., equal to that reported by Vaughn (1958:985) for teeth about\r\nmidway in the postcanine series of _Colobomycter_. None of the teeth of\r\n_Delorhynchus_ extends beyond the maxillary rim as far as does the\r\ncanine of _Colobomycter_ (3.5 mm.).\r\n\r\nThe teeth in both genera are conical and sharply pointed. The naris in\r\neach is enlarged, and the lacrimal is excluded from the narial margin in\r\neach (by inference in _Delorhynchus_.)\r\n\r\nThe differences between the maxillae of _Colobomycter_ and\r\n_Delorhynchus_ are most striking in the lack of canines in the latter\r\nand the correlated absence of modifications of the maxillary for support\r\nof canines. Additionally, _Delorhynchus_ bears an infraorbital canal in\r\ncontrast to the groove in similar position in _Colobomycter_. The\r\nrecurvature of the four teeth present in the fragments of _Delorhynchus_\r\ndiffers from that in the teeth of _Colobomycter_ in which only the\r\ncanine and precanine are recurved. Vaughn implies that anterior and\r\nposterior cutting edges extend the length of the teeth in\r\n_Colobomycter_; these are restricted to the distal third of the teeth in\r\n_Delorhynchus_. The external surfaces of the maxillae of _Delorhynchus_\r\nare pitted and ridged; Vaughn was unable to discern sculpturing of the\r\ncorresponding surfaces in _Colobomycter_.\r\n\r\n_Delorhynchus_ resembles the nitosaurids in size, the shape and\r\nsharpness of the teeth, their recurvature and the slight enlargement of\r\ntheir bases, the exclusion of the lacrimal bone from the narial margin\r\n(in _Mycterosaurus_) and the apparent lack of a special canine pair of\r\nteeth. Resemblances to the caseids are to be noted in the enlargement of\r\nthe naris (4.5 mm. in height as opposed to 1.7 mm. in _Colobomycter_),\r\nlack of development of canines, presence of an infraorbital canal (in\r\n_Cotylorhynchus_) and absence of many replacement gaps in the marginal\r\nrow of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe absence of caniniform enlargement and the extension of the maxilla\r\ndorsad of the naris exclude _Delorhynchus_ from the Eothyrididae\r\n(Ophiacodontia) but are no bar to its inclusion in the Nitosauridae\r\n(Edaphosauria). The marginal teeth of _Delorhynchus_ are simple and\r\nprimitive, being much like those of the nitosaurids that are described\r\nin the literature.\r\n\r\nThe large narial opening and its posterior, dorsal and ventral enclosure\r\nby the maxilla, the infraorbital canal, and the sculptured external\r\nsurfaces of the maxillary fragments indicate that _Delorhynchus_, in\r\nthese features at least, is close to achieving the caseid grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily SPHENACODONTIDAE\r\n\r\n=Thrausmosaurus serratidens= new genus and new species\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Thrausmosaurus_ is formed from the neuter Greek noun, _thrausma_,\r\nmeaning fragment, and the masculine Greek noun, _sauros_, meaning\r\nreptile. The specific name, _serratidens_, is formed from the Latin\r\n_serratus_, meaning serrate, and the masculine Latin noun, _dens_,\r\nmeaning tooth. The specific name is used as a substantive in apposition\r\nwith the generic name.)\r\n\r\n_Type specimen._--Fragmentary left dentary, bearing five teeth, the\r\nmost posterior of which is broken at the base, KU 11120.\r\n\r\n_Referred specimens._--Fragmentary ?left maxilla, having two teeth, KU\r\n11121; fragmentary left dentary having two teeth, KU 11122.\r\n\r\n_Horizon and locality._--From the early Permian fissure deposits in the\r\nArbuckle limestone of the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry,\r\napproximately 6 miles north of Fort Sill, in sec. 31, T. 4N, R. 11 W,\r\nComanche County, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Small; teeth thecodont, compressed laterally, recurved\r\ndistally, and bearing anterior and posterior cutting edges; anterior\r\nserrations limited to recurved portions of teeth, posterior serrations\r\nextending nearly entire length of teeth; lateral compression of teeth\r\nmore pronounced medially than laterally; bases of teeth expanded.\r\n\r\n_Description._--The type specimen is 16 mm. long. It bears five teeth\r\nthat are implanted in a straight row. Empty sockets are present between\r\nthe first and second teeth, and the third and fourth teeth. The first\r\ntooth is 3.0 mm. long, the middle two are each 2.5 mm. long, and the\r\nfourth tooth is 2.0 mm. long. The fifth tooth is broken off at its base.\r\n\r\nThe empty sockets are large. The mouth of each is circular and\r\napproximately 2.0 mm. in diameter. Both sockets are 1.25 mm. deep. The\r\nbases of the teeth are expanded to fill the sockets, although the blades\r\nof the teeth arise from only the lateral portions of the bases. The edge\r\nof the dentary rises above the bases of the teeth medially, thereby\r\nproducing a small depression at the junction of each base with the\r\ndentary bone.\r\n\r\nThe lateral compression of the teeth is pronounced but asymmetrical, in\r\nthat the lateral surface of each blade is more convex than the medial\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURES 4-6. _Thrausmosaurus serratidens_, lower Permian,\r\n6 miles north of Fort Sill, Comanche County, Oklahoma. All × 3.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. KU 11120 (type specimen), lateral view of left dentary.\r\nFIG. 5. KU 11121, lateral view of ?left maxilla.\r\nFIG. 6. KU 11122, lateral view of left dentary.]\r\n\r\nThe recurvature of the anterior cutting edges is much more severe than\r\nthat of the posterior edges, but the recurvature of both is limited to\r\nthe distal half of each tooth.\r\n\r\nThe serrations of the cutting edges are not visible to the naked eye and\r\nare limited on the anterior edges of the teeth to those portions of the\r\nblades that are recurved. The posterior serrations extend nearly to the\r\njunction of the blade of each tooth with its base. The serrations tend\r\nto be more nearly crenulate than cuspidate.\r\n\r\nA portion of the lateral wall of the dentary surrounding the Meckelian\r\ncanal is present. The external surface of the wall is gently convex and\r\nsmooth, without sculpturing. The internal surfaces of the canal are\r\nunmarked either by muscle scars or foramina.\r\n\r\nThe fragment is a piece from the posterior portion of the dentary, since\r\nthe decrease in height from the first tooth to the fourth is pronounced.\r\n\r\nKU 11122, a fragment of the left dentary bearing two teeth, is 7.5 mm.\r\nlong. The anterior tooth is 3.0 mm. long; the posterior tooth is 3.5 mm.\r\nlong. The shape of the teeth and their implantation conform to the\r\ndescription of the type specimen. The lateral surface of the fragment is\r\nsmooth and gently convex. What little is present of the surface\r\nbordering the Meckelian canal is unmarked.\r\n\r\nThe ?maxillary fragment bears two teeth which are 3.0 mm. long, and\r\nwhich conform in their characters to the type. The lateral, medial and\r\nventral surfaces of the fragment have been sheared off, so that an exact\r\nidentification of the bone is impossible. Presumably the fragment is too\r\ndeep dorsoventrally to be a piece of the dentary, and no sign of the\r\nMeckelian canal is present.\r\n\r\n_Discussion._--The implantation, lateral compression, recurvature and\r\ncutting edges of the teeth borne by these fragments make clear their\r\nsphenacodontid nature. The characters of the fragments are too few to\r\ndetermine subfamilial affinities, however. That the fragments are the\r\nremains of adult animals can be only surmised from the lack of bones or\r\nteeth of large pelycosaurs in the extensive collections of the\r\nUniversity of Kansas from the Fort Sill locality.\r\n\r\nIf _Thrausmosaurus_ is, in fact, adult, the genus is an unusually small\r\nsphenacodontid, and of significance both on that account and because of\r\nthe resemblance of the teeth presently known to those of its far larger\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n_The Fort Sill Locality._--Peabody (1961) suggested that the fissures of\r\nFort Sill had been used as dens by predatory animals in the early\r\nPermian, and that the unusually abundant bones in the fissures were the\r\nremains of animals eaten there by these occupants. Evidence now known to\r\nme affords an alternative explanation that is presented here as a\r\npreliminary to a more complete study of the fauna and paleoecology of\r\nthese deposits currently being undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the skeletal material found in the fissures is the\r\nremnant of the prey of other animals is questionable because of:\r\n\r\n     1. The absence of tooth marks on the fossils.\r\n\r\n     2. The recovery from the matrix of skulls and portions of\r\n     articulated skeletons that are undamaged or damaged only by\r\n     pressure after burial.\r\n\r\n     3. The rarity in the deposits of animals of larger body size than\r\n     _Captorhinus_, the exceptions being a few limb fragments and skull\r\n     fragments of labyrinthodont or pelycosaurian nature.\r\n\r\n     4. The absence of coprolites in the matrix.\r\n\r\nIf the fissures were the dens of predators, at least some and probably\r\nmany of the bones would show tooth marks. A predator feeding on other\r\nanimals would be expected to leave some evidence of its habits on the\r\nbones of its prey. No such evidence is known to me, either from my own\r\nexamination of several thousand bones or from the reports in the\r\nliterature by others who have studied aspects of the early Permian fauna\r\nof Fort Sill.\r\n\r\nIf the predators were larger than _Captorhinus_ and occupied the\r\nfissures for a long enough time to account for the accumulation of the\r\ntremendous numbers of individuals that are represented, a considerable\r\namount of the skeletal material of the larger animals would be present\r\nin the fissure deposits. Even if for some reason the predators died in\r\nareas other than within the fissures, thereby accounting for the absence\r\nof large bones, coprolites should appear in the deposits if, in fact,\r\nthe fissures were feeding places. In view of the nearly undamaged\r\ncondition of many of the bones recovered from the fissures, it is\r\nreasonable to expect that fecal material would be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe character of the matrix of the deposits varies from a homogeneous\r\nclay to clay interrupted by layers of soft, limey, conglomeratic rock,\r\nto a hard, well-cemented, calcareous conglomerate. In general the bone\r\nin each kind of matrix is colored characteristically and exhibits a\r\ncharacteristic degree of wear. The bones entrapped in the homogeneous\r\nclay are relatively few, black, usually disarticulated, little worn and\r\nnot unduly fragmented; consequently the discovery of undamaged limb\r\nbones, for example, from this kind of matrix is not unusual. The bones\r\nfound in the stratified portion of the matrix are more numerous within\r\nthe layers of conglomerate than between. The bones are black, brown or\r\nwhite, highly fragmented and waterworn to a variable degree. The\r\nfragments recovered from the hard, calcareous matrix are numerous, range\r\nin color from white through various shades of brown, to black, are\r\nhighly fragmented, and are usually worn by water.\r\n\r\nThese categories for bone and matrix, however, are not mutually\r\nexclusive, since bones of any of these colors and exhibiting any degree\r\nof wear and fragmentation are found in any of the kinds of matrix\r\ndescribed above. That water was the agent of wear is suggested by the\r\nhighly polished appearance of the worn bones and pebbles that are found\r\nin the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe variability of the matrix and of the color and condition of the\r\nbones indicates that the agencies of burial and fossilization differed\r\nfrom time to time and that the agency of transportation of the bones\r\nfrom the site of burial to the fissures was running water. One can\r\neasily visualize a stream coursing the early Permian landscape that was\r\nsubject to periodic flooding and droughts. Along the banks of the stream\r\nand in its pools lived a variety of microsaurs, captorhinids, small\r\nlabyrinthodonts and small pelycosaurs. Some of the animals, after they\r\ndied, were either buried near the site of their death or were swept\r\nalong and buried in sediments further downstream. Burial was for a\r\nlength of time sufficient to impart a color to the bones characteristic\r\nof the site in which they were buried. Later floods reexposed the sites\r\nof burial, picked up the bones and carried them to the openings into the\r\nfissures. Presumably, too, a proportion of the bones was carried to the\r\nfissures without previous burial.\r\n\r\nThe differences in wear exhibited by different bones within the same\r\nblock of matrix is attributable to differences in distance that the\r\nbones were transported before final deposition. The final sites of\r\ndeposition, the fissures, were inundated occasionally by floods alone,\r\nor because of changes in location of the channel of the stream at the\r\ntime of flooding. The periodicity of deposition of the sediments within\r\nportions of the fissures is indicated by the stratification of the bone\r\nconglomerate mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it seems that there is little or no evidence beyond the\r\nnumbers of bones involved to support the hypothesis that the\r\nconcentration of bones in the fissures of Fort Sill represents the\r\nremains of food of predators, and that the fissures were used as dens by\r\ntheir predatory occupants. On the contrary, the evidence indicates that\r\nthe deposition of the bones in the fissures was secondary and that the\r\nagency of transportation, deposition and accumulation of the bones was\r\nan early Permian stream characterized by periodic flooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nPEABODY, F.
