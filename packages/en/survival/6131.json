Scientific details and philosophical speculations\r\nare accordingly avoided. Nevertheless, a perusal of the following\r\npages may so stimulate the curiosity of youthful minds, that some,\r\non attaining to riper years and more mature understanding, may be\r\ninspired with a longing to inquire more deeply into this\r\ninteresting subject. They may be stimulated to investigate, in a\r\nphilosophical spirit, all the marvellous facts and phenomena\r\nconnected with volcanic agency, and to speculate on their causes\r\nand modes of operation. Some also, on reaching their manhood, may\r\nbe induced to ascend one or more of the nearer active volcanoes,\r\nand examine their phenomena for themselves. The facilities of\r\ntravel are now so great, that a visit to Vesuvius or Etna is no\r\nlonger beyond the limits of a holiday trip. Even the more remote\r\nHecla with the playful Geysers may be reached within a reasonable\r\ntime. Perhaps a very few, who are now scientific travellers in\r\nembryo, may call to remembrance what they may have read in these\r\npages, when, many years hence, they may be climbing the cone of\r\nCotopaxi, or peering into the crater of Kilauea.\r\n\r\nApart from these considerations, a perusal of this work may enable\r\nthe young mind to form a more lively idea of the tremendous energy\r\nof the forces which are imprisoned in the bowels of the earth. Such\r\na vivid conception will naturally lead to a higher appreciation of\r\nthe wisdom and power of Him who guides the operation of those\r\nforces by his laws, and has set bounds to their activity which they\r\ncannot overpass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes in general--Origin of the Name--General\r\nAspect--Crater--Cone--Subordinate Cones and Craters--Peak

This name for a burning\r\nmountain was first applied to that which exists in the island\r\nanciently called Hiera, one of the Lipari group. It is derived from\r\nthe name of the heathen god Vulcan, which was originally spelt with\r\nan initial B, as appears from an ancient altar on which were\r\ninscribed the words BOLCANO SAC. ARA. This spelling indicates the\r\ntrue derivation of the name, which is simply a corruption of\r\nTubal-cain, who was \"an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron\"\r\n(Gen. iv. 22). The ancient heathen, having deified this personage,\r\nimagined, on first seeing a burning mountain, that Tubal-cain, or\r\nVulcan, must have established his forge in the heart of it, and so,\r\nnot unnaturally, named it Volcano--an appellation which the Island\r\nof Hiera retains to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclops--the supposed descendants of Vulcan, who were fabled to\r\nhave been of gigantic stature, and to have had each only one eye in\r\nthe centre of the forehead--were imagined to be the workmen who\r\nlaboured in these underground forges. The noises, proceeding from\r\nthe heart of the mountain, were attributed to their operations. It\r\nis to the Island of Hiera that Virgil alludes in the Æneid, lib.\r\nviii. 416. The passage is thus rendered by Dryden:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,\r\n      Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,\r\n      Raised high on smoking rocks, and deep below,\r\n      In hollow caves the fires of Etna glow.\r\n      The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;\r\n      Loud strokes and hissings of tormented steel\r\n      Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,\r\n      And smoky flames through fuming tunnels soar.\"\r\n\r\nA volcano generally presents itself to the imagination as a\r\nmountain sending forth from its summit great clouds of smoke with\r\nvast sheets of flame, and it is not unfrequently so described. The\r\ntruth is, however, that a real volcano seldom emits either true\r\nsmoke or true flame. What is mistaken for smoke consists merely of\r\nvast volumes of fine dust, mingled with much steam and other\r\nvapours--chiefly sulphurous. What appears like flames is simply the\r\nglare from the glowing materials which are thrown up towards the\r\ntop of the mountain--this glare being reflected from the clouds of\r\ndust and steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Peak of Teneriffe.]\r\n\r\nThe most essential part of a volcano is the crater, a hollow basin,\r\ngenerally of a circular form. It is often of large dimensions, and\r\nsometimes of vast depth. Some volcanoes consist of a crater alone,\r\nwith scarcely any mountain at all; but in the majority of cases the\r\ncrater is situated on the top of a mountain, which in some\r\ninstances towers to an enormous height. The part of the mountain\r\nwhich terminates in the principal crater is usually of a conical\r\nform--much like a glass-house chimney, and is therefore named the\r\ncone. It is generally composed of loose ashes and cinders, with\r\nhere and there masses of stone, which have been tossed into the air\r\nby the volcanic forces. In some mountains the cone rises out of a\r\nhollow at a considerable height from the base. A hollow of this\r\nkind is generally regarded as having been a former crater, which\r\nhad become extinct before the existing cone was raised. There are\r\nsometimes formed lower down the mountain subordinate craters,\r\nsmaller than that which occupies the summit of the cone. Within the\r\ncrater itself there are frequently numerous little cones, from\r\nwhich vapours are continually issuing, with occasional volleys of\r\nashes and stones.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest and most perfect of the volcanic cones in the\r\nworld is that of the Peak of Teneriffe, of which you have here a\r\nrepresentation. It conveys a good idea of the general form of the\r\ncone, and has long been a conspicuous and useful landmark to\r\nmariners. It is upwards of twelve thousand feet in height, and is\r\nsaid to be visible in very clear weather at a distance of a hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting products of an active volcano are the streams\r\nof lava which it pours forth--sometimes from the principal crater\r\non the summit--sometimes from the smaller craters lower down. This\r\nlava consists of melted stone. When it issues from the mountain its\r\nheat is intense and it glows like a furnace, so that, during the\r\nnight especially, these fiery rivers present a grand yet awful\r\nspectacle. The streams spread themselves till they sometimes attain\r\na breadth of several miles, with a depth of several hundred feet,\r\nand they flow onward till their length sometimes reaches fifty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nLava, not being so liquid as water, does not flow so rapidly:\r\nnevertheless, when it is careering down the sides of a mountain, or\r\nwhere the slope of the ground is considerable, it advances with\r\ngreat speed. Even when at its hottest, it is somewhat viscid, like\r\ntreacle, and this viscidness increases as it cools. Hence on a\r\nlevel plain, and at some distance from its source, the lava-stream\r\nadvances at a leisurely pace. In such circumstances the cooling\r\nproceeds so quickly that a crust of considerable thickness is soon\r\nformed on the top of the current, and persons who are bold enough\r\nmay cross the stream by means of this natural bridge. Even where\r\nthe current continues flowing rapidly, this crust may be formed on\r\nits surface; and a man, whose curiosity exceeds his prudence, may\r\nstand on the top of it, bore a hole through the crust, and see the\r\nlava flowing underneath his feet!\r\n\r\nNothing can resist the progress of the lava-flood; trees, houses,\r\neverything yields to its massive assault, The trees take fire\r\nbefore its approach, and when it reaches them they emit a hissing\r\nnoise almost amounting to a shriek, and then plunging into the\r\nmolten flood are seen no more. Even the sea cannot withstand the\r\nlava-stream, but retires on its approach; so that promontories\r\nstretching to a considerable distance from the shore are formed in\r\nthis manner, when the molten matter hardens into stone.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of lava are sometimes attended by peculiarities which\r\nimpart to them much additional grandeur. Instances have occurred in\r\nwhich the fiery stream has plunged over a sheer precipice of\r\nimmense height, so as to produce a glowing cascade exceeding in\r\nbreadth and perpendicular descent the celebrated Falls of Niagara.\r\nIn other cases, the lava, instead of at once flowing down the sides\r\nof the mountain, has been first thrown up into the air as a fiery\r\nfountain several hundred feet in height. This happens when the\r\ngreat crater at the summit of the cone is full of liquid lava but\r\ndoes not overflow. Then, on the formation of an opening in the side\r\nof the cone, a good way down, the lava issuing from it is projected\r\nupwards to nearly the same height that it occupies in the interior\r\nof the crater at the top of the cone. It is hardly possible for the\r\nfancy to picture to itself anything so magnificent as such a\r\nfountain of liquid fire must be. A simple jet of water of\r\nconsiderable volume, thrown into the air to the height of a hundred\r\nfeet, is itself a beautiful spectacle. What then must be a huge jet\r\nof glowing white lava projected to the height of several hundred\r\nfeet, and with what an awful thundering sound must it come tumbling\r\nto the ground, thence to rush as a roaring torrent down the\r\nmountain's side!\r\n\r\nLava, when congealed, differs in its consistency according as it is\r\nnear the top or near the bottom of the stream. When near the top it\r\nis porous, owing to its rapid cooling; when near the bottom it is\r\ndense, owing to its slow cooling and the great pressure to which it\r\nis subjected. When the lighter superficial lava is brought suddenly\r\ninto contact with water, as when a lava-stream enters the sea, it\r\nbecomes still lighter and more porous--forming the well-known\r\nsubstance called pumice, so much used for polishing. It may be\r\nregarded as the solidified froth of lava, and is so light that it\r\nfloats on the surface of water.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of different mountains, when cooled and hardened, differ\r\nmuch in their appearance and composition. Among those of Iceland is\r\nfound the beautiful black volcanic glass named obsidian. It is a\r\ngood deal used for ornamental purposes; for it possesses the\r\npeculiar property of presenting a different appearance according to\r\nthe manner in which it is cut. When cut in one direction it is of a\r\nbeautiful jetty black; when cut across that direction it is\r\nglistering gray. The lavas of Vesuvius are generally of a brown\r\ncolour, and are also used in the arts. In them are found the\r\nbeautiful olive-green crystals of the mineral called olivine,\r\nsometimes used by jewellers. But the most useful of all volcanic\r\nproductions is native sulphur, in which Mount Etna has been very\r\nprolific. It is to this mountain chiefly, therefore, that we are\r\nindebted for our beautiful fire-works--our squibs, crackers, Roman\r\ncandles, serpents, Catherine-wheels, and sky-rockets. Would it had\r\nproduced nothing more harmful than these! But it has also supplied\r\none of the ingredients of that villainous gunpowder, which has been\r\nthe means of thrusting so many of our fellow-creatures prematurely\r\nout of the world. Etna, however, can hardly be held responsible for\r\nthis sad misuse of the valuable substance which it affords; while\r\neven gunpowder itself has, on the whole, been of vast benefit to\r\nmankind. Could we only refrain from shooting each other with it, we\r\nmight regard it as an almost unmixed good; for it has helped us\r\ngreatly in forming our roads, railways, and tunnels, and in working\r\nour quarries and mines.\r\n\r\nIn all great eruptions the flow of the lava is preceded by the\r\nejection of vast quantities of volcanic dust, ashes, dross, slag,\r\nand loose stones. These are tossed into the air with tremendous\r\nviolence, consequently, to a great height. The stones thus ejected\r\nare sometimes of immense size. A rock, whose weight is estimated at\r\ntwo hundred tons, was thrown from the summit of Cotopaxi to the\r\ndistance of more than ten miles. Large stones have been tossed up\r\nby Vesuvius to the estimated height of three thousand six hundred\r\nfeet. The dust of the volcano of St. Vincent was carried more than\r\ntwo hundred miles to the eastward in the teeth of the trade wind;\r\nconsequently it must have been thrown to an enormous height, in\r\norder to its falling at so vast a distance from its source.\r\n\r\nBesides the usual volcanic dust and ashes, there is sometimes\r\nthrown from the crater of a volcano a substance resembling spun-glass\r\nor asbestos. It possesses the flexibility and lustre of silk.\r\nThe volcano of Salazes, in the Island of Bourbon, is remarkable for\r\nthis substance, and it has there been seen to form a cloud covering\r\nthe entire surface of the mountain. But it has also been found in\r\nother places. How curious it would be to have this volcanic silk\r\nspun into threads, and knitted into stockings or woven into a\r\ngarment! Who can tell what may happen in these days of adventure\r\nand invention? Who knows but what some young reader, whose eye is\r\nnow resting on this page, may yet live to present his ladylove with\r\na pair of knitted gloves composed of the volcanic silk of Salazes?\r\n\r\nGreat as the contrast is between this filmy material and the\r\nponderous blocks tossed into the air by Cotopaxi and Etna, it is\r\nnot greater than that between the latter and other masses which\r\nhave from time to time been upheaved by volcanic forces. Instances\r\nhave occurred of whole islands having been raised from the bed of\r\nthe ocean, or whole mountains upreared on the surface of the land,\r\nfar away from the sea, and that too in the short space of a few\r\nhours. But of such we shall have occasion to speak more at large in\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\nOf all the extraordinary productions that have ever been thrown up\r\nby volcanoes, the strangest of all are fishes. How droll to dine\r\nupon fish cooked in a volcano! A queer fish it must be that likes\r\nto dwell in the bowels of a mountain--more especially of one whose\r\nentrails are mostly of liquid fire. But of this also more fully\r\nanon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the solid materials thrown out by volcanoes, there\r\nare sometimes poured forth torrents of boiling water and liquid\r\nmud. More frequently, however, the water issues in the form of vast\r\ncolumns of steam and sulphurous vapour. These ascend to great\r\nheights in the air, and becoming gradually chilled, they form\r\nimmense masses of dark heavy clouds, similar to those we observe\r\nbefore a thunderstorm. Nor is this resemblance apparent only. For\r\nthe clouds that overhang an active volcano during an eruption of\r\nits vapours are, in reality, thunderclouds highly charged with\r\nelectricity. They accordingly produce what Baron Humboldt calls the\r\nvolcanic storm. It includes all the most terrible of atmospheric\r\nphenomena--lightnings of extraordinary vividness; thunders that\r\npeal and reverberate as if they would rend the echoes asunder;\r\ntorrents of rain that pour down upon the mountain and its\r\nneighbourhood, hissing like thousands of serpents when they fall on\r\nthe glowing lava-torrent; and whirlwinds that sweep the volcanic\r\nashes round and round in vast eddies, and before whose violence no\r\nman of mortal mould is able for a moment to stand.\r\n\r\nBeyond and above this din of contending elements are heard the\r\nhoarse bellowings of the mountain itself, which, meanwhile,\r\ntrembles to its very core. The detonations from the volcano far\r\nexceed in loudness any other earthly noise. Compared with these,\r\nthe pealing of the loudest thunder is but as the report of a musket\r\ncontrasted with the simultaneous discharge of a thousand pieces of\r\nheavy ordnance. The explosions of Tomboro, and the vibrations\r\naccompanying them, have been heard and felt at almost incredible\r\ndistances. Judge, then, of the immensity of the forces which are\r\nthus brought into play, and the overwhelming grandeur of the scene\r\nwhich such an eruption, with all its accompaniments of storm and\r\ntempest, must present to the bewildered eye and ear. Even to read\r\nof it sends a thrill through the nerves: what, then, must it be to\r\nlisten and behold?\r\n\r\nSo far do we dwell from the nearest volcanoes, and so little are we\r\nfamiliar with the names except of a few, that not many persons are\r\naware of the large number of burning mountains on the face of our\r\nglobe. The total number, however, of those which are known to have\r\nbeen active within historic times is fully two hundred. Of these,\r\nthe most familiar to us for its classic fame and its restless\r\nactivity is Mount Vesuvius, which stands alone in its grandeur on\r\nthe continent of Europe. The most violent in its activity is\r\nTomboro, in the island of Sumbáwa. The highest is Cotopaxi, in the\r\nrange of the Andes, which rises far into the region of perpetual\r\nsnow. Its height is 16,800 feet above the level of the sea. Strange\r\nit seems, that volcanic fires should glow at such a height in the\r\nmidst of snow and ice. But in this particular Cotopaxi does not\r\nstand alone. The Peak of Teneriffe, Mount Etna, and several others,\r\nalso rise above the snow-line; while the burning mountains of\r\nIceland, Greenland, and Kamtschatka, with those which rear their\r\nheads in the frozen regions near the South Pole, are for the most\r\npart enveloped in ice and snow from head to foot.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe to you some of the more interesting\r\nof the individual volcanoes and volcanic groups, it may be well to\r\nlet you into a secret worth knowing. You would doubtless like to\r\nhave a volcano all to yourself. Here is the receipt: Buy several\r\npounds of clean iron filings, and a somewhat larger quantity of the\r\nflowers of sulphur. Mix the two together and knead them well with\r\nwater into a stiffish paste. Then wrap this pudding in a cloth, and\r\nput another cloth about it, which has been smeared with common or\r\ncoal-tar. Dig a hole in some quiet corner of your garden, pop your\r\ndumpling into it, and cover it well up with earth, treading it down\r\nfirmly with your feet. Not many hours will elapse before you will\r\nsee the ground swell like a molehill; an eruption will ensue, and\r\nyou will be the happy possessor of a Stromboli of your own!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes of Iceland--Mount Hecla--Earliest Eruption--Great\r\nEruption in 1845--Skaptàr Yökul--Terrible Eruption in 1783--Rise\r\nand Disappearance of Nyoë--Katlugaia--The Geysers--A very hot Bath\r\n--Californian Geysers--Iceland-spar--Jan Mayen\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with the volcanoes of Iceland, of which the most\r\ninteresting and active is Mount Hecla. The annexed woodcut will\r\ngive you an idea of its appearance. You will observe the column of\r\nvolcanic vapour ascending from the snow-clad summit of the cone,\r\nand how dreary and desolate is the aspect of the country at its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded eruption of Mount Hecla took place in the\r\nninth century of the Christian era; but probably there had been\r\nmany before that date. Since then there have been between twenty\r\nand thirty considerable eruptions of this mountain, and it has\r\nsometimes remained in a state of activity for upwards of six years\r\nwith little intermission. It took a long rest, however, of more\r\nthan sixty years' duration, prior to the year 1845, when it again\r\nburst forth. After a violent storm on the night of the 2nd of\r\nSeptember in that year, the surface of the ground in the Orkney\r\nIslands was found strown with volcanic dust. There was thus\r\nconveyed to the inhabitants of Great Britain an intimation that\r\nHecla had been again at work. Accordingly, tidings soon after\r\narrived of a great eruption of the mountain. On the night of the\r\n1st of September, the dwellers in its neighbourhood were terrified\r\nby a fearful underground groaning, which continued till mid-day on\r\nthe 2nd. Then, with a tremendous crash, there were formed in the\r\nsides of the cone two large openings, whence there gushed torrents\r\nof lava, which flowed down two gorges on the flanks of the\r\nmountain. The whole summit was enveloped in clouds of vapour and\r\nvolcanic dust. The neighbouring rivers became so hot as to kill the\r\nfish, and the sheep fled in terror from the adjoining heaths, some\r\nbeing burnt before they could escape.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 15th of September, two new openings were\r\nformed--one on the eastern, and the other on the southern slope--from\r\nboth of which lava was discharged for twenty-two hours. It\r\nflowed to a distance of upwards of twenty miles, killing many\r\ncattle and destroying a large tract of pasturage. Twelve miles from\r\nthe crater, the lava-stream was between forty and fifty feet deep\r\nand nearly a mile in width. On the 12th of October a fresh torrent\r\nof lava burst forth, and heaped up another similar mass. The\r\nmountain continued in a state of activity up to April 1846; then it\r\nrested for a while, and began again in the following month of\r\nOctober. Since then, however, it has enjoyed repose.\r\n\r\nThe effects of these eruptions were disastrous. The whole island\r\nwas strown with volcanic ashes, which, where they did not smother\r\nthe grass outright, gave it a poisonous taint. The cattle that ate\r\nof it were attacked by a murrain, of which great numbers died. The\r\nice and snow, which had gathered about the mountain for a long\r\nperiod of time, were wholly melted by the heat. Masses of pumice\r\nweighing nearly half a ton were thrown to a distance of between\r\nfour and five miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Mount Hecla]\r\n\r\nMount Hecla is not the only volcano in Iceland. There are several\r\nothers; and from one of them, named Skaptàr Yökul, there was, in\r\nthe year 1783, an eruption still more violent than that from Hecla\r\nabove described. It began on the 8th of June, and raged with little\r\nabatement till the end of August, whence onward it continued, but\r\nwith less violence, till the following year. The lava, in this\r\ncase, poured from numerous openings; but these rivulets ultimately\r\nunited themselves into two large currents, which flowed onwards to\r\nthe sea. In their progress, these burning torrents filled up the\r\nbeds of two considerable rivers. The greater of the two streams,\r\nafter it had ceased to flow and had become a solid mass of rock,\r\nmeasured fifty miles in length, and between twelve and fifteen\r\nmiles in breadth. Its average depth on the plains was about a\r\nhundred feet; but in the bed of the river, which it had filled, it\r\nwas not less than six hundred feet. The snow and ice, which had\r\npreviously covered the mountain, were not only melted, but the\r\nwater that flowed from them was raised to the boiling point, and\r\npoured down with destructive effect on the plains. The dust and\r\nashes thrown into the air darkened the sun; and they were then\r\nstrown over the surface of the island, destroying all the pastures,\r\nso that many thousands of cattle, horses, and sheep perished. But\r\nworse than that, upwards of nine thousand persons lost their lives\r\nby this dreadful catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAbout a month before this great eruption of Skaptàr Yökul, a\r\nvolcanic island was thrown up from the sea, at a distance of about\r\nseventy miles from Iceland. So great was the quantity of ashes and\r\ndross ejected from its crater, that it overspread the sea to a\r\ndistance of a hundred and fifty miles, forming a crust which\r\nobstructed the progress of ships. Portions of this crust floated as\r\nfar as the Shetland and Orkney islands. The King of Denmark named\r\nthis fiery apparition \"Nyoë,\" or \"New Island,\" and doubtless prided\r\nhimself not a little on this addition to his limited dominions.\r\nBut, alas, for human ambition! About a year after the date of its\r\nfirst appearance, Nyoë sank into the depths out of which it arose,\r\nand its position is now marked only by a moderate shoal.\r\n\r\nIt is not by their ejected lavas alone that the volcanoes of\r\nIceland produce their destructive effects. Disastrous consequences\r\nhave frequently resulted from the sudden melting of their snows and\r\nglaciers, on which the volcanic fires operate far more rapidly than\r\ndoes the heat of the sun. It is chiefly by the vast quantities of\r\nearth, sand, stones, and broken fragments of rock, which they hurry\r\nalong with them in their wild career, that the waters, so suddenly\r\nfreed, produce the greatest amount of damage. During an eruption of\r\nKatlugaia, one of the southern Icelandic volcanoes, in 1756, the\r\nmass of material thus carried down by the melted snows and glaciers\r\nwas so great, that, advancing several leagues into the sea, it\r\nformed three parallel promontories, which rose above the sea-level,\r\nwhere there had formerly been a depth of forty fathoms of water.\r\nVast ravines were, at the same time, scooped out of the sides of\r\nthe mountain by the erosion of the waters. Another eruption of this\r\nvolcano in 1860 produced similar results.\r\n\r\nStill more interesting than the volcanic mountains of Iceland are\r\nits Geysers, or intermittent springs of boiling water. The chief of\r\nthese is the Great Geyser. A jet rises to a vast height, and is\r\naccompanied by much steam. Indeed, it is quite at the boiling-point.\r\n\r\nThe little mound, from the top of which the jet appears to rise, is\r\ncomposed of a substance named siliceous sinter, and is a deposit\r\nfrom the water of the fountain. At the top of this mound, which is\r\nbetween six and seven feet in height, there is an oval basin,\r\nmeasuring about fifty-six feet in one direction, and about forty-six\r\nin the other; its average depth is about three feet. In the\r\ncentre of this basin is a round hole, about ten feet in diameter,\r\nout of which the water springs. This hole is the mouth of a\r\ncircular well, between seventy and eighty feet in depth. It is down\r\nthis well that the jet retires on its disappearance; and it drags\r\nalong with it all the water out of the basin, leaving both basin\r\nand well quite empty, without even a puff of steam coming out of\r\nthe hole. In this state of emptiness the basin and well remain for\r\nseveral hours. Suddenly the water begins to rise in the well,\r\noverflowing till it fills the basin. Loud explosions are heard from\r\nbelow, and the ground trembles. Then, with amazing violence, up\r\nsprings a vast column of boiling water, surmounted by clouds of\r\nsteam, which obscure the air. This first jet is followed by several\r\nothers in rapid succession, to the number of sixteen or eighteen;\r\nthe last jet being usually the greatest of all, and attaining a\r\nheight of nearly a hundred feet. In some instances it has risen to\r\na height of a hundred and fifty feet; and one particular jet was\r\nmeasured which rose to the amazing height of two hundred and twelve\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe action of the fountain seldom continues more than about five\r\nminutes at a time, and then a repose of several hours ensues. If\r\nleft to itself, the periods of the fountain's activity, though not\r\nquite regular, generally recur at intervals of six or seven hours.\r\nBut they may be hastened by throwing big stones down the well. This\r\nnot only hurries the eruption of the jet, but increases its energy,\r\nand the stones are thrown out with great force by the column of\r\nboiling water; the loudness of the explosions being also\r\nconsiderably augmented.\r\n\r\nThere are several other geysers in the island besides this big one.\r\nTheir jets are smaller, but to compensate this deficiency, they are\r\nmore frequent in their ascent; so that travellers who are too\r\nimpatient to await the eruptions of the Great Geyser, content\r\nthemselves with visiting the little ones.\r\n\r\nWould it not be very convenient to live near a geyser? We might\r\nhave our victuals cooked by it, and have pipes led from it all\r\nround our house, to keep us comfortable in winter; and we might\r\nhave nice hot baths in our dressing-rooms, arid even a little\r\nsteam-engine to roast our meat and grind our coffee. But perhaps\r\nyou may think it might not be altogether pleasant to be kept so\r\ncontinually in hot water.\r\n\r\nWere any of the water from the geyser to fall on your hands, you\r\nwould doubtless feel it rather sore; still more so, were you to be\r\nso rash as to thrust your hand fairly into the jet of boiling\r\nwater, as it ascends into the air. Nevertheless, strange as it may\r\nseem, it would be possible for you, without feeling any pain or\r\nsustaining any injury, to thrust your hand right into the glowing\r\nlava as it flows from the crater of Hecla. The only precaution\r\nneedful to be observed, is first to plunge the hand into cold\r\nwater, and then dry it gently with a soft towel, but so as to leave\r\nit still a little moist. This discovery was made by a French\r\nphilosopher, M. Boutigny, and has been practically proved both by\r\nhim and M. Houdin, the celebrated conjuror, by thrusting their\r\nhands into molten iron, as it flowed from the furnace. The latter\r\ndescribes the sensation as like what one might imagine to be felt\r\non putting the hand into liquid velvet.[1] The reason why this\r\nexperiment proves so harmless is that between the skin and the\r\nglowing substance there is formed a film of vapour, which acts as a\r\ncomplete protection. It is this elastic cushion of vapour which\r\nimparts that feeling of softness described by M. Houdin; for it is\r\nwith it alone that the hand comes into contact.\r\n\r\n[1. Houdin's Autobiography, ii 270]\r\n\r\nGeysers have been recently discovered in California; but the jets\r\ndo not rise higher than twenty or thirty feet. They are, however,\r\nvery numerous, there being upwards of a hundred openings within a\r\nspace of half a mile square. The vapour from the whole group rises\r\nto upwards of a hundred and fifty feet into the air. The boiling\r\nwater issues from conical mounds, with great noise. The whole\r\nground around them is a mere crust, and when it is penetrated the\r\nboiling water is seen underneath. The Californian geysers, however,\r\nare impregnated, not with silica, like those of Iceland, but with\r\nsulphur, of which they form large deposits. The sulphurous vapours\r\nfrom the water corrode the rocks near the fountains; nevertheless\r\ntrees grow, without injury to their health, at a distance from them\r\nof not more than fifty feet.\r\n\r\nBesides obsidian, already mentioned as a product of its volcanoes,\r\nIceland is famed for another mineral of great scientific value. It\r\nis that fine variety of carbonate of lime named Iceland-spar.\r\nTransparent and colourless, like glass, this mineral possesses the\r\nproperty of double refraction--any small object viewed through it\r\nin a particular direction appearing double. It is much used for\r\noptical purposes--especially for obtaining polarized light.\r\n\r\nThere is another volcano lying far to the northward of Iceland. It\r\nis in the island of Jan Mayen, off the coast of Greenland, and has\r\non its summit a vast crater, 2000 feet in diameter, and 500 in\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius--Origin of Name--Former Condition--Eruption of A D\r\n79--Death of Pliny--Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum--Appearance\r\nof the Mountain before and after Eruption--Formation of\r\nMonte Nuovo--Eruption of Boiling Water--Coloured Vapours--Cascade\r\nof Lava--Discovery of Remains of Herculaneum and Pompeii--The\r\nBuildings of Pompeii--Street of Tombs--Skeletons--Sundry Shops--Ascents\r\nof Vesuvius--Crater--Temple of Serapis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the continent of\r\nEurope, and it is highly interesting both from its historical\r\nassociations and the frequency of its eruptions. It is situated on\r\nthe coast of the Bay of Naples, about six miles to the eastward of\r\nthe city and at a short distance from the shore. It forms a\r\nconspicuous feature in the beautiful landscape presented by that\r\nbay, when viewed from the sea, with the city in the foreground.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius was in ancient times held sacred to the deified hero\r\nHercules, and the town of Herculaneum, built at its base, was named\r\nafter him. So also, it is said, was the mountain itself, though in\r\na more round-about way. Hercules, as you will doubtless learn, was\r\nfeigned to have been the son of the heathen god Zeus and Alcmena, a\r\nTheban lady. Now one of the appellations of Zeus was Υης,\r\nwhich was applied to him as being the god of rains and dews--the\r\nwet divinity. Thus Hercules was Υησουυιος, the son of Ves. How\r\nthis name should have become corrupted into \"Vesuvius,\" you can be\r\nat no loss to perceive.\r\n\r\nVesuvius was not always a volcano. It was for many ages a very\r\npeaceable and well-behaved mountain. Ancient writers describe it as\r\nhaving been covered with gardens and vineyards, except at the top\r\nwhich was craggy. Within a large circle of nearly perpendicular\r\ncliffs, was a flat space sufficient for the encampment of an army.\r\nThis was doubtless an ancient crater; but nobody in those times\r\nknew anything of its history. So little was the volcanic nature of\r\nthe mountain suspected, that the Roman towns of Stabiæ, Pompeii,\r\nand Herculaneum had been erected at its base, and their inhabitants\r\ndwelt in fancied security.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 63, however, the dwellers in the cities got a\r\ngreat fright; for the mountain shook violently, and a good many\r\nhouses were thrown down. But soon all became quiet again, and the\r\npeople set about rebuilding the houses that had fallen. They\r\ncontinued to live in apparent safety for some time longer. They\r\ndanced, they sung, they feasted; they married, and were altogether\r\nas merry a set of citizens as any in southern Italy. But the 24th\r\nof August A.D. 79 at length arrived. Then, woe to Stabiæ! woe to\r\nPompeii! woe to Herculaneum!\r\n\r\nPliny the elder was that day in command of the Roman fleet at\r\nMisenum, which was not far off. His family were with him, and,\r\namong others, his nephew, Pliny the younger, who has left an\r\ninteresting account of what happened on the occasion. He observed\r\nan extraordinary dense cloud ascending in the direction of\r\nVesuvius, of which he says:--\"I cannot give you a more exact\r\ndescription of its figure, than by resembling it to that of a pine\r\ntree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk,\r\nwhich spread out at the top into a sort of branches. It appeared\r\nsometimes bright, and sometimes dark and spotted, as it was either\r\nmore or less impregnated with earth and cinders\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing this remarkable appearance, the elder Pliny, who was a\r\ngreat naturalist and a man of inquiring mind, resolved to go ashore\r\nand inspect more narrowly what was going on. But a rash resolve it\r\nproved. Steering towards Retina (now Resina), a port at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, he was met, on his approach, by thick showers of hot\r\ncinders, which grew thicker and hotter as he advanced--falling on\r\nthe ships along with lumps of pumice and pieces of rock, black but\r\nburning hot. Vast fragments came rolling down the mountain and\r\ngathered in heaps upon the shore. Then the sea began suddenly to\r\nretreat, so that landing at this point became impracticable. He\r\ntherefore steered for Stabiæ, where he landed, and took up his\r\nabode with Pomponianus--an intimate friend.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, flames appeared to issue from several parts of the\r\nmountain with great violence--the darkness of the night heightening\r\ntheir glare. Pliny nevertheless went to sleep. Soon, however, the\r\ncourt leading to his chamber became almost filled with stones and\r\nashes; so his servants awoke him, and he joined Pomponianus and his\r\nhousehold. The house now began to rock violently to and fro; while\r\noutside, stones and cinders were falling in showers. They,\r\nnotwithstanding, thought it safer to make their way out from the\r\ntottering mansion; so, tying pillows upon their heads with napkins,\r\nthey sallied forth. Although it was now day, the darkness was\r\ndeeper than that of the blackest night. By the aid of torches and\r\nlanterns, however, they groped their way towards the beach, with a\r\nview to escape by sea; but they found the waves too high and\r\ntumultuous. Here Pliny, having drunk some cold water, lay down upon\r\na sailcloth which was spread for him; when almost immediately\r\nflames, preceded by a strong smell of sulphur, issuing from the\r\nground, scattered the company and forced him to rise. With the help\r\nof two of his servants he succeeded in raising himself; but, choked\r\nby some noxious vapour, he instantly fell down dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Vesuvius Before the Eruption of A.D. 79.]\r\n\r\nNor was he alone in his death; for although many of the inhabitants\r\nof the devoted cities were able to effect their escape; yet, so\r\nsuddenly did the overwhelming shower of ashes, cinders, and stones\r\nfall upon them, that not a few of them perished in their dwellings\r\nor their streets. As for the cities themselves, they were utterly\r\nburied completely out of sight, and, like other things that are\r\nlong out of sight, they soon became also buried out of mind. For\r\nmany centuries they remained entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\nYou will doubtless like to know how Vesuvius looked, after doing so\r\nmuch mischief. Here is a picture showing what like it was\r\nimmediately before the eruption; and one showing its appearance\r\nsoon after the event. On comparing the two, you will observe the\r\nmountain had undergone a great change. It was no longer flat on the\r\ntop, but had formed for itself a large cone, from the summit of\r\nwhich dense vapours ascended. This cone was composed entirely of\r\nthe ashes, cinders, and loose stones, thrown up during the\r\neruption. It had become separated by a deep ravine from the\r\nremainder of the former summit, which afterwards came to be\r\ndistinguished by the name Monte Somma. The whole of the forests,\r\nvineyards, and other luxuriant vegetation, which had covered that\r\nportion of the sides of Vesuvius where the eruption took place,\r\nwere destroyed. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast\r\nbetween the beautiful appearance of the mountain before this\r\ncatastrophe, and its desolate aspect after the sad event. This\r\nremarkable contrast forms the subject of one of Martial's Epigrams,\r\nlib. iv. Ep. 44. It is thus rendered by Mr. Addison:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Vesuvius after the Eruption of A.D. 79.]\r\n\r\n     \"Vesuvius covered with the fruitful vine\r\n      Here flourished once, and ran with floods of wine.\r\n      Here Bacchus oft to the cool shades retired,\r\n      And his own native Nysa less admired.\r\n      Oft to the mountain's airy tops advanced,\r\n      The frisking Satyrs on the summit danced.\r\n      Alcides [1] here, here Venus graced the shore,\r\n      Nor loved her favourite Lacedaemon more.\r\n      Now piles of ashes, spreading all around,\r\n      In undistinguished heaps deform the ground.\r\n      The gods themselves the ruined seats bemoan,\r\n      And blame the mischiefs that themselves have done.\"\r\n\r\n[1. Hercules]\r\n\r\nSince the eruption of A.D. 79, Vesuvius has had many fits of\r\nactivity with intervals of rest. In A.D. 472, it threw out so great\r\na quantity of ashes, that they overspread all Europe, and filled\r\neven Constantinople with alarm. In A.D. 1036 occurred the first\r\neruption in which there was any ejection of lava. This eruption was\r\nfollowed by five others, the last of which occurred in 1500. To\r\nthese succeeded a long rest of about a hundred and thirty years,\r\nduring which the mountain had again become covered with gardens and\r\nvineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater had become\r\nclothed with shrubbery.\r\n\r\nIn this interval, however, there was an extraordinary eruption--not\r\nof Vesuvius itself, but at no great distance from it, in the Bay of\r\nBaiæ, on the opposite shore of the Bay of Naples. The whole of\r\nthis neighbourhood is a volcanic country, and was anciently named\r\nthe Phlegræan Fields. It contains a crater in a state of subdued\r\nactivity, called the Solfatara; an extinct volcano having a large\r\ncrater called Monte Barbaro; and Lake Avernus, also supposed to be\r\nan extinct volcanic crater. Between Monte Barbaro and the sea,\r\nthere was formerly a fiat piece of ground bordering on the Lucrine\r\nLake, which is separated from the Bay of Baiæ by a narrow strip of\r\nshingle. On the 29th of September 1538, the flat piece of ground\r\nabove mentioned became the scene of a great eruption, which\r\nresulted in the throwing up of a new elevation to the height of\r\nfour hundred and thirteen feet, and with a circumference of eight\r\nthousand feet. It received the name of Monte Nuovo, and is now\r\ncovered with a luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn 1631 there was another dreadful eruption of Mount Vesuvius,\r\nwhich covered with lava most of the villages at the foot of the\r\nmountain. To add to the calamity, torrents of boiling water were,\r\non this occasion, thrown out by the volcano, producing awful\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThere have been since that time numerous eruptions, which it would\r\nbe tedious to mention in detail; but two of them are worthy of\r\nnotice. During an eruption in February 1848, a column of vapours\r\narose from the crater about forty feet high, presenting a variety\r\nof colours; and a short time afterwards there arose ten circles,\r\nwhich were black, white, and green, and which ultimately assumed\r\nthe form of a cone. A similar appearance had been observed in 1820.\r\nMore recently, in May 1855, a great stream of glowing lava, about\r\ntwo hundred feet in breadth, flowed towards a vast ravine nearly a\r\nthousand feet in depth. The first descent into this chasm is a\r\nsheer precipice, over which the lava dashed heavily, forming a\r\nmagnificent cascade of liquid fire.\r\n\r\nOf the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii no traces were\r\ndiscovered till the year 1713, when some labourers, in digging a\r\nwell, came upon the remains of Herculaneum about twenty-four feet\r\nunderground. Little attention, however, was paid to the discovery\r\nat that time; but in 1748 a peasant, digging in his vineyard,\r\nstumbled on some ancient works of art. On sinking a shaft at this\r\nspot to the depth of twelve feet, the remains of Pompeii were\r\nfound. This discovery led to further researches, and the exact\r\npositions of the two cities were erelong ascertained. The work of\r\ndisinterment has continued with little interruption from that to\r\nthe present time, and many valuable specimens of ancient art have\r\nbeen brought to light.\r\n\r\nThe greatest progress has been made at Pompeii; because the stuff,\r\nin which it was buried, is far looser than that which covers\r\nHerculaneum. In the former city, although it was anciently reckoned\r\nonly a third-rate place, there have already been discovered eight\r\ntemples, a forum, a basilica, two theatres, a magnificent\r\namphitheatre, and public baths. The ramparts, composed of huge\r\nblocks of stone, have also been exposed. One of the most remarkable\r\nplaces is the Cemetery. It consists of a broad path covered with\r\npavement, and bordered on either side with stately monuments,\r\nplaced over the tombs of the wealthy citizens of the place, and in\r\nwhich whole families have been interred.\r\n\r\nThe houses were found filled with elegant furniture, the walls of\r\nthe apartments adorned with beautiful paintings. Numerous statues,\r\nvases, lamps, and other elegant works of art, have been recovered.\r\nMany skeletons have also been found, in the exact positions in\r\nwhich the living men were caught by the deadly shower of\r\nsuffocating ashes. The excavators came upon the skeleton of a\r\nmiser, who had been attempting to escape from his house, and whose\r\nbony fingers were still clutching the purse which contained the\r\ntreasure he loved. There were also found in the barracks at Pompeii\r\nthe skeletons of two soldiers chained to the stocks; and the\r\nwritings scribbled by the soldiers on the walls are still quite\r\nlegible. In the vaults of a villa in the suburbs were discovered\r\nthe skeletons of seventeen persons, who had probably sought refuge\r\nthere, and been entombed. The stuff in which they were imbedded had\r\nbeen originally soft, but had become hardened through time. In this\r\nsubstance was found a cavity, containing the skeleton of a female\r\nwith an infant in her arms. Although nothing but the bones\r\nremained, the cavity contained a perfect cast of the woman's\r\nfigure--thus showing that she must have been imbedded in the\r\nsubstance while alive. Round the neck of this skeleton there was a\r\ngold chain, and on the fingers jewelled rings.\r\n\r\nIn many of the houses the names of the owners over the doors are\r\nstill legible, and the fresco-paintings on the inner walls are\r\nstill quite fresh and beautiful. The public fountains are adorned\r\nwith shells formed into patterns; and in the room of a painter\r\nthere was found a collection of shells in perfectly good order. A\r\nlarge quantity of fishing-nets was found in both the cities, and in\r\nHerculaneum some pieces of linen retaining its texture. There also\r\nwas discovered a fruiterer's shop, with vessels full of almonds,\r\nchestnuts, carubs, and walnuts. In another shop stood a glass\r\nvessel containing moist olives, and a jar with caviare--the\r\npreserved roe of the sturgeon. In the shop of an apothecary stood a\r\nbox that had contained pills, now reduced to powder, which had been\r\nprepared for a patient destined never to swallow them--a happy\r\ncircumstance for him, if he eventually escaped from the city. Very\r\nrecently there has been laid open a baker's shop, with the loaves\r\nof bread on the shelves, all ready for his customers, but doomed\r\nnever to be eaten. These loaves are of the same form as those still\r\nmade in that country, and on being analyzed were found to consist\r\nof the same ingredients as modern bread.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius rises rather abruptly from the plain on which it\r\nstands. The circuit of the base is about twelve miles, and the\r\nheight of the summit above the level of the sea about three\r\nthousand feet. This latter measurement, however, alters from time\r\nto time, owing to the variable height of the cone. Its moderate\r\nelevation, and the ease with which it may be approached, have\r\ninduced many travellers to ascend the mountain; and not a few have\r\nrecorded their experiences. So frequent are the eruptions of the\r\nvolcano, however, and so much do they change the aspect of the\r\ncrater, that any description remains correct for only a limited\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWithin the last hundred years the crater has been five times wholly\r\naltered, in consequence of its interior having been completely\r\nblown out, and its walls having crumbled down. When Sir William\r\nHamilton ascended the mountain in 1756, it had no less than three\r\ncraters and cones, one within another. The outermost was a very\r\nwide-mouthed cone. Within it rose centrically another, smaller in\r\nsize and narrower in the mouth; and within that again was the third\r\nand highest, having a smaller base and still narrower opening at\r\nthe top, whence the greatest volume of vapour ascended. In 1767\r\nthis innermost cone merged in the second, which was greatly\r\nenlarged; and by a subsequent eruption the interval between the\r\nfirst and second was obliterated, so that only a single cone\r\nremained. In 1822 the whole interior of the cone was blown out, and\r\nits walls crumbled down, so as to lower the height of the mountain\r\nseveral hundred feet. But within the vast gulf, nearly a mile in\r\ndiameter, which was thus left yawning open, there soon began to be\r\nformed a new cone, which showed itself erelong above the jagged\r\nedge of the crater. Eventually this cone increased, by the\r\naccumulation of ejected matters, to such an extent as to obliterate\r\nthe division between it and the rim of the former crater--thus once\r\nmore establishing a continuous cone. Since that time, the cone and\r\ncrater have twice undergone similar changes.\r\n\r\nThe most usual appearance of the crater, when in comparative\r\nrepose, is that of a vast circular or oval hollow basin, with\r\nnearly perpendicular walls, broken in their continuity, every here\r\nand there, by large projecting dykes, formed by the injection of\r\nmore recent lavas into fissures rent in those which had previously\r\nbecome consolidated. Below the perpendicular walls is a rapid\r\nslope, composed of fine ashes or sand, descending to the floor of\r\nthe crater, which is, for the most part, nearly flat. It is much\r\nrent by fissures, which during the night are seen to glow with a\r\nruddy glare, emanating from the hot materials beneath, and giving\r\nto the floor the appearance of being overspread with a fiery\r\ntissue, like a spider's web. From the bottom there usually rise one\r\nor two small craters of eruption, whence continually issue\r\nsulphurous fumes, and which, at pretty regular intervals, discharge\r\nshowers of stones heated to whiteness.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the cone is composed entirely of loose cinders,\r\nashes, and stones, so that the ascent is very laborious. The region\r\nof the mountain beneath the cone presents no difficulties, and that\r\npart of the ascent may be performed on donkeys or mules. The view\r\nfrom the top is magnificent. The contrast between the desolate\r\naspect of the interior of the crater, and the smiling prospect\r\nwhich may be seen from its edge, has been well compared to looking\r\nout of Tartarus into Paradise.\r\n\r\nNear Puzzuoli, in the Bay of Baiæ, and not far from Monte Nuovo,\r\nstand the ruins of the Temple of Serapis, so interesting to\r\ngeologists. These remains, consisting chiefly of the shafts of\r\nthree marble columns, still erect, though with a slight inclination\r\nsea-ward, afford distinct proofs, confirmed by other phenomena in\r\nthe neighbourhood, that, since the beginning of the Christian era,\r\nthe level of the coast in relation to that of the sea has changed\r\ntwice--the land having first sunk and been then raised again, each\r\ntime to the extent of upwards of 20 feet. The evidence of the\r\nsubmergence of the pillars consists mainly of a zone commencing at\r\nthe height of about 12 feet above their pedestals, and extending 9\r\nfeet upwards, in which are numerous perforations, made by a marine\r\nbivalve mollusc. The upraising again of the ground on which the\r\ntemple stands, to nearly its original height, appears to have\r\noccurred about the time of the formation of Monte Nuovo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMount Etna--Its Appearance and Height-Ancient Eruptions-Pindar's\r\nAllusion--Virgil's Description--Subordinate Cones and\r\nCraters--Caverns--Val del Bove--Formation of Monti Rossi--Eruption\r\nof 1852--Whirlwinds--Lava Torrents--Cascades of Lava--Description\r\nof Crater --Empedocles--Enceladus--Craters of 1865-Cyclopean\r\nIsles--Homer's Legend-Volcanic Origin--Other Basaltic Groups\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Etna may well be called the Queen of European Volcanoes, so\r\nmajestic does she look, with her lofty summit glistening in the\r\nsunbeams white with snow, yet pouring forth volumes of vapour. This\r\nmountain, as you will observe from the annexed woodcut, is\r\naltogether more massive in its appearance than Vesuvius. It is\r\nabout three times higher, rising to nearly eleven thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and it has a circuit of about\r\neighty-seven miles at its base.\r\n\r\nEtna has been a volcano from time immemorial; but of its more\r\nancient eruptions only vague traditions have survived. The Greek\r\npoet Pindar is the earliest writer who makes mention of its\r\nactivity. He refers to it in his first Pythian Ode, Strophe B, 1.\r\n1. The passage is thus rendered by Carey--\r\n\r\n     \"From whose caverned depths aspire,\r\n      In purest folds upwreathing, tost\r\n      Fountains of approachless fire--\r\n      by day a flood of smouldering smoke\r\n      With sullen gleam the torrents pour\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Mount Etna.]\r\n\r\nThe ode in which this allusion occurs is said to have been written\r\nabout B.C. 470; and the eruption to which it refers probably took\r\nplace shortly before that date.\r\n\r\nVirgil also describes the mountain very forcibly in the Æneid,\r\nlib. iii. 570. Dryden renders the passage thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"The port capacious, and secure from wind,\r\n      Is to the foot of thund'ring Etna joined.\r\n      By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high:\r\n      By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,\r\n      And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.\r\n      Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,\r\n      And shivered by the force come piece-meal down.\r\n      Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,\r\n      Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.\"\r\n\r\nSince the one to which Pindar alludes, there have been recorded\r\nabout sixty eruptions; but in the present century Etna has been\r\nless frequently active than Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great height of Mount Etna, the lava seldom rises so\r\nfar as to flow from the summit. It more frequently bursts forth\r\nfrom the flanks of the mountain; and in this manner there have been\r\nformed numerous smaller cones, of which several have craters of\r\ntheir own. Hence Etna is rather a group of volcanoes than a single\r\ncone; but all these subordinate volcanic hills cluster round the\r\nflanks of the great central summit. Etna may thus be regarded as a\r\nfertile mother of mountains, with all her children around her. Some\r\nof these hills, her offspring, are covered with forests and rich\r\nvegetation--such having enjoyed a lasting repose. Others are still\r\narid and bare, having been more recently formed. Owing to this\r\npeculiarity in its structure, Etna does not present that conical\r\naspect which characterizes most other volcanoes. Strange as it may\r\nseem, there are, on the sides of the mountain, caverns which the\r\nSicilians use for storing ice. Some of these caverns are of vast\r\nextent. One called Fossa della Palomba measures, at its entrance,\r\n625 feet in circumference, and has a depth of about 78 feet. This\r\ngreat cavity, however, forms merely the vestibule to a series of\r\nothers, which are perfectly dark.\r\n\r\nAnother striking feature of Mount Etna is the Val del Bove. It is a\r\ndeep valley, presenting, when viewed from above, somewhat of the\r\nappearance of an amphitheatre, It stretches from near the summit\r\ndown to the upper limit of the wooded region of the mountain, and\r\nhas a remarkably desolate aspect--presenting a vast expanse of bare\r\nand rugged lava.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous eruptions of Etna, one of the most memorable was\r\nthat of 1669, when on the flank of the mountain above Nicolosi,\r\nabout half way between Catania and the top of the great crater,\r\nthere was formed an immense rent about twelve miles long, from\r\nwhich a vast torrent of lava descended. After flowing for several\r\nmiles, and destroying a part of Catania in its course, it entered\r\nthe sea, and formed a small promontory, which has since proved very\r\nuseful as a breakwater. But besides this stream, there were at the\r\nsame time thrown up such immense quantities of ashes, cinders,\r\nstones, and other matters, that they formed two conical hills, more\r\nthan three hundred feet in height above the slope of the mountain\r\nfrom which they rose, and measuring nearly two miles in\r\ncircumference at their base. These hills were named Monti Rossi.\r\n\r\nMount Etna was in activity as lately as 1865; but a previous\r\neruption in 1852 was of greater violence. It began, as usual, with\r\nhollow underground rumblings, and the ascent of dense columns of\r\nvapour, mingled with dust and ashes, high into the air. These were\r\nspeedily whirled into enormous eddies by fierce whirlwinds. Two new\r\nmouths were formed on the side of the mountain, and these vomited\r\nforth immense streams of lava, which rushed with the vehemence of a\r\ntorrent down the steep. The violence of the commotion increasing,\r\nthe two mouths were, by the crumbling of the intervening rocks,\r\nblended into one, and then huge fragments of the broken rock were\r\nhurled to a great height, along with vast quantities of hot stones,\r\ncinders, and black sand. Increasing quantities of lava were now\r\npoured from the greatly enlarged opening, and these formed on the\r\nplains below a great river of liquid fire, nearly two miles in\r\nbreadth, and between seven and eight feet in depth, which advanced\r\nat the rate of upwards of a hundred feet in an hour, carrying\r\nbefore it devastation and ruin. Its course being through a highly\r\ncultivated country, the damage it inflicted was immense. This\r\neruption continued for several months, with only short intervals of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Crater of Etna.]\r\n\r\nIt has more than once happened, that the lava-streams of Etna, in\r\ntheir descent from the crater of eruption, have come to a\r\nprecipitous wall of rock, over which they have plunged in a cascade\r\nsimilar to that formed by the lava of Vesuvius in 1855, but on a\r\nless magnificent scale, as respects the height of the fall. One of\r\nthese occasions was during the eruption of 1771, and another during\r\nthat of 1819.\r\n\r\nThe principal cone of Mount Etna was ascended in 1834 by Messrs.\r\nElie de Beaumont and Leopold von Buch. The former describes what\r\nthey saw in the following terms:--\"It was to us a moment of\r\nsurprise difficult to describe, when we found ourselves\r\nunexpectedly on the margin--not, indeed, of the great crater--but\r\nof an almost circular gulf, nearly three hundred feet in diameter,\r\nwhich does not touch the great crater save at a small part of its\r\ncircumference. We peered eagerly into this nearly cylindrical\r\nfunnel; but vain was our search into the secret of its volcanic\r\naction. From the almost horizontal tops of the nearly vertical\r\nsteeps, nothing can be descried but the upper cone. On trying to\r\nreckon those one below another, vision becomes gradually lost in\r\nthe perfect darkness beneath. No sound issues from this darkness.\r\nThere are only exhaled slightly sulphurous white vapours, chiefly\r\nsteam. The dismal aspect of this black and silent gulf, in which\r\nour view was lost--its dark moist sides, along which crept, in a\r\nlanguid and monotonous manner, long flakes of vapour of a sombre\r\ngray--the great crater to which this narrow gulf is attached, with\r\nits confused heap of diverse substances, coloured yellow, gray,\r\nred, like the image of chaos--all presented around us an aspect\r\nquite funereal and sepulchral.\"\r\n\r\nThe French geologist, in having escaped from his visit to the\r\ncrater with nothing worse than a fit of the vapours, came off\r\nbetter than Empedocles, the Sicilian philosopher, in the days of\r\nold: for, as the story goes, this inquisitive sage, being very\r\nanxious to have a peep into the crater, and venturing too near,\r\ntoppled in altogether, and nothing more was seen of him, except one\r\nof his sandals, which was vomited up by the volcano--thus conveying\r\nto his friends an intimation of the manner of his death.\r\n\r\nSome incredulous persons allege that this story has no better\r\nfoundation than the fable of the poets, that the giant Enceladus,\r\nson of Titan and Terra, having offended Jupiter, the infuriated god\r\nfirst felled him with a thunderbolt, and then put Mount Etna as a\r\nsort of extinguisher on the top of him--his restlessness underneath\r\nfully accounting for all the commotions of the mountain.\r\n\r\nSoon after the eruption which took place towards the end of January\r\n1865, the craters then opened were visited by M. Fouqué, a French\r\ngeologist. At the time of his visit, 10th March, they were seven in\r\nnumber, and he thus describes their modes of action:--\r\n\r\n\"The three upper craters produced two or three times a minute,\r\npowerful detonations like thunderclaps. The lower craters, on the\r\ncontrary, incessantly gave forth a succession of reports too rapid\r\nto be reckoned. These sounds, although unremitting, were clear and\r\ndistinct, the one from the other. I can find no better comparison\r\nfor them than the strokes of a hammer falling on an anvil. Had the\r\nancients heard a similar noise, I can readily conceive whence arose\r\nthe idea of their imagining a forge in the centre of Etna, with the\r\nCyclops for workmen.\"\r\n\r\nOff the eastern coast of Sicily, and not far from Mount Etna, lie\r\nthe Cyclopean Isles, of one of which the annexed woodcut gives a\r\nrepresentation. You will observe what a singular appearance it\r\npresents, with its rows of basaltic columns piled one above\r\nanother. The other isle is close by, and there is an ancient\r\ntradition that they at one time formed part of the mainland of\r\nSicily. Homer has a curious story about the manner in which they\r\nbecame detached. The passage occurs towards the end of the ninth\r\nbook of the Odyssey. He tells that, at the time Ulysses visited\r\nSicily, it was inhabited by the Cyclops, who, as already mentioned,\r\nwere said to have had each only one eye, situated in his forehead.\r\nTheir king's name was Polyphemus, a huge giant who beguiled Ulysses\r\nand a portion of his crew into a cave, where he killed some of the\r\ncrew and devoured them for his supper. Ulysses, fearing his turn\r\nmight come next, persuaded Polyphemus to taste some strong wine he\r\nhad with him, and filled him so tipsy that he fell fast asleep.\r\nWhile he was in this state, Ulysses burnt out his one eye with a\r\nred-hot iron. The giant awoke in agony, but Ulysses contrived to\r\nescape from his clutches, and, after getting into his ship, began\r\ntaunting and jeering the monster. Thereupon Homer says:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Cyclopean Isle]\r\n\r\n     \"These words the Cyclops' burning rage provoke:\r\n      From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock;\r\n      High o'er the billows flew the massy load,\r\n      And near the ship came thund'ring on the flood.\r\n      It almost brushed the helm, and fell before:\r\n      The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore.\"\r\n\r\n                                     Pope's _translation_.\r\n\r\nThe huge missile having thus missed its mark, Ulysses, with great\r\nimpudence, renewed his jeers, taunting the giant, and telling him\r\nwho it was that had poked out his eye; whereupon Polyphemus invokes\r\nthe vengeance of Neptune upon him, and--\r\n\r\n     \"A larger rock then heaving from the plain,\r\n      He whirled it round--it rung across the main:\r\n      It fell and brushed the stern: the billows roar,\r\n      Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore.\"\r\n\r\n                                     Pope's _translation_.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of which the Cyclopean Isles are composed are entirely of\r\nvolcanic origin, and it is far from improbable that they may have\r\nat one time been attached to Sicily, and severed from it by some\r\ngreat volcanic convulsion. A careful examination of these large\r\npiles of basaltic columns led Dr. Daubeny to the conclusion, that\r\nthe lavas from which they have been formed were consolidated under\r\ngreat pressure, and probably at the bottom of the sea, whence they\r\nhave been afterwards upheaved. He also concludes, from certain\r\nappearances, that the two islands were at one time united.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclopean Isles strongly resemble, in their general aspect, the\r\nwell-known Giant's Causeway on the northern coast of Ireland, and\r\nthe Isle of Staffa off the western coast of Scotland. The latter,\r\nwhich, around its whole sea-girt outline, presents ranges of\r\nbasaltic columns, some of them disposed in curious fantastic\r\ngroups, most nearly resembles the Sicilian pair. These differ from\r\nit chiefly in their having the columns piled in terraces, one above\r\nanother. Staffa, however, can boast of a far more striking feature\r\n--the celebrated Cave of Fingal--its stately basaltic columns\r\ninspiring every beholder with admiration, not unmixed with awe,\r\nwhile its brightly-tinted floor rivals in brilliancy of colouring\r\nthe most beautiful mosaics.\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Iceland, also, there are some remarkable ranges of\r\nbasaltic columns. One in particular, named the Ruins of\r\nDverghamrar, is in the form of a semicircle skirting the sea-coast.\r\nAnother group, still more wonderful, forms a curious natural Gothic\r\narch, surmounted by pinnacles. It is so picturesque that an\r\narchitect might study it with advantage, and derive from it\r\nvaluable hints in designing the entrance to a cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLipan Islands--Stromboli--Origin of Name--Position of\r\nCrater--Description of Crater--New Volcanic Island named\r\nJulia--Phenomena preceding its Elevation--Description of Island\r\nand Crater--Its Disappearance--Rise of Islands at Santorin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lipari Islands are all of volcanic origin. The most interesting\r\namong them, for the length of time it has been in action and the\r\nconstancy of its activity, is Stromboli. This name is a corruption\r\nof the ancient Greek name Στρογγυλη which was given to it\r\nbecause of its round swelling form. This is a very fussy little\r\nvolcano, for it keeps perpetually puffing, growling, and fuming. It\r\nthrows out columns of steam, and at intervals stones, cinders, and\r\nashes, which are for the most part drifted by the wind into the\r\nsea. This restless volcano has been in almost uninterrupted\r\nactivity since at least the third century before the Christian era\r\n--however much further back.\r\n\r\nSeveral enterprising travellers have ascended to the crater of\r\nStromboli. It was examined with great care in 1828 by M. Hoffmann,\r\na celebrated Prussian geologist, who, while being held fast by his\r\ncompanions, leant over the crag immediately above the crater, and\r\nlooked right down into one of its active mouths. He thus describes\r\nwhat he saw:--\r\n\r\n\"Three active mouths were seen at the bottom of the crater. The\r\nprincipal one, in the middle, was about two hundred feet in\r\ndiameter; it shows nothing remarkable, only fuming slightly; and\r\nnumerous yellow incrustations of sulphur coat the walls of its\r\nchimney. Close by this mouth is another, somewhat nearer the\r\nprecipice, only twenty feet wide, in which I could observe the play\r\nof the column of liquid lava, which at intervals poised itself at a\r\nlevel. This lava did not look like a burning mass vomiting flames,\r\nbut as glossy as molten metal--like iron issuing from the smelting\r\nfurnace, or silver at the bottom of a crucible.\r\n\r\n\"This melted mass rose and fell--evidently urged by the powerful\r\ntension of elastic vapours pressing it upwards from beneath; and it\r\nwas easy to perceive the balance of effect between the weight of\r\nthe molten masses and the pressure of the steam which resisted\r\nthem. The surface rose and fell rhythmically: there was heard a\r\npeculiar sound, like the crackling of air from bellows entering the\r\ndoor of a furnace. A bubble of white vapour issued at each crack,\r\nraising the lava, which fell down again immediately after its\r\nescape. These bubbles of vapour dragged to the surface of the lava\r\nred-hot cinders, which danced as if tossed by invisible hands in\r\nrhythmic sport above the brink of the opening.\r\n\r\n\"This play, so regular and attractive, was interrupted, every\r\nquarter of an hour or so, by more tumultuous movements. The mass of\r\nwhirling vapour then rested motionless for a moment--even making a\r\njerking motion of return, as if inhaled by the crater, from the\r\nbottom of which the lava rose more strongly as if to encounter it.\r\nThen the ground trembles, and the walls of the crater starting\r\nbend. It was quite an earthquake. The mouth of the crater uttered a\r\nloud rolling bellow, which was followed by an immense bubble of\r\nvapour, bursting at the surface of the lava with a loud thundering\r\nreport. The whole surface of the lava, reduced to glowing\r\nsplinters, was then tossed into the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Julia, or Graham's Island, in August 1831.]\r\n\r\n\"The heat struck our faces forcibly; while a flaming sheaf rose\r\nright into the air, and fell back in a shower of fire all around.\r\nSome bombs ascended to a height of about 1200 feet, and in passing\r\nover our heads described parabolas of fire. Immediately after such\r\nan eruption, the lava withdrew to the bottom of the chimney, which\r\nthen yawned black and gaping. But erelong there was seen re-ascending\r\nthe shining mirror of the surface of lava, which then\r\nrecommenced the rhythmic play of its ordinary less violent\r\nbubblings.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an agreeable visit this must have been! Don't you think,\r\nbetween ourselves, that the German philosopher must, on this\r\noccasion, have greatly resembled an Irishman in love, seeing he was\r\nso eager to reach the mouth of the _crater?_\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the description of other existing volcanoes,\r\nit may entertain you to hear something about Julia. This\r\ninteresting _crater_ had a short and troubled existence. She\r\nwas not born like others of her name, but rose suddenly and\r\nmajestically out of the sea, as the poets feign that Venus did of\r\nold. She did not, however, keep her head long above water, but\r\nafter raging and fuming for about a couple of months, she plunged\r\nagain under the waves. This happened in the year 1831.\r\n\r\nOn page 57 is a picture showing you how she looked in August of\r\nthat year, about a month after she made her appearance. You see\r\nwhat a fury of a _crater_ she must have been. It was a French\r\nphilosopher (Constant Prévost) who christened her Julia; but it is\r\nhard to divine what prompted him to act so ungallantly. Perhaps, at\r\nthe moment, he may have had in his eye some Julia of his\r\nacquaintance, with very red hair and a very fiery temper.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic island rose out of the Mediterranean, about midway\r\nbetween the Island of Pantellaria and the village of Sciacca on the\r\nsouthern coast of Sicily. From about the 28th of June to the 2nd of\r\nJuly 1831, the inhabitants of Sciacca felt several slight shocks,\r\nwhich they imagined to have proceeded from Etna. On the 8th of July\r\nthe crew of a Sicilian ship, which was sailing at a distance of\r\nabout six miles from Sciacca, suddenly observed in the sea a jet of\r\nwater about 100 feet high. It rose into the air with a thundering\r\nnoise, sustained itself for about ten minutes, and then fell down.\r\nSimilar jets continued to rise in succession, at intervals of about\r\na quarter of an hour, and produced a thick mist overspreading the\r\nsurface of the sea, which was much agitated and covered with a\r\nreddish scum. Shoals of dead fishes were drifted on the waves. On\r\nthe third day the jets were between 800 and 900 feet in diameter,\r\nand between 60 and 70 feet in height, while the steam from them\r\nrose to nearly 1800 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July the inhabitants of Sciacca had their nostrils\r\nassailed by a strong smell of sulphur, and beheld the surface of\r\nthe sea covered with black porous cinders, which, being drifted\r\nashore, formed a bed of some thickness on the beach. So great was\r\nthe drift of volcanic ashes, that boats could hardly struggle\r\nthrough the water, and multitudes of dead fishes floated on its\r\nsurface. Next morning they saw rising out of the sea a column of\r\ndark vapour, which, however, towards night became lurid red. From\r\ntime to time, during both the day and night, they heard loud\r\nreports, and saw bright sparks of fire through the dusky vapour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Julia, or Graham's Island, on 29th September 1831.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of July the captain of the Sicilian ship discovered\r\nthat an island had arisen out of the sea at the spot whence the\r\nappearances before described had proceeded. It had already attained\r\na height of nearly twelve feet, and had in its centre a crater,\r\nwhich vomited forth immense jets of steam, along with ashes,\r\ncinders, stones, &c. The water which boiled in this crater was\r\nreddish, and the cinders, which covered the sea all round the\r\nisland, were of a chocolate colour. The island subsequently\r\nattained a height of upwards of 90 feet at its highest point, and a\r\ncircumference of about three-quarters of a mile. A channel of\r\ncommunication was also opened between the sea and the interior of\r\nthe crater, which had a diameter of about 650 feet. The vapours and\r\nother matters thrown up from the mouth of the volcano formed a\r\nluminous column upwards of 200 feet in height.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of September it was visited by the French gentleman who\r\ngave it the name of Julia, and it then presented the appearance\r\nwhich we have sketched. He landed with a party and proceeded to\r\nexamine the crater, in which he found a circular basin filled with\r\nreddish water, almost boiling hot, and fresh. This basin was nearly\r\n200 feet in diameter. There rose from the water bubbles of gas,\r\nwhich made it appear as if it were boiling. The water was not quite\r\nat the boiling point, however, yet the bubbles of gas were\r\nsufficiently hot to burn the fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Crater of Julia, or Graham's Island.]\r\n\r\nThese bubbles rose from a great depth, and each, on bursting, which\r\nit did with a feeble report, threw out sand and cinders. At a short\r\ndistance from the crater there rose sulphurous vapours, which\r\ndeposited sulphur and salt. The loose dust and ashes forming the\r\nsoil of the island were hot, and walking on them was difficult. The\r\nforegoing woodcut will give you an idea of the appearance which the\r\ncrater presented to those visitors.\r\n\r\nIn the following month of October nothing remained of this\r\nwonderful island but a hillock of sand and cinders; and at the end\r\nof six months it had quite vanished. Soundings taken a few years\r\nago show ten feet of water over the spot, so that, although the\r\nisland has disappeared, there is still a shoal left behind. This\r\ntemporary volcano is best known in England under the name of\r\nGraham's Island; so called after an English naval officer of that\r\nname, who was the first to set foot on it, and who planted upon it\r\nthe English flag, so claiming it for his sovereign. The Sicilians\r\nallege this to be the reason why it disappeared so soon--that it\r\nwas in a hurry to escape from under the English yoke.\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena have been taking place during the past year,\r\n1866, in the Bay of Santorin, situated in the island of that name,\r\nwhich lies to the northward of Crete. There are several islands in\r\nthe bay, all apparently of volcanic origin, and one of them was\r\nthrown up about three centuries before the beginning of the\r\nChristian era. Last year their number was increased by a series of\r\neruptions similar in their attendant circumstances to those which\r\naccompanied the upheaval of Julia. The first warnings were given on\r\nthe 30th of January 1866, by low underground rumblings, and slight\r\nmovements of the ground at the south end of New Kammeni, one of the\r\nformerly upheaved islands in the bay. Next day these phenomena\r\nincreased in violence, and quantities of gas bubbled up from the\r\nsea. On the 1st of February, reddish flames ascended from the\r\nwater, and on the 2nd there rose, out of the harbour of Voulcano,\r\nan island, which was christened \"George.\" The volcanic agitation\r\nwas prolonged during February and March--the upheaval of other two\r\nislands being the result. Whether these additional islands will\r\ncontinue permanently above water remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPeak of Teneriffe--Its Crater--Eruption of Chahorra--Palma--Great\r\nCaldera--Lancerote--Great Eruption--Sudden Death--Fuego, Cape de\r\nVerde Islands--Cotopaxi--Its Appearance--Great Eruptive\r\nForce--Tunguragua--Great Eruption of Mud and Water--Fish thrown\r\nout--Quito--Its Overthrow--Pichinca--Humboldt's Ascent--Narrow\r\nEscape--Antisana--Sangay--Rancagua--Chillan--Masaya\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Island of Teneriffe is celebrated for its magnificent snow-clad\r\npeak. On referring to the woodcut of this volcano at page 11, you\r\nwill observe in what a sharp point the cone terminates, and how\r\nslender is the column of vapour at its summit. The crater at the\r\ntop is comparatively small--its greatest diameter being 300, and\r\nits smallest 200 feet, while its depth is only about 100 feet. From\r\nthis crater there has been no eruption since 1706, when the finest\r\nharbour in the island was destroyed. But from the side of the peak\r\nthere rises a supplementary mountain named Chahorra, on the top of\r\nwhich there is also a crater, whence there was an eruption in 1798.\r\nSo great was its violence, that masses of rock were thrown to a\r\nheight of upwards of 3000 feet. In the neighbouring island of Palma\r\nthere is a volcanic crater named the Great Caldera, whose depth is\r\nsaid to be upwards of 5000 feet.\r\n\r\nAlmost due east of Palma, and much nearer the African coast, lies\r\nthe Island of Lancerote, on which are a great many volcanic cones,\r\narranged nearly in a straight line. These were for the most part\r\nformed by a long series of eruptions which took place during the\r\nyears from 1730 to 1736. Such immense quantities of lava were\r\npoured forth in the course of those six years, that about a third\r\nof the surface of the island was covered by them, and many towns\r\nand villages were destroyed. St. Catalina, a populous and thriving\r\ntown, was first overflowed by a lava-stream, and then a new crater\r\nburst forth on its very site, raising over it a hill 400 feet high.\r\nAll the cattle in the island fell down dead in one day, and nearly\r\nabout the same time--they were suffocated by deadly vapours that\r\nrose from the ground. The volcanic activity of this island was\r\nrenewed in August 1824, when there was formed, near the port of\r\nRescif, a new crater, which vomited forth such quantities of\r\nstones, ashes, and other volcanic matters, that in the short space\r\nof twenty-four hours they formed a hill of considerable height.\r\n\r\nThe Cape de Verde Islands, lying to the south-westward of the\r\nCanaries, are also volcanic. In 1847 a volcano named Fuego,\r\nsituated in one of them, after remaining at rest about fifty years,\r\nburst into fresh activity. No less than seven new vents were\r\nformed; and from these were poured forth great streams of lava,\r\nwhich wrought immense damage in the cultivated parts of the island.\r\nThe inhabitants sustained great loss by the destruction of their\r\ncattle and crops.\r\n\r\nPassing over to the South American continent, we come to the range\r\nof the Andes, which contains numerous volcanoes. Among these the\r\nmost conspicuous is Cotopaxi, the highest volcano in the world,\r\nsituated in the territory of Quito. So perfect is the form of the\r\ncone, that it looks as if it had been turned in a lathe. Its\r\ncoating of snow gives it a dazzling appearance, and so sharply is\r\nthe snow-line defined that it seems almost as if the volcano-king\r\nwore a white night-cap instead of a crown.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of this mountain are rare. One of the greatest of\r\nthem lasted for three years, and desolated an immense extent of\r\ncountry with floods of lava. On this occasion, it is said, columns\r\nof fire rose to the height of nearly 5000 feet, so great was the\r\nenergy of the volcanic force.\r\n\r\nA little to the southward of Cotopaxi, but concealed from it by the\r\nintervening mass of Chimborazo, lies the volcano of Tunguragua,\r\nfrom which there was an extraordinary eruption in the year 1797,\r\nthat proved very destructive to the cities in its neighbourhood.\r\nIndeed, so terrible was the convulsion of the ground, which lasted\r\nfour minutes, that the cities of Riobamba and Quero were reduced to\r\nheaps of ruins. Then the base of Tunguragua was rent, and from\r\nnumerous apertures there were poured out streams of water and mud,\r\nthe latter gathering in the valleys to the depth of 600 feet. This\r\nmud spread itself far and wide, blocking up the channels of rivers,\r\nand forming lakes, which remained upwards of two months. But,\r\nstrangest of all, quantities of dead fishes were found in the water\r\nwhich burst from the volcano. These fishes are supposed to have\r\nbeen bred in subterranean lakes contained in caverns in the\r\ninterior of the mountain, considerably removed from the volcanic\r\nfires in the centre. It is probable that, when the rent was formed\r\nnear the base, one of those caverns was broken open, and that the\r\nwaters from it were discharged along with their finny inhabitants.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of one of those fishes, which was taken by Baron\r\nHumboldt. When you see what a queer-looking fish it is, you will\r\nwonder the less at its having chosen so strange an abode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Pimelodus Cyclopum]\r\n\r\nQuito, the capital of the province of that name, is the highest of\r\ncities--being situated at an elevation of between nine and ten\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea. It is built on a plain,\r\nlying on the flanks of the volcano Pichinca, of which a view is\r\ngiven in the annexed woodcut. Poor Quito has suffered severely from\r\nthis dangerous neighbourhood; for, on the 22nd of March 1859, a\r\nviolent shaking of the mountain laid the whole city in ruins.\r\n\r\nPichinca, you will observe, has a most irregular outline, but very\r\ngraceful withal. Instead of a single cone like Cotopaxi, it has a\r\ngroup of cones, some of which are very pointed. It has four\r\nprincipal summits, of which the most southerly contains the active\r\ncrater. Here the celebrated traveller Baron Humboldt nearly lost\r\nhis life. Having ascended the cone and approached the edge of the\r\ncrater, he peered into the depths of the dark abyss, and there\r\nbeheld the glowing lava boiling as if in a huge caldron. A thick\r\nmist coming on, he unwarily advanced to within a few feet of the\r\nrapid slope descending into the crater, and was within an ace of\r\ntoppling over into the fiery gulf beneath. What a pity it would\r\nhave been had he fallen in! We should have had no \"Personal\r\nNarrative,\" no \"Cosmos.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Pichinca]\r\n\r\nThere are in this region of South America other two great\r\nvolcanoes, named Antisana and Sangay. The former has not been in\r\naction since 1718, but is remarkable for the immense beds of lava\r\nwhich it has amassed around it during its former eruptions. Sangay,\r\nagain, has ever since 1728 been in a state of almost perpetual\r\nactivity--in this respect resembling Stromboli, which, however, it\r\nfar exceeds in height, its summit being nearly 18,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. The eruptions of this mountain are\r\naccompanied by loud explosions, which are heard at great distances,\r\nand they succeed each other with immense rapidity. The fumes\r\nemitted are sometimes gray, sometimes orange; and the matters\r\nejected are cinders, dross, and spherical masses of stone. These\r\nlast are often two feet in diameter, and in strong explosions as\r\nmany as sixty of them may be thrown out at a time. They are glowing\r\nat a white heat, and for the most part they fall back into the vent\r\nof the crater. Sometimes, however, they alight on the edge of the\r\ncone--imparting to it a temporary brilliancy; but the mass of the\r\ncone, being composed of loose black cinders, has a most dismal\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nAnother very active South American volcano is Rancagua in Chili. It\r\nis, however, of moderate height, and thus in its general character\r\nresembles Stromboli, which it rivals in restlessness. Another of\r\nthe volcanoes of Chili, named Chillan, which had long been in a\r\nstate of repose, renewed its activity in November 1864. Its usually\r\nsnow-clad summit became covered in a short time with a thick layer\r\nof volcanic ashes, which greatly altered its appearance. Streams of\r\nlava were also thrown out by the mountain on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThere are several volcanoes in Central America. One of them, named\r\nMasaya, was very active during the sixteenth century. It is\r\nsituated near the lake of Nicaragua, in the territory of that name.\r\nIt was visited in 1529 by the Spanish historian Gonzales Fernando\r\nde Oviedo, from whose description it seems to have presented\r\nphenomena resembling those seen in the crater of Stromboli. \"In its\r\nordinary state,\" he says, \"the surface of the lava, in the midst of\r\nwhich black scoriae are continually floating, remains several\r\nhundred feet below the edges of the water. But sometimes there is\r\nsuddenly produced an ebullition so violent, that the lava rises\r\nalmost to the very brim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nJorullo--Great Monument--Jorullo's Estate--Interruption to his\r\nQuiet--His Estate Swells--Swallows Two Rivers--Throws up\r\nOvens--Becomes a Burning Mountain--Popocatepetl--Spanish\r\nAscents--Orizaba --Muller's Ascent--Morne-Garou--Pelée---La\r\nSoufriere\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a fortunate man was Mr. Jorullo! Old Cheops, king of Egypt,\r\nspent vast sums of money, many long years, and the labour of\r\nmyriads of his subjects, in erecting the Great Pyramid as a\r\nmonument to his memory. But Mr. Jorullo, without his having to lay\r\ndown a single Mexican dollar, and without any labour, either of his\r\nown or of his servants, had a magnificent monument raised to his\r\nmemory in a single night. Jorullo's monument, too, is far bigger\r\nthan the pyramid of Cheops--being nearly four times the height, and\r\noccupying a much larger extent of ground. Whether it will last as\r\nlong as the pyramid has done, time only can show.\r\n\r\nYou would doubtless like to know how this great monument was\r\nreared. Here is the story:--Don Pedro di Jorullo was a Mexican\r\ngentleman who lived about the middle of the last century. He was a\r\nlanded proprietor--the owner of a nice little farm of great\r\nfertility, situated to the westward of the city of Mexico, and\r\nabout ninety miles from the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The ground\r\nwas well watered by artificial means, and produced abundant crops\r\nof indigo and sugar-cane. Thus Mr. Jorullo was a very thriving\r\nwell-to-do sort of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Jorullo]\r\n\r\nThis gentleman's prosperity continued without interruption till the\r\nmonth of June 1759, when, to the great alarm of his servants\r\ndwelling on the estate, strange underground rumblings were heard,\r\naccompanied by frequent shakings of the ground. These continued for\r\nnearly two months; but at the end of that time all became quiet\r\nagain, and Mr. Jorullo's servants slept in fancied security. On the\r\nnight of the 28th of September, however, their slumbers were\r\nsuddenly broken by a return of the horrible underground\r\nrumblings--thundering more loudly than before. The next night, these\r\nsubterranean thunders became so loud, that the Indian servants\r\nstarted from their beds, and fled in terror to the mountains in the\r\nneighbourhood. Gazing thence, after day had dawned, they beheld to\r\ntheir astonishment that a tract of ground from three to four square\r\nmiles in extent, with their master's farm in the middle of it, had\r\nbeen upheaved in the shape of an inflated bladder. At the edges\r\nthis singular elevation rises only about thirty-nine feet above the\r\nold level of the plain; but so great is the general convexity of\r\nthe mound, that towards the centre it swells up to five hundred and\r\ntwenty-four feet above the original level.\r\n\r\nThe Indians affirmed that they saw flames issue from the ground\r\nthroughout an extent of more than half a square league, while\r\nfragments of burning rocks were thrown to enormous heights. Thick\r\nclouds of ashes rose into the air, illuminated by glowing fires\r\nbeneath; and the surface of the ground seemed to swell into\r\nbillows, like those of a tempestuous sea. Into the vast burning\r\nchasms, whence these ejections were thrown, two rivers plunged in\r\ncataracts; but the water only increased the violence of the\r\neruption. It was thrown into steam with explosive force, and great\r\nquantities of mud and balls of basalt were ejected. On the surface\r\nof the swollen mound there were formed thousands of small cones,\r\nfrom six to ten feet in height, and sending forth steam to heights\r\nvarying from twenty to thirty feet.\r\n\r\nOut of a chasm in the midst of these cones, or ovens, as the\r\nnatives call them, there rose six large masses, the highest of\r\nwhich is sixteen hundred feet in height, and constitutes the\r\nvolcano of Jorullo. The eruptions of this central volcano continued\r\ntill February 1760 with extreme violence--the crater throwing out\r\nlarge quantities of lava; but in the succeeding years it became\r\nless turbulent in its activity. It still, however, continues to\r\nburn; and the mountain emits from the wide crater at its summit\r\nseveral jets of vapour. The foregoing woodcut gives a view of this\r\nvolcano, and of the little steaming ovens which stud the whole\r\nground around it, giving it at a distance the appearance of the sea\r\nin a storm. And now confess that Mr. Jorullo's monument is far\r\ngrander than the pyramid of Cheops. Surely the loss of his farm was\r\namply compensated to him, by the perpetuation of his memory and his\r\nname, through the rearing of such a marvellous cenotaph.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the first eruption, the ground for a great\r\ndistance round the volcano was too hot to be habitable or capable\r\nof cultivation. It is now, however, so much cooled down, that it is\r\nonce more covered with vegetation; and even some small portions of\r\nthe raised ground containing the ovens have been again brought\r\nunder culture.\r\n\r\nBesides this volcano, so recent in its origin, Mexico contains\r\nother five--Orizaba, Toluca, Tuxtla, Popocatepetl, and Colima. What\r\nis rather remarkable, these five, together with Jorullo, all lie\r\nnearly in a straight line running east and west. The tracts of\r\ncountry which these volcanoes have desolated with their lavas are\r\ncalled by the Mexicans the \"Malpays.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these mountains is Popocatepetl. Although it\r\nhas long remained in comparative quiet, it was very active at the\r\ntime of the Spanish invasion under Cortés. Of the first approach of\r\nthe Spaniards to this volcano, and of the attempts made by some of\r\nthem to climb to the top, Mr. Prescott, in his history of the\r\nconquest of Mexico, gives the following graphic account:--\r\n\r\n\"They were passing between two of the highest mountains on the\r\nNorth American continent, Popocatepetl, 'the hill that smokes' and\r\nIztaccihuatl, or 'white woman;' a name suggested, doubtless, by the\r\nbright robe of snow spread over its broad and broken surface. A\r\npuerile superstition of the Indians regarded these celebrated\r\nmountains as gods, and Iztaccihuatl as the wife of her more\r\nformidable neighbour. A tradition of a higher character described\r\nthe northern volcano as the abode of the departed spirits of wicked\r\nrulers, whose fiery agonies in their prison-house caused the\r\nfearful bellowings and convulsions in times of eruption. It was the\r\nclassic fable of antiquity. These superstitious legends had\r\ninvested the mountain with a mysterious horror, that made the\r\nnatives shrink from attempting its ascent, which, indeed, was, from\r\nnatural causes, a work of incredible difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"The great _volcan_, as Popocatepetl was called, rose to the\r\nenormous height of 17,852 feet above the level of the sea; more\r\nthan 2000 feet above the 'monarch of mountains'--the highest\r\nelevation in Europe. During the present century it has rarely given\r\nevidence of its volcanic origin, and 'the hill that smokes' has\r\nalmost forfeited its claim to the appellation. But at the time of\r\nthe conquest it was frequently in a state of activity, and raged\r\nwith uncommon fury while the Spaniards were at Tlascala; an evil\r\nomen, it was thought, for the natives of Anahuac. Its head,\r\ngathered into a regular cone by the deposit of successive\r\neruptions, wore the usual form of volcanic mountains, when not\r\ndisturbed by the falling in of the crater. Soaring towards the\r\nskies, with its silver sheet of everlasting snow, it was seen far\r\nand wide over the broad plains of Mexico and Puebla; the first\r\nobject which the morning sun greeted in his rising, the last where\r\nhis evening rays were seen to linger, shedding a glorious\r\neffulgence over its head, that contrasted strikingly with the\r\nruinous waste of sand and lava immediately below, and the deep\r\nfringe of funereal pines that shrouded its base.\r\n\r\n\"The mysterious terrors which hung over the spot. and the wild love\r\nof adventure, made some of the Spanish cavaliers desirous to\r\nattempt the ascent, which the natives declared no man could\r\naccomplish and live. Cortés encouraged them in the enterprise,\r\nwilling to show the Indians that no achievement was above the\r\ndauntless daring of his followers. One of his captains,\r\naccordingly, Diego Ordaz, with nine Spaniards, and several\r\nTlascalans, encouraged by their example, undertook the ascent. It\r\nwas attended with more difficulty than had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n\"The lower region was clothed with a dense forest, so thickly\r\nmatted, that in some places it was scarcely possible to penetrate\r\nit. It grew thinner, however, as they advanced, dwindling by\r\ndegrees into a straggling stunted vegetation, till, at the height\r\nof somewhat more than 13,000 feet, it faded away altogether. The\r\nIndians, who had held on thus far; intimidated by the strange\r\nsubterraneous sounds of the volcano, even then in a state of\r\ncombustion, now left them. The track opened on a black surface of\r\nglazed volcanic sand and of lava, the broken fragments of which,\r\narrested in its boiling progress in a thousand fantastic forms,\r\nopposed continual impediments to their advance. Amidst these, one\r\nhuge rock, the Pico del Fraile, a conspicuous object from below,\r\nrose to the perpendicular height of 150 feet, compelling them to\r\ntake a wide circuit. They soon came to the limits of perpetual\r\nsnow, where new difficulties presented themselves, as the\r\ntreacherous ice gave an imperfect footing, and a false step might\r\nprecipitate them into the frozen chasms that yawned around. To\r\nincrease their distress, respiration in these aerial regions became\r\nso difficult, that every effort was attended with sharp pains in\r\nthe head and limbs. Still they pressed on, till, drawing nearer the\r\ncrater, such volumes of smoke, sparks, and cinders were belched\r\nforth from its burning entrails, and driven down the sides of the\r\nmountain, as nearly suffocated and blinded them. It was too much\r\neven for their hardy frames to endure, and, however reluctantly,\r\nthey were compelled to abandon the attempt on the eve of its\r\ncompletion. They brought back some huge icicles--a curious sight in\r\nthose tropical regions--as a trophy of their achievement, which,\r\nhowever imperfect, was sufficient to strike the minds of the\r\nnatives with wonder, by showing that with the Spaniards the most\r\nappalling and mysterious perils were only as pastimes. The\r\nundertaking was eminently characteristic of the bold spirit of the\r\ncavalier of that day, who, not content with the dangers that lay in\r\nhis path, seemed to court them from the mere Quixotic love of\r\nadventure. A report of the affair was transmitted to the Emperor\r\nCharles V.; and the family of Ordaz was allowed to commemorate the\r\nexploit by assuming a burning mountain on their escutcheon.\r\n\r\n\"The general was not satisfied with the result. Two years after he\r\nsent up another party, under Francisco Montano, a cavalier of\r\ndetermined resolution. The object was to obtain sulphur to assist\r\nin making gunpowder for the army. The mountain was quiet at the\r\ntime, and the expedition was attended with better success. The\r\nSpaniards, five in-number, climbed to the very edge of the crater,\r\nwhich presented an irregular ellipse at its mouth, more than a\r\nleague in circumference. Its depth might be from 800 to 1000 feet.\r\nA lurid flame burned gloomily at the bottom, sending up a\r\nsulphureous steam, which, cooling as it rose, was precipitated on\r\nthe sides of the cavity. The party cast lots, and it fell on\r\nMontano himself to descend in a basket into this hideous abyss,\r\ninto which he was lowered by his companions to the depth of 400\r\nfeet! This was repeated several times, till the adventurous\r\ncavalier had collected a sufficient quantity of sulphur for the\r\nwants of the army.\"\r\n\r\nThe more tranquil state of the volcano in modern times having\r\nrendered the summit no longer so difficult of access as it was in\r\nthose days, the ascent has been several times achieved--twice in\r\n1827, and again in 1833 and 1834. The crater is now a large oval\r\nbasin with precipitous walls, composed of beds of lava, of which\r\nsome are black, others of a pale rose tint. At the bottom of the\r\ncrater, which is nearly flat, are several conical vents, whence are\r\ncontinually issuing vapours of variable colour, red, yellow, or\r\nwhite. The beds of sulphur deposited in this crater are worked for\r\neconomical purposes. Two snowy peaks tower above its walls.\r\n\r\nNot less magnificent in its proportions is the volcano of Orizaba,\r\nwhich is nearly of the same height as Popocatepetl. It was very\r\nactive about the middle of the sixteenth century, having had\r\nseveral great eruptions between 1545 and 1560; but since then it\r\nhas sunk into comparative repose. This mountain was ascended by\r\nBaron Muller in 1856. A first attempt proved unsuccessful; but by\r\npassing a night in a grotto near the limit of perpetual snow, he\r\nwas able on the following day, after a toilsome ascent, to reach\r\nthe edge of the crater--not, however, till near sunset. His\r\nexperiences, and the scene which was presented to his wondering\r\ngaze, he describes in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"I have achieved my purpose, and joy banishes all my griefs, but\r\nonly for a moment; suddenly I fell to the ground, and a stream of\r\nblood gushed from my mouth.\r\n\r\n\"On recovering, I found myself still close to the crater, and I\r\nthen summoned all my strength to gaze and observe as much as\r\npossible. My pen cannot describe either the aspect of those\r\nregions, or the impressions they produced on me. Here seemed to be\r\nthe gate of the nether world, enclosing darkness and horror. What\r\nterrible power must have been required to raise and shiver such\r\nenormous masses, to melt them and pile them up like towers, at the\r\nvery moment of their cooling and acquiring their actual forms!\r\n\r\n\"A yellow crust of sulphur coats in several places the internal\r\nwalls, and from the bottom rise several volcanic cones. The soil of\r\nthe crater, so far as I could see, was covered with snow,\r\nconsequently not at all warm. The Indians however affirmed that, at\r\nseveral points, a hot air issues from crevices in the rocks.\r\nAlthough I could not verify their statement, it seemed to me\r\nprobable; for I have often observed similar phenomena in\r\nPopocatepetl.\r\n\r\n\"My original intention of passing the night on the crater had for\r\noverpowering reasons become impracticable. The twilight which, in\r\nthis latitude, as every one knows, is extremely short, having\r\nalready begun, it was necessary to prepare for our return. The two\r\nIndians rolled together the straw mats which they had brought, and\r\nbent them in front so as to form a sort of sledge. We sat down upon\r\nthese, and stretching out our legs, allowed ourselves to glide down\r\non this vehicle. The rapidity with which we were precipitated\r\nincreased to such a degree, that our descent was rather like being\r\nshot through the air, than any other mode of locomotion. In a few\r\nminutes we dashed over a space which it had taken us five hours to\r\nclimb.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several of the West Indian islands of volcanic origin;\r\nand three of them--St. Vincent, Martinique, and Guadaloupe--contain\r\nactive volcanoes. The most remarkable is the volcano of Morne-Garou,\r\nin St. Vincent, the eruptions from which have been\r\nparticularly violent. In 1812 the ashes which it threw out were so\r\ngreat in quantity, and projected to so vast a height, that they\r\nwere carried to a distance of two hundred miles in the teeth of the\r\ntrade-wind. From Mount Pelée, in Martinique, there was an eruption\r\nin August 1851. La Soufriere, the volcano in Guadaloupe, is said to\r\nhave been cleft in twain during an earthquake. Its activity has\r\nlong been in a subdued state; but it is remarkable for its deposits\r\nof sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHawaii, Sandwich Islands--Crater of Kilauea--Its awful Aspect--Fiery\r\nLake and Islands--Jets of Lava--Depth of Crater and Surface\r\nof Lake--Bank of Sulphur--Curious Rainbow--Mouna-Kaah and\r\nMouna-Loa--Eruption of the Latter in 1840--Recent Eruption--Great\r\nJet and Torrent of Lava--Burning of the Forests--Great\r\nWhirlwinds--Underground Explosions--Other Volcanoes in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawaii is well known in history as being the island where the\r\ncelebrated navigator Captain Cook was killed. The name used to be\r\nwritten Owhyhee; but a better apprehension of the native\r\npronunciation has led to its being altered into Hawaii. No one who\r\nvisits it in the present day need be afraid of sharing the fate of\r\npoor Captain Cook; for the descendants of the savages who, in his\r\ntime, inhabited the island, have now, through the labours of\r\nChristian missionaries, become a very decent sort of quiet,\r\nwell-behaved Christian people.\r\n\r\nHawaii, which is the largest of a group called the Sandwich\r\nIslands, can boast of the greatest volcanic crater in the world. It\r\nis called sometimes Kirauea, sometimes Kilauea; for the natives\r\nseem not very particular about the pronunciation of their _l_\r\nand their _r_; but where one uses _l_ another as\r\npertinaciously employs _r_, while a third set use a sound\r\nbetween the two, as you may have heard some people do at home.\r\nSituated on the lower slopes of a lofty mountain called Mouna-Roa,\r\nor Loa (for there is the same dubiety about the _l_ and the\r\n_r_ here as in the former case), the crater of Kilauea is a\r\nvast plain between fifteen and sixteen miles in circumference, and\r\nsunk below the level of its borders to a depth varying from two\r\nhundred to four hundred feet--the walls of rock enclosing it being\r\nfor the most part precipitous. The surface of the ground is very\r\nuneven, being strown with huge stones and masses of volcanic rock,\r\nand it sounds hollow under the tramp of the foot.\r\n\r\nTowards the centre of the plain is a much deeper depression. Those\r\nwho have ventured to approach it, and look down, describe it as an\r\nawful gulf, about eight hundred feet in depth, and presenting a\r\nmost gloomy and dismal aspect. The bottom is covered with molten\r\nlava, forming a great lake of fire, which is continually boiling\r\nviolently, and whose fiery billows exhibit a wild terrific\r\nappearance. The shape of the lake resembles the crescent moon; its\r\nlength is estimated at about two miles, and its greatest breadth at\r\nabout one mile. It has numerous conical islands scattered round the\r\nedge, or in the lake itself, each of them being a little\r\nsubordinate crater. Some of them are continually sending out\r\ncolumns of gray vapour; while from a few others shoots up what\r\nresembles flame. It is, probably, only the bright glare of the lava\r\nthey contain, reflected upwards. Several of these conical islands\r\nare always belching forth from their mouths glowing streams of\r\nlava, which roll in fiery torrents down their black and rugged\r\nsides into the boiling lake below. They are said sometimes to throw\r\nup jets of lava to the height of upwards of sixty feet. The\r\nforegoing woodcut can convey only an imperfect idea of this immense\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Crater of Kilauea]\r\n\r\nThe outer margin of the gulf all round is nearly perpendicular. The\r\nheight of the bounding cliffs is estimated at about four hundred\r\nfeet above a black horizontal ledge of hardened lava, which\r\ncompletely encircles it, and beyond which there is a gradual slope\r\ndown into the burning lake. The surface of the molten lava is at\r\npresent between three and four hundred feet below this horizontal\r\nledge; but the lava is said sometimes to rise quite up to this\r\nlevel, and to force its way out by forming an opening in the side\r\nof the mountain, whence it flows down to the sea. An eruption of\r\nthis kind took place in 1859. On one side of the margin of the lake\r\nthere is a long pale yellow streak formed by a bank of sulphur. The\r\nfaces of the rocks composing the outer walls of the crater have a\r\npale ashy gray appearance, supposed to be due to the action of the\r\nsulphurous vapours. The surface of the plain itself is much rent by\r\nfissures. It is said that the glare from the molten lava in the\r\nlake is so great as to form rainbows on the passing rain-clouds.\r\n\r\nThe entire Island of Hawaii is of volcanic origin; and besides this\r\ngreat crater it contains two other lofty mountains, whose summits\r\nare covered with snow, and whose height is estimated at fifteen or\r\nsixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea. The one is named\r\nMouna-Kaah or Keah, the other is Mouna-Loa--the same on whose lower\r\nflanks the crater of Kilauea is situated. Mouna-Kaah has long been\r\nin a state of repose. So also was Mouna-Loa up to 1840, when it\r\nburst forth with great fury, and it has continued more or less in a\r\nstate of activity ever since. There has been a grand eruption very\r\nlately, said by the natives to have been the greatest of any on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nA new crater opened near the top, at a height of about ten thousand\r\nfeet, and for three days a flood of lava poured down the north-eastern\r\nslope. After a pause of about thirty-six hours, there was\r\nopened on the eastern slope, about half way down the mountain,\r\nanother crater, whence there rose an immense jet of liquid lava,\r\nwhich attained a height of about a thousand feet, and had a\r\ndiameter of about a hundred feet. This jet was sustained for twenty\r\ndays and nights; but during that time its height varied from the\r\nextreme limit of a thousand, down to about a hundred feet. The play\r\nof this fiery fountain was accompanied by explosions so loud as to\r\nbe heard at the distance of forty miles. Nothing could surpass the\r\nawful grandeur of this jet, which was at a white heat when it\r\nissued from its source, but, cooling as it ascended into the air,\r\nit became of a bright blood red, which, as the liquid fell,\r\ndeepened into crimson.\r\n\r\nIn a few days there was raised around this crater a cone of about\r\nthree hundred feet in height, composed of the looser materials\r\nthrown out along with the lava. This cone continued to glow with\r\nintense heat, throwing out occasional flashes. The base of this\r\ncone eventually acquired a circumference of about a mile. But the\r\nfountain itself formed a river of glowing lava, which rushed and\r\nbounded with the speed of a torrent down the sides of the mountain,\r\nfilling up ravines and dashing over precipices, until it reached\r\nthe forests at the foot of the volcano. These burst into flames at\r\nthe approach of the fiery torrent, sending up volumes of smoke and\r\nsteam high into the air. The light from the burning forests and the\r\nlava together was so intense as to turn night into day, and was\r\nseen by mariners at a distance of nearly two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the air throughout a vast extent was filled with a\r\nmurky haze, through which the sun showed only a pallid glimmer.\r\nSmoke, steam, ashes, and cinders were tossed into the air and\r\nwhirled about by fierce winds--sometimes spreading out like a fan,\r\nbut every moment changing both their form and colour. The stream of\r\nlava from the fountain flowed to a distance of about thirty-five\r\nmiles. The scene was altogether terrific--the fierce red glare of\r\nthe lava--the flames from the burning trees--the great volumes of\r\nsmoke and steam--the loud underground explosions and thunderings,--all\r\ncombined to overpower the senses, and fill the mind with\r\nindescribable awe.\r\n\r\nA remarkable volcanic chain runs along the northern and western\r\nmargins of the Pacific Ocean. It embraces the Aleutian Islands, the\r\npeninsula of Kamtschatka, the Kurile, the Japanese, and the\r\nPhilippine Islands. The most interesting are the volcanoes of\r\nKamtschatka, in which there is an oft-renewed struggle between\r\nopposing forces--the snow and glaciers predominating for a while,\r\nto be in their turn overpowered by torrents of liquid fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAtolls, or Coral Islands--Their strange Appearance--Their\r\nConnexion with Volcanoes--Their Mode of Formation--Antarctic\r\nVolcanoes--Diatomaceous Deposits\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the southward of the Sandwich Islands, on the other side of the\r\nequator, there is a large group of islands in the Pacific, which\r\nhave a very peculiar appearance. They are called Atolls or Coral\r\nIslands. Although not exactly of volcanic origin, yet the manner in\r\nwhich they are formed has some connexion with submarine volcanic\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAn atoll consists essentially of a ring of coral rocks but little\r\nelevated above the level of the sea, and having in its centre a\r\nlagoon or salt-water lake, which generally communicates by a deep\r\nnarrow channel with the sea. The ring of rocks is flat on the\r\nsurface, which is composed of friable soil, and sustains a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, chiefly of cocoa-nut palms. It is seldom more\r\nthan half a mile in breadth between the sea and lagoon, sometimes\r\nonly three or four hundred yards. The outer margin of the ring is\r\nthe highest, and it slopes gradually down towards the lagoon; but\r\non the outside of the ledge of rocks is a beach of dazzling\r\nwhiteness, composed of powdered and broken coral and shells. The\r\nappearance they present is thus not less beautiful than singular.\r\nSome of these islands are of large size, from thirty to fifty miles\r\nlong, and from twenty to thirty broad, but they are in general\r\nconsiderably smaller. Their most frequent form is either round or\r\noval. The rocks composing them are all formed by different species\r\nof coral. The animal which constructs them is of the polyp tribe,\r\nand so small that it can be seen only under the higher powers of\r\nthe microscope. It multiplies by means of buds like those of a\r\ntree, the individuals all combining to form a composite stony mass,\r\nwhich is called a polypidom. A number of such polypidoms growing\r\nclose together form a coral reef. See woodcuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Coral]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Coral Polyp]\r\n\r\nIt was at one time supposed that these coral reefs were erected on\r\nthe edges of the craters of submarine volcanoes, an opinion to\r\nwhich their annular form, and the lagoon in the centre, lent some\r\ncountenance; but the vast size of some of them, united to several\r\nother particulars connected with them, threw great doubts over this\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nMore recently it has been shown by Mr. Darwin that, while volcanic\r\nagency does perform a part in their formation, it is different from\r\nwhat had been formerly imagined. His supposition is, that these\r\ncoral reefs were built round the coasts of islands which had once\r\nstood very much higher above water than they do now. He conceives\r\nthat the bottom of the sea under them being very volcanic, and\r\ncontaining large collections of molten lava beneath a thin solid\r\ncrust, the islands have gradually sunk down into the lava, until\r\ntheir central parts have become covered with a considerable depth\r\nof water. The central parts thus submerged, he imagines, form the\r\nlagoons in the middle of the islands, while the ring of coral reefs\r\nhas gradually grown upwards, as the ground on which it rested sank\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Coral Reef.]\r\n\r\nThe corals thus rise to near the surface, but immediately on their\r\nbeing uncovered by the water they die, and the reef ceases to grow.\r\nThen the waves by their action break the upper part of it into\r\npieces, which thus become heaped up by degrees on the remainder,\r\nuntil the mass attain so great a height that the sea can no longer\r\nwash over it. Thus the curious ring of land is gradually formed,\r\nand affords a nutritive soil, in which cocoa-nuts, on being cast\r\nashore, germinate and grow to be large trees. Other seeds, wafted\r\nby the waves or carried by birds, also begin to grow, until the\r\nwhole surface becomes covered with vegetation. Then comes man and\r\nbuilds his habitation upon those fertile spots, and finds in them\r\nan agreeable and convenient abode, well suited to those who are\r\naccustomed to live by fishing and other simple means.\r\n\r\nYou will thus perceive that the connexion between the atoll and the\r\nvolcano consists in this--that while the coral builds up the reef,\r\nthe volcano beneath ingulfs the island and causes it to sink down.\r\nIn some instances, however, the volcano, after a while, reverses\r\nits action, and raises up the island with the reef upon it. In such\r\ncases, the coral reefs are seen standing out of the water, forming\r\nperpendicular cliffs several hundred feet in height. Then also the\r\ninterior of the island becomes once more dry land, and that, too,\r\nof great fertility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Mount Erebus.]\r\n\r\nAlmost due south of that region, in the Pacific, where the coral\r\nislands abound, but at a great distance from them, and considerably\r\nwithin the limits of the Antarctic zone, lies South Victoria. Here,\r\nin lat. 76 degrees S., Captain Ross discovered, in 1841, two\r\nvolcanoes, which he called Erebus and Terror, after the names of\r\nhis two ships. Of the former, which is the higher of the two, a\r\nview is given in the annexed woodcut. It is covered with perpetual\r\nsnow from the bottom even to the tip of the summit. Nevertheless,\r\nit is continually sending forth vast columns of vapour, which glow\r\nwith the reflection of the white hot lava beneath. These vapours\r\nascend to a great height, more than two thousand feet above the top\r\nof the cone, which is itself twelve thousand feet above the level\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nThere is found in these frozen regions a remarkable botanical\r\ncuriosity, having a certain connexion with volcanoes. The waters of\r\nthe ocean, all along the borders of the icy barrier, produce in\r\namazing abundance the family of water-plants named Diatomaceae. The\r\nDiatoms are so called from their faculty of multiplying themselves\r\nindefinitely by splitting into two; and so rapidly is this process\r\nperformed, that in a month a single diatom may produce a thousand\r\nmillions. The quantity found in the Antarctic regions is so immense\r\nthat, between the parallels of 60 degrees and 80 degrees of south\r\nlatitude, they stain the whole surface of the sea of a pale olive-brown\r\ntint. These plants, which are so minute as to be individually\r\ninvisible, save under the higher powers of the microscope, have the\r\ncurious property of encrusting themselves with a sheath, or shell,\r\nof pure silica. These shells remain after the death of the plant,\r\nand are as indestructible as flint. They are marvellous objects,\r\nboth as respects the elegance of their forms and the beauty of\r\ntheir markings. So great is the accumulation of these shells at the\r\nbottom of the sea, that they have formed an immense bank 400 miles\r\nin length by 120 in breadth, between the 76th and 78th degrees of\r\nsouth latitude. One portion of this bank rests on the coast at the\r\nfoot of Mount Erebus.\r\n\r\nNow, it is remarkable that these microscopic shells of Diatoms are\r\nnot unfrequently found in the ejections of volcanoes; while it is\r\ngenerally supposed that, in the case of those situated near the\r\nsea, eruptions are caused by the formation of explosive steam\r\nconsequent on the access of sea-water to the reservoirs of molten\r\nlava lying underground. The proximity of this Diatomaceous bed to\r\nMount Erebus would easily explain how these minute shells might be\r\nfound abundant in the fine dust ejected from that volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes of Java--Papandayang--Mountain Ingulfed--Great\r\nDestruction of Life and Property--Galoen-gong--Destructive\r\nEruption--Mount Merapia--Great Eruption, with Hurricane--Another,\r\nvery destructive--Mud Volcano Crater of Tankuban-Prahu--Island of\r\nSumbáwa--Volcano of Tomboro--Terrific Eruption--Timor--A Volcano\r\nquenches itself--Cleaving of Mount Machian--Sangir--Destructive\r\nEruption--Bourbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most marvellous volcanic regions in the world is that\r\ncomposed of the islands of the Malayan Archipelago in the Indian\r\nOcean. They form a chain stretching from east to west, but curving\r\nup towards the north at the western extremity. The most easterly of\r\nthe chain is Timor, the most westerly Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the group is Java, which is almost entirely\r\nof volcanic origin, and contains no less than thirty-eight\r\nmountains of that conical form which indicates their having at one\r\ntime or other been active volcanoes. Only a few of them, however,\r\nhave been in activity in more recent times. The most remarkable\r\neruption was that of the mountain named Papandayang, which occurred\r\nin 1772. During this convulsion the greater part of the mountain,\r\nwhich was formerly one of the largest in the island, was completely\r\nswallowed up in some great underground gulf.\r\n\r\nOn the night between the 11th and 12th of August of that year, the\r\nmountain appeared to be wholly enveloped in a remarkable luminous\r\ncloud. The inhabitants fled in consternation; but before they could\r\nall escape, the mountain began to totter, and the greater part of\r\nit tumbled down and disappeared. The crash with which it fell was\r\ndreadful, the noise resembling the discharge of volleys of\r\nartillery. Besides that part of the mountain which thus fell in, a\r\nlarge extent of ground in its neighbourhood was ingulfed. The space\r\nmeasured fifteen miles in length and six in breadth. The ground for\r\nmany miles round this space was covered with immense quantities of\r\nashes, stones, cinders, and other substances thrown out by the\r\nvolcano. These were, on many parts of the surface, accumulated to\r\nthe height of three feet; and even at the end of six weeks, the\r\nlayers thus deposited retained so much heat as to render the\r\nmountain inaccessible. By this dreadful occurrence forty villages\r\nwere destroyed, some ingulfed with the ground on which they stood,\r\nothers buried under the loose materials which had been ejected. Not\r\nfar short of three thousand of the inhabitants perished.\r\n\r\nAnother of the volcanoes of Java, called Galoen-gong, burst into\r\neruption in 1822, commencing with a terrible explosion of stones,\r\nashes, &c., followed by a stream of hot mud, which overspread a\r\nlarge tract of ground. This eruption proved still more fatal to\r\nhuman life, about four thousand persons having been destroyed.\r\n\r\nSo lately as September 1849, Mount Merapia, another volcano in this\r\nisland, which had been supposed to be quite extinct, burst forth\r\ninto an eruption, which lasted three days. It was accompanied by a\r\nviolent hurricane. The bed of a river was filled up by the matter\r\nthrown out from the crater, and the destruction of property in\r\ncrops, &c., was immense. Fortunately the inhabitants succeeded in\r\nmaking their escape, so that no lives were lost. A second eruption\r\nof this mountain however, in January 1864, was more disastrous,\r\nthree hundred and fifty people having perished.\r\n\r\nJava likewise contains a remarkable mud volcano. When viewed from a\r\ndistance, there are seen to rise from it large volumes of vapour,\r\nlike the spray from the billows dashing against a rocky shore, and\r\nthere is heard a loud noise like distant thunder. On a nearer\r\napproach, the source of these phenomena is seen to be a\r\nhemispherical mound of black earth mixed with water, about sixteen\r\nfeet in diameter, and which at intervals of a few seconds is pushed\r\nupwards by a force acting from beneath to a height of between\r\ntwenty and thirty feet. It then suddenly explodes with a loud\r\nnoise, scattering in every direction a quantity of black mud, which\r\nhas a strong pungent smell resembling that of coal-tar, and is\r\nconsiderably warmer than the air. With the mud thus thrown out\r\nthere has been formed around the mound a large perfectly level and\r\nnearly circular plain, about half a mile in circumference. The\r\nwater mixed with the mud is salt, and the salt is separated from it\r\nby evaporation for economical purposes. During the rainy season the\r\naction of this mud volcano becomes more violent, the explosions are\r\nlouder, and the mud is thrown to a greater height.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Tangkuban-Prahu, another of the volcanoes of Java,\r\npresents a remarkable appearance. On approaching its edge, nothing\r\nis seen but an abyss, from which dense clouds of vapour continually\r\narise, with hideous sounds, like the steam rushing from the open\r\nvalves of hundreds of steam-engines. This great abyss consists\r\nreally of two craters, separated the one from the other by a narrow\r\nridge of rock, to which it is possible to descend and view them\r\nboth. Each of them is elliptical in form, and surrounded by a\r\ncrater-wall. That of the western, which the natives call the\r\npoison-crater, is a rapid slope nearly a thousand feet in depth,\r\nand is densely covered with brushwood almost to the bottom. The\r\nflat floor of this deep basin is continually sending out vapours,\r\nand in its centre is a pool of boiling water of a sulphur yellow\r\ncolour. The floor itself is nothing but a crust of sulphur full of\r\nrents and holes, whence vapours constantly arise. This crust covers\r\na surface of boiling hot bitter water, and by breaking it beautiful\r\ncrystals of sulphur may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe eastern is called by the natives the king's-crater; its walls\r\nare only between five and six hundred feet in depth, and are\r\nperfectly bare from top to bottom. The surfaces of the rocks\r\ncomposing them are grayish white, an effect produced upon them by\r\nthe action of the vapours, to which they are continually exposed.\r\nThe bottom of this crater consists of mud mixed with sulphur; but\r\nround the edges are some stones and hard masses. These are the\r\nremnants of an eruption which took place from this crater in 1846,\r\nwhen there was thrown up a great mass of sulphurous boiling mud,\r\naccompanied by quantities of sand and stones. This mountain,\r\ntherefore, seems to be also more of the nature of a mud volcano,\r\nthan of one which throws out burning lava.\r\n\r\nNearly in a right line to the eastward of Java lies the Island of\r\nSumbáwa, in which stands the volcano of Tomboro, the most violent\r\nin its eruptions of any in the world. One of the most remarkable\r\noccurred in the year 1815, beginning on the 5th of April and\r\ncontinuing till the middle of July. Its effects were felt over an\r\nimmense tract of country, embracing the Molucca Islands, Java, and\r\nportions of Celebes, Sumatra, and Borneo. The concussions produced\r\nby its explosions were sensible at a distance of a thousand miles\r\nall round; and their sound is said to have been heard even at so\r\ngreat a distance as seventeen hundred miles. In Java the day was\r\ndarkened by clouds of ashes, thrown from the mountain to that great\r\ndistance (three hundred miles), and the houses, streets, and\r\nfields, were covered to the depth of several inches with the ashes\r\nthat fell from the air. So great was the quantity of ashes ejected,\r\nthat the roofs of houses forty miles distant from the volcano were\r\nbroken in by their weight. The effects of the eruption extended\r\neven to the western coasts of Sumatra, where masses of pumice were\r\nseen floating on the surface of the sea, several feet in thickness\r\nand many miles in extent.\r\n\r\nFrom the crater itself there were seen to ascend three fiery\r\ncolumns, which, after soaring to a great height, appeared to unite\r\nin a confused manner at their tops. Ere long, the whole of the side\r\nof the mountain next the village of Sang'ir seemed like one vast\r\nbody of liquid fire. The glare was terrific, until towards evening,\r\nwhen it became partly obscured by the vast quantities of dust,\r\nashes, stones, and cinders thrown up from the crater. Between nine\r\nand ten o'clock at night the ashes and stones began to fall upon\r\nthe village of Sang'ir, and all round the neighbourhood of the\r\nmountain. Then arose a dreadful whirlwind, which blew down nearly\r\nevery house in the village, tossing the roofs and lighter parts\r\nhigh into the air. In the neighbouring sea-port the effects were\r\neven more violent, the largest trees having been torn up by the\r\nroots and whirled aloft. Before such a furious tempest no living\r\nthing could stand. Men, horses, and cattle were whirled into the\r\nair like so much chaff, and then dashed violently down on the\r\nground. The sea rose nearly twelve feet above the highest tide-mark,\r\nsweeping away houses, trees, everything within its reach.\r\n\r\nThis whirlwind lasted about an hour, and then commenced the awful\r\ninternal thunderings of the mountain. These continued with scarcely\r\nany intermission until the 11th of July, when they became more\r\nmoderate, the intervals between them gradually increasing till the\r\n15th of July, when they ceased. Almost all the villages for a long\r\ndistance round the mountain were destroyed; and it is computed that\r\nnearly twelve thousand persons perished. By far the greatest part\r\nof this destruction was wrought by the violence of the whirlwind\r\nwhich accompanied the eruption.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to the eastward of Sumbáwa lies the Island of Timor,\r\nin which there was for a long time a volcanic peak, whose perpetual\r\nfires served as a lighthouse to mariners navigating those seas. But\r\nin the year 1637 there took place a great eruption of the mountain,\r\nwhich ended in its being gobbled up whole and entire, leaving\r\nnothing behind it but a lake, in which its fires were quenched, and\r\nwhich now occupies its place.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Timor lie the Molucca Islands, several of which are\r\nvolcanic. In one of them, named Machian, there occurred in the year\r\n1646 an extraordinary event. A mountain was rent from top to\r\nbottom, sending out great columns of fire and dense vapours. The\r\ntwo parts now remain two distinct mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Sangir, another of the Moluccas, there was a\r\nviolent eruption in March 1856. A large portion of the mountain\r\nfell down, and tremendous floods of water issued forth. The\r\ndestruction that ensued was dreadful, upwards of two thousand\r\npersons having perished.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the Indian Ocean, near Madagascar, lies the\r\nlittle Isle of Bourbon, containing the volcano Salazes, which\r\noccasionally throws out the curious thready substance already\r\nmentioned, so strongly resembling spun glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMud and Air Volcanoes--Luss--Macaluba--Taman--Korabetoff--New\r\nIsland in the Sea of Azof--Jokmali--Fires of Baku--Mud Volcano in\r\nFlank of Etna--Air Volcanoes of Turbaco, Cartagena, and Galera-Zamba.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curious mud volcano in the Island of Java, described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, although presenting some peculiar features,\r\nis not the only one of the kind in the world. Mud, as you have\r\nlearned, is often thrown out in great quantities, along with\r\nboiling water, even by true volcanoes, which at other times eject\r\nashes and lava. But there are some volcanoes that never throw out\r\nanything else than mud and water, gas and steam. Such are called\r\nmud volcanoes or salses.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable assemblage of mud volcanoes in the world exists\r\nin the district of Luss, lying at the south-east corner of\r\nBeloochistan. They extend over a very large area, and are\r\nexceedingly numerous. The cone of one of them is no less than four\r\nhundred feet high, and the crater at the top is ninety feet in\r\ndiameter. The mud in the crater is quite liquid, and is constantly\r\ndisturbed by bubbles of gas, and occasionally by jets of the mud\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMore familiarly known is the mud volcano of Macaluba, near\r\nGirgenti, in Sicily. It is situated in a country much impregnated\r\nwith sulphur and other inflammable matters. The top of the hill is\r\ncovered with dry clay, in which are numerous basins full of warmish\r\nwater mixed with mud and bitumen. From these small craters bubbles\r\nof gas arise from time to time; but at long intervals they become\r\nmuch more active, and throw up jets of wet mud to the height of\r\nnearly two hundred feet. This mud smells strongly of sulphur.\r\n\r\nIn the peninsula of Taman, near the entrance to the Sea of Azof,\r\nthere is a group of mud volcanoes, from one of which there was a\r\nconsiderable eruption on the 27th of February 1793. It was preceded\r\nby underground detonations, and accompanied by a column of fire and\r\ndense vapour, which rose to the height of several hundred feet. The\r\ndischarge of mud and gas was abundant. The accompaniment of fire\r\nand smoke makes this eruption more nearly resemble that of a true\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nThere is in the adjacent parts of the Crimea a mountain named\r\nKorabetoff, which also presents similar phenomena. On the 6th of\r\nAugust 1853, a column of fire and smoke was seen to rise from the\r\ntop of this mountain to a great height, and it continued for five\r\nor six minutes. Two other similar but less violent ejections of\r\nfire and smoke followed at short intervals. These appearances were\r\nthe accompaniments of an eruption of black fetid mud, which\r\noverspread the ground at the foot of the mountain to a considerable\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nA still more striking phenomenon occurred in the Sea of Azof, on\r\nthe 10th of May 1814. On that day a column of flame and very thick\r\nsmoke arose out of the water, with a loud report like that of a\r\ncannon, and masses of earth with large stones were tossed high up\r\ninto the air. Ten eruptions of this kind succeeded each other at\r\nintervals of about a quarter of an hour; and after they had ceased\r\nfor a time, they began again during the night. Next morning it was\r\nfound that an island had risen out of the sea, between nine and ten\r\nfeet in height, surrounded by a lower level of hardened mud. A\r\nstrong fetid smell, probably that of petroleum, proceeded from the\r\nisland, and extended for a considerable distance all round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Air Volcanoes of Turbaco]\r\n\r\nAnother mud volcano, named Jokmali, near the Caspian Sea, was\r\nformed in November 1827. In this case, also, the ejection of mud\r\nwas for several hours preceded by flames, rising to so great a\r\nheight that they could be seen at a distance of twenty-four miles.\r\nLarge pieces of rock were at the same time thrown up and scattered\r\nto considerable distances all round. The entire district in which\r\nthis mountain is situated, has its soil copiously impregnated with\r\npetroleum, and numerous wells are formed for its collection.\r\nQuantities of this mineral oil are frequently found floating on the\r\nsea, along the neighbouring shores, where the sailors are in the\r\nhabit of setting fire to this floating petroleum, while they\r\ndexterously steer their boats so as to avoid the flames. In this\r\ndistrict also stands the city of Baku, held sacred by the Parsees,\r\nor fire-worshippers, who have here built a temple, in which are\r\nkept burning perpetual fires, fed by the naphtha springing from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, 1866, a small mud volcano has been formed in\r\nthe flanks of Mount Etna. It began with an outburst of strong jets\r\nof boiling water. First, one rose to the height of about six feet,\r\nthen several others broke out, whereupon the height of the whole\r\nset diminished. There was much gas bubbling through the water, and\r\nsome petroleum floated on its surface. It was very muddy, and left\r\na thick deposit as it flowed away. Neither flames nor noise\r\naccompanied this eruption.\r\n\r\nThere are also diminutive volcanoes, consisting of small conical\r\nhills, from which nothing seems to be emitted but various sorts of\r\ngas. These are called air volcanoes. Such are those of Turbaco in\r\nSouth America, discovered by Baron Humboldt, who has left us a\r\npicture of them, of which you here have a copy. These volcanic\r\nhillocks are truncated cones, eighteen or twenty in number,\r\ncomposed of hardened mud, from 18 to 24 feet in height, and from\r\nabout 140 to about 180 feet in diameter at the base. The small\r\ncraters at the top are filled with liquid mud, whence bubbles of\r\ngas, chiefly nitrogen, are being continually disengaged.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar, but much larger, group in the neighbouring\r\nprovince of Cartagena. It consists of about one hundred cones\r\nspread over a district of nearly four hundred square leagues. There\r\nis also a group of about fifty cones within a range of four or five\r\nmiles in the adjacent peninsula of Galera-Zamba. A sub-marine\r\nvolcano, from which there have been several eruptions, is supposed\r\nto be connected with these numerous salses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand--Boiling Fountains and Lakes\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eruptions of mud volcanoes, described in the foregoing\r\nchapter, a frequent ingredient is boiling water. There are,\r\nhowever, several instances in which there are thrown up jets of\r\nboiling water that are not intermingled with mud, but in which the\r\nwater is either pure or impregnated with some mineral which it\r\nholds in perfect solution. Of this nature are the Geysers of\r\nIceland and California, already described.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand there is another variety of this phenomenon, the\r\nboiling water issuing forth, not in intermittent jets, as in the\r\nGeysers, but in perpetually flowing springs, forming lakes, in\r\nwhich the water remains nearly at the boiling point. These springs\r\nand lakes occur at a place called Roto-Mahana. The annexed woodcut\r\nwill convey an idea of their appearance.\r\n\r\nThere are several basins raised one above another, and all higher\r\nthan the level of the large lake. The highest is of an oval form,\r\nand about two hundred and fifty feet in circumference. It is filled\r\nfrom an opening at the height of about a hundred feet above the\r\nlevel of the lower lake. At various stages below this upper basin\r\nare numerous other springs, from which several similar basins are\r\nfilled. The whole of these basins empty themselves into the large\r\nlake below, and the water in all of them is nearly boiling hot,\r\ngiving forth, with a hissing sound, volumes of white vapour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Boiling Lakes of Roto Mahana]\r\n\r\nThese waters are richly impregnated with carbonate of lime, which\r\nhas formed all round the margins of the basins beautiful\r\nincrustations of snowy whiteness. The sand round the lake is very\r\nwarm; and if a stick be thrust into it, jets of steam arise.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, some years hence, the enterprising English settlers will\r\nestablish hot baths here. Not far from the lake there are smaller\r\nbasins, in which the water is not beyond what would be agreeable\r\nfor a warm bath; while it is of a blue colour and beautifully\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nOn both banks of the river Waikato, also in this neighbourhood, are\r\nfound numerous basins full of boiling mud or slime, which cannot be\r\napproached save with extreme care, owing to the softness and\r\nslipperiness of the soil. The largest of these basins is oval in\r\nform, 14 feet long by 8 feet wide, and about as much in depth. It\r\ncontains hot mud of a bright red colour, being strongly impregnated\r\nwith oxide of iron. Large viscous bubbles are continually rising to\r\nthe top, and on bursting they emit a fetid, sulphureous smell.\r\nThese phenomena are nearly akin to those of a mud volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nUnderground Sounds--Quito--Rio Apure--Guanaxuato--Melida--Nakous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least remarkable among the phenomena produced by volcanic\r\nforces, are the strange underground noises which are occasionally\r\nheard. For the most part these are the preludes either of shocks of\r\nearthquake or of volcanic eruptions. Those which for months\r\npreceded the upheaval of the volcano of Jorullo, will recur to your\r\nremembrance. For about a month before the great mud eruption from\r\nTunguragua on 4th February 1797, already described, there proceeded\r\nfrom the interior of that mountain noises of the most fearful kind.\r\nThese would occur suddenly in the midst of perfect silence. They\r\nwere heard by Antonio Pineda, the naturalist, who was there at the\r\ntime, and they led him to foretell the approach of some great\r\nconvulsion. Strange to say, however, the catastrophe itself was\r\nunaccompanied by underground noises any where near the volcano.\r\nBut, stranger still, at Quito, which is distant about 200 miles, a\r\nshort time after the eruption began, there were heard tremendous\r\nunderground thunders. But this distance, between the site of the\r\nunderground noises and the probable focus of disturbance, was far\r\nexceeded in another remarkable instance. It is stated by Humboldt\r\nthat, in the grassy plains of Calaboso, on the banks of the Rio\r\nApure, a tributary of the Orinoco, there were heard, over a large\r\nextent of country, loud underground thunders, unaccompanied by any\r\nshaking of the ground; while great streams of lava were being\r\npoured forth from the crater of Morne-Garou, in the Island of St.\r\nVincent, at the distance of no less than 632 miles in a right line.\r\nThis was as though an eruption of Mount Vesuvius were accompanied\r\nby underground thunders in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThere have, nevertheless, been instances of the existence of such\r\nunderground noises, without their having been followed either by an\r\nearthquake, by a volcanic eruption, or any other outward appearance\r\nwhatever. One of the most remarkable cases of the kind, was that\r\nmentioned by Humboldt as having occurred at Guanaxuato in Mexico, a\r\nmountain-city situated far from any active volcano. This celebrated\r\ntraveller states that these noises began on the 9th of January\r\n1784, and lasted above a month. The sounds were at first neither\r\nvery loud nor very frequent; but from the 15th to the 16th of\r\nJanuary they resembled continuous low rolling thunder, alternating\r\nwith short loud thunder-claps. The sounds then gradually died away\r\nand nothing came of them, although they excited great terror among\r\nthe inhabitants while they lasted. There are mines in the\r\nneighbourhood fifteen hundred and ninety-eight English feet in\r\ndepth, yet neither in them nor at the surface could the least\r\ntremor be detected.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar phenomenon occurred in the Island of Melida in\r\nthe Adriatic, off the coast of Dalmatia, where underground\r\nrumblings were heard from March 1822 to September 1824; but in this\r\ncase the sounds were sometimes accompanied by shocks.\r\n\r\nA still more singular phenomenon of this sort occurs on the borders\r\nof the Red Sea, at a place called Nakous, where intermittent\r\nunderground sounds have been heard for an unknown number of\r\ncenturies. It is situated at about half a mile's distance from the\r\nshore, whence a long reach of sand ascends rapidly to a height of\r\nabout three hundred feet. This reach is about eighty feet wide, and\r\nresembles an amphitheatre, being walled in by low rocks. The sounds\r\ncoming up from the ground at this place recur at intervals of about\r\nan hour. They at first resemble a low murmur; but ere long there is\r\nheard a loud knocking, somewhat like the strokes of a bell, and\r\nwhich, at the end of about five minutes, becomes so strong as to\r\nagitate the sand.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this curious phenomenon given by the Arabs, is,\r\nthat there is a convent under the ground here, and that these\r\nsounds are those of the bell, which the monks ring for prayers. So\r\nthey call it \"Nakous,\" which means a bell. The Arabs affirm that\r\nthe noise so frightens their camels when they hear it as to render\r\nthem furious. Philosophers attribute the sounds to suppressed\r\nvolcanic action--probably to the bubbling of gas or vapours\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nExtinct Volcanoes--Auvergne--Vienne--Agde--Eyfel--Italy--Lacus\r\nCimini--Grotto del Cane--Guevo Upas--Talaga Bodas--The Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of extinct volcanoes: _first_, those in\r\nwhich all evidences of activity have entirely ceased; and,\r\n_secondly_, those in which a subdued state of activity\r\nlingers. The former are more widely distributed than the latter;\r\nbut sometimes both kinds occur in the same district of country.\r\n\r\nExtinct volcanoes are found in the district of Auvergne in France.\r\nSolidified streams of lava occur at Volvic near Riom; and the\r\ncrater whence they descended is still visible on the top of the Puy\r\nde Nugere. It is an oblong basin, having its edge broken on the\r\nside down which the lava flowed. In its descent the fiery stream\r\nappears to have encountered a knoll of granite, by which it was\r\ndivided into two branches. These seem to have reunited lower down,\r\nand thence to have overspread the valley beneath.\r\n\r\nThe Puy de Côme, a mountain near Clermont, appears to have sent\r\nforth two streams of lava, which have effected considerable changes\r\nin the surface of the country--blocking up the courses of rivers\r\ndiverting them into new channels, and forming swamps in the old. On\r\nthe top of Puy Pariou, to the north of Clermont, there exists a\r\nperfect crater, quite round, and about two hundred and fifty feet\r\ndeep, whence there has flowed a stream of lava, whose course can be\r\ndistinctly traced. The summit of Puy Graveniere, a long round-backed\r\nhill also near Clermont, consists almost entirely of a heap\r\nof volcanic cinders, which have obliterated all traces of a crater;\r\nbut two streams of lava appear to have flowed from the sides of the\r\nmountain. The Puy de Dôme, and the mountains in its neighbourhood,\r\nlikewise appear to be of volcanic origin, and to have been upheaved\r\nsomewhat in the same manner as Jorullo. Although the aspect of the\r\nmountains of Auvergne indicates so clearly their having been active\r\nsince the surrounding country acquired its present general\r\nconformation, neither history nor tradition has preserved any\r\nrecord of their eruptions.\r\n\r\nThere is extant, however, a letter from Sidonius Apollinaris, a\r\ncotemporary of Pliny, addressed to the Bishop of Vienne, in which\r\nhe refers to forms of prayer which had been appointed by the bishop\r\nat the time when earthquakes demolished the walls of Vienne, and\r\nthe mountains, opening, vomited forth torrents of inflamed\r\nmaterials. It hence appears that the extinct volcanoes in the\r\nneighbourhood of Vienne, and perhaps those of Le Puy, had been in a\r\nstate of eruption not long after the beginning of the Christian\r\nera. To the westward of the latter town, there is a number of small\r\nvolcanic craters, of which the two largest are the Lake de Bouchet\r\nand the Crater of Bar, which also appears to have been at one time\r\na lake, but is now dry. The former has its greatest diameter about\r\n2300 feet, with a depth of about 90 feet. The latter is on the top\r\nof a mountain, which is composed entirely of such substances as are\r\nejected by volcanoes. Its diameter is about 1660, and its depth\r\nabout 130 feet; while it is almost perfect in its form. The\r\nmountains near Vienne exhibit streams of lava, which accommodate\r\nthemselves to the existing valleys. Near Agde also, on the shores\r\nof the Gulf of Lions, on the top of a hill named St. Loup, there is\r\nan extinct crater, whence have descended two streams of lava\r\napparently of recent origin. On one of them the town of Agde has\r\nbeen built; the other projects into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe district of Eyfel, on the borders of the Rhine, is another in\r\nwhich extinct volcanoes abound. They occur mostly in the form of\r\ncircular craters, which are now filled with water, their borders\r\nconsisting of volcanic ejections. They also exhibit various\r\nsuperficial streams of lava. One of the most remarkable of these\r\nround craters lies near Andernuch, a little west of the Rhine. It\r\nis named the Lake of Laach, and is nearly two miles in circumference.\r\nOn its margin are found numerous volcanic ejections, exactly\r\nresembling those of Mount Vesuvius. Notwithstanding these\r\nevidences that the extinct volcanoes of Eyfel have been in activity\r\nsince the country acquired its present conformation, there are no\r\nhistorical records of their operations. There is, indeed, a passage\r\nin Tacitus referring to fires that issued from the earth near\r\nCologne; but his description does not warrant the conclusion that\r\nthe event to which he alludes was of the nature of a volcanic\r\neruption. The Drachenfels on the eastern bank of the Rhine, and the\r\nother mountains in its neighbourhood, belong to the more ancient\r\nvolcanic formations. The same may be affirmed of the other\r\nmountains scattered throughout Germany and central Europe\r\ngenerally, in which rocks of volcanic origin occur.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many traces of extinct volcanoes in Italy, besides\r\nthose of the Phlegræan fields already mentioned. In general\r\ncharacter they resemble those previously described. The chief\r\nlocalities are certain lakes, near Volterra in Tuscany, which give\r\nforth very hot sulphurous and boracic acid vapours; a small\r\nsulphureous lake near Viterbo continually giving forth bubbles of\r\ngas; the Lake of Vico between Viterbo and Rome; the mountain and\r\nLake of Albano near Rome; Mount Vultur in the Apennines, in the\r\nprovince of the Basilicata; and Lake Agnano near Naples. Of these,\r\nthe Lakes of Vico and Agnano are the most interesting. The former\r\nis the ancient Lacus Cimini, and old authors state that its site\r\nwas once occupied by a town, whose ruins used to be visible at the\r\nbottom of the lake when the water was clear. The ground, with the\r\ntown upon it, is said to have been ingulfed during a volcanic\r\nconvulsion, when the lake was formed in its place.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Agnano is the site of an ancient volcanic crater, and on\r\nits margin is situated the Grotto del Cane, so famous for the\r\ndeadly vapours it exhales. These consist of carbonic acid gas, in\r\ncombination with watery vapour. This celebrated Grotto is thus\r\ndescribed, in his work on volcanoes, by Dr. Daubeny, who visited\r\nthe spot:--\r\n\r\n\"The mouth of the cavern being somewhat more elevated than its\r\ninterior, a stratum of carbonic acid goes on constantly\r\naccumulating at the bottom, but upon rising above the level of its\r\nmouth, flows like so much water over the brim. Hence the upper part\r\nof the cavern is free from any noxious vapour; but the air of that\r\nbelow is so fully impregnated, that it proves speedily fatal to any\r\nanimal that is immersed in it, as is shown to all strangers by the\r\nexperiment with the dog.\r\n\r\n\"The sensation I experienced, on stooping my head for a moment to\r\nthe bottom, resembled that of which we are sometimes sensible on\r\ndrinking a large glass of soda water in a state of brisk\r\neffervescence. The cause in both instances is plainly the same.\r\n\r\n\"The quantity of carbonic acid present in the cavern at various\r\nheights, was shown by immersing in it various combustibles in a\r\nstate of inflammation. I found that phosphorus would continue\r\nlighted at about two feet from the bottom, whilst a sulphur match\r\nwent out a few inches above, and a wax taper at a still higher\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\"It was impossible to fire a pistol at the bottom of the cavern,\r\nfor although gunpowder may be exploded even in carbonic acid by the\r\napplication of a heat sufficient to decompose the nitre, and\r\nconsequently to envelop the mass in an atmosphere of oxygen gas,\r\nyet the mere influence of a spark from steel produces too slight an\r\naugmentation of temperature for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena, but on a grander scale, are presented by the\r\nextinct crater in the Island of Java called \"Guevo Upas,\" the\r\nPoison-Valley. It is a level about half a mile in circumference,\r\nsurrounded by precipitous rocks. From various parts of its soil\r\ncarbonic acid gas is discharged in such quantities as to prove\r\nfatal to any animal venturing nigh. The ground is consequently\r\nstrown with numerous skeletons. This valley gave rise to the famous\r\nfigment about the upas-tree, which once obtained such general\r\nbelief in Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is another extinct crater in Java, whence are exhaled vapours\r\nequally deadly, but which exert a most peculiar effect on the dead\r\ncarcasses subjected to their influence. Instead of their being, as\r\nin the Gruevo Upas, reduced to skeletons, the carcasses have all\r\ntheir bones dissolved by the vapours; while the flesh, skin, hair,\r\nand nails are by their action preserved from decay. This remarkable\r\ncrater is situated near the volcano of Talaga Bodas.\r\n\r\nOf all the extinct volcanoes in the world, however, none is so\r\nremarkable as the Dead Sea. That singular collection of salt and\r\nbitter water has the level of its surface depressed 1312 feet below\r\nthat of the Mediterranean--thus indicating an enormous subsidence.\r\nThe Dead Sea occupies the site of what was formerly the plain of\r\nJordan, described as having been \"well-watered everywhere, as the\r\ngarden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt.\" One part of it, called\r\nthe Vale of Siddim, was full of slime-pits--the only indications of\r\nvolcanic action. When the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which stood\r\nin the plain, were destroyed, the Lord, it is said, rained upon\r\nthem fire and brimstone from heaven; but while these fell upon the\r\ncities from the atmosphere, it appears that they must have\r\nprimarily been discharged from the earth; for \"the smoke of the\r\ncountry went up as the smoke of a furnace.\" The phenomena,\r\ntherefore, most likely resembled, in the first instance, those of\r\nJorullo; but the catastrophe seems to have ended like the last\r\ngreat eruption of the volcano in Timor--the whole of the plain\r\nhaving been ingulfed and replaced by the salt lake, whose depressed\r\nlevel so clearly indicates the nature of its origin.",
