It drew human life to our rich area of\r\nFairfax County, and sustained us for centuries before we became so\r\nself-conscious about it as to make household language of words such as\r\necology and bio-degradable waste. This is where we are at, however,\r\nand thus it is thoroughly appropriate that the publication of\r\nhistorical research reports in this format, a new program for Fairfax\r\nCounty, should commence with a study of the Green Spring Farm. There\r\nis no better site for an example, probably, to illustrate the early\r\npatterns of life on the agricultural land of Fairfax County as well as\r\nto follow the changes and pressures that have come about through war,\r\ndepression, boom, and technological change down to the present. Anyone\r\nfamiliar with the history of this parcel of land, the Green Spring\r\nFarm, will be familiar with a great deal of the history of Fairfax\r\nCounty--told not so much in terms of its famous and powerful people as\r\nin terms of those who drew sustenance directly from the land.\r\n\r\nThis report is published under authority of the Board of Supervisors\r\nof the County of Fairfax. It is one result of a program of historical\r\nsite survey and research carried on by the Fairfax County Division of\r\nPlanning in cooperation with the Fairfax County History Commission.\r\nThe original selection of Green Spring Farm as a research topic was\r\nmade by the Fairfax County Historical Landmarks Preservation\r\nCommission, Bayard D. Evans, Chairman, the predecessor of the present\r\nHistory Commission as the chief historical agency of the County\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nReproduction of the material in this report is invited, subject to the\r\ncustomary credit to author and publisher.\r\n\r\n  John Porter Bloom\r\n  Chairman\r\n  Fairfax County History Commission\r\n\r\n  April 1970\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThese notes are part of a series of research reports on the historic\r\nand architectural landmarks of Fairfax County, Virginia, prepared\r\npursuant to a resolution of the Board of County Supervisors calling\r\nfor a survey of the county's historic sites and buildings.\r\n\r\nGreen Spring Farm was selected in 1967 by the Fairfax County\r\nHistorical Landmarks Preservation Commission as a subject to be\r\nresearched, and was later incorporated into a successor research\r\nprogram sponsored by the Division of Planning in cooperation with the\r\nFairfax County History Commission.\r\n\r\nThe authors of this report wish to acknowledge with special thanks the\r\nassistance of the following: Mr. and Mrs. John Mosby Beattie, Admiral\r\nBeverly Mosby Coleman, Mr. and Mrs. Michael W. Straight, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJohn Quast, Mrs. Victor Fahringer, Mrs. Gwen Hempel, Mrs. Don Ritchie,\r\nand Mrs. Edith Moore Sprouse.\r\n\r\nThe authors also extend their thanks to the Honorable Thomas P.\r\nChapman, former Clerk of the Fairfax County Circuit Court, and the\r\nHonorable Franklin Gooding, present Clerk of the Fairfax County\r\nCircuit Court, for assistance in making available court records of the\r\nclerkships of various members of the Moss family. The Honorable George\r\nR. Rich, Clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates and Keeper of the\r\nRolls of the State, furnished information on Robert Moss's term as a\r\nDelegate from Fairfax County. Thanks are extended to the staff of the\r\nNational Archives who located and made available for examination the\r\nmilitary and civil service records of Fountain Beattie.\r\n\r\nMany helpful suggestions on the interpretation of data concerning the\r\nhistory of agriculture in Northern Virginia were provided by C.\r\nMalcolm Watkins, Chairman of the Department of Cultural History, and\r\nJohn T. Schlebecker, Curator of the Division of Agriculture and Mining\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology.\r\n\r\nDetails of the architectural history of the mansion house were\r\nfurnished by Walter Macomber, who was in charge of the 1942\r\nrenovation, and David Condon, AIA, who designed the additional work\r\ndone in 1960. Mr. Condon also provided both information and\r\narchitectural plans for the Tobey House and the Spring House. The\r\nauthors' sincere thanks are extended to both these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFinally, the authors wish to acknowledge the efficient and valuable\r\nhelp that they, as part of the county's historical research project,\r\nreceived from the staff of the Fairfax County Headquarters Library.\r\n\r\n  N.N.\r\n  R.D.N.\r\n\r\n  Fairfax, Virginia\r\n  April 22, 1970\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land has always had a special value to Virginians. Land was the\r\nfirst form of wealth which the colonists knew; and it was through\r\ncultivation of the land that Virginians first enjoyed the heady\r\nfeeling of prosperity that came with the rise of their tobacco\r\nempire. Ownership and cultivation of the land were the goals of\r\nthose who indentured themselves to come to the New World, and they\r\nwere the foundations on which Jefferson placed his reliance for the\r\nperpetuation of political freedom and economic strength for the\r\ninfant republic which emerged from the Revolution. For more than\r\nthree centuries, Virginians have associated the land with values\r\nwhich are both physical and spiritual.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, the history of Green Spring Farm serves not\r\nonly as a chronicle of the lives of three families who resided there\r\nbut also as a reflection of the history of agriculture in Northern\r\nVirginia. Green Spring Farm was not one of the great estates of\r\nTidewater Virginia. By the mid-eighteenth century, most of the\r\noriginal Northern Neck proprietary grants had been broken up and\r\nreplaced by a pattern of smaller farms whose owners owed no allegiance\r\nto the tobacco empire and were willing to experiment with diversified\r\ncrops. Green Spring Farm illustrated this emerging pattern of\r\nagriculture; and its first owners, John Moss and his heirs, who\r\nassembled the acreage in the 1770's and occupied it until 1839, were\r\ntypical of the freeholder classes who took pride in their land and in\r\nregarding themselves as farmers. Their farming raised Virginia to its\r\nposition of preeminance among the colonies and in the new nation after\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nFarming remained the foundation of Virginia's economy through the\r\nnineteenth century, although changes in the methods of husbandry and\r\ntransportation, together with the opening of farmlands in the Ohio\r\nValley and the prairie states, had important consequences in Virginia.\r\nThese impacts were followed by the devastating years of war from 1861\r\nto 1865. Agriculture in Northern Virginia reached its low point in the\r\n1870's.\r\n\r\nThe period of rebuilding in Northern Virginia--the \"Energetic\r\nEighties,\" as one historian has called these years--brought a revival\r\nof agriculture. Farmers who could no longer compete in one agriculture\r\nmarket shifted to another where they enjoyed natural advantages. Thus,\r\nGreen Spring Farm, under the ownership of Fountain Beattie from 1878\r\nto 1917, became chiefly an orchard and dairy farm.\r\n\r\nUnder the ownership of Michael Straight, from 1942 to the present\r\n(1969), Green Spring Farm came under assault from new economic forces\r\nwhich drastically affected farming in Northern Virginia and ultimately\r\nbrought an end to the agricultural era there. Unlike the changing\r\ntimes of earlier centuries, there was no compromise with the forces of\r\nexpanding urbanization; and, eventually, even stock farming was ended.\r\nYet, in the twentieth century, as in the eighteenth and nineteenth,\r\nthe farm continued to represent values which were social as well as\r\neconomic. The alert eye of a Russian writer catches some of this value\r\nin \"A Visit from Mr. Polevoy,\" reproduced in the appendix, just as the\r\ninventories of the estates of earlier owners of the farm suggest the\r\nsocial values which were held in their times.\r\n\r\nGreen Spring Farm therefore offers insight into the lives of Virginia\r\ngentlemen of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Its\r\nowners were men of learning according to their times, and men of\r\naffairs. The history of the farm records many references to occasions\r\nwhen it was a gathering place for colorful and talented people whose\r\nnames were notable in the arts, literature, sciences, and politics of\r\ntheir day. Throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth\r\ncenturies, its owners were sought for public service and held\r\npositions of trust and responsibility in county, state, and national\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nThe architectural history of Green Spring Farm parallels its chain of\r\ntitle. Both the structure and interior design of its buildings have\r\nundergone numerous alterations and remodelings. None of these changes,\r\nhowever, has destroyed the simple dignity of the house, and it stands\r\ntoday as a symbol of the traditional strength of spirit of the\r\nVirginia freeholder-farmer in an area which is undergoing the\r\ntransition of America's urban revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTES\r\n\r\nI. GENTLEMAN FREEHOLDERS: THE MOSS FAMILY (1770-1835)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Green Spring Farm came into being in the middle years of the\r\neighteenth century, it represented the second generation of Virginia's\r\nagriculture. By 1750, the great plantations of the proprietor and his\r\ngrantees, laid out on land cleared from the virgin forest and planted\r\nwith as much tobacco as the owner's supplies of manpower and London\r\ncredit would allow, were disappearing. In the evolution of farming,\r\nanother generation of farms and farmers was taking over the Tidewater.\r\nSmaller in size than the great tobacco plantations, these farms\r\nutilized a larger proportion of their acreage for crops and cultivated\r\na greater diversity of crops than before. For these second-generation\r\nfarms, wheat and corn for export to England and the West Indies became\r\nthe principal income crops.\r\n\r\nThe men who assembled and worked these new farms were themselves part\r\nof a new generation of Virginians. Many belonged to families which\r\nin 1750 could look back on more than a century of residence in\r\nAmerica, and they were more attuned to the problems and potentials\r\nof the New World than those of the Old. They were the generation\r\nthat successfully brought forth a new nation in their own times and\r\nadded new dimensions to both its spirit and substances. John Moss\r\nwas one of this new generation of Virginians.\r\n\r\nPrecisely when and how John Moss assembled the acreage that comprised\r\nGreen Spring Farm is not certain. Fairfax County land records show a\r\npurchase of land by John Moss in September 1777, but, although this is\r\nthe first connection of his name with the land of Green Spring Farm in\r\nthese records, there is reason to believe that he may have occupied\r\nand farmed the land prior to that date. For him to have done so would\r\nhave been consistent with the practice of his times and also would be\r\nin accord with the tradition of his present-day descendants which\r\nholds that John Moss built the mansion house at Green Spring Farm in\r\nor about 1760.[1]\r\n\r\nJohn Moss lived in this house until his death in 1809. Here he raised\r\nfour sons--John, Samuel, William, and Thomas--the last two of whom\r\nsuccessively inherited and worked the farm from 1809 until 1839. On\r\nthe death of Thomas Moss in 1839, the farm was sold and the proceeds\r\nof the sale were divided among his heirs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1. John Warner Survey Map, 1740. Northern Neck\r\nGrants, Book E, 1736-1742, pp. 216-17.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of John Moss, more is known of his activities in the\r\ncommunity than of his life as a farmer. In particular, he was a leader\r\nof the early Methodist church in Virginia. The well-known itinerant\r\nMethodist preacher, John Littlejohn, records several visits to the\r\nhome of John Moss in Fairfax County, beginning in May 1777. Many\r\nMethodist meetings were held at Green Spring Farm in the 1770's and\r\n1780's. One, held on April 29, 1778, led to the following interesting\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n  At B^r Jn^o Mosses, met with M^r afterward Lord Fairfax we found\r\n  our trials as to preach^g were very similar, he is very serious\r\n  but his religion is a mystry to me. Lord help us both.[2]\r\n\r\nAnd, in 1787, Francis Asbury noted in his journal:\r\n\r\n  Preached at Brother Mosses on 2 Chronicles XV, 12-13 on the\r\n  peoples entering into a covenant with God.[3]\r\n\r\nIt seems evident that during these years, John Moss's home served as a\r\nmeeting place for a Methodist congregation which lacked a church\r\nbuilding and was served by the occasional visits of itinerant\r\npreachers. That the congregation grew and prospered also seems evident\r\nfrom the fact that in June 1789 John Moss served as a trustee of a\r\nMethodist Episcopal church to be built in Alexandria \"just north of\r\nthe Presbyterian Meeting House\" (Duke and Fairfax Streets) for the use\r\nof Reverend Thomas Cooke and Reverend Francis Asbury.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the county community, John Moss also was one of the group of\r\ngentlemen freeholders in whom the responsibility of power was reposed.\r\nHe enjoyed the friendship and trust of Bryan Fairfax to the extent\r\nthat he witnessed and served as coexecutor of the latter's will,[5]\r\nand he was a party to several land sales and leases which involved\r\nFairfax.[6] By these transactions, he acquired extensive lands in\r\nLoudoun County as well as land on Dogue Creek in Fairfax County.[7]\r\n\r\nIn colonial times, he served the Crown as Commissioner of the King's\r\nRevenue in Fairfax County and also as a justice of the County\r\nCourt.[8] In the War for Independence, he served as a captain and\r\nafterward took an active part in organizing the new government--in\r\nparticular, serving on a commission to supervise the Presidential\r\nelection of 1788. Under the new State Government, he continued to\r\nserve as the Commissioner of Revenue for the county and a justice of\r\nthe County Court. In 1796, in a law suit in Prince William County,\r\nJohn Moss, then 72, was able to state that he was the oldest justice\r\nof the court in commission at that time.[9]\r\n\r\nService as a justice presumably involved John Moss in a wide range of\r\ndecisions affecting the life of the county. The business of the County\r\nCourt in this period was both judicial and administrative. Minor\r\ncrimes were disposed of monthly, while major crimes and civil cases\r\nwere handled in quarterly sessions.[10] At these sessions, the\r\njustices also acted on appointments, licenses for mills and\r\nordinaries, road construction and repair, and the levying of taxes.\r\nMost of the justices were not trained in the law, and law books were\r\nscarce; therefore, the quality of justice and the transaction of\r\npublic business were frequently leavened by reliance on common sense\r\nand experience.[11]\r\n\r\nIf gentlemen freeholders held the power of government in colonial and\r\npost-Revolutionary Virginia, they also paid much of the cost of\r\ngovernment. In 1786, John Moss and James Wren, Gentlemen, were\r\nappointed Commissioners of the Land Tax, the large counties in\r\nVirginia being allowed to have two such officials.[12] They were\r\nresponsible for maintaining the tax book, personally calling on every\r\nperson subject to taxation, and making four lists of taxable property\r\nin the county. (One was for the Clerk of the County Court, one for the\r\nsheriff, one for the Solicitor General, and one for the commissioner.)\r\nAnnually, they submitted a list of changes in land ownership, by sale\r\nor inheritance.[13]\r\n\r\nFor his service as a justice and as Commissioner of the Land Tax, John\r\nMoss's compensation came in the form of fees; he received no salary\r\nbut under certain circumstances he was reimbursed for out-of-pocket\r\nexpenses connected with his duties.[14]\r\n\r\nAs one of the results of the American Revolution, the Anglican church\r\nwas disestablished, and many of the welfare functions formerly\r\nperformed by the parish vestry were assumed by the Overseers of the\r\nPoor. John Moss served as an overseer, and the powers and duties he\r\nhad in this unusual office were set forth in detail in the revision of\r\nthe state laws in 1792.[15] Overseers could prevent the poor from\r\nmoving from one county to another and could get a warrant from any\r\nmagistrate ordering the removal of a pauper back to his former county,\r\nwith a court hearing to determine residence in case of a dispute. On\r\nthe other hand, each county was obliged, through its overseers, to\r\nlook after its own poor; and if the overseers refused to provide\r\nneeded relief, there could be an appeal to the County Court.[16]\r\n\r\nFurther, they could bind out dependent children placed under their\r\ncare as apprentices, appoint collectors-for-the-poor rates, have a\r\npaid clerk, and be paid for attending meetings. They had power to\r\ncontrol vagrants, force fathers of bastards to contribute to their\r\nsupport, and operate the county poorhouse. In 1806, they were given\r\nthe power to take over funds and endowments left in the charge of the\r\nvestries, accounting to the court annually.[17]\r\n\r\nJohn Moss served as justice of the County Court until his death, and\r\nso saw the time come when the county courthouse was moved from\r\nAlexandria to its present site. His view of the history of his county,\r\nstate, and nation saw more than mere physical change, however, and he\r\nwas sensitive to the changing spirit of the time and place in which he\r\nlived. As to the depth of this feeling, there is no evidence in the\r\nform of public document or speech; but eloquent testimony comes from a\r\nsimple, personal act he performed in 1795. As recorded in a deed of\r\nmanumission issued to his slaves, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  I, John Moss ... being fully satisfied that it is contrary to our\r\n  bill of rights as well as to our principles and sentiments as a\r\n  free people and also contrary to common justice to hold and keep\r\n  in a state of slavery any part of our fellow men ... [release and\r\n  set free at various specified times from the date of this deed]\r\n  Sarah, Nan, Harry, Maria, Hannah, Nero, Abram, Fox, Nat, David,\r\n  John, Sam, Milla and Sal....[18]\r\n\r\nThe tradition of public service which John Moss commenced was carried\r\non by his son, William Moss, who was appointed Clerk of the County\r\nCourt in 1801. The duties of the clerk at this time differed somewhat\r\nfrom those of the clerk in colonial times. As enumerated in the\r\ngeneral revision of the law in 1792,[19] the clerk must be a resident\r\nof the county and keep his office in the courthouse, unless ordered to\r\ndo otherwise. He received his compensation in small fees charged for\r\nperforming small acts, but in a growing county this produced a\r\nsubstantial income. His chief functions involved issuing licenses,\r\nwarrants, writs, and orders connected with litigation. He also took\r\ninventories, recorded legal instruments, and kept vital statistics.\r\nFrequently, the clerk was the only officer of the court who was in any\r\nway learned in the law, and thus his advice on the law was regularly\r\nsought by the court. As the information he gave frequently was\r\nseasoned with experience, he became sought after for advice on many\r\nissues and problems which reached beyond the technical terms of the\r\nlaw, and his importance in the county's government was substantial.\r\n\r\nWilliam Moss served as Clerk of the County Court for 32 years, until\r\n1833. In 1831, he was appointed Clerk of the Circuit Court, when that\r\nbody was created by the General Assembly, and he served in that\r\nposition until 1835, the year of his death. At this time, William\r\nMoss's brother, Thomas, who had served as a Delegate from Fairfax\r\nCounty to the Virginia General Assembly in 1828, was appointed to fill\r\nthe vacancy left by William's death. When Thomas Moss died in 1839,\r\nhis son, Alfred, was appointed Clerk but served in that office only\r\none month. Later, however, Alfred Moss moved from Alexandria to\r\nProvidence [Fairfax] where in 1852 he was again appointed Clerk of the\r\nCircuit Court. He served in this capacity until 1861, at which time\r\nCivil War activities in the area disrupted the normal conduct of\r\ncounty business.[20] It was at this time that Alfred Moss removed\r\nGeorge Washington's holographic will from Fairfax Courthouse to take\r\nit to Richmond for safekeeping for the duration of the war. Because\r\nthere was considerable risk in getting it to Richmond, Alfred's wife,\r\nMartha Gunnell Moss, hid it for a time in her daughter's home,\r\n\"Evergreen,\" in Fauquier County. Alfred Moss was captured and sent to\r\nCapitol Prison, and when he was released by exchange, he took the will\r\nto a safe place. Shortly after the war, the Fairfax County Court sent\r\na private citizen, O. W. Hunt, to Richmond where he found the\r\nWashington will, some other papers, and the County Seal, which he\r\nreturned to the Fairfax Courthouse where they may be seen during\r\nregular hours of business.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN COLONIAL VIRGINIA. The lands which were assembled by\r\nJohn Moss to comprise his farm were quite different from the virgin\r\nforest land that was being opened up for cultivation in the western\r\npart of Fairfax and in Loudoun County at about the same time. Like\r\nmost of the open land below the fall line, the tract which Moss\r\nassembled had first played a part in the tobacco civilization that had\r\ndominated the life of Northern Virginia from 1650 to 1750.[22] During\r\nthe eighteenth century, tobacco planters of the Virginia Tidewater\r\nhad turned inland, clearing the forested area of the Piedmont to bring\r\nvirgin land into production of their crop. Their actions were the\r\nresult of many contributing causes--the tendency of tobacco to wear\r\nout the soil, the need for timberland to supply the rising demand for\r\nbarrels and hogsheads, the introduction of new implements of\r\nhusbandry, the plentiful supply of enslaved or indentured labor, and,\r\nof course, the presence of cheap land in the western part of the\r\ncounty.[23]\r\n\r\nExpansion required capital, however, and many of the Tidewater tobacco\r\nplanters whose holdings had been created through proprietary grants\r\nobtained the necessary funds by selling off portions of their\r\nTidewater holdings. By the middle of the eighteenth century, few of\r\nthe large land grants remained intact and what remained to the\r\noriginal owners was interspersed with smaller farms and old fields\r\ngradually being taken over by scrub pine.[24] At the same time, the\r\nincrease of warehouses and riverside facilities, the growth of roads\r\noverland between the principal river landings and the gaps in the Blue\r\nRidge Mountains, and a steadily rising number of tradesmen and\r\nartisans setting out for themselves upon completion of their indenture\r\nperiods all combined to offer a prospect of success, if not affluence,\r\nto one who was willing to work the land diligently and prudently.\r\n\r\nMany of the small farmers of the Tidewater remained as committed\r\nto tobacco as the great planters had been. Others turned to\r\ndiversification of crops. Corn (maize) was grown in conjunction with\r\ntobacco from the beginning of settlement in Northern Virginia and\r\ndiversification simply called for increasing its role. In the\r\neighteenth century, wheat was introduced as a substitute for tobacco\r\nto restore the land and gradually became adopted in place of tobacco\r\nas a farm staple. As commercial relations with England became more\r\ndifficult after 1750, and were completely disrupted during the War\r\nfor Independence, tobacco planters in great numbers shifted to\r\nproduction of foodstuffs to meet domestic demands. The description of\r\nWashington's experience at Mount Vernon, only a few miles distant\r\nfrom Green Spring Farm, may be taken as typical of that of his\r\nneighbors:\r\n\r\n  On the thin topsoil that overlay the clay slopes at Mount Vernon,\r\n  George Washington grew wheat that sold in Alexandria, made ship's\r\n  biscuit that was famous the world over--and rye that supplied his\r\n  less celebrated distillery. The increasing number of cattle\r\n  accounted for the introduction of mangel-wurzels, turnips, and\r\n  other root crops in the rotation. The soil-building virtues of\r\n  peas were discovered. Beef cattle grew in increasing numbers, and\r\n  began to appear prominently in inventories and wills. Orchards and\r\n  vineyards were planted more widely. With these developments,\r\n  simultaneously with the decline of the tobacco trade, a lively\r\n  business sprang up in shipping corn, wheat, and livestock to the\r\n  West Indies....[25]\r\n\r\nIn his efforts to develop methods of husbandry which would restore the\r\nfertility of the land, Washington reflected a concern which was\r\nwidespread among Virginians of his time and the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century. Organized efforts to promote better husbandry\r\nthrough exchange of practical experience and dissemination of the\r\nresults of experimentation and invention began in the 1770's.[26]\r\nBetween 1790 and 1830, hundreds of publications on agriculture were\r\nproduced[27] and more than 100 inventions of agricultural devices were\r\npatented to Virginians, among them Cyrus McCormick's reaper, the most\r\ninfluential mechanical factor in the development of American\r\nagriculture in the nineteenth century.[28] National leaders such as\r\nThomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Marshall actively worked in\r\nsocieties which encouraged experimentation and study for improvement\r\nof agriculture through what was called \"scientific farming.\"\r\n\r\nWith the effort to establish scientific farming came experiments in\r\ncrop rotation, with use of clovers and grasses interspersed between\r\nother crops, increased use of manure and artificial fertilizers,\r\nbetter plows and methods of soil preparation, and more attention to\r\ncontrol of erosion. Interest in improving farm animals during this\r\nperiod led to introduction of merino sheep and new breeds of mules.\r\n\r\nDespite this active element in Virginia's agricultural system, and\r\nnotwithstanding the substantial amount of intelligent and successful\r\nexperimentation and publicity of results which this element inspired,\r\nmany farmers in Virginia persisted in traditional ways. \"Book\r\nfarming,\" as the new methods were called, was decried in favor of the\r\nfamiliar ways of cultivating which were passed from father to son.\r\nThis skepticism was strengthened, also, when experiments failed--as\r\nthey did in many cases--and when Virginia agriculture suffered from\r\neconomic depression along with the rest of the nation--as it did in\r\nthe years following the War of 1812.[29]\r\n\r\nWhile Virginia agriculture had an equivocal or only moderately\r\nsuccessful record of growth from 1750 to 1830, the proponents of\r\nscientific farming could and did argue that its value was measured in\r\npolitical as well as economic terms. Men like Thomas Jefferson, James\r\nMadison, John Taylor, James Garnett, and others sincerely believed\r\nthat the survival of their way of life and that which they sought for\r\nVirginia depended on restoring the farmer to preeminence. One\r\nhistorian has described their philosophy thus:\r\n\r\n  The sincerity of their belief in the corruption of urban and the\r\n  virtue of rural living is unquestionable. They practiced as they\r\n  preached. And as they looked about them, at the long line of\r\n  Virginia leaders of the early republic and at their own modest\r\n  pleasant way of life, which some of them believed extended all the\r\n  way down to their slaves, they felt they had incontestable\r\n  evidence of the rightness of their convictions. As their soil\r\n  became depleted, the hold of their state on preeminence in\r\n  everything was weakening. Restore the soil and Virginia would be\r\n  restored to her rightful preeminence. Simple, primitive, noble,\r\n  limited yet grand, thus went the conception.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOSS FAMILY AS FARMERS. Whether John Moss and his descendants who\r\ninherited and worked Green Spring Farm were \"scientific farmers\"\r\naccording to the standards of the time is not certain. Presumably they\r\nwere aware of the organizations which espoused this cause since they\r\nwere active in the public life of their state and community. They may\r\nwell have read the writings of some of the scientific farming leaders\r\nof the time, such as John Taylor, who wrote under the pseudonym,\r\n\"Arator,\" and whose articles on agriculture were published in a\r\nGeorgetown newspaper commencing in 1810.[31]\r\n\r\nAn inventory of the personal property of William Moss, made in\r\nconnection with an auction to settle up his estate in 1835, offers\r\nindirect evidence of the farming methods of the Moss family. (A copy\r\nof this inventory is contained in appendix D.)\r\n\r\nThe lack of tobacco and tobacco processing equipment suggests that the\r\nMosses had abandoned this crop for production of cereal grains--wheat,\r\noats, rye, and corn--and possession of a mechanical wheat fan (for\r\nblowing chaff away from the grain during threshing) indicates use of\r\nsome of the most advanced labor-saving equipment of the day.[32] The\r\nnumber of horses, plows, and other farm machinery seems large for the\r\nsize of the farm and suggests that its cultivation must have prospered\r\nover a period of time. Particularly significant is the number of\r\nlivestock in the inventory and the types of animals--horses, cattle,\r\nhogs, sheep, and bees. These, plus other entries, indicate that the\r\nfarm must have regularly produced beef, bacon, lard, wool, soap,\r\nhoney, and beeswax, all in quantities sufficient to provide market\r\nincome. Mention of quantities of hay, oats, and corn in the inventory\r\nsuggest that in addition to cultivating cereal grains the Mosses had a\r\nmajor interest in raising meat animals and in dairying.\r\n\r\nStrong evidence of dairying comes from the presence of a spring house\r\nat the farm and mention of tubs, churns, jars, crocks, strainers, and\r\nthe like. They point to active dairying, with the sale of milk,\r\ncheese, and butter in the nearby neighborhood, in Alexandria, and\r\npossibly even points beyond.[33]\r\n\r\nThe listing of hogsheads and barrels of vinegar in the sale inventory\r\nsuggests still another facet of Green Spring Farm's diversification.\r\nBoth apple and peach orchards existed at the time and apparently\r\nproduced well.[34]\r\n\r\nThe will of John Moss and the inventories of William Moss and Thomas\r\nMoss give the impression of a farming family which was successful in\r\nmore than ordinary measure as compared with most other Northern\r\nVirginia farmers. Their farm was described in the notice advertising\r\nthe court sale in 1839 as follows:\r\n\r\n  Brick dwelling house, 8 rooms, brick kitchen, meat house,\r\n  servant's house, new barn and stables and other convenient\r\n  outbuildings. Apple orchard, peach orchard, also, stone spring\r\n  house.[35]\r\n\r\nMore revealing, perhaps, is the affidavit of Alfred Moss and Thomas\r\nLove (son and son-in-law, respectively, of Thomas Moss) offered in\r\nconnection with the court proceedings to sell the farm as part of the\r\nsettlement of Thomas Moss's estate. They said:\r\n\r\n  This tract of land is naturally a thin soil, but from a careful\r\n  course of husbandry for a number of years is now in a good state\r\n  of cultivation, the fields well enclosed by good and substantial\r\n  fencing, the land not in cultivation well taken with grass (clover\r\n  and timothy), and that in cultivation just sown down in winter\r\n  grain, and the buildings in a good state of repair, the barn and\r\n  stables having been erected in the last two or three years.[36]\r\n\r\nAlthough the history of Green Spring Farm during its ownership by the\r\nMoss family does not contain evidence of agricultural experimentation\r\nand leadership in scientific farming, it seems clear, on the other\r\nhand, that John Moss and his descendants advanced with the progress of\r\ntheir times and, indeed, may have been among the most progressive\r\nhusbandmen of their day. They had broken away from the pattern of\r\nfarming that typified the colonial tobacco era, and they exemplified a\r\nnew and successful type of agriculture based on careful management of\r\nthe land and production for a diversified market. They were certainly\r\naware of the new developments and new philosophy which were growing\r\nout of the search for the principles of scientific farming, and they\r\naccepted and used some of those that applied to their situation.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN SPRING FARM AND THE TURNPIKE ROAD. The successful operation of\r\nGreen Spring Farm, like the success of numerous other farms in\r\nNorthern Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley, was closely linked to the\r\ntransportation system of these areas. Tidewater Virginia in the\r\nseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries relied mainly on coastal\r\nwaterways and rivers as avenues of commerce and travel. When roads\r\nappeared on maps of Virginia in this period, they followed trails laid\r\ndown by Indians who, in turn, had taken over the game trails along the\r\nridges of the land. Therefore, by 1750 there was only a basic network\r\nof roadways running east-west to the passes in the Blue Ridge and\r\nnorth-south to the colonial capital of Williamsburg along the\r\nTidewater and to the Carolinas through the Piedmont. The eighteenth\r\ncentury development of roads in Northern Virginia emphasized east-west\r\ntravel for the obvious reason that residents of this area saw their\r\nfuture prosperity more closely linked to the rich resources and\r\nfertile lands of the Shenandoah Valley (and through it, perhaps, to\r\nthe Ohio River) than through connection with the political capitals of\r\nthe state or the great plantations of the James and York Rivers.[38]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2. Survey Map, John Halley, 1840. Fairfax County\r\nDeed Book H-3, p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3. R. R. Farr Survey, Fairfax County Deed Book C-8,\r\np. 448.]\r\n\r\nAs Colchester and Dumfries yielded leadership in commerce to\r\nAlexandria and as Loudoun and Fauquier Counties developed centers of\r\ncommerce and seats of government at Leesburg and Warrenton, the desire\r\nfor better overland connections with Alexandria gained strength.\r\nPublic roadbuilding in this period was treated with indifference by\r\nboth public officials and the public at large. Theoretically carried\r\nout by levying a certain amount of labor or materials from the\r\nfreeholders of the community, the system never produced good roads in\r\nNorthern Virginia; and, in the early nineteenth century, overland\r\ntravel generally had permitted them to deteriorate to the point where\r\nboth foreign and domestic travelers commented unfavorably on them in\r\ntheir travel memoirs.[39] Moreover, in the 1800's, the new state\r\ngovernments were in no position to provide financial support for local\r\npublic works and could offer nothing more than their moral support\r\nthrough legislative approval of private roadbuilding by private\r\nturnpike companies which raised their capital through the sale of\r\nstock and obtained their income by charging tolls for use of the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe earliest private turnpike company charter issued by the Virginia\r\nLegislature was in 1795 for the \"Fairfax and Loudoun Road\" from\r\nAlexandria to the ford of Little River. This company was never\r\norganized, but, in 1802, a somewhat more liberal charter was given to\r\nthe Little River Turnpike Company. This company's road was completed\r\nin 1806 and immediately led to enactment in 1808 of further\r\nlegislation authorizing extensions to Fauquier Courthouse.[40]\r\n\r\nThe Little River Turnpike was located so that Fairfax Courthouse stood\r\napproximately half way between Alexandria and the western terminus at\r\nAldie. The courthouse thus served as a logical landmark dividing the\r\nupper and lower segments of the road. The turnpike traversed Green\r\nSpring Farm at a point about midway in its lower section. Throughout\r\nthe history of the road, the Moss family appears to have been deeply\r\ninvolved. In 1809, William Moss was appointed and served as one of\r\nthree commissioners to advertise and receive subscriptions for stock\r\nin the company constructing the road from the Little River Turnpike to\r\nFauquier Courthouse.[41]\r\n\r\nThomas Moss served as a director of the Little River Turnpike Company\r\nand also acted as superintendent of the lower district of the road.\r\nFinancial statements of the company, which were given in the annual\r\nreports of the State Board of Public Works, regularly carried accounts\r\nfor both the salary paid to Thomas Moss and the funds spent by him for\r\nrepair of the lower section of the road.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDCENTURY YEARS. 1840-1880. The Moss family's ownership of Green\r\nSpring Farm ended in 1843 with the sale of the farm and division of\r\nthe proceeds among the eight heirs of Thomas Moss.[43] Under the\r\nsupervision of the County Court, the farm was sold to one Thomas\r\nSheriff, lately of Barbados. On his death, it descended to his son,\r\nJames Sheriff, who kept it until 1855 when he transferred it as part\r\nof a settlement for a debt. Its next owner was James Benton, who held\r\nit in trust for one Hannah O'Brien of Baltimore. In the first half of\r\nthis period the times were generally good. Virginia agriculture grew\r\nto new levels of prosperity, aided by the introduction of new\r\nlabor-saving machinery through inventions and the opening up of new\r\nmarkets for farm produce through improvements in transportation. In\r\nsuch circumstances, James Sheriff's loss of Green Spring Farm for\r\ndebts in 1855 seems likely to have been due to exceptional misfortunes\r\nor else exceptional neglect and waste on the part of the owner.\r\nAlthough records of the County Court during this period suggest that\r\nThomas Sheriff and his son, James, were before the Bar of Justice on\r\nnumerous occasions, these references do not suffice to explain all\r\nthat occurred.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of this period, when title to the farm was in\r\nJames Benton for the use of Hannah O'Brien, the fortunes of its owners\r\nwere dictated mainly by the fortunes of war. During the four years of\r\nhostilities, Green Spring Farm stood in the disputed ground outside\r\nthe perimeter of permanent defenses of the capital where patrols from\r\nboth sides ranged regularly by day and night. While the records of the\r\nwar do not report any major engagements at the farm, they indicate\r\nthat military activity in the neighborhood frequently placed its\r\nsafety in jeopardy and obviously prevented any regular farming\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate loss of the farm in 1878--again to be sold for\r\ndebt--appears to have been the result of imprudence in business\r\ndealings (according to local tradition, Hannah's husband, Matthew\r\nO'Brien, was a gambler), and inability to bring the farm back from the\r\nlow state to which it was reduced during the war years.\r\n\r\nHannah O'Brien's interest in the farm enjoyed the special protection\r\nof a deed which specified that the land should be free from debts,\r\nliabilities, and control of her husband, Matthew O'Brien, and that she\r\nhad power to dispose of the property by deed in her own right.[44]\r\nSubsequently, however, through ignorance or bad advice, she signed as\r\nguarantor of a note issued by her husband; and, when default on the\r\nnote occurred, she lost the farm through court proceedings which\r\nordered it sold for the debt.[45] Thus, in 1878 the farm was bought by\r\nFountain Beattie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Dr. Schlebecker was\r\n        of the opinion that the price which this blower brought\r\n        suggested it might be animal-powered by a treadmill or\r\n        overhead sweep. Wheat fans were relatively new types of\r\n        equipment in 1835, but not uncommon among successful farmers.\r\n\r\n   [33] _Ibid._ Schlebecker discussed the possibility of dairying as\r\n        follows: \"It's very likely he was in the business. Now whether\r\n        it was butter or cheese--butter would pay better, and he is\r\n        pretty close to Alexandria and Washington, and, for that\r\n        matter, by sea to Baltimore. Butter would have been the more\r\n        attractive of the commodities; cheese would keep better, could\r\n        be shipped farther and find a greater variety of markets, but\r\n        wouldn't pay quite as well. But I don't see evidence he was in\r\n        the cheese business, and I'd be happier if I saw more churns\r\n        on the list, or if the churn were better described. One churn\r\n        would be enough if it were big enough. And it could very well\r\n        be run by a sheep or a dog. You see, he's certainty got enough\r\n        cows to be in the dairy business, willy nilly.\" (Transcription\r\n        of tape-recorded interview with John Schlebecker, February 26,\r\n        1969, p. 6.)\r\n\r\n   [34] _Ibid._ See also inventory in appendix B.\r\n\r\n   [35] _Alexandria Gazette_, November 6, 1839, notice of sale.\r\n\r\n   [36] Alfred Moss and Thomas Love, affidavit of October 29, 1839, in\r\n        proceedings to sell the farm owned by Thomas Moss, deceased.\r\n\r\n   [37] The wills and property inventories of members of the Moss family\r\n        reveal much information that helps reconstruct the activity on\r\n        their farm. Considering the equipment used, the products grown\r\n        and processed, and the number of slaves reported, it is\r\n        possible that between the 1820's and 1850's the farm was also\r\n        engaged in breeding slaves for export to the rice and indigo\r\n        plantations of South Carolina and the cotton plantations of\r\n        Alabama and Mississippi.

ORCHARD AND DAIRY: FOUNTAIN BEATTIE (1878-1917)\r\n\r\nNORTHERN VIRGINIA'S AGRICULTURE IN THE 1870'S. By 1870, Virginia\r\nfarmers were beginning to recover from the recent war which had\r\ncompletely disrupted normal agricultural activity. The effects of\r\nthe war had been felt keenly in Northern Virginia where the\r\nconflict had not been marked by many of the major battles but had\r\nnevertheless afflicted the area with four years of constant\r\nraiding and skirmishing. The resultant toll of horses, mules, cattle,\r\nand livestock and the dearth of farm machinery were major handicaps\r\nfacing the farmer, as were his lack of capital with which to purchase\r\nsupplies and equipment from outside his area and the general\r\nshortage of labor.[46] These shortages were overcome slowly. Some\r\nmaterials for beginning to rebuild the war damage were readily\r\navailable from military supplies immediately after the close of\r\nhostilities; and, in this respect, Northern Virginia was fortunate\r\nto be within a few miles of the Union Army supply depots in\r\nAlexandria and Washington, D.C. But, as the confused era of\r\nreconstruction set in, the farmer was thrown mainly on his own\r\nresources of land and labor to rebuild his fortunes.\r\n\r\nPoor as his prospects might seem to be, the Northern Virginia farmer\r\nhad certain advantages that farmers in other parts of the state\r\nlacked. The farmland was by no means barren or exhausted, although it\r\nhad been worked steadily during the previous decade when all efforts\r\nturned to producing the maximum amount of food for subsistence and no\r\nthought could be given to maintaining or enhancing the fertility of\r\nthe soil.[47] Also, Fairfax County farmers had relatively easy access\r\nto the produce markets of Washington and Baltimore, both by water and\r\noverland transportation.[48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4. Hopkins' Atlas Map, 1879.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, agriculture in Northern Virginia had not been dominated by\r\nthe plantation system since the mid-eighteenth century. By 1870, even\r\nthe great landholdings which had been carved out of the original\r\nproprietary grants had given way to a third generation of farms, still\r\nsmaller in size and more diversified. While the owners of these\r\nNorthern Virginia farms had, in many instances, owned slaves before\r\nthe war, their dependence on this source of labor was not as critical\r\nas in other parts of Virginia--notably, the regions where tobacco was\r\nking. Thus, when the \"great political convulsion which culminated in\r\nthe disruption of the labor system of the State\"[49] compelled\r\nSouthern farmers generally to rebuild their system with different\r\nforms of labor and land tenure, Fairfax County farmers found\r\nthemselves able to adjust to the new circumstances with relative ease\r\nonce they were able to acquire tools and livestock. At this time, as\r\nbefore the war, they benefited greatly from the presence among them of\r\na group of thrifty and industrious farm families who migrated from New\r\nYork and New Jersey, bringing with them new energy, new capital, and\r\nnew methods of farming from the diversified agricultural regions of\r\nthe North.[50]\r\n\r\nIn addition, there was abroad in Virginia in 1870 a strong spirit for\r\nrevival of its agriculture, looking not only to securing the\r\nadvantages which scientific husbandry could bring through restored\r\nfertility of the soil but also to realization of the Jeffersonian\r\ndream of a strong, stable, and independent class of American yeomanry\r\nowning and working its own land.[51] Soon after the commencement of\r\nreconstruction, organizations patterned after the various scientific\r\nfarming societies of the 1830's began to appear and agricultural\r\nnewspapers, such as _The Southern Farmer_, resumed publication and\r\ncirculation in Northern Virginia. These two sources called strongly\r\nfor Virginia farmers to change their traditional ways of farming for\r\nmodern methods and modern farm implements.[52] As the 1870's\r\nadvanced, these sources were joined by the State Government, which\r\nprovided a certain amount of assistance for modernization of\r\nVirginia agriculture.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSBY'S LIEUTENANT. It was in this setting that Fountain Beattie\r\nbecame the owner of Green Spring Farm in June 1878 when he purchased\r\nthe 339-acre tract through a commissioner's deed approved by the\r\nCounty Court.[54]\r\n\r\nFountain Beattie was the son of Colonel Robert Beattie and Pauline\r\nWhite Beattie of Chilhowie in Washington County, Virginia. In 1861, he\r\nenlisted in the First Virginia Cavalry at Abingdon and there made the\r\nacquaintance of John S. Mosby. They became good friends, and when\r\nMosby received his separate command, he took Beattie with him.[55]\r\nDuring the next three years, Beattie rode with Mosby in campaigns that\r\ncrossed and recrossed Northern Virginia.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5. c. 1885, Fountain Beattie and Annie Hathaway\r\nBeattie.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mosby and Beattie Families, c. 1890]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Stone Spring House]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lane to Green Spring Farm]\r\n\r\nWhether Fountain Beattie saw or visited Green Spring Farm during these\r\nrides with Mosby's battalion is not certain. There is reason to think\r\nhe may have been in the neighborhood because of references to\r\nengagements at such places as \"Billy Gooding's tavern on the Little\r\nRiver Turnpike, 10 miles from Alexandria.\"[57] Moreover, he may\r\nhave heard of the farm from one of the descendants of its owners,\r\nsince on one occasion he escaped imminent disaster only through the\r\nintervention of one Thomas Moss of Alexandria.[58]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the region must have made a strong impression on\r\nhim because, after moving several times in the years following the\r\nwar, it was in Fairfax County that Fountain Beattie and his family\r\nfinally settled. Money for the purchase of Green Spring Farm in 1878\r\ncame from Mrs. Beattie's inheritance following the sale of \"Western\r\nView,\" the homestead of her deceased parents, located in Fauquier\r\nCounty.[59] At that time, Green Spring Farm was available for purchase\r\nthrough the County Court, which had ordered it sold to satisfy the\r\njudgment for debt against Matthew O'Brien.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD AND DAIRY. Fountain Beattie's selection of Green Spring Farm\r\nappears to have been made with an eye to its proximity to the Little\r\nRiver Turnpike and the old Columbia Turnpike (now Route 712).\r\nIncreasingly, the farmers of the Piedmont region of Virginia were\r\nfeeling the competition of farmers in the Shenandoah Valley and\r\noutside the state in the production of wheat and corn. This\r\ncompetition was made possible when railroads connected the Valley of\r\nVirginia and the farmlands of the great midwestern prairie states with\r\nthe markets of the eastern cities. Farmers in the middle and Northern\r\nVirginia no longer enjoyed the advantages they once had in shipping\r\nwheat and corn to these markets.[61] More and more in the last quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century, Northern Virginia farmers planted corn,\r\nwheat, and other grains for use as livestock feed rather than sale in\r\nthe grain market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6. John Singleton Mosby.]\r\n\r\nLike many other Fairfax County farmers, Fountain Beattie found that he\r\nwas better off to abandon diversified farming in favor of crops with\r\nrespect to which he still enjoyed natural advantages. Thus, during the\r\nlast quarter of the nineteenth century, Green Spring Farm is\r\nidentified with dairy products and orchard and garden produce--all\r\ncommodities which had to be marketed the same day they were produced\r\nor picked or which could be made into derivative products which could\r\nbe easily transported to market and sold at prices which reflected\r\nvalue added by processing. Transportation, however, was a key factor.\r\nVirginia's country roads were publicly acknowledged to be in a\r\n\"lamentable condition,\" and over even the best of them travel often\r\nwas impossible in wet seasons of the year.[62] In this respect, the\r\nLittle River Turnpike was one of the best of Virginia's rural roads,\r\nhaving been laid out and constructed by professional engineers and\r\nmaintained by hired labor with even more care and regularity than the\r\npublic roads. In Beattie's day, as in Moss's time, the turnpike was\r\nthe main road between Alexandria and Fairfax, the county seat, and\r\nthence to the Valley.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations led Fountain Beattie to direct his main\r\neffort to expansion of the orchards and herd of dairy cattle as\r\nrapidly as it was feasible. Year around, the farm was a busy place,\r\nwith work enough for all of the Beatties' 12 children--six boys and\r\nsix girls--as well as their parents and hired hands. Daily chores,\r\nincluding milking and churning, went on all year, for the farm\r\ngenerally had numerous cows, horses, and mules. There was also a\r\ncertain amount of grain to be raised each year for livestock feed, and\r\na large vegetable garden. Fruit trees included pears, cherries, and\r\napples in two 25-acre orchards--one located on each side of the\r\nTurnpike--which provided the principal produce of the farm. Farm\r\nproduce was regularly marketed in Washington, Alexandria, and local\r\ngrocery stores, as well as at a roadside stand during the harvest\r\nseason.[63]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reunion at Manassas: Colonel John S. Mosby visits Bull Run\r\nfor the first time since the war. Pictured are (left to right) Fountain\r\nBeattie, Lycurgus Hutchison, John Mosby, and George Turberville.]\r\n\r\nThe markets of Washington were only about nine miles from Green Spring\r\nFarm, but on market days it was customary for the farm wagons of the\r\nneighborhood to be loaded and on the road well before dawn. The\r\nWashington city wholesale market opened at 3 A.M. each weekday, and\r\nfarmers who came there sold directly from their wagons or from stalls\r\nto a milling crowd of brokers, wholesalers, retail grocers, hotelmen,\r\nand boardinghouse keepers. Most produce was sold by 7 A.M. and the\r\nfarmer who did not sell out by that time generally had to sell at a\r\nsacrifice price or else remain in the market throughout the day,\r\nselling at retail to customers who attended the market later in the\r\nday.[64] With luck, therefore, the market produce farmer from Northern\r\nVirginia might expect to be on his way home by noon.\r\n\r\nNot all of Fountain Beattie's orchard produce, however, went to the\r\nmarket in this way. The spring house on the farm contained presses,\r\nstorage facilities, and other equipment needed to make apple cider,\r\napplejack, and apple and peach brandy. Apples picked in the ripening\r\nseason were stored in large barrels until the fall and winter months,\r\nat which time they were made into fermented or distilled beverages.\r\nAccording to his descendants, Beattie operated a licensed distillery\r\nand made brandies at the farm.\r\n\r\nBeattie's livestock operations at the farm ended in tragedy one day\r\nwhen he returned home to find that his barn had caught fire and been\r\ncompletely destroyed. The contents of the barn, which included all of\r\nhis livestock and much of the farm equipment, were also lost. Only the\r\nhorse he was riding at the time remained to start rebuilding the farm.\r\nAs matters turned out, too much had been lost; Fountain Beattie never\r\ndid more than acquire a few horses to perform the most necessary\r\ntasks. The dairy herds and field crops were never developed to the\r\nthriving level of activity which typified the 1880's and 1890's.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE. The close association of Fountain Beattie\r\nand John S. Mosby during the war years (1861-65) lasted through the\r\nyears of peace that followed. The two men apparently thought alike in\r\npolitical matters; and, in the election of 1872, they campaigned for\r\nGeneral Grant. Shortly afterward, Beattie was appointed Deputy\r\nCollector of Internal Revenue for the Sixth District of Virginia.\r\nFollowing Hayes' election as President, Mosby received an appointment\r\nas Consul in Hong Kong where he served until 1885.[66]\r\n\r\nFountain Beattie's record with the Internal Revenue Service shows that\r\nhe served from 1875 to 1914 and suggests that he settled in or near\r\nAlexandria several years before he purchased Green Spring Farm.[67]\r\nHe was reappointed in 1885 following the brief return of the\r\nDemocratic Party to power under Grover Cleveland's administration.\r\nBeattie's official file in the Treasury Department's personnel records\r\nis a resume of basic statistics--dates of appointments, promotions,\r\noaths of office, and salaries.\r\n\r\nAlthough Northern Virginia seemed to be little affected by events on\r\nthe national and world stage at this time, it was on the move in its\r\nown way. In Beattie's time this region became linked to other major\r\nregions by the coming of the Southern Railway system; and the advent\r\nof the high-speed electric commuter train and its network of tracks\r\ncommenced the inexorable process of creating the interdependent\r\neconomic unity of Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. These were\r\nalso the years of \"Jackson City\" in Arlington, and the crusade of law\r\nenforcement aimed at cleaning up this center of gambling, drinking,\r\nand general sinfulness.[68]\r\n\r\nFor Fountain Beattie, these years of Federal service must have brought\r\nback memories of his war years with Mosby. Although he carried on his\r\nduties as tax collector from an office in the Alexandria Post Office,\r\nhe continued to live at Green Spring Farm and he regularly traversed\r\nroads and places he had visited as a soldier. When Mosby returned from\r\nhis tour as Consul in Hong Kong and became an attorney for the Justice\r\nDepartment, he and Beattie apparently saw a great deal of each other\r\nand their friendship extended to their families who also frequently\r\nexchanged visits. Beattie named one of his sons after his friend, and\r\nJohn Mosby Beattie recalls these times with feelings of fondness.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN SPRING FARM AND ANNANDALE. When Beattie purchased Green Spring\r\nFarm, the activity on the farm was oriented toward the markets of\r\nGeorgetown, Alexandria, Washington, and Baltimore. The community of\r\nAnnandale, a little over two miles up the Little River Turnpike to the\r\nwest, had not yet become a center of commerce. In 1879, the map showed\r\na post office, a toll gate, a store, a Methodist church, and a few\r\nresidences clustered at a crossroads.[69] This crossroads location\r\nbecame increasingly important during the last quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century; and, like other perceptive people of the area,\r\nFountain Beattie and his family began to swing the orientation of\r\ntheir activities around from an exclusive focus on Alexandria and\r\nWashington to take part in the growth of Fairfax County.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, Annandale had a population of 50 people.\r\nIn addition to the toll house, church, post office, and store, the\r\ncommunity now could list a hardware store, lumberyard, blacksmith,\r\nfarm machinery store, and sawmill.[70] The sawmill was owned by\r\nBeattie's son and namesake, Fountain Beattie, and presumably was\r\noperated as a family enterprise in the same manner as the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.

Citing census data, the\r\n        thesis notes that \"the value of farm implements and machinery\r\n        on farms in Virginia and West Virginia combined was only\r\n        two-thirds of what it was in Virginia in 1860, while the value\r\n        of livestock in the two states was only four-fifths of that in\r\n        Virginia in 1860. Not until 1880 did the number of cattle and\r\n        not until after the turn of the century did the number of\r\n        swine in Virginia and West Virginia equal the number in the\r\n        Old Dominion before the war.\"\r\n\r\n   [47] \"Status of Virginia Agriculture in 1870,\" in _Report of the\r\n        Commissioner of Agriculture_, 1870 (Washington, D.C.:\r\n        Government Printing Office, 1871), pp. 267-291, 273, 291.\r\n\r\n   [48] Virginia Good Roads Convention, _Programme_ (Richmond: Stone\r\n        Printing Co., 1894).

The same\r\n        traditions and habits descended from father to son through\r\n        successive generations. Now all this is altered. Strangers\r\n        from every State and every country are cordially welcomed\r\n        whenever they show any disposition to become permanent\r\n        settlers and industrious citizens. The consequence is that in\r\n        many counties a strong tide of immigration is setting in,\r\n        bearing with it improved stock and better implements, which\r\n        cannot fail to impart a healthy impulse to improvement.\"\r\n\r\n   [51] Moger, _Rebuilding_, p. 45.

Speaking to the Society in 1867, William\r\n        Fullerton of New York chided Virginians by asserting that\r\n        \"there is no other calling in life in which there is\r\n        manifested such an indifference to new discoveries, as is seen\r\n        among the tillers of the soil. If a mechanic or manufacturer\r\n        should in like manner fail to avail himself of improved\r\n        implements or machinery, he would be compelled to relinquish\r\n        his business. It is the farmer alone who resists anything new\r\n        appertaining to his calling. This arises mainly from a\r\n        deep-seated prejudice to what is called scientific or book\r\n        farming.\"\r\n\r\n        See also Moger, _Rebuilding_, p. 54, citing the fact that\r\n        farmers in the area of diversified agriculture, such as\r\n        Northern Virginia, had the highest number of agricultural\r\n        clubs, farm newspaper subscriptions, etc., of all areas in\r\n        Virginia.\r\n\r\n   [53] Main steps to assist agriculture taken by the state in the\r\n        1870's are summarized in Moger, _Rebuilding_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n   [54] Fairfax County Deed Book W-4, p. 271.\r\n\r\n   [55] J. S. Mosby, _Mosby's War Memoirs and Stuart's Cavalry\r\n        Campaigns_ (New York: Pageant Book Co., 1958), p. 10. Mosby\r\n        records in his memoirs that in Richmond, before being sent to\r\n        the Shenandoah Valley, the men were issued uniforms of very\r\n        rough quality from the state penitentiary. There was almost a\r\n        mutiny as the men piled them up in front of the captain's tent\r\n        and refused to wear them--all except Mosby and Beattie. Mosby\r\n        then states, \"I do not think any clothes I ever wore did me\r\n        more service than these. When I became a commander, I made\r\n        Beattie a lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n        This story is corroborated in Charles W. Russell (ed.), _The\r\n        Memoirs of Colonel John S. Mosby_ (Boston: Little Brown,\r\n        1917), p. 30.\r\n\r\n   [56] Beattie is mentioned frequently in histories of Mosby's\r\n        campaigns.

In\r\n        July 1864, a new company was organized, and Beattie was\r\n        elected first lieutenant.

THE END OF THE FARMING ERA: MICHAEL STRAIGHT (1942-1969)\r\n\r\nFountain Beattie sold Green Spring Farm in 1917. Annie Hathaway\r\nBeattie had died the year before, after they had moved from the farm\r\nto a house in Alexandria.[71] Beattie's deed to George R. Sims of\r\nFlorida is dated January 23, 1917, and conveyed the entire tract of\r\n339 acres.[72] Ownership changed again in 1922, 1924, and 1931,[73]\r\nand ultimately led to the subdivision of the tract into smaller\r\nparcels. In 1942, one of these parcels, containing the farmhouse and\r\nthe principal related buildings, was purchased by Michael and Belinda\r\nStraight.[74]\r\n\r\nThe Straights did not occupy the main farmhouse immediately but set\r\nabout having certain changes made in the interior design and\r\nstructure. These were completed late in 1942, and the family moved\r\nfrom the cottage to the main house.[75] A few months later, in January\r\n1943, their occupancy was interrupted as Michael Straight was called\r\nto service in the U.S. Army Air Force; and, during World War II, the\r\nhouse was occupied by tenants. The Straights returned to Northern\r\nVirginia in 1948 and took up residence at the farmhouse from that time\r\nuntil they moved to Georgetown in 1965.\r\n\r\nUpon their return to the farm in 1948, they also began to restore\r\nand redesign the grounds surrounding the farmhouse. During the\r\n1920's, when the farm was owned by Frederick Segesserman, a great many\r\nboxwoods had been planted. They had been raised for sale, and in\r\n1948 the pattern of their location on the grounds was erratic.\r\nTherefore, in 1948, a new landscape plan was worked out by Mrs. Max\r\nFarrand, a friend of the Straights and the designer of the gardens\r\nat Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown. Under her supervision, the\r\nboxwoods were transplanted into a great semicircle behind the\r\nhouse, the level of the lawn was raised, and retaining walls were\r\nplaced at several points. This area comprised the farm's only formal\r\ngarden; but, in addition, extensive plantings of white pine were\r\nplaced as a screen between the house and the road, and the grounds\r\nsurrounding the house were planted with a variety of trees and shrubs,\r\nincluding hemlocks, cherries, and crabapples, and later, lilacs,\r\nazaleas, and rhododendron.\r\n\r\nDuring the years the Straights lived at the farm, farming operations\r\nconsisted of the raising of Hereford cattle. Purchasing yearlings in\r\nthe markets of the lower Shenandoah Valley near Winchester, they kept\r\nthis stock at the farm for fattening and resale as two-year-old beef\r\ncattle.[76]\r\n\r\nA variety of other animals were kept on the farm, but these were\r\nmainly pets of the children.[77] In addition to their horses and\r\ndogs, certain of the Straights' animals acquired reputations of\r\nextraordinary extent. In particular were a goat which was presented to\r\nthe Straights by the author and journalist Eric Sevareid,[78] a\r\nmule acquired from the Alexandria SPCA, and a flock of Canada\r\ngeese which eventually became the subject of a special bulletin by\r\nthe Audubon Society to prevent local naturalists from erroneously\r\nreporting them as migrants.[79]\r\n\r\nDuring these years of residence at Green Spring Farm, Michael\r\nStraight served as editor and publisher of _The New Republic_\r\nmagazine, wrote three books, and served on the governing boards of\r\nseveral organizations active in international affairs.[80] These\r\nactivities brought to the farm many visitors whose accomplishments in\r\npolitics, literature, science, and the arts were nationally and\r\ninternationally recognized. Some of the distinguished visitors to\r\nGreen Spring Farm during these years included scientists Julian\r\nHuxley and Leo Szilard, authors Aldous Huxley and Saul Bellow, poet\r\nDylan Thomas, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, and political\r\nleader Hubert Humphrey. The farm also was a visiting place for\r\ndistinguished journalists from all parts of the United States and\r\nmany foreign countries, including Soviet Russia, when they came to\r\nWashington. An account of one of these visits, written by one of the\r\nforeign journalists, is set forth in appendix G.[81]\r\n\r\nThe farm became well known in the community of which it was a part as\r\nit was the scene of numerous festive community gatherings when the\r\nneighbors from the immediate area joined the Straights and their\r\nguests to celebrate such special events and holidays as the Fourth of\r\nJuly and to enjoy dinner, games, and discussions under the trees.\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the Straights, active farming operations ceased.\r\nDuring their occupancy, fundamental changes in the character of\r\nNorthern Virginia's development brought the era of farming to an end\r\nand ushered in an era in which this region became part of the social\r\nand economic system centered in Washington. Intensive subdivision and\r\nestablishment of commercial service facilities became the highest and\r\nbest uses of the land as population growth in the National Capital\r\narea rose at a rate which led other parts of the United States.\r\nOutsiders moving into Northern Virginia and Washington residents\r\nseeking to move from the central city into the outskirts filled up the\r\nopen spaces of Fairfax County at a rate of over 1,000 new residents\r\nper month.[82]\r\n\r\nAlong with the temptation of high land prices, rising taxes added to\r\nthe pressure on the farmer to \"sell out\" to the land developer. It was\r\nsaid, with much truth, that one could not afford to be a farmer in\r\nFairfax County as the 1950's ended and the 1960's began. For the 33\r\nacres and buildings on Green Spring Farm, as for many other\r\nresidences, taxes rose sharply. In 1943, the farm was evaluated at\r\n$7,819, and the tax bill was $194.69; by 1960, the evaluation was\r\n$36,050, and the taxes $1,351.88.[83]\r\n\r\nSo, gradually, Green Spring Farm became an island of open space in a\r\nsea of houses and highways. The Little River Turnpike (Route 236) was\r\nwidened and modernized in 1959. In 1948, this road had been an\r\n18-foot-wide, two lane black-top roadway. Twenty years later, it had\r\nbeen transformed into a 106-foot-wide, four-lane dual highway, much of\r\nwhich was lined with concrete curbs and gutters to accommodate\r\nroadside commercial or residential development. The old turnpike had\r\nbeen redesigned and, in the late 1960's, carried over 26,000 vehicles\r\nper day.[84] Its function as a major interregional artery of\r\ntransportation had been taken over by others, leaving to it a new role\r\nas a major connector in the network of roads and streets serving\r\nprimarily local traffic. In contrast to earlier times when proximity\r\nto the road was to be desired, the attractiveness of the farmhouse in\r\nthe 1960's was enhanced by its surrounding space which furnished a\r\nshield from the highway and a setting for its activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

During\r\n        the remodeling, the Straights lived in the spring house, which\r\n        they called \"The Cottage.\"\r\n\r\n   [76] _Ibid._ Aberdeens were also brought to the farm, but did not\r\n        thrive as well as Herefords. The Straights' herd ranged from\r\n        15 to 25 at any one time. Bought at weights of about 500\r\n        pounds, these cattle were held until they weighed 1,100 to\r\n        1,200 pounds and then were sold for beef.\r\n\r\n   [77] _Ibid._ The fondness of the Straight children for animals drew\r\n        pets from field and pond, including rabbits, birds, snakes,\r\n        spiders, and the like. These were housed mainly in the\r\n        enclosed side porch.\r\n\r\n   [78] _Ibid._ The gift goat was the subject of one of Mr. Sevareid's\r\n        columns entitled \"It is More Blessed to Give Than to Receive.\"\r\n        During his stay at Green Spring Farm, the goat established a\r\n        reputation for eating various valuable articles (such as a\r\n        canvas automobile top) and ringing a number of the fruit\r\n        trees.\r\n\r\n   [79] _Ibid._ The flock of Canada geese started from a pair that was\r\n        attracted to one of the farm ponds, which in earlier times had\r\n        been used to furnish ice for the farm. As the flock of geese\r\n        grew, it ceased to migrate, and frequented the Straights' pond\r\n        and nearby Lake Barcroft.\r\n\r\n   [80] _Who's Who in America, 1966-1967_, contains the following\r\n        information on Mr. Straight: In 1943, he wrote _Make This the\r\n        Last War_; in 1954, _Trial by Television_; in 1960,\r\n        _Carrington_; and in 1963, _A Very Small Remnant_. In 1943, he\r\n        also served as Vice President of the Fight for Freedom; and in\r\n        1946-1947 as Secretary of the Emergency Committee of Atomic\r\n        Scientists.\r\n\r\n   [81] Michael and Belinda Straight, interview December 8, 1968.

From one of these contacts the suggestion was made\r\n        that a group of Soviet Russian journalists touring the United\r\n        States might be interested in visiting Green Spring Farm.\r\n\r\n   [82] Fairfax County Division of Planning, August 1969.\r\n\r\n   [83] Fairfax County Tax Books, 1943, 1960.

August 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURAL HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION: THE MANSION HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SETTING. Green Spring Farm is located in Mason Magisterial\r\nDistrict, approximately one-eighth mile north of Little River Turnpike\r\nand one-eighth mile east of Braddock Road. Via the Little River\r\nTurnpike, the farm is approximately six miles west of Alexandria and\r\napproximately two miles east of Annandale.\r\n\r\nThe terrain in the vicinity of the farm is mainly flat, with some very\r\ngentle rolling areas. It is well watered, being crossed by Turkey Cock\r\nRun. During 1946-50, three ponds were dug in back of the house. They\r\nare spring-fed, and their runoff drains into Turkey Cock Run. With the\r\noriginal forest cover cleared off at least 200 years ago, the present\r\nclusters of pine and oak, and the incidence of hemlock, cherry,\r\ncrabapple, and other flowering species, represent a reforestation\r\nseveral generations removed from the original, and, in other\r\ninstances, the landscaping done by the Straights in the late 1940's.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE SITE. The mansion house faces south and is connected with the\r\nLittle River Turnpike by a black-top (asphalt-surfaced) road which\r\npasses on the west side of the house and runs north to Braddock Road.\r\nInside the post and rail fence, alongside this road, the driveway up\r\nto the house is lined with trees, and the yard in front of the house\r\nis open and flat. Between the lawn and the road, a line of cedars in\r\nthe fence row serves as a screen.\r\n\r\nThe back (north side) of the house faces a semicircular open grass\r\nlawn, bordered with hedges which provide both a screen for the lawn\r\nand a background for several stone carvings and cement castings which\r\ndecorate a lawn approximately 1,500 square feet in size. At the\r\nnortheast corner of this open space is located the log cabin; beyond\r\nthe log cabin, approximately 110 feet in a northeasterly direction, is\r\nthe barn, which is converted into living quarters.[85]\r\n\r\nNorthwest of the main house, facing on Green Spring Road, is the\r\nspring house. Originally built over a series of natural springs in\r\norder to have water for cooling dairy products, this stone house was\r\nconverted into a small dwelling house by the Straights in 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND HISTORY. In its present condition,\r\nthe mansion house at Green Spring Farm cannot be considered to\r\nrepresent any particular period of American architecture. The original\r\ncore of the building illustrates a design which was typical of the\r\ncolonial era in Tidewater Virginia. This portion of the house is of\r\nbrick construction, two stories plus attic and cellar, with the rooms\r\nin each end of the house separated by a center hallway. Large chimneys\r\nat each end of the house made possible heating by fireplaces in each\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that this structure formed the core of the mansion\r\nhouse when it was occupied by the Moss family (1770's to 1835). To\r\nthis core, various outbuildings and dependencies were added; a\r\nseparate cookhouse or kitchen annex to the main house was one of these\r\nrelated structures, as were the family's sanitary facilities. Clothes\r\nwashing, churning, candlemaking, and various other household tasks\r\nwere also performed in separate buildings. No direct evidence of the\r\nappearance of the main house or the various related outbuildings has\r\nbeen discovered; some inferences about these matters may be drawn from\r\nthe inventory of personal property sold from the farm at auction in\r\n1835 and a drawing of the house on an 1840 survey (figure 2).\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the south side of the house show the building as it\r\nappeared in 1885 (figure 5). At this time, a one-story porch had been\r\nbuilt across the entire length of the front. The entry into the house\r\nacross this porch was open, but on each side of the front door the\r\nporch was enclosed, making small rooms approximately 9 by 12 feet in\r\nsize. From each room a door opened out onto the porch. The porch was\r\nroofed with sheet metal, and carved wooden brackets were in the\r\ncorners of the center section (figure 5). A sidewalk led from the\r\nentrance in the center of the ivy-covered front porch straight across\r\nthe spacious, shaded lawn.\r\n\r\nPhotographs in 1936 show the front porch removed but with clear signs\r\nof its recent presence showing in the whitewash on the front wall of\r\nthe house (figure 7). At this time, the roof of the main house was\r\nsheet metal in place of the earlier use of shingles. However, shingles\r\nstill constituted the roofing of the dependency on the east end of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe 1885 photographs show a one-story brick addition on the east end\r\nof the house. This was a kitchen, built sometime after the main\r\nportion of the house but still probably in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century. The notice of sale of the farm following Thomas\r\nMoss's death in 1835 speaks of \"a Brick Dwelling, containing eight\r\nrooms, Brick Kitchen, Meat House, Servants' House, ...\" and other farm\r\nand outbuildings.[86] Of all the buildings mentioned in this notice,\r\nthe kitchen appears to be the most logical and appropriate use for\r\nthis addition. Later occupants of the house (1880-1917) used this wing\r\nfor a kitchen and describe it as not only the center for preparation\r\nof food but for numerous other household activities, such as\r\ncandlemaking.[87]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of rooms during the nineteenth century is not known\r\nwith certainty. The 1839 reference to eight rooms suggests that as\r\noriginally built the house had four rooms on each floor, with perhaps\r\nno effort to use the attic as living space, at least until the time of\r\nFountain Beattie who added dormers to the attic and used this top\r\nfloor to help accommodate his large family. This inference is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that prior to the 1940's the central core of\r\nthe house was laid out in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10. GREEN SPRING FARM MANSION HOUSE, Floor Plans,\r\n1969]\r\n\r\nThe major renovation of the house in the early 1940's was planned and\r\ncarried out by Walter Macomber and resulted in the addition of a wing\r\non the west end of the central block (in which a new kitchen was\r\ninstalled), conversion of the old kitchen wing on the east end of the\r\ncentral core into a living room with a small sunporch attached,\r\nrearrangement of the stairways and central hallway, and certain other\r\ninterior changes. This involved removal of substantial amounts of the\r\noriginal materials in the house and replacement by material considered\r\nto be suitable in terms of age and texture. These changes are\r\nreflected in the exterior appearance and interior room arrangement of\r\nthe house at the present time.\r\n\r\nFurther structural changes were made in 1960. At this time it was\r\ndiscovered that the second floor was sagging because of the removal of\r\nbearing walls in 1942 when the first floor was converted from four\r\nrooms into two.[88] This situation was corrected by pouring concrete\r\nfootings in the basement and setting in them a series of steel\r\ncolumns. These columns ran up through the wall on the west side of the\r\ncentral hallway and were topped by a steel beam running the width of\r\nthe house. The joists for the second floor were anchored in this new\r\nbeam.[89]\r\n\r\nAt the same time this structural reinforcement was being added,\r\nseveral closets, cabinets, and bookcases were built into the rooms on\r\nthe second floor and attic, making use of space under the eaves.\r\n\r\nThe remodeling done in 1960 was designed and supervised by Keyes,\r\nLethbridge & Condon, Washington architects.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the exterior fabric appears to be sound and well\r\nmaintained. On the interior, a certain amount of deterioration is\r\nevidenced in the looseness of the joints in the flooring and stairs\r\nand in the uneven settling of door frames in the original portion of\r\nthe house. The grounds adjacent to the house are in good condition and\r\nappear to be well maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION--EXTERIOR.\r\n\r\n_Overall Dimensions._ Width: 78 feet by 25 feet in central section,\r\nand 20 feet in wings. Height: central section, two and one-half\r\nstories; wings, one and one-half stories; sunporch, one story.\r\n\r\n_Foundations._ The central section of the house stands on brick\r\nfoundations which are carried up through the basement walls.\r\n\r\nA brick wall extending upward to the second floor divides the basement\r\ninto two sections and served as part of the original foundations. In\r\nthe basement, a series of arches in this wall permitted passage\r\nbetween the two sections. In 1960, the upper portions of this wall\r\nwere found to have deteriorated to the point that it was necessary to\r\npour concrete footings in the basement and erect a series of steel\r\ncolumns up through the wall to relieve it from bearing the weight of\r\nthe second-floor beams and floor joists.\r\n\r\nThe east wing (present living room, former kitchen) rests on brick\r\nfoundations, with the present wooden flooring laid over the original\r\ncobblestone floor of the old kitchen. The west wing (present kitchen)\r\nrests on concrete footings and slab at grade.\r\n\r\n_Wall Construction._ Walls are constructed of medium red brick (3\r\nby 9 by 12 inches), using the following bonds: central block\r\nfront--Flemish bond; central block rear--English bond; central block\r\nend walls--English bond; east wing--American or common bond, with\r\nseven courses of stretchers to each course of headers; west\r\nwing--American or common bond, with six courses of stretchers to\r\neach course of headers.\r\n\r\n_Chimneys._ Interior brick chimneys are located in the center of the\r\neast and west ends of the central block. These chimneys have separate\r\nflues for four fireplaces (two each on the first and second floors)\r\nand measure 5 feet by 2 feet 8 inches. Three courses of brick are\r\ncorbelled to make the capping of the chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe end walls of the east and west wings of the house also each have\r\nan interior chimney centered in the wall. The chimney in the east\r\nwing, measuring 3 feet by 1 foot 8 inches and having three courses of\r\nbrick corbelled for a capping, was used for the fireplace in the old\r\nkitchen which occupied that part of the house prior to 1942.\r\n\r\n_Doors and Doorways._ The front doorway is inset (1 foot 8 inches) in\r\nan entrance faced with white painted wooden panels. The entrance is\r\nframed by a plain triangular pediment and pilasters without\r\ndecorations on either shafts or capitals. The front door is a\r\nsix-panel door, designed to harmonize with the interior doors which\r\nare originals. Over the door is a four-light rectangular transom.\r\n\r\nThe rear entrance is a 6 by 8-foot portico, built up three steps from\r\nground level. Along the sides of the portico are 3-foot railings,\r\ninside of which are wooden boxes which serve both as storage boxes and\r\nas seats. The portico roof is supported by wooden Doric columns set at\r\nits outer edges, and the front end of the roof is a plain triangular\r\npediment. The rear doorway has a transom and door similar to the front\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opens onto a 4 by 4-foot wooden porch with railing\r\nand three steps to ground level.\r\n\r\nThe sunporch door has interchangeable screen and glass panels for\r\nwinter and summer use and opens on the front of the house at ground\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n_Windows and Shutters._ In the central block, the front doorway is\r\nflanked by French windows, with 12-over-9 lights in double-hung wooden\r\nsash. The rear windows on the first floor are 9-over-9 lights in\r\ndouble-hung wooden sash. Windows on the second floor front and rear\r\nsides are 6-over-6 lights in double-hung wooden sash, as are the\r\ndormer windows and gable end windows. The windows on the first and\r\nsecond floors of the central block have 2-foot 10-inch wooden sills\r\nand full-length louvered shutters hung on pintles (two on each side of\r\nthe window frame). Window frames, sills, and muntins are painted dark\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nIn the east and west wings of the house, the front windows are\r\n6-over-6 lights in double-hung wooden sash. The rear window in the\r\neast wing (living room) has a dead-light picture window (6 by 4 feet)\r\nflanked by windows with 6-over-9 lights in double-hung wooden sash.\r\nWindow frames, sills, and muntins are white, and full-length wooden\r\nshutters are dark green.\r\n\r\nIn the brickwork of the house, flat arches have been laid over all of\r\nthe windows on the first floor, except over the windows on the rear of\r\nthe central block.\r\n\r\nThe sunporch on the east end of the house is of frame construction and\r\nhas nine windows (2-1/2 by 5 feet) on three sides.\r\n\r\n_Roof._ Photographs taken about 1900 show the house with an enclosed\r\nporch across the front and a sheet metal roof on the porch. In\r\ncontrast, the central block of the house and the kitchen (east) wing\r\nhave shingled roofs (figure 5). Photographs in 1936 show the central\r\nportion of the house with a sheet metal roof (figure 7). In 1942, the\r\nroofing on all parts of the house was replaced with specially made\r\nconcrete shingles, which are still in place.[90]\r\n\r\nThe roof is a simple medium-pitched roof with plain gable ends.\r\nInterior chimneys are centered in each end of the center section and\r\nin the east end of the living room (former kitchen) wing.\r\n\r\nFull-length copper gutters are incorporated into the eaves and project\r\napproximately six inches above and beyond the cornice.\r\n\r\nCornices on the front and rear of the center section of the house are\r\ncomposed of dentils, running approximately three segments per foot.\r\nIdentical plain wooden cornices are used on the front and rear of the\r\ntwo wings of the house.\r\n\r\nEach wing has one dormer centered in the front and two on the rear\r\nsides of the roof. The center section of the house has three dormers\r\non the front side of the roof. All dormers have a single window,\r\nconsisting of 6-over-6 lights, set vertically in the front face. All\r\ndormers have beaded ship-lap siding laid parallel to the pitched roof.\r\nThis latter feature appears to be a change made in 1942 since\r\nphotographs of the house in 1885 and 1936 show the siding on the\r\ndormers laid parallel to the ground.\r\n\r\n_Enclosures._ A post and rail fence stands at the edge of the front\r\nlawn and, together with a line of hemlocks growing immediately inside\r\nthe fence, forms a screen between the house and the entrance road\r\nleading in from the Little River Turnpike. In the rear, a semicircular\r\nscreen of boxwood frames the lawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION--INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n_Central Block._ The central block of the house, comprising the\r\nportion which was built first (possibly as early as 1760), is laid out\r\non the traditional pattern used by many colonial Virginia homes--a\r\ncentral hallway with one or two rooms on each side, with chimneys at\r\neach end serving fireplaces in each room. In the case of Green Spring\r\nFarm, a narrow (4-foot 6-inch-wide) central hallway runs straight\r\nthrough from the front door to an opposing rear door. Floor boards are\r\nof random width (5 to 6 inches), and walls are paneled 3 feet 6 inches\r\nup from the floor, with wallpaper above. Doorways open off the central\r\nhallway into a library (east side) and a dining room (west side).\r\n\r\nPrior to 1942, the rear portion of the center hallway contained\r\nstairways to the second floor and to the basement, while still\r\nallowing access to the rear door. In 1942, however, the stairway to\r\nthe basement was shifted to the west (new kitchen) wing, which was\r\nbuilt at that time; and the stairway to the second floor was shifted\r\ninto the library.[91]\r\n\r\nIn the library, at the rear of the room a narrow (2-foot 6-inch-wide)\r\nstairway rises from the corner nearest the hallway to the second floor\r\nhallway above (figure 13). This stairway extends over the hall doorway\r\nand, together with a panel-and-spindle partition, forms a covered\r\nentryway into the room. A small closet utilizes the space underneath\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nThe present library is a designed room, created in 1942 by Walter\r\nMacomber. The design utilizes the full width of the house and thus\r\nreplaces two rooms (approximately 12 by 12 feet) which originally had\r\ncomprised the first area east of the central hallway. This original\r\nroom design had had a fireplace in each of these two rooms, and in\r\n1942 both were replaced. The one serving the rear room was taken out\r\nentirely as the doorway into the living room wing was cut through at\r\nthat point. The one in the former front room was replaced by another\r\nfireplace, specially designed by Mr. Macomber, and built of materials\r\nfrom a late eighteenth century tavern near Peace Cross, Maryland.[92]\r\n\r\nBuilt into the east wall of the library on each side of the fireplace\r\nare identical cabinets, the lower parts of which are enclosed and the\r\nupper parts are open shelves. The overmantel area is wallpapered, as\r\nare the portions of the room's wall occupied by the window facing the\r\nfront yard and the wall between the library and central hallway. Open\r\nshelving for books occupies part of this latter wall, to a height of\r\neight feet.\r\n\r\nThe entire room has a cornice molding of stained wood, matching the\r\npaneling used for the stairs, the fireplace, and the built-in\r\ncabinets flanking the fireplace. Across the central hallway, the\r\npresent dining room was designed and created in 1942. As in the\r\ncase of the library, brick interior walls separating two smaller rooms\r\n(approximately 12 by 12 feet) were removed to allow the dining room to\r\nutilize the full width (25 feet) of the house. The fireplace\r\nserving the rear of the original rooms was replaced by a doorway\r\ninto the new kitchen wing through a butler's pantry. The fireplace\r\nserving the front of the original rooms was retained in the present\r\ndining room. Beside this fireplace and extending to the front wall is\r\na butterfly cupboard specially designed for that location. Chair\r\nrail, baseboard, and door trim in the room are thought to be original;\r\nbut the ceiling cornice was added in 1942 and consists of double-ogee\r\ndesign over beaded plasterboard which is typical of the period of\r\nthe house.[93] A cupboard by the doorway to the butler's pantry is\r\nof modern design and was installed as an added convenience in the\r\ndining room.\r\n\r\nThe doors to the central hallway and to the butler's pantry are\r\nthought to have been originally on the second floor of the house.[94]\r\nThe hallway door has six panels, with beaded edges and quarter-round\r\nmolding in the panels. A fillet molding (4-1/2 inches) surrounds the\r\ndoorway frame. The door has been drastically trimmed to fit the frame.\r\nThe door to the butler's pantry has four panels but with a flat raised\r\npanel and no quarter-round molding at the panel edges--a style typical\r\nof the later nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe second floor of the central block of the house originally was laid\r\nout identically with the first floor--that is, two rooms on each side\r\nof a central hallway. In the 1942 renovation, this same room\r\narrangement was retained for the west side of the central hall (above\r\nthe dining room), while on the east side of the hall a single bedroom\r\n(12 by 25 feet) was created using the full depth of the house. In this\r\nbedroom, cabinets with louvered double doors were installed on each\r\nside of the fireplace and painted white to match the fireplace mantel.\r\nThis fireplace is one of the features retained from the original house\r\nand has a mantel which is plain except for a denticulated molding.\r\nChair rail, also thought to be original, is installed on all exposed\r\nareas of wall in the room.\r\n\r\nAcross the central hallway, the two bedrooms retain the same basic\r\ndesign of the original house. Both are approximately 11 by 11 feet and\r\nhave random-width flooring and chair rail on two sides of the room.\r\nThe original fireplaces have been retained in these rooms. In the\r\nfront room, the fireplace mantel is entirely plain; in the rear room,\r\nthe mantel has two supporting columns and has three diamond shapes\r\ncarved in the wood. Both rooms have built-in cabinets, shelves, and\r\nclosets, some of which were installed in 1942 and some which were\r\nadded in 1960. Also added in 1942 is the door connecting the front\r\nbedroom with the staircase from the first floor of the west wing.\r\nThrough the passageway at the head of these stairs, there is access to\r\nthe second floor of the west wing.\r\n\r\nThe third floor (or attic) is entered by a stairway in the central\r\nstaircase. At the head of this stairway is a hallway connecting\r\nbedrooms in the east and west ends of the house and providing access\r\nto closets at the rear of the house and a small bathroom (7 by 7 feet)\r\nat the front of the house. The bathroom has a dormer window to the\r\nfront of the house, and each of the bedrooms has a dormer window to\r\nthe front and a window in the gable end wall. The gable end windows\r\nare set in plaster arches, flanked in each case by a 4-foot-high\r\ncandle shelf. Both bedrooms have built-in closets, cupboards, and\r\nshelves. Bedroom walls have plain plaster finish and plain wooden\r\nbaseboards, no cornices, and no chair rail.\r\n\r\n_East Wing._ The east wing of the house presently includes the living\r\nroom and a sunporch. The floor level of this wing is 1 foot 8 inches\r\nlower than the floor level of the central block; and the connecting\r\ndoorway has three steps, with double doors at the top step.\r\n\r\nThe date when the east wing was built is not certain, but it is\r\nprobable that the basic structure comprising the wing was constructed\r\naround 1840 and thereafter used as a kitchen or combination\r\nkitchen-dining room until the renovation of the house in 1942.\r\nPhotographs taken about 1900 and in 1936 show this wing with a door\r\nopening to the front of the house at ground level. The floor of the\r\nold kitchen was laid with cobblestones, and the east end of the room\r\nhad a great hearth and Dutch oven. Food was cooked here and taken up\r\nthe stairs into the main part of the house. Many other household\r\nchores (such as soapmaking) were performed here.[95]\r\n\r\nWhen the house was renovated in 1942, the cobblestone floor of the\r\nroom was overlaid with wooden flooring and pine wainscotting was added\r\nto the walls. On the north side, looking out onto the semicircular\r\nlawn, a picture window was installed. On the south side of the room,\r\nthe outside door was replaced with a window similar to the one already\r\nin that side (figure 9). The large hearth and fireplace were replaced\r\nwith a smaller one similar to what had been installed in the library\r\n(with the unusual wooden lintel).\r\n\r\nAccording to the renovator, the paneling for the doorway connecting\r\nthe living room and library came from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The\r\novermantel and paneling around the living room fireplace and over the\r\ndoorway connecting the living room and sunporch came from a tavern\r\nnear Peace Cross, Maryland, where it had been used as shuttering.[96]\r\nThe architraves around the fireplace and pilasters were designed by\r\nthe renovator from materials obtained in Pennsylvania.[97] The cornice\r\nin the living room is of cypress wood.\r\n\r\nEntrance to the sunporch from the living room is through a doorway\r\ntrimmed in material from an old building in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWrought iron H hinges are used on the built-in cabinets in the east\r\nwall (next to the fireplace). The sunporch door has wrought iron\r\nhinges and a brass box lock.\r\n\r\nThe sunporch, added to the east wing in 1942, is frame construction on\r\na concrete slab floor. When built, it was a screened porch, but later\r\nwas converted to glass window panels to accommodate plants and pet\r\nanimals in all seasons.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor of the east wing is a bedroom and bathroom suite,\r\nentered from the central block of the house on the second floor level.\r\nDormer windows are on the north (rear) and south (front) sides of the\r\nbedroom, and the bathroom has a dormer window on the north side. The\r\nbedroom has built-in closets, shelves, and cupboards, the hardware of\r\nwhich is wrought iron. Doors have box locks and small brass door\r\nknobs. Two steps are built into the doorway connecting the east wing\r\nwith the central block of the house on the second floor level.\r\n\r\n_West Wing._ The west wing of the house was added in 1942, and was\r\ndesigned by the renovator, Walter Macomber.\r\n\r\nThe first floor contains a modern kitchen, a butler's pantry, and a\r\nstaircase containing stairways to the basement and to the second\r\nfloor, together with storage closets. An exterior door in the end wall\r\nprovides direct access to the outside.\r\n\r\nThe second floor of the west wing contains a bedroom and bathroom\r\nsuite similar in layout to the suite on the second floor of the east\r\nwing. The bedroom contains built-in closets, shelves, and cupboards,\r\nand wrought iron hardware (thumb latches and H and L hinges).\r\n\r\n_Basement._ The basement is beneath the central block of the house,\r\nand its design is basically unchanged from the original except for the\r\nconcrete footings and steel columns placed there in 1960 to strengthen\r\nthe deteriorating brick interior wall. The basement was not extended\r\nunderneath either of the two wings of the house when they were\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nEntrance to the basement originally was by a stairway located at the\r\nend of the central hallway, where also was located the stairway to the\r\nsecond floor and attic. In 1942, however, the stairway to the basement\r\nwas shifted to a new staircase located in the new west wing of the\r\nhouse, where it is at the present time. The basement currently\r\ncontains gas heating equipment for the house, a water heater, and\r\nstorage space.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURAL HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION: THE MANSION HOUSE\r\n\r\n   [85] Mrs. Michael Straight, interview December 1969. Certain pieces\r\n        of the garden sculpture are from Peking, China. Others include\r\n        \"Frog Girl\" by Willi Soukop.\r\n\r\n   [86] _Alexandria Gazette_, November 6, 1839.\r\n\r\n   [87] John Mosby Beattie, interview April 17, 1969.\r\n\r\n   [88] David Condon, AIA; interview December 11, 1969. The earlier room\r\n        layout of the central block of the house had two rooms, each\r\n        about 12 by 12 feet, on each side of the central hallway which\r\n        ran through the house widthwise. Each of these four rooms had\r\n        its own fireplace located in the end wall. This pattern was\r\n        duplicated in the four rooms on the second floor.\r\n\r\n        A somewhat unusual feature of this building was that the\r\n        joists for the first and second floors ran lengthwise rather\r\n        than across the house. They were anchored in the brick outer\r\n        wall and in a brick bearing wall running the width of the\r\n        house in the basement and extending up to the second floor. In\r\n        1960, it was found that this wall was crumbling and in danger\r\n        of allowing the second-floor joists to pull out of their\r\n        sockets. The installation of a series of steel columns holding\r\n        up a steel beam had the effect of taking all bearing weight\r\n        off this original segment of brick wall.\r\n\r\n   [89] _Ibid._ The location of this masonry wall in the basement and\r\n        its extension upward to the second floor made it possible for\r\n        the original house to have the floor joists set lengthwise\r\n        with the house instead of front-to-back. The joists were thus\r\n        anchored in the outside walls at each end of the house and in\r\n        the center wall running midway through the house.\r\n\r\n   [90] Walter Macomber, interview held July 16, 1968, at Green Spring\r\n        Farm. Mr. Macomber's description of these shingles is as\r\n        follows: \"This shingle is something I helped develop for\r\n        Williamsburg. We never did use it extensively, but it was made\r\n        ... in Richmond [by] a man named Hendricks.... It's made of\r\n        concrete reinforced with two or three wires to the length of\r\n        it.\"\r\n\r\n   [91] _Ibid._ This stairway was also reversed when it was moved into\r\n        the library. As it originally stood in the hallway, the\r\n        stairway ran upward from front to rear of the house, and a\r\n        stairway to the basement was constructed underneath so as to\r\n        run down to the basement from the rear to the front of the\r\n        house.\r\n\r\n        A second stairway between the first and second floors was also\r\n        installed in a new staircase constructed in the new kitchen\r\n        (west) wing built in 1942.\r\n\r\n   [92] _Ibid._ Transcript of Mr. Macomber's description of the library\r\n        is as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: Now this room--the library--is a designed\r\n          room.\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Netherton_: By you, do you mean?\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: Yes.\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Netherton_: Do you know what the room was before?\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: Well, it was really plain.\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Netherton_: Is this an Adam mantelpiece?\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: You could call this an Adam mantel,\r\n          although it's not truly. It's a mantel of about 1790....\r\n          This wood came from an old tavern near Peace Cross in\r\n          Maryland. The building was torn down to make way for a\r\n          large shopping center. This is all designed. This is a\r\n          design of my own with the little dovetails which are a\r\n          little affectation of mine. [Pointing to the entryway\r\n          between the library and central hall.] At least part of\r\n          this stair was original. The newel post and the balusters\r\n          and the paneling under the first run of the stair are\r\n          original, and the sheathing from that point up into the\r\n          hall is a design, and was made right on the job by our\r\n          carpenters.\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Netherton_: Did you lengthen these windows to the\r\n          floor?\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: They were this way when we got the house,\r\n          but they had been changed some time prior to 1942.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Netherton_: The cupboard was part of the design, was\r\n          it not?\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: Yes, it was, and I think this is one of\r\n          the panels that came from Pennsylvania.... [Also] the\r\n          paneled jamb from the library down into the living room\r\n          came from this old building in Lancaster County\r\n          [Pennsylvania]. And also the trim around the opening.\r\n\r\n        The renovator's description of the dining room included the\r\n        following comments:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. Macomber_: The mantel is a mantel of the period, and\r\n          I'm quite sure it was in this room. The butterfly cupboard\r\n          beside it is a design that was added to the room, and\r\n          designed and built and installed for this particular\r\n          location. The dining room, being a small room, we planned\r\n          the recess beside the fireplace for the sideboard and also\r\n          to give a little more space in the room and in the pantry.\r\n          The chair rail I'm sure is original and the door trim, but\r\n          the cornice I installed. The base is original, in most\r\n          cases, I believe the doors are original, although the\r\n          bottom rail has been cut off on this to such a degree, it\r\n          looks as though it might have been for another opening.\r\n          And that's true on the door into the library.\r\n\r\n   [93] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n   [94] _Ibid._ Mr. Macomber's recollection is that \"I'm quite sure it\r\n        came from the second floor because it's the same as the door\r\n        into the nursery room....\" As to the door into the hallway, he\r\n        notes that it originally had been painted dark blue-green.\r\n\r\n   [95] Michael and Belinda Straight, interview of December 8, 1968.\r\n        John Mosby Beattie recalls when animal fat was cooked in the\r\n        fireplace of the old kitchen to make soap.\r\n\r\n   [96] Walter Macomber, interview July 16, 1969.\r\n\r\n   [97] _Ibid._ According to local tradition, the tavern near Peace\r\n        Cross originally was a residence, then a tavern, a gambling\r\n        house, and a bawdy house. While a gambling house, it was\r\n        robbed, and shots were fired after the fleeing burglar. One of\r\n        the shots went into the shutters, and the hole made by this\r\n        shot is still visible in the portion of the shutter used as\r\n        paneling in the living room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobey House Approach, Green Spring Farm]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobey House, Patio and Fountain]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobey House, Interior. Figure 14. Photos by Robert\r\nLautman, c. 1960]\r\n\r\nASSOCIATED BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE TOBEY HOUSE\r\n\r\nHISTORY. The Tobey House is located approximately one-quarter mile\r\neast-southeast of the main house on Green Spring Farm. It was built in\r\n1954 as a residence for Mrs. Charles W. Tobey, the mother of Mrs.\r\nMichael Straight and widow of the late distinguished United States\r\nSenator from New Hampshire. Prior to that time, Mrs. Tobey had resided\r\npart of the time in Washington and part of the time in Concord, New\r\nHampshire, where she owned a spacious, gabled New England mansion\r\nbuilt about 1750. In order for her to be nearer her daughter and\r\ngrandchildren, arrangements were made by Michael Straight to have a\r\nsmall, modern, open-design house built for Mrs. Tobey on Green Spring\r\nFarm.[98]\r\n\r\nArchitectural plans were completed in the fall of 1953, and\r\nconstruction was completed in 1954. Here Mrs. Tobey lived with her\r\nhousekeeper, Miss Frances McFall, from 1954 to 1968.[99]\r\n\r\nThe house originally was comprised of a living-dining room, kitchen,\r\ntwo bedrooms, bath, and utility (heater) room. In 1957, however, it\r\nwas expanded by the addition of another living room, bathroom, and\r\nutility room. At this time, also, the carport was relocated, and\r\nterraces were created on the east and west sides of the house. The\r\nresult was to enlarge the living space within the house and to create\r\nan arrangement whereby a living room, bath, and utility room could be\r\npartitioned off (by a folding door) to make a guest suite. The\r\naddition of the semienclosed areas adjacent to the house, with their\r\nflagstone terraces and fountain pool, made for the enjoyment of\r\noutdoor activities.\r\n\r\nInside the house, the design and decor encouraged the feeling of\r\ncloseness to the outdoors by the location of window space and the use\r\nof floor-to-ceiling glass walls at points where the landscaped\r\nsurroundings of the house could be seen from the inside; and paneled\r\nwalls provided a neutral yet sympathetic background for many fine\r\npieces of antique furniture and other artifacts which Mrs. Tobey\r\nbrought from New Hampshire. Also, use of horizontal ship-lap siding\r\nfor the exterior gives a suggestion of New England clapboards.\r\n\r\nFollowing her residence in the house from 1954 to 1968, Mrs. Tobey\r\nmoved to Washington, D.C., and the house was occupied by tenants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15. Tobey House Floor Plans, 1957]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Section, 1954]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SETTING AND SITE OF THE HOUSE. Located in the southeast corner\r\nof Green Spring Farm, the Tobey House enjoys a setting of generally\r\nopen, slightly rolling countryside.[100] This setting is preserved on\r\nthe land which comprises the farm. Beyond these limits, however, the\r\nneighborhood of the farm has experienced a rapid and drastic\r\ntransition in the 1950's and 1960's. As a result, its predominantly\r\nrural character has been largely replaced by tracts of subdivisions\r\ncomposed of single-family dwellings on lots ranging from one-fifth to\r\none-half acre of land. At the same time, the Little River Turnpike\r\n(Route 236) has attracted extensive roadside commercial development,\r\nresulting in increased highway traffic generated by the intensified\r\ndensity of land use. This has accentuated the importance of the farm's\r\nbuffer space in preserving the tranquility and natural beauty which\r\nthe owner and architect sought for the Tobey House.\r\n\r\nThe site of the house is set back from the Little River Turnpike\r\napproximately one-eighth mile and is connected with the pike by its\r\nown driveway. The driveway approaches the house from the southwest\r\nwhere the view first is of the carport and the 1957 addition. The\r\nimmediate vicinity of the house has been left relatively open to\r\nprovide a feeling of spaciousness when viewed from inside the house.\r\nLandscaped trees and shrubs located around the house preserve this\r\nfeeling of an open natural setting while providing cover for the house\r\nand terraces.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. Since it was Mrs. Tobey's desire to enjoy the\r\nsite as well as the house, the general design of the house contains\r\nfeatures specifically aimed to permit this. On the east side, the\r\nflagstone terrace and fountain pool are partially covered by the\r\noverhang of the flat roof and a trellis. On the west side of the\r\nhouse, a covered flagstone walkway from house to the carport runs\r\nbetween a hedge and fence on one side and a small courtyard with\r\nflower beds and trees on the other. In the living room added in 1957,\r\nthe only opening is a large picture window set in a bay which contains\r\na planter box with living plants.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, the house is of particular interest because its basic\r\nobjective of facilitating an indoor-outdoor style of living is\r\nachieved with simple, open lines and harmonious materials.[101] Set\r\nupon a concrete slab, the wooden walls of the house are overlaid with\r\nwooden beams placed so as to intersect and create the appearance of\r\nsquares and rectangular modules on the ceiling. A flat wooden deck\r\nroof rests on these beams. No prefabricated units were utilized in the\r\nconstruction of the house, and all pieces were individually specified,\r\ncut, and fitted together.\r\n\r\nThe architect for the Tobey House was David Condon, AIA, of Keyes,\r\nLethbridge & Condon, Washington, D.C. The landscape architect was Eric\r\nPaepcke of Washington, D.C. Interior design was done by Top Recker and\r\nPatricia Holsaert. Construction was performed by Hayes Brothers of\r\nHerndon, Virginia (figures 14 and 15).\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR FEATURES. The overall dimensions of the house are 70 by 25\r\nfeet; the carport measures 11 by 21 feet. Exterior walls are gray\r\nstained cypress, laid on horizontally in ship-lap style, with white\r\ntrim. Full-length glass panels serve as walls in the section of the\r\nhouse called \"the gallery,\" facing the terrace on the east side of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe fountain pool in the east side terrace measures 6 by 13 feet. The\r\npool water does not recirculate but is piped from the house water\r\nsupply and can be controlled by a faucet.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLOSURES. A wooden post and rail ranch fence encloses the field\r\nwhere the house is located.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPING. Pine and plane trees are planted for shade near the house\r\nand screening from the highway on the west side. Wisteria is planted\r\nfor the trellis over the terrace on the west side of the house to\r\nshield it from the afternoon sun. In the immediate vicinity of the\r\nhouse, vinca minor (periwinkle) is used as ground cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERIOR FEATURES. The Tobey House contains 2,062 square feet of floor\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nRoom arrangements for the original structure and following the\r\naddition in 1957 are shown in figure 15.\r\n\r\nInterior walls are of vertical cypress paneling, and floors are wooden\r\nparquet. Ceilings have exposed beam and plank construction.\r\n\r\nInterior features when Mrs. Tobey was in residence included wood\r\ncarvings from a Scandinavian sailing ship salvaged when it sank off\r\nthe New England Coast.\r\n\r\nWoodburning fireplaces are located in the living room of the original\r\nportion of the house (now used as a study) and the living room of the\r\n1957 addition.\r\n\r\nThe house is centrally heated with radiant heat from the floor. No\r\ncentral air conditioning was provided in the original portion; but,\r\nwhen the addition was built in 1957, central air conditioning was\r\nprovided for it and ducts were extended into the living room of the\r\noriginal portion. Window air-conditioning units were installed in the\r\nbedrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE BARN\r\n\r\nLocated approximately 200 feet northeast of the main house is a\r\ntwo-story frame barn. Its date of construction is not certain, but it\r\nis known to have been present when the Straights acquired the farm in\r\n1942. During the occupancy of the farm by the Straights, the barn was\r\nconverted into a laundry and a maid's apartment. As renovated for this\r\npurpose, the first floor of the barn contained space and equipment for\r\nthe laundry, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The second floor contained\r\nliving quarters and a bathroom. Access to the second floor was by an\r\nexterior stairway (figure 17).\r\n\r\nOverall dimensions of the barn are 14-1/2 by 24-1/2 feet. Its\r\nconstruction is frame with eight-inch siding laid on vertically and\r\ntwo-inch battens used to cover and seal the joints. The exterior is\r\nstained brown with no trim. The exterior stairway is constructed of\r\nwood and leads to a second floor entrance in the center of the east\r\nend of the building. The stairway is in two segments. One, on the\r\nsouth side, reaches from the ground to a landing at the corner of the\r\nbuilding; the other, on the east side, reaches from the landing to the\r\nentrance door. The peak of the roof is approximately 17-1/2 feet from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE LOG CABIN\r\n\r\nLocated approximately 90 feet northeast of the main house is a small\r\none-story house of log construction. Its date of construction is\r\nuncertain, although it is possible that this building is the\r\n\"Servants' House\" referred to in the notice of the commissioner's sale\r\nof the farm following the death of William Moss in 1835.[102]\r\n\r\nDuring the Straights' occupancy of the farm, the cabin was renovated\r\nand converted into a guest house. During the later years, their son,\r\nDavid, lived in the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe renovation carried out by the Straights resulted in enlargement\r\nand reframing of the windows, reconstruction of the existing door on\r\nthe west side, and reconstruction of the brick chimney at the north\r\nend of the building. At the same time, another doorway was added on\r\nthe east side (figure 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19. Spring House Floor Plans, 1960]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE SPRING HOUSE\r\n\r\nHISTORY. References to a spring house appear frequently in descriptions\r\nof Green Spring Farm during the nineteenth century.[103] The well\r\nwatered character of the farm, possessing springs of its own and\r\ntraversed by Turkey Cock Run, was an advantage of great value to all\r\nits owners. Quite possibly the presence of the springs was decisive in\r\nenabling both the Mosses and Fountain Beattie to make dairying a\r\nsubstantial part of the farm's operations. In the 1830's, many of the\r\ntypes of equipment and utensils typically used in making and preserving\r\nbutter, cheese, and fresh milk were listed in inventories of personal\r\nproperty at the farm. During this period and later, the presence of the\r\nLittle River Turnpike would have made it feasible to sell dairy\r\nproducts regularly in Alexandria, six miles away, and in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, nine miles away.[104] It is equally likely that\r\na spring house was also one of the focal points of the farm's cider\r\nand brandy-making activities at those times when the orchards\r\nflourished.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale of the farm by Fountain Beattie in 1917, the level of\r\nits operations gradually decreased. By 1940, the spring house stood\r\nunused, as neither dairying nor orchard activities were carried on.\r\nTherefore, when the Straights ordered the renovation of the main house\r\nin 1942, it was suggested that the spring house be converted into a\r\nresidence for the farm's caretaker.\r\n\r\nConversion of the spring house into a residence was carried out under\r\nthe direction of Walter Macomber of Washington, D.C., who also had\r\nbeen in charge of remodeling the main house. Using the basic stone\r\nshell of the house, which was structurally sound, a two-story house\r\nwas designed with living room, bedroom, kitchen, and utility (heater)\r\nroom on the first floor and a bedroom, bathroom, and storage area on\r\nthe second floor.[105] (See figure 19.) In this work, new materials\r\nwere used, except that slate shingles taken from the main house (where\r\nthe roof was being replaced) were used for roofing the spring house.\r\n\r\nIn 1961, the second major remodeling of the house enlarged it and\r\nattempted to reduce the dampness due to its location in the midst of\r\nthe springs. The architects for this work were Keyes, Lethbridge &\r\nCondon of Washington, D.C. As a result of this work, the roof was\r\nraised to permit construction of a new bedroom and storage room on the\r\nsecond floor. On the first floor, enclosure of a porch permitted the\r\naddition of a bathroom and closet to the downstairs bedroom.\r\nSubstantial remodeling of the kitchen was also undertaken, in which a\r\ncloset was converted into cabinets, new flooring was laid, and new\r\nkitchen fixtures were installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR. The original portion of the spring house is constructed of\r\nstone, with stucco exterior finish. The frame addition is covered with\r\nrough-sawn redwood lap siding over half-inch vapor-sealed sheathing.\r\nThe roofing for this portion of the house is slate shingles, matching\r\nthe slate roof of the original portion which used shingles taken from\r\nthe mansion house when it was renovated in 1942. Copper gutters and\r\ndownspouts were installed in 1961, as was copper flashing at the base\r\nof the chimney.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSOCIATED BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nI.

Initially it was\r\n        proposed to locate the house with its back to a line of trees\r\n        separating the upper and lower portions of the pasture west of\r\n        the main farm house. This would have taken advantage of the\r\n        view to the west of the house, considered to be its best view.\r\n        Ultimately, however, the house was located in the lower\r\n        pasture, closer to the Little River Turnpike but screened from\r\n        the highway by a line of trees planted for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  [101] _Ibid._ This is the opinion of David Condon, who served as\r\n        architect for both the original building and its subsequent\r\n        addition. He notes that the building's style was rare in the\r\n        Eastern United States, although it had appeared and was\r\n        popular on the West Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

affidavit from Thomas R. Love and Alfred Moss\r\nto Judge John Scott of the Circuit Superior Court.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon^ble John Scott Judge of the Circuit Superior Court of Law\r\nand Chancery of the County of Fairfax. Respectfully Complaining\r\nHerewith unto your Honor, your Orators Thomas R. Love guardian of\r\nCharles R. and Armistead T. Moss, and Alfred Moss guardian of Edgar\r\nand John Thomas Moss, the three first infant Children of Thomas Moss\r\ndec^d & the last named the infant son of Jno Moss dec^d son of Thomas\r\nMoss--\r\n\r\nThat Thomas Moss died intestate on the ____ day of October, 1839,\r\nleaving Seven Children and One grand Child in all his Heirs at\r\nLaw--viz. Anna R. Love the wife of your Orator Thomas R. Love, Robert\r\nMoss, Alfred Moss, Thomas Moss & the four infant Children just\r\nnamed--Edgar the Eldest of these infant Children will be 20 years old\r\nin November of the present year. Charles R. will be 18 years old in\r\nthe month of March 1840, Armistead 16 in the month of December in the\r\npresent year and John Thomas Moss will ____ years old in the month of\r\n____ 18__.\r\n\r\nThe real Estate of which Thomas Moss died seized in ____ was the tract\r\nof land on which he resided at the time of his death situated on both\r\nsides of the Little River Turnpike Road about Six miles from\r\nAlexandria containing about 320 Acres. This tract of land is the only\r\nreal Estate to which the Heirs at Law of said Thomas Moss are entitled\r\nin the said County of Fairfax or Elsewhere--This tract of land is\r\nnaturally a thin soil but from a careful course of husbandry for a\r\nnumber of years, is now in a good state of cultivation, the fields\r\nwell enclosed by good and substantial fencing, the land not in\r\ncultivation well taken with grass (clover and timothy) and that in\r\ncultivation just sown down in winter grass, and the buildings in a\r\ngood state of repair, the barn and stables having been Erected in the\r\nlast two or three years--\r\n\r\nYour orators have been advised by persons in the neighbourhood with\r\nwhom they have conversed, with the view of getting the best advice and\r\ninformation on the subject that the tract of land would not now rent\r\nfor more than ____ per annum, which would give to each of the Heirs in\r\nthe shape of rent Twenty five or Thirty dollars annually--while on the\r\nother hand owing as your Orators believe to the Convenient distance\r\nthence to Alexandria, George Town and Washington and the improved\r\nstate of the farm in other respects, it would sell upon the usual\r\nterms of Sales of land for Twenty five dollars per Acre and thus\r\nafford an interest on the sale nearly double the annual rent--In\r\naddition to the fact that the rent would greatly fall short of the\r\ninterest on the sale your orators have been advised that the property\r\nin the hands of tenants would in the course of a few years be\r\nexcessively injured and lessened in value, the soil impoverished, the\r\nbuildings and fencing neglected and suffered to delapidate perhaps\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the land cannot be advantageously divided among the\r\nheirs Eight in number it would give about forty acres to each heir,\r\nand this without regard to improvements--And the consideration deeply\r\naffecting the interests of the infant is that this farm must be rented\r\nout all the shares together manifestly--if therefore those now of age\r\nand those that soon will be of age should sell their shares each share\r\nthus sold off, will not only proportionally lessen in value the shares\r\nof the other remaining unsold, but will place the younger children as\r\nthey come of age in the power and at the mercy of the person who shall\r\nhave purchased the other shares of the co-terminus neighbour. In the\r\nEnd the consequence will be that the two or three younger children\r\nwill not only be forced to sell, being hemmed in on all sides, and not\r\nable to add to their Inheritance but must sell at any price they are\r\noffered. Your orators further state that besides the real Estate\r\nbefore mentioned in which their wards have as interest One Eighth\r\neach, after the payment of the debts of Thomas Moss deceased so far as\r\nit is practicable to make an Estimate at this time, it is believed\r\nthat a surplus will be left for distribution of about fifteen or\r\nsixteen thousand dollars, which will give to each child say two\r\nthousand--\r\n\r\nViewing the present interest as well as the future interests of their\r\nwards your orators are of the opinion from the facts hereinbefore\r\nstated, that the interests of their wards manifestly require a sale of\r\nthe real Estate herein before mentioned and that the rights of others\r\nwill not be thereby violated. And to that end and in pursuance of the\r\nActs of the Gen'l Assembly in such cases made and provided, they pray\r\nthat said Anna R. Love late Anna R. Moss, Alfred Moss, Robert, Thomas\r\nEdgar, Charles R., Armistead and John Thomas Moss be made parties\r\ndefendants to this bill--that the said Anna R. Love the wife of your\r\norator and Alfred Moss who would be two of the Heirs of either of said\r\ninfants if they are dead and that said Anna R. be permitted to answer\r\nfor herself as if feme sole. That the said Anna R. Love, Robert Moss,\r\nAlfred Moss, Thomas Moss and all the other infants herein before\r\nmentioned who are over fourteen years of age may be compelled to\r\nanswer this bill in proper person or oath--That a Guardian Ad Litem\r\nmay be appointed according to Law to defend and answer for those\r\ninfants as well those over fourteen years, as those under fourteen\r\nyears of age.--That your orators may have a Decree of the Ct\r\nauthorizing the sale of the said land in such manner and upon such\r\nterms of credit as to your Honor may seem right--And your orators pray\r\nfor all other & further action by your Honor in the premises as may be\r\nright & proper according to the Act of assembly made and provided in\r\nsuch cases--May it please your honor &c.\r\n\r\n(Certified by J. B. Hunter, a Justice of the Peace, 29 October 1839)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix F\r\n\r\nFairfax County (Va.)

While in the USSR, they say, Americans\r\n  are lavish with their praise, but on returning home, they speak\r\n  quite differently of Russia to their fellow Americans. Our\r\n  newspapers in turn maintain that Soviet delegations to this\r\n  country wear a mask of friendliness but once back in Russia\r\n  present a hostile and unrecognizable picture of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n  Do visiting Soviet delegations present a true picture of their\r\n  travels here to their own people? The editors of _The NR_ have\r\n  been given an opportunity to test this question. A delegation of\r\n  leading Soviet writers visited the United States in October, 1955,\r\n  under the chairmanship of Boris Kampov-Polevoy, a Soviet novelist\r\n  and Secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers. Mr. Polevoy and four\r\n  members of his delegation spent one evening at the house of the\r\n  _NR_ editor-at-large. In the third of his articles on his journeys\r\n  through the US published in the March issue of the Soviet monthly,\r\n  _Oktyabr_, Mr. Polevoy describes the occasion as he remembers it.\r\n  A translation of his article, and our comments follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening we were invited to be the guests of Mr. Michael\r\nStraight, editor of the magazine _The New Republic_, at his\r\nout-of-town villa bearing the poetic name of \"Green Spring Farm.\" This\r\ntiny villa was in no way different from the small suburban houses of\r\nwell-to-do members of the \"intelligentsia\" which we already had the\r\nopportunity of visiting. Alone the huge agglomeration of books on long\r\nshelves--quite unusual for an American home--and the beautiful\r\npictures on the walls revealed that the owners of this house had a\r\npassion for literature and an artistic taste which could enable them\r\nto discriminate between works of genuine art and the militant\r\nflatness, which under the mask of innovationism has impertinently\r\nseized the key positions in American art. There were canvasses and\r\ndrawings which not only prompted one to wonder on passing by, but\r\nwhich induced a desire to stop, to admire and to think.\r\n\r\nThe people who had gathered at the house were interesting too--journalists\r\nwho had traveled a great deal, who had witnessed many events, who were\r\nable to think. A unionist leader was also present--an observing,\r\naggressive, skeptical man.\r\n\r\nAt the outset--as it is the custom in the United States--the host\r\nshowed us around his house. The five of us were jammed in for quite a\r\nwhile on the second floor in the tiny bedrooms of his two sons. David,\r\nthe eldest, a fair-haired, healthy looking youngster, had his little\r\nroom in a state of complete disorder. The radio was roaring, the gay\r\ngreen parakeets were screaming. Some radio parts together with books,\r\nscrewdrivers, tubes of glue, bookbinders and knives were heaped on the\r\ntable. The little occupant, apparently ready to go to bed, was sitting\r\non his bed without his shirt and was reading something. At the sight\r\nof strangers he felt bashful, grabbed his shirt, started putting it on\r\nand when his head eventually emerged through its collar, his face and\r\nhis ears were flushed and his brow pearled with sweat. However, having\r\ndressed, he immediately regained his composure and, as though nothing\r\nhad happened, stretched out his hand with earnest poise. David--he\r\nintroduced himself.\r\n\r\nHis younger brother, Mikey, had an artistic temperament. His table was\r\nall smeared with water-colors and pictures were hanging on the\r\nwalls--fantastic tanks, ships, sinister profiles of Indians,\r\nnoble-featured cowboys wearing hats of incredible dimensions. Mikey\r\nwas evidently successful in this hobby of his and, after looking at\r\nhis drawings, one could tell him without false flattery that he was an\r\nartist of the realist school and that many of his pictures were more\r\naccurate and perfect as to form than whatever is being exhibited by\r\nquite adult \"uncles\" at the opening of exhibitions of the so-called\r\n\"new art.\"\r\n\r\nMikey dressed, too, and we came down in a group to the living room\r\nwhere Gribatchov was having an argument with our American colleagues.\r\nThe topic was familiar, I should even say a classical one--the freedom\r\nof the press. In the heat of the dispute the _NR_ publisher proposed\r\nto Gribatchov an exchange of articles on important international\r\ntopics under reciprocal terms--once a week the editor of _The New\r\nRepublic_ would publish an article in the _Literary Gazette_\r\npresenting the American viewpoint on some specific problem and once a\r\nweek a representative of the _Literary Gazette_ would give the Soviet\r\npoint of view in an article in _The New Republic_. Apparently this\r\nidea seemed very attractive to our American colleague, and he was\r\nattacking Gribatchov with quite a lot of energy.\r\n\r\nI did not have a chance to hear the argument to its end. The\r\nfair-haired David, with whom I had become quite friendly, dragged me\r\naway to the next room. We conversed in the manner of cavemen, using\r\ndramatic gesticulations and incoherent sounds, and yet we somehow\r\nmanaged to understand each other. David even managed to convey that he\r\nhad built that radio himself, and that he likes to listen to Russian\r\nmusic. In proof of this he even sang, with boyish diligence and with a\r\nbroken juvenile \"basso,\" a melody taken out of _Swan Lake_. However,\r\nhe rendered it with a foxtrot rhythm.\r\n\r\nI really liked that lively American youngster with his tall build, his\r\ncurly fair hair, his rooster-like voice and his absent-minded\r\ndisposition which strongly reminded me of my eldest son.\r\n\r\nDavid showed me his favorite books, and then he suddenly produced a\r\npeculiar-looking magazine printed with a multigraph. He prodded his\r\nchest in a self-satisfied manner to demonstrate to me that this was\r\nhis own magazine. He showed me a caricature drawing with his finger\r\nand then pointed his finger at Mikey, thus making clear that his\r\nbrother was the artist.\r\n\r\nThen the children ran back to the living room and came back dragging\r\ntheir father with them and M. M. Lopuchin, whom they had literally\r\nabducted out of an interesting conversation with the ladies. It was\r\nthen that I came to hear the story of the magazine, which bore the\r\nromantic name _The Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMichael senior, the children's father, evidently liked their\r\nundertaking. He sat down on the carpet next to us and as he was\r\nturning the pages of the magazine, he told us that out of a wish to\r\nimitate their father, the children had decided to start a publication.\r\nThey wrote articles and other items, prepared illustrations and\r\ncaricatures and arranged the whole material inside a copybook. They\r\nkept quiet so long that their parents wondered what their rowdy boys\r\nwere doing. The parents went upstairs and found the boys busy over a\r\nheap of papers; the _Gazette_ was already being \"paged up.\"\r\n\r\nDavid, the editor of the publication, knew from his father's\r\nexperience that every printed organ must have readers. The children\r\nbegged their father to give them a typewriter and when they got it,\r\nbegan to type patiently, with one finger, one page after the other,\r\nlearning the art of typing in the process of their work.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the children's interest did not abate, the father gave\r\nthem a present--a cheap toy \"Shapirograph\"--to print their magazine.\r\nHaving secured production equipment, the editorial staff began to work\r\nwith renewed energy. David, who up to that time was sharing his\r\ninterest among many pursuits, forsook his former preferences. Even the\r\nlittle green parakeets, whom he loved dearly, were left without food\r\nquite often and sadly chattered in their cage. David had the jobs of\r\neditor, author of articles and typographer. The sturdy Mikey was the\r\npublisher, artist and supplier of funny stories. A neighbor's little\r\ngirl, Xandra Babel, was responsible for the news and special\r\nevents--indispensable departments of every American editorial unit\r\nworthy of this name.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, no matter how, the magazine eventually appeared. It was\r\neven printed in 75 copies, diligently bound and, the following year\r\nwhen the family left for the beach during the hot season, to the\r\nmother's great dismay, the whole issue and even the typographic\r\nequipment consisting of the typewriter and the multigraph as well as\r\nthe paper stocks were taken along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boris Kampov-Polevoy]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the children made friends with a certain Mr. Zur, an\r\noriginal character and owner of the Menemsha store. The old man liked\r\nchildren and whenever they came to his shop to buy candy, salted nuts\r\nor a bag of popcorn, they always used to stay there for a while and\r\ndiscuss the weather, politics and all sorts of events with him. Mr.\r\nZur used to talk to children as though they were grownups, and this\r\ncontributed a lot to his popularity. When they arrived at the summer\r\nresort, the first thing the children did was to run to their old\r\nfriend's shop and there, as they were eating fresh cracking popcorn,\r\nthey told him the staggering news--they had published a magazine.\r\n\r\n\"A magazine? And how much costs one copy of your magazine, gentlemen?\"\r\ninquired Mr. Zur in a businesslike manner.\r\n\r\nThe children exchanged quick glances. Somehow they had not arrived at\r\nthe thought that their magazine could be sold.\r\n\r\n\"It costs nothing, sir,\" David started saying.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it costs one dollar,\" the quick-witted Mikey interrupted his\r\nbrother as this new aspect of their hobby began to dawn upon him. \"One\r\ndollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather expensive, gentlemen. However, I enjoy reading, and so I\r\nwill buy one copy,\" replied the old shopkeeper and handed over a dirty\r\ngreen bill to the journalists. They were left quite speechless by this\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe business was continued. Realizing that there were quite a few\r\nfunny people among the dwellers in that summer resort and wishing to\r\nplease his little friends, old Zur took over the newsstand sale of\r\ntheir publication on a commission basis. He even displayed the\r\nmagazine in his shop window. To his astonishment, the whole of the\r\nfirst issue was sold out. Four more followed. By the end of the\r\nsummer, the boys' income, after deduction of expenses and commissions,\r\namounted to roughly $50. The children gave this money--not without\r\nsome regret, to be truthful--to the local fishermen whose boats had\r\nbeen shattered against the rocks of the coast by a passing hurricane.\r\n\r\nInspired by the unexpected success of their first year's operations,\r\nthe editorial staff resumed publication in the following summer at\r\nthat same resort. It proved even more interesting. It contained\r\ninterviews with fishermen and lobstermen and a story told by an old\r\ncaptain of a fishing schooner, who was spending his declining years in\r\na dilapidated shack by the seashore. That huge, hoarse, bearded giant\r\nwas always drunk. But in his rare moments of sobriety he was kind,\r\nused to give candy to the children and nobody could tell fascinating\r\nsea adventure stories better than he did. Mikey managed to catch him\r\nin such a mood and the magazine was adorned, as a result, with a\r\npowerful story by the old captain about a hurricane that threw ships\r\naround like bits of paper and about the rescue of a beautiful lady\r\npassenger who had been thrown into the ocean by the roaring gale, by\r\nthe captain himself, who saved her out of the waves at the risk of his\r\nown life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe children's hobby, which so clearly demonstrated their propensity\r\ntoward journalism, greatly interested us. During our visits with\r\nvarious American families our attention had been drawn more than once\r\nto this good trait--if indeed it is not a tradition--which makes the\r\nchildren familiarize themselves with the profession of their father,\r\nor their grandfather, or some close relative. In the apartment of an\r\nauto-mechanic we saw a small lathe and a block on which a little\r\nfellow was filing something. In the family of a musician, little girls\r\nplayed on the violin. The little son of a well-known Hollywood\r\nscenario-creator told us excitedly how he and his little brothers and\r\nsisters were making a film. A child's game gradually develops into an\r\nabsorbing interest, and maybe in these games which are treated\r\nseriously, not only by the children but as a rule by the adults too,\r\nthe seed of his future profession is planted in the child's brain.\r\n\r\nI expressed the wish to become a subscriber to the _Green Spring-Menemsha\r\nGazette_ for a full year and took out a $5 bill. The editor and the\r\npublisher exchanged glances. They obviously wished to get a foreign\r\nsubscriber. But what if this should create trouble of some kind? Were\r\nthey entitled to mail their magazine abroad, and moreover, to a country\r\nlike the USSR? What would their father and mother say? And how would Mr.\r\nJohn Foster Dulles react?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette]\r\n\r\nDavid carefully pushed the bill away, back to my end of the table. I,\r\nof course, felt offended. Could it be that I had no right to subscribe\r\nto an American magazine? Why such discrimination? The editor whispered\r\nsomething to the publisher who ran out of the room and came back\r\ndragging Michael senior in once more. The father laughed. He\r\napparently had no objection to the mailing abroad of the magazine\r\nwhich was being published under his sponsorship. All the periodical\r\npublications of good standing always have foreign subscribers.\r\nHowever, Michael senior had objections against any monetary\r\ntransaction with countries abroad. It was agreed that the subscription\r\nwould be handled on a clearing basis: the _Green Spring-Menemsha\r\nGazette_ would be mailed to the USSR in exchange for our children's\r\nmagazine _The Pioneer_. We shook hands on this transaction, concluded\r\nto the mutual satisfaction of the \"high contracting parties.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the living room, the debate about the freedom of\r\nthe press was still continuing. But the two sides had exchanged\r\nplaces. Gribatchov was the one who led the attack now; the idea of\r\nexchanging articles with _The New Republic_ had gradually excited him.\r\nPublisher Harrison, on the contrary, was taking a defensive stand: he\r\nwas already foreseeing numerous difficulties obstructing the\r\nmaterialization of his project. The unionist leader was sitting on the\r\nsofa next to them. He was a tall man with a pale face with an ironical\r\nexpression, and he was gently mocking the discomfited publisher.\r\n\"Really, why shouldn't there be an exchange of articles with a Russian\r\npaper?\"\r\n\r\nSo finally they came to no conclusion at all.\r\n\r\nWe were taking our seats in the car when David manfully shook hands\r\nwith me and suddenly asked: \"Maybe you will write from Moscow a\r\ncontribution for publication in _The Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette_?\r\nOur magazine will gladly publish it, I can promise you.\"\r\n\r\nMy negotiations with the editors of the _Gazette_ appeared to be more\r\nfruitful than the ones Gribatchov had had with _The New Republic_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 16, 1956\r\n\r\nEditors' Note:\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, some errors in Mr. Polevoy's story. Many are\r\ndue, as he notes, to the fact that parts of the conversation were\r\nconducted through dramatic gesticulations and incoherent sounds. Bill\r\nSeward, the youthful proprietor of Menemsha's post office and store,\r\nfor example, may not recognize himself as the ancient Mr. Zur, and the\r\nauthor of Cassandra Bobble, a fictional caricature of society\r\ncolumnists, will be surprised to see her creation re-emerge in Russian\r\nas Xandra Babel the neighbor's girl reporter. More substantial, in the\r\neditor's opinion, is his view that it was Mr. Gribatchov and not Mr.\r\nHarrison who doubted the practicality of an exchange of articles. And\r\nyet as many errors of detail and interpretation would no doubt be\r\nfound were we to describe an evening spent in Mr. Polevoy's villa\r\noutside Moscow. As far as the general tone of Mr. Polevoy's account is\r\nconcerned we cannot complain.\r\n\r\nMr. Polevoy, after all, is describing an evening in the home of an\r\nopponent of the political administration in power. Soviet readers learn\r\nthat it is a comfortable place, lived in by a family substantially\r\nfree from fear. The author refers in a mocking way to the shadow of\r\nJohn Foster Dulles and mentions the reluctance of the boys to take his\r\n$5 (the reason, lost in translation, was that they would not be\r\npublishing their paper in 1956). But just as Mr. Polevoy seems about\r\nto conclude with a political moral, he demolishes this traditional\r\nending in favor of the truth. For the discussion which Mr. Polevoy\r\ndescribes ended with a whispered aside which the host found\r\nstartling. \"We will put you on the subscriber's list to _The\r\nPioneer_!\" Mr. Polevoy had roared to the boys; then he drew their\r\nfather aside: \"That is, if it will not hurt you,\" he whispered. The\r\nhost laughed and explained that he and his sons were free citizens,\r\nable to read whatever they pleased and happy to receive literature from\r\nother lands. It seems gratifying to us that this small but memorable\r\nincident has found its way into the Soviet press.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL STRAIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SOURCE MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\nClarke, E.; Potts, J.
