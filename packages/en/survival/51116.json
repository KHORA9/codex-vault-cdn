Gould, of the University of Michigan, was the first to recognize the\r\ngeologic and scenic values of the Arches area in eastern Utah and to\r\nurge its creation as a national monument. Mrs. Faun McConkie Tanner[1]\r\ntold me that Professor Gould, who had done a thesis problem in the\r\nnearby La Sal Mountains, was first taken through the area by Marv\r\nTurnbow, third owner of Wolfe cabin. (See p. 12.) When Professor Gould\r\nwent into ecstasy over the beautiful scenery, Turnbow replied, “I didn’t\r\nknow there was anything unusual about it.”\r\n\r\nDr. J. W. Williams, generally regarded as father of the monument, and L.\r\nL. (Bish) Taylor, of the Moab Times-Independent, were the local leaders\r\nin following up on Gould’s suggestion and, with the help of the Moab\r\nLions Club, their efforts finally succeeded on April 12, 1929, when\r\nPresident Herbert Hoover proclaimed Arches National Monument, then\r\ncomprising only 7 square miles.[2] It was enlarged to about 53 square\r\nmiles by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Proclamation of November 25,\r\n1938, and remained at nearly that size, with some boundary adjustments\r\non July 22, 1960, until it was enlarged to about 130 square miles by\r\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson’s Proclamation of January 20, 1969.\r\n\r\nAccording to Breed (1947), Harry Goulding, of Monument Valley, in a\r\nspecially equipped car, traversed the rugged sand and rocks of the\r\nArches region in the fall of 1936 and, thus, became the first person to\r\ndrive a car into The Windows section of Arches National Monument. Soon\r\nafter, a bulldozer followed Harry’s tracks and made a passable trail.\r\n\r\nWhen my family and I visited the monument in 1946, the entrance was\r\nabout 12 miles northwest of Moab on U.S. Highway 163 (then U.S. 160),\r\nwhere Goulding’s old tire tracks led eastward past a small sign reading\r\n“Arches National Monument 8 miles.” This primitive road crossed the\r\nsandy, normally dry Courthouse Wash and ended in what is now called The\r\nWindows section. At that time there was no water or ranger station, nor\r\nwere there any picnic tables or other improvements within the monument\r\nproper, and the custodian was housed in an old barracks of the Civilian\r\nConservation Corps near what is now the entrance, 5 miles northwest of\r\nMoab.\r\n\r\nFormer Custodian Russell L. Mahan reported (oral commun., May 1973) that\r\nsoon after our initial visit in 1946 a 500-gallon tank was installed\r\nnear Double Arch in The Windows section and connected to a drinking\r\nfountain and that two picnic tables and a pit toilet were added. At that\r\ntime the only access to Salt Valley and what is now called Devils Garden\r\nwas a primitive dirt road which, according to Breed (1947, p. 175), left\r\nold U.S. Highway 160 (now U.S. 163) 24 miles northwest of Moab, went 22\r\nmiles east, then followed Salt Valley Wash down to Wolfe cabin (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAccording to Abbey (1971), who served as a seasonal ranger beginning\r\nabout 1958, a sign had by then been erected at the crossing of\r\nCourthouse Wash which read:\r\n\r\n                           WARNING: QUICKSAND\r\n                           DO NOT CROSS WASH\r\n                         WHEN WATER IS RUNNING\r\n\r\nThe ranger station, his home for 6 months of the year, was what Abbey\r\ndescribed as “a little tin housetrailer.” Nearby was an information\r\ndisplay under a “lean-to shelter.” He had propane fuel for heat,\r\ncooking, and refrigeration, and a small gasoline-engine-driven generator\r\nfor lights at night. His water came from the 500-gallon tank, which was\r\nfilled at intervals from a tank truck. At that time there were three\r\nsmall dry campgrounds, each with tables, fireplaces, garbage cans, and\r\npit toilets. By that time an extension of the dirt road led northward to\r\nDevils Garden, and some trails had been built and marked.\r\n\r\nBates Wilson became Custodian of the monument in 1949 and later became\r\nSuperintendent not only of Arches but also of the nearby new Canyonlands\r\nNational Park (Lohman, 1974) and the more distant Natural Bridges\r\nNational Monument. In the fall of 1969, Bates told me of some of his\r\nearly experiences in the undeveloped monument, including the evening\r\nwhen 22 cars were marooned on the wrong (northeast) side of Courthouse\r\nWash after a flash flood. Bates and his “lone” ranger brought ropes,\r\ncoffee, and what food they could obtain in town after closing time,\r\nthrew a line across the swollen stream, had a tourist pull a rope\r\nacross, then took turns wading the stream with one hand on the rope and\r\nthe other balancing supplies on his shoulder. After a fire had been\r\nbuilt and hot coffee and food passed around, the spirits of the stranded\r\ngroup rose considerably, except for one irate woman from the East, who\r\nrefused to budge from her car. Bates and his helper finally got the last\r\ncar out about 1 a.m., after the flood had subsided, and Mrs. Wilson then\r\nsupplied lodging and more food and coffee for those who needed it.\r\n\r\nDuring and for sometime after World War II and the Korean War, lack of\r\nmaintenance funds and personnel had prevented improvement of the\r\nfacilities in many of our national parks and monuments, particularly in\r\nundeveloped ones like Arches. The day was saved through the wisdom and\r\nforesight of former Park Service Director Conrad L. Wirth, who saw the\r\nneed and desirability of putting the whole “want” list into one\r\nattractive, marketable package. In the words of Everhart (1972, p. 36):\r\n\r\n  Selection of a name is of course recognized as the most important\r\n  decision in any large-scale enterprise, and here Wirth struck pure\r\n  gold. In 1966 the Park Service would be celebrating its fiftieth\r\n  anniversary. What a God-given target to shoot for! Why not produce a\r\n  ten-year program, which would begin in 1956, aimed to bring every park\r\n  up to standard by 1966—and call it Mission 66?\r\n\r\nThe ensuing well-documented and cost-estimated plan for Mission 66 was\r\nenthusiastically backed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and approved\r\nand well supported by Congress to the tune of more than $1 billion\r\nduring the 10-year period. For Arches, this included a new entrance,\r\nPark Headquarters, Visitor Center, a museum boasting a bust of founder\r\nDr. Williams, and modern housing for park personnel, all 5 miles\r\nnorthwest of Moab. By 1958 (Pierson, 1960) a fine new paved road between\r\nPark Headquarters and Balanced Rock (frontispiece) was completed. These\r\nbadly needed improvements were followed by the completion of the paved\r\nroad all the way to Devils Garden, the building of the modern\r\ncampground, picnic facilities, and amphitheater in the Devils Garden,\r\nand the construction of turnouts and marked trails.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduation to a Park\r\n\r\n\r\nArches graduated to a full-fledged national park when President Richard\r\nM. Nixon signed a Congressional Bill on November 16, 1971. The change in\r\nstatus was accompanied by boundary changes that reduced the area to\r\nabout 114 square miles. The loss of most of Dry Mesa, just east of the\r\npresent boundary (fig. 1), was offset in part by gains of new land\r\nnorthwest of Devils Garden. The present (1974) boundaries, roads,\r\ntrails, and named features of the park are shown in figure 1.\r\n\r\nThe park was virtually completed at graduation time, and so far this\r\nchange in status has shown up mainly in new entrance signs, a new 1972\r\nbrochure and map, and a very informative “Guide to an Auto Tour of\r\nArches National Park,” keyed to numbered signs at parking spaces. About\r\nall that remain to be added are new wayside exhibits, some boundary\r\nfences, and spur roads and trails.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ARCHES NATIONAL PARK, showing location in Utah,\r\n    boundaries, streams, highways and roads, trails, landforms,\r\n    principal named features, and the city of Moab. The reader is\r\n    referred to figure 7 and to road maps issued by the State or by oil\r\n    companies for the locations of other nearby towns and features.\r\n    Visitors also may obtain pamphlets, from the entrance station or\r\n    from the National Park Service office in Moab, which contain\r\n    up-to-date maps of the park and the latest available information on\r\n    roads, trails, campsites, and picnic sites. (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\nAlthough Arches had officially become a park in November 1971, it was\r\nnot formally dedicated until May 15, 1972. The ceremony began by having\r\nthe Federal, State, and local dignitaries and other guests totaling 140\r\npersons board the _Canyon King_, a 93-foot replica of a Mississippi\r\nRiver sternwheeler (Lansford, 1972; Lohman, 1974, fig. 69), for its\r\nmaiden voyage down the Colorado River. After about half an hour, the\r\nheavily laden boat became stuck on a sandbar, and after a 90-minute wait\r\nthe passengers were rescued by jet boats. This delayed a luncheon at the\r\nVisitor Center put on by the Moab Lions Club. Following the luncheon,\r\nPark Superintendent Bates Wilson made a brief welcoming address, then\r\nintroduced J. Leonard Volz, Director of the Midwest Region of the\r\nNational Park Service, who served as master of ceremonies. Speakers\r\nincluded Utah Governor Calvin L. Rampton, Senator Frank E. Moss, a\r\nrepresentative of Senator Wallace F. Bennett, Representatives Sherman P.\r\nLloyd of Utah and Wayne Aspinall of Colorado, and Mitchell Melich,\r\nSolicitor General of the Department of Interior, representing Secretary\r\nRogers C. B. Morton. After the speeches, a commemorative plaque, donated\r\nby the Canyonlands Natural History Association, was unveiled by Senator\r\nMoss and Mr. Melich.\r\n\r\nMost of the color photographs were taken by me on 4- × 5-inch film in a\r\ntripod-mounted press camera, using lenses of several focal lengths, but\r\na few were taken on 35-mm film, using lenses of various focal lengths. I\r\nam grateful to several friends for the color photographs credited to\r\nthem in the figure captions. The black and white photographs were kindly\r\nloaned from the Moab and Arches files of the National Park Service. The\r\npoints from which most of the photographs were taken are shown in figure\r\n13.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly History\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Prehistoric People\r\n\r\nThe Canyon lands in and south of Arches were inhabited by cliff dwellers\r\ncenturies before the first visits of the Spaniards and fur trappers.\r\nProjectile points and other artifacts found in the nearby La Sal and\r\nAbajo Mountains indicate occupation by aborigines during the period from\r\nabout 3000-2000 B.C. to about A.D. 1 (Hunt, Alice, 1956). The Fremont\r\npeople occupied the area around A.D. 850 or 900, and the Pueblo or\r\nAnasazi people from about A.D. 1075 to their departure in the late 12th\r\ncentury (Jennings, 1970). Most of the evidence for these early\r\noccupations has been found in and south of Canyonlands National Park\r\n(Lohman, 1974), but some traces of these and possibly earlier cultures\r\nhave been found also within Arches National Park.\r\n\r\nRoss A. Maxwell (National Park Service, written commun., 1941)\r\ninvestigated two caves in the Entrada Sandstone in the upper reaches of\r\nSalt Wash that contain Anasazi ruins. He mentioned that perhaps a dozen\r\nor more other caves should be checked for evidence of former occupation\r\nand, also, that he found several ancient campsites littered with flint\r\nchips and broken tools.\r\n\r\nOne cave Maxwell explored some 5 miles north of Wolfe Ranch and north of\r\nthe park is about 300 feet long and 100 to 150 feet deep. It contains\r\nthe remains of one or more ruins of a structure he thought may have\r\ncovered much of the floor. The remaining parts of walls now are only two\r\nto four tiers of stones in height, although originally they may have\r\nbeen more than one story high. Maxwell explored a second cave on the\r\neast side of Salt Wash, about 2 miles north of Wolfe Ranch, which\r\ncontains 16 storage cists of adobe.\r\n\r\nThe faces of many older sandstone cliffs or ledges are darkened by\r\ndesert varnish—a natural pigment of iron and manganese oxides. The\r\nprehistoric inhabitants of the Plateau learned that effective and\r\nenduring designs, called petroglyphs, could be created simply by\r\nchiseling or pecking through the thin dark layer to reveal the buff or\r\ntan sandstone beneath. Most petroglyphs were created by the Anasazi, but\r\nthose showing men mounted on horses were done by Ute tribesmen after the\r\nSpaniards brought in horses in the 1500’s. The Fremont people and some\r\nearlier people painted figures on rock faces, called pictographs, and\r\nsome of these had pecked outlines.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “Moab panel” was described by Beckwith (1934, p. 177) as a\r\npetroglyph, but, as pointed out by Schaafsma (1971, p. 72, 73), it\r\ncomprises figures having pecked outlines and painted bodies, which\r\nactually are combinations of petroglyphs and pictographs. This\r\nbeautifully preserved group of paintings is shown in the upper\r\nphotograph of figure 2. Mrs. Schaafsma goes on to say, concerning the\r\n“Moab panel”:\r\n\r\n  The long tapered body, the antenna like headdresses, and the staring\r\n  eyes are characteristic features of Barrier Canyon style figures\r\n  elsewhere * * *. Of special interest here are the large shields held\r\n  by certain figures. A visit to this site indicated that the shields,\r\n  although apparently of some antiquity, have been superimposed over\r\n  some of the Barrier Canyon figures. Whether or not this was done by\r\n  the Barrier Canyon style artists themselves or later comers to the\r\n  site is impossible to tell.\r\n\r\nAlthough definite proof seems lacking, she suggested (written commun.,\r\nNov. 3, 1973) that the “‘Barrier Canyon style’[3] * * * is earlier than\r\nthe work in the same region clearly attributable to the Fremont.” Note\r\nthe three bullet holes in and near the right-hand shield. A ledge above\r\nthe panel that contained petroglyphs during her earlier visit had fallen\r\nto the base of the cliff by the time my wife and I inspected the panel\r\nin September 1973.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROCK ART IN ARCHES NATIONAL PARK. A (above), “Moab\r\n    panel,” on cliff of Wingate Sandstone above U.S. Highway 163 between\r\n    Courthouse Wash and Colorado River, believed to be the work of\r\n    “Barrier Canyon” style people. B (below), Petroglyphs on ledge of\r\n    sandstone in Morrison Formation on east side of Salt Wash just north\r\n    of Wolfe Ranch, believed to have been cut by Ute tribesmen. (Fig.\r\n    2)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2 B]\r\n\r\nMrs. Schaafsma believes the petroglyphs in the lower photograph of\r\nfigure 2 to be the work of Ute tribesmen, not only because of the\r\nhorses, but also because of the stiff-legged appearance of the mountain\r\nsheep. Note the bullet hole above the panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Late Arrivals\r\n\r\nLater arrivals in and near Arches National Park included first Spanish\r\nexplorers, then trappers, cattlemen, cattle rustlers and horse thieves,\r\nfollowed in the present century by oil drillers, uranium hunters,\r\njeepsters, and tourists. Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other\r\nmembers of The Wild Bunch are known to have frequented parts of what is\r\nnow Canyonlands National Park (Baker, Pearl, 1971), but it is not\r\ncertain whether or not any of them traversed what is now Arches National\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nThe first settler in what is now Arches National Park was a Civil War\r\nveteran named John Wesley Wolfe, who was discharged from the Union Army\r\nabout 3 weeks before the Battle of Bull Run because he suffered from\r\nvaricose veins. In 1888 his doctor told him he had to leave Ohio for a\r\ndryer climate or he would not live 6 months, so he took his son Fred\r\nwest and settled on a tract of 150 acres along the west bank of Salt\r\nWash, where his “Wolfe cabin” still stands (figs. 1, 3). From family\r\nletters and newspaper clippings compiled by Mrs. Maxine Newell and other\r\nmembers of the National Park Service (Maxine Newell, written commun.,\r\n1971), we learn what life in the area was like:\r\n\r\n  We have started a cattle spread on a desert homestead. We call it the\r\n  Bar-DX Ranch. Fred and I live in a little log house on the bank of a\r\n  creek that is sometimes dry, sometimes flooded from bank to bank with\r\n  roaring muddy water. We are surrounded with rocks—gigantic red rock\r\n  formations, massive arches and weird figures, the like of which youve\r\n  [sic] never seen. The desert is a hostile, demanding country, hot in\r\n  summer, cold in winter. The Bar-DX Ranch is a day’s ride from the\r\n  nearest store, out of the range of schools.\r\n\r\nAlthough John Wolfe had promised his wife and his other children that he\r\nwould return home the first fall that his cattle sales netted enough\r\nmoney, he and Fred stayed on and on, and his wife refused to go west and\r\njoin her husband and son. Eighteen years later he sent money from his\r\npension check to his daughter, Mrs. Flora Stanley, his son-in-law, Ed\r\nStanley, and his two grandchildren, Esther and Ferol, to join him and\r\nFred at the ranch. Their train was met at Thompson Springs (now\r\nThompson), Utah (fig. 7), by John Wolfe for the 30-mile ride to the\r\nranch by horse and wagon. Sight of the tiny log cabin with only a dirt\r\nfloor brought tears to his daughter’s eyes, but her spirits rose\r\nconsiderably after John Wolfe promised to build a new log cabin with a\r\nwooden floor. But the children were enchanted with this strange country,\r\nwith the building of the new cabin, and, especially, with getting to go\r\nrabbit hunting with Grandpa Wolfe. The Stanleys stayed at the ranch\r\nuntil Esther was 10, then moved to Moab to await the arrival of their\r\nthird child, Volna.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 John Wolfe sold the Bar-DX Ranch, and the entire family moved to\r\nKansas. John Wolfe later moved back to Ohio, and died at Etna, Licking\r\nCounty, on October 22, 1913, at the age of 84, 25 years after his doctor\r\nhad warned him to move to a dryer climate or face an early death.\r\n\r\nWolfe had sold his spread to Tommy Larson, who later sold it to J. Marv\r\nTurnbow and his partners, Lester Walker and Stib Beeson. The old log\r\ncabin gradually came to be known as the “Turnbow cabin,” and this name\r\nappeared on early maps of the area by the U.S. Geological Survey and on\r\nearly pamphlets by the National Park Service, partly because Marv\r\nTurnbow served as a camphand in 1927 assisting in the first detailed\r\ngeologic mapping of the area (Dane, 1935, p. 4). In 1947 the ranch was\r\nsold to Emmett Elizondo, who later sold it to the Government for\r\ninclusion in what was then the monument.\r\n\r\nFrom information supplied by Wolfe’s granddaughter, Mrs. Esther Stanley\r\nRison, and his great-granddaughter, Mrs. Hazel Wolfe Hastler, who\r\nvisited the cabin in July 1970, the original name Wolfe cabin, or Wolfe\r\nRanch, has been restored, and appears on the newer maps and pamphlets.\r\n(See fig. 1.) What remains of Wolfe’s Bar-DX Ranch is shown in figure 3.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOLFE’S BAR-DX RANCH, on west bank of Salt Wash at\r\n    start of trail to Delicate Arch. Left to right: Corral, wagon, “new”\r\n    cabin, and root cellar. “Old” cabin, which formerly was to right of\r\n    photograph, was washed away by a flood in 1906. (Fig. 3)]\r\n\r\nArches National Park is surrounded by active uranium and vanadium mines\r\nand by many test wells for oil, gas, and potash; it is underlain by\r\nextensive salt and potash deposits. Oil and gas are produced a few miles\r\nto the north and east, and potash is being produced about 12 miles to\r\nthe south (Lohman, 1974).\r\n\r\nUranium and vanadium have been mined on the Colorado Plateau since 1898\r\n(Dane, 1935, p. 176) and in the Yellow Cat area (also called Thompson’s\r\narea), just north of the park (fig. 1), since about 1911 (Stokes, 1952,\r\np. 7). The deposits in the Yellow Cat area occur in the Salt Wash\r\nSandstone Member of the Morrison Formation (fig. 4). According to Pete\r\nBeroni (U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, oral commun., August 6, 1973),\r\nsome ore is still being produced in the Yellow Cat area, and the\r\nproduction of vanadium ore will increase as soon as the uranium mill at\r\nMoab is converted to also handle vanadium ore. The Corral and so-called\r\nShinarump mines along the southwest side of Moab Canyon just north of\r\nSevenmile Canyon (fig. 1) are still actively producing uranium ore from\r\nthe Moss Back Member of the Chinle Formation, according to Mr. Beroni.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of salt and potash in and near the park and the attempts\r\nto find oil and gas nearby are discussed in a recent report (Hite and\r\nLohman, 1973), and the deposits beneath Moab, Salt, and Cache Valleys\r\nare discussed in later chapters.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 and 1956 the Pacific Northwest Pipeline, known also as the\r\n“Scenic Inch,” was constructed by the Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp.\r\nto transmit natural gas from wells in the San Juan Basin of northwestern\r\nNew Mexico for a total of 1,487 miles to the Pacific Northwest, with\r\nadditional pickups from gas fields in northeastern Utah, northwestern\r\nColorado, and southwestern Wyoming (Walters, 1956). This 26-inch\r\npipeline follows the general route of U.S. Highway 163 from Cortez,\r\nColo., past Moab to Sevenmile Canyon 10 miles northwest of Moab, where\r\nit turns abruptly to the northeast and crosses about the middle of\r\nArches National Park. It crosses the park road and the flat area between\r\nthe Fiery Furnace and the southeast end of Devils Garden, but the scars\r\nare so well healed that most visitors are unaware of its existence\r\nunless they happen to look southwestward across Salt Valley, where the\r\nfilled excavation is still visible. The filled trench also appears in\r\nthe lower middle of figure 23.\r\n\r\nUnlike Canyonlands National Park a few miles to the south, Arches was\r\nnot on the route of the famous early-day river expeditions of John\r\nWesley Powell or of most of those that followed; however, the\r\nsoutheastern boundary of the park is the Colorado River, formerly the\r\nGrand, which was traversed by the first leg of the ill-fated\r\nBrown-Stanton expedition (Dellenbaugh, 1902, p. 343-369; Lohman, 1974).\r\n\r\nThe canyon of the Colorado River along the southeastern park boundary is\r\ndeep and beautiful and is a favorite stretch of quiet water for boaters\r\nand floaters. Partly paved State Highway 128 on the east bank is a part\r\nof a most scenic drive from Moab to Cisco—a small railroad town about 32\r\nmiles northeast of the eastern border of figure 1 (fig. 7). This road\r\nhas been variously called the “Moab Mail Road,” the “Cisco Cutoff,” the\r\n“Dewey Road,” or the “Dewey Bridge Road” after an old suspension bridge\r\n(fig. 7) across the Colorado River at the old townsite of Dewey about 12\r\nmiles south of Cisco. During the summer this deep colorful canyon may be\r\nviewed at night by artificial illumination. Each evening one-half hour\r\nafter sundown, an 80-passenger jet boat leaves a dock north of the\r\nhighway bridge, carries passengers several miles upstream, then floats\r\nslowly downstream followed by a truck on the highway carrying 40,000\r\nwatts of searchlights which play back and forth on the colorful red\r\ncanyon walls, while the passengers listen to a taped discourse. The\r\nentire trip requires about 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular arches and red rocks of Arches and vicinity have been\r\nused to advantage in making color movies and color TV shows. Parts of\r\nthe recent Walt Disney film “Run, Cougar, Run” were filmed beneath\r\nDelicate Arch (fig. 43), in Professor Valley of the Colorado River just\r\neast of the park (fig. 7), and in other sections of the canyon country.\r\n\r\nEver since military jet aircraft broke the sound barrier, there has been\r\na growing number of protests from concerned citizens, organizations, and\r\nNational Park Service officials concerning the dangers sonic booms have\r\nposed to Indian ruins and delicate erosional forms in our national parks\r\nand monuments, such as natural bridges, arches and windows, balanced\r\nrocks, and natural spires or towers. Many instances of damaged ruins,\r\nroads, erosional forms, and broken windows were reported. My wife and I\r\ncan vouch for the destructive power of such booms, for in October 1969,\r\nwhile we were having breakfast at Squaw Flat Campground in The Needles\r\nsection of Canyonlands National Park, a particularly severe blast from a\r\nlow-flying jet not only violently rocked our jack-supported trailer but\r\nbroke the windshield of our car.\r\n\r\nAt Arches National Park, particular fear was felt for Landscape Arch\r\n(fig. 53), thought to be the longest natural stone arch in the world,\r\nand many a special round trip from headquarters involving 47 road miles\r\nand 2 trail miles was made to check on the condition of this arch after\r\nespecially loud sonic booms were heard. Finally, in April 1972,\r\nfollowing a rash of newspaper and magazine articles that spread across\r\nthe nation, the Secretary of the Air Force put a virtual stop to this\r\ndanger by ruling that, except in an emergency (Moab Times-Independent,\r\nApril 12, 1972):\r\n\r\n  Supersonic flights must not only avoid passing over national parks,\r\n  they also may not fly near them, according to the new regulation. For\r\n  each 1,000 feet of altitude, the pilot must allow one-half mile\r\n  between the flight path and the park boundary. The regulation also\r\n  prohibits supersonic flights below 30,000 feet (over land) so the high\r\n  speed planes must allow 15 miles between the nearest park boundary and\r\n  the flight path.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that with the aid of this long-needed regulation and\r\ncooperation from visitors, the arches will remain intact for many more\r\ngenerations to see.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographic Setting\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists have divided the United States into many provinces, each of\r\nwhich has distinctive geologic and topographic characteristics that set\r\nit apart from the others. One of the most intriguing and scenic of these\r\nis the Colorado Plateaus province, referred to in this report simply as\r\nthe Colorado Plateau, or the Plateau (Hunt, C. B., 1956, fig. 1). This\r\nprovince, which covers some 150,000 square miles and is not all\r\nplateaus, as we shall see, extends from Rifle, Colo., at the northeast\r\nto a little beyond Flagstaff, Ariz., at the southwest, and from Cedar\r\nCity, Utah, at the west nearly to Albuquerque, N. Mex., at the\r\nsoutheast. Arches National Park occupies part of the Canyon Lands\r\nSection, one of the six subdivisions of the Plateau. As the names imply,\r\nthe Canyon Lands Section of the Plateau comprises a high plateau\r\ngenerally ranging in altitude from 5,000 to 7,000 feet, which has been\r\nintricately dissected by literally thousands of canyons.\r\n\r\nArches National Park is drained entirely by the Colorado River, whose\r\ndeep canyon borders the park on the southeast (fig. 1). Most of the park\r\nis drained by Salt Wash, which enters the Colorado River just southeast\r\nof The Windows section, but the southwestern part is drained by\r\nCourthouse Wash and Moab Canyon, whose flows join the Colorado just west\r\nof the bridge on which U.S. Highway 163 crosses the river.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed at a distance of 1 foot, the shaded relief map (fig. 1)\r\nshows the general shape of the land surface in and near Arches National\r\nPark to the same horizontal scale as it would appear to a person in a\r\nspacecraft flying at a height of 250,000 feet, or about 47.5 miles. This\r\nmap was prepared from part of the reverse side of a plastic-relief\r\nmap[4] at a scale of 1:250,000 by the U.S. Army Map Service of the Moab\r\nquadrangle, using a simple time- and money-saving method (Stacy, 1962).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposition of The Rock Materials\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vivid and varied colors of the bare rocks and the fantastic buttes,\r\nspires, columns, alcoves, caves, arches, and other erosional forms of\r\nArches National Park result from a fortuitous combination of geologic\r\nand climatic circumstances and events unequalled in most other parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFirst among these events was the piling up, layer upon layer, of\r\nthousands of feet of sedimentary rocks under a wide variety of\r\nenvironments. Sedimentary rocks of the region are composed of clay,\r\nsilt, sand, and gravel carried and deposited by moving water; silt and\r\nsand transported by wind; and some materials precipitated from water\r\nsolutions, such as limestone (calcium carbonate), dolomite (calcium and\r\nmagnesium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulfate with some water),\r\nanhydrite (calcium sulfate alone), common salt (sodium chloride), potash\r\nminerals, such as potassium chloride, and a few other less common types.\r\nSome of the beds were laid down in shallow seas that once covered the\r\narea or in lagoons and estuaries near the sea. Other beds were deposited\r\nby streams in inland basins or plains, a few were deposited in lakes,\r\nand the constituents of deposits like the Navajo Sandstone, were carried\r\nin by the wind. The character and thickness of the exposed sedimentary\r\nrocks and the names and ages assigned to them by geologists are shown in\r\nthe rock column (fig. 4) and in the cross section (fig. 8). The history\r\nof their deposition is summarized on pages 98-102. Figure 4 was compiled\r\nmainly from generalized sections given by A. A. Baker (1933), Dane\r\n(1935), McKnight (1940), and Wright, Shawe, and Lohman (1962), and, in\r\npart, from Hite and Lohman (1973).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROCK COLUMN OF ARCHES NATIONAL PARK.

Igneous rocks of Tertiary age (fig. 59) form the nearby La Sal\r\nMountains. The particles comprising the sedimentary rocks in the area\r\nwere derived by weathering and erosion of all three types of rocks in\r\nvarious source areas.\r\n\r\nArches National Park and nearby Canyonlands National Park are both in\r\nthe heart of the Canyon Lands Section of the Plateau; therefore, it is\r\nonly reasonable to wonder why the differences in their general character\r\nseemingly outweigh their similarities. First, let us consider the\r\nsimilarities. Both parks are underlain by dominantly red sedimentary\r\nrocks, both parks feature unusual erosional forms of sandstone, and both\r\ncontain beautiful natural arches, although the arches in Canyonlands are\r\nrestricted almost entirely to the southeastern part of The Needles\r\nsection and are in much older rocks than those in Arches.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, differences in the rocks themselves play a part in the\r\ndissimilarity of the two parks, and these differences are of two types.\r\nFirst, there are lateral changes in the character of the strata, known\r\nto geologists as facies changes, brought about by differences in the\r\nenvironment, in the type of materials, and in the mode of deposition\r\neven within relatively short distances. Thus, during parts of the\r\nPermian Period while sand, later to be known as the Cedar Mesa and White\r\nRim Sandstone Members of the Cutler Formation, was being deposited in\r\nthe southern part of Canyonlands, red mud, silt, and sand of the Cutler\r\nwere laid down farther north in Canyonlands (Lohman, 1974, fig. 9), and\r\nsimilar, though somewhat coarser, beds of the Cutler were laid down at\r\nArches (fig. 4). Further comparisons of the rock columns in the two\r\nparks show that while limestones of the Rico Formation were being\r\ndeposited in a shallow sea in the southern part of Canyonlands,\r\nadditional red mud, silt, and sand of the Cutler were being laid down\r\nabove sea level in areas to the northeast. The source of the coarser\r\nmaterials was the ancient Uncompahgre Highland, which stood above sea\r\nlevel from Late Pennsylvanian time to Late Triassic time (figs. 7, 59).\r\nAlthough wider and longer, it occupied about the same position as the\r\npresent Uncompahgre Plateau between Grand Junction and Gateway, Colo.\r\nStreams eroded the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks from this ancient\r\nlandmass and dumped the material into basins to the northeast and\r\nsouthwest. The basin to the southwest, now called the Paradox basin\r\n(after Paradox Valley, Colo.), at intervals contained shallow seas and\r\nlagoons, which I will discuss later.\r\n\r\nComparison of the rock columns for the two parks also reveals other\r\ndifferences. Both parks contain exposures of rocks as old as the\r\nPennsylvanian Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation. However, only in\r\nthe Horseshoe Canyon Detached Unit of Canyonlands are rocks as young as\r\nthe Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, whereas all the spectacular natural\r\narches that make Arches famous were formed in the Entrada Sandstone, and\r\nArches also contains several younger formations of Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous age (fig. 4).\r\n\r\nA commonly asked question is “Why are most of the rocks so red,\r\nparticularly those in which the arches were formed?” This can be\r\nanswered with one word—iron, the same pigment used in rouge and in paint\r\nfor barns and boxcars. Various oxides of iron, some including water,\r\nproduce not only brick red but also pink, salmon, brown, buff, yellow,\r\nand even green or bluish green. This does not imply that the rocks could\r\nbe considered as sources of iron ore, for the merest trace, generally\r\nonly 1 to 3 percent, is enough to produce even the darkest shades of\r\nred. The white or nearly white Navajo Sandstone and the Moab Member of\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone contain little or no iron.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by Stokes (1970, p. 3), microscopic examination of the\r\ncolored grains of quartz or other minerals shows the pigment to be\r\nmerely a thin coating on and between white or colorless particles. Sand\r\nor silt weathered from such rocks soon loses its color by the scouring\r\naction of wind or water, so that most of the sand dunes and sand bars\r\nare white or nearly so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Bending And Breaking of The Rocks\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest geologic contrast between these two closely\r\nadjacent parks lies in their different geologic structure—the kind and\r\namount of bending and breaking of the once nearly flat lying strata.\r\nConsolidated rocks, particularly brittle types, are subject to two types\r\nof fracturing by Earth forces. Joints are fractures along which no\r\nmovement has taken place. Faults are fractures along which there has\r\nbeen displacement of the two sides relative to one another (fig. 6). As\r\nnoted in the report on Canyonlands National Park (Lohman, 1974), the\r\nstrata there, particularly along the valley of the Green River, are\r\nvirtually flat lying or have only very gentle dips. Along the Colorado\r\nRiver above the confluence with the Green, however, the slightly dipping\r\nstrata are interrupted by several gentle anticlinal and synclinal folds\r\n(fig. 5) and by at least one fault (fig. 6). The largest of these\r\nfolds—the Cane Creek anticline, which crosses the Colorado River north\r\nof Canyonlands—has yielded oil in the past and is now yielding potash by\r\nsolution mining of salt beds in the Paradox Member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON TYPES OF ROCK FOLDS. Top, Anticline, or\r\n    upfold; closed anticlines are called domes. Bottom, Syncline, or\r\n    downfold; closed synclines are called basins. From Hansen (1969, p.\r\n    31, 108). (Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast to Canyonlands, Arches National Park contains three\r\nnorthwesterly trending major folds and is bordered on the southwest by a\r\nfourth. The largest and most important are the collapsed Salt Valley and\r\nCache Valley anticlines, which separate the two most scenic groups of\r\narches and other erosional forms—Eagle Park, Devils Garden, Fiery\r\nFurnace, and Delicate Arch on the northeast, and Klondike Bluffs,\r\nHerdina Park, and The Windows section on the southwest. Farther\r\nsouthwest is the Courthouse syncline, containing the attractive group of\r\nerosional forms called Courthouse Towers (fig. 1). Finally, near the\r\nsouthwest edge of the park, is the Seven Mile-Moab Valley anticline\r\n(also known as the Moab-Spanish Valley anticline), whose southwest limb\r\nis cut off by the Moab fault (figs. 7, 23). The folds just named and the\r\nsharply contrasting geologic structures of the two parks are well shown\r\non sheet 2 of the geologic map of the Moab quadrangle (Williams, 1964),\r\nand the geologic formations are shown in color on sheet 1.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON TYPES OF FAULTS.

(Fig. 9)]\r\n\r\nArches National Park and most of nearby Canyonlands National Park lie\r\nwithin what geologists have termed the “Paradox basin,” which contains a\r\nremarkable assemblage of sediments called the Paradox Member of the\r\nHermosa Formation. These deposits were laid down in shallow seas and\r\nlagoons during Middle Pennsylvanian time, roughly 300 million years ago\r\n(fig. 59). As indicated in figure 4, the Paradox Member contains, in\r\naddition to shale and limestone, minerals deposited by the evaporation\r\nand concentration of sea water—common salt, gypsum, anhydrite, and\r\npotash salts. For this reason such deposits are collectively called\r\nevaporites. Figure 7 also shows that the northeastern part of the\r\nParadox basin, which is the deepest part, contains a series of partly\r\nalined anticlines which have cores of salt and, hence, are called salt\r\nanticlines. As might be expected, roughly alined synclines intervene\r\nbetween the anticlines, but are not shown because of space limitations.\r\nAccording to Cater (1970, p. 50): “The salt anticlines of Utah and\r\nColorado are unique in North America both in structure and in mode of\r\ndevelopment.” To this may be added that they also are relatively rare in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA section across the Salt Valley anticline and the Courthouse syncline\r\nin the northwestern part of the park is shown in figure 8, and the axes\r\nof these structures are shown in figure 9.\r\n\r\nNormally, a series of roughly parallel northwestward-trending folds\r\nwould result from shortening of a segment of the Earth’s crust by\r\ncompressive forces from the northeast and the southwest, but such does\r\nnot seem to be the origin of these folds. The folds occur in a\r\nrelatively narrow belt along the northeastern part of the Paradox basin,\r\nthe deepest part, which was broken by a series of northwesterly trending\r\nnormal faults (fig. 6) that cut the deep-lying Precambrian and older\r\nPaleozoic rocks (fig. 8) prior to the deposition of the salt-bearing\r\nParadox Member of the Hermosa Formation. Movement along these faults\r\ncontinued intermittently during and after deposition of the Paradox,\r\nhowever, and resulted in the formation of a series of northwesterly\r\ntrending ridges and troughs. Following Paradox time, normal sediments\r\nderived from a rising landmass to the northeast began to fill the basin.\r\nThese sediments accumulated most rapidly and to greater thicknesses in\r\nthe fault-derived troughs. Salt differs from normal sediments in two\r\nproperties critical to the development of salt anticlines: first, salt\r\nis considerably lighter (fig. 10), and, second, salt under pressure will\r\nflow slowly by plastic deformation, much like ice in a glacier flows\r\nslowly downstream. Thus, salt in the troughs underlying the thicker and\r\nheavier masses of sediments was squeezed into the adjoining ridges,\r\ncausing them to rise. Once started, this process tended to be\r\nself-perpetuating, as the flow of salt from beneath the thick masses of\r\nsediments in the troughs made room for the accumulation of still greater\r\nthicknesses of normal sediments. Consequently, the troughs receiving\r\nmost of the sediments began to form downfolds, or synclines, and the\r\nridges receiving little or no normal sediments began to form huge salt\r\nrolls that later were to become the cores of the salt anticlines when\r\nfinally the ridges too were buried by sediments. Thus, the cross section\r\n(fig. 8) shows about 12,000 feet of the Paradox Member beneath the crest\r\nof the Salt Valley anticline and only about 2,000 feet beneath the\r\nCourthouse syncline. Near the middle of these structures farther to the\r\nsoutheast, all the Paradox Member has been squeezed out from beneath the\r\nbordering synclines.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GRAVITY ANOMALIES OVER SALT VALLEY, along line _B-B′_\r\n    shown in figure 9, and relative densities and shapes of rock bodies\r\n    beneath. Densities are in grams per cubic centimeter. Gravity values\r\n    are in milligals, as shown. The standard acceleration of gravity is\r\n    980.665 centimeters per second per second; 1 gal is equal to 1\r\n    centimeter per second per second, and 1 milligal is one thousandth\r\n    of a gal. Modified from Case and Joesting (1972, fig. 2). (Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nThe general shape of the Salt Valley anticline is shown also by\r\ncross-section _B-B′_ (fig. 10), taken along the northeast-southwest line\r\n_B-B′_ in figure 9, which is based upon so-called gravity anomalies over\r\nSalt Valley. The lighter Paradox Member, having an average density of\r\n2.20, has a lower gravitational attraction than the heavier rocks on\r\neach side, which have an average density of 2.55.\r\n\r\nBy this time you are doubtless wondering why prominent upfolds of the\r\nrocks, such as the Salt Valley anticline and associated Cache Valley\r\nanticline and the Seven Mile-Moab Valley anticline, now underlie\r\nrelatively deep valleys bordered by prominent ridges. The formation of\r\nthese valleys was not simple and involved many steps extending over a\r\nconsiderable amount of geologic time, as portrayed by Cater (1970, fig.\r\n13; 1972, fig. 4). For a part of the story, let us reexamine the cross\r\nsection (fig. 8); the rest of the story will be told in the section on\r\n“Uplift and Erosion.”\r\n\r\nFigure 8 shows that the unnamed upper member of the Hermosa Formation\r\nand the overlying Cutler and Moenkopi Formations are thickest beneath\r\nthe Courthouse syncline but wedge out against the flanks of the\r\nanticline. Although the Chinle Formation and younger rocks appear to\r\nextend across the fold, and may have extended across this part of the\r\nfold, in Colorado all rocks older than the Jurassic Morrison wedge out\r\nagainst the flanks of the salt anticlines (Cater, 1970, p. 35) and also\r\nin the widest part of the Salt Valley anticline southwest of the section\r\nin figure 8. The salt anticlines were uplifted in a series of pulses so\r\nthat some formations either were not deposited over the rising\r\nstructures or were removed by erosion before deposition of the next\r\nyounger unit. By Morrison time the supply of salt beneath the synclines\r\nseems to have become used up; hence, the anticline stopped rising, and\r\nthe Morrison and younger formations were deposited across the\r\nstructures. Thus, in figure 4, the minimum thickness of all units older\r\nthan the Morrison is given as zero. Figure 4 shows the marine Mancos\r\nShale to be the youngest rock unit exposed in the park, but the\r\nMesaverde Group of Late Cretaceous age and possibly the early Tertiary\r\n(fig. 59) Wasatch Formation may have been deposited and later removed by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Uplift And Erosion of The Plateau\r\n\r\n\r\nNext among the main events leading to the formation of landforms in the\r\npark was the raising and additional buckling and breaking of the Plateau\r\nby Earth forces partly during the Late Cretaceous but mainly during the\r\nearly Tertiary. After uplift and deformation, the Plateau was vigorously\r\nattacked by various forces of erosion, and the rock materials pried\r\nloose or dissolved were eventually carted away to the Gulf of California\r\nby the ancestral Colorado River. Some idea of the enormous volume of\r\nrock thus removed is apparent when one looks down some 2,000 feet to the\r\nriver from any of the high overlooks farther south, such as Dead Horse\r\nPoint (Lohman, 1974, fig. 15). Not so apparent, however, is the fact\r\nthat younger Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks more than 1 mile thick once\r\noverlaid this high plateau but have been swept away by erosion. In all,\r\nthe river has carried thousands of cubic miles of sediment to the sea\r\nand is still actively at work on this gigantic earth-moving project. In\r\nan earlier report (Lohman, 1965, p. 42) I estimated that the rate of\r\nremoval may have been as great as about 3 cubic miles each century. For\r\na few years the bulk of the sediment was dumped into Lake Mead, but now\r\nLake Powell is getting much of it. When these and other reservoirs\r\nultimately become filled with sediment—for reservoirs and lakes are but\r\ntemporary things—the Gulf of California will again become the burial\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cater (1970, p. 65-67), who made an intensive study of the\r\nsalt anticlines, collapse of their crests seemingly occurred in two\r\nstages—the first stage following Late Cretaceous folding; the second\r\nfollowing uplift of the Plateau later in the Tertiary. Solution and\r\nremoval of salt by ground water played the leading role in the ultimate\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TILTED BLOCK OF ROCKS IN CACHE VALLEY GRABEN, viewed\r\n    to the east toward Cache Valley from point on gravelled side road to\r\n    Wolfe’s cabin, about half a mile east of paved road. Steep slope on\r\n    left composed of Jurassic Morrison Formation, hogback on top formed\r\n    by Dakota Sandstone of Late Cretaceous age, and gentle slopes to\r\n    right composed of the Mancos Shale of Late Cretaceous age. (Fig.\r\n    11)]\r\n\r\nAs shown by Dane (1935, pl. 1, p. 121-126), collapse of the Salt Valley\r\nand Cache Valley anticlines was accompanied by considerable faulting and\r\njointing, particularly along their northeast sides; by the upward\r\nintrusion of two large areas of the Paradox Member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation, one just northwest of the park and one in the middle of Salt\r\nValley south of the campground; and by two downdropped masses of rock\r\nknown to geologists as grabens (pronounced gräbǝns)—one just northwest\r\nof the park and one called the Cache Valley graben, which extends both\r\neast and west from Salt Wash. The Cache Valley graben has preserved from\r\nerosion the youngest rock formations in the park, as shown in figure 11.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable jointing of the rocks on the northeast limb of the Salt\r\nValley anticline is shown in figure 12. All the arches in this section\r\nof the park were eroded through thin fins of the Slick Rock Member of\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone, and some, like Broken Arch, figure 16, are capped\r\nby the Moab Member.\r\n\r\nDifferences in the composition, hardness, arrangement, and thickness of\r\nthe rock layers determine their ability to withstand the forces of\r\nfracturing and erosion and, hence, whether they tend to form cliffs,\r\nledges, fins, or slopes. Most of the cliff- or ledge-forming rocks are\r\nsandstones consisting of sand deposited by wind or water and later\r\ncemented together by silica (SiO₂), calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), or one of\r\nthe iron oxides (such as Fe₂O₃), but some hard, resistant ledges are\r\nmade of limestone (calcium carbonate). The rock column (fig. 4) shows in\r\ngeneral how these rock formations are sculptured by erosion and how they\r\nprotect underlying layers from more rapid erosion. The nearly vertical\r\ncliffs along the lower reaches of Salt and Courthouse Washes and the\r\nColorado River canyon upstream from Moab consist of the well-cemented\r\nWingate Sandstone protected above by the even harder sandstones of the\r\nKayenta Formation. (See figs. 21, 22.) To borrow from an earlier report\r\nof mine (Lohman, 1965, p. 17), “Vertical cliffs and shafts of the\r\nWingate Sandstone endure only where the top of the formation is capped\r\nby beds of the next younger rock unit—the Kayenta Formation. The Kayenta\r\nis much more resistant than the Wingate, so even a few feet of the\r\nKayenta * * * protect the rock beneath.” In some places, as shown in\r\nfigures 19 and 20, the overlying Navajo Sandstone makes up the topmost\r\nunit of the cliff.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOINTED NORTHEAST FLANK OF SALT VALLEY ANTICLINE,\r\n    viewed westward from an airplane. Light-colored wedge in middle\r\n    background is Salt Valley bordered on extreme left by Klondike\r\n    Bluffs. Dark-colored fins and pinnacles on left, of Slick Rock\r\n    Member of the Entrada Sandstone, form Devils Garden. Sharp pinnacle\r\n    above valley is the Dark Angel. (See fig. 57.)

(Fig. 12)]\r\n\r\nLast but far from least among the factors responsible for the grandeur\r\nof Arches National Park and the Plateau in general is the desert\r\nclimate, which allows one to see virtually every foot of the vividly\r\ncolored naked rocks, and which has made possible the creation and\r\npreservation of such a wide variety of fantastic sculptures. A wetter\r\nclimate would have produced a far different, smoother landscape in which\r\nmost of the rocks and land forms would have been hidden by vegetation.\r\nOn the Plateau the vegetation grows mainly on the high mesas and the\r\nnarrow flood plains bordering the rivers, but scanty vegetation also\r\noccurs on the gentle slopes or flats.\r\n\r\nThe combination of layers of sediments of different composition,\r\nhardness and thickness, the bending and breaking of the rocks, and the\r\ndesert climate, has produced steep slopes having many cliffs, ledges,\r\nand fins with generally sharp to angular edges, rather than the subdued\r\nrounded forms of more humid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Origin And Development of The Arches\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the questions commonly asked by visitors are, “How do arches\r\nform?”, “Why are some openings called windows, others arches?”, “What is\r\nthe difference, if any, between arches or windows and natural bridges,\r\nsuch as those at Natural Bridges National Monument?”, and “How many\r\narches are there in Arches National Park?” Before taking up the origin\r\nand development of arches, I shall attempt to explain the differences\r\nbetween the three types of natural rock openings named above and comment\r\nupon the number of arches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INDEX MAP, showing localities where most of the\r\n    photographs were taken. Arrows point to distant views. Numbers refer\r\n    to figure numbers. (Fig. 13)]\r\n\r\nI believe most geologists and geographers are in general agreement with\r\nCleland (1910, p. 314) that “a ‘natural bridge’ is a natural stone arch\r\nthat spans a valley of erosion. A ‘natural arch’ is a similar structure\r\nwhich, however, does not span an erosion valley.” According to this\r\ndefinition, Natural Bridges National Monument includes three true\r\nbridges, whereas all the larger rock openings in Arches National Park\r\nwith which I am familiar are properly termed “arches,” but some are\r\ncalled windows. If we were to distinguish between arches and windows, we\r\nmight say that arches occur at or near the base of a rock wall, as do\r\nthe doors of a house or building, whereas windows are found well above\r\nground level. This distinction was not followed in naming the rock\r\nopenings in the park, however; for example, Tunnel Arch (fig. 14) is\r\nconsiderably higher above the ground than North Window (figs. 37, 38) or\r\nSouth Window (fig. 39).\r\n\r\nAs to the number of arches in the park, I might begin by saying that\r\nthere is no universal agreement as to how large a rock opening must be\r\nto qualify as an arch. The pamphlet formerly handed to visitors entering\r\nthe park proclaimed that “Nearly 90 arches have been discovered, and\r\nothers are probably hidden away in remote and rugged parts of the area,”\r\nbut the average visitor probably sees less than a third of this number.\r\n\r\nDavid May, Assistant Chief of Interpretation and Resource Management,\r\nMoab office of National Park Service (oral commun., Oct. 1973), believes\r\nthat if only those in the park having a minimum dimension of 10 feet in\r\nany one direction were considered to be arches, the number would boil\r\ndown to about 56 or 57. The most complete count of arches and other\r\nopenings in all of southeastern Utah was made by Dale J. Stevens,\r\nProfessor of Geography at Brigham Young University, during the period\r\nFebruary through April 1973. He considered those with openings of 3 feet\r\nor larger and found more than 300 in southeastern Utah, of which 124 are\r\nin Arches National Park, although he stated that several areas of the\r\npark were not intensively searched because of time limitations (written\r\ncommun., July and Sept. 1973). The 124 arches and openings are\r\ndistributed among the several named areas of the park, as follows:\r\nCourthouse Towers, 13; Herdina Park, 11; The Windows section, 25;\r\nDelicate Arch area, 3; Fiery Furnace, 19; Devils Garden, 25; upper\r\nDevils Garden (northwest of Devils Garden), 14; Eagle Park, 2; and\r\nKlondike Bluffs, 12.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens generally used a range finder or a steel tape to\r\nmeasure the width and height of the openings and the width and thickness\r\nof the spans, but estimated a few of the dimensions. In the text\r\ndescriptions of arches or captions of figures that follow, I am\r\nincluding all or part of these measurements, without further\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nAll the arches in the park were formed in the Entrada Sandstone, mainly\r\nin the Slick Rock Member but partly in the Slick Rock and Dewey Bridge\r\nMembers, and a few in the Slick Rock Member occur not far beneath the\r\nbase of the overlying Moab Member. The sandstone of the three members is\r\ncomposed mainly of quartz sand cemented together by calcium carbonate\r\n(CaCO₃), which also forms the mineral calcite and the rock known as\r\nlimestone, but the Dewey Bridge Member also contains beds of sandy\r\nmudstone. Limestone and calcite are soluble in acid, even in weak acid\r\nsuch as carbonic acid, HHCO₃, also written H₂CO₃, formed by the solution\r\nof carbon dioxide (CO₂) in water. Ground water, found everywhere in rock\r\nopenings at different depths beneath the land surface, contains\r\ndissolved carbon dioxide derived from decaying organic matter in soil,\r\nfrom the atmosphere, and from other sources. Even rainwater and snow\r\ncontain a little carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere—enough to\r\ndissolve small amounts of limestone or of calcite cement from sandstone.\r\nThe calcite cement in the Entrada and in many other sandstones is\r\nunevenly distributed, however, so that all the cement is removed first\r\nfrom places that contain the least amounts, and, once the cement is\r\ndissolved away, the loose sand is carried away by gravity, wind, or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBoth nearly flat but slightly irregular beds of sandstone and relatively\r\nthin walls or fins of sandstone are prime targets for this differential\r\nerosion. Potholes, as shown in figure 18_A_, may be formed in relatively\r\nflat beds by the dissolving action of repeated accumulations of\r\nrainwater or snowmelt, even in arid regions like the Plateau.\r\n\r\nRelatively thin walls, or fins as they are called in parts of the\r\nPlateau including Arches, are targets for the formation of alcoves and\r\ncaves by solution of cement and removal of sand by gravity, wind, and\r\nwater, aided by the prying action of frost in joints, bedding planes, or\r\nother openings. Once a breakthrough of a wall or fin occurs, weakened\r\nchunks from the ceiling tend to fall, and natural arches of various\r\nshapes and sizes are produced. Arches form the strongest shapes for\r\nsupporting overlying rock loads, as the rock in the arch is compressed\r\ntoward each abutment by the heavy loads. Blocks of compressed rock\r\nbeneath a relatively flat ceiling tend to be dislodged also by expansion\r\ndue to release of pent-up pressure, until a strong self-supporting arch\r\nis formed. Release of pent-up pressure in rock walls may help also in\r\ninitiating the formation of alcoves or caves in cliff faces. Man,\r\nincluding the ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and others, has long\r\nmade use of arches in building bridges, aqueducts, temples, cathedrals,\r\nand other enduring edifices.\r\n\r\nAs vividly shown in figure 12, the Entrada Sandstone on the northeast\r\nflank of the Salt Valley anticline has been broken by Earth forces into\r\nthin slabs mostly 10 to 20 feet thick between nearly parallel joints,\r\nbut, as will be noted in the descriptions of individual arches, some\r\nrock walls are only 1 or 2 feet thick, whereas others are 50 feet thick\r\nor more. Some weak or thin slabs have weathered away, leaving the\r\nstronger or thicker ones as towering fins, particularly in the Fiery\r\nFurnace and Devils Garden areas. Jointing on a less spectacular scale\r\nalso has broken the Entrada in areas south of Salt Valley, leaving walls\r\nor fins of rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TUNNEL ARCH, reached by short trail north of main\r\n    trail through Devils Garden. Opening is 26½ feet wide and 22 feet\r\n    high; span is about 14 feet thick. (Fig. 14)]\r\n\r\nAlthough all the arches in the park were carved from the Entrada\r\nSandstone, slight differences in their mode of origin or placement\r\nwithin the Entrada allow them to be grouped into three classes: (1)\r\nvertical arches formed in the Slick Rock Member alone or in the Slick\r\nRock and Moab Members, (2) vertical arches formed mainly in the Slick\r\nRock Member but partly in, and with the aid of, the incompetent\r\nunderlying Dewey Bridge Member, and (3) horizontal arches, or so-called\r\npothole arches, formed from the union of a vertical pothole and a\r\nhorizontal cave. Hereinafter, the three members will be referred to\r\nalone, without reference to the Entrada.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “BABY ARCH,” just southwest of Sheep Rock in\r\n    Courthouse Towers area. For details, see text. (Fig. 15)]\r\n\r\nBefore giving examples of arches in each of the three classes, it is\r\nappropriate to remark that the arches and other erosion forms in the\r\npark represent but a fleeting instant in geologic time. Many of the\r\npinnacles or piles of rock may be the broken remains of former arches,\r\nand many of the arches we see may be gone tomorrow, next year, or a few\r\nhundreds of years and, certainly, before many thousands of years. On the\r\nother hand, many new arches will form by the processes described above\r\nas the geologic clock ticks on.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BROKEN ARCH, reached by a ½-mile trail leading\r\n    northward across field that separates Fiery Furnace from Devils\r\n    Garden. White thin-bedded unit at top is the Moab Member, which\r\n    rests upon the massive salmon-colored Slick Rock Member. Opening is\r\n    59 feet wide and 43 feet high. (Fig. 16)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Examples of Arches\r\n\r\nTunnel Arch (fig. 14) is a good example of an arch eroded entirely\r\nwithin the massive Slick Rock Member. Just southwest of Sheep Rock (fig.\r\n31) is an unnamed opening in the lower part of the Slick Rock Member\r\nwhich I call “Baby Arch,” because it is one of the newest ones visible\r\nfrom the park road (fig. 15). It is only 25½ feet wide and 14 feet high\r\nand penetrates a wall 14 feet thick. Note that the breakthrough probably\r\nbegan along the prominent recessed bedding plane at the base of the\r\narch. Its youthfulness is also indicated by the sharp, angular breaks in\r\nthe ceiling and by the pile of freshly fallen rocks. Some visitors have\r\nasked park personnel why they have not cleared away such debris! Despite\r\nits youthfulness, the ceiling has already taken on the shape of an arch.\r\n\r\nBroken Arch (fig. 16) was formed near the top of the Slick Rock Member\r\nand is strengthened and protected by the more resistant overlying Moab\r\nMember, which forms the upper half of the span. The crest is only 6 feet\r\nthick at the thinnest point and is not broken as the name seems to\r\nimply.\r\n\r\nDouble Arch (fig. 17), “one” of the most beautiful in the park, is in\r\nThe Windows section near the east end of the road. The southeast arch,\r\nwhich is 160 feet wide and 105 feet high, is the second largest in the\r\npark, but the west arch measures only 60 feet wide and 61 feet high. In\r\ncommon with most arches in The Windows section, these two arches of the\r\nSlick Rock Member rest upon bases of the weak, easily eroded Dewey\r\nBridge Member. More rapid erosion of the Dewey Bridge undercut the\r\narches and hastened their development.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DOUBLE ARCH, in The Windows section. (Fig. 17)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PROBABLE STEPS IN FORMATION OF POTHOLE ARCH. _A_,\r\n    Original pothole probably formed in relatively level bed of\r\n    sandstone, such as this one, which is in an older rock unit—the\r\n    White Rim Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation, a unit not\r\n    present in Arches. This pothole, which contains 4 feet of water, is\r\n    in nearby Canyonlands National Park (Lohman, 1974, fig. 17), just\r\n    north of the edge of the White Rim, about 4½ miles north of the\r\n    confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers.

(Fig. 18)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18 B]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18 C]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18 D]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18 E]\r\n\r\nThe cause of the wavy bedding in the Dewey Bridge Member, as shown in\r\nfigure 17 but as better shown in the frontispiece, is not known for sure\r\nbut generally is regarded to be the result of irregular slumping during\r\nor just after deposition of the sediments in a body of water, caused by\r\nthe weight of overlying sediments.\r\n\r\nThe last example I shall take up is Pothole Arch (fig. 18), which\r\ndiffers from all the other examples in that this arch is roughly\r\nhorizontal rather than vertical. Most park visitors, including me, were\r\nnot aware of this interesting feature until after publication of the\r\npamphlet “The Guide to an Auto Tour of Arches National Park,” which, as\r\npreviously noted, may be purchased at the Visitor Center. Pothole Arch\r\ncaps a ridge high above the road half a mile northwest of Garden of\r\nEden, so only those who happened to look up at the right place were\r\naware of its existence.\r\n\r\nA different mode of origin than that given in the caption for figure 18\r\nis depicted on a poster in the Visitor Center, which shows the pothole\r\nbeing formed by a waterfall having an apparent flow rate of several\r\ncubic feet per second. Potholes can be formed in this manner in places\r\nwhere sufficient streamflow is available, either continuously or\r\nfollowing rainstorms, but I believe the process depicted in figure 18 is\r\na more likely mode of origin for Pothole Arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          How to See the Park\r\n\r\n\r\nAs aptly stated on a poster in the Visitor Center, how to see the park\r\ndepends in part upon the question “How long can you stay?” Inasmuch as\r\nthe park entrance and Visitor Center are beside a through U.S. Highway\r\n(163), many motorists first become aware of the park’s existence from\r\nthe entrance sign, and some take time for at least a quick visit, such\r\nas a round trip to The Windows section, which can be made in an hour or\r\nso.\r\n\r\nFor those who have or take more time and are able to walk at least short\r\ndistances, a visit of 1 or 2 days is a very rewarding experience.\r\nOthers, particularly avid shutterbugs and those with camping gear,\r\nprofitably spend from several days to a week or more and hike all or\r\nmost of the trails.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how long you plan to spend, I urge at least a brief stop\r\nat the Visitor Center, where excellent displays and a narrated slide\r\nshow help materially in conveying just what the park has to offer. At\r\nthe counter you can purchase a copy of “The Guide to an Auto Tour of\r\nArches National Park,” which explains the views from each of 25 numbered\r\nstops along the park road, as well as other reports describing arches or\r\nother parks and monuments.\r\n\r\nThe park is open the year round, but, like most high deserts, it gets\r\nrather hot in the summer and cold enough in the winter for occasional\r\nsnows and is sometimes closed temporarily because of heavy snowfall. The\r\nweather generally is ideal during the spring and fall. Even though\r\nsummer daytime temperatures may exceed 100°F (37.8°C) and slow down\r\nhikers, the nights are cool enough for comfortable sleeping beneath\r\nample covers.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning our trip through the park proper, let us consider a\r\nbeautiful part many people fail to realize actually belongs to the\r\npark—the Colorado River canyon forming the southeastern boundary.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Trip Through The Park\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Colorado River Canyon\r\n\r\nThe southeastern boundary of the park for about 11 miles is the Colorado\r\nRiver, from the bridge on which U.S. Highway 163 crosses the river to a\r\npoint upstream about half a mile below the mouth of Salt Wash.\r\nIlluminated night float trips down part of this reach are run during the\r\nsummer, as noted on p. 16. Partly paved State Highway 128 follows the\r\nsoutheast side of the river for about 30 miles to Dewey Bridge, then\r\ngoes northward about 15 miles to Cisco, where it connects with Highway\r\nI-70.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Glen Canyon Group form the southernmost corner of the\r\npark, as shown in figure 19. About 2 miles northeast of the bridge, we\r\ncross the axis of the Courthouse syncline (fig. 9), which brings the\r\nNavajo Sandstone down nearly to river level, as shown in figure 20. The\r\nunderlying Kayenta Formation is largely hidden by vegetation and\r\nalluvial deposits in this view.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GLEN CANYON GROUP, forming southernmost point of\r\n    park, as viewed across the Colorado River from State Highway 128\r\n    half a mile above Moab bridge carrying U.S. Highway 163.

Note that the saltcedar\r\n    (tamarisk), which lines both banks of the river, is in full bloom.\r\n    (Fig. 19)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NAVAJO SANDSTONE CLIFFS, bordering west bank of\r\n    Colorado River in Courthouse syncline, from State Highway 128 about\r\n    2 miles above the Moab bridge. Note rounded domes at top of cliff.\r\n    (Fig. 20)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUTH OF SALT WASH, viewed across Colorado River from\r\n    point on State Highway 128, 11 miles above Moab bridge. Dark cliffs\r\n    on upper right and left are of Wingate Sandstone capped by thin\r\n    protective cover of resistant sandstone beds of the Kayenta\r\n    Formation. In background Wingate is overlain by entire Kayenta\r\n    Formation and lower part of the Navajo Sandstone. Wingate is\r\n    underlain to river level by weathered slope of the Chinle Formation.\r\n    Water in Salt Wash is largely backwater from the bankfull river;\r\n    actual flow in wash generally is much less but at times reaches\r\n    flood proportions. (Fig. 21)]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 miles above the Moab bridge is the mouth of Salt Wash (fig. 1),\r\nas viewed from State Highway 128. (See fig. 21.) Seventeen miles above\r\nthe bridge (east of area shown in fig. 1), we get an excellent view of\r\nthe southeast end of the highly faulted Cache Valley anticline, as shown\r\nin figure 22. The background shown in the photograph formerly was the\r\neasternmost part of the former monument, but when the monument graduated\r\nto a park on November 16, 1971, this part of Cache Valley along with\r\nmost of Dry Mesa was withdrawn from the park and put under the\r\nsupervision of the Bureau of Land Management, also a part of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SOUTHEAST END OF FAULTED CACHE VALLEY ANTICLINE,\r\n    viewed northwestward across Colorado River from a point on State\r\n    Highway 128, 17 miles above Moab bridge.

About upper third of slope below base of cliff is the\r\n    Chinle Formation, below which is the Moenkopi Formation extending to\r\n    high-water level. Note bent and broken beds on right. (Fig. 22)]\r\n\r\nAs noted on page 16, part of “Run, Cougar, Run” was filmed just upstream\r\nfrom the irrigated field in the foreground of figure 22, in a wide part\r\nof the valley called Professor Valley (fig. 7). This valley and the\r\nRichardson Amphitheater on the southeast side of the river were named\r\nafter a Professor Richardson who settled in the area in the 1880’s. The\r\nlong abandoned townsite of Richardson was 1¼ miles due east from the\r\npoint from which figure 22 was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Headquarters Area\r\n\r\nThe junction of the park road with U.S. Highway 163 is shown at the\r\nlower left of figure 23, and the entrance station, Visitor Center,\r\nparking lot, and several buildings are seen at the lower right. Several\r\nresidences for park personnel and other buildings are shown in figure\r\n25. As shown in the lower part of figure 23, the geology at the park\r\nentrance is rather complex, as the park boundary here is partly along\r\nthe Moab fault and partly along a branch fault—both in the Seven\r\nMile-Moab Valley anticline (fig. 7). The Moab fault extends\r\nnorthwestward from Moab for more than 30 miles (McKnight, 1940, p. 120,\r\n121, pl. 1).\r\n\r\nAs shown in figure 23, soon after leaving the checking station the park\r\nroad begins to ascend the first of several switchbacks, and cuts first\r\ninto the Slick Rock Member, then the Dewey Bridge Member, and finally\r\nthe Navajo Sandstone the rest of the way to and beyond the top of the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nFrom points a mile or so up the hill may be seen interesting features in\r\nseveral directions.[5] The view to the southwest is shown in figure 23,\r\nto the west are the Three Penguins (fig. 24). A good view of the Moab\r\nValley is had by looking southeastward (fig. 25). A well in the Navajo\r\nSandstone at the base of the hill supplies water to all the residences\r\nand to the Visitor Center, where a drinking fountain and modern\r\nrestrooms are available to the public. Storage is provided by a steel\r\ntank hidden in a ravine above the buildings shown in figure 25.\r\n\r\nTo the north the wall of Entrada Sandstone is cut by a normal fault\r\n(fig. 6), as shown in figure 26.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FAULTED SEVEN MILE-MOAB VALLEY ANTICLINE. Top, View\r\n    toward the southwest from park road about 1 mile above entrance\r\n    station. Bottom, Geologic interpretation of photograph in part after\r\n    McKnight (1940, pl. 1).

The original sequence of the rocks may be visualized by\r\n    placing the Navajo Sandstone, the upper part of which is exposed at\r\n    the lower right, on top of the Kayenta Formation, the lower few feet\r\n    of which cap and protect the cliffs of Wingate Sandstone in the\r\n    background. The Pacific Northwest (gas) Pipeline mentioned on page\r\n    15 is buried beneath the slice of the Moenkopi Formation between the\r\n    two faults, which accounts for the disturbed appearance of the rock.\r\n    (Fig. 23)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Geologic interpretation of photograph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THREE PENGUINS, viewed westward from park road about\r\n    1 mile above entrance station.

(Fig.\r\n    27)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Courthouse Towers Area\r\n\r\nAbout 2.3 miles from the entrance station is a turnoff and parking area\r\nat the south end of the Park Avenue trail (stop 2), which is about 1\r\nmile long and ends at another parking area 1.7 miles farther north. An\r\ninteresting hike is best made from south to north in a downhill\r\ndirection, and hikers generally meet the cars of relatives or friends\r\nawaiting them at the northern parking area. The trail begins in a canyon\r\ncut in the soft Dewey Bridge Member and walled by high fins of the Slick\r\nRock Member (fig. 27), but farther north the canyon is floored by the\r\nbare Navajo Sandstone. The avenue was named from the resemblance of the\r\neast wall to a row of tall buildings. Atop the west wall, just to the\r\nleft of the view in figure 27, are two balanced rocks (fig. 28). The one\r\non the left, which resembles somewhat the head of an Egyptian queen, is\r\noffset to the right along a bedding plane, and this offset may have been\r\ncaused by an earthquake.\r\n\r\nAs we progress toward Courthouse Towers proper, lofty fins and monoliths\r\nlie mostly on our left, and to the right are fine distant views of the\r\nLa Sal Mountains (stop 4). A general view of the Courthouse Towers is\r\nshown in figure 29, and closeups of two of the named rock sculptures—the\r\nThree Gossips and Sheep Rock—are shown in figures 30 and 31. Just beyond\r\nSheep Rock, which some think resembles the Sphinx, we see “Baby Arch,”\r\nshown in figure 15.\r\n\r\nFive miles from the entrance station, the road crosses Courthouse Wash\r\non a modern bridge (stop 6)—a distinct improvement over the two tracks\r\nin the sand we used in 1946. The Courthouse syncline, named after the\r\nwash, extends northwestward through here. (See figs. 8, 9, 20.) About a\r\nmile west of the bridge, Professor Stevens found another pothole arch. A\r\nmile and a half north of the bridge is stop 7, where attention is called\r\nin the booklet to the vast area of “petrified dunes” east of the road,\r\nwhich are simply dunelike exposures of the crossbedded Navajo Sandstone\r\nformed originally by the cementation of a vast area of sand dunes. My\r\nview of these was taken about 1 mile beyond the stop (fig. 32).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BALANCED ROCKS ON SOUTH WALL OF PARK AVENUE, at south\r\n    end of trail. (Fig. 28)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COURTHOUSE TOWERS, viewed to the northwest from point\r\n    on park road about three-fourths of a mile northeast of the south\r\n    end of Park Avenue trail. Sandstone towers are Slick Rock Member\r\n    resting on Dewey Bridge Member, which also forms foreground. Three\r\n    Gossips at upper left, Sheep Rock just beyond.

(Fig. 31)]\r\n\r\nWest of the road between the petrified dunes and The Windows section,\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone, particularly the Dewey Bridge Member, has been\r\nweathered into grotesque spires and pinnacles resembling the so-called\r\n“hoodoos and goblins” in Goblin Valley State Park, just north of\r\nHanksville, Utah. Typical examples of “hoodoos and goblins” are shown in\r\nfigure 33 (near stop 8). It seems reasonable to assume that some of\r\nthese spires are the skeletal remains of former arch abutments. From\r\nhere may be seen North and South Windows and Turret Arch on the skyline\r\nto the northeast (figs. 37-40).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PETRIFIED SAND DUNES, looking northeast from park\r\n    road 2.7 miles north of Courthouse Wash. The Navajo Sandstone was\r\n    once a huge sandpile of dunes laid down by winds during an arid\r\n    interval, so it is interesting to note that the irregularly\r\n    weathered sandstone once again resembles a pile of crossbedded\r\n    dunes. See also figure 35. (Fig. 32)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “HOODOOS AND GOBLINS,” weathered from Dewey Bridge\r\n    Member, viewed northwest from park road about 2½ miles north of\r\n    Courthouse Wash. (Fig. 33)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Windows Section\r\n\r\nThe Windows section, one of the most beautiful parts of the park, once\r\nwas the only readily accessible part of the former monument and is still\r\nthe only collection of arches seen by many visitors who either do not\r\nhave or do not take time to travel farther north. All the arches and\r\nerosion forms are on or near a high crest called Elephant Butte (Dane,\r\n1935, p. 126, 127), which separates Salt Valley from the Courthouse\r\nsyncline. The ridge also marks the south edge of several minor\r\nanticlines and synclines termed by Dane the “Elephant Butte folds.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EYE OF THE WHALE, one of several arches in Herdina\r\n    Park, just south of jeep trail about 2 miles northwest of Balanced\r\n    Rock. Cut in Slick Rock Member. Front opening is 60 feet wide and 27\r\n    feet high, but back opening is only 35 feet wide and 11 feet high.\r\n    Photograph by Professor Dale J. Stevens, Brigham Young University.\r\n    (Fig. 34)]\r\n\r\nGuarding the approach to The Windows section is Balanced Rock (stop 9).\r\nAs shown in the frontispiece, it is accompanied on the right by another\r\nbalanced rock and a third one may be seen in the distance. The original\r\nroute to The Windows section, pioneered by Goulding, passed just north\r\nof Balanced Rock. Traces of the old road between here and the Garden of\r\nEden parking area are still visible but no longer used. To the west,\r\nhowever, a part of the old road is the starting point of a jeep trail\r\nleading northwestward through Herdina Park to a point near Klondike\r\nBluffs, where it joins the dirt road in Salt Valley (fig. 1). Visitors\r\nhaving four-wheel-drive vehicles may wish to drive at least as far as\r\nEye of The Whale (fig. 34), which is about 2 miles northwest of Balanced\r\nRock. There are several picnic tables at the beginning of this jeep\r\ntrail, but no water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INTRICATE CROSSBEDS IN NAVAJO SANDSTONE, on north\r\n    side of road between Garden of Eden and Cove of Caves. Red crest is\r\n    basal part of Dewey Bridge Member. (Fig. 35)]\r\n\r\nJust beyond Balanced Rock, a branch paved road turns eastward 2½ miles\r\nto the main parking lots in The Windows section. Between the Garden of\r\nEden (stop 13) and Cove of Caves are spectacular exposures of the Navajo\r\nSandstone showing the crossbedding typical of the original dunes (fig.\r\n35). Just east of the crossbedded Navajo Sandstone, shown in figure 35,\r\nwe pass Cove Arch and Cove of Caves (stop 10) on the north side of the\r\nroad (fig. 36).\r\n\r\nJust around the curve east of Cove of Caves is the first of two parking\r\nlots (stop 11) forming a one-way loop at the end of this branch of the\r\nroad. From the loop may be seen the greatest concentration of readily\r\naccessible arches in the park, all of which are roofed by the Slick Rock\r\nMember and floored by the Dewey Bridge Member. Let us take the short\r\npaved trail from the upper lot to the southeast, where we come first to\r\nNorth Window (fig. 37). If we walk through this arch and climb the rock\r\nbeyond (fig. 37 caption), we see one of the best views in the park (fig.\r\n38). A short walk south of North Window brings us to South Window (fig.\r\n39). The other side of this arch may be reached either by walking around\r\nthe nearby southeast end of the fin or by walking through North Window.\r\nA short walk to the southwest brings us to Turret Arch—the one seen\r\nthrough North Window in figure 38. Figure 40 was taken from the\r\nsouthwest side of Turret Arch, viewed northeastward toward South Window,\r\none corner of which appears at the left. Both North and South Windows\r\nmay be seen in one photograph taken from points near Turret Arch.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COVE ARCH AND COVE OF CAVES, on north side of road\r\n    just west of Double Arch and Parade of Elephants. Arch at left and\r\n    three of the caves on right are roofed by Slick Rock Member and\r\n    floored by Dewey Bridge Member. Arch is 48½ feet wide and 34 feet\r\n    high. In time the caves will eat through the 30-foot-thick fin and\r\n    become arches. Note sharp contact between Dewey Bridge Member and\r\n    Navajo Sandstone. (Fig. 36)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NORTH WINDOW, viewed to the northeast. Large rock\r\n    seemingly partly blocking left end of arch actually is the southeast\r\n    end of a fin some 50 feet or more beyond the arch, from which figure\r\n    38 was taken. Arch is 93 feet wide and 51 feet high. (Fig. 37)]\r\n\r\nFrom the lower parking lot (stop 12), a short walk by paved trail takes\r\nus to spectacular Double Arch, shown in figure 17. This arch is visible\r\nfrom the parking lot but is best seen and photographed from at or near\r\nthe end of the trail. Looking westward from near the trail’s end, we see\r\nthe Parade of Elephants, shown in figure 41. This feature is described\r\non pages 16 and 17 of “The Guide to an Auto Tour of Arches National\r\nPark” as “whimsical stone statuary resembling a circus pachyderm parade.\r\nWith tail in trunk, the elephants rumble toward you along a sandstone\r\nroadway.”\r\n\r\nRibbon Arch, on the north side of Elephant Butte, is one of the most\r\ndelicate ones in the park (fig. 1). Although it is 50 feet wide and 55\r\nfeet high, the rock span is only 1½ feet wide and 1 foot thick.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the intersection with the main park road, we pass\r\nstop 14, from which may be seen Pothole Arch (fig. 18). One and one-half\r\nmiles north of the intersection with the main road is the Panorama Point\r\nparking area (stop 15), which affords fine distant views of Salt and\r\nCache Valleys and points beyond. A roadside exhibit portrays the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the Salt Valley anticline, which supplements my\r\ndescription on pages 27-32. A parking space a short distance farther\r\ndown the hill (stop 16) provides good distant views of the Fiery\r\nFurnace. I tried several telephoto shots from this viewpoint, but\r\npreferred my closeup views, such as the one shown in figure 44.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH NORTH WINDOW, from fin\r\n    shown beyond left side of North Window in figure 37. Turret Arch\r\n    (fig. 40) is seen at right middle ground, south rim of Moab Valley\r\n    to left of arch, Colorado River canyon forms left skyline. (Fig.\r\n    38)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SOUTH WINDOW, viewed toward northeast. Arch is 105\r\n    feet wide and 66 feet high. See text. (Fig. 39)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Delicate Arch Area\r\n\r\nTwo and a half miles northeast of the road intersection near Balanced\r\nRock, a gravelled side road leads northeastward to several points of\r\nconsiderable interest. The photograph in figure 11 was taken from this\r\nside road about half a mile northeast of the intersection. About 2 miles\r\nto the northeast, just beyond Salt Valley Wash, is a parking area (stop\r\n17) at the beginning of the trail past Wolfe’s Bar-DX Ranch (fig. 3) to\r\nfamed Delicate Arch, which is featured on the front cover. Although the\r\ntrail to the arch is only 1½ miles long, it crosses several hills at the\r\noutset, then climbs 500 feet, mostly on bare Entrada Sandstone, so is\r\nconsidered quite strenuous, particularly in hot weather. The Park\r\nService advises hikers to carry water. The Walt Disney crew, cameras,\r\ngear, cougars, and all climbed this trail in the hottest part of the\r\nsummer of 1971 (see p. 16), while my wife and I were working in the\r\nvicinity. Visitors who do not wish to make the hike may get a distant\r\nview of Delicate Arch by driving to a parking area (stop 18) 1.3 miles\r\nfarther east.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TURRET ARCH, viewed northeast toward South Window,\r\n    part of which is visible on left. Small opening on right is visible\r\n    also in figure 38. Largest arch is 39 feet wide and 64 feet high;\r\n    smaller one is 12 feet wide and 13 feet high. A still smaller one,\r\n    not visible in the photograph, is 8 feet wide and only 4½ feet high.\r\n    (Fig. 40)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PARADE OF ELEPHANTS, viewed west from end of trail to\r\n    Double Arch. Two elephants are on right, one on left. (Fig. 41)]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Wolfe’s Ranch, the trail to Delicate Arch crosses Salt\r\nWash on a suspension foot bridge (fig. 42). Just beyond the bridge, a\r\nshort walk to the left (north) leads to the Ute petroglyphs shown in the\r\nlower photograph of figure 2. The most difficult part of the trail, on\r\nbare sandstone, is marked by cairns of stones placed at sufficient\r\nintervals to keep hikers from losing the barely visible trail. When the\r\nsummit finally is reached and the last corner rounded, one suddenly sees\r\nperhaps the most sublime view in the park—famed Delicate Arch, framing\r\npart of the La Sal Mountains beyond (fig. 43). This graceful arch and\r\nmighty Landscape Arch (fig. 53) were considered to be in serious\r\njeopardy during the era of sonic booms, but hopefully this danger now is\r\npast. (See p. 16-17.)\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to shutterbugs that professional photographer Hal\r\nRumel lugged an 8- × 10-inch camera plus a heavy tripod and accessories\r\nup the steep trail to get the excellent photograph of Delicate Arch\r\nshown in figure 43. The late afternoon sun intensified the red somewhat,\r\nbut my shots made earlier in the day using both 4- × 5-inch and 35-mm\r\nequipment resulted in unwanted shadows, even though the salmon color of\r\nthe Slick Rock Member was more nearly normal.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the junction with the side road, the main park road\r\ntraverses slices of vertical strata squeezed between faults along the\r\nnorth side of Salt Valley, then gradually climbs out of the valley for\r\nabout 2 miles to a parking area (stop 19), from which good views are had\r\nof the southeast end of Salt Valley and of the grabens in the west end\r\nof Cache Valley. (See fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SUSPENSION FOOT BRIDGE ACROSS SALT WASH, in front of\r\n    Wolfe’s cabin at beginning of Delicate Arch trail.

The\r\n    left abutment is only 5 feet wide at the narrowest point. The arch\r\n    is carved near the top of the Slick Rock Member, and the top of the\r\n    span, 19 feet thick, is capped by a few feet of the more resistant\r\n    Moab Member, as is Broken Arch (fig. 16). Photograph by Hal Rumel,\r\n    Salt Lake City. (Fig. 43)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Fiery Furnace\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile farther uphill is a parking area for viewing the\r\nsoutheastern part of the Fiery Furnace (stop 20), a vast array of\r\ntowering fins and pinnacles of the reddish Slick Rock Member separated\r\nby narrow slots, vaguely resembling flames shooting skyward. The view of\r\nthe Fiery Furnace in figure 44 was taken about 1 mile farther up the\r\nhill. It is not difficult to get lost among this myriad of fins and\r\nnarrow slots, so ranger-guided tours are conducted during the summer.\r\n\r\nAbout 1 mile farther northwest is a parking area (stop 23) from which a\r\nshort walk to the north end of Fiery Furnace leads to a narrow slot\r\nbetween high fins (fig. 45), along which a short sandy trail leads to a\r\nrecess along the southwest wall containing Sand Dune Arch (fig. 46).\r\nThis hidden arch receives sunshine only near the middle of the day and\r\nis a delightful, shady place to rest.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance to the slot leading to Sand Dune Arch, a trail goes\r\nhalf a mile north across an open field to Broken Arch, shown in figure\r\n16. This field, which separates the Fiery Furnace and Devils Garden\r\nareas, is seen from the air in figure 12.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph figure]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIERY FURNACE, viewed northwest along park road about\r\n    1 mile northwest from stop 20. Fins and spires are of the jointed\r\n    Slick Rock Member (fig. 12), but the top of the Dewey Bridge Member\r\n    is seen to the right of the curve in the road. (Fig. 44)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TRAIL TO SAND DUNE ARCH, looking northwest away from\r\n    arch, between towering fins of Slick Rock Member, at northwest end\r\n    of Fiery Furnace.

(Fig. 46)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Salt Valley and Klondike Bluffs\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the end of the paved road, let us take an\r\nunimproved side road, which turns south about a third of a mile beyond\r\nthe last stop, in order to see more of Salt Valley and to visit Klondike\r\nBluffs in the northwestern part of the park. After descending 2.3 miles\r\nof winding road we reach the normally dry bed of Salt Valley Wash, and\r\nturn abruptly to the northwest. For the next three-fourths of a mile the\r\n“road” is simply two tracks in the loose, sandy bed of the wash, which\r\nobviously should not be travelled when flooded or when there is even a\r\nhint of rain. In dry weather, however, this road may be travelled by\r\nordinary passenger car. This stretch of the wash cuts through an\r\nintruded block of the Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation consisting\r\nmainly of gray and brown gypsum, the common salt having been dissolved\r\nout by ground water. Such an intrusive block of salt-bearing rock is\r\nknown to geologists as a diapir—not to be confused with the garment\r\n(diaper) worn by infants.\r\n\r\nFrom here on the road traverses a rather uninteresting stretch of valley\r\nnorth of Salt Valley Wash. Eleven miles from the starting point, the\r\nroad reaches an intersection from which a side road leads southwestward\r\nthree-fourths of a mile to a parking area at the foot of Klondike\r\nBluffs, which form the south side of Salt Valley. From here, one may\r\nmake a strenuous hike over a primitive trail about 1½ miles long to\r\nbeautiful Tower Arch (fig. 47).\r\n\r\nThe valley road continues northwestward from the intersection to and\r\nbeyond the northwest end of the park and connects with roads to Crescent\r\nJunction, Thompson, and the Yellow Cat mining district, north of the\r\npark (p. 14).\r\n\r\nLet us return to the paved road and continue our tour of the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Devils Garden\r\n\r\nTurning left (northwest) at the intersection with the paved park road,\r\nwe enter Devils Garden—another large maze of towering red fins separated\r\nby narrow slots, which resembles the Fiery Furnace. After a third of a\r\nmile, we reach stop 24 and walk 100 feet or more to the north for a good\r\nview of Skyline Arch (fig. 48). This arch is very appropriately named,\r\nas it forms the skyline viewed either from the road on the south or from\r\nthe campground on the north, from points south of the amphitheater. Less\r\nwell known is the fact that Skyline Arch is clearly visible to the naked\r\neye or through binoculars from stretches of Highway I-70 (or old U.S.\r\nHighways 6 and 50) about 11 miles to the north. Most arches and other\r\nerosion forms do not change appearance much from day to day or year to\r\nyear, but some, like “Baby Arch” (fig. 15), show evidence of relatively\r\nrecent origin. In November 1940 (Abbey, 1971, p. 42) Skyline Arch\r\nsuddenly doubled in size by the fall of a large rock that occupied what\r\nis now the northwest half of the arch. Photographs taken before and\r\nafter this event appear on pages 24 and 25 of the road guide and also in\r\nthe museum at the Visitor Center.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TOWER ARCH, on Klondike Bluffs, viewed eastward. Arch\r\n    is in Slick Rock Member but tower on left, after which arch was\r\n    named, is capped by a protective layer of the resistant Moab Member.\r\n    Opening is 88 feet wide and 43 feet high. Photograph by Robert D.\r\n    Miller. (Fig. 47)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKYLINE ARCH, viewed north from point about 100 feet\r\n    north of stop 24, in Slick Rock Member. Although fins are vertical,\r\n    note that the strata seem to dip about 15° to the right, although\r\n    the actual dip is to the northeast. (See fig. 50.) (Fig. 48)]\r\n\r\nAnother half mile brings us to a one-way (to right) loop at the end of\r\nthe park road. Just beyond the beginning of the loop is a parking lot\r\nand very attractive picnic area containing several picnic tables shaded\r\nby piñon pines at the foot of a towering red fin of the Slick Rock\r\nMember. Just north of this picnic ground, a paved side road leads\r\neastward into a truly beautiful, well-equipped campground comprising\r\nboth back-in and drive-through campsites for trailers, campers, or\r\ntents; three pairs of modern restrooms, hydrants, and drinking\r\nfountains; and an amphitheater, where illustrated campfire talks are\r\ngiven nightly during the summer. The east end of the campground is shown\r\nin figure 49.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAMPGROUND IN DEVILS GARDEN, viewed northwestward\r\n    across turn-around at southeastern end. (Fig. 49)]\r\n\r\nDevils Garden in general and the campground in particular are on the\r\ncrest of a ridge separating Salt Valley to the southwest from the Sagers\r\nWash syncline to the northeast, which lies north of Yellow Cat Flat and\r\nnorth of the area shown in figure 1. From the higher parts of the\r\ncampground striking views are to be had toward the north and northeast,\r\nparticularly late in the afternoon, as shown in figure 50.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VIEW NORTH FROM CAMPGROUND, in late afternoon.\r\n    Reddish Slick Rock Member capped by light-colored Moab Member are\r\n    seen dipping northeastward toward Sagers Wash syncline. Book Cliffs,\r\n    north of Thompson, are 16 miles north on left skyline. (Fig. 50)]\r\n\r\nIn about the middle of the one-way loop at the end of the park road is a\r\nwell that supplies water to the campground from early in the spring\r\nuntil the return of freezing weather late in the fall. The well, which\r\nwas drilled in 1962 to a depth of 900 feet, obtains a small amount of\r\nwater from the Wingate Sandstone. No water was found in the overlying\r\nNavajo and Entrada Sandstones because of the pronounced dip of the rocks\r\ntoward the northeast, which allows any water in these rocks to drain\r\nnortheastward (Ted Arnow, written commun., 1963). Water from this well\r\nis pumped to a steel tank in a high part of the campground, whence it\r\nflows by gravity to the three sets of restrooms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SOUTHEASTERN PART OF DEVILS GARDEN TRAIL, viewed\r\n    northwestward. Narrow slot between fins of Slick Rock Member\r\n    indicates local spacing of joints. (Fig. 51)]\r\n\r\nAt the northwest end of the one-way loop is a large parking area for use\r\nby people hiking the Devils Garden trail. This trail leads to seven of\r\nthe most interesting arches in the park, all of which are in the Slick\r\nRock Member, and there are many more farther to the northwest. The\r\napproximate distances to the seven arches are given in the paragraphs\r\nthat follow. The trail is paved for about 1 mile as far as Landscape\r\nArch (fig. 53), but from there to Double O Arch (fig. 56) the trail is\r\nprimitive, and the Park Service recommends rubber soles as part of the\r\ntrail is on bare sandstone. For these reasons, many visitors hike only\r\nas far as Landscape Arch.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PINE TREE ARCH, viewed northeastward. Opening is 46\r\n    feet wide and 48 feet high. Fin is 30 feet thick. (Fig. 52)]\r\n\r\nMuch of the trail, particularly the first part, lies in a narrow slot\r\nbetween fins of the Slick Rock Member, as shown in figure 51. After\r\nabout half a mile, a side trail to the north leads to a Y, the\r\nright-hand fork of which goes to Tunnel Arch (fig. 14). The left-hand\r\nfork leads to Pine Tree Arch, obviously named for the piñon pine framed\r\nby this arch (fig. 52).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the improved part of the trail, we reach Landscape Arch\r\n(fig. 53), claimed by the Park Service to be the longest known natural\r\narch in the world. According to Ouellette (1958) it is 291 feet long and\r\n118 feet high, but Professor Stevens’ measurements indicate it to be 287\r\nfeet long and 106 feet high. At its thinnest point on the right, the\r\nspan is only 11 feet wide and 11 feet thick. In 1958 three young men\r\nmade what was claimed to be the second known ascent of Landscape Arch,\r\nusing ropes and other climbing gear, after which they walked across\r\n(Ouellette, 1958). This crossing was made with the permission of a park\r\nranger, but such permission is no longer given, for the safety of both\r\nthe arch and of would-be climbers.\r\n\r\nWall Arch is about a quarter of a mile beyond the end of the improved\r\npart of the trail, and another three-fourths mile brings us to Navajo\r\nArch (fig. 54) and Partition Arch (fig. 55). A distant view of Partition\r\nArch may be had just before reaching Landscape Arch. Part of the\r\nremaining trail to Double O Arch (fig. 56) is on the top of a low\r\nsandstone fin, in part between somewhat higher fins and in part above\r\nlower slots.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LANDSCAPE ARCH, viewed southwestward from near end of\r\n    improved part of Devils Garden trail. Note that ground beneath arch\r\n    is covered by slope wash and near the middle with what appears to be\r\n    a small landslide. Slick Rock Member here is more nearly buff than\r\n    salmon colored, because of a smaller content of iron oxide. Fresh\r\n    breaks and angular blocks of stone at right abutment indicate\r\n    relatively recent rock falls. See text for size.

(Fig. 59)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GEOLOGIC TIME\r\n                          The Age of the Earth\r\n\r\n    The Earth is very old—4.5 billion years or more according to recent\r\n    estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in\r\n    the rocks that form the Earth’s crust. The rock layers\r\n    themselves—like pages in a long and complicated history—record the\r\n    surface-shaping events of the past, and buried within them are\r\n    traces of life—the plants and animals that evolved from organic\r\n    structures that existed perhaps 3 billion years ago.\r\n\r\n    Also contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements whose\r\n    isotopes provide Earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within these\r\n    rocks, “parent” isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form\r\n    “daughter” isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent\r\n    and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.\r\n\r\n    Thus, the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of\r\n    fossils (paleontology), coupled with the ages of certain rocks as\r\n    measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest to a very old\r\n    Earth!\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens found 14 arches in what he called upper Devils Garden,\r\nnorthwest of Double O Arch, and two arches in the northwesternmost\r\nextension of the park known as Eagle Park (fig. 1). One of the unnamed\r\narches in upper Devils Garden is shown in figure 58. I am tentatively\r\ncalling it “Indian-Head Arch,” because of the rather obvious\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nThis ends our journey through Arches National Park, but there remains\r\nfor consideration a summary of the principal geologic events leading to\r\nthe formation of this beautiful part of the Colorado Plateau and a brief\r\ncomparison with the geology of other national parks and monuments on the\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Summary of Geologic History\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving finished our geologic trip through Arches National Park, let us\r\nsee how the arches and other features fit into the bigger scheme of\r\nthings—the geologic age and events of the Earth as a whole, as depicted\r\nin figure 59. As shown in figure 4, the rock strata still preserved in\r\nthe park range in age from Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous, or from about\r\n300 million to 100 million years old—a span of about 200 million years.\r\nThis seems an incredibly long time, until one notes that the earth is\r\nsome 4.5 billion years old, and that our rock pile is but 1/23 or 4½\r\npercent of the age of the Earth as a whole. Thus, in figure 59, the\r\nrocks exposed in the park occupy only about the left half of the top\r\nwhorl of the spiral.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole story. As indicated earlier, younger Mesozoic\r\nand Tertiary rocks more than 1 mile thick that once covered the area\r\nhave been carried away by erosion, and if we include these the span is\r\nincreased to about 250 million years, or nearly a full whorl of the\r\nspiral.\r\n\r\nDeep tests for oil and gas tell us that much older rocks underlie the\r\narea, and we have seen that some of these played a part in shaping the\r\npark we see today. In addition to the Precambrian igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks, there is about 2,000 feet of Paleozoic sedimentary\r\nrocks older than the Pennsylvanian Paradox Member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation, most of which was laid down in ancient seas. This includes\r\nstrata of Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian, Mississippian, and\r\nPennsylvanian ages (fig. 59). There are some gaps in the rock record\r\ncaused by temporary emergence of the land above sea level and erosion of\r\nthe land surface before the land again subsided below sea level so that\r\ndeposition could resume. Silurian rocks are absent, presumably because,\r\nhere, the Silurian Period was dominated by erosion rather than\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nWhile Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks were being laid down in and\r\nsouthwest of the park, a large area to the northeast, called by\r\ngeologists the Uncompahgre Highland (because it occupied the same\r\ngeneral area as part of the present Uncompahgre Plateau), rose slowly\r\nabove sea level. Whatever Paleozoic rocks were on this rising land plus\r\npart of the underlying Precambrian rocks were eroded and carried by\r\nstreams into deep basins to the northeast and southwest. Thus, while\r\nsome marine or near-shore deposits were being laid down in and south of\r\nthe park, thousands of feet of red beds were being laid down by streams\r\nbetween the park and what is now the Uncompahgre Plateau. During part of\r\nMiddle Pennsylvanian time, a large area, including the park, known as\r\nthe Paradox basin, was alternately connected to or cut off from the sea,\r\nso that the water was evaporated during cutoff periods and replenished\r\nduring periods when connection with the sea resumed. In these huge\r\nevaporation basins were deposited the salt and gypsum plus some potash\r\nsalts and shale that now make up the Paradox Member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nArches National Park contains four northwesterly trending major\r\nfolds—the Salt Valley and Cache Valley salt anticlines, the Courthouse\r\nsyncline, and the faulted Moab-Seven Mile anticline, which forms the\r\nsouthwestern border. How these folds were formed was explained on pages\r\n27-32. The history of their growth, however, was a long one that began\r\nabout 300 million years ago in the Pennsylvanian and ended about 50\r\nmillion years ago in the early Tertiary. The growth of these folds\r\noccurred in two stages. The first stage, which involved the development\r\nof the salt cores of the anticlines, ended in the Jurassic with the\r\nbeginning of Morrison time; the second stage, which involved additional\r\nfolding that intensified the magnitude and shape of existing folds,\r\noccurred in the early Tertiary and was followed later by collapse of the\r\nsalt anticlines. The formation and collapse of the Salt Valley and Cache\r\nValley anticlines was accompanied by pronounced jointing (fig. 12),\r\nwhich allowed differential erosion to produce the tall fins in which the\r\narches were formed.\r\n\r\nThe old Uncompahgre Highland continued to shed debris into the bordering\r\nbasins until Triassic time, when it began to be covered by a veneer of\r\nred sandstone and siltstone of the Chinle Formation (Lohman, 1965). The\r\narea remained above sea level during the Triassic Period and most, if\r\nnot all, of the Jurassic Period, although the Jurassic Carmel Formation\r\nwas laid down in a sea that lay just to the west.\r\n\r\nLate in the Cretaceous Period a large part of Central and Southeastern\r\nUnited States, including the eastern half of Utah, sank beneath the sea\r\nand received thousands of feet of mud, silt, and some sand that later\r\ncompacted into the Mancos Shale. This formation, as well as all younger\r\nand some older strata, has long since been eroded from most of the park\r\narea, but a little of the Mancos is preserved in the Cache Valley graben\r\n(fig. 11), and the entire Mancos Shale and younger rocks are present in\r\nadjacent areas, such as the Book Cliffs north of Green River, Crescent\r\nJunction, and Cisco (figs. 7, 50, 56).\r\n\r\nThe land rose above the sea at about the close of the Cretaceous and has\r\nremained above ever since, although inland basins and lakes received\r\nsediment during parts of the Tertiary Period. Compressive forces in the\r\nEarth’s crust produced some gentle folding of the strata at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous, but more pronounced folding and some faulting occurred\r\nduring the Eocene Epoch, when most of the Rocky Mountains took form.\r\nDuring the Miocene Epoch igneous rock welled up into older rocks to form\r\nthe cores of the nearby La Sal, Abajo, and Henry Mountains. Additional\r\nuplift and some folding occurred in the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs.\r\n\r\nMuch of the course of the Colorado River was established during the\r\nMiocene Epoch, with some additional adjustments in the late Pliocene and\r\nearly Pleistocene Epochs (Hunt, C. B., 1969, p. 67). Erosion during much\r\nof the Tertiary Period and all of the Quaternary Period plus some\r\nsagging and breaking of the crest of the anticlines, brought on by\r\nsolution and lateral squeezing of salt beds beneath the Moab-Seven Mile,\r\nSalt Valley, and Cache Valley anticlines, combined to produce the\r\nlandscape as we now see it.\r\n\r\nThe Precambrian rocks beneath the area are about 1.5 billion years old;\r\nso an enormous span of time is represented by the rocks and events in\r\nand beneath Canyonlands National Park.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the geologic formations that make up the national parks\r\n(N.P.), national monuments (N.M.) (excluding small historical or\r\narchaeological ones), Monument Valley, San Rafael Swell, and Glen Canyon\r\nNational Recreation Area, all in the Colorado Plateau, it becomes\r\napparent that certain formations or groups of formations play starring\r\nroles in some parks or monuments, some play supporting roles, and in a\r\nfew places the entire cast of rocks gets about equal billing. Let us\r\ncompare them and see how and where they fit into the “Geologic Time\r\nSpiral” (fig. 59).\r\n\r\nDinosaur N.M., with exposed rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to\r\nCretaceous, covers the greatest time span (nearly 2 billion years), but\r\nhas one unit—the Jurassic Morrison Formation—in the starring role, for\r\nthis unit contains the many dinosaur fossils that give the monument its\r\nname and fame, although there are several older units in supporting\r\nroles. Grand Canyon N.P. and N.M. are next, with rocks ranging in age\r\nfrom Precambrian through Permian (excluding the Quaternary lava flows in\r\nthe N.M.), but here there is truly a team effort, for the entire cast\r\ngets about equal billing. Canyonlands N.P. stands third in this\r\ncategory, with rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, but we\r\nwould have to give top billing to the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone\r\nMember of the Cutler Formation, from which The Needles, The Grabens, and\r\nmost of the arches were sculptured; the Triassic Wingate Sandstone and\r\nthe Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation get second billing for their roles in\r\nforming and preserving Island in the Sky and other high mesas.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider other areas with only one or few players in the\r\ncast, beginning at the bottom of the time spiral. Black Canyon of the\r\nGunnison N.M., cut entirely in rocks of early Precambrian age with only\r\na veneer of much younger rocks, obviously has but one star in its cast.\r\nColorado N.M. contains rocks ranging from Precambrian to\r\nCretaceous—equal to Dinosaur in this respect, but Colorado is unique in\r\nthat all the rocks of the long Paleozoic Era and some others are missing\r\nfrom the cast; of those that remain, the Triassic Wingate and the\r\nTriassic(?) Kayenta are the stars, with strong support from the Jurassic\r\nEntrada Sandstone.\r\n\r\nAll the bridges in Natural Bridges N.M. were carved from the Permian\r\nCedar Mesa Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation, also one of the\r\nstars in Canyonlands N.P. In Canyon de Chelly (pronounced dee shay) N.M.\r\nand Monument Valley (neither a national park nor a national monument, as\r\nit is owned and administered by the Navajo Tribe), the De Chelly\r\nSandstone Member of the Cutler Formation—a Permian member younger than\r\nthe Cedar Mesa—plays the starring role.\r\n\r\nWupatki N.M. near Flagstaff, Ariz., stars the Triassic Moenkopi\r\nFormation. Petrified Forest N.P. (which now includes part of the Painted\r\nDesert) has but one star—the Triassic Chinle Formation, in which are\r\nfound many petrified logs and stumps of ancient trees. The\r\nTriassic-Jurassic Glen Canyon Group (fig. 19), which includes the\r\nTriassic Wingate Sandstone, the Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation, and the\r\nTriassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, receives top billing in recently\r\nenlarged Capitol Reef N.P., but the Triassic Moenkopi and Chinle\r\nFormations enjoy supporting roles.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, which has a supporting role\r\nin Arches N.P., is the undisputed star of Zion N.P., Rainbow Bridge\r\nN.M., and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, despite the fact that\r\nthe latter is the type locality of the entire Glen Canyon Group. The\r\nNavajo also forms the impressive reef at the east edge of the beautiful\r\nSan Rafael Swell, a dome, or closed anticline, now crossed by Highway\r\nI-70 between Green River and Fremont Junction, Utah.\r\n\r\nAs we journey upward in the time spiral (fig. 59), we come to the\r\nJurassic Entrada Sandstone, which stars in Arches N.P., with help from\r\nthe underlying Navajo Sandstone, and a supporting cast of both older and\r\nyounger rocks. The Entrada also forms the grotesque erosion forms called\r\n“hoodoos and goblins” in Goblin Valley State Park, north of Hanksville,\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\nMoving ever upward in the spiral, we come to the Cretaceous—the age of\r\nthe starring Mesaverde Group, in which the caves of Mesaverde N.P. were\r\nformed, and which now house beautifully preserved ruins once occupied by\r\nthe Anasazi, the same ancient people who once dwelt in Arches N.P. and\r\nnearby areas.\r\n\r\nThis brings us up to the Tertiary Period, during the early part of which\r\nthe pink limestones and shales of the Paleocene and Eocene Wasatch\r\nFormation were laid down in inland basins. Beautifully sculptured\r\ncliffs, pinnacles, and caves of the Wasatch star in Bryce Canyon N.P.\r\nand in nearby Cedar Breaks N.M. This concludes our climb up the time\r\nspiral, except for Quaternary volcanoes and some older volcanic features\r\nat Sunset Crater N.M., near Flagstaff, Ariz.\r\n\r\nThus, one way or another, many rock units formed during the last couple\r\nof billion years have performed on the stage of the Colorado Plateau\r\nand, hamlike, still lurk in the wings eagerly awaiting your applause to\r\nrecall them to the footlights. Don’t let them down—visit and enjoy the\r\nnational parks and monuments of the Plateau, for they probably are the\r\ngreatest collection of scenic wonderlands in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Additional Reading\r\n\r\n\r\nMany reports covering various aspects of the area have been cited in the\r\ntext by author and year, and these plus a few additional ones are listed\r\nin “Selected References.” A few works of general or special interest\r\nshould be mentioned, however.\r\n\r\nBetween 1926 and 1929 the entire area now included in the park was\r\nmapped geologically in classic reports by Dane (1935) and by McKnight\r\n(1940). These men and their field assistants mapped the area by use of\r\nthe plane-table and telescopic alidade without benefit of modern\r\ntopographic maps or aerial photographs, except for topographic maps of\r\nthe narrow stretch along the Colorado River mapped under the direction\r\nof Herron (1917). Only small sections could be reached by automobile, so\r\nnearly all the area was traversed using horses and mules or by hiking.\r\nThis work plus mapping done in nearby areas to the south and to the\r\nnorth (Stokes, 1952) during the uranium boom of the mid-fifties was used\r\nby Williams (1964) in compiling a geologic map of the Moab quadrangle at\r\na scale of 1:250,000.\r\n\r\nSeveral early reports on the Colorado River and its potential\r\nutilization contain a wealth of information and many fine photographs,\r\nincluding two by La Rue (1916, 1925) and one by Follansbee (1929).\r\n\r\nYou may be interested in brief accounts of the geology of other national\r\nparks and monuments, or other areas of special interest, such as the\r\nreports on the Uinta Mountains by Hansen (1969), Mount Rainier by\r\nCrandell (1969), Yellowstone National Park by Keefer (1971), and ones by\r\nme on Colorado National Monument (Lohman, 1965) and Canyonlands National\r\nPark (1974).\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to learn more about the science of geology, I suggest\r\nthe textbook by Gilluly, Waters, and Woodford (1968).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to Bates Wilson, former Superintendent, and to\r\nformer Assistant Superintendent Joe Carithers, for their splendid\r\ncooperation in supplying data and information; to Chuck Budge, former\r\nChief Ranger; Dave May, Assistant Chief of Interpretation and Resource\r\nManagement; Joe Miller, former Maintenance Engineer; Bob Kerr, new\r\nSuperintendent; Maxine Newell, Park Historian and member of the staff at\r\nArches National Park; Jerry Banta, former Park Ranger at Arches; and\r\nCarl Mikesell, Park Ranger at Arches, for their many favors.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to several colleagues and friends for the loan of\r\nphotographs, for geologic help and data, and for reviewing this report.\r\nI am also deeply grateful to my wife, Ruth, for accompanying me on all\r\nthe fieldwork and for her help and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Selected References\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbey, Edward, 1971, Desert solitaire, a season in the wilderness: New\r\n          York, Ballantine Books, 303 p.\r\n  Baker, A.

She has completed a revision entitled, “The\r\n    Far Country—A Regional History of Moab and La Sal, Utah,” which will\r\n    be serialized in the Moab Times-Independent, after which it will be\r\n    published.\r\n\r\n[2]For the benefit of visitors from countries in which the metric system\r\n    is used, the following conversion factors may be helpful: 1 inch =\r\n    2.54 centimeters, 1 foot = 0.305 meter, 1 mile = 1.609 kilometers, 1\r\n    U.S. gallon = 0.00379 cubic meter.\r\n\r\n[3]Barrier Creek flows through Horseshoe Canyon in the detached unit of\r\n    Canyonlands National Park. The canyon walls are adorned by striking\r\n    pictographs (Lohman, 1974, fig. 2). “Barrier Canyon style” is named\r\n    after the pictographs found in Horseshoe Canyon.\r\n\r\n[4]Plastic-relief maps are no longer available from the U.S. Army Map\r\n    Service but may be obtained from the T. N. Hubbard Scientific Co.,\r\n    Box 105, Northbrook, Ill. 60062. A topographic map at a scale of\r\n    1:250,000 of the Moab quadrangle and similar maps at a scale of\r\n    1:62,500 for the Thompson, Cisco, Moab, and Castle Valley\r\n    quadrangles are available from the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver\r\n    Distribution Section, Federal Center, Denver, Colo. 80225, from the\r\n    Canyonlands Natural History Association at Moab, and from privately\r\n    owned shops where maps are sold. Most of the park is covered by the\r\n    Thompson and Moab quadrangles. The southern part of the park is\r\n    shown also on the Moab 4 NW, Moab 4 NE, and Mt. Waas 3 NW\r\n    quadrangles at a scale of 1:24,000. A special topographic map of\r\n    Arches National Park at a scale of 1:50,000 is in preparation by the\r\n    U.S. Geological Survey. These maps also may be obtained from the\r\n    above-listed sources.\r\n\r\n[5]This is numbered stop 1 in the booklet referred to earlier “The Guide\r\n    to an Auto Tour of Arches National Park,” and corresponds to the\r\n    numeral one on a small sign at the roadside parking place.
