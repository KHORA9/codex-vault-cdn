A range of high hills skirts\r\nits western side, and stretches away to the north as far as the eye\r\ncan reach; while before the village, toward the east, flows the\r\nKennebec River.\r\n\r\nNear the base of the hills a beautiful stream, known as Glen's Creek,\r\nhas its source; and, after winding through the adjacent meadows, and\r\nreaching almost around the village, finally empties into the Kennebec.\r\nIts waters are deep and clear, and flow over a rough, gravelly bed,\r\nand under high banks, and through many a little nook where the perch\r\nand sunfish love to hide. This creek, about half a mile from its\r\nmouth, branches off, forming two streams, the smaller of which flows\r\nsouth, parallel with the river for a short distance, and finally\r\nempties into it. This stream is known as Ducks' Creek, and it is very\r\nappropriately named; for, although it is but a short distance from the\r\nvillage, every autumn, and until late in the spring, its waters are\r\nfairly alive with wild ducks, which find secure retreats among the\r\nhigh bushes and reeds which line its banks. The island formed by these\r\ntwo creeks is called Reynard's Island, from the fact that for several\r\nyears a sly old fox had held possession of it in spite of the efforts\r\nof the village boys to capture him. The island contains, perhaps,\r\ntwenty-five acres, and is thickly covered with hickory-trees; and\r\nthere is an annual strife between the village boys and the squirrels,\r\nto see which can gather the greater quantity of nuts.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite the village, near the middle of the river, is\r\nanother island, called Strawberry Island, from the great quantity of\r\nthat fruit which it produces.\r\n\r\nThe fishing-grounds about the village are excellent. The river affords\r\ngreat numbers of perch, black bass, pike, and muscalonge; and the\r\nnumberless little streams that intersect the country fairly swarm with\r\ntrout, and the woods abound in game. This attracts sportsmen from\r\nother places; and the _Julia Burton_, the little steamer that plies up\r\nand down the river, frequently brings large parties of amateur\r\nhunters and fishermen, who sometimes spend months enjoying the rare\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nIt was on the banks of Glen's Creek, about half a mile from the\r\nvillage, in a neat little cottage that stood back from the road, and\r\nwhich was almost concealed by the thick shrubbery and trees that\r\nsurrounded it, that FRANK NELSON, the young naturalist, lived. His\r\nfather had been a wealthy merchant in the city of Boston; and, after\r\nhis death, Mrs. Nelson had removed into the country with her children,\r\nand bought the place of which we are speaking. Frank was a handsome,\r\nhigh-spirited boy, about sixteen years of age. He was kind,\r\nopen-hearted, and generous; and no one in the village had more friends\r\nthan he. But his most prominent characteristic was perseverance. He\r\nwas a slow thinker, and some, perhaps, at first sight, would have\r\npronounced him \"dull;\" but the unyielding application with which he\r\ndevoted himself to his studies, or to any thing else he undertook,\r\novercame all obstacles; and he was further advanced, and his knowledge\r\nwas more thorough than that of any other boy of the same age in the\r\nvillage. He never gave up any thing he undertook because he found it\r\nmore difficult than he had expected, or hurried over it in a\r\n\"slipshod\" manner, for his motto was, \"Whatever is worth doing at all,\r\nis worth doing well.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we write Frank was just entering upon what he\r\ncalled a \"long vacation.\" He had attended the high-school of which the\r\nvillage boasted for nearly eight years, with no intermission but the\r\nvacations, and during this time he had devoted himself with untiring\r\nenergy to his studies. He loved his books, and they were his constant\r\ncompanions. By intense application he succeeded in working his way\r\ninto the highest class in school, which was composed of young men much\r\nolder than himself, and who looked upon him, not as a fellow-student,\r\nbut as a rival, and used every exertion to prevent him from keeping\r\npace with them. But Frank held his own in spite of their efforts, and\r\nnot unfrequently paid them back in their own coin by committing his\r\nlessons more thoroughly than they.\r\n\r\nThings went on so for a considerable time. Frank, whose highest\r\nambition was to be called the best scholar in his class, kept steadily\r\ngaining ground, and one by one the rival students were overtaken and\r\ndistanced. But Frank had some smart scholars matched against him, and\r\nhe knew that the desired reputation was not to be obtained without a\r\nfierce struggle; and every moment, both in and out of school, was\r\ndevoted to study.\r\n\r\nHe had formerly been passionately fond of rural sports, hunting and\r\nfishing, but now his fine double-barrel gun, which he had always taken\r\nespecial care to keep in the best possible \"shooting order,\" hung in\r\nits accustomed place, all covered with dust. His fishing-rod and\r\nbasket were in the same condition; and Bravo, his fine hunting-dog,\r\nwhich was very much averse to a life of inactivity, made use of his\r\nmost eloquent whines in vain.\r\n\r\nAt last Frank's health began to fail rapidly. His mother was the first\r\nto notice it, and at the suggestion of her brother, who lived in\r\nPortland, she decided to take Frank out of school for at least one\r\nyear, and allow him but two hours each day for study. Perhaps some of\r\nour young readers would have been very much pleased at the thought of\r\nso long a respite from the tiresome duties of school; but it was a\r\nsevere blow to Frank. A few more months, he was confident, would have\r\ncarried him ahead of all competitors. But he always submitted to his\r\nmother's requirements, no matter how much at variance with his own\r\nwishes, without murmuring; and when the spring term was ended he took\r\nhis books under his arm, and bade a sorrowful farewell to his\r\nmuch-loved school-room.\r\n\r\nIt is June, and as Frank has been out of school almost two months,\r\nthings begin to wear their old, accustomed look again. The young\r\nnaturalist's home, as his schoolmates were accustomed to say, is a\r\n\"regular curiosity shop.\" Perhaps, reader, if we take a stroll about\r\nthe premises, we can find something to interest us.\r\n\r\nFrank's room, which he called his \"study,\" is in the south wing of the\r\ncottage. It has two windows, one looking out toward the road, and the\r\nother covered with a thick blind of climbing roses, which almost shut\r\nout the light. A bookcase stands beside one of the windows, and if you\r\nwere to judge from the books it contained, you would pronounce Frank\r\nquite a literary character. The two upper shelves are occupied by\r\nmiscellaneous books, such as Cooper's novels, Shakspeare's works, and\r\nthe like. On the next two shelves stand Frank's choicest\r\nbooks--natural histories; there are sixteen large volumes, and he\r\nknows them almost by heart. The drawers in the lower part of the case\r\nare filled on one side with writing materials, and on the other with\r\nold compositions, essays, and orations, some of which exhibit a power\r\nof imagination and a knowledge of language hardly to be expected in a\r\nboy of Frank's age. On the top of the case, at either end, stand the\r\nbusts of Clay and Webster, and between them are two relics of\r\nRevolutionary times, a sword and musket crossed, with the words\r\n\"Bunker Hill\" printed on a slip of paper fastened to them. On the\r\nopposite side of the room stands a bureau, the drawers of which are\r\nfilled with clothing, and on the top are placed two beautiful\r\nspecimens of Frank's handiwork. One is a model of a \"fore-and-aft\"\r\nschooner, with whose rigging or hull the most particular tar could not\r\nfind fault. The other represents a \"scene at sea.\" It is inclosed in a\r\nbox about two feet long and a foot and a half in hight. One side of\r\nthe box is glass, and through it can be seen two miniature vessels.\r\nThe craft in the foreground would be known among sailors as a \"Jack.\"\r\nShe is neither a brig nor a bark, but rather a combination of both.\r\nShe is armed, and the cannon can be seen protruding from her\r\nport-holes. Every sail is set, and she seems to be making great\r\nexertion to escape from the other vessel, which is following close in\r\nher wake. The flag which floats at her peak, bearing the sign of the\r\n\"skull and cross-bones,\" explains it all: the \"Jack\" is a pirate; and\r\nyou could easily tell by the long, low, black hull, and tall, raking\r\nmasts that her pursuer is a revenue cutter. The bottom of the box, to\r\nwhich the little vessels are fastened in such a manner that they\r\nappear to \"heel\" under the pressure of their canvas, is cut out in\r\nlittle hollows, and painted blue, with white caps, to resemble the\r\nwaves of the ocean; while a thick, black thunder-cloud, which is\r\npainted on the sides of the box, and appears to be rising rapidly,\r\nwith the lightning playing around its ragged edges, adds greatly to\r\nthe effect of the scene.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of the room stands a case similar to the one in which\r\nFrank keeps his books, only it is nearly twice as large. It is filled\r\nwith stuffed \"specimens\"--birds, nearly two hundred in number. There\r\nare bald eagles, owls, sparrows, hawks, cranes, crows, a number of\r\ndifferent species of ducks, and other water-fowl; in short, almost\r\nevery variety of the feathered creation that inhabited the woods\r\naround Lawrence is here represented.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the room stands a bed concealed by curtains.\r\nBefore it is a finely carved wash-stand, on which are a pitcher and\r\nbowl, and a towel nicely folded lies beside them. In the corner, at\r\nthe foot of the bed, is what Frank called his \"sporting cabinet.\" A\r\nframe has been erected by placing two posts against the wall, about\r\nfour feet apart; and three braces, pieces of board about six inches\r\nwide, and long enough to reach from one post to the other, are\r\nfastened securely to them. On the upper brace a fine jointed\r\nfish-pole, such as is used in \"heavy\" fishing, protected by a neat,\r\nstrong bag of drilling, rests on hooks which have been driven securely\r\ninto the frame; and from another hook close by hangs a large\r\nfish-basket which Frank, who is a capital fisherman, has often brought\r\nin filled with the captured denizens of the river or some favorite\r\ntrout-stream. On the next lower brace hang a powder-flask and\r\nshot-pouch and a double-barrel shot-gun, the latter protected from the\r\ndamp and dust by a thick, strong covering. On the lower brace hang the\r\nclothes the young naturalist always wears when he goes hunting or\r\nfishing--a pair of sheep's-gray pantaloons, which will resist water\r\nand dirt to the last extremity, a pair of long boots, a blue\r\nflannel-shirt, such as is generally worn by the sailors, and an\r\nIndia-rubber coat and cap for rainy weather. A shelf has been fastened\r\nover the frame, and on this stands a tin box, which Frank calls his\r\n\"fishing-box.\" It is divided into apartments, which are filled with\r\nfish-hooks, sinkers, bobbers, artificial flies, spoon-hooks, reels,\r\nand other tackle, all kept in the nicest order.\r\n\r\nFrank had one sister, but no brothers. Her name was Julia. She was ten\r\nyears of age; and no boy ever had a lovelier sister. Like her brother,\r\nshe was unyielding in perseverance, but kind and trusting in\r\ndisposition, willing to be told her faults that she might correct\r\nthem. Mrs. Nelson was a woman of good, sound sense; always required\r\nimplicit obedience of her children; never flattered them, nor allowed\r\nothers to do so if she could prevent it. The only other inmate of the\r\nhouse was Aunt Hannah, as the children called her. She had formerly\r\nbeen a slave in Virginia, and, after years of toil, had succeeded in\r\nlaying by sufficient money to purchase her freedom. We have already\r\nspoken of Frank's dog; but were we to allow the matter to drop here it\r\nwould be a mortal offense in the eyes of the young naturalist, for\r\nBravo held a very prominent position in his affections. He was a\r\npure-blooded Newfoundland, black as jet, very active and courageous,\r\nand there was nothing in the hunting line that he did not understand;\r\nand it was a well-established saying among the young Nimrods of the\r\nvillage, that Frank, with Bravo's assistance, could kill more\r\nsquirrels in any given time than any three boys in Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAn Ugly Customer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly behind the cottage stands a long, low, neatly constructed\r\nbuilding, which is divided by partitions into three rooms, of which\r\none is used as a wood-shed, another for a carpenter's shop, and the\r\nthird is what Frank calls his \"museum.\" It contains stuffed birds and\r\nanimals, souvenirs of many a well-contested fight. Let us go and\r\nexamine them. About the middle of the building is the door which leads\r\ninto the museum, and, as you enter, the first object that catches your\r\neye is a large wild-cat, crouched on a stand which is elevated about\r\nfour feet above the floor, his back arched, every hair in his body\r\nsticking toward his head, his mouth open, displaying a frightful array\r\nof teeth, his ears laid back close to his head, and his sharp claws\r\nspread out, presenting altogether a savage appearance; and you are\r\nglad that you see him dead and stuffed, and not alive and running at\r\nliberty in the forest in the full possession of strength. But the\r\nyoung naturalist once stood face to face with this ugly customer under\r\nvery different circumstances.\r\n\r\nAbout forty miles north of Lawrence lives an old man named Joseph\r\nLewis. He owns about five hundred acres of land, and in summer he\r\n\"farms it\" very industriously; but as soon as the trapping season\r\napproaches he leaves his property to the care of his hired men, and\r\nspends most of the time in the woods. About two-thirds of his farm is\r\nstill in its primeval state, and bears, wild-cats, and panthers abound\r\nin great numbers. The village boys are never more delighted than when\r\nthe winter vacation comes, and they can gain the permission of their\r\nparents to spend a fortnight with \"Uncle Joe,\" as they call him.\r\n\r\nThe old man is always glad to see them, and enlivens the long winter\r\nevenings with many a thrilling story of his early life. During the\r\nwinter that had just passed, Frank, in company with his cousin Archie\r\nWinters, of whom more hereafter, paid a visit to Uncle Joe. One cold,\r\nstormy morning, as they sat before a blazing fire, cracking\r\nhickory-nuts, the farmer burst suddenly into the house, which was\r\nbuilt of logs, and contained but one room, and commenced taking down\r\nhis rifle.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Uncle Joe?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Matter!\" repeated the farmer; \"why, some carnal varmint got into my\r\nsheep-pen last night, and walked off with some of my mutton. Come,\" he\r\ncontinued, as he slung on his bullet-pouch, \"let's go and shoot him.\"\r\n\r\nFrank and Archie were ready in a few minutes; and, after dropping a\r\ncouple of buck-shot into each barrel of their guns, followed the\r\nfarmer out to the sheep-pen. It was storming violently, and it was\r\nwith great difficulty that they could find the \"varmint's\" track.\r\nAfter half an hour's search, however, with the assistance of the\r\nfarmer's dogs, they discovered it, and began to follow it up, the dogs\r\nleading the way. But the snow had fallen so deep that it almost\r\ncovered the scent, and they frequently found themselves at fault.\r\nAfter following the track for two hours, the dogs suddenly stopped at\r\na pile of hemlock-boughs, and began to whine and scratch as if they\r\nhad discovered something.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Uncle Joe, dropping his rifle into the hollow of his arm,\r\n\"the hounds have found some of the mutton, but the varmint has took\r\nhimself safe off.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys quickly threw aside the boughs, and in a few moments the\r\nmangled remains of one of the sheep were brought to light. The thief\r\nhad probably had more than enough for one meal, and had hidden the\r\nsurplus carefully away, intending, no doubt, to return and make a\r\nmeal of it when food was not quite so plenty.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, boys,\" said the farmer, \"no use to try to foller the varmint any\r\nfurther. Put the sheep back where you found it, and this afternoon you\r\ncan take one of your traps and set it so that you can ketch him when\r\nhe comes back for what he has left.\" So saying, he shouldered his\r\nrifle and walked off, followed by his hounds.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the boys had placed every thing as they had found it\r\nas nearly as possible, and hurried on after the farmer.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, after disposing of an excellent dinner, Frank and\r\nArchie started into the woods to set a trap for the thief. They took\r\nwith them a large wolf-trap, weighing about thirty pounds. It was a\r\n\"savage thing,\" as Uncle Joe said, with a powerful spring on each\r\nside, which severely taxed their united strength in setting it; and\r\nits thick, stout jaws, which came together with a noise like the\r\nreport of a gun, were armed with long, sharp teeth; and if a wolf or\r\npanther once got his foot between them, he might as well give up\r\nwithout a struggle. Instead of their guns, each shouldered an ax.\r\nFrank took possession of the trap, and Archie carried a piece of heavy\r\nchain with which to fasten the \"clog\" to the trap. Half an hour's walk\r\nbrought them to the place where the wild-cat had buried his plunder.\r\nAfter considerable exertion they succeeded in setting the trap, and\r\nplaced it in such a manner that it would be impossible for any animal\r\nto get at the sheep without being caught. The chain was them fastened\r\nto the trap, and to this was attached the clog, which was a long,\r\nheavy limb. Trappers, when they wish to take such powerful animals as\r\nthe bear or panther, always make use of the clog. They never fasten\r\nthe trap to a stationary object. When the animal finds that he is\r\ncaught, his first impulse is to run. The clog is not heavy enough to\r\nhold him still, but as he drags it through the woods, it is\r\ncontinually catching on bushes and frees, and retarding his progress.\r\nBut if the animal should find himself unable to move at all, his long,\r\nsharp teeth would be put to immediate use, and he would hobble off on\r\nthree feet, leaving the other in the trap.\r\n\r\nAfter adjusting the clog to their satisfaction, they threw a few\r\nhandfuls of snow over the trap and chain, and, after bestowing a few\r\nfinishing touches, they shouldered their axes and started toward the\r\nhouse. The next morning, at the first peep of day, Frank and Archie\r\nstarted for the woods, with their dogs close at their heels. As they\r\napproached the spot where the trap had been placed they held their\r\nguns in readiness, expecting to find the wild-cat secure. But they\r\nwere disappointed; every thing was just as they had left it, and\r\nthere were no signs of the wild-cat having been about during the\r\nnight. Every night and morning for a week they were regular in their\r\nvisits to the trap, but not even a twig had been moved. Two weeks more\r\npassed, and during this time they visited the trap but once. At length\r\nthe time allotted for their stay at Uncle Joe's expired. On the\r\nevening previous to the day set for their departure, as they sat\r\nbefore the huge, old-fashioned fireplace, telling stories and eating\r\nnuts. Uncle Joe suddenly inquired, \"Boys, did you bring in your trap\r\nthat you set for that wild-cat?\"\r\n\r\nThey had not thought of it; they had been hunting nearly every day,\r\nenjoying rare sport, and they had entirely forgotten that they had a\r\ntrap to look after.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged to let it go until to-morrow,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd the next morning, as soon as it was light, he was up and dressed,\r\nand shouldering an ax, set out with Brave as a companion, leaving\r\nArchie in a sound sleep. It was very careless in him not to take his\r\ngun--a \"regular boy's trick,\" as Uncle Joe afterward remarked; but it\r\ndid not then occur to him that he was acting foolishly; and he trudged\r\noff, whistling merrily. A few moments' rapid walking brought him to\r\nthe place where the trap had been set. How he started! There lay the\r\nremains of the sheep all exposed. The snow near it was saturated with\r\nblood, and the trap, clog, and all were gone. What was he to do? He\r\nwas armed with an ax, and he knew that with it he could make but a\r\npoor show of resistance against an enraged wild animal; and he knew,\r\ntoo, that one that could walk off with fifty pounds fast to his leg\r\nwould be an ugly customer to handle. He had left Brave some distance\r\nback, digging at a hole in a stump where a mink had taken refuge, and\r\nhe had not yet come up. If the Newfoundlander had been by his side he\r\nwould have felt comparatively safe. Frank stood for some minutes\r\nundecided how to act. Should he go back to the house and get\r\nassistance? Even if he had concluded to do so he would not have\r\nconsidered himself a coward; for, attacking a wounded wild-cat in the\r\nwoods, with nothing but an ax to depend on, was an undertaking that\r\nwould have made a larger and stronger person than Frank hesitate.\r\nTheir astonishing activity and strength, and wonderful tenacity of\r\nlife, render them antagonists not to be despised. Besides, Frank was\r\nbut a boy, and although strong and active for his age, and possessing\r\na good share of determined courage that sometimes amounted almost to\r\nrashness, it must be confessed that his feelings were not of the most\r\nenviable nature. He had not yet discovered the animal, but he knew\r\nthat he could not be a great distance off, for the weight of the trap\r\nand clog would retard him exceedingly; and he judged, from the\r\nappearance of things, that he had not been long in the trap; perhaps,\r\nat that very moment, his glaring eyes were fastened upon him from some\r\nneighboring thicket.\r\n\r\nBut the young naturalist was not one to hesitate long because there\r\nwas difficulty or danger before him. He had made up his mind from the\r\nfirst to capture that wild-cat if possible, and now the opportunity\r\nwas fairly before him. His hand was none of the steadiest as he drew\r\noff his glove and placed his fingers to his lips; and the whistle that\r\nfollowed was low and tremulous, very much unlike the loud, clear call\r\nwith which he was accustomed to let Brave know that he was wanted and\r\nhe hardly expected that the dog would hear it. A faint, distant bark,\r\nhowever, announced that the call had been heard, and in a few moments\r\nFrank heard Brave's long-measured bounds as he dashed through the\r\nbushes; and when the faithful animal came in sight, he felt that he\r\nhad a friend that would stand by him to the last extremity. At this\r\njuncture Frank was startled by a loud rattling in the bushes, and the\r\nnext moment the wild-cat sprang upon a fallen log, not half a dozen\r\nrods from the place where he was standing, and, growling fiercely,\r\ncrouched and lashed his sides with his tail as if about to spring\r\ntoward him. The trap hung from one of his hind-legs, but by some means\r\nhe had relieved himself of the clog and chain, and he moved as if the\r\nweight of the trap were no inconvenience whatever. The young\r\nnaturalist was frightened indeed, but bravely stood his ground, and\r\nclutched his ax desperately. What would he not have given to have had\r\nhis trusty double-barrel in his hands! But he was not allowed much\r\ntime for reflection. Brave instantly discovered the wild-cat, and\r\nsprang toward him, uttering an angry growl. Frank raised his ax and\r\nrushed forward to his assistance, and cheered on the dog with a voice\r\nwhich, to save his life, he could not raise above a whisper. The\r\nwild-cat crouched lower along the log, and his actions seemed to\r\nindicate that he intended to show fight. Brave's long, eager bounds\r\nbrought him nearer and nearer to his enemy. A moment more and he could\r\nhave seized him; but the wild-cat suddenly turned and sprang lightly\r\ninto the air, and, catching his claws into a tree that stood full\r\ntwenty feet distant, ascended it like a streak of light; and, after\r\nsettling himself between two large limbs, glared down upon his foes as\r\nif he were already ashamed of having made a retreat, and had half a\r\nmind to return and give them battle. Brave reached the log just a\r\nmoment too late, and finding his enemy fairly out of his reach, he\r\nquietly seated himself at the foot of the tree and waited for Frank to\r\ncome up.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the young naturalist, wiping his forehead\r\nwith his coat-sleeve, (for the exciting scene through which he had\r\njust passed had brought the cold sweat from every pore in his body);\r\n\"it is a lucky circumstance for you and me, Brave, that the varmint\r\ndid not stand and show fight.\"\r\n\r\nThen ordering the dog to \"sit down and watch him,\" the young\r\nnaturalist threw down his ax, and started toward the house for his\r\ngun. He was still very much excited, fearful that the wild-cat might\r\ntake it into his head to come down and give the dog battle, in which\r\ncase he would be certain to escape; for, although Brave was a very\r\npowerful and courageous dog, he could make but a poor show against the\r\nsharp teeth and claws of the wild-cat. The more Frank thought of it,\r\nthe more excited he became, and the faster he ran. In a very few\r\nmoments he reached the house, and burst into the room where Uncle Joe\r\nand Archie and two or three hired men sat at breakfast. Frank seemed\r\nnot to notice them, but made straight across the room toward the place\r\nwhere his shot-gun hung against the wall, upsetting chairs in his\r\nprogress, and creating a great confusion.\r\n\r\n\"What in tarnation is the matter?\" exclaimed the farmer, rising to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"I've found the wild-cat,\" answered Frank, in a scarcely audible\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" shouted Archie, springing to his feet, and upsetting\r\nhis chair and coffee-cup.\r\n\r\nBut Frank could not wait to answer. One bound carried him across the\r\nfloor and out of the door, and he started across the field at the top\r\nof his speed, dropping a handful of buck-shot into each barrel of his\r\ngun as he went. It was not until Frank had left the house that Archie,\r\nso to speak, came to himself. He had been so astonished at his\r\ncousin's actions and the announcement that he had \"found the\r\nwild-cat,\" that he seemed to be deprived of action. But Frank had not\r\nmade a dozen steps from the house before Archie made a dash for his\r\ngun, and occasioned a greater uproar than Frank had done; and, not\r\nstopping to hear the farmer's injunction to \"be careful,\" he darted\r\nout the door, which Frank in his hurry had left open, and started\r\ntoward the woods at a rate of speed that would have done credit to a\r\nlarger boy than himself. But Frank gained rapidly on him; and when he\r\nreached the tree where the wild-cat had taken refuge, Archie was full\r\ntwenty rods behind. He found that the animals had not changed their\r\npositions. The wild-cat was glaring fiercely down upon the dog as if\r\nendeavoring to look him out of countenance; and Brave, seated on his\r\nhaunches, with his head turned on one side, and his tongue hanging out\r\nof the side of his mouth, was steadily returning the gaze. Frank took\r\na favorable position at a little distance from the foot of the tree,\r\nand cocking both barrels, so as to be ready for any emergency, in case\r\nthe first should not prove fatal, raised his gun to his shoulder, and\r\nglancing along the clean, brown tube, covered one of the wild-cat's\r\neyes with the fatal sight, and pressed the trigger. There was a sharp\r\nreport, and the animal fell from his perch stone-dead. At this moment\r\nArchie came up. After examining their prize to their satisfaction, the\r\nboys commenced looking around through the bushes to find the clog\r\nwhich had been detached from the trap. After some moments' search they\r\ndiscovered it; and Archie unfastened the chain, and shouldering the ax\r\nand guns, he started toward the house. Frank followed after, with the\r\nwild-cat on his shoulder, the trap still hanging to his leg. The skin\r\nwas carefully taken off; and when Archie and Frank got home, they\r\nstuffed it, and placed it as we now see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to examine the other objects in the museum. A wide\r\nshelf, elevated about four feet above the floor, extends entirely\r\naround the room, and on this the specimens are mounted. On one side of\r\nthe door stands a tall, majestic elk, with his head thrown forward,\r\nand his wide-spreading antlers lowered, as if he meant to dispute our\r\nentrance. On the opposite side is a large black fox, which stands with\r\none foot raised and his ears thrown forward, as if listening to some\r\nstrange sound. This is the same fox which so long held possession of\r\nReynard's Island; and the young naturalist and his cousin were the\r\nones who succeeded in capturing him. The next two scenes are what\r\nFrank calls his \"masterpieces.\" The first is a large buck, running for\r\ndear life, closely followed by a pack of gaunt, hungry wolves, five in\r\nnumber, with their sharp-pointed ears laid back close to their heads,\r\ntheir tongues hanging out of their mouths, and their lips spotted with\r\nfoam The flanks of the buck are dripping with blood from wounds made\r\nby their long teeth. In the next scene the buck is at bay. Almost\r\ntired out, or, perhaps, too closely pressed by his pursuers, he has at\r\nlength turned furiously upon them, to sell his life as dearly as\r\npossible. Two of the wolves are lying a little distance off, where\r\nthey have been tossed by the powerful buck, one dead, the other\r\ndisabled; and the buck's sharp antlers are buried deep in the side of\r\nanother, which had attempted to seize him.\r\n\r\nWell may Frank be proud of these specimens, for they are admirably\r\nexecuted. The animals are neatly stuffed, and look so lifelike and the\r\npositions are so natural, that you could almost fancy that you hear\r\nthe noise of the scuffle. The next scene represents an owl, which,\r\nwhile engaged in one of his nocturnal plundering expeditions, has been\r\novertaken by daylight, and not being able to reach his usual\r\nhiding-place, he has taken refuge in a clump of bushes, where he has\r\nbeen discovered by a flock of his inveterate enemies, the crows. The\r\nowl sits upon his perch, glaring around with his great eyes, while his\r\ntormentors surround him on all sides, their mouths wide open, as if\r\nreviling their enemy with all their might. The next scene represents a\r\nflock of ducks sporting in the water, and a sly old fox, concealed\r\nbehind the trunk of a tree close by, is watching their motions,\r\nevidently with the intention of \"bagging\" one of them for his supper.\r\nIn the next scene he is running off, at full speed, with one of the\r\nducks thrown over his shoulder; and the others, with their mouths open\r\nas if quacking loudly, are just rising from the water. In the next\r\nscene is a large black wolf, which has just killed a lamb, and\r\ncrouches over it with open mouth, as if growling fiercely at something\r\nwhich is about to interrupt his feast. The next scene represents a\r\nfish-hawk, which has just risen from the lake, with a large trout\r\nstruggling in his talons; and just above him is a bald-eagle, with his\r\nwings drawn close to his body, in the act of swooping down upon the\r\nfish-hawk, to rob him of his hard-earned booty. In the next scene a\r\nraccoon is attempting to seize a robin, which he has frightened off\r\nher nest. The thief had crawled out on the limb on which the nest was\r\nplaced, intending, no doubt, to make a meal of the bird; but mother\r\nRobin, ever on the watch, had discovered her enemy, and flown off just\r\nin time to escape. The next scene is a large \"dead-fall\" trap, nicely\r\nset, with the bait placed temptingly within; and before it crouches a\r\nsleek marten, peeping into it as if undecided whether to enter or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAll these specimens have been cured and stuffed by Frank and Archie;\r\nand, with the exception of the deer and wolves, they had killed them\r\nall. The latter had been furnished by Archie's father. The boys had\r\nnever killed a deer, and he had promised to take them, during the\r\ncoming winter with him up into the northern part of the state, where\r\nthey would have an opportunity of trying their skill on the noble\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nBut the museum is not the only thing that has given Frank the name of\r\nthe \"young naturalist.\" He is passionately fond of pets, and he has a\r\npole shanty behind the museum, which he keeps well stocked with\r\nanimals and birds. In one cage he has a young hawk, which he has just\r\ncaptured; in another, a couple of squirrels, which have become so tame\r\nthat he can allow them to run about the shanty without the least fear\r\nof their attempting to escape. Then he has two raccoons, several\r\npigeons, kingbirds, quails, two young eagles, and a fox, all\r\nundergoing a thorough system of training. But his favorite pets are a\r\npair of kingbirds and a crow, which are allowed to run at large all\r\nthe time. They do not live on very good terms with each other. In\r\ntheir wild state they are enemies, and each seems to think the other\r\nhas no business about the cottage; and Frank has been the unwilling\r\nwitness to many a desperate fight between them, in which the poor\r\ncrow always comes off second best. Then, to console himself, he will\r\nfly upon Frank's shoulder, cawing with all his might, as if scolding\r\nhim for not lending some assistance. To make amends for his defeat,\r\nFrank gives him a few kernels of corn, and then shows him a hawk\r\nsailing through the air; and Sam, as he calls the crow, is off in an\r\ninstant, and, after tormenting the hawk until he reaches the woods, he\r\nwill always return.\r\n\r\nNot a strange bird is allowed to come about the cottage. The\r\nkingbirds, which have a nest in a tree close by the house, keep a\r\nsharp look-out; and hawks, eagles, crows, and even those of their own\r\nspecies, all suffer alike. But now and then a spry little wren pays a\r\nvisit to the orchard, and then there is sport indeed. The wren is a\r\ngreat fighting character, continually getting into broils with the\r\nother birds, and he has no notion of being driven off; and, although\r\nthe kingbirds, with Sam's assistance, generally succeed in expelling\r\nthe intruder, it is only after a hard fight.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite the door that opens into the museum is another\r\nentrance, which leads into a room which Frank calls his shop. A\r\nwork-bench has been neatly fitted up in one corner, at the end of\r\nwhich stands a large chest filled with carpenter's tools. On the bench\r\nare several half-finished specimens of Frank's skill--a jointed\r\nfish-pole, two or three finely-shaped hulls, and a miniature frigate,\r\nwhich he is making for one of his friends. The shop and tools are kept\r\nin the nicest order, and Frank spends every rainy day at his bench.\r\n\r\nThe young naturalist is also a good sailor, and has the reputation of\r\nunderstanding the management of a sail-boat as well as any other boy\r\nin the village. He has two boats, which are in the creek, tied to the\r\nwharf in front of the house. One of them is a light skiff, which he\r\nfrequently uses in going to and from the village and on his fishing\r\nexcursions, and the other is a scow, about twenty feet long and six\r\nfeet wide, which he built himself. He calls her the Speedwell. He has\r\nno sail-boat, but he has passed hour after hour trying to conjure up\r\nsome plan by which he might be enabled to possess himself of one. Such\r\na one as he wants, and as most of the village have, would cost fifty\r\ndollars. Already he has laid by half that amount; but how is he to get\r\nthe rest? He has begun to grow impatient. The yachting season has just\r\nopened; every day the river is dotted with white sails; trials of\r\nspeed between the swiftest sailers come off almost every hour, and he\r\nis obliged to stand and look on, or content himself with rowing around\r\nin his skiff. It is true he has many friends who are always willing to\r\nallow him a seat in their boats, but that does not satisfy him. He has\r\ndetermined to have a yacht of his own, if there is any honest way for\r\nhim to get it. For almost a year he has carefully laid aside every\r\npenny, and but half the necessary sum has been saved. How to get the\r\nremainder is the difficulty. He never asks his mother for money; he is\r\ntoo independent for that; besides, he has always been taught to rely\r\non his own resources, and he has made up his mind that, if he can not\r\n_earn_ his boat, he will go without it.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the commencement of our story, Frank might\r\nhave been seen, about five o'clock one pleasant morning, seated on the\r\nwharf in front of the house, with Brave at his side. The question how\r\nhe should get his boat had been weighing heavily upon his mind, and he\r\nhad come to the conclusion that something must be done, and that\r\nspeedily.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he soliloquized, \"my chance of getting a sail-boat this season\r\nis rather slim, I'm afraid. But I've made up my mind to have one, and\r\nI won't give it up now. Let me see! I wonder how the Sunbeam [meaning\r\nhis skiff] would sail? I mean to try her. No,\" he added, on second\r\nthought, \"she couldn't carry canvas enough to sail with one of the\r\nvillage yachts. I have it!\" he exclaimed at length, springing to his\r\nfeet. \"The Speedwell! I wonder if I couldn't make a sloop of her. At\r\nany rate, I will get her up into my shop and try it.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, while he was paying a visit to his cousin in Portland, had\r\nwitnessed a regatta, in which the Peerless, a large, schooner-rigged\r\nscow, had beaten the swiftest yachts of which the city boasted; and he\r\nsaw no reason why his scow could not do the same. The idea was no\r\nsooner conceived than he proceeded to put it into execution. He sprang\r\nup the bank, with Brave close at his heels, and in a few moments\r\ndisappeared in the wood-shed. A large wheelbarrow stood in one corner\r\nof the shed, and this Frank pulled from its place, and, after taking\r\noff the sides, wheeled it down to the creek, and placed it on the\r\nbeach, a little distance below the wharf. He then untied the\r\npainter--a long rope by which the scow was fastened to the wharf--and\r\ndrew the scow down to the place where he had left the wheelbarrow. He\r\nstood for some moments holding the end of the painter in his hand, and\r\nthinking how he should go to work to get the scow, which was very\r\nheavy and unwieldy, upon the wheelbarrow. But Frank was a true Yankee,\r\nand fruitful in expedients, and he soon hit upon a plan, which he was\r\nabout putting into execution, when a strong, cheery voice called out:\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, me boy! What'll yer be after doing with the boat?\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked up and saw Uncle Mike, as the boys called him--a\r\ngood-natured Irishman, who lived in a small rustic cottage not far\r\nfrom Mrs. Nelson's--coming down the bank.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Uncle Mike,\" said Frank, politely accepting the\r\nIrishman's proffered hand and shaking it cordially. \"I want to get\r\nthis scow up to my shop; but I'm afraid it is a little too heavy for\r\nme to manage.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, intirely,\" said Mike, as he divested himself of his coat,\r\nand commenced rolling up his shirt-sleeves. \"Allow me to lend yer a\r\nhelpin' hand.\" And, taking the painter from Frank's hand, he drew the\r\nscow out of the water, high upon the bank. He then placed his strong\r\narms under one side of the boat, and Frank took hold of the other,\r\nand, lifting together, they raised it from the ground, and placed it\r\nupon the wheelbarrow. \"Now, Master Frank,\" said Mike, \"if you will\r\ntake hold and steady her, I'll wheel her up to the shop for you.\"\r\n\r\nFrank accordingly placed his hands upon the boat in such a manner that\r\nhe could keep her steady and assist Mike at the same time; and the\r\nlatter, taking hold of the \"handles,\" as he termed them, commenced\r\nwheeling her up the bank. The load was heavy, but Mike was a sturdy\r\nfellow, and the scow was soon at the door of the shop. Frank then\r\nplaced several sticks of round wood, which he had brought out of the\r\nwood-shed, upon the ground, about three feet apart, to serve as\r\nrollers, and, by their united efforts, the Speedwell was placed upon\r\nher side on these rollers, and in a few moments was left bottom upward\r\non the floor of the shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA Race on the Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed, and the Speedwell again rode proudly at her moorings,\r\nin front of the cottage; but her appearance was greatly changed. A\r\n\"center-board\" and several handy lockers had been neatly fitted up in\r\nher, and her long, low hull painted black on the outside and white on\r\nthe inside; and her tall, raking mast and faultless rigging gave her\r\nquite a ship-like appearance.\r\n\r\nFrank had just been putting on a few finishing touches, and now stood\r\non the wharf admiring her. It was almost night, and consequently he\r\ncould not try her sailing qualities that day; and he was so impatient\r\nto discover whether or not he had made a failure, that it seemed\r\nimpossible for him to wait.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus engaged, he heard the splashing of oars, and,\r\nlooking up, discovered two boys rowing toward him in a light skiff As\r\nthey approached, he recognized George and Harry Butler, two of his\r\nmost intimate acquaintances. They were brothers, and lived about a\r\nquarter of a mile from Mrs. Nelson's, but they and Frank were together\r\nalmost all the time. Harry, who was about a year older than Frank, was\r\na very impulsive fellow, and in a moment of excitement often said and\r\ndid things for which he felt sorry when he had time to think the\r\nmatter over; but he was generous and good-hearted, and if he found\r\nthat he had wronged any one, he never failed to make ample reparation.\r\nGeorge, who was just Frank's age, was a jolly, good-natured boy, and\r\nwould suffer almost any indignity rather than retaliate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank,\" said Harry, as soon as they came within speaking\r\ndistance, \"George and I wanted a little exercise, so we thought we\r\nwould row up and see what had become of you. Why don't you come down\r\nand see a fellow? Hallo!\" he exclaimed, on noticing the change in the\r\nSpeedwell's appearance, \"what have you been trying to do with your old\r\nscow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see?\" said Frank. \"I've been trying to make a yacht\r\nout of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does she sail?\" inquired George.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I have just finished her, and have not had time to try\r\nher sailing qualities yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe she will sail worth a row of pins,\" said Harry,\r\nconfidently, as he drew the skiff alongside the Speedwell, and climbed\r\nover into her. \"But I'll tell you what it is,\" he continued, peeping\r\ninto the lockers and examining the rigging, \"you must have had plenty\r\nof hard work to do in fixing her over. You have really made a nice\r\nboat out of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I call it a first-rate job,\" said George. \"Did you make the\r\nsails yourself, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank. \"I did all the work on her. She ought to be a\r\ngood sailer, after all the trouble I've had. How would you like to\r\nspend an hour with me on the river to-morrow? You will then have an\r\nopportunity to judge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys readily agreed to this proposal, and, after a few moments'\r\nmore conversation, they got into their skiff and pulled down the\r\ncreek. The next morning, about four o'clock, Frank awoke, and he had\r\nhardly opened his eyes before he was out on the floor and dressing. He\r\nalways rose at this hour, both summer and winter; and he had been so\r\nlong in the habit of it, that it had become a kind of second nature\r\nwith him. Going to the window, he drew aside the curtain and looked\r\nout. The Speedwell rode safely at the wharf, gallantly mounting the\r\nswells which were raised by quite a stiff breeze that was blowing\r\ndirectly down the creek. He amused himself for about two hours in his\r\nshop; and after he had eaten his breakfast, he began to get ready to\r\nstart on the proposed excursion. A large basket, filled with\r\nrefreshments, was carefully stowed away in one of the lockers of the\r\nSpeedwell, the sails were hoisted, the painter was cast off, and Frank\r\ntook his seat at the helm, and the boat moved from the shore \"like a\r\nthing of life.\" The creek was too narrow to allow of much maneuvering,\r\nand Frank was obliged to forbear judging of her sailing qualities\r\nuntil he should reach the river. But, to his delight, he soon\r\ndiscovered one thing, and that was, that before the wind the Speedwell\r\nwas no mean sailer. A few moments' run brought him to Mr. Butler's\r\nwharf, where he found George and Harry waiting for him. Frank brought\r\nthe Speedwell around close to the place where they were standing in\r\nsplendid style, and the boys could not refrain from expressing their\r\nadmiration at the handsome manner in which she obeyed her helm. They\r\nclambered down into the boat, and seated themselves on the middle\r\nthwarts, where they could assist Frank in managing the sails, and in a\r\nfew moments they reached the river.\r\n\r\n\"There comes Bill Johnson!\" exclaimed George, suddenly, \"just behind\r\nthe Long Dock.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked in the direction indicated, and saw the top of the\r\nmasts and sails of a boat which was moving slowly along on the other\r\nside of the dock.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank,\" said Harry, \"turn out toward the middle of the river,\r\nand get as far ahead of him as you can, and see if we can't reach the\r\nisland [meaning Strawberry Island] before he does.\"\r\n\r\nFrank accordingly turned the Speedwell's head toward the island, and\r\njust at that moment the sail-boat came in sight. The Champion--for\r\nthat was her name--was classed among the swiftest sailers about\r\nLawrence; in fact, there was no sloop that could beat her. She was a\r\nclinker-built boat, about seventeen feet long, and her breadth of\r\nbeam--that is, the distance across her from one side to the other--was\r\ngreat compared with her length. She was rigged like Frank's boat,\r\nhaving one mast and carrying a mainsail and jib; but as her sails were\r\nconsiderably larger than those of the Speedwell, and as she was a much\r\nlighter boat, the boys all expected that she would reach the island,\r\nwhich the young skippers always regarded as \"home\" in their races,\r\nlong before the Speedwell. The Champion was sailed by two boys.\r\nWilliam Johnson, her owner, sat in the stern steering, and Ben. Lake,\r\na quiet, odd sort of a boy, sat on one of the middle thwarts managing\r\nthe sails. As soon as she rounded the lock, Harry Butler sprang to his\r\nfeet, and, seizing a small coil of rope that lay in the boat, called\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\"Bill! if you will catch this line, we'll tow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you,\" answered William. \"I think we can get along very\r\nwell without any of your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" chimed in Ben. Lake, \"and we'll catch you before you are\r\nhalf-way to the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" shouted George, in reply.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Speedwell was fairly before the wind, the sails were\r\nhauled taut, the boys seated themselves on the windward gunwale, and\r\nthe race began in earnest. But they soon found that it would be much\r\nlonger than they had imagined. Instead of the slow, straining motion\r\nwhich they had expected, the Speedwell flew through the water like a\r\nduck, mounting every little swell in fine style, and rolling the foam\r\nback from her bow in great masses. She was, beyond a doubt, a fast\r\nsailer.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry shouted and hurrahed until they were hoarse, and\r\nFrank was so overjoyed that he could scarcely speak.\r\n\r\n\"How she sails!\" exclaimed Harry. \"If the Champion beats this, she\r\nwill have to go faster than she does now.\"\r\n\r\nTheir pursuers were evidently much surprised at this sudden exhibition\r\nof the Speedwell's \"sailing qualities;\" and William hauled more to the\r\nwind and \"crowded\" his boat until she stood almost on her side, and\r\nthe waves frequently washed into her.\r\n\r\n\"They will overtake us,\" said Frank, at length; \"but I guess we can\r\nkeep ahead of them until we cross the river.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved. The Champion began to gain--it was very slowly, but\r\nstill she did gain--and when the Speedwell had accomplished half the\r\ndistance across the river, their pursuers were not more than three or\r\nfour rods behind.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the island, and, as they rounded the point,\r\nthey came to a spot where the wind was broken by the trees. The\r\nSpeedwell gradually slackened her headway, and the Champion, which\r\ncould sail much faster than she before a light breeze, gained rapidly,\r\nand soon came alongside.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one fault with your boat, Frank,\" said William; \"her\r\nsails are too small. She can carry twice as much canvas as you have\r\ngot on her now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, \"I find that I have made a mistake; but the\r\nfact is, I did not know how she would behave, and was afraid she would\r\ncapsize. My first hard work shall be to make some new sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"You showed us a clean pair of heels, any way,\" said Ben. Lake,\r\nclambering over into the Speedwell. \"Why, how nice and handy every\r\nthing is! Every rope is just where you can lay your hand on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go ashore and see how we are off for a crop of strawberries,\"\r\nsaid Harry.\r\n\r\nWilliam had pulled down his sails when he came alongside, and while\r\nthe conversation was going on the Speedwell had been towing the\r\nChampion toward the island, and, just as Harry spoke, their bows ran\r\nhigh upon the sand. The boys sprang out, and spent two hours in\r\nroaming over the island in search of strawberries; but it was a little\r\ntoo early in the season for them, and, although there were \"oceans\" of\r\ngreen ones, they gathered hardly a pint of ripe ones.\r\n\r\nAfter they had eaten the refreshments which Frank had brought with\r\nhim, they started for home. As the wind blew from the main shore, they\r\nwere obliged to \"tack,\" and the Speedwell again showed some fine\r\nsailing, and when the Champion entered the creek, she was not a\r\nstone's throw behind.\r\n\r\nFrank reached home that night a good deal elated at his success. After\r\ntying the Speedwell to the wharf, he pulled down the sails and carried\r\nthem into his shop. He had promised, before leaving George and Harry,\r\nto meet them at five o'clock the next morning to start on a fishing\r\nexcursion, and, consequently, could do nothing toward the new sails\r\nfor his boat for two days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA Fishing Excursion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecisely at the time agreed upon, Frank might have been seen sitting\r\non the wharf in front of Mr. Butler's house. In his hand he carried a\r\nstout, jointed fish-pole, neatly stowed away in a strong bag of\r\ndrilling, and under his left arm hung his fish-basket, suspended by a\r\nbroad belt, which crossed his breast. In this he carried his hooks,\r\nreels, trolling-lines, dinner, and other things necessary for the\r\ntrip. Brave stood quietly by his side, patiently waiting for the word\r\nto start. They were not obliged to wait long, for hasty steps sounded\r\non the gravel walk that led up to the house, the gate swung open, and\r\nGeorge and Harry appeared, their arms filled with their\r\nfishing-tackle.\r\n\r\n\"You're on time, I see,\" said Harry, as he climbed down into a large\r\nskiff that was tied to the wharf, \"Give us your fish-pole.\"\r\n\r\nFrank accordingly handed his pole and basket down to Harry, who stowed\r\nthem away in the boat. He and George then went into the boat-house,\r\nand one brought out a pair of oars and a sail, which they intended to\r\nuse if the wind should be fair, and the other carried two pails of\r\nminnows, which had been caught the night before, to serve as bait.\r\n\r\nThey then got into the boat, and Frank took one oar and Harry the\r\nother, and Brave stationed himself at his usual place in the bow.\r\nGeorge took the helm, and they began to move swiftly down the creek\r\ntoward the river. About a quarter of a mile below the mouth of the\r\ncreek was a place, covering half an acre, where the water was about\r\nfour feet deep, and the bottom was covered with smooth, flat stones.\r\nThis was known as the \"black-bass ground,\" and large numbers of these\r\nfish were caught there every season. George turned the boat's head\r\ntoward this place, and, thrusting his hand into his pocket, drew out a\r\n\"trolling-line,\" and, dropping the hook into the water behind the\r\nboat, began to unwind the line. The trolling-hook (such as is\r\ngenerally used in fishing for black-bass) can be used only in a strong\r\ncurrent, or when the boat is in rapid motion through the water. The\r\nhook is concealed by feathers or a strip of red flannel, and a piece\r\nof shining metal in the shape of a spoon-bowl is fastened to it in\r\nsuch a manner as to revolve around it when the hook is drawn rapidly\r\nthrough the water. This is fastened to the end of a long, stout line,\r\nand trailed over the stern of the boat, whose motion keeps it near the\r\nsurface. It can be seen for a great distance in the water, and the\r\nfish, mistaking it for their prey, dart forward and seize it.\r\n\r\nA few moments' pulling brought them to the bass ground, and George,\r\nholding the stick on which the line had been wound in his hand, waited\r\nimpatiently for a \"bite.\" They had hardly entered the ground when\r\nseveral heavy pulls at the line announced that the bait had been\r\ntaken. George jerked in return, and, springing to his feet, commenced\r\nhauling in the line hand over hand, while whatever was at the other\r\nend jerked and pulled in a way that showed that he was unwilling to\r\napproach the surface. The boys ceased rowing, and Frank exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"You've got a big one there, George. Don't give him any slack, or\r\nyou'll lose him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haul in lively,\" chimed in Harry. \"There he breaches!\" he continued,\r\nas the fish--a fine bass, weighing, as near as they could guess, six\r\npounds--leaped entirely out of the water in his mad efforts to escape.\r\n\"I tell you he's a beauty.\"\r\n\r\nFrank took up the \"dip-net,\" which the boys had used in catching the\r\nminnows, and, standing by George's side, waited for him to bring the\r\nfish within reach, so that he might assist in \"landing\" him. The\r\nstruggle was exciting, but short. The bass was very soon exhausted,\r\nand George drew him alongside the boat, in which he was soon safely\r\ndeposited under one of the seats.\r\n\r\nThey rowed around the ground for half an hour, each taking his turn at\r\nthe line, and during that time they captured a dozen fish. The bass\r\nthen began to stop biting; and Frank, who was at the helm, turned the\r\nboat toward the \"perch-bed,\" which was some distance further down the\r\nriver. It was situated at the outer edge of a bank of weeds, which\r\nlined the river on both sides. The weeds sprouted from the bottom in\r\nthe spring, and by fall they reached the hight of four or five feet\r\nabove the surface of the water. They were then literally swarming with\r\nwild ducks; but at the time of which we write, as it was only the\r\nlatter part of June, they had not yet appeared above the water. The\r\nperch-bed was soon reached, and Harry, who was pulling the bow-oar,\r\nrose to his feet, and, raising the anchor, which was a large stone\r\nfastened to the boat by a long, stout rope, lifted it over the side,\r\nand let it down carefully into the water. The boat swung around until\r\nher bow pointed up stream, and the boys found themselves in the right\r\nspot to enjoy a good day's sport.\r\n\r\nFrank, who was always foremost in such matters, had his pole rigged\r\nin a trice, and, baiting his hook with one of the minnows, dropped it\r\ninto the water just outside of the weeds. Half a dozen hungry perch\r\ninstantly rose to the surface, and one of them, weighing nearly a\r\npound, seized the bait and darted off with it, and the next moment was\r\ndangling through the air toward the boat.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good-sized fish,\" said Harry, as he fastened his reel on his\r\npole.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, taking his prize off the hook and throwing it\r\ninto the boat; \"and we shall have fine sport for a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they will stop biting when the sun gets a little warmer; so we\r\nhad better make the most of our time,\" observed George.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other boys had rigged their poles, and soon two more\r\nlarge perch lay floundering in the boat. For almost two hours they\r\nenjoyed fine sport, as Frank had said they would, and they were too\r\nmuch engaged to think of being hungry. But soon the fish began to stop\r\nbiting, and Harry, who had waited impatiently for almost five minutes\r\nfor a \"nibble,\" drew up his line and opened a locker in the stern of\r\nthe boat, and, taking out a basket containing their dinner, was about\r\nto make an inroad on its contents, when he discovered a boat, rowed by\r\na boy about his own age, shoot rapidly around a point that extended\r\nfor a considerable distance out into the river, and turn toward the\r\nspot where they were anchored.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" he exclaimed, \"here comes Charley Morgan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Charley Morgan,\" repeated Frank. \"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he is the new-comer,\" answered George. \"He lives in the large\r\nbrick house on the hill.\"\r\n\r\nCharley Morgan had formerly lived in New York. His father was a\r\nspeculator, and was looked upon by some as a wealthy man; but it was\r\nhinted by those who knew him best that if his debts were all paid he\r\nwould have but little ready money left. Be that as it may, Mr. Morgan\r\nand his family, at any rate, lived in style, and seemed desirous of\r\noutshining all their neighbors and acquaintances. Becoming weary of\r\ncity life, they had decided to move into the country, and, purchasing\r\na fine village lot in Lawrence, commenced building a house upon it.\r\nAlthough the village could boast of many fine dwellings, the one on\r\nTower Hill, owned by Mr. Morgan, surpassed them all, and, as is always\r\nthe case in such places, every one was eager to discover who was to\r\noccupy the elegant mansion. When the house was completed, Mr. Morgan\r\nreturned to New York to bring on his family, leaving three or four\r\n\"servants,\" as he called them, to look after his affairs; and the\r\nJulia Burton landed at the wharf, one pleasant morning, a splendid\r\nopen carriage, drawn by a span of jet-black horses. The carriage\r\ncontained Mr. Morgan and his family, consisting of his wife and one\r\nson--the latter about seventeen years old. At the time of his\r\nintroduction to the reader they had been in the village about a week.\r\nCharles, by his haughty, overbearing manner, had already driven away\r\nfrom him the most sensible of the village boys who had become\r\nacquainted with him; but there are those every-where who seem, by some\r\nstrange fatality, to choose the most unworthy of their acquaintances\r\nfor their associates; and there were several boys in Lawrence who\r\nlooked upon Charles as a first-rate fellow and a very desirable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry, although they had frequently seen the \"new-comer,\"\r\nhad not had an opportunity to get acquainted with him; and Frank who,\r\nas we have said, lived in the outskirts of the village, and who had\r\nbeen very busy at work for the last week on his boat, had not seen him\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a boy is he?\" inquired the latter, continuing the\r\nconversation which we have so unceremoniously broken off.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Harry. \"Some of the boys like him, but Ben.\r\nLake says he's the biggest rascal in the village. He's got two or\r\nthree guns, half a dozen fish-poles, and, by what I hear the boys\r\nsay, he must be a capital sportsman. But he tells the most ridiculous\r\nstories about what he has done.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Charles had almost reached them, and, when he came\r\nalongside, he rested on his oars and called out,\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys, how many fish have you caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"So many,\" answered George, holding up the string, which contained\r\nover a hundred perch and black-bass. \"Have you caught any thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much to brag of,\" answered Charles; \"I hooked up a few little\r\nperch just behind the point. But that is a tip-top string of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, pretty fair,\" answered Harry. \"You see we know where to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does make some difference,\" said Charles. \"But as soon as I know\r\nthe good places, I'll show you how to catch fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will show you the good fishing-grounds any time,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't want any of your help. I can tell by the looks of a place\r\nwhether there are any fish to be caught or not. But you ought to see\r\nthe fishing-grounds we have in New York,\" he continued. \"Why, many a\r\ntime I've caught three hundred in less than half an hour, and some of\r\nthem would weigh ten pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you catch them with a hook and line?\" inquired George.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I did! What else should I catch them with? I should like to\r\nsee one of you trying to handle a ten or fifteen-pound fish with\r\nnothing but a trout-pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you do it?\" inquired Harry, struggling hard to suppress a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Do it? I _have_ done it many a time. But is there any hunting around\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Charles, \"I walked all over the woods this morning,\r\nand couldn't find any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the season for hunting now,\" said George; \"but in the fall\r\nthere are lots of ducks, pigeons, squirrels, and turkeys, and in the\r\nwinter the woods are full of minks, and now and then a bear or deer;\r\nand the swamps are just the places to kill muskrats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd just like to go hunting with some of you. I'll bet I can kill\r\nmore game in a day than any one in the village.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys made no reply to this confident assertion, for the fact was\r\nthat they were too full of laughter to trust themselves to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you haven't got any thing in the village that can come up to\r\nthis,\" continued Charles; and as he spoke he raised a light,\r\nbeautifully-finished rifle from the bottom of the boat, and held it up\r\nto the admiring gaze of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"That is a beauty,\" said Harry, who wished to continue the\r\nconversation as long as possible, in order to hear some more of\r\nCharles's \"large stories.\" \"How far will it shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"It cost me a hundred dollars,\" answered Charles, \"and I've killed\r\nbears and deer with it, many a time, as far as across this river\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nCharles did not hesitate to say this, for he was talking only to\r\n\"simple-minded country boys,\" as he called them, and he supposed he\r\ncould say what he pleased and they would believe it. His auditors, who\r\nbefore had been hardly able to contain themselves, were now almost\r\nbursting with laughter. Frank and George, however, managed to draw on\r\na sober face, while Harry turned away his head and stuffed his\r\nhandkerchief into his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" continued Charles, not noticing the condition his\r\nhearers were in, \"I've seen some pretty tough times in my life. Once,\r\nwhen I was hunting in the Adirondack Mountains, in the northern part\r\nof Michigan, I was attacked by Indians, and came very near being\r\ncaptured, and the way I fought was a caution to white folks. This\r\nlittle rifle came handy then, I tell you. But I must hurry along now;\r\nI promised to go riding with the old man this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he dipped the oars into the water, and the little boat shot\r\nrapidly up the river. It was well that he took his departure just as\r\nhe did, for our three boys could not possibly have contained\r\nthemselves a moment longer. They could not wait for him to get out of\r\nsight, but, lying back in the boat, they laughed until the tears\r\nrolled down their cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank, what do you think of him?\" inquired Harry, as soon as he\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n\"I think the less we have to do with him the better,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"I did think,\" said Harry, stopping now and then to indulge in a\r\nhearty fit of laughter, \"that there might be some good things about\r\nhim; but a boy that can tell such whopping big lies as he told must be\r\nvery small potatoes. Only think of catching three hundred fish in less\r\nthan half an hour, and with only one hook and line! Why, that would be\r\nten every minute, and that is as many as two men could manage. And\r\nthen for him to talk about that pop-gun of his shooting as far as\r\nacross this river!--why, it's a mile and a half--and I know it\r\nwouldn't shoot forty rods, and kill. But the best of all was his\r\nhunting among the Adirondack Mountains, in Michigan, and having to\r\ndefend himself against the Indians; that's a good joke.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harry laid back in the boat again, and laughed and shouted until\r\nhis sides ached.\r\n\r\n\"He must be a very ungrateful fellow,\" said Frank, at length. \"Didn't\r\nyou notice how disrespectfully he spoke of his father? He called him\r\nhis 'old man.' If I had a father, I'd never speak so lightly of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I noticed that,\" said George. \"But,\" he continued, reaching for\r\nthe basket which Harry, after helping himself most bountifully, had\r\nplaced on the middle seat, \"I'm hungry as blazes, and think I can do\r\njustice to the good things mother has put up for us.\"\r\n\r\nAfter eating their dinner they got out their fishing-tackle again; but\r\nthe perch had stopped biting, and, after waiting patiently for half an\r\nhour without feeling a nibble, they unjointed their poles, drew up the\r\nanchor, and Frank seated himself at the helm, while George and Harry\r\ntook the oars and pulled toward home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Regulators\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the range of hills which extended around the western side of\r\nthe village was occupied by several families, known as the \"Hillers.\"\r\nThey were ignorant, degraded people, living in miserable hovels, and\r\nobtaining a precarious subsistence by hunting, fishing, and stealing.\r\nWith them the villagers rarely, if ever, had intercourse, and\r\nrespectable persons seldom crossed their thresholds. The principal man\r\namong the Hillers was known as Bill Powell. He was a giant in strength\r\nand stature, and used to boast that he could visit \"any hen-roost in\r\nthe village every night in the week, and carry off a dozen chickens\r\neach time, without being nabbed.\" He was very fond of liquor, too\r\nindolent to work, and spent most of his time, when out of jail, on the\r\nriver, fishing, or roaming through the woods with his gun. He had one\r\nson, whose name was Lee, and a smarter boy it was hard to find. He\r\npossessed many good traits of character, but, as they had never been\r\ndeveloped, it was difficult to discover them. He had always lived in\r\nthe midst of evil influences, led by the example of a drunken, brutal\r\nfather, and surrounded by wicked companions, and it is no wonder that\r\nhis youthful aspirations were in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nLee and his associates, as they were not obliged so attend school, and\r\nwere under no parental control, always amused themselves as they saw\r\nit. Most of their time was spent on the river or in the woods, and,\r\nwhen weary of this sport, the orchards and melon-patches around the\r\nvillage, although closely guarded, were sure to suffer at their hands;\r\nand they planned and executed their plundering expeditions with so\r\nmuch skill and cunning, that they were rarely detected.\r\n\r\nA day or two after the events related in the preceding chapter\r\ntranspired, Charles Morgan, in company with two or three of his chosen\r\ncompanions, was enjoying a sail on the river. During their\r\nconversation, one of the boys chanced to say something about the\r\nHillers, and Charles inquired who they were. His companions gave him\r\nthe desired information, and ended by denouncing them in the strongest\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nCharles, after hearing them through, exclaimed, \"I'd just like to\r\ncatch one of those boys robbing our orchard or hen-roost. One or the\r\nof us would get a pummeling, sure as shooting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said one of the boys, \"but, you see, they do not go alone. If\r\nthey did, it would be an easy matter to catch them. But they all go\r\ntogether, and half of them keep watch, and the rest bag the plunder;\r\nand they move around so still that even the dogs don't hear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you fellows here in the village would take the matter\r\ninto your own hands,\" said Charles.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you club together, and every time you see one of the\r\nHillers, go to work and thrash him like blazes? I guess, after you had\r\nhalf-killed two or three of them, they would learn to let things\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess they would, too,\" said one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we get up a company of fifteen or twenty fellows,\" resumed\r\nCharles, \"and see how it works. I'll bet my eyes that, after we've\r\nwhipped half a dozen of them, they won't dare to show their faces in\r\nthe village again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to do it,\" said one of the boys. \"I'll join the\r\ncompany, for one.\"\r\n\r\nThe others readily fell in with Charles's proposal, and they spent\r\nsome time talking it over and telling what they intended to do when\r\nthey could catch the Hillers, when one of the boys suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"I think, after all, that we shall have some trouble in carrying out\r\nour plans. Although there are plenty of fellows in the village who\r\nwould be glad to join the company, there are some who must not know\r\nany thing about it, or the fat will all be in the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\" demanded Charles.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there are Frank Nelson, and George and Harry Butler, and Bill\r\nJohnson, and a dozen others, who could knock the whole thing into a\r\ncocked hat, in less than no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could they? I'd just like to see them try it on,\" said Charles, with\r\na confident air. \"They would have a nice time of it. How would they go\r\nto work?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that, if they saw us going to whip the Hillers, they\r\nwould interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would, eh? I'd like to see them undertake to hinder us. Can't\r\ntwenty fellows whip a dozen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Every one calls Frank Nelson and his set the best boys\r\nin the village. They never fight if they can help it; but they are\r\nplaguy smart fellows, I tell you; and, if we once get them aroused, we\r\nshall have a warm time of it, I remember a little circumstance that\r\nhappened last winter. We had a fort in the field behind the\r\nschool-house, and one night we were out there, snowballing, and I saw\r\nFrank Nelson handle two of the largest boys in his class. There were\r\nabout a dozen boys in the fort--and they were the ones that always go\r\nwith Frank--and all the rest of the school were against them. The fort\r\nstood on a little hill, and we were almost half an hour capturing it,\r\nand we wouldn't ever have taken it if the wall hadn't been broken\r\ndown. We would get almost up to the fort, and they would rush out and\r\ndrive us down again. At last we succeeded in getting to the top of the\r\nhill, and our boys began to tumble over the walls, and I hope I may be\r\nshot if they didn't throw us out as fast as we could get in, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't care any thing about that,\" interrupted Charles, who\r\ncould not bear to hear any one but himself praised. \"If I had been\r\nthere, I would have run up and thrown _them_ out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you could have done it easy enough,\" said one of the boys, who\r\nhad for some time remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"Frank Nelson and his set are not such great fellows, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they ain't,\" said the other. \"They feel big enough; but I\r\nguess, if we get this company we have spoken of started, and they\r\nundertake to interfere with us, we will take them down a peg or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the talk!\" said Charles. \"I never let any one stop me when I\r\nhave once made up my mind to do a thing. I would as soon knock Frank\r\nNelson down as any body else.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the boat, which had been headed toward the shore, entered\r\nthe creek, and Charles drew up to the wharf, and, after setting his\r\ncompanions ashore, and directing them to speak to every one whom they\r\nthought would be willing to join the company, and to no one else, he\r\ndrew down the sails, and pulled up the creek toward the place where he\r\nkept his boat.\r\n\r\nA week passed, and things went on swimmingly. Thirty boys had enrolled\r\nthemselves as members of the Regulators, as the company was called,\r\nand Charles, who had been chosen captain, had carried out his plans so\r\nquietly, that he was confident that no one outside of the company knew\r\nof its existence. Their arrangements had all been completed, and the\r\nRegulators waited only for a favorable opportunity to carry their\r\nplans into execution.\r\n\r\nFrank, during this time, had remained at home, working in his garden\r\nor shop, and knew nothing of what was going on.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he wrote a letter to his cousin Archie, and, after\r\nsupper, set out, with Brave at his heels, to carry it to the\r\npost-office. He stopped on the way for George and Harry Butler, who\r\nwere always ready to accompany him. On the steps of the post-office\r\nthey met three or four of their companions, and, after a few moments'\r\nconversation, William Johnson suddenly inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Have you joined the new society, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"What society?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the Regulators.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess they have managed to keep it pretty quiet,\" said\r\nWilliam. \"They don't want any outsiders to know any thing about it.\r\nThey asked me to join in with them, but I told them that they ought to\r\nknow better than to propose such a thing to me. Then they tried to\r\nmake me promise that I wouldn't say any thing about it, but I would\r\nmake no such promise, for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bill, what are you talking about?\" inquired Harry. \"You rattle\r\nit off as if we knew all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you heard any thing about it, either?\" inquired William, in\r\nsurprise. \"I was certain that they would ask you to join. Well, the\r\namount of it is that Charley Morgan and a lot of his particular\r\nfriends have been organizing a company for the purpose of thrashing\r\nthe Hillers, and making them stop robbing hen-roosts and orchards and\r\ncutting up such shines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" chimed in James Porter, \"there are about thirty of them, and\r\nthey say that they are going to whip the Hillers out of the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's news to me,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Thomas Benton, \"I, of course, know that the\r\nHillers ought to be punished; but I do not think it is the duty of us\r\nboys to take the law into our own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said James Porter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, _I_ do,\" said Harry, who, as we have said, was an impetuous,\r\nfiery fellow, \"and I believe I will join the Regulators, and help whip\r\nthe rascals out of the country. They ought, every one of them, to be\r\nthrashed for stealing and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here, Harry,\" interrupted George. \"You know very well that\r\nsuch a plan will never succeed, and it _ought_ not to. You have been\r\ntaught that it is wrong to take things that do not belong to you, but\r\nwith the Hillers the case is different; their parents teach them to\r\nsteal, and they are obliged to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Frank, \"this summary method of correcting them will\r\nnot break up their bad habits; kindness will accomplish much more than\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindness!\" repeated Harry, sneeringly; \"as if kindness could have any\r\neffect on a Hiller!\"\r\n\r\n\"They can tell when they are kindly treated as well as any one else,\"\r\nsaid George.\r\n\r\n\"And another thing,\" said Ben. Lake; \"these Regulators must be a\r\nfoolish set of fellows to suppose that the Hillers are going to stand\r\nstill and be whipped. I say, as an old sea-captain once said, when it\r\nwas proposed to take a man-o'-war with a whale-boat, 'I guess it will\r\nbe a puttering job.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said James, \"I shall do all I can to prevent a fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"So will I,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ won't,\" said Harry, who, with his arms buried almost to the\r\nelbows in his pockets, was striding backward and forward across the\r\nsteps. \"I say the Hillers ought to be thrashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said William, without noticing what Harry had remarked,\r\n\"that our interference will be the surest way to bring on a fight;\r\nbecause, after I refused to join the company, they told me that if any\r\nof us attempted to defend the Hillers, or break up the company, they\r\nwould thrash us, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to break up their company,\" said Frank, with a laugh.\r\n\"We must have a talk with them, and try to show them how unreasonable\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they come, now,\" said George, pointing up the road.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked in the direction indicated, and saw the Regulators\r\njust turning the corner of the street that led to Mr. Morgan's house.\r\nThey came around in fine order, marching four abreast, and turned up\r\nthe street that led to the post-office. They had evidently been well\r\ndrilled, for they kept step admirably.\r\n\r\n\"They look nice, don't they?\" said Ben.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered George; \"and if they were enlisted in a good cause, I\r\nwould off with my hat and give them three cheers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Regulators had almost reached the post-office, when they suddenly\r\nset up a loud shout, and, breaking ranks, started on a full run down\r\nthe street. The boys saw the reason for this, when they discovered Lee\r\nPowell coming up the road that led from the river, with a large string\r\nof fish in his hand. He always had good luck, but he seemed to have\r\nbeen more fortunate than usual, for his load was about as heavy as he\r\ncould conveniently carry. He walked rapidly along, evidently very much\r\noccupied with his own thoughts, when, suddenly, two or three stones\r\ncame skipping over the ground, and aroused him from his reverie. He\r\nlooked up in surprise, and discovered that his enemies were so close\r\nto him that flight was useless.\r\n\r\nThe Regulators drew nearer and nearer, and the stones fell thick about\r\nthe object of their wrath, until, finally, one struck him on the\r\nshoulder, and another knocked his cap from his head.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand that,\" said Frank; and, springing from the steps, he\r\nstarted to the rescue, followed by all of his companions, (except\r\nHarry, who still paced the steps), and they succeeded in throwing\r\nthemselves between Lee and his assailants.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Regulators faltered on seeing Lee thus defended; but\r\nCharles, followed by half a dozen of his \"right-hand men,\" advanced,\r\nand attempted to force his way between Frank and his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, here!\" said Frank, as he gently, but firmly, resisted\r\nCharles's attempts to push him aside. \"What are you trying to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What business is that of yours?\" answered Charles, roughly, as he\r\ncontinued his efforts to reach Lee. \"You question me as if you were my\r\nmaster. Stand aside, if you don't want to get yourself in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't intend to hurt Lee, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. But it's none of your business, any way. Get out of the\r\nway!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he ever done you any harm?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's none of your business, I say!\" shouted Charles, now almost\r\nbeside himself with rage.\r\n\r\n\"And I want you to keep your hands off me!\" he continued, as Frank\r\nseized his arm, which he had raised to strike Lee, who stood close\r\nbehind his protector.\r\n\r\nFrank released his hold, and Charles sprang forward again, and,\r\ndodging Frank's grasp, slipped under his arm, and attempted to seize\r\nthe Hiller. But Frank was as quick as a cat in his motions; and,\r\nbefore Charles had time to strike a blow, he seized him with a grip\r\nthat brought from him a cry of pain, and seated him, unceremoniously,\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Charles could regain his feet, he called out,\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, boys--just as I expected! Never mind the Hiller, but\r\nlet's go to work and give the other fellows a thrashing that they\r\nwon't get over in a month.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sprang toward Frank, against whom he seemed to cherish an\r\nespecial grudge, followed by a dozen Regulators, who brandished their\r\nfists as if they intended to annihilate Lee's gallant defenders. But,\r\njust as Charles was about to attack Frank, a new actor appeared. Harry\r\nButler, who had greatly changed his mind in regard to \"thrashing the\r\nHillers,\" seeing that the attack was about to be renewed, sprang down\r\nthe steps, and caught Charles in his arms, and threw him to the\r\nground, like a log.\r\n\r\nThe others had been no less successful in repulsing their assailants;\r\nand, when Charles rose to his feet, he saw three or four of the\r\nRegulators, who had followed him to the attack, sprawling on the\r\nground, and the rest retreating precipitately.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Harry, \"let's stop this. We've had enough of it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Charles, and several more of the Regulators, seemed to be of a\r\ndifferent opinion, and were about to recommence their hostile\r\ndemonstrations, when Harry continued,\r\n\r\n\"We've only been playing with you so far Charley; so you had better\r\nnot try to come any more of your Regulator tricks on us. We don't want\r\nto fight, but we shall defend ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had attended to your own affairs, you would not have been\r\nobliged to defend yourselves,\" said Charles, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of fellows do you suppose we are?\" said Harry. \"If you\r\nexpected us to stand still and see thirty fellows pitch on one, you\r\nare very much mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Lee,\" said Frank, taking the former by the arm, \"I guess we can\r\ngo now. We'll see you out of harm's way.\"\r\n\r\nThe crest-fallen Regulators divided right and left, and allowed Frank\r\nand his companions to depart, unmolested. They accompanied Lee almost\r\nto the miserable hovel he called \"home,\" and, when about to bid him\r\ngood-night, he said, with some feeling,\r\n\r\n\"I'll remember you, boys; and, if it ever comes handy, you will find\r\nthat Lee Powell has got feelings, as well as any one else.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sprang over a fence, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Frank and his companions were accompanying Lee toward home, some\r\nof the Regulators were indulging in feelings of the deepest malice;\r\nand there were about a dozen of them--Frank's old enemies--who\r\ndetermined that he should not go unpunished. But there were others who\r\nbegan to see how cowardly they had acted in attacking a defenseless\r\nboy, for the only reason that he was a bad boy, and to fear that they\r\nhad lost the good-will of Frank and his associates. The village boys,\r\nwith a few exceptions, were accustomed to look up to Frank as a sort\r\nof leader; not that he aspired to the position, but his generosity,\r\nand the easy way he had of settling the disputes that sometimes arose\r\namong the boys, had won for him many a fast friend. We have seen,\r\nhowever, that he was not beloved by all; every good boy has his\r\nenemies, and Frank, of course, had his share of them. They were boys\r\nwho were jealous of him, and hated him because he held a position in\r\nthe estimation of the village people to which they could not attain.\r\nBut this class was very small, comprising, as we have said, about a\r\ndozen of the Regulators; and, while they were enraged at their defeat,\r\nand studying plans for revenge, the others were repenting of their\r\nfolly, and trying to think of some way by which they might regain\r\ntheir lost reputation.\r\n\r\nCharles's overbearing and haughty manner was so different from Frank's\r\nkind, obliging ways, that they had already grown tired of his company,\r\nand began to think seriously of having nothing more to do with him;\r\nand the things that had just transpired served to convince them that\r\nthe sooner they left him the better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lee and his gallant defenders had disappeared, one of the\r\nRegulators remarked,\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys, I don't call this a paying business, trying to thrash a\r\nboy who has done us no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my opinion,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"And I, for one, wish I had kept out of this scrape,\" said a third.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said the one who had first spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you begin to back down, do you, you cowards?\" exclaimed Charles,\r\nwho was taken completely by surprise by this sudden change of\r\naffairs. \"_I_ never give up till I am whipped. If it hadn't been for\r\nmy lame hand, I would have knocked some of those fellows into cocked\r\nhats. I'll fix that Frank Nelson, the next time I catch him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you do it to-night?\" inquired one of the boys, sneeringly.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a lame hand, I tell you,\" roared the bully; \"and I don't\r\nwant you to speak to me in that way again; if you do, you and I will\r\nhave a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be an unpleasant job for you, to say the least,\" said one\r\nof the boys; \"the most of us are heartily sick of your company, and we\r\nhave been talking, for two or three days, of sending in our\r\nresignations. Now, boys,\" he continued, \"this is as good an\r\nopportunity as we shall have; so those that won't have any thing more\r\nto do with Regulating, say 'I!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I! I!\" burst from a score of throats.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he resumed, turning to Charles, \"good-by; and, if you ever wish\r\nto recruit another company, you need not call on any of us.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he walked off, followed by nearly all the Regulators; those\r\nwho remained were Frank's enemies and rivals.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said Charles, as soon as the others had gone, \"there are\r\na few of us left, and we can annoy the fellows who think they are too\r\ngood to associate with us in the worst way. Let us adjourn to our\r\nbarn, where we can talk the matter over.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments' walk brought them to Mr. Morgan's house, and, when they\r\nentered the long carriage-way that led up to the barn, Charles said,\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, you stay here, and I'll go in and get a light.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran into the house, and soon reappeared with a lantern in each\r\nhand, and led the way toward the barn. He unlocked the door, and he\r\nand his companions entered; and, after allowing them time to examine,\r\nto their satisfaction, the splendid equipage that had attracted so\r\nmuch attention the morning they arrived at the village, Charles\r\nproceeded to call the meeting to order.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said he, \"we don't intend to disband, do we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered several.\r\n\r\n\"Then, the first thing for us to do is to change our name, for we\r\ndon't want to let those cowardly sneaks that deserted us to-night know\r\nany thing about us. What shall we be called?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral names were proposed, but they did not suit Charles. At length,\r\none of the boys inquired,\r\n\r\n\"What name would you like?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that 'Midnight Rangers' would be a good name for us,\"\r\nanswered Charles.\r\n\r\n\"That's a splendid name!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Charles, \"we must change our plan of operations a\r\nlittle. We must give up the idea of thrashing the Hillers for awhile,\r\nbecause there are not enough of us; but I should like it, if we could\r\ngo to work and whip every one of those fellows that stuck up for Lee\r\nPowell to-night, especially Frank Nelson.\"\r\n\r\n\"So would I,\" answered William Gage, whom Charles looked upon as his\r\n'right-hand man;' \"but it wouldn't do to attempt it, for he has got\r\ntoo many friends. We must shoot his dog, or steal his boat, or do\r\nsomething of that kind. It would plague him more than a dozen\r\nwhippings.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" exclaimed another of the Rangers. \"If we could only go up\r\nthere, some dark night, and steal his scow, and run her out into the\r\nriver, and burn her, wouldn't he be mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" chimed in another, \"but it wouldn't pay even to attempt that.\r\nHe always keeps his boats chained up, and the noise we would make in\r\ngetting them loose would be sure to start that dog of his, and then we\r\nshould have a dusty time, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so, too,\" said William Gage. \"Whatever we do, we must be\r\ncareful not to start that dog, for he would go through fire and water\r\nto catch us; and, if he ever got hold of one of us--\"\r\n\r\nAnd William shrugged his shoulders, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he got an orchard or melon-patch that we could visit?\"\r\ninquired Charles.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered one of the Rangers; \"but he's got as nice a\r\nstrawberry-patch as ever laid out-doors. But it's a little too early\r\nfor strawberries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who cares for that?\" said Charles. \"We don't go to get the fruit; we\r\nonly want to pay him for defending the Hiller--meddling with other\r\npeople's business. It's too late to do any thing to-night,\" he added,\r\nglancing at his watch, \"but let us go there to-morrow night, and pull\r\nup every strawberry-plant we can lay our hands on. You know, we can do\r\nas much mischief of that kind as we please, and it will all be laid to\r\nthe Hillers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we meet?\" inquired one of the Rangers.\r\n\r\n\"Come here at precisely seven o'clock; and, remember, don't lisp a\r\nsingle word to any one about it, for, if you do, we shall be found\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rangers were about to disperse, when one of them suddenly\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n\"Will not folks mistrust that something is in the wind, if they see us\r\nall starting up the road at that time of night?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact,\" said William Gage. \"Wouldn't it be a better plan for\r\nus to meet in the woods, at the back of Mrs. Nelson's lot? Let us all\r\nbe there at eight o'clock; and, if no two of us go in company, no one\r\nwill be the wiser for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the best plan,\" said Charles. \"Now, remember, don't say any\r\nthing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" was the answer; and, in a few moments more, the Rangers\r\nwere on their way home.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, at seven o'clock, Charles left his home, and,\r\navoiding the principal streets as much as possible, started toward the\r\nplace of rendezvous, where he arrived at almost precisely the time\r\nagreed upon. He found the Rangers all waiting for him; and, as it was\r\nalready dark, it was decided to commence operations immediately.\r\n\r\n\"We want a guide,\" said Charles, who, of course, was captain of the\r\nRangers. \"Who knows exactly where that strawberry-bed lies? for, if we\r\nhave to fumble about much, we shall start that dog, and then, it\r\nstrikes me, from what I have seen and heard of him, we shall be in a\r\npredicament.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may safely bet on that,\" said one of the boys; \"he's a savage\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a first-rate watch-dog, too,\" observed another.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Charles, \"all we have to do is to move so still that you\r\ncan't hear a leaf rustle; but, if we do rouse the dog, let each one\r\ngrab a stone and let him have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would only make a bad matter worse,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid we shall have more than we bargained for, if we undertake\r\nthat,\" remarked another.\r\n\r\n\"Let the cowards go home, and the rest come with me,\" said Charles,\r\nimpatiently. \"Bill,\" he continued, turning to his right-hand man, \"can\r\nyou act as guide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, lead on.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam led the way out of the woods, across a narrow meadow, where\r\nthey came to the fence that inclosed Mrs. Nelson's garden.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" he whispered, \"keep still as mice; but, if we do start\r\nthe dog, don't stop to fight him, but run like white-heads.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rangers climbed over the fence, and followed their guide, who\r\nthreaded his way through the trees and bushes with a skill worthy of a\r\nbetter cause, and a few moments sufficed to bring them to the\r\nstrawberry-patch.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, boys,\" said Charles, in a low whisper. \"Don't leave a\r\nsingle plant in the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe young scapegraces worked with a will, and, in a few moments, the\r\nstrawberry-bed--which was Frank's pride, next to his museum, and on\r\nwhich he had expended a great amount of labor--was almost ruined; and\r\nso quietly did they proceed in their work of wanton destruction, that\r\nBrave, although a very vigilant dog, was not aroused, and the\r\nmarauders retraced their steps, and reached the woods in safety.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Charles, at length, \"that's what I call doing it up\r\nbrown. It almost pays off my debts. I don't think they will receive\r\nmuch benefit from those strawberries this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have got some nice pears,\" said one of the Rangers, \"and when\r\nthey get ripe, we must plan another expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" answered Charles. \"But we must not forget that we have\r\nothers to settle with; and we must meet, some time next week, and\r\ndetermine who shall be visited next.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Frank arose, as usual, at four o'clock, and,\r\nshouldering his fish-pole, started off through the woods to catch a\r\nmess of trout, intending to be back by breakfast-time. But, as the\r\nmorning was cloudy, the trout bit voraciously, and in the excitement\r\nof catching them, he forgot that he was hungry, and it was almost noon\r\nbefore he reached home.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he entered the house, Aunt Hannah exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Master Frank, you were altogether too good to Lee Powell, the other\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Julia, hearing his voice, burst in from the\r\ndining-room, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"Frank, the Hillers have robbed your strawberry-patch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not robbed it, exactly,\" said his mother, who had followed close\r\nafter Julia, \"but they have completely ruined it. There are not a\r\ndozen plants left in the ground.\"\r\n\r\nFrank was so surprised that he could scarcely utter a word; and,\r\nhardly waiting to hear what his mother said, he hurried from the house\r\ntoward the strawberry-patch. It did, indeed, present a strange and\r\ndesolate appearance. The bed had covered nearly half an acre; and, so\r\nwell had the Rangers performed their work, that but few plants were\r\nleft standing. The sight was enough to upset even Frank's\r\nwell-established patience, and he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"If I had the rascals that did this mischief, I could pay them for it,\r\nwithout troubling my conscience much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must tell Lee Powell, the next time you see him,\" said Julia, who\r\nhad followed him, \"that he ought not to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lee didn't do it,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Frank, bending over a footprint in the soft earth;\r\n\"the Hillers all go bare-foot, and these fellows wore boots. I know\r\nwho did it, as well as if I had seen them. It was the work of Charles\r\nMorgan and a few of his particular friends. They must have been very\r\nstill about it, for Brave didn't hear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what object they had in doing it,\" said Julia.\r\n\r\n\"I know what they did it for,\" said Frank; \"and if I ever catch--But,\"\r\nhe added, checking himself, \"there's no use in grumbling about it; no\r\namount of fretting will repair the damage.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he led the way toward the house.\r\n\r\nIt did not take him long to don his working-suit, and, shouldering his\r\nhoe, he returned to the strawberry-bed, and, in less than an hour, the\r\nplants were all in the ground again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHow to Spend the \"Fourth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, after supper, Frank retired to his room, and, settling\r\nhimself in his comfortable armchair, was soon deeply interested in one\r\nof Bayard Taylor's works. While thus engaged, a light step was heard\r\nin the hall, and, afterward, a gentle rap at his door, and Julia came\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank,\" she began, \"I don't want you to read to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you know that day after to-morrow is the Fourth of July, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And you haven't got your fire-works yet?\" interrupted Frank.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said her brother, rising to put away his book, \"then, I\r\nsuppose, I shall have to go down to the village and get you some. What\r\ndo you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want all the things that are written down on this paper.\"\r\n\r\nFrank took the paper and read, \"Three packs of fire-crackers, four\r\nboxes of torpedoes, three Roman candles, half a dozen pin-wheels, and\r\na dozen sky-rockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" said Frank, as he folded up the paper and put it into his\r\npocket, \"that's what I should call going it strong! Well, I'll tell\r\nMr. Sheldon [the store-keeper] to send up all the fire-works he has\r\ngot.\"\r\n\r\nJulia burst into a loud laugh, and, the next moment, Frank and Brave\r\nwere out of the gate, on their way to the village.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time several of Frank's acquaintances had been amusing\r\nthemselves on the village common with a game of ball. At length it\r\ngrew too dark for their sport to continue, and one of the boys\r\nproposed that they should decide upon some pleasant way of spending\r\nthe Fourth.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the humiliating defeat which Charles Morgan and his\r\ncompanions had sustained, they were present; and the former, who had\r\nbeen making every exertion to regain the good-will of the village\r\nboys, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Let's go hunting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" shouted several.\r\n\r\n\"The game in the woods isn't good for any thing this time of year,\r\nCharley,\" said James Porter, who, although he cordially disliked\r\nCharles, always tried to treat him kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Who cares for that?\" exclaimed Charles, who, having always been\r\naccustomed to lead and govern his city associates, could not endure\r\nthe steadfastness with which these \"rude country boys,\" as he called\r\nthem, held to their own opinions. Although, during the whole\r\nafternoon, he had been endeavoring to work himself into their favor,\r\nhe was angry, in an instant, at the manner in which they opposed his\r\nproposition. He had been considerably abashed at his recent defeat,\r\nand he knew that it had humbled him in the estimation of the Rangers,\r\nwho, although they still \"held true\" to him, had changed their minds\r\nin regard to the prowess of their leader, and began to regard him, as\r\none of them remarked, as a \"mere bag of wind.\"\r\n\r\nCharles was not long in discovering this, and he determined to seize\r\nthe first opportunity that was offered to retrieve his reputation.\r\n\r\nHastily casting his eyes over the group that surrounded him, he\r\ndiscovered that Frank and Harry, the ones he most feared, were still\r\nabsent. This was exactly what he had wished for. With the assistance\r\nof his companions, the Rangers, who, he was confident, would uphold\r\nhim, he could settle up all old scores, without fear of suffering in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nAddressing himself to James, he continued, in an insulting tone,\r\n\r\n\"We don't go to get the game to _eat_, you blockhead, but only for\r\nthe sport of killing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" answered James, in a mild voice, not the least\r\ndisconcerted by the other's furious manner; \"but wouldn't it be better\r\nto--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" shouted Charles. \"I'll do just as I please. Besides, I\r\nnever allow any one to dictate to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't intend to dictate at all, Charley. I was going to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to keep still,\" roared the bully, \"or shall I make\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to advance toward James.\r\n\r\n\"See here, old fellow,\" said Ben. Lake, suddenly striding up, and\r\nplacing himself directly in front of Charles, \"don't begin another\r\nfight, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you whether I will or not!\" exclaimed Charles; and, turning\r\nto the Rangers, he continued, \"Come on, boys! We can have things all\r\nour own way now. We'll see if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" shouted William Johnson. \"Here comes Frank. Now you had\r\nbetter take yourself off in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nCharles's hostile demonstrations ceased in an instant; and, hastily\r\nwhispering a few words to the Rangers, they disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, Frank, accompanied by George and Harry, arrived,\r\nand the boys, in a few words, explained to them what had just\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Frank, \"that Charley will see, before long, how\r\nunreasonably he acts. He makes himself, and every one around him,\r\nuncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said James Porter, \"all I have got to say is that those\r\nfellows who go with him are very foolish. However, we can't help it.\r\nBut, come,\" he added, \"we were trying to find some pleasant way of\r\nspending the Fourth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a picnic on Strawberry Island,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"We want something exciting,\" said another \"Let's have a boat-race.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Frank,\" said Ben. Lake, \"let's hear what you have got to say.\r\nSuggest something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Frank, who was always ready with some plan for\r\namusement, \"I have been thinking, for two or three days, of something\r\nwhich, I believe, will afford us a great deal of sport. In the first\r\nplace, I suppose, we are all willing to pass part of the day on the\r\nriver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" answered the boys.\r\n\r\n\"The next thing,\" continued Frank, \"is to ascertain how many\r\nsail-boats we can raise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bring mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine,\" called out several voices.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's no way to do business,\" exclaimed William Johnson, who\r\nalways liked to see things go off in order. \"Let all those who have\r\nboats hold up their hands.\"\r\n\r\nSixteen hands came up, and Frank said,\r\n\r\n\"We shall be gone all day, and, of course, we want plenty of\r\nprovisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, what I thought of proposing is this: Let us take three or\r\nfour of the swiftest sailing-boats, and give the provisions into their\r\ncharge, and call them smugglers, and let the other boats play the part\r\nof revenue-cutters, or a blockading squadron, and let the smugglers\r\ntry to land the provisions on Strawberry Island, without being\r\ncaught.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's capital!\" shouted several.\r\n\r\n\"It's better than shooting game, at this time of year,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and being scolded all day by that tyrant,\" observed another, who\r\nhad belonged to the Regulators.\r\n\r\n\"It will take some time to make all our arrangements,\" said William,\r\n\"and I move that we adjourn to our house, where we can hold our\r\nmeeting in order.\"\r\n\r\nThis was readily assented to, and William led the way, followed by all\r\nthe boys, who were highly delighted at Frank's plan of spending the\r\nFourth.\r\n\r\nGeorge Butler was speedily chosen president of the meeting, and, in\r\nless than half an hour, their arrangements were completed.\r\n\r\nThe Speedwell, Champion, and Alert--the latter a fine little schooner,\r\nowned by George and Harry--were to act the part of smugglers, and Ben.\r\nLake and Thomas Benton, who had no boats, were chosen by the smugglers\r\nto assist them. The provisions, of which each boy was expected to\r\nfurnish his share, were all to be left at Mr. Butler's boat-house by\r\nsix o'clock on the following evening, where they were to be taken\r\ncharge of by the smugglers, of whom Frank was chosen leader. It was\r\nalso understood that the smugglers were to carry the provisions all in\r\none boat, and were to be allowed to take every possible advantage of\r\nthe \"men-o'-war,\" and to make every effort to land the provisions on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe other thirteen boats, which were to act as \"coast-guards,\" were to\r\nbe under the command of Charles Sheldon, a shrewd, cunning fellow, who\r\nhad the reputation of being able to handle a sail-boat as well as any\r\nboy in the village.\r\n\r\nThe coast-guards were also divided into divisions of three boats each,\r\nand a captain was appointed for each division.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements, as we have said, were speedily completed; and,\r\nalthough the coast-guards were almost wild with delight at the\r\nprospect of the exciting times that would occur during the race, they\r\nwere confident that the smugglers could be easily caught, and even\r\nsome of the smugglers themselves seemed to think that their chances of\r\nlanding the provisions were small indeed.\r\n\r\nAs the meeting was about to break up, one of the coast-guards\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"We'll have easy times catching you smugglers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Harry Butler. \"It would be funny if you\r\nshould slip up on it, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll risk that,\" said another, \"for we've got thirteen boats to your\r\nthree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Frank,\" said Charles Sheldon, \"don't you think we can catch\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered Frank, \"easily enough, if you only try. Now,\r\nboys,\" he continued, \"remember that we want all the refreshments left\r\nat Mr. Butler's boat-house, by six o'clock to-morrow evening.\"\r\n\r\nThey all promised to be on hand, and the meeting broke up.\r\n\r\nBut the coast-guards gathered in little knots in front of the house,\r\nor walked slowly toward home, talking the matter over, and\r\ncongratulating themselves on the easy manner in which the capture of\r\nthe \"contrabands\" was to be effected.\r\n\r\nThe smugglers remained together, and, as soon as the others were out\r\nof hearing, George inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we can give them the slip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, \"I am certain we can. We must not think of\r\nbeating them in sailing, because there are too many of them, but we\r\nmust outwit them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you propose to do?\" inquired Ben.\r\n\r\n\"We must get up in the morning before they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged to get up at twelve o'clock, then,\" said Thomas.\r\n\r\n\"I had rather stay up all night than have them beat us,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said George, \"you must all come and sleep at our house\r\nto-morrow night. Some of us will be sure to wake up early, and, I\r\nthink, we shall have no trouble in getting the start of the\r\ncoast-guards.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys spent some time in talking over their plans, and, finally,\r\nreluctantly separated, and started for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe Coast-guards Outwitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock in the afternoon of the following day, Frank bade\r\nhis mother and sister good-by, and he and Brave got into the\r\nSpeedwell, and sailed slowly down the creek. He found the Champion\r\nalready moored at Mr. Butler's dock, and the smugglers were all\r\nwaiting for him. As soon as he landed, Ben. Lake said,\r\n\r\n\"Frank, it is a gone case with us. I _know_ we shall be caught.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so, do you?\" asked Frank, as if not at all concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm certain of it. I overheard some conversation among the\r\ncoast-guards, this afternoon, and one of them said that Charley\r\nSheldon would have the whole fleet anchored before the mouth of the\r\ncreek at half-past two to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said William Johnson, \"they are all going to sleep in their\r\nboats to-night, and the North Star and Sampson are to act as police.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I heard Charley Sheldon say,\" chimed in Harry, \"that strict watch\r\nmust be kept of the Speedwell, and no attention paid to the other\r\nboats.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Frank. \"I'm glad of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you?\" asked George, in surprise. \"You know, we agreed to\r\ncarry the provisions all in one boat, and yours is the only one that\r\nwill hold them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Frank, we're gone suckers,\" said Ben.\r\n\r\n\"You fellows seem to be pretty well posted as to the coast-guards'\r\nintentions,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George; \"we've been spying about and playing eavesdroppers\r\nall day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have learned one thing to-day,\" said Frank, \"that pleased me very\r\nmuch, and that is that the coast-guards intend to keep spies about the\r\nboat-house all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does that please you?\" inquired Harry. \"Do you want them to\r\ndiscover all our plans, so that they may be ready for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. I'll risk good deal that they will not learn more than\r\nwe want them to know. I've thought of a way to set them on the wrong\r\nscent, and, from what I have heard, I think it will work first-rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you in half a minute,\" said Frank, \"All we have got to do\r\nis to fool the spies; then we are all right.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment several boys, belonging to the blockading squadron,\r\nentered the boat-house, bringing their refreshments, and this, of\r\ncourse, put a stop to all further conversation between the smugglers.\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock the last basket of provisions had been brought in, and\r\nthe coast-guards took their departure, after repeatedly assuring the\r\nsmugglers that their capture was certain.\r\n\r\nThe provisions had been brought in twenty medium-sized market-baskets,\r\nand one large clothes-basket that belonged to George and Harry, and\r\nseven pails. There was, also, a small bag filled with lemons, which\r\nhad been brought by Charles Sheldon.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood for some time looking at them without speaking. At\r\nlength, Thomas Benton said,\r\n\r\n\"You will have to carry them, Frank. They will make too large a load\r\nfor either of the other boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" said Frank; \"but we must make the coast-guards think\r\nthat the Alert is going to carry them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we manage that?\" inquired George.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got three or four market-baskets, a clothes-basket, one or\r\ntwo pails, and a salt-bag?\" asked Frank, without stopping to answer\r\nGeorge's question.\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" said Harry. \"I'll go up to the house and see.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way, followed by three or four of the smugglers, and the\r\narticles in question were soon brought into the boat-house.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bill,\" said Frank, \"you take this salt-bag, if you please, and\r\nfill it with smooth, round stones, about the size of lemons.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered William, who began to see through the trick.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Frank, \"we want some pieces of cloth, large enough to\r\ntie over the tops of these baskets and pails.\"\r\n\r\nThese were speedily procured, and, in a few moments, William returned\r\nwith the salt-bag filled with stones.\r\n\r\n\"Now, tell us what you intend to do,\" exclaimed Harry, whose patience\r\nwas well-nigh exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"We are making some sham provisions,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I thought so,\" said Thomas; \"but we haven't got pails and\r\nbaskets enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's nothing,\" said Frank. \"We'll fill half a dozen of these\r\nold bags with shavings, and, as soon as it grows dark, we'll pull the\r\nAlert alongside the wharf, and tumble these sham provisions into her;\r\nthen we will cover them up with that piece of sail, as if we wanted to\r\nkeep them dry. We'll be sure to fool the men-o'-war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't exactly see it,\" said Thomas.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Harry, \"as soon as we are out of sight, their spies, who\r\nare, of course, watching every movement, will go and tell Charley\r\nSheldon that we have got the things stowed away in the Alert.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very well, as far as you go,\" said Ben; \"but suppose they\r\nshould mistrust that something is in the wind, and should go to work\r\nand examine the provisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if they do?\" said Frank. \"It will be too dark for them to make\r\nmuch of an examination; and, if they put their hands into the boat,\r\nthey will feel the baskets and pails there, and will go away\r\nsatisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys now saw through the trick, and there was no longer any\r\nfeeling of doubt in their minds. They were now as certain of success\r\nas they had before been of being captured.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the \"sham provisions,\" as Frank had called them,\r\nwere all completed, and, placing them where they could be easily taken\r\nout, they locked the door, to prevent surprise, and started for the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs they were about to enter the gate, George suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"See there!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked in the direction George indicated, and saw the\r\nblockading squadron, with the exception of two boats, anchored in the\r\ncreek, just opposite the long dock. The North Star, a fine,\r\nswift-sailing little schooner, was anchored near the middle of the\r\nstream, and a boy sat in the stern sheets, reading a book. The\r\nSampson, a very large sloop-rigged boat, was standing up the creek,\r\nunder full sail. These were the \"police boats,\" and they were taking\r\ntheir stations.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where the Sampson is going,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"She's going to take her station in Duck's Creek,\" said Ben.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, Harry's expectations fell again.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" he exclaimed. \"Charley Sheldon knows too much for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" said Frank. \"This arrangement is only for to-night. When\r\nwe get up in the morning, we shall find the boats all out in the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nThis immediately reassured Harry; and, after watching the Sampson\r\nuntil she disappeared in Duck's Creek, he led the way to the house.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, as soon as it began to grow dark, they proceeded to put\r\ntheir plans into execution; but, before they started, Frank said,\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, we must watch and see how the trick takes, for I know that\r\nthere are spies now around that boat-house. As soon as we get the sham\r\nprovisions into the boat, one or two of us had better slip down into\r\nthe willows behind the wharf, and see what course things are going to\r\ntake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Harry, \"suppose you and Bill act as spies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed. Come on, but don't act as if you suspected anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he led the way toward the boat-house.\r\n\r\nTwo of the boys busied themselves in bringing out the sham provisions,\r\nand the others brought the Alert alongside, and fastened her to the\r\ndock, in front of the boat-house. Frank and Harry then got down into\r\nthe boat, and the other boys passed the provisions down to them, and\r\nthey placed them in such a manner as to take up as much space as\r\npossible. They were soon all stowed away, and covered over with a\r\nlarge sail, as if to keep off the dew.\r\n\r\nBen and George then got into a small skiff that lay at the dock, and\r\ntowed the Alert out into the middle of the creek, and anchored her.\r\nAs soon as this was done they returned, and the smugglers began to\r\namuse themselves by pushing each other about the wharf. They all\r\nappeared to enter heartily into the sport, and kept nearing the\r\nwillows which extended along the bank of the creek, close to the\r\nwharf, and Frank and William, watching their opportunity, concealed\r\nthemselves, and the others ran toward the house. They had hardly\r\ndisappeared, when the smugglers saw several boys steal cautiously\r\naround the corner of the boat-house, where they had been concealed,\r\nand one of them crept up the bank, to assure himself that the coast\r\nwas clear, while the others remained in the shadow of the house. The\r\nformer, who proved to be Charles Sheldon, the commander of the\r\ncoast-guards, as soon as he had satisfied himself that the smugglers\r\nhad gone into the house, called out, in a low whisper, to the others,\r\nwho were the captains of the divisions of the squadron,\r\n\r\n\"All right, boys; go ahead, but be careful not to make any noise. I\r\ndidn't see Frank Nelson's dog go into the yard,\" he continued; \"he\r\nmust be around here somewhere. We must not let him hear us.\"\r\n\r\nBrave _was_, as Charles had said, \"around there somewhere.\" He was\r\nlying by his master's side, among the willows, no doubt wondering at\r\nthe strange things that were going on, and, well-trained as he was,\r\nit was with great difficulty that Frank could keep him quiet.\r\n\r\nThe coast-guards crossed the wharf with noiseless steps, and,\r\nunfastening the skiff which the smugglers had just used, they climbed\r\ndown into it, and pushed off toward the Alert. A few strokes brought\r\nthem alongside of her, and, thrusting their arms under the sail, they\r\nbegan the examination which the smugglers had so much dreaded.\r\n\r\n\"What do you find?\" inquired Charles, who still kept watch at the top\r\nof the bank.\r\n\r\n\"Here are a lot of baskets and pails,\" said one\r\n\r\n\"And here's the large basket that George and Harry brought,\" said\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"What are these round things in this bag, I wonder?\" said the one who\r\nhad first spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those are the lemons I brought,\" said Charles.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious! how hard they are!\" continued the boy, trying to dig his\r\nfingers into them.\r\n\r\nAt this, Frank and William, who, of course, had heard every word of\r\nthe conversation, and had sat fairly trembling with excitement,\r\nfearful that their trick would be discovered, could scarcely refrain\r\nfrom laughing outright. Had it been daylight, the ruse of the\r\nsmugglers would certainly have been detected, but, as it was, the\r\ncoast-guards never mistrusted that any thing was wrong. The night was\r\nrather dark, and the sham provisions were so neatly tied up, and so\r\ncarefully stowed away, that the deception was complete.\r\n\r\n\"I guess they are all here,\" said one of the boys, at length.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come ashore, then,\" said Charles, \"and let's be off.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys pulled back to the wharf, and Charles continued,\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think that the Alert would hold all of the refreshments, did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered one of the boys, whom the smugglers recognized as James\r\nPorter; \"I guess it was a tight squeeze; I could hardly get my hand in\r\nbetween the baskets.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose the smugglers intend to do?\" inquired another.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Charles, \"unless they propose to get up in\r\nthe morning before we do, and slip over to the island before we know\r\nit. I wonder how they felt when they saw us taking our positions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you suppose made them put the provisions in the Alert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think I can see through that easily enough,\" said James. \"Frank\r\nknows that we expected that he was going to carry them over to the\r\nisland, and he calculates to get us to chase him and give the Alert a\r\nchance to land the provisions. He is a cunning fellow, but this time\r\nwe are too sharp for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why Frank don't send some one out to act as a spy,\" said\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he's afraid that he would be taken prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nWe may as well state here (and we should have done so before) that it\r\nhad been agreed that if one side could catch any of the other acting\r\nas spies, they were at liberty to hold them as prisoners until the\r\nrace was over, and that the prisoner should, if required, give his\r\ncaptors all the information possible relative to the movements and\r\nplans of his party, and they could also require him to lend assistance\r\nin carrying out their own. The prisoner, of course, was allowed the\r\nprivilege of escaping, if he could.\r\n\r\nThis _was_ the reason why the smugglers had not sent out any spies;\r\nand, if the coast-guards had been aware that Frank and William were\r\nhidden away in the willows, they could easily have captured them, and,\r\naccording to the agreement, obliged them to divulge all their plans.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Charles, \"we don't want any prisoners now, for we know\r\nall their plans; but I wanted to catch Frank this morning, for I was\r\nafraid he would beat us. If he should find out that this trick was\r\ndiscovered, he would plan another in five minutes. I guess we had\r\nbetter remain where we are to-night,\" he continued, \"and, at\r\nhalf-past two o'clock, we will pull out into the river, and blockade\r\nthe creek. All we have to do is to take care of the Alert, and let the\r\nother boats do as they please. But we had better be off, or the\r\nsmugglers may slip out and make some of us prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the spies departed as cautiously and quickly as they had come.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had gone, the smugglers arose from their places of\r\nconcealment, and stole into the house, and acquainted the other boys\r\nwith the success of their stratagem.\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying a hearty laugh at the expense of the coast-guards, led\r\nby George and Harry, they ran up stairs into the \"large chamber,\" a\r\nroom containing three beds, and they were soon snug between the\r\nsheets. But sleep was, for a long time, out of the question; they\r\nlaughed and talked until their jaws ached, and the hands of the old\r\nclock that stood in the room pointed to twelve; then they allowed\r\ntheir tired tongues to rest, and lay for a long time, each occupied\r\nwith his own thoughts, and, finally, one after the other fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed on, and nothing was heard but their gentle breathing.\r\nSuddenly Harry, who always talked in his sleep when any thing exciting\r\nwas going on, turned over in bed with a jerk, and began to mutter\r\nsome unintelligible words. All at once, raising himself to a sitting\r\nposture, he sang out, at the top of his voice,\r\n\r\n\"Starboard your helm there, George--starboard your helm; bring her\r\naround quick. The Alert can show as clean a pair of heels as any boat\r\nabout the village.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant the other boys were awake, and Harry continued to shout\r\nhis directions, until several hearty thumps on the back caused him to\r\nchange his tune.\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone!\" he shouted. \"We haven't cheated you. We promised to\r\ncarry the provisions all over in one boat, and we've done it.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was quickly dragged out of bed and placed upon his feet, and he\r\nwas wide awake in an instant, but he stood in the middle of the room,\r\nas if bewildered, while the others rolled on the beds, convulsed with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nAt length, William Johnson, who was the first that could speak,\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what time it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait until I light this candle, and we'll see,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, don't do that,\" said Frank. \"The coast-guards may be on the\r\nwatch, and, if they see a light in the house, will be getting ready\r\nfor us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, going to the clock, he opened it, and, feeling of the hands,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\"It's about ten minutes to three.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" inquired Ben.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and see what our friends of the squadron are doing,\" said\r\nThomas; \"and, if they are not on hand, we can slip over and land our\r\ngoods.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time every one was dressed, and they crept carefully down\r\nstairs and out of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a minute, boys,\" said Frank. \"I will bet there are spies\r\naround that boat-house now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's take them prisoners,\" exclaimed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I was about to propose,\" said Frank; \"but, in order\r\nto do it, we had better divide into two parties, so as to surround the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said George, \"three of us will go up the road, and cross over\r\nby the bridge, and the rest of you can go down the road, and get into\r\nthe willows behind the mill.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Frank. \"We will meet at the back of the\r\nboat-house.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys accordingly separated, and started in different directions.\r\n\r\nFrank and his party, which consisted of Harry and Ben, threaded their\r\nway through the garden, and across a meadow, until they arrived\r\nopposite Mr. Butler's mill. Here they crossed the road, and, after a\r\ncareful reconnoissance, entered the willows, and crawled, almost on\r\ntheir hands and knees, toward the boat-house. At length they arrived\r\nat the place where they were to meet their companions, but nothing was\r\nto be seen or heard of them.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they have not been taken prisoners,\" whispered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they have,\" said Ben, \"because we should have heard\r\nsomething of it. They are not the ones to give up without a struggle.\r\nBut I don't see any thing of the spies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Harry. \"They must be around the other side of the\r\nboat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they are there,\" said Frank, \"we will soon make them show\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, he seized a branch above his head, and shook it\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's no way,\" whispered Harry, excitedly; \"you will frighten\r\nthe--\"\r\n\r\n\"--sh! there they are!\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, the smugglers saw a boy come cautiously around the\r\ncorner of the boat-house. He gazed impatiently toward the willows, and\r\nuttered a low whistle.\r\n\r\nFrank instantly answered it, and the boy came down the bank, and said,\r\nin a low voice,\r\n\r\n\"Come out here, Jim. I thought you would never relieve us. No signs of\r\nthe smugglers yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be mistaken,\" said Frank, springing lightly from his\r\nconcealment; and, before the coast-guard could recover from his\r\nsurprise, he found himself a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make any noise,\" said Frank. \"Where's your companion? There\r\nmust be two of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is another one,\" answered the prisoner. \"Ned Wilbur is\r\naround the other side of the boat-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ben,\" said Frank, \"if you will watch this fellow, Harry and I\r\nwill see what we can do for Ned.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he went carefully around one side of the boat-house, and\r\nHarry disappeared around the other. Frank reached the end of the house\r\nfirst, and discovered the coast-guard standing in the door-way, as\r\nmotionless as a statue. He was waiting for Harry to make his\r\nappearance at the opposite end, when the sentinel suddenly uttered an\r\nejaculation of surprise, and bounded up the bank; but, just as he\r\nreached the top, a dark form, which seemed to rise out of the ground,\r\nclasped the fleeting coast-guard in its arms, and a voice, which Frank\r\nrecognized as William Johnson's, said, in a low whisper,\r\n\r\n\"You're my prisoner!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just my luck,\" said the crest-fallen sentinel, bitterly, as\r\nWilliam led him down the bank. \"I told Charley Sheldon that we would\r\nbe sure to be gobbled up if we were stationed here. Now, I suppose,\r\nyou want me to tell all our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't,\" answered Harry; \"we know all your plans already.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the smugglers had all come in, and, holding fast to their\r\ncaptives, they held a consultation, in which it was decided that it\r\nwould be best to reconnoiter before attempting to leave the creek. It\r\nwas very dark, and not a sound broke the stillness of the night; but\r\nthe smugglers were too cunning to believe that the coast was clear,\r\nfor they knew that the enemy would resort to every possible means to\r\neffect their capture.\r\n\r\nThree of the smugglers were directed to get into Mr. Butler's yawl,\r\ntaking one of the prisoners with them, and drop down to the mouth of\r\nGlen's Creek, and note the position of the enemy there; and Frank and\r\nthe other boys stepped into the skiff, and started up toward Ducks'\r\nCreek, to ascertain the condition of affairs, taking Ned with them.\r\nThey pulled rapidly, but noiselessly, along, and had almost reached\r\nthe creek, when a strong, cheery voice, directly before them, called\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" whispered Harry, \"we're discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess not,\" said Frank. \"Ned,\" he continued, turning to the\r\nprisoner, \"you must talk for us. Answer them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" shouted Ned, in reply to the hail.\r\n\r\n\"What boat is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dispatch boat,\" answered Ned, prompted by Frank; \"and we bring orders\r\nfor you to pull down and join the fleet, which is now blockading the\r\nmouth of Glen's Creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the voice. \"We've been waiting an hour for that\r\norder. This playing police is dull business.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the smugglers heard the rattling of a chain, as if the anchor was\r\nbeing pulled up.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to make haste,\" whispered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Come, hurry up there, now,\" shouted Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a few moments, the Sampson, propelled by four oars, shot past\r\nthem, on her way down the creek.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I call pretty well done,\" said Ben, as soon as the\r\ncoast-guards were out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Ned. \"It goes against me to fool a fellow in that way;\r\nand my own friends, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe smugglers now continued on their way, and a few strong pulls\r\nbrought them within a short distance of the mouth of Ducks' Creek; and\r\nFrank, who was at the helm, turned the boat's head toward the shore,\r\nand, as soon as her keel touched the bottom, he and Ben sprang out,\r\nleaving Harry to watch the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThey had landed upon Reynard's Island, and immediately started for the\r\nopposite side, to learn, if possible, what was going on upon the\r\nriver. Every thing was as silent as midnight; and the smugglers were\r\nobliged to move very carefully, for the slightest sound--the snapping\r\nof a twig or the rustling of a leaf--could be heard at a long\r\ndistance. After proceeding a quarter of a mile in this cautious\r\nmanner, they reached the opposite side of the island.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ben, after trying in vain to peer through the darkness,\r\n\"how do matters stand? I wonder if we could not have slipped by their\r\npolice, and reached the island, before they knew it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Frank, \"not by a good deal. We should certainly have\r\nbeen captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know? I can't see any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can I; but listen, and you will _hear_ something. They are\r\ntaking their positions.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys remained silent, and the suppressed murmur of voices, the\r\nstrokes of muffled oars, and, now and then, a gentle splashing in the\r\nwater, as of an anchor dropped carefully overboard, could be\r\ndistinctly heard.\r\n\r\n\"I am still of the opinion,\" said Ben, \"that we could run the blockade\r\nbefore they could catch us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I still think that we should get caught,\" said Frank. \"If we\r\nshould attempt to hoist a sail, it could be heard across the river;\r\nbesides, there is no breeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, try the oars.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would overtake us before we had gone twenty rods. You must\r\nremember that they outnumber us, six to one, and could easily tire us\r\nout, or cut us off from the island. Wait until the breeze springs up,\r\nand then we will see what we can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" whispered Ben, suddenly; \"some of the boats are coming down\r\nthis way. They are sending a division of the fleet to guard Ducks'\r\nCreek.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved. The slow, measured strokes of oars came nearer and\r\nnearer, and, finally, the tall, raking masts of three of the\r\nswiftest-sailing boats in the squadron could be dimly seen moving down\r\nthe river toward the creek. As they approached, the smugglers\r\ndiscovered that two boys, in a light skiff, led the way, and one of\r\nthem, who proved to be Charles Sheldon, pointed out the position he\r\nwished each boat to occupy. The places assigned them were not directly\r\nopposite the mouth of the creek, but a little up the river, and about\r\ntwenty feet from the shore; and this, afterward, proved to be a very\r\nfavorable circumstance for the smugglers.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said Charles, after he had placed the little vessels to\r\nhis satisfaction, \"keep a good look-out up the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think,\" said the captain of the division \"that you ought to\r\nhave us anchor directly in the mouth of the creek. We shall have a\r\ngood stiff breeze before long, and the Alert might slip out at any\r\ntime, and, before we could hoist a sail, she would be half-way across\r\nthe river.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she will trouble you down here,\" said Charles. \"Frank\r\nNelson wouldn't be foolish enough to send her out here, for it's a\r\ngood quarter of a mile below the foot of the island; and, even if she\r\ndoes come out here, and succeeds in getting by you, all we will have\r\nto do will be to send a division down to the foot of the island to\r\nmeet her there, and then her capture is certain. Now, remember, keep\r\nan eye open to everything that goes on up the river. Never mind the\r\nSpeedwell and Champion--let them go where they please; but, if you see\r\nthe Alert, why, you know what to do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Charles and his attendant pulled back up the river.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ben,\" said Frank, \"we've heard enough to know that we have\r\nfooled them nicely; so let's go back.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was no easy undertaking. The way to their boat lay\r\nthrough bushes that could scarcely be penetrated, even in the\r\nday-time. The coast-guards were anchored close by the shore, and the\r\nslightest noise would arouse their suspicions.\r\n\r\nFrank led the way on his hands and knees, carefully choosing his\r\nground, and they, at length, succeeded in reaching their boat, without\r\ndisturbing the coast-guards.\r\n\r\nA few moments' pulling brought them alongside Mr. Butler's wharf,\r\nwhere they found the others waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\"What news?\" inquired George, as they clambered up out of the boat.\r\n\r\nFrank explained, in a few words, the position of the squadron at the\r\nmouth of Ducks' Creek, as well as the conversation they had overheard,\r\nand also inquired of George the result of his observations.\r\n\r\n\"It was too dark to see much,\" he answered; \"but we could plainly hear\r\nthem taking their positions opposite the mouth of the creek. It will\r\nbe hard work to get through them, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to work it, Frank?\" inquired Ben.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I thought of doing,\" he answered \"By the way\r\nCharley Sheldon spoke, I should judge that he expects to see the Alert\r\nstart from Glen's Creek; so, I think, it would be a good plan, as soon\r\nas the breeze springs up, to have the Champion and Alert drop down\r\nDucks' Creek, and let the former run out and start for the island.\r\nThe coast-guards will not give chase, of course, but will think it is\r\nonly a ruse of ours to make them believe that the Alert is going to\r\nstart from the same place, and that will make them watch Glen's Creek\r\ncloser than ever, and the Alert will have a chance to get a good start\r\nbefore they can hoist their sails, and, while they are after her, Ben\r\nand I will run out and land our goods.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to do it,\" said William, approvingly. \"We will fool\r\nthem so completely that they will not want to hear of smugglers again\r\nfor six months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and get some breakfast,\" said George. \"Never go to work on\r\nan empty stomach, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, come on,\" said Harry, taking each of the captive coast-guards by\r\nthe arm; \"we never feed our prisoners on half rations.\"\r\n\r\nAfter \"stowing away\" a large supply of bread and milk, the smugglers,\r\nin company with their prisoners, again repaired to the boat-house. By\r\nthis time it was five o'clock, and the breeze which the coast-guards\r\nhad predicted began to spring up, and promised to freshen into a\r\ncapital \"sailing wind.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the _real_ provisions were all packed away, as\r\nclosely as possible, in the Speedwell, and the load was as large as\r\nshe could well carry, there being scarcely room enough left for the\r\naction of the sails.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we are all ready now,\" said Frank; \"so, Bill, you might as\r\nwell drop down Ducks' Creek and sail out.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered William.\r\n\r\nAnd he and Thomas clambered down into the boat, with the prisoners,\r\nthe sails were hoisted, and the Champion was soon hidden from sight by\r\nthe tall reeds and bushes that lined the banks of the creek.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Harry,\" continued Frank, \"Ben and I will take our boat and hide\r\nbehind the point, and, in about five minutes, you may follow the\r\nChampion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, make use of your best seamanship,\" said Ben. \"You can lead them\r\na long chase, if you try.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that we will do our best,\" said George.\r\n\r\nThe Speedwell's sails were hoisted, and Frank took his seat at the\r\nhelm, while Ben placed himself so as to assist in managing the sails.\r\nBrave took his usual station in the bow, and they moved slowly down\r\nthe creek.\r\n\r\nThe point of which Frank had spoken was a long, low neck of land,\r\ncovered with trees, which completely concealed the mouth of Glen's\r\nCreek. In a few moments they reached this point, and the Speedwell's\r\nbow ran high upon the sand, and the boys sprang out, and hurried over\r\nto the other side of the point, to watch the proceedings on the river,\r\nwhile Brave, at his master's command, remained in the boat. Concealing\r\nthemselves behind a large log, they waited impatiently for the\r\nappearance of the Champion.\r\n\r\nThe vessels of the squadron, with the exception of the division\r\nstationed at the foot of Reynard's Island, were anchored in a\r\nsemicircle directly before the mouth of Glen's Creek, from which it\r\nwas expected that the Alert would start. Each sloop was manned by two\r\nboys, and the schooners had a crew of four. Every one stood at his\r\npost, and was ready to move at the word.\r\n\r\n\"They meant to be ready for us, didn't they?\" asked Frank. \"I wonder\r\nif they thought we would be foolish enough to send the Alert out of\r\nthis creek, in the face of all those boats?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Ben. \"I suppose they thought--See there!\r\nthere goes the Champion.\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked down the river, and saw that the stanch little sloop had\r\nalready run the blockade, and was standing boldly toward the island.\r\nHer appearance was sudden and wholly unexpected and several of the\r\ncoast-guards sprang to their feet, and a dozen sails were half-way up\r\nthe mast in a twinkling; but, as soon as they discovered that it was\r\nnot the Alert, they quickly returned to their posts, and, in a moment,\r\nall the bustle and confusion was over.\r\n\r\nThe eye of every boy in the squadron was now directed toward Glen's\r\nCreek, expecting, every moment, to see the schooner round the point.\r\n\r\nThe Champion had accomplished, perhaps, half the distance across the\r\nriver, when the Alert suddenly shot from Ducks' Creek, and, hauling\r\naround before the wind, ran in between two of the blockading fleet, so\r\nclose as to almost graze them, and stood toward the foot of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the coast-guards could recover from their surprise, Charles\r\nshouted,\r\n\r\n\"Up anchor--quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment he called out,\r\n\r\n\"Jim, take your division, and creep down the shore of the island, and\r\nbe ready to catch her there, if she gets away from us.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was a \"great hurrying\" among the coast-guards.\r\nThe anchors were drawn up with a jerk, the sails flew up the masts,\r\nand the little fleet bore rapidly down upon the smuggler.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Frank saw that the race had fairly begun, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Now's our time, Ben!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran back to their boat, and hastily shoved from the shore, and\r\nthe Speedwell, making good her name, was soon plowing the river, in\r\nthe direction of the island.\r\n\r\nSo intent were the coast-guards upon catching the Alert, that they\r\nthought of nothing else; and Frank rounded the head of the island, and\r\nlanded, without being discovered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, George and Harry were leading their pursuers a long chase.\r\nUnder their skillful management--standing first on one tack and then\r\non the other--they had succeeded in outmaneuvering several of the\r\nswiftest-sailing vessels in the squadron.\r\n\r\nTwo or three small sloops had succeeded in getting between the Alert\r\nand the island; but Harry, who was at the helm, did not deem them\r\nworthy a moment's notice. He was confident that his schooner, by her\r\nsuperior sailing qualities, would soon leave these behind also.\r\n\r\nThe smugglers began to grow jubilant over their success, and George\r\ncalled out,\r\n\r\n\"Where are your men-o'-war now? Throw us a line, and we'll tow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you coast-guards,\" chimed in Harry. \"You will never catch\r\nus, at this rate.\"\r\n\r\nIf the smugglers _had_ succeeded in eluding their pursuers, it would,\r\nindeed, have been an achievement worth boasting of; but they had to\r\ndeal with those who were as cunning and skillful as themselves.\r\nCharles was not to be beaten so easily; and, although he said nothing,\r\nthe smugglers saw him smile and shake his head, as if he were certain\r\nthat he could yet win the day.\r\n\r\n\"Can you discover any fast boats ahead of us, George?\" inquired Harry.\r\n\r\nGeorge rose to his feet to take a survey of the squadron, and\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n\"No, there are only two or three little things standing across our\r\nbows, but we'll soon--We're caught, sure as shooting!\" he suddenly\r\nexclaimed, changing his tone. \"Bring her around before the\r\nwind--quick! There's the North Star, Sunshine, and Sampson. We might\r\nas well haul down the sails.\"\r\n\r\nJames Porter's division, which had been \"laying to\" at the foot of\r\nGlen's Island, now bore down upon the Alert, and George had just\r\ndiscovered them; and they were coming on in such a manner that escape\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Harry, as soon as he had noted the positions of the\r\napproaching vessels, \"we are caught. We began to brag too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we don't lose any thing,\" said George. \"Frank has landed the\r\nprovisions long before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it; but still I wish we could have beaten them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think now, Harry?\" asked Charles, whose boat was\r\nfollowing close in the wake of the Alert.\r\n\r\n\"I think we are done for.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as Harry \"luffed in the wind,\" George drew down the sails, and\r\ngave up the struggle.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the little fleet closed about the smuggler, and, to\r\nprevent accident, the sails were all hauled down, and the boats lay\r\nmotionless on the water.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" said Charles, \"you fellows worked it pretty well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered George, as if a little crest-fallen at their defeat.\r\n\"We did the best we could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we had more provisions than this,\" said one of the captains\r\nof the squadron, pulling his boat alongside of the Alert. \"I didn't\r\nthink you could get them all in here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled up the covering, and looked under it.\r\n\r\n\"They are packed in tight, you see,\" said Harry, who wished to keep up\r\nthe \"sell,\" as he called it, as long as possible.\r\n\r\n\"What are in these bags?\" inquired one.\r\n\r\n\"Shavings,\" answered George. \"We thought we might want to kindle a\r\nfire for something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, George,\" said James Porter, standing up in his boat to get a\r\ngood view of the things in the Alert. \"I wish you would feel in my\r\nbasket, and get a cup that is in there, and pass it over this way. I'm\r\nthirsty. I was so excited,\" he continued, taking off his hat and\r\nwiping the perspiration from his forehead, \"that I sweat as if I had\r\nbeen dumped in the river. There isn't a dry rag on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is your basket?\" inquired Harry, struggling hard to suppress a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"It's a brown basket, with a white cover,\" answered James.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry were too full of laughter to trust themselves to\r\nspeak; but Charles exclaimed, as he drew aside the covering,\r\n\r\n\"There's no brown basket here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be,\" said one of the coast-guards; \"I brought my\r\nthings in a brown basket.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" exclaimed another.\r\n\r\n\"There's a cheat somewhere,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't done as you agreed,\" said Charles. \"You promised to carry\r\nall the things in one boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what you agreed to do,\" shouted several.\r\n\r\n\"And we've kept our promise,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Then, where's _my_ basket?\" inquired one of the boys, who had failed\r\nto discover it among the things in the Alert.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet the Champion carried some of the provisions over,\" said\r\nanother, \"for there are not half of them here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the Champion didn't have a thing in her,\" said a third. \"She\r\npassed so close to my boat, that I could have jumped into her, and I\r\ntook particular pains to see that she was empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here are the things that I brought, at any rate,\" said Charles,\r\nwho had just caught sight of the bag which contained, as he supposed,\r\nhis lemons. \"My goodness!\" he continued, as he lifted them out of the\r\nboat, \"how heavy they are!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to untie the bag, and soon disclosed to the view of the\r\ncoast-guards, not the lemons, but almost half a peck of smooth, round\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry, who could contain themselves no longer, rolled on\r\nthe bottom of the boat, convulsed with laughter; and several ready\r\nhands tore off the coverings of the baskets and pails, and they were\r\nfound to be empty.\r\n\r\nA more astonished set of boys one never saw; and, as soon as they\r\ncould speak, they burst out with a volley of ejaculations that will\r\nhardly bear repetition.\r\n\r\n\"We've been chasing the wrong boat,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered another, \"and I knew it would be so. That Frank\r\nNelson is too much of a Yankee for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Speedwell--the Speedwell!\" shouted another; \"keep a good look-out\r\nfor her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're too late,\" said Harry, with a laugh, \"the provisions were\r\nlanded long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it. I didn't see any thing of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you didn't,\" said Charles; \"you were too intent on catching\r\nthe Alert. Boys,\" he continued, \"we're fairly beaten. Let's start for\r\nthe island.\"\r\n\r\nThe coast-guards silently obeyed, and the smugglers refrained from\r\nmaking any remarks, for they saw that the squadron's crew took their\r\ndefeat sorely to heart.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the little fleet rounded the foot of the island, and\r\nthe boys discovered the Champion and Speedwell, lying with their bows\r\nhigh upon the sand, and their crews were busy carrying the provisions\r\nunder the shade of a large oak, that stood near the water's edge.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last vessel came in sight, the smugglers on shore\r\ngreeted them with three hearty cheers, which George and Harry answered\r\nwith a will, but the coast-guards remained silent.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they had all landed, and the smugglers joined their\r\ncompanions; and Charles took off his hat, and said to the\r\ncoast-guards,\r\n\r\n\"Boys, I want to have just one word with you. We have been beaten,\" he\r\ncontinued, as they gathered silently about him, \"completely outwitted;\r\nbut it was fairly done. We took all the advantage of the smugglers\r\nthat we could, but they have beaten us at our own game. I feel as\r\ncheap as any of you do, but it can't be helped now; and there's no use\r\nof having unpleasant feelings about it, for that would spoil a good\r\nday's sport. If we didn't catch them, we did our best, and we had a\r\ngood, exciting race--one that I wouldn't have missed for a good deal.\r\nNow, boys, show that you appreciate the good trick that has been\r\nplayed on us, by giving the smugglers three hearty cheers.\"\r\n\r\nThis little speech--showing Charles to be a boy of good feeling--had\r\nthe effect of convincing the coast-guards that to manifest any\r\nill-will at their defeat would be both unkind and selfish, and the\r\ncheer that rose from forty strong lungs was almost deafening. The\r\nsmugglers, who had heard what Charles had said, cheered lustily, in\r\nturn, for the coast-guards, and instantly every unkind feeling\r\nvanished. The coast-guards readily entered into conversation with the\r\nsmugglers, and the latter explained the trick of which they had made\r\nuse, as well as the manner in which the capture of the prisoners was\r\naffected, and the adventure with the police-boat; and, although the\r\ncoast-guards were provoked at themselves for \"not having more sense,\"\r\nas they termed it, they could not refrain from joining in a hearty\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nBy this time the refreshments had all been carried under the tree of\r\nwhich we have spoken, where there was a smooth grass-plat, which made\r\na nice place to set the table.\r\n\r\nThe boys had spent some time relating various incidents that had\r\noccurred during the chase, when Ben suddenly inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys, what's to be the order of the day? You know that we came\r\nover here to enjoy ourselves, and we had better be about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Charles, \"that it would be a good plan to appoint a\r\ncommittee to arrange those eatables. We came away without our\r\nbreakfast, and I, for one, feel hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's where we had the advantage of you,\" said Thomas. \"While you\r\nwere hurrying around, and taking your positions, we were eating our\r\nbreakfast. You see, we took matters easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And beat us, after all,\" said one of the coast-guards; \"it's too bad.\r\nBut let's have that committee appointed.\"\r\n\r\nA dozen boys were speedily chosen to set the table, and the others,\r\ncatching up all the empty pails and baskets they could find, scattered\r\nover the island in search of strawberries.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour they met again under the tree, and found the\r\nrefreshments all ready for them, and they fell to work in earnest. So\r\nfull were they of their sport, that it took them two hours to eat\r\ntheir dinner, as they had said they had come to enjoy themselves, and\r\nfelt in duty bound to eat all their baskets contained.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, one of the smugglers proposed to go squirrel-hunting;\r\nbut many of the coast-guards had passed the preceding night without\r\nany sleep, and, to use their own expression, they \"didn't feel like\r\nit;\" so this project was abandoned, and the boys lay on the grass,\r\nunder the tree, telling stories, until almost three o'clock, and then\r\nbegan to get ready to start for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA Queer Cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, it would be almost an impossibility for sixteen\r\nsail-boats to go any where in company without trying their speed,\r\nespecially if they were sailed by boys. When our heroes stepped into\r\ntheir vessels, each skipper made up his mind that his boat must be the\r\nfirst one to touch the opposite shore. Not a word was said about a\r\nrace, but every one knew that one would be sure to come off. Every\r\nthing was done in a hurry, and the little vessels were all afloat in a\r\nmoment. They were on the leeward side of the island--that is, the side\r\nfrom the wind--and they would be obliged to get around to the opposite\r\nside before they could use their sails.\r\n\r\nThe coast-guards shoved their boats out into the current, and allowed\r\nthemselves to float down toward the foot of the island, thinking that\r\ncourse easier than pulling, against the current, up to the head of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nFrank noticed this movement, and said, in a low voice, to the\r\nsmugglers,\r\n\r\n\"Don't follow them, boys. They will find themselves becalmed in less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour. The breeze is dying away. If you want to\r\nbeat them, hoist your sails, and get out your oars, and row up to the\r\nhead of the island; we can reach it before they reach the foot, and,\r\nbesides, the current will carry them further down the river than they\r\nwant to go.\"\r\n\r\nThe smugglers did as Frank had directed; and as they moved from the\r\nshore, and turned up the river, one of the coast-guards called out,\r\n\r\n\"Where are you fellows going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home,\" answered Ben.\r\n\r\n\"You are taking the longest and hardest way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The longest way around is the nearest way home, you know,\" answered\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it is, in this instance,\" said James Porter. \"Let's\r\nsee who will be at the long dock first.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the smugglers.\r\n\r\nAnd they disappeared behind a high-wooded promontory of the island.\r\n\r\nIt was hard work, pulling against a current that ran four miles an\r\nhour, but they were accustomed to it, and the thought of again\r\nbeating the coast-guards gave strength to their arms.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a sudden filling of the sails announced that they had\r\ncaught the breeze. The oars were drawn in, and every sheet hauled\r\ntaut, and, when they rounded the head of the island, not one of the\r\nsquadron was in sight.\r\n\r\n\"I expected,\" said Harry, speaking in a loud voice, so that the others\r\ncould hear, \"that they would feel the wind long before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if they had,\" answered Frank, \"we could have beaten them easily\r\nenough. You see, when they come around the foot of the island, they\r\nwill be some distance below the long dock, and the current will carry\r\nthem still further down, while we are above it, and can sail right\r\ndown to it. Here they come!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked down the river, and saw the men-o'-war rapidly\r\nfollowing each other around the foot of the island.\r\n\r\n\"I guess they have discovered their mistake before this time,\" said\r\nWilliam. \"Now,\" he continued, as he drew his mainsail down a little\r\ncloser \"the Champion is going to be the first to sail into the creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the game, is it?\" said Frank. \"Ben, perch yourself up on the\r\nwindward side, and we'll see which is the best boat.\"\r\n\r\nBen did as he was desired, and the little vessels increased their\r\nspeed, and bounded over the gentle swells as if some of their crews'\r\nspirit had been infused into them. They had started nearly even--the\r\nAlert and Champion being a little in advance of the Speedwell--and the\r\nboys knew that the race was to be a fair trial of the speed of their\r\nboats. The Alert and Speedwell had never been \"matched\" before, and\r\nthe boys were anxious to learn their comparative speed. The former was\r\nthe \"champion\" boat of the village, and Harry and George were\r\nconfident that Frank's \"tub,\" as they jokingly called it, would soon\r\nbe distanced. Frank thought so, too; but the reputation of owning the\r\nswiftest boat in the village was well worth trying for, and he\r\ndetermined to do his best.\r\n\r\nSince his race with the Champion, he had made larger sails for his\r\nboat, and added a flying-jib and a gaff-topsail, and he found that her\r\nspeed was almost doubled.\r\n\r\nThe Champion soon fell behind, and the two rival boats were left to\r\nfinish the race, which, for a long time, seemed undecided. But, at\r\nlength, the Speedwell, with her strong mast groaning and creaking\r\nunder the weight of the heavy canvas, began to gain steadily, and soon\r\npassed the Alert. Ten minutes' run brought them across the river; and\r\nwhen Frank, proud of the victory he had gained, rounded the long dock,\r\nthe Alert was full four rods behind.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was rapidly dying away, and not one of the coast-guards had\r\nyet reached the shore. Some of them had been carried almost a mile\r\nbelow the creek, and lay with the sails idly flapping against the\r\nmasts.\r\n\r\nFrank and Ben sailed slowly along up the creek, and, when they arrived\r\nat the end of the dock, the Speedwell was \"made fast,\" and the boys\r\nstarted to get their mail.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the post-office, Frank stepped up to the\r\n\"pigeon-hole,\" and the postmaster handed him two letters; one was\r\naddressed to his mother, and the other bore his own name, written in a\r\nfull, round, school-boy's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ben,\" he exclaimed, as he broke the seal, \"I've got a letter from\r\nArchie. I wrote to him a month ago; I should think it was about time\r\nto get an answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"See if he says any thing about getting a letter from me,\" said Ben.\r\n\"I haven't heard from him in a long time.\"\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, it may not be improper to say a word about\r\nArchie Winters. He was, as we have already said, Frank's cousin, and\r\nlived in the city of Portland. He was just Frank's age, and, like him,\r\nwas kind and generous; but he was not the boy for books. When in\r\nschool, he was an obedient and industrious pupil, and learned very\r\nreadily; but, when four o'clock came, he was the first to lay aside\r\nhis books. He was very fond of rural sports, and, for a city boy, was\r\na very expert hunter; he even considered himself able to compete with\r\nFrank. He was also passionately fond of pets, and, if he could have\r\nhad his own way, he would have possessed every cat and dog in the\r\ncity. His father was a wealthy ship-builder, and Archie was an only\r\nchild. But he was not, as is generally the case, spoiled by\r\nindulgence; on the contrary, his parents always required his prompt\r\nand cheerful obedience, and, when out of their sight, Archie was very\r\ncareful to do nothing of which he thought his parents would not\r\napprove. Every vacation he paid a visit to his cousin, and sometimes\r\nstaid until late in the winter, to engage in his favorite sport. He\r\nwas well known to the village boys, among whom his easy and obliging\r\nmanners had won many a steadfast friend.\r\n\r\nBut let us now return to the letter, which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     PORTLAND, _June_ 28, 18--.\r\n\r\n     DEAR COUSIN: Your letter of the 16th of last month was duly\r\n     received, and, I suppose, you think it is about time for me\r\n     to answer it. They say that a person who is good at making\r\n     excuses is good for nothing else; but, I suppose, you will\r\n     expect some apology for my seeming neglect. You perhaps\r\n     remember hearing your mother speak of James Sherman, a cousin\r\n     whom we had never seen. About two weeks since, father\r\n     received a letter from his mother, stating that she and James\r\n     would be at our house in about three days. Well, they came\r\n     agreeably to notice, and I have had the pleasure of\r\n     entertaining our cousin ever since. I have had to pilot him\r\n     around, and show him all the sights, and I have had time for\r\n     nothing else.\r\n\r\n     I will not tell you what sort of a fellow he is; I will leave\r\n     you to judge of his general character, etc. He and his mother\r\n     are now on their way to Lawrence, and they expect to be at\r\n     your house about the 6th (July). They intend to remain about\r\n     two weeks. When I saw them getting into the train, and knew\r\n     that in a few days they would be with you, I wanted very much\r\n     to accompany them. But mother says _one_ noisy boy in the\r\n     house is sufficient. (I wonder whether she means you or\r\n     James!) But as soon as they have ended their visit, if\r\n     nothing happens, you may expect to see our family landing\r\n     from the Julia Burton, some fine morning. I have been pent up\r\n     in the city now almost six months, and I am impatient to get\r\n     into the country again--especially among the trout-streams\r\n     about your quiet little village.\r\n\r\n     I have often thought of the sport we had the day we went up\r\n     to Dungeon Brook. I know it rained hard, but the string of\r\n     trout we caught beat any thing of the kind I ever happened to\r\n     see.\r\n\r\n     But I've got some good news for you. Father has decided to\r\n     spend part of the winter at Uncle Joe's, and he promises to\r\n     take you and me with him; so you can begin to pack up your\r\n     duds as soon as you wish.\r\n\r\n     That trout-pole you made for me last winter met with a\r\n     serious accident a few days since. One of my schoolmates\r\n     invited me to go up the river with him, and try a perch-bed\r\n     he had accidentally discovered. I had sent off my heavy pole\r\n     to the painters, so I was obliged to take my trout-pole. I\r\n     was afraid that I should break it, but it behaved beautifully\r\n     for about two hours, during which time I drew in sixty fine\r\n     perch and rock-bass--some of the former weighing between one\r\n     and two pounds--and I began to think that the pole was too\r\n     tough to break. But I was very soon convinced of my mistake,\r\n     for, as bad luck would have it, I hooked on to a black-bass.\r\n     I thought I handled him very carefully, but, before we could\r\n     land him, he broke my pole in three pieces; but the line\r\n     held, and he was soon floundering in the boat. He was a fine\r\n     fellow--a regular \"sockdologer\"--weighing six pounds and a\r\n     half. But I heartily wished him safe in the bottom of the\r\n     river. I have laid the pole away, and intend to bring it to\r\n     you for repairs.\r\n\r\n     But it is ten o'clock, and father suggests that, if I wish to\r\n     get to the post-office before the mail closes, I had \"better\r\n     make tracks.\" So I must stop. Love to all.\r\n\r\n     Yours affectionately,               A. Winters.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--Please tell Ben and Harry that I will answer their\r\n     letters immediately. A.W.\r\n\r\nBy this time the rest of the smugglers had arrived, and, as soon as\r\nFrank had run his eye over the letter, and began to fold it up, George\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n\"Well, what does he say? Did he receive Harry's letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and also one from Ben. He says he will answer them at once.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments' conversation, the boys separated, and started for\r\nhome, expressing themselves highly delighted at Frank's way of\r\nspending the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThe day on which Mrs. Sherman and her son were expected at length\r\narrived. As a fine breeze was blowing, Frank and his sister--accompanied,\r\nof course, by Brave--stepped into the Speedwell, and started to enjoy a\r\nsail on the river.\r\n\r\nIt was now the summer vacation, and the boys were determined to have\r\nplenty of recreation after their long siege of study; and, when Frank\r\nreached the mouth of the creek, he found the river dotted with white\r\nsails as far as he could see. Several of the boats had started on\r\nfishing excursions, but the majority of them were sailing idly about,\r\nas if nothing particular had been determined on.\r\n\r\nFrank turned the Speedwell's head down the river, and soon joined the\r\nlittle fleet. He had hoisted every stitch of canvas his boat could\r\ncarry, and she flew along, passing several of the swiftest vessels,\r\nand finally encountered the Alert. The race was short, for the\r\nSpeedwell easily passed her, and George and Harry were compelled to\r\nacknowledge that, to use their own expression, \"the Alert was\r\nnowhere.\"\r\n\r\nIn about two hours the Julia Burton was seen rounding the point, and a\r\nloud, clear whistle warned the villagers of her approach. Frank turned\r\nthe Speedwell toward home, and arrived at the wharf about ten minutes\r\nafter the steamer had landed.\r\n\r\nAs they sailed along up the creek, Julia suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"I wonder who those people are!\"\r\n\r\nFrank turned, and saw a lady just getting into a carriage, and a boy,\r\napparently about his own age, stood by, giving orders, in a loud\r\nvoice, to the driver, about their baggage. Both were dressed in the\r\nhight of fashion, and Frank knew, from the description his aunt had\r\ngiven his mother, that they were the expected visitors.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boy had satisfied himself that their baggage was safe,\r\nhe continued, in a voice loud enough to be heard by Frank and his\r\nsister,\r\n\r\n\"Now, driver, you're sure you know where Mrs. Nelson lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the man, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, old beeswax, hurry up. Show us how fast your cobs can\r\ntravel.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he sprang into the carriage, and the driver closed the door\r\nafter him, mounted to his seat, and drove off.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Julia, in surprise, \"I guess that's Aunt Harriet--don't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered her brother, \"I know it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I shall not like James,\" continued Julia; \"he talks too\r\nloud.\"\r\n\r\nFrank did not answer, for he was of the same opinion. He had inferred\r\nfrom Archie's letter that James would prove any thing but an agreeable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe brisk wind that was blowing carried them rapidly along, and, in a\r\nfew moments, they came to a place where the road ran along close to\r\nthe creek. The distance to Mrs. Nelson's, by the road, was greater, by\r\na quarter of a mile, than by the creek, and, consequently, they had\r\ngained considerably on the carriage. Soon they heard the rattling of\r\nwheels behind them, and the hack came suddenly around a turn in the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nJames was leaning half-way out of the window, his cap pushed on one\r\nside of his head, and, not knowing Frank, he accosted him, as he came\r\nup, with his favorite expression.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, old beeswax! Saw-logs must have been cheap when you had that\r\nboat built. You've got timber enough there to finish off a good-sized\r\nbarn.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, of course, made no reply; and, in a moment more, the hack was\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the wharf, in front of the house, and Frank helped\r\nJulia out, and, after making his boat fast, started toward the house,\r\nand entered the room where their visitors were seated.\r\n\r\nHis aunt's greeting was cold and distant, and she acted as if her\r\nevery motion had been thoroughly studied. James's acknowledgment was\r\nscarcely more than agreeable. To Frank's inquiry, \"How do you do,\r\nsir?\" he replied,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm bully, thank you, old beeswax. Not you the cod I twigged[A]\r\nnavigating that scow up the creek?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Saw.]\r\n\r\nFrank acknowledged himself to be the person, and James continued,\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she's the champion yacht, isn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, \"she is. There's no boat about the village that\r\ncan beat her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, possibly; but, after all, you had better tell that to the\r\nmarines. I've seen too much of the world to have a country chap stuff\r\nme, now I tell you, old beeswax.\"\r\n\r\nWe will not particularize upon James's visit. It will suffice to\r\nrelate one or two incidents that will illustrate his character.\r\n\r\nA day or two after his arrival, he discovered the schooner standing on\r\nFrank's bureau, and he could not be contented until he should see \"how\r\nshe carried herself in the water,\" and Frank, reluctantly, carried it\r\ndown to the creek and set it afloat.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments James seemed to have forgotten his evil\r\npropensities, and they amused themselves by sailing the schooner from\r\none side of the creek to the other. But he very soon grew tired of\r\nthis \"lame, unexciting sport,\" as he called it, and, gathering up an\r\narmful of stones, he began to throw them into the water near the\r\nboat, shouting,\r\n\r\n\"Storm on the Atlantic! See her rock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't, James,\" urged Frank; \"I'm afraid you will hit the\r\nschooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" answered James, confidently, still continuing to\r\nthrow the stones; \"I can come within a hair's-breadth of her, and not\r\ntouch her. Now, see.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, before Frank could speak, away flew a large stone, with great\r\nforce, and, crashing through the mainsail of the little vessel, broke\r\nboth masts and the bowsprit short off.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" exclaimed Frank, \"I was afraid you would do that.\"\r\n\r\nJames did not appear to be in the least sorry for it, but he skipped\r\nup the bank, shouting, in an insulting tone,\r\n\r\n\"There's your boat, old beeswax. When do you expect her in port?\"\r\n\r\nFrank did not answer, but drew what remained of the schooner to the\r\nshore, and, taking it under his arm, started for his shop, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Now, that's a nice cousin for a fellow to have. I'll do my best to\r\ntreat him respectfully while he stays, but I shall not be sorry when\r\nthe time comes to bid him good-by.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that time was not far distant. James often complained to his\r\nmother that Frank was a \"low-minded, mean fellow,\" and urged an\r\nimmediate departure. His mother always yielded to his requests, or\r\nrather _demands_, no matter how unreasonable they might be; and they\r\nhad scarcely made a visit of a week, when they announced their\r\nintention of leaving Lawrence by the \"next boat.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day previous to their departure, Mrs. Nelson had occasion to\r\nsend Frank to the village for some groceries, and, as a favorable wind\r\nwas blowing, he decided to go in his boat. But, before starting, he\r\nmanaged to slip away from James long enough to write a few lines to\r\nArchie, urging him to come immediately.\r\n\r\nFrank intended to start off without James's knowledge; but the uneasy\r\nfellow was always on the look-out, and, seeing his cousin going\r\nrapidly down the walk, with a basket on each arm, and his dog--which,\r\nlike his master, had not much affection for James--he shouted,\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, old beeswax, where are you bound for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the village,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to take the tow-path?\"\r\n\r\n\"The tow-path! I don't know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to ride shanks' horses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand that, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are a bass-wood man, indeed,\" said James, with a taunting\r\nlaugh. \"Are you going to _walk_? Do you think you can comprehend me\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, \"I can understand you when you talk English.\r\nNo, I am not going to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go with you, if you will leave that dog at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what objections you can have to his company. He always\r\ngoes with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you think more of him than you do of your relations; but\r\nI'm going with you, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he quickened his pace to overtake Frank.\r\n\r\nWhile his cousin was hoisting the sails, James deliberately seated\r\nhimself in the stern of the boat, and took hold of the tiller.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand managing a sail-boat?\" inquired Frank, as he stood\r\nready to cast off the painter.\r\n\r\n\"If any one else had asked me that question,\" answered James, with an\r\nair of injured dignity, \"I should have considered it an insult. Of\r\ncourse I _do_.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" said Frank, as he pushed the boat from the wharf.\r\n\"Go ahead. We shall be obliged to tack a good many times, going down\r\nbut we can sail back like a book, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you teach your grandmother, will you?\" interrupted James. \"I've\r\nsailed more boats than you ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, at first, did not doubt the truth of this assertion, for James\r\nlived in a seaport town, and had had ample opportunity to learn how to\r\nmanage a yacht; but they had not made twenty feet from the wharf, when\r\nhe made up his mind that his cousin had never before attempted to act\r\nas skipper.\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping as close as possible to the wind, as he should have\r\ndone, he turned the boat's head first one way and then another, and,\r\nof course, made no headway at all.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw such a tub as this,\" said James, at length; \"I can't make\r\nher mind her helm.\"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a strong gust of wind filled the sails, and, as\r\nJames was not seaman enough to \"luff\" or \"let go the sheet,\" the\r\nSpeedwell same very near capsizing. As she righted, the wind again\r\nfilled the sails, and the boat was driven with great speed toward the\r\nshore. Frank had barely time to pull up the center-board before her\r\nbows ran high upon the bank, and the sheet was roughly jerked from\r\nJames's hand, and flapped loudly against the mast.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Frank, turning to his cousin, who sat, pale with terror,\r\n\"I guess it's a long time since you attempted to sail a boat; you seem\r\nto have forgotten how, I tell you,\" he continued as he noticed\r\nJames's trepidation, \"if I hadn't pulled up that center-board just as\r\nI did, we should have been obliged to swim for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't swim,\" said James, in a weak voice.\r\n\r\n\"Then you would have been in a fix,\" said Frank. \"Now, let me see if I\r\ncan have any better luck.\"\r\n\r\nJames very willingly seated himself on one of the middle thwarts, and\r\nFrank pushed the boat from the shore, and took hold of the tiller,\r\nand, under his skillful management, the Speedwell flew through the\r\nwater like a duck.\r\n\r\nJames soon got over his fright, and his uneasy nature would not allow\r\nhim to remain long inactive, and, as he could find nothing else to do,\r\nhe commenced to rock the boat from one side to the other, and, as she\r\nwas \"heeling\" considerably, under the weight of her heavy canvas, the\r\nwater began to pour in over her side. Although the speed of the boat\r\nwas greatly diminished, Frank, for some time, made no complaint,\r\nhoping that his cousin would soon grow tired of the sport. But James\r\ndid not seem inclined to cease, and Frank, at length, began to\r\nremonstrate.\r\n\r\nHe reminded James that it would not require much to capsize the boat,\r\nand, as the creek was very deep, and as he (James) had said he could\r\nnot swim, he might be a \"gone sucker.\"\r\n\r\nThis, at first, had the effect of making James more careful, but he\r\nsoon commenced again as bad as ever.\r\n\r\nBrave was seated in his usual place, and directly behind James. He\r\nseemed to dislike the rocking of the boat as much as his master, but\r\nhe bore it very patiently for awhile, thinking, no doubt, that the\r\nbest way to deal with James was to \"let him severely alone.\" But the\r\nrocking increased, and Brave began to slide from one side of the boat\r\nto the other. This was enough to upset his patience; and, encouraged,\r\nperhaps, by some sly glances from Frank, he sprang up, and, placing a\r\npaw on each shoulder of his tormentor, barked fiercely, close to his\r\near.\r\n\r\nJames screamed loudly; and Brave, evidently thinking he had punished\r\nhim enough, returned to his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Let me ashore,\" shouted James; \"I shan't stay in here any longer.\"\r\n\r\nFrank gladly complied, and, the moment the Speedwell's bows touched\r\nthe bank, James sprang out.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't risk my life in that tub again for any money,\" he shouted;\r\n\"you may bet on that, old beeswax.\"\r\n\r\nFrank made no reply, but pushed the boat from the shore again as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nJames now felt safe; and, gathering up a handful of stones,\r\ndetermined to wreak his vengeance on Brave. The sensible\r\nNewfoundlander, at first, paid no attention to this cowardly assault;\r\nbut the stones whizzed by in unpleasant proximity, now and then\r\nstriking the sail or the side of the boat, and he began to manifest\r\nhis displeasure, by showing his teeth and growling savagely.\r\n\r\nFrank stood it as long as possible, knowing that the best plan was to\r\nremain silent; but James continued to follow the boat, and the stones\r\nstruck all around the object of his vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't do that,\" said Frank, at length.\r\n\r\n\"You do, eh?\" said James. \"How are you going to hinder it? But perhaps\r\nyou would rather have me throw at you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, picking up a large stone, he hurled it at his cousin with great\r\nforce. It fell into the creek, close to the boat, and splashed the\r\nwater all over Frank.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to enrage Brave more than ever, and he sprang into the\r\nwater, and swam toward the shore, and no amount of scolding on Frank's\r\npart could induce him to return. James, fearing that he was about to\r\nbe punished in a way he had not thought of, turned and took to his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a loud shout was heard, and several boys sprang over\r\nthe fence into the road, and James was speedily overtaken and\r\nsurrounded. They were a ragged, hard-looking set of fellows, and Frank\r\nknew that they were the Hillers; besides, he recognized the foremost\r\nof them as Lee Powell. They had their fishing-rods on their shoulders,\r\nand each boy carried in his hand a long string of trout.\r\n\r\n\"Look'e here, you spindle-shanked dandy,\" said Lee, striding up and\r\nlaying hold of James's collar with no friendly hand, \"does yer know\r\nwho yer was a heavin' rocks at? Shall we punch him for yer?\" he added,\r\nturning to Frank.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Frank; \"let him go; he's my cousin.\"\r\n\r\nLee accordingly released him, and James said, in a scarcely audible\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n\"I was only in fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, only playin', was yer?\" said Lee; \"that alters the case\r\n'tirely--don't it, Pete?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy appealed to nodded his assent, and Lee continued,\r\n\r\n\"We thought yer was in blood arnest. If yer _had_ been, we wouldn't a\r\nleft a grease-spot of yer--would we, Pete?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty cl'ar of us,\" answered Pete.\r\n\r\nAs soon as James found himself at liberty, he started toward home at\r\nfull speed, hardly daring to look behind him. Brave had by this time\r\ngained the shore, and was about to start in pursuit, but a few sharp\r\nwords from Frank restrained him.\r\n\r\n\"Whar are yer goin'?\" inquired Lee, walking carelessly down the bank.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to the village,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Will yer give a feller a ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Jump in.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hillers accordingly clambered into the boat, and, in a few\r\nmoments, they reached the wharf, at the back of the post-office.\r\n\r\nLee and his companions immediately sprang out, and walked off, without\r\nsaying a word; and Frank, after fastening his boat to the wharf, began\r\nto pull down the sails, when he discovered that the Hillers had left\r\ntwo large strings of trout behind them.\r\n\r\nHastily catching them up, he ran around the corner of the post-office,\r\nand saw Lee and his followers, some distance up the road.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" he shouted, at the top of his lungs; \"Lee Powell!\"\r\n\r\nBut they paid no attention to him.\r\n\r\n\"I know they heard me,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd he shouted again, but with no better success.\r\n\r\nAt length, one of the village boys, who was coming across the fields,\r\nwith a basket of strawberries on his arm, shouted to the Hillers,\r\nand, when he had gained their attention, pointed toward Frank,\r\n\r\n\"See here!\" Frank shouted, as he held up the fish; \"you have forgotten\r\nthese.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess not,\" shouted Lee, in reply. \"We Hillers don't forget\r\nfavors as easy as all that comes to. Ye're welcome to 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he and his companions walked rapidly off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTrout-Fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the events related in the preceding chapter\r\ntranspired, Frank, with one or two companions, was standing in the\r\npost-office, waiting for the opening of the mail. The steamer had just\r\nlanded, and the passengers which she had brought were slowly walking\r\ntoward the hotel, where they intended to take dinner. At length, a\r\nvillage hack came rapidly down the road leading from the wharf, and,\r\nwhen it came opposite the post-office, a head was suddenly thrust out\r\nat the window, the driver reined in his horses, the door flew open,\r\nand Archie Winters sprang out.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to describe the meeting of the cousins, nor the\r\njoy that prevailed among the village boys at the arrival of their city\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nArchie had not written that it was his intention to come so soon, and\r\nhis sudden appearance among them took them completely by surprise.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments' conversation, Frank and Archie got into the\r\ncarriage, and, in a short time, were set down at the door of Mrs.\r\nNelson's house.\r\n\r\nFrank's mother and sister expressed much joy at Archie's arrival, and,\r\nafter the excitement of meeting was over, they inquired after his\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\"When are they coming?\" asked Frank.\r\n\r\n\"They intended to come in the fall,\" answered Archie, \"but father has\r\nmore business on his hands than he expected, and they may not be here\r\nbefore the holidays; but I couldn't wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't,\" said Frank. \"You are not going home before\r\nspring, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Archie, \"I'm going to stay as long as you will keep me.\"\r\n\r\nFrank was overjoyed at this, and, if he had not been in the house, he\r\nwould have given, as he said, \"a yell that would have done credit to\r\nan Indian.\"\r\n\r\nBut, before going further, we must say a word about Archie's\r\ncompanions--we mean his dogs. One of them, that answered to the name\r\nof Sport, was as fine a fox-hound as one would wish to see. He was a\r\nlarge, tan-colored animal, very fleet and courageous, and was well\r\nacquainted with all the tricks of his favorite game, and the boys\r\noften boasted that \"Sport had never lost a fox in his life.\" The black\r\nfox, which had held possession of Reynard's Island so long, was\r\ncaptured by Frank and his cousin, with the assistance of Sport, after\r\na chase of three hours. Lightfoot--for that was the name of the\r\nother--was an English grayhound. He stood full three feet high at the\r\nshoulders, and his speed was tremendous. He was young, however, and\r\nknew nothing about hunting; but he had been taught to \"fetch and\r\ncarry,\" and, as he learned very readily, the boys expected plenty of\r\nsport in training him.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, Archie's trunk was carried into the \"study,\" and the\r\nboys busied themselves in taking out its contents. The clothing was\r\nall packed away in the bureau; and then came Archie's \"sporting\r\ncabinet,\" as he called it--a fine double-barreled shot-gun, which was\r\nhung upon the frame at the foot of the bed; a quantity of ammunition,\r\na small hatchet, powder-flasks, shot bags, and a number of other\r\nthings, which were stowed away in safe places.\r\n\r\nAt length Archie drew out two fish-poles, neatly stowed away in strong\r\nbags, and one of them proved to be the one about which Archie had\r\nwritten. This was placed away in one corner, and Frank promised to\r\nmend it immediately.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Archie, as he drew out two queer-looking implements;\r\n\"I have been acting on the suggestion of Uncle Joe Lewis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" inquired Frank.\r\n\r\nOne of them was a thin rod of steel, about three feet in length, very\r\npointed and sharp at the end the other looked very much like a\r\nfish-spear, only the \"tines\" were smaller and sharper.\r\n\r\n\"They are spears,\" said Archie, in answer to Frank's question.\r\n\r\n\"So I see; but what use can you put them to?\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Archie, taking up the rod of steel, \"is a mink-spear.\r\nLast winter we lost a good many minks, when, if we had had an\r\ninstrument like this, we could have secured them easily enough. You\r\nknow that sometimes you get a mink into a place where you can see him,\r\nbut, if you go to work to chop a hole large enough to get a stick in\r\nto kill him, he will jump out before you know what you are about. You\r\nwill remember a little incident of this kind that happened last\r\nwinter--that day we had such good luck. We were following a mink up\r\nthe creek on the ice, when Brave suddenly stopped before a hollow\r\nstub, and stuck his nose into a hole, and acted as if there was a mink\r\nin there; and, you know, we didn't believe there was, but we thought\r\nwe could stop and see. So we cut a hole in the stub, and, sure enough,\r\nthere was a mink, and, as good luck would have it, we had cut the hole\r\nclose to the place where he was, and we thought we had him sure; and,\r\nwhile Harry Butler went to cut a stick to kill him with, I chopped the\r\nhole a little larger, so that we could see him plainer, when, all of a\r\nsudden, out popped the mink, and, before we could say 'scat,' it was\r\nunder the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, \"I remember it very well; and, I guess, there were\r\nsome mad boys around that place, somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Archie, \"I was provoked because it was all my fault that\r\nwe lost him. If we had had this spear, we could have killed him easy\r\nenough. We wouldn't be obliged to cut a hole larger than an inch\r\nsquare, and no mink I ever saw could get through that. And this,\" he\r\ncontinued, taking up the other instrument, \"is a muskrat-spear. The\r\nway to proceed is this: Go to a muskrat's house, and, with an ax, cut\r\na chunk out of the top, directly over where they sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, by the time you get that done,\" said Frank, with a laugh, \"the\r\nmuskrats will be out of your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that; they will undoubtedly start off the first blow you\r\nstrike, and swim to some breathing-hole; but in a quarter of an hour\r\nthey will be sure to return. While they are gone, you will have plenty\r\nof time to cut the chunk, and, after taking it out, place it carefully\r\nback, in such a manner that it can be removed instantly; then, if\r\nthere are any other houses near, serve them in the same way. Then, in\r\nhalf an hour or so, take your spear and go to the houses, making as\r\nlittle noise at possible, and let your companion lift out the chunk\r\nsuddenly, and you be ready to strike. Father says he has seen Uncle\r\nJoe Lewis catch half a dozen in one house, in this way, very\r\nfrequently. He always spears the one nearest the passage that leads\r\nfrom the house down into the water, and this will prevent the others\r\nfrom escaping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't much like the idea,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Archie. \"It will do well enough for those who\r\nmake their living by hunting; but, if I want to hunt muskrats, I would\r\nrather wait until the ice breaks up, in spring; I can then shoot them\r\nquite fast enough to suit me, and the sport is more exciting.\"\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a week after Archie's arrival, they arose, as\r\nusual, very early, and, while they were dressing, Frank drew aside the\r\ncurtain, and looked out.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Archie,\" he exclaimed, \"you've got your wish; it's a\r\nfirst-rate morning to go trout-fishing.\"\r\n\r\nArchie had been waiting impatiently for a cloudy day; he was very fond\r\nof trout-fishing, and he readily agreed to his cousin's proposal to\r\n\"take a trip to Dungeon Brook,\" and they commenced pulling on their\r\n\"hunting and fishing rig,\" as they called it, which consisted of a\r\npair of stout pantaloons that would resist water and dirt to the last\r\nextremity, heavy boots reaching above their knees, and a blue flannel\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\nWhile Archie was getting their fishing-tackle ready, Frank busied\r\nhimself in placing on the table in the kitchen such eatables as he\r\ncould lay his hands on, for he and his cousin were the only ones up.\r\n\r\nTheir breakfast was eaten in a hurry; and, after drawing on their\r\nIndia-rubber coats--for Frank said it would rain before they\r\nreturned--they slung on their fish-baskets, and took their trout-poles\r\nin their hands, and started out.\r\n\r\nDungeon Brook lay about five miles distant, through the woods. It was\r\na long tramp, over fallen logs and through thick bushes; but it was\r\nfamous for its large trout, and the boys knew they would be well\r\nrepaid for their trouble.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours they arrived at their destination; and, after\r\npartaking of a lunch, which Frank had brought, they rigged their\r\n\"flies,\" and Archie went up the brook a little distance, to try a\r\nplace known among the boys as the \"old trout-hole,\" while Frank\r\ndropped his hook down close to a large log that lay across the stream,\r\nnear the place where he was standing. The bait sank slowly toward the\r\nbottom, when, suddenly, there was a tremendous jerk, and the line\r\nwhizzed through the water with a force that bent the tough, elastic\r\npole like a \"reed shaken with the wind.\" Frank was a skillful\r\nfisherman, and, after a few moments' maneuvering, a trout weighing\r\nbetween three and four pounds lay floundering on the bank.\r\n\r\nArchie soon came up, having been a little more successful, as two\r\ngood-sized fish were struggling in his basket.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly down the brook, stopping now and then to try some\r\nfavorite spot, and, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they reached\r\nthe place where the brook emptied into Glen's Creek, and were about\r\ntwo miles from home. They had been remarkably successful; their\r\nbaskets were filled, and they had several \"sockdologers\" strung on a\r\nbranch, which they carried in their hands.\r\n\r\nAfter dropping their hooks for a few moments among the perch, at the\r\nmouth of the brook, they unjointed their poles, and started toward\r\nhome, well satisfied with their day's work.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as Frank and Archie were on their way to the village, on\r\nfoot--the wind being contrary, they could not sail--they met George\r\nand Harry, who had started to pay them a visit.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, boys!\" exclaimed the former, as soon as they came within\r\nspeaking distance, \"we've got news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And some that you will not like to hear, Frank,\" said Harry, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you know, Charley Morgan, some time since, sent to New York for\r\na couple of sail-boats, a sloop and schooner. They arrived yesterday,\r\nand he thinks they are something great, and says the Speedwell is\r\nnowhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" chimed in Harry, \"he said, when those boats came, he would show\r\nus 'country chaps' some sailing that would make us open our eyes; but,\r\ncome to find out, they are perfect tubs. I saw the sloop coming up the\r\ncreek, and she made poor headway. The Alert can beat her all hollow,\r\nwith only the foresail hoisted.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation the boys had been walking toward the village,\r\nand, in a few moments, they reached the dock behind the post-office,\r\nwhere the two new boats lay. One of them was a short, \"dumpy,\"\r\nsloop-rigged boat, with no deck or center-board, and the other was a\r\nbeautifully-modeled schooner.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of them?\" inquired Harry, after they had regarded\r\nthem several moments.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Archie, \"I have seen a good many boats like these in\r\nNew York, but I don't think they will do much here. That schooner may\r\nshow some fine sailing qualities, but that sloop will prove to be the\r\nslowest boat about the village; she is altogether too short. Take it\r\nwhere the waves are long and regular, and she will do well enough but\r\nhere in the river, where the waves are all chopped up, she can't\r\naccomplish much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your private opinion, expressed here in this public manner, is\r\nit?\" said a sneering voice. \"You have made a fine show of your\r\nignorance.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys turned, and saw Charles Morgan and several of the Rangers\r\nstanding close by.\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't know more about yachts than that,\" continued Charles,\r\n\"I'd go home and soak my head.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was greeted by the Rangers with a loud laugh; and Archie,\r\nwho, like Frank, was a very peaceable fellow, said,\r\n\r\n\"Every one to his own way of thinking, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" answered Charles; \"but, if I was as much of a blockhead\r\nas you are, I'd be careful to keep my thoughts to myself.\"\r\n\r\nArchie did not answer, for he knew it would only add fuel to the fire;\r\nfor Charles's actions indicated that he was bent on getting up a\r\nquarrel. He had determined to make another attempt to \"settle\r\naccounts\" between himself and Frank.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you fifty dollars,\" said Charles, \"that there are not half a\r\ndozen boats about the village that can beat that sloop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not in the habit of betting,\" answered Archie; \"but, if you will\r\nfind a boat about the village that _can't_ beat her, I'll eat your\r\nsloop.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are green, indeed,\" said Charles. \"Now, what do you suppose that\r\nsloop cost me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Archie, thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, \"I\r\nthink ten dollars would foot the bill.\"\r\n\r\nArchie said this in so comical a manner that Frank and the others\r\ncould not refrain from laughing outright.\r\n\r\nCharles was angry in an instant, and, quick as thought, he sprang\r\nforward and seized Archie. But he soon discovered that he had\r\nundertaken more than he could accomplish; for his antagonist, though\r\nconsiderably smaller than himself, was possessed of enormous strength,\r\nand was as active as a cat, and he glided like an eel from Charles's\r\ngrasp, and, seizing him by both wrists, held him fast. After a few\r\ndesperate, but ineffectual, attempts to free himself, Charles shouted\r\nto the Rangers, who had been bustling about in a state of considerable\r\nexcitement, but very prudently keeping in the background,\r\n\r\n\"Help, help, you cowards!\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing could induce them to attempt the rescue.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a boat, which had entered the creek unnoticed by the\r\nboys, drew up to the dock, and a strong, cheery voice, called out,\r\n\r\n\"Hang on to him, little fellow--hang on to him. We've got a few little\r\nmatters to settle up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Leo Powell came running toward them, with half a dozen of his\r\nragged followers close at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me go,\" cried Charles, turning very pale, and writhing and\r\ntwisting in the strong grasp that held him; \"I'll be civil to you\r\nafter this, only don't let them get hold of me; they will half kill\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nArchie accordingly released his captive, but the Hillers were so close\r\nto him that Charles dare not run, and he remained close to Frank for\r\nprotection, while the rest of the Rangers beat a precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Pete, hold my coat,\" said Lee, tossing his tattered garment to\r\none of his companions; \"I'll show this Cap'n Regulator that some folks\r\nare as good as others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he advanced toward Charles, and commenced rolling up his sleeves.\r\n\r\n\"No, Lee,\" said Frank, placing himself before the frightened Ranger,\r\n\"you mustn't touch him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mustn't touch him!\" repeated Lee, in surprise. \"Why, wasn't he jest\r\ntryin' to wallop your friend here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's able to defend himself,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Then he's all right. But I haven't paid for trying to Regulate me,\r\nthat night.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't do it, did he?\" inquired Frank.\r\n\r\n\"No, 'cause you fellows wouldn't let him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, we don't want you to whip him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, if you say so, I won't; but he oughter be larnt better\r\nmanners--hadn't he, Pete?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Course,\" was Pete's laconic answer.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Charley,\" said Archie, \"you may take yourself off as soon as you\r\nwish; they will not hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not this time,\" said Lee, shaking his hard fist in Charles's face;\r\n\"but we may come acrost you some time when you hasn't nobody to stand\r\nup for you; then you had better look out--hadn't he, Pete?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't he, though!\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nCharles did not need any urging, and he was quickly out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see you jest a minit, Frank,\" said Lee, as the former was\r\nabout to move away.\r\n\r\nFrank drew off on one side, and the Hiller continued,\r\n\r\n\"I promised I'd allers be a friend to you fellers that stood up for me\r\nthat night, and I want to let you see that I haven't forgot my\r\npromise. I know that I can't do much for you, but I jest want to show\r\nyou that I allers remember favors.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned, and made a motion to one of his companions, who darted\r\noff to the boat, and soon returned, bringing a young otter in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"I allers heerd,\" continued Lee, as his companion came up, \"that you\r\nhave a reg'lar hankerin' arter ketchin' and tamin' wild varmints. Now,\r\nwe want you to take this as a present from us. I know it ain't much,\r\nbut, arter all, a young otter is a thing a feller can't ketch every\r\nday. Will you take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" answered Frank, as he took the little animal in his arms.\r\n\"I have long wished for an otter, and I thank--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there,\" interrupted Lee. \"Keep your thanks for them as needs\r\nthem, or likes to hear 'em. We Hillers have got feelings as well as\r\nany body. It's our way of bringin' up that makes us so bad. Now,\r\ngood-by; and, if you ever want any thing, jest call on Lee Powell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he and his companions walked rapidly toward their boat, and soon\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nA Deer-Hunt on the Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, Frank and his cousin, accompanied\r\nby the dogs, got into the skiff, and pulled up the creek, on a\r\n\"prospecting expedition.\" They had started for the swamp, which lay\r\nabout two miles and a half from the cottage, to see what the prospects\r\nwere for a good muskrat-hunt in the spring. This swamp covered,\r\nperhaps, five hundred acres, and near its center was a small lake,\r\nwhich emptied into Glen's Creek.\r\n\r\nA few moments' pulling brought them to this lake, and Frank, who was\r\nseated at the helm, turned the boat's head toward a high point that\r\nprojected for some distance out into the lake, and behind which a\r\nlittle bay set back into the land. This point was the only high land\r\nabout the swamp, and stretched away back into the woods for several\r\nmiles. It was a favorite place for sunfish and perch; and the boys\r\nlanded, and were rigging their poles, intending to catch some for\r\ntheir dinner, when they heard a strange noise, that seemed to come\r\nfrom the bay behind the point. They knew in a moment that it was made\r\nby a duck, but still it was a sound they had never heard before, and,\r\nhunter-like, they determined to discover where it came from. So,\r\nreaching for their guns, they crawled carefully through the bushes,\r\nuntil they came within sight of the bay. A brood of young ducks, under\r\nthe direction of two old ones, were sporting about among the broad\r\nleaves of the water-lilies. They had never seen any like them before;\r\nbut Frank knew in a moment, from descriptions he had often read, that\r\nthey were eider-ducks, and he determined, if possible, to capture some\r\nof the young ones, which, he noticed, were but half-fledged, and too\r\nsmall to fly. But the question was how to proceed. If the ducklings\r\ncould not fly, they could swim like a streak; and he knew that, the\r\nmoment they were alarmed, they would either make for the opposite side\r\nof the bay or for the lake, and, if they succeeded in reaching the\r\nopen water, he might whistle for his ducks.\r\n\r\nHis only chance was to corner them in the bay; they would then be\r\nobliged to hide among the lilies, and perhaps they might succeed in\r\ncapturing some of them.\r\n\r\nHurriedly whispering to his cousin, they crept back to the skiff,\r\npulled around the point, and entered the bay. The moment they came in\r\nsight, the old ones uttered their cries of warning, took to wing, and\r\nflew out over the lake, and, as they had expected, the young ones\r\ndarted in among the lilies, and were out of sight in an instant. But\r\nthe boys had kept their eyes open, and knew about where to look for\r\nthem; and, after half an hour's chase, they succeeded in securing\r\nthree of them with the dip-net.\r\n\r\nAfter tying them up in their caps, Frank pulled leisurely along out of\r\nthe bay, and was just entering the lake, when Archie, who was\r\nsteering, suddenly turned the boat toward the shore, and said, in a\r\nscarcely audible whisper,\r\n\r\n\"A deer--a deer! sure as I live!\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked in the direction his cousin indicated, and saw a large\r\nbuck standing in the edge of the water, not twenty rods from them.\r\nLuckily he had not heard their approach, and Frank drew the boat\r\ncloser under the point, to watch his motions.\r\n\r\nThey were a good deal excited, and Archie's hand trembled like a leaf,\r\nas he reached for his gun.\r\n\r\nAnother lucky circumstance was, that the dogs had not discovered him.\r\nBrave and Hunter could have been kept quiet, but Lightfoot was not\r\nsufficiently trained to be trusted.\r\n\r\nThe boys determined to make an effort to capture him; he would make a\r\nsplendid addition to their museum. Besides, they had never killed a\r\ndeer, and now the opportunity was fairly before them. But the question\r\nwas how to proceed. The buck was out of range of their shot-guns, and\r\nthey knew it would be worse than useless to fire at him; so they\r\nconcluded to lie still in the boat, and await the movements of the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nThe buck was standing in the water, up to his knees, deliberately\r\ncropping the leaves of the lilies, and now and then gazing toward the\r\nopposite shore, as if he were meditating upon something. At length he\r\nappeared to have decided upon his course, for he waded deeper into the\r\nwater, and swam boldly out into the lake.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what the boys had wished for; and, when the buck had\r\nmade about ten rods from the shore, Archie took his seat at the oars,\r\nand pulled the boat silently out from behind the point. The moment\r\nthey entered the lake, Lightfoot discovered the game, and uttered a\r\nloud bark. The buck heard it, and his first impulse was to turn and\r\nregain the shore he had just left. But Archie gave way on the oars\r\nmanfully, and succeeded in intercepting him; and the buck, finding\r\nhimself fairly cut off, uttered a loud snort, and, seeming to\r\nunderstand that his only chance for escape was straight ahead, he\r\nsettled himself down in the water, and struck out again for the\r\nopposite shore.\r\n\r\nThe dogs now all broke out into a continuous barking, and Archie\r\nexclaimed, in an excited voice,\r\n\r\n\"Shoot him! shoot him!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is too far off,\" answered Frank. \"You must remember that our guns\r\nare loaded with small shot. Give way lively!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys very soon discovered that they had no easy task before them.\r\nThe light skiff, propelled by Archie's powerful strokes, danced\r\nrapidly over the little waves; but the buck was a fast swimmer and\r\nmade headway through the water astonishingly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't we gain on him any?\" inquired Archie, panting hard from his\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a very little,\" answered Frank. \"But he swims like a streak.\"\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the middle of the lake, and Frank, to his\r\ndelight, discovered that they were gaining rapidly. Archie redoubled\r\nhis efforts, and a few more strokes brought them close alongside of\r\nthe buck, which snorted aloud in his terror, and leaped half-way out\r\nof the water, then settled down nobly to his work.\r\n\r\nHad Frank been an experienced deer-hunter, he would have been very\r\ncareful not to approach the game in that manner; for a deer, when he\r\nfinds himself unable to escape, will fight most desperately, and his\r\nsharp antlers and hoofs, which will cut like a knife, are weapons not\r\nto be despised. But Frank, in his excitement, did not step to think of\r\nthis, and, letting go the tiller, he seized his gun, and fired both\r\nbarrels in quick succession. But the shot was not fatal; and the buck,\r\nmaddened with pain, leaped almost entirely out of the water.\r\n\r\nFrank now saw their danger, and, seizing the oars, attempted to turn\r\nthe boat out of the reach of the wounded animal; but it was too late,\r\nfor the buck, in his struggles, placed his fore-feet in the bow of the\r\nskiff, and overturned it in an instant, and boys, dogs, ducks, and\r\nall, were emptied into the cold waters of the lake. When they rose to\r\nthe surface, they found the skiff right side up, and dancing over the\r\nwaves they had made, and the ducks and oars were floating in the water\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nTheir first thought was to discover what had become of the buck; he\r\nand Brave were engaged in a most desperate fight, in which the dog was\r\nevidently getting the better of it. The hounds, probably not relishing\r\ntheir ducking, were making for the nearest shore, as if their lives\r\ndepended upon the issue.\r\n\r\nFrank swam up to the skiff, and took hold of it, to keep himself\r\nafloat; but Archie picked up an oar, and struck out toward the buck,\r\nexclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'd better take a hand in this fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Frank, quickly, \"you had better keep away from him; he\r\nhas too much strength left. He would beat you down under the water in\r\nless than a minute. Brave can manage him alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment Frank happened to think of his gun. Where was it? He\r\ndrew himself up and looked into the canoe. It was not there; it was at\r\nthe bottom of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Archie,\" he exclaimed, \"we've lost our guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just my luck,\" answered his cousin, bitterly. \"Now, I'll have revenge\r\nfor that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, swimming around behind the buck, out of reach of his dangerous\r\nhoofs, he raised himself in the water, and struck him a powerful blow,\r\nthat shivered the blade of the oar into fragments. It was a fatal\r\nblow; and the buck ceased his struggles, and lay motionless on the\r\nwater. It was a lucky circumstance for Brave that Archie had taken\r\npart in the fight, for the poor dog had experienced some pretty rough\r\nhandling. He had received several wounds from the sharp hoofs of the\r\nbuck, and there was a severe cut in his neck, from which the blood was\r\nflowing profusely; but the way he continued to shake the buck after\r\nArchie had dealt the fatal blow showed that there was plenty of fight\r\nleft in him. Frank carefully lifted him into the boat, and, by their\r\nunited efforts, after a good deal of hard work, the buck was thrown\r\nin after him. The boys then climbed in themselves, and Frank said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have captured our first deer, haven't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had never seen him,\" answered Archie. \"We've lost our guns\r\nby the operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid so; but we will, at least, make an attempt to recover\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will we go to work?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will dive for them.\"\r\n\r\nArchie shrugged his shoulders, but made no reply.\r\n\r\nFrank's first care was to bandage Brave's neck with his handkerchief.\r\nHe then divested himself of his clothes, and, after wringing the water\r\nout of them, he spread them out in the bow of the boat to dry.\r\n\r\n\"I don't much like the idea of going down in there,\" said Archie,\r\nlooking dubiously at the dark, muddy water; \"there may be snakes in\r\nit, or it may be full of logs, or the bottom may be covered with weeds\r\nthat will catch hold of a fellow's leg and keep him down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" said Frank; \"we must have the guns; I'd rather risk\r\nany thing than lose them. The only thing I am afraid of is that the\r\nwater is too deep. I'll be a little careful at first\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he lowered himself over the side of the boat, and, drawing\r\nin a long breath, sank slowly out of sight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Archie was pulling off his clothes, and, when his cousin\r\nappeared, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"How do things look down there? Rather muddy, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Frank, as he wiped the water from his face, \"but the\r\nbottom is all clear, and the water is only about fifteen feet deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see any thing of the guns?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I couldn't stay down long enough to make observations. I'm going\r\nto dive this time,\" he continued, as he commenced climbing back into\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here goes!\" said Archie.\r\n\r\nAnd, clasping his hands above his head, he dived out of sight, and\r\nFrank followed close after.\r\n\r\nWhen the latter again appeared at the surface, he found Archie holding\r\non to the boat, with one of the guns elevated above his head, to allow\r\nthe water to run out of the barrels.\r\n\r\nThe boys climbed up into the boat, and dived again, but neither of\r\nthem met with any success. The next time Archie was again the\r\nfortunate one, for, when Frank rose to the surface, he was climbing up\r\ninto the boat, with the other gun in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I don't call this a very unlucky hunt, after all,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Archie. \"I say, Frank,\" he continued, \"I wish we\r\ncould reproduce in our museum the scene we have just passed through.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I. If we could represent the buck in the act of upsetting us,\r\nit would be our 'masterpiece,' wouldn't it? But I am afraid that is\r\nfurther than our ingenuity extends.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys drew on their clothes, which were but partially dry, and,\r\nafter pulling ashore to get the hounds, which had kept up a loud\r\nbarking all the time, they turned the boat's head toward home.\r\n\r\nAfter changing their clothes and eating a hearty dinner--during which\r\nthey related their adventure to Mrs. Nelson and Julia--they carefully\r\nremoved the buck's skin, and hung it up in the shop by a fire to dry.\r\n\r\nTheir guns were found to be none the worse for their ducking; the\r\nloads, of course, were wet, and had to be drawn, but a good coat of\r\noil, and a thorough rubbing inside and out, made them look as good as\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, as the boys sat on the piazza in front of the\r\nhouse, talking over the events of the morning, their attention was\r\nattracted by a combat that was going on between one of Frank's pet\r\nkingbirds and a red-headed woodpecker. The latter was flying zigzag\r\nthrough the air, and the kingbird was pecking him most unmercifully.\r\nAt length the woodpecker took refuge in a tree that stood on the bank\r\nof the creek, and then seemed perfectly at his ease. He always kept on\r\nthe opposite side of the tree, and the kingbird, active as he was,\r\ncould not reach him. His loud, angry twittering soon brought his mate\r\nto his assistance, and then the woodpecker found himself between two\r\nfires. After trying in vain to elude them, he suddenly popped into a\r\nhole in the tree, and stuck out his long bill, as if defying them to\r\nenter. The kingbirds were completely outwitted; and, after making two\r\nor three angry darts at the hole in which their cunning enemy had\r\ntaken refuge, they settled down on the branches close by to wait until\r\nhe should show himself. They had no intention of giving up the\r\ncontest. The woodpecker seemed to take matters very coolly, and\r\nimproved his time by pounding away industriously on the inside of the\r\ntree. Occasionally he would thrust his head out of the hole, but,\r\nseeing his enemies still on the watch, he would dodge back, and go to\r\nwork again.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting fully a quarter of an hour for him to come out, and\r\nseeing that the kingbirds had no idea of \"raising the siege,\" Archie\r\nconcluded (to age his own expression) that he \"might as well lend a\r\nlittle assistance.\" So he ran round to the shop, and, having procured\r\nan ax, he went up to the tree, and dealt it a heavy blow. The next\r\nmoment the woodpecker flew out, and the kingbirds were after him in an\r\ninstant They followed him until he reached the woods, and then\r\nreturned to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nA 'Coon-Hunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might relate many more interesting events that transpired before\r\nthe hunting season set in; we might tell of the \"tall times\" the boys\r\nhad whipping the trout-streams, of the trials of speed that came off\r\non the river, when it turned out, as Archie had predicted, that\r\nCharles Morgan's sloop \"couldn't sail worth a row of pins;\" and we\r\nmight tell of many more desperate \"scrapes\" that came off between the\r\nbully and his sworn enemies the Hillers; but we fear, reader, you are\r\nalready weary of the Young Naturalist's home-life, and long to see him\r\nengaging in his favorite recreations--roaming through the woods, with\r\nhis gun on his shoulder, or dealing death among the ducks on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWell, autumn came at length; and, early one chilly, moonlight evening,\r\nFrank and his cousin, accompanied by George and Harry, might have\r\nbeen seen picking their way across the meadow at the back of Mrs.\r\nNelson's lot, and directing their course toward a large cornfield,\r\nthat lay almost in the edge of a piece of thick woods, about a quarter\r\nof a mile distant.\r\n\r\nThey had started on a 'coon-hunt. Frank and Harry, who were two of the\r\nbest shots in the village, were armed with their double-barreled\r\nshot-guns, and the others carried axes and lanterns.\r\n\r\nWe have said that it was a moonlight night, but, so far as a view of\r\nthe chase was concerned, the light of the moon would benefit them but\r\nlittle; and the boys carried the lanterns, not to be able to follow\r\nthe 'coon when started, but to discover him when \"treed,\" and to\r\nassist them in picking their way through the woods.\r\n\r\nDuring a raccoon-hunt, but little is seen either of the dogs or the\r\ngame. The woods, let the moon shine ever so bright, are pitch-dark;\r\nand the dogs rely on their scent and the hunter trusts to his ears.\r\n\r\nThe 'coon seldom strays far from his tree, and, of course, when\r\nstarted, draws a \"bee-line\" for home, and the game is for the\r\ndogs--which should be very swift, hardy animals, having the courage to\r\ntackle him if he should turn at bay--to overtake him, and compel him\r\nto take to some small tree, where he can be easily shaken off or shot.\r\nBut if he succeeds in reaching home, which he always makes in a large\r\ntree, he is safe, unless the hunter is willing to go to work and fell\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nThe boys were accompanied by their dogs, which followed close at their\r\nheels. Lightfoot was about to take his first lesson in hunting, but\r\nBrave and Sport evidently knew perfectly well what the game was to be,\r\nand it was difficult to restrain them.\r\n\r\nA few moments' walk brought them to the corn field. A rail-fence ran\r\nbetween the field and the woods; and two of the boys, after lighting\r\ntheir lanterns, climbed over the fence, and the others waved their\r\nhands to the dogs, and ordered them to \"hunt 'em up.\" Brave and Sport\r\nwere off in an instant, and Lightfoot was close at their heels,\r\nmechanically following their motions, and evidently wondering at their\r\nstrange movements.\r\n\r\nThe boys moved quietly along the fence, and, in a few moments, a\r\nquick, sharp yelp from Brave announced that he had started the first\r\n'coon. The boys cheered on the dogs, and presently a dark object\r\nappeared, coming at full speed through the corn, and passed, at a\r\nsingle bound, over the fence. The dogs, barking fierce and loud at\r\nevery jump, were close at his heels, and both they and the game\r\nspeedily disappeared in the darkness. The boys followed after, picking\r\ntheir way through the bushes with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe chase was a short one, for the dogs soon broke out in a regular,\r\ncontinuous barking, which announced that the 'coon was treed. The\r\nhunters, guided by the noise, soon came in sight of them, standing at\r\nthe foot of a small sapling. Brave and Sport took matters very easily,\r\nand seemed satisfied to await the arrival of the boys, but Lightfoot\r\nhad caught sight of the 'coon as he was ascending the tree, and was\r\nbounding into the air, and making every exertion to reach him.\r\n\r\nFrank and Harry stood ready with their guns to shoot him, and the\r\nothers held their lanterns aloft, and peered up into the top of the\r\ntree, to discover his hiding-place; but nothing could be seen of him.\r\nThe sapling had grown up rather high, and all objects outside of the\r\ncircle of light made by their lanterns seemed to be concealed by\r\nEgyptian darkness.\r\n\r\n\"He's up there, I know,\" said Archie.\r\n\r\nAnd, laying down his ax and lantern, he caught hold of the sapling,\r\nand shook it with all his strength. But it was a little too large for\r\nhim to manage, and, although it swayed considerably, the 'coon could\r\neasily retain his hold.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Archie, \"if he will not come down to us, we'll have to go\r\nup to him, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he commenced ascending the tree. Archie was a good hand at\r\nclimbing, and had shaken more than one 'coon from his roost, and he\r\ncarefully felt his way up, until he had almost reached the top of the\r\nsapling, when, not wishing to trust his weight on the small limbs, he\r\nstopped, and again shook the tree, and this time with better success.\r\nThere was an angry snarling among the branches above his head, and the\r\n'coon, after trying in vain to retain his hold, came tumbling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought the dogs were upon him, and, although he made a most\r\ndesperate resistance, he was speedily overpowered and killed.\r\n\r\nThe boys picked up their prize, and went back to the cornfield. The\r\ndogs were again sent in, and another 'coon was started, which, like\r\nthe first, \"drew a bee-line\" for the woods, with the dogs close\r\nbehind, and the boys, worked up to the highest pitch of excitement,\r\nfollowed after as fast as their legs could carry them.\r\n\r\nThe 'coon had managed to get a good start of his pursuers, and he led\r\nthem a long chase through a low, swampy part of the woods, to the top\r\nof a ridge, where the heavy timber grew; and when, at length, the boys\r\ncame up with the dogs, they found them standing at the foot of a large\r\nmaple fully ten feet in circumference.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed George, \"the rascal has succeeded in reaching home.\r\nGood-by, 'coon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, leaning on the muzzle of his gun, and wiping the\r\nperspiration from his forehead, \"we're minus that 'coon, easily\r\nenough, unless we wait until morning, and cut the tree down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, boys,\" suddenly exclaimed George, who had been holding his\r\nlantern above his head, and examining the sides of the tree; \"did you\r\never see a tree look like this before?\"\r\n\r\nAs they moved around to the side where George stood, Archie called\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\"There must be a big nest of 'coons in here; the tree is completely\r\nskinned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, \"we've accidentally stumbled upon a regular\r\n'coon-tree. There must be a big family of them living here. The tree\r\nlooks as if some one had taken an ax and cleaned off the bark. But,\"\r\nhe added, \"finding where the 'coons have been and catching them are\r\ntwo very different things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Archie, \"You don't pretend to say that\r\nthe 'coons are not in the tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do. I wouldn't be afraid to stake Brave against any\r\nlittle cur in the village that the 'coon the dogs have just followed\r\nhere is the only one in the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, now is their feeding-time, and all the 'coons in this part of\r\nthe woods are in the cornfield. It wouldn't pay to cut down this big\r\ntree for one 'coon; so let's go home and go to bed, and early\r\nto-morrow morning we will come back here and bag our game.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys agreed to this, and they whistled to their dogs, and started\r\nthrough the woods toward home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the first peep of day, they again set out, and in\r\nhalf an hour arrived at the 'coon-tree.\r\n\r\nThe boys knew that they had something to accomplish before they could\r\nsecure their game, but they were not the ones to shun hard work. They\r\nhad frequently cut down trees for a single 'coon, and they felt\r\nconfident that there were at least three of the animals in the tree,\r\nand they were willing to work for them.\r\n\r\nArchie and George were armed, as on the preceding night, with axes,\r\nand, after pulling off their coats, they placed themselves on opposite\r\nsides of the tree, and set manfully to work. Harry and Frank stood by,\r\nready to take their places when they grew tired, and the dogs seated\r\nthemselves on the ground close by, with their tongues hanging out of\r\nthe sides of their mouths, and now and then giving vent to an\r\nimpatient whine.\r\n\r\nThe boys worked for an hour and a half--taking their turns at\r\nchopping--almost without speaking. At length the top of the tree began\r\nto waver, and a loud crack announced that it was about to fall. Frank\r\nand Archie were chopping, and the blows of their axes resounded with\r\nredoubled force, and the other boys caught up the guns, and ran off in\r\nthe direction in which the tree was about to fall, followed by Sport\r\nand Lightfoot, and Brave stationed himself close behind his master,\r\nand barked and whined furiously.\r\n\r\nA few sturdy blows finished the business, and the tree began to\r\nsink--slowly at first, then with a rushing sound, and struck the earth\r\nwith a tremendous crash. In an instant boys and dogs were among the\r\nbranches. The 'coons--some of which were not injured in the least by\r\nthe fall--scattered in every direction; and one of them--a fine, large\r\nfellow--bounded off through the bushes.\r\n\r\nFrank discovered him just in time, and, fearing that he would lose\r\nsight of him, he hurled his ax at him with all his strength; but it\r\nwent wide of the mark, and Frank started in hot pursuit. He was very\r\nswift of foot, and there seemed to be no limit to his endurance, but,\r\nin running through the bushes, the 'coon had decidedly the advantage.\r\nFrank was not slow to discover this, and he began to think about\r\nsending his ax after him again, when he heard a crashing in the bushes\r\nbehind him, and the grayhound passed him like the wind, and two or\r\nthree of his tremendous bounds brought him up with the 'coon.\r\n\r\nFrank knew very well that Lightfoot had something of a job before him,\r\nfor it requires a very tough, active dog to \"handle\" a full-grown coon\r\nwhen he is cornered. But Frank thought it was a capital time to judge\r\nof the grayhound's \"grit;\" so he cheered him on, and hurried forward\r\nto witness the fight.\r\n\r\nAs Lightfoot came up, he made a grab at the 'coon, which, quick as a\r\nflash, eluded him, and, when the hound turned upon him, the 'coon gave\r\nhim one severe bite, when Lightfoot uttered a dismal howl, and,\r\nholding his nose close to the ground, beat a hasty retreat; and the\r\nYoung Naturalist could not induce him to return.\r\n\r\nDuring the fight, short as it was, Frank had gained considerably, and,\r\nas the 'coon turned to make off, he again threw his ax at him, which,\r\ntrue to its aim, struck the 'coon on the head, and stretched him\r\nlifeless on the ground.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Archie was endeavoring to secure his 'coon, under rather\r\nmore difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tree had begun to fall, Archie dropped his ax, seized a\r\nshort club that lay near him on the ground, and, discovering a 'coon\r\nmaking for the bushes, he started after him at full speed.\r\n\r\nThe animal appeared to run heavily, as if he had been partially\r\nstunned by the falling of the tree; and Archie had followed him but a\r\nshort distance, when he had the satisfaction of discovering that he\r\nwas gaining at every step. The 'coon seemed to understand that his\r\nchance of escape was rather small; and, after various windings and\r\ntwistings, commenced ascending a small tree. Archie ran forward with\r\nall possible speed, with the hope of reaching the tree before he could\r\nclimb out of the way. The 'coon moved but slowly, and Archie felt sure\r\nof his prize; and, as soon as he came within the proper distance, he\r\nstruck a powerful blow at the animal, but he was just out of reach,\r\nand the club was shivered to pieces against the tree.\r\n\r\nArchie, however, did not hesitate a moment, but, placing his hands on\r\nthe tree, commenced climbing after him. The 'coon ascended to the\r\ntopmost branch, and looked down on his enemy, growling and snapping\r\nhis teeth, as if to warn him that he intended to make a desperate\r\nresistance; but Archie was not in the least intimidated, and, reaching\r\nthe branch on which the 'coon was seated, he shook it violently, and\r\nthe animal tumbled to the ground, and, as soon as he could regain his\r\nfeet, started off again.\r\n\r\nArchie descended as quickly as possible, and started in pursuit,\r\nhoping to overtake his game before he could again take to a tree.\r\nThere was an abundance of large trees growing in the woods, and, if\r\nthe 'coon should take it into his head to ascend one of them, Archie\r\nmight whistle for his game.\r\n\r\nThe young hunter well understood this, and he \"put in his best licks,\"\r\nas he afterward remarked, and, in a few moments, had almost overtaken\r\nhim, and began to look around for something to strike him with, when\r\nthe 'coon, as if guessing his intention, suddenly turned and ran up a\r\nlarge tree that stood close by, and, crawling out on a limb, about\r\nfifty feet from the ground, he settled himself down, as if he had\r\nconcluded to take matters more easily.\r\n\r\nThis was discouraging; and Archie seated himself on a log under the\r\ntree, and for a moment thought seriously of giving up the chase. But\r\nthe 'coon was a fine, fat fellow, and his skin would make a valuable\r\naddition to the museum, and, besides, he had followed him so far\r\nalready, that he was reluctant to go back to his companions without\r\nhim, and, on second thought, he concluded that he would _not_ go back\r\nunless he could carry the 'coon with him.\r\n\r\nHe first thought of ascending the tree, but, after taking a hasty\r\nsurvey of it, he abandoned the idea. The tree was partially decayed;\r\nin fact, there was but one sound limb in it that Archie could\r\ndiscover, and that was about four feet above the one on which the\r\n'coon was seated, and stretched out directly over it.\r\n\r\nArchie did not like the idea of trusting himself among the unsound\r\nlimbs, and, besides, the cunning animal had crawled out to the extreme\r\nend of one of the decayed branches, which bent beneath his weight,\r\nand the young hunter, of course, could not follow him.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way that Archie could discover to bring him down;\r\nand he straightway opened upon the devoted 'coon a tremendous shower\r\nof clubs and sticks. He was a very accurate thrower, and, for some\r\ntime, had hopes of being able to bring down the 'coon; but, although\r\nthe missiles frequently hit him, Archie could not throw them with\r\nsufficient force; and he again turned his attention to the tree.\r\nThrowing his arms around it, he commenced working his way up. The bark\r\nwas very smooth and slippery, and the lowest limb was the one on which\r\nthe 'coon had taken refuge; but he kept steadily at work, and his\r\nprogress, though slow, was sure, and he reached the limb; and, bearing\r\nas little of his weight as possible upon it, he drew himself up to the\r\nsound limb above.\r\n\r\nAfter testing it thoroughly, to make sure that it would sustain his\r\nweight, he commenced walking out on the branch on which the 'coon was\r\nseated, keeping a firm hold of the limb above his head. He had made\r\nscarcely a dozen steps, when there was a loud crack, and the branch on\r\nwhich he was standing broke into fragments, and fell to the ground\r\nwith a crash, carrying the 'coon with it, and leaving Archie hanging\r\nin the air, fifty feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nNot in the least terrified at his dangerous situation, the young\r\nhunter coolly swung himself up on the limb, and, crawling carefully\r\nback to the tree, slid rapidly down the trunk, and, as if nothing had\r\nhappened, ran to the place where the 'coon had fallen, hoping that at\r\nlast he was secured.\r\n\r\nBut he was again disappointed. Nothing was to be seen of the animal,\r\nand only a few drops of blood on the leaves indicated the direction in\r\nwhich he had gone. This quickly caught Archie's eye, and he began to\r\nfollow up the trail, which led toward a creek that flowed close by.\r\nBut when he arrived upon its bank he was again at fault--the trail was\r\nlost; and, while he was running up and down the bank, searching for\r\nit, he happened to cast his eye toward the opposite side of the creek,\r\nand there was his 'coon, slowly ascending a tall stump that stood at\r\nthe water's edge.\r\n\r\nArchie could not refrain from giving a shout of joy, for he was\r\nconfident that the chase would soon be over; and he hurried,\r\nimpatiently, up and down the bank to find some place to cross, and\r\nfinally discovered a small tree lying in the water, whose top reached\r\nalmost to the opposite bank. The 'coon had undoubtedly crossed on this\r\nbridge; and Archie sprang upon it. It shook considerably, but he kept\r\non, and had almost reached the opposite side, when the tree broke, and\r\nhe disappeared in the cold water. He rose immediately, and, shaking\r\nthe water from his face, struck out for the shore, puffing and blowing\r\nlike a porpoise. A few lusty strokes brought him to the bank, and, as\r\nhe picked up a handful of stones, he said to himself,\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'm all right now. If I could only have found some stones\r\nwhen I treed that 'coon in the woods, he would not have been up there\r\nnow, and I should not have got this wet hide. But we'll soon settle\r\naccounts now.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the 'coon had taken refuge in a high stump. The\r\nbranches had all fallen off, with the exception of one short one,\r\nabout two feet from the top; and the 'coon, after trying in vain to\r\nsqueeze 'himself into a small hole, about half-way up the stump,\r\nsettled down on this limb, and appeared to be awaiting his fate.\r\n\r\nArchie took a favorable position, and, selecting a stone, hurled it\r\nwith all his force at the 'coon. It whizzed harmlessly by, close to\r\nhis head; but the next brought him to the ground, dead.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed the young hunter, as he shouldered his prize, and\r\nwalked up the creek to find a crossing-place, \"I've worked pretty hard\r\nfor 'coons, first and last, but this beats all the hunts I ever\r\nengaged in.\"\r\n\r\nHe at length reached a place where the water was about knee-deep,\r\nwaded across the creek, and started through the woods to find his\r\ncompanions. When he arrived at the place where they had felled the\r\ntree, he saw Harry sitting on a log, with Frank's gun in his hand, but\r\nnothing was to be seen of the other boys.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the latter discovered Archie, he burst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you think it a good joke,\" said Archie, as he came up, \"but\r\nI don't. It isn't a funny thing to tramp through the woods, on a cold\r\nday like this, with your clothes wringing wet. But I've got the\r\n'coon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have had a tough time catching him,\" said Harry. \"But let us\r\ngo down to the camp.\"\r\n\r\nAs they walked along, Archie related his adventures; and, when he told\r\nabout being \"dumped in the creek,\" Harry laughed louder than ever.\r\n\r\nA few moments' walk brought them to what Harry had called the \"camp.\"\r\nIt was in a little grove of evergreens, on the banks of a clear,\r\ndancing trout-brook. A place about forty feet square had been cleared\r\nof the trees and bushes and in it stood a small, neatly-built,\r\nlog-cabin, which Frank and some of his companions had erected the\r\nwinter previous.\r\n\r\nNear the middle of the cabin a hole about four feet square, had been\r\ndug, and in this a fire was burning brightly; and a hole in the roof,\r\ndirectly over it, did duty both as chimney and window.\r\n\r\nOn the floor, near the fire--or, rather, there _was_ no floor, the\r\nground serving for that purpose--stood some tin dishes, which one of\r\nthe boys had just brought to light from a corner of the cabin, four\r\nplates, as many knives and forks, two large platters, a coffee-pot,\r\nfour quart-cups, and a pan containing some trout, which George had\r\ncaught in the brook, all cleaned and ready for the spit, and there was\r\nalso a large plate of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nFrank, who always acted as cook on these expeditions, and knew how to\r\nget up a dinner that would tempt an epicure, was kneeling before the\r\nfire, engaged in skinning some squirrels which Brave had treed for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGeorge was in front of the cabin, chopping wood; and close by the door\r\nlay five 'coons--the fruits of the morning's hunt; and near them lay\r\nthe dogs, fast asleep.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene presented when Harry and Archie burst in upon the\r\ncamp. The latter was greeted with a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said he, as he threw his 'coon down with the others,\r\n\"you may laugh, but I wish some of you were obliged to go through what\r\nI did. I was bound to have the 'coon, if I had to follow him clear to\r\nMoosehead Lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to talk,\" said Frank. \"Now, throw yourself down by the\r\nfire, and I'll soon be ready to give you something to eat. A cup or\r\ntwo of hot coffee will set you all right again.\"\r\n\r\nArchie's ducking and his long walk in his wet clothes had chilled him\r\ncompletely through, and he was very willing to comply with his\r\ncousin's suggestion, and he drew up as close as possible to the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank had finished skinning the squirrels, he stuck them up\r\nbefore the fire, on spits, to roast. The trout he served in the same\r\nmanner; and, raking out a few live coals from the fire, he placed the\r\ncoffee-pot upon them, when the work of getting breakfast began in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nIn the course of half an hour the impatience of the hungry hunters\r\n(whose appetites had been sharpened by the savory smell of the cooking\r\nviands) was relieved by Frank's welcome invitation--\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, you may help yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they _did_ help themselves most bountifully.\r\n\r\nArchie kept his place by the fire, and a plate filled with bread and\r\nbutter, and roasted squirrel and trout, and a cup of coffee, were\r\npassed over to him; and, supporting himself on one elbow, he did them\r\nample justice.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were well supplied with what remained of the breakfast; and,\r\nafter washing the dishes in the clear water of the brook, and placing\r\nthem carefully away for future use, the boys seated themselves around\r\nthe fire, and Harry exclaimed, as he settled himself back into a\r\ncomfortable position,\r\n\r\n\"Give us a story, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Frank, after thinking a few moments, \"I remember one\r\nthat, I think, will interest you. You will probably remember, Archie,\r\nthat, during the last visit we made at Uncle Joe's, we met his brother\r\nDick, who has passed forty years of his life among the Rocky\r\nMountains. You will remember, also, that he and I went mink-trapping,\r\nand camped out all night, and during the evening he related to me some\r\nof his adventures, and wound up with the following story of his\r\n'chum,' Bill Lawson. I will try to give it, as nearly as possible, in\r\nhis own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBill Lawson's Revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This Bill Larson,\" said Dick, knocking the ashes from his pipe, \"was\r\n_some_ in his day. I have told you about his trappin' qualities--that\r\nthere was only one man in the county that could lay over him any, an'\r\nthat was ole Bob Kelly. But Bill had some strange ways about him,\r\nsometimes, that I could not understand, an' the way he acted a'most\r\nmade me think he was crazy. Sometimes you couldn't find a more jolly\r\nfeller than he was; an' then, again, he would settle down into one of\r\nhis gloomy spells, an' I couldn't get a word out of him. He would sit\r\nby the camp-fire, an' first fall to musing; then he would cover his\r\nface with his hands, an' I could see the big, scalding tears trickle\r\nthrough his fingers, an' his big frame would quiver and shake like a\r\ntree in a gale of wind; then he would pull out his long, heavy\r\nhuntin'-knife, an' I could see that he had several notches cut in the\r\nhandle. He would count these over an' over again; an' I could see a\r\ndark scowl settle on his face, that would have made me tremble if I\r\nhad not known that I was his only sworn friend, an' he would mutter,\r\n\r\n\"'Only seven! only seven! There ought to be eight. There is one left.\r\nHe must not escape me. No, no; he must die!'\r\n\r\n\"An' then he would sheath his knife, an' roll himself up in his\r\nblanket, an' cry himself to sleep like a child.\r\n\r\n\"I had been with ole Bill a'most ten years--ever since I was a\r\nboy--but he had never told me the cause of his trouble. I didn't dare\r\nto ask him, for the ole man had curious ways sometimes, an' I knowed\r\nhe wouldn't think it kind of me to go pryin' into his affairs, an' I\r\nknowed, too, that some day he would tell me all about it.\r\n\r\n\"One night--we had been followin' up a bar all day--we camped on the\r\nside of a high mountain. It was very cold. The wind howled through the\r\nbranches of the trees above our heads, makin' us pull our blankets\r\ncloser about us an' draw as nigh to the fire as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Bill sat, as usual, leanin' his head on his hands, an' lookin'\r\nsteadily into the fire. Neither of us had spoken for more than an\r\nhour. At len'th the ole man raised his head, an' broke the silence by\r\nsayin',\r\n\r\n\"'Dick, you have allers been a good friend to me, an' have stuck by\r\nme like a brother, through thick an' thin, an', I s'pose, you think it\r\nis mighty unkind in me to keep any thing from you; an' so it is. An'\r\nnow I'll tell you all.'\r\n\r\n\"He paused a moment, an', wipin' the perspiration from his forehead\r\nwith his coat-sleeve, continued, a'most in a whisper,\r\n\r\n\"'Dick, I was not allers as you see me now--all alone in the world.\r\nOnce I was the happiest boy west of the mountains. My father was a\r\ntrader, livin' on the Colorado River, I had a kind mother, two as\r\nhandsome sisters as the sun ever shone on, an' my brother was one of\r\nthe best trappers, for a boy, I ever see. He was a good deal younger\r\nnor I was, but he was the sharer of all my boyish joys an' sorrows. We\r\nhad hunted together, an' slept under the same blanket ever since we\r\nwere big enough to walk. Oh! I was happy then! This earth seemed to me\r\na paradise. Now look at me--alone in the world, not one livin' bein'\r\nto claim me as a relation; an' all this was brought upon me in a\r\nsingle day.'\r\n\r\n\"Here the ole man stopped, an' buried his face in his hands; but,\r\nsuddenly arousin' himself, he continued,\r\n\r\n\"'One day, when the ice were a'most out of the river, father an' me\r\nconcluded it was about time to start on our usual tradin' expedition;\r\nso we went to work an' got all our goods--which consisted of beads,\r\nhatchets, lookin'-glasses, blankets, an' such like--into the big\r\ncanoe, an' were goin' to start 'arly in the mornin' to pay a visit to\r\nthe Osage Injuns, an' trade our things for their furs. That night,\r\nwhile we were eatin' our supper, a party of horsemen came gallopin'\r\nan' yellin' down the bank of the river, an', ridin' up to the door of\r\nthe cabin, dismounted, an', leavin' their horses to take care of\r\nthemselves, came in without ceremony. We knowed very well who they\r\nwere. They were a band of outlaws an' robbers, that had been in the\r\ncounty ever since I could remember, an', bein' too lazy to make an\r\nhonest livin' by trappin', they went around plunderin' an' stealin'\r\nfrom every one they come across. They had stole three or four horses\r\nfrom us, an' had often come to our cabin an' called for whisky; but\r\nthat was an article father never kept on hand. Although he was an ole\r\ntrapper, an' had lived in the woods all his life, he never used it,\r\nan' didn't believe in sellin' it to the red-skins. The captain of the\r\noutlaws was a feller they called \"Mountain Tom,\" an' he was meaner\r\nthan the meanest Injun I ever see. He didn't think no more of cuttin'\r\na man's throat than you would of shootin' a buck. The minute they came\r\ninto the cabin we could see that they had all been drinkin'. They\r\nacted like a lot of wild buffalo-bulls, an', young as I was, I could\r\nsee that they meant mischief, an' I knowed that our chance for life\r\nwas small indeed. As I arterwards learned, they had been up the river,\r\nabout two miles, to a half-breed's shanty, an' had found half a barrel\r\nof whisky, an', arter killin' the half-breed, an' drinkin' his liquor,\r\nthey felt jest right for a muss, an' had come down to our cabin on\r\npurpose for a fight.\r\n\r\n\"'\"Now, ole Lawson,\" said Mountain Tom, leanin' his rifle up in the\r\ncorner, \"we have come down here for whisky. We know you've got some;\r\nso jest draw your weasel, if you want to save unpleasant feelin's; an'\r\nbe in a hurry about it, too, for we're mighty thirsty.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"Tom,\" said my father, \"how often have I told you that I haven't got\r\na drop of liquor in the shanty? I never had. I don't use it myself,\r\nan' I don't keep it for--\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"That's a lie!\" yelled three or four of the band.\r\n\r\n\"'\"You a trader among the Injuns, an' not keep whisky?\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"We know a thing or two more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"We have heard that story often enough,\" said Tom. \"We know you have\r\ngot the liquor, an' we are goin' to get it afore we leave this shanty.\r\nIf you won't bring it out an' treat, like white man had ought to do,\r\nwe'll have to look for it ourselves--that's all. Here, boys,\" he said,\r\nturning to his men, \"jest jump down into the cellar an' hunt it up,\r\n'cause we know he's got some. An' you, Jake,\" he added, catching hold\r\nof a big, ugly-lookin' feller, \"you stand here, an shoot the first one\r\nthat tries to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The men ran down into the cellar, and we could hear them cussin' an'\r\nswearin', as they overturned every thing in the useless search. My\r\nmother, a'most frightened to death, gathered us children around her,\r\nan' sank back into the furthest corner. I thought my father had gone\r\ncrazy; he strode up an' down the floor of the cabin like some caged\r\nwild animal, clenchin' his hands an' grindin' his teeth in a way that\r\nshowed that there was plenty of fight in him, if he only had a chance\r\nto let it out. Once in awhile he would look at his rifle, that hung\r\nagainst the wall, then at the man that stood at the top of the\r\ncellar-stairs, guardin' us, as if he had a'most made up his mind to\r\nbegin a knock-down an' drag-out fight with the rascals. But then he\r\nwould look at my mother an' us children, back in the corner, an' go to\r\npacin' the floor again. If we had been out of the way, I know that he\r\nwould not have let them rummage about as he did; he would have had a\r\nfight with them that would do your eyes good to look at. But, as it\r\nwas, I guess he kinder thought that if he was peaceable they would go\r\noff an' leave us, arter they found that no whisky was to be had. After\r\nsearchin' around the cellar for more 'n ten minutes, one of 'em called\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\"'\"Wal, boys, it's easy enough to see that the cuss has fooled\r\nus. Thar's no liquor here. He's hid it in the woods, somewhere 'bout\r\nthe shantee.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"That's so,\" said another. \"I'll bet he has got plenty of whisky\r\nsomewhere. Let's go up and hang him till he tells us where it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"No, no, that won't do,\" said Mountain Tom. \"You fellers are gettin'\r\nso that you talk like babies. Shoot the rascal down. We've had trouble\r\nenough with him. If we can't get the liquor here, there are plenty of\r\nplaces where we can get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"That's the talk!\" yelled the band. \"Shoot him down! Tear him to\r\npieces!\"\r\n\r\n\"'The man who was standin' at the head of the stairs heard all the\r\nrascals had said, an', with a yell of delight, he raised his rifle an'\r\ndrew a bead on my mother. But the ole man was too quick for him. With\r\na bound like a painter, he sprang across the floor, an', grabbin' the\r\nvillain by the throat, lifted him from his feet, and throwed him down\r\ninto the cellar, an' in an instant shut the door, an' fastened it with\r\na heavy bar of wood. Then, takin' down his rifle, he said to us,\r\na'most in a whisper,\r\n\r\n\"'\"Now run! run for your lives! We must cross the prairy an' get into\r\nthe woods afore the rascals cut their way out. Run! quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"'My mother took my sisters by the hand an' led them out, an' me an'\r\nmy brother followed her. Father closed both the windows an' the door,\r\nan' fastened them on the outside. All this while the robbers had been\r\nyellin' an' swearin', an' cuttin' away at the cellar-door with their\r\ntomahawks; an' we well knowed that they would soon be out an' arter\r\nus. Our cabin stood in a large, natural prairy, an' we had to travel\r\nfull half a mile acrost the open ground afore we come to the woods. My\r\nfather followed close behind us, with his rifle, ready to shoot the\r\nfirst one that come in sight, an' kept urgin' us to go faster. We\r\nhadn't gone more'n half the distance acrost the prairy, when a loud\r\ncrash and yells of triumph told us, plain enough, that the villains\r\nhad worked their way out of the cellar. Then heavy blows sounded on\r\nthe window-shutter, which, strong as it was, we knowed could not long\r\nhold out ag'in 'em. In a few minutes it was forced from its hinges,\r\nan' Mountain Tom sprang out.\r\n\r\n\"'\"Here they are, boys,\" he shouted. \"Come on! We'll l'arn 'em not to\r\nhide--\"\r\n\r\n\"'The report of father's rifle cut short his words, an' Mountain Tom,\r\nthrowin' his hands high above his head, sank to the ground like a log.\r\nBy this time the rest of the band had come out, an the bullets rattled\r\naround us like hailstones. My father and brother both fell-the latter\r\nnever to rise; but father, although he had received three bullets,\r\nstaggered to his feet, an' follered along arter us, loadin' his rifle.\r\nThen began the race for life. It seemed to me that we flew over the\r\nground, but the villains gained on us at every step. Just as we\r\nreached the woods, my father called out,\r\n\r\n\"'\"Down--down, every one of you! They're going to shoot again!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Obeyin' that order was what saved my life. I throwed myself flat\r\ninto the bushes, an' escaped unhurt; but both my sisters were shot\r\ndead, an' my father received another ball that brought him to the\r\nground. My mother, instead of thinkin' of herself, kneeled beside him,\r\nan' supported his head in her arms. The next minute the outlaws\r\nentered the woods, an' one passed so close to me that I could have\r\ntouched him.\r\n\r\n\"'\"Wal, Bill Lawson,\" said a voice that I knowed belonged to Mountain\r\nTom, \"you see I'm here again. I s'pose you kind o' thought you had\r\nrubbed me out, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"Yes, I did,\" said father--an' his voice was so weak that I could\r\nhardly hear him.\r\n\r\n\"'\"You won't have a chance to draw a bead on me again, I guess. We shoot\r\nconsider'ble sharp--don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"I shan't live long,\" said father. \"But, whatever you do to me, be\r\nmerciful to my wife an'--\"\r\n\r\n\"'The dull thud of the tomahawk cut short my father's dying prayer, an'\r\nhis brains were spattered on the bush where I was concealed; an',\r\na'most at the same moment, another of the band buried his knife in my\r\nmother's heart.'\r\n\r\n\"Old Bill could go no further. He buried his face in his hands an'\r\ncried like a child. At length, by a strong effort, he choked down his\r\nsobs, and went on.\r\n\r\n\"'I knew no more until I found myself lyin' in the cabin of an ole\r\nhunter, who lived about ten miles from where we used to live. He had\r\nbeen out huntin', an' had found me lyin' close beside my father an'\r\nmother. He thought I was dead, too, at first, but he found no wounds\r\non me; so, arter buryin' all my relatives in one grave, he took me\r\nhome with him. In three or four days I was able to get around again;\r\nan', beggin' a rifle an' some powder an' ball of the ole hunter, I\r\nstarted out. I went straight to the grave that contained all I loved\r\non earth, an' there, kneelin' above their heads, I swore that my life\r\nshould be devoted to but one object--vengeance on the villains who had\r\nrobbed me of all my happiness. How well I have kept my oath the\r\nnotches on my knife will show. Seven of them have fallen by my\r\ntomahawk; one only is left, an' that is Mountain Tom. For fifteen long\r\nyears I have been on his trail; but the time will come when my\r\nvengeance will be complete.'\r\n\r\n\"An' the ole man rolled himself up in his blanket, an', turning his\r\nback to me, sobbed himself to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"But my story is not yet told,\" continued Dick. \"About a year arter\r\nthis, Bill an' me were ridin' along, about noon, in a little valley\r\namong the mountains, when we came, all of a sudden, on the camp of two\r\ntrappers.\r\n\r\n\"'Heaven be praised! there he is!' said ole Bill.\r\n\r\n\"An', swinging himself from his horse, he strode up to one of the men,\r\nwho sprang from his blanket, and ejaculated,\r\n\r\n\"'Bill Lawson!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yea, Mountain Tom,' said ole Bill, 'I'm here. You an' me have got a\r\nlong reckonin' to settle now.'\r\n\r\n\"The villain at first turned as pale as a skewer; but he seemed to\r\nregain his courage, and exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"'It won't take us long to settle up,'\r\n\r\n\"And, quick as lightnin', he drew his knife, an' made a pass at Bill.\r\n\r\n\"But he had got the wrong buck by the horn. The ole man was as quick\r\nas he; an', grabbin' hold of his arm, he took the knife away from him\r\nas if he had been a baby.\r\n\r\n\"'Tom,' said he, as he drew his tomahawk from his belt, 'I've followed\r\nyou all over this country for fifteen years, an', thank Heaven, I've\r\nfound you at last.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Bill,' shrieked the condemned man, sinkin' on his knees before\r\nthe ole man, 'I was--'\r\n\r\n\"'Stand up,' said Bill, ketchin' hold of him, an' jerkin' him to his\r\nfeet. 'You were brave enough when you were killing my wounded father.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Bill--'\r\n\r\n\"'With the tomahawk you killed my father, an' by the tomahawk you\r\nshall die.'\r\n\r\n\"'For mercy's sake, Bill,' again shrieked the terrified man, taking\r\nhold of a tree for support, 'hear me!'\r\n\r\n\"The tomahawk descended like a streak of light, and the last of the\r\nmurderers sank at the ole man's feet. The eighth notch was added to\r\nthose on the knife, an' the debt was canceled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nWild Geese.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the afternoon the boys concluded that it was\r\nabout time to start for home; so, after putting out the fire and\r\nfastening the door of the cabin, they set out. Archie led the way,\r\nwith a 'coon slung over each shoulder, and another dangling from his\r\nbelt behind. The others followed close after him, in \"Indian file.\" In\r\nthis manner they marched through the woods, joking and shouting, and\r\ntalking over the events of the day, and now and then indulging in a\r\nhearty laugh when they happened to think how Archie looked when he\r\ncame into the camp, dripping wet. But Archie took matters very\r\ngood-naturedly, and replied,\r\n\r\n\"If I had come back without the 'coon, I should never have heard the\r\nlast of it; and now you laugh at me because I fell into the drink\r\nwhile I was trying to catch him.\"\r\n\r\nIn half an hour they reached the edge of the timber, and were about to\r\nclimb over the fence into the cornfield, when a long, loud bark echoed\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\n\"That's Brave,\" exclaimed Frank; \"and,\" he continued, as all the dogs\r\nbroke out into a continuous cry, \"they've found something. Let's go\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys all agreed to this, and they started back through the woods\r\nas fast as their legs could carry them.\r\n\r\nA few moments' run brought them in sight of the dogs, sitting on their\r\nhaunches at the foot of a stump, that rose to the hight of twenty\r\nfeet, without leaf or branch. Near the top were several holes; and, as\r\nsoon as Frank discovered these, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"The dogs have got a squirrel in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we going to work to get him out?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Let's cut the stump down,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"That's too much sugar for a cent,\" answered Harry. \"That will be\r\nworking too hard for one squirrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why will it?\" asked George. \"The stump is rotten.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he laid down his 'coon, and walked up and dealt the stump several\r\nlusty blows with his ax.\r\n\r\nSuddenly two large black squirrels popped out of one of the holes\r\nnear the top, and ran rapidly around the stump. Quick as thought,\r\nFrank, who was always ready, raised his gun to his shoulder, and one\r\nof the squirrels came tumbling to the ground; but, before he had time\r\nto fire the second barrel, the other ran back into the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Hit the tree again, George,\" exclaimed Harry, throwing down his\r\n'coon, and bringing his gun to his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" said Frank; \"they will not come out again, if you pound\r\non the stump all day.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, however, did as his brother had requested, but not a squirrel\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Let's cut the tree down,\" said Archie.\r\n\r\nAnd, suiting the action to the word, he set manfully to work.\r\n\r\nA few blows brought off the outside \"crust,\" and the heart of the tree\r\nwas found to be decayed, and, in a few moments, it came crashing to\r\nthe ground, and was shivered into fragments by the fall.\r\n\r\nThe boys supposed that there was only one squirrel in the tree, and\r\nwere running up to secure him, when, to their surprise, they\r\ndiscovered a number of the little animals scattering in different\r\ndirections, and drawing \"bee-lines\" for the nearest trees.\r\n\r\nFrank killed one with his remaining barrel, and Harry, by an excellent\r\nshot, brought down another that had climbed up into the top of a tall\r\noak, and was endeavoring to hide among the leaves. Brave and Sport\r\nboth started after the same one, and overtook and killed it before it\r\ncould reach a tree; but the grayhound came very near losing his. As\r\nsoon as the stump had fallen, he singled out one of the squirrels,\r\nand, with two or three of his long bounds, overtook it; but, just as\r\nhe was going to seize it, the squirrel dived into a pile of brush, out\r\nof the reach of the hound. A few loud, angry yelps brought Archie and\r\nGeorge to his assistance, and they immediately began to pull the pile\r\nof brush to pieces. Suddenly the squirrel darted out, and started for\r\na tree that stood about two rods distant. The boys threw their clubs\r\nat him, but he reached the foot of the tree unharmed. At this moment\r\nLightfoot discovered him; two or three bounds carried him to the tree,\r\nand, crouching a moment, he sprang into the air, and attempted to\r\nseize the squirrel. But he was just a moment too late; the little\r\nanimal had ascended out of his reach; but the next moment the sharp\r\nreport of Harry's gun brought him to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe squirrels were now all secured, and the young hunters again turned\r\ntheir faces homeward.\r\n\r\nOne cold, stormy night, in the latter part of October, Frank and his\r\ncousin lay snug in bed, listening to the howling of the wind and the\r\npattering of the rain against the window, and talking over their\r\nplans for the future, when, all at once, Frank sat upright in bed,\r\nand, seizing Archie's arm with a grip that almost wrung from him a cry\r\nof pain, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Listen! listen!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment, clear and loud above the noise of the storm, they\r\nheard the trumpet-like notes of a flock of wild geese. They passed\r\nover the house, and the sound grew fainter as they flew rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\"My eye!\" exclaimed Archie, \"don't I wish it was daylight, and we\r\nstood out in front of the house, with our guns all ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a nice thing to wish for,\" answered Frank; \"but, if it were\r\ndaylight, we should not stand any better chance of shooting them than\r\nwe do here in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the first place, if they went over at all, they would fly so\r\nhigh that it would need a rifle to reach them; and, in the next place,\r\nwe have not got a rifle. Just wait until morning, and we'll make a\r\nscattering among them, if some one don't get the start of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we are not the only ones that have heard them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by a good deal. I shouldn't wonder if there were a dozen fellows\r\nthat have made up their minds to have a crack at them in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Frank was right. Many a young hunter, as he lay in bed and heard\r\nthe wild geese passing over, had determined to have the first shot at\r\nthem, and many a gun was taken down, and cleaned and loaded, in\r\nreadiness for the morning's hunt.\r\n\r\nWild geese seldom remained longer than two or three days about the\r\nvillage, and then they generally staid in the swamp. This made it\r\ndifficult for the young hunters to get a shot at them, and only the\r\nmost active and persevering ever succeeded.\r\n\r\nAlthough for a month the young sportsmen had been expecting them, and\r\nhad carefully scanned the river every morning, and listened for the\r\nwelcome \"honk-honk\" that should announce the arrival of the wished-for\r\ngame, this was the first flock that had made its appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" said Archie, \"that some one will get the start of us.\r\nLet's get up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; lie still and go to sleep,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid we shall oversleep ourselves. I wonder what time it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll soon find out,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd, bounding out on to the floor, he lighted a match, and held it up\r\nbefore the little clock that stood on the mantle-piece.\r\n\r\n\"It's twelve o'clock,\" he continued.\r\n\r\nAnd he crawled back into bed, and in a few moments was almost asleep,\r\nwhen Archie suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"They're coming back!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the geese again passed over the house, in full cry.\r\n\r\nThey knew it was the same flock, because they came from toward the\r\nriver, and that was the same direction in which they had gone but a\r\nfew moments before.\r\n\r\nIn a short time they again returned; and, during the quarter of an\r\nhour that followed, they passed over three times more.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what is the matter with those geese,\" said Archie, at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied Frank; \"only they have got a little bewildered, and\r\ndon't know which way to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will we have to go to find them in the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up to the swamp,\" answered Frank. \"The last time they passed over\r\nthey flew toward the north, and the swamp is the only place in that\r\ndirection where they can go to find water, except Duck Lake, and that\r\nis too far for them to fly this stormy night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was morning,\" said Archie, again. \"Let's get up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use? It will be five long hours before it will be light\r\nenough to hunt them up; and we might as well go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we shall sleep too long,\" said Archie, again, \"and that\r\nsome one will beat us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" answered Frank; \"I'll wake you up at three\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he turned over and arranged his pillow, and in a few moments was\r\nfast asleep. But Archie was so excited that he found it difficult even\r\nto lie still; and he lay awake almost two hours, thinking of the sport\r\nthey should have in the morning, and at last dropped into an unquiet\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had hardly closed his eyes, when a strong\r\nhand was laid on his shoulder, and a voice said, in his ear,\r\n\r\n\"Wake up here; it's three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not need a second call, but was out on the floor in an instant.\r\n\r\nIt was still storming. The wind moaned and whistled through the\r\nbranches of the trees around the cottage, and sent the big drops of\r\nrain rattling against the window. It was a wild time to go hunting,\r\nand some boys would have preferred tumbling back into bed again. But\r\nFrank and his cousin had made up their minds that if any one got a\r\nshot at the geese, they were to be the ones.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were dressed, Frank led the way into the kitchen, and,\r\nwhile he was lighting a fire, Archie brought out of the pantry a pan\r\nof milk, two spoons and bowls, and a loaf of bread. He was so\r\nimpatient to \"get a crack at the geese,\" as he said, that, although he\r\nwas very fond of bread and milk, he could scarcely eat at all.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid some one will get the start of us,\" he exclaimed, noticing\r\nthat his cousin, instead of being in a hurry, was taking matters very\r\ncoolly.\r\n\r\n\"What if they do?\" answered Frank, deliberately refilling his bowl\r\nfrom the pan. \"We shall stand just as good a chance as they do. It\r\nwill not be daylight these two hours. It's as dark as pitch, and all\r\nwe can do is to go up to the swamp, and get under a tree, and wait\r\nuntil it is light enough to see where our geese are.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished their breakfast, they brought out their\r\nguns, and began to prepare for the hunt. Extra charges were put in\r\neach barrel; and, while they were drawing on their rubber coats,\r\nArchie said,\r\n\r\n\"We had better leave my dogs at home, hadn't we? Lightfoot would make\r\ntoo much noise, and Sport, although he would keep still enough, would\r\nbe of no use to us, for he will not go into the water after a wounded\r\nbird.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, \"we had better leave them behind. But we must have\r\nBrave with us. I'll go and call him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he opened the door, and, walking out upon the piazza, which ran\r\nentirely around the cottage, gave a low whistle. There was a slight\r\nrustling among the straw in the kennel where the dogs slept, and Brave\r\ncame out, and followed his master into the house.\r\n\r\nAfter wrapping up their guns in their coats, they were ready to set\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour's walk, through mud up to their ankles, brought them to\r\nUncle Mike's house, which stood at the end of the road, and, climbing\r\nover the fence that inclosed his pasture, they struck off through the\r\nwoods toward the lake.\r\n\r\nAfter picking their way for half a mile over fallen logs, and through\r\nwet, tangled bushes, Frank, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped,\r\nand, leaning back against a tree to get out of the rain, said,\r\n\r\n\"Here we are. Had we better try to cross the creek now, or shall we\r\nwait until daylight?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have cat's eyes,\" said Archie, trying to peer through the\r\ndarkness. \"I knew there was a creek here somewhere, but I didn't\r\nsuppose we had reached it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have; and, unless I am very much mistaken, you will find the\r\nbridge right before you. Shall we try to cross it now? It will be a\r\nslippery job.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"bridge\" that Frank referred to was simply a large tree that the\r\nboys had felled across the creek, and stripped of its branches. It\r\ncould easily be crossed in the day-time, but in a dark, stormy night\r\nit was a difficult task to undertake. The boys could scarcely see\r\ntheir hands before them; and Frank had accomplished something worth\r\nboasting of in being able to conduct his cousin directly to the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n\"It will require the skill of a rope-dancer to cross that bridge now,\"\r\nsaid Archie; \"and, if we should happen to slip off into the water, we\r\nwould be in a nice fix.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Frank, \"if we did succeed in crossing, we could not go\r\nfar in the dark, on account of the swamp; so, I think, we had better\r\nwait.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys stood under the tree, talking in low tones, when Frank\r\nsuddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"We're all right. The geese are in the lake. Do you hear that?\"\r\n\r\nArchie listened, and heard a splashing in the water, mingled with the\r\nhoarse notes of the gander.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was daylight,\" said he, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be in a hurry,\" said Frank; \"there's time enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they will start off as soon as it gets light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; the lake is a good feeding-ground, and they would stay,\r\nperhaps, all day, if they were not disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nIn about an hour the day began to dawn; and, as soon as objects on the\r\nopposite side of the creek could be discerned, Frank led the way\r\nacross the bridge. A short run through the woods brought them to the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nNow the hunt began in earnest. The swamp was covered with water,\r\nwhich, in some places, was two feet deep; and the trees and bushes\r\ngrew so thick, that it was with difficulty that they could work their\r\nway through them. Besides, they were obliged to proceed very\r\ncarefully, for every step brought them nearer the game; and the\r\nslightest splashing in the water, or even the snapping of a twig,\r\nmight alarm them.\r\n\r\nAt length they found themselves on the shore of the lake; and, peering\r\nout from behind a thicket, where they had crept for concealment, they\r\ndiscovered, about half-way to the opposite shore, as fine a flock of\r\ngeese as one would wish to see--fifteen of them in all. They were\r\nswimming around, turning their heads first one way and then the other,\r\nas if they had been alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long shot, isn't it?\" said Archie, measuring the distance with\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered his cousin; \"but that is not the worst of it; they are\r\ngetting further away from us every moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Archie, cocking his gun, and pushing it carefully through\r\nthe bushes, \"you be ready to take them as they rise.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took a quick aim at the nearest of the flock, and\r\npulled the trigger. The cap snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Plague on the gun!\" he exclaimed. \"Shall I throw it in the lake!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" answered Frank; \"try the other barrel; and you had better be\r\nquick about it--they're going to fly.\"\r\n\r\nArchie again raised his gun to his shoulder. This time there was no\r\nmistake. The nearest of the geese received the entire charge, and lay\r\ndead on the water.\r\n\r\nFrank now waited for his turn; but the geese, after skimming along the\r\nsurface of the water until they were out of gun-shot, rose in the air,\r\nand flew rapidly across the lake.\r\n\r\nAs the boys stood watching their flight, they saw a cloud of smoke\r\nissue from a clump of bushes on the opposite shore, followed by the\r\nreport of a gun, and one of the flock fell to the water, and another,\r\nevidently badly wounded, rose high in the air, and flew wildly about.\r\nAnother puff of smoke rose from the bushes, a second report was heard,\r\nand the wounded bird came tumbling into the lake.\r\n\r\nThe geese, surprised at this sudden repulse, quickly wheeled, and flew\r\nback toward the place where our hunters were stationed.\r\n\r\nFrank raised his gun to his shoulder, and, as soon as they came within\r\nrange, he pulled the trigger, and brought down two geese--one\r\nstone-dead, and the other with a broken wing. Hardly waiting to see\r\nthe effect of the shot, he fired his second barrel at the flock, just\r\nas they were disappearing over the tops of the trees. They had flown\r\nso high, that he hardly expected the shot would prove effective. To\r\nhis surprise, one of the flock gradually fell behind, and, after\r\ntrying in vain to support itself, fell slowly through the air, until\r\nit almost reached the water; then it seemed to regain the power of\r\nusing its wings, and began to fly more regularly.\r\n\r\n\"Try your gun again, Archie,\" said Frank; \"I'm afraid we are going to\r\nlose him.\"\r\n\r\nArchie accordingly drew a bead on the goose, but with no better\r\nsuccess, and the bird speedily disappeared over the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Confound my luck!\" exclaimed Archie, impatiently. \"I'll try and keep\r\nmy powder dry after this.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't fly far,\" said Frank. \"Let's be lively, and we will have\r\nhim yet. Here, Brave!\" he continued, pointing to the geese in the\r\nlake, \"fetch 'em out!\"\r\n\r\nBrave plunged into the water, and made toward the nearest of the\r\ngeese, which happened to be the one Frank had wounded. As soon as the\r\nbird saw him approaching, instead of trying to save himself by flight,\r\nhe raised himself in the water, elevated his uninjured wing, and set\r\nup a loud hiss. But these hostile demonstrations, instead of\r\nintimidating the Newfoundlander, served rather to enrage him, and he\r\nkept on, with open mouth, ready to seize the game. The moment he came\r\nwithin reach, the goose thrust out his long neck, and, catching Brave\r\nby the ear, dealt him a hard blow over the head with his wing. But he\r\ndid not have time to repeat it, for the dog gave a loud, angry yelp,\r\nand, springing forward in the water, seized the goose, and killed it\r\nwith a single bite; then, turning round, he swam back to the shore,\r\ndeposited the game at his master's feet, and again plunged in to bring\r\nout the others.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder who that is on the other side of the lake?\" said Archie.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it's Bill Johnson,\" answered Frank, who had reloaded his gun,\r\nand stood holding it in the hollow of his arm. \"I saw a dog that\r\nlooked very much like his bringing out the geese. There he is now!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the boy stepped out of the bushes, and a loud, shrill\r\nwhistle echoed across the lake.\r\n\r\n\"That's Bill,\" said Archie. \"Hallo!\" he continued, raising his voice\r\nso that William could hear; \"wait for us at Uncle Mike's--will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" shouted William, in reply.\r\n\r\nAnd, gathering up his game, he again disappeared in the bushes.\r\n\r\nBy this time Brave had brought out the last of the geese, and Archie\r\nhad succeeded in shooting off the wet charge; so they started back\r\ntoward the road.\r\n\r\nFrank led the way, carrying three of the geese; Brave followed close\r\nat his heels, carrying the fourth; and Archie brought up the rear,\r\nloading his gun as he went.\r\n\r\nAn hour's walk brought them to Uncle Mike's, where they found William\r\nsitting on the fence, waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\"What luck?\" inquired Archie, as they came up.\r\n\r\n\"Only two,\" answered William; \"but you have been more fortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Archie, \"we've got four; and Frank wounded another so\r\nbadly that he can't fly far. We are going to look for him in the\r\ncreek, as we go along.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I hope we shall get him,\" said Frank; \"for he was the largest of\r\nthe flock, and I want him for our museum.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys walked slowly down the creek, keeping a good look-out for the\r\nwounded bird among the reeds along the bank; but they reached the\r\ncottage without seeing any signs of him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we've lost him,\" said Archie.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Frank, \"for he was a nice, big fellow. Let's go\r\nback; perhaps we've overlooked him. I am certain that he could not\r\nhave flown to the river.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a slight splashing in the water, on the opposite side\r\nof the creek, attracted their attention, and they discovered their\r\ngame swimming slowly about among the reeds, as if trying to find some\r\nplace of concealment.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Archie,\" said Frank, dropping the butt of his gun to the ground,\r\n\"there's a chance for you to retrieve your lost reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll take advantage of it,\" said Archie, raising his gun to his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nA loud report followed his words, and the goose, after a few slight\r\nstruggles, lay motionless on the water. Brave immediately sprang into\r\nthe creek, and, forcing his way among the reeds, seized the bird and\r\nbrought it to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nChapter of Incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day had been set apart by Frank and his cousin for a\r\nsquirrel-hunt; but the first thing they heard, when they awoke in the\r\nmorning, was the pattering of the rain against their bedroom window,\r\nand the hunt was, to use Archie's expression, \"up stump.\" Although\r\nthey had been expecting exciting times, bringing down the squirrels\r\n(for the woods were fairly alive with them), and were a good deal\r\ndisappointed at being obliged to postpone their intended excursion,\r\nthey were not the ones to complain, they knew there would be many\r\npleasant days before the winter set in, and the hunt was put off\r\nwithout ceremony.\r\n\r\nThey were at no loss to know how to pass the day. There was plenty of\r\nwork to be done: their traps must be overhauled and put in working\r\norder; the Speedwell was waiting to be dismasted and put cover; their\r\nfishing-tackle must be oiled and packed away, their pets taken care\r\nof and provided with winter-quarters; and there was a host of other\r\nthings to attend to; and they were in no fear that the time would hang\r\nheavily on their hands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boys were dressed, they went into the shop and set\r\nmanfully to work. Archie kindled a fire in the stove--for it was a\r\ncold, unpleasant day--and Frank pulled from under the work-bench a\r\nlarge chest, filled with spring-traps, \"dead-falls,\" broken reels,\r\nscraps of lead, and numberless other things he had collected, and\r\nbegan to pull over the contents. The traps were taken out and\r\nsubjected to a thorough rubbing and greasing.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, their attention was attracted by the peculiar\r\n\"cawing\" of a crow that flew over the shop, and, a moment afterward, a\r\nwhole chorus of the harsh notes sounded in the direction of the woods.\r\nThe boys hurried to the door, and saw a multitude of crows pouring\r\nfrom every part of the woods, cawing with all their might, and\r\ndirecting their course toward a large pine-tree, which stood in the\r\nmeadow back of the orchard, and which was already covered with them.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"They act as if they had discovered an owl,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Have they? Let's go and shoot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will, probably, be a harder job than you anticipate,\" said\r\nFrank. \"However, we will try.\"\r\n\r\nAfter shutting the dogs up in the shop, the boys ran into the house,\r\ndrew on their rubber coats, and started through the orchard, loading\r\ntheir guns as they went--putting an extra charge of powder and a\r\ncouple of buck-shot into each barrel.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they reached the fence that ran between the orchard\r\nand the meadow, and Archie inquired,\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't go much further,\" said Frank, drawing a flap of his coat\r\nover his gun, to protect it from the rain. \"There isn't a stump, or\r\neven a tuft of grass, in the meadow large enough to cover us. Besides,\r\nif we undertake to climb over the fence, every crow will be out of\r\nsight in a moment; then good-by, owl.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't fly off, would he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say he would,\" answered Frank, with a laugh. \"He'd leave\r\nlike a streak of lightning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's news to me. I always thought owls couldn't see in the\r\nday-time. Natural history says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Frank. \"But there is one thing certain: they must be\r\nable to see a little, or else their sense of smell or hearing is very\r\nacute for it is very difficult to get a shot at them, even in the\r\nday-time. That one in our museum led me a chase of half a day before I\r\nshot him, and I had a rifle, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done now?\" inquired Archie. \"We don't want to stand\r\nhere in the rain much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must wait until he flies into the woods, or somewhere else, so\r\nthat we can get a shot at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make him fly. I've killed squirrels further off than that, many\r\na time. Suppose I shoot at him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot away; but you must remember that an owl and a squirrel are two\r\ndifferent things. The thick feathers of the owl will glance a charge\r\nof shot that would blow a squirrel to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nArchie made no reply, but crawled up behind a thick cluster of\r\ncurrant-bushes that grew close by the fence, and, thrusting his gun\r\nbetween the branches, was settling himself into a comfortable\r\nposition, when the owl suddenly leaped from his perch, and flew off\r\ntoward the woods, as Frank had said he would, \"like a streak of\r\nlightning,\" followed by the whole flock of his tormentors, which\r\nscreamed with all their might.\r\n\r\n\"Now's our time,\" said Frank. \"Come on!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, clearing the fence at a bound, he started across the meadow at\r\nthe top of his speed. Archie followed close at his heels, and a few\r\nminutes run brought them to the edge of the woods.\r\n\r\n\"Now the hunt begins in earnest,\" said Frank, \"We must separate; we\r\nshall make too much noise if we go together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's the owl?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"As near as I can guess, he must be in that tall hemlock,\" answered\r\nFrank, pointing through the woods toward the tree in question.\r\n\r\nArchie immediately moved cautiously off in the direction indicated,\r\nleaving his cousin to take care if himself.\r\n\r\nGuided by the noise made by the crows, he soon discovered the owl, not\r\nwhere Frank had supposed him to be, but on a tree that stood to the\r\nright, and several rods further off. Placing a large tree between\r\nhimself and the game, he threw himself on his hands and knees, and\r\ncrawled along as silently as possible, taking good care to keep out of\r\nsight of the crows.\r\n\r\nHe had arrived almost within range of the owl, when he found before\r\nhim a spot of considerable extent, which was entirely destitute of\r\nbushes or large trees, and covered only with saplings, which grew so\r\nthinly that he would certainly be discovered if he attempted to pass\r\nthrough them. This brought him to a stand-still. He stood thinking\r\nwhether he had better risk a shot at the owl or retrace his steps,\r\nwhen one of the crews uttered a cry of warning, which was immediately\r\nanswered by the others, and the whole flock was out of sight in an\r\ninstant. The owl gazed around a moment with his great eyes, then\r\nspread his wings, leaped into the air, and was flying rapidly away,\r\nwhen there was a sharp report, and he came tumbling to the ground, and\r\nthe indefatigable Frank rose from the bushes, and ran forward to\r\nsecure his prize.\r\n\r\n\"Dished again!\" said Archie, to himself. \"I would have wagered a good\r\ndeal that Frank was not within gun-shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Archie, where are you?\" called out Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am. I thought, sure, that owl was mine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Archie came forward, holding his gun in the hollow of his arm, and\r\nlooking a little crest-fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You were not far behind,\" said Frank, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"That's poor consolation. I wanted to be first. Never mind,\" he added,\r\ncatching up the owl, and throwing it over his shoulder, \"I'll be ahead\r\nof you yet.\"\r\n\r\nThis generous rivalry had existed between the cousins from their\r\nearliest boyhood. In all athletic sports--such as running,\r\nball-playing, swimming, and the like--Archie was acknowledged to be\r\nthe superior; but in hunting Frank generally carried off the palm.\r\nArchie, however, perseveringly kept up the contest, and endeavored to\r\naccomplish, by bold and rapid movements, what his cousin gained by\r\nstrategy; and, although he sometimes bore off the prize, he more\r\nfrequently succeeded in \"knocking every thing in the head\" by what the\r\nboys called his \"carelessness.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the source of a great deal of merriment between the cousins;\r\nand, although they sometimes felt a little mortified at their defeat\r\n(as did Archie now), they ever afterward spoke of it as a \"good joke.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the boys went into the shop again, and Frank sharpened\r\nhis knife, and began to remove the skin of the owl, intending to stuff\r\nit and place it in the museum, while Archie took his ax and started\r\nfor a grove of willows, that grew on the banks of the creek, to get\r\nsome timber to make a dead-fall trap. He had been gone scarcely a\r\nmoment before he returned in a great hurry, and, throwing down his ax,\r\nseized his gun, which stood in the corner behind the door, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"Now I've got a chance to make up for losing that owl. A flock of\r\nducks, regular canvas-backs, have just flown over, and I think they\r\nlit in the swamp. You'll have to make tracks to get the start of me\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he shouldered his gun, and ran out of the shop, banging the door\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nFrank immediately dropped the owl, caught up his gun, and started in\r\nhot pursuit. But his cousin had made the most of his time, and, when\r\nFrank reached the gate, he saw Archie far up the road, tearing along\r\nas fast as his legs could carry him, and spattering the mud in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, Frank would have stopped to laugh; but,\r\nas it was, he had no time to lose. So he ran down the bank of the\r\ncreek, and, untying his skiff, pushed out into the stream, and a few\r\nstrokes of the oars brought him to the opposite shore; then, fastening\r\nthe skiff to a tree, he started through the woods, toward the swamp.\r\nThis enabled him to gain on his cousin almost half a mile.\r\n\r\nBut Archie happened to have luck on his side this time; for the ducks,\r\ninstead of alighting in the swamp, as he had supposed, had come down\r\nin the creek; and, as he was hurrying along the road, which ran close\r\nto the creek, a slight splashing in the water and a hoarse \"quack\"\r\nattracted his attention, and caused him to proceed with more caution.\r\nHe listened until the noise was repeated, in order that he might know\r\nexactly where the ducks were, and then began to worm his way through\r\nthe wet bushes, in the direction of the sound. At length he crawled up\r\nbehind a large log, that lay close to the water's edge, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of finding the game fairly before him.\r\n\r\nBut the most difficult part of the undertaking was yet to come. The\r\nducks--seven of them in all--were fully twenty rods off; and, although\r\nArchie had great confidence in the \"shooting qualities\" of his gun, he\r\nhardly dared to fire--he might only wound the birds; and, as he had no\r\nammunition with him besides the loads in his gun, he was anxious to\r\nmake every shot tell.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do,\" he soliloquized. \"I must get up nearer.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to retrace his steps, when he noticed that the ducks\r\nbegan to move impatiently around, and acted as if about to fly.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Archie's mind was made up; it was now or never; and,\r\ntaking a quick aim at the nearest of the flock, he blazed away. It was\r\nhis only chance, and a slim one at that, for the distance was so great\r\nthat he hardly expected the shot would take effect; but, when the\r\nsmoke cleared away, he discovered one of the flock lying motionless on\r\nthe water, and another, too badly wounded to rise, was swimming slowly\r\naround him. The rest of the flock were skimming along the surface of\r\nthe creek, toward the swamp. They were far beyond the range of his\r\ngun, and he knew it would do no good to fire at them; so he concluded,\r\nto use his own expression, to \"make sure of what he had got,\" and,\r\ntaking aim at the wounded bird, was about to give it the contents of\r\nthe other barrel, when he heard the report of a gun some distance\r\nfurther up the creek, and looked up just in time to see one of the\r\nbirds fall into the water.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that, I wonder,\" said Archie, to himself. \"It can't be Frank,\r\nfor he wouldn't be on that side of the creek; besides, I had a good\r\nlong start of him.\"\r\n\r\nHis soliloquy was cut short by the movements of the flock, which,\r\ninstead of continuing on their course up the creek, rose higher in the\r\nair, and flew about in confusion.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity was not lost by the concealed sportsman, and a second\r\nbird came down with a broken wing. The ducks then wheeled and flew\r\nback toward the place where Archie was stationed. As soon as they came\r\nwithin range, he fired and brought down another bird, which landed\r\namong the bushes on the opposite side of the creek.\r\n\r\nHe now turned his attention to the wounded duck, which was swimming in\r\na circle around his dead companion, as if perfectly bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had my powder-flask and shot-bag,\" said Archie. \"How foolish\r\nI was not to bring them! I bet that I'll never start out again with\r\nonly one load in my gun.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no time for regrets. The duck seemed to be recovering\r\nhis strength, and began co flap his wings, as if preparing to fly.\r\nArchie began to fear that he should lose him; and, throw down his\r\ngun, he gathered up an armful of sticks and branches, and straightway\r\nopened fire on the bird. The duck dodged the missiles like a flash,\r\nand every now and then renewed his attempts to fly; but, at length, a\r\nheavy piece of root struck him, and stretched him out lifeless on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed a strong, cheery voice. \"That's what I call\r\nshooting ducks under difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nArchie looked up and saw his cousin standing on the opposite side of\r\nthe creek, with his gun on one shoulder and two of the flock slung\r\nover the other.\r\n\r\n\"I came very near getting the start of you, after all--didn't I?\"\r\ncontinued Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Was that you shooting up there?\" inquired Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I had almost reached the swamp, when I happened to think that\r\nperhaps the ducks might be in the creek, so I turned back.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lucky circumstance for you. But I beat you, after all. I've got\r\nthree ducks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they? I don't see but two.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other is over there in the bushes, somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nFrank immediately commenced looking for it, and Archie procured a long\r\nbranch, and waded out as far as possible into the creek, and, after\r\nconsiderable exertion and a thorough wetting, succeeded in pulling\r\nboth of his ducks to the shore.\r\n\r\nDuring the three weeks that followed, the boys passed the time in\r\nvarious ways--sometimes hunting in the woods or on the river, but more\r\nfrequently working in the shop. They also spent considerable time in\r\nattending to their pets. The young otter proved to be the most\r\ninteresting little animal they had ever seen. He grew quite tame, and\r\nwhen the boys entered the room where he was kept, he would come toward\r\nthem, uttering a faint whine, and, if they seated themselves, he would\r\njump up into their laps, and search through their pockets for\r\nsomething to eat--such as bread or crackers, of which the boys always\r\ntook especial care to have a good supply.\r\n\r\nAt length they began to long for winter, and many were the\r\nspeculations as to when the \"first fell of snow\" would come. Their\r\ntraps were all in order, and they were impatient for an opportunity to\r\nmake use of them. Besides, they had agreed with George and Harry to\r\n\"go fox-hunting the very first time there was snow enough for\r\ntracking.\"\r\n\r\nA week more passed, and Thanksgiving Day came; and in the evening\r\nFrank and his cousin went down to visit George and Harry, intending,\r\nas they said, to \"stay only a few minutes.\" But Mr. Butler soon came\r\nin, and began to relate some of his \"sailor yarns,\" as he called them\r\n(for he was a retired sea-captain), and the boys became so interested\r\nin listening to them, that they did not notice how rapidly the time\r\nflew by, and it was ten o'clock before they knew it. They then bade\r\nthe Captain \"good-night.\" George and Harry, as usual, agreed to\r\naccompany them part of the way, and, when they reached the door, what\r\nwas their surprise to find the ground white with snow, and the air\r\nfilled with the rapidly-falling flakes.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have that fox-hunt to-morrow,\" exclaimed Harry, in delight.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we will,\" said Archie, \"and I wouldn't take ten dollars for\r\nmy chance of catching one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, if the snow doesn't melt,\" said Frank, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's always the way with you,\" said Archie. \"What makes you try\r\nto throw cold water on all our expectations, in that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't intend to,\" answered Frank, with a laugh; \"but, you know, we\r\nhave been disappointed very often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George, \"but I guess we are all right this time. It snows\r\npretty fast, and the air doesn't feel like a thaw or rain.\"\r\n\r\nFrank acknowledged this; and they walked along, talking about the\r\nexciting times they expected to have on the morrow, until they reached\r\nthe \"big elm\"--a large tree that stood leaning over the creek, just\r\nhalf-way between Captain Butler's and where Frank lived. Here George\r\nand Harry stopped, and, after promising to be at the cottage early on\r\nthe following morning, turned their faces homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe Grayhound Outgeneraled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at an early hour, George and Harry arrived at the\r\ncottage, and, after a light and hastily-eaten breakfast, they set out.\r\nFrank and Harry were armed, as usual, with their guns, while the\r\nothers carried axes. They crossed the meadow at the back of the\r\norchard, passed through the cornfield which had been the scene of the\r\n'coon-hunt, a few weeks before, and struck out through the woods. The\r\ndogs were then sent out ahead, and they had not gone more than half a\r\nmile, when Sport uttered a long, loud howl, and, when the boys came up\r\nwith him, he was running impatiently about with his nose close to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"A fox has been along here,\" said Frank, bending over and examining a\r\ntrack in the snow, \"and the trail looks fresh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunt 'em up! hunt 'em up!\" shouted Archie, excitedly, waving his hand\r\nto the dogs.\r\n\r\nSport bounded off on the track like a shot, and Lightfoot followed\r\nclose after. Brave barked and howled furiously, and acted as if he\r\nwished very much to accompany them; but the swift hounds would have\r\ndistanced him in a moment.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that it was the intention of the boys to\r\nfollow up the hounds--that would have been worse than useless. Perhaps\r\nthe chase would continue for several hours. They had once hunted a fox\r\nall day, without coming in sight of him. Reynard has ways and habits\r\nof his own, which a person who has had experience in hunting him\r\nunderstands. He always runs with the wind, and generally follows a\r\nridge. The hunters take advantage of this, and \"run cross-lots\" to\r\nmeet him, sometimes gaining on him several miles in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe moment the hounds had disappeared on the trail, Frank--who knew\r\nall the \"run-ways\" of the game like a book--led the way through the\r\nwoods toward a ridge that lay about a mile distant, where they\r\nexpected the fox would pass.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour's run brought them to this ridge, and they began\r\nto conceal themselves behind trees and bushes, when Archie suddenly\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"We're dished, boys. The fox has already passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" said Frank. \"No time to lose. We must try again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he again led the way, on a keen run, through a strip of woods,\r\nacross a wide meadow toward another ridge, that lay fully three miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nAt length the baying of the hounds echoed through the woods, far below\r\nthem. Louder and louder it grew, and, in a few moments, they swept up\r\nthe ridge in full cry. The boys hurried on as rapidly as possible, and\r\nreached the ridge in about an hour. Although they were accustomed to\r\nsuch sport, they were pretty well tired out. They had run the greater\r\npart of the way through thick woods, filled with fallen logs and\r\ntangled bushes; but they now felt confident that the hunt was nearly\r\nover. They knew they had gained considerably on the fox, and his\r\ncapture would be an ample reward for their trouble.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the ridge, they threw themselves rapidly\r\nacross it in all directions, and, to their delight, discovered that\r\nthe fox had not yet passed. They stationed themselves in such a manner\r\nthat it would be impossible for him to pass on either side of them\r\nwithout coming within reach of their guns, and patiently awaited his\r\nappearance. They had not remained long in this position, when Archie,\r\nwho was stationed lowest down the ridge, exclaimed in a subdued voice,\r\n\r\n\"There they come, boys! Now, look sharp!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys listened intently, and heard, faint and far off, the\r\nwell-known bay of Sport. It was sharp and short--very different from\r\nthe note he had uttered when the chase first commenced. Louder and\r\nlouder grew the noise, as the hounds came rapidly up the ridge toward\r\nthe place where the boys were stationed, and every one was on the\r\nalert, expecting every moment to see the fox break cover.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud howl blended with Sport's baying, and the hounds\r\nseemed to turn and sweep down the valley.\r\n\r\n\"The fox has left the ridge, boys,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Then we're dished again,\" exclaimed Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" continued Frank. \"He will have to go across the meadow,\r\nand will run the risk of being caught by Lightfoot. We must try and\r\ncut him off.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he led the way down the ridge, in the direction the chase was\r\ntending.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the hounds broke out into a continuous cry, and, when\r\nthe boys emerged from the woods, they saw them standing at the foot of\r\na tall stump, which stood near the middle of the meadow.\r\n\r\nBrave immediately ran to join them, and Harry exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know what those dogs are doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they've got the fox treed,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"A fox treed!\" repeated Harry, with a laugh, \"Whoever heard of such a\r\nthing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often read,\" answered Frank, \"that when a fox is hard pressed,\r\nand finds himself unable to escape, he will take advantage of any\r\nplace of concealment he can find.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, the boys had been running toward\r\nthe stump, and, when they reached it, they found Brave with his head\r\nburied in a hole near the ground, now and then giving his tail a jerk,\r\nbut otherwise remaining as motionless as a statue.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think now of the possibility of seeing a fox?\" inquired\r\nFrank, turning to Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it yet,\" said the latter.\r\n\r\n\"Then how is it that the dogs are here?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fox may have run down here and doubled on his trail, and thus\r\nthrown the dogs off the scent.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't have time to do that,\" said Archie, who had divested\r\nhimself of his coat, and stood with his ax, ready to cut down the\r\nstump. \"He's in here, I'm certain. See how Brave acts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not take long to find out,\" said George, who was a good deal\r\nof his brother's opinion that the fox was not in the tree.\r\n\r\nAnd he and Archie set to work, with the intention of cutting it down.\r\nBut it was found to be hollow; and, after taking out a few chips,\r\nArchie stooped down to take a survey of the interior, and spied the\r\nfox crouched in the darkest corner.\r\n\r\n\"Hand me your gun, Frank,\" said he; \"I'll shoot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't shoot him,\" said Frank. \"It is a good time to try\r\nLightfoot's speed. Let's get the fox out, and give him a fair start,\r\nand if he gets away from the hound, he is entitled to his life.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys readily agreed to this proposal--not out of any desire to\r\ngive the fox a chance for his liberty, but in order to witness a fair\r\ntrial of the grayhound's speed, and to enjoy the excitement of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry provided themselves with long poles, with which to\r\n\"poke\" the fox out of his refuge. Brave and Sport were unceremoniously\r\nconducted away from the tree, and ordered to \"lie down;\" and Frank\r\ntook hold of the grayhound, intending to restrain him until the fox\r\ncould get a fair start.\r\n\r\n\"All ready now,\" said Archie. \"Keep a good look-out, Frank, and let\r\nthe hound go the instant the fox comes out. You know, Lightfoot is\r\nyoung yet, and it won't do to give the game too long a start.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd he tightened his grasp on the strong, impatient animal, which\r\nstruggled desperately to free himself, while George and Harry began\r\nthe work of \"poking out the fox.\" They thrust their poles into the\r\nholes they had cut in the roots of the stump, and the next moment out\r\npopped the fox, and started toward the woods like a streak of light.\r\n\r\nThe meadow was about a mile and a half square, and was laid off in\r\n\"dead furrows\"--deep ditches, which are dug, about four rods apart, to\r\ndrain off the water. The fox took to the bank of one of these furrows,\r\nand followed it at a rate of speed which the boys had never seen\r\nequaled.\r\n\r\nThe moment Lightfoot discovered him, he raised himself on his\r\nhind-legs, and struggled and fought furiously. But Frank would not\r\nrelease him in that position, for fear the hound would \"throw\"\r\nhimself; and he commenced striking him on the head, to compel him, if\r\npossible, to place his fore-feet on the ground, but all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the struggle, short as it was, the fox had gained nearly thirty\r\nrods. Archie was not slow to notice this, and he shouted to his\r\ncousin,\r\n\r\n\"Let him go! let him go! The fox has too long a start already.\"\r\n\r\nFrank accordingly released the hound, which made an enormous bound,\r\nand, as Frank had expected, he landed, all in a heap, in one of the\r\ndead furrows, and, before he could recover himself, the fox had\r\ngained two or three rods more. But when the hound was fairly started,\r\nhis speed was astonishing. He settled down nobly to his work, and\r\nmoved over the ground as lightly as if he had been furnished with\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nHad he been a well-trained dog, the boys would have felt no concern\r\nwhatever as to the issue of the race; but, as it was, they looked upon\r\nthe escape of the fox as a very probable thing. The fox was still\r\nfollowing the dead furrow, and Lightfoot, instead of pursuing directly\r\nafter him, as he ought to have done, took to another furrow which ran\r\nparallel to the one the fox was following, and about four rods from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe fox had a good start, but the enormous bounds of the greyhound\r\nrapidly lessened the distance between them; he gained at every step,\r\nand finally overtook him, and the two animals were running side by\r\nside, and only four rods apart.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the cunning fox turned, and started off exactly at right\r\nangles with the course he had been following. The gray hound, of\r\ncourse, had not been expecting this, and he made a dozen of his long\r\nbounds before he could turn himself. During this time the fox gained\r\nseveral rods.\r\n\r\nAs before, the hound pursued a course parallel with that of the fox,\r\ninstead of following directly after him.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were again running side by side, but this time\r\nfurther apart than before. Again and again the fox turned, each time\r\nnearing the woods, and gaining considerably; and finally, reaching the\r\nend of the meadow, he cleared the fence at a bound, and disappeared in\r\nthe bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that's provoking!\" exclaimed Archie.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" answered Frank. \"I don't think the fox can go much\r\nfurther. He must be pretty well tired out, judging by the way he ran.\r\nHere, Sport!\" he continued, \"hunt 'em up!\"\r\n\r\nSport was off like a shot, and the boys followed after as fast as\r\ntheir legs could carry them.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the woods, they found Lightfoot beating about in the\r\nbushes, as if he expected to find the fox concealed among them. Sport\r\nwas standing over the trail of the fox, as motionless as if he had\r\nbeen turned into stone.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt 'em up!\" shouted Frank, again--\"hunt 'em up.\"\r\n\r\nThe hound uttered a loud bark, and instantly set off on the trail, and\r\nLightfoot, as before, followed close at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Frank, \"we must change our tactics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"A little further on, the ridge branches off, and\r\nthere is no knowing which one the fox will follow. Come, George, we\r\nwill go this way.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he turned and ran down into the meadow again.\r\n\r\n\"Run like blazes, now!\" shouted Frank.\r\n\r\nAnd, suiting the action to the word, he turned off in the opposite\r\ndirection, and led the way through the woods at a rate which made\r\nArchie wonder. They ran along in \"Indian file\"--Brave bringing up the\r\nrear--for almost two miles, through the thickest part of the woods,\r\nwhen they again found themselves on the ridge. After ascertaining that\r\nthe fox had not yet passed, they took their stations.\r\n\r\n\"I would really like to know which way that fox went,\" said Archie,\r\npanting hard after his long run.\r\n\r\n\"I am almost certain that he took to the other ridge,\" answered Frank.\r\n\"I think we should have heard the hound before this time, if he had\r\nturned this way.\"\r\n\r\nThey remained in their places of concealment for almost an hour,\r\nwithout hearing any sounds of the chase, and Frank said,\r\n\r\n\"We might as well start for home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dished again, are we?\" said Archie, in a deprecating tone. \"That's\r\ntoo bad! Well,\" he continued, \"we can't always be the fortunate ones,\r\nbut I wish I could have had the pleasure of shooting that fox. But\r\nwhich way do we go to get home?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go exactly south,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Which way is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will soon tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Frank drew a small compass from his pocket, and, in a moment,\r\ncontinued,\r\n\r\n\"This is the way. Come on!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he turned his face, as Archie thought, directly _from_ home, and\r\nstruck boldly out. Their long run had taxed their endurance to the\r\nutmost. If they had \"been in practice,\" they would have looked upon it\r\nas merely a \"little tramp;\" for, during the previous winter, they had\r\noften followed a fox all day without experiencing any serious\r\ninconvenience; but, as this was the first exercise of the kind they\r\nhad had for almost a year, they felt the effects of it pretty\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nArchie, who had lived in the city during the summer, was \"completely\r\nused up,\" as he expressed it; and his cousin was weary and footsore;\r\nand it seemed as though neither of them had sufficient strength left\r\nto take another step.\r\n\r\nThey kept on, hour after hour, however, without once stopping to rest;\r\nand, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they climbed over the fence\r\nthat inclosed Uncle Mike's pasture, and came in sight of the cottage.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Harry were sitting on the piazza, and, as soon as they came\r\nwithin speaking distance, the latter held up the fox, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"We were lucky, for once in our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had been five minutes later, we should have lost him,\" said\r\nGeorge, as Frank and his cousin came up to where the brothers were\r\nsitting. \"We reached the ridge just in the 'nick of time,' The fox was\r\njust passing, and Harry brought him down by a chance shot. Here,\r\nFrank,\" he continued, \"you take the fox; we have no use for him.\"\r\n\r\nFrank thanked him; and the boys then went into the house, and, after\r\ndinner, the brothers started for home.\r\n\r\nFrank and his cousin went into the study, and the former selected his\r\nfavorite book from his library, and settled himself in an easy-chair\r\nbefore the fire; while Archie stretched himself on the bed, and was\r\nfast asleep in a moment.\r\n\r\nAnd here, reader, we will leave them reposing after their long run;\r\nbut we hope soon to introduce them again in works entitled, \"FRANK IN\r\nTHE WOODS,\" and \"FRANK ON THE PRAIRIE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Frank, the Young Naturalist, by Harry Castlemon",
