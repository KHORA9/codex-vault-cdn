The\r\ndescriptions of these insects in the Transactions of the New Zealand\r\nInstitute, or in works published in Europe and America, are not easily\r\naccessible to the general reader, and are also much scattered and\r\nfragmentary. It was thought therefore that the time had arrived when\r\nthe information which might be useful to gardeners and tree-growers,\r\nas well as to students, might be summarized and brought together in a\r\ncompendious form, and the present volume is an attempt towards this.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this work complete a second volume is necessary,\r\nwhich should include the large number of other destructive insects\r\npreying upon various plants. For example, the \"pine-blight\"\r\n(_Kermaphis_), the \"American blight\" (_Eriosoma_), the \"black leech\"\r\n(_Tenthredo_), the cabbage caterpillar, the turnip \"fly,\" the various\r\naphides on roses, geraniums, &c., the grass-grub (_Odontria_), the\r\ncodlin-moth, the borers, weevils, wireworms, and a number of others are\r\nin different places damaging trees and plants, and it would be useful\r\nto collect in one volume information regarding them. The author has had\r\nin contemplation the preparation of such a volume, and it is hoped that\r\nit may be at some future time published.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the present is offered as, at least as far as it goes, a full\r\ndescription of one of the most general as well as the most noxious\r\nfamilies of plant-parasites. The plates have been especially prepared\r\nwith a double object: first, that gardeners and tree-growers might be\r\nable easily to recognize the kind of insect which might happen to\r\nbe damaging their plants; and, secondly, that the student who should\r\ndesire to know more of this curious family might have enough details\r\nindicated to guide him in his investigation. For the first purpose\r\nthe figures have been coloured as near to nature as possible; for the\r\nsecond a few anatomical details have been introduced. The printing\r\nof these plates has been executed by Mr. Potts, lithographer to Mr.\r\nA. Willis, of Wanganui, and it is hoped that the reader may be well\r\nsatisfied with the care and trouble which have been bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe author is sensible that this volume may contain numerous\r\nimperfections; but these will not, he trusts, be attributed to culpable\r\nignorance or carelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TERMS USED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Abdomen._ The posterior half of the body of male or female, whether\r\n       joined to the anterior half or slightly separated, segmented or\r\n       not.\r\n\r\n  _Abdominal cleft._ A narrow slit in the extremity of the abdomen of\r\n       Lecanidinæ and the full-grown _Hemicoccidinæ_ only. (Plate ix.,\r\n       Fig. 1, _b_, _c_.) On the upper side of the body are seen the\r\n\r\n  _Abdominal lobes_, two minute, divergent, triangular or conical,\r\n       excrescences, one on each side of the cleft, in _Lecanidinæ_,\r\n       usually bearing one or more hairs. (Plate xi., Fig. 3, _b_, _c_.)\r\n\r\n  _Abdominal spike._ A more or less long, tubular or semi-tubular,\r\n       pointed process terminating the abdomen of the male in all\r\n       species, and serving as a sheath for the penis, which is a long,\r\n       white, soft tube with recurved hairs. (Plate ii., Fig. 3; Plate\r\n       xxi., Fig. 1, _k_.)\r\n\r\n  _Anal ring, anogenital ring._ An orifice situated near the abdominal\r\n       extremity of the female, either simple or compound, hairless or\r\n       bearing several hairs. (Plate ii., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n  _Anal tubercles._ Exhibited only by the _Coccidinæ_ and by the larvæ\r\n       of _Hemicoccidinæ_: two more or less conspicuous projecting\r\n       processes at the abdominal extremity of the female, without any\r\n       cleft, and in most instances projecting beyond the edge; usually\r\n       bearing setæ. (Plate ii., Fig. 2, _c_, _d_.)\r\n\r\n  _Antennæ._ Two jointed organs (\"feelers\") projecting from the\r\n       anterior portion of the body, of variable length. (Plate i.,\r\n       Figs. 9, 10, 11, types.)\r\n\r\n  _Apodous._ Without feet.\r\n\r\n  _Apterous._ Without wings.\r\n\r\n  _Bucca_, _buccal_. The mouth; belonging to the mouth.\r\n\r\n  _Carina_, _carinated_. A keel or raised-ridge; keeled.\r\n\r\n  _Cephalic region._ That part of the insect, male or female, which\r\n       bears the eyes, antennæ, and mouth, but not including the first\r\n       pair of feet.\r\n\r\n  _Clavate._ Club-shaped; somewhat knobbed.\r\n\r\n  _Claw._ The hooked terminating joint of the foot. (Plate i., Fig. 6,\r\n       _cl._, type.)\r\n\r\n  _Coxa._ The first joint of the foot, springing directly from the\r\n       under-side of the thoracic region. (Plate i., Figs. 6 _c_, 7\r\n       _c_.)\r\n\r\n  _Digitules._ Appendages observed on the feet, and often useful for\r\n       distinguishing species. Usually there are two pairs. The \"upper\r\n       pair\" spring from the upper side of the extremity of the tarsus,\r\n       and are generally long, fine hairs, terminating in a knob. The\r\n       \"lower pair\" spring from the base of the claw, and are usually\r\n       broader and more trumpet-shaped than the upper ones. (Plate i.,\r\n       Fig. 8, type.) Sometimes either pair, or both, may be absent.\r\n       In _Cœlostoma wairoense_ there are no \"upper\" digitules, and 24\r\n       \"lower\" ones on the foot of the male. (Plate xxi.)\r\n\r\n  _Dimerous._ Two-jointed.\r\n\r\n  _Dorsum._ The upper side of the body when the insect is in its\r\n       natural position.\r\n\r\n  _Dorsal._ On the upper side or dorsum.\r\n\r\n  _Eyes._ Two coloured, granular or simple, round organs on the\r\n       cephalic region of the female, near the base of the antennæ\r\n       (Plate xiv., Fig. 2, _k_.; Plate xx., _b_); two, or four,\r\n       coloured, granular, simple or facetted, on the head of the male\r\n       (Plate i., Figs. 14, 15; Plate xxi., Fig. 2, _b_).\r\n\r\n  _Femur._ The second joint of the feet, next the coxa, joined to it by\r\n       the false joint \"trochanter.\" (Plate i., Figs. 6 _f_, 7 _f_.)\r\n\r\n  _Fringe._ A portion of the excreted substance, cotton or wax,\r\n       produced by the spinnerets on the edge of the body in certain\r\n       _Lecanidinæ_ and _Hemicoccidinæ_. It may be in the form of long\r\n       glassy threads (_Planchonia_) or of more or less broad flat\r\n       plates (_Ctenochiton_). (Plate vii., Figs. 2 _d_, 3 _a_; Plate\r\n       xii., Fig. 2, _a_, _b_, _c_.)\r\n\r\n  _Haltere._ A minute organ, situated just behind the wings of the\r\n       males, and of which the use, either in this family or in the\r\n       Diptera, has not been satisfactorily ascertained. It is often\r\n       termed the \"balancer.\" In the house-fly it has been thought\r\n       to represent an organ of hearing. In Coccids it is furnished\r\n       with one or more hooked bristles, and Mr. Comstock affirms that\r\n       these are, probably for some purposes of flight, hooked into the\r\n       posterior edges of the wings.[A] (Plate i., Fig. 17; Plate xxi.,\r\n       Fig. 1, _m_.)\r\n\r\n       [A] Report of the Entomologist, U.S. Dep. of Agric. 1880, p.\r\n       277, note.\r\n\r\n  _Honeydew._ A substance of a glutinous character produced by many\r\n       species, and falling in spray from them on the leaves. (See\r\n       Chap. III.)\r\n\r\n  _Larva._ The first stage in the insect's life after emerging from the\r\n       egg.\r\n\r\n  _Lobes_, in the _Diaspidinæ_, are minute, flat, more or less rounded\r\n       projections, two or more, seen on the edge of the abdominal\r\n       extremity, usually interspersed with spines and hairs (Plate\r\n       iii., Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, _l_); in the _Lecanidinæ_, are two\r\n       triangular or conical projections, usually bearing hairs, on the\r\n       dorsal side of the body, one on each side of the abdominal cleft\r\n       (Plate xi., Fig. 3, _b_, _c_).\r\n\r\n  _Mentum._ A kind of secondary rostrum, or \"under-lip,\" not altogether\r\n       tubular, but rather a deepish trough, through which the rostral\r\n       setæ pass after leaving the rostrum. It may have one, two, or\r\n       three joints. It is not noticeable in the Diaspidinæ. (Plate i.,\r\n       Fig. 5, _b_.)\r\n\r\n  _Metamorphosis._ A change of form. For the number and characters of\r\n       these see Chap. II.\r\n\r\n  _Moniliform._ Like a string of beads.\r\n\r\n  _Monomerous._ With a single joint.\r\n\r\n  _Multilocular._ With several divisions: a term applied to the\r\n       spinneret orifices of some insects, distinguishing them from\r\n       \"simple\" orifices, which show only a single tube. Multilocular\r\n       orifices exhibit a bundle of tubes enclosed together. (Plate i.,\r\n       Fig. 4, _c_, _d_, _p_; Plate xviii., Fig. 2, _e_.)\r\n\r\n  _Nervure._ A strong vein which, starting from the attachment of the\r\n       wing of the male, runs along the anterior edge of the wing,\r\n       a little within it: at about half its length a branch runs\r\n       obliquely towards the posterior edge. (Plate i., 16; Plate xix.,\r\n       _f_; Plate xxi.)\r\n\r\n  _Normal._ According to rule--not exceptional.\r\n\r\n  _Ocelli._ Two, four, or six minute circular simple organs, on\r\n       the head of the male: probably organs of vision. In the\r\n       _Monophlebidæ_ they would seem to be replaced by a smooth\r\n       rounded protuberance behind the eye. (Plate i., Fig. 14, _oc._;\r\n       Plate viii., Fig. 2, _k_, _m_; Plate xxi., Fig. 2, _b_.)\r\n\r\n  _Ovisac._ The cottony bag or nest formed by certain species of\r\n       _Lecanidinæ_ and _Coccidinæ_ for the reception of their eggs.\r\n       (Plate xii., Fig. 1, _a_, _b_, _c_; Plate xix., _a_, _b_, _c_.)\r\n\r\n  _Peduncle_, _pedunculated_. A stalk; stalked.\r\n\r\n  _Pellicle._ The skin of an earlier stage, cast off at each\r\n       metamorphosis; used by the _Diaspidinæ_ and by one genus of\r\n       _Lecanidinæ_ in the formation of the puparium or test. (Plate\r\n       i., Fig. 3, _a_, _b_; Plate vii., Fig. 2, _b_.)\r\n\r\n  _Polymerous._ Many-jointed.\r\n\r\n  _Pupa._ The last stage of the male insect before emerging winged.\r\n\r\n  _Puparium._ The shield, covering, or \"scale\" of the _Diaspidinæ_.\r\n       (Plate i., Fig. 3, e; Plates iv., v., vi.)\r\n\r\n  _Rostral setæ._ Three or, in a few cases, four long, fine, curling,\r\n       tubular bristles springing from the rostrum, and often passing\r\n       through a mentum; used for insertion into the tissues of a plant\r\n       and sucking their contents. (Plate i., Fig. 5; Plate vi., only\r\n       one being here shown, from the smallness of the drawings.)\r\n\r\n  _Rostrum._ A more or less conical, tubular, projecting organ, or\r\n       beak, protruding from the under-side of the cephalic region, or\r\n       between the first pair of feet. It is absent in the adult female\r\n       _Cœlostoma_. It is the \"mouth\" of the insect. (Plate i., Fig. 5;\r\n       Plate iv., Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\n  _Sac._ The cottony, bag-like covering or nest produced by the\r\n       spinnerets and concealing the insect in many of the _Coccidinæ_\r\n       and some _Lecanidinæ_. (Plate xv., Fig. 1, _c_; Fig. 2, _b_.)\r\n\r\n  _Scale._ The shield or puparium of the _Diaspidinæ_. The word is\r\n       commonly used to designate the outward appearance of insects\r\n       of the whole family, which are indiscriminately called\r\n       \"scale-insects,\" although many of them form no shield whatever.\r\n\r\n  _Secretion_ may be of various kinds. It is matter produced by\r\n       internal organs, and expelled through the \"spinnerets.\" In the\r\n       _Diaspidinæ_ the secreted portion of the puparium (that is, all\r\n       except the pellicles) is made up of fine, closely-woven fibres,\r\n       forming the \"scale.\" In the _Lecanidinæ_ it probably exudes\r\n       originally as fine fibres, but these become agglomerated in\r\n       some cases in a waxy or horny mass, or in others are loosely\r\n       collected as cotton. In the _Coccidinæ_ the secretion is\r\n       usually cottony, or powdery like meal. _Cœlostoma_ secretes all\r\n       three--wax, cotton, and meal. In some instances, as in _Carteria\r\n       lacca_, of Africa, the wax, called \"shellac,\" is abundant enough\r\n       to be commercially valuable; or, as in the Chinese _Ericerus\r\n       Pe-la_ it can be used for making candles.\r\n\r\n  _Seta._ A bristle--a long stiff hair.\r\n\r\n  _Setose._ Bearing a few bristles.\r\n\r\n  _Spinnerets._ Organs observed in various parts of the body,\r\n       producing the waxy, cottony, or mealy matter. They consist\r\n       of cylindrical internal tubes, sometimes ending on the skin,\r\n       sometimes protruding outside it in the form of tubes, spines,\r\n       or conical hairs. In the former case the orifices show them to\r\n       be in some instances simple, and in others compound tubes.[B]\r\n       In the _Diaspidinæ_, besides being scattered over the body,\r\n       the spinnerets are arranged in groups on the last abdominal\r\n       segment, and these groups afford excellent characters for\r\n       specific distinctions. (Plate i., Fig. 4, for types of various\r\n       spinnerets; Plate iii., groups of spinnerets of _Diaspidinæ_.)\r\n\r\n       [B] Minute anatomical details are unsuitable for this work.\r\n       The student may consult Targioni-Tozzetti, \"Studie sulle\r\n       Cocciniglie,\" cap. ii., p. 26.\r\n\r\n  _Spiracles._ \"Breathing organs:\" the orifices in the body of the\r\n       tracheæ or tubes conveying air to the blood. In the _Lecanidinæ_\r\n       they are usually four; simple circles, near the edge of the\r\n       body, and with a few strong spiny hairs near them. In the\r\n       _Coccidinæ_ they are often numerous. (Plate ii., Fig. 4; Plate\r\n       xx., _n_.)\r\n\r\n  _Spiracular spines._ Spiny hairs, usually three in number, of which\r\n       one is rather long, close to the spiracles, in the _Lecanidinæ_.\r\n\r\n  _Stigma_, _stigmatic spines_. Terms sometimes employed for spiracles,\r\n       &c.\r\n\r\n  _Tarsus._ The fourth joint of the feet, between the tibia and the\r\n       claw. Its consisting of one joint (monomerous) is a distinctive\r\n       character of the whole family. (Plate i., Fig. 6, _ta_.; Fig. 7,\r\n       _ta_.)\r\n\r\n  _Test._ The waxy, glassy, or horny covering produced through the\r\n       spinnerets and concealing the insect in many _Lecanidinæ_ and\r\n       some _Coccidinæ_. In this work it is not applied to the \"scale\"\r\n       of _Diaspidinæ_ or to cottony secretions.\r\n\r\n  _Thoracic band._ An appearance seen on the thoracic region in the\r\n       male, looking like a broad transverse ribbon.\r\n\r\n  _Thoracic region_, _thorax_. That part of the female or the male\r\n       which bears the three pairs of feet, when the feet are present;\r\n       or, if the feet are absent, the middle portion of the body,\r\n       segmented or not.\r\n\r\n  _Tibia._ The third joint of the feet, next the femur. (Plate i., Fig.\r\n       6, _ti_.; Fig. 7, _ti_.)\r\n\r\n  _Tracheæ._ Tubes ramifying throughout the body, conveying air to the\r\n       blood. Their orifices are the spiracles. The tracheæ, as in\r\n       other insects, appear as if constructed of a network of fine\r\n       spiral wires. (Plate ii., Fig. 4 _d_; Plate xx., _n_.)\r\n\r\n  _Trochanter._ A small articulation, not a distinct joint (something\r\n       like a knee-cap) of the feet, between the coxa and the femur.\r\n       (Plate i., Fig. 6, _tr_.; Fig. 7, _tr_.)\r\n\r\n  _Trimerous._ Three-jointed.\r\n\r\n  _Ventral._ On the under-side, the insect being in its proper\r\n       position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND SCALE-INSECTS\r\n\r\n(COCCIDIDÆ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects are divided by naturalists into several principal orders, the\r\ndistinguishing marks of which are generally very well defined--for\r\nexample, the butterflies and moths belong to the order _Lepidoptera_,\r\nthe dragon-flies to the _Neuroptera_, the common house-flies to the\r\n_Diptera_, and so on. These orders are founded upon the characters\r\nand arrangement of the wings. They are subdivided into families, and\r\nthese again into genera and species. One of the orders is that of the\r\nHemiptera, which is composed of the two following sections:--\r\n\r\n Hemiptera-Heteroptera, including the bugs, water-beetles, &c.\r\n\r\n Hemiptera-Homoptera, including the crickets, cuckoo-spits,\r\n plant-lice (Aphides), leaf-hoppers (Psyllids), scale-insects\r\n (Coccids), &c.\r\n\r\nThe insects treated of in this volume are therefore placed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Class--Insecta.\r\n  Order--Hemiptera.\r\n  Section--Homoptera.\r\n  Family--Coccididæ.\r\n\r\nThe genera and species will be found in their places.\r\n\r\nThe common English name for this family--\"scale-insects\"--is not\r\nvery appropriate. Some few of them have the appearance of small thin\r\nscales on leaves or twigs, but many have not. Nor are the German\r\nappellations--\"gall-insekten\" or \"schild-lause\"--more appropriate.\r\nGardeners have given to some of them the name of \"mealy-bug,\" which,\r\nalthough decidedly neither elegant nor euphonious, very fairly\r\nrepresents the character of that particular portion of the family.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name \"Coccididæ,\" or, as abbreviated often in this\r\nvolume, \"Coccids,\" is found in the old Greek word \"[Greek: kokkos],\"\r\ndenoting a rich red dye, which was much admired by the Greeks and\r\nRomans, and which was procured from the insect now known as _Kermes\r\nvermilio_ (the _Coccus ilicis_ of Linnæus). When the cochineal insect\r\nwas discovered in Mexico it soon overpowered all the others, producing\r\ncommercial dyes, and from it has come the title \"Coccid,\" now applied\r\nto the whole family. Cochineal itself has of late years been pushed\r\naside to a great extent by the aniline (coal-tar) dyes; yet it is still\r\nused for many purposes. This insect lives on the leaves of cactus.\r\nAmongst the New Zealand species described in this work will be found\r\none, _Dactylopius alpinus_, which produces a red dye similar to, though\r\nprobably not equal to, cochineal. Before the discovery of aniline dyes\r\nit might possibly have been worth while to cultivate this insect for\r\nits dye; but this would scarcely answer now.\r\n\r\nThe Coccididæ are, in some parts of the world, very injurious to\r\nvegetation. They seem to affect principally the warmer temperate\r\nregions. California, Florida, the Cape of Good Hope, the southern parts\r\nof Australia, Southern France and Northern Italy, and New Zealand\r\nare countries in which they are found out-of-doors in the greatest\r\nnumbers. In England they are less troublesome in the open air, though\r\nin greenhouses and hothouses they abound; but, in places under glass,\r\nevery gardener ought to be able to get rid of them without difficulty.\r\nFor its extent New Zealand seems to furnish a larger number than any\r\nother country. The humidity of its climate and the absence of anything\r\nlike severe winters in most parts of it are quite congenial to Coccids;\r\nand there is scarcely a tree in its forests or in its gardens, whether\r\nnative or introduced, which is not subject to their attacks.\r\n\r\nIt has not been thought necessary to include in this work a list of\r\nthe books and essays written on this family of insects. The list would\r\nbe a very long one; but, besides that many of the books would not be\r\nobtainable here, it would be found that very many authors have done\r\nnothing more than copy--often quite blindly and unintelligently--what\r\nothers had said before them; moreover, most of them are out of date.\r\nThe student or the horticulturist desiring to know more about Coccids\r\nnot found in New Zealand may find full details in the reports of the\r\nAgricultural Department of the United States Government, in Dr. V.\r\nSignoret's \"Essai sur les Cochenilles\" (Paris), in papers by Miss Emily\r\nSmith (American naturalist, 1878-80), &c. The American Departmental\r\nReports of Professors Riley and Comstock, Mr. Hubbard, and Mr. L.\r\nHoward contain most valuable information. English works on the subject\r\nare mostly fragmentary or inaccurate; but Mr. Douglas, of Lewisham, has\r\nlately begun to discuss the Coccids in England in a systematic manner,\r\nand probably before long others will follow suit. In India, Mr. T. W.\r\nAtkinson, of Calcutta, is studying the family.\r\n\r\nNatural science in these days tends ever more and more towards\r\nspecialization, and the boundaries of scientific classes, orders,\r\nfamilies, &c., are becoming always more and more narrowed. The student\r\ncan find his time quite sufficiently occupied nowadays in the thorough\r\ninvestigation of so (comparatively) small a portion of the animal\r\nkingdom as is presented by the Coccids of even only one country; and\r\nthe present work may not be without value to future workers in this\r\ndirection. To the farmer, the gardener, the fruit-grower, and the owner\r\nof pleasure-grounds it is believed that the following chapters will\r\nalso supply information at the same time correct, intelligible, and\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS, LIFE-HISTORY, AND METAMORPHOSES OF THE COCCIDIDÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first principal character separating the Coccididæ from the rest of\r\nthe Homoptera, and distinguishable without microscopic examination, is\r\nthe absence of wings in the females at all stages of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe second principal character is the absence of any apparatus for\r\nfeeding and digesting in the males.\r\n\r\nFrom these two characters it follows that the females can only extend\r\ntheir operations by, at the best, crawling from plant to plant, or\r\nby being carried about by birds or other agency; also that the males\r\ncannot enjoy more than a very short existence, their work being\r\nentirely confined to impregnating the females. Hence, in any endeavours\r\nto destroy these insects, the males may be disregarded, and the females\r\nonly attended to.\r\n\r\nOther distinguishing characters, chiefly microscopic, are--\r\n\r\n1. The presence of only one joint in the tarsus or fourth joint of the\r\nleg, in both males and females (Plate i., Figs. 6 and 7, _ta_);\r\n\r\n2. The presence of only a single claw terminating the leg in both males\r\nand females (Plate i., Figs. 6 and 7);\r\n\r\n3. The presence of only two wings, with two halteres, in the full-grown\r\nmales (Plate xxi.);\r\n\r\n4. The presence of two or more eyes or ocular tubercles, in addition to\r\nthe ordinary pair of eyes, in the full-grown males (Plate i., Fig. 14;\r\nPlate viii., Fig. 1, _k_, _m_).\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Female Insect.\r\n\r\nIn general outward appearance the female insects present very variable\r\nforms. They may be either naked, or covered over with some kind of a\r\nshield, which may be fibrous, or waxy, or cottony, or they may have\r\nsimply a thin powdery meal scattered over them. The covered insects\r\nare, of course, stationary, although in some cases, before reaching\r\ntheir full development, they move about, carrying their houses with\r\nthem. The naked insects may be either stationary or active.\r\n\r\nThey attach themselves either to the bark or stem of a plant or to the\r\nleaves. In the latter case it is rare to find them on the upper side;\r\nbut, on turning over a leaf, the under-surface is frequently found\r\ncovered thickly with them.\r\n\r\nIn many cases they exude, in the form of minute globules, a whitish,\r\nthick, gummy secretion, answering probably to the \"honeydew\" of the\r\nAphididæ. This secretion drops from them on to the plant, and from it\r\ngrows a black fungus, which soon gives an unsightly appearance to the\r\nplant. This fungus or \"smut\" is an almost invariable indication that a\r\nplant is attacked by insects,[C] and may, indeed, give a useful warning\r\nto tree-growers. It is not, however, produced in appreciable quantities\r\nby all species.\r\n\r\n[C] Not necessarily a Coccid insect: the fungus may also grow on the\r\nhoneydew of Aphis; but it is easy to recognize the difference between\r\nthese insects. In every case there is some insect at work where the\r\nfungus is.\r\n\r\nThe manner of feeding upon the plant is the same as in all the families\r\nof Homoptera--namely, by means of a protruding rostrum, beak, or trunk,\r\nsituated on the under-side of the insect. As there is not, in the\r\nfemale Coccididæ, any well-defined division between the head and the\r\nrest of the body, this rostrum is seen, on turning over the insect, in\r\nthe form, usually, of a minute conical projection between, or nearly\r\nbetween, the first pair of legs, if the legs are present, or a little\r\nwithin the circumference, if the legs are absent (Plate i., Fig. 5).\r\nAn ordinary lens will generally show, springing from the point of the\r\nconical rostrum, three or four longish, very fine, curling bristles.\r\nThese bristles are, in fact, hollow tubes, and the insect, inserting\r\nthem into the leaf or bark of the plant, sucks through them its food.\r\nIt is thus plain that, with often great numbers of scale-insects\r\nsucking at it--pumping, as it were, its life-blood through their\r\nrostra--a plant must of necessity suffer greatly.\r\n\r\nBirds do not, as a rule, seem to care much about eating the Coccididæ,\r\nwhose work is thus little interfered with by them. The \"white-eye\"\r\n(Zosterops) or \"blight-bird\" has been seen feeding on scale-insects;\r\nbut its visits are few and far between, and its assistance to the\r\ngardener in this respect not great. The Coccididæ are, however, much\r\nsubject to attacks from Hymenopterous parasites, of which some account\r\nwill be found in a subsequent chapter (Chap. IV.).\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Coccididæ are not confined altogether to damage to\r\nplants: there are some species producing materials useful to man. For\r\nexample, _Coccus cacti_ produces cochineal; _Carteria lacca_ produces\r\nshellac; _Ericerus pé-la_ is used by the Chinese for candles: and\r\nothers might be mentioned. But, so far, no New Zealand species appears\r\nto be of any commercial use. _Dactylopius alpinus_ makes a rather rich\r\nred dye in alcohol; _Cælostoma zealandicum_ constructs thick, waxy\r\ncoverings, which might possibly be turned to some account; but even\r\nthese are probably not worth much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Groups._\r\n\r\nThe groups into which the Coccididæ are, in this work, divided are as\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n  1. Female insects constructing for themselves shields\r\n       composed partly of secretion, partly of the pellicles\r\n       discarded from earlier stages; abdomen not cleft; legs\r\n       lost at full growth.\r\n                                                           Diaspidinæ.\r\n\r\n  2. Female insects naked, or covered with shields of\r\n       secretion, either waxy, horny, cottony, or felted;\r\n       abdomen in all stages cleft; legs either lost or\r\n       retained at full growth.\r\n                                                           Lecanidinæ.\r\n\r\n  3. Female insects naked, or covered with shields of waxy\r\n       secretion; abdomen of larva ending in prominent\r\n       processes, abdomen of adult cleft; legs either lost or\r\n       retained at full growth.\r\n                                                        Hemicoccidinæ.\r\n\r\n  4. Female insects naked, or covered with secretion either\r\n       waxy, cottony, or felted; abdomen in all stages ending\r\n       in prominent processes; legs either lost or retained\r\n       at full growth.\r\n                                                            Coccidinæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life-history._\r\n\r\nThe life-history of the insects in the above groups is as follows:--\r\n\r\nAll of them pass through four stages of existence: 1, the egg; 2, the\r\nyoung larva; 3, the second stage of life, or \"pupa;\" 4, the adult, or\r\nfull-grown insect.\r\n\r\n1. _The egg._ This is, in all cases, of regularly-oval form, the colour\r\nvarying from white to yellow or red (see Plate i., Fig. 1). It may be\r\nproduced in great numbers, and in some cases several times in a year.\r\nAs a general rule, the female ejects the eggs from her body; but there\r\nare some species, notably in the group _Lecanidinæ_, where the eggs are\r\nhatched within the body, the insect being thus, in a manner, viviparous.\r\n\r\n2. _The young larva_ (Plate i., Fig. 2). This is of precisely the same\r\nform both for the male and the female--or, rather, perhaps it should be\r\nsaid that no definite character has yet been discovered to show which\r\nare male and which are female larvæ. Neglecting slight variations of\r\nform, the larva is very minute--seldom more than about 1/30 in. long,\r\noften as small as 1/100 in.--oval, flattish, possessing a rostrum and\r\naccompanying bristles (setæ), six legs, and two antennæ: and in all\r\nspecies it is fairly active, travelling as soon as hatched over the\r\nplant in search of food.\r\n\r\n3. _The second stage._ Here the first distinction is noticeable between\r\nthe male and the female in most cases; but this distinction usually\r\ndepends not so much upon the form of the insect as upon the character\r\nof the covering it makes for itself. Confining ourselves at present to\r\nthe female, there are differences now noticeable between the groups.\r\nIn the _Diaspidinæ_ the insect begins by slipping out of the skin of\r\nthe larva; but it does not cast it aside altogether: it makes use of\r\nthe old skin as part of its covering. Adding to it a small portion\r\nof fibrous secretion--produced by organs called \"spinnerets,\" which\r\nwill be noticed presently--it attaches itself to the plant by its\r\nrostrum and setæ, and lies, inert and stationary, under a little shield\r\ncomposed half of its old skin and half of secretion. As it also, in\r\nentering this stage, loses its legs altogether, it must remain in the\r\nposition it has chosen for the rest of its life. In the _Lecanidinæ_\r\nand in the _Coccidinæ_ the skin of the larva is thrown away altogether,\r\nand the female in her second stage takes up a new position, in which\r\nshe may be either naked or covered with a thin coat of secretion,\r\nactive or stationary, retaining her legs in most cases, or losing\r\nthem in some instances. In all the groups there is almost always some\r\napproach to the form of the full-grown insect noticeable in this second\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n4. _The full-grown insect._ Here there is almost unlimited variety\r\nof form, colour, and habits. The insects may be naked or covered,\r\nactive or stationary. In the _Diaspidinæ_ the process just described\r\nis repeated: the female slips out of her second skin, but still keeps\r\nboth it and the first over her, adding more fibrous secretion from the\r\nspinnerets; so that, in fact, she lies an inert, legless, slug-like\r\nobject, under a covering composed partly of the two skins, partly of\r\nsecretion. (See Plate i., Fig. 3: _a_ is the discarded larval skin, _b_\r\nthe discarded skin of the second stage, both being used as part of the\r\nshield. In the genus _Aspidiotus_ these skins would be in the centre\r\ninstead of at one end.) In the _Lecanidinæ_ (except in one single\r\ngenus) and the _Coccidinæ_ the second skin is discarded altogether;\r\nbut the insect may either construct a new shield or remain naked, may\r\nbe either with or without legs, either active or stationary. Once this\r\nlast stage of her existence entered upon, the female prepares for\r\nlaying her eggs. In most species the services of a male are needed; in\r\nsome, as far as can be made out after investigation of many years, no\r\nmales are found. The female, if naked, either hatches her eggs in her\r\nown body or lays them on the plant; if covered, she fills her shield\r\nwith the eggs. The naked insects often cover the eggs themselves--e.g.,\r\n_Lecanium hemisphæricum_; or, again, deposit them in an ovisac, a\r\nmass of cottony secretion--e.g., _Pulvinaria camellicola_ or _Icerya\r\npurchasi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Male Insect.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked above that, as the full-grown males of the\r\n_Coccididæ_ are destitute of any organs for feeding whatsoever, there\r\nis no reason for making systematic attacks on them for economical\r\npurposes. Their function is simply to impregnate the females, and their\r\nlife at this stage must necessarily be very brief. It will suffice\r\nin this place to observe that in all cases these males are small,\r\ntwo-winged flies, their size varying from about 1/40 in. to 1/4 in.\r\nin length; colour usually yellow or red; wings longer than the body,\r\nhyaline (glassy) and often iridescent, and, in repose, lying flat,\r\npartly crossing each other. The antennæ are long, slender, and hairy,\r\nconsisting of nine or ten joints. The legs are also slender and hairy,\r\nthe tarsus having only one joint, and terminating in a single claw. The\r\ninsects are generally very active. Types of antenna, foot, wing and\r\nhaltere, and a diagram of the arrangement of the eyes and ocelli, are\r\ngiven in Plate i., Figs. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.\r\n\r\nThe males are thus so small and rapid in their movements that it is\r\ndifficult in most cases to find them in a free state. The usual way to\r\nprocure them is by hatching them from the pupæ. In their course of life\r\nthey pass through four stages, as do the females--viz.: 1, the egg; 2,\r\nthe larva; 3, the pupa; 4, the full-grown insect.\r\n\r\n1. _The egg_ is, as far as can be made out, precisely the same as that\r\nof the female, though Dr. Signoret believes that in one or two species\r\nthere may perhaps be minute differences.\r\n\r\n2. _The larva_ is, as stated above, similar to that of the female.\r\n\r\n3. _The pupa._ Here the first distinctions between the sexes may be\r\nnoted, and these are principally observable in the cocoons or puparia,\r\nrather than in the insect itself--at least to outward appearance.\r\nThe male pupa is, in all cases--even in those where the female pupa\r\nis naked--enclosed in some kind of covering. In the _Diaspidinæ_ the\r\npuparium is formed partly of fibrous secretion and partly of discarded\r\nskin; only, as the full-grown male emerges from it as a fly, and does\r\nnot remain on the plant, there can be only one such skin--that of the\r\nlarva; consequently it is easy to distinguish the male puparia from\r\nthe shields of the adult females by the presence of only one discarded\r\npellicle instead of two. In the _Lecanidinæ_ and the _Coccidinæ_\r\nthe male puparia are distinguishable usually by a narrower and more\r\ncylindrical form than those of the females, where these latter are\r\ncovered; in the naked species the males are generally in white waxy or\r\ncottony cocoons.\r\n\r\nExamination of the pupæ in these coverings will generally show more or\r\nless developed processes on the back and sides, which are so evidently\r\nthe rudiments of the future wings that the presence of a male is\r\nnot doubtful. In other respects the male pupæ are not always to be\r\ndistinguished from the females.\r\n\r\n3. _The full-grown male_ has been described above. It is usually\r\neasy to procure specimens, provided the pupæ are obtained. If any of\r\nthese, in their coverings, are put into pillboxes with glass tops, or\r\nany place where light reaches them, they will generally produce the\r\nfull-grown insect sometimes in a few days, sometimes after several\r\nweeks. The time of year for this seems very variable. Males emerge from\r\nthe puparia apparently indifferently (in New Zealand) in summer or\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS OF THE COCCIDIDÆ.\r\n\r\n[Waxy or cottony matter: the \"honeydew\" and the black fungus--\"smut\" or\r\n\"black blight\"--growing upon it.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coccididæ, in some parts of the world, excrete various substances\r\nwhich are of commercial value, as, for example, shellac, \"manna,\"\r\ncandle-wax, &c. Cochineal is not in the same category, as it appears\r\nto be a colouring-matter pervading every cell of the tissues of the\r\ninsect from which it is extracted--_Coccus cacti_. But there is no need\r\nto dwell here upon the ordinary excretions of the New Zealand insects,\r\nas they appear to be not sufficient either in quantity or quality\r\nfor any practical service. The fibrous puparia of the _Diaspidinæ_\r\nappear to be quite useless. The tests of the _Lecanodiaspidæ_, such as\r\n_Ctenochiton perforatus_, _Inglisia ornata_, &c., although more or less\r\nwaxy (but of very brittle material, often more like glass) are much too\r\ninsignificant to repay any trouble taken to collect them. Of all the\r\nfamily, _Cælostoma zælandicum_, in its second stage, seems to produce\r\nthe greatest amount of material, its large, hard, waxy tests being\r\nvery thick and solid, and often clustered in hundreds on a root or a\r\ntwig of Muhlenbeckia; but, supposing this substance (of which the true\r\nchemical nature[D] is not yet known) to be fit for some purpose, there\r\ndoes not seem to be any means of cultivating the insect to profit.\r\n_Dactylopius alpinus_ produces in alcohol a rich red tint, and this not\r\nby way of excretion, but from the colouring matters of its tissues,\r\nas in the case of _Coccus cacti_; but here, again, the rarity of the\r\ninsect and its out-of-the-way habitat would be a bar, even if nowadays\r\nit were worth while to cultivate a New Zealand cochineal. At present,\r\ntherefore, there seems no reason to believe that the Coccididæ of this\r\ncountry are likely to furnish any products of a useful or commercial\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[D] A small quantity was submitted to Mr. Skey, Colonial Museum\r\nLaboratory, for analysis, no more being available at the time. Mr. Skey\r\nconsidered it as a new substance, probably of the nature of a gum, not\r\nresinous; but further examination of larger quantities is necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one substance produced by these insects which has an\r\ninjurious effect upon the plants they grow on. This is a transparent\r\nglutinous fluid, apparently analogous to that exuding from Aphides,\r\nand which may receive the name of \"honeydew,\" as in that family. In\r\nfact, this fluid would seem to be produced by most of the Rhynchota,\r\nfor the Psyllidæ and Aleurodidæ also excrete it. The quantity issuing\r\nfrom Coccids seems to vary greatly. In some cases--e.g., _Lecanium\r\nhesperidum_, _Ctenochiton viridis_ or _perforatus_, _Fiorinia\r\nasteliæ_--the insects appear to discharge \"honeydew\" freely; in\r\nothers--e.g., _Mytilaspis pomorum_, _Rhizococcus fossor_--none, or\r\nscarcely any fluid, is excreted. But in no case does it appear that\r\nour Coccids[E] form honeydew to the same extent as the Aphides, which\r\nare stated to produce sometimes quantities that may be gathered from\r\nthe leaves or the soil by the pound weight. It is not so much the\r\namount exuding from each insect as the great number of insects on a\r\nplant which renders the Coccid honeydew obnoxious: each individual may\r\nexcrete only a little, but when, as usually happens, there are many\r\nhundreds of individuals together, the result, for the reasons given\r\nbelow, becomes important to the tree.\r\n\r\n[E] _Gossyparia mannipara_, an Arabian Coccid, is said to excrete so much\r\nthat the Arabs \"eat it with their bread like honey.\" Buckton, \"Brit.\r\nAphides,\" Vol. I., p. 42.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the honeydew of Coccididæ is of\r\nsimilar character to that of the Aphididæ, and, according to analyses\r\nby Boussingault, of Paris, and Gunning, of Amsterdam (Buckton, \"Brit.\r\nAphides,\" Vol. I., pp. 42, 43), the Aphidian honeydew contains a very\r\nlarge quantity of sugar, and, curiously enough, cane-sugar. Some\r\nobservers, noticing in its composition also glucose and dextrine, have\r\nconsidered it as of vegetable rather than animal origin; but the weight\r\nof evidence appears to make it certainly the product of the Aphides.\r\nAs the present work is intended rather as a manual for gardeners and\r\ntree-growers than as a purely scientific publication, there is no\r\nneed to enter more fully into the subject here: it may therefore be\r\nsimply stated that the honeydew of Coccididæ probably contains a large\r\nproportion of sugar in various forms.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which this substance is excreted by the insects differs\r\nsomewhat from that of the Aphididæ. On the abdomen of Aphis are\r\nseen two erect more or less prominent tubes, called \"cornicles\"\r\nor \"nectaries,\" and it is the function of these to excrete the\r\nhoneydew.[F] No European entomologist has, it is believed, seen or\r\ndescribed the organ of honeydew-excretion in the Coccididæ. Some\r\nobservations by the author of this work in 1886 demonstrate its\r\nexistence as a cylindrical tube exserted from the anogenital orifice\r\nafter the manner of a telescope, the furthest-extended tube being the\r\nmost slender. This organ, extremely difficult of detection when not in\r\nuse--except in the single genus _Cœlostoma_--is at intervals pushed\r\nout to its full extent, and at its further extremity there appears\r\na minute globule of yellowish, nearly transparent, glutinous fluid,\r\nwhich rapidly expands like a soap-bubble, and then, suddenly breaking,\r\nfalls in spray on the leaf beneath. In the second stage of the female\r\nof _Cœlostoma zælandicum_ this organ may be detected more easily than\r\nin any other Coccid; but the act of protrusion of the organ and the\r\nformation of the drop of honeydew are apparently by no means frequent,\r\nand many long observations may be made without witnessing either.[G]\r\n(The organ and the honeydew-drop are shown in Plate xxii.)\r\n\r\n[F] The fluid also emerges from the anal orifice; but, seemingly, no\r\nmention is made by any observer of any special honeydew-organ protruding\r\nfrom the anus of Aphis.\r\n\r\n[G] Mr. Comstock (\"Report on Insects,\" U.S. Dept. of Agric., 1881, p. 22)\r\nstates that on gently rubbing a _Dactylopius_ two small drops of fluid,\r\nwhich he considers to be honeydew, can be seen to emerge from orifices\r\non the dorsal side of the sixth abdominal segment; but he mentions no\r\nspecial organ in the body. The experiment has been tried on _Dactylopius_\r\nin this country without success.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this work further details as to the production\r\nof honeydew are not necessary. But as to its effect on plants it is\r\nrequisite to be more particular, and the attention of tree-growers\r\nand gardeners is specially directed to the following points. It has\r\nbeen said above that when the bubble of honeydew has been expanded to\r\nits full size it breaks into spray. Now, as a general rule, Coccids\r\nare found almost exclusively on the _under_ sides of leaves (when not\r\non the bark). Some, as _Lecanium hesperidum_ and a few others, may\r\nbe seen on the upper side; but the general rule is as here stated.\r\nIt follows that the spray of honeydew from the burst bubble falls,\r\nnot on the leaf where the insect is, but on the _upper_ sides of the\r\nleaves below it. These upper surfaces, being more exposed to light and\r\nair than the lower ones, are usually deserted not only by the Coccids\r\nbut by other insects also, and so there is not much chance that the\r\nhoneydew spray so falling will be disturbed. It consequently rapidly\r\naccumulates and forms a coating on the leaf where it rests. From this\r\nresult two things, or, rather, the same injurious effect on the plant\r\nis produced in two ways. First, the honeydew itself, being, as stated,\r\nof a glutinous nature, tends to stop up and choke the stomata (or, in\r\nplain English, the breathing-orifices of the leaves) and so retard\r\nthe growth of the tree. Secondly, the honeydew, being of a saccharine\r\nnature, is especially attractive to fungoid growths, and these fungi,\r\nrapidly increasing, tend still more to choke the leaves and hamper the\r\nproper functions of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe second of these is the most important, for, apparently, the\r\nhoneydew is scarcely deposited before it becomes the receptacle for\r\nfungus-spores, and these grow with great rapidity. As a general rule,\r\nin New Zealand, these fungi appear to be mostly of the same family--the\r\nPhysomycetes, and they are of a black or very dark brown colour. From\r\nthe fact above stated, that the honeydew falls from the insects upon\r\nleaves beneath them, the lower leaves of a plant are more covered\r\nwith it than the upper ones: these black fungi consequently discolour\r\nchiefly the lower leaves and branches; often the uppermost branches\r\nare nearly free from them. But the effect produced on the tree is not\r\nonly unsightly, from the sooty blackness, but also injurious, from the\r\nchoking-up of the stomata both by the honeydew and the fungus. As for\r\nornamental plants, whether under glass or in the open air, the black\r\ncoating is quite sufficient to spoil them.\r\n\r\nThese fungi are of various species, and specimens are given here in\r\nPlate xxii.: on the leaves they form usually a hard, thin, black coat;\r\nwhile on the twigs and stem they are of a looser texture, forming\r\nmasses of minute erect threads. They are not confined to New Zealand,\r\nand most writers on Coccididæ in Europe and elsewhere mention them,\r\nthough only casually. They are, in fact, apparently, only the usual\r\ngrowths appearing on any decomposing substance, such as the honeydew is.\r\n\r\nGardeners and tree-growers ought to clearly understand that the\r\nappearance on their plants of this black sooty covering is almost\r\nalways an indication of the presence of some Homopterous insects. In\r\nNew Zealand, on account of the greater prevalence of Coccididæ, the\r\ninsects will most probably be Coccids; but by no means necessarily\r\nso, for many Aphididæ, Psyllidæ, and Aleurodidæ produce the same\r\neffects. This is by no means as well understood as it should be,\r\neither by gardeners themselves or by those who write on trees and\r\nplanting. The fungus growth is usually imagined to be in itself a\r\ndisease of the plant, and efforts are made for its treatment without\r\nregard to its real origin, the insects on the leaves or bark. Under\r\nthe names of \"smut,\" \"black blight,\" &c., it is often referred to as\r\na destructive pest; and remedies are suggested which can, of course,\r\nhave no permanent effect unless they are equally efficacious against\r\nthe insect producing the honeydew. It is probably from this cause that\r\nsulphur, which is an excellent remedy against fungus, has been so\r\ngreat a favourite with those who pretend to have discovered what are\r\ncalled \"scaly-blight destroyers;\" and gardeners, seeing, perhaps, these\r\nnostrums clean some of the fungus from their trees, are under the false\r\nimpression that the \"scale\" is also cleared away. The truth is, that\r\nthe real remedy against \"black blight\" is to kill the insects on whose\r\nexcreta it flourishes, if that can be done. As to the modes of doing\r\nthis see Chapter V.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, pretended here that fungi of different kinds,\r\nand even those specially referred to, will not grow independently of\r\ninsects and honeydew; and trees are, undoubtedly, subject to fungoid\r\ndiseases which are not to be traced to any animal action. Still, the\r\nrule holds good; and the first effort of a gardener on the appearance\r\nof black blight on his plants should be to discover the insects on its\r\nleaves or bark, and deal directly with them. Once they are destroyed\r\nthe fungus growth will in a short time disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCHECKS TO INCREASE OF COCCIDIDÆ, PARASITES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coccididæ, like all Homoptera, produce great numbers of young; but\r\ntheir increase does not appear to be as rapid as that of some other\r\nfamilies. The numbers of some Aphididæ or Aleurodidæ produced from\r\na single female in the course of a single year have been calculated\r\nat hundreds of thousands, if not millions; and as many as eleven\r\ngenerations have been produced in little over half a year. Coccids,\r\nhowever, as a rule, do not propagate at this alarming rate. Many,\r\nif not the great majority of them, produce in this country but one\r\ngeneration in the year, e.g., _Mytilaspis pomorum_, _Cœlostoma\r\nzælandicum_, &c. Others, such as _Icerya purchasi_, breed more often;\r\nand probably climate has a good deal to do with the frequency, for\r\nMr. Comstock says that in the United States _Mytilaspis pomorum_\r\nbreeds once a year in the North and twice in the South. In point of\r\nfact, it does not seem possible to lay down any rule on the subject.\r\nUnfortunately, _Icerya_ is not only a frequent breeder, but also the\r\nmost destructive insect of the family in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe number of young produced by each female seems also to vary. The\r\nauthor has counted from 30 to 80 eggs in the puparium of _Mytilaspis\r\npomorum_; as many as 350 in the ovisac of _Icerya purchasi_, and about\r\nthe same number of _Cœlostoma zælandicum_: and a female of _Lecanium\r\nhesperidum_ examined in spring contained 93 embryos. These figures do\r\nnot denote any remarkable fertility; but, as in the majority of cases\r\nmales are but seldom met with, sometimes even entirely unknown (e.g.,\r\n_Lecanium hesperidum_), it follows that nearly every insect is capable\r\nof propagation, and the increase in numbers is therefore more rapid\r\nthan might be anticipated otherwise. How the females in the species\r\napparently destitute of males are enabled to produce young is perhaps\r\none of the most mysterious things in Nature. The male of _Mytilaspis\r\npomorum_ has never been found in New Zealand or Europe, and doubtfully\r\nin America. _Lecanium hesperidum_ has been known and studied for nearly\r\ntwo hundred years without any male, pupa or adult, being discovered.\r\nYet both of these species go on increasing regularly and in great\r\nnumbers, and show no signs of extinction.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this absence of males in some cases, and of the\r\ncomparatively small numbers of eggs, Coccids would naturally increase\r\nat an exceedingly rapid rate if left undisturbed, on account of the\r\ngreat proportion of females. They are, moreover, protected, to a great\r\nextent--First, by the fact that birds do not, as a rule, care to eat\r\nthem. The \"blight-bird\" or \"white-eye,\" _Zosterops lateralis_, has\r\nbeen noticed in this country pecking about in holly-hedges infested by\r\n_Lecanium hesperidum_; but it is not absolutely certain whether it was\r\neating the Coccids or the other more easily picked-off insects on the\r\nplant, such as _Psocus_, which is very commonly observed among Coccids.\r\nAnd other birds seem not to devour them at all. Secondly, the usual\r\nposition of these insects, on the under side of the leaves, or in the\r\ncrevices of bark, is a great shelter and protection for them against\r\nbirds or ordinary accidents. Again, they are in many cases effectually\r\ncovered by the waxy or fibrous shields, or by the masses of cotton with\r\nwhich they surround themselves. In countries like the South of France,\r\nCalifornia, or the greater part of New Zealand, the winters do not\r\nappear to be sufficiently severe to injure Coccids, and many of them\r\nbreed as much in winter as they do in summer. It would therefore seem\r\nthat everything combines to assist these insects in their career, and\r\nin their propagation. Nature, however, has provided a check which is\r\nto some extent effective, at least against several species, although,\r\nunhappily, against some of the most noxious--such as _Mytilaspis\r\npomorum_, the Dactylopii (mealy bugs), _Icerya purchasi_, &c.--it\r\nis not energetic in this country; and this remedy is the attacks of\r\nother minute animals, whether by direct devouring of the Coccids or by\r\nparasitism.\r\n\r\nDirect attacks from animal enemies are not frequent. Whether from some\r\ninherent distastefulness, or from the difficulty of getting at them,\r\nCoccids are scarcely subject to being directly devoured. There are a\r\nfew exceptions. Under the puparia of _Mytilaspis pomorum_ a minute\r\nwhite Acarus (mite) may often be found, and it is noticeable that\r\nwhere it abounds the eggs of the Coccid are often shrivelled or empty.\r\nIt is not improbable that this Acarus may feed on the eggs. It appears\r\nto belong to the genus _Tyroglyphus_, a mite which is not usually\r\ncarnivorous; but Mr. A. Michael, an authority on mites, seems to be\r\nuncertain whether _Tyroglyphus_ may not make a meal of the Coccid.[H]\r\nNo others amongst the Diaspidinæ appear to be directly attacked, nor\r\nany of the Lecanidinæ; but amongst a number of _Dactylopius glaucus_\r\non a leaf there may often be seen a minute caterpillar, apparently\r\ncovered with many tufts of hair. This is the larva of the common\r\nladybird (_Coccinella_), a beetle which, in both the larval and perfect\r\nstates, feeds on Aphides, Coccids, and other insects. The larva may\r\nsometimes be seen holding a _Dactylopius_ in its powerful jaws and\r\ndevouring it. Another larva, smooth and without hairs, performs the\r\nsame functions--it is the young of a small dipterous fly, apparently\r\none of the _Syrphidæ_, insects also predatory; but this seems to be\r\nrare. In America, similar larvæ are said to feed upon the \"black scale\"\r\n(_Lecanium oleæ_). In this country, as far as is yet known, Lecanidæ\r\nare not directly attacked by the ladybirds.\r\n\r\n[H] Quart. Journ. Royal Micros. Soc., Feb., 1885.\r\n\r\nBut this direct warfare by other animals is of small consequence. A\r\nmore important check on the increase of many Coccids is afforded by\r\nthe indirect action of minute hymenopterous insects, which make use of\r\nthem as receptacles for their eggs. This plan is adopted by several\r\nHymenoptera, of the families Chalcididæ, Ichneumonidæ, Proctotrupidæ,\r\n&c. They do not devour their prey; they allow it to live that they may\r\nlive on it. By means of their long ovipositor they pierce its body, and\r\ndeposit in it an egg. As the victim grows the egg matures, changes into\r\na larva, and still remains in the body of the Coccid; changes again\r\ninto a pupa, and by this time the Coccid is at liberty to die, for the\r\nparasite has no further use for it except as a shelter; then, when the\r\nproper time arrives, the perfect fly emerges and departs. All Coccids\r\nare by no means equally subject to this system. In the United States,\r\naccording to Mr. L. O. Howard,[I] parasites are found in nearly all\r\ngenera--Diaspidinæ, Lecanidinæ, or Coccidinæ. In this country, as far\r\nas observation shows at present, the Lecanidinæ are the most liable\r\nto attack, some of the Diaspidinæ next, and the Coccidinæ least of\r\nall. _Mytilaspis pomorum_, so hurtful to apple-trees, does not seem\r\nto be attacked. _Icerya purchasi_, the worst species of all, has not\r\nyet furnished a single parasitic fly. A few specimens of _Dactylopius\r\nglaucus_ contain parasites; a good many of _Fiorinia asteliæ_ and _F.\r\nstricta_; while _Ctenochiton perforatus_ and _C. viridis_ appear to\r\nbe the favourite victims, as sometimes scarcely any specimens on a\r\nplant can be examined which do not contain either a larva or a pupa\r\nof a parasite. It is to be observed that in no case is more than one\r\nparasite to be found in a Coccid.\r\n\r\n[I] Report of the Entomologist, U.S. Dep. of Agric., 1880, pp. 350-371.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, although this provision of Nature must have a very\r\nconsiderable effect in preventing the increase of Coccididæ, it is\r\nsubject to two drawbacks. In the first place, as just observed, some of\r\nthe most injurious pests appear to be unaffected by it. Probably, up to\r\nthe present time the worst plant-enemies[J] in New Zealand have been\r\n_Mytilaspis pomorum_, _Aspidiotus coccineus_, _Aspidiotus camelliæ_,\r\n_Lecanium hesperidum_, _Lecanium oleæ_, _Lecanium hemisphæricum_,\r\n_Pulvinaria camellicola_, and _Icerya purchasi_. Here reference is made\r\nnot so much to insects which render plants unsightly as to those which\r\nseriously injure its growth: many others, such as _Fiorinia asteliæ_ or\r\n_Ctenochiton viridis_ are ugly enough, but have not been destructive.\r\nOf the injurious species above named none, apparently, are troubled in\r\nthis country by parasitic insects up to the present time, at least to\r\nany appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n[J] Speaking of Coccids only; _Kermaphis pini_ is equally, if not more,\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nA sketch of Ctenochiton enclosing a parasitic pupa, and of the perfect\r\nfly, will be found in Plate xxiii. In a work like this the generic and\r\nspecific characters of these parasites need not be given: they do not\r\nseem to differ much from hymenopterous and dipterous insects of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAnother mode by which the too rapid increase of Coccids is checked is\r\nby the attacks of vegetable parasites--fungoid growths which permeate\r\nthe whole body of the insect, and soon kill it. As far as experience in\r\nNew Zealand extends as yet the genera _Ctenochiton_, _Lecanium_, and\r\nprobably _Eriochiton_ are the only ones so attacked. On certain plants\r\nin the forests, notably Hedycarya and Coprosma, circular spots may\r\nbe commonly found on the under side of the leaves: some dark-brown,\r\nsomewhat convex, some bright yellow and often quite globular. In\r\nspring, examination of a young larva of _Ctenochiton viridis_--a\r\nspecies very common on the above plants--will frequently show, either\r\nwithin the insect, or on its waxy test, or between the test and the\r\ninsect, minute specks, which under a high power of the microscope,\r\nprove to resemble the filaments composing the brown or the yellow spots\r\njust mentioned. On turning over one of the brown fungi, or on pulling\r\nit to pieces, the dead body of a young _Ctenochiton_ or _Lecanium_\r\nlarva will always be found in the middle. Apparently this brown fungus\r\ndoes not attack any but young larvæ; but the bright yellow fungus will\r\nbe found filling the bodies also of the females in the second stage,\r\nand the globular portion of the fungus will stand out above them.\r\nThese fungi are not of the same genus as _Empusa_, the fungus which so\r\nfrequently kills the house-fly; but they seem to act in much the same\r\nway within the insect.\r\n\r\nProbably a good many of the _Lecanodiaspidæ_ are preyed on and\r\ndestroyed by these fungoid parasites, of which figures are given in\r\nPlate xxiii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES AGAINST COCCIDIDÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people are under the impression that scale-insects out-of-doors\r\nare not of much consequence. They are aware that in greenhouses and\r\nhothouses these insects are a trouble to gardeners, and that they\r\nprobably injure flowering or fruit-bearing plants in such situations.\r\nBut they imagine that in the open air, and on large well-grown trees,\r\nCoccids do no very great harm; or, if the trees are for a time injured,\r\nthat recovery and health will come before long, and the pest will\r\ndisappear. This is not the place in which to controvert this or any\r\nother opinion. A work professedly dealing with facts should be as free\r\nas possible from controversial discussion. Whatever, therefore, may be\r\nthe grounds of the opinion just stated, or the reasons for rejecting\r\nit, it will be sufficient here to say that there seems to be nothing\r\nto lead to the belief that New Zealand is likely to be different\r\nfrom other countries in this respect. To institute a comparison, it\r\nwould be manifestly absurd to include such countries as England, or\r\nGermany, or, on the other hand, India, or Central America, or North\r\nAustralia--Firstly, because in the greater part, or at least in the\r\nnorthern parts, of Europe the winters are much more severe than in\r\nNew Zealand, and almost certainly the great cold is injurious to\r\nsuch insects as Coccids. Secondly, because in tropical countries it\r\nseems that the too great heat is equally obnoxious to them; and, with\r\nthe exception of a few species, tropical Coccids are comparatively\r\nharmless. But it is to the warmer temperate or the subtropical regions\r\nthat we must look for comparison--regions where there is neither too\r\nscorching a summer nor too ice-bound a winter. And, for this purpose,\r\nwe have only to take such lands as California, Florida, the South of\r\nFrance or Northern Italy, the Cape of Good Hope, the southern regions\r\nof Australia, &c. The experience of these is, that some species of\r\nCoccids do injure, in every way, whether as regards ornamental or\r\ncommercial value, a number of trees and plants on which the people of\r\nthe country depend largely for subsistence or profit. In the South of\r\nFrance the olive industry has been in some years greatly cut down. In\r\nFlorida, California, Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, oranges and\r\napples have been so damaged that the value of an orchard or a grove\r\nhas been reduced sometimes by 80 per cent. It may be said, moreover,\r\nthat even in tropical countries the attacks of scale-insects are\r\noften most damaging: in Mauritius the sugar-cane and in Ceylon the\r\ncoffee plantations have suffered from their ravages. The experience\r\nof American fruit-growers is certainly not to be despised, and the\r\nfact that both in California and Florida the people strain every\r\nnerve to get rid of the insect pests on open-air trees would seem to\r\nbe distinctly against the notion that these little enemies can be\r\nneglected with impunity.\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, can it be said that in New Zealand itself the attacks of\r\nscale-insects out-of-doors are harmless. Apple orchards throughout the\r\ncountry bear evidence to the contrary: lemon-groves can be seen about\r\nAuckland where, instead of the thousands of fruit formerly grown, a few\r\nstunted lemons are all that the withered trees afford; and nobody can\r\nglance round the plantations at Nelson or Napier without recognizing\r\nthe devastating powers of a scale-insect (_Icerya_).\r\n\r\nThe opinion that Coccids are not likely to do much harm in the open air\r\nis therefore scarcely tenable, and it will be of use to inquire what\r\nremedies can be provided against them.\r\n\r\nThere is a point, however, to be noted at the outset, and it is, that\r\nin reality there is not, as far as is yet known, any _certain_ remedy\r\nagainst scale-insects. Not that ingenuity and experiment have not\r\nsucceeded in inventing plans and substances quite efficient in killing\r\nthe insects when applied to them. It is easy enough to kill an insect\r\nwhen you can get at it, in most cases; but the problem in this instance\r\nis not only to kill individual insects, but to do more. What is wanted\r\nis to get rid of whole communities of them, and, at the same time, to\r\nprevent their eggs from hatching and a new brood coming forth. Many of\r\nthose who profess to know all about destroying \"scale\"--especially if\r\nthey belong to that class which prides itself upon being \"practical\r\nmen\"--being generally quite ignorant of the habits and life-history of\r\nthe insects, are satisfied when they have tried some rule-of-thumb\r\nplan which seems to kill most of the adult insects, not dreaming that\r\nthey have left the eggs unharmed and ready to send forth a fresh swarm\r\nat hatching-time. There is another obstacle which often prevents\r\nsuccess in eradicating \"scale.\" This is the difficulty of making sure\r\nof the effects of any remedy. A plan which has answered well in one\r\nplace will fail in another, and this, not only as regards different\r\ncountries, but even in the same district for neighbouring gardens,\r\nor even for neighbouring trees in the same garden. Tree-growers must\r\nbe prepared to find the very same remedy which has cleared their\r\nneighbours' trees fail for their own; and in this country the author\r\nhas seen, in one and the same orchard, some trees quite cleared,\r\nwhile on others, treated in exactly a similar manner, the \"scale\" was\r\nscarcely injured.\r\n\r\nIt is from want of knowledge of this and the like points that persons\r\nwho have tried various remedies recommended to them have complained of\r\nfailure, and condemned both the remedy and their adviser, whilst really\r\nneither was in fault.\r\n\r\nNothing need be said here of carelessness or unskilfulness in applying\r\na remedy, beyond the following instance: A person whose apple-trees\r\nwere being very much damaged by _Mytilaspis pomorum_ was advised\r\nto apply, by way of painting the trunks and branches, a mixture of\r\nkerosene and some other ingredient. In two or three months he found\r\nviolent fault with his adviser, for he said every tree was dead\r\nor dying. On inquiry it was found that, from over-zeal or want of\r\nknowledge, he had applied the mixture as if painting a house, had used\r\nit much too strong, and, to make assurance doubly sure, had given his\r\ntrees two good coats of the oil.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent appreciation of the life-history and habits of\r\nscale-insects is necessary to enable any one to select and apply, with\r\na probability of success, a remedy, and the details given in Chapter I.\r\nof this work will be found useful for this purpose. It will be apparent\r\nfrom them that, without regarding the generic or specific characters of\r\nthese insects, we may lay down a few general principles to start with,\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\nI. _Whatever damage is done is effected by the sucking of the juices of\r\nthe plant through the rostrum of the insect._ It follows from this that\r\napplications of any fluid to the tree externally, with the object of\r\npoisoning the insects in their feeding, would be useless, as their food\r\nis drawn from beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nII. Neglecting entomological distinctions, we may divide the Coccididæ,\r\nroughly, into--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Insects attacking deciduous plants;\r\n  (_b._) Insects attacking evergreen plants;\r\n           or, again,\r\n  (_c._) Insects living usually on the bark;\r\n  (_d._) Insects living usually on the leaves;\r\n  (_e._) Insects living on both bark and leaves;\r\n           or, lastly,\r\n  (_f._) Insects covered with hard shields or \"scales;\"\r\n  (_g._) Insects covered with cotton;\r\n  (_h._) Insects naked.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that a different method will be required for\r\ndestroying these different classes; but any one insect will belong\r\nto more than one class. Thus _Mytilaspis pomorum_, the apple-scale,\r\nbelongs to (_a_), (_c_), and (_f_), and indeed may be placed also\r\nin (_b_), as such plants as hawthorns, which it attacks, are as bad\r\nas evergreens in the difficulty of reaching the insect on them; or,\r\n_Lecanium hesperidum_ is in (_a_), (_d_), and (_h_); Lecanium oleæ in\r\n(_a_), (_b_), (_e_), and (_h_).\r\n\r\nAs far as regards the injurious species of Coccids it may usually be\r\ntaken for granted that those infesting deciduous plants (class _a_)\r\nlive chiefly on the bark (class _c_), and are either naked (class _h_)\r\nor covered with a hard scale (class _f_). If naked they are chiefly\r\n_Lecanium_; if covered, either _Mytilaspis_, _Aspidiotus_ or _Diaspis_.\r\n\r\n_Icerya_ is exceptional, being omnivorous, feeding equally on bark or\r\nleaves, deciduous or evergreen plants; it belongs to every class except\r\n(_f_). Every method of destruction has therefore to be resorted to\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of a deciduous plant infested by Coccids is simple as\r\nto its method. For two reasons the dead winter-time must be chosen\r\nfor it--first, because, the leaves being off, the whole plant can be\r\neasily got at; secondly, because the eggs of the insect have not yet\r\nbeen hatched, and the whole brood can be destroyed at once. The first\r\noperation should be the pruning of the tree, so as to reduce the labour\r\nrequired to a minimum. A brushing over all the trunk and branches with\r\na good hard stiff brush and one of the liquid remedies given below is\r\nthen often successful. Brushing with a _dry_ brush is adopted by some\r\npersons; but, although this doubtless clears away a good many insects\r\nand scales, and may do the tree itself some good by cleaning off\r\nfungus-growths and incrustations, yet it necessarily fails to destroy\r\nall the eggs, and in consequence the work is only half done. _Any one\r\nwho wishes to extirpate Coccids must make certain that he has destroyed\r\nthe eggs_--a fact which is quite ignored by numbers of those who glibly\r\ntalk of their own success, and blame the advice of others. The object\r\nbeing, therefore, twofold, the operation should be performed with a\r\nhard, stiff brush dipped in one of the fluids recommended below; and\r\ncare should be taken that there is no part of the trunk or branches\r\nescaping untouched. In fact, what should be aimed at is a kind of\r\npainting of the tree, but with a thin coating of the fluid, so as to\r\nclose the pores as little as may be; while at the same time the brush\r\nclears away as many as possible of the \"scales\" and their enclosed\r\nbroods of insects and eggs.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind what has been said just now of the want of _certainty_\r\nin any remedy whatsoever, the tree-grower who follows these directions\r\nwill most likely find his work successful and his deciduous plants\r\ncleaned of \"scale\" on the bark.\r\n\r\nA second method may be adopted--namely, the painting-over of the trunk\r\nand branches, without attempting to forcibly detach any \"scales\" with\r\nthe brush. This, _properly performed and with proper fluids_, is\r\nlikely to be just as efficacious as the other, for the fluid should\r\n\"run in\" under the scales, surround the eggs, and prevent them from\r\nhatching. It gives less trouble than the hard brushing, and is equally\r\ndestructive to the Coccids. It has, however, of course, not the same\r\ncleaning effect upon fungoid growths or incrustations impeding the free\r\n\"respiration\" of the plant.\r\n\r\nFor deciduous trees, then, such as apple- or pear-trees in an orchard,\r\nthe simple remedy is severe pruning at the dead of winter, and the\r\ncoating of the trees with a destructive fluid, laid on with a brush _on\r\nevery part_, preferably with a hard brush vigorously used, but leaving\r\na thin coat of the fluid on the bark.\r\n\r\n_It must be thoroughly understood that, a week or two after the first\r\napplication, the \"scales\" left on the tree should be examined, and,\r\nif the eggs are not killed, a second coating of the fluid should be\r\napplied._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of evergreen plants, or of plants which are attacked both\r\non the bark and leaves, is really the same as the above as regards its\r\nobject, but it necessarily differs in its method. Here, again, it is\r\ndesired not only to kill the insects themselves, but also to devitalize\r\nthe eggs; but in this case the work is much harder, for the eggs are\r\nespecially difficult to reach. Still, there is this advantage: that in\r\ndealing with evergreens the season of the year need not be specially\r\nstudied, and, in default of touching the eggs, one may get at the young\r\nlarvæ. The remedy is again a fluid, but it must be applied in the form\r\nof spray. Coccids are sometimes found on the upper surfaces of leaves,\r\nbut as a rule they affect the lower sides. This, of course, renders\r\nit much more difficult to get at them; and the ordinary rose of a\r\ngarden syringe would not, as a general thing, distribute the fluid in a\r\nsufficiently-fine form. The finer the spray and the more it is forced\r\ninto every corner and nook of the plant the better. Various force-pumps\r\nand spray-throwers have been invented for this purpose in the United\r\nStates; but probably tree-growers in this country need only procure the\r\nfinest possible rose for their syringes, and use them in the ordinary\r\nway. The fluid should be thrown as thoroughly as possible on all parts\r\nof the plant, every care being taken to direct it most fully against\r\nthe under sides of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe work, then, to be done is in itself simple enough. A destructive\r\nfluid must be selected and applied according to the character of the\r\ninsect and its position on the tree. For covered or naked insects on\r\nthe bark, apply it with a hard, stiff brush; for covered or naked\r\ninsects on the leaves, apply it in the form of the _finest spray_\r\nthoroughly forced as much as possible into every nook and cranny, and\r\nespecially against the under side of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe question, \"What is the best fluid to use?\" is more complicated.\r\nMany answers have been given to it: many fluids have been strongly\r\nrecommended by different people. It must be well remembered that, as\r\nstated above, a sure and sovereign remedy has yet to be discovered, and\r\nfailure may attend even the best suggested at present. Bearing this\r\nin mind, tree-growers will find in the following list the result of\r\nthe experience of a number of observers, which may serve as a useful\r\nguide. It does not profess to be more than a summary, compiled from the\r\nresearches of entomologists such as Mr. Comstock, Professor Riley, Mr.\r\nHubbard; from suggestions by gardeners and others, embodied in various\r\nparliamentary and private documents; and from actual observation and\r\nexperiment in this country: but it is believed that the information\r\nhere given may be accepted and relied on.\r\n\r\nSome of the substances here given are manifestly unsuitable for general\r\nuse on account of their expense, at any rate in the open air. Yet it is\r\nwell to include them, as they are all suggested in some work or other,\r\nor in the replies of gardeners and fruit-growers to parliamentary\r\ninquiries; and the objections to them ought also to be known:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Alcohol._ Will certainly kill any individual insect; but\r\n       \"sprayed over scale-insects produced no apparent effect\"\r\n       (Comstock).\r\n\r\n  2. _Ammonia._ Whether used pure (diluted) or in urine, damages the\r\n       plants much more than it does the insects (Hubbard; Comstock).\r\n\r\n  3. _Ashes._ Powdered, or mixed with lime, salt, soot, &c. Of no\r\n       value whatever (Hubbard; Personal experiment).\r\n\r\n  4. _Carbolic acid._ Of no avail, either as spray or brushed on,\r\n       unless used in such strength as to seriously damage the tree\r\n       (Hubbard; Riley; Comstock).\r\n\r\n  5. _Castor-oil._ Has been found efficacious in cleaning\r\n       hawthorn-trees at the Agricultural College, Lincoln (T. Kirk).\r\n       It was mixed with soot for some unexplained reason. The time of\r\n       the year when it was applied is not stated; but the author's\r\n       experiments seem to show that castor-oil _does not effectually\r\n       kill the eggs_. Still, it is doubtless a valuable remedy if\r\n       applied repeatedly, so as to kill larvæ and adults, supposing it\r\n       to be sufficiently cheap.\r\n\r\n  6. _Cole's Insect-exterminator._ Apparently a mixture of about 2\r\n       parts of \"green soap\" with 100 parts of strong alcohol. It is\r\n       \"effectual as an insecticide, and harmless to growing plants;\"\r\n       but \"the cost is too great, except on a small scale, as in\r\n       conservatories\" (Comstock).\r\n\r\n  7. _Gasoline._ Seems to have been used in California on pear-trees:\r\n       result, doubtful (New Zealand Parliamentary Papers: Codlin Moth\r\n       Committee Report, 1885, page 8).\r\n\r\n  8. _Gishurst compound._ Very favourably spoken of in many quarters.\r\n       In New South Wales it has been found efficacious on orange-trees\r\n       against _Aspidiotus coccineus_ (Alderton); in Nelson it is said\r\n       to be used beneficially against _Icerya purchasi_. _It does not,\r\n       however, kill the eggs with certainty_ (Personal experiment).\r\n       Applied warm, and properly diluted, it may be recommended as a\r\n       good remedy; but applications of it should be repeated.\r\n\r\n  9. _Kerosene._ Seemingly the most valuable of all remedies, when\r\n       properly applied. \"Almost the only substance which will\r\n       certainly kill the eggs without at the same time destroying the\r\n       plant\" (Hubbard).\r\n\r\n       But the application of this remedy must be carefully performed.\r\n       Some trees may endure it without injury, even undiluted or\r\n       unmixed; but this is scarcely to be expected, and the oil should\r\n       therefore be applied in some mixed form. Also, it is important\r\n       to remember _that a hot sun increases the injurious effect of\r\n       kerosene_; consequently winter, or cloudy weather, should be\r\n       chosen for its employment.\r\n\r\n       (_a._) _Pure kerosene._ As just stated, it is probably not\r\n       advisable to use this. Still, \"a young shoot of orange, not\r\n       more than fourteen days old, was uninjured by an application of\r\n       pure kerosene which thoroughly wet every leaf;\" (Comstock); and\r\n       _Lecanium hesperidum_ on ivy, similarly treated, was destroyed,\r\n       without injury to the plant (ibid.).\r\n\r\n       (_b._) _Kerosene and milk._ An excellent mixture, if milk can be\r\n       obtained cheap (Riley; Hubbard; Comstock). It must be applied\r\n       in the form of an \"emulsion,\" sprayed over the tree or brushed\r\n       on the bark. Hubbard gives the following directions for use:\r\n       Heat the milk nearly to boiling-point and mix with double the\r\n       quantity of kerosene; churn violently from ten minutes to half\r\n       an hour, according to temperature, until a creamy thick fluid\r\n       is obtained; dilute this with nine or ten times the quantity\r\n       of water. The mixture is of course purely a _mechanical_ one,\r\n       as far at least as the water is concerned, and it must be kept\r\n       constantly stirred, to prevent the substances from separating\r\n       from the water. For evergreen trees impel the mixture on leaves\r\n       and branches _in the finest possible spray_. Sour milk is as\r\n       useful as fresh.\r\n\r\n       The object of the milk is not only to lessen the injurious\r\n       qualities of the kerosene, but also to induce it to mix more\r\n       freely with the water; but it is the oil alone which destroys\r\n       the insects _and their eggs_.\r\n\r\n       (_c._) _Kerosene and soap._ When milk is not obtainable, or too\r\n       dear, nothing is so excellent as this mixture. Soap itself (see\r\n       below) is a useful insecticide, and in combination with kerosene\r\n       includes the good qualities of both substances. The cheapest\r\n       possible qualities of soap will do. The mixture, which is, even\r\n       more than the last, purely _mechanical_, must be made first\r\n       of all an \"emulsion.\" The American experiments result in the\r\n       following recipe and method of using:--\r\n\r\n       Formula:\r\n\r\n              Common soap        1/2lb.\r\n              Kerosene           2 galls.\r\n              _Soft_ water       1 gall.\r\n\r\n       Dissolve the soap in the water heated to boiling, then add the\r\n       kerosene, and churn the mixture until a creamy fluid results\r\n       which thickens on cooling. Dilute with nine or ten times the\r\n       quantity of water: the quantities given above will make about\r\n       thirty gallons of liquid. Whale-oil soap, soft-soap, or any\r\n       other kind will do. As with the milk emulsion, apply in the form\r\n       of the finest spray for evergreens (Riley; Hubbard; Personal\r\n       experiment).\r\n\r\n       (_d._) _Kerosene and oil._ Castor-oil, linseed-oil, whale-oil,\r\n       may be used. A mixture of this kind, in the proportion of 1 part\r\n       kerosene to 3 or 4 of oil, has been found very efficacious for\r\n       apple- and other fruit-trees attacked by the common apple-scale\r\n       (_Myt. pomorum_). But, as observed above, the mixture must\r\n       not be laid on too thick. Thinly brushed all over trunk and\r\n       branches, at dead of winter, it has been found quite successful\r\n       in destroying both insects _and eggs_, without injury to the\r\n       trees (Personal experiment). It would probably not answer for\r\n       evergreens, on account of expense.\r\n\r\n       On the whole, it may be said that, as far as certainty can\r\n       be attained in the matter, there is no substance better for\r\n       destroying Coccids _and their eggs_ than kerosene in the form\r\n       of milk or soap emulsion, diluted with water for evergreens or\r\n       for trees with insects on the leaves as well as on the bark.\r\n       Probably, for deciduous fruit-trees the kerosene-and-oil mixture\r\n       is the best.\r\n\r\n       The great point in favour of this substance is that _it destroys\r\n       the eggs_; this, few if any of the others will accomplish.\r\n\r\n  10. _Lime._ Of no avail whatever.\r\n\r\n  11. _Lye._ Concentrated lye is very frequently recommended. In the\r\n       New Zealand Parliamentary Papers (Codlin Moth Committee Report,\r\n       1885, page 7) several statements will be found apparently most\r\n       favourable to it; yet in places we find admissions that \"it\r\n       cannot reach all the eggs.\" In America generally, it has not\r\n       been found satisfactory: \"inferior to kerosene in killing-power,\r\n       and far more injurious to trees when used in solutions strong\r\n       enough to be effective as insecticides.\"\r\n\r\n  It is quite possible that the action of lye on the fungus\r\n       accompanying the scale-insects (see Chap. III.) may have led\r\n       \"practical\" gardeners to imagine that it cleaned their trees of\r\n       scale. Comstock says, \"I saw most excellent results from the\r\n       following mixture: 1lb. concentrated lye, one pint gasoline or\r\n       benzine, half pint oil, five gallons water.\" Probably the good\r\n       results here were due, not to the lye, but to the gasoline and\r\n       oil.\r\n\r\n  12. _Pyrethrum._ Useless against Coccids (Comstock).\r\n\r\n  13. _Salt._ Useless (Comstock).\r\n\r\n  14. _Soap._ Undoubtedly a valuable remedy, and perhaps, in some\r\n       cases, as efficient as kerosene; _but it does not destroy the\r\n       eggs_. A solution of 3/4lb. of soap to a gallon of water,\r\n       _applied hot_, was entirely successful in California: three\r\n       months after its application no living scale-insect could be\r\n       found (Comstock). The time of the year is not stated. In another\r\n       case the solution was applied cold: \"four days after no living\r\n       insect could be found;\" but, again, the time of the year is not\r\n       stated, and no mention is made of the eggs. Still, a strong\r\n       solution of soap may be said to be one of the best remedies\r\n       against the larvæ and adult insects--proportions from 1/4lb. to\r\n       1/3lb. soap to one gallon of water (Comstock; Hubbard; Personal\r\n       experiment).\r\n\r\n  15. _Soda, caustic._ Strongly recommended by many persons. It\r\n       injures the tree, _and does not kill the eggs_--two things which\r\n       are decidedly against its use. Gardeners may have been led to\r\n       employ it from finding that in some instances it clears away the\r\n       black fungus-growths (Chap. III.), and imagining this to be a\r\n       clearance also of the scales.\r\n\r\n  16. _Soda, silicate._ Kills some insects, _but no eggs_, and injures\r\n       the tree (Hubbard).\r\n\r\n  17. _Sulphate of iron._ \"A common ingredient in patent remedies;\"\r\n       most injurious to vegetation. It does not affect scale-insects\r\n       (Hubbard).\r\n\r\n  18. _Sulphur._ Another substance, the object of a kind of\r\n       superstitious veneration amongst gardeners. It is excellent\r\n       against fungoid growth, but of little value against\r\n       scale-insects. Here, again, the clearing of the black fungus has\r\n       probably been taken to mean also the destruction of the insects\r\n       (Hubbard; Comstock; Personal experiment). Comstock says that in\r\n       America people often bore holes in their trees and stuff them\r\n       with sulphur, under the notion that the substance will be taken\r\n       up by the sap, and poison the insects: quite a futile idea.\r\n\r\n  19. _Sulphur and lime._ A dangerous compound, and useless unless\r\n       applied in such strength as to kill the tree. Its fumes are\r\n       poisonous, and it may seriously injure the face and hands\r\n       (Hubbard).\r\n\r\n  20. _Sulphur and snuff._ Equal parts mixed and dusted over _Lecanium\r\n       hesperidum_ on a wet day were quite successful (Comstock). But\r\n       the mixture would be too expensive except for conservatory\r\n       plants, and doubtless the snuff alone would be quite as\r\n       efficacious.\r\n\r\n  21. _Sulphuric acid._ \"Killed nearly all the scale-insects, and very\r\n       nearly killed the tree\" (Hubbard). No mention is made of its\r\n       action on the eggs.\r\n\r\n  22. _Soot._ Useless (Hubbard; Comstock; Personal experiment).\r\n\r\n  23. _Tobacco._ A good remedy against larvæ and adults; _doubtful\r\n       against the eggs_. Fumigation has no effect on scale-insects,\r\n       except sometimes on Dactylopidæ, or \"mealy bugs\" (Hubbard;\r\n       Comstock; Personal experiment). The tobacco should be applied in\r\n       a pretty strong solution; but the expense in this country would\r\n       be probably too great for general use.\r\n\r\n  24. _Whale-oil and whale-oil soap_ have been already alluded to\r\n       under the head \"Kerosene.\" They are both useful ingredients in\r\n       mixture with that substance, if procurable cheaply.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing list it will be gathered that, if experiment,\r\ncombined with knowledge of the habits and life-history of\r\nscale-insects, can be relied on, there is no substance better adapted\r\nfor their destruction than kerosene, mixed with oil, or milk, or\r\nsoap solution, and _carefully applied_. It has been already observed\r\nthat the killing of the eggs is absolutely necessary for thorough\r\nclearing-away of the insects; and, to quote again the words of Mr.\r\nHubbard, kerosene is \"almost the only substance which will with\r\ncertainty kill the eggs without at the same time destroying the plant.\"\r\n\r\nBut precautions must not be neglected. Persons who recklessly use any\r\nremedy, or who apply it too thickly or in too strong proportions, must\r\nexpect their trees to suffer. Nor must the weather and the time of\r\nthe year be overlooked. _Winter is the best season for all remedies_;\r\nand, preferably, cool and cloudy days. Again, if substances soluble in\r\nwater, such as potash or soda lye, soap solutions, &c., be employed, it\r\nmust be expected that a day's rain will wash a good deal of them off,\r\nand greatly reduce their efficacy. These are things which many people\r\nforget; they fancy that because somebody has cleared his trees with,\r\nsay, castor-oil in winter they can do the same thing in full heat of\r\nsummer; or, because a lye solution has done well in the dry climate of\r\nCalifornia, that it will be equally good in the rains of New Zealand.\r\nStill more is it a fallacy to imagine that rule-of-thumb methods, not\r\nfounded upon any knowledge of the nature, habits, and life-history of\r\nthe insects, are likely to be really efficacious.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said here of a remedy which has had, to some extent, the\r\nauthority of Professor Riley, and which is recommended by Mr. Howard\r\n(Report U.S. Dep. of Agric. 1880-81, p. 351): viz., the transportation\r\nor acclimatization of parasites on scale-insects. Doubtless the thing\r\ncould be done, as experiments in America have shown. But there are\r\nplenty of parasitic insects in New Zealand already, and, although they\r\nseem to have hitherto confined their work to the native and mostly to\r\nthe innoxious Coccids, they may at any time begin to attack the others,\r\nand it is only a question of time when they will act usefully as\r\nefficient checks (see Chap. IV.).\r\n\r\nThere is one Coccid of which it must be said that, whilst kerosene\r\nmixtures will undoubtedly destroy it, by far the best remedy of all is\r\nto destroy and burn at once the infested trees. _Icerya purchasi_ is so\r\nvoracious and universal a feeder, so repulsive in its aspect, and so\r\ndestructive in its effects that the most drastic remedy is the best.\r\nAny one, therefore, having a tree, especially an ornamental or a fruit\r\ntree, attacked by _Icerya purchasi_, is strongly recommended to make\r\nno delay, but to cut down and burn every stick of the tree as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt was observed at the beginning of this chapter that some people hold\r\nthe opinion that the damage done by scale-insects is not of importance.\r\nThe foregoing remarks upon remedies are not directed to those who hold\r\nthis view, which is contradicted by the experience not only of other\r\ncountries but of New Zealand itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authorities referred to in this Chapter._\r\n\r\n U.S. Department of Agriculture--\r\n\r\n Reports by Professor Riley, Professor Comstock, Mr. Hubbard, Mr. L.

Four groups of\r\nspinnerets, upper pair with fifteen orifices; lower pair, nine or ten.\r\nAbdomen terminating in several lobes, of which the four median are the\r\nlargest; between the lobes scaly serrated hairs.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Atherosperma Novæ Zælandiæ_, Wellington; Hawke's Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n  2. Aspidiotus Budlæiæ, Signoret.\r\n      Ann. de la Soc. Entom. de France, 1868, p. 115.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 198.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium circular, flat, dirty-white, about 1/15in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nMale puparium oval, dirty-white, about 1/30in. in length.\r\n\r\nAdult female light-yellow, peg-top shaped; abdomen ending in two\r\nsomewhat prominent lobes, with scaly hairs and spines. Four groups of\r\nspinnerets: upper groups with five or six orifices; lower groups, three\r\nor four.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellow, slightly brown on the thorax; antennæ of ten joints,\r\nall hairy.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On silver-wattle, Nelson. The insect is European, and found\r\nthere on _Budlæia salicina_.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to _A. nerii_, but differing in the lobes and spinnerets\r\nof the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. Aspidiotus Camelliæ, Boisduval.\r\n      _Kermes camelliæ_, Boisduval, Ent. Hort., p. 334.\r\n      _Aspidiotus camelliæ_, Signoret, loc. cit., 1869, p. 117.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 200; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 21.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium nearly circular, convex, greyish or brownish in colour,\r\nabout 1/15in. in diameter; pellicles often at one side.\r\n\r\nMale puparium rather smaller, oval.\r\n\r\nAdult female of normal shape, but somewhat elongated. Abdomen ending in\r\ntwo lobes, with a few scattered scaly hairs. No groups of spinnerets.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On camellias, Christchurch; on euonymus, weeping willow, &c.,\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nVery common in gardens about Wellington: sometimes does much damage to\r\neuonymus shrubs and hedges.\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. Aspidiotus Carpodeti, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 21.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium usually light-brown, but varying a little with the\r\ncolour of the bark of the tree; convex; circular; the pellicles in the\r\ncentre; some specimens are slightly elongated. Average diameter, 1/16in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium narrow, with parallel sides; not carinated; dirty-white\r\nor brownish colour; length, about 1/16in.\r\n\r\nAdult female of the normal peg-top shape, the abdomen not so much\r\noverlapped as usual. Abdomen ending in two median somewhat prominent\r\nlobes, with two others much smaller not in close proximity; edge of\r\nthe body jagged, with curvilinear incisions, amongst which and between\r\nthe lobes are a number of serrated pointed hairs, as in _A. nerii_.\r\nFour groups of spinnerets: lower pair with four to six orifices; upper,\r\nwith six to ten. These groups seem surrounded by a narrow line as if\r\nenclosed in a chamber: the same appearance is presented (according\r\nto a figure of Mr. Comstock's) in _A. nerii_. There are many single\r\nspinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male of normal form, with antennæ of ten joints, of which the\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth are the longest. The haltere has a somewhat\r\nlong peduncle. The abdominal spike is rather long, and springs from a\r\nlarge tubercle.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Carpodetus serratus_ and _Vitex littoralis_ (puriri),\r\nWellington. The puparia are so like in colour to the bark that it is\r\ndifficult to detect them.\r\n\r\nThis insect is evidently closely allied to _A. nerii_, but differs in\r\nthe abdominal lobes of the female and in the antennæ of the male; its\r\nmale puparium is also much longer, and that of the female more convex,\r\nthan in that species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  5. Aspidiotus coccineus, Gennadius.[K]\r\n      _Aspidiotus aurantii_, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 199.\r\n      _Aspidiotus citri_, Comstock; Canadian Entom., Vol. XIII., p. 8.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n[K] The author has not been able to find the original description of\r\nGennadius, which appears to have been contained in a report to the\r\nMinister for Agriculture in Greece. Dr. Signoret states that there is a\r\nreference to it in \"Risso, Histoire Naturelle des Oranges,\" Vol. I., p.\r\n220.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium really dirty-white, but seeming yellowish-brown, from\r\nthe colour of the insect beneath; sometimes dark-brown; circular, flat;\r\ndiameter, about 1/11in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium much smaller, rather oval.\r\n\r\nAdult female yellow, becoming brown at last; peg-top shaped, but the\r\nabdominal segment is comparatively so small and is so much overlapped\r\nby the others that the insect looks almost globular; length, about\r\n1/15in. Abdomen ending in six lobes (of which the two median are the\r\nlargest), and several scaly hairs. No groups of spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male very small, brown or yellow in colour. The antennæ have ten\r\njoints: the two first joints are very small, round, and smooth; the\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, and sixth equal in length; the seventh, eighth,\r\nand ninth half as long; the tenth somewhat shorter still, and pointed.\r\nAll the last eight joints show numerous hairs. The thorax is short and\r\nthick, the thoracic band occupying more than one-half the width; the\r\nabdomen short, the double spike of some length. The wings are oval,\r\nabout as long as the body. The legs are hairy, femora thick, tibiæ\r\nlonger, thicker at the end next the tarsus than at the other end; tarsi\r\nbroad at the top, tapering gradually down to the usual single claw. The\r\nhairs on the femora are much fewer than those on the tibiæ and tarsi.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On oranges and lemons in shops, very abundant, often several\r\nhundreds on a single fruit; on orange- and lemon-trees, Governor's Bay,\r\nCanterbury; and Auckland.\r\n\r\nThis insect is European, and has been introduced here from Australia.\r\nIt is exceedingly destructive to orange and lemon groves in America\r\nand Australia. Mr. Comstock (Report of the Entomologist, U.S. Dep. of\r\nAgric., 1881, p. 295) records an instance where a grove of thirty-three\r\nacres, which in 1872 produced a rental of £1,800, could fetch in 1878\r\nonly £120, on account of the ravages of this insect.\r\n\r\nOrange- and lemon-growers in the north of New Zealand should beware of\r\nthis pest. It is scarcely likely that it should be harmless here when\r\nit is so destructive elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe remedies most likely to be efficacious have been mentioned in the\r\nintroductory chapters of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  6. Aspidiotus dysoxyli, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 198.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium circular, somewhat convex, brown in colour; diameter,\r\nabout 1/15in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium smaller, oval, brown.\r\n\r\nAdult female bright-yellow, corrugated, the corrugations overlapping\r\nthe abdominal region, which is comparatively small. There are four\r\ngroups of spinnerets, the upper pair with ten openings, the lower with\r\nnine, many scattered oval and oblong spinnerets. The abdomen ends in\r\nsix lobes, of which only the two median are conspicuous; between the\r\nlobes fine serrated hairs. The abdomen is very velvety.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Dysoxylon spectabile_, Wellington.\r\n\r\nAllied to _A. atherospermæ_, but differing in the abdominal lobes and\r\nspinnerets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  7. Aspidiotus epidendri, Bouché.\r\n      _Chermes epidendri_, Boisduval; Ent. Hort., 1867, p. 339.\r\n      _Aspidiotus epidendri_, Signoret, loc. cit., 1869, p. 121.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 197.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium circular, flat, dirty-white or brownish; diameter,\r\nabout 1/12in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium elongated, the sides parallel.\r\n\r\nAdult female greenish yellow, peg-top shaped. Abdomen ending in several\r\nlobes, of which only the two median are conspicuous; between the\r\nlobes several serrated scaly hairs, and some spines. Four groups of\r\nspinnerets: upper groups, eight to ten orifices; lower groups, six to\r\neight: many single spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male somewhat long, yellowish in colour; antennæ of ten joints;\r\nfeet having somewhat thick femora, the tibiæ and tarsi slender; all the\r\njoints hairy. The abdominal spike, or sheath of the penis, is rather\r\nlong, and the tubercle at its base is large.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On palms and orchids in hothouses, _passim_; on wattle,\r\nrarely, Christchurch.\r\n\r\nThis is a European insect, affecting hothouse plants, and scarcely\r\nlikely to do damage out-of-doors. It is closely allied to _A. nerii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  8. Aspidiotus nerii, Bouché; Schadl. Gart.

Trans., Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 217.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium circular, flat, white or greyish; diameter, about\r\n1/12in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium oval, white; about 1/25in. in length.\r\n\r\nAdult female yellow, peg-top shaped, but almost globular. Abdomen\r\nending in six lobes, of which the two median are the largest. Between\r\nand a little beyond the lobes are a number of scaly serrated hairs,\r\nsome of which exhibit serrated extremities; also some scaly but smooth\r\nhairs. There are also a few spines. Four groups of spinnerets, which\r\nare surrounded (according to Mr. Comstock, Entom. Report, U.S. Dep. of\r\nAgric., 1880, Plate XV., Fig. 1) by a fine line, as if enclosed in a\r\nsac. Many single spinnerets.\r\n\r\nIn the larva the abdomen ends in four lobes, of which the two median\r\nare somewhat prominent.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellow or brownish; antennæ of ten joints, each with several\r\nhairs; feet having the femora somewhat thick, the tibiæ and tarsi flat\r\nand slender, the former a little expanded at the extremity.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Coprosma lucida_ and _Corynocarpus lævigata<i/> (Karaka),\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nA species introduced from Europe, where its favourite habitat is\r\n_Nerium oleander_; but it is found on many other plants, and is,\r\naccording to Dr. Signoret, \"the commonest of all the species of this\r\ngenus.\" It has not yet spread widely in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  9. Aspidiotus sophoræ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 121.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium nearly circular, flat, bluish-grey; diameter, about\r\n1/24in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium oval; length, about 1/36in.\r\n\r\nAdult female of the usual peg-top shape, greenish-yellow in colour;\r\nabdomen ending in two conspicuous median lobes, with a number of scaly\r\nserrated hairs, as in _A. nerii_. Five groups of spinnerets: uppermost\r\ngroup with four orifices; the remainder, seven or eight. Some specimens\r\nshow only four groups.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Sophora tetraptera_ (Kowhai), Port Hills, Canterbury.\r\n\r\nOnly a few species of Aspidiotus are reported with five groups of\r\nspinnerets. The present insect differs from all of them in the scaly\r\nserrated hairs of the abdomen; none of the others has more than a few\r\nspines.\r\n\r\nGenus: DIASPIS, Costa.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium more or less, but never quite, circular; sometimes\r\nflat, but more usually convex; pellicles more or less marginal.\r\n\r\nMale puparium elongated, the pellicle at one end; a longitudinal\r\ncarina, or keel, appears in the middle.\r\n\r\nGroups of spinnerets, five.\r\n\r\nMr. Comstock (Entom. Rep., Cornell Univ., 1883, p. 85) remarks that,\r\nwhen the pellicles of the female of this genus are marginal, it might\r\nbe difficult to distinguish it from Chionaspis, as the male puparia are\r\nalike in both. As regards the species observed hitherto in New Zealand\r\nthis difficulty has not occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n  10. Diaspis Boisduvalii, Signoret; Ann. de la Soc. Entom.\r\n        de France, 1868, p. 433.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 200; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 23.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium oval, nearly circular, flattish; colour,\r\nyellowish-grey; diameter, about 1/12in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium elongated, white, with a strong median keel, and with\r\nthe edges raised so as to appear like two other keels; length, about\r\n1/20in. The male puparia frequently occur massed in great numbers, and\r\ncovered with white hairs and fluff.\r\n\r\nAdult female rather elongated, oval, or somewhat pear-shaped; the body\r\ncorrugated, the cephalic portion smooth. At each side, on a level with\r\nthe rostrum, or a little above it, is a protruding lobe, which is\r\ncharacteristic. Colour, light-yellow. Abdomen ending in two lobes, not\r\nprominent, and with a depression between them; beyond the lobes are\r\nmany serrations, with small lobelike projections and spiny hairs. Five\r\ngroups of spinnerets: uppermost group with five to eight orifices[L];\r\nthe two upper side groups with twenty to twenty-five; lower side\r\ngroups, fifteen to twenty. A few scattered single spinnerets.\r\n\r\n[L] Mr. Comstock (Entom. Rep., Cornell Univ., 1883, p. 87) gives eight to\r\nfifteen orifices for the uppermost group.\r\n\r\nAdult male very small, about 1/40in. in length; colour, reddish-yellow;\r\nantennæ of ten joints, all with hairs except the two first; femora\r\nand tibiæ slender, tarsi thick at the base, and tapering to the claw;\r\ndigitules, fine hairs. The first and second pair of legs appear\r\nsomewhat widely separated, owing to the length of the coxæ.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On several hothouse plants, Christchurch and Wellington; and\r\non wattle in gardens, Wellington.\r\n\r\nA European insect. The curious projections at the side, near the head,\r\nof the female, and the arrangement of the male puparia above mentioned,\r\nsufficiently distinguish this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  11. Diaspis rosæ, Sandberg.\r\n      _Aspidiotus rosæ_, Sandberg; Abhand., priv. Boh., No. 6, p. 317.\r\n      _Diaspis rosæ_, Signoret, loc. cit., 1869, p. 441.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 201.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium nearly circular, white, often aggregated in masses;\r\ndiameter, about 1/12in. Pellicles, marginal.\r\n\r\nMale puparium white, elongated, carinated; length, about 1/20in.\r\n\r\nAdult female deep-red in colour, elongated, the body deeply segmented.\r\nCephalic region very large, smooth. On each segment of the body several\r\nspiny hairs. Abdomen ending in two conspicuous lobes with a depression\r\nbetween them, and some spiny hairs. Five groups of spinnerets, but the\r\nlateral groups are almost continuous; uppermost group with about twenty\r\norifices; in the lateral groups, fifty to sixty orifices. No single\r\nspinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male orange-red in colour; antennæ ten-jointed, with several\r\nhairs on all but the first two joints; feet slender, hairy; digitules,\r\nfine hairs. The spike is somewhat long.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On rose-trees, Governor's Bay, Canterbury-Napier.\r\n\r\nA European species, stated by Mr. Comstock to attack, in America,\r\nblackberries and raspberries, besides the rose.\r\n\r\nThe deep-red colour and abnormally-large cephalic segment of this\r\ninsect distinguish it from all others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  12. Diaspis santali, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 122.\r\n                         (Plate IV., Fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium yellowish-grey in colour, sometimes with a greenish\r\ntinge; outline oval; very convex; pellicles at one end, black,\r\ninconspicuous; length of puparium, about 1/15in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium white, elongated, carinated; pellicle, black; length,\r\nabout 1/25in.\r\n\r\nAdult female orange-red in colour, peg-top shaped; the abdominal\r\nsegment very small as compared with the rest of the body, and the two\r\nnext segments overlap it. Abdomen ending in two conspicuous, prominent,\r\nmedian lobes, and at each side of them two semi-circular depressions:\r\nseveral branched and serrated hairs in the region of these lobes. There\r\nare no groups of spinnerets. There is no wide depression of the edge\r\nbetween the median lobes.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Santalum cunninghamii_ (Maire), Te Aute, Hawke's Bay; and\r\non pear, plum, and other fruit-trees at Whangarei, having probably\r\nspread from native plants.\r\n\r\nThe carinated male puparium distinguishes this species from Aspidiotus.\r\nThe absence of spinnerets is curious.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: MYTILASPIS, Targioni-Tozzetti.\r\n\r\nFemale and male puparia similar, or nearly similar, in shape, but\r\nthe male puparium is smaller. Puparia elongated, generally more or\r\nless mussel-shaped or pyriform, usually convex, more or less curved;\r\npellicles at one end. Male puparia not carinated. Five groups of\r\nspinnerets in the female, but the groups are sometimes continuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  13. Mytilaspis cordylinidis, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 195.\r\n                          (Plate V., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium pure white, elongated, very narrow; usually straight,\r\nsometimes curved; pellicles yellow, at one end; length, about 1/8in.;\r\nbreadth, about 1/30in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium similar to that of the female, but much smaller; length,\r\nabout 1/20in.\r\n\r\nAdult female pale yellow in colour, elongated, distinctly segmented.\r\nRudimentary antennæ on the cephalic segment. A few fine hairs at the\r\nedges of the segments. Abdomen ending in two lobes with a small median\r\ndepression; several serrated scaly hairs, and a few spines. Five groups\r\nof spinnerets: uppermost groups, seven or eight orifices; upper lateral\r\ngroup, fourteen to twenty; lower lateral group, twenty to twenty-five.\r\nA great number of single spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male doubtful; very minute and difficult to detect. Antennæ\r\napparently short and tibiæ large.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Cordyline australis_ and _C. indivisa_, _Phormium_,\r\n_Gahnia_, _Astelia_, _Eucalyptus_, &c., throughout the islands; but the\r\nchief habitat seems to be _C. australis_ (the common cabbage-tree), on\r\nwhich it is often very abundant.\r\n\r\nThis species may at first sight be mistaken for _Fiorinia stricta_,\r\ndescribed below, which also infests Cordyline and Phormium; but, on\r\ninspection, it will be seen that the puparium of the Mytilaspis is much\r\nwhiter, and the pellicles yellow, those of _F. stricta_ being black. An\r\nexamination of the second pellicles of the two species will, of course,\r\nat once distinguish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  14. Mytilaspis drimydis, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 196.\r\n                          (Plate V., Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium elongated, often straight, sometimes curved; colour,\r\ndirty-white or brown; pellicles at one end; length, about 1/12in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium similar, but smaller.\r\n\r\nAdult female dull-red in colour, elongated, not very distinctly\r\nsegmented. Abdomen ending in a number of small lobes, of which the\r\nfour median are the largest; several fine hairs between the lobes; no\r\ngroups of spinnerets, but a very great number of single ones, which\r\nare scattered on the segments as far up as the rostrum. Many of these\r\nprotrude as short thick tubes with serrated or fringed extremities. On\r\nthe cephalic segment are a few spiny hairs and two rudimentary antennæ.\r\n\r\nAdult male red in colour; antennæ of ten joints; tarsi somewhat large.\r\nBoth antennæ and feet have numerous hairs. Digitules, fine.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Drimys colorata_, Water of Leith, Dunedin, from which it\r\nhas spread to other native plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  15. Mytilaspis epiphytidis, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 21.\r\n                          (Plate V., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nFemale puparium flat, pyriform, brown in colour, thin; length, about\r\n1/11in.\r\n\r\nMale puparium narrower than that of the female, and a good deal darker,\r\nbeing sometimes almost black; length, about 1/20in.; not carinated.\r\n\r\nAdult female dark-grey in colour, elongated, segmented. Abdomen ending\r\nin two median lobes; along the edge several deepish curvilinear\r\nincisions, between which are some strong spines. Five groups of\r\nspinnerets: lower pair with fourteen to sixteen orifices; upper pair,\r\ntwelve to sixteen; uppermost group, four to six.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Astelia cunninghamii_, Wellington.\r\n\r\n\r\n  16.

The secretion forming the puparium is\r\nmixed with bark-cells of the tree, arranged longitudinally.\r\n\r\nMale puparium narrower than that of the female, and darker in colour.\r\n\r\nAdult female greyish-green, elongated, segmented; abdomen ending in six\r\nlobes, of which the two median are conspicuous and somewhat large and\r\nfloriated, the rest very small. Five groups of spinnerets: the upper\r\ngroup with about fifteen openings; the others with from twenty-five to\r\nthirty-five. Single spinnerets none, or very few.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Leptospermum scoparium_ (manuka), Wellington; Canterbury;\r\nAuckland. The puparia are often numerous on the loose scaly bark of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n\r\n  17. Mytilaspis metrosideri, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XII., 1879, p. 293.\r\n\r\nFemale puparium white, pyriform. Female in all stages dark-coloured; in\r\nlast stage nearly black. General outline resembling _M. drimydis_, but\r\nthe abdomen is much sharper and more pointed, with a finely-serrated\r\nedge, ending in three minute, pointed lobes, joined by a scaly process.\r\nSpinnerets in an almost continuous arch, which may be resolved into\r\nfive groups; seventy or eighty openings; several single spinnerets.\r\nThe rudimentary antennæ can be made out.\r\n\r\nThe young female has an elongated oval outline, little corrugated. The\r\nfeet, digitules, antennæ, &c., resemble those of _M. pomorum_. The\r\nabdomen is like that of the adult, without the groups of spinnerets.\r\n\r\nMale unknown, but puparium smaller and rather darker in colour than\r\nthat of the female.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Metrosideros robusta_ (rata), Wellington, and probably\r\nelsewhere. It is not common.\r\n\r\n\r\n  18. Mytilaspis phymatodidis, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z.

Colour\r\nstated by Riley (Fifth Missouri Report, p. 95) as \"translucent\r\ncorneous-grey.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat in New Zealand--On apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, lilac,\r\nash, thorn, sycamore, cotoneaster, and other plants, _passim_.\r\n\r\nAn introduced European species, known in America and elsewhere as\r\nthe \"oyster-shell bark-louse of the apple.\" It is the commonest,\r\napparently, of the Diaspidinæ; and does great damage in orchards.\r\n\r\nThis species has been referred to by many writers under the specific\r\nname \"conchiformis;\" some authors include it under the genus\r\nAspidiotus, others under Coccus, and one--Réaumur--under Chermes. In\r\nthe Quarterly Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, February,\r\n1885, Mr. A. Michael refers to it as _Coccus (Mytilaspis) pomicorticis_.\r\n\r\nThe groups of spinnerets have been stated above to be \"variable.\" The\r\nfollowing table shows the numbers observed in specimens from different\r\ntrees in New Zealand:--\r\n\r\n                Uppermost  Upper Side  Lower Side\r\n                 Groups.

The eggs, in most cases\r\nso observed, were shrivelled and dead. Mr. A. Michael, in the paper\r\nabove mentioned (\"Notes on Tyroglyphidæ\") refers to an Acarus found in\r\nAmerica in 1873, also in puparia of _M. pomorum_, by Mr. Riley, and\r\nexpresses doubts whether or not it fed upon the insect; yet he says, \"A\r\nTyroglyphus not ordinarily predatory might regard a Coccus as suitable\r\nfor gastronomic purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  20.

Five groups of spinnerets: uppermost group,\r\nsix to ten orifices; the rest, ten to fifteen.\r\n\r\nAdult male reddish in colour. Antennæ hairy, 10-jointed, the first two\r\njoints very short. Feet normal, with four long, fine digitules. At\r\nthe base of the abdominal spike is a somewhat large tubercle. Haltere\r\nof normal form, but the terminal seta is very long, four times as\r\nlong as the thick basal portion, and has no terminal knob. Thoracic\r\nband conspicuous. The thorax is somewhat long, so that there is a\r\nconsiderable distance between the first and second pairs of legs.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Coprosma_, _Rubus_, _Asplenium_, _Pellæa_, Riccarton Bush\r\nand North Kowai River, Canterbury; Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe female puparium resembles that of _C. aspidistræ_ (Signoret) and\r\n_C. populi_ (Bärensprung), but the abdominal segment of the female\r\ndiffers from both.\r\n\r\n\r\n  23.

Five groups of spinnerets: lower pair with\r\ntwelve to fourteen orifices; upper pair with seven to ten; uppermost\r\ngroup, four to six. A few spiny hairs are on the edge of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Dysoxylon spectabile_ (Kohe-kohe), Wellington; Hawke's\r\nBay; Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe large white puparia of this insect do much to spoil the appearance\r\nof Dysoxylon, one of the most showy-leafed plants in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  24.

Rudimentary antennæ visible. Abdomen ending with a median\r\ndepression, and inconspicuous lobes; several scattered spiny hairs.\r\nEight groups of spinnerets: four, containing each from twenty to thirty\r\norifices, are placed in opposite pairs, the fifth, with four to six\r\norifices, being between the upper pair; above these, three other groups\r\nform an arch, the two outer ones having eight to ten openings, the\r\nmiddle one three to five. Many single spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male of a bright scarlet or deep-orange colour. The antennæ,\r\ncovered with longish hairs, have ten joints, the first two very short\r\nand thick; the next five long, equal, and cylindrical; the eighth and\r\nninth somewhat shorter; the tenth fusiform, and as long as the seventh.\r\nThe legs are rather long; the femur thick, the tibia more slender,\r\nbroadening towards the tarsus, which is about one-third as long as the\r\ntibia, and narrows sharply down to the claw.

First pellicle small, at one\r\nend. Second pellicle, very large, almost filling the puparium, roughly\r\npyriform; abdominal region segmented; cephalic region large, oval;\r\nabdominal segments tapering, exhibiting at the extremity either minute\r\nserrations, floriated lobes, or tusk-like lobes, or a smooth curve;\r\nthe first abdominal segment sometimes produced into roundly-triangular\r\nlobes.\r\n\r\nMale puparium flattish, elongated; length, from 1/10in. to 1/8in.;\r\nwhite, thin; roughly pyriform, but narrower than that of the female;\r\ncentral portion slightly convex, seeming on the under-side to have two\r\nkeels; not carinated above.\r\n\r\nAdult female yellow or brown; segmented; at first elongated, the\r\ncephalic region comparatively large, but during gestation shrinking\r\nup until the insect assumes the form of Aspidiotus. Abdomen ending in\r\na minutely-serrated edge, with several small simple lobes, between\r\nwhich are longish spiny hairs. Spinnerets in an almost continuous arch,\r\ncontaining seventy to a hundred orifices; several single spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellow, slender. Antennæ, ten-jointed, as long as the\r\nbody; each joint except the two first long and hairy; the last joint\r\nfusiform. Feet, long and slender; digitules, fine hairs. Abdominal\r\nspike, slender, not very long, springing from a small tubercular base.\r\n\r\nThis is a variable insect in size, colour, edge of abdomen, and\r\nspinnerets. On the bark of _Pittosporum eugenioide_ a variety has\r\nthe extremity of the second pellicle richly floriated, other features\r\nremaining as above. It has not been thought advisable to erect all\r\nthese varieties into different species.\r\n\r\nThe male pupa, in its earlier state, is elongated, segmented, and may\r\nbe mistaken for a female of _Mytilaspis drimydis_; but differs in its\r\ngreyish-yellow colour, and also in the form of the puparium.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Atherosperma Novæ Zælandiæ_; _Astelia cunninghamii_;\r\n_Coprosma_, sp. var.; _Pittosporum eugenioide_, &c.; Wellington;\r\nCanterbury; Hawke's Bay; Otago; Nelson; Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe puparia of this insect are frequently covered by a species of\r\ntorulaceous (?) fungus which spreads over the leaf they are on in a\r\nthin, brown sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  27. Fiorinia grossulariæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z.

Segments bearing at the edge three sharp\r\nspines. The edge of the abdominal segment is much broken by serrations,\r\nand ends in two broadish median lobes, with two smaller lobes on each\r\nside. Several sharp, long spines are set in pairs along the serrated\r\nedge. Five groups of spinnerets, the three upper forming a continuous\r\narch.

First\r\npellicle, comparatively large; the second almost fills the puparium.\r\n\r\nMale puparium rather longer than that of the female, but much narrower;\r\ncarinated.\r\n\r\nAdult female elongated; segmented; colour, pink. The abdominal segment\r\nsomewhat long, the edge broken by a number of deepish curvilinear\r\nserrations, and ending in two inconspicuous median lobes, with three\r\nothers, much smaller, on each side. From the serrations spring some\r\nhairs. There are five groups of spinnerets, but the three upper ones,\r\nalmost or quite conjoined, form a nearly-continuous arch, containing\r\nforty to fifty orifices; the two lower groups have fifteen to twenty.\r\nThere are several single spinnerets. The adult insect, before\r\ngestation, nearly fills the space covered by the second pellicle; after\r\ngestation it shrinks up into very small compass at the cephalic end of\r\nthe puparium.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Brachyglottis repanda_; _Panax arboreum_, Port Hills,\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\nDiffers from the European species, _F. pellucida_ (Targioni), in its\r\nextremely-minute size, in the serrations of the abdomen, and the number\r\nof its hairs. Also in _F. pellucida_ the young female larva has two\r\ntubercles between the antennæ, which are not seen in _F. minima_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  29. Fiorinia stricta, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z.

Females after the first metamorphosis\r\nconstructing over themselves a carapace, shield, or (as called herein)\r\ntest, of glassy, waxy, or horny secretion. Test apparently homogeneous,\r\nreally in most cases formed of aggregated segments over the insect,\r\nand prolonged beyond the body in a flat single fringe of separate,\r\nmore or less triangular or quadrate, segments. Fringe not always\r\npresent or conspicuous in all stages. Males, after first metamorphosis,\r\nconstructing a test of similar character but varying form.\r\n\r\nThis subdivision, when first established by Targioni-Tozzetti, included\r\nonly the four genera _Pollinia_, _Asterolecanium_, _Planchonia_, and\r\n_Lecanodiaspis_, all of which are apodous in the adult stage of the\r\nfemale. In this work the two first of these are included in a new\r\ngroup, Hemi-Coccidinæ; _Planchonia_ belongs to the group\r\nCoccidinæ; _Lecanodiaspis_ is left in the present subdivision.\r\nFor the reasons leading to these changes, and the inclusion in this\r\nsubdivision of insects retaining the feet in all stages, see N.Z.\r\nTransactions, Vol. XI., 1878, p. 207, and Vol. XVI., 1883, pp. 125-128.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: LECANOCHITON, Maskell.\r\n\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 222.\r\n\r\nTest of adult female horny in texture, formed partly of secretion,\r\npartly of the pellicle of the second stage; abdominal cleft and lobes\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  30. Lecanochiton metrosideri, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 222; Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 129.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female brown, hard, horny-looking, convex, slightly\r\nelongated, open beneath, loosely attached to twigs by the edges; at the\r\ntop is the pellicle of the second stage, which is flat, and gives the\r\ntest the appearance of an overturned basket, of which the pellicle is\r\nthe foot. Length of test about 1/15in. Remains of the thin white test\r\nof the second stage may sometimes be seen on the pellicle.\r\n\r\nTest of the male small, white, glassy, elongated, convex.\r\n\r\nThe young insect, extremely minute, naked and active, is flat, oval,\r\nbrown, or rather reddish, usually found at the tips of young shoots or\r\non leaves. The antennæ have six joints; on the last joint are several\r\nhairs, amongst which is one excessively long, slightly knobbed. Foot\r\nnormal; the joints hairy; upper digitules fine knobbed hairs, lower\r\npair a little broader.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the female is scarcely altered: the antennæ and\r\nfeet remain as before; but there is a test, white, waxy, very thin,\r\ncovering the dorsal surface, and extending a little beyond the edge\r\nin an irregular fringe. On the edge also are a number of protruding\r\nspinneret tubes, glassy, white, cylindrical, either curved or straight:\r\na few of these tubes protrude on the surface of the back.\r\n\r\nAdult female dark-brown in colour, filling the test; convex above,\r\nflat beneath. Rostrum comparatively large; mentum probably monomerous.\r\nAntennæ short, thick, atrophied; seven-jointed, but the joints are\r\nmuch confused; on the last joint some hairs. Feet absent. Four rows of\r\nrather large spinnerets radiate from the median region of the dorsum\r\nto the edge, and along these, on the lower side of the test, are\r\ncorresponding narrow lines of white cottony secretion.\r\n\r\nThis insect is viviparous, the young being sheltered awhile by the\r\nmother, whose under-side becomes concave during gestation.\r\n\r\nAdult male dark-red; length, about 1/40in. Antennæ of ten joints, of\r\nwhich the two first are very short; the third much longer and expanded\r\nat the end; the fourth more than twice as long as the third; the\r\nremainder about equal in length to the third, but thicker and rounder,\r\nbeing almost moniliform. All but the first two joints bear hairs. Foot\r\nnormal; digitules fine hairs.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Metrosideros robusta_ (Rata), Milford Sound; Bluff\r\nHarbour. On _M. tomentosa_ (Pohutukawa), Auckland.\r\n\r\nA peculiar species, easily identifiable by the presence of the second\r\npellicle on the female test.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: CTENOCHITON, Maskell.\r\n\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 208.\r\n\r\nTest of female waxy, with a single fringe of tooth-like, more or less\r\nbroad, segments round the edge.\r\n\r\nTest of male waxy or glassy, with similar fringe.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the body, in the second stage of the female, usually\r\npresents a wavy appearance, formed by a series of reentering curves.\r\nThis is perhaps most conspicuous in _Ct. perforatus_.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ of the adult female have six or seven joints. It is often\r\nvery difficult to determine the number, as the third joint exhibits\r\nfrequently a shallow circular depression or ring which may easily be\r\nmistaken for a division.\r\n\r\nDuring gestation the female, which at first fills the test, shrivels\r\nup at one end into a shapeless mass requiring maceration in potash to\r\nrestore the original form for examination. The test thus becomes almost\r\nfilled with eggs.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the fringe, which is noticeable in every species of\r\nthis genus at some time or other, distinguishes it from _Ceroplastes_\r\nand _Vinsonia_. In _Ctenochiton viridis_ the test is not to be made out\r\nin the adult stage but is clearly visible in the second stage of the\r\nfemale, and it is present, with the characteristic fringe, for the male.\r\n\r\n\r\n  31. Ctenochiton depressus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 132.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female flat, nearly circular, thin, waxy,\r\ngreyish-coloured; fringe inconspicuous or sometimes absent. No\r\nperforations or rows of air-cells. Diameter, about 1/7in.\r\n\r\nThe fringe is more conspicuous in the test of the second stage.\r\n\r\nTest of male elongated, narrow, flat beneath, slightly convex above,\r\nwhite, glassy, thin and brittle, with a conspicuous fringe of which\r\nthe segments are truncato-triangular. The test is divided into\r\ntessellations, the median row of which is quadrangular, with two series\r\nof pentagonal divisions between it and the fringe. Near the abdominal\r\nextremity a transverse narrow slit cuts the test in two, leaving a\r\nsmall segment at the extreme end apparently separate. Length of the\r\ntest about 1/14in.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, but shrivelling after gestation; colour\r\nbrownish or grey. Antennæ of six joints, the third being the longest,\r\nand, as is commonly the case in the genus, often appearing like two. On\r\nthe last joint a few long hairs. Foot normal; the upper digitules are\r\nfine hairs, the lower pair only a little broader. Anal ring and lobes\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the usual wavy edge is conspicuous; the test is\r\nthin, glassy, with normal fringe. Antennæ and feet normal. The insect\r\nis somewhat thick, with yellowish colour.\r\n\r\nYoung insect normal.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellowish-red in colour, about 1/25in. in length, exclusive\r\nof the wings. General form normal. Antennæ long, with ten joints, all\r\nlong and equal, except the two first, which are very short: all the\r\njoints have several hairs. Legs normal, but the tibiæ are very long and\r\nslender, and only a little thickened at the tip; tarsi somewhat thick;\r\ndigitules fine hairs. Abdominal spike long, and very slightly curved.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Plagianthus_, _Cyathea_, &c.; Hawke's Bay.\r\n\r\nThis insect resembles, to the naked eye, somewhat nearly _Ctenochiton\r\nperforatus_, but the female differs in the absence of the curious\r\nperforations in the test of that species, and in the shorter and\r\nthicker antennæ, with also more long hairs on the last joint. The test\r\nof the male is also different.\r\n\r\n\r\n  32. Ctenochiton elæocarpi, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 26.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female oval, nearly circular, black in colour, divided\r\ninto hexagonal and pentagonal segments which are not conspicuous,\r\nand of which the median series forms a very slightly elevated ridge\r\nsomewhat lighter in colour. The test is only slightly convex. The\r\nfringe is very long and conspicuous, the segments tooth-like. Diameter\r\nof test, exclusive of the fringe, reaches 1/6in.\r\n\r\nTest of male unknown.\r\n\r\nTest of second stage of female white, waxy, not homogeneous, but built\r\nup of a number of loosely-aggregated tubuliform plates, somewhat\r\nresembling those of the genus _Orthezia_, Bosc. The fringe of this test\r\nis longer than in that of the adult, the teeth curling in different\r\nways. Length of test and fringe, sometimes 1/8in.\r\n\r\nThe adult female fills the test, shrivelling at gestation. Colour\r\nblack. Antennæ somewhat long, of seven joints; a few hairs on the last\r\njoint. Foot normal; upper digitules strong and thick, lower pair very\r\nbroad. On the skin are a number of large oval spots which appear to be\r\nthe orifices of spinneret tubes.\r\n\r\nFemale of the second stage wanting the usual wavy edge of the genus.\r\nRound the edge of the body is a row of sharp conical spines set\r\nclosely together. Antennæ of six somewhat confused joints. Feet normal.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Elæocarpus dentatus_ (hinau), Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe large size, black colour, and very conspicuous fringe of the adult\r\nfemale test, and the white loose test of the second stage, distinguish\r\nthis species, especially from _Ct. fuscus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  33. Ctenochiton elongatus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 212.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female elongated, narrow, convex. Length sometimes\r\nreaching 1/3in., width about 1/10in. Fringe not always conspicuous; the\r\nsegments quadrate outwardly. Test divided into quadrangular divisions.\r\nColour whitish, but often blackened by fungoid growths.\r\n\r\nTest of male unknown.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, shrivelling at gestation. Edge of\r\nthe body wavy. Stigmatic spines long and conspicuous. Antennæ\r\nseven-jointed. Feet normal; lower digitules absent (?).\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Geniostoma ligustrifolium_, Auckland; on _Dendrobium_ sp.,\r\nHawke's Bay; on _Earina_ sp., Wellington.\r\n\r\nEasily recognized by the great length and narrowness of the female test.\r\n\r\n\r\n  34. Ctenochiton flavus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 130; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 26.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nFemale test golden, waxy, flat beneath, convex above; outline circular\r\nor slightly elliptical, with a fringe of broadly triangular segments\r\nround the edge. Apex of the test an irregular elongated mass of wax,\r\nthe remainder divided into two concentric series of plates, the inner\r\nseries pentagonal with sharp angles, the outer pentagonal with rounded\r\nangles and with the outer side forming the base of the segments of the\r\nfringe. The inner series forms often irregular lumps of wax. Diameter\r\nof test sometimes reaching 1/9in. The colour is often hidden by black\r\nfungoid growths.\r\n\r\nTest of male much narrower than that of the female, having an\r\nirregularly rectangular edge with deep curvilinear depressions. It is\r\nglassy, white and shining, flat beneath and elevated above, and marked\r\nwith numerous horizontal striæ. The upper central portion is sometimes\r\nflat, sometimes an irregular mass of the glassy secretion. On the lower\r\nside there is often a plate of secretion, so that the pupa is almost\r\nentirely enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe adult female fills the test, shrivelling up after gestation: it\r\nis consequently flat beneath, convex above, with general outline of\r\nLecanidinæ. The spiracular spines are very long and conspicuous; from\r\ntheir base a double row of minute circular spinneret orifices runs as\r\nfar as the spiracle, with two or three outlying ones at the base of\r\nthe spine; and a single row of the same kind of orifices runs across\r\nthe body to the spiracle on the other side. Along the edge of the body\r\nthere is a series of conical sharp spines; and scattered all over are\r\nmany tubular projecting spinnerets. The abdominal cleft is deep, and\r\nthe two lobes are conspicuous on the dorsal side; these lobes are not\r\nsmooth, but irregular, and each bears at the end three or four strong\r\nspines. The antennæ have six joints; but the third joint often looks\r\nlike two on account of the false division or depressed ring: the last\r\njoint has several long hairs. Feet normal; the upper digitules fine\r\nlong hairs, the lower pair very broad. The anal ring bears a number of\r\nlong hairs, of which eight seem to be conspicuous. The colour of the\r\ninsect is a golden brown; diameter averaging 1/12in.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of the female is normal of the genus, showing the\r\nwavy outline, somewhat strongly marked in many specimens, but not\r\nconspicuous in others. The spiracular spines are prominent, and a row\r\nof conical spines runs round the edge of the body, as in the adult. The\r\ntest is at first very thin and brittle, and with a fringe of broad,\r\nshallow segments; but afterwards becomes thicker, and in the end,\r\nbefore the change to the final stage, it approaches almost the form of\r\nthe waxy test of an adult _Ceroplastes_.\r\n\r\nThe young insect is normal.\r\n\r\nThe adult male is normal of the genus. The legs are very long and\r\nslender; the four digitules are fine hairs. At the extremity of the\r\ntibia there is a strong spine. Abdominal spike, or sheath of the penis,\r\nslightly curved, with a seta on each side of its basal tubercle.\r\nAntennæ of ten joints; the first two very short, the rest longer and\r\nequal. On the last joint are several long hairs, of which three are\r\nknobbed.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Brachyglottis repanda_, _Panax arboreum_, _Leptospermum\r\nscoparium_ (manuka), _Elæocarpus dentatus_ (hinau); Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe species is distinguishable by the shape and colour of the test and\r\nthe arrangement of the spinnerets, in the adult female. The tests of\r\nthe second stage may sometimes be taken for adult _Ceroplastes rusci_,\r\nLinn.; but can be easily distinguished on examination of the enclosed\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  35. Ctenochiton fuscus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 131.\r\n                         (Plate VII., Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nTest of the adult female elliptical in outline, flat below, convex\r\nabove, the elevation being greater than usual; almost black in colour,\r\ncomposed of a thin dark waxy secretion. The fringe is conspicuous, and\r\nhas the appearance of teeth, the segments being sharply triangular and\r\nset closely together. Length of test sometimes nearly 1/4in., breadth\r\n1/7in., height 1/10in. Inside of the test whitish.\r\n\r\nTest of male glassy, white, elongated, slightly convex.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, shrivelling at gestation. Antennæ short,\r\nprobably seven-jointed, but the joints are confused; on the last joint\r\nseveral hairs. Foot having the tibia expanded at the extremity; upper\r\ndigitules strong and thick, lower pair ending in conspicuously broad\r\nplates. On the edge of the body a row of conical spines. Colour almost\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the female is less wavy in outline than in other\r\nspecies of the genus, and in its later period is somewhat thick, with\r\nthe edges turned inwards. Feet normal; digitules fine. Antennæ short\r\nand thick, with six joints, of which the third and fourth are the\r\nlongest; on the last joint some long hairs. The abdominal lobes are\r\nirregularly triangular.\r\n\r\nYoung insect normal.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Brachyglottis repanda_, _Panax arboreum_; Port Hills,\r\nCanterbury (Dry Bush).\r\n\r\nDistinguished by its large size, great convexity, and black colour,\r\nwhich is not due to fungoid growths, although these, as usual,\r\naccompany it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  36. Ctenochiton hymenantheræ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 25.\r\n                        (Plate VIII., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female waxy, circular, convex, dirty-white, yellow,\r\nor brownish, formed of a number of hexagonal or octagonal segments,\r\nwhich are also convex, giving it a rough appearance. Fringe not very\r\nconspicuous. Diameter of test, about 1/12in.\r\n\r\nTest of male glassy, dirty-white, oval, segmented, slightly convex,\r\nsegments of fringe small. Length, about 1/16in.\r\n\r\nAdult female yellowish-brown, filling the test. Antennæ of six joints,\r\nof which both the second and third seem sometimes double. Foot normal;\r\nupper digitules long fine hairs, lower pair broad. The spiracular\r\nspines are strong and conspicuous. The skin is divided into segments\r\ncorresponding with those of the test, the divisions being marked by\r\nlines of spinneret orifices which are small and simple.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the usual wavy edge of the genus is not generally\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nAdult male somewhat thick and short. Antennæ of nine joints, the first\r\nshort and thick, the remainder long and nearly equal; each joint after\r\nthe first has many nodosities, from which spring longish hairs. Foot\r\nlong and slender, especially the tibia. Digitules fine hairs. Thoracic\r\nband inconspicuous. Abdominal spike short and blunt.\r\n\r\nThis species is usually accompanied by a great quantity of very black\r\nfungus covering and rendering unsightly the whole plant on which it\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Hymenanthera crassifolia_, Evans Bay, Wellington.\r\n\r\nThis insect seems to be intermediate between _C. piperis_ and _C.\r\ndepressus_, differing from both in the rugose female test and the\r\ndistribution of the spinneret orifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n  37. Ctenochiton perforatus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 280; Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 130.\r\n                        (Plate VIII., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female white, waxy, circular, nearly flat, brittle,\r\nthin except at the edge. Fringe thin, segments broadly triangular.\r\nDiameter nearly 1/6in. The test is divided by narrow lines of minute\r\nspots, corresponding to the spinneret orifices of the insect, into\r\nrows of pentagonal or hexagonal segments. The interior segments are\r\nonly dotted, but the exterior row exhibits curvilinear series of small\r\nperforations or air-cells arranged in slightly radiating rows, which\r\nextend also to the corresponding segments of the fringe.\r\n\r\nThe test of the second stage of the female is very thin and filmy,\r\nwaxy, flat, slightly elongated; the fringe as in the adult; but there\r\nare no perforations or air-cells. Length, about 1/14in.\r\n\r\nTest of male waxy, thin, slightly elongated, rather convex; length,\r\nabout 1/15in. Fringe and air-cells as in the female test. At the\r\nabdominal end is a joint or hinge separating the last segment.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, shrivelling at gestation; colour greyish\r\nor greenish-white. General appearance somewhat leathery. Rows of minute\r\noval spinnerets run round the edge and across the body, corresponding\r\nwith the divisions of the test. Antennæ of six joints, the third joint\r\nbeing the longest, and seeming double on account of the depressed ring:\r\non the last joint some hairs. Feet normal, with somewhat thick coxæ and\r\nfemora: upper digitules long; lower pair narrow. Anal ring with eight\r\nhairs. A row of scattered small hairs runs round the edge of the body.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage very thin and transparent, seeming like a\r\nbluish-green film. The wavy edge is conspicuous. Antennæ of six joints.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellowish. Antennæ nine-jointed, every joint except the\r\nfirst bearing several hairs. Feet normal; upper digitules not long,\r\nlower pair fine hairs. Thoracic band conspicuous and long. Abdominal\r\nspike short.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Pittosporum eugenioide_, _P. tenuifolium_, _Panax\r\narboreum_, _Coprosma lucida_, _Rubus_, &c., Riccarton Bush,\r\nChristchurch; Nelson; Dunedin; Wellington.\r\n\r\n\r\n  38.

Colour variable;\r\nouter parts white, yellow, or greenish-white, central segments purplish.\r\n\r\nTest of second stage of female waxy, very thin, flat, with fringe of\r\nbroadly triangular segments: no air-cells. Length, about 1/30in.\r\n\r\nTest of male elongated, convex, glassy, segmented. Length, about\r\n1/20in. Slightly coloured like that of the female.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test. Colour corresponding with that of the\r\ntest. At gestation the under-side becomes hollow, and the young are\r\nsheltered beneath it for awhile. Antennæ seven-jointed; on the last\r\njoint several hairs. Feet normal; lower digitules rather broad. Round\r\nthe dorsal surface, half-way between the centre and the edge, is a row\r\nof swellings[O] or tubercles.\r\n\r\n[O] Possibly spiracular.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage elongated, the cephalic portion narrower than\r\nthe abdomen; flat, thin; edge wavy; stigmatic spines rather stout; a\r\nfew small spines on the edge. Antennæ six-jointed; feet normal.\r\n\r\nYoung insect of normal form, but with numerous minute wrinkles on the\r\nedge of the body.\r\n\r\nAdult male greenish-yellow; antennæ nine-jointed. Foot normal, with\r\nsomewhat thick tarsus. Penis ending in a round, somewhat large knob.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Piper excelsum_ (kawakawa); Auckland, Hawke's Bay,\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nThe regularly-circular form and coloured segments of the female test,\r\nand the tubercles of the dorsum, distinguish this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  39. Ctenochiton viridis, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 211; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 24.\r\n                         (Plate IX., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female absent or fragmentary; very thin, waxy, white,\r\ndivided into pentagonal or hexagonal segments, each of which exhibits\r\nnumerous concentric wavy curves, crossed by straight lines radiating\r\nfrom the centre;[P] the segments are separated by double lines of\r\nminute spots, corresponding to the spinneret orifices of the insect. No\r\nair-cells. Fringe seldom visible.\r\n\r\n[P] The radiating lines and concentric curves of these segments are\r\nusually somewhat conspicuous, at least on the adult female, and serve\r\nto distinguish the test from that of _C. elongatus_, which otherwise\r\nresembles it.\r\n\r\nTest of female of second stage very thin, white, waxy, flat, divided\r\ninto segments with concentric curves and radiating lines as in the\r\nadult. Fringe of broad segments. No air-cells. Length, about 1/15in.\r\n\r\nTest of male glassy, white, elongated, slightly convex, divided into\r\nsegments similarly marked to those of the female. Abdominal segments\r\nseparated from the test by a transverse line, or hinge. Length, about\r\n1/6in.\r\n\r\nAdult female bright-green in colour, thick, elongated or pyriform,\r\nthe cephalic portion somewhat acuminate; length sometimes reaching\r\n1/2in. It produces a conspicuous depression in the leaf, in which the\r\nbody is partially buried. Antennæ of six joints (apparently seven, but\r\nthe third joint shows the false division or depressed ring), often\r\natrophied. Feet normal, coxæ and femora thick. After gestation the\r\ninsect frequently becomes brown, covered with a mass of white mealy or\r\nfelted secretion.\r\n\r\nFemale of the second stage thin, filmy, translucent; flat, elongated,\r\nwith wavy outline; colour green; length, about 1/20in. Antennæ of six\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nAdult male greenish-yellow; length, about 1/15in. Antennæ of nine\r\njoints. Feet normal; digitules absent. A strong spine at the extremity\r\nof the tibia.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Panax arboreum_, _Coprosma lucida_, _Hedycarya dentata_,\r\n_Atherosperma Novæ-Zælandiæ_, _Rubus australis_; Canterbury, Otago,\r\nWellington, Nelson, Auckland, Hawke's Bay.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the largest known species of the Lecanidinæ. Its size\r\nand bright-green colour in the adult state clearly distinguish it. The\r\nfemale of the second stage resembles nearly that of _Ct. perforatus_,\r\nbut is somewhat thicker, and the markings of the segments of the test\r\nare different.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: INGLISIA, Maskell.\r\n\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 213.\r\n\r\nTest of female glassy, elevated, striated with radiating rows of\r\nair-cells. Fringe not always present in the adult stage.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Fairmairia_, Signoret, there is also an elevated test,\r\nbut it is waxy, and exhibits no air-cells, and has no fringe in any\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  40. Inglisia leptospermi, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 220; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 27.\r\n                         (Plate IX., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female white, glassy or waxy, elongated, convex above,\r\nflat and open beneath, formed of several agglutinated segments, each\r\nsegment more or less convex or conical, median segments usually five\r\nin number; at the edge an irregular fringe, but the fringe is often\r\nabsent. Average length of test, 1/10in. The marginal segments sometimes\r\nassume the form of small cones, as if a number of secondary tests were\r\nattached to the principal one. All the segments are marked with striæ\r\nradiating from the apex of each: the striæ, which are composed of\r\nair-cells, widen from the apex to the base.\r\n\r\nTest of the male white, glassy, elongated, convex, not unlike that of\r\nthe female, but with a longer fringe; it has also its posterior segment\r\ndivided from the rest by a transverse slit or hinge; average length,\r\nabout 1/15in.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, shrivelling at gestation; colour brown;\r\nabdominal lobes yellow, conspicuous. The flat under-surface is smooth;\r\nthe dorsum divided by large corrugations, each segment corresponding\r\nto one in the test. Antennæ of seven joints, of which the third is\r\nthe longest, the fourth, fifth, and sixth the shortest; a few hairs,\r\nespecially on the last joint. Feet normal; the tibia is somewhat thin,\r\nand has one spine or hair at its tip. Digitules normal; upper pair long\r\nknobbed hairs, lower pair very broad.\r\n\r\nThe female in the second stage is also convex above, flat below, but\r\nis less thick than the adult, and has not the corrugations. General\r\nform elongated-oval; the abdominal lobes are not, as usual, smooth,\r\nbut approach by irregularity the anal tubercles of the Coccidinæ, and\r\nlike them bear a few hairs. The anal ring has eight hairs. Antennæ of\r\nsix joints. Feet normal; digitules as in adult. On the skin are several\r\nscattered, circular, very minute spinnerets; the stigmatic spines are\r\nlong and conspicuous, and along the edge runs a row of conical hairs or\r\nspines.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellowish-green in colour, the body slender and tapering.\r\nFrom the abdomen spring two very long white cottony setæ, one on each\r\nside of the spike, which is straight and short. Antennæ of ten joints;\r\nthe first two short, the rest long, thin, and hairy. Of these, the\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth are the shortest; on the last joint three\r\nlong knobbed hairs. Feet slender, hairy; digitules normal. Thoracic\r\nband inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Leptospermum scoparium_ (manuka); Christchurch, Kaiapoi,\r\nWellington, Auckland. It affects the twigs of the plant, and not the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  41. Inglisia ornata, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 27.\r\n                          (Plate X., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female reddish-brown, the base more or less oval, the\r\nrest elevated in a cone and ending in a prominence standing up like\r\na more or less sharp horn; sometimes there are two of these horns.\r\nThe test is formed of a number of polygonal segments, each slightly\r\nelevated, and all are marked with the radiating striæ peculiar to the\r\ngenus. There is a fringe of sharply triangular segments, also striated.\r\nAverage length of test, about 1/6in., but specimens attain a length of\r\n1/4in.; height, about 1/10in.\r\n\r\nTest of second stage generally resembling that of the adult, but\r\nsmaller and less conical, and more tinged with green; and at the edge a\r\nnumber of short spinneret tubes may be seen protruding.\r\n\r\nTest of the male elongated-oval, convex, but wanting the prominent horn\r\nof the female, glassy, white tinged with yellowish-brown, composed of\r\nsegments marked with conspicuous striæ. Length, 1/12in. Fringe often\r\npresent, but irregular; often absent.\r\n\r\nThe adult female fills the test, shrivelling after gestation. It\r\nexhibits the horn, or two horns, as in the test. Antennæ of seven\r\njoints, the third joint showing the false division noted in other\r\nspecies of Lecanodiaspidæ. Feet normal; upper digitules strong and\r\nthick, lower pair rather broad. Along the edge of the body is a row of\r\nsharp lanceolate spines set closely together, and the spiracular spines\r\nare long and conspicuous. A double or triple row of minute circular\r\nspinnerets marks the divisions corresponding to the segments of the\r\ntest. Colour of the insect greenish, turning brown after gestation. The\r\nabdominal lobes are brown.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the female resembles generally the adult; but the\r\nantennæ have six joints, and amongst the marginal spines are some very\r\nmuch larger than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe young larva is flat and oval, and at the margin shows a fringe of\r\nlong glassy pointed tubes, springing from the marginal spines.\r\n\r\nThe adult male is about 1/20in. in length (exclusive of the wings),\r\nbrownish or reddish-yellow in colour, the wings hyaline and iridescent,\r\nwith red nervures. Antennæ of ten joints, on the last of which are,\r\namongst others, three long knobbed hairs. Foot with a spine at the\r\nextremity of the tibia; digitules fine hairs. At each side of the\r\nabdominal spike springs a strong seta, from which extends a white\r\ncottony pencil, as long as the body of the insect. The penis is a long\r\nsoft cylindrical tube covered with minute recurved spines. Thoracic\r\nband short and narrow.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Elæocarpus dentatus_ (hinau), _Leptospermum scoparium_\r\n(manuka); Wellington.[Q]\r\n\r\n[Q] The male pupæ may be found not unfrequently on other plants, such as\r\n_Coprosma_, _Pittosporum_, &c.\r\n\r\nThis is a handsome species: the colour and the horns of the test are\r\nclear distinctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  42. Inglisia patella, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 213; Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 219.\r\n                          (Plate X., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nTest of adult female conical or limpet-shaped, white, glassy, slightly\r\nelongated, striated with rows of air-cells radiating from the apex, and\r\nincreasing in size to the edge. Length of test, about 1/14in.; height,\r\nabout 1/40in. The edge is usually very wavy.\r\n\r\nTest of male similar, but a little smaller and more elongated.\r\n\r\nAdult female filling the test, shrivelling at gestation. Colour\r\ngreenish-yellow. Edge wavy, corresponding to the curves of the test.\r\nAntennæ very short, six-jointed; on the last three joints some hairs.\r\nFeet normal; upper digitules very long, lower pair narrow. On the edge\r\nof the body is a row of spines, of which each alternate one is conical,\r\nthe remainder club-shaped; the edge seems double or ribbon-like, and\r\ninside it is a row of spinnerets, beyond which is a narrow line of\r\nshort regular curves. Abdominal cleft wide and circular above, the\r\nextremities almost meeting. Anal ring with eight long hairs.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage flattish, elongated, wavy-edged; not exhibiting\r\nalternate conical and clavate spines.\r\n\r\nYoung larva naked, flat, active; round the edge a row of clavate\r\nspines, but no conical spines. Length, about 1/50in.\r\n\r\nAdult male greenish-yellow; length, 1/24in. Antennæ of ten joints, all\r\nexcept the first bearing hairs. Foot normal; digitules fine hairs.\r\nAbdominal spike about half the length of the abdomen, with two long\r\nwhite setæ springing from the basal tubercle.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Coprosma lucida_, Riccarton Bush, Christchurch; _Drimys\r\ncolorata_, (plentifully) on hill above Lyttelton; _Atherosperma_,\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nA very pretty little species, clearly distinguished by the form of the\r\ntest and the alternate spines of the adult female.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision II.--LECANIDÆ.\r\n\r\nFemale insects naked in all stages; form variable; apodous in adult\r\nstage, or retaining the feet; viviparous or oviparous, with or without\r\nattached ovisac; abdominal cleft and lobes always present. Male pupæ in\r\nsome cases covered with waxy secretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: LECANIUM, Illiger.\r\n\r\nFemales naked, flat or convex; viviparous or oviparous; propagating\r\nwithout ovisac; arboreal.\r\n\r\nDr. Signoret (loc. cit., 1873, p. 396) divides the genus into six\r\nseries, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) Species flat, usually viviparous; example, _L. hesperidum_.\r\n\r\n  (2.) Species more or less convex, elongated; example, _L. persicæ_.\r\n\r\n  (3.) Species more or less globular, the skin tessellated; example,\r\n         _L. aceris_.\r\n\r\n  (4.) Species more or less globular, the skin perforated with oval\r\n         markings; example, _L. hemisphæricum_.\r\n\r\n  (5.) Species rugose, with dorsal keels; example, _L. oleæ_.\r\n\r\n  (6.) Species globular, with cleft beneath for attachment to twigs;\r\n         example, _L. emerici_.\r\n\r\nThe following are the only species reported as yet in New Zealand; but\r\nthe genus is so widely spread and the species are so numerous that\r\ndoubtless many others will hereafter occur in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  43.

Antennæ of eight\r\njoints; on the first two and the last three joints some hairs. Feet\r\nnormal, rather long; one of the lower digitules is larger than the\r\nother. Length of insect, about 1/10in.\r\n\r\nMale unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat in New Zealand--On plants in greenhouses; Christchurch,\r\nWellington. In Europe, on _Ficus_, in hothouses.\r\n\r\nThis insect belongs to Signoret's fifth series.\r\n\r\n\r\n  44.

Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 29.\r\n                         (Plate XI., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nAdult female hemispherical, with broad flattened edges; reddish-brown;\r\ndiameter, about 1/15in. Skin regularly marked with oval perforations;\r\nno keels. Antennæ of eight joints. Feet normal, thin. Anal ring with\r\neight hairs.\r\n\r\nMale unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat in New Zealand--On Camellia, Hutt Valley, Wellington; in\r\nEurope, on _Dracæna australis_; in America, on various greenhouse\r\nplants (Comstock). Query--Does the European habitat denote an\r\nAustralian origin?\r\n\r\nThis insect belongs to Signoret's fourth series.\r\n\r\n\r\n  45.

Antennæ of seven joints; a few\r\nhairs on most, but the seventh has several. Abdominal cleft and lobes\r\nnormal. Feet normal. On the edge of a body a row of small hairs, not\r\nset closely together. Viviparous; at gestation the under-side becomes\r\nconcave, forming a shelter for the young; and this cavity is often\r\nof a blood-red colour. On the under-side may be seen sometimes four\r\ncottony trails starting from the region of the four stigmata.\r\n\r\nYoung larva reddish-brown; oval, flat; antennæ of six joints. From the\r\nabdominal lobes spring two long setæ.\r\n\r\nMale unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat in New Zealand--Everywhere, on ivy, holly, camellia, orange,\r\nlaurel, myrtle, box, and many other plants out of doors or in\r\ngreenhouses. In Europe, chiefly on ivy and oranges, but frequently on\r\nother plants. In America on many plants.\r\n\r\nThis is the commonest of the Lecanidæ in this country; it may be\r\ndistinguished from _L. mori_ (below) by its flatness and sparse\r\npunctuation.\r\n\r\nThis insect belongs to Signoret's first series.\r\n\r\n\r\n  46.

The insect appears to be partly oviparous, partly\r\nviviparous. Antennæ of eight joints. Feet normal. Skin pretty regularly\r\nmarked with oval perforations.\r\n\r\nMale unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat in New Zealand--On various greenhouse plants, Christchurch. In\r\nEurope on _Brexia_, _Phajus_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe insect belongs to Signoret's fourth series, and may perhaps be only\r\na large variety of _L. hemisphæricum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  47.

The insect excretes a\r\nnarrow, white, cylindrical cottony ovisac, which is conspicuous on the\r\nleaf of the plant, and the brown body of the female can be seen at one\r\nend of it. The eggs in this ovisac are numerous, perhaps some hundreds.\r\n\r\nLarva and second stage of female flat, oval, yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\nMale pupa covered with a waxy, elongated test as in the genus\r\n_Ctenochiton_, but there is no fringe and the segments of the test are\r\nnot conspicuous; the test is oval and convex.\r\n\r\nAdult male yellowish-grey, the head rounded, with an anterior\r\nprotuberance. Two dorsal and two ventral eyes, and two ocelli. Antennæ\r\nof ten joints, all hairy. Feet exhibiting only two digitules, the upper\r\npair. Abdominal spike short, with two longish setæ on each side, each\r\npair of which are covered with cotton which is produced into a long\r\nwhite conspicuous cauda.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On camellia. In the South, chiefly in greenhouses. In the Hutt\r\nValley, Wellington, camellias in the open air are much subject to it.\r\n\r\nThe female of this species is not unlike _Lecanium hesperidum_, but the\r\nformation of the white ovisac is a clearly distinguishing character. In\r\nlate summer the female often drops off to the ground, leaving only the\r\novisac observable on the leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision III.--LECANO-COCCIDÆ, Maskell.\r\n\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 128.\r\n\r\nFemale insects covering themselves with a secretion of cottony or\r\nfelted matter, forming more or less complete sacs. Male insects (where\r\nknown) covered with similar secretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: ERIOCHITON, Maskell.\r\n\r\nSecretion white, felted, formed of threads issuing from prominent spiny\r\nspinnerets; inconspicuous or absent on adult female, thicker on male\r\npupa. Abdominal cleft and lobes present in all stages of female.[R]\r\n\r\n[R] In both of the species here described the adult female has the tibiæ\r\nshorter than the tarsi. The author has hesitated to found a generic\r\ncharacter on it until the discovery of other species; the character is\r\nquite exceptional in the family, occurring (besides) only in some species\r\nof _Acanthococcidæ_. In all others a tibia shorter than the tarsus would\r\nindicate an immature insect.\r\n\r\n[This genus contains the insect named hitherto _Ctenochiton spinosus_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  51. Eriochiton hispidus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XIX., 1886, p. 47.\r\n                        (Plate XIII., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nSecretion of female white, thin, felted, formed of thin threads\r\nexcreted from the numerous prominent spiny spinnerets, the threads\r\nbecoming more or less matted over the dorsal surface. At the edge each\r\nthread corresponds to a spine, but has not the feathery form exhibited\r\nin the next species, _E. spinosus_, being more tubular. On the adult\r\nfemale the covering is often not to be detected, or presents only\r\nfragmentary portions; it is best observed on the female of the second\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nSecretion of the male pupa white, felted, thick, covering the insect\r\nall over, and exhibiting at the edge a small fringe. At first sight the\r\ntest, being obscurely segmented, presents somewhat the appearance of a\r\nDactylopid. Length of the felted mass, about 1/16in.\r\n\r\nLarva normal, flat, elliptical, active, exhibiting the usual abdominal\r\ncleft and lobes. Dorsal surface covered with spines, excreting a thin\r\nwhite mass of tubes and a tubular fringe.\r\n\r\nFemale of the second stage more or less elliptical, slightly convex,\r\nbrown in colour beneath the thin white felted covering, which usually\r\npresents a segmented appearance, due to the transverse rows of\r\nprominent spinnerets. Body covered thickly on the dorsal surface with\r\nspines, which are subcylindrical, the ends rounded, springing from\r\ntubercular bases. On the ventral surface many smaller spiny hairs.\r\nAbdominal cleft normal, the lobes large. Mentum probably monomerous:\r\nthe tip bears several hairs. Antennæ of six somewhat hairy joints.\r\nFeet with rather large femora; the lower digitules are fine hairs.\r\nAnogenital ring bearing numerous hairs.\r\n\r\nAdult female elliptical, convex, hollow beneath, brown in colour,\r\nusually affecting the twigs and branches of the plant in preference to\r\nthe leaves. Apparently naked, but on close inspection found to retain\r\nat least portions of the thin felted covering. Dorsal surface covered\r\nwith great numbers of spines similar to those of the second stage;\r\nventral surface with many small spiny hairs. Antennæ of seven joints.\r\nThe feet have large coxæ and femora; the tibia is only about half as\r\nlong as the tarsus; the lower digitules are only fine hairs.\r\n\r\nAdult male of normal form of _Lecanidinæ_: colour brown. On the head\r\nare six visual organs: two dorsal eyes, two ventral, and two ocelli.\r\nAntennæ reddish, ten-jointed; the second joint a good deal thicker than\r\nthe rest, the second, third, and fourth joints the longest; the last\r\nthree moniliform; all the joints hairy. On the five last joints are\r\nseveral hairs with knobbed extremities. Feet slender, hairy; digitules\r\nfine hairs. Abdominal spike short and rather broad. On each side of the\r\nbase of the spike is a tubercle bearing a pair of longish setæ; each\r\npair of setæ becomes enclosed in a long white cottony thread, and the\r\ntwo threads form conspicuous \"tails,\" as is common with most males of\r\nthe Coccid family.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Olearia Haastii_, Botanical Gardens, Wellington. This is\r\nan alpine plant cultivated in the Gardens, and the insect probably came\r\nwith it from the mountains.\r\n\r\nThis species is distinguished from _E. spinosus_ by the great number\r\nof spiny spinnerets on the dorsum of the female and by the tubular\r\ncharacter of the fringe.\r\n\r\nThe curious and exceptional character of a tibia shorter than the\r\ntarsus in the adult female, as observed above, is found only in this\r\ngenus and some _Acanthococcidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  52.

In America, on same plant.\r\n\r\nThis insect is not greatly different from _E. buxi_, Signoret; but the\r\nsac differs, and there are a few distinguishing characters in the form\r\nof the antennæ and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  55. Eriococcus hoheriæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XII., 1879, p. 298; Vol. XIX., 1886.\r\n                         (Plate XIV., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nSac of adult female white, cottony, irregularly elliptical, slightly\r\nconvex, often aggregated in masses; frequently so covered with black\r\nfungus as to present the appearance of a minute gall.\r\n\r\nSac of male white, convex, smaller and more elongated than that of the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nAdult female elongated-oval, convex, red in colour; length, about\r\n1/30in. Body segmented, tapering rapidly to the posterior extremity;\r\nthe cephalic segment occupying more than half the length. Anal\r\ntubercles conspicuous, apparently two, but on close inspection found\r\nto be four, brown in colour; two of them bear longish setæ; all the\r\nfour are much corrugated and bear many short spiny hairs. Anogenital\r\nring inconspicuous, with eight fine hairs. Antennæ of six short joints,\r\ntapering. Foot as if atrophied, the joints small and swollen; digitules\r\nall fine hairs. On the body are many small conical spines, which are\r\nmost numerous on the last two abdominal segments.\r\n\r\nLarva free, active, red in colour, flattish, elongated, tapering to\r\nthe abdominal extremity; length, about 1/50in. Body segmented; anal\r\ntubercles two, conspicuous, setiferous, with some short hairs. Antennæ\r\nof six joints; feet normal.\r\n\r\nAdult male red, about 1/20in. long; wings rather narrow, hyaline.\r\nAntennæ ten-jointed, hairy. Feet normal. Abdominal spike short, thick,\r\nand accompanied by a curved appendage; at each side a tubercle bearing\r\nlongish setæ.\r\n\r\nHabitat--In crevices (and sometimes on surface) of bark of _Hoheria\r\nangustifolia_, on hills above the town of Lyttelton. About midsummer\r\nindividuals may be found which have just completed their sac and have\r\nnot yet become coated with the black fungus.\r\n\r\nThe peg-top form and the four anal tubercles of this insect distinguish\r\nit from all others of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  56. Eriococcus multispinus, Maskell.\r\n      _Acanthococcus multispinus_, Maskell; N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI.,\r\n        1878, p. 217; Vol. XII., 1879, p. 292; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 29.\r\n                         (Plate XV., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nSac of adult female yellow, felted, elongated-oval. Length, about\r\n1/20in. Abdominal extremity open.\r\n\r\nSac of male similar to that of the female.\r\n\r\nAdult female pinkish in colour, elongated-oval, convex, filling the\r\nsac, shrivelling at gestation; segmented, segments not conspicuous.\r\nLength, about 1/25in. Anal tubercles brownish, conspicuous, setiferous.\r\nAnogenital ring small, with eight fine hairs, which are often glued\r\ntogether by cottony secretion, forming a pencil between the tubercles.\r\nAntennæ of six joints. Feet having the tibia shorter than the\r\ntarsus;[S] digitules fine hairs. On the dorsal surface are a great\r\nnumber of conical spines, of which the largest are arranged in six\r\nlongitudinal rows; from the spines sometimes protrude some cottony\r\ntubes with an expansion a little below the tip.\r\n\r\n[S] As a rule, a tibia shorter than the tarsus characterizes an insect\r\nnot yet arrived at the adult stage. The genera _Eriococcus_ and\r\n_Rhizococcus_ sometimes present exceptions to this rule. See also, above,\r\nthe genus _Eriochiton_.\r\n\r\nYoung larva free, active, elongated-oval, flattish; spines as in adult.\r\n\r\nAdult male orange-red in colour; length, about 1/25in. Antennæ of ten\r\njoints. Abdominal spike short, thick, with a curved appendage. Feet\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Rubus australis_, Riccarton Bush, Canterbury; on _Knightia\r\nexcelsa_, _Cyathodes acerosa_, Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe very numerous conical spines distinguish this species from that\r\nknown as _Acanthococcus aceris_, Signoret, the European species.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no sufficient reason why the genus _Acanthococcus_\r\nshould have been separated from _Eriococcus_, and they have been here\r\nreunited. The only difference mentioned by Signoret is the colour and\r\ntexture of the sac, an unimportant character in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  57. Eriococcus pallidus, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 29.\r\n                         (Plate XV., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nSac of adult female yellowish-white, elongated-oval, convex, closed at\r\nboth ends. Length, about 1/9in.\r\n\r\nSac of male unknown.\r\n\r\nAdult female greenish-grey, turning to brown after gestation; filling\r\nthe sac; shrivelling at gestation. Anal tubercles rather large and\r\nconspicuous. Anogenital ring small, with eight (sometimes six?) fine\r\nshort hairs. Antennæ of six joints. Feet normal, slender; lower\r\ndigitules narrow and rather long. Body segmented; segments not very\r\ndistinct. On the middle of each segment a transverse row of small\r\nslender conical spines not set closely together. Very many small\r\nscattered oval spinneret orifices.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Myoporum lætum_ (ngaio), _Elæocarpus dentatus_ (hinau),\r\n&c.; throughout the Islands.\r\n\r\nAllied to _E. buxi_, Signoret (European), and _E. multispinus_, ante:\r\nbut different from both in colour, in the arrangement of the spines and\r\nspinnerets, and in the form of the antennæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: RHIZOCOCCUS, Signoret.\r\n\r\nAdult females naked, usually stationary; body segmented; anal tubercles\r\nconspicuous. Antennæ of six or seven joints. Feet present. Anogenital\r\nring inconspicuous, with fine hairs.\r\n\r\nMale pupa enclosed in a cottony sac.\r\n\r\nMr. Comstock proposes (Ann. Rept. of Entom., U.S. Agric. Dept., 1881,\r\np. 339, note) to include in this genus all the species of _Eriococcus_.\r\nThe organic difference disclosed by the formation of a sac in that\r\ngenus and the absence of a sac in _Rhizococcus_ seems to render the\r\nseparation of the two necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  58. Rhizococcus celmisiæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 135.\r\n                         (Plate XVI., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nAdult female deep red in colour, elongated-oval, convex above and\r\nflattened below; length about 1/11in. The segments of the body are\r\nnot very distinct. The abdomen ends in two large and conspicuous anal\r\ntubercles, each of which bears one strong and fairly long terminal seta\r\nand three other spines. The anal ring has eight hairs. Antennæ of six\r\njoints, sometimes looking like seven. Mentum doubtfully dimerous. The\r\nfour digitules of the foot are long fine hairs. The tibia is a little\r\nshorter than the tarsus.[T] The trochanter bears one long hair and two\r\nshort ones. A few large conical spines (spinnerets) are scattered over\r\nthe body, and a row of smaller ones, like hairs with tubercular bases,\r\nruns transversely on each segment; also some circular spinnerets. At\r\nthe edge of the body, all round, is a row of the large conical spines,\r\nwhich are set in groups of three on the posterior segments, of four or\r\nfive on the median segments, and almost continuous on the head. When\r\nthe insect is alive these spines are often agglutinated with cottony\r\nsecretion so as to give the appearance of a short fringe. The four\r\nspiracles are somewhat large and circular.\r\n\r\n[T] See note, above, under _Eriococcus multispinus_.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Celmisia_ sp., Southern Alps, Canterbury.\r\n\r\nDiffers from the European _R. gnidii_ in size, colour, and habitat,\r\nthat species living on the roots of grass, while the New Zealand\r\ninsect is arboreal. There are also differences in the foot and in the\r\narrangement of the spines and hairs.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this insect may, in its latest stage, construct a\r\nsac: in that case, it would belong to _Eriococcus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  59. Rhizococcus fossor, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 136.\r\n                         (Plate XVI., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nFemale naked in all stages, but the adult usually buried in a pit.\r\n\r\nMale pupa enclosed in a white, elongated, cottony sac, which is about\r\n1/20in. long.\r\n\r\nAdult female greenish-yellow in colour, sometimes brown, stationary;\r\nsometimes resting on the leaf, usually partly enclosed in a circular\r\npit; almost circular in outline, flat beneath and slightly convex\r\nabove; length, about 1/15in. In the last stage, after gestation,\r\nit becomes dark-brown. The cephalic part is smooth; the remainder\r\nsegmented. The abdomen ends in two very small anal tubercles, which\r\nare nevertheless somewhat conspicuous on account of their brown\r\ncolour. Between them there protrudes a long thick pencil of white\r\ncotton. Antennæ short, with six joints, the last joint bearing several\r\nlong hairs. Feet very small; the femur rather thick; the tibia is\r\nshorter than the tarsus by about one-third; the four digitules are\r\nlong fine hairs. The anal tubercles have not terminal setæ; anal ring\r\ninconspicuous. A row of a few conical spines, set far apart, runs round\r\nthe edge of the body, but none elsewhere, nor any circular spinnerets.\r\nThere is no sign of a sac in any stage.\r\n\r\nFemale of the second stage oval, flatter than the adult, and of a\r\nrich golden colour; length, about 1/40in. The segments of the body\r\nare somewhat more distinct than in the adult. The anal tubercles are\r\nproportionately larger, and bear terminal setæ. Antennæ longer than\r\nin the adult, with six joints. Feet also longer. All round the edge\r\nruns a row of conical spines, set more closely than in the adult; and\r\nfrom each of these springs a long curly tube of white cotton, making a\r\nkind of fringe to the body; each tube is a little dilated at the end,\r\nand then tapers to a narrow point. The base of each conical spine is a\r\nsomewhat large tubercle.\r\n\r\nYoung larva free, active, elongated, slightly convex, tapering to the\r\nanal extremity; colour yellow; length, about 1/60in. Antennæ as in\r\nadult, with six joints. Feet somewhat large. Anal tubercles thick,\r\nconspicuous, setiferous, with one short hair. On the edge of the body\r\na row of conical spines set far apart, and on the dorsum four other\r\nlongitudinal rows.\r\n\r\nAdult male red in colour, about 1/30in. long. Antennæ of nine joints,\r\nall bearing hairs; the last joint nearly globular. Feet slender;\r\ndigitules fine hairs. Abdominal spike short, thick, with sometimes a\r\ncurved appendage. A rather strong seta on each side of the base of the\r\nspike.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the adult female is nearly buried in a circular depression,\r\nor pit, formed in the leaf, and with the wall of the pit somewhat\r\ncurled over it. On the other side of the leaf is a corresponding\r\nelevation, of a brown colour. Diameter of pit, about 1/18in. The\r\nabdominal pencil of cotton and the anal tubercles of the female usually\r\nprotrude at the edge of the pit, probably to attract the male. After\r\ngestation, the female disappears within the pit, and the young larvæ\r\nare also sheltered in it for a while.\r\n\r\nSometimes two females inhabit the same pit.\r\n\r\nThe females which are not in pits are generally of a dark-red, or\r\nbrown, colour.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Santalum Cunninghamii_ (maire), Te Aute, Hawke's Bay.\r\n\r\nA very distinct species, easily distinguishable by the pits on the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision II.--DACTYLOPIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe \"Mealy-bugs.\"\r\n\r\nFemale insects active or stationary; naked, or covered with mealy,\r\ncottony, or waxy secretion. Body segmented. Antennæ of from six to nine\r\njoints. Feet present. Anogenital ring large, usually conspicuous, with\r\nseveral long hairs. Anal tubercles small, inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nMales of general form of the family. Eyes sometimes facetted, usually\r\ngranular.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: DACTYLOPIUS, Costa.\r\n\r\nAdult females having antennæ of eight joints; anogenital ring with six\r\nhairs.

Length, about\r\n1/7in. Internal substance very oily. Anal tubercles inconspicuous,\r\nthick, with broad bases. Anogenital ring large, with six hairs. Feet\r\nnormal; upper digitules long fine hairs; lower digitules somewhat\r\nbroader. Antennæ of eight joints. On the dorsum a number of tubular\r\nprojecting spinnerets, and others circular. On each of the last three\r\nabdominal segments a row of large conical spines.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage dark-brown, active, elongated, segmented,\r\nflatter than the adult; length, about 1/20in. Anal tubercles\r\ninconspicuous, setiferous. A few conical spines on the posterior\r\nsegments. Antennæ of six joints. A thin mealy secretion on the body.\r\n\r\nYoung larva dark-brown, naked, active, elongated, segmented; length,\r\nabout 1/40in. Antennæ of six joints. Anal tubercles thick, broad, and\r\nmore conspicuous than in the adult. A few small spines on the dorsum.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On Veronica sp., Upper Waimakariri Valley, Southern Alps.\r\n\r\nA species easily distinguished by its cottony sac, its rich colour\r\nin alcohol, and its conical spines. It would seem to be intermediate\r\nbetween _Rhizococcus_ and _Dactylopius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  61. Dactylopius calceolariæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z.

Very short cottony appendages sometimes\r\nalong the edge of the body. Anal tubercles inconspicuous, bearing fine\r\nhairs, from which spring two long cottony filaments. Anogenital ring\r\nlarge, with six long hairs which are often glued together by white\r\ncotton, forming a pencil between the anal tubercles. Interior substance\r\nvery oily. Antennæ of eight joints, each bearing hairs. Mentum\r\ntriarticulate, with a few hairs at the tip. Feet normal.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage similar, but smaller. Antennæ of six joints.\r\nAnal tubercles somewhat more conspicuous than in the adult.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Calceolaria_, Christchurch; _Danthonia_, Stewart Island;\r\n_Phormium tenax_, Christchurch.\r\n\r\nThe large size, and the absence of long cottony marginal appendages,\r\ndistinguish this species from the European _D. adonidum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  62.

Body oval, tapering somewhat to the posterior\r\nextremity. Anal tubercles inconspicuous, each bearing fine hairs and\r\na long cottony filament. Anogenital ring large, with six hairs often\r\nforming with cotton a protruding pencil. A few cottony appendages\r\nsometimes round the edge of the body, often absent. Antennæ of eight\r\njoints, each bearing hairs. Feet normal; lower digitules rather broad.\r\n\r\nSac of male pupa narrow, cylindrical, white, cottony, open at the\r\nposterior end. Length, about 1/8in.\r\n\r\nAdult male about 1/20in. long; brown, covered when newly hatched with\r\nwhite meal. Body rather thick; abdominal spike short. Antennæ of ten\r\njoints, hairy; the last eight joints equal to each other.

Dactylopius poæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 220.\r\n                        (Plate XVIII., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nAdult female pink, covered with thin white meal; slightly elongated,\r\nsometimes globular; flat beneath, convex above; segmented, the segments\r\nindistinct. Length reaching about 1/10in. Antennæ of eight joints, very\r\nshort. Feet normal, very short; upper digitules short, lower digitules\r\nabsent (?). Anal tubercles extremely small and inconspicuous; each has\r\nthree conical spines, but no hairs. Anogenital ring large, with six\r\nhairs. On the dorsum are numbers of small circular spinnerets.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On the common tussock grass, _Poa anceps (australis?)_, Mount\r\nGrey Downs and Port Hills, Canterbury; either just above the ground, or\r\nmore often an inch or two below the surface.\r\n\r\nA species clearly distinct in form and habit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: PSEUDOCOCCUS, Westwood.\r\n\r\nAdult females covered with cottony secretion; stationary; antennæ\r\nof nine joints; anogenital ring conspicuous, with six hairs; upper\r\ndigitules of the foot absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  64. Pseudococcus asteliæ, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 139.\r\n                        (Plate XVIII., Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nAdult female about 1/10in. long, yellowish-brown, covered with a not\r\nvery abundant white cotton; segmented; anal tubercles inconspicuous;\r\nanal ring with six hairs. Antennæ with nine joints, of which the\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth are the longest; the second, sixth, and ninth\r\na little shorter; the first, seventh, and eighth the shortest. The\r\nfourth, fifth, and sixth are the narrowest, the two ends of the antennæ\r\nbeing thicker than the middle. The eighth joint is a little expanded at\r\nthe tip; and the ninth is fusiform, with a shallow depression at the\r\nextremity. All the joints have a few long hairs, and on the eighth is\r\none a good deal stronger than the others. The legs have the tibiæ twice\r\nas long as the tarsus; the claw is slender, and has no tooth on the\r\ninner edge. There are only two digitules (the lower pair), which are\r\nlong and fine. The trochanter bears one short bristle. The whole leg\r\nis slender and long. The eyes are tubercular and smooth, showing after\r\nmaceration in potash a small dark terminal spot. The body is covered\r\nwith a number of spinnerets of two kinds: those with simple concentric\r\ncircles are the largest, and are found all over the integument; the\r\nothers are multilocular, and are placed in groups at the edges of\r\nthe segments and also in great numbers at the cephalic and abdominal\r\nextremities. Interspersed with these spinnerets are several hairs,\r\nmostly very short, but on the head are some pretty long. From the\r\nanal tubercles spring two strong setæ with tubercular bases, not very\r\nlong. The mentum is dimerous, and bears a few hairs on the tip. In the\r\ngroups of spinnerets at the edges of the segments are found a few small\r\nconical spines. The four spiracles are small and simple.\r\n\r\nAdult male unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Astelia_ sp., in forests, Hawke's Bay.\r\n\r\nAllied to _P. Mespili_, Geoffroy; but differs in the antennæ, feet, and\r\nspinnerets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision III.--COCCIDÆ.\r\n\r\nAdult females active, covered with mealy secretion; antennæ of seven\r\njoints; no hairs on anogenital ring. Eyes of male not facetted.\r\n\r\nThis subdivision, which includes the single genus _Coccus_, of which\r\nthere would seem to be not more than one distinct species--_Coccus\r\ncacti_ (the cochineal insect)--and two or three varieties, has not yet\r\nany representatives in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision IV.--MONOPHLEBIDÆ.\r\n\r\nAdult females active or stationary; naked, or covered with mealy,\r\ncottony, or waxy secretion; segmented; antennæ of ten or eleven joints;\r\nanterior pair of feet similar to the rest; anogenital ring without\r\nhairs; anal tubercles inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nMales with facetted eyes and no ocelli.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the wings of the males of this group should,\r\naccording to its name, present only a single nervure. This, however,\r\nis not the case, or, rather, it should be said that the nervure is\r\nprecisely similar to that of all other Coccids, branching once, so\r\nthat it cannot form a distinctive character. Possibly the name of\r\n_Monophlebus_ was originally given by Leach to an abnormal or imperfect\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: ICERYA, Signoret.\r\n\r\nAdult females having antennæ of eleven joints; covered with thin mealy\r\nsecretion or with cotton; stationary; with or without ovisac. Rostrum\r\nand mentum present. Segmentation inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nAdult males without tassels on the abdomen; antennæ with two dilations\r\non each joint.\r\n\r\nTwo species only of this genus are at present known, the one described\r\nbelow and another, _I. sacchari_, infesting sugar-canes in Mauritius.\r\nThe male of the latter is unknown. Possibly researches in Australia\r\nmight result in the discovery of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  65. Icerya Purchasi, Maskell.\r\n      N. Z. Trans., Vol. XI., 1878, p. 221; Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 140;\r\n        p. 140; Vol. XVII., 1884, p. 30; Vol. XIX., 1886, p. 45.\r\n    _The \"Cottony-cushion Scale.\"_\r\n                             (Plate XIX.)\r\n\r\nAdult female dark reddish-brown, covered with a thin powdery secretion\r\nof yellowish meal, and with slender glassy filaments; stationary at\r\ngestation, and gradually raising itself on its head, lifting the\r\nposterior extremity until nearly perpendicular, filling the space\r\nbeneath it with thick white cotton, which gradually extends for some\r\ndistance behind it in an elongated, white ovisac, longitudinally\r\ncorrugated; ovisac often much longer than the insect, and becoming\r\nfilled with oval red eggs. Length of female, about 1/5in., reaching\r\nsometimes nearly 1/3in. Body previous to gestation lying flat on the\r\nplant, the edge slightly turned up; on the dorsum a longitudinal raised\r\nridge, forming one or more prominences. Insect covered all over with\r\nnumerous minute fine hairs, most thickly on the thoracic region; round\r\nthe edge these hairs are longer, and are arranged in tufts somewhat\r\nclosely set; the tufts are black, and contain from twenty to thirty\r\nhairs in each. Amongst the hairs in the tufts are several protruding\r\ntubular spinnerets, having on the outer end a kind of multiglobular\r\nring or crown; from these proceed cylindrical, glassy, straight tubes\r\nas long as the tufts of hair. Long, fine, glassy, delicate filaments,\r\nas long as the body of the insect, radiate from the edge all round;\r\nbut these, being very fragile, are often irregular, or absent. During\r\ngestation thick, short, cottony processes form at the edge of the\r\nthorax, seemingly attached to the feet. Antennæ of eleven joints, very\r\nslightly tapering; each joint bearing hairs. Feet normal, somewhat\r\nthick. Rostrum not long; mentum triarticulate. Procreation commencing\r\nsoon after the first formation of the ovisac, the eggs being ejected\r\ninto the sac as it grows; ovisac at completion containing sometimes as\r\nmany as 350 eggs; ovisac convex above, sometimes irregularly split,\r\nmore often nearly conical, divided by several regular longitudinal\r\ngrooves or ribs.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage dark-red, elongated, slightly convex, active,\r\ncovered with thin meal, or short curly cotton. Body hairy with marginal\r\ntufts and spinnerets, as in adult. Anal tubercles inconspicuous,\r\nbut the abdomen exhibits three small lobes on each side, from which\r\nspring six short setæ. Antennæ of nine nearly equal joints, hairy.\r\nFeet normal, thick. Several radiating, fine cottony filaments. Length\r\nof insect variable, from 1/10in. to 1/6in. The dorsum exhibits the\r\nlongitudinal raised ridge, but less conspicuously than in the adult.\r\n\r\nYoung larva, about 1/24in. long, dark-red, elongated, flattish, active;\r\ncovered with yellow cottony down. Antennæ of six joints, hairy; the\r\nlast joint is much the largest, clavate, apparently four-ringed,\r\nbearing four long hairs. Feet slender; digitules short, fine hairs.\r\nEyes prominent, tubercular. Mentum biarticulate. Anal tubercles\r\nrepresented by three small processes at each side of the abdominal\r\nextremity, each process bearing a very long seta. Six longitudinal\r\nrows of circular multilocular spinnerets, four on the dorsum and one\r\non each edge. Alternating with these are rows of hairs with tubercular\r\nbases.\r\n\r\nAdult male large, the length slightly varying; some specimens reach\r\n1/8in.; expanse of wings, 1/4in.; length of antennæ, about 1/8in. Body\r\nred, with a shining, diamond-shaped, black patch on the dorsal surface\r\nof the thorax; legs and antennæ black. Wings dark-brown with (in some\r\nlights) a bluish tinge, marked with oblique, narrow, wavy stripes; main\r\nnervure red, branching once; there are also two longitudinal, whitish,\r\nnarrow bands.[U] Antennæ very long and slender, with ten joints, which\r\nmay easily be taken for nineteen, for, after the first which is short,\r\nround, and simple, all the other nine have two dilated portions with\r\na constriction in the middle, and on each dilation is a ring of very\r\nlong hairs, giving the antenna a feathery appearance.[V] Eyes very\r\nlarge and prominent, almost pedunculated, brown, divided into numerous\r\nsemi-globular facets. Feet long and very hairy; coxæ short and thick,\r\ntibiæ long and slender, claw thin; upper digitules absent, lower pair\r\nonly short bristles. Abdomen slender, segments somewhat distinct;\r\non each segment some hairs; the last segment ends in two thick,\r\nconspicuous, cylindrical processes, which, in side view, are seen to\r\nincline upwards, and beneath them is the short, conical spike sheathing\r\nthe penis. Penis red, longish, tubular, and thick, with many recurved\r\nshort hairs, and at the end a ring of short spines. Each of the two\r\nprocesses on the last segment bears three or four long setæ, but there\r\ndo not appear to be any of the long cottony appendages seen in the\r\nmales of most Coccids.\r\n\r\n[U] Signoret (Ann. de la Soc. Ent. de France, 1875), under the genus\r\n_Monophlebus_, speaks of \"les plis hyalins\" as existing also in the wings\r\nof the males of that genus.\r\n\r\n[V] Misled by similar appearances, Burmeister and Westwood assign\r\ntwenty-five joints to the male antenna of _Leachia fuscipennis_.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On wattle, pine, orange, lemon, cypress, rose, gorse, grass,\r\nand, in fact, on almost every kind of native and introduced plants,\r\nNelson, Hawke's Bay, Auckland. It will probably appear also elsewhere,\r\nbut the climate of Canterbury and Otago may prove too cold in winter\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nAllied to _I. sacchari_, Guérin, which damages sugar-canes in\r\nMauritius; but differing in the formation of the ovisac, the presence\r\nof the marginal tufts and spinneret tubes in the female, and in other\r\nparticulars. The male of _I. sacchari_ has not been described. The male\r\nof _I. Purchasi_ is probably quite distinct.\r\n\r\nThis species is supposed to have come originally from Australia. It has\r\nbeen very injurious to orange and lemon trees at the Cape of Good Hope\r\nand in California. In Auckland it has destroyed whole orchards of the\r\nsame trees, and in Nelson and Hawke's Bay it is a dreadful pest on all\r\nkinds of plants.\r\n\r\nTree-growers should especially beware of this insect, and the best plan\r\nto adopt would be to burn at once any tree found infested with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus: CŒLOSTOMA, Maskell.\r\n\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XII., 1889, p. 294.\r\n\r\nAdult females with antennæ of eleven joints; segmented; naked, active;\r\nat gestation becoming stationary and enclosed in a thick mass of white\r\ncottony secretion. Anal tubercles absent or inconspicuous. Rostrum and\r\nmentum absent in the adult female.\r\n\r\nMales with prominent, facetted eyes; ocelli absent. Abdomen without\r\ntassels.\r\n\r\nIn one New Zealand species the female in the second stage is\r\nstationary, enclosed in a thick, hard mass of waxy secretion, of which\r\nsome account is given in Chap. III. The other species included in this\r\nwork inhabits a remote and scarcely visited district, and the female\r\nhas not hitherto been found; it is not possible therefore to include\r\nthe excretion of wax and the stationary position amongst the generic\r\ncharacters at present.\r\n\r\nThis genus is allied to _Porphyrophora_, Brandt, and to _Monophlebus_,\r\nLeach; differing from the former by the presence of an œsophagal\r\norifice, and from the latter by the absence of tassels on the abdomen\r\nof the male. In the genus _Ortonia_, Signoret, the female possesses a\r\nrostrum and mentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  66. Cœlostoma zealandicum, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z. Trans., Vol. XII., 1879, p. 294; Vol. XIV., 1881, p. 226;\r\n        Vol. XVI., 1883, p. 141.\r\n                   (Plate XX.; Plate XXI., Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nAdult female brick-red, elongated, distinctly segmented, convex; length\r\nabout 1/2in.; before gestation active, naked or covered with thin\r\nmeal; during gestation stationary, enclosed in a thick mass of white\r\ncotton. Antennæ of eleven joints, tapering to the tip; the joints all\r\nnearly equal, and bearing several hairs. Feet black, short, strong;\r\nall the pairs placed somewhat forward; digitules absent, a short seta\r\nat the base of the claw; on the inner edge of the tibia and tarsus a\r\nfringe of strong hairs; on the trochanter a long hair. Rostrum and\r\nmentum absent; mouth represented by a minute orifice between the\r\nsecond pair of feet. Eyes very minute, tubercular, projecting, placed\r\nbehind the antennæ. Anal tubercles absent; anogenital opening small,\r\nelliptical, simple, hairless. Body flattish beneath, more convex above;\r\nsegments distinct, generally smooth, sometimes bearing hard projecting\r\ncallosities. Skin covered with minute hairs interspersed with circular\r\nspinnerets.\r\n\r\nFemale of second stage deep-red in colour, nearly globular, very\r\nindistinctly segmented; stationary, enclosed in a thick, hard solid\r\ntest of yellow wax; tests attaining sometimes the size of a large pea;\r\nenclosed insect averaging 1/5in. in length. Insect filling the test;\r\nskin smooth, very thin; general appearance like a hard, round, smooth\r\nball. Anal tubercles absent; anogenital ring small, simple, hairless:\r\nfrom this ring springs often a tuft of short white cotton, and a long\r\nwhite cottony seta protruding through an orifice in the test. Rostrum\r\nand mentum present, very small; mentum triarticulate, with a few hairs\r\nat the tip. Antennæ very short, of eight joints, conical, tapering\r\nto the tip, hairy. Feet atrophied, bloated-looking, apparently only\r\nconsisting of a very short femur, tibia, and tarsus; digitules two,\r\nvery small. Skin covered with a great number of circular spinnerets of\r\ntwo sizes, the larger ones simple, the smaller multilocular. Tracheæ\r\nvery large; spiracular orifices containing brown tubes with beaded\r\nextremities on the inner end. Anal extremity dark-brown, the anal ring\r\nin the centre; spinnerets here very numerous, converging towards the\r\nanus. Insect in this stage emitting a strong, persistent, and fetid\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nYoung larva brick-red, elongated, active, naked; length, about 1/24in.\r\nAntennæ of six joints, hairy; last joint the largest, clavate. Eyes\r\nand feet as in adult, but there is no fringe on the tibia and tarsus.\r\nRostrum and mentum large, conspicuous. Skin covered with circular\r\nspinnerets and minute hairs; the spinnerets are most numerous on the\r\nabdomen. Anogenital ring apparently folded. At the extremity of the\r\nabdomen two long hairs springing from quadrate tubercular bases which\r\nrepresent the anal tubercles.\r\n\r\nAdult male red or purplish in colour, wings bluish-purple with red\r\nnervures; length, about 1/5in.; width across expanded wings, about\r\n1/2in. Eyes large, prominent, facetted. Antennæ of ten joints, each\r\njoint bearing many hairs. Feet long, slender, with somewhat large\r\ntrochanter; on the tibia and tarsus a fringe of hairs as in the female.\r\nUpper digitules two long fine hairs; lower digitules absent. The\r\nnervure of the wings branches twice at least. Haltere large, inflated,\r\nsac-like; bearing four curling setæ. Abdomen distinctly segmented, each\r\nsegment bearing many fine short hairs and several small circular marks.\r\nAbdominal spike short, broad, bivalvular; penis protruding as a long\r\nsoft white tube covered with minute recurved hairs.\r\n\r\nHabitat--For the adult female and larva the trunks of trees and shrubs\r\nin forests, or rocks and bushes in open country, Otago, Nelson,\r\nCanterbury, Wellington. For the second stage the stems and roots of\r\n_Muhlenbeckia adspersa (complexa?)_; Sumner Road, Lyttelton; Evans\r\nBay, Wellington: _Rhipogonum scandens_ (supplejack); Riccarton Bush,\r\nCanterbury; Nelson; Wellington. On _Muhlenbeckia_ the waxy tests are\r\noften largest and most numerous underground. Male insects sometimes\r\nfound clustering, attached to females.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large and peculiar species, its transformations and\r\nchanges of secretion being abnormal. It cannot be said to be greatly\r\nharmful; but the odour of the second stage is unpleasant.\r\n\r\n  67. Cœlostoma wairoense, Maskell.\r\n      N.Z.

Length of body, about 1/6in.\r\nEyes prominent, facetted. Antennæ of ten joints, slender, with fine\r\nhairs. Feet as in _C. zealandicum_, but with fewer hairs. Digitules\r\ntwenty-four, all springing from the claw, none from the tarsus.\r\nHaltere, abdominal spike, penis, and abdomen as in _C. zealandicum_;\r\nbut the circular marks on the segments in this species are multilocular.\r\n\r\nMale pupa bright-red, enclosed in a cylindrical sac of white cotton.\r\nPupæ occurring in numerous colonies.\r\n\r\nHabitat--On _Phormium tenax_, _Leptospermum scoparium_ (manuka),\r\nNorthern Wairoa, Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe female of this species will, when found, probably nearly resemble\r\nthat of _C. zealandicum_: at present the great number of digitules on\r\nthe foot of the male sufficiently distinguish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF PLANTS AND THE COCCIDIDÆ ATTACKING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list is of course only approximate, as insects may at any time be\r\nfound on other trees than those given.\r\n\r\n_Icerya Purchasi_ is omnivorous, and it has not been thought necessary\r\nto repeat it here against every plant in the list; but it has been set\r\nagainst some.\r\n\r\nThe adult female of _Cœlostoma zælandicum_ may also be found wandering\r\nover numbers of native trees in forests.\r\n\r\nIn hothouses and greenhouses all sorts of plants are liable to attack.\r\n\r\n        Key to Symbols Following Insect Listings\r\n\r\n            * Unsightly: spoiling appearance of plant.\r\n            † Usually accompanied by much black fungus.\r\n            ‡ Likely to do much injury to plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Plants.

Orange- and lemon-growers (and indeed other\r\ntree-growers) in New Zealand, especially in the North Island, should\r\ntake note of this fact, and beware of ever letting this omnivorous and\r\nmost destructive insect obtain any footing on their trees. _A speedy\r\nburning of every infected tree is the best remedy in this case._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nAll illustrations moved so as to not split paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe notes explaining the damage done by the insects in the \"INDEX OF\r\nPLANTS AND THE COCCIDIDÆ ATTACKING THEM.\" were moved before the table.",
