Those which we had were few and dull, and the pictures\r\nin them ugly and mean: while you have your choice of books without\r\nnumber, clear, amusing, and pretty, as well as really instructive, on\r\nsubjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by a few learned men,\r\nand very little understood even by them.  So if mere reading of books\r\nwould make wise men, you ought to grow up much wiser than us old fellows.\r\nBut mere reading of wise books will not make you wise men: you must use\r\nfor yourselves the tools with which books are made wise; and that is--your\r\neyes, and ears, and common sense.\r\n\r\nNow, among those very stupid old-fashioned boys' books was one which\r\ntaught me that; and therefore I am more grateful to it than if it had\r\nbeen as full of wonderful pictures as all the natural history books you\r\never saw.  Its name was _Evenings at Home_; and in it was a story called\r\n\"Eyes and no Eyes;\" a regular old-fashioned, prim, sententious story; and\r\nit began thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Robert, where have you been walking this afternoon?\" said Mr.\r\nAndrews to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday.\r\n\r\nOh--Robert had been to Broom Heath, and round by Camp Mount, and home\r\nthrough the meadows.  But it was very dull.  He hardly saw a single\r\nperson.  He had much rather have gone by the turnpike-road.\r\n\r\nPresently in comes Master William, the other pupil, dressed, I suppose,\r\nas wretched boys used to be dressed forty years ago, in a frill collar,\r\nand skeleton monkey-jacket, and tight trousers buttoned over it, and\r\nhardly coming down to his ancles; and low shoes, which always came off in\r\nsticky ground; and terribly dirty and wet he is: but he never (he says)\r\nhad such a pleasant walk in his life; and he has brought home his\r\nhandkerchief (for boys had no pockets in those days much bigger than key-\r\nholes) full of curiosities.\r\n\r\nHe has got a piece of mistletoe, wants to know what it is; and he has\r\nseen a woodpecker, and a wheat-ear, and gathered strange flowers on the\r\nheath; and hunted a peewit because he thought its wing was broken, till\r\nof course it led him into a bog, and very wet he got.  But he did not\r\nmind it, because he fell in with an old man cutting turf, who told him\r\nall about turf-cutting, and gave him a dead adder.  And then he went up a\r\nhill, and saw a grand prospect; and wanted to go again, and make out the\r\ngeography of the country from Cary's old county maps, which were the only\r\nmaps in those days.  And then, because the hill was called Camp Mount, he\r\nlooked for a Roman camp, and found one; and then he went down to the\r\nriver, saw twenty things more; and so on, and so on, till he had brought\r\nhome curiosities enough, and thoughts enough, to last him a week.\r\n\r\nWhereon Mr. Andrews, who seems to have been a very sensible old\r\ngentleman, tells him all about his curiosities: and then it comes out--if\r\nyou will believe it--that Master William has been over the very same\r\nground as Master Robert, who saw nothing at all.\r\n\r\nWhereon Mr. Andrews says, wisely enough, in his solemn old-fashioned\r\nway,--\r\n\r\n\"So it is.  One man walks through the world with his eyes open, another\r\nwith his eyes shut; and upon this difference depends all the superiority\r\nof knowledge which one man acquires over another.  I have known sailors\r\nwho had been in all the quarters of the world, and could tell you nothing\r\nbut the signs of the tippling-houses, and the price and quality of the\r\nliquor.  On the other hand, Franklin could not cross the Channel without\r\nmaking observations useful to mankind.  While many a vacant thoughtless\r\nyouth is whirled through Europe without gaining a single idea worth\r\ncrossing the street for, the observing eye and inquiring mind find matter\r\nof improvement and delight in every ramble.  You, then, William, continue\r\nto use your eyes.  And you, Robert, learn that eyes were given to you to\r\nuse.\"\r\n\r\nSo said Mr. Andrews: and so I say, dear boys--and so says he who has the\r\ncharge of you--to you.  Therefore I beg all good boys among you to think\r\nover this story, and settle in their own minds whether they will be eyes\r\nor no eyes; whether they will, as they grow up, look and see for\r\nthemselves what happens: or whether they will let other people look for\r\nthem, or pretend to look; and dupe them, and lead them about--the blind\r\nleading the blind, till both fall into the ditch.\r\n\r\nI say \"good boys;\" not merely clever boys, or prudent boys: because using\r\nyour eyes, or not using them, is a question of doing Right or doing\r\nWrong.  God has given you eyes; it is your duty to God to use them.  If\r\nyour parents tried to teach you your lessons in the most agreeable way,\r\nby beautiful picture-books, would it not be ungracious, ungrateful, and\r\naltogether naughty and wrong, to shut your eyes to those pictures, and\r\nrefuse to learn?  And is it not altogether naughty and wrong to refuse to\r\nlearn from your Father in Heaven, the Great God who made all things, when\r\nhe offers to teach you all day long by the most beautiful and most\r\nwonderful of all picture-books, which is simply all things which you can\r\nsee, hear, and touch, from the sun and stars above your head to the\r\nmosses and insects at your feet?  It is your duty to learn His lessons:\r\nand it is your interest.  God's Book, which is the Universe, and the\r\nreading of God's Book, which is Science, can do you nothing but good, and\r\nteach you nothing but truth and wisdom.  God did not put this wondrous\r\nworld about your young souls to tempt or to mislead them.  If you ask Him\r\nfor a fish, he will not give you a serpent.  If you ask Him for bread, He\r\nwill not give you a stone.\r\n\r\nSo use your eyes and your intellect, your senses and your brains, and\r\nlearn what God is trying to teach you continually by them.  I do not mean\r\nthat you must stop there, and learn nothing more.  Anything but that.\r\nThere are things which neither your senses nor your brains can tell you;\r\nand they are not only more glorious, but actually more true and more real\r\nthan any things which you can see or touch.  But you must begin at the\r\nbeginning in order to end at the end, and sow the seed if you wish to\r\ngather the fruit.  God has ordained that you, and every child which comes\r\ninto the world, should begin by learning something of the world about him\r\nby his senses and his brain; and the better you learn what they can teach\r\nyou, the more fit you will be to learn what they cannot teach you.  The\r\nmore you try now to understand _things_, the more you will be able\r\nhereafter to understand men, and That which is above men.  You began to\r\nfind out that truly Divine mystery, that you had a mother on earth,\r\nsimply by lying soft and warm upon her bosom; and so (as Our Lord told\r\nthe Jews of old) it is by watching the common natural things around you,\r\nand considering the lilies of the field, how they grow, that you will\r\nbegin at least to learn that far Diviner mystery, that you have a Father\r\nin Heaven.  And so you will be delivered (if you will) out of the tyranny\r\nof darkness, and distrust, and fear, into God's free kingdom of light,\r\nand faith, and love; and will be safe from the venom of that tree which\r\nis more deadly than the fabled upas of the East.  Who planted that tree I\r\nknow not, it was planted so long ago: but surely it is none of God's\r\nplanting, neither of the Son of God: yet it grows in all lands and in all\r\nclimes, and sends its hidden suckers far and wide, even (unless we be\r\nwatchful) into your hearts and mine.  And its name is the Tree of\r\nUnreason, whose roots are conceit and ignorance, and its juices folly and\r\ndeath.  It drops its venom into the finest brains; and makes them call\r\nsense, nonsense; and nonsense, sense; fact, fiction; and fiction, fact.\r\nIt drops its venom into the tenderest hearts, alas! and makes them call\r\nwrong, right; and right, wrong; love, cruelty; and cruelty, love.  Some\r\nsay that the axe is laid to the root of it just now, and that it is\r\nalready tottering to its fall: while others say that it is growing\r\nstronger than ever, and ready to spread its upas-shade over the whole\r\nearth.  For my part, I know not, save that all shall be as God wills.  The\r\ntree has been cut down already again and again; and yet has always thrown\r\nout fresh shoots and dropped fresh poison from its boughs.  But this at\r\nleast I know: that any little child, who will use the faculties God has\r\ngiven him, may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb\r\nbeneath his feet.\r\n\r\nThere, you do not understand me, my boys; and the best prayer I can offer\r\nfor you is, perhaps, that you should never need to understand me: but if\r\nthat sore need should come, and that poison should begin to spread its\r\nmist over your brains and hearts, then you will be proof against it; just\r\nin proportion as you have used the eyes and the common sense which God\r\nhas given you, and have considered the lilies of the field, how they\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nC. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I--THE GLEN\r\n\r\n\r\nYou find it dull walking up here upon Hartford Bridge Flat this sad\r\nNovember day?  Well, I do not deny that the moor looks somewhat dreary,\r\nthough dull it need never be.  Though the fog is clinging to the\r\nfir-trees, and creeping among the heather, till you cannot see as far as\r\nMinley Corner, hardly as far as Bramshill woods--and all the Berkshire\r\nhills are as invisible as if it was a dark midnight--yet there is plenty\r\nto be seen here at our very feet.  Though there is nothing left for you\r\nto pick, and all the flowers are dead and brown, except here and there a\r\npoor half-withered scrap of bottle-heath, and nothing left for you to\r\ncatch either, for the butterflies and insects are all dead too, except\r\none poor old Daddy-long-legs, who sits upon that piece of turf, boring a\r\nhole with her tail to lay her eggs in, before the frost catches her and\r\nends her like the rest: though all things, I say, seem dead, yet there is\r\nplenty of life around you, at your feet, I may almost say in the very\r\nstones on which you tread.  And though the place itself be dreary enough,\r\na sheet of flat heather and a little glen in it, with banks of dead fern,\r\nand a brown bog between them, and a few fir-trees struggling up--yet, if\r\nyou only have eyes to see it, that little bit of glen is beautiful and\r\nwonderful,--so beautiful and so wonderful and so cunningly devised, that\r\nit took thousands of years to make it; and it is not, I believe, half\r\nfinished yet.\r\n\r\nHow do I know all that?  Because a fairy told it me; a fairy who lives up\r\nhere upon the moor, and indeed in most places else, if people have but\r\neyes to see her.  What is her name?  I cannot tell.  The best name that I\r\ncan give her (and I think it must be something like her real name,\r\nbecause she will always answer if you call her by it patiently and\r\nreverently) is Madam How.  She will come in good time, if she is called,\r\neven by a little child.  And she will let us see her at her work, and,\r\nwhat is more, teach us to copy her.  But there is another fairy here\r\nlikewise, whom we can hardly hope to see.  Very thankful should we be if\r\nshe lifted even the smallest corner of her veil, and showed us but for a\r\nmoment if it were but her finger tip--so beautiful is she, and yet so\r\nawful too.  But that sight, I believe, would not make us proud, as if we\r\nhad had some great privilege.  No, my dear child: it would make us feel\r\nsmaller, and meaner, and more stupid and more ignorant than we had ever\r\nfelt in our lives before; at the same time it would make us wiser than\r\never we were in our lives before--that one glimpse of the great glory of\r\nher whom we call Lady Why.\r\n\r\nBut I will say more of her presently.  We must talk first with Madam How,\r\nand perhaps she may help us hereafter to see Lady Why.  For she is the\r\nservant, and Lady Why is the mistress; though she has a Master over her\r\nagain--whose name I leave for you to guess.  You have heard it often\r\nalready, and you will hear it again, for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nBut of one thing I must warn you, that you must not confound Madam How\r\nand Lady Why.  Many people do it, and fall into great mistakes\r\nthereby,--mistakes that even a little child, if it would think, need not\r\ncommit.  But really great philosophers sometimes make this mistake about\r\nWhy and How; and therefore it is no wonder if other people make it too,\r\nwhen they write children's books about the wonders of nature, and call\r\nthem \"Why and Because,\" or \"The Reason Why.\"  The books are very good\r\nbooks, and you should read and study them: but they do not tell you\r\nreally \"Why and Because,\" but only \"How and So.\"  They do not tell you\r\nthe \"Reason Why\" things happen, but only \"The Way in which they happen.\"\r\nHowever, I must not blame these good folks, for I have made the same\r\nmistake myself often, and may do it again: but all the more shame to me.\r\nFor see--you know perfectly the difference between How and Why, when you\r\nare talking about yourself.  If I ask you, \"Why did we go out to-day?\"\r\nYou would not answer, \"Because we opened the door.\"  That is the answer\r\nto \"How did we go out?\"  The answer to Why did we go out is, \"Because we\r\nchose to take a walk.\"  Now when we talk about other things beside\r\nourselves, we must remember this same difference between How and Why.  If\r\nI ask you, \"Why does fire burn you?\" you would answer, I suppose, being a\r\nlittle boy, \"Because it is hot;\" which is all you know about it.  But if\r\nyou were a great chemist, instead of a little boy, you would be apt to\r\nanswer me, I am afraid, \"Fire burns because the vibratory motion of the\r\nmolecules of the heated substance communicates itself to the molecules of\r\nmy skin, and so destroys their tissue;\" which is, I dare say, quite true:\r\nbut it only tells us how fire burns, the way or means by which it burns;\r\nit does not tell us the reason why it burns.\r\n\r\nBut you will ask, \"If that is not the reason why fire burns, what is?\"  My\r\ndear child, I do not know.  That is Lady Why's business, who is mistress\r\nof Mrs. How, and of you and of me; and, as I think, of all things that\r\nyou ever saw, or can see, or even dream.  And what her reason for making\r\nfire burn may be I cannot tell.  But I believe on excellent grounds that\r\nher reason is a very good one.  If I dare to guess, I should say that one\r\nreason, at least, why fire burns, is that you may take care not to play\r\nwith it, and so not only scorch your finger, but set your whole bed on\r\nfire, and perhaps the house into the bargain, as you might be tempted to\r\ndo if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting sugar\r\nin your mouth.\r\n\r\nMy dear child, if I could once get clearly into your head this difference\r\nbetween Why and How, so that you should remember them steadily in after\r\nlife, I should have done you more good than if I had given you a thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nBut now that we know that How and Why are two very different matters, and\r\nmust not be confounded with each other, let us look for Madam How, and\r\nsee her at work making this little glen; for, as I told you, it is not\r\nhalf made yet.  One thing we shall see at once, and see it more and more\r\nclearly the older we grow; I mean her wonderful patience and diligence.\r\nMadam How is never idle for an instant.  Nothing is too great or too\r\nsmall for her; and she keeps her work before her eye in the same moment,\r\nand makes every separate bit of it help every other bit.  She will keep\r\nthe sun and stars in order, while she looks after poor old Mrs. Daddy-\r\nlong-legs there and her eggs.  She will spend thousands of years in\r\nbuilding up a mountain, and thousands of years in grinding it down again;\r\nand then carefully polish every grain of sand which falls from that\r\nmountain, and put it in its right place, where it will be wanted\r\nthousands of years hence; and she will take just as much trouble about\r\nthat one grain of sand as she did about the whole mountain.  She will\r\nsettle the exact place where Mrs. Daddy-long-legs shall lay her eggs, at\r\nthe very same time that she is settling what shall happen hundreds of\r\nyears hence in a stair millions of miles away.  And I really believe that\r\nMadam How knows her work so thoroughly, that the grain of sand which\r\nsticks now to your shoe, and the weight of Mrs. Daddy-long-legs' eggs at\r\nthe bottom of her hole, will have an effect upon suns and stars ages\r\nafter you and I are dead and gone.  Most patient indeed is Madam How.  She\r\ndoes not mind the least seeing her own work destroyed; she knows that it\r\nmust be destroyed.  There is a spell upon her, and a fate, that\r\neverything she makes she must unmake again: and yet, good and wise woman\r\nas she is, she never frets, nor tires, nor fudges her work, as we say at\r\nschool.  She takes just as much pains to make an acorn as to make a\r\npeach.  She takes just as much pains about the acorn which the pig eats,\r\nas about the acorn which will grow into a tall oak, and help to build a\r\ngreat ship.  She took just as much pains, again, about the acorn which\r\nyou crushed under your foot just now, and which you fancy will never come\r\nto anything.  Madam How is wiser than that.  She knows that it will come\r\nto something.  She will find some use for it, as she finds a use for\r\neverything.  That acorn which you crushed will turn into mould, and that\r\nmould will go to feed the roots of some plant, perhaps next year, if it\r\nlies where it is; or perhaps it will be washed into the brook, and then\r\ninto the river, and go down to the sea, and will feed the roots of some\r\nplant in some new continent ages and ages hence: and so Madam How will\r\nhave her own again.  You dropped your stick into the river yesterday, and\r\nit floated away.  You were sorry, because it had cost you a great deal of\r\ntrouble to cut it, and peel it, and carve a head and your name on it.\r\nMadam How was not sorry, though she had taken a great deal more trouble\r\nwith that stick than ever you had taken.  She had been three years making\r\nthat stick, out of many things, sunbeams among the rest.  But when it\r\nfell into the river, Madam How knew that she should not lose her sunbeams\r\nnor anything else: the stick would float down the river, and on into the\r\nsea; and there, when it got heavy with the salt water, it would sink, and\r\nlodge, and be buried, and perhaps ages hence turn into coal; and ages\r\nafter that some one would dig it up and burn it, and then out would come,\r\nas bright warm flame, all the sunbeams that were stored away in that\r\nstick: and so Madam How would have her own again.  And if that should not\r\nbe the fate of your stick, still something else will happen to it just as\r\nuseful in the long run; for Madam How never loses anything, but uses up\r\nall her scraps and odds and ends somehow, somewhere, somewhen, as is fit\r\nand proper for the Housekeeper of the whole Universe.  Indeed, Madam How\r\nis so patient that some people fancy her stupid, and think that, because\r\nshe does not fall into a passion every time you steal her sweets, or\r\nbreak her crockery, or disarrange her furniture, therefore she does not\r\ncare.  But I advise you as a little boy, and still more when you grow up\r\nto be a man, not to get that fancy into your head; for you will find\r\nthat, however good-natured and patient Madam How is in most matters, her\r\nkeeping silence and not seeming to see you is no sign that she has\r\nforgotten.  On the contrary, she bears a grudge (if one may so say, with\r\nall respect to her) longer than any one else does; because she will\r\nalways have her own again.  Indeed, I sometimes think that if it were not\r\nfor Lady Why, her mistress, she might bear some of her grudges for ever\r\nand ever.  I have seen men ere now damage some of Madam How's property\r\nwhen they were little boys, and be punished by her all their lives long,\r\neven though she had mended the broken pieces, or turned them to some\r\nother use.  Therefore I say to you, beware of Madam How.  She will teach\r\nyou more kindly, patiently, and tenderly than any mother, if you want to\r\nlearn her trade.  But if, instead of learning her trade, you damage her\r\nmaterials and play with her tools, beware lest she has her own again out\r\nof you.\r\n\r\nSome people think, again, that Madam How is not only stupid, but\r\nill-tempered and cruel; that she makes earthquakes and storms, and famine\r\nand pestilences, in a sort of blind passion, not caring where they go or\r\nwhom they hurt; quite heedless of who is in the way, if she wants to do\r\nanything or go anywhere.  Now, that Madam How can be very terrible there\r\ncan be no doubt: but there is no doubt also that, if people choose to\r\nlearn, she will teach them to get out of her way whenever she has\r\nbusiness to do which is dangerous to them.  But as for her being cruel\r\nand unjust, those may believe it who like.  You, my dear boys and girls,\r\nneed not believe it, if you will only trust to Lady Why; and be sure that\r\nWhy is the mistress and How the servant, now and for ever.  That Lady Why\r\nis utterly good and kind I know full well; and I believe that, in her\r\ncase too, the old proverb holds, \"Like mistress, like servant;\" and that\r\nthe more we know of Madam How, the more we shall be content with her, and\r\nready to submit to whatever she does: but not with that stupid\r\nresignation which some folks preach who do not believe in lady Why--that\r\nis no resignation at all.  That is merely saying--\r\n\r\n   \"What can't be cured\r\n   Must be endured,\"\r\n\r\nlike a donkey when he turns his tail to a hail-storm,--but the true\r\nresignation, the resignation which is fit for grown people and children\r\nalike, the resignation which is the beginning and the end of all wisdom\r\nand all religion, is to believe that Lady Why knows best, because she\r\nherself is perfectly good; and that as she is mistress over Madam How, so\r\nshe has a Master over her, whose name--I say again--I leave you to guess.\r\n\r\nSo now that I have taught you not to be afraid of Madam How, we will go\r\nand watch her at her work; and if we do not understand anything we see,\r\nwe will ask her questions.  She will always show us one of her lesson\r\nbooks if we give her time.  And if we have to wait some time for her\r\nanswer, you need not fear catching cold, though it is November; for she\r\nkeeps her lesson books scattered about in strange places, and we may have\r\nto walk up and down that hill more than once before we can make out how\r\nshe makes the glen.\r\n\r\nWell--how was the glen made?  You shall guess it if you like, and I will\r\nguess too.  You think, perhaps, that an earthquake opened it?\r\n\r\nMy dear child, we must look before we guess.  Then, after we have looked\r\na little, and got some grounds for guessing, then we may guess.  And you\r\nhave no ground for supposing there ever was an earthquake here strong\r\nenough to open that glen.  There may have been one: but we must guess\r\nfrom what we do know, and not from what we do not.\r\n\r\nGuess again.  Perhaps it was there always, from the beginning of the\r\nworld?  My dear child, you have no proof of that either.  Everything\r\nround you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the\r\nlonger you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this\r\nglen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done.\r\nBesides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but that she\r\nwas making it, and as yet has only half finished.  That is my first\r\nguess; and my next guess is that water is making the glen--water, and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nYou open your young eyes.  And I do not blame you.  I looked at this very\r\nglen for fifteen years before I made that guess; and I have looked at it\r\nsome ten years since, to make sure that my guess held good.  For man\r\nafter all is very blind, my dear boy, and very stupid, and cannot see\r\nwhat lies under his own feet all day long; and if Lady Why, and He whom\r\nLady Why obeys, were not very patient and gentle with mankind, they would\r\nhave perished off the face of the earth long ago, simply from their own\r\nstupidity.  I, at least, was very stupid in this case, for I had my head\r\nfull of earthquakes, and convulsions of nature, and all sorts of\r\nprodigies which never happened to this glen; and so, while I was trying\r\nto find what was not there, I of course found nothing.  But when I put\r\nthem all out of my head, and began to look for what was there, I found it\r\nat once; and lo and behold! I had seen it a thousand times before, and\r\nyet never learnt anything from it, like a stupid man as I was; though\r\nwhat I learnt you may learn as easily as I did.\r\n\r\nAnd what did I find?\r\n\r\nThe pond at the bottom of the glen.\r\n\r\nYou know that pond, of course?  You don't need to go there?  Very well.\r\nThen if you do, do not you know also that the pond is always filling up\r\nwith sand and mud; and that though we clean it out every three or four\r\nyears, it always fills again?  Now where does that sand and mud come\r\nfrom?\r\n\r\nDown that stream, of course, which runs out of this bog.  You see it\r\ncoming down every time there is a flood, and the stream fouls.\r\n\r\nVery well.  Then, said Madam How to me, as soon as I recollected that,\r\n\"Don't you see, you stupid man, that the stream has made the glen, and\r\nthe earth which runs down the stream was all once part of the hill on\r\nwhich you stand.\"  I confess I was very much ashamed of myself when she\r\nsaid that.  For that is the history of the whole mystery.  Madam How is\r\ndigging away with her soft spade, water.  She has a harder spade, or\r\nrather plough, the strongest and most terrible of all ploughs; but that,\r\nI am glad to say, she has laid by in England here.\r\n\r\nWater?  But water is too simple a thing to have dug out all this great\r\nglen.\r\n\r\nMy dear child, the most wonderful part of Madam How's work is, that she\r\ndoes such great things and so many different things, with one and the\r\nsame tool, which looks to you so simple, though it really is not so.\r\nWater, for instance, is not a simple thing, but most complicated; and we\r\nmight spend hours in talking about water, without having come to the end\r\nof its wonders.  Still Madam How is a great economist, and never wastes\r\nher materials.  She is like the sailor who boasted (only she never\r\nboasts) that, if he had but a long life and a strong knife, he would\r\nbuild St. Paul's Cathedral before he was done.  And Madam How has a very\r\nlong life, and plenty of time; and one of the strongest of all her tools\r\nis water.  Now if you will stoop down and look into the heather, I will\r\nshow you how she is digging out the glen with this very mist which is\r\nhanging about our feet.  At least, so I guess.\r\n\r\nFor see how the mist clings to the points of the heather leaves, and\r\nmakes drops.  If the hot sun came out the drops would dry, and they would\r\nvanish into the air in light warm steam.  But now that it is dark and\r\ncold they drip, or run down the heather-stems, to the ground.  And\r\nwhither do they go then?  Whither will the water go,--hundreds of gallons\r\nof it perhaps,--which has dripped and run through the heather in this\r\nsingle day?  It will sink into the ground, you know.  And then what will\r\nbecome of it?  Madam How will use it as an underground spade, just as she\r\nuses the rain (at least, when it rains too hard, and therefore the rain\r\nruns off the moor instead of sinking into it) as a spade above ground.\r\n\r\nNow come to the edge of the glen, and I will show you the mist that fell\r\nyesterday, perhaps, coming out of the ground again, and hard at work.\r\n\r\nYou know of what an odd, and indeed of what a pretty form all these glens\r\nare.  How the flat moor ends suddenly in a steep rounded bank, almost\r\nlike the crest of a wave--ready like a wave-crest to fall over, and as\r\nyou know, falling over sometimes, bit by bit, where the soil is bare.\r\n\r\nOh, yes; you are very fond of those banks.  It is \"awfully jolly,\" as you\r\nsay, scrambling up and down them, in the deep heath and fern; besides,\r\nthere are plenty of rabbit-holes there, because they are all sand; while\r\nthere are no rabbit-holes on the flat above, because it is all gravel.\r\n\r\nYes; you know all about it: but you know, too, that you must not go too\r\nfar down these banks, much less roll down them, because there is almost\r\ncertain to be a bog at the bottom, lying upon a gentle slope; and there\r\nyou get wet through.\r\n\r\nAll round these hills, from here to Aldershot in one direction, and from\r\nhere to Windsor in another, you see the same shaped glens; the wave-crest\r\nalong their top, and at the foot of the crest a line of springs which run\r\nout over the slopes, or well up through them in deep sand-galls, as you\r\ncall them--shaking quagmires which are sometimes deep enough to swallow\r\nup a horse, and which you love to dance upon in summer time.  Now the\r\nwater of all these springs is nothing but the rain, and mist, and dew,\r\nwhich has sunk down first through the peaty soil, and then through the\r\ngravel and sand, and there has stopped.  And why?  Because under the\r\ngravel (about which I will tell you a strange story one day) and under\r\nthe sand, which is what the geologists call the Upper Bagshot sand, there\r\nis an entirely different set of beds, which geologists call the\r\nBracklesham beds, from a place near the New Forest; and in those beds\r\nthere is a vein of clay, and through that clay the water cannot get, as\r\nyou have seen yourself when we dug it out in the field below to puddle\r\nthe pond-head; and very good fun you thought it, and a very pretty mess\r\nyou made of yourself.  Well: because the water cannot get though this\r\nclay, and must go somewhere, it runs out continually along the top of the\r\nclay, and as it runs undermines the bank, and brings down sand and gravel\r\ncontinually for the next shower to wash into the stream below.\r\n\r\nNow think for one moment how wonderful it is that the shape of these\r\nglens, of which you are so fond, was settled by the particular order in\r\nwhich Madam How laid down the gravel and sand and mud at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, ages and ages ago.  This is what I told you, that the least\r\nthing that Madam How does to-day may take effect hundreds and thousands\r\nof years hence.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you I think there was a time when this glen was of a very\r\ndifferent shape from what it is now; and I dare say, according to your\r\nnotions, of a much prettier shape.  It was once just like one of those\r\nChines which we used to see at Bournemouth.  You recollect them?  How\r\nthere was a narrow gap in the cliff of striped sands and gravels; and out\r\nof the mouth of that gap, only a few feet across, there poured down a\r\ngreat slope of mud and sand the shape of half a bun, some wet and some\r\ndry, up which we used to scramble and get into the Chine, and call the\r\nChine what it was in the truest sense, Fairyland.  You recollect how it\r\nwas all eaten out into mountain ranges, pinnacles, steep cliffs of white,\r\nand yellow, and pink, standing up against the clear blue sky; till we\r\nagreed that, putting aside the difference of size, they were as beautiful\r\nand grand as any Alps we had ever seen in pictures.  And how we saw (for\r\nthere could be no mistake about it there) that the Chine was being\r\nhollowed out by the springs which broke out high up the cliff, and by the\r\nrain which wore the sand into furrowed pinnacles and peaks.  You\r\nrecollect the beautiful place, and how, when we looked back down it we\r\nsaw between the miniature mountain walls the bright blue sea, and heard\r\nit murmur on the sands outside.  So I verily believe we might have done,\r\nif we had stood somewhere at the bottom of this glen thousands of years\r\nago.  We should have seen the sea in front of us; or rather, an arm of\r\nthe sea; for Finchampstead ridges opposite, instead of being covered with\r\nfarms, and woodlands, and purple heath above, would have been steep\r\ncliffs of sand and clay, just like those you see at Bournemouth now;\r\nand--what would have spoilt somewhat the beauty of the sight--along the\r\nshores there would have floated, at least in winter, great blocks and\r\nfloes of ice, such as you might have seen in the tideway at King's Lynn\r\nthe winter before last, growling and crashing, grubbing and ploughing the\r\nsand, and the gravel, and the mud, and sweeping them away into seas\r\ntowards the North, which are now all fruitful land.  That may seem to you\r\nlike a dream: yet it is true; and some day, when we have another talk\r\nwith Madam How, I will show even a child like you that it was true.\r\n\r\nBut what could change a beautiful Chine like that at Bournemouth into a\r\nwide sloping glen like this of Bracknell's Bottom, with a wood like\r\nCoombs', many acres large, in the middle of it?  Well now, think.  It is\r\na capital plan for finding out Madam How's secrets, to see what she might\r\ndo in one place, and explain by it what she has done in another.  Suppose\r\nnow, Madam How had orders to lift up the whole coast of Bournemouth only\r\ntwenty or even ten feet higher out of the sea than it is now.  She could\r\ndo that easily enough, for she has been doing so on the coast of South\r\nAmerica for ages; she has been doing so this very summer in what hasty\r\npeople would call a hasty, and violent, and ruthless way; though I shall\r\nnot say so, for I believe that Lady Why knows best.  She is doing so now\r\nsteadily on the west coast of Norway, which is rising quietly--all that\r\nvast range of mountain wall and iron-bound cliff--at the rate of some\r\nfour feet in a hundred years, without making the least noise or\r\nconfusion, or even causing an extra ripple on the sea; so light and\r\ngentle, when she will, can Madam How's strong finger be.\r\n\r\nNow, if the mouth of that Chine at Bournemouth was lifted twenty feet out\r\nof the sea, one thing would happen,--that the high tide would not come up\r\nany longer, and wash away the cake of dirt at the entrance, as we saw it\r\ndo so often.  But if the mud stopped there, the mud behind it would come\r\ndown more slowly, and lodge inside more and more, till the Chine was half\r\nfilled-up, and only the upper part of the cliffs continue to be eaten\r\naway, above the level where the springs ran out.  So gradually the Chine,\r\ninstead of being deep and narrow, would become broad and shallow; and\r\ninstead of hollowing itself rapidly after every shower of rain, as you\r\nsaw the Chine at Bournemouth doing, would hollow itself out slowly, as\r\nthis glen is doing now.  And one thing more would happen,--when the sea\r\nceased to gnaw at the foot of the cliffs outside, and to carry away every\r\nstone and grain of sand which fell from them, the cliffs would very soon\r\ncease to be cliffs; the rain and the frost would still crumble them down,\r\nbut the dirt that fell would lie at their feet, and gradually make a\r\nslope of dry land, far out where the shallow sea had been; and their\r\ntops, instead of being steep as now, would become smooth and rounded; and\r\nso at last, instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the Chine's mouth, you\r\nmight have--just what you have here at the mouth of this glen,--our Mount\r\nand the Warren Hill,--long slopes with sheets of drifted gravel and sand\r\nat their feet, stretching down into what was once an icy sea, and is now\r\nthe Vale of Blackwater.  And this I really believe Madam How has done\r\nsimply by lifting Hartford Bridge Flat a few more feet out of the sea,\r\nand leaving the rest to her trusty tool, the water in the sky.\r\n\r\nThat is my guess: and I think it is a good guess, because I have asked\r\nMadam How a hundred different questions about it in the last ten years,\r\nand she always answered them in the same way, saying, \"Water, water, you\r\nstupid man.\"  But I do not want you merely to depend on what I say.  If\r\nyou want to understand Madam How, you must ask her questions yourself,\r\nand make up your mind yourself like a man, instead of taking things at\r\nhearsay or second-hand, like the vulgar.  Mind, by \"the vulgar\" I do not\r\nmean poor people: I mean ignorant and uneducated people, who do not use\r\ntheir brains rightly, though they may be fine ladies, kings, or popes.\r\nThe Bible says, \"Prove all things: hold fast that which is good.\"  So do\r\nyou prove my guess, and if it proves good, hold it fast.\r\n\r\nAnd how can I do that?\r\n\r\nFirst, by direct experiment, as it is called.  In plain English--go home\r\nand make a little Hartford Bridge Flat in the stable-yard; and then ask\r\nMrs. How if she will not make a glen in it like this glen here.  We will\r\ngo home and try that.  We will make a great flat cake of clay, and put\r\nupon it a cap of sand; and then we will rain upon it out of a watering-\r\npot; and see if Mrs. How does not begin soon to make a glen in the side\r\nof the heap, just like those on Hartford Bridge Flat.  I believe she\r\nwill; and certainly, if she does, it will be a fresh proof that my guess\r\nis right.  And then we will see whether water will not make glens of a\r\ndifferent shape than these, if it run over soils of a different kind.  We\r\nwill make a Hartford Bridge Flat turned upside down--a cake of sand with\r\na cap of clay on the top; and we will rain on that out of our watering-\r\npot, and see what sort of glens we make then.  I can guess what they will\r\nbe like, because I have seen them--steep overhanging cliffs, with very\r\nnarrow gullies down them: but you shall try for yourself, and make up\r\nyour mind whether you think me right or wrong.  Meanwhile, remember that\r\nthose gullies too will have been made by water.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another way of \"verifying my theory,\" as it is called; in\r\nplain English, seeing if my guess holds good; that is, to look at other\r\nvalleys--not merely the valleys round here, but valleys in clay, in\r\nchalk, in limestone, in the hard slate rock such as you saw in\r\nDevonshire--and see whether my guess does not hold good about them too;\r\nwhether all of them, deep or shallow, broad or narrow, rock or earth, may\r\nnot have been all hollowed out by running water.  I am sure if you would\r\ndo this you would find something to amuse you, and something to instruct\r\nyou, whenever you wish.  I know that I do.  To me the longest railroad\r\njourney, instead of being stupid, is like continually turning over the\r\nleaves of a wonderful book, or looking at wonderful pictures of old\r\nworlds which were made and unmade thousands of years ago.  For I keep\r\nlooking, not only at the railway cuttings, where the bones of the old\r\nworlds are laid bare, but at the surface of the ground; at the plains and\r\ndowns, banks and knolls, hills and mountains; and continually asking Mrs.\r\nHow what gave them each its shape: and I will soon teach you to do the\r\nsame.  When you do, I tell you fairly her answer will be in almost every\r\ncase, \"Running water.\"  Either water running when soft, as it usually is;\r\nor water running when it is hard--in plain words, moving ice.\r\n\r\nAbout that moving ice, which is Mrs. How's stronger spade, I will tell\r\nyou some other time; and show you, too, the marks of it in every gravel\r\npit about here.  But now, I see, you want to ask a question; and what is\r\nit?\r\n\r\nDo I mean to say that water has made great valleys, such as you have seen\r\npaintings and photographs of,--valleys thousands of feet deep, among\r\nmountains thousands of feet high?\r\n\r\nYes, I do.  But, as I said before, I do not like you to take my word upon\r\ntrust.  When you are older you shall go to the mountains, and you shall\r\njudge for yourself.  Still, I must say that I never saw a valley, however\r\ndeep, or a cliff, however high, which had not been scooped out by water;\r\nand that even the mountain-tops which stand up miles aloft in jagged\r\npeaks and pinnacles against the sky were cut out at first, and are being\r\ncut and sharpened still, by little else save water, soft and hard; that\r\nis, by rain, frost, and ice.\r\n\r\nWater, and nothing else, has sawn out such a chasm as that through which\r\nthe ships run up to Bristol, between Leigh Wood and St. Vincent's Rocks.\r\nWater, and nothing else, has shaped those peaks of the Matterhorn, or the\r\nWeisshorn, or the Pic du Midi of the Pyrenees, of which you have seen\r\nsketches and photographs.  Just so water might saw out Hartford Bridge\r\nFlat, if it had time enough, into a labyrinth of valleys, and hills, and\r\npeaks standing alone; as it has done already by Ambarrow, and Edgbarrow,\r\nand the Folly Hill on the other side of the vale.\r\n\r\nI see you are astonished at the notion that water can make Alps.  But it\r\nwas just because I knew you would be astonished at Madam How's doing so\r\ngreat a thing with so simple a tool, that I began by showing you how she\r\nwas doing the same thing in a small way here upon these flats.  For the\r\nsafest way to learn Madam How's methods is to watch her at work in little\r\ncorners at commonplace business, which will not astonish or frighten us,\r\nnor put huge hasty guesses and dreams into our heads.  Sir Isaac Newton,\r\nsome will tell you, found out the great law of gravitation, which holds\r\ntrue of all the suns and stars in heaven, by watching an apple fall: and\r\neven if he did not find it out so, he found it out, we know, by careful\r\nthinking over the plain and commonplace fact, that things have weight.  So\r\ndo you be humble and patient, and watch Madam How at work on little\r\nthings.  For that is the way to see her at work upon all space and time.\r\n\r\nWhat? you have a question more to ask?\r\n\r\nOh!  I talked about Madam How lifting up Hartford Bridge Flat.  How could\r\nshe do that?  My dear child, that is a long story, and I must tell it you\r\nsome other time.  Meanwhile, did you ever see the lid of a kettle rise up\r\nand shake when the water inside boiled?  Of course; and of course, too,\r\nremember that Madam How must have done it.  Then think over between this\r\nand our next talk, what that can possibly have to do with her lifting up\r\nHartford Bridge Flat.  But you have been longing, perhaps, all this time\r\nto hear more about Lady Why, and why she set Madam How to make\r\nBracknell's Bottom.\r\n\r\nMy dear child, the only answer I dare give to that is: Whatever other\r\npurposes she may have made it for, she made it at least for this--that\r\nyou and I should come to it this day, and look at, and talk over it, and\r\nbecome thereby wiser and more earnest, and we will hope more humble and\r\nbetter people.  Whatever else Lady Why may wish or not wish, this she\r\nwishes always, to make all men wise and all men good.  For what is\r\nwritten of her whom, as in a parable, I have called Lady Why?\r\n\r\n\"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before His works of\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\"When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no\r\nfountains abounding with water.\r\n\r\n\"Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:\r\n\r\n\"While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest\r\npart of the dust of the world.\r\n\r\n\"When He prepared the heavens, I was there: when He set a compass upon\r\nthe face of the depth:\r\n\r\n\"When He established the clouds above: when He strengthened the fountains\r\nof the deep:\r\n\r\n\"When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not pass His\r\ncommandment: when He appointed the foundations of the earth:\r\n\r\n\"Then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him: and I was daily His\r\ndelight, rejoicing always before Him:\r\n\r\n\"Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth; and my delights were with\r\nthe sons of men.\r\n\r\n\"Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that\r\nkeep my ways.\"\r\n\r\nThat we can say, for it has been said for us already.  But beyond that we\r\ncan say, and need say, very little.  We were not there, as we read in the\r\nBook of Job, when God laid the foundations of the earth.  \"We see,\" says\r\nSt. Paul, \"as in a glass darkly, and only know in part.\"  \"For who,\" he\r\nasks again, \"has known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His\r\ncounsellor? . . . For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all\r\nthings: to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.\"  Therefore we must\r\nnot rashly say, this or that is Why a thing has happened; nor invent what\r\nare called \"final causes,\" which are not Lady Why herself, but only our\r\nlittle notions of what Lady Why has done, or rather what we should have\r\ndone if we had been in her place.  It is not, indeed, by thinking that we\r\nshall find out anything about Lady Why.  She speaks not to our eyes or to\r\nour brains, like Madam How, but to that inner part of us which we call\r\nour hearts and spirits, and which will endure when eyes and brain are\r\nturned again to dust.  If your heart be pure and sober, gentle and\r\ntruthful, then Lady Why speaks to you without words, and tells you things\r\nwhich Madam How and all her pupils, the men of science, can never tell.\r\nWhen you lie, it may be, on a painful sick-bed, but with your mother's\r\nhand in yours; when you sit by her, looking up into her loving eyes; when\r\nyou gaze out towards the setting sun, and fancy golden capes and islands\r\nin the clouds, and seas and lakes in the blue sky, and the infinite rest\r\nand peace of the far west sends rest and peace into your young heart,\r\ntill you sit silent and happy, you know not why; when sweet music fills\r\nyour heart with noble and tender instincts which need no thoughts or\r\nwords; ay, even when you watch the raging thunderstorm, and feel it to\r\nbe, in spite of its great awfulness, so beautiful that you cannot turn\r\nyour eyes away: at such times as these Lady Why is speaking to your soul\r\nof souls, and saying, \"My child, this world is a new place, and strange,\r\nand often terrible: but be not afraid.  All will come right at last.  Rest\r\nwill conquer Restlessness; Faith will conquer Fear; Order will conquer\r\nDisorder; Health will conquer Sickness; Joy will conquer Sorrow; Pleasure\r\nwill conquer Pain; Life will conquer Death; Right will conquer Wrong.  All\r\nwill be well at last.  Keep your soul and body pure, humble, busy,\r\npious--in one word, be good: and ere you die, or after you die, you may\r\nhave some glimpse of Me, the Everlasting Why: and hear with the ears, not\r\nof your body but of your spirit, men and all rational beings, plants and\r\nanimals, ay, the very stones beneath your feet, the clouds above your\r\nhead, the planets and the suns away in farthest space, singing eternally,\r\n\r\n\"'Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power, for\r\nThou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were\r\ncreated.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nSo?  You have been looking at that beautiful drawing of the ruin of Arica\r\nin the _Illustrated London News_: and it has puzzled you and made you\r\nsad.  You want to know why God killed all those people--mothers among\r\nthem, too, and little children?\r\n\r\nAlas, my dear child! who am I that I should answer you that?\r\n\r\nHave you done wrong in asking me?  No, my dear child; no.  You have asked\r\nme because you are a human being and a child of God, and not merely a\r\ncleverer sort of animal, an ape who can read and write and cast accounts.\r\nTherefore it is that you cannot be content, and ought not to be content,\r\nwith asking how things happen, but must go on to ask why.  You cannot be\r\ncontent with knowing the causes of things; and if you knew all the\r\nnatural science that ever was or ever will be known to men, that would\r\nnot satisfy you; for it would only tell you the _causes_ of things, while\r\nyour souls want to know the _reasons_ of things besides; and though I may\r\nnot be able to tell you the reasons of things, or show you aught but a\r\ntiny glimpse here and there of that which I called the other day the\r\nglory of Lady Why, yet I believe that somehow, somewhen, somewhere, you\r\nwill learn something of the reason of things.  For that thirst to know\r\n_why_ was put into the hearts of little children by God Himself; and I\r\nbelieve that God would never have given them that thirst if He had not\r\nmeant to satisfy it.\r\n\r\nThere--you do not understand me.  I trust that you will understand me\r\nsome day.  Meanwhile, I think--I only say I _think_--you know I told you\r\nhow humble we must be whenever we speak of Lady Why--that we may guess at\r\nsomething like a good reason for the terrible earthquakes in South\r\nAmerica.  I do not wish to be hard upon poor people in great affliction:\r\nbut I cannot help thinking that they have been doing for hundreds of\r\nyears past something very like what the Bible calls \"tempting\r\nGod\"--staking their property and their lives upon the chances of no\r\nearthquakes coming, while they ought to have known that an earthquake\r\nmight come any day.  They have fulfilled (and little thought I that it\r\nwould be fulfilled so soon) the parable that I told you once, of the\r\nnation of the Do-as-you-likes, who lived careless and happy at the foot\r\nof the burning mountain, and would not be warned by the smoke that came\r\nout of the top, or by the slag and cinders which lay all about them; till\r\nthe mountain blew up, and destroyed them miserably.\r\n\r\nThen I think that they ought to have expected an earthquake.\r\n\r\nWell--it is not for us to judge any one, especially if they live in a\r\npart of the world in which we have not been ourselves.  But I think that\r\nwe know, and that they ought to have known, enough about earthquakes to\r\nhave been more prudent than they have been for many a year.  At least we\r\nwill hope that, though they would not learn their lesson till this year,\r\nthey will learn it now, and will listen to the message which I think\r\nMadam How has brought them, spoken in a voice of thunder, and written in\r\nletters of flame.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that?\r\n\r\nMy dear child, if the landlord of our house was in the habit of pulling\r\nthe roof down upon our heads, and putting gunpowder under the foundations\r\nto blow us up, do you not think we should know what he meant, even though\r\nhe never spoke a word?  He would be very wrong in behaving so, of course:\r\nbut one thing would be certain,--that he did not intend us to live in his\r\nhouse any longer if he could help it; and was giving us, in a very rough\r\nfashion, notice to quit.  And so it seems to me that these poor Spanish\r\nAmericans have received from the Landlord of all landlords, who can do no\r\nwrong, such a notice to quit as perhaps no people ever had before; which\r\nsays to them in unmistakable words, \"You must leave this country: or\r\nperish.\"  And I believe that that message, like all Lady Why's messages,\r\nis at heart a merciful and loving one; that if these Spaniards would\r\nleave the western coast of Peru, and cross the Andes into the green\r\nforests of the eastern side of their own land, they might not only live\r\nfree from earthquakes, but (if they would only be good and industrious)\r\nbecome a great, rich, and happy nation, instead of the idle, and useless,\r\nand I am afraid not over good, people which they have been.  For in that\r\neastern part of their own land God's gifts are waiting for them, in a\r\nparadise such as I can neither describe nor you conceive;--precious\r\nwoods, fruits, drugs, and what not--boundless wealth, in one word--waiting\r\nfor them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river Amazon,\r\nenriching us here in the Old World, and enriching themselves there in the\r\nNew.  If they would only go and use these gifts of God, instead of\r\nneglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years, they\r\nwould be a blessing to the earth, instead of being--that which they have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nGod grant, my dear child, that these poor people may take the warning\r\nthat has been sent to them; \"The voice of God revealed in facts,\" as the\r\ngreat Lord Bacon would have called it, and see not only that God has\r\nbidden them leave the place where they are now, but has prepared for\r\nthem, in their own land, a home a thousand times better than that in\r\nwhich they now live.\r\n\r\nBut you ask, How ought they to have known that an earthquake would come?\r\n\r\nWell, to make you understand that, we must talk a little about\r\nearthquakes, and what makes them; and in order to find out that, let us\r\ntry the very simplest cause of which we can think.  That is the wise and\r\nscientific plan.\r\n\r\nNow, whatever makes these earthquakes must be enormously strong; that is\r\ncertain.  And what is the strongest thing you know of in the world?  Think\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nGunpowder?\r\n\r\nWell, gunpowder is strong sometimes: but not always.  You may carry it in\r\na flask, or in your hand, and then it is weak enough.  It only becomes\r\nstrong by being turned into gas and steam.  But steam is always strong.\r\nAnd if you look at a railway engine, still more if you had ever\r\nseen--which God forbid you should--a boiler explosion, you would agree\r\nwith me, that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam.\r\n\r\nNow I think that we can explain almost, if not quite, all that we know\r\nabout earthquakes, if we believe that on the whole they are caused by\r\nsteam and other gases expanding, that is, spreading out, with wonderful\r\nquickness and strength.  Of course there must be something to make them\r\nexpand, and that is _heat_.  But we will not talk of that yet.\r\n\r\nNow do you remember that riddle which I put to you the other day?--\"What\r\nhad the rattling of the lid of the kettle to do with Hartford Bridge Flat\r\nbeing lifted out of the ancient sea?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to the riddle, I believe, is--Steam has done both.  The lid of\r\nthe kettle rattles, because the expanding steam escapes in little jets,\r\nand so causes a _lid-quake_.  Now suppose that there was steam under the\r\nearth trying to escape, and the earth in one place was loose and yet\r\nhard, as the lid of the kettle is loose and yet hard, with cracks in it,\r\nit may be, like the crack between the edge of the lid and the edge of the\r\nkettle itself: might not the steam try to escape through the cracks, and\r\nrattle the surface of the earth, and so cause an _earthquake_?\r\n\r\nSo the steam would escape generally easily, and would only make a passing\r\nrattle, like the earthquake of which the famous jester Charles Selwyn\r\nsaid that it was quite a young one, so tame that you might have stroked\r\nit; like that which I myself once felt in the Pyrenees, which gave me\r\nvery solemn thoughts after a while, though at first I did nothing but\r\nlaugh at it; and I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nI was travelling in the Pyrenees; and I came one evening to the loveliest\r\nspot--a glen, or rather a vast crack in the mountains, so narrow that\r\nthere was no room for anything at the bottom of it, save a torrent\r\nroaring between walls of polished rock.  High above the torrent the road\r\nwas cut out among the cliffs, and above the road rose more cliffs, with\r\ngreat black cavern mouths, hundreds of feet above our heads, out of each\r\nof which poured in foaming waterfalls streams large enough to turn a\r\nmill, and above them mountains piled on mountains, all covered with woods\r\nof box, which smelt rich and hot and musky in the warm spring air.  Among\r\nthe box-trees and fallen boulders grew hepaticas, blue and white and red,\r\nsuch as you see in the garden; and little stars of gentian, more azure\r\nthan the azure sky.  But out of the box-woods above rose giant silver\r\nfirs, clothing the cliffs and glens with tall black spires, till they\r\nstood out at last in a jagged saw-edge against the purple evening sky,\r\nalong the mountain ranges, thousands of feet aloft; and beyond them\r\nagain, at the head of the valley, rose vast cones of virgin snow, miles\r\naway in reality, but looking so brilliant and so near that one fancied at\r\nthe first moment that one could have touched them with one's hand.  Snow-\r\nwhite they stood, the glorious things, seven thousand feet into the air;\r\nand I watched their beautiful white sides turn rose-colour in the evening\r\nsun, and when he set, fade into dull cold gray, till the bright moon came\r\nout to light them up once more.  When I was tired of wondering and\r\nadmiring, I went into bed; and there I had a dream--such a dream as Alice\r\nhad when she went into Wonderland--such a dream as I dare say you may\r\nhave had ere now.  Some noise or stir puts into your fancy as you sleep a\r\nwhole long dream to account for it; and yet that dream, which seems to\r\nyou to be hours long, has not taken up a second of time; for the very\r\nsame noise which begins the dream, wakes you at the end of it: and so it\r\nwas with me.  I dreamed that some English people had come into the hotel\r\nwhere I was, and were sleeping in the room underneath me; and that they\r\nhad quarrelled and fought, and broke their bed down with a tremendous\r\ncrash, and that I must get up, and stop the fight; and at that moment I\r\nwoke and heard coming up the valley from the north such a roar as I never\r\nheard before or since; as if a hundred railway trains were rolling\r\nunderground; and just as it passed under my bed there was a tremendous\r\nthump, and I jumped out of bed quicker than I ever did in my life, and\r\nheard the roaring sound die away as it rolled up the valley towards the\r\npeaks of snow.  Still I had in my head this notion of the Englishmen\r\nfighting in the room below.  But then I recollected that no Englishmen\r\nhad come in the night before, and that I had been in the room below, and\r\nthat there was no bed in it.  Then I opened my window--a woman screamed,\r\na dog barked, some cocks and hens cackled in a very disturbed humour, and\r\nthen I could hear nothing but the roaring of the torrent a hundred feet\r\nbelow.  And then it flashed across me what all the noise was about; and I\r\nburst out laughing and said \"It is only an earthquake,\" and went to bed\r\n\r\nNext morning I inquired whether any one had heard a noise.  No, nobody\r\nhad heard anything.  And the driver who had brought me up the valley only\r\nwinked, but did not choose to speak.  At last at breakfast I asked the\r\npretty little maid who waited what was the meaning of the noise I heard\r\nin the night, and she answered, to my intense amusement, \"Ah! bah! ce\r\nn'etait qu'un tremblement de terre; il y en a ici toutes les six\r\nsemaines.\"  Now the secret was out.  The little maid, I found, came from\r\nthe lowland far away, and did not mind telling the truth: but the good\r\npeople of the place were afraid to let out that they had earthquakes\r\nevery six weeks, for fear of frightening visitors away: and because they\r\nwere really very good people, and very kind to me, I shall not tell you\r\nwhat the name of the place is.\r\n\r\nOf course after that I could do no less than ask Madam How, very civilly,\r\nhow she made earthquakes in that particular place, hundreds of miles away\r\nfrom any burning mountain?  And this was the answer I _thought_ she gave,\r\nthough I am not so conceited as to say I am sure.\r\n\r\nAs I had come up the valley I had seen that the cliffs were all beautiful\r\ngray limestone marble; but just at this place they were replaced by\r\ngranite, such as you may see in London Bridge or at Aberdeen.  I do not\r\nmean that the limestone changed to granite, but that the granite had\r\nrisen up out of the bottom of the valley, and had carried the limestone\r\n(I suppose) up on its back hundreds of feet into the air.  Those caves\r\nwith the waterfalls pouring from their mouths were all on one level, at\r\nthe top of the granite, and the bottom of the limestone.  That was to be\r\nexpected; for, as I will explain to you some day, water can make caves\r\neasily in limestone: but never, I think, in granite.  But I knew that\r\nbesides these cold springs which came out of the caves, there were hot\r\nsprings also, full of curious chemical salts, just below the very house\r\nwhere I was in.  And when I went to look at them, I found that they came\r\nout of the rock just where the limestone and the granite joined.  \"Ah,\" I\r\nsaid, \"now I think I have Madam How's answer.  The lid of one of her\r\ngreat steam boilers is rather shaky and cracked just here, because the\r\ngranite has broken and torn the limestone as it lifted it up; and here is\r\nthe hot water out of the boiler actually oozing out of the crack; and the\r\nearthquake I heard last night was simply the steam rumbling and thumping\r\ninside, and trying to get out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, my dear child, I fell into a more serious mood.  I said to\r\nmyself, \"If that stream had been a little, only a little stronger, or if\r\nthe rock above it had been only a little weaker, it would have been no\r\nlaughing matter then; the village might have been shaken to the ground;\r\nthe rocks hurled into the torrent; jets of steam and of hot water, mixed,\r\nit may be, with deadly gases, have roared out of the riven ground; that\r\nmight have happened here, in short, which has happened and happens still\r\nin a hundred places in the world, whenever the rocks are too weak to\r\nstand the pressure of the steam below, and the solid earth bursts as an\r\nengine boiler bursts when the steam within it is too strong.\"  And when\r\nthose thoughts came into my mind, I was in no humour to jest any more\r\nabout \"young earthquakes,\" or \"Madam How's boilers;\" but rather to say\r\nwith the wise man of old, \"It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not\r\nconsumed.\"\r\n\r\nMost strange, most terrible also, are the tricks which this underground\r\nsteam plays.  It will make the ground, which seems to us so hard and\r\nfirm, roll and rock in waves, till people are sea-sick, as on board a\r\nship; and that rocking motion (which is the most common) will often, when\r\nit is but slight, set the bells ringing in the steeples, or make the\r\nfurniture, and things on shelves, jump about quaintly enough.  It will\r\nmake trees bend to and fro, as if a wind was blowing through them; open\r\ndoors suddenly, and shut them again with a slam; make the timbers of the\r\nfloors and roofs creak, as they do in a ship at sea; or give men such\r\nfrights as one of the dock-keepers at Liverpool got in the earthquake in\r\n1863, when his watchbox rocked so, that he thought some one was going to\r\npitch him over into the dock.  But these are only little hints and\r\nwarnings of what it can do.  When it is strong enough, it will rock down\r\nhouses and churches into heaps of ruins, or, if it leaves them standing,\r\ncrack them from top to bottom, so that they must be pulled down and\r\nrebuilt.\r\n\r\nYou saw those pictures of the ruins of Arica, about which our talk began;\r\nand from them you can guess well enough for yourself what a town looks\r\nlike which has been ruined by an earthquake.  Of the misery and the\r\nhorror which follow such a ruin I will not talk to you, nor darken your\r\nyoung spirit with sad thoughts which grown people must face, and ought to\r\nface.  But the strangeness of some of the tricks which the earthquake\r\nshocks play is hardly to be explained, even by scientific men.  Sometimes,\r\nit would seem, the force runs round, making the solid ground eddy, as\r\nwater eddies in a brook.  For it will make straight rows of trees\r\ncrooked; it will twist whole walls round--or rather the ground on which\r\nthe walls stand--without throwing them down; it will shift the stones of\r\na pillar one on the other sideways, as if a giant had been trying to spin\r\nit like a teetotum, and so screwed it half in pieces.  There is a story\r\ntold by a wise man, who saw the place himself, of the whole furniture of\r\none house being hurled away by an earthquake, and buried under the ruins\r\nof another house; and of things carried hundreds of yards off, so that\r\nthe neighbours went to law to settle who was the true owner of them.\r\nSometimes, again, the shock seems to come neither horizontally in waves,\r\nnor circularly in eddies, but vertically, that is, straight up from\r\nbelow; and then things--and people, alas! sometimes--are thrown up off\r\nthe earth high into the air, just as things spring up off the table if\r\nyou strike it smartly enough underneath.  By that same law (for there is\r\na law for every sort of motion) it is that the earthquake shock sometimes\r\nhurls great rocks off a cliff into the valley below.  The shock runs\r\nthrough the mountain till it comes to the cliff at the end of it; and\r\nthen the face of the cliff, if it be at all loose, flies off into the\r\nair.  You may see the very same thing happen, if you will put marbles or\r\nbilliard-balls in a row touching each other, and strike the one nearest\r\nyou smartly in the line of the row.  All the balls stand still, except\r\nthe last one, and that flies off.  The shock, like the earthquake shock,\r\nhas run through them all; but only the end one, which had nothing beyond\r\nit but soft air, has been moved; and when you grow old, and learn\r\nmathematics, you will know the law of motion according to which that\r\nhappens, and learn to apply what the billiard-balls have taught you, to\r\nexplain the wonders of an earthquake.  For in this case, as in so many\r\nmore, you must watch Madam How at work on little and common things, to\r\nfind out how she works in great and rare ones.  That is why Solomon says\r\nthat \"a fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth,\" because he is always\r\nlooking out for strange things which he has not seen, and which he could\r\nnot understand if he saw; instead of looking at the petty commonplace\r\nmatters which are about his feet all day long, and getting from them\r\nsound knowledge, and the art of getting more sound knowledge still.\r\n\r\nAnother terrible destruction which the earthquake brings, when it is\r\nclose to the seaside, is the wash of a great sea wave, such as swept in\r\nlast year upon the island of St. Thomas, in the West Indies; such as\r\nswept in upon the coast of Peru this year.  The sea moans, and sinks\r\nback, leaving the shore dry; and then comes in from the offing a mighty\r\nwall of water, as high as, or higher than, many a tall house; sweeps far\r\ninland, washing away quays and houses, and carrying great ships in with\r\nit; and then sweeps back again, leaving the ships high and dry, as ships\r\nwere left in Peru this year.\r\n\r\nNow, how is that wave made?  Let us think.  Perhaps in many ways.  But\r\ntwo of them I will tell you as simply as I can, because they seem the\r\nmost likely, and probably the most common.\r\n\r\nSuppose, as the earthquake shock ran on, making the earth under the sea\r\nheave and fall in long earth-waves, the sea-bottom sank down.  Then the\r\nwater on it would sink down too, and leave the shore dry; till the sea-\r\nbottom rose again, and hurled the water up again against the land.  This\r\nis one way of explaining it, and it may be true.  For certain it is, that\r\nearthquakes do move the bottom of the sea; and certain, too, that they\r\nmove the water of the sea also, and with tremendous force.  For ships at\r\nsea during an earthquake feel such a blow from it (though it does them no\r\nharm) that the sailors often rush upon deck fancying that they have\r\nstruck upon a rock; and the force which could give a ship, floating in\r\nwater, such a blow as that, would be strong enough to hurl thousands of\r\ntons of water up the beach, and on to the land.\r\n\r\nBut there is another way of accounting for this great sea wave, which I\r\nfancy comes true sometimes.\r\n\r\nSuppose you put an empty india-rubber ball into water, and then blow into\r\nit through a pipe.  Of course, you know, as the ball filled, the upper\r\nside of it would rise out of the water.  Now, suppose there were a party\r\nof little ants moving about upon that ball, and fancying it a great\r\nisland, or perhaps the whole world--what would they think of the ball's\r\nfilling and growing bigger?\r\n\r\nIf they could see the sides of the basin or tub in which the ball was,\r\nand were sure that they did not move, then they would soon judge by them\r\nthat they themselves were moving, and that the ball was rising out of the\r\nwater.  But if the ants were so short-sighted that they could not see the\r\nsides of the basin, they would be apt to make a mistake, because they\r\nwould then be like men on an island out of sight of any other land.  Then\r\nit would be impossible further to tell whether they were moving up, or\r\nwhether the water was moving down; whether their ball was rising out of\r\nthe water, or the water was sinking away from the ball.  They would\r\nprobably say, \"The water is sinking and leaving the ball dry.\"\r\n\r\nDo you understand that?  Then think what would happen if you pricked a\r\nhole in the ball.  The air inside would come hissing out, and the ball\r\nwould sink again into the water.  But the ants would probably fancy the\r\nvery opposite.  Their little heads would be full of the notion that the\r\nball was solid and could not move, just as our heads are full of the\r\nnotion that the earth is solid and cannot move; and they would say, \"Ah!\r\nhere is the water rising again.\"  Just so, I believe, when the sea seems\r\nto ebb away during the earthquake, the land is really being raised out of\r\nthe sea, hundreds of miles of coast, perhaps, or a whole island, at once,\r\nby the force of the steam and gas imprisoned under the ground.  That\r\nsteam stretches and strains the solid rocks below, till they can bear no\r\nmore, and snap, and crack, with frightful roar and clang; then out of\r\nholes and chasms in the ground rush steam, gases--often foul and\r\npoisonous ones--hot water, mud, flame, strange stones--all signs that the\r\ngreat boiler down below has burst at last.\r\n\r\nThen the strain is eased.  The earth sinks together again, as the ball\r\ndid when it was pricked; and sinks lower, perhaps, than it was before:\r\nand back rushes the sea, which the earth had thrust away while it rose,\r\nand sweeps in, destroying all before it.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a great deal more to be said about all this: but I\r\nhave no time to tell you now.  You will read it, I hope, for yourselves\r\nwhen you grow up, in the writings of far wiser men than I.  Or perhaps\r\nyou may feel for yourselves in foreign lands the actual shock of a great\r\nearthquake, or see its work fresh done around you.  And if ever that\r\nhappens, and you be preserved during the danger, you will learn for\r\nyourself, I trust, more about earthquakes than I can teach you, if you\r\nwill only bear in mind the simple general rules for understanding the\r\n\"how\" of them which I have given you here.\r\n\r\nBut you do not seem satisfied yet?  What is it that you want to know?\r\n\r\nOh!  There was an earthquake here in England the other night, while you\r\nwere asleep; and that seems to you too near to be pleasant.  Will there\r\never be earthquakes in England which will throw houses down, and bury\r\npeople in the ruins?\r\n\r\nMy dear child, I think you may set your heart at rest upon that point.  As\r\nfar as the history of England goes back, and that is more than a thousand\r\nyears, there is no account of any earthquake which has done any serious\r\ndamage, or killed, I believe, a single human being.  The little\r\nearthquakes which are sometimes felt in England run generally up one line\r\nof country, from Devonshire through Wales, and up the Severn valley into\r\nCheshire and Lancashire, and the south-west of Scotland; and they are\r\nfelt more smartly there, I believe, because the rocks are harder there\r\nthan here, and more tossed about by earthquakes which happened ages and\r\nages ago, long before man lived on the earth.  I will show you the work\r\nof these earthquakes some day, in the tilting and twisting of the layers\r\nof rock, and in the cracks (faults, as they are called) which run through\r\nthem in different directions.  I showed you some once, if you recollect,\r\nin the chalk cliff at Ramsgate--two set of cracks, sloping opposite ways,\r\nwhich I told you were made by two separate sets of earthquakes, long,\r\nlong ago, perhaps while the chalk was still at the bottom of a deep sea.\r\nBut even in the rocky parts of England the earthquake-force seems to have\r\nall but died out.  Perhaps the crust of the earth has become too thick\r\nand solid there to be much shaken by the gases and steam below.  In this\r\neastern part of England, meanwhile, there is but little chance that an\r\nearthquake will ever do much harm, because the ground here, for thousands\r\nof feet down, is not hard and rocky, but soft--sands, clays, chalk, and\r\nsands again; clays, soft limestones, and clays again--which all act as\r\nbuffers to deaden the earthquake shocks, and deaden too the earthquake\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nAnd how?\r\n\r\nPut your ear to one end of a soft bolster, and let some one hit the other\r\nend.  You will hear hardly any noise, and will not feel the blow at all.\r\nPut your ear to one end of a hard piece of wood, and let some one hit the\r\nother.  You will hear a smart tap; and perhaps feel a smart tap, too.\r\nWhen you are older, and learn the laws of sound, and of motion among the\r\nparticles of bodies, you will know why.  Meanwhile you may comfort\r\nyourself with the thought that Madam How has (doubtless by command of\r\nLady Why) prepared a safe soft bed for this good people of Britain--not\r\nthat they may lie and sleep on it, but work and till, plant and build and\r\nmanufacture, and thrive in peace and comfort, we will trust and pray, for\r\nmany a hundred years to come.  All that the steam inside the earth is\r\nlikely to do to us, is to raise parts of this island (as Hartford Bridge\r\nFlats were raised, ages ago, out of the old icy sea) so slowly, probably,\r\nthat no man can tell whether they are rising or not.  Or again, the steam-\r\npower may be even now dying out under our island, and letting parts of it\r\nsink slowly into the sea, as some wise friends of mine think that the\r\nfens in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire are sinking now.  I have shown you\r\nwhere that kind of work has gone on in Norfolk; how the brow of\r\nSandringham Hill was once a sea-cliff, and Dersingham Bog at its foot a\r\nshallow sea; and therefore that the land has risen there.  How, again, at\r\nHunstanton Station there is a beach of sea-shells twenty feet above high-\r\nwater mark, showing that the land has risen there likewise.  And how,\r\nfarther north again, at Brancaster, there are forests of oak, and fir,\r\nand alder, with their roots still in the soil, far below high-water mark,\r\nand only uncovered at low tide; which is a plain sign that there the land\r\nhas sunk.  You surely recollect the sunken forest at Brancaster, and the\r\nbeautiful shells we picked up in its gullies, and the millions of live\r\nPholases boring into the clay and peat which once was firm dry land, fed\r\nover by giant oxen, and giant stags likewise, and perhaps by the mammoth\r\nhimself, the great woolly elephant whose teeth the fishermen dredge up in\r\nthe sea outside?  You recollect that?  Then remember that as that Norfolk\r\nshore has changed, so slowly but surely is the whole world changing\r\naround us.  Hartford Bridge Flat here, for instance, how has it changed!\r\nAges ago it was the gravelly bottom of a sea.  Then the steam-power\r\nunderground raised it up slowly, through long ages, till it became dry\r\nland.  And ages hence, perhaps, it will have become a sea-bottom once\r\nmore.  Washed slowly by the rain, or sunk by the dying out of the steam-\r\npower underground, it will go down again to the place from whence it\r\ncame.  Seas will roll where we stand now, and new lands will rise where\r\nseas now roll.  For all things on this earth, from the tiniest flower to\r\nthe tallest mountain, change and change all day long.  Every atom of\r\nmatter moves perpetually; and nothing \"continues in one stay.\"  The solid-\r\nseeming earth on which you stand is but a heaving bubble, bursting ever\r\nand anon in this place and in that.  Only above all, and through all, and\r\nwith all, is One who does not move nor change, but is the same yesterday,\r\nto-day, and for ever.  And on Him, my child, and not on this bubble of an\r\nearth, do you and I, and all mankind, depend.\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet told you why the Peruvians ought to have expected an\r\nearthquake.  True.  I will tell you another time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--VOLCANOS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou want to know why the Spaniards in Peru and Ecuador should have\r\nexpected an earthquake.\r\n\r\nBecause they had had so many already.  The shaking of the ground in their\r\ncountry had gone on perpetually, till they had almost ceased to care\r\nabout it, always hoping that no very heavy shock would come; and being,\r\nnow and then, terribly mistaken.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the province of Quito, in the year 1797, from thirty to\r\nforty thousand people were killed at once by an earthquake.  One would\r\nhave thought that warning enough: but the warning was not taken: and now,\r\nthis very year, thousands more have been killed in the very same country,\r\nin the very same way.\r\n\r\nThey might have expected as much.  For their towns are built, most of\r\nthem, close to volcanos--some of the highest and most terrible in the\r\nworld.  And wherever there are volcanos there will be earthquakes.  You\r\nmay have earthquakes without volcanos, now and then; but volcanos without\r\nearthquakes, seldom or never.\r\n\r\nHow does that come to pass?  Does a volcano make earthquakes?  No; we may\r\nrather say that earthquakes are trying to make volcanos.  For volcanos\r\nare the holes which the steam underground has burst open that it may\r\nescape into the air above.  They are the chimneys of the great\r\nblast-furnaces underground, in which Madam How pounds and melts up the\r\nold rocks, to make them into new ones, and spread them out over the land\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAnd are there many volcanos in the world?  You have heard of Vesuvius, of\r\ncourse, in Italy; and Etna, in Sicily; and Hecla, in Iceland.  And you\r\nhave heard, too, of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, and of Pele's\r\nHair--the yellow threads of lava, like fine spun glass, which are blown\r\nfrom off its pools of fire, and which the Sandwich Islanders believed to\r\nbe the hair of a goddess who lived in the crater;--and you have read,\r\ntoo, I hope, in Miss Yonge's _Book of Golden Deeds_, the noble story of\r\nthe Christian chieftainess who, in order to persuade her subjects to\r\nbecome Christians also, went down into the crater and defied the goddess\r\nof the volcano, and came back unhurt and triumphant.\r\n\r\nBut if you look at the map, you will see that there are many, many more.\r\nGet Keith Johnston's Physical Atlas from the schoolroom--of course it is\r\nthere (for a schoolroom without a physical atlas is like a needle without\r\nan eye)--and look at the map which is called \"Phenomena of Volcanic\r\nAction.\"\r\n\r\nYou will see in it many red dots, which mark the volcanos which are still\r\nburning: and black dots, which mark those which have been burning at some\r\ntime or other, not very long ago, scattered about the world.  Sometimes\r\nthey are single, like the red dot at Otaheite, or at Easter Island in the\r\nPacific.  Sometimes the are in groups, or clusters, like the cluster at\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, or in the Friendly Islands, or in New Zealand.  And\r\nif we look in the Atlantic, we shall see four clusters: one in poor half-\r\ndestroyed Iceland, in the far north, one in the Azores, one in the\r\nCanaries, and one in the Cape de Verds.  And there is one dot in those\r\nCanaries which we must not overlook, for it is no other than the famous\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, a volcano which is hardly burnt out yet, and may burn\r\nup again any day, standing up out of the sea more than 12,000 feet high\r\nstill, and once it must have been double that height.  Some think that it\r\nis perhaps the true Mount Atlas, which the old Greeks named when first\r\nthey ventured out of the Straits of Gibraltar down the coast of Africa,\r\nand saw the great peak far to the westward, with the clouds cutting off\r\nits top; and said that it was a mighty giant, the brother of the Evening\r\nStar, who held up the sky upon his shoulders, in the midst of the\r\nFortunate Islands, the gardens of the daughter of the Evening Star, full\r\nof strange golden fruits; and that Perseus had turned him into stone,\r\nwhen he passed him with the Gorgon's Head.\r\n\r\nBut you will see, too, that most of these red and black dots run in\r\ncrooked lines; and that many of the clusters run in lines likewise.\r\n\r\nLook at one line: by far the largest on the earth.  You will learn a good\r\ndeal of geography from it.\r\n\r\nThe red dots begin at a place called the Terribles, on the east side of\r\nthe Bay of Bengal.  They run on, here and there, along the islands of\r\nSumatra and Java, and through the Spice Islands; and at New Guinea the\r\nline of red dots forks.  One branch runs south-east, through islands\r\nwhose names you never heard, to the Friendly Islands, and to New Zealand.\r\nThe other runs north, through the Philippines, through Japan, through\r\nKamschatka; and then there is a little break of sea, between Asia and\r\nAmerica: but beyond it, the red dots begin again in the Aleutian Islands,\r\nand then turn down the whole west coast of America, down from Mount Elias\r\n(in what was, till lately, Russian America) towards British Columbia.\r\nThen, after a long gap, there are one or two in Lower California (and we\r\nmust not forget the terrible earthquake which has just shaken San\r\nFrancisco, between those two last places); and when we come down to\r\nMexico we find the red dots again plentiful, and only too plentiful; for\r\nthey mark the great volcanic line of Mexico, of which you will read, I\r\nhope, some day, in Humboldt's works.  But the line does not stop there.\r\nAfter the little gap of the Isthmus of Panama, it begins again in Quito,\r\nthe very country which has just been shaken, and in which stand the huge\r\nvolcanos Chimborazo, Pasto, Antisana, Cotopaxi, Pichincha,\r\nTunguragua,--smooth cones from 15,000 to 20,000 feet high, shining white\r\nwith snow, till the heat inside melts it off, and leaves the cinders of\r\nwhich the peaks are made all black and ugly among the clouds, ready to\r\nburst in smoke and fire.  South of them again, there is a long gap, and\r\nthen another line of red dots--Arequiba, Chipicani, Gualatieri,\r\nAtacama,--as high as, or higher than those in Quito; and this, remember,\r\nis the other country which has just been shaken.  On the sea-shore below\r\nthose volcanos stood the hapless city of Arica, whose ruins we saw in the\r\npicture.  Then comes another gap; and then a line of more volcanos in\r\nChili, at the foot of which happened that fearful earthquake of 1835\r\n(besides many more) of which you will read some day in that noble book\r\n_The Voyage of the Beagle_; and so the line of dots runs down to the\r\nsouthernmost point of America.\r\n\r\nWhat a line we have traced!  Long enough to go round the world if it were\r\nstraight.  A line of holes out of which steam, and heat, and cinders, and\r\nmelted stones are rushing up, perpetually, in one place and another.  Now\r\nthe holes in this line which are near each other have certainly something\r\nto do with each other.  For instance, when the earth shook the other day\r\nround the volcanos of Quito, it shook also round the volcanos of Peru,\r\nthough they were 600 miles away.  And there are many stories of\r\nearthquakes being felt, or awful underground thunder heard, while\r\nvolcanos were breaking out hundreds of miles away.  I will give you a\r\nvery curious instance of that.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the West Indies on the map, you will see a line of red\r\ndots runs through the Windward Islands: there are two volcanos in them,\r\none in Guadaloupe, and one in St. Vincent (I will tell you a curious\r\nstory, presently, about that last), and little volcanos (if they have\r\never been real volcanos at all), which now only send out mud, in\r\nTrinidad.  There the red dots stop: but then begins along the north coast\r\nof South America a line of mountain country called Cumana, and Caraccas,\r\nwhich has often been horribly shaken by earthquakes.  Now once, when the\r\nvolcano in St. Vincent began to pour out a vast stream of melted lava, a\r\nnoise like thunder was heard underground, over thousands of square miles\r\nbeyond those mountains, in the plains of Calabozo, and on the banks of\r\nthe Apure, more than 600 miles away from the volcano,--a plain sign that\r\nthere was something underground which joined them together, perhaps a\r\nlong crack in the earth.  Look for yourselves at the places, and you will\r\nsee that (as Humboldt says) it is as strange as if an eruption of Mount\r\nVesuvius was heard in the north of France.\r\n\r\nSo it seems as if these lines of volcanos stood along cracks in the rind\r\nof the earth, through which the melted stuff inside was for ever trying\r\nto force its way; and that, as the crack got stopped up in one place by\r\nthe melted stuff cooling and hardening again into stone, it was burst in\r\nanother place, and a fresh volcano made, or an old one re-opened.\r\n\r\nNow we can understand why earthquakes should be most common round\r\nvolcanos; and we can understand, too, why they would be worst before a\r\nvolcano breaks out, because then the steam is trying to escape; and we\r\ncan understand, too, why people who live near volcanos are glad to see\r\nthem blazing and spouting, because then they have hope that the steam has\r\nfound its way out, and will not make earthquakes any more for a while.\r\nBut still that is merely foolish speculation on chance.  Volcanos can\r\nnever be trusted.  No one knows when one will break out, or what it will\r\ndo; and those who live close to them--as the city of Naples is close to\r\nMount Vesuvius--must not be astonished if they are blown up or swallowed\r\nup, as that great and beautiful city of Naples may be without a warning,\r\nany day.\r\n\r\nFor what happened to that same Mount Vesuvius nearly 1800 years ago, in\r\nthe old Roman times?  For ages and ages it had been lying quiet, like any\r\nother hill.  Beautiful cities were built at its foot, filled with people\r\nwho were as handsome, and as comfortable, and (I am afraid) as wicked, as\r\npeople ever were on earth.  Fair gardens, vineyards, olive-yards, covered\r\nthe mountain slopes.  It was held to be one of the Paradises of the\r\nworld.  As for the mountain's being a burning mountain, who ever thought\r\nof that?  To be sure, on the top of it was a great round crater, or cup,\r\na mile or more across, and a few hundred yards deep.  But that was all\r\novergrown with bushes and wild vines, full of boars and deer.  What sign\r\nof fire was there in that?  To be sure, also, there was an ugly place\r\nbelow by the sea-shore, called the Phlegraen fields, where smoke and\r\nbrimstone came out of the ground, and a lake called Avernus over which\r\npoisonous gases hung, and which (old stories told) was one of the mouths\r\nof the Nether Pit.  But what of that?  It had never harmed any one, and\r\nhow could it harm them?\r\n\r\nSo they all lived on, merrily and happily enough, till, in the year A.D.\r\n79 (that was eight years, you know, after the Emperor Titus destroyed\r\nJerusalem), there was stationed in the Bay of Naples a Roman admiral,\r\ncalled Pliny, who was also a very studious and learned man, and author of\r\na famous old book on natural history.  He was staying on shore with his\r\nsister; and as he sat in his study she called him out to see a strange\r\ncloud which had been hanging for some time over the top of Mount\r\nVesuvius.  It was in shape just like a pine-tree; not, of course, like\r\none of our branching Scotch firs here, but like an Italian stone pine,\r\nwith a long straight stem and a flat parasol-shaped top.  Sometimes it\r\nwas blackish, sometimes spotted; and the good Admiral Pliny, who was\r\nalways curious about natural science, ordered his cutter and went away\r\nacross the bay to see what it could be.  Earthquake shocks had been very\r\ncommon for the last few days; but I do not suppose that Pliny had any\r\nnotion that the earthquakes and the cloud had aught to do with each\r\nother.  However, he soon found out that they had, and to his cost.  When\r\nhe got near the opposite shore some of the sailors met him and entreated\r\nhim to turn back.  Cinders and pumice-stones were falling down from the\r\nsky, and flames breaking out of the mountain above.  But Pliny would go\r\non: he said that if people were in danger, it was his duty to help them;\r\nand that he must see this strange cloud, and note down the different\r\nshapes into which it changed.  But the hot ashes fell faster and faster;\r\nthe sea ebbed out suddenly, and left them nearly dry, and Pliny turned\r\naway to a place called Stabiae, to the house of his friend Pomponianus,\r\nwho was just going to escape in a boat.  Brave Pliny told him not to be\r\nafraid, ordered his bath like a true Roman gentleman, and then went into\r\ndinner with a cheerful face.  Flames came down from the mountain, nearer\r\nand nearer as the night drew on; but Pliny persuaded his friend that they\r\nwere only fires in some villages from which the peasants had fled, and\r\nthen went to bed and slept soundly.  However, in the middle of the night\r\nthey found the courtyard being fast filled with cinders, and, if they had\r\nnot woke up the Admiral in time, he would never have been able to get out\r\nof the house.  The earthquake shocks grew stronger and fiercer, till the\r\nhouse was ready to fall; and Pliny and his friend, and the sailors and\r\nthe slaves, all fled into the open fields, amid a shower of stones and\r\ncinders, tying pillows over their heads to prevent their being beaten\r\ndown.  The day had come by this time, but not the dawn--for it was still\r\npitch dark as night.  They went down to their boats upon the shore; but\r\nthe sea raged so horribly that there was no getting on board of them.\r\nThen Pliny grew tired, and made his men spread a sail for him, and lay\r\ndown on it; but there came down upon them a rush of flames, and a\r\nhorrible smell of sulphur, and all ran for their lives.  Some of the\r\nslaves tried to help the Admiral upon his legs; but he sank down again\r\noverpowered with the brimstone fumes, and so was left behind.  When they\r\ncame back again, there he lay dead, but with his clothes in order and his\r\nface as quiet as if he had been only sleeping.  And that was the end of a\r\nbrave and learned man--a martyr to duty and to the love of science.\r\n\r\nBut what was going on in the meantime?  Under clouds of ashes, cinders,\r\nmud, lava, three of those happy cities were buried at once--Herculaneum,\r\nPompeii, Stabiae.  They were buried just as the people had fled from\r\nthem, leaving the furniture and the earthenware, often even jewels and\r\ngold, behind, and here and there among them a human being who had not had\r\ntime to escape from the dreadful deluge of dust.  The ruins of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii have been dug into since; and the paintings,\r\nespecially in Pompeii, are found upon the walls still fresh, preserved\r\nfrom the air by the ashes which have covered them in.  When you are older\r\nyou perhaps will go to Naples, and see in its famous museum the\r\ncuriosities which have been dug out of the ruined cities; and you will\r\nwalk, I suppose, along the streets of Pompeii and see the wheel-tracks in\r\nthe pavement, along which carts and chariots rumbled 2000 years ago.\r\nMeanwhile, if you go nearer home, to the Crystal Palace and to the\r\nPompeian Court, as it is called, you will see an exact model of one of\r\nthese old buried houses, copied even to the very paintings on the wells,\r\nand judge for yourself, as far as a little boy can judge, what sort of\r\nlife these thoughtless, luckless people lived 2000 years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd what had become of Vesuvius, the treacherous mountain?  Half or more\r\nthan half of the side of the old crater had been blown away, and what was\r\nleft, which is now called the Monte Somma, stands in a half circle round\r\nthe new cone and new crater which is burning at this very day.  True,\r\nafter that eruption which killed Pliny, Vesuvius fell asleep again, and\r\ndid not awake for 134 years, and then again for 269 years but it has been\r\ngrowing more and more restless as the ages have passed on, and now hardly\r\na year passes without its sending out smoke and stones from its crater,\r\nand streams of lava from its sides.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I suppose, you will want to know what a volcano is like, and\r\nwhat a cone, and a crater, and lava are?\r\n\r\nWhat a volcano is like, it is easy enough to show you; for they are the\r\nmost simply and beautifully shaped of all mountains, and they are alike\r\nall over the world, whether they be large or small.  Almost every volcano\r\nin the world, I believe, is, or has been once, of the shape which you see\r\nin the drawing opposite; even those volcanos in the Sandwich Islands, of\r\nwhich you have often heard, which are now great lakes of boiling fire\r\nupon flat downs, without any cone to them at all.  They, I believe, are\r\nvolcanos which have fallen in ages ago: just as in Java a whole burning\r\nmountain fell in on the night of the 11th of August, in the year 1772.\r\nThen, after a short and terrible earthquake, a bright cloud suddenly\r\ncovered the whole mountain.  The people who dwelt around it tried to\r\nescape; but before the poor souls could get away the earth sunk beneath\r\ntheir feet, and the whole mountain fell in and was swallowed up with a\r\nnoise as if great cannon were being fired.  Forty villages and nearly\r\n3000 people were destroyed, and where the mountain had been was only a\r\nplain of red-hot stones.  In the same way, in the year 1698, the top of a\r\nmountain in Quito fell in in a single night, leaving only two immense\r\npeaks of rock behind, and pouring out great floods of mud mixed with dead\r\nfish; for there are underground lakes among those volcanos which swarm\r\nwith little fish which never see the light.\r\n\r\nBut most volcanos as I say, are, or have been, the shape of the one which\r\nyou see here.  This is Cotopaxi, in Quito, more than 19,000 feet in\r\nheight.  All those sloping sides are made of cinders and ashes, braced\r\ntogether, I suppose, by bars of solid lava-stone inside, which prevent\r\nthe whole from crumbling down.  The upper part, you see, is white with\r\nsnow, as far down as a line which is 15,000 feet above the sea; for the\r\nmountain is in the tropics, close to the equator, and the snow will not\r\nlie in that hot climate any lower down.  But now and then the snow melts\r\noff and rushes down the mountain side in floods of water and of mud, and\r\nthe cindery cone of Cotopaxi stands out black and dreadful against the\r\nclear blue sky, and then the people of that country know what is coming.\r\nThe mountain is growing so hot inside that it melts off its snowy\r\ncovering; and soon it will burst forth with smoke and steam, and red-hot\r\nstones and earthquakes, which will shake the ground, and roars that will\r\nbe heard, it may be, hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the words cone, crater, lava.  If I can make you understand\r\nthose words, you will see why volcanos must be in general of the shape of\r\nCotopaxi.\r\n\r\nCone, crater, lava: those words make up the alphabet of volcano learning.\r\nThe cone is the outside of a huge chimney; the crater is the mouth of it.\r\nThe lava is the ore which is being melted in the furnace below, that it\r\nmay flow out over the surface of the old land, and make new land instead.\r\n\r\nAnd where is the furnace itself?  Who can tell that?  Under the roots of\r\nthe mountains, under the depths of the sea; down \"the path which no fowl\r\nknoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: the lion's whelp hath\r\nnot trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.  There He putteth forth\r\nHis hand upon the rock; He overturneth the mountain by the roots; He\r\ncutteth out rivers among the rocks; and His eye seeth every precious\r\nthing\"--while we, like little ants, run up and down outside the earth,\r\nscratching, like ants, a few feet down, and calling that a deep ravine;\r\nor peeping a few feet down into the crater of a volcano, unable to guess\r\nwhat precious things may lie below--below even the fire which blazes and\r\nroars up through the thin crust of the earth.  For of the inside of this\r\nearth we know nothing whatsoever: we only know that it is, on an average,\r\nseveral times as heavy as solid rock; but how that can be, we know not.\r\n\r\nSo let us look at the chimney, and what comes out of it; for we can see\r\nvery little more.\r\n\r\nWhy is a volcano like a cone?\r\n\r\nFor the same cause for which a molehill is like a cone, though a very\r\nrough one; and that the little heaps which the burrowing beetles make on\r\nthe moor, or which the ant-lions in France make in the sand, are all\r\nsomething in the shape of a cone, with a hole like a crater in the\r\nmiddle.  What the beetle and the ant-lion do on a very little scale, the\r\nsteam inside the earth does on a great scale.  When once it has forced a\r\nvent into the outside air, it tears out the rocks underground, grinds\r\nthem small against each other, often into the finest dust, and blasts\r\nthem out of the hole which it has made.  Some of them fall back into the\r\nhole, and are shot out again: but most of them fall round the hole, most\r\nof them close to it, and fewer of them farther off, till they are piled\r\nup in a ring round it, just as the sand is piled up round a beetle's\r\nburrow.  For days, and weeks, and months this goes on; even it may be for\r\nhundreds of years: till a great cone is formed round the steam vent,\r\nhundreds or thousands of feet in height, of dust and stones, and of\r\ncinders likewise.  For recollect, that when the steam has blown away the\r\ncold earth and rock near the surface of the ground, it begins blowing out\r\nthe hot rocks down below, red-hot, white-hot, and at last actually\r\nmelted.  But these, as they are hurled into the cool air above, become\r\nashes, cinders, and blocks of stone again, making the hill on which they\r\nfall bigger and bigger continually.  And thus does wise Madam How stand\r\nin no need of bricklayers, but makes her chimneys build themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd why is the mouth of the chimney called a crater?\r\n\r\nCrater, as you know, is Greek for a cup.  And the mouth of these\r\nchimneys, when they have become choked and stopped working, are often\r\njust the shape of a cup, or (as the Germans call them) kessels, which\r\nmeans kettles, or caldrons.  I have seen some of them as beautifully and\r\nexactly rounded as if a cunning engineer had planned them, and had them\r\ndug out with the spade.  At first, of course, their sides and bottom are\r\nnothing but loose stones, cinders, slag, ashes, such as would be thrown\r\nout of a furnace.  But Madam How, who, whenever she makes an ugly\r\ndesolate place, always tries to cover over its ugliness, and set\r\nsomething green to grow over it, and make it pretty once more, does so\r\noften and often by her worn-out craters.  I have seen them covered with\r\nshort sweet turf, like so many chalk downs.  I have seen them, too,\r\nfilled with bushes, which held woodcocks and wild boars.  Once I came on\r\na beautiful round crater on the top of a mountain, which was filled at\r\nthe bottom with a splendid crop of potatoes.  Though Madam How had not\r\nput them there herself, she had at least taught the honest Germans to put\r\nthem there.  And often Madam How turns her worn-out craters into\r\nbeautiful lakes.  There are many such crater-lakes in Italy, as you will\r\nsee if ever you go there; as you may see in English galleries painted by\r\nWilson, a famous artist who died before you were born.  You recollect\r\nLord Macaulay's ballad, \"The Battle of the Lake Regillus\"?  Then that\r\nLake Regillus (if I recollect right) is one of these round crater lakes.\r\nMany such deep clear blue lakes have I seen in the Eifel, in Germany; and\r\nmany a curious plant have I picked on their shores, where once the steam\r\nblasted, and the earthquake roared, and the ash-clouds rushed up high\r\ninto the heaven, and buried all the land around in dust, which is now\r\nfertile soil.  And long did I puzzle to find out why the water stood in\r\nsome craters, while others, within a mile of them perhaps, were perfectly\r\ndry.  That I never found out for myself.  But learned men tell me that\r\nthe ashes which fall back into the crater, if the bottom of it be wet\r\nfrom rain, will sometimes \"set\" (as it is called) into a hard cement; and\r\nso make the bottom of the great bowl waterproof, as if it were made of\r\nearthenware.\r\n\r\nBut what gives the craters this cup-shape at first?\r\n\r\nThink--While the steam and stones are being blown out, the crater is an\r\nopen funnel, with more or less upright walls inside.  As the steam grows\r\nweaker, fewer and fewer stones fall outside, and more and more fall back\r\nagain inside.  At last they quite choke up the bottom of the great round\r\nhole.  Perhaps, too, the lava or melted rock underneath cools and grows\r\nhard, and that chokes up the hole lower down.  Then, down from the round\r\nedge of the crater the stones and cinders roll inward more and more.  The\r\nrains wash them down, the wind blows them down.  They roll to the middle,\r\nand meet each other, and stop.  And so gradually the steep funnel becomes\r\na round cup.  You may prove for yourself that it must be so, if you will\r\ntry.  Do you not know that if you dig a round hole in the ground, and\r\nleave it to crumble in, it is sure to become cup-shaped at last, though\r\nat first its sides may have been quite upright, like those of a bucket?\r\nIf you do not know, get a trowel and make your little experiment.\r\n\r\nAnd now you ought to understand what \"cone\" and \"crater\" mean.  And more,\r\nif you will think for yourself, you may guess what would come out of a\r\nvolcano when it broke out \"in an eruption,\" as it is usually called.\r\nFirst, clouds of steam and dust (what you would call smoke); then volleys\r\nof stones, some cool, some burning hot; and at the last, because it lies\r\nlowest of all, the melted rock itself, which is called lava.\r\n\r\nAnd where would that come out?  At the top of the chimney?  At the top of\r\nthe cone?\r\n\r\nNo.  Madam How, as I told you, usually makes things make themselves.  She\r\nhas made the chimney of the furnace make itself; and next she will make\r\nthe furnace-door make itself.\r\n\r\nThe melted lava rises in the crater--the funnel inside the cone--but it\r\nnever gets to the top.  It is so enormously heavy that the sides of the\r\ncone cannot bear its weight, and give way low down.  And then, through\r\nashes and cinders, the melted lava burrows out, twisting and twirling\r\nlike an enormous fiery earth-worm, till it gets to the air outside, and\r\nruns off down the mountain in a stream of fire.  And so you may see (as\r\nare to be seen on Vesuvius now) two eruptions at once--one of burning\r\nstones above, and one of melted lava below.\r\n\r\nAnd what is lava?\r\n\r\nThat, I think, I must tell you another time.  For when I speak of it I\r\nshall have to tell you more about Madam How, and her ways of making the\r\nground on which you stand, than I can say just now.  But if you want to\r\nknow (as I dare say you do) what the eruption of a volcano is like, you\r\nmay read what follows.  I did not see it happen; for I never had the good\r\nfortune of seeing a mountain burning, though I have seen many and many a\r\none which has been burnt--extinct volcanos, as they are called.\r\n\r\nThe man who saw it--a very good friend of mine, and a very good man of\r\nscience also--went last year to see an eruption on Vesuvius, not from the\r\nmain crater, but from a small one which had risen up suddenly on the\r\noutside of it; and he gave me leave (when I told him that I was writing\r\nfor children) to tell them what he saw.\r\n\r\nThis new cone, he said, was about 200 feet high, and perhaps 80 or 100\r\nfeet across at the top.  And as he stood below it (it was not safe to go\r\nup it) smoke rolled up from its top, \"rosy pink below,\" from the glare of\r\nthe caldron, and above \"faint greenish or blueish silver of indescribable\r\nbeauty, from the light of the moon.\"  But more--By good chance, the cone\r\nbegan to send out, not smoke only, but brilliant burning stones.  \"Each\r\nexplosion,\" he says, \"was like a vast girandole of rockets, with a noise\r\n(such as rockets would make) like the waves on a beach, or the wind\r\nblowing through shrouds.  The mountain was trembling the whole time.  So\r\nit went on for two hours and more; sometimes eight or ten explosions in a\r\nminute, and more than 1000 stones in each, some as large as two bricks\r\nend to end.  The largest ones mostly fell back into the crater; but the\r\nsmaller ones being thrown higher, and more acted on by the wind, fell in\r\nimmense numbers on the leeward slope of the cone\" (of course, making it\r\nbigger and bigger, as I have explained already to you), and of course, as\r\nthey were intensely hot and bright, making the cone look as if it too was\r\nred-hot.  But it was not so, he says, really.  The colour of the stones\r\nwas rather \"golden, and they spotted the black cone over with their\r\ngolden showers, the smaller ones stopping still, the bigger ones rolling\r\ndown, and jumping along just like hares.\"  \"A wonderful pedestal,\" he\r\nsays, \"for the explosion which surmounted it.\"  How high the stones flew\r\nup he could not tell.  \"There was generally one which went much higher\r\nthan the rest, and pierced upwards towards the moon, who looked calmly\r\ndown, mocking such vain attempts to reach her.\"  The large stones, of\r\ncourse, did not rise so high; and some, he says, \"only just appeared over\r\nthe rim of the cone, above which they came floating leisurely up, to show\r\ntheir brilliant forms and intense white light for an instant, and then\r\nsubside again.\"\r\n\r\nTry and picture that to yourselves, remembering that this was only a\r\nlittle side eruption, of no more importance to the whole mountain than\r\nthe fall of a slate off the roof is of importance to the whole house.  And\r\nthen think how mean and weak man's fireworks, and even man's heaviest\r\nartillery, are compared with the terrible beauty and terrible strength of\r\nMadam How's artillery underneath our feet.\r\n\r\n                 C\r\n               / | \\\r\n              /  |  \\\r\n          A  /---+---\\  E\r\n            /    |    \\\r\n           /-----+-----\\  E\r\nGround    /      | B    \\      Ground\r\n---------/       |       \\------------\r\n        |  D  |  | D |  D  |\r\n      --+-----+--+---+-----+------\r\n        |     |  |   |     |\r\n                 |\r\n\r\nNow look at this figure.  It represents a section of a volcano; that is,\r\none cut in half to show you the inside.  A is the cone of cinders.  B,\r\nthe black line up through the middle, is the funnel, or crack, through\r\nwhich steam, ashes, lava, and everything else rises.  C is the crater\r\nmouth.  D D D, which looks broken, are the old rocks which the steam\r\nheaved up and burst before it could get out.  And what are the black\r\nlines across, marked E E E?  They are the streams of lava which have\r\nburrowed out, some covered up again in cinders, some lying bare in the\r\nopen air, some still inside the cone, bracing it together, holding it up.\r\nSomething like this is the inside of a volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF A GRAIN OF SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, you ask, are there such terrible things as volcanos?  Of what use\r\ncan they be?\r\n\r\nThey are of use enough, my child; and of many more uses, doubt not, than\r\nwe know as yet, or ever shall know.  But of one of their uses I can tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThey make, or help to make, divers and sundry curious things, from\r\ngunpowder to your body and mine.\r\n\r\nWhat?  I can understand their helping to make gunpowder, because the\r\nsulphur in it is often found round volcanos; and I know the story of the\r\nbrave Spaniard who, when his fellows wanted materials for gunpowder, had\r\nhimself lowered in a basket down the crater of a South American volcano,\r\nand gathered sulphur for them off the burning cliffs: but how can\r\nvolcanos help to make me?  Am I made of lava?  Or is there lava in me?\r\n\r\nMy child, I did not say that volcanos helped to make you.  I said that\r\nthey helped to make your body; which is a very different matter, as I beg\r\nyou to remember, now and always.  Your body is no more you yourself than\r\nthe hoop which you trundle, or the pony which you ride.  It is, like\r\nthem, your servant, your tool, your instrument, your organ, with which\r\nyou work: and a very useful, trusty, cunningly-contrived organ it is; and\r\ntherefore I advise you to make good use of it, for you are responsible\r\nfor it.  But you yourself are not your body, or your brain, but something\r\nelse, which we call your soul, your spirit, your life.  And that \"you\r\nyourself\" would remain just the same if it were taken out of your body,\r\nand put into the body of a bee, or of a lion, or any other body; or into\r\nno body at all.  At least so I believe; and so, I am happy to say, nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine people out\r\nof every million have always believed, because they have used their human\r\ninstincts and their common sense, and have obeyed (without knowing it)\r\nthe warning of a great and good philosopher called Herder, that \"The\r\norgan is in no case the power which works by it;\" which is as much as to\r\nsay, that the engine is not the engine-driver, nor the spade the\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\nThere have always been, and always will be, a few people who cannot see\r\nthat.  They think that a man's soul is part of his body, and that he\r\nhimself is not one thing, but a great number of things.  They think that\r\nhis mind and character are only made up of all the thoughts, and\r\nfeelings, and recollections which have passed through his brain; and that\r\nas his brain changes, he himself must change, and become another person,\r\nand then another person again, continually.  But do you not agree with\r\nthem: but keep in mind wise Herder's warning that you are not to\r\n\"confound the organ with the power,\" or the engine with the driver, or\r\nyour body with yourself: and then we will go on and consider how a\r\nvolcano, and the lava which flows from it, helps to make your body.\r\n\r\nNow I know that the Scotch have a saying, \"That you cannot make broth out\r\nof whinstones\" (which is their name for lava).  But, though they are very\r\nclever people, they are wrong there.  I never saw any broth in Scotland,\r\nas far as I know, but what whinstones had gone to the making of it; nor a\r\nScotch boy who had not eaten many a bit of whinstone, and been all the\r\nbetter for it.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you simply put the whinstones into a kettle and boiled\r\nthem, you would not get much out of them by such rough cookery as that.\r\nBut Madam How is the best and most delicate of all cooks; and she knows\r\nhow to pound, and soak, and stew whinstones so delicately, that she can\r\nmake them sauce and seasoning for meat, vegetables, puddings, and almost\r\neverything that you eat; and can put into your veins things which were\r\nspouted up red-hot by volcanos, ages and ages since, perhaps at the\r\nbottom of ancient seas which are now firm dry land.\r\n\r\nThis is very strange--as all Madam How's doings are.  And you would think\r\nit stranger still if you had ever seen the flowing of a lava stream.\r\n\r\nOut of a cave of slag and cinders in the black hillside rushes a golden\r\nriver, flowing like honey, and yet so tough that you cannot thrust a\r\nstick into it, and so heavy that great stones (if you throw them on it)\r\nfloat on the top, and are carried down like corks on water.  It is so hot\r\nthat you cannot stand near it more than a few seconds; hotter, perhaps,\r\nthan any fire you ever saw: but as it flows, the outside of it cools in\r\nthe cool air, and gets covered with slag and cinders, something like\r\nthose which you may see thrown out of the furnaces in the Black Country\r\nof Staffordshire.  Sometimes these cling together above the lava stream,\r\nand make a tunnel, through the cracks in which you may see the fiery\r\nriver rushing and roaring down below.  But mostly they are kept broken\r\nand apart, and roll and slide over each other on the top of the lava,\r\ncrashing and clanging as they grind together with a horrid noise.  Of\r\ncourse that stream, like all streams, runs towards the lower grounds.  It\r\nslides down glens, and fills them up; down the beds of streams, driving\r\noff the water in hissing steam; and sometimes (as it did in Iceland a few\r\nyears ago) falls over some cliff, turning what had been a water-fall into\r\na fire-fall, and filling up the pool below with blocks of lava suddenly\r\ncooled, with a clang and roar like that of chains shaken or brazen\r\nvessels beaten, which is heard miles and miles away.  Of course, woe to\r\nthe crops and gardens which stand in its way.  It crawls over them all\r\nand eats them up.  It shoves down houses; it sets woods on fire, and\r\nsends the steam and gas out of the tree-trunks hissing into the air.  And\r\n(curiously enough) it does this often without touching the trees\r\nthemselves.  It flows round the trunks (it did so in a wood in the\r\nSandwich Islands a few years ago), and of course sets them on fire by its\r\nheat, till nothing is left of them but blackened posts.  But the moisture\r\nwhich comes out of the poor tree in steam blows so hard against the lava\r\nround that it can never touch the tree, and a round hole is left in the\r\nmiddle of the lava where the tree was.  Sometimes, too, the lava will\r\nspit out liquid fire among the branches of the trees, which hangs down\r\nafterwards from them in tassels of slag, and yet, by the very same means,\r\nthe steam in the branches will prevent the liquid fire burning them off,\r\nor doing anything but just scorch the bark.\r\n\r\nBut I can tell you a more curious story still.  The lava stream, you must\r\nknow, is continually sending out little jets of gas and steam: some of it\r\nit may have brought up from the very inside of the earth; most of it, I\r\nsuspect, comes from the damp herbage and damp soil over which it runs.  Be\r\nthat as it may, a lava stream out of Mount Etna, in Sicily, came once\r\ndown straight upon the town of Catania.  Everybody thought that the town\r\nwould be swallowed up; and the poor people there (who knew no better)\r\nbegan to pray to St. Agatha--a famous saint, who, they say, was martyred\r\nthere ages ago--and who, they fancy, has power in heaven to save them\r\nfrom the lava stream.  And really what happened was enough to make\r\nignorant people, such as they were, think that St. Agatha had saved them.\r\nThe lava stream came straight down upon the town wall.  Another foot, and\r\nit would have touched it, and have begun shoving it down with a force\r\ncompared with which all the battering-rams that you ever read of in\r\nancient histories would be child's toys.  But lo and behold! when the\r\nlava stream got within a few inches of the wall it stopped, and began to\r\nrear itself upright and build itself into a wall beside the wall.  It\r\nrose and rose, till I believe in one place it overtopped the wall and\r\nbegan to curl over in a crest.  All expected that it would fall over into\r\nthe town at last: but no, there it stopped, and cooled, and hardened, and\r\nleft the town unhurt.  All the inhabitants said, of course, that St.\r\nAgatha had done it: but learned men found out that, as usual Madam How\r\nhad done it, by making it do itself.  The lava was so full of gas, which\r\nwas continually blowing out in little jets, that when it reached the\r\nwall, it actually blew itself back from the wall; and, as the wall was\r\nluckily strong enough not to be blown down, the lava kept blowing itself\r\nback till it had time to cool.  And so, my dear child, there was no\r\nmiracle at all in the matter; and the poor people of Catania had to thank\r\nnot St. Agatha, and any interference of hers, but simply Him who can\r\npreserve, just as He can destroy, by those laws of nature which are the\r\nbreath of His mouth and the servants of His will.\r\n\r\nBut in many a case the lava does not stop.  It rolls on and on over the\r\ndowns and through the valleys, till it reaches the sea-shore, as it did\r\nin Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands this very year.  And then it cools, of\r\ncourse; but often not before it has killed the fish by its sulphurous\r\ngases and heat, perhaps for miles around.  And there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that the fossil fish which we so often find in rocks, perfect in\r\nevery bone, lying sometimes in heaps, and twisted (as I have seen them)\r\nas if they had died suddenly and violently, were killed in this very way,\r\neither by heat from lava streams, or else by the bursting up of gases\r\npoisoning the water, in earthquakes and eruptions in the bottom of the\r\nsea.  I could tell you many stories of fish being killed in thousands by\r\nearthquakes and volcanos during the last few years.  But we have not time\r\nto tell about everything.\r\n\r\nAnd now you will ask me, with more astonishment than ever, what possible\r\nuse can there be in these destroying streams of fire?  And certainly, if\r\nyou had ever seen a lava stream even when cool, and looked down, as I\r\nhave done, at the great river of rough black blocks streaming away far\r\nand wide over the land, you would think it the most hideous and the most\r\nuseless thing you ever saw.  And yet, my dear child, there is One who\r\ntold men to judge not according to the appearance, but to judge righteous\r\njudgment.  He said that about matters spiritual and human: but it is\r\nquite as true about matters natural, which also are His work, and all\r\nobey His will.\r\n\r\nNow if you had seen, as I have seen, close round the edges of these lava\r\nstreams, and sometimes actually upon them, or upon the great bed of dust\r\nand ashes which have been hurled far and wide out of ancient volcanos,\r\nhappy homesteads, rich crops, hemp and flax, and wheat, tobacco, lucerne,\r\nroots, and vineyards laden with white and purple grapes, you would have\r\nbegun to suspect that the lava streams were not, after all, such very bad\r\nneighbours.  And when I tell you that volcanic soils (as they are\r\ncalled), that is, soil which has at first been lava or ashes, are\r\ngenerally the richest soils in the world--that, for instance (as some one\r\ntold me the other day), there is soil in the beautiful island of Madeira\r\nso thin that you cannot dig more than two or three inches down without\r\ncoming to the solid rock of lava, or what is harder even, obsidian (which\r\nis the black glass which volcanos sometimes make, and which the old\r\nMexicans used to chip into swords and arrows, because they had no\r\nsteel)--and that this soil, thin as it is, is yet so fertile, that in it\r\nused to be grown the grapes of which the famous Madeira wine was\r\nmade--when you remember this, and when you remember, too, the Lothians of\r\nScotland (about which I shall have to say a little to you just now), then\r\nyou will perhaps agree with me, that Lady Why has not been so very wrong\r\nin setting Madam How to pour out lava and ashes upon the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nFor see--down below, under the roots of the mountains, Madam How works\r\ncontinually like a chemist in his laboratory, melting together all the\r\nrocks, which are the bones and leavings of the old worlds.  If they\r\nstayed down below there, they would be of no use; while they will be of\r\nuse up here in the open air.  For, year by year--by the washing of rain\r\nand rivers, and also, I am sorry to say, by the ignorant and foolish\r\nwaste of mankind--thousands and millions of tons of good stuff are\r\nrunning into the sea every year, which would, if it could be kept on\r\nland, make food for men and animals, plants and trees.  So, in order to\r\nsupply the continual waste of this upper world, Madam How is continually\r\nmelting up the under world, and pouring it out of the volcanos like\r\nmanure, to renew the face of the earth.  In these lava rocks and ashes\r\nwhich she sends up there are certain substances, without which men cannot\r\nlive--without which a stalk of corn or grass cannot grow.  Without\r\npotash, without magnesia, both of which are in your veins and\r\nmine--without silicates (as they are called), which give flint to the\r\nstems of corn and of grass, and so make them stiff and hard, and able to\r\nstand upright--and very probably without the carbonic acid gas, which\r\ncomes out of the volcanos, and is taken up by the leaves of plants, and\r\nturned by Madam How's cookery into solid wood--without all these things,\r\nand I suspect without a great many more things which come out of\r\nvolcanos--I do not see how this beautiful green world could get on at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOf course, when the lava first cools on the surface of the ground it is\r\nhard enough, and therefore barren enough.  But Madam How sets to work\r\nupon it at once, with that delicate little water-spade of hers, which we\r\ncall rain, and with that alone, century after century, and age after age,\r\nshe digs the lava stream down, atom by atom, and silts it over the\r\ncountry round in rich manure.  So that if Madam How has been a rough and\r\nhasty workwoman in pumping her treasures up out of her mine with her\r\ngreat steam-pumps, she shows herself delicate and tender and kindly\r\nenough in giving them away afterwards.\r\n\r\nNay, even the fine dust which is sometimes blown out of volcanos is\r\nuseful to countries far away.  So light it is, that it rises into the sky\r\nand is wafted by the wind across the seas.  So, in the year 1783, ashes\r\nfrom the Skaptar Jokull, in Iceland, were carried over the north of\r\nScotland, and even into Holland, hundreds of miles to the south.\r\n\r\nSo, again, when in the year 1812 the volcano of St. Vincent, in the West\r\nIndia Islands, poured out torrents of lava, after mighty earthquakes\r\nwhich shook all that part of the world, a strange thing happened (about\r\nwhich I have often heard from those who saw it) in the island of\r\nBarbados, several hundred miles away.  For when the sun rose in the\r\nmorning (it was a Sunday morning), the sky remained more dark than any\r\nnight, and all the poor negroes crowded terrified out of their houses\r\ninto the streets, fancying the end of the world was come.  But a learned\r\nman who was there, finding that, though the sun was risen, it was still\r\npitchy dark, opened his window, and found that it was stuck fast by\r\nsomething on the ledge outside, and, when he thrust it open, found the\r\nledge covered deep in soft red dust; and he instantly said, like a wise\r\nman as he was, \"The volcano of St. Vincent must have broken out, and\r\nthese are the ashes from it.\"  Then he ran down stairs and quieted the\r\npoor negroes, telling them not to be afraid, for the end of the world was\r\nnot coming just yet.  But still the dust went on falling till the whole\r\nisland, I am told, was covered an inch thick; and the same thing happened\r\nin the other islands round.  People thought--and they had reason to think\r\nfrom what had often happened elsewhere--that though the dust might hurt\r\nthe crops for that year, it would make them richer in years to come,\r\nbecause it would act as manure upon the soil; and so it did after a few\r\nyears; but it did terrible damage at the time, breaking off the boughs of\r\ntrees and covering up the crops; and in St. Vincent itself whole estates\r\nwere ruined.  It was a frightful day, but I know well that behind that\r\nHow there was a Why for its happening, and happening too, about that very\r\ntime, which all who know the history of negro slavery in the West Indies\r\ncan guess for themselves, and confess, I hope, that in this case, as in\r\nall others, when Lady Why seems most severe she is often most just and\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAh! my dear child, that I could go on talking to you of this for hours\r\nand days!  But I have time now only to teach you the alphabet of these\r\nmatters--and, indeed, I know little more than the alphabet myself; but if\r\nthe very letters of Madam How's book, and the mere A, B, AB, of it, which\r\nI am trying to teach you, are so wonderful and so beautiful, what must\r\nits sentences be and its chapters?  And what must the whole book be like?\r\nBut that last none can read save He who wrote it before the worlds were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nBut now I see you want to ask a question.  Let us have it out.  I would\r\nsooner answer one question of yours than tell you ten things without your\r\nasking.\r\n\r\nIs there potash and magnesia and silicates in the soil here?  And if\r\nthere is, where did they come from?  For there are no volcanos in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nYes.  There are such things in the soil; and little enough of them, as\r\nthe farmers here know too well.  For we here, in Windsor Forest, are on\r\nthe very poorest and almost the newest soil in England; and when Madam\r\nHow had used up all her good materials in making the rest of the island,\r\nshe carted away her dry rubbish and shot it down here for us to make the\r\nbest of; and I do not think that we and our forefathers have done so very\r\nill with it.  But where the rich part, or staple, of our soils came from\r\nfirst it would be very difficult to say, so often has Madam How made, and\r\nunmade, and re-made England, and sifted her materials afresh every time.\r\nBut if you go to the Lowlands of Scotland, you may soon see where the\r\nstaple of the soil came from there, and that I was right in saying that\r\nthere were atoms of lava in every Scotch boy's broth.  Not that there\r\nwere ever (as far as I know) volcanos in Scotland or in England.  Madam\r\nHow has more than one string to her bow, or two strings either; so when\r\nshe pours out her lavas, she does not always pour them out in the open\r\nair.  Sometimes she pours them out at the bottom of the sea, as she did\r\nin the north of Ireland and the south-west of Scotland, when she made the\r\nGiant's Causeway, and Fingal's Cave in Staffa too, at the bottom of the\r\nold chalk ocean, ages and ages since.  Sometimes she squirts them out\r\nbetween the layers of rock, or into cracks which the earthquakes have\r\nmade, in what are called trap dykes, of which there are plenty to be seen\r\nin Scotland, and in Wales likewise.  And then she lifts the earth up from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and sets the rain to wash away all the soft rocks,\r\ntill the hard lava stands out in great hills upon the surface of the\r\nground.  Then the rain begins eating away those lava-hills likewise, and\r\nmanuring the earth with them; and wherever those lava-hills stand up,\r\nwhether great or small, there is pretty sure to be rich land around them.\r\nIf you look at the Geological Map of England and Ireland, and the red\r\nspots upon it, which will show you where those old lavas are, you will\r\nsee how much of them there is in England, at the Lizard Point in\r\nCornwall, and how much more in Scotland and the north of Ireland.  In\r\nSouth Devon, in Shropshire--with its beautiful Wrekin, and Caradoc, and\r\nLawley--in Wales, round Snowdon (where some of the soil is very rich),\r\nand, above all, in the Lowlands of Scotland, you see these red marks,\r\nshowing the old lavas, which are always fertile, except the poor old\r\ngranite, which is of little use save to cut into building stone, because\r\nit is too full of quartz--that is, flint.\r\n\r\nThink of this the next time you go through Scotland in the railway,\r\nespecially when you get near Edinburgh.  As you run through the Lothians,\r\nwith their noble crops of corn, and roots, and grasses--and their great\r\nhomesteads, each with its engine chimney, which makes steam do the work\r\nof men--you will see rising out of the plain, hills of dark rock,\r\nsometimes in single knobs, like Berwick Law or Stirling Crag--sometimes\r\nin noble ranges, like Arthur's Seat, or the Sidlaws, or the Ochils.  Think\r\nwhat these black bare lumps of whinstone are, and what they do.  Remember\r\nthey are mines--not gold mines, but something richer still--food mines,\r\nwhich Madam How thrust into the inside of the earth, ages and ages since,\r\nas molten lava rock, and then cooled them and lifted them up, and pared\r\nthem away with her ice-plough and her rain-spade, and spread the stuff of\r\nthem over the wide carses round, to make in that bleak northern climate,\r\nwhich once carried nothing but fir-trees and heather, a soil fit to feed\r\na great people; to cultivate in them industry, and science, and valiant\r\nself-dependence and self-help; and to gather round the Heart of\r\nMidlothian and the Castle Rock of Edinburgh the stoutest and the ablest\r\nlittle nation which Lady Why has made since she made the Greeks who\r\nfought at Salamis.\r\n\r\nOf those Greeks you have read, or ought to read, in Mr. Cox's _Tales of\r\nthe Persian War_.  Some day you will read of them in their own books,\r\nwritten in their grand old tongue.  Remember that Lady Why made them, as\r\nshe has made the Scotch, by first preparing a country for them, which\r\nwould call out all their courage and their skill; and then by giving them\r\nthe courage and the skill to make use of the land where she had put them.\r\n\r\nAnd now think what a wonderful fairy tale you might write for\r\nyourself--and every word of it true--of the adventures of one atom of\r\nPotash or some other Salt, no bigger than a needle's point, in such a\r\nlava stream as I have been telling of.  How it has run round and round,\r\nand will run round age after age, in an endless chain of change.  How it\r\nbegan by being molten fire underground, how then it became part of a hard\r\ncold rock, lifted up into a cliff, beaten upon by rain and storm, and\r\nwashed down into the soil of the plain, till, perhaps, the little atom of\r\nmineral met with the rootlet of some great tree, and was taken up into\r\nits sap in spring, through tiny veins, and hardened the next year into a\r\npiece of solid wood.  And then how that tree was cut down, and its logs,\r\nit may be, burnt upon the hearth, till the little atom of mineral lay\r\namong the wood-ashes, and was shovelled out and thrown upon the field and\r\nwashed into the soil again, and taken up by the roots of a clover plant,\r\nand became an atom of vegetable matter once more.  And then how, perhaps,\r\na rabbit came by, and ate the clover, and the grain of mineral became\r\npart of the rabbit; and then how a hawk killed that rabbit, and ate it,\r\nand so the grain became part of the hawk; and how the farmer shot the\r\nhawk, and it fell perchance into a stream, and was carried down into the\r\nsea; and when its body decayed, the little grain sank through the water,\r\nand was mingled with the mud at the bottom of the sea.  But do its\r\nwanderings stop there?  Not so, my child.  Nothing upon this earth, as I\r\ntold you once before, continues in one stay.  That grain of mineral might\r\nstay at the bottom of the sea a thousand or ten thousand years, and yet\r\nthe time would come when Madam How would set to work on it again.  Slowly,\r\nperhaps, she would sink that mud so deep, and cover it up with so many\r\nfresh beds of mud, or sand, or lime, that under the heavy weight, and\r\nperhaps, too, under the heat of the inside of the earth, that Mud would\r\nslowly change to hard Slate Rock; and ages after, it may be, Madam How\r\nmight melt that Slate Rock once more, and blast it out; and then through\r\nthe mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise into the\r\nopen air again to make fresh soil, as it had done thousands of years\r\nbefore.  For Madam How can manufacture many different things out of the\r\nsame materials.  She may have so wrought with that grain of mineral, that\r\nshe may have formed it into part of a precious stone, and men may dig it\r\nout of the rock, or pick it up in the river-bed, and polish it, and set\r\nit, and wear it.  Think of that--that in the jewels which your mother or\r\nyour sisters wear, or in your father's signet ring, there may be atoms\r\nwhich were part of a live plant, or a live animal, millions of years ago,\r\nand may be parts of a live plant or a live animal millions of years\r\nhence.\r\n\r\nThink over again, and learn by heart, the links of this endless chain of\r\nchange: Fire turned into Stone--Stone into Soil--Soil into Plant--Plant\r\ninto Animal--Animal into Soil--Soil into Stone--Stone into Fire again--and\r\nthen Fire into Stone again, and the old thing run round once more.\r\n\r\nSo it is, and so it must be.  For all things which are born in Time must\r\nchange in Time, and die in Time, till that Last Day of this our little\r\nearth, in which,\r\n\r\n   \"Like to the baseless fabric of a vision,\r\n   The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n   The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n   Yea, all things which inherit, shall dissolve,\r\n   And, like an unsubstantial pageant faded,\r\n   Leave not a rack behind.\"\r\n\r\nSo all things change and die, and so your body too must change and\r\ndie--but not yourself.  Madam How made your body; and she must unmake it\r\nagain, as she unmakes all her works in Time and Space; but you, child,\r\nyour Soul, and Life, and Self, she did not make; and over you she has no\r\npower.  For you were not, like your body, created in Time and Space; and\r\nyou will endure though Time and Space should be no more: because you are\r\nthe child of the Living God, who gives to each thing its own body, and\r\ncan give you another body, even as seems good to Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--THE ICE-PLOUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nYou want to know why I am so fond of that little bit of limestone, no\r\nbigger than my hand, which lies upon the shelf; why I ponder over it so\r\noften, and show it to all sensible people who come to see me?\r\n\r\nI do so, not only for the sake of the person who gave it to me, but\r\nbecause there is written on it a letter out of Madam How's alphabet,\r\nwhich has taken wise men many a year to decipher.  I could not decipher\r\nthat letter when first I saw the stone.  More shame for me, for I had\r\nseen it often before, and understood it well enough, in many another page\r\nof Madam How's great book.  Take the stone, and see if you can find out\r\nanything strange about it.\r\n\r\nWell, it is only a bit of marble as big as my hand, that looks as if it\r\nhad been, and really has been, broken off by a hammer.  But when you look\r\nagain, you see there is a smooth scraped part on one edge, that seems to\r\nhave been rubbed against a stone.\r\n\r\nNow look at that rubbed part, and tell me how it was done.\r\n\r\nYou have seen men often polish one stone on another, or scour floors with\r\na Bath brick, and you will guess at first that this was polished so: but\r\nif it had been, then the rubbed place would have been flat: but if you\r\nput your fingers over it, you will find that it is not flat.  It is\r\nrolled, fluted, channelled, so that the thing or things which rubbed it\r\nmust have been somewhat round.  And it is covered, too, with very fine\r\nand smooth scratches or grooves, all running over the whole in the same\r\nline.  Now what could have done that?\r\n\r\nOf course a man could have done it, if he had taken a large round stone\r\nin his hand, and worked the large channellings with that, and then had\r\ntaken fine sand and gravel upon the points of his fingers, and worked the\r\nsmall scratches with that.  But this stone came from a place where man\r\nhad, perhaps, never stood before,--ay, which, perhaps, had never seen the\r\nlight of day before since the world was made; and as I happen to know\r\nthat no man made the marks upon that stone, we must set to work and think\r\nagain for some tool of Madam How's which may have made them.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think you must give up guessing, and I must tell you the answer\r\nto the riddle.  Those marks were made by a hand which is strong and yet\r\ngentle, tough and yet yielding, like the hand of a man; a hand which\r\nhandles and uses in a grip stronger than a giant's its own carving tools,\r\nfrom the great boulder stone as large as this whole room to the finest\r\ngrain of sand.  And that is ICE.\r\n\r\nThat piece of stone came from the side of the Rosenlaui glacier in\r\nSwitzerland, and it was polished by the glacier ice.  The glacier melted\r\nand shrank this last hot summer farther back than it had done for many\r\nyears, and left bare sheets of rock, which it had been scraping at for\r\nages, with all the marks fresh upon them.  And that bit was broken off\r\nand brought to me, who never saw a glacier myself, to show me how the\r\nmarks which the ice makes in Switzerland are exactly the same as those\r\nwhich the ice has made in Snowdon and in the Highlands, and many another\r\nplace where I have traced them, and written a little, too, about them in\r\nyears gone by.  And so I treasure this, as a sign that Madam How's ways\r\ndo not change nor her laws become broken; that, as that great philosopher\r\nSir Charles Lyell will tell you, when you read his books, Madam How is\r\nmaking and unmaking the surface of the earth now, by exactly the same\r\nmeans as she was making and unmaking ages and ages since; and that what\r\nis going on slowly and surely in the Alps in Switzerland was going on\r\nonce here where we stand.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult, I know, for a little boy like you to understand how\r\nice, and much more how soft snow, should have such strength that it can\r\ngrind this little stone, much more such strength as to grind whole\r\nmountains into plains.  You have never seen ice and snow do harm.  You\r\ncannot even recollect the Crimean Winter, as it was called then; and well\r\nfor you you cannot, considering all the misery it brought at home and\r\nabroad.  You cannot, I say, recollect the Crimean Winter, when the Thames\r\nwas frozen over above the bridges, and the ice piled in little bergs ten\r\nto fifteen feet high, which lay, some of them, stranded on the shores,\r\nabout London itself, and did not melt, if I recollect, until the end of\r\nMay.  You never stood, as I stood, in the great winter of 1837-8 on\r\nBattersea Bridge, to see the ice break up with the tide, and saw the\r\ngreat slabs and blocks leaping and piling upon each other's backs, and\r\nfelt the bridge tremble with their shocks, and listened to their horrible\r\ngrind and roar, till one got some little picture in one's mind of what\r\nmust be the breaking up of an ice-floe in the Arctic regions, and what\r\nmust be the danger of a ship nipped in the ice and lifted up on high,\r\nlike those in the pictures of Arctic voyages which you are so fond of\r\nlooking through.  You cannot recollect how that winter even in our little\r\nBlackwater Brook the alder stems were all peeled white, and scarred, as\r\nif they had been gnawed by hares and deer, simply by the rushing and\r\nscraping of the ice,--a sight which gave me again a little picture of the\r\ndestruction which the ice makes of quays, and stages, and houses along\r\nthe shore upon the coasts of North America, when suddenly setting in with\r\nwind and tide, it jams and piles up high inland, as you may read for\r\nyourself some day in a delightful book called _Frost and Fire_.  You\r\nrecollect none of these things.  Ice and snow are to you mere playthings;\r\nand you long for winter, that you may make snowballs and play hockey and\r\nskate upon the ponds, and eat ice like a foolish boy till you make your\r\nstomach ache.  And I dare say you have said, like many another boy, on a\r\nbright cheery ringing frosty day, \"Oh, that it would be always winter!\"\r\nYou little knew for what you asked.  You little thought what the earth\r\nwould soon be like, if it were always winter,--if one sheet of ice on the\r\npond glued itself on to the bottom of the last sheet, till the whole pond\r\nwas a solid mass,--if one snow-fall lay upon the top of another snow-fall\r\ntill the moor was covered many feet deep and the snow began sliding\r\nslowly down the glen from Coombs's, burying the green fields, tearing the\r\ntrees up by their roots, burying gradually house, church, and village,\r\nand making this place for a few thousand years what it was many thousand\r\nyears ago.  Good-bye then, after a very few winters, to bees, and\r\nbutterflies, and singing-birds, and flowers; and good-bye to all\r\nvegetables, and fruit, and bread; good-bye to cotton and woollen clothes.\r\nYou would have, if you were left alive, to dress in skins, and eat fish\r\nand seals, if any came near enough to be caught.  You would have to live\r\nin a word, if you could live at all, as Esquimaux live now in Arctic\r\nregions, and as people had to live in England ages since, in the times\r\nwhen it was always winter, and icebergs floated between here and\r\nFinchampstead.  Oh no, my child: thank Heaven that it is not always\r\nwinter; and remember that winter ice and snow, though it is a very good\r\ntool with which to make the land, must leave the land year by year if\r\nthat land is to be fit to live in.\r\n\r\nI said that if the snow piled high enough upon the moor, it would come\r\ndown the glen in a few years through Coombs's Wood; and I said then you\r\nwould have a small glacier here--such a glacier (to compare small things\r\nwith great) as now comes down so many valleys in the Alps, or has come\r\ndown all the valleys of Greenland and Spitzbergen till they reach the\r\nsea, and there end as cliffs of ice, from which great icebergs snap off\r\ncontinually, and fall and float away, wandering southward into the\r\nAtlantic for many a hundred miles.  You have seen drawings of such\r\nglaciers in Captain Cook's Voyages; and you may see photographs of Swiss\r\nglaciers in any good London print-shop; and therefore you have seen\r\nalmost as much about them as I have seen, and may judge for yourself how\r\nyou would like to live where it is always winter.\r\n\r\nNow you must not ask me to tell you what a glacier is like, for I have\r\nnever seen one; at least, those which I have seen were more than fifty\r\nmiles away, looking like white clouds hanging on the gray mountain sides.\r\nAnd it would be an impertinence--that means a meddling with things which\r\nI have no business--to picture to you glaciers which have been pictured\r\nso well and often by gentlemen who escape every year from their hard work\r\nin town to find among the glaciers of the Alps health and refreshment,\r\nand sound knowledge, and that most wholesome and strengthening of all\r\nmedicines, toil.\r\n\r\nSo you must read of them in such books as _Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers_,\r\nand Mr. Willes's _Wanderings in the High Alps_, and Professor Tyndall's\r\ndifferent works; or you must look at them (as I just now said) in\r\nphotographs or in pictures.  But when you do that, or when you see a\r\nglacier for yourself, you must bear in mind what a glacier means--that it\r\nis a river of ice, fed by a lake of snow.  The lake from which it springs\r\nis the eternal snow-field which stretches for miles and miles along the\r\nmountain tops, fed continually by fresh snow-storms falling from the sky.\r\nThat snow slides off into the valleys hour by hour, and as it rushes down\r\nis ground and pounded, and thawed and frozen again into a sticky paste of\r\nice, which flows slowly but surely till it reaches the warm valley at the\r\nmountain foot, and there melts bit by bit.  The long black lines which\r\nyou see winding along the white and green ice of the glacier are the\r\nstones which have fallen from the cliffs above.  They will be dropped at\r\nthe end of the glacier, and mixed with silt and sand and other stones\r\nwhich have come down inside the glacier itself, and piled up in the field\r\nin great mounds, which are called moraines, such as you may see and walk\r\non in Scotland many a time, though you might never guess what they are.\r\n\r\nThe river which runs out at the glacier foot is, you must remember, all\r\nfoul and milky with the finest mud; and that mud is the grinding of the\r\nrocks over which the glacier has been crawling down, and scraping them as\r\nit scraped my bit of stone with pebbles and with sand.  And this is the\r\nalphabet, which, if you learn by heart, you will learn to understand how\r\nMadam How uses her great ice-plough to plough down her old mountains, and\r\nspread the stuff of them about the valleys to make rich straths of\r\nfertile soil.  Nay, so immensely strong, because immensely heavy, is the\r\nshare of this her great ice-plough, that some will tell you (and it is\r\nnot for me to say that they are wrong) that with it she has ploughed out\r\nall the mountain lakes in Europe and in North America; that such lakes,\r\nfor instance, as Ullswater or Windermere have been scooped clean out of\r\nthe solid rock by ice which came down these glaciers in old times.  And\r\nbe sure of this, that next to Madam How's steam-pump and her rain-spade,\r\nher great ice-plough has had, and has still, the most to do with making\r\nthe ground on which we live.\r\n\r\nDo I mean that there were ever glaciers here?  No, I do not.  There have\r\nbeen glaciers in Scotland in plenty.  And if any Scotch boy shall read\r\nthis book, it will tell him presently how to find the marks of them far\r\nand wide over his native land.  But as you, my child, care most about\r\nthis country in which you live, I will show you in any gravel-pit, or\r\nhollow lane upon the moor, the marks, not of a glacier, which is an ice-\r\nriver, but of a whole sea of ice.\r\n\r\nLet us come up to the pit upon the top of the hill, and look carefully at\r\nwhat we see there.  The lower part of the pit of course is a solid rock\r\nof sand.  On the top of that is a cap of gravel, five, six, ten feet\r\nthick.  Now the sand was laid down there by water at the bottom of an old\r\nsea; and therefore the top of it would naturally be flat and smooth, as\r\nthe sands at Hunstanton or at Bournemouth are; and the gravel, if it was\r\nlaid down by water, would naturally lie flat on it again: but it does\r\nnot.  See how the top of the sand is dug out into deep waves and pits,\r\nfilled up with gravel.  And see, too, how over some of the gravel you get\r\nsand again, and then gravel again, and then sand again, till you cannot\r\ntell where one fairly begins and the other ends.  Why, here are little\r\ndots of gravel, six or eight feet down, in what looks the solid sand\r\nrock, yet the sand must have been opened somehow to put the gravel in.\r\n\r\nYou say you have seen that before.  You have seen the same curious\r\ntwisting of the gravel and sand into each other on the top of Farley\r\nHill, and in the new cutting on Minley Hill; and, best of all, in the\r\nrailway cutting between Ascot and Sunningdale, where upon the top the\r\nwhite sand and gravel is arranged in red and brown waves, and festoons,\r\nand curlicues, almost like Prince of Wales's feathers.  Yes, that last is\r\na beautiful section of ice-work; so beautiful, that I hope to have it\r\nphotographed some day.\r\n\r\nNow, how did ice do this?\r\n\r\nWell, I was many a year before I found out that, and I dare say I never\r\nshould have found it out for myself.  A gentleman named Trimmer, who,\r\nalas! is now dead, was, I believe, the first to find it out.  He knew\r\nthat along the coast of Labrador, and other cold parts of North America,\r\nand on the shores, too, of the great river St. Lawrence, the stranded\r\nicebergs, and the ice-foot, as it is called, which is continually forming\r\nalong the freezing shores, grub and plough every tide into the mud and\r\nsand, and shove up before them, like a ploughshare, heaps of dirt; and\r\nthat, too, the ice itself is full of dirt, of sand and stones, which it\r\nmay have brought from hundreds of miles away; and that, as this\r\nploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward, the nose of the plough is\r\ncontinually being broken off, and left underneath the mud; and that, when\r\nsummer comes, and the ice melts, the mud falls back into the place where\r\nthe ice had been, and covers up the gravel which was in the ice.  So,\r\nwhat between the grubbing of the ice-plough into the mud, and the dirt\r\nwhich it leaves behind when it melts, the stones, and sand, and mud upon\r\nthe shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers, exactly\r\nlike those which Mr. Trimmer saw in certain gravel-pits.  And when I\r\nfirst read about that, I said, \"And exactly like what I have been seeing\r\nin every gravel-pit round here, and trying to guess how they could have\r\nbeen made by currents of water, and yet never could make any guess which\r\nwould do.\"  But after that it was all explained to me; and I said,\r\n\"Honour to the man who has let Madam How teach him what she had been\r\ntrying to teach me for fifteen years, while I was too stupid to learn it.\r\nNow I am certain, as certain as I can be of any earthly thing, that the\r\nwhole of these Windsor Forest Flats were ages ago ploughed and harrowed\r\nover and over again, by ice-floes and icebergs drifting and stranding in\r\na shallow sea.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if you say, my dear child, as some people will say, that it is like\r\nbuilding a large house upon a single brick to be sure that there was an\r\niceberg sea here, just because I see a few curlicues in the gravel and\r\nsand--then I must tell you that there are sometimes--not often, but\r\nsometimes--pages in Madam How's book in which one single letter tells you\r\nas much as a whole chapter; in which if you find one little fact, and\r\nknow what it really means, it makes you certain that a thousand other\r\ngreat facts have happened.  You may be astonished: but you cannot deny\r\nyour own eyes, and your own common sense.  You feel like Robinson Crusoe\r\nwhen, walking along the shore of his desert island, he saw for the first\r\ntime the print of a man's foot in the sand.  How it could have got there\r\nwithout a miracle he could not dream.  But there it was.  One footprint\r\nwas as good as the footprints of a whole army would have been.  A man had\r\nbeen there; and more men might come.  And in fear of the savages--and if\r\nyou have read Robinson Crusoe you know how just his fears were--he went\r\nhome trembling and loaded his muskets, and barricaded his cave, and\r\npassed sleepless nights watching for the savages who might come, and who\r\ncame after all.\r\n\r\nAnd so there are certain footprints in geology which there is no\r\nmistaking; and the prints of the ice-plough are among them.\r\n\r\nFor instance:--When they were trenching the new plantation close to\r\nWellington College station, the men turned up out of the ground a great\r\nmany Sarsden stones; that is, pieces of hard sugary sand, such as\r\nStonehenge is made of.  And when I saw these I said, \"I suspect these\r\nwere brought here by icebergs:\" but I was not sure, and waited.  As the\r\nmen dug on, they dug up a great many large flints, with bottle-green\r\ncoats.  \"Now,\" I said, \"I am sure.  For I know where these flints must\r\nhave come from.\"  And for reasons which would be too long to tell you\r\nhere, I said, \"Some time or other, icebergs have been floating northward\r\nfrom the Hog's Back over Aldershot and Farnborough, and have been trying\r\nto get into the Vale of Thames by the slope at Wellington College\r\nstation; and they have stranded, and dropped these flints.\"  And I am so\r\nsure of that, that if I found myself out wrong after all I should be at\r\nmy wit's end; for I should know that I was wrong about a hundred things\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nOr again, if you ever go up Deeside in Scotland, towards Balmoral, and\r\nturn up Glen Muick, towards Alt-na-guisach, of which you may see a\r\npicture in the Queen's last book, you will observe standing on your right\r\nhand, just above Birk Hall, three pretty rounded knolls, which they call\r\nthe Coile Hills.  You may easily know them by their being covered with\r\nbeautiful green grass instead of heather.  That is because they are made\r\nof serpentine or volcanic rock, which (as you have seen) often cuts into\r\nbeautiful red and green marble; and which also carries a very rich soil\r\nbecause it is full of magnesia.  If you go up those hills, you get a\r\nglorious view--the mountains sweeping round you where you stand, up to\r\nthe top of Lochnagar, with its bleak walls a thousand feet perpendicular,\r\nand gullies into which the sun never shines, and round to the dark fir\r\nforests of the Ballochbuie.  That is the arc of the bow; and the cord of\r\nthe bow is the silver Dee, more than a thousand feet below you; and in\r\nthe centre of the cord, where the arrow would be fitted in, stands\r\nBalmoral, with its Castle, and its Gardens, and its Park, and pleasant\r\ncottages and homesteads all around.  And when you have looked at the\r\nbeautiful amphitheatre of forest at your feet, and looked too at the\r\ngreat mountains to the westward, and Benaun, and Benna-buird and Benna-\r\nmuicdhui, with their bright patches of eternal snow, I should advise you\r\nto look at the rock on which you stand, and see what you see there.  And\r\nyou will see that on the side of the Coiles towards Lochnagar, and\r\nbetween the knolls of them, are scattered streams, as it were, of great\r\nround boulder stones--which are not serpentine, but granite from the top\r\nof Lochnagar, five miles away.  And you will see that the knolls of\r\nserpentine rock, or at least their backs and shoulders towards Lochnagar,\r\nare all smoothed and polished till they are as round as the backs of\r\nsheep, \"roches moutonnees,\" as the French call ice-polished rocks; and\r\nthen, if you understand what that means, you will say, as I said, \"I am\r\nperfectly certain that this great basin between me and Lochnagar, which\r\nis now 3000 feet deep of empty air was once filled up with ice to the\r\nheight of the hills on which I stand--about 1700 feet high--and that that\r\nice ran over into Glen Muick, between these pretty knolls, and covered\r\nthe ground where Birk Hall now stands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd more:--When you see growing on those knolls of serpentine a few\r\npretty little Alpine plants, which have no business down there so low,\r\nyou will have a fair right to say, as I said, \"The seeds of these plants\r\nwere brought by the ice ages and ages since from off the mountain range\r\nof Lochnagar, and left here, nestling among the rocks, to found a fresh\r\ncolony, far from their old mountain home.\"\r\n\r\nIf I could take you with me up to Scotland,--take you, for instance,\r\nalong the Tay, up the pass of Dunkeld, or up Strathmore towards Aberdeen,\r\nor up the Dee towards Braemar,--I could show you signs, which cannot be\r\nmistaken, of the time when Scotland was, just like Spitzbergen or like\r\nGreenland now, covered in one vast sheet of snow and ice from year's end\r\nto year's end; when glaciers were ploughing out its valleys, icebergs\r\nwere breaking off the icy cliffs and floating out to sea; when not a\r\nbird, perhaps, was to be seen save sea-fowl, not a plant upon the rocks\r\nbut a few lichens, and Alpine saxifrages, and such like--desolation and\r\ncold and lifeless everywhere.  That ice-time went on for ages and for\r\nages; and yet it did not go on in vain.  Through it Madam How was\r\nploughing down the mountains of Scotland to make all those rich farms\r\nwhich stretch from the north side of the Frith of Forth into\r\nSutherlandshire.  I could show you everywhere the green banks and knolls\r\nof earth, which Scotch people call \"kames\" and \"tomans\"--perhaps brought\r\ndown by ancient glaciers, or dropped by ancient icebergs--now so smooth\r\nand green through summer and through winter, among the wild heath and the\r\nrough peat-moss, that the old Scots fancied, and I dare say Scotch\r\nchildren fancy still, fairies dwelt inside.  If you laid your ear against\r\nthe mounds, you might hear the fairy music, sweet and faint, beneath the\r\nground.  If you watched the mound at night, you might see the fairies\r\ndancing the turf short and smooth, or riding out on fairy horses, with\r\ngreen silk clothes and jingling bells.  But if you fell asleep upon the\r\nmounds, the fairy queen came out and carried you for seven years into\r\nFairyland, till you awoke again in the same place, to find all changed\r\naround you, and yourself grown thin and old.\r\n\r\nThese are all dreams and fancies--untrue, not because they are too\r\nstrange and wonderful, but because they are not strange and wonderful\r\nenough: for more wonderful sure than any fairy tale it is, that Madam How\r\nshould make a rich and pleasant land by the brute force of ice.\r\n\r\nAnd were there any men and women in that old age of ice?  That is a long\r\nstory, and a dark one too; we will talk of it next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--THE TRUE FAIRY TALE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou asked if there were men in England when the country was covered with\r\nice and snow.  Look at this, and judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? a piece of old mortar?  Yes.  But mortar which was made Madam\r\nHow herself, and not by any man.  And what is in it?  A piece of flint\r\nand some bits of bone.  But look at that piece of flint.  It is narrow,\r\nthin, sharp-edged: quite different in shape from any bit of flint which\r\nyou or I ever saw among the hundreds of thousands of broken bits of\r\ngravel which we tread on here all day long; and here are some more bits\r\nlike it, which came from the same place--all very much the same shape,\r\nlike rough knives or razor blades; and here is a core of flint, the\r\nremaining part of a large flint, from which, as you may see, blades like\r\nthose have been split off.  Those flakes of flint, my child, were split\r\noff by men; even your young eyes ought to be able to see that.  And here\r\nare other pieces of flint--pear-shaped, but flattened, sharp at one end\r\nand left rounded at the other, which look like spear-heads, or\r\narrow-heads, or pointed axes, or pointed hatchets--even your young eyes\r\ncan see that these must have been made by man.  And they are, I may tell\r\nyou, just like the tools of flint, or of obsidian, which is volcanic\r\nglass, and which savages use still where they have not iron.  There is a\r\ngreat obsidian knife, you know, in a house in this very parish, which\r\ncame from Mexico; and your eye can tell you how like it is to these flint\r\nones.  But these flint tools are very old.  If you crack a fresh flint,\r\nyou will see that its surface is gray, and somewhat rough, so that it\r\nsticks to your tongue.  These tools are smooth and shiny: and the edges\r\nof some of them are a little rubbed from being washed about in gravel;\r\nwhile the iron in the gravel has stained them reddish, which it would\r\ntake hundreds and perhaps thousands of years to do.  There are little\r\nrough markings, too, upon some of them, which, if you look at through a\r\nmagnifying glass, are iron, crystallised into the shape of little sea-\r\nweeds and trees--another sign that they are very very old.  And what is\r\nmore, near the place where these flint flakes come from there are no\r\nflints in the ground for hundreds of miles; so that men must have brought\r\nthem there ages and ages since.  And to tell you plainly, these are\r\nscrapers such as the Esquimaux in North America still use to scrape the\r\nflesh off bones, and to clean the insides of skins.\r\n\r\nBut did these people (savages perhaps) live when the country was icy\r\ncold?  Look at the bits of bone.  They have been split, you see,\r\nlengthways; that, I suppose, was to suck the marrow out of them, as\r\nsavages do still.  But to what animal do the bones belong?  That is the\r\nquestion, and one which I could not have answered you, if wiser men than\r\nI am could not have told me.\r\n\r\nThey are the bones of reindeer--such reindeer as are now found only in\r\nLapland and the half-frozen parts of North America, close to the Arctic\r\ncircle, where they have six months day and six months night.  You have\r\nread of Laplanders, and how they drive reindeer in their sledges, and\r\nlive upon reindeer milk; and you have read of Esquimaux, who hunt seals\r\nand walrus, and live in houses of ice, lighted by lamps fed with the same\r\nblubber on which they feed themselves.  I need not tell you about them.\r\n\r\nNow comes the question--Whence did these flints and bones come?  They\r\ncame out of a cave in Dordogne, in the heart of sunny France,--far away\r\nto the south, where it is hotter every summer than it was here even this\r\nsummer, from among woods of box and evergreen oak, and vineyards of rich\r\nred wine.  In that warm land once lived savages, who hunted amid ice and\r\nsnow the reindeer, and with the reindeer animals stranger still.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will tell you a fairy tale: to make you understand it at all I\r\nmust put it in the shape of a tale.  I call it a fairy tale, because it\r\nis so strange; indeed I think I ought to call it the fairy tale of all\r\nfairy tales, for by the time we get to the end of it I think it will\r\nexplain to you how our forefathers got to believe in fairies, and trolls,\r\nand elves, and scratlings, and all strange little people who were said to\r\nhaunt the mountains and the caves.\r\n\r\nWell, once upon a time, so long ago that no man can tell when, the land\r\nwas so much higher, that between England and Ireland, and, what is more,\r\nbetween England and Norway, was firm dry land.  The country then must\r\nhave looked--at least we know it looked so in Norfolk--very like what our\r\nmoors look like here.  There were forests of Scotch fir, and of spruce\r\ntoo, which is not wild in England now, though you may see plenty in every\r\nplantation.  There were oaks and alders, yews and sloes, just as there\r\nare in our woods now.  There was buck-bean in the bogs, as there is in\r\nLarmer's and Heath pond; and white and yellow water-lilies, horn-wort,\r\nand pond-weeds, just as there are now in our ponds.  There were wild\r\nhorses, wild deer, and wild oxen, those last of an enormous size.  There\r\nwere little yellow roe-deer, which will not surprise you, for there are\r\nhundreds and thousands in Scotland to this day; and, as you know, they\r\nwill thrive well enough in our woods now.  There were beavers too: but\r\nthat must not surprise you, for there were beavers in South Wales long\r\nafter the Norman Conquest, and there are beavers still in the mountain\r\nglens of the south-east of France.  There were honest little water-rats\r\ntoo, who I dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys, nibbling the\r\nwater-lily pods, thousands of years ago, as they do in our ponds now.\r\nWell, so far we have come to nothing strange: but now begins the fairy\r\ntale.  Mixed with all these animals, there wandered about great herds of\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses; not smooth-skinned, mind, but covered with\r\nhair and wool, like those which are still found sticking out of the\r\neverlasting ice cliffs, at the mouth of the Lena and other Siberian\r\nrivers, with the flesh, and skin, and hair so fresh upon them, that the\r\nwild wolves tear it off, and snarl and growl over the carcase of monsters\r\nwho were frozen up thousands of years ago.  And with them, stranger\r\nstill, were great hippopotamuses; who came, perhaps, northward in summer\r\ntime along the sea-shore and down the rivers, having spread hither all\r\nthe way from Africa; for in those days, you must understand, Sicily, and\r\nItaly, and Malta--look at your map--were joined to the coast of Africa:\r\nand so it may be was the rock of Gibraltar itself; and over the sea where\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar now flow was firm dry land, over which hyaenas\r\nand leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses ranged into Spain; for their\r\nbones are found at this day in the Gibraltar caves.  And this is the\r\nfirst chapter of my fairy tale.\r\n\r\nNow while all this was going on, and perhaps before this began, the\r\nclimate was getting colder year by year--we do not know how; and, what is\r\nmore, the land was sinking; and it sank so deep that at last nothing was\r\nleft out of the water but the tops of the mountains in Ireland, and\r\nScotland, and Wales.  It sank so deep that it left beds of shells\r\nbelonging to the Arctic regions nearly two thousand feet high upon the\r\nmountain side.  And so\r\n\r\n      \"It grew wondrous cold,\r\n   And ice mast-high came floating by,\r\n      As green as emerald.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were no masts then to measure the icebergs by, nor any ship nor\r\nhuman being there.  All we know is that the icebergs brought with them\r\nvast quantities of mud, which sank to the bottom, and covered up that\r\npleasant old forest-land in what is called boulder-clay; clay full of\r\nbits of broken rock, and of blocks of stone so enormous, that nothing but\r\nan iceberg could have carried them.  So all the animals were drowned or\r\ndriven away, and nothing was left alive perhaps, except a few little\r\nhardy plants which clung about cracks and gullies in the mountain tops;\r\nand whose descendants live there still.  That was a dreadful time; the\r\nworst, perhaps, of all the age of Ice; and so ends the second chapter of\r\nmy fairy tale.\r\n\r\nNow for my third chapter.  \"When things come to the worst,\" says the\r\nproverb, \"they commonly mend;\" and so did this poor frozen and drowned\r\nland of England and France and Germany, though it mended very slowly.  The\r\nland began to rise out of the sea once more, and rose till it was perhaps\r\nas high as it had been at first, and hundreds of feet higher than it is\r\nnow: but still it was very cold, covered, in Scotland at least, with one\r\ngreat sea of ice and glaciers descending down into the sea, as I said\r\nwhen I spoke to you about the Ice-Plough.  But as the land rose, and grew\r\nwarmer too, while it rose, the wild beasts who had been driven out by the\r\ngreat drowning came gradually back again.  As the bottom of the old icy\r\nsea turned into dry land, and got covered with grasses, and weeds, and\r\nshrubs once more, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, oxen--sometimes\r\nthe same species, sometimes slightly different ones--returned to France,\r\nand then to England (for there was no British Channel then to stop them);\r\nand with them came other strange animals, especially the great Irish elk,\r\nas he is called, as large as the largest horse, with horns sometimes ten\r\nfeet across.  A pair of those horns with the skull you have seen\r\nyourself, and can judge what a noble animal he must have been.  Enormous\r\nbears came too, and hyaenas, and a tiger or lion (I cannot say which), as\r\nlarge as the largest Bengal tiger now to be seen in India.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days--we cannot, of course, exactly say when--there\r\ncame--first I suppose into the south and east of France, and then\r\ngradually onward into England and Scotland and Ireland--creatures without\r\nany hair to keep them warm, or scales to defend them, without horns or\r\ntusks to fight with, or teeth to worry and bite; the weakest you would\r\nhave thought of the beasts, and yet stronger than all the animals,\r\nbecause they were Men, with reasonable souls.  Whence they came we cannot\r\ntell, nor why; perhaps from mere hunting after food, and love of\r\nwandering and being independent and alone.  Perhaps they came into that\r\nicy land for fear of stronger and cleverer people than themselves; for we\r\nhave no proof, my child, none at all, that they were the first men that\r\ntrod this earth.  But be that as it may, they came; and so cunning were\r\nthese savage men, and so brave likewise, though they had no iron among\r\nthem, only flint and sharpened bones, yet they contrived to kill and eat\r\nthe mammoths, and the giant oxen, and the wild horses, and the reindeer,\r\nand to hold their own against the hyaenas, and tigers, and bears, simply\r\nbecause they had wits, and the dumb animals had none.  And that is the\r\nstrangest part to me of all my fairy tale.  For what a man's wits are,\r\nand why he has them, and therefore is able to invent and to improve,\r\nwhile even the cleverest ape has none, and therefore can invent and\r\nimprove nothing, and therefore cannot better himself, but must remain\r\nfrom father to son, and father to son again, a stupid, pitiful,\r\nridiculous ape, while men can go on civilising themselves, and growing\r\nricher and more comfortable, wiser and happier, year by year--how that\r\ncomes to pass, I say, is to me a wonder and a prodigy and a miracle,\r\nstranger than all the most fantastic marvels you ever read in fairy\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nYou may find the flint weapons which these old savages used buried in\r\nmany a gravel-pit up and down France and the south of England; but you\r\nwill find none here, for the gravel here was made (I am told) at the\r\nbeginning of the ice-time, before the north of England sunk into the sea,\r\nand therefore long, long before men came into this land.  But most of\r\ntheir remains are found in caves which water has eaten out of the\r\nlimestone rocks, like that famous cave of Kent's Hole at Torquay.  In it,\r\nand in many another cave, lie the bones of animals which the savages ate,\r\nand cracked to get the marrow out of them, mixed up with their\r\nflint-weapons and bone harpoons, and sometimes with burnt ashes and with\r\nround stones, used perhaps to heat water, as savages do now, all baked\r\ntogether into a hard paste or breccia by the lime.  These are in the\r\nwater, and are often covered with a floor of stalagmite which has dripped\r\nfrom the roof above and hardened into stone.  Of these caves and their\r\nbeautiful wonders I must tell you another day.  We must keep now to our\r\nfairy tale.  But in these caves, no doubt, the savages lived; for not\r\nonly have weapons been found in them, but actually drawings scratched (I\r\nsuppose with flint) on bone or mammoth ivory--drawings of elk, and bull,\r\nand horse, and ibex--and one, which was found in France, of the great\r\nmammoth himself, the woolly elephant, with a mane on his shoulders like a\r\nlion's mane.  So you see that one of the earliest fancies of this strange\r\ncreature, called man, was to draw, as you and your schoolfellows love to\r\ndraw, and copy what you see, you know not why.  Remember that.  You like\r\nto draw; but why you like it neither you nor any man can tell.  It is one\r\nof the mysteries of human nature; and that poor savage clothed in skins,\r\ndirty it may be, and more ignorant than you (happily) can conceive, when\r\nhe sat scratching on ivory in the cave the figures of the animals he\r\nhunted, was proving thereby that he had the same wonderful and mysterious\r\nhuman nature as you--that he was the kinsman of every painter and\r\nsculptor who ever felt it a delight and duty to copy the beautiful works\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nSometimes, again, especially in Denmark, these savages have left behind\r\nupon the shore mounds of dirt, which are called there\r\n\"kjokken-moddings\"--\"kitchen-middens\" as they would say in Scotland,\r\n\"kitchen-dirtheaps\" as we should say here down South--and a very good\r\nname for them that is; for they are made up of the shells of oysters,\r\ncockles, mussels, and periwinkles, and other shore-shells besides, on\r\nwhich those poor creatures fed; and mingled with them are broken bones of\r\nbeasts, and fishes, and birds, and flint knives, and axes, and sling\r\nstones; and here and there hearths, on which they have cooked their meals\r\nin some rough way.  And that is nearly all we know about them; but this\r\nwe know from the size of certain of the shells, and from other reasons\r\nwhich you would not understand, that these mounds were made an enormous\r\ntime ago, when the water of the Baltic Sea was far more salt than it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with my fairy tale?  This:--\r\n\r\nSuppose that these people, after all, had been fairies?\r\n\r\nI am in earnest.  Of course, I do not mean that these folk could make\r\nthemselves invisible, or that they had any supernatural powers--any more,\r\nat least, than you and I have--or that they were anything but savages;\r\nbut this I do think, that out of old stories of these savages grew up the\r\nstories of fairies, elves, and trolls, and scratlings, and cluricaunes,\r\nand ogres, of which you have read so many.\r\n\r\nWhen stronger and bolder people, like the Irish, and the Highlanders of\r\nScotland, and the Gauls of France, came northward with their bronze and\r\niron weapons; and still more, when our own forefathers, the Germans and\r\nthe Norsemen, came, these poor little savages with their flint arrows and\r\naxes, were no match for them, and had to run away northward, or to be all\r\nkilled out; for people were fierce and cruel in those old times, and\r\nlooked on every one of a different race from themselves as a natural\r\nenemy.  They had not learnt--alas! too many have not learned it yet--that\r\nall men are brothers for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.  So these\r\npoor savages were driven out, till none were left, save the little Lapps\r\nup in the north of Norway, where they live to this day.\r\n\r\nBut stories of them, and of how they dwelt in caves, and had strange\r\ncustoms, and used poisoned weapons, and how the elf-bolts (as their flint\r\narrow-heads are still called) belonged to them, lingered on, and were\r\ntold round the fire on winter nights and added to, and played with half\r\nin fun, till a hundred legends sprang up about them, which used once to\r\nbe believed by grown-up folk, but which now only amuse children.  And\r\nbecause some of these savages were very short, as the Lapps and Esquimaux\r\nare now, the story grew of their being so small that they could make\r\nthemselves invisible; and because others of them were (but probably only\r\na few) very tall and terrible, the story grew that there were giants in\r\nthat old world, like that famous Gogmagog, whom Brutus and his Britons\r\nmet (so old fables tell), when they landed first at Plymouth, and fought\r\nhim, and threw him over the cliff.  Ogres, too--of whom you read in fairy\r\ntales--I am afraid that there were such people once, even here in Europe;\r\nstrong and terrible savages, who ate human beings.  Of course, the\r\nlegends and tales about them became ridiculous and exaggerated as they\r\npassed from mouth to mouth over the Christmas fire, in the days when no\r\none could read or write.  But that the tales began by being true any one\r\nmay well believe who knows how many cannibal savages there are in the\r\nworld even now.  I think that, if ever there was an ogre in the world, he\r\nmust have been very like a certain person who lived, or was buried, in a\r\ncave in the Neanderthal, between Elberfeld and Dusseldorf, on the Lower\r\nRhine.  The skull and bones which were found there (and which are very\r\nfamous now among scientific men) belonged to a personage whom I should\r\nhave been very sorry to meet, and still more to let you meet, in the wild\r\nforest; to a savage of enormous strength of limb (and I suppose of jaw)\r\nlikewise\r\n\r\n   \"like an ape,\r\n   With forehead villainous low,\"\r\n\r\nwho could have eaten you if he would; and (I fear) also would have eaten\r\nyou if he could.  Such savages may have lingered (I believe, from the old\r\nballads and romances, that they did linger) for a long time in lonely\r\nforests and mountain caves, till they were all killed out by warriors who\r\nwore mail-armour and carried steel sword, and battle-axe, and lance.\r\n\r\nBut had these people any religion?\r\n\r\nMy dear child, we cannot know, and need not know.  But we know this--that\r\nGod beholds all the heathen.  He fashions the hearts of them, and\r\nunderstandeth all their works.  And we know also that He is just and\r\ngood.  These poor folks were, I doubt not, happy enough in their way; and\r\nwe are bound to believe (for we have no proof against it), that most of\r\nthem were honest and harmless enough likewise.  Of course, ogres and\r\ncannibals, and cruel and brutal persons (if there were any among them),\r\ndeserved punishment--and punishment, I do not doubt, they got.  But, of\r\ncourse, again, none of them knew things which you know; but for that very\r\nreason they were not bound to do many things which you are bound to do.\r\nFor those to whom little is given, of them shall little be required.  What\r\ntheir religion was like, or whether they had any religion at all, we\r\ncannot tell.  But this we can tell, that known unto God are all His works\r\nfrom the creation of the world; and that His mercy is over all His works,\r\nand He hateth nothing that He has made.  These men and women, whatever\r\nthey were, were God's work; and therefore we may comfort ourselves with\r\nthe certainty that, whether or not they knew God, God knew them.\r\n\r\nAnd so ends my fairy tale.\r\n\r\nBut is it not a wonderful tale?  More wonderful, if you will think over\r\nit, than any story invented by man.  But so it always is.  \"Truth,\" wise\r\nmen tell us, \"is stranger than fiction.\"  Even a child like you will see\r\nthat it must be so, if you will but recollect who makes fiction, and who\r\nmakes facts.\r\n\r\nMan makes fiction: he invents stories, pretty enough, fantastical enough.\r\nBut out of what does he make them up?  Out of a few things in this great\r\nworld which he has seen, and heard, and felt, just as he makes up his\r\ndreams.  But who makes truth?  Who makes facts?  Who, but God?\r\n\r\nThen truth is as much larger than fiction, as God is greater than man; as\r\nmuch larger as the whole universe is larger than the little corner of it\r\nthat any man, even the greatest poet or philosopher, can see; and as much\r\ngrander, and as much more beautiful, and as much more strange.  For one\r\nis the whole, and the other is one, a few tiny scraps of the whole.  The\r\none is the work of God; the other is the work of man.  Be sure that no\r\nman can ever fancy anything strange, unexpected, and curious, without\r\nfinding if he had eyes to see, a hundred things around his feet more\r\nstrange, more unexpected, more curious, actually ready-made already by\r\nGod.  You are fond of fairy tales, because they are fanciful, and like\r\nyour dreams.  My dear child, as your eyes open to the true fairy tale\r\nwhich Madam How can tell you all day long, nursery stories will seem to\r\nyou poor and dull.  All those feelings in you which your nursery tales\r\ncall out,--imagination, wonder, awe, pity, and I trust too, hope and\r\nlove--will be called out, I believe, by the Tale of all Tales, the true\r\n\"Marchen allen Marchen,\" so much more fully and strongly and purely, that\r\nyou will feel that novels and story-books are scarcely worth your\r\nreading, as long as you can read the great green book, of which every bud\r\nis a letter, and every tree a page.\r\n\r\nWonder if you will.  You cannot wonder too much.  That you might wonder\r\nall your life long, God put you into this wondrous world, and gave you\r\nthat faculty of wonder which he has not given to the brutes; which is at\r\nonce the mother of sound science, and a pledge of immortality in a world\r\nmore wondrous even than this.  But wonder at the right thing, not at the\r\nwrong; at the real miracles and prodigies, not at the sham.  Wonder not\r\nat the world of man.  Waste not your admiration, interest, hope on it,\r\nits pretty toys, gay fashions, fine clothes, tawdry luxuries, silly\r\namusements.  Wonder at the works of God.  You will not, perhaps, take my\r\nadvice yet.  The world of man looks so pretty, that you will needs have\r\nyour peep at it, and stare into its shop windows; and if you can, go to a\r\nfew of its stage plays, and dance at a few of its balls.  Ah--well--After\r\na wild dream comes an uneasy wakening; and after too many sweet things,\r\ncomes a sick headache.  And one morning you will awake, I trust and pray,\r\nfrom the world of man to the world of God, and wonder where wonder is\r\ndue, and worship where worship is due.  You will awake like a child who\r\nhas been at a pantomime over night, staring at the \"fairy halls,\" which\r\nare all paint and canvas; and the \"dazzling splendours,\" which are gas\r\nand oil; and the \"magic transformations,\" which are done with ropes and\r\npulleys; and the \"brilliant elves,\" who are poor little children out of\r\nthe next foul alley; and the harlequin and clown, who through all their\r\nfun are thinking wearily over the old debts which they must pay, and the\r\nhungry mouths at home which they must feed: and so, having thought it all\r\nwondrously glorious, and quite a fairy land, slips tired and stupid into\r\nbed, and wakes next morning to see the pure light shining in through the\r\ndelicate frost-lace on the window-pane, and looks out over fields of\r\nvirgin snow, and watches the rosy dawn and cloudless blue, and the great\r\nsun rising to the music of cawing rooks and piping stares, and says,\r\n\"This is the true wonder.  This is the true glory.  The theatre last\r\nnight was the fairy land of man; but this is the fairy land of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--THE CHALK-CARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you want to know about next?  More about the caves in which the\r\nold savages lived,--how they were made, and how the curious things inside\r\nthem got there, and so forth.\r\n\r\nWell, we will talk about that in good time: but now--What is that coming\r\ndown the hill?\r\n\r\nOh, only some chalk-carts.\r\n\r\nOnly some chalk-carts?  It seems to me that these chalk-carts are the\r\nvery things we want; that if we follow them far enough--I do not mean\r\nwith our feet along the public road, but with our thoughts along a road\r\nwhich, I am sorry to say, the public do not yet know much about--we shall\r\ncome to a cave, and understand how a cave is made.  Meanwhile, do not be\r\nin a hurry to say, \"Only a chalk-cart,\" or only a mouse, or only a dead\r\nleaf.  Chalk-carts, like mice, and dead leaves, and most other matters in\r\nthe universe are very curious and odd things in the eyes of wise and\r\nreasonable people.  Whenever I hear young men saying \"only\" this and\r\n\"only\" that, I begin to suspect them of belonging, not to the noble army\r\nof sages--much less to the most noble army of martyrs,--but to the\r\nignoble army of noodles, who think nothing interesting or important but\r\ndinners, and balls, and races, and back-biting their neighbours; and I\r\nshould be sorry to see you enlisting in that regiment when you grow up.\r\nBut think--are not chalk-carts very odd and curious things?  I think they\r\nare.  To my mind, it is a curious question how men ever thought of\r\ninventing wheels; and, again, when they first thought of it.  It is a\r\ncurious question, too, how men ever found out that they could make horses\r\nwork for them, and so began to tame them, instead of eating them, and a\r\ncurious question (which I think we shall never get answered) when the\r\nfirst horse-tamer lived, and in what country.  And a very curious, and,\r\nto me, a beautiful sight it is, to see those two noble horses obeying\r\nthat little boy, whom they could kill with a single kick.\r\n\r\nBut, beside all this, there is a question, which ought to be a curious\r\none to you (for I suspect you cannot answer it)--Why does the farmer take\r\nthe trouble to send his cart and horses eight miles and more, to draw in\r\nchalk from Odiham chalk-pit?\r\n\r\nOh, he is going to put it on the land, of course.  They are chalking the\r\nbit at the top of the next field, where the copse was grubbed.\r\n\r\nBut what good will he do by putting chalk on it?  Chalk is not rich and\r\nfertile, like manure, it is altogether poor, barren stuff: you know that,\r\nor ought to know it.  Recollect the chalk cuttings and banks on the\r\nrailway between Basingstoke and Winchester--how utterly barren they are.\r\nThough they have been open these thirty years, not a blade of grass,\r\nhardly a bit of moss, has grown on them, or will grow, perhaps, for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nCome, let us find out something about the chalk before we talk about the\r\ncaves.  The chalk is here, and the caves are not; and \"Learn from the\r\nthing that lies nearest you\" is as good a rule as \"Do the duty which lies\r\nnearest you.\"  Let us come into the grubbed bit, and ask the farmer--there\r\nhe is in his gig.\r\n\r\nWell, old friend, and how are you?  Here is a little boy who wants to\r\nknow why you are putting chalk on your field.\r\n\r\nDoes he then?  If he ever tries to farm round here, he will have to learn\r\nfor his first rule--No chalk, no wheat.\r\n\r\nBut why?\r\n\r\nWhy, is more than I can tell, young squire.  But if you want to see how\r\nit comes about, look here at this freshly-grubbed land--how sour it is.\r\nYou can see that by the colour of it--some black, some red, some green,\r\nsome yellow, all full of sour iron, which will let nothing grow.  After\r\nthe chalk has been on it a year or two, those colours will have all gone\r\nout of it; and it will turn to a nice wholesome brown, like the rest of\r\nthe field; and then you will know that the land is sweet, and fit for any\r\ncrop.  Now do you mind what I tell you, and then I'll tell you something\r\nmore.  We put on the chalk because, beside sweetening the land, it will\r\nhold water.  You see, the land about here, though it is often very wet\r\nfrom springs, is sandy and hungry; and when we drain the bottom water out\r\nof it, the top water (that is, the rain) is apt to run through it too\r\nfast: and then it dries and burns up; and we get no plant of wheat, nor\r\nof turnips either.  So we put on chalk to hold water, and keep the ground\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nBut how can these lumps of chalk hold water?  They are not made like\r\ncups.\r\n\r\nNo: but they are made like sponges, which serves our turn better still.\r\nJust take up that lump, young squire, and you'll see water enough in it,\r\nor rather looking out of it, and staring you in the face.\r\n\r\nWhy! one side of the lump is all over thick ice.\r\n\r\nSo it is.  All that water was inside the chalk last night, till it froze.\r\nAnd then it came squeezing out of the holes in the chalk in strings, as\r\nyou may see it if you break the ice across.  Now you may judge for\r\nyourself how much water a load of chalk will hold, even on a dry summer's\r\nday.  And now, if you'll excuse me, sir, I must be off to market.\r\n\r\nWas it all true that the farmer said?\r\n\r\nQuite true, I believe.  He is not a scientific man--that is, he does not\r\nknow the chemical causes of all these things; but his knowledge is sound\r\nand useful, because it comes from long experience.  He and his\r\nforefathers, perhaps for a thousand years and more, have been farming\r\nthis country, reading Madam How's books with very keen eyes,\r\nexperimenting and watching, very carefully and rationally; making\r\nmistakes often, and failing and losing their crops and their money; but\r\nlearning from their mistakes, till their empiric knowledge, as it is\r\ncalled, helps them to grow sometimes quite as good crops as if they had\r\nlearned agricultural chemistry.\r\n\r\nWhat he meant by the chalk sweetening the land you would not understand\r\nyet, and I can hardly tell you; for chemists are not yet agreed how it\r\nhappens.  But he was right; and right, too, what he told you about the\r\nwater inside the chalk, which is more important to us just now; for, if\r\nwe follow it out, we shall surely come to a cave at last.\r\n\r\nSo now for the water in the chalk.  You can see now why the chalk-downs\r\nat Winchester are always green, even in the hottest summer: because Madam\r\nHow has put under them her great chalk sponge.  The winter rains soak\r\ninto it; and the summer heat draws that rain out of it again as invisible\r\nsteam, coming up from below, to keep the roots of the turf cool and moist\r\nunder the blazing sun.\r\n\r\nYou love that short turf well.  You love to run and race over the Downs\r\nwith your butterfly-net and hunt \"chalk-hill blues,\" and \"marbled\r\nwhites,\" and \"spotted burnets,\" till you are hot and tired; and then to\r\nsit down and look at the quiet little old city below, with the long\r\ncathedral roof, and the tower of St. Cross, and the gray old walls and\r\nbuildings shrouded by noble trees, all embosomed among the soft rounded\r\nlines of the chalk-hills; and then you begin to feel very thirsty, and\r\ncry, \"Oh, if there were but springs and brooks in the Downs, as there are\r\nat home!\"  But all the hollows are as dry as the hill tops.  There is not\r\na brook, or the mark of a watercourse, in one of them.  You are like the\r\nAncient Mariner in the poem, with\r\n\r\n   \"Water, water, every where,\r\n   Nor any drop to drink.\"\r\n\r\nTo get that you must go down and down, hundreds of feet, to the green\r\nmeadows through which silver Itchen glides toward the sea.  There you\r\nstand upon the bridge, and watch the trout in water so crystal-clear that\r\nyou see every weed and pebble as if you looked through air.  If ever\r\nthere was pure water, you think, that is pure.  Is it so?  Drink some.\r\nWash your hands in it and try--You feel that the water is rough, hard (as\r\nthey call it), quite different from the water at home, which feels as\r\nsoft as velvet.  What makes it so hard?\r\n\r\nBecause it is full of invisible chalk.  In every gallon of that water\r\nthere are, perhaps, fifteen grains of solid chalk, which was once inside\r\nthe heart of the hills above.  Day and night, year after year, the chalk\r\ngoes down to the sea; and if there were such creatures as\r\nwater-fairies--if it were true, as the old Greeks and Romans thought,\r\nthat rivers were living things, with a Nymph who dwelt in each of them,\r\nand was its goddess or its queen--then, if your ears were opened to hear\r\nher, the Nymph of Itchen might say to you--\r\n\r\nSo child, you think that I do nothing but, as your sister says when she\r\nsings Mr. Tennyson's beautiful song,\r\n\r\n   \"I chatter over stony ways,\r\n   In little sharps and trebles,\r\n   I bubble into eddying bays,\r\n   I babble on the pebbles.\"\r\n\r\nYes.  I do that: and I love, as the Nymphs loved of old, men who have\r\neyes to see my beauty, and ears to discern my song, and to fit their own\r\nsong to it, and tell how\r\n\r\n   \"'I wind about, and in and out,\r\n   With here a blossom sailing,\r\n   And here and there a lusty trout,\r\n   And here and there a grayling,\r\n\r\n   \"'And here and there a foamy flake\r\n   Upon me, as I travel\r\n   With many a silvery waterbreak\r\n   Above the golden gravel,\r\n\r\n   \"'And draw them all along, and flow\r\n   To join the brimming river,\r\n   For men may come and men may go,\r\n   But I go on for ever.'\"\r\n\r\nYes.  That is all true: but if that were all, I should not be let to flow\r\non for ever, in a world where Lady Why rules, and Madam How obeys.  I\r\nonly exist (like everything else, from the sun in heaven to the gnat\r\nwhich dances in his beam) on condition of working, whether we wish it or\r\nnot, whether we know it or not.  I am not an idle stream, only fit to\r\nchatter to those who bathe or fish in my waters, or even to give poets\r\nbeautiful fancies about me.  You little guess the work I do.  For I am\r\none of the daughters of Madam How, and, like her, work night and day, we\r\nknow not why, though Lady Why must know.  So day by day, and night by\r\nnight, while you are sleeping (for I never sleep), I carry, delicate and\r\nsoft as I am, a burden which giants could not bear: and yet I am never\r\ntired.  Every drop of rain which the south-west wind brings from the West\r\nIndian seas gives me fresh life and strength to bear my burden; and it\r\nhas need to do so; for every drop of rain lays a fresh burden on me.\r\nEvery root and weed which grows in every field; every dead leaf which\r\nfalls in the highwoods of many a parish, from the Grange and Woodmancote\r\nround to Farleigh and Preston, and so to Brighton and the Alresford\r\ndowns;--ay, every atom of manure which the farmers put on the land--foul\r\nenough then, but pure enough before it touches me--each of these, giving\r\noff a tiny atom of what men call carbonic acid, melts a tiny grain of\r\nchalk, and helps to send it down through the solid hill by one of the\r\nmillion pores and veins which at once feed and burden my springs.  Ages\r\non ages I have worked on thus, carrying the chalk into the sea.  And ages\r\non ages, it may be, I shall work on yet; till I have done my work at\r\nlast, and levelled the high downs into a flat sea-shore, with beds of\r\nflint gravel rattling in the shallow waves.\r\n\r\nShe might tell you that; and when she had told you, you would surely\r\nthink of the clumsy chalk-cart rumbling down the hill, and then of the\r\ngraceful stream, bearing silently its invisible load of chalk; and see\r\nhow much more delicate and beautiful, as well as vast and wonderful,\r\nMadam How's work is than that of man.\r\n\r\nBut if you asked the nymph why she worked on for ever, she could not tell\r\nyou.  For like the Nymphs of old, and the Hamadryads who lived, in trees,\r\nand Undine, and the little Sea-maiden, she would have no soul; no reason;\r\nno power to say why.\r\n\r\nIt is for you, who are a reasonable being, to guess why: or at least\r\nlisten to me if I guess for you, and say, perhaps--I can only say\r\nperhaps--that chalk may be going to make layers of rich marl in the sea\r\nbetween England and France; and those marl-beds may be upheaved and grow\r\ninto dry land, and be ploughed, and sowed, and reaped by a wiser race of\r\nmen, in a better-ordered world than this: or the chalk may have even a\r\nnobler destiny before it.  That may happen to it, which has happened\r\nalready to many a grain of lime.  It may be carried thousands of miles\r\naway to help in building up a coral reef (what that is I must tell you\r\nafterwards).  That coral reef may harden into limestone beds.  Those beds\r\nmay be covered up, pressed, and, it may be, heated, till they crystallise\r\ninto white marble: and out of it fairer statues be carved, and grander\r\ntemples built, than the world has ever yet seen.\r\n\r\nAnd if that is not the reason why the chalk is being sent into the sea,\r\nthen there is another reason, and probably a far better one.  For, as I\r\ntold you at first, Lady Why's intentions are far wiser and better than\r\nour fancies; and she--like Him whom she obeys--is able to do exceeding\r\nabundantly, beyond all that we can ask or think.\r\n\r\nBut you will say now that we have followed the chalk-cart a long way,\r\nwithout coming to the cave.\r\n\r\nYou are wrong.  We have come to the very mouth of the cave.  All we have\r\nto do is to say--not \"Open Sesame,\" like Ali Baba in the tale of the\r\nForty Thieves--but some word or two which Madam Why will teach us, and\r\nforthwith a hill will open, and we shall walk in, and behold rivers and\r\ncascades underground, stalactite pillars and stalagmite statues, and all\r\nthe wonders of the grottoes of Adelsberg, Antiparos, or Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAm I joking?  Yes, and yet no; for you know that when I joke I am usually\r\nmost in earnest.  At least, I am now.\r\n\r\nBut there are no caves in chalk?\r\n\r\nNo, not that I ever heard of.  There are, though, in limestone, which is\r\nonly a harder kind of chalk.  Madam How could turn this chalk into hard\r\nlimestone, I believe, even now; and in more ways than one: but in ways\r\nwhich would not be very comfortable or profitable for us Southern folk\r\nwho live on it.  I am afraid that--what between squeezing and heating--she\r\nwould flatten us all out into phosphatic fossils, about an inch thick;\r\nand turn Winchester city into a \"breccia\" which would puzzle geologists a\r\nhundred thousand years hence.  So we will hope that she will leave our\r\nchalk downs for the Itchen to wash gently away, while we talk about\r\ncaves, and how Madam How scoops them out by water underground, just in\r\nthe same way, only more roughly, as she melts the chalk.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, that these hills, instead of being soft, spongy chalk,\r\nwere all hard limestone marble, like that of which the font in the church\r\nis made.  Then the rainwater, instead of sinking through the chalk as\r\nnow, would run over the ground down-hill, and if it came to a crack (a\r\nfault, as it is called) it would run down between the rock; and as it ran\r\nit would eat that hole wider and wider year by year, and make a swallow-\r\nhole--such as you may see in plenty if you ever go up Whernside, or any\r\nof the high hills in Yorkshire--unfathomable pits in the green turf, in\r\nwhich you may hear the water tinkling and trickling far, far underground.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before we go a step farther, you may understand, why the bones\r\nof animals are so often found in limestone caves.  Down such\r\nswallow-holes how many beasts must fall: either in hurry and fright, when\r\nhunted by lions and bears and such cruel beasts; or more often still in\r\ntime of snow, when the holes are covered with drift; or, again, if they\r\ndied on the open hill-sides, their bones might be washed in, in floods,\r\nalong with mud and stones, and buried with them in the cave below; and\r\nbeside that, lions and bears and hyaenas might live in the caves below,\r\nas we know they did in some caves, and drag in bones through the caves'\r\nmouths; or, again, savages might live in that cave, and bring in animals\r\nto eat, like the wild beasts; and so those bones might be mixed up, as we\r\nknow they were, with things which the savages had left behind--like flint\r\ntools or beads; and then the whole would be hardened, by the dripping of\r\nthe limestone water, into a paste of breccia just like this in my drawer.\r\nBut the bones of the savages themselves you would seldom or never find\r\nmixed in it--unless some one had fallen in by accident from above.  And\r\nwhy?  (For there is a Why? to that question: and not merely a How?)\r\nSimply because they were men; and because God has put into the hearts of\r\nall men, even of the lowest savages, some sort of reverence for those who\r\nare gone; and has taught them to bury, or in some other way take care of,\r\ntheir bones.\r\n\r\nBut how is the swallow-hole sure to end in a cave?\r\n\r\nBecause it cannot help making a cave for itself if it has time.\r\n\r\nThink: and you will see that it must be so.  For that water must run\r\nsomewhere; and so it eats its way out between the beds of the rock,\r\nmaking underground galleries, and at last caves and lofty halls.  For it\r\nalways eats, remember, at the bottom of its channel, leaving the roof\r\nalone.  So it eats, and eats, more in some places and less in others,\r\naccording as the stone is harder or softer, and according to the\r\ndifferent direction of the rock-beds (what we call their dip and strike);\r\ntill at last it makes one of those wonderful caverns about which you are\r\nso fond of reading--such a cave as there actually is in the rocks of the\r\nmountain of Whernside, fed by the swallow-holes around the mountain-top;\r\na cave hundreds of yards long, with halls, and lakes, and waterfalls, and\r\ncurtains and festoons of stalactite which have dripped from the roof, and\r\npillars of stalagmite which have been built up on the floor below.  These\r\nstalactites (those tell me who have seen them) are among the most\r\nbeautiful of all Madam How's work; sometimes like branches of roses or of\r\ngrapes; sometimes like statues; sometimes like delicate curtains, and I\r\nknow not what other beautiful shapes.  I have never seen them, I am sorry\r\nto say, and therefore I cannot describe them.  But they are all made in\r\nthe same way; just in the same way as those little straight stalactites\r\nwhich you may have seen hanging, like icicles, in vaulted cellars, or\r\nunder the arches of a bridge.  The water melts more lime than it can\r\ncarry, and drops some of it again, making fresh limestone grain by grain\r\nas it drips from the roof above; and fresh limestone again where it\r\nsplashes on the floor below: till if it dripped long enough, the\r\nstalactite hanging from above would meet the stalagmite rising from\r\nbelow, and join in one straight round white graceful shaft, which would\r\nseem (but only seem) to support the roof of the cave.  And out of that\r\ncave--though not always out of the mouth of it--will run a stream of\r\nwater, which seems to you clear as crystal, though it is actually, like\r\nthe Itchen at Winchester, full of lime; so full of lime, that it makes\r\nbeds of fresh limestone, which are called travertine--which you may see\r\nin Italy, and Greece, and Asia Minor: or perhaps it petrifies, as you\r\ncall it, the weeds in its bed, like that dropping-well at Knaresborough,\r\nof which you have often seen a picture.  And the cause is this: the water\r\nis so full of lime, that it is forced to throw away some of it upon\r\neverything it touches, and so incrusts with stone--though it does not\r\nturn to stone--almost anything you put in it.  You have seen, or ought to\r\nhave seen, petrified moss and birds' nests and such things from\r\nKnaresborough Well: and now you know a little, though only a very little,\r\nof how the pretty toys are made.\r\n\r\nNow if you can imagine for yourself (though I suppose a little boy\r\ncannot) the amount of lime which one of these subterranean rivers would\r\ncarry away, gnawing underground centuries after centuries, day and night,\r\nsummer and winter, then you will not be surprised at the enormous size of\r\ncaverns which may be seen in different parts of the world--but always, I\r\nbelieve, in limestone rock.  You would not be surprised (though you would\r\nadmire them) at the caverns of Adelsberg, in Carniola (in the south of\r\nAustria, near the top of the Adriatic), which runs, I believe, for miles\r\nin length; and in the lakes of which, in darkness from its birth until\r\nits death, lives that strange beast, the Proteus a sort of long newt\r\nwhich never comes to perfection--I suppose for want of the genial\r\nsunlight which makes all things grow.  But he is blind; and more, he\r\nkeeps all his life the same feathery gills which newts have when they are\r\nbabies, and which we have so often looked at through the microscope, to\r\nsee the blood-globules run round and round inside.  You would not wonder,\r\neither, at the Czirknitz Lake, near the same place, which at certain\r\ntimes of the year vanishes suddenly through chasms under water, sucking\r\nthe fish down with it; and after a certain time boils suddenly up again\r\nfrom the depths, bringing back with it the fish, who have been swimming\r\ncomfortably all the time in a subterranean lake; and bringing back, too\r\n(and, extraordinary as this story is, there is good reason to believe it\r\ntrue), live wild ducks who went down small and unfledged, and come back\r\nfull-grown and fat, with water-weeds and small fish in their stomachs,\r\nshowing they have had plenty to feed on underground.  But--and this is\r\nthe strangest part of the story, if true--they come up unfledged just as\r\nthey went down, and are moreover blind from having been so long in\r\ndarkness.  After a while, however, folks say their eyes get right, their\r\nfeathers grow, and they fly away like other birds.\r\n\r\nNeither would you be surprised (if you recollect that Madam How is a very\r\nold lady indeed, and that some of her work is very old likewise) at that\r\nMammoth Cave in Kentucky, the largest cave in the known world, through\r\nwhich you may walk nearly ten miles on end, and in which a hundred miles\r\nof gallery have been explored already, and yet no end found to the cave.\r\nIn it (the guides will tell you) there are \"226 avenues, 47 domes, 8\r\ncataracts, 23 pits, and several rivers;\" and if that fact is not very\r\ninteresting to you (as it certainly is not to me) I will tell you\r\nsomething which ought to interest you: that this cave is so immensely old\r\nthat various kinds of little animals, who have settled themselves in the\r\nouter parts of it, have had time to change their shape, and to become\r\nquite blind; so that blind fathers and mothers have blind children,\r\ngeneration after generation.\r\n\r\nThere are blind rats there, with large shining eyes which cannot\r\nsee--blind landcrabs, who have the foot-stalks of their eyes (you may see\r\nthem in any crab) still left; but the eyes which should be on the top of\r\nthem are gone.  There are blind fish, too, in the cave, and blind\r\ninsects; for, if they have no use for their eyes in the dark, why should\r\nMadam How take the trouble to finish them off?\r\n\r\nOne more cave I must tell you of, to show you how old some caves must be,\r\nand then I must stop; and that is the cave of Caripe, in Venezuela, which\r\nis the most northerly part of South America.  There, in the face of a\r\nlimestone cliff, crested with enormous flowering trees, and festooned\r\nwith those lovely creepers of which you have seen a few small ones in\r\nhothouses, there opens an arch as big as the west front of Winchester\r\nCathedral, and runs straight in like a cathedral nave for more than 1400\r\nfeet.  Out of it runs a stream; and along the banks of that stream, as\r\nfar as the sunlight strikes in, grow wild bananas, and palms, and lords\r\nand ladies (as you call them), which are not, like ours, one foot, but\r\nmany feet high.  Beyond that the cave goes on, with subterranean streams,\r\ncascades, and halls, no man yet knows how far.  A friend of mine last\r\nyear went in farther, I believe, than any one yet has gone; but, instead\r\nof taking Indian torches made of bark and resin, or even torches made of\r\nSpanish wax, such as a brave bishop of those parts used once when he went\r\nin farther than any one before him, he took with him some of that\r\nbeautiful magnesium light which you have seen often here at home.  And in\r\none place, when he lighted up the magnesium, he found himself in a hall\r\nfull 300 feet high--higher far, that is, than the dome of St. Paul's--and\r\na very solemn thought it was to him, he said, that he had seen what no\r\nother human being ever had seen; and that no ray of light had ever struck\r\non that stupendous roof in all the ages since the making of the world.\r\nBut if he found out something which he did not expect, he was\r\ndisappointed in something which he did expect.  For the Indians warned\r\nhim of a hole in the floor which (they told him) was an unfathomable\r\nabyss.  And lo and behold, when he turned the magnesium light upon it,\r\nthe said abyss was just about eight feet deep.  But it is no wonder that\r\nthe poor Indians with their little smoky torches should make such\r\nmistakes; no wonder, too, that they should be afraid to enter far into\r\nthose gloomy vaults; that they should believe that the souls of their\r\nancestors live in that dark cave; and that they should say that when they\r\ndie they will go to the Guacharos, as they call the birds that fly with\r\ndoleful screams out of the cave to feed at night, and in again at\r\ndaylight, to roost and sleep.\r\n\r\nNow, it is these very Guacharo birds which are to me the most wonderful\r\npart of the story.  The Indians kill and eat them for their fat, although\r\nthey believe they have to do with evil spirits.  But scientific men who\r\nhave studied these birds will tell you that they are more wonderful than\r\nif all the Indians' fancies about them were true.  They are great birds,\r\nmore than three feet across the wings, somewhat like owls, somewhat like\r\ncuckoos, somewhat like goatsuckers; but, on the whole, unlike anything in\r\nthe world but themselves; and instead of feeding on moths or mice, they\r\nfeed upon hard dry fruits, which they pick off the trees after the set of\r\nsun.  And wise men will tell you, that in making such a bird as that, and\r\ngiving it that peculiar way of life, and settling it in that cavern, and\r\na few more caverns in that part of the world, and therefore in making the\r\ncaverns ready for them to live in, Madam How must have taken ages and\r\nages, more than you can imagine or count.\r\n\r\nBut that is among the harder lessons which come in the latter part of\r\nMadam How's book.  Children need not learn them yet; and they can never\r\nlearn them, unless they master her alphabet, and her short and easy\r\nlessons for beginners, some of which I am trying to teach you now.\r\n\r\nBut I have just recollected that we are a couple of very stupid fellows.\r\nWe have been talking all this time about chalk and limestone, and have\r\nforgotten to settle what they are, and how they were made.  We must think\r\nof that next time.  It will not do for us (at least if we mean to be\r\nscientific men) to use terms without defining them; in plain English, to\r\ntalk about--we don't know what.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--MADAM HOW'S TWO GRANDSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou want to know, then, what chalk is?  I suppose you mean what chalk is\r\nmade of?\r\n\r\nYes.  That is it.\r\n\r\nThat we can only help by calling in the help of a very great giant whose\r\nname is Analysis.\r\n\r\nA giant?\r\n\r\nYes.  And before we call for him I will tell you a very curious story\r\nabout him and his younger brother, which is every word of it true.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, certainly as long ago as the first man, or perhaps the\r\nfirst rational being of any kind, was created, Madam How had two\r\ngrandsons.  The elder is called Analysis, and the younger Synthesis.  As\r\nfor who their father and mother were, there have been so many disputes on\r\nthat question that I think children may leave it alone for the present.\r\nFor my part, I believe that they are both, like St. Patrick, \"gentlemen,\r\nand come of decent people;\" and I have a great respect and affection for\r\nthem both, as long as each keeps in his own place and minds his own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nNow you must understand that, as soon as these two baby giants were born,\r\nLady Why, who sets everything to do that work for which it is exactly\r\nfitted, set both of them their work.  Analysis was to take to pieces\r\neverything he found, and find out how it was made.  Synthesis was to put\r\nthe pieces together again, and make something fresh out of them.  In a\r\nword, Analysis was to teach men Science; and Synthesis to teach them Art.\r\n\r\nBut because Analysis was the elder, Madam How commanded Synthesis never\r\nto put the pieces together till Analysis had taken them completely apart.\r\nAnd, my child, if Synthesis had obeyed that rule of his good old\r\ngrandmother's, the world would have been far happier, wealthier, wiser,\r\nand better than it is now.\r\n\r\nBut Synthesis would not.  He grew up a very noble boy.  He could carve,\r\nhe could paint, he could build, he could make music, and write poems: but\r\nhe was full of conceit and haste.  Whenever his elder brother tried to do\r\na little patient work in taking things to pieces, Synthesis snatched the\r\nwork out of his hands before it was a quarter done, and began putting it\r\ntogether again to suit his own fancy, and, of course, put it together\r\nwrong.  Then he went on to bully his elder brother, and locked him up in\r\nprison, and starved him, till for many hundred years poor Analysis never\r\ngrew at all, but remained dwarfed, and stupid, and all but blind for want\r\nof light; while Synthesis, and all the hasty conceited people who\r\nfollowed him, grew stout and strong and tyrannous, and overspread the\r\nwhole world, and ruled it at their will.  But the fault of all the work\r\nof Synthesis was just this: that it would not work.  His watches would\r\nnot keep time, his soldiers would not fight, his ships would not sail,\r\nhis houses would not keep the rain out.  So every time he failed in his\r\nwork he had to go to poor Analysis in his dungeon, and bully him into\r\ntaking a thing or two to pieces, and giving him a few sound facts out of\r\nthem, just to go on with till he came to grief again, boasting in the\r\nmeantime that he and not Analysis had found out the facts.  And at last\r\nhe grew so conceited that he fancied he knew all that Madam How could\r\nteach him, or Lady Why either, and that he understood all things in\r\nheaven and earth; while it was not the real heaven and earth that he was\r\nthinking of, but a sham heaven and a sham earth, which he had built up\r\nout of his guesses and his own fancies.\r\n\r\nAnd the more Synthesis waxed in pride, and the more he trampled upon his\r\npoor brother, the more reckless he grew, and the more willing to deceive\r\nhimself.  If his real flowers would not grow, he cut out paper flowers,\r\nand painted them and said that they would do just as well as natural\r\nones.  If his dolls would not work, he put strings and wires behind them\r\nto make them nod their heads and open their eyes, and then persuaded\r\nother people, and perhaps half-persuaded himself, that they were alive.\r\nIf the hand of his weather-glass went down, he nailed it up to insure a\r\nfine day, and tortured, burnt, or murdered every one who said it did not\r\nkeep up of itself.  And many other foolish and wicked things he did,\r\nwhich little boys need not hear of yet.\r\n\r\nBut at last his punishment came, according to the laws of his\r\ngrandmother, Madam How, which are like the laws of the Medes and\r\nPersians, and alter not, as you and all mankind will sooner or later\r\nfind; for he grew so rich and powerful that he grew careless and lazy,\r\nand thought about nothing but eating and drinking, till people began to\r\ndespise him more and more.  And one day he left the dungeon of Analysis\r\nso ill guarded, that Analysis got out and ran away.  Great was the hue\r\nand cry after him; and terribly would he have been punished had he been\r\ncaught.  But, lo and behold, folks had grown so disgusted with Synthesis\r\nthat they began to take the part of Analysis.  Poor men hid him in their\r\ncottages, and scholars in their studies.  And when war arose about\r\nhim,--and terrible wars did arise,--good kings, wise statesmen, gallant\r\nsoldiers, spent their treasure and their lives in fighting for him.  All\r\nhonest folk welcomed him, because he was honest; and all wise folk used\r\nhim, for, instead of being a conceited tyrant like Synthesis, he showed\r\nhimself the most faithful, diligent, humble of servants, ready to do\r\nevery man's work, and answer every man's questions.  And among them all\r\nhe got so well fed that he grew very shortly into the giant that he ought\r\nto have been all along; and was, and will be for many a year to come,\r\nperfectly able to take care of himself.\r\n\r\nAs for poor Synthesis, he really has fallen so low in these days, that\r\none cannot but pity him.  He now goes about humbly after his brother,\r\nfeeding on any scraps that are thrown to him, and is snubbed and rapped\r\nover the knuckles, and told one minute to hold his tongue and mind his\r\nown business, and the next that he has no business at all to mind, till\r\nhe has got into such a poor way that some folks fancy he will die, and\r\nare actually digging his grave already, and composing his epitaph.  But\r\nthey are trying to wear the bear's skin before the bear is killed; for\r\nSynthesis is not dead, nor anything like it; and he will rise up again\r\nsome day, to make good friends with his brother Analysis, and by his help\r\ndo nobler and more beautiful work than he has ever yet done in the world.\r\n\r\nSo now Analysis has got the upper hand; so much so that he is in danger\r\nof being spoilt by too much prosperity, as his brother was before him; in\r\nwhich case he too will have his fall; and a great deal of good it will do\r\nhim.  And that is the end of my story, and a true story it is.\r\n\r\nNow you must remember, whenever you have to do with him, that Analysis,\r\nlike fire, is a very good servant, but a very bad master.  For, having\r\ngot his freedom only of late years or so, he is, like young men when they\r\ncome suddenly to be their own masters, apt to be conceited, and to fancy\r\nthat he knows everything, when really he knows nothing, and can never\r\nknow anything, but only knows about things, which is a very different\r\nmatter.  Indeed, nowadays he pretends that he can teach his old\r\ngrandmother, Madam How, not only how to suck eggs, but to make eggs into\r\nthe bargain; while the good old lady just laughs at him kindly, and lets\r\nhim run on, because she knows he will grow wiser in time, and learn\r\nhumility by his mistakes and failures, as I hope you will from yours.\r\n\r\nHowever, Analysis is a very clever young giant, and can do wonderful work\r\nas long as he meddles only with dead things, like this bit of lime.  He\r\ncan take it to pieces, and tell you of what things it is made, or seems\r\nto be made; and take them to pieces again, and tell you what each of them\r\nis made of; and so on, till he gets conceited, and fancies that he can\r\nfind out some one Thing of all things (which he calls matter), of which\r\nall other things are made; and some Way of all ways (which he calls\r\nforce), by which all things are made: but when he boasts in that way, old\r\nMadam How smiles, and says, \"My child, before you can say that, you must\r\nremember a hundred things which you are forgetting, and learn a hundred\r\nthousand things which you do not know;\" and then she just puts her hand\r\nover his eyes, and Master Analysis begins groping in the dark, and\r\ntalking the saddest nonsense.  So beware of him, and keep him in his own\r\nplace, and to his own work, or he will flatter you, and get the mastery\r\nof you, and persuade you that he can teach you a thousand things of which\r\nhe knows no more than he does why a duck's egg never hatches into a\r\nchicken.  And remember, if Master Analysis ever grows saucy and conceited\r\nwith you, just ask him that last riddle, and you will shut him up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nAnd why?\r\n\r\nBecause Analysis can only explain to you a little about dead things, like\r\nstones--inorganic things as they are called.  Living things--organisms,\r\nas they are called--he cannot explain to you at all.  When he meddles\r\nwith them, he always ends like the man who killed his goose to get the\r\ngolden eggs.  He has to kill his goose, or his flower, or his insect,\r\nbefore he can analyse it; and then it is not a goose, but only the corpse\r\nof a goose; not a flower, but only the dead stuff of the flower.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore he will never do anything but fail, when he tries to find\r\nout the life in things.  How can he, when he has to take the life out of\r\nthem first?  He could not even find out how a plum-pudding is made by\r\nmerely analysing it.  He might part the sugar, and the flour, and the\r\nsuet; he might even (for he is very clever, and very patient too, the\r\nmore honour to him) take every atom of sugar out of the flour with which\r\nit had got mixed, and every atom of brown colour which had got out of the\r\nplums and currants into the body of the pudding, and then, for aught I\r\nknow, put the colouring matter back again into the plums and currants;\r\nand then, for aught I know, turn the boiled pudding into a raw one\r\nagain,--for he is a great conjurer, as Madam How's grandson is bound to\r\nbe: but yet he would never find out how the pudding was made, unless some\r\none told him the great secret which the sailors in the old story\r\nforgot--that the cook boiled it in a cloth.\r\n\r\nThis is Analysis's weak point--don't let it be yours--that in all his\r\ncalculations he is apt to forget the cloth, and indeed the cook likewise.\r\nNo doubt he can analyse the matter of things: but he will keep forgetting\r\nthat he cannot analyse their form.\r\n\r\nDo I mean their shape?\r\n\r\nNo, my child; no.  I mean something which makes the shape of things, and\r\nthe matter of them likewise, but which folks have lost sight of nowadays,\r\nand do not seem likely to get sight of again for a few hundred years.  So\r\nI suppose that you need not trouble your head about it, but may just\r\nfollow the fashions as long as they last.\r\n\r\nAbout this piece of lime, however, Analysis can tell us a great deal.  And\r\nwe may trust what he says, and believe that he understands what he says.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nThink now.  If you took your watch to pieces, you would probably spoil it\r\nfor ever; you would have perhaps broken, and certainly mislaid, some of\r\nthe bits; and not even a watchmaker could put it together again.  You\r\nwould have analysed the watch wrongly.  But if a watchmaker took it to\r\npieces then any other watchmaker could put it together again to go as\r\nwell as ever, because they both understand the works, how they fit into\r\neach other, and what the use and the power of each is.  Its being put\r\ntogether again rightly would be a proof that it had been taken to pieces\r\nrightly.\r\n\r\nAnd so with Master Analysis.  If he can take a thing to pieces so that\r\nhis brother Synthesis can put it together again, you may be sure that he\r\nhas done his work rightly.\r\n\r\nNow he can take a bit of chalk to pieces, so that it shall become several\r\ndifferent things, none of which is chalk, or like chalk at all.  And then\r\nhis brother Synthesis can put them together again, so that they shall\r\nbecome chalk, as they were before.  He can do that very nearly, but not\r\nquite.  There is, in every average piece of chalk, something which he\r\ncannot make into chalk again when he has once unmade it.\r\n\r\nWhat that is I will show you presently; and a wonderful tale hangs\r\nthereby.  But first we will let Analysis tell us what chalk is made of,\r\nas far as he knows.\r\n\r\nHe will say--Chalk is carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nBut what is carbonate of lime made of?\r\n\r\nLime and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nAnd what is lime?\r\n\r\nThe oxide of a certain metal, called calcium.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nThat quicklime is a certain metal mixed with oxygen gas; and slacked lime\r\nis the same, mixed with water.\r\n\r\nSo lime is a metal.  What is a metal?  Nobody knows.\r\n\r\nAnd what is oxygen gas?  Nobody knows.\r\n\r\nWell, Analysis, stops short very soon.  He does not seem to know much\r\nabout the matter.\r\n\r\nNay, nay, you are wrong there.  It is just \"about the matter\" that he\r\ndoes know, and knows a great deal, and very accurately; what he does not\r\nknow is the matter itself.  He will tell you wonderful things about\r\noxygen gas--how the air is full of it, the water full of it, every living\r\nthing full of it; how it changes hard bright steel into soft, foul rust;\r\nhow a candle cannot burn without it, or you live without it.  But what it\r\nis he knows not.\r\n\r\nWill he ever know?\r\n\r\nThat is Lady Why's concern, and not ours.  Meanwhile he has a right to\r\nfind out if he can.  But what do you want to ask him next?\r\n\r\nWhat?  Oh!  What carbonic acid is.  He can tell you that.  Carbon and\r\noxygen gas.\r\n\r\nBut what is carbon?\r\n\r\nNobody knows.\r\n\r\nWhy, here is this stupid Analysis at fault again.\r\n\r\nNay, nay, again.  Be patient with him.  If he cannot tell you what carbon\r\nis, he can tell you what is carbon, which is well worth knowing.  He will\r\ntell you, for instance, that every time you breathe or speak, what comes\r\nout of your mouth is carbonic acid; and that, if your breath comes on a\r\nbit of slacked lime, it will begin to turn it back into the chalk from\r\nwhich it was made; and that, if your breath comes on the leaves of a\r\ngrowing plant, that leaf will take the carbon out of it, and turn it into\r\nwood.  And surely that is worth knowing,--that you may be helping to make\r\nchalk, or to make wood, every time you breathe.\r\n\r\nWell; that is very curious.\r\n\r\nBut now, ask him, What is carbon?  And he will tell you, that many things\r\nare carbon.  A diamond is carbon; and so is blacklead; and so is charcoal\r\nand coke, and coal in part, and wood in part.\r\n\r\nWhat?  Does Analysis say that a diamond and charcoal are the same thing?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThen his way of taking things to pieces must be a very clumsy one, if he\r\ncan find out no difference between diamond and charcoal.\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps it is: but you must remember that, though he is very old--as\r\nold as the first man who ever lived--he has only been at school for the\r\nlast three hundred years or so.  And remember, too, that he is not like\r\nyou, who have some one else to teach you.  He has had to teach himself,\r\nand find out for himself, and make his own tools, and work in the dark\r\nbesides.  And I think it is very much to his credit that he ever found\r\nout that diamond and charcoal were the same things.  You would never have\r\nfound it out for yourself, you will agree.\r\n\r\nNo: but how did he do it?\r\n\r\nHe taught a very famous chemist, Lavoisier, about ninety years ago, how\r\nto burn a diamond in oxygen--and a very difficult trick that is; and\r\nLavoisier found that the diamond when burnt turned almost entirely into\r\ncarbonic acid and water, as blacklead and charcoal do; and more, that\r\neach of them turned into the same quantity of carbonic acid, And so he\r\nknew, as surely as man can know anything, that all these things, however\r\ndifferent to our eyes and fingers, are really made of the same\r\nthing,--pure carbon.\r\n\r\nBut what makes them look and feel so different?\r\n\r\nThat Analysis does not know yet.  Perhaps he will find out some day; for\r\nhe is very patient, and very diligent, as you ought to be.  Meanwhile, be\r\ncontent with him: remember that though he cannot see through a milestone\r\nyet, he can see farther into one than his neighbours.  Indeed his\r\nneighbours cannot see into a milestone at all, but only see the outside\r\nof it, and know things only by rote, like parrots, without understanding\r\nwhat they mean and how they are made.\r\n\r\nSo now remember that chalk is carbonate of lime, and that it is made up\r\nof three things, calcium, oxygen, and carbon; and that therefore its mark\r\nis CaCO(3), in Analysis's language, which I hope you will be able to read\r\nsome day.\r\n\r\nBut how is it that Analysis and Synthesis cannot take all this chalk to\r\npieces, and put it together again?\r\n\r\nLook here; what is that in the chalk?\r\n\r\nOh! a shepherd's crown, such as we often find in the gravel, only fresh\r\nand white.\r\n\r\nWell; you know what that was once.  I have often told you:--a live sea-\r\negg, covered with prickles, which crawls at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nWell, I am sure that Master Synthesis could not put that together again:\r\nand equally sure that Master Analysis might spend ages in taking it to\r\npieces, before he found out how it was made.  And--we are lucky to-day,\r\nfor this lower chalk to the south has very few fossils in it--here is\r\nsomething else which is not mere carbonate of lime.  Look at it.\r\n\r\nA little cockle, something like a wrinkled hazel-nut.\r\n\r\nNo; that is no cockle.  Madam How invented that ages and ages before she\r\nthought of cockles, and the animal which lived inside that shell was as\r\ndifferent from a cockle-animal as a sparrow is from a dog.  That is a\r\nTerebratula, a gentleman of a very ancient and worn-out family.  He and\r\nhis kin swarmed in the old seas, even as far back as the time when the\r\nrocks of the Welsh mountains were soft mud; as you will know when you\r\nread that great book of Sir Roderick Murchison's, _Siluria_.  But as the\r\nages rolled on, they got fewer and fewer, these Terebratulae; and now\r\nthere are hardly any of them left; only six or seven sorts are left about\r\nthese islands, which cling to stones in deep water; and the first time I\r\ndredged two of them out of Loch Fyne, I looked at them with awe, as on\r\nrelics from another world, which had lasted on through unnumbered ages\r\nand changes, such as one's fancy could not grasp.\r\n\r\nBut you will agree that, if Master Analysis took that shell to pieces,\r\nMaster Synthesis would not be likely to put it together again; much less\r\nto put it together in the right way, in which Madam How made it.\r\n\r\nAnd what was that?\r\n\r\nBy making a living animal, which went on growing, that is, making itself;\r\nand making, as it grew, its shell to live in.  Synthesis has not found\r\nout yet the first step towards doing that; and, as I believe, he never\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nBut there would be no harm in his trying?\r\n\r\nOf course not.  Let everybody try to do everything they fancy.  Even if\r\nthey fail, they will have learnt at least that they cannot do it.\r\n\r\nBut now--and this is a secret which you would never find out for\r\nyourself, at least without the help of a microscope--the greater part of\r\nthis lump of chalk is made up of things which neither Analysis can\r\nperfectly take to pieces, nor Synthesis put together again.  It is made\r\nof dead organisms, that is, things which have been made by living\r\ncreatures.  If you washed and brushed that chalk into powder, you would\r\nfind it full of little things like the Dentalina in this drawing, and\r\nmany other curious forms.  I will show you some under the microscope one\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThey are the shells of animals called Foraminifera, because the shells of\r\nsome of them are full of holes, through which they put out tiny arms.  So\r\nsmall they are and so many, that there may be, it is said, forty thousand\r\nof them in a bit of chalk an inch every way.  In numbers past counting,\r\nsome whole, some broken, some ground to the finest powder, they make up\r\nvast masses of England, which are now chalk downs; and in some foreign\r\ncountries they make up whole mountains.  Part of the building stone of\r\nthe Great Pyramid in Egypt is composed, I am told, entirely of them.\r\n\r\nAnd how did they get into the chalk?\r\n\r\nAh!  How indeed?  Let us think.  The chalk must have been laid down at\r\nthe bottom of a sea, because there are sea-shells in it.  Besides, we\r\nfind little atomies exactly like these alive now in many seas; and\r\ntherefore it is fair to suppose these lived in the sea also.\r\n\r\nBesides, they were not washed into the chalk by any sudden flood.  The\r\nwater in which they settled must have been quite still, or these little\r\ndelicate creatures would have been ground into powder--or rather into\r\npaste.  Therefore learned men soon made up their minds that these things\r\nwere laid down at the bottom of a deep sea, so deep that neither wind,\r\nnor tide, nor currents could stir the everlasting calm.\r\n\r\nAh! it is worth thinking over, for it shows how shrewd a giant Analysis\r\nis, and how fast he works in these days, now that he has got free and\r\nwell fed;--worth thinking over, I say, how our notions about these little\r\natomies have changed during the last forty years.\r\n\r\nWe used to find them sometimes washed up among the sea-sand on the wild\r\nAtlantic coast; and we were taught, in the days when old Dr. Turton was\r\nwriting his book on British shells at Bideford, to call them Nautili,\r\nbecause their shells were like Nautilus shells.  Men did not know then\r\nthat the animal which lives in them is no more like a Nautilus animal\r\nthan it is like a cow.\r\n\r\nFor a Nautilus, you must know, is made like a cuttlefish, with eyes, and\r\nstrong jaws for biting, and arms round them; and has a heart, and gills,\r\nand a stomach; and is altogether a very well-made beast, and, I suspect,\r\na terrible tyrant to little fish and sea-slugs, just as the cuttlefish\r\nis.  But the creatures which live in these little shells are about the\r\nleast finished of Madam How's works.  They have neither mouth nor\r\nstomach, eyes nor limbs.  They are mere live bags full of jelly, which\r\ncan take almost any shape they like, and thrust out arms--or what serve\r\nfor arms--through the holes in their shells, and then contract them into\r\nthemselves again, as this Globigerina does.  What they feed on, how they\r\ngrow, how they make their exquisitely-formed shells, whether, indeed,\r\nthey are, strictly speaking, animals or vegetables, Analysis has not yet\r\nfound out.  But when you come to read about them, you will find that\r\nthey, in their own way, are just as wonderful and mysterious as a\r\nbutterfly or a rose; and just as necessary, likewise, to Madam How's\r\nwork; for out of them, as I told you, she makes whole sheets of down,\r\nwhole ranges of hills.\r\n\r\nNo one knew anything, I believe, about them, save that two or three kinds\r\nof them were found in chalk, till a famous Frenchman, called D'Orbigny,\r\njust thirty years ago, told the world how he had found many beautiful\r\nfresh kinds; and, more strange still, that some of these kinds were still\r\nalive at the bottom of the Adriatic, and of the harbour of Alexandria, in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nThen in 1841 a gentleman named Edward Forbes,--now with God--whose name\r\nwill be for ever dear to all who love science, and honour genius and\r\nvirtue,--found in the AEgean Sea \"a bed of chalk,\" he said, \"full of\r\nForaminifera, and shells of Pteropods,\" forming at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd what are Pteropods?\r\n\r\nWhat you might call sea-moths (though they are not really moths), which\r\nswim about on the surface of the water, while the right-whales suck them\r\nin tens of thousands into the great whalebone net which fringes their\r\njaws.  Here are drawings of them.  1. Limacina (on which the whales\r\nfeed); and 2. Hyalea, a lovely little thing in a glass shell, which lives\r\nin the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nBut since then strange discoveries have been made, especially by the\r\nnaval officers who surveyed the bottom of the great Atlantic Ocean before\r\nlaying down the electric cable between Ireland and America.  And this is\r\nwhat they found:\r\n\r\nThat at the bottom of the Atlantic were vast plains of soft mud, in some\r\nplaces 2500 fathoms (15,000 feet) deep; that is, as deep as the Alps are\r\nhigh.  And more: they found out, to their surprise, that the oozy mud of\r\nthe Atlantic floor was made up almost entirely of just the same atomies\r\nas make up our chalk, especially globigerinas; that, in fact, a vast bed\r\nof chalk was now forming at the bottom of the Atlantic, with living\r\nshells and sea-animals of the most brilliant colours crawling about on it\r\nin black darkness, and beds of sponges growing out of it, just as the\r\nsponges grew at the bottom of the old chalk ocean, and were all,\r\ngeneration after generation, turned into flints.\r\n\r\nAnd, for reasons which you will hardly understand, men are beginning now\r\nto believe that the chalk has never ceased to be made, somewhere or\r\nother, for many thousand years, ever since the Winchester Downs were at\r\nthe bottom of the sea: and that \"the Globigerina-mud is not merely _a_\r\nchalk formation, but a continuation of _the_ chalk formation, so _that we\r\nmay be said to be still living in the age of Chalk_.\" {1}  Ah, my little\r\nman, what would I not give to see you, before I die, add one such thought\r\nas that to the sum of human knowledge!\r\n\r\nSo there the little creatures have been lying, making chalk out of the\r\nlime in the sea-water, layer over layer, the young over the old, the dead\r\nover the living, year after year, age after age--for how long?\r\n\r\nWho can tell?  How deep the layer of new chalk at the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic is, we can never know.  But the layer of live atomies on it is\r\nnot an inch thick, probably not a tenth of an inch.  And if it grew a\r\ntenth of an inch a year, or even a whole inch, how many years must it\r\nhave taken to make the chalk of our downs, which is in some parts 1300\r\nfeet thick?  How many inches are there in 1300 feet?  Do that sum, and\r\njudge for yourself.\r\n\r\nOne difference will be found between the chalk now forming at the bottom\r\nof the ocean, if it ever become dry land, and the chalk on which you\r\ntread on the downs.  The new chalk will be full of the teeth and bones of\r\nwhales--warm-blooded creatures, who suckle their young like cows, instead\r\nof laying eggs, like birds and fish.  For there were no whales in the old\r\nchalk ocean; but our modern oceans are full of cachalots, porpoises,\r\ndolphins, swimming in shoals round any ship; and their bones and teeth,\r\nand still more their ear-bones, will drop to the bottom as they die, and\r\nbe found, ages hence, in the mud which the live atomies make, along with\r\nwrecks of mighty ships\r\n\r\n   \"Great anchors, heaps of pearl,\"\r\n\r\nand all that man has lost in the deep seas.  And sadder fossils yet, my\r\nchild, will be scattered on those white plains:--\r\n\r\n   \"To them the love of woman hath gone down,\r\n   Dark roll their waves o'er manhood's noble head.\r\n   O'er youth's bright locks, and beauty's flowing crown;\r\n   Yet shall they hear a voice, 'Restore the dead.'\r\n   Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee.\r\n   Give back the dead, thou Sea!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--THE CORAL-REEF\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you want to know what I meant when I talked of a bit of lime going\r\nout to sea, and forming part of a coral island, and then of a limestone\r\nrock, and then of a marble statue.  Very good.  Then look at this stone.\r\n\r\nWhat a curious stone!  Did it come from any place near here?\r\n\r\nNo.  It came from near Dudley, in Staffordshire, where the soils are\r\nworlds on worlds older than they are here, though they were made in the\r\nsame way as these and all other soils.  But you are not listening to me.\r\n\r\nWhy, the stone is full of shells, and bits of coral; and what are these\r\nwonderful things coiled and tangled together, like the snakes in Medusa's\r\nhair in the picture?  Are they snakes?\r\n\r\nIf they are, then they must be snakes who have all one head; for see,\r\nthey are joined together at their larger ends; and snakes which are\r\nbranched, too, which no snake ever was.\r\n\r\nYes.  I suppose they are not snakes.  And they grow out of a flower, too;\r\nand it has a stalk, jointed, too, as plants sometimes are; and as fishes'\r\nbackbones are too.  Is it a petrified plant or flower?\r\n\r\nNo; though I do not deny that it looks like one.  The creature most akin\r\nto it which you ever saw is a star-fish.\r\n\r\nWhat! one of the red star-fishes which one finds on the beach?  Its arms\r\nare not branched.\r\n\r\nNo.  But there are star-fishes with branched arms still in the sea.  You\r\nknow that pretty book (and learned book, too), Forbes's _British Star-\r\nfishes_?  You like to look it through for the sake of the vignettes,--the\r\nmermaid and her child playing in the sea.\r\n\r\nOh yes, and the kind bogie who is piping while the sandstars dance; and\r\nthe other who is trying to pull out the star-fish which the oyster has\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nYes.  But do you recollect the drawing of the Medusa's head, with its\r\ncurling arms, branched again and again without end?  Here it is.  No, you\r\nshall not look at the vignettes now.  We must mind business.  Now look at\r\nthis one; the Feather-star, with arms almost like fern-fronds.  And in\r\nforeign seas there are many other branched star-fish beside.\r\n\r\nBut they have no stalks?\r\n\r\nDo not be too sure of that.  This very feather-star, soon after it is\r\nborn, grows a tiny stalk, by which it holds on to corallines and\r\nsea-weeds; and it is not till afterwards that it breaks loose from that\r\nstalk, and swims away freely into the wide water.  And in foreign seas\r\nthere are several star-fish still who grow on stalks all their lives, as\r\nthis fossil one did.\r\n\r\nHow strange that a live animal should grow on a stalk, like a flower!\r\n\r\nNot quite like a flower.  A flower has roots, by which it feeds in the\r\nsoil.  These things grow more like sea-weeds, which have no roots, but\r\nonly hold on to the rock by the foot of the stalk, as a ship holds on by\r\nher anchor.  But as for its being strange that live animals should grow\r\non stalks, if it be strange it is common enough, like many far stranger\r\nthings.  For under the water are millions on millions of creatures,\r\nspreading for miles on miles, building up at last great reefs of rocks,\r\nand whole islands, which all grow rooted first to the rock, like\r\nsea-weeds; and what is more, they grow, most of them, from one common\r\nroot, branching again and again, and every branchlet bearing hundreds of\r\nliving creatures, so that the whole creation is at once one creature and\r\nmany creatures.  Do you not understand me?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThen fancy to yourself a bush like that hawthorn bush, with numberless\r\nblossoms, and every blossom on that bush a separate living thing, with\r\nits own mouth, and arms, and stomach, budding and growing fresh live\r\nbranches and fresh live flowers, as fast as the old ones die: and then\r\nyou will see better what I mean.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful!\r\n\r\nYes; but not more wonderful than your finger, for it, too, is made up of\r\nnumberless living things.\r\n\r\nMy finger made of living things?\r\n\r\nWhat else can it be?  When you cut your finger, does not the place heal?\r\n\r\nOf course.\r\n\r\nAnd what is healing but growing again?  And how could the atoms of your\r\nfingers grow, and make fresh skin, if they were not each of them alive?\r\nThere, I will not puzzle you with too much at once; you will know more\r\nabout all that some day.  Only remember now, that there is nothing\r\nwonderful in the world outside you but has its counterpart of something\r\njust as wonderful, and perhaps more wonderful, inside you.  Man is the\r\nmicrocosm, the little world, said the philosophers of old; and\r\nphilosophers nowadays are beginning to see that their old guess is actual\r\nfact and true.\r\n\r\nBut what are these curious sea-creatures called, which are animals, yet\r\ngrow like plants?\r\n\r\nThey have more names than I can tell you, or you remember.  Those which\r\nhelped to make this bit of stone are called coral-insects: but they are\r\nnot really insects, and are no more like insects than you are.\r\nCoral-polypes is the best name for them, because they have arms round\r\ntheir mouths, something like a cuttlefish, which the ancients called\r\nPolypus.  But the animal which you have seen likest to most of them is a\r\nsea-anemone.\r\n\r\nLook now at this piece of fresh coral--for coral it is, though not like\r\nthe coral which your sister wears in her necklace.  You see it is full of\r\npipes; in each of those pipes has lived what we will call, for the time\r\nbeing, a tiny sea-anemone, joined on to his brothers by some sort of\r\nflesh and skin; and all of them together have built up, out of the lime\r\nin the sea-water, this common house, or rather town, of lime.\r\n\r\nBut is it not strange and wonderful?\r\n\r\nOf course it is: but so is everything when you begin to look into it; and\r\nif I were to go on, and tell you what sort of young ones these\r\ncoral-polypes have, and what becomes of them, you would hear such\r\nwonders, that you would be ready to suspect that I was inventing\r\nnonsense, or talking in my dreams.  But all that belongs to Madam How's\r\ndeepest book of all, which is called the BOOK OF KIND: the book which\r\nchildren cannot understand, and in which only the very wisest men are\r\nable to spell out a few words, not knowing, and of course not daring to\r\nguess, what wonder may come next.\r\n\r\nNow we will go back to our stone, and talk about how it was made, and how\r\nthe stalked star-fish, which you mistook for a flower, ever got into the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThen do you think me silly for fancying that a fossil star-fish was a\r\nflower?\r\n\r\nI should be silly if I did.  There is no silliness in not knowing what\r\nyou cannot know.  You can only guess about new things, which you have\r\nnever seen before, by comparing them with old things, which you have seen\r\nbefore; and you had seen flowers, and snakes, and fishes' backbones, and\r\nmade a very fair guess from them.  After all, some of these stalked star-\r\nfish are so like flowers, lilies especially, that they are called\r\nEncrinites; and the whole family is called Crinoids, or lily-like\r\ncreatures, from the Greek work _krinon_, a lily; and as for corals and\r\ncorallines, learned men, in spite of all their care and shrewdness, made\r\nmistake after mistake about them, which they had to correct again and\r\nagain, till now, I trust, they have got at something very like the truth.\r\nNo, I shall only call you silly if you do what some little boys are apt\r\nto do--call other boys, and, still worse, servants or poor people, silly\r\nfor not knowing what they cannot know.\r\n\r\nBut are not poor people often very silly about animals and plants?  The\r\nboys at the village school say that slowworms are poisonous; is not that\r\nsilly?\r\n\r\nNot at all.  They know that adders bite, and so they think that slowworms\r\nbite too.  They are wrong; and they must be told that they are wrong, and\r\nscolded if they kill a slowworm.  But silly they are not.\r\n\r\nBut is it not silly to fancy that swallows sleep all the winter at the\r\nbottom of the pond?\r\n\r\nI do not think so.  The boys cannot know where the swallows go; and if\r\nyou told them--what is true--that the swallows find their way every\r\nautumn through France, through Spain, over the Straits of Gibraltar, into\r\nMorocco, and some, I believe, over the great desert of Zahara into\r\nNegroland: and if you told them--what is true also--that the young\r\nswallows actually find their way into Africa without having been along\r\nthe road before; because the old swallows go south a week or two first,\r\nand leave the young ones to guess out the way for themselves: if you told\r\nthem that, then they would have a right to say, \"Do you expect us to\r\nbelieve that?  That is much more wonderful than that the swallows should\r\nsleep in the pond.\"\r\n\r\nBut is it?\r\n\r\nYes; to them.  They know that bats and dormice and other things sleep all\r\nthe winter; so why should not swallows sleep?  They see the swallows\r\nabout the water, and often dipping almost into it.  They know that fishes\r\nlive under water, and that many insects--like May-flies and caddis-flies\r\nand water-beetles--live sometimes in the water, sometimes in the open\r\nair; and they cannot know--you do not know--what it is which prevents a\r\nbird's living under water.  So their guess is really a very fair one; no\r\nmore silly than that of the savages, who when they first saw the white\r\nmen's ships, with their huge sails, fancied they were enormous sea-birds;\r\nand when they heard the cannons fire, said that the ships spoke in\r\nthunder and lightning.  Their guess was wrong, but not silly; for it was\r\nthe best guess they could make.\r\n\r\nBut I do know of one old woman who was silly.  She was a boy's nurse, and\r\nshe gave the boy a thing which she said was one of the snakes which St.\r\nHilda turned into stone; and told him that they found plenty of them at\r\nWhitby, where she was born, all coiled up; but what was very odd, their\r\nheads had always been broken of.  And when he took it, to his father, he\r\ntold him it was only a fossil shell--an Ammonite.  And he went back and\r\nlaughed at his nurse, and teased her till she was quite angry.\r\n\r\nThen he was very lucky that she did not box his ears, for that was what\r\nhe deserved.  I dare say that, though his nurse had never heard of\r\nAmmonites, she was a wise old dame enough, and knew a hundred things\r\nwhich he did not know, and which were far more important than Ammonites,\r\neven to him.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBecause if she had not known how to nurse him well, he would perhaps have\r\nnever grown up alive and strong.  And if she had not known how to make\r\nhim obey and speak the truth, he might have grown up a naughty boy.\r\n\r\nBut was she not silly?\r\n\r\nNo.  She only believed what the Whitby folk, I understand, have some of\r\nthem believed for many hundred years.  And no one can be blamed for\r\nthinking as his forefathers did, unless he has cause to know better.\r\n\r\nSurely she might have known better?\r\n\r\nHow?  What reason could she have to believe the Ammonite was a shell?  It\r\nis not the least like cockles, or whelks, or any shell she ever saw.\r\n\r\nWhat reason either could she have to guess that Whitby cliff had once\r\nbeen coral-mud, at the bottom of the sea?  No more reason, my dear child,\r\nthan you would have to guess that this stone had been coral-mud likewise,\r\nif I did not teach you so,--or rather, try to make you teach yourself so.\r\n\r\nNo.  I say it again.  If you wish to learn, I will only teach you on\r\ncondition that you do not laugh at, or despise, those good and honest and\r\nable people who do not know or care about these things, because they have\r\nother things to think of: like old John out there ploughing.  He would\r\nnot believe you--he would hardly believe me--if we told him that this\r\nstone had been once a swarm of living things, of exquisite shapes and\r\nglorious colours.  And yet he can plough and sow, and reap and mow, and\r\nfell and strip, and hedge and ditch, and give his neighbours sound\r\nadvice, and take the measure of a man's worth from ten minutes' talk, and\r\nsay his prayers, and keep his temper, and pay his debts,--which last\r\nthree things are more than a good many folks can do who fancy themselves\r\na whole world wiser than John in the smock-frock.\r\n\r\nOh, but I want to hear about the exquisite shapes and glorious colours.\r\n\r\nOf course you do, little man.  A few fine epithets take your fancy far\r\nmore than a little common sense and common humility; but in that you are\r\nno worse than some of your elders.  So now for the exquisite shapes and\r\nglorious colours.  I have never seen them; though I trust to see them ere\r\nI die.  So what they are like I can only tell from what I have learnt\r\nfrom Mr. Darwin, and Mr. Wallace, and Mr. Jukes, and Mr. Gosse, and last,\r\nbut not least, from one whose soul was as beautiful as his face, Lucas\r\nBarrett,--too soon lost to science,--who was drowned in exploring such a\r\ncoral-reef as this stone was once.\r\n\r\nThen there are such things alive now?\r\n\r\nYes, and no.  The descendants of most of them live on, altered by time,\r\nwhich alters all things; and from the beauty of the children we can guess\r\nat the beauty of their ancestors; just as from the coral-reefs which\r\nexist now we can guess how the coral-reefs of old were made.  And that\r\nthis stone was once part of a coral-reef the corals in it prove at first\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nAnd what is a coral-reef like?\r\n\r\nYou have seen the room in the British Museum full of corals, madrepores,\r\nbrain-stones, corallines, and sea-ferns?\r\n\r\nOh yes.\r\n\r\nThen fancy all those alive.  Not as they are now, white stone: but\r\ncovered in jelly; and out of every pore a little polype, like a flower,\r\npeeping out.  Fancy them of every gaudy colour you choose.  No bed of\r\nflowers, they say, can be more brilliant than the corals, as you look\r\ndown on them through the clear sea.  Fancy, again, growing among them and\r\ncrawling over them, strange sea-anemones, shells, star-fish, sea-slugs,\r\nand sea-cucumbers with feathery gills, crabs, and shrimps, and hundreds\r\nof other animals, all as strange in shape, and as brilliant in colour.\r\nYou may let your fancy run wild.  Nothing so odd, nothing so gay, even\r\nentered your dreams, or a poet's, as you may find alive at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, in the live flower-gardens of the sea-fairies.\r\n\r\nThere will be shoals of fish, too, playing in and out, as strange and\r\ngaudy as the rest,--parrot-fish who browse on the live coral with their\r\nbeak-like teeth, as cattle browse on grass; and at the bottom, it may be,\r\nlarger and uglier fish, who eat the crabs and shell-fish, shells and all,\r\ngrinding them up as a dog grinds a bone, and so turning shells and corals\r\ninto fine soft mud, such as this stone is partly made of.\r\n\r\nBut what happens to all the delicate little corals if a storm comes on?\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed?  Madam How has made them so well and wisely, that, like\r\nbrave and good men, the more trouble they suffer the stronger they are.\r\nDay and night, week after week, the trade-wind blows upon them, hurling\r\nthe waves against them in furious surf, knocking off great lumps of\r\ncoral, grinding them to powder, throwing them over the reef into the\r\nshallow water inside.  But the heavier the surf beats upon them, the\r\nstronger the polypes outside grow, repairing their broken houses, and\r\nbuilding up fresh coral on the dead coral below, because it is in the\r\nfresh sea-water that beats upon the surf that they find most lime with\r\nwhich to build.  And as they build they form a barrier against the surf,\r\ninside of which, in water still as glass, the weaker and more delicate\r\nthings can grow in safety, just as these very Encrinites may have grown,\r\nrooted in the lime-mud, and waving their slender arms at the bottom of\r\nthe clear lagoon.  Such mighty builders are these little coral polypes,\r\nthat all the works of men are small compared with theirs.  One single\r\nreef, for instance, which is entirely made by them, stretches along the\r\nnorth-east coast of Australia for nearly a thousand miles.  Of this you\r\nmust read some day in Mr. Jukes's _Voyage of H.M.S. \"Fly_.\"  Every island\r\nthroughout a great part of the Pacific is fringed round each with its\r\ncoral-reef, and there are hundreds of islands of strange shapes, and of\r\nAtolls, as they are called, or ring-islands, which are composed entirely\r\nof coral, and of nothing else.\r\n\r\nA ring-island?  How can an island be made in the shape of a ring?\r\n\r\nAh! it was a long time before men found out that riddle.  Mr. Darwin was\r\nthe first to guess the answer, as he has guessed many an answer beside.\r\nThese islands are each a ring, or nearly a ring of coral, with smooth\r\nshallow water inside: but their outsides run down, like a mountain wall,\r\nsheer into seas hundreds of fathoms deep.  People used to believe, and\r\nreasonably enough, that the coral polypes began to build up the islands\r\nfrom the very bottom of the deep sea.\r\n\r\nBut that would not account for the top of them being of the shape of a\r\nring; and in time it was found out that the corals would not build except\r\nin shallow water, twenty or thirty fathoms deep at most, and men were at\r\ntheir wits' ends to find out the riddle.  Then said Mr. Darwin, \"Suppose\r\none of those beautiful South Sea Islands, like Tahiti, the Queen of\r\nIsles, with its ring of coral-reef all round its shore, began sinking\r\nslowly under the sea.  The land, as it sunk, would be gone for good and\r\nall: but the coral-reef round it would not, because the coral polypes\r\nwould build up and up continually upon the skeletons of their dead\r\nparents, to get to the surface of the water, and would keep close to the\r\ntop outside, however much the land sunk inside; and when the island had\r\nsunk completely beneath the sea, what would be left?  What must be left\r\nbut a ring of coral reef, around the spot where the last mountain peak of\r\nthe island sank beneath the sea?\"  And so Mr. Darwin explained the shapes\r\nof hundreds of coral islands in the Pacific; and proved, too, some\r\nstrange things besides (he proved, and other men, like Mr. Wallace, whose\r\nexcellent book on the East Indian islands you must read some day, have\r\nproved in other ways) that there was once a great continent, joined\r\nperhaps to Australia and to New Guinea, in the Pacific Ocean, where is\r\nnow nothing but deep sea, and coral-reefs which mark the mountain ranges\r\nof that sunken world.\r\n\r\nBut how does the coral ever rise above the surface of the water and turn\r\ninto hard stone?\r\n\r\nOf course the coral polypes cannot build above the high-tide mark; but\r\nthe surf which beats upon them piles up their broken fragments just as a\r\nsea-beach is piled up, and hammers them together with that water hammer\r\nwhich is heavier and stronger than any you have ever seen in a smith's\r\nforge.  And then, as is the fashion of lime, the whole mass sets and\r\nbecomes hard, as you may see mortar set; and so you have a low island a\r\nfew feet above the sea.  Then sea-birds come to it, and rest and build;\r\nand seeds are floated thither from far lands; and among them almost\r\nalways the cocoa-nut, which loves to grow by the sea-shore, and groves of\r\ncocoa palms grow up upon the lonely isle.  Then, perhaps, trees and\r\nbushes are drifted thither before the trade-wind; and entangled in their\r\nroots are seeds of other plants, and eggs or cocoons of insects; and so a\r\nfew flowers and a few butterflies and beetles set up for themselves upon\r\nthe new land.  And then a bird or two, caught in a storm and blown away\r\nto sea finds shelter in the cocoa-grove; and so a little new world is set\r\nup, in which (you must remember always) there are no four-footed beasts,\r\nnor snakes, nor lizards, nor frogs, nor any animals that cannot cross the\r\nsea.  And on some of those islands they may live (indeed there is reason\r\nto believe they have lived), so long, that some of them have changed\r\ntheir forms, according to the laws of Madam How, who sooner or later fits\r\neach thing exactly for the place in which it is meant to live, till upon\r\nsome of them you may find such strange and unique creatures as the famous\r\ncocoa-nut crab, which learned men call _Birgus latro_.  A great crab he\r\nis, who walks upon the tips of his toes a foot high above the ground.  And\r\nbecause he has often nothing to eat but cocoa-nuts, or at least they are\r\nthe best things he can find, cocoa-nuts he has learned to eat, and after\r\na fashion which it would puzzle you to imitate.  Some say that he climbs\r\nup the stems of the cocoa-nut trees, and pulls the fruit down for\r\nhimself; but that, it seems, he does not usually do.  What he does is\r\nthis: when he finds a fallen cocoa-nut, he begins tearing away the thick\r\nhusk and fibre with his strong claws; and he knows perfectly well which\r\nend to tear it from, namely, from the end where the three eye-holes are,\r\nwhich you call the monkey's face, out of one of which you know, the young\r\ncocoa-nut tree would burst forth.  And when he has got to the eye-holes,\r\nhe hammers through one of them with the point of his heavy claw.  So far,\r\nso good: but how is he to get the meat out?  He cannot put his claw in.\r\nHe has no proboscis like a butterfly to insert and suck with.  He is as\r\nfar off from his dinner as the fox was when the stork offered him a feast\r\nin a long-necked jar.  What then do you think he does?  He turns himself\r\nround, puts in a pair of his hind pincers, which are very slender, and\r\nwith them scoops the meat out of the cocoa-nut, and so puts his dinner\r\ninto his mouth with his hind feet.  And even the cocoa-nut husk he does\r\nnot waste; for he lives in deep burrows which he makes like a rabbit; and\r\nbeing a luxurious crab, and liking to sleep soft in spite of his hard\r\nshell, he lines them with a quantity of cocoa-nut fibre, picked out clean\r\nand fine, just as if he was going to make cocoa-nut matting of it.  And\r\nbeing also a clean crab, as I hope you are a clean little boy, he goes\r\ndown to the sea every night to have his bath and moisten his gills, and\r\nso lives happy all his days, and gets so fat in his old age that he\r\ncarries about his body nearly a quart of pure oil.\r\n\r\nThat is the history of the cocoa-nut crab.  And if any one tells me that\r\nthat crab acts only on what is called \"instinct\"; and does not think and\r\nreason, just as you and I think and reason, though of course not in words\r\nas you and I do: then I shall be inclined to say that that person does\r\nnot think nor reason either.\r\n\r\nThen were there many coral-reefs in Britain in old times?\r\n\r\nYes, many and many, again and again; some whole ages older than this, a\r\nbit of which you see, and some again whole ages newer.  But look: then\r\njudge for yourself.  Look at this geological map.  Wherever you see a bit\r\nof blue, which is the mark for limestone, you may say, \"There is a bit of\r\nold coral-reef rising up to the surface.\"  But because I will not puzzle\r\nyour little head with too many things at once, you shall look at one set\r\nof coral-reefs which are far newer than this bit of Dudley limestone, and\r\nwhich are the largest, I suppose, that ever were in this country; or, at\r\nleast, there is more of them left than of any others.\r\n\r\nLook first at Ireland.  You see that almost all the middle of Ireland is\r\ncoloured blue.  It is one great sheet of old coral-reef and coral-mud,\r\nwhich is now called the carboniferous limestone.  You see red and purple\r\npatches rising out of it, like islands--and islands I suppose they were,\r\nof hard and ancient rock, standing up in the middle of the coral sea.\r\n\r\nBut look again, and you will see that along the west coast of Ireland,\r\nexcept in a very few places, like Galway Bay, the blue limestone does not\r\ncome down to the sea; the shore is coloured purple and brown, and those\r\ncolours mark the ancient rocks and high mountains of Mayo and Galway and\r\nKerry, which stand as barriers to keep the raging surf of the Atlantic\r\nfrom bursting inland and beating away, as it surely would in course of\r\ntime, the low flat limestone plain of the middle of Ireland.  But the\r\nsame coral-reefs once stretched out far to the westward into the Atlantic\r\nOcean; and you may see the proof upon that map.  For in the western bays,\r\nin Clew Bay with its hundred islands, and Galway Bay with its Isles of\r\nArran, and beautiful Kenmare, and beautiful Bantry, you see little blue\r\nspots, which are low limestone islands, standing in the sea, overhung by\r\nmountains far aloft.  You have often heard those islands in Kenmare Bay\r\ntalked of, and how some whom you know go to fish round them by night for\r\nturbot and conger; and when you hear them spoken of again, you must\r\nrecollect that they are the last fragments of a great fringing\r\ncoral-reef, which will in a few thousand years follow the fate of the\r\nrest, and be eaten up by the waves, while the mountains of hard rock\r\nstand round them still unchanged.\r\n\r\nNow look at England, and there you will see patches at least of a great\r\ncoral-reef which was forming at the same time as that Irish one, and on\r\nwhich perhaps some of your schoolfellows have often stood.  You have\r\nheard of St. Vincent's Rocks at Bristol, and the marble cliffs, 250 feet\r\nin height, covered in part with rich wood and rare flowers, and the Avon\r\nrunning through the narrow gorge, and the stately ships sailing far below\r\nyour feet from Bristol to the Severn sea.  And you may see, for here they\r\nare, corals from St. Vincent's Rocks, cut and polished, showing too that\r\nthey also, like the Dudley limestone, are made up of corals and of coral-\r\nmud.  Now, whenever you see St. Vincent's Rocks, as I suspect you very\r\nsoon will, recollect where you are, and use your fancy, to paint for\r\nyourself a picture as strange as it is true.  Fancy that those rocks are\r\nwhat they once were, a coral-reef close to the surface of a shallow sea.\r\nFancy that there is no gorge of the Avon, no wide Severn sea--for those\r\nwere eaten out by water ages and ages afterwards.  But picture to\r\nyourself the coral sea reaching away to the north, to the foot of the\r\nWelsh mountains; and then fancy yourself, if you will, in a canoe,\r\npaddling up through the coral-reefs, north and still north, up the valley\r\ndown which the Severn now flows, up through what is now Worcestershire,\r\nthen up through Staffordshire, then through Derbyshire, into Yorkshire,\r\nand so on through Durham and Northumberland, till your find yourself\r\nstopped by the Ettrick hills in Scotland; while all to the westward of\r\nyou, where is now the greater part of England, was open sea.  You may\r\nsay, if you know anything of the geography of England, \"Impossible!  That\r\nwould be to paddle over the tops of high mountains; over the top of the\r\nPeak in Derbyshire, over the top of High Craven and Whernside and Pen-y-\r\ngent and Cross Fell, and to paddle too over the Cheviot Hills, which part\r\nEngland and Scotland.\"  I know it, my child, I know it.  But so it was\r\nonce on a time.  The high limestone mountains which part Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire--the very chine and backbone of England--were once coral-reefs\r\nat the bottom of the sea.  They are all made up of the carboniferous\r\nlimestone, so called, as your little knowledge of Latin ought to tell\r\nyou, because it carries the coal; because the coalfields usually lie upon\r\nit.  It may be impossible in your eyes: but remember always that nothing\r\nis impossible with God.\r\n\r\nBut you said that the coal was made from plants and trees, and did plants\r\nand trees grow on this coral-reef?\r\n\r\nThat I cannot say.  Trees may have grown on the dry parts of the reef, as\r\ncocoa-nuts grow now in the Pacific.  But the coal was not laid down upon\r\nit till long afterwards, when it had gone through many and strange\r\nchanges.  For all through the chine of England, and in a part of Ireland\r\ntoo, there lies upon the top of the limestone a hard gritty rock, in some\r\nplaces three thousand feet thick, which is commonly called \"the\r\nmill-stone grit.\"  And above that again the coal begins.  Now to make\r\nthat 3000 feet of hard rock, what must have happened?  The sea-bottom\r\nmust have sunk, slowly no doubt, carrying the coral-reefs down with it,\r\n3000 feet at least.  And meanwhile sand and mud, made from the wearing\r\naway of the old lands in the North must have settled down upon it.  I say\r\nfrom the North--for there are no fossils, as far as I know, or sign of\r\nlife, in these rocks of mill-stone grit; and therefore it is reasonable\r\nto suppose that they were brought from a cold current at the Pole, too\r\ncold to allow sea-beasts to live,--quite cold enough, certainly, to kill\r\ncoral insects, who could only thrive in warm water coming from the South.\r\n\r\nThen, to go on with my story, upon the top of these mill-stone grits came\r\nsand and mud, and peat, and trees, and plants, washed out to sea, as far\r\nas we can guess, from the mouths of vast rivers flowing from the West,\r\nrivers as vast as the Amazon, the Mississippi, or the Orinoco are now;\r\nand so in long ages, upon the top of the limestone and upon the top of\r\nthe mill-stone grit, were laid down those beds of coal which you see\r\nburnt now in every fire.\r\n\r\nBut how did the coral-reefs rise till they became cliffs at Bristol and\r\nmountains in Yorkshire?\r\n\r\nThe earthquake steam, I suppose, raised them.  One earthquake indeed, or\r\nseries of earthquakes, there was, running along between Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire, which made that vast crack and upheaval in the rocks, the\r\nCraven Fault, running, I believe, for more than a hundred miles, and\r\nlifting the rocks in some places several hundred feet.  That earthquake\r\nhelped to make the high hills which overhang Manchester and Preston, and\r\nall the manufacturing county of Lancashire.  That earthquake helped to\r\nmake the perpendicular cliff at Malham Cove, and many another beautiful\r\nbit of scenery.  And that and other earthquakes, by heating the rocks\r\nfrom the fires below, may have helped to change them from soft coral into\r\nhard crystalline marble as you see them now, just as volcanic heat has\r\nhardened and purified the beautiful white marbles of Pentelicus and Paros\r\nin Greece, and Carrara in Italy, from which statues are carved unto this\r\nday.  Or the same earthquake may have heated and hardened the limestones\r\nsimply by grinding and squeezing them; or they may have been heated and\r\nhardened in the course of long ages simply by the weight of the thousands\r\nof feet of other rock which lay upon them.  For pressure, you must\r\nremember, produces heat.  When you strike flint and steel together, the\r\npressure of the blow not only makes bits of steel fly off, but makes them\r\nfly off in red-hot sparks.  When you hammer a piece of iron with a\r\nhammer, you will soon find it get quite warm.  When you squeeze the air\r\ntogether in your pop-gun, you actually make the air inside warmer, till\r\nthe pellet flies out, and the air expands and cools again.  Nay, I\r\nbelieve you cannot hold up a stone on the palm of your hand without that\r\nstone after a while warming your hand, because it presses against you in\r\ntrying to fall, and you press against it in trying to hold it up.  And\r\nrecollect above all the great and beautiful example of that law which you\r\nwere lucky enough to see on the night of the 14th of November 1867, how\r\nthose falling stars, as I told you then, were coming out of boundless\r\nspace, colder than any ice on earth, and yet, simply by pressing against\r\nthe air above our heads, they had their motion turned into heat, till\r\nthey burned themselves up into trains of fiery dust.  So remember that\r\nwherever you have pressure you have heat, and that the pressure of the\r\nupper rocks upon the lower is quite enough, some think, to account for\r\nthe older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer ones.\r\n\r\nBut why should the lower rocks be older and the upper rocks newer?  You\r\ntold me just now that the high mountains in Wales were ages older than\r\nWindsor Forest, upon which we stand: but yet how much lower we are here\r\nthan if we were on a Welsh mountain.\r\n\r\nAh, my dear child, of course that puzzles you, and I am afraid it must\r\npuzzle you still till we have another talk; or rather it seems to me that\r\nthe best way to explain that puzzle to you would be for you and me to go\r\na journey into the far west, and look into the matter for ourselves; and\r\nfrom here to the far west we will go, either in fancy or on a real\r\nrailroad and steamboat, before we have another talk about these things.\r\n\r\nNow it is time to stop.  Is there anything more you want to know? for you\r\nlook as if something was puzzling you still.\r\n\r\nWere there any men in the world while all this was going on?\r\n\r\nI think not.  We have no proof that there were not: but also we have no\r\nproof that there were; the cave-men, of whom I told you, lived many ages\r\nafter the coal was covered up.  You seem to be sorry that there were no\r\nmen in the world then.\r\n\r\nBecause it seems a pity that there was no one to see those beautiful\r\ncoral-reefs and coal-forests.\r\n\r\nNo one to see them, my child?  Who told you that?  Who told you there are\r\nnot, and never have been any rational beings in this vast universe, save\r\ncertain weak, ignorant, short-sighted creatures shaped like you and me?\r\nBut even if it were so, and no created eye had ever beheld those ancient\r\nwonders, and no created heart ever enjoyed them, is there not one\r\nUncreated who has seen them and enjoyed them from the beginning?  Were\r\nnot these creatures enjoying themselves each after their kind?  And was\r\nthere not a Father in Heaven who was enjoying their enjoyment, and\r\nenjoying too their beauty, which He had formed according to the ideas of\r\nHis Eternal Mind?  Recollect what you were told on Trinity Sunday--That\r\nthis world was not made for man alone: but that man, and this world, and\r\nthe whole Universe was made for God; for He created all things, and for\r\nHis pleasure they are, and were created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--FIELD AND WILD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere were we to go next?  Into the far west, to see how all the way\r\nalong the railroads the new rocks and soils lie above the older, and yet\r\nhow, when we get westward, the oldest rocks rise highest into the air.\r\n\r\nWell, we will go: but not, I think, to-day.  Indeed I hardly know how we\r\ncould get as far as Reading; for all the world is in the hay-field, and\r\neven the old horse must go thither too, and take his turn at the\r\nhay-cart.  Well, the rocks have been where they are for many a year, and\r\nthey will wait our leisure patiently enough: but Midsummer and the hay-\r\nfield will not wait.  Let us take what God gives when He sends it, and\r\nlearn the lesson that lies nearest to us.  After all, it is more to my\r\nold mind, and perhaps to your young mind too, to look at things which are\r\nyoung and fresh and living, rather than things which are old and worn and\r\ndead.  Let us leave the old stones, and the old bones, and the old\r\nshells, the wrecks of ancient worlds which have gone down into the\r\nkingdom of death, to teach us their grand lessons some other day; and let\r\nus look now at the world of light and life and beauty, which begins here\r\nat the open door, and stretches away over the hay-fields, over the woods,\r\nover the southern moors, over sunny France, and sunnier Spain, and over\r\nthe tropic seas, down to the equator, and the palm-groves of the eternal\r\nsummer.  If we cannot find something, even at starting from the open\r\ndoor, to teach us about Why and How, we must be very short-sighted, or\r\nvery shallow-hearted.\r\n\r\nThere is the old cock starling screeching in the eaves, because he wants\r\nto frighten us away, and take a worm to his children, without our finding\r\nout whereabouts his hole is.  How does he know that we might hurt him?\r\nand how again does he not know that we shall not hurt him? we, who for\r\nfive-and-twenty years have let him and his ancestors build under those\r\neaves in peace?  How did he get that quantity of half-wit, that sort of\r\nstupid cunning, into his little brain, and yet get no more?  And why (for\r\nthis is a question of Why, and not of How) does he labour all day long,\r\nhunting for worms and insects for his children, while his wife nurses\r\nthem in the nest?  Why, too, did he help her to build that nest with toil\r\nand care this spring, for the sake of a set of nestlings who can be of no\r\ngain or use to him, but only take the food out of his mouth?  Simply out\r\nof--what shall I call it, my child?--Love; that same sense of love and\r\nduty, coming surely from that one Fountain of all duty and all love,\r\nwhich makes your father work for you.  That the mother should take care\r\nof her young, is wonderful enough; but that (at least among many birds)\r\nthe father should help likewise, is (as you will find out as you grow\r\nolder) more wonderful far.  So there already the old starling has set us\r\ntwo fresh puzzles about How and Why, neither of which we shall get\r\nanswered, at least on this side of the grave.\r\n\r\nCome on, up the field, under the great generous sun, who quarrels with no\r\none, grudges no one, but shines alike upon the evil and the good.  What a\r\ngay picture he is painting now, with his light-pencils; for in them,\r\nremember, and not in the things themselves the colour lies.  See how,\r\nwhere the hay has been already carried, he floods all the slopes with\r\nyellow light, making them stand out sharp against the black shadows of\r\nthe wood; while where the grass is standing still, he makes the sheets of\r\nsorrel-flower blush rosy red, or dapples the field with white oxeyes.\r\n\r\nBut is not the sorrel itself red, and the oxeyes white?\r\n\r\nWhat colour are they at night, when the sun is gone?\r\n\r\nDark.\r\n\r\nThat is, no colour.  The very grass is not green at night.\r\n\r\nOh, but it is if you look at it with a lantern.\r\n\r\nNo, no.  It is the light of the lantern, which happens to be strong\r\nenough to make the leaves look green, though it is not strong enough to\r\nmake a geranium look red.\r\n\r\nNot red?\r\n\r\nNo; the geranium flowers by a lantern look black, while the leaves look\r\ngreen.  If you don't believe me, we will try.\r\n\r\nBut why is that?\r\n\r\nWhy, I cannot tell: and how, you had best ask Professor Tyndall, if you\r\never have the honour of meeting him.\r\n\r\nBut now--hark to the mowing-machine, humming like a giant night-jar.  Come\r\nup and look at it, and see how swift and smooth it shears the long grass\r\ndown, so that in the middle of the swathe it seems to have merely fallen\r\nflat, and you must move it before you find that it has been cut off.\r\n\r\nAh, there is a proof to us of what men may do if they will only learn the\r\nlessons which Madam How can teach them.  There is that boy, fresh from\r\nthe National School, cutting more grass in a day than six strong mowers\r\ncould have cut, and cutting it better, too; for the mowing-machine goes\r\nso much nearer to the ground than the scythe, that we gain by it two\r\nhundredweight of hay on every acre.  And see, too, how persevering old\r\nMadam How will not stop her work, though the machine has cut off all the\r\ngrass which she has been making for the last three months; for as fast as\r\nwe shear it off, she makes it grow again.  There are fresh blades, here\r\nat our feet, a full inch long, which have sprung up in the last two days,\r\nfor the cattle when they are turned in next week.\r\n\r\nBut if the machine cuts all the grass, the poor mowers will have nothing\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nNot so.  They are all busy enough elsewhere.  There is plenty of other\r\nwork to be done, thank God; and wholesomer and easier work than mowing\r\nwith a burning sun on their backs, drinking gallons of beer, and getting\r\nfirst hot and then cold across the loins, till they lay in a store of\r\nlumbago and sciatica, to cripple them in their old age.  You delight in\r\nmachinery because it is curious: you should delight in it besides because\r\nit does good, and nothing but good, where it is used, according to the\r\nlaws of Lady Why, with care, moderation, and mercy, and fair-play between\r\nman and man.  For example: just as the mowing-machine saves the mowers,\r\nthe threshing-machine saves the threshers from rheumatism and chest\r\ncomplaints,--which they used to catch in the draught and dust of the\r\nunhealthiest place in the whole parish, which is, the old-fashioned\r\nbarn's floor.  And so, we may hope, in future years all heavy drudgery\r\nand dirty work will be done more and more by machines, and people will\r\nhave more and more chance of keeping themselves clean and healthy, and\r\nmore and more time to read, and learn, and think, and be true civilised\r\nmen and women, instead of being mere live ploughs, or live manure-carts,\r\nsuch as I have seen ere now.\r\n\r\nA live manure-cart?\r\n\r\nYes, child.  If you had seen, as I have seen, in foreign lands, poor\r\nwomen, haggard, dirty, grown old before their youth was over, toiling up\r\nhill with baskets of foul manure upon their backs, you would have said,\r\nas I have said, \"Oh for Madam How to cure that ignorance!  Oh for Lady\r\nWhy to cure that barbarism!  Oh that Madam How would teach them that\r\nmachinery must always be cheaper in the long run than human muscles and\r\nnerves!  Oh that Lady Why would teach them that a woman is the most\r\nprecious thing on earth, and that if she be turned into a beast of\r\nburden, Lady Why--and Madam How likewise--will surely avenge the wrongs\r\nof their human sister!\"  There, you do not quite know what I mean, and I\r\ndo not care that you should.  It is good for little folk that big folk\r\nshould now and then \"talk over their heads,\" as the saying is, and make\r\nthem feel how ignorant they are, and how many solemn and earnest\r\nquestions there are in the world on which they must make up their minds\r\nsome day, though not yet.  But now we will talk about the hay: or rather\r\ndo you and the rest go and play in the hay and gather it up, build forts\r\nof it, storm them, pull them down, build them up again, shout, laugh, and\r\nscream till you are hot and tired.  You will please Madam How thereby,\r\nand Lady Why likewise.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBecause Madam How naturally wants her work to succeed, and she is at work\r\nnow making you.\r\n\r\nMaking me?\r\n\r\nOf course.  Making a man of you, out of a boy.  And that can only be done\r\nby the life-blood which runs through and through you.  And the more you\r\nlaugh and shout, the more pure air will pass into your blood, and make it\r\nred and healthy; and the more you romp and play--unless you overtire\r\nyourself--the quicker will that blood flow through all your limbs, to\r\nmake bone and muscle, and help you to grow into a man.\r\n\r\nBut why does Lady Why like to see us play?\r\n\r\nShe likes to see you happy, as she likes to see the trees and birds\r\nhappy.  For she knows well that there is no food, nor medicine either,\r\nlike happiness.  If people are not happy enough, they are often tempted\r\nto do many wrong deeds, and to think many wrong thoughts: and if by God's\r\ngrace they know the laws of Lady Why, and keep from sin, still\r\nunhappiness, if it goes on too long, wears them out, body and mind; and\r\nthey grow ill and die, of broken hearts, and broken brains, my child; and\r\nso at last, poor souls, find \"Rest beneath the Cross.\"\r\n\r\nChildren, too, who are unhappy; children who are bullied, and frightened,\r\nand kept dull and silent, never thrive.  Their bodies do not thrive; for\r\nthey grow up weak.  Their minds do not thrive; for they grow up dull.\r\nTheir souls do not thrive; for they learn mean, sly, slavish ways, which\r\nGod forbid you should ever learn.  Well said the wise man, \"The human\r\nplant, like the vegetables, can only flower in sunshine.\"\r\n\r\nSo do you go, and enjoy yourself in the sunshine; but remember this--You\r\nknow what happiness is.  Then if you wish to please Lady Why, and Lady\r\nWhy's Lord and King likewise, you will never pass a little child without\r\ntrying to make it happier, even by a passing smile.  And now be off, and\r\nplay in the hay, and come back to me when you are tired.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLet us lie down at the foot of this old oak, and see what we can see.\r\n\r\nAnd hear what we can hear, too.  What is that humming all round us, now\r\nthat the noisy mowing-machine has stopped?\r\n\r\nAnd as much softer than the noise of mowing-machine hum, as the machines\r\nwhich make it are more delicate and more curious.  Madam How is a very\r\nskilful workwoman, and has eyes which see deeper and clearer than all\r\nmicroscopes; as you would find, if you tried to see what makes that\r\n\"Midsummer hum\" of which the haymakers are so fond, because it promises\r\nfair weather.\r\n\r\nWhy, it is only the gnats and flies.\r\n\r\nOnly the gnats and flies?  You might study those gnats and flies for your\r\nwhole life without finding out all--or more than a very little--about\r\nthem.  I wish I knew how they move those tiny wings of theirs--a thousand\r\ntimes in a second, I dare say, some of them.  I wish I knew how far they\r\nknow that they are happy--for happy they must be, whether they know it or\r\nnot.  I wish I knew how they live at all.  I wish I even knew how many\r\nsorts there are humming round us at this moment.\r\n\r\nHow many kinds?  Three or four?\r\n\r\nMore probably thirty or forty round this single tree.\r\n\r\nBut why should there be so many kinds of living things?  Would not one or\r\ntwo have done just as well?\r\n\r\nWhy, indeed?  Why should there not have been only one sort of butterfly,\r\nand he only of one colour, a plain brown, or a plain white?\r\n\r\nAnd why should there be so many sorts of birds, all robbing the garden at\r\nonce?  Thrushes, and blackbirds, and sparrows, and chaffinches, and\r\ngreenfinches, and bullfinches, and tomtits.\r\n\r\nAnd there are four kinds of tomtits round here, remember: but we may go\r\non with such talk for ever.  Wiser men than we have asked the same\r\nquestion: but Lady Why will not answer them yet.  However, there is\r\nanother question, which Madam How seems inclined to answer just now,\r\nwhich is almost as deep and mysterious.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\n_How_ all these different kinds of things became different.\r\n\r\nOh, do tell me!\r\n\r\nNot I.  You must begin at the beginning, before you can end at the end,\r\nor even make one step towards the end.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nYou must learn the differences between things, before you can find out\r\nhow those differences came about.  You must learn Madam How's alphabet\r\nbefore you can read her book.  And Madam How's alphabet of animals and\r\nplants is, Species, Kinds of things.  You must see which are like, and\r\nwhich unlike; what they are like in, and what they are unlike in.  You\r\nare beginning to do that with your collection of butterflies.  You like\r\nto arrange them, and those that are most like nearest to each other, and\r\nto compare them.  You must do that with thousands of different kinds of\r\nthings before you can read one page of Madam How's Natural History Book\r\nrightly.\r\n\r\nBut it will take so much time and so much trouble.\r\n\r\nGod grant that you may not spend more time on worse matters, and take\r\nmore trouble over things which will profit you far less.  But so it must\r\nbe, willy-nilly.  You must learn the alphabet if you mean to read.  And\r\nyou must learn the value of the figures before you can do a sum.  Why,\r\nwhat would you think of any one who sat down to play at cards--for money\r\ntoo (which I hope and trust you never will do)--before he knew the names\r\nof the cards, and which counted highest, and took the other?\r\n\r\nOf course he would be very foolish.\r\n\r\nJust as foolish are those who make up \"theories\" (as they call them)\r\nabout this world, and how it was made, before they have found out what\r\nthe world is made of.  You might as well try to find out how this hay-\r\nfield was made, without finding out first what the hay is made of.\r\n\r\nHow the hay-field was made?  Was it not always a hay-field?\r\n\r\nAh, yes; the old story, my child: Was not the earth always just what it\r\nis now?  Let us see for ourselves whether this was always a hay-field.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nJust pick out all the different kinds of plants and flowers you can find\r\nround us here.  How many do you think there are?\r\n\r\nOh--there seem to be four or five.\r\n\r\nJust as there were three or four kinds of flies in the air.  Pick them,\r\nchild, and count.  Let us have facts.\r\n\r\nHow many?  What! a dozen already?\r\n\r\nYes--and here is another, and another.  Why, I have got I don't know how\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nWhy not?  Bring them here, and let us see.  Nine kinds of grasses, and a\r\nrush.  Six kinds of clovers and vetches; and besides, dandelion, and\r\nrattle, and oxeye, and sorrel, and plantain, and buttercup, and a little\r\nstitchwort, and pignut, and mouse-ear hawkweed, too, which nobody wants.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause they are a sign that I am not a good farmer enough, and have not\r\nquite turned my Wild into Field.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nLook outside the boundary fence, at the moors and woods; they are forest,\r\nWild--\"Wald,\" as the Germans would call it.  Inside the fence is\r\nField--\"Feld,\" as the Germans would call it.  Guess why?\r\n\r\nIs it because the trees inside have been felled?\r\n\r\nWell, some say so, who know more than I.  But now go over the fence, and\r\nsee how many of these plants you can find on the moor.\r\n\r\nOh, I think I know.  I am so often on the moor.\r\n\r\nI think you would find more kinds outside than you fancy.  But what do\r\nyou know?\r\n\r\nThat beside some short fine grass about the cattle-paths, there are\r\nhardly any grasses on the moor save deer's hair and glade-grass; and all\r\nthe rest is heath, and moss, and furze, and fern.\r\n\r\nSoftly--not all; you have forgotten the bog plants; and there are (as I\r\nsaid) many more plants beside on the moor than you fancy.  But we will\r\nlook into that another time.  At all events, the plants outside are on\r\nthe whole quite different from the hay-field.\r\n\r\nOf course: that is what makes the field look green and the moor brown.\r\n\r\nNot a doubt.  They are so different, that they look like bits of two\r\ndifferent continents.  Scrambling over the fence is like scrambling out\r\nof Europe into Australia.  Now, how was that difference made?  Think.\r\nDon't guess, but think.  Why does the rich grass come up to the bank, and\r\nyet not spread beyond it?\r\n\r\nI suppose because it cannot get over.\r\n\r\nNot get over?  Would not the wind blow the seeds, and the birds carry\r\nthem?  They do get over, in millions, I don't doubt, every summer.\r\n\r\nThen why do they not grow?\r\n\r\nThink.\r\n\r\nIs there any difference in the soil inside and out?\r\n\r\nA very good guess.  But guesses are no use without facts.  Look.\r\n\r\nOh, I remember now.  I know now the soil of the field is brown, like the\r\ngarden; and the soil of the moor all black and peaty.\r\n\r\nYes.  But if you dig down two or three feet, you will find the soils of\r\nthe moor and the field just the same.  So perhaps the top soils were once\r\nboth alike.\r\n\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nWell, and what do you think about it now?  I want you to look and think.\r\nI want every one to look and think.  Half the misery in the world comes\r\nfirst from not looking, and then from not thinking.  And I do not want\r\nyou to be miserable.\r\n\r\nBut shall I be miserable if I do not find out such little things as this.\r\n\r\nYou will be miserable if you do not learn to understand little things:\r\nbecause then you will not be able to understand great things when you\r\nmeet them.  Children who are not trained to use their eyes and their\r\ncommon sense grow up the more miserable the cleverer they are.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause they grow up what men call dreamers, and bigots, and fanatics,\r\ncausing misery to themselves and to all who deal with them.  So I say\r\nagain, think.\r\n\r\nWell, I suppose men must have altered the soil inside the bank.\r\n\r\nWell done.  But why do you think so?\r\n\r\nBecause, of course, some one made the bank; and the brown soil only goes\r\nup to it.\r\n\r\nWell, that is something like common sense.  Now you will not say any\r\nmore, as the cows or the butterflies might, that the hay-field was always\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnd how did men change the soil?\r\n\r\nBy tilling it with the plough, to sweeten it, and manuring it, to make it\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nAnd then did all these beautiful grasses grow up of themselves?\r\n\r\nYou ought to know that they most likely did not.  You know the new\r\nenclosures?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nWell then, do rich grasses come up on them, now that they are broken up?\r\n\r\nOh no, nothing but groundsel, and a few weeds.\r\n\r\nJust what, I dare say, came up here at first.  But this land was tilled\r\nfor corn, for hundreds of years, I believe.  And just about one hundred\r\nyears ago it was laid down in grass; that is, sown with grass seeds.\r\n\r\nAnd where did men get the grass seeds from?\r\n\r\nAh, that is a long story; and one that shows our forefathers (though they\r\nknew nothing about railroads or electricity) were not such simpletons as\r\nsome folks think.  The way it must have been done was this.  Men watched\r\nthe natural pastures where cattle get fat on the wild grass, as they do\r\nin the Fens, and many other parts of England.  And then they saved the\r\nseeds of those fattening wild grasses, and sowed them in fresh spots.\r\nOften they made mistakes.  They were careless, and got weeds among the\r\nseed--like the buttercups, which do so much harm to this pasture.  Or\r\nthey sowed on soil which would not suit the seed, and it died.  But at\r\nlast, after many failures, they have grown so careful and so clever, that\r\nyou may send to certain shops, saying what sort of soil yours is, and\r\nthey will send you just the seeds which will grow there, and no other;\r\nand then you have a good pasture for as long as you choose to keep it\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAnd how is it kept good?\r\n\r\nLook at all those loads of hay, which are being carried off the field.  Do\r\nyou think you can take all that away without putting anything in its\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\nIf I took all the butter out of the churn, what must I do if I want more\r\nbutter still?\r\n\r\nPut more cream in.\r\n\r\nSo, if I want more grass to grow, I must put on the soil more of what\r\ngrass is made of.\r\n\r\nBut the butter don't grow, and the grass does.\r\n\r\nWhat does the grass grow in?\r\n\r\nThe soil.\r\n\r\nYes.  Just as the butter grows in the churn.  So you must put fresh grass-\r\nstuff continually into the soil, as you put fresh cream into the churn.\r\nYou have heard the farm men say, \"That crop has taken a good deal out of\r\nthe land\"?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThen they spoke exact truth.  What will that hay turn into by Christmas?\r\nCan't you tell?  Into milk, of course, which you will drink; and into\r\nhorseflesh too, which you will use.\r\n\r\nUse horseflesh?  Not eat it?\r\n\r\nNo; we have not got as far as that.  We did not even make up our minds to\r\ntaste the Cambridge donkey.  But every time the horse draws the carriage,\r\nhe uses up so much muscle; and that muscle he must get back again by\r\neating hay and corn; and that hay and corn must be put back again into\r\nthe land by manure, or there will be all the less for the horse next\r\nyear.  For one cannot eat one's cake and keep it too; and no more can one\r\neat one's grass.\r\n\r\nSo this field is a truly wonderful place.  It is no ugly pile of brick\r\nand mortar, with a tall chimney pouring out smoke and evil smells, with\r\nunhealthy, haggard people toiling inside.  Why do you look surprised?\r\n\r\nBecause--because nobody ever said it was.  You mean a manufactory.\r\n\r\nWell, and this hay-field is a manufactory: only like most of Madam How's\r\nworkshops, infinitely more beautiful, as well as infinitely more crafty,\r\nthan any manufactory of man's building.  It is beautiful to behold, and\r\nhealthy to work in; a joy and blessing alike to the eye, and the mind,\r\nand the body: and yet it is a manufactory.\r\n\r\nBut a manufactory of what?\r\n\r\nOf milk of course, and cows, and sheep, and horses; and of your body and\r\nmine--for we shall drink the milk and eat the meat.  And therefore it is\r\na flesh and milk manufactory.  We must put into it every year yard-stuff,\r\ntank-stuff, guano, bones, and anything and everything of that kin, that\r\nMadam How may cook it for us into grass, and cook the grass again into\r\nmilk and meat.  But if we don't give Madam How material to work on, we\r\ncannot expect her to work for us.  And what do you think will happen\r\nthen?  She will set to work for herself.  The rich grasses will dwindle\r\nfor want of ammonia (that is smelling salts), and the rich clovers for\r\nwant of phosphates (that is bone-earth): and in their places will come\r\nover the bank the old weeds and grass off the moor, which have not room\r\nto get in now, because the ground is coveted already.  They want no\r\nammonia nor phosphates--at all events they have none, and that is why the\r\ncattle on the moor never get fat.  So they can live where these rich\r\ngrasses cannot.  And then they will conquer and thrive; and the Field\r\nwill turn into Wild once more.\r\n\r\nAh, my child, thank God for your forefathers, when you look over that\r\nboundary mark.  For the difference between the Field and the Wild is the\r\ndifference between the old England of Madam How's making, and the new\r\nEngland which she has taught man to make, carrying on what she had only\r\nbegun and had not time to finish.\r\n\r\nThat moor is a pattern bit left to show what the greater part of this\r\nland was like for long ages after it had risen out of the sea; when there\r\nwas little or nothing on the flat upper moors save heaths, and ling, and\r\nclub-mosses, and soft gorse, and needle-whin, and creeping willows; and\r\nfurze and fern upon the brows; and in the bottoms oak and ash, beech and\r\nalder, hazel and mountain ash, holly and thorn, with here and there an\r\naspen or a buckthorn (berry-bearing alder as you call it), and\r\neverywhere--where he could thrust down his long root, and thrust up his\r\nlong shoots--that intruding conqueror and insolent tyrant, the bramble.\r\nThere were sedges and rushes, too, in the bogs, and coarse grass on the\r\nforest pastures--or \"leas\" as we call them to this day round here--but no\r\nreal green fields; and, I suspect, very few gay flowers, save in spring\r\nthe sheets of golden gorse, and in summer the purple heather.  Such was\r\nold England--or rather, such was this land before it was England; a far\r\nsadder, damper, poorer land than now.  For one man or one cow or sheep\r\nwhich could have lived on it then, a hundred can live now.  And yet, what\r\nit was once, that it might become again,--it surely would round here, if\r\nthis brave English people died out of it, and the land was left to itself\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen then, you may guess for yourself, from what you see\r\nhappen whenever the land is left to itself, as it is in the wood above.\r\nIn that wood you can still see the grass ridges and furrows which show\r\nthat it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late as the time of\r\nHenry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as you will read some\r\nday, was thrown out of tillage, to become forest and down once more.  And\r\nwhat is the mount now?  A jungle of oak and beech, cherry and holly,\r\nyoung and old all growing up together, with the mountain ash and bramble\r\nand furze coming up so fast beneath them, that we have to cut the paths\r\nclear again year by year.  Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old-\r\nworld plant, which only grows in ancient woods, has found its way back\r\nagain, I know not whence, and covers the open spaces with its pretty\r\nyellow and white flowers.  Man had conquered this mount, you see, from\r\nMadam How, hundreds of years ago.  And she always lets man conquer her,\r\nbecause Lady Why wishes man to conquer: only he must have a fair fight\r\nwith Madam How first, and try his strength against hers to the utmost.  So\r\nman conquered the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead of\r\nforest: but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to\r\nkeep what he had conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place\r\ninto her own hands, and bade the old forest trees and plants come back\r\nagain--as they would come if they were not stopped year by year, down\r\nfrom the wood, over the pastures--killing the rich grasses as they went,\r\ntill they met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for many\r\na year, till both made peace, and lived quietly side by side for ages.\r\n\r\nAnother forest coming up from below?  Where would it come from?\r\n\r\nFrom where it is now.  Come down and look along the brook, and every\r\ndrain and grip which runs into the brook.  What is here?\r\n\r\nSeedling alders, and some withies among them.\r\n\r\nVery well.  You know how we pull these alders up, and cut them down, and\r\nyet they continually come again.  Now, if we and all human beings were to\r\nleave this pasture for a few hundred years, would not those alders\r\nincrease into a wood?  Would they not kill the grass, and spread right\r\nand left, seeding themselves more and more as the grass died, and left\r\nthe ground bare, till they met the oaks and beeches coming down the hill?\r\nAnd then would begin a great fight, for years and years, between oak and\r\nbeech against alder and willow.\r\n\r\nBut how can trees fight?  Could they move or beat each other with their\r\nboughs?\r\n\r\nNot quite that; though they do beat each other with their boughs,\r\nfiercely enough, in a gale of wind; and then the trees who have strong\r\nand stiff boughs wound those who have brittle and limp boughs, and so\r\nhurt them, and if the storms come often enough, kill them.  But among\r\nthese trees in a sheltered valley the larger and stronger would kill the\r\nweaker and smaller by simply overshadowing their tops, and starving their\r\nroots; starving them, indeed, so much when they grow very thick, that the\r\npoor little acorns, and beech mast, and alder seeds would not be able to\r\nsprout at all.  So they would fight, killing each other's children, till\r\nthe war ended--I think I can guess how.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nThe beeches are as dainty as they are beautiful; and they do not like to\r\nget their feet wet.  So they would venture down the hill only as far as\r\nthe dry ground lasts, and those who tried to grow any lower would die.\r\nBut the oaks are hardy, and do not care much where they grow.  So they\r\nwould fight their way down into the wet ground among the alders and\r\nwillows, till they came to where their enemies were so thick and tall,\r\nthat the acorns as they fell could not sprout in the darkness.  And so\r\nyou would have at last, along the hill-side, a forest of beech and oak,\r\nlower down a forest of oak and alder, and along the stream-side alders\r\nand willows only.  And that would be a very fair example of the great law\r\nof the struggle for existence, which causes the competition of species.\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\nMadam How is very stern, though she is always perfectly just; and\r\ntherefore she makes every living thing fight for its life, and earn its\r\nbread, from its birth till its death; and rewards it exactly according to\r\nits deserts, and neither more nor less.\r\n\r\nAnd the competition of species means, that each thing, and kind of\r\nthings, has to compete against the things round it; and to see which is\r\nthe stronger; and the stronger live, and breed, and spread, and the\r\nweaker die out.\r\n\r\nBut that is very hard.\r\n\r\nI know it, my child, I know it.  But so it is.  And Madam How, no doubt,\r\nwould be often very clumsy and very cruel, without meaning it, because\r\nshe never sees beyond her own nose, or thinks at all about the\r\nconsequences of what she is doing.  But Lady Why, who does think about\r\nconsequences, is her mistress, and orders her about for ever.  And Lady\r\nWhy is, I believe, as loving as she is wise; and therefore we must trust\r\nthat she guides this great war between living things, and takes care that\r\nMadam How kills nothing which ought not to die, and takes nothing away\r\nwithout putting something more beautiful and something more useful in its\r\nplace; and that even if England were, which God forbid, overrun once more\r\nwith forests and bramble-brakes, that too would be of use somehow,\r\nsomewhere, somewhen, in the long ages which are to come hereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd you must remember, too, that since men came into the world with\r\nrational heads on their shoulders, Lady Why has been handing over more\r\nand more of Madam How's work to them, and some of her own work too: and\r\nbids them to put beautiful and useful things in the place of ugly and\r\nuseless ones; so that now it is men's own fault if they do not use their\r\nwits, and do by all the world what they have done by these\r\npastures--change it from a barren moor into a rich hay-field, by copying\r\nthe laws of Madam How, and making grass compete against heath.  But you\r\nlook thoughtful: what is it you want to know?\r\n\r\nWhy, you say all living things must fight and scramble for what they can\r\nget from each other: and must not I too?  For I am a living thing.\r\n\r\nAh, that is the old question, which our Lord answered long ago, and said,\r\n\"Be not anxious what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal\r\nyou shall be clothed.  For after all these things do the heathen seek,\r\nand your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.  But\r\nseek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these\r\nthings shall be added to you.\"  A few, very few, people have taken that\r\nadvice.  But they have been just the salt of the earth, which has kept\r\nmankind from decaying.\r\n\r\nBut what has that to do with it?\r\n\r\nSee.  You are a living thing, you say.  Are you a plant?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAre you an animal?\r\n\r\nI do not know.  Yes.  I suppose I am.  I eat, and drink, and sleep, just\r\nas dogs and cats do.\r\n\r\nYes.  There is no denying that.  No one knew that better than St. Paul\r\nwhen he told men that they had a flesh; that is, a body, and an animal's\r\nnature in them.  But St. Paul told them--of course he was not the first\r\nto say so, for all the wise heathens have known that--that there was\r\nsomething more in us, which he called a spirit.  Some call it now the\r\nmoral sentiment, some one thing, some another, but we will keep to the\r\nold word: we shall not find a better.\r\n\r\nYes, I know that I have a spirit, a soul.\r\n\r\nBetter to say that you are a spirit.  But what does St. Paul say?  That\r\nour spirit is to conquer our flesh, and keep it down.  That the man in\r\nus, in short, which is made in the likeness of God, is to conquer the\r\nanimal in us, which is made in the likeness of the dog and the cat, and\r\nsometimes (I fear) in the likeness of the ape or the pig.  You would not\r\nwish to be like a cat, much less like an ape or a pig?\r\n\r\nOf course not.\r\n\r\nThen do not copy them, by competing and struggling for existence against\r\nother people.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nDid you never watch the pigs feeding?\r\n\r\nYes, and how they grudge and quarrel, and shove each other's noses out of\r\nthe trough, and even bite each other because they are so jealous which\r\nshall get most.\r\n\r\nThat is it.  And how the biggest pig drives the others away, and would\r\nstarve them while he got fat, if the man did not drive him off in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nOh, yes; I know.\r\n\r\nThen no wiser than those pigs are worldly men who compete, and grudge,\r\nand struggle with each other, which shall get most money, most fame, most\r\npower over their fellow-men.  They will tell you, my child, that that is\r\nthe true philosophy, and the true wisdom; that competition is the natural\r\nlaw of society, and the source of wealth and prosperity.  Do not you\r\nlisten to them.  That is the wisdom of this world, which the flesh\r\nteaches the animals; and those who follow it, like the animals, will\r\nperish.  Such men are not even as wise as Sweep the retriever.\r\n\r\nNot as wise as Sweep?\r\n\r\nNot they.  Sweep will not take away Victor's bone, though he is ten times\r\nas big as Victor, and could kill him in a moment; and when he catches a\r\nrabbit, does he eat it himself?\r\n\r\nOf course not; he brings it and lays it down at our feet.\r\n\r\nBecause he likes better to do his duty, and be praised for it, than to\r\neat the rabbit, dearly as he longs to eat it.\r\n\r\nBut he is only an animal.  Who taught him to be generous, and dutiful,\r\nand faithful?\r\n\r\nWho, indeed!  Not we, you know that, for he has grown up with us since a\r\npuppy.  How he learnt it, and his parents before him, is a mystery, of\r\nwhich we can only say, God has taught them, we know not how.  But see\r\nwhat has happened--that just because dogs have learnt not to be selfish\r\nand to compete--that is, have become civilised and tame--therefore we let\r\nthem live with us, and love them.  Because they try to be good in their\r\nsimple way, therefore they too have all things added to them, and live\r\nfar happier, and more comfortable lives than the selfish wolf and fox.\r\n\r\nBut why have not all animals found out that?\r\n\r\nI cannot tell: there may be wise animals and foolish animals, as there\r\nare wise and foolish men.  Indeed there are.  I see a very wise animal\r\nthere, who never competes; for she has learned something of the golden\r\nlesson--that it is more blessed to give than to receive; and she acts on\r\nwhat she has learnt, all day long.\r\n\r\nWhich do you mean?  Why, that is a bee.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a bee: and I wish I were as worthy in my place as that bee is\r\nin hers.  I wish I could act up as well as she does to the true wisdom,\r\nwhich is self-sacrifice.  For whom is that bee working?  For herself?  If\r\nthat was all, she only needs to suck the honey as she goes.  But she is\r\nstoring up the wax under her stomach, and bee-bread in her thighs--for\r\nwhom?  Not for herself only, or even for her own children: but for the\r\nchildren of another bee, her queen.  For them she labours all day long,\r\nbuilds for them, feeds them, nurses them, spends her love and cunning on\r\nthem.  So does that ant on the path.  She is carrying home that stick to\r\nbuild for other ants' children.  So do the white ants in the tropics.\r\nThey have learnt not to compete, but to help each other; not to be\r\nselfish, but to sacrifice themselves; and therefore they are strong.\r\n\r\nBut you told me once that ants would fight and plunder each other's\r\nnests.  And once we saw two hives of bees fighting in the air, and\r\nfalling dead by dozens.\r\n\r\nMy child, do not men fight, and kill each other by thousands with sharp\r\nshot and cold steel, because, though they have learnt the virtue of\r\npatriotism, they have not yet learnt that of humanity?  We must not blame\r\nthe bees and ants if they are no wiser than men.  At least they are wise\r\nenough to stand up for their country, that is, their hive, and work for\r\nit, and die for it, if need be; and that makes them strong.\r\n\r\nBut how does that make them strong?\r\n\r\nHow, is a deep question, and one I can hardly answer yet.  But that it\r\nhas made them so there is no doubt.  Look at the solitary bees--the\r\ngovernors as we call them, who live in pairs, in little holes in the\r\nbanks.  How few of them there are; and they never seem to increase in\r\nnumbers.  Then look at the hive bees, how, just because they are\r\ncivilised,--that is, because they help each other, and feed each other,\r\ninstead of being solitary and selfish,--they breed so fast, and get so\r\nmuch food, that if they were not killed for their honey, they would soon\r\nbecome a nuisance, and drive us out of the parish.\r\n\r\nBut then we give them their hives ready made.\r\n\r\nTrue.  But in old forest countries, where trees decay and grow hollow,\r\nthe bees breed in them.\r\n\r\nYes.  I remember the bee tree in the fir avenue.\r\n\r\nWell then, in many forests in hot countries the bees swarm in hollow\r\ntrees; and they, and the ants, and the white ants, have it all their own\r\nway, and are lords and masters, driving the very wild beasts before them,\r\nwhile the ants and white ants eat up all gardens, and plantations, and\r\nclothes, and furniture; till it is a serious question whether in some hot\r\ncountries man will ever be able to settle, so strong have the ants grown,\r\nby ages of civilisation, and not competing against their brothers and\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nBut may I not compete for prizes against the other boys?\r\n\r\nWell, there is no harm in that; for you do not harm the others, even if\r\nyou win.  They will have learnt all the more, while trying for the prize;\r\nand so will you, even if you don't get it.  But I tell you fairly, trying\r\nfor prizes is only fit for a child; and when you become a man, you must\r\nput away childish things--competition among the rest.\r\n\r\nBut surely I may try to be better and wiser and more learned than\r\neverybody else?\r\n\r\nMy dearest child, why try for that?  Try to be as good, and wise, and\r\nlearned as you can, and if you find any man, or ten thousand men,\r\nsuperior to you, thank God for it.  Do you think that there can be too\r\nmuch wisdom in the world?\r\n\r\nOf course not: but I should like to be the wisest man in it.\r\n\r\nThen you would only have the heaviest burden of all men on your\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause you would be responsible for more foolish people than any one\r\nelse.  Remember what wise old Moses said, when some one came and told him\r\nthat certain men in the camp were prophesying--\"Would God all the Lord's\r\npeople did prophesy!\"  Yes; it would have saved Moses many a heartache,\r\nand many a sleepless night, if all the Jews had been wise as he was, and\r\nwiser still.  So do not you compete with good and wise men, but simply\r\ncopy them: and whatever you do, do not compete with the wolves, and the\r\napes, and the swine of this world; for that is a game at which you are\r\nsure to be beaten.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause Lady Why, if she loves you (as I trust she does), will take care\r\nthat you are beaten, lest you should fancy it was really profitable to\r\nlive like a cunning sort of animal, and not like a true man.  And how she\r\nwill do that I can tell you.  She will take care that you always come\r\nacross a worse man than you are trying to be,--a more apish man, who can\r\ntumble and play monkey-tricks for people's amusement better than you can;\r\nor a more swinish man, who can get at more of the pig's-wash than you\r\ncan; or a more wolfish man, who will eat you up if you do not get out of\r\nhis way; and so she will disappoint and disgust you, my child, with that\r\ngreedy, selfish, vain animal life, till you turn round and see your\r\nmistake, and try to live the true human life, which also is divine;--to\r\nbe just and honourable, gentle and forgiving, generous and useful--in one\r\nword, to fear God, and keep His commandments: and as you live that life,\r\nyou will find that, by the eternal laws of Lady Why, all other things\r\nwill be added to you; that people will be glad to know you, glad to help\r\nyou, glad to employ you, because they see that you will be of use to\r\nthem, and will do them no harm.  And if you meet (as you will meet) with\r\npeople better and wiser than yourself, then so much the better for you;\r\nfor they will love you, and be glad to teach you when they see that you\r\nare living the unselfish and harmless life; and that you come to them,\r\nnot as foolish Critias came to Socrates, to learn political cunning, and\r\nbecome a selfish and ambitious tyrant, but as wise Plato came, that he\r\nmight learn the laws of Lady Why, and love them for her sake, and teach\r\nthem to all mankind.  And so you, like the plants and animals, will get\r\nyour deserts exactly, without competing and struggling for existence as\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\nAnd all this has come out of looking at the hay-field and the wild moor.\r\n\r\nWhy not?  There is an animal in you, and there is a man in you.  If the\r\nanimal gets the upper hand, all your character will fall back into wild\r\nuseless moor; if the man gets the upper hand, all your character will be\r\ncultivated into rich and fertile field.  Choose.\r\n\r\nNow come down home.  The haymakers are resting under the hedge.  The\r\nhorses are dawdling home to the farm.  The sun is getting low, and the\r\nshadows long.  Come home, and go to bed while the house is fragrant with\r\nthe smell of hay, and dream that you are still playing among the\r\nhaycocks.  When you grow old, you will have other and sadder dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--THE WORLD'S END\r\n\r\n\r\nHullo! hi! wake up.  Jump out of bed, and come to the window, and see\r\nwhere you are.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful place!\r\n\r\nSo it is: though it is only poor old Ireland.  Don't you recollect that\r\nwhen we started I told you we were going to Ireland, and through it to\r\nthe World's End; and here we are now safe at the end of the old world,\r\nand beyond us the great Atlantic, and beyond that again, thousands of\r\nmiles away, the new world, which will be rich and prosperous, civilised\r\nand noble, thousands of years hence, when this old world, it may be, will\r\nbe dead, and little children there will be reading in their history books\r\nof Ancient England and of Ancient France, as you now read of Greece and\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nBut what a wonderful place it is!  What are those great green things\r\nstanding up in the sky, all over purple ribs and bars, with their tops\r\nhid in the clouds?\r\n\r\nThose are mountains; the bones of some old world, whose poor bare sides\r\nMadam How is trying to cover with rich green grass.\r\n\r\nAnd how far off are they?\r\n\r\nHow I should like to walk up to the top of that one which looks quite\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nYou will find it a long walk up there; three miles, I dare say, over\r\nblack bogs and banks of rock, and up corries and cliffs which you could\r\nnot climb.  There are plenty of cows on that mountain: and yet they look\r\nso small, you could not see them, nor I either, without a glass.  That\r\nlong white streak, zigzagging down the mountain side, is a roaring\r\ncataract of foam five hundred feet high, full now with last night's rain;\r\nbut by this afternoon it will have dwindled to a little thread; and to-\r\nmorrow, when you get up, if no more rain has come down, it will be gone.\r\nMadam How works here among the mountains swiftly and hugely, and\r\nsometimes terribly enough; as you shall see when you have had your\r\nbreakfast, and come down to the bridge with me.\r\n\r\nBut what a beautiful place it is!  Flowers and woods and a lawn; and what\r\nis that great smooth patch in the lawn just under the window?\r\n\r\nIs it an empty flower-bed?\r\n\r\nAh, thereby hangs a strange tale.  We will go and look at it after\r\nbreakfast, and then you shall see with your own eyes one of the wonders\r\nwhich I have been telling you of.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that shining between the trees?\r\n\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nIs it a lake?\r\n\r\nNot a lake, though there are plenty round here; that is salt water, not\r\nfresh.  Look away to the right, and you see it through the opening of the\r\nwoods again and again: and now look above the woods.  You see a faint\r\nblue line, and gray and purple lumps like clouds, which rest upon it far\r\naway.  That, child, is the great Atlantic Ocean, and those are islands in\r\nthe far west.  The water which washes the bottom of the lawn was but a\r\nfew months ago pouring out of the Gulf of Mexico, between the Bahamas and\r\nFlorida, and swept away here as the great ocean river of warm water which\r\nwe call the Gulf Stream, bringing with it out of the open ocean the\r\nshoals of mackerel, and the porpoises and whales which feed upon them.\r\nSome fine afternoon we will run down the bay and catch strange fishes,\r\nsuch as you never saw before, and very likely see a living whale.\r\n\r\nWhat? such a whale as they get whalebone from, and which eats sea-moths?\r\n\r\nNo, they live far north, in the Arctic circle; these are grampuses, and\r\nbottle-noses, which feed on fish; not so big as the right whales, but\r\nquite big enough to astonish you, if one comes up and blows close to the\r\nboat.  Get yourself dressed and come down, and then we will go out; we\r\nshall have plenty to see and talk of at every step.\r\n\r\nNow, you have finished your breakfast at last, so come along, and we\r\nshall see what we shall see.  First run out across the gravel, and\r\nscramble up that bank of lawn, and you will see what you fancied was an\r\nempty flower-bed.\r\n\r\nWhy, it is all hard rock.\r\n\r\nAh, you are come into the land of rocks now: out of the land of sand and\r\ngravel; out of a soft young corner of the world into a very hard, old,\r\nweather-beaten corner; and you will see rocks enough, and too many for\r\nthe poor farmers, before you go home again.\r\n\r\nBut how beautifully smooth and flat the rock is: and yet it is all\r\nrounded.\r\n\r\nWhat is it like?\r\n\r\nLike--like the half of a shell.\r\n\r\nNot badly said, but think again.\r\n\r\nLike--like--I know what it is like.  Like the back of some great monster\r\npeeping up through the turf.\r\n\r\nYou have got it.  Such rocks as these are called in Switzerland \"roches\r\nmoutonnees,\" because they are, people fancy, like sheep's backs.  Now\r\nlook at the cracks and layers in it.  They run across the stone; they\r\nhave nothing to do with the shape of it.  You see that?\r\n\r\nYes: but here are cracks running across them, all along the stone, till\r\nthe turf hides them.\r\n\r\nLook at them again; they are no cracks; they do not go into the stone.\r\n\r\nI see.  They are scratched; something like those on the elder-stem at\r\nhome, where the cats sharpen their claws.  But it would take a big cat to\r\nmake them.\r\n\r\nDo you recollect what I told you of Madam How's hand, more flexible than\r\nany hand of man, and yet strong enough to grind the mountains into paste?\r\n\r\nI know.  Ice! ice! ice!  But are these really ice-marks?\r\n\r\nChild, on the place where we now stand, over rich lawns, and warm woods,\r\nand shining lochs, lay once on a time hundreds, it may be thousands, of\r\nfeet of solid ice, crawling off yonder mountain-tops into the ocean there\r\noutside; and this is one of its tracks.  See how the scratches all point\r\nstraight down the valley, and straight out to sea.  Those mountains are\r\n2000 feet high: but they were much higher once; for the ice has planed\r\nthe tops off them.  Then, it seems to me, the ice sank, and left the\r\nmountains standing out of it about half their height, and at that level\r\nit stayed, till it had planed down all those lower moors of smooth bare\r\nrock between us and the Western ocean; and then it sank again, and\r\ndwindled back, leaving moraines (that is, heaps of dirt and stones) all\r\nup these valleys here and there, till at the last it melted all away, and\r\npoor old Ireland became fit to live in again.  We will go down the bay\r\nsome day and look at those moraines, some of them quite hills of earth,\r\nand then you will see for yourself how mighty a chisel the ice-chisel\r\nwas, and what vast heaps of chips it has left behind.  Now then, down\r\nover the lawn towards the bridge.  Listen to the river, louder and louder\r\nevery step we take.\r\n\r\nWhat a roar!  Is there a waterfall there?\r\n\r\nNo.  It is only the flood.  And underneath the roar of that flood, do you\r\nnot hear a deeper note--a dull rumbling, as if from underground?\r\n\r\nYes.  What is it?\r\n\r\nThe rolling of great stones under water, which are being polished against\r\neach other, as they hurry toward the sea.  Now, up on the parapet of the\r\nbridge.  I will hold you tight.  Look and see Madam How's rain-spade at\r\nwork.  Look at the terrible yellow torrent below us, almost filling up\r\nthe arches of the bridge, and leaping high in waves and crests of foam.\r\n\r\nOh, the bridge is falling into the water!\r\n\r\nNot a bit.  You are not accustomed to see water running below you at ten\r\nmiles an hour.  Never mind that feeling.  It will go off in a few\r\nseconds.  Look; the water is full six feet up the trunks of the trees;\r\nover the grass and the king fern, and the tall purple loose-strife--\r\n\r\nOh!  Here comes a tree dancing down!\r\n\r\nAnd there are some turfs which have been cut on the mountain.  And there\r\nis a really sad sight.  Look what comes now.\r\n\r\nOne--two--three.\r\n\r\nWhy, they are sheep.\r\n\r\nYes.  And a sad loss they will be to some poor fellow in the glen above.\r\n\r\nAnd oh!  Look at the pig turning round and round solemnly in the corner\r\nunder the rock.  Poor piggy!  He ought to have been at home safe in his\r\nstye, and not wandering about the hills.  And what are these coming now?\r\n\r\nButter firkins, I think.  Yes.  This is a great flood.  It is well if\r\nthere are no lives lost.\r\n\r\nBut is it not cruel of Madam How to make such floods?\r\n\r\nWell--let us ask one of these men who are looking over the bridge.\r\n\r\nWhy, what does he say?  I cannot understand one word.  Is he talking\r\nIrish?\r\n\r\nIrish-English at least: but what he said was, that it was a mighty fine\r\nflood entirely, praised be God; and would help on the potatoes and oats\r\nafter the drought, and set the grass growing again on the mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd what is he saying now?\r\n\r\nThat the river will be full of salmon and white trout after this.\r\n\r\nWhat does he mean?\r\n\r\nThat under our feet now, if we could see through the muddy water, dozens\r\nof salmon and sea-trout are running up from the sea.\r\n\r\nWhat! up this furious stream?\r\n\r\nYes.  What would be death to you is pleasure and play to them.  Up they\r\nare going, to spawn in the little brooks among the mountains; and all of\r\nthem are the best of food, fattened on the herrings and sprats in the sea\r\noutside, Madam How's free gift, which does not cost man a farthing, save\r\nthe expense of nets and rods to catch them.\r\n\r\nHow can that be?\r\n\r\nI will give you a bit of political economy.  Suppose a pound of salmon is\r\nworth a shilling; and a pound of beef is worth a shilling likewise.\r\nBefore we can eat the beef, it has cost perhaps tenpence to make that\r\npound of beef out of turnips and grass and oil-cake; and so the country\r\nis only twopence a pound richer for it.  But Mr. Salmon has made himself\r\nout of what he eats in the sea, and so has cost nothing; and the shilling\r\na pound is all clear gain.  There--you don't quite understand that piece\r\nof political economy.  Indeed, it is only in the last two or three years\r\nthat older heads than yours have got to understand it, and have passed\r\nthe wise new salmon laws, by which the rivers will be once more as rich\r\nwith food as the land is, just as they were hundreds of years ago.  But\r\nnow, look again at the river.  What do you think makes it so yellow and\r\nmuddy?\r\n\r\nDirt, of course.\r\n\r\nAnd where does that come from?\r\n\r\nOff the mountains?\r\n\r\nYes.  Tons on tons of white mud are being carried down past us now; and\r\nwhere will they go?\r\n\r\nInto the sea?\r\n\r\nYes, and sink there in the still water, to make new strata at the bottom;\r\nand perhaps in them, ages hence, some one will find the bones of those\r\nsheep, and of poor Mr. Pig too, fossil--\r\n\r\nAnd the butter firkins too.  What fun to find a fossil butter firkin!\r\n\r\nBut now lift up your eyes to the jagged mountain crests, and their dark\r\nsides all laced with silver streams.  Out of every crack and cranny there\r\naloft, the rain is bringing down dirt, and stones too, which have been\r\nsplit off by the winter's frosts, deepening every little hollow, and\r\nsharpening every peak, and making the hills more jagged and steep year by\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice went away, the hills were all scraped smooth and round by\r\nthe glaciers, like the flat rock upon the lawn; and ugly enough they must\r\nhave looked, most like great brown buns.  But ever since then, Madam How\r\nhas been scooping them out again by her water-chisel into deep glens,\r\nmighty cliffs, sharp peaks, such as you see aloft, and making the old\r\nhills beautiful once more.  Why, even the Alps in Switzerland have been\r\ncarved out by frost and rain, out of some great flat.  The very peak of\r\nthe Matterhorn, of which you have so often seen a picture, is but one\r\nsingle point left of some enormous bun of rock.  All the rest has been\r\ncarved away by rain and frost; and some day the Matterhorn itself will be\r\ncarved away, and its last stone topple into the glacier at its foot.  See,\r\nas we have been talking, we have got into the woods.\r\n\r\nOh, what beautiful woods, just like our own.\r\n\r\nNot quite.  There are some things growing here which do not grow at home,\r\nas you will soon see.  And there are no rocks at home, either, as there\r\nare here.\r\n\r\nHow strange, to see trees growing out of rocks!  How do their roots get\r\ninto the stone?\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of rich mould in the cracks for them to feed on--\r\n\r\n   \"Health to the oak of the mountains; he trusts to the might of the\r\n   rock-clefts.\r\n   Deeply he mines, and in peace feeds on the wealth of the stone.\"\r\n\r\nHow many sorts of trees there are--oak, and birch and nuts, and mountain-\r\nash, and holly and furze, and heather.\r\n\r\nAnd if you went to some of the islands in the lake up in the glen, you\r\nwould find wild arbutus--strawberry-tree, as you call it.  We will go and\r\nget some one day or other.\r\n\r\nHow long and green the grass is, even on the rocks, and the ferns, and\r\nthe moss, too.  Everything seems richer here than at home.\r\n\r\nOf course it is.  You are here in the land of perpetual spring, where\r\nfrost and snow seldom, or never comes.\r\n\r\nOh, look at the ferns under this rock!  I must pick some.\r\n\r\nPick away.  I will warrant you do not pick all the sorts.\r\n\r\nYes.  I have got them all now.\r\n\r\nNot so hasty, child; there is plenty of a beautiful fern growing among\r\nthat moss, which you have passed over.  Look here.\r\n\r\nWhat! that little thing a fern!\r\n\r\nHold it up to the light, and see.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely little thing, like a transparent sea-weed, hung on black\r\nwire.  What is it?\r\n\r\nFilm fern, Hymenophyllum.  But what are you staring at now, with all your\r\neyes?\r\n\r\nOh! that rock covered with green stars and a cloud of little white and\r\npink flowers growing out of them.\r\n\r\nAha! my good little dog!  I thought you would stand to that game when you\r\nfound it.\r\n\r\nWhat is it, though?\r\n\r\nYou must answer that yourself.  You have seen it a hundred times before.\r\n\r\nWhy, it is London Pride, that grows in the garden at home.\r\n\r\nOf course it is: but the Irish call it St. Patrick's cabbage; though it\r\ngot here a long time before St. Patrick; and St. Patrick must have been\r\nvery short of garden-stuff if he ever ate it.\r\n\r\nBut how did it get here from London?\r\n\r\nNo, no.  How did it get to London from hence?  For from this country it\r\ncame.  I suppose the English brought it home in Queen Bess's or James the\r\nFirst's time.\r\n\r\nBut if it is wild here, and will grow so well in England, why do we not\r\nfind it wild in England too?\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that there are no toads or snakes in Ireland.  They\r\nhad not got as far as Ireland before Ireland was parted off from England.\r\nAnd St. Patrick's cabbage, and a good many other plants, had not got as\r\nfar as England.\r\n\r\nBut why?\r\n\r\nWhy, I don't know.  But this I know: that when Madam How makes a new sort\r\nof plant or animal, she starts it in one single place, and leaves it to\r\ntake care of itself and earn its own living--as she does you and me and\r\nevery one--and spread from that place all round as far as it can go.  So\r\nSt. Patrick's cabbage got into this south-west of Ireland, long, long\r\nago; and was such a brave sturdy little plant, that it clambered up to\r\nthe top of the highest mountains, and over all the rocks.  But when it\r\ngot to the rich lowlands to the eastward, in county Cork, it found all\r\nthe ground taken up already with other plants; and as they had enough to\r\ndo to live themselves, they would not let St. Patrick's cabbage settle\r\namong them; and it had to be content with living here in the\r\nfar-west--and, what was very sad, had no means of sending word to its\r\nbrothers and sisters in the Pyrenees how it was getting on.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?  Are you making fun of me?\r\n\r\nNot the least.  I am only telling you a very strange story, which is\r\nliterally true.  Come, and sit down on this bench.  You can't catch that\r\ngreat butterfly, he is too strong on the wing for you.\r\n\r\nBut oh, what a beautiful one!\r\n\r\nYes, orange and black, silver and green, a glorious creature.  But you\r\nmay see him at home sometimes: that plant close to you, you cannot see at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhy, it is only great spurge, such as grows in the woods at home.\r\n\r\nNo.  It is Irish spurge which grows here, and sometimes in Devonshire,\r\nand then again in the west of Europe, down to the Pyrenees.  Don't touch\r\nit.  Our wood spurge is poisonous enough, but this is worse still; if you\r\nget a drop of its milk on your lip or eye, you will be in agonies for\r\nhalf a day.  That is the evil plant with which the poachers kill the\r\nsalmon.\r\n\r\nHow do they do that?\r\n\r\nWhen the salmon are spawning up in the little brooks, and the water is\r\nlow, they take that spurge, and grind it between two stones under water,\r\nand let the milk run down into the pool; and at that all the poor salmon\r\nturn up dead.  Then comes the water-bailiff, and catches the poachers.\r\nThen comes the policeman, with his sword at his side and his truncheon\r\nunder his arm: and then comes a \"cheap journey\" to Tralee Gaol, in which\r\nthose foolish poachers sit and reconsider themselves, and determine not\r\nto break the salmon laws--at least till next time.\r\n\r\nBut why is it that this spurge, and St. Patrick's cabbage, grow only here\r\nin the west?  If they got here of themselves, where did they come from?\r\nAll outside there is sea; and they could not float over that.\r\n\r\nCome, I say, and sit down on this bench, and I will tell you a tale,--the\r\nstory of the Old Atlantis, the sunken land in the far West.  Old Plato,\r\nthe Greek, told legends of it, which you will read some day; and now it\r\nseems as if those old legends had some truth in them, after all.  We are\r\nstanding now on one of the last remaining scraps of the old Atlantic\r\nland.  Look down the bay.  Do you see far away, under, the mountains,\r\nlittle islands, long and low?\r\n\r\nOh, yes.\r\n\r\nSome of these are old slate, like the mountains; others are limestone;\r\nbits of the old coral-reef to the west of Ireland which became dry land.\r\n\r\nI know.  You told me about it.\r\n\r\nThen that land, which is all eaten up by the waves now, once joined\r\nIreland to Cornwall, and to Spain, and to the Azores, and I suspect to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and what is stranger, to Labrador, on the coast of\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\nOh!  How can you know that?\r\n\r\nListen, and I will give you your first lesson in what I call Bio-geology.\r\n\r\nWhat a long word!\r\n\r\nIf you can find a shorter one I shall be very much obliged to you, for I\r\nhate long words.  But what it means is,--Telling how the land has changed\r\nin shape, by the plants and animals upon it.  And if you ever read (as\r\nyou will) Mr. Wallace's new book on the Indian Archipelago, you will see\r\nwhat wonderful discoveries men may make about such questions if they will\r\nbut use their common sense.  You know the common pink heather--ling, as\r\nwe call it?\r\n\r\nOf course.\r\n\r\nThen that ling grows, not only here and in the north and west of Europe,\r\nbut in the Azores too; and, what is more strange, in Labrador.  Now, as\r\nling can neither swim nor fly, does not common sense tell you that all\r\nthose countries were probably joined together in old times?\r\n\r\nWell: but it seems so strange.\r\n\r\nSo it is, my child; and so is everything.  But, as the fool says in\r\nShakespeare--\r\n\r\n   \"A long time ago the world began,\r\n   With heigh ho, the wind and the rain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the wind and the rain have made strange work with the poor old world\r\never since.  And that is about all that we, who are not very much wiser\r\nthan Shakespeare's fool, can say about the matter.  But again--the London\r\nPride grows here, and so does another saxifrage very like it, which we\r\ncall Saxifraga Geum.  Now, when I saw those two plants growing in the\r\nWestern Pyrenees, between France and Spain, and with them the beautiful\r\nblue butterwort, which grows in these Kerry bogs--we will go and find\r\nsome--what could I say but that Spain and Ireland must have been joined\r\nonce?\r\n\r\nI suppose it must be so.\r\n\r\nAgain.  There is a little pink butterwort here in the bogs, which grows,\r\ntoo, in dear old Devonshire and Cornwall; and also in the south-west of\r\nScotland.  Now, when I found that too, in the bogs near Biarritz, close\r\nto the Pyrenees, and knew that it stretched away along the Spanish coast,\r\nand into Portugal, what could my common sense lead me to say but that\r\nScotland, and Ireland, and Cornwall, and Spain were all joined once?\r\nThose are only a few examples.  I could give you a dozen more.  For\r\ninstance, on an island away there to the west, and only in one spot,\r\nthere grows a little sort of lily, which is found I believe in Brittany,\r\nand on the Spanish and Portuguese heaths, and even in North-west Africa.\r\nAnd that Africa and Spain were joined not so very long ago at the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar there is no doubt at all.\r\n\r\nBut where did the Mediterranean Sea run out then?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it did not run out at all; but was a salt-water lake, like the\r\nCaspian, or the Dead Sea.  Perhaps it ran out over what is now the\r\nSahara, the great desert of sand, for, that was a sea-bottom not long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nBut then, how was this land of Atlantis joined to the Cape of Good Hope?\r\n\r\nI cannot say how, or when either.  But this is plain: the place in the\r\nworld where the most beautiful heaths grow is the Cape of Good Hope?  You\r\nknow I showed you Cape heaths once at the nursery gardener's at home.\r\n\r\nOh yes, pink, and yellow, and white; so much larger than ours.\r\n\r\nThen it seems (I only say it seems) as if there must have been some land\r\nonce to the westward, from which the different sorts of heath spread\r\nsouth-eastward to the Cape, and north-eastward into Europe.  And that\r\nthey came north-eastward into Europe seems certain; for there are no\r\nheaths in America or Asia.\r\n\r\nBut how north-eastward?\r\n\r\nThink.  Stand with your face to the south and think.  If a thing comes\r\nfrom the south-west--from there, it must go to the north-east-towards\r\nthere.  Must it not?\r\n\r\nOh yes, I see.\r\n\r\nNow then--The farther you go south-west, towards Spain, the more kinds of\r\nheath there are, and the handsomer; as if their original home, from which\r\nthey started, was somewhere down there.\r\n\r\nMore sorts!  What sorts?\r\n\r\nHow many sorts of heath have we at home?\r\n\r\nThree, of course: ling, and purple heath, and bottle heath.\r\n\r\nAnd there are no more in all England, or Wales, or Scotland, except--Now,\r\nlisten.  In the very farthest end of Cornwall there are two more sorts,\r\nthe Cornish heath and the Orange-bell; and they say (though I never saw\r\nit) that the Orange-bell grows near Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nWell.  That is south and west too.\r\n\r\nSo it is: but that makes five heaths.  Now in the south and west of\r\nIreland all these five heaths grow, and two more: the great Irish heath,\r\nwith purple bells, and the Mediterranean heath, which flowers in spring.\r\n\r\nOh, I know them.  They grow in the Rhododendron beds at home.\r\n\r\nOf course.  Now again.  If you went down to Spain, you would find all\r\nthose seven heaths, and other sorts with them, and those which are rare\r\nin England and Ireland are common there.  About Biarritz, on the Spanish\r\nfrontier, all the moors are covered with Cornish heath, and the bogs with\r\nOrange-bell, and lovely they are to see; and growing among them is a tall\r\nheath six feet high, which they call there _bruyere_, or Broomheath,\r\nbecause they make brooms of it: and out of its roots the \"briar-root\"\r\npipes are made.  There are other heaths about that country, too, whose\r\nnames I do not know; so that when you are there, you fancy yourself in\r\nthe very home of the heaths: but you are not.  They must have come from\r\nsome land near where the Azores are now; or how could heaths have got\r\npast Africa, and the tropics, to the Cape of Good Hope?\r\n\r\nIt seems very wonderful, to be able to find out that there was a great\r\nland once in the ocean all by a few little heaths.\r\n\r\nNot by them only, child.  There are many other plants, and animals too,\r\nwhich make one think that so it must have been.  And now I will tell you\r\nsomething stranger still.  There may have been a time--some people say\r\nthat there must--when Africa and South America were joined by land.\r\n\r\nAfrica and South America!  Was that before the heaths came here, or\r\nafter?\r\n\r\nI cannot tell: but I think, probably after.  But this is certain, that\r\nthere must have been a time when figs, and bamboos, and palms, and\r\nsarsaparillas, and many other sorts of plants could get from Africa to\r\nAmerica, or the other way, and indeed almost round the world.  About the\r\nsouth of France and Italy you will see one beautiful sarsaparilla, with\r\nhooked prickles, zigzagging and twining about over rocks and ruins,\r\ntrunks and stems: and when you do, if you have understanding, it will\r\nseem as strange to you as it did to me to remember that the home of the\r\nsarsaparillas is not in Europe, but in the forests of Brazil, and the\r\nRiver Plate.\r\n\r\nOh, I have heard about their growing there, and staining the rivers\r\nbrown, and making them good medicine to drink: but I never thought there\r\nwere any in Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are only one or two, and how they got there is a marvel indeed.  But\r\nnow--If there was not dry land between Africa and South America, how did\r\nthe cats get into America?  For they cannot swim.\r\n\r\nCats?  People might have brought them over.\r\n\r\nJaguars and Pumas, which you read of in Captain Mayne Reid's books, are\r\ncats, and so are the Ocelots or tiger cats.\r\n\r\nOh, I saw them at the Zoological Gardens.\r\n\r\nBut no one would bring them over, I should think, except to put them in\r\nthe Zoo.\r\n\r\nNot unless they were very foolish.\r\n\r\nAnd much stronger and cleverer than the savages of South America.  No,\r\nthose jaguars and pumus have been in America for ages: and there are\r\nthose who will tell you--and I think they have some reason on their\r\nside--that the jaguar, with his round patches of spots, was once very\r\nmuch the same as the African and Indian leopard, who can climb trees\r\nwell.  So when he got into the tropic forests of America, he took to the\r\ntrees, and lived among the branches, feeding on sloths and monkeys, and\r\nnever coming to the ground for weeks, till he grew fatter and stronger\r\nand far more terrible than his forefathers.  And they will tell you, too,\r\nthat the puma was, perhaps--I only say perhaps--something like the lion,\r\nwho (you know) has no spots.  But when he got into the forests, he found\r\nvery little food under the trees, only a very few deer; and so he was\r\nstarved, and dwindled down to the poor little sheep-stealing rogue he is\r\nnow, of whom nobody is afraid.\r\n\r\nOh, yes!  I remember now A. said he and his men killed six in one day.\r\nBut do you think it is all true about the pumas and jaguars?\r\n\r\nMy child, I don't say that it is true: but only that it is likely to be\r\ntrue.  In science we must be cautious and modest, and ready to alter our\r\nminds whenever we learn fresh facts; only keeping sure of one thing, that\r\nthe truth, when we find it out, will be far more wonderful than any\r\nnotions of ours.  See!  As we have been talking we have got nearly home:\r\nand luncheon must be ready.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWhy are you opening your eyes at me like the dog when he wants to go out\r\nwalking?\r\n\r\nBecause I want to go out.  But I don't want to go out walking.  I want to\r\ngo in the yacht.\r\n\r\nIn the yacht?  It does not belong to me.\r\n\r\nOh, that is only fun.  I know everybody is going out in it to see such a\r\nbeautiful island full of ferns, and have a picnic on the rocks; and I\r\nknow you are going.\r\n\r\nThen you know more than I do myself.\r\n\r\nBut I heard them say you were going.\r\n\r\nThen they know more than I do myself.\r\n\r\nBut would you not like to go?\r\n\r\nI might like to go very much indeed; but as I have been knocked about at\r\nsea a good deal, and perhaps more than I intend to be again, it is no\r\nnovelty to me, and there might be other things which I liked still\r\nbetter: for instance, spending the afternoon with you.\r\n\r\nThen am I not to go?\r\n\r\nI think not.  Don't pull such a long face: but be a man, and make up your\r\nmind to it, as the geese do to going barefoot.\r\n\r\nBut why may I not go?\r\n\r\nBecause I am not Madam How, but your Daddy.\r\n\r\nWhat can that have to do with it?\r\n\r\nIf you asked Madam How, do you know what she would answer in a moment, as\r\ncivilly and kindly as could be?  She would say--Oh yes, go by all means,\r\nand please yourself, my pretty little man.  My world is the Paradise\r\nwhich the Irishman talked of, in which \"a man might do what was right in\r\nthe sight of his own eyes, and what was wrong too, as he liked it.\"\r\n\r\nThen Madam How would let me go in the yacht?\r\n\r\nOf course she would, or jump overboard when you were in it; or put your\r\nfinger in the fire, and your head afterwards; or eat Irish spurge, and\r\ndie like the salmon; or anything else you liked.  Nobody is so indulgent\r\nas Madam How: and she would be the dearest old lady in the world, but for\r\none ugly trick that she has.  She never tells any one what is coming, but\r\nleaves them to find it out for themselves.  She lets them put their\r\nfingers in the fire, and never tells them that they will get burnt.\r\n\r\nBut that is very cruel and treacherous of her.\r\n\r\nMy boy, our business is not to call hard names, but to take things as we\r\nfind them, as the Highlandman said when he ate the braxy mutton.  Now\r\nshall I, because I am your Daddy, tell you what Madam How would not have\r\ntold you?  When you get on board the yacht, you will think it all very\r\npleasant for an hour, as long as you are in the bay.  But presently you\r\nwill get a little bored, and run about the deck, and disturb people, and\r\nwant to sit here, there, and everywhere, which I should not like.  And\r\nwhen you get beyond that headland, you will find the great rollers coming\r\nin from the Atlantic, and the cutter tossing and heaving as you never\r\nfelt before, under a burning sun.  And then my merry little young\r\ngentleman will begin to feel a little sick; and then very sick, and more\r\nmiserable than he ever felt in his life; and wish a thousand times over\r\nthat he was safe at home, even doing sums in long division; and he will\r\ngive a great deal of trouble to various kind ladies--which no one has a\r\nright to do, if he can help it.\r\n\r\nOf course I do not wish to be sick: only it looks such beautiful weather.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is: but don't fancy that last night's rain and wind can have\r\npassed without sending in such a swell as will frighten you, when you see\r\nthe cutter climbing up one side of a wave, and running down the other;\r\nMadam How tells me that, though she will not tell you yet.\r\n\r\nThen why do they go out?\r\n\r\nBecause they are accustomed to it.  They have come hither all round from\r\nCowes, past the Land's End, and past Cape Clear, and they are not afraid\r\nor sick either.  But shall I tell you how you would end this evening?--at\r\nleast so I suspect.  Lying miserable in a stuffy cabin, on a sofa, and\r\nnot quite sure whether you were dead or alive, till you were bundled into\r\na boat about twelve o'clock at night, when you ought to be safe asleep,\r\nand come home cold, and wet, and stupid, and ill, and lie in bed all to-\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nBut will they be wet and cold?\r\n\r\nI cannot be sure; but from the look of the sky there to westward, I think\r\nsome of them will be.  So do you make up your mind to stay with me.  But\r\nif it is fine and smooth to-morrow, perhaps we may row down the bay, and\r\nsee plenty of wonderful things.\r\n\r\nBut why is it that Madam How will not tell people beforehand what will\r\nhappen to them, as you have told me?\r\n\r\nNow I will tell you a great secret, which, alas! every one has not found\r\nout yet.  Madam How will teach you, but only by experience.  Lady Why\r\nwill teach you, but by something very different--by something which has\r\nbeen called--and I know no better names for it--grace and inspiration; by\r\nputting into your heart feelings which no man, not even your father and\r\nmother, can put there; by making you quick to love what is right, and\r\nhate what is wrong, simply because they are right and wrong, though you\r\ndon't know why they are right and wrong; by making you teachable, modest,\r\nreverent, ready to believe those who are older and wiser than you when\r\nthey tell you what you could never find out for yourself: and so you will\r\nbe prudent, that is provident, foreseeing, and know what will happen if\r\nyou do so-and-so; and therefore what is really best and wisest for you.\r\n\r\nBut why will she be kind enough to do that for me?\r\n\r\nFor the very same reason that I do it.  For God's sake.  Because God is\r\nyour Father in heaven, as I am your father on earth, and He does not wish\r\nHis little child to be left to the hard teaching of Nature and Law, but\r\nto be helped on by many, many unsought and undeserved favours, such as\r\nare rightly called \"Means of Grace;\" and above all by the Gospel and good\r\nnews that you are God's child, and that God loves you, and has helped and\r\ntaught you, and will help you and teach you, in a thousand ways of which\r\nyou are not aware, if only you will be a wise child, and listen to Lady\r\nWhy, when she cries from her Palace of Wisdom, and the feast which she\r\nhas prepared, \"Whoso is simple let him turn in hither;\" and says to him\r\nwho wants understanding--\"Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine\r\nwhich I have mingled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.\r\nBy me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  By me princes rule, and\r\nnobles, even all the judges of the earth.  I love them that love me; and\r\nthose that seek me early shall find me.  Riches and honour are with me;\r\nyea, durable riches and righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nYes, I will try and listen to Lady Why: but what will happen if I do not?\r\n\r\nThat will happen to you, my child--but God forbid it ever should\r\nhappen--which happens to wicked kings and rulers, and all men, even the\r\ngreatest and cleverest, if they do not choose to reign by Lady Why's\r\nlaws, and decree justice according to her eternal ideas of what is just,\r\nbut only do what seems pleasant and profitable to themselves.  On them\r\nLady Why turns round, and says--for she, too, can be awful, ay dreadful,\r\nwhen she needs--\r\n\r\n\"Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and\r\nno man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have\r\nnone of my reproof--\"  And then come words so terrible, that I will not\r\nspeak them here in this happy place: but what they mean is this:--\r\n\r\nThat these foolish people are handed over--as you and I shall be if we do\r\nwrong wilfully--to Madam How and her terrible school-house, which is\r\ncalled Nature and the Law, to be treated just as the plants and animals\r\nare treated, because they did not choose to behave like men and children\r\nof God.  And there they learn, whether they like or not, what they might\r\nhave learnt from Lady Why all along.  They learn the great law, that as\r\nmen sow so they will reap; as they make their bed so they will lie on it:\r\nand Madam How can teach that as no one else can in earth or heaven: only,\r\nunfortunately for her scholars, she is apt to hit so hard with her rod,\r\nwhich is called Experience, that they never get over it; and therefore\r\nmost of those who will only be taught by Nature and Law are killed, poor\r\ncreatures, before they have learnt their lesson; as many a savage tribe\r\nis destroyed, ay and great and mighty nations too--the old Roman Empire\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nAnd the poor Jews, who were carried away captive to Babylon?\r\n\r\nYes; they would not listen to Lady Why, and so they were taken in hand by\r\nMadam How, and were seventy years in her terrible school-house, learning\r\na lesson which, to do them justice, they never forgot again.  But now we\r\nwill talk of something pleasanter.  We will go back to Lady Why, and\r\nlisten to her voice.  It sounds gentle and cheerful enough just now.\r\nListen.\r\n\r\nWhat? is she speaking to us now?\r\n\r\nHush! open your eyes and ears once more, for you are growing sleepy with\r\nmy long sermon.  Watch the sleepy shining water, and the sleepy green\r\nmountains.  Listen to the sleepy lapping of the ripple, and the sleepy\r\nsighing of the woods, and let Lady Why talk to you through them in \"songs\r\nwithout words,\" because they are deeper than all words, till you, too,\r\nfall asleep with your head upon my knee.\r\n\r\nBut what does she say?\r\n\r\nShe says--\"Be still.  The fulness of joy is peace.\"  There, you are fast\r\nasleep; and perhaps that is the best thing for you; for sleep will (so I\r\nam informed, though I never saw it happen, nor any one else) put fresh\r\ngray matter into your brain; or save the wear and tear of the old gray\r\nmatter; or something else--when they have settled what it is to do: and\r\nif so, you will wake up with a fresh fiddle-string to your little fiddle\r\nof a brain, on which you are playing new tunes all day long.  So much the\r\nbetter: but when I believe that your brain is you, pretty boy, then I\r\nshall believe also that the fiddler is his fiddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--HOMEWARD BOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nCome: I suppose you consider yourself quite a good sailor by now?\r\n\r\nOh, yes.  I have never been ill yet, though it has been quite rough again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\nWhat you call rough, little man.  But as you are grown such a very good\r\nsailor, and also as the sea is all but smooth, I think we will have a\r\nsail in the yacht to-day, and that a tolerably long one.\r\n\r\nOh, how delightful! but I thought we were going home; and the things are\r\nall packed up.\r\n\r\nAnd why should we not go homewards in the yacht, things and all?\r\n\r\nWhat, all the way to England?\r\n\r\nNo, not so far as that; but these kind people, when they came into the\r\nharbour last night, offered to take us up the coast to a town, where we\r\nwill sleep, and start comfortably home to-morrow morning.  So now you\r\nwill have a chance of seeing something of the great sea outside, and of\r\nseeing, perhaps, the whale himself.\r\n\r\nI hope we shall see the whale.  The men say he has been outside the\r\nharbour every day this week after the fish.\r\n\r\nVery good.  Now do you keep quiet, and out of the way, while we are\r\ngetting ready to go on board; and take a last look at this pretty place,\r\nand all its dear kind people.\r\n\r\nAnd the dear kind dogs too, and the cat and the kittens.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNow, come along, and bundle into the boat, if you have done bidding every\r\none good-bye; and take care you don't slip down in the ice-groovings, as\r\nyou did the other day.  There, we are off at last.\r\n\r\nOh, look at them all on the rock watching us and waving their\r\nhandkerchiefs; and Harper and Paddy too, and little Jimsy and Isy, with\r\ntheir fat bare feet, and their arms round the dogs' necks.  I am so sorry\r\nto leave them all.\r\n\r\nNot sorry to go home?\r\n\r\nNo, but--They have been so kind; and the dogs were so kind.  I am sure\r\nthey knew we were going, and were sorry too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they were.  They knew we were going away, at all events.  They\r\nknow what bringing out boxes and luggage means well enough.\r\n\r\nSam knew, I am sure; but he did not care for us.  He was only uneasy\r\nbecause he thought Harper was going, and he should lose his shooting; and\r\nas soon as he saw Harper was not getting into the boat, he sat down and\r\nscratched himself, quite happy.  But do dogs think?\r\n\r\nOf course they do, only they do not think in words, as we do.\r\n\r\nBut how can they think without words?\r\n\r\nThat is very difficult for you and me to imagine, because we always think\r\nin words.  They must think in pictures, I suppose, by remembering things\r\nwhich have happened to them.  You and I do that in our dreams.  I suspect\r\nthat savages, who have very few words to express their thoughts with,\r\nthink in pictures, like their own dogs.  But that is a long story.  We\r\nmust see about getting on board now, and under way.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWell, and what have you been doing?\r\n\r\nOh, I looked all over the yacht, at the ropes and curious things; and\r\nthen I looked at the mountains, till I was tired; and then I heard you\r\nand some gentleman talking about the land sinking, and I listened.  There\r\nwas no harm in that?\r\n\r\nNone at all.  But what did you hear him say?\r\n\r\nThat the land must be sinking here, because there were peat-bogs\r\neverywhere below high-water mark.  Is that true?\r\n\r\nQuite true; and that peat would never have been formed where the salt\r\nwater could get at it, as it does now every tide.\r\n\r\nBut what was it he said about that cliff over there?\r\n\r\nHe said that cliff on our right, a hundred feet high, was plainly once\r\njoined on to that low island on our left.\r\n\r\nWhat, that long bank of stones, with a house on it?\r\n\r\nThat is no house.  That is a square lump of mud, the last remaining bit\r\nof earth which was once the moraine of a glacier.  Every year it crumbles\r\ninto the sea more and more; and in a few years it will be all gone, and\r\nnothing left but the great round boulder-stones which the ice brought\r\ndown from the glaciers behind us.\r\n\r\nBut how does he know that it was once joined to the cliff?\r\n\r\nBecause that cliff, and the down behind it, where the cows are fed, is\r\nmade up, like the island, of nothing but loose earth and stones; and that\r\nis why it is bright and green beside the gray rocks and brown heather of\r\nthe moors at its foot.  He knows that it must be an old glacier moraine;\r\nand he has reason to think that moraine once stretched right across the\r\nbay to the low island, and perhaps on to the other shore, and was eaten\r\nout by the sea as the land sank down.\r\n\r\nBut how does he know that the land sank?\r\n\r\nOf that, he says, he is quite certain; and this is what he says.--Suppose\r\nthere was a glacier here, where we are sailing now: it would end in an\r\nice cliff, such as you have seen a picture of in Captain Cook's Voyages,\r\nof which you are so fond.  You recollect the pictures of Christmas Sound\r\nand Possession Bay?\r\n\r\nOh yes, and pictures of Greenland and Spitzbergen too, with glaciers in\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThen icebergs would break off from that cliff, and carry all the dirt and\r\nstones out to sea, perhaps hundreds of miles away, instead of letting it\r\ndrop here in a heap; and what did fall in a heap here the sea would wash\r\ndown at once, and smooth it over the sea-bottom, and never let it pile up\r\nin a huge bank like that.  Do you understand?\r\n\r\nI think I do.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he says, that great moraine must have been built upon dry\r\nland, in the open air; and must have sunk since into the sea, which is\r\ngnawing at it day and night, and will some day eat it all up, as it would\r\neat up all the dry land in the world, if Madam How was not continually\r\nlifting up fresh land, to make up for what the sea has carried off.\r\n\r\nOh, look there! some one has caught a fish, and is hauling it up.  What a\r\nstrange creature!  It is not a mackerel, nor a gurnet, nor a pollock.\r\n\r\nHow do you know that?\r\n\r\nWhy, it is running along the top of the water like a snake; and they\r\nnever do that.  Here it comes.  It has got a long beak, like a snipe.  Oh,\r\nlet me see.\r\n\r\nSee if you like: but don't get in the way.  Remember you are but a little\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? a snake with a bird's head?\r\n\r\nNo: a snake has no fins; and look at its beak: it is full of little\r\nteeth, which no bird has.  But a very curious fellow he is, nevertheless:\r\nand his name is Gar-fish.  Some call him Green-bone, because his bones\r\nare green.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of fish is he?  He is like nothing I ever saw.\r\n\r\nI believe he is nearest to a pike, though his backbone is different from\r\na pike, and from all other known fishes.\r\n\r\nBut is he not very rare?\r\n\r\nOh no: he comes to Devonshire and Cornwall with the mackerel, as he has\r\ncome here; and in calm weather he will swim on the top of the water, and\r\nplay about, and catch flies, and stand bolt upright with his long nose in\r\nthe air; and when the fisher-boys throw him a stick, he will jump over it\r\nagain and again, and play with it in the most ridiculous way.\r\n\r\nAnd what will they do with him?\r\n\r\nCut him up for bait, I suppose, for he is not very good to eat.\r\n\r\nCertainly, he does smell very nasty.\r\n\r\nHave you only just found out that?  Sometimes when I have caught one, he\r\nhas made the boat smell so that I was glad to throw him overboard, and so\r\nhe saved his life by his nastiness.  But they will catch plenty of\r\nmackerel now; for where he is they are; and where they are, perhaps the\r\nwhale will be; for we are now well outside the harbour, and running\r\nacross the open bay; and lucky for you that there are no rollers coming\r\nin from the Atlantic, and spouting up those cliffs in columns of white\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Hoch!\"\r\n\r\nAh!  Who was that coughed just behind the ship?\r\n\r\nWho, indeed? look round and see.\r\n\r\nThere is nobody.  There could not be in the sea.\r\n\r\nLook--there, a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\nOh!  What is that turning over in the water, like a great black wheel?\r\nAnd a great tooth on it, and--oh! it is gone!\r\n\r\nNever mind.  It will soon show itself again.\r\n\r\nBut what was it?\r\n\r\nThe whale: one of them, at least; for the men say there are two different\r\nones about the bay.  That black wheel was part of his back, as he turned\r\ndown; and the tooth on it was his back-fin.\r\n\r\nBut the noise, like a giant's cough?\r\n\r\nRather like the blast of a locomotive just starting.  That was his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nWhat? as loud as that?\r\n\r\nWhy not?  He is a very big fellow, and has big lungs.\r\n\r\nHow big is he?\r\n\r\nI cannot say: perhaps thirty or forty feet long.  We shall be able to see\r\nbetter soon.  He will come up again, and very likely nearer us, where\r\nthose birds are.\r\n\r\nI don't want him to come any nearer.\r\n\r\nYou really need not be afraid.  He is quite harmless.\r\n\r\nBut he might run against the yacht.\r\n\r\nHe might: and so might a hundred things happen which never do.  But I\r\nnever heard of one of these whales running against a vessel; so I suppose\r\nhe has sense enough to know that the yacht is no concern of his, and to\r\nkeep out of its way.\r\n\r\nBut why does he make that tremendous noise only once, and then go under\r\nwater again?\r\n\r\nYou must remember that he is not a fish.  A fish takes the water in\r\nthrough his mouth continually, and it runs over his gills, and out behind\r\nthrough his gill-covers.  So the gills suck-up the air out of the water,\r\nand send it into the fish's blood, just as they do in the newt-larva.\r\n\r\nYes, I know.\r\n\r\nBut the whale breathes with lungs like you and me; and when he goes under\r\nwater he has to hold his breath, as you and I have.\r\n\r\nWhat a long time he can hold it.\r\n\r\nYes.  He is a wonderful diver.  Some whales, they say, will keep under\r\nfor an hour.  But while he is under, mind, the air in his lungs is\r\ngetting foul, and full of carbonic acid, just as it would in your lungs,\r\nif you held your breath.  So he is forced to come up at last: and then\r\nout of his blowers, which are on the top of his head, he blasts out all\r\nthe foul breath, and with it the water which has got into his mouth, in a\r\ncloud of spray.  Then he sucks in fresh air, as much as he wants, and\r\ndives again, as you saw him do just now.\r\n\r\nAnd what does he do under water?\r\n\r\nLook--and you will see.  Look at those birds.  We will sail up to them;\r\nfor Mr. Whale will probably rise among them soon.\r\n\r\nOh, what a screaming and what a fighting!  How many sorts there are!  What\r\nare those beautiful little ones, like great white swallows, with crested\r\nheads and forked tails, who hover, and then dip down and pick up\r\nsomething?\r\n\r\nTerns--sea-swallows.  And there are gulls in hundreds, you see, large and\r\nsmall, gray-backed and black-backed; and over them all two or three great\r\ngannets swooping round and round.\r\n\r\nOh! one has fallen into the sea!\r\n\r\nYes, with a splash just like a cannon ball.  And here he comes up again,\r\nwith a fish in his beak.  If he had fallen on your head, with that beak\r\nof his, he would have split it open.  I have heard of men catching\r\ngannets by tying a fish on a board, and letting it float; and when the\r\ngannet strikes at it he drives his bill into the board, and cannot get it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut is not that cruel?\r\n\r\nI think so.  Gannets are of no use, for eating, or anything else.\r\n\r\nWhat a noise!  It is quite deafening.  And what are those black birds\r\nabout, who croak like crows, or parrots?\r\n\r\nLook at them.  Some have broad bills, with a white stripe on it, and cry\r\nsomething like the moor-hens at home.  Those are razor-bills.\r\n\r\nAnd what are those who say \"marrock,\" something like a parrot?\r\n\r\nThe ones with thin bills? they are guillemots, \"murres\" as we call them\r\nin Devon: but in some places they call them \"marrocks,\" from what they\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nAnd each has a little baby bird swimming behind it.  Oh! there: the\r\nmother has cocked up her tail and dived, and the little one is swimming\r\nabout looking for her!  How it cries!  It is afraid of the yacht.\r\n\r\nAnd there she comes up again, and cries \"marrock\" to call it.\r\n\r\nLook at it swimming up to her, and cuddling to her, quite happy.\r\n\r\nQuite happy.  And do you not think that any one who took a gun and shot\r\neither that mother or that child would be both cowardly and cruel?\r\n\r\nBut they might eat them.\r\n\r\nThese sea-birds are not good to eat.  They taste too strong of fish-oil.\r\nThey are of no use at all, except that the gulls' and terns' feathers are\r\nput into girls' hats.\r\n\r\nWell they might find plenty of other things to put in their hats.\r\n\r\nSo I think.  Yes: it would be very cruel, very cruel indeed, to do what\r\nsome do, shoot at these poor things, and leave them floating about\r\nwounded till they die.  But I suppose, if one gave them one's mind about\r\nsuch doings, and threatened to put the new Sea Fowl Act in force against\r\nthem, and fine them, and show them up in the newspapers, they would say\r\nthey meant no harm, and had never thought about its being cruel.\r\n\r\nThen they ought to think.\r\n\r\nThey ought; and so ought you.  Half the cruelty in the world, like half\r\nthe misery, comes simply from people's not thinking; and boys are often\r\nvery cruel from mere thoughtlessness.  So when you are tempted to rob\r\nbirds' nests, or to set the dogs on a moorhen, or pelt wrens in the\r\nhedge, think; and say--How should I like that to be done to me?\r\n\r\nI know: but what are all the birds doing?\r\n\r\nLook at the water, how it sparkles.  It is alive with tiny fish, \"fry,\"\r\n\"brett\" as we call them in the West, which the mackerel are driving up to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nPoor little things!  How hard on them!  The big fish at them from below,\r\nand the birds at them from above.  And what is that?  Thousands of fish\r\nleaping out of the water, scrambling over each other's backs.  What a\r\ncurious soft rushing roaring noise they make!\r\n\r\nAha!  The eaters are going to be eaten in turn.  Those are the mackerel\r\nthemselves; and I suspect they see Mr. Whale, and are scrambling out of\r\nthe way as fast as they can, lest he should swallow them down, a dozen at\r\na time.  Look out sharp for him now.\r\n\r\nI hope he will not come very near.\r\n\r\nNo.  The fish are going from us and past us.  If he comes up, he will\r\ncome up astern of us, so look back.  There he is!\r\n\r\nThat?  I thought it was a boat.\r\n\r\nYes.  He does look very like a boat upside down.  But that is only his\r\nhead and shoulders.  He will blow next.\r\n\r\n\"Hoch!\"\r\n\r\nOh!  What a jet of spray, like the Geysers!  And the sun made a rainbow\r\non the top of it.  He is quite still now.\r\n\r\nYes; he is taking a long breath or two.  You need not hold my hand so\r\ntight.  His head is from us; and when he goes down he will go right away.\r\n\r\nOh, he is turning head over heels!  There is his back fin again.  And--Ah!\r\nwas that not a slap!  How the water boiled and foamed; and what a tail he\r\nhad!  And how the mackerel flew out of the water!\r\n\r\nYes.  You are a lucky boy to have seen that.  I have not seen one of\r\nthose gentlemen show his \"flukes,\" as they call them, since I was a boy\r\non the Cornish coast.\r\n\r\nWhere is he gone?\r\n\r\nHunting mackerel, away out at sea.  But did you notice something odd\r\nabout his tail, as you call it--though it is really none?\r\n\r\nIt looked as if it was set on flat, and not upright, like a fish's.  But\r\nwhy is it not a tail?\r\n\r\nJust because it is set on flat, not upright: and learned men will tell\r\nyou that those two flukes are the \"rudiments\"--that is, either the\r\nbeginning, or more likely the last remains--of two hind feet.  But that\r\nbelongs to the second volume of Madam How's Book of Kind; and you have\r\nnot yet learned any of the first volume, you know, except about a few\r\nbutterflies.  Look here!  Here are more whales coming.  Don't be\r\nfrightened.  They are only little ones, mackerel-hunting, like the big\r\none.\r\n\r\nWhat pretty smooth things, turning head over heels, and saying, \"Hush,\r\nHush!\"\r\n\r\nThey don't really turn clean over; and that \"Hush\" is their way of\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nAre they the young ones of that great monster?\r\n\r\nNo; they are porpoises.  That big one is, I believe, a bottle-nose.  But\r\nif you want to know about the kinds of whales, you must ask Dr. Flower at\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons, and not me: and he will tell you wonderful\r\nthings about them.--How some of them have mouths full of strong teeth,\r\nlike these porpoises; and others, like the great sperm whale in the South\r\nSea, have huge teeth in their lower jaws, and in the upper only holes\r\ninto which those teeth fit; others like the bottle-nose, only two teeth\r\nor so in the lower jaw; and others, like the narwhal, two straight tusks\r\nin the upper jaw, only one of which grows, and is what you call a\r\nnarwhal's horn.\r\n\r\nOh yes.  I know of a walking-stick made of one.\r\n\r\nAnd strangest of all, how the right-whales have a few little teeth when\r\nthey are born, which never come through the gums; but, instead, they grow\r\nall along their gums, an enormous curtain of clotted hair, which serves\r\nas a net to keep in the tiny sea-animals on which they feed, and let the\r\nwater strain out.\r\n\r\nYou mean whalebone?  Is whalebone hair?\r\n\r\nSo it seems.  And so is a rhinoceros's horn.  A rhinoceros used to be\r\nhairy all over in old times: but now he carries all his hair on the end\r\nof his nose, except a few bristles on his tail.  And the right-whale, not\r\nto be done in oddity, carries all his on his gums.\r\n\r\nBut have no whales any hair?\r\n\r\nNo real whales: but the Manati, which is very nearly a whale, has long\r\nbristly hair left.  Don't you remember M.'s letter about the one he saw\r\nat Rio Janeiro?\r\n\r\nThis is all very funny: but what is the use of knowing so much about\r\nthings' teeth and hair?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of learning Latin and Greek, and a dozen things more\r\nwhich you have to learn?  You don't know yet: but wiser people than you\r\ntell you that they will be of use some day.  And I can tell you, that if\r\nyou would only study that gar-fish long enough, and compare him with\r\nanother fish something like him, who has a long beak to his lower jaw,\r\nand none to his upper--and how he eats I cannot guess,--and both of them\r\nagain with certain fishes like them, which M. Agassiz has found lately,\r\nnot in the sea, but in the river Amazon; and then think carefully enough\r\nover their bones and teeth, and their history from the time they are\r\nhatched--why, you would find out, I believe, a story about the river\r\nAmazon itself, more wonderful than all the fairy tales you ever read.\r\n\r\nNow there is luncheon ready.  Come down below, and don't tumble down the\r\ncompanion-stairs; and by the time you have eaten your dinner we shall be\r\nvery near the shore.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSo?  Here is my little man on deck, after a good night's rest.  And he\r\nhas not been the least sick, I hear.\r\n\r\nNot a bit: but the cabin was so stuffy and hot, I asked leave to come on\r\ndeck.  What a huge steamer!  But I do not like it as well as the yacht.\r\nIt smells of oil and steam, and--\r\n\r\nAnd pigs and bullocks too, I am sorry to say.  Don't go forward above\r\nthem, but stay here with me, and look round.\r\n\r\nWhere are we now?  What are those high hills, far away to the left, above\r\nthe lowlands and woods?\r\n\r\nThose are the shore of the Old World--the Welsh mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd in front of us I can see nothing but flat land.  Where is that?\r\n\r\nThat is the mouth of the Severn and Avon; where we shall be in half an\r\nhour more.\r\n\r\nAnd there, on the right, over the low hills, I can see higher ones, blue\r\nand hazy.\r\n\r\nThose are an island of the Old World, called now the Mendip Hills; and we\r\nare steaming along the great strait between the Mendips and the Welsh\r\nmountains, which once was coral reef, and is now the Severn sea; and by\r\nthe time you have eaten your breakfast we shall steam in through a crack\r\nin that coral-reef; and you will see what you missed seeing when you went\r\nto Ireland, because you went on board at night.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nOh!  Where have we got to now?  Where is the wide Severn Sea?\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles beyond us; and here we are in narrow little Avon.\r\n\r\nNarrow indeed.  I wonder that the steamer does not run against those\r\nrocks.  But how beautiful they are, and how the trees hang down over the\r\nwater, and are all reflected in it!\r\n\r\nYes.  The gorge of the Avon is always lovely.  I saw it first when I was\r\na little boy like you; and I have seen it many a time since, in sunshine\r\nand in storm, and thought it more lovely every time.  Look! there is\r\nsomething curious.\r\n\r\nWhat?  Those great rusty rings fixed into the rock?\r\n\r\nYes.  Those may be as old, for aught I know, as Queen Elizabeth's or\r\nJames's reign.\r\n\r\nBut why were they put there?\r\n\r\nFor ships to hold on by, if they lost the tide.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nIt is high tide now.  That is why the water is almost up to the branches\r\nof the trees.  But when the tide turns, it will all rush out in a torrent\r\nwhich would sweep ships out to sea again, if they had not steam, as we\r\nhave, to help them up against the stream.  So sailing ships, in old\r\ntimes, fastened themselves to those rings, and rode against the stream\r\ntill the tide turned, and carried them up to Bristol.\r\n\r\nBut what is the tide?  And why does it go up and down?  And why does it\r\nalter with the moon, as I heard you all saying so often in Ireland?\r\n\r\nThat is a long story, which I must tell you something about some other\r\ntime.  Now I want you to look at something else: and that is, the rocks\r\nthemselves, in which the rings are.  They are very curious in my eyes,\r\nand very valuable; for they taught me a lesson in geology when I was\r\nquite a boy: and I want them to teach it to you now.\r\n\r\nWhat is there curious in them?\r\n\r\nThis.  You will soon see for yourself, even from the steamer's deck, that\r\nthey are not the same rock as the high limestone hills above.  They are\r\nmade up of red sand and pebbles; and they are a whole world younger,\r\nindeed some say two worlds younger, than the limestone hills above, and\r\nlie upon the top of the limestone.  Now you may see what I meant when I\r\nsaid that the newer rocks, though they lie on the top of the older, were\r\noften lower down than they are.\r\n\r\nBut how do you know that they lie on the limestone?\r\n\r\nLook into that corner of the river, as we turn round, and you will see\r\nwith your own eyes.  There are the sandstones, lying flat on the turned-\r\nup edges of another rock.\r\n\r\nYes; I see.  The layers of it are almost upright.\r\n\r\nThen that upright rock underneath is part of the great limestone hill\r\nabove.  So the hill must have been raised out of the sea, ages ago, and\r\neaten back by the waves; and then the sand and pebbles made a beach at\r\nits foot, and hardened into stone; and there it is.  And when you get\r\nthrough the limestone hills to Bristol, you will see more of these same\r\nred sandstone rocks, spread about at the foot of the limestone-hills, on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nBut why is the sandstone two worlds newer than the limestone?\r\n\r\nBecause between that sandstone and that limestone come hundreds of feet\r\nof rock, which carry in them all the coal in England.  Don't you remember\r\nthat I told you that once before?\r\n\r\nOh yes.  But I see no coal between them there.\r\n\r\nNo.  But there is plenty of coal between them over in Wales; and plenty\r\ntoo between them on the other side of Bristol.  What you are looking at\r\nthere is just the lip of a great coal-box, where the bottom and the lid\r\njoin.  The bottom is the mountain limestone; and the lid is the new red\r\nsandstone, or Trias, as they call it now: but the coal you cannot see.  It\r\nis stowed inside the box, miles away from here.  But now, look at the\r\ncliffs and the downs, which (they tell me) are just like the downs in the\r\nHoly Land; and the woods and villas, high over your head.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that in the air?  A bridge?\r\n\r\nYes--that is the famous Suspension Bridge--and a beautiful work of art it\r\nis.  Ay, stare at it, and wonder at it, little man, of course.\r\n\r\nBut is it not wonderful?\r\n\r\nYes: it was a clever trick to get those chains across the gulf, high up\r\nin the air: but not so clever a trick as to make a single stone of which\r\nthose piers are built, or a single flower or leaf in those woods.  The\r\nmore you see of Madam How's masonry and carpentry, the clumsier man's\r\nwork will look to you.  But now we must get ready to give up our tickets,\r\nand go ashore, and settle ourselves in the train; and then we shall have\r\nplenty to see as we run home; more curious, to my mind, than any\r\nsuspension bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd you promised to show me all the different rocks and soils as we went\r\nhome, because it was so dark when we came from Reading.\r\n\r\nVery good.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNow we are settled in the train.  And what do you want to know first?\r\n\r\nMore about the new rocks being lower than the old ones, though they lie\r\non the top of them.\r\n\r\nWell, look here, at this sketch.\r\n\r\nA boy piling up slates?  What has that to do with it?\r\n\r\nI saw you in Ireland piling slates against a rock just in this way.  And\r\nI thought to myself--\"That is something like Madam How's work.\"\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nWhy, see.  The old rock stands for the mountains of the Old World, like\r\nthe Welsh mountains, or the Mendip Hills.  The slates stand for the new\r\nrocks, which have been piled up against these, one over the other.  But,\r\nyou see, each slate is lower than the one before it, and slopes more;\r\ntill the last slate which you are putting on is the lowest of all, though\r\nit overlies all.\r\n\r\nI see now.  I see now.\r\n\r\nThen look at the sketch of the rocks between this and home.  It is only a\r\nrough sketch, of course: but it will make you understand something more\r\nabout the matter.  Now.  You see, the lump marked A.  With twisted lines\r\nin it.  That stands for the Mendip Hills to the west, which are made of\r\nold red sandstone, very much the same rock (to speak roughly) as the\r\nKerry mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd why are the lines in it twisted?\r\n\r\nTo show that the strata, the layers in it, are twisted, and set up at\r\nquite different angles from the limestone.\r\n\r\nBut how was that done?\r\n\r\nBy old earthquakes and changes which happened in old worlds, ages on ages\r\nsince.  Then the edges of the old red sandstone were eaten away by the\r\nsea--and some think by ice too, in some earlier age of ice; and then the\r\nlimestone coral reef was laid down on them, \"unconformably,\" as\r\ngeologists say--just as you saw the new red sandstone laid down on the\r\nedges of the limestone; and so one world is built up on the edge of\r\nanother world, out of its scraps and ruins.\r\n\r\nThen do you see B.  With a notch in it?  That means these limestone hills\r\non the shoulder of the Mendips; and that notch is the gorge of the Avon\r\nwhich we have steamed through.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that black above it?\r\n\r\nThat is the coal, a few miles off, marked C.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this D, which comes next?\r\n\r\nThat is what we are on now.  New red sandstone, lying unconformably on\r\nthe coal.  I showed it you in the bed of the river, as we came along in\r\nthe cab.  We are here in a sort of amphitheatre, or half a one, with the\r\nlimestone hills around us, and the new red sandstone plastered on, as it\r\nwere, round the bottom of it inside.\r\n\r\nBut what is this high bit with E against it?\r\n\r\nThose are the high hills round Bath, which we shall run through soon.\r\nThey are newer than the soil here; and they are (for an exception) higher\r\ntoo; for they are so much harder than the soil here, that the sea has not\r\neaten them away, as it has all the lowlands from Bristol right into the\r\nSomersetshire flats.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThere.  We are off at last, and going to run home to Reading, through one\r\nof the loveliest lines (as I think) of old England.  And between the\r\nintervals of eating fruit, we will geologize on the way home, with this\r\nlittle bit of paper to show us where we are.\r\n\r\nWhat pretty rocks!\r\n\r\nYes.  They are a boss of the coal measures, I believe, shoved up with the\r\nlias, the lias lying round them.  But I warn you I may not be quite\r\nright: because I never looked at a geological map of this part of the\r\nline, and have learnt what I know, just as I want you to learn simply by\r\nlooking out of the carriage window.\r\n\r\nLook.  Here is lias rock in the side of the cutting; layers of hard blue\r\nlimestone, and then layers of blue mud between them, in which, if you\r\ncould stop to look, you would find fossils in plenty; and along that lias\r\nwe shall run to Bath, and then all the rocks will change.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNow, here we are at Bath; and here are the handsome fruit-women, waiting\r\nfor you to buy.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, what strawberries and cherries!\r\n\r\nYes.  All this valley is very rich, and very sheltered too, and very\r\nwarm; for the soft south-western air sweeps up it from the Bristol\r\nChannel; so the slopes are covered with fruit-orchards, as you will see\r\nas you get out of the station.\r\n\r\nWhy, we are above the tops of the houses.\r\n\r\nYes.  We have been rising ever since we left Bristol; and you will soon\r\nsee why.  Now we have laid in as much fruit as is safe for you, and away\r\nwe go.\r\n\r\nOh, what high hills over the town!  And what beautiful stone houses!  Even\r\nthe cottages are built of stone.\r\n\r\nAll that stone comes out of those high hills, into which we are going\r\nnow.  It is called Bath-stone freestone, or oolite; and it lies on the\r\ntop of the lias, which we have just left.  Here it is marked F.\r\n\r\nWhat steep hills, and cliffs too, and with quarries in them!  What can\r\nhave made them so steep?  And what can have made this little narrow\r\nvalley?\r\n\r\nMadam How's rain-spade from above, I suppose, and perhaps the sea gnawing\r\nat their feet below.  Those freestone hills once stretched high over our\r\nheads, and far away, I suppose, to the westward.  Now they are all gnawed\r\nout into cliffs,--indeed gnawed clean through in the bottom of the\r\nvalley, where the famous hot springs break out in which people bathe.\r\n\r\nIs that why the place is called Bath?\r\n\r\nOf course.  But the Old Romans called the place Aquae Solis--the waters\r\nof the sun; and curious old Roman remains are found here, which we have\r\nnot time to stop and see.\r\n\r\nNow look out at the pretty clear limestone stream running to meet us\r\nbelow, and the great limestone hills closing over us above.  How do you\r\nthink we shall get out from among them?\r\n\r\nShall we go over their tops?\r\n\r\nNo.  That would be too steep a climb, for even such a great engine as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThen there is a crack which we can get through?\r\n\r\nLook and see.\r\n\r\nWhy, we are coming to a regular wall of hill, and--\r\n\r\nAnd going right through it in the dark.  We are in the Box Tunnel.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThere is the light again: and now I suppose you will find your tongue.\r\n\r\nHow long it seemed before we came out!\r\n\r\nYes, because you were waiting and watching, with nothing to look at: but\r\nthe tunnel is only a mile and a quarter long after all, I believe.  If\r\nyou had been looking at fields and hedgerows all the while, you would\r\nhave thought no time at all had passed.\r\n\r\nWhat curious sandy rocks on each side of the cutting, in lines and\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\nThose are the freestone still: and full of fossils they are.  But do you\r\nsee that they dip away from us?  Remember that.  All the rocks are\r\nsloping eastward, the way we are going; and each new rock or soil we come\r\nto lies on the top of the one before it.  Now we shall run down hill for\r\nmany a mile, down the back of the oolites, past pretty Chippenham, and\r\nWootton-Bassett, towards Swindon spire.  Look at the country, child; and\r\nthank God for this fair English land, in which your lot is cast.\r\n\r\nWhat beautiful green fields; and such huge elm trees; and orchards; and\r\nflowers in the cottage gardens!\r\n\r\nAy, and what crops, too: what wheat and beans, turnips and mangold.  All\r\nthis land is very rich and easily worked; and hereabouts is some of the\r\nbest farming in England.  The Agricultural College at Cirencester, of\r\nwhich you have so often heard, lies thereaway, a few miles to our left;\r\nand there lads go to learn to farm as no men in the world, save English\r\nand Scotch, know how to farm.\r\n\r\nBut what rock are we on now?\r\n\r\nOn rock that is much softer than that on the other side of the oolite\r\nhills: much softer, because it is much newer.  We have got off the\r\noolites on to what is called the Oxford clay; and then, I believe, on to\r\nthe Coral rag, and on that again lies what we are coming to now.  Do you\r\nsee the red sand in that field?\r\n\r\nThen that is the lowest layer of a fresh world, so to speak; a world\r\nstill younger than the oolites--the chalk world.\r\n\r\nBut that is not chalk, or anything like it.\r\n\r\nNo, that is what is called Greensand.\r\n\r\nBut it is not green, it is red.\r\n\r\nI know: but years ago it got the name from one green vein in it, in which\r\nthe \"Coprolites,\" as you learnt to call them at Cambridge, are found; and\r\nthat, and a little layer of blue clay, called gault, between the upper\r\nGreensand and lower Greensand, runs along everywhere at the foot of the\r\nchalk hills.\r\n\r\nI see the hills now.  Are they chalk?\r\n\r\nYes, chalk they are: so we may begin to feel near home now.  See how they\r\nrange away to the south toward Devizes, and Westbury, and Warminster, a\r\ngoodly land and large.  At their feet, everywhere, run the rich pastures\r\non which the Wiltshire cheese is made; and here and there, as at\r\nWestbury, there is good iron-ore in the greensand, which is being smelted\r\nnow, as it used to be in the Weald of Surrey and Kent ages since.  I must\r\ntell you about that some other time.\r\n\r\nBut are there Coprolites here?\r\n\r\nI believe there are: I know there are some at Swindon; and I do not see\r\nwhy they should not be found, here and there, all the way along the foot\r\nof the downs, from here to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nBut do these downs go to Cambridge?\r\n\r\nOf course they do.  We are now in the great valley which runs right\r\nacross England from south-west to north-east, from Axminster in\r\nDevonshire to Hunstanton in Norfolk, with the chalk always on your right\r\nhand, and the oolite hills on your left, till it ends by sinking into the\r\nsea, among the fens of Lincolnshire and Norfolk.\r\n\r\nBut what made that great valley?\r\n\r\nI am not learned enough to tell.  Only this I think we can say--that once\r\non a time these chalk downs on our right reached high over our heads\r\nhere, and far to the north; and that Madam How pared them away, whether\r\nby icebergs, or by sea-waves, or merely by rain, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nWell, those downs do look very like sea-cliffs.\r\n\r\nSo they do, very like an old shore-line.  Be that as it may, after the\r\nchalk was eaten away, Madam How began digging into the soils below the\r\nchalk, on which we are now; and because they were mostly soft clays, she\r\ncut them out very easily, till she came down, or nearly down, to the\r\nharder freestone rocks which run along on our left hand, miles away; and\r\nso she scooped out this great vale, which we call here the Vale of White\r\nHorse; and further on, the Vale of Aylesbury; and then the Bedford Level;\r\nand then the dear ugly old Fens.\r\n\r\nIs this the Vale of White Horse?  Oh, I know about it; I have read _The\r\nScouring of the White Horse_.\r\n\r\nOf course you have; and when you are older you will read a jollier book\r\nstill,--_Tom Brown's School Days_--and when we have passed Swindon, we\r\nshall see some of the very places described in it, close on our right.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThere is the White Horse Hill.\r\n\r\nThe White Horse Hill?  But where is the horse?  I can see a bit of him:\r\nbut he does not look like a horse from here, or indeed from any other\r\nplace; he is a very old horse indeed, and a thousand years of wind and\r\nrain have spoilt his anatomy a good deal on the top of that wild down.\r\n\r\nAnd is that really where Alfred fought the Danes?\r\n\r\nAs certainly, boy, I believe, as that Waterloo is where the Duke fought\r\nNapoleon.  Yes: you may well stare at it with all your eyes, the noble\r\ndown.  It is one of the most sacred spots on English soil.\r\n\r\nAh, it is gone now.  The train runs so fast.\r\n\r\nSo it does; too fast to let you look long at one thing: but in return, it\r\nlets you see so many more things in a given time than the slow old\r\ncoaches and posters did.--Well? what is it?\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask you a question, but you won't listen to me.\r\n\r\nWon't I?  I suppose I was dreaming with my eyes open.  You see, I have\r\nbeen so often along this line--and through this country, too, long before\r\nthe line was made--that I cannot pass it without its seeming full of\r\nmemories--perhaps of ghosts.\r\n\r\nOf real ghosts?\r\n\r\nAs real ghosts, I suspect, as any one on earth ever saw; faces and scenes\r\nwhich have printed themselves so deeply on one's brain, that when one\r\npasses the same place, long years after, they start up again, out of\r\nfields and roadsides, as if they were alive once more, and need sound\r\nsense to send them back again into their place as things which are past\r\nfor ever, for good and ill.  But what did you want to know?\r\n\r\nWhy, I am so tired of looking out of the window.  It is all the same:\r\nfields and hedges, hedges and fields; and I want to talk.\r\n\r\nFields and hedges, hedges and fields?  Peace and plenty, plenty and\r\npeace.  However, it may seem dull, now that the grass is cut; but you\r\nwould not have said so two months ago, when the fields were all golden-\r\ngreen with buttercups, and the whitethorn hedges like crested waves of\r\nsnow.  I should like to take a foreigner down the Vale of Berkshire in\r\nthe end of May, and ask him what he thought of old England.  But what\r\nshall we talk about?\r\n\r\nI want to know about Coprolites, if they dig them here, as they do at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nI don't think they do.  But I suspect they will some day.\r\n\r\nBut why do people dig them?\r\n\r\nBecause they are rational men, and want manure for their fields.\r\n\r\nBut what are Coprolites?\r\n\r\nWell, they were called Coprolites at first because some folk fancied they\r\nwere the leavings of fossil animals, such as you may really find in the\r\nlias at Lynn in Dorsetshire.  But they are not that; and all we can say\r\nis, that a long time ago, before the chalk began to be made, there was a\r\nshallow sea in England, the shore of which was so covered with dead\r\nanimals, that the bone-earth (the phosphate of lime) out of them crusted\r\nitself round every bone, and shell, and dead sea-beast on the shore, and\r\ngot covered up with fresh sand, and buried for ages as a mine of wealth.\r\n\r\nBut how many millions of dead creatures, there must have been!  What\r\nkilled them?\r\n\r\nWe do not know.  No more do we know how it comes to pass that this thin\r\nband (often only a few inches thick) of dead creatures should stretch all\r\nthe way from Dorsetshire to Norfolk, and, I believe, up through\r\nLincolnshire.  And what is stranger still, this same bone-earth bed crops\r\nout on the south side of the chalk at Farnham, and stretches along the\r\nfoot of those downs, right into Kent, making the richest hop lands in\r\nEngland, through Surrey, and away to Tunbridge.  So that it seems as if\r\nthe bed lay under the chalk everywhere, if once we could get down to it.\r\n\r\nBut how does it make the hop lands so rich?\r\n\r\nBecause hops, like tobacco and vines, take more phosphorus out of the\r\nsoil than any other plants which we grow in England; and it is the\r\nwashings of this bone-earth bed which make the lower lands in Farnham so\r\nunusually rich, that in some of them--the garden, for instance, under the\r\nBishop's castle--have grown hops without resting, I believe, for three\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nBut who found out all this about the Coprolites?\r\n\r\nAh--I will tell you; and show you how scientific men, whom ignorant\r\npeople sometimes laugh at as dreamers, and mere pickers up of useless\r\nweeds and old stones, may do real service to their country and their\r\ncountrymen, as I hope you will some day.\r\n\r\nThere was a clergyman named Henslow, now with God, honoured by all\r\nscientific men, a kind friend and teacher of mine, loved by every little\r\nchild in his parish.  His calling was botany: but he knew something of\r\ngeology.  And some of these Coprolites were brought him as curiosities,\r\nbecause they had fossils in them.  But he (so the tale goes) had the wit\r\nto see that they were not, like other fossils, carbonate of lime, but\r\nphosphate of lime--bone earth.  Whereon he told the neighbouring farmers\r\nthat they had a mine of wealth opened to them, if they would but use them\r\nfor manure.  And after a while he was listened to.  Then others began to\r\nfind them in the Eastern counties; and then another man, as learned and\r\nwise as he was good and noble--John Paine of Farnham, also now with\r\nGod--found them on his own estate, and made much use and much money of\r\nthem: and now tens of thousands of pounds' worth of valuable manure are\r\nmade out of them every year, in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, by\r\ndigging them out of land which was till lately only used for common\r\nfarmers' crops.\r\n\r\nBut how do they turn Coprolites into manure?  I used to see them in the\r\nrailway trucks at Cambridge, and they were all like what I have at\r\nhome--hard pebbles.\r\n\r\nThey grind them first in a mill.  Then they mix them with sulphuric acid\r\nand water, and that melts them down, and parts them into two things.  One\r\nis sulphate of lime (gypsum, as it is commonly called), and which will\r\nnot dissolve in water, and is of little use.  But the other is what is\r\ncalled superphosphate of lime, which will dissolve in water; so that the\r\nroots of the plants can suck it up: and that is one of the richest of\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\nOh, I know: you put superphosphate on the grass last year.\r\n\r\nYes.  But not that kind; a better one still.  The superphosphate from the\r\nCopiolites is good; but the superphosphate from fresh bones is better\r\nstill, and therefore dearer, because it has in it the fibrine of the\r\nbones, which is full of nitrogen, like gristle or meat; and all that has\r\nbeen washed out of the bone-earth bed ages and ages ago.  But you must\r\nlearn some chemistry to understand that.\r\n\r\nI should like to be a scientific man, if one can find out such really\r\nuseful things by science.\r\n\r\nChild, there is no saying what you might find out, or of what use you may\r\nbe to your fellow-men.  A man working at science, however dull and dirty\r\nhis work may seem at times, is like one of those \"chiffoniers,\" as they\r\ncall them in Paris--people who spend their lives in gathering rags and\r\nsifting refuse, but who may put their hands at any moment upon some\r\nprecious jewel.  And not only may you be able to help your neighbours to\r\nfind out what will give them health and wealth: but you may, if you can\r\nonly get them to listen to you, save them from many a foolish experiment,\r\nwhich ends in losing money just for want of science.  I have heard of a\r\nman who, for want of science, was going to throw away great sums (I\r\nbelieve he, luckily for him, never could raise the money) in boring for\r\ncoal in our Bagshot sands at home.  The man thought that because there\r\nwas coal under the heather moors in the North, there must needs be coal\r\nhere likewise, when a geologist could have told him the contrary.  There\r\nwas another man at Hennequin's Lodge, near the Wellington College, who\r\nthought he would make the poor sands fertile by manuring them with whale\r\noil, of all things in the world.  So he not only lost all the cost of his\r\nwhale oil, but made the land utterly barren, as it is unto this day; and\r\nall for want of science.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew a manufacturer, too, who went to bore an Artesian well for\r\nwater, and hired a regular well-borer to do it.  But, meanwhile he was\r\nwise enough to ask a geologist of those parts how far he thought it was\r\ndown to the water.  The geologist made his calculations, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You will go through so many feet of Bagshot sand; and so many feet of\r\nLondon clay; and so many feet of the Thanet beds between them and the\r\nchalk: and then you will win water, at about 412 feet; but not, I think,\r\ntill then.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-sinker laughed at that, and said, \"He had no opinion of\r\ngeologists, and such-like.  He never found any clay in England but what\r\nhe could get through in 150 feet.\"\r\n\r\nSo he began to bore--150 feet, 200, 300: and then he began to look rather\r\nsilly; at last, at 405--only seven feet short of what the geologist had\r\nforetold--up came the water in a regular spout.  But, lo and behold, not\r\nexpecting to have to bore so deep, he had made his bore much too small;\r\nand the sand out of the Thanet beds \"blew up\" into the bore, and closed\r\nit.  The poor manufacturer spent hundreds of pounds more in trying to get\r\nthe sand out, but in vain; and he had at last to make a fresh and much\r\nlarger well by the side of the old one, bewailing the day when he\r\nlistened to the well-sinker and not to the geologist, and so threw away\r\nmore than a thousand pounds.  And there is an answer to what you asked on\r\nboard the yacht--What use was there in learning little matters of natural\r\nhistory and science, which seemed of no use at all?  And now, look out\r\nagain.  Do you see any change in the country?\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nWhy, there to the left.\r\n\r\nThere are high hills there now, as well as to the right.  What are they?\r\n\r\nChalk hills too.  The chalk is on both sides of us now.  These are the\r\nChilterns, all away to Ipsden and Nettlebed, and so on across Oxfordshire\r\nand Buckinghamshire, and into Hertfordshire; and on again to Royston and\r\nCambridge, while below them lies the Vale of Aylesbury; you can just see\r\nthe beginning of it on their left.  A pleasant land are those hills, and\r\nwealthy; full of noble houses buried in the deep beech-woods, which once\r\nwere a great forest, stretching in a ring round the north of London, full\r\nof deer and boar, and of wild bulls too, even as late as the twelfth\r\ncentury, according to the old legend of Thomas a Becket's father and the\r\nfair Saracen, which you have often heard.\r\n\r\nI know.  But how are you going to get through the chalk hills?  Is there\r\na tunnel as there is at Box and at Micheldever?\r\n\r\nNo.  Something much prettier than a tunnel and something which took a\r\ngreat many years longer in making.  We shall soon meet with a very\r\nremarkable and famous old gentleman, who is a great adept at digging, and\r\nat landscape gardening likewise; and he has dug out a path for himself\r\nthrough the chalk, which we shall take the liberty of using also.  And\r\nhis name, if you wish to know it, is Father Thames.\r\n\r\nI see him.  What a great river!\r\n\r\nYes.  Here he comes, gleaming and winding down from Oxford, over the\r\nlowlands, past Wallingford; but where he is going to it is not so easy to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAh, here is chalk in the cutting at last.  And what a high bridge.  And\r\nthe river far under our feet.  Why we are crossing him again!\r\n\r\nYes; he winds more sharply than a railroad can.  But is not this prettier\r\nthan a tunnel?\r\n\r\nOh, what hanging-woods, and churches; and such great houses, and pretty\r\ncottages and gardens--all in this narrow crack of a valley!\r\n\r\nAy.  Old Father Thames is a good landscape gardener, as I said.  There is\r\nBasildon--and Hurley--and Pangbourne, with its roaring lasher.  Father\r\nThames has had to work hard for many an age before he could cut this\r\ntrench right through the chalk, and drain the water out of the flat vale\r\nbehind us.  But I suspect the sea helped him somewhat, or perhaps a great\r\ndeal, just where we are now.\r\n\r\nThe sea?\r\n\r\nYes.  The sea was once--and that not so very long ago--right up here,\r\nbeyond Reading.  This is the uppermost end of the great Thames valley,\r\nwhich must have been an estuary--a tide flat, like the mouth of the\r\nSevern, with the sea eating along at the foot of all the hills.  And if\r\nthe land sunk only some fifty feet,--which is a very little indeed,\r\nchild, in this huge, ever-changing world,--then the tide would come up to\r\nReading again, and the greater part of London and the county of Middlesex\r\nbe drowned in salt water.\r\n\r\nHow dreadful that would be!\r\n\r\nDreadful indeed.  God grant that it may never happen.  More terrible\r\nchanges of land and water have happened, and are happening still in the\r\nworld: but none, I think, could happen which would destroy so much\r\ncivilisation and be such a loss to mankind, as that the Thames valley\r\nshould become again what it was, geologically speaking, only the other\r\nday, when these gravel banks, over which we are running to Reading, were\r\nbeing washed out of the chalk cliffs up above at every tide, and rolled\r\non a beach, as you have seen them rolling still at Ramsgate.\r\n\r\nNow here we are at Reading.  There is the carriage waiting, and away we\r\nare off home; and when we get home, and have seen everybody and\r\neverything, we will look over our section once more.\r\n\r\nBut remember, that when you ran through the chalk hills to Reading, you\r\npassed from the bottom of the chalk to the top of it, on to the Thames\r\ngravels, which lie there on the chalk, and on to the London clay, which\r\nlies on the chalk also, with the Thames gravels always over it.  So that,\r\nyou see, the newest layers, the London clay and the gravels, are lower in\r\nheight than the limestone cliffs at Bristol, and much lower than the old\r\nmountain ranges of Devonshire and Wales, though in geological order they\r\nare far higher; and there are whole worlds of strata, rocks and clays,\r\none on the other, between the Thames gravels and the Devonshire hills.\r\n\r\nBut how about our moors?  They are newer still, you said, than the London\r\nclay, because they lie upon it: and yet they are much higher than we are\r\nhere at Reading.\r\n\r\nVery well said: so they are, two or three hundred feet higher.  But our\r\npart of them was left behind, standing up in banks, while the valley of\r\nthe Thames was being cut out by the sea.  Once they spread all over where\r\nwe stand now, and away behind us beyond Newbury in Berkshire, and away in\r\nfront of us, all over where London now stands.\r\n\r\nHow can you tell that?\r\n\r\nBecause there are little caps--little patches--of them left on the tops\r\nof many hills to the north of London; just remnants which the sea, and\r\nthe Thames, and the rain have not eaten down.  Probably they once\r\nstretched right out to sea, sloping slowly under the waves, where the\r\nmouth of the Thames is now.  You know the sand-cliffs at Bournemouth?\r\n\r\nOf course.\r\n\r\nThen those are of the same age as the Bagshot sands, and lie on the\r\nLondon clay, and slope down off the New Forest into the sea, which eats\r\nthem up, as you know, year by year and day by day.  And here were once\r\nperhaps cliffs just like them, where London Bridge now stands.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThere, we are rumbling away home at last, over the dear old\r\nheather-moors.  How far we have travelled--in our fancy at least--since\r\nwe began to talk about all these things, upon the foggy November day, and\r\nfirst saw Madam How digging at the sand-banks with her water-spade.  How\r\nmany countries we have talked of; and what wonderful questions we have\r\ngot answered, which all grew out of the first question, How were the\r\nheather-moors made?  And yet we have not talked about a hundredth part of\r\nthe things about which these very heather-moors ought to set us thinking.\r\nBut so it is, child.  Those who wish honestly to learn the laws of Madam\r\nHow, which we call Nature, by looking honestly at what she does, which we\r\ncall Fact, have only to begin by looking at the very smallest thing,\r\npin's head or pebble, at their feet, and it may lead them--whither, they\r\ncannot tell.  To answer any one question, you find you must answer\r\nanother; and to answer that you must answer a third, and then a fourth;\r\nand so on for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nFor ever and ever?\r\n\r\nOf course.  If we thought and searched over the Universe--ay, I believe,\r\nonly over this one little planet called earth--for millions on millions\r\nof years, we should not get to the end of our searching.  The more we\r\nlearnt, the more we should find there was left to learn.  All things, we\r\nshould find, are constituted according to a Divine and Wonderful Order,\r\nwhich links each thing to every other thing; so that we cannot fully\r\ncomprehend any one thing without comprehending all things: and who can do\r\nthat, save He who made all things?  Therefore our true wisdom is never to\r\nfancy that we do comprehend: never to make systems and theories of the\r\nUniverse (as they are called) as if we had stood by and looked on when\r\ntime and space began to be; but to remember that those who say they\r\nunderstand, show, simply by so saying, that they understand nothing at\r\nall; that those who say they see, are sure to be blind; while those who\r\nconfess that they are blind, are sure some day to see.  All we can do is,\r\nto keep up the childlike heart, humble and teachable, though we grew as\r\nwise as Newton or as Humboldt; and to follow, as good Socrates bids us,\r\nReason whithersoever it leads us, sure that it will never lead us wrong,\r\nunless we have darkened it by hasty and conceited fancies of our own, and\r\nso have become like those foolish men of old, of whom it was said that\r\nthe very light within them was darkness.  But if we love and reverence\r\nand trust Fact and Nature, which are the will, not merely of Madam How,\r\nor even of Lady Why, but of Almighty God Himself, then we shall be really\r\nloving, and reverencing, and trusting God; and we shall have our reward\r\nby discovering continually fresh wonders and fresh benefits to man; and\r\nfind it as true of science, as it is of this life and of the life to\r\ncome--that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the\r\nheart of man to conceive, what God has prepared for those who love Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  I could not resist the temptation of quoting this splendid\r\ngeneralisation from Dr. Carpenter's Preliminary Report of the Dredging\r\nOperations of H.M.S. \"Lightening,\" 1868.  He attributes it, generously,\r\nto his colleague, Dr. Wyville Thomson.  Be it whose it may, it will mark\r\n(as will probably the whole Report when completed) a new era in\r\nBio-Geology.",
