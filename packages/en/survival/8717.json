Few persons probably have been able to watch and observe the\r\nhabits of the animal after it has lost its antlers. It will, therefore,\r\nbe of interest to examine the accompanying drawings, by Mr. L. Beckmann,\r\none of them showing a deer while shedding its antlers, and the other\r\nas the animal appears after losing them. In the first illustration the\r\nanimal has just lost one of its antlers, and fright and pain cause it\r\nto throw its head upward and become disturbed and uneasy. The remaining\r\nantler draws down one side of the head and is very inconvenient for the\r\nanimal. The remaining antler becomes soon detached from its base,\r\nand the deer turns--as if ashamed of having lost its ornament and\r\nweapon--lowers its head, and sorrowfully moves to the adjoining thicket,\r\nwhere it hides. A friend once observed a deer losing its antlers, but\r\nthe circumstances were somewhat different. The animal was jumping over a\r\nditch, and as soon as it touched the further bank it jumped high in the\r\nair, arched its back, bent its head to one side in the manner of an\r\nanimal that has been wounded, and then sadly approached the nearest\r\nthicket, in the same manner as the artist has represented in the\r\naccompanying picture. Both antlers dropped off and fell into the ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METAMORPHOSIS OF DEER'S ANTLERS.--FIRST STAGE.]\r\n\r\nStrong antlers are generally found together, but weak ones are lost at\r\nintervals of two or three days. A few days after this loss the stumps\r\nupon which the antlers rested are covered with a skin, which grows\r\nupward very rapidly, and under which the fresh antlers are formed, so\r\nthat by the end of July the bucks have new and strong antlers, from\r\nwhich they remove the fine hairy covering by rubbing them against young\r\ntrees. It is peculiar that the huntsman, who knows everything in regard\r\nto deer, and has seventy-two signs by which he can tell whether a male\r\nor female deer passes through the woods, does not know at what age the\r\ndeer gets its first antlers and how the antlers indicate the age of the\r\nanimal. Prof. Altum, in Eberswalde, has given some valuable information\r\nin regard to the relation between the age of the deer and the forms of\r\ntheir antlers, but in some respects he has not expressed himself very\r\nclearly, and I think that my observations given in addition to his may\r\nbe of importance. When the animal is a year old--that is, in June--the\r\nburrs of the antlers begin to form, and in July the animal has two\r\nprotuberances of the size of walnuts, from which the first branches of\r\nthe antlers rise; these branches having the length of a finger only, or\r\nbeing even shorter, as shown at 1, in diagram, on p. 5481. After the\r\nsecond year more branches are formed, which are considerably longer and\r\nmuch rougher at the lower ends than the first. The third pair of antlers\r\nis different from its predecessors, inasmuch as it has \"roses,\" that is,\r\nannular ridges around the bases of the horn, which latter are now bent\r\nin the shape of a crescent. Either the antler has a single branch (Fig.\r\n3, _a_), or besides the point it has another short end, which is a most\r\nrare shape, and is known as a \"fork\" (Fig. 3, _b_), or it has two forks\r\n(Fig. 3, _c_). In the following year the antlers take the form shown\r\nin Fig. 4, and then follows the antler shown in Fig. 5, _a_, which\r\ngenerally has \"forks\" in place of points, and is known as forked antler\r\nin contradistinction to the point antler shown in Fig. 5, _b_, which\r\nretains the shape of the antler, Fig. 4, but has additional or\r\nintermediate prongs or branches. The huntsmen designate the antlers by\r\nthe number of ends or points on the two antlers. For instance, Fig. 4 is\r\na six-ender; Fig. 5 shows an eight-ender, etc.; and antlers have been\r\nknown to have as many as twenty-two ends. If the two antlers do not\r\nhave the same number of ends the number of ends on the larger antler\r\nis multiplied by two and the word \"odd\" is placed before the word\r\ndesignating the number of ends. For instance, if one antler has\r\nthree ends and the other four, the antler would be termed an \"odd\"\r\neight-ender. The sixth antler shown in Fig. 6 is a ten-ender, and\r\nappears in two different forms, either with a fork at the upper end, as\r\nshown in Fig. 6, _a_, or with a crown, as shown in Fig. 6, _b_. In Fig.\r\n7 an antler is shown which the animal carries from its seventh year\r\nuntil the month of March of its eighth year. From that time on the\r\ncrowns only increase and change. The increase in the number of points is\r\nnot always as regular as I have described it, for in years when food\r\nis scarce and poor the antlers are weak and small, and when food is\r\nplentiful and rich the antlers grow exceedingly large, and sometimes\r\nskip an entire year's growth.--_Karl Brandt, in Leipziger lllustrirte\r\nZeitung_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METAMORPHOSIS OF DEER'S ANTLERS.--SECOND STAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKEYS.\r\n\r\nBy ALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the skeleton of an orang-outang and a chimpanzee be compared with\r\nthat of a man, there will be found to be the most wonderful resemblance,\r\ntogether with a very marked diversity. Bone for bone, throughout the\r\nwhole structure, will be found to agree in general form, position, and\r\nfunction, the only absolute differences being that the orang has nine\r\nwrist bones, whereas man and the chimpanzee have but eight; and the\r\nchimpanzee has thirteen pairs of ribs, whereas the orang, like man, has\r\nbut twelve. With these two exceptions, the differences are those of\r\nshape, proportion, and direction only, though the resulting differences\r\nin the external form and motions are very considerable. The greatest of\r\nthese are, that the feet of the anthropoid or man-like apes, as well as\r\nthose of all monkeys, are formed like hands, with large opposable thumbs\r\nfitted to grasp the branches of trees, but unsuitable for erect walking,\r\nwhile the hands have weak, small thumbs, but very long and powerful\r\nfingers, forming a hook, rather than a hand, adapted for climbing up\r\ntrees and suspending the whole weight from horizontal branches. The\r\nalmost complete identity of the skeleton, however, and the close\r\nsimilarity of the muscles and of all the internal organs, have produced\r\nthat striking and ludicrous resemblance to man, which every one\r\nrecognizes in these higher apes, and, in a less degree, in the whole\r\nmonkey tribe; the face and features, the motions, attitudes, and\r\ngestures being often a strange caricature of humanity. Let us, then,\r\nexamine a little more closely in what the resemblance consists, and how\r\nfar, and to what extent, these animals really differ from us.\r\n\r\nBesides the face, which is often wonderfully human--although the absence\r\nof any protuberant nose gives it often a curiously infantile aspect,\r\nmonkeys, and especially apes, resemble us most closely in the hand and\r\narm. The hand has well-formed fingers, with nails, and the skin of the\r\npalm is lined and furrowed like our own. The thumb is, however, smaller\r\nand weaker than ours, and is not so much used in taking hold of\r\nanything. The monkey's hand is, therefore, not so well adapted as that\r\nof man for a variety of purposes, and cannot be applied with such\r\nprecision in holding small objects, while it is unsuitable for\r\nperforming delicate operations, such as tying a knot or writing with a\r\npen. A monkey does not take hold of a nut with its forefinger and thumb,\r\nas we do, but grasps it between the fingers and the palm in a clumsy\r\nway, just as a baby does before it has acquired the proper use of\r\nits hand. Two groups of monkeys--one in Africa and one in South\r\nAmerica--have no thumbs on their hands, and yet they do not seem to be\r\nin any respect inferior to other kinds which possess it. In most of the\r\nAmerican monkeys the thumb bends in the same direction as the fingers,\r\nand in none is it so perfectly opposed to the fingers as our thumbs are;\r\nand all these circumstances show that the hand of the monkey is, both\r\nstructurally and functionally, a very different and very inferior organ\r\nto that of man, since it is not applied to similar purposes, nor is it\r\ncapable of being so applied.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the feet of monkeys we find a still greater difference,\r\nfor these have much larger and more opposable thumbs, and are therefore\r\nmore like our hands; and this is the case with all monkeys, so that even\r\nthose which have no thumbs on their hands, or have them small and weak\r\nand parallel to the fingers, have always large and well-formed thumbs on\r\ntheir feet. It was on account of this peculiarity that the great French\r\nnaturalist Cuvier named the whole group of monkeys Quadrumana, or\r\nfour-handed animals, because, besides the two hands on their fore-limbs,\r\nthey have also two hands in place of feet on their hind-limbs. Modern\r\nnaturalists have given up the use of this term, because they say that\r\nthe hind extremities of all monkeys are really feet, only these feet\r\nare shaped like hands; but this is a point of anatomy, or rather of\r\nnomenclature, which we need not here discuss.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, before going further, inquire into the purpose and\r\nuse of this peculiarity, and we shall then see that it is simply an\r\nadaptation to the mode of life of the animals which possess it. Monkeys,\r\nas a rule, live in trees, and are especially abundant in the great\r\ntropical forests. They feed chiefly upon fruits, and occasionally eat\r\ninsects and birds'-eggs, as well as young birds, all of which they find\r\nin the trees; and, as they have no occasion to come down to the ground,\r\nthey travel from tree to tree by jumping or swinging, and thus pass the\r\ngreater part of their lives entirely among the leafy branches of lofty\r\ntrees. For such a mode of existence, they require to be able to move\r\nwith perfect ease upon large or small branches, and to climb up rapidly\r\nfrom one bough to another. As they use their hands for gathering fruit\r\nand catching insects or birds, they require some means of holding on\r\nwith their feet, otherwise they would be liable to continual falls, and\r\nthey are able to do this by means of their long finger-like toes and\r\nlarge opposable thumbs, which grasp a branch almost as securely as a\r\nbird grasps its perch. The true hands, on the contrary, are used chiefly\r\nto climb with, and to swing the whole weight of the body from one branch\r\nor one tree to another, and for this purpose the fingers are very long\r\nand strong, and in many species they are further strengthened by being\r\npartially joined together, as if the skin of our fingers grew together\r\nas far as the knuckles. This shows that the separate action of the\r\nfingers, which is so important to us, is little required by monkeys,\r\nwhose hand is really an organ for climbing and seizing food, while their\r\nfoot is required to support them firmly in any position on the branches\r\nof trees, and for this purpose it has become modified into a large and\r\npowerful grasping hand.\r\n\r\nAnother striking difference between monkeys and men is that the former\r\nnever walk with ease in an erect posture, but always use their arms in\r\nclimbing or in walking on all-fours like most quadrupeds. The monkeys\r\nthat we see in the streets dressed up and walking erect, only do so\r\nafter much drilling and teaching, just as dogs may be taught to walk in\r\nthe same way; and the posture is almost as unnatural to the one animal\r\nas it is to the other. The largest and most man-like of the apes--the\r\ngorilla, chimpanzee, and orang-outang--also walk usually on all-fours;\r\nbut in these the arms are so long and the legs so short that the body\r\nappears half erect when walking; and they have the habit of resting on\r\nthe knuckles of the hands, not on the palms like the smaller monkeys,\r\nwhose arms and legs are more nearly of an equal length, which tends\r\nstill further to give them a semi-erect position. Still they are never\r\nknown to walk of their own accord on their hind legs only, though they\r\ncan do so for short distances, and the story of their using a stick and\r\nwalking erect by its help in the wild state is not true. Monkeys, then,\r\nare both four-handed and four-footed beasts; they possess four hands\r\nformed very much like our hands, and capable of picking up or holding\r\nany small object in the same manner; but they are also four-footed,\r\nbecause they use all four limbs for the purpose of walking, running, or\r\nclimbing; and, being adapted to this double purpose, the hands want the\r\ndelicacy of touch and the freedom as well as the precision of movement\r\nwhich ours possess. Man alone is so constructed that he walks erect with\r\nperfect ease, and has his hands free for any use to which he wishes\r\nto apply them; and this is the great and essential bodily distinction\r\nbetween monkeys and men.\r\n\r\nWe will now give some account of the different kinds of monkeys and the\r\ncountries they inhabit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MONKEYS AND THE COUNTRIES THEY INHABIT.\r\n\r\nMonkeys are usually divided into three kinds--apes, monkeys, and\r\nbaboons; but these do not include the American monkeys, which are really\r\nmore different from all those of the Old World than any of the\r\nlatter are from each other. Naturalists, therefore, divide the whole\r\nmonkey-tribe into two great families, inhabiting the Old and the New\r\nWorld respectively; and, if we learn to remember the kind of differences\r\nby which these several groups are distinguished, we shall be able\r\nto understand something of the classification of animals, and the\r\ndifference between important and unimportant characters.\r\n\r\nTaking first the Old World groups, they may be thus defined: apes have\r\nno tails; monkeys have tails, which are usually long; while baboons have\r\nshort tails, and their faces, instead of being round and with a man-like\r\nexpression as in apes and monkeys, are long and more dog-like. These\r\ndifferences are, however, by no means constant, and it is often\r\ndifficult to tell whether an animal should be classed as an ape, a\r\nmonkey, or a baboon. The Gibraltar ape, for example, though it has no\r\ntail, is really a monkey, because it has callosities, or hard pads of\r\nbare skin on which it sits, and cheek pouches in which it can stow away\r\nfood; the latter character being always absent in the true apes, while\r\nboth are present in most monkeys and baboons. All these animals,\r\nhowever, from the largest ape to the smallest monkey, have the same\r\nnumber of teeth as we have, and they are arranged in a similar manner,\r\nalthough the tusks or canine teeth of the males are often large, like\r\nthose of a dog.\r\n\r\nThe American monkeys, on the other hand, with the exception of the\r\nmarmosets, have four additional grinding teeth (one in each jaw on\r\neither side), and none of them have callosities, or cheek pouches. They\r\nnever have prominent snouts like the baboons; their nostrils are placed\r\nwide apart and open sideways on the face; the tail, though sometimes\r\nshort, is never quite absent; and the thumb bends the same way as the\r\nfingers, is generally very short and weak, and is often quite wanting.\r\nWe thus see that these American monkeys differ in a great number of\r\ncharacters from those of the Eastern hemisphere; and they have this\r\nfurther peculiarity, that many of them have prehensile or grasping\r\ntails, which are never found in the monkeys of any other country.\r\nThis curious organ serves the purpose of a fifth hand. It has so much\r\nmuscular power that the animal can hang by it easily with the tip curled\r\nround a branch, while it can also be used to pick up small objects with\r\nalmost as much ease and exactness as an elephant's trunk. In those\r\nspecies which have it most perfectly formed it is very long and\r\npowerful, and the end has the underside covered with bare skin, exactly\r\nresembling that of the finger or palm of the hand and apparently equally\r\nsensitive. One of the common kinds of monkeys that accompany street\r\norgan-players has a prehensile tail, but not of the most perfect kind;\r\nsince in this species the tail is entirely clad with hair to the tip,\r\nand seems to be used chiefly to steady the animal when sitting on a\r\nbranch by being twisted round another branch near it. The statement is\r\noften erroneously made that all American monkeys have prehensile tails;\r\nbut the fact is that rather less than half the known kinds have them\r\nso, the remainder having this organ either short and bushy, or long\r\nand slender, but entirely without any power of grasping. All\r\nprehensile-tailed monkeys are American, but all American monkeys are not\r\nprehensile-tailed.\r\n\r\nBy remembering these characters it is easy, with a little observation,\r\nto tell whether any strange monkey comes from America or from the Old\r\nWorld. If it has bare seat-pads, or if when eating it fills its mouth\r\ntill its cheeks swell out like little bags, we may be sure it comes from\r\nsome part of Africa or Asia; while if it can curl up the end of its tail\r\nso as to take hold of anything, it is certainly American. As all the\r\ntailed monkeys of the Old World have seat-pads (or ischial callosities\r\nas they are called in scientific language), and as all the American\r\nmonkeys have tails, but no seat-pads, this is the most constant external\r\ncharacter by which to distinguish them; and having done so we can look\r\nfor the other peculiarities of the American monkeys, especially the\r\ndistance apart of the nostrils and their lateral position.\r\n\r\nThe whole monkey-tribe is especially tropical, only a few kinds being\r\nfound in the warmer parts of the temperate zone. One inhabits the Rock\r\nof Gibraltar, and there is one very like it in Japan, and these are the\r\ntwo monkeys which live furthest from the equator. In the tropics they\r\nbecome very abundant and increase in numbers and variety as we approach\r\nthe equator, where the climate is hot, moist, and equable, and where\r\nflowers, fruits, and insects are to be found throughout the year. Africa\r\nhas about 55 different kinds, Asia and its islands about 60, while\r\nAmerica has 114, or almost exactly the same as Asia and Africa together.\r\nAustralia and its islands have no monkeys, nor has the great and\r\nluxuriant island of New Guinea, whose magnificent forests seem so well\r\nadapted for them. We will now give a short account of the different\r\nkinds of monkeys inhabiting each of the tropical continents.\r\n\r\nAfrica possesses two of the great man-like apes--the gorilla and the\r\nchimpanzee, the former being the largest ape known, and the one which,\r\non the whole, perhaps most resembles man, though its countenance is less\r\nhuman than that of the chimpanzee. Both are found in West Africa, near\r\nthe equator, but they also inhabit the interior wherever there are great\r\nforests; and Dr. Schweinfurth states that the chimpanzee inhabits the\r\ncountry about the sources of the Shari River in 28° E. long. and 4° N.\r\nlat.\r\n\r\nThe long-tailed monkeys of Africa are very numerous and varied. One\r\ngroup has no cheek pouches and no thumb on the hand, and many of these\r\nhave long soft fur of varied colors. The most numerous group are the\r\nGuenons, rather small long-tailed monkeys, very active and lively,\r\nand often having their faces curiously marked with white or black, or\r\nornamented with whiskers or other tufts of hair; and they all have large\r\ncheek pouches and good sized thumbs. Many of them are called green\r\nmonkeys, from the greenish yellow tint of their fur, and most of them\r\nare well formed, pleasing animals. They are found only in tropical\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe baboons are larger but less numerous. They resemble dogs in the\r\ngeneral form and the length of the face or snout, but they have hands\r\nwith well-developed thumbs on both the fore and hind limbs; and this,\r\nwith something in the expression of the face and their habit of sitting\r\nup and using their hands in a very human fashion, at once shows that\r\nthey belong to the monkey tribe. Many of them are very ugly, and in\r\ntheir wild state they are the fiercest and most dangerous of monkeys.\r\nSome have the tail very long, others of medium length, while it is\r\nsometimes reduced to a mere stump, and all have large cheek pouches and\r\nbare seat pads. They are found all over Africa, from Egypt to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope; while one species, called the hamadryas, extends from\r\nAbyssinia across the Red Sea into Arabia, and is the only baboon found\r\nout of Africa. This species was known to the ancients, and it is often\r\nrepresented in Egyptian sculptures, while mummies of it have been found\r\nin the catacombs. The largest and most remarkable of all the baboons\r\nis the mandrill of West Africa, whose swollen and hog-like face is\r\nornamented with stripes of vivid blue and scarlet. This animal has a\r\ntail scarcely two inches long, while in size and strength it is not much\r\ninferior to the gorilla. The large baboons go in bands, and are said to\r\nbe a match for any other animals in the African forests, and even to\r\nattack and drive away the elephants from the districts they inhabit.\r\n\r\nTurning now to Asia, we have first one of the best known of the large\r\nman-like apes--the orang-outang, found only in the two large islands,\r\nBorneo and Sumatra. The name is Malay, signifying \"man of the woods,\"\r\nand it should be pronounced órang-óotan, the accent being on the first\r\nsyllable of both words. It is a very curious circumstance that, whereas\r\nthe gorilla and chimpanzee are both black, like the negroes of the same\r\ncountry, the orang-outang is red or reddish brown, closely resembling\r\nthe color of the Malays and Dyaks who live in the Bornean forests.\r\nThough very large and powerful, it is a harmless creature, feeding on\r\nfruit, and never attacking any other animal except in self-defense. A\r\nfull-grown male orang-outang is rather more than four feet high, but\r\nwith a body as large as that of a stout man, and with enormously long\r\nand powerful arms.\r\n\r\nAnother group of true apes inhabit Asia and the larger Asiatic islands,\r\nand are in some respects the most remarkable of the whole family. These\r\nare the Gibbons, or long-armed apes, which are generally of small size\r\nand of a gentle disposition, but possessing the most wonderful agility.\r\nIn these creatures the arms are as long as the body and legs together,\r\nand are so powerful that a gibbon will hang for hours suspended from\r\na branch, or swing to and fro and then throw itself a great distance\r\nthrough the air. The arms, in fact, completely take the place of the\r\nlegs for traveling. Instead of jumping from bough to bough and running\r\non the branches, like other apes and monkeys, the gibbons move along\r\nwhile hanging suspended in the air, stretching their arms from bough to\r\nbough, and thus going hand over hand as a very active sailor will climb\r\nalong a rope. The strength of their arms is, however, so prodigious,\r\nand their hold so sure, that they often loose one hand before they have\r\ncaught a bough with the other, thus seeming almost to fly through the\r\nair by a series of swinging leaps; and they travel among the network of\r\ninterlacing boughs a hundred feet above the earth with as much ease and\r\ncertainty as we walk or run upon level ground, and with even greater\r\nspeed. These little animals scarcely ever come down to the ground of\r\ntheir own accord; but when obliged to do so they run along almost erect,\r\nwith their long arms swinging round and round, as if trying to find some\r\ntree or other object to climb upon. They are the only apes who naturally\r\nwalk without using their hands as well as their feet; but this does not\r\nmake them more like men, for it is evident that the attitude is not an\r\neasy one, and is only adopted because the arms are habitually used to\r\nswing by, and are therefore naturally held upward, instead of downward,\r\nas they must be when walking on them.\r\n\r\nThe tailed monkeys of Asia consist of two groups, the first of which\r\nhave no cheek pouches, but always have very long tails, They are\r\ntrue forest monkeys, very active and of a shy disposition. The most\r\nremarkable of these is the long-nosed monkey of Borneo, which is very\r\nlarge, of a pale brown color, and distinguished by possessing a long,\r\npointed, fleshy nose, totally unlike that of all other monkeys. Another\r\ninteresting species is the black and white entellus monkey of India,\r\ncalled the \"Hanuman,\" by the Hindoos, and considered sacred by them.\r\nThese animals are petted and fed, and at some of the temples numbers\r\nof them come every day for the food which the priests, as well as the\r\npeople, provide for them.\r\n\r\nThe next group of Eastern monkeys are the Macaques, which are more like\r\nbaboons, and often run upon the ground. They are more bold and vicious\r\nthan the others. All have cheek pouches, and though some have long\r\ntails, in others the tail is short, or reduced to a mere stump. In some\r\nfew this stump is so very short that there appears to be no tail, as in\r\nthe magot of North Africa and Gibraltar, and in an allied species that\r\ninhabits Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys which inhabit America form three very distinct groups:\r\n1st, the Sapajous, which have prehensile or grasping tails; 2nd, the\r\nSagouins, which have ordinary tails, either long or short; and, 3rd, the\r\nMarmosets, very small creatures, with sharp claws, long tails which are\r\nnot prehensile, and a smaller number of teeth than all other American\r\nmonkeys. Each of these three groups contain several sub-groups, or\r\n_genera_, which often differ remarkably from each other, and from all\r\nthe monkeys of the Old World.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the howling monkeys, which are the largest found in\r\nAmerica, and are celebrated for the loud voice of the males. Often in\r\nthe great forests of the Amazon or Oronooko a tremendous noise is heard\r\nin the night or early morning, as if a great assemblage of wild beasts\r\nwere all roaring and screaming together. The noise may be heard for\r\nmiles, and it is louder and more piercing than that of any other\r\nanimals, yet it is all produced by a single male howler, sitting on the\r\nbranches of some lofty tree. They are enabled to make this extraordinary\r\nnoise by means of an organ that is possessed by no other animal. The\r\nlower jaw is unusually deep, and this makes room for a hollow bony\r\nvessel about the size of a large walnut, situated under the root of the\r\ntongue, and having an opening into the windpipe by which the animal\r\ncan force air into it. This increases the power of its voice, acting\r\nsomething like the hollow case of a violin, and producing those\r\nmarvelous rolling and reverberating sounds which caused the celebrated\r\ntraveler Waterton to declare that they were such as might have had their\r\norigin in the infernal regions. The howlers are large and stout bodied\r\nmonkeys, with bearded faces, and very strong and powerfully grasping\r\ntails. They inhabit the wildest forests; they are very shy, and are\r\nseldom taken captive, though they are less active than many other\r\nAmerican monkeys.\r\n\r\nNext come the spider monkeys, so called from their slender bodies and\r\nenormously long limbs and tail. In these monkeys the tail is so long,\r\nstrong, and perfect, that it completely takes the place of a fifth hand.\r\nBy twisting the end of it round a branch the animal can swing freely in\r\nthe air with complete safety; and this gives them a wonderful power of\r\nclimbing end passing from tree to tree, because the distance they can\r\nstretch is that of the tail, body, and arm added together, and these are\r\nall unusually long. They can also swing themselves through the air for\r\ngreat distances, and are thus able to pass rapidly from tree to tree\r\nwithout ever descending to the ground, just like the gibbons in the\r\nMalayan forests. Although capable of feats of wonderful agility, the\r\nspider monkeys are usually slow and deliberate in their motions, and\r\nhave a timid, melancholy expression, very different from that of most\r\nmonkeys. Their hands are very long, but have only four fingers, being\r\nadapted for hanging on to branches rather than for getting hold of small\r\nobjects. It is said that when they have to cross a river the trees on\r\nthe opposite banks of which do not approach near enough for a leap,\r\nseveral of them form a chain, one hanging by its tail from a lofty\r\noverhanging branch and seizing hold of the tail of the one below it,\r\nthen gradually swinging themselves backward and forward till the lower\r\none is able to seize hold of a branch on the opposite side. He then\r\nclimbs up the tree, and, when sufficiently high, the first one lets go,\r\nand the swing either carries him across to a bough on the opposite side\r\nor he climbs up over his companions.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the last are the woolly monkeys, which have an equally\r\nwell developed prehensile tail, but better proportioned limbs, and a\r\nthick woolly fur of a uniform gray or brownish color. They have well\r\nformed fingers and thumbs, both on the hands and feet, and are rather\r\ndeliberate in their motions, and exceedingly tame and affectionate in\r\ncaptivity. They are great eaters, and are usually very fat. They are\r\nfound only in the far interior of the Amazon valley, and, having a\r\ndelicate constitution, seldom live long in Europe. These monkeys are not\r\nso fond of swinging themselves about by their tails as are the spider\r\nmonkeys, and offer more opportunities of observing how completely this\r\norgan takes the place of a fifth hand. When walking about a house, or on\r\nthe deck of a ship, the partially curled tail is carried in a horizontal\r\nposition on the ground, and the moment it touches anything it twists\r\nround it and brings it forward, when, if eatable, it is at once\r\nappropriated; and when fastened up the animal will obtain any food that\r\nmay be out of reach of its hands with the greatest facility, picking up\r\nsmall bits of biscuit, nuts, etc., much as an elephant does with the tip\r\nof his trunk.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a group of monkeys whose prehensile tail is of a less\r\nperfect character, since it is covered with hair to the tip, and is of\r\nno use to pick up objects. It can, however, curl round a branch, and\r\nserves to steady the animal while sitting or feeding, but is never used\r\nto hang and swing by in the manner so common with the spider monkeys and\r\ntheir allies. These are rather small-sized animals, with round heads and\r\nwith moderately long tails. They are very active and intelligent, their\r\nlimbs are not so long as in the preceding group, and though they have\r\nfive fingers on each hand and foot, the hands have weak and hardly\r\nopposable thumbs. Some species of these monkeys are often carried about\r\nby itinerant organ men, and are taught to walk erect and perform many\r\namusing tricks. They form the genus _Cebus_ of naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the American monkeys have non-prehensile tails, like\r\nthose of the monkeys of the Eastern hemisphere; but they consist of\r\nseveral distinct groups, and differ very much in appearance and habits.\r\nFirst we have the Sakis, which have a bushy tail and usually very long\r\nand thick hair, something like that of a bear. Sometimes the tail is\r\nvery short, appearing like a rounded tuft of hair; many of the species\r\nhave fine bushy whiskers, which meet under the chin, and appear as if\r\nthey had been dressed and trimmed by a barber, and the head is often\r\ncovered with thick curly hair, looking like a wig. Others, again, have\r\nthe face quite red, and one has the head nearly bald, a most remarkable\r\npeculiarity among monkeys. This latter species was met with by Mr. Bates\r\non the Upper Amazon, and he describes the face as being of a vivid\r\nscarlet, the body clothed from neck to tail with very long, straight,\r\nand shining white hair, while the head was nearly bald, owing to the\r\nvery short crop of thin gray hairs. As a finish to their striking\r\nphysiognomy these monkeys have bushy whiskers of a sandy color meeting\r\nunder the chin, and yellowish gray eyes. The color of the face is so\r\nvivid that it looks as if covered with a thick coat of bright scarlet\r\npaint. These creatures are very delicate, and have never reached Europe\r\nalive, although several of the allied forms have lived some time in our\r\nZoological Gardens.\r\n\r\nAn allied group consists of the elegant squirrel monkeys, with long,\r\nstraight, hairy tails, and often adorned with pretty variegated colors.\r\nThey are usually small animals; some have the face marked with black and\r\nwhite, others have curious whiskers, and their nails are rather sharp\r\nand claw like. They have large round heads, and their fur is more glossy\r\nand smooth than in most other American monkeys, so that they more\r\nresemble some of the smaller monkeys of Africa. These little creatures\r\nare very active, running about the trees like squirrels, and feeding\r\nlargely on insects as well as on fruit.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these are the small group of night monkeys, which have\r\nlarge eyes, and a round face surrounded by a kind of ruff of whitish\r\nfur, so as to give it an owl like appearance, whence they are sometimes\r\ncalled owl-faced monkeys. They are covered with soft gray fur, like that\r\nof a rabbit, and sleep all day long concealed in hollow trees. The\r\nface is also marked with white patches and stripes, giving it a rather\r\ncarnivorous or cat like aspect, which, perhaps, serves as a protection,\r\nby causing the defenseless creature to be taken for an arboreal tiger\r\ncat or some such beast of prey.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the series of such of the American monkeys as have a\r\nlarger number of teeth than those of the Old World. But there is another\r\ngroup, the Marmosets, which have the same number of teeth as Eastern\r\nmonkeys, but differently distributed in the jaws, a premolar being\r\nsubstituted for a molar tooth. In other particulars they resemble the\r\nrest of the American monkeys. They are very small and delicate creatures\r\nsome having the body only seven inches long. The thumb of the hands\r\nis[1] not opposable, and instead of nails they have sharp compressed\r\nclaws. These diminutive monkeys have long, non-prehensile tails, and\r\nthey have a silky fur often of varied and beautiful colors. Some are\r\nstriped with gray and white, or are of rich brown or golden brown tints,\r\nvaried by having the head or shoulders white or black, while in many\r\nthere are crests, frills, manes, or long ear tufts, adding greatly to\r\ntheir variety and beauty. These little animals are timid and restless;\r\ntheir motions are more like those of a squirrel than a monkey. Their\r\nsharp claws enable them to run quickly along the branches, but they\r\nseldom leap from bough to bough like the larger monkeys. They live on\r\nfruits and insects, but are much afraid of wasps, which they are said to\r\nrecognize even in a picture.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: Changed from '... it not opposable', ...]\r\n\r\nThis completes our sketch of the American monkeys, and we see that,\r\nalthough they possess no such remarkable forms as the gorilla or the\r\nbaboons, yet they exhibit a wonderful diversity of external characters,\r\nconsidering that all seem equally adapted to a purely arboreal life.\r\nIn the howlers we have a specially developed voice organ, which is\r\naltogether peculiar; in the spider monkeys we find the adaptation to\r\nactive motion among the topmost branches of the forest trees carried to\r\nan extreme point of development; while the singular nocturnal monkeys,\r\nthe active squirrel monkeys, and the exquisite little marmosets, show\r\nhow distinct are the forms under which the same general type, may be\r\nexhibited, and in how many varied ways existence may be sustained under\r\nalmost identical conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMURS.\r\n\r\nIn the general term, monkeys, considered as equivalent to the order\r\nPrimates, or the Quadrumana of naturalists, we have to include another\r\nsub-type, that of the Lemurs. These animals are of a lower grade than\r\nthe true monkeys, from which they differ in so many points of structure\r\nthat they are considered to form a distinct sub-order, or, by some\r\nnaturalists, even a separate order. They have usually a much larger head\r\nand more pointed muzzle than monkeys; they vary considerably in the\r\nnumber, form, and arrangement of the teeth; their thumbs are always well\r\ndeveloped, but their fingers vary much in size and length; their tails\r\nare usually long, but several species have no tail whatever, and they\r\nare clothed with a more or less woolly fur, often prettily variegated\r\nwith white and black. They inhabit the deep forests of Africa,\r\nMadagascar, and Southern Asia, and are more sluggish in their movements\r\nthan true monkeys, most of them being of nocturnal and crepuscular\r\nhabits. They feed largely on insects, eating also fruits and the eggs or\r\nyoung of birds.\r\n\r\nThe most curious species are--the slow lemurs of South India, small\r\ntailless nocturnal animals, somewhat resembling sloths in appearance,\r\nand almost as deliberate in their movements, except when in the act of\r\nseizing their insect prey; the Tarsier, or specter lemur, of the Malay\r\nislands, a small, long tailed nocturnal lemur, remarkable for the\r\ncurious development of the hind feet, which have two of the toes very\r\nshort, and with sharp claws, while the others have nails, the third toe\r\nbeing exceedingly long and slender, though the thumb is very large,\r\ngiving the feet a very irregular and _outré_ appearance; and, lastly,\r\nthe Aye-aye, of Madagascar, the most remarkable of all. This animal has\r\nvery large ears and a squirrel like tail, with long spreading hair.\r\nIt has large curved incisor teeth, which add to its squirrel like\r\nappearance, and caused the early naturalists to class it among the\r\nrodents. But its most remarkable character is found in its fore feet\r\nor hands, the fingers of which are all very long and armed with sharp\r\ncurved claws, but one of them, the second, is wonderfully slender,\r\nbeing not half the thickness of the others. This curious combination of\r\ncharacters shows that the aye-aye is a very specialized form--that is,\r\none whose organization has been slowly modified to fit it for a peculiar\r\nmode of life. From information received from its native country, and\r\nfrom a profound study of its organization, Professor Owen believes\r\nthat it is adapted for the one purpose of feeding on small wood-boring\r\ninsects. Its large feet and sharp claws enable it to cling firmly to the\r\nbranches of trees in almost any position; by means of its large delicate\r\nears it listens for the sound of the insect gnawing within the branch,\r\nand is thus able to fix its exact position; with its powerful curved\r\ngnawing teeth it rapidly cuts away the bark and wood till it exposes the\r\nburrow of the insect, most probably the soft larva of some beetle, and\r\nthen comes into play the extraordinary long wire-like finger, which\r\nenters the small cylindrical burrow, and with the sharp bent claw hooks\r\nout the grub. Here we have a most complex adaptation of different parts\r\nand organs, all converging to one special end, that end being the same\r\nas is reached by a group of birds, the woodpeckers, in a different way;\r\nand it is a most interesting fact that, although woodpeckers abound in\r\nall the great continents, and are especially common in the tropical\r\nforests of Asia, Africa, and America, they are quite absent from\r\nMadagascar. We may, therefore, consider that the aye-aye really occupies\r\nthe same place in nature in the forests of this tropical island, as do\r\nthe woodpeckers in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION, AFFINITIES, AND ZOOLOGICAL RANK OF MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched an outline of the monkey tribe as regards their\r\nmore prominent external characters and habits, we must say a few words\r\non their general relations as a distinct order of mammalia. No other\r\ngroup so extensive and so varied as this, is so exclusively tropical in\r\nits distribution, a circumstance no doubt due to the fact that monkeys\r\ndepend so largely on fruit and insects for their subsistence. A very\r\nfew species extend into the warmer parts of the temperate zones, their\r\nextreme limits in the northern hemisphere being Gibraltar, the Western\r\nHimalayas at 11,000 feet elevation, East Thibet, and Japan. In America\r\nthey are found in Mexico, but do not appear to pass beyond the tropic.\r\nIn the Southern hemisphere they are limited by the extent of the forests\r\nin South Brazil, which reach about 30° south latitude. In the East,\r\nowing to their entire absence from Australia, they do not reach the\r\ntropic; but in Africa, some baboons range to the southern extremity of\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nBut this extreme restriction of the order to almost tropical lands is\r\nonly recent. Directly we go back to the Pliocene period of geology,\r\nwe find the remains of monkeys in France, and even in England. In the\r\nearlier Miocene, several kinds, some of large size, lived in France,\r\nGermany, and Greece, all more or less closely allied to living forms of\r\nAsia and Africa. About the same period monkeys of the South American\r\ntype inhabited the United States. In the remote Eocene period the same\r\ntemperate lands were inhabited by lemurs in the East, and by curious\r\nanimals believed to be intermediate between lemurs and marmosets in the\r\nWest. We know from a variety of other evidence that throughout these\r\nvast periods a mild and almost sub-tropical climate extended over all\r\nCentral Europe and parts of North America, while one of a temperate\r\ncharacter prevailed as far north as the Arctic circle. The monkey tribe\r\nthen enjoyed a far greater range over the earth, and perhaps filled a\r\nmore important place in nature than it does now. Its restriction to the\r\ncomparatively narrow limits of the tropics is no doubt mainly due to the\r\ngreat alteration of climate which occurred at the close of the Tertiary\r\nperiod, but it may have been aided by the continuous development of\r\nvaried forms of mammalian life better fitted for the contrasted seasons\r\nand deciduous vegetation of the north temperate regions. The more\r\nextensive area formerly inhabited by the monkey tribe, would have\r\nfavored their development into a number of divergent forms, in distant\r\nregions, and adapted to distinct modes of life. As these retreated\r\nsouthward and became concentrated in a more limited area, such as were\r\nable to maintain themselves became mingled together as we now find them,\r\nthe ancient and lowly marmosets and lemurs subsisting side by side with\r\nthe more recent and more highly developed howlers and anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nThroughout the long ages of the Tertiary period monkeys must have been\r\nvery abundant and very varied, yet it is but rarely that their fossil\r\nremains are found. This, however, is not difficult to explain. The\r\ndeposits in which mammalian remains most abound are those formed in\r\nlakes or in caverns. In the former the bodies of large numbers of\r\nterrestrial animals were annually deposited, owing to their having been\r\ncaught by floods in the tributary streams, swallowed up in marginal bogs\r\nor quicksands, or drowned by the giving way of ice. Caverns were the\r\nhaunts of hyenas, tigers, bears, and other beasts of prey, which dragged\r\ninto them the bodies of their victims, and left many of their bones to\r\nbecome embedded in stalagmite or in the muddy deposit left by floods,\r\nwhile herbivorous animals were often carried into them by these floods,\r\nor by falling down the swallow-holes which often open into caverns from\r\nabove. But, owing to their arboreal habits, monkeys were to a great\r\nextent freed from all these dangers. Whether devoured by beasts or birds\r\nof prey, or dying a natural death, their bones would usually be left on\r\ndry land, where they would slowly decay under atmospheric influences.\r\nOnly under very exceptional circumstances would they become embedded\r\nin aqueous deposits; and instead of being surprised at their rarity\r\nwe should rather wonder that so many have been discovered in a fossil\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nMonkeys, as a whole, form a very isolated group, having no near\r\nrelations to any other mammalia. This is undoubtedly an indication of\r\ngreat antiquity. The peculiar type which has since reached so high a\r\ndevelopment must have branched off the great mammalian stock at a very\r\nremote epoch, certainly far back in the Secondary period, since in the\r\nEocene we find lemurs and lemurine monkeys already specialized. At this\r\nremoter period they were probably not separable from the insectivora,\r\nor (perhaps) from the ancestral marsupials. Even now we have one living\r\nform, the curious Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which has only recently\r\nbeen separated from the lemurs, with which it was formerly united, to be\r\nclassed as one of the insectivora; and it is only among the Opossums and\r\nsome other marsupials that we again find hand-like feet with opposable\r\nthumbs, which are such a curious and constant feature of the monkey\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThis relationship to the lowest of the mammalian tribes seems\r\ninconsistent with the place usually accorded to these animals at the\r\nhead of the entire mammalian series, and opens up the question whether\r\nthis is a real superiority or whether it depends merely on the obvious\r\nrelationship to ourselves. If we could suppose a being gifted with\r\nhigh intelligence, but with a form totally unlike that of man, to have\r\nvisited the earth before man existed in order to study the various forms\r\nof animal life that were found there, we can hardly think he would have\r\nplaced the monkey tribe so high as we do. He would observe that their\r\nwhole organization was specially adapted to an arboreal life, and this\r\nspecialization would be rather against their claiming the first rank\r\namong terrestrial creatures. Neither in size, nor strength, nor beauty,\r\nwould they compare with many other forms, while in intelligence they\r\nwould not surpass, even if they equaled, the horse or the beaver. The\r\ncarnivora, as a whole, would certainly be held to surpass them in the\r\nexquisite perfection of their physical structure, while the flexible\r\ntrunk of the elephant, combined with his vast strength and admirable\r\nsagacity, would probably gain for him the first rank in the animal\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nBut if this would have been a true estimate, the mere fact that the ape\r\nis our nearest relation does not necessarily oblige us to come to any\r\nother conclusion. Man is undoubtedly the most perfect of all animals,\r\nbut he is so solely in respect of characters in which he differs from\r\nall the monkey tribe--the easily erect posture, the perfect freedom\r\nof the hands from all part in locomotion, the large size and complete\r\nopposability of the thumb, and the well developed brain, which enables\r\nhim fully to utilize these combined physical advantages. The monkeys\r\nhave none of these; and without them the amount of resemblance they have\r\nto us is no advantage, and confers no rank. We are biased by the too\r\nexclusive consideration of the man-like apes. If these did not exist\r\nthe remaining monkeys could not be thereby deteriorated as to their\r\norganization or lowered in their zoological position, but it is doubtful\r\nif we should then class them so high as we now do. We might then dwell\r\nmore on their resemblances to lower types--to rodents, to insectivora,\r\nand to marsupials, and should hardly rank the hideous baboon above the\r\ngraceful leopard or stately stag. The true conclusion appears to be,\r\nthat the combination of external characters and internal structure which\r\nexists in the monkeys, is that which, when greatly improved, refined,\r\nand beautified, was best calculated to become the perfect instrument\r\nof the human intellect and to aid in the development of man's higher\r\nnature; while, on the other hand, in the rude, inharmonious, and\r\nundeveloped state which it has reached in the quadrumana, it is by no\r\nmeans worthy of the highest place, or can be held to exhibit the most\r\nperfect development of existing animal life.--_Contemporary Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILK-PRODUCING BOMBYCES AND OTHER LEPIDOPTERA REARED IN 1881.\r\n\r\nBy ALFRED WAILLY, Membre Lauréat de la Société d'Acclimatation de\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy referring to my reports for the years 1879 and 1880, which appeared\r\nin the _Journal of the Society of Arts_, February 13 and March 5, 1880,\r\nFebruary 25 and March 4, 1881, it will be seen that the bad weather\r\nprevented the successful rearing in the open air of most species of\r\nsilk-producing larvæ. In 1881, the weather was extremely favorable up\r\nto the end of July, but the incessant and heavy rains of the month of\r\nAugust and beginning of September, proved fatal to most of the larvæ\r\nwhen they were in their last stages. However, in spite of my many\r\ndifficulties, I had the satisfaction of seeing them to their last\r\nstage. Larvæ of all the silk-producing bombyces were preserved in their\r\ndifferent stages, and can be seen in the Bethnal-green Museum. In July,\r\nwhen the weather was magnificent, the little trees in my garden were\r\nliterally covered with larvæ of more species than I ever had before, and\r\ntwo or three more weeks of fair weather would have given me a good crop\r\nof cocoons, instead of which I only obtained a very small number. The\r\nsparrows, as usual, also destroyed a quantity of worms, in spite of wire\r\nor fish-netting placed over some of the trees.\r\n\r\nOn the trees were to be seen--_Attacus cynthia_ (the Ailantus silkworm),\r\nthe rearing of which was, as usual, most successful; _Samia cecropia_\r\nand _Samia gloveri_, from America; also hybrids of _Gloveri cecropia_\r\nand _Cecropia gloveri_; _Samia promethea_ and _Telea polyphemus_;\r\n_Attacus pernyi_, and a new hybrid, which I obtained this last season by\r\nthe crossing of Pernyi with Royle. For the first time I reared _Actias\r\nselene_, from India, on a nut-tree in the garden, and _Attacus atlas_,\r\non the ailantus. The _Selene_ larvæ reached their fifth and last stage.\r\nThe Atlas larvæ only reached the third stage, and were destroyed by the\r\nheavy rains; only two remained on the tree till about the 8th or 9th of\r\nSeptember, when they had to be removed. I shall now reproduce the notes\r\nI took on some of the various species I reared.\r\n\r\n_Actias Selene_.--With sixty cocoons I only obtained one pairing. The\r\nmoths emerged from the beginning of March till the 13th of August,\r\nat intervals of some duration, or in batches of males or females. I\r\nobtained a pairing of Selene on the 30toh of June, 1881, and the worms\r\ncommenced to hatch on the 13th of July. The larvæ in first stage are of\r\na fine brown-red, with a broad black band in the middle of the body. The\r\nsecond stage commenced on the 20th of July; larvæ, of a lighter reddish\r\ncolor, without the black band; tubercles black. Third stage commenced on\r\nthe 28th of July; larvæ green; the first four tubercles yellow, with a\r\nblack ring at the base; other tubercles, orange yellow. Fourth stage\r\ncommenced on the 6th of August; larvæ green; first four tubercles\r\ngolden-yellow, the others orange-red. Fifth stage commenced on the 19th\r\nof August; first four tubercles yellow, with a black ring at the base;\r\nother tubercles yellow, slightly tinged with orange-red; lateral band\r\nbrown and greenish yellow; head and forelegs dark-brown. As stated\r\nbefore, the larvæ were reared on a nut-tree in the garden, till the last\r\nstage. Selene feeds on various trees--walnut, wild cherry, wild pear,\r\netc. In Ceylon (at Kandy), it is found on the wild olive tree. As far as\r\nI am informed by correspondents in Ceylon, this species is not found--or\r\nis seldom found--on the coasts, but _Attacus atlas_ and Mylitta are\r\ncommonly found there.\r\n\r\n_Attacus (antheroea) roylei_ (with sixty cocoons); three pairings only\r\nwere obtained, and this species I found the most difficult to pair in\r\ncaptivity. Two moths emerged on the 5th of March, a male and a female,\r\nand a pairing was obtained; but the weather being then too cold, the ova\r\nwere not fertile, the female moth, after laying about two hundred eggs,\r\nlived till the 22d of March, which is a very long time; this was owing\r\nto the low temperature. The moths emerged afterward from the 8th of\r\nApril till the 25th of June. A pairing took place on the 2d of June, and\r\nanother on the 6th of June.\r\n\r\nRoylei (the Himalaya oak silkworm) is very closely allied to Pernyi, the\r\nChinese oak silkworm; the Roylei moths are of a lighter color, but the\r\nlarvæ of both species can hardly be distinguished from one another.\r\nThe principal difference between the two species is in the cocoon. The\r\nRoylei cocoon is within a very large and tough envelope, while that of\r\nPernyi has no outer envelope at all. The larvæ of Roylei I reared did\r\nnot thrive, and the small number I had only went to the fourth stage,\r\nowing to several causes. I bred them under glass, in a green-house. A\r\ncertain number of the larvæ were unable to cut the shell of the egg.\r\n\r\nHere are a few notes I find in my book: Ova of Roylei commenced to hatch\r\non the 29th of June; second stage commenced on the 9th of July. The\r\nlarvæ in the first two stages seemed to me similar to those of Pernyi,\r\nas far as I could see. In second stage, the tubercles were of a\r\nbrilliant orange-red; on anal segment, blue dot on each side. Third\r\nstage, four rows of orange-yellow tubercles, two blue dots on anal\r\nsegment, brilliant gold metallic spots at the base of the tubercles on\r\nthe back, and silver metallic spots at the base of the tubercles on the\r\nsides. No further notes taken.\r\n\r\nOne of my correspondents in Vienna (Austria) obtained a remarkable\r\nsuccess in the rearing of Roylei. From the twenty-five eggs he had\r\ntwenty-three larvæ hatched, which produced twenty-three fine cocoons.\r\nThe same correspondent, with thirty-five eggs of _Samia gloveri_,\r\nobtained twenty cocoons. My other correspondents did not obtain any\r\nsuccess in rearing these two species, as far as I know.\r\n\r\n_Hybrid Roylei-Pernyi_.--I have said that it is extremely difficult to\r\nobtain the pairing of Roylei moths in captivity. But the male Pernyi\r\npaired readily with the female Roylei. I obtained six such pairings, and\r\na large quantity of fertile ova. The pairings of Roylei (female) with\r\nPernyi (male) took place as follows: two on the 21st of May, one on the\r\n3d of June, two on the 4th of June, and one on the 6th.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of this new hybrid, _Roylei-Pernyi_, contrary to what might\r\nhave been expected, were much easier to rear than those of Roylei, and\r\nthe cocoons obtained are far superior to those of Roylei, in size,\r\nweight, and richness of silk. The cocoon of my new hybrid has, like\r\nRoylei, an envelope, but there is no space between this envelope and the\r\ntrue cocoon inside. Therefore, this time, the crossing of two different\r\nspecies (but, it must be added, two very closely allied species) has\r\nproduced a hybrid very superior, at least to one of the types, that of\r\nRoylei. The cocoons of the hybrid _Roylei-Pernyi_ seem to me larger and\r\nheavier than any Pernyi cocoons I have as yet seen.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of this new hybrid have been successfully reared in France,\r\nin Germany, in Austria, and in the United States of North America. The\r\ncocoons obtained by Herr L. Huessman, one of my German correspondents,\r\nare remarkable for their size and beauty. The silk is silvery white.\r\n\r\nI have seventeen cocoons of this hybrid species, which number may be\r\nsufficient for its reproduction. But the question arises, \"Will the\r\nmoths obtained from these cocoons be susceptible of reproduction?\"\r\n\r\nIn my report on Lepidoptera for the year 1879, I stated, with respect to\r\nhybrids and degeneracy, that hybrids had been obtained by the crossing\r\nof _Attacus pernyi_ and _Attacus yama-maï_, but that, although the moths\r\n(some of which may be seen in the Bethnal-green Museum) are large and\r\napparently perfect in every respect, yet these hybrids could not be\r\nreproduced. It must be stated that these two species differ essentially\r\nin one particular point. _Yama-maï_ hibernates in the _ovum_ state,\r\nwhile Pernyi hibernates in the _pupa_ state. The hybrids hibernated in\r\nthe _pupa_ state. Roylei, as Pernyi, hibernates in the _pupa_ state.\r\n\r\nIn the November number, 1881, of \"The Entomologist,\" Mr. W.F. Kirby,\r\nof the British Museum, wrote an article having for its title,\r\n\"Hermaphrodite-hybrid Sphingidæ,\" in which, referring to hybrids of\r\n_Smerinthus ocellatus_ and _populi_, he says that hermaphroditism is the\r\nusual character of such hybrids.\r\n\r\nI extract the following passage from his article: \"I was under the\r\nimpression that hermaphroditism was the usual character of these\r\nhybrids; and it has suggested itself to my mind as a possibility, which\r\nI have not, at present, sufficient data either to prove or to disprove,\r\nthat the sterility of hybrids in general (still a somewhat obscure\r\nsubject) may perhaps be partly due to hybridism having a tendency to\r\nproduce hermaphroditism.\"\r\n\r\nNow, will the moths of new hybrid Roylei pernyi (which I expect will\r\nemerge in May or June, 1882) have the same tendency to hermaphroditism\r\nas has been observed with the hybrids obtained by the crossing of\r\n_Smerinthus populi_ with _Sm. ocellatus_? I do not think that such will\r\nbe the case with the moths of the hybrid Roylei-pernyi, on account of\r\nthe close relationship of Roylei with Pernyi, but nothing certain can be\r\nknown till the moths have emerged. Here are the few notes taken on the\r\nhybrid Roylei-pernyi: Ova commenced to hatch on the 12th of June; these\r\nwere from the pairing which had taken place on the 21st of May. Larvæ,\r\nblack, with long white hairs. Second stage commenced on the 21st of\r\nJune. Larva, of a beautiful green; tubercles orange-yellow; head dark\r\nbrown. Third stage commenced on the 1st of July; fourth stage on the\r\n7th. Larva of same color in those stages; tubercles on the back,\r\nviolet-blue or mauve; tubercles on the sides, blue. Fifth stage\r\ncommenced on the 18th of July. Larva, with tubercles on back and sides,\r\nblue, or violet-blue. First cocoon commenced on the 10th of August. Want\r\nof time prevented me from taking fuller and more accurate notes.\r\n\r\n_Attacus Atlas_.--For the first time, as stated before, I attempted the\r\nrearing of a small number of Atlas larvæ in the open air on the ailantus\r\ntree, but had to remove the last two remaining larvæ in September; the\r\nothers had all disappeared in consequence of the heavy and incessant\r\nrains. These larvæ were from eggs sent to me by one of my German\r\ncorrespondents. The pairing of the moths had taken place on the 17th of\r\nJuly, and the eggs had commenced to hatch on the 4th of August.\r\n\r\nI had about eighty cocoons of another and larger race of Atlas imported\r\nfrom the Province of Kumaon, but only eight moths emerged at intervals\r\nfrom the 31st of July to the 30th of September. Not only did the moths\r\nemerge too late in the season, but there never was a chance of obtaining\r\na pairing. In my report on Indian silkworms, published in the November\r\nnumber of the \"Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation,\" for the year\r\n1881, compiled from the work of Mr. J. Geoghegan, I reproduce the first\r\nappendix of Captain Thomas Hutton to Mr. Geoghegan's work, in which are\r\ngiven the names of all the Indian silkworms known by him up to the year\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nOf _Attacus atlas_, Captain Hutton says: \"It is common at 5,500 feet at\r\nMussoorie, and in the Dehra Doon; it is also found in some of the deep\r\nwarm glens of the outer hills. It is also common at Almorah, where the\r\nlarva feeds almost exclusively upon the 'Kilmorah' bush or _Berberis\r\nasiatica_; while at Mussoorie it will not touch that plant, but feeds\r\nexclusively upon the large milky leaves of _Falconeria insignis_.\r\nThe worm is, perhaps, more easily reared than any other of the wild\r\nbombycidæ.\"\r\n\r\nI will now quote from letters received from one of my correspondents in\r\nCeylon, a gentleman of great experience and knowledge in sericulture.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 24th August, 1881, my correspondent says: \"The Atlas\r\nmoth seems to be a near relation of the Cynthia, and would probably feed\r\non the Ailantus. Here it feeds on the cinnamon and a great number of\r\nother trees of widely different species; but the tree on which I\r\nhave kept it most successfully in a domestic state is the _Milnea\r\nroxburghiana_, a handsome tree, with dark-green ternate leaves, which\r\nkeep fresh long after being detached from the tree. I do not think the\r\ncocoon can ever be reeled, as the thread usually breaks when it comes\r\nto the open end. I have tried to reel a great many Atlas cocoons, but\r\nalways found the process too tedious and troublesome for practical use.\r\n\r\n\"The Mylitta (Tusser) is a more hardy species than the Atlas, and I have\r\nhad no difficulty in domesticating it. Here it feeds on the cashew-nut\r\ntree, on the so-called almond of this country (_Terminalia catappa_),\r\nwhich is a large tree entirely different from the European almond, and\r\non many other trees. Most of the trees whose leaves turn red when about\r\nto fall seem to suit it, but it is not confined to these. In the case of\r\nthe Atlas moth, I discovered one thing which may be well worth knowing,\r\nand that was, that with cocoons brought to the seaside after the larvæ\r\nhad been reared in the Central Provinces, in a temperature ten or twelve\r\ndegrees colder, the moths emerged in from ten to twenty days after the\r\nformation of the cocoon. The duration of the _pupa_ stage in this, and\r\nprobably in other species, therefore, depends upon the temperature in\r\nwhich the larvæ have lived, as well as the degree of heat in which the\r\ncocoons are kept; and in transporting cocoons from India to Europe, I\r\nthink it will be found that the moths are less liable to be prematurely\r\nforced out by the heat of the Red Sea when the larvæ have been reared in\r\na warm climate than when they have been reared in a cold one.\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree with the opinion expressed in one of your reports, that\r\nthe short duration of the larva stage, caused by a high temperature, has\r\nthe effect of diminishing the size of the cocoons, because the Atlas\r\nand Tusser cocoons produced at the sea-level here are quite as large as\r\nthose found in the Central Provinces at elevations of three thousand\r\nfeet or more. According to the treatise on the \"Silk Manufacture,\" in\r\n\"Lardner's Cyclopedia,\" the Chinese are of opinion that one drachm\r\nof mulberry silkworms' eggs will produce 25 ounces of silk if the\r\ncaterpillars attain maturity within twenty-five days; 20 ounces if the\r\ncommencement of the cocoons be delayed until the twenty-eighth day; and\r\nonly 10 ounces if it be delayed until between the thirtieth and fortieth\r\nday. If this is correct, a short-lived larva stage must, instead of\r\ncausing small cocoons, produce just the contrary effect.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated November 25, 1881, my correspondent says: \"I am\r\nsorry that you have not had better success in the rearing of your\r\nlarvæ, but you should not despair. It is possible that the choice of an\r\nimproper food-plant may have as much to do with failures as the coldness\r\nand dampness of the English climate. I lost many thousands of Atlas\r\ncaterpillars before I found out the proper tree to keep them on in a\r\ndomesticated state; and when I did attain partial success, I could\r\nnot keep them for more than one generation, till I found the _Milnea\r\nroxburghiana_ to be their proper food plant. I do not know the proper\r\nfood-plant of the Mylitta (Tusser), but I have succeeded very well with\r\nit, as it is a more hardy species than the Atlas. Though a Bombyx be\r\npolyphagous in a state of nature, yet I think most species have a tree\r\nproper to themselves, on which they are more at home than on any\r\nother plant. I should like, if you could find out from some your\r\ncorrespondents in India, on what species of tree Mylitta cocoons are\r\nfound in the largest numbers, and what is about the greatest number\r\nfound on a single tree. The Mylitta is common enough here, but there\r\ndoes not seem to be any kind of tree here on which the cocoons are to be\r\nfound in greater numbers than twos and threes; and there must be some\r\ntree in India on which the cocoons are to be found in much greater\r\nplenty, because they could not otherwise be collected in sufficient\r\nquantity for manufacturing purposes. The Atlas is here found on twenty\r\nor more different kinds of trees, but a hundred or a hundred and fifty\r\ncocoons or larvæ may be found on a single tree of _Milnea roxburghiana_,\r\nwhile they are to be found only singly, or in twos and threes, on any\r\nother tree that I know of. The Atlas and Mylitta seem to be respectively\r\nthe Indian relations of the Cynthia and Pernyi. It is, therefore,\r\nprobable that the Ailantus would be the most suitable European tree for\r\nthe Atlas, and the oak for the Mylitta.\"\r\n\r\n_Attacus mylitta_ (_Antheræa paphia_).--I did not receive a single\r\ncocoon of this species for the season 1881. My stock consisted of seven\r\ncocoons, from the lot received from Calcutta at the end of February,\r\n1880. Five were female, and two male cocoons; one of the latter died,\r\nthus reducing the number to six. The moths emerged as follows: One\r\nfemale on the 21st of June, one female on the 26th, one female on the\r\n28th, one female on the 1st of July, and one male on the 3d of August;\r\nthe latter emerging thirty-four days too late to be of any use for\r\nrearing purposes. The last female moth emerged, I think, about the end\r\nof September. These cocoons had hibernated twice, as has been the case\r\nwith other Indian species. I had Indian cocoons which hibernated even\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\n_Attacus cynthia_, from the province of Kumaon.--With the Atlas cocoons,\r\na large quantity of Cynthia cocoons were collected in the province\r\nof Kumaon. Both species had, no doubt, fed on the same trees; as the\r\nCynthia, like the Atlas cocoons, were all inclosed in leaves of the\r\n_Berberis vulgaris_, which shows that Cynthia is also a polyphagous\r\nspecies. It is already known that it feeds on several species of trees,\r\nbesides the ailantus, such as the laburnum, lilac, cherry, and, I think,\r\nalso on the castor-oil plant; the common barberry has, therefore, to be\r\nadded to the above food plants.\r\n\r\nThese Kumaon Cynthia cocoons were somewhat smaller and much darker in\r\ncolor than those of the acclimatized Cynthia reared on the ailantus. The\r\nmoths of this wild Indian Cynthia were also of a richer color than those\r\nof the cultivated species in Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer 1881, I saw cocoons of my own Cynthia race obtained\r\nfrom worms which had been reared on the laburnum tree. These cocoons\r\nwere, as far as I can remember, of a yellowish or saffron color; which\r\nI had never seen before. This difference in the color of the cocoon was\r\nvery likely produced by the change of food, although it has been stated,\r\nand I think it may be quite correct, that with many species of native\r\nlepidoptera the change of food-plants does not produce any difference of\r\ncolor in the insects obtained. With respect to the Cynthia worms reared\r\non the laburnum instead of the ailantus, it may be that the moths, which\r\nwill emerge from the yellow cocoons, will be similar to those obtained\r\nfrom cocoons spun by worms bred on the ailantus, and that the only\r\ndifference will be in the color of the cocoons.\r\n\r\nThe Kumaon Cynthia cocoons, as I found it to be the case with Indian\r\nspecies introduced for the first time into Europe, did not produce moths\r\nat the same time, nor as regularly as the acclimatized species. The\r\nmoths emerged as follows: One female on the 22d of July; one female on\r\nthe 25th; one male on the 3d August; one female on the 19th; one male on\r\nthe 28th of August; one male on the 2d September; one female on the 3d.\r\nA pairing was obtained with the latter two. Two males emerged on the 4th\r\nof September; one male on the 6th; one male and one female on the 22d;\r\none female on the 23d; and one female on the 25th of September. Five\r\ncocoons, which did not produce any moths, contain pupæ, which are still\r\nin perfect condition; and the moths will no doubt emerge next summer\r\n(1882). As seen in my note, a pairing of this wild Indian Cynthia took\r\nplace; this was from the evening of the 4th to the 5th of September. The\r\neggs laid by the female moth were deposited in a most curious way, in\r\nsmaller or larger quantities, but all forming perfect triangles. These\r\neggs I gave to a florist who has been very successful in the rearing\r\nof silk-producing and other larvæ; telling him to rear the Cynthia on\r\nlilacs grown in pots and placed in a hot-house, which was done. The\r\nworms, which hatched in a few days, as they were placed in a hot-house,\r\nthrived wonderfully well, and I might say they thrived too well, as they\r\ngrew so fast and became so voracious that the growth of the lilac trees\r\ncould not keep pace with the growth of the worms. These, at the fourth\r\nstage, became so large that the foliage was entirely devoured, and, of\r\ncourse, the consequence was that all the worms were starved. I only\r\nheard of the result of that experiment long after the death of the\r\nlarvæ; otherwise I should have suggested the use of another plant after\r\nthe destruction of the foliage of the lilacs; the privet (_Ligustrum\r\nvulgare_) might have been tried, and success obtained with it.\r\n\r\nOf such species as _Attacus pyri_, of Central Europe, and _Attacus\r\npernyi_, the North Chinese oak silkworm, which I have mentioned in my\r\nprevious reports, and bred every season for several years, I shall only\r\nsay that I never could rear Pyri in the open air in London, up to the\r\nformation of the cocoon. As to Pernyi, I had, in 1881, an immense\r\nquantity of splendid moths, from which I obtained the largest quantity\r\nof ova I ever had of this species. I had many thousands of fertile ova\r\nof Pernyi, which I was unable to distribute. Many schoolboys reared\r\nPernyi worms, but with what success I do not yet know. The number of\r\nfertile ova obtained from Pyri moths was also more considerable than in\r\nformer years, which was due partly to the good quality of the pupæ, and\r\npartly to the very favorable weather in June, at the time the pairings\r\nof the moths took place.\r\n\r\nLeaving these, I now come to the North American species.\r\n\r\n_Telea polyphemus_.--As I have stated in former years, this is the best\r\nNorth American silkworm, producing a closed cocoon, somewhat smaller\r\nthan that of Pernyi, but the silk seems as good as that of Pernyi.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons of Polyphemus I had in 1881 were smaller and inferior in\r\nquality to those I had before. Those received in 1878 and 1879 were\r\nconsiderably finer and larger than those which were sent in 1880 and\r\n1881; besides, they were sent in much larger quantities. The cocoons\r\nreceived this year (1882) are finer than those of 1881, but yet they\r\ncannot be compared with those of 1878 and 1879.\r\n\r\nWith about sixty cocoons of _Telea polyphemus_ I only obtained three\r\npairings, which I attribute solely to the weakness of the moths, as\r\nthe weather was all that could be desired for the pairings. The moths\r\nemerged from the 1st of June to the 20th of July. One male moth emerged\r\non the 7th September. This latter was one from a small number of cocoons\r\nreceived from Alabama; the other cocoons of the same race had emerged at\r\nthe same time as the cocoons from the Northern States. In the Northern\r\nStates the species is single-brooded; in the Southern States it is\r\ndouble-brooded.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of Polyphemus can be bred in the open air in England, almost\r\nas easily as those of Pernyi, and even Cynthia; they will pass through\r\ntheir five stages and spin their cocoons on the trees, unless the\r\nweather should be unexceptionally cold and wet, as was the case during\r\nthe month of August, 1881, when the larvæ had reached their full size;\r\nthey were reared this year on the nut-tree, and some on the oak. The\r\nspecies is extremely polyphagous, and will feed well on oak, birch,\r\nchestnut, beech, willow, nut, etc.\r\n\r\nThe moth of Polyphemus is very beautiful, and, as in some other species,\r\nvaries in its shades of color. The larva is of a transparent green, of\r\nextreme beauty; the head is light brown; without any black dots, as in\r\nPernyi; the spines are pink, and at the base of each of them there is a\r\nbrilliant metallic spot. When the sun shines on them the larvæ seem to\r\nbe covered with diamonds. These metallic spots at the base of the spines\r\nare also seen on Pernyi, Yama mai, Mylitta, and other species of the\r\ngenus Antheræa, all having a closed cocoon, but none of these have so\r\nmany as Polyphemus.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons of the species of the genus Actias are closed, but the larvæ\r\nhave not the metallic spots of the species of the genus Antheræa.\r\n\r\n_Samia Gloveri_.--Three North American silk-producing bombyces, very\r\nclosely allied, have been mentioned in my previous reports; they are;\r\n_Samia ceanothi_, from California; _Samia gloveri_, from Utah and\r\nArizona; and _Samia cecropia_, commonly found in most of the Northern\r\nStates--the latter is the best and largest silk producer. Crossings of\r\nthese species took places in 1880, and, as I stated before, the ova\r\nobtained from a long pairing between a Ceanothi female with a Gloveri\r\nmale, were the only ones which were fertile. The Gloveri cocoons\r\nreceived in 1880 were of a very inferior quality, and produced moths\r\nfrom which no pairings could be obtained, although some crossings took\r\nplace. In 1881, the Gloveri cocoons, on the contrary, produced fine,\r\nhealthy moths; yet only five pairings could be obtained, with about one\r\nhundred cocoons. Besides these five pairings, a quantity of fertile\r\nova were obtained by the crossings of _S. gloveri_ (female) with _S.\r\ncecropia_ (male), and Cecropia (female) with Gloveri (male). No success,\r\nso far as I know, was obtained with the rearing of the hybrid larvæ; the\r\nrearings of the larvæ of pure Gloveri were also, I think, a failure,\r\nonly one correspondent having been successful; but some correspondents\r\nhave not yet made the result of their experiments known to me. The larvæ\r\nof _Samia cecropia, S. gloveri_, and _S. ceanothi_, are very much alike;\r\nand hardly any difference can be observed in the first two stages. In\r\nthe third and fourth stages, the larvæ of _S. cecropia_ and _S. gloveri_\r\nare also nearly alike; the principal difference between these two\r\nspecies and _S. cecropia_ being that the tubercles on the back are of a\r\nuniform color--orange-red, or yellow--while on Cecropia the first four\r\ndorsal tubercles are red, and the rest yellow. The tubercles on the\r\nsides are blue on the three species.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the hybrids _Gloveri-cecropia_ were, as far as I could\r\nobserve, like those of Cecropia, but I noticed some with six red\r\ntubercles on the back instead of four, as on Cecropia. They were reared\r\non plum, apple, and _Salix caprea_; in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of _Samia gloveri_ were reared, during the first four stages\r\non a wild plum-tree, then on _Salix, caprea_, and I reproduce the notes\r\ntaken on this species, which I bred this year (1881) for the first time.\r\n\r\nGloveri moths emerged from the 15th of May to the end of June; five\r\npairings took place as follows: 1st, 4th, 9th, 24th, and 26th of June.\r\nFirst stage--larvæ quite black. Second stage--larvæ orange, with black\r\nspines. Third stage--dorsal spines, orange-red; spines on sides blue.\r\nFourth stage--dorsal spines, orange or yellow, spines on the sides blue;\r\nbody light blue on the back, and greenish yellow on the sides; head,\r\ngreen; legs, yellow. Fifth and sixth stage--larvæ nearly the same;\r\ntubercles on the back yellow, the first four having a black ring at the\r\nbase; side tubercles ivory-white, with a dark-blue base.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned American species, like most other silk-producing\r\nbombyces, were bred in the open air; but besides these, I reared three\r\nother species of American bombyces in the house, under glass, and with\r\nthe greatest success. These are: _Hyperchiria io_, a beautiful species\r\nmentioned in my report for the year 1879; _Orgyia leucostigma_, from ova\r\nreceived on December 29, 1880, from Madison, Wis., which hatched on the\r\n27th of May, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe third American species reared under glass is the following very\r\ninteresting bombyx: _Ceratocampa (Eacles) imperialis_. The pupæ of\r\nthis species are rough, and armed with small, sharp points at all the\r\nsegments; the last segment having a thick, straight, and bifid tail. The\r\nmoths, which measure from four to about six inches in expanse of wings,\r\nare bright yellow, with large patches and round spots of reddish-brown,\r\nwith a purple gloss; besides these patches and round spots, the wings\r\nare covered with small dark dots. The male moth is much more blotched\r\nthan the female, and although of a smaller size, is much more showy than\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\nWith twenty-four pupæ of Imperialis I obtained nineteen moths from the\r\n21st of June to the 19th of July; five pupæ died. Two pairings took\r\nplace; the first from the evening of the 13th to the morning of the\r\n14th; the second from the evening of the 15th to the morning of the 16th\r\nof July.\r\n\r\nThe ova, which are about the size of those of Yama-mai, Pernyi, or\r\nMylitta, are rather flat and concave on one side, of an amber-yellow\r\ncolor and transparent, like those of sphingidæ. When the larvæ have\r\nabsorbed the yellow liquid in the egg, and are fully developed; they can\r\nbe seen through the shell of the egg, which is white or colorless when\r\nthe larva has come out.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of Imperialis, which have six stages, commenced to hatch on\r\nthe 31st of July; the second stage commenced on the 7th of August; the\r\nthird, on the 17th; the fourth, on the 29th of August; the fifth, on\r\nthe 18th of September; and the sixth, on the 1st of October. The larvæ\r\ncommenced to pupate on 13th of October.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of this curious species vary considerably in color. Some are\r\nof a yellowish color, others are brown and tawny, others are black or\r\nnearly black. My correspondent in Georgia, who bred this species the\r\nsame season as I did, in 1881, had some of the larvæ that were green. In\r\nall the stages the larvæ have five conspicuous spines or horns; two on\r\nthe third segment, two on the fourth, and one on the last segment but\r\none; this is taking the head as the first segment with regard to the\r\nfirst four spines These spines are rough and covered with sharp points\r\nall round, and their extremities are fork-like. In the first three\r\nstages they are horny; in the last three stages these spines are fleshy,\r\nand much shorter in proportion than they are in the first three\r\nstages. The color of the spines in the last three stages is coral-red,\r\nyellowish, or black. In the fifth and sixth stages the spine on the last\r\nsegment but one is very short.\r\n\r\nHere are a few and short notes from my book:\r\n\r\n1st stage. Larvæ, about one-third of an inch; head, brown, shiny, and\r\nglobulous.\r\n\r\n2d stage. Larvæ, dark-brown, almost black; spines, white at the base,\r\nand black at the extremities; head shiny and light brown.\r\n\r\n3d stage. Larve, fine black; head black; white hairs on the back;\r\nspines, whitish, buff, or yellowish at the base, and black at the\r\nextremities; other larvæ of a brown color.\r\n\r\n4th stage. Larvæ, black granulated with white; long white hairs; horns,\r\nbrown-orange with white tips; on each segment two brown spots. Spiracles\r\nwell marked with outer circle, brown, then black; white and black dot in\r\nthe center. Anal segment with brown ribs, the intervals black with white\r\ndots; head shining, black with two brown bands on the face, forming a\r\ntriangle. Other larvæ in fourth stage, velvety black, with coral-red\r\nspines; others with black spines.\r\n\r\n5th stage. Larvæ, entirely black, with showy eye-like spiracles,\r\npolished black head; other larvæ having the head brown and black. Larvæ\r\ncovered with long white hair; spines black or red. No difference noticed\r\nbetween the fifth and sixth stages.\r\n\r\nOne larva on fourth stage was different from all others, and was\r\ndescribed at the British Museum by Mr. W. F. Kirby as follows: \"Larva\r\nreddish-brown, sparingly clothed with long slender white hairs, with\r\nfour reddish stripes on the face, two rows of red spots on the back,\r\nspiracles surrounded with yellow, black and red rings; legs red, prolegs\r\nblack, spotted with red. On segments three and four are four long\r\ncoral-red fleshy-branched spines, two on each segment, below which, on\r\neach side, are two rudimentary ones just behind the head; in front of\r\nsegment two are four similar rudimentary orange spines or tubercles;\r\nlast segment black, strongly granulated and edges triangularly above and\r\nat the sides, with coral-red; several short rudimentary fleshy spines\r\nrising from the red portion; the last segment but one is reddish above,\r\nwith a short red spine in the middle, and the one before it has a long\r\ncoral-red spine in the middle similar to those of segments three and\r\nfour, but shorter\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as my Imperialis larvæ had hatched, I gave them various kinds of\r\nfoliage, plane-tree, oak, pine, sallow, etc. At first they did not touch\r\nany kind of foliage, or they did not seem to touch any; and I was afraid\r\nI should be unable to rear them; but on the second or third day of their\r\nexistence, they made up their minds and decided upon eating the foliage\r\nof some of the European trees I had offered them. They attacked oak,\r\nsallow, and pine, but did not touch the plane-tree leaves. In America,\r\nthe larvæ of Imperialis feed on button-wood, which is the American\r\nplane-tree (_Platanus occidentalis_), yet they did not take to _Platanus\r\norientalis_. After a little time I reduced the foliage to oak and sallow\r\nbranches, and ultimately gave them the sallow (_Salix caprea_) only, on\r\nwhich they thrived very well. I was pleased with this success; as I had\r\npreviously read in a volume of the \"Naturalist's Library\" a description\r\nof _Ceratocampa imperialis_, which ends as follows: \"The caterpillars\r\nare not common, and are the most difficult to bring to perfection in\r\nconfinement, as they will not eat in that situation; and, even if they\r\nchange into a chrysalis, they die afterward.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I finish with _C. imperialis_, I must mention a peculiar fact.\r\nDuring the first stage, and, I think, also during the second, several\r\nlarvæ disappeared without leaving any traces. I also saw two smaller\r\nlarvæ held tight by the hind claspers of two larger ones. The larvæ thus\r\nheld and pressed were perfectly dead when I observed them, and I removed\r\nthem. My impression then was that these larvae were carnivorous, not\r\nfrom this last fact alone, as I had previously observed it with larvæ\r\nof Catocalæ when they are too crowded, but from the fact that some had\r\ndisappeared entirely from the glass under which they were confined. I\r\nbegan to reduce their numbers, and put six only under each glass, so as\r\nto be able to watch them better. Whether I had made a mistake or not\r\npreviously to this I do not exactly know; but from this moment the\r\nlarvae behaved in a most exemplary manner, especially when they became\r\nlarger. They crawled over each other's backs without the least sign of\r\nspite or animosity, even when they were in sleep, in which case larvæ\r\nare generally very sensitive and irritable, all were of a most pacific\r\nnature. It is, therefore, with the greatest pleasure that, for want of\r\nsufficient evidence, I withdraw this serious charge of cannibalism which\r\nI first intended to bring against them.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said respecting the rearing of exotic silk-producing\r\nbombyces, especially tropical species, it must have been observed\r\nthat several difficulties, standing in the way of success, have to be\r\novercome. The moths of North American species emerge regularly enough\r\nduring the months of May, June, or July, but Indian and other tropical\r\nspecies may emerge at any time of the year, if the weather is mild, as\r\nhas been the case during this unusually mild winter of 1881-1882. From\r\nthe end of December to the present time (March 14, 1882) moths of four\r\nspecies of Indian silk-producers, especially _Antheræa roylei_ and\r\n_Actias selene_, have constantly emerged, but only one or two at a time.\r\nThese moths emerged from cocoons received in December and January last.\r\n\r\nIt is only when these tropical species shall have been already reared in\r\nEurope that the emergence of the moths will be regular; then they will\r\nbe single-brooded in Northern or Central Europe, and some will very\r\nlikely become double-brooded in Southern Europe. But when just imported\r\nthe moths of these tropical species will always be uncertain and\r\nirregular in their emergence; hence the importance of having a\r\nsufficient number of cocoons so as to meet this difficulty, i.e., the\r\nloss of the moths that emerge prematurely or irregularly.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I shall repeat what I already stated in a previous\r\nreport, that the sending of live cocoons and pupæ from India and other\r\ndistant countries to Europe, can easily be done, so that they will\r\narrive alive and in good condition, if care be taken that the boxes\r\ncontaining these live cocoons and pupæ should not be left in the sun or\r\nnear a fire (which has been the case before), and that they should at\r\nonce be put in a cool place or in the ice-room of the steamer. The\r\ncocoons and pupæ should be sent from October to March or April,\r\naccording to distance, and it is most important to write on the cases,\r\n\"Living silkworm cocoons or pupæ, the case to be placed in the ice\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nBy taking this simple precaution, live cocoons and pupæ, when newly\r\nformed, can be safely sent from very distant countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo continue these interesting and useful studies, I shall always be glad\r\nto buy any number of live cocoons, or exchange them for other species,\r\nif preferable.\r\n\r\nALFRED WAILLY.\r\n\r\n110 Clapham Road, London, S.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSQUITO OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent from Sheepshead Bay, a place celebrated for the size of\r\nits mosquitoes and the number of its amateur fishermen, recommends the\r\nfollowing as a very good mixture for anointing the face and hands while\r\nfishing:\r\n\r\n  Oil of tar.           1 ounce.\r\n  Olive oil.            1 ounce.\r\n  Oil of pennyroyal.    ½ ounce.\r\n  Spirit of camphor.    ½ ounce.\r\n  Glycerine.            ½ ounce.\r\n  Carbolic acid.        2 drachms.\r\n\r\nMix.

The corner stone was laid\r\nJuly 20, A.D. 1221, by Fernando III., and his Queen Beatrice, assisted\r\nby Archbishop Mauricio. The world is indebted to Mauricio for the\r\nselection of the site, and for the general idea and planning of what he\r\nintended should be, and in fact now is, the finest temple of worship in\r\nthe world. This immense stone structure, embellished with airy columns,\r\npointed arches, statues, inscriptions, delicate crestings, and flanked\r\nby two needles or aerial arrows, rises toward the heavens, a sublime\r\ninvocation of Christian genius.\r\n\r\nIlluminated by the morning sun it appears, at a certain distance, as if\r\nthe pyramids were floating in space; further on is seen the marvelous\r\ndome of the transept, crowned with eight towers of chiseled lace-work,\r\nover the center of the church.\r\n\r\nPubic worship was held in a portion of the edifice nine years after the\r\nwork was begun; from that time onward for three hundred years, various\r\nadditional portions were completed. On March 4, 1539, the great\r\ntransept, built fifty years previous, fell down; but was soon restored.\r\nAugust 16, 1642, at 6½ o'clock, P.M., a furious hurricane overthrew the\r\neight little towers that form the exterior corner of the dome; but in\r\ntwo years they were replaced, namely July 19, 1644: the same night the\r\ngreat bells sounded an alarm of fire, the transept having in some way\r\nbecome ignited. The activity of the populace, however, prevented the\r\nloss of the edifice, which for a time was in great danger.\r\n\r\nThe first architect publicly mentioned in the archives of the edifice\r\nwas the Master Enrique. He also directed the work of the Cathedral of\r\nLeon. He died July 10, 1277. The second architect was Juan Perez, who\r\ndied in 1296, and was buried in the cloister, under the cathedral. He is\r\nbelieved to have been either the son or brother of the celebrated Master\r\nPedro Perez, who designed the Cathedral of Toledo, and who died in 1299.\r\nThe third architect of the Cathedral of Burgos was Pedro Sanchez, who\r\ndirected the work in 1384; after him followed Juan Sanchez de Molina,\r\nMartin Fernandez, the three Colonias, Juan de Vallejo, Diego de Siloe,\r\nthe elder Nicolas de Vergara, Matienzo, Pieredonda, Gil, Regines, and\r\nothers. It is worthy of note that a number of Moorish architects were\r\nemployed on the work during the 14th and 15th centuries, such as\r\nMohomad, Yunce, the Master Hali, the Master Mahomet de Aranda, the\r\nMaster Yunza de Carrion, the Master Carpenter Brahen. Among the figure\r\nsculptors employed were Juan Sanchez de Fromesta, the Masters Gil and\r\nCopin, the famous Felipe de Vigardi, Juan de Lancre, Anton de Soto, Juan\r\nde Villareal, Pedro de Colindres, and many others.

As Professor T.E.\r\nNurse, of the U.S.N., says in his memoirs:\r\n\r\n\"This problem of interoceanic communication has been justly said to\r\npossess not only practical value, but historical grandeur. It clearly\r\nlinks itself back to the era of the conquest of Cortez, three and a half\r\ncenturies.\" [1] It is a problem which has been left for our modern era\r\nto solve, but nevertheless its history is thereby rendered still more\r\ninteresting, having needed so many centuries to bring it to an issue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From Prof. Nurse's historical essay. See Survey of\r\nNicaragua Canal, by Com. Lull.]\r\n\r\nSpain, which acquired through her Columbus a new empire, lying near, as\r\nit was supposed, to the riches of Asia, could not be indifferent, from\r\nthe moment of her discoveries, to the means of crossing these lands to\r\nyet richer ones beyond.\r\n\r\nIndia, from the days of Alexander and of the geographers, Mela, Strabo,\r\nand Ptolemy, was the land of promise, the home of the spices, the\r\ninexhaustible fountain of wealth. The old routes of commerce thither had\r\nbeen closed one by one to the Christians; the overland trade had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the Arabs; and at the fall of Constantinople, 1453,\r\nthe commerce of the Black Sea and of the Bosphorus, the last of the old\r\nroutes to the East, finally failed the Christian world. Yet even beyond\r\nthe fame of the East, which tradition had brought down from Greek and\r\nRoman, much more had the crusaders kindled for Asia (Cathay) and its\r\nriches an ardor not easily suppressed in men's minds.\r\n\r\nThe error of the Spanish Admiral in supposing that the eastern shores\r\nof Asia extended 240 degrees east of Spain, or to the meridian of\r\nthe modern San Diego, in California--this error, insisted on in his\r\ndispatches and adopted and continued by his followers, still further\r\nanimated the earlier Spanish sovereigns and the men whom they sent into\r\nthe New World to reach Asia by a short and easy route.\r\n\r\nNobody in Europe dreamt that Columbus had discovered a new continent,\r\nand when Balbao, in 1513, discovered the South Sea, then it was known\r\nthat Asia lay beyond, and navigators directed their course there. On\r\nhis deathbed, in 1506, Columbus still held to his delusion that he had\r\nreached Zipanga, Japan. In 1501 he was exploring the coast of Veragua,\r\nin Central America, still looking for the Ganges, and announcing his\r\nbeing informed on this coast of a sea which would bear ships to the\r\nmouth of that river, while about the same time the Cabots, under Henry\r\nVII., were taking possession of Newfoundland, believing it to be part of\r\nthe island coast of China.\r\n\r\nAlthough these were grave blunders in geography and in navigation, the\r\ndiscoveries really made in the rich tropical zones, the acquirement of\r\na new world, and the rich products continually reaching Europe from it,\r\nfor a time aroused Spain from her lethargy. The world opened east and\r\nwest. The new routes poured their spices, silks, and drugs through new\r\nchannels into all the Teutonic countries. The strong purposes of having\r\nnear access to the East were deepened and perpetuated doubly strong, by\r\nthe certainties before men's eyes of what had been attained.\r\n\r\nBalbao, in 1513, gained from a height on the Isthmus of Panama the first\r\nproof of its separation from Asia; and Magellan enters the South Sea\r\nat the southern extremity of the country, now first proven to be thus\r\nseparate and a continent. Men in those days began to think that creation\r\nwas doubled, and that such discovered lands must be separate from India,\r\nChina, and Japan. And the very successes of the Portuguese under Vasco\r\nda Gama, bringing from their eastern course the expectancy of Asia's\r\nwealth, intensely excited the Spaniards to renew their western search.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese, led around the Cape of Good Hope, had brought home vast\r\ntreasures from the East, while the Spanish discoverers, as yet, had not\r\nreached the countries either of Montezuma or of the Inca. Their success\r\n\"troubled the sleep of the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nEverything, then, of personal ambition and national pride, the thirst\r\nfor gold, the zeal of religious proselytism, and the cold calculations\r\nof state policy, now concurred in the disposition to sacrifice what\r\nSpain already had of most value on the American shores in order to seize\r\nupon a greater good, the Indies, still supposed to be near at hand. And\r\nsince it was now certain that the new lands were not themselves Asia,\r\nthe next aim was to find the secret of the narrow passage across\r\nthem which must lead thither. The very configuration of the isthmus\r\nstrengthened the belief in the existence of such a passage by the number\r\nof its openings, which seemed to invite entrance in the expectancy that\r\nsome one of them must extend across the narrow breadth of land.\r\n\r\nFor this the Spanish government, in 1514, gave secret orders to\r\nD'Avilla, Governor of Castila del Oro, and to Juan de Solis, the\r\nnavigator, to determine whether Castila del Oro were an island, and to\r\nsend to Cuba a chart of the coast, if any strait were possible. For\r\nthis, De Solis visited Nicaragua and Honduras; and later, led far to the\r\nsouth, perished in the La Plata. For this, Magellan entered the straits,\r\nwhich, strangely enough, he affirmed before setting out, that he \"would\r\nenter,\" since he \"had seen them marked out on the geographer Martin\r\nBehaim's globe.\" For this, Cortez sent out his expeditions on both\r\ncoasts, exposing his own life and treasure, and sending home to the\r\nemperor, in his second relation, a map of the entire Gulf of Mexico\r\n(Dispatch from Cortez to Charles V., October 15, 1524). For this great\r\npurpose, and in full expectancy of success in it, the whole coast of\r\nthe New World on each side, from Newfoundland on the northeast, curving\r\nwestward on the south, around the whole sweep of the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nthence to Magellan's Straits, and thence through them up the Pacific to\r\nthe Straits of Behring, was searched and researched with diligence.\r\n\"Men could not get accustomed,\" says Humboldt, \"to the idea that the\r\ncontinent extended uninterruptedly both so far north and south.\" Hence\r\nall these large, numerous, and persevering expeditions by the European\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAmong them, by priority of right and by her energy, was Spain. The great\r\nemperor was urgent on the conqueror of Mexico, and on all in subordinate\r\npositions in New Spain, to solve the secret of the strait. All Spain was\r\nawakened to it. \"How majestic and fair was she,\" says Chevalier, \"in the\r\nsixteenth century; what daring, what heroism and perseverance! Never had\r\nthe world seen such energy, activity, or good fortune. Hers was a will\r\nthat regarded no obstacles. Neither rivers, deserts, nor mountains far\r\nhigher than those in Europe, arrested her people. They built grand\r\ncities, they drew their fleets, as in a twinkling of the eye, from the\r\nvery forests. A handful of men conquered empires. They seemed a race of\r\ngiants or demi-gods. One would have supposed that all the work necessary\r\nto bind together climates and oceans would have been done at the word of\r\nthe Spaniards as by enchantment, and since nature had not left a passage\r\nthrough the center of America, no matter, so much the better for\r\nthe glory of the human race; they would make it up by artificial\r\ncommunication. What, indeed, was that for men like them? It were done\r\nat a word. Nothing else was left for them to conquer, and the world was\r\nbecoming too small for them.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly, had Spain remained what she then was, what had been in vain\r\nsought from nature would have been supplied by man. A canal or several\r\ncanals would have been built to take the place of the long-desired\r\nstrait. Her men of science urged it. In 1551, Gomara, the author of the\r\n\"History of the Indies,\" proposed the union of the oceans by three of\r\nthe very same lines toward which, to this hour, the eye turns with hope.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Gomara, \"that mountains obstruct these passes, but if\r\nthere are mountains there are also hands; let but the resolve be made,\r\nthere will be no want of means; the Indies, to which the passage will\r\nbe made, will supply them. To a king of Spain, with the wealth of the\r\nIndies at his command, when the object to be obtained is the spice\r\ntrade, what is possible is easy.\r\n\r\nBut the sacred fire suddenly burned itself out in Spain. The peninsula\r\nhad for its ruler a prince who sought his glory in smothering free\r\nthought among his own people, and in wasting his immense resources in\r\nvain efforts to repress it also outside of his own dominions through all\r\nEurope. From that hour, Spain became benumbed and estranged from all\r\nthe advances of science and art, by means of which other nations, and\r\nespecially England, developed their true greatness.\r\n\r\nEven after France had shown, by her canal of the south, that boats could\r\nascend and pass the mountain crests, it does not appear that the\r\nSpanish government seriously wished to avail itself of a like means of\r\nestablishing any communication between her sea of the Antilles and the\r\nSouth Sea. The mystery enveloping the deliberations of the council of\r\nthe Indies has not always remained so profound that we could not know\r\nwhat was going on in that body. The Spanish government afterward opened\r\nup to Humboldt free access to its archives, and in these he found\r\nseveral memoirs on the possibility of a union between the two oceans;\r\nbut he says that in no one of them did he find the main point, the\r\nheight of the elevations on the isthmus, sufficiently cleared up, and\r\nhe could not fail to remark that the memoirs were exclusively French or\r\nEnglish. Spain herself gave it no thought. Since the glorious age of\r\nBalbao among the people, indeed, the project of a canal was in every\r\none's thoughts. In the very wayside talks, in the inns of Spain, when a\r\ntraveler from the New World chanced to pass, after making him tell of\r\nthe wonders of Lima and Mexico, of the death of the Inca, Atahualpa,\r\nand the bloody defeat of the Aztecs, and after asking his opinion of El\r\nDorado, the question was always about the two oceans, and what great\r\nthings would happen if they could succeed in joining them.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Spain\r\nhad need of the best mode of conveyance for her treasures across the\r\nisthmus. Yet those from Peru came by the miserable route from Panama to\r\nthe deadliest of climates. Porto Bello and her European wares for\r\nher colonies toiled up the Chagres river, while the roughest of\r\ncommunication farther north connected the Chimalapa and the Guasacoalcos\r\nin Mexico, and the trade there was limited sternly to but one port on\r\neach side. As late as Humboldt's visit, in 1802, when remarking upon the\r\n\"unnatural modes of communication\" by which, through painful delays, the\r\nimmense treasures of the New World passed from Acapulco, Guayaquil,\r\nand Lima, to Spain, he says: \"These will soon cease whenever an active\r\ngovernment, willing to protect commerce, shall construct a good road\r\nfrom Panama to Porto Bello. The aristocratic nonchalance of Spain, and\r\nher fear to open to strangers the way to the countries explored for her\r\nown profit, only kept those countries closed.\" The court forbade, on\r\npain of death, the use of plans at different times proposed. They\r\nwronged their own colonies by representing the coasts as dangerous and\r\nthe rivers impassable. On the presentation of a memoir for improving the\r\nroute through Tehuantepec, by citizens of Oaxaca, as late as 1775,\r\nan order was issued forbidding the subject to be mentioned. The\r\nmemorialists were censured as intermeddlers, and the viceroy fell under\r\nthe sovereign's displeasure for having seemed to favor the plans.\r\n\r\nThe great isthmus was, however, further explored by the Spanish\r\ngovernment for its own purposes; the recesses were traversed, and the\r\nlines of communication which we know to-day were then noted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that comparatively little was explored north or\r\nsouth of that which early became the main highway, the Panama route,\r\nthere is confirmation here of the truth that Spain concealed and even\r\nfalsified much of her generally accurately made surveys. No stronger\r\nproof of this need be asked than that which Alcedo gives in connection\r\nwith the proposal by Gogueneche, the Biscayan pilot, to open\r\ncommunication by the Atrato and the Napipi. \"The Atrato,\" says the\r\nhistorian, \"is navigable for many leagues, but the navigation of it is\r\nprohibited under pain of death, without the exception of any person\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Isthmus of Nicaragua has always invited serious consideration for\r\na ship canal route by its very marked physical characteristics, among\r\nwhich is chiefly its great depression between two nearly parallel ranges\r\nof hills, which depression is the basin of its large lake, a natural and\r\nall-sufficient feeder for such a canal.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 a squadron of discovery sent out by Cortez on the coast of the\r\nSouth Sea, announced the existence of a fresh water sea at only\r\nthree leagues from the coast; a sea which, they said, rose and fell\r\nalternately, communicating, it was believed, with the Sea of the North.\r\nVarious reconnoissances were therefore made, under the idea that here\r\nthe easy transit would be established between Spain and the spice lands\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nIt was even laid down on some of the old maps, that this open\r\ncommunication by water existed from sea to sea; while later maps\r\nrepresented a river, under the name of Rio Partido, as giving one of\r\nits branches to the Pacific Ocean and the other to Lake Nicaragua. An\r\nexploration by the engineer, Bautista Antonelli, under the orders of\r\nPhilip II., corrected the false idea of an open strait.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century a new cause arose for jealousy of her\r\nneighbors and for keeping her northern part of the isthmus from their\r\nview. In the years 1779 and 1780 the serious purposes of the English\r\ngovernment for the occupancy of Nicaragua, awakened the solicitudes of\r\nthe Spanish government for this section. The English colonels, Hodgson\r\nand Lee, had secretly surveyed the lake and portions of the country,\r\nforwarding their plans to London, as the basis of an armed incursion,\r\nto renew such as had already been made by the superintendent of the\r\nMosquito coast, forty years before, when, crossing the isthmus, he took\r\npossession of Realejo, on the Pacific, seeking to change its name to\r\nPort Edward. In 1780, Captain, afterward Lord Nelson, under orders from\r\nAdmiral Sir Peter Parker, convoyed a force of two thousand men to San\r\nJuan de Nicaragua, for the conquest of the country.\r\n\r\nIn his dispatches, Nelson said: \"In order to give facility to the great\r\nobject of government, I intend to possess the lake of Nicaragua, which,\r\nfor the present, may be looked upon as the inland Gibraltar of Spanish\r\nAmerica. As it commands the only water pass between the oceans, its\r\nsituation must ever render it a principal post to insure passage to the\r\nSouthern Ocean, and by our possession of it Spanish America is severed\r\ninto two.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of San Juan was found to be exceedingly difficult; for the\r\nseamen, although assisted by the Indians from Bluetown, scarcely forced\r\ntheir boats up the shoals. Nelson bitterly regretted that the expedition\r\nhad not arrived in January, in place of the close of the dry season. It\r\nwas a disastrous failure, costing the English the lives of one thousand\r\nfive hundred men, and nearly losing to them their Nelson.\r\n\r\nAt this period, Charles III., of Spain, sent a commission to explore the\r\ncountry. These commissioners reported unfavorably as regarded the route;\r\nbut fearing further intrusion from England, forbade all access to the\r\ncoast; even falsifying and suppressing its charts and permanently\r\ninjuring the navigation of the San Juan and the Colorado by obstructions\r\nin their beds.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a relief here to learn that when Humboldt visited the\r\nNew World, he could say: \"The time is passed when Spain, through a\r\njealous policy, refused to other nations a thoroughfare across the\r\npossessions of which they kept the whole world so long in ignorance.\r\nAccurate maps of the coasts, and even minute plans of military\r\npositions, are published.\" It is also true that the Spanish Cortes,\r\nin 1814, decreed the opening of a canal, a decree deferred and never\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for our century to see this great project carried into\r\nexecution, and it is but just that as a chronicler of events I should\r\nconnect with the Canal of Panama the name of a family who have done much\r\nto bring the scheme, so to say, into practical execution.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1836, Mr. Joly de Sabla turned his views toward the\r\ncutting of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. He resided at the time\r\non the Island of Guadeloupe, one of the French West India Islands,\r\nwhere he possessed large estates. Of a high social position, the\r\nrepresentative of one of France's ancient and noble families, with large\r\nmeans at his disposal and of an enterprising spirit much in advance of\r\nhis time, he was well calculated to carry out such a grand scheme.\r\n\r\nHe soon set about procuring from the Government of New Granada (now\r\nColombia) the necessary grants and concessions, but much time and many\r\nefforts were spent before these could be brought to a satisfactory\r\ncondition, and it was not until the year 1841 that he could again visit\r\nthe Isthmus, bringing with him this time, on a vessel chartered by him\r\nfor the purpose, a corps of engineers and employes, medical staff, etc.,\r\netc. After two years spent in exploring and surveying a country at that\r\ntime very imperfectly known, he returned to Guadeloupe to find his\r\nresidence and most of his estates destroyed by the terrible earthquake\r\nthat visited the island in February, 1843.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by this unexpected and severe blow, Mr. De Sabla persisted in\r\nhis efforts, and in the same year obtained from the French government\r\nthe establishment of a Consulate at Panama to insure protection to the\r\nfuture canal company, and also the sending of two government engineers\r\nof high repute (Messrs. Garella and Courtines), to verify the surveys\r\nalready made and complete them.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the respective reports of Garella and Courtines, Mr.\r\nDe Sabla decided upon first constructing a railway across the Isthmus,\r\npostponing the cutting of the canal until this indispensable auxiliary\r\nshould have rendered it practicable and profitable. He then presented\r\nthe scheme in that shape to his friends in Paris and London, and formed\r\na syndicate of thirteen members, among whom we may recall the names of\r\nthe well known Bankers Caillard of Paris, and Baimbridge of London,\r\nof Sir John Campbell, then Vice President of the Oriental Steamship\r\nCompany, of Viscount Chabrol de Chameane, and of Courtines, the\r\nexploring engineer.\r\n\r\nA new contract was then entered upon with New Granada in June, 1847, and\r\nearly in 1848, the Syndicate was about to forward to the Isthmus the\r\nexpedition which was to execute the preliminary works, while the company\r\nwas being finally organized in Paris, and its stock placed.\r\n\r\nThe success of the undertaking seemed to be assured beyond peradventure,\r\nwhen the unexpected breaking out of the French revolution in February,\r\n1848, dashed all hopes to the ground. Several of the prominent\r\nfinanciers engaged in the affair, taken by surprise by the suddenness of\r\nthe revolution, had to suspend their payments and of course to withdraw\r\nfrom the Panama Canal and railroad scheme. Others withdrew from\r\ncontagious fear and timidity. Finally the term fixed for carrying out\r\ncertain obligations of the contract expired without their fulfillment\r\nby the company, and the concession was forfeited. Another contract was\r\nalmost immediately applied for and granted with unseemly haste by the\r\nPresident of New Granada to Messrs. Aspinwall, Stephens and Chauncey,\r\nwhich resulted in the construction of the actual Panama Railroad.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen acted fairly in the matter, and in 1849, calling Mr.\r\nDe Sabla to New York, offered him to join them in the new scheme.\r\nUnfortunately they had decided upon placing the Atlantic terminus of the\r\nrailroad upon the low and swampy mud Island of Manzanillo, while Mr.\r\nDe Sabla insisted on having it on the mainland on the dry and healthy\r\nnorthern shore of the Bay of Limon. They could not come to an\r\nunderstanding on this point, and Mr. De Sabla, whose experience and\r\nforesight taught him the dangers that would result to the shipping from\r\nthe unprotected situation of the projected part (now Colon--Aspinwall),\r\nand who well knew the insalubrity of the malarial swamp constituting\r\nthe Island of Manzanillo, withdrew forever from the undertaking, after\r\nhaving devoted to it without any benefit to himself, the best years of\r\nhis life and a large portion of his private means.\r\n\r\nOne of his sons, Mr. Theodore J. de Sabla, after having actively\r\nco-operated with Lieutenant Commander Wyse, in the original scheme\r\nof the present canal company, is now one of Count de Lesseps's\r\nrepresentatives in the City of New York, and a director of the Panama\r\nRailroad Company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED AVERAGING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent meeting of the American Society of Civil Engineers, in\r\nthis city, a paper on an improved form of the averaging machine was read\r\nby its inventor, Mr. Wm. S. Auchincloss.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious method by which the weight of the platform is eliminated\r\nfrom the result of the work of the machine was exhibited and explained.\r\nThis is accomplished by counterweights sliding automatically in tubes,\r\nso that in any position the unloaded platform is always in equilibrium.\r\nAny combination of representative weights can then be placed on this\r\nplatform at the proper points of the scale. By then drawing the platform\r\nto its balancing point, the location of the center of gravity will at\r\nonce be indicated on the scale by the pointer over the central trunnion.\r\n\r\nThe weights may be arranged on a decimal system, with intermediate\r\nweights for closer working, or they may be made so as to express\r\nmultiples or factors.\r\n\r\nEach machine is provided with a number of differing scales, divided\r\nsuitably for various purposes. When the problem is one of time, the\r\nscale represents months and days; for problems of proportion, the zero\r\nof the scale is at the center of its length; for problems for the\r\nlocation of center of gravity of a system from a fixed point, the zero\r\nis at the extremity of the scale, etc.\r\n\r\nThe machine exhibited has sixty-three transverse grooves, which, by\r\narrangement of weights, can be made to serve the purposes of two hundred\r\nand fifty-two grooves.\r\n\r\nThe machine is 29 inches in length, 9 inches in width, and weighs about\r\n13 pounds.\r\n\r\nWith the machine can be found average dates, as, for instance, of\r\npurchases and of payments extending over irregular periods; also average\r\nprices, as for \"futures,\" in comman use among cotton brokers. The\r\nproblem of average haul, so often presented to the engineer, can be\r\nsolved with ease and great celerity. Practical examples of the solution\r\nof these and a number of other problems involving proportions or\r\naverages were given by the author.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND BEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engine represented in Figs. 1 to 4 herewith is intended for a mill,\r\nand is of 530 to 800 indicated horse-power, the pressure being seven\r\natmospheres, and the number of revolutions forty-five per minute. As\r\nwill be seen by the drawing each cylinder is placed in a separate\r\nfoundation plate, the two connecting rods acting upon cranks keyed\r\nat right angles upon the shaft, W, which carries the drum, T. The\r\nhigh-pressure cylinder, C, is 760 mm diameter, the low pressure cylinder\r\nbeing 1,220 mm. diameter, and the piston speed 2.28 m. The drum, which\r\nalso fulfills the purpose of a fly wheel, is provided with twenty-eight\r\ngrooves for ropes of 50 mm. diameter. With the exception of the\r\ncylinders, pistons, valves, and valve chests, the engines are of the\r\nsame size, corresponding to the equal maximum pressures which come into\r\naction in each cylinder, and in this respect alone the engine differs in\r\nprinciple from an ordinary twin machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORSIG'S IMPROVED COPOUND BEAM ENGINE. FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThe steam passes from the stop-valve, A, Fig. 4, through the steam pipe,\r\nD, to the high pressure cylinder, C, and having done its work, goes into\r\nthe receiver, R, where it is heated. From the receiver it is led into\r\nthe low-pressure cylinder, C1, and thence into the condenser. Provision\r\nis made for working both engines independently with direct steam when\r\ndesired, suitable gear being provided for supplying steam of the proper\r\npressure to the condensing engine, so that each engine shall perform\r\nexactly the same amount of work. The starting gear consists of a\r\nhand-wheel, H, which controls the stop valve, A, and of another h, which\r\nopens the valves for the jackets of the cylinders and receiver. The\r\nhand-wheel, h1 and h2, govern the valves, which turn the steam direct\r\ninto the two cylinders. There are also lever, g, which opens the\r\nprincipal injection cock, H1, and the auxiliary injection cock, H2, the\r\nfunction of which is to assist in forming a speedy vacuum, when the\r\nengine has been standing for some time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORSIG'S IMPROVED COPOUND BEAM ENGINE. FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nThe drum is 6.08 m. diameter, the breadth being 2.04 m., with a total\r\nweight of 33,000 kilos. The beams are of cast iron with balance weights\r\ncast on. The connecting rods and cross beams are of wrought iron, and\r\nthe cranks, crank shaft, piston rods, valve rods, etc., of steel. The\r\nbed-plate for the main shaft bearings are cast in one piece with the\r\nstandards for the beam, which are connected firmly together by the\r\ncenter bearing, M M1, which is cast in one piece, and also by the\r\ndiagonal bracing piece, N N1. The construction of the cylinder and valve\r\nchests is shown in Fig. 1. The working cylinder is in the form of a\r\nliner to the cylinder, thus forming the steam jacket, with a view to\r\nfuture renewal. This lining has a flange at the lower part for bolting\r\nit down, being made steam-tight by the intervention of a copper packing\r\nring. There is a similar ring at the upper part which is pressed down by\r\nthe cylinder cover. The latter is cast hollow and strengthened by ribs.\r\nThe pistons are provided with cast iron double self-expanding packing\r\nrings. For preventing accidents by condensed water, spring safety\r\nvalves, ss and s1 s1, are connected to the valve chests. The valve gear,\r\nwhich is arranged in the same manner for both cylinders, is actuated\r\nby shafts, w and w1, rotated by toothed wheels as shown. Motion is\r\ncommunicated from the way-shafts, w and w1, by the eccentrics, and the\r\neccentric rods, e1 e2 e3 e4, and the levers and rods belonging thereto,\r\nto the short steam valve rocking shafts levers, f1 f2 f3 f4, and the\r\nexhaust valve rocking shafts, k1 k2 k3 k4, the bearings of which are\r\ncarried on brackets above the valve chests, which, being furnished with\r\ntappet levers, raise and lower the valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORSIG'S IMPROVED COPOUND BEAM ENGINE. FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nThe valves are conical, double-seated, and of cast iron, and the inlet\r\nand outlet valves are placed the one above the other, the seats being\r\nalso conically ground and inserted through the cover of the valve chest.\r\nBoth inlet and outlet valves are actuated from above, and are removable\r\nupward, an arrangement which admits of the valves being more easily\r\nexamined than when the two are actuated from different sides of the\r\nvalve chest. To carry out this idea the inlet valves are furnished with\r\ntwo guides, which, passing upward through the stuffing-box, are attached\r\nto a hard steel cross piece, which receives the action of a bent catch\r\nturning on a pin attached to the levers, t1, t2, t3, t4. The exhaust\r\nvalves, on the contrary, have only one guide each, which passes upward\r\nthrough the seat of the admission valve, through the valve itself by\r\nmeans of a collar, and through the stuffing-box. It is furnished with\r\nhard steel armatures, through which the levers, z1 z2, Fig. 3, act upon\r\nthe exhaust valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORSIG'S IMPROVED COPOUND BEAM ENGINE. FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nThe governor effects the acceleration or retardation of the loosening of\r\nthe catch actuating the steam valve by means of hard steel projections\r\non the shaft, v1, the position of which, by means of levers, is\r\nregulated by the governor, which in its highest position does not allow\r\nthe lifting of the inlet valve at all. The regulation of the expansion\r\nby the governor from 0 to 0.45 takes place generally only in the case of\r\nthe high-pressure cylinder, while the low-pressure cylinder has a fixed\r\nrate of expansion. Only when the low-pressure cylinder is required\r\nto work with steam direct from the boiler is the governor applied to\r\nregulate the expansion in it. An exact action in the valve guides and\r\na regular descent is secured by furnishing them with small dash pot\r\npistons working in cylinders. Into them the air is readily admitted by\r\na small India-rubber valve, but the passage out again is controlled at\r\npleasure.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DETECT ALKALIES IN NITRATE OF SILVER--Stolba recommends the salt\r\nto be dissolved in the smallest quantity of water, and to add to\r\nthe filtered solution hydrofluosilicic acid, drop by drop.

It was also necessary that the vibration and\r\nshock of the hammer head should not be transmitted to the driving\r\nmechanism, and that the latter should be free from noise and liability\r\nto derangement. The various uses to which the movable fulcrum hammers\r\nhave been put, and their success in working[1]--as well as the\r\nimportance of the general subject which includes them, namely, the\r\nsubstitution of stored power for human effort--form the author's excuse\r\nfor now occupying the time of the meeting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The hammers have been for some years used by A. Bamlett, of\r\nThirsk; the American Tool Company, of Antwerp; Messrs. W.&T. Avery, of\r\nBirmingham; Pullar & Sons, of Perth; Salter & Co., of West Bromwich;\r\nVernon Hope & Co., of Wednesbury, etc.; and also for stamps by Messrs.\r\nCollins & Co., of Birmingham, etc.]\r\n\r\nUntil these hammers were introduced, no satisfactory method had been\r\ndevised for altering the force of the blow. The plan generally adopted\r\nwas to have either a tightening pulley acting on the driving belt, a\r\nfriction driving clutch, or a simple brake on the driving pulley, put in\r\naction by the hand or foot of the workman. Heavy blows were produced\r\nby simply increasing the number of blows per minute (and therefore the\r\nvelocity), and light blows by diminishing it--a plan which was quite\r\ncontrary to the true requirements of the case. To prevent the shock\r\nof the hammer head being communicated to the driving gear, an elastic\r\nconnection was usually formed between them, consisting of a steel spring\r\nor a cushion of compressed air. With the steel spring, the variation\r\nwhich could be given in the thickness of the work under the hammer was\r\nvery limited, owing to the risk of breaking the spring; but with the\r\ncompressed air or pneumatic connection the work might vary considerably\r\nin thickness, say from 0 to 8 in. with a hammer weighing 400lb. The\r\npneumatic hammers had a crank, with a connecting rod or a slotted\r\ncrossbar on the piston-rod, a piston and a cylinder which formed the\r\nhammer-head. The piston-rod was packed with a cup leather, or with\r\nordinary packing, the latter required to be adjusted with the greatest\r\nnicety, otherwise the piston struck the hammer before lifting it, or\r\nelse the force of the blow was considerably diminished. As the piston\r\nmoved with the same velocity during its upward and downward strokes,\r\nand, in the latter, had to overtake and outrun the hammer falling under\r\nthe action of gravity, the air was not compressed sufficiently to give\r\na sharp blow at ordinary working speeds, and a much heavier hammer was\r\nrequired than if the velocity of the piston had been accelerated to a\r\ngreater degree.\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible in the limits of this paper to describe all the\r\nforms in which the movable fulcrum hammers have been arranged, two types\r\nonly will be selected taken from actual work; namely, a small planishing\r\nhammer, and a medium-sized forging hammer.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To the makers, Messrs. J. Scott Rawlings & Co, of\r\nBirmingham, the author is indebted for the working drawings of these\r\nhammers.]\r\n\r\nThe small planishing hammer, Figs. 1 to 3, next page, is used for\r\ncopper, tin, electro, and iron plate, for scythes, and other thin work,\r\nfor which it is sufficient to adjust the force of the blow once for all\r\nby hand, according to the thickness and quality of the material before\r\ncommencing to hammer it. The hammer weighs 15 lb., and has a stroke\r\nvariable from 2½ in. to 9½ in., and makes 250 blows per minute. The\r\ndriving shaft, A, is fitted with fast and loose belt pulleys, the belt\r\nfork being connected to the pedal, P, which when pressed down by the\r\nfoot of the workman, slides the driving belt on to the fast pulley and\r\nstarts the hammer; when the foot is taken off the pedal, the weight on\r\nthe latter moves the belt quickly on to the loose pulley, and the hammer\r\nis stopped. The flywheel on the shaft, A, is weighted on one side,\r\nso that it causes the hammer to stop at the top of its stroke after\r\nworking; thus enabling the material to be placed on the anvil before\r\nstarting the hammer. The movable fulcrum, B, consists of a stud, free to\r\nslide in a slot, C, in the framing, and held in position by a nut and\r\ntoothed washer. On the fulcrum is mounted the socket, D, through which\r\npasses freely a round bar or rocking lever, E, attached at one end to\r\nthe main piston, F, of the hammer, G, and having at the other extremity\r\na long slide, H, mounted upon it. This slide is carried on the\r\ncrank-pin, I, fastened to the disk, J, attached to the driving shaft, A.\r\nThe crank-pin, in revolving, reciprocates the rocking lever, E, and\r\nmain piston, F, and through the medium of the pneumatic connection, the\r\nhammer, G. The slide, H, in revolving with the crank-pin, also moves\r\nbackward and forward along the rocking lever, approaching the fulcrum,\r\nB, during the down-stroke of the hammer, and receding from it during\r\nthe up-stroke. By this means the velocity of the hammer is considerably\r\naccelerated in its downward stroke, causing a sharp blow to be given\r\nwhile it is gently raised during its upward stroke.\r\n\r\nTo alter the force of the blow, the hammer, G, is made to rise and fall\r\nthrough a greater or less distance, as may be required, from the fixed\r\nanvil block, K, after the manner of the smith giving heavy or light\r\nblows on his anvil. It is evident that this special alteration of the\r\nstroke could not be obtained by altering the throw of a simple crank and\r\nconnecting rod; but by placing the slot, C, parallel with the direction\r\nof the rocking lever, E, when the latter is in its lowest position, with\r\nthe hammer resting on the anvil, and with the crank at the top of its\r\nstroke, this lowest position of the rocking lever and hammer is made\r\nconstant, no matter what position the fulcrum, B, may have in the slot,\r\nC. To obtain a short stroke, and consequently a light blow, the fulcrum\r\nis moved in the slot toward the hammer, G; and to produce a long stroke\r\nand heavy blow the fulcrum is moved in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 gives the details of the pneumatic connection between the main\r\npiston and the hammer, in which packing and packing glands are dispensed\r\nwith. The hammer, G, is of cast steel, bored out to fit the main piston,\r\nF, the latter being also bored out to receive an internal piston, L. A\r\npin, M, passing freely through slots in the main piston, F, connects\r\nrigidly the internal piston, L, with the hammer, G. When the main piston\r\nis raised by the rocking lever, the air in the space, X, between the\r\nmain and internal pistons, is compressed, and forms an elastic medium\r\nfor lifting the hammer; when the main piston is moved down, the air in\r\nthe space, Y, is compressed in its turn, and the hammer forced down to\r\ngive the blow. Two holes drilled in the side of the hammer renew the air\r\nautomatically in the spaces, X and Y, at each blow of the hammer.\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 to 6, on the next page, represent the medium size forging\r\nhammer, for making forgings in dies, swaging and tilting bars, and\r\nplating edged tools, etc.\r\n\r\nThe hammer weighs 1 cwt., has a stroke variable from 4 in. to 14½ in.,\r\nand gives 200 blows per minute; the compressed air space between the\r\nmain piston and the hammer is sufficiently long to admit forgings up to\r\n3 in. thick under the hammer.\r\n\r\nTo make forgings economically, it is necessary to bring them into the\r\ndesired form by a few heavy blows, while the material is still in a\r\nhighly plastic condition, and then to finish them by a succession of\r\nlighter blows. The heavy blows should be given at a slower rate than the\r\nlighter ones, to allow time for turning the work in the dies or on the\r\nanvil, and so to avoid the risk of spoiling it. In forging with the\r\nsteam hammer the workman requires an assistant, who, with the lever\r\nof the valve motion in hand, obeys his directions as to starting and\r\nstopping, heavy or light blows, slow or quick blows, etc; the quickest\r\nspeed attainable depending on the speed of the arm of the assistant.\r\nIn the movable-fulcrum forging hammer the operations of starting and\r\nstopping, and the giving of heavy or light blows, are under the complete\r\ncontrol of one foot of the workman, who requires therefore no assistant;\r\nand by properly proportioning the diameter of the driving pulley and\r\nsize of belt to the hammer, the heavy blows are given at a slower rate\r\nthan the light ones, owing to the greater resistance which they offer to\r\nthe driving belt.\r\n\r\nIn this hammer the pneumatic connection, the arrangements for the\r\nstarting, stopping, and holding up of the hammer, as well as those for\r\ncommunicating the motion of the crank-pin to the hammer by means of\r\na rocking lever and movable fulcrum, are similar to those in the\r\nplanishing hammer, differing only in the details, which provide double\r\nguides and bearings for the principal working parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGWORTH'S POWER HAMMER WITH MOVABLE FULCRUM.]\r\n\r\nThe movable fulcrum, B, Figs. 4 and 5, consists of two adjustable steel\r\npins, attached to the fulcrum lever, Q, and turned conical where they\r\nfit in the socket, D. The fulcrum lever is pivoted on a pin, R, fixed in\r\nthe framing of the machine, and is connected at its lower extremity\r\nto the nut, S, in gear with the regulating screw, T. The to-and-fro\r\nmovement of the fulcrum lever, Q, by which heavy or light blows are\r\ngiven by the hammer, is placed under the control of the foot of the\r\nworkman, in the following manner: U is a double-ended forked lever,\r\npivoted in the center, and having one end embracing the starting pedal,\r\nP, and the other end the small belt which connects the fast pulley\r\non the driving shaft, A, with the loose pulley, V, or the reversing\r\npulleys, W and X. These are respectivly connected with the bevel wheels,\r\nW_{1}, and X_{1}, gearing into and placed at opposite sides of the bevel\r\nwheel, Z, on the regulating screw in connection with the fulcrum lever.\r\nWhen the workman places his foot on the pedal, P, to start the hammer,\r\nhe finds his foot within the fork of the lever, U; and by slightly\r\nturning his foot round on his heel he can readily move the forked\r\nlever to right or left, so shifting the small belt on to either of the\r\nreversing pulleys, W or X, and causing the regulating screw, T, to\r\nrevolve in either direction. The fulcrum lever is thus caused to move\r\nforward or backward, to give light or heavy blows. By moving the forked\r\nlever into mid position, the small belt is shifted into its usual place\r\non the loose pulley, V, and the fulcrum remains at rest. To fix the\r\nlightest and heaviest blow required for each kind of work, adjustable\r\nstops are provided, and are mounted on a rod, Y, connected to an arm of\r\nthe forked lever. When the nut of the regulating screw comes in contact\r\nwith either of the stops, the forked lever is forced into mid position,\r\nin spite of the pressure of the foot of the workman, and thus further\r\nmovement of the fulcrum lever, in the direction which it was taking,\r\nis prevented. The movable fulcrum can also be adjusted by hand to any\r\nrequired blow, when the hammer is stopped, by means of a handle in\r\nconnection with the regulating screw.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the author wishes to direct attention to the fact, that in\r\nmany of our largest manufactories, particularly in the midland counties,\r\nfoot and hand labor for forging and stamping is still employed to an\r\nenormous extent. Hundreds of \"Olivers,\" with hammers up to 60 lb. in\r\nweight, are laboriously put in motion by the foot of the workman, at a\r\nspeed averaging fifty blows per minute; while large numbers of stamps,\r\nworked by hand and foot, and weighing up to 120 lb., are also employed.\r\nThe low first cost of the foot hammers and stamps, combined with the\r\nsystem of piece work, and the desire of manufacturers to keep their\r\nmethods of working secret, have no doubt much to do with the small\r\namount of progress that has been made; although in a few cases\r\ncompetition, particularly with the United States of America, has forced\r\nthe manufacturer to throw the Oliver and hand-stamp aside, and to employ\r\nsteam power hammers and stamps. The writer believes that in connection\r\nwith forging and stamping processes there is still a wide and profitable\r\nfield for the ingenuity and capital of engineers, who choose to\r\noccupy themselves with this minor, but not the less useful, branch of\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BICHEROUX SYSTEM OF FURNACES APPLIED TO THE PUDDLING OF IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the year 1872, the large iron works at Ougrée, near Liege, have\r\napplied the Bicheroux system of furnaces to heating, and, since the\r\nyear 1877, to puddling. The results that have been obtained in this\r\nlast-named application are so satisfactory that it appears to us to be\r\nof interest to speak of the matter in some detail.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, which is shown in the opposite page, consists of three\r\ndistinct parts: (1) a gas generator; (2) a mixing chamber into which\r\nthe gases and air are drawn by the natural draught, and wherein the\r\ncombustion of the gases begins; and (3) a furnace, or laboratory (not\r\nrepresented in the figure), wherein the combustion is nearly finished,\r\nand wherein take place the different reactions of puddling. These three\r\nparts are given dimensions that vary according to the composition of the\r\ndifferent coals, and they may be made to use any sort of coal, even\r\nthe fine and schistose kinds which would not be suitable for ordinary\r\npuddling. The gases and the air necessary for the combustion of these\r\nbeing brought together at different temperatures, and being drawn into\r\nthe mixing chamber through the same chimney, it will be seen that the\r\ndimensions of the flues that conduct them should vary with the kind of\r\ncoal used; and the manner in which the gases are brought together is not\r\na matter of indifference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BICHEROUX SYSTEM OF FURNACE.\r\n\r\nVertical Section, and Horizontal Section through MNOPQR]\r\n\r\nThe gas generator consists of a hopper, A, into which drops, through\r\nsmall apertures a, the coal piled up on the platform, D. These apertures\r\nare closed with coal or bricks. The bottom of the generator is formed of\r\na small standing grate. The coal, on falling upon a mass in a state of\r\nignition, distills and becomes transformed into coke, which gradually\r\nslides down over a grate to produce afterward, through its own\r\ncombustion, a distillation of the coal following it. But as these are\r\nfeatures found in all generators we will not dwell upon them.\r\n\r\nThe gases that are produced flow through a long horizontal flue, B, into\r\na vertical conduit, E, into which there debouches at the upper part a\r\nseries of small orifices, F, that conduct the air that has been heated.\r\nThe gases are inflamed, and traverse the furnace c (not shown in the\r\ncut), from whence they go to the chimney. Before the air is allowed to\r\nreach the intervening chamber it is made to pass into the sole of the\r\nfurnace and into the walls of the chamber, so that to the advantage of\r\nhaving the air heated there is joined the additional one of having those\r\nportions of the furnace cooled that cannot be heated with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe incompletely burned gases that escape from the furnace are utilized\r\nin heating the boilers of the establishment. The dimensions given these\r\nfurnaces vary greatly according to the charge to be used. All the\r\nresults at Ougrée have been obtained with 400 kilogramme charges,\r\nand the dimensions of the gas generators have been calculated for\r\nSix-Bonniers coal, which does not yield over 20 per cent. of gas.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this system, which permits of expediting all the\r\noperations of puddling, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A notable economy in fuel, both as regards quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n2. Economy resulting from diminution in the waste of metal, with a\r\nconsequent improvement in the quality of the products obtained.\r\n\r\n3. Diminution in cost of repairs.\r\n\r\n4. Less rapid wear in the grates.\r\n\r\n5. Improvement in the conditions of the work of puddling.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first of these advantages, it may be stated that the\r\npuddling of ordinary Ougrée forge iron, which required with other\r\nfurnaces 900 to 1,000 kilogrammes of coal, is now performed with less\r\nthan 600 kilogrammes per ton of the iron produced. The puddling of fine\r\ngrained iron which required 1,300 to 1,500 kilogrammes of coal is now\r\ndone with 800. So much for quantity; as for quality the system presents\r\nalso a very marked advantage in that it requires no rolling coal--the\r\noperation of the furnace being just as regular with fine coal, even that\r\nsifted through screens of 0.02 meter.\r\n\r\nThe second class of advantages naturally results from the almost\r\ncomplete prevention of access of cold air. The saving in wastage amounts\r\nto 3 or 4 per cent., that is to say, 100 kilogrammes of iron produced is\r\naccompanied by a loss of only 9 to 10 kilogrammes, instead of 13 to 15\r\nas ordinarily reckoned.\r\n\r\nThe diminution in the cost of repairs is due to the fact that the\r\nfurnace doors, of which there are two, permit of easy access to all\r\nparts of the sole; moreover, the coal never coming in contact with the\r\nfire-bridges, the latter last much longer than those in other styles of\r\nfurnaces, and can be used for several weeks without the necessity of\r\nthe least repair. The reduced wear of the grates results from the low\r\ntemperature that can be used in the furnace, and the quantity of clinker\r\nthat can be left therein without interfering with its operation, thus\r\npermitting of having the grates always black. These latter in no wise\r\nchange, and after five months of work the square bars still preserve\r\ntheir sharpness of edges.\r\n\r\nAs for the improvements in the conditions of the work of puddling, it\r\nmay be stated that with a uniform price per 100 kilogrammes for all the\r\nfurnaces, the laborers working at the gas furnaces can earn 25 to 30 per\r\ncent. more than those working at ordinary furnaces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGESSNER'S CONTINUOUS CLOTH-PRESSING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there are several serious drawbacks in the usual\r\nplan of pressing woolen or worsted cloths and felts with press plates,\r\npress papers, and presses. Three objections of great weight may be\r\nmentioned, and events in Leeds give emphasis to a fourth. The three\r\nobjections are--the labor required in setting or folding the cloth,\r\nthe expense of the press papers, and the time required. The fourth\r\nobjection, about which a dispute has occurred between the press-setters\r\nand the master finishers in Leeds, refers to the inapplicability of the\r\ncommon system to long lengths. The men object to these on account of\r\nthe great labor involved in shifting the heavy mass of cloth and press\r\nplates to and from the presses. A minor drawback of this system is\r\nthat it involves the presence of a fold up the middle of the piece. On\r\naccount of these drawbacks it has long been understood to be desirable\r\nto expedite the process, and also to dispense with the press papers.\r\nThis is the main purpose of the machine we now illustrate in section, in\r\nwhich the pressing is done continuously by what may be termed a species\r\nof ironing. The machine consists of a central hollow cylinder, C,\r\nthree-quarters of the circumference of which is covered by the hollow\r\nboxes, M, heated by steam through the pipes shown, and which are\r\nmounted upon the levers, BB', whose fulcra are at bb. By means of the\r\nhand-wheel, T, and worm-wheel, n, which closes or opens the levers, BB',\r\nthe pressure of the boxes upon the central roller may be adjusted at\r\nwill, the spring-bolt, F, allowing a certain amount of yield. The faces\r\nof the press-boxes, MM, are covered by a curved sheet of German silver\r\nattached to the point, Y. This sheet takes the place of the press papers\r\nin the ordinary process. The course of the cloth through the machine is\r\nas follows, and is shown by the arrows: It is placed on the bottom board\r\nin front, and in its travel it passes over the rails, O, after which it\r\nis operated on by the brush, Z, leaving which it is conveyed over the\r\nrails, V and I, the rollers, K and P, and thence between the pressing\r\nroller, C, and the German silver press plate covering the heated boxes,\r\nM. Leaving these the piece passes over the roller, P, and is cuttled\r\ndown in the bottom board by the cuttling motion, F, or a rolling-up\r\nmotion may be applied. The maker states that arrangements for brushing\r\nand steaming may also be attached, so that in one passage through the\r\nmachine a piece may be pressed, brushed, and steamed. The speed of the\r\ncylinder may be adjusted according to the quality or requirements of\r\nthe goods that are under treatment. At the time of our visit, says the\r\n_Textile Manufacturer_, printed woolen pieces were being pressed at the\r\nrate of about four yards a minute, but higher speeds are often obtained.\r\nMessrs. Taylor, Wordsworth & Co., who have erected many of these\r\nmachines in Leeds, Bradford, and Batley, inform us that they find they\r\nare adapted for the pressing of a wide variety of cloths, from Bradford\r\ngoods and thin serges to the heavy pieces of Dewsbury and Batley. The\r\ninventor, Ernst Gessner, of Aue, Saxony, adopts an ingenious expedient\r\nfor pressing goods with thick lists. He provides an arrangement for\r\nmoving the cylinder endwise, according to the different widths of\r\nthe pieces to be treated. One list is left outside at the end of the\r\ncylinder, and the other at the opposite end of the pressing boxes. The\r\nmachine we saw was 80 in. wide on the roller, and it was one the design\r\nand construction of which undoubtedly do credit to Mr. Gessner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN WOOLEN CARDING ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bolette, who has made a name for himself in connection with strap\r\ndividers, has experimented in another direction on the carding engine,\r\nand as his ideas contain some points of novelty we herewith give the\r\nnecessary illustrations, so that our readers can judge for themselves as\r\nto the merit of these inventions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the feeding arrangement. Here the wool is delivered by\r\nthe feed rollers, A A, in the usual manner. The longer fibers are then\r\ntaken off by a comb, B, and brought forward to the stripper, E, which\r\ntransfers them to the roller, H, and thence to the cylinder. The shorter\r\nfibers which are not seized by the comb fall down, but as they drop\r\nthey meet a blast of air created by a fan, which throws the lighter and\r\ncleaner parts in a kind of spray upon the roller, L, whence they pass on\r\nto the cylinder, while the dirt and other heavier parts fall downwards\r\ninto a box, and are by this means kept off the cylinder. It is evident\r\nthat in this arrangement it is not intended to keep the long and the\r\nshort fibers separate, but to utilize them all in the formation of\r\nthe yarn. The arrangement shown in Fig. 2 refers to the delivery end.\r\nInstead of the sliver being wound upon the roller in the usual way, it\r\nruns upon a sheet of linen, P¹, as in the case of carding for felt, with\r\na to-and-fro motion in the direction of the axis of the rollers. In this\r\nway one or more layers of the fleece can be placed on the sheet, which\r\nin that case passes backwards and forwards from roller S to R, and _vice\r\nversa_. It is, in fact, the bat arrangement used for felt, only with\r\nthis difference, that the bat is at once rolled up instead of going\r\nthrough the bat frame. In the manufacture of felt it is of course of\r\nimportance to have many very thin layers of fleece superposed over\r\neach other in order to equalize it, and if the same is applied to the\r\nmanufacture of cloth it will no doubt give satisfactory results, but may\r\nbe rather costly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVELTIES IN RING SPINDLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the drawbacks of ring spinning is the uneven pull of the\r\ntraveler, which is the more difficult to counteract as it is exerted\r\nin jerks at irregular intervals. It is argued that with spindles and\r\nbearings as usually made the spindle is supported firmly in its bearing,\r\nand cannot give in case of such a lateral pull when exerted through the\r\nyarn by the traveler, and the consequence is either a breakage of the\r\nyarn or an uneven thread. Impressed with this idea, and in order to\r\nremedy this defect, an eminent Swiss firm has hit upon the notion of\r\ndriving the spindle by friction, and to make it more or less loose in\r\nthe bearings, so that in case of an extra pull by the traveler the\r\nspindle can give way a little, and thus prevent the breakage of the\r\nyarn. This idea has been carried out in four different ways, and as this\r\nseems to be an entirely new departure in ring spinning, we give the\r\nillustrations of their construction in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents Bourcart's recent arrangement of attaching the thread\r\nguide to the spindle rail and the adjustable spindle. The spindle is\r\nheld by the sleeve, g, which latter is screwed into the spindle rail, S,\r\nthis being moved by the pinion, a; the collar is elongated upwards in a\r\ncuplike form, c, the better to hold the oil, and keep it from flying;\r\nd is the wharf, which has attached to it the sleeve, m, and which is\r\nsituated loosely in the space between the spindle and the footstep, e.\r\nAbove the wharf the spindle is hexagonal in shape, and to this part is\r\nattached the friction plate, a. Between the latter and the upper surface\r\nof the wharf a cloth or felt washer is inserted, to act as a brake. The\r\nfootstep, e, is filled with oil, in which run the foot of the spindle\r\nand the sleeve m, the latter turning upon a steel ring situated on the\r\nbottom of the footstep. As, thus, the foot of the spindle is quite free,\r\nthe upper part of the spindle can give sideways in the direction of any\r\nsudden pull, and the foot of the spindle can follow this motion in the\r\nopposite direction, the collar forming the fulcrum for the spindle. By\r\nthis alteration of the vertical position of the spindle into an inclined\r\none (though ever so trifling), the contact of the friction plate, a, and\r\nthe wharf is interrupted, and thus the speed of the spindle reduced.\r\nThis will cause less yarn to be wound on, and the pull thus to be\r\nneutralized; but as the wharf keeps turning at the same speed, its\r\ncentrifugal force will act again upon the friction plate, and thus bring\r\nthe spindle back to its vertical position as soon as the extra drag has\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 the footstep, e, has the foot of the spindle more closely\r\nfitting at the bottom, but the upper part of the step opens out\r\ngradually, and forms a conical cavity of a little larger diameter than\r\nthe spindle, so that the latter has a considerable play sideways. The\r\nwharf carries in its lower part the sleeve, g, which runs upon a steel\r\nring as above. The upper surface of the wharf is arched, and upon this\r\nis fitted the correspondingly arched friction plate, a, which latter\r\nis attached to the spindle by a screw. The position of the spindle is\r\nmaintained by the collar, m. This collar is loose in the spindle rail,\r\nand only held by the spring, m'. If now, a lateral drag is exerted upon\r\nthe upper part of the spindle, the collar car follows the direction of\r\nthis drag, and the spindle thus be brought out of the vertical position,\r\nthe friction plate slipping at the same time. The force of the spring\r\nconjointly with the centrifugal force will then bring back the spindle\r\ninto its normal position as soon as the drag is again even.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows a spindle with a very long conical oil vessel, B, resting\r\nupon a disk, e\", in cup, e', with a cover, e\"'. The wharf, d, is here\r\nsituated high up the spindle, has the same sleeve as in the preceding\r\ncase, and runs round the bush, g, upon the ring, z. The friction plate\r\nresting upon the wharf is joined to the collar, a, running out into a\r\ncup shape, which is fixed to the spindle, which here has a hexagonal\r\nform. In this case the collar gives with the spindle, which latter\r\nhas the necessary play in the long footstep; and as the collar and\r\nfriction-plate are one, it is brought back to its normal place by\r\ncentrifugal force.\r\n\r\nA peculiar arrangement is shown in Fig. 4. Here the ring and traveler,\r\nf, are placed as usual, but the spindle carries at the same time an\r\ninverted flier, t. The spindle turns loosely in the footstep, e, the\r\noil chamber being carried up to the middle of its height. The wharf\r\nis placed in the same position as in the previous case, having also\r\na sleeve running in the oil chamber, c, upon a steel ring, z. The\r\nfriction-plate a, on the top of the wharf carries the flier, and on its\r\nupper surface is in contact with the inverted cup, a, which is attached\r\nto the spindle by a pin or screw. In order to limit at will the lateral\r\nmotion of the spindle there is attached to the latter, between the\r\nfootstep and the collar, a split ring, i, which can be closed more\r\nor less by a small set screw. The spindle is thus only held in the\r\nperpendicular position by its own velocity, which will facilitate a\r\nhigh degree of speed, through the entire absence of all friction in the\r\nbearings, this vertical position being assisted by the friction motion\r\nwhenever the spindle has been drawn on one side. Although the notion of\r\nmounting spindles so that they can yield in order to center themselves\r\nis not new, it is evident that considerable ingenuity has been brought\r\nto bear upon the arrangement of the spindles we have described, but we\r\nare not in a position to say to what extent practice has in this case\r\ncoincided with theory.--_Textile Manufacturer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTO-ENGRAVING ON ZINC OR COPPER.\r\n\r\nBy LEON VIDAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis process is similar in many respects to the one which was some\r\ntime ago communicated to the Photographic Society of France by M.\r\nStronbinsky, of St. Petersburg, but in a much improved and complete\r\nform. An account of it was given by M. Gobert, at the meeting of the\r\nsame society, on the 2d December, 1882. The following are the details,\r\nas demonstrated by me at the meeting of the 9th of May last:\r\n\r\nSheets of zinc or of copper of a convenient size are carefully planished\r\nand polished with powdered pumice stone. The sensitive mixture is\r\ncomposed of:\r\n\r\n  The whites of four fresh eggs beaten\r\n  to a froth......................... 100    parts\r\n  Pure bichromate of ammonia.........   2.50   \"\r\n  Water..............................  50      \"\r\n\r\nAfter this mixture has been carefully filtered through a paper filter, a\r\nfew drops of ammonia are added. It will keep good for some time if well\r\ncorked and preserved from exposure to the light. Even two months after\r\nbeing prepared I have found it to be still good; but too large a\r\nquantity should not be prepared at a time, as it does not improve with\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nI find that the dry albumen of commerce will answer as well as the\r\nfresh. In that case I employ the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Dry albumen from eggs.............. 15 to 20    parts\r\n  Water..............................      100      \"\r\n  Ammonia bichromate.................        2.50   \"\r\n\r\nAlways add some drops of ammonia, and keep this mixture in a well corked\r\nbottle and in a dark place.\r\n\r\nTo coat the metal plate, place it on a turning table, to which it is\r\nmade fast at the center by a pneumatic holder; to assure the perfect\r\nadhesion of this holder, it is as well to wet the circular elastic ring\r\nof the holder before applying it to the metallic surface. When this is\r\ndone, the table may be made to rotate quickly without fear of detaching\r\nthe plate by the rapidity of the movement. The plate is placed in a\r\nperfectly horizontal position, where no dust can settle on it; the\r\nmixture is then poured on it, and distributed by means of a triangular\r\npiece of soft paper, so as to cover equally all the parts of the plate.\r\nCare should be taken not to flow too much liquid over the plate, and\r\nwhen the latter is everywhere coated, the excess is poured off into a\r\ndifferent vessel from that which contains the filtered mixture, or else\r\ninto a filter resting on that vessel. The turning table should now be\r\ninverted so that the sensitive surface may be downwards, and it is made\r\nto rotate at first slowly, afterwards more rapidly, so as to make the\r\nfilm, which should be very thin, quite smooth and even. The whole\r\noperation should be carried out in a subdued light, as too strong a\r\nlight would render insoluble the film of bichromated albumen.\r\n\r\nWhen the film is equalized the plate must be detached from the turning\r\ntable and placed on a cast iron or tin plate heated to not more than 40°\r\nor 50° C. A gentle heat is quite sufficient to dry the albumen quickly;\r\na greater heat would spoil it, as it would produce coagulation. So soon\r\nas the film is dry, which will be seen by the iridescent aspect it\r\nassumes, the plate is allowed to cool to the ordinary temperature,\r\nand is then at once exposed either beneath a positive, or beneath an\r\noriginal drawing the lines of which have been drawn in opaque ink, so as\r\nto completely prevent the luminous rays from passing through them; the\r\nlight should only penetrate through the white or transparent ground of\r\nthe drawing.\r\n\r\nI say a _positive_ because I wish to obtain an engraved plate; if I\r\nwanted to have a plate for typographic printing, I should have to take a\r\n_negative_. After exposure the plate must be at once developed, which is\r\neffected by dissolving in water those parts of the bichromated gelatine\r\nwhich have been protected from the action of light by the dark spaces\r\nof the cliché; these parts remain soluble, while the others have been\r\nrendered completely insoluble. If the plate were dipped in clear water\r\nit would be difficult to observe the picture coming out, especially on\r\ncopper. To overcome this difficulty the water must be tinged with some\r\naniline color; aniline red or violet, which are soluble in water,\r\nanswers the purpose very well. Enough of the dye must be dissolved in\r\nthe water to give it a tolerably deep color. So soon as the plate is\r\nplunged into this liquid the albumen not acted on by light is dissolved,\r\nwhile the insoluble parts are colored by absorbing the dye, so that the\r\nmetal is exposed in the lines against a red or violet ground, according\r\nto the color of the dye used.\r\n\r\nWhen the drawing comes out quite perfect, and a complete copy of the\r\noriginal, the plate with the image on it is allowed to dry either of its\r\nown accord, or by submitting it to a gentle heat. So soon as it is dry\r\nit is etched, and this is done by means of a solution of perchloride\r\nof iron in alcohol. Both alcohol and iron perchloride will coagulate\r\nalbumen; their action, therefore, on the image will not be injurious,\r\nsince they will harden the remaining albumen still further. But to get\r\nthe full benefit of this, the alcohol and the iron perchloride must\r\nboth be free from water; it is therefore advisable to use the salt in\r\ncrystals which have been thoroughly dried, and the alcohol of a strength\r\nof 95°.\r\n\r\nThe following is the formula:\r\n\r\n  Perchloride of iron, well dried     50 gr.\r\n  Alcohol at 95°                     100 \"\r\n\r\nThis solution must be carefully filtered so as to get rid of any deposit\r\nwhich may form, and must be preserved in a well-corked bottle, when it\r\nwill keep for a long time. The plate is first coated with a varnish of\r\nbitumen of Judea on the edges (if those parts are not already covered\r\nwith albumen) and on the back, so that the etching liquid can only act\r\non the lines to be engraved. It is then placed, with the side to be\r\nengraved downwards, in a porcelain basin, into which a sufficient\r\nquantity of the solution of perchloride of iron is poured, and the\r\nliquid is kept stirred so as to renew the portion which touches the\r\nplate; but care must be taken not to touch with the brush the parts\r\nwhere there is albumen remaining. The length of time that the etching\r\nmust be continued depends on the depth required to be given to\r\nthe engraving; generally a quarter of an hour will be found to be\r\nsufficient. Should it be thought desirable to extend the action over\r\nhalf an hour, the lines will be found to have been very deeply engraved.\r\nWhen the etching is considered to have been pushed far enough, the plate\r\nmust be withdrawn from the solution, and washed in plenty of water;\r\nit must then be forcibly rubbed with a cloth so as to remove all the\r\nalbumen, and after it has been polished with a little pumice, the\r\nengraving is complete.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this process may be used with advantage instead of\r\nthat of photo-engraving with bitumen, in cases where it is not advisable\r\nto use acids. One of my friends, Mr. Fisch, suggests the plan--which\r\nseems to deserve a careful investigation--of combining this process\r\nwith that where bitumen is employed; it would be done somewhat in the\r\nfollowing way. The plate of metal would be first coated evenly with\r\nbitumen of Judea on the turning table, and when the bitumen is quite\r\ndry, it should be again coated with albumen in the manner as described\r\nabove. In full sunlight the exposure need not exceed a minute in length;\r\nthen the plate would be laid in colored water, dried, and immersed in\r\nspirits of turpentine. The latter will dissolve the bitumen in all\r\nthe parts where it has been exposed by the removal of the albumen not\r\nrendered insoluble by the action of light. But it remains to be seen\r\nwhether the albumen will not be undermined in this method; therefore,\r\nbefore recommending the process, it ought to be thoroughly studied. The\r\nmetal is now exposed in all the parts that have to be etched, while\r\nall the other parts are protected by a layer of bitumen coated with\r\ncoagulated albumen. Hence we may employ as mordant water acidulated with\r\n3, 4, or 5 per cent. of nitric acid, according as it is required to have\r\nthe plate etched with greater or less vigor.\r\n\r\nBy following the directions above given, any one wishing to adopt the\r\nprocess cannot fail of obtaining good results, One of its greatest\r\nadvantages is that it is within the reach of every one engaged in\r\nprinting operations.--_Photo News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERIDIAN LINE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From Proceedings of the Association of County Surveyors of\r\nOhio, Columbus, January, 1882.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following process has been used by the undersigned for many years.\r\nThe true meridian can thus be found within one minute of arc:\r\n\r\n_Directions_.--Nail a slat to the north side of an upper window--the\r\nhigher the better.

Place a small table or stand about 20 feet south of\r\nthe plumb-bob, and on its south edge stick the small blade of a pocket\r\nknife; place the eye close to the blade, and move the stand so as to\r\nbring the blade, string, and polar star into line. Place the table so\r\nthat the star shall be seen very near the slat in the window. Let this\r\nbe done half an hour before the greatest elongation of the star. Within\r\nfour or five minutes after the first alignment the star will have moved\r\nto the east or west of the string. Slip the table or the knife a little\r\nto one side, and align carefully as before. After a few alignments the\r\nstar will move along the string--down, if the elongation is west; up, if\r\neast. On the first of June the eastern elongation occurs about half-past\r\ntwo in the morning, and as daylight comes on shortly after the\r\nobservation is completed, I prefer that time of year. The time of\r\nmeridian passage or of the elongation can be found in almost any work on\r\nsurveying. Of course the observer should choose a calm night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the transit can be ranged with the knife blade and\r\nstring, and the proper angle turned off to the left, if the elongation\r\nis east; to the right, if west.\r\n\r\nInstead of turning off the angle, as above described, I measure 200 or\r\n300 feet northtward, in the direction of the string, and compute the\r\noffset in feet and inches, set a stake in the ground, and drive a tack\r\nin the usual way.\r\n\r\nSuppose the distance is 250 feet and the angle 1° 40', then the offset\r\nwill be 7,271 feet, or 7 feet 3¼ inches. A minute of arc at the distance\r\nof 250 feet is seven-eighths of an inch; and this is the most accurate\r\nway, for the vernier will not mark so small a space accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLE OF ELONGATION.\r\n\r\nThis should be computed by the surveyor for each observation. The\r\ndistance between the star and the pole is continually diminishing, and\r\non January 1, 1882, was 1° 18' 48\".\r\n\r\nThere is a slight annual variation in the distance. July 1, 1882, it\r\nwill be 1° 19' 20\". If from this latter quantity the observer will\r\nsubtract 16\" for 1883, and the same quantity for each succeeding year\r\nfor the next four or five years, no error so great as one-quarter of a\r\nminute will be made in the position of the meridian as determined in the\r\nsummer months. If winter observations are made, the distance in January\r\nshould be used. The formula for computing the angle of elongation is\r\neasily made by any one understanding spherical trigonometry, and is\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n   R x sin. Polar dist.\r\n  --------------------- = sin. of angle of elongation.\r\n        cos. lat.\r\n\r\nAs an example, suppose the time is July, 1882, and the latitude 40°.\r\nThen the computation being made, the angle will be found to be 1° 43'\r\n34\". A difference of six minutes in the latitude will make less than\r\n10\" difference in the angle, as one can see by trial. Any good State\r\nor county map will give the latitude to within one or two miles--or\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe facts being as here stated, the absurdity of the Ohio law,\r\nconcerning the establishment of county meridians, becomes apparent. The\r\nlongitude has nothing at all to do With the meridian; and a difference\r\nof _six miles_ in latitude makes no appreciable error in the meridian\r\nestablished as here suggested, whereas the statute requires the latitude\r\nwithin _one half a second_, which is _fifty feet_. There are some other\r\nthings, besides the ways of Providence, which may be said to be \"past\r\nfinding out.\" It is not probable that a surveyor would err so much as\r\n_three_ miles in his latitude, but should he do so, then the error in\r\nhis meridian line, resulting from the mistake, will be _five seconds_,\r\nand a line _one mile_ long, run on a course 5\" out of the way, will vary\r\nbut _an inch and a half_ from the true position. Surveyors well know\r\nthat no such accuracy is attainable. R. W. McFARLAND,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MANIA.\r\n\r\nBy W. MATTIEU WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA history of electricity, in order to be complete, must include two\r\ndistinct and very different subjects: the history of electrical science,\r\nand a history of electrical exaggerations and delusions. The progress of\r\nthe first has been followed by a crop of the second from the time when\r\nKleist, Muschenbroek, and Cuneus endeavored to bottle the supposed\r\nfluid, and in the course of these attempts stumbled upon the \"Leyden\r\njar.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lieberkuhn, of Berlin, describes the startling results which he\r\nobtained, or imagined, \"when a nail or a piece of brass wire is put into\r\na small apothecary's phial and electrified.\" He says that \"if, while it\r\nis electrifying, I put my finger or a piece of gold which I hold in my\r\nhand to the nail, I receive a shock which stuns my arms and shoulders.\"\r\nAt about the same date (the middle of the last century), Muschenbroek\r\nstated, in a letter to Réaumur, that, on taking a shock from a thin\r\nglass bowl, \"he felt himself struck in his arms, shoulders, and breast,\r\nso that he lost his breath, and was two days before he recovered from\r\nthe effects of the blow and the terror\" and that he \"would not take a\r\nsecond shock for the kingdom of France.\" From the description Of the\r\napparatus, it is evident that this dreadful shock was no stronger than\r\nmany of us have taken scores of times for fun, and have given to\r\nour school-follows when we became the proud possessors of our first\r\nelectrical machine.\r\n\r\nConjurers, mountebanks, itinerant quacks, and other adventurers operated\r\nthroughout Europe, and were found at every country fair and _fete_\r\ndisplaying the wonders of the invisible agent by giving shocks and\r\nprofessing to cure all imaginable ailments.\r\n\r\nThen came the discoveries of Galvani and Volta, followed by the\r\ndemonstrations of Galvani's nephew Aldini, whereby dead animals were\r\nmade to display the movements of life, not only by the electricity of\r\nthe Voltaic pile, but, as Aldini especially showed, by a transfer of\r\nthis mysterious agency from one animal to another.\r\n\r\nAccording to his experiments (that seem to be forgotten by modern\r\nelectricians) the galvanometer of the period, a prepared frog, could be\r\nmade to kick by connecting its nerve and muscle with muscle and nerve of\r\na recently killed ox, with, or without metallic intervention.\r\n\r\nThus arose the dogma which still survives in the advertisements of\r\nelectrical quacks, that \"electricity is life,\" and the possibility of\r\nreviving the dead was believed by many. Executed criminals were in\r\nactive demand; their bodies were expeditiously transferred from the\r\ngallows or scaffold to the operating table, and their dead limbs were\r\nmade to struggle and plunge, their eyeballs to roll, and their features\r\nto perpetrate the most horrible contortions by connecting nerves with\r\none pole, and muscles with the opposite pole of a battery.\r\n\r\nThe heart was made to beat, and many men of eminence supposed that if\r\nthis could be combined with artificial respiration, and kept up for\r\nawhile, the victim of the hangman might be restored, provided the neck\r\nwas not broken. Curious tales were loudly whispered concerning gentle\r\nhangings and strange doings at Dr. Brookes's, in Leicester Square, and\r\nat the Hunterian Museum, in Windmill Street, now flourishing as \"The\r\nCafé de l'Etoile.\" When a child, I lived about midway between these\r\ncelebrated schools of practical anatomy, and well remember the tales of\r\nhorror that were recounted concerning them. When Bishop and Williams (no\r\nrelation to the writer) were hanged for burking, i.e., murdering people\r\nin order to provide \"subjects\" for dissection, their bodies were sent to\r\nWindmill Street, and the popular notion was that, being old and faithful\r\nservants of the doctors, they were galvanized to life, and again set up\r\nin their old business.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read some of the treatises on medical galvanism that\r\nwere published at about this period, and contrast their positive\r\nstatements of cures effected and results anticipated with the position\r\nnow attained by electricity as a curative agent.\r\n\r\nThen came the brilliant discoveries of Faraday, Ampère, etc.,\r\ndemonstrating the relations between electricity and magnetism, and\r\nimmediately following them a multitude of patents for electro-motors,\r\nand wild dreams of superseding steam-engines by magneto-electric\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe following, which I copy from the _Penny Mechanic_, of June 10, 1837,\r\nis curious, and very instructive to those who think of investing in any\r\nof the electric power companies of to-day: \"Mr. Thomas Davenport, a\r\nVermont blacksmith, has discovered a mode of applying magnetic and\r\nelectro-magnetic power, which we have good ground for believing will be\r\nof immense importance to the world.\" This announcement is followed by\r\nreference to Professor Silliman's _American Journal of Science and the\r\nArts_, for April, 1837, and extracts from American papers, of which the\r\nfollowing is a specimen: \"1. We saw a small cylindrical battery, about\r\nnine inches in length, three or four in diameter, produce a magnetic\r\npower of about 300 lb., and which, therefore, we could not move with\r\nour utmost strength. 2. We saw a small wheel, five-and-a-half inches in\r\ndiameter, performing more than 600 revolutions in a minute, and lift a\r\nweight of 24 lb. one foot per minute, from the power of a battery of\r\nstill smaller dimensions. 3. We saw a model of a locomotive engine\r\ntraveling on a circular railroad with immense velocity, and rapidly\r\nascending an inclined plane of far greater elevation than any hitherto\r\nascended by steam-power. And these and various other experiments which\r\nwe saw, convinced us of the truth of the opinion expressed by Professors\r\nSilliman, Renwick, and others, that the power of machinery may be\r\nincreased from this source beyond any assignable limit. It is computed\r\nby these learned men that a circular galvanic battery about three feet\r\nin diameter, with magnets of a proportionable surface, would produce at\r\nleast a hundred horse-power; and therefore that two such batteries would\r\nbe sufficient to propel ships of the largest class across the Atlantic.\r\nThe only materials required to generate and continue this power for\r\nsuch a voyage would be a few thin sheets of copper and zinc, and a few\r\ngallons of mineral water.\"\r\n\r\nThe Faure accumulator is but a very weak affair compared with this, Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson notwithstanding. To render the date of the above fully\r\nappreciable, I may note that three months later the magazine from which\r\nit is quoted was illustrated with a picture of the London and Birmingham\r\nRailway Station displaying a first-class passenger with a box seat on\r\nthe roof of the carriage, and followed by an account of the trip to\r\nBoxmoor, the first installment of the London and North-Western Railway.\r\nIt tells us that, \"the time of starting having arrived, the doors of\r\nthe carriages are closed, and, by the assistance of the conductors, the\r\ntrain is moved on a short distance toward the first bridge, where it\r\nis met by an engine, which conducts it up the inclined plane as far as\r\nChalk Farm. Between the canal and this spot stands the station-house for\r\nthe engines; here, also, are fixed the engines which are to be employed\r\nin drawing the carriages up the inclined plane from Euston Square, by\r\na rope upwards of a mile in length, the cost of which was upwards of\r\n£400.\" After describing the next change of engines, in the same matter\r\nof course way as the changing of stage-coach horses, the narrative\r\nproceeds to say that \"entering the tunnel from broad daylight to perfect\r\ndarkness has an exceedingly novel effect.\"\r\n\r\nI make these parallel quotations for the benefit of those who imagine\r\nthat electricity is making such vastly greater strides than other\r\nsources of power. I well remember making this journey to Boxmoor, and\r\nfour or five years later traveling on a circular electro-magnetic\r\nrailway. Comparing that electric railway with those now exhibiting,\r\nand comparing the Boxmoor trip with the present work of the London and\r\nNorth-Western Railway, I have no hesitation in affirming that the rate\r\nof progress in electro-locomotion during the last forty years has been\r\nfar smaller than that of steam.\r\n\r\nThe leading fallacy which is urging the electro-maniacs of the present\r\ntime to their ruinous investments is the idea that electro-motors\r\nare novelties, and that electric-lighting is in its infancy; while\r\ngas-lighting is regarded as an old, or mature middle-aged business,\r\nand therefore we are to expect a marvelous growth of the infant and no\r\nfurther progress of the adult.\r\n\r\nThese excited speculators do not appear to be aware of the fact that\r\nelectric-lighting is older than gas-lighting; that Sir Humphry Davy\r\nexhibited the electric light in Albemarle Street, while London was still\r\ndimly lighted by oil-lamps, and long before gas-lighting was attempted\r\nanywhere. The lamp used by Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution, at\r\nthe beginning of the present century, was an arrangement of two\r\ncarbon pencils, between which was formed the \"electric arc\" by the\r\nintensely-vivid incandescence and combustion of the particles of carbon\r\npassing between the solid carbon electrodes. The light exhibited by Davy\r\nwas incomparably more brilliant than anything that has been lately shown\r\neither in London, or Paris, or at Sydenham. His arc was _four inches\r\nin length_, the carbon pencils were four inches apart, and a broad,\r\ndazzling arch of light bridged the whole space between. The modern arc\r\nlights are but pygmies, mere specks, compared with this; a leap of 1/3\r\nor 1/4 inch constituting their maximum achievement.\r\n\r\nComparing the actual progress of gas and electric lighting, the gas has\r\nachieved by far the greater strides; and this is the case even when we\r\ncompare very recent progress.\r\n\r\nThe improvements connected with gas-making have been steadily\r\nprogressive; scarcely a year has passed from the date of Murdoch's\r\nefforts to the present time, without some or many decided steps having\r\nbeen made. The progress of electric-lighting has been a series of\r\nspasmodic leaps, backward as well as forward.\r\n\r\nAs an example of stepping backward, I may refer to what the newspapers\r\nhave described as the \"discoveries\" of Mr. Edison, or the use of an\r\nincandescent wire, or stick, or sheet of platinum, or platino-iridium;\r\nor a thread of carbon, of which the \"Swan\" and other modern lights are\r\nrival modifications.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1846 I was engaged in making apparatus and experiments\r\nfor the purpose of turning to practical account \"King's patent electric\r\nlight,\" the actual inventor of which was a young American, named Starr,\r\nwho died in 1847, when about 25 years of age, a victim of overwork\r\nand disappointment in his efforts to perfect this invention and a\r\nmagneto-electric machine, intended to supply the power in accordance\r\nwith some of the \"latest improvements\" of 1881 and 1882.\r\n\r\nI had a share in this venture, and was very enthusiastic until after I\r\nhad become practically acquainted with the subject. We had no difficulty\r\nin obtaining a splendid and perfectly steady light, better than any that\r\nare shown at the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nWe used platinum, and alloys of platinum and iridium, abandoned them as\r\nEdison did more than thirty years later, and then tried a multitude of\r\nforms of carbon, including that which constitutes the last \"discovery\"\r\nof Mr. Edison, viz., burnt cane. Starr tried this on theoretical\r\ngrounds, because cane being coated with silica, he predicted that by\r\ncharring it we should obtain a more compact stick or thread, as the\r\nfusion of the silica would hold the carbon particles together. He\r\nfinally abandoned this and all the rest in favor of the hard deposit of\r\ncarbon which lines the inside of gas-retorts, some specimens of which we\r\nfound to be so hard that we required a lapidary's wheel to cut them into\r\nthe thin sticks.\r\n\r\nOur final wick was a piece of this of square section, and about 1/8 of\r\nan inch across each way. It was mounted between two forceps--one holding\r\neach end, and thus leaving a clear half-inch between. The forceps were\r\nsoldered to platinum wires, one of which passed upward through the top\r\nof the barometer tube, expanded into a lamp glass at its upper part.\r\nThis wire was sealed to the glass as it passed through. The lower wire\r\npassed down the middle of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe tube was filled with mercury and inverted over a cup of mercury.\r\nBeing 30 inches long up to the bottom of the expanded portion, or lamp\r\nglobe, the mercury fell below this and left a Torricellian vacuum there.\r\nOne pole of the battery, or dynamo-machine, was connected with the\r\nmercury in the cup, and the other with the upper wire. The stick of\r\ncarbon glowed brilliantly, and with perfect steadiness.\r\n\r\nI subsequently exhibited this apparatus in the Town-hall of Birmingham,\r\nand many times at the Midland Institute. The only scientific difficulty\r\nconnected with this arrangement was that due to a slight volatilization\r\nof the carbon, and its deposition as a brown film upon the lamp glass;\r\nbut this difficulty is not insuperable.--_Knowledge_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF MAGNETS UPON THE VOLTAIC ARC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of magnets upon the voltaic arc has been known for a long\r\ntime past. Davy even succeeded in influencing the latter powerfully\r\nenough in this way to divide it, and since his time Messrs. Grove and\r\nQuet have studied the effect under different conditions. In 1859, I\r\nmyself undertook numerous researches on this subject, and experimented\r\non the induction spark of the Ruhmkorff coil, the results of these\r\nresearches having been published in the last two editions of my notes on\r\nthe Ruhmkorff apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThese researches were summed up in the journal _La Lumière Electrique_\r\nfor June 15, 1879. Recently, Mr. Pilleux has addressed to us some new\r\nexperiments on the same subject, made on the voltaic arc produced by a\r\nDe Meritens alternating current machine. Naturally, he has found the\r\nsame phenomena that I had made known; but he thinks that these new\r\nresearches are worthy of interest by reason of the nature of the arc in\r\nwhich he experimented, and which, according to him, is of a different\r\nnature from all those on which, up to the present time, experiments have\r\nbeen made. Such a distinction as this, however, merits a discussion.\r\n\r\nWith the induction spark, magnets have an action only on the aureola\r\nwhich accompanies the line of fire of the static discharge; and this\r\naureola, being only a sort of sheath of heated air containing many\r\nparticles of metal derived from the rheophores, represents exactly the\r\nvoltaic arc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nMoreover, although the induced currents developed in the bobbin are\r\nalternately of opposite direction, the galvanometer shows that the\r\ncurrents that traverse the break are of the same direction, and that\r\nthese are direct ones. The reversed currents are, then, arrested during\r\ntheir passage; and, in order to collect them, it becomes necessary to\r\nconsiderably diminish the gaseous pressure of the aeriform conductor\r\ninterposed in the discharge; to increase its conductivity; or to open to\r\nthe current a very resistant metallic derivation. By this latter means,\r\nI have succeeded in isolating, one from the other, in two different\r\ncircuits, the direct induced currents and the reversed induced ones.\r\nAs only direct currents can, in air at a normal pressure, traverse\r\nthe break through which the induction spark passes, the aureola that\r\nsurrounds it may be considered as being exactly in the same conditions\r\nas a voltaic arc, and, consequently, as representing an extensible\r\nconductor traversed by a current flowing in a definite direction. Such\r\na conductor is consequently susceptible of being influenced by all the\r\nexternal reactions that can be exerted upon a current; only, by reason\r\nof its mobility, the conductor may possibly give way to the action\r\nexerted upon the current traversing it, and undergo deformations that\r\nare in relation with the laws of Ampère. It is in this manner that I\r\nhave explained the different forms that the aureola of the induction\r\nspark assumes when it is submitted to the action of a magnet in the\r\ndirection of its axial line, or in that of its equatorial line, or\r\nperpendicular to these latter, or upon the magnetic poles themselves.\r\n\r\nExperiments of a very definite kind have not yet been made as to the\r\nnature of the arc produced by induced currents developed in alternating\r\ncurrent machines; but, from the experiments made with electric candles,\r\nwe are forced to admit that the current reacts as if it were alternately\r\nreversed through the arc, since the carbons are used up to an equal\r\ndegree; and, moreover, Mr. Pilleux's experiments show that effects\r\nanalogous to those of induction coils are produced by the reaction of\r\nmagnets upon the arc. There is, then, here a doubtful point that it\r\nwould be interesting to clear up; and we believe that it is consequently\r\nproper to introduce in this place Mr. Pilleux's note:\r\n\r\n\"Having at my disposal,\" says he, \"a powerful vertical voltaic arc of 12\r\ncentimeters in length, kept up by alternately reversed currents, and one\r\nof the most powerful permanent magnets that Mr. De Meritens employs for\r\nmagneto-electric machines, I have been enabled to make the following\r\nexperiments:\r\n\r\n\"1. When I caused one of the poles of my magnet to slowly approach the\r\nvoltaic arc, I ascertained that, at a distance of 10 centimeters, the\r\narc became flattened so as to assume the appearance of those gas jets\r\ncalled 'butterfly.' The plane of the 'butterfly' was parallel with the\r\npole that I presented, or, in other words, with the section of the\r\nmagnet. At the same time, the arc began to emit a strident noise, which\r\nbecame deafening when the pole of the magnet was brought to within a\r\ndistance of about 2 millimeters. At this moment, the butterfly form\r\nproduced by the arc was _greatly spread out, and reduced to the\r\nthickness of a sheet of paper_; and then it burst with violence, and\r\nprojected to a distance a great number of particles of incandescent\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\n\"2. The magnet employed being a horseshoe one, when I directed it\r\nlaterally so as to present successively, now the north and then the\r\nsouth pole to the arc, the 'butterfly' pivoted upon itself so as not to\r\npresent the same surface to each pole of the magnet.\"\r\n\r\nBy referring to the accompanying figure, which we extract from our note\r\non the Ruhmkorff apparatus, it will be seen that the aureola which\r\ndeveloped as a circular film from right to left at D, on the north pole\r\nof the magnet, N.S. (Fig. 1), projected itself in an opposite direction\r\nat C, upon the south pole, S, of the same magnet; but, between the two\r\npoles, these two contrary actions being obliged to unite, they gave rise\r\nin doing so to a very characteristic helicoid spiral whose direction\r\ndepended upon that of the current of discharge through the aureola,\r\nor upon the polarity of the magnetic poles. On the contrary, when the\r\ndischarge took place in the direction of the equatorial line, as in Fig.\r\n2, the circular film developed itself in the plane of the neutral line\r\nabove or below the line of discharge, according to the direction of the\r\ncurrent and the magnetic polarity of the magnet.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, between Mr. Pilleux's experiments and my own so great an\r\nanalogy that we might draw the deduction therefrom that induced currents\r\nin alternating machines have, like those of the Ruhmkorff coil, a\r\ndefinite direction, which would be that of currents having the greatest\r\ntension, that is to say, that of direct currents. This hypothesis seems\r\nto us the more plausible in that Mr. J. Van Malderem has demonstrated\r\nthat the attraction of solenoids with the currents, not straight,\r\nof magneto-electric machines is almost as great as that of the same\r\nsolenoids with straight currents; and it is very likely that the\r\ndifference which may then exist should be so much the less in proportion\r\nas the induced currents have more tension. We might, then, perhaps\r\nexplain the different effects of the wear of the carbons serving as\r\nrheophores, according as the currents are continuous or alternating, by\r\nthe different calorific effects produced on these carbons, and by the\r\neffects of electric conveyance which are a consequence of the passage of\r\nthe current through the arc.\r\n\r\nWe know that with continuous currents the positive carbon possesses a\r\nmuch higher temperature than the negative, and that its wear is about\r\ntwice greater than that of the latter. But such greater wear of the\r\npositive carbon is especially due to the fact that combustion is greater\r\non it than on the negative, and also to the fact that the carbonaceous\r\nparticles carried along by the current to the positive pole are\r\ndeposited in part upon the other pole. Supposing that these polarities\r\nof the carbons were being constantly alternately reversed, the effects\r\nmight be symmetrical from all quarters, although the only current\r\ntraversing the break were of the same direction; for, admitting that the\r\nreverse currents could not traverse the break, they would exist none the\r\nless for all that, and they might give rise (as has been demonstrated\r\nby Mr. Gaugain with regard to the discharges of the induction spark\r\nintercepted by the insulating plate of a condenser) to return discharges\r\nthrough the generator, which would then have, in the metallic part of\r\nthe circuit, the same direction as the direct currents succeeding,\r\nalthough they had momentarily brought about opposite polarities in the\r\nelectrodes. What might make us suppose such an interpretation of the\r\nphenomenon to have its _raison d'etre_, is that with the induced\r\ncurrents of the Ruhmkorff coil, it is not the positive pole that is\r\nthe hottest, but rather the negative; from whence we might draw the\r\ndeduction that it is not so much the direction of the current that\r\ndetermines the calorific effect in the electrodes, as the conditions of\r\nsuch current with respect to the generator. I should not be\r\nsurprised, then, if, in the arc formed by the alternating currents of\r\nmagneto-electric machines, there should pass only one current of the\r\nsame direction, and which would be the one formed by the superposition\r\nof direct currents, and if the reverse currents should cause return\r\ndischarges in the midst of the generating bobbins at the moment the\r\ndirect currents were generated.--_Th. Du Moncel_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCKMAR'S SECONDARY BATTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inventive genius of the country is now directed to these important\r\naccessories of electric enterprise, and no wonder, for as far as can at\r\npresent be seen, the secret of electric motion lies in these secondary\r\nbatteries. Among other contributions of this kind is the following, by\r\nErnest Volckmar, electrician, Paris:\r\n\r\nThe object of this invention is to render unnecessary the use in\r\nsecondary batteries of a porous pot which creates useless resistance\r\nto the electric current, and to store in an apparatus of comparatively\r\nsmall weight and bulk considerable electric force. To this end two\r\nreticulated or perforated plates of lead of similar proportions are\r\nprepared, and their interstices are filled with granules or filaments of\r\nlead, by preference chemically pure. These plates are then submitted to\r\npressure, and placed together, with strips of nonconducting material\r\ninterposed between them, in a suitable vessel containing a bath of\r\nacidulated water. The plates being connected with wires from an electric\r\ngenerator are brought for a while under the action of the current, to\r\nperoxidize and reduce the whole of the finely divided lead exposed to\r\nthe acidulated water. The secondary battery is then complete. It will be\r\nunderstood that any number of these pairs of plates may be combined to\r\nform a secondary battery, their number being determined by the amount\r\nof storage required. The perforated plates of lead may be prepared by\r\ndrilling, casting, or in other convenient manner, but the apertures, of\r\nwhatever form, should be placed as closely together as possible, and\r\nthe finely divided lead to be peroxidized is pressed into the cells or\r\ncavities so as to fill their interiors only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERALOGICAL LOCALITIES IN AND AROUND NEW YORK CITY, AND THE\r\nMINERALS OCCURRING THEREIN.\r\n\r\nBy NELSON H. DARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be many persons in the city of New York and its suburbs who\r\nwill not have the time or facilities for leaving town during the summer,\r\nto spend a part of their time enjoying the country, but would have\r\nsufficient time to take occasional recreation for short periods. I have\r\nsought by this paper to show a pleasurable, and at the same time very\r\ninstructive use for the time of this latter class, and that is in\r\nmineralogy. In the surrounding parts of New York are many mineralogical\r\nlocalities, known to no others than a few professional mineralogists,\r\netc., and from which an excellent assortment of minerals may be\r\nobtained, which would well grace a cabinet and afford considerable\r\ninstruction and entertainment to their owner and friends, besides acting\r\nas an incentive to a further study of this and the other sciences. These\r\nlocalities which I will discuss are all within an hour's ride from New\r\nYork, and the expenses inside of a half dollar, and generally very much\r\nless. I could detail many other places further off, but will reserve\r\nthat for another paper.\r\n\r\nThe course which I will pursue in my explanations I have purposely made\r\nvery simple, avoiding--or when using, explaining--all technical terms.\r\nThe apparatus and tests noticed are of the most rudimentary style\r\nconsistent with that which is necessary to attain the simple purpose of\r\ndistinguishment, and altogether I have prepared this paper for those\r\nhaving at the present time little or no knowledge or practice in\r\nmineralogy, while those having it can be led perhaps by the details of\r\nthe localities noticed. Another reason why I have written so in detail\r\nof this last subject is, because the experiences of most amateur\r\nmineralogists are generally so very discouraging in their endeavors to\r\nfind the minerals, and there is everything in giving a good start\r\nto properly fix the interest on the subject. The reason of these\r\ndiscouragements is simple, and generally because they do not know the\r\nportion of the locality, say, for instance, a certain township, in which\r\nthe minerals occur. And if they do succeed in finding this, it is seldom\r\nthat the portion in which the mineral occurs, which is generally some\r\nsmall inconspicuous vein or fissure, is found; and even in this it\r\nis generally difficult to recognize and isolate the mineral from the\r\nextraneous matter holding it. As an instance of this I might cite thus:\r\nDana, in his text book on mineralogy, will mention the locality for\r\na certain species, as Bergen Hill--say for this instance, dogtooth\r\ncalespar. When we consider that Bergen Hill, in the limited sense of the\r\nexpression, is ten miles long and fully one mile wide, and as the rock\r\noutcrops nearly all over it, and it is also covered with quarries,\r\ncuttings, etc., it may be seen that this direction is rather indefinite.\r\nTo the professional mineralogist it is but an index, however, and he\r\nmay consult the authority it is quoted from--the _American Journal of\r\nScience_, etc.--and thus find the part referred to, or by consulting\r\nother mineralogists who happen to know. Again, the person having found\r\nby inquiry that the part referred to is the Pennsylvania Railroad, and\r\nas this is fully a mile long and interspersed with various prominent\r\nlooking, but veins of a mineral of little value, at any rate not the one\r\nin question, they are few who could suppose that it occurred in that.\r\nApparently a vein of it would not be noticed at all from the surrounding\r\nrock of gravelly earth, but there it is, and in a vein of chlorite. This\r\nis so throughout the long and more or less complete stated lists of\r\nmineralogical localities. Thus I will, in describing the mineral, after\r\nexplaining the conditions under which it occurs, give almost the\r\nexact spot where I have found the same mineral myself, and have left\r\nsufficiently fine specimens to carry away, and thus no time will be lost\r\nin going over fruitless ground, and further, this paper is written up to\r\nthe date given at its end, insuring a necessary presence of them.\r\n\r\nIn order that one not familiar with mineral specimens should not carry\r\noff from the various localities a variety of worthless stones, etc.,\r\nwhich are frequently more or less attractive to an inexperienced eye,\r\nthe following hints may be salutary.\r\n\r\nThere are the varieties of three minerals, which are very commonly met\r\nwith in greater or less abundance in mineralogical trips: they are of\r\ncalcite, steatite, and quartz. They occur in so many modifications of\r\nform, color, and condition that one might speedily form a cabinet of\r\nthese, if they were taken when met with, and imagine it to be of great\r\nvalue. The first of these is calcite. It occurs as marble, limestone;\r\ncalcspar, dogtooth spar, nail head spar, stalactites, and a number of\r\nother forms, which are only valuable when occurring in perfect crystals\r\nor uniquely set upon the rock holding it. The calcspar is extremely\r\nabundant at Bergen Hill, where it might be mistaken for many of the\r\nother minerals which I describe as occurring there, and even in\r\npreference to them, to one's great chagrin upon arriving home and\r\ntesting it, to find that it is nothing but calcite. In order to avoid\r\nthis and distinguish this mineral on the field, it should be tested with\r\na single drop of acid, which on coming in contact with it bubbles up or\r\neffervesces like soda water, seidlitz powder, etc., while it does not do\r\nso with any of the minerals occurring in the same locality. This acid\r\nis prepared for use as follows: about twenty drops of muriatic acid are\r\nprocured from a druggist in a half-ounce bottle, which is then filled up\r\nwith water and kept tightly corked. It is applied by taking a drop out\r\non a wisp of broom or a small minim dropper, which may be obtained at\r\nthe druggist's also. I do not say that in every case this mineral should\r\nbe rejected, because it is frequently very beautiful and worthy of place\r\nin a cabinet, but should be kept only under the conditions mentioned\r\nfurther on in this paper, under the head of \"Calcite in Weehawken\r\nTunnel.\"\r\n\r\nThe next mineral abundant in so many forms is quartz, and is not so\r\nreadily distinguished as calcite. It is found of every color, shape,\r\netc., possible, and that which is found in any of the localities I am\r\nabout to describe, with the exception of fine crystals on Staten Island,\r\nare of no value and may be rejected, unless answering in detail to the\r\ndescription given under Staten Island. The method of distinguishing the\r\nquartz is by its hardness, which is generally so great that it cannot be\r\nscratched by the point of a knife, or at least with great difficulty,\r\nand a fragment of it will scratch glass readily; thus it is\r\ndistinguished from the other minerals occurring in the localities\r\ndiscussed in this paper.\r\n\r\nThe other minerals so common are the varieties of steatite. This is\r\nespecially so at Bergen Hill and Staten Island. They occur in amorphous\r\nmasses generally, and may be distinguished by being so soft as to be\r\nreadily cut by the finger nail. I will detail further upon the soapstone\r\nforms in discussing the localities on Staten Island, and the chloritic\r\nform under the head of \"Weehawken Tunnel.\" The surest method of avoiding\r\nthese and recognizing the others by their appearance, which is generally\r\nthe only guide used by a professional mineralogist, is to copy off the\r\nlists of the various minerals I describe, and, by visiting the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History on any week day except Mondays and Tuesdays,\r\none may see and become familiar with the minerals they are going\r\nin quest of, besides others in the cases. This method is much more\r\nsatisfactory than printed descriptions, and saves the labor of many of\r\nthe distinguishing manipulations I am about to describe, besides saving\r\nthe trouble of bringing inferior specimens of the minerals home.\r\n\r\nIn going forth on a trip one should be provided with a mineralogical\r\nhammer, or one answering its purpose, and a cold chisel with which to\r\ndetach or trim the minerals from adhering rocks, the bottle of acid\r\nbefore referred to, and a three cornered file for testing hardness,\r\nas explained further on. As I noticed before, the better plan of\r\ndistinguishing a mineral is by being familiar with its appearance, but\r\nas this is generally impracticable, I will detail the modes used in\r\nlieu of this to be applied on bringing the minerals home. These\r\ndistinguishments depend on difference in specific gravity, hardness,\r\nsolubility in hot acids, and the action of high heat. I will explain the\r\napplication of each one separately, commencing with--\r\n\r\n_The Specific Gravity_.--In ascertaining the specific gravity the\r\nfollowing apparatus is necessary: a small pair of hand scales with a set\r\nof weights, from one grain to one ounce. These can be procured from the\r\napparatus maker, the scales for about fifty cents, and the weights for\r\nnot much over the same amount. The scales are prepared for this work by\r\ncutting two small holes in one of the scale pans, near together, with\r\na pointed piece of metal, and tying a piece of silk thread about eight\r\ninches long into these. In a loop at the end of this thread the mineral\r\nto be examined is suspended. It should be a pure representative of the\r\nmineral it is taken from, should weigh about from one hundred grains to\r\nan ounce, and be quite dry and free from dirt. If the piece of mineral\r\nobtained is very large, this sized portion may be often taken from it\r\nwithout injury; but it will not do to mar the beauty of a mineral to\r\nascertain its specific gravity, and it is generally only applicable\r\nwhen a small piece is at hand. With more weights, however, a piece of a\r\nquarter pound weight may be taken if necessary. The mineral is tied into\r\nthe loop and weighed, the weight being set down in the note book, either\r\nin grains or decimal parts of an ounce. Call this result A. It is then\r\nweighed in some water held in a vessel containing about a quart, taking\r\ncare while weighing it that it is entirely immersed, but at the same\r\ntime does not touch either the sides or bottom. Both weighings should\r\nbe accurate to a grain. This result we call B. The specific gravity is\r\nfound by subtracting B from A, and dividing A by the remainder. For\r\ninstance, if the mineral weighed eight hundred grains when weighed in\r\nthe air, and in the water six hundred, giving us the equation: 800\r\n/ (800 - 600) = sp. gr., or 4, which is the specific gravity of\r\nthe mineral. If the mineral whose specific gravity is sought is an\r\nincrustation on a rock, or a mixture of a number of minerals, or would\r\nbreak to pieces in the water, the specific gravity is by this method of\r\ncourse unattainable, and other data must be used.\r\n\r\n_The Comparative Hardness_.--The next characteristic of the mineral to\r\nbe ascertained is the comparative hardness. In mineralogy there is a\r\nscale fixed for comparison, from 1 to 10, 10 being the hardest, the\r\ndiamond, and Number 1 the soft soapstone. These and the intermediate\r\nminerals fixed upon the scale are generally inaccessible to those who\r\nmay use the contents of this paper, and I will give some more familiar\r\nmaterials for comparison. 8, 9, and 10 are the topaz, sapphire, and\r\ndiamond respectively, and as these and minerals of similar hardness will\r\nprobably not be found in any of the localities of which I make mention,\r\nwe need not become accustomed to them for the present. 7 is of\r\nsufficient hardness to scratch glass, and is also not to be cut with the\r\nfile before mentioned, which is used for these determinations. 6 is\r\nof the hardness of ordinary French glass. 5 is about the hardness of\r\nhorse-shoe or similar iron; 4 of the brown stone (sandstone) of which\r\nthe fronts of many city buildings, etc., are built; 3 of marble; 2 of\r\nalabaster; and 1 as French chalk, or so soft as to be readily cut with\r\nthe finger nail. The method of using and applying these comparisons is\r\nby having the above matters at hand, and compare them by the relative\r\nease with which they can be cut by running the edge of the file over\r\ntheir surface. One will soon become familiar with the scale, and it\r\nmay of course then be discarded. As it is one of the most important\r\ncharacteristics of some of the minerals, it should be carefully\r\nexecuted, and the result carefully considered. It is of course\r\ninapplicable under those conditions with minerals that are in very small\r\ncrystals or in a fibrous condition.\r\n\r\n_Action of Hot Acids_.--This very important test is never, like the\r\nabove, applicable upon the field, but applied when home is reached.\r\nFrom the body of the mineral as pure and clean as possible a portion is\r\nchipped, about the size of a small pea; this is wrapped in a piece of\r\nstiff wrapping paper, and after placing it in contact with a solid body,\r\ncrushed finally by a blow from the hammer. A pinch of the powder so\r\nobtained is taken up on the point of a penknife, and transferred into\r\na test tube. Two or more of these should be provided, about six inches\r\nlong. They may be obtained in the apparatus shop for a trifle. Some\r\nhydrochloric, or, as it is generally called, muriatic acid, is poured\r\nupon it to the depth of about three quarters of an inch; the tube is\r\nthen placed in some boiling water heated over a lamp in a tinned or\r\nother vessel, and allowed to boil for from ten to fifteen minutes;\r\nthe tube is then removed and its contents allowed to cool, and then\r\nexamined. If the powder has all disappeared, we term the mineral\r\n\"soluble;\" if more or less is dissolved, \"partly soluble;\" if none,\r\n\"insoluble;\" and if the contents of the tube are of a solid transparent\r\nmass like jelly, \"gelatinous;\" while if transparent gelatinous flakes\r\nare left, it is so termed. As this method of distinguishment is always\r\napplicable, it is very important, and its detail and result should be\r\ncarefully noticed. Care should be taken that only a small portion of\r\nthe mineral is used, and also but little acid; the action should be\r\nobserved, and is frequently a characteristic, in the case with calcspar,\r\nwhich effervesces while dissolving. The acid used is hydrochloric at\r\nfirst, and then, if the mineral cannot he recognized, the same treatment\r\nmay be repeated using nitric acid. Both of these acids should be at hand\r\nand two ounces are generally sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Action of Heat_.--This is, perhaps, the most important characteristic,\r\nand, when taken with the preceding data, will identify any of the\r\nminerals found in any one locality, which I will describe, from each\r\nother. The heat is applied to the mineral by means of a candle and\r\nblowpipe. A thick wax candle answers well, and an ordinary japanned tin\r\nblowpipe, costing twenty cents, will serve the purpose. The substance\r\nto be examined is held on a loop of platinum wire about one inch to the\r\nleft and just below the top of the wick, which is bent toward it. Here\r\nit is steadily held, as is shown in Fig. 1, and the flame of the candle\r\nbent over upon it, and the heat intensified by blowing a steady and\r\nstrong current of air across it by means of the blowpipe held in the\r\nmouth and supported by the right hand, whose elbow is resting upon the\r\ntable. The current of air is difficult to keep up by one unaccustomed to\r\nthe blowpipe, the skill of using which is readily obtained; it consists\r\nin breathing through the nostrils, while the air is forced out by\r\npressure on the air held by the inflated cheeks, and not from the lungs.\r\nThis can be practiced while not using the blow-pipe, and may readily\r\nbe accomplished by one's keeping his cheeks distended with air and\r\nbreathing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis heat is steadily applied until the splinter of mineral has been\r\nkept at a high red heat for a sufficient length of time to convince one\r\nof what it may do, as fuse or not, or on the edges. The first two\r\nare evident, as when it fuses it runs into a globule; the last, by\r\ninspecting it before and after the heating with a magnifying glass;\r\nsometimes it froths up when heated, and is then said to \"intumesce;\" or,\r\nif it flies to fragments, \"decrepitates.\" Upon the first it is further\r\nheated; but in the latter case, a new splinter of mineral must be broken\r\noff from the mass and heated upon the wire very cautiously until quite\r\nhot, when it may then be readily heated further without fear of loss.\r\nFor holding the splinter of mineral, which should well represent the\r\nmass and be quite small, is a three-inch length of platinum wire of the\r\nthickness of a cambric-needle; this may be bought for about ten cents at\r\nthe apparatus shop. The ends should be looped, as is shown in Fig. 2,\r\nand the mineral placed in the loop.\r\n\r\nSometimes a mineral has to be fused with borax, as I mention further\r\non in my tables. This is done by heating the wire-loop to redness, and\r\nplunging it into some borax; what adheres is fused upon it by heating.\r\nSome more is accumulated in the same manner, until the loop is filled\r\nwith a fair-sized globule. A small quantity of the mineral, which had\r\nbeen crushed as for the acid test, is caused to adhere to it while it is\r\nmolten, and then the heat of the blast directed upon it for some time\r\nuntil either the small fragments of mineral dissolve, or positively\r\nrefuse to do so. After cooling, the aspect of the globule is noticed as\r\nto color, transparency, etc. Care must be taken that too large an amount\r\nof the mineral is not taken, a very minute amount being sufficient.\r\n\r\nI trust by the use of these distinguishing reactions one will be able\r\nto recognize by the tables to be given the name of the mineral in hand,\r\nespecially as they are from certain parts, where all the minerals\r\noccurring therein are known to us; and I have worded the characteristics\r\nso that they will serve to isolate from all that possibly could be found\r\nin that locality.\r\n\r\nThe first general locality is Bergen Hill, New Jersey. This comprises\r\nthe range of bluffs of trap rock commencing at Bergen Point and running\r\nup behind Jersey City and Hoboken, etc., to the part opposite about\r\nThirtieth Street, New York, where it comes close to the river, and from\r\nthere along the river to the north for a long distance, known as the\r\nPalisades. It is about a mile wide on an average, and from a few feet to\r\nabout two hundred feet in height. The mineralogical localities in and\r\nupon it are at the following parts, commencing at the south: First\r\nPennsylvania Railroad cuts where the mining operations are just about\r\ncompleted; then the Erie Tunnel, in which the specimens that first made\r\nBergen Hill noted as a mineralogical locality, and whose equals have not\r\nsince been procured, were found, but which is now inaccessible to the\r\ngeneral public. Further north is the Morris and Essex Tunnel, in which\r\nmany fine specimens were secured, and is also inaccessible; and last,\r\nbut far from being least, is the Ontario Tunnel at Weehawken; and, as\r\nit is the only practicable part besides the Pennsylvania Railroad and a\r\nnumber of surface outcrops which I will mention, I will commence with\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n_The Weehawken Tunnel_--This tunnel is now being cut through the\r\ntrap-rock for the New York, Ontario, and Western Railroad, and will\r\nbe completed in a few months, but will, probably, be available as a\r\nmineralogical locality for a year to come. It is located about half a\r\nmile south of the Weehawken Ferry from Forty-second Street, New York\r\ncity, and the place where to climb upon the hill to get to the shafts\r\nleading to it is made prominent by the large body of light-colored rock\r\non the dump, a few rods north of where the east entrance is to be. The\r\nwestern end is in the village of New Durham, on the New Jersey Northern\r\nRailroad, and recognized by the immense earth excavations. A pass is\r\nnecessary to gain admittance down the shafts, and this can be procured\r\nfrom the office of the company, between the third and fourth shafts to\r\nthe tunnel, in the grocery and provision store just to the north of\r\nthe tramway connecting the shafts on the surface. As it will not be\r\nnecessary to go down in any of the shafts besides the first and second\r\nin order to fulfill the objects of this paper, no difficulty need be\r\nencountered in procuring the pass if this is stated.\r\n\r\nThese two shafts are about eight hundred feet apart and one hundred and\r\nseventy feet deep. A platform elevator is the mode of access to the\r\ntunneled portion below, and a free shower-bath is included in the\r\ndescent; consequently, a rubber-coat and water tight boots are\r\nnecessary. A pair of overalls should be worn if one is to engage in\r\nany active exploration below; candles should also be provided, as the\r\nelectric lights, at the face of the headings, give but little light, and\r\nremind one very forcibly of a dim flash light with a foliaged tree in\r\nfront of it. The electric wires for supplying these arrangements run\r\nalong the north side of the tunnel for those on the east headings, and\r\non the south side for the west. They are excellent things to keep clear\r\nof, as they have sufficient current passing through them to knock one\r\ndown; thus their position can be readily ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Occurrence of the Minerals_.--In general, the greater number\r\nof the specimens which are to be found in the tunnel occur in veins\r\ngenerally perpendicular, and with other minerals of little or no value,\r\nas calcite, chlorite, and imperfect crystals of the same mineral. A\r\nfew occur in nodules inclosed in the solid body of rock, and in which\r\ncondition they are seldom of value. The greater abundance are in the\r\nveins of the dark-green soft chlorite, and some few in horizontal beds.\r\nThe minerals are found in the first condition by examining all the veins\r\nrunning from floor to ceiling of the tunnel. The ores of calcite first\r\nmentioned are very conspicuous, they being white in the dense black\r\nrock. They may be chipped from, as there are about thirty or forty of\r\nthem exposed in each shaft, and the character of the minerals examined\r\nto see if anything but calcite is in it. This is ascertained by a drop\r\nof acid, as explained before, and by the descriptions given further on.\r\nThe veins of chlorite are not so conspicuous, being of a dark-green\r\ncolor; but by probing along the walls with a stick or hammer, they may\r\nbe recognized by their softness, or by its dull glistening appearance.\r\nThey are comparatively few, but from an inch to three feet wide; and\r\nminerals are found by digging it out with a stick or a three-foot drill,\r\nto be had at the headings. Where the most minerals occur in the chlorite\r\nis when plenty of veins of calcite are in its vicinity, and its edges\r\nnear the trap are dry and crumbly. It is here where the minerals are\r\nfound in this crumbly chlorite, and generally in geodes--that is, the\r\nfaces of the minerals all point inward, formerly a spherical mass--rough\r\nand uncouth on the outside, and from half an inch to nearly a foot in\r\ndiameter. These are valuable finds, and well worth digging for. The beds\r\nof minerals generally are of but one species, and will be mentioned\r\nunder the head of the minerals occurring in them. Besides, in the tunnel\r\nthere are generally more or less perfect minerals upon the main dump\r\nover the edge of the bluff toward the river. Here many specimens that\r\nhave escaped the eyes of the miners may be found among the loose rock,\r\nbeing constantly strewn out by the incline of the bed; in fact, this is\r\nthe only place in which quite a number of the incident minerals may be\r\nfound; but I will not linger longer on this, as I shall refer to it\r\nunder the minerals individually.\r\n\r\nThe minerals occurring at the tunnel are as follows, with their\r\ndescriptions and locations in the order of their greatest abundance:\r\n\r\n_Calcite_.--This mineral occurs in great abundance in and about the\r\ntunnel, and from all the shafts. There are two forms occurring there,\r\nthe most abundant of which is the rhombohedral, after Fig. 3. It can\r\ngenerally be obtained, however, in excellent crystals, which, although\r\nperfect in form, are opaque, but often large and beautiful. It is always\r\npacked with a thousand or its multiple of other crystals into veins of a\r\nfew inches thick; and crystals are obtained by carefully breaking with\r\nedge of the cold chisel these masses down to the fundamental form shown.\r\nAs the masses are never secured by the miners, they can always be picked\r\nfrom the piles of _débris_ around the shafts and the dumps, and afford\r\nsome little instruction as to the manner in which a mineral is built up\r\nby crystallization, and may be subdivided by cleavage to a crystal of\r\nthe same shape exactly, but infinitesimally small. A crystal to be worth\r\npreserving should be about an inch in diameter, and as transparent as is\r\nattainable.\r\n\r\nAnother form of calcite which is to be sparingly found is what is called\r\ndogtooth spar, having the form shown in Fig. 4. They occur in clear\r\nwine-yellow-colored crystals, from a quarter to half an inch in length;\r\nthey occur in the chlorite in geodes of variable sizes, but generally\r\ntwo and a half inches in diameter, and which, when carefully broken in\r\nhalf, showed beautiful grottoes of these crystals. The few of these that\r\nI have found were in the four-foot vein of chlorite down the Shaft No.\r\n1, to the west of the shaft about one hundred and fifty feet, and on\r\nthe south wall; it may be readily found by probing for it, and then the\r\ngeodes by digging in. There need be no difficulty in finding this vein\r\nif these conditions are carefully considered, or if one of the miners\r\nbe asked as to the soft vein. Both these forms of calcite may be\r\ndistinguished from the other minerals by first effervescing on coming\r\nin contact with the acids; second, by glowing with an intense (almost\r\nunbearably so) light when heated with the blowpipe, but not fusing.\r\nTheir specific gravity is 2.6, or near it, and hardness about 3, or\r\nequal to ordinary unpolished white marble.\r\n\r\n_Natrolite_.--The finest specimens of this mineral that have ever been\r\nfound in Bergen Hill were taken from a bed of it in this tunnel, having\r\nin its original form, before it was cut out by the tunnel passing\r\nthrough, over one hundred square feet, and from one-half to two and a\r\nhalf and even three inches in thickness; it was in all possible shapes\r\nand forms--all extremely rare and beautiful. A large part of one end\r\nof this bed still remains, and, by careful cutting, fine masses may be\r\nobtained. This bed may be readily found; it is nearly horizontal, and in\r\nits center about four feet from the floor of the tunnel, and about half\r\nan inch thick. It is down Shaft No. 2, on the north wall, and commences\r\nabout eighty feet from the shaft. It is cut into in some places, but\r\nthere is plenty more left, and can be obtained by cutting the rock\r\nabove it and easing it out by means of the blade of a knife or similar\r\ninstrument. This natrolite is a grouping of very small but perfect\r\ncrystals, having the forms shown in Fig. 5; they are from a quarter to\r\nan inch long, and, if not perfectly transparent, are of a pure white\r\ncolor; they may be readily recognized by their form, and occurring in\r\nthis bed. Its hardness, which is seldom to be ascertained owing to the\r\ndelicacy of the crystals, is about 5, and the specific gravity 2.2.\r\nThis is readily found, but is no distinction; its reaction before the\r\nblowpipe, however, is characteristic, it readily fusing to a transparent\r\nglobule, clear and glassy, and by forming a jelly when heated with\r\nacids. The bed holding the upright crystals is also natrolite in\r\nconfused matted masses. This mineral has also been found in other parts\r\nof the shaft, but only in small druses. There is a prospect at present\r\nthat another bed will be uncovered soon, and some more fine specimens to\r\nbe easily obtained.\r\n\r\n_Pectolite_, or as it is termed by the miners, \"silky spar.\"--This\r\nmineral is quite abundant and in fine masses, not of the great beauty\r\nand size of those taken from the Erie Tunnel, but still of great\r\nuniqueness. The mineral is recognized by its peculiar appearance, as\r\nis shown in Fig. 6, where it may be seen that it is in groups of\r\nfine delicate fibers about an inch long, diverging from a point into\r\nfan-shaped groups. The fibers are very tightly packed together, as are\r\nalso the groups; they are very tough individually, and have a hardness\r\nof 4, and a specific gravity of about 2.5. It gelatinizes on boiling\r\nwith acid, and a fragment may be readily fused in the blowpipe flame,\r\nyielding a transparent globule. The appearance is the most striking\r\ncharacteristic, and at once distinguishes this mineral from any of the\r\nothers occurring in this locality. Considerable quantities of pectolite\r\nmay generally be found on the dump, but also in Shaft No. 1, and\r\nespecially No. 2. The veins of it are difficult to distinguish from the\r\ncalcite, as they are almost identical in color, and many of the calcite\r\nveins are partly of pectolite--in fact, every third or fourth vein will\r\ncontain more or less of it. There is, however, a very fine vein of\r\npectolite about twenty-five feet further east from the natrolite bed; it\r\nruns from the floor to ceiling, and is about two inches in thickness;\r\nsome specimens of which I took from these were unusually unique in both\r\nsize and appearance. It makes a very handsome specimen for the cabinet,\r\nand should be carefully trimmed to show the characteristics of the\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\n_Datholite_.--This mineral has been found very frequently in the tunnel,\r\nit occurring in pockets in the softer trap near the chlorite, and also\r\nin the latter, generally at a depth of one hundred and fifty feet from\r\nthe surface, and consequently near the ceiling of the tunnel. All that\r\nhas been found of any great beauty has been in the western end of the\r\nShaft No. 1 and the eastern of Shaft No. 2, where the trap is quite\r\nsoft; here it is found nearly every day in greater or less quantity, and\r\nfrom this some may generally be found on the dump, or, in the vein\r\nof chlorite which I mentioned as a locality for the dogtooth spar,\r\nconsiderable may be obtained in it and on its western edge near the\r\nceiling. A ladder about thirteen feet long is used for attending the\r\nlights, and may generally be borrowed, and access to the remainder\r\nof this pocket thus gained. Datholite is also very characteristic in\r\nappearance, and can only be confounded with some forms of calcite\r\noccurring near it. It occurs in small glassy, nearly globular crystals;\r\nthey are generally not over three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, and\r\ngenerally pure and perfectly transparent, having a hardness of a little\r\nover 5, and specific gravity of 3; as it generally occurs as a druse\r\nupon the trap, or an apopholite, calcite, etc., this is seldom\r\nattainable, however, and we have a very distinctive characteristic in\r\nanother test: this is the blowpipe, under which it at first intumesces\r\nand then fuses to a transparent globule, and the flame, after playing\r\nupon it, is of a deep green color. Nitric acid must be used to boil it\r\nup with, and with it it may be readily gelatinized. This last test will\r\nseldom be necessary, however, and may be dispensed with if the hardness\r\nand blowpipe reactions may be ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Apopholite_.--This beautiful mineral has been found in fair abundance\r\nat times in Shafts No. 1 and 2 in pockets, and seldom in place, most of\r\nit being taken from the loose stone at the mouth of the shaft, and it\r\nmay generally be found on the dump. It is readily mistaken for calcite\r\nby the miners and those unskilled in mineralogy, but a drop of acid will\r\nquickly show the difference. The sizes of the crystals are very various,\r\nfrom an eighth of an inch long or thick, to, in one case, an inch and\r\na half. The colors have been varied from white to nearly all tints,\r\nincluding pink, purple, blue, and green; the white variety is, however,\r\nthe most abundant, and makes a handsome cabinet specimen. The crystals\r\nare generally packed together in a mass, but are frequently set apart as\r\nheavy druses of crystals having the form shown in Fig. 7. Sometimes,\r\nas in the former grouping, the crystals are without the pyramidal\r\nterminations, and are then right square prisms. The fracture being at\r\nperfect right angles, distinguishes it from calcite. Its hardness is\r\ngenerally fully 5, the specific gravity between 2.4 and 2.5; it is\r\ndifficult to fuse before the blowpipe, but is finally fused into an\r\nopaque globule. Upon heating with nitric acid it partly dissolves, and\r\nthe remainder becomes flaky and gelatinous. Apopholite, although quite\r\nrare, now may be bought from the men, or at least one of the engineers\r\nof Shaft No. 2's elevator, and generally at low terms.\r\n\r\n_Phrenite_.--This mineral is quite abundant in Shafts No. 1 and 2, in\r\nvery small masses, incrustations, and even in small crystals. It\r\noccurs embedded in or incrusting the trap, and also with calcite and\r\napopholite. The only sure place to find it is at the southwest side of\r\nan opening through the pile of drift rock under the trestle work of the\r\ntramway, between shaft No. 1 and the dump, and within a few feet of a\r\nnumber of wooden vats sunk into the ground seen just before descending\r\nthe hills and near the edge. Here on a number of blocks of trap it may\r\nbe found, a greenish white incrustation about as thick as a knife blade;\r\nit also may be found on the main dump, and is sometimes found in plates\r\none-eighth of an inch thick, of a darker green color, upon calcite. Its\r\neasiest distinguishment from the other minerals of this locality, with\r\nwhich it might be confounded, is its great hardness of from 6 to 7.\r\nIt is very fragile and brittle, however, and is never perfectly\r\ntransparent, but quite opaque; its specific gravity is 2.9, and it is\r\nreadily fused before the blowpipe after intumescing. It partly dissolves\r\nin acid without gelatinizing, leaving a flaky residue; it is a beautiful\r\nmineral when in masses or crystals of a dark green color, but the best\r\nplace in the vicinity to secure specimens of this kind is, as I will\r\ndetail hereafter, at Paterson, N. J.\r\n\r\n_Iron and Copper Pyrites_.--Both of these common but frequently\r\nbeautiful minerals occur in the tunnel and adjacent rocks in great\r\nabundance. The crystals are generally about one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and groups of these may be frequently obtained on the dump in\r\nthe shafts, especially No. 1 and 2, and where the rock is being cleared\r\naway for the eastern entrance to the tunnel. They resemble each other\r\nvery much; the iron pyrites, however, is in cubical forms and having the\r\ngreat hardness of from 6 to 7, while the copper pyrites, less abundant\r\nand in forms having triangles for bases, but having sometimes other\r\nforms and a hardness of but 3 to 4. Both are similar in aspect to a\r\npiece of brass, and cannot be mistaken for any other mineral. The form\r\nof the copper pyrites is shown in Fig. 8; the iron is, as before noted,\r\nin cubes, more or less modified.\r\n\r\n_Stilbite_.--Small quantities of this beautiful mineral have been found\r\nin Shaft No. 2, in a small bed of but a few square feet in area, but\r\nquite thick and appearing much like natrolite. This bed was about one\r\nhundred feet east from Shaft No. 2, and in the center of the heading\r\nwhen it was at that point. It has been encountered since in small\r\nquantities, and it would do well to look out for it in the fresh\r\ntunneled portion after the date appended to this paper. It generally\r\noccurs in the form shown in Fig. 9, grouped very similarly to natrolite,\r\nand being right upon the rock or a thin bed of itself. The crystals are\r\ngenerally half an inch long, but often less. The modifications of the\r\nabove form, which are frequent in this species, strike one forcibly of\r\nthe resemblance they bear to a broad stone spear head on a diminutive\r\nscale, with a blunted edge; their hardness is about 4, specific gravity\r\n2.2, the color generally a pearly white or grayish. After a long\r\nboiling with nitric acid it gelatinizes, but it foams up and fuses to a\r\ntransparent glass before the blowpipe. A little stilbite may often be\r\nfound on the dumps.\r\n\r\n_Laumonite_ occurs in very small quantities on calcite or apopholite,\r\nand can hardly be expected to be found on the trip; but as it might be\r\nfound, I will detail some of its characteristics. Hardness 4, specific\r\ngravity 2.3; it generally occurs in small crystals, but more frequently\r\nin a crumbly, chalky mass, which it becomes upon exposure to the air.\r\nThe crystals are generally transparent and frequently tinged yellow in\r\ncolor. It gelatinizes by boiling with acid, and after intumescing before\r\nthe blowpipe, fuses to a frothy mass. To keep this mineral when in\r\ncrystals from crumbling upon exposure it may be dipped in a thin mastic\r\nvarnish or in a gum-arabic solution.\r\n\r\n_Heulandite_.--This rare mineral has been found under the same\r\nconditions as laumonite in Shaft No. 2, but it is seldom to be met with,\r\nand then in small crystals. It is of a pure white color, sometimes\r\ntransparent. It intumesces and readily fuses before the blowpipe, and\r\ndissolves in acid without gelatinizing. Hardness 4, specific gravity\r\n2.2.\r\n\r\nThe few other minerals occurring in the tunnel are so extremly rare as\r\nnot to be met with by any other than an expert, and it is impossible\r\nto detail the localities, as they generally occur as minute druses or\r\nincrustations upon other minerals with which they may be confounded, and\r\nhave been removed as soon as discovered. The minerals referred to are\r\nanalcime, chabazite, Thompsonite, and finally, the mineral which I first\r\nfound in this formation, Hayesine, which is extremely rare, and of which\r\nI only obtained sufficient to cover a square inch. The particulars in\r\nregard to its locality, etc., maybe found in the _American Journal of\r\nSciences_ for June, page 458. I will now sum up the characteristics of\r\nthese several minerals of this locality in the table:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\n   Name.  |  H. |Sp.|Action of        |Action of        |Color.|Appearance.\r\n          |     |Gr.|Blowpipe.        |hot acid.        |      |\r\n----------+-----+---+-----------------+-----------------+------+---------------\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nCalcite   |  3  |2.6|Infusible,       |Soluble with     |White |Like Fig.\r\n          |     |   |but glows        |effervescence    |      |3 and 4.\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nNatrolite |  5  |2.2|Readily fused    |Forms a jelly    |  do. |Like Fig 5.\r\n          |     |   |to clear globule |                 |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nPectolite |  4  |2.5|      do.        |  do.  do.       |  do. |Divergent\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |fibers, Fig. 6.\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nDatholite |  5  |3.0|Intumesces, fused|Forms a jelly    |Color-|Small, nearly\r\n          |     |   |to clear globule,|                 |less  |spherical, etc.\r\n          |     |   |gives green flame|                 |white |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nApopholite|  5  |2.5|Difficult, fused |Partly soluble   |Tinted|Like Fig. 7.\r\n          |     |   |to opaque globule|in nitric acid   |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nPhrenite  |  6  |2.9|Intomesces, fused|Partly soluble   |Green-|In tables and\r\n          |to 7 |   |to clear globule |in nitric acid,  |ish   |incrustations.\r\n          |     |   |                 |leaving flakes   |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nIron      |  6  |5.0|Burns and yields |                 |Brass |Cubical.\r\npyrites   |to 7 |   |a black globule, |                 |      |\r\n          |     |   |decrepitates     |                 |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nCopper    |  3  |4.2|    do.     do.  |                 |  do. |Tetrahedronal.\r\npyrites   |to 4 |   |                 |                 |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nStilbite  |  4  |2.2|Intumesces and   |Difficult; jelly |White |Like Fig. 8.\r\n          |     |   |fuses readily    |on long boiling  |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |with nitric acid.|      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nLaumonite |  4  |2.3|Intumesces and   |Readily          |  do. |Generally\r\n          |to 0 |   |fuses to frothy  |gelatinizes      |      |chalky.\r\n          |     |   |mass             |                 |      |\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\nHeulandite|  4  |2.2|Intumesces and   |Soluble, no      |  do. |In right\r\n          |     |   |readily fuses    |jelly            |      |rhomboidal\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |prisms.\r\n          |     |   |                 |                 |      |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_To Distinguish the Minerals together the one from the other_.--Calcite\r\nby effervescing on placing a drop of acid upon it. Natrolite resembles\r\nstilbite, but may be distinguished by gelatinizing readily with\r\nhydrochloric acid and by not intumescing when heated before the\r\nblowpipe; from the other minerals by the form of the crystals and their\r\nsetting, also the locality in the tunnel in which it was found.\r\n\r\nPectolite sometimes resembles some of the others, but may be readily\r\ndistinguished by its _tough_ long fibers, not brittle like natrolite.\r\nDatholite may generally be distinguished by the form of its crystals and\r\ntheir glassy appearance, with great hardness, and by tingeing the flame\r\nfrom the blowpipe of a true green color. Apopholite is distinguished\r\nfrom calcite, as noticed under that species, and from the others by its\r\nform, difficult fusibility, and part solubility.\r\n\r\nPhrenite is characterized by its hardness, greenish color, occurrence,\r\nand action of acid. Iron pyrites is always known by its brassy metallic\r\naspect and great hardness. Copper pyrites, by its aspect from the other\r\nminerals, and from iron pyrites by its inferior hardness and less\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nStilbite is characterized by its form, difficult gelatinizing, and\r\nintumescence before the blowpipe; from natrolite as mentioned under that\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nLaumonite is known by its generally chalky appearance and a probable\r\nfailure in finding it.\r\n\r\nHeulandite is distinguished from stilbite by its crystals and perfect\r\nsolubility; from apopholite by form of crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the next part of this paper I will commence with Staten Island.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1882.

WOOD, Member of the Civil Engineers' Club, of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read January 10th. 1882.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked, \"What is the chemically scientific\r\ndefinition of crystallization?\" Now as the study of crystallization and\r\nits effect upon matter, physically as well as chemically, will be of\r\ninterest, considering the subject matter for discussion, I shall not\r\nonly endeavor to answer the question, as I understand it, but try to\r\ntreat it somewhat technologically.\r\n\r\nHaving this object in view, I have prepared or brought about the\r\nconditions necessary to the formation of a few crystals of various\r\nchemical substances, which for various reasons, such as lack of time and\r\nbad weather, are not as perfect as could be desired, but will perhaps\r\nsubserve the purpose for which they were designed. I think you will\r\nagree with me that they are beautiful, if they are imperfect, and I can\r\nassure you that the pleasure of watching their formation fully repays\r\none for the trouble, if for no other reason than the mere gratification\r\nof the senses. From the earliest times and by all races of men, the\r\ncrystal has been admired and imitated, or improved by cutting and\r\npolishing into faces of various substances. I have also procured\r\nspecimens of steel and iron which show the effect of crystallization,\r\nwhich was produced (perhaps) under known conditions, so that the\r\nconclusions which we arrive at from their study will have a fair chance\r\nof being logical, at least, and perhaps of some practical value.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine inanimate nature we find two grand divisions of matter,\r\n_fluid_ and _solid_. These two divisions may be subdivided into, the\r\nformer gaseous and liquid, the latter amorphous and crystalline; but\r\nwhether one or the other of these divisions be considered, their\r\nultimate and common division will be the ATOM. By the atom we understand\r\nthat portion of matter which admits of no further division, which,\r\nthough as inconceivable for minuteness as space is for extent, has still\r\ndefinite weight, form, and volume; which under favorable circumstances,\r\nhas that power or force called cohesion, the intensity of which\r\nconstitutes strength of material, which every engineer is supposed to\r\nunderstand, but which lies far beyond the powers of the human mind for\r\ncomprehension or analysis. When we apply a magnet to a mass of iron\r\nfilings, we observe the particles arrange themselves in regular order,\r\nhaving considerable strength in one direction, and very little or none\r\nin any other. Now, although we understand very little about the force\r\nwhich holds these particles in position, we do know that it is actual\r\nforce applied from without and maintained at the expense of some of the\r\nknown sources of force. But the force or power or property of cohesion\r\nseems to be a quality stored within the atom itself, in many cases\r\nsimilar to magnetism, having powerful attraction in some directions\r\nand very little or none in others. A crystal of mica, for instance, or\r\ngypsum may be divided to any degree of thinness, but is very difficult\r\nto even break. This property of crystals is termed cleavage. Cohesion\r\nand crystallization are affected variously by various circumstances,\r\nsuch as heat or its absence, motion or its absence, etc. In fact, almost\r\nevery phenomenon of nature within the range of ordinary temperatures\r\nhas effects which may be favorable to the crystallization of some\r\nsubstances, and at the same time unfavorable to others; so it will be\r\nseen that it is impossible to lay down any rule for it except for named\r\nsubstances, like substances requiring like conditions, to bring its\r\natoms into that state of equilibrium where crystallization can occur.\r\nIf we examine crystals carefully we find, not only that nature has here\r\nprovided geometric forms of marvelous beauty and exactness, with faces\r\nof polish and quoins of acuteness equal to the work of the most skillful\r\nlapidist, \"but that in whatever manner or under whatever circumstances a\r\ncrystal may have been formed, whether in the laboratory of the chemist\r\nor the workshop of nature, in the bodies of animals or the tissues of\r\nplants, up in the sky or in the depths of the earth, whether so rapidly\r\nthat we may literally see its growth, or by the slow aggregation of its\r\nmolecules during perhaps thousands of years, we always find that the\r\narrangement of the faces is subject to fixed and definite laws.\" We find\r\nalso that a crystal is always finished and has its form as perfectly\r\ndeveloped when it is the minutest point discernible by the microscope as\r\nwhen it has attained its ultimate growth. I might add parenthetically\r\nthat crystals are sometimes of immense size, one at Milan of quartz\r\nbeing 3 feet 3 inches long and 5 feet 6 inches in circumference, and is\r\nestimated to weigh over 800 pounds; and a gigantic beryl at Grafton, N.\r\nH., is over 4 feet in length and 32 inches in diameter, and weighs not\r\nless than 5,000 pounds; but the most perfect specimens are of small\r\nsize, as some accident is sure to overtake the larger ones before they\r\nacquire their growth, to interfere with their symmetry or transparency.\r\nThis you will see abundantly illustrated by the examples which I have\r\nprepared, as also the constancy of the angles of like faces. Chemically\r\nspeaking, the crystal is always a perfect chemical body, and can never\r\nbe a mechanical mixture. This fact has been of great value to the\r\nscience of chemistry in developing the atomic theory, which has\r\ndemonstrated that a body can only exist chemically combined when a\r\ndefinite number of atoms of each element is present, and that there is\r\nno certainty of such proportions existing except in the crystal. I\r\nhold before you a crystal of common alum. Its chemical symbol would be\r\nAl_{2}O_{3},3SO_{3}+KO,SO_{3}+24H_{2}O. If we knew its weight and wished\r\nto know its ultimate component parts, we could calculate them more\r\nreadily than we could acquire that knowledge by any other means. But the\r\nelements of this quantity of uncrystallized alum could not be computed.\r\nThen we may define crystallization to be the operation of nature wherein\r\nthe chemical atoms or molecules of a substance have sufficient polarized\r\nforce to arrange themselves about a central attracting point in definite\r\ngeometrical forms.\r\n\r\nFresenius defines it thus: \"_Every operation, or process, whereby bodies\r\nare made to pass from the fluid to the solid state, and to assume_\r\ncertain fixed, _mathematically definable, regular forms_.\" It would be\r\nfolly for me to attempt to criticise Fresenius, but I give you both\r\ndefinitions, and you can take your choice. The definition of Fresenius,\r\nhowever, will not suit our present purpose, because the crystallization\r\nof wrought iron occurs, or seems to, _after_ the iron has acquired a\r\n_solid state_.\r\n\r\nIron, as you all know, is known to the arts in three forms: cast or\r\ncrude, steel, and wrought or malleable. Cast iron varies much in\r\nchemical composition, being a mixture of iron and carbon chiefly, as\r\nconstant factors, with which silicium in small quantities (from 1 to\r\n5 per cent.), phosphorus, sulphur, and sometimes manganese (e.g.\r\nspiegeleisen) and various other elements are combined. All of these have\r\nsome effect upon the crystalline structure of the mass, but whatever\r\ncrystallization takes place occurs at the moment of solidification, or\r\nbetween that and a red heat, and varies much, according to the time\r\noccupied in cooling, as to its composition. My own experience leads me\r\nto think that a cast iron having about 3 per cent. of carbon, a small\r\nper centage of phosphorus, say about ½ of 1 per cent., and very small\r\nquantities of silicium, the less the better, and traces of manganese\r\n(the two latter substances _slagging_ out almost entirely during the\r\nprocess of remelting for casting), makes a metal best adapted to the\r\ngeneral use of the founder. Such proportions will make a soft, even\r\ngrained, dark gray iron, whose crystals are small and bright, and whose\r\nfracture will be uneven and sharp to the touch. The phosphorus in this\r\ninstance gives the metal liquidity at a low temperature, but does not\r\nseem to influence the crystallization to any appreciable extent. The two\r\nelements to be avoided by the founder are silicium and sulphur. These\r\ngive to iron a peculiar crystalline appearance easily recognized by\r\nan experienced person. Silicium seems to obliterate the sparkling\r\nbrilliancy of the crystalline faces of good iron, and replace them with\r\nvery fine dull ones only discernible with a lens, and the iron breaks\r\nmore like stoneware than metal, while sulphur in appreciable quantities\r\ngives a striated crystalline texture similar to chilled iron, and very\r\nbrittle. Phosphorus in very large quantities acts similarly. The form of\r\nthe crystal in cast iron is the octahedron, so that right angles with\r\nsharp corners should be avoided as much as possible in castings, as the\r\nmost likely position for a crystal to take would be with its faces along\r\nthe line of the angle. Steel, to be of any value as such, _must_ be made\r\nof the purest material. Phosphorus and sulphur _must_ not exist, except\r\nin the most minute quantities, or the metal is worthless. If either of\r\nthese substances be present in a bar of steel, its structure will\r\nbe coarse, crystalline and weak. The reason of this is unknown, but\r\nprobably their presence reduces the power of cohesion; and, that being\r\nreduced, gives the molecules of steel greater freedom to arrange\r\nthemselves in conformity with their polarity, and this in its turn again\r\nweakens the mass by the tendency of the crystals to cleavage in certain\r\ndirections. Carbon is a constant element in steel, as it is in cast\r\niron, but is frequently replaced by chromium, titanium, etc., or is said\r\nto be, though it is not quite clear to me how it can be so if steel is\r\na chemical compound. However this may be, we know that a piece of good\r\nsoft steel breaks with a fine crystalline fracture, and the same piece\r\nhardened when broken shows either an amorphous structure or one very\r\nfinely crystalline, which would indicate that the crystals had been\r\nbroken up by the action of heat, and that they had not had sufficient\r\ntime to return to their original position on account of the sudden\r\ncooling. The tendency of the molecules of steel after hardening to\r\nassume their natural position when cold seems to be very great, for we\r\nhave often seen large pieces of steel burst asunder after hardening,\r\nthough lying untouched, and sometimes with such force as to hurl the\r\nfragments to some distance. If a piece of steel be subjected to a bright\r\nyellow or white heat its nature is entirely changed, and the workman\r\nsays it is burnt. Though this is not actually a fact, it does well\r\nenough to express that condition of the metal. Steel cannot be burnt\r\nunless some portion of it has been oxidized. The carbon would of course\r\nbe attacked first, its affinity for oxygen being greatest; but we find\r\nnothing wanting in a piece of burnt steel. It can, by careful heating,\r\nhammering and hardening, be returned to its former excellence. Then what\r\nchange has taken place? I should say that two modifications have been\r\nmade, one physical, the other chemical. The change chemically is that\r\nof a chemical compound to a mixture of carbon and iron, so that in a\r\nchemical sense it resembles cast iron. The change physically is that of\r\ncrystallization, being due partly to chemical change and partly to the\r\neffect of heat. I have procured a specimen of steel showing beautifully\r\nthe effect of overheating. The specimen is labeled No. 1, and is a piece\r\nof Park Brothers' steel (one of the best brands made in America). It has\r\nbeen heated at one end to proper heat for hardening, and at the other is\r\nwhat is technically called \"burnt.\" It has been broken at intervals\r\nof about 1½ inches, showing the transition from amorphous or proper\r\nhardening to highly crystalline or \"burnt.\" Malleable or wrought iron\r\nis or should be pure iron. Of course in practice it is seldom such, but\r\ngenerally nearly so, being usually 98, 99, or even more per cent. It is\r\nexceedingly prone to crystallization, the purer varieties being as much\r\nsubject to it as others, except those contaminated with phosphorus,\r\nwhich affects it similarly with steel, and makes it very weak to cross\r\nand tensile strains. I have never estimated the quantity present in any\r\nexcept one specimen, a bar of 1½ round, which literally fell to pieces\r\nwhen dropped across a block of iron. It had 1.32 per cent. of phosphorus\r\nand was very crystalline, though the crystals were not very large. Iron\r\nwhich has been, when first made, quite fibrous, when subjected to a\r\nseries of shocks for a greater or less period, according to their\r\nintensity, when subjected to intense currents of electricity, or when\r\nsubjected to high temperatures, or has by mechanical force been pushed\r\ntogether, or, as it is called, upset, becomes extremely crystalline.\r\nUnder all of these circumstances it is subjected to one physical\r\nphenomenon, that of motion. It would seem that if a bar of iron were\r\nstruck, the blow would shake the whole mass, and consequently the\r\nrelative position of the particles remain unchanged, but this is not the\r\ncase. When the blow is struck it takes an appreciable length of time for\r\nthe effect to be communicated to the other end so as to be heard, if the\r\ndistance is great. This shows that a small force is communicated from\r\nparticle to particle independently along the whole mass, and that each\r\natom actually moves independently of its neighbor. Then, if there be\r\nany attraction at the time tending to arrange it differently, it will\r\nconform to it. So much for theory with regard to this important matter.\r\nIt looks well on paper, but do the facts of the case correspond? If\r\npractically demonstrated and systematically executed, experiments fail\r\nto corroborate the theory, and if, furthermore, we find there is no\r\nnecessity for the theory, we naturally conclude that it is all wrong,\r\nor, at least, imperfectly understood. Now there is one other quality\r\nimparted to iron by successive shocks, which, I think, is independent\r\nof crystallization, and this quality is hardness and consequent\r\nbrittleness. One noticeable feature about this also is, that as\r\n\"absolute cohesion\" or tensile strength diminishes, \"relative cohesion\"\r\nor strength to resist crushing increases. Specimens Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are\r\npieces of Swedish iron, probably from the celebrated mines of Dannemora.\r\nNos. 2 and 3 are parts of the same bolt, which, after some months' use\r\non a \"heading machine\" in a bolt and nut works, where it was subjected\r\nto numerous and violent shocks, (perhaps 50,000 or 60,000 per day),\r\nit broke short off, as you see in No 2, showing a highly crystalline\r\nfracture. To test whether this structure continued through the bolt, I\r\nhad it nicked by a blacksmith's cold chisel and broken. The specimen\r\nshows that it is still stronger at that point than at the point where\r\nit is actually broken, but the resulting fracture shows the same\r\ncrystalline appearance. I next had specimen No. 4 cut from a fresh\r\nbar of iron which had never been used for anything. It also shows a\r\ncrystalline fracture, indicating that this peculiarity had existed in\r\nthe iron of both from the beginning.\r\n\r\nI next took specimen No. 3 and subjected it to a careful annealing,\r\ntaking perhaps two hours in the operation. Although it is a 1-1/8 bolt\r\nand has V threads cut upon it we were unable to break it, although bent\r\ncold through an arc of 90°, and probably would have doubled upon itself\r\nif we had had the means to have forced it. Now what does this show? Have\r\nthe crystals been obliterated by the process of annealing, or has only\r\ntheir cleavage been destroyed, so that when they break, instead of\r\nshowing brilliant, sparkling faces, they are drawn into a fibrous\r\nlooking mass? The latter seems to be the most plausible theory, to which\r\nI admit objections may be raised. For my own part, I am inclined to the\r\nbelief that the crystal exists in all iron which is finished above a\r\nbright red heat, and that between that and black heat they are formed\r\nand have whatever characteristics circumstances may confer upon them,\r\nmodified by the action of agencies heretofore mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
