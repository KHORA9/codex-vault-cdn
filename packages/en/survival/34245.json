He may in\r\nhis earliest beginnings have combined therewith a certain amount of\r\nhunting while he was waiting for his crops to grow, and was forced into\r\nseeking wild fruits and turning up and experimenting on the various\r\nforms of root, learning, too, doubtless with plenty of bitter\r\npunishment, to distinguish between the good and nutritious and the\r\npoisonous and bad.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, a certain amount of fighting would ensue.  Wild\r\nanimals would be encountered, or fellow savages would resent his\r\nintrusion upon lands where the acorns were most plentiful, or some tasty\r\nform of fungus grew.  But whether from natural bent or necessity, as\r\nwell as from his beginnings recorded in the ancient Book, he was a\r\ngardener, and the natural outcome of gardening was, as ideas expanded,\r\nhis becoming a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe world has gone rolling on, and many changes have taken place, but\r\nthese pursuits remain unaltered.  The love of a garden seems to be\r\ninborn; and though probably there are children who have never longed to\r\nhave one of their own, they are rarities, for of whichever sex they be,\r\nthe love of this form of nature still remains.\r\n\r\nThere are those who garden or farm for pleasure, and there are those, of\r\ncourse, who, either on a large or small scale, cultivate the soil for\r\nprofit, while the grades between are innumerable.  But here in England,\r\ntowards the end of such a season as we have had--one that may be surely\r\ntermed a record--one is tempted to say, Where does the pleasure or the\r\nprofit come in?\r\n\r\nCertainly during the present period, or cycle, or whatever it may be\r\ntermed, the English climate is deteriorating.  Joined to that assertion\r\nis the patent fact that the produce of the garden and farm has largely\r\ngone down in price through the cheapness of the foreign imports thrown\r\nupon the market, and the man with small or large capital who looks\r\nforward to making a modest living out of the land, without any dreams of\r\nfortune, may well pause before proceeding to invest his bawbees, and ask\r\nhimself, Where shall I go?\r\n\r\nThousands have debated this question for generations, with the result\r\nthat the Antipodes have been turned into Anglo-Saxon farms; Van Diemen's\r\nLand has become another England, with its meadows, hedgerows, and\r\norchards; New Zealand, the habitat of tree-fern and pine, has been\r\ntransformed.  Even the very surface has changed, and the land that in\r\nthe past hardly boasted a four-footed animal is now rich in its cattle;\r\nwhile Australia, the dry and shadowless, the country of downs, has been\r\nmade alive with flocks, its produce mainly tallow and wool till modern\r\nenterprise and chemistry rendered it possible for the frozen mutton to\r\nreach England untainted after its long voyage across the tropics to our\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nTo keep to the temperate or cold regions, the name of Canada or the\r\ngreat North-West springs up as does the corn which fills our granaries;\r\nwhile the more enterprising cultivators of the soil, who have had souls\r\nabove the ordinary plodding of the farmer's life--the fancy tillers, so\r\nto speak--with the tendency towards gardening, produced our sugar from\r\nthe West Indies and British Guiana, and tobacco and cotton from the\r\nSouthern States, long ere the Stars and Stripes waved overhead; while,\r\nto journey eastward, the gardens have flourished in India and Ceylon\r\nwith indigo, spices, and coffee; and later on, wherever suitable slopes\r\nand terraces were found, the Briton has planted the attractive\r\nglossy-leaved tea shrub, until the trade with China for its fragrant\r\npopular produce has waned.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of lands of promise for the cultivator, unfortunately\r\ntoo often speculative and burdened by doubt.  They are frequently\r\nhandicapped by distance, extremes of climate, and unsuitability to the\r\nBritish constitution.  As in the past, too, imagination often plays its\r\npart, and the would-be emigrant hankers after something new, in spite of\r\nthe cloud of possible failure that may hover on his horizon.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a great attraction in the unknown, and untried\r\nnovelty is always tempting.  But, on the other side, there is the old\r\nand safe, the cultivation of a land which in the past has been\r\nworld-famed for its never-failing produce, its mighty granaries, and its\r\nvast fertility, that can be traced back for thousands of years, whose\r\nsoil, far from becoming exhausted, is ever being renewed, and which at\r\nthe present time is undergoing a transformation that will make its\r\nproduce manifold.\r\n\r\nOf course, the country which contains these qualities is the familiar\r\nold land of Egypt, the dominion of the Khedive, which, in spite of its\r\nwondrous fertility, has had little attraction for the earnest cultivator\r\nof the earth.  It has been the granary of the world for ages; but its\r\ncultivation has been left to its own people, who have gone on with their\r\nold-time barbaric tillage, leaving Nature, in her lavish bounteousness,\r\nto do the rest.\r\n\r\nIn every way wonderful changes are coming over Egypt, where for\r\ncountless ages the policy of the people seemed to be devoted entirely,\r\nas far as the vegetable world was concerned, to the growth of food, or\r\nsuch fibrous plants as proved their suitability for the manufacture of\r\nthe light clothing they required.  Any attempt to permanently beautify\r\nthe country by taking advantage of its fertility, and commencing the\r\nplanting to any great extent of that which was so lacking in the shape\r\nof trees, was left in abeyance till the coming into power of the great\r\nancestor of the present Khedive, Mehemet Ali.  This thinker, of broad\r\nintellect, made some beginnings in this direction, and later on Ismail\r\nPacha gave a great impetus thereto by enlisting the services of a clever\r\nFrench gardener, who, fully awakened at once to the possibilities of\r\nclimate and land, and with ideas running very much in favour of\r\nlandscape gardening, began to introduce and encourage the growth of\r\nshade trees, a complete novelty in a country where the ideas of the\r\npeople seem to tend towards placing their dwellings in the full glare of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nGardens began to spring up, trees were planted in suitable places, and\r\nthe start having been once fairly made, the love of imitation led to the\r\nestablishment of a taste or fashion, and planting has now gone on to\r\nsuch an extent that there are those who are ready to assert that while\r\nthe face of Egypt is becoming changed, the presence of the\r\nrapidly-growing and increasing trees is having its effect, through the\r\nattraction and formation of clouds, upon the meteorology of the country.\r\nIf this continues, as it may, to a vast extent, the fertility of Egypt\r\nwill no longer be confined to the narrow strips on either side of the\r\nNile, but its deserts may become physical features of the past.\r\n\r\nThe idea of those in olden times was to pile up huge erections and to\r\nlet what came spontaneously grow as was its wont.  Now the enlightenment\r\nof the new rulers and the leavening of Western civilisation are working\r\nwonders.  That to which Ismail Pacha gave such a fillip is being\r\nfostered and advanced by the present Khedive, and, the ball being well\r\nset rolling, his people are finding out that nearly everything that\r\nloves moisture and sunshine will grow prodigiously.  It takes time, of\r\ncourse, but many of the beautiful shade trees that have been planted\r\nhave in forty years reached a height of eighty feet, and become rich in\r\ntheir heavy foliage.  The varieties of the eucalyptus, not always the\r\nmost beautiful of trees from their greyish leafage and want of shadow,\r\nare still a wonderful addition to a dry and thirsty land.  Considering\r\ntheir original habitat in Australia, it was a foregone conclusion that\r\nthey would do well here, and they have proved to be most rapid of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThen there is the magnificent Flamboyer des Indes, and scores of other\r\nbeautiful children of Nature, which only required care and fostering in\r\ntheir tender years to prove their liking for their new home.  Endless\r\nare the trees that, once given a start, leave behind their scrubby,\r\nstarved appearance, and become in maturity well able to care for\r\nthemselves and beautify the prospect on every hand.\r\n\r\nAcacias, with their perfumed blossoms; the deep green shady sycamore,\r\nthat good old favourite like the plane of the Levant; the feathery\r\ntamarisk, and scores of ornamental trees, flourish well; while,\r\ncombining the ornamental with the useful, there is the fine,\r\nslow-growing old mulberry, with its rich juicy fruit, and its\r\nsuggestions of the soft straw-coloured or golden yellow rustling silk;\r\nfor if ever there was a country favoured by Nature, in its dryness and\r\nabsence of rain, for the prosperity of the caterpillar of the silkworm\r\nmoth, it should be Egypt, where enterprise and a sensible use of capital\r\nought to leave Asia and Turkey in Europe behind.\r\n\r\nLeaving trees and turning to flowers, gardens in Egypt can be made, and\r\nare made, perfect paradises in the meaning of old Gerard and Parkinson;\r\nfor the country is a very rosery, where the modern decorative sorts\r\nbloom well in company with the more highly scented old-fashioned kinds\r\nlargely cultivated for the distillation of that wonderfully persistent\r\nessential oil, the otto or attar of roses.\r\n\r\nHere the lover of a garden and of exotics can dispense with conservatory\r\nor the protection of glass, and, giving attention to moisture and shade,\r\nmake his garden flush ruddily with the poinsettia, and may also find\r\nendless pleasure in the cultivation of some of the more beautiful\r\nvarieties of the orchid family, which here in England demand the\r\nassistance of a stove.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most attractive time for the visitor from England, who has\r\nthoughts of settling in this country, to see it at its best is when the\r\nNile is rising to its height, bringing down from Equatorial regions its\r\nfull flow of riches and the means of supplying the cultivator with that\r\nwhich will reward him for his labours beneath the torrid sun.\r\n\r\nAt this time the crops are approaching maturity; the vast fields of\r\nmaize have been passing through the various stages of green, waving,\r\nflag-like leaf, and hidden immature cob, with its beautiful, delicate\r\ntassel, prelude of the golden amber or black treasure that is to come\r\nand gladden the eye of the spectator in every direction.  The grassy\r\nmillet, or _dourra_, is equally beautiful in its wavy-wind-swept tracts;\r\nthe cotton crops are gathering strength prior to the swelling and\r\nbursting of the silky boll; and the majestic sugar-cane towers up in its\r\nrapid progress, till the whole country is smiling in preparation for the\r\ngladsome laughter of the harvest that is to come, for it has been a busy\r\ntime.  The fellaheen, in their thousands, have been occupied in that\r\nwonderful irrigation which has been the careful distribution through\r\nmeandering canal, straight-cut dyke, and endless little rill, of the\r\nlurid thick water of the Nile, laden with its rich plant-sustaining\r\nfertility, to the roots of the thirsty plants, and stimulating them\r\nbeneath the ardent sunshine into a growth that is almost startling.  In\r\nother parts the same waters are being ingeniously led to the cultivated\r\nlands that are being made ready for the more ordinary grain crops--the\r\nwheat, the homely barley, and the Egyptian bean, the food of man and\r\nbeast alike; while in a country where grassy down and ordinary meadow,\r\nsuch as form the pasture of sheep, oxen and kine at home, are unknown,\r\ntract upon tract is annually sown with Egyptian clover, lentils, and\r\nsimilar crops--ready for immediate use as cattle food in which the\r\nanimals can graze bit by bit as far as their tethering lines will\r\npermit--for cutting and stacking up green in the form of ensilage, and\r\nconsumption when the crops are past--or for hay.\r\n\r\nThe granary of the world, the vast store-house for nations: people have\r\ngone there to buy, but not to till; and yet it presents so many\r\nqualities that the wonder is that it should have been so long neglected;\r\nwhile now, in its state of transformation through the opening of the\r\ngreat dam and the cutting and forming of miles more irrigating canal,\r\nthere is no bound to what may be done in the future.  The time seems to\r\nbe approaching when Egypt will no longer be spoken of as a narrow strip\r\nof fertile soil running from north to south and bordering the Nile, for\r\nits future seems to be that the barren sand far back from its banks will\r\nbe turned into fertile land, adding its produce of corn and cotton to\r\nthe store-house of the world.\r\n\r\nAs is well-known, vast tracts of Egypt are by nature sterile; but upon\r\nthese barren primaeval sands there has been superimposed for uncountable\r\nages the alluvium of the Nile, so that, as an old writer says, Egypt\r\nitself may be looked upon as the gift of one of the mightiest rivers of\r\nthe world.  He speaks of the Nile as being the father of this country,\r\nbounteous in its gift, a strange, mysterious, solitary stream which\r\nbears down in its bosom the riches of the interior of Africa, carrying\r\nonward from far away south the fertility of the luxuriant tropics, and\r\nturning the sterile sand into the richest soil of the world.  It is this\r\nrichness of the south that has changed the Delta from an arid waste into\r\na scene of matchless beauty.\r\n\r\nOne gazes upon it from the summit of one of the pyramids or some high\r\ncitadel, over cities and ruins of cities, palm grove, green savannah,\r\npalace and garden, luxuriant cornfield, and olive grove.  Far distant,\r\nshimmering in a silvery haze and stretching away into the dimness of the\r\nhorizon, lies the boundless desert, now being rapidly reclaimed,\r\nconsequent upon the great barrage experiments for the supplying of the\r\nmany winding canals with the fertile waters of the parent river.  And of\r\nthese still growing distributors of life, these bearers of commerce, the\r\nnumbers are almost beyond belief.  They are the veins and arteries of\r\nthe country, depositing as they do the rich soil which furnishes\r\nabundance, and then acting as the waterways upon which, in due time, the\r\nharvests are borne throughout the length and breadth of the land.\r\n\r\nThere is a great discrepancy in the reports as to the number of these\r\ncanals, and statements made and chronicled a few years back are not of\r\nmuch use as statistics at the present day; while the completion of the\r\ngreat dam will give such an impulse to their formation that the mileage,\r\neven if properly estimated now, will be useless as a basis ten years\r\nhence.\r\n\r\nOne traveller, in his ignorance of the country, estimated the number of\r\nthese irrigating water distributors as only ninety, while another of\r\nabout the same date gives Upper Egypt alone six thousand.  Probably,\r\nthough, in this instance he included every branch and branchlet that led\r\nthe water amongst the cultivated lands.\r\n\r\nThe water of these canals, renewed as it is by the annual risings of the\r\nNile, goes on steadily changing, wherever it is led, the primaeval sand\r\nof the desert into rich deep soil, after the fashion, but on a grander\r\nscale, of the ingenious way in which portions of fen and bog land in\r\nnorth Lincolnshire and south Yorkshire have been transformed into\r\nfertile farms.  As compared to what is going on in Egypt, this process\r\nis trivial in the extreme; but by man's forethought and ingenuity many a\r\npeat bog and waste that aforetime grew nothing but reed and rush has\r\nbeen made, by draining and leading upon it the muddy waters of the Ouse,\r\nTrent, and their tidal tributaries, into rich and prosperous farms,\r\nproducers of the necessities of life.  These warp farms, as they are\r\ntermed, stand high in favour with the cultivators of the soil.  They\r\nhave taken years to produce, perhaps, and the process has consisted of\r\nbut one treatment.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, on the contrary, this depositing of the rich mud goes on year\r\nby year, adding fresh soil and additional fertility each season; and the\r\npossibilities of increase are almost without limit; while the drainage\r\nproduced by the falling of the Nile, the sandy subsoil, and the\r\nwonderful evaporation of this sunny, almost rainless land, entirely\r\npreclude the newly fertilised tracts becoming sour and stale.\r\n\r\nThose interested should know somewhat of the constituents of this Nile\r\nmud, which is brought down from the south to be deposited, it must be\r\nborne in mind, upon sand which in the course of cultivation will\r\nnaturally, as it is mingled with the mud, render it open, porous, and\r\nhighly suitable for vegetable growth.  A rough analysis proves that\r\nquite half of the deposit is argillaceous, or clayey earth, one fourth\r\ncarbonate of lime.  These constituents alone should be sufficient to\r\ngladden the heart of any farmer or gardener, without counting the iron,\r\ncarbonate of magnesia, and silica.\r\n\r\nSo many of our agricultural outposts are only to be reached by long and\r\ntedious journeys across ocean and then inland.  Egypt is, of course, in\r\nAfrica, but only a few days' journey from our own shores.  The sea\r\ntransit is short and frequent; and the country, the ancient mysterious\r\nland of the Dark Ages, is rapidly being opened out by rail.  The\r\nclimate, in spite of the heat, is one of the finest in the world, and\r\nits healthiness is proverbial; while, best of all for the would-be\r\nadventurer, it is under an enlightened rule, beneath which progress and\r\ncivilisation are flourishing more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nReports from the highest quarters supply abundant statistics of the\r\ngreat advantage already manifested by the completion of the Nile\r\nBarrage.  The increase of land available for culture through the\r\nconservation of the water that has always run to waste, and the\r\naugmented powers supplied for irrigation by holding up such vast bodies\r\nof water, have resulted in returns that are striking in the extreme, and\r\nthis after so short a time has elapsed since the sluices were completed\r\nand the great dams put to the test.  The value of land and rentals have\r\ngone up, water has been utilised at earlier dates than were customary of\r\nold, and everything points not only to stability but to a future for\r\nEgypt such as could not have been dreamed of a score of years ago.  In\r\nconnection, therefore, with its future prospects from an agricultural\r\npoint of view, and the encouragement given by the Government to those\r\nwho are disposed to enter upon a business career in this favoured\r\ncountry, so as to bring to bear experience, the knowledge of culture,\r\nand the use of improved implements to add vastly to Egypt's produce, a\r\nshort sketch of what has been done by one whose faith in the delta as a\r\nvast agricultural centre has always been strong, will not here be out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe allude to the efforts made by his Highness the Khedive in acquiring\r\nand reclaiming tracts of land in the neighbourhood of Cairo and turning\r\nthem into fertile farms.\r\n\r\nA trip to one of these nearest to Cairo struck a visitor directly as\r\nbeing hall-marked by the stamp \"Progress,\" for it was reached by a\r\nlittle model railway which skirts his Highness's estates.  After leaving\r\nthe station, a short drive brings the visitor almost at once to a series\r\nof scenes indicating careful management and model farming, though there\r\nis much in it that is novel to an English eye, consequent on its being\r\ncontrived to suit the exigencies of an Eastern country where but little\r\nrain is known to fall.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects reached upon entering the cultivated land was\r\nthe great granary or store, composed of spacious erections of but one\r\nstorey high, low-roofed, and enclosing a large central square.  In some\r\nof these buildings were stored up sacks of corn, while in others lay\r\nlarge heaps of the newly picked cotton, of whose cultivation more will\r\nbe said elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe land around this highly cultivated domain is very fertile, and the\r\nair exhilarating; and at present it is letting at the rate of 10 pounds\r\nper feddan, which represents the Egyptian acre, something larger than\r\nour own.  This is the present price, for enterprise so far has done\r\nlittle upon this side of Cairo in the shape of market gardening,\r\nalthough the district is only twelve minutes by rail from the centre of\r\nthis important city, and one hour's distance for a walking horse and\r\ncart.\r\n\r\nAttached to the building above referred to were well-erected ranges of\r\ncattle-sheds, not occupied for fattening purposes, but for the culture\r\nof the farm, this culture being carried on not by horses, but by oxen--\r\nbuffaloes and ordinary bullocks--which are regularly used, as at one\r\ntime in Old England, yoked to the plough, harrow, or roller, and on some\r\nof the high grounds which are let by his Highness, for turning the\r\nwater-wheels, though on the model farms steam power only is used for the\r\npurposes of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThese sheds are built in the same fashion as the granary, a noteworthy\r\npoint in connection with the big, sleek, well-fed occupants being that\r\ninstead of, as in English fashion, standing in one long row with their\r\nbacks to the visitor, they are ranged in ranks, fifty-six in all,\r\nsideways to the spectator, facing so many feeding troughs, and each\r\nprovided with its tethering halter and a sliding iron ring attached to\r\nan iron bar, giving freedom to each animal to stand or lie down at its\r\npleasure without any risk of self-inflicted injury.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the model-farm-like erection of these buildings, it may\r\nbe stated that the feeding troughs are of solid masonry, made impervious\r\nand clean by an inner lining of zinc.  No partitions are used to\r\nseparate these draught cattle, but by the arrangement of the haltering\r\nthey can be kept at such a distance that no two could come into contact.\r\nEverything was beautifully clean, the great animals being amply\r\nsupplied with dry earth for litter, its disinfecting qualities being\r\nadmirable from a cleanly point of view, and valuable for the purposes of\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal foods for cattle upon the farm is _Tibn_, as it is\r\ncalled by the Egyptians--chopped or bruised straw, made more nutritious,\r\naccording to the needs of the animal in feeding, by the addition of\r\nbeans or barley; and in the progress across the place a huge stack of\r\nthis chaff-like provender was passed, some ten feet high, but totally\r\nunprotected from the weather by thatch.  The reply to questions by the\r\nmanager was simple in the extreme, yet in itself a chapter on the\r\nbeautiful nature of the climate.  The reason why the stack had no\r\nprotecting thatch was that there was no need, the rain was so trifling,\r\nand when the wind and its habit of scattering stacks was mentioned, the\r\ninquirer was told that it did no harm.\r\n\r\nIn passing one enclosure sheep were encountered--a class of farming, as\r\nstated elsewhere, little affected on account of the absence of grass\r\ndowns and ordinary grazing fields; but these were in a\r\nealthy, flourishing state, well fleeced, with a fine white\r\n\r\nsemi-transparent-looking wool, indicating relationship to the Angora\r\nbreed, specimens of the latter being seen later on in fold.\r\n\r\nSome of the fields had been devoted to the growth of cotton.  This had\r\nlately been picked and transferred to the great store, the wood of the\r\nbeautiful plant so stored being yet upon the ground waiting for transfer\r\nto the stacks for fuel purposes, it being utilised for the steam engines\r\nused upon the farm, especially for working the water-raising machinery\r\nso extensively needed in this occasionally thirsty land.\r\n\r\nFarther on an implement was being used in preparing fields for\r\nirrigation; and as in its simplicity of construction it was dragged over\r\nthe great enclosure, it drew up the well-tilled, friable soil into\r\nridges or slightly raised portions whose object was to regulate the flow\r\nof irrigating water equally all over the field, so that when it was\r\nflooded no portion should get more than its due share, one part being\r\nswamped while another would be comparatively dry.  Simple in the extreme\r\nin its construction, as the illustration shows, the implement was\r\nthoroughly efficient in the way in which it did its work, with but\r\nslight exertion on the part of the sluggish oxen by which it was drawn.\r\n\r\nAll this was novel, yet paradoxically old-world and strange, but in the\r\nnext field there was a combination of the old and new--a pair of oxen\r\nused as in Saxon times, and down to not so many years back even near\r\nLondon, patiently plodding along beneath their yoke and drawing an\r\nemanation from our Eastern counties in the shape of a Ransome and Sims'\r\nharrow, light and effective, apparently as much at home and progressing\r\nas easily as if on a Suffolk farm.\r\n\r\nThere was a familiarity about these fields which took off the dead\r\nmonotony of the level, for they were surrounded by good-sized,\r\nwell-grown trees, whose aspect betokened health and a suitability of\r\nclimate, while on a nearer approach they showed their foreignness to the\r\nsoil, proving to be a variety of the well-known Siberian crab, or cherry\r\napple, beloved of boys, but here grown in such bulk as to suggest being\r\nused for crushing and utilising in some special way.\r\n\r\nOne thing that strikes the European in Egypt, when passing beyond the\r\nmore carefully cultivated portions near the city, is the absence of\r\ntrees other than the indigenous palms; but here, in these\r\nnewly-reclaimed portions, much has been done, as already mentioned, in\r\nthe way of planting.  For instance, the approaches to a range of\r\nbuildings in connection with this farm were studded with acacias,\r\nornamenting what proved to be the pigeon houses which are such a regular\r\nadjunct to an Egyptian cultivator's home.  Their occupants bear a strong\r\nresemblance to our own blue rocks, or wood pigeons.  Another building\r\nwas the dairy farmhouse, well-built, simple, and most suitable; while in\r\nthe neighbouring fields the cows were pasturing after the economical\r\nplan carried out in our Channel Islands--where each milk-producer is not\r\nallowed to wander through and waste the precious herbage at her own\r\nsweet will, but is tethered to a stake--while the calves had an\r\nenclosure to themselves.  Here were many examples of experiments being\r\ntried to improve the breed, the favourite animal being a cross between\r\nthe Swiss--Fribourg--and native; and in this cross-breeding only those\r\nproved to be advantageous are retained.  Such as do not show some marked\r\nadvance upon the native stock, either for breeding or the production of\r\nmilk, are sold.\r\n\r\nOne very fine sire was close at hand--a Swiss bull with a noble head and\r\nshort curved horns, fine and long of coat, which about brow and neck\r\nformed itself into short, crisp curls like those that cluster upon the\r\nbrow of the classic Hercules.  This grand animal greatly resembled, save\r\nthat it was much larger, one of the choice and jealously guarded\r\npatriarchs of a Jersey cattle-shed; while his home-like aspect was added\r\nto greatly by the familiar ring in the nose, which is not considered\r\nnecessary for the native animals.\r\n\r\nA little farther on were those rather uncouth-looking, heavily-horned\r\nanimals, the buffaloes, which run side by side in Egyptian estimation\r\nwith the ordinary cattle for all practical purposes.  The improvement in\r\ntheir breed is also studied by the addition of fresh blood and the\r\nchoice of sires remarkable for special qualities.  One particularly good\r\nspecimen was pointed out, distinguished by the heavy hump forward, a\r\nfine beast lately brought from the Soudan.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct breeds of buffalo utilised in this country--the\r\nproductions of Upper and Lower Egypt, those from the latter district\r\nbeing reckoned the better.\r\n\r\nIn this portion of the farm and around the buildings fruit trees were\r\nplentiful, diversifying the scene and adding greatly to its\r\nattractiveness, and looking novel to a visitor from Europe, who saw an\r\nabundant growth of the Seville or bitter orange, and the cool,\r\ngreeny-grey picturesque olive of Southern Europe and the East.\r\n\r\nAmong other fruit trees seen here were some bearing long pods, called\r\n_chiar shambar_ by the natives.  The fruit of these trees, which is long\r\nand green, but which turns black soon after picking, seemed at a\r\ndistance like a huge bean, suggesting that the fruit was akin to the\r\ncarob or locust bean, this idea being emphasised by the sweet glutinous\r\npulp in which the seeds were buried.  This pulp is pleasant to the\r\ntaste, but slightly bitter, and is largely used by the natives boiled up\r\nwith water, as a drink on account of its medicinal qualities.\r\n\r\nTaken all in all, the visit to the Khedive's farm was most attractive,\r\nand pregnant with proofs of the fertility of the well-tended land, for\r\non every side were examples of the successful culture of many of the\r\nagricultural products treated of in detail from the notes of the\r\nstudent-like superintendent, who has all in his charge.\r\n\r\nThe place, as before said, may be regarded as a model and example of\r\nwhat can be done with land that has been looked upon for ages as so much\r\ndesert, when all that was required was industry, application, and the\r\ningenuity necessary for extending the action of the Nile flood.  Nature\r\nhas always been ready to do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Khedive has another tract of farm land, which he purchased some time\r\nback, about two kilometres from the estate just described, at Koubbeh.\r\nThis is Mostorod, where he has a simple-looking villa.  On the way here\r\none of the first things that attract the attention of an Englishman is\r\nthat home-like contrivance so often missing in foreign countries--a\r\nhedge dividing the fields from the roadway and separating them from each\r\nother.  These were unknown before the time of Abbas Helmi the Second,\r\nand what may be done in time to come in the surroundings of farms by\r\nmeans of the simple, well cut back hawthorn remains to be proved.  Here\r\nthe shrubby growth, chosen for its neat form and comparatively rapid\r\ndevelopment, is the bitter orange.\r\n\r\nAt Mostorod many of the surroundings are marked by the energetic\r\nproceedings of the practical farmer.  Here steam is at work, like the\r\npatient slave it is, forming the motive power in one case for raising\r\nwater for all farming purposes, in another setting in action the mills,\r\nwhich rapidly turn out and clean the meal ground from wheat and Indian\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nBuildings are here containing the various grains and seeds; others are\r\nthe storehouses for one or other of the three pickings produced in the\r\ncultivation of cotton; and at the entrance of every building, just\r\ninside the door, there is a pitch pine wood frame, with its glass\r\ncovering, and a paper on which is a record of the amount and nature of\r\nwhatever is brought in or taken out of the building in the shape of\r\ncorn, cotton, seed, or whatever may be stored.\r\n\r\nHere, in opposition to much that is modern, there is a large,\r\nold-fashioned Egyptian stable, very thick of wall.  The building is\r\ndivided into two chambers, connected and lit from overhead, the light\r\ncoming through the roof of wood and rafters thickly thatched with reeds.\r\n\r\nThese rafters are supported by thick round columns formed of the\r\nancient, sun-dried brick for which Egypt has long been famed.  Near by\r\nsomething of the old-world fashion of the place was visible in a typical\r\ngrinding mill such as may be seen in common use in pretty well every\r\nvillage.  It had a chamber to itself, and differed little from those\r\nwhich might have been seen in England fifty or a hundred years ago, set\r\nin action by an often blindfolded horse, but here worked by a bullock.\r\n\r\nOrnamentation is not wanting at Mostorod, for the villa has its garden\r\nbrightened by fruit trees, and the pillar-stemmed palms, with their\r\nleafy crowns, are frequent objects in the transparent, sunny air.\r\n\r\nClose at hand is the village on the Khedivial estate.  In it the streets\r\nare narrow and the houses of one height, thoroughly waterproof, and of\r\nthe familiar construction, of sun-dried bricks covered with white\r\nplaster, and, being of an earlier date in the improvement the Khedive is\r\nstriving for in the poorer class dwellings, not to be compared with the\r\nspick and span new houses he has lately had erected at Mariout, not far\r\nfrom Alexandria.\r\n\r\nHard by this village is a very large barn or stack yard with more native\r\npigeon houses, the whole of the surroundings being extremely quaint and\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nAgain, a short distance onward stands the native village of Mostorod,\r\nwith its attractive little mosque and a tomb erected to the memory of a\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nThe Ismailia Canal supplies water to the Koubbeh and Mostorod estates,\r\nand in this neighbourhood is a good deal of very valuable agricultural\r\nland, some portions of which are let to the fellaheen for three months\r\nin a year, so as to enable them to grow a crop of maize.\r\n\r\nHereabouts, tethered in the clover fields, a herd of the Khedive's\r\ncamels are pastured, many of these being bred for carrying purposes,\r\nothers (the slighter of build) for riding and speed.  The scene is\r\nattractive from its verdure, but comparatively treeless, though it is\r\nworthy of mention that two solitary weeping willows do their best to\r\nadorn the landscape--a plain with the suggestions of home in the shape\r\nof lapwings, or birds bearing a very strong resemblance, which fly up\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\nThis estate is close to Heliopolis--the ancient On--where almost the\r\nonly suggestions of the City of the Sun are the sunshine and a great\r\nsquare piece of white stone, bearing hieroglyphs, and in perfect\r\npreservation, while in the distance stands up in solitary state the\r\nfar-famed Obelisk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n\"Words, words, words!\" quoth Hamlet, and the reader of this sketch of\r\nthe possibilities in the way of cultivation offered by the Khedive's\r\ndominions may be disposed to contemptuously say the same.  But in the\r\nfollowing pages it is proposed to give proof of what may be done in an\r\nordinary way by one who is gardener for pleasure and health, supplier of\r\nordinary produce to the market, or farmer upon a larger scale, without\r\nlooking for a moment upon the vast increase that is bound to follow the\r\nwider and wider distribution of that life of such a land--abundant\r\nwater, not merely for irrigation, but in this case charged year by year\r\nwith the rich fertilising mud of the vast equatorial regions regularly\r\nborne down by the Nile in flood.\r\n\r\nAmong the first questions an intending settler might ask respecting the\r\ncountry that he intends to make his temporary or future home would\r\nnaturally be, \"What is the place like?  What sort of seasons are they?\"\r\n\r\nEgypt is a country which may be said to be blessed with four seasons.\r\nThere is that which begins in July with the inundation of the Nile, when\r\nfor about two months the whole country of the Delta may be likened to a\r\nvast lake dotted with islands represented by the towns and villages.\r\nNaturally, then, the air is moist, and mornings and evenings have their\r\nmists.  In the second season, answering to our winter and early spring,\r\nwe have cold nights; but the days are hot, and the vegetation is rapid\r\nand luxuriant.  The third, corresponding to our spring, is the least\r\nattractive; while the fourth, which continues until the rising of the\r\nNile, is in the highest degree delightful.\r\n\r\nEveryone has praised the Egyptian nights--cloudless skies, an intensely\r\nbright moon, so bright that at harvest time, for reasons in connection\r\nwith the shedding of the grain, it is the custom amongst the farmers and\r\ncultivators of the soil to take advantage of the coolness and light to\r\ncommence garnering their crops at midnight.  So bright is the moon in\r\nthis extraordinarily clear atmosphere that the peasantry who sleep in\r\nthe open air are careful to shade their eyes from the rays, which are\r\noften said to produce a more painful effect than those of the sun.\r\n\r\nThese pages contain the experience of long years of patient study of the\r\ncultivation of Egypt, of that carried on by the native, who for ages\r\npast has looked to the soil for his sustenance.  And of his practical\r\nknowledge, that which is valuable has been adopted; while experiment,\r\nexperience, and the effects of modern cultivation have run with it side\r\nby side.\r\n\r\nEvery gardener and farmer knows, however enlightened he may be and fond\r\nof the modern ways of doing things, that it is not wise to look\r\nslightingly upon old-fashioned customs.  _Experientia docet_ is a\r\nwell-known maxim, and the experience taught often by generations of\r\ndisappointments is worthy of all respect.\r\n\r\nMen go on cultivating and growing certain things which excite the\r\ncontempt of a stranger, but too often he lives to learn that there was\r\ngood reason for the practice, hence, animated by the spirit of respect\r\nfor the old, while striving to introduce the new and improved, the notes\r\nand descriptions herein contained may be depended upon as being\r\nthoroughly practical and well worthy the attention of every cultivator\r\nwho has at heart the future of the Delta and the higher irrigated lands\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\nFurther, it may be presumed that every reader is fully acquainted with\r\nthe fact that lower Egypt possesses a climate without extreme variations\r\nof temperature; that winter is hardly known but as a name; and that,\r\nthough changes have taken place of late years, probably from increased\r\ncultivation and planting, the rainfall is extremely small.  And yet the\r\nfertility of Egypt is proverbial, and due to this annual flooding of the\r\nlands by the Nile, which--after the fashion, already referred to, of the\r\nnorthern midlands of England, where so many acres have been flooded and\r\ndrained after a lengthened deposit of mud, or \"warp,\" as it is termed--\r\nbecome rich in the extreme.  The warping in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire\r\nis an artificial and protracted process, carried out once only; the\r\nwarping of the land of Egypt is natural, and repeated year by year;\r\nwhile as soon as the water has run off, the coating of mud, rich in all\r\nthe qualities of fertility, is ready to bear, after the merest\r\nscratching of the soil, its abundant one, two, or even three crops in a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHere are possibilities, then, for the cultivator who is ready to bring\r\nto bear all the appliances of modern science, the discoveries of\r\npractical agricultural chemistry, and, above all, the mechanical and\r\ningenious inventions so admirable in a flat, open country, unbroken by\r\nhedge or tree.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor objects familiar to the tourist in his journey up the\r\nNile are the various means of raising water for the irrigation of the\r\ncrops.  These have been, and still continue to be in many places\r\nextremely primitive, for, as before stated, the fellaheen in their\r\nconservative fashion are prone to cling to the inventions of their\r\nforefathers.  Hence they may still be seen laboriously at work with\r\ntheir shadoofs, sakiehs, and other water-wheels worked by hand or mule\r\npower, raising the fertilising fluid to a sufficient height to be\r\ndischarged and flow of itself, spreading over the patches of land\r\nrequiring irrigation.\r\n\r\nBut these clumsy contrivances are giving place in the newly-reclaimed\r\nand cultivated parts of the Delta to modern machinery, urged by motive\r\npower, notably by steam, though to a great extent advantage is taken of\r\nthe wind; for it is a common thing to see in the landscape the circular\r\ndisc-like object, as noted at a distance, formed by a windmill with its\r\nmany fans, or \"vans,\" standing at the edge of some canal or by one of\r\nthe many wells that have been dug upon the higher grounds.\r\n\r\nFor though tract after tract may be desert, presenting nothing but\r\ncoarse growth and sand ready to drift before the wind, there is not much\r\ndifficulty in finding water, notably in the wide plateau known as\r\nMariout, spreading out in the direction of the Libyan Desert from\r\nAlexandria.  Here the sinking of wells results in the finding of water\r\nat depths varying from twenty to forty feet, and boring to a greater\r\ndepth would doubtless produce a fuller supply, for in so flat and porous\r\na land, within easy measurable distance of the great inland sea, there\r\nis every probability that an inexhaustible supply is within touch.  And\r\nnowadays the various ingenious contrivances of the mechanical engineer\r\nare always ready, and at small cost, to supplement during the dry times\r\nthe abundant supply offered by the great river.  Of course, this deals\r\nsolely with the higher grounds that are not reached without mechanical\r\nhelp by the dam-supplied network of canals that already veins the\r\ncountry, and projects for the increase of which are, since the opening\r\nof the great works at Assiout and Assouan, either under consideration,\r\nor already planned.\r\n\r\nThe slow, clumsy hand labour of the shadoof and the awkward\r\ncattle-worked sakieh, or earthen pot surrounded water-wheel, is now\r\nbeing superseded in the larger tracts of cultivation by such ingenious\r\npieces of mechanism as the centrifugal pump, worked by steam, and so\r\ncontrived that it can be utilised on the bank of river or canal, and\r\nwith a suction tube turned down at any angle, so that it can be lowered\r\ninto any of the common wells that are sunk in all directions.  The\r\nportable steam engine used in connection therewith is one of the\r\ngrandest slaves of civilisation, playing its part on the large farms for\r\ntraction, threshing, straw chopping, or other of the many necessities of\r\ncultivation.  By means of these centrifugal pumps after the middle of\r\nNovember on large estates the water has to be forced into the service\r\n(estate) canals.\r\n\r\nA ten-horse power engine, driving a ten-inch pump, will irrigate the\r\nsame number of acres in twelve hours, lifting the water five feet, the\r\ncost of raising water being two shillings per acre.  The small occupiers\r\nof land sometimes raise their supply from wells and canals by means of\r\nPersian wheels or Archimedean screws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo when the Nile commences its annual rise, for the first few days\r\nits tint seems to be green; but the general tone during the inundation\r\nis of a dirty red, of course due to its being thickened with the mud\r\nbrought down from the south.  During this rising, irrigation can be sent\r\nfreely flowing over all cultivated lands, as the river continues about\r\nthe level of the banks till the middle of November.\r\n\r\nIn simple language, irrigation means the turning of desert into richly\r\nfertile producing land.  A great deal has been said and done, but\r\neverything points to the fact that, however great and productive a\r\ngarden Egypt has been for countless years, it is still almost, as it\r\nwere, in its infancy.  The erection of that stupendous piece of\r\nengineering, the Assouan Dam, has already had effects that have\r\nsurpassed the expectations of its projectors; and writing upon this\r\nsubject, Sir William Willcocks, a gentleman whose knowledge of the\r\nposition is of the highest value, points out a series of facts that are\r\nalmost startling in their suggestions.  He draws attention to the fact\r\nthat there are still two million acres of excellent land waiting to be\r\nreclaimed after the simple fashion herein described, and then requiring\r\nto be irrigated to the full extent needed--that is to say, perennially.\r\n\r\nThese are large figures to deal with, but Egypt is a vast country, and\r\nits powers of production almost beyond belief; but everything is bound\r\nup in the one need--water supply; and it is this furnishing of life to\r\nplants, and enabling them to find it latent, as it were, in the\r\nfar-spreading plains that are as yet but sand and dust, that is taking\r\nthe attention of our great engineers.\r\n\r\nHere they find room to exert their powers.  It is only a year ago that\r\nwe had the inauguration of the first great stride; and now we are told\r\nthat the thirsty country asks for more.  To fully carry out the\r\nperennial irrigation that shall fertilise the two million acres still\r\nwaiting, \"the country requires one milliard of cubic metres of water per\r\nfive hundred thousand acres\"--that is to say, four times that quantity.\r\nAt the present time, with the height to which it has been already\r\nerected, the Assouan Dam holds up and supplies one milliard of these\r\ncubic metres of water in all, a sufficiency for five hundred thousand\r\nacres of agricultural and garden land.  It is proposed to raise it\r\ntwenty-one feet higher, with the result that its holding powers will be\r\nso vastly increased that the supply will be doubled, and hence be\r\nsufficient for another five hundred thousand acres.  But even then there\r\nwill be a milliard acres still waiting for a supply of water to the\r\nextent of two milliards of cubic metres of water for themselves.  Whence\r\nis this supply to come?\r\n\r\nThe engineers are ready with their answer, and only ask for the capital,\r\nnot to float some mad scheme, but to spread bounteously the rich water\r\nwhich turns, as above said, the desert into fertile land.\r\n\r\nThe plan, or project, is to form a huge reservoir in the Wady Rayan,\r\nwhich will with ease supply the water needed at a cost of about two\r\nmillion pounds--a large sum of money, but ridiculously small in\r\ncomparison with the results.  There is, however, a drawback in\r\nconnection with this reservoir--a weakness, so to speak, which alone\r\nwould render its value questionable, for while in April and May, during\r\nthe flood time, its supply would be enormous, it would fall off very\r\nmuch in June, and furnish but very little in July.\r\n\r\nBut now in connection therewith we find the truth of the old proverbial\r\nsaying, \"Co-operation is strength.\"  Alone it would be weak, but if made\r\nnow and worked in connection with the Assouan Reservoir it becomes\r\nstrong, and the two being tapped in turn as the need arose, the\r\ncombination would have tremendous results, one reservoir so helping the\r\nother that sufficient water could be depended upon to keep up a\r\nperennial supply.\r\n\r\nTo give Sir William Willcocks' words:\r\n\r\n  Let us now imagine that both reservoirs are full of water, and it is\r\n  April 1st.  The Wady Rayan Reservoir will be opened on to the Nile and\r\n  give all the water needed in that month, while the Assouan Reservoir\r\n  will be maintained at its full level.  In May the Wady Rayan Reservoir\r\n  will give nearly the whole supply, and the Assouan Reservoir will give\r\n  a little.  In June the Wady Rayan Reservoir will give a small part of\r\n  the supply, and the Assouan Reservoir will give the greater part.  In\r\n  July the Wady Rayan Reservoir will give nothing, and the Assouan\r\n  Reservoir will give the whole supply required.  Working together in\r\n  this harmonious and beautiful manner, these reservoirs, which are the\r\n  true complements of each other will easily provide the whole of the\r\n  water needed for Egypt.\r\n\r\nNow, this raising of the Assouan Dam to the height proposed means an\r\nexpenditure of five hundred thousand pounds, and the time for the\r\ncompletion of this addition and raising of the works two years, at the\r\nend of which period, as we have seen, its power for irrigation will be\r\ndoubled; while to make the additional reservoir, and enable it to\r\ndischarge its vast extra supply at the cost named, will take three\r\nyears; four years will then be required to bring the water to its proper\r\nheight--seven years in all; so that in that time full arrangements can\r\nbe made for the perennial irrigation of the whole of Egypt.\r\n\r\nHuge sums of money these to spend or put into the soil, two millions and\r\na half sterling; but let us see what there is to be said on the credit\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTake one point alone.  The increase in the cotton crop of Egypt would be\r\nmost extensive, and its value enormous.  Then there is the land itself.\r\nHere we have so many extra acres, only partially irrigated, but which by\r\nthis raising of the supply of water will be changed from partial supply\r\nland into constant--that is, each acre will be enabled to tap the\r\nreservoirs at all times of the year, according to the cultivator's need,\r\nwith the consequent rise in value of the land of thirty pounds per\r\nfeddan, or acre; and that means, according to Sir William Willcocks, an\r\nincrease in the wealth of Egypt to the extent of sixty million pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom one bold stroke!  Sixty million pounds for the expenditure of five.\r\nNot bad, this, for the engineers.  But still, it is but the beginning\r\nof what may be done in the Khedive's country, for it is full of\r\nsuggestions to be carried out by an enterprising people for the making\r\nof the native and those of our own country who are prepared to look far\r\nahead.  The amount of land to be reclaimed is enormous; and what land!\r\nFor countless ages the Nile has flowed down, bringing with it its\r\nfertile mud, depositing some by the way, carrying other some out to sea,\r\nto be lost in the depths of the Mediterranean; but still, as time rolled\r\non, adding to, and raising higher, the huge Delta through which the\r\nvarious mouths made their way; so that in these lowest portions of Egypt\r\nthe depth of rich soil must be enormous.\r\n\r\nHere lie the lakes and canals of olden formation, shallowed and choked\r\nwith mud, and rendered almost impassable for transit, but only waiting\r\nfor the engineers to contrive modern works, the result of survey and\r\nlevel, feeding canals and the forming of reservoirs to supply irrigation\r\nwater for freeing the land of its salt, making easy the navigation of\r\nthe district, and simplifying the conveyance of its grain and other\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nAll this development is awaiting enterprise and capital low down in the\r\nDelta.  But the engineers have not stopped near home and the Khedive's\r\ncapital; they have cast their eyes afar across that vast extent of\r\nbarbarism, the re-conquered Soudan, where, bordering upon the Nile, it\r\nis often \"water, water everywhere, and not a drop\" for the crops to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nSir William Garstin has been busy here, surveying and examining what can\r\nbe done towards and beyond Khartoum.  Here rich tracts of fertile land\r\nare lying on both sides of the Blue Nile, to the extent, roughly\r\nspeaking, of some three millions of acres.  This land of Upper Egypt is\r\nas rich in its capabilities as that of the Delta; but it has qualities\r\nwhich the latter does not possess, and is more suitable for the\r\nproduction of excellent cotton, which can be sown as a flood crop and\r\nreaped in winter, an advantage which the seasons will not permit in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nHere, again, then, is an opening for enterprise and capital in the\r\nfuture, for it must not be forgotten that the Suakin-Berber Railway,\r\nwell in progress, opens up this part of the country, one which some of\r\nthese days will be brought well in touch with Liverpool and the northern\r\nmanufacturing towns, as the cotton-growing capabilities of Upper Egypt\r\nextend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nIn a country which depends upon floods and their deposit for its\r\nfertility, one of the first questions likely to be asked by a practical\r\nman is, What about the drains?  He knows perfectly well, from reading\r\nand report, that the evaporation of the waters that have for the time\r\nbeing turned vast tracts of land literally into swamps must be enormous,\r\nbut at the same time some plan for carrying off the superabundant\r\nmoisture must be in force.  Let him learn at once that in Egyptian\r\nagriculture there are no underground tiled drains in use; but open ones\r\nare formed upon land that requires improving, such as the rice fields\r\nand those which, when cultivation has commenced, are found to be\r\nimpregnated with salts, while a great deal is done by the Government,\r\nunder whose direction large main cuts are dug to drain off the water on\r\nlow-lying lands.\r\n\r\nOn the rich soils water may be lying to a depth of four inches after a\r\nflood, but it is so readily absorbed that in six hours none will be left\r\non the Surface; but infiltration from irrigation canals sometimes\r\ndamages the crops alongside, and in such a case as that a small catch\r\ndrain will prevent further mischief.\r\n\r\nWith regard to irrigation, two systems are carried out, the one peculiar\r\nto Lower Egypt, the other being utilised in Upper.  In Lower Egypt the\r\ncanal is used for the supply of water to the crops.  In Upper Egypt the\r\nmanner adopted is technically termed the \"basin system.\"\r\n\r\nIn this latter method embankments are formed to enclose tracts of land\r\nwell within reach of the Nile flood, which may contain from two thousand\r\nto forty thousand acres, according to the means of, or facilities\r\noffered to, the agriculturist.  Afterwards the proceedings are\r\nexceedingly simple.  When the inundation is at its greatest height,\r\nopenings are made and the water is allowed to flow from the river till\r\nthe sandy surface is covered to a depth of six feet.  Then the matter,\r\nsuspended in the muddy waters, is slowly deposited and goes on sinking\r\ntill November, when openings are made into canals, and the water is\r\nallowed to slowly drain off and make its way back into the river, when\r\nthe surface of glistening mud that is left is considered ripe for\r\ncultivation, and according to the season may measure perhaps four inches\r\nin depth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the water is gone, the farming operations begin, and in the\r\nsimplest and probably the oldest form.  There is nothing more to be done\r\nin these cases, no ploughing or harrowing; but wheat, barley, beans,\r\nclover, linseed, and lentils are sown broadcast by the patient\r\nlabourers, the sowers often sinking knee deep in the mud as they slowly\r\nplod or almost wade to and fro.  The next proceeding is the burying of\r\nthe seed, which is generally effected by drawing a large beam of timber\r\nover the muddy surface, though at times, when the consistency is\r\ngreater, the seed is covered in by hand-hoeing.  That is all, and the\r\nagriculturist leaves the rest for the time being to the efforts of the\r\nsun.  Germination soon begins, and rapid growth succeeds in the moist\r\nmud; while these crops do not need or receive any further irrigation\r\nexcept from rain, which may fall two or three times in the course of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nBut there are times when no rain at all will come to help the crops,\r\nwhich, however, seem to suffer very little, from the simple fact that\r\nthe thorough saturation of the subsoil by the flood, and the constant\r\ngentle evaporation going on, make up to a certain extent for the want of\r\ngenial showers, and the failure seems to be confined to the straw alone,\r\nwhich is shorter than if its growth had been influenced by the dropping\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nThe floods of European lands are, of course, only occasional, accidents\r\ndue to a prevalence of storm waters, which the regular rivers and the\r\nartificial drainage of the country have not power to carry off; while\r\ngenerally they last but a short time, and instead of being beneficial\r\nare destructive.  The Nile flow is in every respect the reverse.\r\nInstead of being occasional and of short duration, it is a part of\r\nNature's routine, and perfectly wondrous in its regularity; while in\r\nplace of being temporary, as in the floods of our own islands, we have\r\nhere a lasting overflow.\r\n\r\nAgain, a flood in the British Islands, where the rivers burst their\r\nbanks and spread over meadow-land and arable fields, leaves the soil\r\nsoured, sodden, and obnoxious to the plants which are still alive, whole\r\ncrops and plantations being often swept away, while those that remain\r\nare on the high road to perishing from rottenness.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the subsoil of sand is ready to absorb, and the ardent sun to\r\nrapidly dry, the surface of the mud as soon as the flood sinks, after\r\nits stay of months; while the rapidity of growth soon makes up for the,\r\nso to speak, dormant state of the cultivated ground that has been\r\nflooded, and, as aforesaid, the water departs, leaving its fertilising\r\nriches behind.  Then, as stated, follows without further tilling the\r\nsowing of the crops, which result in abundant growth.  This annual\r\nregularity is only marred by the extent of the inundation, which is\r\ncalculated and divided by the Egyptians into high flood, mean flood, and\r\npoor flood, according to how far the waters extend when they leave their\r\nnatural bed.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated that in the first case, when the Nile has reached its\r\nhighest point, it has risen to thirty-three feet; in the second case,\r\nthe mean flood, thirty feet; and in the third, or poor flood,\r\ntwenty-three feet above its bed.  As a matter of course, the higher the\r\nflood the wider spread is the inundation, and the deeper the deposit of\r\nfertile mud left upon the land when the river has returned to its\r\nordinary limits.\r\n\r\nStay-at-home people are accustomed to look upon Holland as the land of\r\ncanals, and the face of this carefully cultivated country is monumental\r\nas a specimen of a nation's industry in cutting waterways for the double\r\npurpose of draining and traffic, while its drains are as admirable as\r\nthey are great.  Wide tracts of land have been turned from sandy wastes\r\nand swamps into fertile meadows and carefully cultivated fields by the\r\nDutch engineers, who have also left traces of their handiwork upon the\r\neast coast of England in the drainage of the fens.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving the supposed canals of the planet Mars to the imaginations\r\nof astronomers, it is safe to say that Egypt bears off the palm for\r\nworks of this description.  The ancients knew of their value, and\r\nenormous cuts were made by the help of slave labour, and were left to\r\nsurvive the rolling away of centuries, and where not duly cared for, and\r\nfilled up by the drifting sand, have lain ready to be cleared out,\r\ndeepened and brought into use again.  These have been added to, till at\r\nthe present time it can be said that the system of canals connected with\r\nthe main river for the purposes of portage and for perennial irrigation\r\ncannot be equalled anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe barrage of the Delta is of incalculable value, since by closing the\r\nsluices the head of water is raised and irrigation made more easy, while\r\nthe works of this description lately carried out upon the Nile at\r\nAssiout and Assouan conserve immense bodies of water, which have\r\nformerly flowed regularly down to the sea, carrying with them millions\r\nof tons of fertilising mud or warp, with the equatorial washings of the\r\nrich, untrodden land.  This solution of plant-making soil has gone on\r\ndownward towards the sea from untold ages, forming by degrees the vast\r\nDelta, beside that which was lost to the service of man, merely choking\r\nup and making shallow the many watercourses into which the Nile waters\r\nhave been broken up, and altering the positions of ancient ports and\r\nmaritime cities now distant from the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nA good old English gardener once said, \"You can't grow things well\r\nwithout plenty of manure,\" and this the Egyptians found out years ago.\r\nThey have the great advantage of the fertile mud deposited by the river,\r\nbut to bring it to its highest state of production land seems to ask for\r\nthe crude form of animal plant food as well as the vegetable and\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that there must be a great deal of vegetable\r\nfertilisation swept down by the Nile in a decayed state from the forests\r\nand swamps of Central Africa, but Egypt itself is no land of forests and\r\nthat wondrous help to vegetation, leaf mould, may be said to be entirely\r\nabsent, while the ordinary animal excreta so carefully collected in most\r\ncivilised countries for application to the land is sadly wanted and\r\nneglected here for farm and garden purposes.  It is carefully collected,\r\nit is true, and dried; but here, in a country where wood is exceedingly\r\nscarce, it is used for fuel.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the resulting ashes are regarded as of little worth, whereas\r\nthey contain, in a mineral form, so many of the constituents of\r\nvegetable life that, if preserved, they would be most valuable.  In\r\nfact, the fellaheen look upon the ashes in the same light as they are\r\nregarded here in England, if they are thought of at all, as a coarse\r\ningredient to mix with a clayey soil to lighten it in the place of sand.\r\nBut in these islands there is the excuse that for the most part they\r\nare coal ashes and wanting in fertilising powers.  Where they are wood\r\nor vegetable ashes the English cultivator has long known their value\r\nfrom the extent to which they are impregnated with potash.  Still, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the ash of the Egyptian fuel, though not returned\r\nto the earth in a well-thought-out and business-like way, does play its\r\npart to some extent in restoring exhausted soil.\r\n\r\nThe term \"farmyard manure\" is common of application, but an English\r\nfarmer would look at it in amazement and not know his good old friend\r\nagain, for the Egyptian farmyard manure seems to have been invented by\r\nthe sanitarians of our dry earth system, being composed of desiccated\r\nNile mud which has been carefully spread over the floors of the\r\ncattle-sheds as litter wherever bullocks, cows, horses, sheep, etc., are\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nIn this fine, dry state, the once mud, now earth, is remarkably\r\nabsorbent and sweetening; most healthy, too, for the animals, who are\r\nnot seen here trampling nearly knee deep in the soon-made foetid swamp\r\nof a country crew-yard.  Moreover the earth is frequently removed--to be\r\nkept lying in the manure heap for about a year to mature, when it is\r\nconsidered ready for use, and the cattle enclosures and sheds of a farm\r\nare remarkably wholesome and clean.\r\n\r\nThis dry mud is one great source of plant food for the farm, but it is\r\nlargely supplemented by what the Egyptians term _coufri_, or _sabbakh_.\r\nThis is not always available, and depends upon the position of the farm;\r\nbut there are parts of the Delta where, to all appearance, the tract\r\nbeing reclaimed or taken up for bringing into cultivation is so much\r\nlevel, or nearly level, land, with a mound or slight elevation here and\r\nthere where the winds have drifted the sand apparently to a considerable\r\ndepth.  Except to the eye of the experienced there is nothing to show\r\nthat flourishing cities and villages have existed there in the past; but\r\nmany of these slight elevations are the sites where teeming populations\r\nonce existed, and all has gone back, with some few exceptions--dust to\r\ndust.  The exceptions are where the spade of the fellah comes upon the\r\nremains of a tomb or priestly edifice, these, as is well-known, being\r\nthe lasting part of man's work, which are being discovered constantly\r\neven now, with their builders', sculptors', and painters' handiwork\r\nlooking, when the sand has been removed, almost as fresh and uninjured\r\nas if they were the traces of two or three generations back instead of\r\nhaving been buried many centuries ago.\r\n\r\nThese solid remains, or ruins, may be comparatively few; but in all\r\nprobability have been surrounded by an enormous population, whose\r\nhouses, originally built of the sun-dried Egyptian brick, have in the\r\ncourse of time gone back, like everything animal that surrounded them,\r\nto a rough earth ready for the worker's spade, which digs up from an\r\nalmost inexhaustible mine--with nothing to tell of the past but a few\r\nbroken shards--a splendid fertiliser for the farm.\r\n\r\nBut this _coufri_ manure requires discrimination in its use, too strong\r\nan application being likely to prove hurtful to a crop, seeing that\r\nanalysis shows that its plant-feeding qualities are due to the salts it\r\ncontains--sometimes as much as 12 per cent, of salt, soda, ammonia,\r\nsaltpetre, phosphates, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe value to an English farmer of such a mine of artificial chemical\r\nmanure as this may be conceived, and it would make the eyes brighten of\r\none here who strengthens his land by applications of marl, or else has\r\nto content himself with a top dressing of chalk from some pit sunk in a\r\ncorner of his holding.\r\n\r\nFairly plentiful still in Egypt, there must, of course, be a limit to\r\nthis supply.  The taking up of land is going steadily on, and\r\nconsequently the remains of city after city have been and are being\r\nrapidly used up, thus necessitating the establishment of plans upon a\r\npractical basis for the restoration of land which should not be\r\nexhausted by heavy crops without the cultivator making a proper return.\r\nOne of our students of agriculture, in a public address, deals largely\r\nwith the necessity for the dissemination of a practical knowledge of the\r\nneeds of the land.  He speaks of the great waste of fertilising matter\r\nin the way in which the refuse stalks of two of the greatest crops of\r\nthe Delta--cotton and sugar-cane--are burned in the furnaces of engines,\r\nfor which purpose they are most valuable when it is taken into\r\nconsideration that fuel wood is a rarity and coal a luxury of exorbitant\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nBut after burning, so ignorant have the people been, that the tons upon\r\ntons in the aggregate of this rich ash from the engine fires which\r\nconsume the refuse of the enormous crops of sugar-cane annually grown,\r\nhave been looked upon as comparatively valueless, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the ash contains almost all that is required for the growth of so\r\nexhaustive a crop, and it has been either cast away or sold for a\r\ntrifle, to be used up in the manufacture of bricks.  He adds, in words\r\nfull of pregnant meaning, that even the fertile alluvium of the Nile\r\nValley cannot long sustain this treatment without exhaustion, in spite\r\nof the much that is done by the feeding off and ploughing in of the\r\nleguminous crops, which play a great part in giving back what has been\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nFarms here, too, are often found with a large dovecote, as alluded to in\r\nthe description of the Khedive's estates; for the Egyptian cultivator\r\nhas a fine substitute for the guano of the Peruvian Chincha Islands in\r\nthat of the pigeons which are kept in flocks for the sake of this strong\r\nfertiliser.  Undoubtedly they must take severe toll from the crops,\r\nwhether green or fit for harvesting, though perhaps this is\r\ncounterbalanced by the fact that the birds must gain a good subsistence\r\nupon the grain that would be wasted or go back to the soil, so much\r\nbeing shed at ingathering time in consequence of the heat.\r\n\r\nThis carefully-saved fertiliser is used by the Egyptian for applying to\r\nvegetables and such productions as water melons and other plants of the\r\ngourd family, which depend much for their size on stimulation.\r\n\r\nThe application of special commercial manures to Egyptian crops may be\r\nsaid to be still in the experimental stage.  On the richest and most\r\nfertile soils they are not required, but on the poorer soils their\r\neffect is very apparent.  For the cotton crop, superphosphate and\r\nnitrate of soda, in the proportion of 3 to 4 hundredweights\r\nsuperphosphate to 1.25 hundredweight nitrate of soda, mixed and applied\r\nto an acre, give a profitable return in an increased yield of cotton.\r\nOther manures, such as potash, have been tried, but did not prove\r\nsatisfactory.  Sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda give good results\r\non poor land if applied to the wheat crop.  As not more than half enough\r\nfarmyard manure can be produced on large estates for fertilising the\r\nvarious crops, attention will be turned to chemicals should they prove\r\nto be profitable after exhaustive experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been written about the water navigation of this country,\r\na few words may be said respecting the means of conducting the land\r\ntraffic.  In the past the great river and its Delta mouths, supplemented\r\nby the canals, formed the main roads for the conveyance of produce.  Now\r\nthe iron track has begun to make its way, and the long creeping trains\r\nof trucks and carriages may be seen gliding over the plain, drawn by the\r\nmighty power of old George Stephenson's invention, though in this hot\r\ncountry the familiar trail of soft whitish grey vapour is often wanting,\r\ndying out at once as it does in the rays of the ardent sun.  In\r\naddition, Egypt is being treated as Britain was some two thousand years\r\nago by the Romans, who well grasped the value of a good trunk road, and\r\nwhile those were formed for military purposes and the holding in check\r\nof the subject race, these in connection with the Khedive's peaceful\r\nrule and for the advance of agriculture are devoted to the carrying of\r\nproduce from market to market, or to some railway station, and this,\r\ntoo, at much less cost than in the olden days, when most of the grain\r\nwas borne from the place of its growth upon camel back, or slung in bags\r\non either side of the patient, vigorous, and handsome donkeys which are\r\nraised in this country.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Morning Post_ writes:\r\n\r\n  While Upper Egypt is nowhere more than a fertile strip, bordered by\r\n  two deserts, the comparatively large area of the Delta, its\r\n  intersection by a multitude of canals, and the absence of a large\r\n  system of metalled roads, have long rendered necessary an improvement\r\n  of communications in the interest both of the fellaheen and of the\r\n  European or Levantine landowners.  Agricultural roads offer but a\r\n  partial solution of the difficulties caused by these conditions;\r\n  donkeys, mules, and camels are still highly useful, and will long be\r\n  extensively used for the transport of commodities over a short\r\n  distance, or in cases where time is no object to the transporter; but\r\n  it is unnecessary to dilate on the defects of animal compared with\r\n  mechanical transport.  Branches of the Nile and the canals which in\r\n  the maps cover the Delta with such a network of blue lines are also of\r\n  great value, but the number of canals which are perennially navigable\r\n  is limited, and the canal barge is nowhere renowned for speed, while\r\n  sailing boats cannot use certain canals at all in the dry season, and\r\n  their use of others is often attended by the risk of grounding.\r\n\r\n_En passant_, Mr Wallace mentions a singular fact in connection with\r\nthe making of the trunk roads.  In Europe we are accustomed to see them\r\nkept as level as is consistent with the cost of making, and raised above\r\nthe level while provided with proper drains to carry off the too\r\nabundant water.  Here it has been found that to give the road much rise\r\nabove the surrounding levels is a mistake, in consequence of the large\r\namount of salt the unredeemed districts contain.  The salt rises to the\r\nsurface, forming an efflorescence as in the American plains, and\r\nespecially in the stiff lands it has a tendency to interfere with the\r\nways of nature, where the particles adhere together, causing them to\r\nfall apart in the shape of dust, which is one of the objectionable\r\nfeatures of an Egyptian road.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has read about Egypt will recall matters full of suggestion\r\nof likely difficulties regarding the keeping open of a road, while those\r\nwho have travelled through the country have much to say about the\r\nprevalence of dust.  How many discoveries in the past have been made of\r\nwondrous relics that have lain buried for ages covered in deeply--and\r\npreserved--by the drifting dust or sand!  And, with regard to this\r\ndrifting, attention has been drawn by Mr Wallace, in his agricultural\r\naddress, to a singular physical fact in connection with the shifting of\r\nthe sand.  This might be expected to follow, on the whole, the course of\r\nthe prevailing winds, and be carried mainly in their direction; but\r\nthere are singular variations, probably due to local waves or currents\r\nof air near the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn one considerable portion of the land of Goshen the sand is swept from\r\nsouth to north, while in another part, along the west bank of the Nile,\r\nat the north of Cairo, its direction is from east to west.  But a great\r\ndeal of the raising and drifting of the finer portions of the earth is\r\ndependent upon whether the wind be moisture-laden or the reverse.  If\r\nthe air be moist, a breeze blowing at the rate of, say, four miles an\r\nhour from the north will have no effect upon the deep dust, while one\r\nfrom the arid south, possessed of about half the other's force, will\r\nraise the almost impalpable soil in clouds.\r\n\r\nBut, as elsewhere, now that Egypt is awakening from her long slumber,\r\nthe sand is giving way to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Morning Post_ gives some very terse and\r\nexhaustive accounts of the railway system now extending through the\r\nDelta, and dwells upon the fact that the agricultural light railways--\r\nsimilar to the one mentioned earlier in these pages, made by the Khedive\r\nto his estates near Cairo--have been a distinct success, and he goes on\r\nto say that:\r\n\r\n  The broad-gauge State railways of the Egyptian Delta may be roughly\r\n  compared with the sticks of a fan.  Converging at Cairo, the\r\n  headquarters of the railway administration, and the goal of the\r\n  provincial lines, the railways diverge to Alexandria, to Dessouk in\r\n  the north of the Delta, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile, to\r\n  Damietta, to Salahieh in the north-east, and to Ismailia.  Several\r\n  lines link the important towns on these branches; for example,\r\n  Mansourah is connected with the Salahieh line, and a railway along the\r\n  coast connects Alexandria and Rosetta; but large areas, notably in the\r\n  crowded Menoufieh Province, in Beherah, and in the north-east of the\r\n  Delta, lacked facilities for rapid transmission of goods and\r\n  passengers to the larger towns served by the State lines until the\r\n  advent of the agricultural railways.  It would be unnecessary and\r\n  unprofitable to enumerate all the agricultural lines which have been\r\n  constructed in the last few years.  Their distribution may be\r\n  understood if, returning to the fan metaphor, they are regarded as\r\n  threads running between and generally connecting the diverging sticks\r\n  of the fan of State lines.\r\n\r\nSo successful have these lines been that applications have been made for\r\npermission regarding the construction of fresh railways to extend in\r\nvarious directions for over another three hundred miles, most of these\r\nbeing in the Menoufieh Province, where desert land is being reclaimed.\r\nMr Gunn's report gives the mileage covered since 1896, when the\r\nconcessions were granted:\r\n\r\nIn 1897 there were fifty-four miles of railway open, in 1899 430 miles,\r\nand in 1902 673.  Within a year or two there will be at least one\r\nthousand miles open for traffic.\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, one of the principal uses made of these lines of rails\r\nis for the conveyance of the ancient deposits of _sabbakh_ or _coufri_\r\nfrom district to district--the rich fertiliser to the comparatively\r\nbarren lands--the old-world traces of civilisation to the new, to parts\r\nof Egypt which have been written down for ages as desert, but which are\r\nnow found to become great suppliers of produce that can be easily\r\nconsigned to the many markets opening up at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the Delta is a splendid region for settlement for any\r\nyoung agriculturist who possesses health, energy, and a natural tendency\r\ntowards those industrious habits peculiar to the successful men of our\r\ncountry, who have always been willing to metaphorically and really take\r\noff their coats and do whatever is necessary by way of example.  To\r\nsucceed in Egypt we must take it for granted that he possesses moderate\r\nmeans, or, say, very moderate means, just sufficient to make a small\r\ncommencement by hiring; or, far better, by the purchase of land, which\r\ncan now safely be done with good legal security and at a price that\r\nbefore long will in all probability bound upwards to double or even\r\nquadruple its present figure.  But the thoroughly good sterling advice\r\nof the authority already quoted--advice similar in nature has often been\r\nbefore given to intending settlers in Australia--is that a year at least\r\nshould first be spent in gaining a knowledge of the country, while\r\nlearning a sufficiency of the common language to enable a man to direct\r\nthe labourers who will be under him in their field work.  And, what is\r\nof equal importance, the intending settler, however great may have been\r\nhis experience, should be ready to cast aside prejudice in favour of his\r\nown preconceived opinions, and studiously take note of why this or that\r\ncourse is followed out by old cultivators; he must learn that amidst a\r\ngreat deal of chaff that he may cast aside there are many grains of good\r\nsound wheat--otherwise, excellent dearly bought bits of experience.\r\n_Festina lente_ is a grand old Roman proverb, and the newcomer to Egypt\r\nwill gain in the end by not being in too great a hurry to start.\r\n\r\nUnlike the British farmer, the agriculturist in Egypt has at hand an\r\nabundant supply of labour.  Housed in the mud huts or sun-dried brick\r\nhouses adjoining the estates, the labourer is at all hours ready to\r\nrespond to the demand.  He receives one or two acres of land let at a\r\nreduced rental; he is a day labourer only, and can absent himself at\r\npleasure to attend to his craft.  His wage varies from sixpence to\r\ntenpence per day of ten hours in summer and eight hours in winter.  He\r\nprovides his own food.\r\n\r\nIn disposition this peasant is contented, good-natured, not resentful,\r\nand of good physique.  He is also very untruthful, unreliable at his\r\nwork, lazy, cunning, and unconscionable as to the quality and quantity\r\nof the task he is put to--in short, a thorough eye-servant.  He requires\r\nconstant supervision, when he will do good work under a trying sun.  He\r\npromises fair, but performs badly.  If he commits a fault and is\r\nquestioned as to how it happened, one can invariably depend upon his\r\ntelling an untruth.  When working on his own plot he is most diligent,\r\nbut his methods are not always the best, and he does not get the full\r\nbenefit from the soil, owing to want of intelligence as to the rules of\r\ngood husbandry.  On a large estate, should extra hands be wanted for a\r\nspecial occasion, a hundred to two hundred men can be had on one night's\r\nnotice being given--a delightful state of affairs in cases of emergency,\r\nthough here the farmer does not often suffer from his hay or corn crops\r\nbeing unharvested through the redundance of rain.\r\n\r\nA large percentage of the fellaheen are perfectly illiterate, which\r\naccounts for their want of readiness to take up the initiative.  They\r\nhave no thirst for knowledge and love in agricultural matters to keep\r\nrunning in the old rut.  Exactness, tidiness, and pride in his work are\r\nqualities very rarely found in a fellah.  Slovenliness in the\r\nperformance of duties is characteristic of the paid day labourer, and to\r\na lesser degree when working on his own account.  In Britain, for\r\ninstance, where do we find the breeder of stock who excels his\r\nneighbours except in the shrewd farmer who, at great trouble and study,\r\nand by patient experimenting, attains to success?  Not only so, but he\r\nis like the leaven which leaveneth the whole lump by raising the\r\nstandard of a district.  The apathy of the fellah is shown in the lack\r\nof breeding in horses, cattle, and sheep in Egypt, which is due to want\r\nof selecting suitable sires, care in rearing, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe soil responds to thorough tillage in a marked degree, but too little\r\ncare is bestowed upon this question of cultivation, as the fellah is\r\nprone to scamp his work and leave part of his land solid--that is, not\r\nthoroughly stirred.  When exposed to the sun the soil cracks and opens\r\ninto fissures, sometimes as wide as five inches.  The fellah is often,\r\ntoo, careless in providing a good bed for the seed, and irregular\r\ngermination is the result.  If the land is judiciously watered and\r\ntimeously ploughed in a friable condition, it can be brought to a fine\r\ntilth without much extra trouble.  As it is all soil--nothing in the\r\nshape of a bad subsoil exists, as in some parts of Great Britain--deep\r\ncultivation is thoroughly beneficial, bringing, as it does, unexhausted\r\nsoil to the top.  Generally in the preparation of the land for the\r\ncotton crop, with its deep-searching roots, a depth of twelve inches is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nDoubtless much of the apathy of the labouring man amongst the fellaheen\r\nis due, as in the case of the rice-feeding Hindoo, to his being to so\r\ngreat an extent a vegetarian.  With him the staff of life consists\r\nprincipally of an exceedingly hard kind of bread, baked almost to\r\nbiscuit, and composed of maize, or dourra, the small-grained millet; and\r\nthe result of the fellaheen housewife's efforts in this kind of food\r\npreparation necessitates dipping or soaking in water before the bread\r\ncan be partaken of at a meal.\r\n\r\nBut in such a splendid garden land as Egypt, where cultivated produce\r\nattains maturity at so rapid a rate, and where with careful management\r\nand such a spring and summer-like climate two or even three crops of\r\nvegetables can be obtained in a year, it may easily be supposed that the\r\npeasant can provide himself with a constant supply of green food; and he\r\ncertainly takes advantage of his position, indulging freely in the\r\nordinary vegetables common in the gardens of the West, and supplementing\r\nthem with the delicious green maize so popular with the American people.\r\n\r\nThis latter grain is one of the staple foods, when it has come to\r\nmaturity, of the inhabitants of the Delta.  It is ground into a coarse\r\nflour, and mingled with a small proportion of barley; while in addition,\r\nto give flavour and a slight stimulus to the digestive organs which are\r\nbrought to bear upon one of the hardest grains in assimilation, a small\r\nportion of the peculiar clover-like, many-seeded plant, fenugreek, is\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nMaize gives place to a great extent in Upper Egypt to millet or dourra\r\namongst the poorer orders; but the better-class work-people, who earn\r\nmuch higher wages than the agricultural labourer, are now taking to the\r\ngeneral use of wheaten bread.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ordinary fellah partakes of so simple a diet, and may be\r\nwanting in energy, loving as he does to glide through life in the same\r\nold groove that was formed by his forefathers, he is a well-built,\r\nhealthy, muscular individual, and is not to be beaten by any coolie as a\r\nworker under a torrid sun.  Much of his work consists of raising water\r\nfor irrigation, and if statistics could be produced as to the number of\r\ngallons that he sends trickling amongst the roots of the crop, or\r\nmoistening the land previously in their preparation, ordinary figures\r\nwould almost fail.  Suffice it to say that it is immense.  Even now he\r\nclings often of necessity to the old, old shadoof--that which is\r\nrepresented in the engraving--which, in spite of its Egyptian name, is\r\nonly our old friend of the suburban brickfield, a long pole balanced\r\nupon a post in scale beam fashion, with a bucket at one end of the pole,\r\na weight at the other, equal to that of the water which is raised from\r\nsomewhere below for pouring into a receptacle, ready to be dipped again,\r\nperhaps, and sent higher by means of another shadoof farther up.\r\n\r\nThe worker of this primitive water distributer, in his cotton robe, is\r\none of the commonest objects seen upon the banks.  The photograph well\r\ndepicts the sturdy fellah at his task.  In addition, there is the\r\nold-world sakieh, a much more complicated affair; for here, in the past,\r\nprimitive ingenuity turned its hand to mechanical construction, and\r\nproduced after much toil the manual labour-saving and ox- or\r\nbuffalo-enlisting water-wheel, working after the fashion of one of our\r\nriver dredges, but clumsy of the clumsy, and having, in place of the\r\nmetal scoops, so many earthenware pots, held in their places to the\r\nperiphery of the water-wheel by as many cords, as will be seen in the\r\nengraving.  Still, it is effective in its way, and the yoked oxen which\r\nsupply the motive power that turns the heavy wheels raise vast\r\nquantities of water year after year.  The sakieh is quaint, old-world,\r\nand picturesque, and it has served its purpose so well, for who can say\r\nhow far back in the past, that it never seems to have occurred to the\r\nlower order of Egyptian mind that any improvement could be made.  That\r\nhas been left to the West, and now that under the present progressive\r\nforward movement of Egyptian agriculture European, and especially\r\nBritish, water-raising and distributing machines are being utilised, the\r\nfate of the sakieh seems to be that sooner or later it will merely live\r\nto be spoken of as a curiosity, only seen in some artist's\r\nrepresentation of the past.\r\n\r\nThe fellah's habitation has not varied with the years; as in antiquity,\r\nso now.  The primitive clay hut is simplicity itself.  As it is figured\r\nin the quaint tomb pictures, so it is to-day in the suburbs and\r\nvillages--its furniture a wooden chest or two, its cooking utensils a\r\nfew earthen pots.  But his hut is principally his sleeping place, for\r\nhis life is pretty well passed beneath the broad canopy of heaven.  He\r\nrises with the dawn to begin his day's work at the plough, or to handle\r\nhis heavy hoe.  At another time the demands of the crops for water or\r\nfor the mud-laden fertilising contents of the great stream, take him to\r\nthe shadoof or to guide the bullock or buffalo turning the water-wheel.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, the fellah's wife is the soul of his humble home.  She\r\ntoils busily and patiently through the duties of her little domestic\r\ncentre, cares for her elders, cooks, and finds time to feed the cattle\r\nand collect the sun-dried fuel from off the parched soil, to come back\r\nmarching homeward, strong and statuesque, bearing the piled-up basket\r\nupon her head; while it is she who, while her lord is busily lowering\r\nand raising the shadoof, descends knee deep into the river or canal to\r\nfill the great, heavy, amphora-like earthen pot and then bear it back to\r\nher home, classically picturesque in her drapery as she balances the\r\nclumsy vessel upon shoulder or head, and bears the life-giving fluid\r\nonward with a steady, easy swing.  It is she who makes the dourra, or\r\nmaize bread, and shapes and stitches the cotton clothing, which is the\r\nonly wear of all her circle.  Unlike her sister of the city, she does\r\nnot shrink so much from the gaze of the other sex, but still to some\r\nextent keeps up the tradition; though wearing no veil she will hold up a\r\nportion of her drapery at the coming of the passer-by, or perhaps only\r\nplace her hand before her mouth.\r\n\r\nWoman-like, in spite of her menial toil, she believes in personal care,\r\nand her long black hair is carefully dressed and glistens with Palma\r\nChristi oil.  She paints, too, as of old, the marks appearing upon her\r\nchin and forehead, while a string of attractive glass beads decorates\r\nand hangs suspended from her neck.\r\n\r\nThe olden Egyptian costume is that principally affected by the fellah.\r\nIt consists of a closely-fitting cap of felt or cotton and a long robe\r\nof the latter material, deeply dyed of an indigo blue.  Shirt and\r\ndrawers are of the same material, while in some cases a young buck\r\namongst his people will adorn himself, like Joseph of old, in a vest of\r\nmany colours, borrowed from the Arab, the Persian, or the Turk.  As\r\nabove intimated, the fellah believes in a life of leisure, and finds it\r\nrather difficult to make the first start at his daily toil.\r\n\r\nIn the olden days the lot of the fellah was not quite so happy as it\r\nmight have been.  He suffered from enforced labour, and does not seem to\r\nhave had much chance of appeal.  But he had one notable thing in his\r\nfavour, for a river when in flood is subject to having huge portions of\r\nits banks undermined and swept away in a state of muddy solution; and,\r\nas was frequently the case, the peasant cultivator, who for the sake of\r\nthe irrigation had his holding as near the bank as he could contrive to\r\nget, was often a great sufferer, being in the possession before the\r\nflood of a considerable strip of cultivated land, while after the\r\ninundation it was a minus quantity, leaving him to begin life again.\r\nHere, however, the law of the land was very equitable upon his behalf,\r\ngiving him liberty to go either up or down stream to select an equal\r\nquantity of the land he had lost that was new and unappropriated, and no\r\none said him nay.\r\n\r\nAnd now, thanks to the just and easy state of the Government, the native\r\nworking Egyptian is far better off with regard to his condition than he\r\nappears to have been at any time in the past.  Prosperity surrounds him,\r\nand the lesser holders of land, say of from four to ten feddans or\r\nacres, rapidly grow well-to-do and distance the larger proprietors.  The\r\nextent now of the land under cultivation is vastly in excess of what it\r\nwas.  The people are growing more energetic--those of the better class--\r\nand are learning fast, while the spirit of emulation is increasing\r\namongst them as they waken up to what modern civilisation will achieve.\r\nTheir Government, too, is working hard on their behalf, a college having\r\nbeen established at Ghizeh for the purpose of instructing the sons of\r\nnative landowners and of the working fellaheen class in more advanced\r\nagriculture, fitting them in the knowledge necessary for the prosecution\r\nof agriculture according to the best forms, the proper rotations of\r\ncrops, selections of fertilisers, natural and chemical, and, above all,\r\nstockbreeding and all that has been learned of late in connection with\r\nthe dairy.\r\n\r\nIn brief, much as has been said of the Egypt of the past being the\r\ngarden of the world, it bids fair to become in the future so great a\r\ncontrast that old Egypt will pale into insignificance in the bright\r\nlight of the new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\n*Horses*.--There are no heavy horses used here, such as the Shire or\r\nClydesdale, as the ploughing is done by oxen.  The Arab horses--or they\r\nmight be classed as ponies--measure from fourteen to fourteen and a half\r\nhands high.  They are not of great substance, but light in the bone,\r\nleggy, narrow-chested, though sure-footed and hardy.\r\n\r\nHorse breeding is not attended with much success, as regards the\r\nproduction of high-class stock, and re-mounts for the Army and Police\r\nhave to be purchased in Syria.  The stories one reads while at school\r\nabout the Arab and his steed receive a rude shock when one witnesses the\r\nunmerciful way in which the Arab overloads and whips his horses.  They\r\nare not true horsemen, a fact which is apparent in their methods of\r\ntraining horses to harness.\r\n\r\nThe Government has supplied stud horses to various districts to try and\r\nimprove the breed.  On the farm horses are used for carting, etc.  They\r\nare fed on barley and broken straw (_tibn_), the former a bad form of\r\nprovender for the horse, unless its harshness be ameliorated by\r\ncrushing.\r\n\r\n*Cattle*.--The work-bullocks are strong, docile animals, and do the\r\nploughing, threshing, raising water, etc.  One pair is yoked to a\r\nplough.  Four pairs are sufficient to work a farm of one hundred acres.\r\nTheir daily feed is nine pounds of beans and twenty-five pounds of\r\nstraw.  The beans are split, and are eaten uncooked.\r\n\r\nMost estates have to purchase their oxen, as very few cows are kept for\r\nbreeding purposes.  The fellaheen keep one or two, and rear the young\r\nbulls.  Where the soil is richest the cattle are best.  In summer the\r\nfellah allows his young stock to get into poor condition, and this has\r\nan effect on their growth.  He has--amongst many other things--still to\r\nlearn about early maturity.  Within recent years work-bullocks have\r\nrisen enormously in price, owing to more butcher's meat being consumed\r\nby the fellaheen and the European visitors.  The price of a pair of good\r\nbullocks is 45 pounds at the age of four years.  These cattle resemble\r\nthose of the Channel Islands, but are larger.  They are very often\r\ndeficient in depth of rib and chest measurement, hollow-backed, and\r\nnarrow across the loins, as well as leggy, and they show want of\r\nstrength of forearm.  These are some of the defects which may be\r\neradicated by care in selecting, mating, etc.\r\n\r\nCows are kept and bred from by the fellaheen, who rear the young bulls,\r\nwhile, as we have seen, the cows are used for ploughing.  They are not a\r\nbreed of deep milkers, but the milk is rich in butter fat, 5 per cent,\r\nbeing common; and sixteen pounds of milk will give two pounds of cream,\r\nor one pound of butter, which is in demand at from 1 shilling 6 pence to\r\n2 shillings per pound.\r\n\r\nCrossing with European bulls has been tried lately, with a measure of\r\nsuccess.  Some idea of the characters of these animals may be gathered\r\nby comparing the illustrations representing both buffalo and ordinary\r\nbull with the experimental cross-bred animals reared upon the Khedivial\r\nfarms.  It has been found that crosses between Fribourg bulls (Swiss)\r\nand native cows improve the milking qualities and also produce an animal\r\nwith better points of breeding, without diminishing the usefulness for\r\ndraught purposes.  Fine specimens are to be seen at the present time\r\nupon the Khedive's farms.  A practice common to the country is that when\r\nthe cow is milked her calf is tied up beside her and allowed afterwards\r\nto partake of its share.  If this rule be not observed, the cow will not\r\ngive up her milk.\r\n\r\n*Buffaloes*.--Large specimens of these peculiar and useful animals have\r\nbeen bred upon the Khedive's stock farm, great enterprise having been\r\nexercised for the purposes of improvement both as draught animals and\r\nfor dairy purposes.  One of the sires is a magnificent bull lately\r\nbrought by his Highness's orders from the Soudan.  Both bulls and cows\r\nare yoked for farm labour in the fields, while the latter, as dairy\r\nstock, are in great favour, their milk being richer in butter-producing\r\nqualities than that of the ordinary dairy cow of Europe.  Eleven pounds\r\nof buffalo milk will churn one pound of butter, but the quality is not\r\nso good, being pale in colour, and oily.  The yield of milk per\r\ntwenty-four hours is about thirty pounds.\r\n\r\n*Donkeys*.--Unlike the despised donkey of England, the ass of Egypt is\r\none of the most useful of animals.  It is a hardy, patient\r\nburden-bearer, but very often ill-treated, notwithstanding its good\r\nservices.  It is employed on the farm for carrying manure in bags slung\r\nacross the back, and is largely used for the saddle.  A well-bred,\r\ngenerously treated donkey is often of a goodly size.\r\n\r\n*Mules*.--These are employed for carting, raising water, and other farm\r\nwork.  They are very strong and useful.\r\n\r\n*Sheep*.--Egypt is not a pastoral country, and but scant attention is\r\npaid to these animals.  They are considered a sort of by-product.  When\r\nattention is paid to them, however, they yield excellent profit.  The\r\nram lambs at five months sell at from sixteen to twenty shillings.  No\r\ncare is bestowed on selection, and breeding from \"weedy\" rams renders\r\nthe stock deficient in quality.  The duties of the shepherd are light,\r\nas the flock is always under his eye at pastures.  A very good idea of\r\nthe Egyptian sheep can be gathered from the illustration.\r\n\r\nBut the time is rapidly approaching when all this may be changed; for\r\nsheep-farming may be looked upon from its double advantage of their\r\nincreasing popularity for food purposes and their value for the\r\nextension of a system of animal manuring, and thus supplying, by feeding\r\noff crops, one of the great wants of the country.  To a great extent the\r\npoor class Egyptian has been a vegetarian, but, with the increase of\r\nriches and prosperity in the country, Mr Wallace in his address speaks\r\nof the growing demand for animal food, especially mutton; while he\r\nreminds his listeners that one of the ways in which an Arab honours his\r\nguest is by furnishing his feast with a whole roast lamb.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet Mohammed, in his sanitary laws to his followers, teaches\r\nthem to partake of mutton, in his wisdom and knowledge of its\r\nsuperiority to the flesh of the ox, which is considered unclean,\r\npointing to the fact that even in his day cattle were known to be\r\naffected with some form of tuberculosis, which might possibly be eaten\r\nand thus imparted to the unfortunate partaker of the unwholesome food.\r\n\r\nA special choice of site for sheep-farming is necessary, as a matter of\r\ncourse; but portions of the country may easily be selected where they\r\ncan be kept with advantage--in the Nubarea, for instance.  For not only\r\nis the land itself undergoing change in its nature, but politically as\r\nwell.  Under the present form of government and the protection to the\r\ncultivator which has been the natural result, the farmer is becoming\r\nfreed from the risks of the past; for, unfortunately, in consequence of\r\na certain inborn notion that has existed among the native Egyptian that\r\neverything he covets may be annexed, it has been found absolutely\r\nnecessary by the grower of sheep to keep an exceedingly sharp eye over\r\nhis tempting flocks, which have had to be dealt with as if they were in\r\nan enemy's land.  Driven into folds at night, this has not been\r\nsufficient; for as there is a want here of that breed of savage dogs\r\nfostered for their protection by the Albanian shepherds, the Egyptian\r\nshepherd has to be supplemented by watchmen ready to stand sentry over\r\nthe flocks by night.\r\n\r\nSheep feeding progresses well during the time of the growing crops; but\r\nas these pass away, that form of farming and feeding which may be looked\r\nupon as quite modern in its application has proved most advantageous to\r\nthe keeper of sheep: we mean the plan which agitated the public mind to\r\nso great an extent a decade or two back--ensilage--when our country rang\r\nwith reports of experimental building of costly silos, or the sinking in\r\nsuitable places of cement-lined tanks in which the newly-cut crops of\r\ngreen cattle food were piled or stacked, rammed down for preservation,\r\nand made into what one facetious writer stigmatised as \"cattle jam.\"\r\nThe idea of the inexperienced was that this treatment of the green grass\r\nor clover would result either in rotting or fermentation, with\r\nspontaneous combustion to follow, as in the case of a too hurriedly made\r\nhay or corn rick in a moist harvest time.  But the operations of Nature\r\nare as wondrous as they are puzzling, and it was found in our own\r\ncountry that the crop preserved in its silo could be kept for a\r\nreasonable length of time, and then cut out in an appetising state,\r\nready for the cattle in a season of scarcity.\r\n\r\nAnswering so well in Europe, with its frequent rains and superabundant\r\nmoisture, it is bound to be successful in comparatively rainless Egypt,\r\nwhere the clover can be cut at the exact necessary period and kept ready\r\nfor use as required--a fact which is likely to give a great impetus to\r\nsheep-raising in such a pastureless country as the Delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nThere is every probability of a small capitalist, one who might begin\r\nwith almost nothing besides so much land and a sufficiency to tide\r\nhimself over the first few months, making a fair success by the\r\nestablishing of a poultry farm.  In England we are favoured every year\r\nwith reports of the trials that have been made in this branch of\r\nfarming; and as a rule it seems that bad weather, the cold, and the cost\r\nof keeping, run away with most of the profits.  Indeed, the writer's\r\nexperience points to the fact that few as yet have made a satisfactory\r\nliving by keeping fowls in this rainy island, while up to the present\r\nday our supplies are kept up by the chickens and eggs taken into market\r\nfrom ordinary farms, or collected by hucksters from the cottages over\r\nwide districts.\r\n\r\nThis applies as much to France as to England, for we are indebted to the\r\nformer country for millions of the eggs with which the metropolis is\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, where there is plenty of room and abundant sunshine, fowls\r\nmight be much improved by the choice of suitable kinds, while some\r\nmanagement would be required as to the means of feeding, though one\r\nsuggestion may be made that, if adopted, ought to prove of great\r\nassistance to the fowl and egg farmer.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity in the growing of grain in Egypt, and this is\r\nnoticeable in the harvesting, the heat of the sun being so great that\r\nthe corn of various kinds ripens with such rapidity that if much of it\r\nbe not cut down and carried in the comparative coolness of the night\r\nmuch of it is shed in the fields and is wasted.  Here is a great\r\nopportunity for the poultry farmer, or the farmer who merely keeps a few\r\nfowls in connection with his general cultivation; for at such times, in\r\na country where double crops prolong the harvest, great numbers of\r\npoultry in kinds would be self-feeding, and far superior in quality to\r\nmany that are brought into the Cairene and Alexandrian markets.\r\n\r\nStill, at the present time the occupation has been much improved, for\r\nnot only are the native markets supplied, but exportation of eggs is on\r\nthe increase.  Far off as Egypt may be, the metropolis is to some extent\r\nsupplied with its produce, but to nothing like the extent that should be\r\nthe case, for the London egg merchants will not buy \"mummies,\" which is\r\nthe cant term for Egyptian eggs, save for about two months in the year,\r\nwhen the European supplies are scarce.\r\n\r\nThis fact--one which is well worthy the attention of poultry farming\r\naspirants--is entirely the fault of the Egyptian grower, for the London\r\nmerchants' complaint is perfectly justifiable.  It is this--that the\r\nEgyptian eggs are exceedingly small, and so badly packed for transit by\r\nthose who seem thoroughly ignorant of the proverbial fact that \"eggs are\r\neggs,\" that the breakage is enormous, while the entire loss falls on the\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nSimilar complaints used to be made regarding the eggs imported into\r\nEurope from Morocco and Algiers, but here those connected with the trade\r\nhave woke up to their shortcomings and introduced better fowls--the\r\nlayers of larger eggs--and have also given greater attention to the\r\npacking of this exceedingly brittle merchandise.  Hence the result has\r\nbeen most satisfactory, and the trade has rapidly increased.  Egypt\r\nbeing, then, in much the same latitude as Morocco and Algiers, there is\r\nno reason whatever why the former country should not improve its\r\nproduction of poultry so as to vastly increase the demand by raising the\r\nquality of its supplies.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists seem very much behindhand in accounting for the terrible\r\ndestruction which comes upon countries from time to time.  Africa, the\r\nancient home of plagues, is only now recovering from that frightful\r\ndevastation which affected grazing animals, the wild as severely as the\r\ndomesticated.  From south to north this great portion of the globe was\r\nswept by the Teutonically-named Rinderpest.  Cattle of all kinds, and\r\nthe droves of antelope-like creatures which roamed the wilds, perished\r\nalmost like vegetation before the hot, sweeping blast of a volcano or\r\nforest fire.  And, though little known outside, Northern Africa has had\r\na trouble that seems to have been special to domesticated birds, a fact\r\nwhich shows that poultry farming in Egypt is not all _couleur de rose_,\r\nand that he who would venture upon such a pursuit enjoys no immunity\r\nfrom risks, but must take his chance with the vegetable and fruit\r\ngrowers who, like those in other countries, have their difficulties to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nOne visitation was productive recently of terrible devastation amongst\r\nfowls.  This was not the familiar \"gapes\" of the British poultry-yard,\r\nbut is described as a kind of cholera, so bad that villages have been\r\nlosing their entire stock, with the natural consequence that the market\r\nprices of poultry and eggs have greatly increased--charges, in fact,\r\nhaving doubled and even trebled.  Experiments have been tried in the\r\ninvestigation of the disease and the manner of treating it, but so far\r\nthe only successful way of dealing with the trouble seems to have been\r\nby isolation.\r\n\r\nBut there appears to be every probability of the disease proving only of\r\na temporary nature, and that the production of poultry will be as easy,\r\nsimple, and remunerative as of old; for, as may easily be understood,\r\npoultry farming is bound to be of vast importance in a hot country.\r\nEvery traveller recalls what a staple food a so-called chicken is in the\r\nWest Indies; while in the vast plains of India almost every native\r\ncottage has its fowls to meet the demand of an enormous consumption.  Of\r\nthe quality the less said the better.  The aim of the possessor of a\r\npoultry-yard in Western Europe is to produce a plump, square,\r\nso-to-speak, solid fowl, broad and full of breast.  The Indian bird\r\nseems to have been gifted by Nature--in merciful consideration of its\r\nbeing, like most gallinaceous birds, short and hollow of wing and a bad\r\nflier, and also of its having to run for its life to escape immolation\r\nand consumption--with an abundance of skinny leg, and it never seems to\r\nhave occurred to the ryot that he might improve the breed.\r\n\r\nEven in civilised Egypt there is much to be done in this direction, and\r\nan ample field is open to the poultry farmer to improve the quality of\r\nthe fowl, with success attending him if he will be content to go\r\nwatchfully to work and make his experiments upon a sound basis, without\r\nbeing too ready to look with contempt upon the experience-taught native\r\nways.\r\n\r\nOne thing is worthy of remark for the benefit of the would-be poultry\r\nfarmer, and that is in connection with the marketing, for it is almost a\r\nrule that no one in Egypt buys a dead fowl.  In Western Europe, of\r\ncourse, the common practice is to send the fatted chickens for sale\r\nplucked and neatly trussed.  In Egypt it is different, from the fear\r\nlest it should have died from natural causes.  The result of this style\r\nof vendition is the repellent way in which poultry are hawked about the\r\nstreets of the town, raising feelings for the need of more\r\nprevention-of-cruelty-to-animals establishments, though it would be hard\r\nwork to interfere with a custom which has a good deal of reason on its\r\nside, for, waiving the possibilities of purchasing a bird that may have\r\nbeen killed by accident, or possibly have died from disease, climatic\r\nreasons must be taken into consideration.  Egypt is at times intensely\r\nhot, and, whatever may be the fancies of epicures in connection with\r\ngame, the gourmet has yet to be found with a preference for having his\r\nchickens \"high.\"\r\n\r\nStill, as aforesaid, there is something repellent in the way in which\r\nthe doomed birds are treated.  In England a Prevention officer soon\r\nsummons the huckster who overcrowds his poultry in a crate and does not\r\nsupply them with food or water; but in Egypt it is one of the common\r\nobjects of the streets to see a bunch of fowls tied together by the legs\r\nand swinging from the vendor's hand, wearily curving up their necks so\r\nas to get their heads in the normal position, while every now and then a\r\ncase may be found where the seller finds that he requires refreshment\r\nand callously throws his load upon the ground, while in Eastern fashion\r\nhe takes his seat at a _cafe_ to sip his cup and smoke a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nIn such a climate as has been described Egypt offers every inducement\r\nfor the planting of fruit trees that are likely to flourish under its\r\nardent sun.  Attempts have been made, and with fair success, but the\r\nraising of fruit has not reached that state of excellence warranted by\r\nfertility and the conditions of the climate.  Examination very soon\r\nshows the reasons for this lack of prosperity, which is clearly the\r\nfault of the Egyptian gardener in his want of system, his easy, careless\r\nindifference, and his clinging to the old-fashioned way of planting a\r\nfruit tree, namely, placing it in a hole in the ground and leaving it to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe first things that strike observers in visiting Egyptian gardens are\r\nthe overcrowding of the trees, the neglect of precautions to keep them\r\nfree from weeds, and in many cases the marked absence of pruning dealt\r\nout judiciously by one who knows a fruit tree and its needs--plenty of\r\nlight and air, the removal of cross growth, and the fostering of bearing\r\nwood, here frequently injured by rank growth.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the Egyptian gardener is as obstinate and conservative as\r\nhis prototype in the western counties of England, who leaves his ancient\r\napple-trees of the orchard to grow one into the other and become covered\r\nwith grey lichen, while he religiously avoids the replacing of old and\r\nunprofitable trees by young ones.\r\n\r\nThe result of experience is--and the knowledge of what the land will do\r\nmakes it certain--that in the following out of this defective system may\r\nbe traced the want of quality, flavour, and quantity of some Egyptian\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nOf these it must be remembered that the settler and commencer of their\r\ncultivation would have to deal with several that are new to him in the\r\nway of growing, as well as those of the cooler parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nEgypt suggests to the reader the ancient civilisation, with its\r\npyramids, temples, and other monuments of its old-time grandeur, the\r\ngreat river, and, above all, the desert; but to come back from these to\r\nthe simple and ordinary pursuit of gardening, the settler would be able\r\nto surround himself, as in California and Florida, but without the\r\nbitter disappointments produced by frosts, with several varieties of the\r\ngolden apples of the Hesperides--oranges, to wit--the sweet, the bitter,\r\nthe deeply tinted blood orange, and the mandarin.  All of them grow well\r\nin Lower Egypt, and produce beautiful and profitable crops of fruit, as\r\nmay be judged by the following.  The sweet and mandarin trees will bear,\r\nupon a good average tree, from three hundred to four hundred oranges\r\neach--that is to say, good, sweet, juicy fruit, and these will sell\r\nreadily wholesale at about two shillings per hundred; while, in the way\r\nof drawbacks for one who expects to make an income from his sales, it\r\nwill be found here that, just as at home, the tree that in one season\r\nbears an exceptionally heavy crop is rather shy in its production in the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe words that follow deserve to be written in italics for the benefit\r\nof those who know the ravages and foulness that come upon an orange tree\r\nin company with the varieties of scale.  There are no insect pests,\r\nneither, as has been intimated, are there frosts to destroy the bloom.\r\n\r\n_. propos_ of this bloom, there is a practice pursued in Egypt which may\r\nseem strange to an English gardener, but which adds largely to the\r\nprofits of the orange grower, and is doubtless beneficial to the tree,\r\nrelieving it as it may from the strain of overbearing.  When the bitter\r\norange is in full flower the trees are shaken, and more than half of the\r\nblossoms are sold for the purpose of distillation.  The essence produced\r\nis used for mixing with drinking water, or for flavouring beverages,\r\nwhile the price received for the petals is about two-pence-halfpenny per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the oranges, which are in season from November until\r\nMarch, and keep fruiting in beautiful repetition, lemons of several\r\nvarieties are grown, and are marketable at the same time of year.  These\r\nare a most popular fruit among the Egyptians, largely utilised as a kind\r\nof seasoning in the preparation of cooked dishes, and also much prized\r\nfor the making of summer beverages in this hot and thirsty land.  These\r\nare even better friends to the gardener growing for the market than\r\noranges, for they are sure croppers, and command a good price.\r\n\r\nAbundance may be written with regard to summer fruits, the list\r\nnumbering apricots, pears, plums, peaches, apples, grapes, figs, the\r\ncustard apple, pomegranate, melon, and banana.  Of these, bananas,\r\napricots, pomegranates, and figs may be classed as the most profitable\r\nfruits of the summer season.  But people accustomed to the English\r\nMoorpark and _Gros Peche_ apricot, which, when well-grown upon a south\r\nwall or in an orchard-house, is one rich bag of reddish amber,\r\ndeliciously flavoured honey-like juice, would be much disappointed in\r\nthe abundant apricots which are produced upon standard trees for the\r\nEgyptian market.  They are finely flavoured, but small, hard, and\r\nfibrous; and an experienced cultivator of fruit trees states that it is\r\nvery probable that the deficiency in quality and the reason that so far\r\nit has not thrived to perfection is, paradoxical as it may sound, that\r\nit matures too quickly, which is another way of saying that the climate\r\nis too fine for it.  Still, there is every reason to believe that\r\nskilful management and choice acclimatisation, or the raising of new\r\nsorts, may result in the production of finer apricots than those now\r\ngrown in England, where in some parts a manifest deterioration has been\r\nin progress, so great that growers are destroying their apricots and\r\nreplacing them with fruit trees more suited to our sunless climate.\r\n\r\nSome years back a novelty made its appearance in the Alexandria\r\ndistrict.  This was a veritable plague of Egypt, though undoubtedly a\r\nvisitant from abroad.  It was a banana disease, which in its inroads\r\nplayed great havoc amongst the plantations.  Scientific examination was\r\nbrought to bear, and the cause was found to be a parasitic nematode\r\nwhich attacked the roots of the plant.\r\n\r\nFortunately the trouble was local, and the infection limited in its\r\narea, while at the present time many of the plantations are free from\r\nthe pest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to peaches, the way is open to the enterprising and clever\r\ncultivator, for with such a constant supply of sunshine much ought to be\r\ndone in the way of growing this queen of fruits.  Many of us here in\r\nEngland, who have to trust to trees laboriously trained against a wall,\r\nor spread out and tied in to wires at the cost of many a back and neck\r\nache, beneath the sloping glass of an orchard-house, have read with\r\nwatering mouths of the standard trees of the United States, where the\r\nfallen peaches are gathered up in barrowfuls and considered of no\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nAbundance rules there, and possibly it may be that this is due to the\r\nintensely hot summers of the States and their frigidly cold winters; for\r\nthis seems to be the nature of the climate in the country from which the\r\npeach sprang and took its Latin name, _Persica_; for there, following\r\nupon the summer heats, winter comes down from the mountains intensely\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThis balance is wanting in Egypt, where, so far, peaches have not proved\r\nto be a success.  The trees grow well and bear fruit that is fairly\r\nlarge in size, but does not possess the fine aromatic, juicy flavour of\r\na well-matured English peach grown upon a wall and only protected during\r\nthe time of frost, those raised under glass, save in size and\r\nappearance, never approaching the open-air fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian peaches are hard and fibrous, as well as wanting in the\r\npiquant bitter almond flavour so much esteemed.  Possibly the selection\r\nof better kinds may make a great change in the hands of careful\r\ncultivators, but in common fairness it is right to say that the\r\nsuccessful production of this favourite fruit in Egypt is open to doubt.\r\n\r\nSo far, too, another stone fruit, the plum, is not extensively grown,\r\nwhile the plums produced in the Egyptian garden cannot compare with\r\nthose imported from Europe.  But this fruit is not such an aristocrat\r\namong the luscious beauties of the garden as the exacting peach, and\r\nthere is nothing to prevent, either in soil or climate, a finer quality\r\nbeing grown in the Delta.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is the selection of new and suitable varieties,\r\naccompanied by careful watching of results; in fact, the intelligent\r\nmanagement of a good experimental gardener, not one akin to that of\r\nEgypt, who selects with extreme conservatism the easiest way to his\r\ndesired ends.  He consequently devotes his time to those fruits which\r\nflourish easily and well.  His attention has been given principally to\r\nthe growing of the _citrus_ family, to the exclusion of such fruits as\r\npears and plums, which are imported from Syria and Turkey.  In fact, in\r\nspite of the possibilities of the Delta, how great is the want of\r\nenterprise may readily be seen when it is stated that the value of the\r\nimports of fruit may amount to many thousand pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our two most home-like and familiar fruits--apples and\r\npears--do not succeed here, the climate being far too hot.  Pears have a\r\nvery small share of the land, and the fruit is not of the best quality.\r\nBut while it is doubtful about the apple, this doubt ought not to extend\r\nto the pear, which is a lover of heat, and, as regards the better sorts,\r\ndelicate and tender in its constitution.  There can be no doubt that if\r\na careful selection of some of the best French and Belgian varieties\r\nwere introduced, a fair meed of success would be the result, for it\r\nseems almost contrary to reason that such kinds as the fragrant _Doyenne\r\nde Comice_ and _Glou Morceau_, which fail as standards in the inclemency\r\nof an English season, and crack and speck if they are not protected by a\r\nwall, should not succeed in Egypt if they are given a fair trial.\r\n\r\nNot that there is much need for experiment in a country which can grow\r\nits grapes gloriously in the open air, the vines not asking for the help\r\nof glass.  Some half dozen varieties are produced in Egypt, and flourish\r\nwell under treatment of the simplest kind.  The cultivation of the vine\r\nextends over the whole of the province of Fayoum.  In this latter\r\ndistrict a white grape, called after its habitat the \"Fayoumi,\" is the\r\nfavourite in the market, and it is the earliest that ripens.  The\r\nberries are medium sized, but the flavour is excellent and the fruit\r\nvery juicy.\r\n\r\nThere is little question of training or trellis work, for, somewhat\r\nafter the fashion of the vineyards in France, the vines are grown as\r\nbushes of about two feet high; and the result, though not the production\r\nof the bunches of the Vale of Eshcol, is still abundance.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties are grown in the Delta and Cairo districts, namely\r\n\"Roumy\"--a kind derived from Greece--and \"Shawishi.\"  Here, as opposed\r\nto the cultivation in the province of Fayoum, the vines are mostly\r\ntrained on lattice work so as to form what the old gardeners called a\r\npergola, or covered way.  Both these varieties are heavy croppers,\r\nbearing bunches whose berries are of a greenish red, while the flavour\r\nis very good.\r\n\r\nEgypt is a land of vines and vineyards, much space being given to the\r\ncultivation of the grape, though not for the purposes of carting to the\r\nwinepress, the Moslem religion being antagonistic to the grape's\r\nfermented juice.  Each district has its favoured kind, and in that of\r\nAlexandria and along the shore of the Mediterranean the vine is\r\nabundantly grown close to the ground, the soil being pure sand.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarity in the cultivation here, for V-shaped trenches\r\nare cut to a depth of from six to nine feet.  Then vine shoots are\r\nplanted in the bottom of the trench, where the young rootlets they put\r\nforth are within reach of water.  Vegetation is rapid, and the canes\r\ngradually cover the slopes on either side, while in two years the vines\r\nbegin to bear.\r\n\r\nThe bushes receive no irrigation from above, only depending upon the\r\nso-called winter rains, which are fairly frequent near the sea, and, as\r\nhas been shown, gaining their support from beneath the sand at the\r\nbottom of the trench.  But though no irrigation is brought to bear,\r\nthese ground vineries require annually an application of manure if the\r\nbest results are to be obtained.\r\n\r\nAs the land of the Delta is practically level, it affords scarcely any\r\nopportunities for the growth of the grape vine upon sunny slopes, this\r\nbeing the only instance in Egypt where grapes are grown with this\r\nexposure, while these slopes are all artificially made.\r\n\r\nAs regards insect pests, they may be almost classed as _nil_, and the\r\ngrower will not hear of thrip and scale, mealie bug, or red spider, so\r\nthat the cultivation is conducted under the most favourable conditions;\r\nbut the ubiquitous sparrow is even there, and, unless means are taken to\r\nscare away or destroy him, his ravages amongst the sweet berries are\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nHere, too, as may be supposed where grapes are produced to so great an\r\nextent, the thinning of the berries is not resorted to, and consequently\r\nthey are not so large as might be expected from the heat of the climate\r\nand the favourable conditions under which they are grown, nor is the\r\nflavour so fine as that of the beautiful bunches so carefully tended and\r\nwatched under glass in an English vinery; but they command a ready sale\r\nat about twopence per pound when the fruit is ripe, from the beginning\r\nof June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nThat delicious European fruit, the strawberry, by nature a dweller in\r\ncool and Alpine regions, was not known in Egypt till within forty years\r\nago.  Planted as an experiment by someone familiar with its qualities,\r\nit seems to have passed rather an unfavourable time in popular\r\nestimation; but it is now gradually gaining in favour, and the area\r\nunder cultivation is steadily extending.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is ripe in November, and finds a ready sale at tenpence per\r\npound; while, if the cultivation is good and well-managed, the return to\r\nthe planter may be reckoned at forty pounds for the produce of an acre.\r\n\r\nTo an Englishman familiar with the strawberry and its growth, one\r\nknowing the botanical character of the plant and the love of its roots\r\nfor a rich clay land, it seems surprising that it should flourish so\r\nwell in the sandy soil of Egypt.  But, of course, this is explained by\r\nthe yearly deposit of rich silt, or warp, the result of the annual\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the grower, he is not troubled as in England by woodland\r\nbirds, the Eastern crops suffering very little from their ravages, while\r\nthe plant enjoys almost an immunity from the attacks of insect plagues.\r\n\r\nIn the goodly list of luscious fruits we now come to figs--not the\r\novergrown, sickly fruit that only ripens under very favourable\r\ncircumstances in England, but the rich saccharine bag of embedded seed\r\nthat we know best in its dried and pressed form as the common fig.\r\n\r\nIts cultivation is spread over the whole Delta and the Fayoum, where its\r\nmilky, succulent stems and dark green leaves flourish thoroughly well.\r\nThe trees, as a rule, grow to a height of nine or ten feet, are well\r\nbranched, and find great favour with the native gardener, for they\r\npossess the admirable qualities of requiring not much attention, very\r\nlittle manure, and no pruning.  Joined to this, the trees are very\r\nprolific, and the luscious fruit finds great favour with the people.\r\n\r\nAnother popular fruit which grows without much attention save\r\nirrigating, and that to a very moderate degree, is the prickly pear.\r\n\r\nHere in England the melon is looked upon as a delicacy.  Gardeners vie\r\none with the other in its production, and seedsmen push forward this\r\nfashionable fruit by advertising their own special specimens of prize\r\nkinds, and these may be almost classed as legion.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the varieties are roughly divided into two, the sweet and the\r\nwater melon, and they both flourish wonderfully.  They are sown in\r\nFebruary and March, and thrive best in light loam, while their period of\r\ngrowth extends to about four months.\r\n\r\nIn their rapid development they attain to a goodly size.  For instance,\r\na water melon may reach the weight of thirty pounds, while from a\r\nmarketing point of view, taking large and small together, so as to\r\nstrike an average, the wholesale price may be placed at fivepence per\r\nmelon, and the cultivator of an acre of land devoted to this produce may\r\nreckon on receiving from forty to sixty pounds--pretty satisfactory for\r\nthe four months of growth and the land ready for planting with some\r\nother crop suitable to the season, for the grower has no dreary months\r\nof winter to intervene.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the sweet melon is similar to that of its relative,\r\nbut the fruit is finer in flavour and the plants not so prolific.\r\nConsequently the grower's receipts are much smaller, a fair computation\r\nof the returns from an acre being from about thirty to forty pounds.\r\nThere is another disadvantage, too, in the growth of this fruit.  It\r\nmust be consumed within some ten days after being fully ripe, whereas\r\nthe sturdy water melon will keep good for over a month.  In spite of the\r\ngood qualities of the melon, its ease of growth, and the market\r\nrequirements, nothing like sufficient are grown, the demand being\r\nsupplied by the importation of large quantities from neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThis popular fruit is always looked upon as deliciously refreshing and\r\nfine in flavour, but it may be mentioned here how much climate has to do\r\nwith the quality of the fruit.  Some years ago a friend, after a\r\nprolonged stay in Egypt, presented the writer with a few seeds of the\r\nEgyptian melon.  These were planted here in England and nursed up under\r\nglass with all the care that good gardening and watching could bestow.\r\nEverything was done to the exotic plants that a certain amount of\r\nexperience in growing melons could supply, and a couple of them\r\nflourished exceedingly--under glass, be it remembered, in a heated\r\nhouse--blossomed, and bore several fine large green fruit, whose\r\nincrease was watched and maturing waited for, but in vain.\r\n\r\nPresumably there was a certain amount of fragrance and ripening, for the\r\nfruit changed colour and gave forth the familiar odour; but the\r\nanticipations of enjoying a delicious Egyptian melon were not fulfilled.\r\nA good ripe vegetable marrow would have put either of them to the\r\nblush.\r\n\r\nPumpkins, big and gourd-like in growth--_pastiches_, as they are\r\ncommonly called--are most abundant in the early winter months, and are\r\nlargely brought down the river from Upper Egypt in barges or feluccas\r\nwith graceful lateen sails.  They form a pleasant addition to the food\r\nof the poor, while in their growth, favoured as they are by a hot sun,\r\nrich soil, and a sufficiency of moisture, their increase is almost\r\nfabulous, and anyone of curious taste and plenty of patience, aided by a\r\npowerful magnifying glass, might in all probability be gratified by\r\nseeing the creeping growth of the watery vine and the steady swelling\r\nout of its heavy earth-supported fruit.\r\n\r\nAnother fruit upon our list is the pomegranate, of late years made\r\nfamiliar upon the barrows in the London streets, and looking when cut\r\nopen something like an unwholesome blood orange that has aborted and\r\ntaken to growing an enormous excess of pips embedded in jelly within a\r\nhardened peel.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the enterprise which has brought the fruit here, it seems\r\nhardly likely to bring the shippers much reward; but it is extensively\r\ngrown in Egypt, is in great demand, and very profitable.\r\n\r\nTo continue with unfamiliar fruits, we may next name the great date\r\npalm, which may be looked upon as the most common tree to be found in\r\nEgypt, growing as it does all over both the upper and lower regions, as\r\nwell as on the sandy shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  No wonder that it\r\nis so largely planted, for its fruit is everywhere consumed by the\r\npeople as a portion of their food.\r\n\r\nThe tree begins to bear five years after planting, and should take the\r\nrecord as a profitable friend of man, for under favourable conditions it\r\nwill go on bearing for a hundred years or more, while a good tree will\r\nbear, on an average, over a hundredweight of fruit, which is disposed of\r\namongst the people at the popular price of one penny per pound.\r\n\r\nThe fruit ripens in September, and where the trees are selected, are of\r\nthe best variety and well attended to, the profits are very good,\r\nespecially if they are planted in a garden, where their tuft of leaves,\r\nraised high upon their tall, smooth stems, throws so little shade that\r\nthe ground beneath can be profitably planted with other crops, such as\r\nthe ordinary domestic vegetables of our own country, haricot beans,\r\npeas, spinach, etc.\r\n\r\n\"The large, dark, red-skinned, hard date,\" a friend writes from Cairo,\r\n\"has long been plentiful, and forms one of the staple foods of the\r\npopulace.  But to-day--_i.e._, mid-October--the soft, small luscious\r\ndate was served at table.  This is a most delicious fruit.  It tastes\r\nfor all the world like caramel toffee, though of course much softer.\r\nThese dates are wonderfully cheap.  They do not, however, keep more than\r\ntwelve hours after picking, and then begin to ferment and taste like\r\nbeer.  They are most plentiful, and there is, no doubt, much waste.  I\r\nshould think that a strong spirituous liquor could be distilled from\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nOther fruits may be mentioned, such as the quince, loquat, lotus, and\r\nthat favourite of farther east, the delicious mango; but these are not\r\nextensively cultivated, and may very well be excluded from a list of\r\nfruits that might be profitably grown for market purposes.  The wonder\r\nis that the mango has been neglected, comparatively, up to now.  Still,\r\nthe Egyptians are waking up to its value, for during 1903 there has been\r\nin Cairo a very plentiful supply of this luscious fruit, which bears\r\nsome semblance in the eating to a very rich and juicy apricot,\r\nresembling it also in colour.\r\n\r\nThe old saying of the Anglo-Indian who makes it a favourite, in spite of\r\na slight suspicion of turpentine in its flavour, is doubtless well-known\r\nto the reader--that which suggests that the best way of combating the\r\nsuperabundant juice and its gushing ways is to sit in one's bath when\r\npartaking of the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the prospects of fruit growing in Egypt, Mr Wright states\r\nthat he has no hesitation in saying that the conditions for gardening in\r\nEgypt are certainly far more favourable than in such an uncertain\r\nclimate as that of England, where in one night so much blossom may be\r\ndestroyed by frost; while in Egypt one never hears of such a thing as a\r\ntotal failure of crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTo take a stride now from the delicious and attractive to the homely and\r\nuseful, but at the same time more general and profitable growing crops\r\nof Egypt, let us turn to the gardener's mainstay--his vegetables.\r\n\r\nHere the first thing that strikes a visitor to this semi-tropical land\r\nis the familiarity of many of the garden crops--some, to use an\r\nold-fashioned term, grown out of knowledge; others perhaps wanting in\r\nthe qualities of the home country.\r\n\r\nMost familiar of all--certainly the most homely and extensively grown,\r\nwith great profit, is the cabbage, in three varieties--the White\r\nDrumhead, the Red Drumhead, and the Savoy.  Here a little unfamiliarity\r\nsteps in, and that is in the usage, for the cabbage in Egypt is utilised\r\nby the people as a salad as well as for cooking.\r\n\r\nFrom a gardener's point of view the head is not so large and hard, the\r\nvegetable not forming a solid heart as it does in England.  But this may\r\nbe accounted for by want of sufficient manure and attention--good\r\ngardening, in short--and perhaps the climate is not wholly to blame.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower flourishes fairly well under similar cultivation to the\r\ncabbage, but being more delicate requires greater attention; differing\r\nfrom the latter, the heads are well formed, but it is necessary to shade\r\nthem when coming to perfection, the clean, white growth being liable to\r\nbe damaged by the too ardent sun.\r\n\r\nGood cauliflowers command a ready sale at better prices than are to be\r\nhad in London as a rule, the average cost being from twopence-halfpenny\r\nto fivepence per head.\r\n\r\nAnother very familiar crop is seen largely in Egypt--the leek.  This is\r\na profitable vegetable, which grows to a good size, is easily\r\ncultivated, and realises a total per acre of about fifteen pounds.  The\r\ncarrot, too, is largely grown--in two varieties, the native and the\r\nGreek.  The native kind is sown in September, and is ready for lifting\r\nin January; while the Greek variety, sown in the same month, is also\r\nused for the production of a summer crop in February.  A deep soil is\r\nnecessary, while its sandy nature in Egypt is most suitable for this\r\nroot, and when carefully cultivated a fair return may be expected.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensively grown vegetables, a very general favourite\r\nalmost everywhere except in England, is the garlic.  It does well in\r\nEgypt, often in plots of as much as two acres, and has the advantages of\r\nnot requiring great care in cultivation, nor much water; while an\r\naverage crop will yield of the silvery bulbs enough to be valued at\r\nabout fifteen pounds per acre.\r\n\r\nThe onion, again, proves itself to be a most thriving inhabitant of this\r\nEastern country, growing hard, firm, clean-skinned, and healthy.  In\r\nthis sunny clime it is extensively grown, and not merely for home use.\r\nThe kind most popular is the red Spanish onion, and it is cultivated\r\nboth in Upper Egypt and Lower, there being this peculiarity of\r\ndifference, namely, that the Spanish onion grows to a larger size in the\r\nsouth, while the flavour of those grown in the Delta is superior.\r\n\r\nA few words will not be out of place respecting the cultivation of this\r\nvegetable in Upper Egypt, where it is grown most extensively as a farm\r\ncrop for export.  The seed is sown in the month of October,\r\ntransplantation takes place in March, and, all going well, the crop is\r\nready for lifting in June or July.  After the transplanting no\r\nirrigation is required.  The yield is approximately four to five tons\r\nper acre, and the market price two pounds per ton.\r\n\r\nThe next vegetable on our list when grown in quantity looks wonderfully\r\nfamiliar and home-like.  It is the artichoke--not that of tuberous and\r\nsunflower-like growth, but the deeply cut, acanthus-like leaved\r\nornamental plant of English gardens, with its majestic thistle-like\r\npurple head.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best-paying garden crops, these heads being greatly\r\nin demand by Europeans, though not much sought after by the natives.  In\r\nthe culture it will be found that the growth is excellent for four\r\nyears, when transplanting becomes necessary and should be resorted to.\r\n\r\nAsparagus is decidedly one of the best-paying crops in Egypt, and\r\nnaturally always in great demand by the Europeans who visit or pass\r\nthrough the country in ever-increasing numbers.  The cultivation is the\r\nsame good old-fashioned style practised in England, the beds being well\r\nprepared and generously treated with stimulants.  All that is required\r\nto secure a fine crop is proper attention under skilled direction, for\r\nthere are no drawbacks from frost, the grower never finding the sturdy\r\ngreenish purple shoots of yesterday drooping over and destroyed by the\r\nmorning's frost.\r\n\r\nWell treated, the beds will remain good for from ten to fifteen years, a\r\nvery modest computation this, for if well-managed and not cut too hard,\r\na good asparagus plantation ought to remain prosperous for twenty or\r\nthirty years.  As the result of his generous treatment in the way of\r\nstimulants, the grower may expect to receive wholesale from two\r\nshillings to five shillings per hundred shoots, according to their size.\r\n\r\nThat easily-cultivated wholesome vegetable, spinach, is largely grown\r\nfrom September till January; while now may be added, most extensively\r\nraised, a vegetable new to Occidental eyes, in company with three more\r\nwhich have long periods of growth, well fitting one to succeed the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe first is a small-flowered mallow, whose period is from September to\r\nOctober--it is much relished by the poorer Egyptians as a cooked\r\nvegetable resembling spinach; purslane is another very easily-grown\r\nplant, whose period is from March to September; Jews' mallow, too, is a\r\nvegetable greatly esteemed by the natives.  This is cultivated, and also\r\nfound growing wild in the fields.  It is much in demand as a summer\r\nvegetable.  Okra is another dish held in high estimation; it is not\r\ndifficult to grow, and forms a good paying crop.\r\n\r\nTo return to the familiar vegetables of Western gardens, we have a great\r\nfavourite in the shape of the haricot bean.  This grows exceedingly well\r\nin Egypt, on condition of its being well supplied with water, while the\r\nrapidity of its maturing is marvellous, showing, as it does, the beauty\r\nof the Egyptian climate and the power of the sun, for it is fit to pick\r\nthirty days after sowing, and the land ready for another crop, a fact\r\nwhich seems almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThe next on the list of profitable vegetables is the ordinary broad\r\nbean, but this is not extensively grown, as it is only consumed by the\r\nupper class natives, the poorer people preferring the ordinary horse\r\nbean, which is grown as a winter crop.  These beans are a very common\r\narticle of food, and are bought by the peasantry, ready boiled, in most\r\npublic places.  They are also largely employed as provender for the\r\nworking cattle.  The roots of an arum and of the lotus, too, are largely\r\nconsumed, and no wonder in the case of the latter in such a dreamy land;\r\nbut the effects are not quite the same as the former Laureate described.\r\n\r\nThe turnip, so popular in England, finds little favour, though it is\r\neasily raised as a medium-paying crop, and, odd as it may sound, it is\r\nprincipally used pickled.\r\n\r\nColocass is generally grown upon the farm.  The tubers are large, about\r\nthe size of an English turnip.  This is a splendid paying crop, which is\r\nlargely consumed as a vegetable and forms one of the staple foods of the\r\nfellaheen.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato is also a common vegetable here, but the name sounds\r\nforeign to an English cultivator.  It is a plant with tuberous roots of\r\na white colour, mostly eaten roasted, and, like the colocass, it is a\r\nfavourite food of the farm labourer.  The value of the produce of an\r\nacre may be estimated at ten pounds, and the duration of the crop is\r\nabout four months.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber thrives very well in Egypt, and, of course, there is no\r\nnecessity for the protection of glass.  It is as popular as in England,\r\nbut perhaps more utilised, lasting well through summer into autumn, and\r\nproves to be a very paying crop, provided it has a plentiful supply of\r\nwater.  This may also be said of the two varieties of vegetable marrow,\r\nthe green and white, which are largely raised.  The fruits are most\r\npopular when very young, and are much relished when treated as the\r\ncucumber is in England--that is to say, served as a salad, though it is\r\ncooked as well.  This, like the cucumber, is a medium-paying crop.  As\r\nfor the latter, it has been a favourite object of culture, dating right\r\nback to the days of the Israelites.  The allusion to the cucumber will\r\nbe recalled, and all species of this family are cultivated with\r\nassiduity.  Not that there is anything wonderful in this, for in a hot\r\ncountry fruits and vegetables of rapid growth, and which cause little\r\ntrouble, are sure to be affected.  We say rapid growth advisedly, for in\r\nfavourable seasons the shoot of a cucumber may be almost seen to grow,\r\nachieving as it does, at times, a length of twenty-four inches in a day\r\nand night.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary salads and herbs of the English garden are easily raised,\r\nand form profitable crops, available summer and winter, and are highly\r\nesteemed.  Among other plants we have poppies, madder, indigo, flax and\r\nhemp; while in the province of Fayoum one very charming form of\r\ngardening is practised, namely the growth of the rose tree, from which\r\nis prepared the rose water so popular all through the East.\r\n\r\nAs for flowers of all descriptions, where they are scarce it is the\r\nfault of the people, for many of our most brilliant kinds, especially\r\nthe more tender, which are raised in our islands only with care,\r\nbrighten the land and flourish everywhere like weeds.\r\n\r\nOur ornamental hothouse growth, the eggplant, here forms a most\r\nimportant vegetable, which is extensively cultivated.  It is similar to\r\nthe aubergine, which is used in France and seen occasionally in Covent\r\nGarden Market; but the years glide by, and its bids for popular favour\r\nhave met with but little success.\r\n\r\nIt is the reverse in Egypt, where its use is general, whether as a\r\ncooked vegetable, pickled, or in its raw state.  It demands a rich, deep\r\nsoil, and is raised in both varieties, white and black, for use in\r\nsummer and autumn, and proves to be very profitable to the grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most successful vegetable that has been introduced into\r\nEngland is the tomato.  Forty or fifty years ago a punnet or two of the\r\nattractive vivid scarlet fruit might be seen in season at Covent Garden\r\nMarket.  They were known as \"love-apples,\" and probably were bought and\r\nconsumed; but their growth into favour was very slow before becoming a\r\nfashion, and, with most people, an acquired taste.  The tomato forms a\r\nsummer production of the English market gardener, who is rivalled by the\r\ngrowers of the Channel Islands; and it is sent into market daily by the\r\nton; while, when the inclemency of our climate renders firing absolutely\r\nnecessary, the enterprising growers of the Canaries keep up the supply.\r\nFlourishing so well just off the west coast of Africa, it is only\r\nnatural that the tomato should find a congenial home in the fertile East\r\nof the great Continent, and it is extensively grown with increasing\r\nsuccess in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the tomato being treated as a profitable crop, here is\r\nan instance of what has been done in the way of market gardening in the\r\ndistrict of Alexandria, and may be done again by those persevering\r\ncultivators who are struggling to make a moderate living.\r\n\r\nA father and two grown-up sons may rent a plot of land of, say, four\r\nacres in extent, the rent of which perhaps reaches ten pounds per annum,\r\nthe gardener having to raise water for irrigation purposes.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the land would commence on the first of August.  The\r\nsoil may be classed as pure sand, which naturally requires a liberal\r\napplication of farmyard manure.  The ordinary tillage having been\r\ncarried out, the cultivator begins by transplanting seedling tomatoes\r\nabout the beginning of September.  Not being prepared to plant the whole\r\nof his four acres with tomatoes, he sows on another part vegetable\r\nmarrows, which in this hot climate are ready for plucking in six weeks,\r\nthe plants continuing to bear for a month; while directly this supply is\r\nfinished another crop of marrows may be sown on the same land.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the tomatoes are pushing forward to be ready by the first of\r\nJanuary at a time when the price is generally good, though probably in\r\nno other vegetable is there so great a variance in the amount it will\r\nfetch, dependent, of course, on the scarcity or plentifulness of the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nIt will be news, probably, for the British grower when he reads that the\r\nwholesale price of tomatoes in Egypt varies from one farthing to\r\nfivepence per pound.  Perhaps he may open his eyes a little wider when\r\nhe reads that a fair estimate of the gross return from growing tomatoes\r\nfor the market supply of Alexandria will vary from ten pounds to fifty\r\npounds or more per acre; and, of course, this is in the open ground,\r\nforming an almost immediate return, and with no preliminary outlay for\r\nglass houses.\r\n\r\nBut there are always drawbacks in gardening; and one of these, which may\r\noccasionally mar success, is caused on this land so near the sea by the\r\nfogs.  These, if they attack this delicate plant, so famous here at home\r\nfor developing aphides and fungoid diseases, like their unfortunate\r\nrelatives the potatoes, destroy the leaves, blacken them, hinder the\r\nsetting of the blossom, and generally reduce the crop.\r\n\r\nSeveral men have been known to engage in this cultivation in the\r\nneighbourhood of Alexandria during the last five years, and apparently\r\nthey have financially improved their position.\r\n\r\nLeaving the aristocratic tomato and turning to its poor relative the\r\npotato, it might have been hoped that in such a hot, sandy land as\r\nEgypt, where thousands of acres offer the same facilities, and are made\r\nas rich and fertile as the famous warp-land potato tracts of north\r\nLincolnshire and south Yorkshire, a home would have been found where it\r\nwould flourish free from disease.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the information to be given to the horticultural or\r\nagricultural grower upon this point is not good; in fact, quite\r\nsufficient to make the writer suggest that it should be a crop to be\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\nCertainly potato growing is tempting; the cultivation is simple, the\r\ncrops heavy and very profitable _if_--this is a very large \"if,\" and\r\nmeans so much, especially connected with weather and disease.\r\nExperience of long years employed in gardening and farming in Egypt\r\nsuggests that if the cultivation of the potato is entered upon it is\r\nbest to be grown on the farm or by large market gardeners.\r\n\r\nGood quality potatoes, such as are marketed in England, are rarely found\r\nin Egypt.  The crop is generally grown from \"seed\" imported from France\r\nand Italy, and a sandy soil is chosen.  Two crops, however, can be taken\r\nfrom the land per annum.  The first is planted in October, and should be\r\nready for lifting in the beginning of February, a period of five months;\r\nthe second, planted in February, is ready for harvesting in June--the\r\nduration of time for the crop to be on the land, one hundred and ten\r\ndays.  It sounds novel to a British grower to speak of a winter and a\r\nsummer crop of potatoes, two crops in the year; but this is so, and the\r\nwinter may yield three tons per acre, while the summer produces five to\r\nsix; while the current price per ton returned to the grower is about\r\nseven pounds.  As this is the most popular of vegetables, and the demand\r\nalways so great for good, well-grown new potatoes, experiments have been\r\ntried for raising these in the neighbourhood of Cairo and sending them\r\npacked in boxes to arrive in England, when they would be eagerly bought\r\nup in the market as luxuries, at the beginning of March.\r\n\r\nHere are the returns of the experiment.  From fifteen to eighteen pounds\r\nper ton were realised; carriage, freight, and other expenses amounted to\r\nthree pounds per ton, leaving a margin of profit over the price in Egypt\r\nof from five pounds to eight pounds sterling.  Enough this to make the\r\nDelta worthy the name of a land of promise, and especially more so when\r\nit can be, and is, announced that it is a country where there is no\r\npotato disease.  In exceptional cases, however, there is the drawback of\r\ncold weather, which retards the growth of the winter crop.\r\n\r\nAnother objection is that all the seed potatoes--and these are heavy of\r\nfreight--have to be imported, as storing throughout the summer is\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say, however, on behalf of our good old mealy friend,\r\nthe familiar object of every man's table, that in his guise of a\r\nforeigner--an African--he will be much better if he is let alone and not\r\nsubjected to the tricks of trade, which recoil upon and tend to spoil\r\nhis character.  For in the harvesting of the crop a bad practice has\r\narisen with the Egyptian market gardener, who generally carries on his\r\noperations in the neighbourhood of some irrigation canal connected with\r\nthe Nile, where he has, so to speak, abundance of conserved water always\r\non tap ready to give his fields a heavy watering.  This he bestows upon\r\nhis potatoes just before turning them out of the ground, as he finds\r\nthat it greatly increases the weight of the tubers; but it spoils their\r\nquality, and makes them what a Londoner calls \"waxy,\" and a north\r\ncountryman \"sad.\"\r\n\r\nOne ought not to close one's list of garden or farm productions without\r\nadding the names of a few so-called spices, or flavour-producing plants,\r\nwhich are always in steady demand and flourish well in the valley of the\r\nNile.  Among these are the capsicum, the green and the red, which are\r\nmost easy of culture, and come to maturity rapidly with the same\r\ntreatment as is accorded to the tomato.  There is also the lesser kind,\r\nor chilli; the caraway famous for its seeds, the coriander, and dill;\r\nwhile as to the familiar mustard, it hardly asks for cultivation at all,\r\nbut grows rapidly and ripens well, while the seed, when ground into the\r\nfamiliar condiment, is pungent and aromatic in the extreme.\r\n\r\nAs is well-known, a fine class of tobacco is grown pretty largely in the\r\nDelta.  It is wanting in the strength of the kinds raised in the West\r\nIndies and the United States.  It is excelled, too, in potency by the\r\nproducts of the East Indies; but it is of a very delicate flavour and\r\nmuch liked, though not so popular as that of Turkey in Europe and Asia.\r\nBut this is partially due to want of usage on the part of smokers, who\r\nare not accustomed to the pungency and fine aroma which appertain to the\r\nEgyptian tobacco as compared with the Turkish.  But the North African is\r\nremarkably good all the same, and flourishes splendidly, there always\r\nbeing abundance of sunshine at the picking time and excellent\r\nopportunity for _haying_ the crop.  For, after all said and done, a\r\ngreat deal of the aroma of tobacco depends upon the fermenting process\r\nit goes through in being dried and pressed, just as a well-made crop of\r\ngrass, hay, or clover, is dependent upon the skill of the farmer and his\r\nchoice of weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nSupposing an enterprising personage to have taken up a tract of the\r\ndesert of, say, one hundred acres in Egypt, where divisions must not be\r\nlooked for in the way of fence or hedge, but dependence placed upon the\r\nirrigating drain, it will be as well to give a list of the farm\r\nimplements he would require, and their cost--always presuming that he is\r\nprepared to be content, certainly at first, with the ordinary\r\ncontrivances of the country, which are rough, but very cheap.\r\n\r\nNecessaries are given here, and nothing more; while the accompanying\r\nillustrations spread through the text afford a very good idea of the\r\nobjects that will become familiar upon his pioneer land.\r\n\r\nFour native ploughs, exceedingly rough in construction, for tickling the\r\nsoil that is to laugh with a harvest, their cost about ten shillings\r\neach; a baulk wood, to be drawn by oxen, mules, or donkeys, over the\r\nyielding surface and act the part of a roller, six shillings; a ridging\r\nbox, for preparing the land for potatoes or sugar-cane, two shillings;\r\ntwo scrapers, eight shillings; chains, six shillings; one lorry, five\r\npounds; two box carts at four pounds each; two threshing norags at eight\r\npounds each; total, thirty-two pounds ten shillings.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is open to the man of enterprise to invest in the\r\ndifferent ingenious contrivances of the British agricultural implement\r\nmaker, such as the admirable invention the Patent Turn-Wrest Plough,\r\ninvented by Mr Thomas Wright, whose experience in the cultivation of\r\nthe Khedive's land resulted in his bringing to perfection an implement\r\nexactly suited to Egyptian needs.\r\n\r\nThe list given above names all that is absolutely necessary in a country\r\nwhere the tiller of the soil is so munificently aided by the almost\r\nincessant sunshine and abundant water.\r\n\r\nBut the farm implement _par excellence_ of the fellaheen, the tool which\r\nis to him what the shovel is to the British navvy, an instrument with\r\nwhich nearly everything in the way of moving the soil can be done, is\r\nthe fas, the broad-headed hoe seen carried by the two fellaheen\r\nlabourers in the engraving accompanying this chapter.  It is one of the\r\nfirst inventions of the cultivator, and not so very far removed from its\r\npierced flint representative occasionally turned up amongst the weapons\r\nand tools of primitive man; but when bronze, and later on iron, began to\r\nyield to the inventor, and the action of fire was utilised by the Tubal\r\nCains of their day, the broad-headed hoe began to develop; and we have\r\nit spread, in a very similar form to that still used in Egypt, all round\r\nthe world where men commenced to till the soil.  For we see it to this\r\nday very similar in shape in those two vast agricultural countries,\r\nIndia and China, while in Egypt it is handled by the fellaheen labourer\r\nin a way which is beyond praise.\r\n\r\nThe native plough, as seen by the photographic reproduction, is a very\r\nprimitive implement, the date of whose invention must be sought for by\r\nan examination of some of the characteristic gravings in marble to be\r\nfound in the Egyptian tombs, where the pursuits of the old-time\r\ninhabitants are recorded in a style that is absolutely wondrous.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a pole of wood measuring about ten feet in length, which\r\nis strongly bolted to the sole or body of the plough.  This soie, which\r\nmeasures three feet, is shod with a share resembling a pointed shovel.\r\nThe end of the pole is attached by a rope to the yoke, which lies across\r\nthe necks of the bullocks, buffaloes, or even camels--as seen in the\r\ncase of the Norag, drawn round and round over the threshing-floor--which\r\nare utilised by the Egyptian cultivator according to his means, while\r\nthe labourer guides the plough by the aid of an upright handle.  This\r\nimplement does not turn over the soil, and may be properly classed as a\r\none-tined cultivator.  There is a quaintness and old-world look, as\r\nshown in the photographs, in the mixture of forces, a huge buffalo bull\r\nbeing mated with a small native ox, a bullock with some fine-grown ass,\r\nwhile cows are frequently yoked together to help and drag the light\r\nplough.  Whether horses of the type of our heavy, slow-going farm breed\r\nwill finally work their way to the front remains to be seen; but at\r\npresent they have hardly begun to oust the old-world yokes of strangely\r\nassorted beasts from the turning up of the soil.  It is more probable,\r\nunless the fuel difficulty stands in the way, that the larger tracts\r\nwill be further brought into cultivation by means of steam and the deep\r\nsubsoil ploughs which do such an immensity of work in a single day.\r\n\r\nAs will be noted in the description, the modern native plough is single\r\nstilted, and it might be supposed in a country like this that such an\r\nimplement had been in use ever since the plough's invention; but as in\r\nmany other records that have been unearthed, engraven in stone in the\r\nwonderful pictorial writings found in temple and tomb, we have proof\r\nthat this was not always the case; for in the days of the agricultural\r\nKing Ti, who is supposed to date back to the Fifth Dynasty, that is some\r\nfive thousand years in the dim past, there is a representation of a\r\nplough in use with two handles, very much the same in shape as those\r\nbrought out quite lately and known as the \"American chilled,\" these\r\nbeing guided in our own old familiar way.\r\n\r\nThe Baulk wood used as a harrow or roller is drawn by two bullocks, and\r\nanswers its purpose in smoothing the very sandy soil fairly well.\r\n\r\nThe Ridging Box, or Baitana, is used for raising low ridges on the flat\r\nto retain the water for irrigation purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Scraper is a box with two handles for levelling high land and\r\nearning the sand to lower portions.\r\n\r\nThe Norag is a massive frame fitted with three or four axles, upon which\r\nare fixed steel discs twenty inches in diameter and with four or five\r\ndiscs alternately on each axle.  This is drawn by a pair of bullocks\r\nover the cut grain till it is threshed out.  This implement is, by long\r\nproof, most effectual in its action, for when drawn over the grain\r\nsheaves it acts in a two-fold way, loosening the ear, or, in the cases\r\nof some leguminous crops, the pods--and, of course, vastly helped by the\r\ntreading of the oxen's hoofs--so that the grain falls through right to\r\nthe bottom and is covered by fresh quantities, sheaves, or the like, of\r\nthe crop that is being threshed.  Its second action is that the edges of\r\nthe discs are constantly bruising and half cutting the straw or stalks,\r\nwhich in a dry season or from want of effective irrigation are often\r\nhard and woody.  It must be understood that the straw is not used; as in\r\nEngland, for litter, but as the most important food for cattle, and this\r\naction of the Norag, with its sharp discs, so bruises and chops up the\r\nstraw that it becomes softened in its harshness, and far better for the\r\nanimals to which it is supplied for food.  In fact, during the time when\r\nit is most supplied to the cattle, which is during the summer or least\r\nabundant season, it is a work of necessity to make it more attractive to\r\nthe animals, this bruising and cutting bringing forth the flavour of\r\nsuch juices as still remain in the plant, making it slightly aromatic\r\nand certainly more palatable as food.\r\n\r\nWe in England have not been ignorant of the value in cattle feeding of\r\nendeavouring to give some zest to the coarser kinds of fodder which\r\neconomy necessitates in the case of the British farmer.  Poor hay, musty\r\ngrain, consequent upon a bad harvest, and unsatisfying chaff, are eaten\r\nby unfortunate cattle, which, suffering as it were from Hobson's choice\r\nof having that or none, eat the provender supplied without protest; but\r\nNature resents it for them, and they show it in their poor condition.\r\nOf course, in the case of a well-bred horse the matter is different; he\r\nsnuffs at and blows upon the untempting contents of his manger, and then\r\nturns away in disgust from that which his cloven-hoofed companions\r\npatiently chew.\r\n\r\nBut in many a case this damaged grain, hay, or straw has been made\r\nattractive by a sprinkle of one of the savoury cattle foods that were\r\ninvented and imitated some forty or fifty years ago, a portion of the\r\ningredients in one kind consisting of the broken up and stickily sweet\r\nlocust bean and the contents of its pod, with a dash of the bitter and\r\naromatic fenugreek.  But in Egypt, where the rain does so little towards\r\ninjuring the straw or stalk, such musty fare seldom falls to the lot of\r\nthe native cattle, while this chopped or bruised straw, the _tibn_\r\nalready mentioned, is constantly prepared at the time of threshing by\r\nthe action of the ingeniously constructed Norag.\r\n\r\nNo one can see the spot laid down for the reception of the harvest\r\nproduce in Egypt--so much hard-beaten earth upon which the peas, beans,\r\nor grain of various sorts are thrown, ready for the oxen to drag over it\r\nthis peculiar revolving wheeled or disked implement--without being\r\nreminded of the place where the plague was stayed--the threshing-floor\r\nof Araunah the Jebusite; nor can he help comparing the native plough,\r\nthat simple scarifier, with antique agricultural tillers of the soil\r\ndepicted on the most ancient sculpture or penned in olden manuscripts,\r\nas in use by ancient nations as well as by our Saxon ancestors.  The\r\nploughs of the West many, many centuries back are almost precisely the\r\nsame as those we see in the Egypt of to-day, save in the cases where he\r\nwho drives the plough has to deal with a hard and heavy earth crust far\r\ndifferent to the light and sandy soil of Egypt, whose labourer guides a\r\nplough with one hand; for in one antique representation of ploughing the\r\nlabourer steers the agricultural implement with his left and wields in\r\nhis right a heavy axe, whose purpose is to break the clods prior to the\r\npassing of the implement he steers.\r\n\r\nIngeniously constructed, but that is all that can be said of the native\r\nthreshing machine, for amongst the poorer class cultivators its\r\nmanufacture is almost inconceivably rough, and clumsy in the extreme.\r\nNo verbal description could compete with that afforded by the\r\nphoto-engraving that accompanies these pages, depicting, as it does, the\r\nrough, effective implement, its attendants with their quaint forks and\r\nrakes, and, above all, the driver, who adds his weight to the farming\r\nimplement and shoulders his very merciful speed-inducing wand for the\r\nbenefit of his mixed yoke.  This is, of course, an awkward team, but not\r\ninfrequent; and the Egyptian farmer who first attempted this application\r\nof force must have been as eccentric as he was ingenious when he coupled\r\non either side of such a rough pole a patient camel and a native bull.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, and by a careful division of labour and adjustment of the\r\nyoke, the two patient beasts may be seen plodding on round and round the\r\nsmooth, level, modern representative of the old Biblical\r\nthreshing-floor.  The more regular yoke attached to the Norag, which\r\nfrom its cutting and bruising qualities has been translated by the\r\nFrench \"Hache paille,\" or chop-straw--this bears astounding similarity\r\nto the \"whop-straw\" shared by the old-fashioned British bucolic with his\r\nflail--is seen in the other photograph of the pair of native cows,\r\nthough very frequently it is drawn by a yoke of oxen, by the big, clumsy\r\nbuffaloes, or even by a yoke consisting of one of each, the oxen taking\r\nthe palm for their sturdiness and staying power.  This mode of threshing\r\nand bruising and chopping the straw is carried out in a similar mode in\r\nparts of India.\r\n\r\nHere though these old ways are giving place to the use of modern\r\nmachinery, which is readily adopted by the Egyptian, who naturally does\r\nnot find in the threshing machine the old failing complained of by the\r\nBritish farmer, to wit, that it bruised and broke up the straw,\r\nrendering it unfit to use as thatching or to make into the neat, pale\r\ngolden trusses once so familiar in the market.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an unpleasant feature in the native threshing in\r\nconnection with the samples of corn.  As may be supposed, when the\r\nthreshing is at an end and the _tibn_ stacked, or rather piled in a\r\nheap, leaving the grain to be shovelled up, no amount of winnowing and\r\nsifting can remove from it a certain amount of sullying brought about by\r\nthe constant trampling of the oxen.\r\n\r\nThis has, in the past, acted inimically to the success of the fine,\r\nhard, dry, shot-like grain of Egypt in foreign markets; but in these\r\ndays of advance not only has the bullock-worked European threshing\r\nmachine made its way into the Egyptian fields, but it is no uncommon\r\nthing for the pleasant hum of the steam thresher to be heard where the\r\ningenious machinery of England is carrying on its untiring labour of\r\nthreshing out, winnowing, and filling its sacks of grain, as much at\r\nhome as if it were upon some Yorkshire or Lincolnshire farm.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place, after dealing with the Egyptian _tibn_, to\r\nstate here that experienced cultivators have found the advantage of\r\ncarefully feeding their working bullocks so as to obtain for them the\r\ngood, sound stamina which will be naturally followed by the best amount\r\nof work.  This they find by sprinkling amongst the chopped straw or\r\n_tibn_ supplied about one-third in weight of beans, not crushed or\r\nground, but either whole or split; for it has been noticed that the\r\ndraught animals flourish better upon this food than upon bean meal;\r\nwhile the process of splitting, Mr Wallace states, saves the bean from\r\nthe attack of one of the Egyptian farmer's minor plagues--the weevil;\r\nfor, as if governed by some wondrous instinct in their preparations for\r\nthe continuation of their species, and a desire to ensure for them good\r\nwholesome food upon which to feed, these creatures do not lay their eggs\r\nin damaged grain.\r\n\r\nOf late years many of the European implements have been introduced--\r\nRansomes' threshers and straw--bruisers, one-way or balance ploughs,\r\nharrows, clod-crushers, horse-hoes, Norwegian harrows, spring-tooth\r\ncultivators, steam ploughs and cultivators, mowers, reapers, and\r\nbinders, maize-shellers, seed graders, broadcast-sowing machines, and\r\nseed drills.\r\n\r\nEuropean ploughs, as they invert the earth, are naturally the most\r\nbeneficial to the growth of the crop, as by bringing the under-soil to\r\nthe surface to receive benefit from the sun and air, they greatly\r\nimprove the root range of the plants.\r\n\r\nSteam ploughing is gradually gaining in favour, owing to the scarcity of\r\nwork-bullocks.  A few of the large proprietors have recently purchased\r\nplants or entire gear.  The scythe for cutting clover has been found,\r\ntoo, a great improvement upon the antique native fashion of pulling by\r\nhand, the saving of expense being seventy per cent.  But a great\r\ndrawback to the adoption of European implements is the aversion of the\r\nEgyptian farm labourer to any innovation, his want of intelligence in\r\nhandling what to him appears complicated machinery, and his\r\nunwillingness to learn.  Here, though, in common justice it must be said\r\nthat he does not stand alone, for the experiences of the British farmer\r\nin most of our counties, and his battles with the pig-headed\r\nconservatism of his men, would form an amusing chronicle.  The clumsy\r\nimplement of his forefathers, invented, historians say, some five\r\nthousand years ago, is in the native's eyes perfectly right, and could\r\nnot be better; and he prefers to go on blistering or hardening his hands\r\nin what he looks upon as the good old ways, until he is forced to handle\r\nmodern machines, and then by very, very slow degrees he begins to see,\r\nbut not before he has broken many, or put them out of gear.  But\r\nunfortunately the farm labourer is not the sole offender, as the history\r\nof the introduction of mechanism of any kind will tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about Egypt and its soil; but in giving here an\r\naccount of its possibilities and prospects for cultivation in the ways\r\nof modern farming, some repetition is necessary.  It is fair to say that\r\nthe soil of Egypt is one of the richest in the world.  It is alluvial,\r\nranging from the heavy argillaceous to light loam.  It varies, too, in\r\nits fertility, and in low-lying lands is frequently impregnated with\r\nsalt.  This is generally owing to want of drainage.  When properly\r\ntreated and flooded with water it soon becomes what is technically known\r\nas \"sweet,\" and available for the growth of crops.\r\n\r\nVery rich soils are to be found in the provinces of Menoufieh and\r\nCharkieh, while those of Beherah are flat and generally low-lying; but\r\nthe depth may range up to forty feet!\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the land for the various crops is not what may be\r\ntermed difficult, although in the heavy black lands powerful draught\r\noxen are required for the ploughs and other implements.  But with\r\nirrigation at command, and abundance of moisture becoming more and more\r\ncommon in connection with the modern dams and canals, if the land be\r\nhard and baked it can be flooded with water as required, when it quickly\r\nbecomes in a friable condition, and hence comparatively easy to break\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn the Delta such conditions are never experienced as frequently are\r\nencountered upon the heavy clays in England, where the land becomes so\r\nhard that it cannot be tilled.\r\n\r\nPossessing the qualities of richness, vast depth of soil, and a glorious\r\nclimate, it is not surprising that with the steady developments of the\r\nKhedive's country and the safety and security enjoyed under his\r\nenlightened rule, accompanied by the example he is setting in his\r\nexperiments for the advancement of Egyptian agriculture, the price of\r\nland has risen enormously.  Within the last few years one hundred pounds\r\nper acre is quite a common figure; but that which is unreclaimed can\r\nstill be purchased for from fifteen to thirty pounds.  This, of course,\r\nnecessitates an additional outlay, which is, after all, quite a moderate\r\nsum, upon improvements, when it will yield a good return of profit.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian agriculturist divides _his_ year into _three_ portions:\r\n\r\nSummer, from April 1st to August 1st.\r\n\r\nNileh, from August 1st to December 1st.\r\n\r\nWinter, from December 1st to April 1st.  But it must be remembered that\r\nthe Egyptian winter would be better named balmy spring.\r\n\r\nAs this little work is written primarily for those who take an interest\r\nin the progress of a favoured country, and who may possibly be looking\r\ntowards the East with the eyes of investment, or for a future home where\r\nthey may lead a Virgilian or bucolic life, it is proposed to give here a\r\nsimple, business-like account of the various processes and preparations\r\nmade for the growth and harvesting of the different crops sown in the\r\nabove seasons:--\r\n\r\nWinter Crops: Clover, barley, beans, and wheat.\r\n\r\nSummer Crops: Cotton and sugar-cane, and also maize.\r\n\r\nNileh Crop: Maize alone.\r\n\r\nRotation.--A three years' rotation is the one generally practised,\r\nalthough there is a tendency to limit it to two years.\r\n\r\nIt would be as well to consider the crops as they succeed each other,\r\nbeginning with the cotton.\r\n\r\nA great deal of interest attaches to the growth of cotton in Egypt.  It\r\nwas largely cultivated by the ancient Egyptians, and its products\r\nutilised, but after a time--it is impossible to say how long, possibly\r\nduring the great changes that took place during incursions, conquests,\r\nor change of rulers--its growth died out to such an extent that a few\r\ngenerations back, as an article of utility, its cultivation had pretty\r\nwell ceased, and cotton was scarcely known, save as a decorative shrub\r\nin the gardens of Cairo.\r\n\r\nBut during the reign of the Khedive's ancestor, Mehemet Ali, a man of\r\ngreat foresight, full of determination for the advance of his people, he\r\ncompletely grasped the idea that Egypt was one of the most suitable of\r\ncountries for the cultivation of the cotton tree, and that it ought to\r\nbe produced in his dominions instead of dependence being placed upon\r\nimportation from other lands.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this idea, he began to make experiments, testing it, so\r\nto speak, by forming plantations.  These turned out so well that he\r\nproceeded to take further steps, and with great enterprise commenced the\r\ncultivation upon a large scale.  Many thousands of the Egyptian acres\r\nwere planted in the lower provinces, and to a far greater extent\r\nplanting was carried on in the rich lands of Upper Egypt bordering on\r\nthe Nile.\r\n\r\nThe little trees responded freely to the Egyptian cultivation; the rich,\r\nirrigated soil, yearly replenished by the sediment left by the floods,\r\nproved that the ancients were right, and wherever the land was deep the\r\nresults were most favourable; while where a bad selection had been made,\r\nand the soil was shallow and inferior, the return of the pods, or\r\ntechnically _bolls_, was poor.\r\n\r\nThe method of its cultivation will be given _in extenso_ farther on, but\r\nit will be as well to note here, in regard to the enterprise which\r\nturned Egypt into its present state as one of the great cotton-growing\r\ncountries of the world, that the seed was originally imported from\r\nBrazil, though it is undoubtedly a native of Northern Africa; and at the\r\npresent time the returns are very great.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the land for the growth of cotton commences in\r\nJanuary.  The seed is sown from the middle of February till the middle\r\nof March, and the cropping harvested, or picked, about the end of\r\nNovember; while previous to the last picking of the soft woolly pods,\r\nclover seed is sown amongst the standing cotton trees.\r\n\r\nThis, so to speak, stolen crop provides a supply for horses, cattle, and\r\nsheep till the end of June; for it must be borne in mind that Egypt is\r\nnot a land of fields and meadows enclosed by hedgerows; hence grazing\r\nfor cattle is the result of foresight, and has to be provided as\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nOn the land not sown with clover, and at the end of the cotton harvest,\r\nafter the little trees have been uprooted, a crop of beans is sown,\r\nwhich becomes ready for harvesting in April; and now there is a period\r\nin which the agriculturist may take his choice of sowing what may be\r\ntermed catch crops, or fallowing his land for five months.  In this he\r\nis guided by position and the facility offered for the disposal of such\r\neasy crops as water melons or maize, which can be taken after beans.\r\n\r\nIt is at the end of October that he begins to think of his main crops,\r\nwhen wheat and barley are sown, to be harvested from the beginning of\r\nMay to the end of June.  Then follows the main crop of maize, which\r\noccupies the land from July 15th to November 15th.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the harvesting of this main crop of maize, clover is again\r\nsown, and from this one or two pasturings are obtained before the land\r\nis broken up once more for the succeeding important crop of cotton, this\r\ncompleting the rotation.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane has not been given a place in this rotation, as it is\r\nprincipally grown in Upper Egypt for the manufacture of sugar, while we\r\nare dealing with the rich lands of the Delta and the farming there.  But\r\nwe may here remark that the Egyptians are as fond of the green\r\nsugar-cane as an article of diet as the blacks of the West Indies, who\r\nmay be seen munching its luscious saccharine at all times and seasons.\r\n\r\nThere is something more in this among the Egyptians than the\r\ngratification of a sweet palate, for it is eaten largely from the great\r\nfaith of rich and poor alike in its tonic qualities.  \"Gasab,\" or as\r\nthey pronounce it in Cairo \"'asab,\" is considered to be one of the\r\ngreatest restorers for those who from weak health or excess are what we\r\ncall in modern phraseology \"run down\"--perhaps as pleasant, plentiful,\r\nand economical a medicament as could be used.  It is a common sight for\r\nthe European to see the poor, patient, overladen, and underfed donkeys\r\ncoming into Cairo every morning heavily laden with the juicy caries that\r\nhave been grown in the neighbouring fields.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed in the above rotation that a crop of clover precedes\r\nand succeeds the cotton.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to a technical statement of the treatment of an Egyptian\r\nfarm; not merely a description of farming in Egypt, but of the\r\nmanagement of a farm based upon the careful observations of one who has\r\npassed many years in the Delta and has made the cultivation and cropping\r\nof its peculiar soil a thorough life study.  In fact, the tracts of land\r\nunder his superintendence offer themselves as specimens worthy of\r\ncopying by all who seek to make the land of Egypt profitable and well\r\npaying in return for the capital, large or small, that may be invested\r\nthere.  This being said, we at once plunge again _in medias res_, and,\r\nat the risk of being too formal and technical, recapitulate the crops in\r\ntheir order.  Cotton.\r\n\r\nFollowed by Clover, or Beans, or both.\r\n\r\nFollowed by Fallow, or catch crops of Maize or Water Melons.\r\n\r\nWheat and Barley.\r\n\r\nFollowed by three months' fallow, or Maize, main crop, and catch crop of\r\nSesame.  Clover--\"Fachl\" on land after Maize and Clover \"Miscowy\" after\r\nFallow.  Then Cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nWe will take an estate of three hundred acres, and on inspection, say in\r\nthe month of March, the crops occupying the land under the following\r\nrotation will be as under:--\r\n\r\nThree Years' Rotation.  March.\r\n\r\n  100 Acres Cotton\r\n  50 acres Clover\r\n  50 acres Beans\r\n  80 acres Wheat\r\n  20 acres Barley\r\n\r\nTwo Years' Rotation.  March.\r\n\r\n  150 Acres Cotton\r\n  30 acres Clover\r\n  40 acres Beans\r\n  60 acres Wheat\r\n  20 acres Barley\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years there has been a tendency to increase the\r\ncotton crop and adopt the two years' rotation; but it is not a good\r\npractice, as it tends to exhaustion of the soil, especially where there\r\nis a want of farmyard manure.  The cereal crops also suffer from the\r\nconsequent lateness of sowing.\r\n\r\nTwo crops off the same land per annum: Wheat, sown November 15th,\r\nharvested May 30th; maize, sown July 15th and harvested November 15th.\r\nOr clover, sown November 1st, first crop January 1st, 3 pounds; second\r\ncrop March 15th, 3 pounds.  Sow cotton in end of March.  Ground clear,\r\nNovember.  Probable gross return per acre, 24 pounds.\r\n\r\nWe might multiply instances where two separate crops can be grown on the\r\nsame land in twelve months, such as maize followed by potatoes, etc.;\r\nbut it may be safely stated that a very small area of a well-appointed\r\nfarm is allowed to lie fallow, the land being continually under some\r\ncrop or another.\r\n\r\nA few remarks on the before-mentioned crops as to cultivation:--\r\n\r\nCotton is the principal crop in the rotation, and gives far the best\r\nmonetary return, while at the present time reports from the Egyptian\r\nSoudan are beginning to speak very highly of the alluvial tracts between\r\nthe White and Blue Niles as being more favourable to the growth of\r\ncotton than the lower portions of the Nile Valley, while affording ten\r\ntimes the area for the planting of this important staple that can be had\r\nin the lower portions of the Delta.  In fact, matters seem to prove that\r\nUpper Egypt is going to develop into the finest cotton-growing country\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe preparation commences in January, and generally three ploughings are\r\nrequired to bring the land into a proper tilth.  The more thorough the\r\ncultivation the better for the crop.  The land is then thrown into\r\nridges measuring from crest to crest three feet.  Then a pair of ridges\r\nis drawn across the longitudinal ridges, the distance between each pair\r\nof ridges (which form a waterway) being twenty-two yards.  Between these\r\npairs--_i.e._ eleven yards distance from each--a single ridge is made.\r\nThis acts as a partition to stop the water.  Six ridges are irrigated by\r\nallowing the water to flow from these cross-waterways, and the reason\r\nfor confining the length of the ridges to eleven yards is to ensure the\r\nevenness of the irrigation as to height of water level, as the ground\r\nmay have slight fall, and if the whole length of the ridges were to be\r\nwatered at once the water would rise too high at the lower parts before\r\nthe higher levels were properly soaked.\r\n\r\nThe sowing commences February 15th.  Boys and girls drop the seed in\r\nclusters of, say, twelve seeds in set-holes made by a pointed stick on\r\none side of the ridge, two-thirds from the bottom of the furrow, and at\r\na distance of sixteen inches between each set-hole.\r\n\r\nAfter \"planting,\" the ridges are watered, care being taken not to allow\r\nthe water to rise to the level of the seed.  Sufficient moisture for\r\ngermination is derived from capillarity.  The seeds shoot and the plants\r\nappear above ground in from ten to twelve days.  Twenty-five days\r\nelapse, and then a light hand-hoeing is given, while after fifteen days\r\nmore the plants are thinned, two or three being allowed to remain in\r\neach set-hole.\r\n\r\nImmediately after thinning the young plants receive their first\r\nwatering.  After, say, twelve days a second hand-hoeing is given, and\r\nagain after twelve days a third.  Then comes the second watering, by\r\nmeans of trench and canal.  After an interval of ten days another\r\nhand-hoeing is given, and this finishes the task, as the cotton trees\r\nhave attained a height which precludes the possibility of using the\r\nimplement.\r\n\r\nAt intervals of from ten to fifteen days six waterings are given.  This\r\nbrings the grower to the time--about September 10th--when the crop is\r\nready for the first picking.  Women, boys, and girls pluck the cotton\r\nfrom the trees.  Eight to twelve of the workers may pick an acre per\r\nday, and they receive as payment one shilling per 100 pounds.  At the\r\nconclusion of the picking the field is irrigated again, and after\r\ntwenty-five days the second crop is dealt with.  Another irrigation\r\nfollows, time is given for development, and then comes the third and\r\nlast picking.\r\n\r\nThe cotton trees are next cut close to the ground or pulled up by the\r\nroots, and are utilised as fuel.\r\n\r\nAn average crop on good land may produce 1,890 pounds of raw cotton,\r\nwhich on being ginned will yield 600 pounds of fibre.  The raw\r\ncotton--_i.e._ in seed--is sold per 375 pounds at, say, 3 pounds.  This\r\nwill gin out, say, 105 pounds fibre and 205 pounds seed; so that the\r\ntotal worth of the crop may be estimated at 18 pounds, exclusive of the\r\nvalue of the wood, which may be placed at 4 shillings per acre.  These\r\nfigures are often exceeded where the cultivation is well attended to.\r\n\r\nCost of raising one acre of cotton in Egypt.\r\n\r\n+===============================+=============+\r\nY                               Ypounds s. d.

Among these are the cotton caterpillar and the boll-worm,\r\nthe former being propagated from eggs deposited by a moth, which do\r\ngreat damage if allowed to hatch, by the larva feeding upon the plant.\r\nIf the leaves upon which the eggs are deposited are pulled and burned,\r\nthis mitigates the destruction so far as it is successfully carried out.\r\nThe boll-worm bores into and feeds upon the heart of the young bolls,\r\nand thereby totally destroys them for the production of fibre.  Up to\r\nthe present no remedy has been found to prevent the ravages of these\r\npests.  The damage may amount to 20 per cent.  Fogs and dews in the\r\nmonth of October also cause injury to the bolls.\r\n\r\n*Beans after Cotton*.--This crop may be sown at any time during the\r\nmonth of November, the earlier the better.  The beans may be either sown\r\nbroadcast or dropped into the furrow, behind the native plough.  The\r\nquantity of seed required is two and a half bushels.  The land must be\r\nvery moist, or an irregular germination of the seed will be the result.\r\nThe crop receives the first watering thirty days after sowing, or\r\nimmediately before flowering, and again when the beans have formed in\r\nthe pod.  Harvest will commence about the middle of April.  Men, women,\r\nand boys pull the crop by hand, breaking the stalks close to the ground,\r\nsometimes uprooting them, but a small serrated hook is also used to cut\r\nthe stalks.  Six hands will reap one acre per day, and the payment is in\r\nkind, at the rate of one sheaf per thirty.  The crop is then carted to\r\nthe threshing-floor, spread out to dry, and threshed by the Norag; or,\r\nas modern implements are creeping into use, by a steam threshing machine\r\nmade by one of the famous English firms.\r\n\r\nThis crop does not receive any manure, but requires a rich, heavy soil,\r\nwhen under favourable conditions a yield may be expected of from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-five bushels per acre--price per five bushels, 1\r\npound.  Occasionally this crop is damaged by hot blasts--\"Khamsin\r\nwinds\"--which shrivel the bean, especially if they occur when it is\r\nsoft.  We have also the pest of broomrape; and if badly infested by this\r\nweed, great destruction follows to the crop.  Beans are the main feed of\r\nworking bullocks, milch cows, and donkeys.\r\n\r\nCatch crops, on land after beans.\r\n\r\n*Maize (summer)*.--Sown end of April, ready to be pulled after sixty\r\ndays.  This crop is consumed by the natives, who roast the cobs.  Cost\r\nof raising one acre, 2 pounds 10 shillings, exclusive of rent.  Gross\r\nvalue of crop may be approximately 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n*Water Melons*.--Sown at the same date, ripe after eighty days.  Cost of\r\nraising, 3 pounds 10 shillings.  Probable value of the produce of an\r\nacre, 12 pounds.  After these crops have been harvested the land is\r\nfallowed for three months.  During the fallow it receives two or three\r\nploughings, and is flooded with water to prepare it for sowing the\r\ncereal crops.\r\n\r\n*Egyptian Clover (_Trifolium Alexandrinum_)*.--After Cotton.--This crop\r\nmay be termed the preserver of Egyptian agriculture, since, as\r\npreviously alluded to, it provides pasturage for horses, cattle, sheep,\r\ncamels, mules, and donkeys, for a period of seven months, and also\r\ntaking into account its beneficial effects on the soil, restoring\r\nfertility by root residue containing nitrogen.  Sown in the end of\r\nOctober amongst the standing cotton trees, the seed falls upon the newly\r\nirrigated soil and takes root, no covering being required.  Sixty pounds\r\nof seed is sufficient for an acre.  The first crop should be ready for\r\npasturing at the beginning of January; second crop, seventy-five days;\r\nthird crop, forty days; fourth crop, thirty-five days' interval.\r\n\r\nThis variety is named \"Miscowy,\" and stands copious watering.  The first\r\nand second crops contain about eighty per cent, of moisture.  The third\r\ncrop may be made into hay, and the fourth crop--part only--may be\r\nthreshed to furnish seed.  The gross weight of the four crops, cut\r\ngreen, may be estimated at thirty tons, or five tons of hay.  The\r\nwork-bullocks, cows, buffaloes, horses, etc., are tethered by a rope\r\nattached to their fore-legs and fixed to a peg driven into the ground,\r\nthe cattlemen moving the animals forward as required.  The cattle lie\r\nout at night while pasturing on the clover.\r\n\r\nIf the crop of clover is near a large town where dairymen require green\r\npasture, the price per feddan, to be consumed on the land, may be put at\r\n4 pounds, 3 pounds, 3 pounds 10 shillings, 3 pounds 10 shillings for the\r\nfour crops, or a total of 14 pounds.  Growers are sometimes troubled by\r\nattacks of cut-worms, which ravage the young shoots of clover; but\r\nflooding with water often destroys the pest.  There is also the\r\nparasitic weed Dodder (_Cuscuta Trifolii_), which occasionally does\r\ndamage to the crop.  The cost of five bushels of clover seed varies from\r\none pound 10 shillings to 3 pounds 10 shillings, according to supply and\r\ndemand.  The variety \"Fachl\" clover occupies a separate place in the\r\nrotation, and will be treated later.\r\n\r\n*Wheat*.--Varieties: Common wheat, Bocchi, and Indian.  The Bocchi, a\r\nwhite wheat, is extensively grown.  The third, a reddish wheat, has\r\nrecently been introduced from India, and gives good crops.  Egyptian\r\nwheats are hard, but are deficient in albuminoids.  Unfortunately, care\r\nis not taken in selecting the seed, and many samples are badly mixed\r\nwith red and white varieties.  The crop is sown on fallow land after\r\nclover and beans.  The land, previous to sowing the seed, has received a\r\nwatering.  Fifteen to twenty days after, the seed--two and a half\r\nbushels--is sown broadcast, and is ploughed in by the native plough.\r\nThe sowing is very often imperfectly performed, the distribution of the\r\nseed being very irregular.  The next process is rolling by drawing a\r\nbaulk of wood (see illustration), three yards long, over the land; then\r\nridges are made seven yards apart to regulate the even distribution of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about twelve days after the sowing the shoots appear above\r\nground, when the \"braird\" is about four inches high.  Occasionally there\r\nis an attack of \"grub,\" or cut-worm; but the damage is never serious, a\r\nwatering destroying the pest, and some seed sown on the blanks caused by\r\nthe worm soon make good the damage.  Rolling with a press roller has\r\nbeen found to materially stop the destruction.  Eighty days after\r\nsowing, or when the crop has attained a height of two feet, it receives\r\nits first watering; forty days afterwards its second and last.  Sixty\r\ndays after the final irrigation the crop will be ripe for harvest.  The\r\nmethod of harvesting--reaping--is by small hand hooks, men, women, and\r\nboys turning out to work at midnight, reaping till seven a.m.,\r\nsubsequently gathering the unbound sheaves into rows, and afterwards\r\ngleaning, finishing up about nine a.m.\r\n\r\nThe foremen then distribute to the reapers one sheaf for thirty-five, as\r\npayment in kind.  The reason for reaping the crop by night is that, if\r\nperformed in the daytime, while the heat is great, the grain would shed,\r\nthe dews at night preventing this loss.  Reaping by self-binders has\r\nbeen tried, but the shedding of grain was excessive, as they could only\r\nbe worked in the daytime; while the farm labourer was not qualified to\r\nwork such a complicated machine.  Labour is so cheap that it is not\r\nnecessary to resort to labour-saving machinery.  The sheaves (unbound)\r\nare transported from the fields to the threshing-floor by camels, carts\r\ndrawn by oxen, or mules.  The sheaves are then placed in a circle\r\nmeasuring twenty yards in diameter.  Four, five, or more pairs of oxen,\r\neach pair attached to a Norag, circle round on the top of the grain, and\r\nwhen it has been threshed out and the straw cut and bruised by the\r\nrevolving discs and the feet of the oxen, it is thrown into a heap in\r\nthe centre.  Fresh sheaves are added to the circle as they arrive.  When\r\nall the grain has been threshed the next process is the winnowing by\r\nthrowing the cut straw and grain into the air vertically by means of a\r\nfive-pronged wooden fork.  The cut straw, _Tibn_, is carried by the wind\r\nto a distance, while the grain falls near to the operator.\r\n\r\nThe payment to the winnower is at the rate of fourpence per five\r\nbushels.  Threshing and finishing machines, made in England, similar to\r\nthe one illustrated, are used on all the large estates, and perform the\r\nwork quicker and cheaper than the Norag, and of course they are much\r\ncleaner, the straw not being trampled and defiled.  They are\r\ncomplicated, owing to the fact that the straw must be chopped and\r\nrendered soft to the touch, as the oxen will not eat it when it is not\r\nbruised--a serious matter, this, in a country where cattle are almost\r\nentirely fed upon straw.  It might be argued that, as in England, the\r\nwheat and other stalks might be cut up by machinery into chaff; but the\r\nexplanation is simple.  The haulm or stalk of cereals in a hot country\r\nlike Egypt grows harder and more woody than that of colder climates, and\r\nwhen simply cut up into chaff the product is so harsh that the\r\nunfortunate animals find that it soon produces soreness of the mouth,\r\nand reject it in consequence as being unfit for food.  The sample of\r\ngrain after being threshed by the Norag is often, however, mixed with\r\nparticles of earth, as some of the crop has been pulled up by the roots.\r\nBut as most of the wheat is consumed in the country the people do not\r\nobject to a dirty sample.\r\n\r\nThe total value of one of these crops may be taken at nine pounds 10\r\nshillings per acre.  The cost of raising one acre of wheat, ploughing,\r\nlabour, watering, up till harvesting, may be estimated at one pound 10\r\nshillings, and the yield may be thirty-five bushels grain and one and a\r\nhalf tons straw.  The weight of grain per imperial bushel is sixty-four\r\npounds, and the price per five bushels one pound.  Algerian and Italian\r\nwheats have been tried, and the results have been fairly encouraging.\r\nEnglish varieties have also been experimented with, but invariably have\r\nresulted in failure through bad germination.\r\n\r\n*Barley*.--The native variety, Baladi, is mainly grown.  The head is\r\nfour-rowed, and about two and a half inches long.  It is sown in\r\nNovember and December.  Seeding, the same as for wheat.  Seed, two\r\nbushels per acre.  First watering, sixty days after sowing; second and\r\nlast watering, fifty days after the first.  Harvest commences April\r\n15th.  Reaping the same as for wheat.  Cost of raising one acre, one\r\npound 5 shillings.  Yield of a good average crop, sixty bushels grain\r\nand one and a quarter tons straw.  The weight of grain per bushel is\r\nfifty-seven pounds, and the price ten shillings per five bushels.  Total\r\nvalue per acre, 7 pounds 10 shillings.  The barley is fed to horses\r\nmules, donkeys, and camels, while the natives make it into bread after\r\nmixing it with wheat in equal proportions.  Egyptian barley grown in the\r\nDelta is not good for malting purposes, the grain not being \"plump.\"  In\r\n1893, by way of experiment, a few foreign varieties were grown in Egypt,\r\nprincipally with a view to providing a good malting sample.\r\n\r\nScotch Chevalier barley gave the best results.  A sample from the crop\r\nof 1895, grown from seed raised in the country, was awarded the first\r\nprize for barley grown out of England at the Brewers' Exhibition,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe yield was not so heavy as with native barley, being as eight is to\r\ntwelve; but it furnished more straw.  The money value in England was\r\nChevalier, 1 pound 9 shillings, as compared to 17 shillings for native\r\nbarley; but the European barleys are more difficult to grow, and if not\r\nreaped before becoming dead ripe the heads break off and fall to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nBarley is grown on the Libyan Desert (Mariout), west from Alexandria,\r\nand is entirely dependent on the rains in winter.  It is sown by the\r\nBedouins in October--to await the rains which may fall in November or\r\nDecember--and also after a rainfall.  As the Bedouin is not an\r\nagriculturist, he scatters one and a quarter bushels per acre, and\r\nscratches the ground by the aid of a small plough, to which is yoked a\r\ncamel or donkey.\r\n\r\nThis soil is of a rich yellow colour, sandy loam, fine level tracts of\r\nit extending to a thousand acres or more.  To obtain a good supply of\r\nwater, wells are dug to a depth of forty feet or so, and the supply is\r\nfairly good.  Perennial irrigation can be resorted to by means of these\r\nwells.\r\n\r\nIf the rains are propitious, the Bedouin may reap crops of barley, with\r\nextremely varied returns, running, as they do, from two and a half to\r\ntwenty bushels per acre, the price received on the spot being 15\r\nshillings per five bushels.  Ninety per cent, of the barley goes to\r\nEngland for malting.\r\n\r\nNext come, in the rotation,\r\n\r\n*Maize (Nileh)*.--Main crop on land after cereal crops.  Sown end of\r\nJuly.  Seed, about one bushel per acre, dropped in the furrow by a boy\r\nimmediately behind the plough.  First watering, twenty-five days after\r\nsowing; second fifteen days after; third twelve days, fourth twelve\r\ndays, fifth ten days, sixth eight days, and seventh eight days, seven\r\nirrigations being necessary in this dry and thirsty land for the\r\nproduction of the crop.  One cultivation is given by hand hoe after the\r\nfirst watering.  The maize grows quickly, attaining to a height of seven\r\nfeet, and occupies the ground one hundred days.  Cost of raising, two\r\npounds 6 shillings.  Yield per acre, fifty bushels; value, 8 pounds 10\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nMaize is a most important crop in Egypt, as upon this grain the natives\r\ndepend for the bulk of their food.  Ground into flour and mixed with\r\nFenugreek seed, it is baked into bread.  Five varieties of this grain\r\nare grown, but the best kinds are known by the natives as \"Baladi,\"\r\n\"Biltani,\" and \"Nab-el-Gamal.\"  As Indian corn is a surface feeder a\r\nliberal application of farmyard manure is necessary to secure a full\r\ncrop.  Harvest begins in the middle of November.  The stalks are cut and\r\ncarted to the threshing-floor.  Then the cobs are pulled from the stalks\r\nand spread out to dry for thirty days, when they are put into the\r\ngranaries.  To separate the grain from the cobs, hand shellers are\r\nemployed, or it is beaten out by sticks.\r\n\r\nFor a catch crop on land after wheat and barley, Sesame may be sown in\r\nthe beginning of June.  There are two varieties, the Red and the White.\r\nSix pounds of seed will sow one acre, broadcasted and ploughed in by the\r\nnative implement.  The duration of the growth is five months.  The crop\r\nreceives one hand-hoeing and five waterings.  It is harvested in October\r\nbefore it becomes dead ripe, to prevent the shedding of seed.  Sesame is\r\ngrown for the sake of the oil, which it yields to the extent of over\r\nfifty per cent.  This oil is used for domestic purposes, especially by\r\nthe upper class Egyptians.  The production of seed per acre is about\r\ntwenty-five bushels, valued at 13 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Upper Egypt a great deal of land is sown with the\r\nDourra (_Holcus douta_), which is largely consumed by the peasantry,\r\nforming, as it does, one of their staple foods.  It is a very useful and\r\nsuitable plant.  It is sometimes eaten like maize or Indian corn in a\r\ngreen state, being previously roasted on the fire, or green like\r\nsugar-cane.  Its pith, when dried, is used as starch; while the leaves\r\nmake excellent provender for cattle.\r\n\r\nWe now have to consider the last crop in the rotation, namely clover\r\npreceding cotton.  As part of the land after wheat and barley has\r\nremained fallow, and advantage has been taken to level, clean, and flood\r\nwith Nile water rich in deposits, \"Miscowy\" clover is sown broadcast,\r\nwhen the surface of the land is covered with three inches of water.  As\r\nthe water sinks into the soil the seed germinates upon the surface,\r\nwhich is now composed of fine silt.  Sown in the middle of September,\r\nthe first crop should be ready for cutting or pasturing about November\r\n5th.  During the period of growth the crop has received three waterings.\r\nImmediately after the clearing a watering is given, and the second\r\ncutting should be ready in seventy days.  After eating off, the land is\r\nploughed for the cotton crop.\r\n\r\n\"Fachl\" clover is stronger in the stem than that known as \"Miscowy,\" and\r\ngrows as a tall, luxuriant crop.  It is sown amongst the stalks of the\r\nmaize in the end of October, the land having previously been watered,\r\nand by the time the maize is ready for cutting, the clover has attained\r\na height of five inches.  The crop should be ready for cutting about the\r\nmiddle of January.  Generally it is disposed of by the acre--to be cut\r\nand removed from the land, and sold in bunches to be fed to carriage\r\nhorses, precisely as the green tares and clover are brought into London\r\nin bunches during the spring time of the year.  The value of one cutting\r\nis 5 pounds per acre.  Unlike the \"Miscowy\" variety, the \"Fachl\" only\r\nyields one crop, as the roots fail.  The land is then broken up for the\r\ncrop of cotton.  This finishes the three years' rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to add a few remarks on a system of cultivation\r\nwhich is practised on tracts adjoining the Desert.  The land has been\r\npurchased at a price of, say, 17 pounds per acre, and the next\r\nproceeding has been to level it--by the free use of the Cassabia, or\r\nscraper, which, in roughest preparation, is drawn over and over the sand\r\nand guided something after the fashion of a plough--and then bringing it\r\ninto communication by canalising with the nearest distributor of the\r\nNile water, while in this country of exceedingly cheap labour the cost\r\nof these preparations for cultivation may be set down at about 10 pounds\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nThis done, the purchaser has the option of carrying on the cultivation\r\nhimself, or letting it to the fellaheen, who will take it readily and\r\npay a rent of 4 pounds per acre or feddan.\r\n\r\nThe fellah now crops his land as follows, and the reader will notice the\r\nvariation in the products the native causes his fields to bring forth.\r\n\r\nHe begins with:\r\n\r\n*Earth Nuts (_Arachidis_)*.--Sown from April 1st till July 1st.\r\nDuration of crops, six months.  Water every five days till high Nile,\r\nwhen no water is required.  Yield per acre, sixty bushels, value 10\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n*Sesame*.--Yield, fifteen bushels; value, 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n*Chick Peas*.--Sown from April 1st to July 1st.  Duration of crop, six\r\nmonths.  Yield per acre, thirty bushels; value, 6 pounds.\r\n\r\n*Maize (Oswego)*.--Sown March 15th till April 15th.  Duration of crop,\r\nseven months; value of crop, 9 pounds.\r\n\r\n*Potatoes*.--First crop planted October.  Duration, three and a half\r\nmonths.  Yield, three and a half tons; 17 pounds 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n*Potatoes*.--Second crop planted February 15th.  Duration, three months.\r\nYield, three and a half tons; 17 pounds 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n*Lupins*.--Sown November 1st.  Duration of crop, seven months.  Average\r\nyield, fifteen bushels; 2 pounds 8 shillings.\r\n\r\nClover, barley, beans, Syrian maize, and henna, a dye plant.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the land is here generally pure sand, but after flooding\r\nwith Nile water, which is often available without pumping--_i.e._ free\r\nflow--the sand gets mixed with the Nile mud and a good soil is rapidly\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n*Sugar-Cane*.--This, one of the most interesting products of the Eastern\r\nsoil, beautiful in form, and attractive in every stage, from its early\r\ngreen growth through the tasselling, or flowering, up to the time when\r\nthe swelling cobs are changing from their attractive green to golden\r\nyellow, amber, and brownish or purple black, is cultivated both in Upper\r\nand Lower Egypt.  It is grown in two varieties, the native and the\r\nGreek, and the colour of the ripened canes forms a gradation, passing\r\nfrom light yellow through striped red and yellow, and red.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation is, as stated, principally carried on in Upper Egypt--\r\nfor the manufacture of sugar.  If it is planted in the Delta it is for\r\nsale to the natives, by whom it is consumed raw, and by sucking the\r\njuice.  The farmer who plants his land with sugar-cane begins by\r\nthoroughly well preparing the soil, and ridges it as if he were about to\r\nplant potatoes, these ridges measuring about thirty inches from crest to\r\ncrest.\r\n\r\nThe canes are cut into lengths of one yard, placed in the furrow, and\r\ncovered with the soil.  Planting commences in February, the ridges being\r\nwatered immediately after, and the young shoots appear after twenty\r\ndays.  The crop is watered every fifteen days, and at longer intervals\r\nafter the Nile has risen.  The land is hand-hoed three times, and the\r\ncane should be ready for cutting in December and January.  The value of\r\nan average crop sold standing--in Lower Egypt--may range from 20 to 25\r\npounds per acre.  Then the trashings covering the ridges are burned, a\r\nwatering given about the beginning of March, and the old roots sprout\r\nagain, when there is a second crop, and again the following year by\r\nrepeating, a third crop from the one planting.  The third crop is not so\r\nprofitable, as the roots become exhausted.  The sugar-cane requires a\r\nliberal dressing of manure each year.  The yield of trashed canes may\r\nrun from six tons the first year, five tons the second year, and four\r\ntons the third year, and the percentage of sugar may be estimated from\r\nfourteen to fifteen per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nRice is extensively cultivated in the districts of Rosetta, Damietta,\r\nFouah, and Facous; but it is the opinion of a very excellent authority\r\nthat rice cultivation and the growth of this grain, which is seen at its\r\nbest in the swamps of Asia, will gradually die out of Egypt and become a\r\nthing of the past.  For, given ample water and a level of mud in which\r\nthe planter may thrust in the plant in its early green state of blades,\r\nan abundant crop is pretty sure; but now that Egypt is becoming more and\r\nmore in a state of transition, with good drainage extending, and modern\r\napplications at work for the proper washing and purifying of a soil that\r\nis impregnated with salt and soda, this country will no longer be the\r\npaddy field of yore, and the culture of rice may well be relegated to\r\nthe mud swamps of the countries farther east.\r\n\r\nThere is no cause for regret here, for, in comparison with those easier\r\nof production, rice is far from being one of the best crops that can be\r\nsown.  Among farmers and gardeners there is a term known as sickness of\r\nthe land, marked by a want of vigour in its productions; and in Egypt\r\nthis may be produced by the want of that great sustainer of plant life,\r\ndecaying vegetable matter, or the impregnation of the soil with some\r\nform of salt, soda in the main.\r\n\r\nWith the improved farming now going on, the natural soil, which was once\r\nready enough in its production of rice, is rapidly changing its\r\ncharacter, constant tillage, the flooding and washing which carry out\r\nthe efflorescing salts, and the constant addition of vegetable manures,\r\naided by one or two crops of clover, being the agents which are working\r\nthis alteration.\r\n\r\nThere are five varieties of rice grown in Egypt, namely Sultani, Fino,\r\nSabeini, Indian, and Japan.  In regard to quality, the Fino occupies the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nThe sowing commences in the middle of April, and continues till June.\r\nThe crop occupies the land from three to six months, according to the\r\nvariety grown.  The rice for seeding is put into water for twelve days,\r\nthen taken out and drained for two more.  It is subsequently emptied out\r\nof the sacks on to a floor and covered with hay, to remain four days\r\ntill heating and germination take place.  Then the seed is sown on the\r\nland, which is covered with four inches of water, this being drained off\r\nafter three days, leaving the seed for twelve hours exposed to the sun.\r\nThen water is allowed to flow on to the plot once more, and a portion to\r\ndrain off, the surface at this later stage always having a covering of\r\nfrom four to five inches in depth, so that the irrigation is always\r\nfresh.  This is continued during the growth of the crop.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting is in October and November, and the yield of an acre may\r\naverage fifty bushels of Paddy, which, when shelled, or husked, will\r\ngive twenty bushels of clean rice, valued at 6 pounds 10 shillings per\r\ntwenty bushels.  The straw may be estimated at a ton per acre, and be\r\nvalued at one pound per ton.\r\n\r\nRice is one of the chief foods of the Egyptian, and it is an excellent\r\ncrop to grow on newly redeemed land, provided that water is abundant;\r\nfor the soil is impregnated with salt, and after a few crops have been\r\ntaken off the land becomes \"sweet,\" in consequence of the perpetual\r\nflooding.  It can then be cropped with clover and cotton, but requires\r\nmuch labour in the way of weeding, transplanting to fill up blanks, and\r\nattention to irrigation.  After paying rent and working expenses the\r\nmargin of profit is not great.  The size of the plots ranges from half\r\nto one and a half acres.  The patches are encircled by drains or\r\nditches, which discharge into the main irrigating system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nIf armed with the little enterprise and capital necessary for making a\r\ncommencement in farming or growing fruit and vegetables in Egypt for the\r\nmarket, a cultivator would find that land could be obtained within easy\r\nreach of the great towns of the Delta--Cairo and Alexandria--at a very\r\nmoderate price; but it is only right to add that this price, consequent\r\nupon the great irrigation schemes in progress, is still rising by leaps\r\nand bounds.  For the soil, where reachable by the flood waters of the\r\nNile, now conserved and carried in every direction by irrigation canals,\r\nis practically inexhaustible, and, as previously stated, is often of\r\ngreat depth.\r\n\r\nThe land is to be purchased with proper titles and registration, giving\r\nthe necessary security to an alien who is desirous of making his home in\r\nthe Delta, or rented, if preferred, at a moderate consideration,\r\nincluding water for irrigation.  The country is well policed, there is\r\nfreedom from contact with the inhabitants of the surrounding desert, and\r\na cultivator would have to deal with a quiet, docile people, fairly\r\nindustrious--that is to say, lovers of work after the fashion of the\r\ncalm, placid Moslem, who takes life as it is, and seems to make it one\r\nof his tenets that there is no need to hurry.\r\n\r\nHe possesses none of the hurry and rush of Western civilisation; but, on\r\nthe other hand, he is patient, ignorant, fairly teachable, and willing\r\nto work for exceedingly moderate daily payment.  The supply of this\r\nlabour under a kindly, solvent, and honestly paying master is abundant\r\nand never fails.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of the fellaheen farm labourers and their wives are\r\ntypical of the class of people with whom he would have to deal, and if\r\nthe new adventurer objected to the class of hut they occupy, and had\r\nlofty ideas about model dwellings and the introduction of lighter\r\nimplements in place of the clumsy, adze-like hoes with which they are\r\narmed rather than furnished, the advice given to him would be to follow\r\nthat of the old Latin proverb, \"Festina lente,\" and go by degrees in\r\nthat, as in most of the other matters of culture, for it takes time to\r\nalter custom and change old-fashioned routine.\r\n\r\nIt may be here added that all great advance and reversals of custom\r\nshould be cautiously attempted with the land.  Still Nature is easier to\r\ndeal with than man, and less likely to resent alteration when attempted\r\nby a practised hand.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, for the encouragement of those who wish to try the\r\nexperiment in a foreign land, let them understand that farming in Egypt\r\nis child's play compared to that in Great Britain.  There are no wet hay\r\nand cereal harvests, there is neither snow nor frost to damage the\r\ncrops, no high winds, no floods, no ground game to do mischief:\r\n\r\nIn the season of hay-making, with no possibility of a drop of rain\r\nfalling, the fellah makes the worst of all hay by allowing it to be\r\nburnt to an indigestible fibre--would that he had a training in the\r\nuncertain climate of Great Britain!  The wheat is harvested when dead\r\nripe.  Part may be cut, and part may be allowed to remain for six weeks\r\nwithout deterioration.  A contrast this to the harvests in bonnie\r\nScotland, where the corn has lain sodden until it has rotted away in the\r\ndeplorable weather of the year 1903.\r\n\r\nThere is a good old proverb that is applicable to most things--certainly\r\nto farming in Egypt.  It is that \"the less there is to do, the worse it\r\nis done.\"  Verily it is so here.  Nature is most kindly, and with ample\r\nmoisture, abundant fertilisation, and plenteous sunshine, she does\r\npretty well half of the fellahs' work thoroughly well, while their half\r\nto complete the operations is carried out with a careless indifference\r\nto success that is deplorable.  The people's wants are few, and now that\r\nunder a generous rule they have liberty and payment for the work they\r\nperform, they seem quite content to plod on in easy slothfulness.\r\nSufficient for the day is the evil thereof, so why wear themselves out\r\nby toil and the struggle for things better than those which surround\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAll this in connection with the possibilities of this country raises the\r\nquestion, Can the practice of Egyptian agriculture be improved?\r\n\r\nThe answer of one who has toiled amongst the people for years, whose\r\nwork has been that of reclaiming tracts of desert land, making endless\r\nexperiments as to the best suited crops for Egypt and the best ways of\r\nproducing them, is: Emphatically, yes!\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Khedive's Country, by George Manville Fenn",
