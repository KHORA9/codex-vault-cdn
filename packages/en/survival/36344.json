It was given to the\r\nChief of the United States Weather Bureau when the department was first\r\nestablished by Congress, and its source lay in the phrase, \"It is\r\nprobable,\" with which all the weather predictions began. But Old\r\nProbabilities, genial prophet and lover of his fellow men, is passing\r\naway, for the officer who organized the Weather Bureau became in time\r\ndispleased with the name and changed the form of the daily prediction so\r\nas to read, \"The indications are.\" The phrase is formal and severe.\r\nThere is naught but cold comfort in it. Our hearts turn back fondly to\r\nOld Probabilities and his friendly assurance: \"It is _probable_ that\r\ntomorrow will be fair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chickamauga Park, Tenn., in an Ice Storm]\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER\r\n\r\nBy CHARLES FITZHUGH TALMAN\r\n\r\n_Librarian of the U.

Y., under the act of March 3, 1879. Copyright, 1916,\r\n    by The Mentor Association, Inc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to lay too much stress upon the unimportant aspects of\r\nweather. It furnishes a bit of conversation over the teacups; it\r\naccentuates the twinges of rheumatism; it spoils a holiday. All this,\r\nhowever, is mere byplay.\r\n\r\nThe real work of the weather--the work that explains the existence of\r\ncostly weather bureaus, such as the one upon which our Government spends\r\nmore than a million and a half dollars annually--is momentous beyond\r\ncalculation. Consider such facts and figures as these:\r\n\r\nThe head of the British Meteorological Office recently declared that bad\r\nweather costs the farmers of the British Isles about one hundred million\r\ndollars a year. In our own country it has been estimated that a\r\ndifference of one inch in the rainfall occurring during July in six\r\nStates means a difference of two hundred and fifty million dollars in\r\nthe value of the corn (maize) crop. The world over, the damage wrought\r\nby hail-storms is said to average about two hundred million dollars a\r\nyear. In the city of Galveston a single hurricane once destroyed twenty\r\nmillion dollars' worth of property and six thousand human lives. Thus we\r\nmight proceed indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that man's welfare is conditioned to an enormous extent and\r\nin an endless variety of ways by the vicissitudes of the atmosphere;\r\nhence the study of weather--meteorology--is one of the most important\r\nof sciences. It is also one of the most strikingly neglected!\r\n\r\nAt the office of the Weather Bureau in Washington there is a\r\nmeteorological library of some thirty-five thousand volumes. But\r\nmeteorological libraries are rare; meteorological books are scarce in\r\nother libraries; and meteorologists are so uncommon that whoever\r\ndeclares himself one is likely to be asked, \"What _is_ a meteorologist?\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: STATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\n    Showing two extreme types: one, an office on the twenty-ninth floor\r\n    of the Whitehall Building, New York City, with instruments installed\r\n    on the roof; the other, an independent observatory building, with\r\n    free exposure on all sides, at St. Joseph, Mo.]\r\n\r\nThe \"meteors\" studied by the meteorologist are not shooting stars, but\r\nthe phenomena of the atmosphere,--rain and snow, cloud and fog, wind and\r\nsunshine, and whatever else enters into the composition of weather and\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nThe ocean of air in which human beings live, even as deep-sea fishes\r\nlive at the bottom of the liquid ocean, is called the _atmosphere_.\r\nUnlike the liquid ocean, it diminishes rapidly in density from the\r\nbottom upward. At an altitude of three and one-half miles it is only\r\nhalf as dense as at sea-level. This is higher than the highest permanent\r\nhabitations of man. Mountain-climbers and balloonists have attained\r\ngreater altitudes; but above a level of about five miles the air is too\r\ngreatly rarefied to support life. Balloonists who ascend still higher\r\nmust carry a supply of oxygen with them. A little above the ten-mile\r\nlevel the air is only one-eighth as dense as at sea-level. The\r\natmosphere extends at least 300 miles above the earth, at which height\r\nits density is computed to be only one two-millionth as great as at\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nThe weather with which human beings are concerned may be said to extend\r\nupward seven or eight miles; _i.e._, to the level of the higher clouds.\r\nThe layer of the atmosphere lying between sea-level and the upper cloud\r\nlevel has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the air above\r\nit, and is known as the _troposphere_.\r\n\r\nThe heating of the atmosphere by the sun is the beginning of all\r\nweather, and the temperature of the air is the most important weather\r\nelement. As soon as we begin to study atmospheric temperature, we\r\nencounter a paradox. The heat of the air is all derived from the sun\r\n(except a minute quantity from the interior of the earth, and an\r\ninfinitesimal quantity from other heavenly bodies), and it would\r\ntherefore seem at first glance that the upper layers of the atmosphere\r\nshould be warmer than the lower. Experience proves the reverse to be the\r\ncase. A mountain overgrown with tropical vegetation on its lower slopes\r\nis, if high enough, crowned with eternal snows. A thermometer carried\r\nupward in the air shows under average conditions a fall of temperature\r\nof one degree (Fahrenheit) for every 300 feet of ascent. This fall of\r\ntemperature with ascent continues to the upper limit of the troposphere,\r\nwhere the average temperature is something like 70 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE NEW IDEA IN WEATHER OBSERVATORIES\r\n\r\n    The Observatory of the Ebro (Spain), founded by Spanish Jesuits, is\r\n    devoted to studying the interrelations of sun, earth and air. Its\r\n    admirable equipment includes apparatus for the direct and\r\n    spectroscopic study of the sun, for measuring solar radiation,\r\n    atmospheric electricity, earth currents, terrestrial magnetism, and\r\n    earthquakes; besides the ordinary routine of a meteorological\r\n    observatory. The results of all these observations are published\r\n    side by side, to facilitate comparison.]\r\n\r\nAbove the troposphere is a region called the _stratosphere_, or\r\n_isothermal layer_, in which an ascending thermometer shows irregular\r\nand generally small changes of temperature--not infrequently a rise of\r\ntemperature with ascent. The exploration of the stratosphere is one of\r\nthe most fascinating fields of meteorological research, but lies\r\nsomewhat beyond the scope of an essay on weather. It is carried out\r\nchiefly with the aid of small free balloons, some of which (sounding\r\nballoons) bear self-registering thermometers and other instruments,\r\nwhile others (pilot balloons) bear no instruments, but show by their\r\nmovements the drift of the air currents. The greatest altitude ever\r\nattained by a sounding-balloon was 21.8 miles; by a pilot-balloon, 24.2\r\nmiles. The branch of meteorology dealing with the study of the upper air\r\nis called _aerology_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A LONELY OUTPOST ON THE VERGE OF THE ANTARCTIC\r\n\r\n    The Argentine meteorological station in the South Orkneys. Once a\r\n    year an expedition is sent from Buenos Aires to relieve the staff of\r\n    four observers. This is the southernmost permanently inhabited spot\r\n    on the globe; and it has not even wireless communication with the\r\n    rest of the world.]\r\n\r\nReverting to the temperature of man's environment, the reason why the\r\natmosphere is warmest at the bottom is this: The sun's rays come to us\r\nfrom outer space in the form of vibrations in the ether, and warm the\r\nair to only a slight extent in passing through it. They are absorbed by\r\nthe ground, and converted into heat waves. The air is then warmed by\r\ncontact with the warm ground. Lastly, the warming of the lower air gives\r\nrise to air-currents, which distribute the heat through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROMETRIC PRESSURE\r\n\r\nIf our weather were uniform, it would furnish little matter for\r\nconversation; in fact, would hardly be weather at all. Changeableness is\r\nthe salient feature of weather, and to understand weather changes one\r\nmust know something about barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nLike all other forms of matter, the invisible air has weight. At\r\nsea-level it exerts a downward pressure averaging 14.7 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. Atmospheric pressure is measured by means of an instrument\r\ncalled the _barometer_, in which the weight of the air is balanced\r\nagainst a column of mercury. As the height of the mercurial column\r\nvaries with the pressure of the air, and is taken as the measure of the\r\nlatter, we follow the practice of expressing pressure (a force) in\r\nlinear units (inches or millimeters). This practice is retained even in\r\nthe use of the aneroid barometer, which contains no mercurial column.\r\nHence, when we say that the average barometric pressure at sea-level is\r\n29.92 \"inches,\" we are really expressing in a roundabout way the weight\r\nof the air at that level.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HOW THE CAMERA ANALYZES LIGHTNING\r\n\r\n    The same flashes photographed with (_a_) a stationary camera, and\r\n    (_b_) a camera revolving on a vertical axis. One of the flashes is\r\n    seen to have consisted of several successive discharges along an\r\n    identical path\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of U. S. Bureau of Standards and Popular Science Monthly.]\r\n\r\nBarometric pressure not only varies somewhat regularly with\r\naltitude--diminishing as we ascend--but also less regularly from place\r\nto place in a horizontal direction, and from time to time at a given\r\nplace. In studying the weather meteorologists frequently wish to compare\r\nthe barometric pressures prevailing at a certain time at a number of\r\nplaces lying in the same horizontal plane. Given a system of\r\nmeteorological stations scattered over a certain territory, the first\r\nstep is to secure simultaneous readings of the barometers at these\r\nstations. Then, if the stations are at various altitudes, as they\r\ncommonly are, corrections must be applied to the readings to reduce all\r\nto a common plane; the plane adopted for this purpose is sea-level.\r\nSince most stations are _above_ sea-level, and since atmospheric\r\npressure diminishes with altitude, reduction to sea-level generally\r\ninvolves applying an _additive_ correction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER MAP\r\n\r\nNow please attend carefully to what follows; because I am going to\r\nattempt to put into a minimum number of words the essential facts\r\nconcerning the _weather map_, the best clue to weather mysteries yet\r\ndevised by man.\r\n\r\nAt about 200 stations of the Weather Bureau, distributed over the United\r\nStates, the barometer and other meteorological instruments are read\r\ntwice a day; viz., at 8 A. M. and 8 P. M., eastern standard time. The\r\nreadings are promptly telegraphed in cipher to Washington, where they\r\nare entered on a map.\r\n\r\nThe barometer readings at the different stations, reduced to sea-level\r\nas just explained, will vary, say, from 29 to 31 inches. Lines, called\r\n_isobars_, are now drawn through places having the same pressure; the\r\nintervals between the lines corresponding to differences in pressure of\r\none-tenth of an inch. Lines (_isotherms_) are also drawn to connect\r\nplaces having the same temperature, a little arrow at each station shows\r\nthe direction of the wind at that point, and various other symbols are\r\nused to facilitate the interpretation of the map; but the isobars are\r\nmore important than anything else.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CIRRO-STRATUS\r\n\r\n    The appearance of this cloud precedes by a day or so the arrival of\r\n    rainy and stormy weather]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALTO-CUMULUS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS\r\n\r\n    This cloud marks the summit of an ascending air current, and appears\r\n    toward midday or early afternoon in the warm season. When the air\r\n    rises powerfully to great heights, cumulus is built up in\r\n    mountainous masses and may become cumulo-nimbus, the thundercloud.]\r\n\r\nHere is the weather map for the morning of January 9, 1886. The solid\r\ncurved lines are isobars, representing barometric pressures ranging all\r\nthe way from 28.7 to 30.8 inches. It will be seen at a glance that these\r\nlines tend to assume roughly circular forms, inclosing regions where the\r\npressure is lower or higher than the average. Moreover, the little\r\narrows (which \"fly with the wind\") show that the winds round a center\r\nof low pressure tend to blow in a direction contrary to that followed by\r\nthe hands of a clock (in the southern hemisphere the reverse is true),\r\nbut instead of blowing in circles are inclined somewhat inward toward\r\nthe center. Round a center of high pressure (in the northern hemisphere)\r\nthe typical circulation of the winds is exactly opposite (\"clockwise,\"\r\nand inclined outward), though the accompanying map does not show this\r\nparticularly well.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WEATHER MAP JANUARY 9, 1886]\r\n\r\nAn area of low pressure, with its system of winds, is called a\r\n_cyclone_, or _low_. An area of high pressure, with its system of winds,\r\nis called an _anticyclone_, or _high_. Note that a cyclone is not\r\nnecessarily a storm, though the one shown on this map, with its center\r\nnot far from New York City, was a very violent storm, which, when this\r\nmap was drawn, was sweeping up the Atlantic coast. (Popular usage\r\napplies the term \"cyclone\" to the tornado.) The strength of the winds in\r\na cyclone depends upon the contrast in barometric pressure between its\r\ncenter and its outer border. A cyclone with crowded isobars always has\r\nstrong winds; when the isobars are widely spaced the winds are gentle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ASCENT OF A SOUNDING BALLOON\r\n\r\n    The first made in the United States; at St. Louis, Mo., in 1904]\r\n\r\nThese areas of low and high pressure, in addition to their movements\r\nabout their centers, move bodily across the country, in a general\r\nwest-to-east direction, at an average speed of over 500 miles a day.\r\nThis double movement may be compared to that of a carriage-wheel,\r\nrotating and advancing at the same time. Most of our cyclones enter the\r\ncountry from the Canadian North-west--though many come from other\r\nregions--and nearly all of them pass off to sea in the neighborhood of\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence. Their route across the country varies greatly,\r\ndepending in part upon the season.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE KITE HOUSE AT AN AEROLOGICAL OBSERVATORY\r\n\r\n    Some of the kites are much the worse for wear after flying in a\r\n    storm]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER IN CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES\r\n\r\nBarometric pressure is not an element of weather, in the ordinary sense\r\nof the term, since the fluctuations of pressure that occur in the human\r\nenvironment are entirely inappreciable to the senses. We have seen,\r\nhowever, that pressure is intimately related to wind, which is a weather\r\nelement of much importance. In noting that systems of high and low\r\npressure are constantly traveling across the country, and that they are\r\naccompanied by winds having fairly definite characteristics in relation\r\nto each, we have taken an important step toward bringing order out of\r\nthe (to the uninitiated) chaotic sequence of weather. Obviously, a\r\nsystem of telegraphic weather reports makes it possible to keep close\r\nwatch of these wind systems, and, from their locations on today's\r\nweather map, to form some idea where they will be tomorrow. Thus the\r\nweather forecaster is enabled to give notice of the imminence of those\r\nviolent winds that destroy life and property at sea, and, to a less\r\nextent, on land. There is an element of uncertainty in such\r\npredictions--since storms, unlike railway trains, are not confined to\r\nfixed routes and regular schedules--but the practised forecaster\r\nacquires an instinct that helps him to forestall their vagaries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SENDING UP A METEOROLOGICAL BALLOON ON LAKE CONSTANCE\r\n\r\n    Between Switzerland and Germany.]\r\n\r\nNow what is true of wind is also true to a certain extent of the other\r\nelements of weather,--they bear typical relations to the distribution of\r\natmospheric pressure. Cyclones are usually preceded by rising\r\ntemperature and accompanied by cloudiness and rain or snow;\r\nanticyclones are usually preceded by falling temperature and attended by\r\nfair weather.\r\n\r\nReferring again to the map of January 9, 1886, and following the course\r\nof the isotherms, or temperature lines, we see that abnormally cold\r\nweather prevailed over the Middle Western and Southern States. The\r\nisotherm of zero dips far south across northern Texas, Arkansas,\r\nMississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee; while in the upper Mississippi and\r\nMissouri Valleys the temperatures were from 20 to 40 degrees below zero.\r\nThese regions were, in fact, in the grip of a severe \"cold wave,\" which\r\nhad entered the country a day or two before, preceding the anticyclone\r\nhere seen central north of Dakota. Cold northwesterly winds were\r\nsweeping over the Great Plains, and as far south as the Gulf.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HOARFROST\r\n\r\n    Minute crystals of ice deposited from the air. Under a\r\n    magnifying-glass they show a variety of beautiful forms]\r\n\r\nThe same map shows typical weather accompanying the cyclone central on\r\nthe Atlantic coast. From the seaboard west to the Mississippi Valley\r\nrain or snow had fallen within the previous twenty-four hours (indicated\r\nby shading), and snow (indicated by S) was falling at the moment of\r\nobservation at a majority of stations within this area. Elsewhere in the\r\nsame region the weather was cloudy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks indicate in a general way the significance of the\r\nweather map and the principles upon which scientific weather predictions\r\nare based. The endless procession of highs and lows brings to any place\r\non the map constant alternations of heat and cold, storm and sunshine.\r\nThe forecaster watches the procession, and draws his inferences as to\r\nwhat will happen in this or that part of the country within the next day\r\nor two (forty-eight hours is about the limit of his outlook).\r\n\"Long-range\" forecasting is still a thing of the remote future.\r\nForecasts for a week in advance, are, indeed made by the Weather Bureau\r\nwith the aid of reports from a chain of stations extending round the\r\nglobe, but these are in very general terms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MARVIN RAIN AND SNOW GAGE\r\n\r\n    With trumpet-shaped wind-shield at top. In the middle is seen the\r\n    cylindrical collector. This is removed and weighed with its contents\r\n    to ascertain the amount of rain or snow that has fallen]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1914, the Bureau began publishing a \"daily weather map of\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere.\" This publication is, at present, suspended on\r\naccount of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WEATHER MISCELLANIES\r\n\r\nIt would require a book, rather than a brief essay, to describe all the\r\nvicissitudes of weather, and many books that attempt to do this have\r\nbeen written.[A] We have space here only to mention a few important\r\nfeatures of the weather met with in our own country.\r\n\r\n    [A] See \"Brief List of Meteorological Textbooks and Reference\r\n        Books,\" 3d ed., by C. Fitzhugh Talman. For sale by the\r\n        Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C. Price 5\r\n        cents.\r\n\r\nThe southern and southeastern part of a cyclone, some hundreds of miles\r\nfrom the center, is a favorite breeding-ground for _thunderstorms_ and\r\n_tornadoes_. Thunderstorms of the type known as \"heat thunderstorms\"\r\nalso occur with no special relation to cyclonic centers in regions where\r\nthe ground has been intensely heated. In either case the storm is built\r\nup by rapidly ascending air, which cools and condenses its water vapor,\r\nfirst into enormous clouds (_cumulo-nimbus_, or \"_thunderheads_\"), and\r\nthen into rain, frequently accompanied by hail. It would be necessary to\r\ngo to some length to explain the familiar electrical manifestations of\r\nthe thunderstorm--some points, indeed, are not perfectly clear to\r\nmeteorologists--but it should be stated that these are always the\r\nresult, not the cause, of the storm. _Lightning_ is an electrical\r\ndischarge between cloud and earth, or cloud and cloud, and _thunder_ is\r\nsimply the violent soundwave set up by the sudden expansion of the\r\nheated air along the path of the discharge,--the same acoustic\r\nphenomenon that accompanies an ordinary explosion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE EFFECTS OF AN ICE STORM AT CANTON, N. Y. March\r\n    25-27, 1913]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SUMMIT HOTEL AT SUMMIT, CAL.\r\n\r\n    On March 18, 1911. A three-story building whose first story is\r\n    buried under twenty-six feet of snow]\r\n\r\nA _tornado_ (popularly miscalled a \"cyclone\") is an extremely violent\r\nvortex in the air, usually less than 1,000 feet in diameter. Besides its\r\nvery rapid rotary motion, it has a progressive motion at a speed\r\naveraging forty or fifty miles an hour. Its position at any moment is\r\nmarked by a black funnel-shaped cloud, which grows downward from the sky\r\nand does not at all times reach the earth. A waterspout at sea is an\r\nidentical phenomenon, though usually less violent. Along its narrow path\r\nthe tornado demolishes everything,--wooden houses are blown to\r\nsplinters, trees uprooted or stripped of their branches, structures of\r\nheavy masonry laid in ruins. Something like a hundred lives are lost\r\neach year in these storms, on an average, and one of them (St. Louis,\r\nMay 27, 1896) destroyed thirteen million dollars' worth of property.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy of the Scientific American\r\n\r\n    A WATERSPOUT NEAR BEAUFORT, N.

This is one of several instruments designed to\r\n    register the natural electric waves, or \"strays,\" which sometimes\r\n    interfere seriously with the transmission of wireless telegrams.\r\n    Strays are often generated by lightning discharges, near or distant,\r\n    and this instrument therefore serves to give notice of an\r\n    approaching thunderstorm]\r\n\r\nA _blizzard_ is a high, cold wind, accompanied by blinding snow, which\r\nin winter sometimes blows out of the front of an advancing anticyclone,\r\nespecially in our North-Central States. A similar wind, with or without\r\nsnow, is called in Texas a _norther_.\r\n\r\nA _chinook_ is a warm, dry wind that descends the eastern slope of the\r\nRocky Mountains in Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, and flows\r\nnorth-eastward over the plains. Its effects are most pronounced in\r\nwinter, when it brings about a very sudden rise in the temperature--in\r\nextreme cases as much as forty degrees in fifteen minutes! It causes\r\nsnow to vanish as if by magic, and is appropriately nicknamed the\r\n\"snow-eater.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cloudburst_\" is merely a picturesque name for a very heavy shower;\r\nusually a thunder-shower.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IN THE WAKE OF A TORNADO\r\n\r\n    The tornado destroyed a house and barn, but left a path in the\r\n    center with practically no harm done]\r\n\r\n_West India hurricanes_ occasionally visit the United States, especially\r\nin the late summer and early autumn. These storms begin as violent\r\ncyclones of small extent (300 to 600 miles in diameter), usually\r\nsomewhere east of the West Indies, sweep in a long curve across the\r\nCaribbean Sea, and then turn north, either passing up along the\r\nAtlantic Coast or crossing the Gulf of Mexico into the southern United\r\nStates. Soon after entering the temperate zone they increase in size and\r\ndiminish in violence, but are still vigorous enough on reaching the Gulf\r\nor South Atlantic Coast to cause great devastation. Low-lying shores are\r\noften inundated by the immense waves they generate.\r\n\r\n_Cold waves_ are the rapid and severe falls in temperature that\r\nsometimes occur in winter, especially at the front of an anticyclone.\r\nWarnings of these occurrences, issued by the Weather Bureau twenty-four\r\nto thirty-six hours in advance, often result in the saving of millions\r\nof dollars' worth of merchandise susceptible to damage by freezing.\r\n\r\n_Frosts_ in the spring and autumn are also predicted with great success,\r\nto the immense advantage of farmers, market-gardeners, and\r\nhorticulturists. The practice of smudging or heating orchards, now so\r\nwidespread, is usually carried on under the advice of the Weather\r\nBureau, which gives prompt notice to the orchardist when such\r\nprecautions are in order. The bureau publishes charts showing the\r\naverage and extreme dates of the last frost in spring and the first\r\nfrost in autumn for all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING DOWN ON A SEA OF FOG FROM MT. TAMALPAIS,\r\n    CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nA _fog_ is a cloud resting on the surface of the earth. In the United\r\nStates fog is commonest along the northern and middle parts of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Coasts. In the interior of the country, especially\r\nthe western part, it is of rare occurrence, the average number of days a\r\nyear with fog being less than ten.\r\n\r\nLastly--weather fallacies are rife. _Indian summer_ is merely a type of\r\nmild, hazy, heavenly weather that prevails intermittently during our\r\nlong American autumns. The _equinoctial storm_ is a myth; the climate\r\nhas not \"changed\" anywhere within the span of a human lifetime (one year\r\ndiffers from another, but there is no progressive or permanent change);\r\nand the _moon_ has nothing whatever to do with THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY READING\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLIMATE AND WEATHER                             _By H.

It has always had a fearful sort of fascination for\r\nhumanity. To the ancients it came as a bolt of wrath from the hand of\r\nJove. To the fire-worshipers it was a warning message. To parched\r\ntravelers it was a bright promise, for it heralded the coming of rain.\r\nTo the superstitious it was a signal flash from the spirit world. And to\r\nthose of nervous temperament it was a highly disturbing phenomenon\r\nproducing emotions varying from uneasiness and alarm to hysteria. The\r\nquestion then, \"What is lightning and what causes it?\" has an interest\r\nfor all. I referred it to Mr. Talman, the author of the Mentor article\r\non \"The Weather.\" His reply follows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Not so many generations ago 'natural philosophers' thought that\r\ninflammable gases, exhaled from the earth, took fire spontaneously in\r\nthe air, and that this was lightning. The idea also prevailed--and it is\r\nnot yet quite extinct--that a stroke of lightning involved the hurling\r\ndown from the sky of a mass of rock, called a 'thunderbolt.' In the\r\neighteenth century people became quite familiar with the process of\r\ngenerating, by friction, a mysterious something called 'electricity,'\r\nwhich, when it passed from one body to another through a small layer of\r\nintervening air, produced sparks. Several philosophers noticed the\r\nresemblance between these sparks and lightning. It remained, however,\r\nfor Benjamin Franklin to prove that lightning was really an electrical\r\ndischarge on a large scale. The experiments by which he proposed to\r\ndemonstrate this were successfully performed, first by others, in\r\nFrance, and then, by Franklin himself, at Philadelphia. With the aid of\r\nhis famous kite he drew down from a thundercloud a little of the\r\n'electrical fluid' (as it was then called), and produced tiny sparks\r\nfrom an iron key at the lower end of the wet kite-string.\r\n\r\n\"We do not even yet know what electricity is, but we know a great deal\r\nabout the way it behaves and the effects it produces. There are two\r\nkinds of electricity, which we call _positive_ and _negative_. A body is\r\nsaid to be _charged_ when it has an excess of either kind, and the two\r\nkinds have a tendency to unite and neutralize each other's effects.\r\nThunderclouds become heavily charged with electricity. We are not quite\r\nsure how this happens, but it is now commonly believed that the strong\r\nuprising currents of air that occur in the storm, in the process of\r\nbreaking up the water-drops in the cloud also separate positive from\r\nnegative electricity; leaving the former in excess in the part of the\r\ncloud next to the earth, and carrying the latter far aloft.\r\n\r\n\"By a process called 'induction' the positive charge in the cloud draws\r\nan excess of negative electricity to the surface of the ground\r\nunderneath. The stronger the contrast between these opposite charges,\r\nthe harder they try to break through the interposing barrier of the air\r\n(which is a poor conductor of electricity) and to neutralize each other.\r\nAt length they succeed in doing so. A powerful stream of electricity\r\nflows for an instant between cloud and earth. Its passage heats the air\r\nand makes it luminous--just as the passage of an electric current heats\r\nthe filament of an electric lamp and makes it luminous. This is\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n\"These discharges occur not only between the clouds and the earth, but\r\nalso, and probably more often, between clouds charged with opposite\r\nkinds of electricity.\r\n\r\n\"The sudden expansion of the heated air along the path of the discharge\r\naffects our ears just as does the sudden expansion of the air at the\r\nmouth of a gun when it is fired. In each case a wave is sent through the\r\nair in all directions from the place of disturbance, and our ear-drums\r\nare set in vibration. That is thunder.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake courage then, you timid ones, who wince in the lightning's flash\r\nand tremble under the thunder's roll. Thunder is simply a vibration of\r\nyour ear drums--and, when you hear the thunder, be assured, all danger\r\nis over.\r\n\r\n                                             [Signature: W. D.

C.]\r\n\r\nWEATHER SERVICES AT HOME AND ABROAD\r\n\r\nMonograph Number One in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nPosted up in public offices, in hotel corridors, and other conspicuous\r\nplaces in our cities, the official weather map is a familiar sight. Even\r\nmore familiar is the official weather forecast, displayed, as a rule, on\r\nthe first page of the daily newspaper, and sent broadcast over the\r\ncountry on the little brown cards which one may see in the village\r\npostoffice as well as in the city drug-store. When a great storm sweeps\r\nover land or sea, detailed official reports concerning its progress and\r\ncharacteristics are published in the daily press. When a lawsuit\r\ninvolves a dispute as to the temperature or the state of the sky on a\r\ncertain day, the official weather records are consulted.\r\n\r\nHow much do you know about the branch of the national government that is\r\ncharged with the duty of keeping watch of the weather--recording its\r\nvagaries as they occur, and also predicting them, as far as is humanly\r\npossible?\r\n\r\nBesides its office in Washington, where more than two hundred persons\r\nare constantly employed, the Weather Bureau has about two hundred\r\nstations, manned by professional meteorologists and observers. One of\r\nthese will be found in almost every large city, while some are in towns\r\nof very modest importance. A regular Weather Bureau station is well\r\nworth a visit. The instrumental equipment of these stations is almost\r\nsuperhuman in the accuracy with which it sets down on paper the\r\nchronicle of weather happenings from day to day and from moment to\r\nmoment. Little less marvelous is the system by means of which weather\r\ninformation--past, present and future--is disseminated from these\r\nofficial foci. The postoffice, the telephone, the telegraph (wire and\r\nwireless) are all pressed into service to the fullest extent--especially\r\nin giving timely notice of approaching storms and other destructive\r\nforms of weather. These agencies are supplemented by visible and audible\r\nsignals, in the shape of flags, lanterns, railway whistles and so forth.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, the Weather Bureau does not exist primarily\r\nfor the purpose of telling the public (with a considerable margin of\r\nuncertainty) whether it will be advisable, on the morrow, to carry an\r\numbrella or wear an overcoat. The important work of the Bureau is\r\ntwofold. It consists, first, in the prediction of those atmospheric\r\nvisitations, such as storms, floods, and cold waves, which endanger life\r\nand property on a large scale; and, second, in the maintenance of the\r\nrecords that form the basis of climatic statistics. In both these\r\ndirections the Bureau splendidly justifies its existence.\r\n\r\nOur national weather service was founded in 1870, and for twenty years\r\nwas maintained by the Signal Corps of the Army. In 1890 it was\r\nestablished on the present basis, as the Weather Bureau of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nMost civilized countries possess official services for the observation\r\nand prediction of weather, though no other is organized on quite so\r\ngrandiose a scale as ours. The British Meteorological Office, the\r\nPrussian Meteorological Institute, the Central Meteorological Bureau of\r\nFrance, and the Central Physical Observatory of Petrograd are among the\r\nleading institutions of this character in the Old World. Admirable\r\nweather services also exist in India, Japan, Australia, Canada,\r\nArgentina and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SIMPLE WEATHER STATION]\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nMonograph Number Two in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of meteorological instruments dates back at least as far as\r\nthe fourth century before the Christian era, when the depth of rainfall\r\nwas measured in India by some form of gauge. We again hear of\r\nrain-gauges being used in Palestine in the first century of the present\r\nera. Thermometers with fixed scales were used in Italy in the\r\nseventeenth century, and the great Galileo, born in Pisa in 1564, took\r\npart in perfecting these instruments. Wind-vanes were known to the\r\nancients. The earliest one of which we have any record surmounted the\r\nfamous Tower of the Winds at Athens. In the Middle Ages the weathercock\r\nbecame the usual adornment of church steeples. The barometer was\r\ninvented by Torricelli in 1643.\r\n\r\nMost meteorological instruments, however, are of quite recent origin,\r\nand this is true especially of these types of apparatus that make\r\nautomatic records, thus replacing, to a large extent, the human\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nOur picture on the other side of this sheet shows the instruments used\r\nby the \"co-operative\" observers of the Weather Bureau. These observers,\r\nof whom there are about 4,500, well distributed over the country, serve\r\nthe government without pay, and their painstaking observations have\r\nalone made possible a detailed survey of our climate. In the picture we\r\nsee, on the right, an ordinary rain-gauge, and, on the left, a\r\nthermometer-screen containing two thermometers; viz., a maximum\r\nthermometer, for recording the highest temperature of the day, and a\r\nminimum thermometer, for recording the lowest. The screen, which is of\r\nwood, painted white, serves to shield the instruments from the rays of\r\nthe sun, while permitting free ventilation. Under these conditions the\r\nthermometers show the temperature of the _air_; whereas when exposed to\r\ndirect sunlight a thermometer shows the temperature acquired by the\r\ninstrument itself, and this may differ materially from the air\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this simple equipment, we find at a regular\r\nmeteorological station, or observatory, an impressive collection of\r\napparatus for observing and recording nearly all the elements of\r\nweather. The pressure of the air is measured by the mercurial barometer,\r\nand registered continuously by the barograph; the temperature of the air\r\nis automatically recorded by the thermograph. Other self-registering\r\ninstruments maintain continuous records of the force and direction of\r\nthe wind, the amount and duration of rainfall, the duration of sunshine,\r\nthe humidity of the air, etc. There are also instruments for measuring\r\nevaporation, the height and movement of clouds, the intensity of solar\r\nradiation, the elements of atmospheric electricity, and various other\r\nphenomena of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MAJESTIC CUMULUS CLOUD]\r\n\r\nCLOUDS AND RAINFALL\r\n\r\nMonograph Number Three in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Cloud Classification, now generally used by\r\nmeteorologists, is an amplification of one introduced by an\r\ningenious English Quaker, Luke Howard, in the year 1803. Howard\r\ndistinguished seven types of cloud, to which he gave the Latin names\r\n_cirrus_, _cumulus_, _stratus_, _cirro-cumulus_, _cirro-stratus_,\r\n_cumulo-stratus_, and _nimbus_. In passing, it may be of interest to\r\nnote that, a few years after Howard's classification was published,\r\nan attempt was made by one Thomas Forster to introduce \"popular\"\r\nequivalents of these terms. Forster proposed to call cirrus \"curlcloud,\"\r\ncumulus \"stackencloud,\" stratus \"fallcloud,\" etc. In other words,\r\nhe assumed that because Howard's names were Latin in form they\r\nwere unsuitable for use by the layman, and therefore needed to be\r\nsupplemented by English names--although the proposed substitutes were,\r\non the whole, somewhat longer and more difficult to pronounce than the\r\noriginals! A parallel undertaking would be an attempt to discourage\r\nthe public from calling the wind-flower \"anemone,\" or virgin's bower\r\n\"clematis.\" Forster's superfluous names have never taken root in our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe highest clouds--cirrus and cirro-stratus--are feathery in\r\nappearance, and consist of minute crystals of ice. Their altitude above\r\nsea-level averages about five miles, but is frequently much greater\r\nthan this. All other clouds are composed of little drops of water--not\r\nhollow vesicles of water, as was once supposed. Neither crystals nor\r\ndrops actually \"float\" in the air. They are constantly falling with\r\nrespect to the air around them, though, as the air itself often has an\r\nupward movement, the cloud particles are not always falling with\r\nreference to the earth. In any case, their rate of fall depends upon\r\ntheir size, and in the case of the smaller particles is very slow. Under\r\nsome conditions the particles evaporate before reaching the earth, while\r\nunder others they maintain a solid or liquid form and constitute rain or\r\nsnow. A fog is a cloud lying at the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nRainfall is one of the most important elements of climate, chiefly\r\nbecause of its effects upon vegetation. It is measured in terms of the\r\ndepth of water that would lie on the ground if none of it ran off,\r\nsoaked in, or evaporated; and this is, in practice, determined by\r\ncollecting the rain, as it falls, in a suitable receiver, or rain-gauge.\r\nUsually the gauge is so shaped as to magnify the actual depth of\r\nrainfall, in order to facilitate measurement. Snow is measured in two\r\nways; first, as snow, and, second, in terms of its \"water equivalent.\"\r\nThe latter measurement is commonly effected by melting the snow and\r\npouring it into the rain-gauge, where it is measured as rain. By this\r\nexpedient we are enabled to combine measurements of rain and snow, in\r\norder to get the total \"precipitation\" of a place during a given period.\r\n\r\nNature is notoriously partial in her distribution of this valuable\r\nelement over the earth. A region having an average annual rainfall of\r\nless than ten inches is normally a desert, though irrigation or\r\n\"dry-farming\" methods may enable its inhabitants to practice\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest average annual rainfall in the United States (not including\r\nAlaska) is about 136 inches, in Tillamook County, Oregon. The rainiest\r\nmeteorological station in the world is Cherrapunji, India, with an\r\naverage of about 426 inches per annum.[B]\r\n\r\n    [B] This is the latest official record. There are several\r\n        rain-gauges at Cherrapunji, and the average amount of\r\n        rain collected by any one of them varies considerably\r\n        with the length of the record. Hence the widely divergent\r\n        values of the rainfall at this famous station published\r\n        in encyclopaedias and other reference books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OBSERVATORY ON MONTE ROSA]\r\n\r\nTHE OUTPOSTS OF METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\nMonograph Number Four in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expression used in our title seems a fitting one to apply to a\r\nnumber of meteorological observatories and stations maintained for the\r\nbenefit of science in regions remote from the comforts and conveniences\r\nof civilization. Some are on the summits of lofty mountains, the ascent\r\nof which is laborious and even perilous. Others are situated in the\r\nbleak wildernesses of the circumpolar zones. Public attention has all\r\ntoo rarely been called to the heroism and self-sacrifice of the men who\r\nconstitute the staffs of these lonely outposts.\r\n\r\nThe institution shown in our gravure--officially known, in honor of the\r\nDowager Queen of Italy, as the Regina Margherita Observatory--crowns the\r\nsummit of Monte Rosa, on the northern Italian frontier, and is 14,960\r\nfeet above sea-level. It is devoted not only to meteorological\r\ninvestigations, but to studies of the physiological effects of great\r\naltitudes and various other researches, and is open to the _savants_ of\r\nall nationalities who are courageous enough to scale the second highest\r\nsummit of the Alps. It is habitable for only about two months; viz.,\r\nfrom the middle of July to the middle of September. Each year a\r\ntemporary telephone line is constructed connecting the observatory with\r\nthe plains of Italy. This is the highest telephone line in the world,\r\nand its installation is an arduous undertaking. A permanent line is\r\nimpossible, on account of the shifting of the glaciers and snowfields on\r\nwhich the poles must be erected.\r\n\r\nThere is also a meteorological observatory on Mont Blanc, but it is not\r\nat the summit and is not quite so high as that on Monte Rosa. The solar\r\nobservatory which once stood at the very top of Mont Blanc no longer\r\nexists. The United States Signal Service (now the Weather Bureau)\r\nformerly maintained observatories on Pike's Peak (14,134 feet) and Mount\r\nWashington (6,280 feet). The loftiest of meteorological stations was,\r\nhowever, that formerly operated by Harvard College Observatory on the\r\nsummit of El Misti, Peru (19,200 feet).\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the United States Weather Bureau maintained a\r\nlarge and important observatory at Mount Weather, at the crest of the\r\nBlue Ridge, near Bluemont, Virginia. In the Old World one of the most\r\nfamous of mountain meteorological observatories was that which stood on\r\nBen Nevis (4,406), the highest summit in the British Isles. This was\r\nclosed in 1904.\r\n\r\nIf the conditions of life at these high-level stations are such as to\r\nrepel any but the ardent lover of science, the same is true in even\r\ngreater measure of those endured by the little band of meteorologists\r\nwho man the observatory maintained by the government of Argentina at\r\nLaurie Island, in the South Orkneys, on the verge of the Antarctic.\r\nEvery year a party of four is sent out from Buenos Aires to spend a year\r\nof exile in this inhospitable spot, which is generally ice-bound, and\r\nhas not even wireless communication with the rest of the world. This\r\nstation has been in operation since 1904. The staff, which is changed\r\neach year, has embraced men of several nationalities--Scotch, American\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nFar within the Arctic Circle two meteorological observatories are\r\nmaintained in Spitsbergen; but these are, at least, connected with the\r\nworld by radiotelegraphy.\r\n\r\nIf the hopes of explorer Peary are accomplished, an observatory will,\r\none of these days, be established at the South Pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAUNCHING A METEOROLOGICAL KITE]\r\n\r\nTHE AIR ABOVE US\r\n\r\nMonograph Number Five in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorologists are not content to limit their investigations to the\r\nstratum of air lying close to the earth's surface. Even before the\r\ndemands of the aeronaut for information concerning the structure and\r\nphenomena of the atmosphere far overhead became pressing, many efforts\r\nhad been made to secure such information, in view of its important\r\nbearing upon many scientific problems. As long ago as the year 1784 a\r\nballoonist, equipped with various meteorological instruments, made an\r\nascent from London and brought back an interesting series of\r\nobservations, which were communicated to the Royal Society. For more\r\nthan a century the manned balloon was the principal means of sounding\r\nthe upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNowadays, as a rule, the meteorologist, instead of going aloft in\r\nperson, sends up a kite or a balloon to which are attached automatically\r\nregistering instruments. When the aerial vehicle returns to earth its\r\nrecord shows in detail the conditions encountered during the journey.\r\n\r\nEverybody remembers how Franklin brought lightning from the clouds; but\r\nit is a far cry from the simple apparatus that served Franklin's purpose\r\nto the \"box kite\" of modern meteorology. Science has perfected the kite\r\nalmost beyond recognition. It has been shorn of that crucial feature of\r\nthe schoolboy article, the tail. Even the kite \"string\" has become\r\nseveral miles of steel piano wire, wound around the drum of a\r\npower-driven winch, with elaborate apparatus for recording the force of\r\nthe pull, and the angles of azimuth and altitude.\r\n\r\nCaptive balloons are sometimes used for similar investigations. When,\r\nhowever, it is desired to attain great altitudes the meteorologist has\r\nrecourse to the so-called \"sounding-balloon,\" which is not tethered to\r\nthe earth. This is usually made of india-rubber, and when launched is\r\ninflated to less than its full capacity. As it rises to regions of\r\ndiminished air pressure it gradually expands, and finally bursts at an\r\nelevation approximately determined in advance. A linen cap, serving as a\r\nparachute, or sometimes an auxiliary balloon which does not burst,\r\nserves to waft the apparatus, with its delicate self-registering\r\ninstruments, gently to the ground. This commonly happens many\r\nmiles--sometimes two hundred or more--from the place of ascent. Attached\r\nto the apparatus is a ticket offering the finder a reward for its\r\nreturn, and giving instructions as to packing and shipping. Sooner or\r\nlater it usually comes back; though often months after it falls. Indeed,\r\nthe large percentage of records recovered, even in sparsely settled\r\ncountries, is not the least remarkable feature of this novel method of\r\nresearch. The instruments attached to sounding-balloons register the\r\ntemperature of the air, the barometric pressure, and sometimes the\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\nBy means of the sounding-balloon the air is explored to heights of\r\ntwenty miles and more! The records obtained by means of these balloons\r\nhave, within the past fifteen years, completely revolutionized our ideas\r\nconcerning the upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\nStill another device employed by meteorologists is the pilot-balloon.\r\nThis is also a free balloon, but carries no meteorological instruments.\r\nIts motion in the air is followed by means of a theodolite, and it\r\nserves to show the speed and direction of the wind at different levels.\r\nDuring the winter of 1912-13 a pilot-balloon sent up from Godhavn,\r\nGreenland, by a Danish exploring expedition reached the unprecedented\r\naltitude of more than 24 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EFFECTS OF SNOW AND ICE--THE CAMPUS, PRINCETON\r\nUNIVERSITY]\r\n\r\nOUR WINTERS\r\n\r\nMonograph Number Six in The Mentor Reading Course\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1781 Thomas Jefferson wrote in his \"Notes on Virginia\":\r\n\"A change of climate is taking place very sensibly. *** Snows are less\r\nfrequent and less deep. They do not often lie below the mountains\r\nmore than one, two or three days, and very rarely a week. The snows\r\nare remembered to have been formerly frequent, deep, and of long\r\ncontinuance. The elderly inform me that the earth used to be covered\r\nwith snow about three months in every year.\"\r\n\r\nProbably long before the white man came to America the patriarchs of the\r\nIndian tribes regaled the young men and maidens gathered about the\r\ncampfire with reminiscences of the deep snows that prevailed in a\r\nprevious generation.\r\n\r\nIn short the \"old-fashioned winter\" is a _perennial myth_, perpetuated\r\nby a familiar process of self-delusion! The occasional periods of\r\nabundant snow make a more lasting impression upon our minds than the\r\nlong intervals in which this element was scarce or lacking. The\r\nresulting misconception is promptly dissipated when we consult the\r\nweather records, which, in some parts of the country, extend back more\r\nthan a century, and prove that there has been no actual change in the\r\nclimate within the period they embrace.\r\n\r\nOf course the erroneous idea is, in some cases, due to the fact that\r\none's childhood was spent in a part of the country in which the snowfall\r\nis normally heavier than in that where one has recently lived. The\r\naverage yearly snowfall over the New England States, New York, and the\r\nborders of the Great Lakes is from 50 to 100 inches, and upward. Over\r\nthe North Central States it is much less. In the Southern tier of States\r\nand along almost the whole of our Pacific coast snow is a rarity. The\r\nheaviest snowfall in this country probably occurs in the high Sierra\r\nNevada of California, near the border of Nevada. In some places in these\r\nmountains more than 40 feet of snow falls in an average winter, while\r\nmore than 65 feet has been recorded in extreme cases. Here it is a\r\ncommon occurrence for one-story houses to be buried, to the eaves, or\r\nabove. The Southern Pacific Railway, which intersects this region, has\r\nbuilt 32 miles of snowsheds, at a cost of $42,000 a mile over single\r\ntrack and $65,000 a mile over double track. In an average year $150,000\r\nis spent on these sheds in upkeep and renewals. Flat-roofed houses are\r\nunknown in this vicinity; all roofs are gabled at a sharp angle to shed\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\nA picturesque feature of our American winters is the \"ice storm,\" so\r\nenthusiastically described by Mark Twain:\r\n\r\n\"... When a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the\r\ntop--ice that is as bright and clear as crystal; when every bough and\r\ntwig is strung with ice-beads, frozen dew-drops, and the whole tree\r\nsparkles cold and white, like the Shah of Persia's diamond plume.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the artist's view of the phenomenon; but, alas! these same ice\r\nstorms cause endless inconvenience and heavy expense every winter to the\r\nelectrical industries, by breaking wires.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 10, SERIAL No. 110\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mentor: The Weather, by Charles Fitzhugh Talman",
