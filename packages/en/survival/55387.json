Dr. Samuel B. Rowbotham\r\nfinished his earthly labours, in England, the country of his birth,\r\nDecember 23, 1884, at the age of 89. He was, certainly, one of the\r\nmost gifted of men: and though his labours as a public lecturer were\r\nconfined within the limits of the British Islands his published work\r\nis known all over the world and is destined to live and be republished\r\nwhen books on the now popular system of philosophy will be considered\r\nin no other light than as bundles of waste paper. For several years\r\ndid \"Parallax\" spread a knowledge of the facts which form the basis\r\nof his system without the slightest recognition from the newspaper\r\npress until, in January, 1849, the people were informed by the \"Wilts\r\nIndependent\" that lectures had been delivered by \"a gentleman adopting\r\nthe name of 'Parallax,' to prove modern astronomy unreasonable and\r\ncontradictory,\" that \"great skill\" was shown by the lecturer, and that\r\nhe proved himself to be \"thoroughly acquainted with the subject in all\r\nits bearings.\" Such was the beginning--the end will not be so easily\r\ndescribed. The Truth will always find advocates--men who care not\r\na snap of their fingers for the mere opinion of the world, whatever\r\nform it may take, whilst they know that they are the masters of the\r\nsituation and that Reason is King! In 1867, \"Parallax\" was described as\r\n\"a paragon of courtesy, good temper, and masterly skill in debate.\" The\r\nauthor of the following hastily-gotten-up pages is proud of having\r\nspent many a pleasant hour in the company of Samuel Birley Rowbotham.\r\n\r\nA complete sketch of the \"Zetetic Philosophy\" is impossible in a small\r\npamphlet; and many things necessarily remain unsaid which, perhaps,\r\nshould have been touched upon, but which would to some extent have\r\ninterfered with the plan laid down--the bringing together, in a concise\r\nform, \"One Hundred Proofs that the Earth is not a Globe.\" Much may\r\nbe gathered, indirectly, from the arguments in these pages, as to the\r\nreal nature of the Earth on which we live and of the heavenly bodies\r\nwhich were created FOR US. The reader is requested to be patient in\r\nthis matter and not expect a whole flood of light to burst in upon him\r\nat once, through the dense clouds of opposition and prejudice which\r\nhang all around. Old ideas have to be gotten rid of, by some people,\r\nbefore they can entertain the new; and this will especially be the case\r\nin the matter of the Sun, about which we are taught, by Mr. Proctor,\r\nas follows: \"The globe of the Sun is so much larger than that of the\r\nEarth that no less than 1,250,000 globes as large as the Earth would\r\nbe wanted to make up together a globe as large as the Sun.\" Whereas,\r\nwe know that, as it is demonstrated that the Sun moves round over the\r\nEarth, its size is proportionately less. We can then easily understand\r\nthat Day and Night, and the Seasons are brought about by his daily\r\ncircuits round in a course concentric with the North, diminishing\r\nin their extent to the end of June, and increasing until the end of\r\nDecember, the equatorial region being the area covered by the Sun's\r\nmean motion. If, then, these pages serve but to arouse the spirit of\r\nenquiry, the author will be satisfied. The right hand of fellowship\r\nin this good work is extended, in turn, to Mr. J. Lindgren, 90 South\r\nFirst Street, Brooklyn, E. D., N. Y., Mr. M. C. Flanders, lecturer,\r\nKendall, Orleans County, N. Y., and to Mr. John Hampden, editor of\r\n\"Parallax\" (a new journal), Cosmos House, Balham, Surrey, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ONE HUNDRED PROOFS\r\n                                  THAT\r\n                         EARTH IS NOT A GLOBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf man uses the senses which God has given him, he gains knowledge;\r\nif he uses them not, he remains ignorant. Mr. R. A. Proctor, who has\r\nbeen called \"the greatest astronomer of the age,\" says: \"The Earth on\r\nwhich we live and move seems to be flat.\" Now, he does not mean that it\r\nseems to be flat to the man who shuts his eyes in the face of nature,\r\nor, who is not in the full possession of his senses: no, but to the\r\naverage, common sense, wide-awake, thinking man. He continues: \"that\r\nis, though there are hills and valleys on its surface, yet it seems to\r\nextend on all sides in one and the same general level.\" Again, he says:\r\n\"There seems nothing to prevent us from travelling as far as we please\r\nin any direction towards the circle all round us, called the horizon,\r\nwhere the sky seems to meet the level of the Earth.\" \"The level of the\r\nEarth!\" Mr. Proctor knows right well what he is talking about, for the\r\nbook from which we take his words, \"Lessons in Elementary Astronomy,\"\r\nwas written, he tells us, \"to guard the beginner against the captious\r\nobjections which have from time to time been urged against accepted\r\nastronomical theories.\" The things which are to be defended, then,\r\nare these \"accepted astronomical theories!\" It is not truth that is to\r\nbe defended against the assaults of error--Oh, no: simply \"theories,\"\r\nright or wrong, because they have been \"accepted!\" Accepted! Why,\r\nthey have been accepted because it was not thought to be worth while\r\nto look at them. Sir John Herschel says: \"We shall take for granted,\r\nfrom the outset, the Copernican system of the world.\" He did not\r\ncare whether it was the right system or a wrong one, or he would\r\nnot have done that: he would have looked into it. But, forsooth, the\r\ntheories are accepted, and, of course, the men who have accepted them\r\nare the men who will naturally defend them if they can. So, Richard\r\nA. Proctor tries his hand; and we shall see how it fails him. His book\r\nwas published without any date to it at all. But there is internal\r\nevidence which will fix that matter closely enough. We read of the\r\ncarrying out of the experiments of the celebrated scientist, Alfred\r\nR. Wallace, to prove the \"convexity\" of the surface of standing water,\r\nwhich experiments were conducted in March, 1870, for the purpose\r\nof winning Five Hundred Pounds from John Hampden, Esq., of Swindon,\r\nEngland, who had wagered that sum upon the conviction that the said\r\nsurface is always a level one. Mr. Proctor says: \"The experiment\r\nwas lately tried in a very amusing way.\" In or about the year 1870,\r\nthen, Mr. Proctor wrote his book; and, instead of being ignorant of\r\nthe details of the experiment, he knew all about them. And whether the\r\n\"amusing\" part of the business was the fact that Mr. Wallace wrongfully\r\nclaimed the five-hundred pounds and got it, or that Mr. Hampden was\r\nthe victim of the false claim, it is hard to say. The \"way\" in which\r\nthe experiment was carried out is, to all intents and purposes, just\r\nthe way in which Mr. Proctor states that it \"can be tried.\" He says,\r\nhowever, that the distance involved in the experiment \"should be three\r\nor four miles.\" Now, Mr. Wallace took up six miles in his experiment,\r\nand was unable to prove that there is any \"curvature,\" though he\r\nclaimed the money and got it; surely it would be \"amusing\" for anyone\r\nto expect to be able to show the \"curvature of the earth\" in three\r\nor four miles, as Mr. Proctor suggests! Nay, it is ridiculous. But\r\n\"the greatest astronomer of the age\" says the thing can be done! And\r\nhe gives a diagram: \"Showing how the roundness of the Earth can be\r\nproved by means of three boats on a large sheet of water.\" (Three\r\nor four miles.) But, though the accepted astronomical theories be\r\nscattered to the winds, we charge Mr. Proctor either that he has\r\nnever made the experiment with the three boats, or, that, if he has,\r\nthe experiment did NOT prove what he says it will. Accepted theories,\r\nindeed! Are they to be bolstered up with absurdity and falsehood? Why,\r\nif it were possible to show the two ends of a four-mile stretch of\r\nwater to be on a level, with the centre portion of that water bulged\r\nup, the surface of the Earth would be a series of four-mile curves!\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Proctor says: \"We can set three boats in a line on the water,\r\nas at A, B, and C, (Fig. 7). Then, if equal masts are placed in\r\nthese boats, and we place a telescope, as shown, so that when we\r\nlook through it we see the tops of the masts of A and C, we find\r\nthe top of the mast B is above the line of sight.\" Now, here is the\r\npoint: Mr. Proctor either knows or he ought to know that we shall\r\nNOT find anything of the sort! If he has ever tried the experiment,\r\nhe knows that the three masts will range in a straight line, just as\r\ncommon sense tells us they will. If he has not tried the experiment,\r\nhe should have tried it, or have paid attention to the details of\r\nexperiments by those who have tried similar ones a score of times and\r\nagain. Mr. Proctor may take either horn of the dilemma he pleases: he\r\nis just as wrong as a man can be, either way. He mentions no names,\r\nbut he says: \"A person had written a book, in which he said that he\r\nhad tried such an experiment as the above, and had found that the\r\nsurface of the water was not curved.\" That person was \"Parallax,\" the\r\nfounder of the Zetetic Philosophy. He continues: \"Another person seems\r\nto have believed the first, and became so certain that the Earth is\r\nflat as to wager a large sum of money that if three boats were placed\r\nas in Fig. 7, the middle one would not be above the line joining the\r\ntwo others.\" That person was John Hampden. And, says Mr. Proctor,\r\n\"Unfortunately for him, some one who had more sense agreed to take\r\nhis wager, and, of course, won his money.\" Now, the \"some one who\r\nhad more sense\" was Mr. Wallace. And, says Proctor, in continuation:\r\n\"He [Hampden?] was rather angry; and it is a strange thing that he\r\nwas not angry with himself for being so foolish, or with the person\r\nwho said he had tried the experiment (and so led him astray), but with\r\nthe person who had won his money!\" Here, then, we see that Mr. Proctor\r\nknows better than to say that the experiments conducted by \"Parallax\"\r\nwere things of the imagination only, or that a wrong account had been\r\ngiven of them; and it would be well if he knew better than to try to\r\nmake his readers believe that either one or the other of these things\r\nis the fact: But, there is the Old Bedford Canal now; and there are ten\r\nthousand places where the experiment may be tried! Who, then, are the\r\n\"foolish\" people: those who \"believe\" the record of experiments made\r\nby searchers after Truth, or those who shut their eyes to them, throw\r\na doubt upon the record, charge the conductors of the experiments\r\nwith dishonesty, never conduct similar experiments themselves, and\r\ndeclare the result of such experiments to be so and so, when the\r\ndeclaration can be proved to be false by any man, with a telescope,\r\nin twenty-four hours?\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor:--The sphericity of the Earth CANNOT be proved in the\r\nway in which you tell us it \"can\" be! We tell you to take back\r\nyour words and remodel them on the basis of Truth. Such careless\r\nmisrepresentations of facts are a disgrace to science--they are the\r\ndisgrace of theoretical science to-day! Mr. Blackie, in his work on\r\n\"Self Culture,\" says: \"All flimsy, shallow, and superficial work,\r\nin fact, is a lie, of which a man ought to be ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Earth is an extended plane, stretched out in all directions\r\naway from the central North, over which hangs, for ever, the North\r\nStar, is a fact which all the falsehoods that can be brought to bear\r\nupon it with their dead weight will never overthrow: it is God's Truth\r\nthe face of which, however, man has the power to smirch all over\r\nwith his unclean hands. Mr. Proctor says: \"We learn from astronomy\r\nthat all these ideas, natural though they seem, are mistaken.\" Man's\r\nnatural ideas and conclusions and experimental results are, then, to\r\nbe overthrown by--what! By \"astronomy?\" By a thing without a soul--a\r\nmere theoretical abstraction, the outcome of the dreamer? Never! The\r\ngreatest astronomer of the age is not the man, even, who can so much\r\nas attempt to manage the business. \"We find,\" says Mr. Proctor,\r\n\"that the Earth is not flat, but a globe; not fixed, but in very\r\nrapid motion; not much larger than the moon, and far smaller than\r\nthe Sun and the greater number of the stars.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, then, Mr. Proctor, tell us HOW you find that the Earth is\r\nnot flat, but a globe! It does not matter that \"we find\" it so\r\nput down in that conglomeration of suppositions which you seek to\r\ndefend: the question is, What is the evidence of it?--where can it\r\nbe obtained? \"The Earth on which we live and move seems to be flat,\"\r\nyou tell us: where, then, is the mistake? If the Earth seem to be what\r\nit is not, how are we to trust our senses? And if it is said that we\r\ncannot do so, are we to believe it, and consent to be put down lower\r\nthan the brutes? No, sir: we challenge you, as we have done many times\r\nbefore, to produce the slightest evidence of the Earth's rotundity,\r\nfrom the world of facts around you. You have given to us the statement\r\nwe have quoted, and we have the right to demand a proof; and if this\r\nis not forthcoming, we have before us the duty of denouncing the\r\nabsurd dogma as worse than an absurdity--as a FRAUD--and as a fraud\r\nthat flies in the face of divine revelation! Well, then, Mr. Proctor,\r\nin demanding a proof of the Earth's rotundity (or the frank admission\r\nof your errors), we are tempted to taunt you as we tell you that it\r\nis utterly out of your power to produce one; and we tell you that you\r\ndo not dare even to lift up your finger to point us to the so-called\r\nproofs in the school-books of the day, for you know the measure of\r\nabsurdity of which they are composed, and how disgraceful it is to\r\nallow them to remain as false guides of the youthful mind!\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor: we charge you that, whilst you teach the theory of\r\nthe Earth's rotundity and mobility, you KNOW that it is a plane;\r\nand here is the ground of the charge. In page 7, in your book, you\r\ngive a diagram of the \"surface on which we live,\" and the \"supposed\r\nglobe\"--the supposed \"hollow globe\"--of the heavens, arched over\r\nthe said surface. Now, Mr. Proctor, you picture the surface on which\r\nwe live in exact accordance with your verbal description. And what\r\nis that description? We shall scarcely be believed when we say that\r\nwe give it just as it stands: \"The level of the surface on which we\r\nlive.\" And, that there may be no mistake about the meaning of the word\r\n\"level,\" we remind you that your diagram proves that the level that\r\nyou mean is the level of the mechanic, a plane surface, and not the\r\n\"level\" of the astronomer, which is a convex surface! In short, your\r\ndescription of the Earth is exactly what you say it \"seems to be,\"\r\nand, yet, what you say it is not: the very aim of your book being to\r\nsay so! And we call this the prostitution of the printing press. And\r\nit is all the evidence that is necessary to bring the charge home\r\nto you, since the words and the diagram are in page 7 of your own\r\nbook. You know, then, that Earth is a Plane--and so do we.\r\n\r\nNow for the evidence of this grand fact, that other people may know\r\nit as well as you: remembering, from first to last, that you have\r\nnot dared to bring forward a single item from the mass of evidence\r\nwhich is to be found in the \"Zetetic Philosophy,\" by \"Parallax,\"\r\na work the influence of which it was the avowed object of your own\r\nbook to crush!--except that of the three boats, an experiment which\r\nyou have never tried, and the result of which has never been known,\r\nby anyone who has tried it, to be as you say it is!\r\n\r\n1. The aeronaut can see for himself that Earth is a Plane. The\r\nappearance presented to him, even at the highest elevation he has\r\never attained, is that of a concave surface--this being exactly what\r\nis to be expected of a surface that is truly level, since it is the\r\nnature of level surfaces to appear to rise to a level with the eye\r\nof the observer. This is ocular demonstration and proof that Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever experiments have been tried on the surface of standing\r\nwater, this surface has always been found to be level. If the Earth\r\nwere a globe, the surface of all standing water would be convex. This\r\nis an experimental proof that Earth is not a globe,\r\n\r\n3. Surveyors' operations in the construction of railroads, tunnels,\r\nor canals are conducted without the slightest \"allowance\" being made\r\nfor \"curvature,\" although it is taught that this so-called allowance\r\nis absolutely necessary! This is a cutting proof that Earth is not\r\na globe.\r\n\r\n4. There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the\r\nlevel of the sea without falling more than a few feet--notably, the\r\nNile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse\r\nof this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's\r\n\"convexity.\" It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not\r\na globe.\r\n\r\n5. The lights which are exhibited in lighthouses are seen by\r\nnavigators at distances at which, according to the scale of the\r\nsupposed \"curvature\" given by astronomers, they ought to be many\r\nhundreds of feet, in some cases, down below the line of sight! For\r\ninstance: the light at Cape Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40\r\nmiles) that, according to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet\r\nhigher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to\r\nbe visible! This is a conclusive proof that there is no \"curvature,\"\r\non the surface of the sea--\"the level of the sea,\"--ridiculous though\r\nit is to be under the necessity of proving it at all: but it is,\r\nnevertheless, a conclusive proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n6. If we stand on the sands of the sea-shore and watch a ship\r\napproach us, we shall find that she will apparently \"rise\"--to the\r\nextent of her own height, nothing more. If we stand upon an eminence,\r\nthe same law operates still; and it is but the law of perspective,\r\nwhich causes objects, as they approach us, to appear to increase in\r\nsize until we see them, close to us, the size they are in fact. That\r\nthere is no other \"rise\" than the one spoken of is plain from the\r\nfact that, no matter how high we ascend above the level of the sea,\r\nthe horizon rises on and still on as we rise, so that it is always\r\non a level with the eye, though it be two-hundred miles away, as seen\r\nby Mr. J. Glaisher, of England, from Mr. Coxwell's balloon. So that a\r\nship five miles away may be imagined to be \"coming up\" the imaginary\r\ndownward curve of the Earth's surface, but if we merely ascend a hill\r\nsuch as Federal Hill, Baltimore, we may see twenty-five miles away,\r\non a level with the eye--that is, twenty miles level distance beyond\r\nthe ship that we vainly imagined to be \"rounding the curve,\" and\r\n\"coming up!\" This is a plain proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n7. If we take a trip down the Chesapeake Bay, in the day-time,\r\nwe may see for ourselves the utter fallacy of the idea that when a\r\nvessel appears \"hull down,\" as it is called, it is because the hull is\r\n\"behind the water:\" for, vessels have been seen, and may often be seen\r\nagain, presenting the appearance spoken of, and away--far away--beyond\r\nthose vessels, and, at the same moment, the level shore line, with its\r\naccompanying complement of tall trees, towering up, in perspective,\r\nover the heads of the \"hull-down\" ships! Since, then, the idea will not\r\nstand its ground when the facts rise up against it, and it is a piece\r\nof the popular theory, the theory is a contemptible piece of business,\r\nand we may easily wring from it a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n8. If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very\r\nbest--because the truest--thing for the navigator to take to sea\r\nwith him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as\r\na guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty! This is\r\na proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n9. As mariners take to sea with them charts constructed as though\r\nthe sea were a level surface, however these charts may err as to\r\nthe true form of this level surface taken as a whole, it is clear,\r\nas they find them answer their purpose tolerably well--and only\r\ntolerably well, for many ships are wrecked owing to the error of\r\nwhich we speak--that the surface of the sea is as it is taken to be,\r\nwhether the captain of the ship \"supposes\" the Earth to be a globe\r\nor anything else. Thus, then, we draw, from the common system of\r\n\"plane sailing,\" a practical proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n10. That the mariners' compass points north and south at the same time\r\nis a fact as indisputable as that two and two makes four; but that\r\nthis would be impossible if the thing were placed on a globe with\r\n\"north\" and \"south\" at the centre of opposite hemispheres is a fact\r\nthat does not figure in the school-books, though very easily seen:\r\nand it requires no lengthy train of reasoning to bring out of it a\r\npointed proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n11. As the mariners' compass points north and south at one time,\r\nand as the North, to which it is attracted, is that part of the Earth\r\nsituate where the North Star is in the zenith, it follows that there\r\nis no south \"point\" or \"pole\" but that, while the centre is North,\r\na vast circumference must be South in its whole extent. This is a\r\nproof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n12. As we have seen that there is, really, no south point (or pole)\r\nbut an infinity of points forming, together, a vast circumference--the\r\nboundary of the known world, with its battlements of icebergs which bid\r\ndefiance to man's onward course in a southerly direction--so there can\r\nbe no east or west \"points,\" just as there is no \"yesterday,\" and no\r\n\"to-morrow.\" In fact, as there is one point that is fixed (the North),\r\nit is impossible for any other point to be fixed likewise. East and\r\nwest are, therefore, merely directions at right angles with a north\r\nand south line: and as the south point of the compass shifts round to\r\nall parts of the circular boundary, (as it may be carried round the\r\ncentral North), so the directions east and west, crossing this line,\r\ncontinued, form a circle, at any latitude. A westerly circumnavigation,\r\ntherefore, is a going round with the North Star continually on the\r\nright hand, and an easterly circumnavigation is performed only when\r\nthe reverse condition of things is maintained, the North Star being\r\non the left hand as the journey is made. These facts, taken together,\r\nform a beautiful proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n13. As the mariners' compass points north and south at one and the\r\nsame time, and a meridian is a north and south line, it follows that\r\nmeridians can be no other than straight lines. But, since all meridians\r\non a globe are semicircles, it is an incontrovertible proof that the\r\nEarth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n14. \"Parallels of latitude\" only--of all imaginary lines on the\r\nsurface of the Earth--are circles, which increase, progressively,\r\nfrom the northern centre to the southern circumference. The mariner's\r\ncourse in the direction of any one of these concentric circles is his\r\nlongitude, the degrees of which INCREASE to such an extent beyond the\r\nequator (going southwards) that hundreds of vessels have been wrecked\r\nbecause of the false idea created by the untruthfulness of the charts\r\nand the globular theory together, causing the sailor to be continually\r\ngetting out of his reckoning. With a map of the Earth in its true form\r\nall difficulty is done away with, and ships may be conducted anywhere\r\nwith perfect safety. This, then, is a very important practical proof\r\nthat the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n15. The idea that, instead of sailing horizontally round the Earth,\r\nships are taken down one side of a globe, then underneath, and\r\nare brought up on the other side to get home again, is, except\r\nas a mere dream, impossible and absurd! And, since there are\r\nneither impossibilities nor absurdities in the simple matter of\r\ncircumnavigation, it stands, without argument, a proof that the Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n16. If the Earth were a globe, the distance round its surface at,\r\nsay, 45 \"degrees\" south latitude, could not possibly be any greater\r\nthan it is at the same latitude north; but, since it is found by\r\nnavigators to be twice the distance--to say the least of it--or,\r\ndouble the distance it ought to be according to the globular theory,\r\nit is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n17. Human beings require a surface on which to live that, in its\r\ngeneral character, shall be LEVEL; and since the Omniscient Creator\r\nmust have been perfectly acquainted with the requirements of His\r\ncreatures, it follows that, being an All-wise Creator, He has met them\r\nthoroughly. This is a theological proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n18. The best possessions of man are his senses; and, when he uses\r\nthem all, he will not be deceived in his survey of nature. It is\r\nonly when some one faculty or other is neglected or abused that\r\nhe is deluded. Every man in full command of his senses knows that\r\na level surface is a flat or horizontal one; but astronomers tell\r\nus that the true level is the curved surface of a globe! They know\r\nthat man requires a level surface on which to live, so they give him\r\none in name which is not one in fact! Since this is the best that\r\nastronomers, with their theoretical science, can do for their fellow\r\ncreatures--deceive them--it is clear that things are not as they say\r\nthey are; and, in short, it is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n19. Every man in his senses goes the most reasonable way to work to\r\ndo a thing. Now, astronomers (one after another--following a leader),\r\nwhile they are telling us that Earth is a globe, are cutting off the\r\nupper half of this supposititious globe in their books, and, in this\r\nway, forming the level surface on which they describe man as living and\r\nmoving! Now, if the Earth were really a globe, this would be just the\r\nmost unreasonable and suicidal mode of endeavoring to show it. So that,\r\nunless theoretical astronomers are all out of their senses together,\r\nit is, clearly, a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n20. The common sense of man tells him--if nothing else told him--that\r\nthere is an \"up\" and a \"down\" in nature, even as regards the heavens\r\nand the earth; but the theory of modern astronomers necessitates the\r\nconclusion that there is not: therefore, the theory of the astronomers\r\nis opposed to common sense--yes, and to inspiration--and this is a\r\ncommon sense proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n21. Man's experience tells him that he is not constructed like the\r\nflies that can live and move upon the ceiling of a room with as much\r\nsafety as on the floor: and since the modern theory of a planetary\r\nearth necessitates a crowd of theories to keep company with it,\r\nand one of them is that men are really bound to the earth by a force\r\nwhich fastens them to it \"like needles round a spherical lodestone,\"\r\na theory perfectly outrageous and opposed to all human experience,\r\nit follows that, unless we can trample upon common sense and ignore\r\nthe teachings of experience, we have an evident proof that the Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n22. God's Truth never--no, never--requires a falsehood to help it\r\nalong. Mr. Proctor, in his \"Lessons,\" says: Men \"have been able to go\r\nround and round the Earth in several directions.\" Now, in this case,\r\nthe word \"several\" will imply more than two, unquestionably: whereas,\r\nit is utterly impossible to circumnavigate the Earth in any other\r\nthan an easterly or a westerly direction; and the fact is perfectly\r\nconsistent and clear in its relation to Earth as a Plane. Now, since\r\nastronomers would not be so foolish as to damage a good cause by\r\nmisrepresentation, it is presumptive evidence that their cause is a\r\nbad one, and--a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n23. If astronomical works be searched through and through, there\r\nwill not be found a single instance of a bold, unhesitating, or manly\r\nstatement respecting a proof of the Earth's \"rotundity.\" Proctor speaks\r\nof \"proofs which serve to show ... that the Earth is not flat,\" and\r\nsays that man \"finds reason to think that the Earth is not flat,\"\r\nand speaks of certain matters being \"explained by supposing\" that\r\nthe Earth is a globe; and says that people have \"assured themselves\r\nthat it is a globe;\" but he says, also, that there is a \"most complete\r\nproof that the Earth is a globe:\" just as though anything in the world\r\ncould possibly be wanted but a proof--a proof that proves and settles\r\nthe whole question. This, however, all the money in the United States\r\nTreasury would not buy; and, unless the astronomers are all so rich\r\nthat they don't want the cash, it is a sterling proof that the Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n24. When a man speaks of a \"most complete\" thing amongst several\r\nother things which claim to be what that thing is, it is evident\r\nthat they must fall short of something which the \"most complete\"\r\nthing possesses. And when it is known that the \"most complete\" thing\r\nis an entire failure, it is plain that the others, all and sundry,\r\nare worthless. Proctor's \"most complete proof that the Earth is a\r\nglobe\" lies in what he calls \"the fact\" that distances from place\r\nto place agree with calculation. But, since the distance round the\r\nEarth at 45 \"degrees\" south of the equator is twice the distance it\r\nwould be on a globe, it follows that what the greatest astronomer of\r\nthe age calls \"a fact\" is NOT a fact; that his \"most complete proof\"\r\nis a most complete failure; and that he might as well have told us,\r\nat once, that he has NO PROOF to give us at all. Now, since, if the\r\nEarth be a globe, there would, necessarily, be piles of proofs of\r\nit all round us, it follows that when astronomers, with all their\r\ningenuity, are utterly unable to point one out--to say nothing about\r\npicking one up--that they give us a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n25. The surveyor's plans in relation to the laying of the first\r\nAtlantic Telegraph cable, show that in 1665 miles--from Valentia,\r\nIreland, to St. John's, Newfoundland--the surface of the Atlantic\r\nOcean is a LEVEL surface--not the astronomers' \"level,\" either! The\r\nauthoritative drawings, published at the time, are a standing evidence\r\nof the fact, and form a practical proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n26. If the Earth were a globe, it would, if we take Valentia to\r\nbe the place of departure, curvate downwards, in the 1665 miles\r\nacross the Atlantic to Newfoundland, according to the astronomers'\r\nown tables, more than three-hundred miles; but, as the surface of\r\nthe Atlantic does not do so--the fact of its levelness having been\r\nclearly demonstrated by Telegraph Cable surveyors,--it follows that\r\nwe have a grand proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n27. Astronomers, in their consideration of the supposed \"curvature\"\r\nof the Earth, have carefully avoided the taking of that view of\r\nthe question which--if anything were needed to do so--would show\r\nits utter absurdity. It is this:--If, instead of taking our ideal\r\npoint of departure to be at Valentia, we consider ourselves at\r\nSt. John's, the 1665 miles of water between us and Valentia would\r\njust as well \"curvate\" downwards as it did in the other case! Now,\r\nsince the direction in which the Earth is said to \"curvate\" is\r\ninterchangeable--depending, indeed, upon the position occupied by\r\na man upon its surface--the thing is utterly absurd; and it follows\r\nthat the theory is an outrage, and that the Earth does not \"curvate\"\r\nat all:--an evident proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n28. Astronomers are in the habit of considering two points on the\r\nEarth's surface, without, it seems, any limit as to the distance that\r\nlies between them, as being on a level, and the intervening section,\r\neven though it be an ocean, as a vast \"hill\"--of water! The Atlantic\r\nocean, in taking this view of the matter, would form a \"hill of water\"\r\nmore than a hundred miles high! The idea is simply monstrous, and\r\ncould only be entertained by scientists whose whole business is made\r\nup of materials of the same description: and it certainly requires\r\nno argument to deduce, from such \"science\" as this, a satisfactory\r\nproof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n29. If the Earth were a globe, it would, unquestionably, have the\r\nsame general characteristics--no matter its size--as a small globe\r\nthat may be stood upon the table. As the small globe has top, bottom,\r\nand sides, so must also the large one--no matter how large it be. But,\r\nas the Earth, which is \"supposed\" to be a large globe, has no sides\r\nor bottom as the small globe has, the conclusion is irresistible that\r\nit is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n30. If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above\r\nits surface would have to look downwards at the horizon (if it be\r\npossible to conceive of a horizon at all under such circumstances)\r\neven as astronomical diagrams indicate--at angles varying from ten to\r\nnearly fifty degrees below the \"horizontal\" line of sight! (It is just\r\nas absurd as it would be to be taught that when we look at a man full\r\nin the face we are looking down at his feet!) But, as no observer in\r\nthe clouds, or upon any eminence on the earth, has ever had to do so,\r\nit follows that the diagrams spoken of are imaginary and false; that\r\nthe theory which requires such things to prop it up is equally airy and\r\nuntrue; and that we have a substantial proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n31. If the Earth were a globe, it would certainly have to be as large\r\nas it is said to be--twenty-five thousand miles in circumference. Now,\r\nthe thing which is called a \"proof\" of the Earth's roundness, and\r\nwhich is presented to children at school, is, that if we stand on\r\nthe sea-shore we may see the ships, as they approach us, absolutely\r\n\"coming up,\" and that, as we are able to see the highest parts of\r\nthese ships first, it is because the lower parts are \"behind the\r\nearth's curve.\" Now, since, if this were the case--that is, if the\r\nlower parts of these ships were behind a \"hill of water\" at all--the\r\nsize of the Earth, indicated by such a curve as this, would be so\r\nsmall that it would only be big enough to hold the people of a parish,\r\nif they could get all round it, instead of the nations of the world,\r\nit follows that the idea is preposterous; that the appearance is due\r\nto another and to some reasonable cause; and that, instead of being\r\na proof of the globular form of the Earth, it is a proof that Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n32. It is often said that, if the Earth were flat, we could see all\r\nover it! This is the result of ignorance. If we stand on the level\r\nsurface of a plain or a prairie, and take notice, we shall find that\r\nthe horizon is formed at about three miles all around us: that is,\r\nthe ground appears to rise up until, at that distance, it seems on\r\na level with the eye-line or line of sight. Consequently, objects no\r\nhigher than we stand--say, six feet--and which are at that distance\r\n(three miles), have reached the \"vanishing point,\" and are beyond\r\nthe sphere of our unaided vision. This is the reason why the hull\r\nof a ship disappears (in going away from us) before the sails; and,\r\ninstead of there being about it the faintest shadow of evidence of\r\nthe Earth's rotundity, it is a clear proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n33. If the Earth were a globe, people--except those on the top--would,\r\ncertainly, have to be \"fastened\" to its surface by some means or\r\nother, whether by the \"attraction\" of astronomers or by some other\r\nundiscovered and undiscoverable process! But, as we know that we\r\nsimply walk on its surface without any other aid than that which is\r\nnecessary for locomotion on a plane, it follows that we have, herein,\r\na conclusive proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n34. If the Earth were a globe, there certainly would be--if we could\r\nimagine the thing to be peopled all round--\"antipodes:\" \"people\r\nwho,\" says the dictionary, \"living exactly on the opposite side of\r\nthe globe to ourselves, have their feet opposite to ours:\"--people\r\nwho are hanging heads downwards whilst we are standing heads up! But,\r\nsince the theory allows us to travel to those parts of the Earth where\r\nthe people are said to be heads downwards, and still to fancy ourselves\r\nto be heads upwards and our friends whom we have left behind us to be\r\nheads downwards, it follows that the whole thing is a myth--a dream--a\r\ndelusion--and a snare; and, instead of there being any evidence at\r\nall in this direction to substantiate the popular theory, it is a\r\nplain proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n35. If we examine a true picture of the distant horizon, or the thing\r\nitself, we shall find that it coincides exactly with a perfectly\r\nstraight and level line. Now, since there could be nothing of the\r\nkind on a globe, and we find it to be the case all over the Earth,\r\nit is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n36. If we take a journey down the Chesapeake Bay, by night, we\r\nshall see the \"light\" exhibited at Sharpe's Island for an hour\r\nbefore the steamer gets to it. We may take up a position on the\r\ndeck so that the rail of the vessel's side will be in a line with\r\nthe \"light\" and in the line of sight; and we shall find that in the\r\nwhole journey the light will not vary in the slightest degree in its\r\napparent elevation. But, say that a distance of thirteen miles has been\r\ntraversed, the astronomers' theory of \"curvature\" demands a difference\r\n(one way or the other!) in the apparent elevation of the light, of 112\r\nfeet 8 inches! Since, however, there is not a difference of 112 hair's\r\nbreadths, we have a plain proof that the water of the Chesapeake Bay\r\nis not curved, which is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n37. If the Earth were a globe, there would, very likely, be (for\r\nnobody knows) six months day and six months night at the arctic and\r\nantarctic regions, as astronomers dare to assert there is:--for their\r\ntheory demands it! But, as this fact--the six months day and six months\r\nnight--is nowhere found but in the arctic regions, it agrees perfectly\r\nwith everything else that we know about the Earth as a plane, and,\r\nwhilst it overthrows the \"accepted theory,\" it furnishes a striking\r\nproof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n38. When the Sun crosses the equator, in March, and begins to circle\r\nround the heavens in north latitude, the inhabitants of high northern\r\nlatitudes see him skimming round their horizon and forming the break of\r\ntheir long day, in a horizontal course, not disappearing again for six\r\nmonths, as he rises higher and higher in the heavens whilst he makes\r\nhis twenty-four hour circle until June, when he begins to descend and\r\ngoes on until he disappears beyond the horizon in September. Thus,\r\nin the northern regions, they have that which the traveller calls the\r\n\"midnight Sun,\" as he sees that luminary at a time when, in his more\r\nsouthern latitude, it is always midnight. If, then, for one-half the\r\nyear, we may see for ourselves the Sun making horizontal circles round\r\nthe heavens, it is presumptive evidence that, for the other half-year,\r\nhe is doing the same, although beyond the boundary of our vision. This,\r\nbeing a proof that Earth is a plane, is, therefore, a proof that the\r\nEarth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n39. We have abundance of evidence that the Sun moves daily round and\r\nover the Earth in circles concentric with the northern region over\r\nwhich hangs the North Star; but, since the theory of the Earth being a\r\nglobe is necessarily connected with the theory of its motion round the\r\nSun in a yearly orbit, it falls to the ground when we bring forward\r\nthe evidence of which we speak, and, in so doing, forms a proof that\r\nthe Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n40. The Suez Canal, which joins the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, is\r\nabout one hundred miles long; it forms a straight and level surface of\r\nwater from one end to the other; and no \"allowance\" for any supposed\r\n\"curvature\" was made in its construction. It is a clear proof that\r\nthe Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n41. When astronomers assert that it is \"necessary\" to make \"allowance\r\nfor curvature\" in canal construction, it is, of course, in order\r\nthat, in their idea, a level cutting may be had for the water. How\r\nflagrantly, then, do they contradict themselves when they say that\r\nthe curved surface of the Earth is a \"true level!\" What more can they\r\nwant for a canal than a true level? Since they contradict themselves\r\nin such an elementary point as this, it is an evidence that the whole\r\nthing is a delusion, and we have a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n42. It is certain that the theory of the Earth's rotundity and that\r\nof its mobility must stand or fall together. A proof, then, of its\r\nimmobility is virtually a proof of its non-rotundity. Now, that the\r\nEarth does not move, either on an axis, or in an orbit round the Sun\r\nor anything else, is easily proven. If the Earth went through space at\r\nthe rate of eleven-hundred miles in a minute of time, as astronomers\r\nteach us, in a particular direction, there would unquestionably be a\r\ndifference in the result of firing off a projectile in that direction\r\nand in a direction the opposite of that one. But as, in fact, there\r\nis not the slightest difference in any such case, it is clear that\r\nany alleged motion of the Earth is disproved, and that, therefore,\r\nwe have a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n43. The circumstances which attend bodies which are caused merely\r\nto fall from a great height prove nothing as to the motion or\r\nstability of the Earth, since the object, if it be on a thing that\r\nis in motion, will participate in that motion; but, if an object be\r\nthrown upwards from a body at rest, and, again, from a body in motion,\r\nthe circumstances attending its descent will be very different. In\r\nthe former case, it will fall, if thrown vertically upwards, at the\r\nplace from whence it was projected; in the latter case, it will fall\r\nbehind--the moving body from which it is thrown will leave it in the\r\nrear. Now, fix a gun, muzzle upwards, accurately, in the ground; fire\r\noff a projectile; and it will fall by the gun. If the Earth travelled\r\neleven-hundred miles a minute, the projectile would fall behind the\r\ngun, in the opposite direction to that of the supposed motion. Since,\r\nthen, this is NOT the case, in fact, the Earth's fancied motion is\r\nnegatived, and we have a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n44. It is in evidence that, if a projectile be fired from a rapidly\r\nmoving body in an opposite direction to that in which the body is\r\ngoing, it will fall short of the distance at which it would reach the\r\nground if fired in the direction of motion. Now, since the Earth is\r\nsaid to move at the rate of nineteen miles in a second of time, \"from\r\nwest to east,\" it would make all the difference imaginable if the gun\r\nwere fired in an opposite direction. But, as, in practice, there is\r\nnot the slightest difference, whichever way the thing may be done,\r\nwe have a forcible overthrow of all fancies relative to the motion\r\nof the Earth, and a striking proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n45. The Astronomer Royal, of England, George B. Airy, in his celebrated\r\nwork on Astronomy, the \"Ipswich Lectures,\" says: \"Jupiter is a large\r\nplanet that turns on his axis, and why do not we turn?\" Of course,\r\nthe common sense reply is: Because the Earth is not a planet! When,\r\ntherefore, an astronomer royal puts words into our mouth wherewith\r\nwe may overthrow the supposed planetary nature of the Earth, we have\r\nnot far to go to pick up a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n46. It has been shown that an easterly or a westerly motion is\r\nnecessarily a circular course round the central North. The only north\r\npoint or centre of motion of the heavenly bodies known to man is that\r\nformed by the North Star, which is over the central portion of the\r\noutstretched Earth. When, therefore, astronomers tell us of a planet\r\ntaking a westerly course round the Sun, the thing is as meaningless to\r\nthem as it is to us, unless they make the Sun the northern centre of\r\nthe motion, which they cannot do! Since, then, the motion which they\r\ntell us the planets have is, on the face of it, absurd; and since,\r\nas a matter of fact, the Earth can have no absurd motion at all,\r\nit is clear that it cannot be what astronomers say it is--a planet;\r\nand, if not a planet, it is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n47. In consequence of the fact being so plainly seen, by everyone\r\nwho visits the sea-shore, that the line of the horizon is a perfectly\r\nstraight line, it becomes impossible for astronomers, when they attempt\r\nto convey, pictorially, an idea of the Earth's \"convexity,\" to do\r\nso with even a shadow of consistency: for they dare not represent\r\nthis horizon as a curved line, so well known is it that it is a\r\nstraight one! The greatest astronomer of the age, in page 15 of his\r\n\"Lessons,\" gives an illustration of a ship sailing away, \"as though\r\nshe were rounding the top of a great hill of water;\" and there--of a\r\ntruth--is the straight and level line of the horizon clear along the\r\ntop of the \"hill\" from one side of the picture to the other! Now,\r\nif this picture were true in all its parts--and it is outrageously\r\nfalse in several--it would show that Earth is a cylinder; for the\r\n\"hill\" shown is simply up one side of the level, horizontal line, and,\r\nwe are led to suppose, down the other! Since, then, we have such high\r\nauthority as Professor Richard A. Proctor that the Earth is a cylinder,\r\nit is, certainly, a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n48. In Mr. Proctor's \"Lessons in Astronomy,\" page 15, a ship is\r\nrepresented as sailing away from the observer, and it is given in\r\nfive positions or distances away on its journey. Now, in its first\r\nposition, its mast appears above the horizon, and, consequently,\r\nhigher than the observer's line of vision. But, in its second\r\nand third positions, representing the ship as further and further\r\naway, it is drawn higher and still higher up above the line of the\r\nhorizon! Now, it is utterly impossible for a ship to sail away from\r\nan observer, under the conditions indicated, and to appear as given\r\nin the picture. Consequently, the picture is a misrepresentation, a\r\nfraud, and a disgrace. A ship starting to sail away from an observer\r\nwith her masts above his line of sight would appear, indisputably, to\r\ngo down and still lower down towards the horizon line, and could not\r\npossibly appear--to anyone with his vision undistorted--as going in any\r\nother direction, curved or straight. Since, then, the design of the\r\nastronomer-artist is to show the Earth to be a globe, and the points\r\nin the picture, which would only prove the Earth to be cylindrical if\r\ntrue, are NOT true, it follows that the astronomer-artist fails to\r\nprove, pictorially, either that the Earth is a globe or a cylinder,\r\nand that we have, therefore, a reasonable proof that the Earth is\r\nnot a globe.\r\n\r\n49. It is a well-known fact that clouds are continually seen moving in\r\nall manner of directions--yes, and frequently, in different directions\r\nat the same time--from west to east being as frequent a direction as\r\nany other. Now, if the Earth were a globe, revolving through space from\r\nwest to east at the rate of nineteen miles in a second, the clouds\r\nappearing to us to move towards the east would have to move quicker\r\nthan nineteen miles in a second to be thus seen; whilst those which\r\nappear to be moving in the opposite direction would have no necessity\r\nto be moving at all, since the motion of the Earth would be more than\r\nsufficient to cause the appearance. But it only takes a little common\r\nsense to show us that it is the clouds that move just as they appear\r\nto do, and that, therefore, the Earth is motionless. We have, then,\r\na proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n50. We read in the inspired book, or collection of books, called The\r\nBible, nothing at all about the Earth being a globe or a planet, from\r\nbeginning to end, but hundreds of allusions there are in its pages\r\nwhich could not be made if the Earth were a globe, and which are,\r\ntherefore, said by the astronomer to be absurd and contrary to what\r\nhe knows to be true! This is the groundwork of modern infidelity. But,\r\nsince every one of many, many allusions to the Earth and the heavenly\r\nbodies in the Scriptures can be demonstrated to be absolutely true\r\nto nature, and we read of the Earth being \"stretched out\" \"above the\r\nwaters,\" as \"standing in the water and out of the water,\" of its being\r\n\"established that it cannot be moved,\" we have a store from which to\r\ntake all the proofs we need, but we will just put down one proof--the\r\nScriptural proof--that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n51. A \"Standing Order\" exists in the English Houses of Parliament\r\nthat, in the cutting of canals, &c., the datum line employed shall\r\nbe a \"horizontal line, which shall be the same throughout the whole\r\nlength of the work.\" Now, if the Earth were a globe, this \"Order\"\r\ncould not be carried out: but, it is carried out: therefore, it is\r\na proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n52. It is a well-known and indisputable fact that there is a far\r\ngreater accumulation of ice south of the equator than is to be\r\nfound at an equal latitude north: and it is said that at Kerguelen,\r\n50 degrees south, 18 kinds of plants exist, whilst, in Iceland, 15\r\ndegrees nearer the northern centre, there are 870 species; and, indeed,\r\nall the facts in the case show that the Sun's power is less intense at\r\nplaces in the southern region than it is in corresponding latitudes\r\nnorth. Now, on the Newtonian hypothesis, all this is inexplicable,\r\nwhilst it is strictly in accordance with the facts brought to light by\r\nthe carrying out of the principles involved in the Zetetic Philosophy\r\nof \"Parallax.\" This is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n53. Every year the Sun is as long south of the equator as he is north;\r\nand if the Earth were not \"stretched out\" as it is, in fact, but\r\nturned under, as the Newtonian theory suggests, it would certainly\r\nget as intensive a share of the Sun's rays south as north; but the\r\nSouthern region being, in consequence of the fact stated, far more\r\nextensive than the region North, the Sun, having to complete his\r\njourney round every twenty-four hours, travels quicker as he goes\r\nfurther south, from September to December, and his influence has\r\nless time in which to accumulate at any given point. Since, then,\r\nthe facts could not be as they are if the Earth were a globe, it is\r\na proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n54. The aeronaut is able to start in his balloon and remain for hours\r\nin the air, at an elevation of several miles, and come down again\r\nin the same county or parish from which he ascended. Now, unless the\r\nEarth drag the balloon along with it in its nineteen-miles-a-second\r\nmotion, it must be left far behind, in space: but, since balloons\r\nhave never been known thus to be left, it is a proof that the Earth,\r\ndoes not move, and, therefore, a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n55. The Newtonian theory of astronomy requires that the Moon \"borrow\"\r\nher light from the Sun. Now, since the Sun's rays are hot and the\r\nMoon's light sends with it no heat at all, it follows that the Sun and\r\nMoon are \"two great lights,\" as we somewhere read; that the Newtonian\r\ntheory is a mistake; and that, therefore, we have a proof that the\r\nEarth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n56. The Sun and Moon may often be seen high in the heavens at the\r\nsame time--the Sun rising in the east and the Moon setting in the\r\nwest--the Sun's light positively putting the Moon's light out by sheer\r\ncontrast! If the accepted Newtonian theory were correct, and the Moon\r\nhad her light from the Sun, she ought to be getting more of it when\r\nface to face with that luminary--if it were possible for a sphere\r\nto act as a reflector all over its face! But as the Moon's light\r\npales before the rising Sun, it is a proof that the theory fails;\r\nand this gives us a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n57. The Newtonian hypothesis involves the necessity of the Sun, in\r\nthe case of a lunar eclipse, being on the opposite side of a globular\r\nearth, to cast its shadow on the Moon: but, since eclipses of the Moon\r\nhave taken place with both the Sun and the Moon above the horizon,\r\nit follows that it cannot be the shadow of the Earth that eclipses\r\nthe Moon; that the theory is a blunder; and that it is nothing less\r\nthan a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n58. Astronomers have never agreed amongst themselves about a rotating\r\nMoon revolving round a rotating and revolving Earth--this Earth,\r\nMoon, planets and their satellites all, at the same time dashing\r\nthrough space, around the rotating and revolving Sun, towards the\r\nconstellation Hercules, at the rate of four millions of miles a\r\nday! And they never will: agreement is impossible! With the Earth a\r\nplane and without motion, the whole thing is clear. And if a straw\r\nwill show which way the wind blows, this may be taken as a pretty\r\nstrong proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n59. Mr. Proctor says: \"The Sun is so far off that even moving from\r\none side of the Earth to the other does not cause him to be seen\r\nin a different direction--at least the difference is too small to\r\nbe measured.\" Now, since we know that north of the equator, say 45\r\ndegrees, we see the Sun at mid-day to the south, and that at the same\r\ndistance south of the equator we see the Sun at mid-day to the north,\r\nour very shadows on the ground cry aloud against the delusion of the\r\nday and give us a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n60. There is no problem more important to the astronomer than that\r\nof the Sun's distance from the Earth. Every change in the estimate\r\nchanges everything. Now, since modern astronomers, in their estimates\r\nof this distance, have gone all the way along the line of figures\r\nfrom three millions of miles to a hundred and four millions--to-day,\r\nthe distance being something over 91,000,000; it matters not how much:\r\nfor, not many years ago, Mr. Hind gave the distance, \"accurately,\"\r\nas 95,370,000!--it follows that they don't know, and that it is\r\nfoolish for anyone to expect that they ever will know, the Sun's\r\ndistance! And since all this speculation and absurdity is caused by\r\nthe primary assumption that Earth is a wandering, heavenly body, and\r\nis all swept away by a knowledge of the fact that Earth is a plane,\r\nit is a clear proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n61. It is plain that a theory of measurements without a measuring-rod\r\nis like a ship without a rudder; that a measure that is not fixed, not\r\nlikely to be fixed, and never has been fixed, forms no measuring-rod at\r\nall; and that as modern theoretical astronomy depends upon the Sun's\r\ndistance from the Earth as its measuring-rod, and the distance is\r\nnot known, it is a system of measurements without a measuring-rod--a\r\nship without a rudder. Now, since it is not difficult to foresee the\r\ndashing of this thing upon the rock on which Zetetic astronomy is\r\nfounded, it is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n62. It is commonly asserted that \"the Earth must be a globe because\r\npeople have sailed round it.\" Now, since this implies that we can sail\r\nround nothing unless it be a globe, and the fact is well known that\r\nwe can sail round the Earth as a plane, the assertion is ridiculous,\r\nand we have another proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n63. It is a fact not so well known as it ought to be that when a\r\nship, in sailing away from us, has reached the point at which her\r\nhull is lost to our unaided vision, a good telescope will restore to\r\nour view this portion of the vessel. Now, since telescopes are not\r\nmade to enable people to see through a \"hill of water,\" it is clear\r\nthat the hulls of ships are not behind a hill of water when they can\r\nbe seen through a telescope though lost to our unaided vision. This\r\nis a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n64. Mr. Glaisher, in speaking of his balloon ascends, says: \"The\r\nhorizon always appeared on a level with the car.\" Now, since we may\r\nsearch amongst the laws of optics in vain for any principle that\r\nwould cause the surface of a globe to turn its face upwards instead\r\nof downwards, it is a clear proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n65. The Rev. D. Olmsted, in describing a diagram which is supposed to\r\nrepresent the Earth as a globe, with a figure of a man sticking out\r\nat each side and one hanging head downwards, says: \"We should dwell\r\non this point until it appears to us as truly up,\"--in the direction\r\ngiven to these figures as it does with regard to a figure which he has\r\nplaced on the top! Now, a system of philosophy which requires us to\r\ndo something which is, really, the going out of our minds, by dwelling\r\non an absurdity until we think it is a fact, cannot be a system based\r\non God's truth, which never requires anything of the kind. Since,\r\nthen, the popular theoretical astronomy of the day requires this,\r\nit is evident that it is the wrong thing, and that this conclusion\r\nfurnishes us with a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n66. It is often said that the predictions of eclipses prove astronomers\r\nto be right in their theories. But it is not seen that this proves too\r\nmuch. It is well known that Ptolemy predicted eclipses for six-hundred\r\nyears, on the basis of a plane Earth, with as much accuracy as they\r\nare predicted by modern observers. If, then, the predictions prove\r\nthe truth of the particular theories current at the time, they just\r\nas well prove one side of the question as the other, and enable us\r\nto lay claim to a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n67. Seven-hundred miles is said to be the length of the great Canal, in\r\nChina. Certain it is that, when this canal was formed, no \"allowance\"\r\nwas made for \"curvature.\" Yet the canal is a fact without it. This\r\nis a Chinese proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n68. Mr. J. N. Lockyer says: \"Because the Sun seems to rise in the east\r\nand set in the west, the Earth really spins in the opposite direction;\r\nthat is, from west to east.\" Now, this is no better than though we were\r\nto say--Because a man seems to be coming up the street, the street\r\nreally goes down to the man! And since true science would contain\r\nno such nonsense as this, it follows that the so-called science of\r\ntheoretical astronomy is not true, and, therefore, we have a proof\r\nthat the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n69. Mr. Lockyer says: \"The appearances connected with the rising and\r\nsetting of the Sun and stars may be due either to our earth being at\r\nrest and the Sun and stars travelling round it, or the earth itself\r\nturning round, while the Sun and stars are at rest.\" Now, since true\r\nscience does not allow of any such beggarly alternatives as these,\r\nit is plain that modern theoretical astronomy is not true science,\r\nand that its leading dogma is a fallacy. We have, then, a plain proof\r\nthat the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n70. Mr. Lockyer, in describing his picture of the supposed proof of\r\nthe Earth's rotundity by means of ships rounding a \"hill of water,\"\r\nuses these words:--\"Diagram showing how, when we suppose the earth is\r\nround, we explain how it is that ships at sea appear as they do.\" This\r\nis utterly unworthy of the name of Science! A science that begins by\r\nsupposing, and ends by explaining the supposition, is, from beginning\r\nto end, a mere farce. The men who can do nothing better than amuse\r\nthemselves in this way must be denounced as dreamers only, and their\r\nleading dogma a delusion. This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n71. The astronomers' theory of a globular Earth necessitates the\r\nconclusion that, if we travel south of the equator, to see the North\r\nStar is an impossibility. Yet it is well known this star has been\r\nseen by navigators when they have been more than 20 degrees south of\r\nthe equator. This fact, like hundreds of other facts, puts the theory\r\nto shame, and gives us a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n72. Astronomers tell us that, in consequence of the Earth's\r\n\"rotundity,\" the perpendicular walls of buildings are, nowhere,\r\nparallel, and that even the walls of houses on opposite sides of\r\na street are not strictly so! But, since all observation fails to\r\nfind any evidence of this want of parallelism which theory demands,\r\nthe idea must be renounced as being absurd and in opposition to all\r\nwell-known facts. This is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n73. Astronomers have made experiments with pendulums which have been\r\nsuspended from the interior of high buildings, and have exulted\r\nover the idea of being able to prove the rotation of the Earth on\r\nits \"axis,\" by the varying direction taken by the pendulum over a\r\nprepared table underneath--asserting that the table moved round under\r\nthe pendulum, instead of the pendulum shifting and oscillating in\r\ndifferent directions over the table! But, since it has been found\r\nthat, as often as not, the pendulum went round the wrong way for\r\nthe \"rotation\" theory, chagrin has taken the place of exultation,\r\nand we have a proof of the failure of astronomers in their efforts\r\nto substantiate their theory, and, therefore, a proof that Earth is\r\nnot a globe.\r\n\r\n74. As to the supposed \"motion of the whole Solar system in space,\"\r\nthe Astronomer Royal of England once said: \"The matter is left in\r\na most delightful state of uncertainty, and I shall be very glad if\r\nanyone can help us out of it.\" But, since the whole Newtonian scheme\r\nis, to-day, in a most deplorable state of uncertainty--for, whether\r\nthe Moon goes round the Earth or the Earth round the Moon has, for\r\nyears, been a matter of \"raging\" controversy--it follows that, root\r\nand branch, the whole thing, is wrong; and, all hot from the raging\r\nfurnace of philosophical phrensy, we find a glowing proof that Earth\r\nis not a globe.\r\n\r\n75. Considerably more than a million Earths would be required to\r\nmake up a body like the Sun--the astronomers tell us: and more than\r\n53,000 suns would be wanted to equal the cubic contents of the star\r\nVega. And Vega is a \"small star!\" And there are countless millions of\r\nthese stars! And it takes 30,000,000 years for the light of some of\r\nthese stars to reach us at 12,000,000 miles in a minute! And, says\r\nMr. Proctor, \"I think a moderate estimate of the age of the Earth\r\nwould be 500,000,000 years!\" \"Its weight,\" says the same individual,\r\n\"is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons!\" Now, since no human being\r\nis able to comprehend these things, the giving of them to the world\r\nis an insult--an outrage. And though they have all arisen from the\r\none assumption that Earth is a planet, instead of upholding the\r\nassumption, they drag it down by the weight of their own absurdity,\r\nand leave it lying in the dust--a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n76. Mr. J. R. Young, in his work on Navigation, says: \"Although the\r\npath of the ship is on a spherical surface, yet we may represent\r\nthe length of the path by a straight line on a plane surface.\" (And\r\nplane sailing is the rule.) Now, since it is altogether impossible to\r\n\"represent\" a curved line by a straight one, and absurd to make the\r\nattempt, it follows that a straight line represents a straight line\r\nand not a curved one. And, since it is the surface of the waters\r\nof the ocean that is being considered by Mr. Young, it follows that\r\nthis surface is a straight surface, and we are indebted to Mr. Young,\r\na professor of navigation, for a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n77. \"Oh, but if the Earth is a plane, we could go to the edge and\r\ntumble over!\" is a very common assertion. This is a conclusion that\r\nis formed too hastily, and facts overthrow it. The Earth certainly is,\r\njust what man by his observation finds it to be, and what Mr. Proctor\r\nhimself says it \"seems\" to be--flat; and we cannot cross the icy\r\nbarrier which surrounds it. This is a complete answer to the objection,\r\nand, of course, a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n78. \"Yes, but we can circumnavigate the South easily enough,\" is\r\noften said--by those who don't know. The British Ship Challenger\r\nrecently completed the circuit of the Southern region--indirectly,\r\nto be sure--but she was three years about it, and traversed nearly\r\n69,000 miles--a stretch long enough to have taken her six times round\r\non the globular hypothesis. This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n79. The remark is common enough that we can see the circle of the Earth\r\nif we cross the ocean, and that this proves it to be round. Now, if we\r\ntie a donkey to a stake on a level common, and he eats the grass all\r\naround him, it is only a circular disc that he has to do with, not a\r\nspherical mass. Since, then, circular discs may be seen anywhere--as\r\nwell from a balloon in the air as from the deck of a ship, or from\r\nthe standpoint of the donkey, it is a proof that the surface of the\r\nEarth is a plane surface, and, therefore, a proof that the Earth is\r\nnot a globe.\r\n\r\n80. It is \"supposed,\" in the regular course of the Newtonian theory,\r\nthat the Earth is, in June, about 190 millions of miles (190,000,000)\r\naway from its position in December. Now, since we can, (in middle north\r\nlatitudes), see the North Star, on looking out of a window that faces\r\nit--and out of the very same corner of the very same pane of glass in\r\nthe very same window--all the year round, it is proof enough for any\r\nman in his senses that we have made no motion at all. It is a proof\r\nthat the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n81. Newtonian philosophers teach us that the Moon goes round the\r\nEarth from west to east. But observation--man's most certain mode\r\nof gaining knowledge--shows us that the Moon never ceases to move in\r\nthe opposite direction--from east to west. Since, then, we know that\r\nnothing can possibly move in two, opposite directions at the same\r\ntime, it is a proof that the thing is a big blunder; and, in short,\r\nit is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n82. Astronomers tell us that the Moon goes round the Earth in about\r\n28 days. Well, we may see her making her journey round, every day,\r\nif we make use of our eyes--and these are about the best things we\r\nhave to use. The Moon falls behind in her daily motion as compared\r\nwith that of the Sun to the extent of one revolution in the time\r\nspecified; but that is not making a revolution. Failing to go as fast\r\nas other bodies go in one direction does not constitute a going round\r\nin the opposite one--as the astronomers would have us believe! And,\r\nsince all this absurdity has been rendered necessary for no other\r\npurpose than to help other absurdities along, it is clear that the\r\nastronomers are on the wrong track; and it needs no long train of\r\nreasoning to show that we have a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n83. It has been shown that meridians are, necessarily, straight lines;\r\nand that it is impossible to travel round the Earth in a north or\r\nsouth direction: from which it follows that, in the general acceptation\r\nof the word \"degree,\"--the 360th part of a circle--meridians have no\r\ndegrees: for no one knows anything of a meridian circle or semicircle,\r\nto be thus divided. But astronomers speak of degrees of latitude in\r\nthe same sense as those of longitude. This, then, is done by assuming\r\nthat to be true which is not true. Zetetic philosophy does not involve\r\nthis necessity. This proves that the basis of this philosophy is a\r\nsound one, and, in short, is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n84. If we move away from an elevated object on or over a plain or\r\na prairie, the height of the object will apparently diminish as we\r\ndo so. Now, that which is sufficient to produce this effect on a\r\nsmall scale is sufficient on a large one; and travelling away from an\r\nelevated object, no matter how high, over a level surface, no matter\r\nhow far, will cause the appearance in question--the lowering of the\r\nobject. Our modern theoretical astronomers, however, in the case\r\nof the apparent lowering of the North Star as we travel southward,\r\nassert that it is evidence that the Earth is globular! But, as it is\r\nclear that an appearance which is fully accounted for on the basis of\r\nknown facts cannot be permitted to figure as evidence in favor of that\r\nwhich is only a supposition, it follows that we rightfully order it\r\nto stand down, and make way for a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n85. There are rivers which flow east, west, north, and south--that\r\nis, rivers are flowing in all directions over the Earth's surface,\r\nand at the same time. Now, if the Earth were a globe, some of these\r\nrivers would be flowing up-hill and others down, taking it for a fact\r\nthat there really is an \"up\" and a \"down\" in nature, whatever form she\r\nassumes. But, since rivers do not flow up-hill, and the globular theory\r\nrequires that they should, it is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n86. If the Earth were a globe, rolling and dashing through \"space\"\r\nat the rate of \"a hundred miles in five seconds of time,\" the\r\nwaters of seas and oceans could not, by any known law, be kept\r\non its surface--the assertion that they could be retained under\r\nthese circumstances being an outrage upon human understanding and\r\ncredulity! But as the Earth--that is, the habitable world of dry\r\nland--is found to be \"standing out of the water and in the water\"\r\nof the \"mighty deep,\" whose circumferential boundary is ice, we\r\nmay throw the statement back into the teeth of those who make it\r\nand flaunt before their faces the flag of reason and common sense,\r\ninscribed with--a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n87. The theory of a rotating and revolving earth demands a theory\r\nto keep the water on its surface; but, as the theory which is given\r\nfor this purpose is as much opposed to all human experience as the\r\none which it is intended to uphold, it is an illustration of the\r\nmiserable makeshifts to which astronomers are compelled to resort,\r\nand affords a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n88. If we could--after our minds had once been opened to the light of\r\nTruth--conceive of a globular body on the surface of which human beings\r\ncould exist, the power--no matter by what name it be called--that would\r\nhold them on would, then, necessarily, have to be so constraining\r\nand cogent that they could not live; the waters of the oceans would\r\nhave to be as a solid mass, for motion would be impossible. But we\r\nnot only exist, but live and move; and the water of the ocean skips\r\nand dances like a thing of life and beauty! This is a proof that the\r\nEarth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n89. It is well known that the law regulating the apparent decrease\r\nin the size of objects as we leave them in the distance (or as they\r\nleave us) is very different with luminous bodies from what it is in\r\nthe case of those which are non-luminous. Sail past the light of a\r\nsmall lamp in a row-boat on a dark night, and it will seem to be no\r\nsmaller when a mile off than it was when close to it. Proctor says, in\r\nspeaking of the Sun: \"his apparent size does not change,\"--far off or\r\nnear. And then he forgets the fact! Mr. Proctor tells us, subsequently,\r\nthat, if the traveller goes so far south that the North Star appears\r\non the horizon, \"the Sun should therefore look much larger\"--if the\r\nEarth were a plane! Therefore, he argues, \"the path followed cannot\r\nhave been the straight course,\"--but a curved one. Now, since it\r\nis nothing but common scientific trickery to bring forward, as an\r\nobjection to stand in the way of a plane Earth, the non-appearance of\r\na thing which has never been known to appear at all, it follows that,\r\nunless that which appears to be trickery were an accident, it was the\r\nonly course open to the objector--to trick. (Mr. Proctor, in a letter\r\nto the \"English Mechanic\" for Oct. 20, 1871, boasts of having turned\r\na recent convert to the Zetetic philosophy by telling him that his\r\narguments were all very good, but that \"it seems as though [mark the\r\nlanguage!] the sun ought to look nine times larger in summer.\" And\r\nMr. Proctor concludes thus: \"He saw, indeed, that, in his faith in\r\n'Parallax,' he had 'written himself down an ass.'\") Well, then:\r\ntrickery or no trickery on the part of the objector, the objection\r\nis a counterfeit--a fraud--no valid objection at all; and it follows\r\nthat the system which does not purge itself of these things is a\r\nrotten system, and the system which its advocates, with Mr. Proctor\r\nat their head, would crush if they could find a weapon to use--the\r\nZetetic philosophy of \"Parallax\"--is destined to live! This is a\r\nproof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n90. \"Is water level, or is it not?\" was a question once asked of an\r\nastronomer. \"Practically, yes; theoretically, no,\" was the reply. Now,\r\nwhen theory does not harmonize with practice, the best thing to\r\ndo is to drop the theory. (It is getting too late, now, to say \"So\r\nmuch the worse for the facts!\") To drop the theory which supposes a\r\ncurved surface to standing water is to acknowledge the facts which\r\nform the basis of Zetetic philosophy. And since this will have to be\r\ndone--sooner or later,--it is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n91. \"By actual observation,\" says Schoedler, in his \"Book of Nature,\"\r\n\"we know that the other heavenly bodies are spherical, hence we\r\nunhesitatingly assert that the earth is so also.\" This is a fair sample\r\nof all astronomical reasoning. When a thing is classed amongst \"other\"\r\nthings, the likeness between them must first be proven. It does not\r\ntake a Schoedler to tell us that \"heavenly bodies\" are spherical, but\r\n\"the greatest astronomer of the age\" will not, now, dare to tell us\r\nthat The Earth is--and attempt to prove it. Now, since no likeness\r\nhas ever been proven to exist between the Earth and the heavenly\r\nbodies, the classification of the Earth with the heavenly bodies is\r\npremature--unscientific--false! This is a proof that Earth is not\r\na globe.\r\n\r\n92. \"There is no inconsistency in supposing that the earth does move\r\nround the sun,\" says the Astronomer Royal of England. Certainly\r\nnot, when theoretical astronomy is all supposition together! The\r\ninconsistency is in teaching the world that the thing supposed\r\nis a fact. Since, then, the \"motion\" of the Earth is supposition\r\nonly--since, indeed, it is necessary to suppose it at all--it is\r\nplain that it is a fiction and not a fact; and, since \"mobility\" and\r\n\"sphericity\" stand or fall together, we have before us a proof that\r\nEarth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n93. We have seen that astronomers--to give us a level surface on which\r\nto live--have cut off one-half of the \"globe\" in a certain picture in\r\ntheir books. [See page 6.] Now, astronomers having done this, one-half\r\nof the substance of their \"spherical theory\" is given up! Since, then,\r\nthe theory must stand or fall in its entirety, it has really fallen\r\nwhen the half is gone. Nothing remains, then, but a plane Earth,\r\nwhich is, of course, a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n94. In \"Cornell's Geography\" there is an \"Illustrated proof of the Form\r\nof the Earth.\" A curved line on which is represented a ship in four\r\npositions, as she sails away from an observer, is an arc of 72 degrees,\r\nor one-fifth of the supposed circumference of the \"globe\"--about 5,000\r\nmiles. Ten such ships as those which are given in the picture would\r\nreach the full length of the \"arc,\" making 500 miles as the length\r\nof the ship. The man, in the picture, who is watching the ship as she\r\nsails away, is about 200 miles high; and the tower, from which he takes\r\nan elevated view, at least 500 miles high. These are the proportions,\r\nthen, of men, towers, and ships which are necessary in order to see\r\na ship, in her different positions, as she \"rounds the curve\" of the\r\n\"great hill of water\" over which she is supposed to be sailing: for,\r\nit must be remembered that this supposed \"proof\" depends upon lines\r\nand angles of vision which, if enlarged, would still retain their\r\ncharacteristics. Now, since ships are not built 500 miles long,\r\nwith masts in proportion, and men are not quite 200 miles high,\r\nit is not what it is said to be--a proof of rotundity--but, either\r\nan ignorant farce or a cruel piece of deception. In short, it is a\r\nproof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n95. In \"Cornell's Intermediate Geography,\" (1881) page 12, is an\r\n\"Illustration of the Natural Divisions of Land and Water.\" This\r\nillustration is so nicely drawn that it affords, at once, a striking\r\nproof that Earth is a plane. It is true to nature, and bears the\r\nstamp of no astronomer-artist. It is a pictorial proof that Earth is\r\nnot a globe.\r\n\r\n96. If we refer to the diagram in \"Cornell's Geography,\" page 4, and\r\nnotice the ship in its position the most remote from the observer, we\r\nshall find that, though it is about 4,000 miles away, it is the same\r\nsize as the ship that is nearest to him, distant about 700 miles! This\r\nis an illustration of the way in which astronomers ignore the laws\r\nof perspective. This course is necessary, or they would be compelled\r\nto lay bare the fallacy of their dogmas. In short, there is, in this\r\nmatter, a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n97. Mr. Hind, the English astronomer, says: \"The simplicity with\r\nwhich the seasons are explained by the revolution of the Earth in her\r\norbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic, may certainly be adduced as a\r\nstrong presumptive proof of the correctness\"--of the Newtonian theory;\r\n\"for on no other rational suppositions with respect to the relations\r\nof the Earth and Sun, can these and other as well-known phenomena,\r\nbe accounted for.\" But, as true philosophy has no \"suppositions\"\r\nat all--and has nothing to do with \"suppositions\"--and the phenomena\r\nspoken of are thoroughly explained by facts, the \"presumptive proof\"\r\nfalls to the ground, covered with the ridicule it so richly deserves;\r\nand out of the dust of Mr. Hind's \"rational suppositions\" we see\r\nstanding before us a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n98. Mr. Hind speaks of the astronomer watching a star as it is \"carried\r\nacross the telescope by the diurnal revolution of the Earth.\" Now,\r\nthis is nothing but downright absurdity. No motion of the Earth could\r\npossibly carry a star across a telescope or anything else. If the\r\nstar is carried across anything at all, it is the star that moves,\r\nnot the thing across which it is carried! Besides, the idea that the\r\nEarth, if it were a globe, could possibly move in an orbit of nearly\r\n600,000,000 of miles with such exactitude that the cross-hairs in\r\na telescope fixed on its surface would appear to glide gently over\r\na star \"millions of millions\" of miles away is simply monstrous;\r\nwhereas, with a FIXED telescope, it matters not the distance of the\r\nstars, though we suppose them to be as far off as the astronomer\r\nsupposes them to be; for, as Mr. Proctor himself says, \"the further\r\naway they are, the less they will seem to shift.\" Why, in the name of\r\ncommon sense, should observers have to fix their telescopes on solid\r\nstone bases so that they should not move a hair's-breadth, if the\r\nEarth on which they fix them move at the rate of nineteen miles in a\r\nsecond? Indeed, to believe that Mr. Proctor's mass of \"six thousand\r\nmillion million million tons\" is \"rolling, surging, flying, darting\r\non through space for ever\" with a velocity compared with which a shot\r\nfrom a cannon is a \"very slow coach,\" with such unerring accuracy\r\nthat a telescope fixed on granite pillars in an observatory will not\r\nenable a lynx-eyed astronomer to detect a variation in its onward\r\nmotion of the thousandth part of a hair's-breadth is to conceive a\r\nmiracle compared with which all the miracles on record put together\r\nwould sink into utter insignificance. Captain R. J. Morrison, the late\r\ncompiler of \"Zadkeil's Almanac,\" says: \"We declare that this 'motion'\r\nis all mere 'bosh'; and that the arguments which uphold it are,\r\nwhen examined with an eye that seeks for TRUTH only, mere nonsense,\r\nand childish absurdity.\" Since, then, these absurd theories are of\r\nno use to men in their senses, and since there is no necessity for\r\nanything of the kind in Zetetic philosophy, it is a \"strong presumptive\r\nproof\"--as Mr. Hind would say--that the Zetetic philosophy is true,\r\nand, therefore, a proof that Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n99. Mr. Hind speaks of two great mathematicians differing only\r\nfifty-five yards in their estimate of the Earth's diameter. Why,\r\nSir John Herschel, in his celebrated work, cuts off 480 miles of\r\nthe same thing to get \"round numbers!\" This is like splitting a\r\nhair on one side of the head and shaving all the hair off on the\r\nother! Oh, \"science!\" Can there be any truth in a science like\r\nthis? All the exactitude in astronomy is in Practical astronomy--not\r\nTheoretical. Centuries of observation have made practical astronomy a\r\nnoble art and science, based--as we have a thousand times proved it\r\nto be--on a fixed Earth; and we denounce this pretended exactitude\r\non one side and the reckless indifference to figures on the other\r\nas the basest trash, and take from it a proof that the \"science\"\r\nwhich tolerates it is a false--instead of being an \"exact\"--science,\r\nand we have a proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n100. The Sun, as he travels round over the surface of the Earth, brings\r\n\"noon\" to all places on the successive meridians which he crosses:\r\nhis journey being made in a westerly direction, places east of the\r\nSun's position have had their noon, whilst places to the west of the\r\nSun's position have still to get it. Therefore, if we travel easterly,\r\nwe arrive at those parts of the Earth where \"time\" is more advanced,\r\nthe watch in our pocket has to be \"put on,\" or we may be said to\r\n\"gain time.\" If, on the other hand, we travel westerly, we arrive at\r\nplaces where it is still \"morning,\" the watch has to be \"put back,\"\r\nand it may be said that we \"lose time.\" But, if we travel easterly\r\nso as to cross the 180th meridian, there is a loss, there, of a day,\r\nwhich will neutralize the gain of a whole circumnavigation; and, if\r\nwe travel westerly, and cross the same meridian, we experience the\r\ngain of a day, which will compensate for the loss during a complete\r\ncircumnavigation in that direction. The fact of losing or gaining time\r\nin sailing round the world, then, instead of being evidence of the\r\nEarth's \"rotundity,\" as it is imagined to be, is, in its practical\r\nexemplification, an everlasting proof that the Earth is not a globe.\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\" What then! No intelligent man will ask the question;\r\nand he who may be called an intellectual man will know that the\r\ndemonstration of the fact that the Earth is not a globe is the grandest\r\nsnapping of the chains of slavery that ever took place in the world of\r\nliterature or science. The floodgates of human knowledge are opened\r\nafresh and an impetus is given to investigation and discovery where\r\nall was stagnation, bewilderment and dreams! Is it nothing to know\r\nthat infidelity cannot stand against the mighty rush of the living\r\nwater of Truth that must flow on and on until the world shall look \"up\"\r\nonce more \"to Him that stretched out the earth above the waters\"--\"to\r\nHim that made great lights:--the Sun to rule by day--the Moon and\r\nStars to rule by night?\" Is it nothing to know and to feel that the\r\nheavenly bodies were made for man, and that the monstrous dogma of\r\nan infinity of worlds is overthrown for ever? The old-time English\r\n\"Family Herald,\" for July 25, 1885, says, in its editorial, that\r\n\"The earth's revolution on its own axis was denied, against Galileo\r\nand Copernicus, by the whole weight of the Church of Rome.\" And, in\r\nan article on \"The Pride of Ignorance,\" too!--the editor not knowing\r\nthat if the Earth had an axis to call its \"own\"--which the Church\r\nwell knew it had not, and, therefore, could not admit--it would not\r\n\"revolve\" on it; and that the theoretical motion on an axis is that of\r\nrotation, and not revolution! Is it nothing to know that \"the whole\r\nweight of the Church of Rome\" was thrown in the right direction,\r\nalthough it has swayed back again like a gigantic pendulum that will\r\nregain its old position before long? Is it nothing to know that the\r\n\"pride of ignorance\" is on the other side? Is it nothing to know\r\nthat, with all the Bradlaughs and Ingersolls of the world telling\r\nus to the contrary--Biblical science is true? Is it nothing to know\r\nthat we are living on a body at rest, and not upon a heavenly body\r\nwhirling and dashing through space in every conceivable way and with\r\na velocity utterly inconceivable? Is it nothing to know that we can\r\nlook stedfastly up to Heaven instead of having no heaven to look\r\nup to at all? Is it nothing, indeed, to be in the broad daylight of\r\nTruth and to be able to go on towards a possible perfection, instead\r\nof being wrapped in the darkness of error on the rough ocean of Life,\r\nand finding ourselves stranded at last--God alone knows where?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Baltimore, Maryland, U.

R. A. Proctor, Esq.,\r\nSt. Joe, Mo. Sir: I have sent you two copies of my 'One Hundred\r\nProofs that the Earth is Not a Globe,' and, as several weeks have\r\nsince elapsed and I have not heard from you, I write to inform you\r\nthat if you have any remarks to make concerning that publication,\r\nand will let me have them in the course of a week or ten days, I will\r\nprint them--if you say what you may wish to say in about five or six\r\nhundred words--in the second edition of the pamphlet, which will very\r\nsoon be called for. Allow me to say that, as this work is not only\r\n'dedicated' to you but attacks your teachings, the public will be\r\nlooking for something from your pen very shortly. I hope they may\r\nnot be disappointed. Yours in the cause of truth, W. Carpenter.\"\r\n\r\n\"71 Chew Street, Baltimore, Nov. 24, 1885. Spencer F. Baird, Esq.,\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. Sir:--I\r\nhad the pleasure, several weeks ago, of sending you my 'One Hundred\r\nProofs that the Earth is Not a Globe.' I hope you received them. A\r\nsecond edition is now called for, and I should esteem it a favor if\r\nyou would write me a few words concerning them that I may print with\r\nthis forthcoming edition as an appendix to them. If you think any of\r\nthe 'Hundred Proofs' are unsound, I will print all you may have to\r\nsay about them, if not over 400 words, as above stated. I have made\r\nRichard A. Proctor, Esq., a similar offer, giving him, of course,\r\na little more space. I feel sure that the very great importance of\r\nthis matter will prompt you to give it your immediate attention. I\r\nhave the honor to be, sir, yours sincerely, Wm. Carpenter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopies of the first edition of this pamphlet have been sent to\r\nthe leading newspapers of this country and of England, and to very\r\nmany of the most renowned scientific men of the two countries--from\r\nthe Astronomer Royal, of England, to Dr. Gilman, of Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, Baltimore. Several copies have been sent to graduates\r\nof different Universities, on application, in consequence of the\r\nsubjoined advertisement, which has appeared in several newspapers:--\r\n\r\n\"WANTED.--A Scholar of ripe attainments to review Carpenter's 'One\r\nHundred Proofs that the Earth is Not a Globe.'

His arguments\r\nare certainly plausible and ingenious, and even the reader who does\r\nnot agree with him will find a singular interest and fascination in\r\nanalyzing the 'one hundred proofs.'...

There is no groping wildly about\r\nin the vagueness of theoretical speculations, no empty hypotheses\r\ninflated with baseless assertions and false illustrations, but the\r\npractical and perspicuous conclusions of a mind emancipated from the\r\nprevailing influences of fashionable credence and popular prejudice,\r\nand subordinate only to those principles emanating from reason and\r\ncommon sense.\"--H. D. T., Woodberry News, Sept. 26, 1885.\r\n\r\n\"We do not profess to be able to overthrow any of his 'Proofs.' And we\r\nmust admit, and our readers will be inclined to do the same, that it\r\nis certainly a strange thing that Mr. Wm. Carpenter, or anyone else,\r\nshould be able to bring together 'One Hundred Proofs' of anything\r\nin the world if that thing is not right, while we keep on asking for\r\none proof, that is really a satisfactory one, on the other side.

The author has the courage of his\r\nconvictions, and presents them with no little ingenuity, however musty\r\nthey may appear to nineteenth century readers. He takes for his text\r\na statement of Prof. Proctor's that 'The Earth on which we live and\r\nmove seems to be flat,' and proceeds with great alacrity to marshal\r\nhis hundred arguments in proof that it not only seems but is flat,\r\n'an extended plane, stretched out in all directions away from the\r\ncentral North.' He enumerates all the reasons offered by scientists\r\nfor a belief in the rotundity of the earth and evidently to his\r\nown complete satisfaction refutes them. He argues that the heavenly\r\nbodies were made solely to light this world, that the belief in an\r\ninfinity of worlds is a monstrous dogma, contrary to Bible teaching,\r\nand the great stronghold of the infidel; and that the Church of Rome\r\nwas right when it threw the whole weight of its influence against\r\nGalileo and Copernicus when they taught the revolution of the earth\r\non its axis.\"--Michigan Christian Herald, Oct. 15, 1885.\r\n\r\n\"So many proofs.\"--Every Saturday, Sept. 26, 1885.\r\n\r\n\"A highly instructive and very entertaining work....

A review of it to do it\r\njustice would be a somewhat long and laborious task. Before I undertook\r\nso much thought I would write and ask What and how much you expect:\r\nhow elaborately you wished it discussed: and what remuneration might\r\nbe expected. It sets forth many new and strange doctrines which would\r\nhave to be thoroughly discussed and mastered before reviewed. I am\r\nhard at work at present but would like to tackle this if it would\r\nbe for my interest as well as yours. Hope you will let me know very\r\nsoon. Very respectfully,\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W. Carpenter, Baltimore, Md.      FRANK STRONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Unless a man be willing to sell his soul for his supposed\r\nworldly \"interest,\" he will not dare to \"tackle\" the \"One Hundred\r\nProofs that the Earth is Not a Globe.\" No man with well-balanced\r\nfaculties will thus condemn himself. We charge the mathematicians of\r\nthe world that, if they cannot say what they think of this pamphlet\r\nin a dozen words, they are entitled to no other name than--cowards!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Baltimore, Maryland, May 22, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO THE FIFTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Editorial from the \"New York World,\" of August 2, 1886:--\r\n\r\n                           THE EARTH IS FLAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iconoclastic tendencies of the age have received new impetus from\r\nMr. William Carpenter, who comes forward with one hundred proofs that\r\nthe earth is not a globe. It will be a sad shock to many conservatives\r\nwho have since their childhood fondly held to the conviction that \"the\r\nearth is round like an orange, a little flattened at the poles.\" To\r\nfind that, after all, we have been living all these years on a prosaic\r\nand unromantic plane is far from satisfactory. We have rather gloried\r\nin the belief that the semi-barbarous nations on the other side of\r\nthe earth did not carry their heads in the same direction in which\r\nours point. It is hard to accept the assertion that the cannibals on\r\nsavage islands are walking about on the same level with the civilized\r\nnations of our little world.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Carpenter has one hundred proofs that such is the\r\nunsatisfactory truth. Not only that, but the iconoclast claims\r\nthat we are not whirling through space at a terrible rate, but are\r\nabsolutely stationary. Some probability is given to this proposition\r\nby the present hot weather. The earth seems to be becalmed. If it\r\nwere moving at the rate of nineteen miles a second wouldn't there\r\nbe a breeze? This question is thrown out as perhaps offering the one\r\nhundred and first proof that the earth is not a globe. Mr. Carpenter\r\nmay obtain the proof in detail at the office at our usual rates. A\r\nrevolution will, of course, take place in the school geographies\r\nas soon as Mr. Carpenter's theories have been closely studied. No\r\nlonger will the little boy answer the question as to the shape of\r\nthe earth by the answer which has come ringing down the ages, \"It's\r\nround like a ball, sir.\" No. He'll have to use the unpoetic formula,\r\n\"It's flat like a pancake, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, after we have become used to the new idea it will not\r\nbe unpleasant. The ancients flourished in the belief that the earth\r\nwas a great plane. Why shouldn't we be equally fortunate? It may\r\nbe romantic but it is not especially comforting to think that the\r\nearth is rushing through space twisting and curving like a gigantic\r\nball delivered from the hand of an enormous pitcher. Something in\r\nthe universe might make a base hit if we kept on and we would be\r\nknocked over an aerial fence and never found. Perhaps, after all,\r\nit is safer to live on Mr. Carpenter's stationary plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Record,\" of Philadelphia, June 5, 1886, has the following, in\r\nthe Literary Notes:--\"Under the title One Hundred Proofs that the\r\nEarth is Not a Globe, Mr. William Carpenter, of Baltimore, publishes\r\na pamphlet which is interesting on account of the originality of the\r\nviews advanced, and, from his standpoint, the very logical manner in\r\nwhich he seeks to establish their truth. Mr. Carpenter is a disciple\r\nof what is called the Zetetic school of philosophy, and was referee\r\nfor Mr. John Hampden when that gentleman, in 1870, made a wager with\r\nMr. Alfred R. Wallace, of England, that the surface of standing water\r\nis always level, and therefore that the earth is flat. Since then\r\nhe has combated his views with much earnestness, both in writing and\r\non the platform, and, whatever opinions we may have on the subject,\r\na perusal of his little book will prove interesting and afford room\r\nfor careful study.\"\r\n\r\n\"The motto which he puts on the cover--'Upright, Downright,\r\nStraightforward'--is well chosen, for it is an upright lie, a downright\r\ninvention, and a straightforward butt of a bull at a locomotive.\"--The\r\nFlorida Times Union, Dec. 13, 1885.

I write, now, to ask you if you\r\nreceived my letter. I am quite sure that you will consider that the\r\nimportance of the subject fully warrants the endeavor on my part to\r\ngain the views which may be entertained by you respecting it. The\r\nfifth edition will soon be called for, and anything you may urge--for\r\nor against--I shall be happy to insert in the \"appendix.\" I send,\r\nherewith, a copy of the fourth edition of the pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, William Carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             71 Chew Street, Baltimore, October 7, 1886.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gilman--Dear Sir: I am now preparing the appendix for\r\nthe fifth edition of my \"One Hundred Proofs that the Earth is Not a\r\nGlobe,\" and I should be glad to receive your opinion of this work to\r\ninsert in the said appendix. I can offer you from a few lines to a\r\npage, or two if necessary. Of course, if this work as a whole be a\r\nfraud, it must be fraudulent in all its parts; and each one of the\r\n\"hundred proofs\" must contain a fallacy of some kind or other, and\r\nthe thing would justify your disapprobation--expressed in few words\r\nor many.

I wrote this work (26 pages) in one week, without\r\nneglecting my daily business: surely, you can reply to it in a week\r\nfrom this time. I will give you from one to four pages, if you wish\r\nthat amount of space, and send you fifty copies, if you desire to have\r\nthem, without putting you to the slightest expense. I will even take\r\nany suggestion you please to make as to the title which shall be given\r\nto this extra edition of my work containing your reply or opinions. I\r\nshould be sorry to be under the necessity of printing this letter,\r\nwith others, in my next edition, in the place of any such reply or\r\nexpression of opinion; for I feel sure there is no one in Baltimore who\r\nis more capable of giving an opinion on this great subject.

This is the largest single endowment ever made to an institution\r\nof learning in this country. To the bequest no burdensome conditions\r\nwere attached.\"... \"The Physiological Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins\r\nhas no peer in this country, and the other laboratories few equals\r\nand no superiors.\"\r\n\r\nIn the First Annual Report of the University (1876) we read:--\"Early\r\nin the month of February, 1874, the Trustees of the University having\r\nbeen apprised by the Executors of Johns Hopkins, of the endowment\r\nprovided by his will, took proper steps for organization and entering\r\nupon the practical duties of the trust, and addressed themselves to\r\nthe selection of a President of the University. With this view the\r\nTrustees sought the counsel and advice of the heads of several of\r\nthe leading seats of learning in the country, and, upon unanimous\r\nrecommendation and endorsement from these sources, the choice fell\r\nupon Mr. Daniel C. Gilman, who, at the time, occupied the position\r\nof President of the University of California.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gilman is a graduate of Yale College, and for several years\r\nbefore his call to California, was a Professor in that institution,\r\ntaking an active part in the organization and development of 'The\r\nSheffield Scientific School of Yale College,' at New Haven.

It is impossible to be successful hunters\r\nfor Truth, if Error be allowed to go scot-free. Nay, it is utterly\r\nimpossible for the Johns Hopkins University to answer the purpose\r\nof its founder if its hunters for Truth do not first hunt Error with\r\ntheir hounds and hold it up to ridicule, and then, and always, keep\r\na watchful eye for the Truth lest they should injure it by their\r\nhot haste or wound it with their weapons. Prof. Daniel C. Gilman,\r\nwe charge you that the duties of your office render it imperative\r\nthat, sooner or later, you lead your men into the field against the\r\nhundred proofs, to show the world that they are hunters worthy of the\r\nname--if, in your superior judgment, you decide that there is Error\r\nto be slain--or, show that your hunters are worthy of the better name\r\nof men, by inducing them to follow and sustain you, out of the beaten\r\ntrack, in your endeavors to uphold God's Truth, if, in your superior\r\njudgment, you tell them, \"There is a Truth to be upheld!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       [End of the Appendix to the Fifth Edition.

Philosophy\r\nimposes the truth upon us; but the view of the earth from the elevation\r\nof a balloon is that of an immense terrestrial basin, the deeper part\r\nof which is that directly under one's feet. As we ascend, the earth\r\nbeneath us seems to recede--actually to sink away--while the horizon\r\ngradually and gracefully lifts a diversified slope, stretching away\r\nfarther and farther to a line that, at the highest elevation, seems\r\nto close with the sky. Thus, upon a clear day, the aeronaut feels\r\nas if suspended at about an equal distance between the vast blue\r\noceanic concave above and the equally expanded terrestrial basin\r\nbelow.\"--Mr. Elliott, Baltimore.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Scientific American,\" for April 27, 1878, is a full report\r\nof a lecture delivered at Berlin, by Dr. Shoepfer, headed \"Our Earth\r\nMotionless,\" which concludes thus:--\"The poet Goethe, whose prophetic\r\nviews remained during his life wholly unnoticed, said the following:\r\n'In whatever way or manner may have occurred this business, I must\r\nstill say that I curse this modern theory of cosmogony, and hope\r\nthat perchance there may appear in due time some young scientist of\r\ngenius who will pick up courage enough to upset this universally\r\ndisseminated delirium of lunatics. The most terrible thing in all\r\nthis is that one is obliged to repeatedly hear the assurance that all\r\nthe physicists adhere to the same opinion on this question. But one\r\nwho is acquainted with men knows how it is done: good, intellectual,\r\nand courageous heads adorn their mind with such an idea for the sake\r\nof its probability; they gather followers and pupils, and thus form\r\na literary power; their idea is finally worked out, exaggerated,\r\nand with a passionate impulse is forced upon society; hundreds and\r\nhundreds of noble-minded, reasonable people who work in other spheres,\r\ndesiring to see their circle esteemed and dear to the interests of\r\ndaily life, can do nothing better or more reasonable than to leave to\r\nother investigators their free scope of action, and add their voice in\r\nthe benefit of that business which does not concern them at all. This\r\nis termed the universal corroboration of the truthfulness of an idea!'\"",
