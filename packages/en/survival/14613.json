I looked upon it as a more favourable\r\nopportunity to season my mind and to bring me into a nearer sympathy\r\nwith them.--_Journal of John Woolman_, 1762.\r\n\r\nI determined to commence my researches at some distance from the\r\ncapital, being well aware of the erroneous ideas I must form should I\r\njudge from what I heard in a city so much subjected to foreign\r\nintercourse.--BORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hope with which these pages are written is that their readers may\r\nbe enabled to see a little deeper into that problem of the relation of\r\nthe West with Asia which the historian of the future will\r\nunquestionably regard as the greatest of our time.\r\n\r\nI lived for four and a half years in Japan. This book is a record of\r\nmany of the things I saw and experienced and some of the things I was\r\ntold chiefly during rural journeys--more than half the population is\r\nrural--extending to twice the distance across the United States or\r\nnearly eight times the distance between the English Channel and John\r\no' Groats.\r\n\r\nThese pages deal with a field of investigation in Japan which no other\r\nvolume has explored. Because they fall short of what was planned, and\r\nin happier conditions might have been accomplished, a word or two may\r\nbe pardoned on the beginnings of the book--one of the many literary\r\nvictims of the War.\r\n\r\nThe first book I ever bought was about the Far East. The first leading\r\narticle of my journalistic apprenticeship in London was about Korea.\r\nWhen I left daily journalism, at the time of the siege of the Peking\r\nLegations, the first thing I published was a book pleading for a\r\nbetter understanding of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAfter that, as a cottager in Essex, I wrote--above a _nom de guerre_\r\nwhich is better known than I am--a dozen volumes on rural subjects.\r\nDuring a visit to the late David Lubin in Rome I noticed in the big\r\nlibrary of his International Institute of Agriculture that there was\r\nno took in English dealing with the agriculture of Japan.[1] Just\r\nbefore the War the thoughts of forward-looking students of our home\r\naffairs ran strongly on the relation of intelligently managed small\r\nholdings to skilled capitalist farming.[2] During the early \"business\r\nas usual\" period of the War, when no tasks had been found for men over\r\nmilitary age--Mr. Wells's protest will be remembered--it occurred to\r\nme that it might be serviceable if I could have ready, for the period\r\nof rural reconstruction and readjustment of our international ideas\r\nwhen the War was over, two books of a new sort. One should be a\r\nstimulating volume on Japan, based on a study, more sociological than\r\ntechnically agricultural, of its remarkable small-farming system and\r\nrural life, and the other a complementary American volume based on a\r\nstudy of the enterprising large farming of the Middle West. I proposed\r\nto write the second book in co-operation with a veteran rural reformer\r\nwho had often invited me to visit him in Iowa, the father of the\r\npresent American Minister of Agriculture. Early in 1915 I set out for\r\nJapan to enter upon the first part of my task. Mr. Wallace died while\r\nI was still in Japan, and the Middle West book remains to be\r\nundertaken by someone else.\r\n\r\nThe Land of the Rising Sun has been fortunate in the quality of the\r\nbooks which many foreigners have written.[3] But for every work at the\r\nstandard of what might be called the seven \"M's\"--Mitford, Murdoch,\r\nMunro, Morse, Maclaren, \"Murray\" and McGovern--there are many volumes\r\nof fervid \"pro-Japanese\" or determined \"anti-Japanese\" romanticism.\r\nThe pictures of Japan which such easily perused books present are\r\nincredible to readers of ordinary insight or historical imagination,\r\nbut they have had their part in forming public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe basic fact about Japan is that it is an agricultural country.\r\nJapanese æstheticism, the victorious Japanese army and navy, the\r\nsmoking chimneys of Osaka, the pushing mercantile marine, the\r\nParliamentary and administrative developments of Tokyo and a costly\r\nworldwide diplomacy are all borne on the bent backs of _Ohyakusho no\r\nFufu_,[4] the Japanese peasant farmer and his wife. The depositories\r\nof the authentic _Yamato damashii_ (Japanese spirit) are to be found\r\nknee deep in the sludge of their paddy fields.\r\n\r\nOne book about Japan may well be written in the perspective of the\r\nvillage and the hamlet. There it is possible to find the way beneath\r\nthat surface of things visible to the tourist. There it is possible to\r\ndiscover the _foundations_ of the Japan which is intent on cutting\r\nsuch a figure in the East and in the West. There it is possible to\r\nlearn not only what Japan is but what she may have it in her to\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nA rural sociologist is not primarily interested in the technique of\r\nagriculture. He conceives agriculture and country life as Arthur Young\r\nand Cobbett did, as a means to an end, the sound basis, the touchstone\r\nof a healthy State. I was helped in Japan not only by my close\r\nacquaintance with the rural civilisation of two pre-eminently\r\nsmall-holdings countries, Holland and Denmark, but by what I knew to\r\nbe precious in the rural life of my own land.\r\n\r\nAn interest in rural problems cannot be simulated. As I journeyed\r\nabout the country the sincerity of my purpose--there are few words in\r\ncommoner use in the Far East than sincerity--was recognised and\r\nappreciated. I enjoyed conversations in which customary barriers had\r\nbeen broken down and those who spoke said what they felt. We\r\ninevitably discussed not only agricultural economy but life, religion\r\nand morality, and the way Japan was taking.\r\n\r\nI spoke and slept in Buddhist temples. I was received at Shinto\r\nshrines. I was led before domestic altars. I was taken to gatherings\r\nof native Christians. I planted commemorative trees until more\r\npersimmons than I can ever gather await my return to Japan. I wrote so\r\nmany _gaku_[5] for school walls and for my kind hosts that my memory\r\nwas drained of maxims. I attended guileless horse-races. I was present\r\nat agricultural shows, fairs, wrestling matches, _Bon_ dances, village\r\nand county councils and the strangest of public meetings. I talked not\r\nonly with farmers and their families but with all kinds of landlords,\r\nwith schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, policemen, shopkeepers,\r\npriests, co-operative society enthusiasts, village officials, county\r\nofficials, prefectural officials, a score of Governors and an Ainu\r\nchief. I sought wisdom from Ministers of State and nobles of every\r\nrank, from the Prince who is the heir of the last of the Shoguns down\r\nto democratic Barons who prefer to be called \"Mr.\", I chatted with\r\nfarmers' wives and daughters, I interrogated landladies and mill\r\ngirls, and I paid a memorable visit to a Buddhist nunnery. I walked,\r\ntalked, rode, ate and bathed with common folk and with dignitaries. I\r\ndiscussed the situation of Japan with the new countryman in college\r\nagricultural laboratories and classrooms, and, in a remote region,\r\nbeheld what is rare nowadays, the old countryman kneeling before his\r\ncottage with his head to the ground as the stranger rode past.\r\n\r\nI made notes as I traversed paddy-field paths, by mountain ways, in\r\ncolleges, schools, houses and inns. It can only have been when\r\ncrossing water on men's backs that I did not make notes. I jotted\r\nthings down as I walked, as I sat, as I knelt, as I lay on my _futon_,\r\nas I journeyed in _kuruma_, on horseback, in jolting _basha_, in\r\nautomobiles, in shaking cross-country trains and in boats; in\r\nbrilliant sunshine and sweltering heat, in the shade and in dust; in\r\nthe early morning with chilled fingers or more or less furtively as I\r\ncrouched at protracted private or official repasts, or late at night\r\nendeavoured to gather crumbs from the wearing conversation of polite\r\ncallers who, though set on helping me, did not always find it easy to\r\nunderstand the kind of information of which I was in search. One of\r\nthese asked my travelling companion _sotto voce_, \"Is he after metal\r\nmines?\"\r\n\r\nI went on my own trips and on routes planned out for me by\r\nagricultural and social zealots, and from time to time I returned\r\nphysically and mentally fatigued to my little Japanese house near\r\nTokyo to rest and to write out from my memoranda, to seek data for new\r\ndistricts from the obliging Department of Agriculture and the\r\nAgricultural College people at the Imperial University, and to eat and\r\ndrink with rural authorities who chanced to be visiting the capital\r\nfrom distant prefectures. I had many setbacks. I was misinformed, now\r\nand then intentionally and often unintentionally. There were many days\r\nwhich were not only harassing but seemingly wasted. I often despaired\r\nof achieving results worth all the exertion I was making and the money\r\nI was spending. I must have worn to shreds the patience of some\r\nEnglish-speaking Japanese friends, but they never owned defeat. In the\r\nend I found that I made progress.\r\n\r\nBut so did the War, which when I set out from London few believed\r\nwould last long. I was troubled by continually meeting with incredible\r\nignorance about the War, the issues at stake and the certain end. The\r\nJapanese who talked with me were 10,000 miles away from the fighting.\r\nJapan had nothing to lose, everything indeed to gain from the\r\nabatement of Europe's activities in Asia. Not only Japanese soldiers\r\nbut many administrative, educational, agricultural and commercial\r\nexperts had been to school in Germany. There was much in common in the\r\nGerman and Japanese mentalities, much alike in Central European and\r\nFarthest East regard for the army and for order, devotion to\r\nregulations, habit of subordination and deification of the State.\r\nEventually the well-known anti-Ally campaign broke out in Tokyo, a\r\nthing which has never been sufficiently explained. Soon I was pressed\r\nto turn aside from my studies and attempt the more immediately useful\r\ntask: to explain why Western nations, whose manifest interests were\r\npeace, were resolutely squandering their blood and wealth in War.\r\n\r\nIf what I published had some measure of success,[6] it was because by\r\nthis time, unlike some of the critics who sharply upbraided Japan and\r\nmade impossible proposals in impossible terms, I had learnt something\r\nat first hand about the Japanese, because I wrote of the difficulties\r\nas well as the faults of Japan, and because I was now a little known\r\nas her well-wisher. One of the two books I published was translated as\r\na labour of love, as I shall never forget, by a Japanese public man\r\nwhose leisure was so scant that he sat up two nights to get his\r\nmanuscript finished. Before long I had involved myself in the arduous\r\ntask of founding and of editing for two years a monthly review, _The\r\nNew East (Shin Toyo)_,[7] with for motto a sentence of my own which\r\nexpresses what wisdom I have gained about the Orient, _The real\r\nbarrier between East and West is a distrust of each other's morality\r\nand the illusion that the distrust is on one side only._\r\n\r\nThe excuse for so personal a digression is that, when this period of\r\nliterary and journalistic stress began, my rural notebooks and MSS.,\r\nmemoranda of conversations on social problems and a heterogeneous\r\ncollection of reports and documents had to be stowed into boxes. There\r\nthey stayed until a year ago. The entries in a dozen of my little\r\nhurriedly filled notebooks have lost their flavour or are\r\nunintelligible: I have put them all aside. Neither is it possible to\r\nutilise notes which were submarined or lost in over-worked post\r\noffices. This book--I have had to leave out Kyushu entirely--is not\r\nthe work I planned, a complete account of rural life and industry in\r\nevery part of Japan, with an excursus on Korea and Formosa, and\r\ncertain general conclusions: a standard work, no doubt, in, I am\r\nafraid, two volumes, and forgetful at times of the warning that \"to\r\nspend too much Time in Studies is Sloth.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I had transcribed before leaving Japan I have now been able in\r\nthe course of a leisured year in England to overhaul and to supplement\r\nby up-to-date statistics in an extensive Appendix. In the changed\r\ncircumstances in which the book is completed I have also ruthlessly\r\ntransferred to this Appendix all the technical matter in the text, so\r\nthat nothing shall obstruct the way of the general reader. At some\r\nfuture date there may be by another hand a book about Japan in terms\r\nof soils, manures and crops. That is the book the War saved me from\r\nwriting. In the present work I have the opportunity which so few\r\nauthors have enjoyed of jettisoning all technics into an Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shin Koron_\r\n\"BYGONE DAYS IN JAPAN\" IS THE TITLE OF THIS CARTOON]\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary,\" says a wise modern author, \"to meditate over one's\r\nimpressions at leisure, to start afresh again and again with a clearer\r\nvision of the essential facts.\" And a Japanese companion of my\r\njourneys writes, \"Never can you be sorry that this book is coming\r\nlate. This time of delay has been the best time; we have had enough\r\nof first impressions.\" The justification for this volume is that, in\r\nspite of the difficulties attending the composition of it, it may be\r\nheld to offer a picture of some aspects of modern Japan to be found\r\nnowhere else. Politics is not for these pages, nor, because there are\r\nso many charming books on æsthetic and scenic Japan, do I write on Art\r\nor about Fuji, Kyoto, Nara, Miyanoshita and Nikko. I went to Japan to\r\nsee the countryman. The Japanese whom most of the world knows are\r\ntownified, sometimes Americanised or Europeanised, and, as often as\r\nnot, elaborately educated. They are frequently remarkable men. They\r\nstand for a great deal in modern Japan. But their untownified\r\nfellow-countrymen, with the training of tradition and experience, of\r\nrural schoolmasters and village elders, and, as frequently, of the\r\ncarefully shielded army, are more than half of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhat is their health of mind and body? By what social and moral\r\nprinciples and prejudices are they swayed? To what extent are they\r\nadequate to the demand that is made and is likely to be made upon\r\nthem? In what respects are they the masters of their lives or are\r\nmastered? In what ways are they still open to Western influences? And\r\nin what directions are they now inclined to trust to \"themselves\r\nalone\"?\r\n\r\nIf the masters of the rural journal were sometimes mistaken in the\r\nobservations they made from horseback, I cannot have escaped\r\nblundering in passing through more dimly lit scenes than they visited.\r\n\"If there appears here and there any uncorrectness, I do not hold\r\nmyself obliged to answer for what I could not perfectly govern.\"[8]\r\nBut I have laboriously taken all the precautions I could and I have\r\nobeyed as far as possible a recent request that \"visitors to the Far\r\nEast should confine themselves to what they have seen with their own\r\neyes.\" As Huxley wrote, \"all that I have proposed to myself is to say,\r\nThis and this have I learned.\"\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in recalling that some years ago I was approached with\r\na view to undertaking for the United States Government a\r\nsocio-agricultural investigation in a foreign country. Reared as I\r\nhave been in the whole faith of a citizen of the English-speaking\r\nworld, I am glad to think that the present volume may be of some\r\nservice to American readers. The United States is within ten\r\ndays--Canada is within nine--of Japan against Great Britain's month by\r\nthe Atlantic-C.P.R.-Pacific route and eight weeks by Suez. There are\r\nmore American visitors than British to Japan. It was America that\r\nfirst opened Japan to the West, and the debt of Japan to American\r\ntraining and stimulus is immense. But British services to Japan have\r\nalso been substantial. Great Britain was the first to welcome her\r\nwithin the circle of the Great Powers, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance\r\ndid more for Japan than some Japanese have been willing to admit. The\r\nproblem of Japan is the problem of the whole English-speaking world.\r\nRightly conceived, the interests of the British Empire and the United\r\nStates in the Far East are one and indivisible.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese version of the title of this book (kindly suggested by\r\nMr. Seichi Narusé) is _Nihon no Shinzui_, literally, \"The Marrow\" or\r\n\"The Core of Japan.\" His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador, the\r\nbeauty of whose calligraphy is well known, was so very kind as to\r\nallow me to requisition his clever brush for the script for the\r\nengraver; but it must be understood that Baron Hayashi has seen\r\nnothing of the volume but the cover.\r\n\r\nI greatly regret that the present conditions of book production make\r\nit impossible to reproduce more than one in thirty of my photographs.\r\n\r\nIt is in no spirit of ingratitude to my hosts and many other kind\r\npeople in Japan that I have taken the decision resolutely to strike\r\nout of the text all those names of places and persons which give such\r\na forbidding air to a traveller's page. I have pleasure in\r\nacknowledging here the particular obligations I am under to Kunio\r\nYanaghita, formerly Secretary of the Japanese House of Peers and a\r\ndistinguished and disinterested student of rural conditions, Dr.\r\nNitobe, assistant secretary of the League of Nations, and his wife,\r\nProfessor Nasu, Imperial University, Mr. Yamasaki, Mr. M. Yanagi, Mr.\r\nKanzō Uchimura, Mr. Bernard Leach, Mr. M. Tajima, Mr. Ono and two\r\nyoung officials in Hokkaido, who each in turn found time to join me on\r\nmy journeys and showed me innumerable kindnesses. It was a piece of\r\ngood fortune that while these pages were in preparation Mr. Yanaghita,\r\nProfessor Nasu and other fellow-travellers were in Europe and\r\navailable for consultation. Professor Nasu unweariedly furnished\r\npainstaking answers to many questions, and was kind enough to read all\r\nof the book in proof; but he has no responsibility, of course, for the\r\nviews which I express. I am also specially indebted to Dr. Kozai,\r\nPresident of the Imperial University, to Mr. Ito and other officials\r\nof the Ministry of Agriculture, to Mr. Tsurimi, one of the most\r\nunderstanding of travelled Japanese, to Mr. Iwanaga, formerly of the\r\nImperial Railway Board, to Dr. Sato, President of Hokkaido University,\r\nand his obliging colleagues, to the Imperial Agricultural Society, to\r\nProfessors Yahagi and Yokoi, and to Viscount Kano, Dr. Kuwada, Mr. I.\r\nYoshida, Mr. K. Ohta, Mr. H. Saito, Mr. S. Hoshijima, and many\r\nprovincial agricultural and sociological experts.\r\n\r\nPortions of drafts for this book have appeared in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph, World's Work, Manchester Guardian, New East, Asia, Japan\r\nChronicle_ and _Christian World_. I am indebted to the _World's Work_\r\nand _Asia_ for some additional illustrations from blocks made from my\r\nphotographs, and to the _New East_ for some sketches by Miss Elizabeth\r\nKeith.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] There is a small book by an able American soil specialist, the\r\nlate Professor King, which describes through rose-tinted glasses the\r\nfarming of Japan, and of China and Korea as well, on the basis of a\r\nflying trip to countries the population of which is thrice that of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States together. The author of another\r\nbook, published last year, delivers himself of this astonishing\r\nopinion: \"The Japanese is no better fitted to direct his own\r\nagriculture than I am to steer a rudderless ship across the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n[2] _Vide_ Sir Daniel Hall's _Pilgrimage of English Farming_ and\r\narticles of mine in the _Nineteenth Century_ and _Times_, and my _Land\r\nProblem_.\r\n\r\n[3] The Japanese have only lately, however, made some acknowledgment\r\nof their debt to Hearn, and in an eight-page bibliography of the best\r\nbooks about Japan in the _Japan Year Book_ Murdoch's as yet unrivalled\r\n_History_ is not even mentioned.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ohyakusho_ must not be confused with _Oo-hyakusho_ or\r\n_Oo-byakusho_, which means a large farmer. _O_ is a polite prefix;\r\n_Oo_ or _O_ means large.\r\n\r\n[5] Horizontal wall writings.\r\n\r\n[6] About 35,000 copies of my two bilingual books were circulated.\r\n\r\n[7] With the backing of a London Committee composed of Lord Burnham,\r\nSir G.W.

The War was followed by a\r\nsevere financial crisis. Professor Nasu wrote to me during the summer of\r\n1921:\r\n\r\n\"You are very wise to leave the figures as they stood. It is useless\r\nto try to correct them, because they are still changing. The price of\r\nrice, which did not exceed 15 yen per koku when you were making your\r\nresearch work, exceeded 50 yen in 1919, and is now struggling to\r\nmaintain the price of 25 yen. Taking at 100 the figures for the years\r\n1915 or 1916--fortunately there is not much difference between these\r\ntwo years--the prices of six leading commodities reached in 1919 an\r\naverage of about 250. After 1919 the prices of some commodities went\r\nstill higher, but mostly they did not change very much; on the other\r\nhand, recently the prices of many commodities--among them rice and raw\r\nsilk especially--have been coming down and this downward movement is\r\ngradually extending to all other commodities. From these\r\nconsiderations I deduce that the index number of general commodities\r\nmay be safely taken as 200 when your book appears. _The reader of your\r\nbook has simply to double the figures given by you--that is the\r\nfigures of_ 1915 _and_ 1916--_in order to get a rough estimate of\r\npresent prices._\"\r\n\r\nWhere exact statements of area and yield are necessary, as in the\r\nstudy of the intense agriculture of Japan, local measures are\r\npreferable to our equivalents in awkward fractions. Further, the\r\nmeasures used in this book are easily remembered, and no serious study\r\nof Japanese agriculture on the spot is possible without remembering\r\nthem. While, however, Japanese currency, weights and measures have\r\nbeen uniformly used, equivalents have been supplied at every place in\r\nthe book where their omission might be reasonably considered to\r\ninterfere with easy reading. The following tables are restricted to\r\ncurrency, weights and measures mentioned in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONEY[9]\r\n\r\n_Yen_ = roughly (at the time notes for the book were made) a florin or half\r\na dollar = 100 sen.\r\n\r\n_Sen_ = a farthing or half cent = 10 rin.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG\r\n\r\n_Ri_ = roughly 2-1/2 miles.\r\n\r\n_Shaku_ (roughly 1 ft.) = 11.93 in.\r\n\r\nRi are converted into miles by being multiplied by 2.44.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUARE\r\n\r\n_Ri_ (roughly 6 sq. miles) = 5.955 sq. miles.\r\n\r\n_Chō_ (sometimes written, _Chōbu_) (roughly 2-1/2 acres) = 2.450 acres =\r\n10 tan = 3,000 tsubo.\r\n\r\n_Tan_ or _Tambu_ (roughly 1/4 acre) = 0.245 acres = 10 se = 300 bu.\r\n\r\n_Bu_ or _Tsubo_ (roughly 4 sq. yds.) = 3.953 sq. yds.\r\n\r\nAn acre is about 4 tan 10 bu or 1,200 bu or tsubo (an urban measure).\r\nThe size of rooms is reckoned by the number of mats, which are ordinarily\r\n6 shaku in length and 3 shaku in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPACITY\r\n\r\n_Koku_ (roughly 40 gals, or 5 bush.) = 39.703 gals, or 4.960 bush. =\r\n10 tō. According to American measurements, there are 47.653 gals,\r\n(liquid) and 5.119 bush, (dry) in a koku. A koku of rice is 313-1/2 lbs.\r\n(British).\r\n\r\nA koku of imported rice is, however, 330-1/2 lbs. The following koku must\r\nalso be noted: ordinary barley, 231 lbs.; naked barley 301.1 lbs.; wheat\r\n288.7 lbs.; proso millet, 247.9 lbs.; foxtail millet, 280.9 lbs.; barnyard\r\nmillet, 165.2 lbs.; brickaheat, 247.9 lbs.; maize, 289.2 lbs.; soya beans,\r\n286.5 lbs.; azuki (red) beans, 319.9 lbs.; horse beans, 266.6 lbs.; peas,\r\n306.5 lbs.\r\n\r\n_Hyō_ (roughly 2 bush.) = 1.985 bush. = 4 tō = bale of rice.\r\n\r\n_Tō_ (roughly 4 gals, or 1/2 bush.) = 3.970 gals, or .496 bush, or\r\n1.985 pecks = 10 shō.\r\n\r\n_Shō_ (roughly 1-1/2 qts.) = 1.588 qts. or 0.198 pecks or 108-1/2\r\ncub. in. = 10 gō.\r\n\r\n_Gō_ (roughly 1/3 pint) =.3176 pints or 0.019 pecks.\r\n\r\nRice is not bagged but baled, and a bale is 4 tō or 1 hyō.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT\r\n\r\n_Kwan_ or _kwamme_ (roughly 8-1/4 lbs.) = 8.267 lbs. av. or 10.047 lbs.\r\ntroy = 1,000 momme.\r\n\r\n_Kin_ (catty) = 1.322 lbs. av. or 1.607 troy = 160 momme.\r\n\r\n_Momme_ = 2.116 drams or 2.411 dwts. According to American measurements\r\na momme is 0.132 oz. av. and 0.120 oz. troy.\r\n\r\n_Hyakkin_ (_picul_) = 100 kin = 132.277 lbs.\r\n\r\nA stone is 1.693, a cwt. is 13.547, and a ton 270.950 kwamme.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE TERMS\r\n\r\n_Ken_.--Prefecture. There are forty-three ken and Hokkaido. Ken\r\nand fu are made up of the former sixty-six provinces. Sometimes the name\r\nof the ken and the name of the capital of the ken are the same: example,\r\nShidzuoka-ken, capital Shidzuoka.\r\n\r\n_Fu_.--Three prefectures are municipal prefectures and are called not\r\nken but fu. They are Tokyo-fu, Kyoto-fu and Osaka-fu.\r\n\r\n_Gun_ (_kōri_).--Division of a prefecture, a county or rural district.\r\nThere are 636 gun. Gun are now being done away with.\r\n\r\n_Shi_.--City. There are seventy-nine cities.\r\n\r\n_Cho_.--A town or rather a district preponderatingly urban. There are\r\n1,333 cho.\r\n\r\n_Machi_.--Japanese name for the Chinese character cho.\r\n\r\n_Son_.--A village or rather a district preponderatingly rural. There are\r\n10,839 son.\r\n\r\n_Mura_.--Japanese name for a Chinese character son.\r\n\r\nA true idea of the Japanese village is obtained as soon as one mentally\r\ndefines it as a commune. There may be a rural community called son\r\nor a municipal community called cho. The cho or son consists of a number of\r\noaza, that is, big aza, which in turn consists of a number of ko-aza or\r\nsmall aza. A ko-aza may consist of twenty or thirty dwellings, that is,\r\na hamlet, or it may be only one dwelling. It may be ten acres in extent\r\nor fifty. I found that the population of a particular municipality was\r\n10,000 in seven big oaza comprising twenty-two ko-aza.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROOM, OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC, IN WHICH MUCH OF\r\nTHIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN\r\nThe feet of the chair and table are fitted with wooden slats so as not\r\nto injure the _tatami_.

Emotion and sentiment are, after all, incomparably\r\nmore solid than any statistics. So that when one wanders back in\r\nmemory through the field one has traversed in diligent search of hard\r\nfacts, one comes back bearing in one's arms a Sheaf of\r\nFeelings.--HAVELOCK ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day as I walked along a narrow path between rice fields in a\r\nremote district in Japan, I saw a Buddhist priest coming my way. He\r\nwas rosy-faced and benign, broad-shouldered and a little rotund. He\r\nhad with him a string of small children. I stood by to let him pass\r\nand lifted my hat. He bowed and stopped, and we entered into\r\nconversation. He told me that he was taking the children to a\r\nfestival. I said that I should like to meet him again. He offered to\r\ncome to see me in the evening at my host's house. When he arrived, and\r\nI asked him, after a little polite talk, what was the chief difficulty\r\nin the way of improving the moral condition of his village, he\r\nanswered, \"I am.\"\r\n\r\nWe spoke of Buddhism, and he complained that its sects were \"too\r\naristocratic.\" When his own sect of Buddhism, Shinshu, was started, he\r\nsaid, it was something \"quite democratic for the common people.\" But\r\nwith the lapse of time this democratic sect had also \"become\r\naristocratic.\" \"Though the founder of Shinshu wore flaxen clothing,\r\nShinshu priests now have glittering costumes. And everyone has heard\r\nof the magnificence of the Kyoto Hongwanji\" (the great temple at\r\nKyoto, the headquarters of the sect).[11] \"Contrary to the principles\r\nof religion and democracy,\" people thought of the priest and the\r\ntemple \"as something beyond their own lives.\" All this stood in the\r\nway of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe fashion in which many landowners \"despised exertion and lived\r\nluxuriously\" was another hindrance. These men looked down on\r\neducation, \"thinking themselves clever because they read the\r\nnewspapers.\" Landlords of this sort were fond of curios, and kept\r\ntheir capital in such things instead of in agriculture. Sellers of\r\ncurios visited the village too often. A wise man had called the\r\ncurio-seller the \"Spirit of Poverty\" (_Bimbogami_). He said that the\r\nSpirit visited a man when he became rich--in order to bring curios to\r\nhim; and again when he became poor--in order to take them away from\r\nhim! After he became poor the Spirit of Poverty never visited him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nYet another drawback to rural progress was petty political ambition.\r\nPeople slandered neighbours who belonged to another party and they\r\nwould not associate with them. Such party feeling was one of the bad\r\ninfluences of civilisation.\r\n\r\nFurther, \"a mercenary spirit and materialism\" had to be fought in the\r\nvillage. There was not, however, much trouble due to drink, and there\r\nwas no gambling now. There might still be impropriety between young\r\npeople--formerly young men used to visit the factory girls--but it was\r\nrare. Lately there had been land speculation, and some of those who\r\nmade money went to tea-houses to see geisha.\r\n\r\nThere was in the neighbourhood, this Buddhist pastor went on, a temple\r\nbelonging to the same sect as his own, and he was on friendly terms\r\nwith its priest. It was good discipline, he said, for two priests to\r\nbe working near one another if they were of the same sect, for their\r\nwork was compared. In answer to my enquiry, the old man said that he\r\npreached four days a month. Each service consisted of reading for an\r\nhour and then preaching for two hours. About 150 or 200 persons would\r\nattend. He had also a service every morning from five to six. In\r\naddition to these gatherings in the temple he conducted services in\r\nfarmers' houses. \"I feel rather ashamed sometimes,\" he said, \"when I\r\nlisten to the good sermons of Christians.\"\r\n\r\nAs the priest was taking leave he told me that he was going to a\r\nfarmer's house in order to conduct a service. I asked to be allowed to\r\naccompany him. He kindly agreed, and invited me to stay the night in\r\nhis temple.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the farmhouse there were there about two dozen kneeling\r\npeople, including members of the family. On the coming of the priest,\r\nwho had gone to the temple to put on his robes, the farmer threw open\r\nthe doors of the family shrine and lighted the candles in it. The\r\npriest knelt down by the shrine and invited me to kneel near him. In a\r\nfew words he told the people why I was in the district. Whereupon the\r\nfarmer's aged mother piped, \"We heard that a tall man had come, but to\r\nthink that we should see him and be in the same room with him!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had prayed, the priest read from a roll of the Shinshu\r\nscripture which he had taken reverently from a box and a succession of\r\nwrappings. Afterwards he preached from a \"text,\" continuing, of\r\ncourse, to kneel as we did. A flickering light fell upon us from a\r\nlamp hanging from a beam. The room was pervaded with incense from an\r\niron censer which the farmer gently swung. The worshippers told their\r\nbeads, and in intervals between the priest's sentences I heard the\r\nmurmur of fervent prayer. The priest preached his sermon with his eyes\r\nshut, and I could watch him narrowly. It is not so often that one sees\r\nan old man with a sweet face. But there was sweetness in both the face\r\nand voice of this priest. He spoke slowly and clearly, sometimes\r\npausing for a little between his sentences as if for better\r\ninspiration, as a Quaker will sometimes do in speaking at meeting. His\r\ntones were no higher than could be heard clearly in the room. There\r\nwas nothing of the exhorter in this man. His talk did not sound like\r\npreaching at all. It was like kind, friendly talk at the fireside at a\r\nsolemn time. \"Faith, prayer, morality: these alone are necessary,\" was\r\nthe burden of the simple address. \"We have faith by divine providence;\r\nout of our thanksgiving comes prayer, and we cannot but be good.\" It\r\nwas plain that the old women loved their priest. In the front of the\r\ncongregation were three crones gnarled in hands and face. When the\r\nsermon of an hour or so came to an end they spoke quaveringly of the\r\nmercy of Buddha to them, and of their own feebleness to do well. The\r\nold priest gently offered them comfort and counsel.\r\n\r\nAfter the service, in the light of the priest's paper lantern, I made\r\nmy way along the road to the temple. At length I found myself mounting\r\nthe lichened stone steps to the great closed gates. The priest drew\r\nthe long wooden bolt and pushed one gate creakingly back. We went by a\r\npaved pathway into the deeper shadow of the temple. Then a light\r\nglowed from the side of the building, and we were in the priest's\r\nhouse. It was like a farmer's house only more refined in detail.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past four in the morning I was awakened by the booming of\r\nthe temple bell. It is the sound which of all delights in the Far East\r\nis most memorable. I got up, and, following the example of my host,\r\nhad a bath in the open, and dressed.\r\n\r\nThen I was lighted along passages into the public part of the temple.\r\nThe priest with an acolyte began service at the middle altar.\r\nAfterwards he proceeded to a side altar. At one stage of the service\r\nhe chanted a hymn which ran something like this:\r\n\r\nFrom the virtues and the mercies of divine providence we\r\n    get faith, the worth of which is boundless.\r\nThe ice of petty care and trouble which froze our hearts\r\n    is melted.\r\nIt has become the water of divine illumination, bearing\r\n    us on to peace.\r\nThe more care and trouble, the greater the illumination\r\n    and the reward.\r\n\r\nI knelt on the outside of the congregational group. It was cold as\r\nthe great doors were slid open from time to time and the kneeling\r\nfigures grew in number to about forty. Day broke and a few sparrows\r\ntwittered by the time the first part of the service was over.\r\n\r\nThe priest then took up his lamp and low table, and, coming without\r\nthe altar rail, knelt down in the midst of the congregation. In this\r\nfamiliar relation with his people he delivered a homily in a\r\nconversational tone. Buddha was to mankind as a father to his\r\nchildren, he said. If a man did bad things but repented, his father\r\nwould be more delighted than if he got rich. The way of serving Buddha\r\nwas to feel his love. To ask of the rich or of a master was\r\nsupplication, but we did not need to supplicate Buddha. Our love of\r\nBuddha and his love for us would become one thing. Carelessness, an\r\nevil spirit, doubt: these were the enemies. Gold was beautiful to look\r\nat, but if the gold stuck in one's eyes so that one could not see, how\r\nthen? The true essence of belief was the abandonment of ourselves to\r\ndivine providence.\r\n\r\nSo the speaker went on, pressing home his thoughts with anecdote or\r\nlegend. There was the tale of a woman whose character benefited when\r\nher husband became a leper. Another story was of an injured lizard\r\nwhich was fed for many days by its mate. We were also told of a\r\nmischievous fellow who tried to anger a believer. The ne'er-do-weel\r\nwent to the man's house and called him a liar. The believer thanked\r\nhim for his faithful dealing, and said that it might be true that he\r\nwas a liar. He would be glad, he said, to be given further advice\r\nafter his wife had warmed water in order that his visitor might wash\r\nhis feet. \"The mind of the vagabond was thereupon changed.\"\r\n\r\nThe rays of light from the lamp illumined the large Buddha-like shaven\r\nhead and mild countenance of the priest and the labour-worn faces of\r\nhis flock around him. Two weatherbeaten men curiously resembled\r\nHighland elders. I saw that they, an old woman and a young mother with\r\na child tied on her back kept their eyes fixed on the preacher. It was\r\nplain that in the service they found strength for the day.\r\n\r\nI was in a reverie when the priest ended his talk. To my\r\nembarrassment he begged me to come with him within the altar rail and\r\nspeak to the people. I had been quickened to such a degree by the\r\nexperience of the previous night and by this service at dawn that I\r\nstood up at once. But there seemed to be not one word at my call, and\r\nmy knees knocked because of cold and shyness. I grasped the chilly\r\nbrass altar rail, and, as I met the gaze of friendly, sun-tanned,\r\ncare-rutted alien faces, which yet had the look of \"kent folk,\" I\r\nmarvellously found sentence following sentence. What I said matters\r\nnothing. What I felt was the unity of all religion, my veneration for\r\nthis rare priest, a sense of kinship with these worshippers of another\r\nrace and faith, and a realisation of the elemental things which lie at\r\nthe basis of international understanding. Several old men and women\r\ncame up to me and bowed and made little speeches of kindness and\r\ncordiality. Six was striking on a clock in the priest's house as the\r\ndoors of the temple were slid open, the great cryptomeria[12] which\r\nguard the village fane stood forth augustly in the morning light, and\r\nthe congregation went out to its labour.\r\n\r\nAs I knelt at breakfast and ate my rice and pickles and drank my\r\n_miso_ soup,[13] the priest, after the manner of a Japanese with an\r\nhonoured guest, did not take food but waited upon me. He asked if the\r\nEnglish clergy wore a costume which marked them off from the people.\r\nHe liked the way of some of our preachers who wore ordinary clothes\r\nand eschewed the title of \"reverend.\" He was also taken by the idea of\r\nthe Quaker meeting at which there is silence until someone feels he\r\nhas a message to utter. As to the future of Buddhism, he deeply\r\nregretted to say that many priests were a generation behind the age.\r\nIf the priests were \"more democratic, better educated and more truly\r\nreligious,\" then they might be able to keep hold of young men. He knew\r\nof one priest in Tokyo who had a dormitory for university students.\r\n\r\nThe priest presented his wife, a kindly woman full of character. \"This\r\nis my wife,\" he said; \"please teach her.\" I spoke of a kind of\r\nkindergarten which I had learnt had been conducted at the temple for\r\nfive years. \"We merely play with the children,\" she said. \"I had the\r\nplan of it from the kindergarten of a missionary,\" her husband added.\r\nThe priest and his wife were kneeling side by side in the still\r\ntemple-room looking out on their restful garden. Behind them was a\r\nscreen the inscription on which might be translated, \"We are to be\r\nthankful for our environment; we are to become content quite naturally\r\nby the gracious influence of the universe and by the strength of our\r\nown will.\"\r\n\r\nI could learn nothing from the priest concerning several helpful\r\norganisations which I had heard that the villagers owed to his\r\ninfluence and exertions. But the manager of the village agricultural\r\nassociation told me that for a quarter of a century Otera San (Mr.\r\nTemple) had superintended the education of the young people, that\r\nunder his guidance the village had a seven years' old co-operative\r\ncredit and selling society, 294 families belonged to a poultry\r\nsociety, 320 men and women gathered to study the doctrines of Ninomiya\r\n(whom we in the West know from a little book by a late Japanese\r\nAmbassador in London, called _For His People_), and the young men's\r\nassociation performed its discipline at half-past five in the morning\r\nin the winter and at four o'clock in the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"TO ROUSE THE VILLAGE YOU MUST FIRST ROUSE THE PRIEST\"\r\n(Autograph of Otera San)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Exchange in 1916; in 1921 the yen is worth 2s. 8d.\r\n\r\n[10] The chapters in this section are based on notes of several visits\r\npaid to Aichi, which is in the middle of Japan, and agriculturally and\r\nsocially one of the most interesting of the prefectures. It is three\r\nprefectures distant from Tokyo.\r\n\r\n[11] Throughout this book an attempt has been made to preserve in\r\ntranslation something of the character of the Japanese phraseology.\r\n\r\n[12] _Cryptomeria japonica_, or in Japanese, _sugi_, allied to the\r\nsequoia, yew and cypress.\r\n\r\n[13] _Miso_, bean paste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\"GOOD PEOPLE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PRECAUTIOUS\"\r\n\r\nJe ne propose rien, je n'impose rien, j'expose.--_De la liberté du travail_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had been through Tokyo University, but his hands were rough with\r\nthe work of the rice fields. \"I resent the fact that a farmer is\r\nconsidered to be socially inferior to a townsman,\" he said. \"I am\r\ngoing to show that the income of a farmer who is diligent and skilful\r\nmay equal that of a Minister of State. I also propose to build a fine\r\nhouse, not out of vanity, but in order to show that an honest farmer\r\ncan do as well for himself as a townsman.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the speaker to tell me something about himself he went\r\non: \"My father was a follower of a pupil of the great Ninomiya.\r\nSchools of frugal living and high ideals were common in the Tokugawa\r\nperiod.[14] The object sought was the education of heart and spirit.\r\nAt night when I was in bed my father used to kneel by me,[15] his\r\neldest son, and say, 'When you grow big you must become a great man\r\nand distinguish our family name.' This instruction was given to me\r\nrepeatedly and it went deeply into my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I became a young man,\" he continued, \"I had two friends. We made\r\npromises to each other. One said, 'I will become the greatest scholar\r\nin Japan.' The second said, 'I will become the greatest statesman.'\r\nThe third, myself, said, 'I will be the greatest rice grower in this\r\ncountry.' If we all succeeded we were to build beautiful houses and\r\ninvite each other to them.\r\n\r\n\"I did not graduate at the University because, by the entreaty of my\r\nfather, when I reached twenty-one, I left Tokyo in order to become a\r\npractical farmer. It is twenty-one years since I began farming. I\r\nconsulted with skilful agriculturists and then I saw my way to make a\r\nplan. Rice in my native place is inferior. I improved it for three or\r\nfour years. I gained the first gold prize at the prefectural show.\r\nSome years later I obtained the first prize at the exhibition which\r\nwas held by five prefectures together. Later still I received the\r\nfirst prize at the exhibition for eighteen prefectures, also the first\r\nprize at the exhibition of the National Agricultural Association.\r\nFurther, I was appointed a judge of rice and travelled about.\r\n\r\n\"I consumed a great deal of time in doing this public work. One day I\r\nwas made to think. A collector for a charity said in my hearing that\r\nhe expected larger subscriptions from practical men because though\r\npublic men were esteemed by society their economic power was small. I\r\nat once resolved that before doing any more public work I should put\r\nmyself in a sound financial position.\r\n\r\n\"As I thought over the matter it seemed to me that it was not to be\r\nexpected that a public man should be able to do his really best work\r\nif his financial position were not sound. Again, could he have lasting\r\ninfluence with people in practical affairs if his own practical\r\naffairs were not in good order?[16] At any rate I determined not to go\r\nout to any more exhibitions or lectures except those which were\r\nremunerative, and I resolved to devote myself as my first duty to my\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\"I set to work and managed my land, 3 _chō_ (a _chō_ is 2-1/2 acres),\r\nso as to obtain the gross income of an M.P. [The reader could scarcely\r\nhave a more striking illustration of the intensity with which Japanese\r\nland is cultivated--the average area is under 3 acres per family.] I\r\nam now working about 4 _chō_ (10 acres). Later on I am going to farm 7\r\n_chō_ (15-1/2 acres) and from that I am expecting the income of a\r\nMinister.[17] I have already collected the materials for my villa, for\r\nI am approaching my goal. One of my two friends, who is also forty\r\nyears of age, is a distinguished chemist in the Imperial Agricultural\r\nCollege. My other friend, who is forty-four, is Secretary of the\r\nKorean Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe indomitable experimenter swallowed another cupful of tea and\r\ndeclared that \"in order to be prosperous, all the members of the\r\nfamily must work.\" All the members of his family did work. His wife\r\nwas strong and there were five healthy children. He used the ordinary\r\nfarm implements and his livestock consisted of only a horse and a few\r\nhens. The home farm was five miles from the station. The outlying\r\nfarms were scattered in five villages--\"there are always spendthrift\r\nlazy fellows willing to sell their land.\" \"I have a firm belief,\" the\r\nspeaker added complacently, \"that agriculture is the most honest, the\r\nmost sincere, the most interesting, the most secure and the most\r\nprofitable calling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very often,\" he went on, \"good people are not sufficiently\r\nprecautious\"--I give the excellent word coined by my interpreter.\r\n\"They spend for the public good, and in the end they are left poor.\r\nRenowned, rich families have come to a miserable condition by such\r\naction. What they have done may have been good. But they are reduced\r\nto pauperism and they are laughed at by many persons. People jeer that\r\nthey pretended to do good, yet they could not do good to themselves.\r\nIf all people who work for the public benefit are laughed at at\r\nlast--and many are--it will come to be thought that to work for the\r\npublic benefit is not good. Therefore I think that the man who would\r\nwork for the public good must be careful in his own affairs. He must\r\nnot be a poor man if he is to help public business. However\r\nphilanthropic he may be, if his financial position is not strong he\r\ncannot go on long. He will be stopped on his good way. He cannot help\r\nother people. Therefore I am now gathering wealth for strengthening\r\nmy financial position as a means to attain the higher end.\"\r\n\r\nAs the speaker awaited my judgment on his career, I ventured to\r\nsuggest that gifts, qualities and inspiration which made a man a\r\npublic man did not necessarily equip him for being a great success in\r\nbusiness life. The question was, perhaps, whether the type of man who\r\nwas pre-eminently successful in promoting his own pecuniary interests\r\nwas necessarily the best type of public man. Was the average character\r\nequal to the strain of many years of concentration on money-making to\r\nthe exclusion of public interests? When men emerged from the sphere of\r\nconcentrated money-making, were they worth so very much as public men?\r\nMight not the values of things have altered a little for them? Might\r\nit not have a shrivelling effect on the heart to resist applications\r\nwhich must be refused when the strengthening of one's financial\r\nposition was regarded as the chief object in life?\r\n\r\nAt this point our host, Mr. Yamasaki, the respected principal of the\r\nbig agricultural school of the prefecture and a well-known rural\r\nauthor and speaker, broke in with the ejaculation, \"He has got a\r\nneedle in your head\"--the Japanese equivalent for \"touching the\r\nspot\"--and continued: \"Surely he is right who through his life offers\r\nfreely what he may have as to members of his own family. I give away\r\nmany pamphlets and I have guests. I could save in these directions.\r\nBut I am not doing it. I am content if I can support my family. I gave\r\na savings book to each of my five children. When the boy becomes\r\ntwenty-one he will have enough to finish at the university or start as\r\na small merchant so as not to be a parasite. My girls will be provided\r\nwith enough to furnish the costs of modest marriage. If I did more I\r\nmight perhaps become greedy.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot say that the farmer who had so kindly outlined his life's\r\nprogramme was impressed either by our host's views or by mine, but he\r\ntold us that he now spent 5 per cent. of his income on public\r\npurposes, and that 150 yen received for giving lectures was spent on\r\nbooks and recreation \"for enlarging mind and heart.\" He happened to\r\nmention that, though his family was of the Zen sect of Buddhism, he\r\nwas a Shintoist. It is difficult to believe that a genuine Buddhist\r\ncould have evolved such a life scheme. There is certainly a Shinto\r\nsymbolism in his plan of tree planting before his house. He has set\r\nthere, in the order shown, eleven pines which he named as marked:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE ELEVEN SYMBOLIC TREES WHICH THE FARMER PLANTED\r\nOUTSIDE HIS HOUSE AND THE EVILS (REPRESENTED BY ARROWS)\r\nFROM WHICH THEY ARE SHIELDING HIM]\r\n\r\nThe virtues inscribed on this plan are the guardians of the farmer and\r\nhis family, which is represented in the middle of it. The words behind\r\nthe arrows represent the character of the attacks to which the farmer\r\nconceives himself and his family to be exposed. Courage is imagined as\r\ngoing before and Wisdom as protecting the rear.\r\n\r\nThe talk turned to some advice which had been given to farmers to lay\r\nout \"economic gardens.\" They were to plant no trees but fruit trees.\r\nTo this an old farmer of our company replied: \"If you are too\r\neconomical your children will become mercenary. Some families were too\r\neconomical and cut down beautiful trees, planting instead economical\r\nones. Those families I have seen come to an evil end. The man who\r\nexercises rigid economy may be a good man, but his children can know\r\nlittle of his real motives and must be wrongly influenced by his\r\nconduct.\" We all agreed that there was nowadays too much talk about\r\nmoney-making in rural Japan. \"Even I,\" laughed the owner of the\r\nsymbolic trees, \"planted not persimmons but pines.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] That is, before the Revolution of half a century ago, when the\r\nTokugawa Shogun resigned his powers to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[15] The Japanese bed, _futon_, consists of a soft mattress of cotton\r\nwool, two or three inches thick. It is spread on the floor, which\r\nitself consists of mats of almost the same thickness, 6 ft. long by 3\r\nft. wide.\r\n\r\n[16] Most of the really big men of Australia have left political life\r\nin comparatively impoverished circumstances. Not only did Sir Henry\r\nParkes die poor.

On the\r\nother hand, there is, I trust, no importunate advocacy or tedious\r\nassentation.--MORLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The alarum clocks for waking us at four o'clock in the summer and\r\nfive in the winter\"--it was the chairman of a village Early-Rising\r\nSociety who was speaking to me--are placed at the houses of the\r\nsecretaries, and each member is in turn a secretary. The duty of a\r\nsecretary, when the alarum clock strikes, is to get up and visit the\r\nhouses of all the members allotted to him and to shout for the young\r\nmen until they answer. Each member on rising walks to the house of the\r\nsecretary of his division and writes his name on the record of\r\nattendances. Then the member goes to the shrine, where we fence and\r\nwrestle for a time. At first we thought that if we fenced and wrestled\r\nearly in the morning we should be tired for our work, but we found\r\nthat it was not so.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes a clock gets damaged and does not ring, so a few of us may\r\nbe getting up later that morning. Or a man becomes afraid of sleeping\r\ntoo late, fears his clock is wrong, and gets up at 3 o'clock and then\r\ngoes off to waken members. Hence complaints. Some cunning fellows ask\r\ntheir friends or brothers to write down for them their names on the\r\nlist of attendances. But we find out their deceit by their\r\nhandwriting. It is very difficult to form the habit of early rising,\r\nbecause members are not expected to report at the secretaries' houses\r\non a rainy day. As there is no control over them that day, they are\r\neasy in their minds and sleep on. Thus they break the habit of early\r\nrising that they are forming. Getting up early is necessary not only\r\nbecause it is good to begin work early but because early rising\r\novercomes the habit of gadding about at night which is customary in\r\nmany villages.\r\n\r\n\"You may say that all this is a great deal to ask of young men,\" the\r\nchairman continued. \"But if you ask from them comfortable practices\r\nonly, how can you expect from them a remarkable result? Young men\r\nshould ponder this and be willing to exert themselves.\" Later on it\r\nwas explained to me that it had been found that it took a great deal\r\nof time for the secretaries to call up all the members in the morning\r\nby shouting to them, \"so the secretary obtained bugles; but even the\r\nbugles were not heard everywhere, so they were changed to drums, and\r\nnow five drums go round our village every morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn every village of Japan there is a young men's association, which is\r\nby no means to be confounded with the world-encircling Y.M.C.A.[18]\r\nThe village Y.M.A. of Japan is an institution of some antiquity and it\r\nhas nothing whatever to do with religious effort. One day, when I was\r\nstaying in a rural district, I was invited to a remoter part in order\r\nto see something of the discipline that the members of a group of\r\nyoung men's associations were imposing on themselves. The members of\r\nthis group of Y.M.A. belonged to the branches established in a village\r\nof nineteen _aza_, that is hamlets. This fact, with the further fact\r\nthat the village containing the nineteen _aza_ had four elementary\r\nschools and one higher school, will show that a Japanese village may\r\nbe much larger than a Western one.\r\n\r\nNearly six hundred young men were in the parade. They were dressed\r\nexactly alike in the tight blue calico trousers and kimono of jacket\r\nlength which the Japanese farmer ordinarily wears. Each man had the\r\nusual _obi_ (waist scarf) tied round his kimono, and in the _obi_ was\r\nthrust the small cotton towel which Japanese carry with them\r\neverywhere. The young men wore puttees, _waraji_ (straw sandals) and\r\ncaps. It is only of late that the Japanese worker has taken to wearing\r\nhead-gear, or at any rate head-gear other than he could contrive with\r\nhis towel. The physical condition of the young fellows was good and\r\ntheir evolutions with dummy \"rifles\" were smart and skilful. The\r\nparaders seemed lost in their desire to do their best for their\r\ncredit's sake and their own good. After the first movements, the\r\n\"troops\" with \"rifles\" held as if there were bayonets at the end, made\r\nrushes with loud cries. The secret of this somewhat surprising display\r\nfar away in the heart of Japan was that the work of the young men had\r\nbeen done under the direction of two fit, be-medalled army surgeons,\r\nreserve officers, who were present in order to answer my questions.\r\n\r\nEvery morning half an hour before sunrise these Y.M.A. members\r\nassemble in the grounds of their Shinto shrine or of their school,\r\nwhere they exercise until the sun shows itself. In the evenings after\r\nwork they also fence, wrestle, lift weights and develop their wrists.\r\nThis wrist development is done by two youths grasping a pole, one at\r\neither end, and then trying to rotate it one against the other.\r\n\r\nThe members endeavour to cultivate their minds as well as their\r\nbodies, and they also observe in their dress a self-denying ordinance.\r\nOn ceremonial occasions they permit themselves to wear a full-length\r\nkimono and the _hakama_ or divided skirt, but they deny themselves the\r\nthird article of a Japanese man's full dress, the _haori_ or silk\r\novercoat. An effort is also made to dispense with the use of\r\n\"luxurious\" _geta_ (the national wooden pattens).[19]\r\n\r\nThe object of all this varied discipline is to develop physique,\r\nself-control, self-respect and what the Japanese call the spirit of\r\nassociation, or, as we might say, good fellowship. The spirit of\r\nassociation is needed in order to promote greater administrative,\r\neducational and social efficiency. The modern Japanese village is no\r\nlonger an historical but a political unit which covers a considerable\r\ndistrict. It is, as I have explained, a combination of clusters of\r\n_aza_ (hamlets). Each of these _aza_ has its local sentiment, and this\r\nlocal sentiment when untouched by outside influences tends to become\r\nselfish, narrow and prejudiced. If, however, anything is to be done in\r\nthe development of rural life there must be co-operation between\r\n_aza_ for all sorts of objects.\r\n\r\nI was assured that in addition to the development of physique, _moral_\r\nand the spirit of association, there was to be seen, under the\r\ninfluence of the Y.M.A., a development of good manners and mental\r\nnimbleness. A special result of early rising and discipline in one\r\narea had been that \"the habit of spending evening hours idly has died\r\naway, immorality has diminished, singing loudly and foolishly and\r\nboasting oneself have disappeared, while punctuality and respect for\r\nold age have increased.\" I was even assured that parents--whom no true\r\nJapanese would ever dream of attempting to reform at first\r\nhand--parents, I say, moved by the physical and mental advance in\r\ntheir sons, have \"begun to practise greater punctuality.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the drilling was over I was taken to a large elementary school\r\nand was called upon to address the young men, who were kneeling in\r\nperfect files. Mr. Yamasaki followed me and told the youths that\r\nJapanese were not so tall as they might be, and that therefore their\r\nphysique \"must be continuously developed.\" Nor were rural conditions\r\nall they should be from a moral point of view. Therefore, \"every\r\ndesire which interferes with the development of your health or\r\nmorality must be overcome.\"\r\n\r\nLet me speak of another village. It numbers a thousand families and it\r\nrises in the morning and goes to bed at night by the sound of the\r\nbugle. It has five public baths and a notice-board of news \"to enlarge\r\npeople's ideas.\" The shopkeepers are said to \"work very diligently, so\r\nthings are cheaper.\" The education of such of the young men as are\r\nexempted from military service is continued on Saturday evenings for\r\nfour years. The Y.M.A., in addition to the military discipline,\r\nfencing, wrestling, weight-lifting and pole-twisting of which I have\r\nspoken, exercises itself in handwriting--which many Japanese practise\r\nas an art during their whole lifetime--and in composing the\r\nconventional short poem. I was gravely informed that \"the custom of\r\nspending money on sweet-stuff is decreasing.\" What this really means\r\nis that the young men were not frequenting the sweet-stuff shops,\r\nwhich are staffed by girls who are in many cases a greater temptation\r\nthan the sweets. The worthy members of this association had \"burnt\r\ntheir _geta_.\"\r\n\r\nIn some places Y.M.A. members give their labour when a school teacher\r\nor a fellow member is building his house, or they do repairs at the\r\nschool. Bicycle excursions are made to neighbouring villages in order\r\nto participate in inter-Y.M.A. debates, or to study vegetable raising,\r\nfruit culture or poultry keeping. The Japanese are much given to\r\n\"taking trips,\" and the special training which they receive at school\r\nin making notes and plans results in everybody having a notebook and\r\nbeing able to sketch a rough route-plan for personal use, or for a\r\nstranger who may ask his way.\r\n\r\nNot a few associations favour members cutting each other's hair once a\r\nfortnight, thus at one and the same time saving money and curbing\r\nvanity. Several Y.M.A.s publish cyclostyled monthlies. Others minutely\r\ninvestigate the economic condition of their villages. Some Y.M.A.s\r\nprovide public \"complaint boxes,\" and have boards up asking for\r\nfriendly help for soldiers billeted in the district. One association\r\nhas issued instructions to its members that they are not to ride when\r\nin charge of ox-drawn carts. The reason is that the ox is only\r\npartially under control and may injure a pedestrian--unwittingly, I am\r\nsure, for the gentleness of the ox and even of the bull in harness\r\narrests one's attention. Many Y.M.A.s devote themselves to cultivating\r\nimproved qualities of rice or to breaking up new land. Sometimes the\r\nland of the Shinto shrine is cultivated. I have heard of Y.M.A.s in\r\nremote parts having handed over to them the exclusive sale of _saké_.\r\n\r\nI find a Y.M.A. counselling its members \"not to speak vulgar words in\r\na crowd.\" There is also among the members of Y.M.A.s a certain\r\naddiction to diary keeping for moral as well as economic purposes. The\r\ndiaries are distributed by the associations and \"afterwards examined\r\nand rewarded\"--a plan which would hardly work in the West. There are\r\nY.M.A.s which make a point of seeing off conscripts with flags and\r\nmusic. Others have fallen on the more economical plan of \"writing to\r\nthe conscript as often as possible and helping with labour the family\r\nwhich is suffering from the loss of his services.\" By some Y.M.A.s\r\n\"old people are respected and comforted.\" More than one association\r\nhas a practice of serving out red and black balls to its members at\r\nthe opening of every new year, when good resolutions are in order, and\r\nat the end of the year recalling either the red or the black according\r\nto the degree to which the publicly announced good resolutions have\r\nbeen kept. Among the good resolutions are: to worship at the Shinto\r\nshrine or the Buddhist temple regularly, to be tidier, to be more\r\nefficient in cropping the land, to undertake work for the common good,\r\nto have a secondary occupation in addition to farming, to sit with\r\nmore decorum at meals, to rise earlier, to visit the graves of\r\nancestors monthly, to be more considerate to parents or elder\r\nbrothers, and \"not to remain idly at people's houses.\"\r\n\r\nOne Y.M.A. decrees that a member found in a tea-house in conversation\r\nwith a geisha shall be fined 20 yen. There is even a village in which\r\nthe young men's association and the young women's association have\r\nunited to issue a regulation providing that at night time members, in\r\norder that their doings shall be public, shall carry lanterns painted\r\nwith the ideographs of their societies.[20]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the young women's associations, I found that one of\r\nthem studied domestic matters and good manners, \"asking questions and\r\nreceiving answers.\" The motto of the organisation was \"Good Wives and\r\nGood Mothers.\" A member, this Society believes, should be \"polite,\r\ngentle and warm-hearted, but with a strong will inside and able to\r\nmeet difficulties.\" Her hairdressing and clothes \"should not be\r\nluxurious,\" and she \"must not run after fashions.\" She must \"respect\r\nBuddha and abandon sweet-eating,\" for \"taking food between meals is\r\nbad for your health, for economy and for your posterity.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now hear something of Societies for the Cultivation of Rice by\r\nSchoolboys. The lads become responsible for the cultivation of a _tan_\r\nof their family land, or of a small paddy, and they work it themselves\r\nwith the help of such advice as the schoolmaster may give them. (The\r\ncultivation of a _tan_ of a paddy, a quarter of an acre, is supposed\r\nto need in a year about twenty-one days' labour of a man working from\r\nsunrise to sunset.) The report of one boy to which I turned in a\r\ncollection of reports by members of a rice-cultivation society showed\r\nthat he was between fourteen and fifteen. His diary of work and\r\nobservations was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _June_ 5.--4 _to_ of herring applied.\r\n\r\n  _June_ 7.--Locusts and other insects arrive.[21]\r\n\r\n  _June_ 20.--153 clumps of rice transplanted from the seed bed.[22]\r\n\r\n  _July_ 11.--Rice cultivated and 4 _to_ of herring applied.\r\n\r\n  _July_ 27.--First weeding.\r\n\r\n  _Aug_. 6.--Second weeding.\r\n\r\n  _Aug_. 8.--Locusts again.\r\n\r\n  _Aug_. 11.--Third weeding.\r\n\r\n  _Sept_. 10.--All ears shot.\r\n\r\n  _Oct_. 10.--Some plants suffering from bacillus.\r\n\r\nIt was further noted that the soil was sandy, that cold spring water\r\nwas percolating through the bottom of the paddy field, that the\r\naeration of the soil was bad and that some plants were laid by wind.\r\nThe young farmer appended to his report an excellent plan. He received\r\nmarks as follows: Method of planting, 15; levelling, 20; provision\r\nagainst insects, 5; general attention, 25; total, 65. Some boys got as\r\nmany as 99 marks.\r\n\r\nA word concerning a Village Association for Promoting Morality. One of\r\nthe things it does is to assemble yearly the whole population, old and\r\nyoung, \"in order to get friendly.\" The police meanwhile keep an eye\r\nopen for strangers who might take it into their heads to visit the\r\nvillage on that day and help themselves from the houses. I may quote\r\nthree poems in rough translations from a speech made by a priest at\r\nthe annual meeting:\r\n\r\nThe legs of a horse, the rudder of a boat, the pin of a fan,\r\n    and the sincerity of a man.\r\nLet your heart be pure and true and you need not pray\r\n    for the protection of the gods.\r\nThe bride brings many things with her to her new home,\r\n    but one thing more, the spirit of sincerity, will not\r\n    encumber her.\r\n\r\nAfter these varied accounts of rural merit, I could not but listen\r\nwith attention to a tale of village gamblers, the offence of gambling\r\nhaving been \"introduced by the excavators on the new railway.\" First\r\nthe headman fined a dozen young men. Then he made a raid and found\r\namong the village sinners several members of his own council. \"The\r\nsalaried officials were at a loss to know what to do, and proposed to\r\nresign. But the headman brought the prisoners together before the\r\nwhole body of officials. He spoke of the sufferings of the troops in\r\nManchuria and the heroic deaths among them. (It was the time of the\r\nRussian war.) 'Lest your offences should come to be known by our\r\nsoldiers and discourage them,' said the headman, 'I cannot but\r\noverlook your conduct.' It is thought that gambling practically ceased\r\nfrom that time.\"\r\n\r\nLocal officials have a way of making the most of historic events in\r\norder to touch the imagination of their villagers. Many original\r\nundertakings were begun, for example, under the inspiration of the\r\nCoronation. One village set about raising a fund by a system of\r\ntaxation under which inhabitants contribute according to the following\r\ntariff:\r\n\r\n  Birth of a child, 10 sen (that is, 2-1/2 d. or 5 cents).\r\n  Wedding, 15 sen.\r\n  Adoption, 15 sen.\r\n  Graduation from the primary school, 10 sen; advanced\r\n      school, 20 sen.\r\n  Teacher or official on appointment, 2 per cent. of salary;\r\n      when salary is increased, 10 per cent. of increase.\r\n  When an official receives a prize of money from his\r\n      superior, 5 per cent.\r\n  Every villager to pay every quarter, 1 sen.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this assessment it is expected that fifty-seven years\r\nafter the Coronation such a sum will have been accumulated as will\r\nenable the villagers to live rate free. Some villages have\r\nthanksgiving associations in connection with Shinto shrines. Aged\r\nvillagers are \"respected by being blessed before the shrine and by\r\nbeing given a present.\" Worthy villagers who are not aged \"receive\r\nprizes and honour.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once when I went to a village I was welcomed first by a\r\nparade of the Y.M.A., then by the school children in rows, and finally\r\nin the school grounds by two lines of venerable members of an\r\nEx-Public Servants' Association. The object of an E.P.S.A. is to\r\nstrengthen the hands of the present officials and to give honour to\r\ntheir predecessors. A headman explained to me: \"If ex-officials fell\r\ninto poverty or lacked public respect, people would not be inclined to\r\nwork for the public good. A former clerk in the village office whom\r\neverybody had forgotten was working as a labourer. But as a member of\r\nthe association he was seen to be treated with honour, so the children\r\nwere impressed. The funeral of such a man is apt to be lonely, but\r\nwhen this man died all the members of the association attended his\r\nfuneral in ceremonial dress and offered some money to his memory.[23]\r\nHis honour is great and the villagers say, 'We may well work for the\r\npublic benefit.'\"\r\n\r\nEvery village in Japan has a Village Agricultural Association. One\r\nV.A.A., which belongs to a village of less than 6,000 people, sees the\r\nfruit of its labours in the existence of \"322 good manure houses.\" The\r\ngift of a plan and the grant of a yen had prompted the building of\r\nmost of them. Then the organisation incites its members to cement the\r\nground below their dwellings. This is not so much for the benefit of\r\nthe farmer and his family as for the welfare of their silkworms. A fly\r\nharmful to silkworms winters in the soil, but it cannot find a\r\nresting-place in concrete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WIDE EXPANSE OF ADJUSTED RICE-FIELDS.]\r\n\r\nA word may also be said about the way in which silkworm rearers have\r\nbeen induced by the V.A.A. to keep the same breed of caterpillar, so\r\nfacilitating bulking of cocoons at the association's co-operative\r\nsales. A small library of silkworm-culture books has been started in\r\nthe village, and there is a special pamphlet for young men which\r\nthey are urged to keep in \"their pockets and to study ten minutes each\r\nday.\" A general library has 2,400 volumes divided into eight\r\ncirculating libraries. The cost of the building which provides the\r\nlibrary in chief, a meeting hall and also a storehouse for cocoons has\r\nbeen defrayed by the commissions charged for the co-operative sale of\r\ncocoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBRARY AND WORKSHED OF A YOUNG MEN'S ASSOCIATION.]\r\n\r\nAgain, there used to be no cattle in the village, but now, thanks to\r\nthe purchase of young animals by the association, and thanks to\r\nvillage shows, there are 103.\r\n\r\nThere is a competition to get the biggest yield of rice, and there is\r\nalso \"an exhibition of crops.\" This exhibition incidentally aims at\r\nending trouble between landlord and tenants due to complaints of the\r\ninferiority of the rice brought in as rent. (Paddy-field rent is\r\ninvariably paid in rice.) These complaints are more directly dealt\r\nwith by the V.A.A. arbitrating between landlords and tenants who are\r\nat issue. In addition to rice crop and cattle shows in the village,\r\nthere is a yearly exhibition of the prod ucts of secondary industries,\r\nsuch as mats, sandals and hats.\r\n\r\nThe V.A.A. is also working to secure the planting of hill-side waste.\r\nSome 300,000 tree seedlings have been distributed to members of the\r\nY.M.A., who \"grow them on,\" and, after examination and criticism,\r\nplant them out. I must not omit to speak of the V.A.A.s' distribution\r\nof moral and economic diaries of the type already referred to. The\r\nvillagers, in the spirit of boy-scoutism, are \"advised to do one good\r\nthing in a day.\" I saw several of these diaries, well thumbed by their\r\nauthors after having been laboured at for a year. One young farmer\r\nnoted down on the space for January 2 that he said his prayers and\r\nthen went _daikon_[24] pulling, and that _daikon_ pulling (like our\r\nmangold pulling) is a cold job.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] There are, however, 11,000 members of Y.M.C.A. in Japan. There is\r\nalso a Y.W.C.A. with a considerable membership.\r\n\r\n[19] See Appendix II.\r\n\r\n[20] For official action in regard to the Y.M.A.s, see later.\r\n\r\n[21] The damage done by insects is estimated at 10 million yen a year.\r\nIn some parts locusts are roasted and eaten.\r\n\r\n[22] For an account of the processes of rice cultivation, see Chapter\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n[23] It is the practical Japanese custom to make a gift of money to a\r\nfamily on the occasion of a death.

I went to this\r\nannual \"meeting of skilful farmers.\" Among the speakers were the local\r\ngovernor and chiefs of departments who had been sent down by the\r\nMinistry of Agriculture and the Home Office. According to our ideas,\r\neverybody but the unpractised speakers--the expert farmers who were\r\ncalled from time to time to the platform--spoke too long. But the\r\nkneeling audience found no fault. Indeed, a third of it was taking\r\nnotes. It was an audience of seeking souls.\r\n\r\nOne of the impromptu speakers, a white-haired, toil-marked farmer,\r\ntold how forty years before he had gone to the next prefecture and\r\nopened new land. \"With his spectacles and moustache,\" explained the\r\nchairman--if the man who takes the initiative from time to time at a\r\nJapanese meeting may be properly called a chairman--\"he looks like a\r\ngentleman; but he works hard.\" And the man showed his hands as a\r\ntestimony to the severity of his labours.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the winter,\" he said, \"that I went away from my home and\r\nobtained a certain tract of waste. I had no acquaintance near. I\r\nbrought some food, but when I fell short I had no more. I had gone\r\nwith my third boy. We lived in a small hut and were in a miserable\r\ncondition. Then a fierce wind took off the roof. It was at four in the\r\nmorning when the roof blew off. In February I began to open a rice\r\nfield. Gradually we got a _chō_. At length I opened another _chō_,\r\nbut there was much gravel. Some of my newly opened fields are very\r\nhigh up the hill. If you chance to pass my house please come to see\r\nme. The maple leaves are very beautiful and you can enjoy the sight of\r\nmany birds.\"\r\n\r\nThe early meetings of the expert farmers used to last not one day but\r\ntwo, for the men delighted in narrating their experiences to one\r\nanother. Some of the audience used to weep as the older men told their\r\ntales. The farmers would sit up late round a farmer or a professor who\r\nwas talking about some subject that interested them. The originator of\r\nthese gatherings, Mr. Yamasaki, told me that he was \"more than once\r\nmoved to tears by the merits and pure hearts of the farmer speakers.\"\r\n\r\nOf the regard and respect which the farmers had for this man I had\r\nmany indications. Like not a few agricultural authorities, he is a\r\nsamurai.[25] He is exceptionally tall for a Japanese, looks indeed\r\nrather like a Highland gillie, and when one evening I prevailed on him\r\nto put on armour, thrust two swords in his _obi_ and take a long bow\r\nin his hand, he was an imposing figure. He carries the ideals of\r\n_bushido_ into his rural work. He does not sleep more than five hours,\r\nand he is up every morning at five.\r\n\r\nBut I am getting away from the meeting. There was a priest who spoke,\r\na man curiously like Tolstoy. (He had, no doubt, Ainu blood in him.)\r\nHe wore the stiff buttoned-up jacket of the primary school teacher and\r\nspoke modestly. \"Formerly the rice fields of my village suffered very\r\nmuch from bad irrigation,\" he said, \"but when that was put right the\r\nsoil became excellent. In the days when the soil was bad the people\r\nwere good and no man suspected another of stealing his seal.[26] But\r\nwhen the soil became good the disposition of the people was influenced\r\nin a bad way, and they brought their seals to the temple to be kept\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n\"At that time the organiser of this meeting came and made a speech in\r\nmy village. On hearing his speech I thought it an easy task to make my\r\nvillage good. At once I began to do good things. I formed several\r\nmen's and women's associations, all at once, as if I were Buddha. But\r\nthe real condition of the people was not much improved. There came\r\nmany troubles upon me, and our friend wrote a letter. I was very\r\nthankful, and I have been keeping that letter in the temple and bowing\r\nthere morning and evening.\r\n\r\n\"I began to ask many distinguished persons to help me. They influenced\r\nthe farmers. The sight of a good man is enough. Speech is unnecessary.\r\nThe villagers were not educated enough to understand moralisings or\r\nthinking, but the kind face of a good man has efficacy. There was a\r\nman in the village who was demoralised, and when I told of him to a\r\ndistinguished man who lives near our village he sympathised very much.\r\nThat distinguished man is eighty-four years old, but he accompanied\r\nthat demoralised man for three days, giving no instruction but simply\r\nliving the same life, and the demoralised man was an entirely changed\r\nman and ever thankful.\r\n\r\n\"I am a sinful man. Sometimes it happens that after I have been\r\nworking for the public benefit I am glad that I am offered thanks. I\r\nknow it is not a good thing when people express gratitude to me, for I\r\nought not to accept it. When I know I am doing a good thing and\r\nexpecting thanks, I am not doing a good thing. My thanks must not come\r\nfrom men but from Buddha. I am trying to cast out my sinful feelings.\r\nIt must not be supposed that I am leading these people. You skilful\r\nfarmers kindly come to my village if you pass. You need not give any\r\nspeech. Your good faces will do.\"\r\n\r\nBut the two speeches I have reported are hardly a fair sample of the\r\ndiscourses which were delivered. The addresses of the earnest Tokyo\r\nofficials and the Governor were directed towards urging on the farmers\r\nincreased production and increased labour, and the duty was pressed\r\nupon them, as I understood, in the name of the highest patriotism and\r\nof devotion to their ancestors. This talk was excellent in its way,\r\nbut when I got up I hazarded a few words on different lines. If I\r\nventure to summarise my somewhat elementary address it is because it\r\nfurnishes a key to some of the enquiries I was to make during my\r\njourneys. I was told the next day that the local daily had declared\r\nthat my \"tongue was tipped with fire,\" which was a compliment to my\r\nkind and clever interpreter, who, when he let himself go, seemed to be\r\nable to make two or three sentences out of every one of mine:\r\n\r\nI said that my Japanese friends kept asking me my impressions, and one\r\nthing I had to say to them was that I had got an impression in many\r\nquarters of spiritual dryness. I dared to think that some\r\nresponsibility for a materialistic outlook must be shared by the\r\nadmirable officials and experts who moved about among the farmers.\r\nThey were always talking about crop yields and the amount of money\r\nmade, and they unconsciously pressed home the idea that rural progress\r\nwas a material thing.\r\n\r\nBut the rural problem was not only a problem of better crops and of\r\ngreater production. Man did not live by food alone. Tolstoy wrote a\r\nbook called _What Men Live By_, and there was nothing in it about\r\nfood. Men lived not by the number of bales of rice they raised, but by\r\nthe development of their minds and hearts. It might be asked if it was\r\nnot the business of rural experts to teach agriculture. But a poet of\r\nmy country had said that it took a soul to move a pig into a cleaner\r\nsty. It was necessary for a man who was to teach agriculture well to\r\nknow something higher than agriculture. The teacher must be more\r\nadvanced than his pupils. There must be a source from which the energy\r\nof the rural teacher must be again and again renewed. There must be a\r\nwell from which he must be continually refreshed and stimulated. Some\r\ncalled that well by the name of religion, unity with God. Some called\r\nit faith in mankind, faith in the destiny of the world, that faith in\r\nman which is faith in God. But it must be a real belief, not a\r\nhalf-hearted, shivering faith.\r\n\r\nAgriculture was not only the oldest and the most serviceable calling,\r\nit was the foundation of everything. But the fact must not be lost\r\nsight of that agriculture, important and vital though it was, was only\r\na means to an end. The object in view was to have in the rural\r\ndistricts better men, women and children. The highest aim of rural\r\nprogress was to develop the minds and hearts of the rural population,\r\nand in all discussion of the rural problems it was necessary not to\r\nlose in technology a clear view of the final object.\r\n\r\nBut when account is taken of all the drab materialism in the rural\r\ndistricts there remains a leaven of unworldliness. It takes various\r\nforms. Here is the story of a landlord at whose beautiful house I\r\nstayed. \"When a tenant brings his rent rice to this landlord's\r\nstorehouse,\" a fellow-guest told me, \"it is never examined. The door\r\nof the storehouse is left unpadlocked, and the rent rice is brought by\r\nthe tenant when he is minded to do so. No one takes note of his\r\ncoming. If he meets his landlord on the road he may say, 'I brought\r\nyou the rent,' and the landlord says, 'It is very kind of you.' It is\r\nan old custom not to supervise the tenants' bringing of the rent.\r\n\r\n\"Nowadays, however, some tenants are sly. They say, 'Our landlord\r\nnever looks into our payments. Therefore we can bring him inferior\r\nrice or less than the quantity.' The landlord loses somewhat by this,\r\nbut it is not in accordance with the honour of his family to change\r\nthe method of collecting his rent. He is now chairman of the village\r\nco-operative society as well as of the young men's society, and he\r\naims to improve his village fundamentally.\"\r\n\r\nI also heard this narrative. The tenants in a certain place wished to\r\ncultivate rice land rather than to farm dry land. But when silkworm\r\ncultivation became prosperous they began to prefer dry land again in\r\norder that they might extend the area of mulberries. Therefore the\r\nlandlords raised the rents of the dry farms. But there was one\r\nlandlord who said, \"If this dry farm land had been improved by me I\r\nshould be justified in raising the rent. But I did not improve it.\r\nTherefore it would be base to take advantage of economic conditions to\r\nraise the rent.\"\r\n\r\nSo he did not raise the rent. Then he was excluded from social\r\nintercourse by the other landlords because their tenants grumbled.\r\nThese landlords said to him, \"You can afford not to raise your rents,\r\nbut we cannot.\" Therefore the landlord who had not raised his rents\r\ncalled his tenants together. He said to them, \"It is a hard thing for\r\nme to have no social intercourse with my equals. Therefore I will now\r\nraise the rents. But I cannot accept that raised portion, and I will\r\ntake care of it for you, and in ten years I think it will amount to\r\nenough for you to start a cooperative society.\"\r\n\r\nThat was eight years ago and the formation of the society was now\r\nproceeding. In order that the reader may not forget on what a very\r\ndifferent scale landlordism exists in Japan, I may mention that the\r\narea owned by this landlord was only 10 _chō_.\r\n\r\nI was told the story of a landlord's solution of the rent reduction\r\nproblem. \"Tenants,\" the narrator said, \"sometimes pretend that their\r\ncrops are poorer than they are. Landlords may reduce the payment due,\r\nbut sometimes with a certain resentment. One landowner was asked for a\r\nreduction for several years in succession on account of poor crops,\r\nand gave it. But he was trying to think of a plan to defeat the\r\npretences of his tenants. At last he hit on one. While the tenants'\r\nrice was young he often visited the fields, and when any insects were\r\nto be seen he sent his labourers secretly to destroy them. In the same\r\nway, when crops seemed to be under-manured, he secretly cast\r\nartificial manure on them. At last his tenants found out what he was\r\ndoing, and they said, 'As our landlord is so kind to us, we must not\r\npretend that we need a reduction.' And they did not, and things are\r\ngoing on very well there. This is an illustration of the fact that our\r\npeople are moved more by feeling than by logic.\"\r\n\r\nThis was capped by another story. \"A landlord, a samurai, has for his\r\ntenants his former subjects, so something of the relation of master\r\nand servant still remains. He wished to raise his tenants to the\r\nposition of peasant proprietors, so when land was for sale in the\r\nvillage he advised them to buy. They said they had no money, but he\r\nanswered, 'Means may perhaps be found.' He secretly subscribed a sum\r\nto the Shinto shrine and then advised the formation of a co-operative\r\nsociety, which could borrow from the shrine for a tenant, so that the\r\ntenant need not go to the landlord to thank him and feel patronised by\r\nhim. He need only to go to the shrine and give thanks there.\" \"The\r\nlandlord,\" added the speaker in his imperfect English, \"has entirely\r\nhided himself from the business.\" A third of the tenants had become\r\npeasant proprietors.\r\n\r\nIn order to better the feeling between the farmers and landowners this\r\nlandlord and several others had begun to ask their tenants to their\r\ngardens, where they were given tea and fruit. \"In Japan,\" said one man\r\nto me, \"we see feudal ideas broken down by the upper, not the lower\r\nclass.\"\r\n\r\nI visited the romantic coast of a peninsula a dozen miles from the\r\nrailway. Some 10,000 pilgrims come in a year to the eighty-eight\r\ntemples on the peninsula, and in some parts the people are such strict\r\nBuddhists that in one village the county authorities find great\r\ndifficulty in overcoming an objection to destroying the insect life\r\nwhich preys on the rice crops. When rice land does not yield well, one\r\nlandlord causes an investigation to be made and gives advice based\r\nupon it to the tenant, saying, \"Do this, and if you lose I will\r\ncompensate you. If you gain, the advantage will be yours.\" Money is\r\nalso contributed by the landlord to enable tenants to make journeys in\r\norder to study farming methods.\r\n\r\nA landlord here--I had the pleasure of being his guest--had started an\r\nagricultural association. It had developed the idea of a secondary\r\nschool for practical instruction, \"rich men to give their money and\r\npoor men their labour.\" In order to obtain a fund to enable tenants to\r\nget money with which to set up as peasant proprietors, this landlord\r\nhad thought of the plan of setting aside each harvest 250 _shō_[27] of\r\nrice to each tenant's 3 _shō_.\r\n\r\nGood work was done in teaching farmers' wives. \"When no instruction is\r\ngiven,\" I was informed, \"a wife may say, when her husband is testing\r\nhis rice seed with salt water, 'Salt is very dear, nowadays, why not\r\nfresh water?' If a husband is kind he will explain. If not, some\r\nunpleasantness may arise, so wives are taught about the necessity of\r\nselecting by salt water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDOWNER'S SON AND DAUGHTER OFF TO THE VILLAGE\r\nSCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUDDHIST SHRINE IN A LANDOWNER'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nTenants are advised to save a farthing a day. In order to keep them\r\nsteadfast in their thriftiness they are asked to bring their savings\r\nto their landlord every ten days. It is troublesome to be\r\nconstantly receiving so many small sums, but the landlord and his\r\nbrother think that they should not grudge the trouble. In two years\r\nnearly 1,000 yen have been saved. Said one tenant to his landlord, \"I\r\nknow how to save now, therefore I save.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. YAMASAKI, DR. NITOBE, THE AUTHOR AND PROFESSOR\r\nNASU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOME IN WHICH THE TEA CEREMONY TOOK PLACE.]\r\n\r\nOne of my hosts, who was thirty-two, hoped to see all his tenants\r\npeasant proprietors before he was fifty. The relation of this landlord\r\nand his tenants was illustrated by the fact that on my arrival several\r\nfarmers brought produce to the kitchen \"because we heard that the\r\nlandlord had guests.\" The village was very kind in its reception of\r\nthe foreign visitor. A meeting was called in the temple. I told the\r\nstory of Wren's _Si monumentum requiris circumspice_ and pointed a\r\nrural moral. Some months afterwards I received a request from my host\r\nto write a word or two of preface to go with a report of my address\r\nwhich he was giving to each of his tenants as a New Year gift.\r\n\r\nThis landlord's family had lived in the same house for eleven\r\ngenerations. The courtesy of my host and his relatives and the beauty\r\nof their old house and its contents are an ineffaceable memory. From\r\nthe time my party arrived until the time we left no servant was\r\nallowed to do anything for us. The ladies of the house cooked our food\r\nand the landlord and his younger brother brought it to us. The younger\r\nbrother waited upon us throughout our meals, even peeling our pears.\r\nAt night he spread our silk-covered _futon_ (mattresses). In the\r\nmorning he folded them up, arranged my clothes, swept the room and\r\nstood at hand with towels, all of which were new, while I washed.\r\n\r\nWhen on our arrival in the house we sat and talked in the first\r\nreception-room we entered, I noticed that outside the lattice a\r\ncompany of villagers was listening with no consciousness of intrusion,\r\nin full view of our host, to the sound of foreign speech. It was a\r\nShakespearean scene.\r\n\r\nOut of its setting, as it is often witnessed to-day, the tea ceremony\r\nseems meaningless and wearisome, an affected simplicity of the idle.\r\nBut as a guest of this old house of fine timbers weathered to\r\nsilver-grey I found the secret of _Cha-no-yu_. This flower of Far\r\nEastern civilisation is an æsthetic expression of true\r\ngood-fellowship, and a gentle simplicity and sincerity are of its\r\nessence. The admission of a foreigner to a family _Cha-no-yu_ was a\r\ngesture of confidence.\r\n\r\nFive of us gathered late in the afternoon of an August day in the cool\r\nmatted rest-room in the garden. We looked on the beauty that\r\ngenerations of gardeners of a single vision had created. Our minds\r\nrested in the quiet as in the quaint phrase, we \"tasted the sound of\r\nthe kettle and listened to the incense.\" At length at a signal we\r\nrose. Led by the priestess of the ceremony, our host's aunt, a slight\r\nfigure in grey with snow-white _tabi_ and new straw sandals, we passed\r\nby the dripping rocky fountain, with its lilies, and the azure\r\nhydrangea of the hills which, some say, suggests distance. The\r\nhut-like tea-room, traditionally rude in the material of which it was\r\nbuilt but perfect in every detail of its workmanship, we entered one\r\nby one. According to old custom we humbly crept through the small\r\nopening which serves as entrance, the idea being that all worldly rank\r\nmust bow at the sanctuary of beauty. The tiny chamber held, besides\r\nthe wonderful vessels of the ceremony, a flower arrangement of blue\r\nMichaelmas daisies, and an exquisite scroll of wild duck in flight in\r\nthe miniature _tokonoma_,[28] the tea mistress, our host and four\r\nguests. We drank from a black daimyo bowl which had been made four\r\nhundred years before. We passed an hour together and in the twilight\r\nwe came out from the little room as from a sacrament of friendship. A\r\nyear afterwards my host wrote to me, \"Yesterday we had _Cha-no-yu_\r\nagain and you were in our thoughts. During the ceremony we placed your\r\nphotograph in the _tokonoma_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we had _kyōgen_[29] by distinguished amateurs, one of\r\nwhom, a neighbouring landowner, had lately appeared before the\r\nEmperor. After the plays he painted _kyōgen_ scenes for us on\r\n_kakemono_ and fans. He painted the _kakemono_ as he knelt with his\r\npaper lying on a square of soft material on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe plays were performed in ancient costumes or copies of old ones\r\nand of course without scenery. The players were lighted by oily\r\ncandles two inches in diameter, which flamed and guttered in\r\ncandlesticks not of this century nor of the last. A player may make\r\nhis exit merely by sitting down. The players are men; masks are used\r\nin playing women's parts. The stories are of the simplest. There was\r\nthe well-known tale of the sly servant who was sent to town by a\r\nstupid daimyo in order to buy a fan, and, though he brought back an\r\numbrella, succeeded in imposing it on his master. There was also the\r\nplay of the fox who comes to a farmer to advise him not to kill foxes,\r\nbut is himself caught in a trap. I also recall a story of two good\r\ntenants who had been rewarded by their landlord with an order that\r\nthey should receive hats. Owing to an oversight they received one hat\r\nonly between the two. Problem, how to meet the difficulty. It was\r\nsolved by the rustics fastening two pieces of wood together T-shape,\r\nraising the hat of honour upon the structure and walking home in\r\ntriumph under either side of the T.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was greeted by the aged father and mother of our\r\nhost. The household was an interesting one, for the landlord and his\r\nbrother were married to two sisters. Before taking our departure we\r\nknelt with our landlord and his father before the Buddhist shrine on\r\nwhich rested the memorial tablets of former heads of the house. I\r\nexpressed my sense of the privilege extended to strangers. The reply\r\nwas, \"Our ancestors will feel pleasure in your being among us.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Samurai or _shizoku_ comprise about a twentieth of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[26] Every Japanese signs by means of a stone or hard-wood seal which\r\nhe keeps in a case and ordinarily carries with him.\r\n\r\n[27] A _shō_ is about a quart and a half.\r\n\r\n[28] The raised recess in which is usually displayed the flower\r\narrangement, a piece of pottery and a _kakemono_.

GREEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stranger in Japan sees so little of the intimacies of country life\r\nthat I shall say something of further visits to what we should call\r\ncounty families. My hosts, who seemed to be active to a greater or\r\nless degree in promoting the welfare of their tenants, lived in purely\r\nJapanese style. Yet now and then in a beautiful house there was a\r\nshowy gilt timepiece or some other thing of a deplorable Western\r\nfashion. At all the houses without exception we were waited upon by\r\nthe host and his son, son-in-law or brother, and for some time after\r\nour arrival our host and the members of his family would kneel, not in\r\nthe apartment in which our _zabuton_ (kneeling cushions) were\r\narranged, but in the adjoining apartment with its screens pushed back.\r\nEven when the time of sweets and tea had passed and a regular meal was\r\nserved, all the little tables of food were brought in not by servants\r\nbut by the master of the house and such male relatives as were at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhen the duration of a Japanese meal is borne in mind, some idea may\r\nbe gained of the fatigue endured by the head of a house in serving\r\nmany guests. The host sometimes honours his guests still further by\r\neating apart from them or by partaking of a portion only of the meal.\r\nThe name of a feast in Japanese is significant, \"a running about.\" The\r\nladies of the house are usually seen for only a few minutes, when they\r\ncome with the children to welcome the guests on their arrival; but on\r\nthe second day of the visit the ladies may bring in food or tea or\r\nplay the _koto_.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner, though on his knees, feels a little at a loss to know\r\nhow to acknowledge politely the repeated bows of so many kneeling men\r\nand women. He watches with appreciation the perfect response of his\r\nJapanese travelling companions. It is difficult to convey a sense of\r\nthe charm and dignity of old courtesies exchanged with sincerity\r\nbetween well-bred people in a fine old house. Although all the\r\n_shoji_[30] are open, the trees of the beautiful garden cast a pensive\r\nshade. The ancient ceremonial of welcome and introduction would seem\r\nludicrous in the full light of a Western drawing-room, but in the\r\nperfectly subdued light of these romantically beautiful apartments,\r\ncharged with some strange and melancholy emotion, the visitor from the\r\nWest feels himself entering upon the rare experience of a new world.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows how few are the treasures that a Japanese displays in\r\nhis house. His heirlooms and works of art are stored in a fireproof\r\nannexe. For the feasting of the eye of every guest or party of\r\nvisitors the appropriate choice of _kakemono_,[31] carving or pottery\r\nis made. I had the delight of seeing during my country-house visiting\r\nmany ancient pictures of country life and of animals and birds. It was\r\nalso a precious opportunity to inspect armour and wonderful swords and\r\nstands of arrows in the houses in which the men who had worn the\r\narmour and used the weapons had lived. The way of stringing the\r\nseven-feet-high bow was shown to me by a kimono-clad samurai, as has\r\nbeen recorded in the previous chapter. When he threw himself into a\r\nwarlike attitude and with an ancient cry whirled a gleaming two-handed\r\nsword in the dim light thrown by lanterns which had lighted the house\r\nin the time of the Shoguns, the figures on old-time Japanese prints\r\nhad a new vividness.\r\n\r\nWhat also helped in illuminating for me the old prints of warlike\r\nscenes was a display of a remarkable kind of fencing with naked\r\nweapons which one of my hosts kindly provided in his garden one\r\nevening. The tournament was conducted by the village young men's\r\nassociation. The exercises, which, as I saw them, are peculiar to the\r\ndistrict, are called _ki-ai_, which means literally \"spirit meeting.\"\r\nThey call not only for long training but for courage and ardour. The\r\ncombats took place on a small patch of grass which was fenced by four\r\nbamboo branches. These were connected by a rope of paper streamers\r\nsuch as are used to distinguish a consecrated place. Before the first\r\nbout the bamboos and rope were taken away and a handful of salt was\r\nthrown on the grass. Salt was similarly thrown on the grass before\r\nevery contest. The idea is that salt is a purifier. It signifies, like\r\nthe handshake of our boxers, that the feelings of the combatants are\r\ncleansed from malice.\r\n\r\nMost of the events were single combats, but there were two meetings in\r\nwhich a man confronted a couple of assailants. The contests I recall\r\nwere spear _v_. spear, spear _v_. sword, sword _v_. long billhook,\r\nspear _v_. the short Japanese sickle and a chain, spear _v_. paper\r\numbrella and sword, pole _v_. wooden sword, pole _v_. pole, and long\r\nbillhook _v_. fan and sword. The weapons were sharp enough to inflict\r\nserious wounds if a false move should be made or there should be a\r\nmomentary lack of self-control. The flashing steel gave an impression\r\nof imminent danger. There was also the feeling aroused in the\r\nspectators by the way in which the combatants sought to gain advantage\r\nover one another by fierce snarls, stamping on the ground and\r\nappalling gestures. The neck veins of the fighters swelled and their\r\nfaces flamed with mock defiance. Their agility in escaping descending\r\nblades was amazing. But the _ki-ai_ player's dexterity is famous. It\r\nis his boast that with his sword he could cut a straw on a friend's\r\nhead. I noticed that no women were present at the \"spirit meeting.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once I found that my landlord host was accustomed to make a\r\ncircuit of his village once or twice a week in order to see how things\r\nwere going with his tenants. Public-spirited landlords were working\r\nfor their people by means of co-operation, lectures and prizes, the\r\ndistribution of leaflets and the giving of from 2-1/2 to 7-1/2 per\r\ncent. discount in rent when good rice was produced. The rural\r\nphilanthropist in Japan sees himself as the father of his village.[32]\r\nThe Japanese word for landlord is \"land master\" and for tenant \"son\r\ntiller.\" The old idea was patronage on the one side and respect on the\r\nother. This idea is disappearing. \"We wish,\" said one landlord to me,\r\n\"to pass through the transition stage gradually. We do not feel the\r\nsame responsibility to our people, perhaps, now that they do not show\r\nthe same reverence for us, but we do not say to them that they may go\r\nto the factory and we will invest our money for our children. We check\r\nourselves. We know well, however, that things will change in our\r\ngrandsons' time. We therefore try to mix our grandfathers' ideas and\r\nmodern ideas. We are believers in co-operation and we try to be\r\ncounsellors and to work behind the curtain.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there are such things as tenants' strikes. Mr.\r\nYamasaki assured me that the problem of the rural districts can be\r\nsolved only by appealing to the feelings of the people in the right\r\nway. He said that \"the Japanese are largely moved by feelings, not by\r\nconvictions.\" In some coastwise counties, someone told me, a hurricane\r\ndestroyed the crops to such an extent that the tenants could not pay\r\nrent, and the landlords who depended on their rents were impoverished.\r\nThings reached such a pass that a hundred thousand peasants signed a\r\npaper swearing fidelity to an anti-landlord propaganda. Officials and\r\nlawyers achieved nothing. Then Mr. Yamasaki went, and, sitting in the\r\nlocal temple, talked things over with both sides for days. He got the\r\nlandlords to say that they were sorry for their tenants and the\r\ntenants to say that they were sorry for the landlords, and eventually\r\nhe was allowed to burn the oath-attested document in the temple.[33]\r\n\r\nMany landlords are \"endeavouring to cultivate a moral relation\"\r\nbetween themselves and their tenants. They have often the advantage\r\nthat their ancestors were the landlords of the same peasant families\r\nfor many generations. But there are still plenty of absentee landlords\r\nand landlords who are usurers. There are also the landlords who have\r\nlet their lands to middlemen. The cultivator therefore pays out of all\r\nproportion to what the landlord receives. Of landlords generally, an\r\nex-daimyo's son said to me: \"Many landlords treat their tenants\r\ncruelly. The rent enforced is too high. In place of the intimate\r\nrelations of former days the relations are now that of cat and dog.\r\nThe ignorance of the landlords is the cause of this state of things.\r\nIt is very important that the landlord's son shall go to the\r\nagricultural school, where there is plenty of practical work which\r\nwill bring the perspiration from him.\" The object of most good\r\nlandlords is to increase the income of their tenants. It is felt that\r\nunless the farmers have more money in their hands, progress is\r\nimpossible. There is one direction in which the landlords are not\r\ntried. The franchise is so narrow that farmers cannot vote against\r\ntheir landlords.\r\n\r\nIn the house of one old landowning family in which I was a guest I saw\r\na _gaku_ inscribed, \"Happiness comes to the house whose ancestors were\r\nvirtuous.\" I was admitted to the family shrine. Round the walls of the\r\nsmall apartment in which the shrine stood were the autographs or\r\nportraits of distinguished members of the house going back four or\r\nfive hundred years. It was easy to see that the inspiring force of\r\nthis family was its untarnished name. It was a crime against the\r\nancestors to reduce the prestige or merit of the family. No stronger\r\ninfluence could be exerted upon an erring member of such a family than\r\nto be brought by his father or elder brother before the family shrine\r\nand there reprimanded in the presence of the ancestral spirits. The\r\nhead of this house is at present a schoolboy of twelve and the\r\ngovernment of the family is in the hands of a \"regent,\" the lad's\r\nuncle. I saw the boy and his younger sister trot off in the morning\r\nwith their satchels on their backs to the village school in democratic\r\nJapanese fashion. Japan is a much more democratic country than the\r\ntourist imagines. Distinctions of class are accompanied by easy\r\nrelations in many important matters.\r\n\r\nI went for a second time to the restful city of Nagoya. It is out of\r\nthe sphere of influence of Tokyo and is conservative of old ideas.\r\nPeople live with less display than in the capital and perhaps pride\r\nthemselves on doing so. But if the houses of even the well-to-do are\r\nsmall and inconspicuous, the interiors are of satisfying quality in\r\nmaterials and workmanship, and the family godowns bring forth\r\nsurprises. Here as elsewhere the guest is served in treasured lacquer\r\nand porcelain. (While we are not accustomed in the West to look at the\r\nmarks on our host's table silver, it is perfect Japanese manners to\r\nadmire a food bowl by examining the potter's marks.) My host hung a\r\nrural _kakemono_ in my room, one day a fine old study of poultry,\r\nanother an equally beautiful painting of hollyhocks.\r\n\r\nAs we left the town my attention was attracted by a commemorative\r\nstone overlooking rice fields. The inscription proclaimed the fact\r\nthat at that spot the late Emperor Meiji,[34] as a lad of fifteen, on\r\nhis historic first journey to Tokyo, \"beheld the farmers reaping.\"\r\n\r\nThe matron of a farmhouse two centuries old showed me a tub containing\r\ntiny carp which she had hatched for her carp pond, the inmates of\r\nwhich, as is common, came to be fed when she clapped her hands. In the\r\ngarden there was an old clay butt still used for archery. In the\r\nfarmhouse I was taken into a room in which in the old days the daimyo\r\noverlord had rested, into another room which had a secret door and\r\ninto a third room where--an electric fan was buzzing.\r\n\r\nAt a school I had to face the usual ordeal of having to \"write\" as\r\nbest I could a motto for use as a wall picture. Our lettering, when\r\ndone with a brush, falls pitifully behind Chinese characters in\r\ndecorative value, and our mottoes will not readily translate into\r\nJapanese. I was often grateful to Henley for \"I am the master of my\r\nfate, I am the captain of my soul,\" because with the substitution of\r\n\"commander\" for captain, the lines translate literally.\r\n\r\nWe left the village through arches which had been erected by the young\r\nmen's association. At an old country house four interesting things\r\nwere shown to me. There was, first, a phial of rice seed 230 years\r\nold. The agricultural professor who was my fellow-guest told me that\r\nhe had germinated some of the grains, but they did not produce rice\r\nplants. The second thing was a fine family shrine before which a\r\nreligious ceremony had been performed twice a day by succeeding\r\ngenerations of the same family for 350 years. The third object of\r\ninterest was a little, narrow, flat steel dagger about eight inches\r\nlong, sheathed in the scabbard of a sword. The dagger was used for\r\n\"fastening an enemy's head on.\" After the owner of the sword had\r\nbeheaded his foe, he drew the smaller weapon, and, thrusting one end\r\ninto the headless trunk and the other end into the base of the head,\r\npolitely united head and body once more, thus making it possible \"to\r\nshow due respect and sympathy towards the dead.\" Finally, I had the\r\nprivilege of handling a wonderful suit of armour which was fitted\r\nslowly together for me out of many pieces. Although it had been made\r\nseveral centuries ago, this rich suit of lacquered leather had been a\r\nJapanese general's wear on the field of battle within living memory.\r\n\r\nOne of the landowners I met was a poet who had been successful in the\r\nImperial poem competition which is held every New Year. A subject is\r\nset by His Majesty and the thousands of pieces sent in are submitted\r\nto a committee. The dozen best productions are read before the\r\nsovereign himself, and this is the honour sought by the competitors.\r\nThe subject for competition in the year in which the landowner had\r\nbeen successful was, \"The cryptomeria in a temple court.\" His poem was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n        In transplanting\r\n        The young cryptomeria trees\r\n        Within the sacred fence\r\n        There is a symbol\r\n        Of the beginning of the reign.\r\n\r\nThe New Year poems come from every class of the community and there\r\nis seldom a year in which landowners or farmers are not among the\r\nfortunate twelve.\r\n\r\nAs we rode along a companion spoke of the force of public opinion in\r\nkeeping things straight in the countryside, also of the far-reaching\r\ncontrol exercised by fathers and elder brothers. But the good\r\nbehaviour of some people was due, he said, to a dread of being\r\nridiculed in the newspapers, which allow themselves extraordinary\r\nfreedom in dealing with reputations.\r\n\r\nI met a man who had had a monument erected to him. He was a member of\r\na little company which received me in a farmer's house. He was\r\nformerly the richest man in the village, that is to say, he owned 20\r\n_chō_ and was worth about 100,000 yen. Moved by the poverty of his\r\nneighbours, he devoted his substance to improving their condition. Now\r\nmany of them are well off, the village has been \"praised and rewarded\"\r\nby the prefecture for its \"good farming and good morals,\" and the\r\nphilanthropist is worth only 50,000 yen. Impressed by his\r\nunselfishness, the village has raised a great slab of stone in his\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nI made enquiries continually about the influence exerted by priests. I\r\nwas told of many \"careless\" priests, but also of others who delivered\r\nsermons of a practical sort. A few of the younger priests were\r\ndescribed as \"philosophical\" and some preached \"the kingdom of God is\r\nwithin you.\" Many people laid stress on the necessity for a better\r\neducation of the priesthood and for combating superstition among the\r\npeasantry, though the schools had already had a powerful influence in\r\nshaking the faith of thousands of the common people in charms and\r\nsuchlike. Many folk put up charms because it was the custom or to\r\nplease their old parents or because it could do no harm.\r\n\r\nI was told that the Government does not encourage the erection of new\r\ntemples. Its notion is that it is better to maintain the existing\r\ntemples adequately. When I went to see a gorgeous new temple, I found\r\nthat official permission for its erection had been obtained because\r\nthe figures, vessels and some of the fittings of an old and\r\ndilapidated temple were to be used in the new edifice. This temple\r\nwas on a large tract of land which had recently been recovered from\r\nthe sea. The building had cost between 80,000 and 90,000 yen. It stood\r\non piles on rising ground and had a secondary purpose in that it\r\noffered a place of refuge to the settlers on the new land if the sea\r\ndike should break.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the temple was the man who had drained the land and\r\nestablished the colony. He had given an endowment of 500 yen a year,\r\nthree-quarters of which was for the priest. This functionary had also\r\nan income of 150 yen from a _chō_ of land attached to the temple.\r\nFurther he received gifts of rice and vegetables. I noticed that the\r\ngifts of rice--acknowledged on a list hung up in his house--varied in\r\nquantity from four pecks to half a cupful. Probably the priest bought\r\nvery little of anything. If he needed matting for his house, which was\r\nattached to the temple, or if he had to make a journey, the villagers\r\nsaw that his requirements were met. And he was always getting presents\r\nof one kind or another. \"A man says to the priest,\" I was told, \"'This\r\nis too good for me; please accept it.'\" The villagers on their side\r\nsat and smoked in one of the temple rooms and drank his reverence's\r\ntea for hours before and after service.[35]\r\n\r\nThe building of the temple was not only an act of piety but a work of\r\ncommercial necessity. The colonists on the reclaimed land would never\r\nhave settled there if there had not been a temple to hold them to the\r\nplace and to provide burial rites for their old parents. Not all the\r\npeople were of the same sect of Buddhism, but \"they gradually came\r\ntogether.\" A third of what a tenant produced went for rent and another\r\nthird for fertilisers, the remaining third being his own. The\r\npopulation was 1,800 in 300 families. The average area per family was\r\n2 _chō_ and colonists were expected to start with about 200 yen of\r\ncapital. Some unpromising tenants had been sent away and \"some had\r\nleft secretly.\" Half of the people were in debt to the landlord--the\r\ntotal indebtedness was about 15,000 yen--for the erection of houses\r\nand the purchase of implements and stock. The rate was 8 per cent. In\r\nthe district 10 per cent. was quite usual and 12 per cent. by no means\r\nrare. The co-operative society lent at the daily rate of 2-1/2 sen per\r\n100 yen.\r\n\r\nThe landlord told me that the sea dikes took two years to build and\r\nthat most of the earth was carried by women, 5,000 of them. Their\r\nlabour was cheap and the small quantities of earth which each woman\r\nbrought at a time permitted of a better consolidation of an embankment\r\nthat was 240 feet wide at the base. More than a million yen were laid\r\nout on the work. The reclaimed land was free of State taxes for half a\r\ncentury, but the landlord made a voluntary gift to the village of\r\n2,000 yen a year. The yearly rent coming in was already nearly 56,000\r\nyen. The cost of the management of the drained land and of repairs to\r\nthe embankment, 20,000 yen a year, was just met by the profits of a\r\nfishpond. A valuable edible seaweed industry was carried on outside\r\nthe sea dikes. The landlord mentioned that he had had great difficulty\r\nin overcoming the objections of his grandfather to the investment, but\r\nthat eventually the old man got so much interested that at\r\nninety-three he used to march about giving orders.\r\n\r\nOne day in the course of my journeying I was near a railway station\r\nwhere country people had assembled to watch the passing of a train by\r\nwhich the Emperor was travelling. No one was permitted along the line\r\nexcept at specified points which were carefully watched. A young\r\nconstable who wore a Russian war medal was opposite the spot where I\r\nstood. He politely asked me to keep one _shaku_ (foot) or so away from\r\nthe paling. When someone's child pushed itself half-way through the\r\npaling the police instruction was, \"Please keep back the little one\r\nfor, if it should pass through, other children will no doubt wish to\r\nfollow.\" A later request by the constable was to take off our hats and\r\nkeep silence when he raised his hand on the approach of the Imperial\r\ntrain. We were further asked not to point at the Emperor and on no\r\naccount to cry Banzai. (The Japanese shout _Banzai_ for the Emperor in\r\nhis absence and cry _Banzai_ to victorious generals and admirals, but\r\nperfect silence is considered the most respectful way of greeting the\r\nEmperor himself.) The Imperial train, which was preceded by a pilot\r\nengine drawing a van full of rather anxious-looking police, slowed\r\ndown on approaching the station so that everyone had a chance of\r\nseeing the Emperor, who was facing us. All the school children of the\r\ndistrict had been marshalled where they could get a good view. The\r\nJapanese bow of greatest respect--it has been introduced since the\r\nRestoration, I was told--is an inclination of the head so slight that\r\nit does not prevent the person who bows seeing his superior. This bow\r\nwhen made by rows of people is impressive. Undoubtedly the crowd was\r\nmoved by the sight of its sovereign. Not a few people held their hands\r\ntogether in front of them in an attitude of devotion. The day before I\r\nhad happened to see first a priest and then a professor examining a\r\nmagazine which had a portrait of the Emperor as frontispiece. Both\r\nbowed slightly to the print. Coloured portraits of the Emperor and\r\nEmpress are on sale in the shops, but in many cases there is a little\r\nsquare of tissue paper over the Imperial countenances.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] _Shoji_ are the screens which divide a room from the outside.\r\nThey are a dainty wooden framework of many divisions, each of which is\r\ncovered by a sheet of thin white paper. The _shoji_ provide light and\r\nare never painted. The sliding doors between two rooms are _karakami\r\n(fusuma_ is a literary word). They are a wooden framework with thick\r\npaper or cloth on both sides of it and with paper packing between the\r\nlayers. _Karakami_ are often decorated with writing or may be painted.\r\nNo light passes through them.\r\n\r\n[31] A writing or a picture on a long perpendicular strip of paper or\r\nsilk or of paper mounted on silk, with rollers. The length is about\r\nthree times the width, which is usually 1 ft. 3 in. or 1 ft. 10 in.\r\nThe _kakemono_ in the _tokonoma_ of tea-ceremony rooms is about 10 in.\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n[32] For budgets of large property owners, see Appendix III.\r\n\r\n[33] There have been several serious tenants' demonstrations in Aichi\r\nduring 1921. See Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n[34] Each Emperor receives on his succession a name which is applied\r\nto the period of his reign. The period of Mutsuhito's reign,\r\n1868-1912, is called _Meiji_; that of the present Emperor _Taisho_.\r\nThus the year 1912 would be _Taisho_ I.\r\n\r\n[35] It will be remembered that there is only one prefecture in which\r\ntea is not grown in larger or smaller areas, and that it is served\r\neconomically without sugar or milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBEFORE OKUNITAMA-NO-MIKO-NO-KAMI[36]\r\n\r\nNor do I see why we should take it for granted that their gods are\r\nunworthy of respect.--_Valerius_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Aichi prefecture I was asked to plant trees (persimmons) in the\r\ngrounds of three temples or shrines and on the land of several\r\nfarmers. In an exposed position on a hill-top I found persimmons being\r\ngrown on a system under which the landlord provided the land, trees\r\nand manures and the farmer the labour, and the produce was equally\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nThe cryptomeria at one of the shrines I visited were of great age. All\r\nof them had lost their tops by lightning. It cannot be easy for those\r\nwho have never seen cryptomeria or the redwoods of California to\r\nrealise the impression made by dark giant trees that have stood before\r\nsome shrine for generations. At the approach to the shrine of which I\r\nspeak there were venerable wooden statues. I recall one figure carved\r\nin wood as full of life as that of the famous Egyptian headman.\r\n\r\nThe aged chief priest, who was assisted by two younger priests, kindly\r\ninvited me to take part in a Shinto service. First, I ceremonially\r\nwashed my hands and rinsed my mouth. Then, having ascended the steps,\r\nmy shoes were removed for me so that my hands should not be defiled.\r\nOn entering the shrine I knelt opposite the young priests, one of whom\r\nbrought me the usual evergreen bough with paper streamers. On\r\nreceiving it I rose to my feet, passed through the beautiful building\r\nand advanced to what I may call, for the lack of a more accurate term,\r\nthe altar table. On this table, which, as is usual in Shinto\r\nceremonies, was of new white wood following the ancient design, I laid\r\nthe offering. Then I bowed and gave the customary three smart\r\nhand-claps which summon the attention of the deity of the shrine, and\r\nbowed again. On returning to my former kneeling-place one of the\r\npriests offered me _saké_ and a small piece of dried fish in\r\npaper.[37] The chief priest was good enough to read and to hand to me\r\nan address headed, \"Words of Congratulation to the Investigator,\"\r\nwhich may be Englished as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I, Yukimichi Otsu, the chief priest, speak most respectfully and\r\nreverently before the shrine of the august deity,\r\nOkunitama-no-miko-no-kami, and other deities here enshrined: Dr.\r\nRobertson Scott, of England, is here this good day. He comes to see\r\nthe things of Japan under the governance of our gracious Emperor. I,\r\nhaving made myself quite pure and clean, open the door of gracious\r\neyes that they may look upon those who are here. May Dr. Robertson\r\nScott be protected during night and day, no accident happening\r\nwherever he may go. Dr. Robertson Scott goes everywhere in this\r\ncountry; he may cross a hundred rivers and pass over many hills. May\r\nthere be no foundering of his boat, no stumbling of his horse.\r\nOffering produce of land and sea, I say this most respectfully before\r\nthe shrine.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the shrine I visited a co-operative store, curiously reminiscent\r\nof many a similar rural enterprise I had seen in Denmark. Sugar,\r\ncoarser than anything sold at home, was dear. Half the price paid for\r\nsugar in Japan is tax. I was informed that there were no fewer than\r\n400 cooperative organisations in the prefecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTHOR QUESTIONING OFFICIALS--]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AND PLANTING COMMEMORATIVE TREES]\r\n\r\nAt several places, although the villagers were busy rice planting, the\r\nyoung men's association turned out. The young men were reinforced by\r\nreservists and came sharply to attention as our _kuruma_\r\n(_jinrikisha_, usually pneumatic-tyred) passed. Some of the villages\r\nwe bowled through were off the ordinary track, and the older villagers\r\nobserved the ancient custom of coming out from their houses or farm\r\nplots, dropping on their knees and bowing low as we passed.[38] All\r\nover Japan, a villager encountered on the road removed the towel from\r\nhis head before bowing. If a cloak or outer coat was worn, it was\r\ntaken off or the motion of taking it off was made. Frequently, in\r\nshowery weather, cyclists who were wearing mackintoshes or capes,\r\nalighted and removed these outer garments before saluting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICE POLISHING BY FOOT POWER.]\r\n\r\nI saw a village which a few years ago had been \"disorderly and poor\"\r\nand in continual friction with its landlord. Eventually this man\r\nrealised his responsibility, and, inspired by Mr. Yamasaki, took the\r\nsituation in hand. He talked in a straightforward way with his\r\nvillagers, reduced a number of rents and spent money freely in\r\nameliorative work. To-day the village is \"remarkable for its good\r\nconduct\" and the relation between landlord and tenant seems to be\r\neverything that can be desired. The landlord is not only the moving\r\nspirit of the co-operative store but has started a school for girls of\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty. They bring their own food but the schooling is\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nOn the gables of one or two houses near the roof I noticed ventilators\r\nwhich were cut in the form of the Chinese ideograph which means water,\r\na kind of charm against fire. At the door of one rather well-to-do\r\npeasant house I saw several paper charms against toothache. There was\r\nalso an inscription intimating that the householder was a director of\r\nthe co-operative society and another announcing that he was an expert\r\nin the application of the moxa.[39] Every house I went into had a\r\ncollection of charms. One charm, a verse of poetry hung upside-down,\r\nas is the custom, was against ants. Another was understood to ensure\r\nthe safe return of a straying cat.\r\n\r\nIn one house in the village my attention was drawn to the fact that\r\nthe rice pot contained a large percentage of barley.\r\n\r\nIn two or three places I passed pits for the excavation of lignite,\r\nwhich does not look unlike the wood taken out of bogs. A pit I stopped\r\nat was twenty-two fathoms deep. There were twenty miners at work and\r\nair was being pumped down.\r\n\r\nOne of the things we in the West might imitate with advantage is the\r\nvillage crematorium. In Japan it is of the simplest construction. The\r\nrate for villagers was 50 sen, that for outsiders 2 yen. No doubt\r\nthere would be an additional yen for the priest. In a little building\r\nwhich was thirty years old 200 bodies had been cremated.\r\n\r\nI looked into a small co-operative rice storehouse. The building was\r\nprovided by a number of members \"swearing\" to save at the rate of a\r\nyen and a half a month each until the funds needed had accumulated.\r\nThe money was obtained by extra labour in the evening. Just before I\r\nleft Japan the Department of Agriculture was arranging to spend 2\r\nmillion yen within a ten-years' period to encourage the building of\r\n4,000 rice storehouses.\r\n\r\nAs I watched the water pouring from one rice field to another and\r\nwondered how the rights of landowners were ever reconciled, someone\r\nreminded me of the phrase, \"water splashing quarrels,\" that is\r\ndisputes in which each side blames the other without getting any\r\nfarther forward. To take an unfair advantage in controversy is to draw\r\nwater into one's own paddy. The equivalent for \"pouring water on a\r\nduck's back\" is \"flinging water in a frog's face.\" A Western European\r\nis always astonished in Japan by the lung power of Far Eastern frogs.\r\nThe noise is not unlike the bleating of lambs.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again one comes on a fragrant bed of lotus in its paddy\r\nfield. It seems odd at first that lotus--and burdock--should be\r\ncultivated for food. As a pickle burdock is eatable, but lotus and\r\nsome unfamiliar tuberous plants are pleasant food resembling in\r\nflavour boiled chestnuts. _Konnyaku_ (_hydrosme rivieri_), a near\r\nrelative of the arum lily, is produced to the weight of 11 million\r\n_kwan_--a _kwan_ is roughly 8-1/4 lbs.[40] The yield of burdock is\r\nabout 44 million _kwan_. The chief of all vegetables is the giant\r\nradish, of which 7-1/4 million _kwan_ are grown. Taro yields about 150\r\nmillion _kwan_. Foreigners usually like the young sprouts taken from\r\nthe roots of the bamboo, a favourite Japanese vegetable.\r\n\r\nThis is as convenient a place as any to speak of an important\r\nagricultural fact, the enormous amount of filth worked into the\r\npaddies. As is well known, hardly any of the night soil of Japan is\r\nwasted. Japanese agriculture depends upon it. Formerly the night soil\r\nwas removed from the houses after being emptied into a pair of tubs\r\nwhich the peasant carried from a yoke. Such yoke-carried tubs are\r\nstill seen, but are chiefly employed in carrying the substance to the\r\npaddies. The tubs which are taken to dwellings are now mostly borne on\r\nlight two-wheeled handcarts which carry sometimes four and sometimes\r\nsix. A farmer will push or pull his manure cart from a town ten or\r\ntwelve miles off. It is difficult to leave or enter a town without\r\nmeeting strings of manure carts. The men who haul the carts get\r\ntogether for company on their tedious journey. They seem insensible to\r\nthe concentrated odour. Often the wife or son or daughter may be seen\r\npushing behind a cart. There is a certain amount of transportation by\r\nhorse-drawn frame carts, carrying a dozen or sixteen tubs, and by\r\nboats. I was told of a city of half a million inhabitants which had\r\nthirty per cent. of its night soil taken ten miles away. The work was\r\nundertaken by a co-operative society which paid the municipality the\r\nlarge sum of 70,000 yen a year. The removal of night soil, its storage\r\nin the fields in sunken butts and concrete cisterns--carefully\r\nprotected by thatched, wooden or concrete roofs--and its constant\r\napplication to paddy fields or upland plots cause an odour to prevail\r\nwhich the visitor to Japan never forgets.[41]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that, because the Japanese are careful to\r\nutilise human waste products, no other manure is employed. There is an\r\nenormous consumption of chemical fertilisers. Then there are brought\r\ninto service all sorts of crop-feeding materials, such as straw,\r\ngrass, compost, silkworm waste, fish waste, and of course the manure\r\nproduced by such stock as is kept.[42] In Aichi the value of human\r\nwaste products used on the land is only a quarter of the value of the\r\nbean cake and fish waste similarly employed.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Yamasaki's excellent agricultural school (prefectural), which\r\nI visited more than once,[43] I was struck by the grave bearing of the\r\nstudents. I saw them not only in their classrooms but in their large\r\nhall, where I was invited to speak from a platform between the busts\r\nof two rural worthies, Ninomiya, of whom we have heard before, and\r\nanother who was \"distinguished by the righteousness of his public\r\ncareer.\" As in the Danish rural high schools, store is set on hard\r\nphysical exercise. An hour of exercise--_judō_ (jujitsu), sword play\r\nor military drill--is taken from six to seven in the morning and\r\nanother at midday with the object of \"strengthening the spirit\" and\r\n\"developing the character,\" for \"our farmers must not only be honest\r\nand determined but courageous.\" Severe physical labour, shared by the\r\nteacher, is also given out of doors, for example, in heaping manure.\r\n\"We believe,\" said one of the instructors, \"in moral virtue taught by\r\nthe hands.\"\r\n\r\nFor an hour a day \"the main points of moral virtue\" are put before the\r\ndifferent grades of students, according to their ages and development.\r\nThe school has a guild to which the twenty teachers and all the\r\nstudents belong. It is a kind of co-operative society for the\r\n\"purchase and distribution of daily necessities,\" but one of its\r\nobjects is \"the maintenance of public morality.\" Then there is the\r\nstudents' association which has literary and gymnastic sides, the one\r\nside \"to refine wisdom and virtue,\" the other \"for the rousing of\r\nspirit.\" Mention may also be made of a \"discipline calendar\" of fixed\r\nmemorial days and ceremonies \"that all the students should observe\":\r\nthe ceremony of reading the Imperial Rescript on education, thrift and\r\nmorality, and the ceremonies at the end of rice planting, at harvest\r\nand at the maturity of the silk-worm. The fitting-up of the school is\r\nSpartan but the rooms are high and well lighted and ventilated. The\r\nstudents' hot bath accommodates a dozen lads at a time. The studies\r\nare also the dormitories, and in the corner of each there is stored a\r\nbig mosquito netting. Except for a few square yards near the doors,\r\nthese rooms consist of the usual raised platform covered with the\r\nnational _tatami_ or matting.\r\n\r\nI heard a characteristic story of the Director. During the\r\nRusso-Japanese war everybody was economising, and many people who had\r\nbeen in the habit of riding in _kuruma_ began to walk. Our\r\nagricultural celebrity had always had a passion for walking, so it was\r\nout of his power to economise in _kuruma_. What he did was to cease\r\nwalking and take to _kuruma_ riding, for, he said, \"in war time one\r\nmust work one's utmost, and if I move about quickly I can get more\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nI may add a story which this rare man himself told me. I had seen in\r\nhis house a photograph of a memorial slab celebrating the heroic death\r\nof a peasant. It appeared that in a period of scarcity there was left\r\nin this peasant's village only one unbroken bale of rice. This rice\r\nwas in the possession of the peasant, who was suffering from lack of\r\nfood. But he would not cook any of the rice because he knew that if he\r\ndid the village would be without seed in spring. Eventually the brave\r\nman was found dead of hunger in his cottage. His pillow had been the\r\nunopened bale of rice.\r\n\r\nIn the house of a small peasant proprietor I visited the inscriptions\r\non the two _gaku_ signified \"Buddha's teaching broken by a beautiful\r\nface\" and \"Cast your eyes on high.\" On the wall there was also a copy\r\nof a resolution concerning a recent Imperial Rescript which 500 rural\r\nhouseholders, at a meeting in the county, had \"sworn to observe,\" and,\r\nas I understood, to read two or three times a year.\r\n\r\nJapan, as I have already noted, has always been a more democratic\r\ncountry than is generally understood; but the people have been\r\naccustomed to act under leaders. Some time ago an official of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture visited a certain district in order to speak\r\nat the local temple in advocacy of the adjustment of rice fields. (See\r\nChapter VIII.) A dignitary corresponding to the chairman of an English\r\ncounty council was at the temple to receive the official, but at the\r\ntime appointed for the meeting to begin the audience consisted of one\r\nold man. Although the official from Tokyo and the _gunchō_ (head of a\r\ncounty) waited for some time, no one else put in an appearance. So\r\nthey asked the old man the reason. He replied by asking them the\r\nobject of the meeting. They told him. He said that he had so\r\nunderstood and that the community had so understood, but the farmers\r\nwere very busy men. Therefore, as he was the oldest man in the\r\ndistrict, they had sent him as their representative. Their\r\ninstructions were that he would be able to tell from his experience of\r\nthe district whether what the authorities proposed would be a good\r\nthing for it or not. If he considered it to be a bad thing they would\r\nnot do it, but if he thought it to be a good thing they would do it.\r\nHe was to hear all that was said and then to give a decision on the\r\ncommunity's behalf to the officials who might attend. \"So,\" said the\r\nold man to the Tokyo official and the _gunchō_, \"if you convince me\r\nyou have convinced the village.\" And after two hours' explanation they\r\nconvinced him!\r\n\r\nThere are in Japan hydraulic engineering works as remarkable in their\r\nway as any I have seen in the Netherlands. Some of these works, for\r\nexample the tunnels for conducting rice-field water through\r\nconsiderable hills, have been the work of unlettered peasants. In one\r\nplace I found that 80 miles or more of irrigation was based on a canal\r\nmade two centuries ago. It is good to see so many embankings of\r\nrefractory streams and excavations of river beds commemorated by slabs\r\nrecording the public services of the men who, often at their own\r\ncharges, carried out these works of general utility.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the country I came upon smallholders who had\r\nreached a high degree of proficiency in the fine art of dwarfing\r\ntrees. One day I stopped to speak with a farmer who by this art had\r\nadded 1,000 yen a year to his agricultural income. A thirty-years-old\r\nmaple was one of his triumphs. Another was a pomegranate about a foot\r\nand a half high. It was in flower and would bear fruit of ordinary\r\nsize. The wonder of dwarfing is wrought, as is now well known, by\r\ncramping the roots in the pot and by extremely skilful pruning,\r\nmanuring and watering. While we drank tea some choice specimens were\r\ndisplayed before a screen of unrelieved gold. In the room in which we\r\nsat the farmer had arranged in a bowl of water with great\r\neffectiveness hydrangea, a spray of pomegranate and a cabbage.\r\n\r\nOne marks the respect shown to the rural policeman. In his summer\r\nuniform of white cotton, with his flat white cap and white gloves, and\r\nan imposing sword, he looks like a naval officer, even if, as\r\nsometimes happens, his feet are in _zori_. He gets respect because of\r\nhis dignified presence and sense of official duty, because of the\r\nconsiderable powers which he is able to exercise, because he stands\r\nfor the Government, and because he is sometimes of a higher social\r\ngrade than that to which policemen belong in other countries. At the\r\nRestoration many men of the samurai class did not think it beneath\r\nthem to enter the new sword-wearing police force and they helped to\r\ngive it a standing which has been maintained. As to the policeman\r\nbeing a representative of the Government, the ordinary Japanese has a\r\nway of speaking of the Government doing this or that as if the\r\nGovernment were irresistible power. Average Japanese do not yet\r\nconceive the Government as something which they have made and may\r\nunmake[44]. But is it likely that they should, parliamentary history,\r\nthe work of their betters, being as short as it is? It is not whithout\r\nsignificance that the Chambers of the Diet are housed in temporary\r\nwooden buildings.\r\n\r\nThe rural policeman is not only a paternal guardian of the peace but\r\nan administrative official. He keeps an eye on public health. He is\r\ncharged with correctly maintaining the record of names and\r\naddresses--and some other particulars--of everybody in the village. It\r\nis his duty to secure correct information as to the name, age, place\r\nof origin and real business of every stranger. He attends all public\r\nmeetings, even of the young men's and young women's associations, and\r\nno strolling players can give their entertainment without his\r\npresence. As to the movements of strangers, my own were obviously well\r\nknown. Indeed a friend told me that in the event of my losing myself I\r\nhad only to ask a policeman and he would be able to tell me where I\r\nwas expected next! At the houses of well-to-do people I was struck by\r\nthe way in which the local police officer--sometimes, no doubt, a\r\nsergeant or perhaps a man of the rank of our superintendent or chief\r\nconstable--called with the headman and joined our kneeling circle in\r\nthe reception-room. Nominally he came to pay his respects, but his\r\nchief object, no doubt, was to take stock of what was going on. I\r\ninvariably took the opportunity of closely interviewing him.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary degree to which Japanese are commonly accustomed in\r\ntheir differences of opinion to refrain from blows makes many of their\r\nquarrels harmless. The threat to send for the policeman or the actual\r\nappearance of the policeman has an almost magical effect in calming a\r\ndisturbance. The Japanese policeman believes very much in reproving or\r\nreprimanding evil doers and in reasoning with folk whose\r\n\"carelessness\" has attracted attention. Sometimes for greater\r\nimpressiveness the admonitions or exhortations are delivered at the\r\npolice station[45]. In more than one village I heard a tribute paid to\r\nthe good influence exerted on a community by a devoted policeman.\r\n\r\nThe chief of an agricultural experiment station also seems to obtain a\r\nlarge measure of respect, to some extent, no doubt, because he\r\noccupies a public office. The regard felt for Mr. Yamasaki goes\r\ndeeper. A few years ago he was sent on a mission abroad and in his\r\nabsence his local admirers cast about for a way of showing their\r\nappreciation of his work. They began by raising what was described to\r\nme as \"naturally not a large but an honourable sum.\" With this money\r\nthey decided to add three rooms to his dwelling. They had noted how\r\nvisitors were always coming to his house in order to profit by his\r\nexperience and advice. Mr. Yamasaki uses the rooms primarily as \"an\r\nhotel for people of good intentions--those who work for better\r\nconditions.\" I was proud to stay at this \"hotel\" and to receive as a\r\nparting gift an old _seppuku_ blade.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me that one night at a house in the country I found\r\nmyself sitting under photographs of the late General and Countess Nogi\r\nand of the gaunt bloodstained room of the depressing \"foreign style\"\r\nhouse in which they committed suicide on the day of the funeral of\r\nthe Emperor Meiji[46]. One of my fellow-guests was a professor at the\r\nImperial University; the other was a teacher of lofty and unselfish\r\nspirit. They were both samurai. I mentioned that a man of worth and\r\ndistinction has said to me that, while he recognised the nobility of\r\nNogi's action, he could but not think it unjustifiable. I was at once\r\ntold that Japanese who do not approve of Nogi's action \"must be\r\nover-influenced by Western thought.\" \"Those who are quintessentially\r\nJapanese,\" it was explained, \"think that Nogi did right. Bodily death\r\nis nothing, for Nogi still lives among us as a spirit. He labours with\r\na stronger influence. Many hearts were purified by his sacrifice. One\r\nof Nogi's reasons for suicide was no doubt that he might be able to\r\nfollow his beloved Emperor, but his intention was also to warn many\r\nvicious or unpatriotic people. Some politicians and rich people say\r\nthey are patriotic, but they are animated by selfish motives and\r\ndesires. Nogi's suicide was due to his loving his fellow-countrymen\r\nsincerely. Surely he was acting after the manner of Christ. Nogi\r\ncrucified himself for the people in order to atone in a measure for\r\ntheir sins and to lead them to a better way of life.\"\r\n\r\nI heard from my friends something of Nogi's demeanour. The old general\r\nwas a familiar figure in Tokyo. In the street cars--those were the\r\ndays when they were not over-crowded--he was always seen standing. His\r\nadmirers used to say that his face \"beamed with beneficence.\" But\r\nNogi, though he loved to be within reach of the Emperor and did his\r\npart as head of the Peers' School, liked nothing better than to get\r\naway to the country. He was originally a peasant and he still\r\npossessed a _chō_ of upland holding. He was glad to work on it with\r\nthe digging mattock of the farmer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] Son-God-of-the-Spirit-of-the-Province.\r\n\r\n[37] It was a tiny squid. There are seventy sorts of cuttlefish and\r\noctopuses in Japanese waters. Value of dried cuttlefish in 1917, 4\r\nmillion yen.\r\n\r\n[38] The hands are laid flat on the ground with finger-tips meeting\r\nand the forehead touches the hands.\r\n\r\n[39] See Chapter XX.\r\n\r\n[40] The root grows to about the size of a big apple. It may be seen\r\nin the shops in white dried sections. A stiff greyish jelly made from\r\nit is eaten with rice. It is also eaten as _oden_ or _dengaku_.\r\n\r\n[41] See Appendix IV.\r\n\r\n[42] See Appendix XX.\r\n\r\n[43] See Appendix V.\r\n\r\n[44] The truth is being learnt by the younger generation.\r\n\r\n[45] For crime statistics, see Appendix VI.\r\n\r\n[46] _Harakiri_ (_seppuku_ is the polite word) still happens. Just\r\nbefore writing this note I read of the captain of the first company of\r\nthe Japanese garrison in a Korean town having committed _seppuku_\r\nbecause of a sense of responsibility for the irregularities of\r\nsubordinates. But of 7,239 suicides of men in 1916 only 308 were by\r\ncold steel. Of 4,558 cases of women suicides 140 were by steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOF \"DEVIL-GON\" AND YOSOGI\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of a common purpose in mankind, or even the\r\nacknowledgment that such a common purpose is possible, would alter the\r\nface of world politics at once.--GRAHAM WALLAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a bad landlord who was nicknamed \"Devil-gon.\" He was shot.\r\nThere was another bad landlord who, as he was crossing a narrow bridge\r\nover a brook, was \"pistolled through the sleeve and tumbled into the\r\nwater.\" Although the murderer was well known, his name was never\r\nrevealed to the police, and the family of the dead man was glad to\r\nleave the district. The villagers celebrated their freedom by eating\r\nthe \"red rice\" which is prepared on occasions of festivity. In another\r\nvillage, the _gunchō_ who spoke to me of these things said, there were\r\nseveral usurious landlords. \"The village headman got angry. He called\r\nthe landlords to him. He said to them that if they continued to lend\r\nat high interest the people would set fire to their houses and he\r\nwould not proceed against them. So the landlords became affrighted and\r\namended their lives.\" The rural people of Japan have always three\r\nweapons against usury, it was explained to me. First, there may be\r\ntried injuring the offending person's house--rural dwellings are\r\nmainly bamboo work and mud--by bumping into it with the heavy\r\npalanquin which is carried about the roadway at the time of the annual\r\nfestival. If such a hint should prove ineffective, recourse may be had\r\nto arson. Finally, there is the pistol. I remember someone's remark,\r\n\"A man does not lose a common mind and heart by becoming a landowner.\"\r\n\r\nI could not travel about the rural districts without there being\r\nbrought under my eyes the conditions which lead country girls to go to\r\nthe towns as _joro_ (prostitutes). A considerable agricultural\r\nauthority who had been all over Japan told me that he was in no doubt\r\nthat most of the girls adopted an immoral life through poverty. I\r\nspoke to this man, who had been abroad, of the disgrace to Japan\r\ninvolved in the presence of thousands of Japanese _joro_ at Singapore\r\nand so many other ports of the Asiatic mainland. Did these women go\r\nthere of their free will? My informant was of opinion that \"half are\r\ndeceived.\" I remember that on the Japanese steamship by which I went\r\nout to Japan there were several Japanese girls, degraded in aspect and\r\napparently in ill health, who were returning from Singapore. They were\r\nshepherded by an evil-looking fellow. The parting of these\r\nunfortunates from their girl friends as the vessel was about to start\r\nwas a piteous sight. An official who called on me in Aichi--I\r\nunderstood that he was the chief of the prefectural police--told me\r\nthat there were in the prefecture 2,011 girls in 222 houses, and that\r\nthere were in a year 725,598 customers, of whom 2,147 were foreigners.\r\nSums of from 200 to 500 yen might be paid to parents for a girl for a\r\nthree-years term. Food and clothes were also provided, but the girls\r\nwere almost invariably drawn into debt to the keepers, and not more\r\nthan 15 per cent. were able to return to their villages. All the girls\r\nin the houses had alleged poverty as the reason for their being\r\nthere.[47]\r\n\r\nBecause I was told that the moral condition of the town of\r\nAnjo--population 17,000--where the agricultural school of the\r\nprefecture is situated, had improved since its establishment, I asked\r\nfor some statistics. I found that there were 23 registered geisha, no\r\n_joro_, 50 teahouse girls with dubious characters and 55 sellers of\r\n_saké_. Against these figures were to be counted 19 Buddhist temples\r\nof four sects with 19 priests and 20 Shinto shrines with 4 priests.\r\n\r\nI met a schoolmaster who had prepared a history of his village in a\r\ndozen beautifully written volumes. He had been a vegetarian for\r\nfifteen years because, as a Buddhist, he believed that \"all living\r\nthings are in some degree my relatives.\" I picked up from him a\r\nvariant on \"the early bird catches the worm.\" It was, \"The early riser\r\nmay find a lost _rin_\" (tenth of a farthing). He gave me another\r\nproverb, \"The contents of a spitting pot, like riches, become fouler\r\nthe more they accumulate.\"\r\n\r\nI heard of temples which were promoting rural improvement by means of\r\nlanterns. In one village the lanterns were at the service of borrowers\r\nat three different places. The inscription on the lanterns says,\r\n\"Think of the mercy of Buddha who illuminates the darkness of your\r\nheart.\" There is written in smaller characters, \"If you live half a\r\n_ri_ away you need not return this lantern.\" Three hundred lanterns\r\nare lost or damaged in a year, but paper lanterns are cheap.\r\n\r\nOne temple has a society composed of those who have family graves in\r\nits grounds. These people \"study how to get the most abundant crop.\"\r\nThere is a prize for the best cultivated _tan_. Under this temple's\r\nauspices there is not only a co-operative credit and purchase\r\nassociation, a poultry society and an annual exhibition of\r\nagricultural products, but a school for nurses--they are \"taught to be\r\nnurses not only physically but morally.\" The boys and girls of the\r\nvillage are invited to the temple once a month and \"told a story.\" The\r\nyoungsters are asked to come to a \"learning meeting\" where they must\r\nrecite or exhibit something they have written or drawn; \"blockheads as\r\nwell as clever children are encouraged.\" A fund is being raised so\r\nthat \"a genius who may be suffering from poverty may be able to get\r\nproper education.\" Then there is a Women's Religious Association which\r\naims at \"the improvement, necessary from a religious point of view, in\r\nthe home and of agricultural business.\" Sermons are given to 500 women\r\nmonthly. The society sent comfort bags, containing letters,\r\ntooth-brushes and sweets, to soldiers at the taking of Tsingtao. A\r\nsimilar organisation for men had for thirteen years listened to a\r\nmonthly lecture by a well-known priest. It sends occasional\r\nsubscriptions outside the village. Finally, this praiseworthy temple\r\nissues every month 20,000 copies of a 4-1/2-sen magazine.\r\n\r\nThe Shinto shrines of the prefecture have in all a little more than 40\r\n_chō_ of land. Someone has hit on the plan of getting the\r\nagricultural societies of the county and villages to provide the\r\npriests with rice seed of superior varieties, the crop of which can be\r\nexchanged with farmers for common rice. This is done on a profitable\r\nbasis, because the shrines exchange unpolished rice for polished. A\r\n_gō_ of seed rice makes only about .5 _gō_ when husked.\r\n\r\nI walked along the road some little way with a Buddhist priest. In\r\nanswer to my enquiry he said that as a Buddhist he felt no difficulty\r\nabout the bag strung across his shoulders being of leather, for the\r\nfounder of his sect (Shinshu) ate meat. Even a strict Buddhist might\r\nnowadays eat animals not intentionally killed, animals which had not\r\nbeen seen alive and animals which were killed painlessly. But my\r\ncompanion abstained as much as possible from meat. As to the reason\r\nwhy some priests were inactive in the work of rural amelioration, he\r\nsupposed that their poverty, the tradition of devoting themselves to\r\nunworldly business and the fact that many of them were hereditary\r\npriests accounted for it. He dwelt on the things in common between\r\nShinshu and Christianity and said that, next to the teaching of the\r\nhead of the agricultural college in the prefecture, the preaching of a\r\nmissionary had led him to work for the good of his village.\r\n\r\nIn my host's house in the evening someone happened to quote the\r\nproverb, \"Richer after the fire.\" It means, of course, that after the\r\nfire the neighbours are so ready with help that the last state of the\r\nvictim of the fire is better than the first. The view was expressed\r\nthat hitherto charitable institutions of some Western patterns had not\r\nbeen so much needed in Japan as might be supposed.[48] \"Those who go\r\nto Europe from Japan are indeed much surprised by the number of\r\ninstitutions to help people.\" Here, however, is the story of an\r\ninstitution coming into existence in a village: \"There was a man who\r\nwas thought to be rich, but he lived like a miser. His _shoji_ were\r\nmade of waste paper and his guests received tea only. So he was\r\ndespised. But many years afterwards it was found that for a long time\r\nhe had been collecting books. Then, to the surprise of everybody, he\r\nbuilt a library for his village. He is not at all proud of this and\r\nthose who ridiculed him are now ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nI was invited to a \"Rural Life Exhibition.\" Some agricultural produce\r\nwas shown, but three hundred of the exhibits were manuscript books or\r\ndiagrams. One diagram illustrated the development in a particular\r\ncounty of the use of two bactericides, formalin and carbon bisulphide.\r\nThe formalin was in use to the value of 2,000 yen. Then there was a\r\nwall picture, a sort of Japanese \"The Child: What will he Become?\" The\r\ngood boy, aged fifteen, was shown spending his spare time in making\r\nstraw rope to the value of 3 sen 3 rin nightly, with the result that\r\nafter thirty years of such industry he became a rural capitalist who\r\npossessed 1,000 yen and lived in circumstances of dignity. In contrast\r\nwith this virtuous career there was shown the rural rake's progress. A\r\nyouth who was in the habit of laying out 3 sen 3 rin riotously in\r\nsweet-shops was proved to have wasted 1,000 yen in thirty years: the\r\nprodigal was justly exhibited fleeing from his home in debt.\r\n\r\nOne of the books on exhibition mentioned the volumes most in demand at\r\nsome village library. I translate the titles:\r\n\r\n        Physical and Intellectual Training\r\n        About being Ambitious\r\n        The Housewife of a Peasant Family\r\n        The Management of a Farm\r\n        The Days when Statesmen were Boys\r\n        Culture and Striving\r\n        Essence of Rural Improvement\r\n        A Hundred Beautiful Stories\r\n        The Art of Composition\r\n        The Preparation of the Conscript\r\n        A Medical Treatise\r\n        A Translation of \"Self-Help\"\r\n        Nature and Human Life\r\n        The Glories of Native Places\r\n        Anecdotes concerning Culture\r\n        Lives of Distinguished Peasants\r\n        Mulberry Planting\r\n        Chinese Romances\r\n        Glories of this Peaceful Reign\r\n        Ninomiya Sontoku\r\n\r\nI noticed among the exhibits a short autobiography of a farmer, an\r\nengaging egoist who wrote:\r\n\r\n\"As a young man my will was not in study and though I used my wits I\r\ndid many stupid things and the results were bad. Then I became a\r\nlittle awakened and for two years I studied at night with the primary\r\nschool teacher. After that I thought to myself in secret, 'Shall I\r\nbecome a wise man in this village, or, by diligently farming, a rich\r\nman?' That was my spiritual problem. Then all my family gathered\r\ntogether and consulted and decided[49] that it would suit the family\r\nbetter if I were to become a rich man, and I also agreed. To\r\naccomplish that aim I increased my area under cultivation and worked\r\nhard day and night. I cut down the cryptomeria at my homestead and\r\nplanted in their stead mulberries and persimmons. And I slowly changed\r\nmy dry land into rice fields (making it therefore more valuable). The\r\nsoil I got I heaped up at the homestead for eighteen years until I had\r\n28,000 cubic feet. I was able then to raise the level of my house\r\nwhich had become damp and covered with mould. The increase of my\r\ncultivated area and of the yield per _tan_ and the improvement of my\r\nhouse and the practice of economy were the delight of my life. I felt\r\ngrateful to my ancestors who gave me such a strong body. Sometimes I\r\nkept awake all night talking with my wife about the goodness of my\r\nancestors. Also when in bed I planned a compact homestead. I once read\r\na Japanese poem, 'What a joy to be born in this peaceful reign and to\r\nbe favoured by ploughs and horses.' (Most Japanese farming is done\r\nwithout either horses or ploughs.) It went deeply into my heart. Also\r\nI heard from the school teacher of four loves: love of State, love of\r\nEmperor, love of teacher and love of parent. I have been much favoured\r\nby those loves. I also heard the doctrines of Ninomiya: sincerity,\r\ndiligence, moderate living, unselfishness. I felt it a great joy to\r\nlive remembering those doctrines. I also went to the prefectural\r\nexperiment station and studied fruit growing and my spirit was much\r\nexpanded. I returned again to the station and the expert talked to me\r\nvery earnestly. I asked for a special variety of persimmon. The expert\r\nsent to Gifu prefecture for it. I planted the tree and made its top\r\ninto six grafts. It bore fruit and many passers-by envied it. Two\r\nyears after that I grafted five hundred trees and sold the grafted\r\nstock.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral villages sent to the exhibition statistics of great interest.\r\nOne village set forth the changes which had taken place in the social\r\nstatus of its inhabitants[50]. Some communities were represented by\r\nstatements of their hours of labour[51]. One small community's tables\r\nshowed how many of its inhabitants were \"diligent people,\" how many\r\n\"average workers\" and how many \"other people[52].\" A county\r\nagricultural association had painstakingly collected information not\r\nonly about the work done in a year[53] and the financial returns\r\nobtained by three typical farmers but about the way in which they\r\nspent what they earned.[54]\r\n\r\nOn my way back from the exhibition I heard the story of a priest. When\r\nfourteen years of age he obtained seeds of cryptomeria and planted\r\nthem in a spot in the hills. He also practised many economies. When\r\nstill in his teens he asked permission to take two shares in a 50-yen\r\nmoney-sharing club, but was not allowed to do so as no one would\r\nbelieve that he could complete his payments. He persisted, however,\r\nthat he would be able to pay what was required and he was at length\r\naccepted as a member. At twenty he became priest of a small temple\r\nwhich was in bad repair and had a debt of 125 yen. He brought with him\r\nhis 100 yen from the club and the young cryptomeria. He planted the\r\ntrees in the temple grounds. He said, \"I wish to rebuild the temple\r\nwhen these trees grow up.\" He cultivated the land adjoining his temple\r\nand contrived to employ several labourers. At last the cryptomeria\r\ngrew large enough for his purpose and he rebuilt the temple, expending\r\non the work not only his trees but 600 yen which he had by this time\r\nsaved. Then he proceeded to bring waste land into cultivation. At the\r\nage of sixty-two he gave his temple to another priest and went to live\r\nin a hut on the waste land. There came a tidal wave near the place, so\r\nhe went to the sufferers and invited five families to his now\r\ncultivated waste land. He gave them each a _tan_ of land and the\r\nmaterial for building cottages and showed them how to open more land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HIBACHI\" AND, IN \"TOKONOMA,\" FLOWER ARRANGEMENT AND\r\n\"KAKEMONO.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOL SHRINE CONTAINING EMPEROR'S PORTRAIT.]\r\n\r\nA good judge expressed the opinion that Buddhism was flourishing in 80\r\nper cent. of the villages of Aichi, but this was in a material and\r\nceremonial sense. The prefectures of Aichi and Niigata had been called\r\nthe \"kitchens of Hongwanji\"[55] (the great temple at Kyoto), such\r\nliberal contributions were forthcoming from them. \"A belief in\r\nprogress,\" this speaker said, \"may be a substitute for religion for\r\nmany of our people; another substitute is a belief in Japan.\" A\r\nvillage headman from the next prefecture (Shidzuoka) said: \"People in\r\nmy village do not omit to perform their Buddhist ceremonies, but they\r\nare not at their hearts religious. In our prefecture the influence of\r\nNinomiya is greater than that of Buddhism. If the villagers are good\r\nit is Ninomiyan principles that make them so. Under Ninomiyan\r\ninfluence the spirit of association has been aroused, thriftiness has\r\nbeen encouraged and extravagance reprimanded.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FENCING AT AN AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAR MEMENTOES AT THE SAME SCHOOL--ALL SCHOOLS HAVE SOME]\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Yamasaki one day that there was an old Scotswoman who\r\ndivided good people into \"rael Christians and guid moral fowk.\" What I\r\nwas curious to know was what proportion of Japanese rural people might\r\nbe fairly called \"real Buddhists\" and what proportion \"good moral\r\nfolk.\" \"There are certainly some real Buddhists, not merely good moral\r\nfolk,\" he assured me. \"If you penetrate deeply into the lives of the\r\npeople you will be able to find a great number of them. In ordinary\r\ndaily life, during a period when nothing extraordinary happens, it is\r\nnot easy to distinguish the two classes; but when any trouble comes\r\nthen those real religious people are undismayed, while the ordinarily\r\ngood moral people may sometimes go astray. The proportion of religious\r\npeople is rather large among the poor compared with the middle and\r\nupper classes. These poor people are always weighted with many\r\ntroubles which would be a calamity to persons of the middle or upper\r\nclasses. Such humble folk get support for their lives from what is in\r\ntheir hearts. Though they may suffer privation or loss they are glad\r\nthat they can live on by the mercy of Buddha. There are some religious\r\npeople even among those who are not poor. They are usually people who\r\nhave lost some of their riches suddenly, or a dear child, or have been\r\ndeprived of high position, or have met some kind of misfortune.\r\nSometimes a man may become religious because he feels deeply the\r\nmisfortunes or miseries of a neighbour or the miseries of war. Or his\r\nreligion may come by meditation. A man who begins to be religious is\r\nnot, however, at once noticed. On the contrary, if he is a true\r\nbeliever his daily life will be most ordinary.\"\r\n\r\nOne day I passed a primary school playground. The girls had just\r\nfinished and the boys were beginning Swedish drill. Everyone engaged\r\nin the drill, including the master, was barefoot.\r\n\r\nI saw that some of the cottages were built in an Essex fashion, of\r\npuddled clay and chopped straw faced with tarred boards. Some\r\ndwellings, however, were faced with straw instead of boards. They had\r\njust had their wall thatch renewed for the winter.\r\n\r\nIn one spot there was a quarter of a mile of wooden aqueduct for the\r\nservice of the paddy fields. Much agricultural pumping is done in\r\nAichi. I visited an irrigation installation where pumps (from London)\r\nwere turning barren hill tops into paddy fields.[56] The work was\r\nbeing done by a co-operative society of 550 members who had borrowed\r\nthe 40,000 yen they needed from a bank on an undertaking to repay in\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that common paddy near Anjo had been bought at 5,000 yen\r\nper _chō_ and not for building purposes. When one member of our\r\ncompany said, \"The farmers here are rivalling each other in hard\r\nwork,\" the weightiest authority among us replied: \"What the farmer\r\nmust do is to work not harder but better. At present he is not working\r\non scientific principles. The hours he is spending on really\r\nprofitable labour are not many. He must work more rationally. In 26\r\nvillages in the south-west of Japan, where farming calls for much\r\nlabour, it was found that the number of days' work in the year was\r\nonly 192. Statistics for Eastern Japan give 186 days.[57] As to a\r\nsecondary industry, one or two hours' work a night at straw rope\r\nmaking for a month may bring in a yen because the market for rope is\r\nconfined to Japan. The same with _zori_, a coarse sort being\r\npurchasable for 2 sen a pair. But supplementary work like silk-worm\r\nculture produces an article of luxury for which there is a world\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we returned home my host was kind enough to summarise for me--the\r\ngeneral reader may skip here--some of the reasons set forth by a\r\nprofessor of agricultural politics for the farmer's position being\r\nwhat it is:\r\n\r\n1. The average area cultivated per family is very small.\r\n\r\n2. The law of diminishing return.\r\n\r\n3. Imperfection of the agricultural system. Mainly crop raising, not a\r\ncombination of crop and stock raising, as in England. No profitable\r\nsecondary business but silkworm culture. Therefore the distribution of\r\nlabour throughout the year is not good and the number of days of\r\neffective labour is relatively small.\r\n\r\n4. The commercial side of agriculture has not been sufficiently\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n5. There has been a rise in the standard of living. In the old days\r\nthe farmer did not complain; he thought his lot could not be changed.\r\nHe was forbidden to adopt a new calling and he was restricted by law\r\nto a frugal way of living. Now farmers can be soldiers, merchants or\r\nofficials and can live as they please. They begin to compare their\r\nstandard of living with that of other callings. What were once not\r\nfelt to be miseries are now regarded as such.\r\n\r\n6. Formerly the farmer had not the expense of education and of losing\r\nthe services of his sons to the army. There is also an increase in\r\ntaxation. A representative family which incurred a public expenditure,\r\nnot including education, of 12.86 yen in 1890, paid in 1898 19.68 yen.\r\nIn 1908 it was faced by a claim for 34.28 yen.[58]\r\n\r\n7. Although the area of land does not increase in relation to the\r\nincrease of population, the size of the peasant family is increasing\r\nowing to the decrease of infanticide and abortion and the development\r\nof sanitation.\r\n\r\n8. The farmer suffers from debts at high interest.\r\n\r\n9. The character, morality and ability of the farmer are not yet fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n10. Formerly the farmer lived an economically self-contained\r\nexistence. He had no great need of money. He must now sell his produce\r\non a market with wider and wider fluctuations.\r\n\r\n11. There are many expensive customs and habits, for instance the two\r\nor three days' feasting at weddings and funerals.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening I was told this story. In a village in a far part\r\nof the prefecture there lived a farmer called Yosōgi. He was a thrifty\r\nand diligent man. When he became old he gave all that he had to his\r\nson. But the old man could not stop working. He would go to the farm\r\nand help his son. The son did not like this. He wanted his old father\r\nto rest. In the end he found that the only way to cope with his\r\nindustrious parent was to work very hard and leave him nothing to do.\r\nBut the old man was not to be balked. He took himself off to the\r\nhillside and began to make a paddy field where there had never been a\r\npaddy field before. To make a paddy field on such a slope is a\r\ndifficult task. The land must be embanked with stones and then\r\nlevelled. The building of the strong embankment alone calls for much\r\nlabour. The old man toiled very hard at his job and sometimes his son\r\nin despair sent his labourers to help him. At length the paddy field\r\nwas finished. But it was only a tenth of a _tan_ in area. When the son\r\nsaw the small result of so much labour he said to his father, \"I\r\ngrieve for the way you have toiled. You have laboured hard for many\r\ndays and my labourers have helped you, but all that has been\r\naccomplished is the making of a paddy field so small and distant that\r\nit is uneconomical.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the old man replied: \"When you go to Tokyo and see the\r\ngraveyard at Aoyama you will behold there many monuments of generals\r\nand ministers of State. Their merits and their works in this world are\r\ndescribed on those monuments. But do you know where the monument of\r\nthe famous hero Kusunoki Masashige is? It is near Kobe, and it is not\r\nmore than half as big as those monuments at Tokyo. Do you know where\r\nthe monument of the great Taiko is? It is in Kyoto, but it is only\r\nrecently that this monument was put up. Thus the monuments of our\r\ngreatest heroes are small or have been erected recently. The reason is\r\nthat it is unnecessary to raise big monuments for them because what\r\nthey did in their lives was in itself their monument. They built their\r\nmonument in the hearts of the people. Therefore we can never judge\r\nfrom the size of the monument the kind of work which was accomplished\r\nby the man who sleeps under it. Monuments are not only for ministers\r\nand warriors. We peasants can also erect monuments in our own way. To\r\nopen a new paddy field, to plant the bare hillside with trees, these\r\nare our monuments. How lonely it would be for me if there were no\r\nmonument left after my death. However small this paddy field may be,\r\nit will not be forgotten so long as it yields for your posterity the\r\nblessing of its rice crop.\" \"Happily,\" the interpreter added, \"the old\r\nman did not die so soon as he thought he would do. He lived for\r\nseveral years and planted the bare hillside with trees. Now the wood\r\nwhich grows there is worth 10,000 yen.\"\r\n\r\nA peasant proprietor expressed the conviction that goodness in a\r\nfamily was \"not the result of its own efforts but of the accumulation\r\nof ancestral effort.\" The \"ancestral merits and good spirit remain in\r\nthe family.\" On the problem of rich and poor he quoted the proverb,\r\n\"The very rich cannot remain very rich for more than three\r\ngenerations; a poor family cannot long remain poor.\" He said that he\r\nwould be interested to know what I found to be \"the causes of our\r\nvillagers becoming good or bad.\" \"For ourselves,\" he said, quoting\r\nanother proverb, \"'At the foot of the lighthouse it is dark.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST EXACTING CROP IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HARVEST FROM THE MUD\r\n\r\n_Toyo-ashiwara-no-chiiho-aki-mizuho-no-Kuni_ (Land of plenteous ears\r\nof rice in the plain of luxuriant reeds).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vast difference between Far Eastern and Western agriculture is\r\nmarked by the fact that, except by using such a phrase as shallow\r\npond--and this is inadequate, because a pond has a sloping bottom and\r\na rice field necessarily a level one--it is difficult to describe a\r\nrice field in terms intelligible to a Western farmer. The Japanese\r\nhave a special word for a rice field, _ta_, water field, written\r\n[Kanji: ta]. It will be noticed that the ideograph looks like a water\r\nfield in four compartments. Another word, _hata_ or _hatake_,[59]\r\nwritten [Kanji: hata], tells the story of the dry or upland field. It\r\nis the ideograph for water field in association with the ideograph for\r\nfire, and, as we shall see later on, when we make acquaintance with\r\n\"fire farming,\" an upland field is a tract the vegetation of which was\r\noriginally burnt off.\r\n\r\nMany of us have seen rice growing in Italy or in the United States.\r\nBut in Japan[60] the paddies are very-much smaller than anything to be\r\nseen in the Po Valley and in Texas. Owing to the plentiful water\r\nsupply of a mountainous land, cultivation proceeds with some degree of\r\nregularity and with a certain independence of the rainy season; and\r\nthere has been applied to traditional rice farming not a few\r\nscientific improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of rice with a low yield called upland rice which,\r\nlike corn, is grown in fields. But the first requisite of general rice\r\nculture is water. The ordinary rice crop can be produced only on a\r\npiece of ground on which a certain depth of water is maintained.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain this depth of water, three things must be done.\r\nThe plot of ground must be made level, low banks of earth must be\r\nbuilt round it in order to keep in the water, and a system of\r\nirrigation must be arranged to make good the loss of water by\r\nevaporation, by leakage and by the continual passing on of some of the\r\nwater to other plots belonging to the same owner or to other farmers.\r\nThe common name of a rice plot is paddy, and the rice with its husk\r\non, that is, as it is knocked from the ear by threshing, is called\r\npaddy rice. The rice exported from Japan is some of it husked and some\r\nof it polished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A 200-YEARS-OLD JAPANESE DRAWING OF THE RICE PLANT]\r\n\r\nSome 90 per cent. of the rice grown in Japan is ordinary rice. The\r\nremaining 10 per cent. is about 2 per cent. upland and 8 per cent,\r\nglutinous[61]--the sort used for making the favourite _mochi_ (rice\r\nflour dumplings, which few foreigners are able to digest). It would be\r\npossible to collect in Japan specimens of rice under 4,000 different\r\nnames, but, like our potato names, many of these represent duplicate\r\nvarieties. Rice, again reminding us of potatoes, is grown in early,\r\nmiddle and late season sorts.[62]\r\n\r\nJust one-half of the cultivated area of Japan is devoted to paddy,\r\nbut there is to be added to this area under rice more than a quarter\r\nmillion acres producing the upland rice, the yield of which is lower\r\nthan that of paddy rice. The paddy and upland rice areas together make\r\nup more than a half of the cultivated land. The paddies which are not\r\nin situations favourable to the production of second crops of rice\r\n(they are grown in one prefecture only) are used, if the water can be\r\ndrawn off, for growing barley or wheat or green manure as a second\r\ncrop[63].\r\n\r\nIt is not only the Eastern predilection for rice and the wet condition\r\nof the country, but the heavy cropping power of the plant[64]--500\r\n_go_ per _tan_ above barley and wheat yields--that makes the Japanese\r\nfarmer labour so hard to grow it[65]. Intensively cultivated though\r\nJapan is, the percentage of cultivated land to the total area of the\r\ncountry is, however, little more than half that in Great Britain[66].\r\nThis is because Japan is largely mountains and hills. Level land for\r\nrice paddies can be economically obtained in many parts of such a\r\ncountry by working it in small patches only. There is no minimum size\r\nfor a Japanese paddy. I have seen paddies of the area of a counterpane\r\nand even of the size of a couple of dinner napkins.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not only to make the paddy in a spot where it can be\r\nsupplied with water, but to make it in such a way that it will hold\r\nall the water it needs. It must be level, or some of the rice plants\r\nwill have only their feet wet while others will be up to their necks.\r\nThe ordinary procedure in making a paddy is to remove the top soil,\r\nbeat down the subsoil beneath, and then restore the top soil--there\r\nmay be from 5 to 10 in. of it. But the best efforts of the\r\npaddy-field builder may be brought to naught by springs or by a\r\ngravelly bottom. Then the farmer must make the best terms he can with\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nPaddies, as may be imagined from their physical limitations, are of\r\nevery conceivable shape. There is assuredly no way of altering the\r\nshape of the paddies which are dexterously fitted into the hillsides.\r\nBut large numbers of paddies are on fairly level ground.[67] There is\r\nno real need for these being of all sizes and patterns. They are what\r\nthey are because of the degree to which their construction was\r\nconditioned by water-supply problems, the financial resources of those\r\nwho dug them or the position of neighbours' land. And no doubt in the\r\ncourse of centuries there has been a great deal of swapping, buying\r\nand inheriting. So the average farmer's paddies are not only of all\r\nshapes and sizes but here, there and everywhere.\r\n\r\nTherefore there arose wise men to point out that for a farmer to work\r\na number of oddly shaped bits of land scattered all about the village\r\nwas uneconomical and out of date. (Like the old English strip system\r\nwhich still survives in the Isle of Axholme.) So what was called an\r\nadjustment of paddy fields was carried out in many places. The farmers\r\nwere persuaded to throw their varied assortment of fields into\r\nhotchpot and then to have the mass cut up into oblong fields of equal\r\nor relative sizes. These were then shared out according to what each\r\nman had contributed. In some cases a little compensation had to be\r\ngiven, for there were differences in the qualities as well as the\r\nareas of the holdings. But reasonable justice was eventually done all\r\nround, and ever afterwards a farmer, now that his holding was in\r\nadjoining tracts, might spend his time working in his paddies instead\r\nof in walking to and from them. Because many unnecessary paths and\r\ndivisions between paddies were done away with there was brought about\r\na saving of labour and increased efficiency of cultivation. There was\r\nalso a little more land to cultivate and the paddies were big enough\r\nfor an ox or a pony to be employed in them, and the water supply was\r\nbetter and sufficiently under control for floods to be averted.[68] In\r\nbrief, costs were lower and crops were better.[69]\r\n\r\nThus all over Japan nowadays one sees considerable tracts of adjusted\r\npaddy fields. They are a joy to the rural sociologist. In its way\r\nthere has been nothing like it agriculturally in our time. For each of\r\nthese little farmers valued his odds and ends of paddy above their\r\nagricultural worth. He or his forbears had made them or bought them or\r\nmarried into them. And he believed that his own paddies were in a\r\ncondition of fertility surpassing not a few, and he doubted greatly\r\nwhether after adjustment he would find himself in possession of as\r\nvaluable land as his own. Sometimes also he believed that his paddies\r\nwere especially fortunate geomantically.[70] Yet, convinced by the\r\narguments for adjustment, the peasant agreed to the proposed\r\nrearrangement, let his old tracts go and accepted in exchange neat\r\noblongs out of the common stock. Sometimes so great was the change\r\nbrought about in a village by adjustment that more than the paddies\r\nwere dealt with. Cottages were taken to new sites and the bones in\r\nmany little grave plots were removed. In a village in which there had\r\nbeen an exhumation of the bones of 2,700 persons and a transference of\r\ntombstones, I was told that the assembling together of the remains of\r\nthe departed in one place \"had had a unifying effect on the\r\ncommunity.\" In this village within a period of twelve years 96 per\r\ncent. of the paddies had been adjusted.[71]\r\n\r\nAn advantage of adjustment which has not yet been mentioned is that\r\nadjusted paddies can usually be dried off at harvest and can therefore\r\nbe put under a second crop, usually of grain. More than a third of the\r\npaddy-field area of the country can be dried off, and therefore\r\nproduces a second crop of barley or wheat. The farmer has two\r\nadvantages if, owing to adjustment or natural advantages, he is able\r\nto dry off his land. Of the first or rice crop, if he is a tenant\r\nfarmer, he has had to pay his landlord perhaps 60 per cent, in rent,\r\nless straw;[72] but the second crop is his own. The further advantage\r\nis that second-crop land can be cultivated dry shod. One-crop paddy is\r\nunder water all the year round, and must be cultivated with wet feet\r\nand legs.\r\n\r\nIt is because more than half the paddies are always under water that\r\nrice cultivation is so laborious. Think of the Western farm labourer\r\nbeing asked to plough and the allotment holder to dig almost knee-deep\r\nin mud. Although much paddy is ploughed with the aid of an ox, a cow\r\nor a pony,[73] most rice is the product of mattock or spade labour.\r\nThere is no question about the severity of the labour of paddy\r\ncultivation. For a good crop it is necessary that the soil shall be\r\nstirred deeply.\r\n\r\nFollowing the turning over of the stubble under water, comes the clod\r\nsmashing and harrowing by quadrupedal or bipedal labour. It is not\r\nonly a matter of staggering about and doing heavy work in sludge. The\r\nsludge is not clean dirt and water but dirty dirt and water, for it\r\nhas been heavily dosed with manure, and the farmer is not fastidious\r\nas to the source from which he obtains it.[74] And the sludge\r\nordinarily contains leeches. Therefore the cultivator must work\r\nuncomfortably in sodden clinging cotton feet and leg coverings. Long\r\ncustom and necessity have no doubt developed a certain indifference to\r\nthe physical discomfort of rice cultivation. The best rice will grow\r\nonly in mud and, except on the large uniform paddies of the adjusted\r\nareas, there is small opportunity for using mechanical methods.\r\n\r\nOne day when I went into the country it happened to be raining hard,\r\nbut the men and women toiled in the paddies. They were breaking up the\r\nflooded clods with a tool resembling the \"pulling fork\" used in the\r\nWest for getting manure from a dung cart. On other farms the task of\r\nworking the quagmire was being done by two persons with the aid of a\r\ndisconsolate pony harnessed to a rude harrow. The men and women in the\r\npaddies kept off the rain by means of the usual wide straw hats and\r\nloose straw mantles, admirable in their way in their combination of\r\nlightness and rainproofness. Often, besides the farmer's wife, a young\r\nwidow or a young unmarried woman may be seen at work, but, as was once\r\nexplained to me, \"The old Miss is not frequent in Japan.\"[75]\r\n\r\nPlanting time arrives in the middle of June or thereabouts, when the\r\npaddy has been brought by successive harrowings into a fine tilth or\r\nrather sludge. It is illustrative of the exacting ways of rice that\r\nnot only has it to have a growing place specially fashioned for it, it\r\ncannot be sown as cereals are sown. It must be sown in beds and then\r\nbe transplanted. The seed beds have been sown in the latter part of\r\nApril or the early part of May, according to the variety of rice and\r\nthe locality.[76] The seeds have usually been selected by immersion in\r\nsalt water and have been afterwards soaked in order to advance\r\ngermination. There is a little soaking pond on every farm. By the use\r\nof this pond the period in which the seeds are exposed to the\r\ndepredations of insects, etc., is diminished. The seed bed itself is\r\nabout the width of an onion bed, in order that weeds and insect pests\r\nmay be easily reached. The seed bed is, of course, under water. The\r\nseed is dropped into the water and sinks into the mud. Within about\r\nthirty or forty days the seedlings are ready for transplanting. They\r\nhave been the object of unremitting care. Weeds have been plucked out\r\nand insects have been caught by nets or trapped. There is a\r\ncontrivance which, by means of a wheel at either end, straddles the\r\nseed bed, and is drawn slowly from one end to the other. It catches\r\nthe insects as they hop or fly up.\r\n\r\nIn many localities specially fine varieties are grown for seed on the\r\nland of the Shinto shrines. In other localities special sorts are\r\nraised in ordinary paddies but surrounded by the rope and white paper\r\nstreamers which represent a consecrated place. In not a few villages\r\nthere are communal seed beds so that many farmers may grow the same\r\nvariety, and there may be a considerable bulk for co-operative sale.\r\n\r\nAt transplanting time every member of the family capable of helping\r\nrenders assistance. Friends also give their aid if it is not planting\r\ntime for them too. The work is so engrossing that young children who\r\nare not at school are often left to their own devices. Sometimes they\r\nplay by the ditch round the paddies and are drowned. Five such cases\r\nof drowning are reported from three prefectures on the day I write\r\nthis. The suggestion is made that in the rice districts there should\r\nbe common nurseries for farmers' children at planting time.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the planters, working in a row across the paddy, set\r\nout the seedlings in the mud below the water, is remarkable.[77] The\r\nfirst weeding or raking takes place about a fortnight after planting.\r\nAfter that there are three more weedings, the last being about the end\r\nof August. All kinds of hoes are used in the sludge. They are usually\r\nprovided with a wooden or tin float. But most of the weeding is done\r\nsimply by thrusting the hand into the mud, pulling out the weed and\r\nthrusting it back into the sludge to rot. The back-breaking character\r\nof this work may be imagined. As much of it is done in the hottest\r\ntime of the year the workers protect themselves by wide-brimmed hats\r\nof the willow-plate pattern and by flapping straw cloaks or by bundles\r\nof straw fastened on their backs.\r\n\r\nA sharp look-out must be kept for insects of various sorts. In more\r\nthan one place I saw the boys and girls of elementary schools wading\r\nin the paddies and stroking the young rice with switches in order to\r\nmake noxious insects rise. The creatures were captured by the young\r\nenthusiasts with nets. The children were given special times off from\r\nschool work in which to hunt the rice pests and were encouraged to\r\nbring specimens to school.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater delight to the eye than the paddies in their early\r\ngreen, rippled and gently laid over by the wind. (One should say\r\ngreens, for there is every tint from the rather woe-begone yellowish\r\ngreen of the newly planted out rice to the happy luxuriant dark green\r\nof the paddies that have long been enjoying the best of quarters.) As\r\nharvest time approaches,[78] the paddies, because they are not all\r\nplanted with the same variety of rice, are in patches of different\r\nshades. Some are straw colour, some are reddish brown or almost black.\r\nA poet speaks of the \"hanging ears of rice.\" Rice always seems to hang\r\nits head more than other crops. It is weaker in the straw than barley,\r\nbut rice frequently droops not only because of its natural habit, but\r\nbecause it has been over-manured or wrongly manured or because of wind\r\nor wet.\r\n\r\nBeyond wind,[79] insects and drought, floods are the enemies of rice.\r\nWhen the plants are young, three or four days' flooding do not matter\r\nmuch, but in August, when the ears are shooting, it is a different\r\nmatter. The sun pours down and soon rots the rice lying in the warm\r\nwater. Sometimes the farmer, by almost withdrawing the water from his\r\npaddies, raises the temperature of the soil with benefit to the crop.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is fortunate who is able to get the water completely out of\r\nhis paddies by the time harvest arrives, but, as we have seen,\r\ntwo-thirds of the paddies must be harvested in sludge. Many crops are\r\nmuddied before they can be cut. Sometimes on the eve of harvest the\r\nfarmer wades in and tries, by arranging the fallen stems across one\r\nanother, to keep some of the ears out of the water. But he is not very\r\nsuccessful. Rice may lie in the wet a week or even the best end of a\r\nfortnight without serious damage. But all that this means is that\r\nwithin the period specified it may not sprout. It must be damaged to\r\nsome extent even by a few days' immersion. The reason why it is not\r\ndamaged more than it is is no doubt, first, because rice is a plant\r\nwhich has been brought up to take its chances with water, and in the\r\nsecond place because the thing which is known to the housewife as rice\r\nis not really the grain at all but the interior of the grain.\r\n\r\nWestern farmers are hard put to it when their grain crops are beaten\r\ndown by wind and rain; Japanese agriculturists, because they gather\r\ntheir harvest with a short sickle, do not find a laid crop difficult\r\nto cut. But these harvesters are very muddy indeed. When the rice is\r\ncut and the sheaves are laid along the low mud wall of the paddy they\r\nare still partly in the sludge. We know how miserable a wet harvest is\r\nat home, but think of the slushy harvest with which most Japanese\r\nfarmers struggle every year of their lives. The rice grower, although\r\nyear in and year out he has the advantage of a great deal of sunshine,\r\nseldom gets his crop in without some rain. How does he manage to dry\r\nhis October and November rice? By means of a temporary fence or rack\r\nwhich he rigs up in his paddy field or along a path or by the\r\nroadside. On this structure the sheaves are painstakingly suspended\r\nears down. Sometimes he utilises poles suspended between trees. These\r\ntrees, grown on the low banks of the paddies, have their trunks\r\ntrimmed so that they resemble parasols.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheaves are removed in order to be threshed on the upland\r\npart of the holding, they are carried away at either end of a pole on\r\na man's shoulder or are piled up on the back of an ox, cow or pony.\r\nThe height of the pile under which some animals stagger up from the\r\npaddies gives one a vivid conception of \"the last straw.\"\r\n\r\nThreshing is usually done by a man, woman, girl or youth taking as\r\nmany stems as can be easily grasped in both hands and drawing the\r\nears, first one way and then another, through a horizontal row of\r\nsteel teeth. The flail is not used for threshing rice but is employed\r\nfor barley. Another common way of knocking out grain is by beating the\r\nstraw over a table or a barrel. There are all sorts of cheap\r\nhand-worked threshing machines. After the threshing of the rice comes\r\nthe winnowing, which may be done by the aid of a machine but is more\r\nlikely to be effected in the immemorial way, by one person pouring the\r\nroughly threshed ears from a basket or skep while another worker\r\nvigorously fans the grain. The result is what is known as paddy rice.\r\nThe process which follows winnowing is husking. This is done in the\r\nsimplest possible form of hand mill. Before husking the rice grain is\r\nin appearance not unlike barley and it is no easy matter to get its\r\nhusk off. The husking mill is often made of hardened clay with many\r\nwooden teeth on the rubbing surface. After husking there is another\r\nwinnowing. Then the grains are run through a special apparatus of\r\nrecent introduction called _mangoku doshi_, so that faulty ones may be\r\npicked out. The result is unpolished rice.\r\n\r\nIt looks grey and unattractive, and unfortunately the unprepossessing\r\nbut valuable outer coat is polished away. This is done in a mortar\r\nhollowed out of a section of a tree trunk or out of a large stone. One\r\nmay see a young man or a young woman pounding the rice in the mortar\r\nwith a heavy wooden beetle or mallet. Often the beetle is fastened to\r\na beam and worked by foot. Or the polishing apparatus may be driven by\r\nwater, oil or steam power. Constantly in the country there are seen\r\nlittle sheds in each of which a small polishing mill driven by a water\r\nwheel is working away by itself. After the polishing, the _mangoku\r\ndoshi_ is used again to free the rice from the bran. This polished\r\nrice is still further polished by the dealer, who has more perfect\r\nmills than the farmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCATTERING ARTIFICIAL MANURE IN ADJUSTED PADDIES.]\r\n\r\nThe farmer pays his rent not in the polished but in the husked rice.\r\nAt the house of a former _daimyo_ I saw an instrument which the\r\nfeudal lord's bailiff was accustomed to thrust into the rice the\r\ntenants tendered. If when the instrument was withdrawn more than three\r\nhusks were found adhering, the rice was returned to be recleaned.\r\nThere are names for all the different kinds of rice. For instance,\r\npaddy rice is _momi_; husked rice is _gemmai_; half-polished rice is\r\n_hantsukimai_; polished rice is _hakumai_; cooked rice is _gohan_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANTING OUT RICE SEEDLINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUSH-CART FOR COLLECTION OF FERTILISER (TOKYO).]\r\n\r\nA century ago the farmer ate his rice at the _gemmai_ stage, that is\r\nin its natural state, and there was no _beri-beri_. The \"black saké\"\r\nmade from this _gemmai_ rice is still used in Shinto ceremonies. In\r\norder to produce clear _saké_ the rice was polished. Then well-to-do\r\npeople out of daintiness had their table rice polished. Now polished\r\nrice is the common food. Half-polished rice may be prepared with two\r\nor three hundred blows of the mallet; fully polished or white rice may\r\nreceive six, seven or eight hundred, or even it may be a thousand\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] See Appendix VII.\r\n\r\n[48] See Appendix VIII.\r\n\r\n[49] Family in the French sense.\r\n\r\n[50] See Appendix IX.\r\n\r\n[51] See Appendix X.\r\n\r\n[52] See Appendix XI.\r\n\r\n[53] See Appendix XII.\r\n\r\n[54] See Appendix XIII.\r\n\r\n[55] It was recently stated that the consent of the authorities was\r\nawaited for collections to the amount of 20 million yen, of which\r\n13-1/2 million were for the two Hongwanjis.\r\n\r\n[56] For yields of new paddy, see Appendix XIV.\r\n\r\n[57] See Appendix XII.\r\n\r\n[58] It would be from 80 to 100 yen now.\r\n\r\n[59] _Hata_ (upland field) is not to be confounded with _hara_\r\n(prairie, wilderness, moor, often erroneously translated, plain).\r\n\r\n[60] Rice is grown in every prefecture. The largest total yields are\r\nin Niigata, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Yamagata, Ibariki and Chiba.\r\n\r\n[61] See Appendix XV.\r\n\r\n[62] The average yield of the three kinds at Government experimental\r\nfarms--the middle variety yields best and next comes the late\r\nvariety--is about 2-1/2 _koku_ per _tan_ or roughly (a _koku_ being\r\nabout 5 bushels and a _tan_ about a quarter of an acre) about 45\r\nbushels per acre. The average yield of ordinary rice in Japan in an\r\nordinary year is 40-3/4 bushels. In the bumper year of 1920 the\r\naverage yield was 41-1/3 bushels. In the year 1916 (to which most of\r\nthe figures in this book, apart from the Appendix and footnotes, in\r\nwhich the latest available figures are given, refer) there was\r\nproduced 58-1/4 million _koku_ of all kinds of rice, the value of\r\nwhich was 826-1/2 million yen. The normal yield (average of 7 years,\r\nexcluding the years of highest and lowest production) is 54-1/2\r\nmillion _koku_. See Appendix XV.\r\n\r\n[63] For wheat and barley crops, see Appendix XVI.\r\n\r\n[64] A few rice plants may be seen growing at Kew.\r\n\r\n[65] The cost of the rice crop and the income it yields are discussed\r\nin Appendix XVII.\r\n\r\n[66] See Appendix XVIII.\r\n\r\n[67] In Japanese rural statistics the word plain may be said to mean a\r\ntract of land which is neither cultivated nor timbered nor used for\r\nthe purposes of habitation. Sometimes it is called prairie, but this\r\nis not always correct as it is very often a barren waste, a tract of\r\nvolcanic ash, or an area producing bamboo grass. Some of this land,\r\nhowever, could be cultivated after proper irrigation, etc. In this\r\nnote, plains is employed in the ordinary acceptation of the word. Of\r\nsuch plains there are several. The plain in which Tokyo is situated is\r\n82,000 acres in extent. The traveller from Kobe to Tokyo passes\r\nthrough the Kinai plain in which Kobe, Kyoto and Osaka stand. It is\r\nsaid to feed 2-1/2 million people. Four other plains are reputed to\r\nfeed 7-1/2 million.\r\n\r\n[68] Rivers supply about 65 per cent. of the paddy water and\r\nreservoirs about 21 per cent. The remainder has to be got from other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n[69] An acreage of a _tan_ is aimed at, but it is frequently larger;\r\nit may even be 4 _tan_ (an acre). The cost ranges from about 8 yen to\r\n50 yen per _tan_. The average increase in yield alter adjustment is\r\nabout 15 per cent., to which must be added the yield of the new land\r\nobtained, say 3 per cent. of the area adjusted. The consent of half\r\nthe owners is required for adjustment.\r\n\r\n[70] Once when a friend in Tokyo had trouble with her servants a maid\r\ninformed her that the house was unlucky because a certain necessary\r\napartment faced the wrong point of the compass.\r\n\r\n[71] In the whole of Japan by 1919 two million and a half acres had\r\nbeen adjusted or were in course of adjustment.\r\n\r\n[72] The rent is usually 57 per cent. of the rice harvest in the\r\npaddies and 44 per cent. (in cash or kind) of the crops on the\r\nnon-paddy land. Any crop raised in the paddies between the harvesting\r\nof one rice crop and the planting out of the next belongs to the\r\nfarmer. (All taxes and rates are paid by the landlord, and amount to\r\nfrom 30 to 33 per cent. of the rent.) The area under paddy and the\r\narea of upland under cultivation are almost equal.\r\n\r\n[73] See Appendix XIX.\r\n\r\n[74] See Appendix XX.\r\n\r\n[75] In 1920 there were 38,922,437 males and 38,083,073 females.\r\n\r\n[76] See Appendix XXI.\r\n\r\n[77] See Appendix XXII.\r\n\r\n[78] The harvest extends from mid-September in the north of Japan to\r\nthe end of October or beginning of November in the south. The harvest\r\nis taken early in the north for fear of frost.\r\n\r\n[79] The \"210th day\" (counted from the beginning of spring), when\r\nflowering commences, is so critical a period that the weather\r\nconditions during the twenty-four hours in every prefecture are\r\nreported to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE RICE BOWL, THE GODS AND THE NATION\r\n\r\nI thank whatever gods there be....--HENLEY\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many people who have not been in the East or in the rice trade\r\nrealise that rice, in the course of the polishing it receives from the\r\nfarmer and the dealer, loses nearly half its bulk? A necessary part of\r\nthe grain is lost. No wonder that sensible people in Japan and the\r\nWest demand the grey unpolished rice. In Japan some enterprising\r\nperson has started selling bottled stuff made from the part of the\r\nrice grain that is rubbed off in the polishing process. It does not\r\nlook appetising. An easier thing would be to leave some of the coating\r\non the rice. One thinks of what Smollett said of white bread:\r\n\r\n\"They prefer it to wholesome bread because it is whiter. Thus they\r\nsacrifice their health to a most absurd gratification of a misjudging\r\neye, and the tradesman is obliged to poison them in order to live.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough, for economy's sake, a considerable amount of barley is eaten\r\nwith or instead of rice, it may be said in a general way that the\r\nJapanese people, like so many millions of other Asiatics, have rice\r\nfor breakfast, rice for lunch and rice for dinner. If they have\r\nanything to eat between meals it is as like as not to be rice cakes---\r\nto the foreigner's taste a loathly, half-cooked compost of rice flour\r\nor pounded rice and water, a sort of tepid underdone muffin. We in the\r\nWest have bread at every meal as the Japanese have rice, but we eat\r\nour bread not only as plain bread but as toast and bread-and-butter;\r\nwe also ring the changes on brown, white and oat bread.\r\n\r\nAmong the covered lacquer dishes on the little table set before each\r\nkneeling breakfaster, luncher or diner in Japan there is one which is\r\nempty. This is the rice bowl. When the meal begins--or in the case of\r\nan elaborate dinner at the rice course--the maid brings in a large\r\ncovered wooden copper-bound or brass-bound tub or round lacquered box\r\nof hot rice. This rice she serves with a big wooden spoon, the only\r\nspoon ever seen at a Japanese meal. A man may have three helpings or\r\nfour in a bowl about as big as a large breakfast cup. The etiquette is\r\nthat, though other dishes may be pecked at, the rice in one's bowl\r\nmust be finished. The usage on this point may have originated in the\r\nfeeling that it was almost impious to waste the staple food of the\r\ncountry. It is not difficult to pick up the last rice grains with the\r\nwooden _hashi_ (chopsticks), for the rice is skilfully boiled. (Soft\r\nrice is served to invalids only.) But when the bowl is almost empty\r\nthe custom is to pour into it weak tea or hot water, and then to drink\r\nthis, so getting rid of the odd grains. It is through omitting to\r\ndrink in this way that foreigners get indigestion when at a Japanese\r\nmeal they eat a lot of rice.\r\n\r\nAt first it is not easy for the foreigner to believe that people can\r\ncome with appetite to several bowls of plain rice three times a\r\nday.[80] But good rice does seem to have something of the property of\r\noatmeal, the property of a continual tastiness. Further, the rice\r\neater picks up now and then from a small saucer a piece of pickle\r\nwhich may have either a salty or a sweet fermented taste. The\r\nnutrition gained at a Japanese meal is largely in soups in which the\r\nbean preparations, _tofu_ and _miso_, and occasionally eggs, are used.\r\nAnd there is no country in the world where more fish is eaten than in\r\nJapan. The coast waters and rivers team with fish, and fish--fresh,\r\ndried and salted, shell-fish and fish unrecognisable as fish after all\r\nsorts of ingenious treatment--is consumed by almost everybody.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are in no doubt that the foreign rice which is brought\r\ninto the country to supplement the home supply is inferior to their\r\nown.[81] Inferior means that they prefer the flavour of their own\r\nrice, just as most Scots prefer oatmeal made from oats grown in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the year of the Coronation--it took place three years after the\r\nEmperor's accession--two prefectures had the honour of being chosen to\r\nproduce the rice to be placed before gods, Emperor and dignitaries at\r\nKyoto. The work was not undertaken without ceremony. I was a witness\r\nof the rites performed at the planting of the rice in one of the\r\nprefectures. Plots had been prepared with enormous care. Along the top\r\nof the special fencing were the Shinto straw bands and paper\r\nstreamers. A small shrine had been built to overlook the plots. Even\r\nthe instruments of the little meteorological station near, by which\r\nthe management of the crop would be guided, were surrounded by straw\r\nbands and streamers--religion protecting science. The mattocks and\r\nother implements which had been used in the preparation of the paddy\r\nor were to be used in getting in the crops and in cultivating,\r\nharvesting, threshing and cleaning it were all new. Even the herring\r\nwhich had manured the plot had been \"specially selected and blessed.\"\r\nFurther, there was a special bath-house where the young men and women\r\nwho were to plant the rice had washed ceremonially at an early hour.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the spot through a crowd of twenty or thirty thousand\r\npeople who were gathering to witness the ceremony. A covered platform\r\nhad been built in front of the rice field shrine, and on either side\r\nwere large roofed-in spaces for some scores of Shinto priests and the\r\nfavoured spectators. The ceremony lasted two hours. It carried us\r\nmagically away from a Japan of frock coats to Japan of a thousand, it\r\nmay be two thousand years ago. Between the wail of ancient wood and\r\nwind instruments and the cinema operators who missed nothing external\r\nand some bored top-hatted spectators who furtively puffed a cigarette\r\nbefore the ceremony came to an end,[82] what a gulf! Platter after\r\nplatter of food, sometimes rice, sometimes vegetables, sometimes\r\nfruit, sometimes a big fish, was passed by one priest to another in\r\nthe sunlight until all the offerings were reverently placed by a\r\nspecial dignitary on one of those unpainted, unvarnished, undecorated\r\nbut exquisitely proportioned altars which are an artistic glory of\r\nShintoism. The shrine was wholly open on the side of the rice field,\r\nand the high priest was in full view as he stood before the altar with\r\nbowed head and folded hands, his robe caught by the breeze, and\r\ndelivered in a loud voice his zealous invocation. His words were\r\nstressed not only by an acolyte who twanged the strings of a venerable\r\nharp, but by the song of a lark which rose with the first strains of\r\nthe harpist. The purpose of the ceremony was to call down the gods and\r\nto gain their blessing for the crop and the new reign. At the moment\r\nof highest solemnity the thousands assembled bowed their heads: the\r\ngods were deigning to descend and accept the offering. More ancient\r\nmusic, more ceremonial, and the gods having been called upon to return\r\nto high heaven, the laden platters were gravely removed, and the rice\r\nplanting in the adjoining field began. To the sound of drum the young\r\nmen and women in special costumes strode through the wicket into the\r\nmud of the paddies, and, under the supervision of the director of the\r\nprefectural agricultural experiment station in a silk hat, planted out\r\nthe tufts of rice seedlings in scrupulously measured rows.\r\n\r\nI asked a distinguished Japanese who was standing near me--he is a\r\nChristian--how many of the educated people in the assembly believed\r\nthat the gods had descended. His answer was, \"I may not believe that\r\nthe gods of a truth descended, but I find something beautiful in\r\ncalling on the gods with a harp of Old Japan, and I do believe that\r\nour humble and natural offering to-day may be acceptable to whatever\r\ngods there may be and that it is a worthy exercise for us to undertake\r\nand may also be conducive to a good harvest.\" My friend attempted the\r\nfollowing rough rendering of a song which had been sung by the rice\r\nplanters before the shrine:\r\n\r\nThis day the beginning of sowing at an auspicious time--\r\nLong life to the rice!\r\nMay it be a token of the years of the Reign,\r\nThe seed of peace for the world--\r\nMay it start from this consecrated field!\r\nOne in heart we see to it that our seedlings are well matched.\r\nMikawa's[83] millennium and the millennium of rice.\r\nLet us pray for an abundant shooting.\r\nNow let us plant the seedlings straight;\r\nPleasing to the gods are the ways that are not crooked.\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremony, in which the staple crop of the country and the\r\nlabour of the farmer in his paddy field had been honoured by the State\r\nand dignified by ancestral blessings, there was luncheon in one of\r\nthose deftly contrived reed-covered structures, of the building of\r\nwhich the Japanese have the knack, and the Governor asked some of us\r\nto say a few words. Then on a raised platform in the open there was\r\nenacted a comic interlude such as might have been seen in England in\r\nthe Middle Ages. In the evening I was bidden to a dinner of the\r\nofficials responsible for the day's doings. The Governor made a kindly\r\nreference to my labours and the local M.P. presented me with a kimono\r\nlength of the cotton material which had been woven for the planters of\r\nthe sacred rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII[84]\r\n\r\nThe production of rice has increased more quickly than the growth of\r\nthe population. If we consider, along with the advance in population,\r\nthe crops of the years 1882 and 1913, which were held to be average,\r\nand, in order to be as up-to-date as possible, the normal annual\r\nyield[85] of the five-years period 1912-18, we find that, as between\r\n1882 and 1913, the population increased 45 per cent. and rice\r\nproduction increased 63 per cent., while as between 1882 and the\r\nnormal annual yield period of 1912-18, the population increased 55 per\r\ncent, and the crop 75 per cent.[86]\r\n\r\nThis is a noteworthy fact. But equally noteworthy is the fact that in\r\nthe 1882-1913 period, in which the production of rice increased 63 per\r\ncent. and the population only 45 per cent., the price of rice did not\r\nfall. On the contrary it rose. This was due largely[87] to the fact\r\nthat people had begun to eat rice who had not before been able to\r\nafford it. Many people who grow rice eat, as has been noted, barley or\r\nbarley mixed with a little rice. From the 'eighties onwards more and\r\nmore rice was eaten.[88]\r\n\r\nThe reason was that, what with the cash obtained from cocoons through\r\nthe enormous development of sericulture,[89] what with the money\r\nreceived by the girls who had gone to the factories, what with the\r\ngrowth of big cities causing an increased demand for vegetables, eggs\r\nand especially fruit at good prices, what with the use of better seed\r\nand more artificial manure, what with agricultural co-operation,\r\npaddy-field adjustment and the taking-in of new land, the farmer, in\r\nspite of increased taxation,[90] was doing better, or at any rate was\r\nminded to live better. In the thirty-years period 1882-1913, his crop\r\nincreased 63 per cent. although his area under cultivation increased\r\nby only 17 per cent. In the following pages we shall hear more of the\r\nmethods by which the farmer's receipts have been increased. We shall\r\nhear also, alas! of the ways in which his expenditure has increased.\r\nHe is indeed in a trying situation. Everything depends on his\r\ncharacter and education and on the influences, social and political,\r\nmoral and religious, under which he lives. That is why this book, in\r\ndevoting itself to an examination of the foundations of an\r\nagricultural country, is concerned with rural sociology rather than\r\nwith the technique of crops and cropping.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding problem of the rice grower is fluctuations in\r\nprice.[91] It is also the problem of the landlord, for rents are fixed\r\nnot at so much money but at so many _koku_ of rice. This means that\r\non rent day the farmer must pay the same amount of rice whether his\r\ncrop has been good or bad. It also means that when the price of rice\r\nrises the amount of rent is automatically raised. If rent were paid,\r\nnot in so many _koku_ of rice but in money at a fixed amount, the\r\nlandlord would know where he was and the tenant would be in an easier\r\nposition, for when the rice crop failed the price would be high and he\r\nwould be able to meet his rent by selling a smaller amount of rice.\r\nThe counsel of the prudent to the rice producer is to build\r\nstorehouses and not to sell the whole of his crop immediately after\r\nharvest, but to extend the sale over the whole year, marketing each\r\nmonth about the same amount if possible. The Government Granary plan\r\ncame into force in 1921, some 3 million _koku_ of unpolished rice\r\nbeing bought in five grades at from 27 yen to 33 yen. In the year\r\nbefore the War rice was selling at 20 yen per _koku_ (5 bushels). The\r\nprevious year (1912) it had been 21 yen--had risen at times to 23\r\nyen--an unheard-of price. Between 1894 and 1912 it had climbed merely\r\nfrom about 7 yen to a maximum of 16 yen.[92] In the year in which the\r\nWar broke out, it dropped as low as 12 yen, and in 1915 it was only 11\r\nyen. By 1916 it had not risen beyond 14 yen.\r\n\r\nThe fall in prices was due to exceptional harvests in 1914 and 1915\r\n(that is, 57,006,541 _koku_ and 55,924,590 _koku_ as compared with the\r\n50,255,000 _koku_ of the year before the War, or the 51,312,000 which\r\nmay be taken as the average of the seven-years period 1907-13). Such\r\nexceptional harvests as those of 1914 and 1915 showed a surplus of\r\nfrom 4½ to 6 million _koku_ over and above the needs of the country,\r\nwhich are roughly estimated at 1 _koku_ per head including infants and\r\nthe old and feeble. In 1916 it was established, when account was taken\r\nof stored rice, that the actual surplus was something like 6 or 7\r\nmillion _koku_. Therefore a fall in price took place. The extent to\r\nwhich rice is imported and exported is shown in Appendix XXIV. This\r\nChapter would become much more technical than is necessary if I\r\nentered into the question of the correctness of rice statistics.\r\nRoughly, the statistics show a production 15 per cent. less than the\r\nactual crops. Formerly the under-estimation was 20 per cent. The\r\npractice has its origin in the old taxation system.\r\n\r\nThe notes for the account of rural life in Japan which will be found\r\nin this book were chiefly made in the second and third years of the\r\nWar. Since that time there has been an enormous rise in the price of\r\neverything. For a time the farmers prospered as they had prospered in\r\nthe high rice-price years, 1912-13.[93] The high prices of all grain\r\nas well as the fabulous price of raw silk (due to increased export to\r\nAmerica and to increased home consumption) were a great advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE'S EFFORTS TO KEEP THE PRICE OF RICE\r\nFROM RISING]\r\n\r\nThen came the rice riots of the city workers, the general slump and\r\nfinally the commercial and industrial crash. Raw silk fell nearly to\r\none-third of its top price, and farmers had to sell cocoons under the\r\ncost of production. Everywhere countrymen and countrywomen employed in\r\nthe factories were discharged in droves. A large proportion of these\r\nunfortunates returned to their villages to dispel some rural dreams of\r\nurban Eldorado.\r\n\r\nBut this matter of the going up and coming down of prices has but a\r\npassing interest for the reader. The only economic fact of which he\r\nneed lay hold is that in recent years the farmers have been led into\r\nthe way of spending more money--in taxation as well as in general\r\nexpenses of living--and that, when account is taken of every advantage\r\nthey have gained from better methods of production, they have pressing\r\non them the limitations imposed by the size of their farms and their\r\nfarming practice. Whatever the prices obtained for the: products of\r\nthe soil, climatic facts,[94] the character and social condition of\r\nthe people, their attitude towards life and authority and the attitude\r\nof authority towards them remain very much the same. And thus a\r\nnarrative of things seen and heard chiefly during the first years of\r\nthe War is not at all out of date even if it were not supplemented as\r\nit is by a plentiful supply of notes containing the latest statistical\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThere is one curious exception only. The reader of these pages will\r\nconstantly come on references to the poverty of the tenant farmers.\r\nThey are, of course, practically labourers, for they cultivate two or\r\nthree acres only, and at the end of the year, as has been shown, have\r\nmerely a trifle in hand and sometimes not that. Influenced by the\r\nlabour movement, which developed in the industrial centres during and\r\nafter the War,[95] this depressed class has of late shown spirit. It\r\nhas begun to assert its claims against landowners. At the end of 1920\r\nthere were as many as ninety associations of tenant farmers, and sixty\r\nof these had been started for the specific purpose of representing\r\ntenants' interests against landowners. Strikes of tenants began and\r\ncontinue. The end of this movement of a proverbially conservative\r\nclass is not at all certain.[96]\r\n\r\nThe outstanding facts which are to be borne in mind about agricultural\r\nJapan are that the population is as thick on the ground as the\r\npopulation of the British Isles (thicker in reality, for so much of\r\nJapan is mountain and waste)--ten times thicker than the population of\r\nthe United States[97]--that Japan is primarily an agricultural\r\ncountry, while Great Britain is largely a manufacturing and trading\r\ncountry, and that only 15½ per cent. of Japan proper (including\r\nHokkaido) is under cultivation against 27 per cent. in Great\r\nBritain.[98] The average area cultivated per farming family in Japan,\r\ncounting paddy and upland together, is less than 3 acres. As the total\r\npopulation of Japan is now (1921) 56 millions (55,960,150 in 1920,\r\nplus the annual increase of 600,000), every acre has to feed close on\r\nfour persons. (\"Even in Hokkaido,\" Dr. Sato notes, \"the average area\r\nper family is only 7½ acres.\") Happily the number of families\r\ncultivating less than 1¼ acres is decreasing and the number\r\ncultivating from 1¼ up to 5 acres is increasing.[99] In other words,\r\nthe favourite size of farm is one which finds work for all the members\r\nof the farmer's family. As on small holdings all over the world, it is\r\nfound that profits are difficult to make when help has to be paid for.\r\nThe facts that in the last four years for which figures are available\r\nthe number of farming families keeping silk-worms has risen by half a\r\nmillion and that every year the area of land under cultivation\r\nincreases show that new ways of increasing income are eagerly seized\r\non.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[80] For estimate of daily consumption of rice by Japanese, see\r\nAppendix XXIII.\r\n\r\n[81] For statistics of imported and exported rice, see Appendix XXIV.\r\n\r\n[82] Japanese.

He appeared to me in the guise of\r\na student of rural sociology.\r\n\r\nUchimura is the man who as a school teacher \"refused to bow before the\r\nEmperor's portrait.\"[100] He endured, as was to be expected, social\r\nostracism and straitened means. But when his voice came to be heard in\r\njournalism it was recognised as the voice of a man of principle by\r\npeople who heard it far from gladly. There is a seamy side to some\r\nJapanese journalism[101] and Uchimura soon resigned his editorial\r\nchair. He abandoned a second editorship because he was determined to\r\nbrave the displeasure of his countrymen by opposing the war with\r\nRussia. To-day he deplores many things in the relations of Japan and\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fuhei_\r\nMUZZLED EDITORS]\r\n\r\nUchimura has written more than two dozen books, mostly on religion.\r\n_How I became a Christian_ has been translated into English, German,\r\nDanish, Russian and Chinese, and is to that extent a landmark in the\r\nliterary history of Japan. His Christianity is an Early Christianity\r\nwhich places him in antagonism, not only to his own countrymen who are\r\nShintoists, Buddhists or Confucians, or vaguely Nationalists, but to\r\nsuch foreign missionaries as are sectarians and literalists. His\r\nearliest training was in agricultural science, and the welfare of the\r\nJapanese countryside is near his heart. If he be a Carlyle, as his\r\nfibre and resolution, downright way of writing and speaking, hortatory\r\ngift, humour, plainness of life and dislike of officials, no less than\r\nhis cast of countenance, his soft hat and long gaberdine-like coat\r\nhave suggested, he is a Carlyle who is content to stay both in body\r\nand mind at Ecclefechan. He is not, however, like Carlyle, whom he\r\ncalls \"master,\" a peasant, but a samurai.\r\n\r\n\"As you penetrate into the lives of the farmers and discover the\r\ninfluences brought to bear on them,\" Uchimura said to me in his\r\ndecisive way, \"there will be laid bare to you _the foundations of\r\nJapan_. You know our proverb, of course, _No wa kuni no taihon nari_\r\n('Agriculture is the basis of a nation')? Have you been to Nikko?\"\r\nThis seemed a little inconsequent, but I told him I had not yet been\r\nto Nikko. (\"Until you have seen Nikko,\" runs the adage, \"do not say\r\n'splendid'.\") \"How many of the tourists who are delighted with Nikko,\"\r\nhe went on, \"have heard how the richest farms near that town were\r\ndevastated? A century ago a minister of the Shogun, who realised that\r\nfertility depended on trees, saw to the whole range of Nikko hills\r\nbeing afforested. It was a tract twenty miles by twenty miles in\r\nextent. But the 'civilised' authorities of our own days sold all the\r\ntimber to a copper company for 8,000 yen. The company destroyed the\r\nfertility of the district not only by cutting down the forest but by\r\npoisoning the water with which the farmers irrigated their crops. A\r\nmember of Parliament gave himself with such devotion to the cause of\r\nthe ruined farmers that when he died the ashes of his cremated body\r\nwere divided and preserved in four shrines erected to his memory.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sad thing, said Uchimura, that the farmers of Japan, because\r\nof the decreased fertility of the land due to the denudation of the\r\nhills of trees, and because of their increased expenses, should be\r\nlaying out \"a quarter of their incomes on artificial manures.\" \"The\r\nenemies which Japan has most to fear to-day,\" Uchimura declared, \"are\r\nimpaired fertility and floods.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be well, perhaps, to explain for a few readers how floods do\r\ntheir ill work. The rain which falls on treeless mountains is not\r\nabsorbed there. The water washes down the mountain sides, bringing\r\nwith it first good soil and then subsoil, stones and rock. The hills\r\neventually become those peaked deserts the queer look of which must\r\nhave puzzled many students of Japanese pictures. The debris washed\r\naway is carried into the rivers, along with trees from the lower\r\nslopes, and the level of the river beds is raised. Because there is\r\nless space in the river beds for water the rivers overflow their\r\nbanks, and disastrous floods take place. The farmers, the local\r\nauthorities and the State raise embankments higher and higher, but\r\nembankment building is costly and cannot go on indefinitely. The real\r\nremedy is to decrease the supply of water by planting forests in the\r\nmountains[102]. In many places the rivers are flowing above the level\r\nof the surrounding country. The imagination is caught by the fact that\r\nthere are four earthquakes a day in Japan[103] and that within a\r\ntwelvemonth fires destroy 400 acres or so of buildings; but every\r\nyear, on an average, floods, tidal waves and typhoons together drown\r\nmore than 600 people and cause a money loss of 25 million yen! Every\r\nyear 10½ million yen are spent by the State and the prefectures on\r\nriver control alone.\r\n\r\nUchimura put on his famous wideawake and we went out for a walk. \"I\r\nshould like,\" he said, \"to press the view that the vaunted expansion\r\nof Japan has meant to the farmers an increase of prices and taxes and\r\nof armaments out of all proportion to our population[104].\"\r\n\r\nUchimura stood stock still in the little wood we had entered. \"There\r\nis one thing more,\" he added gravely. \"Before you can get deeply into\r\nyour subject you must touch religion. There you see the depths of the\r\npeople. A large part of the deterioration of the countryside is due to\r\nthe deterioration of Buddhism. You must ask about it. You will see in\r\nthe villages much of what your old writers used to call 'priestcraft.'\r\nYou will hear of the thraldom of many of the people. You will see with\r\nyour own eyes that real Christianity may be a moral bath for a rural\r\ndistrict.\"\r\n\r\n\"The essentials, not the forms of Christianity,\" he declared, would\r\nsave the countryside by \"brotherly union.\" \"Brotherly union\" would\r\nmake a better life and a better agriculture. The rural class, he\r\nexplained, was more sharply divided than foreigners understood into\r\nowners of land who lived on their rents and farmers who farmed[105].\r\nThe division between the two classes was \"as great as an Indian caste\r\ndivision.\" \"To the landowner who lives in his village like a feudal\r\nlord the simple Gospel, with its insistence on the sacredness of work,\r\ncomes as an intellectual revolution.\" Women as well as men of means\r\nreceived from Christianity \"a new conception of humanity.\" They ceased\r\nto \"look upon their own glory and to take delight in the flattery of\r\npoor people.\" They changed their way of speaking to the peasants. They\r\ndeveloped an interest, of which they knew nothing before, in the\r\nspiritual and material betterment of the men, women and children of\r\ntheir village.\r\n\r\nI went a two-days journey into the country with Uchimura. We stayed at\r\nthe house of a landowner who was one of his adherents. I found myself\r\nin a large room where two swallows were flitting, intent on building\r\non a beam which yearly bore a nest. In this room stood a shrine\r\ncontaining the ancestral tablets. The daily offerings were no longer\r\nmade, but Uchimura's counsel, unlike that of some zealots, was to\r\npreserve not only this shrine but the large family shrine in the\r\ncourtyard. Near by was an engraving of Luther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE JAPANESE CARLYLE.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. AND MRS. YANAGI.]\r\n\r\nUchimura spoke in the house to some thirty or more \"people of the\r\ndistrict who had accepted Christianity.\" His appeal was to \"live\r\nChristianity as given to the world by its founder.\" The address, which\r\nwas delivered from an arm-chair, was based on the fifth chapter of\r\nMatthew, which in the preacher's copy appeared to contain\r\ncross-references to two disciples called Tolstoy and Carlyle. When I\r\nwas asked to speak I found that the women in the gathering had places\r\nin front. \"The remarkable effect of Christianity among those who\r\nhave come to think with us,\" Uchimura told me afterwards, \"is seen\r\nmost in their treatment of women. Our host, had he not been a\r\nChristian, would have been credited by public opinion with the\r\npossession of a concubine, and would not have been blamed for it.\"\r\nWhen, after the speaking, we knelt in a circle and talked less\r\nformally of how best to benefit rural people, we were joined by the\r\nwomen folk. Later, when a dozen of the neighbours were invited to\r\ndinner, it was not served at separate tables for each kneeling guest,\r\nbut at one long table, an innovation \"to indicate the brotherly\r\nrelation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHILDREN CATCHING INSECTS ON RICE-SEED BEDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASTERS OF A COUNTRY SCHOOL AND SOME OF THE CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" said Uchimura, as we walked to the station in the\r\nmorning, \"in an antiquated book, which, I suppose, stands dusty on the\r\nshelves of some of your reformers, there is power to achieve the very\r\nthings they aim at.\" He went on to explain that he looked \"in the\r\nlives of hearers, not in what they say,\" for results from his\r\nteaching. He believed in liberty and freedom, in sowing the seed of\r\nchange and reform and allowing people to develop as they would. \"Let\r\nmen and women believe as they have light.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in his kindly way of how \"the bond of a common faith enables\r\nJapanese to get closer to the foreigner and the foreigner closer to\r\nthe Japanese.\" There were many things we foreigners did not\r\nunderstand. We did not understand, for example, that \"A man's a man\r\nfor a' that\" was an unfamiliar conception to a Japanese. I was to\r\nremember, when I interrogated Japanese about the problems of rural\r\nlife, that they had had to coin a word for \"problems.\" Above all, I\r\nmust be careful not to \"exaggerate the quality of Eastern morality.\"\r\nUchimura asserted sweepingly that \"morality in the Anglo-Saxon sense\r\nis not found in Japan.\" We of the West underrated the value of the\r\npart played by the Puritans in our development. Our moral life had\r\nbeen evolved by the soul-stirring power of the Hebrew prophets and of\r\nChrist. To deny this was \"kicking your own mother.\" Just as it was not\r\npossible for the Briton or American to get his present morality from\r\nGreece and Rome exclusively, it was not possible for the Japanese to\r\nobtain it from the sources at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe faults of the Eastern were that he thought too much of outward\r\nconduct. Good political and neighbourly-relations, kindliness, honesty\r\nand thrift were his idea of morality. \"To love goodness and to hate\r\nevil with one's whole soul is a Christian conception for which you may\r\nsearch in vain through heathendom.\" The horror which the Western man\r\nof high character felt when he thought of the future of the little\r\ngirls in attendance on geisha was not a horror generated by Plato.\r\n\"Heathen life looks nice on the outside to foreigners,\" but\r\nConfucianism, Buddhism and Shintoism had all been weak in their\r\nattitude towards immorality. It was Christianity alone which\r\ncontrolled sexual life. Without deep-seated love of and joy in\r\ngoodness and deep-seated horror of evil it was impossible to reform\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nUchimura said that it had taken him thirty years to reach the\r\nconviction that the best way of raising his countrymen was by\r\npreaching the religion of \"a despised foreign peasant.\" Many things he\r\nhad been told by exponents of Christianity now seemed \"very strange,\"\r\nbut there remained in the first four books of the New Testament, in\r\nthe essence of Christianity, principles \"which would give new life to\r\nall men.\" Moved by this belief, Uchimura and his friends gave their\r\nlives to the work of the Gospel, to a work attended by humiliations;\r\n\"but this is our glory.\"\r\n\r\nJapanese civilisation, he reiterated, was \"only good in the sense that\r\nGreek and Roman civilisations were good.\" Modern Japan represented\r\n\"the best of Europe minus Christianity; the moral backbone of\r\nChristianity is lacking.\" \"Probe a dozen Buddhist priests in turn,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and you find something lacking; you don't find the Buddhist or\r\nConfucian really to be your brother[106].\"\r\n\r\n\"The greatness of England,\" he went on, \"is not due to the inherent\r\ngreatness of the English people, but to the greatness of the truths\r\nwhich they have received.\" In considering the sources of national\r\ngreatness, it was idle to believe that some peoples were original and\r\nsome not original in their ideas and methods. Where were the people to\r\nbe found who were without extraneous influence? Where would England be\r\nwithout Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Christianity?\r\n\r\nOur talk broke off as several peasant women passed us on the narrow\r\nway by the rice fields. The mattocks they carried were the same weight\r\nas their husbands' mattocks and the women were going to do the same\r\nwork as the men. But the women were nearly all handicapped by having a\r\nchild tied on their backs. Uchimura, returning to his objection to\r\nforeign political adventure, said that Japan, properly cultivated,\r\ncould support twice its present population. There were many marshy\r\ndistricts which could be brought into cultivation by drainage. Then\r\nwhat might not forestry do? But the progress could not be made because\r\nof lack of money. The money was needed for \"national defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself,\" said Uchimura, \"I find it still possible to believe in\r\nsome power which will take care of inoffensive, quiet, humble,\r\nindustrious people. If all the high virtues of mankind are not\r\nsafeguarded somehow, then let us take leave of all the ennobling\r\naspirations, all the poetry, and all the deepest hopes we have, and\r\ncease to struggle upward. The question is whether we have faith.\" We\r\nstill waited, he declared, for the nation which would be Christian\r\nenough to take its stand on the Gospel and sacrifice itself\r\nmaterially, if need be, to its faith that right was greater than\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nAnd so \"impractical, outspoken to rashness, but thoroughly sincere and\r\nexperienced,\" as one of his appreciative countrymen characterised him\r\nto me, we take leave of the \"Japanese Carlyle.\" With whom could I have\r\ngone more provocatively towards the foundation of things at the\r\nbeginning of my investigation in farther Japan?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] The statement is, he told me, a calumny. He explained that he\r\nlost his post for refusing to bow, not to the portrait, but to the\r\nsignature of the Emperor, the signature appended to that famous\r\nImperial rescript on education which is appointed to be read in\r\nschools. Uchimura is very willing, he said, to show the respect which\r\nloyal Japanese are at all times ready to manifest to the Emperor, and\r\nhe would certainly bow before the portrait of His Majesty; but in the\r\nproposal that reverence should be paid to the Imperial autograph he\r\nthought he saw the demands of a \"Kaiserism\"--his word, he speaks\r\nvigorous English--which was foreign to the Japanese conception of\r\ntheir sovereign, which would be inimical to the Emperor's influence\r\nand would be bad for the nation.\r\n\r\n[101] But journalism is one of the most powerful influences for good,\r\nand some of the best brains of the country is represented in it.\r\nPapers like the _Jiji, Asahi, Nichi Nichi_, and the Osaka papers run\r\nin conjunction with them have altogether a circulation approaching two\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n[102] For statistics of forests, see Appendix XXXII.\r\n\r\n[103] A severe shook occurs on an average about every six years. The\r\neminent seismologist, Professor Omori, told me that he does not expect\r\nan earthquake of a dangerous sort for a generation.\r\n\r\n[104] The _Oriental Economist_, a Japanese publication, in the autumn\r\nof 1921 suggested the abandonment of all the extensions to the Empire\r\non the score that they had not been a benefit to Japan, and that she\r\nwas in no way dependent on them.

At last the good man\r\nyielded, and told them that a Chinaman in a red robe was coming\r\ntowards the village the next day and his head might be taken. On the\r\nmorrow the men lay in wait for the stranger, sprang on him and cut off\r\nhis head, only to find that it was the head of their beloved\r\nmissionary. Struck with remorse and realising the evil of head taking,\r\nthe tribe gave up head hunting for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE IDEA OF A GAP\r\n\r\nBold is the donkey driver, O Khedive, and bold is the Khedive who\r\ndares to say what he will believe, not knowing in any wise the mind of\r\nAllah, not knowing in any wise his own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Japanese Carlyle\" is getting grey. It seemed well to seek out\r\nsome young Japanese thinker and take his view of that \"heathenism\"\r\nconcerning which Uchimura had delivered himself so unsparingly. Let me\r\nspeak of my first visit to my friend Yanagi.\r\n\r\nAs a youth Yanagi was a lonely student. He took his own way to\r\nknowledge and religion. The famed General Nogi had been given by the\r\nEmperor the direction of the Peers' School, but even under such\r\ndistinguished tutelage the stripling made his stand. His reading led\r\nhim to write for the school magazine an anti-militarist article. The\r\nveteran, as I once learned from a friend of Yanagi, promptly paraded\r\nthe school, boys and masters. He spoke of disloyal, immoral,\r\nsubversive ideas, and bade the youthful disturber of the peace attend\r\nhim at his own house. When Yanagi stood before Nogi and was asked what\r\nhe had to say, he replied with the question, \"Don't you feel pain\r\nbecause of sending so many men to death before Port Arthur[107]?\"\r\n\r\nAgain I found my prophet in a cottage. It was a cottage overlooking\r\nrice fields and a lagoon. From the Japanese scene outdoors I passed\r\nindoors to a new Japan. Cezanne, Puvis de Chavannes, Beardsley, Van\r\nGogh, Henry Lamb, Augustus John, Matisse and Blake--Yanagi has written\r\na big book on Blake which is in a second edition--hung within sight\r\nof a grand piano and a fine collection of European music[108].\r\nChinese, Korean and Japanese pottery and paintings filled the places\r\nin the dwelling not occupied by Western pictures and the Western\r\nlibrary of a man well advanced with an interpretative history of\r\nEastern and Western mysticism. An armful of books about Blake and\r\nBoehme, all Swedenborg, all Carlyle, all Emerson, all Whitman, all\r\nShelley, all Maeterlinck, all Francis Thompson, and all Tagore, and\r\nplenty of other complete editions; early Christian mystics; much of\r\nWilliam Law, Bergson, Eucken, Caird, James, Haldane, Bertrand Russell,\r\nJefferies, Havelock Ellis, Carpenter, Strindberg, \"Æ,\" Yeats, Synge\r\nand Shaw; not a little poetry of the fashion of Vaughan, Traherne and\r\nCrashaw; a well-thumbed Emily Brontë; all the great Russian novelists;\r\nnumbers of books on art and artists--it was an arresting collection to\r\ncome on in a Japanese hamlet, and odd to sit down beside it in order\r\nto talk of \"heathen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Yanagi--he speaks an English which reflects his wide\r\nreading--\"our young maid, on being shown the full moon the other\r\nnight, bowed her head. I find this natural instinct of some value. Our\r\npeople have much natural feeling towards Nature. If modern Japanese\r\nart has degenerated it is because it does not sufficiently find out\r\nlife in things. The sough of the wind in the trees may have only a\r\nslight influence on character, but it is a vital influence. I do not\r\nlike, of course, the word 'heathendom' of which Uchimura seems so\r\nfond. I dearly admire Christ, but most of the Christianity of to-day\r\nis not Christ. It is largely Paul. It is a mixture. It is not the\r\nclear, pure, original thing. Christians must reform their Christianity\r\nbefore it can satisfy us. In the East we now see clearly enough to\r\nseek only the best that the West can offer.\"\r\n\r\nYanagi said that the spontaneity and naturalness of Eastern religions\r\nought to be recognised. \"You will find Christians admiring Walt\r\nWhitman, but it is Whitman the democrat they admire, not Whitman the\r\nprophet of naturalness.\" He spoke with appreciation of the Zen sect\r\nof Buddhists. Many of the Zen devotees were \"noble and had a profound\r\nidea.\" He was unable to see \"any difference at all\" between the best\r\npart of Buddhism and the best part of Christianity. He said that his\r\nown mysticism was based on science, art, religion and philosophy. \"My\r\nsincerest wish,\" he declared, \"is to produce a beautiful\r\nreconciliation of these four. As it is, too often scientists and\r\nphilosophers have no deep knowledge of religion or art, artists have\r\nno deep knowledge of religion or science, and the religious have no\r\nidea of art. Surely the deepest religious idea is the deepest artistic\r\nand philosophic idea. Perhaps our scientists are in the poorest state\r\njust now with no understanding of art or religion. Our scientists are\r\nimmersed in the problem of matter, our religious people in the problem\r\nof spirit, and our artists forget that in dealing with nature they are\r\ndealing with spirit as well as body.\"\r\n\r\nFaced by force and science when Commander Perry came, Japan, in order\r\nto save herself from foreign colonisation, had had to concentrate all\r\nher attention on force and science. She had concentrated her attention\r\nwith signal success. But naturally she had had, in the process, to\r\nslacken her hold somewhat on the spiritual life.\r\n\r\n\"Always remember how difficult the Japanese find it to know which way\r\nto take. Their whole basis has been shaken and on the surface all has\r\nbecome chaotic. Ten years hence it will be possible to take a just\r\nview. There is much reason for high hopes. For one thing, the burden\r\nof old thought does not rest so heavily on us as might be supposed. We\r\nare very free in many ways. In the matter of religion Japan is the\r\nmost free nation in the world. If England were to become Buddhist it\r\nwould sound strange or exotic, but Japan is free to become what she\r\nmay.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be a great difference between one of our temples and\r\nshrines and an English church,\" Yanagi proceeded, \"but I cannot\r\nbelieve in the gap which some people seem to see yawning between East\r\nand West. It is deplorable that the world should think that there is\r\nsuch a complete difference between East and West. It is usually said\r\nthat self-denial, asceticism, sacrifice, negation are opposed to\r\nself-affirmation, individualism, self-realisation; but I do not\r\nbelieve in such a gap. I wish to destroy the idea of a gap. It is an\r\nidea which was obtained analytically. The meeting of East and West\r\nwill not be upon a bridge over a gap, but upon the destruction of the\r\nidea of a gap.\r\n\r\n\"In future, religion cannot be limited by this or that sect or idea.\r\nReligion cannot be limited to Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism or\r\nMahomedanism. Uchimura says that it is the essence of Christianity\r\nwhich has the power to rescue Japan from its chaotic state. But the\r\nessence of Buddhism can also contribute some important element to the\r\nfuture of Japan. The notion that the essence of Christianity and the\r\nessence of Buddhism are far apart is artificial and prejudiced.\"\r\n\r\nOne day some weeks later I walked with Yanagi on the hills. He said:\r\n\"The weakest point in the Japanese character is the lack of the power\r\nof questioning. We are repressed by our educational system. And so\r\nmany things come here at one time that it makes confusion. What is so\r\noften taken for a lack of originality in us is a state resulting from\r\nan immense importation of foreign ideas. They have been overpowering.\r\nMany of us have no clear ideas on life, society, sex and so on, and\r\nyou will find it difficult to get satisfactory answers to many\r\nquestions which you will want to ask.\"\r\n\r\nAs to morality, it was dangerous to say \"this or that is immoral.\"\r\nMorality was often merely custom. Ordinary morality had scant\r\nauthority. Critics of Japanese morality should not forget that, in the\r\nopinion of Japanese, Western people were more erotic than they were.\r\nWestern dancing--not to speak of Western women's evening costumes--was\r\nundoubtedly more erotic than Japanese dancing. Again, the sexual\r\ncuriosity of foreigners seemed stronger than that manifested by\r\nJapanese. It was a well-known fact that the girls at many hotels and\r\nrestaurants had not a little to complain of from foreign men who\r\nmisjudged their naïve ways. It must be remembered that Japanese were\r\nfranker in sexual matters than Europeans and Americans. Sexual\r\nill-doing was not so much concealed as in Europe. A wrong impression\r\nof Japanese morality was taken away by tourists whose guides showed\r\nthem, as in Paris, what they expected to see.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"that Western visitors to Tokyo who talk of our\r\nimmorality are not struck by the fact that in an Eastern capital a\r\nforeign lady may walk home at night and be practically safe from being\r\nspoken to. The Japanese are undoubtedly a very kind people. They may\r\nbe unmoral, but they are not immoral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of our people do not understand liberty in the mental sexual\r\nrelations. Love is not free. In a very large proportion of cases,\r\nindeed, parents would oppose a match because a son or daughter had\r\nfallen in love. And if it is difficult to marry for love it is not\r\neasy to fall in love.[109] Society in which young men and young women\r\nmeet is restricted; there are few opportunities of conversation.\r\nWithout liberty towards women there can be no perfect sense of\r\nresponsibility towards them.\"\r\n\r\nWhat had been taught to women as the supreme virtue was the virtue of\r\nsacrifice for father, husband, children. It was most important to let\r\nwomen know the significance of individualism. They were always\r\noffering themselves for others before they became themselves. But the\r\nidea of individuality was very little clearer to the Japanese man than\r\nto the Japanese woman. People were too prone to wish to give 100 yen\r\nbefore they had 100 yen. The Japanese were the most devotional people\r\nin the world, but they hardly knew yet the things to be devoted to.\r\n\r\nYanagi is a leading member of a small association of literary men,\r\nartists and students who graduated together from the Peers' School.\r\nThey call themselves for no obvious reason the Shirakaba or Silver\r\nBirch Society. The intelligent and consistent efforts of these young\r\nmen to introduce vital Western work in literature, philosophy,\r\npainting, sculpture, draughtsmanship and music, and the large measure\r\nof success they have attained is of some significance. Several members\r\nof the group belong to the old Kuge families, that is the ancient\r\nnobility which surrounded the Emperor at Kyoto before the\r\nRestoration. Cut off for centuries from military and administrative\r\nactivities by the dominance of the Shogunate Government, the Kuge\r\ndevoted themselves to the arts and the refinements of life. For the\r\nexclusiveness of the past some of their descendants substitute\r\nartistic integrity. The Shirakaba has had for several years a\r\nremarkable magazine. Its editor and its publisher, its size, its price\r\nand its date of publication are continually changed; it never makes\r\nany bid for popularity; it expresses its sentiments in a downright way\r\nand it has always been anti-official: yet it survives and pays its\r\nway. Beyond the magazine, the Society has had every year at least one\r\nexhibition of what its members conceive to be significant modern\r\nEuropean work. The members have also supported a few Japanese artists\r\nof outstanding sincerity. Through the Shirakaba the influence of\r\nCezanne, Van Gogh, Rodin, Blake, Delacroix, Matisse, Augustus John,\r\nBeardsley, Courbet, Daumier, Maillol, Chavannes and Millet,\r\nparticularly Cezanne, Van Gogh, Rodin and Blake, has been marked. The\r\nSilver Birch group has never tired of extolling the great names of\r\nRembrandt, Dürer, El Greco, Van Eyck, Goya, Leonardo, Michael Angelo,\r\nTintoretto, Giotto and Mantegna[110].\r\n\r\nWhile an ardent Young Japan has formed and dissolved many societies,\r\nmovements and fashions, this Shirakaba group has held fast and has\r\ngained friends by its sincerity, its vision and its audacity[111].\r\nRodin encouraged the Shirakaba efforts to reproduce the best Western\r\nart by presenting it with three pieces of sculpture.\r\n\r\n\"The intellectual man does no fighting,\" Froude has written. Why do\r\nnot Yanagi and his friends make a stand on public questions?\r\n\"Because,\" he said, \"at the present stage of our development it is\r\nalmost impossible to take up a strong attitude, and because, important\r\nthough political and social questions are, they are not, in our\r\nopinion, of the first importance. To artists, philosophers, students\r\nof religion, such problems are secondary. More important problems are:\r\nWhat is the meaning of this world? What is God? What is the essence of\r\nreligion? How can we best nourish ourselves so as to realise our own\r\npersonalities? Political and social problems are secondary for us at\r\npresent; they are not related emotionally to our present\r\nconditions[112].\r\n\r\n        For the East the Root,\r\n        For the West the Fruit.\r\n\r\n\"If we faced such problems directly we should probably make them\r\nprimary problems, as you do in Great Britain. Our present attitude\r\ndoes not prove, however, that we are cold to political and social\r\nproblems. In fact, when we think of these terrible political and\r\nsocial questions they make us boil. But you will understand that in\r\norder to have something to give to others, we must have that\r\nsomething. We are seeking after that something.\"\r\n\r\nYanagi, continuing, spoke of the direct contribution which the new\r\nartistic movement in Japan, under the influence of modern Western art,\r\nwas making to the solution of political and social questions[113]. The\r\ninterest of the younger generation in Post Impressionism was \"quite\r\ndisharmonious with the ordinary attitude towards militarism.\"\r\nEuropean art broke down barriers in the Japanese mind. When the\r\nyounger generation, nourished on higher ideals, grew up, it would be\r\nthe State, and there would be a more hopeful condition of affairs.\r\nPeople generally supposed that social questions were the most\r\npractical; but religious, artistic, philosophic questions were, in the\r\ntruest sense of the word, the most practical.\r\n\r\nYanagi went on to tell of his devotion to Blake. He could not\r\nunderstand \"why Englishmen are so cool to him.\" He asked me how it was\r\nthat there was no word about Blake in Andrew Lang's work on English\r\nliterature. \"I cannot imagine,\" he said, \"why such an intelligent man\r\ncould not appreciate Blake.\" Yanagi regarded Blake as \"the artist of\r\nimmense will, of immense desire, and a man in whom can be seen that\r\naffirmative attitude towards life, exhibited later by Whitman.\" Yanagi\r\nspoke also of \"Anglo-Saxon nobility, liberty, depth of character and\r\nhealthiness,\" and of \"a deep and noble character\" in English\r\nliterature which he did not find elsewhere. Whitman, Emerson, Poe and\r\nWilliam James were \"the crown of America.\"\r\n\r\nAs I close this chapter I recall Yanagi's library, in the service of\r\nwhich, bettering Mark Pattison's example, two-thirds of its owner's\r\nincome was for some time expended. I remember the thatched dwelling\r\noverlooking the quiet reed-bound lagoon with its frosty sunrises, red\r\nmoonrises and apparitions of Fuji above the clouds seventy miles away.\r\nNo Western visitor whom I took to Abiko failed to be moved by that\r\nroom, designed by Yanagi himself in every detail, wherein East meets\r\nWest in harmony. I have made note of his Western books but not of the\r\nclassics and strange mystic writings of Chinese and Korean priests in\r\npiles of thin volumes in soft bindings of blue or brown. I have not\r\nmentioned a Rembrandt drawing and next to it the vigorous but restful\r\nbrush lines of an artist priest of the century that brought Buddhism\r\nto Japan; severe little gilt-bronze figures of deities from China, a\r\nlittle older; pottery figures of exquisite beauty from the tombs of\r\nTang, a little later; Sung pottery, a dynasty farther on; Korai\r\nceladons from Korean tombs of the same epoch; and whites and blue and\r\nwhites of Ming and Korean Richo. On the wall a black and yellow tiger\r\nis \"burning bright\" on a strip of blood-red silk tapestry woven on a\r\nChinese loom for a Taoist priest 500 years ago. Cimabue's portrait of\r\nSt. Francis breathes over Yanagi's writing desk from one side, while\r\nfrom the other Blake's amazing life mask looks down \"with its Egyptian\r\npower of form added to the intensity of Western individualism.\" These\r\nare Yanagi's silent friends. His less quiet friends of the flesh have\r\nfelt that this room was a sanctuary and Yanagi a priest of eternal\r\nthings, but a priest without priestcraft, a priest living joyously in\r\nthe world. Above his desk is inscribed the line of Blake:\r\n\r\n        Thou also, dwellest in eternity\r\n\r\nand Kepler's aspiration, \"My wish is that I may perceive God whom I\r\nfind everywhere in the external world in like manner within and\r\nwithout me.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] One of the reasons assigned for the suicide of the General was\r\nthoughts of his responsibility for the terrible slaughter in the\r\nassaults on Port Arthur.\r\n\r\n[108] Mrs. Yanagi is one of the best contraltos heard at the now\r\nnumerous Japanese concerts of Western music.\r\n\r\n[109] _Shinjū_, or suicide for love, the girl often being a geisha, is\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n[110] \"I am inclined to think,\" wrote Yanagi in 1921, in a paper on\r\nKorean art, \"that we have paid if anything rather too much attention\r\nto European works while making little effort to pay attention to what\r\nlies much nearer to us.\"\r\n\r\n[111] POLICE STANDARDS.--The sale of one issue of the magazine was\r\nprohibited by the police, who found a nude \"antagonistic to the\r\nordinary standard of public morals.\" The editors' answer next\r\nmonth--the police standard being, \"No front views\"--was to publish\r\nhalf a dozen more nudes with their backs to the reader.\r\n\r\n[112] It will be remembered that this conversation took place in the\r\nsummer of 1915 at the outset of my investigation. Since then, as noted\r\nthroughout this book, economic questions have increasingly pressed\r\nthemselves forward. I may mention that in 1919 Yanagi wrote a\r\nvigorous and moving protest against misgovernment in Korea. In a\r\nrecent letter to me he says: \"You know that I am going to establish a\r\nKorean Folk Art Society in Seoul. This is a big work, but I want to do\r\nit with all my power for love of Korea. I approach the solution of the\r\nKorean question by the way of Art. Politics can never solve the\r\nquestion. I want to use the gallery as a meeting-place of Koreans and\r\nJapanese. People cannot quarrel in beauty. This is my simple yet\r\ndefinite belief.\" Yanagi's manifesto on his project made one think of\r\nthe age when the great culture of China and India glowed across the\r\nstraits of Tsushima in the wake of early Buddhism.\r\n\r\n[113] A well-known member of the Shirakaba group started two years ago\r\nan \"ideal village\" among the mountains. It is an effort towards social\r\nfreedom in which the police manifest a continuous interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS JAPAN (TOKYO TO NIIGATA AND\r\nBACK)\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTO THE HILLS\r\n\r\n(TOKYO, SAITAMA, TOCHIGI AND FUKUSHIMA)\r\n\r\nNothing which concerns a _countryman_ is a matter of unconcern to\r\nme.--TERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July I went from one side of Japan to the other,\r\nstarting from Tokyo, across the sea from which lies America, and\r\ncoming out at Niigata, across the sea from which lies Siberia.\r\n\r\nWe first made a four hours' railway run through the great Kwanto plain\r\n(6,000 square miles). Travelling is comfortable on such a trip, for\r\ntravellers take off their coats and waistcoats, and the train-boy--he\r\nhas the word \"Boy\" on his collar in English--brings fans and bedroom\r\nslippers. The fans, which on one side advertised \"Hotels in European\r\nstyle, directly managed by the Imperial Government Railway[114],\"\r\noffered on the other a poem and a drawing. A poem addressed to a snail\r\nplayed with the idea of its giving its life to climbing Fuji. The poem\r\nwas composed by a poet who wrote many delightful _hokku_\r\n(seventeen-syllable poems), showing a humorous sympathy with the\r\nhumblest creatures. One poem is:\r\n\r\n        Come and play with me,\r\n        Thou orphan sparrow!\r\n\r\nLike Burns, Issa addressed a poem to a louse.\r\n\r\nAs we climbed from the vicinity of the sea to higher lands someone\r\nrecalled the saying about saints living in the mountains and sages by\r\nthe sea. Speaking of religion, one man said that he had known of\r\npeople giving half their income to religious purposes. He also\r\nmentioned that for some years his mother had gone to hear a sermon in\r\na Japanese Christian church every Sunday, but she still served her\r\nBuddhist shrine.\r\n\r\nIt was at an inn at the hot spring near the Mount Nasu volcano--the\r\nodour of the sulphurous hot water was everywhere in the district--that\r\nI first enjoyed the attentions of the blind _amma_ (_masseur_ or\r\n_masseuse_), the call of whose plaintive pipe is heard every evening\r\nin the smallest community. _Amma san_ rubbed and pommelled me for an\r\nhour for 28 sen. The _amma_ does not massage the skin, but works\r\nthrough the _yukata_ (bath gown) of the patient. I had my massaging as\r\nI knelt with the other guests of the inn at an entertainment arranged\r\nfor the benefit of residents. The entertainers, professional and\r\nnon-professional--the non-professionals were local farmers--knelt on a\r\nlow platform or danced in front of it. They were extraordinarily able.\r\nA dramatic tale by one of the story-tellers was about a yokelish young\r\nwrestler and a daimyo. Another described the woes and suicide of an\r\nold-time Court lady.\r\n\r\nThe next day we started on foot on a seven miles' climb of the\r\nvolcano. Its lower slopes were covered with a variety of that\r\nknee-high bamboo with a creeping root, which is so troublesome to\r\nfarmers when they break up new ground. One variety is said to blossom\r\nand fruit once in sixty years and then die. An ingenious professor has\r\ntraced mice plagues to this habit. In the year in which the bamboo\r\nfruits the mice increase and multiply exceedingly. Suddenly their food\r\nsupply gives out and they descend to the plains to live with the\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nAt length we came in sight of the smoke and vapour of the volcano.\r\nSoon we were near the top, where the white trunks and branches of dead\r\ntrees and scrub, killed by falling ash or gusts of vapour, dotted an\r\nawesome desolation of calcined and fused stone and solidified mud. At\r\nthe summit we looked down into the churning horror of the volcano's\r\nvat and at different spots saw the treacly sulphur pouring out,\r\nbrilliant yellow with red streaks. The man to whom there first came\r\nthe idea of hell and a prisoned revengeful power must surely have\r\nlooked into a crater. In the throat of this crater there seethed and\r\nspluttered an ugliness that was scarlet, green, brown and yellow. The\r\nsound of the steam blowing off was like the roar of the sea. The air\r\nwas stifling. It was very hot, and there was a high eerie wind.\r\n\r\nAdventurous men had built rude bulwarks of stone over some of the\r\norifices, and in this way had compelled the volcano to furnish them\r\nwith sulphur free from dirt. The production of sulphur in Japan is\r\nvalued at close on three million yen.\r\n\r\nAs we went on our journey we spoke of the sturdiness and cheeriness of\r\nour chief carrier, who had told us that he was seventy. I asked him if\r\nhe thought it fair that he should have to walk so far on a hot day\r\nwith so much to carry while we were empty-handed. He replied that it\r\nmight appear to be unjust, but that he was happy enough. He said that\r\nhe had lived long and seen many things, and he knew that to be rich\r\nwas not always to be happy. He quoted the proverb, \"Sunshine and rice\r\nmay be found everywhere,\" and the poem which may be rendered, \"If you\r\nlook at a water-fowl thoughtlessly you may imagine that she has\r\nnothing to do but float quietly on the water, yet she is moving her\r\nfeet ceaselessly beneath the surface.\"\r\n\r\nAt the little hot spring inn where we next stayed, insect powder was\r\non sale, not without reasonable hope of patronage by the guests. The\r\n_Asahi_ once facetiously reported that I had taken on a journey three\r\n_to_ (six pecks) of insect powder. The chief protector of the prudent\r\ntraveller in remote Japan is a giant pillowslip of cotton. He gets\r\ninto it and ties the strings together under his chin. The mats and\r\nfuton of old-fashioned hotels are full of fleas. The hard cylindrical\r\nJapanese pillow has no doubt its tenants also, but I never got\r\naccustomed to using it, and laid my head on a doubled-up kneeling\r\ncushion.\r\n\r\nA foot-high partition separated the men's hot bath from the women's.\r\nMy cold bath in the morning I found I had to take unselfconsciously at\r\na water-gush in front of the house. As the food was poor here, we\r\nwere glad of our tinned food and ship's biscuits. This was of course\r\nin a remote part. Apart from ordinary Japanese food, there are usually\r\navailable at the inns chicken, fish of some sort, eggs, omelettes and\r\nsoups. With a pot of jam or two and some powdered milk in one's bag,\r\none can live fairly well. Fresh milk can now be got in unlikely places\r\non giving notice overnight. It is produced for invalids and children.\r\nIf one makes no fuss, remembers one is a traveller who has resolved to\r\nsee rural Japan, and realises that the inn people will try to do their\r\nbest, one will not fare so badly. On the railway one is well catered\r\nfor by the provision of _bento_ (lunch) boxes, sold on the platforms\r\nof stations. These chip boxes contain rice (hot), cold omelette, cold\r\nfish or chicken and assorted pickles, and provide an appetising and\r\ninexpensive meal.\r\n\r\nMonkeys, bears and antelopes are shot in this district. One man spoke\r\nof a troop of eighty monkeys. In the high mountain regions there are\r\nstill people who escape the census and live a wild life. The records\r\nof a gipsy folk called Sanka have a history going back 700 or 800\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAs we wound our way up and down the hill-sides we saw evidence of\r\n\"fire-farming.\" It is the simple method by which a small tract with a\r\nfavourable aspect is cleared by fire and cultivated, and then, when\r\nthe fertility is exhausted, abandoned. I was assured that after\r\nfire-farming \"tea springs up naturally,\" and that though tea-drinking\r\nmay have been introduced from China there could not be such large\r\nareas of tea growing wild if tea were not indigenous.\r\n\r\nMost of our paths lay through woods and matted vegetation. I noticed\r\nthat trees were often felled in order that mushrooms might be grown on\r\nand around their trunks. There is a large consumption of these\r\ntree-grown mushrooms in Japan and an export trade worth two and a half\r\nmillion yen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CULTIVATION TO THE HILL-TOPS.]\r\n\r\nAn inscribed stone by our path was a reminder of the belief in\r\n\"mountain maidens.\" They have the undoubted merit of not being \"so\r\npeevish as fairies.\" At another stone, before which was a pile of\r\nsmall stones, a farmer told us that when a traveller threw a stone\r\non the heap he \"left behind his tiredness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPLEMENTS, MEASURES AND MACHINES, AND A BALE OF RICE]\r\n\r\nIn the first house we came to we found a young widow turning bowls\r\nwith power from a water-wheel. She could finish 400 bowls in a day and\r\ngot from one to five sen apiece. She said that she had often wished to\r\nsee a foreigner. Like nearly all the girls and women of the hills, she\r\nwore close-fitting blue cotton trousers.\r\n\r\nWe descended to a kind of prairie which had a tree here and there and\r\nroughly wooded hills on either side. This brought us to the problem of\r\nthe wise method of dealing with the enormous wood-bearing areas of the\r\ncountry, the timber crop of which is so irregular in quality. Japan\r\nrequires many more scientifically planned forests. As coal is not in\r\ndomestic use, however, large quantities of cheap wood are needed for\r\nburning and for charcoal making. The demand for hill pasture is also\r\nincreasing. How shall the claims of good timber, good firewood, good\r\ncharcoal-making material and good pasture be reconciled? In the county\r\nthrough which we were passing--a county which, owing to its large\r\nconsumption of wood fuel, needs relatively little charcoal--the\r\ncharcoal output was worth as much as 35,000 yen a year.\r\n\r\nWe saw \"buckwheat in full bloom as white as snow,\" as the Chinese poem\r\nsays. At a farmhouse there was a box fixed on a barn wall. It was for\r\ncommunications for the police from persons who desired to make their\r\nsuggestions for the public welfare privately.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, when we had done about twenty miles, I managed to\r\ntwist an ankle. Happily I had the chance of a ride. It was on the back\r\nof a dour-looking mare which was accompanied by her foal and tied by a\r\nhalter to the saddle of a led pack-horse which was carrying two large\r\nboxes. Thus impressively I did several miles in descending darkness\r\nand across the rocky beds of two rivers. The horse of this district is\r\na downcast-looking animal in spite of the fact that it is stalled\r\nunder the same roof as its owner and is thus able to share to some\r\nextent in his family life.\r\n\r\nAt the town at which we at last arrived, the comfort of the hot bath\r\nwas enhanced by a sturdy lass of the inn who unasked and unannounced\r\ncame and applied herself resolutely to scrubbing and knuckling our\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\nThe next day I went to the principal school. There were in the place\r\nthree primary schools, one with a branch for agricultural work. The\r\n\"attendance\" at the principal school, where there were 379 boys and\r\ngirls, was 98 per cent, for the boys and 94 per cent, for the\r\ngirls.[115] The buildings were most creditable to a small place fifty\r\nmiles from a railway station. The community had met the whole cost out\r\nof its official funds and by subscriptions. More than half the\r\nexpenditure of many a village is on education, which in Japan is\r\ncompulsory but not free. One cannot but be impressed by the pride\r\nwhich is taken in the local schools. The dominating man-made feature\r\nof the landscape is less frequently than might be supposed a temple or\r\na shrine: where the picture which catches the eye is not the vast\r\nexpanse of the crops of the plain or the marvels of terracing for hill\r\ncrops, it is the long, low school building, set almost invariably on\r\nthe best possible site. The poorly paid men and women teachers are\r\nearnest and devoted, and their influence must be far-reaching. They\r\nare rewarded in part, no doubt, by the respect which pupils and the\r\ngeneral public give to the _sensei_ (teacher).[116] At the school I\r\nvisited, the children, as is customary, swept and washed out the\r\nschoolrooms and kept the playground trim. Above one teacher's desk\r\nwere the following admonitions:\r\n\r\n        Be obedient.\r\n        Be decent.\r\n        Be active.\r\n        Be social.\r\n        Be serious.\r\n\r\n\"Be serious\"!--graver small folk sit in no schools in the world. Here,\r\nas usual, corporal punishment was never given. I suggested to teachers\r\nall sorts of juvenile delinquencies, but their faith in the\r\nsufficiency of reprimands, of \"standing out\" and of detention after\r\nschool hours was unshaken.\r\n\r\nA new wing, a beautiful piece of carpenter's work, had cost 4,000 yen,\r\na large sum in Japan, where wood and village labour are equally cheap.\r\nIt was to be used chiefly for the gymnastics which are steadily adding\r\nto the stature of the Japanese people. At one end there was an\r\nopening, about 20 ft. across and 5 ft. deep, designed as an honourable\r\nplace for the portraits of the Emperor and Empress, which are solemnly\r\nexposed to view on Imperial birthdays[117].\r\n\r\nApart from a local spirit of pride and emulation and a belief in\r\neducation, one of the reasons for the building of new schools and\r\nadding to old ones is to be found in the recent extension of the\r\nperiod of compulsory attendance. It used to be from six to ten years\r\nof age; it is now from six to twelve. The visitor to Japan usually\r\nunder-estimates the ages of children because they are so small.\r\nJapanese boys grow suddenly from about fifteen to sixteen.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of this county, with a population of 35,000, there were,\r\nI learnt at the county offices, 22 elementary schools with 36 branch\r\nschools, 3 secondary schools and 17 winter schools. Within the same\r\narea there were 46 Buddhist temples with about 60 priests, and 125\r\nShinto shrines with 11 priests.\r\n\r\nThe chief police officer, in chatting with me, mentioned that, out of\r\n71 charges of theft, only 47 were proceeded with. When charges were\r\nnot proceeded with it was either because restitution had been made or\r\nthe chief constable had exercised his discretion and dismissed the\r\noffender with a reprimand. When transgressors are dismissed with a\r\nreprimand an eye is kept on them for a year. As the Japanese are in\r\nconsiderable awe of their police, I have no doubt that, as was\r\nexplained to me, those who have lapsed into evil-doing, but are\r\nreleased from custody with a warning, may \"tremble and correct their\r\nconduct.\" In the whole county in a year 14,400 admonitions were given\r\nat 14 police stations. The noteworthy thing in the criminal\r\nstatistics is the small proportion of crime against women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the county was in a remote part of Japan may be held,\r\nperhaps, to account for the fact that there were in it, I was assured,\r\nonly 14 geisha and 8 women known to be of immoral character. All of\r\nthem were living in the town and they were said to be chiefly\r\npatronised by commercial travellers and imported labourers. I was told\r\nthat there were pre-nuptial relations between many young men and young\r\nwomen. Two undoubted authorities in the district agreed that they\r\ncould not answer for the chastity of any young men before marriage or\r\nof \"as many as 10 per cent.\" of the young women. In an effort to save\r\nthe reputation of their daughters, fathers sometimes register\r\nillegitimate children as the offspring of themselves and their wives.\r\nOr when an unmarried girl is about to have a child her father may call\r\nthe neighbours to a feast and announce to them the marriage of his\r\ndaughter to her lover. The figures for illegitimate births are\r\nvitiated by the fact that in Japan children are recorded as\r\nillegitimate who are born to people who have omitted to register their\r\notherwise respectable unions.[118]\r\n\r\nIn the county in which I was travelling I was assured that half the\r\nstill births might be put down to immoral relations and half to\r\nimperfect nourishment or overworking of the mother. In this district\r\ngirls marry from 17 or 18, men from 18 to 30.\r\n\r\nThe town was full of country people who had come to see the festival.\r\nOne feature of it was the performance of plays on four ancient wheeled\r\nstages of a simplicity in construction that would have delighted\r\nWilliam Poel. Formerly these plays were given by the local youths; now\r\nprofessional actors are employed. The different acts of the historical\r\ndramas which were performed were divided into half a dozen scenes, and\r\nwhen one of these scenes had been enacted the stage was wheeled\r\nfarther along the street. At the conclusion of each scene some three\r\ndozen small boys, all wearing the white-and-black speckled cotton\r\nkimono and German caps which are the common wear of lads throughout\r\nJapan, would swarm up on the stage, and, with fans waved downwards,\r\nwould yell at the pitch of their voices an ancient jingle, which\r\nseemed to signify \"Push, push, push and go on!\" This was addressed to\r\na score or so of young men who with loud shouts hauled the heavy\r\nstage-wagon along the street. The performances on the four moving\r\ntheatres went on simultaneously and sometimes the cars passed one\r\nanother. The performances were given on the eve and on the day and\r\nthrough the night of the festival. The acting was amazingly good,\r\nconsidering the July heat and the cramped conditions in which the\r\nactors worked. Happy boys sat at the back of the scenes fanning the\r\nplayers. Our kindly and voluble landlady was not satisfied with the\r\nnumber of times the stages stopped before her inn. She loudly\r\nthreatened the youths who were dragging them that she would reclaim\r\nsome properties she had lent and tell her dead husband of their\r\ningratitude!\r\n\r\nAt one of the booths which had been opened for the festival by a\r\nstrolling company there were women actors, contrary to the convention\r\nof the Japanese stage on which men enact female rôles and in doing so\r\nuse a special falsetto. Some of these actresses performed men's parts.\r\nAt every performance in a Japanese theatre, as I have already\r\nmentioned, a policeman is provided with a chair on a special platform,\r\nor in an otherwise favourable position, so that he can view and if\r\nnecessary censor what is going on. The constable at this particular\r\nplay was kind enough to offer me his seat. The rest of the audience\r\nwas content with the floor. The poor little company of players brought\r\nto their work both ability and an artistic conscience, but they had to\r\ndo everything in the rudest way. They were in no way embarrassed by\r\nthe attendants frequently trimming the inferior oil lamps on the\r\nstage. A little girl on the floor, entranced by the performance on the\r\nstage, or curious about some detail of it, ran forward and laid her\r\nchin on the boards and studied the actors at leisure. The folk in the\r\nfront row of the gallery dangled their naked legs for coolness.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends asked me how we managed in the West to identify the\r\npeople who wanted to leave the theatre between the acts. I explained\r\nthat as our performances did not last from early afternoon until\r\nnearly midnight it was rare for anyone to wish to leave a theatre\r\nuntil the play was over. At a Japanese playhouse, however, a portion\r\nof the audience may be disposed to go home at some stage of the\r\nproceedings and return later. The careful manager of a small theatre\r\nidentifies these patrons by impressing a small stamp on the palms of\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nFrom the theatre we went to the travelling shows. They charged 2 sen.\r\nWe were shown a mermaid, peepshows, a snake, an unhappy bear, three\r\ndoleful monkeys and some stuffed animals which may or may not have had\r\nin life an uncommon number of legs. There was a barefaced imposture by\r\na young and pretty show-woman who insisted that two marmots in her lap\r\nwere the offspring of a girl. \"Look,\" she cried, \"at two sisters, the\r\ndaughters of one mother. See their hands!\" And she held up their paws.\r\nShe rounded off the fraud by feeding the creatures with condensed\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nAs I returned to the inn from these Elizabethan scenes I noticed that\r\nI was preceded in the crowd by a spectacled policeman who carried a\r\npaper lantern. Although, as I have explained, the stage plays given in\r\nthe street were continued all night, only one arrest was made. The\r\nprisoner was a drunkard who proved to be a medicine seller but\r\ndescribed himself as a journalist. I went to see the clean wooden cell\r\nwhere topers are confined until they are sober. It had a very low\r\ndoor, so that culprits might be compelled to enter and leave humbly on\r\ntheir knees.\r\n\r\nWe had begun our festival day at six in the morning by attending a\r\ncelebration at the Shinto shrine. \"Although it is no longer necessary,\r\nperhaps, to attend the ceremony in a special kind of _geta_,\" said our\r\nlandlady, \"it would be as well if you observed the old rule not to\r\nattend without taking a bath in the early morning.\"[119]\r\n\r\nAt the ancient shrine the townspeople whose turn it was to attend the\r\nannual function had assembled in ceremonial costumes. One man wore his\r\nhair tied up in the fashion of the old prints. The plaintive strains\r\nof old instruments made the strange appeal of all folk music. A\r\ndecorous procession was headed by the piebald pony of the shrine.\r\nYouths and maidens carried aloft tubs of rice, vegetables, fish and\r\n_saké_. These were received by the chief priest. He carefully placed a\r\nstrip of cloth before his mouth and nose[120] and addressed the chief\r\ndeity, all heads being bowed. Then the priest placed the offerings in\r\nthe darkened interior of the shrine. There was a cheery naturalness in\r\nall the proceedings. A few small children in gay holiday dress ran\r\nfreely among the worshippers and encountered indulgent smiles. When an\r\nend had been made of offering food and drink the priest within the\r\nshrine read a second message to the deity. Again all heads were bowed.\r\nHis thin voice was heard in the morning quiet, interrupted only by a\r\nchild's cry, the twittering of birds and the wind rustling the\r\ncryptomeria, dark against the blue of the hills.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony the food and drink which had been brought by the\r\npeople were consumed by the priests and the country folk in a large\r\nroom of the chief priest's house. We were given ceremonial _saké_ to\r\nwhich rice had been added and as mementoes little cakes and dried\r\nfish. Not so long ago the presence of a foreigner would have been\r\nunwelcome at such a ceremony as we had witnessed: the fear of\r\n\"contagion of foreigners\" extended even to people from another\r\nprefecture. To-day the amiable priest placed in our hands for a few\r\nmoments a small Buddha supposed to be six centuries old.\r\n\r\nBefore the festival the priest had observed certain taboos for eight\r\ndays. He had avoided meeting persons in mourning and his food had been\r\ncooked at a specially prepared fire. He had been careful not to touch\r\nother persons, particularly women; he had bathed several times daily\r\nin cold water and he had said many prayers. The heads of the household\r\nin the community whose turn it was to attend at the shrine were also\r\nsupposed to have observed some of the same taboos. Only those persons\r\nmight make offerings at the shrine whose fathers and mothers were\r\nliving.[121] Formerly portions of the offerings of rice and _saké_ at\r\nthe shrine were solemnly given to a young girl.\r\n\r\nIn this district, when we discussed the influences which made for\r\nmoral or non-material improvement, everyone put the school first. Then\r\ncame home training. In this part of the world the Buddhist priest was\r\ntoo often indifferent; the Shinto priest worked at his farm. One\r\nperson well qualified to express an opinion said that a \"wise and\r\nbenevolent\" chief constable could exercise a good moral influence.\r\nOthers believed in public opinion. A policeman said, \"The first thing\r\nis for people to have food and clothes; without such primary\r\nsatisfaction it is very difficult to expect them to be moral.\" In\r\nconsidering the influence of the police and the schoolmaster it is not\r\nwithout interest to remember that a chief of police and the head of a\r\nschool receive about the same salary. Assistant teachers and plain\r\nconstables are also on an equality. I found the salary of the\r\nadministrative head of one county, the _gunchō_, to be only 2,000 yen\r\na year.\r\n\r\nI was told that in the prefecture we were passing through there were\r\nno fewer than 360 co-operative societies. The credit branches had a\r\ncapital of two million yen; the purchase and sale branches showed a\r\nturnover of three million yen. In time of famine, due to too low a\r\ntemperature for the rice or to floods which drown the crop,\r\nco-operation had proved its value. The prefectures north of Tokyo\r\nfacing the Pacific are the chief victims of famine, for near Sendai\r\nthe warm current from the south turns off towards America. I was told\r\nthat the number of persons who actually die as the result of famine\r\nhas been \"exaggerated.\" The number in 1905 was \"not more than a\r\nhundred.\" These unfortunates were infants \"and infirm people who\r\nsuffered from lack of suitable nourishment.\" Every year the\r\ndevelopment of railway and steam communications makes easier the task\r\nof relieving famine sufferers.[122] In the old days people were often\r\nfound dead who had money but were unable to get food for it. As Japan\r\nis a long island with varying climates there is never general\r\nscarcity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] For statistics of railways, see Appendix XXXV.\r\n\r\n[115] The percentage of children \"attending\" school for the whole of\r\nJapan is officially reported in 1918 as: cities, 98.18 per cent.;\r\nvillages, 99.23 per cent.; but this does not mean daily attendance.\r\n\r\n[116] Since 1919 the salaries of elementary school teachers have been\r\nraised to 26, 16 and 15 yen per month, according to grade.\r\n\r\n[117] Only last year (1921) another schoolmaster lost his life in an\r\nendeavour to save the Emperor's portrait from his burning school.\r\n\r\n[118] See Appendix XXXVI.\r\n\r\n[119] A hot bath is ordinarily obtainable only in the afternoon and\r\nevening in most Japanese hotels. In the morning people are content\r\nmerely with rinsing their hands and face.\r\n\r\n[120] In addressing a superior, many Japanese still draw in their\r\nbreath from time to time audibly.\r\n\r\n[121] That is, persons who might be considered not to have failed in\r\ntheir filial duties.\r\n\r\n[122] After the failure of the 1918-19 crop in India, 600,000 persons\r\nwere in receipt of famine relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE DWELLERS IN THE HILLS\r\n(FUKUSHIMA)\r\n\r\nI didn't visit this place in the hope of seeing fine prospects--my study\r\nis man.--BORROW\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I left the town I had a chat with a landowner who turned his\r\ntenants' rent rice into _saké_. He was of the fifth generation of\r\nbrewers. He said that in his childhood drunken men often lay about the\r\nstreet; now, he said, drunken men were only to be seen on festival\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThere had been a remarkable development in the trade in flavoured\r\naerated waters, \"lemonade\" and \"cider champagne\" chiefly. I found\r\nthese beverages on sale in the remotest places, for the Japanese have\r\nthe knack of tying a number of bottles together with rope, which makes\r\nthem easily transportable. The new lager beers, which are advertised\r\neverywhere, have also affected the consumption of _saké_.[123] _Saké_\r\nis usually compared with sherry. It is drunk mulled. At a banquet,\r\nlasting five or six hours or longer, a man \"strong in _saké_\" may\r\nconceivably drink ten _go_ (a _go_ is about one-third of a pint)\r\nbefore achieving drunkenness, but most people would be affected by\r\nthree _go_. Some of the topers who boast of the quantity of _saké_\r\nthey can consume--I have heard of men declaring that they could drink\r\ntwenty _go_--are cheated late in the evening by the waiting-maids. The\r\nlittle _saké_ bottles are opaque, and it is easy to remove them for\r\nrefilling before they are quite empty.\r\n\r\nThe brewer, who was a firm adherent of the Jishu sect of Buddhists,\r\nwas accustomed to burn incense with his family at the domestic shrine\r\nevery morning. But this was not the habit of all the adherents of his\r\ndenomination. As to the moral advancement of the neighbourhood, his\r\ngrandfather \"tried very earnestly to improve the district by means of\r\nreligion, but without result.\" He himself attached most value to\r\neducation and after that to young men's associations.\r\n\r\nAs we left the town we passed a \"woman priest\" who was walking to\r\nNikko, eighty miles away. Portraits of dead people, entrusted to her\r\nby their relatives for conveyance to distant shrines, were hung round\r\nher body.\r\n\r\nAs the route became more and more hilly I realised how accurate is\r\nthat representation of hills in Japanese art which seems odd before\r\none has been in Japan: the landscape stands out as if seen in a flash\r\nof lightning.\r\n\r\nThree things by the way were arresting: the number of shrines, mostly\r\ndedicated to the fox god; the rice suspended round the farm buildings\r\nor drying on racks; and the masses of evening primroses, called in\r\nJapan \"moon-seeing flowers.\"\r\n\r\nA feature of every village was one or more barred wooden sheds\r\ncontaining fire-extinguishing apparatus, often provided and worked by\r\nthe young men's association. Sometimes a piece of ground was described\r\nto me as \"the training ground of the fire defenders.\" The night\r\npatrols of the village were young fellows chosen in turn by the\r\nconstable from the fire-prevention parties, made up by the youths of\r\nthe village. There stood up in every village a high perpendicular\r\nladder with a bell or wooden clapper at the top to give the alarm. The\r\nemblem of the fire brigade, a pole with white paper streamers\r\nattached, was sometimes distinguished by a yellow paper streamer\r\nawarded by the prefecture.\r\n\r\nOn a sweltering July day it was difficult to realise that the villages\r\nwe passed through, now half hidden in foliage, might be under 7 ft. of\r\nsnow in winter. In travelling in this hillier region one has an extra\r\n_kurumaya_, who pushes behind or acts as brakeman.\r\n\r\nAt the \"place of the seven peaks\" we found a stone dedicated to the\r\nworship of the stars which form the Plough. Again and again I noticed\r\nshrines which had before them two tall trees, one larger than the\r\nother, called \"man and wife.\" It was explained to me that \"there\r\ncannot be a more sacred place than where husband and wife stand\r\ntogether.\" A small tract of cryptomeria on the lower slopes of a hill\r\nbelonged to the school. The children had planted it in honour of the\r\nmarriage of the Emperor when he was Crown Prince.\r\n\r\nOften the burial-grounds, the stones of which are seldom more than\r\nabout 2 ft. high by 6 ins. wide, are on narrow strips of roadside\r\nwaste. (The coffin is commonly square, and the body is placed in it in\r\nthe kneeling position so often assumed in life.) Here, as elsewhere,\r\nthere seemed to be rice fields in every spot where rice fields could\r\npossibly be made.\r\n\r\nOn approaching a village the traveller is flattered by receiving the\r\nbows of small girls and boys who range themselves in threes and fours\r\nto perform their act of courtesy. I was told that the children are\r\ntaught at school to bow to foreigners. I remember that in the remoter\r\nvillages of Holland the stranger also received the bows of young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn the house of the headman of one village were displayed charms for\r\nprotection from fire, theft and epidemic. We spoke of weather signs,\r\nand he quoted a proverb, \"Never rely on the glory of the morning or on\r\nthe smile of your mother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nWe had before us a week's travel by _kuruma_. Otherwise we should have\r\nliked to have brought away specimens of the wooden utensils of some of\r\nthe villages. The travelling woodworker whom we often encountered--he\r\nhas to travel about in order to reach new sources of wood supply--has\r\nbeen despised because of his unsettled habits, but I was told that\r\nthere was a special deity to look after him. In the town we had left\r\nthere was delightful woodwork, but most of the draper's stuff was\r\npitiful trash made after what was supposed to be foreign fashions. I\r\nmay also mention the large collection of blood-and-thunder stories\r\nupon Western models which were piled up in the stationers' shops.\r\n\r\nAs we walked up into the hills--the _kuruma_ men were sent by an\r\neasier route--we passed plenty of sweet chestnuts and saw large\r\nmasses of blue single hydrangea and white and pink spirea. We came on\r\nthe ruined huts of those who had burnt a bit of hillside and taken\r\nfrom it a few crops of buckwheat. The charred trunks of trees stood up\r\namong the green undergrowth that had invaded the patches. There was a\r\ngreat deal of plantain and a _kurumaya_ mentioned that sometimes when\r\nchildren found a dead frog they buried it in leaves of that plant.\r\nJapanese children are also in the habit of angling for frogs with a\r\npiece of plantain. The frogs seize the plantain and are jerked ashore.\r\n\r\nWe took our lunch on a hill top. It had been a stiff climb and we\r\nmarvelled at the expense to which a poor county must be put for the\r\nmaintenance of roads which so often hang on cliff sides or span\r\ntorrents. The great piles of wood accumulated at the summit turned the\r\ntalk to \"silent trade.\" In \"silent trade\" people on one side of a hill\r\ntraded with people on the other side without meeting. The products\r\nwere taken to the hill top and left there, usually in a rough shed\r\nbuilt to protect the goods from rain. The exchange might be on the\r\nprinciple of barter or of cash payment. But the amount of goods given\r\nin exchange or the cash payment made was left to honour. \"Silent\r\ntrade\" still continues in certain parts of Japan. Sometimes the price\r\nexpected for goods is written up in the shed. \"Silent trade\"\r\noriginated because of fears of infectious disease; it survives because\r\nit is more convenient for one who has goods to sell or to buy to\r\ntravel up and down one side of a mountain than up and down two sides.\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded on our way we were once more struck by the\r\nextraordinary wealth of wood. Here is a country where every household\r\nis burning wood and charcoal daily, a country where not only the\r\nhouses but most of the things in common use are made of wood; and\r\nthere seems to be no end to the trees that remain. It is little wonder\r\nthat in many parts there has been and is improvident use of wood.\r\nHappily every year the regulation of timber areas and wise planting\r\nmake progress. But for many square miles of hillside I saw there is no\r\nfitting word but jungle.\r\n\r\nAt the small ramshackle hot-spring inns of the remote hills the\r\nguests are mostly country folk. Many of them carefully bring their own\r\nrice and _miso_, and are put up at a cost of about 10 sen a day. In\r\nthe passage ways one finds rough boxes about 4 ft. square full of wood\r\nash in the centre of which charcoal may be burned and kettles boiled.\r\n\r\nWe were in a region where there is snow from the middle of November to\r\nthe middle of April. For two-thirds of December and January the snow\r\nis never less than 2 ft. deep. The attendance of the children at one\r\nschool during the winter was 95 per cent. for boys and 90 per cent.\r\nfor girls. (See note, p. 112.)\r\n\r\nMy _kurumaya_ pointed to a mountain top where, he said, there were\r\nnearly three acres of beautiful flowers. The rice fields in the hills\r\nwere suffering from lack of water and a deputation of villagers had\r\ngone ten miles into the mountains to pray for rain. It is wonderful at\r\nwhat altitudes rice fields are contrived. I noted some at 2,500 ft. In\r\nlooking down from a place where the cliff road hung out over the river\r\nthat flowed a hundred feet below I noticed a stone image lying on its\r\nback in the water. It may have come there by accident, but the ducking\r\nof such a figure in order to procure rain is not unknown.\r\n\r\nAt an inn I asked one of the greybeards who courteously visited us if\r\nthere would be much competition for his seat when he retired from the\r\nvillage assembly. He thought that there would be several candidates.\r\nIn the town from which we had set out on our journey through the\r\nhighlands a doctor had spent 500 yen in trying to get on the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe tea at this resting place was poor and someone quoted the proverb,\r\n\"Even the devil was once eighteen and bad tea has its tolerable first\r\ncup.\" On going to the village office I found that for a population of\r\n2,000 there were, in addition to the village shrine, sixteen other\r\nshrines and three Buddhist temples. Against fire there were four fire\r\npumps and 155 \"fire defenders.\" A dozen of the young men of the\r\nvillage were serving in the army, four were home on furlough, six were\r\ninvalided and forty were of the reserve. As many as thirty-seven had\r\nmedals. The doctors were two in number and the midwives three. There\r\nwas a sanitary committee of twenty-three members. The revenue of the\r\nvillage was 5,740 yen. It had a fund of 740 yen \"against time of\r\nfamine.\" The taxes paid were 2,330 yen for State tax, 2,460 yen for\r\nprefectural tax and 4,350 yen for village tax. The village possessed\r\ntwo co-operative societies, a young men's association, a Buddhist\r\nyoung men's association, a Buddhist young women's association, a\r\nsociety for the development of knowledge, a society of the graduates\r\nof the primary school, two thrift organisations, a society for\r\n\"promoting knowledge and virtue,\" and an association the members of\r\nwhich \"aimed at becoming distinguished.\" There were in the village\r\nninety subscribers to the Red Cross and two dozen members of the\r\nnational Patriotic Women's Association.\r\n\r\nIn the county through which we were moving there was gold, silver and\r\ncopper mining.[124] Out of its population of 36,000 only 632 were\r\nentitled to vote for an M.P.\r\n\r\nWe rested at a school where the motto was, \"Even in this good reign I\r\npray because I wish to make our country more glorious.\" There were\r\nportraits of four deceased local celebrities and of Peter the Great,\r\nFranklin, Lincoln, Commander Perry and Bismarck. Illustrated wall\r\ncharts showed how to sit on a school seat, how to identify poisonous\r\nplants and how to conform to the requirements of etiquette. The\r\nfollowing admonitions were also displayed--a copy of them is given to\r\neach child, who is expected to read the twelve counsels every morning\r\nbefore coming to school:\r\n\r\n  1.--Do your own work and don't rely on others to do it.\r\n\r\n  2.--Be ardent when you learn or play.\r\n\r\n  3.--Endeavour to do away with your bad habits and cultivate good ones.\r\n\r\n  4.--Never tell a lie and be careful when you speak.\r\n\r\n  5.--Do what you think right in your heart and at the same time have\r\n  good manners.\r\n\r\n  6.--Overcome difficulties and never hold back from hard work.\r\n\r\n  7.--Do not make appointments which you are uncertain to keep.\r\n\r\n  8.--Do not carelessly lend or borrow.\r\n\r\n  9.--Do not pass by another's difficulties and do not give another\r\n  much trouble.\r\n\r\n  10.--Be careful about things belonging to the public as well as\r\n  about things belonging to yourself.\r\n\r\n  11.--Keep the outside and inside of the school clean and also\r\n  take care of waste paper.\r\n\r\n  12.--Never play with a grumbling spirit.\r\n\r\nThere was stuck on the roofs of many houses a rod with a piece of\r\nwhite paper attached, a charm against fire. One house so provided was\r\nnext door to the fire station. Frequently we passed a children's\r\n_jizō_ or Buddha, comically decked in the hat and miscellaneous\r\ngarments of youngsters whose grateful mothers believed them to have\r\nbeen cured by the power of the deity.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of clothes, it was the hottest July weather and the natural\r\ngarment was at most a loin cloth. The women wore a piece of red or\r\ncoloured cotton from their waist to their knees. The backs of the men\r\nand women who were working in the open were protected by a flapping\r\nricestraw mat or by an armful of green stuff. The boys under ten or so\r\nwere naked and so were many little girls. But the influence of the\r\nWesternising period ideas of what was \"decent\" in the presence of\r\nforeigners survives. So, whenever a policeman was near, people of all\r\nages were to be seen huddling on their kimonos. I was sorry for a\r\nmerry group of boys and girls aged 12 or 13 who in that torrid\r\nweather[125] were bathing at an ideal spot in the river and suddenly\r\ncaught sight of a policeman. It is deplorable that a consciousness of\r\nnakedness should be cultivated when nakedness is natural, traditional\r\nand hygienic. (Even in the schools the girls are taught to make their\r\nkimonos meet at the neck--with a pin![126]--much higher than they used\r\nto be worn.) It is only fair to bear in mind, however, that some\r\nhurrying on of clothes by villagers is done out of respect to the\r\npassing superior, before whom it is impolite to appear without\r\npermission half dressed or wearing other than the usual clothing.\r\n\r\nAt a hot spring we found many patrons because, as I was told, \"Ox-day\r\nis very suitable for bathing.\" The old pre-Meiji days of the week were\r\ntwelve: Rat-, Ox-, Tiger-, Hare-, Dragon-, Snake-, Horse-, Sheep-,\r\nMonkey-, Fowl-, Dog-and Boar-day. When the Western seven days of the\r\nweek were adopted they were rendered into Japanese as: Sun, Moon,\r\nFire, Water, Wood, Metal and Earth, followed by the word meaning star\r\nor planet and day. For instance, Sunday is _Nichi_ (Sun) _yo_ (star)\r\n_bi_ (day), and Monday, _Getsu_ (Moon) _yo_ (planet) _bi_ (day), or\r\n_Nichi-yo-bi_ and _Getsu-yo-bi_. For brevity the _bi_ is often dropped\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe headman of a village we passed through told me that the occasion\r\nof my coming was the first on which English had been heard in those\r\nparts. Talking about the people of his village, he said that there had\r\nbeen four divorces in the year. Once in four or five years a child was\r\nborn within a few months of marriage. In the whole county there had\r\nbeen among 310 young men examined for the army only four cases of\r\n\"disgraceful disease.\" There was no immoral woman in the 75-miles-long\r\nvalley. Elsewhere in the county many young men were in debt, but in\r\nthe headman's village no youth was without a savings-bank book. And\r\nthe local men-folk \"did not use women's savings as in some places.\"\r\n\r\nOne shrine we passed seemed to be dedicated to the moon. Another was\r\nintended to propitiate the horsefly. Several villages had boxes\r\nfastened on posts for the reception of broken glass. As we approached\r\none village I saw an inscription put up by the young men's\r\nassociation, \"Good Crops and Prosperity to the Village.\" When we came\r\nto the next village the schoolmaster was responsible for an\r\ninscription, \"Peace to the World and Safety to the State.\" In other\r\nplaces I found young men's society notice boards giving information\r\nabout the area of land in a village, how it was cropped, the kind of\r\ncrops, the area of forest, lists of famous places, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOVABLE STAGE AT A FESTIVAL FIFTY MILES FROM A RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMHOUSE AT WHICH MR. UCHIMURA PREACHED.]\r\n\r\nIn the gorges we rode over many suspension bridges and crossed the\r\nbackbone of Japan in unforgettable scenes of romantic beauty. From\r\nthe craggy paths of our highlands, amid a wealth not only of gorgeous\r\nflowers and greenery but of great velvety butterflies, we saw the\r\nfar-off snow-clad Japanese Alps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TENANT FARMERS' HOUSES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTHOR AT THE \"SPIRIT MEETING.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME PERFORMERS AT THE \"SPIRIT MEETING.\"]\r\n\r\nAt one of the schools where we lunched I noticed that the large wall\r\nmaps were of Siam and Malaya, Borneo, Australia and China (two). The\r\nportraits were of Florence Nightingale, Lincoln, Napoleon and Christ\r\nas the Good Shepherd, the last named being \"a present from a believer\r\nfriend of the schoolmaster.\"[127] This school closed at noon from July\r\n10 to July 31, and had twenty days' vacation in August and another\r\ntwenty days in the rice-planting and busy sericultural season. The\r\nsewing-room of the school was used in winter as a dormitory for boys\r\nwho lived at a distance. Accommodation for girls was provided in the\r\nvillage. The children brought their rice with them. The products of\r\nthe school farm were also eaten by the boarding pupils. It was\r\nestimated that the cost of maintaining the girls was 10 sen a day.\r\nThree-fourths of this expense was borne by the village. The regularity\r\nand strictness of the dormitory management were found to have an\r\nexcellent effect. At the winter school, an adjunct of the day school,\r\nthere was an attendance of a score of youths and sixty girls.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of a place where we stayed for the night, one who had a wide\r\nknowledge of rural Japan said that he did not think that there was a\r\nlonelier spot where farming was carried on. There was no market or\r\nfair for 80 or 90 miles and the little groups of houses were 2 or 3\r\nmiles apart. In this district, it was explained, \"the rich are not so\r\nrich and the poor are not so poor.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed somewhere a fine shrine for the welfare of horses. At a\r\ncertain festival hundreds of horses are driven down there to gallop\r\nround and round the sacred buildings. Thousands of people attend this\r\nfestival, but it was declared that no one was ever hurt by the horses.\r\n\r\nThe poetical names of country inns would make an interesting\r\ncollection. I remember that it was at \"the inn of cold spring water\"\r\nthat the waiting-maid had never seen cow's milk. She proved to be the\r\ndaughter of the host and wore a gold ring by way of marking the fact.\r\nThis girl told us that on the banks of the river there was only one\r\nhouse in 70 miles. The village was having the usual holiday to\r\ncelebrate the end of the toilsome sericultural season.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the next village we met two far-travelled young women\r\nselling the dried seaweed which, in many varieties, figures in the\r\nJapanese dietary.[128] (There are shops which sell nothing but\r\nprepared seaweeds.) A notice board there informed us that the road was\r\nmaintained at the cost of the local young men's society. As we were on\r\nfoot we felt grateful, for the road was well kept. We passed for miles\r\nover planking hung on the cliff side or on roadway carried on\r\nembankments. On the suspended pathways there was now and then a plank\r\nloose or broken, and there was no rail between the pedestrian and the\r\ntorrent dashing below. Where there was embanked roadway it was almost\r\nalways uphill and downhill and it frequently swung sharply round the\r\ncorner of a cliff. As the river increased in volume we saw many rafts\r\nof timber shooting the rapids. At one place twenty-six raftsmen had\r\nbeen drowned. The remnants of two bridges showed the force of the\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nIn this region the _kurumaya_ were hard put to it at times and once a\r\n_kuruma_ broke down. Its owner cheerfully detached its broken axle and\r\nwent off with it at a trot ten miles or so to a blacksmith. Later he\r\ntraversed the ten miles once more to refit his _kuruma_, afterwards\r\ncoming on fifteen more miles to our inn. The endurance and cheeriness\r\nof the _kurumaya_ were surprising. It was usually in face of their\r\nprotests that we got out to ease them while going uphill. Every\r\nmorning they wanted to arrange to go farther than we thought\r\nreasonable. Each man had not only his passenger but his passenger's\r\nheavy bag. One day we did thirty-six miles over rough roads. The\r\n_kurumaya_ proposed to cover fifty. They showed spirit, good nature\r\nand loyalty. The character of their conversation is worth mentioning.\r\nAt one point they were discussing the plays we had witnessed, at other\r\ntimes the scenery, local legends, the best routes and the crops,\r\nmaterial condition and disposition of the villagers. Our _kurumaya_\r\ncompared very favourably indeed with men of an equal social class at\r\nhome. Their manners were perfect. They stayed at the same inns as we\r\ndid--once in the next room--and behaved admirably. Every evening the\r\nmen washed their white cotton shorts and jackets--their whole costume\r\nexcept for a wide-brimmed sun hat and straw _waraji_. Tied to the axle\r\nof each _kuruma_ were several pairs of _waraji_, for on the rough hill\r\nroads this simple form of footgear soon wears out. Discarded _waraji_\r\nare to be seen on every roadside in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions on some of the wayside stones we passed had been\r\nwritten by priests so ignorant that the wording was either ridiculous\r\nor almost without meaning. But there was no difficulty in deciphering\r\nan inscription on a stone which declared that it had been erected by a\r\ncompany of Buddhists who claimed to have repeated the holy name of\r\nAmida 2,000,000 times. (The idea is that salvation may be obtained by\r\nthe repetition of the phrase _Namu Amida Butsu_.) A small stone set up\r\non a rock in the middle of paddy fields intimated that at that spot\r\n\"people gathered to see the moon one night every month.\" A third stone\r\nwas dedicated to the monkey as the messenger of a certain god, just as\r\nthe fox is regarded as the messenger of Inari.\r\n\r\nWe saw during our journey large numbers of _kiri_ (Paulownia) used for\r\nmaking _geta_ and bride's chests. Some farmers seem to plant _kiri_\r\ntrees at the birth of a daughter so as to have wood for her wedding\r\nchest or money for her outfit[129]. _Kiri_ seems to be increasingly\r\ngrown. On the other hand in the same districts lacquer trees were now\r\nseldom planted. The farmers complained that they were cheated by the\r\ncollectors of lacquer who come round to cut the trees. The age of\r\ncutting was given me as the eighth or ninth year, but poor farmers\r\nsometimes allowed a young tree to be cut. A tree may be cut once a\r\nyear for three or four years. After that it is useless even for fuel,\r\nowing to the smell it gives off, and is often left standing. The old\r\nscarred trunks, sometimes headless, suggested the tattooed faces and\r\nbodies of Maori veterans. As lacquer is poisonous to the skin the wood\r\ncalls for careful handling. I saw one of the itinerant lacquer\r\ncollectors, his hands wrapped in cotton, operating on a tree.\r\n\r\nDuring a particularly hot run we had the good fortune to come on a\r\nsoda-water spring from which we all drank freely. A factory erected to\r\ntap the spring was in ruins. Evidently the cost of carriage was\r\nprohibitive.\r\n\r\nIn these hills the rice was planted farther apart than is usual so\r\nthat the sun might warm the water. Here as elsewhere _daikon_ were\r\nhung up to dry on walls and trees, and looked like giant tallow\r\ncandles. Below a bridge, which marked the village boundary, flags had\r\nbeen flung down by way of keeping off epidemics. Evil spirits were\r\nwarded off by special dances.\r\n\r\nThe porch of a little tea-house where we rested was covered with\r\ngrapes. Soon after leaving it we reached our destination for the\r\nnight, a small town of houses of several storeys which clustered on a\r\nhillside under the shadow of a Zen temple. Meat and eggs were\r\nforbidden to the town, but as the residents were all Zen Buddhists the\r\nrestriction was no hardship. There was no cow in the place, but\r\ncondensed milk was allowed. A man at the inn told me that he knew of\r\nten Shinto shrines which forbade the use of chickens and eggs in their\r\nlocalities. The view from the temple, perched high on its rock above\r\nthe wide riverway, was exceptionally fine. Parties of boys and girls\r\nof thirteen paid visits to this temple \"because thirteen is known as a\r\nperilous age.\" The people of the vegetarian town, instead of feeding\r\non the fish in the river, fed them. I saw a shoal of fish being given\r\nscraps at the water edge.\r\n\r\nAs we went on our way and spoke of the bad roads it was suggested that\r\nin the old days roads were purposely left uphill and downhill in order\r\nthat the advance of enemies might be hindered. We came to a\r\ndilapidated tea-house kept by an ugly old woman who showed a touching\r\nfondness for a cat and a dog. From her shack we had a view of a\r\nvolcano which had destroyed two villages a few years before. Our\r\nhostess, who made much of us, said that the catastrophe had been\r\npreceded by \"horrible da-da-da-bang\" sounds and lightnings, and that\r\nit was accompanied by \"thunderbolts and heavy thick smoke.\" The old\r\nwoman had beheld \"soil boiling and cracking.\"\r\n\r\nAlong our route we had more evidences of \"fire farming.\" The procedure\r\nwas to sow buckwheat the first year and rape and millet the second\r\nyear. In the cryptomeria forests there was a variety which, when cut,\r\nsprouts from the ground and makes a new growth like an elm. One crop\r\nwe saw was ginseng, protected by low structures covered by matting.\r\n\r\nAt length we heard the distant sound of a locomotive whistle. We were\r\napproaching the newly opened railway which was to take us the short\r\nrun to the sea. Soon we were in a rather unkempt village which had\r\nhardly recovered from its surprise at finding that it had a railway\r\nstation. We paid our _kurumaya_ the sum contracted for and something\r\nover for their faithful service and for their long return run, and\r\nhaving exchanged bows and cordial greetings, we left for a time the\r\nglorified perambulators which a foreign missionary is supposed to have\r\nintroduced half a century ago. (The Japanese claim the honour of\r\n\"inventing\" the jinrikisha.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[123] See Appendix XXXVII.\r\n\r\n[124] See Appendix XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n[125] In Tokyo one may sleep night after night in summer with no\r\ncovering but the thinnest loose cotton kimono and have an electric fan\r\ngoing within the mosquito curtain, and still feel the heat.\r\n\r\n[126] The kimono has no button, hook, tie, or fastening of any kind,\r\nand is kept in place by the waist string and _obi_.\r\n\r\n[127] It is an illustration of the difficulty of using a foreign\r\nsymbolism that it is unlikely that a single child in the school had\r\never seen a shepherd or a sheep.\r\n\r\n[128] In 1918 the value of seaweed was returned at 13,600,000 yen.\r\n\r\n[129] In fifteen years a _kiri_ tree may be about 20 ft. high and 3\r\nft. in circumference and be worth 30 yen. _Kiri_ trees to the value of\r\n3 million yen were felled in 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSHRINES AND POETRY\r\n\r\n(NIIGATA AND TOYAMA)\r\n\r\nSir, I am talking of the mass of the people.--JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railway made its way through snow stockades and through many\r\ntunnels which pierced cryptomeria-clad hills. Eventually we descended\r\nto the wonderful Kambara plains, a sea of emerald rice. Fourteen\r\nmillion bushels of rice are produced on the flats of Niigata\r\nprefecture, which grows more rice than any other. The rice, grown\r\nunder 800 different names, is officially graded into half a dozen\r\nqualities. The problem of the high country we had come from was how to\r\nkeep its paddy fields from drying up; the problem of Niigata is\r\nchiefly to keep the water in its fields at a sufficiently low level.\r\nAlmost every available square yard of the prefecture is paddy.\r\n\r\nAt Gosen there were depressing-looking weaving sheds, but the Black\r\nCountry created by the oil fields farther on was in even more striking\r\ncontrast with the beautiful region we had left. The petroleum yield\r\nwas 65 million gallons, and the smell of the oil went with us to the\r\ncapital city.\r\n\r\nNiigata has a dark reputation for exporting farmers' daughters to\r\nother parts of Japan, but I have also heard that the percentage of\r\nattendance made by the children at the primary schools of the\r\nprefecture is higher than anywhere else. Like Amsterdam, Niigata is a\r\ncity of bridges. There must be 200 of them. The big timber bridge\r\nacross the estuary is nearly half a mile long. One finds in Niigata a\r\nManchester-like spirit of business enterprise. Our hotel was\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nBecause they speak with all sorts of people and hear a great deal of\r\nconversation the blind _amma_ are full of interesting gossip. A clever\r\n_amma_ who ran his knuckles up and down my back said that farm land a\r\ngood way from Niigata was sold at from 200 yen to 300 yen and\r\nsometimes at 400 yen per quarter acre.[130] Prefectural officials who\r\ncalled on me explained that drainage operations on a large scale were\r\nbeing completed. The water of which the low land was relieved would be\r\nused to extend farming in the hills. An effort was also being made to\r\ndevelop stock-keeping in the uplands. It was proposed \"to supply every\r\nfarmer with a scheme for increasing his live stock.\" The optimistic\r\nauthorities were particularly attracted by the notion of keeping\r\nsheep. The plan was to arrange for co-operation in hill pasturing and\r\nin wool and meat production. Mutton was as yet unknown, however, in\r\nNiigata. (The mutton eaten by foreigners in Japan usually comes from\r\nShanghai.)\r\n\r\nI went into the country to a little place where the natural gas from\r\nthe soil was used by the farmers for lighting and cooking. I heard\r\ntalk in this village and in others of the influence of the local army\r\nreservists' society. \"Young men on returning from their army service\r\nare always influential. They are much respected by the youths and are\r\ntalkative indeed in the village assembly.\"\r\n\r\nAs our host was the village headman he kindly brought the assembly\r\ntogether to meet me. I asked the assembled fathers about two stones\r\nerected in the village. Somebody had kindled a fire of rice screenings\r\nnear one of them and it had been scorched. On the other stone a kimono\r\nhad been hung to dry. The explanation was that the stones were\r\nmonuments not shrines, and that the people who had set them up had\r\nleft the district. The stones were no doubt respected while the donors\r\nlived. It was not uncommon for a pilgrim to a shrine to erect a\r\nmemorial on his return home.\r\n\r\nIn this village fifty Shinto shrines of the fifth class had been\r\nclosed under the influence of the Home Office. They were shrines which\r\nhad no offering from the village to support them. They had only a few\r\nworshippers. All the remaining shrines were of the fifth class but\r\none, and it was of the fourth class. In the county there was a\r\nsecond-class shrine and in the whole prefecture there were two or\r\nthree first-class shrines. The villagers had agreed among themselves\r\nwhich of their own shrines should be made an end of. A shrine which\r\nwas dispensed with was burnt. The stone steps approaching it were also\r\nremoved. Burning was not sacrilege but purification. On the closing of\r\na shrine there might be complaints on the part of some old man or\r\nwoman, but the majority of people approved. One Shinto shrine guardian\r\nlived at the fourth-class shrine and conducted a ceremony at the\r\nsixteen fifth-class shrines. Of the twenty Buddhist temples in the\r\nvillage (300 families cultivating an average of a _chō_ apiece),\r\ntwelve were Hokke, five Shingon, two Shinshu and one Zen. All the\r\npriests were married.[131]\r\n\r\nI have used the phrase \"Buddhist temple\" loosely and may do so again,\r\nfor it conveys an idea which \"Buddhist church\" does not. A temple\r\n(_dō_) is properly an edifice in which a Buddha is enshrined. This\r\nbuilding is not for services or burial ceremonies or anniversary\r\nofferings for departed souls. It may or may not have a guardian\r\n(_domori_). He is never a priest with a shaven head. A Buddhist church\r\n(_tera_) is a place where adherents go as anniversaries come round or\r\nfor sermons. It possesses a priest. There is a considerable difference\r\nin the style of Buddhist edifices according to their denomination--Zen\r\nbuildings are particularly plain--but all are more elaborate than\r\nShinto shrines.\r\n\r\nA large Shinto shrine is called _yashiro_ (house of god); a small one\r\n_hokora_. A _hokora_ is transportable. Originally it was and in some\r\nplaces it still is a perishable wooden shrine thatched with reed or\r\ngrass straw which is renewed at the spring and autumn festivals. It\r\nmay be less than two feet high and may be made of stone or wood. But\r\nit cannot be regarded as a building. Inside there are _gohei_ (upright\r\nsticks with paper streamers). In a rich man's house a _hokora_ may be\r\nseven or eight feet high or bigger than the smallest _yashiro_, and\r\nmay be embellished with colour and metal.\r\n\r\nReturning to Buddhism, if a priest has a son he may be succeeded by\r\nhim. But many Buddhist priests marry late and have no children. Or\r\ntheir children do not want to be priests. So the priest adopts a\r\nsuccessor. Sometimes he maintains an orphan as acolyte or coadjutor.\r\nDuring the day this assistant goes to school. In the evenings and\r\nduring holidays he is taught to become a priest. When the\r\nprimary-school education is finished the lad may be sent by his\r\npatron, if he is well enough off, to a school of his sect at Kyoto or\r\nTokyo.\r\n\r\nMy travelling companion spoke of the infiltration of new ideas in town\r\nand country. \"A mixing is taking place in the heart and head of\r\neverybody who is not a bigot. But I don't know that some kinds of\r\nChristianity are to do much for us. I heard the other day of a\r\nJapanese Presbyterian who was preaching with zest about hell fire.\r\nGenerally speaking, our old men are looking to the past and our young\r\nmen are aspiring, but not all. Some are content if they can live\r\nuncriticised by their neighbours. When they become old they may begin\r\nto think of a future life and visit temples. But as young men their\r\nthoughts are fully occupied by things of this world.\"\r\n\r\nIn the office of the headman whom I mentioned a page or so back, there\r\nwas behind his chair a _kakemono_ which read, \"Reflecting and\r\nExamining One's Inner Spirit.\" We passed a night in the old house of\r\nthis headman, who was a poet and a country gentleman of a delightful\r\ntype. Being an eldest son he had married young, and his relations with\r\nhis eldest boy, a frank and clever lad, were pleasant to see. The\r\ngarden, instead of being shut in by a wall with a tiled coping or by a\r\npalisade of bamboo stems in the ordinary way, was open towards the\r\nrice fields, a scene of restful beauty. As our _kuruma_ drew near the\r\nhouse, the steward appeared, a broom in his hand. Running for a short\r\ndistance before us until we entered the courtyard, he symbolically\r\nswept the ground according to old custom. After a delightful hot bath\r\nand an elaborate supper, which my fellow traveller afterwards assured\r\nme had meant a week's work for the women of the household--snapping\r\nturtle and choice bamboo shoots were among the honourable dishes--we\r\ngathered at the open side of the room overlooking the garden.\r\nFireflies glowed in the paddies and in the garden two stone lanterns\r\nhad been lighted. One of them, which had a crescent-shaped opening cut\r\nin it, gleamed like the moon; the other, which had a small serrated\r\nopening, represented a star.\r\n\r\nI paid a visit to the local agricultural co-operative store which did\r\nbusiness under the motto, \"Faith is the Mother of all Virtue.\" More\r\nthan half the money taken at the store was for artificial manures.\r\nNext came purchases of imported rice, for, like the Danish peasants\r\nwho export their butter and eat margarine, the local peasants sold\r\ntheir own rice and bought the Saigon variety. The society sold in a\r\nyear a considerable quantity of _saké_. Stretched over the doorway of\r\nthe building in which the goods of the society were stored were the\r\nrope and paper streamers which are seen before Shinto shrines and\r\nconsecrated places. The society had a large flag post for weather\r\nsignals, a white flag for a fine day, a red one for cloudy weather and\r\na blue one for rain.\r\n\r\nI brought away from this village a calendar of agricultural operations\r\nwith poems or mottoes for each month, in the collection of which I\r\nsuspect the poet had a hand:\r\n\r\n_January_: Future of the day determined in the morning.\r\n\r\n_February_: The voice of one reading a farming book coming\r\n  from the snow-covered window.\r\n\r\n_March_: Grafting these young trees, thinking of the days\r\n  of my grandchildren.\r\n\r\n_April_: Digging the soil of the paddy field, sincerity\r\n  concentrated on the edge of the mattock.\r\n\r\n_May_: Returning home with the dim moonlight glinting\r\n  on the edges of our mattocks.\r\n\r\n_June_: Boundless wealth stored up by gracious heaven:\r\n  dig it out with your mattock, take it away with your\r\n  sickle.\r\n\r\n_July_: Weeding the paddy field[132] in a happiness and\r\n  contentment which townspeople do not know.\r\n\r\n_August_: Standing peasant worthier than resting rich man.\r\n\r\n_September_: Ears of rice bend their heads as they ripen.\r\n  (An allusion to wisdom and meekness.)\r\n\r\n_October_: White steam coming out of a manure house on\r\n an autumn morning.\r\n\r\n_November_: Moon clear and bright above neatly divided\r\n  paddy fields.\r\n\r\n_December_: All the members of the family smiling and\r\n  celebrating the year's end, piling up many bales of rice.\r\n\r\nIn this district I first noticed cotton. It is sown in June and is\r\npicked from time to time between early September and early November.\r\nCotton has been grown for centuries in Japan, but nowadays it is\r\nproduced for household weaving only, the needs of the factories being\r\nmet by foreign imports. The plant has a beautiful yellow flower with a\r\ndark brown eye.\r\n\r\nIn one village I asked how many people smoked. The answer was 60 per\r\ncent. of the men and 10 per cent. of the women. In the same village,\r\nwhich did not seem particularly well off, I was told that 200 daily\r\npapers might be taken among 1,300 families. Eighty per cent. of the\r\nlocal papers were dailies and cost 35 sen a month. Tokyo papers cost\r\n45 or 50 sen a month.\r\n\r\nI visited a school, half of which was in a building adjoining a temple\r\nand half in the temple itself. In the same county there were two other\r\nschools housed in temples. The small Shinto shrine in this temple held\r\nthe Imperial Rescript on education. On one side of it was an ugly\r\nAmerican clock and on the other a thermometer. In the temple (Zen) two\r\nTokyo University students were staying in ideal conditions for\r\nvacation study.\r\n\r\nI saw at one place a very tired, unslept-looking peasant with a small\r\nclosed tub carried over his shoulder by means of a pole. On the tub\r\nwas tied a white streamer, such as is supplied at a Shinto shrine, and\r\na branch of _sakaki_ (_Eurya ochnacea_, the sacred tree). The\r\ntraveller was the delegate of his village. He had been to a mountain\r\nshrine in the next prefecture and the tub held the water he had got\r\nthere. The idea is that if he succeeds in making the journey home\r\nwithout stopping anywhere his efforts will result in rain coming down\r\nat his village. If he should stop at any place to rest or sleep, and\r\nthere should be the slightest drip from his tub there, then the rain\r\nwill be procured not for his own village but for the community in\r\nwhich he has tarried. So our voyager had walked not only for a whole\r\nday but through the night. I heard of a rain delegate who had stamina\r\nenough to keep walking for three or four days without sleeping.\r\n\r\nAnother way of obtaining rain has principally to do with tugging at a\r\nrock with a straw rope. Then there is the plan already referred to of\r\ntying straw ropes to a stone image and flinging it into the river,\r\nsaying, \"If you don't give us rain you will stay there; if you do give\r\nus rain you shall come out.\" There is also the method of paying\r\nsomeone liberally to throw the split open head of an ox into the deep\r\npool of a waterfall. \"Then the water god being much angry,\" said my\r\ninformant, \"he send his dragon to that village, so storm and rain come\r\nnecessarily.\" Yet another plan is for the villagers simply to ascend\r\nto a particular mountain top crying, \"Give us rain! Give us rain!\"\r\nWhile dealing with these magic arts I may reproduce the following\r\nrendering of a printed \"fortune\" which I received from a rural shrine:\r\n\"Wish to agree but now somewhat difficult. Wait patiently for a while.\r\nDo nothing wrong. Wait for the spring to come. Everything will be\r\ncompleted and will become better. Endeavouring to accomplish it soon\r\nwill be fruitless.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a student of agricultural conditions, in Toyama who gossiped to\r\nme of the large expenditure by farmers of that prefecture on the\r\nmarriage of their daughters. \"It is not so costly as the boys'\r\neducation and it procures a good reception for the girl from\r\nfather-and mother-in-law. The pinch comes when there is a second and\r\nthird daughter, for the average balance in hand of a peasant\r\nproprietor in this prefecture at the end of the year is only 48 yen.\r\nBorrowing is necessary and I heard of one bankruptcy. The Governor\r\ntried to stop the custom but it is too old. They say Toyama people\r\nspend more proportionately than the people in other prefectures. In\r\ngeneral they do not keep a horse or ox. I heard of young farmers\r\nstealing each other's crops. Parents are very severe upon a daughter\r\nwho becomes ill-famed, for when they seek a husband for her they must\r\nspend more. So mostly daughters keep their purity before marriage. But\r\nI know parts of Japan where a large number of the girls have ceased to\r\nbe virtuous. Concerning the priests, those of Toyama are the worst. A\r\npeasant proprietor with seven of a family and a balance at the end of\r\nthe year of 100 yen must pay 30 to 40 yen to the temple. Some priests\r\nthreaten the farmer, saying that if he does not pay as much as is\r\nimposed on him by the collector an inferior Buddha will go past his\r\ndoor. Priests want to keep farmers foolish as long as they can.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130] For prices of land, see Appendix LIV.\r\n\r\n[131] There are about 116,000 Shinto shrines of all grades and 14,000\r\npriests, and 71,000 temples and 51,000 priests. There are about a\r\ndozen Shinto sects and about thirty Buddhist sects and sub-sects.\r\n\r\n[132] It is done by wading in leech-infested water under a burning sun\r\nand pulling out the weeds by hand and pushing them down into the\r\nsludge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE NUN'S CELL\r\n\r\n(NAGANO)\r\n\r\nIt is one more incitement to a man to do well.--BOSWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nEighty per cent. of Nagano is slope. Hence its dependence on\r\nsericulture. The low stone-strewn roofs of the houses, the railway\r\nsnow shelters and the zig-zag track which the train takes, hint at the\r\nclimatic conditions in winter time. Despite the snow--ski-ing has been\r\npractised for some years--the summer climate of Nagano has been\r\ncompared with that of Champagne and there is one vineyard of 60,000\r\nvines.\r\n\r\nI was invited to join a circle of administrators who were discussing\r\nrural morality and religion. One man said that there was not 20 per\r\ncent. of the villages in which the priests were \"active for social\r\ndevelopment.\" Another speaker of experience declared that \"the four\r\npillars of an agricultural village\" were \"the _sonchō_ (headman), the\r\nschoolmaster, the policeman and the most influential villager.\" He\r\nwent on: \"In Europe religion does many things for the support and\r\ndevelopment of morality, but we look to education, for it aims not at\r\nonly developing intelligence and giving knowledge, but at teaching\r\nvirtue and honesty. But there is something beyond that. Thousands of\r\nour soldiers died willingly in the Russian war. There must have been\r\nsomething at the bottom of their hearts. That something is a certain\r\nsentiment which penetrates deeply the characters of our countrymen.\r\nOur morality and customs have it in their foundations. This spirit is\r\n_Yamato damashii_ (Japanese spirit). It appeared among our warriors as\r\n_bushido_ (the way of the soldier), but it is not the monopoly of\r\nsoldiers. Every Japanese has some of this spirit. It is the moral\r\nbackbone of Japan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to say,\" another speaker declared, \"that I read many\r\nEuropean and American books, but I remain Japanese. Mr. Uchimura sees\r\nthe darkest side of Buddhism and Mr. Lafcadio Hearn expected too much\r\nfrom it. 'So mysterious,' Hearn said, but it is not so mysterious to\r\nus. We must be grateful to him for seeing something of the essence of\r\nour life. Sometimes, however, we may be ashamed of his beautifying\r\nsentences. I am a modern man, but I am not ashamed when my wife is\r\nwith child to pray that it may be healthy and wise. It is possible for\r\nus Japanese to worship some god somewhere without knowing why. The\r\npoet says, 'I do not know the reason of it, but tears fall down from\r\nmy eyes in reverence and gratitude.' I suppose this is natural\r\ntheology. The proverb says, 'Even the head of a sardine is something\r\nif believed in.' I attach more importance to a man's attitude to\r\nsomething higher than himself than to the thing which is revered by\r\nhim. Whether a man goes to Nara and Kyoto or to a Roman Catholic or a\r\nMethodist church he can come home very purified in heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some foreigners have thought well to call us 'half civilised,'\" the\r\nspeaker went on. \"Can it be that uncivilised is something distasteful\r\nto or not understood by Europeans and Americans? We have the ambition\r\nto erect some system of Eastern civilisation. It is possible that we\r\nmay have it in our minds to call some things in Europe 'half\r\ncivilised.' Surely the barbarians are usually the people other than\r\nourselves. When the townsman goes to the country he says the people\r\nare savages. But the countryman finds his fellow-savages quite decent\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some time ago,\" broke in a professor, \"I read a novel by René Bazin\r\nand I could not but think how much alike were our peasants and the\r\npeasants of the West.\"\r\n\r\nThe previous speaker resumed: \"The other day a foreigner laughed in my\r\npresence at our old art of incense burning and actually said that we\r\nwere deficient in the sense of smell. I told him that fifty years ago\r\nour samurai class, in excusing their anti-foreign manifestations,\r\nsaid they could not endure the smell of foreigners, and that to this\r\nday our peasants may be heard to say of Western people, 'They smell;\r\nthey smell of butter and fat.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the city of Nagano early in the morning I went to a large Buddhist\r\ntemple where the authorities had kindly given me special facilities to\r\nsee the treasures--alas! all in a wooden structure. A strange thing\r\nwas the preservation untouched of the room in which the Emperor Meiji\r\nrested thirty years ago. May oblivion be one day granted to that awful\r\nchenille table cover and those appalling chairs which outrage the\r\nbeautiful woodwork and the golden _tatami_ of a great building! At the\r\nentrance of the temple priests in a kind of open office were reading\r\nthe newspaper, playing _gō_ or smoking. More pleasing was the sight of\r\nmatting spread right round the temple below its eaves, in order that\r\nweary pilgrims might sleep there, and the spectacle of travel-stained\r\nwomen tranquilly sleeping or suckling their infants before the shrine\r\nitself. There is a pitch dark underground passage below the floor\r\nround the foundations of the great Buddha, and if the circuit be made\r\nand the lock communicating with the entrance door to the sacred figure\r\nbe fortunately touched on the way, paradise, peasants believe, is\r\nassured. I made the circuit a few moments after an old woman and found\r\nthe lock, and on returning to the temple with the rustic dame knelt\r\nwith her before the shrine as the curtain which veils the big Buddha\r\nwas withdrawn. The face of one wooden figure in the temple had been\r\nworn, like that of many another in Japan, with the stroking that it\r\nhad received from the ailing faithful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A BUDDHIST NUNNERY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRASS-CUTTING TOOLS COMPARED WITH A WESTERN SCYTHE.]\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of visiting the adjoining nunnery. As I was\r\nspecially favoured by a general admission, I asked to be permitted to\r\nsee some nuns' cells. They showed a Buddhist advance on Western ideas.\r\nThe word \"cells\" was a misnomer for beautiful little flower-adorned\r\nrooms of a cheerful Japanese house. The fragile, wistful nun who was\r\nso kind as to speak with me had a consecrated expression. Her dress\r\nwas white, and over it was brocade in a perfect combination of green\r\nand cream. Her head was shaven; her hands, which continually told\r\nher beads, were hidden. Religious services are conducted and sermons\r\nare delivered here and in other nunneries by the nuns themselves. I\r\ncould not but be sorry for some girl children who had become nuns on\r\ntheir relatives' or guardians' decision. Adult newcomers are given a\r\nmonth in which, if they wish, they may repent them of their vows; but\r\nwhat of the children? The head of this nunnery was a member of the\r\nImperial family. The institution, like the temple from which I had\r\njust come, stores thousands of wooden tablets to the memory of the\r\ndead. There are many little receptacles in which the hair, the teeth\r\nor the photographs of believers are preserved. I found that both at\r\nthe nunnery and the temple a practical interest was being shown in the\r\nreformation of ex-criminals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHILD-COLLECTORS OF VILLAGERS' SAVINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUNS PHOTOGRAPHED IN A \"CELL\" BY THE AUTHOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUDENTS' STUDY AT AN AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\nWhile in the highlands of Nagano I spent a night at Karuizawa, a hill\r\nresort at which tired missionaries and their families, not only from\r\nall parts of Japan but from China, gather in the summer months beyond\r\nthe reach of the mosquito.[133] I stayed in the summer cottage of my\r\ntravelling companion's brother-in-law. The family consisted of a\r\nreserved, cultivated man with a pretty wife of what I have heard a\r\nforeigner call \"the maternal, domestic type.\" In their owlishness\r\nnewcomers to the country are inclined to commiserate all Japanese\r\nhousewives as the \"slaves of their husbands.\" They would have been\r\nsadly wrong in such thoughts about this happy wife and mother. The\r\neldest boy, a wholesome-looking lad, had just passed through the\r\nmiddle school on his way to the university, and spoke to me in simple\r\nEnglish with that air of responsibility which the eldest son so soon\r\nacquires in Japan. His brothers and sisters enjoyed a happy relation\r\nwith him and with each other. The whole family was merry, unselfish\r\nand, in the best sense of the word, educated. As we knelt on our\r\n_zabuton_ we refreshed ourselves with tea and the fine view of the\r\nactive volcano, Asama, and chatted on schools, holidays, books, the\r\ncountry and religion. After a while, a little to my surprise, the\r\nmother in her sweet voice gravely said that if I would not mind at all\r\nshe would like very much to ask me two questions. The first was, \"Are\r\nthe people who go to the Christian church here all Christians?\" and\r\nthe second, \"Are Christians as affectionate as Japanese?\"\r\n\r\nKaruizawa, which is full of ill-nourished, scabby-headed,\r\n\"bubbly-nosed\"[134] Japanese children, is an impoverished place on one\r\nof the ancient highways. We took ourselves along the road until we\r\nreached at a slightly higher altitude the decayed village of Oiwaké.\r\nWhen the railway came near it finished the work of desolation which\r\nthe cessation of the daimyos' progresses to Yedo (now Tokyo) had begun\r\nhalf a century ago. In the days of the Shogun three-quarters of the\r\n300 houses were inns. Now two-thirds of the houses have become\r\nuninhabitable, or have been sold, taken down and rebuilt elsewhere.\r\nThe Shinto shrines are neglected and some are unroofed, the Zen temple\r\nis impoverished, the school is comfortless and a thousand tombstones\r\nin the ancient burying ground among the trees are half hidden in moss\r\nand undergrowth.\r\n\r\nThe farm rents now charged in Oiwaké had not been changed for thirty,\r\nforty or fifty years. In the old inn there was a Shinto shrine, about\r\n12 ft. long by nearly 2 ft. deep, with latticed sliding doors. It\r\ncontained a dusty collection of charms and memorials dating back for\r\ngenerations. Outside in the garden at the spring I found an irregular\r\nrow of half a dozen rather dejected-looking little stone _hokora_\r\nabout a foot high. Some had faded _gohei_ thrust into them, but from\r\nthe others the clipped paper strips had blown away. At the foot of the\r\ngarden I discovered a somewhat elaborate wooden shrine in a\r\ndilapidated state. \"Few country people,\" someone said to me, \"know who\r\nis enshrined at such a place.\" It is generally thought that these\r\nshrines are dedicated to the fox. But the foxes are merely the\r\nmessengers of the shrine, as is shown by the figures of crouching or\r\nsquatting foxes at either side. A well-known professor lately arrived\r\nat the conviction that the god worshipped at such shrines is the god\r\nof agriculture. He went so far as to recommend the faculty of\r\nagriculture at Tokyo university to have a shrine erected within its\r\nwalls to this divinity, but the suggestion was not adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the course of another chat with the old host of the inn he referred\r\nto the time, close on half a century ago, when 3,000 hungry peasants\r\nmarched through the district demanding rice. They did no harm. \"They\r\nwere satisfied when they were given food; the peasants at that time\r\nwere heavily oppressed.\" To-day the people round about look as if they\r\nwere oppressed by the ghosts of old-time tyrants. But there is\r\n\"something that doth linger\" of self-respect. When we left on our way\r\nto Tokyo I gave the man who brought our bags a mile in a barrow to the\r\nstation 40 sen. He returned 10 sen, saying that 30 sen was enough.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] Although, as has been seen, the rural problems under\r\ninvestigation in this book are inextricably bound up with religion,\r\nlimits of space make it necessary to reserve for another volume the\r\nconsideration of the large and complex question of missionary work.\r\n\r\n[134] As to the \"bubbly-nosed callant,\" to quote the description given\r\nof young Smollett, nasal unpleasantness seems to be popularly regarded\r\nas a sign of health. The constant sight of it is one of the minor\r\ndiscomforts of travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN AND OUT OF THE SILK PREFECTURE[135]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS BEHIND THE PICTURESQUE\r\n\r\n(SAITAMA, GUMMA, NAGANO AND YAMANASHI)\r\n\r\nA foreigner who comes among us without prejudice may speak his\r\nmind freely.--GOLDSMITH\r\n\r\n\r\nI went back to Nagano to visit the silk industrial regions. My route\r\nlay through the prefectures of Saitama and Gumma. I left Tokyo on the\r\nlast day of June. Many farmers were threshing their barley. On the\r\ndry-land patches, where the grain crop had been harvested, soya bean,\r\nsown between the rows of grain long before harvest, was becoming\r\nbushier now that it was no longer overshadowed. Maize in most places\r\nwas about a foot high, but where it had been sown early was already\r\ntwice that height. The sweet potato had been planted out from its\r\nnursery bed for weeks. Here and there were small crops of tea which\r\nhad been severely picked for its second crop. I noticed melons,\r\ncucumbers and squashes, and patches of the serviceable burdock. Many\r\npaddy farmers had water areas devoted to lotus, but the big floating\r\nleaves were not yet illumined by the mysterious beauty of the\r\nhoney-scented flowers.\r\n\r\nIn order to imagine the scene on the rice flats, the reader must not\r\nthink of the glistering paddy fields[136] as stretching in an unbroken\r\nmonotonous series over the plain. Occasionally a rocky patch,\r\noutcropping from the paddy tract, made a little island of wood.\r\nSometimes it was a sacred grove in which one caught a glimpse of a\r\nShinto shrine or the head stones of the dead. Sometimes there was a\r\nlittle clump of cropped tree greenery which kept a farmhouse cool in\r\nsummer and, at another time of the year, sheltered from the wind. Few\r\nhouseholders were too poor or too busy to be without their little\r\npatch of flowers.\r\n\r\nBefore the train climbed out of the Kwanto plain temperature of not\r\nfar below 100° F. the planting of rice seemed to be almost an enviable\r\noccupation. The peasant had his great umbrella-shaped straw hat,\r\nsometimes an armful of green stuff tied on his back, and a delicious\r\nfeeling of being up to the knees in water or mud on a hot day-one\r\nrecalled the mud baths of the West-when the alternative was walking on\r\na dusty road, digging on the sun-baked upland or perspiring in a house\r\nor the train.\r\n\r\nWith the rise in the level a few mulberries began to appear and\r\ngradually they occupied a large part of the holdings. Sometimes the\r\nmulberries were cultivated as shoots from a stump a little above\r\nground level, and sometimes as a kind of small standard. As mulberry\r\nculture increased, the silk factories' whitewashed cocoon stores and\r\nthe tall red and black iron chimneys of the factories themselves\r\nbecame more numerous. It is a pity that the silk factory is not always\r\nso innocent-looking inside as the pure white exterior of its stores\r\nmight suggest. It is certain that the overworked girl operatives,\r\nsitting at their steaming basins, drawing the silk from the soaked\r\ncocoons, were glad to find the weather conditions such that they could\r\nhave the sides of their reeling sheds removed.\r\n\r\nAt many of the railway stations there were stacks of large, round,\r\nflat bean cakes, for the farmer feeds his \"cake\" to his fields direct,\r\nnot through the medium of cattle. Although a paddy receives less\r\nagreeable nutritive materials than bean cake, the extensive use of\r\nthis cake must be comforting to a little school of rural reformers in\r\nthe West. These ardent vegetarians have refused to listen to the\r\nallegation that vegetarianism was impossible because without\r\nmeat-eating there would be no cattle and therefore no nitrogen for the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the bean cakes at the stations which caught my\r\nattention but the extensive use of lime. Square miles of paddy field\r\nwere white with powdered lime, scattered before the planting of the\r\nrice, an operation which in the higher altitudes would not be finished\r\nuntil well on in July.\r\n\r\nA contented and prosperous countryside was no doubt the impression\r\nreflected to many passengers in the train that sunny day. But I knew\r\nhow closely pressed the farmers had been by the rise in prices of many\r\nthings that they had got into the way of needing. I had learnt, too,\r\nthe part that superstition[137] as well as simple faith played in the\r\nlives of the country folk. When, however, I pondered the way in which\r\nthe rural districts had been increasingly invaded by factories run\r\nunder the commercial sanctions of our eighteen-forties, I asked myself\r\nwhether there might not be superstitions of the economic world as well\r\nas of religious and social life.\r\n\r\nI heard a Japanese speak of being well treated at inns in the old days\r\nfor 20 sen a night. It should be remembered, however, that there is a\r\nsystem not only of tipping inn servants but of tipping the inn. The\r\ngift to the inn is called _chadai_ and guests are expected to offer a\r\nsum which has some relation to their position and means and the food\r\nand treatment they expect. I have stayed at inns where I have paid as\r\nmuch _chadai_ as bill. To pay 50 per cent. of the bill as _chadai_ is\r\ncommon. The idea behind _chadai_ is that the inn-keeper charges only\r\nhis out-of-pocket expenses and that therefore the guest naturally\r\ndesires to requite him. In acknowledgment of _chadai_ the inn-keeper\r\nbrings a gift to the guest at his departure--fans, pottery, towels,\r\npicture postcards, fruit or slabs of stiff acidulated fruit jelly (in\r\none inn of grapes and in another of plums) laid between strips of\r\nmaize leaf. The right time to give _chadai_ is on entering the hotel,\r\nafter the \"welcome tea.\" In handing money to any person in Japan,\r\nexcept a porter or a _kurumaya_, the cash or notes are wrapped in\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nOn the journey from the city of Nagano to Matsumoto, wonderful views\r\nwere unfolded of terraced rice fields, and, above these, of terraced\r\nfields of mulberry. How many hundred feet high the terraces rose as\r\nthe train climbed the hills I do not know, but I have had no more\r\nvivid impression of the triumphs of agricultural hydraulic\r\nengineering. We were seven minutes in passing through one tunnel at a\r\nhigh elevation.\r\n\r\nI spoke in the train with a man who had a dozen _chō_ under grapes, 20\r\nper cent. being European varieties and 80 per cent. American. He said\r\nthat some of the people in his district were \"very poor.\" Some farmers\r\nhad made money in sericulture too quickly for it to do them good. He\r\nvolunteered the opinion, in contrast with the statement made to me\r\nduring our journey to Niigata, that the people of the plains were\r\nmorally superior to the people of the mountains. The reason he gave\r\nwas that \"there are many recreations in the plains whereas in the\r\nmountains there is only one.\" In most of the mountain villages he knew\r\nthree-quarters of the young men had relations with women, mostly with\r\nthe girls of the village or the adjoining village. He would not make\r\nthe same charge against more than ten per cent. of the young men of\r\nthe plains, and \"it is after all with teahouse girls.\" He thought that\r\nthere were \"too many temples and too many sects, so the priests are\r\nstarved.\"\r\n\r\nAn itinerant agricultural instructor in sericulture who joined in our\r\nconversation was not much concerned by the plight of the priests. \"The\r\ncauses of goodness in our people,\" he said, \"are family tradition and\r\nhome training. Candidly, we believe our morals are not so bad on the\r\nwhole. We are now putting most stress on economic development. How to\r\nmaintain their families is the question that troubles people most.\r\nWith that question unsolved it is preaching to a horse to preach\r\nmorality. We can always find high ideals and good leaders when\r\neconomic conditions improve. The development of morality is our final\r\naim, but it is encouraged for six years at the primary school. The\r\nchild learns that if it does bad things it will be laughed at and\r\ndespised by the neighbours and scolded by its parents. We are busy\r\nwith the betterment of economic conditions and questions about\r\nmorality and religion puzzle us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Matsumoto I met a rural dignitary who deplored the\r\nincreasing tendency of city men to invest in rural property.\r\n\"Sometimes when a peasant sells his land he sets up as a\r\nmoney-lender.\" I was told that nearly every village had a sericultural\r\nco-operative association, which bought manures, mulberry trees and\r\nsilk-worm eggs, dried cocoons and hatched eggs for its members and\r\nspent money on the destruction of rats. Of recent years the county\r\nagricultural association had given 5 yen per _tan_ to farmers who\r\nplanted improved sorts of mulberry. About half the farmers in the\r\ncounty had manure houses. Some 800 farmers in the county kept a\r\nlabourer.\r\n\r\nI went to see a _gunchō_ and read on his wall: \"Do not get angry.\r\nWork! Do not be in a hurry, yet do not be lazy.\" \"These being my\r\nfaults,\" he explained, \"I specially wrote them out.\" There was also on\r\nhis wall a _kakemono_ reading: \"At twenty I found that even a plain\r\nhouseholder may influence the future of his province; at thirty that\r\nhe may influence the future of his nation; at forty that he may\r\ninfluence the future of the whole world.\" Below this stirring\r\nsentiment was a portrait of the writer, a samurai scholar, from a\r\nphotograph taken with a camera which he had made himself. He lived in\r\nthe last period of the Shogunate and studied Dutch books. He was\r\nkilled by an assassin at the instance, it was believed, of the Shogun.\r\n\r\nOne of the noteworthy things of Matsumoto was the agricultural\r\nassociation's market. Another piece of organisation in that part of\r\nthe world was fourteen institutes where girls were instructed in the\r\nwork of silk factory hands. The teachers' salaries were paid by the\r\nfactories. So were also the expenses of the silk experts of the local\r\nauthorities. On the day I left the city the daily paper contained an\r\nannouncement of lectures on hygiene to women on three successive days,\r\n\"the chief of police to be present.\" This paper was demanding the\r\nexemption of students from the bicycle tax, the rate of which varies\r\nin different prefectures.\r\n\r\nA young man was brought to see me who was specialising in musk melons.\r\nHe said that the Japanese are gradually getting out of their\r\npartiality for unripe fruit.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the Suwas we saw many wretched dwellings. The feature\r\nof the landscape was the silk factories' tall iron chimneys,\r\nordinarily black though sometimes red, white or blue.\r\n\r\nIt is not commonly understood that Japanese lads by the time they\r\n\"graduate\" from the middle school into the higher school have had some\r\nelementary military training. A higher-school youth knows how to\r\nhandle a rifle and has fired twice at a target. At Kami Suwa the\r\nproblem of how middle-class boys should procure economical lodging\r\nwhile attending their classes had been solved by self-help. An\r\nex-scholar of twenty had managed to borrow 4,000 yen and had proceeded\r\nto build on a hillside a dormitory accommodating thirty-six boarders.\r\nLads did the work of levelling the ground and digging the well. The\r\nfrugal lines on which the lodging-house was conducted by the lads\r\nthemselves may be judged from the fact that 5 yen a month covered\r\neverything. Breakfast consisted of rice, _miso_ soup and pickles.\r\nCooking and the emptying of the _benjo_[138] were done by the lads in\r\nturn. A kitchen garden was run by common effort. Among the many\r\nnotices on the walls was one giving the names of the residents who\r\nshowed up at 5 o'clock in the morning for a cold bath and fencing. I\r\nalso saw the following instruction written by the founder of the\r\nhouse, which is read aloud every morning by each resident in turn:\r\n\r\nBe independent and pure and strive to make your characters more\r\nbeautiful. Expand your thought. Help each other to accomplish your\r\nambitions. Be active and steady and do not lose your self-control. Be\r\nfaithful to friends and righteous and polite. Be silent and keep\r\norder. Do not be luxurious (_sic_). Keep everything clean. Pay\r\nattention to sanitation. Do not neglect physical exercises. Be\r\ndiligent and develop your intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe borrower of the 4,000 yen with which the institution was built\r\nmanaged to pay it back within seven years with interest, out of the\r\nsubscriptions of residents and ex-residents.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural authority whom I met spoke of \"farming families\r\nliving from hand to mouth and their land slipping into the possession\r\nof landlords\"; also of a fifth of the peasants in the prefecture being\r\ntenants. A young novelist who had been wandering about the Suwa\r\ndistrict had been impressed by the grim realities of life in poor\r\nfarmers' homes and cited facts on which he based a low view of rural\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nSuwa Lake lies more than 3,500 ft. above sea level and in winter is\r\ncovered with skaters. The country round about is remarkable\r\nagriculturally for the fact that many farmers are able to lead into\r\ntheir paddies not only warm water from the hot springs but water from\r\nammonia springs, so economising considerably in their expenditure on\r\nmanure. A simple windmill for lifting the fertilising water is sold\r\nfor only 4 yen.\r\n\r\nWe went to Kōfu, the capital of Yamanashi prefecture, through many\r\nmountain tunnels and ravines. Entrancing is the just word for this\r\nregion in the vicinity of the Alps. But joy in the beauty through\r\nwhich we passed is tinged for the student of rural life by thoughts of\r\nthe highlander's difficulties in getting a living in spots where quiet\r\nstreams may become in a few hours ungovernable torrents. I remember\r\nglimpses of grapes and persimmons, of parties of middle-school boys\r\ntramping out their holiday--every inn reduces its terms for them--and\r\nof half a dozen peasant girls bathing in a shaded stream. But there\r\nwere less pleasing scenes: hills deforested and paddies wrecked by a\r\nwaste of stones and gravel flung over them in time of flood. Here and\r\nthere the indomitable farmers, counting on the good behaviour of the\r\nriver for a season or two, were endeavouring, with enormous labour, to\r\nresume possession of what had been their own. The spectacle\r\nillustrated at once their spirit and their industry and their need of\r\nland. At night we slept at Kōfu at \"the inn of greeting peaks.\" In the\r\nmorning a Governor with imagination told me of the prefecture's\r\ngallant enterprises in afforestation and river embanking at\r\nexpenditures which were almost crippling.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[135] The three leading silk prefectures are in order: Nagano,\r\nFukushima and Gumma.\r\n\r\n[136] At this time of the year, when the rice plants are small, the\r\nwater in the paddies is still conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[137] An old Japan hand once counselled me that \"the thing to find out\r\nin sociological enquiries is not people's religions but their\r\nsuperstitions.\"\r\n\r\n[138] See Appendix IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH, BRIDAL AND DEATH OF THE SILK-WORM\r\n\r\n(NAGANO)\r\n\r\nThe mulberry leaf knoweth not that it shall be silk.--_Arab proverb_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne acre in every dozen in Japan produces mulberry leaves for feeding\r\nthe silk-worms which two million farming families--more than a third\r\nof the farming families of the country--painstakingly rear.\r\n\r\nBut the mulberry is not the only mark of a sericultural district. Its\r\nmark may be seen in the tall chimneys of the factories and in the\r\nstructure of the farmers' houses. Breeders of silk-worms are often\r\nwell enough off to have tiled instead of thatched roofs; they have\r\nfrequently two storeys to their dwellings; and they have almost always\r\na roof ventilator so that the vitiated air from the _hibachi_-heated\r\nsilk-worm chambers may be carried off. Yet another sign of sericulture\r\nbeing a part of the agricultural activities of a district is its\r\nprosperity. Silk-worms produce the most valuable of all Japanese\r\nexports. Japan sends abroad more raw silk than any other country.[139]\r\n\r\nIt is in the middle of the country that sericulture chiefly nourishes.\r\nThe smallest output of raw silk is from the most northerly prefecture\r\nand from the prefecture in the extreme south-west of the mainland. But\r\nhuman aptitude plays its part as well as climate. The Japanese hand is\r\na wonderful piece of mechanism--look at the hands of the next Japanese\r\nyou meet--and in sericulture its delicate touch is used to the utmost\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe gains of sericulture are not made without corresponding\r\nsacrifices. Silk-worm raising is infinitely laborious. The constant\r\npicking of leaves, the bringing of them home and the chopping and\r\nsupplying of these leaves to the smallest of all live stock and the\r\nmaintenance of a proper temperature in the rearing-chamber day and\r\nnight mean unending work. The silk-worms may not be fed less than four\r\nor five times in the day; in their early life they are fed seven or\r\neight times. This is the feeding system for spring caterpillars.\r\nSummer and autumn breeds must have two or three more meals. The men\r\nand women who attend to them, particularly the women, are worn out by\r\nthe end of the season. \"The women have only three hours' rest in the\r\ntwenty-four hours,\" I remember someone saying. \"They never loose their\r\n_obi_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillars emerge from the tiny, pin-head-like eggs of the\r\nsilk-worm moth they are minute creatures. Therefore the mulberry\r\nleaves are chopped very fine indeed. They are chopped less and less\r\nfine as the silk-worms grow, until finally whole leaves and leaves\r\nadhering to the shoots are given. Some rearers are skilful enough to\r\nsupply from the very beginning leaves or leaves still on the shoots.\r\nThe caterpillars live in bamboo trays or \"beds\" on racks. In the house\r\nof one farmer I found caterpillars about three-quarters of an inch\r\nlong occupying fifteen trays. When the silk-worms grew larger they\r\nwould occupy two hundred trays.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, when not produced on the farm, are bought adhering to cards\r\nabout a foot square. There are usually marked on these cards\r\ntwenty-eight circles about 2 ins. in diameter. Each circle is covered\r\nwith eggs. The eggs come to be arranged in these convenient circles\r\nbecause, as will be explained later on, the moths have been induced to\r\nlay within bottomless round tins placed on the circles on the cards.\r\nThe eggs are sticky when laid and therefore adhere. In a year\r\n35,000,000 cards, containing about a billion eggs, are produced on\r\nsome 10,000 egg-raising farms.\r\n\r\nThe eggs--they are called \"seed\"--are hatched in the spring (end of\r\nApril--as soon as the first leaves of the mulberry are available--to\r\nthe middle of May), summer (June and July) and autumn (August and\r\nOctober). It takes from three to seven days--according to\r\ntemperature--for the \"seed\" to hatch, and from twenty to thirty-two\r\ndays--according to temperature--for the silk-worms to reach maturity.\r\nHalf the hatching is done in spring. In one farmer's house I visited\r\nin the spring season I found that he had hatched fifty cards of\r\n\"seed.\" From the birth of the caterpillars to the formation of cocoons\r\nthe casualties must be reckoned at ten per cent. daily. Not more than\r\neighty-five per cent. of the cocoons which are produced are of good\r\nquality. The remainder are misshapen or contain dead chrysalises. As\r\nthere are more than a thousand breeds of silk-worm, all cocoons are\r\nnot of the same shape and colour. Some are oval; some are shaped like\r\na monkey nut. Most are white but some are yellow and others yellow\r\ntinted.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world of stock raising there is nothing more remarkable\r\nthan the birth of silk-worm moths. The cocoons on the racks in the\r\nfarmer's loft are covered by sheets of newspaper in which a number of\r\nround holes about three-quarters of an inch in diameter have been cut.\r\nWhen the moths emerge from their cocoons they seek these openings\r\ntowards the light and creep through to the upper side of the\r\nnewspaper. For newly born things they come up through these openings\r\nwith astonishing ardour. In body and wings the moths are flour white.\r\nWhite garments are suitable for the babe, the bride and the dead, and\r\nthe moth perfected in the cocoon is arrayed not only for its birth but\r\nfor bridal and death, which come upon it in swift succession. The male\r\nas well as the female is in white and is distinguishable by being\r\nsomewhat smaller in size. On the newspaper the few males who have not\r\nfound partners are executing wild dances, their wings whirring the\r\nwhile at a mad pace. When from time to time they cease dancing they\r\nhaunt the holes in the paper through which the newly born moths\r\nemerge. When a female appears a male instantly rushes towards her, or\r\nrather the two creatures rush towards one another, and they are at\r\nonce locked in a fast embrace. Immediately their wings cease to\r\nflutter, the only commotion on the newspaper being made by the unmated\r\nmales. In a hatching-room these males on the stacks of trays are so\r\nnumerous that the place is filled with the sound of the whirring of\r\ntheir wings. The down flies from their wings to such an extent that\r\none continually sneezes. The spectacle of the stacks of trays covered\r\nby these ecstatic moths is remarkable, but still more remarkable is\r\nthe thrilling sense of the power of the life-force in a supposedly low\r\nform of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe wonder of the scene is missed, no doubt, by most of those who are\r\nhabituated to it. From time to time weary, stolid-looking girls or old\r\nwomen lift down the trays and run their hands over them in order to\r\npick up superfluous male moths. Sometimes the male moths are walking\r\nabout the newspaper, sometimes they are torn callously from the\r\nembrace of their mates. The fate of the male moths is to be flung into\r\na basket where they stay until the next day, when perhaps some of them\r\nmay be mated again. The novice is impressed not only by the\r\nruthlessness of this treatment but by the way in which the whole loft\r\nis littered by male moths which have fallen or have been flung on the\r\nfloor and are being trampled on.\r\n\r\nThe female moths, when their partners have been removed, are taken\r\ndownstairs in newspapers in order to be put into the little tin\r\nreceptacles where the eggs are to be laid. On a tray there are spread\r\nout a number of egg cards with, as before mentioned, twenty-eight\r\nprinted circles on each of them. On these circles are placed the\r\ntwenty-eight half-inch-high bottomless enclosures of tin. Some one\r\ntakes up a handful of moths and scatters them over the tins. Some of\r\nthe moths fall neatly into a tin apiece. Others are helped into the\r\nlittle enclosures in which, to do them credit, they are only too\r\nwilling to take up their quarters. The curious thing is the way in\r\nwhich each moth settles down within her ring. Indeed from the moment\r\nof her emergence from the cocoon until now she has never used her\r\nwings to fly. Nor did the male moth seem to wish to fly. The sexes\r\nconcentrate their whole attention on mating. After that the female\r\nthinks of nothing but laying eggs. Almost immediately after she is\r\nplaced within her little tin she begins to deposit eggs, and within a\r\nfew hours the circle of the card is covered.\r\n\r\nFood is given neither to the females nor to the males. Those which are\r\nnot kept in reserve for possible use on the second day are flung out\r\nof doors. When the female moth has deposited her eggs she also is\r\ndestroyed.[140] The _shoji_ of the breeding and egg-laying rooms\r\npermit only of a diffused light. The discarded moths are cast out into\r\nthe brilliant sunshine where they are eaten by poultry or are left to\r\ndie and serve as manure.\r\n\r\nSericulture is always a risky business. There is first the risk of a\r\nfall in prices. Just before I reached Japan prices were so low that\r\nmany people despaired of being able to continue the business, and\r\nshortly after I left there was a crisis in the silk trade in which\r\nnumbers of silk factories failed. At the time I was last in a\r\nsilk-worm farmer's house cocoons were worth from 5 to 6 yen per _kwan_\r\nof 8-1/4 lbs. From 8 to 10 _kwan_ of cocoons could be expected from a\r\nsingle egg card. Eggs were considered to be at a high price when they\r\nwere more than 2 yen per card. The risks of the farmer are increased\r\nwhen he launches out and buys mulberry leaves to supplement those\r\nproduced on his own land. Sometimes the price of leaves is so high\r\nthat farmers throw away some of their silk-worms. The risks run by the\r\nman who grows mulberries beyond his own leaf requirements on the\r\nchance of selling are also considerable.\r\n\r\nBeyond the risk of falling prices or of a short mulberry crop there is\r\nin sericulture the risk of disease. One advantage of the system in\r\nwhich the eggs are laid in circles on the cards instead of all over\r\nthem is that if any disease should be detected the affected areas can\r\nbe easily cut out with a knife and destroyed. Disease is so serious a\r\nmatter that silk-worm breeding, as contrasted with silk-worm raising,\r\nis restricted to those who have obtained licences. The silk-worm\r\nbreeder is not only licensed. His silkworms, cocoons and mother moths\r\nare all in turn officially examined. Breeding \"seeds\" were laid one\r\nyear by about 33,000,000 odd moths; common \"seeds\" by about\r\n948,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf recent years enormous progress has been made in combating disease.\r\nI have spoken of how a silk-worm district may be recognised by the\r\nstructure of the farmhouses and the prosperity of the farmers, but\r\nanother striking sign of sericulture is the trays and mats lying in\r\nthe sun in front of farmers' dwellings or on the hot stones of the\r\nriver banks in order to get thoroughly purified from germs. It is\r\nillustrative of the progress that has been made under scientific\r\ninfluence, that whereas twenty years ago a sericulturist would reckon\r\non losing his silk-worm harvest completely once in five years, such a\r\nloss is now rare. Scientific instructors have their difficulties in\r\nJapan as in the rural districts of other countries, but the people\r\nrespect authority, and they are accustomed to accept instruction given\r\nin the form of directions. Also the Japanese have an unending interest\r\nin the new thing. Further, there is a continual desire to excel for\r\nthe national advantage and in emulation of the foreigner. The advance\r\nin scientific knowledge in the rural districts is remarkable, because\r\nit is in such contrast with the primitive lives of the country people.\r\nPicture the surprise of British or American farmers were they brought\r\nface to face with thermometers, electric light and a working knowledge\r\nof bacteriology in the houses of peasants in breech clouts.\r\n\r\nIt was while I was trying to learn something of the sericultural\r\nindustry that I had the opportunity of visiting a noteworthy\r\ninstitution. It is noteworthy, among other reasons, because I seldom\r\nmet a foreigner in Japan who knew of its existence. It is the great\r\nUeda Sericultural College in the prefecture of Nagano. I was struck\r\nnot only by its extent but by its systematised efficiency. On a level\r\nwith the director's eyes was a motto in large lettering, \"Be diligent.\r\nDevelop your virtues.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEACHERS OF A VILLAGE SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRLS CARRYING BALES OF RICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERICULTURAL SCHOOL STUDENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe Institute devotes itself to mulberries, silk-worms and silk\r\nmanufacture. There are 200 students, as many as it will hold. The\r\nyoung men become teachers of sericulture, advisers in mills and\r\nexperts of co-operative sericultural societies. The institution, in\r\naddition to the fees it receives and its earnings from its own\r\nproducts, some 33,000 yen in all, has an annual Government subsidy of\r\nabout 114,000 yen. There are other sericultural colleges doing similar\r\nwork in Tokyo and Kyoto, and there is also in the capital the Imperial\r\nSericultural Experiment Station (with a staff of 87), where I saw\r\nall sorts of research work in progress. This experiment station has\r\nhalf a dozen branches scattered up and down the silk districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF THE SILK FACTORIES IN KAMISUWA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE ASSEMBLY-ROOM.]\r\n\r\nAt Ueda I went through corridors and rooms, sterilised thrice a year,\r\nto visit professors engaged in a variety of enquiries. One professor\r\nhad turned into a kind of beef tea the pupæ thrown away when the\r\ncocoons are unwound; another had made from the residual oil two or\r\nthree kinds of soap. The usual thing at a silk factory is for the\r\npupæ, which are exposed to view when the silk is unrolled from the\r\nscalded cocoons, to lie about in horrid heaps until they are sold as\r\nmanure or carp food. The professor declared that his product was equal\r\nto a third of the total weight of the pupæ utilised, and was sure that\r\nit could be sold at a fifteenth of the price of Western beef essences.\r\nThe Director of the College had tried the product with his breakfast\r\nfor a fortnight and avowed that during the experiment he was never so\r\nperky.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to look into the well-kept dormitories of the\r\nstudents, where there was evidence, in books, pictures and athletic\r\nmaterial, of a strenuous life. The young men are made fit not only by\r\n_judō_, fencing, archery, tennis and general athletics, but by being\r\nsent up the mountains on Sundays. The men are kept so hard that at the\r\nopen fencing contest twice a year the visitors are usually beaten. The\r\ndirector quoted to me Roosevelt's \"Sweat and be saved.\"\r\n\r\nFrom men we went to machines and mulberries. I inspected all sorts of\r\nhot chambers for killing cocoons. I saw, in rooms draped in black\r\nvelvet like the pictured scenes at a beheading, silk testing for\r\nlustre and colour. I gazed with respect on many kinds of winding and\r\nweaving machinery. Then, going out into the experiment fields, I\r\nstrode through more varieties of mulberry than I had imagined to\r\nexist. There are supposed to be 500 sorts in the country but many are\r\nno doubt duplicates. The varieties differ so much in shape and texture\r\nof leaf that the novice would not take some of them for mulberries.\r\n\r\nIt was held that it would not be difficult to increase the mulberry\r\narea in Japan by another quarter of a million acres. The yield of\r\nleaves might be raised by 3,300 lbs. per acre if the right sort of\r\nbushes were always grown and the right sort of treatment were given to\r\nthem and to the soil. As to the additional labour needed for an\r\nextended sericulture, the annual increase in the population of Japan\r\nwould provide it. I was told that \"the technics of sericulture are\r\nsure to improve.\" It would be easy to raise the yield 2 _kwan_ per egg\r\ncard for the whole country. Within a seven-year period the production\r\nof cocoons per egg card had become 20 per cent. better. The talk was\r\nof doubling the present yield of cocoons. The \"proper encouragement\"\r\nneeded for doubling the production of cocoons was more technical\r\ninstruction and more co-operative societies. There had been a\r\ncontinual rise in the world's demand for silk and there was no need to\r\nfear \"artificial silk.\" \"People who buy it often come to appreciate\r\nnatural silk.\" And I read in an official publication that \"the climate\r\nof Japan is suitable for the cultivation of mulberry trees from\r\nsouth-west Formosa to Hokkaido in the north.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] For statistics of sericulture, see Appendix XXXIX.\r\n\r\n[140] She is examined microscopically in order to make sure that she\r\nwas not affected by infectious disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\"GIRL COLLECTORS\" AND FACTORIES\r\n\r\n(NAGANO AND YAMANASHI)\r\n\r\nAt your return show the truth.--FROISSART\r\n\r\n\r\nI visited factories in more than one prefecture. At the first\r\nfactory--it employed about 1,000 girls and 200 men--work began at 4.30\r\na.m., breakfast was at 5 and the next meal at 10.30. The stoppages for\r\neating were for a few minutes only. A cake was handed to each girl at\r\nher machine at 3. Suppertime came after work was finished at 7.[141]\r\nNo money was paid the first year. The second year the wages might be 3\r\nor 4 yen a month. The statement was made that at the end of her five\r\nyears' term a girl might have 300 yen, but that this sum was not\r\nwithin the reach of all.[142] The girls were driven at top speed by a\r\nflag system in which one bay competed with another and was paid\r\naccording to its earnings. Owing to the heat the flushed girls\r\nprobably looked better in health than they really were. They were fat\r\nin the face, but this could not be regarded as an indication of their\r\ngeneral well-being. It was admitted that some girls left through\r\nillness. Employees returned to their homes for January and February,\r\nwhen the factory was closed down; there was also three days' holiday\r\nin June. In the dormitory I noticed that each girl had the space of\r\none mat only (6 ft. by 3 ft.). Twenty-two girls slept in each\r\ndormitory. The men connected with this factory were low-looking and\r\nshifty-eyed.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural expert who was well acquainted with the conditions of\r\nsilk manufacture and of the district and was in a disinterested\r\nposition told me after my visit to this factory how the foremen\r\nscoured the country for girl labour during January and February. The\r\nsuccess of the _kemban_ or girl collector was due to the poverty of\r\nthe people, who were glad \"to be relieved of the cost of a daughter's\r\nfood.\" Occasionally the _kemban_ had sub-agents. The mill proprietors\r\nwere in competition for skilled girls, and money was given by a\r\n_kemban_ intent on stealing another factory's hand.\r\n\r\nThe novices had no contract. The contract of a skilled girl provided\r\nthat she should serve at the factory for a specified period and that\r\nif she failed to do so, she should pay back twenty times the 5 yen or\r\nwhatever sum had been advanced to her. Obviously 100 yen would be a\r\nprohibitive sum for a peasant's daughter to find. The amount of the\r\nworkers' pay was not specified in the contract. The document was\r\nplainly one-sided and would be regarded in an English court as against\r\npublic policy and unenforceable. Married women might take an infant\r\nwith them to the factory. In more than one factory I saw several\r\nthin-faced babies.\r\n\r\nThe effect of factory life on girls, a man who knew the countryside\r\nwell told me, was \"not good.\" The girls had weakened constitutions as\r\nthe result of their factory life and when they married had fewer than\r\nthe normal number of children. The general result of factory life was\r\ndegeneration. The girls \"corrupted their villages.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom was, I understood, that the girls were kept on the factory\r\npremises except when they could allege urgent business in town. But\r\nthey were allowed out on the three nights of the _Bon_ festival. It\r\nwas rare that priests visited the factories and there were no shrines\r\nthere. The girls had sometimes \"lessons\" given them and occasionally\r\nstory-tellers or gramophone owners amused them. The food supplied by\r\nsome factories was not at all adequate and the girls had to spend\r\ntheir money at the factory tuck-shops. \"Most proprietors,\" I was told,\r\n\"endeavour to make part of their staff permanent by acting as\r\nmiddlemen to arrange marriages between female and male workers.\" The\r\ninfants of married workers were \"looked after by the youngest\r\napprentices.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place I saw over a factory which employed about 160 girls,\r\nwho were worked from 5:30 a.m. to 6:40 p.m. with twenty minutes for\r\neach meal. If a girl \"broke her contract\" it was the custom to send\r\nher name to other factories so that she could not get work again. The\r\nforemen at this establishment seemed decent men.\r\n\r\nOne who had no financial interest in the silk industry but knew the\r\ndistrict in which this second factory stood said that \"many girls\"\r\ncame home in trouble. The peasants did not like \"the spoiling of their\r\ndaughters,\" but were \"captured in their poverty by the idea of the\r\nmoney to be gained.\" Undoubtedly the factory life was pictured in\r\nglowing colours by the _kemban_.\r\n\r\nIn a third factory there were more than 200 girls and only 15 men. The\r\nproprietor and manager seemed good fellows. I was assured that it was\r\nforbidden for men workers to enter the women's quarters, but on\r\nentering the dormitory I came on a man and woman scuffling. The girls\r\nof this factory and in others had running below their feet an iron\r\npipe which was filled with steam in cold weather. On some days in\r\nJuly, the month in which I visited this factory, I noticed from the\r\ntemperature record sheet that the heat had reached 94 degrees in the\r\nsteamy spinning bays, where, unless the weather be damp, it was\r\nimpossible, because of spinning conditions, to admit fresh air. I saw\r\na complaint box for the workers. As in other factories, there was a\r\ncertain provision of boiled water and ample bathing accommodation. Hot\r\nbaths were taken every night in summer and every other night in\r\nwinter. Here, as elsewhere, though many of the girls were pale and\r\nanaemic, all were clean in their persons, which is more than can be\r\nsaid of all Western factory hands. Work began at 4 a.m. and went on\r\nuntil 7 p.m. From 10 to 15 minutes were allowed for meals. The winter\r\nhours were from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.\r\n\r\nIn this factory, as in others, there was a system of tallies, showing\r\nto all the workers the ranking of the girls for payment. The standard\r\nwage seemed to be 20 sen a day, and the average to which it was\r\nbrought by good work 30 sen. There were thirty or more girls who had\r\ndeductions from their 20 sen. Apprentices were shown as working at a\r\nloss. Once or twice a month a story-teller came to entertain the girls\r\nand every fortnight a teacher gave them instruction. When I asked if a\r\npriest came I was told that \"in this district the families are not so\r\nreligious, so the girls are not so pious.\" Two doctors visited the\r\nfactory, one of them daily. Counting all causes, 5 per cent. of the\r\ngirls returned home. The owner of the factory, a man in good physical\r\ntraining and with an alert and kindly face, said the industry\r\nsucceeded in his district because the employers \"exerted themselves\"\r\nand the girls \"worked with the devotion of soldiers.\" I thought of a\r\nmotto written by the Empress, which I had seen at Ueda, \"It is my wish\r\nthat the girls whose service it is to spin silk shall be always\r\ndiligent.\" Behind the desk of this factory proprietor hung the motto,\r\n\"Cultivate virtues and be righteous.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth factory I saw seemed to be staffed entirely with\r\napprentices who were turned over to other factories in their third\r\nyear. The girls appeared to have to sleep three girls to two mats. In\r\nthe event of fire the dormitory would be a death-trap. I was told that\r\nthere was an entertainment or a \"lecture on character\" once a week.\r\nThe motto on the walls of this factory was, \"Learning right ways means\r\nloving mankind.\"\r\n\r\nI went over the factory which belonged to the largest concern in Japan\r\nand had 10,000 hands. The girls were looked after in well-ventilated\r\ndormitories by ten old women who slept during the day and kept watch\r\nat night. There was a fire escape. All sorts of things were on sale at\r\nwholesale prices at the factory shop, but for any good reason an exit\r\nticket was given to town. The dining-room was excellent. There was a\r\nhospital in this factory and the nurse in the dispensary summarised at\r\nmy request the ailments of the 35 girls who were lying down\r\ncomfortably: stomachic, 12; colds, 7; fingers hurt by the hot water of\r\nthe cocoon-soaking basins, 5; female affections, 4; nervous, 2; eyes,\r\nrheumatism, nose, lungs and kidneys, 1 each. The average wages in this\r\nfactory worked out at 60 yen for 9 months. The hour of beginning work\r\nwas 4:30 at the earliest. The factory stopped at sunset, the latest\r\nhour being 6:30. I was assured that of the girls who did not get\r\nmarried 70 per cent. renewed their contracts. A large enclosed open\r\nspace was available in which the girls might stroll before going to\r\nbed. The motto of the establishment was, \"I hear the voice of spring\r\nunder the shadow of the trees.\" In reference to the new factory\r\nlegislation the manager said that the hours of labour were so long\r\nthat it would be some time before 10 hours a day would be\r\ninitiated.[143] This factory and its branches were started thirty\r\nyears ago by a man who was originally a factory worker. Although now\r\nvery rich he had \"always refused to be photographed and had not\r\navailed himself of an opportunity of entering the House of Peers.\"\r\n\r\nI visited several factories the girls working at which did not live in\r\ndormitories but outside. At a winding and hanking factory which was\r\nairy and well lighted the hours were from 6 to 6. At a factory where\r\nthe hours were from 4:30 to 7 some reelers had been fined. Japanese\r\nChristian pastors sometimes came to see the girls, and on the wall of\r\nthe recreation room there were paper _gohei_ hung up by a Shinto\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nI got the impression that the girls in the factories at Kōfu in\r\nYamanashi prefecture were not driven so hard as those at the factories\r\nin the Suwas in Nagano. Someone said: \"However the Suwa people may\r\nexploit their girls, we are able, working shorter hours and giving\r\nmore entertainments, to produce better silk, for the simple reason\r\nthat the girls are in better condition. We can get from 5 to 10 per\r\ncent. more for our silk.\" A factory manager said that it would be\r\nbetter if the girls had a regular holiday once a week, but one firm\r\ncould not act alone. (The factories are working seven days a week,\r\nexcept for festival days and public holidays.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _kemban_, I was told in Yamanashi that many girls\r\nwent to the factories \"unwillingly by the instructions of their\r\nparents.\" It was also stated that the money paid to girls or their\r\nparents on their engagement was not properly a gratuity but an\r\nadvance. I heard that the police keep a special watch on _kemban_.\r\nThey would not do this without good reason.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[141] The times stated are those given to me in the factories. The\r\nquestion of overtime is referred to later in the Chapter.\r\n\r\n[142] Again the reader must be reminded of the rise in wages and\r\nprices (estimated on p. xxv). During the recent period of inflation,\r\nsilk rose to 3,000 yen per picul and fell to 1,300 or 1,400 yen. There\r\nhave been great fluctuations in the wages of factory girls. At the\r\nmost flourishing period as much as 25 yen per head was paid to\r\nrecruiters of girls. In this Chapter, however, it is best to record\r\nexactly what I saw and heard.\r\n\r\n[143] On the day on which I re-read this for the printers, I notice in\r\nan American paper that one of the largest employers of labour in the\r\nUnited States has just stated that he did not see his way to abolish\r\nthe twelve-hours' day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\"FRIEND-LOVE-SOCIETY'S\" GRIM TALE\r\n\r\nThe psychology of behaviour teaches us that [a country's] failures and\r\nsemi-failures are likely to continue until there is a far more\r\nwidespread appreciation of the importance of studying the forces which\r\ngovern behaviour.--SAXBY\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think that some of the factory proprietors are conscious that\r\nthey are taking undue advantage of their employees. These men are just\r\naverage persons at the ante-Shaftesbury stage of responsibility\r\ntowards labour.[144] Their case is that the girls are pitifully poor\r\nand that the factories supply work at the ruling market rates for the\r\nwork of the pitifully poor. Said one factory owner to me genially:\r\n\"Peasant families are accustomed to work from daylight to dark. In the\r\nsilk-worm feeding season they have almost no time for sleep. Peasant\r\npeople are trained to long hours. Lazy people might suffer from the\r\nlong hours of the factory, but the factory girls are not lazy.\"\r\n\r\nIt hardly needs to be pointed out that there is all the difference\r\nbetween a long day at the varied work of a farm, even in the trying\r\nsilk-worm season, and a long day, for nine or ten months on end,\r\nsitting still, with the briefest intervals for food, in the din and\r\nheat of a factory. Such a life must be debilitating. When it is added\r\nthat in most factories, in the short period between supper and sleep,\r\nand again during the night, the girls are closely crowded, no further\r\nexplanation is wanted of the origin of the tuberculosis which is so\r\nprevalent in the villages which supply factory labour.[145] There is\r\nno question that in the scanty moments the girls do have for an airing\r\nmost of them are immured within the compounds of their factories. A\r\nlarge proportion of the many thousands of factory girls[146] who are\r\nto be mothers of a new generation in the villages are passing years of\r\ntheir lives in conditions which are bad for them physically and\r\nmorally. It must not be forgotten that very many of the girls go to\r\nthe factories before they are fully grown. On the question of\r\nmorality, evidence from disinterested quarters left no doubt on my\r\nmind that the _morale_ of the girls was lowered by factory life. The\r\nLancashire factory girl goes home every evening and she has her\r\nSaturday afternoon and her Sunday, her church or chapel, her societies\r\nand clubs, her amusements and her sweetheart. Her Japanese sister has\r\nnone of this natural life and she has infinitely worse conditions of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to remember, however, that the Japanese factory girl\r\ncomes from a distance. She has no relatives or friends in the town in\r\nwhich she is working. But the plea that she would get into trouble if\r\nshe were allowed her liberty without control of any sort does not\r\nexcuse her present treatment. If the factories offered decent\r\nconditions of life not a few of the companies would get at their doors\r\nmost of the labour they need and many of the girls would live at home.\r\nIf the factories insist on having cheap rural labour then they should\r\ndo their duty by it. The girls should have reasonable working hours,\r\nproper sleeping accommodation and proper opportunities inside and\r\noutside the factories for recreation and moral and mental improvement.\r\nIt is idle to suggest that fair treatment of this sort is impossible.\r\nIt is perfectly possible.\r\n\r\nThe factory proprietors are no worse than many other people intent on\r\nmoney making. But the silk industry, as I saw it, was exploiting,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, not only the poverty of its girl\r\nemployees but their strength, morality, deftness[147] and remarkable\r\nschool training in earnestness and obedience. Several times I heard\r\nthe unenlightened argument that, if there were a certain sacrifice of\r\nhealth and well-being, a rapidly increasing population made the\r\nsacrifice possible; that, as silk was the most valuable product in\r\nJapan, and it was imperative for the development and security of the\r\nEmpire that its economic position should be strengthened, the\r\nsacrifice must be made. Nothing need be said of such a hopelessly\r\nout-of-date and nationally indefensible attitude except this: that it\r\nis doubtful whether any considerable proportion of the people\r\nconnected with the silk industry have felt themselves specially\r\ncharged with a mission to strengthen the economic condition of their\r\ncountry. They have simply availed themselves of a favourable\r\nopportunity to make money. That opportunity was presented by the cheap\r\nlabour available in farmers' daughters unprotected by effective trade\r\nunions, by properly administered factory laws or by public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII[148]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enterprise, the efficiency and the profits shown by the\r\nsericultural industry have been remarkable, and not a few of the\r\ncapitalists connected with it are personally public-spirited. But many\r\nwell-wishers of Japan, native-born and foreign, cannot help wondering\r\nwhat is the real as compared with the seeming return of the industry\r\nto a nation the strength of which is in its reservoir of rustic health\r\nand willingness. It is significant of the extent to which the\r\nfactories are working with cheap labour that, in a country in which\r\nthere are more men than women,[149] there was in about 20,000\r\nfactories 58 per cent. of female labour. If I stress the fact of\r\nfemale employment it is because in Japan nearly every woman\r\neventually marries. Enfeebled women must therefore hand on\r\nenfeeblement to the next generation.[150]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, in their present factory system, as in other\r\ndevelopments, insist on making for themselves all the mistakes that we\r\nhave made and are now ashamed of. In judging the Japanese let us\r\nremember that all our industrial exploitation of women[151] was not,\r\nas we like to believe, an affair as far off as the opening nineteenth\r\ncentury. I do not forget as a young man filling a newspaper poster\r\nwith the title of an article which recounted from my own observation\r\nthe woes of women chain makers who, with bared breasts and their\r\ninfants sprawling in the small coals, slaved in domestic smithies for\r\na pittance. And as I write it is announced that the head of the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation says that \"there is no necessity for trade\r\nunions,\" which are, in his opinion, \"inimical to the best interests of\r\nthe employers and the public.\" That is precisely the view of most\r\nJapanese factory proprietaries.\r\n\r\nThe trade union is not illegal in Japan, but its teeth have been drawn\r\n(1) by the enactment that \"those who, with the object of causing a\r\nstrike, seduce or incite others\" shall be sentenced to imprisonment\r\nfrom one to six months with a fine of from 3 to 30 yen; (2) by the\r\npower given to the police (_a_) to detain suspected persons for a\r\nsuccession of twenty-four hour periods, and (_b_) summarily to close\r\npublic meetings, and (3) by the franchise being so narrow that few\r\ntrade unionists have votes. During the six years of the War there were\r\nas many as 141,000 strikers, but a not uncommon method of these\r\nworkers was merely to absent themselves from work, to refrain from\r\nworking while in the factory, or to \"ca' canny.\" Nevertheless 633 of\r\nthem were arrested. When I attended in Tokyo a gathering of members of\r\nthe leading labour organisation in Japan it was discreetly named\r\nYu-ai-kai (Friend-Love-Society, i.e. Friendly Society). Now it is\r\nboldly called the Confederation of Japanese Labour. A Socialist\r\nLeague[152] and several labour publications exist. Workers assemble to\r\nsee moving pictures of labour demonstrations, and a labour meeting has\r\ndefied the police in attendance by singing the whole of the \"Song of\r\nRevolution.\" But crippled as the unions are under the law against\r\nstrikes and by the poverty of the workers, they find it difficult to\r\nattain the financial strength necessary for effective action. Many\r\nworkers are trade unionists when they are striking but their trade\r\nunionism lapses when the strike is over, for then the unions seem to\r\nhave small reason for existing. The head of the Federation of Labour\r\nlately announced that the number of trade unionists was only 100,000,\r\nor half what it was during the recent big strikes and it is doubtful\r\nwhether, even including the 7,000 members of the Seamen's Union, there\r\nare in Japan more than 50,000 contributing members of the different\r\nunions. But this 50,000 may be regarded as staunch.\r\n\r\nThe poverty-stricken unions certainly afford no real protection to the\r\ngirl workers, who form indeed a very small proportion of their\r\nmembers. And the Factory Law does little for them. A Japanese friend\r\nwho knows the labour situation well writes to me:\r\n\r\n\"According to the Factory Law, which came into force in the autumn of\r\n1916, 'factory employers are not allowed to let women work more than\r\ntwelve hours in a day.' (Article III, section 1.) But if necessary,\r\n'the competent Minister is entitled to extend this limitation to\r\nfourteen hours.' (Section 2.) As to night work the law says that\r\n'factory employers are not allowed to let women work from 10 p.m. to 4\r\na.m.' (Article IV.) If, however, there are necessary reasons, 'the\r\nemployers can be exempted from the obligation of the Article IV.'\r\n(Article V.) Article IX says that 'the employers are forbidden to let\r\nwomen engage in dangerous work.' But whether work is dangerous or not\r\nis determined by 'the competent Minister' (Article XI), who may or may\r\nnot be well informed. There is also Article XII, 'The competent\r\nMinister can limit or prohibit the work of women about to have\r\nchildren' and within three weeks after confinement. But anyone who\r\nenters factories may see women with pale faces because they work too\r\nsoon after their confinement.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you how far these provisions are enforced. I can only\r\nsay that I have not yet heard of employers being punished for\r\nviolating the Factory Law. Can it be supposed that employers are so\r\nhonest as never to violate the Factory Law? As to working hours, in\r\nsome factories they may work less than fourteen hours as the law\r\nindicates. In others they may work more, because 'there are necessary\r\nreasons.' This is especially true of the factories in the country\r\nparts. As 200 inspectors have been appointed, the authorities must by\r\nnow know the actual situation pretty well.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuwata, a former member of the Upper House, with whom I frequently\r\ndiscussed the labour situation, declares the Factory Law to be\r\n\"palpably imperfect and primitive.\" At the end of 1917 there were,\r\naccording to official figures, 99,000 female factory operatives under\r\nfifteen years of age and 2,400 under twelve. Some 20,000 of these\r\nchildren were employed in silk factories. What protection have they?\r\nBefore passing this page for the press I have shown it to a\r\nwell-informed Japanese friend and he says that he has never seen any\r\nnewspaper report of a prosecution under the Factory Law. Obviously a\r\nFactory Law under which no one is ever prosecuted is not\r\noperative.[153]\r\n\r\nIt is excellent that Japan has sent a large permanent delegation to\r\nSwitzerland to establish a system of liaison with the International\r\nLabour Office of the League of Nations. This company of young men will\r\nkeep the Japanese Government well informed. There is undoubtedly in\r\nJapan, under Western influence, a steady development of sensitiveness\r\nto working-class conditions and a rapid growth of modern social\r\nideas. But the Government and the Diet will not step out far in\r\nadvance of general opinion, the most will naturally be made by the\r\nauthorities and trade interests of bad factory conditions on the\r\nContinent of Europe and in some industries in the United States, and\r\nthe majority of a public which has been carefully nurtured in the\r\nbelief that a profitable industrialism is the great desideratum for\r\nJapan will not be restive. Real factory reform is not to be expected\r\nuntil an enlightened view is taken by Japanese in general of the\r\nexploitation of girls for any purpose. It is not in commercial human\r\nnature, Eastern or Western, that factory directors and shareholders\r\nshould forgo without a struggle the advantage of possessing cheaper\r\nand more subjected labour than their foreign rivals. Some influence\r\nmay be exerted in the right direction by the fact that those who are\r\nprofiting by cheap and docile labour may themselves be undersold\r\nbefore long by cheaper and still more docile labour in China.[154] And\r\nin 1922 Japan is under an obligation, accepted at the Washington\r\nLabour Conference, to stop women working more than eleven hours a day\r\nand to abolish night work. Meantime the labour movement makes\r\nprogress. It is significant that many of its leaders are under the\r\ninfluence of \"direct action\" ideas. They hope little from a Diet\r\nelected on a narrow franchise and supported by a strong Government\r\nmachine backed by the Conservative farmer vote. Although, however,\r\nthere does not seem to be as yet a junction between the labour\r\nmovement and the unions of the tenant farmers, who have their own\r\ninterests alone in view, the future may present unexpected\r\ndevelopments. As I write, the labour movement is conducting a trial of\r\nstrength with the great Mitsubishi and Kawasaki enterprises and is\r\npresenting a stronger front than it has yet done.\r\n\r\nThis Chapter would give an unfair impression of the relations of\r\ncapital and labour in Japan if it included no reference to the\r\nwell-intentioned efforts made by several large employers to improve\r\nthe conditions of working-class life and labour. Sometimes they have\r\nfollowed the example of philanthropic firms in Great Britain and\r\nAmerica. As often as not they have been inspired by old Japanese ideas\r\nof a master's responsibilities. Many leading industrials have believed\r\nand still believe that by the conservation and development of old\r\nideas of paternalism and loyalty the trade-union stage of industrial\r\ndevelopment may be avoided. This conviction was expressed to me by,\r\namong others, Mr. Matsukata, of the famous Kawasaki concern, who has\r\nmade generous contributions to \"welfare\" work. My own brief experience\r\nas an employer in Japan made me acquainted with some canons in the\r\nrelationship of employer and employed which have lost their authority\r\nin the West. Given wisdom on the part of masters, the prolonged\r\nbitterness which has marked the industrial development of the West\r\nneed not be repeated in Japan, but whether that wisdom will be\r\ndisplayed in time is doubtful. The Japanese commercial world has been\r\ncommendably quick to learn in many directions in the West. It will be\r\na serious reflection on the intelligence of the country if the lessons\r\nof the industrial acerbities of Europe and the United States should\r\nnot be grasped. Meantime it is a duty which the foreign observer owes\r\nto Japan to speak quite plainly of attempts as silly as they are\r\nuseless[155] to obscure the lamentable condition of a large proportion\r\nof Japanese workers, to hide the immense profits which have been made\r\nby their employers and to pretend that factory laws have only to be\r\nplaced on the statute book in order to be enforced. But if he be\r\nhonest he must also recognise the handicap of specially costly\r\nequipment[156] and of unskilled labour and inexperience under which\r\nthe Japanese business world is competing for the place in foreign\r\ntrade to which it has a just claim. Such conditions do not in the\r\nleast excuse inhumanity, but they help to explain it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[144] It is a chastening exercise to read before proceeding with this\r\nChapter an extract from Spencer Walpole's _History of England_, vol.\r\niii, p. 317, under the year 1832: \"The manufacturing industries of the\r\ncountry were collected into a few centres. In one sense the persons\r\nemployed had their reward: the manufacturers gave them wages. In\r\nanother sense their change of occupation brought them nothing but\r\nevil. Forced to dwell in a crowded alley, occupying at night a house\r\nconstructed in neglect of every known sanitary law, employed in the\r\ndaytime in an unhealthy atmosphere and frequently on a dangerous\r\noccupation, with no education available for his children, with no\r\nreasonable recreation, with the sky shrouded by the smoke of an\r\nadjoining capital, with the face of nature hidden by a brick wall,\r\nneglected by an overworked clergyman, regarded as a mere machine by an\r\navaricious employer, the factory operative turned to the public house,\r\nthe prize ring or the cockpit.\"\r\n\r\n[145] See Appendix XL.\r\n\r\n[146] Number of factory workers, a million and a half, of whom 800,000\r\nare females. For statistics of women workers, see Appendix XLI.\r\n\r\n[147] The Minister of Commerce has himself stated that the\r\nsericultural industry is rooted in the dexterity of the Japanese\r\ncountrywoman.\r\n\r\n[148] This section of the Chapter was written in 1921.\r\n\r\n[149] In Japan in 1918 there were, per 1,000, 505.2 men to 494.8\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[150] Of the workers under the age of fifteen in the 20,000 factories,\r\n82 per cent. were girls. The statistics in this paragraph were issued\r\nby the Ministry of Commerce in 1917.\r\n\r\n[151] For sketches of women and children (with a chain between their\r\nlegs) harnessed to coal wagons in the pits, see _Parliamentary\r\nPapers_, vol. xv, 1842. \"There is a factory system grown up in England\r\nthe most horrible that imagination can conceive,\" wrote Sir William\r\nNapier to Lady Hester Stanhope two years after Queen Victoria's\r\naccession. \"They are hells where hundreds of children are killed\r\nyearly in protracted torture.\" In Torrens's _Memoirs of the Queen's\r\nFirst Prime Minister_, one reads: \"Melbourne had a Bill drawn which\r\nwith some difficulty he persuaded the Cabinet to sanction, prohibiting\r\nthe employment of children _under 9 in any except silk mills_.\"\r\n\r\n[152] More than 200 books on Socialism were published in 1920.\r\n\r\n[153] For a declaration by Dr. Kuwata concerning bad food and\r\n\"defiance of hygienic rules,\" see Appendix XLII.\r\n\r\n[154] See Appendix XLIII.\r\n\r\n[155] See Appendix XLII.\r\n\r\n[156] In a pre-War publication of the United States Department of\r\nCommerce it was stated that the cost of cotton mills per spindle is in\r\nEngland _32s._, in the United States _44s._, in Germany _52s._, and in\r\nJapan _100s._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHERY AT AN AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CULTIVATION OF THE HILLSIDE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILWAY STATION \"BENTO\" BOX (OPEN) AND POT OF TEA WITH\r\nCUP. p. 110  The _bento_ box provides rice, meat, fish, omelette and\r\nassorted pickles; also paper napkin and _hashi_ (chop-sticks) and\r\n(between them) a toothpick.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM TOKYO TO THE NORTH BY THE\r\nWEST COAST\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\"THE GARDEN WHERE VIRTUES ARE CULTIVATED\"\r\n\r\n(FUKUSHIMA AND YAMAGATA)\r\n\r\nBOSWELL: If you should advise me to go to Japan I believe I should.\r\nJOHNSON: Why yes, Sir, I am serious.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of my journeys I went from Tokyo to the extreme north of Japan,\r\ntravelling up the west coast and down the east. Fukushima\r\nprefecture--in which is Shirakawa, famous for a horse fair which lasts\r\na week--encourages the eating of barley, for on the northern half of\r\nthe east coast of Japan there is no warm current and the rice crop may\r\nbe lost in a cold season. \"Officials of the prefecture and county,\"\r\nsomeone said to me, \"take barley themselves; enthusiastic _gunchō_\r\ntake it gladly.\"\r\n\r\nThe prefectural station, by selecting the best varieties of rice for\r\nsowing, had effected a 10 per cent. improvement in yield. In each\r\ncounty an official \"agricultural encourager\" had been appointed. The\r\nlectures given at the experiment station were attended by 18,000\r\npersons. The studious who listen to the lectures had formed an\r\nassociation that provided at the station a fine building where supper,\r\nbed, breakfast and lunch cost 30 sen. It contained a model of the Ise\r\nshrine with a motto in the handwriting of a well-known Tokyo\r\nagricultural professor, \"Difficulties Polish You.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some villagers,\" said a local authority, \"want to make the Buddhist\r\ntemple the centre of the development of village life. In several\r\nplaces agricultural products are exhibited at Shinto shrines. Farmers\r\noffer them out of a kind of piety, but the products are afterwards\r\ncriticised from a technical point of view. This is done on the\r\ninitiative of the villagers encouraged by the prefecture.\"\r\n\r\nHereabouts the winter work of the people, in addition to basket, rope\r\nand mat making, was paper making and smoothing out the wrinkles of\r\ntobacco.[157] A considerable number of people had emigrated to South\r\nAmerica. The principal need of the villages, it was stated, was money\r\nat less than the current rate of 20 per cent. In one place I found a\r\nfactory built on the side of a daimyo's castle.\r\n\r\nI was told of crops of _konnyaku_ which had made one man the second\r\nrichest person in the prefecture and had therefore qualified him for\r\nmembership in the House of Peers. (The House includes one member from\r\neach prefecture as the representative of the highest taxpayers of that\r\nprefecture.)\r\n\r\nDuring my journeys I picked up many odds and ends of information by\r\nwalking through the trains and having chats with country people. I was\r\nalso helped by county and prefectural agricultural officials who,\r\nhaving learnt of my movements, were kind enough to join me in the\r\ntrain for an hour or so. One head of an agricultural school which was\r\nfull up with students told me that there were already in Fukushima two\r\nprefectural and five county agricultural schools.\r\n\r\nOur train, half freight with a locomotive at each end, went over the\r\nbackbone of Japan through the usual series of snow shelters and\r\ntunnels. Having surmounted the heights we slid down into Yamagata. I\r\nshould properly write Yamagataken, which we cannot translate\r\nYamagatashire, for a _ken_ (prefecture) is made up of counties. There\r\nare eleven counties in Yamagataken.\r\n\r\nAlmost any sort of dwelling looks tolerable in August, but many of the\r\nhouses that first caught our attention must be lamentable shelters in\r\nwinter. Some farmers, I learnt, were \"in a very bad condition.\" We\r\ndropped from a silk and rice plateau and then to a region where the\r\nmain crop was rice. The bare hills to be seen in our descent were an\r\nappalling spectacle when it was realised how close was their relation\r\nto the disastrous floods of the prefecture. A man in the train had\r\nlost 10,000 yen by floods, a large sum in rural Japan. In two years\r\nthe prefecture had spent in river-bank repairs nearly a million yen. A\r\nflood some years ago did damage to the amount of 20 million yen. The\r\nprefecture had a debt of 60 million yen, chiefly due to havoc wrought\r\nby its big river. A yearly sum was spent on afforestation in addition\r\nto what was laid out by the State and by private individuals. A\r\nforestry association was trying to raise half a million yen for tree\r\nplanting. But the flooding of the plains was not the only water\r\ntrouble of the Yamagatans. In one district they had a stream which\r\ncontained solutions of compounds of sulphuric acid so strong that\r\ncrops fail for three years on ground watered from it. In other parts\r\nof the prefecture, however, farmers had the advantage, enjoyed in many\r\nparts of Japan, of being able to water from ammonia water springs.\r\n\r\nHereabouts I first noticed the device common to many districts of\r\nhaving on the roof of a cottage a water barrel, tub or cistern, ready\r\nto be emptied on the shingle roof when sparks fly from a burning\r\ndwelling. Sometimes the wooden water receptacles are wrapped round\r\nwith straw.\r\n\r\nIn the prefectural city of Yamagata I heard of a primary school which\r\nhad a farm and made a profit, also of four landowners who had engaged\r\nan agricultural expert for the instruction of their tenants. \"A very\r\ncertain crop\" round about the city was grapes. Some 25,000 persons\r\nyearly visited the prefectural 12 _-chō_ experiment station, which\r\nwithin a year had distributed to farmers 7,600 cyanided fruit trees\r\nand 80 bushels of special seed rice.\r\n\r\nNear the experiment station was a crematorium of ugly brick and\r\ngalvanised iron belonging to the city of Yamagata at which 1,000\r\nbodies were burnt in a year in furnaces heated with pine blocks. A\r\nselection might be made from four rates ranging from 35 sen to 5 yen.\r\nThe most expensive rate was for folk who arrived in Western-style\r\ncoffins.\r\n\r\nThe experiment station had another institution at its doors. This had\r\nto do not with the dead but with the living. Its name was \"The Garden\r\nwhere Virtues are Cultivated.\" The director of it was the father of\r\nthe agricultural expert of the prefecture. The garden, which was not a\r\ngarden, was a home for bad boys, or rather for thirty bad boys and one\r\nbad girl. The bad girl--the director, being a man of humanity, common\r\nsense and courage, thought it most necessary that there should be at\r\nleast one bad girl--acted as maidservant to the director. The bad boys\r\n\"maided\" themselves and the school. The lads were such as had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the police. They were being reformed in a somewhat\r\noriginal way by a somewhat original director.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day they had their cold bath, which was itself a break\r\nwith Japanese custom, for, though most Japanese have a nightly hot\r\nbath, they are content with a basin wash in the morning. Then the boys\r\n\"cleaned school.\" Next they were marched up one by one to a mirror and\r\nrequired to take a good look at themselves, in order, no doubt, to see\r\njust how bad they were. After this they were called on to \"give thanks\r\nto the Emperor and their ancestors.\" Finally came a half-hour lecture\r\non \"morality.\" It was considered that by this time the boys were\r\nentitled to their breakfast. For open-air labour they were sent to the\r\nexperiment station, but they had manual work also in their own school,\r\nwhere, among other things, they \"made useful things out of waste,\" the\r\nincome from which went to their families. On Sundays the master,\r\nthough he must be nearer sixty than fifty, fenced with every one of\r\nthe thirty boys in turn--no ordinary task, for Japanese fencing calls\r\nnot only for an eye and a hand, but for a muscular back. Some\r\nwholesome-looking young fellows, members of a young men's association,\r\nserved as volunteer masters and lived in the bare fashion that was so\r\ngood for the boys.\r\n\r\nThe director did not believe that bad boys were hopeless. He said that\r\nnot only the boys but their parents were better for the work done in\r\n\"The Garden where Virtues are Cultivated.\" He seemed to have become a\r\nsort of consulting expert to primary school-masters who were at a loss\r\nto know how to manage bad boys. Chastisement, as is well known, is\r\nunusual in Japanese schools. The director of the human _hortus\r\ninclusus_ confessed to me that though two of his boys whom he had\r\ncaught fighting might not have been separated without, in the Western\r\nphrase, \"feeling the weight of his hand,\" his heaviest punishment on\r\nother difficult occasions was the moxa.\r\n\r\nThe moxa brings us back to real horticulture. Moxa is _mogusa_ or\r\nmugwort. _Mogusa_ means \"burning herb.\" The moxa is a great\r\ntherapeutic agent in the Far East. A bit of the dried herb is laid on\r\nthe skin and set fire to as a sort of blister. From the application of\r\nthe moxa as a cure for physical ills to its application for the cure\r\nof bad boys is a natural step. One sees by the scars on the backs of\r\nnot a few Japanese that in their youth either their health or their\r\ncharacters left something to be desired. The moxa, then, is the rod in\r\npickle in \"The Garden where Virtues are Cultivated.\" But I think it is\r\nnot brought out often. A wrestling ring in a mass of sand thrown down\r\nin a yard, a harmonium, a blackboard for the boys to work their will\r\non, doors labelled \"The Room of Patience,\" \"The Room of Honesty,\" \"The\r\nRoom of Cleanliness\" and \"The Room of Good Arrangement,\" not to speak\r\nof a rabbit loping about the school premises--these and some other\r\ntouches in the management of the school spoke of an even stronger\r\ninfluence toward well-doing than the moxa. But even if the moxa should\r\nfail, the attention of the boys could always be drawn to the\r\ncrematorium.\r\n\r\nOne who knew the rural districts discoursed to me in this wise: \"The\r\nbest men are not numerous, but neither are the worst. I doubt whether\r\nthe desire to enjoy life is as strong in the Japanese as in the people\r\nof the West. Most farmers would no doubt be happy with material\r\ncomfort. Pressed as they have been by material needs, they have no\r\ntime to think. When they are easier, they may get something beyond the\r\nphysical. At present we must regard their material welfare as the most\r\nurgent thing.\" But a man standing by, who was also a countryman,\r\nstrongly dissented. \"Religion,\" he said, \"is not only important but\r\nfundamental.\"\r\n\r\nI have been received by more than one prefectural governor at eight in\r\nthe morning. His Excellency of Yamagata sets a good example by rising\r\nat five and by going to bed at nine. He told me that he thought the\r\nfarmer's chief lack was cheap money. Low interest and a long term\r\nmight convert into arable 25,000 acres of barren land in his\r\nprefecture. In the old days, as I knew, the farmers drove tunnels\r\nconsiderable distances for irrigation, but with modern engineering\r\nbetter results would be possible if money were available. As to the\r\nmisdeeds of the rivers, it might almost be said that every village was\r\nfeeling the need of embanking and of going to the source of loss by\r\nplanting trees in the hills. Beautiful forests of feudal period had\r\nbeen wasted in the early days of Meiji and the result was now plain.\r\n\r\nBut attention had to be given to the minds as well as the pockets of\r\nthe villagers. Families that were once reasonably content were now\r\ndiscontented. A livelihood was harder to get, taxation was heavier and\r\nthere was an increase in needs. Country people imagined townspeople to\r\nbe comfortably off, \"not realising how they were tormented.\" Villagers\r\nenvied townsmen their amusements. Some prefectures had forbidden the\r\n_Bon_ dance and had supplied nothing in its place. It was easy to see\r\nwhy farmers no longer applied themselves so closely to their calling\r\nand were wavering in their allegiance to country life. Healthful\r\namusements were necessary for those whose minds were not much\r\ndeveloped. Also, country people should be taught the true character of\r\ntown life, and that agriculture, though it might not yield the profit\r\nof commerce and industry, ensured a reasonably happy life in healthful\r\nplaces where physical strength could be enjoyed. The right kind of\r\nvillage libraries should be encouraged. Music might perhaps be forced\r\ninto competition with _saké_.\r\n\r\nA mental awakening by education was the final solution of the rural\r\nproblem, the Governor thought. Religion was also important for the\r\ndevelopment of the village. Believers not under the eyes of others\r\nwould avoid wrong-doing because watched by heaven. Lectures on\r\nagriculture and sanitation had a good influence when delivered by\r\npriests. Temples were often schools before the era of Meiji and so\r\npriests were socially active. Under the new dispensation the work was\r\ntaken out of their hands. So they had come to care little for the\r\naffairs of the world. But they were influential and the prefecture had\r\nasked for their help. The merits of many priests might not be\r\nconspicuous, but the number of them who were active was increasing and\r\nthe villagers deferred to them if they took any step.\r\n\r\nThe most hopeful thing in the villages was the awakening of the young\r\nmen: they were becoming \"sincere,\" a favourite Japanese word. For the\r\nmost part the credit societies were not efficient, but in one county\r\ncredit societies had lessened the business of the banks. The best way\r\nto furnish capital to farmers was out of the capital of their fellow\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nPossibly the girls of the villages were not making the same advance as\r\nthe boys. They did not go to their field labour willingly. Sometimes\r\nwhen a woman was asked by a neighbour on the road, \"Have you been\r\nworking on the farm?\" she would answer, \"No, I have been to the\r\ntemple.\" The host of women's papers had a bad effect. With regard to\r\nthe _habutae_ (silk goods) factories, there was a bright side, for\r\nthey gave work to the girls in winter, when they were idle \"and\r\ntherefore poor and sometimes immoral.\" On the other hand, factory\r\ngirls tended to become vain and thriftless and the stay-at-home girls\r\nwere inclined to imitate them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] See Appendix XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE \"TANOMOSHI\"\r\n\r\n(YAMAGATA)\r\n\r\nSociety is kept in animation by the customary and by sentiment.--MEREDITH\r\n\r\n\r\nSix feet of snow is common on the line on which we travelled in\r\nYamagata prefecture, and washouts are not infrequent. A train has been\r\nstopped for a week by snow. It was difficult to think of snow when one\r\nsaw groups of pilgrims with their flopping sun-mats on their backs.\r\nThe shrines on three local mountain tops are visited by 20,000 people\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nWe bought at railway stations different sorts of gelatinous fruit\r\npreparations. Most places in Japan have a speciality in the form of a\r\nfood or a curiosity that can be bought by travellers.\r\n\r\nIn the great Shonai plain, which extends through three counties, there\r\nare no fewer than 82,500 acres of rice and the unending crops were a\r\nsight to see. A great deal of the paddy land has been adjusted. In one\r\ncounty there is the largest adjusted area in Japan, 20,000 acres. When\r\none raises one's eyes from the waving fields of illimitable rice, the\r\ndominating feature of the landscape is Mount Chokai with his August\r\nsnow cap.\r\n\r\nThe three-storey hotel at which we stayed had been taken to pieces and\r\ntransported twenty miles. Such removal of houses to a more convenient\r\nor, in the case of an hotel, a more profitable site, is not uncommon.\r\nI sometimes patronised at Omori a large hotel on a little hill halfway\r\nbetween Yokohama and Tokyo, which had formerly been the prefectural\r\nbuilding at Kanagawa. In the hotel in which I was now staying I was\r\ninterested in the \"Notice\" in my room:\r\n\r\n1. A spitting-pot is provided. [Usually of bamboo or porcelain.]\r\n\r\n2. No towels are lent for fear of _trachoma_.[158] [The traveller in\r\nJapan carries his own towels, but a towel is a common gift on a\r\nguest's departure in acknowledgment of his tea money.]\r\n\r\n3. There is a table of rates. Guests are requested to say in which\r\nthey desire to be reckoned. [To the hotel proprietor, landlord or\r\nmanager when the visit of courtesy is paid on the guest's arrival.\r\nOtherwise a judgment is formed from the guest's clothes, demeanour and\r\nbaggage.]\r\n\r\n4. Please lock up your valuables or let us keep them. [There are no\r\nlocks on Japanese doors.]\r\n\r\n5. Railroad, _kuruma_, box-sledge or automobile charges on\r\napplication. [The box-sledge shows what the country is like in\r\nwinter.]\r\n\r\nIn conversations about local conditions I was told that \"landowners of\r\nthe middle grade\" were suffering from \"trying to keep up their\r\nposition.\" I remembered the song which may be rendered:\r\n\r\n        Would that my daughter\r\n        Were married to a middle farmer.\r\n        With two _chō_ of farm\r\n        And a _tan_ in the wood.\r\n        No borrowing; no lending;\r\n        Both ends meeting.\r\n        Visiting the temple by turns--\r\n        Someone must stay at home.\r\n        Going to Heaven sooner or later.\r\n        What a happy life!\r\n        What a happy life!\r\n\r\nTenants were rather well off because their standard of living was\r\nlower than that of owners. Economic conditions were improving in\r\nYamagata, but in the adjoining prefecture of Miyagi on the eastern\r\ncoast of Japan \"whole villages\" had gone to Hokkaido. Some poor\r\nfarmers were spending only 5 sen a day on food, the rest of what they\r\nate coming entirely from their own holdings. Some farmers said, \"If\r\nyou calculate our income, we are certainly unable to make a living,\r\nbut in some way or other we are able,\" which is what some small\r\nholders in many countries would say.\r\n\r\nI was told that a labourer's 5 _tan_ could be cultivated by working\r\nhalf days. Generally more was earned by labouring than could be gained\r\nfrom a small patch of land. But for half the year labourer's work was\r\nnot obtainable. My informant found small tenant labourers \"well off\"\r\nif both husband and wife had wages: \"they are able to buy a bottle of\r\n_saké_ in the evening.\" Their position was better than that of a small\r\npeasant proprietor.\r\n\r\nOne in a thousand of the families in a specified county slept in\r\nstraw. I heard of the payment of 20 to 25 per cent. to pawnbroker\r\nlenders.\r\n\r\nBut there is another way of borrowing. The plan of the _kō_ may be\r\nadopted. A _kō_--it is odd that it should so closely resemble our\r\nabbreviation \"Co.\"--is simple and effective. If a man is badly off or\r\nwants to undertake something beyond his financial resources, and his\r\nfriends decide to help him, they may proceed by forming a _kō_. A _kō_\r\nis composed of a number of people who agree to subscribe a certain sum\r\nmonthly and to divide the proceeds monthly by ballot, beginning by\r\ngiving the first month's receipts to the person to succour whom the\r\n_kō_ was formed. Suppose that the subscription be fixed at a yen a\r\nmonth and that there are fifty subscribers. Then the beneficiary--who\r\npays in his yen with the rest--gets 50 yen on the occasion of the\r\nfirst ingathering. Every month afterwards a member who is lucky in the\r\nballot gets 50 yen. The monthly paying in and paying out continue for\r\nfifty months and all the subscribers duly get their money back, with\r\nthe advantage of having had a little excitement and having done a\r\nneighbourly action.\r\n\r\nBut the _kō_, or _tanomoshi_, as I ought to call it, is not always the\r\ninnocent organisation I have described. There is a _tanomoshi_ system\r\nunder which, after member A, the beneficiary, has received the first\r\nmonth's subscriptions, the other members are open to receive bids for\r\ntheir shares. That is to say that, when the time comes round for the\r\nsecond paying out of 50 yen, member F, who happens to have become as\r\nmuch in need of ready money as A was, offers, if the month's moneys be\r\nhanded over to him, to distribute among the members sums up to 20 yen.\r\nJuly and December, when most people need ready money, are months in\r\nwhich a hard-up member of a _tanomoshi_ may sometimes offer to\r\ndistribute as much as 50 per cent. of what he receives. The result of\r\nsuch bidding for shares is that well-to-do members of a _tanomoshi_,\r\nwho are the last to draw their 50 yen, receive in addition to it all\r\nthe extra payments made by impoverished members who took their shares\r\nearlier. Benevolence in a _tanomoshi_ is not seldom a mask for avarice\r\nthat the law against usury cannot touch. In truth, the only virtuous\r\npart of a _tanomoshi_ may be the first sharing out to the person in\r\nwhose interest it was supposed to be started. It should be added,\r\nhowever, that there is a sort of _tanomoshi_ which has no particular\r\nbeneficiary and is merely a kind of co-operative credit society. In\r\none place I heard of a _tanomoshi_ that maintained a large fund for\r\nthe relief of orphans and the sick.\r\n\r\nIn many villages there were private or co-operative godowns for the\r\nstorage of rice against fire, rats and damp. Though the farmer who\r\nsends rice to such a store receives a receipt, it is not legally a\r\nmarketable document. Hence an improvement on this simple storage plan.\r\nI visited the premises of a company that could store more than 500,000\r\nbushels of rice, and I found purification by carbon bisulphide going\r\non. The receipts given by this company--\"certificated\" for large\r\nquantities and \"tickets\" for small--certify not only the quantity but\r\nthe quality of the rice, and are readily cashed. The storehouse owners\r\nwork under a licence, and they have the advantage that the buyer of\r\nthe receipts of non-licensed stores is not protected by the courts.\r\n\r\nIn the office of the company were samples of eleven market qualities\r\nof rice, and before them, by way of showing respect to the great food\r\nstaple, was set the _gohei_ of cut white paper seen in Shinto\r\nshrines. Outside the office, girl porters carried the bales of rice to\r\nand fro. Close to the store was a river in which some of the dusty,\r\nperspiring porters were washing and cooling themselves with a\r\nsimplicity to which Western civilisation is not yet equal. Opposite\r\nthem men were fishing by casting in draw nets from the shore just as\r\nin biblical pictures the apostles are represented as doing.\r\n\r\nThe company has a rice market where farmers were putting their\r\nbusiness in the dealers' hands. Each dealer has to deposit 5,000 yen\r\nwith the State. The dealer who buys rice from a farmer has better\r\npolishing machinery than the farmer possesses. Therefore he can give\r\nthe rice a more uniform appearance. By decreasing the weight of the\r\nrice during the polishing he gives it he is also able to lessen the\r\nsum payable for carriage and he has the value of the offal.\r\n\r\nIn order to visit farmers I rode some distance into the country.[159]\r\nThe village, which was of the Zen sect, was at work cleaning out and\r\nstraightening the stream which, as is usual in many villages, ran\r\nthrough the middle of it. I was impressed during my visit not only by\r\nthe readiness and intelligence with which my questions were answered\r\nbut by the good humour with which a stranger's inquiries concerning\r\npersonal matters was received. I had another thought, that I might not\r\nhave found a group of Western farmers so well informed about their\r\nfinancial position as these simple, primitively clad men.\r\n\r\nOur _kuruma_ route to and from the village had been through one great\r\ntract of well-adjusted rice fields. Adjustment was not difficult in\r\nthis region because half the land belongs to the Homma family, which\r\nhas given much study to the art of land-holding. For two centuries the\r\nclan by charging moderate rents and studying the interests of its\r\ntenants has maintained happy relations with them.\r\n\r\nFor many years a plan has been in operation by which 200 one-_tan_\r\npaddy-fields are cultivated by the agents or managers of the estate,\r\nby tenants selected by their fellow tenants for merit, by tenants\r\nchosen by the landlord for diligence and by others picked out because\r\nof their interest in agriculture. In order to increase the zest of\r\ncompetition the cultivators are divided into a black and a white\r\ncompany. The names of those who raise the most and best rice are\r\npublished in the order of their success, farm implements are\r\ndistributed as prizes, the clever cultivators are invited to the\r\nlandlord's New Year entertainment to the agents and managers, and at\r\nthat feast \"places of distinction are given.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also a system of rewarding the best five-years averages. A\r\ncompetition takes place between what are called \"dress fields\" because\r\nthose who get the best results from them receive a ceremonial dress\r\nbearing the inscription, \"Prosperity and Welfare.\" The honour of\r\nwearing these robes in the presence of their landlord at his annual\r\nfeast is valued by these simple countrymen.\r\n\r\nThrough the introduction by the landlord of horse labour and\r\nploughs--implements with which the farmers were formerly\r\nunacquainted--second cropping of part of the paddies has become\r\npossible. There is an elaborate system of \"progressive reduction\" and\r\n\"average reduction\" of rents in a bad season, by which, it was\r\nexplained, \"the industrious tenant enjoys a larger reduction than an\r\nidle one.\" \"Tenants are grouped in fives, which help one another in\r\ntheir work and in cases of misfortune.\" In their agreement with their\r\nlandlord, tenants promise that \"wrong-doing shall be mutually\r\nreprimanded and counsel shall be given one to another.\" \"Again, if a\r\ntenant falls ill, has his house burnt or meets with misfortune,\r\nassistance shall be given by his fellows.\" During the war with Russia\r\nthe following instructions were issued:\r\n\r\nThose enlisted in the army shall render their service at the cost of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThose who stay at home shall do their best, complying with the\r\nprinciples laid down by the Minister of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nRelatives of soldiers at the front shall be helped and sympathised\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nAll shall subscribe to war bonds as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAll shall practise thrift and economy in accordance with their social\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nMusical entertainments shall be given up for two years.\r\n\r\nMethods proved to be effective in cultivation shall be reported.\r\n\r\nIn the warm, cloudy days insects multiply rapidly. Think of your\r\nbrothers at the front, struggling against one of the mighty military\r\npowers of the world, and be ashamed to be vanquished by hordes of\r\ninsects or masses of vegetable growth in your fields. For the purpose\r\nof destroying insects an ample supply of oil is to be had at the\r\nexperimental farm, as during last year; and payment therefor may be\r\ndeferred until after harvest.\r\n\r\nA communication to agents and managers says: \"Comport yourselves in a\r\nway suitable to the dignity of an agent of the clan. Bear in mind the\r\nprivileges and favours you enjoy, and exert yourselves to requite\r\nthese favours. Respect the name and the coat-of-arms of the clan.\" In\r\nthe neighbourhood there are about a hundred families bearing the name\r\nof Homma.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] In the three years 1916-18 the percentage of conscripts\r\nsuffering from trachoma was 15.8.\r\n\r\n[159] For farmers' budgets, see Appendix XIII (end).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK AGAIN BY THE EAST COAST\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\"BON\" SONGS AND THE SILENT PRIEST\r\n\r\n(YAMAGATA, AKITA,[160] AOMORI, IWATE, MIYAGI, FUKUSHIMA\r\nAND IBARAKI)\r\n\r\nThe worst of our education is that it looks askance, looks over its\r\nshoulder at sex.--R.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nA village headman, encountered in the train just as we were leaving\r\nYamagata prefecture, gave me some insight into the life of his little\r\ncommunity. The fathers of two-score families were shopkeepers and\r\ntradesmen--- that is, tradesmen in the old meaning of the word. There\r\nwere also a few labourers. About two hundred and fifty families owned\r\nland and some of them rented additional tracts. Another sixty were\r\nsimply tenants. The poorer farmers were also labourers or artisans.\r\nMost of them were \"comfortable enough.\" There were, however, half a\r\ndozen people in the village who were helped from village funds. Of the\r\nmiddle-grade farmers \"it might be said that they do not become richer\r\nor poorer.\"\r\n\r\nThe headman had formed a society which sent its members to visit\r\nprefectures more developed agriculturally. This society had engaged an\r\ninstructor from without the prefecture and he had taught horse tillage\r\nand the management of upland fields and had made model paddies. Five\r\nstallions had been obtained and a simple adjustment of paddy-land had\r\nbeen brought about. As a result the rice yield had risen.\r\n\r\nThis headman had also had addresses delivered in the village for the\r\nfirst time. Further, after buying a number of books, he had visited\r\nall the villagers in turn and shown them the books and had said to\r\neach of them, \"I wish you to buy a book and, after reading it, to give\r\nit to the library.\" \"And,\" he told me, \"none of them objected.\" Soon a\r\nvaluable library came into existence.\r\n\r\nThis admirable functionary felt some satisfaction at having been able\r\nto abate the custom according to which the young men, with the tacit\r\npermission of their parents, had gone into the neighbouring town after\r\nharvest \"to visit the immoral women.\" \"They used to spend as much as 5\r\nyen,\" said our headman. He had started worthier forms of after-harvest\r\nrelaxation, and \"the cost of the amusement days is now only 50 or 60\r\nsen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we got on the main line again and pursued our way farther north,\r\nit was through even stouter snow shelters and through many tunnels.\r\nNot a few miserable dwellings were to be seen as we passed into Akita\r\nprefecture. We broke our journey after some hours' travelling to stay\r\nthe night at a rather primitive hot spring inn four or five miles up\r\nin the hills. A slight rain was falling. Four passengers at a time\r\nmade the ascent to the hotel, squatting on a mat in an old\r\ncontractor's wagon, pushed along roughly laid rails by two perspiring\r\nyouths in rain-cloaks of bark strips. At the inn, on going to the\r\nbath, I found therein a miscellaneous collection of people of both\r\nsexes from grandparents to grandchildren. One bather enlivened us by\r\nperformances on the flute, which, if a musical instrument must be\r\nplayed in a bath, seems as suitable as any. In this rambling inn there\r\nwere many farmers who, by preparing their own food and doing for\r\nthemselves generally, were holiday-making at bedrock prices.\r\n\r\nAs it was the _Bon_ season, when the spirits of the dead are supposed\r\nto return, I was a witness of the method adopted to help the ghosts to\r\nfind their old homes. At the top of a 30 or 40 ft. pole a lantern is\r\nfixed with a pulley. Fastened up beside the lantern is a bunch of\r\ngreen stuff, cryptomeria in many cases. The lantern is lighted each\r\nevening for a week. Having heard a good deal about the suppression of\r\n_Bon_ dances and songs I was interested when a fellow-guest began\r\ntalking about them. He had seen many _Bon_ dances and had heard many\r\n_Bon_ songs. There can be no doubt that there has been some\r\nunenlightened interference with the _Bon_ gathering. The country\r\npeople seem to be suffering from the determination of officialdom to\r\nmake an end of everything in country as well as town that may be\r\nconsidered \"uncivilised\" by any foreigner, however ill instructed. In\r\ntowns the sexes are not accustomed to meet, but country people must\r\nwork together; therefore they find it natural to dance and sing\r\ntogether. As to the _Bon_ songs, it is common sense that expressions\r\nwhich may be regarded as outrageous and indecent in a drawing-room may\r\nnot be so terrible on a hilltop among rustics used to very plain\r\nspeech and to easy recognition of natural facts that are veiled from\r\ntownspeople. My chance acquaintance at the inn recited a number of\r\n_Bon_ songs and next morning brought me some more that he had\r\nremembered and had been kind enough to write down. They merely\r\nestablished the fact that bucolic wit is as elemental in Japan as in\r\nother lands. Most of the songs had a Rabelaisian touch, some were\r\nnasty, but nearly all had wit. The following is an entirely harmless\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n        Mr. Potato of the Countryside\r\n        Got his new European suit.\r\n        But a potato is still a potato.\r\n        He took one and a half _rin_[161] out of his bag\r\n        And bought _amé_[162] and licked at it.\r\n\r\nHere are three others:\r\n\r\n        Tip-toe, tip-toe,\r\n        Creaks the floor.\r\n        Girl made prayer,\r\n        Dreading ghost.\r\n        But 'twas her lover\r\n        Who stealthily came.\r\n\r\n        Dancer, dancer,\r\n        Do not laugh at me.\r\n        My dance is very bad,\r\n        But I only began last year.\r\n\r\n        How thin a thin-legged man may be\r\n        If he does not take his _miso_ soup.[163]\r\n\r\nThe quality of these dramatic songs will be entirely missed if the\r\nreader does not bear in mind the mimetic skill of the amateur Japanese\r\ndancer and his power as a contortionist. Clever dancers often use\r\ntheir powers in a humorous pretence of clumsiness. Of the freer sort\r\nof songs I may quote two:\r\n\r\n        Never buy vegetables in Third Street,[164]\r\n        You'll lose 30 sen and your nose.\r\n\r\n        Onions from a basket hanging in the _benjo_[165]\r\n        Were cooked in _miso_[166] and given to a blind man,\r\n        But that chap was greatly delighted.\r\n\r\nSome of the other songs may be described, I suppose, as obscene, if\r\nobscene be, as the dictionary says, \"something which delicacy, purity\r\nand decency forbid to be exposed\"; but \"delicacy, purity and decency\"\r\nmust be considered in relation to climate, work and social usage. What\r\none feels about some critics of _Bon_ songs and dances is that they\r\nneed a course of _The Golden Bough_. Such an illustration as _Bon_\r\nsongs furnish of the moral and mental conditions from which country\r\nfolk must raise themselves is of value if rural sociology is a real\r\nthing. There is far too much theorising about the countryman and the\r\ncountrywoman, far too much idealising of them and far too much rating\r\nof them as clods. If country people of all lands are free-spoken let\r\nus be neither hypercritical nor hypocritical. A big gap seems to yawn\r\nbetween the paddy-field peasant in his breech clout and the immaculate\r\nclubman, but what difference is there between the savour of the\r\naverage _Bon_ song and of many a smoking-room jest which is not to the\r\ncredit of the peasant? At an inn in Naganoken a Japanese artist on\r\nholiday showed me his sketch book. Among his drawings was a\r\nrepresentation of a shrine festival which he had witnessed in a remote\r\nvillage. A festival car was being pushed by a knot of youths and by\r\nabout an equal number of young women and all of them were nude. But no\r\nenlightened person believes that either decency or morals depends on\r\nclothing, or would expect to find more essential indecency and\r\nimmorality in that village than in a modern city. What one would\r\nexpect to find would be marriages between physically well-developed\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nHow the race moves on is shown in the famous tale of a saintly Zen\r\npriest which I first heard in that little hill inn but was afterwards\r\nto see in dramatic form on the stage of a Tokyo theatre. An unmarried\r\ngirl in the village in which the priest's temple was situated was\r\nabout to have a child. She would not confess to her angry father the\r\nname of her lover. At last she attributed her condition to the greatly\r\nhonoured priest. Her father was astonished but he was also glad that\r\nhis daughter was in the favour of so eminent a man. So he went to the\r\npriest and said that he brought him good tidings: the girl whom he had\r\ndeigned to notice was about to have a child. The father went on to\r\nexpress at length his sense of obligation to the priest for the honour\r\ndone to his family. All the priest said in reply was, _So desuka_? (Is\r\nthat so?) Soon after the birth of the child the girl besought her\r\nfather to marry her to a certain young farmer. The father, proud of\r\nthe association with the priest, refused. Finally the girl told her\r\nparent that it was not the priest but the young farmer who was the\r\nfather of her child. The parent was aghast and chagrined as he\r\nrecalled the terms in which he had addressed the saintly man. He\r\nbetook himself at once to the temple and expressed in many words his\r\nfeelings of shame and deep contrition. The priest heard him out, but\r\nall he said was, _So desuka_?\r\n\r\nYamagata signifies \"shape of a mountain\" and Akita means \"autumn rice\r\nfield.\" Although Akita prefecture is mountainous there is a greater\r\nproportion of level land in it than in Yamagata. I find \"Rice, rice,\r\nrice\" written in my notebook. An agricultural expert gave me to\r\nunderstand that fifteen per cent. of the farmers were probably living\r\non rents or on the dividends of silk factories, that 55 or 60 per\r\ncent. were of the middle grade with an annual income of 300 yen, that\r\n25 or 30 per cent. had about 150 yen--the lowest sum on which a family\r\ncould be supported--and that there were 3 or 4 per cent. of farm\r\nlabourers who earned less than 150 yen. There had been much paddy\r\nadjustment and the prefecture was spending 300,000 yen a year for the\r\nencouragement of adjustment and the opening of new paddies. In the\r\ncase of newly opened fields, tenants had contracts, but ordinary\r\ntenancies were by word of mouth generation after generation. A great\r\ndeal of agricultural instruction was given by the prefecture, the\r\ncounties and the villages, and in 30 years the rice crop had been\r\ndoubled although the area had remained about the same. In order to\r\nsecure help in the work of rural amelioration a gathering of Buddhist\r\npriests and another of Shinto priests had been lectured to at the\r\nprefectural office. Nearly 300,000 yen had been spent in twelve months\r\non afforestation. The following year a special effort was to be made\r\nto spend 500,000 yen. A society raised young trees and sold them at\r\ncheap rates to farmers. Every young men's association in the\r\nprefecture had land and had planted trees. It was in Akita that I\r\nfirst saw peat in Japan. There are said to be 7,000 acres of it in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe prefecture of Aomori forms the northern tip of the mainland. Apart\r\nfrom its enormous forest area and the railroad stacks of sawn lumber,\r\nwhat caught my eye were the apple orchards and the number of farmers\r\non horseback or seated in wagons. Who that has been in Japan has not a\r\nmemory of narrow winding roads along which men and women and young\r\npeople are pulling and pushing carts? Here many farming folk rode. I\r\nwas told that Akita produced apples and potatoes to the value of a\r\nmillion yen each and that there were ten co-operative apple societies.\r\nMuch of the fruit went to Russia.\r\n\r\nHaving passed through the city of Aomori we started to come down the\r\neast coast. An agricultural authority said that the net profit of a\r\ndry farm, that is a farm without any paddy, was almost negligible.\r\nBecause of low prices, cattle keeping had decreased to half what it\r\nused to be. (The only cattle I saw from the train were on the road\r\nwith harness on their backs.) Only 18 yen could be got for a\r\ntwo-year-old; the Aomori cattle were indeed the cheapest in Japan. The\r\nexpert added, \"There are no buyers; only robbers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the dealers were not the only robbers. Boats came from Hokkaido\r\nand stole cattle from the prefecture to the number of a hundred a\r\nyear. Sometimes horses were taken too, but horse thefts were rare\r\n\"because you cannot kill a horse and sell it for meat.\" The average\r\nprice of a two-year-old not thus illicitly vended was 70 yen. (It was\r\na little less in the next prefecture of Iwate and in Hokkaido.) Half\r\nof the stallions belonging to the \"Bureau of Horse Politics\" of the\r\nMinistry of Agriculture were bought in Aomori.\r\n\r\nThe farmers by the lake that we passed on our way south were described\r\nas \"very poor,\" for their soil was barren and their climate bad. Their\r\ncrops were only a third of what could be raised in another part of the\r\nprefecture. The agriculture of all the prefectures through which I now\r\njourneyed south to Tokyo suffer from the cold temperature of the sea.\r\nThe east-coast temperature drops in winter to 7 degrees below\r\nfreezing.[167] \"Living is more and more difficult,\" said someone to\r\nme. \"The number of tenants increases because farmers get into debt and\r\nhave to sell their land. Millet and buckwheat are much eaten. Although\r\nthe temperature is 5 per cent. colder in Hokkaido, the people do worse\r\nhere because our soil is barren and there is no profitable winter\r\noccupation like lumbering. Only 10 per cent. of the rural population\r\nsave anything. In bad times 65 per cent. of the families get into\r\ndebt.\"\r\n\r\nAt Morioka in Iwate prefecture I visited the excellent higher\r\nagricultural college, where there were 300 students. The competition\r\nfor places, as at every educational institution in Japan, was keen.\r\nThe number who sat at the last entrance examinations--the average age\r\nwas twenty--was 317, of whom only 80 got in. There were 15 professors\r\nand 10 assistants. The charge to students was 300 yen for a year of\r\nten months. The annual cost of the college to the Government was\r\n70,000 yen. Of the foreign volumes among the 20,000 books in the\r\nlibrary 50 per cent. were German, 30 per cent. English and 20 per\r\ncent. American.\r\n\r\nAn apiary of a single skep in a roped-off enclosure was an\r\nillustration of unfamiliarity with bees. It seemed strange to find\r\nthat in this up-to-date and efficient institution the biggest\r\nimplement for cutting grass which was in use, a sickle of course, had\r\na blade no longer than 8 inches. Hung up at the back of a shed I\r\nnoticed a rusty scythe. When I tried to show what it could do it was\r\nsuggested that the implement was \"too heavy, too difficult and too\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\nIwate is the poorest of the northern prefectures, for bad weather so\r\noften comes when the rice is in flower. As many as 40 per cent. of the\r\npeople were just making ends meet. Another 40 per cent. were always\r\ndogged by poverty. Millet was the food of 10 per cent. of the farmers;\r\nmillet, salted vegetables and bean soup were the meagre diet of 5 per\r\ncent; the staple food of the remainder was barley and rice. There are\r\nfew temples in Iwate compared with the rest of Japan. \"Education is\r\nmore backward than in other prefectures,\" someone said. \"The farmers\r\nare not able. Too much _saké_ is drunk.\" Farmers come in to Morioka to\r\nsell charcoal and wood and I saw some of them turning into the _saké_\r\nshops.\r\n\r\nThere was talk in praise of millet. Though low socially in the dietary\r\nof Japan, it has merits. It withstands cold and even salt spray. It\r\nripens earlier than rice and so may sometimes be harvested before a\r\nspell of bad weather. It yields well, it will store for some time, its\r\ntaste is \"little inferior to rice and better than that of barley\" and\r\nit contains more protein than rice. It is cooked after slight\r\npolishing and the straw provides fodder. \"In the north-east, where\r\nmillet is most eaten,\" I was told, \"there are people who are 5 ft. 10\r\nins. to 6 ft. and there are many wrestlers.\" The seeds in the handsome\r\nheavy ears of millet are about the size of the letter O in the\r\nfootnote type of this book.\r\n\r\nIn the train a farmer who knew the prefecture spoke of _Bon_ songs\r\nand dances: \"The result of the action against them was not good. The\r\nmeeting of young men and women at the _Bon_ gatherings was in their\r\nminds half the year in prospect and half in retrospect. Bearing in\r\nmind the condition of the people, even the worst _Bon_ songs are not\r\nobjectionable. But when the people become educated some songs will be\r\nobjectionable.\"\r\n\r\nVisitors to a poor prefecture like Miyagi must be surprised to see so\r\nmuch adjusted paddy. There is more adjusted paddy in Miyagi than in\r\nany other prefecture. Some 90,000 acres have been taken in hand and a\r\nlarge amount of money has been spent. The work has been carried out\r\nlargely by way of giving wages to farmers during famine. A new tunnel\r\nbrought water to 6,000 acres. \"The bad climate of Miyagi cannot be\r\nmended,\" I was told; \"all that can be done is to seek for the earliest\r\nvarieties of rice, to sow early, to work as diligently as possible and\r\nto deal with floods by embanking the rivers and by tree planting.\" As\r\nmany as 7,000 people go from Miyagi to Hokkaido in a year. It seems to\r\npoint to a certain amount of fecklessness that 15 per cent. of them\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nOne man I spoke with during my journey south gave a vivid impression\r\nof the influence of young men's associations. \"Before they started,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the young men spent their time in singing indecent songs, in\r\ngambling, in talking foolishly, and twice or thrice a year in\r\nimmorality. A young widow has sometimes been at fault; the\r\nparents-in-law need her help and village sentiment is against her\r\nremarriage. The suppression of _Bon_ dances has done more harm than\r\ngood by keeping out of sight what used to be said and done\r\nopenly[168]. Two or three priests are active in this prefecture. Where\r\nthe Shinshu sect is strong you will find little divorce. But the\r\ninfluence of Buddhism has been stationary in recent years. There is\r\nsome action by missionaries of the Japanese Christian church, but the\r\nnumber of Christians among real rustics is very small.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sendai it was pleasant to see a prefectural office--or most of\r\nit--housed in a Japanese building instead of a dreadful edifice \"in\r\nWestern style.\" In feudal times the building was a school. Portraits\r\nof daimyos and famous scholars of the Sendai clan surround the\r\nGovernor's room, and adjoining it is the _tatami_-covered apartment in\r\nwhich the daimyo used to sit when he was present at the examinations.\r\nAmong the portraits is one of a retainer which was painted in Rome,\r\nwhere he had been sent on a mission of inquiry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCARECROW.--A SKETCH BY PROFESSOR NASU.]\r\n\r\nIn his scarecrow-making the Japanese farmer seems to have great faith\r\nin the Western-style cap, felt hat, or even umbrella, if he can get\r\nhold of one. Ordinarily, the bogey man has a bow with the arrow\r\nstrung. Occasionally a farmer seeks to scare birds by means of\r\nclappers which he places in the hands of a child or an old man who\r\nsits in a rough shelter raised high enough to overtop the rice. Now\r\nand then there is a clapper connected with a string to the farm-house.\r\nI have also seen a row of bamboos carried across a paddy field with a\r\nsquare piece of wood hanging loosely against each one. A rope\r\nconnecting all the bamboos with one another was carried to the\r\nroadway, and now and then a passer-by of a benevolent disposition, or\r\nwith nothing better to do, or, it may be, standing in some degree of\r\nrelationship to the paddy-field proprietor, gave the rope a tug. Then\r\nall the bamboos bent, and as they smartly straightened themselves\r\ncaused the clappers to give forth a sound sufficiently agitating to\r\nsparrow pillagers in several paddies.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Miyagi we were once more in Fukushima, with notes on which\r\nthis account of a trip to the north of Japan and back again began.\r\nThis time, instead of journeying by routes through the centre of the\r\nprefecture, as in coming north, or as in the visit paid to Fukushima\r\nin the Tokyo-to-Niigata journey, I travelled along the sea coast. When\r\nwe had passed through Fukushima we were in Ibaraki, a characteristic\r\nfeature of which is swamps. Drainage operations have been going on\r\nsince the time of the Shogunate. There is in this prefecture the\r\nbiggest production of beans in Japan, and we have come far enough\r\nsouth to see tea frequently. In the lower half of the prefecture we\r\nare in the great Kwanto plain, the prefectures in which are most\r\nconveniently surveyed from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[160] Some Yamagata notes and those relating to Akita are conveniently\r\nincluded in this Chapter, but these two prefectures are on the west\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[161] A _rin_ is the tenth part of a sen, which in its turn is a\r\nfarthing.\r\n\r\n[162] A kind of barley sugar.\r\n\r\n[163] Bean soup.\r\n\r\n[164] A street in Akita in which many prostitutes live.\r\n\r\n[165] Closet.\r\n\r\n[166] Bean paste.\r\n\r\n[167] The warm black current from the south flows up the east and west\r\ncoasts. Some distance north of Tokyo, the east-coast current meets the\r\ncold Oyashiro current from Kamchatka, and is turned off towards\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[168] See _A Free Farmer in a Free State_, pp. 173-4, for an account\r\nof the custom in Zeeland by which peasants preserved themselves from\r\nthe calamity of childless marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT TALK\r\n\r\nTrue religion is a relation, accordant with reason and knowledge, which\r\nman establishes with the infinite life surrounding him, and it is such as\r\nbinds his life to that infinity, and guides his conduct.--TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most instructive experiences I had during my rural journeys\r\noccurred one night when I was staying at a country inn. At a late hour\r\nI was told that the Governor of the prefecture was in a room overhead.\r\nI had called on him a few days before in his prefectural capital. He\r\nwas a large daimyo-like figure, dignified and courteous, but seemingly\r\nimpenetrable. There was no depth in our talk. His aloof and\r\nuncommunicative manner was deterring, but by this time I had learnt\r\nthe elementary lesson of unending patience and freedom from hasty\r\njudgment that is the first step to an advance in knowledge of another\r\nrace. I felt that I should like to know more about the man inside this\r\nExcellency. No one had told me anything of his life.\r\n\r\nNow that he was in the same inn with me it was Japanese good manners\r\nto pay him a visit. So I went upstairs with my travelling companion,\r\ntelling him on the way that we should not remain more than five\r\nminutes. We were wearing our bath kimonos. The Governor was also at\r\nhis ease in one of these garments. He was kneeling at a low table\r\nreading. We knelt at the other side, spoke on general topics, asked\r\none or two questions and began to take our leave. On this the Governor\r\nsaid that he would like very much to ask me in turn some questions. We\r\nspoke together until one in the morning, his Excellency continually\r\nexpressing his unwillingness for us to go. He spoke rapidly and with\r\nsuch earnestness that I was balked of understanding what he said\r\nsentence by sentence. The next day my companion wrote out a summary\r\nof what the Governor had said and I had tried to say in reply. As a\r\nbrief report of a talk of three hours' duration it is plainly\r\nimperfect. The artless account is of some interest, however, because\r\nit furnishes an impression at once of an engaging simplicity and\r\nsincerity in the Japanese character and of the pressure of Western\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"There have died lately my mother, my wife and one of my\r\ndaughters. Some of my officials come to me and ask what consolation I\r\nam getting. What do I feel at first when such things happen? Am I\r\ncontent under such misfortune? I feel that I should be happy if I\r\ncould believe something and tell it to them. I am tormented by the\r\nconflict of my scientific and religious feelings. How is the relation\r\nof science and religion in your mind? Are you tormented or are you\r\ncomposed and peaceful even when meeting such misfortune as mine?\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"It is certain that it is not well to torment ourselves, for\r\ngrief is loss.[169] As to science, it did not drive away religion.\r\nScience seeks after truth in all matters, but there are truths which\r\nare to be searched out through our feeling, conscience and instinct.\r\nReligion has to do with these truths. It is quite good for religion if\r\nall superstition, dogma and ignorance are cleared away by science.\r\nConcerning a future life, we are hampered in our thinking by our\r\ntraditions, prejudices, deep ignorance and poor mental strength and\r\ntraining; and much energy is needed in the world for present service.\r\nSome have thought of an immortality which is that a man's sincere\r\ninfluence, his unselfish manifestations, those things which are the\r\nessence of a man's existence, will live on; in other words, that the\r\nbest of a life is immortal; but not in the way of ghosts. As to the\r\nmemory, example and achievement of the dead it is sure that we are\r\naided by them.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"If we sacrifice ourselves for the public good it is the\r\nbest that we can do in this world. But are you composed at the sad\r\nnews concerning the _Lusitania_? If you think that event was directed\r\nby divine destiny then you can be composed and may not complain.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"Such an accident may only be by divine destiny in the sense\r\nthat everything in this world, the saddest misery, the greatest\r\nmisfortunes, are suffered in the development of mankind, so that even\r\nthis War is unquestionably for the final betterment of the whole\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"Please say what is God.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"'If I could tell you what God is, I should be God myself.'\r\nMany of my own countrymen have been taught that God is 'Spirit,\r\ninfinite, eternal, unchangeable in His Being, wisdom, power, holiness,\r\njustice, goodness and truth.' There are those who would say that God\r\nmay be the total developing or bettering energy, and that we are all\r\npart of God. Some people have a more personal conception of God, the\r\nsum of all goodness. May not his Excellency consider the peasant's\r\nidea of a Governor of a prefecture? The peasant's idea of a Governor\r\nis greater than that of any particular Governor. His Excellency's good\r\nworks are not done by himself alone, but by all the good energies\r\ninherent in the Governorship. Those energies are unseen but real. The\r\nJapanese army and navy triumphed by the virtue of the Emperor--by the\r\nvirtue of ideas.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"The thought of _Sensei_[170] is quite Oriental.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"All religions are from Asia.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"This world where stars move, flowers blossom and decay,\r\nspring and autumn come, and people are born and die is too full of\r\nmystery, but I can feel some intelligence working through it though\r\nincomprehensible.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"Alas, people will try to explain that\r\nincomprehensibleness.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"What you have said is what I have been accepting to this\r\nday. It satisfies my reason, but I feel in my heart something lacking.\r\nI seek for a warmer interpretation of the world, for a more heartfelt\r\nrelation with cosmos. Several of my officials themselves lost their\r\ndear children recently. They cannot with heart and brain accept their\r\nloss, and they ask my direction.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"In the New Testament one thing is taught, God is Love. We\r\ncan be composed if we feel that God is love. The Gospel of John is the\r\nmost tender story in the world.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"It may be difficult for all people to come to the same\r\npoint and agree altogether. We must solve a great problem by\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"We have opportunities of doing some good works in this\r\nlife. Therefore we must go on till we die and we must be content at\r\nbeing able to do something good, directly or indirectly, in however\r\nsmall measure. 'Earth is not as thou ne'er hadst been,' wrote an\r\nEnglishwoman poet of great scientific ability[171] who died while yet\r\na young woman.\"\r\n\r\n_Governor_: \"I think of Napoleon dying tormented on St. Helena, and\r\nthe peaceful attitude of Socrates though being poisoned by enemies.\r\nBut Socrates had done many good things, yet he was poisoned.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself_: \"Socrates had done what he could for his country and the\r\nworld, yet by his brave death he could add one thing more.\"[172]\r\n\r\nThe Governor said that he \"got comfort from our talk,\" but this did\r\nnot perfectly reassure me. The next evening, however, I found a\r\nparboiled Governor alone in the bath and he greeted me very warmly.\r\nWithout our interpreter we could say nothing that mattered, but we\r\nwere glad of this further meeting in the friendly hot water. It seemed\r\nthat our midnight talk would be memorable to both of us.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to copy out here the following dicta on religion and\r\nmorals which were delivered to me at various times during my journeys:\r\n\r\nA. \"The weakest deterrent influence among us is, 'It is wrong.' A\r\nstronger deterrent influence is, 'Heaven will punish you.' The\r\nstrongest deterrent influence of all is, 'Everybody will laugh at\r\nyou.'\"\r\n\r\nB. \"In Japan all religions have been turned into sentiment or\r\næstheticism.\"\r\n\r\nC. (_after speaking appreciatively of the ideas animating many\r\nJapanese Christians_): \"All the same I do not feel quite safe about\r\ntrusting the future of Japan to those people.\"\r\n\r\nD. \"We Japanese have never been spiritually gifted. We are neither\r\nmeditative and reflective like the Hindus nor individualistic like the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. Nevertheless, like all mankind we have spiritual\r\nyearnings. They will be best stirred by impulses from without.\"\r\n\r\nE. (_in answer to my enquiry whether a Quakerism which compromised on\r\nwar, as John Brights male descendants had done, might not gain many\r\nadherents in Japan_): \"Other sects may have a smaller ultimate chance\r\nthan Quakerism. One mistake made by the Quakers was in going to work\r\nfirst among the poorer classes. The Quakers ought to have begun with\r\nthe intellectual classes, for every movement in Japan is from the\r\ntop.\"\r\n\r\nF. \"You will notice what a number of the gods of Japan are deified\r\nmen. There is a good side to the earth earthy, but many Japanese seem\r\nunable to worship anything higher than human beings. The readiest key\r\nto the religious feeling of the Japanese is the religious life of the\r\nGreeks. The more I study the Greeks the more I see our resemblance to\r\nthem in many ways, in all ways, perhaps, except two, our lack of\r\nphilosophy and our lack of physical comeliness.\"\r\n\r\nG. \"As to uncomeliness there are several Japanese types. The refined\r\ntype is surely attractive. If many Japanese noses seem to be too\r\nshort, foreigners' noses seem to us to be too long. The results of\r\nintermarriage between Western people and Japanese who are of equal\r\nsocial and educational status and of good physique should be closely\r\nwatched.\"\r\n\r\nH. \"In our schools an hour or two a week is reserved for culture, but\r\nthe true spirit of culture is lacking. The Imperial Rescript on\r\neducation is very good moral doctrine, but the real life's aim of many\r\nof us is to be well off, to have an automobile, to become a Baron or\r\nto extend the Empire. We do not ask ourselves, 'For what reason?'\"\r\n\r\nI. \"I conduct certain classes which the clerks of my bank must attend.\r\nThe teaching I give is based on Confucian, Christian and Buddhist\r\nprinciples. I try to make the young men more manful. I constantly urge\r\nupon them that 'you must be a man before you can be a clerk.'\"\r\n\r\nJ. (_a septuagenarian ex-daimyo_): \"Confucianism is the basis of my\r\nlife, but twice a month I serve at my Shinto shrine and I conduct a\r\nBuddhist service in my house morning and evening. It is necessary to\r\nmake the profession that Buddha saves us. I do not believe in\r\nparadise. It is paradise if when I die I have a peaceful mind due to a\r\nfeeling that I have done my duty in life and that my sons are not bad\r\nmen. Unless I am peaceful on my deathbed I cannot perish but must\r\nstruggle on. Therefore my sons must be good. I myself strove to be\r\nfilial and I have always said to my sons, 'Fathers may not be fathers\r\nbut sons must be sons.'\"\r\n\r\nK. (_the preceding speaker's son expressing his opinion on another\r\noccasion_): \"My father as a Confucian is kind to people negatively. We\r\nwant to be kind positively because it is right to be kind. As to\r\nfilial obedience, even fathers may err; we are righteous if we are\r\nright. My father is a Shintoist because it is our national custom. He\r\nwants to respect his ancestors in a wide sense and he desires that\r\nJapan, his family and his crops may be protected.\"\r\n\r\nL. \"I wish foreigners had a juster idea about 'idols'. There is a\r\ndifference between frequenters of the temples believing the figures to\r\nbe holy and believing them to be gods. Every morning my mother serves\r\nbefore her shrine of Buddha but she does not believe our Buddha to be\r\nGod. She would not soil or irreverently handle our Buddha, but it is\r\nonly holy as a symbol, as an image of a holy being. My mother has said\r\nto me, 'Buddha is our father. He looks after us always; I cannot but\r\nthank him. If there be after life Buddha will lead me to Paradise.\r\nThere is no reason to beg a favour.' My mother is composed and\r\npeaceful. All through her life she has met calamities and troubles\r\nserenely. I admire her very much. She is a good example of how\r\nBuddha's influence makes one peaceful and spiritual. But such\r\nreligious experience may not be grasped from the outside by\r\nforeigners.\"\r\n\r\nM. \"When I am in a temple or at a shrine I realise its value in\r\nconcentrating attention. The daily domestic service before the shrine\r\nin the house also ensures some religious life daily. Many of my\r\ncountrymen no doubt regard religion as superstition; they know little\r\nof spiritual life. For some of them patriotism or humanitarian\r\nsentiments or eagerness to seek after scientific truth takes the place\r\nof religion. Most men think that they can never comprehend the cosmos\r\nand say, 'We may believe only what we can prove. Let us follow not\r\nafter preachers but after truth.' I believe with your Western\r\nphilosophers who say that the cosmos is not perfect but that it is\r\nmoving towards perfection. Many think that this War shows that the\r\ncosmos is not perfect. Spiritual life is living according to one's\r\npurest consciousness. But what is of first importance is our actions.\r\nIt is not enough merely to strive after moral development. One must\r\nstrive after economic and social development. Some religious people\r\nthink only of the spiritual life and have no sympathy with economics.\r\nThe labours of such religious people must be of small value.\"\r\n\r\nIn later Chapters the views of other thoughtful Japanese are noted\r\ndown as they were communicated to me.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] \"The strength that is given at such times arises not from\r\nignoring loss or persuading oneself that the thing is not that _is_,\r\nbut from the resolute setting of the face to the East and the taking\r\nof one step forwards. Anything that detaches one, that makes one turn\r\nfrom the past and look simply at what one has to do, brings with it\r\nnew strength and new intensity of interest.\"--HALDANE.\r\n\r\n[170] Teacher, instructor, master, or a polite way of saying\r\n\"You\"--the usual title by which I was addressed.\r\n\r\n[171] Constance Naden.\r\n\r\n[172] \"The _Phaedo_ was bought for us by the death of\r\nSocrates.\"--QUILLER COUCH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLIND HEADMAN AND HIS COLLECTING-BAG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR.

Along the coast to the south,\r\nindeed as far as Hiroshima, there have been great gains from the sea,\r\nand in the neighbourhood of Kobe there are three parallel roads which\r\nmark successive recoveries of land. Before crossing the Inland Sea at\r\nOkayama to Shikoku (area about 1,000 square miles) I visited one of\r\nthe new settlements on recovered land. The labour available from a\r\nfamily was reckoned as equal to that of two men, and as much as 4 to 5\r\n_chō_ was allotted to each house. It will be seen how much larger is\r\nthis area--5 _chō_ is 12-1/2 acres--than the average Japanese farming\r\nfamily must be content with, a little less than 3 acres. The company\r\nsupplied houses, seeds, manures, etc., and after all expenses were met\r\nthe workers were allowed 25 per cent, of the net income of their\r\nsummer crop and 35 per cent, of the net income of their second crop.\r\nThe cultivation was directed by the company. There had been 300\r\napplications for the last twenty houses built. An experiment station\r\nwas maintained, and a campaign against a rice borer had been of\r\nbenefit to the amount of about 10,000 yen. I found the company's\r\nwinnowing machine discharging its chaff into the furnace of the\r\nrice-drying apparatus.\r\n\r\nOne of the experts of the company came with me for some distance in\r\nthe train in order to discuss some of his problems. He thought\r\nagricultural work could be done in less back-breaking ways. He wanted\r\na small threshing machine which would be suitable not only for\r\nthreshing small quantities of rice or corn but for easy conveyance\r\nalong the narrow and easily damaged paths between the rice fields. If\r\nhe had such a machine he would like to improve it so that it would lay\r\nout the threshed straw evenly, so making the straw more valuable for\r\nthe many uses to which it is put. He wished to see a machine invented\r\nfor planting out rice seedlings and another contrivance devised for\r\ndrying wheat. The company's rice-drying machine handled 200 _koku_ of\r\nrice a day, but there were difficulties in drying wheat. (In many\r\nplaces I noticed the farmers drying their corn by the primitive method\r\nof singeing it and thus spoiling it.)[173]\r\n\r\nOn the Inland Sea, aboard the smart little steamer of the Government\r\nRailways, my companion spoke of the extent to which sea-faring men, a\r\nconservative class, had abandoned the use of the single square sail\r\nwhich one sees in Japanese prints; the little vessels had been\r\nre-rigged in Western fashion. But many superstitions had survived the\r\nabolished square sails. The mother of my fellow-traveller once told\r\nhim that, when she crossed the Inland Sea in an old-style ship and a\r\nstorm arose, the shipmaster earnestly addressed the passengers in\r\nthese words, \"Somebody here must be unclean; if so, please tell me\r\nopenly.\" The title of the book my companion was reading was _The\r\nHistory of the Southern Savage_. Who was the \"Southern Savage\"? The\r\nword is _namban_, the name given to the early Portuguese and Spanish\r\nvoyagers to Japan. (The Dutch were called _komojin_, red-haired men.)\r\nIn looking through the official railway guide on the boat I saw that\r\nthere was a list of specially favourable places for viewing the moon.\r\nAn M.P. passenger told me that the average cost of getting returned to\r\nthe Diet was 10,000 yen[174].\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of communication in Shikoku are so considerable that\r\nI was compelled to leave the two prefectures of Tokushima and Kochi\r\nunvisited. Kochi is without a yard of railway line. In the prefecture\r\nof Ehime most of my journey had to be made by _kuruma_. Communication\r\nbetween the four prefectures of Shikoku--the one in which I landed was\r\nKagawa--is largely conducted by coasting steamers and sailing craft.\r\nAn interesting thing in Kochi is the area by the sea in which two\r\ncrops of rice are grown in the year. Tokushima holds a leading place\r\nin the production of indigo. At one place in the hills the adventurous\r\nhave the satisfaction of crossing a river by means of suspension\r\nbridges made of vine branches.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Takamatsu, the capital of Kagawa, are many of them so\r\nnarrow that the shopkeepers on either side have joint sun screens\r\nwhich they draw right across the thoroughfares. Here I found the carts\r\nhauled by a smallish breed of cow. The placid animals are handier in a\r\nnarrow place and less expensive than horses. They are shod, like their\r\ndrivers, in _waraji_. In Shikoku the cow or ox is generally used in\r\nthe paddies instead of the horse. \"It is slower but strong and can\r\nplough deep,\" one agricultural expert said. \"It eats cheaper food than\r\nthe horse, which moves too fast in a small paddy. Cows and oxen are\r\nprobably not working for more than seventy-five or eighty days in the\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nAt Takamatsu I had the opportunity of visiting a daimyo's castle. I\r\nwas impressed by its strength not only because of the wide moats but\r\nbecause of the series of earthen fortifications faced with cyclopean\r\nstonework through which an invading force must wind its way. There was\r\nwithin the walls a surprisingly large drilling ground for troops and\r\nalso an extensive drug garden. The present owner of the castle\r\nproposed to build here a library and a museum for the town. I was glad\r\nof the opportunity to ascend one of the high pagoda-like towers so\r\nfamiliar in Japanese paintings. I was disillusioned. Instead of\r\nfinding myself in beautiful rooms for the enjoyment of marvellous\r\nviews and sea breezes I had to clamber over the roughest cob-webbed\r\ntimbers. One storey was connected with another by a stair of rude\r\nplanking. Such pagodas were built only for their military value as\r\nlookouts and for their delightful appearance from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe town now enjoyed as a park of more than ten acres the grounds of a\r\nsubsidiary residence of the daimyo. The magnificent trees, with lakes,\r\nrivulets and hills fashioned with infinite art,[175] and the\r\nbackground of natural hill and woodland, made in all a possession\r\nwhich exhibited the delectable possibilities of Japanese gardening. An\r\noccasional electric light amid the trees gave an effect in the evening\r\nin which Japanese delight. Some of the old carp which dashed up to the\r\nbridges when they heard our footsteps seemed to be not far short of 3\r\nft. long.\r\n\r\nExcept for a small patch of sugar cane in Shidzuoka--it is grown\r\npractically on the sea beach where it is visible from the express--the\r\nvisitor to Japan may never see sugar cane until Shikoku is reached.\r\nThe value of the crop in the whole island is about 800,000 yen. The\r\ntall cane is conspicuous alongside the more diminutive rice. In this\r\nprefecture an experiment is being made in growing olives.\r\n\r\nKagawa is remarkable in having had until lately 30,000 pond reservoirs\r\nfor the irrigation of rice fields. Under the new system of rice-field\r\nadjustment many of the ponds are joined together. Because in Shikoku\r\nflat tracts of land or tracts that can be made flat are limited in\r\nnumber the farmers have to be content with small pieces of land. The\r\naverage area of farm in Kagawa outside the mountainous region is less\r\nthan two acres. When the farms are near the sea, as they commonly are,\r\nthe agriculturists may also be fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe number of place names ending in _ji_ (temple) proclaims the former\r\nflourishing condition of Buddhism. Shikoku is a great resort of\r\nwhite-clothed pilgrims. Sometimes it is a solitary man whom one sees\r\non the road, sometimes a company of men, occasionally a family. Not\r\nseldom the pilgrim or his companion is manifestly suffering from some\r\naffection which the pilgrimage is to cure. In the old days it was not\r\nunusual to send the victim of \"the shameful disease\" or of an\r\nincurable ailment on a pilgrimage from shrine to shrine or temple to\r\ntemple. He was not expected to return. In Shikoku there are\r\neighty-eight temples to Buddha and the founder of the Shingon sect,\r\nand it is estimated that it would mean a 760 miles' journey to visit\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nWe went off our route at one point where my companion wished to visit\r\na gorgeous shrine. A guidebook said that people flocked there \"by the\r\nmillion,\" but what I was told was that last year's attendance was\r\n80,000. The street leading to the approach to the shrine was in a\r\nseries of steps. On either side were the usual shops with piled-up\r\nmementoes in great variety and of no little ingenuity, and also, on\r\nspikes, little stacks of _rin_--the old copper coin with a square hole\r\nthrough the middle--into which the economical devotee takes care to\r\nexchange a few sen. We climbed to the shrine when twilight was coming\r\non. At the point where the series of street steps ended there began a\r\nnew series of about a thousand steps belonging to the shrine. A\r\nthousand granite steps may be tiring after a hot day's travel in a\r\n_kuruma_. All the way up to the shrine there were granite pillars\r\nalmost brand new, first short ones, then taller, then taller still,\r\nand after these a few which topped the tallest. They were\r\nconspicuously inscribed with the names of donors to the shrine. A\r\nsmall pillar was priced at 10 yen. What the big, bigger and biggest\r\ncost I do not know. I turned from the pillars to the stone lanterns.\r\n\"They burn cedar wood, I believe,\" said my companion. But soon\r\nafterwards I saw a man working at them with a length of electric-light\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nThe great shrine was impressive in the twilight. There was a platform\r\nnear, and from it we looked down from the tree-covered heights through\r\nthe growing darkness. Where the lights of the town twinkled there was\r\na subsidiary shrine. A bare-headed, kimono-clad sailor stepped forward\r\nnear us and bowed his head to some semblance of deity down there.\r\nVarious fishermen had brought the anchors of their ships and the oars\r\nof their boats to show forth their thankfulness for safety at sea. In\r\nthe murkiness I was just able to pick out the outlines of a bronze\r\nhorse which stands at the shrine, \"as a sort of scape-goat,\" my\r\ncompanion explained. \"It is probably Buddhist,\" he said; \"but you can\r\nnever be sure; these priests embellish the history of their temples\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at the inn in the evening that someone told me that in the town\r\nwhich is dependent on the shrine there were \"a hundred prostitutes,\r\nthirty geisha and some waitresses.\" Late at night I had a visit from a\r\nman in a position of great responsibility in the prefecture. He was at\r\na loss to know what could be done for morality. \"Religion is not\r\npowerful,\" he said, \"the schools do not reach grown-up people, the\r\nyoung men's societies are weak, many sects and new moralities are\r\nattacking our people, and there are many cheap books of a low class.\"\r\n\r\nNext day I laid this view before a group of landlords. They did not\r\nreply for a little and my skilful interpreter said, \"they are thinking\r\ndeeply.\" At length one of them delivered himself to this effect:\r\n\"Landowners hereabouts are mostly of a base sort. They always consider\r\nthings from a material and personal point of view. But if they are\r\nattacked and made to act more for the public good it may have an\r\neffect on rural conditions which are now low.\"\r\n\r\nI enquired about the new sects of Buddhism and Shintoism, for there\r\nhad been pointed out to me in some villages \"houses of new religions.\"\r\n\"New religions in many varieties are coming into the villages,\" I was\r\ntold, \"and extravagant though they may be are influencing people. The\r\nadherents seem to be moral and modest, and they pay their taxes\r\npromptly. There is a so-called Shinto sect which was started twenty\r\nyears ago by an ignorant woman. It has believers in every part of\r\nJapan. It is rather communistic.\"[176] None of the landlords who\r\ntalked with me believed in the possibility of a \"revival of Buddhism.\"\r\nOne of them noted that \"people educated in the early part of Meiji are\r\nmost materialistic. It is a sorrowful circumstance that the officials\r\nask only materialistic questions of the villagers.\"\r\n\r\nI asked one of the landlords about his tenants. He said that his\r\n\"largest tenant\" had no more than 1.3 _tan_ of paddy. It was explained\r\nthat \"tenants are obedient to the landowner in this prefecture.\" Under\r\nthe system of official rewards which exists in Japan, 1,086 persons in\r\nthe prefecture had been \"rewarded\" by a kind of certificate of merit\r\nand nine with money--to the total value of 26 yen.\r\n\r\nWhen I drew attention to the fact that the manufacture of _saké_ and\r\n_soy_ seemed to be frequently in the hands of landowners it was\r\nexplained to me that formerly this was their industry exclusively.\r\nEven now \"whereas an ordinary shop-keeper is required by etiquette to\r\nsay 'Thank you' to his customer, a purchaser of _saké_ or _soy_ says\r\n'Thank you' to the shop-keeper.\"\r\n\r\nThe flower arrangement in my room in the inn consisted of an effective\r\ncombination of _hagi_ (_Lespedeza bicolor_, a leguminous plant\r\nwhich is grown for cattle and has been a favourite subject of Japanese\r\npoetry), a cabbage, a rose, a begonia and leaf and a fir branch.\r\n\r\nA landowner I chatted with in the train showed me that it was a\r\nserious matter to receive the distinction of growing the millet for\r\nuse at the Coronation. One of his friends who was growing 5 _sh=o_,\r\nthe actual value of which might be 50 or 60 sen, was spending on it\r\nfirst and last about 3,000 yen.\r\n\r\nI enquired about the diversions of landowners. It is easy, of course,\r\nto have an inaccurate impression of the extent of their leisure. Only\r\nabout 1 per cent, have more than 25 acres.[177] Therefore most of\r\nthese men are either farmers themselves or must spend a great deal of\r\ntime looking after their tenants. Still, some landowners are able to\r\ntake things rather easily. The landowners I interrogated marvelled at\r\nthe open-air habits of English landed proprietors. They were greatly\r\nsurprised when I told them of a countess who is a grandmother but\r\nthinks nothing of a canter before breakfast. The mark of being well\r\noff was often to stay indoors or at any rate within garden walls,\r\nwhich necessarily enclose a very small area. (Hence the fact that one\r\nobject of Japanese gardening is to suggest a much larger space than\r\nexists.) A good deal of time is spent \"in appreciating fine arts.\"\r\nCeremonial tea drinking still claims no small amount of attention. (In\r\nmany gardens and in the grounds of hotels of any pretensions one comes\r\non the ostentatiously humble chamber for _Cha-no-yu_.) No doubt there\r\nis among many landowners a considerable amount of drinking of\r\nsomething stronger than tea, and not a few men sacrifice freely to\r\nVenus. Perhaps the greatest claimant of all on the time of those who\r\nhave time to spare is the game of _go_, which is said to be more\r\ndifficult than chess. One cannot but remark the comparatively pale\r\nfaces of many landowners.\r\n\r\nAs we went along by the coast it was pointed out to me that it was\r\nfrom this neighbourhood that some of the most indomitable of the\r\nold-time pirates set sail on their expeditions to ravage the Chinese\r\ncoast. They visited that coast all the way from Vladivostock, now\r\nRussian (and like to be Japanese), to Saigon, now French. There are\r\nmany Chinese books discussing effectual methods of repelling the\r\npirates. In an official Japanese work I once noticed, in the\r\nenumeration of Japanese rights in Taiwan (Formosa), the naïve claim\r\nthat long ago it was visited by Japanese pirates! The Japanese\r\nfisherman is still an intrepid person, and in villages which have an\r\nadmixture of fishing folk the seafarers, from their habit of following\r\nold customs and taking their own way generally, are the constant\r\nsubject of rural reformers' laments.\r\n\r\nI spent some time in a typical inland village. The very last available\r\nyard of land was utilised. The cottages stood on plots buttressed by\r\nstone, and only the well-to-do had a yard or garden; paddy came right\r\nup to the foundations. Now that the rice was high no division showed\r\nbetween the different paddy holdings. I noticed here that the round,\r\ncarefully concreted manure tank which each farmer possessed had a\r\nreinforced concrete hood. I asked a landowner who was in a comfortable\r\nposition what societies there were in his village. He mentioned a\r\nsociety \"to console old people and reward virtue.\" Then there was the\r\nsociety of householders, such as is mentioned in Confucius, which met\r\nin the spring and autumn, and ate and drank and discussed local\r\ntopics \"with open heart.\" There were sometimes quarrels due to\r\n_saké_. Indeed, some villagers seemed to save up their differences\r\nuntil the householders' meeting at its _saké_ stage. At householders'\r\nmeetings where there was no _saké_ peace appeared to prevail. The\r\nhouseholders' meeting was a kind of informal village assembly. That\r\nassembly itself ordinarily met twice a year. There were in the\r\nvillage, in addition to the householders' organisation, the usual\r\nreservists' association, the young men's society and agricultural\r\nassociation. As to _kō_, from philanthropic motives my informant was a\r\nmember of no fewer than ten.\r\n\r\nMy host told me that he spent a good deal of time in playing _go_, but\r\nin the shooting season (October 15 to April 15) he made trips to the\r\nhills and shot pheasants, hares, pigeons and deer. In the garden of\r\nhis house two gardeners were stretched along the branches of a pine\r\ntree, nimbly and industriously picking out the shoots in order to get\r\nthat bare appearance which has no doubt puzzled many a Western student\r\nof Japanese tree pictures. Each man's ladder--two lengths of bamboo\r\nwith rungs tied on with string--was carefully leant against a pole\r\nlaid from the ground through the branches. Many of the well-cared-for\r\ntrees in the gardens and public places of Japan pass the winter in\r\nneat wrappings of straw.\r\n\r\nI visited a farm-house and found the farmer making baskets. When I was\r\nexamining the winnowing machine my companion reminded me smilingly\r\nthat when he was a boy he was warned never to turn the wheel of the\r\nwinnowing machine when the contrivance had no grain in it or a demon\r\nmight come out. There was a properly protected tank of liquid manure\r\nand a well-roofed manure house. The family bath in an open shed was of\r\na sort I had not seen before, a kind of copper with a step up to it.\r\nStraw rope about three-quarters of an inch in diameter was being made\r\nby the farmer's son, a day's work being 40 yds. At another farm a\r\nwoman showed me the working of a rough loom with which she could in a\r\nday make a score of mats worth in all 60 sen. From the farmer's house\r\nI went to the room of the young men's association and looked over its\r\nlibrary. I was impressed by the high level of civilisation which this\r\nvillage seemed to exhibit in essentials.\r\n\r\nWhen we continued our journey we saw two portable water wheels by\r\nmeans of which water was being lifted into a paddy. Each wheel was\r\nworked by a man who continually ascended the floats. The two men were\r\nable to leave their wheels in turn for a rest, for a third man was\r\nstretched on the ground in readiness for his spell. It seems that a\r\nman can keep on the water tread-mill for an hour. The two wheels\r\ntogether were lifting an amazing amount of water at a great rate. When\r\nthe pumping is finished one of these light water wheels is easily\r\ncarried home on a man's shoulders.\r\n\r\nFarther on I saw in a dry river bed a man sieving gravel in an\r\ningenious way. The trouble in sieving gravel is that if the sieve be\r\nfilled to its capacity the shaking soon becomes tiring. This man had a\r\nsquare sieve which when lying on the ground was attached at one side\r\nby two ropes to a firmly fixed tripod of poles. When the sieve was\r\nfilled the labourer lifted it far enough away from the tripod for it\r\nto be swinging on one side. Therefore when he shook the sieve he\r\nsustained a portion only of its weight.\r\n\r\nAs we rode along I was told that the largest taxpayer in the county\r\n\"does not live in idleness but does many good works.\" The next largest\r\ntaxpayer \"labours every day in the field.\" When I enquired as to the\r\nrecreations of moneyed men I was told \"travelling, _go_ and poem\r\nwriting.\"\r\n\r\nAs we rode by the sea a trustworthy informant pointed out to me an\r\nislet where he said the young men have the young women in common and\r\n\"give permission for them to marry.\" There is a house in which the\r\ngirls live together at a particular time and are then free from the\r\nattentions of the youths. Children born are brought up in the families\r\nof the mothers but there is some infanticide. In another little island\r\noff the coast there are only two classes of people, the seniors and\r\nthe juniors. Any person senior to any other \"may give him orders and\r\ncall him by his second name.\" (The surname comes first in Japanese\r\nnames.)\r\n\r\nOur route led us along the track of the new railway line which was\r\npenetrating from Kagawa into Ehime. Not for the first time on my\r\njourneys was I told of the corrupting influence exerted on the\r\ncountryside by the imported \"navvies,\" if our Western name may be\r\napplied to men who in figure and dress look so little like the big\r\nfellows who do the same kind of work in England. Although these\r\nnavvies were a rough lot and our ancient _basha_ (a kind of\r\nfour-wheeled covered carriage) was a thing for mirth, we met with no\r\nincivility as we picked our way among them for a mile or two. I was a\r\nwitness indeed of a creditable incident. A handcart full of earth was\r\nbeing taken along the edge of the roadway, with one man in the shafts\r\nand another pushing behind. Suddenly a wheel slipped over the side of\r\nthe roadway, the cart was canted on its axle, the man in the shafts\r\nreceived a jolt and the cargo was shot out. Had our sort of navvies\r\nbeen concerned there would have been words of heat and colour. The\r\nJapanese laughed.\r\n\r\nThe reference to our venerable _basha_ reminds me of a well-known\r\nstory which was once told me by a Japanese as a specimen of Japanese\r\nhumour. A _basha_, I may explain, has rather the appearance of a\r\nvehicle which was evolved by a Japanese of an economical turn after\r\nhearing a description of an omnibus from a foreigner who spoke very\r\nlittle Japanese and had not been home for forty years. The body of the\r\nvehicle is just high enough and the seats just wide enough for\r\nJapanese. So the foreigner continually bumps the roof, and when he is\r\nnot bumping the roof he has much too narrow a seat to sit on.\r\nSometimes the _basha_ has springs of a sort and sometimes it has none.\r\nBut springs would avail little on the rural roads by which many\r\n_basha_ travel. The only tolerable place for Mr. Foreigner in a\r\n_basha_ is one of the top corner seats behind the driver, for the\r\ntraveller may there throw an arm round one of the uprights which\r\nsupport the roof. If at an unusually hard bump he should lose his hold\r\nhe is saved from being cast on the floor by the responsive bodies of\r\nhis polite and sympathetic fellow-travellers who are embedded between\r\nhim and the door. The tale goes that a tourist who was serving his\r\nterm in a _basha_ was perplexed to find that the passengers were\r\ncharged, some first-, some second-and some third-class fare. While he\r\nclung to his upright and shook with every lurch of the conveyance this\r\nproblem of unequal fares obsessed him. It was like the persistent\r\n\"punch-in-the-presence-of-the-passengare.\" What possible advantage, he\r\npondered, could he as first class be getting over the second and the\r\nsecond class over the third? At length at a steep part of the road the\r\nvehicle stopped. The driver came round, opened the door, and bowing\r\npolitely said: \"Honourable first-class passengers will graciously\r\ncondescend to keep their seats. Second-class passengers will be good\r\nenough to favour us by walking. Third-class passengers will kindly\r\ncome out and push.\" And push they did, no doubt, kimonos rolled up\r\nthighwards, with good humour, sprightliness and cheerful grunts, as is\r\nthe way with willing workers in Japan.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[173] At Anjo agricultural experiment station I saw eighteen kinds of\r\nsmall threshing machines at from 13 to 18 yen. There were husking\r\nmachines of three sorts. A rice thresher was equal to dealing with the\r\ncrop of one _tan_, estimated at 2 _koku_ 4 _to_, in three hours.\r\n\r\n[174] See Appendix XLVI.\r\n\r\n[175] It is quite possible that the trees had also come into their\r\npositions artificially. There are no more skilful tree movers than the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\n[176] It has recently come into collision with the authorities.\r\nAnother sect with Shinto ideas was also started by a woman.\r\n\r\n[177] See Appendix XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\"SPECIAL TRIBES\"\r\n\r\n(EHIME)\r\n\r\nA frank basis of reality.--Meredith\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prefecture of Ehime our journey was still by _basha_ or\r\n_kuruma_ and near the sea. The first man we talked with was a _gunchō_\r\nwho said that \"more than half the villages contained a strong\r\ncharacter who can lead.\" He told us of one of the new religions which\r\ntaught its adherents to do some good deed secretly. The people who\r\naccepted this religion mended roads, cleaned out ponds and made\r\nofferings at the graves of persons whose names were forgotten. I think\r\nit was this man who used the phrase, \"There is a shortage of\r\nreligions.\"\r\n\r\nI had not before noticed wax trees. They are slighter than apple\r\ntrees, but often occupy about the same space as the old-fashioned\r\nstandard apple. The clusters of berries have some resemblance to\r\nelderberries and would turn black if they were not picked green.[178]\r\nOccasionally we saw fine camphor trees. Alas, owing to the high price\r\nof camphor, some beautiful specimens near shrines, where they were as\r\nimposing as cryptomeria, had been sacrificed.\r\n\r\nI began to observe the dreadful destruction wrought in the early ear\r\nstage of rice not by cold but by wind. The wind knocks the plants\r\nagainst one another and the friction generates enough heat to arrest\r\nfurther development. The crops affected in this way were grey in\r\npatches and looked as if hot water had been sprayed over them. In one\r\ncounty the loss was put as high as 90 per cent. Happily farmers\r\ngenerally sow several sorts of rice. Therefore paddies come into ear\r\nat different times.\r\n\r\nThe heads of millet and the threshed grain of other upland crops were\r\ndrying on mats by the roadside, for in the areas where land is so much\r\nin demand there is no other space available. Sesame, not unlike\r\nsnapdragon gone to seed, only stronger in build, was set against the\r\nhouses. On the growing crops on the uplands dead stalks and chopped\r\nstraw were being used as mulch.\r\n\r\nI noticed that implements seemed always to be well housed and to be\r\nput away clean. Handcarts, boats and the stacks of poles used in\r\nmaking frameworks for drying rice were protected from the weather by\r\nbeing thatched over.\r\n\r\nWe continued to see many white-clad pilgrims and everywhere touring\r\nstudents, as often afoot as on bicycles. I noted from the registers at\r\nmany village offices that the number of young men who married before\r\nperforming their military service seemed to be decreasing. In one\r\ncommunity, where there were two priests, one Tendai and the other\r\nShingon, neither seemed to count for much. One was very poor, and\r\ncultivated a small patch near his temple; the other had a little more\r\nthan a _chō_. The custom was for the farmers to present to their\r\ntemple from 5 to 10 _shō_ of rice from the harvest.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of improved implements I noticed that\r\na reasonably efficient winnowing machine in use by a comfortably-off\r\ntenant was forty-nine years old--that is, that it dated back to the\r\ntime of the Shogun. The secondary industry of this farmer was\r\ndwarf-plant growing. He had also a loom for cotton-cloth making. There\r\nwere in his house, in addition to a Buddhist shrine, two Shinto\r\nshrines. After leaving this man I visited an ex-teacher who had lost\r\nhis post at fifty, no doubt through being unable to keep step with\r\nmodern educational requirements. He had on his wall the lithograph of\r\nPestalozzi and the children which I saw in many school-houses.\r\n\r\nOn taking the road again I was told that the local landlords had held\r\na meeting in view of the losses of tenants through wind. Most had\r\nagreed to forgo rents and to help with artificial manure for next\r\nyear. I found taro being grown in paddies or under irrigation. Not\r\nonly the tubers of the taro but its finer stalks are eaten. I saw\r\ngourds cut into long lengths narrower than apple rings and put out to\r\ndry. I also noticed orange trees a century old which were still\r\nproducing fruit. Boys were driving iron hoops--the native hoop was of\r\nbamboo--and one of the hoop drivers wore a piece of red cloth stitched\r\non his shoulder, which indicated that he was head of his class. One\r\nmissed a dog bounding and barking after the hoop drivers. Sometimes at\r\nthe doors of houses I noticed dogs of the lap-dog type which one sees\r\nin paintings or of the wolf type to which the native outdoor dog\r\nbelongs. The cats were as ugly as the dogs and no plumper or happier\r\nlooking. When I patted a dog or stroked a cat the act attracted\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWe saw a good deal of _hinoki_ (ground cypress), the wood of which is\r\nstill used at Shinto festivals for making fire by friction.\r\n\r\nWe were able to visit an Eta village or rather _oaza_. Whether the Eta\r\nare largely the descendants of captives of an early era or of a low\r\nclass of people who on the introduction of Buddhism in the seventh or\r\neighth century were ostracised because of their association with\r\nanimal eating, animal slaughter, working in leather and grave digging\r\nis in dispute. No doubt they have absorbed a certain number of\r\nfugitives from higher grades of the population, broken samurai,\r\nne'er-do-weels and criminals. The situation as the foreigner discovers\r\nit is that all over Japan there are hamlets of what are called\r\n\"special tribes.\" In 1876, when distinctions between them and Japanese\r\ngenerally were officially abolished, the total number was given as\r\nabout a million. Most of these peculiar people, perhaps three-quarters\r\nof them, are known as Eta. But whether they are known as Eta or Shuku,\r\nor by some other name, ordinary Japanese do not care to eat with them,\r\nmarry with them or even talk with them. In the past Eta have often\r\nbeen prosperous, and many are prosperous to-day, but a large number\r\nare still restricted to earning a living as butchers and skin and\r\nleather workers, and grave diggers. The members of these \"special\r\ntribes,\" believing themselves to be despised without cause, usually\r\nmake some effort to hide the fact that they are Eta.\r\n\r\nShuku seem to be living principally in hamlets of a score or so of\r\nhouses in the vicinity of Osaka, Kyoto and Nara, and are often\r\ntravelling players, or, like some Eta, skilled in making tools and\r\nmusical instruments. There seems to be a half Shuku or intermarried\r\nclass. Many prostitutes are said to be Shuku or Eta. I was told that\r\nmost of the girls in the prostitutes' houses of Shimane prefecture are\r\nfrom \"special tribes,\" and that they are \"preferred by the\r\nproprietors\" because, as I was gravely informed, \"they do not weary of\r\ntheir profession and are therefore more acceptable to customers.\" As\r\nprostitutes are frequently married by their patrons, it is believed\r\nthat not a few women from \"special villages\" are taken to wife without\r\ntheir origin being known. Unwitting marriage with an Eta woman has\r\nlong been a common motif in fiction and folk story. Many members of\r\nthe \"special tribes\" go to Hokkaido and there pass into the general\r\nbody of the population. The folk of this class are \"despised,\" I was\r\ntold by a responsible Japanese, \"not so much for themselves as for\r\nwhat their fathers and grandfathers did.\" The country people\r\nundoubtedly treat them more harshly than the townspeople, but a man of\r\nthe \"special tribes\" is often employed as a watchman of fields or\r\nforests. I was warned that it was judicious to avoid using the word\r\nEta or Shuku in the presence of common people lest one might be\r\naddressing by chance a member of the \"special tribes.\"\r\n\r\nExcept that the houses of the village we were visiting looked possibly\r\na trifle more primitive than those of the non-Eta population outside\r\nthe _oaza_, I did not discern anything different from what I saw\r\nelsewhere. The people were of the Shinshu sect; there was no Shinto\r\nshrine. At the public room I noticed the gymnastic apparatus of the\r\n\"fire defenders.\" The hamlet was traditionally 300 years old and one\r\nfamily was still recognised as chief. According to the constable, who\r\neagerly imparted the information, the crops were larger than those of\r\nneighbouring villages \"because the people, male and female, are always\r\ndiligent.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who was brought forward as the representative of the village\r\nwas an ex-soldier and seemed a quiet, able and self-respecting but sad\r\nhuman being. His house and holding were in excellent order. None of\r\nhis neighbours smiled on us. Some I thought went indoors needlessly; a\r\nfew came as near to glowering as can be expected in Japan. I got the\r\nimpression that the people were cared for but were conscious of being\r\n\"hauden doon\" or kept at arm's length.[179]\r\n\r\nOur next stop was for a rest in a fine garden, the effect of which was\r\nspoilt in one place by a distressing life-size statue of the owner's\r\nfather. When we took to our _kuruma_ again we passed through a village\r\nat the approaches to which thick straw ropes such as are seen at\r\nshrines had been stretched across the road. Charms were attached. The\r\nobject was to keep off an epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe indigo leaves drying on mats in front of some of the cottages were\r\na delight to the eye. There were also mats covered with cotton which\r\nlooked like fluffy cocoons. On the telegraph wires, the poles of which\r\nall over Japan take short cuts through the paddies, swallows clustered\r\nas in England, but it is to the South Seas, not to Africa, that the\r\nJapanese swallow migrates. When the telegraph was a newer feature of\r\nthe Japanese landscape than it is now swallows on the wires were a\r\nfavourite subject for young painters.\r\n\r\nWe crossed a dry river bed of considerable width at a place where the\r\ncurrent had made an excavation in the gravel, rocks and earth several\r\nyards deep. It was an impressive illustration of the power of a heavy\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nI found in one mountainous county that only about a sixth of the area\r\nwas under cultivation. A responsible man said: \"This is a county of\r\nthe biggest landlords and the smallest tenants. Too many landowners\r\nare thinking of themselves, so there arise sometimes severe conflicts.\r\nSome 4,000 tenants have gone to Hokkaido.\" The conversation got round\r\nto the young men's societies and I was told a story of how an Eta\r\nvillage threatened by floods had been saved by the young men of the\r\nneighbouring non-Eta village working all night at a weakened\r\nembankment. Some days later an Eta deputation came to the village and\r\n\"with tears in their eyes gave thanks for what had been done.\" The\r\ncomment of a Japanese friend was: \"In the present state of Japan\r\nhypocrisy may be valuable. The boys and the Eta were at least\r\nexercising themselves in virtue.\"\r\n\r\nFour villages in this county have among them eight fish nurseries, the\r\narea of salt water enclosed being roughly 120 acres. I looked into\r\nseveral cottages where paper making was going on.[180]\r\n\r\nI also went into two cotton mills. In both there were girls who were\r\nnot more than eleven or twelve. \"They are exempted from school by\r\nnational regulation because of the poverty of their parents,\"[181] I\r\nwas told.\r\n\r\nAs we passed the open shop fronts of the village barbers I saw that as\r\noften as not a woman was shaving the customer or using the patent\r\nclippers on him.\r\n\r\nWe looked at a big dam which an enterprising landowner was\r\nconstructing. Three hundred women were consolidating the earthwork by\r\nmeans of round, flat blocks of granite about twice the size of a\r\ncurling stone. Round each block was a groove in which was a leather\r\nbelt with a number of rings threaded on it. To each ring a rope was\r\nattached. When these ropes were extended the granite block became the\r\nhub of a wheel of which the ropes were the spokes. A number of women\r\nand girls took ropes apiece and jerked them simultaneously, whereupon\r\nthe granite block rose in the air to the level of the rope pullers'\r\nheads. It was then allowed to fall with a thud. After each thud the\r\npullers moved along a foot so that the block should drop on a fresh\r\nspot. The gangs hauling at the rammers worked to the tune of a\r\nplaintive ditty which went slowly so as to give them plenty of\r\nbreathing time. It was something like this:\r\n\r\n        Weep not,\r\n        Do not lament,\r\n        This world is as the wheel of a car.\r\n        If we live long,\r\n        We may meet again on the road.\r\n\r\nNone of the sturdy earth thumpers seemed to be overworked in the\r\nbracing air of the dam top, and they certainly looked picturesque with\r\ntheir white and blue towels round their heads. Indeed, with all the\r\nsinging and movement, not to speak of the refreshment stalls, the\r\nscene was not unlike a fair. When we got back to the road again we\r\npassed through a well-watered rice district which was equal to the\r\nproduction of heavy crops. Only three years before it had been covered\r\nby a thick forest in which it was not uncommon for robbers to lurk.\r\nThe transformation had been brought about by the construction of a dam\r\nin the hills somewhat similar to the one we had just visited.\r\n\r\nI could not but notice in this district the considerable areas given\r\nup to grave-plots. No crematoria seemed to be in use. There had been a\r\nnewspaper proposal that in areas where the population was very large\r\nin proportion to the land available for cultivation the dead should be\r\ntaken out to sea. Where land is scarce one sees various expedients\r\npractised so that every square foot shall be cropped. I repeatedly\r\nfound stacks of straw or sticks standing not on the land but on a\r\nrough bridge thrown for the purpose over a drainage ditch. In this\r\ndistrict land had been recovered from the sea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] For an account of a vegetable wax factory, see Appendix XLVIII.\r\n\r\n[179] For further particulars of Eta in Japan and America, see\r\nAppendix XLIX.\r\n\r\n[180] See Appendix L.\r\n\r\n[181] In 1918 net profits of 33 million yen were made by cotton\r\nfactories. The factories are anticipating sharp competition from\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE BLIND HEADMAN\r\n\r\n(EHIME)\r\n\r\nThe thing to do is to rise humorously above one's body which is the\r\nveritable rebel, not one's mind.--MEREDITH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is delightful to find so many things made of copper. Copper, not\r\niron, is in Japan the most valuable mineral product after coal.[182]\r\nBut there are drawbacks to a successful copper industry. Several times\r\nas I came along by the coast I heard how the farmers' crops had been\r\ndamaged by the fumes of a copper refinery. \"There are four copper\r\nrefineries in Japan, who fighted very much with the farmers,\" it was\r\nexplained. The Department of Agriculture is also the Department of\r\nCommerce and \"it was embarrassed by those battles.\" The upshot was\r\nthat one refinery moved to an island, another rebuilt its chimney and\r\nthe two others agreed to pay compensation because it was cheaper than\r\nto install a new system. The refinery which had removed to an island\r\nseven miles off the coast I had been traversing had had to pay\r\ncompensation as well as remove. I saw an apparatus that it had put up\r\namong rice fields to aid it in determining how often the wind was\r\ncarrying its fumes there. The compensation which this refinery was\r\npaying yearly amounted to as much as 75,000 yen. It had also been\r\ncompelled to buy up 500 _chō_ of the complaining farmers' land. When\r\nwe ascended by _basha_ into the mountains we looked down on a copper\r\nmine in a ravine through which the river tumbled. The man who had\r\nopened the original road over the pass had had the beautiful idea of\r\nplanting cherry trees along it so that the traveller might enjoy the\r\nbeauty of their blossoms in spring and their foliage and outlines the\r\nrest of the year. The trees had attained noble proportions when the\r\nrefinery started work and very soon killed most of them. They looked\r\nas if they had been struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nSome miles farther on, wherever on the mountain-side a little tract\r\ncould be held up by walling, the chance of getting land for\r\ncultivation had been eagerly seized. It would be difficult to give an\r\nimpression of the patient endeavour and skilful culture represented by\r\nthe farming on these isolated terraces held up by Galloway dykes.\r\nElsewhere the heights were tree-clad. In places, where the trees had\r\nbeen destroyed by forest fires or had been cleared, amazingly large\r\nareas had been closely cut over for forage. One great eminence was a\r\nwonderful sight with its whole side smoothed by the sickles of\r\nindomitable forage collectors. In some spots \"fire farming\" had been\r\nor was still being practised. Here and there the cultivation of the\r\nshrubs grown for the production of paper-making bark had displaced\r\n\"fire farming.\" I saw patches of millet and sweet potato which from\r\nthe road seemed almost inaccessible.\r\n\r\nOn the admirable main road we passed many pack ponies carrying immense\r\npieces of timber. Speaking of timber, the economical method of\r\npreserving wood by charring is widely practised in Japan. The\r\npalisades around houses and gardens and even the boards of which the\r\nwalls or the lower part of the walls of dwellings are constructed are\r\noften charred. The effect is not cheerful. What does have a cheerful\r\nand trim effect is a thing constantly under one's notice, the habit of\r\nkeeping carefully swept the unpaved earth enclosed by a house and\r\nbuildings as well as the path or roadway to them. This careful\r\nsweeping is usually regarded as the special work of old people. Even\r\nold ladies in families of rank in Tokyo take pleasure in their daily\r\ntask of sweeping.\r\n\r\nWhen we had crossed the pass and descended on the other side and taken\r\n_kuruma_ we soon came to a wide but absolutely dry river bed. The high\r\nembankments on either side and the width of the river bed, which,\r\nwalking behind our _kuruma_, it took us exactly four minutes to\r\ncross, afforded yet another object lesson in the severity of the\r\nfloods that afflict the country. The rock-and rubble-choked condition\r\nof the rivers inclines the traveller to severe judgments on the State\r\nand the prefectures for not getting on faster with the work of\r\nafforestation; but it is only fair to note that in many places\r\nhillsides were pointed out to me which, bare a generation ago, are now\r\ncovered with trees. Within a distance of twenty-five miles hill\r\nplantations were producing fruit to a yearly value of half a million\r\nyen. As for the cultivation on either side of the roadway, along which\r\nour _kurumaya_ were trotting us, I could not see a weed anywhere.\r\n\r\nA favourite rural recreation in Ehime, as in Shimane on the mainland,\r\nis bull fighting. It is not, however, fighting with bulls but between\r\nbulls: the sport has the redeeming feature that the animals are not\r\nturned loose on one another but are held all the time by their owners\r\nby means of the rope attached to the nose ring. The rope is gripped\r\nquite close to the bull's head. The result of this measure of control\r\nis, it was averred, that a contest resolves itself into a struggle to\r\ndecide not which bull can fight better but which animal can push\r\nharder with his head. That the bulls are occasionally injured there\r\ncan be no doubt. The contests are said to last from fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes and are decided by one of the combatants turning tail. There\r\nis a good deal of gambling on the issue. In another prefecture of\r\nShikoku the rustics enjoy struggles between muzzled dogs. A taste for\r\nthis sport is also cultivated in Akita. A certain amount of dog and\r\ncock fighting goes on in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nAt an inn there was an evident desire to do us honour by providing a\r\nspecial dinner. One bowl contained transparent fish soup. Lying at the\r\nbottom was a glassy eye staring up balefully at me. (The head,\r\nespecially the eye, of a fish is reckoned the daintiest morsel.) There\r\nwas a relish consisting of grapes in mustard. A third dish presented\r\nan entire squid. I passed honourable dishes numbers two and three and\r\ndrank the fish soup through clenched teeth and with averted gaze.\r\n\r\nI interrogated several chief constables on the absence of assaults on\r\nwomen from the lists of crimes in the rural statistics I had\r\ncollected. Various explanations were offered to me: if there were\r\ncases of assault they were kept secret for the credit of the woman's\r\nfamily; no prosecution could be instituted except at the instance of\r\nthe woman, or, if married, the woman's husband; women did not go out\r\nmuch alone; the number of cases was not in fact as large as might be\r\nimagined, because the people were well behaved. An official who had\r\nhad police experience in the north of Japan declared that the south\r\nwas more \"moral and more civilised and had higher tastes.\" In Ehime,\r\nfor example, there was very little illegitimacy and fewer children\r\nstill-born than in any other prefecture. Nevertheless four offences\r\nagainst women had occurred in villages in Ehime within the preceding\r\ntwelve months.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting stories of rural regeneration I heard was\r\ntold me by a blind man who had become headman of his village at the\r\ntime of the war with Russia. His life had been indecorous and he had\r\ngradually lost his sight, and he took the headmanship with the wish to\r\nmake some atonement for his careless years. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Although I thought it important to advance the economic condition of\r\nthe village it was still more important to promote friendship. As the\r\ninterests of landowners and tenants was the same it was necessary to\r\nbring about an understanding. I began by asking landowners to\r\ncontribute a proportion of the crops to make a fund. I was blamed by\r\nonly fourteen out of two hundred. But the landowners who did blame me\r\nblamed me severely, so much so that my family[183] were uneasy. I went\r\nfrom door to door with a bag collecting rice as the priests do. My\r\neccentric behaviour was reported in the papers. The anxiety of my\r\nhousehold and relatives grew. My children were told at the school that\r\ntheir father was a beggar. During the first harvest in which I\r\ncollected I gathered about 40 _koku_ (about 200 bushels). In the\r\nfourth year a hundred tenants came in a deputation to me. They said:\r\n'This gathering of rice is for our benefit. But you gather from the\r\nlandowners only. So please let us contribute every year. Some of us\r\nwill collect among ourselves and bring the rice to you, so giving you\r\nno trouble.' I was very pleased with that. But I did not express my\r\npleasure. I scolded them. I said: 'Your plan is good but you think\r\nonly of yourselves. You do not give the landowners their due. When you\r\nbring your rent to them you choose inferior rice. It is a bad custom.'\r\nI advised them to treat their landowners with justice and achieve\r\nindependence in the relation of tenant and landowner. They were moved\r\nby my earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"In the next year the tenants exerted themselves and the landowners\r\nwere pleased with them. Thus the relation of landlord and tenant\r\nbecame better. The landowners in their turn became desirous of showing\r\na friendly feeling toward the tenants. Some landlords came to me and\r\nsaid, 'If you wish for any money in order to be of service to the\r\ntenants we will lend it to you without interest.' I received some\r\nmoney. I lent money to tenants to buy manure and cattle, to attack\r\ninsect pests, to provide protection against wind and flood and to help\r\nto build new dwellings nearer their work. By these means the tenants\r\nwere encouraged and their welfare was promoted. The landlords were\r\nalso happier, for the rice was better and the land improved. The\r\nlandlords found that their happiness came from the tenants. There was\r\ngood feeling between them. The landlords began to help the tenants\r\ndirectly and indirectly. Roads and bridges and many aids to\r\ncultivation were furnished by the landlords. A body of landlords was\r\nconstituted for these purposes and it collected money. My idea was\r\nrealised that the way of teaching the villages is to let landlords and\r\ntenants realise that their interests agree and they will become more\r\nfriendly.\"\r\n\r\nThe co-operative credit society which the blind headman established\r\nnot only buys and sells for its members in the ordinary way but hires\r\nland for division among the humbler cultivators. One of the\r\ndepartments of the society's work is the collection of villagers'\r\nsavings. They are gathered every Sunday by school-children. One lad, I\r\nfound from his book, had collected on a particular Sunday 5 sen\r\neach--5 sen is a penny--from two houses and 10 sen each from another\r\ntwo dwellings. The next Sunday he had received 5 sen from one house,\r\n10 sen from two houses, 30 sen and 50 sen from others and a whole yen\r\nfrom the last house on his list. The subscriber gets no receipt but\r\nsees the lad enter in his book the amount handed over to him, and the\r\nnext Sunday he sees the stamp of the bank against the sum. Some 390\r\nhouseholders out of the 497 in the village hand over savings to the\r\nboy and girl collectors, whose energy is stimulated with 1 per cent.\r\non the sums they gather. In five years the Sunday collections have\r\namassed 60,000 yen. The previous year had been marked by a bad harvest\r\nand large sums had been drawn out of the bank, but there was still a\r\nsum of 14,000 yen in hand.\r\n\r\nIn this village there had been issued one of the economic and moral\r\ndiaries mentioned in an earlier chapter. The diary of this village has\r\ntwo spaces for every day--that is, the economic space and the moral\r\nspace. The owner of this book had to do two good deeds daily, one\r\neconomic and the other moral, and he had to enter them up. Further, he\r\nhad to hand in the book at the end of the year to the earnest village\r\nagricultural and moral expert who devised the diary and carefully\r\ntabulates the results of twelve months' economic and moral endeavour.\r\nOne might think that the scheme would break down at the handing in of\r\nthe diary stage, but I was assured that there were good reasons for\r\nbelieving that a considerable proportion of the 440 persons who had\r\ntaken out diaries would return them.\r\n\r\nThere is an old custom by which Buddhist believers, in companies of a\r\ndozen or so, meet to eat and drink together. As a good deal is eaten\r\nand drunk the gatherings are costly. Our blind headman met the\r\ndifficulty of expense in his village by getting the companies of\r\nbelievers to cultivate together in their spare time about three acres\r\nof land. His object was to associate religion and agriculture and so\r\nto dignify farming in the eyes of young men. He also wished to provide\r\nan object lesson in the results of good cultivation. The profits\r\nproved to be, as he anticipated, so considerable as to leave a balance\r\nafter defraying the cost of the social gathering. The headman\r\nprevailed on the cultivators to keep accurate accounts and they made\r\nplain some unexpected truths: as for example, that a _tan_ of paddy\r\ndid not need the labour of a man for more than twenty-three days of\r\nten hours, and that the net income from such an area was a little more\r\nthan 16 yen, and that thus the return for a day's labour was 73 sen.\r\nIt was demonstrated, therefore, that labour was recompensed very well,\r\nand that instead of farming being \"the most unprofitable of\r\nindustries\"--for in Japan as in the West there are sinners against the\r\nlight who say this--it was reasonably profitable.\r\n\r\nBut if rice called for only twenty-three days' labour per\r\n_tan_--nearly all the farmers' land was paddy--and the whole holding\r\nnumbered only a few _tan_, it was also plain that there were many days\r\nin the year when the farmer was not fully employed. From this it was\r\neasy to proceed to the conviction that the available time should be\r\nutilised either in secondary employments, or in, say, draining, which\r\nwould reduce the quantity of manure needed on the land. So the farmers\r\nbegan to think about drainage and the means of economising labour.\r\nThey began to realise how time was wasted owing to most farmers\r\nworking not only scattered, but irregularly shaped pieces of land. So\r\nthe rice lands were adjusted, and everybody was found to have a trifle\r\nmore land than he held before, and the fields were better watered and\r\nmore easily cultivated. Only from sixteen to seventeen days' labour\r\ninstead of twenty-three were now needed per _tan_[184] and the crops\r\nwere increased. There is now no exodus from this progressive village.\r\n\r\nConcerning his blindness the headman said that it was more profitable\r\nfor him to hear than to see, for by sight \"energy might be diverted.\"\r\nHe had recited in every prefecture his personal experience of rural\r\nreform. He asserted that while conditions varied in every prefecture,\r\nthere was, generally speaking, labour on the land for no more than 200\r\ndays in the year. He deplored the disappearance of some home\r\nemployments. He did not approve of the condition of things in the\r\nnorth where women worked as much in the fields as their husbands and\r\nbrothers. Women were \"so backward and conservative.\" The biggest\r\nobstacles to agricultural progress were old women. To introduce a\r\nsecondary industry was to take women from the fields.\r\n\r\nI spoke with an agricultural expert, one of whose dicta was that\r\n\"students at normal schools who come from town families are not so\r\nclever as students from farmers' families.\" He told me that 10,000\r\nyoung men in his county had sworn \"to act in the way most fitting to\r\nyouths of a military state [sic], to buy and use national products as\r\nfar as possible and so to promote national industry.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was wrong with some farming, according to an official of a county\r\nagricultural association whom I met later, was that the farmers\r\ncultivated too intensively. They used too much \"artificial.\" A\r\nprefectural official, speaking of the possibility of extending the\r\ncultivated area in Japan, said that in Ehime there were 6,000 _chō_\r\nwhich might be made into paddies if money were available. As to\r\nafforestation, 100,000 yen a year, exclusive of salaries, was spent in\r\nthe prefecture. As a final piece of statistics he mentioned that\r\nwhereas ten years before pears were grown only in a certain island of\r\nthe prefecture, the production of a single county was now valued at\r\nhalf a million yen yearly.\r\n\r\nI spent a night at a hot spring. It is said that the volume of water\r\nis decreasing. What a situation for a town which lives on a hot spring\r\nif the hot-water supply should suddenly stop! I heard of another\r\nhot-spring resort at which the water is gradually cooling: it is\r\nwarmed up by secret piping.\r\n\r\nI have not troubled my readers with many stories of the jostling of\r\npast and present, but I noticed in an electric street car at Matsuyama\r\na peasant trying to light his pipe with flint and tinder. As he did\r\nnot succeed a fellow-passenger offered him a match. He was so inexpert\r\nwith it that he still failed to get a light and he had to be handed a\r\ncigarette stump.\r\n\r\nIn riding down to the port in the street car I borrowed for a few\r\nmoments a schoolboy's English reader. It seemed rather mawkish. A book\r\nof Japanese history which I was also allowed to look at was full of\r\nreproductions of autographs of distinguished men. \"They make the\r\nimpression very strong,\" I was told.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[182] See Appendix XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n[183] That is, not only his household but his relatives.\r\n\r\n[184] Adding to the 17 days' labour for the rice crop, 13 days' labour\r\nfor the succeeding barley crop, the total was 30 days' labour per\r\n_tan_ against the general Japan average of 39 days per _tan_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH-WEST OF JAPAN\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nUP-COUNTRY ORATORY\r\n\r\n(YAMAGUCHI)\r\n\r\nI have confidence, which began with hope and strengthens with\r\nexperience, that humanity is gaining in the stores of mind.--MEREDITH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main street of an Inland Sea island we visited was 4 ft. wide.\r\nBecause it was the eve of a festival the old folk were at home\r\n\"observing their taboo.\" The islander who had been the first among the\r\ninhabitants to visit a foreign country was only fifty. The local\r\npoliceman made us a gift of pears when we left.\r\n\r\nAt another primitive island querns were in use and \"ordinary families\"\r\nwere \"only beginning to indulge in tombstones.\" In contrast with this,\r\nthe constable told us that a small condensed-milk factory had been\r\nstarted. (This constable was a fine, dignified-looking fellow, but so\r\npoor that his toes were showing through his blue cloth _tabi_.) The\r\ncondensed-milk factory must have been responsible for some surprises\r\nto the cows when they were first milked in its interests. I heard a\r\ntale of the first milking of an elderly cow. She had ploughed paddies,\r\ncarried hay and other things and had drawn a cart. But it took five\r\nmen and a woman to persuade her that to be milked into a clay pot was\r\na reasonable thing.\r\n\r\nThe third island we explored lies in such a situation in the Inland\r\nSea that sailing ships used to be glad to shelter under it while\r\nwaiting for a favourable wind. Someone had the evil thought of\r\nproviding it with prostitutes, and, until steam began to take the\r\nplace of sails, the number of these women established in the island\r\nwas large. Even now, although the whole population numbers only a\r\nhundred families, there are thirty women of bad character. These poor\r\ncreatures were conspicuous because of their bright clothing and\r\ndewomanised look. A scrutiny of the islanders old and young yielded\r\nthe impression that the whole place was suffering from its peculiar\r\ntraffic. There were two houses, one for registering the women and the\r\nother for investigating their state of health, and the purpose of the\r\nbuildings was bluntly proclaimed on the nameboards at their doors.\r\n\r\nWhen we got out to sea again the newest Japanese battleship doing her\r\ntrials was pointed out to me, but I was more interested in a large\r\nfishing boat running before the wind. A sturdy woman was at the helm\r\nand her naked young family was sprawling about the craft.\r\n\r\nSomeone spoke of villagers of the mainland \"failing to realise that\r\nthey now possessed the privilege of self-government.\" I was reminded\r\nof the pleasant way of the headman of a village assembly in the\r\nLoochoos, Japan's oldest outlying possession. He assembles or used to\r\nassemble his colleagues in his courtyard and appear there with a draft\r\nof proposed legislation. They bowed and departed and the Bill had\r\nbecome an Act.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were already within the territorial waters of Hiroshima\r\nprefecture, we determined not to make the mainland at once but to stay\r\nthe night at the famous island which is called both Miyajima (shrine\r\nisland) and Itsukushima (taboo island), and is considered to be one of\r\nthe three most noteworthy sights in Japan. Photographs and drawings of\r\nthe shrine with its red colonnades on piles by the shore and its big\r\nred _torii_ standing in the sea are as familiar as representations of\r\nFuji. It used to be the custom to prevent as far as possible births\r\nand deaths occurring on the island. Even now, funerals, dogs and\r\nkuruma are prohibited. The iron lanterns of the shrine and galleries\r\nand a hundred more in the pine tree-studded approaches are undoubtedly\r\n\"a most magnificent spectacle at full tide on a moonless night\"; but\r\nwhat of the subservience to the profitable foreign tourist seen in\r\nthis shrine notice?--\r\n\r\n_Zori_ (straw sandals), _geta_ (wooden pattens) and all footgear\r\n_except shoes and boots_ are forbidden.\r\n\r\nOne is attracted by the idea of listening to music and watching dances\r\nwhich came from afar in the seventh or eighth centuries, but the\r\nbusiness-like tariff,\r\n\r\n  Ordinary music, 12 sen to 5 yen,\r\n  Special music and dance, 10 yen and upwards,\r\n  Lighting all lanterns, 9 yen,\r\n\r\nis calculated to take one out of the atmosphere of Hearn's dreams. The\r\ndeities of the shrine get along as best they can with the raucous\r\nsirens of the tourist steamers, the din of the motor boats and the\r\nboom of the big guns which are hidden at the back of the island and\r\nmake of Miyajima and its vicinity \"a strategic zone\" in which\r\nphotography, sketching or the too assiduous use of a notebook is\r\nforbidden. Alas, I had myself arrived in a steamer which blew its\r\nsiren loudly, and in the morning I crossed from the holy isle to the\r\nmainland in a motor launch.\r\n\r\nThe name of Yamaguchi prefecture, which is at the extreme end of the\r\nmainland and has the sea to the south, the east and the north, is not\r\nso familiar as the name of its port, Shimoneseki. It was mentioned to\r\nme that the farmers of Yamaguchi worked a smaller number of days than\r\nin Ehime, possibly only a hundred in the year. The comment of my\r\ncompanion, who had visited a great deal of rural Japan, was that 150\r\nfull days' work was the average for the whole country.[185]\r\n\r\nI was told that here as elsewhere there was an unsound tendency to\r\nturn sericulture from a secondary into a primary industry. \"Experts\r\nare not always expert,\" confessed an official. \"Our farmers have had\r\nbitter experience. Experts come who have learnt only from books or in\r\nother districts, so they give unsuitable counsel. Then they leave the\r\nprefecture for other posts before the results of their unwisdom are\r\napparent.\"\r\n\r\nThe same official told me of a \"little famine\" in one county which had\r\nimprudently concentrated its attention on the production of grape\r\nfruit to the annual value of about a million yen. When a storm came\r\none spring there was almost a total loss. \"The river and the sea were\r\ncovered with fruit, fishing was interfered with, and the county town\r\ncomplained of the smell of the rotting fruit.\" It seems that many of\r\nthe suffering orange growers were samurai who found fruit farming a\r\nmore gentlemanly pursuit than the management of paddies. Like rural\r\namateurs everywhere, \"some of them would do better if they knew more\r\nabout the working of the land.\"\r\n\r\nRice was being assailed by a pest which survived in the straw stack\r\nand had done damage in the prefecture to the amount of 30,000 yen.\r\n\r\nIn this prefecture and two others during our tour my companion\r\ndelivered addresses to farmers under the auspices of the National\r\nAgricultural Association. The burden of his talk was their duty as\r\nagriculturists in the new conditions which were opening for the\r\nnation. His three audiences numbered about 700, 1,000 and 1,500. They\r\nwere composed largely of picked men. At the first gathering the\r\naudience squatted; at the next chairs were provided; at the third\r\nthere were school forms with backs. What I particularly noticed was\r\nthe easy-going way in which the meetings were conducted. No gathering\r\nbegan exactly at the time announced, although one of the audiences had\r\nbeen encouraged to be in time by the promise of a gift of mottoes to\r\nthe first hundred arrivals. At each meeting the Governor of the\r\nprefecture was the first speaker. At one meeting the Governor arrived\r\nabout 8.30 a.m., made his speech and departed. When my friend had been\r\nintroduced to various people in the anteroom, had drunk tea and had\r\nsmoked and chatted a little, he was taken to the platform half an hour\r\nor three quarters after the conclusion of the Governor's speech.\r\nNothing had happened at the meeting in the interval. The idea was that\r\nthe wait would help the audience's digestion of the speech it had had\r\nand the speech it was going to have. There was no formal introduction\r\nof the orator. He just mounted the platform and spoke for two hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOL SHRINE FOR EMPEROR'S PORTRAIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:cTHE AUTHOR ADDRESSING, THROUGH AN INTERPRETER, LAFCADIO\r\nHEARN DEATH-DAY MEETING AT MATSUE.]\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting the Governor awaited our arrival but \"went\r\non\" alone. The star speaker meanwhile refreshed himself in the\r\nanteroom with tea, tobacco and conversation as before. In a few\r\nminutes the Governor, having done his turn, rejoined us, and my friend\r\nproceeded to the meeting to deliver his speech, the Governor taking\r\nhis departure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PEASANT PROPRIETOR'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAVESTONES REASSEMBLED AFTER PADDY ADJUSTMENT.]\r\n\r\nAt the third meeting the Governor and the speaker of the day did enter\r\nthe hall together, but before the Governor had finished his\r\nintroductory harangue my companion took himself off to the anteroom to\r\nrefresh himself with a cigar and a chat. When the Governor concluded\r\nand returned to the anteroom there was conversation for a few minutes,\r\nand then my friend and his Excellency went into the meeting together.\r\nThis time the Governor stayed to the end.\r\n\r\nIn his three speeches my friend said many moving things and his\r\naudiences were appreciative. But no one presumed to interrupt with\r\napplause. At the end, however, there was a hearty round of\r\nhand-clapping, now a general custom at public gatherings. On the\r\nconclusion of each of his addresses the orator stepped down from the\r\nplatform and made off to the hall, for no one dreamt of asking\r\nquestions. When he was gone an official expressed the thanks of the\r\naudience and there was another round of applause. Then everybody\r\nconnected with the arrangement of the meeting gathered in the anteroom\r\nand one after the other made appreciative speeches and bows. I\r\nmarvelled at the orator's toughness. Before he went on the platform he\r\nhad been pestered with unending introductions and beset by\r\nconversation. But I do not know that my friend felt any strain. Nor\r\ndid the fashion in which the speakers wandered on and off the\r\nplatform, and thus, according to our notions, did their utmost to damp\r\nthe enthusiasm of the meetings, seem to have any such effect. Once in\r\nan oculist's consulting clinic in Tokyo I was struck by the fact that\r\nwhen water was squirted into the eyes of a succession of patients of\r\nboth sexes and various ages, they did not wince as Western people\r\nwould have done.\r\n\r\nI was told that school fees go up a little when the price of rice is\r\nhigh; also of the \"negatively good\" effects of young men's\r\nassociations. During the period of our tour efforts were being made to\r\nsystematise these organisations. The Department of Agriculture wanted\r\na farmer at the head of each society, the War Office an ex-soldier.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the militarists have been doing their best\r\nto give the societies the mental attitude of the army.\r\n\r\nIn the country we were entering, the horse had taken the place of the\r\nox as the beast of burden. Two men of some authority in the prefecture\r\nagreed that it was difficult to think of tracts in the south-west that\r\nwould be suitable for cattle grazing. There was certainly no \"square\r\n_ri_ where the price of land was low enough to keep sheep.\" As to\r\ncattle breeding and forestry, one of them must give way. It was\r\nnecessary to keep immense areas under evergreen wood for the defence\r\nof the country against floods. With regard to the areas available for\r\nafforestation, for cattle keeping and for cultivation respectively, it\r\nwas necessary to be on one's guard against \"experts\" who were disposed\r\nto claim all available land for their specialties.\r\n\r\nWhen we took to an automobile for the first stage of our long journey\r\nthrough Yamaguchi and Shimane--the railway came no farther than the\r\ncity of Yamaguchi--I noticed that just as the bridges are often\r\nwithout parapets, the roads winding round the cliffs were, as in\r\nFukushima, unprotected by wall or rail. This was due, no doubt, to\r\nconsiderations of economy, to a widely diffused sense of\r\nresponsibility which makes people look after their own safety, and\r\nalso, in some degree, to stout Japanese nerves. That our driver's\r\nnerves were sound enough was shown by the speed at which he drove the\r\nheavy car round sharp corners and down slippery descents where we\r\nshould have dropped a few hundred feet had we gone over.\r\n\r\nAt our first stopping-place I saw a photograph showing a Shinshu\r\npriest engaged with the girl pupils of a Buddhist school in tree\r\nplanting. Our talk here was about the low incomes on which people\r\ncontrive to live. A little more than a quarter of a century ago the\r\nfamily of a friend of mine, now of high rank, was living in a county\r\ntown on 5 yen a month! There were two adults and three children. Rent\r\nwas 1.20 yen and rice came to 1.80 yen. Even to-day an ex-Minister may\r\nhave only 1,500 yen a year. Many ex-Governors are living quietly in\r\nvillages. We went to call upon one of them who was getting great\r\nsatisfaction out of his few _tan_. Among other things he told us was\r\nthat there were five doctors and one midwife in the community. These\r\ndoctors do not possess a Tokyo qualification. They have qualified by\r\nbeing taught by their fathers or by some other practitioner, and they\r\nare entitled to practise in their own village and in, perhaps, a\r\nneighbouring one.\r\n\r\nIt was thoughtless of me, after inquiring about the doctors, to ask\r\nabout the gravedigger. I was told that when there was no member of a\r\n\"special tribe\" available it was the duty of neighbours to dig graves.\r\nA community's displeasure was marked by neighbours refraining from\r\nhelping to dig an unpopular person's grave. (One might have expected\r\nto hear that such a grave would be dug with alacrity.) Families which\r\nhad run counter to public opinion had had to \"apologise\" before they\r\ncould get neighbourly help at the burial of their dead.\r\n\r\nOnly one family in the village, I learnt from the headman, was being\r\nhelped from public funds. This family consisted of an old man and his\r\ndaughter, who, owing to the attendance her father required, could not\r\ngo out to work. The village provided a small house and three pints of\r\nrice daily. The headman in his private capacity gave the girl, with\r\nthe assistance of some friends, straw rope-making to do and paid a\r\nsomewhat higher price than is usual.\r\n\r\nOf last year's births in the village 10 per cent. had been legally and\r\n5 per cent. actually illegitimate. Four or five births had occurred a\r\nfew months after marriage.\r\n\r\nWe ate our lunch in the headman's room in the village office. Hanging\r\nfrom the ceiling was a sealed envelope to be opened on receipt of a\r\ntelegram. Some member of the village staff always slept in that room.\r\nThe envelope contained instructions to be acted upon if mobilisation\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone on some distance I stopped to watch a farmer's wife\r\nand daughter threshing in a barn by pulling the rice through a row of\r\nsteel teeth, the simple form of threshing implement which is seen in\r\nslightly different patterns all over Japan. (It is the successor of a\r\ncontrivance of bamboo stakes.) The women told me that one person could\r\nthresh fourteen bushels a day. The implement cost 2-1/2 yen from\r\ntravelling vendors but only 1-1/2 yen from the co-operative society.\r\nWhile we talked the farmer appeared. I apologised to him for\r\nunwittingly stepping on the threshold of the barn--that is, the\r\ngrooved timber in which the sliding doors run. It is considered to be\r\nan insult to the head of the house to tread on the threshold as in\r\nsome way \"standing on the householder's head.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had a bamboo plantation, and he told me, in reply to a\r\nquestion, that the bamboo would shoot up at the rate of more than a\r\nfoot in twenty-four hours. (During the month in which this is dictated\r\nI have measured the growth of a shoot of a Dorothy Perkins climber and\r\nfind that it averages about quarter of an inch in twenty-four hours.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] See Appendix XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMEN, DOGS AND SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\n(SHIMANE)\r\n\r\nNothing but omniscience could suffice to answer all the questions\r\nimplicitly raised.--J.G. FRAZER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we descended from the hills we were in Shimane, a long, narrow,\r\ncoastwise prefecture through which one travels over a succession of\r\nheights to the capital, Matsue, situated at the far end. Two-thirds of\r\nthe journey must be made on foot and by _kuruma_.[186] Some talk by\r\nthe way was about the farmers going five or six miles daily to the\r\nhills to cut grass for their \"cattle,\" the average number of cattle\r\nper farmer being 1.3 hereabouts. It seemed strange to see buckwheat at\r\nthe flowering stage reached by the crops seen in Fukushima several\r\nmonths before. The explanation was that buckwheat is sown both in\r\nspring and autumn.\r\n\r\nIn the old days notable samurai, fugitives from Tokyo, had kept\r\nthemselves secluded in the rooms we occupied at Yamaguchi. In Shimane\r\nwe had small plain low-ceiled rooms in which daimyos had been\r\naccommodated. Not here alone had I evidences of the simplicity of the\r\nlife of Old Japan.\r\n\r\nI was wakened in the morning by the voice of a woman earnestly\r\npraying. She stood in the yard of the house opposite and faced first\r\nin one direction and then in another. A friend of mine once stayed\r\novernight at an inn on the river at Kyoto. In the morning he saw\r\nseveral men and a considerable number of women praying by the\r\nwaterside. They were the keepers and inmates of houses of ill-fame.\r\nThe old Shinto idea was that prayers might be made anywhere at other\r\ntimes than festivals, for the god was at the shrine at festivals only.\r\nNowadays some old men go to the shrine every morning, just as many old\r\nwomen are seen at the Buddhist temples daily. Half the visitors to a\r\nShinto shrine, an educated man assured me, may pray, but in the case\r\nof the other half the \"worship\" is \"no more than a motion of respect.\"\r\nMy friend told me that when he prayed at a shrine his prayer was for\r\nhis children's or his parents' health.\r\n\r\nAt a county town I found a library of 4,000 volumes, largely an\r\ninheritance from the feudal regime. Wherever I went I could not but\r\nnote the cluster of readers at the open fronts of bookshops.[187]\r\n\r\nOn our second day's journey in Shimane I had a _kuruma_ with wooden\r\nwheels, and in the hills the day after we passed a man kneeling in a\r\n_kago_, the old-fashioned litter. When we took to a _basha_ we\r\ndiscovered that, owing to the roughness of the road, we had a driver\r\nfor each of our two horses. We had also an agile lad who hung on first\r\nto one part and then another of the vehicle and seemed to be essential\r\nin some way to its successful management. The head of the hatless\r\nchief driver was shaved absolutely smooth.\r\n\r\nIt was a rare thing for a foreigner to pass this way. My companion\r\nfrequently told me that he had difficulty in understanding what people\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWe saw an extinct volcano called \"Green Field Mountain.\" There was not\r\na tree on it and it was said never to have possessed any. The whole\r\nsurface was closely cut, the patches cut at different periods showing\r\nup in rectangular strips of varying shades. Wherever the hills were\r\ntreeless and too steep for cultivation they were carefully cut for\r\nfodder. In cultivable places houses were standing on the minimum of\r\nground. More than once we had a view of a characteristic piece of\r\nscenery, a dashing stream seen through a clump of bamboo.\r\n\r\nWhen our basha stopped for the feeding of the horses, they had a tub\r\nof mixture composed of boiled naked barley, rice chaff, chopped straw\r\nand chopped green stuff. I noticed near the inn a doll in a tree. It\r\nhad been put there by children who believe that they can secure by so\r\ndoing a fine day for an outing. When we started again we met with a\r\ncompany of strolling players: a man, his wife and two girls, all with\r\nclever faces. We also saw several peasant anglers fishing or going\r\nhome with their catch. A licence available from July to December cost\r\n50 sen.\r\n\r\nAt a shop I made a note of its signs, the usual strips of white wood\r\nabout 8 ins. by 3, nailed up perpendicularly, with the inscriptions\r\nwritten in black. One sign was the announcement of the name and\r\naddress of the householder, which must be shown on every Japanese\r\nhouse. A second stated that the place was licensed as a shop, a third\r\nthat the householder's wife was licensed to keep an inn, a fourth that\r\nthe householder was a cocoon merchant, a fifth that he was a member of\r\nthe co-operative credit society, a sixth that he belonged to the Red\r\nCross Society, a seventh that his wife was a member of the Patriotic\r\nWomen's Society,[188] the eighth, ninth and tenth that the shopkeeper\r\nwas an adherent of a certain Shinto shrine, a member of a Shinto\r\norganisation and had visited three shrines and made donations to them.\r\nAn eleventh board proclaimed that he was of the Zen sect of Buddhism.\r\nFinally, there was a box in which was stored the charms from various\r\nshrines.\r\n\r\nWe passed a company of villagers working on the road for the local\r\nauthority. The labourers were chiefly old people and they were taking\r\ntheir task very easily. Farther along the road men and women were\r\nworking singly. It seemed that the labourers belonged to families\r\nwhich, instead of paying rates, did a bit of roadmending. The work was\r\ndone when they had time to spare.\r\n\r\nFor some time we had been in a part of the country in which the ridges\r\nof the houses were of tiles. At an earlier stage of our journey they\r\nhad been either of straw or of earth with flowers or shrubs growing in\r\nit. The shiny, red-brown tiles give place elsewhere to a\r\nslate-coloured variety. The surface of all of these tiles is so\r\nsmooth that they are unlikely to change their hard tint for years.\r\nMeanwhile they give the villages a look of newness. Their use is\r\nspreading rapidly. Shiny though the tiles may be, one cannot but\r\nadmire the neat way in which they interlock. One day when I wondered\r\nabout the cost involved in recovering roofs with these tiles, a woman\r\nworker who overheard me promptly said that, reckoning tiles and\r\nlabour, the cost was 60 or 70 sen per 22 tiles. In the old days tiled\r\nporticoes were forbidden to the commonalty. They were allowed only to\r\ndaimyos who also used exclusively the arm rests which every visitor to\r\nan inn may now command. Besides arm rests I have frequently had\r\nkneeling cushions of the white brocade formerly used only for the\r\n_zabuton_ of Buddhist priests.\r\n\r\nIn the county through which we were passing the fine water grass,\r\ncalled _i_, used for mat making, is grown on an area of about 78\r\n_chō_. It is sown in seed beds like rice and is transplanted into\r\ninferior paddies in September. (The grass is better grown in Hiroshima\r\nand Okayama.)\r\n\r\nI saw a beautiful tree in red blossom. The name given to it is \"monkey\r\nslip,\" because of the smoothness of its skin, which recalled the name\r\nof that very different ornament of suburban gardens, \"monkey puzzle.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this journey we recovered something of the conditions of\r\nold-time travel. There were chats by the way and conferences at the\r\ninn in the evening and in the morning concerning distances, the kind\r\nof vehicles available, the character of their drivers, the charges,\r\nthe condition of the road, the probable weather and the places at\r\nwhich satisfactory accommodation might be had. What was different from\r\nthe old days was that at every stopping-place but one we had electric\r\nlight. Part of our journey was done in a small motor bus lighted by\r\nelectricity. Like the automobile we had hired a day or two before, it\r\nwas driven--by two young men in blue cotton tights--at too high a\r\nspeed considering the narrowness and curliness of the roads by which\r\nwe crossed the passes. The roads are kept in reasonably good\r\ncondition, but they were made for hand cart and _kuruma_ traffic.\r\n\r\nWe passed an island on which I was told there were a dozen houses.\r\nWhen a death occurs a beacon fire is made and a priest on the mainland\r\nconducts a funeral ceremony. By the custom of the island it is\r\nforbidden to increase the number of the houses, so presumably several\r\nfamilies live together. In the mountain communities of the mainland,\r\nwhere the number of houses is also restricted, it is usual for only\r\nthe eldest brother to be allowed to marry. The children of younger\r\nbrothers are brought up in the families of their mothers.\r\n\r\nWe passed at one of the fishing hamlets the wreck of a Russian cruiser\r\nwhich came ashore after the battle of Tsushima. Two boat derricks from\r\nthe cruiser served as gate posts at the entrance of the school\r\nplayground.\r\n\r\nA familiar sight on a country road is the itinerant medicine vendor.\r\nHe or his employer believes in pushing business by means of an\r\nimpressive outfit. One typical cure-all seller, who had his medicines\r\nin a shiny bag slung over his shoulders, wore yellow shoes, cotton\r\ndrawers, a frock coat, a peaked cap with three gold stripes, and a\r\nmysterious badge. On his hands he had white cotton gloves and as he\r\nwalked he played a concertina. A common practice is to leave with\r\nhousewives a bag of medicines without charge. Next year another call\r\nis made, when the pills and what not which have been used are paid for\r\nand a new bag is exchanged for the old one.\r\n\r\nThe use of dogs to help to draw _kuruma_ is forbidden in some\r\nprefectures, but in three stages of our journey in Shimane we had the\r\naid of robust dogs. During this period, however, I saw, attached to\r\n_kuruma_ we passed, three dogs which did not seem up to their work.\r\nDogs suffer when used for draught purposes because their chests are\r\nnot adapted for pulling and because the pads of their feet get tender.\r\nThe animals we had were treated well. Each _kuruma_ had a cord, with a\r\nhook at the end, attached to it; and this hook was slipped into a ring\r\non the dog's harness. The dogs were released when we went downhill and\r\nusually on the level. Several times during each run, when we came to a\r\nstream or a pond or even a ditch, the dogs were released for a bathe.\r\nThey invariably leapt into the water, drank moderately, and then, if\r\nthe water was too shallow for swimming, sat down in it and then lay\r\ndown. Sometimes a dog temporarily at liberty would find on his own\r\naccount a small water hole, and it was comical to see him taking a\r\nsitz bath in it. When the sun was hot a dog would sometimes be\r\nretained on his cord when not pulling in order that he might trot\r\nalong in the shade below the _kuruma_. The dog of the _kuruma_\r\nfollowing mine usually managed when pulling to take advantage of the\r\nshade thrown by my vehicle. A _kurumaya_ told me that he had given 8\r\nyen for his dog. Dogs were sometimes sold for from 10 to 15 yen. The\r\ndifficulty was to get a dog that had good feet and would pull. The\r\ndogs I saw were all mongrels with sometimes a retriever, bloodhound or\r\nGreat Dane strain.\r\n\r\nI made enquiries about another county town library. There were 18,000\r\nvolumes of which 300 consisted of European books and 600 of bound\r\nmagazines. The annual expenditure on books, and I presume magazines,\r\nwas 600 yen.\r\n\r\nWe passed a \"special tribe\" hamlet. Here the Eta were devoting\r\nthemselves to tanning and bamboo work. I was told of other \"peculiar\r\npeople\" called Hachia, also of a hawker-beggar class which sells small\r\nthings of brass or bamboo or travels with performing monkeys.\r\n\r\nWater from hot springs is piped long distances in water pipes made of\r\nbamboo trunks, the ends of which are pushed into one another. A turn\r\nis secured by running two pipes at the angle required into a block of\r\nwood which has been bored to fit.\r\n\r\nWhen we got down to the sand dunes there were windbreaks, 10 or 15 ft.\r\nhigh, made of closely planted pines cut flat at the top. Elsewhere I\r\nsaw such windbreaks 30 ft. high. On the telegraph wires there were big\r\nspiders' webs about 4 ft. in diameter.\r\n\r\nAs we sped through a village my attention was attracted by a funeral\r\nfeast. The pushed-back _shoji_ showed about a dozen men sitting in a\r\ncircle eating and drinking. Women were waiting on them. At the back of\r\nthe room, making part of the circle, was the square coffin covered by\r\na white canopy.\r\n\r\nWhile passing a Buddhist temple I heard the sound of preaching. It\r\nmight have been a voice from a church or chapel at home.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards I came on a memorial to the man who introduced the\r\nsweet potato into the locality 150 years before. This was the first of\r\nmany sweet-potato memorials which I encountered in the prefecture and\r\nelsewhere. Sometimes there were offerings before the monuments.\r\nOccasionally the memorial took the form of a stone cut in the shape of\r\na potato. There is a great exportation of sweet potatoes--sliced and\r\ndried until they are brittle--to the north of Japan where the tuber\r\ncannot be cultivated.[189]\r\n\r\nWhile we rested at the house of a friend of my companion we spoke of\r\nemigration. There are four or five emigration companies, and it is an\r\ninteresting question just how much emigration is due to the initiative\r\nof the emigrants themselves and how much to the activity of the\r\ncompanies. The chief reason which induces emigrants to go to South\r\nAmerica is that, under the contract system, they get twice as much\r\nmoney as they would obtain, say, in Formosa.[190]\r\n\r\nOur host did not remember any foreigner visiting his village since his\r\nboyhood, though it is on the main road. It took nearly four days for a\r\nTokyo newspaper to arrive. This region is so little known that when a\r\nresident mentioned it in Tokyo he was sometimes asked if it was in\r\nHokkaido.\r\n\r\nI was interested to see how many villages had erected monuments to\r\nyoung men who had won distinction away from home as wrestlers.\r\n\r\nI had often noticed bulls drawing carts and behaving as sedately as\r\ndonkeys, but it was new to see a bull tethered at the roadside with\r\nchildren playing round it. Why are the Japanese bulls so friendly?\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous regions we passed through I saw several paddies no\r\nbigger than a hearthrug. At one spot a land crab scurried across the\r\nroad. It was red in colour and about 2-1/2 ins. long.\r\n\r\nAt a village office the headman's gossip was that priests had been\r\nforbidden by the prefecture to interfere in elections. We looked\r\nthrough the expenses of the village agricultural association. For a\r\nlecture series 5 yen a month was being paid. Then there had been an\r\nexpenditure by way of subsidising a children's campaign against\r\ninsects preying on rice. For ten of the little clusters of eggs one\r\nmay see on the backs of leaves 4 rin was paid, while for 10 moths the\r\nreward was 2 rin. The association spent a further 10 yen on helping\r\nyoung people to attend lectures at a distance. The commune in which\r\nthose things had been done numbered 3,100 people. There had been two\r\npolice offences during the year, but both offenders were strangers to\r\nthe locality.\r\n\r\nIn a cutting which was being made for the new railway, girl labourers\r\nwere steering their trucks of soil down a half-mile descent and\r\nsinging as they made the exhilarating run. The building of a railway\r\nthrough a closely cultivated and closely populated country involves\r\nthe destruction of a large amount of fertile land and the rebuilding\r\nof many houses. The area of agricultural land taken during the\r\npreceding and present reigns, not only for railways and railway\r\nstations but for roads, barracks, schools and other public buildings,\r\nhas been enormous. \"The owner of land removed from cultivation may\r\nseem to do well by turning his property into cash,\" a man said to me.\r\n\"He may also profit to some extent while the railway is building by\r\nthe jobs he is able to do for the contractor, with the assistance of\r\nhis family and his horse or bull; but afterwards he has often to seek\r\nanother way of earning his living than farming.\"\r\n\r\nWe neared railhead on a market day and many folk in their best were\r\nwalking along the roads. Of fourteen umbrellas used as parasols to\r\nkeep off the sun that I counted one only was of the Japanese paper\r\nsort; all the others were black silk on steel ribs in \"foreign style\"\r\nexcept for a crude embroidery on the silk.\r\n\r\nWhen we got into the town it was as much as our _kurumaya_ could do to\r\nmove through the dense crowd of rustics in front of booths and shops.\r\nOnce more I was impressed by the imperturbability and natural\r\ncourtesy of the people. At the station quite a number of farmers and\r\ntheir families had assembled, not to travel by the train but to see it\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nDuring the short journey by train I noticed lagoons in which fish were\r\nartificially fed. At an agricultural experiment station in the place\r\nat which we alighted there were two specimen windmills set up to show\r\nfarmers who were fortunate enough to have ammonia water on their land\r\nthe cheapest means of raising it for their paddies. The tendency here\r\nas elsewhere was to apply too much of the ammonia water. All rubbish\r\non this extensive experiment station was carefully burnt under cover\r\nin order to demonstrate the importance not only of getting all the\r\npotash possible but of preserving it when obtained.\r\n\r\nFarmers who are without secondary industries are short of cash except\r\nat the times when barley, rice and cocoons are sold, and in certain\r\nplaces they seem to have taken to saving money on salt. An old man\r\ntold us with tears in his eyes how he had protested to his neighbours\r\nagainst the tendency to do without salt. An excuse for attempting to\r\nsave on salt, besides the economical one, was the size of the salt\r\ncubes. Neighbours clubbed together to buy a cube, and thus a family,\r\nwhen it had finished its share, had to wait until the neighbours had\r\ndisposed of theirs and market day came round.[191]\r\n\r\nI saw a monument erected to the memory of \"a good farmer\" who had\r\nplanted a wood and developed irrigation.\r\n\r\nWe made a stay at the spot where, on a forest-clad hill overlooking\r\nthe sea, there stands in utter simplicity the great shrine of Izumo.\r\nThe customary collection of shops and hotels clustering at the town\r\nend of the avenue of _torii_ cannot impair the impression which is\r\nmade on the alien beholder by this shrine in the purest style of\r\nShinto architecture. In the month in which we arrived at Izumo the\r\ndeities are believed to gather there. Before the shrine the Japanese\r\nvisitor makes his obeisance and his offering at the precise spot--four\r\nplaces are marked--to which his rank permits him to advance. (This\r\ninscription may be read: \"Common people at the doorway.\") The\r\nestimate which an official gave me of the number of visitors last\r\nyear, 40,000, bore no relation to the \"quarter of a million\" of the\r\nguide book. But it had been a bad year for farmers. Forty-seven\r\ngeisha, who had reported the previous year that they had received\r\n35,000 yen--there is no limit to what is tabulated in Japan--now\r\nreported that they had gained only half that sum in twelve months,\r\n\"the price of cocoons being so low that even well-to-do farmers could\r\nnot come.\" I noticed that there was a clock let into one of the\r\ngranite votive pillars of the avenue along which one walks from the\r\ntown to the shrine. As I glanced at the clock it happened that the\r\nsound of children's voices reached me from a primary school. I\r\nwondered what time and modern education, which have brought such\r\nchanges in Japan, might make of it all.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[186] The railway has now been extended in the direction of Yamaguchi.\r\n\r\n[187] See Appendix LI.\r\n\r\n[188] Protests have been made against the way in which the country\r\npeople are dunned for subscriptions to these semi-official\r\norganisations. A high agricultural authority has stated that in Nagano\r\nthe farmers' taxes and subscriptions to the Red Cross and Patriotic\r\nWomen Societies are from 65 to 70 per cent. of their expenditure as\r\nagainst 30 to 35 per cent. spent on outlay other than food and\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\n[189] _Satsuma-imo_ is sweet potato. Our potato is called _jaga-imo_\r\nor _bareisho_. _Imo_ is the general name.\r\n\r\n[190] See Appendix LII.\r\n\r\n[191] The Salt Monopoly profits are estimated at 314,204 yen for\r\n1920-21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF LAFCADIO HEARN\r\n\r\n(SHIMANE, TOTTORI AND HYOGO)\r\n\r\nThose who suffer learn, those who love know.--MRS. HAVELOCK ELLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Matsue, with which the name of Lafcadio Hearn will always be\r\nassociated, I chanced to arrive on the anniversary of his death. His\r\nlocal admirers were holding a memorial meeting. As a foreigner I was\r\nhonoured with a request to attend. First, however, I had the chance of\r\nvisiting Hearn's house. Matsue was the first place at which Hearn\r\nlived. He always remembered it and at last came back there to marry.\r\nExcept that a pond has been filled up--no doubt to reduce the number\r\nof mosquitoes--the garden of his house is little changed.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the meeting was old pupils' grateful\r\nrecollections of Hearn, the middle-school teacher. The gathering was\r\nheld in a room belonging to the town library in the prefectural\r\ngrounds, but neither the Governor nor the mayor was present. A\r\nsympathetic speech was made by a chance visitor to the town, the\r\nsecretary-general to the House of Peers. He recalled the antagonism\r\nwhich the young men at Tokyo University, himself among them, felt\r\ntowards the odd figure of Hearn--he had a terribly strained eye and\r\nwore a monocle--when he became a professor, and how very soon he\r\ngained the confidence and regard of the class.\r\n\r\nI had often wondered that there was no Japanese memorial to Hearn, and\r\nwhen I rose to speak I said so. I added that it was rare to meet a\r\nJapanese who had any understanding of how much Hearn had done in\r\nforming the conception of Japan possessed by thousands of Europeans\r\nand Americans. The fault in so many books about Japan, I went on, was\r\nnot that their \"facts\" were wrong. What was wrong was their authors'\r\nattitude of mind. I had heard Japanese say that Hearn was \"too\r\npoetical\" and that some of his inferences were \"inaccurate.\" That was\r\nas might be. What mattered was that the mental attitude of Hearn was\r\nso largely right. He did not approach Japan as a mere \"fact\" collector\r\nor as a superior person. What he brought to the country was the\r\nhumble, studious, imaginative, sympathetic attitude; and it was only\r\nby men and women of his rare type that peoples were interpreted one to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn that free-and-easy way in which meetings are conducted in Japan it\r\nwas permissible for us to leave after another speech had been made.\r\nThe proceedings were interrupted while the promoters of the gathering\r\nshowed us a collection of books and memorials of Hearn, arranged under\r\na large portrait, and accompanied us to the door of the hall. I do not\r\nrecall during the time I was in Japan any other public gathering in\r\nhonour of Hearn, and I met several prominent men who had either never\r\nheard his name or knew nothing of the far-reaching influence of his\r\nbooks. But some months after this Matsue meeting there was included\r\namong the Coronation honours a posthumous distinction for\r\nHearn--\"fourth rank of the junior grade.\"[192]\r\n\r\nDuring this journey I attended a dinner of officials and leading\r\nagriculturists and had the odd sensation of making a short\r\nafter-dinner speech on my knees. At such a dinner the guests kneel on\r\ncushions ranged round the four walls of the room, and each man has a\r\nlow lacquer table to himself, and a geisha to wait on him. When the\r\ngeisha is not bringing in new dishes or replenishing the _saké_\r\nbottle, she kneels before the table and chatters entertainingly. The\r\ngovernors of the feast visit the guests of honour and drink with them.\r\nIn the same way a guest drinks with his neighbour and with his\r\nattendant geisha. I have a vivid memory of a grave and elderly\r\ndignitary who at the merry stage of such a function capered the whole\r\nlength of the room with his kneeling-cushion balanced on the top of\r\nhis head. There is a growing temperance movement in Japan but a\r\nteetotaller is still something of an oddity. My abstinence from _saké_\r\nwas frequently supposed to be the result of a vow.\r\n\r\nAlthough the average geisha may be inane in her patter and have little\r\nmore than conventional grace and charm, I have been waited on by girls\r\nwho added real mental celerity, wit and a power of skilful mimicry to\r\nthat elusive and seductive quality that accounts for the impregnable\r\nposition of their class. At one dinner impersonations in both the\r\ncomic and the tragic vein were given by a girl of unmistakable genius.\r\nFrequently a plain, elderly geisha will display unsuspected mimetic\r\nability. Alas, behind the merry laugh and sprightliness of the girls\r\nwho adorn a feast lurks a skeleton. One is haunted by thoughts of the\r\nfuture of a large proportion of these butterflies. No doubt most\r\nforeigners generalise too freely in identifying the professions of\r\ngeisha and _joro_. In the present organisation of society some geisha\r\nplay a legitimate rôle. They gain in the career for which they have\r\nlaboriously trained an outlet for the expression of artistic and\r\nsocial gifts which would have been denied them in domestic life. At\r\nthe same time the degrading character of the life led by many geisha\r\ncannot be doubted. Apart from every other consideration the temptation\r\nto drink is great. The opening of new avenues to feminine ability, the\r\nenlarged opportunities of education and self-respect and the\r\nincreasing opening for women on the stage--from which women have been\r\nexcluded hitherto--must have their effect in turning the minds of\r\ngirls of wit and originality to other means of earning a living than\r\nthe morally and physically hazardous profession of the geisha.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Matsue by steamer on our way to Tottori prefecture I saw\r\nmiddle-school eights at practice. An agriculturist told me of the\r\ncustom of giving holidays to oxen and horses. The villagers carefully\r\nbrush their animals, decorate them and lead them to pastures where,\r\ntethered to rings attached to a long rope, \"they may graze together\r\npleasantly.\" One of the islands we visited bore the name of the giant\r\nradish, Daikon, which is itself a corruption of the word for octopus.\r\nThe island devoted itself mainly to the growing of peonies and\r\nginseng. The ginseng is largely exported to China and Korea, but there\r\nis a certain consumption in Japan. Ginseng is sometimes chewed, but is\r\ngenerally soaked, the liquid being drunk. Ginseng is popularly\r\nsupposed to be an invigorant, and Japanese doctors in Korea have\r\nlately declared that it has some value. The root is costly, hence the\r\nproverb about eating ginseng and hanging oneself, i.e. getting into\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nIn walking across the island I passed a forlorn little shrine. It was\r\nmerely a rough shed with a wide shelf at the back, on which stood a\r\nrow of worn and dusty figures, decked with the clothes of children\r\nwhose recovery was supposed to have been due to their influence. It\r\nwas raining and the shelter was full of children playing in the\r\ncompany of an old crone with a baby on her back. Further on in the\r\nvillage I came across a new public bath. The price of admission was\r\none sen, children half price.\r\n\r\nA small port was pointed out to me as being open to foreign trade.\r\nEverybody is not aware that in Japan there is a restriction upon\r\nforeign shipping except at sixty specified places.[193] The reason\r\ngiven for the restriction is the unprofitableness of custom houses at\r\nsmall places. One day, perhaps, the world will wake up to the\r\ninconvenience and financial burden imposed by the custom-house system\r\nof raising revenue.\r\n\r\nWe stayed the night at a little place at the eastern extremity of the\r\nShimane promontory where there is a shrine and no cultivation of any\r\nsort is allowed \"for fear of defilement.\" Waste products are taken\r\naway by boat. I marked a contrast between theoretical and practical\r\nholiness. Our inn overlooked a special landing-place where, because a\r\n\"sacred boat\" from the shrine is launched there, a notice had been put\r\nup forbidding the throwing of rubbish into the sea. A few minutes\r\nafter the board had been pointed out to me I saw an old man cast a\r\nconsiderable mass of rubbish into the water not six feet away from it.\r\nWhen we visited the shrine three pilgrims were at their devotions. The\r\nnext morning when our steamer left and the chief priest of the shrine\r\nwas bidding us adieu my attention was attracted by loud conversation\r\nin the second storey of an inn, the _shoji_ of which were open. Our\r\npilgrims, two of whom were bald, had spent the night at an inn of bad\r\ncharacter and were now in the company of prostitutes in the sight of\r\nall men. One pilgrim had a girl on his knee, another was himself on a\r\ngirl's knee and a third had his arm round a girl's neck. In this\r\n\"sacred\" place of 2,000 inhabitants there were forty \"double license\"\r\ngirls, five being natives. A few years ago all the girls were natives.\r\nA \"double license\" girl means one who is licensed both as a geisha and\r\na prostitute. The plan of issuing \"double licenses\" is adopted at\r\nKyoto and elsewhere. As to the pilgrims to whom I have referred,\r\nsomeone quoted to me the saying, \"It is only half a pilgrimage going\r\nto the shrine without seeing the girls.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the custom of launching a sacred boat it is not without\r\nsignificance that many Japanese deities have some connection with the\r\nsea. Even in the case of the deities of shrines a long way from the\r\nsea the ceremony of \"going down to the sea\" is sometimes observed.\r\nSand and sea water are sent for in order to be mixed with the water\r\nused to cleanse the car in which the figure of the deity is drawn\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\nThe social and financial position of tenants was illustrated by an\r\nincident at an inn. As the maid came from the country I asked her if\r\nher father were a tenant or an owner. My companion interrupted to tell\r\nme that the question was not judiciously framed because the girl would\r\n\"think it a disgrace to own that her father was a tenant.\" The name of\r\na tenant used long ago to be \"water drinker.\" This waiting-maid was a\r\ngood-looking and rather clever girl. I was dismayed when my friend\r\ntold me that she had said to him quite simply that she had thoughts\r\nof becoming a _joro_. She thought it would be a \"more interesting\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Tottori prefecture we found ourselves in a country\r\nwhich grows more cotton than any other. Japanese cotton (grown on\r\nabout 400 _chō_) is unsuitable for manufacture into thread, but\r\nbecause of its elasticity is considered to be valuable for the padding\r\nof winter clothing and for _futon_ and _zabuton_. Their softness is\r\nmaintained by daily sunning.\r\n\r\nAt a county office I noted that the persons who were receiving relief\r\nwere classified as follows: Illness, 26; cripples, 17; old age, 16;\r\nschoolboys, 12; infancy, 1.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our journey a Shinto priest was pointed out to me as\r\nobserving the priestly taboo by refusing tea and cake. I noticed,\r\nhowever, that he smoked. I was told that when he was in Tokyo he\r\npurified himself in the sea even in midwinter. I did not like his\r\nappearance. Nor for the matter of that was I impressed by the\r\ncountenances of some Buddhist priests I encountered in the train from\r\ntime to time. \"Thinking always of money,\" someone said. But every now\r\nand again I saw fine priestly faces.\r\n\r\nI have noted down very little in regard to the crops and the\r\ncountryside in Tottori. Things seemed very much the same as I had seen\r\nin Shimane. At an agricultural show in the city of Tottori the\r\nvarieties of yam and taro were so numerous as to deceive the average\r\nWesterner into believing that he was seeing the roots of different\r\nkinds of plants. A feature of the show was a large realistic model of\r\na rice field with two life-size figures.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I talked with two distinguished men until a late hour.\r\n\"We are not a metaphysical people,\" one of them said. \"Nor were our\r\nforefathers as religious as some students may suppose. Those who went\r\nbefore us gave to the Buddhist shrine and even worshipped there, but\r\ntheir daily life and their religion had no close connection. We did\r\nnot define religion closely. Religion has phases according to the\r\ndegree of public instruction. Our religion has had more to do with\r\npropitiation and good fortune than with morality. If you had come here\r\na century ago you would have been unable to find even then religion\r\nafter another pattern. If it be said that a man must be religious in\r\norder to be good the person who says so does not look about him. I am\r\nnot afraid to say that our people are good as a result of long\r\ntraining in good behaviour. Their good character is due to the same\r\ncauses as the freedom from rowdiness which may be marked in our\r\ncrowds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is wanted in the villages,\" said the other personage, \"is one\r\ngood personality in each.\" I said that the young men's association\r\nseemed to me to be often a dull thing, chiefly indeed a mechanism by\r\nmeans of which serious persons in a village got the young men to work\r\novertime. \"Yes,\" was the response, \"the old men make the young fellows\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nThe first speaker said that there had been three watchwords for the\r\nrural districts. \"There was Industrialisation and Increase of\r\nProduction. There was Public Spirit and Public Welfare. There was The\r\nShinto Shrine the Centre of the Village. We have a certain conception\r\nof a model village, but perhaps some hypocrisy may mingle with it.\r\nThey say that the village with well-kept Buddhist and Shinto shrines\r\nis generally a good village.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" I ventured, \"the village where there is some\r\nnon-material feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThe rejoinder was: \"Western religion is too high, and, I fear,\r\ninapplicable to our life. It may be that we are too easily contented.\r\nBut there are nearly 60 millions of us. I do not know that we feel a\r\nneed or have a vacant place for religion. There is certainly not much\r\nhope for an increase of the influence of Buddhism.\"\r\n\r\nAs we went along in the train I was told that on a sixth of the rice\r\narea in Tottori there had been a loss of 70 per cent. by wind. When a\r\nman's harvest loss exceeds this percentage he is not liable for rates\r\nand taxes. A passenger told me about \"nursery pasture.\" This is a\r\npatch of grass in the hills to which a farmer sends his ox to be\r\npastured in common with the oxen of other farmers under the care of a\r\nsingle herdsman. It is from cattle keeping on this modest scale that\r\nthe present beef requirements of the country are largely met.[194]\r\n\r\nAlthough the opinions expressed to me by Governors of prefectures\r\nhave been frequently recorded in these pages, I have not felt at\r\nliberty to identify more than one of the Excellencies who were good\r\nenough to express their views to me. A friend who knew many Governors\r\noffered me the following criticism, which I thought just: \"They are\r\ntoo practical and too much absorbed in administration to be able to\r\nthink. Often they read very little after leaving the university. They\r\nhave seldom anything to tell you about other than ordinary things, and\r\nthey seldom show their hearts. You cannot learn much from Governors\r\nwho have nothing original to say or are fearful or live in their frock\r\ncoats or do not mean to show half their minds or are practising the\r\nold official trick of talking round and round and always evading the\r\npoint. One fault of Governors is that they are being continually\r\ntransferred from prefecture to prefecture. You have no doubt yourself\r\nnoticed how often Governors were new to their prefectures. But with\r\nall the faults that our Governors have, there are not a few able, good\r\nand kind men among them and they are not recruited from Parliament but\r\nmust be members of the Civil Service. One of the most common words in\r\nour political life is _genshitsu_, 'responsibility for one's own\r\nwords.' If Governors fear to assume the responsibility of their own\r\nviews they are only of a part with a great deal of the official\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nWe turned away from the northern sea coast and struck south in order\r\nto cross Japan to the Inland Sea en route for Kobe and Tokyo.\r\n\r\nAs we came through Hyogo prefecture my companion pointed to hill after\r\nhill which had been afforested since his youth. One of the things\r\nwhich interested me was the number and the tameness of the kites which\r\nwere catching frogs in the paddies.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Hyogo I had the advantage of a chat with one who for\r\nmany years past had thought about the rural situation in Japan\r\ngenerally. He spoke of \"the late Professor King's idealising of the\r\nJapanese farmer's condition.\" He went on: \"While King laid stress on\r\nthe ability to be self-supporting on a small area he ignored the\r\nextent to which many rural people are underfed. The change in the\r\nMeiji era has been a gradual transference from ownership to tenancy.\r\nMany so-called representative farmers have been able to add field to\r\nfield until they have secured a substantial property and have ceased\r\nto be farmers. An extension of tenancy is to be deplored, not only\r\nbecause it takes away from the farmer a feeling of independence and of\r\nincentive, but because it creates a parasitic class which in Japan is\r\nperhaps even more parasitic than in the West. A landowner in the West\r\nalmost invariably realises that he has certain duties. In Japan a\r\nlandowner's duties to his neighbourhood and to the State are often\r\nimperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand the position of the farmer has been very much\r\nimproved socially. A great deal of pity bestowed by the casual foreign\r\nvisitor is wasted. The farmer is accustomed to extremes of heat and\r\ncold and to a bare living and poor shelter. And after all there is a\r\ngreat deal of happiness in the villages. It is hardly possible to take\r\na day's _kuruma_ ride without coming on a festival somewhere, and\r\ndrunkenness has undoubtedly diminished.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke with an old resident about the agricultural advance in the\r\nprefecture. \"In fifteen years,\" he said, \"our agricultural production\r\nhas doubled. As to the non-material condition of the people, generally\r\nspeaking the villagers are very shallow in their religion. Not so long\r\nago officials used to laugh at religion, but I don't know that some of\r\nthem are not now changing their point of view. Some of us have thought\r\nthat, just as we made a Japanese Buddhism, we might make a Japanese\r\nChristianity which would not conflict with our ideas.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[192] This is, I am officially informed, the highest rank ever\r\nbestowed on a foreigner; but then Hearn was naturalised. In 1921 an\r\nappreciation of \"Koizumi Yakumo\" was included by the Department of\r\nEducation in a middle-school textbook. Curiously enough, the fact that\r\nHearn married a Japanese is overlooked. Owing to the fact that Hearn\r\nbought land in Tokyo which has appreciated in value his family is in\r\ncomfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\n[193] Coastwise traffic is also forbidden to foreign vessels, as is\r\ntraffic between France and Algeria to other than French vessels.\r\n\r\n[194] See Appendix LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO MONTHS IN TEMPLE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE PEASANTS AND THEIR PRIESTS\r\n\r\n(NAGANO)\r\n\r\nThe condition of the lower orders is the true mark.--JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist temple in which I lived for about two months stands on\r\nhigh ground in a village lying about 2,500 ft. above sea-level in the\r\nprefecture of Nagano and does not seem to have been visited by\r\nforeigners. It is reached by a road which is little better than a\r\ntrack. No _kuruma_ are to be found in the district, but there are a\r\nfew light two-wheeled lorries. Practically all the traffic is on\r\nhorseback or on foot. There is a view of the Japanese Alps and of\r\nFuji.\r\n\r\nRunning through the village[195] is a river. Most of the summer it may\r\nbe crossed by stepping stones, but the width of the rocky bed gives\r\nsome notion of the volume of water which pours down after rains and on\r\nthe melting of the snow. Two or three miles up from the village a\r\nconsiderable amount of water is drawn off into two channels which have\r\nbeen dug, one on either side of the river, at a gentler slope than\r\nthat at which the stream flows. The rapid fall of the river is\r\nindicated by the fact that these channels reach the village more than\r\n100 ft. above the level at which the river itself enters it. The\r\nchannels, cut as they have been through sharply sloping banks packed\r\nwith boulders and big stones, and strengthened throughout by banking,\r\nin order to cope as far as possible with the torrents which rage down\r\nthe hillside in winter, represent a vast amount of communal labour. By\r\nthe side of each channel the excavated earth and stones have been used\r\nto make a path for pack horses. The water which comes down these\r\nchannels serves not only for the ordinary uses of the village but for\r\nirrigating the rice fields and for driving the many water wheels, the\r\nplashing and groaning of which are heard night and day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE (WITH SHINTO SHRINE ON THE LEFT)\r\nIN WHICH THIS CHAPTER WAS WRITTEN]\r\n\r\nThe whole area of the _oaza_ is officially recorded as 800 _chō_, but\r\nthe real area may be double, or even more than that. About 40 per\r\ncent. is cultivated either as paddy or as dry land. The remaining 60\r\nper cent., from which 18 _chō_ may be deducted for house land, is\r\nunder grass and wood. Half of this grass and woodland belongs to the\r\n_oaza_ and half to private persons. The grass is mostly couch grass\r\nand weeds. In places there is a certain amount of clover and vetch. Of\r\nthe 200 families, numbering about 1,700 people, less than a dozen are\r\ntenants. Of the others, a third cultivate their own land and hire\r\nsome more. The remaining two-thirds cultivate their own land and hire\r\nnone. The outstanding crop beyond rice is mulberry. A considerable\r\namount of millet and buckwheat is also grown.\r\n\r\nThe village is obviously well off. The signs are: successful\r\nsericulture, the large quantity of rice eaten, the number of\r\nwell-looking horses (the millet seems to be grown largely for them,\r\nbut they also receive beans and wheat boiled), the fact that no\r\nattempt is made to collect the considerable amount of horse manure on\r\nthe roads, the cared-for appearance of the temple and shrines, the\r\nalmost complete absence of tea-houses, the ease with which new land\r\nmay be obtained and the contented look of the people.\r\n\r\nOne does not expect to find in a remote and wholly Buddhist village\r\nmany other animals than horses, and in this community the additional\r\nlive stock consists of ten goats (kept for giving milk for invalids),\r\ntwo pigs and a number of poultry. A working horse over four years was\r\nworth 150 yen. The value of land[196] is to be considered in relation\r\nto local standards of value. It is doubtful if the priest, who seemed\r\nto be comfortably off, is in receipt of more than 250 yen a year. The\r\nmidwife, who belongs to the oldest family and has been trained in\r\nTokyo, gets from 2 to 2-1/2 yen per case. As new land is always\r\navailable on the hillsides there is very little emigration to the\r\ntowns, but twenty girls are working in the factories in the big\r\nsilk-reeling centre twelve miles off. The hillside land which is owned\r\nby the village is not sold but rented to those who want it. To make\r\nnew paddies is primarily a question of having enough capital with\r\nwhich to buy the artificial manure required for the crops.\r\n\r\nI was given to understand that no one in the village was poor enough\r\nto need public help, but that the school fees of twelve children were\r\npaid by the community. This is a system peculiar to Nagano, which is a\r\nprogressive prefecture vying with other prefectures to increase the\r\npercentage of school attendance. One of the signs of the well-off\r\ncharacter of the village which appears when one is able to investigate\r\na little is that the place is a favourite haunt of beggars, who, I am\r\ntold--every calling is organised--have made it over to the less\r\nfortunate members of their fraternity. The village has enough money to\r\nspend to make it worth while for tradesmen from a distance to open\r\ntemporary shops every _Bon_ season and at the New Year festival. A man\r\nin an average position may lay out 200 yen on his daughter's wedding.\r\nA farmer who knew his fellow-villagers' position pretty closely said\r\nhe thought that the position of tenant farmers was \"rather well.\" In\r\nthe whole village there might be seventy or eighty householders who\r\nhad some debt, but it was justifiable. In an ordinary year about 150\r\nfarmers would have something to lay by after their twelve months'\r\nwork. Perhaps fifty farmers, if the price of rice or of cocoons were\r\nlow, might be unable to save; but ordinarily they would have something\r\nin their pockets. About half the farmers are engaged in sericulture--I\r\nnoticed cocoons offered at the shrine. The other half sell their\r\nmulberry leaf crop to their neighbours. The village, which is perhaps\r\n400 years old, is increasing in population by about forty every year.\r\nThe family which is said to have founded the village is still largely\r\nrepresented in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRE ENGINE AND PRIMITIVE FIGURES]\r\n\r\nThe village has as many as six fire engines, which can be moved about\r\neither on wheels or on runners according to the weather, and as many\r\nlook-out ladders and fire-alarm bells. The young men's association has\r\nno fewer than half a dozen buildings, the property of the village.\r\nFive of them are little more than sheds and seem to be used on wet\r\ndays as nurseries and playrooms for children. The sixth is the\r\nvillage theatre, playing at which appears to have been abandoned for\r\nsome years. Travelling players give their shows where they will. The\r\ntheatre stands in a space encircled by large trees opposite the chief\r\nshrine of the village. There is also here a smaller shrine (fox god)\r\nand some tombstones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG MEN'S CLUB ROOM]\r\n\r\nBefore the chief shrine are two large leaden lanterns. At the base of\r\nthese a considerable strip of metal has been torn away. This unusual\r\ndestruction by village lads caused me to make enquiry. I found that\r\nthe boys had merely enlarged a hole made by adults. The destruction\r\nhad been wrought in order to remove the inscription on the lanterns.\r\nIt was said that the local donor had meanly omitted to make the\r\ncustomary gift to the shrine to cover the small expense of lighting\r\nthe lanterns on the occasion of festivals. It was the feeling of the\r\nvillagers, therefore, that he should not be allowed to blazon his name\r\nin connection with a shabby gift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEMORIAL STONES]\r\n\r\nThere is a ceremony about half a dozen times a year at the chief\r\nshrine, which is about a century old. The Shinto priest, who seemed to\r\nbe a genuine antiquary, was of opinion that the structure inside the\r\nshrine might have been built two hundred years ago. In addition to\r\nthis chief shrine and the small shrine near it, there are two other\r\nshrines in the village, one in the temple yard (god of happiness) and\r\nthe other (horse god) in an open space of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROOF PROTECTED AGAINST STORMS BY STONES]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable thing about the non-material life of\r\nthis village is the fact that it contains no fewer than 400 carved\r\nstones of a more or less religious character. A few are Buddhist; some\r\nare memorials to priests or teachers; several bear that representation\r\nof a man and a woman facing one another (p. 265) which is one of the\r\noldest mystic emblems; the majority are devoted apparently to the\r\nhorse god. Every man who loses a horse erects a stone. There are two\r\npersons in the village who can carve these stones at a cost of about 2\r\nyen. Some stones which are painted red are dedicated to the fire god.\r\nThe 400 stones of which I am speaking do not include grave stones.\r\nThese are seen everywhere, many of them just by the wayside. Nearly\r\nevery family buries in its own ground. Some burial places with stones\r\nof many forms dating back for a long period of years are extremely\r\nimpressive. At the _Bon_ season the grass on every burying ground is\r\ncarefully cut.\r\n\r\nAll the shop-keepers seem to own their own houses and all but three\r\nhave some land. There are three _saké_ shops, two of which sell other\r\nthings than _saké_, two general shops, two cake and sweet shops, two\r\ntobacco shops, a lantern shop and a barber. There are eight\r\ncarpenters, four stonecutters, five plasterers and wall builders, five\r\nwoodcutters, two roof makers, two horse shoers, and in the winter a\r\nblacksmith. (The cost of putting on four shoes is 60 sen.) All these\r\nartisans own their own houses and all have land.\r\n\r\nAs to the health of the village there are two doctors who come every\r\nother day. One was qualified at Chiba and the other at Sendai. They\r\nmake no charge for advice and the price of medicine is only 10 sen\r\nunless the materials are expensive. I suppose they may receive\r\npresents. They also probably have a piece of land. There is no\r\nveterinary surgeon, but one is to be found in the village which\r\ncomposes the other half of the commune.\r\n\r\nA physician who had been born in the village and was staying for a few\r\ndays with the Buddhist priest who was my host, thought that 90 per\r\ncent. of the villagers ate no meat whatever and that only 50 or 60 per\r\ncent. ate fish, and then only ceremonially, that is at particular\r\ntimes in the year when it is the custom in Japan to eat fish. The\r\nvillagers who did eat meat or fish did not take it oftener than twice\r\nor thrice a month. The canned meat and canned fish in the\r\nshops--Japanese brands--were used almost entirely for guests. The\r\ndoctor expressed the opinion of most Japanese that \"people who do not\r\neat meat are better tempered and can endure more.\" I have heard\r\nJapanese say that \"foreigners are short-tempered because they eat so\r\nmuch meat.\"\r\n\r\nWe spoke of the considerable consumption of pickles, highly salted or\r\nfermented. For example, in the ordinary 25-sen _bento_ (lunch) box\r\nthere are three or four different kinds of pickles. The doctor said\r\nthat pickles were not only a means of taking salt and so appetisers to\r\nhelp the rice down, but digestives; fermented pickles supplied\r\ndiastase which enabled the stomach to deal promptly with the large\r\nquantities of rice swallowed.\r\n\r\nI asked for the doctor's opinion as to the prevalence of tumours,\r\ndisplacements and cancer among women who labour in the fields and have\r\nto bring up children and do all the housework of a peasant's dwelling.\r\nThe doctor replied that he was disposed to think that cases of the\r\nailments I spoke of were not numerous. Cancer was certainly rare. He\r\nknew that in Japan rickets, goitre and gout were all less common than\r\nin the West. He expressed the opinion that childbirth was easier than\r\nin the West. It was a delight to see the fine carriage of the women\r\nand girls astride on the high saddles of the horses.[197] Both sexes\r\nin the district wear over their kimonos blue cotton trousers,\r\nsomething like a plumber's overall only tighter in the legs. The women\r\nare certainly strong. One day I saw a woman carrying uphill on her\r\nback two wooden doors about 6 ft. by 5 ft. 6 ins. An old woman I met\r\non the road volunteered her view that women were \"stronger\" than men.\r\nShe was very much concerned to know how foreigners could live without\r\neating rice. She said--and this is characteristically Japanese--that\r\nshe envied me being able to travel all over the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFF TO THE UPLAND FIELDS]\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist temple is built wholly of wood and the roof is thatched.\r\nWhenever there was an earthquake the timbers seemed to crackle rather\r\nthan creak. The temple is relatively new and seems to have been built\r\nwith materials given by the villagers and by means of a gift of 1,000\r\nyen. The workmanship was local and a good deal of it was faulty. This\r\nmay have been due to lack of experience, but it is more likely that\r\nthe cause was limited funds. The plan and proportions of the building\r\nare excellent and the carving is first-rate. The right of\r\n\"presentation to the living\" is in the hands of the village. The\r\npriest and his family live in a large house on one side of the temple.\r\nOn the other side is a small Shinto shrine to which the priest seems\r\nto give such attention as is necessary. The temple is Shingon. There\r\nis a sermon once a year only, or \"when some famous man comes.\" The\r\nactual temple in which the priest, who showed me a fine collection of\r\nrobes, conducts his services is between forty and fifty mats in area.\r\nBehind it is the room in which the _ihai_ or tablets of the dead are\r\narranged. This part of the building is covered on the outside with\r\nplaster in the manner of a _kura_ (godown) so as to be fire-proof. On\r\neither side of the actual temple are rooms very much as in a spacious\r\nprivate house. There are two of eighteen and fifteen mats, two of\r\ntwelve and ten mats and two small ones. There is also a wide covered\r\n_engawa_ (verandah) in front and at the sides. A small kitchen and\r\nwhat the auctioneers call the usual offices complete the building.\r\n\r\nRight round the temple there is a nice garden which keeps the priest's\r\nman, a picturesque, sweet-tempered, guileless old fellow, occupied\r\nmuch of his time. The priest conducted a service twice a day, at 5:30\r\nin the morning and at 7:30 in the evening. When he fell ill and had to\r\nbe carried in a litter to the nearest town for an operation, we missed\r\nhis beautiful chanting and expert sounding of the deep-toned gong of\r\nthe sanctuary. The great bell in the court-yard was struck by the\r\npriest's boy at sundown. The priest kept the old rule against meat. He\r\nand his wife would not eat even cake or biscuits because they feared\r\nthat there might be milk and butter in them. The couple were very kind\r\nto us and we enjoyed a delightfully quiet life in the lofty sunny\r\ntemple rooms. I should judge that _Otera San_ (Mr. Temple) was\r\nrespected in the village. His wife was a bustling woman of such\r\nsweetness and simplicity of nature as can only be found in a far\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that the total incomings of the priest are probably\r\nabout 250 yen. He receives no salary but has his house free. He must\r\n\"discuss about anything wanted in the temple.\" I do not suppose he had\r\nto ask anybody whether he might lodge us or not. He receives\r\nconsiderable gifts of rice, perhaps to the value of 120 yen, at any\r\nrate enough for the whole year. He has also the rent of the \"glebe,\"\r\nwhich consists of 12 _tan_ of paddy, 2 _tan_ of dry field and 10 _tan_\r\nof woodland. Then there are the gifts which are made to him at\r\nfunerals and for the services he conducts at the villagers' houses on\r\nthe days of the dead. One day during the _Bon_ season every household\r\nsent a little girl or boy with a present to the priest. In return\r\nthese small visitors were given sweets. During the _Bon_ season some\r\nvery old men of the village came and worshipped at the Shinto shrine\r\nand were entertained with _saké_ by the priest on the _engawa_ of his\r\ntemple. The amount in the collecting box in front of the little Shinto\r\nshrine in the temple yard, largely in _rin_, would not be more than 10\r\nor 15 sen in the year. Most of the contributions are in the form of\r\npinches of rice. The priest may give 10 yen a year to his man who\r\nworks about the temple and his house and accompanies him to funerals\r\nand to the memorial services at the villagers' dwellings; but this\r\nservitor, like his master, no doubt receives presents.\r\n\r\nThe Shinto priest is probably not so well off as the Buddhist priest.\r\nThe village makes a small payment to him twice a year. At New Year 3\r\nyen in all may be flung in the collecting box at the shrine, but the\r\npriest has presents made to him when he goes to see ailing folk and\r\nwhen he officiates at the building of a new house. Most people when\r\nthey are ill seem to send for the Shinto priest. But he explained to\r\nme that he does not expect a sick man to \"worship only.\" He is\r\naccustomed to say to the people, \"Doctor first, god second,\" from\r\nwhich I was to conclude, one who heard told me, that the priest was\r\n\"rather a civilised man.\" The Shinto priest had succeeded a relative\r\nin his position. The village had found its Buddhist priest in a\r\nneighbouring district.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist priest told me that every year 150 or 160 men and women\r\nmade a pilgrimage to a famous shrine some few miles off. The custom\r\nwas for every house to be represented in the pilgrimage. Half a dozen\r\npeople in the year might go on personal pilgrimages and fifty or so\r\nmight visit a little shrine on a neighbouring mountain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195] The village consists of about 270 houses. It is joined\r\nadministratively to another village, about two miles off, in order to\r\nform a _mura_ (commune). The village I am about to describe is an\r\n_oaza_ (large hamlet), which is made up in its turn of two _aza_\r\n(small hamlets). These aza are themselves divided into six _kumi_\r\n(companies), which are again sub-divided, in the case of the largest,\r\ninto four.\r\n\r\n[196] See Appendix LIV.\r\n\r\n[197] The horses wear basket-work muzzles to prevent them nibbling the\r\ncrops. By way of compensation for these encumbrances they have head\r\ntassels and belly cloths to keep off the flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\"BON\" SEASON SCENES\r\n\r\n(NAGANO)\r\n\r\nAs moderns we have no direct affinity; as individuals we have a capacity\r\nfor personal sympathy.--MATTHEW ARNOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to be in the village during the _Bon_ season.\r\nThe idea is that the spirits which are visiting their old homes remain\r\nbetween the 11th and 14th of August. The 11th is called _mukae bon_\r\nand the 14th _okuri bon_. (_Mukae_ means going to meet; _okuri_ to see\r\noff.) On the 11th the villagers burned a piece of flax plant in front\r\nof their houses. That night the priest said a special prayer in the\r\ntemple and used the cymbals in addition to the ordinary gong and drum.\r\nThe prayer seemed peculiarly sad. Before the shrines in their houses\r\nthe villagers placed offerings. One was a horse made out of a\r\ncucumber, the legs being bits of flax twig and the tail and mane the\r\nhair-like substance from maize cobs. There were also offerings of real\r\nand artificial flowers and of grapes. In one house I visited I saw\r\n_geta_, _waraji_, kimonos, pumpkins, caramels and pencils. Strings of\r\nbuck-wheat macaroni were laid over twigs of flax set in a vase. The\r\n_ihai_ (name-plates of the dead) seemed to be displayed more\r\nprominently than usual. (They are kept in a kind of small oratory\r\ncalled _ihaido_, and after a time several names are collected on a\r\nsingle plate.) _Mochi_ (rice-flour dumpling) is eaten at this time. On\r\nthe 12th and 14th the priest called at each house for two or three\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nI asked if the villagers really believed that their dead returned at\r\nthe _Bon_ season. The answer was, \"Only the old men and young children\r\nbelieve that the dead actually come, but the young men and young\r\nwomen, when they see the burning of the flax-plant and the other\r\nthings that are done, think of the dead; they remember them solemnly\r\nat this time.\" And I think it was so. The stranger to a Japanese\r\nhouse, in which there is not only a Shinto shelf but a Buddhist\r\nshrine--where the name plates of the dead for several generations are\r\ntreasured--cannot but feel that, when all allowances are made for the\r\ndulling influences of use and wont, the plan is a means of taking the\r\nminds of the household beyond the daily round. The fact that there is\r\na certain familiarity with the things of the shrine and of the Shinto\r\nshelf, just as there is a certain freedom at the public shrines and in\r\nthe temple, does not destroy the impression. When a man has taken me\r\nto his little graveyard I have been struck by the lack of that\r\nlugubriousness which Western people commonly associate with what is\r\nsacred. The Japanese conception of reverence is somewhat different\r\nfrom our own. As to sorrow, the idea is, as is well known, that it is\r\nthe height of bad manners to trouble strangers with a display of what\r\nin many cases is largely a selfish grief. A manservant smiled when he\r\ntold me of his only son's death. On my offering sympathy the tears ran\r\ndown his face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMER'S WIFE]\r\n\r\nWhen the _Bon_ season ended on the fourteenth all the flowers and\r\ndecorations of the domestic shrines were taken early in the morning to\r\nthe bridge over the diminished river and flung down. The idea is\r\nperhaps that they are carried away to the sea. (As a matter of fact\r\nthere was so little water that almost everything flung in from the\r\nbridge remained in sight for weeks until there was a storm.) When the\r\nflowers and decorations had been cast from the bridge the people went\r\noff to worship at the graves. Many coloured streamers of paper,\r\nwritten on by the priest, were flying there.\r\n\r\nThe _Bon_ dances took place five nights running in the open space\r\nbetween the Shinto shrine and the old barn theatre. Nothing could have\r\nbeen duller. The line from _Ruddigore_ came to mind, \"This is one of\r\nour blameless dances.\" The first night the performers were evidently\r\nshy and the girls would hardly come forward. Things warmed up a little\r\nmore each night and on the last night of all there was a certain\r\nanimation; but even then the movement, the song and the whole scheme\r\nof the dance seemed to be lacking in vigour. What happened was that a\r\nnumber of lads gradually formed themselves into a ring, which got\r\nlarger or smaller as the girls joined it or waited outside. The girls\r\nbunched together all the time. None of the dancers ever took hands.\r\nThe so-called dancing consisted of a raising of both arms--the girls\r\nhad fans in their hands--and a simple attitudinising. The lads all\r\nclapped their hands together in time, but in a half-hearted kind of\r\nway; the girls struck the palms of their left hands with their fans.\r\nThe boys were in clean working dress. Some had towels wound round\r\ntheir heads, some wore caps and others hats. The girls were got up in\r\nall their best clothes with fine _obi_ and white aprons. The music was\r\ndirge-like. It was not at all what Western people understand to be\r\nsinging. The performers emitted notes in a kind of falsetto, and these\r\nfive or six notes were repeated over and over and over again. The only\r\nword I can think of which approximately describes what I heard, but it\r\nseems harsh, is the Northern word, yowling. First the lads yowled and\r\nthen the girls responded with a slightly more musical repetition of\r\nthe same sounds. For all the notice the boys appeared to take of the\r\ngirls they might not have been present. The lads and lasses were no\r\ndoubt fully conscious, however, of each other's presence. The dancing\r\ntook place on the nights of the full moon. But it was cloudy, and,\r\nowing to the big surrounding trees, the performance was often dimly\r\nlit.\r\n\r\nTo me the dancing was depressing, but that is not to say that the\r\ndancers found it so. Dancing began at eight o'clock and went on till\r\nmidnight. \"They would not be fit for their work next day if they\r\ndanced later,\" a sober-minded adult explained. This was only one\r\nsuggestion among many that the dance has been devitalised under the\r\nrespectabilising influence of the policeman and village elders who had\r\nforgotten their youth. To the onlooker it did not seem to matter very\r\nmuch whether the dance, as it is now, continues or not. Occasionally\r\none had an impression that it had once been a folk dance of vigour and\r\nsignificance. But the present-day performance might have been\r\nconceived and presented by a P.S.A. All this is true when the dance is\r\ncontrasted with an English West-country dance or a dance in Scotland\r\nat Hallowe'en. But it must be remembered that the _Bon_ dance during\r\nthe first nights is in the nature of a lament for the dead. There is\r\nsomething haunting in the strange little refrain, though it is\r\ndifficult to hum or whistle it. Perhaps the whole festival is too\r\nintimately racial to be fully understood by a stranger. By the end of\r\nthe festival, on the night of merrymaking in honour of the village\r\nguardian spirit, things were livelier. Some of the lads had evidently\r\nhad _saké_ and even the girls had lost their demureness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTHER AND CHILD]\r\n\r\nAfter the Buddhist _Bon_ season was over it was the turn of Shinto,\r\nand the village children were paraded before the shrine. A number of\r\nShinto priests in the neighbourhood took a leading part in making the\r\ncustomary offerings and the local priest read a longish address to the\r\nguardian spirit of the village. Respectful correctness rather than\r\ndevoutness is the phrase which one would ordinarily be disposed to\r\napply to the ceremonies at a Shinto shrine, but the local priest was\r\nreverential. The ceremonies of the day evidently meant a great deal to\r\nhim. The children paid a well-drilled attention. They also sang the\r\nnational anthem and a special song for the day under the leadership of\r\nthe school teacher, who played on a portable harmonium which sounded\r\nas portable harmoniums usually sound. The whole proceedings wore a\r\nsemi-official look.\r\n\r\nHappily there was nothing semi-official about the wrestling to which\r\nwe were invited later in the day. A special little platform had been\r\nput up for us. The ring was made on rice chaff and earth. The\r\nwrestlers squatted in two parties at opposite sides of the ring. They\r\ndid not wear the straw girdles of the professionals. Each man had a\r\nwisp of cotton cloth tied round his waist and between his legs. One of\r\nthe best things about the wrestling was the formal introduction of the\r\ncompetitors. A weazened little man with a tucked-up cotton kimono and\r\nbare legs, but with the address and dignity of a \"Nō\" player,\r\nproclaimed the names and styles--it seems that the wrestlers have a\r\nfancy to be known by the names of mountains and rivers--in a fashion\r\nwhich recalled the tournament. There was also another personage, with\r\na Dan Leno-like face and an extraordinary gift of contorting his legs,\r\nwho played the buffoon, and gyrated round the dignified M.C., who\r\nremained unmoved while the audience laughed. It was evidently the\r\nright thing for the prizes--they were awarded at the end of each\r\nbout--to be presented as comically as possible; and some of the\r\nShakespearean humours which appealed so powerfully to the groundlings\r\nat the Globe were enacted as if neither space nor time intervened\r\nbetween us and the Elizabethans.\r\n\r\nThe bouts were not so fast as professional wrestlers are accustomed\r\nto, but they were none the less exciting. The result was invariably in\r\nsome doubt and often entirely unexpected. The usual rule was that he\r\nwho threw his man twice was the winner. In some events, immediately a\r\nwrestler had been thrown, a succession of other contestants rushed at\r\nthe victor, one after the other, without allowing him time even to\r\nstraighten his back. Some of the competitors were poorly developed but\r\nthe lankiest and skinniest were often excellent wrestlers. At an\r\ninterval in the wrestling the committee flung hard peaches to\r\nwrestlers and spectators. I wanted to make some little acknowledgment\r\nof the kindness of the young men's association in providing us with\r\nour little platform, and it was suggested that autographed fans at\r\nabout a penny three-farthings apiece for about forty wrestlers would\r\nbe acceptable. This gift was announced on a long streamer. The funny\r\nman of the ring also made a speech of welcome. I may add that the\r\nyoung men's association had fitted up on the way to the scene of the\r\nwrestling a number of special lanterns which bore efforts in English\r\nby a student home for the holidays.\r\n\r\nI was told that the people of the village were \"honest, independent\r\nand earnest,\" and I am disposed to think that this may be true of most\r\nof them. As to honesty, we had the satisfaction of living without any\r\nthought of _dorobo_ (robbers). It is a great comfort to be able at\r\nnight to leave open most of the _shoji_ and not to have to pull out\r\nthe _amado_ (wooden shutters) from their case. The nature of our\r\npossessions was well known not only in the village but throughout the\r\ndistrict, for there was seldom a day on which a knot of grown-ups or\r\nchildren did not come to peer into our rooms. The inspection was\r\naccompanied by many polite bows and friendly smiles. On a festival day\r\nthe crowd occasionally reached about fifty.\r\n\r\nThere were formerly several teahouses in the village, but under the\r\ninfluence of the young men's association all houses of entertainment\r\nbut two had been closed. These two had become \"inns.\" In one of these\r\nthe girl attendant was the proprietor's daughter; in the other there\r\nwas a solitary waitress. One of the abolished teahouses had taken\r\nitself two miles away, where possibly it still had visitors. There\r\nseemed to be two public baths in the village, both belonging to\r\nprivate persons. The charge was 1 sen for adults and 5 _rin_ for\r\nchildren. At one of the baths I noticed separate doors for men and\r\nwomen; in the bath itself the division between the sexes was about two\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nThe smallest subdivision of the village is called _kumi_ or company.\r\nEach of these has a kind of manager who is elected on a limited\r\nsuffrage. The managers of the _kumi_, it was explained, are \"like\r\ndiplomatists if something is wanted against another village.\" The\r\n_kumi_ also seems to have some corporate life. There is once a month a\r\nsemi-social, semi-religious meeting at each member's house in turn.\r\nThe persons who attend lay before the house shrine 3 or 5 sen each or\r\na small quantity of rice for the feast. The master of the house\r\nprovides the sauce or pickles. I heard also of a kind of _kō_ called\r\n_mujin_, a word which has also the meaning of \"inexhaustible.\" By such\r\nagencies as these money is collected for people who are poor or for\r\nmen who want help in their business or who need to go on a journey.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the village is by every token well off. What are its\r\ntroubles? Undoubtedly the people work hard. I imagine, however, that\r\nthere are very many districts where the people work much harder. The\r\nforeigner is too apt to confuse working hard with working\r\ncontinuously. Whether outdoors or indoors, whether at a handicraft or\r\nat business, an Oriental gives the impression of having no notion of\r\ngetting his work done and being finished with it. The working day\r\nlasts all day and part of the night. Whether much more is done in the\r\ntime than in the shorter Western day may be doubted. During the brief\r\nsilk-worm season many of the women of the village in which I stayed\r\nare afoot for a long day and for part of the night, but the winter\r\nbrings relief from the strain of all sorts of work. Owing to the snow\r\nit is practically impossible to do any work out of doors in January,\r\nFebruary and March. The snow may stop work even in December. Here,\r\nthen, is a natural holiday. Whether with their men indoors the women\r\nhave much of a holiday is uncertain. But indoors should not be taken\r\ntoo exactly. There is some hunting in the winter. Deer come within two\r\nmiles and hares are easily got.\r\n\r\nWell-off though the village is, there is a strong desire to increase\r\nincomes. The people are working harder than they have done in the past\r\nbecause the cost of living has risen. An attempt is to be made to\r\nincrease secondary employments. Corporately, the village is said to\r\npossess 10,000 yen in cash in addition to its land. It is said that\r\nthis money is lent out to some of the more influential people. What\r\nthe security is and how safe the monetary resources of a village\r\nloaned out in this way may be I do not know, but there is obviously\r\nsome risk and I gathered that some anxiety existed.\r\n\r\nThe people of the village, like a large proportion of the population\r\nof the prefecture, are distinctly progressive. Nagano is full of what\r\nsomeone called \"a new rural type\" of men who read and delight in going\r\nto lectures. Lectures are a great institution in Nagano. For these\r\nlectures country people tramp into a county town in their _waraji_\r\ncarrying their _bento_. To these rustics a lecture is a lecture. A\r\nfriend of mine who is given to lecturing spoke on one occasion for\r\nseven hours. It is true that he divided the lecture between two days\r\nand allowed himself a half hour's rest in the middle of each three and\r\na half hours' section. He started with an audience of 500. On the\r\nfirst day at the end of the second part of the lecture it was noticed\r\nthat the audience had decreased by about 70. On the second day about\r\n100 people in all wearied in well-doing. But it was the townsfolk, not\r\nthe country people, who left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CRADLE]\r\n\r\nI found upon enquiry that in the village in which I had been living\r\nthere had been one arrest only during the previous year. The charge\r\nwas one of theft. Half a dozen other people had got into trouble but\r\ntheir arrests had been \"postponed.\" Two of these six delinquents had\r\n\"caused fire accidentally,\" two had been guilty of petty theft, and\r\nthe remaining two had sold things of small value which did not belong\r\nto them. During the twelve months there had been no charges of\r\nimmorality and no gambling. Perhaps, however, there may have been\r\npolice admonitions. It seemed to have been a long time since there had\r\nbeen a case of what we should call illegitimacy or of a child being\r\nborn in the first months of a young couple's marriage. Someone\r\nmentioned, however, that the girls who went to the silk factories\r\nwere, as a consequence of their life there, \"debased morally and\r\nphysically.\"\r\n\r\nA notable thing in the village was four fires, two the month before we\r\narrived and two while we were there. They were suspected to have been\r\nthe work of a person of weak intellect. (As in our own villages half a\r\ncentury ago, there is in every community at least one \"natural.\") On\r\nthe night of the first fire we were awakened about 3 a.m. by shouting,\r\nby the clanging of the fire bell and by the booming of the great bell\r\nin the temple yard. The fire was about four houses away. It was a\r\nstill night and the flames and sparks went straight up. As the\r\npossibility of the wind shifting and the fire spreading could not be\r\nentirely excluded we quickly got our more important possessions on the\r\n_engawa_--at least a young maidservant did so. The continual\r\nexperience which the Japanese have of fires makes them self-possessed\r\non these occasions, and this girl had _futon_, bags, etc., neatly tied\r\nin big _furoshiki_ (wrapping cloths) in the shortest possible time. It\r\nwas only when she was satisfied that our belongings were in readiness\r\nfor easy removal that she went to look after her own. The\r\nmatter-of-fact, fore-sighted, neat way in which she got to work was\r\nadmirable. With great kindness one of the elders of the village came\r\nhurriedly to the temple, evidently thinking we should feel alarmed,\r\nand cried out, \"_Yoroshii, Yoroshii_\" (\"All right\").\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRE ALARM AND OBSERVATION POST]\r\n\r\nAs I stood before the blaze what struck me most was the orderliness\r\nand quiet of the crowd and the way in which whatever help was needed\r\nwas at once forthcoming without fuss. The fire brigades were working\r\nin an orderly way and everything was so well managed that the scene\r\nseemed almost as if it were being rehearsed for a cinema. One\r\ndifference between what I saw and what would be seen at home at a fire\r\nwas that the scene was well lighted from the front, for the members of\r\nthe fire brigades carried huge lanterns on high poles. From the mass\r\nof old wet reed in the roadway I judged that the first act of the\r\nfiremen had been to use their long hooks to denude the roof of the\r\nburning house of its thatch, which in the lightest wind is so\r\ndangerous to surrounding dwellings. Nobody in the village is insured,\r\nbut the neighbours seem to meet about a third of the loss caused by a\r\nfire. It is an illustration of local values that a larger subscription\r\nthan 2 yen would not be accepted from me. In connection with this fire\r\nsomeone mentioned to me that incendiarism is specially prevalent in\r\nsome prefectures, while in others the use of the knife is the usual\r\nmeans of wiping out scores. The phrase used by a person who threatens\r\narson is, \"I will make the red worm creep into your roof.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the winter there is too much drinking--\"generally by poor\r\nmen\"--but there is said to be less of this than formerly. Some people\r\nstop their newspaper in the summer and resume taking it during the\r\ngreater leisure of the winter. It has been noted, among other small\r\nmatters, that the local vocabulary has expanded during the past\r\nfifteen years. During our stay the young midwife, who was going to\r\nAmerica to join her husband, was eager to give her service in the\r\nkitchen for the chance of improving her English. We also gave help in\r\nthe evenings thrice a week to one of the school teachers who had\r\nmanaged to obtain a fair reading knowledge of English. The earnestness\r\nwith which these two people studied was touching. While I was in the\r\nvillage the young men's association began the issue of a magazine.\r\nLithographic ink was brought to me so that I might contribute in\r\nautograph as well as in translation. The association, which receives\r\n10 yen a year from the village, cultivates several plots of paddy and\r\ndry land. The bigger schoolboys drilled with imitation rifles,\r\nimitation bayonets and imitation cartridges. I felt that I should know\r\nmore about the villagers if I could learn, like Synge, their topics of\r\nconversation when no stranger was present. One day while strolling\r\nwith a friend I asked him what was being said by two girls who were\r\nworking among the mulberries and were hidden from us by a hedge\r\n(hedges only occur round mulberry plots). He told me that one was\r\nenhancing to her companion the tremendous dignity of the Crown Prince\r\nby exaggerating grotesquely the size of the house he lived in, which\r\nreminded me of the servant who told her friend that \"Queen Victoria\r\nwas so rich that she had a piano in her kitchen.\" Generally the\r\nconversational topics of the villagers seemed to be people and prices.\r\nUndoubtedly, I was told, the subjects which were most popular,\r\n\"because they provoked hilarity,\" were family discords and sexual\r\nquestions. One man with whom I spoke about the morality of the village\r\nsaid cautiously, \"They say there are some moneylenders here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN AND OUT OF THE TEA PREFECTURE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF SORTS\r\n\r\n(SHIDZUOKA AND KANAGAWA)\r\n\r\nI am not of those who look for perfection amongst the rural\r\npopulation.--BORROW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe torrents that foam down the slopes of Fuji are a cheap source of\r\nelectricity, and, though the guide book may not stress the fact, it is\r\npossible that the first glimpse of the unutterable splendours of the\r\nsacred mountain may be gained in the neighbourhood of a cotton, paper\r\nor silk factory. The farmers welcomed the factories when they found\r\nthat factory contributions to local rates eased the burden of the\r\nagricultural population. The farmers also realised that to the\r\nfactories were due electric light, the telephone, better roads and\r\nmore railway stations. The farmers are undoubtedly better off. They\r\nare so well off indeed that the district can afford an agricultural\r\nexpert of its own, children may be seen wearing shoes instead of\r\n_geta_, and the agriculturists themselves occasionally sport coats cut\r\nafter a supposedly Western fashion. But the people, it was insisted,\r\nhave become a little \"sly,\" and girls return from the factories less\r\ndesirable members of the community.\r\n\r\nMention of these matters led an agricultural authority whom I met\r\nduring my trip in Shidzuoka to deliver himself on the general question\r\nof the condition of the farmer in Japan. He expressed the opinion that\r\n10 per cent. of the farmers were in a \"wretched condition.\" Big\r\nholdings--if any holdings in Japan can be called big--were getting\r\nbigger; it was an urgent question how to secure the position of the\r\nowners of the small and the medium-sized classes of holding. The fact\r\nthat many rural families were in debt, not for seed or manure but for\r\nfood spoke for itself. The amounts might seem trivial in Western eyes,\r\nbut when the average income was only 350 yen a year a debt of 80 yen\r\nwas a serious matter; and 80 yen was the average debt of farming\r\nfamilies in the prefecture of Shidzuoka. No one could say that the\r\nfarmers were lazy: they were working hard according to their lights.\r\nThey were working too hard, perhaps, on the limited food they got.\r\nThere could be no doubt that the physical condition of the countryman\r\nwas being lowered.\r\n\r\nAgain, there was the fact of the rural exodus--the phrase sounded\r\nstrangely in the middle of a Japanese sentence. As to the causes, the\r\nfirst unquestionably was that the farmer had not enough land on which\r\nto make a living. If the farmer could have 5 acres or thereabouts he\r\nwould be well off. But the average area per farmer in the prefecture\r\nin which we were travelling was a little less than 2-1/2 acres. High\r\ntaxes were another cause of the farmer's present condition. Then a\r\nyear's living would be mortgaged for the expenses of a marriage\r\nceremony. At a funeral, too, the neighbours came to eat and drink.\r\nThey took charge of the kitchen and even ordered in food. (After a\r\nJapanese feast the guests are given at their departure the food that\r\nis left over.) Further, some farmers wasted their substance on the\r\nambitions of local politics. Again, conscripts who had gone off to the\r\narmy hatless and wearing straw shoes came home hatted and sometimes\r\nbooted. Military service deprived farmers of labour, and their boys\r\nwhile away asked their parents for money. Conscription pressed more\r\nheavily on the poor because the sons of well-to-do people continued\r\ntheir education to the middle school, and attendance at a middle\r\nschool entitled a young man to reduction of military service to one\r\nyear only.[198]\r\n\r\nThe countryside was suffering from the way in which importance was\r\nincreasingly attached to industry and commerce. Many M.P.s were of the\r\nagricultural class, but they were chiefly landlords, and they were\r\noften shareholders and directors of industrial companies. There was\r\nvery little real Parliamentary representation of the farming class and\r\nit had not yet found literary expression. There were signs, however,\r\nthat some landlords were realising that industry and agriculture were\r\nnot of equal importance. But the farmers were slow to move. The\r\ntraditions of the Tokugawa epoch survived, making action difficult.\r\nFinally, there was the drawback to rural development which exists in\r\nthe family system. But that, as Mr. Pickwick said, comprises by itself\r\na difficult study of no inconsiderable magnitude, and we must return\r\nto it on another occasion.\r\n\r\nIn one of my excursions I went over a large agricultural school, the\r\nboast of which was that of all the youths who had passed through it,\r\ntwenty only had deserted the land. I met the present scholars marching\r\nwith military tread, mattocks on shoulders, to the school paddies.\r\n\r\nI noticed schoolgirls wearing a wooden tablet. It was a good-conduct\r\nbadge. If a girl was not wearing it on reaching home her parents knew\r\nthat her teacher had retained it because of some fault; if she was not\r\nwearing it at school her teacher knew that her parents had kept it\r\nback for a similar reason. The girls when they come to school have\r\noften baby brothers or sisters tied on their backs. Otherwise the\r\ngirls would have to stay at home in order to look after them. I asked\r\na schoolmaster what happened when children were kept at home. He said\r\nthat when a child had been absent a week he called twice on the\r\nparents in order to remonstrate. If there was no result he reported\r\nthe matter to the village authorities, who administered two warnings.\r\nFailing the return of the truant a report was made by the village\r\nauthorities to the county authorities. They summoned the father to\r\nappear before them. This meant loss of time and the cost of the\r\njourney. Should the parent choose to continue defiant he was fined 5\r\nto 10 yen for disobedience to authority and up to 30 yen for not\r\nsending his child to school.\r\n\r\nI found that a local philanthropic association had provided the\r\nspeaker's school with a supply of large oil-paper-covered umbrellas so\r\nthat children who had come unprovided could go home on a rainy day\r\nwithout a parent, elder brother or sister having to leave work to\r\nbring an umbrella to school.\r\n\r\nIn the playground of this school there was a low platform before which\r\nthe children assembled every morning. The headmaster, standing on the\r\nplatform, gravely saluted the children and the children as gravely\r\nresponded. The scholars also bowed in the direction of Tokyo, in the\r\ncentre of which is the Emperor's palace. An inscription hanging in the\r\nschool was, \"Exert yourself to kill harmful insects.\" In another\r\nschool there was a portrait of a former teacher who had covered the\r\nwalls of the school with water-colours of local scenery. I noticed in\r\nthe playground of a third school a flower-covered cairn and an\r\ninscribed slab to the memory of a deceased master. Every school\r\npossesses equipment taken from the enemy during the Russo-Japanese\r\nwar, usually a shell, a rifle and bayonet and an entrenching spade.\r\n\r\nIn this prefecture I heard of young men's associations' efforts to\r\ndiscourage \"cheek binding,\" which is the wearing of the head towel in\r\nsuch a way as to disguise the face and so enable the cheek binder to\r\ndo, if he be so minded, things he might not do if he were\r\nrecognisable.\r\n\r\nOne day I made my headquarters in a town that had just been rebuilt\r\nafter a fire. Within four hours the blaze aided by a strong wind had\r\nconsumed 1,700 houses and caused the deaths of nine persons. The\r\ndestruction of so many dwellings is wrought by bits of paper or\r\nthatch, or the light pieces of wood from the _shoji_, which are\r\ncarried aflame by the wind, setting fire to several houses\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nBeside street gutters I came across little stone _jizō_, the\r\ncheerful-looking guardian deities of the children playing near; but\r\nthey looked as incongruous in the position they occupied as did a\r\nsmall shrine which was standing in the shadow of a gasometer.\r\n\r\nI heard of contracts under which girls served as nurse girls in\r\nprivate families. A poor farmer may enter into a contract when his\r\ngirl is five for her to go into service at eight. He receives cash in\r\nanticipation of the fulfilment of the contract.\r\n\r\nI was assured by a man competent to speak on the matter that a\r\ncertain small town was notorious for receiving boys who had been\r\nstolen as small children from their homes in the hills. Up to 30 yen\r\nmight be given for a boy. There might be a dozen of such unfortunates\r\nin the place. Happily many of the children obtained by this \"slave\r\nsystem,\" as my informant called it, ran away as soon as they were old\r\nenough to realise how they had been treated.\r\n\r\nI visited a well-known rural reformer in the village which he and his\r\nfather had improved under the precepts of Ninomiya. The hillside had\r\nbeen covered with tea, orange trees and mulberry; the community had\r\nnot only got out of debt but had come to own land beyond its\r\nboundaries; gambling, drunkenness and immorality, it was averred, had\r\n\"disappeared\"; there were larger and better crops; and \"the habit of\r\nenjoying nature\" had increased. The amusements of the village were\r\nwrestling, fencing, _jūjitstu_, and the festivals.\r\n\r\nI heard here a story of how a bridge which was often injured by stores\r\nwas as often mysteriously repaired. On a watch being kept it was found\r\nthat the good work was done by a villager who had been scrupulous to\r\nkeep secret his labours for the public welfare. Another tale was of a\r\npoor man who bought an elaborate shrine and brought it to his humble\r\ndwelling. On his neighbours suggesting that a finer house were a\r\nfitter resting-place for such a shrine, the man replied: \"I do not\r\nthink so. My shrine is the place of my parents and ancestors, and may\r\nbe fine. But the place in which the shrine stands is my place; it need\r\nnot be fine.\"\r\n\r\nIn travelling the roads notices are often seen on official-looking\r\nboards with pent roofs. But all of these notices are not official; one\r\nI copied was the advertisement of a shrine which declared itself to be\r\nunrivalled for toothache. The horses on the roads are sometimes\r\nprotected from the sun by a kind of oblong sail, which works on a\r\nswivel attached to the harness. Black velvety butterflies as big as\r\nwrens flit about. (There are twice as many butterflies and moths in\r\nJapan as at home.) Snakes, ordinarily of harmless varieties, are\r\nfrequently seen, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nMany of the people one passes are smoking, usually the little brass\r\npipe used both by men and women, which, like some of the earliest\r\nEnglish pipes, does not hold more tobacco than will provide a few\r\ndraws. The pipe is usually charged twice or thrice in succession. One\r\nnotices an immense amount of cigarette smoking, which cannot be\r\nwithout ill effect. There is a law forbidding smoking below the age of\r\ntwenty. It is not always enforced, but when enforced there is a\r\nconfiscation of smoking materials and a fining of the parents. The\r\nvoices of many middle-aged women and some young ones are raucous owing\r\nto excessive smoking of pipes or cigarettes.\r\n\r\nI looked into a school and saw the wall inscription, \"Penmanship is\r\nlike pulling a cart uphill. There must be no haste and no stopping.\"\r\nHere, as in so many places, I saw the well-worn cover and much-thumbed\r\npages of _Self Help_. I may add a fact which would be in its place in\r\na new edition of Smiles's _Character_. As a simple opening to\r\nconversation I often asked if a man had been in Europe or America. His\r\nanswer, if he had not travelled, was never \"No.\" It was always \"Not\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nIn these country schools most of the songs are set to Western tunes.\r\nSuch airs as \"Ye Banks and Braes,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" \"Annie Laurie,\"\r\n\"Home, Sweet Home\" and \"The Last Rose of Summer\" are utilised for the\r\nsongs not only of school children but of university students. Few of\r\nthe singers have any notion that the music was not written in their\r\nown land. A Japanese friend told me that all the airs I mentioned\r\n\"seem tender and touching to us,\" and I remember a Japanese\r\nagricultural expert saying, \"Reading those poems of Burns, I believe\r\nfirmly that our hearts can vibrate with yours.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have denied myself the pleasure of dwelling on Japanese scenic\r\nbeauties, I may not pause to bear witness to the faery delights of\r\ncherry blossom which I enjoyed everywhere during this journey. But I\r\nmay record two cherry-blossom poems I gathered by the way. The first\r\nis, \"Why do you wear such a long sword, you who have come only to see\r\nthe cherry blossoms?\" The second is, \"Why fasten your horse to the\r\ncherry tree which is in full bloom, when the petals would fall off if\r\nthe horse reared?\" A Japanese once told me that a foreigner had\r\ngreatly surprised him by asking if the cherry trees bore much fruit.\r\n\r\nOrange as well as tea culture is a feature of the agricultural life of\r\nthe prefecture. As in California and South Africa, ladybirds have been\r\nreared in large numbers in order to destroy scale. I saw at the\r\nexperiment station miserable orange trees encaged for producing scale\r\nfor the breeding ladybirds. The insects are distributed from the\r\nstation chiefly as larvae. They are sent through the post about a\r\nhundred at a time in boxes. The ladybird, which has, I believe, eight\r\ngenerations a year, and as an adult lives some twenty days, lays from\r\n200 to 250 eggs, 150 of the larvae from which may survive. Alas for\r\nthe released ladybirds of Shidzuoka! Scale is said to be disappearing\r\nso quickly that they are having but a hard life of it.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring prefecture of Kanagawa I paid a visit to a\r\ngentleman who, with his brother, had devoted himself extensively to\r\nfruit and flower growing. Their produce was sent the twenty-six hours'\r\njourney by road to Tokyo, where four shops were maintained. A\r\nconsiderable quantity of foreign pears had been produced on the\r\npalmette verrier system. The branches of the extensively grown native\r\npear are everywhere tied to an overhead framework which completely\r\ncovers in the land on which the trees stand. This method was adopted\r\nin order to cope with high winds and at the same time to arrest\r\ngrowth, for in the damp soil in which Japanese pears are rooted, the\r\nbranches would be too sappy. Foreign pears are not more generally\r\ncultivated because they come to the market in competition with\r\noranges, and the Japanese have not yet learnt to buy ripe pears. The\r\nnative pear looks rather like an enormous russet apple but it is as\r\nhard as a turnip, and, though it is refreshing because of its\r\nwateriness, has little flavour. Progress is being made with peaches\r\nand apricots. Figs are common but inferior. A fine native fruit, when\r\nwell grown, is the _biwa_ or loquat. And homage must be paid to the\r\nbest persimmons, which yield place only to oranges and\r\ntangerines.[199] In the north the apples are good, but most orchards\r\nare badly in need of spraying. Experiments have been made with dates.\r\nFlowers have a weaker scent than in Europe. A rose called the\r\n\"thousand _ri_\"--a _ri_ is two and a half miles--has only a slight\r\nperfume two and a half inches away, and then only when pulled. I met\r\nwith no heather--it is to be seen in Saghalien, which has several\r\nthings in common with Scotland--but found masses of sweet-scented\r\nthyme.\r\n\r\nOne of the horticulturists to whom I have referred was something of an\r\nAlpinist and was married to a Swiss lady. They had several children. I\r\nalso met an American lady who had had great experience of fruit\r\ngrowing in California, had married a Japanese farmer there, and had\r\ncome to live with him in a remote part of his native country. From\r\nsuch alliances as these there may come some day a woman's impressions\r\nof the life and work of women and girls on the farms and in the\r\nfactories of rural Japan. Many a visitor to the country districts must\r\nhave marked the dumbness of the women folk. Women were often present\r\nat the conversations I had in country places, but they seldom put in a\r\nword. I was received one day at the house of a man who is well known\r\nas a rural philanthropist--he has indeed written two or three\r\nbrochures on the problems of the country districts--but when he, my\r\nfriend and I sat at table his wife was on her knees facing us two\r\nrooms off. Every instructed person knows that there is a beautiful\r\nside to the self-suppression of the Japanese woman--many moving\r\nstories might be told--and that the \"subservience\" is more apparent\r\nthan real. But there is certainly unmerited suffering. The men and\r\nwomen of the Far East seem to be gentler and simpler, however, than\r\nthe vehement and demonstrative folk of the West, and conditions which\r\nappear to the foreign observer to be unjust and unbearable cannot be\r\neasily and accurately interpreted in Western terms. At present many\r\nwomen who are conscious of the situation of their sex see no means of\r\nimprovement by their own efforts. But the development of the women's\r\nmovement is proceeding in some directions at a surprising pace. Many\r\nyoung men are sincerely desirous to do their part in bringing about\r\ngreater freedom. They realise what is undoubtedly true that not a few\r\nthings which urgently need changing in Japan must be changed by men\r\nand women working together.\r\n\r\nMoney has always been forthcoming, officially, semi-officially and\r\nprivately, for sending to America and Europe numbers of intelligent\r\nyoung men and women. So disciplined and studious are most of these\r\nyoung people that their country has had back with interest every yen\r\nof the funds so wisely provided. We have much to learn from Japanese\r\nmethods in this matter of well-considered post-graduate foreign\r\ntravel.[200]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198] See Appendix LXIII.\r\n\r\n[199] See Appendix LV.\r\n\r\n[200] See Appendix LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nGREEN TEA AND BLACK\r\n\r\n(SHIDZUOKA)\r\n\r\nThings I would know but am forbid\r\nBy time and briefness.\r\n\r\nLAURENCE BINYON\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than half of the tea grown in Japan comes from the hilly\r\ncoast-wise prefecture of Shidzuoka through which every traveller\r\npasses on his journey from Kobe or Kyoto to Tokyo. He sees a terraced\r\ncultivation of tea and fruit carried up to the skyline. But there is\r\nmore tea on the hills than the passenger in the train imagines. When\r\nviewed from below much of the tea looks like scrub. In various parts\r\nof southern Japan patches of tea may be noticed growing on little\r\nislands in the paddies, but tea is a hill plant and it is on the sides\r\nof hills and on the plateaus at the top of them that the plantations\r\nare to be found.\r\n\r\nTea looks not unlike privet and grows or is made to grow like box to a\r\nheight which can be conveniently picked over. The rows of neat-looking\r\nplants are half a dozen feet apart. The first picking may take place\r\nwhen the bush is three or four years old. Bushes may last forty, fifty\r\nor even a hundred years, but the ordinary life of tea is between\r\ntwenty and thirty. A bush is usually cut back every ten years or so. A\r\ngood deal depends on the pruning. After each picking the bushes are\r\ncut over with the shears just as we trim box. These trimmings may be\r\nused to make an inferior tea for farmhouse consumption, or they may be\r\nutilised in the manufacture of caffeine or theine--the two products\r\nare indistinguishable. Usually the bushes are cut round-topped, but\r\noccasionally they are roof-shaped and sometimes they are like giant\r\ngreen toadstools.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of a tea district beyond the rows of tea\r\nbushes is the chimney piping of the farmhouses which manufacture their\r\nown tea. (The word manufacture is used in the original sense, for\r\nfarmhouse tea is hand-made.) In a country where the houses are\r\nchimneyless these galvanised iron chimneys are conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe picking of the tea seems to be done almost entirely by women and\r\nchildren. The pickers are supposed to take only the three leaves at\r\nthe tips. But the pickers mostly take bigger pieces, for the somewhat\r\nhigher price given for good picking is not enough to secure three-leaf\r\nstuff only. It is not absolutely necessary, however, that the leaves\r\ngathered should be all of such a choice sort.\r\n\r\nWomen and girls come from a distance to pick tea. Picking is regarded\r\nas \"polite labour by the daughters of the higher middle class of\r\nfarmers.\" It has also the attraction that farmers' sons have a way of\r\nvisiting tea gardens in order to \"pick up wives.\" The girls certainly\r\ngive would-be husbands every chance of seeing what they can do, for\r\nthey are at work for a long day, often of from twelve to fourteen\r\nhours. In such a day it is possible, I was told, to pick 50, 80 or\r\neven 100 lbs. of leaves. One man put the rate as from 50 to 120 pieces\r\na minute. Four pounds of leaves make a pound of tea.\r\n\r\nIn one district the first picking may take place during the first\r\nthree weeks of May. In colder districts it is proceeding until the end\r\nof the month. The second season is from the end of June until the\r\nbeginning of July. The third is in August. The bushes, after producing\r\ntheir three crops of leaves, bear in November their seeds, which are\r\nabout three-quarters of an inch in diameter and are worth about a sen\r\na pound. Oil is pressed from them.\r\n\r\nGood tea depends on climate and soil, careful cutting over and good\r\nmanuring. In some places I saw soya bean being grown between the rows\r\nas green manuring. Like so many other crops, tea is or ought to be\r\nsprayed. The northern limit of tea is Niigata, where the bushes must\r\nbe protected from the snow, which may fall in that prefecture to a\r\ngreat depth. The region in which tea cannot be grown is that in which\r\nthe temperature falls below zero for two months. Tea is not grown, as\r\nin India and Ceylon, by tea planters, but in small areas and as a\r\nside-line at that. I never saw a plantation of more than five acres.\r\nMost areas are much smaller. The chief reason for this is that tea is\r\nlargely manufactured on the day on which it is picked and the capacity\r\nof a farmer's tea manufacturing equipment is limited. In Shidzuoka\r\nnearly a quarter of the tea is hand rolled and three-quarters made by\r\nmachinery. Elsewhere in Japan half the crop may be hand rolled.\r\n\r\nWhen leaves are sold to factors the transactions take place in booths\r\nopened by them in the tea districts. It is a busy scene in the region\r\nof the cottage factories. One is on a wide plateau covered almost\r\nentirely with rows of tea plants. Here and there are parties of\r\nchattering pickers, their heads protected by the national towel.\r\nAgainst the blue hilltops on the horizon stand out the cottages of the\r\nfarmers with chimney-pipes smoking, the booths of the dealers, and, in\r\nevery patch of tea, the thatched roof over the precious sunken pot of\r\nliquid manure by which the tea bushes have so often benefited. On the\r\nroad one passes women with baskets on their backs, like Scotch\r\nfish-wives with their creels, men carrying two baskets suspended from\r\na pole across one shoulder, or a man and his wife hauling a barrow,\r\nall heavy-laden with newly picked leaves. Small horse-drawn wagons\r\ncarry the manufactured tea in big, well-tied, pink paper bales. On the\r\nwhole, although the labour is hard it seemed a better life having to\r\ndo with the fragrant tea than with the rice of the sludge ponds in the\r\nvalley below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RACK FOR DRYING RICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE CREMATORIUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOG HELPING TO PULL JINRIKISHA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTHOR, MR. YAMASAKI AND YOUNGEST INHABITANTS.]\r\n\r\nThe tea produced in Japan is principally green tea. Most of this is of\r\nthe kind called _sencha--cha_ means tea. An inferior article made out\r\nof older and tougher leaves is called _bancha_. The custom is for the\r\nmaid who serves _bancha_ to heat the leaves over the charcoal fire\r\njust before infusing. This gives it an agreeable roasted flavour. It\r\nis often served in a darker shade of porcelain than is used for\r\nordinary tea. There are also the finer teas, _kikicha_ (powdered tea)\r\nand _gyokuro_ (jewelled dewdrops), which is the best kind of _sencha_.\r\nBlack tea was being made experimentally when I first arrived in Japan.\r\nBrick tea (pressed to the consistency and weight of wood) may be green\r\nor black. Most of the exported tea, other than brick tea, goes to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"TORII\" AT FOX-GOD SHRINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECORD OF GIFTS TO A TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to state that the Japanese tea-tray does not include\r\na sugar basin, cream jug or spoons. It does include, however, a squat\r\noval jug into which the hot water from the kettle is poured in order\r\nto lower the temperature below boiling point. Boiling water would\r\nbring out a bitter flavour from the tea. Made with water just below\r\nboiling point the tea is deliciously soft, even oily, and has a\r\nflavour and aroma which cream and sugar would ruin. It is certainly\r\nrefreshing, and, when drunk newly infused, relatively harmless.\r\n_Bancha_ is made with hotter water than other tea. The handleless cups\r\nhold about half of what our teacups contain.[201] Tea is not the only\r\nplant used for making \"tea.\" One drinks in some parts infusions of\r\ncherry, plum or peach blossom.\r\n\r\nThe processes of tea manufacture in farmers' outhouses and in\r\nfactories are described in school-books, and I need not transcribe my\r\nimpressions.[202] But I may note that some of the money the tea farmer\r\nearns for the country is spent in his interests. There is in Shidzuoka\r\na well-directed prefectural experiment station which exercises itself\r\nover problems of tea production. Every tea grower and tea dealer in\r\nthe prefecture must belong to the prefectural tea guild. He must also\r\nbelong to his county tea guild. The rules of the guilds--there is a\r\ncentral guild in Tokyo--have the force of law. Evil doers in the tea\r\nindustry have their product confiscated. Tea dealers who do not carry\r\ntheir guild membership card are fined. It is not difficult to discover\r\ncolouring in tea if it is rubbed on white paper. The Government's part\r\nin subduing tea colouring was to seize all the dye stuff it could lay\r\nhold of which could be used for colouring tea.\r\n\r\nThe future of green tea depends almost entirely on the demand from\r\nthe growing population of Japan, but a taste for the \"foreign style\"\r\nblack tea--with condensed milk--is spreading. The cheap labour of\r\nIndia and China and the big plantations and factories of India have\r\ndiminished the Japanese green tea trade and the effort to produce\r\nblack tea is also met by foreign competition. I was told that China\r\ntea receives much sunshine while growing, and that there was most hope\r\nfor Japanese black tea when made from leaves grown in the extreme\r\nsouth. There is a difference between the Chinese and the Japanese tea\r\nplant and it cannot be got over by importing Chinese plants, for the\r\nclimate of Japan simply Japanises the imported sort.\r\n\r\nI found in the United States that green tea is bought, as it is no\r\ndoubt sold in Shidzuoka, on appearance. American housewives were\r\npaying for an appearance that matters little in an article that is not\r\nto be looked at but soaked. Not only is much extra labour required for\r\nsifting the leaf several times in order to obtain a good appearance,\r\nbut the bulk is reduced from 5 to 10 per cent. The drinking quality of\r\nthe tea also suffers, for the largest leaf has usually the best cup\r\nquality. If teas were bought for cup quality only they might be at\r\nleast from 5 to 10 per cent. cheaper.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[201] At many stations one used to have handed into the carriage for\r\nless than a penny a pot of tea and a cup--you are entitled to keep\r\nboth pot and cup if you like. The tea-seller's kettle of water is kept\r\nhot with charcoal. Tea is freshly infused in each customer's pot.\r\n\r\n[202] For statistics and theine percentages, see Appendix LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCURSIONS FROM TOKYO\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY DOCTOR AND HIS NEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\n(CHIBA)\r\n\r\nWhat was yet wanting must be sought by fortuitous and unguided\r\nexcursions and gleaned as industry should find or chance should\r\noffer.--JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first went to Chiba, the peninsular prefecture lying across the\r\nbay from Tokyo, many carriages in the trains were heated by iron\r\n_hibachi_[203]with pieces of old carpet thrown over them. It is on the\r\nChiba trains that the recruits of that section of the army which has\r\nto do with the operation of the railways learn their business. It is\r\nin part of Chiba--and also in a district in Tokyo prefecture--that the\r\nearliest rice is grown. Chiba also contains more poultry than any\r\nother prefecture.[204] It has the further distinction of having tried\r\nto issue truthful crop statistics.[205]\r\n\r\nWherever one goes in Japan one is impressed by the large consumption\r\nof fish--fresh, dried, and salted. Thin slices of raw fish make one of\r\nthe tasty dishes at a Japanese meal. The foreigner, forgetting the\r\nWestern relish for oysters and clams, is repelled by this raw fish,\r\nbut a liking for it seems to be quickly acquired. In Tokyo the slices\r\nof raw fish are cut from the meaty bonito (tunny), but _tai_ (bream)\r\nis also used. Bonito also provides the long narrow steaks, dried to a\r\nmahogany-like hardness, which are known as _katsubushi_. This\r\n_katsubushi_ keeps indefinitely and is grated or shaved with a kind\r\nof plane and used much as the Western cook employs Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\nI heard a man in Chiba combating very strongly the idea of there being\r\na connection between leprosy and fish eating. As to leprosy, it is\r\ndoubtful if the belief expressed by the Chinese name for the disease,\r\n\"heavenly punishment,\" has disappeared. There are at least 24,000\r\nlepers in Japan, and as a well-known Japanese work of reference\r\ncasually remarks, \"the hospitals can at present accommodate only 5 per\r\ncent. of them.\"\r\n\r\nI could not but compare the undulating countryside, on which so vast\r\nan amount of labour had been expended, with what it would have been\r\nunder European treatment and the influence of an European\r\nclimate--possibly picturesque pasture with high hedges. The congeries\r\nof rice fields was fringed, where the water supply had given out, with\r\nupland cultivation. On the low mud walls which separated the paddies\r\nbeans grew except at a boundary corner, where a tea or mulberry bush\r\nserved as a landmark. In looking down or up the little valleys one saw\r\nhow completely the houses had been brushed aside to the foot of the\r\nlow hills so that no land cultivable as paddies should be wasted. This\r\nintensely developed countryside was not however ideal land. It was\r\noften much too sandy. Not a few paddies had to depend to some extent\r\non the water they could catch for themselves. A naturally draughty and\r\nhungry land was yielding crops by a laborious manurial improvement of\r\nits physical and chemical condition, by wonders being wrought in rural\r\nhydraulics and by unending industry in cultivation and petty\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that beauty had gone from the countryside. Some\r\nof what the land agents call the amenities of the district had\r\ncertainly disappeared. There seemed to be nowhere for the pedestrian\r\nto sit down in order to refresh himself with those rural sights and\r\nsounds which exhilarate the spirit. But this marvellously delved,\r\nmethodised and trimmed countryside had a character and a stimulus of\r\nits own. It reflected the energy and persistence that had subdued it.\r\nI saw nothing ugly. The tidied rice plots, shaped at every possible\r\ncurve and angle, and eloquent of centuries of unremitting toil; the\r\nupland beyond them, worked to a skilled perfection of finish; the\r\nnesting houses which nowhere offended the eye; the big still ponds\r\ncontrived by the rude forefathers of the hamlet for water storage or\r\nthe succour of the rice in the hottest weather; the low hilltops green\r\nwith pine because cultivation could not ascend so far, and hiding here\r\nand there a Shinto sanctuary: such a countryside was satisfying in its\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nIn Chiba, as in other prefectures, one is impressed by the way in\r\nwhich the exertions of many generations have resulted in the levelling\r\nof wide areas and even the complete removal of small hills. In many\r\nplaces one can still see low hills in process of demolition. In Tokyo\r\nitself several small hills have been carried off in recent years.\r\n\r\nI was in Chiba several times and I remember to have noticed one winter\r\nday with what considered roughness the paddies had been dug in order\r\nto receive from frost and sun the benefits which are as good as a\r\nmanuring. Some notion of the strength of the weather forces at work\r\nmay be gathered from the fact that, though I was walking without an\r\novercoat and was glad to shade my eyes by pulling down the brim of my\r\nhat, the frost of the two previous nights had produced ice on the\r\npaddies an inch thick.\r\n\r\nSometimes at the irrigation reservoirs one may see notice boards\r\nannouncing that these water areas are stocked with _koi_ (carp). This\r\nfish is also kept in the paddies. The carp are put in as yearlings or\r\ntwo-year-olds, when the paddies are flooded, and a score out of every\r\nhundred come out in the autumn--assuming the happiest conditions--ten\r\ninches or so long. Carp culture flourishes in the sericulture\r\ndistricts, where the pupæ which remain when the cocoons are unwound\r\nare thrown to the fish; but pupæ fed carp have a flavour which\r\ndiminishes their value. Indeed paddy-field fish, which on the whole\r\nmust have a rather troubled existence, do not bring the price of river\r\ncarp. Other fish than carp, eels for instance, are also kept in\r\npaddies.[206]\r\n\r\nI visited a vigorous personality who was at once a landowner and\r\nrural oculist, as his father and grandfather had been before him. He\r\nhad graduated at Tokyo and had kept himself abreast of German\r\nspecialist literature. There was accommodation for about a hundred\r\npatients in the buildings attached to his house. He believed in the\r\nefficacy in eye cases of \"the air of the rice fields,\" not to speak of\r\nthe shrine which overlooks the patients' quarters. As the number of\r\nblind people in Japan is appalling,[207] it was interesting to hear\r\nthe opinion that the chief causes were gonorrhœa, inadequate attention\r\nat birth, insufficient nourishment in childhood and nervous\r\ndisease--all more or less preventible. Nearly a quarter of my host's\r\npatients had had their eyes wounded by rice-stem points while stooping\r\nin the paddies. As the people are hurt in the busy season they often\r\nput off coming for help until it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe landowner-oculist's premises were lighted by natural gas from a\r\ndepth of 900 ft. According to a fellow-guest, who happened to be an\r\nexpert in this matter, natural gas is to be had all over Japan.[208]\r\n\r\nThe room in which I slept belonged to a part of the house which was of\r\ngreat age, but by my _futon_ there was laid an electric torch.\r\n\r\nA pleasant thing during my visit was the presence of a dozen\r\nintelligent, kindly students who early in the evening came and knelt\r\nin a semicircle round us, \"in order to profit by our talk.\" One of\r\nthem, a son of the house, an athlete (and now, after travelling in\r\nEurope, his father's successor), did all sorts of services for me\r\nduring my stay, in the simple-hearted fashion that shows such an\r\nattractive side of the Japanese character. One question asked by the\r\nstudents was, \"For what reasons does _Sensei_ believe that the\r\ninfluence of women in public life would be good?\" Another enquiry was,\r\n\"Which are the best London and Paris papers?\" These lads could hardly\r\nhope to get through the university before they were twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six. Yet, compared with our undergraduates, they had very\r\nlittle time for general reading, discussions and outdoor sports. I\r\nremember a man of some experience in the educational world saying to\r\nme, \"Our students do not read enough apart from their studies; it is\r\ntheir misfortune.\" They have not only the burden of having to learn\r\nnearly several thousand ideographs,[209] three scripts and Japanese\r\nand Chinese pronunciation. They have to acquire Western languages,\r\nwhich, owing to their absolute dissimilarity from Oriental\r\ntongues--for example, the word for \"I\" is _watakushi_--must be learnt\r\nentirely from memory. It is not that the Japanese student does not\r\nbegin early as well as leave off late. A professor once said to me,\r\n\"For some little time after I first went to school I was still fed\r\nfrom the bosom of my mother.\" In some ways it is no doubt a source of\r\nstrength for Japan that her men can spend from their earliest years to\r\nthe age of twenty-six on the acquirement of knowledge and\r\nself-discipline--the privileges of the student class and the\r\ngenerosity of their families and friends and the public at large are\r\nremarkable--but the disadvantages are plain. No sight seems stranger\r\nto a new arrival in Japan than that of so many men in their middle or\r\nlate twenties still wearing the conspicuous kimono and German bandsman\r\ncap of the student.\r\n\r\nTo return to our host, he told us that tenants were \"getting clever.\"\r\nThey were paying their rent in \"worse and worse qualities of rice.\"\r\nThe landlords \"encouraged\" their tenants with gifts of tools, clothes\r\nor saké in order that they might bring them the best rice, but the\r\ntenants evidently thought it paid better to forgo these benefits and\r\nmarket their best rice. This raises the question whether rent ought\r\nnowadays to be paid in kind. Rural opinion as a whole is in favour of\r\ncontinuing in the old way, but there is a clear-headed if small\r\nsection of rural reformers which is for rent being paid in cash.\r\n\r\nOne thing I found in my notes of my talk with the landowner-oculist I\r\nhesitated to transcribe without confirmation. Speaking of the physique\r\nof the people, he had said that few farmers could carry the weights\r\ntheir fathers and grandfathers could move about. But later on a high\r\nagricultural authority mentioned to me that it had been found\r\nnecessary to reduce the weight of a bale of rice from 19 to 18\r\n_kwamme_ and then to 15--1 _kwamme_ is 8.26 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn the _oaza_ in which I was staying there were eighty families.\r\nSeventy were tenants. Under a savings arrangement initiated by my\r\nhost, the hamlet, including its five peasant proprietors, was saving\r\n120 yen a month. On the other hand, more than half the tenants were in\r\ndebt \"in connection with family excesses,\" such as weddings, births\r\nand burials. But there might be unknown savings. I should state that\r\nthe villagers seemed contented enough.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other I was particularly struck by the sturdiness\r\nof the small girls. This was interesting because Chiba had for long an\r\nevil reputation for infanticide, and under a system of infanticide in\r\nthe Far East it would be supposed--I have heard this view stoutly\r\nquestioned--that more girls die than boys. The landowner-oculist was\r\nof opinion that in stating the causes of the low economic condition of\r\nhis tenants the abating of infanticide must be put first. People no\r\nlonger restricted themselves to three of a family. The average area\r\navailable locally was only 6 _tan_ of paddy and 1.2 _tan_ of dry land.\r\nIn a one-crop district in which there was work for only a part of the\r\nyear this area was obviously insufficient and there was not enough dry\r\nland for mulberries. Then taxation was now 2-1/2 yen per bale of rice\r\n(_hyō_). A third of the rice went in rent.\r\n\r\nI tried to find out what the _oaza_ might be spending on religion. The\r\nShinto priest seemed to get 5 sen a month per family, which as there\r\nare eighty families would be 48 yen yearly. The Buddhist priest had\r\nland attached to his temple and money was given him at burials and at\r\nthe _Bon_ season. The _oaza_ might spend 100 yen a year to send five\r\npilgrims as far away as Yamagata, on the other side of Japan. The\r\npriests did not seem to count for much. \"Their only concern with the\r\npublic,\" I was informed, \"is to be succoured by it. They are living\r\nvery painfully. The Buddhist priests have to send money to their sect\r\nat Kyoto.\" In one of my strolls I passed the Shinto priest carrying a\r\nrice basket and looking, as my companion said, \"just like any other\r\nman.\" At a shrine I saw a number of bowls hung up. A hole cut in the\r\nbottom of each seemed a pathetic symbol of need, material or\r\nspiritual.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the teahouse in the _oaza_ had been given a small sum by\r\nour host to take himself off, but in the village of which the _oaza_\r\nformed a part there were two teahouses, where ten times as much was\r\nspent as was laid out on religion. No one had ever heard of a case of\r\nillegitimacy in the _oaza_ but there had been in the twelve months\r\nthree cases which pointed to abortion. It was five years since there\r\nhad been an arrest. The young men's association helped twice a year\r\nfamilies whose boys had been conscripted.\r\n\r\nAccording to what I was told in various quarters, some landowners in\r\nChiba did a certain amount of public work but most devoted themselves\r\nto indoor trivialities. The fact that two banks had recently broken at\r\nthe next town, one for a quarter of a million yen, and that a\r\nlandowner had lost a total of 30,000 yen in these smashes, seemed to\r\nshow that there was a certain amount of money somewhere in the\r\ndistrict. No one appeared to \"waste time on politics.\" In ten years\r\n\"there had been one or two politicians,\" but \"one member of Parliament\r\nset a wholesome example by losing a great deal of money in politics.\"\r\nAs to local politics, election to the prefectural assembly seemed to\r\ncost about 500 yen. Membership of the village assembly might mean \"a\r\ncup of _saké_ apiece to the electors.\"\r\n\r\nI was assured that this hamlet was above the economic level of the\r\ncounty. The belief was expressed that it could maintain that position\r\nfor three or four years. \"I do not feel so much anxiety about the\r\npresent condition of the people,\" my host said; \"they are passive\r\nenough: but as to the future it is a difficult and almost insoluble\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"The condition of our rural life is the most difficult question in\r\nJapan,\" said a fellow guest.\r\n\r\nIn one of the farmers' houses a girl, with the assistance of a\r\nyounger brother, was weaving rough matting for baling up artificial\r\nmanure. Near them two Minorcas were laying in open boxes. In this\r\nfamily there were seven children, \"three or four of whom can work.\"\r\nThe hired land was 8 _tan_ of paddy and 2-1/2 of dry. There was\r\nnothing to the good at the end of the year. Indeed rice had had to be\r\nborrowed from the landlord. The family was therefore working merely to\r\nkeep itself alive. But it looked cheerful enough. Looking cheerful is,\r\nhowever, a Japanese habit. The conditions of life here were what many\r\nWesterners would consider intolerable. But it was not Westerners but\r\nOrientals who were concerned, and what one had to try to guess was how\r\nfar the conditions were satisfactory to Eastern imaginations and\r\nrequirements. The people at every house I visited--as it happened to\r\nbe a holiday the mending of clothing and implements seemed to be in\r\norder--were plainly getting enjoyment from the warm sunshine.\r\nUndoubtedly the long spells of sunshine in the comparatively idle\r\nperiod of the year make hard conditions of life more endurable.\r\n\r\nIn a very small house which was little more than a shelter, the father\r\nand mother of a tenant were living. It is not uncommon for old\r\npeasants to build a dwelling for themselves when they get nearly past\r\nwork, or sometimes after the eldest son marries.\r\n\r\nI found a 1-_chō_ peasant proprietor playing _go_ and rather the worse\r\nfor saké, though it was early in the morning. A 3-_chō_ proprietor was\r\nliving in a good-sized house which had a courtyard and an imposing\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\nOn the thatch of one house I noticed a small straw horse perhaps two\r\nfeet long. On July 7 such a horse is taken by young people to the\r\nhills, where a bale of grass is tied on its back. On the reappearance\r\nof the figure at the house, dishes of the ceremonial red rice and of\r\nthe ordinary food of the family are set before it. \"The offering of\r\nother than horse food indicates,\" it was explained, \"that the desire\r\nis to keep the straw animal as a little deity.\" Finally the horse is\r\nflung on the roof.\r\n\r\nI went some distance to visit an _oaza_ of twenty families. It was\r\ndescribed to me as \"well off and peaceful.\" Alas, one peasant\r\nproprietor had gone to Tokyo, where he had made money, and on his\r\nreturn had built his second son a house with Tokyo labour instead of\r\nwith the labour of his neighbours. So the _oaza_ was \"excited with\r\nbitter inward animosity.\" Like our own hamlets, these _oaza_ in the\r\nsunshine, seemingly so peaceful, whisper nothing to townsfolk of their\r\nbickerings and feuds.\r\n\r\nOne of the thatched mud houses I came to was at once a primitive\r\nco-operative sale-and-purchase society and the clubhouse of the old\r\npeople of the _oaza_. The rent the old folk received from the society\r\nwas enough to maintain the building. The oldsters gather from time to\r\ntime in order to eat, drink and make merry with gossip and dancing.\r\nDancing is a possibility for old people because it is swaying, sliding\r\nand attitudinising, with an occasional stamp of the foot, rather than\r\nhopping and whirling. One of the best amateur dances I have seen was\r\nperformed by a grandsire. Such clubhouses, places for the comfort of\r\nthe ageing and aged, are found in many villages. Young people are not\r\nadmitted. The subscription to this particular clubhouse was 2 yen and\r\n3 _sho_ of saké on joining and 2 yen a year.\r\n\r\nAs we went on our way there was pointed out to me a house the owner of\r\nwhich had sold half a _tan_ of land for 120 yen and was drinking\r\nsteadily. He had tried to make money by opening an open-air village\r\ntheatre which owing to rain had been a failure.\r\n\r\nI visited an _oaza_ where all the land belonged to the man I called\r\nupon. He assured me that most of his tenants \"made ends meet.\" The\r\nremainder had a deficiency at the end of the year due to \"lack of will\r\nto save\" and to their \"lack of capital which caused them to pay\r\ninterest to manure dealers.\" A co-operative society had just been\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nIn looking at a map of the village to which some of these _oaza_\r\nbelonged I noticed many holdings tinted a special colour. These were\r\ncalled \"jump land.\" They consisted of land subdued from the wild by\r\nstrangers. The properties were regarded as belonging to the _oaza_ in\r\nwhich their cultivators lived.\r\n\r\nI walked through a bit of woodland which had formerly been held in\r\ncommon and had been divided up, amid felicitations no doubt, at the\r\nrate of half a tan each to every family. But the well-to-do people\r\nsoon got hold of their poorer neighbours' portions.\r\n\r\nIn a roughish tract I came on burial grounds. One portion was set\r\napart for the eight families which recognised the chief landlord as\r\ntheir head. The graves of lowlier folk seemed to occur anywhere. Each\r\ngrave was covered by a pyramidal mound of sandy earth with a piece of\r\ntwig stuck in it. Sometimes a tree had been planted and had grown. A\r\nchild's grave had some tiny bowls of food and a clay doll before a\r\nlittle headstone. By way of shelter for these offerings there was hung\r\non the headstone a peasant's wide straw hat. A large beehive-shaped\r\nbamboo basket over another grave was a reminder of the time when a\r\ngrave needed such protection in order to save the body from wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nI saw at a distance in the midst of paddies two tree-covered mounds, a\r\nlarge one and a small one. They looked like the grave mounds I had\r\nseen in China, but it was suggested that they were probably on an old\r\nfrontier line and marked spots at which ceremonies for scaring off\r\ndisease were performed.\r\n\r\nIn one place I found the people planting plum trees in order to meet\r\ntheir communal taxation. It was reckoned that the yield of one tree\r\nwhen it came into full bearing would defray the taxes of a\r\nmoderate-sized family.\r\n\r\nAn open space in a wood was pointed out to me as the spot on which\r\ndead horses were formerly thrown to the dogs and birds. Nowadays\r\nnotice was given to the Eta that a dead horse was to be cast away, and\r\nthey came and, after skinning the animal, buried the body. Farther\r\noff, on the high road, I saw an 8 ft. high monument to a local steed\r\nthat had died in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nOne of my further visits to Chiba was in the spring. The paddies,\r\nwhich had been fallow since November, were under water; but much of\r\nthe stubble had been turned over with the long-bladed mattock. The\r\nseed beds from which the rice is transplanted to the paddies were a\r\nvivid green. On the high ground I saw good clean crops of barley and\r\nwheat, beans and peas, on soil of very moderate quality.\r\n\r\nThe name of Funabashi at a station reminded me of a Japanese friend\r\nhaving told me that it was \"famous for a shrine and a very immoral\r\nplace.\" But I afterwards heard that the keeper of that shrine, \"acting\r\nfrom conscientious motives, gave up his lucrative post and died a poor\r\nman.\" It is said of one of the most sacred places in Japan that it is\r\nalso the \"most immoral.\" Kyoto which contains nine hundred shrines is\r\nalso supposed to harbour several thousand women of bad character.\r\n\r\nI passed a place where 25,000 Russian prisoners had been detained.\r\nThere was an old peasant there who told his son that he could not\r\nunderstand why so many Japanese went abroad at such great cost to see\r\nthe different peoples of the world. If they would only stay at home,\r\nhe said, they would see them all in turn, for first there had been the\r\nChinese prisoners, then the Russians and now there were the Germans.\r\n\r\nIn the uplands it was peaceful and restful to walk through the shady\r\nlanes between the tree-studded homesteads or along the road passing\r\nbetween plots of mulberry, tea, vegetables or grain, cultivated with\r\nthe care given to plants in a garden. In the herbage by the roadside,\r\nbut not among the crops I need hardly say, I noticed dandelions, sow\r\nthistles, Scots thistles, plantains and some other familiar weeds.\r\n\r\nIn the paddies some men wore only a narrow band of red cotton between\r\ntheir legs joined to a waist string, which, though convenient wear in\r\npaddies, was comically conspicuous. I recall a friend's story of a\r\nlittle foreign girl of seven who stayed with her mother in a Japanese\r\nhamlet and struck up a friendship with a kindly old peasant. One hot\r\nsummer day the child came home carrying all her scanty garments over\r\nher arm, and covered with mud to the waist. In answer to her mother's\r\nenquiries the child said, \"Well, mother, Ito San has all his clothes\r\noff, and I could not go into the paddy to help him with mine on.\"\r\n\r\nI visited an elementary school which was little more than a shed. The\r\nroofing was of bark and the paper-covered window shutters were of the\r\nroughest. It said much for the stamina of the children that they could\r\nsit there in bleak weather. An attempt had been made to shut off the\r\nclasses from one another by pieces of thin cotton sheeting fastened to\r\na string. But such essential furniture, from a hygienic point of view,\r\nas benches with backs had been provided, for it is considered by the\r\nnational educational authorities that kneeling in the Japanese manner\r\nis inimical to physical development. I noticed, also, that when the\r\nchildren sang they had been taught to place their hands on their hips\r\nin order that their chests might benefit from the vocal exercise. The\r\nearnestness and kindliness of the men and women teachers were evident.\r\nAll the teachers came to school bare-foot on _geta_.[210]\r\n\r\nThe sea was not far off and we went to the beach where there was\r\nnothing between us and America. My companion and I were carried over\r\nshallows on the backs of fishermen, wonderful bronze-coloured figures.\r\nAbove high-water mark heaps of small fish were drying. They were to be\r\nturned into oil and fish-waste manure. I saw an earthenware vase with\r\na hole in the bottom like a flowerpot and found that it was used, with\r\na rope attached to the rim, for catching octopus. When the octopus\r\ncomes across such a vase on the sea bottom he regards it as a shelter\r\nconstructed on exactly the right principles and takes up his abode\r\ntherein. He is easily captured, for he refuses to let go his vase when\r\nit is brought to the surface. Indeed the only way to dislodge him is\r\nto pour hot water through the hole in the bottom of his upturned\r\ntenement.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[203] The Japanese firepot, which is made of wood or porcelain as well\r\nas metal, contains pieces of charcoal smouldering in wood ash.\r\n\r\n[204] I saw poultry of the table breeds which we call Indian Game or\r\nMalay; the Japanese call them Siamese.\r\n\r\n[205] See Appendix LVIII.\r\n\r\n[206] In 1918 carp was produced to the value of a million and a half\r\nyen and eels to the value of nearly a million.\r\n\r\n[207] See Appendix LIX.\r\n\r\n[208] See Appendix LX.\r\n\r\n[209] To cite a word already used in these pages, there are half a\r\ndozen words spelt _ko_ and as many as fourteen spelt _kō_, but all\r\nhave a different ideograph. When the prolongation of the educational\r\ncourse by the ideographs is dwelt on, it is wholesome for us to\r\nremember Professor Gilbert Murray's declaration that \"English spelling\r\nentails a loss of one year in the child's school time.\" Other\r\nauthorities have considered the loss to be much more.\r\n\r\n[210] For statistics of stamina, heights and weights of children, see\r\nAppendix LXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBANDMAN, THE WRESTLER AND THE CARPENTER\r\n\r\n(SAITAMA, GUMMA AND TOKYO)\r\n\r\nWe are here to search the wounds of the realm, not to skim them\r\nover.--BACON\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in the third week of October when the roads were sprinkled\r\nwith fallen leaves I made an excursion into the Kwanto plain and\r\npassed from the prefecture of Tokyo into that of Saitama.[211] The\r\nweather now made it necessary for Japanese to wear double kimonos.\r\nDuring the middle of the day, however, I was glad to walk with my\r\njacket over my arm, and many little boys and girls were running about\r\nnaked. The region visited had a naturally well-drained dark soil,\r\ncomposed of river silt, of volcanic dust and of humus from buried\r\nvegetation, and it went down to a depth beyond the need of the longest\r\n_daikon_ (giant radish). Sweet potatoes and taro were still on the\r\nground, and large areas, worked to a perfect tilth, had been sown or\r\nwere in course of preparation for winter wheat and barley; but the\r\nmost conspicuous crop was _daikon_. There were miles and miles of it\r\nat all sorts of stages from newly transplanted rows to roots ready for\r\npulling. There is _daikon_ production up to the value of about a\r\nmillion yen. In addition to the roots sent into Tokyo, there is a\r\nlarge export trade in _daikon_ salted in casks.\r\n\r\nI came into a district where there was a system of alternate grain and\r\nwood crops. The rotation was barley and wheat for three or four years,\r\nthen fuel wood for about fifteen. The tendency was to lengthen the\r\ncorn period in the rotation.\r\n\r\nThe women even as near Tokyo as this wore blue cotton trousers like\r\nthe men. One farm-house I entered was a century old but it had not\r\nbeen more than forty years on its present site. It had been\r\ntransported three miles. I was once more impressed by the low standard\r\nof living. If by this time I had not been getting to know something of\r\nthe ways of the farmers I should have found it difficult to credit the\r\nfact that a household I visited was worth ten thousand yen.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes are here much the most important crop. They were\r\nbringing the farmer in Tokyo a little over a yen the 82 lbs. bale. The\r\nconsumer was paying double that. Not a few of the farmers were\r\ncultivating as much as 5 _chō_ or even 8 _chō_, for there was little\r\npaddy. Even then, I was told, \"it's a very hard life for a third of\r\nthe farmers.\" The reason was that there was no remunerative winter\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nBefore the Buddhist temple, where there was preaching twice a year,\r\nwere rows of little stone figures, many of which had lost their heads.\r\nThe heads were in much demand among gamblers who value them as\r\nmascots. Among some mulberry plots belonging to different owners I saw\r\na little wooden shrine, evidently for the general good. It was there,\r\nit was explained, \"not because of belief but of custom.\" The evening\r\nwas drawing in and Fuji showed itself blue and mystical above the dark\r\ngreenery of the country. As I gazed a sweet-sounding gong was struck\r\nthrice in the temple. Three times a day there is heard this summons to\r\nother thoughts than those of the common task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE THE \"SHOJI.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC RICE POLISHER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR (AND THE KODAK HOLDER) IN THE CRATER OF A\r\nVOLCANO.]\r\n\r\nMy companion entered into conversation with a decent middle-aged\r\npedestrian, neatly but poorly dressed, and found that he was a man who\r\nhad formerly pulled his _kuruma_ in Tokyo. The man had found the work\r\nof a _kurumaya_ too much for him and had withdrawn to his village to\r\nopen a tiny shop. But he had been taken ill and had been removed to\r\nhospital. When he came out he found that his wife was in poverty and\r\nthat his eldest son had been summoned to serve in the army. Now his\r\nwife had become ill and he was on his way to a distant relative to ask\r\nhim to take charge of a small child and to help him with a little\r\nmoney to start some petty business. My companion gave him a yen and\r\ndeplored the fact that poor people should fail to take advantage of\r\nthe law releasing from service a son required for the support of a\r\nparent. They failed occasionally to find friends to represent their\r\ncase to the authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WAYSIDE MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIANT RADISH OR \"DAIKON,\" WHICH IS USED AS A\r\nPICKLE.]\r\n\r\nWhile waiting at the station we talked with another old man. He had\r\ncome to see his daughter whose husband had been called up for two\r\nyears' service. She was living of course with her parents-in-law. He\r\nsaid that his daughter would have no difficulty in keeping the farm\r\ngoing during the young man's absence, but his being away was \"a great\r\nloss.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man, who squatted at our feet as he spoke, went on to tell us\r\nabout a young man of his village who had served his term in the navy\r\nbut thought of remaining for another term. \"Gran'fer\" thought it a\r\ngood opening for him; he would not only get his living and clothes\r\nbut--and this is characteristic--\"see the world and send back\r\ninteresting letters.\" The ancient was specially interested in the\r\nsailor, he said, because his wife had \"given milk\" to the adventurer\r\nwhen an infant.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to enter a village which has not its pillar or its\r\nslab to the memory of a youth or youths who perished in the Russian or\r\nChinese wars.[212] But in the severe struggle with Russia the villages\r\ndid more than give their sons and build memorials to them when they\r\nwere killed. They tried, in the words of an official circular of that\r\ntime, \"to preserve the spirit of independence in the hearts of the\r\nrelieved and to avoid the abuses of giving out ready money.\" There was\r\nthe secret ploughing society of the young men of a village in Gumma\r\nprefecture. \"Either at night or when nobody knew these young men went\r\nout and ploughed for those who were at the front.\" In one prefecture\r\nthe school children helped in working soldiers' farms. In villages in\r\nOsaka and Hyogo prefectures there was given to soldiers' families the\r\nmonopoly of selling _tofu_, matches and other articles. Some of the\r\nsocieties which laboured in war time were the Women's One Heart\r\nSociety, the Women's Chivalrous Society, the National Backing Society\r\nand the Nursing Place of Young Children of those Serving at the Front.\r\n\r\nIn the train we talked of the hardiness induced by not being the slave\r\nof clothing. When it rains _kuruma_ men and workmen habitually roll up\r\ntheir kimonos round their loins, or if they are wearing trousers, take\r\nthem off.[213] Of course no Japanese believes in catching cold through\r\ngetting his feet wet. This is a condition which is continually\r\nexperienced, for the cotton _tabi_ are wet through at every shower.\r\nSome years back it was not uncommon in walking along the sea-beach at\r\nnight to find fishermen sleeping out on the sand. An old man told me\r\nthat it used to be the custom in his sea-shore hamlet for all members\r\nof a family to sleep on the beach except fathers, mothers and infants.\r\n\r\nOn my return from the country I found myself in a company of earnest\r\nrural reformers who were discussing a plan of State colonisation for\r\nthe inhabitants of some villages where everything had been lost in a\r\nvolcanic eruption. Families had been given a tract of forest land, 15\r\nyen for a cottage, 45 yen for tools and implements and the cost of\r\nfood for ten months (reckoned at 8 sen per adult and 7 sen per child\r\nper day). During the evening I was shown the figure of a goddess of\r\nfarming venerated by the afflicted folk. The deity was represented\r\nstanding on bales of rice, with a bowl of rice in her left hand and a\r\nbig serving spoon in her right.\r\n\r\nThe gathering discussed the question of rural morality. As to the\r\nrelations of the young men and women of the villages, to which there\r\nhas necessarily been frequent references in these pages, the reader\r\nmust always bear in mind the way in which the sexes are normally kept\r\napart under the influence of tradition. In nothing does this Japanese\r\ncountryside differ more noticeably from our own than in the fact that\r\njoyous young couples are never seen arming each other along the road\r\nof an evening. Thousands of allusions in our rural songs and poetry,\r\ninnumerable scenes in our genre pictures, speak of blissful hours of\r\nwhich Japan gives no sign. There is no courting; there are in the\r\npublic view no \"random fits of dallin'.\" An unmarried young man and\r\nyoung woman do not walk and talk together. A young man and woman who\r\nwere together of an evening would be suspected of immorality. Even\r\nwhen married they would not think of linking arms on the road. I was a\r\nbeholder of a family reunion at a railway station in which a young\r\nwife met her young husband returned from abroad. There were merely\r\nrepeated bows and many smiles. The view taken of kissing in Japan is\r\nshown by the fact that an issue of a Tokyo periodical was prohibited\r\nby the police because it contained an allusion to it. We are helped to\r\nunderstand the Japanese standpoint a little if we remember how\r\nrepugnant to English and American ideas is the Continental custom of\r\nmen kissing one another. Kissing is understood by the Japanese to be a\r\nsexual act, as is shown by their word for it.\r\n\r\nEarly in November in the neighbourhood of Tokyo, where three crops are\r\ntaken in the year and sometimes four or five, I found between the rows\r\nof growing winter barley two lines of green stuff which would be\r\ncleared off as the barley rose. The barley was sown in clumps of two\r\ndozen or even thirty plants, each clump being about a foot apart, and\r\nliberally treated with liquid manure. In Saitama 100 bushels per acre\r\nhas been produced by a good farmer. The clump method of sowing is\r\nbelieved to afford greater protection against the weather. (Outside\r\nthe volcanic-soil area ordinary sowing in rows is common.) The\r\nvolcanic soil, as one sees in spots where excavations have been made,\r\nis originally light yellow. The humus introduced by the liberal\r\napplications of manure has made it black.\r\n\r\nI came upon a hollow in some low hills, studded with trees and\r\noverlooking Tokyo Bay, which had been secured for the building of an\r\nelaborate series of temples at a cost of three million yen. Acres of\r\ngrounds were being laid out with genius. The buildings were of that\r\nbeautiful simplicity which marks the edifices of the Zen sect. The\r\nconstruction was in the hands of some of the cleverest master\r\ncraftsmen in Japan. The work was to be spread over four years. A great\r\nhoarding displayed thousands of wooden tablets bearing the names and\r\nthe amounts of the subscriptions of the faithful. In one of the\r\ncompleted temples a kindly priest was preaching. He added to the force\r\nof his gestures by the use of a fan. He was being attentively listened\r\nto by an intelligent-looking congregation. I caught the injunction\r\nthat in the attainment of goodness aspiration was little worth without\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe method of announcing subscriptions on hoardings was also adopted\r\noutside the new primary school near by. The subscriptions were from a\r\nhundred yen to one yen. The charge to scholars at this school, I\r\nfound, was 10 sen per month during the first compulsory six years and\r\n30 sen during the next two years.\r\n\r\nJust after Christmas I walked again into the country. There were miles\r\nof dreary brown paddies with the stubble in puddles. On the non-paddy\r\nland there was the refreshing green of young corn which seemed greatly\r\nto enjoy being treated as a garden plant in a deep exquisitely worked\r\nsoil with never a weed in an acre. But children were kept from school\r\nbecause their parents could not get along without their help. Many of\r\nthe school teachers seemed as poor as the farmers. As I passed the\r\nfarm-houses in the evening they seemed bleak and uninviting. In the\r\nfire hole[214] of every house, however, there was a generous blaze and\r\nthe bath tub out-of-doors was steaming for the customary evening hot\r\ndip in the opening.\r\n\r\nIn my host's house I noticed an old painting of a forked _daikon_.\r\nSuch malformed roots used to be presented to shrines by women desirous\r\nof having children.\r\n\r\nIn the office of one village I visited I was permitted to examine the\r\ndossiers of some of the inhabitants. Among a host of other particulars\r\nabout a certain person's origin and condition I read that he was a\r\nminor when his father died, that such and such a person acted as his\r\nguardian, that the guardianship ended on such and such a date, and\r\nthat his widowed mother had a child nine years after her husband's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIn not a few places I found that the tiny shrines of hamlets (_aza_)\r\nhad been taken away and grouped together at a communal shrine with the\r\nnotion of promoting local solidarity. At one such combination of\r\nshrines I saw notice boards intimating that \"tramps, pedlars,\r\nwandering priests and other carriers of subscription lists and\r\nproselytisers\" were not received in the village. It was explained that\r\na community was sometimes all of one faith: \"therefore it does not\r\nwant to be disturbed by tactless preachers of other beliefs.\"\r\n\r\nAt an inn there was a middle-aged widow who served there as waitress\r\nin the summer but in the winter returned to Tokyo, where she employed\r\na number of girls in making _haori_ tassels. (She gave them board and\r\nlodging and clothes for two years, and, after that period,\r\nwages.[215]) Remembering what I had written down about courting, I\r\nasked for her mature judgment on our rural custom of \"walking out.\"\r\nShe was amused, but, in that way the Japanese have of trying to look\r\nat a Western custom on its merits, she said, after consideration, that\r\nthere was much to be said for the plan. \"In Japan,\" she declared, \"you\r\ncannot know a husband's character until you are married. On the whole,\r\nI wish I had been a man.\" In order to catch our train we had to leave\r\nthis inn the moment our meal was finished, although the widow quoted\r\nto us the adage, \"Rest after a meal even if your parents are dead.\"\r\n\r\nOn a morning in May I went into the country to visit a friend who was\r\ntaking a holiday in a ramshackle inn 4,000 ft. up Mount Akagi. I\r\ncontinually heard the note of the _kakkō_ (cuckoo). On the higher\r\nparts of the mountain there were azaleas at every yard, some quite\r\nsmall but others 12 or even 15 ft. high. Many had been grazed by\r\ncattle. Big cryptomeria were plentiful part of the way up, but at the\r\ntop there were no trees but diminutive oaks, birches and pines,\r\nstunted and lichen covered, the topmost branches broken off by the\r\nterrific blasts which from time to time sweep along the top of the\r\nextinct volcano.\r\n\r\nOne of the products of rural Japan is the wrestler. _Sumo_, which is\r\ngoing on in every school and college of the country, exhibits its\r\nperfect flower twice a year in the January and May ten-days-long\r\ntournaments in the capital. The immense rotunda of the wrestlers'\r\nassociation suggests a rather rickety Albert Hall and holds 13,000\r\npeople.[216] On the day I went in I paid 2 yen and had only standing\r\nroom. Everybody knows the more than Herculean proportions of the\r\nwrestlers in comparison with the rest of their countrymen. The\r\nrigorous training, Gargantuan feeding and somewhat severe discipline\r\nof the wrestlers enable them to grow beyond the average stature and to\r\na girth, protected by enormously developed abdominal muscles, which\r\nreinforces strength with great weight.[217]\r\n\r\nI had often the opportunity at a railway station or in a train to\r\nwitness the easy carriage and magnificent pride of these massive,\r\ngood-tempered men. There is not in the world, probably, a more\r\nremarkable illustration than they afford of what superior physical\r\ntraining and superior feeding can do. At first sight, indeed, these\r\ngigantic creatures seem to belong to a different race. It is no wonder\r\nthat they should be so commonly proteges of the rich and\r\ndistinguished. When an eminent wrestler retired in the year in which I\r\nfirst saw a good wrestling bout the ceremony of cutting his hair--for,\r\nlike Samson, the wrestler wears his hair long--was performed by a\r\npersonage who combined the dignities of an admiral and a peer. There\r\nis nothing of the bruiser in the looks of the smooth-faced wrestlers.\r\nMany, however, are the bruises to their bodies and to their\r\nself-esteem which they receive in their disciplinary progress from the\r\ncontests of their native villages through all the grades of their\r\nprofession to the highest rank. Their sexual morality is commonly of\r\nthe lowest.\r\n\r\nIn my own hamlet at home in England I have seen the shoemaker, tailor\r\nand carpenter successively pass away; the only craftsman left is the\r\nsmith. In Japan the hereditary craftsman survives for a while. I\r\nwatched in my house one day the labours of such a worker. He was not\r\narrayed in a Sunday suit fallen to the greasy bagginess of everyday\r\nwear, topped by a soiled collar. He appeared in a blue cotton\r\njacket-length kimono and tight-fitting trousers of the same stuff, and\r\nboth garments, which were washed at least once a week, were admirably\r\nfitted to their wearer's work. Almost the same rig was worn by our own\r\nmedieval and pre-medieval workmen. The carpenter had on the back of\r\nhis coat the name of his master or guild in decorative Chinese\r\ncharacters in white. There are nowadays in the cities many inferior\r\nworkers, but all the men who came to my house worked with rapidity and\r\nconcentration, hardly ever lifting their eyes from their jobs. The\r\ndexterity of the Japanese workman is seldom exaggerated. To his\r\ndexterity he adds the considerable advantage of having more than two\r\nhands, for he uses his feet together or singly. His supple big toes\r\nare a great possession. We have lost the use of ours, but the Japanese\r\nartisan, accustomed from his youth to _tabi_ with a special division\r\nfor the big toe, and to _geta_, which can be well managed only when\r\nthe big toe is lissom, uses his toes as naturally as a monkey, with\r\nhis paws and mouth full of nuts, gives a few to his feet to hold. The\r\nfirst sight of a foot holding a tool is uncanny.\r\n\r\nThe pitiful thing is that a modest, polite, cheerful, industrious,\r\nskilful, and in the best sense of the word artistic hereditary\r\ncraftsmanship is proving only too easy a prey to the new industrial\r\nsystem. It is a sad reflection that the country which, owing to her\r\nlong period of seclusion, had the opportunity of applying to all the\r\nthings of common life so remarkable a skill and artistry, should be so\r\nlittle conscious of the pace at which her industrial rake's progress\r\nis proceeding, so insensible to the degree to which she is prodigally\r\nsacrificing that which, when it is lost to her, can never be\r\nrecovered. It is no doubt true that when our own handicrafts were\r\ndying we also were insensitive. But because the Middle Ages in England\r\nencountered the industrial system gradually we suffered our loss more\r\nslowly than Japan is doing. Because, too, we never had in our\r\nbustling history the long periods of immunity from home and foreign\r\nstrife by which Japanese craftsmanship profited so wonderfully, we may\r\nnot have had such large stores of precious skill and taste to squander\r\nas New Japan, the spendthrift of Old Japan's riches, is unthinkingly\r\ncasting away.\r\n\r\nIt is at Christmas at home that we have in the Christmas tree our\r\nreminder of the country. It is on New Year's Day that in Japan a pine\r\ntree is set up on either side of the front gate, but there are three\r\nbamboos with it, and the four trunks are all beautifully bound\r\ntogether with rope. If the ground be too hard for the trees to be\r\nstuck in the ground, they are kept upright by having a dozen heavy\r\npieces of wood, not unlike fire logs, neatly bound round them. The\r\npines may be about 10 ft. high, the bamboo about 15 ft. To the trees\r\nare affixed the white paper _gohei_. Over the doorway itself is an\r\narrangement of straw, an orange, a lobster, dried cuttlefish and more\r\n_gohei_. A less expensive display consists of a sprig of pine and\r\nbamboo. Poor people have to be content with a yard-high pine branch\r\nwith a French nail through it at either side of their doorway. I have\r\nbeen ruralist enough to harbour thoughts of the extent to which the\r\nwoods are raided for all this New Year forestry. Some prefectures, in\r\nthe sincerity of their devotion to afforestation, forbid the New Year\r\ndestruction of pine trees.\r\n\r\nI remember the gay and elaborate dressing of the horses during the New\r\nYear holidays. I saw one driver of a wagon who was not content with\r\ntying streamers on every part of his horse where streamers could be\r\ntied: he had also decorated himself, even to the extent of having had\r\nhis head cropped to a special pattern, tracts of hair and bare scalp\r\nalternating.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to learn that a fine chrysanthemum show arranged in an\r\nopen space in Tokyo was free to the public. Some plants, by means of\r\ngrafting, bore flowers of half a dozen different varieties. Several\r\nplants had been wondrously trained into the form of _kuruma_, etc. Not\r\na few of the varieties exhibited were, according to our ideas,\r\natrocious in colouring, but many were beautiful and all were marvels\r\nof cultivation. Even greater manipulative and horticultural skill was\r\nrepresented in the chrysanthemums I saw at the Imperial garden party.\r\nA chief of a department of the Ministry of Agriculture told me that\r\nfrom a chrysanthemum growing in the ground it was possible to have a\r\nthousand blooms.\r\n\r\nIn a Japanese room the timber upright alongside the _tokonoma_ is\r\nalways a tree trunk in the rough. If it be cherry it has its bark on.\r\nThe contrast with the finely finished wood of the rest of the room is\r\narresting. It is said that the use of the unplaned upright is not more\r\nthan three or four hundred years old and that it had its origin in\r\n_Cha-no-yu_ affectations of simplicity.\r\n\r\nI was visited one evening by an agricultural official who had returned\r\nfrom a visit to Great Britain. He spoke of the \"lonelyism\" of our best\r\nhotels. In a Japanese hotel of the same class one's room is so simple\r\nand the view of the garden is so refreshing that, with the beautiful\r\nflower arrangement indoors, the frequent change of _kakemono_, the\r\nserving of one's meals in a different set of lacquer and porcelain\r\neach day and the willing and smiling service always within the call of\r\na hand clap, there comes a sense of restfulness and peace. The\r\ndrawback which the Western man experiences is the lack of any means of\r\nresting his back but by lying down and the inability to read for long\r\nwhile resting an elbow on an arm rest which is too low for him.[218] A\r\nJapanese often reads kneeling before a table.\r\n\r\nHere I am reminded to say that the development of the desire for books\r\nand newspapers in the rural districts is a noticeable thing, if only\r\nbecause it is new. It is not so long ago that reading was considered\r\nto be an occupation for old men and women and for children. The\r\nsamurai had few books and the farmers fewer still. But the idea of\r\ncombining cultivation and culture was not unknown. I have heard a\r\nrural student humbly quote the old saying, _Sei-kō U-doku_\r\n(literally, \"Fine weather--farming--Rainy weather--reading\").\r\n\r\nI have a rural note of one of my visits to the _Nō_.[219] One farce\r\nbrought on an inferior priest of a sect which is now extinct but\r\nsurely deserves to be remembered for its encouragement of mountain\r\nclimbing. This \"mountain climber,\" as he was called, was hungry and\r\nclimbed a farmer's tree in order to steal persimmons. (The actor got\r\non a stool, obligingly steadied by a supposedly invisible attendant,\r\nand pretended to clamber up a corner post of the stage.) While he was\r\neating the persimmons he was discovered by their owner. The farmer was\r\na man of humour and said that he thought that \"that must be a crow in\r\nthe tree.\" So the poor priest tried to caw. \"No,\" said the farmer, \"it\r\nis surely a monkey.\" So the priest began to scratch after the manner\r\nof monkeys. \"But perhaps,\" the farmer went on, \"it is really a kite.\"\r\nThe priest flapped his arms--and fell. The farmer thought that he had\r\nthe priest at his mercy. But the priest, rubbing his beads together,\r\nput a spell on him and escaped. The word _Nō_ is written with an\r\nideograph which means ability, but _Nō_ also stands for\r\nagriculture.[220]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] The Kwanto plain (73 by 96 miles) includes most of Tokyo and\r\nSaitama prefecture, and also the larger part of Kanagawa and Chiba and\r\nparts of Ibaraki, Gumma and Tochigi.\r\n\r\n[212] The characters on these slabs are beautifully written. They have\r\nusually been penned by distinguished men.\r\n\r\n[213] The Japanese man wears below his kimono or trousers a pair of\r\nbathing shorts. Peasants frequently wear in the fields nothing but a\r\nlittle cotton bag and string.\r\n\r\n[214] Poor households ordinarily use, instead of movable _hibachi_, a\r\nbig square box in an opening in the floor and resting on the earth.\r\n\r\n[215] When I was in Tokyo, tradesmen's messenger boys received only\r\ntheir food, lodging and clothing and an occasional present, with help\r\nno doubt in starting a linked business when they were out of their\r\ntime. Now such youths, as a development of the labour movement, are on\r\na wage basis and receive 20 yen a month.\r\n\r\n[216] The place has since been burnt down. A bigger building has been\r\nerected.\r\n\r\n[217] See Appendix LXII.\r\n\r\n[218] There is also the occasional whiff of the _benjo_; but, as an\r\nagricultural expert said, \"It is not a bad thing that a people which\r\nis increasingly under the influence of industrialism should be\r\ncompelled to give a thought to agriculture.\" There are European\r\ncountries famous for their farming whose sanitary experts are\r\nevidently similarly minded.\r\n\r\n[219] The fact that Dr. Waley's scholarly book is the third work on\r\nthe _Nō_ to be published in England in recent years is evidence that a\r\nknowledge of a form of lyrical drama of rare artistry is gradually\r\nextending in the West.\r\n\r\n[220] Hence the names of the two national agricultural organisations,\r\nTeikoku Nōkai, that is the Imperial Agricultural Society, and Dai\r\nNippon Nōkai, that is the Great Japan Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\"THEY FEEL THE MERCY OF THE SUN\"\r\n\r\n(GUMMA, KANAGAWA AND CHIBA)\r\n\r\nI find the consolation of life in things with which Governments cannot\r\ninterfere, in the light and beauty the earth puts forth for her children.\r\nIf the universe has any meaning, it exists for the purposes of soul.--Æ\r\n\r\n\r\nOne December night there walked into my house a professor of\r\nagricultural politics, clad in tweeds and an overcoat, and with him a\r\nman who wore only a cotton kimono and a single under-garment. The\r\nsunburnt forehead of this man showed that he was not in the habit of\r\nwearing a hat. There is a smiling Japanese face which to many\r\nforeigners is merely irritating. It is not less irritating when, as\r\noften happens, it displays bad teeth ostentatiously gold-stopped. This\r\nman's smile was sincere and he had beautiful teeth. His hands were\r\nnervous and thin, his bearing was natural and his voice gentle. Here,\r\nevidently, was an altruist, perhaps a zealot, probably a celibate. He\r\nwas introduced as a rural religionist from Gumma prefecture set on\r\nreforming his countrymen. It is important to know the strength of the\r\nreforming power which Japan is itself generating: here was a man who\r\nfor eight years had lived a life of poverty in remote regions and had\r\nshaped his life by three heroes, \"St. Francis, Tolstoy and Kropotkin.\"\r\nHe believed that the way to influence people was \"to work with them.\"\r\nHe lived on his dole as a junior teacher in an elementary school. His\r\nfood, which he cooked himself, was chiefly rice and _miso_. He had\r\nbeen a vegetarian for ten years. He was twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nHe said that as far as the people of his village--largely peasant\r\nproprietors who hired additional land--were concerned, \"It is happy\r\nfor them if they end the year without debt.\" I asked how the men in\r\nthe village who owned land but did not work it spent their time. The\r\nreply was: \"They are chattering of many things, very trivial things,\r\nand they disturb the village. They drink too much and they have\r\nconcubines or women elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"If an ordinary peasant went to the next town to see women there,\" the\r\nspeaker continued, \"young men of the village would go and give him a\r\ngood knock. In former times 'waitresses' were highly spoken of in the\r\nvillage, but not now. There are some young men who may go at night to\r\na house where there are young girls in the family and open the door.\r\nSometimes they bring cucumbers. Cucumbers are symbols. Some do this\r\nout of fun and some sincerely to express their feelings. If the young\r\nmen who do such a thing do it out of fun they are given a good knock\r\nby members of that house when discovered. If they are sincere the\r\nmembers of the family will smile. There are in our village of 6,000\r\ninhabitants only four illegitimate children.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the influences exerted for the betterment of the people the\r\nfollower of St. Francis was convinced that \"when Buddhist influence,\r\nShintoism, Confucianism and the good customs of our race are all mixed\r\ntogether so that you cannot discern one from the other we have some\r\nliving power.\" His own religion was \"that of St. Francis combined with\r\nBuddhism.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally of rural people my visitor said: \"They are falling\r\ninto miserable conditions, are in effect spending what was accumulated\r\nby their ancestors. Their houses are not so practical and cost more.\r\nThey think they live better but their physical condition is not\r\nbetter. The number who cannot earn much is increasing.\" I was told of\r\na growing habit among village boys of running off to Tokyo without\r\ntheir parents' permission. And bands of girls came to the district to\r\nhelp in the silk-worm season \"often without their parents' approval.\"\r\n\r\nMany villagers consulted my visitor on all sorts of subjects until he\r\nhad almost no leisure. Some wanted counsel about the future of their\r\nchildren, some desired advice about the family debt, some wanted to\r\nknow how to put an end to quarrels and some asked \"how a man will be\r\nable to be easy-minded.\" The ordinary result of the primary school\r\nsystem was \"a mass of many informations in young brains and they\r\ncannot tell wisdom from knowledge. The result is that they are\r\ndiscontented with their hard lot. They grow up wishing to rob each\r\nother within the bounds of the law. They want to live comfortably\r\nwithout hard work. Good customs which were the crystallisation of the\r\nexperience of our race are dying away.\"\r\n\r\nMy visitor had met an old woman on the road clad miserably. She earned\r\nas a labourer on a farm, beside her board and lodging, 25 sen daily.\r\nOf this sum she handed to a fellow-villager whom she trusted 20 sen.\r\nHe gave away many clothes to the poor and her contribution was used\r\nwith the money he expended. \"If,\" said she, \"one shall give to God a\r\nsmall thing in darkness then it is accepted to its full value, but, if\r\nit be known, it is accepted only at a small value.\" She was \"content\r\nand quite happy.\"\r\n\r\nThis woman and many others in the district had a primitive kind of\r\nreligion. They observed the days called \"waiting for the sun\" and\r\n\"waiting for the moon.\" \"The same-minded people gather. The one most\r\ndeeply experienced tells something to those assembled and they begin\r\nto be imbued with the same spirit. It is some kind of transformed\r\nworship of the sun god. They feel the mercy of the sun. They do not\r\nworship the heavenly bodies but as the symbol of the merciful\r\nuniverse. These people take meals together several times in a year.\r\nThey talk not only on spiritual but on common things and about the\r\nnews in the papers. It may seem to a stranger that what they talk is\r\nfoolish, but they have a wonderful power to attract the essential out\r\nof those trifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fundamental power which made Japan what it is,\" the speaker went\r\non with animation, \"is not institutions and statesmen, but those\r\nprimitive religious acts. The people strongly resembling the old woman\r\nI spoke of may be only 1 per cent., but almost all villagers are\r\nimbued with such religious notions and feel thankfulness, and on rare\r\noccasions a latent sentiment springs from their hearts. Their religion\r\nmay be connected with Buddhism or Shintoism; it is not Buddhism or\r\nShintoism, however, but a primitive belief which in its manifestation\r\nvaries much in different villages. For example, in one village the\r\ngood deeds of an ancient sage are told. The time when that priest\r\nlived and particulars about him are getting dimmer and dimmer, but his\r\ninfluence is still considerable. Though many people are worshipped in\r\nnational and prefectural shrines the influence of those enshrined is\r\nsmall compared with the influence of a man or woman of the past who\r\nwas not much celebrated but was thought to be good by the rustic\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"Think of the way in which the memory of the maid-servant Otake is\r\nworshipped by the peasants through one-half of Japan. That was a pious\r\nand illuminated person who worked very hard. As her _uta_ (poem) says,\r\n'Though hands and feet are very busy at work, still I can praise and\r\nfollow God always because my mind and heart are not occupied by\r\nworldly things.' She ate poor food and gave her own food to beggars.\r\nSo when a countryman wastes the bounty of nature he is still\r\nreprimanded by the example of that maid-servant. She is more respected\r\nthan many great men.\"\r\n\r\nMy visitor thought a religious revival might happen under the\r\nleadership of a Christian or of a Buddhist, or of a man who \"united\r\nBuddhism and Christianity\" or \"developed the primitive form of faith\r\namong the lower people.\" He thought there were \"already men in the\r\ncountry who might be these leaders.\" He said that much might happen in\r\nten years. \"Materialism is prevalent everywhere, but people will begin\r\nto feel difficulties in following their materialism. When they cannot\r\ngo any further with it they will begin to be awakened.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then this young man who sincerely desires to do something with his\r\nlife and has at any rate made a beginning went his way. Up and down\r\nJapan I met several single-hearted men not unlike him.\r\n\r\nOne day I made an excursion from Tokyo and came on an extraordinary\r\navenue of small wooden red painted _torii_, gimcracky things made out\r\nof what a carpenter would call \"two by two stuff.\" By the time I got\r\nto the shrine to which the _torii_ led I must have passed a thousand\r\nof these erections. In one spot there was a stack of _torii_ lying on\r\ntheir sides. The shrine was in honour of the fox god and there was a\r\ncurious story behind it. Twenty years before a man interested in the\r\n\"development\" of the district had caused it to be given out that\r\nfoxes, the messengers of the god Inari, had been seen on this spot in\r\nthe vicinity of a humble shrine to that divinity. The farmers were\r\ncontinually questioned about the matter. It was suggested that the god\r\nwas manifesting his presence. In the end more and more worshippers\r\ncame, and, with the liberal assistance of the speculator, a fine new\r\nshrine was erected in place of the shabby one. His hand was also seen\r\nin the building of a big burrow--of concrete--for the comfort of the\r\ngod's messenger. The top of the burrow also furnished an excellent\r\nview of the surrounding district, and teahouses were built in the\r\nvicinity. Indeed in a year or two quite a village of teahouses came\r\ninto existence. The place, which was on the sea-coast, had become a\r\nkind of Southend or Coney Island, and attracted thousands of visitors.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of these teahouses would have great difficulty in\r\nestablishing a claim to respectability. Numbers of lamps which crowded\r\nthe space before the shrine were the gifts of women of bad character\r\nand the inscriptions on these gifts bore the _addresses and\r\nprofession_ of the donors. The final irony was the provision of a tram\r\nservice for the convenience of those who wished to worship at another\r\naltar than that of the fox god. Although most of the visitors found\r\nthe chief attraction of the place in the teahouses,[221] they were\r\nnone the less devout. Every visitor to the teahouses worshipped at the\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\nWhat do those who bow their heads and throw their Coppers in the\r\ntreasury pray for? \"Well-being to my family and prosperity to my\r\nbusiness\" was, I was told, a common form of invocation. Even among not\r\na few reasonably well educated people there is a conviction that\r\nprayers made at the altar of the fox god are peculiarly efficacious.\r\nKanzō Uchimura, who accompanied me on this trip, improved the occasion\r\nby saying in his vigorous English: \"You in the West have some\r\ndifficulty, no doubt, in understanding the fierceness of the\r\nindignation with which Old Testament prophets denounce heathen gods.\r\nWhen you behold such an exhibition as this you may be helped to\r\nunderstand. Here is impurity under divine protection, and this place\r\nmay fairly be called a fashionable shrine. The visitor to Japan often\r\nvaunts himself on being broadminded. He regards heathendom as only\r\nanother sect and he desires to be respectful to it. But I want to show\r\nyou that it is not a case of only another sect but often a case of\r\ngross and demoralising superstition and priestly countenancing of\r\nimmorality. Heaven forbid that I should deny the beauty of the idea of\r\nthe foxes being the messengers of divinity or that I should suggest\r\nthat some religious feelings may not inspire and some religious\r\nfeeling may not reward the sincere devotion of the countryman to his\r\nfox god, but how much does it amount to in sum?\"\r\n\r\nI thought of what Uchimura had said when one day, in the course of a\r\nwalk with his critic, Yanagi (Chapter XI), I was shown a shrine\r\npitifully bedizened by the _waraji_ (straw sandals) and _ema_[222] of\r\na thousand or more pilgrims who were suffering or had recovered from\r\nsyphilis.[223]\r\n\r\nDuring our conversation Yanagi said: \"Shintoism is not of course a\r\nreligion at all. It draws great strength from the national instinct\r\nfor cleanliness manifested by people living in a hot climate. The\r\nreligion of poor people is largely custom; I complain of educated\r\npeople not that they are sceptical but that they are not sceptical\r\nenough. They simply don't care. According to Mr. Uchimura, there is\r\nonly one way to God and that is through Christianity. But there are\r\nmany ways. A personal religion like Christianity is more effective\r\nthan Buddhism, but it does not follow that Christianity is better than\r\nBuddhism. I find I get to like Mr. Uchimura more and more and his\r\nviews less and less. It is not his theoretical Christianity but his\r\ncourageous spirit which attracts. He is a courageous man and we have\r\nvery great need of morally courageous men. Although Christianity is\r\nimpossible without Christ, Buddhism is possible without Buddha. A\r\nvariety of religions is not harmful, and we have to take note of the\r\nChristian temperament and the Buddhistic temperament. Orientals can\r\nonly be appealed to by an Oriental religion. Christianity is an\r\nOriental religion no doubt, but it has been Westernised. It must\r\nalways be borne in mind that Buddhistic literature is in a special\r\nlanguage and that it is difficult for most people to get a general\r\nview of Buddhism.\"\r\n\r\nIn further talk the speaker said that in Japan the individual had not\r\nbeen separated from the mass. But it was difficult to exaggerate the\r\nswiftness of the national development. The newer Russian writers were\r\n\"certainly as well known in England, possibly better known.\" As to\r\nTolstoy alone, there were at least fifty books about him. But it had\r\nto be admitted that, generally speaking, the Japanese development\r\nthough rapid had not gone deep. In painting there was dexterity and\r\ntechnique but few men knew where they were going. Their work was\r\n\"surface beautiful.\" They had not passed the stage of Zorn.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of conscription and I said that it had not escaped my\r\nattention that many young men showed an increasing desire to avoid\r\nmilitary service. From a single person I had heard of youths who had\r\nescaped by looking ill--through a week's fasting--by impairing their\r\neyesight by wearing strong glasses for a few weeks, by contriving to\r\nbe examined in a fishing village where the standard of physique was\r\nhigh, or by shamming Socialist.[224] Many Japanese bear\r\nuncomplainingly the heavy burden of the military system. But the\r\nothers are to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nSaid one of these to me: \"We Japanese are not inherently a warlike\r\npeople and have no desire to be militarists; but we are suffering from\r\nGerman influence not only in the army but through the middle-aged\r\nlegal, scientific and administrative classes who were largely educated\r\nin Germany or influenced by German teaching. This German influence may\r\nhave been held in check to some extent, perhaps, by the artistic\r\nworld, which has certainly not been German, except in relation to\r\nmusic, and after all that is the best part of Germany. Many young\r\npeople have taken their ideas largely from Russia; more from the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain. But Germany will always make her\r\nappeal on account of her reputation with us for system, order,\r\nindustry, depth of knowledge, persistence and nationalism.\"\r\n\r\nOn the family system, the study of which was more than once urged upon\r\nme in connection with the rural problem, this statement was made to me\r\nby an agricultural expert: \"I will tell you the story of an official\r\nwhose salary was that of a Governor. His father was a farmer. The\r\nfarmer borrowed money to educate his son. When the son became an\r\nofficial he paid the money back, but on the small salaries he received\r\nthis repayment was a strain. Then two brothers came to his house\r\nfrequently for money, and when they received it spent it in ridiculous\r\nways. This begging has gone on for nine years. My friend has to live\r\nnot like an Excellency but like a _gunchō_. He cannot treat his wife\r\nand children fairly. But of the money he gives to his brothers he\r\nsays, 'It is my family expense.'\"\r\n\r\nI also heard this story: \"A married B. B died without having any\r\nchildren. A next married B's sister, C. Then, because of the necessity\r\nof having a male heir for the maintenance of his family, and because\r\nhe thought it was unlikely that his wife C would have children as her\r\ndead sister B had had none, he adopted his wife's younger brother, D.\r\nBut the wife C did have children. Consequently, not only is A's wife\r\nhis sister-in-law and his eldest 'son' his wife's brother, but his\r\nchildren are his eldest 'son's' nephews. The eldest of these children,\r\nE, is legally the younger son. He says, 'I am glad that instead of an\r\nuncle I have an elder brother. I am much attached to him and he is\r\nattached to me. I am not sorry to be younger instead of elder brother,\r\nfor when my father dies my adopted brother will become head of the\r\nfamily and he must then bring up his younger brothers and sisters,\r\nmanage the family fortunes, bear the family troubles and keep all the\r\ncousins and uncles in good humour by inviting them occasionally and at\r\nother times by visiting them and giving them presents.'[225]\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that our family system, for speaking in criticism of\r\nwhich officials have been dismissed from their posts, puts too much\r\nstress on the family and too little on the individual. The family is\r\nthe unit of society. Any member of it is only a fraction of that unit.\r\nFor the sake of the family every member of it must sacrifice almost\r\neverything.[226] Sometimes the development of the individual character\r\nand individual initiative is checked by the family system. An eldest\r\nson is often required to follow his father's calling irrespective of\r\nhis tastes. Nowadays some eldest sons go abroad, but their departure\r\nattracts attention and you seldom find such a thing happening among\r\nfarmers. The family system, by which all is subordinated to family, is\r\nconvenient to farmers for it means increased labour and economy of\r\nliving. Sometimes there may be two married sons living at home and\r\nthen there is often strife. Generally speaking, the family system at\r\none and the same time keeps young men from striking out in the world\r\nand compels their early marriage so that the helping hands to the\r\nfamily may be more numerous. The family system concentrates the\r\nattention on the family and not on society. There is no energy left\r\nfor society.\r\n\r\n\"Again, the family system gives too much power to relatives and leads\r\nto disagreeable interference. In the case of a marriage being proposed\r\nbetween family A and family B, the families related to A or B who will\r\nbe brought into closer connection by the marriage may object. On the\r\nother hand, the family system has the advantage that the relatives who\r\ninterfere may also be looked upon for help. Not a few people are all\r\nfor maintaining the family system. But the spirit of individualism is\r\nentering into some families and here and there children are beginning\r\nto claim their rights and to act against relatives' wishes. One hears\r\nof farmers sending boys, even elder sons, to the towns, and for their\r\nequipment borrowing from the prefectural agricultural bank instead of\r\nspending on the development of their business.\"\r\n\r\nAt a Christmas-day luncheon I met four students of rural problems, two\r\nof whom were peers, one a governor of an important prefecture, and a\r\nfourth a high official in the agricultural world. One man, speaking of\r\nthe family system, said \"the success of agriculture depends on it.\"\r\n\"In my opinion,\" someone remarked, \"the foundation of the family\r\nsystem is common production and common consumption, so when these\r\nthings go there must be a gradual disappearance of the family system.\"\r\n\"No,\" came the rejoinder, \"the only enemy of the family system is\r\nWestern influence.\" \"Yes,\" the fourth speaker added, \"an enemy whose\r\nblows have told.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone suggested that the Japanese rural emigrant always hoped to\r\nreturn home, that is if he could return with dignity--does not the\r\nproverb speak of the desirability of returning home in good clothes?\r\nOne of the company said that he had seen in Kyushu rows of\r\nwhite-washed slated houses which had been erected by returned\r\nemigrants. \"But they were successful prostitutes. Often, however,\r\nthese girls invest their money unwisely and have to go abroad again.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody at table agreed that there was in the villages a slow if\r\nsteady slackening of \"the power of the landlord, of the authorities\r\nand of religion,\" and a development of a desire and a demand for\r\nbetter conditions of life. One who proclaimed himself a conservative\r\nurged that changes of form were too readily confounded with changes of\r\nspirit. The change in thought in Japan, he said, was slow, and some\r\noccurrences might be easily misjudged. I said that that very day I had\r\nheard from my house the drone of an aeroplane prevail over the sound\r\nof a temple bell, happening to speak of _The Golden Bough_, I asked my\r\nneighbour, who had read it, if to a Japanese who got its penetrating\r\nview some things could ever be the same again. He answered frankly,\r\n\"There are things in our life which are too near to criticise. Do you\r\nknow that there are parts of Japan where folklore is still being\r\nmade?\"\r\n\r\nI was invited one evening to dinner to meet a dozen men conspicuous in\r\nthe agricultural world. Priests were apologised for because most of\r\nthem were \"very poor men and also poorly educated.\" Very few had been\r\neven to a middle school. Many priests read Chinese scriptures aloud\r\nbut they did not understand what they were reading.\r\n\r\nOne man reported that an old farmer had said to him that paddy-field\r\nlabour was harder than dry-land labour, but young men did not go off\r\nto Tokyo because of the severity of the work; they went away because\r\nof \"the bondage of rural life.\"\r\n\r\nHow much has the economic stress affected old convictions? How general\r\nand how eager is the Japanese resolution to Westernise farther? None\r\nof the rural sociologists had given any thought apparently to a new\r\nfactor in the rural problem: the way in which compulsory military\r\nservice, in taking farmers' sons to the cities as soldiers and\r\nbluejackets, is giving them an acquaintance with neo-Malthusianism. In\r\nTokyo and other large cities certain articles are prominently\r\nadvertised on the hoardings. It is of some importance to consider what\r\nwill be the effect of this knowledge in competition with the national\r\nappreciation of large families.[227] Is it likely that an intensely\r\n\"practical\" people, which has bolted so much of European and American\r\n\"civilisation,\" will be wholly uninfluenced by the Western practice of\r\nlimitation of offspring? What is to-day the actual strength of the\r\nsocial needs which have produced the large Japanese family?[228]\r\nWhatever middle-aged Japanese may think, the matter is not in their\r\nhands, but in the hands of the younger generation. Most Western\r\neconomists would no doubt argue that if fewer babies arrived in Japan\r\nthere would not be so many farmers' boys and university graduates bent\r\non emigrating.\r\n\r\nWithout the voluntary limitation of families, however, the number of\r\nchildren born is likely to be diminished by the increased cost of\r\nliving and by the postponement of marriage. I know Japanese men who\r\nwere married before they were twenty; the younger generation of my\r\nfriends is marrying nearer thirty.[229]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the population has not increased of\r\nrecent years at the old rate.[230] A responsible authority expressed\r\nthe opinion to me that the necessities of the population are unlikely\r\nto overtake the means of production in the near future.[231]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are intensely practical, but they have, as we have seen,\r\nanother side. If that other side is not \"spiritual,\" in the sense in\r\nwhich the word is largely used in the West, it is at least regardful\r\nof other considerations than the \"practical.\" It is with thoughts of\r\nthat vital side of the national character that I recall a story told\r\nme by Dr. Nitobe of the last days of the Forty-seven Ronin. It is well\r\nauthenticated. When the Ronin had slain their dead lord's persecutor\r\nand had given themselves up to the authorities, they were found worthy\r\nof death. But the Shogun was in some anxiety as to what might justly\r\nbe done. He sent privily to a famous abbot saying that it was at all\r\ntimes the duty of the Shogun to condemn to death men who had committed\r\nmurder. Yet it was the privilege of a priest to ask for mercy, and in\r\nthe matter of the lives of the Ronin the Shogun would not be unwilling\r\nto listen to a plea for mercy. The abbot answered that he sympathised\r\ndeeply with the Ronin, but because he so sympathised with them he was\r\nunwilling to take any steps which might hinder the carrying out of the\r\nsentence. It was true, he said, that there were old men among the\r\nRonin, but many, of them were young men--one was only fifteen--and it\r\nhad to be borne in mind that if they escaped death at the hands of the\r\nlaw it was hardly likely that during the whole course of their\r\nafter-lives they could hope to escape committing sin of some sort or\r\nanother. At the moment they had reached a pinnacle of nobility which\r\nthey could never pass and it was a thing to be desired for them that\r\nthey should die now, when they would live to all posterity as heroes.\r\nThe happiest fate for the Ronin was a righteous death, and as their\r\nadmiring sympathiser the abbot expressed his unwillingness to do\r\nanything which might have the effect of saving them from so glorious\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] Someone said to me, \"I have in mind one village where there is a\r\npoorly cared-for school and a score of teahouses giving employment to\r\nnearly two hundred people.\"\r\n\r\n[222] \"Small boards with crude designs painted on them. They may be\r\nprayers, thank-offerings or protective charms. A shrine where many\r\nthanks _ema_ have been left is clearly that of a god ready to hear and\r\nanswer prayer. Worshippers flock to the place and the accumulation of\r\npainted boards--whether prayers or thanks--increases.\"--FREDERICK\r\nSTARR, _Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan_, vol. xlviii.\r\n\r\n[223] The percentage in conscripts in 1918 was 2.2 per cent, against\r\n2.5 per cent, in 1917 and 2.7 per cent, in 1916. (\"Not less than 10\r\nper cent. of the population of our large towns are infected with\r\nsyphilis and a much larger proportion with gonorrhœa.\"--SIR JAMES\r\nCRICHTON-BROWNE.) The figures for the general population of Japan must\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\n[224] See Appendix LXIII.\r\n\r\n[225] It sometimes happens that an adopted son is dismissed with \"a\r\nsufficient monetary compensation\" when a real son is born.\r\n\r\n[226] I met a fine ex-daimyo, who after the Restoration had served as\r\na prefectural governor. He was so generous in giving money to public\r\nobjects in his prefecture that his family compelled him to resign\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[227] See Appendix XXX.\r\n\r\n[228] It is only within the last quarter of a century that the\r\nauthorities have taken a stand against infanticide. There is no\r\ntraditional dislike of an artificial diminution of progeny, for many\r\nof the fathers and grandfathers of the present generation practised\r\nit. Methods of procuring abortion were also common. A certain plant\r\nhas a well-known reputation as an abortifacient. A young peer and his\r\nwife are now conducting a campaign on behalf of smaller families, and\r\nthe discussion has advanced far enough for a magazine to invite Dr.\r\nHavelock Ellis to express his views.\r\n\r\n[229] According to the 1918 figures the ages at which men and women\r\nmarried were as follows per 1,000: before 20, m. 37.6, w. 259.0;\r\n20-25, m. 304.9, w. 434.8; 26-30, m. 347.9, w. 159.4; 31-35, m. 145.1,\r\nw. 67.3; 36-40, m. 70.0, w. 37.1; 41-45, m. 41.8, w. 21.4; 46-50, m.\r\n22.8, w. 10.5; 51-55, m. 14.7, w. 6.0; 56-60, m. 7.3, w. 2.5; 61 and\r\nupwards, m. 7.9, w. 2.\r\n\r\n[230] See Appendix XXX.\r\n\r\n[231] See Appendices XXV and LXXX; also page 363 for the reasons\r\noperating against emigration. Mr. J. Russell Kennedy, of\r\nKokusai-Reuter, declared (1921) that it was \"a myth that Japan must\r\nfind an outlet for surplus population; Japan has plenty of room within\r\nher own border,\" that is, including Korea and Formosa as well as\r\nHokkaido in Japan. Mr. S. Yoshida, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy\r\nin London, in an address also delivered in 1921, stressed the value of\r\nthe fishing-grounds and the mercantile marine as openings for an\r\nincreased population. \"The resources of the sea,\" he said, \"give Japan\r\nmore room for her population than appears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS IN HOKKAIDO\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL JAPAN AND ITS UN-JAPANESE WAYS\r\n\r\nAbove all, this is not concerned with poetry.--WILFRED OWEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller stands at the northern end of the mainland[232] of\r\nJapan he is five hundred miles from Tokyo. In the north of Hokkaido he\r\nis a thousand miles away. Hokkaido, the most northerly and the second\r\nbiggest of the four islands into which Japan is divided, is curiously\r\nAmerican. The wide straight streets of the capital, Sapporo,[233] laid\r\nout at right angles, the rough buggies with the farmer and his wife\r\nriding together, the wooden houses with stove stacks, and, instead of\r\npaper-covered _shoji_, window panes: these things are seen nowhere\r\nelse in Japan and came straight from America. It was certainly from\r\nAmerica that the farmers had their cries of \"Whoa.\" One of the best\r\nauthorities on Hokkaido has declared that the administrative and\r\nagricultural instructors whom America sent there from about the time\r\nof the Franco-Prussian war \"gave Japan a fairer, kindlier conception\r\nof America than all her study of American history.\"\r\n\r\nIn Old Japan there is always something which speaks of the centuries\r\nthat are gone; in Sapporo there is nothing that matters which is fifty\r\nyears old. One of the most remarkable facts in the agricultural\r\nhistory of Japan is that a country with a teeming population and an\r\nintensive farming should have left entirely undeveloped to so late a\r\nperiod as the early seventies a great island of 35,000 square miles\r\nwhich lies within sight of its shores. The wonder is that an attempt\r\non Yezo[234] was not made by the Russians, who, but for the vigorous\r\naction of a British naval commander, would undoubtedly have taken\r\npossession of the island of Tsushima, 700 miles farther south and\r\nmidway between Japan and Korea. Up to the time of the fall of the\r\nShogun the revenue of the lords of Yezo was got by taxing the harvest\r\nof the sea and the precarious gains of hunters. The Imperial Rescript\r\ncarried by the army which was sent against certain adherents of the\r\nShogun who had fled there said: \"We intend to take steps to reclaim\r\nand people the island.\"[235] It is doubtful if at that period the\r\npopulation was more than 60,000[236] (including Ainu).[237]\r\n\r\nWhen Count Kuroda was put at the head of the Colonial Government he\r\nwent over to America and secured as his adviser-in-chief the chief of\r\nthe Agricultural Department at Washington. Stock, seeds, fruit trees,\r\nimplements and machinery, railway engines, buildings, practically\r\neverything was American in the early days of Hokkaido. During a\r\nten-year period, in which forty-five American instructors were sent\r\nfor, five Russians, four Britons, four Germans, three Dutchmen and a\r\nFrenchman were also imported.[238]\r\n\r\nGovernor Kuroda had a million yen placed at his disposal for ten years\r\nin succession, and a million yen was a big sum in those days. Before\r\nlong there were flour mills, breweries, beet-sugar factories, canning\r\nplants, lead and coal mining and silk manufacturing and an experiment\r\nin soldier colonisation which owed something to Russian experiments in\r\nCossack farming. An agricultural school grew into a large agricultural\r\ncollege; and this agricultural college has lately become the\r\nUniversity of Hokkaido, with nearly a thousand students.[239] How much\r\nof a pioneer Sapporo College was may be gathered from the fact that\r\nwhen I was in Hokkaido 67 out of the 140 men who were members of the\r\nfaculty had been themselves taught there. Dean Sato (Japan's first\r\nexchange lecturer to American universities), Dr. Nitobe (Japanese\r\nSecretary of the League of Nations) and Kanzō Uchimura were among the\r\nfirst students. There have always been American professors at\r\nSapporo--its first president came from Massachusetts--and the\r\nprofessorship of English has always been held by an American.\r\n\r\nThe 50 acres of elm-studded land in which the University buildings\r\nstand are a surprise, for the elm grows nowhere else in Japan but\r\nHokkaido.[240] The extent of the University's landed possessions is\r\nalso unexpected. There are two training farms of 185 and 260 acres\r\nrespectively, beautifully kept botanic gardens, a tract of 15,000\r\nacres on which there are already more than a thousand tenants, and\r\n300,000 acres of forests in Hokkaido, Saghalien and Korea. Four or\r\nfive times as many students as can be admitted offer themselves at\r\nSapporo.\r\n\r\nThere is in Hokkaido an agricultural and rural life conceived for a\r\ncountry where stock may be kept and a farmer does not need to practise\r\nthe superintensive farming of Old Japan. At the first University farm\r\nI looked over it was clear that not only American but Swedish, German\r\nand Swiss farming practice had had its influence. No longer was the\r\nfarmer content with mattocks, hoes and flails. A silo dominated the\r\nscene, and maize, eaten from the cob in Old Japan, was a crop for\r\nstock.[241] I also noticed crops of oats and rye.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Hokkaido in the last week of August in a linen suit and\r\nwas glad to put on a woollen one. By September 29 it was snowing.\r\nSnow-shoes were shown among the products of the island at the\r\nprefectural exhibition. Canadians have likened the climate of Hokkaido\r\nto that of Manitoba. Hokkaido is on the line of the Great Lakes, but\r\nthe cold current from the North makes comparisons of this sort\r\nineffective. It is only in southern Hokkaido that apples will grow.\r\nThirty years ago wolves and bear were shot two miles from Sapporo and\r\nbear may still be found within ten miles.\r\n\r\nThe sea fisheries of Hokkaido are valuable but agriculture and\r\nforestry are greater money makers. Even without forestry agriculture\r\nis well ahead of factory industry, which is also eclipsed by mining.\r\nIndustry is aided by the presence of coal. Among manufactures, brewing\r\nstands out even more conspicuously than wood-pulp making or canning.\r\nOne of the three best-known beers in Japan comes from Hokkaido.[242]\r\nIn contrast with the situation in Old Japan, where the land is half\r\npaddy and half upland, there is in Hokkaido only a ninth of the\r\ncultivated land under rice.[243] When I was in Hokkaido there were\r\n600,000 _chō_ under cultivation, a hundred and fifty times more than\r\nthere were in 1873. The line marking the northern or rather the\r\nnorth-eastern limit of rice shows roughly a third of the island on the\r\nnorthern and eastern coasts to be at present beyond the skill of rice\r\ngrowers. There is always uncertainty with the rice crop in Hokkaido.\r\nAs the growing period is short, half the rice is not transplanted but\r\nsown direct in the paddies. A bad crop is expected once in seven\r\nyears. In such a season there is no yield and even the straw is not\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nImmigrants get 5 _chō_, but if they are without capital they first go\r\nto work as tenants. There are contractors in the towns who supply\r\nlabourers to farmers and factories at busy times. When newcomers have\r\ncapital and are keen on rice growing and are families working without\r\nhired labour, they are strongly recommended not to devote more than\r\n2-1\\2 _chō_ to rice--from 3 to 5 _chō_ are the absolute limit--against\r\n1-1\\2 or 2 _chō_ to other crops. When the holder of a 5-_chō_ holding\r\nprospers he buys a second farm and more horses and implements, and\r\nhires labour for the busy period. But 10 or 15 _chō_ is considered as\r\nmuch as can be worked in this way. If the area is more than 10 or 15\r\n_chō_ it is difficult to get labour in the busy season, for it is the\r\nbusy season for everybody. Labourers from a distance can be got only\r\nat an unprofitable rate. It is first the lack of capital and then the\r\nlack of labour which prevents the farmer extending his holding.[244]\r\nThe limit of practical mixed farming is 30 _chō_. (Stock farming is\r\nfor milk rather than for meat, and more than one condensed-milk\r\nfactory is in operation.) Even in Hokkaido large farming, as it is\r\nunderstood in Great Britain and America, is not easy to find.[245]\r\n\r\nOn my journey north from Sapporo the first thing which brought home to\r\nme the colonial character of the agriculture was the tree stumps\r\nsticking up in the paddies. The second was the extent to which the\r\nrivers were still uncontrolled. The longest river in Japan, 260 miles\r\nlong, is in Hokkaido. There was obviously a vast moorland area in need\r\nof draining. Peat--there are 300,000 _chō_ of it--may be a standby\r\nwhen the waste of timber that is going on brings about a shortage of\r\nfuel other than coal. From poor peat soil, which was growing oats,\r\nbuckwheat and millet, we passed to land capable of producing rice, and\r\nsaw ploughing with horses. One region had been opened for only twenty\r\nyears, but already the farmers had cultivated the hillsides in the\r\nassiduous fashion of Old Japan.\r\n\r\nFrom Ashigawa we made some excursions in a prim _basha_ to places\r\nwhich were always several miles farther on than they were supposed to\r\nbe and were usually reached by tracks covered with stones from 6 to 9\r\nins. long and having ruts a foot deep.\r\n\r\nWe visited a large estate with 350 tenants who were mostly working\r\n2-1/2 _chō_, though some had twice as much. Nearly all of these\r\ntenants appeared to have one or two horses, although the estate\r\nmanager had advised them to use oxen or cows as more economical\r\ndraught animals. When I remembered the distance the farmers were from\r\nthe town and the state of the roads, and noticed the satisfaction\r\nwhich the men we passed displayed in being able to ride, it was easy\r\nto believe that the possession of a horse might have its value as a\r\nmeans of social progress. During the last ten years half the tenants\r\nhad made enough to enable them to buy farms. The tenants on this\r\nestate had two temples and one shrine.[246]\r\n\r\nI visited a fifteen-years-old co-operative alcohol factory with a\r\ncapital of 300,000 yen. Of its materials 80 per cent. seemed to be\r\npotato starch waste and 20 per cent. maize. The product was 6,000 or\r\n7,000 _koku_ of alcohol. The dividend was 8 per cent. On the waste a\r\nlarge number of pigs was fed. The animals were kept in pens with\r\nboarded floors within a small area, and I was not surprised to learn\r\nthat three or four died every month. Starch making, which produces the\r\nwaste used by the alcohol factory, is managed on quite a small scale.\r\nAn outfit may cost no more than 30 or 50 yen. I went over a small\r\npeppermint-making plant. Most of the peppermint raised in Japan--it\r\nreaches a value of 2 million yen--is grown in Hokkaido.\r\n\r\nOne day in the eastern part of the island I met in a small hotel,\r\nwhich was run by a man and his wife who had been in America, several\r\nold farmers who had obviously made money. They declared that formerly\r\nonly 20 per cent. of the colonists succeeded, but now the proportion\r\nwas more than 65 per cent. I imagine that they meant by success that\r\nthe colonists did really well, for it was added that it was rare in\r\nthat district for people to return to Old Japan. One of the company\r\nsaid that not more than 5 per cent. returned. \"Land is too expensive\r\nat home,\" he continued; \"when a Japanese comes here and gets some, he\r\nworks hard.\" A good man, they said, should make, after four or five\r\nyears, 70 to 100 yen clear profit in a year.\r\n\r\nI rather suspect that the men I talked with had made some of their\r\nmoney by advancing funds to their neighbours on mortgage. They all\r\nseemed to own several farms. When I asked how religion prospered in\r\nHokkaido they said with a smile, \"There are many things to do here, so\r\nthere is no spare time for religion as in our native places.\" There is\r\na larger proportion of Christians in Hokkaido than on the mainland.\r\nOne village of a thousand inhabitants contained two churches and a\r\nSalvation Army barracks. It was reputed, also, to have eight or ten\r\n\"waitresses\" and five saké shops. It is said that a good deal of\r\n_shochu_, which is stronger than saké, is drunk.\r\n\r\nThe roughest _basha_ ride I made was to a place seven miles from\r\nrailhead in the extreme north-east. Such roads as we adventured by are\r\nlittle more than tracks with ditches on either side. The journey back,\r\nbecause there were no horses to ride, we made in a narrow but\r\nextraordinarily heavy farm wagon with wheels a foot wide and drawn by\r\na stallion. Shortly after starting there was a terrific thunderstorm\r\nwhich soaked us and hastened uncomfortably the pace of the animal in\r\nthe shafts. When the worst of the downpour was over, and we had faced\r\nthe prospect of slithering about the wagon for the rest of the\r\njourney, for the stallion had decided to hurry, a farmer's wife asked\r\nus for a lift and clambered in with agility. My companion and I were\r\nthen sitting in a soggy state with our backs against the wagon front\r\nand our legs outstretched resignedly. The cheery farmer's wife, who\r\nwas wet too, plopped down between us and, as the bumps came, gripped\r\none of my legs with much good fellowship. She was a godsend by reason\r\nof her plumpness, for we were now wedged so tight that we no longer\r\nrocked and pitched about the wagon at each jolt. And no doubt we dried\r\nmore quickly. Providence had indeed been good to us, for shortly\r\nafterwards we passed, lying on its side in a _spruit_, the _basha_\r\nthat had carried us on our outward journey.\r\n\r\nWe were three hours in all in the wagon. Our passenger told us that\r\nher husband had several farms and that they were very comfortably off\r\nand very glad that they had come to Hokkaido. When the farmer's wife\r\nhad to alight a mile from our destination we chose to walk. Bad roads\r\nare a serious problem for the Hokkaido farmer. In one district, only\r\nfifteen miles from the capital, they are so bad that rice is at half\r\nthe price it makes in Sapporo. It is unfortunate that the roads are at\r\ntheir worst in autumn and spring when the farmer wants to transport\r\nhis produce.\r\n\r\nI visited the 700-acre settlement which Mr. Tomeoka has opened in\r\nconnection with his Tokyo institution for the reclamation of young\r\nwastrels. His formula is, \"Feed them well, work them hard and give\r\nthem enough sleep.\" Among the volumes on his shelves there were three\r\nbooks about Tolstoy and another three, one English, one American and\r\none German, all bearing the same title, _The Social Question_.\r\nNeedless to say that _Self-Help_ had its place.\r\n\r\nI liked Mr. Tomeoka's idea of an open-air chapel on a tree-shaded\r\nheight from which there was a fine view. It reminded me of the view\r\nfrom an open space on rising ground near the famous Danish rural high\r\nschool of Askov, from which, on Sundays, parties of excursionists used\r\nto look down enviously on Slesvig and irritate the Germans by singing\r\nDanish national songs. Mr. Tomeoka believed in better houses and\r\nbetter food for farmers and in money raised by means of the _kō_--\"the\r\nrules and regulations of co-operative societies are too complicated\r\nfor farmers to understand.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the huts of some settlers who had weathered their first Hokkaido\r\nwinter. Buckwheat, scratched in in open spaces among the trees, was\r\nthe chief crop. The huts consisted of one room. Most of the floor was\r\nraised above the ground and covered with rough straw matting. In the\r\ncentre of the platform was the usual fire-hole. The walls were matting\r\nand brushwood. I was assured that \"the snow and good fires, for which\r\nthere is unlimited fuel, keep the huts warm.\"\r\n\r\nThe railway winds through high hills and makes sharp curves and steep\r\nascents and descents. There are tracts of rolling country under rough\r\ngrass. Sometimes these areas have been cleared by forest fires\r\nstarted by lightning. Wide spaces are a great change from the scenery\r\nof closely farmed Japan. The thing that makes the hillsides different\r\nfrom our wilder English and Scottish hillsides is that there are\r\nneither sheep nor cattle on them.\r\n\r\nWhen the culpable destruction of timber in Hokkaido is added to what\r\nhas been lost by forest fires, due to lightning or to accident--one\r\nconflagration was more than 200 acres in extent--it is easy to realise\r\nthat the rivers are bringing far more water and detritus from the\r\nhills than they ought to do and are preparing flood problems with\r\nwhich it will cost millions to cope when the country gets more closely\r\nsettled. It is deplorable that, apart from needless burning on the\r\nhillsides, the farmers have not been dissuaded from completely\r\nclearing their arable land of trees. On many holdings there is not\r\neven a clump left to shelter the farmhouse and buildings. In not a few\r\ndistricts the colonists have created treeless plains. In place after\r\nplace the once beautiful countryside is now ugly and depressing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[232] The word used by people in Hokkaido for the main island, Hondo\r\nor Honshu (_Hon_, main; _do_ or _shu_, land), is _Naichi_ (interior).\r\n\r\n[233] From Aomori on the mainland to Hakodate in Hokkaido is a\r\n50-miles sea trip. Then comes a long night journey to Sapporo, during\r\nwhich one passes between two active volcanoes. The sea trip is 50\r\nmiles because a large part of the route taken by the steamer is\r\nthrough Aomori Bay. The nearest part of Hokkaido to the mainland is a\r\nlittle less than the distance between Dover and Calais.\r\n\r\n[234] Foreigners sometimes confound Yezo (Hokkaido) with Yedo, the old\r\nname for Tokyo.\r\n\r\n[235] A sixth of Hokkaido still belongs to the Imperial Household. In\r\n1918 it decided to sell forest and other land (parts of Japan not\r\nstated) to the value of 100 million yen. In 1917 the Imperial estates\r\nwere estimated at 18-3/4 million chō of forest and 22-1/4 million chō\r\nof \"plains,\" that is tracts which are not timbered nor cultivated nor\r\nbuilt on.\r\n\r\n[236] In 1919 it was 2,137,700.\r\n\r\n[237] Considerations of space compel the holding over of a chapter on\r\nthe Ainu for another volume.\r\n\r\n[238] Of the 96 foreign instructors in institutions \"under the direct\r\ncontrol\" of the Tokyo Department of Education in 1917-18, there were\r\n27 British, 22 German, 19 American and 12 French.\r\n\r\n[239] Hokkaido is one of five Imperial universities. There are in\r\naddition several well-known private universities.\r\n\r\n[240] Grouse are also to be found in Hokkaido, but no pheasants and no\r\nmonkeys. The deep Tsugaru Strait marks an ancient geological division\r\nbetween Hokkaido and the mainland.\r\n\r\n[241] It is sometimes eaten, ground to a rough meal, with rice. The\r\nargument is that maize is two thirds the price of rice and more easily\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\n[242] See Appendix XXXVII.\r\n\r\n[243] The latest figures for Hokkaido show only a tenth.\r\n\r\n[244] For farmers' incomes, see Appendix XIII.\r\n\r\n[245] For sizes of farms, see Appendix LXIV.\r\n\r\n[246] For a tenant's contract, see Appendix LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nSHALL THE JAPANESE EAT BREAD AND MEAT?\r\n\r\n_Bon yori shoko_ (Proof, not argument)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in Tokyo I heard a Japanese who was looking at a photograph of\r\na British woman War-worker feeding pigs ask if the animals were sheep.\r\nSheep are so rare in Japan that an old ram has been exhibited at a\r\ncountry fair as a lion. In contrast with Western agriculture based on\r\nlive stock we have in Japan an agriculture based on rice.[247] But a\r\nsection of the Japanese agricultural world turns its eyes longingly to\r\nmixed farming, and so, when I returned to Sapporo from my trip to the\r\nnorth of Hokkaido, I was taken to see a Government stock farm--with a\r\nsmoking volcano in the background. Hokkaido has four other official\r\nfarms, one belonging to the Government and one for raising horses for\r\nthe army. I was shown, in addition to horses, Ayrshire, Holstein and\r\nBrown Swiss cattle, Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs and Southdown and\r\nShropshire sheep in good buildings. I noticed two self-binders and a\r\nhay loader and I beheld for the first time in Japan a dairymaid and\r\ncollies--one was of a useless show type.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the knack of looking after animals and a liking\r\nfor them can be developed is an interesting question. Experts in\r\nstock-keeping with generations of experience behind them will agree\r\nthat it is on the answer to this question that the success or\r\nnon-success of the Japanese in animal industry in no small measure\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nI have a note of a discussion on the general treatment of domestic\r\nanimals in Japan in the course of which it was admitted that they were\r\n\"certainly not treated as well as in most parts of Europe, or as in\r\nChina.\" One reason given was that \"most sects believe in the\r\nreincarnation of the wicked in the form of animals.\" The freedom which\r\ndogs enjoyed in English houses seemed strange; my friends no doubt\r\nforgot that Western houses have no _tatami_ to be preserved. It was\r\ncontended, however, that cavalry soldiers \"often weep on parting from\r\ntheir horses\" and that \"people with knowledge of animals are fond of\r\nthem.\" I have myself seen farmers' wives in tears at a horse fair when\r\nthe foals they had reared were to be sold and the animals in their\r\ntimidity nuzzled them. Westerners who are familiar with the exquisite\r\nand humoursome studies of animal, bird and insect life by Japanese\r\nartists of the past and present day,[248] are in no doubt that such\r\nwork was prompted by real knowledge and love of the \"lower creation.\"\r\nThe Japanese have a keen appreciation of the \"song\" of an amazing\r\nvariety of \"musical\" insects--there are 20,000 kinds of insects. It is\r\nan appreciation not vouchsafed to the foreigner whose nerves are\r\nracked by the insistent bizz of the _semi_ or cicada--there are 38\r\nkinds of cicada. Everyone will recall Hearn's chapter on the trade in\r\n\"singing insects.\"\r\n\r\nOne of my hosts in Aichi had two tiny cages which each contained one\r\nof these creatures. The cages were hung from the eaves. In the evening\r\nwhen the stone lantern in the garden was lit, and it was desired to\r\ngive an illusion of greater coolness after a hot day a servant was\r\nsent up to the roof to pour down a tubful of water in order to produce\r\nthe dripping sound of rain; and this at once set the caged insects\r\nchirping.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive foreigner is distressed by the way in which newly born\r\npuppies and kittens are thrown out to die because their Buddhist\r\nowners are too scrupulous to kill them. The stranger's feelings are\r\nalso worked on by the unhappy demeanour and uncared-for look of dogs\r\nand cats. On chancing to enter in a Japanese city an English home\r\nwhere there were three dogs I could not but mark how they contrasted\r\nin bearing and appearance with the generality of the animals I had\r\nseen. Yet these dogs were all mongrel foundlings which had been\r\nabandoned near my friend's house or dropped into her garden. No doubt\r\nmost Japanese dogs suffer from having too much rice--and polished at\r\nthat--and practically no bones. An excuse for the neglect of cats is\r\nthat they scratch woodwork and _tatami_ and insist on carrying their\r\nfood into the best room.\r\n\r\nHorses are often overloaded and mercilessly driven on hilly\r\nroads.[249] On the other hand, carters lead their horses. It might be\r\nadded that the coolies who haul and push handcarts bearing enormous\r\nloads never spare themselves. I was told more than once of people who\r\nhad been too tenderhearted to make an end of old horses. I also heard\r\nof hens which had been allowed to live on until they died of old age.\r\nIn some mountain communities it is the custom, when a chicken must be\r\nkilled for a visitor's meal, for an exchange of birds to be made with\r\na neighbour in order that the killing may not be too painful for the\r\nowner.[250]\r\n\r\nExcept in hotels and stores in Tokyo and the cities which cater for\r\nforeigners, one seldom sees such an animal product as cheese. On the\r\nGovernment farm I found excellent cheese and butter being made.\r\nUntravelled Japanese have the dislike of the smell of cheese that\r\nWestern people have of the stench of boiling _daikon_. Nor is cheese\r\nthe only alien food with which the ordinary Japanese has a difficulty.\r\nThe smell of mutton is repugnant to him and he has yet to acquire a\r\ntaste for milk. The demand for milk is increasing, however. The guide\r\nbooks are quite out of date. Nearly all the milk ordinarily sold for\r\nforeigners and invalids is supplied sterilised in bottles. On the\r\nplatforms of the larger railway stations bottles of milk are vended\r\nfrom a copper container holding hot water. In places where I have been\r\nable to obtain bread I have usually had no difficulty in getting milk.\r\n(The word for bread, _pan_, has been in the language since the coming\r\nof the Portuguese, and all over Japan one finds sponge cake,\r\n_kasutera_, a word from the Spanish.) Butter in country hotels is\r\nusually rancid, for the reason, I imagine, that it is carelessly\r\nhandled and kept too long and that few Japanese know the taste of good\r\nbutter. The development of a liking for bread and butter is obviously\r\none of the conditions of the establishment of a successful animal\r\nindustry. Condensed milk is sold in large quantities, but chiefly to\r\nsupplement infants' supplies and to make sweetstuff. The 1919\r\nproduction was estimated at 57 million tins.\r\n\r\nOne argument for an animal industry is that with an increasing\r\npopulation the fish supply will not go so far as it has done. It is\r\nsaid that fish are not to be found in as large quantities as formerly.\r\nAnother argument is that the national imports include many products of\r\nanimal industry which might be advantageously produced at home. Not\r\nonly is more milk, condensed and fresh, being consumed: with the\r\nadoption of foreign clothes in professional and business life and in\r\nthe army and navy, more and more wool is being worn[251] and more and\r\nmore leather is needed for the boots which are being substituted for\r\n_geta_ and also for service requirements. It is contended that for the\r\nemancipation of Japanese agriculture from the _petite culture_ stage\r\nit is essential that a larger number of draught oxen and horses shall\r\nbe used. It is equally important, it is suggested, that more manure\r\nshall be made on the farms, so that a limit shall be placed on the\r\noutlay on imported fertilisers. Finally there are those who urge that\r\nthe Japanese should be better fed and that better feeding can only be\r\nbrought about by an increased consumption of animal products.[252]\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of outdoor stock keeping in Hokkaido are limited by\r\nthe fact that snow lies from November to the middle of February and in\r\nthe north of the island to the end of March. A high agricultural\r\nauthority did not think that the number of cattle in all Japan could\r\nbe raised to more than two million within twenty years.[253]\r\n\r\nIn the management of sheep--there were about 5,000 in the whole\r\ncountry when I was in Hokkaido--there has been failure after failure,\r\nbut it is held that the prospects for sheep in Hokkaido are promising.\r\n(The question is discussed in the next Chapter.) At present, owing to\r\nthe lack of a market for mutton, pigs, which used to be kept in the\r\ndays before Buddhism exerted its influence, seem more attractive to\r\nexperimenting farmers than sheep. No one has proposed that sheep\r\nshould be kept in ones and twos for milking as in Holland.[254] When\r\nmilk is needed it is said that goats, of which there are more than\r\n90,000 in Japan, are desirable stock, but I doubt whether more than\r\n500 of these goats are milked.[255] They are kept to produce meat.\r\nSome people hope that those who eat goat's flesh will come to realise\r\nthe superiority of mutton.\r\n\r\nThe case for pigs is that sweet potatoes and squash can be fed to\r\nthem, that they produce frequent litters, that pork is more and more\r\nappreciated, and that there are 300,000 of them in the country\r\nalready. Some confident experts who have possibly been influenced by\r\nthe large consumption of pork in China argue that pork may become\r\nequally popular in Japan. There are two bacon factories not far from\r\nTokyo.\r\n\r\nAs in other countries, the argument for doing away with foreign\r\nimports is pushed in Japan to ridiculous lengths. Japan, which aims\r\nabove all at being an exporting country, cannot attain her desire\r\nwithout receiving imports to pay for her exports.[256] The\r\nphysiological argument for an animal industry is unconvincing. The\r\nJapanese have a long dietetic history as vegetarians who eat a little\r\nfish and a few eggs. There exists in Japan an exceptionally ingenious\r\nvariety of nitrogenous foods derived from the vegetable kingdom, and\r\nthe Japanese have become accustomed to digest vegetable protein.[257]\r\nIt might be suggested, with some show of reason, that in this matter\r\nof the adoption of a meat dietary the Japanese are once more under the\r\ninfluence of foreign ideas which are a little out of date.[258] In\r\nEurope and America there is evidence of a decreasing meat consumption\r\namong educated people, and medical papers are full of counsels to\r\ndiminish the amount of meat consumed. There is also in the West an\r\nincreasing sensitiveness to the horrors inflicted on animals in\r\ntransportation by rail and steamer, and if an animal industry were\r\nestablished in Japan there would certainly be a great deal of\r\ntransportation by rail and steamer from the breeding to the rearing\r\ndistricts, and from these districts to the slaughtering centres. If\r\nthe present advocacy of an animal industry for Japan should triumph\r\nover the reluctance to take animal life inculcated by Buddhism it is\r\nhardly likely to be regarded in the West as a forward step in the\r\nethical evolution of the Japanese.[259]\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to meet in Sapporo a man who has made a\r\nspecial study of the food of the Japanese people, Professor Morimoto\r\nof the University. He said that he had no doubt that when the Japanese\r\nbegan to eat bread instead of rice they would develop a taste for meat\r\nas well as butter. With great kindness he placed at my disposal\r\nstatistics which he afterwards expanded in a thesis for Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity. He had investigated the dietary of the families of 200\r\ntenants of the University farms. Reduced to terms of men per day the\r\nresult was:\r\n\r\n                            Sen.                 Sen.\r\nRice (1.95 _go_)            4.2     Vegetables   2.2\r\n(Naked) barley (3.45 _go_)  3.3     Pickles[260]  .6\r\nFish                        1.0     Saké          .08\r\n_Miso_                       .7     Sugar         .02\r\n_Shoyu_ (soy)                .03               ------\r\n                                                12.13\r\n\r\nOr at Tokyo prices, 14.3 sen. On averaging, in terms of per man per\r\nday, the food and drink consumption of all Japan, Professor Morimoto\r\nfound the result to be:\r\n\r\n                        Sen.                        Sen.\r\nGrain                   6.60          Fruits         .40\r\nLegumes                  .39          Sugar          .53\r\nVegetables              2.00          Salt           .20\r\nFish and seaweeds        .54          Tea            .10\r\nBeef and veal            .10 }        Alcoholic\r\nOther animal food        .03 }          liquor      1.50\r\nChicken                  .03 } .33    Tobacco        .45\r\nEggs                     .13 }\r\nMilk                     .04 }\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                   13.04[261]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Professor compares with these totals the 34.4 sen and 39.3 sen per\r\nday which seem to represent the cost of the food of the rank and file\r\nin the navy and army, and three standards of diet issued by the\r\nofficial Bureau of Hygiene providing for expenditures of 32.1 sen, 33\r\nsen and 44.4 sen respectively. (All the prices I have cited are dated\r\n1915.) Beef and pork as well as fish are used in the army and navy.\r\nThe navy also uses bread.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morimoto estimates that a Japanese may be fairly expected to\r\nconsume only 80 per cent. of what a foreigner needs, for the average\r\nweight of Japanese is only 13 _kwan_ 830 _momme_ to the European's 17\r\n_kwan_ 20 _momme_.\r\n\r\nMy personal impression, which I give merely for what it is worth, for\r\nI have made no investigation of the subject, is that, though Japanese\r\nmay thrive on meagre fare, they eat large quantities of food when\r\ntheir resources permit of indulgence. The common ailment seems to be\r\n\"stomach ache.\" This may be due to eating at irregular hours, to an\r\nunbalanced dietary, to the eating of undercooked viands or to\r\noccasional over-eating, or to all of these causes.[262] Undoubtedly\r\nthere is much room for dietetic reform.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morimoto had come to the conclusion \"that there is\r\nunder-feeding, largely due to a bad choice of foods, that the relation\r\nof the nutritive value of foods to their cost is insufficiently\r\nstudied and that cooking can be improved.\" It is of course an old\r\ncriticism of the Japanese table that food is either imperfectly cooked\r\nor prepared too much with a view to appearance. The Professor's\r\nfinding was that the Japanese need the addition of meat and bread to\r\ntheir dietary. As far as meat is concerned he did not convince me. Let\r\nme quote him on the soy bean: \"It is a remarkably good substitute for\r\nmeat. It is very low in price but its nutritive value is very high.\r\nThe essential element of _miso_, _tofu_ and _shoyu_ is soy bean.\"\r\nBread is another matter. The Japanese Navy, presumably because it may\r\nfind itself far from Japan, has accustomed its sailors to eat bread,\r\nand a case can certainly be made out for the general population not\r\nrelying on rice as a grain food. But, as the large quantities of\r\nbarley eaten show, there is no such reliance now. Morimoto urged that\r\nwhile there might be no difference in the nutritive value of wheat and\r\nrice, rice as usually eaten induced \"abnormal distension of the\r\nstomach and poor nutrition.\" Again, wheat was a world crop,[263]\r\nwhereas rice, owing to the Japanese objection to foreign rice, was a\r\nlocal crop. If the Japanese were users of wheat as well as of rice\r\nthey would not have to pay so much for food, when, on the failure of\r\nthe rice crop in considerable parts of Japan, the price of rice was\r\nhigh. \"The consumption is about 10 million bushels more than the\r\nproduction.\" Further, rice was more costly in cultivation than wheat,\r\nand its production could not be increased so as to keep pace with the\r\nincrease in population. The yield, which was 46 million _koku_ in\r\n1904, was only 50 millions in 1912; and 65 millions in 1927 seemed an\r\nexcessive estimate. In 1912 the importation of rice was 2 million\r\n_koku_. But on all these points the reader should take note of the\r\ndata on page 84 and in Appendices XXIV and XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Professor's concluding point against rice was that it was\r\nexpensive to prepare. The washing of the rice in a succession of\r\nwaters and the cleaning of the sticky pot in which it was cooked and\r\nof the equally sticky tub in which it was served took a great deal of\r\ntime. Then in order to cook rice properly--and the Japanese have\r\nbecome connoisseurs--the exact proportion of water must be gauged. The\r\nsupplies of rice to be cooked were so considerable that the name of\r\nthe servant lass was \"girl to boil the rice.\" But when bread was used\r\ninstead of rice, said the Professor jubilantly, a baking twice a week\r\nwould do. Why, an hour a day might be saved, which in twenty years\r\nwould be 73,000 hours, or a whole year, and, reckoning women's labour\r\nas worth 5 sen an hour, that would be a saving of 565 yen!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[247] For statistics of cultivated area and live stock, see Appendix\r\nLXVI.\r\n\r\n[248] One thinks of Takeuchi Seiho who lives in Kyoto, of\r\nToba Sojo (11th century) for monkeys, frogs and bullocks, and in the\r\nTokugawa period of Okio for dogs and carp, of Jakchū for fowls and\r\nbirds, of Hasegawa Tohaku and Sosen for monkeys, of Kawanabe Kyosai\r\nfor crows, and of Kesai and Hokusai for birds, fish and insects.\r\n\r\n[249] Nevertheless it is well not to be hasty in judgment. On the day\r\non which this footnote was written, April 7, 1921, I find the\r\nfollowing items in the _Daily Mail_. On page 4 the Attorney-General\r\nregrets that the law tolerates the \"cruel practice\" by which 30\r\npigeons were killed or injured at a certain pigeon-shooting\r\ncompetition and expresses inability to bring in legislation. On page\r\n5, col. 2, an M.P. is reported as mentioning a case in which a puppy\r\nhad been kicked to death and as asking the Home Secretary whether the\r\nlaw imposing imprisonment for a short term could not be strengthened.\r\nOn the same page, col. 5, a railway porter is reported as having been\r\nfined for flinging three small calves into a farm cart by the tails.\r\n\r\n[250] For poultry statistics, see Appendix LXVII.\r\n\r\n[251] Before the extensive use of _yofuku_ (foreign clothes) the dress\r\nof Japanese men and women was entirely of cotton and silk or of cotton\r\nonly. Much of the material from which _yofuku_ are made is no doubt\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n[252] See Appendix LXVIII\r\n\r\n[253] The number of cattle, which was 1,342,587 in 1916, was only\r\n1,307,120 in 1918. See also Appendix LXVI.\r\n\r\n[254] For photographs and particulars of the milk sheep, see my _Free\r\nFarmer in a Free State_.\r\n\r\n[255] The value of the well-bred and well-cared-for goat as a milk and\r\nmanure producer is underestimated. The problem of keeping goats in\r\nsuch a way that they shall not be destructive and shall yield the\r\nmaximum of manure is discussed in my _Case for the Goat_.\r\n\r\n[256] This question as it affects an agricultural country is discussed\r\nin _A Free Farmer in a Free State_.\r\n\r\n[257] There is a consensus of scientific opinion that \"non-meat\r\neating\" races such as the Japanese have longer alimentary tracts than\r\nflesh-eating Europeans. It is difficult to be precise on the subject,\r\nan eminent Western surgeon tells me, for bowels are as contractile as\r\nworms, which at one minute measure 100 units in length and the next\r\nminute have shortened to 30. So much depends on the state at death.\r\n\r\n[258] On the other hand, the Japanese have taken up many new things at\r\nthe point which we in the West have only recently reached. They begin\r\nto produce milk and supply it, not in the milkman's pail, but in\r\nsterilised bottles. They abandon candles and lamps and, practically\r\nskipping gas, adopt electric light or power. The capital invested in\r\nelectric enterprises in 1919 was about 700 million yen or seven times\r\nthat invested in gas.\r\n\r\n[259] There is one blameless form of stock keeping which is developing\r\nin Hokkaido. Bees, which have still to make their way in Old Japan,\r\nare now 6,000 hives strong in the northern island, though a start was\r\nmade only six or seven years ago.\r\n\r\n[260] It is illustrative of the extent to which pickle is\r\nconsumed in Japan that a family in Sapporo was found to have eaten no\r\nfewer than 283 _daikon_ in a year.\r\n\r\n[261] The reader must put away the impression which this table\r\ngives of a varied dietary. Few Japanese have such a range of food. The\r\naverage man habitually lives on rice, bean products (_tofu_, bean\r\njelly and _miso_, soft bean cheese), pickles, vegetables, tea, a\r\nlittle fish and sometimes eggs. People of narrow means see little of\r\neggs and not much fish, unless it be _katsubushi_.\r\n\r\n[262] The watering of vegetables with liquid manure, the usual\r\npractice of the Japanese farmer, and the pollution of the paddies make\r\nsalads and insufficiently cooked green stuff dangerous and many water\r\nsupplies of questionable purity. Great efforts have been made to\r\nprovide safe tap water from the hills. Intestinal parasites are\r\ncommon. The build of the Japanese makes for strength, but in the urban\r\nareas there is much absence from work on the plea of ill-health. Both\r\nin Japan and in England I have been struck by the fact that when I\r\nmade an excursion with an urban Japanese he often tired before I did,\r\nand on none of these trips was I in anything like first-class\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[263] Many Japanese look forward to a great production of wheat on the\r\nnorth-eastern Asiatic mainland under Japanese auspices. In considering\r\nimports of wheat it should be remembered that some of it is used in\r\nsoy and macaroni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nMUST THE JAPANESE MAKE THEIR OWN \"YOFUKU\"?[264]\r\n\r\n\"God damn all foreigners!\"_--Interrupter at one of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nearly meetings at Oxford_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Hokkaido sheep were being experimented with at different\r\nplaces on the mainland, investigators and sheep buyers had gone off to\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and South America, and a Tokyo Sheep Bureau of\r\ntwo dozen officials had been established. Great hopes were built on a\r\nfew hundred sheep in Hokkaido.[265] But I noticed that Government farm\r\nsheep were under cover on a warm September day. Also I heard of\r\ntrouble with two well-known sheep ailments. There was talk\r\nnevertheless of the day when there would be a million sheep in\r\nHokkaido, perhaps three millions. On the mainland I also met high\r\nofficials and enthusiastic prefectural governors who dreamed dreams of\r\nsheep farming in Old Japan, where land is costly, farms small,\r\nagriculture intensive, grazing ground to seek, and farmland\r\nnecessarily damp. This sheep keeping is conceived as one animal or\r\nperhaps two on a holding as rather unhappy by-products. The notion is\r\nthat the wool and manure of a sheep would meet the expense of its keep\r\nand that the mutton would be profit. Hopes of an extension of sheep\r\nbreeding resting on such a basis seem to be extravagant. One high\r\nauthority told me that it would take twenty or thirty years to develop\r\nsheep keeping.\r\n\r\nThe sheep at present in Japan are not living in natural conditions.\r\nThey feed on cultivated crops. Sheep could hardly live a week on\r\nnatural Japanese pasture. The wild herbage is full of the sharp bamboo\r\ngrass. In the summer much of the eatable herbage dries up. Not only\r\nmust sheep endure the summer heat and insects; they must survive the\r\ntrying rainy season. But they must do more than merely endure and\r\nsurvive. In order to produce good wool it is necessary that they shall\r\nbe in good condition. The hair of one's head immediately shows the\r\neffect of imperfect nutrition or unhealthy conditions, and it is the\r\nsame with the wool on the back of the sheep.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the quality of the wool on the sheep kept in Japan\r\ndepreciates. However this may be, it is plain that sheep breeding must\r\nbe conducted on a large scale in order to produce wool in commercial\r\nquantities and of even quality. Some notion of the land normally\r\nrequired for sheep may be estimated from the fact that Australian\r\npasture carries no more than four sheep per acre.[266]\r\n\r\nAn improvement of Japanese herbage sufficient to fit it for sheep\r\nwould be a heavy task even in small areas. It is not only the herbage\r\nbut the rocks below it which are all wrong for sheep, if we are to\r\njudge by the geological formations on which sheep flourish in the\r\nWest. If the sheep were put on cultivated land[267] or placed on straw\r\nas I saw them in Hokkaido there would be serious risks of foot rot. No\r\ndoubt there would also be insect pests to control. If Japan set up\r\nsheep keeping she would no doubt have to devise her own special breed\r\nof sheep, for the well-known Western breeds are artificial products.\r\nProbably the experiments which are being made in China with sheep at\r\nan earlier stage of development are proceeding on the right lines. I\r\nhave already spoken of the fact that a Japanese taste for mutton has\r\nyet to be cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis is a formidable list of difficulties confronting the new\r\nGovernmental Sheep Bureau. No doubt much may be done by a large\r\nexpenditure of money and much patience. The Japanese have wrought\r\nmarvels before by spending money and having a large stock of patience.\r\nAccount must also be taken of the spirit reflected in the speech made\r\nto me by a Japanese friend when I read the foregoing paragraph to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"But we are keen to try. If there were no necessity to prepare for\r\nwar, when we must have wool for soldiers, sailors and officials, we\r\nmight rely on Australia and elsewhere and hope to improve the inferior\r\nand dirty Chinese wool. But thinking of the disease prevailing in\r\nNorthern Manchuria and of service needs, we want to try sheep keeping\r\nwith some subsidy in Hokkaido and on the mainland in Northern Aomori\r\nwhere there is much dry wild land and the farmers are often\r\nmiserable--there are villages where the people do not wash. We might\r\nprovide some of the wool needed by Japan. We have practically met our\r\nneeds in sugar, though of course our needs are small compared with\r\nEngland and America.\"\r\n\r\nLet us turn from the sheep problem to the factory problem. What are\r\nthe difficulties of the woollen industry? In the first place, as we\r\nhave seen, there is no home supply of wool worth mentioning. Further,\r\nthere is the intricacy of woollen manufacture. Cotton machinery has\r\nbeen brought to such a pitch of perfection for every operation and\r\nthere are in existence so many technical manuals for every department\r\nof cotton manufacture that a certain standardisation of output is not\r\ndifficult. The problem of woollen manufacture is much more\r\ncomplicated. The output cannot be similarly standardised, and there\r\nare many directions in which originality, self-reliance and experience\r\ncome into play decisively.\r\n\r\nIn the woollen districts of Great Britain the operatives are people\r\nwho have been in the trade all their lives, whose parents and\r\ngrandparents have been in the trade before them. There is not only an\r\nhereditary aptitude but an hereditary interest. There is not only an\r\nindividual interest but an interest of the whole community. The\r\nwelfare of a town or city is wrapped up in the woollen industry. This\r\nis not so in Japan. The mill workers in the Tokyo prefecture, for\r\nexample, come from remote parts of Japan, and the girls--and\r\nthree-quarters of the employees of the woollen industry are girls--are\r\nmerely on a three-years contract. The girls arrive absolutely\r\ninexperienced. Even in England it is considered that it takes two or\r\nthree years to make a worker skilful. Within the three-years period\r\nfor which the Japanese mill girls or their parents contract, as many\r\nas 30 per cent. leave the mills and, appalling fact, from 20 to 25 per\r\ncent. die.[268] Not more than 10 per cent. renew their three-years\r\ncontract. Therefore there is, at present at any rate, little real\r\nskilled labour in the factories. Another difficulty is the absence of\r\nskilful wool sorters. Even before the War a good wool sorter commanded\r\nin England from £3 to £4 a week. One of the things which hampers the\r\nJapanese woollen industry is the prevalence of illness at the\r\nfactories. They must have, in consequence, about 25 per cent. more\r\nlabour than is needed.\r\n\r\nGenerally one would say that the industry at its present stage is not\r\nonly weak on the labour side,[269] but, where it is efficient, is\r\nskilful rather in imitation than in original design. Everything\r\nproduced is an imitation of foreign designs. That is not an unnatural\r\nstate of things, however, at the commencement of a new industry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the old complaint of Japanese goods failing to come up\r\nto sample, the shortcoming is often due not to intentional dishonesty\r\nbut simply to inability to produce a uniform product. In one factory\r\nan order had to be filled by bringing together work from 300 different\r\nplaces. The first delivery of the cloth produced for the Russian army\r\nwas like the sample, but the later deliveries, though of excellent\r\nmaterial, were not, for the simple reason that the precise raw\r\nmaterials for the required blending did not exist in Japan.\r\n\r\nOne of the marvels of the industry is the high prices obtained in\r\nJapan. The best winter serge was selling in England before the War at\r\n8s. a yard. The Japanese price for winter serge was from 5 to 6 yen.\r\nBefore the War it was possible to import cloth at 50 per cent. less\r\nthan the local rates. Nevertheless there seemed to be a market for\r\neverything. Japanese cloth lacks finish but it is made out of good\r\nmaterials and will wear. The factories are compelled to use a better\r\nquality of material in order to get anywhere near the appearance of\r\nimported goods. A foreign manufacturer, \"owing to his skill in\r\nmanufacture,\" as it was once explained to me, may produce a cloth of a\r\ncertain quality containing only 10 per cent. new wool: the Japanese\r\nmanufacturer, in order to produce a comparable article must use 30 per\r\ncent. new wool. Obviously this means that the Japanese factory must\r\ncharge higher prices.\r\n\r\nIn considering the position of the industry it is natural to ask how\r\nit would be affected if the Japanese factories were able to draw more\r\nlargely upon Manchuria for wool. The answer is that the sheep in\r\nManchuria at present yield what is called \"China\" wool, which is\r\nsuitable only for blankets and coarse cloth.\r\n\r\nTo some who feel a sympathy for Japan in her present stage of\r\nindustrial development and are inclined to take long views it may seem\r\na pity that she should contemplate making such a radical change in her\r\nnational habits as is represented by the demand for woollen materials\r\nand for meat. Japanese dress, easy, hygienic and artistic though it\r\nis, and admirably suited for wearing in Japanese dwellings, is ill\r\nadapted for modern business life, not to speak of factory conditions.\r\nBut it has not yet been demonstrated that Japan is under the necessity\r\nof substituting, to so large an extent as she evidently contemplates\r\ndoing, woollen for cotton and silk clothing, and Western clothing for\r\nher own characteristic raiment.[270] The cotton padded garment and bed\r\ncover are both warm and clean. It is odd that this new demand on the\r\npart of Japan for woollen material should coincide with movements in\r\nEurope and America to utilise more cotton, for underclothing at any\r\nrate. There is undoubtedly a hygienic case of a certain force against\r\nwool. The same is true of meat. It may well be that the dietary of\r\nmany Japanese has not been sufficiently nutritious, but much of the\r\nmeat-eating which is now being indulged in seems to be due more to an\r\naping of foreign ways than to physical requirements. The more meat\r\nJapan eats and the more she dresses herself in wool the more she\r\nplaces herself under the control of the foreigner.[271] Whatever\r\ndegree of success may attend sheep breeding within the limits imposed\r\nupon it by physical conditions in Japan, the raw material of the\r\nwoollen industry must be mostly a foreign product. As far as meat is\r\nconcerned, it is difficult to believe that while the agriculture of\r\nJapan is based upon rice production there is room for the production\r\nof meat on a large scale. If the meat and wool are to be produced in\r\nManchuria and Mongolia we shall see what we shall see. The\r\nsignificance of the experiment of the Manchuria Railway Company since\r\n1913 in crossing merino and Mongolian sheep and the work which is\r\nbeing done on the sheep runs of Baron Okura in Mongolia cannot be\r\noverlooked. Ten years hence it will be interesting to examine\r\nindustrially and socially the position of the woollen industry[272]\r\nand the animal industry in Japan and on the mainland, and the net gain\r\nthat the country has made.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[264] _Yofuku_ means foreign clothes.\r\n\r\n[265] In 1920 there were 8,219 sheep in Japan, including 945 in\r\nHokkaido.\r\n\r\n[266] A sheep produces about 7 lbs. of wool in the year. But this is\r\nthe unscoured weight. In Japan, an expert assured me, it would not\r\nreach more than 56 to 60 per cent. when scoured.\r\n\r\n[267] \"To-day sheep cannot, be kept on arable to leave any reward to\r\nthe farmer.\"--_Country Life_, August 20, 1921.\r\n\r\n[268] See Appendix LXIX.\r\n\r\n[269] See Appendix LXX.\r\n\r\n[270] An immense amount of silk is used in Japanese men's clothing.\r\nThe kimono, except the cheaper summer kind and the bath kimono\r\n_(yukata)_, which are cotton, is silk. So are the _hakama_ (divided\r\nskirt) and the _haori_ (overcoat). Japanese women's clothes are\r\nlargely silk. The dress of working people is cotton, but even they\r\nhave some silk clothing.\r\n\r\n[271] \"By degrees they proceeded to all the stimulations of banqueting\r\nwhich was indeed part of their bondage.\"--Tacitus on the Britons under\r\nRoman influence.\r\n\r\n[272] The industry has already made on the London market an impression\r\nof competence in some directions. For production and exports, see\r\nAppendix LXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEMS OF JAPAN\r\n\r\nConcerning these things, they are not to be delivered but from much\r\nintercourse and discussion.--PLATO\r\n\r\n\r\nEmigrants do not willingly seek a climate worse than their own. This\r\nis one of the reasons why the development of Hokkaido has not been\r\nswifter. The island is not much farther from the mainland than\r\nShikoku, but it is near, not the richest and warmest part of the\r\nmainland, but the poorest and the coldest. If we imagine another\r\nScotland lying off Cape Wrath, at the distance of Ireland from\r\nScotland, and with a climate corresponding to the northerly situation\r\nof such a supposititious island, we may realise how remoteness and\r\nclimatic limitations have hindered the progress of Hokkaido.\r\n\r\n\"Our mode of living is not suited to the colder climate,\" an\r\nagricultural professor said to me. \"Poor emigrants do not have money\r\nenough to build houses with stoves and properly fitting windows.\"\r\n\r\nTo what extent the modified farming methods rendered necessary by the\r\nHokkaido climate have had a deterring effect on would-be settlers I do\r\nnot know. It has never been demonstrated that the Japanese farmer\r\nprefers arduous amphibious labour to the dry-land farming in which\r\nmost of the world's land workers are engaged; but the cultivation of\r\npaddy or a large proportion of paddy is his traditional way of\r\nfarming. Rice culture also means to him the production of the crop\r\nwhich, when weather conditions favour, is more profitable than any\r\nother. In Hokkaido, as we have seen, the remunerative kind of\r\nagriculture is mixed farming, and, in a large part of the country,\r\nrice cannot be grown at all. Against objections to Hokkaido on the\r\nground of the strangeness of its farming may probably be set,\r\nhowever, the cheapness of land there.\r\n\r\nAn undoubted hindrance to the colonisation of Hokkaido has been land\r\nscandals and land grabbing. Many of what the late Lord Salisbury\r\ncalled the \"best bits\" are in the hands of big proprietors or\r\nproprietaries. Some large landowners no doubt show public spirit. But\r\ntheir class has contrived to keep farmers from getting access to a\r\ngreat deal of land which, because of its quality and nearness to\r\npracticable roads and the railway, might have been worked to the best\r\nadvantage. In various parts of Japan I heard complaints. \"The land\r\nsystem in Hokkaido,\" one man in Aichi said to me, \"is so queer that\r\nland cannot be got by the families needing it, I mean good land.\"\r\nAgain in Shikoku I was assured that \"the most desirable parts of the\r\nHokkaido are in the hands of capitalists who welcome tenants only.\" In\r\nmore than one part of northern Japan I was told of emigrants to\r\nHokkaido who had \"returned dissatisfied.\" A charge made against the\r\nlarge holder of Hokkaido land is that he is an absentee and a city man\r\nwho lacks the knowledge and the inclination to devote the necessary\r\ncapital to the development of his estate. Of late the rise in the\r\nvalue of timber has induced not a few proprietors to interest\r\nthemselves much more in stripping their land of trees than in\r\ndeveloping its agricultural possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe development of Hokkaido may also have been slowed down to some\r\nextent by a lower level of education among the people than is\r\ncustomary on most of the mainland, by a rougher and less skilful\r\nfarming than is common in Old Japan and by the existence of a residuum\r\nwhich would rather \"deal\" or \"let George do it\" or cheat the Ainu than\r\nfollow the laborious colonial life. But no cause has been more potent\r\nthan a lack of money in the public treasury. I was told that for five\r\nyears in succession Tokyo had cut down the Hokkaido budget. Necessary\r\npublic work and schemes for development have been repeatedly stopped.\r\nAt a time when the interests of Hokkaido demand more farmers and there\r\nis a general complaint of lack of labour, at a time when there are\r\npersistent pleas for oversea expansion, there are in Japan twice or\r\nthrice as many people applying for land in the island as are granted\r\nentry. The blunt truth is that the State has felt itself compelled to\r\nspend so much on military and naval expansion that the claims of\r\nHokkaido for the wherewithal for better roads, more railway line and\r\nbetter credit have often been put aside.[273]\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, that slow progress in the development of\r\nHokkaido gives an opening to the critics of Japan who doubt whether\r\nher need for expansion beyond her own territory is as pressing as is\r\nrepresented by some writers. However this may be, Hokkaido is stated\r\nto take only a tenth of the overplus of the population of Old Japan.\r\nThe number of emigrants in 1913 was no larger than the number in 1906.\r\nA usual view in Hokkaido is that the island can hold twice as many\r\npeople as it now contains. \"When 3,625,000 acres are brought into\r\ncultivation,\" says an official publication, \"Hokkaido will be able\r\neasily to maintain 5,000,000 inhabitants on her own products.\"\r\n\r\nVery much of what has been achieved in Hokkaido has been done under\r\nthe stimulating influence of the Agricultural College, now the\r\nUniversity. The northern climate seems to be conducive to mental\r\nvigour in both professors and students. If in moving about Hokkaido\r\none is conscious of a somewhat materialistic view of progress it may\r\nbe remembered that an absorption in \"getting on\" is characteristic of\r\ncolonists and their advisers everywhere. It is not high ideals of life\r\nbut bitter experience of inability to make a living on the mainland\r\nwhich has brought immigrants to Hokkaido. As time goes on, the rural\r\nand industrial development may have a less sordid look.[274] At\r\npresent the visitor who lacks time to penetrate into the fastnesses\r\nof Hokkaido and enjoy its natural beauties brings away the unhappy\r\nimpression which is presented by a view of man's first assault on the\r\nwild.\r\n\r\nBut he must still be glad to have seen this distant part of Japan. He\r\nfinds there something stimulating and free which seems to be absent\r\nfrom the older mainland. It is possible that when Hokkaido shall have\r\nworked out her destiny she may not be without her influence on the\r\ndevelopment of Old Japan. Those of the settlers who are reasonably\r\nwell equipped in character, wits and health are not only making the\r\nliving which they failed to obtain at home; they are testing some\r\nnational canons of agriculture. Face to face with strangers and with\r\nnew conditions, these immigrants are also examining some ideals of\r\nsocial life and conduct which, old though they are, may not be\r\nperfectly adapted to the new age into which Japan has forced herself.\r\nOne evening in Hokkaido I saw a lone cottage in the hills. At its door\r\nwas the tall pole on which at the _Bon_ season the lantern is hung to\r\nguide the hovering soul of that member of the family who has died\r\nduring the year. The settler's lantern, steadily burning high above\r\nhis hut, was an emblem of faith that man does not live by gain alone\r\nwhich the hardest toil cannot quench. In whatever guise it may express\r\nitself, it is the best hope for Hokkaido and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in the island I had an opportunity of meeting some of\r\nthe most influential men from the Governor downwards; also several\r\ninteresting visitors from the mainland. We often found ourselves\r\ngetting away from Hokkaido's problems to the general problems of rural\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOf the good influences at work in the village, the first I was once\r\nmore assured, was \"popular education and school ethics, a real\r\ninfluence and blessing.\" The second was \"the disciplinary training of\r\nthe army for regularity of conduct.\" (\"The influence of officers on\r\ntheir young soldiers is good, and they give them or provide them with\r\nlectures on agricultural subjects and allow them time to go in\r\ncompanies to experimental farms.\")\r\n\r\nSomeone spoke of \"the influence of the religion of the past.\" \"The\r\nreligion of the past!\" exclaimed an elderly man; \"in half a dozen\r\nprefectures it may be that religion is a rural force, but elsewhere in\r\nthe Empire there is a lack of any moral code that takes deep root in\r\nthe head. After all Christians are more trustworthy than people\r\ndrinking and playing with geisha.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand a prominent Christian said: \"There is a weakness in\r\nour Christians, generally speaking. There is an absence of a sound\r\nfaith. The native churches have no strong influence on rural life.\r\nThere is often a certain priggishness and pride in things foreign in\r\nsaying, 'I am a Christian.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother man spoke in this wise: \"I have been impressed by some of the\r\nfollowing of Uchimura. They seem ardent and real. But I have also been\r\nattracted by strength of character in members of various sects of\r\nChristians. The theology and phraseology of these men may be curious,\r\nmay be in many respects behind the times, but their religion had a\r\nbeautiful aspect.[275] Many of our people have got something of\r\nChristian ethics, but are no church-goers. Some Japanese try to\r\ncombine Christian principles with old Japanese virtues; others with\r\nsome soul supporting Buddhistic ideas. We must have Christianity if\r\nonly to supply a great lack in our conception of personality. People\r\nwho have accepted Christianity show so much more personality and so\r\nmuch more interest in social reform.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to agricultural conditions, one who spoke with\r\nauthority said: \"In Old Japan the agricultural system has become\r\ndwarfed. The individual cannot raise the standard of living nor can\r\ncrops be substantially increased. The whole economy is too small.[276]\r\nThe people are too close on the ground. They must spread out to\r\nnorth-eastern Japan, to Hokkaido, Korea and Manchuria. The population\r\nof Korea could be greatly increased. There is an immense opening in\r\nManchuria, which is four or five times the area of the Japanese Empire\r\nand sparsely populated. There is also Mongolia.\"[277]\r\n\r\n\"But in Korea,\" one who had been there said, \"there are the Koreans,\r\nan able if backward people, to be considered--they will increase with\r\nthe spread of our sanitary methods among a population which was\r\nreduced by a primitive hygiene and by maladministration. And as to our\r\npeople going to the mainland of Asia, we do not really like to go\r\nwhere rice is not the agricultural staple, and we prefer a warm\r\ncountry. In Formosa, where it is warm, we are faced by the competition\r\nof the Chinese at a lower standard of life.[278] The perfect places\r\nfor Japanese are California, New Zealand and Australia, but the\r\nAmericans and Australasians won't have us. I do not complain; we do\r\nnot allow Chinese labour in Japan. But we think that we might have had\r\nAustralasia or New Zealand if we had not been secluded from the world\r\nby the Tokugawa régime, and so allowed you British to get there first.\r\nIt is not strange that some of our dreamers should grudge you your\r\nplace there, should cherish ideas of expansion by walking in your\r\nfootsteps. But it is wisdom to realise that we cannot do to-day what\r\nmight have been done centuries ago or make history repeat itself for\r\nour benefit. It is wiser to seek to reduce the amount of\r\nmisapprehension, prejudice and--shall I say?--national feeling in\r\nJapan and America and Australasia, and try to procure ultimate\r\naccommodation for us all in that way. But not too much reduce,\r\nperhaps, for, in the present posture of the world, nationalist\r\nfeeling and--we do not want premature inter-marriage--racial feeling\r\nare still valuable to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nA speaker who followed said: \"Remember to our credit how our area\r\nunder cultivation in Old Japan continually increases.[279] Bear in\r\nmind, too, what good use we have made of the land we have been able to\r\nget under cultivation--so many thousand more _chō_ of crops than there\r\nare _chō_ of land, due, of course, to the two or three crops a year\r\nsystem in many areas.\"[280]\r\n\r\n\"As for the situation the emigrants[281] leave behind them in Old\r\nJapan,\" resumed the first speaker, \"the experiment should be tried of\r\nputting ten or so of tiny holdings[282] under one control, and an\r\nattempt should be made to see what improved implements and further\r\nco-operation[283] can effect. I suppose the thing most needed on the\r\nmainland is working capital at a moderate rate. Think of 900 million\r\nyen of farmers' debt, much of it at 12 per cent. and some of it at 20\r\nper cent.! I do not reckon the millions of prefectural, county and\r\nvillage debt. Of what value is it to raise the rice crop to 3 or 4\r\n_koku_ per _tan_ (60 or 80 bushels per acre)[284] if the moneylender\r\nprofits most? The farmers of Old Japan are undoubtedly losing land to\r\nthe moneyed people.[285] Every year the number of farmers owning their\r\nown land decreases[286] and the number of tenants increases and more\r\ncountry people go to the towns.[287] And, as an official statement\r\nsays, 'the physical condition of the army conscripts from the rural\r\ndistricts is always superior to that of the conscripts of the urban\r\ndistricts.'\"\r\n\r\nSome Western criticism of Japanese agriculture cannot be\r\noverlooked.[288] Criticism is naturally invited by (1) Japanese\r\ndevotion to what is in Western eyes an exotic crop--but owing to\r\nexceptional water supplies, favourable climatic conditions and\r\nacquired skill in cultivation, the best crop for all but the extreme\r\nnorth-east of Japan;[289] (2) the small portions in which much of that\r\ncrop is grown--of necessity; (3) the primitive implements--not\r\nill-adapted, however, to a primitive cultural system; (4) the\r\nnon-utilisation of animal or mechanical power in a large part of the\r\ncountry--due as much to physical conditions as to lack of cheap\r\ncapital; (5) what is spoken of as \"the never-ending toil\"--against\r\nwhich must be set the figures I have quoted showing the number of\r\nfarmers who do not work on an average more than 4 or 5 days a week;\r\nand (6) the moderate total production compared with the number of\r\nproducers--which must be considered in reference to the object of\r\nJapanese agriculture and in relation to a lower standard of living.\r\nJapanese agriculture, as we have seen, has shortcomings, many of which\r\nare being steadily met; but with all its shortcomings it does succeed\r\nin providing, for a vast population per square _ri_, subsistence in\r\nconditions which are in the main endurable and might be easily made\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nPaddy adjustment has clearly shown that paddies above the average size\r\nare more economically worked than small ones, but these adjusted\r\npaddies are on the plains and a large proportion of Japanese paddies\r\nhave had to be made on uneven or hilly ground where physical\r\nconditions make it impossible for these rice fields to be anything\r\nelse than small and irregular. Japanese agriculture is what it is and\r\nmust largely remain what it is because Japan is geologically and\r\nclimatically what it is, and because the social development of a large\r\npart of Japan is what it is. Comparisons with rice culture in Texas,\r\nCalifornia and Italy are usually made in forgetfulness of the fact\r\nthat the rice fields there are generally on level fertile areas, in\r\nAmerica sometimes on virgin soil. In Japan rice culture extends to\r\npoor unfavourable land because the people want to have rice\r\neverywhere.[290] The Japanese have cultivated the same paddies for\r\ncenturies, Some American rice land is thrown out of cultivation after\r\na few years. In fertile localities the Japanese get twice the average\r\ncrop. It must also be remembered that Japanese paddies often produce\r\ntwo crops, a crop of rice and an after-crop. Japanese technicians are\r\nwell acquainted with Texan, Californian and Italian rice culture, and\r\nJapanese have tried rice production both in California and Texas.\r\n\r\n\"They talk of Texan and Italian rice culture,\" said one man who had\r\nbeen abroad on a mission of agricultural investigation, \"but I found\r\nthe comparative cost of rice production greater in Texas than in\r\nJapan. Some Japanese farmers who went to Texas were overcome by weeds\r\nbecause of dear labour. In Italian paddies, also, I saw many more\r\nweeds than in ours. It is rational, of course, for Americans and\r\nItalians to use improved machinery, for they have expensive labour\r\nconditions, but we have cheap labour. The Texans have large paddies\r\nbecause their land is cheap, but ours is dear. In these big paddies\r\nthe water cannot be kept at two or three inches, as with us. It is\r\nnecessarily five inches or so, too deep, and the soil temperature\r\nfalls and they lose on the crops what they gain by the use of\r\nmachinery. Further, it must be remembered that we are not producing\r\nour rice for export. It is a special kind for ourselves, which we\r\nlike;[291] but foreigners would just as soon have any other sort. We\r\nhave no call, therefore, to develop our rice culture in the same\r\ndegree as our sericulture, which rests mainly on a valuable oversea\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"On this general question of improvement of implements and methods,\"\r\nsaid another member of our company, \"we must use machinery and\r\ncombine farming management when industrial progress drives us to it;\r\nbut why try to do it before we are compelled? Concerning horses, the\r\ndifficulty which some farmers have in using them is the difficulty of\r\nfeeding them economically. Concerning cereals, our consumption is not\r\nless than that of Germany, but Germany imports more than twice the\r\ncereals we do, so there would seem to be something to be said for our\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING GRASS]\r\n\r\n\"Some revolutionising of Japanese farming is necessary, in combined\r\nthreshing, for instance,\" the expert who had opened our discussion\r\nsaid. \"This combined threshing is now seen in several districts, and\r\ncombined threshing will be extended. But there is the objection to the\r\nthreshing machine that it breaks the straw and thus spoils it for\r\nfarmers' secondary industries. It should not be impossible to invent\r\nsome way of avoiding this, but the threshing machine is also too heavy\r\nfor narrow roads between paddies. It is difficult to deliver the crops\r\nto the machine in sufficient bulk. Necessity may show us ways, but\r\nsmall threshing machines are not so economical. Of course we must have\r\nmuch more co-operative buying of rural requirements, and certainly\r\nthere is room in some places for the Western scythe made smaller, but\r\nour people, as you have seen, are dexterous with their extremely\r\nsharp, short sickle, and fodder is often cut on rather difficult\r\nslopes, from which it is not easy to descend loaded, with a scythe.\r\nSome foreigners who speak so positively about machinery for paddies,\r\nand for, I suppose, the sloping uplands to which our arable farming is\r\nrelegated, do not really grasp the physical conditions of our\r\nagriculture. And they are always forgetting the warm dankness of our\r\nclimate. They forget, too, that implements for hand use are more\r\nefficient than machinery, and, if labour be cheap, more economical.\r\nThey forget above all that we are of necessity a small-holdings\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nIs it such a bad thing to be a small-holdings country? Does the rural\r\nlife of countries which are pre-eminently small-holding, like Denmark\r\nand Holland, compare so unfavourably with that of England? I wonder\r\nhow much money has been sunk--most of it lost--during the past quarter\r\nof a century in attempts to increase small holdings in England.\r\n\r\n\"Because we have much remote, wild, uncultivated land,\" the speaker I\r\nhave interrupted continued, \"that is not to say that most of it, often\r\nat a high elevation, or sloping, or poor in quality, as well as\r\nremote, can be profitably broken up for paddies. Much of this land can\r\nbe and ought to be utilised in one fashion or another, but we have\r\nfound some experiments in this direction unprofitable, even when rice\r\nwas dear. But it may be said, Why break up this wild land into\r\npaddies? Why not have nice grassy slopes for cattle as in Switzerland?\r\nBut our experts have tried in vain to get grass established. The heavy\r\nrains and the heat enable the bamboo grass to overcome the new fodder\r\ngrass we have sown. The first year the fodder grass grows nicely, but\r\nthe second year the bamboo grass conquers. In Hokkaido and Saghalien\r\nwe are conquering bamboo grass with fodder grass. The advice to go in\r\nlargely for fruit ignores the fact of our steamy damp climate, which\r\nencourages sappy growth, disease and those insects which are so\r\nnumerous in Japan. We cannot do much more than grow for home\r\nconsumption.\"\r\n\r\n\"The advice to draw the cultivation of our small farms under group\r\ncontrol has not always been profitable when followed by landlords,\"\r\none who had not yet spoken remarked. \"They have not always made more\r\nwhen they farmed themselves than when they let their land. All the\r\nworld over, land workers do better for themselves than for others.\r\nProposals further to capitalise farming which, with a rural exodus\r\nalready going on, would have the effect of driving people off the land\r\nwho are employed on it healthily and with benefit to the social\r\norganism, do not seem to offer a more satisfactory situation for\r\nJapan. No country has shown itself less afraid of business combination\r\nthan Japan, and the world owes as much to industry as to agriculture,\r\nand I am not in the least afraid of machinery and capital; but\r\nproduction is not our final aim. Production is to serve us; we are not\r\nto serve production. If people can live in self-respect on the land\r\nthey are better off in many ways than if they are engaged in industry\r\nin some of its modern developments.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world is also better off,\" my interpreter in his notes records me\r\nas saying when I was pressed to state my opinion. \"The day will come\r\nwhen the uselessness and waste of a certain proportion of industry and\r\ncommerce will be realised, when the saving power of an export and\r\nimport trade in unnecessary things will be questioned and when the\r\ncultivator of the ground will be restored to the place in social\r\nprecedence he held in Old Japan. With him will rank the other real\r\nproducers in art, literature and science, industry and commerce. The\r\nindustrialisation of the West and its capitalistic system have not\r\nbeen so perfectly successful in their social results for it to be\r\ncertain that Japan should be hurried more quickly in the industrial\r\nand capitalistic direction than she is travelling already.[292] If she\r\ntakes time over her development, the final results may be better for\r\nher and for the world. I have not noticed that Japanese rural people\r\nwho have departed from a simple way of life through the acquirement of\r\nmany farms or the receipt of factory dividends have become worthier.\r\nOn the question of the alleged over-population of rural Japan, one\r\nJapanese investigator has suggested to me that as many as 20 per\r\ncent. could be advantageously spared from agricultural labour. But he\r\nwas not himself an agriculturist or an ex-agriculturist. He was not\r\neven a rural resident. Further, he conceived his 20 per cent. as\r\nentering rural rather than urban industry.\r\n\r\n\"A great deal of afforestation and better use of a large proportion of\r\nforest land, much more co-operation for borrowing and buying, improved\r\nimplements where improved implements can be profitably used, animal\r\nand mechanical power where they can be employed to advantage, paddy\r\nadjustment to the limit of the practical, more intelligent manuring, a\r\nwider use of better seeds,[293] the bringing in of new land which is\r\ncapable of yielding a profit when an adequate expenditure is made upon\r\nit, a mental and physical education which is ever improving--all\r\nthese, joined to better ways of life generally, are obvious avenues of\r\nimprovement, in Northern Japan particularly, not to speak of\r\nHokkaido.[294] But it is not so much the details of improvement that\r\nseem urgently to need attention. It is the general principles. I have\r\nbeen assured again and again by prefectural governors and agricultural\r\nexperts--and in talking to a foreigner they would hardly be likely to\r\nexaggerate--that considered plans for the prevention of disastrous\r\nfloods, for the breaking up of new land, for the provision of loans\r\nand for the development of public intelligence and well-being were\r\nhindered in their areas by lack of money alone. The degree to which\r\nrural improvements, with which the best interests of Japan now and in\r\nthe future are bound up, may have been arrested and may still be\r\narrested by erroneous conceptions of national progress and of the ends\r\nto which public energy and public funds[295] may be wisely devoted is\r\na matter for patriotic reflection.[296] No impression I have gained\r\nin Japan is sharper than an impression of ardent patriotism. For good\r\nor ill, patriotism is the outstanding Japanese virtue. What some\r\npatriots here and elsewhere do not seem to realise, however, is what a\r\nquiet, homely, everyday thing true patriotism is. The Japanese, with\r\nso many talents, so many natural and fortuitous advantages, and with\r\nopportunities, such as no other nation has enjoyed, of being able to\r\nprofit by the social, economic and international experience of States\r\nthat have bought their experience dearly and have much to rue, cannot\r\nfairly expect to be lightly judged by contemporaries or by history. If\r\nthe course taken by Japan towards national greatness is at times\r\nuncertain, it is due no doubt to the fascinations of many\r\nwill-o'-the-wisps. There can be one basis only for the enlightened\r\njudgment of the world on the Japanese people: the degree to which they\r\nare able to distinguish the true from the mediocre and the resolution\r\nand common-sense with which they take their own way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our rural problems,\" a sober-minded young professor added, after one\r\nof those pauses which are usual in conversations in Japan, \"is not a\r\ntechnical problem, not even an economic problem. It is, as you have\r\nrealised, a sociological problem. It is bound up with the mental\r\nattitude of our people--and with the mental attitude of the whole\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[273] A high authority assured me that 100 million yen (pre-War\r\nfigures) could be laid out to advantage. A Japanese economist's\r\ncomment was: \"Why not touch on the extraordinary proportion of land\r\nowned by the Imperial Household and also by the State for military\r\npurposes?\"\r\n\r\n[274] In driving through what seemed to be one of the best streets in\r\nSapporo, I noticed that some exceptionally large houses were the\r\ndwellings of the registered prostitutes. Each house had a large\r\nground-floor window. Before it was a barrier about a yard high which\r\ncleared the ground, leaving a space of about another yard. Such of the\r\npublic as were interested were able, therefore, to peer in without\r\nbeing identified from the street, for only their legs and feet were\r\nvisible. In Tokyo and elsewhere this exhibition of girls to the public\r\nhas ceased. The place of the girls is taken by enlarged framed\r\nphotographs. I found on enquiry that the Sapporo houses are so well\r\norganised as to have their proprietors' association. At a little town\r\nlike Obihiro an edifice was pointed out to me containing fifty or more\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[275] The classification is 101,671 Protestants, 75,983 Roman\r\nCatholics and 36,265 Greek Church.\r\n\r\n[276] \"'Spade farming' is an apt designation of the system of farming\r\nor rather of cultivation, for little is done in the way of raising\r\nstock.\"--PROFESSOR YOKOI.\r\n\r\n[277] See Appendix XXX.\r\n\r\n[278] But surely the basic reason against a large emigration of\r\nfarmers and artisans to Formosa, or to Manchuria, Mongolia or Korea,\r\nwith the intention of working at their callings, is that the standard\r\nof living is lower there? The chief attraction of America and\r\nAustralasia is that the standard of living is higher. The question of\r\nover-population must be considered in relation to the facts in\r\nAppendices XXV, XXX and LXXX, and on page 331. It is not established\r\nthat the Japanese have now, or are likely to have in the near future,\r\na pressing need to emigrate.\r\n\r\n[279] See Appendix LXXII.\r\n\r\n[280] See Appendix LXXIII.\r\n\r\n[281] See Appendix LXXIV.\r\n\r\n[282] Between 1909 and 1918 the average area of holdings rose from\r\n1.03 to 1.09 _chō_ or from 2.52 to 2.67 acres or 1.02 to 1.08\r\nhectares.\r\n\r\n[283] There were in 1919 some 13,000 co-operative societies of all\r\nsorts. The number increases about 500 a year.\r\n\r\n[284] For rise in production per _tan_, see Appendix LXXV.\r\n\r\n[285] See Appendix LXXVI.\r\n\r\n[286] See Appendix LXXVII.\r\n\r\n[287] See Appendix LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n[288] See, for example, C.V. Sale in the _Transactions of the Society\r\nof Arts_, 1907, and J.M. McCaleb in the _Transactions of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Japan_, 1916.\r\n\r\n[289] For the question, is rice the right crop for Japan? See Appendix\r\nLXXIX.\r\n\r\n[290] Dr. Yahagi in an address delivered in Italy pointed out to his\r\naudience that Japan had 15 times as large an area under rice as Italy\r\nand that, while the Italian harvest ranged between 42 and 83\r\nhectolitres per hectare, the Japanese ranged between 55 and 130. The\r\narea under rice in the United States in 1920 was 1,337,000 acres and\r\nthe yield 53,710,000 bushels. The area under rice has steadily\r\nincreased since 1913, when it was only 25,744,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n[291] A well-informed Japanese who read this Chapter doubted the\r\nability of his countrymen to distinguish between native and Korean,\r\nCalifornian or Texan rice. Saigon is another matter. See Appendix\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n[292] \"Some of our statesmen,\" notes a Japanese reader of this\r\nChapter, \"are carried away by ideas of an industrial El Dorado.\" Such\r\nmen have no understanding of the relation of rural Japan to the\r\nnational welfare. They are as blind guides as the Japanese who, caught\r\nby the glamour of the West, threw away the artistic treasures of their\r\nforefathers and pulled down beautiful temples and _yashiki_. Japan has\r\nmuch to gain from a wise and just industrial system, but not a little\r\nof the present industrialisation is an exploitation of cheap labour, a\r\ndestruction of craftsmanship and social obligation, and an attempt to\r\ncut out the foreigner by the production of rubbish.\r\n\r\n[293] The chairman of Rothamsted declares as I write that the standard\r\nof English farming could be raised 50 per cent. Hall and Voelcker have\r\nestimated that 20 million tons of farmyard manure made in the United\r\nKingdom is wasted through avoidable causes.\r\n\r\n[294] For a discussion of the question of inner colonisation versus\r\nforeign expansion, see Appendix LXXX.\r\n\r\n[295] For figures bearing on the relative importance of agriculture,\r\ncommerce and industry, see Appendix LXXXI.

The speaker began\r\nby inheriting 3 _chō_ (7-1/2 acres). He farmed a _chō_ of rice field\r\nand about a third of a _chō_ of dry land. With rent from the part he\r\nlet, with gains from the part he farmed and with interest on 2,000 yen\r\nspare capital, he had at end of the year a balance of 370 yen. With\r\nthe money gained from year to year more and more land was bought. At\r\nthe time of his talk with me he owned 8 _chō_. His net income, after\r\ndeducting cost of living, was 1,200 yen (including 500 yen from the\r\nland that was let). In the future, when he farmed 7 _chō_ (15-1/2\r\nacres), he believed that his balance would be 4,500 yen, which is the\r\nsalary of a Governor! Or was, until the rise in prices when Governors'\r\nsalaries were raised about another 1,000 yen, with an additional\r\nallowance of from 600 to 400 yen in the case of some prefectures. See\r\nalso Appendix III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GETA\" [II]. The _geta_ is a flat piece of hard wood, about the length\r\nof the foot but a little wider, with two stumpy pieces fastened\r\ntransversely below it. The foot maintains an uncertain and, in the\r\ncase of a novice whose big toe has not been accustomed to separation\r\nfrom its fellows, a painful hold by means of a toe strap of thick rope\r\nor cotton. To persons unused from childhood to the special toe grip\r\nand scuffle of the _geta_, it seems odd to associate with this\r\ndifficult clattering footgear the idea of \"luxury.\" But no pains are\r\nspared by the _geta_ makers in choosing fine woods and pretty cords.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDGETS OF LARGE PROPERTY OWNERS [III].

I never noticed a case in which earth was thrown\r\ninto the domestic closet tub according to Dr. Poore's system. I have\r\ncome across attempts to use deodorisers, but the application of a\r\ngermicide is inhibited because of the injury which would be caused to\r\nthe crops. Farmers are chary about removing night soil which has been\r\ntreated even with a deodoriser. I ventured to suggest more than once\r\nthat Japanese science should be equal to evolving a deodoriser to\r\nwhich the farmer, who in Japan seems to be so easily directed, could\r\nhave no objection. The drawback to using Dr. Poore's system is that\r\nthe added earth would greatly increase the weight of the substance to\r\nbe removed. There would be the same objection to the use of _hibachi_\r\nash (charcoal ash), but there is not enough produced to have any\r\nsensible effect. The truth is that there is no lively interest in the\r\nquestion of getting rid of the stink for everyone has become\r\naccustomed to it. The odour from the _benjo_--the politer word is\r\n_habakari_--which is always indoors, though at the end of the _engawa_\r\n(verandah), often penetrates the house. (_Engawa_ [edge or border] is\r\nthe passage which faces to the open; _roka_ is a passage inside a\r\nhouse between two rooms or sometimes a bridgelike passage in the open,\r\nconnecting two separate buildings or parts of a house.) Emptying day\r\nis particularly trying. This much must be said, however, that the\r\nfarmers' tubs are washed, scrubbed and sunned after every journey and\r\nhave close-fitting lids. And primitive though the _benjo_ is, it is\r\nscrupulously clean. Also, if it is always more or less smelly, it is\r\ncontrived on sound hygienic principles. There is no seat requiring an\r\nunnatural position. The user squats over an opening in the floor about\r\n2 ft. long by 6 ins. wide. This opening is encased by a simple\r\nporcelain fitting with a hood at the end facing the user. The top of\r\nthe tub is some distance below the floor. In peasants' houses there is\r\nno porcelain fitting. Manure is so valuable in Japan that farmers\r\nwhose land adjoins the road often build a _benjo_ for the use of\r\npassers-by. Although the traveller in Japan has much to endure from\r\nthe unpleasant odour due to the thrifty utilisation of excreta, the\r\nJapanese deserve credit for the fact that their countryside is never\r\nfouled in the disgusting fashion which proves many of our rural folk\r\nto be behind the primitive standard of civilisation set up in\r\nDeuteronomy (chap, xxiii. 13). The Western rural sociologist is not\r\ninclined to criticise the sanitary methods of Japan. He is too\r\nconscious of the neglect in the West to study thoroughly the grave\r\nquestion of sewage disposal in relation to the needs of our crops and\r\nthe cost of nitrogenous fertilisers. See also Appendix XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS [V]. In Mr. Yamasaki's school there was dormitory\r\naccommodation for 200 youths, some 40 lived in teachers' houses,\r\nanother 15 were in lodgings, and 45 came daily from their parents'\r\nhomes. Lads were admitted from 14 to 16 and the course was for 3\r\nyears. The students worked 30 hours weekly indoors and the rest of\r\ntheir time outside. Upper and lower grade agricultural schools number\r\n280 with 23,000 students. In addition there are 7,908 agricultural\r\ncontinuation schools with more than 430,000 pupils. The ratio of\r\nilliteracy in Japan for men of conscription age (that is, excluding\r\nold people and young people), which had been over 5 per cent. up to\r\n1911, was reported to be only 2 per cent. in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIME [VI]. In 1916 the chief offences in Japan were:\r\n\r\nDealt with at police station  445,502\r\nGambling and lotteries         81,649\r\nLarceny                        81,063\r\nFraud and usurpation           49,772\r\nAssaults                       19,022\r\nRobbery                        10,383\r\nArson                           9,533\r\nAccidental assaults             3,277\r\nObscenity                       2,796\r\nWilful injury                   2,032\r\nMurder                          1,886\r\nAbortion                        1,252\r\nAbduction                         907\r\nRioting                           813\r\nOfficial disgrace                 481\r\nMilitary and naval                387\r\nDesertion                         315\r\nForgery                           307\r\nCoining                           206\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSTITUTES [VII]. The chief of police was good enough to let me have\r\na copy of the form to be filled up by girls desiring to enter the\r\nhouses in the prefecture. It is under nine heads: 1. The reason for\r\nadopting the profession. 2. Age. 3. Permission of head of household.\r\nIf permission is not forthcoming, reason why. 4. If a minor, proof of\r\npermission. 5. House at which the girl is going to \"work.\" 6. Home\r\naddress. 7. Former means of getting a living. 8. Whether prostitute\r\nbefore. If so, particulars. 9. Other details.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Japan there were reputed to be about 50,000 _joro_\r\n(prostitutes), about half that number of geisha and about 35,000\r\n\"waitresses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILANTHROPIC AGENCIES [VIII]. In 1917 the number of paupers, tramps\r\nand foundlings relieved by the State did not exceed 10,000. The number\r\nof institutions was 730 (of which 40 were run by foreigners), with the\r\nexpenditure of about 5-1/2 million yen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN RURAL STATUS [IX]. It seemed that during 47 years 18\r\ntenants had become peasant proprietors, 14 peasant proprietors had\r\nbecome landowners (that is men who make their living by letting land\r\nrather than by working it), 8 tenants had stepped straightway into the\r\nposition of landowners, 7 landowners had fallen to the grade of\r\npeasant proprietors and 7 more to that of tenants, while 114\r\nhouseholders had changed their callings or had gone to Hokkaido.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOURS OF WORK PER DAY [X]. One of these villages showed that during\r\nJanuary and February it worked 6 hours, during March and April 8\r\nhours, from May to August 12-1/2 hours, during September and October\r\n9-1/2 hours, and during November and December 9 hours. There was a\r\nfurther record of labour at night. In January and February it worked\r\nfrom 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m., during March and April and September and\r\nOctober from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and in November and December from 7\r\np.m. to 10 p.m. As in the period from May to August inclusive the day\r\nworking hours were from 5 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., there then was no night\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\nDILIGENT PEOPLE AND OTHERS [XI]. The adults of the village were\r\nclassified as follows: Diligent people, men 294, women 260; average\r\nworkers, men 270, women 236; other people, men 242, women 191. One\r\nsupposes that, in considering the women's activities, all that was\r\nestimated was the number of hours spent in agricultural work or in\r\nremunerative employment in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM AREAS AND DAYS WORKED IN THE YEAR [XII]. The information\r\nconcerned three typical peasant proprietors, A, B and C, living in the\r\nsame county. The areas of their land are given in _tan_:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  |Where farming |Paddy |Dry |Homestead |Rented  |Children |Parents |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA |In hills      |6     |3   |1         |  --    |3        |2       |\r\nB |On plain      |6.6   |2.6 |.5        |2 paddy |3        |2       |\r\nC |Near town     |6     |4   |1         |  --    |3        |-       |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNext we are told the number of days that not only A, B and C but their\r\nwives and their parents worked and did not work during the year:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             |            |Domestic |National   |        |Remaining\r\n             |Agriculture |Work     |Holidays & |Illness |Days\r\n             |            |         |Festivals  |        |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         {A  |254         | 28      |25         | 6      |52\r\nHusbands {B  |239         | 37      |25         | -      |64\r\n         {C  |231         | 49      |19         | 2      |64\r\n             |            |         |           |        |\r\n         {A  |239         | 54      | 7         | -      |64\r\nWives    {B  |150         |128      |26         | -      |64\r\n         {C  |141         |174      | 9         | -      |41\r\n             |            |         |           |        |\r\n         {A  |144         | 47      |85         |18      |72\r\nFathers  {B  |205         | 69      |40         | -      |51\r\n         {C  | -          | -       | -         | -      | -\r\n             |            |         |           |        |\r\n         {A  | 15         |324      | 6         | -      |20\r\nMothers  {B  | 82         |220      |23         | -      |41\r\n         {C  | -          | -       | -         | -      | -\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that men only were ill! [See next page.]\r\n\r\nFor average of hours worked elsewhere, see page 232 and page 237.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' EARNINGS AND SPENDINGS [XIII]. If the reader should feel that\r\nthe following details are lacking in comprehensiveness or\r\ndefiniteness, he should understand that reports of a national and\r\nauthoritative character on the economic condition of the farmer were\r\nnot available. There existed certain reports of the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture, but they were subjected to criticism. The National\r\nAgricultural Association had set on foot an elaborate enquiry as to\r\nthe condition of the \"middle farmer,\" but it was suggested that too\r\nmuch reliance was placed on arithmetical calculations and too little\r\non known facts. I have had to rely, therefore, on official and private\r\ninvestigations made in various prefectures and villages, and I give a\r\nselection for what they are worth. Of the general condition of the\r\nagricultural population the reader is offered the impressions recorded\r\nin my different Chapters.\r\n\r\nINCOMES AND EXPENDITURES OF PEASANT PROPRIETORS.--\r\n\r\nThe incomes and expenditures of the three households referred to in\r\nAppendix XII were:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n    |Income |Expenditure |Balance in hand\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n    |yen    |yen         |yen\r\n  A |477    |449         |28\r\n  B |915    |838         |77\r\n  C |971    |703         |68\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURES.--The household expenditures of the three\r\nfamilies were, in yen:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n                    |A      |B      |C\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n                    |yen    |yen    |yen\r\nFood                |192.76 |216.64 |189.57\r\nHouse               |  2.32 |  2.24 |  1.20\r\nClothes             | 18.72 | 15.16 | 10.08\r\nFuel                | 12.72 | 13.53 | 21.00\r\nTools and furniture | 10.97 |160.18 |  1.66\r\nSocial intercourse  |  9.58 |  --   |  6.05\r\nEducation           |  1.56 |  --   |  4.15\r\nAmusement           |  3.30 |  2.03 | 18.00\r\nUnforeseen          |  7.85 | 13.72 | 22.33\r\nMiscellaneous       |  6.43 |  7.71 | 11.15\r\n                    |-------|-------|------\r\n                    |266.21 |431.21 |285.19\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the expenditure of B under the\r\nheading of furniture, 160 yen, is out of all proportion with the\r\nexpenditures of A and C, 10 yen and 1 yen respectively. This\r\nis due to the fact that B had to provide a bride's chest for a\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nA balance sheet given me by a peasant proprietor in Aichi\r\n(5_tan_ of two-crop paddy and 5 _tan_ of upland) showed a balance\r\nin hand of 27 yen.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural expert said to me, \"The peasant proprietors\r\nare the backbone of the country, but the condition of the backbone\r\nis not good. The peasant proprietors can make ends meet\r\nonly by secondary employments.\" The expert showed me average\r\nfigures for 18 farmers for 1891, 1900 and 1909. The average\r\nland of these men was a little over a _chō_ of paddy and 5 _tan_ of\r\nupland and some woodland. They had spent 39, 63 and 86\r\nyen on artificial manures as against 100, 153 and 204 yen on\r\nfood. The balance at the end of the year for the three years\r\nrespectively was 27, 40 and 29 yen. \"The figures reflect the\r\ngeneral condition,\" I was told.\r\n\r\nINCOMES AND EXPENDITURES OF TENANTS.--I may also note the\r\ncircumstances of the largest and of the smallest tenant in an Aichi\r\nvillage I visited. The largest tenant family showed a balance in hand,\r\n93 yen; the smallest tenant, 23 yen.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of 16 tenants for 1891 showed an average sum of 3 yen in\r\nhand at the end of the year, for 1900 a loss of 5 yen and for 1909 a\r\ngain of 1 yen. These men had an average of 9 _tan_ of paddy and 2\r\n_tan_ of upland. The man who gave me the data said that in the\r\nnorth-east of Japan \"the condition of the tenants is miserable--eating\r\nalmost cattle food.\" The only bright spot for tenants was that, as\r\ncompared with peasant proprietors, they were free to change their\r\nholdings and even their business.\r\n\r\nINCOMES OF TENANTS AND PEASANT PROPRIETORS (SHIDZUOKA).--One tenant,\r\nwho pays 159 yen in rent and taxes, shows a total income of 374 yen\r\nand an expenditure of 538 yen, with a _net loss of 164 yen_. \"Farmers\r\nof this class,\" notes the local expert on the memorandum he gave me,\r\n\"are becoming poorer every year.\" This tenant spent 2 yen on medicine\r\nand 5 yen on tobacco. (\"Nothing else for enjoyment,\" pencils the\r\nexpert.) In addition to parents, a man, a woman and a girl of the\r\nfamily worked. Food cost 321 yen (cost of fish and meat, 4-1/2 yen)\r\nand clothing 34 yen.\r\n\r\nIn a \"model village,\" where \"the farmers are always diligent,\" a\r\nsmall tenant's income was 508 yen and expenditure 527 yen; _loss_, 19\r\n_yen_. Clothes cost 95 yen and food 190 yen. (Cost of fish and meat,\r\n4-3/4 yen.) There was an expenditure on medicine of 1-1/2 yen and on\r\ntobacco and _saké_ (\"only enjoyment\") 10 yen.\r\n\r\nTwenty per cent, of the farmers, I was told, \"lead a middle-class life\r\nand occupy a somewhat rational area of land.\" The budgets often of\r\nthese men, who own their own land, show a _balance of 85 yen_. \"If\r\nthey were tenants they would not be in such a good condition.\" \"We\r\nthink the farmer ought to have 2 _chō_.\"\r\n\r\nBUDGETS OF FARMERS ON THE LAND OF THE HOMMA CLAN, YAMAGATA (page\r\n186).--A tenant had 3 _chō_ of paddy and a small piece of vegetable\r\nland. There lived with him his wife, two sons and the widow and child\r\nof the eldest son. After paying his rent he had 30 _koku_ of rice\r\nleft. The cost of production and taxes, 100 yen or a little more, had\r\nto come out of that. This tenant had a debt of 250 yen.\r\n\r\nA sturdy wagoner with a sturdy horse lived with his wife and three\r\nchildren and his old mother. He hired 1 _chō_ for 28 _koku_ of rice\r\nand his crop was 40 _koku_. He spent 30 yen on manure and 4 yen went\r\nin taxes.\r\n\r\nA middle-grade farmer owned a house and a little more than 1 _chō_ and\r\nrented 3 _chō_ of paddy and a patch for vegetables. His rent was about\r\n38 _koku_. He spent 100 yen on manure and 128 yen for taxes, temple\r\ndues and regulation of the paddy. He employed at 2-1/2 _koku_ a man\r\nwho lived with the family, also temporary labour for 48 days. His crop\r\nmight be 100 _koku_ or more. He had no debt.\r\n\r\nA third man was above the middle grade of farmer. His taxes were 240\r\nyen and his manure bill 130 yen. His payment for paddy-field\r\nregulation, to continue for ten years, was 60 yen. He had three\r\nlabourers and he also hired extra labour for 100 days. He had three\r\nunmarried sons of 40, 29 and 25. There were 260 yen of pensions in\r\nrespect of the war service of one son and the death of another.\r\n\r\nINCOME OF PEASANT PROPRIETORS (HOKKAIDO).--The following statistics\r\nfor the whole of Hokkaido are based on the experience of peasant\r\nproprietors. The 2-1/2 _chō_ men are rice farmers--rice farming means\r\nfarming with rice as the principal crop. The 5-_chō_ men are engaged\r\nin mixed farming:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFarmer's|Income |  Income  | Total |  Cost of  |Cost of |Total |Balance.\r\n  Area  | from  |from Other|       |Cultivation|Living  |Outlay|\r\n        |Farming|   Work   |       |           |        |      |\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |  yen  |    yen   |  yen  |    yen    |  yen   | yen  | yen\r\n2-1/2   |       |          |       |           |        |      |\r\nchō     |  366  |     43   |  409  |    107    |  276   | 382  |  27\r\n        |       |          |       |           |        |      |\r\n5 chō   |  441  |     33   |  474  |    119    |  301   | 423  |  52\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that mixed farming is the more profitable.\r\n\r\nIncome of Tenants (Hokkaido).--Professor Takaoka was kind enough to\r\ngive me the following summaries of balance sheets of tenants of\r\ncollege lands in different parts of Hokkaido in 1915. (In all cases\r\nthe accounts have been debited with wages for the farmer's family.)\r\n\r\nFive _chō_. Income, 447 yen; _net return, 37 yen_. (Rye, wheat, oats,\r\ncorn, soy, potatoes, grass, flax, buckwheat and rape. One horse and a\r\nfew hens.)\r\n\r\nFive _chō_. Income, 763 yen; _net return, 58 yen_. (Rye, wheat, oats,\r\nrape, soy, potatoes, corn, grass, flax and onions. Three cows, one\r\nhorse.)\r\n\r\nTen _chō_. Income, 1,015 yen; _net return, 122 yen_. (Same crops with\r\ntwo cows and one horse and some hired labour.)\r\n\r\nFive _chō_ (peppermint on 3 _chō_). Income, 882 yen; _net return_, 93\r\n_yen_.\r\n\r\nThree _chō_. Income, 1,195 yen; _net return, 332 yen_. (Vegetable\r\nfarming. 206 yen paid for labour.)\r\n\r\nThirty _chō_. Income, 1,979 yen; _net return, 61 yen_. (Mixed farming;\r\n632 yen paid for labour.)\r\n\r\nModel _5-chō_ farm without rice. Made 604 yen, and 107 yen _net\r\nreturn_, farm capital being 1,487 yen.

More delicious rice could be got, I was\r\ntold, from well-fertilised barren land than from naturally fertile\r\nland. The first year the new paddy yielded per _tan_ an average of 1.2\r\n_koku_, the second 1.6, the third 2, and this fourth year the yield\r\nwould have been 2.3 had it not been for damage by storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAREAS AND CROPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF RICE [XV]. In 1919 there was\r\ngrown of paddy rice 2,984,750 _chō_ (2,729,639 ordinary, 255,111\r\nglutinous) and of upland rice 141,365 _chō_. Total, 3,126,115 _chō_.\r\nThe yield (husked, uncleaned) was of paddy 61,343,403 _koku_\r\n(ordinary, 56,438,005; glutinous, 4,905,398); of upland, 1,839,312.\r\nTotal, 63,182,715 _koku_; value, 2,352,145,519 yen.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the area is reputed to have been 1,940,000 _chō_ with a yield\r\nof 24,450,000 _koku_ and in 1882 2,580,000 _chō_ with a yield of\r\n30,692,000 _koku_. The average of the five years 1910-14 was 3,033,000\r\n_chō_ with a yield of 57,006,000 _koku_; of the five years 1915-19,\r\n3,081,867 _chō_ with a yield of 94,817,431 _koku_.\r\n\r\nIn a prefecture in south-western Japan I found that 2 _koku_ 5 _to_\r\n(or 2-1/2 _koku_, there being 10 _to_ in a _koku_) per _tan_ was\r\ncommon and that from 3 _koku_ to 3 _koku_ 5 _to_ was reached. \"A good\r\nyield for 1 _tan_,\" says an eminent authority, \"is 3 _koku_, or on the\r\nbest fields even 4 _koku_.\" The average yield in _koku_ per _tan_ for\r\nthe whole country has been (paddy-field rice only): 1882, 1.19;\r\n1894-8, 1.38; 1899-1903, 1.44; 1904-8, 1.57; 1909-13, 1.63; 1914-18,\r\n1.86; 1919, 1.99; 1920, 2.05 (ordinary, 2.06; glutinous, 1.92). Upland\r\nrice in 1920, 1.30 as against 1.02 in 1909. All these figures are for\r\nhusked, uncleaned rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY AND WHEAT CROPS [XVI]. The following table (average of five\r\nyears, 1913-17) shows the yields per _tan_ of the two sorts of barley\r\nand of wheat and the average yield all three together in comparison\r\nwith the rice yield (all quantities husked):\r\n\r\n                 _go_                          _go_\r\nBarley           1,672 | All three together    1,307\r\nNaked barley     1,172 | Rice                  1,808\r\nWheat            1,073 |\r\n\r\nNaked barley is grown as an upland crop, as are ordinary barley and\r\nwheat; but it is more largely grown as a second crop in paddies than\r\neither barley or wheat. The barleys are chiefly used for human food\r\nwith or without rice. Wheat is eaten in macaroni, sweetstuffs and\r\nbread. It is also used in considerable quantities in the manufacture\r\nof soy, the chief ingredient of which is beans. There was imported in\r\nthe year 1920 wheat to the value of 28-1/2 million yen, and flour to\r\nthe value of 3-1/4 million yen. Macaroni is largely made of buckwheat\r\nas well as of wheat. The other grain crop is millet, which is eaten by\r\nthe poorest farmers. In 1918, as against 60 million _koku_ of rice,\r\nthere were grown 5 million _koku_ of beans and peas. The crops of\r\nbarley were 17 million, of wheat 6 million, of millet 3-1/4 million,\r\nand of buckwheat 3/4 million. More than a million _kwan_ of sweet\r\npotatoes were produced and nearly half a million of \"Irish\" potatoes.\r\n(The figures for barley and wheat are for 1919.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST AND PRICE OF RICE [XVII]. The annual figures (from Aichi) for the\r\nyears 1894 to 1915 (page 384) show the cost of producing a _tan_ of\r\nrice, that is the summer crop. The amounts per _tan_ are calculated on\r\nthe basis of the expenses of a tenant who is cropping 8 _tan_. The\r\ntotals for the winter crop are also given. The figures which appear on\r\nthe opposite page were described to me by the farmer concerned as\r\n\"compiled on the basis of investigations by the chairman of the\r\nvillage agricultural association and by its managers and still further\r\nproved and quite trustworthy.\" It will be seen that the value of the\r\nwinter crop is low; a secondary employment is usually a better thing\r\nfor the farmer. In one or two places there is a sen or so difference\r\nin the additions which may have been made by the transcriber from the\r\nJapanese original. The difference in amounts of rent is due to\r\ndifference in fields rented and also to reduction allowed owing to bad\r\ncrops. The difference in the income from crops is usually due to\r\ndestruction by hail or wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST AND PRICE OF RICE (see page 383)\r\n\r\n|Year\r\n|      |Yield in\r\n|      |_koku_\r\n|      |      |Reserved for Rent\r\n|      |      |and Seeds (_koku_)\r\n|      |      |      |Market Price per\r\n|      |      |      |_koku_ (yen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |Gross Income including\r\n|      |      |      |       |Straw and Chaff,\r\n|      |      |      |       |not usually sold (yen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |Manures (yen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |Taxes and Amortisation\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |of Implements (sen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |Total Outlay (yen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |Net Income from Summer\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |Crop of Rice (yen)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |Days of Labour on\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |Summer Crop of Rice\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |      |Net Income from\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |      |Winter Crop (?Barley)\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |      |       |Total Net\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |      |       |Income from\r\n|      |      |      |       |       |     |    |      |       |      |       |both Crops.\r\n|------|------|------|-------|-------|-----|----|------|-------|------|-------|-------|\r\n| 1894 | 2.23 | 1.05 |  7.66 |  9.81 | 2   | 21 | 2.21 |  7.60 |  2.5 |  2.51 | 10.11 |\r\n| 1895 | 2.13 | 1.05 |  8.09 |  8.71 | 2   | 21 | 2.26 |  6.45 | 21.5 |  2.48 |  8.92 |\r\n| 1896 | 1.53 |  .80 |  8.67 |  6.89 | 2.4 | 22 | 2.58 |  4.31 | 21.5 |  3.38 |  7.69 |\r\n| 1897 | 1.88 | 1.05 | 11.53 | 10.63 | 2.9 | 23 | 3.13 |  7.50 | 21.5 |  5.22 | 12.72 |\r\n| 1898 | 2.39 | 1.05 | 14.62 | 21.13 | 3.2 | 25 | 3.40 | 17.73 | 21.5 |  5.50 | 23.23 |\r\n| 1899 | 1.75 |  .88 | 12.05 | 11.48 | 3.8 | 30 | 4.11 |  7.37 | 21   |  2.22 |  9.99 |\r\n| 1900 | 2.14 | 1.05 | 11.11 | 13.24 | 4.1 | 31 | 4.40 |  8.84 | 21   |  4.22 | 13.06 |\r\n| 1901 | 2.10 | 1.05 | 10.53 | 12.06 | 4   | 32 | 4.35 |  7.71 | 21   |  3.87 | 11.58 |\r\n| 1902 | 1.86 |  .99 | 12.99 | 12.40 | 3.1 | 38 | 3.51 |  8.89 | 21   |  4.11 | 13    |\r\n| 1903 | 2.06 | 1.04 | 12.50 | 13.85 | 3.4 | 49 | 3.79 | 10.05 | 21   |  6    | 16.85 |\r\n| 1904 | 2.24 | 1.03 | 12.20 | 16    | 2.6 | 53 | 3.11 |  9.89 | 21   |  6.06 | 15.95 |\r\n| 1905 | 1.77 |  .99 | 13.42 | 11.60 | 2.1 | 46 | 2.55 |  9.05 | 21   |  6.67 | 15.71 |\r\n| 1906 | 1.96 | 1.05 | 15.15 | 15 09 | 4   | 56 | 4.61 | 10.49 | 21   |  5.79 | 16.27 |\r\n| 1907 | 1.98 | 1.14 | 16.39 | 16.69 | 4.4 | 42 | 4.83 | 11.84 | 21   |  8.60 | 20.43 |\r\n| 1908 | 2.21 | 1.14 | 14.29 | 16.80 | 5.1 | 42 | 5.54 | 11.26 | 21   | 10.79 | 22.05 |\r\n| 1909 | 2.27 | 1.14 | 11.63 | 14.39 | 3.7 | 99 | 4.64 |  9.75 | 21   | 11.49 | 21.24 |\r\n| 1910 | 2.02 | 1.14 | 14.09 | 13.37 | 4.5 | 80 | 5.27 |  8.51 | 21   | 12.41 | 20.91 |\r\n| 1911 | 2.22 | 1.14 | 16.67 | 19.72 | 4.4 | 78 | 5.13 | 14.59 | 21   | 13.49 | 28.08 |\r\n| 1912 | 2.02 |  .90 | 21.74 | 26.48 | 5.9 | 75 | 6.60 | 19.88 | 21.5 |  3.73 | 23.6  |\r\n| 1913 | 2.31 | 1.14 | 20.83 | 24.67 | 6.5 | 79 | 7.30 | 17.37 | 21.5 | 12.62 | 30    |\r\n| 1914 | 2.48 | 1.14 | 12.50 | 18.29 | 5.8 | 78 | 6.53 | 11.75 | 21.5 | 11.54 | 23.30 |\r\n| 1915 | 2.36 | 1.20 | 11.77 | 14.91 | 5.8 | 82 | 6.67 |  8.24 | 21.5 |  9.67 | 18.91 |\r\n\r\nThis table may be supplemented by the following prices for\r\n(unpolished) rice in Tokyo: 1916, 13 yen 76 sen; 1917, 19 yen 84 sen;\r\n1918, 32 yen 75 sen; 1919, 45 yen 99 sen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1921 the League for the Prevention of Sales of Rice\r\nat a Sacrifice proposed that rice should not be sold under 35 yen per\r\n_koku_. The price passed the figure of 35 yen in July 1918. At the\r\ntime the League's proposals were made the Ministry of Agriculture was\r\nquoted as stating that the cost of producing rice \"is now 40 yen per\r\n_koku_.\" The accuracy of the figures on which the Ministry's estimates\r\nare made is frequently called in question.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED AREA IN JAPAN AND GREAT BRITAIN [XVIII]. In 1919 there were\r\nin Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the\r\nChannel Islands) 15,808,000 acres of arable, 15,910,000 of pasture and\r\n13,647,000 of grazing, or a total of 45,365,000 acres out of a total\r\narea of 56,990,000 acres. In Japan there were 15,044,202 acres of\r\npaddy and of cultivated upland, 46,958,000 acres of forest and\r\n8,773,000 acres of waste; total 70,775,000, out of 90,880,000 acres.\r\nThe area of the United Kingdom without Ireland is 56,990,080 acres;\r\nthat of Japan Proper, 75,988,378 acres. The population of the United\r\nKingdom without Ireland (in 1911) was 41,126,000, and of Japan Proper\r\n(in 1911) 51,435,000. (See also Appendix XXX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN LABOUR _v_.

The \"average\r\nyear's work of the ordinary adult farmer\" was put at 200 days.

The value of the manure used in Japan in a year has been\r\nestimated at about 220 million yen, but for the three years ending\r\n1916 it averaged 241 millions, as follows:\r\n\r\nProduced or obtained by the Farmer  | Purchased\r\n                        yen         |                         yen\r\nCompost              63,500,000     | Bean cake            32,000,000\r\nHuman waste          54,000,000     | Mixed                17,000,000\r\nGreen manure          9,600,000     | Miscellaneous        16,000,000\r\nRice chaff            5,000,000     | Sulphate of ammonia  15,000,000\r\n                                    | Superphosphate       12,000,000\r\n                                    | Fish waste           12,000,000\r\n\r\nDr. Sato puts the artificial manure used per _tan_ at a sixth of that\r\nof Belgium and a quarter of that of Great Britain and Germany. See\r\nalso Appendix IV. An agricultural expert once said to me, \"Japanese\r\nfarmer he keep five head of stock, his own family.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWING OF RICE [XXI]. A common seeding time is the eighty-eighth day\r\nof the year according to the old calendar, say May 1 or 2.\r\nTransplanting is very usual at the end of May or early in June. In\r\nKagawa, Shikoku, I found that rice was sown at the beginning of May or\r\neven at the end of April, the transplanting being done in mid-June.\r\nThe harvest was obtained 10 per cent. about September 10th, 30 per\r\ncent. in October and 60 per cent. about the beginning of November. The\r\nwinter crop of naked barley was sown in the first quarter of December\r\nand was harvested late in May or early in June, so there was just time\r\nfor the rice planting in mid-June.\r\n\r\nIn Kochi the first crop is sown about March 15, the seedlings are put\r\nout in mid-May and the harvest is ready about August 10. The second\r\ncrop, which has been sown in June, is ready with its seedlings from\r\nAugust 13 to August 15, and the harvest arrives about November 1 and\r\n2. The first crop may yield about 3 _koku_, the second 1-1/2 _koku_.\r\n\r\nA good deal depends in raising a big crop on a good seed bed. This is\r\ngot by reducing the quantity of seed used and by applying manure\r\nwisely. Whereas formerly as much as from 5 to 7 _go_ of seed was sown\r\nper _tsubo_, the biggest crops are now got from 1 _go_.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese names of the most widely grown varieties are Shinriki,\r\nAikoku, Omachi, Chikusei and Sekitori. At an experiment station I\r\ncopied the names of the varieties on exhibition there: Banzai,\r\nPatriotism, Japanese Embroidery, Good-looking, Early Power of God,\r\nBamboo, Small Embroidery, Power of God, Mutual Virtue, Yellow Bamboo,\r\nLate White, Power of God (glutinous), Silver Rice Cake and Eternal\r\nRice Field.\r\n\r\nThere are several thousand _chō_ in the vicinity of Tokyo where, owing\r\nto the low temperature of the marshy soil, the seed is sown direct in\r\nthe paddies, not broadcast but at regular intervals and in thrice or\r\nfour times the normal quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF PLANTING [XXII]. I have been told that an adult who has the\r\nseedlings brought to his or her hand can stick in a thousand an hour.\r\nThe early varieties may be set in clumps of seven or eight plants;\r\nmiddle-growth sorts may contain from five to six; the latest kind may\r\ninclude only three or four. The number of clumps planted may be 42 per\r\n_tsubo_, which, as a _tsubo_ is nearly four square yards, is about ten\r\nper square yard. The clumps are put in their places by being pushed\r\ninto the mud. A straight line is kept by means of a rope. The success\r\nof the crop depends in no small degree on skilful planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH RICE DOES A JAPANESE EAT? [XXIII]. The daily consumption of\r\nrice per head, counting young and old, is nearly 3 _go_. (A _go_ is\r\nroughly a third of a pint.) A sturdy labourer will consume at least 5\r\n_go_ in a day, and sometimes 7 or even 10 _go_. The allowance for\r\nsoldiers is 6 _go_. These quantities represent the rice uncooked. In\r\nrecent years more and more rice has been eaten by those who formerly\r\nate barley or mainly barley. And some who once ate a good deal of\r\nmillet and _hiye_ are now eating a certain amount of rice. The\r\naverage annual consumption per head of the Japanese population (Korea\r\nand Formosa excluded from the calculation) was: 1888-93, 948 _go_;\r\n1908-13, 1,037 _go_; 1913-18, 1,050 _go_. The averages of 25 years\r\n(1888-1912) were: production, 42,756,584 _koku_; consumption,\r\n44,410,725 _koku_; deficit, 1,984,970 _koku_; population, 45,140,094;\r\nper head, 0.980 _koku_. In 1921 the Department of Agriculture,\r\nestimating a population of 55,960,000 (see Appendix XXX) and an annual\r\nconsumption per head of 1.1 _koku_ per year, put the national\r\nconsumption for a year at about 61,550,000 _koku_. See also Appendix\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTED AND EXPORTED RICE [XXIV]. \"Good rice\" is imported from Korea\r\nand Formosa. The objection is to \"Rangoon\" rice. But most of the\r\nimported rice does not come from Rangoon but from Saigon. The figures\r\nfor 1919 were in yen: China, 283,011; British India, 1,012,979;\r\nKwantung, 15,053,977; Siam, 29,367,430; French Indo-China,\r\n116,313,525; other countries, 39,918; total, 162,070,840. The exports\r\nin 1919 were in yen: China, 1,354; Australia, 6,570; Asiatic Russia,\r\n165,463; Kwantung, 213,633; British America, 356,600; United States,\r\n476,756; Hawaii, 3,046,598; other countries, 60,707--all obviously in\r\nthe main for Japanese consumption. The total imports and exports were\r\nin _koku_ and yen over a period of years:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n       |       Imports         |       Exports         |\r\n  Year |-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\r\n       |  _Koku_   |Value (yen)|  _Koku_   |Value (yen)|\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1909 | 1,325,243 | 13,585,817|  422,513  | 5,867,290 |\r\n  1910 |   918,627 |  8,644,439|  429,251  | 5,900,477 |\r\n  1911 | 1,719,566 | 11,721,085|  216,198  | 3,940,541 |\r\n  1912 | 2,234,437 | 30,193,481|  208,423  | 4,367,824 |\r\n  1913 | 3,637,269 | 48,472,304|  204,002  | 4,372,979 |\r\n  1914 | 2,022,644 | 24,823,933|  260,738  | 4,974,108 |\r\n  1915 |   457,606 |  4,886,125|  662,629  | 9,676,969 |\r\n  1916 |   309,158 |  3,087,616|  686,479  |11,197,356 |\r\n  1917 |   564,376 |  6,513,373|  769,129  |14,662,546 |\r\n  1918 | 4,647,168 | 89,755,678|  264,565  | 8,321,965 |\r\n  1919 | 4,642,382 |162,070,840|   95,219  | 4,327,690 |\r\n  1920 |   471,083 | 18,059,194|  116,249  | 5,897,675 |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five years' average (1888-1912) of excess of import\r\nover export was 1,339,493 _koku_.

The degree to which the increase in production will\r\nbe maintained is of course a matter for discussion. As far as rice is\r\nconcerned, it must be borne in mind that there is an increasing\r\nconsumption per head.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' DIET [XXVI]. It is officially stated in 1921 that \"the common\r\nfarm diet consists of a mixture of cooked rice and barley as the\r\nprincipal food with vegetables and occasionally fish.\" The barley is\r\nwhat is known as naked barley. Ordinary barley is eaten in northern\r\nJapan, but two-thirds of the barley eaten elsewhere is the wheat-like\r\nnaked barley, which cannot be grown in Fukushima and the north. The\r\nhusking of ordinary barley is hard work. The young men do it during\r\nthe night when it is cool. They keep on until cock-crow. Their songs\r\nand the sound of their mallets make a memorable impression as one\r\npasses through a village on a moonlight night. Another substitute for\r\nrice beyond millet is _hiye_ (panic grass). In the south it is\r\nregarded as a weed of the paddies, but in the north many _tan_ are\r\nplanted with this heavy-yielding small grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION [XXVII]. Before 1906 national taxation was 2.5 per cent. of\r\nthe legal price of land. In 1900 it was 3.3 per cent., in 1904 5.5 per\r\ncent., in 1911 4.7 per cent, and in 1915 4.5 per cent. But local\r\ntaxation increased in greater proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAVOUR OF RICE AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS [XXVIII]. Japanese rice has a\r\nfatty flavour which the people of Japan like. Therefore the native\r\nrice commands a higher price in Japan than Chinese or Indian rice.\r\nWith the exception of a small quantity exported to Japanese abroad,\r\nJapanese rice is consumed in Japan. The supply of it and the demand\r\nfor it are exclusively a Japanese affair. Naturally, when the crop\r\nfails the price soars, and when there is a superabundant harvest the\r\nprice comes down to the level of foreign rice. Here is the secret of\r\nthe enormous fluctuations in the price of Japanese rice with which\r\nthe authorities have so often endeavoured to cope.\r\n\r\nThe Government granary plan is the third big effort of authority to\r\nmanage rice prices. The Okuma Government, under the administration of\r\nwhich rice went down to 14 yen per _koku_, had a Commission to raise\r\nprices. The Terauchi Ministry, at a time when prices rose, touching 55\r\nyen, had a Commission to bring prices down.\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA AND CLIMATE [XXIX]. Japan Proper comprises a main island, three\r\nother large islands in sight of the main island, and\r\narchipelagos--4,000 islets have been counted. The main island, Honshu,\r\nwith Shikoku behind it, lies off the coast of Korea; the next largest\r\nand northernmost island, Hokkaido, off the coast of Siberia, and the\r\nremaining sizeable island and the southernmost, Kyushu, off the coast\r\nof China over against the mouth of the Yangtse. The area of this\r\nterritory, that is of Japan before the acquirement of Formosa, Korea,\r\nsouthern Saghalien and part of Manchuria, is about 142,000 square\r\nmiles in area, which is that of Great Britain in possession not of one\r\nWales but of four, or nearly 1 per cent. of the area of Asia. But\r\nthere are several million more people in Japan than there are\r\ninhabitants of Great Britain and thrice as many as there are Britons\r\nin Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India. (See also\r\nAppendix XXX.) Japan, which lies between the latitudes of Cairo and\r\nthe Crimea, may be said to consist of mountains, of which fifty are\r\nactive volcanoes, with some land, either hilly or boggy, at the foot\r\nof them. It is nowhere more than 200 miles across and in one place is\r\nonly 50. A note on the ocean currents which exercise an influence on\r\nagriculture will be found on page 195. The protection afforded to the\r\neastern prefectures by mountain ranges is obvious. Generally the\r\nsummer temperature of Japan is higher and the winter temperature is\r\nlower than is recorded in Europe and America within the same\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n\"The mild climate and abundant rainfall,\" says the Department of\r\nAgriculture, \"stimulate a luxuriant forest development throughout the\r\ncountry which in turn provides ample fountain heads for rivers. The\r\nrivers and streams run in all directions, affording opportunity for\r\nirrigation all over the country. The insular position of the country\r\nrenders its humidity high and its rainfall abundant when compared with\r\nContinental countries. The rainy season prevails during the months of\r\nJune and July, making this season risky for the harvest of wheat and\r\nbarley; on the other hand it affords a beneficent irrigation supply to\r\npaddy-grown rice, which is the most important crop. The characteristic\r\nfeature of the climate in the greater part of the islands is the\r\nfrequency of storms in the months of August and September. As the\r\nflowers of the rice plant commence to bloom during the same period,\r\nthese late summer storms cause much damage.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather in Tokyo in 1918 was as follows:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            |Jan.|Feb.|Mar.|Apl.| May|June|July|Aug.|Sept.|Oct.|Nov.|Dec.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRain and    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |\r\n  snow (mm.)|  10|  65| 163| 108| 123| 149|  82|  78|  202| 135| 142| 80\r\nTemp.

The population of\r\nthe Empire according to the 1920 census was 77,005,510, which included\r\nKorea, 17,284,207; Formosa, 3,654,398; Saghalien, 105,765; and South\r\nManchuria (that is, the Kwantung Peninsula), 80,000. In Old Japan\r\n(Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu with the near islands, and Loo-choos and\r\nBonins) there were 53,602,043, and in Hokkaido (including Kuriles)\r\n2,359,097.\r\n\r\nTokyo is the largest city, 2,173,000, followed by Osaka, 1,252,000.\r\nKobe and Kyoto have a little more than half a million; Nagoya and\r\nYokohama four hundred thousand apiece. Ten other cities have a hundred\r\nthousand odd.\r\n\r\nIn the following table the populations and areas of Japan, Great\r\nBritain and the United States are compared:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      Country                   |  Area   | Population    |  Population\r\n                                |         |               | per sq. mile\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nJapan (excluding Korea, Formosa |         |               |\r\n  and Saghalien)                | 142,000 | 55,961,140    |     394\r\n                                |         |   (1920)      |\r\nBritish Isles                   | 121,636 | 47,306,664[*] |     388\r\n                                |         |   (1921)      |\r\nUnited States (excluding Alaska |         |               |\r\n  and oversea possessions)      |3,000,000| 105,683,108   |      35\r\n                                |         |   (1920)      |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Ireland taken at 1911 census figures.\r\n\r\nJapan's 394 per square mile is lowered by the population of Hokkaido\r\n(2,359,097), which is only 66 per square mile. The population of the\r\nthree chief Japanese islands is: Honshu, the mainland (41,806,930),\r\n471; Shikoku (3,066,890), 423; and Kyushu (8,729,088), 511. (These\r\nfigures are for 1920.) \"As regards density per square kilometre,\"\r\nwrites an official of the Imperial Bureau of Statistics in the _Japan\r\nYear-book_, with the figures antecedent to the 1920 census before him,\r\n\"it is calculated at 140 for Japan and this compares as follows with\r\nBelgium (1910) 252, England and Wales (1911) 239, Holland (1909) 171,\r\nItaly (1911) 121, Germany (1910) 120 and France 44. When comparison is\r\nmade on the basis of habitable area Japan may be considered to surpass\r\nall as to density, for while in Japan it constitutes only 19 per cent,\r\nof the total area, the ratio is as high as 74 for Belgium, 73 for\r\nEngland and Wales, 67 for Holland, 76 for Italy, 65 for Germany and 70\r\nfor France.\" The Professor of Agricultural Science at Tokyo University\r\nsays: \"The area under cultivation, even in the densely populated\r\nparts, is comparatively smaller than in any other country.\"\r\n\r\nIn a statement issued in 1921 the Department of Agriculture reckoned\r\nthe population at 145 per square kilometre and recorded the mean rate\r\nof increase \"in recent years\" as 12.06 per 1,000. It stated that the\r\ndensity of the rural population was 44 per square kilometre or 9.42\r\nper hectare of arable, in other words that the density \"is higher\r\nthan that of France, Belgium, Switzerland and some other countries\r\nwhere the agriculture is marked by fairly intensive methods.\" Mr.\r\nNikaido, of the Bureau of Statistics, writes in the _Japan Year-book_\r\nthat the annual increase of Japan's population was 14.78 per 1,000 for\r\n1909-13 and 12.06 for 1914-18, \"a rate greater than in any civilised\r\ncountry, with the exception of Germany and Rumania in the pre-War\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe birth rate is high, but so is the mortality. The death rate of\r\nminors is thrice that of Germany and Great Britain. Here the\r\nincreasing industrialisation of the country is no doubt playing its\r\npart. The ratio of still births has steadily risen since the eighties.\r\nThe ratio of births, other than still births, per 1,000 of population,\r\nwhich in 1889-93 was 28.6, increased by 1909-13 to 33.7; but the death\r\nrate fell only from 21.1 to 20.6. The ratio of unmarried, 63.22 in\r\n1893, was 66.22 in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe following figures for Japan Proper are printed by the _Financial\r\nand Economic Annual_, issued by the Department of Finance:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nYear. | Total.     |Annual Increase |Average Increase per\r\n      |            |of Population.  |1,000 Inhabitants.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n 1910 | 50,716,600 |  --            | 14.09}\r\n 1911 | 51,435,400 |718,800         | 14.17}\r\n 1912 | 52,167,000 |731,600         | 14.22}  14.21\r\n 1913 | 52,911,800 |744,800         | 14.28}\r\n 1914 | 53,668,600 |756,800         | 14.30}\r\n      |            |                |\r\n 1915 | 54,448,200 |779,600         | 14.53}\r\n 1916 | 55,235,000 |786,800         | 14.45}\r\n 1917 | 56,035,100 |800,100         | 14.49}  14.50\r\n 1918 | 56,851,300 |816,200         | 14.57}\r\n 1919 | 57,673,938 |822,638         | 14.47}\r\n 1920 | 55,961,140 |  --            |  --\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that for the year 1920 there was a big drop. The\r\npopulation of 55,961,140 for the year 1920 is the actual population as\r\nreturned by the census; the figures of the preceding years are\r\n\"based,\" it is explained to me, \"on the local registrars' entries. The\r\nnational census has demonstrated that the figures were larger than the\r\nactual number of inhabitants, the discrepancies being partly due to\r\nerroneous and duplicate registration and partly to the exodus of\r\npersons to the colonies or foreign countries whilst retaining their\r\nlegal domiciles at home. But the table serves to show the rate of\r\nincrease.\" A million and three-quarters is a substantial figure,\r\nhowever, to account for in this way. It would seem reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the increased cost of living, marriage at a later age\r\nthan formerly and increased mortality due directly or indirectly to\r\nthe factory system have arrested the rate of increase of the\r\npopulation in recent years. For trustworthy figures of the Japanese\r\npopulation we must await the next census and compare its figures with\r\nthose of the 1920 census, the first to be taken scientifically.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of Japan is uninhabitable. Of how much of the\r\nBritish Isles can this be said? The fact that there are in Japan fifty\r\nmore or less active volcanoes, about a thousand hot springs and two\r\ndozen mountains between 12,000 and 8,000 ft. high speaks for itself.\r\nBen Nevis is only 4,400, Snowdon only 3,500 ft.\r\n\r\nThe population of Korea in 1920 (17,284,207) was 239 per square mile.\r\nAccording to _Whitaker_ for 1921 the population of Manchuria (11\r\nmillions) is 30 per square mile, and of Mongolia (3 millions) 2.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FARMS DECREASING [XXXI].\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nYear |Below 5 |Over 5 |Over 5 |Over 2 |Over 3 |Over 5\r\n     |_tan_   |_tan_  |_chō_  |_chō_  |_chō_  |_chō_\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n1908 |37.28   |32.61  |19.51  |6.44   |3.01   |1.15\r\n1912 |37.14   |33.25  |19.61  |5.96   |2.83   |1.21\r\n1918 |35.54   |33.30  |20.70  |6.33   |2.82   |1.31\r\n1919 |35.36   |33.18  |20.68  |6.21   |2.83   |1.74\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSee also Appendix XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTS [XXXII]. The following figures for 1918 show, in thousand\r\n_chō_, the ownership of forests (bared tracts in brackets): Crown,\r\n1,303 (89); State, 7,288 (392); prefectures, cities, towns and\r\nvillages, 2,894 (1,383); temples and shrines, 111 (15); 7,186 (1,630);\r\ntotal, 18,782 (3,509). The largest yield is from sugi (cryptomeria),\r\npine and _hinoki_ (_Charmae-cyparis obtusa_).\r\n\r\n\r\nARMAMENTS [XXXIII]. 1,505 million yen of the national debt is for\r\narmaments and military purposes against 923 million yen for\r\nreproductive undertakings (railways, harbours, drainage, roads,\r\nsteelworks, mining, telephones, etc.), 143 million for exploitation of\r\nFormosa, Korea and Saghalien, 123 million for financial adjustment\r\nand 98 million for feudal pensions and feudal debt. Of the expenditure\r\nfor 1920-1, 846 million, some 395 million were for the army and navy.\r\nDuring a period of 130 years the United States Government has spent\r\nnearly four-fifths of its revenue on war or objects related to war.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDOWNING AND FARMING [XXXIV]. Before the Restoration the farmers\r\nwere the tenants of the daimyos' vassals, the samurai, or of the\r\ndaimyos direct. When the daimyos gave up their lands the Crown made\r\nthe farmers the owners of the land they occupied. Its legal value was\r\nassessed and the national land tax was fixed at 3 per cent, and the\r\nlocal tax at 1 per cent. Various adjustments have since taken place.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Constitutional Labour Party has insisted in a\r\ncommunication to the International Labour Conference at Geneva that\r\nJapanese tenant farmers are not properly called farmers but that they\r\nare \"labourers pure and simple.\" See Appendix LXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE RAILWAYS [XXXV]. The railways, which were nationalised in 1907,\r\nextended in 1919 to 6,000 miles. There were also nearly 2,000 miles of\r\nlight railways (in addition to 1,368 of electric street cars). Most of\r\nthe lines are single track. The gauge is 3 ft. 6 in. The Government\r\nhas proposed gradually to electrify the whole system.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLEGITIMACY [XXXVI]. In Japan illegitimacy is a question not of\r\nmorals but of law. That is to say, it is a question of registration.\r\nIf a husband omits to register his marriage he is not legally married.\r\nThus it is possible for there to be born to a married pair a child\r\nwhich is technically illegitimate. If the child should die at an early\r\nage it is equally possible for it to appear on the official records as\r\nillegitimate. A birth must be registered within a fortnight. It may be\r\nthought perhaps that it is practicable for the father to register his\r\nmarriage after the birth of the child and within the time allowed for\r\nregistration. It is possible but it is not always easy. An application\r\nfor the registration of the marriage of a man under twenty-five must\r\nbear the signature of his parents and the signature of two persons who\r\ntestify that the required consent has been regularly obtained. In the\r\nevent of a man's father having \"retired,\" the signature of the head of\r\nthe family must be secured. If a man is over twenty-five, then the\r\nsignatures of his parents or of any two relatives will suffice. Now\r\nsuppose that a man is living at a distance from his birthplace or\r\nsuppose that the head of his family is travelling. Plainly, there may\r\nbe a difficulty in securing a certificate in time. Therefore, because,\r\nas has been explained, no moral obloquy attaches to unregistered\r\nmarriage or to unregistered or legally illegitimate children,\r\nregistration is often put off. When a man removes from one place to\r\nanother and thereupon registers, it may be that his marriage and his\r\nchildren may be illegitimate in one place and legitimate in another.\r\nThere is a difference between actual and legal domicile. A man may\r\nhave his domicile in Tokyo but his citizen rights in his native\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAKÉ AND BEER [XXXVII]. Saké is sold in 1 or 2 _go_ bottles at from 10\r\nto 25 sen for 2 _go_. As it is cheaper to buy the liquor unbottled\r\nmost people have it brought home in the original brewery tub. There\r\nare five sorts of _saké_: _seishu_ (refined), _dakushu_ (unrefined or\r\nmuddy), _shirozake_ (white _saké_), _mirin_ (sweet _saké_) and\r\n_shōchū_ (distilled _saké_). _Saké_ may contain from 10 to 14 per\r\ncent. of alcohol; _shōchū_ is stronger; _mirin_ has been described as\r\na liqueur. Japanese beers contain from 1 to 2 per cent. less alcohol\r\nthan English beers and only about a quarter of the alcohol in _saké_.\r\nMore than four-fifths of it is sold in bottles. Beer is replacing\r\n_saké_ to some extent, but owing to the increase in the population of\r\nJapan the total consumption of _saké_ (about 4,000,000 _koku_) remains\r\npractically the same. In 1919 beer and _saké_ were exported to the\r\nvalue of 7,200,000 and 4,500,000 yen respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL PRODUCTION [XXXVIII]. In 1919 the production was as follows:\r\ngold, 1,938,711 _momme_, value 9,681,494 yen; silver, 42,822,160\r\n_momme_, value 11,131,861 yen; copper, 130,737,861 _kin_, value\r\n67,581,475 yen; iron, steel and iron pyrites, 169,545,050 _kwan_, the\r\nvalue of the steel being 72,666,867 yen; coal, 31,271,093 metric tons,\r\nvalue 442,540,941 yen.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN AS SILK PRODUCER [XXXIX], In exportation of silk, Japan, which\r\nin 1919 had under sericulture 8.6 of her total cultivated area and\r\n17.1 per cent, of her upland, passed Italy in 1901 and China in 1910.\r\nHer exportation is now twice that of China. In production her total is\r\nthrice that of Italy. France is a long way behind Italy. The\r\nproduction of China is an unknown quantity.\r\n\r\nAs to the advantages and drawbacks of Japan for sericulture the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture wrote in 1921: \"Japan is not favourably\r\nplaced, inasmuch as atmospheric changes are often very violent, and\r\nthe air becomes damp in the silk-culture seasons. This is especially\r\nthe case in the season of spring silkworms, for the cold is severe at\r\nthe beginning and the air becomes excessively damp as the rainy season\r\nsets in. The intense heat in July and August, too, is very trying for\r\nthe summer and autumn breeds. Compared with France and Italy, Japan\r\nseems to be heavily handicapped, but the abundance of mulberry leaves\r\nall over the land and the comparatively rich margin of spare labour\r\namong the farmers have proved great advantages.\"\r\n\r\nThe length of the sericultural season ranges from 54 days in spring to\r\n31 or 32 days in autumn, but there are variations according to\r\nweather, methods and seed. The season begins with the incubation\r\nperiod. Then follows the rearing. Last is the period in which the\r\ncaterpillars mount the little straw stacks provided for them in order\r\nthat they may wind themselves into cocoons. I do not enter into the\r\ntechnics of the retardation and stimulation of seed in order to delay\r\nor to hasten the hatch according to the movements of the market.\r\nHydrochloric and sulphuric-acid baths and electricity are used as\r\nstimulants; storage in \"wind holes\" is practised to defer hatching.\r\n\r\nCocoons are reckoned both by the _kwan_ of 8-1/4 lbs. and by the\r\n_koku_ of approximately 5 bushels. The cocoon production in 1918\r\nworked out at about 16-1/2 bushels per acre of mulberry or 18 bushels\r\nper family engaged in sericulture. About 34 million bushels of cocoons\r\nare produced. In 1919 the production was 270,800,000 kilos. The\r\naverage production of a _tambu_ of mulberry field was 1.356 _koku_. In\r\n1919 a _koku_ was worth on the average 106.81 yen (including double\r\nand waste cocoons). The cost of producing cocoons rose from 4.105 yen\r\nper _kwamme_ in 1916 to 11.284 yen in 1920. The daily wages of\r\nlabourers employed by the farmers rose from 62 sen for men and 47 sen\r\nfor women in 1910 to 1 yen 93 sen for men and 1 yen 44 sen for women\r\nin 1920. With the slump, the price of cocoons fell below the cost of\r\nproduction and there was trouble in several districts when wages were\r\ndue. The labourers engaged for the silk seasons of 1916 numbered\r\n341,577, of whom 30,000 came from other than their employers'\r\nprefectures. These people migrate from the early to the late districts\r\nand so manage to provide themselves with work during a considerable\r\nperiod. As many as 5-1/2 per cent, of the persons engaged in the\r\nindustry are labourers. Many employment agencies are engaged in\r\nsupplying labour.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the labour of 19.8 persons (200 per\r\nhectare) is needed for a _tambu_ of mulberry field. The silkworms\r\nhatched from a card of eggs (laid by 100 moths) are supposed to call\r\nfor the labour of 49.2 persons (1,456 per kilo, 2.204 lbs.)\r\n\r\nThe production of _cocoons_ rose from 0.866 _koku_ per card in 1914 to\r\n1.105 in 1918, or from 4,412,000 to 6,832,000.\r\n\r\nMore than three-quarters of the raw silk produced used to be exported.\r\nNow, with the increase of factories in Japan (the figures are for\r\n1918), only 67 per cent, goes abroad, the bulk of it to the United\r\nStates, which obtained from Japan, in 1917-18, 75 per cent., and in\r\n1919, it has been stated, 90 per cent, of its total supply. About 28\r\nper cent, of the world's consumption is supplied by Japan. Whereas in\r\n1915 the output of raw silk was 5,460,000 _kwan_ valued at 217,746,000\r\nyen, it was in 1918 7,891,000 _kwan_ valued at 546,543,000 yen. While\r\nin 1915-16 the percentage of Japanese exporters to foreign exporters\r\nwas 64-4, it had risen in 1919-20 to 77.5. Against 450 _chō_ of\r\nmulberries in 1914 there were in 1918 508,993 _chō_. The total export\r\nof raw silk and silk textiles to all countries in 1920 was 382 and 158\r\nmillion yen respectively. In 1919, 96 per cent. of the raw silk Japan\r\nexported went to the United States and 46 out of 101 million yens'\r\nworth of exported silk textiles (habutal). Japan's whole trade with\r\nthe United States is worth 880 million yen a year. But the proportion\r\nof basins in the factories steadily increases. There are nearly five\r\nthousand factories, big and little. A well-informed correspondent\r\nwrites to me: \"You know of course of the big organisation subsidised\r\nby the Government to control prices and not to make too much silk. The\r\ntruth is the silk interest became too powerful and the Government is\r\nnot a free agent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS [XL]. Phthisis and tuberculosis sweep off 22 per cent,\r\nand bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs 18 per cent., or together\r\nmore than a third of the population. See also Appendix LXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN WORKERS [XLI]. In addition to women and girls working in\r\nagriculture, in the mines, in the factories and & trades there are\r\nsaid to be 1,200,000 in business and the public services. Teachers\r\nnumber about 52,000, nurses 33,000, midwives 28,000 and doctors 700.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTORY FOOD AND \"DEFIANCE OF HYGIENIC RULES\" [XLII]. Dr. Kuwata says\r\nin the _Japan Year-book_ (1920-1) that \"in cotton mills where\r\nmachinery is run day and night it is not uncommon when business is\r\nbrisk to put operatives to 18 hours' work. In such cases holidays are\r\ngiven only fortnightly or are entirely withheld. The silk factories in\r\nNaganoken generally put their operatives to 14 or 16 hours' work and\r\nin only a small portion are the hours 13.\"\r\n\r\nSummarising a report of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, he\r\nsays of the factory workers: \"The bulk of workers are female and are\r\nchiefly fed with boiled rice in 43 per cent. of the factories. In\r\nother factories the staple food is poor, the rice being mixed with\r\ncheaper barley, millet or sweet potato in the proportion of from 20 to\r\n50 per cent. In most cases subsidiary dishes consist of vegetables,\r\nmeat or beans being supplied on an average only eight times a month.\r\nDormitories are in defiance of hygienic rules. In most cases only half\r\nto 1 _tsubo_ (4 square yards) are allotted to one person.\" See also\r\nAppendix LXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE COMPETITION WITH JAPAN [XLIII]. The _Jiji_ called attention in\r\nthe spring of 1921 to the way in which spinning mills in China were an\r\nincreasing menace to Japanese industry. There were in China 810,000\r\nspindles under Chinese management, 250,000 under European and 340,000\r\nunder Japanese, a total of 1,430,000, which will shortly be increased\r\nto 1,150,000 against 3,000,000 in Japan only 1,800,000 of which are at\r\nwork. The 1919 return was: China, 1,530,000; Japan, 3,200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOODWINKING THE FOREIGNER [XLIV] In the _Manchester Guardian_ Japan\r\nNumber, June 9, 1921, the managing director of a leading spinning\r\ncompany, in a page and a half article, states that among the reasons\r\nwhy a large capitalisation is needed by Japanese factories, beyond the\r\nfact of higher cost of machinery, is the \"special protection needed\r\nfor Japanese operatives and the special consideration given by the\r\nspinners to the happiness and welfare of their operatives.\" When will\r\nJapanese believe their best friends when they tell them that such\r\nattempts to hoodwink the foreigner achieve no result but to cover\r\nthemselves with ridicule?\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO [XLV]. In 1918-19 there was produced on 24,439 _chō_\r\n10,308,089 _kwan_ of tobacco. During the same period 9,681,274 _kwan_\r\nwere taken by the Government, which paid 19,114,803 yen or 1.974 per\r\n_kwan_. In 1919 there was imported leaf tobacco to the value of\r\n5,288,918 yen. Cigarettes to the value of 589,744 yen were exported.\r\nThe profits of the Tobacco Monopoly, estimated at 71 millions for\r\n1919-20, were estimated at 88 millions for 1920-1.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTORAL OFFENCES [XLVI]. There were candidates at the 1920 election\r\nwho spent 50,000 yen. It is not uncommon for the number of persons\r\ncharged with election offences to reach four figures. The\r\nqualification for a vote (law of 1918) is the payment of 3 yen of\r\nnational tax. Under the old law there were about 25 voters per 1,000\r\ninhabitants; now there are 54.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLNESS OF ESTATES [XLVII]. The number of men holding from 5 to 10\r\n_chō_ was, in 1919, 121,141 and between 10 and 50 _chō_, 45,978. The\r\nnumber holding 50 _chō_ (125 acres) and upwards was only 4,226, and\r\n400 or so of these were in Hokkaido. See also Appendix XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE WAX MAKING [XLVIII]. The wax-tree berries are flailed and\r\nthen pounded. Next comes boiling. The mush obtained is put into a bag\r\nand that bag into a wooden press. The result is wax in its first\r\nstate. A reboiling follows and then--the discovery of the method was\r\nmade by a wax manufacturer while washing his hands--a slow dropping of\r\nthe wax into water. What is taken out of the water is wax in a flaked\r\nstate. It is dried, melted and poured into moulds. The best berries\r\nyield 13 per cent. of fine wax. The variety of wax grown was _oro_\r\n(yellow wax). There is another variety. The sort I saw is grafted at\r\nthree years with its own variety. The fruitful period lasts for a\r\nquarter of a century. Roughly, the yield is 100 _kwan_ per _tan_.\r\nFormerly, wax was made from wild trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES FOR ETA [XLIX]. Eta (great defilement) is an offensive name. The\r\nphrase _tokushu buraku_ (special villages), applied to Eta hamlets, is\r\nalso objected to. _Heimin_ is the official name, but the Eta are\r\ngenerally termed _shin heimin_ (new common people), which is again\r\nregarded as invidiously distinguishing them. The name _chihō_ is now\r\nofficially proposed for Eta villages. The fact that many Eta have\r\nmade large sums during the war has somewhat improved the position of\r\ntheir class. Some Eta are well satisfied with their name and freely\r\nacknowledge their origin. Year by year intermarriage increases in\r\nJapan. A Home Department official has been quoted as saying that in\r\n1918 as many as 450 marriages were registered between Eta and ordinary\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nThe population of the village I visited, 1,900 in 300 families, was\r\ngetting its living as follows: farming 682, trade 185, industry 31,\r\nday labour 97, travelling players 180, not reported 180. The\r\nParliamentary voters were 10, prefectural 17, county 19 and village\r\n57. There were 98 ex-soldiers in the community and one man was a\r\nmember of the local education committee. The birth rate was above the\r\nlocal average. The crimes committed during the year were: theft 2,\r\ngambling 2, assault 1, police offences 3. Of the 300 families only one\r\nwas destitute, and it had been taken care of by the young women's\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the early emigrants to America were Eta.\r\nIt is now recognised that it was a short-sighted policy on the part of\r\nthe authorities to allow them to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER MAKING [L]. A paper-making outfit may cost from 60 to 70 yen\r\nonly. The shrubs grown to produce bark for paper making are _kōzo_\r\n(the paper mulberry), _mitsumata_ (_Edgworthia chrysantha_) and\r\n_gampi_ (_Wilkstroemia sikokiana_). Someone has also hit on the idea\r\nof turning the bark of the ordinary mulberry to use in paper making.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES, THE PRESS AND THE CENSORSHIP [LI]. There are 1,200\r\nlibraries in the country with 4 million books and 8 million visitors\r\nin the year. About 47,000 books are published in a year, of which less\r\nthan half, probably, are original works. From one to two hundred are\r\ntranslations, usually condensed translations. The largest number deal\r\nwith politics. There are about 3,000 newspapers and periodicals. In\r\n1917 some 1,200 issues of newspapers and periodicals attracted the\r\nattention of the censor and the sale of 600 books was prohibited. Some\r\nsixty foreign books were stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE IN BRAZIL [LII]. Emigration to South America has latterly\r\nbeen arrested through the rise in wages at home. During the past four\r\nyears an average of about 3,000 families has gone every twelve months\r\nto Brazil, where about a quarter of a million acres are owned and\r\nleased by Japanese. The Japanese Government spends 100,000 yen a year\r\non giving a grant of 50 yen to each emigrating family up to 2,000 in\r\nnumber, through the Overseas Colonisation Company. The Brazilian\r\nGovernment also offers a gratuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE KEEPING IN SOUTH-WESTERN JAPAN [LIII]. Tajima, the old province\r\nwhich comprises about four counties in Tottori, is a large supplier of\r\n\"Kobe beef,\" but it is a cattle-feeding not a grazing district. The\r\nnumber of cattle in Hyogo is double the cattle population of Tottori,\r\nbut no cattle keeper has more than a score of beasts. The usual thing\r\nis for farmers to have two or three apiece. Some of the \"Kobe beef\"\r\ncomes from the prefectures of Hiroshima and Okayama. It is in the\r\nnorth of Japan, where the people are not so thick on the ground and\r\ncultivation is less intense, that cattle production has its best\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF LAND [LIV]. The value of land in the hill-village in which I\r\nstayed necessarily varied, but the average price of paddy was given me\r\nas 250 yen per _tan_. Dry land was half that. Open hill land, that is\r\nthe so-called grass land, might be worth 120 yen. The rise in values\r\nwhich has taken place is illustrated by the following table of\r\nfarm-land values per _tan_ in 1919, published by the Bank of Japan:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 |       Paddy          |      Upland\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 |Good  |Ordinary|Bad   |Good |Ordinary|Bad\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHokkaido         |231   |158     |95    |115  |62      |26\r\n       {North }  |802   |579     |366   |477  |295     |170\r\nHonshu {Tokyo }  |863   |607     |406   |673  |442     |272\r\n(main  {middle}  |1,226 |834     |523   |875  |565     |313\r\nisland){west  }  |1,226 |840     |525   |727  |443     |244\r\nShikoku          |1,120 |784     |470   |752  |450     |225\r\nKyushu           |960   |652     |416   |538  |300     |175\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT PRODUCTION [LV]. The Japanese when they do not eat meat do not\r\nfeel the need of fruit which is experienced in the West. But there is\r\nnow a steady increase in the fruit crops. For 1918 the figures were\r\n(in thousands of _kwan_): persimmons, 43,620; pears, 27,730; oranges,\r\n73,660; peaches, 12,810; apples, 6,695; grapes, 6,240; plums (largely\r\nused pickled), 6,190.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE STUDENTS ABROAD [LVI]. During 1921 more than 200 young\r\nprofessors or candidates for professorships were sent to Europe and\r\nAmerica by the Ministry of Education. Probably another 300 were\r\nstudying on funds (£450 for a year plus fares is the grant which is\r\nmade by the Ministry of Education) supplied by the Ministries of\r\nAgriculture, of Railways and of the Army and Navy (often supplemented,\r\nno doubt, by money furnished by their families). If to these students\r\nare added those sent by independent Universities, institutions,\r\ncorporations and private firms, the total cannot be fewer than 1,000.\r\nThe students stay from six months to two or three years, and when they\r\nreturn others take their places. Counting diplomatists, business men,\r\ntourists and students there are, of course, more Japanese in Great\r\nBritain than there are British in Japan. There are fifteen hundred\r\nJapanese in London alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA PRODUCTION [LVII]. Every prefecture but Aomori produces some tea,\r\nbut very little is grown in the prefectures of the extreme north. The\r\nlargest producers are in order: Shidzuoka, Miye, Nara, Kyoto,\r\nKumamoto, Gifu, Kagoshima, Shiga, Saitama, Osaka and Ibariki. In 1919\r\nShidzuoka produced 4 million _kwan_, valued at nearly 13 million yen.\r\nBut the statistics of tea production are unsatisfactory. Much tea is\r\nproduced and sold locally which is unreported. A great deal of this is\r\nof inferior quality and produced from half-wild bushes. The 1919\r\nfigures are: area, 48,843 _chō_; number of factories, 1,122,164; green\r\ntea--_sencha_, 7,205,886 _kwan_; _bancha_, 2,580,035 _kwan; gyokuro_,\r\n75,826 _kwan_; black, 50,756 _kwan_; others, 234,868 _kwan_; _sencha_\r\ndust, 249,862 _kwan_; other dust, 486 _kwan_. Total, 10,397,719\r\n_kwan_; value, 33,377,460 yen. There was exported green tea (pan\r\nfired), 12,420,000 yen; green tea (basket fired), 4,575,000 yen;\r\nothers, 1,405,000 yen. Of this there went to the United States\r\nconsignments to the value of 15,600,000 yen and to Canada of 1,700,000\r\nyen. In 1918 the export to America was 50,000 tons; in 1919, 30,000;\r\nand in 1920, 23,000; and a further decline is expected in 1921. The\r\ntotal exports, which were, in 1909, 62 per cent, of the production,\r\nwere, in 1918, only 57 per cent, and, in 1919, 37 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEINE PERCENTAGES.--The following percentages of theine in black and\r\ngreen tea were furnished me by the Department of Agriculture:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n       |Green          |Green       |Black |Oolong\r\n       |(Basket Fired) |(Pan Fired) |      |\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nTheine |2.81           |2.22        |2.26  |2.35\r\nTannin |15.08          |14.29       |7.32  |16.15\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTheine or caffeine is a feathery-looking substance which resembles\r\nthe material of a silk-worm's cocoon. There is more theine or caffeine\r\nin tea leaves than in coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKES IN CROP STATISTICS [LVIII]. Generally speaking, it may be\r\nsaid that cereals are under-estimated and cocoons over-estimated.\r\nCereals may be 20 per cent. under-estimated. The under-estimation may\r\nno doubt be traced back to the time when taxation was on the basis of\r\nthe grain yield.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS FOR THE BLIND [LIX]. A third of the 70,000 sightless are\r\n_amma_, about a quarter as many practise acupuncture and the\r\napplication of the moxa, while nearly the same number are musicians or\r\nstorytellers. The blind have petitioned the Diet to restrict the\r\ncalling of _amma_ to men and women who have lost their sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELL SINKING FOR GAS [LX]. The presence of gas, which is odourless, is\r\nbetrayed by the discoloration of the water from which it emanates and\r\nby bubbles.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH, HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN [LXI]. In 1917-18 the\r\nconstitutions of 1,193,000 elementary school boys were reported as 53\r\nper cent. robust, 48 per cent. medium and 4 per cent. weak. The\r\nconstitutions of 1,016,000 elementary school girls were reported 49\r\nper cent. robust, 48 per cent. medium and 3 per cent. weak. Just as\r\nwomen are often underfed in Japan, girls may frequently be less well\r\nfed than boys. Elementary school boys of 16 averaged 4.84 _shaku_ in\r\nheight and 10.85 _kwan_ in weight. The average height and weight of\r\n512 elementary school girls of the same age were 4.71 _shaku_ and\r\n10.83 _kwan_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF WRESTLERS [LXII]. In a list of ten famous\r\nwrestlers the tallest is stated to be 6.30 _shaku_ (a _shaku_ is 11.93\r\ninches) and the heaviest as 33.2 _kwan_ (a _kwan_ is 8.267 lbs.). The\r\naverage height and weight of these men work out at 5.84 _shaku_ and\r\n28.4 _kwan_. By way of comparison it may be mentioned that the\r\npercentage of conscripts in 1918 over 5.5 _shaku_ was 2.58 per cent.\r\nThe average weight of Japanese is recorded as 13 _kwan_ 830 _momme_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION FROM AND AVOIDANCE OF CONSCRIPTION [LXIII]. The age is 20\r\nand the service two years (with four years in reserve and ten years\r\ndepot service). The only son of a parent over 60 unable to support\r\nhimself or herself is released. Middle school boys' service is\r\npostponed till they are 25. Students at higher schools and\r\nuniversities need not serve till 26 or 27. The service of young men\r\nabroad (i.e. elsewhere than China) is similarly postponed. (If still\r\nabroad at 37, they are entered in territorial army list and exempted.)\r\nYoung men of education equal to that of middle-school graduates can\r\nvolunteer for a year and pay 100 yen barracks expenses and be passed\r\nout with the rank of non-commissioned officers and be liable\r\nthereafter for only two terms of three months in territorial army.\r\nThere are about half a million youths liable to conscription annually.\r\nTo this number is to be added about 100,000 postponed cases. (In 1917,\r\n47,324 students, 32,263 abroad, 15,920 whereabouts unknown, 5,069 ill,\r\n3,147 criminal causes, 2,477 absentees, family reasons or crime.)\r\nEvasions in 1917: convicted, 234; suspected, 1,582. There are two\r\nconscription insurance companies with policies issued for 69 million\r\nyen. In one place charms against being conscripted are sold--at a\r\nshrine. Desertions in 1916 (7 per cent, officers) 956, of which 258\r\nreceived more than \"light punishment.\" The conscripts suffering from\r\ntrachoma were 15.3 per cent. and from venereal diseases 2.2 per cent.\r\nHeights (1918): under 5 _shaku_, 10.95 per cent.; 5-5.3 _shaku_, 53.34\r\nper cent.; 5.3-5.5 _shaku_, 33.13 per cent.; above 5.5 _shaku_, 2.58\r\nper cent. In these four classes there was a decrease in height in the\r\nfirst two of .39 per cent. and .57 per cent. respectively and an\r\nincrease in the second two of .80 per cent. and 15 per cent.\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOKKAIDO HOLDINGS [LXIV]. There are only 28 holdings of more than\r\n1,000 _chō_, 62 of over 500 _chō_, 161 over 100 _chō_ and 80 over 50\r\n_chō_. These large holdings are used for cattle breeding alone. There\r\nare no more than 620 holdings over 20 _chō_ and only 6,756 over 10.\r\nThe number over 5 _chō_ is 51,877, and over 2 _chō_ 62,015. Under the\r\narea of 2 _chō_ there are as many as 40,928. Few of the largest\r\nholdings are worked as single farms. They are let in sections to\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAUSES IN A TENANT'S CONTRACT [LXV]. (1) The tenant must make at\r\nleast 1 _chō_ of paddy every year. (2) Rent rice must be the best of\r\nthe harvest, but the tenant may pay in money. (3) In the following\r\ncases the owner will give orders to the tenants: (_a_) If tenants do\r\nnot use enough manure, (_b_) If there is disease of plants or insect\r\npests, (_c_) If the tenant neglects to mend the road or other\r\nnecessary work is neglected. (4) The owner will dismiss a tenant:\r\n(_a_) If the tenant does not pay his rent without reason, (_b_) If\r\nthe tenant is neglectful of his work or is idle, (_c_) If the tenant\r\nis not obedient to the owner and does not keep this contract\r\nfaithfully. (_d_) If the tenant is punished by the law. (5) When\r\ntenants leave without permission of absence more than twenty days the\r\nowner can treat as he will crops or buildings. (6) In the following\r\ncases the tenant must provide two labourers to the owner: mending\r\nroad, drainage canal or bridges; mending water gate and irrigation\r\ncanal; when necessary public works must be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED AREA AND LIVESTOCK [LXVI]. The area of cultivated land in\r\nJapan (counting paddy and arable) was, in 1919, 15,179,721 acres\r\n(6,071,888 _chō_). The number of animals kept for tillage purposes was\r\n1,199,970 horses and 1,036,020 homed cattle. The total number of\r\nhorses in the country was only 1,510,626 and of horned cattle,\r\nexcluding 207,891 returned as \"calving\" and 12,761 as \"deaths,\"\r\n1,307,120. Sheep, 4,546; goats, 91,777; swine, 398,155. The number of\r\nhorned cattle slaughtered in the year was 226,108. Some 86,800 horses\r\nwere also slaughtered. In Great Britain (arable, pasture and grazing\r\narea, 63 million acres) there were, in 1919, 11 million cattle, 25\r\nmillion sheep, 3 million pigs and 1-3/4 million horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS AND POULTRY [LXVII]. Even with the assistance of a tariff on\r\nChinese eggs and of a Government poultry yard, which distributes birds\r\nand sittings at cost price, there were in 1919 14,105,085 fowls and\r\n11,278,783 chickens. There was an importation of 3-1/2 million \"fresh\"\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT CONSUMPTION [LXVIII]. The present meat consumption by Japanese is\r\nuncertain, for there were in 1920[A] 3,579 foreign residents and\r\n22,104 visitors, and there is an exportation of ham and tinned and\r\npotted foods. The number of animals slaughtered in 1918 was: cattle\r\nand calves, 226,108; horses, 86,800; sheep and goats, 9,587; swine,\r\n327,074. Someone said to me that \"the nutritious flesh of the horse\r\nshould not be neglected, for the farmer is able to digest tough food.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In 1921 as many as 24,000 foreigners landed in nine months.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS IN THE MILLS [LXIX]. When we remember early and\r\nmid-Victorian conditions in English mills and the conditions of the\r\nsweat shops in New York and other American cities (vide \"Susan\r\nLenox\"), we shall be less inclined to take a harsh view of industrial\r\nJapan during a period of transition. But it is to the interest of the\r\nwoollen industry no less than that of its workers that the fact should\r\nbe stated that a competent authority has alleged that 50 per cent. of\r\nthe employees in the mills suffer from consumption and that many girls\r\nsleep ten in a room of only ten-mat size. Improvements have been made\r\nlately under the influence of legislation and enlightened\r\nself-interest--the president of the largest company is a man of\r\nforesight and public spirit--but when I was in Japan, as I recorded in\r\nthe _New East_ at the time, girls of 13 and 14 were working 11-hour\r\nday and night shifts in some mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLLEN FACTORIES [LXX]. In the Japanese woollen factory the cost of\r\nthe hands is low individually, but expensive collectively. An expert\r\nsuggested that it takes half a dozen of the unskilled girls to do the\r\nwork of an English mill-girl. It is much the same with male labour.\r\n\"An English worker may be expected to produce work equal to the output\r\nof four Japanese hands.\" Labour for heads of departments is also\r\ndifficult to get. There are textile schools and probably a hundred men\r\nare graduated yearly. But the men are not all fitted for the jobs\r\nwhich are vacant. Therefore, one finds a man acting as an engineer\r\nwho, because of his lack of technical experience, is unable to\r\nexercise sufficient control over the men in his charge. A curiosity of\r\nthe industry is the high wages which many men of this sort command.\r\nThey are really being paid better for inferior work than skilled men\r\nin England. The capital of the factories in 1918 was 46-1/2 million\r\nyen with 32-3/4 million paid up. Before the War the companies made 8\r\nper cent, as against the 2-1/2 per cent, which contents the English\r\nmanufacturer, who has often side lines to help his profits. There was\r\nmore than 100 million yen invested in the woollen textile business,\r\nmanufacturing and retail. The industry did well during the War by\r\nsupplies of cloth to Russia and of yarn and muslin to countries which\r\nordinarily are able to supply themselves. In 1918 the production\r\n(woollen fabrics and mixtures) was valued at 85 million yen (muslin,\r\n32; cloth, 21; serges, 19; blankets, 3; flannel, 1; others, 8). The\r\nimports of wool were 60 million and of yarn 251,000. In 1919 the\r\nfigures were 61 million and 710,000 respectively. In 1920 the exports\r\nwere: woollen or worsted yarns, 1,437,926 yen; woollen cloth and\r\nserges, 3,019,382 yen; blankets, 1,024,540 yen; other woollens,\r\n548,922 yen. The Nippon Wool Weaving Company, which in 1921\r\ndistributed a 20 per cent, ordinary and 20 per cent. extraordinary\r\ndividend, has 15 foreign experts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION OF HOKKAIDO [LXXI]. In 1869, 58,467; has risen as follows:\r\n\r\nYear            Population\r\n\r\n1874             174,368\r\n1884             276,414\r\n1894             616,650\r\n1904           1,233,669\r\n1914           1,869,582\r\n1919           2,137,700\r\n1920           2,359,097\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF CROP-BEARING AREA OF JAPAN [LXXII]. There is normally\r\nadded to the crop-bearing area about 53,000 _chō_ (132,000 acres) a\r\nyear. From the new crop-bearing area every year is deducted the loss\r\nof arable land from floods, the extension of cities and towns and\r\nrailways and the building of factories and institutions. This is\r\nreckoned at nearly 8,000 _chō_ in the year. One computation is that\r\nthere are 2 million _chō_ (5 million acres) available for addition to\r\nthe crop-bearing area, of which 1 million _chō_ would be convertible\r\ninto paddies. A decision was taken by the Government in 1919 to bring\r\n250,000 _chō_ under cultivation within nine years from that date, and\r\nby 1920 some 20,000 _chō_ had been reclaimed. Persons who reclaim more\r\nthan 5 _chō_ receive 6 per cent, of their expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the area of cultivation has been as follows (in\r\n_chō_):\r\n\r\n|Year     |Paddy       |Upland Farm |Total       |\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n|1905     |2,841,471   |2,540,906   |5,382,378   |\r\n|1906     |2,849,288   |2,551,170   |5,400,459   |\r\n|1907     |2,858,628   |2,639,680   |5,498,309   |\r\n|1908     |2,882,426   |2,684,531   |5,566,958   |\r\n|1909     |2,902,899   |2,777,453   |5,680,352   |\r\n|1910     |2,910,970   |2,804,434   |5,715,405   |\r\n|1911     |2,923,520   |2,836,002   |5,759,522   |\r\n|1912     |2,939,445   |2,880,301   |5,819,756   |\r\n|1913     |2,953,947   |2,902,445   |5,856,392   |\r\n|1914     |2,961,639   |2,916,569   |5,878,208   |\r\n|1915     |2,974,042   |2,948,075   |5,922,118   |\r\n|1916     |2,987,579   |2,971,800   |5,959,379   |\r\n|1917     |3,005,679   |3,012,685   |6,018,364   |\r\n|1918     |3,011,000   |3,070,000   |6,081,000   |\r\n|1919     |3,021,879   |3,050,008   |6,071,887   |\r\n\r\nWhereas the percentage of cultivated land to uncultivated was in 1909\r\n14.6 per cent., it was in 1918 15.6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE TO WHICH THE LAND IS PUT [LXXIII].

It has been suggested\r\nthat these official statistics are incomplete; 7,000 as the number of\r\nJapanese in Russian territory seems low. Even during the War, in 1917,\r\npassports were issued to 62,000 Japanese going abroad. Of these,\r\naccording to the _Japan Year-book_, 23,000 were made out for Siberia.\r\nProfessor Shiga has stated that \"no small number\" of Japanese leave\r\ntheir country as stowaways.\r\n\r\n\r\nRISE IN PRODUCTION PER \"TAN\" OF PADDY [LXXV]. The 3 or 4 _koku_ is\r\nreached in favourable circumstances only. The average is far below\r\nthis, but it rises, as shown in Appendix XV.\r\n\r\nBetween 1887 and 1915 the area under barley and wheat rose from\r\n1,591,000 _chō_ to 1,812,000 _chō_, the yield from 15,822,000 _koku_\r\nto 23,781,000 _koku_ and the yield per _tan_ from .994 _koku_ to\r\n1.313. Between 1882 and 1914 the increase in the crops of the three\r\nvarieties of millet averaged .515 _koku_ per _tan_. The increased\r\nyield of soy beans was .229 _koku_ per _tan_, of sweet potatoes 138\r\n_kwamme_ per _tan_ and of Irish potatoes 138 _kwamme_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOURERS [LXXVI]. When hired labour is required on farms it is\r\nsupplied either by relatives and neighbours or by the surplus labour\r\nof strangers who are small farmers or members of a small farmer's\r\nfamily. According to the Department of Agriculture: \"Ordinary fixed\r\nemployees are upon an equal social footing. Apprentice labourers are\r\nvery numerous. No working class holds a special social position as\r\nsuch. This is the greatest point of difference between the Japanese\r\nagricultural labour situation and that of Europe.\" The number of\r\nlabourers in October 1920 was:\r\n\r\n                           |    Day    | Seasonal| All the\r\n                           |           |         |year round|   Total\r\n---------------------------|-----------|---------|----------|---------\r\nLabourers living  { male   |   119,676 |  52,007 |  49,110  |   220,793\r\nsolely on wages,  { female |    80,870 |  42,193 |  23,862  |   146,925\r\nagricultural and  {        |           |         |          |\r\nother             {        |   200,546 |  94,200 |  72,972  |   367,718\r\n                           |           |         |          |\r\n                           |           |         |          |\r\nLabourers who are { male   |   949,266 | 407,596 | 188,369  | 1,546,231\r\nlabourers part    { female |   646,720 | 405,131 | 116,152  | 1,168,003\r\nof their time              |           |         |          |\r\n                           | 1,595,986 | 813,727 | 304,521  | 2,714,234\r\n                           |           |         |          |\r\n      Total .  .  .  .  .  | 1,796,532 | 907,927 | 377,493  | 3,081,952\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn addition to the total of 3,081,952 \"there are 32,973 agricultural\r\nlabourers who are boys and girls under 14.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREASE OF FARMERS TILLING THEIR OWN LAND [LXXVII]. In 1914 the\r\nnumber of farmers owning their own land was 1,731,247; in 1919 it had\r\nfallen to 1,700,747. In 1914 the number of tenants was 1,520,476; in\r\n1919 it had increased to 1,545,639. That is, there were 30,500 fewer\r\nlandowners and 25,163 more tenants. During the period between 1914 and\r\n1919 the number of farmers (landowners and tenants) increased 30,293.\r\nWhile from 1909 to 1914 the percentage of landowners fell from 33.27\r\nto 31.73, the percentage of tenant farmers rose from 27.69 to 27.87\r\nand the percentage of persons partly owner and partly tenant from\r\n39.04 to 40.40. See Appendix XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL AND URBAN POPULATIONS [LXXVIII]. The following table shows the\r\npercentage of the population living in communes under 5,000 and 10,000\r\ninhabitants in 1913 and 1918:\r\n\r\n Year | Percentage of Population living in | Percentage of Families\r\n      |           Communities              | engaged in Agricultural\r\n      |------------------------------------|  to Total Families in\r\n      |  under 5,000  |  under 10,000      |       Japan Proper\r\n------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------\r\n 1913 |     50.44     |       72.39        |          57.6\r\n 1918 |     46.23     |       67.71        |          52.3\r\n------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------\r\n      |     -4.21     |       -4.68        |          -5.3\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese figures clearly indicate the decrease of the rural population.\r\nTo take 10,000 inhabitants as the demarcation line between urban and\r\nrural population is probably less correct than to take a demarcation\r\nline of 7,500 inhabitants. A mean of the two percentages of\r\npopulations living in communities under 5,000 and under 10,000\r\ninhabitants shows 61.41 per cent, in 1913 and 56.97 per cent, in 1918,\r\na decrease of 4.44 per cent. The variation between this result and the\r\npreceding one has a simple explanation. About 30 per cent, of the\r\nfamilies engaged in agriculture carry on their farming as an accessory\r\nbusiness. Teachers, priests and mechanics may all have patches of\r\nland. On the other hand, a small number of people have no land.\r\nTherefore, the percentage of the rural population is only slightly\r\nhigher than that of the families engaged in agriculture. In 1918 there\r\nwere 5,476,784 farming families (to 10,460,440 total families or 52.3\r\nper cent.), and if we multiply by 5-1/3--the average number of persons\r\nper family in Japan is 5.317 (1918)--to find the population dependent\r\non agriculture, the number is 29,209,514. The total population of\r\nJapan in 1918 was 55,667,711. The Department of Agriculture has stated\r\nthat on the basis of the census of 1918 the number of persons in\r\nhouseholds engaged in agriculture was 52 per cent. of the population.\r\nAccording to one set of statistics the percentage of farming families\r\nto non-farming families fell from 64 per cent, in 1904 to 60.3 per\r\ncent. in 1910 and 56 in 1914. We shall probably not be far wrong in\r\nsupposing the rural population to be at present about 55 per cent, of\r\nthe population. The percentage of persons actually working on the\r\nfarms is another matter. As has been seen, some 30 per cent, of the\r\n5-1/2 million farming families are engaged in agriculture as a\r\nsecondary business only. It may be, therefore, that the 5-1/2 million\r\nfamilies do not actually yield more than 10 million effective farm\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS RICE THE RIGHT CROP FOR JAPAN [LXXIX]. Mr. Katsuro Hara, of the\r\nCollege of Literature, Kyoto University, asks, \"Is Japan specially\r\nadapted for the production of rice?\" and answers: \"Southern Japan is\r\nof course not unfit. But rice does not conform to the climate of\r\nnorthern Japan. This explains the reason why there have been repeated\r\nfamines. By the choice of this uncertain kind of crop as the principal\r\nfoodstuff the Japanese have been obliged to acquiesce in a\r\ncomparatively enhanced cost of living. The tardiness of civilisation\r\nmay be perhaps partly attributed to this fact. Why did our forefathers\r\nprefer rice to other cereals? Was a choice made in Japan? If the\r\nchoice was made in this country the unwisdom of the choice and of the\r\nchoosers is now very patent.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with this expression of opinion may be set the following\r\nfigures, showing the total production of rice and of other grain crops\r\nduring the past six years, in thousands of _koku_:\r\n\r\n---------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------|--------\r\n   Year  |  Barley  | Naked Barley  | Wheat  | Barley and  |  Rice\r\n         |          |               |        |   Wheat     |\r\n---------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------|--------\r\n   1915  | 10,253   |    8,296      | 5,231  |   23,781    | 55,924\r\n   1916  |  9,559   |    7,921      | 5,869  |   23,350    | 58,442\r\n   1917  |  9,169   |    8,197      | 6,786  |   24,155    | 54,658\r\n   1918  |  8,368   |    7,777      | 6,431  |   22,576    | 54,699\r\n   1919  |  9,664   |    7,995      | 5,611  |   23,271    | 60,818\r\n---------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------|--------\r\n\r\nFrom 1910 to 1919 the areas under barleys and wheat were, in _chō_,\r\n1,771,655-1,729,148, and under rice 2,949,440-3,104,611.\r\n\r\n\r\nINNER COLONISATION _v_. FOREIGN EXPANSION [LXXX]. _An Introduction to\r\nthe History of Japan_ (1921), written by an Imperial University\r\nprofessor and published by the Yamato Society, the members of which\r\ninclude some of the most distinguished men in Japan, says: \"It is\r\ndoubtful whether the backwardness of the north can be solely\r\nattributed to its climatic inferiority. Even in the depth of winter\r\nthe cold in the northern provinces cannot be said to be more\r\nunbearable than that of the Scandinavian countries or of north-eastern\r\nGermany. The principal cause of the retardation of progress in\r\nnorthern Japan lies rather in the fact that it is comparatively\r\nrecently exploited.... The northern provinces might have become far\r\nmore populous, civilised and prosperous than we see them now.\r\nUnfortunately for the north, just at the most critical time in its\r\ndevelopment the attention of the nation was compelled to turn from\r\ninner colonisation to foreign relations. The subsequent acquisition of\r\ndominions oversea made the nation still more indifferent.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a report of the Hokkaido Government in 1921, the number\r\nof immigrants during the latest three year period was 90,000, and one\r\nand a half million acres are available for cultivation and\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE _v_. COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY [LXXXI]. There is supposed to\r\nbe more money invested in land than in commerce or industry.\r\nComprehensive figures of a trustworthy kind establishing the relative\r\nimportance of agriculture, commerce and industry are not readily\r\nobtained. \"This is a question,\" writes a Japanese professor of\r\nagriculture to me, \"which we should like to study very much.\"\r\nIndustrial and commercial figures at the end of and immediately after\r\nthe War are not of much use because of the inflation of that period.\r\nThe annual value of agricultural production before the War was about\r\n1,800 million yen; it must be by now about 2,500 or 3,000. In 1912,\r\naccording to the Department of Finance, the debt of the agricultural\r\npopulation was 740 million yen. In 1916 the Japan Mortgage Bank and\r\nthe prefectural agricultural and industrial banks had together\r\nadvanced to agricultural organisations 110 millions and to other\r\nborrowers 273 millions. In 1915 co-operative credit associations had\r\nadvanced 45 millions to farmers and 11 millions to other borrowers.\r\nThe paid-up capital of companies, was, in 1913, 1,983 million, of\r\nwhich 27 million was agricultural, and in 1916, 2,434 million, of\r\nwhich 31 million was agricultural. The reserves were, in 1913, 542\r\nmillion, of which 1 million was agricultural, and in 1916, 841\r\nmillion, of which 3 were agricultural. (For some reason or other,\r\n\"fishing\" is included under \"agricultural.\" On careful dissection I\r\nfind that of the 45 million of investments credited to agriculture in\r\n1918, only 28 million are purely agricultural.) The land tax is\r\nestimated to yield 73 million yen in 1920-1. It is 2-1/2 per cent. on\r\nresidential land, 4.5 per cent. on paddy and cultivated land--3.2 per\r\ncent, in Hokkaido--and 5.5 per cent. on other land--4 per cent. in\r\nHokkaido.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n_This Index may be regarded as a Glossary inasmuch as every Japanese\r\nword which occurs in the book will be found in it.

The Chapter title\r\ndoes not use a macron at all, and has been left as printed.\r\nIndex: Entry for 'Yukata' should not have a macron on the u - verified\r\nthis from another source, made correction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Foundations of Japan, by J.W.
