BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE TALE BEGINS WITH THE ENGAGING OF A \"TAIL\"--AND THE CAPTAIN DELIVERS\r\nHIS OPINIONS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning stood with his back to the fireplace in the back-parlour\r\nof a temperance coffee-house in a certain town on the eastern seaboard\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nThe name of that town is unimportant, and, for reasons with which the\r\nreader has nothing to do, we do not mean to disclose it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning, besides being the owner and commander of a South Sea\r\nwhale-ship, was the owner of a large burly body, a pair of broad\r\nshoulders, a pair of immense red whiskers that met under his chin, a\r\nshort, red little nose, a large firm mouth, and a pair of light-blue\r\neyes, which, according to their owner's mood, could flash like those of\r\na tiger or twinkle sweetly like the eyes of a laughing child.  But his\r\neyes seldom flashed; they more frequently twinkled, for the captain was\r\nthe very soul of kindliness and good-humour.  Yet he was abrupt and\r\nsharp in his manner, so that superficial observers sometimes said he was\r\nhasty.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning was, so to speak, a sample of three primary colours--\r\nred, blue, and yellow--a walking fragment, as it were, of the rainbow.\r\nHis hair and face, especially the nose, were red; his eyes, coat, and\r\npantaloons were blue, and his waistcoat was yellow.\r\n\r\nAt the time we introduce him to the reader he was standing, as we have\r\nsaid, with his back to the fireplace, although there was no fire, the\r\nweather being mild, and with his hands in his breeches pockets.  Having\r\nworked with the said hands for many long years before the mast, until he\r\nhad at last worked himself _behind_ the mast, in other words, on to the\r\nquarterdeck and into possession of his own ship, the worthy captain\r\nconceived that he had earned the right to give his hands a long rest;\r\naccordingly he stowed them away in his pockets and kept them there at\r\nall times, save when necessity compelled him to draw them forth.\r\n\r\n\"Very odd,\" remarked Captain Dunning, looking at his black straw hat\r\nwhich lay on the table before him, as if the remark were addressed to\r\nit--\"very odd if, having swallowed the cow, I should now be compelled to\r\nworry at the tail.\"\r\n\r\nAs the black straw hat made no reply, the captain looked up at the\r\nceiling, but not meeting with any response from that quarter, he looked\r\nout at the window and encountered the gaze of a seaman flattening his\r\nnose on a pane of glass, and looking in.\r\n\r\nThe captain smiled.  \"Ah! here's a tail at last,\" he said, as the seaman\r\ndisappeared, and in another moment reappeared at the door with his hat\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary, perhaps, to explain that Captain Dunning had just\r\nsucceeded in engaging a first-rate crew for his next whaling voyage\r\n(which was the \"cow\" he professed to have swallowed), with the exception\r\nof a cook (which was the \"tail,\" at which he feared he might be\r\ncompelled to worry).\r\n\r\n\"You're a cook, are you?\" he asked, as the man entered and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the \"tail,\" pulling his forelock.\r\n\r\n\"And an uncommonly ill-favoured rascally-looking cook you are,\" thought\r\nthe captain; but he did not say so, for he was not utterly regardless of\r\nmen's feelings.  He merely said, \"Ah!\" and then followed it up with the\r\nabrupt question--\r\n\r\n\"Do you drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, and smoke too,\" replied the \"tail,\" in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Very good; then you can go,\" said the captain, shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Eh!\" exclaimed the man:\r\n\r\n\"You can go,\" repeated the captain.  \"You won't suit.  My ship is a\r\ntemperance ship, and all the hands are teetotalers.  I have found from\r\nexperience that men work better, and speak better, and in every way act\r\nbetter, on tea and coffee than on spirits.  I don't object to their\r\nsmoking; but I don't allow drinkin' aboard my ship; so you won't do, my\r\nman.  Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"tail\" gazed at the captain in mute amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you may look,\" observed the captain, replying to the gaze; \"but you\r\nmay also mark my words, if you will.  I've not sailed the ocean for\r\nthirty years for nothing.  I've seen men in hot seas and in cold--on\r\ngrog, and on tea--and _I_ know that coffee and tea carry men through the\r\nhardest work better than grog.  I also know that there's a set o' men in\r\nthis world who look upon teetotalers as very soft chaps--old wives, in\r\nfact.  Very good,\" (here the captain waxed emphatic, and struck his fist\r\non the table.) \"Now look here, young man, _I'm_ an old wife, and my\r\nship's manned by similar old ladies; so you won't suit.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the seaman made no reply, but feeling doubtless, as he regarded\r\nthe masculine specimen before him, that he would be quite out of his\r\nelement among such a crew of females, he thrust a quid of tobacco into\r\nhis cheek, put on his hat, turned on his heel and left the room,\r\nshutting the door after him with a bang.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely left when a tap at the door announced a second visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Hum!  Another `tail,' I suppose.  Come in.\"\r\n\r\nIf the new-comer _was_ a \"tail,\" he was decidedly a long one, being six\r\nfeet three in his stockings at the very least.\r\n\r\n\"You wants a cook, I b'lieve?\" said the man, pulling off his hat.\r\n\r\n\"I do.  Are you one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I jist guess I am.  Bin a cook for fifteen year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been to sea as a cook?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I jist have.  Once to the South Seas, twice to the North, an' once\r\nround the world.  Cook all the time.  I've roasted, and stewed, and\r\ngrilled, and fried, and biled, right round the 'arth, I have.\"\r\n\r\nBeing apparently satisfied with the man's account of himself, Captain\r\nDunning put to him the question--\"Do you drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, like a fish; for I drinks nothin' but water, I don't.  Bin born and\r\nraised in the State of Maine, d'ye see, an' never tasted a drop all my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the captain, who plumed himself on being a clever\r\nphysiognomist, and had already formed a good opinion of the man.  \"Do\r\nyou ever swear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, but when I can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I'm fit to bu'st.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied the captain, \"you must learn to bu'st without swearin',\r\n'cause I don't allow it aboard my ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe man evidently regarded his questioner as a very extraordinary and\r\neccentric individual; but he merely replied, \"I'll try;\" and after a\r\nlittle further conversation an agreement was come to; the man was sent\r\naway with orders to repair on board immediately, as everything was in\r\nreadiness to \"up anchor and away next morning.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus satisfactorily and effectually disposed of the \"tail,\"\r\nCaptain Dunning put on his hat very much on the back of his head, knit\r\nhis brows, and pursed his lips firmly, as if he had still some important\r\nduty to perform; then, quitting the hotel, he traversed the streets of\r\nthe town with rapid strides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT PERSONAGES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE READER--THE CAPTAIN MAKES\r\nINSANE RESOLUTIONS, FIGHTS A BATTLE, AND CONQUERS.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the town whose name we have declined to communicate,\r\nthere stood a house--a small house--so small that it might have been\r\nmore appropriately, perhaps, styled a cottage.  This house had a\r\nyellow-painted face, with a green door in the middle, which might have\r\nbeen regarded as its nose, and a window on each side thereof, which\r\nmight have been considered its eyes.  Its nose was, as we have said,\r\npainted green, and its eyes had green Venetian eyelids, which were half\r\nshut at the moment Captain Dunning walked up to it as if it were calmly\r\ncontemplating that seaman's general appearance.\r\n\r\nThere was a small garden in front of the house, surrounded on three\r\nsides by a low fence.  Captain Dunning pushed open the little gate,\r\nwalked up to the nose of the house, and hit it several severe blows with\r\nhis knuckles.  The result was that the nose opened, and a servant-girl\r\nappeared in the gap.\r\n\r\n\"Is your mistress at home?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Guess she is--both of 'em!\" replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Tell both of 'em I'm here, then,\" said the captain, stepping into the\r\nlittle parlour without further ceremony; \"and is my little girl in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she's in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then send her here too, an' look alive, lass.\"  So saying, Captain\r\nDunning sat down on the sofa, and began to beat the floor with his right\r\nfoot somewhat impatiently.\r\n\r\nIn another second a merry little voice was heard in the passage, the\r\ndoor burst open, a fair-haired girl of about ten years of age sprang\r\ninto the room, and immediately commenced to strangle her father in a\r\nseries of violent embraces.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Ailie, my darling, one would think you had not seen me for fifty\r\nyears at least,\" said the captain, holding his daughter at arm's-length,\r\nin order the more satisfactorily to see her.\r\n\r\n\"It's a whole week, papa, since you last came to see me,\" replied the\r\nlittle one, striving to get at her father's neck again, \"and I'm sure it\r\nseems to me like a hundred years at least.\"\r\n\r\nAs the child said this she threw her little arms round her father, and\r\nkissed his large, weather-beaten visage all over--eyes, mouth, nose,\r\nchin, whiskers, and, in fact, every attainable spot.  She did it so\r\nvigorously, too, that an observer would have been justified in expecting\r\nthat her soft, delicate cheeks would be lacerated by the rough contact;\r\nbut they were not.  The result was a heightening of the colour, nothing\r\nmore.  Having concluded this operation, she laid her cheek on the\r\ncaptain's and endeavoured to clasp her hands at the back of his neck,\r\nbut this was no easy matter.  The captain's neck was a remarkably thick\r\none, and the garments about that region were voluminous; however, by\r\ndint of determination, she got the small fingers intertwined, and then\r\ngave him a squeeze that ought to have choked him, but it didn't: many a\r\nstrong man had tried that in his day, and had failed signally.\r\n\r\n\"You'll stay a long time with me before you go away to sea again, won't\r\nyou, dear papa?\" asked the child earnestly, after she had given up the\r\nfutile effort to strangle him.\r\n\r\n\"How like!\" murmured the captain, as if to himself, and totally\r\nunmindful of the question, while he parted the fair curls and kissed\r\nAilie's forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Like what, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like your mother--your beloved mother,\" replied the captain, in a low,\r\nsad voice.\r\n\r\nThe child became instantly grave, and she looked up in her father's face\r\nwith an expression of awe, while he dropped his eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice had never known a mother's love.  Her mother died when she\r\nwas a few weeks old, and she had been confided to the care of two maiden\r\naunts--excellent ladies, both of them; good beyond expression; correct\r\nalmost to a fault; but prim, starched, and extremely self-possessed and\r\njudicious, so much so that they were injudicious enough to repress some\r\nof the best impulses of their natures, under the impression that a\r\ncertain amount of dignified formality was essential to good breeding and\r\ngood morals in every relation of life.\r\n\r\nDear, good, starched Misses Dunning! if they had had their way, boys\r\nwould have played cricket and football with polite urbanity, and girls\r\nwould have kissed their playmates with gentle solemnity.  They did their\r\nbest to subdue little Alice, but that was impossible.  The child _would_\r\nrush about the house at all unexpected and often inopportune seasons,\r\nlike a furiously insane kitten and she _would_ disarrange their collars\r\ntoo violently every evening when she bade them good-night.\r\n\r\nAlice was intensely sympathetic.  It was quite enough for her to see any\r\none in tears, to cause her to open up the flood-gates of her eyes and\r\nweep--she knew not and she cared not why.  She threw her arms round her\r\nfather's neck again, and hugged him, while bright tears trickled like\r\ndiamonds from her eyes.  No diamonds are half so precious or so\r\ndifficult to obtain as tears of genuine sympathy!\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to go with me to the whale-fishery?\" inquired\r\nCaptain Dunning, somewhat abruptly as he disengaged the child's arms and\r\nset her on his knee.\r\n\r\nThe tears stopped in an instant, as Alice leaped, with the happy\r\nfacility of childhood, totally out of one idea and thoroughly into\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I should like it _so_ much!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how much is `so' much, Ailie?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\nAilie pursed her mouth, and looked at her father earnestly, while she\r\nseemed to struggle to give utterance to some fleeting idea.\r\n\r\n\"Think,\" she said quickly, \"think something good _as much as ever you\r\ncan_.  Have you thought?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the captain, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Ailie, \"its twenty thousand million times as much as\r\nthat, and a great deal more!\"\r\n\r\nThe laugh with which Captain Dunning received this curious explanation\r\nof how much his little daughter wished to go with him to the\r\nwhale-fishery, was interrupted by the entrance of his sisters, whose\r\nsense of propriety induced them to keep all visitors waiting at least a\r\nquarter of an hour before they appeared, lest they should be charged\r\nwith unbecoming precipitancy.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, lassies; how are ye?\" cried the captain as he rose and\r\nkissed each lady on the cheek heartily.\r\n\r\nThe sisters did not remonstrate.  They knew that their brother was past\r\nhope in this respect, and they loved him, so they suffered it meekly.\r\n\r\nHaving admitted that they were well--as well, at least, as could be\r\nexpected, considering the cataract of \"trials\" that perpetually\r\ndescended upon their devoted heads--they sat down as primly as if their\r\nvisitor were a perfect stranger, and entered into a somewhat lengthened\r\nconversation as to the intended voyage, commencing, of course, with the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said the captain, rubbing the crown of his straw hat in a\r\ncircular manner, as if it were a beaver, \"I'm coming to the point.\"\r\n\r\nBoth ladies exclaimed, \"What point, George?\" simultaneously, and\r\nregarded the captain with a look of anxious surprise.\r\n\r\n\"_The_ point,\" replied the captain, \"about which I've come here to-day.\r\nIt ain't a point o' the compass; nevertheless, I've been steerin' it in\r\nmy mind's eye for a considerable time past.  The fact is\" (here the\r\ncaptain hesitated), \"I--I've made up my mind to take my little Alice\r\nalong with me this voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Misses Dunning wore unusually tall caps, and their countenances were\r\nby nature uncommonly long, but the length to which they grew on hearing\r\nthis announcement was something preternaturally awful.\r\n\r\n\"Take Ailie to sea!\" exclaimed Miss Martha Dunning, in horror.\r\n\r\n\"To fish for whales!\" added Miss Jane Dunning, in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, you're mad!\" they exclaimed together, after a breathless\r\npause; \"and you'll do nothing of the kind,\" they added firmly.\r\n\r\nNow, the manner in which the Misses Dunning received this intelligence\r\ngreatly relieved their eccentric brother.  He had fully anticipated, and\r\nvery much dreaded, that they would at once burst into tears, and being a\r\ntender-hearted man he knew that he could not resist that without a hard\r\nstruggle.  A flood of woman's tears, he was wont to say, was the only\r\nsort of salt water storm he hadn't the heart to face.  But abrupt\r\nopposition was a species of challenge which the captain always accepted\r\nat once--off-hand.  No human power could force him to any course of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn this latter quality Captain Dunning was neither eccentric nor\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry you don't like my proposal, my dear sisters,\" said he; \"but\r\nI'm resolved.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't!\" said Martha.\r\n\r\n\"You shan't!\" cried Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I _will_!\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause here of considerable length, during which the captain\r\nobserved that Martha's nostrils began to twitch nervously.  Jane,\r\nobserving the fact, became similarly affected.  To the captain's\r\npractised eye these symptoms were as good as a barometer.  He knew that\r\nthe storm was coming, and took in all sail at once (mentally) to be\r\nready for it.\r\n\r\nIt came!  Martha and Jane Dunning were for once driven from the shelter\r\nof their wonted propriety--they burst simultaneously into tears, and\r\nburied their respective faces in their respective pocket-handkerchiefs,\r\nwhich were immaculately clean and had to be hastily unfolded for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, my dear girls,\" cried the captain, starting up and patting\r\ntheir shoulders, while poor little Ailie clasped her hands, sat down on\r\na footstool, looked up in their faces--or, rather, at the backs of the\r\nhands which covered their faces--and wept quietly.\r\n\r\n\"It's very cruel, George--indeed it is,\" sobbed Martha; \"you know how we\r\nlove her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" remarked the obdurate captain; \"but you _don't_ know how\r\n_I_ love her, and how sad it makes me to see so little of her, and to\r\nthink that she may be learning to forget me--or, at least,\" added the\r\ncaptain, correcting himself as Ailie looked at him reproachfully through\r\nher tears--\"at least to do without me.  I can't bear the thought.  She's\r\nall I have left to me, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" interrupted Martha, looking hastily up, \"did you ever before\r\nhear of such a thing as taking a little girl on a voyage to the\r\nwhale-fishing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never,\" replied the captain; \"what has that got to do with it?\"\r\n\r\nBoth ladies held up their hands and looked aghast.  The idea of any man\r\nventuring to do what no one ever thought of doing before was so utterly\r\nsubversive of all their ideas of propriety--such a desperate piece of\r\nprofane originality--that they remained speechless.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said Martha, drying her eyes, and speaking in tones of deep\r\nsolemnity, \"did you ever read _Robinson Crusoe_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did, when I was a boy; an' that wasn't yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you,\" continued the lady in the same sepulchral tone, \"did you\r\nnote how that man--that beacon, if I may use the expression, set up as a\r\nwarning to deter all wilful boys and men from reckless, and wicked, and\r\nwandering, and obstreperous courses--did you note, I say, how that man,\r\nthat beacon, was shipwrecked, and spent a dreary existence on an\r\nuninhabited and dreadful island, in company with a low, dissolute,\r\nblack, unclothed companion called Friday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the captain, seeing that she paused for a reply.\r\n\r\n\"And all,\" continued Martha, \"in consequence of his resolutely and\r\nobstinately, and wilfully and wickedly going to sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it couldn't have happened if he hadn't gone to sea, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" argued Martha, \"will you, can you, George, contemplate the\r\npossibility of your only daughter coming to the same dreadful end?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, not exactly seeing the connection, rubbed his nose with his\r\nforefinger, and replied--\"Certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are bound,\" continued Martha, in triumph, \"by all that is\r\nupright and honourable, by all the laws of humanity and _propriety_, to\r\ngive up this wild intention--and you _must_!\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" cried Miss Jane emphatically, as if the argument were\r\nunanswerable--as indeed it was, being incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe last words were unfortunate.  They merely riveted the captain's\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n\"You talk a great deal of nonsense, Martha,\" he said, rising to depart.\r\n\"I've fixed to take her, so the sooner you make up your minds to it the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nThe sisters knew their brother's character too well to waste more time\r\nin vain efforts; but Martha took him by the arm, and said\r\nearnestly--\"Will you promise me, my dear George, that when she comes\r\nback from this voyage, you will never take her on another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear sister,\" replied the captain, somewhat melted, \"I promise\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word Martha sat down and held out her arms to Ailie, who\r\nincontinently rushed into them.  Propriety fled for the nonce,\r\ndiscomfited.  Miss Martha's curls were disarranged beyond repair, and\r\nMiss Martha's collar was crushed to such an extent that the very\r\nlaundress who had washed and starched and ironed it would have utterly\r\nfailed to recognise it.  Miss Jane looked on at these improprieties in\r\nperfect indifference--nay, when, after her sister had had enough, the\r\nchild was handed over to her, she submitted to the same violent\r\ntreatment without a murmur.  For once Nature was allowed to have her\r\nway, and all three had a good hearty satisfactory cry; in the midst of\r\nwhich Captain Dunning left them, and, proceeding on board his ship,\r\nhastened the preparations for his voyage to the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE TEA-PARTY--ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS OF A MINOR KIND--GLYNN PROCTOR\r\nGETS INTO TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day in which the foregoing scenes were enacted,\r\nthe Misses Dunning prepared a repast for their brother and one or two of\r\nhis officers, who were to spend the last evening in port there, and\r\ndiscuss various important and unimportant matters in a sort of\r\nsemi-convivio-business way.\r\n\r\nAn event of this kind was always of the deepest interest and productive\r\nof the most intense anxiety to the amiable though starched sisters;\r\nfirst, because it was of rare occurrence; and second, because they were\r\nnever quite certain that it would pass without some unhappy accident,\r\nsuch as the upsetting of a tea-cup or a kettle, or the scalding of the\r\ncat, not to mention visitors' legs.  They seemed to regard a tea-party\r\nin the light of a firearm--a species of blunderbuss--a thing which, it\r\nwas to be hoped, would \"go off well\"; and, certainly, if loading the\r\ntable until it groaned had anything to do with the manner of its \"going\r\noff,\" there was every prospect of its doing so with pre-eminent success\r\nupon that occasion.\r\n\r\nBut besides the anxieties inseparable from the details of the pending\r\nfestivities, the Misses Dunning were overwhelmed and weighed down with\r\nadditional duties consequent upon their brother's sudden and unexpected\r\ndetermination.  Little Ailie had to be got ready for sea by the\r\nfollowing morning!  It was absolute and utter insanity!  No one save a\r\nmadman or a sea-captain could have conceived such a thing, much less\r\nhave carried it into effect tyrannically.\r\n\r\nThe Misses Dunning could not attempt any piece of duty or work\r\nseparately.  They always acted together, when possible; and might, in\r\nfact, without much inconvenience, have been born Siamese twins.\r\nWhatever Martha did, Jane attempted to do or to mend; wherever Jane\r\nwent, Martha followed.  Not, by any means, that one thought she could\r\nimprove upon the work of the other; their conduct was simply the result\r\nof a desire to assist each other mutually.  When Martha spoke, Jane\r\nechoed or corroborated; and when Jane spoke, Martha repeated her\r\nsentences word for word in a scarcely audible whisper--not after the\r\nother had finished, but during the course of the remarks.\r\n\r\nWith such dispositions and propensities, it is not a matter to be\r\nwondered at that the good ladies, while arranging the tea-table, should\r\nsuddenly remember some forgotten article of Ailie's wardrobe, and rush\r\nsimultaneously into the child's bedroom to rectify the omission; or,\r\nwhen thus engaged, be filled with horror at the thought of having left\r\nthe buttered toast too near the fire in the parlour.\r\n\r\n\"It is really quite perplexing,\" said Martha, sitting down with a sigh,\r\nand regarding the tea-table with a critical gaze; \"quite perplexing.\r\nI'm sure I don't know how I shall bear it.  It is too bad of George--\r\ndarling Ailie--(dear me, Jane, how crookedly you have placed the urn)--\r\nit is really too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad, indeed; yes, isn't it?\" echoed Jane, in reference to the\r\ncaptain's conduct, while she assisted Martha, who had risen to readjust\r\nthe urn.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Martha, with a look of horror.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Jane, who looked and felt equally horrified, although she\r\nknew not yet the cause.\r\n\r\n\"The eggs!\"\r\n\r\n\"The eggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the eggs.  You know every one of the last dozen we got was bad,\r\nand we've forgot to send for more,\" said Martha.\r\n\r\n\"For more; so we have!\" cried Jane; and both ladies rushed into the\r\nkitchen, gave simultaneous and hurried orders to the servant-girl, and\r\nsent her out of the house impressed with an undefined feeling that life\r\nor death depended on the instant procuring of two dozen fresh eggs.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to remark here, that the Misses Dunning, although\r\nstiff, and starched, and formal, had the power of speeding nimbly from\r\nroom to room, when alone and when occasion required, without in the\r\nleast degree losing any of their stiffness or formality, so that we do\r\nnot use the terms \"rush,\" \"rushed,\" or \"rushing\" inappropriately.\r\nNevertheless, it may also be remarked that they never acted in a rapid\r\nor impulsive way in company, however small in numbers or unceremonious\r\nin character the company might be--always excepting the servant-girl and\r\nthe cat, to whose company, from long habit, they had become used, and\r\ntherefore indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe sisters were on their knees, stuffing various articles into a large\r\ntrunk, and Ailie was looking on, by way of helping, with very red and\r\nswollen eyes, and the girl was still absent in quest of eggs, when a\r\nsuccession of sounding blows were administered to the green door, and a\r\nnumber of gruff voices were heard conversing without.\r\n\r\n\"_There_!\" cried Martha and Jane, with bitter emphasis, looking in each\r\nother's faces as if to say, \"We knew it.  Before that girl was sent away\r\nfor these eggs, we each separately and privately prophesied that they\r\nwould arrive, and that we should have to open the door.  And you see, so\r\nit has happened, and we are not ready!\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no time for remark.  The case was desperate.  Both sisters\r\nfelt it to be so, and acted accordingly, while Ailie, having been\r\nforbidden to open the door, sat down on her trunk, and looked on in\r\nsurprise.  They sprang up, washed their hands simultaneously in the same\r\nbasin, with the same piece of soap broken in two; dried them with the\r\nsame towel, darted to the mirror, put on two identically similar clean\r\ntall caps, leaped down-stairs, opened the door with slow dignity of\r\ndemeanour, and received their visitors in the hall with a calmness and\r\nurbanity of manner that contrasted rather strangely with their flushed\r\ncountenances and heaving bosoms.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Ailie!\" exclaimed the captain, as his daughter pulled down his\r\nhead to be kissed.  \"Why, you take a fellow all aback, like a white\r\nsquall.  Are you ready, my pet?  Kit stowed and anchor tripped?  Come\r\nthis way, and let us talk about it.  Dear me, Martha, you and Jane--look\r\nas if you had been running a race, eh?  Here are my messmates come to\r\ntalk a bit with you.  My sisters, Martha and Jane--Dr Hopley.\"  (Dr\r\nHopley bowed politely.) \"My first mate, Mr Millons\" (Mr Millons also\r\nbowed, somewhat loosely); \"and Rokens--Tim Rokens, my chief harpooner.\"\r\n(Mr Rokens pulled his forelock, and threw back his left leg, apparently\r\nto counterbalance the bend in his body.) \"He didn't want to come; said\r\nhe warn't accustomed to ladies' society; but I told him you warn't\r\nladies--a--I don't mean that--not ladies o' the high-flyin' fashionable\r\nsort, that give themselves airs, you know.  Come along, Ailie.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the captain ran on in this strain, hung up his hat, kissed Ailie,\r\nand ran his fingers through his shaggy locks, the Misses Dunning\r\nperformed a mingled bow and courtsey to each guest as his name was\r\nmentioned, and shook hands with him, after which the whole party entered\r\nthe parlour, where the cat was discovered enjoying a preliminary meal of\r\nits own at one of the pats of butter.  A united shriek from Martha\r\nand Jane, a nautical howl from the guests, and a rolled-up\r\npocket-handkerchief from Rokens sent that animal from the table as if it\r\nhad received a galvanic shock.\r\n\r\n\"I ax yer parding, ladies,\" said Mr Rokens, whose aim had been so\r\nperfect that his handkerchief not only accelerated the flight of the\r\ncat, but carried away the violated pat of butter along with it.  \"I ax\r\nyer parding, but them brutes is sich thieves--I could roast 'em alive,\r\nso I could.\"\r\n\r\nThe harpooner unrolled his handkerchief, and picking the pat of butter\r\nfrom its folds with his fingers, threw it into the fire.  Thereafter he\r\nsmoothed down his hair, and seated himself on the extreme edge of a\r\nchair, as near the door as possible.  Not that he had any intention\r\nwhatever of taking to flight, but he deemed that position to be more\r\nsuited to his condition than any other.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the servant-girl returned with the eggs.  While she is\r\nengaged in boiling them, we shall introduce Captain Dunning's friends\r\nand messmates to the reader.\r\n\r\nDr Hopley was a surgeon, and a particular friend of the captain's.  He\r\nwas an American by birth, but had travelled so much about the world that\r\nhe had ceased to \"guess\" and \"calculate,\" and to speak through his nose.\r\nHe was a man about forty, tall, big-boned, and muscular, though not\r\nfat; and besides being a gentlemanly man, was a good-natured, quiet\r\ncreature, and a clever enough fellow besides, but he preferred to laugh\r\nat and enjoy the jokes and witticisms of others rather than to\r\nperpetrate any himself.  Dr Hopley was intensely fond of travelling,\r\nand being possessed of a small independence, he indulged his passion to\r\nthe utmost.  He had agreed to go with Captain Dunning as the ship's\r\ndoctor, simply for the sake of seeing the whale-fishery of the South\r\nSeas, having already, in a similar capacity, encountered the dangers of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nDr Hopley had few weaknesses.  His chief one was an extravagant belief\r\nin phrenology.  We would not be understood to imply that phrenology is\r\nextravagant; but we assert that the doctor's belief in it was\r\nextravagant, assigning, as he did, to every real and ideal facility of\r\nthe human mind \"a local habitation and a name\" in the cranium, with a\r\ncorresponding depression or elevation of the surface to mark its\r\nwhereabouts.  In other respects he was a commonplace sort of a man.\r\n\r\nMr Millons, the first mate, was a short, hale, thick-set man, without\r\nany particularly strong points of character.  He was about thirty-five,\r\nand possessed a superabundance of fair hair and whiskers, with a large,\r\nbroad chin, a firm mouth, rather fierce-looking eyes, and a hasty, but\r\nby no means a bad temper.  He was a trustworthy, matter-of-fact seaman,\r\nand a good officer, but not bright intellectually.  Like most men of his\r\nclass, his look implied that he did not under-estimate his own\r\nimportance, and his tones were those of a man accustomed to command.\r\n\r\nTim Rokens was an old salt; a bluff, strong, cast-iron man, of about\r\nforty-five years of age, who had been at sea since he was a little boy,\r\nand would not have consented to live on dry land, though he had been\r\n\"offered command of a seaport town all to himself,\" as he was wont to\r\naffirm emphatically.  His visage was scarred and knotty, as if it had\r\nbeen long used to being pelted by storms--as indeed it had.  There was a\r\nscar over his left eye and down his cheek, which had been caused by a\r\nslash from the cutlass of a pirate in the China Seas; but although it\r\nadded to the rugged effect of his countenance, it did not detract from\r\nthe frank, kindly expression that invariably rested there.  Tim Rokens\r\nhad never been caught out of temper in his life.  Men were wont say he\r\nhad no temper to lose.  Whether this was true or no, we cannot presume\r\nto say, but certainly he never lost it.  He was the best and boldest\r\nharpooner in Captain Dunning's ship, and a sententious deliverer of his\r\nprivate opinion on all occasions whatsoever.  When we say that he wore a\r\nrough blue pilot-cloth suit, and had a large black beard, with a\r\nsprinkling of silver hairs in it, we have completed his portrait.\r\n\r\n\"What's come of Glynn?\" inquired Captain Dunning, as he accepted a large\r\ncup of smoking tea with one hand, and with the other handed a plate of\r\nbuttered toast to Dr Hopley, who sat next him.\r\n\r\n\"I really cannot imagine,\" replied Miss Martha.\r\n\r\n\"No, cannot imagine,\" whispered Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\"He promised to come, and to be punctual,\" continued Miss Martha\r\n(\"Punctual,\" whispered Miss J), \"but something seems to have detained\r\nhim.  Perhaps--\"\r\n\r\nHere Miss Martha was brought to an abrupt pause by observing that Mr\r\nRokens was about to commence to eat his egg with a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, Mr Rokens,\" she said, handing that individual an ivory\r\neggspoon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, cer'nly, ma'am.  By all means,\" replied Rokens, taking the spoon\r\nand handing it to Miss Jane, under the impression that it was intended\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon, it is for yourself, Mr Rokens,\" said Martha and Jane\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"Thank'ee, ma'am,\" replied Rokens, growing red, as he began to perceive\r\nhe was a little \"off his course\" somehow.  \"I've no occasion for _two_,\r\nan' this one suits me oncommon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you prefer big spoons to little ones, my man, don't you?\" said\r\nCaptain Dunning, coming to the rescue.  \"Let him alone, Martha, he's\r\nused to take care of himself.  Doctor, can you tell me now, which is the\r\neasiest of digestion--a hard egg or a soft one?\"\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, Dr Hopley paused a moment and frowned at the teapot,\r\nas though he were about to tax his brain to the utmost in the solution\r\nof an abstruse question in medical science.\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" he replied, stirring his tea gently, and speaking with much\r\ndeliberation, \"that depends very much upon circumstances.  Some\r\ndigestions can manage a hard egg best, others find a soft one more\r\ntractable.  And then the state of the stomach at the time of eating has\r\nto be taken into account.  I should say now, that my little friend\r\nAilie, here, to judge from the rosy colour of her cheeks, could manage\r\nhard or soft eggs equally well; couldn't you, eh?\"\r\n\r\nAilie laughed, as she replied, \"I'm sure I don't know, Doctor Hopley;\r\nbut I _like_ soft ones best.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, Captain Dunning said, \"Of course you do, my sensible little\r\npet;\" although it would be difficult to show wherein lay the sensibility\r\nof the preference, and then added--\"There's Rokens, now; wouldn't you,\r\ndoctor--judging from his rosy, not to say purple cheeks--conclude that\r\nhe wasn't able to manage even two eggs of any kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot, _me_!\" exclaimed Mr Rokens, looking up in surprise, as indeed he\r\nwell might, having just concluded his fourth, and being about to\r\ncommence his fifth egg, to the no small anxiety of Martha and Jane, into\r\nwhose limited and innocent minds the possibility of such a feat had\r\nnever entered.  \"Wot, _me_!  Why, capting, if they was biled as hard as\r\nthe head of a marline-spike--\"\r\n\r\nThe expanding grin on the captain's face, and a sudden laugh from the\r\nmate, apprised the bold harpooner at this point of his reply that the\r\ncaptain was jesting, so he felt a little confused, and sought relief by\r\ndevoting himself assiduously to egg Number 5.\r\n\r\nIt fared ill with Tim Rokens that evening that he had rashly entered\r\ninto ladies' society, for he was a nervous man in refined company,\r\nthough cool and firm as a grounded iceberg when in the society of his\r\nmessmates, or when towing with the speed of a steamboat in the wake of a\r\nsperm-whale.\r\n\r\nEgg Number 5 proved to be a bad one.  Worse than that, egg Number 5\r\nhappened to belong to that peculiar class of bad eggs which \"go off\"\r\nwith a little crack when hit with a spoon, and sputter their unsavoury\r\ncontents around them.  Thus it happened, that when Mr Rokens, feeling\r\nconfused, and seeking relief in attention to the business then in hand,\r\nhit egg Number 5 a smart blow on the top, a large portion of its\r\ncontents spurted over the fair white tablecloth, a small portion fell on\r\nMr Rokens' vest, and a minute yellow globule thereof alighted on the\r\nfair Martha's hand, eliciting from that lady a scream, and as a matter\r\nof course, an echo from Jane in the shape of a screamlet.\r\n\r\nMr Rokens flushed a deep Indian-red, and his nose assumed a warm blue\r\ncolour instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! ma'am, I ax yer parding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't mention it--a mere accident.  I'm so sorry you have got a\r\nbad--Oh!\"\r\n\r\nThe little scream with which Miss Martha interrupted her remark was\r\ncaused by Mr Rokens (who had just observed the little yellow globule\r\nabove referred to) seizing her hand, and wiping away the speck with the\r\nidentical handkerchief that had floored the cat and swept away the pat\r\nof butter.  Immediately thereafter, feeling heated, he wiped the\r\nperspiration from his forehead, and unwittingly transferred the spot\r\nthereto in the form of a yellow streak, whereat Ailie and the first mate\r\nburst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.  Even Miss Martha smiled,\r\nalthough she rather objected to jesting, as being a dangerous amusement,\r\nand never laughed at the weaknesses or misfortunes of others, however\r\nludicrous they might be, when she could help it.\r\n\r\n\"How can you, brother?\" she said, reproachfully, shaking her head at the\r\ncaptain, who was winking at the doctor with one eye in a most\r\nobstreperous manner.  \"Do try another egg, Mr Rokens; the others, I am\r\nsure, are fresh.  I cannot imagine how a bad one came to be amongst\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, try another, my lad,\" echoed the captain.  \"Pass 'em up this way,\r\nMr Millons.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no manner o' means; I'll eat this 'un!\" replied the harpooner,\r\ncommencing to eat the bad egg with apparent relish.  \"I like 'em this\r\nway--better than nothin', anyhow.  Bless ye, marm, ye've no notion wot\r\nsort o' things I've lived on aboard ship--\"\r\n\r\nRokens came to an abrupt pause in consequence of the servant-girl, at a\r\nsign from her mistresses (for she always received duplicate orders),\r\nseizing his plate and carrying it off bodily.  It was immediately\r\nreplaced by a clean one and a fresh egg.  While Rokens somewhat\r\nnervously tapped the head of Number 6, Miss Martha, in order to divert\r\nattention from him, asked Mr Millons if sea-fare was always salt junk\r\nand hard biscuit?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, madam,\" answered the first mate.  \"We've sometimes salt pork,\r\nand vegetables now and agin; and pea-soup, and plum-duff--\"\r\n\r\n\"Plum-duff, Ailie,\" interrupted the captain, in order to explain, \"is\r\njust a puddin' with few plums and fewer spices in it.  Something like a\r\nwhite-painted cannon-shot, with brown spots on it here and there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it good?\" inquired Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ain't it!\" remarked Mr Rokens, who had just concluded Number 6,\r\nand felt his self-possession somewhat restored.  \"Yes, miss, it is; but\r\nit ain't equal to whale's-brain fritters, it ain't; them's first-chop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have whales got brains?\" inquired Miss Martha, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Brains!\" echoed Miss Jane, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, they 'ave,\" answered the first mate, who had hitherto\r\nmaintained silence, but having finished tea was now ready for any amount\r\nof talk; \"and what's more remarkable still, they've got several barrels\r\nof oil in their skulls besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed the sisters.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ladies, capital oil it is, too; fetches a 'igher price hin the\r\nmarkit than the other sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, Millons, didn't you once fall into a whale's skull, and get\r\nnearly drowned in oil?\" inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" answered the first mate, with the air of a man who regarded\r\nsuch an event as a mere trifle, that, upon consideration, might almost\r\nbe considered as rather a pleasant incident than otherwise in one's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly drowned in oil!\" exclaimed the sisters, while Ailie opened her\r\neyes in amazement, and Mr Rokens became alarmingly purple in the face\r\nwith suppressed chuckling.\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" remarked Rokens, in a hoarse whisper to Miss Martha,\r\nputting his hand up to his mouth, the better to convey the sound to her\r\nears; \"I seed him tumble in, and helped to haul him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have the story, Millons,\" cried the captain, pushing forward his\r\ncup to be replenished; \"It's so long since I heard it, that I've almost\r\nforgotten it.  Another cup o' tea, Martha, my dear--not quite so strong\r\nas the last, and three times as sweet.  I'll drink `Success to the cup\r\nthat cheers, but don't inebriate.'  Go ahead, Millons.\"\r\n\r\nNothing rejoiced the heart of Mr Millons more than being asked to tell\r\na story.  Like most men who are excessively addicted to the habit, his\r\nstories were usually very long and very dry; but he had a bluff\r\ngood-natured way of telling them, that rendered his yarns endurable on\r\nshore, and positively desirable at sea.  Fortunately for the reader, the\r\nstory he was now requested to relate was not a long one.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't quite a _story_,\" he began--and in beginning he cleared his\r\nthroat with emphasis, thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his vest,\r\nand tilted his chair on its hind-legs--\"it ain't quite a story; it's a\r\nhanecdote, a sort of hincident, so to speak, and this is 'ow it\r\n'appened:--\r\n\r\n\"Many years ago, w'en I was a very young man, or a big boy, I was on a\r\nvoyage to the South Seas after whales.  Tim Rokens was my messmate then,\r\nand has bin so almost ever since, off, and on.\"  (Mr Rokens nodded\r\nassent to this statement.) \"Well, we came up with a big whale, and fixed\r\nan iron cleverly in him at the first throw--\"\r\n\r\n\"An iron?\" inquired Miss Martha, to whose mind flat and Italian irons\r\nnaturally occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, an iron; we call the 'arpoons irons.  Well, away went the\r\nfish, like all alive! not down, but straight for'ard, takin' out the\r\nline at a rate that nearly set the boat on fire, and away we went along\r\nwith it.  It _was_ a chase, that.  For six hours, off and on, we stuck\r\nto that whale, and pitched into 'im with 'arpoons and lances; but he\r\nseemed to have the lives of a cat--nothin' would kill 'im.  At last the\r\n'arpooner gave him a thrust in the life, an' up went the blood and\r\nwater, and the fish went into the flurries, and came nigh capsizin' the\r\nboat with its tail as it lashed the water into foam.  At last it gave\r\nin, and we had a four hours' pull after that, to tow the carcase to the\r\nship, for there wasn't a cat's-paw of wind on the water.\r\n\r\n\"W'en we came alongside, we got out the tackles, and before beginning to\r\nflense (that means, ma'am, to strip off the blubber), we cut a hole in\r\nthe top o' the skull to get out the oil that was there; for you must\r\nknow that the sperm-whale has got a sort of 'ollow or big cavern in its\r\n'ead, w'ich is full o' the best oil, quite pure, that don't need to be\r\ncleared, but is all ready to be baled out and stowed away in casks.\r\nWell, w'en the 'ole was cut in its skull I went down on my knees on the\r\nedge of it to peep in, when my knees they slipped on the blubber, and in\r\nI went 'ead-foremost, souse into the whale's skull, and began to swim\r\nfor life in the oil.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I began to roar for 'elp like a bull, and Rokens there, 'oo\r\n'appened to be near, 'e let down the hend of a rope, but my 'ands was so\r\nslippy with oil I couldn't ketch 'old of it; so 'e 'auls it up agin, and\r\nlets down a rope with a 'ook at the hend, and I got 'old of this and\r\nstuck it into the waistband o' my trousers, and gave the word, `'Eave\r\naway, my 'earties;' and sure enough so they did, and pulled me out in a\r\ntrice.  And that's 'ow it was; and I lost a suit o' clo's, for nothing\r\non 'arth would take the oil out, and I didn't need to use pomatum for\r\nsix months after.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more you did,\" cried Rokens, who had listened to the narrative with\r\nsuppressed delight; \"no more you did.  I never see sich a glazed rat as\r\nyou wos when you comed out o' that hole, in all my life; an' he wos jist\r\nlike a eel; it wos all we could do to keep 'old on 'im, marm, he was so\r\nslippery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the captain was laughing at the incident, and Rokens was narrating\r\nsome of the minute details in the half-unwilling yet half-willing ears\r\nof the sisters, the door opened, and a young man entered hastily and\r\napologised for being late.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Miss Dunning, had I not promised faithfully to come, I\r\nshould not have made my appearance at all to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Glynn, what has kept you, lad?\" interrupted the captain.  \"I\r\nthought you were a man of your word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's the question, capting,\" said Rokens, who evidently regarded\r\nthe new arrival with no favourable feelings; \"it's always the way with\r\nthem _gentlemen_ sailors till they're got into blue water and brought to\r\ntheir bearin's.\"\r\n\r\nMr Rokens had wisdom enough to give forth the last part of his speech\r\nin a muttered tone, for the youth was evidently a favourite with the\r\ncaptain, as was shown by the hearty manner in which he shook him by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Messmates, this is Glynn Proctor, a friend o' mine,\" said Captain\r\nDunning, in explanation: \"he is going with us this voyage _before_ the\r\nmast, so you'll have to make the most of him as an equal to-night, for I\r\nintend to keep him in his proper place when afloat.  He chooses to go as\r\nan ordinary seaman, against my advice, the scamp; so I'll make him keep\r\nhis head as low as the rest when aboard.  You'll to keep your time\r\nbetter, too, than you have done to-night, lad,\" continued the captain,\r\ngiving his young friend a slap on the shoulder.  \"What has detained you,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Necessity, captain,\" replied the youth, with a smile, as he sat down to\r\ntable with an off-hand easy air that savoured of recklessness; \"and I am\r\nprepared to state, upon oath if need be, that necessity is not `the\r\nmother of invention.'  If she had been, she would have enabled me to\r\ninvent a way of escape from my persecutors in time to keep my promise to\r\nMiss Dunning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Persecutors, Glynn!\" exclaimed Martha; \"to whom do you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the police of this good city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Police!\" echoed the captain, regarding his young friend seriously,\r\nwhile the doctor and the first mate and Tim Rokens listened in some\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the fact is,\" said Glynn, \"that I have just escaped from the hands\r\nof the police, and if it had not been that I was obliged to make a very\r\nwide detour, in order to reach this house without being observed, I\r\nshould have been here long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, boy, your hasty disposition will bring you into serious trouble\r\none of these days,\" said the captain, shaking his head.  \"What mischief\r\nhave you been about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, there you go--it's my usual fate,\" cried Glynn, laughing.  \"If I\r\nchance to get into a scrape, you never think of inquiring whether it was\r\nmy fault or my misfortune.  This time, however, it _was_ my misfortune,\r\nand if Miss Dunning will oblige me with a cup of tea, I'll explain how\r\nit happened.\r\n\r\n\"Little more than two hours ago I left the ship to come here to tea, as\r\nI had promised to do.  Nikel Sling, the long-legged cook you engaged\r\nthis morning, went ashore with me.  As we walked up the street together,\r\nI observed a big porter passing along with a heavy deal plank on his\r\nshoulder.  The street was somewhat narrow and crowded at that part, and\r\nSling had turned to look in at a shop-window just as the big fellow came\r\nup.  The man shouted to my shipmate to get out o' the way, but the noise\r\nin the street prevented him from hearing.  Before I could turn to touch\r\nthe cook's arm, the fellow uttered an oath and ran the end of the plank\r\nagainst his head.  Poor Sling was down in an instant.  Before I well\r\nknew what I was about, I hit the porter between the eyes and down he\r\nwent with a clatter, and the plank above him.  In a moment three\r\npolicemen had me by the collar.  I tried to explain, but they wouldn't\r\nlisten.  As I was being hurried away to the lock-up, it flashed across\r\nme that I should not only lose my tea and your pleasant society this\r\nevening, but be prevented from sailing to-morrow, so I gave a sudden\r\ntwist, tripped up the man on my left, overturned the one on my right,\r\nand bolted.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ran well, the rascals, and shouted like maniacs, but I got the\r\nstart of 'em, dived down one street, up another, into a by-lane, over a\r\nback-garden wall, in at the back-door of a house and out at the front,\r\ntook a round of two or three miles, and came in here from the west; and\r\nwhatever other objections there may be to the whole proceeding, I cannot\r\nsay that it has spoiled my appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so, sir,\" said Captain Dunning, \"you call this your `misfortune?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, captain,\" said Glynn, putting down his cup and looking up in\r\nsome surprise--\"surely, you cannot blame me for punishing the rascal who\r\nbehaved so brutally, without the slightest provocation, to my shipmate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried Rokens involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"I do blame you, lad,\" replied the captain seriously.  \"In the first\r\nplace, you had no right to take the law into your own hands.  In the\r\nsecond place, your knocking down the man did no good whatever to your\r\nshipmate; and in the third place, you've got yourself and me and the\r\nship into a very unsatisfactory scrape.\"\r\n\r\nRokens' face, which had hitherto expressed approval of Glynn's conduct,\r\nbegan to elongate as the captain went on in this strain; and the youth's\r\nrecklessness of manner altogether disappeared as inquired, \"How so,\r\ncaptain?  I have escaped, as you see; and poor Sling, of course, was not\r\nto blame, so he'll be all safe aboard, and well, I hope, by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you're mistaken, boy.  They will have secured Sling and made him\r\ntell the name of his ship, and also the name of his pugnacious comrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you think he'd be so mean as to tell?\" asked Glynn indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"You forget that the _first_ act in this nice little melodrama was the\r\nknocking down of Sling, so that he could not know what happened after,\r\nand the police would not be so soft as to tell him _why_ they wanted\r\nsuch information until after they had got it.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Glynn looked aghast, and Rokens was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, I'd better go and see about this,\" said Millons, rising\r\nand buttoning his coat with the air of a man who had business to\r\ntransact and meant to transact it.\r\n\r\n\"Right, Millons,\" answered the captain.  \"I'm sorry to break up our\r\nevening so soon, but we must get this man aboard by hook or crook as\r\nspeedily as possible.  You had better go too, doctor.  Rokens and I will\r\ntake care of this young scamp, who must be made a nigger of in order to\r\nbe got on board, for his face, once seen by these sharp limbs of\r\njustice, is not likely soon to be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn Proctor was indeed a youth whose personal appearance was\r\ncalculated to make a lasting impression on most people.  He was about\r\neighteen years of age, but a strong, well-developed muscular frame, a\r\nfirm mouth, a large chin, and an eagle eye, gave him the appearance of\r\nbeing much older.  He was above the middle height, but not tall, and the\r\ngreat breadth of his shoulders and depth of his chest made him appear\r\nshorter than he really was.  His hair was of that beautiful hue called\r\nnut-brown, and curled close round his well-shaped head.  He was a model\r\nof strength and activity.\r\n\r\nGlynn Proctor had many faults.  He was hasty and reckless.  He was\r\nunsteady, too, and preferred a roving idle life to a busy one; but he\r\nhad redeeming qualities.  He was bold and generous.  Above all, he was\r\nunselfish, and therefore speedily became a favourite with all who knew\r\nhim.  Glynn's history is briefly told.  He was an Englishman.  His\r\nfather and mother had died when he was a child, and left him in charge\r\nof an uncle, who emigrated to America shortly after his brother's death.\r\nThe uncle was a good man, after a fashion, but he was austere and\r\nunlovable.  Glynn didn't like him; so when he attained the age of\r\nthirteen, he quietly told him that he meant to bid him good-bye, and go\r\nseek his fortune in the world.  The uncle as quietly told Glynn that he\r\nwas quite right, and the sooner he went the better.  So Glynn went, and\r\nnever saw his uncle again, for the old man died while he was abroad.\r\n\r\nGlynn travelled far and encountered many vicissitudes of fortune in his\r\nearly wanderings; but he was never long without occupation, because men\r\nliked his looks, and took him on trial without much persuasion.  To say\r\ntruth, Glynn never took the trouble to persuade them.  When his services\r\nwere declined, he was wont to turn on his heel and walk away without a\r\nword of reply; and not unfrequently he was called back and employed.  He\r\ncould turn his hand to almost anything, but when he tired of it, he\r\nthrew it up and sought other work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his peregrinations, he came to reside in the city in\r\nwhich our story finds him.  Here he had become a compositor in the\r\noffice of a daily newspaper, and, happening to be introduced to the\r\nMisses Dunning, soon became a favourite with them, and a constant\r\nvisitor at their house.  Thus he became acquainted with their brother.\r\nBecoming disgusted with the constant work and late hours of the\r\nprinting-office, he resolved to join Captain Dunning's ship, and take a\r\nvoyage to southern seas as an ordinary seaman.  Glynn and little Alice\r\nDunning were great friends, and it was a matter of extreme delight to\r\nboth of them that they were to sail together on this their first voyage.\r\n\r\nHaving been made a nigger of--that is, having had his face and hands\r\nblackened in order to avoid detection--Glynn sallied forth with the\r\ncaptain and Rokens to return to their ship, the _Red Eric_, which lay in\r\nthe harbour, not ten minutes' walk from the house.\r\n\r\nThey passed the police on the wharf without creating suspicion, and\r\nreached the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Millons, what news?\" inquired the captain, as he stepped on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Bad news, sir, I fear\" replied the first mate.  \"I found, on coming\r\naboard, that no one knew anything about Sling, so I went ashore at once\r\nand 'urried up to the hospital, w'ere, sure enough, I found 'im lyin'\r\nwith his 'ead bandaged, and lookin' as if 'e were about gone.  They\r\nasked me if I knew what ship 'e belonged to, as the police wanted to\r\nknow.  So I told 'em I knew well enough, but I wasn't going to tell if\r\nit would get the poor fellow into a scrape.\r\n\r\n\"`Why don't you ask himself?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"They told me 'e was past speaking, so I tried to make 'im understand,\r\nbut 'e only mumbled in reply.  W'en I was about to go 'e seemed to\r\nmumble very 'ard, so I put down my ear to listen, and 'e w'ispered quite\r\ndistinct tho' very low--`All right, my 'eartie.  I'm too cute for 'em by\r\na long way; go aboard an' say nothin'.'  So I came away, and I've scarce\r\nbeen five minutes aboard before you arrived.  My own opinion is, that\r\n'e's crazed, and don't know what 'e's sayin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated Captain Dunning.  \"He said that, did he?  Then _my_\r\nopinion is, that he's not so crazed as you think.  Tell the watch, Mr\r\nMillons, to keep a sharp look-out.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Captain Dunning descended to the cabin, and Rokens to the\r\nforecastle (in sea phraseology the \"fok-sail\"), while Glynn Proctor\r\nprocured a basin and a piece of soap, and proceeded to rub the coat of\r\ncharcoal off his face and hands.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour had not elapsed when the watch on deck heard a loud splash\r\nnear the wharf, as if some one had fallen into the water.  Immediately\r\nafter, a confused sound of voices and rapid footsteps was heard in the\r\nstreet that opened out upon the quay, and in a few seconds the end of\r\nthe wharf was crowded with men who shouted to each other, and were seen\r\nin the dim starlight to move rapidly about as if in search of something.\r\n\r\n\"Wot can it be?\" said Tim Rokens in a low voice, to a seaman who leaned\r\non the ship's bulwarks close to him.\r\n\r\n\"Deserter, mayhap,\" suggested the man.\r\n\r\nWhile Rokens pondered the suggestion, a light plash was heard close to\r\nthe ship's side, and a voice said, in a hoarse whisper, \"Heave us a\r\nrope, will ye.  Look alive, now.  Guess I'll go under in two minits if\r\nye don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" exclaimed Rokens, in a low, impressive voice, as he threw over\r\nthe end of a rope, and, with the aid of the other members of the watch,\r\nhauled Nikel Sling up the side, and landed him dripping and panting on\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n\"W'y--Sling! what on airth--?\" exclaimed one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky--I am--on airth--\" panted the tall cook, seating himself on\r\nthe breech of one of the main-deck carronades, and wringing the water\r\nfrom his garments.  \"An' it's well I'm not at the bottom o' this 'ere\r\n'arbour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where did ye come from, an' why are they arter ye, lad?\" inquired\r\nRokens.\r\n\r\n\"W'y? 'cause they don't want to part with me, and I've gi'n them the\r\nslip, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Nikel Sling had recovered himself so as to talk connectedly, he\r\nexplained to his wondering shipmates how that, after being floored in\r\nthe street, he had been carried up to the hospital, and on recovering\r\nhis senses, found Mr Millons standing by the bedside, conversing with\r\nthe young surgeons.  The first words of their conversation showed him\r\nthat something was wrong, so, with remarkable self-possession, he\r\nresolved to counterfeit partial delirium, by which means he contrived to\r\ngive the first mate a hint that all was right, and declined, without\r\ncreating suspicion, to give any intelligible answers as to who he was or\r\nwhere he had come from.\r\n\r\nThe blow on his head caused him considerable pain, but his mind was\r\nrelieved by one of the young surgeons, who remarked to another, in going\r\nround the wards, that the \"skull of that long chap wasn't fractured\r\nafter all, and he had no doubt he would be dismissed cured in a day or\r\ntwo.\"  So the cook lay quiet until it was dark.\r\n\r\nWhen the house-surgeon had paid his last visit, and the nurses had gone\r\ntheir rounds in the accident-ward, and no sound disturbed the quiet of\r\nthe dimly-lighted apartment save the heavy fitful breathing and\r\noccasional moans and restless motions of the sufferers, Nikel Sling\r\nraised himself on his elbow, and glanced stealthily round on the rows of\r\npain-worn and haggard countenances around him.  It was a solemn sight to\r\nlook upon, especially at that silent hour of the night.  There were men\r\nthere with almost every species of painful wound and fracture.  Some had\r\nbeen long there, wasting away from day to day, and now lay quiet, though\r\nsuffering, from sheer exhaustion.  Others there were who had been\r\ncarried in that day, and fidgeted impatiently in their unreduced\r\nstrength, yet nervously in their agony; or, in some cases, where the\r\nfear of death was on them, clasped their hands and prayed in whispers\r\nfor mercy to Him whose name perhaps they had almost never used before\r\nexcept for the purpose of taking it in vain.\r\n\r\nBut such sights had little or no effect on the cook, who had rubbed hard\r\nagainst the world's roughest sides too long to be easily affected by the\r\nsight of human suffering, especially when exhibited in men.  He paused\r\nlong enough to note that the nurses were out of the way or dozing, and\r\nthen slipping out of bed, he stalked across the room like a ghost, and\r\nmade for the outer gateway of the hospital.  He knew the way, having\r\nonce before been a temporary inmate of the place.  He reached the gate\r\nundiscovered, tripped up the porter's heels, opened the wicket, and fled\r\ntowards the harbour, followed by the porter and a knot of chance\r\npassers-by.  The pursuers swelled into a crowd as he neared the harbour.\r\n\r\nBesides being long-limbed, Nikel Sling was nimble.  He distanced his\r\npursuers easily, and, as we have seen, swam off and reached his ship\r\nalmost as soon as they gained the end of the wharf.\r\n\r\nThe above narration was made much more abruptly and shortly than we have\r\npresented it, for oars were soon heard in the water, and it behoved the\r\npoor hunted cook to secrete himself in case they should take a fancy to\r\nsearch the vessel.  Just as the boat came within a few yards of the ship\r\nhe hastily went below.\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\" shouted Tim Rokens; \"wot boat's that?\"\r\n\r\nThe men lay on their oars.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a madman on board your ship?\" inquired the gatekeeper of the\r\nhospital, whose wrath at the unceremonious treatment he had received had\r\nnot yet cooled down.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Rokens, laying his arms on the bulwarks, and looking down\r\nat his questioner with a sly leer; \"no, we ha'n't, but you've got a\r\nmadman aboord that boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" inquired the warder, who did not at first understand the\r\nsarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yourself, to be sure,\" replied Rokens, \"an' the sooner you takes\r\nyourself off, an' comes to an anchor in a loo-natick asylum, the better\r\nfor all parties consarned.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I'm in earnest, my man--\"\r\n\r\n\"_As_ far as that goes,\" interrupted the imperturbable Rokens, \"so am\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man,\" continued the gatekeeper, \"has run out of the hospital with a\r\nsmashed head, I calc'late, stark starin' mad, and gone off the end o'\r\nthe w'arf into the water--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" shouted Rokens, starting with affected surprise.\r\n\"Now you _are_ a fine fellow, ain't you, to be talkin' here an' wastin'\r\ntime while a poor feller-mortal is bein' drownded, or has gone and\r\nswummed off to sea--p'r'aps without chart, compass, or rudder!  Hallo,\r\nlads! tumble up there!  Man overboard! tumble up, tumble up!\"\r\n\r\nIn less than three minutes half-a-dozen men sprang up the hatchway,\r\nhauled up the gig which swung astern, tumbled into it, and began to pull\r\nwildly about the harbour in search of the drowning man.  The shouts and\r\ncommotion roused the crews of the nearest vessels, and ere long quite a\r\nfleet of boats joined in the search.\r\n\r\n\"Wos he a big or a little feller?\" inquired Rokens, panting from his\r\nexertions, as he swept up to the boat containing the hospital warder,\r\nround which several of the other boats began to congregate.\r\n\r\n\"A big fellow, I guess, with legs like steeples.  He was sloping when\r\nthey floored him.  A thief, I expect he must ha' bin.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thief!\" echoed Rokens, in disgust; \"why didn't ye say, so at first?\r\nIf he's a thief, he's born to be hanged, so he's safe and snug aboard\r\nhis ship long ago, I'll be bound.  Good-night t'ye, friend, and better\r\nluck next time.\"\r\n\r\nA loud laugh greeted the ears of the discomfited warder as the crews of\r\nthe boats dipped their oars in the water and pulled towards, their\r\nrespective ships.\r\n\r\nNext morning, about daybreak, little Alice Dunning came on board her\r\nfather's ship, accompanied by her two aunts, who, for once, became\r\nutterly and publicly regardless of appearances and contemptuous of all\r\npropriety, as they sobbed on the child's neck and positively refused to\r\nbe comforted.\r\n\r\nJust as the sun rose, and edged the horizon with a gleam of liquid fire,\r\nthe _Red Eric_ spread her sails and stood out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nDAY DREAMS AND ADVENTURES AMONG THE CLOUDS--A CHASE, A BATTLE, AND A\r\nVICTORY.\r\n\r\nEarly morning on the ocean!  There is poetry in the idea; there is music\r\nin the very sound.  As there is nothing new under the sun, probably a\r\nsong exists with this or a similar title; if not, we now recommend it\r\nearnestly to musicians.\r\n\r\nAilie Dunning sat on the bulwarks of the _Red Eric_, holding on tightly\r\nby the mizzen-shrouds, and gazing in open-eyed, open-mouthed,\r\ninexpressible delight upon the bright calm sea.  She was far, far out\r\nupon the bosom of the Atlantic now.  Sea-sickness--which during the\r\nfirst part of the voyage, had changed the warm pink of her pretty face\r\ninto every imaginable shade of green--was gone, and the hue of health\r\ncould not now be banished even by the rudest storm.  In short, she had\r\nbecome a thorough sailor, and took special delight in turning her face\r\nto windward during the wild storm, and drinking-in the howling blast as\r\nshe held on by the rigid shrouds, and laughed at the dashing spray--for\r\nlittle Ailie was not easily frightened.  Martha and Jane Dunning had\r\nmade it their first care to implant in the heart of their charge a\r\nknowledge of our Saviour's love, and especially of His tenderness\r\ntowards, and watchful care over, the lambs of His flock.  Besides this,\r\nlittle Ailie was naturally of a trustful disposition.  She had implicit\r\nconfidence in the strength and wisdom of her father, and it never\r\nentered into her imagination to dream that it was possible for any evil\r\nto befall the ship which _he_ commanded.\r\n\r\nBut, although Ailie delighted in the storm, she infinitely preferred the\r\ntranquil beauty and rest of a \"great calm,\" especially at the hour just\r\nbefore sunrise, when the freshness, brightness, and lightness of the\r\nyoung day harmonised peculiarly with her elastic spirit.  It was at this\r\nhour that we find her alone upon the bulwarks of the _Red Eric_.\r\n\r\nThere was a deep, solemn stillness around, that irresistibly and\r\npowerfully conveyed to her mind the idea of rest.  The long, gentle\r\nundulation of the deep did not in the least detract from this idea.  So\r\nperfect was the calm, that several masses of clouds in the sky, which\r\nshone with the richest saffron light, were mirrored in all their rich\r\ndetails as if in a glass.  The faintest possible idea of a line alone\r\nindicated, in one direction, where the water terminated and the sky\r\nbegan.  A warm golden haze suffused the whole atmosphere, and softened\r\nthe intensity of the deep-blue vault above.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, little variety of object to gaze upon--only the water\r\nand the sky.  But what a world of delight did not Ailie find in that\r\nvast sky and that pure ocean, that reminded her of the sea of glass\r\nbefore the great white throne, of which she had so often read in\r\nRevelation.  The towering masses of clouds were so rich and thick, that\r\nshe almost fancied them to be mountains and valleys, rocks and plains of\r\ngolden snow.  Nay, she looked so long and so ardently at the rolling\r\nmountain heights in the sky above, and their magical counterparts in the\r\nsky below, that she soon, as it were, _thought herself into_ Fairyland,\r\nand began a regular journey of adventures therein.\r\n\r\nSuch a scene at such an hour is a source of gladsome, peaceful delight\r\nto the breast of man in every stage of life; but it is a source of\r\nunalloyed, bounding, exhilarating, romantic, unspeakable joy only in the\r\nyears of childhood, when the mind looks hopefully forward, and before it\r\nhas begun--as, alas! it must begin, sooner or later--to gaze regretfully\r\nback.\r\n\r\nHow long Ailie would have sat in motionless delight it is difficult to\r\nsay.  The man at the wheel having nothing to do, had forsaken his post,\r\nand was leaning over the stern, either lost in reverie, or in a vain\r\neffort to penetrate with his vision the blue abyss to the bottom.  The\r\nmembers of the watch on deck were either similarly engaged or had stowed\r\nthemselves away to sleep in quiet corners among blocks and cordage.  No\r\none seemed inclined to move or speak, and she would probably have sat\r\nthere immovable for hours to come, had not a hand fallen gently on her\r\nshoulder, and by the magic of its simple contact scattered the bright\r\ndreams of Fairyland as the finger-touch destroys the splendour of the\r\nsoap-bubble.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Glynn,\" exclaimed Ailie, looking round and heaving a deep sigh;\r\n\"I've been away--far, far away--you can't believe how far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away, Ailie!  Where have you been?\" asked Glynn, patting the child's\r\nhead as he leaned over the gunwale beside her.\r\n\r\n\"In Fairyland.  Up in the clouds yonder.  Out and in, and up and down.\r\nOh, you've no idea.  Just look.\"  She pointed eagerly to an immense\r\ntowering cloud that rose like a conspicuous landmark in the centre of\r\nthe landscape of the airy world above.  \"Do you see that mountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Ailie; the one in the middle, you mean, don't you?  Yes, well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued the child, eagerly and hurriedly, as if she feared to\r\nlose the thread of memory that formed the warp and woof of the delicate\r\nfabric she had been engaged in weaving; \"well, I began there; I went in\r\nbehind it, and I met a fairy--not really, you know, but I tried to think\r\nI met one, so I began to speak to her, and then I made her speak to me,\r\nand her voice was so small and soft and sweet.  She had on silver wings,\r\nand a star--a bright star in her forehead--and she carried a wand with a\r\nstar on the top of it too.  So I asked her to take me to see her\r\nkingdom, and I made her say she would--and, do you know, Glynn, I really\r\nfelt at last as if she didn't wait for me to tell her what to say, but\r\njust went straight on, answering my questions, and putting questions to\r\nme in return.  Wasn't it funny?\r\n\r\n\"Well, we went on, and on, and on--the fairy and me--up one beautiful\r\nmountain of snow and down another, talking all the time so pleasantly,\r\nuntil we came to a great dark cave; so I made up my mind to make a lion\r\ncome out of it; but the fairy said, `No, let it be a bear;' and\r\nimmediately a great bear came out.  Wasn't it strange?  It really seemed\r\nas if the fairy had become real, and could do things of her own accord.\"\r\n\r\nThe child paused at this point, and looking with an expression of awe\r\ninto her companion's face, said--\"Do you think, Glynn, that people can\r\n_think_ so hard that fairies _really_ come to them?\"\r\n\r\nGlynn looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"No, Ailie, I suspect they can't--not because we can't think hard\r\nenough, but because there are no fairies to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm _so_ sorry!\" replied the child sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" inquired Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Because I love them _so_ much--of course, I mean the good ones.  I\r\ndon't like the bad ones--though they're very useful, because they're\r\nnice to kill, and punish, and make examples of, and all that, when the\r\ngood ones catch them.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they are,\" said the youth, smiling.  \"I never thought of that\r\nbefore.  But go on with your ramble in the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" began Ailie; \"but where was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just going to be introduced to a bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; well--the bear walked slowly away, and then the fairy called\r\nout an elephant, and after that a 'noceros--\"\r\n\r\n\"A 'noceros!\" interrupted Glynn; \"what's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know very well.  A beast with a thick skin hanging in folds,\r\nand a horn on its nose--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, a _rhi_noceros--I see.  Well, go on, Ailie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the fairy told a camel to appear, and after that a monkey, and\r\nthen a hippopotamus, and they all came out one after another, and some\r\nof them went away, and others began to fight.  But the strangest thing\r\nof all was, that every one of them was _so_ like the pictures of wild\r\nbeasts that are hanging in my room at home!  The elephant, too, I\r\nnoticed, had his trunk broken exactly the same way as my toy elephant's\r\none was.  Wasn't it odd?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was rather odd,\" replied Glynn; \"but where did you go after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then we went on, and on again, until we came to--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your turn at the wheel, lad, ain't it?\" inquired Mr Millons,\r\ncoming up at that moment, and putting an abrupt termination to the walk\r\nin Fairyland.\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir,\" answered Glynn, springing quickly to the wheel, and\r\nrelieving the man who had been engaged in penetrating the ocean's\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThe mate walked forward; the released sailor went below, and Ailie was\r\nagain left to her solitary meditations;--for she was enough of a sailor\r\nnow, in heart, to know that she ought not to talk too much to the\r\nsteersman, even though the weather should be calm and there was no call\r\nfor his undivided attention to the duties of his post.\r\n\r\nWhile Nature was thus, as it were, asleep, and the watch on deck were\r\nmore than half in the same condition, there was one individual in the\r\nship whose faculties were in active play, whose \"steam,\" as he himself\r\nwould have remarked, \"was up.\"  This was the worthy cook, Nikel Sling,\r\nwhose duties called him to his post at the galley-fire at an early hour\r\neach day.\r\n\r\nWe have often thought that a cook's life must be one of constant\r\nself-denial and exasperation of spirit.  Besides the innumerable\r\nanxieties in reference to such important matters as boiling over and\r\nover-boiling, being done to a turn, or over-done, or singed or burned,\r\nor capsized, he has the diurnal misery of being the first human being in\r\nhis little circle of life, to turn out of a morning, and must therefore\r\nexperience the discomfort--the peculiar discomfort--of finding things as\r\n_they were left_ the night before.  Any one who does not know what that\r\ndiscomfort is, has only to rise an hour before the servants of a\r\nhousehold, whether at sea or on shore, to find out.  Cook, too, has\r\ngenerally, if not always, to light the fire; and that, especially in\r\nfrosty weather, is not agreeable.  Moreover, cook roasts _himself_ to\r\nsuch an extent, and at meal-times, in nine cases out of ten, gets into\r\nsuch physical and mental perturbation, that he cannot possibly\r\nappreciate the luxuries he has been occupied all the day in concocting.\r\nAdd to this, that he spends all the morning in preparing breakfast; all\r\nthe forenoon in preparing dinner; all the afternoon in preparing tea and\r\nsupper, and all the evening in clearing up, and perhaps all the night in\r\ndreaming of the meals of the following day, and mentally preparing\r\nbreakfast, and we think that we have clearly proved the truth of the\r\nproposition with which we started--namely, that a cook's life must be\r\none of constant self-denial and exasperation of spirit.\r\n\r\nBut this is by the way, and was merely suggested by the fact that, while\r\nall other creatures were enjoying either partial or complete repose,\r\nNikel Sling was washing out pots and pans and kettles, and handling\r\nmurderous-looking knives and two-pronged tormentors with a demoniacal\r\nactivity that was quite appalling.\r\n\r\nBeside him, on a little stool close to the galley-fire, sat Tim Rokens--\r\nnot that Mr Rokens was cold--far from it.  He was, to judge from\r\nappearances, much hotter than was agreeable.  But Tim had come there and\r\nsat down to light his pipe, and being rather phlegmatic when not\r\nactively employed, he preferred to be partially roasted for a few\r\nminutes to getting up again.\r\n\r\n\"We ought,\" remarked Tim Rokens, puffing at a little black pipe which\r\nseemed inclined to be obstinate, \"we ought to be gittin' among the fish\r\nby this time.  Many's the one I've seed in them 'ere seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather guess we should,\" replied the cook, pausing the midst of his\r\ntoils and wiping the perspiration from his forehead with an immense\r\nbundle of greasy oakum.  \"But I've seed us keep dodgin' about for weeks,\r\nI have, later in the year than this, without clappin' eyes on a fin.\r\nWhat sort o' baccy d'ye smoke, Rokens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dun know.  Got it from a Spanish smuggler for an old clasp-knife.\r\nWhy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause it smells like rotten straw, an' won't improve the victuals.\r\nGuess you'd better take yourself off, old chap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot a cross-grained crittur ye are,\" said Rokens, as he rose to depart.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was heard a cry that sent the blood tingling to the\r\nextremities of every one on board the _Red Eric_.\r\n\r\n\"Thar she blows! thar she blows!\" shouted the man in the crow's-nest.\r\n\r\nThe crow's-nest is a sort of cask, or nest, fixed at the top of the\r\nmainmast of whale-ships, in which a man is stationed all day during the\r\ntime the ships are on the fishing-ground, to look out for whales; and\r\nthe cry, \"Thar she blows,\" announced the fact that the look-out had\r\nobserved a whale rise to the surface and blow a spout of steamy water\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nNo conceivable event--unless perhaps the blowing-up of the ship itself--\r\ncould have more effectually and instantaneously dissipated the deep\r\ntranquillity to which we have more than once referred.  Had an electric\r\nshock been communicated through the ship to each individual, the crew\r\ncould not have been made to leap more vigorously and simultaneously.\r\nMany days before, they had begun to expect to see whales.  Every one was\r\ntherefore on the _qui vive_, so that when the well-known signal rang out\r\nlike a startling peal in the midst of the universal stillness, every\r\nheart in the ship leaped in unison.\r\n\r\nHad an observant man been seated at the time in the forecastle, he would\r\nhave noticed that from out of the ten or fifteen hammocks that swung\r\nfrom the beams, there suddenly darted ten or fifteen pairs of legs which\r\nrose to the perpendicular position in order to obtain leverage to \"fetch\r\nway.\"  Instantly thereafter the said legs descended, and where the feet\r\nhad been, ten or fifteen heads appeared.  Next moment the men were\r\n\"tumbling up\" the fore-hatch to the deck, where the watch had already\r\nsprung to the boat-tackles.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" sang out Captain Dunning who was among the first on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Off the weather bow, sir, three points.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far?\"\r\n\r\n\"About two miles.  Thar she blows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Call all hands,\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Starboard watch, ahoy!\" roared the mate, in that curious hoarse voice\r\npeculiar to boatswains of men-of-war.  \"Tumble up, lads, tumble up!\r\nWhale in sight!  Bear a hand, my hearties!\"\r\n\r\nThe summons was almost unnecessary.  The \"starboard watch\" was--with the\r\nexception of one or two uncommonly heavy sleepers--already on deck\r\npulling on its ducks and buckling its belts.\r\n\r\n\"Thar she breaches, thar she blows!\" again came from the crow's-nest in\r\nthe voice of a Stentor.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Dick Barnes, you're the first to raise the oil,\" remarked\r\none of the men, implying by the remark that the said Dick was fortunate\r\nenough to be the first to sight a whale.\r\n\r\n\"Where away now?\" roared the captain, who was in a state of intense\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"A mile an' a half to leeward, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear away the boats,\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Masthead, ahoy!  D'ye see that whale now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir.  Thar she blows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand, my hearties,\" cried the captain, as the men sprang to the\r\nboats which were swinging at the davits.  \"Get your tubs in!  Clear your\r\nfalls!  Look alive, lads!  Stand-by to lower!  All ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"All ready, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thar she blows!\" came again from the masthead with redoubled energy.\r\n\"Sperm-whales, sir; there's a school of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _school_ of them!\" whispered Ailie, who had left her post at the\r\nmizzen-shrouds, and now stood by her father's side, looking on at the\r\nsudden hubbub in unspeakable amazement.  \"Do whales go to school?\" she\r\nsaid, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the road, Ailie, my pet,\" cried her father hastily.  \"You'll get\r\nknocked over.  Lower away, lads, lower away!\"\r\n\r\nDown went the starboard, larboard, and waist-boats as if the falls had\r\nbeen cut, and almost before you could wink the men literally tumbled\r\nover the side into them, took their places, and seized their oars.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Glynn, come with me, and I'll show you a thing or two,\" said the\r\ncaptain.  \"Jump in, lad; look sharp.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn instantly followed his commander into the starboard boat, and took\r\nthe aft oar.  Tim Rokens, being the harpooner of that boat, sat at the\r\nbow oar with his harpoons and lances beside him, and the whale-line\r\ncoiled in a tub in the boat's head.  The captain steered.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced a race that taxed the boats' crews to the utmost; for\r\nit is always a matter keenly contested by the different crews, who shall\r\nfix the first harpoon in the whale.  The larboard boat was steered by\r\nMr Millons, the first mate; the waist-boat by Mr Markham, the second\r\nmate--the latter an active man of about five-and-twenty, whose size and\r\nphysical strength were herculean, and whose disposition was somewhat\r\nmorose and gloomy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, give way!  That's it! that's the way.  Bend your backs, now!\r\n_do_ bend your backs,\" cried the captain, as the three boats sprang from\r\nthe ship's side and made towards the nearest whale, with the white foam\r\ncurling at their bow.\r\n\r\nSeveral more whales appeared in sight spouting in all directions, and\r\nthe men were wild with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"That's it!  Go it lads!\" shouted Mr Millons, as the waist-boat began\r\nto creep ahead.  \"Lay it on! give way!  What d'ye say, boys; shall we\r\nbeat 'em?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning stood in the stern-sheets of the starboard boat, almost\r\ndancing with excitement as he heard these words of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Give way, boys!\" he cried.  \"They can't do it!  That whale's ours--so\r\nit is.  Only bend your backs!  A steady pull!  Pull like steam-tugs!\r\nThat's it!  Bend the oars!  Double 'em up!  Smash 'em in bits, _do_!\"\r\n\r\nWithout quite going the length of the captain's last piece of advice,\r\nthe men did their work nobly.  They bent their strong backs with a will,\r\nand strained their sinewy arms to the utmost.  Glynn, in particular, to\r\nwhom the work was new, and therefore peculiarly exciting and\r\ninteresting, almost tore the rowlocks out of the boat in his efforts to\r\nurge it on, and had the oar not been made of the toughest ash, there is\r\nno doubt that he would have obeyed the captain's orders literally and\r\nhave smashed it in bits.\r\n\r\nOn they flew like racehorses.  Now one boat gained an inch on the\r\nothers, then it lost ground again as the crew of another put forth\r\nadditional energy, and the three danced over the glassy sea as if the\r\ninanimate planks had been suddenly endued with life, and inspired with\r\nthe spirit that stirred the men.\r\n\r\nA large sperm-whale lay about a quarter of a mile ahead, rolling lazily\r\nin the trough of the sea.  Towards this the starboard boat now pulled\r\nwith incredible speed, leaving the other two gradually astern.  A number\r\nof whales rose in various directions.  They had got into the midst of a\r\nshoal, or school of them, as the whale-men term it; and as several of\r\nthese were nearer the other boats than the first whale was, they\r\ndiverged towards them.\r\n\r\n\"There go flukes,\" cried Rokens, as the whale raised its huge tail in\r\nthe air and \"sounded\"--in other words, dived.  For a few minutes the men\r\nlay on their oars, uncertain in what direction the whale would come up\r\nagain; but their doubts were speedily removed by its rising within a few\r\nyards of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Rokens,\" cried the captain; \"now for it; give him the iron.  Give\r\nway, lads; spring, boys.  Softly now, softly.\"\r\n\r\nIn another instant the boat's bow was on the whale's head, and Rokens\r\nburied a harpoon deep in its side.\r\n\r\n\"Stern all!\" thundered the captain.\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed, and the boat was backed off the whale just in time to\r\nescape the blow of its tremendous flukes as it dived into the sea, the\r\nblue depths of which were instantly dyed red with the blood that flowed\r\nin torrents from the wound.\r\n\r\nDown it went, carrying out the line at a rate that caused the chocks\r\nthrough which it passed to smoke.  In a few minutes the line ceased to\r\nrun out, and the whale returned to the surface.  It had scarcely showed\r\nits nose, when the slack of the line was hauled in, and a second harpoon\r\nwas fixed in its body.\r\n\r\nInfuriated with pain, the mighty fish gave vent to a roar like a bull,\r\nrolled half over, and lashed the sea with his flukes, till, all round\r\nfor many yards, it was churned into red slimy foam.  Then he turned\r\nround, and dashed off with the speed of a locomotive engine, tearing the\r\nboat through the waves behind it, the water curling up like a white wall\r\nround the bows.\r\n\r\n\"She won't stand that long,\" muttered Glynn Proctor, as he rested on his\r\noar, and looked over his shoulder at the straining line.\r\n\r\n\"That she will, boy,\" said the captain; \"and more than that, if need be.\r\nYou'll not be long of havin' a chance of greasin' your fingers, I'll\r\nwarrant.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the speed began to slacken, and after a time they were\r\nable to haul in on the line.  When the whale again came to the surface,\r\na third harpoon was cleverly struck into it, and a spout of blood from\r\nits blow-hole showed that it was mortally wounded.  In throwing the\r\nharpoon, Tim Rokens slipped his foot, and went down like a stone\r\nhead-foremost into the sea.  He came up again like a cork, and just as\r\nthe boat flew past fortunately caught hold of Glynn Proctor's hand.  It\r\nwas well that the grasp was a firm one, for the strain on their two arms\r\nwas awful.  In another minute Tim was in his place, ready with his lance\r\nto finish off the whale at its next rise.\r\n\r\nUp it came again, foaming, breaching, and plunging from wave to wave,\r\nflinging torrents of blood and spray into the air.  At one moment he\r\nreared his blunt gigantic head high above the sea; the next he buried\r\nhis vast and quivering carcase deep in the gory brine, carrying down\r\nwith him a perfect whirlpool of red foam.  Then he rose again and made\r\nstraight for the boat.  Had he known his own power, he might have soon\r\nterminated the battle, and come off the victor, but fortunately he did\r\nnot.  Tim Rokens received his blunt nose on the point of his lance, and\r\ndrove him back with mingled fury and terror.  Another advance was made,\r\nand a successful lance-thrust delivered.\r\n\r\n\"That's into his life,\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" replied Rokens.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was.  A vital part had been struck.  For some minutes the huge\r\nleviathan lashed and rolled and tossed in the trembling waves in his\r\nagony, while he spouted up gallons of blood with every throe; then he\r\nrolled over on his back, and lay extended a lifeless mass upon the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads; three cheers for our first whale.  Hip! hip! hip!--\"\r\n\r\nThe cheer that followed was given with all the energy and gusto inspired\r\nby a first victory, and it was repeated again and again, and over again,\r\nbefore the men felt themselves sufficiently relieved to commence the\r\nsomewhat severe and tedious labour of towing the carcase to the ship.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard pull, for the whale had led them a long chase, and as the\r\ncalm continued, those left aboard could not approach to meet the boats.\r\nThe exhausted men were cheered, however, on getting aboard late that\r\nnight, to find that the other boats had been equally successful, each of\r\nthem having captured a sperm-whale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nDISAGREEABLE CHANGES--SAGACIOUS CONVERSATIONS, AND A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\nA striking and by no means a pleasant change took place in the general\r\nappearance of the _Red Eric_ immediately after the successful chase\r\ndetailed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of the whales the decks had been beautifully clean\r\nand white, for Captain Dunning was proud of his ship, and fond of\r\ncleanliness and order.  A few hours after the said arrival the decks\r\nwere smeared with grease, oil, and blood, and everything from stem to\r\nstern became from that day filthy and dirty.\r\n\r\nThis was a sad change to poor Ailie, who had not imagined it possible\r\nthat so sudden and disagreeable an alteration could take place.  But\r\nthere was no help for it; the duties of the fishery in which they were\r\nengaged required that the whales should not only be caught, but cut up,\r\nboiled down to oil, and stowed away in the hold in casks.\r\n\r\nIf the scene was changed for the worse a few hours after the cutting-up\r\noperations were begun, it became infinitely more so when the _try-works_\r\nwere set going, and the melting-fires were lighted, and huge volumes of\r\nsmoke begrimed the masts, and sails, and rigging.  It was vain to think\r\nof clearing up; had they attempted that, the men would have been\r\nover-tasked without any good being accomplished.  There was only one\r\ncourse open to those who didn't like it, and that was--to \"grin and bear\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cutting out\" and \"trying in\" are the terms used by whale-men to denote\r\nthe processes of cutting off the flesh or \"blubber\" from the whale's\r\ncarcase, and reducing it to oil.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on the following morning the first of these operations\r\nwas commenced.\r\n\r\nAilie went about the decks, looking on with mingled wonder, interest,\r\nand disgust.  She stepped about gingerly, as if afraid of coming in\r\ncontact with slimy objects, and with her nose and mouth screwed up after\r\nthe fashion of those who are obliged to endure bad smells.  The\r\nexpression of her face under the circumstances was amusing.\r\n\r\nAs for the men, they went about their work with relish, and total\r\nindifference as to consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen the largest whale had been hauled alongside, ropes were attached to\r\nhis head and tail, and the former was secured near the stern of the\r\nship, while the latter was lashed to the bow; the cutting-tackle was\r\nthen attached.  This consisted of an arrangement of pulleys depending\r\nfrom the main-top, with a large blubber-hook at the end thereof.  The\r\ncutting was commenced at the neck, and the hook attached; then the men\r\nhove on the windlass, and while the cutting was continued in a spiral\r\ndirection round the whale's body, the tackle raised the mass of flesh\r\nuntil it reached the fixed blocks above.  This mass, when it could be\r\nhauled up no higher, was then cut off, and stowed away under the name of\r\na \"blanket-piece.\"  It weighed upwards of a ton.  The hook being lowered\r\nand again attached, the process was continued until the whole was cut\r\noff.  Afterwards, the head was severed from the body and hoisted on\r\nboard, in order that the oil contained in the hollow of it might be\r\nbaled out.\r\n\r\nFrom the head of the first whale ten barrels of oil were obtained.  The\r\nblubber yielded about eighty barrels.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"cutting out\" was completed, and the remnants of bone and flesh\r\nwere left to the sharks which swarmed round the vessel, revelling in\r\ntheir unusually rich banquet, the process of \"trying in\" commenced.\r\n\"Trying in\" is the term applied to the melting of the fat and the\r\nstowing of it away in barrels in the form of oil; and an uncommonly\r\ndirty process it is.  The large \"blanket-pieces\" were cut into smaller\r\nportions, and put into the try-pots, which were kept in constant\r\noperation.  At night the ship had all the appearance of a vessel on\r\nfire, and the scene on deck was particularly striking and unearthly.\r\n\r\nOne night several of the men were grouped on and around the windlass,\r\nchatting, singing, and \"spinning yarns.\"  Ailie Dunning stood near them,\r\nlost in wonder and admiration; for the ears and eyes of the child were\r\nassailed in a manner never before experienced or dreamed of even in the\r\nmost romantic mood of cloud-wandering.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night, darker than usual, and not a breath of wind\r\nruffled the sea, which was like a sheet of undulating glass--for, be it\r\nremembered, there is no such thing at any time as absolute stillness in\r\nthe ocean.  At all times, even in the profoundest calm, the long, slow,\r\ngentle swell rises and sinks with unceasing regularity, like the bosom\r\nof a man in deep slumber.\r\n\r\nDense clouds of black smoke and occasional lurid sheets of flame rose\r\nfrom the try-works, which were situated between the foremast and the\r\nmain-hatch.  The tops of the masts were lost in the curling smoke, and\r\nthe black waves of the sea gleamed and flashed in the red light all\r\nround the ship.  One man stood in front of the melting-pot, pitching in\r\npieces of blubber with a two-pronged pitchfork.  Two comrades stood by\r\nthe pots, stirring up their contents, and throwing their figures into\r\nwild uncouth attitudes, while the fire glared in their greasy faces, and\r\nconverted the front of their entire persons into deep vermilion.\r\n\r\nThe oil was hissing in the try-pots; the rough weather-beaten faces of\r\nthe men on the windlass were smeared, and their dirty-white ducks\r\nsaturated, with oil.  The decks were blood-stained; huge masses of flesh\r\nand blubber lay scattered about; sparks flew upwards in splendid showers\r\nas the men raked up the fires; the decks, bulwarks, railings, try-works,\r\nand windlass were covered with oil and slime, and glistening in the red\r\nglare.  It was a terrible, murderous-looking scene, and filled Ailie's\r\nmind with mingled feelings of wonder, disgust, and awe, as she leaned on\r\na comparatively clean spot near the foremast, listening to the men and\r\ngazing at the rolling smoke and flames.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't it beautiful?\" said a short, fat little seaman named Gurney, who\r\nsat swinging his legs on the end of the windlass, and pointed, as he\r\nspoke, with the head of his pipe to a more than usually brilliant burst\r\nof sparks and flame that issued that moment from the works.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful!\" exclaimed a long-limbed, shambling fellow named Jim\r\nScroggles, \"why, that ain't the word at all.  Now, I calls it\r\nsplendiferous.\"\r\n\r\nScroggles looked round at his comrades, as if to appeal to their\r\njudgment as to the fitness of the word, but not receiving any\r\nencouragement, he thrust down the glowing tobacco in his pipe with the\r\nend of his little finger, and reiterated the word \"splendiferous\" with\r\nmarked emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Did ye ever see that word in Johnson?\" inquired Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"Who's Johnson?\" said Scroggles, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Wot, don't ye know who Johnson is?\" cried Gurney, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"In course I don't; how should I?\" retorted Scroggles.  \"There's ever so\r\nmany Johnsons in the world; which on 'em all do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I mean Johnson wot wrote the diksh'nary--the great lexikragofer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's _him_ you mean, is it?  In course I've knowed him ever since I\r\nwos at school.\"\r\n\r\nA general laugh interrupted the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"At school!\" cried Nickel Sling, who approached the group at that moment\r\nwith a carving knife in his hand--he seldom went anywhere without an\r\ninstrument of office in his hand--\"At school!  Wal now, that beats\r\ncreation.  If ye wos, I'm sartin ye only larned to forgit all ye orter\r\nto have remembered.  I'd take a bet now, ye wosn't at school as long as\r\nI've been settin' on this here windlass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer about right, Sling, it 'ud be unpossible for me to be as _long_ as\r\nyou anywhere, 'cause everybody knows I'm only five fut two, whereas\r\nyou're six fut four!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" shouted Dick Barnes--a man with a huge black beard, who\r\nthe reader may perhaps remember was the first to \"raise the oil.\"\r\n\"It'll be long before you make another joke like that, Gurney.  Come,\r\nnow, give us a song, Gurney, do; there's the cap'n's darter standin' by\r\nthe foremast, a-waitin' to hear ye.  Give us `Long, long ago.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's it, give us a song,\" cried the men.  \"Come, there's a good\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's so long ago since I sung that song, shipmates,\" replied\r\nGurney, \"that I've bin and forgot it; but Tim Rokens knows it; where's\r\nRokens?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in the watch below.\"\r\n\r\nIn sea parlance, the men whose turn it is to take rest after their long\r\nwatch on deck are somewhat facetiously said to belong to the \"watch\r\nbelow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's a pity; so we can't have that 'ere partickler song.  But\r\nI'll give ye another, if ye don't object.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no.  All right; go ahead, Gurney!  Is there a chorus to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, in course there is.  Wot's a song without a chorus?  Wot's\r\nplum-duff without the plums?  Wot's a ship without a 'elm?  It's my\r\nopinion, shipmates, that a song without a chorus is no better than it\r\nshould be.  It's wus nor nothin'.  It puts them wot listens in the blues\r\nan' the man wot sings into the stews--an' sarve him right.  I wouldn't,\r\nno, I wouldn't give the fag-end o' nothin' mixed in bucket o' salt water\r\nfor a song without a chorus--that's flat; so here goes.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of these opinions in an extremely vigorous\r\nmanner, and announced the fact that he was about to begin, Gurney\r\ncleared his throat and drew a number of violent puffs from his pipe in\r\nquick succession, in order to kindle that instrument into a glow which\r\nwould last through the first verse and the commencement of the chorus.\r\nThis he knew was sufficient, for the men, when once fairly started on\r\nthe chorus, would infallibly go on to the end with or without his\r\nassistance, and would therefore afford him time for a few restorative\r\nwhiffs.\r\n\r\n\"It hain't got no name, lads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Gurney--all right--fire away.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, I once know'd a man as hadn't got a nose,\r\n  An' this is how he come to hadn't--\r\n  One cold winter night he went and got it froze--\r\n  By the pain he was well-nigh madden'd.\r\n  (_Chorus_.)  Well-nigh madden'd,\r\n  By the pain he was well-nigh madden'd.\r\n\r\n  \"Next day it swoll up as big as my head,\r\n  An' it turn'd like a piece of putty;\r\n  It kivered up his mouth, oh, yes, so it did,\r\n  So he could not smoke his cutty.\r\n  (_Chorus_.)  Smoke his cutty,\r\n  So he could not smoke his cutty.\r\n\r\n  \"Next day it grew black, and the next day blue,\r\n  An' tough as a junk of leather;\r\n  (Oh! he yelled, so he did, fit to pierce ye through)--\r\n  An' then it fell off altogether!\r\n  (_Chorus_.)  Fell off altogether,\r\n  An' then it fell off altogether!\r\n\r\n  \"But the morial is wot you've now got to hear,\r\n  An' it's good--as sure as a gun;\r\n  An' you'll never forget it, my messmates dear,\r\n  For this song it hain't got none!\r\n  (_Chorus_.)  Hain't got none,\r\n  For this song it hain't got none!\"\r\n\r\nThe applause that followed this song was most enthusiastic, and\r\nevidently gratifying to Gurney, who assumed a modest deprecatory air as\r\nhe proceeded to light his pipe, which had been allowed to go out at the\r\nthird verse, the performer having become so engrossed in his subject as\r\nto have forgotten the interlude of puffs at that point.\r\n\r\n\"Well sung, Gurney.  Who made it?\" inquired Phil Briant, an Irishman,\r\nwho, besides being a jack-of-all-trades and an able-bodied seaman, was\r\nat that time acting-assistant to the cook and steward, the latter--a\r\nhalf Spaniard and half negro, of Californian extraction--being unwell.\r\n\r\n\"I'm bound not to tell,\" replied Gurney, with a conscious air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then, yer right, my boy, for it's below the average entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Phil, none o' yer chaff,\" cried Dick Barnes, \"that song desarves\r\nsomethin' arter it.  Suppose now, Phil, that you wos to go below and\r\nfetch the bread-kid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it,\" replied Phil, looking solemn, \"on no account wotiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause its unpossible.  Why, if I did, sure that surly compound o' all\r\nsorts o' human blood would pitch into me with the carvin'-knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?  Tarquin?\" cried Dick Barnes, naming the steward.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure enough that same--Tarquin's his name, an it's kuriously\r\nbefittin' the haythen, for of all the cross-grained mixtures o' buffalo,\r\nbear, bandicoot, and crackadile I iver seed, he's out o' sight--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I hear any one mention my name?\" inquired the steward himself who\r\ncame aft at that moment.  He was a wild Spanish-like fellow, with a\r\nhandsome-enough figure, and a swart countenance that might have been\r\ngood-looking but for the thickish lips and nose and the bad temper that\r\nmarked it.  Since getting into the tropics, the sailors had modified\r\ntheir costumes considerably, and as each man had in some particular\r\nallowed himself a slight play of fancy, their appearance, when grouped\r\ntogether, was varied and picturesque.  Most of them wore no shoes, and\r\nthe caps of some were, to say the least, peculiar.  Tarquin wore a\r\nbroad-brimmed straw hat, with a conical crown, and a red silk sash tied\r\nround his waist.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tarquin,\" replied Barnes, \"we _wos_ engaged in makin'\r\nfree-an'-easy remarks on you; and Phil Briant there gave us to\r\nunderstand that you wouldn't let us have the bread--kid up.  Now, it's\r\nmy opinion you ain't goin' to be so hard on us as that; you will let us\r\nhave it up to comfort our hearts on this fine night, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe steward, whose green visage showed that he was too ill to enter into\r\na dispute at that time, turned on his heel and walked aft, remarking\r\nthat they might eat the bottom out o' the ship, for all he cared.\r\n\r\n\"There now, you misbemannered Patlander, go and get it, or we'll throw\r\nyou overboard,\" cried Scroggles, twisting his long limbs awkwardly as he\r\nshifted his position on the windlass.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, shipmates, don't go for to ax it,\" said Briant, remaining\r\nimmovable.  \"Don't I know wot's best for ye?  Let me spaake to ye now.\r\nDid any of ye iver study midsin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried several with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I thought not,\" continued Phil, with a patronising air, \"or ye'd\r\nniver ask for the bread--kid out o' saisin.  Now I was in the medical\r\nway meself wance--ay, ye may laugh, but it's thrue--I wos 'prentice to a\r\n'pothecary, an' I've mixed up more midsins than would pisen the whole\r\npopilation of owld Ireland--barrin' the praists, av coorse.  And didn't\r\nI hear the convarse o' all the doctors in the place?  And wasn't the\r\nword always--`Be rigglar with yer mails--don't ait, avic, more nor three\r\ntimes a day, and not too much, now.  Be sparin'.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! ye long-winded grampus,\" interrupted Dick Barnes, impatiently.\r\n\"An' warn't the doctors right?  Three times a day for sick folk, and six\r\ntimes--or more--for them wot's well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried the others, while two of them seized Briant by the\r\nneck, and thrust him forcibly towards the after-hatch.  \"Bring up the\r\nkid, now; an' if ye come without it, look out for squalls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! worse luck,\" sighed the misused assistant, as he disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Phil returned with the kid, which was a species of tray\r\nfilled with broken sea-biscuit, which, when afloat, goes by the name of\r\n\"bread.\"\r\n\r\nThis was eagerly seized, for the appetites of sailors are always sharp,\r\nexcept immediately after meals.  A quantity of the broken biscuit was\r\nput into a strainer, and fried in whale-oil, and the men sat round the\r\nkid to enjoy their luxurious feast, and relate their adventures--all of\r\nwhich were more or less marvellous, and many of them undoubtedly true.\r\n\r\nThe more one travels in this world of ours, and the more one reads of\r\nthe adventures of travellers upon whose narratives we can place implicit\r\nconfidence, the more we find that men do not now require, as they did of\r\nold, to draw upon their imaginations for marvellous tales of wild,\r\nromantic adventure, in days gone by, travellers were few; foreign lands\r\nwere almost unknown.  Not many books were written; and of the few that\r\nwere, very few were believed.  In the present day men of undoubted\r\ntruthfulness have roamed far and wide over the whole world, their books\r\nare numbered by hundreds, and much that was related by ancient\r\ntravellers, but not believed, has now been fully corroborated.  More\r\nthan that, it is now known that men have every where received, as true,\r\nstatements which modern discovery has proved to be false, and on the\r\nother hand they have often refused to believe what is now ascertained to\r\nbe literally true.\r\n\r\nWe would suggest, in passing, that a lesson might be learned from this\r\nfact--namely, that we ought to receive a statement in regard to a\r\nforeign land, not according to the probability or the improbability of\r\nthe statement itself, but according to the credibility of him who makes\r\nit.  Ailie Dunning had a trustful disposition; she acted on neither of\r\nthe above principles.  She believed all she heard, poor thing, and\r\ntherefore had a head pretty well stored with mingled fact and nonsense.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were engaged with their meal, Dr Hopley came on deck and\r\nfound her leaning over the stern, looking down at the waves which shone\r\nwith sparkling phosphorescent light.  An almost imperceptible breeze had\r\nsprung up, and the way made by the vessel as she passed through the\r\nwater was indicated by a stream of what appeared lambent blue flame.\r\n\r\n\"Looking at the fish, Ailie, as usual?\" said the doctor as he came up.\r\n\"What are they saying to you to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not looking at the fish,\" answered Ailie; \"I'm looking at the\r\nfire--no, not the fire; papa said it wasn't fire, but it's so like it, I\r\ncan scarcely call it anything else.  What _is_ it, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is called phosphorescence,\" replied the doctor, leaning over the\r\nbulwarks, and looking down at the fiery serpent that seemed as if it\r\nclung to the ship's rudder.  \"But I dare say you don't know what that\r\nmeans.  You know what fire-flies and glow-worms are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes; I've often caught them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are immense numbers of very small and very thin jelly-like\r\ncreatures in the sea, so thin and so transparent that they can scarcely\r\nbe observed in the water.  These Medusae, as they are called, possess\r\nthe power of emitting light similar to that of the fire-fly.  In short,\r\nAilie, they are the fire-flies and glow-worms of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThe child listened with wonder, and for some minutes remained silent.\r\nBefore she could again speak, there occurred one of those incidents\r\nwhich are generally spoken of as \"most unexpected\" and sudden, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, are the result of natural causes, and might have\r\nbeen prevented by means of a little care.\r\n\r\nThe wind, as we have said, was light, so light that it did not distend\r\nthe sails; the boom of the spanker-sail hung over the stern, and the\r\nspanker-braces lay slack along the seat on which Ailie and the doctor\r\nknelt.  A little gust of wind came: it was not strong--a mere puff; but\r\nthe man at the wheel was not attending to his duty: the puff, light as\r\nit was, caused the spanker to jibe--that is to fly over from one side of\r\nthe ship to the other--the heavy boom passed close over the steersman's\r\nhead as he cried, \"Look out!\"  The braces tautened, and in so doing they\r\nhurled Dr Hopley violently to the deck, and tossed Ailie Dunning over\r\nthe bulwarks into the sea.\r\n\r\nIt happened at that moment that Glynn Proctor chanced to step on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what's wrong?\" cried the youth, springing forward, catching the\r\ndoctor by the coat, as he was about to spring overboard, and pulling him\r\nviolently back, under the impression that he was deranged.\r\n\r\nThe doctor pointed to the sea, and, with a look of horror, gasped the\r\nword \"Ailie.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant Glynn released his hold, plunged over the stern of the\r\nship, and disappeared in the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE--PREPARATIONS FOR A STORM.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to convey by means of words an adequate idea of the\r\nterrible excitement and uproar that ensued on board the _Red Eric_ after\r\nthe events narrated in the last chapter.  From those on deck who\r\nwitnessed the accident there arose a cry so sharp, that it brought the\r\nwhole crew from below in an instant.  But there was no confusion.  The\r\nmen were well trained.  Each individual knew his post, and whale-men are\r\naccustomed to a sudden and hasty summons.  The peculiarity of the\r\npresent one, it is true, told every man in an instant that something was\r\nwrong, but each mechanically sprang to his post, while one or two\r\nshouted to ascertain what had happened, or to explain.\r\n\r\nBut the moment Captain Dunning's voice was heard there was perfect\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Clear away the starboard-quarter-boat,\" he cried, in a deep, firm tone.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand-by the falls--lower away!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion to urge the sailors; they sprang to the work with\r\nthe fervid celerity of men who knew that life or death depended on their\r\nspeed.  In less time than it takes to relate, the boat was leaping over\r\nthe long ocean swell, as it had never yet done in chase of the whale,\r\nand, in a few seconds, passed out of the little circle of light caused\r\nby the fires and into the gloom that surrounded the ship.\r\n\r\nThe wind had been gradually increasing during all these proceedings, and\r\nalthough no time had been lost, and the vessel had been immediately\r\nbrought up into the wind, Ailie and Glynn were left struggling in the\r\ndark sea a long way behind ere the quarter-boat could be lowered; and\r\nnow that it was fairly afloat, there was still the danger of its failing\r\nto hit the right direction of the objects of which it was in search.\r\n\r\nAfter leaping over the stern, Glynn Proctor, the moment he rose to the\r\nsurface, gave a quick glance at the ship, to make sure of her exact\r\nposition, and then struck out in a straight line astern, for he knew\r\nthat wherever Ailie fell, there she would remain struggling until she\r\nsank.  Glynn was a fast and powerful swimmer.  He struck out with\r\ndesperate energy, and in a few minutes the ship was out of sight behind\r\nhim.  Then he paused suddenly, and letting his feet sink until he\r\nattained an upright position, trod the water and raised himself\r\nbreast-high above the surface, at the same time listening intently, for\r\nhe began to fear that he might have overshot his mark.  No sound met his\r\nstraining ear save the sighing of the breeze and the ripple of the water\r\nas it lapped against his chest.  It was too dark to see more than a few\r\nyards in any direction.\r\n\r\nGlynn knew that each moment lost rendered his chance of saving the child\r\nterribly slight.  He shouted \"Ailie!\" in a loud, agonising cry, and swam\r\nforward again with redoubled energy, continuing the cry from time to\r\ntime, and raising himself occasionally to look round him.  The\r\nexcitement of his mind, and the intensity with which it was bent on the\r\none great object, rendered him at first almost unobservant of the flight\r\nof time.  But suddenly the thought burst upon him that fully ten minutes\r\nor a quarter of an hour had elapsed since Ailie fell overboard, and that\r\nno one who could not swim could exist for half that time in deep water.\r\nHe shrieked with agony at the thought, and, fancying that he must have\r\npassed the child, he turned round and swam desperately towards the point\r\nwhere he supposed the ship lay.  Then he thought, \"What if I have turned\r\njust as I was coming up with her?\"  So he turned about again, but as the\r\nhopelessness of his efforts once more occurred to him, he lost all\r\npresence of mind, and began to shout furiously, and to strike out wildly\r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his mad struggles his hand struck an object floating\r\nnear him.  Instantly he felt his arm convulsively grasped, and the next\r\nmoment he was seized round the neck in a gripe so violent that it almost\r\nchoked him.  He sank at once, and the instinct of self-preservation\r\nrestored his presence of mind.  With a powerful effort he tore Ailie\r\nfrom her grasp, and quickly raised himself to the surface, where he swam\r\ngently with his left hand, and held the struggling child at arm's-length\r\nwith his right.\r\n\r\nThe joy caused by the knowledge that she had still life to struggle\r\ninfused new energy into Glynn's well-nigh exhausted frame, and he\r\nassumed as calm and cheerful a tone as was possible under the\r\ncircumstances when he exclaimed--\"Ailie, Ailie, don't struggle, dear,\r\nI'll save you _if you keep quiet_.\"\r\n\r\nAilie was quiet in a moment.  She felt in the terror of her young heart\r\nan almost irresistible desire to clutch at Glynn's neck; but the\r\nwell-known voice reassured her, and her natural tendency to place blind,\r\nimplicit confidence in others, served her in this hour of need, for she\r\nobeyed his injunctions at once.\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear,\" said Glynn, with nervous rapidity, \"don't grasp me, else we\r\nshall sink.  Trust me.  _I'll never let you go_.  Will you trust me?\"\r\n\r\nAilie gazed wildly at her deliverer through her wet and tangled tresses,\r\nand with great difficulty gasped the word \"Yes,\" while she clenched the\r\ngarments on her labouring bosom with her little hands, as if to show her\r\ndetermination to do as she was bid.\r\n\r\nGlynn at once drew her towards him and rested her head on his shoulder.\r\nThe child gave vent to a deep, broken sigh of relief, and threw her\r\nright arm round his neck, but the single word \"Ailie,\" uttered in a\r\nremonstrative tone, caused her to draw it quickly back and again grasp\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\nAll this time Glynn had been supporting himself by that process\r\nwell-known to swimmers as \"treading water,\" and had been so intent upon\r\nhis purpose of securing the child, that he failed to observe the light\r\nof a lantern gleaming in the far distance on the sea, as the boat went\r\nploughing hither and thither, the men almost breaking the oars in their\r\ndesperate haste, and the captain standing in the stern-sheets, pale as\r\ndeath, holding the light high over his head, and gazing with a look of\r\nunutterable agony into the surrounding gloom.\r\n\r\nGlynn now saw the distant light, and exerting his voice to the utmost,\r\ngave vent to a prolonged cry.  Ailie looked up in her companion's face\r\nwhile he listened intently.  The moving light became stationary for a\r\nmoment, and a faint reply floated back to them over the waves.  Again\r\nGlynn raised his voice to the utmost, and the cheer that came back told\r\nhim that he had been heard.\r\n\r\nBut the very feeling of relief at the prospect of immediate deliverance\r\nhad well-nigh proved fatal to them both; for Glynn experienced a sudden\r\nrelaxation of his whole system, and he felt as if he could not support\r\nhimself and his burden a minute longer.\r\n\r\n\"Ailie,\" he said faintly but quickly, \"we shall be saved if you obey at\r\n_once_; if not, we shall be drowned.  Lay your two hands on my breast,\r\nand let yourself sink _down to the very lips_.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn turned on his back as he spoke, spread out his arms and legs to\r\ntheir full extent, let his head fall back, until it sank, leaving only\r\nhis lips, nose, and chin above water, and lay as motionless as if he had\r\nbeen dead.  And now came poor Ailie's severest trial.  When she allowed\r\nherself to sink, and felt the water rising about her ears, and lipping\r\nround her mouth, terror again seized upon her; but she felt Glynn's\r\nbreast heaving under her hands, so she raised her eyes to heaven and\r\nprayed silently to Him who is the only true deliverer from dangers.  Her\r\nself-possession was restored, and soon she observed the boat bearing\r\ndown on the spot, and heard the men as they shouted to attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAilie tried to reply, but her tiny voice was gone, and her soul was\r\nfilled with horror as she saw the boat about to pass on.  In her agony\r\nshe began to struggle.  This roused Glynn, who had rested sufficiently\r\nto have recovered a slight degree of strength.  He immediately raised\r\nhis head, and uttered a wild cry as he grasped Ailie again with his arm.\r\n\r\nThe rowers paused; the light of the lantern gleamed over the sea, and\r\nfell upon the spray tossed up by Glynn.  Next moment the boat swept up\r\nto them--and they were saved.\r\n\r\nThe scene that followed baffles all description.  Captain Dunning fell\r\non his knees beside Ailie, who was too much exhausted to speak, and\r\nthanked God, in the name of Jesus Christ, again and again for her\r\ndeliverance.  A few of the men shouted; others laughed hysterically; and\r\nsome wept freely as they crowded round their shipmate, who, although\r\nable to sit up, could not speak except in disjointed sentences.  Glynn,\r\nhowever, recovered quickly, and even tried to warm himself by pulling an\r\noar before they regained the ship, but Ailie remained in a state of\r\npartial stupor, and was finally carried on board and down into the\r\ncabin, and put between warm blankets by her father and Dr Hopley.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Glynn was hurried forward, and dragged down into the\r\nforecastle by the whole crew, who seemed unable to contain themselves\r\nfor joy, and expressed their feelings in ways that would have been\r\ndeemed rather absurd on ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\n\"Change yer clo's, avic, at wance,\" cried Phil Briant, who was the most\r\nofficious and violent in his offers of assistance to Glynn.  \"Och! but\r\nit's wet ye are, darlin'.  Give me a howld.\"\r\n\r\nThis last request had reference to the right leg of Glynn's trousers,\r\nwhich happened to be blue cloth of a rather thin quality, and which\r\ntherefore clung to his limbs with such tenacity that it was a matter of\r\nthe utmost difficulty to get them off.\r\n\r\n\"That's your sort, Phil--a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull all\r\ntogether,\" cried Dick Barnes, hurrying forward, with a bundle of\r\ngarments in his arms.  \"Here's dry clo's for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, Phil,\" shouted Gurney, who stood behind Glynn and held him\r\nby the shoulders; \"it'll give way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a taste,\" replied the reckless Irishman.  But the result proved\r\nthat Gurney was right, for the words had scarce escaped his lips when\r\nthe garment parted at the knee, and Phil Briant went crashing back among\r\na heap of tin pannikins, pewter plates, blocks, and cordage.  A burst of\r\nlaughter followed, of course, but the men's spirits were too much roused\r\nto be satisfied with this, so they converted the laugh into a howl, and\r\nprolonged it into a cheer; as if their comrade had successfully\r\nperformed a difficult and praiseworthy deed.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, lads,\" cried Glynn.  \"I'm used up, I can't stand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are,\" shouted Nickel Sling, pushing the men violently aside,\r\nand holding a steaming tumbler of hot brandy-and-water under Glynn's\r\nnose.  \"Down with it; that's the stuff to get up the steam fit to bust\r\nyer biler, I calc'late.\"\r\n\r\nThe men looked on for a moment in silence, while Glynn drank, as if they\r\nexpected some remarkable chemical change to take place in his\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\"Och! ain't it swate?\" inquired Phil Briant, who, having gathered\r\nhimself up, now stood rubbing his shoulder with the fragment of the\r\nriven garment.  \"Av I wasn't a taytotaler, it's meself would like some\r\nof that same.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes our hero was divested of his wet garments, rubbed\r\nperfectly dry by his kind messmates, and clad in dry costume, after\r\nwhich he felt almost as well as if nothing unusual had happened to him.\r\nThe men meanwhile cut their jokes at him or at each other as they stood\r\nround and watched, assisted, or retarded the process.  As for Tim\r\nRokens, who had been in the boat and witnessed the rescue, he stood\r\ngazing steadfastly at Glynn without uttering a word, keeping his thumbs\r\nthe while hooked in the arm-holes of his vest, and his legs very much\r\napart.  By degrees--as he thought on what had passed, and the narrow\r\nescape poor little Ailie had had, and the captain's tears, things he had\r\nnever seen the captain shed before and had not believed the captain to\r\nhave possessed--as he pondered these things, we say, his knotty visage\r\nbegan to work, and his cast-iron chin began to quiver, and his shaggy\r\nbrows contracted, and his nose, besides becoming purple, began to twist,\r\nas if it were an independent member of his face, and he came, in short,\r\nto that climax which is familiarly expressed by the words \"bursting into\r\ntears.\"\r\n\r\nBut if anybody thinks the act, on the part of Tim Rokens, bore the\r\nsmallest resemblance to the generally received idea of that sorrowful\r\naffection, \"anybody,\" we take leave to tell him, is very much mistaken.\r\nThe bold harpooner did it thus--he suddenly unhooked his right hand from\r\nthe arm-hole of his vest, and gave his right thigh a slap which produced\r\na crack that would have made a small pistol envious; then he uttered a\r\nsuccession of ferocious roars, that might have quite well indicated\r\npain, or grief, or madness, or a drunken cheer, and, un-hooking the left\r\nhand, he doubled himself up, and thrust both knuckles into his eyes.\r\nThe knuckles were wet when he pulled them out of his eyes, but he dried\r\nthem on his pantaloons, bolted up the hatchway, and rushing up to the\r\nman at the wheel, demanded in a voice of thunder--\"How's 'er head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sou'-sou'-east-and-by-east,\" replied the man, in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Sou'-sou'-east-and-by-east!\" repeated Mr Rokens, in a savage growl of\r\nauthority, as if he were nothing less than the admiral of the Channel\r\nFleet.  \"That's two points and a half off yer course, sir.  Luff, luff,\r\nyou--you--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Tim Rokens turned on his heel, and began to walk up and\r\ndown the deck as calmly as if nothing whatever had occurred to disturb\r\nhis equanimity.\r\n\r\n\"The captain wants Glynn Proctor,\" said the second mate, looking down\r\nthe fore-hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered Glynn, ascending, and going aft.\r\n\r\n\"Ailie wants to see you, Glynn, my boy,\" said Captain Dunning, as the\r\nformer entered the cabin; \"and I want to speak to you myself--to thank\r\nyou Glynn.  Ah, lad! you can't know what a father's heart feels when--Go\r\nto her, boy.\"  He grasped the youth's hand, and gave it a squeeze that\r\nrevealed infinitely more of his feelings than could have been done by\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nGlynn returned the squeeze, and opening the door of Ailie's private\r\ncabin, entered and sat down beside her crib.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Glynn, I want to speak to you; I want to thank you.  I love you so\r\nmuch for jumping into the sea after me,\" began the child, eagerly, and\r\nraising herself on one elbow while she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ailie,\" interrupted Glynn, taking her hand, and holding up his finger\r\nto impose silence, \"you obeyed me _in_ the water, and now I insist on\r\nyour obedience _out_ of the water.  If you don't, I'll leave you.\r\nYou're still too weak to toss about and speak loud in this way.  Lie\r\ndown, my pet.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn kissed her forehead, and forced her gently back on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be good, but don't leave me yet, Glynn.  I'm much better.\r\nIndeed, I feel quite strong.  Oh! it was good of you--\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you,\" said Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"I've no objection to that,\" replied Glynn, \"but don't excite yourself.\r\nBut tell me, Ailie, how was it that you managed to keep afloat so long?\r\nThe more I think of it the more I am filled with amazement, and, in\r\nfact, I'm half inclined to think that God worked a miracle in order to\r\nsave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Ailie, looking very grave and earnest, as she\r\nalways did when our Maker's name happened to be mentioned.  \"Does God\r\nwork miracles still?\"\r\n\r\n\"Men say not,\" replied Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't quite understand what a miracle is,\" continued Ailie,\r\n\"although Aunt Martha and Aunt Jane have often tried to explain it to\r\nme.  Is floating on your back a miracle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Glynn, laughing; \"it isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the way I was saved.  You know, ever since I can remember,\r\nI have bathed with Aunt Martha and Aunt Jane, and they taught me how to\r\nfloat--and it's so nice, you can't think how nice it is--and I can do it\r\nso easily now, that I never get frightened.  But, oh!--when I was tossed\r\nover the side of the ship into the sea I _was_ frightened just.  I don't\r\nthink I _ever_ got such a fright.  And I splashed about for some time,\r\nand swallowed some water, but I got upon my back somehow.  I can't tell\r\nhow it was, for I was too frightened to try to do anything.  But when I\r\nfound myself floating as I used to do long ago, I felt my fear go away a\r\nlittle, and I shut my eyes and prayed, and then it went away altogether;\r\nand I felt quite sure you would come to save me, and you _did_ come,\r\nGlynn, and I know it was God who sent you.  But I became a good deal\r\nfrightened again when I thought of the sharks, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ailie, stop!\" said Glynn.  \"You're forgetting your promise, and\r\nexciting yourself again.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she is, and I must order you out, Master Glynn,\" said the doctor,\r\nopening the door, and entering at that moment.\r\n\r\nGlynn rose, patted the child's head, and nodded cheerfully as he left\r\nthe little cabin.\r\n\r\nThe captain caught him as he passed, and began to reiterate his thanks,\r\nwhen their conversation was interrupted by the voice of Mr Millons, who\r\nput his head in at the skylight and said--\"Squall coming, sir, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, so,\" cried the captain, running upon deck.  \"I've been looking for\r\nit.  Call all hands, Mr Millons, and take in sail--every rag, except\r\nthe storm-trysails.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn hurried forward, and in a few minutes every man was at his post.\r\nThe sails were furled, and every preparation made for a severe squall;\r\nfor Captain Dunning knew that that part of the coast of Africa off which\r\nthe _Red Eric_ was then sailing was subject to sudden squalls, which,\r\nthough usually of short duration, were sometimes terrific in their\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\"Is everything snug, Mr Millons?\"\r\n\r\n\"All snug, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let the men stand-by till it's over.\"\r\n\r\nThe night had grown intensely dark, but away on the starboard-quarter\r\nthe heavens appeared of an ebony blackness that was quite appalling.\r\nThis appearance, that rose on the sky like a shroud of crape, quickly\r\nspread upwards until it reached the zenith.  Then a few gleams of light\r\nseemed to illuminate it very faintly, and a distant hissing noise was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nA dead calm surrounded the ship, which lay like a log on the water, and\r\nthe crew, knowing that nothing more could be done in the way of\r\npreparation, awaited the bursting of the storm with uneasy feelings.  In\r\na few minutes its distant roar was heard,--like muttered thunder.  On it\r\ncame, with a steady continuous roar, as if chaos were about to be\r\nrestored, and the crashing wreck of elements were being hurled in mad\r\nfury against the yet unshattered portions of creation.  Another second,\r\nand the ship was on her beam-ends, and the sea and sky were white as\r\nmilk as the wind tore up the waves and beat them flat, and whirled away\r\nbroad sheets of driving foam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE STORM, AND ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Red Eric_ was thrown on her beam-ends, or nearly so, by\r\nthe excessive violence of the squall, the preparations to meet it had\r\nbeen so well made that she righted again almost immediately, and now\r\nflew before the wind under bare poles with a velocity that was\r\nabsolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nAilie had been nearly thrown out of her berth when the ship lay over,\r\nand now when she listened to the water hissing and gurgling past the\r\nlittle port that lighted her cabin, and felt the staggering of the\r\nvessel, as burst after burst of the hurricane almost tore the masts out\r\nof her, she lay trembling with anxiety and debating with herself whether\r\nor not she ought to rise and go on deck.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning well knew that his child would be naturally filled with\r\nfear, for this was the first severe squall she had ever experienced, so,\r\nas he could not quit the deck himself, he called Glynn Proctor to him\r\nand sent him down with a message.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ailie,\" said Glynn, cheerfully, as he opened the door and peeped\r\nin; \"how d'ye get on, dear?  The captain has sent me to say that the\r\nworst o' this blast is over, and you've nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear that, Glynn,\" replied the child, holding out her\r\nhand, while a smile lighted up her face and smoothed out the lines of\r\nanxiety from her brow.  \"Come and sit by me, Glynn, and tell me what\r\nlike it is.  I wish so much that I had been on deck.  Was it grand,\r\nGlynn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was uncommonly grand; it was even terrible--but I cannot sit with\r\nyou more than a minute, else my shipmates will say that I'm skulking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Skulking, Glynn!  What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's--it's shirking work, you know,\" said Glynn, somewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\nAilie laughed.  \"But you forget that I don't know what `shirking' means.\r\nYou must explain that too.\"\r\n\r\n\"How terribly green you are, Ailie.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! am I?\" exclaimed the child in some surprise.  \"What _can_ have done\r\nit?  I'm not sick.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn laughed outright at this, and then proceeded to explain the\r\nmeaning of the slang phraseology he had used.  \"Green, you must know,\r\nmeans ignorant,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"How funny!  I wonder why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know exactly.  Perhaps it's because when a fellow's asked\r\nto answer questions he don't understand, he's apt to turn either blue\r\nwith rage or yellow with fear--or both; and that, you know, would make\r\nhim green.  I've heard it said that it implies a comparison of men to\r\nplants--very young ones, you know, that are just up, just born, as it\r\nwere, and have not had much experience of life, are green of course--but\r\nI like my own definition best.\"\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be scarcely necessary to remark that our hero was by no\r\nmeans singular in this little preference of his own definition to that\r\nof any one else!\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what does skulking mean, and shirking work?\" persisted Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"It means hiding so as to escape duty, my little catechist; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Glynn, Glynn Proctor,\" roared the first mate from the\r\ndeck--\"where's that fellow?  Skulking, I'll be bound.  Lay aloft there\r\nand shake out the foretopsail.  Look alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" was the ready response as the men sprang to obey.\r\n\r\n\"There, you have it now, Ailie, explained and illustrated,\" cried Glynn,\r\nstarting up.  \"Here I am, at this minute in a snug, dry berth chatting\r\nto you, and in half a minute more I'll be out on the end o' the foreyard\r\nholding on for bare life, with the wind fit to tear off my jacket and\r\nblow my ducks into ribbons, and the rain and spray dashing all over me\r\nfit to blot me out altogether.  There's a pretty little idea to turn\r\nover in your mind, Ailie, while I'm away.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn closed the door at the last word, and, as he had prophesied, was,\r\nwithin half a minute, in the unenviable position above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe force of the squall was already broken, and the men were busy\r\nsetting close-reefed topsails, but the rain that followed the squall bid\r\nfair to \"blot them out,\" as Glynn said, altogether.  It came down, not\r\nin drops, but in masses, which were caught up by the fierce gale and\r\nmingled with the spray, and hurled about and on with such violent\r\nconfusion, that it seemed as though the whole creation were converted\r\ninto wind and water, and had engaged in a war of extermination, the\r\ncentral turmoil of which was the _Red Eric_.\r\n\r\nBut the good ship held on nobly.  Although not a fast sailer she was an\r\nexcellent sea-boat, and danced on the billows like a sea-mew.  The\r\nsquall, however, was not over.  Before the topsails had been set many\r\nminutes it burst on them again with redoubled fury, and the main-topsail\r\nwas instantly blown into ribbons.  Glynn and his comrades were once more\r\nordered aloft to furl the remaining sails, but before this could be done\r\nthe foretopmast was carried away, and in falling it tore away the\r\njib-boom also.  At the same moment a tremendous sea came rolling on\r\nastern; in the uncertain light it looked like a dark moving mountain\r\nthat was about to fall on them.\r\n\r\n\"Luff, luff a little--steady!\" roared the captain, who saw the summit of\r\nthe wave toppling over the stern, and who fully appreciated the danger\r\nof being \"pooped,\" which means having a wave launched upon the\r\nquarterdeck.\r\n\r\n\"Steady it is,\" replied the steersman.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" shouted the captain and several of the men, simultaneously.\r\n\r\nEvery one seized hold of whatever firm object chanced to be within\r\nreach; next moment the black billow fell like an avalanche on the poop,\r\nand rushing along the decks, swept the waist-boat and all the loose\r\nspars into the sea.  The ship staggered under the shock, and it seemed\r\nto every one on deck that she must inevitably founder; but in a few\r\nseconds she recovered, the water gushed from the scuppers and sides in\r\ncataracts, and once more they drove swiftly before the gale.\r\n\r\nIn about twenty minutes the wind moderated, and while some of the men\r\nwent aloft to clear away the wreck of the topsails and make all snug,\r\nothers went below to put on dry garments.\r\n\r\n\"That was a narrow escape, Mr Millons,\" remarked the captain, as he\r\nstood by the starboard-rails.\r\n\r\n\"It was, sir,\" replied the mate.  \"It's a good job too, sir, that none\r\no' the 'ands were washed overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed, Mr Millons; we've reason to be thankful for that; but\r\nI'm sorry to see that we've lost our waist-boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've lost our spare sticks, sir,\" said the mate, with a lugubrious\r\nface, while he wrung the brine out of his hair; \"and I fear we've\r\nnothink left fit to make a noo foretopmast or a jib-boom.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Mr Millons; we shall have to run to the nearest port on the\r\nAfrican coast to refit; luckily we are not very far from it.  Meanwhile,\r\ntell Mr Markham to try the well; it is possible that we may have sprung\r\na leak in all this straining, and see that the wreck of the foretopmast\r\nis cleared away.  I shall go below and consult the chart; if any change\r\nin the weather takes place, call me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the mate, as he placed his hand to windward of his\r\nmouth, in order to give full force to the terrific tones in which he\r\nproceeded to issue his captain's commands.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning went below, and looking into Ailie's berth, nodded his\r\nwet head several times, and smiled with his damp visage benignly--which\r\nacts, however well meant and kindly they might be, were, under the\r\ncircumstances, quite unnecessary, seeing that the child was sound\r\nasleep.  The captain then dried his head and face with a towel about as\r\nrough as the mainsail of a seventy-four, and with a violence that would\r\nhave rubbed the paint off the figurehead of the _Red Eric_.  Then he sat\r\ndown to his chart, and having pondered over it for some minutes, he went\r\nto the foot of the companion-ladder and roared up--\"Lay the course\r\nnor'-nor'-east-and-by-nor'-half-nor', Mr Millons.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Mr Millons replied in an ordinary tone, \"Ay, ay, sir,\" and\r\nthen roared--\"Lay her head nor'-nor'-east-and-by-nor'-half-nor',\" in an\r\nunnecessarily loud and terribly fierce tone of voice to the steersman,\r\nas if that individual were in the habit of neglecting to obey orders,\r\nand required to be perpetually threatened in what may be called a tone\r\nof implication.\r\n\r\nThe steersman answered in what, to a landsman, would have\r\nsounded as a rather amiable and forgiving tone of\r\nvoice--\"Nor'-nor'-east-and-by-nor'-half-nor' it is, sir;\" and thereupon\r\nthe direction of the ship's head was changed, and the _Red Eric_,\r\naccording to Tim Rokens, \"bowled along\" with a stiff breeze on the\r\nquarter, at the rate of ten knots, for the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nRAMBLES ON SHORE, AND STRANGE THINGS AND CEREMONIES WITNESSED THERE.\r\n\r\nVariety is charming.  No one laying claim to the smallest amount of that\r\nvery uncommon attribute, common-sense, will venture to question the\r\ntruth of that statement.  Variety is so charming that men and women,\r\nboys and girls, are always, all of them, hunting after it.  To speak\r\nstill more emphatically on this subject, we venture to affirm that it is\r\nan absolute necessity of animal nature.  Were any positive and\r\nshort-sighted individual to deny this position, and sit down during the\r\nremainder of his life in a chair and look straight before him, in order\r\nto prove that he could live without variety, he would seek it in change\r\nof position.  If he did not do that, he would seek it in change of\r\nthought.  If he did not do _that_, he would die!\r\n\r\nFully appreciating this great principle of our nature, and desiring to\r\nbe charmed with a little variety, Tim Rokens and Phil Briant presented\r\nthemselves before Captain Dunning one morning about a week after the\r\nstorm, and asked leave to go ashore.  The reader may at first think the\r\nmen were mad, but he will change his opinion when we tell him that four\r\ndays after the storm in question the _Red Eric_ had anchored in the\r\nharbour formed by the mouth of one of the rivers on the African coast,\r\nwhere white men trade with the natives for bar-wood and ivory, and where\r\nthey also carry on that horrible traffic in negroes, the existence of\r\nwhich is a foul disgrace to humanity.\r\n\r\n\"Go ashore!\" echoed Captain Dunning.  \"Why, if you all go on at this\r\nrate, we'll never get ready for sea.  However, you may go, but don't\r\nwander too far into the interior, and look out for elephants and wild\r\nmen o' the woods, boys--keep about the settlements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir, and thank'ee,\" replied the two men, touching their caps as\r\nthey retired.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, I want to go too,\" said Glynn Proctor, approaching the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"What! more wanting to go ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and so do I,\" cried Ailie, running forward and clasping her\r\nfather's rough hand; \"I did enjoy myself _so_ much yesterday, that I\r\nmust go on shore again to-day, and I must go with Glynn.  He'll take\r\nsuch famous care of me; now _won't_ you let me go, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, this looks like preconcerted mutiny.  However, I don't\r\nmind if I do let you go, but have a care, Glynn, that you don't lose\r\nsight of her for a moment, and keep to the shore and the settlements.\r\nI've no notion of allowing her to be swallowed by an alligator, or\r\ntrampled on by an elephant, or run away with by a gorilla.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, sir.  You may trust me; I'll take good care of her.\"\r\n\r\nWith a shout of delight the child ran down to the cabin to put on her\r\nbonnet, and quickly reappeared, carrying in her hand a basket which she\r\npurposed to fill with a valuable collection of plants, minerals and\r\ninsects.  These she meant to preserve and carry home as a surprise to\r\naunts Martha and Jane, both of whom were passionately fond of\r\nmineralogy, delighted in botany, luxuriated in entomology, doted on\r\nconchology, and raved about geology--all of which sciences they studied\r\nsuperficially, and specimens of which they collected and labelled\r\nbeautifully, and stowed away carefully in a little cabinet, which they\r\ntermed (not jocularly, but seriously) their \"Bureau of Omnology.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent tropical morning when the boat left the side of the\r\n_Red Eric_ and landed Glynn and Ailie, Tim Rokens and Phil Briant on the\r\nwharf that ran out from the yellow beach of the harbour in which their\r\nvessel lay.  The sun had just risen.  The air was cool (comparatively)\r\nand motionless, so that the ocean lay spread out like a pure mirror, and\r\nrevealed its treasures and mysteries to a depth of many fathoms.  The\r\nsky was intensely blue and the sun intensely bright, while the\r\natmosphere was laden with the delightful perfume of the woods--a perfume\r\nthat is sweet and pleasant to those long used to it, how much more\r\nenchanting to nostrils rendered delicately sensitive by long exposure to\r\nthe scentless gales of ocean?\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors who had shown symptoms of weakness in the chest\r\nduring the voyage, had begged to be discharged and left ashore at this\r\nplace.  He could ill be spared, but as he was fit for nothing, the\r\ncaptain agreed to his request, and resolved to procure a negro to act as\r\ncook's assistant in the place of Phil Briant, who was too useful a man\r\nto remain in so subordinate a capacity.  The sick man was therefore sent\r\non shore in charge of Tim Rokens.\r\n\r\nOn landing they were met by a Portuguese slave-dealer, an American\r\ntrader, a dozen or two partially-clothed negroes, and a large concourse\r\nof utterly naked little negro children, who proved to demonstration that\r\nthey were of the same nature and spirit with white children, despite the\r\ncolour of their skins, by taking intense delight in all the amusements\r\npractised by the fair-skinned juveniles of more northern lands--namely\r\nscampering after each other, running and yelling, indulging in mischief,\r\nspluttering in the waters, rolling on the sand, staring at the\r\nstrangers, making impudent remarks, and punching each other's heads.\r\n\r\nIf the youth of America ever wish to prove that they are of a distinct\r\nrace from the sable sons of Africa, their only chance is to become\r\nparagons of perfection, and give up _all_ their wicked ways.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Ailie, half amused, half frightened, as Glynn lifted her\r\nout of the boat; \"oh! how funny!  Don't they look so _very_ like as if\r\nthey were all painted black?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day to you, gentlemen,\" cried the trader, as he approached the\r\nlanding.  \"Got your foretop damaged, I see.  Plenty of sticks here to\r\nmend it.  Be glad to assist you in any way I can.  Was away in the woods\r\nwhen you arrived, else I'd have come to offer sooner.\"\r\n\r\nThe trader, who was a tall, sallow man in a blue cotton shirt, sailor's\r\ntrousers, and a broad-brimmed straw hat, addressed himself to Glynn,\r\nwhose gentlemanly manner led him to believe he was in command of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Glynn, \"we've got a little damage--lost a good\r\nboat, too; but we'll soon repair the mast.  We have come ashore just\r\nnow, however, mainly for a stroll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" put in Phil Briant, who was amusing the black children--and\r\ngreatly delighting himself by nodding and smiling ferociously at them,\r\nwith a view to making a favourable impression on the natives of this new\r\ncountry.  \"Ay, sir, an' sure we've comed to land a sick shipmate who\r\nwants to see the doctor uncommon.  Have ye sich an article in these\r\nparts?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly,\" replied the trader, \"but I do a little in that way\r\nmyself; perhaps I may manage to cure him if he comes up to my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"We wants a nigger too,\" said Rokens, who, while the others were\r\ntalking, was extremely busy filling his pipe.\r\n\r\nAt this remark the trader looked knowing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said, \"that's your game, is it?  There's your man there; I've\r\nnothing to do with such wares.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the Portuguese slave-dealer as he spoke.\r\n\r\nSeeing himself thus referred to, the slave-dealer came forward, hat in\r\nhand, and made a polite bow.  He was a man of extremely forbidding\r\naspect.  A long dark visage, which terminated in a black peaked beard,\r\nand was surmounted by a tall-crowned broad-brimmed straw hat, stood on\r\nthe top of a long, raw-boned, thin, sinewy, shrivelled, but powerful\r\nframe, that had battled with and defeated all the fevers and other\r\ndiseases peculiar to the equatorial regions of Africa.  He wore a short\r\nlight-coloured cotton jacket and pantaloons--the latter much too short\r\nfor his limbs, but the deficiency was more than made up by a pair of\r\nWellington boots.  His natural look was a scowl.  His assumed smile of\r\npoliteness was so unnatural, that Tim Rokens thought, as he gazed at\r\nhim, he would have preferred greatly to have been frowned at by him.\r\nEven Ailie, who did not naturally think ill of any one, shrank back as\r\nhe approached and grasped Glynn's hand more firmly than usual.\r\n\r\n\"Goot morning, gentl'm'n.  You was vish for git nigger, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we wos,\" replied Tim, with a faint touch of sarcasm in his tone.\r\n\"Can _you_ get un for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yees, sare, as many you please,\" replied the slave-dealer, with a wink\r\nthat an ogre might have envied.  \"Have great many ob 'em stay vid me\r\nalways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then, they must be fond o' bad company,\" remarked Briant, in an\r\nundertone, \"to live along wid such a alligator.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Tim Rokens, who had completed the filling of his\r\npipe, and was now in the full enjoyment of it; \"let's see the feller,\r\nan' I'll strike a bargain with him, if he seems a likely chap.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have strike de bargin vid _me_,\" said the dealer.  \"I vill\r\ncharge you ver' leetle, suppose you take full cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole party, who were ignorant of the man's profession, started at\r\nthis remark, and looked at the dealer in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Wot!\" exclaimed Tim Rokens, withdrawing his pipe from his lips; \"do you\r\n_sell_ niggers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yees, to be surely,\" replied the man, with a peculiarly saturnine\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"A slave-dealer?\" exclaimed Briant, clenching his fists.\r\n\r\n\"Even so, sare.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Briant uttered a shout, and throwing forward his clenched fists\r\nin a defiant attitude, exclaimed between his set teeth--\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! come on!\"\r\n\r\nMost men have peculiarities.  Phil Briant had many; but his most\r\nstriking peculiarity, and that which led him frequently into extremely\r\nawkward positions, was a firm belief that his special calling--in an\r\namateur point of view--was the redressing of wrongs--not wrongs of a\r\nparticular class, or wrongs of an excessively glaring and offensive\r\nnature, but _all_ wrongs whatsoever.  It mattered not to Phil whether\r\nthe wrong had to be righted by force of argument or force of arms.  He\r\nconsidered himself an accomplished practitioner in both lines of\r\nbusiness--and in regard to the latter his estimate of his powers was not\r\nvery much too high, for he was a broad-shouldered, deep-chested,\r\nlong-armed fellow, and had acquired a scientific knowledge of boxing\r\nunder a celebrated bruiser at the expense of a few hard-earned\r\nshillings, an occasional bottle of poteen, and many a severe thrashing.\r\n\r\nJustice to Phil's amiability of character requires, however, that we\r\nshould state that he never sought to terminate an argument with his\r\nfists unless he was invited to do so, and even then he invariably gave\r\nhis rash challenger fair warning, and offered to let him retreat if so\r\ndisposed.  But when injustice met his eye, or when he happened to see\r\ncruelty practised by the strong against the weak, his blood fired at\r\nonce, and he only deigned the short emphatic remark--\"Come on,\"\r\nsometimes preceded by \"Arrah!\" sometimes not.  Generally speaking, he\r\naccepted his own challenge, and _went_ on forthwith.\r\n\r\nOf all the iniquities that draw forth the groans of humanity on this sad\r\nearth, slavery, in the opinion of Phil Briant, was the worst.  He had\r\nnever come in contact with it, not having been in the Southern States of\r\nAmerica.  He knew from hearsay that the coast of Africa was its\r\nfountain, but he had forgotten the fact, and in the novelty of the scene\r\nbefore him, it did not at first occur to him that he was actually face\r\nto face with a \"live slave-dealer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" roared the Irishman, as he struggled in the iron grip of\r\nTim Rokens; and the not less powerful grasp of Glynn Proctor.  \"Och! let\r\nme go!  _Doo_, darlints.  I'll only give him wan--jist _wan_!  Let me\r\ngo, will ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Glynn, tightening his grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Wot a cross helephant it is,\" muttered Rokens, as he thrust his hand\r\ninto his comrade's neckcloth and quietly began to choke him as he\r\ndragged him away towards the residence of the trader, who was an amused\r\nas well as surprised spectator of this unexpected ebullition of passion.\r\n\r\nAt length Phil Briant allowed himself to be forced away from the beach\r\nwhere the slave-dealer stood with his arms crossed on his breast, and a\r\nsarcastic smile playing on his thin lips.  Had that Portuguese\r\ntrafficker in human flesh known how quickly Briant could have doubled\r\nthe size of his long nose and shut up both his eyes, he would probably\r\nhave modified the expression of his countenance; but he didn't know it,\r\nso he looked after the party until they had entered the dwelling of the\r\ntrader, and then sauntered up towards the woods, which in this place\r\ncame down to within a few yards of the beach.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was a mere collection of rudely-constructed native huts,\r\nbuilt of bamboos and roofed with a thatch of palm-leaves.  In the midst\r\nof it stood a pretty white-painted cottage with green-edged windows and\r\ndoors, and a verandah in front.  This was the dwelling of the trader;\r\nand alongside of it, under the same roof, was the store, in which were\r\nkept the guns, beads, powder and shot, etcetera, etcetera, which he\r\nexchanged with the natives of the interior for elephants' tusks and\r\nbar-wood, from which latter a beautiful dye is obtained; also ebony,\r\nindiarubber, and other products of the country.\r\n\r\nHere the trader entertained Tim Rokens and Phil Briant with stories of\r\nthe slave-trade; and here we shall leave them while we follow Glynn and\r\nAilie, who went off together to ramble along the shore of the calm sea.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far when specimens of the strange creatures that dwell\r\nin these lands presented themselves to their astonished gaze.  There\r\nwere birds innumerable on the shore, on the surface of the ocean, and in\r\nthe woods.  The air was alive with them; many being similar to the birds\r\nthey had been familiar with from infancy, while others were new and\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nTo her immense delight Ailie saw many living specimens of the\r\nbird-of-paradise, the graceful plumes of which she had frequently beheld\r\non very high and important festal occasions, nodding on the heads of\r\nAunt Martha and Aunt Jane.  But the prettiest of all the birds she saw\r\nthere was a small creature with a breast so red and bright, that it\r\nseemed, as it flew about, like a little ball of fire.  There were many\r\nof them flying about near a steep bank, in holes of which they built\r\ntheir nests.  She observed that they fed upon flies which they caught\r\nwhile skimming through the air, and afterwards learned that they were\r\ncalled bee-eaters.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! look!\" exclaimed Ailie in that tone of voice which indicated that a\r\nsurprising discovery had been made.  Ailie was impulsive, and the\r\n_tones_ in which she exclaimed \"Oh!\" were so varied, emphatic, and\r\ndistinct, that those who knew her well could tell exactly the state of\r\nher mind on hearing the exclamation.  At present, her \"Oh!\" indicated\r\nsurprise mingled with alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! what, where?\" cried Glynn, throwing forward his musket--for he had\r\ntaken the precaution to carry one with him, not knowing what he might\r\nmeet with on such a coast.\r\n\r\n\"The snake! look--oh!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a huge black snake, about ten feet long, showed itself in\r\nthe grass.  Glynn took aim at once, but the piece, being an old\r\nflint-lock, missed fire.  Before he could again take aim the\r\nloathsome-looking reptile had glided into the underwood, which in most\r\nplaces was so overgrown with the rank and gigantic vegetation of the\r\ntropics as to be quite impenetrable.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! he's gone, Ailie!\" cried Glynn, in a tone of disappointment, as he\r\nput fresh priming into the pan of his piece.  \"We must be careful in\r\nwalking here, it seems.  This wretched old musket!  Lucky for us that\r\nour lives did not depend on it.  I wonder if it was a poisonous\r\nserpent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it was,\" said Ailie, with a look of deep solemnity, as she took\r\nher companion's left hand, and trotted along by his side.  \"Are not all\r\nserpents poisonous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, no.  Why, there are some kinds that are quite harmless.  But\r\nas I don't know which are and which are not, we must look upon all as\r\nenemies until we become more knowing.\"\r\n\r\nPresently they came to the mouth of a river--one of those sluggish\r\nstreams on the African coast, which suggest the idea of malaria and the\r\nwhole family of low fevers.  It glided through a mangrove swamp, where\r\nthe tree seemed to be standing on their roots, which served the purpose\r\nof stilts to keep them out of the mud.  The river was oily, and\r\nsluggish, and hot-looking, and its mud-banks were slimy and liquid, so\r\nthat it was not easy to say whether the water of the river was mud, or\r\nthe mud on the bank was water.  It was a place that made one\r\ninvoluntarily think of creeping monsters, and crawling objects, and\r\nslimy things!\r\n\r\n\"Look! oh! oh! such a darling pet!\" exclaimed Ailie, as they stood near\r\nthe banks of this river wondering what monster would first cleave the\r\nmuddy waters, and raise its hideous head.  She pointed to the bough of a\r\ndead tree near which they stood, and on which sat the \"darling pet\"\r\nreferred to.  It was a very small monkey with white whiskers; a dumpy\r\nlittle thing, that looked at them with an expression of surprise quite\r\nequal in intensity to their own.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it was discovered, the \"darling pet\" opened its little\r\nmouth, and uttered a succession of \"Ohs!\" that rendered Ailie's\r\nexclamations quite insignificant by comparison.  They were sharp and\r\nshort, and rapidly uttered, while, at the same time, two rows of most\r\nformidable teeth were bared, along with the gums that held them.\r\n\r\nAt this Ailie and her companion burst into a fit of irrepressible\r\nlaughter, whereupon the \"darling pet\" put itself into such a passion--\r\ngrinned, and coughed, and gasped, and shook the tree, and writhed, and\r\nglared, to such an extent that Glynn said he thought it would burst, and\r\nAilie agreed that it was very likely.  Finding that this terrible\r\ndisplay of fury had no effect on the strangers, the \"darling pet\" gave\r\nutterance to a farewell shriek of passion, and, bounding nimbly into the\r\nwoods, disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _what_ a funny beast,\" said Ailie, sitting down on a stone, and\r\ndrying her eyes, which had filled with tears from excessive laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it was,\" said Glynn.  \"It's my opinion that a monkey is the\r\nfunniest beast in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Glynn; a kitten's funnier,\" said Ailie, with a degree of emphasis\r\nthat showed she had considered the subject well, and had fully made up\r\nher mind in regard to it long ago.  \"I think a kitten's the _very_\r\nfunniest beast in all the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it is,\" said Glynn thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see _three_ kittens together?\" asked Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't think I ever did.  I doubt if I have seen even two\r\ntogether.  Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! because they are so very, very funny.  Sit down beside me, and I'll\r\ntell you about three kittens I once had.  They were very little--at\r\nleast they were little before they got big.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know what I mean.  They were able to play when they were very\r\nlittle, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I understand.  Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, two were grey, and one was white and grey, but most of it was\r\nwhite; and when they went to play, one always hid itself to watch, and\r\nthen the other two began, and came up to each other with little jumps,\r\nand their backs up and tails curved, and hair all on end, glaring at\r\neach other, and pretending that they were so angry.  Do you know, Glynn,\r\nI really believe they sometimes forgot it was pretence, and actually\r\nbecame angry.  But the fun was, that, when the two were just going to\r\nfly at each other, the third one, who had been watching, used to dart\r\nout and give them _such_ a fright--a _real_ fright, you know--which made\r\nthem jump, oh! three times their own height up into the air, and they\r\ncame down again with a _fuff_ that put the third one in a fright too; so\r\nthat they all scattered away from each other as if they had gone quite\r\nmad.  What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a fish, I think,\" said Glynn, rising and going towards the river,\r\nto look at the object that had attracted his companion's attention.\r\n\"It's a shark, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the creature came so close that they could see it quite\r\ndistinctly; and on a more careful inspection, they observed that the\r\nmouth of the river was full of these ravenous monsters.  Soon after they\r\nsaw monsters of a still more ferocious aspect; for while they were\r\nwatching the sharks, two crocodiles put up their snouts, and crawled\r\nsluggishly out of the water upon a mud-bank, where they lay down,\r\napparently with the intention of taking a nap in the sunshine.  They\r\nwere too far off, however, to be well seen.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it strange, Glynn, that there are such ugly beasts in the world?\"\r\nsaid Ailie.  \"I wonder why God made them?\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Glynn, looking at the child's thoughtful face in some\r\nsurprise.  \"I suppose they must be of some sort of use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes, _of course_ they are,\" rejoined Ailie quickly.  \"Aunt Martha\r\nand Aunt Jane used to tell me that every creature was made by God for\r\nsome good purpose; and when I came to the crocodile in my book, they\r\nsaid it was certainly of use too, though they did not know what.  I\r\nremember it very well, because I was _so_ surprised to hear that Aunt\r\nMartha and Aunt Jane did not know _everything_.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt Aunt Martha and Aunt Jane were right,\" said Glynn, with a\r\nsmile.  \"I confess, however, that crocodiles seem to me to be of no\r\nother use than to kill and eat up everything that comes within the reach\r\nof their terrible jaws.  But, indeed, now I think of it, the very same\r\nmay be said of man, for _he_ kills and eats up at least everything that\r\nhe _wants_ to put into his jaws.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he does,\" said Ailie; \"isn't it funny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't what funny?\" asked Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"That we should be no better than crocodiles--at least, I mean about\r\neating.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, Ailie, we cook our food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! so we do.  I did not remember to think of that.  That's a great\r\ndifference, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Glynn and his little charge to philosophise on the resemblance\r\nbetween men and crocodiles, we shall now return to Tim Rokens and Phil\r\nBriant, whom we left in the trader's cottage.\r\n\r\nThe irate Irishman had been calmed down by reason and expostulation, and\r\nhad again been roused to great indignation several times since we left\r\nhim, by the account of things connected with the slave-trade, given him\r\nby the trader, who, although he had no interest in it himself, did not\r\nfeel very much aggrieved by the sufferings he witnessed around him.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mane to tell me, now, that _whalers_ comes in here for\r\nslaves, do ye?\" said Briant, placing his two fists on his two knees, and\r\nthrusting his head towards the trader, who admitted that he meant to say\r\nthat; and that he meant, moreover, to add, that the thing was by no\r\nmeans of rare occurrence--that whaling ships occasionally ran into that\r\nvery port on their way south, shipped a cargo of negroes, sold them at\r\nthe nearest slave-buying port they could make on the American coast, and\r\nthen proceeded on their voyage, no one being a whit the wiser.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it?\" remarked Tim Rokens, crossing his legs and devoting\r\nhimself to his pipe, with the air of a man who mourned the depravity of\r\nhis species, but did not feel called upon to disturb his equanimity very\r\nmuch because of it.\r\n\r\nPhil Briant clenched his teeth, and glared.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do mean it,\" reiterated the trader.  \"Would you believe it,\r\nthere was one whaler put in here, and what does he do but go and invite\r\na lot o' free blacks aboard to have a blow-out; and no sooner did he get\r\nthem down into the hold then he shut down the hatches, sailed away, and\r\nsold 'em every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! morther, couldn't I burst?\" groaned Phil; \"an' ov coorse they left\r\na lot o' fatherless children and widders behind 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did; but all the widders are married again, and most of the\r\nchildren are grown up.\"\r\n\r\nBriant looked as if he did not feel quite sure whether he ought to\r\nregard this as a comforting piece of information or the reverse, and\r\nwisely remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"And now you must excuse me if I leave you to ramble about alone for\r\nsome time, as I have business to transact; meanwhile I'll introduce you\r\nto a nigger who will show you about the place, and one who, if I mistake\r\nnot, will gladly accompany you to sea as steward's assistant.\"\r\n\r\nThe trader opened a door which led to the back part of his premises, and\r\nshouted to a stout negro who was sawing wood there, and who came forward\r\nwith alacrity.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Neepeelootambo, go take these gentlemen round about the village,\r\nand let them see all that is to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they've got something to say to you about going to sea--would you\r\nlike to go?\"\r\n\r\nThe negro grinned, and as his mouth was of the largest possible size, it\r\nis not exaggeration to say that the grin extended from ear to ear, but\r\nhe made no other reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, please yourself.  You're a free man--you may do as you choose.\"\r\n\r\nNeepeelootambo, who was almost naked, having only a small piece of cloth\r\nwrapped round his waist and loins, grinned again, displaying a double\r\nrow of teeth worthy of a shark in so doing, and led his new friends from\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tim Rokens, turning to the negro, and pointing along the\r\nshore, \"we'll go along this way and jaw the matter over.  Business\r\nfirst, and pleasure, if ye can get it, arterwards--them's my notions,\r\nNip--Nip--Nippi--what's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Coo Tumble, I think,\" suggested Briant.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Nippiloo Bumble--wot a jaw-breaker! so git along, old boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe negro, who was by no means an \"old boy,\" but a stalwart man in the\r\nprime of life, stepped out, and as they walked along, both Rokens and\r\nBriant did their best to persuade him to ship on board the _Red Eric_,\r\nbut without success.  They were somewhat surprised as well as chagrined,\r\nhaving been led to expect that the man would consent at once.  But no\r\nalluring pictures of the delights of seafaring life, or the pleasures\r\nand excitements of the whale-fishery, had the least effect on their\r\nsable companion.  Even sundry shrewd hints, thrown out by Phil Briant,\r\nthat \"the steward had always command o' the wittles, and that his\r\nassistant would only have to help himself when convanient,\" failed to\r\nmove him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nippi-Boo-Tumble,\" cried Tim Rokens, who in his disappointment\r\nunceremoniously contracted his name, \"it's my opinion--private opinion,\r\nmark'ee--that you're a ass, an' you'll come for to repent of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, Nippi-Bumble, he's about right,\" added Briant coaxingly.  \"Come\r\nnow, avic, wot's the raisin ye won't go?  Sure we ain't blackguards\r\nenough to ax ye to come for to be sold; it's all fair and above board.\r\nWhy won't ye, now?\"\r\n\r\nThe negro stopped, and turning towards them, drew himself proudly up;\r\nthen, as if a sudden thought had occurred to him, he advanced a step and\r\nheld up his forefinger to impose silence.\r\n\r\n\"You no tell what I go to say? at least, not for one, two day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a word, honour bright,\" said Phil, in a confidential tone, while\r\nRokens expressed the same sentiment by means of an emphatic wink and\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n\"You mus' know,\" said the negro, earnestly, \"me expec's to be made a\r\nking!\"\r\n\r\n\"A wot?\" exclaimed both his companions in the same breath, and very much\r\nin the same tone.\r\n\r\n\"A king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot?\" said Rokens; \"d'ye mean, a ruler of this here country?\"\r\n\r\nNeepeelootambo nodded his head so violently that it was a marvel it\r\nremained on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Yis.  Ho! ho! ho! 'xpec's to be a king.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when are ye to be crowned, Bumble?\" inquired Briant, rather\r\nsceptically, as they resumed their walk.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, me no say me _goin'_ to be king; me only _'xpec's_ dat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Werry good,\" returned Rokens; \"but wot makes ye for to expect it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!  Me berry clebber fellow--know most ebbery ting.  Me hab doo'd\r\ngood service to dis here country.  Me can fight like one leopard, and me\r\nhab kill great few elephant and gorilla.  Not much mans here hab shoot\r\nde gorilla, him sich terriferick beast; 'bove five foot six tall, and\r\nbigger round de breast dan you or me--dat is a great true fact.  Also,\r\nme can spok Englis'.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' so you expec's they're goin' to make you a king for all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, dat is fat me 'xpec's, for our old king be just dead; but dey\r\nnebber tell who dey going to make king till dey do it.  I not more sure\r\nob it dan the nigger dat walk dare before you.\"\r\n\r\nNeepeelootambo pointed as he spoke to a negro who certainly had a more\r\nkingly aspect than any native they had yet seen.  He was a perfect\r\ngiant, considerably above six feet high, and broad in proportion.  He\r\nwore no clothing on the upper part of his person, but his legs were\r\nencased in a pair of old canvas trousers, which had been made for a man\r\nof ordinary stature, so that his huge bony ankles were largely exposed\r\nto view.\r\n\r\nJust as Phil and Rokens stopped to take a good look at him before\r\npassing on, a terrific yell issued from the bushes, and instantly after,\r\na negro ran towards the black giant and administered to him a severe\r\nkick on the thigh, following it up with a cuff on the side of the head,\r\nat the same time howling something in the native tongue, which our\r\nfriends of course did not understand.  This man was immediately followed\r\nby three other blacks, one of whom pulled the giant's hair, the other\r\npulled his nose, and the third spat in his face!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to remark that the sailors witnessed this unprovoked\r\nassault with unutterable amazement.  But the most remarkable part of it\r\nwas, that the fellow, instead of knocking all his assailants down, as he\r\nmight have done without much trouble, quietly submitted to the\r\nindignities heaped upon him; nay, he even smiled upon his tormentors,\r\nwho increased in numbers every minute, running out from among the bushes\r\nand surrounding the unoffending man, and uttering wild shouts as they\r\nmaltreated him.\r\n\r\n\"Wot's he bin doin'?\" inquired Rokens, turning to his black companion.\r\nBut Rokens received no answer, for Neepeelootambo was looking on at the\r\nscene with an expression so utterly woe-begone and miserable that one\r\nwould imagine he was himself suffering the rough usage he witnessed.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! ye don't appear to be chairful,\" said Briant, laughing, as he\r\nlooked in the negro's face.  \"This is a quare counthrie, an' no\r\nmistake;--it seems to be always blowin' a gale o' surprises.  Wot's\r\nwrong wid ye, Bumble?\"\r\n\r\nThe negro groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Sure that may be a civil answer, but it's not o' much use.  Hallo! what\r\nair they doin' wid the poor cratur now?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the crowd seized the black giant by the arms and neck and\r\nhair, and dragged him away towards the village, leaving our friends in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\n\"A very purty little scene,\" remarked Phil Briant when they were out of\r\nsight; \"very purty indade, av we only knowed wot it's all about.\"\r\n\r\nIf the surprise of the two sailors was great at what they had just\r\nwitnessed, it was increased tenfold by the subsequent behaviour of their\r\nnegro companion.\r\n\r\nThat eccentric individual suddenly checked his groans, gave vent to a\r\nlong, deep sigh, and assuming a resigned expression of countenance, rose\r\nup and said--\"Ho!  It all ober now, massa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do believe,\" remarked Rokens, looking gravely at his shipmate, \"that\r\nthe feller's had an attack of the mollygrumbles, an's got better all of\r\na suddint.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, massa, dat not it.  But me willin' to go wid you now to de sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? willin' to go?  Why, Nippi-Too-Cumble, wot a rum customer you are,\r\nto be sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, massa,\" rejoined the negro.  \"Me not goin' to be king now, anyhow;\r\nso it ob no use stoppin' here.  Me go to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not goin' to be king?  How d'ye know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause dat oder nigger, him be made king in a berry short time.  You\r\nmus' know, dat w'en dey make wan king in dis here place, de peeple\r\nchoose de man; but dey not let him know.  He may guess if him please--\r\nlike me--but p'raps him guess wrong--like me!  Ho! ho!  Den arter dey\r\nfix on de man, dey run at him and kick him, as you hab seen dem do, and\r\nspit on him, and trow mud ober him, tellin' him all de time, `You no\r\nking yet, you black rascal; you soon be king, and den you may put your\r\nfoots on our necks and do w'at you like, but not yit; take dat, you\r\ntief!'  An' so dey 'buse him for a littel time.  Den dey take him\r\nstraight away to de palace and crown him, an', oh! arter dat dey become\r\nvery purlite to him.  Him know dat well 'nuff, and so him not be angry\r\njust now.  Ah! me did 'xpec, to hab bin kick and spitted on dis berry\r\nday!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Neepeelootambo uttered the last words in such a deeply touching\r\ntone, and seemed to be so much cast down at the thought that his chance\r\nof being \"kicked and spitted upon\" had passed away for ever, that Phil\r\nBriant burst into a hearty fit of laughter, and Tim Rokens exhibited\r\nsymptoms of internal risibility, though his outward physiognomy remained\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\n\"Och!  Bumble, you'll be the death o' me,\" cried Briant.  \"An' are they\r\na-crownin' of him now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, massa.  Dat what dey go for to do jist now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, then, I'll go an' inspict the coronation.  Come along, Bumble,\r\nme darlint, and show us the way.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Neepeelootambo conducted his new friends into a large\r\nrudely-constructed hut, which was open on three sides and thatched with\r\npalm-leaves.  This was the palace before referred to by him.  Here they\r\nfound a large concourse of negroes, whose main object at that time\r\nseemed to be the creation of noise; for besides yelling and hooting,\r\nthey beat a variety of native drums, some of which consisted of bits of\r\nboard, and others of old tin and copper kettles.  Forcing their way\r\nthrough the noisy throng they reached the inside of the hut, into which\r\nthey found that Ailie Dunning and Glynn Proctor had pushed their way\r\nbefore them.  Giving them a nod of recognition, they sat down on a mat\r\nby their side to watch the proceedings, which by this time were nearly\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThe new king--who was about to fill the throne rendered vacant by the\r\nrecent death of the old king of that region--was seated on an elevated\r\nstool looking very dignified, despite the rough ordeal through which he\r\nhad just passed.  When the noise above referred to had calmed down, an\r\nold grey-headed negro rose and made a speech in the language of the\r\ncountry, after which he advanced and crowned the new king, who had\r\nalready been invested in a long scarlet coat covered with tarnished gold\r\nlace, and cut in the form peculiar to the last century.  The crown\r\nconsisted of an ordinary black silk hat, considerably the worse for\r\nwear.  It looked familiar and commonplace enough in the eyes of their\r\nwhite visitors; but, being the only specimen of the article in the\r\ndistrict, it was regarded by the negroes with peculiar admiration, and\r\ndeemed worthy to decorate the brows of royalty.\r\n\r\nHaving had this novel crown placed on the top of his woolly pate, which\r\nwas much too large for it, the new king hit it an emphatic blow on the\r\ntop, partly with a view to force it on, and partly, no doubt, with the\r\ndesign of impressing his new subjects with the fact that he was now\r\ntheir rightful sovereign, and that he meant thenceforth to exercise all\r\nthe authority, and avail himself of all the privileges that his high\r\nposition conferred on him.  He then rose and made a pretty long speech,\r\nwhich was frequently applauded, and which terminated amid a most\r\nuproarious demonstration of loyalty on the part of the people.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to gladden the heart of a black man, reader, get him into\r\nthe midst of an appalling noise.  The negro's delight is to shout, and\r\nlaugh, and yell, and beat tin kettles with iron spoons.  The greater the\r\nnoise, the more he enjoys himself.  Great guns and musketry, gongs and\r\nbrass bands, kettledrums and smashing crockery, crashing\r\nrailway-engines, blending their utmost whistles with the shrieks of a\r\nthousand pigs being killed, all going at once, full blast, and as near\r\nto him as possible, is a species of Elysium to the sable son of Africa.\r\nOn their occasions of rejoicing, negroes procure and produce as much\r\nnoise as is possible, so that the white visitors were soon glad to seek\r\nshelter, and find relief to their ears, on board ship.\r\n\r\nBut even there the sounds of rejoicing reached them, and long after the\r\ncurtain of night had enshrouded land and sea, the hideous din of royal\r\nfestivities came swelling out with the soft warm breeze that fanned\r\nAilie's cheek as she stood on the quarterdeck of the _Red Eric_,\r\nwatching the wild antics of the naked savages as they danced round their\r\nbright fires, and holding her father's hand tightly as she related the\r\nday's adventures, and told of the monkeys, crocodiles, and other strange\r\ncreatures she had seen in the mangrove-swamps and on the mud-banks of\r\nthe slimy river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nAN INLAND JOURNEY--SLEEPING IN THE WOODS--WILD BEASTS EVERYWHERE--SAD\r\nFATE OF A GAZELLE.\r\n\r\nThe damage sustained by the _Red Eric_ during the storm was found to be\r\nmore severe than was at first supposed.  Part of her false keel had been\r\ntorn away by a sunken rock, over which the vessel had passed, and\r\nscraped so lightly that no one on board was aware of the fact, yet with\r\nsufficient force to cause the damage to which we have referred.  A\r\nslight leak was also discovered, and the injury to the top of the\r\nforemast was neither so easily nor so quickly repaired as had been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nIt thus happened that the vessel was detained on this part of the\r\nAfrican coast for nearly a couple of weeks, during which time Ailie had\r\nfrequent opportunities of going on shore, sometimes in charge of Glynn,\r\nsometimes with Tim Rokens, and occasionally with her father.\r\n\r\nDuring these little excursions the child lived in a world of romance.\r\nNot only were the animals, and plants, and objects of every kind with\r\nwhich she came in contact, entirely new to her, except in so far as she\r\nhad made their acquaintance in pictures, but she invested everything in\r\nthe roseate hue peculiar to her own romantic mind.  True, she saw many\r\nthings that caused her a good deal of pain, and she heard a few stories\r\nabout the terrible cruelty of the negroes to each other, which made her\r\nshudder, but unpleasant thoughts did not dwell long on her mind; she\r\nsoon forgot the little annoyances or frights she experienced, and\r\nrevelled in the enjoyment of the beautiful sights and sweet perfumes\r\nwhich more than counterbalanced the bad odours and ugly things that came\r\nacross her path.\r\n\r\nAilie's mind was a very inquiring one, and often and long did she ponder\r\nthe things she saw, and wonder why God made some so very ugly and some\r\nso very pretty, and to what use He intended them to be put.  Of course,\r\nin such speculative inquiries, she was frequently very much puzzled, as\r\nalso were the companions to whom she propounded the questions from time\r\nto time, but she had been trained to _believe_ that everything that was\r\nmade by God was good, whether she understood it or not, and she noticed\r\nparticularly, and made an involuntary memorandum of the fact in her own\r\nmind, that ugly things were very few in number, while beautiful objects\r\nwere absolutely innumerable.\r\n\r\nThe trader, who rendered good assistance to Captain Dunning in the\r\nrepair of his ship, frequently overheard Ailie wishing \"so much\" that\r\nshe might be allowed to go far into the wild woods, and one day\r\nsuggested to the captain that, as the ship would have to remain a week\r\nor more in port, he would be glad to take a party an excursion up the\r\nriver in his canoe, and show them a little of forest life, saying at the\r\nsame time that the little girl might go too, for they were not likely to\r\nencounter any danger which might not be easily guarded against.\r\n\r\nAt first the captain shook his head, remembering the stories that were\r\nafloat regarding the wild beasts of those regions.  But, on second\r\nthoughts, he agreed to allow a well-armed party to accompany the trader;\r\nthe more so that he was urged thereto very strongly by Dr Hopley, who,\r\nbeing a naturalist, was anxious to procure specimens of the creatures\r\nand plants in the interior, and being a phrenologist, was desirous of\r\nexamining what Glynn termed the \"bumpological developments of the negro\r\nskull.\"\r\n\r\nOn still further considering the matter, Captain Dunning determined to\r\nleave the first mate in charge of the ship, head the exploring party\r\nhimself, and take Ailie along with him.\r\n\r\nTo say that Ailie was delighted, would be to understate the fact very\r\nmuch.  She was wild with joy, and went about all the day, after her\r\nfather's decision was announced, making every species of insane\r\npreparation for the canoe voyage, clasping her hands, and exclaiming,\r\n\"Oh! _what_ fun!\" while her bright eyes sparkled to such an extent that\r\nthe sailors fairly laughed in her face when they looked at her.\r\n\r\nPreparations were soon made.  The party consisted of the captain and his\r\nlittle child, Glynn Proctor (of course), Dr Hopley, Tim Rokens, Phil\r\nBriant, Jim Scroggles, the trader, and Neepeelootambo, which last had\r\nbeen by that time regularly domesticated on board, and was now known by\r\nthe name of King Bumble, which name, being as good as his own, and more\r\npronounceable, we shall adopt from this time forward.\r\n\r\nThe very morning after the proposal was made, the above party embarked\r\nin the trader's canoe; and plying their paddles with the energy of men\r\nbent on what is vulgarly termed \"going the whole hog,\" they quickly\r\nfound themselves out of sight of their natural element, the ocean, and\r\nsurrounded by the wild, rich, luxuriant vegetation of equatorial Africa.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" remarked Tim Rokens, as they ceased paddling, and ran the canoe\r\nunder the shade of a broad palm-tree that overhung the river, in order\r\nto take a short rest and a smoke after a steady paddle of some\r\nmiles--\"Now this is wot I calls glorious, so it is!  Ain't it?  Pass the\r\n'baccy this way.\"\r\n\r\nThis double remark was made to King Bumble, who passed the tobacco-pouch\r\nto his friend, after helping himself, and admitted that it was\r\n\"mugnifercent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here have I bin a-sittin' in this here canoe,\" continued Rokens, \"for\r\nmore nor two hours, an' to my sartin knowledge I've seed with my two\r\neyes twelve sharks (for I counted 'em every one) at the mouth of the\r\nriver, and two crocodiles, and the snout of a hopplepittimus; is that\r\nwot ye calls it?\"\r\n\r\nRokens addressed his question to the captain, but Phil Briant, who had\r\njust succeeded in getting his pipe to draw beautifully, answered\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\"Och! no,\" said he; \"that's not the way to pronounce it at all, at all.\r\nIt's a huppi-puppi-puttimus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dun know,\" said Rokens, shaking his head gravely; \"it appears to me\r\nthere's too many huppi puppies in that word.\"\r\n\r\nThis debate caused Ailie infinite amusement, for she experienced\r\nconsiderable difficulty herself in pronouncing that name, and had a very\r\ntruthful picture of the hippopotamus hanging at that moment in her room\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Tim Rokens very funny, papa?\" she remarked in a whisper, looking\r\nup in her father's face.\r\n\r\n\"Hush! my pet, and look yonder.  There is something funnier, if I\r\nmistake not.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed, as he spoke, to a ripple in the water on the opposite side\r\nof the river, close under a bank which was clothed with rank,\r\nbroad-leaved, and sedgy vegetation.  In a few seconds a large crocodile\r\nput up its head, not farther off than twenty yards from the canoe, which\r\napparently it did not see, and opening its tremendous jaws, afforded the\r\ntravellers a splendid view of its teeth and throat.  Briant afterwards\r\nasserted that he could see down its throat, and could _almost_ tell what\r\nit had had for dinner!\r\n\r\n\"Plaze, sir, may I shoot him?\" cried Briant, seizing his loaded musket,\r\nand looking towards the captain for permission.\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use while in that position,\" remarked the trader, who\r\nregarded the hideous-looking monster with the calm unconcern of a man\r\naccustomed to such sights.\r\n\r\n\"You may try;\" said the captain with a grin.  Almost before the words\r\nhad left his lips, Phil took a rapid aim and fired.  At the same\r\nidentical moment the crocodile shut his jaws with a snap, as if he had\r\nan intuitive perception that something uneatable was coming.  The bullet\r\nconsequently hit his forehead, off which it glanced as if it had struck\r\na plate of cast-iron.  The reptile gave a wabble, expressive of lazy\r\nsurprise, and sank slowly back into the slimy water.\r\n\r\nThe shot startled more than one huge creature, for immediately\r\nafterwards they heard several flops in the water near them, but the tall\r\nsedges prevented their seeing what animals they were.  A whole troop of\r\nmonkeys, too, went shrieking away into the woods, showing that those\r\nnimble creatures had been watching all their movements, although, until\r\nthat moment, they had taken good care to keep themselves out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Never fire at a crocodile's head,\" said the trader, as the party\r\nresumed their paddles, and continued their ascent of the stream; \"you\r\nmight as well fire at a stone wall.  It's as hard as iron.  The only\r\nplace that's sure to kill it just behind the foreleg.  The niggers\r\nalways spear them there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they spear them for?\" asked Dr Hopley.\r\n\r\n\"They eat 'em,\" replied the trader; \"and the meat's not so bad after you\r\nget used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Glynn Proctor; \"I should fancy the great difficulty is\r\nto get used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ever chance to go for a week without tasting fresh meat,\"\r\nreplied the trader quietly, \"you'll not find it so difficult as you\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the travellers encamped in the woods, and a wild charmingly\r\nromantic scene their night bivouac was--so thought Ailie, and so, too,\r\nwould you have thought, reader, had you been there.  King Bumble managed\r\nto kindle three enormous fires, for the triple purpose of keeping the\r\nparty warm--for it was cold at night--of scaring away wild beasts, and\r\nof cooking their supper.  These fires he fed at intervals during the\r\nwhole night with huge logs, and the way in which he made the sparks fly\r\nup in among the strange big leaves of the tropical trees and parasitical\r\nplants overhead, was quite equal, if not superior, to a display of\r\nregular fireworks.\r\n\r\nThen Bumble and Glynn built a little platform of logs, on which they\r\nstrewed leaves and grass, and over which they spread a curtain or canopy\r\nof broad leaves and boughs.  This was Ailie's couch.  It stood in the\r\nfull blaze of the centre fire, and commanded a view of all that was\r\ngoing on in every part of the little camp; and when Ailie lay down on it\r\nafter a good supper, and was covered up with a blanket, and further\r\ncovered over with a sort of gauze netting to protect her from the\r\nmosquitoes, which were very numerous--when all this was done, we say,\r\nand when, in addition to this, she lay and witnessed the jovial laughter\r\nand enjoyment of His Majesty King Bumble, as he sat at the big fire\r\nsmoking his pipe, and the supreme happiness of Phil Briant, and the\r\nplacid joy of Tim Rokens, and the exuberant delight of Glynn, and the\r\nsemi-scientific enjoyment of Dr Hopley as he examined a collection of\r\nrare plants; and the quiet comfort of the trader, and the awkward,\r\nshambling, loose-jointed pleasure of long Jim Scroggles; and the beaming\r\nfelicity of her own dear father; who sat not far from her, and turned\r\noccasionally in the midst of the conversation to give her a nod--she\r\nfelt in her heart that then and there she had fairly reached the very\r\nhappiest moment in all her life.\r\n\r\nAilie gazed in dreamy delight until she suddenly and unaccountably saw\r\nat least six fires, and fully half-a-dozen Bumbles, and eight or nine\r\nGlynns, and no end of fathers, and thousands of trees, and millions of\r\nsparks, all jumbled together in one vast complicated and magnificent\r\npyrotechnic display; and then she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, and one for which it is not easy to account, that\r\nhowever happy you may be when you go to sleep out in the wild woods, you\r\ninvariably awake in the morning in possession of a very small amount of\r\nhappiness indeed.  Probably it is because one in such circumstances is\r\nusually called upon to turn out before he has had enough sleep; perhaps\r\nit may be that the fires have burnt low or gone out altogether, and the\r\ngloom of a forest before sunrise is not calculated to elevate the\r\nspirits.  Be this as it may, it is a fact that when Ailie was awakened\r\non the following morning about daybreak, and told to get up, she felt\r\nsulky--positively and unmistakably sulky.\r\n\r\nWe do not say that she looked sulky or acted sulkily--far from it; but\r\nshe felt sulky, and that was a very uncomfortable state of things.  We\r\ndwell a little on this point because we do not wish to mislead our young\r\nreaders into the belief that life in the wild woods is _all_ delightful\r\ntogether.  There are shadows as well as lights there--some of them,\r\nalas! so deep that we would not like even to refer to them while writing\r\nin a sportive vein.\r\n\r\nBut it is also a fact, that when Ailie was fairly up and once more in\r\nthe canoe, and when the sun began to flood the landscape with his golden\r\nlight and turn the water into liquid fire, her temporary feelings of\r\ndiscomfort passed away, and her sensation of intense enjoyment returned.\r\n\r\nThe scenery through which they passed on the second day was somewhat\r\nvaried.  They emerged early in the day upon the bosom of a large lake\r\nwhich looked almost like the ocean.  Here there were immense flocks of\r\nwater-fowl, and among them that strange, ungainly bird, the pelican.\r\nHere, too, there were actually hundreds of crocodiles.  The lake was\r\nfull of little mud islands, and on all of them these hideous and\r\ngigantic reptiles were seen basking lazily in the sun.\r\n\r\nSeveral shots were fired at them, but although the balls hit, they did\r\nnot penetrate their thick hides, until at last one took effect in the\r\nsoft part close behind the foreleg.  The shot was fired by the trader,\r\nand it killed the animal instantly.  It could not have been less than\r\ntwenty feet long, but before they could secure it the carcass sank in\r\ndeep water.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity!\" remarked Glynn, as the eddies circled round the spot\r\nwhere it had gone down.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so it is!\" replied the doctor; \"but he would have been rather large\r\nto preserve and carry home as a specimen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ax yer parding, sir,\" said Tim Rokens, addressing Dr Hopley; \"but\r\nI'm curious to know if crocodiles has got phrenoligy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" replied the doctor, laughing.  \"Crocodiles have\r\nbrains, and brains when exercised must be enlarged and developed,\r\nespecially in the organs that are most used, hence corresponding\r\ndevelopment must take place in the skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think, doctor,\" remarked the captain, who was somewhat\r\nsceptical, \"that their bumps of combativeness must be very large.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably they are,\" continued the doctor; \"something like my friend\r\nPhil Briant here.  I would venture to guess, now, that his organ of\r\ncombativeness is well-developed--let me see.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who sat close beside the Irishman, caused him to pull in his\r\npaddle and submit his head for inspection.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then, don't operate on me, doctor dear!  I've a mortial fear o'\r\noperations iver since me owld grandmother's pig got its foreleg took off\r\nat the hip-jint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Paddy.  Now the bump lies here--just under--eh! why,\r\nyou haven't got so much as--what!\"\r\n\r\n\"Plaize, I think it's lost in fat, sur,\" remarked Briant, in a plaintive\r\ntone, as if he expected to be reprimanded for not having brought his\r\nbump of combativeness along with him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" resumed the doctor, passing his fingers through Briant's matted\r\nlocks, \"I suppose you're not so combative as we had fancied--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrue for you,\" interrupted Phil.\r\n\r\n\"But, strange enough, I find your organ of veneration is very large,\r\n_very_ large indeed; singularly so for a man of your character; but I\r\ncannot feel it easily, you have such a quantity of hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is it, doctor dear?\" inquired Phil.\r\n\r\n\"This one I am pressing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! don't press so hard, plaze, it's hurtin' me ye are.  Shure\r\nthat's the place where I run me head slap up agin the spanker-boom four\r\ndays ago.  Av _that's_ me bump o' vineration, it wos three times as big\r\nan' twice as hard yisterday--it wos, indade.\"\r\n\r\nInterruptions in this world of uncertainty are not uncommon, and in the\r\nAfrican wilds they are peculiarly frequent.  The interruption which\r\noccurred on the present occasion to Dr Hopley's reply was, we need\r\nscarcely remark, exceedingly opportune.  It came in the form of a\r\nhippopotamus, which rose so close to the boat that Ailie got a severe\r\nstart, and Tim Rokens made a blow at its head with his paddle.  It did\r\nnot seem to notice the boat, but after blowing a quantity of water from\r\nits nostrils, and opening its horrible mouth as if it were yawning, it\r\nslowly sank again into the flood.\r\n\r\n\"Wot an 'orrible crittur!\" exclaimed Jim Scroggles, in amazement at the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"The howdacious willain!\" remarked Rokens.\r\n\r\n\"Is that another on ahead?\" said Glynn, pointing to an object floating\r\non the water about a hundred yards up the river: for they had passed the\r\nlake, and were now ascending another stream.  \"D'ye see it, Ailie?\r\nLook!\"\r\n\r\nThe object sank as he spoke, and Ailie looked round just in time to see\r\nthe tail of a crocodile flop the water and follow its owner to the\r\ndepths below.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" exclaimed Ailie, with one of those peculiar intonations that\r\ntold Glynn she saw something very beautiful, and that induced the\r\nremainder of the crew to rest on their paddles, and turn their eyes in\r\nthe direction indicated.\r\n\r\nThey did not require to ask what she saw, for the child's finger\r\ndirected their eyes to a spot on the bank of the river, where, under the\r\nshadow of a spreading bush with gigantic leaves, stood a lovely little\r\ngazelle.  The graceful creature had trotted down to the stream to drink,\r\nand did not observe the canoe, which had been on the point of rounding a\r\nbank that jutted out into the river where its progress was checked.  The\r\ngazelle paused a moment, looked round to satisfy itself that no enemy\r\nwas near, and then put its lips to the water.\r\n\r\nAlas! for the timid little thing!  There were enemies near it and round\r\nit in all directions.  There were leopards and serpents of the largest\r\nsize in the woods, and man upon the river--although on this occasion it\r\nchanced that most of the men who gazed in admiration at its pretty form\r\nwere friends.  But its worst enemy, a crocodile, was lurking close under\r\nthe mud-bank at its feet.\r\n\r\nScarcely had its parched lips reached the stream when a black snout\r\ndarted from the water, and the next instant the gazelle was struggling\r\nin the crocodile's jaws.  A cry of horror burst from the men in the\r\nboat, and every man seized a musket; but before an aim could be taken\r\nthe struggle was over; the monster had dived with its prey, and nothing\r\nbut a few streaks of red foam floated on the troubled water.\r\n\r\nAilie did not move.  She stood with her hands tightly clasped and her\r\neyes starting almost out of their sockets.  At last her feelings found\r\nvent.  She threw her arms round her father's neck, and burying her face\r\nin his bosom, burst into a passionate flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nNATIVE DOINGS, AND A CRUEL MURDER--JIM SCROGGLES SEES WONDERS, AND HAS A\r\nTERRIBLE ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\nIt took two whole days and nights to restore Ailie to her wonted\r\ncheerful state of mind, after she had witnessed the death of the\r\ngazelle.  But although she sang and laughed, and enjoyed herself as much\r\nas ever, she experienced the presence of a new and strange feeling, that\r\never after that day, tinged her thoughts and influenced her words and\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThe child had for the first time in her life experienced one of those\r\nrude shocks--one of those rough contacts with the stern realities of\r\nlife which tend to deepen and intensify our feelings.  The mind does not\r\nalways grow by slow, imperceptible degrees, although it usually does so.\r\nThere are periods in the career of every one when the mind takes, as it\r\nwere, a sharp run and makes a sudden and stupendous jump out of one\r\nregion of thought into another in which there are things new as well as\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe present was such an occasion to little Ailie Dunning.  She had\r\nindeed seen bloody work before, in the cutting-up of a whale.  But\r\nalthough she had been told it often enough, she did not _realise_ that\r\nwhales have feelings and affections like other creatures.  Besides, she\r\nhad not witnessed the actual killing of the whale; and if she had, it\r\nwould probably have made little impression on her beyond that of\r\ntemporary excitement--not even that, perhaps, had her father been by her\r\nside.  But she _sympathised_ with the gazelle.  It was small, and\r\nbeautiful, and lovable.  Her heart had swelled the moment she saw it,\r\nand she had felt a longing desire to run up to it and throw her arms\r\nround its soft neck, so that, when she saw it suddenly struggling and\r\ncrushed in the tremendous jaws of the horrible crocodile, every tender\r\nfeeling in her breast was lacerated; every fibre of her heart trembled\r\nwith a conflicting gush of the tenderest pity and the fiercest rage.\r\nFrom that day forward new thoughts began to occupy her mind, and old\r\nideas presented themselves in different aspects.\r\n\r\nWe would not have the reader suppose, for a moment, that Ailie became an\r\nutterly changed creature.  To an unobservant eye--such as that of Jim\r\nScroggles, for instance--she was the same in all respects a few days\r\nafter as she had been a few hours before the event.  But new elements\r\nhad been implanted in her breast, or rather, seeds which had hitherto\r\nlain dormant were now caused to burst forth into plants by the All-wise\r\nAuthor of her being.  She now _felt_ for the first time--she could not\r\ntell why--that enjoyment was _not_ the chief good in life.\r\n\r\nOf course she did not argue or think out all this clearly and\r\nmethodically to herself.  Her mind, on most things, material as well as\r\nimmaterial, was very much what may be termed a jumble; but undoubtedly\r\nthe above processes of reasoning and feeling, or something like them,\r\nwere the result to Ailie of the violent death of that little gazelle.\r\n\r\nThe very next day after this sad event the travellers came to a native\r\nvillage, at which they stayed a night, in order to rest and procure\r\nfresh provisions.  The trader was well-known at this village, but the\r\nnatives, all of whom were black, of course, and nearly naked, had never\r\nseen a little white girl before, so that their interest in and wonder at\r\nAilie were quite amusing to witness.  They crowded round her, laughing\r\nand exclaiming and gesticulating in a most remarkable manner, and taking\r\nspecial notice of her light-brown glossy hair, which seemed to fill them\r\nwith unbounded astonishment and admiration; as well it might, for they\r\nhad never before seen any other hair except the coarse curly wool on\r\ntheir own pates, and the long lank hair of the trader, which happened to\r\nbe coarse and black.\r\n\r\nThe child was at first annoyed by the attentions paid her, but at last\r\nshe became interested in the sooty little naked children that thronged\r\nround her, and allowed them to handle her as much as they pleased, until\r\nher father led her to the residence of the chief or king of the tribe.\r\nHere she was well treated, and she began quite to like the people who\r\nwere so kind to her and her friends.  But she chanced to overhear a\r\nconversation between the doctor and Tim Rokens, which caused her\r\nafterwards to shrink from the negroes with horror.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on a bank picking wild-flowers some hours after the\r\narrival of her party, and teaching several black children how to make\r\nnecklaces of them, when the doctor and Rokens happened to sit down\r\ntogether at the other side of a bush which concealed her from their\r\nview.  Tim was evidently excited, for the tones of his voice were loud\r\nand emphatic.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, in reply to some questions put to him by the doctor;\r\n\"yes, I seed 'em do it, not ten minutes agone, with my own two eyes.\r\nOh! but I would like to have 'em up in a row--every black villain in the\r\nplace--an' a cutlass in my hand, an'--an' wouldn't I whip off their\r\nheads?  No, I wouldn't; oh, no, by no means wotiver.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something unusually fierce in Rokens' voice that alarmed\r\nAilie.\r\n\r\n\"I was jist takin' a turn,\" continued the sailor, \"down by the creek\r\nyonder, when I heerd a great yellin' goin' on, and saw the trader in the\r\nmiddle of a crowd o' black fellows, a-shakin' his fists; so I made sail,\r\nof course, to lend a hand if he'd got into trouble.  He was scoldin'\r\naway in the native lingo, as if he'd bin a born nigger.\r\n\r\n\"`Wot's all to do?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"`They're goin' to kill a little boy,' says he, quite fierce like,\r\n`'cause they took it into their heads he's bewitched.'\r\n\r\n\"An' sayin' that, he sot to agin in the other lingo, but the king came\r\nup an' told him that the boy had to be killed 'cause he had a devil in\r\nhim, and had gone and betwitched a number o' other people; an' before he\r\nhad done speakin', up comes two fellers, draggin' the poor little boy\r\nbetween them.  The king axed him if he wos betwitched, and the little\r\nchap--from sheer fright, I do believe--said he wos.  Of coorse I\r\ncouldn't understand 'em, but the trader explained it all arter.  Well,\r\nno sooner had he said that, than they all gave a yell, and rushed upon\r\nthe poor boy with their knives, and cut him to pieces.  It's as sure as\r\nI'm sittin' here,\" cried Rokens, savagely, as his wrath rose again at\r\nthe bare recital of the terrible deed he had witnessed.  \"I would ha'\r\nknocked out the king's brains there and then, but the trader caught my\r\nhand, and said, in a great fright, that if I did, it would not only cost\r\nme my life, but likely the whole party; so that cooled me, and I come\r\naway; an' I'm goin' to ax the captin wot we shud do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do nothing,\" said the doctor sadly.  \"Even suppose we were\r\nstrong enough to punish them, what good would it do?  We can't change\r\ntheir natures.  They are superstitious, and are firmly persuaded they\r\ndid right in killing that poor boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor pondered for a few seconds, and then added, in a low voice,\r\nas if he were weighing the meaning of what he said: \"Clergymen would\r\ntell us that nothing can deliver them from this bondage save a knowledge\r\nof the true God and of His Son Jesus Christ; that the Bible might be the\r\nmeans of curing them, if Bibles were only sent, and ministers to preach\r\nthe gospel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why ain't Bibles sent to 'em at once?\" asked Rokens, in a tone of\r\ngreat indignation, supposing that the doctor was expressing his own\r\nopinion on the subject.  \"Is there nobody to look arter these matters in\r\nChristian lands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there are many Bible Societies, and both Bibles and\r\nmissionaries have been sent to this country; but it's a large one, and\r\nthe societies tell us their funds are limited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't they git more funds?\" continued Rokens, in the same\r\nindignant tone, as his mind still dwelt upon the miseries and wickedness\r\nthat he had seen, and that _might_ be prevented; \"why don't they git\r\nmore funds, and send out heaps o' Bibles, an' no end o' missionaries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tim Rokens,\" said the doctor, looking earnestly into his companion's\r\nface, \"if I were one of the missionaries, I might ask you how much money\r\n_you_ ever gave to enable societies to send Bibles and missionaries to\r\nforeign lands?\"\r\n\r\nTim Rokens was for once in his life completely taken aback.  He was by\r\nnature a stolid man, and not easily put out.  He was a shrewd man, too,\r\nand did not often commit himself.  When he did, he was wont to laugh at\r\nhimself, and so neutralise the laugh raised against him.  But here was a\r\nquestion that was too serious for laughter, and yet one which he could\r\nnot answer without being self-condemned.  He looked gravely in the\r\ndoctor's face for two minutes without speaking; then he heaved a deep\r\nsigh, and said slowly, and with a pause between each word--\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Hopley--I--never--gave--a--rap--in--all--my--life.\"\r\n\r\n\"So then, my man,\" said the doctor, smiling, \"you're scarcely entitled\r\nto be indignant with others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot you remark, doctor, is true; I--am--not.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus fully and emphatically condemned himself, and along with\r\nhimself all mankind who are in a similar category, Tim Rokens relapsed\r\ninto silence, deliberately drew forth his pipe, filled it, lit it, and\r\nbegan to smoke.\r\n\r\nNone of the party of travellers slept well that night, except perhaps\r\nthe trader, who was accustomed to the ways of the negroes, and King\r\nBumble, who had been born and bred in the midst of cruelties.  Most of\r\nthem dreamed of savage orgies, and massacres of innocent children, so\r\nthat when daybreak summoned them to resume their journey, they arose and\r\nembarked with alacrity, glad to get away from the spot.\r\n\r\nDuring that day and the next they saw a great number of crocodiles and\r\nhippopotami, besides strange birds and plants innumerable.  The doctor\r\nfilled his botanical-box to bursting.  Ailie filled her flower-basket to\r\noverflowing.  Glynn hit a crocodile on the back with a bullet, and\r\nreceived a lazy stare from the ugly creature in return, as it waddled\r\nslowly down the bank on which it had been lying, and plumped into the\r\nriver.  The captain assisted Ailie to pluck flowers when they landed,\r\nwhich they did from time to time, and helped to arrange and pack them\r\nwhen they returned to the canoe.  Tim Rokens did nothing particularly\r\nworthy of record; but he gave utterance to an immense number of\r\nsententious and wise remarks, which were listened to by Bumble with deep\r\nrespect, for that sable gentleman had taken a great fancy for the bold\r\nharpooner, and treasured up all his sayings in his heart.\r\n\r\nPhil Briant distinguished himself by shooting an immense serpent, which\r\nthe doctor, who cut off and retained its head, pronounced to be an\r\nanaconda.  It was full twenty feet long; and part of the body was cut\r\nup, roasted, and eaten by Bumble and the trader, though the others\r\nturned from it with loathing.\r\n\r\n\"It be more cleaner dan one pig, anyhow,\" remarked Bumble, on observing\r\nthe disgust of his white friends; \"an' you no objic' to eat dat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clainer than a pig, ye spalpeen!\" cried Phil Briant; \"that only shows\r\nyer benighted haithen ignerance.  Sure I lived in the same cabin wid a\r\npig for many a year--not not to mintion a large family o' cocks and\r\nhens--an' a clainer baste than that pig didn't stop in that cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't say much for your own cleanliness, or that of your\r\nfamily,\" remarked Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Och! ye've bin to school, no doubt, haven't ye?\" retorted Phil.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" replied Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Shure I thought so.  It's there ye must have larned to be so oncommon\r\ncliver.  Don't you iver be persuaded for to go to school, Bumble, if ye\r\niver git the chance.  It's a mighty lot o' taichin' they'd give ye, but\r\nniver a taste o' edication.  Tin to wan, they'd cram ye till ye turned\r\nwhite i' the face, an' that wouldn't suit yer complexion, ye know, King\r\nBumble, be no manes.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the trader, he acted interpreter when the party fell in with\r\nnegroes, and explained everything that puzzled them, and told them\r\nanecdotes without end about the natives and the wild creatures, and the\r\ntraffic of the regions through which they passed.  In short, he made\r\nhimself generally useful and agreeable.\r\n\r\nBut the man who distinguished himself most on that trip was Jim\r\nScroggles.  That lanky individual one day took it into his wise head to\r\ngo off on a short ramble into the woods alone.  He had been warned by\r\nthe trader, along with the rest of the party, not to venture on such a\r\ndangerous thing; but being an absent man the warning had not reached his\r\nintellect although it had fallen on his ear.  The party were on shore\r\ncooking dinner when he went off, without arms of any kind, and without\r\ntelling whither he was bound.  Indeed, he had no defined intentions in\r\nhis own mind.  He merely felt inclined for a ramble, and so went away,\r\nintending to be back in half-an-hour or less.\r\n\r\nBut Jim Scroggles had long legs and loved locomotion.  Moreover, the\r\nwoods were exceedingly beautiful and fragrant, and comparatively cool:\r\nfor it happened to be the coolest season of the year in that sultry\r\nregion, else the party of Europeans could not have ventured to travel\r\nthere at all.\r\n\r\nWandering along beneath the shade of palm-trees and large-leaved shrubs\r\nand other tropical productions, with his hands in his breeches pockets,\r\nand whistling a variety of popular airs, which must have not a little\r\nastonished the monkeys and birds and other creatures--such of them, at\r\nleast, as had any taste for or knowledge of music--Jim Scroggles\r\npenetrated much farther into the wilds than he had any intention of\r\ndoing.  There is no saying how far, in his absence of mind, he might\r\nhave wandered, had he not been caught and very uncomfortably entangled\r\nin a mesh-work of wild vines and thorny plants that barred his further\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nJim had encountered several such before in his walk, but had forced his\r\nway through without more serious damage than a rent or two in his shirt\r\nand pantaloons, and several severe scratches to his hands and face; but\r\nScroggles had lived a hard life from infancy, and did not mind\r\nscratches.  Now, however, he could not advance a step, and it was only\r\nby much patient labour and by the free use of his clasp-knife, that he\r\nsucceeded at length in releasing himself.  He left a large portion of\r\none of the legs of his trousers and several bits of skin on the bushes,\r\nas a memorial of his visit to that spot.\r\n\r\nJim's mind was awoken to the perception of three facts--namely, that he\r\nhad made himself late for dinner; that he would be the means of\r\ndetaining his party; and that he had lost himself.\r\n\r\nHere was a pretty business!  Being a man of slow thought and much\r\ndeliberation, he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and looking up,\r\nas men usually do when soliloquising, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"My eye, here's a go!  Wot is to be done?\"\r\n\r\nA very small monkey, with an uncommonly wrinkled and melancholy cast of\r\nvisage, which chanced to be seated on a branch hard by, peering down at\r\nthe lost mariner, replied--\r\n\r\n\"O! o-o-o, O! o-o!\" as much as to say, \"Ah, my boy, that's just the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nJim Scroggles shook his head, partly as a rebuke to the impertinent\r\nlittle monkey and partly as an indication of the hopelessness of his\r\nbeing able to return a satisfactory answer to his own question.\r\n\r\nAt last he started up, exclaiming, \"Wotever comes on it, there's no use\r\no' sitting here,\" and walked straight forward at a brisk pace.  Then he\r\nsuddenly stopped, shook his head again, and said, \"If I goes on like\r\nthis, an' it shud turn out to be the wrong course arter all--wot'll come\r\non't?\"\r\n\r\nBeing as unable to answer this question as the former, he thrust both\r\nhands into his pockets, looked at the ground and began to whistle.  When\r\nhe looked up again he ceased whistling very abruptly, and turned deadly\r\npale--perhaps we should say yellow.  And no wonder, for there, straight\r\nbefore him, not more than twenty yards off, stood a creature which, to\r\nhis ignorant eyes, appeared to be a fiend incarnate, but which was in\r\nreality a large-sized and very ancient sheego monkey.\r\n\r\nIt stood in an upright position like a man, and was above four feet\r\nhigh.  It had a bald head, grey whiskers, and an intensely black\r\nwrinkled face, and, at the moment Jim Scroggles' eyes encountered it,\r\nthat face was working itself into such a variety of remarkable and\r\nhideous contortions that no description, however graphic, could convey a\r\ncorrect notion of it to the reader's mind.  Seen behind the bars of an\r\niron cage it might, perhaps, have been laughable; but witnessed as it\r\nwas, in the depths of a lonely forest, it was appalling.\r\n\r\nJim Scroggles' knees began to shake.  He was fascinated with horror.\r\nThe huge ape was equally fascinated with terror.  It worked its wrinkled\r\nvisage more violently than ever.  Jim trembled all over.  In another\r\nsecond the sheego displayed not only all its teeth--and they were\r\ntremendous--but all its gums, and they were fearful to behold, besides\r\nbeing scarlet.  Roused to the utmost pitch of fear, the sheego uttered a\r\nshriek that rang through the forest like a death-yell.  This was the\r\nculminating point.  Jim Scroggles turned and fled as fast as his long\r\nand trembling legs could carry him.\r\n\r\nThe sheego, at the same instant, was smitten with an identically similar\r\nimpulse.  It turned, uttered another yell, and fled in the opposite\r\ndirection; and thus the two ran until they were both out of breath.\r\nWhat became of the monkey we cannot tell; but Jim Scroggles ran at\r\nheadlong speed straight before him, crashing through brake and bush, in\r\nthe full belief that the sheego was in hot pursuit, until he came to a\r\nmangrove swamp; here his speed was checked somewhat, for the trees grew\r\nin a curious fashion that merits special notice.\r\n\r\nInstead of rising out of the ground, the mangroves rose out of a sea of\r\nmud, and the roots stood up in a somewhat arched form, supporting their\r\nstem, as it were, on the top of a bridge.  Thus, had the ground beneath\r\nbeen solid, a man might have walked _under_ the roots.  In order to\r\ncross the swamp, Jim Scroggles had to leap from root to root--a feat\r\nwhich, although difficult, he would have attempted without hesitation.\r\nBut Jim was agitated at that particular moment.  His step was uncertain\r\nat a time when the utmost coolness was necessary.  At one point the leap\r\nfrom one root to the next was too great for him.  He turned his eye\r\nquickly to one side to seek a nearer stem; in doing so he encountered\r\nthe gaze of a serpent.  It was not a large one, probably about ten feet\r\nlong, but he knew it to be one whose bite was deadly.  In the surprise\r\nand fear of the moment he took the long leap, came short of the root by\r\nabout six inches, and alighted up to the waist in the soft mud.\r\n\r\nAlmost involuntarily he cast his eyes behind him, and saw neither sheego\r\nnor serpent.  He breathed more freely, and essayed to extricate himself\r\nfrom his unpleasant position.  Stretching out his hands to the root\r\nabove his head, he found that it was beyond his reach.  The sudden fear\r\nthat this produced caused him to make a violent struggle, and in his\r\nnext effort he succeeded in catching a twig; it supported him, for a\r\nmoment, then broke, and he fell back again into the mud.  Each\r\nsuccessive struggle only sank him deeper.  As the thick adhesive\r\nsemi-liquid clung to his lower limbs and rose slowly on his chest, the\r\nwretched man uttered a loud cry of despair.  He felt that he was brought\r\nsuddenly face to face with death in its most awful form.  The mud was\r\nsoon up to his arm-pits.  As the hopelessness of his condition forced\r\nitself upon him, he began to shout for help until the dark woods\r\nresounded with his cries; but no help came, and the cold drops of sweat\r\nstood upon his brow as he shrieked aloud in agony, and prayed for mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nJIM SCROGGLES RESCUED, AND GLYNN AND AILIE LOST--A CAPTURE, UPSET,\r\nCHASE, ESCAPE, AND HAPPY RETURN.\r\n\r\nThe merciful manner in which God sends deliverance at the eleventh hour\r\nhas been so often experienced and recognised, that it has originated the\r\nwell-known proverb, \"Man's extremity is God's opportunity;\" and this\r\nproverb is true not only in reference to man's soul, but often, also, in\r\nregard to his temporal affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile the wretched sailor was uttering cries for help, which grew\r\nfeebler every moment as he sank deeper and deeper into what now he\r\nbelieved should be his grave, his comrades were hastening forward to his\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at his prolonged absence, they had armed themselves, and set out\r\nin search of him, headed by the trader and led by the negro, who tracked\r\nhis steps with that unerring certainty which seems peculiar to all\r\nsavages.  The shrieks uttered by their poor comrade soon reached their\r\nears, and after some little difficulty, owing to the cries becoming\r\nfaint, and at last inaudible, they discovered the swamp where he lay,\r\nand revived his hope and energy by their shouts.  They found him nearly\r\nup to the neck in mud, and the little of him that still remained above\r\nground was scarcely recognisable.\r\n\r\nIt cost them nearly an hour, with the aid of poles, and ropes\r\nextemporised out of their garments, to drag Jim from his perilous\r\nposition and place him on solid ground; and after they had accomplished\r\nthis, it took more than an hour longer to clean him and get him\r\nrecruited sufficiently to accompany them to the spot where they had left\r\nthe canoe.\r\n\r\nThe poor man was deeply moved; and when he fully realised the fact that\r\nhe was saved, he wept like a child, and then thanked God fervently for\r\nhis deliverance.  As the night was approaching, and the canoe, with\r\nAilie in it, had been left in charge only of Glynn Proctor, Jim's\r\nrecovery was expedited as much as possible, and as soon as he could walk\r\nthey turned to retrace their steps.\r\n\r\nMan knows not what a day or an hour will bring forth.  For many years\r\none may be permitted to move on \"the even tenor of his way,\" without\r\nanything of momentous import occurring to mark the passage of his little\r\nspan of time as it sweeps him onward to eternity.  At another period of\r\nlife, events, it may be of the most startling and abidingly impressive\r\nnature, are crowded into a few months or weeks, or even days.  So it was\r\nnow with our travellers on the African river.  When they reached the\r\nspot where they had dined, no one replied to their shouts.  The canoe,\r\nGlynn, and the child were gone.\r\n\r\nOn making this terrible discovery the whole party were filled with\r\nindescribable consternation, and ran wildly hither and thither, up and\r\ndown the banks of the river, shouting the names of Glynn Proctor and\r\nAilie, until the woods rang again.  Captain Dunning was almost mad with\r\nanxiety and horror.  His imagination pictured his child in every\r\nconceivable danger.  He thought of her as drowned in the river and\r\ndevoured by crocodiles; as carried away by the natives into hopeless\r\ncaptivity; or, perhaps, killed by wild beasts in the forest.  When\r\nseveral hours had elapsed, and still no sign of the missing ones could\r\nbe discovered, he fell down exhausted on the river's bank, and groaned\r\naloud in his despair.\r\n\r\nBut Ailie was not lost.  The Heavenly Father in whom she trusted still\r\nwatched over and cared for her, and Glynn Proctor's stout right arm was\r\nstill by her side to protect her.\r\n\r\nAbout half-an-hour after the party had gone off in search of their lost\r\ncompanion, a large canoe, full of negroes, came sweeping down the river.\r\nGlynn and Ailie hid themselves in the bushes, and lay perfectly still,\r\nhoping they might be passed by.  But they forgot that the blue smoke of\r\ntheir fire curled up through the foliage and revealed their presence at\r\nonce.  On observing the smoke, the savages gave a shout, and, running\r\ntheir canoe close in to the bank, leaped ashore and began to scamper\r\nthrough the wood like baboons.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes passed before they discovered the two hiders, whom\r\nthey surrounded and gazed upon in the utmost possible amazement,\r\nshouting the while with delight, as if they had discovered a couple of\r\nnew species of monkey.  Glynn was by nature a reckless and hasty youth.\r\nHe felt the power of a young giant within him, and his first impulse was\r\nto leap upon the newcomers, and knock them down right and left.\r\nFortunately, for Ailie's sake as well as his own, he had wisdom enough\r\nto know that though he had possessed the power of ten giants, he could\r\nnot hope, singly, to overcome twenty negroes, all of whom were strong,\r\nactive, and lithe as panthers.  He therefore assumed a good-humoured\r\nfree-and-easy air, and allowed himself and Ailie to be looked at and\r\nhandled without ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe savages were evidently not ill-disposed towards the wanderers.  They\r\nlaughed a great deal, and spoke to each other rapidly in what, to Glynn,\r\nwas of course an unknown tongue.  One who appeared to be the chief of\r\nthe party passed his long black fingers through Ailie's glossy curls\r\nwith evident surprise and delight.  He then advanced to Glynn, and said\r\nsomething like--\r\n\r\n\"Holli--boobo--gaddle--bump--um--peepi--daddle--dumps.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Glynn replied very naturally, \"I don't understand you.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he did not.  And he might have known well enough that the\r\nnegro could not understand _him_.  But he deemed it wiser to make a\r\nreply of some kind, however unintelligible, than to stand like a post\r\nand say nothing.\r\n\r\nAgain the negro spoke, and again Glynn made the same reply; whereupon\r\nthe black fellow turned round to his comrades and looked at them, and\r\nthey, in reply to the look, burst again into an immoderate fit of\r\nlaughter, and cut a variety of capers, the very simplest of which would\r\nhave made the fortune of any merry-andrew in the civilised world, had he\r\nbeen able to execute it.  This was all very well, no doubt, and\r\nexceedingly amusing, not to say surprising; but it became quite a\r\ndifferent matter when, after satisfying their curiosity, these dark\r\ngentlemen coolly collected the property of the white men, stowed it away\r\nin the small canoe, and made signs to Glynn and Ailie to enter.\r\n\r\nGlynn showed a decided objection to obey, on which two stout fellows\r\nseized him by the shoulders, and pointed sternly to the canoe, as much\r\nas to say, \"Hobbi-doddle-hoogum-toly-whack,\" which, being interpreted\r\n(no doubt) meant, \"If you don't go quietly, we'll force you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the young sailor's spirit leaped up.  He clenched his fists, his\r\nbrow flushed crimson, and, in another instant, whatever might have been\r\nthe consequence, the two negroes would certainly have lain recumbent on\r\nthe sward, had it not suddenly occurred to Glynn that he might, by\r\nappearing to submit, win the confidence of his captors, and, at the\r\nfirst night-encampment, quietly make his escape with Ailie in his arms!\r\n\r\nGlynn was at that romantic age when young men have a tendency to think\r\nthemselves capable of doing almost anything, with or without ordinary\r\nfacilities, and in the face of any amount of adverse circumstance.  He\r\ntherefore stepped willingly and even cheerfully into the canoe, in which\r\nhis and his comrades' baggage had been already stowed, and, seating\r\nhimself in the stern, took up the steering-paddle.  He was ordered to\r\nquit that post, however, in favour of a powerful negro, and made to sit\r\nin the bow and paddle there.  Ailie was placed with great care in the\r\ncentre of the canoe among a heap of soft leopard-skins; for the savages\r\nevidently regarded her as something worth preserving--a rare and\r\nbeautiful specimen, perhaps, of the white monkey!\r\n\r\nThis done, they leaped into their large canoe, and, attaching the\r\nsmaller one to it by means of a rope, paddled out from the bank, and\r\ndescended the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Glynn,\" exclaimed Ailie, in a whisper--for she felt that things\r\nwere beginning to look serious--\"what _are_ we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my pet, I don't know,\" replied Glynn, looking round and\r\nencountering the gaze of the negro in the stern, at whom he frowned\r\ndarkly, and received a savage grin by way of reply.\r\n\r\n\"I would like _so_ much to say something to you,\" continued Ailie, \"but\r\nI'm afraid _he_ will know what I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, Ailie; he's as deaf as a post to our language.  Out with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not,\" she said, in a half-whisper, \"cut the rope, and then\r\npaddle away back while _they_ are paddling down the river?\"\r\n\r\nGlynn laughed in spite of himself at this proposal.\r\n\r\n\"And what, my pretty one,\" he said, \"what should we do with the fellow\r\nin the stern?  Besides, the rascals in front might take it into their\r\nheads to paddle after us, you know, and what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Ailie, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't cry, my darling,\" said Glynn, looking over his shoulder with\r\nmuch concern.  \"I'll manage to get you out of this scrape somehow--now\r\nsee if I don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth spoke so confidently, that the child felt somehow comforted,\r\nso drying her eyes she lay back among the leopard-skins, where, giving\r\nvent to an occasional sob, she speedily fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThey continued to advance thus in silence for nearly an hour, crossed a\r\nsmall lake, and again entered the river.  After descending this some\r\ntime, the attention of the whole party was attracted to a group of\r\nhippopotami, gambolling in the mud-banks and in the river a short\r\ndistance ahead.  At any other time Glynn would have been interested in\r\nthe sight of these uncouth monsters, but he had seen so many within the\r\nlast few days that he was becoming comparatively indifferent to them,\r\nand at that moment he was too much filled with anxiety to take any\r\nnotice of them.  The creatures themselves, however, did not seem to be\r\nso utterly indifferent to the strangers.  They continued their gambols\r\nuntil the canoes were quite near, and then they dived.  Now,\r\nhippopotami, as we have before hinted, are clumsy and stupid creatures,\r\nso much so that they occasionally run against and upset boats and\r\ncanoes, quite unintentionally.  Knowing this, the natives in the large\r\ncanoe kept a sharp look-out in order to steer clear of them.\r\n\r\nThey had almost succeeded in passing the place, when a huge fellow, like\r\na sugar-punchean, rose close to the small canoe, and grazed it with his\r\ntail.  Apparently he considered this an attack made upon him by the\r\nboat, for he wheeled round in a rage, and swam violently towards it.\r\nThe negro and Glynn sprang to their feet on the instant, and the former\r\nraised his paddle to deal the creature a blow on the head.  Before he\r\ncould do so, Glynn leaped lightly over Ailie, who had just awakened,\r\ncaught the savage by the ankles, and tossed him overboard.  He fell with\r\na heavy splash just in front of the cavernous jaws of the hippopotamus!\r\nIn fact, he had narrowly escaped falling head-first into the creature's\r\nopen throat.\r\n\r\nThe nearness of the animal at the time was probably the means of saving\r\nthe negro's life, for it did not observe where he had vanished to, as he\r\nsank under its chin, and was pushed by its forelegs right under its\r\nbody.  In its effort to lay hold of the negro, the hippopotamus made a\r\npartial dive, and thus passed the small canoe.  When it again rose to\r\nthe surface the large canoe met its eye.  At this it rushed, drove its\r\nhammer-like skull through the light material of which it was made, and\r\nthen seizing the broken ends in its strong jaws upset the canoe, and\r\nbegan to rend it to pieces in its fury.\r\n\r\nBefore this occurred, the crew had leaped into the water, and were now\r\nswimming madly to the shore.  At the same moment Glynn cut the line that\r\nfastened the two canoes together, and seizing his paddle, urged his\r\ncraft up the river as fast as possible.  But his single arm could not\r\ndrive it with much speed against the stream, and before he had advanced\r\na dozen yards, one of the natives overtook him and several more followed\r\nclose behind.  Glynn allowed the first one to come near, and then gave\r\nhim a tremendous blow on the head with the edge of the paddle.\r\n\r\nThe young sailor was not in a gentle frame of mind at that time, by any\r\nmeans.  The blow was given with a will, and would probably have\r\nfractured the skull of a white man; but that of a negro is proverbially\r\nthick.  The fellow was only stunned, and fell back among his comrades,\r\nwho judiciously considering that such treatment was not agreeable and\r\nought not to be courted, put about, and made for the shore.\r\n\r\nGlynn now kept his canoe well over to the left side of the stream while\r\nthe savages ran along the right bank, yelling ferociously and\r\noccasionally attempting to swim towards him, but without success.  He\r\nwas somewhat relieved, and sent them a shout of defiance, which was\r\nreturned, of course with interest.  Still he felt that his chance of\r\nescape was poor.  He was becoming exhausted by the constant and violent\r\nexertion that was necessary in order to make head against the stream.\r\nThe savages knew this, and bided their time.\r\n\r\nAs he continued to labour slowly up, Glynn came to the mouth of a small\r\nstream which joined the river.  He knew not where it might lead to, but\r\nfeeling that he could not hold out much longer, he turned into it,\r\nwithout any very definite idea as to what he would attempt next.  The\r\nstream was sluggish.  He advanced more easily, and after a few strokes\r\nof the paddle doubled round a point and was hid from the eyes of the\r\nnegroes, who immediately set up a yell and plunged into the river,\r\nintending to swim over; but fortunately it was much too rapid in the\r\nmiddle, and they were compelled to return.  We say fortunately, because,\r\nhad they succeeded in crossing, they would have found Glynn in the\r\nbushes of the point behind which he had disappeared, in a very exhausted\r\nstate, though prepared to fight to the last with all the energy of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he had the extreme satisfaction of seeing his enemies, after\r\nregaining the right bank, set off at a quick run down the river.  He now\r\nremembered having seen a place about two miles further down that looked\r\nlike a ford, and he at once concluded his pursuers had set off to that\r\npoint, and would speedily return and easily recapture him in the narrow\r\nlittle stream into which he had pushed.  To cross the large river was\r\nimpossible--the canoe would have been swamped in the rapid.  But what\r\nwas to hinder him from paddling close in along the side, and perhaps\r\nreach the lake while the negroes were looking for him up the small\r\nstream?\r\n\r\nHe put this plan into execution at once; and Ailie took a paddle in her\r\nsmall hands and did her utmost to help him.  It wasn't much, poor thing;\r\nbut to hear the way in which Glynn encouraged her and spoke of her\r\nefforts, one would have supposed she had been as useful as a full-grown\r\nman!  After a couple of hours' hard work, they emerged upon the lake,\r\nand here Glynn felt that he was pretty safe, because, in the still\r\nwater, no man could swim nearly as fast as he could paddle.  Besides, it\r\nwas now getting dark, so he pushed out towards a rocky islet on which\r\nthere were only a few small bushes, resolved to take a short rest there,\r\nand then continue his flight under cover of the darkness.\r\n\r\nWhile Glynn carried ashore some biscuit, which was the only thing in the\r\nboat they could eat without cooking, Ailie broke off some branches from\r\nthe low bushes that covered the little rocky islet, and spread them out\r\non a flat rock for a couch; this done, she stood on the top of a large\r\nstone and gazed round upon the calm surface of the beautiful lake, in\r\nthe dark depths of which the stars twinkled as if there were another sky\r\ndown there.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ailie,\" said Glynn, \"come along and have supper.  It's not a very\r\ntempting one, but we must content ourselves with hard fare and a hard\r\nbed to-night, as I dare not light a fire lest the negroes should observe\r\nit and catch us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry for that,\" replied the child; \"for a fire is _so_ nice and\r\ncheery; and it helps to keep off the wild beasts, too, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it does; but there are no wild beasts on such a small rock as\r\nthis, and the sides are luckily too steep for crocodiles to crawl up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we sleep here till morning?\" asked Ailie, munching her hard\r\nbiscuit and drinking her tin pannikinful of cold water with great\r\nrelish, for she was very hungry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" replied Glynn.  \"We must be up and away in an hour at\r\nfarthest.  So, as I see you're about done with your luxurious supper, I\r\npropose that you lie down to rest.\"\r\n\r\nAilie was only too glad to accede to this proposal.  She lay down on the\r\nbranches, and after Glynn had covered her with a blanket, he stretched\r\nhimself on a leopard-skin beside her, and both of them fell asleep in\r\nfive minutes.  The mosquitoes were very savage that night, but the\r\nsleepers were too much fatigued to mind their vicious attacks.\r\n\r\nGlynn slept two hours, and then he wakened with a start, as most persons\r\ndo when they have arranged, before going to sleep, to rise at a certain\r\nhour.  He rose softly, carried the provisions back to the canoe, and in\r\nhis sleepy condition almost stepped upon the head of a huge crocodile,\r\nwhich, ignorant of their presence, had landed its head on the islet in\r\norder to have a snooze.  Then he roused Ailie, and led her, more than\r\nhalf asleep, down to the beach, and lifted her into the canoe, after\r\nwhich he pushed off, and paddled briskly over the still waters of the\r\nstar-lit lake.  Ailie merely yawned during all these proceedings; said,\r\n\"Dear me! is it time to--yeaow! oh, I'm _so_ sleepy;\" mumbled something\r\nabout papa wondering what had become of Jim Scroggles, and about her\r\nbeing convinced that--\"yeaow!--the ship must have lost itself among the\r\nwhales and monkeys;\" and then, dropping her head on the leopard-skins\r\nwith a deep sigh of comfort, she returned to the land of Nod.\r\n\r\nGlynn Proctor worked so well that it was still early in the morning and\r\nquite dark when he arrived at the encampment where they had been made\r\nprisoners.  His heart beat audibly as he approached the dark\r\nlanding-place, and observed no sign of his comrades.  The moment the bow\r\nof the canoe touched the shore, he sprang over the side, and, without\r\ndisturbing the little sleeper, drew it gently up the bank, and fastened\r\nthe bow-rope to a tree; then he hurried to the spot where they had slept\r\nand found all the fires out except one, of which a few dull embers still\r\nremained; but no comrade was visible.\r\n\r\nIt is a felicitous arrangement of our organs of sense, that where one\r\norgan fails to convey to our inward man information regarding the\r\noutward world, another often steps in to supply its place, and perform\r\nthe needful duty.  We have said that Glynn Proctor saw nothing of his\r\ncomrades,--although he gazed earnestly all round the camp--for the very\r\ngood reason that it was almost pitch-dark; but although his eyes were\r\nuseless, his ears were uncommonly acute, and through their\r\ninstrumentality he became cognisant of a sound.  It might have been\r\ndistant thunder, but was too continuous and regular for that.  It might\r\nhave been the distant rumbling of heavy wagons or artillery over a paved\r\nroad; but there were neither wagons nor roads in those African wilds.\r\nIt might have been the prolonged choking of an alligator--it might, in\r\nfact, have been _anything_ in a region like that, where _everything_,\r\nalmost, was curious, and new, and strange, and wild, and unaccountable;\r\nand the listener was beginning to entertain the most uncomfortable ideas\r\nof what it probably was, when a gasp and a peculiar snort apprised him\r\nthat it was a human snore!--at least, if not a human snore, it was that\r\nof some living creature which indulged to a very extravagant degree in\r\nthat curious and altogether objectionable practice.\r\n\r\nStepping cautiously forward on tip-toe, Glynn searched among the leaves\r\nall round the fire, following the direction of the sounds, but nothing\r\nwas to be found; and he experienced a slight feeling of supernatural\r\ndread creeping over him, when a peculiarly loud metallic snore sounded\r\nclear above his head.  Looking up, he beheld by the dull red light of\r\nthe almost extinct fire, the form of Phil Briant, half-seated,\r\nhalf-reclining, on the branch of a tree not ten feet from the ground,\r\nand clasping another branch tightly with both arms.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Ailie, who had awakened, ran up, and caught Glynn by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Briant!\" exclaimed Glynn.\r\n\r\nA very loud snore was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Briant!  Phil Briant, I say; hallo!  Phil!\" shouted Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! howld yer noise will ye,\" muttered the still sleeping\r\nman--\"sno--o--o--o--re!\"\r\n\r\n\"A fall! a fall!--all hands ahoy! tumble up there, tumble up!\" shouted\r\nGlynn, in the nautical tones which he well knew would have their effect\r\nupon his comrade.\r\n\r\nHe was right.  They had more than their usual effect on him.  The\r\ninstant he heard them, Phil Briant shouted--\"Ay, ay, sir!\" and, throwing\r\nhis legs over the side of what he supposed to be his hammock, he came\r\ndown bodily on what he supposed to be the deck with a whack that caused\r\nhim to utter an involuntary but tremendous howl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! och! oh! murther! oh whirra!\" he cried, as he lay half-stunned.\r\n\"Oh, it's kilt I am entirely--dead as mutton at last, an' no mistake.\r\nSure I might have knowd it--och! worse luck!  Didn't yer poor owld\r\nmother tell ye, Phil, that ye'd come to a bad end--she did--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are ye badly hurt?\" said Glynn, stooping over his friend in real alarm.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice Briant ceased his wails, rose into a sitting\r\nposture, shaded his eyes with his hand (a most unnecessary proceeding\r\nunder the circumstances), and stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, Phil; all right, and Ailie.  We've escaped, and got safe back\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's jokin' ye are,\" said Briant, with the imbecile smile of a man who\r\nonly half believes what he actually sees.  \"I'm draimin', that's it.  Go\r\naway, avic, an' don't be botherin' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite true, though, I assure you, my boy.  I've managed to give\r\nthe niggers the slip; and here's Ailie, too, all safe, and ready to\r\nconvince you of the fact.\"\r\n\r\nPhil Briant looked at one and then at the other in unbounded amazement\r\nfor a few seconds, after which he gave a short laugh as if of pity for\r\nhis own weakness, and his face assumed a mild aspect as he said softly,\r\n\"It's all a draim, av coorse it is!\"  He even turned away his eyes for a\r\nmoment in order to give the vision time to dissipate.  But on looking\r\nround again, there it was, as palpable as ever.  Faith in the fidelity\r\nof his own eyesight returned in a moment, and Phil Briant, forgetting\r\nhis bodily pains, sprang to his feet with a roar of joy, seized Ailie in\r\nhis arms and kissed her, embraced Glynn Proctor with a squeeze like that\r\nof a loving bear, and then began to dance an Irish jig, quite regardless\r\nof the fact that the greater part of it was performed in the fire, the\r\nembers of which he sent flying in all directions like a display of\r\nfireworks.  He cheered, too, now and then like a maniac--\"Oh, happy day!\r\nI've found ye, have I? after all me trouble, too!  Hooray! an' wan\r\nchair more for luck.  Av me sowl only don't lape clane out o' me body,\r\nit's meself'll be thankful!  But, sure--I'm forgittin'--\"\r\n\r\nBriant paused suddenly in the midst of his uproarious dance, and seized\r\na burning stick, which he attempted to blow into a flame with intense\r\nvehemence of action.  Having succeeded, he darted towards an open space\r\na few yards off, in the centre of which lay a large pile of dry sticks.\r\nTo these he applied the lighted brand, and the next instant a glare of\r\nruddy flame leaped upwards, and sent a shower of sparks high above the\r\nforest trees into the sky.  He then returned, panting a good deal, but\r\nmuch composed, and said--\"Now, darlints, come an' help me to gather the\r\nbits o' stick; somebody's bin scatterin' them all over the place, they\r\nhave, bad luck to them! an' then ye'll sit down and talk a bit, an' tell\r\nme all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what's the fire for?\" asked Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ye may say that,\" added Glynn; \"we don't need such a huge bonfire\r\nas that to cook our supper with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! be aisy, do.  It'll do its work; small doubt o' that.  The cap'n,\r\npoor man, ye know, is a'most deranged, an' they're every one o' them off\r\nat this good minute scourin' the woods lookin' for ye.  O, then, it's\r\nsore hearts we've had this day!  An' wan was sent wan way, an' wan\r\nanother, an' the cap'n his-self he wint up the river, and, before he\r\ngoes, he says to me, says he, `Briant, you'll stop here and watch the\r\ncamp, for maybe they'll come wanderin' back to it, av they've bin and\r\nlost theirselves; an' mind ye don't lave it or go to slape.  An' if they\r\ndo come, or ye hear any news o' them, jist you light up a great fire,\r\nan' I'll be on the look-out, an' we'll all on us come back as fast as we\r\ncan.'  Now, that's the truth, an' the whole truth, an' nothin' but the\r\ntruth, as the judge said to the witness when he swore at him.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a comforting piece of information to Glynn and Ailie, so,\r\nwithout further delay, they assisted their overjoyed comrade to collect\r\nthe scattered embers of the fire and boil the kettle.  In this work they\r\nwere all the more energetic that the pangs of hunger were beginning to\r\nremind them of the frugal and scanty nature of their last meal.\r\n\r\nThe bonfire did its work effectually.  From all parts of the forest to\r\nwhich they had wandered, the party came, dropping in one by one to\r\ncongratulate the lost and found pair.  Last of all came Captain Dunning\r\nand Tim Rokens, for the harpooner had vowed he would \"stick to the cap'n\r\nthrough thick and thin.\"  Tim kept his word faithfully.  Through thick\r\ntangled brakes and thin mud-swamps did he follow his wretched commander\r\nthat night until he could scarcely stand for fatigue, or keep his eyes\r\nopen for sleep; and when the captain rushed into the camp at last, and\r\nclasped his sobbing child to his heart, Tim Rokens rushed in along with\r\nhim, halted beside him, thrust his hands into his pockets, and looked\r\non, while his eyes blinked with irresistible drowsiness, and his\r\nmud-bespattered visage beamed with excessive joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL REMARKS ON \"LIFE\"--A MONKEY SHOT AND A MONKEY FOUND--JACKO\r\nDESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\"Such is life!\"  There is deep meaning in that expression, though it is\r\ngenerally applied in a bantering manner to life in all its phases, under\r\nall its peculiar and diversified circumstances.  Taking a particular\r\nview of things in general, we may say of life that it is composed of\r\ndiverse and miscellaneous materials--the grave and the gay; the sad and\r\nthe comic; the extraordinary and the commonplace; the flat and the\r\npiquant; the heavy and the light; the religious and the profane; the\r\nbright and the dark; the shadow and the sunshine.  All these, and a\r\ngreat deal more, similar as well as dissimilar, enter into the\r\ncomposition of what we familiarly term life.\r\n\r\nThese elements, too, are not arranged according to order, at least,\r\norder that is perceptible to our feeble human understandings.  That\r\nthere does exist both order and harmony is undeniable; but we cannot see\r\nit.  The elements appear to be miscellaneously intermingled--to be\r\naccidentally thrown together; yet, while looking at them in detail there\r\nseems to us a good deal of unreasonable and chaotic jumble, in regarding\r\nthem as a whole, or as a series of wholes, it becomes apparent that\r\nthere is a certain harmony of arrangement that may be termed\r\nkaleidoscopically beautiful; and when, in the course of events, we are\r\ncalled to the contemplation of something grand or lovely, followed\r\nrather abruptly by something curiously contemptible or absurd, we are\r\ntempted to give utterance to the thoughts that are too complicated and\r\ndeep for rapid analysis, in the curt expression \"Such is life.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician invites his friends to a social _reunion_.  He chats and\r\nlaughs at the passing jest, or takes part in the music--the glee, or the\r\ncomic song.  A servant whispers in his ear.  Ten minutes elapse, and he\r\nis standing by the bed of death.  He watches the flickering flame; he\r\nendeavours to relieve the agonised frame; he wipes the cold sweat from\r\nthe pale brow, and moistens the dry lips, or pours words of true,\r\nearnest, tender comfort into the ears of the bereaved.  The contrast\r\nhere is very violent and sudden.  We have chosen, perhaps, the most\r\nstriking instance of the kind that is afforded in the experience of men;\r\nyet such, in a greater or less degree, is life, in the case of every one\r\nborn into this wonderful world of ours, and such, undoubtedly, it was\r\nintended to be.  \"There is a time for all things.\"  We were made capable\r\nof laughing and crying; therefore, these being sinless indulgences in\r\nthe abstract, we _ought_ to laugh and cry.  And one of our great aims in\r\nlife should be to get our hearts and affections so trained that we shall\r\nlaugh and cry at the right time.  It may be well to remark, in passing,\r\nthat we should avoid, if possible, doing both at once.\r\n\r\nNow, such being life, we consider that we shall be doing no violence to\r\nthe harmonies of life if we suddenly, and without further preface,\r\ntransport the reader into the middle of next day, and a considerable\r\ndistance down the river up which we have for some time been travelling.\r\n\r\nHere he (or she) will find Ailie and her father, and the whole party in\r\nfact, floating calmly and pleasantly down the stream in their canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this is wot I do enjoy,\" said Rokens, laying down his paddle and\r\nwiping the perspiration from his brow; \"it's the pleasantest sort o'\r\nthing I've known since I went to sea.\"\r\n\r\nTo judge from the profuse perspiration that flowed from his brow, and\r\nfrom the excessive redness of his face, one would suppose that Rokens'\r\nexperience of \"pleasant sort o' things\" had not hitherto been either\r\nextensive or deep.  But the man meant what he said, and a well-known\r\nproverb clears up the mystery--\"What's one man's meat is another's\r\npoison!\"  Hard work, violent physical exertion, and excessive heat were\r\nRokens' delight, and, whatever may be the opinion of flabby-muscled,\r\nflat individuals, there can be no reasonable doubt that Rokens meant it,\r\nwhen he added, emphatically, \"It's fuss-rate; tip-top; A1 on Lloyd's,\r\nthat's a fact!\"\r\n\r\nPhil Briant, on hearing this, laid down his paddle, also wiped his\r\nforehead with the sleeve of his coat, and exclaimed--\"Ditto, says I.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Glynn laughed, and Jim Scroggles grunted (this being _his_\r\nmethod of laughing), and the captain shook his head, and said--\r\n\r\n\"P'r'aps it is, my lads, a pleasant sort o' thing, but the sooner we're\r\nout of it the better.  I've no notion of a country where the natives\r\nmurder poor little boys in cold blood, and carry off your goods and\r\nchattels at a moment's notice.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain looked at Ailie as he spoke, thereby implying that she was\r\npart of the \"goods and chattels\" referred to.\r\n\r\n\"Shure it's a fact; an' without sayin' by yer lave, too,\" added Briant,\r\nwho had a happy facility of changing his opinion on the shortest notice\r\nto accommodate himself to circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the monkey!\" screamed Ailie.\r\n\r\nNow as Ailie screamed this just as Briant ceased to speak, and,\r\nmoreover, pointed, or appeared to point, straight into that individual's\r\nface, it was natural to suppose that the child was becoming somewhat\r\npersonal--the more so that Briant's visage, when wrinkled up and tanned\r\nby the glare of a tropical sun, was not unlike to that of a large\r\nbaboon.  But every one knew that Ailie was a gentle, well-behaved\r\ncreature--except, perhaps, when she was seized with one of her gleeful\r\nfits that bordered sometimes upon mischief--so that instead of supposing\r\nthat she had made a personal attack on the unoffending Irishman, the\r\nboat's crew instantly directed their eyes close past Briant's face and\r\ninto the recesses of the wood beyond, where they saw a sight that filled\r\nthem with surprise.\r\n\r\nA large-leaved tree of the palm species overhung the banks of the river\r\nand formed a support to a wild vine and several bright-flowering\r\nparasitical plants that drooped in graceful luxuriance from its branches\r\nand swept the stream, which at that place was dark, smooth, and deep.\r\nOn the top of this tree, in among the branches, sat a monkey--at least\r\nso Ailie called it; but the term ape or baboon would have been more\r\nappropriate, for the creature was a very large one, and, if the\r\nexpression of its countenance indicated in any degree the feelings of\r\nits heart, also a very fierce one--an exceedingly ferocious one indeed.\r\nThis monkey's face was as black as coal, and its two deep-seated eyes\r\nwere, if possible, blacker than coal.  Its head was bald, but the rest\r\nof its body was plentifully covered with hair.\r\n\r\nNow this monkey was evidently caught--taken by surprise--for instead of\r\ntrying to escape as the canoe approached, it sat there chattering and\r\nexhibiting its teeth to a degree that was quite fiendish, not to say--\r\nunder the circumstances--unnecessary.  As the canoe dropped slowly down\r\nthe river, it became obvious that this monkey had a baby, for a very\r\nsmall and delicate creature was seen clinging round the big one's waist\r\nwith its little hands grasping tightly the long hair on the mother's\r\nsides, its arms being much too short to encircle her body.  Ailie's\r\nheart leapt with an emotion of tender delight as she observed that the\r\nbaby monkey's face was white and sweet-looking; yes, we might even go\r\nthe length of saying that, for a monkey, it was actually pretty.  But it\r\nhad a subdued, sorrowful look that was really touching to behold.  It\r\nseemed as though that infantine monkey had, in the course of its brief\r\ncareer, been subjected to every species of affliction, to every\r\nimaginable kind of heart-crushing sorrow, and had remained deeply meek\r\nand humble under it all.  Only for one brief instant did a different\r\nexpression cross its melancholy face.  That was when it first caught\r\nsight of the canoe.  Then it exposed its very small teeth and gums after\r\nthe fashion of its mother; but repentance seemed to follow instantly,\r\nfor the sad look, mixed with a dash of timidity, resumed its place, and\r\nit buried its face in its mother's bosom.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a loud report.  A bullet whistled through the\r\nair and struck the old monkey in the breast.  We are glad to say, for\r\nthe credit of our sailors, that a howl of indignation immediately\r\nfollowed, and more than one fist was raised to smite the trader who had\r\nfired the shot.  But Captain Dunning called the men to order in a\r\nperemptory voice, while every eye was turned towards the tree to observe\r\nthe effect of the shot.  As for Ailie, she sat breathless with horror at\r\nthe cruelty of the act.\r\n\r\nThe old monkey gave vent to a loud yell, clutched her breast with her\r\nhands, sprang wildly into the air, and fell to the ground.  Her leap was\r\nso violent that the young one was shaken off and fell some distance from\r\nits poor mother, which groaned once or twice and then died.  The baby\r\nseemed unhurt.  Gathering itself nimbly up, it ran away from the men who\r\nhad now landed, but who stood still, by the captain's orders, to watch\r\nits motions.  Looking round, it observed its mother's form lying on the\r\nground, and at once ran towards it and buried its little face in her\r\nbreast, at which sight Ailie began to cry quietly.  In a few seconds the\r\nlittle monkey got up and gently pawed the old one; then, on receiving no\r\nsign of recognition, it uttered a faint wail, something like\r\n\"Wee-wee-wee-wee-oo!\" and again hid its face in the breast of its dead\r\nparent.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the poor cratur,\" said Briant, in a tone of voice that betrayed his\r\nemotion.  \"O, why did ye kill her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me ketch 'im?\" said Bumble, looking inquiringly at the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do!\" answered Ailie, with a sob.\r\n\r\nThe negro deemed this permission sufficient, for he instantly sprang\r\nforward, and throwing a piece of net over the little monkey, secured it.\r\n\r\nNow the way in which that baby monkey struggled and kicked and shrieked,\r\nwhen it found itself a prisoner, was perfectly wonderful to see!  It\r\nseemed as if the strength of fifty little monkeys had been compressed\r\ninto its diminutive body, and King Bumble had to exert all his strength\r\nin order to hold the creature while he carried it into the canoe.  Once\r\nsafely there and in the middle of the stream, it was let loose.  The\r\nfirst thing it did on being set free was to give a shriek of triumph,\r\nfor monkeys, like men, when at last _allowed_ to do that which they have\r\nlong struggled in vain to accomplish, usually take credit for the\r\nachievement of their own success.\r\n\r\nIts next impulse was to look round at the faces of the men in search of\r\nits mother; but the poor mother was now lying dead covered with a cloth\r\nin the bottom of the canoe, so the little monkey turned from one to\r\nanother with disappointment in its glance and then uttered a low wail of\r\nsorrow.  Glynn Proctor affirmed positively that it looked twice at Phil\r\nBriant and even made a motion towards him; but we rather suspect that\r\nGlynn was jesting.  Certain it is, however, that it looked long and\r\nearnestly at Ailie, and there is little doubt that, young though it was,\r\nit was able to distinguish something in her tender gaze of affection and\r\npity that proved attractive.  It did not, however, accept her invitation\r\nto go to her, although given in the most persuasive tones of her silver\r\nvoice, and when any of the men tried to pat its head, it displayed such\r\na row of sharp little teeth and made such a fierce demonstration of its\r\nintention to bite, that they felt constrained to leave it alone.  At\r\nlast Ailie held her hand towards it and said--\r\n\r\n\"Won't it come to me, dear, sweet pet?  _Do_ come; I'll be as kind to\r\nyou almost as your poor mother.\"  The monkey looked at the child, but\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Come, monkey, dear puggy, _do_ come,\" repeated Ailie, in a still more\r\ninsinuating voice.\r\n\r\nThe monkey still declined to \"come,\" but it looked very earnestly at the\r\nchild, and trembled a good deal, and said, \"Oo-oo-wee; oo-oo-wee!\"\r\n\r\nAs Ailie did not quite understand this, she said, \"Poor thing!\" and\r\nagain held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Try it with a small taste o' mate,\" suggested Briant.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said the captain.  \"Hand me the biscuit-bag, Glynn.  There,\r\nnow, Ailie, try it with that.\"\r\n\r\nAilie took the piece of biscuit offered to her by her father, and held\r\nit out to the monkey, who advanced with nervous caution, and very\r\nslowly, scratching its side the while.  Putting out its very small hand,\r\nit touched the biscuit, then drew back the hand suddenly, and made a\r\nvariety of sounds, accompanied by several peculiar contortions of\r\nvisage, all of which seemed to say, \"Don't hurt me, now; _don't_ deceive\r\nme, pray.\"  Again it put forth its hand, and took the biscuit, and ate\r\nit in a very great hurry indeed; that is to say, it stuffed it into the\r\nbags in its cheeks.\r\n\r\nAilie gave it a bit more biscuit, which it received graciously, and\r\ndevoured voraciously; whereupon she put forth her hand, and sought to\r\npat the little creature on the head.  The attempt was successful.  With\r\nmany slight grins, as though to say, \"Take care, now, else I'll bite,\"\r\nthe small monkey allowed Ailie to pat its head and stroke its back.\r\nThen it permitted her to take hold of its hand, and draw it towards her.\r\nIn a few minutes it showed evident symptoms of a desire to be patted\r\nagain, and at length it drew timidly towards the child, and took hold of\r\nher hand in both of its delicate pink paws.  Ailie felt quite tenderly\r\ntowards the creature, and stroked its head again, whereupon it seemed\r\nsuddenly to cast aside all fear.  It leaped upon her knee, put its\r\nslender arms as far round her neck as possible, said \"Oo-oo-wee!\"\r\nseveral times in a very sad tone of voice, and laid its head upon her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for poor Ailie; she thought of the dead mother of this\r\ninfant monkey, and wept as she stroked its hairy little head and\r\nshoulders.  From that time forward the monkey adopted Ailie as its\r\nmother, and Ailie adopted the monkey as her child.\r\n\r\nNow the behaviour of that monkey during the remainder of that voyage was\r\nwonderful.  Oh, you know, it was altogether preposterous, to say the\r\nvery least of it.  Affection, which displayed itself in a desire to\r\nconciliate the favour of every one, was ingrained in its bones; while\r\ndeception, which was evinced in a constant effort to appear to be intent\r\nupon one thing, when it was really bent upon another, was incorporated\r\nwith its marrow!\r\n\r\nAt first it was at war with every one, excepting, of course, Ailie, its\r\nadopted mother; but soon it became accustomed to the men, and in the\r\ncourse of a few days would go to any one who called it.  Phil Briant was\r\na particular favourite; so was Rokens, with whose black beard it played\r\nin evident delight, running its slender fingers through it,\r\ndisentangling the knots and the matted portions which the owner of the\r\nbeard had never yet been able to disentangle in a satisfactory way for\r\nhimself; and otherwise acting the part of a barber and hairdresser to\r\nthat bold mariner, much to his amusement, and greatly to the delight and\r\nadmiration of the whole party.\r\n\r\nTo say that that small monkey had a face, would be to assert what was\r\nunquestionably true, but what, also, was very far short of the whole\r\ntruth.  No one ever could make up his mind exactly as to how many faces\r\nit had.  If you looked at it at any particular time, and then shut your\r\neyes and opened them a moment after, that monkey, as far as expression\r\nwent, had another and a totally different face.  Repeat the operation,\r\nand it had a third face; continue the process, and it had a fourth face;\r\nand so on, until you lost count altogether of its multitudinous faces.\r\nNow it was grave and pensive; anon it was blazing with amazement; again\r\nit bristled with indignation; then it glared with anger, and presently\r\nit was all serene--blended love and wrinkles.  Of all these varied\r\nexpressions, that of commingled surprise and indignation was the most\r\namusing, because these emotions had the effect of not only opening its\r\neyes and its mouth to the form of three excessively round O's, but also\r\nraised a small tuft of hair just above its forehead into a bristling\r\nposition, and threw its brow into an innumerable series of wrinkles.\r\nThis complex expression was of frequent occurrence, for its feelings\r\nwere tender and sensitive, so that it lived in the firm belief that its\r\nnew friends (always excepting Ailie) constantly wished to insult it; and\r\nwas afflicted with a chronic state of surprise at the cruelty, and of\r\nindignation at the injustice, of men who could wantonly injure the\r\nfeelings of so young, and especially so small a monkey.\r\n\r\nWhen the men called it, it used to walk up to them with calm, deliberate\r\ncondescension in its air; when Ailie held out her hand, it ran on its\r\ntwo legs, and being eager in its affections, it held out its arms in\r\norder to be caught up.  As to food, that monkey was not particular.  It\r\nseemed to be omnivorous.  Certain it is that it never refused anything,\r\nbut more than once it was observed quietly to throw away things that it\r\ndid not relish.  Once, in an unguarded moment, it accepted and chewed a\r\nsmall piece of tobacco; after which it made a variety of entirely new\r\nfaces, and became very sick indeed--so sick that its adopted mother\r\nbegan to fear she was about to lose her child; but after vomiting a good\r\ndeal, and moaning piteously for several days, it gradually recovered,\r\nand from that time entertained an unquenchable hatred for tobacco, and\r\nfor the man who had given it to him, who happened to be Jim Scroggles.\r\n\r\nAilie, being of a romantic temperament, named her monkey Albertino, but\r\nthe sailors called him Jacko, and their name ultimately became the\r\nwell-known one of the little foundling, for Ailie was not obstinate; so,\r\nseeing that the sailors did not or could not remember Albertino, she\r\nsoon gave in, and styled her pet Jacko to the end of the chapter, with\r\nwhich piece of information we shall conclude _this_ chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nRENCONTRE WITH SLAVE-TRADERS--ON BOARD AGAIN--A START, A MISFORTUNE, A\r\nGHOST STORY, A MISTAKE, AND AN INVITATION TO DINNER.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day after the capture of Jacko, as the\r\ncanoe was descending the river and drawing near to the sea-coast, much\r\nto the delight of everyone--for the heat of the interior had begun to\r\ngrow unbearable--a ship's boat was observed moored to the wharf near the\r\nslave-station which they had passed on the way up.  At first it was\r\nsupposed to be one of the boats of the _Red Eric_, but on a nearer\r\napproach this proved to be an erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Wot can it be a-doin' of here?\" inquired Tim Rokens, in an abstracted\r\ntone of voice, as if he put the question to himself, and therefore did\r\nnot expect an answer.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it's a slaver's boat,\" replied the trader; \"they often come up\r\nhere for cargoes of niggers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! the blackguards!\" exclaimed Phil Briant, all his blood rising at\r\nthe mere mention of the horrible traffic; \"couldn't we land, capting,\r\nand give them a lickin'?  I'll engage meself to put six at laste o' the\r\nspalpeens on their beam-ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Phil, we shan't land for that purpose; but we'll land for some\r\ngunpowder an' a barrel or two of plantains; so give way, lads.\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment the bow of the canoe slid upon the mud-bank of the\r\nriver close to the slaver's boat, which was watched by a couple of the\r\nmost villainous-looking men that ever took part in that disgraceful\r\ntraffic.  They were evidently Portuguese sailors, and the scowl of their\r\nbronzed faces, when they saw the canoe approach the landing-place,\r\nshowed that they had no desire to enter into amicable converse with the\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the attention of the travellers was drawn to a gang of\r\nslaves who approached the wharf, chained together by the neck, and\r\nguarded by the crew of the Portuguese boat.  Ailie looked on with a\r\nfeeling of dread that induced her to cling to her father's hand, while\r\nthe men stood with folded arms, compressed lips, and knitted brows.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage up they had landed at this station, and had seen the\r\nslaves in their places of confinement.  The poor creatures were\r\napparently happy at that time, and seemed totally indifferent to their\r\nsad fate; but their aspect was very different now.  They were being\r\nhurried away, they knew not whither, by strangers whom they had been\r\ntaught to believe were monsters of cruelty besides being cannibals, and\r\nwho had purchased them for the purpose of killing them and eating their\r\nbodies.  The wild, terrified looks of the men, and the subdued looks and\r\ntrembling gait of the women showed that they expected no mercy at the\r\nhands of their captors.\r\n\r\nThey hung back a little as they drew near to the boat, whereupon one of\r\ntheir conductors, who seemed to be in command of the party, uttered a\r\nfierce exclamation in Portuguese, and struck several of the men and\r\nwomen indiscriminately severe blows with his fists.  In a few minutes\r\nthey were all placed in the boat, and the crew had partly embarked, when\r\nPhil Briant, unable to restrain himself, muttered between his teeth to\r\nthe Portuguese commander as he passed--\r\n\r\n\"Ye imp o' darkness, av I only had ye in the ring for tshwo minits--jist\r\ntshwo--ah thin, wouldn't I polish ye off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fat you say, sare?\" cried the man, turning fiercely towards Briant, and\r\nswearing at him in bad English.\r\n\r\n\"Say, is it?  Oh, then _there's_ a translation for ye, that's understood\r\nin all lingos.\"\r\n\r\nPhil shook his clenched fist as close as possible to the nose of the\r\nPortuguese commander without actually coming into contact with that\r\nhooked and prominent organ.\r\n\r\nThe man started back and drew his knife, at the same time calling to\r\nseveral of his men, who advanced with their drawn knives.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" cried Briant, and a jovial smile overspread his rough countenance\r\nas he sprang to a clear spot of ground and rolled up both sleeves of his\r\nshirt to the shoulders, thereby displaying a pair of arms that might, at\r\na rapid glance, have been mistaken for a pair of legs--\"that's yer game,\r\nis it? won't I stave in yer planks! won't I shiver yer timbers, and\r\nknock out yer daylights, bless yer purty faces!  I didn't think ye had\r\nit in ye; come on darlints--toothpicks and all--as many as ye like; the\r\nmore the better--wan at a time, or all at wance, it don't matter, not\r\nthe laste, be no manes!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Briant gave utterance to these liberal invitations, he performed a\r\nspecies of revolving dance, and flourished his enormous fists in so\r\nludicrous a manner, that despite the serious nature of the fray the two\r\nparties were likely to be speedily engaged in, his comrades could not\r\nrestrain their laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Go it, Pat!\" cried one.\r\n\r\n\"True blue!\" shouted another.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" cried Captain Dunning, in a voice that enforced obedience.\r\n\"Get into the canoe, Briant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! capting,\" exclaimed the wrathful Irishman, reproachfully, \"sure ye\r\nwouldn't spile the fun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the canoe, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! capting dear, jist wan round!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the canoe, I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it all in four minits an' wan quarter, av ye'll only shut yer\r\neyes,\" pleaded Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Obey orders, will you?\" cried the captain, in a voice there was no\r\nmistaking.\r\n\r\nBriant indignantly thrust his fists into his breeches pockets, and\r\nrolled slowly down towards the canoe, as--to use one of his own\r\nfavourite expressions--sulky as a bear with a broken head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the captain stepped up to the Portuguese sailors and told them\r\nto mind their own business, and let _honest_ men alone; adding, that if\r\nthey did not take his advice, he would first give them a licking and\r\nthen pitch them all into the river.\r\n\r\nThis last remark caused Briant to prick up his ears and withdraw his\r\nfists from their inglorious retirement, in the fond hope that there\r\nmight still be work for them to do; but on observing that the\r\nPortuguese, acting on the principle that discretion is the better part\r\nof valour, had taken the advice and were returning to their own boat, he\r\nrelapsed into the sulks, and seated himself doggedly in his place in the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nDuring all this little scene, which was enacted much more rapidly than\r\nit had been described, master Jacko, having escaped from the canoe, had\r\nbeen seated near the edge of the wharf, looking on, apparently, with\r\ndeep interest.  Just as the Portuguese turned away to embark in their\r\nboat, Ailie's eye alighted on her pet; at the same moment the foot of\r\nthe Portuguese commander alighted on her pet's tail.  Now the tails of\r\nall animals seem to be peculiarly sensitive.  Jacko's certainly was so,\r\nfor he instantly uttered a shriek of agony, which was as quickly\r\nresponded to by its adopted mother in a scream of alarm as she sprang\r\nforward to the rescue.  When one unintentionally treads on the tail of\r\nany animal and thereby evokes a yell, he is apt to start and trip--in\r\nnine cases out of ten he does trip.  The Portuguese commander tripped\r\nupon this occasion.  In staggering out of the monkey's way he well-nigh\r\ntumbled over Ailie, and in seeking to avoid her, he tumbled over the\r\nedge of the wharf into the river.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the appearance of this redoubtable slave-buying\r\nhero before and after his involuntary immersion was so remarkable and\r\ngreat that his most intimate friend would have failed to recognise him.\r\nHe went down into the slimy liquid an ill-favoured Portuguese, clad in\r\nwhite duck; he came up a worse-favoured monstrosity, clothed in mud!\r\nEven his own rascally comrades grinned at him for a moment, but their\r\ngrins changed into a scowl of anger when they heard the peals of\r\nlaughter that burst from the throats of their enemies.  As for Briant,\r\nhe absolutely hugged himself with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Och! ye've got it, ye have,\" he exclaimed, at intervals.  \"Happy day!\r\nwho'd ha' thought it? to see him tumbled in the mud after all by purty\r\nlittle Ailie and Jacko.  Come here to me Jacko, owld coon.  Oh, ye swate\r\ncratur!\"\r\n\r\nBriant seized the monkey, and squeezed it to his breast, and kissed it--\r\nyes, he actually kissed its nose in the height of his glee, and\r\ncontinued to utter incoherent exclamations, and to perpetrate\r\nincongruous absurdities, until long after they had descended the river\r\nand left the muddy Portuguese and his comrades far behind them.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the party were once more safe and sound on board the\r\n_Red Eric_, where they found everything repaired, and the ship in a fit\r\nstate to proceed to sea immediately.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty King Bumble was introduced to the steward, then to the cook,\r\nand then to the caboose.  Master Jacko was introduced to the ship's crew\r\nand to his quarters, which consisted of a small box filled with straw,\r\nand was lashed near the foot of the mizzen-mast.  These introductions\r\nhaving been made, the men who had accompanied their commander on his\r\nlate excursion into the interior, went forward and regaled their\r\nmessmates for hours with anecdotes of their travels in the wilds of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nIt is well-known, and generally acknowledged, that all sublunary things,\r\npleasant as well as unpleasant, must come to an end.  In the course of\r\ntwo days more the sojourn of the crew of the _Red Eric_ on the coast of\r\nAfrica came to a termination.  Having taken in supplies of fresh\r\nprovisions, the anchor was weighed, and the ship stood out to sea with\r\nthe first of the ebb tide.  It was near sunset when the sails were\r\nhoisted and filled by a gentle land breeze, and the captain had just\r\npromised Ailie that he would show her blue water again by breakfast-time\r\nnext morning, when a slight tremor passed through the vessel's hull,\r\ncausing the captain to shout, with a degree of vigour that startled\r\neveryone on board, \"All hands ahoy! lower away the boats, Mr Millons,\r\nwe're hard and fast aground on a mud-bank!\"\r\n\r\nThe boats were lowered away with all speed, and the sails dewed up\r\ninstantly, but the _Red Eric_ remained as immovable as the bank on which\r\nshe had run aground; there was, therefore, no recourse but to wait\r\npatiently for the rising tide to float her off again.  Fortunately the\r\nbank was soft and the wind light, else it might have gone ill with the\r\ngood ship.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any conceivable condition so favourable to quiet\r\nconfidential conversation and story-telling as the one in which the men\r\nof the whale-ship now found themselves.  The night was calm and dark,\r\nbut beautiful, for a host of stars sparkled in the sable sky, and\r\ntwinkled up from the depths of the dark ocean.  The land breeze had\r\nfallen, and there was scarcely any sound to break the surrounding\r\nstillness except the lipping water as it kissed the black hull of the\r\nship.  A dim, scarce perceptible light rendered every object on board\r\nmysterious and unaccountably large.\r\n\r\n\"Wot a night for a ghost story,\" observed Jim Scroggles, who stood with\r\na group of the men, who were seated on and around the windlass.\r\n\r\n\"I don't b'lieve in ghosts,\" said Dick Barnes stoutly, in a tone of\r\nvoice that rendered the veracity of his assertion, to say the least of\r\nit, doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"Nother do I,\" remarked Nikel Sling, who had just concluded his culinary\r\noperations for the day, and sought to employ his brief interval of\r\nrelaxation in social intercourse with his fellows.  Being engaged in\r\nministering to the animal wants of his comrades all day, he felt himself\r\nentitled to enjoy a little of the \"feast of reason and the flow of soul\"\r\nat night:\r\n\r\n\"No more duv I,\" added Phil Briant firmly, at the same time hitting his\r\nthigh a slap with his open hand that caused all round him to start.\r\n\r\n\"You don't, don't you?\" said Tim Rokens, addressing the company\r\ngenerally, and looking round gravely, while he pushed the glowing\r\ntobacco into his pipe with the point of a marline-spike.\r\n\r\nTo this there was a chorus of \"Noes,\" but a close observer would have\r\nnoticed that nearly the whole conversation was carried on in low tones,\r\nand that many a glance was cast behind, as if these bold sceptics more\r\nthan half expected all the ghosts that did happen to exist to seize them\r\nthen and there and carry them off as a punishment for their unbelief.\r\n\r\nTim Rokens drew a few whiffs of his pipe, and looked round gravely\r\nbefore he again spoke; then he put the following momentous question,\r\nwith the air of a man who knew he could overturn his adversary whatever\r\nhis reply should be--\r\n\r\n\"An' why don't ye b'lieve in 'em?\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot say positively that Tim Rokens put the question to Jim\r\nScroggles, but it is certain that Jim Scroggles accepted the question as\r\naddressed to him, and answered in reply--\r\n\r\n\"'Cause why?  I never seed a ghost, an' nobody never seed a ghost, an' I\r\ndon't b'lieve in what I can't see.\"\r\n\r\nJim said this as if he thought the position incontestable.  Tim regarded\r\nhim with a prolonged stare, but for some time said nothing.  At last he\r\nemitted several strong puffs of smoke, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Young man, did you ever _see_ your own mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, in course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did anybody else ever see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cer'nly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then of course you don't believe in it!\" added Rokens, while a slight\r\nsmile curled his upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe men chuckled a good deal at Jim's confusion, while he in vain\r\nattempted to explain that the two ideas were not parallel by any means.\r\nAt this juncture, Phil Briant came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\"Ah now, git out,\" said he.  \"I agree with Jim intirely; an' Tim Rokens\r\nisn't quite so cliver as he thinks.  Now look here, lads, here's how it\r\nstands, 'xactly.  Jim says he never seed his own mind--very good; and he\r\nsays as how nobody else niver seed it nother; well, and wot then?  Don't\r\nyou observe it's 'cause he han't got none at all to see?  He han't got\r\neven the ghost of one, so how could ye expect anybody to see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hold yer noise, Paddy,\" exclaimed Dick Barnes, \"an' let's have a\r\nghost story from Tim Rokens.  He b'lieves in ghosts, anyhow, an' could\r\ngive us a yarn about 'em, I knows, if he likes.  Come along now, Tim,\r\nlike a good fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's it,\" cried Briant; \"give us a stiff 'un now.  Don't be\r\nafeard to skear us, old boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can give ye a yarn about ghosts, cer'nly,\" said Tim Rokens,\r\nlooking into the bowl of his pipe in order to make sure that it was\r\nsufficiently charged to last out the story.  \"I'll tell ye of a ghost I\r\nonce seed and knocked down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knocked down!\" cried Nikel Sling in surprise; \"why, I allers thought as\r\nhow ghosts was spirits, an' couldn't be knocked down or cotched\r\nneither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied Rokens; \"ghosts is made of all sorts o' things--\r\nbrass, and iron, and linen, and buntin', and timber; it wos a brass\r\nghost the feller that I'm goin' to tell ye about--\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Sling,\" interrupted Briant, \"av ghosts wos spirits, as you\r\nthought they wos, would they be allowed into the State of Maine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Phil, shut up, do!  Now then, Tim, fire away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" began Rokens, with great deliberation, \"it was on a\r\nVednesday night as it happened.  I had bin out at supper with a friend\r\nthat night, and we'd had a glass or two o' grog; for ye see, lads, it\r\nwas some years ago, afore I tuk to temp'rance.  I had a long way to go\r\nover a great dark moor afore I could git to the place where I lodged, so\r\nI clapped on all sail to git over the moor, seein' the moon would go\r\ndown soon; but it wouldn't do: the moon set when I wos in the very\r\nmiddle of the moor, and as the road wasn't over good, I wos in a state\r\no' confumble lest I should lose it altogether.  I looks round in all\r\ndirections, but I couldn't see nothin'--cause why? there wasn't nothin'\r\nto be seen.  It was 'orrid dark, I can tell ye.  Jist one or two stars\r\na-shinin', like half-a-dozen farden dips in a great church; they only\r\nmade darkness wisible.  I began to feel all over a cur'ous sort o'\r\npeculiar unaccountableness, which it ain't easy to explain, but is most\r\noncommon disagreeable to feel.  It wos very still, too--desperate still.\r\nThe beatin' o' my own heart sounded quite loud, and I heer'd the\r\ntickin' o' my watch goin' like the click of a church clock.  Oh, it was\r\nawful!\"\r\n\r\nAt this point in the story the men crept closer together, and listened\r\nwith intense earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Suddently,\" continued Rokens--\"for things in sich circumstances always\r\ncomes suddently--suddently I seed somethin' black jump up right ahead o'\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHere Rokens paused.\r\n\r\n\"Wot was it?\" inquired Gurney, in a solemn whisper.\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" resumed Rokens slowly, \"the stump of a old tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought it had been the ghost,\" said Gurney, somewhat relieved,\r\nfor that fat little Jack-tar fully believed in apparitions, and always\r\nlistened to a ghost story in fear and trembling.\r\n\r\n\"No it wasn't the ghost; it was the stump of a tree.  Well, I set sail\r\nagain, an' presently I sees a great white thing risin' up ahead o' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! _that_ was it,\" whispered Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"No, that wasn't it,\" retorted Rokens; \"that was a hinn, a white-painted\r\nhinn, as stood by the roadside, and right glad wos I to see it, I can\r\ntell ye, shipmates, for I wos gittin' tired as well as frightened.  I\r\nsoon roused the landlord by kickin' at the door till it nearly comed off\r\nits hinges; and arter gettin' another glass o' grog, I axed the landlord\r\nto show me my bunk, as I wanted to turn in.\r\n\r\n\"It was a queer old house that hinn wos.  A great ramblin' place, with\r\nno end o' staircases and passages.  A dreadful gloomy sort o' place.  No\r\none lived in it except the landlord, a dark-faced surly fellow as one\r\nwould like to kick out of his own door, and his wife, who wos little\r\nbetter than his-self.  They also had a hostler, but he slept with the\r\ncattle in a hout-house.\r\n\r\n\"`Ye won't be fear'd,' says the landlord, as he hove ahead through the\r\nlong passages holdin' the candle high above his head to show the way,\r\n`to sleep in the far end o' the house.  It's the old bit; the new bit's\r\nundergoin' repairs.  You'll find it comfortable enough, though it's\r\nraither gusty, bein' old, ye see; but the weather ain't cold, so ye\r\nwon't mind it.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! niver a bit,' says I, quite bold like; `I don't care a rap for\r\nnothin'.  There ain't no ghosts, is there?'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, I'm not sure; many travellers wot has stayed here has said to me\r\nthey've seed 'em, particklerly in the old part o' the buildin', but they\r\nseems to be quite harmless, and never hurts any one as lets 'em alone.\r\nI never seed 'em myself, an' there's cer'nly not more nor half-a-dozen\r\non 'em--hallo!--'\r\n\r\n\"At that moment, shipmates, a strong gust o' cold air came rushin' down\r\nthe passage we was in, and blow'd out the candle.  `Ah! it's gone out,'\r\nsaid the landlord; `just wait here a moment, and I'll light it;' and\r\nwith that he shuffled off, and left me in the blackest and most thickest\r\ndarkness I ever wos in in all my life.  I didn't dare to move, for I\r\ndidn't know the channels, d'ye see, and might ha' run myself aground or\r\nagainst the rocks in no time.  The wind came moanin' down the passage;\r\nas if all the six ghosts the landlord mentioned, and a dozen or two o'\r\ntheir friends besides, was a-dyin' of stommick-complaint.  I'm not easy\r\nfrightened, lads, but my knees did feel as if the bones in 'em had\r\nturned to water, and my hair began to git up on end, for I felt it\r\nrisin'.  Suddenly I saw somethin' comin' along the passage towards me--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the ghost, _now_,\" interrupted Gurney, in a tremulous whisper.\r\n\r\nRokens paused, and regarded his fat shipmate with a look of contemptuous\r\npity; then turning to the others, he said--\r\n\r\n\"It wos _the landlord_, a-comin' back with the candle.  He begged pardon\r\nfor leavin' me in the dark so long, and led the way to a room at the far\r\nend o' the passage.  It was a big, old-fashioned room, with a\r\ntreemendius high ceiling, and no furniture, 'cept one chair, one small\r\ntable, and a low camp-bed in a corner.  `Here's your room,' says the\r\nlandlord; `it's well-aired.  I may as well mention that the latch of the\r\ndoor ain't just the thing.  It sometimes blows open with a bang, but\r\nwhen you know it may happen, you can be on the look-out for it, you\r\nknow, and so you'll not be taken by surprise.  Good-night.'  With that\r\nthe fellow set the candle down on the small table at the bedside, and\r\nleft me to my cogitations.  I heerd his footsteps echoin' as he went\r\nclankin' along the passages; then they died away, an' I was alone.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I tell ye wot it is, shipmates; I've bin in miny a fix, but I\r\nniver wos in sich a fix as that.  The room was empty and big; so big\r\nthat the candle could only light up about a quarter of it, leavin' the\r\nrest in gloom.  There was one or two old picturs on the walls; one on\r\n'em a portrait of a old admiral, with a blue coat and brass buttons and\r\nwhite veskit.  It hung just opposite the fut o' my bunk, an' I could\r\nhardly make it out, but I saw that the admiral kep his eye on me\r\nwheriver I turned or moved about the room, an' twice or thrice, if not\r\nmore, I saw him wink with his weather eye.  Yes, he winked as plain as I\r\ndo myself.  Says I to myself, says I, `Tim Rokens, you're a British tar,\r\nan' a whaler, an' a harpooner; so, Tim, my boy, don't you go for to be a\r\nbabby.'\r\n\r\n\"With that I smoked a pipe, and took off my clo's, and tumbled in, and\r\nfeeling a little bolder by this time, I blew out the candle.  In gittin'\r\ninto bed I knocked over the snuffers, w'ich fell with an awful clatter,\r\nand my heart lep' into my mouth as I lep' under the blankets, and\r\nkivered up my head.  Howsever, I was uncommon tired, so before my head\r\nwas well on the pillow, I went off to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"How long I slep' I can't go for to say, but w'en I wakened it wos\r\npitch-dark.  I could only just make out the winder by the pale starlight\r\nthat shone through it, but the moment I set my two eyes on it, wot does\r\nI see?  I seed a sight that made the hair on my head stand on end, and\r\nmy flesh creep up like a muffin.  It was a--\"\r\n\r\n\"A ghost!\" whispered Gurney, while his eyes almost started out of his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBefore Tim Rokens could reply, something fell with a heavy flop from the\r\nyard over their heads right in among the men, and vanished with a\r\nshriek.  It was Jacko, who, in his nocturnal rambles in the rigging, had\r\nbeen shaken off the yard on which he was perched, by a sudden lurch of\r\nthe vessel as the tide began to move her about.  At any time such an\r\nevent would have been startling, but at such a time as this it was\r\nhorrifying.  The men recoiled with sharp cries of terror, and then burst\r\ninto laughter as they observed what it was that had fallen amongst them.\r\nBut the laughter was subdued, and by no means hearty.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be the death o' that brute yet,\" said Gurney, wiping the\r\nperspiration from his forehead; \"but go on, Rokens; what was it you\r\nsaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _was_ the ghost,\" replied Rokens, as the men gathered round him\r\nagain--\"a long, thin ghost, standin' at my bedside.  The light was so\r\ndim that I couldn't well make it out, but I saw that it was white, or\r\npale-like, and that it had on a pointed cap, like the cap o' an old\r\nwitch.  I thought I should ha' died outright, and I lay for full five\r\nminits tremblin' like a leaf and starin' full in its face.  At last I\r\nstarted up in despair, not knowin' well wot to do; and the moment I did\r\nso the ghost disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I thought this was very odd, but you may be sure I didn't find fault\r\nwith it; so after lookin' all round very careful to make quite sure that\r\nit was gone, I lay down again on my back.  Well, would ye b'lieve it,\r\nshipmates, at that same moment up starts the ghost again as bold as\r\niver?  And up starts I in a fright; but the moment I was up the ghost\r\nwas gone.  `Now, Tim Rokens,' says I to myself, always keepin' my eye on\r\nthe spot where I'd last seed the ghost, `this _is_ queer; this is quite\r\nremarkable.  You're dreamin', my lad, an' the sooner ye put a stop to\r\nthat 'ere sort o' dreamin' the better.'\r\n\r\n\"Havin' said this, I tried to feel reckless, and lay down again, and up\r\nstarted the ghost again with its long thin white body, an' the pointed\r\ncap on its head.  I noticed, too, that it wore its cap a little on one\r\nside quite jaunty like.  So, wheniver I sot up that 'ere ghost\r\ndisappeared, and wheniver I lay down it bolted up again close beside me.\r\nAt last I lost my temper, and I shouts out quite loud, `Shiver my\r\ntimbers,' says I, `ghost or no ghost, I'll knock in your daylights if ye\r\ncarry on like that any longer;' and with that I up fist and let drive\r\nstraight out at the spot where its bread-basket should ha' bin.  Down it\r\nwent, that ghost did, with a clatter that made the old room echo like an\r\nempty church.  I guv it a rap, I did, sich as it hadn't had since it was\r\nborn--if ghosts be born at all--an' my knuckles paid for it, too, for\r\nthey was skinned all up; then I lay down tremblin', and then, I dun know\r\nhow it was, I went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Next mornin' I got up to look for the ghost, and, sure enough, I found\r\nhis _remains_!  His pale body lay in a far corner o' the room doubled up\r\nand smashed to bits, and his pointed cap lay in another corner almost\r\nflat.  That ghost,\" concluded Rokens, with slow emphasis--\"that ghost\r\nwas the _candle_, it wos!\"\r\n\r\n\"The candle!\" exclaimed several of the men in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the candle, and brass candlestick with the stinguisher a-top o't.\r\nYe see, lads, the candle stood close to the side o' my bed on the table,\r\nan' when I woke up and I saw it there, it seemed to me like a big thing\r\nin the middle o' the room, instead o' a little thing close to my nose;\r\nan' when I sot up in my bed, of coorse I looked right over the top of it\r\nand saw nothin'; an' when I lay down, of coorse it rose up in the very\r\nsame place.  An', let me tell you, shipmates,\" added Tim, in conclusion,\r\nwith the air of a philosopher, \"_all_ ghosts is o' the same sort.\r\nThey're most of 'em made o' wood or brass, or some sich stuff, as I've\r\ngood cause to remimber, for I had to pay the price o' that 'ere ghost\r\nbefore I left that there hinn on the lonesome moor, and for the washin'\r\nof the blankets, too, as wos all kivered with blood nixt mornin' from my\r\nsmashed knuckles.  There's a morial contained in most things, lads, if\r\nye only try for to find it out; an' the morial of my story is this--\r\ndon't ye go for to b'lieve that everything ye don't 'xactly understand\r\nis a ghost until ye've got to know more about it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Tim Rokens was thus recounting his ghostly experiences, and\r\nmoralising thereon, for the benefit of his comrades, the silent tide was\r\nstealthily creeping up the sides of the _Red Eric_, and placing her\r\ngradually on an even keel.  At the same time a British man-of-war was\r\ncreeping down upon that innocent vessel with the murderous intention of\r\nblowing her out of the water, if possible.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain this latter fact, we must remind the reader of the\r\nboat and crew of the Portuguese slaver which was encountered by the\r\nparty of excursionists on their trip down the river.  The vessel to\r\nwhich that boat belonged had been for several weeks previous creeping\r\nabout off the coast, watching her opportunity to ship a cargo of slaves,\r\nand at the same time to avoid falling into the hands of a British\r\ncruiser which was stationed on the African coast to prevent the\r\nvillainous traffic.  The Portuguese ship, which was very similar in size\r\nand shape to the _Red Eric_, had hitherto managed to elude the cruiser,\r\nand had succeeded in taking a number of slaves on board ere she was\r\ndiscovered.  The cruiser gave chase to her on the same afternoon as that\r\non which the _Red Eric_ grounded on the mud-bank off the mouth of the\r\nriver.  Darkness, however, favoured the slaver, and when the land breeze\r\nfailed, she was lost sight of in the intricacies of the navigation at\r\nthat part of the coast.\r\n\r\nTowards morning, while it was yet dark, the _Red Eric_ floated, and\r\nCaptain Dunning, who had paced the deck all night with a somewhat\r\nimpatient tread, called to the mate--\"Now, Mr Millons, man the boats,\r\nand let some of the hands stand-by to trim the sails to the first puff\r\nof wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the mate, as he sprang to obey.\r\n\r\nNow it is a curious fact, that at that identical moment the captain of\r\nthe cruiser addressed his first lieutenant in precisely the same words,\r\nfor he had caught a glimpse of the whaler's topmasts against the dark\r\nsky, and mistook them, very naturally, for those of the slaver.  In a\r\nfew seconds the man-of-war was in full pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Dr Hopley,\" remarked Captain Dunning, as he gazed intently into\r\nthe gloom astern, \"did you not hear voices? and, as I live, there's a\r\nlarge ship bearing right down on us!\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a slaver,\" replied the doctor; \"probably the one that owned\r\nthe boat we saw up the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship on the larboard bow!\" shouted the look-out on the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! ships ahead and astern!\" remarked the captain, in surprise.\r\n\"There seems to be a `school' of 'em in these waters.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the oars of the boats belonging to the ship astern were\r\nheard distinctly, and a light puff of wind at the same time bulged out\r\nthe sails of the _Red Eric_, which instantly forged ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!\" shouted a voice from the boats astern in a tone of\r\nauthority; \"heave-to, you rascal, or I'll sink you!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning turned to the doctor with a look of intense surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, doctor, that's the usual hail of a pirate, or something like it.\r\nWhat it can be doing here is past my comprehension.  I would as soon\r\nexpect to find a whale in a wash-tub as a black flag in these waters!\r\nPort, port a little\" (turning to the steersman)--\"steady--so.  We must\r\nrun for it, anyhow, for we're in no fightin' trim.  The best answer to\r\ngive to such a hail is silence.\"\r\n\r\nContrary to expectation the boats did not again hail, but in a few\r\nminutes the dark hull of the British cruiser became indistinctly visible\r\nas it slipped swiftly through the water before the freshening breeze,\r\nand neared the comparatively slow-going whaler rapidly.  Soon it came\r\nwithin easy range, and while Captain Dunning looked over the taffrail\r\nwith a troubled countenance, trying to make her out, the same voice came\r\nhoarsely down on the night breeze issuing the same peremptory command.\r\n\r\n\"Turn up the hands, Mr Millons, and serve out pistols and cutlasses.\r\nGet the carronades on the forecastle and quarterdeck loaded, Mr\r\nMarkham, and look alive; we must show the enemy a bold front, whoever he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nAs the captain issued these orders, the darkness was for an instant\r\nilluminated by a bright flash; the roar of a cannon reverberated over\r\nthe sea; a round-shot whistled through the rigging of the _Red Eric_,\r\nand the next instant the foretopsail-yard came rattling down upon the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nImmediately after, the cruiser ranged up alongside, and the order to\r\nheave-to was repeated with a threat that was calculated to cause the\r\nhair of a man of peace to stand on end.  The effect on Captain Dunning\r\nwas to induce him to give the order--\r\n\r\n\"Point the guns there, lads, and aim high; I don't like to draw first\r\nblood--even of a pirate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy!  Who are you, and where from?\" inquired Captain Dunning,\r\nthrough the speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"Her British Majesty's frigate _Firebrand_.  If you don't heave-to, sir,\r\ninstantly, I'll give you a broadside.  Who are you, and where bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" whistled Captain Dunning, to vent his feelings of surprise ere\r\nhe replied, \"The _Red Eric_, South Sea whaler, outward bound.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given this piece of information, he ordered the topsails to be\r\nbacked, and the ship was hove-to.  Meanwhile a boat was lowered from the\r\ncruiser, and the captain thereof speedily leaped upon the whaler's\r\nquarterdeck.\r\n\r\nThe explanation that followed was not by any means calculated to allay\r\nthe irritation of the British captain.  He had made quite sure that the\r\n_Red Eric_ was the slaver of which he was in search, and the discovery\r\nof his mistake induced him to make several rather severe remarks in\r\nreference to the crew of the _Red Eric_ generally and her commander in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you heave-to when I ordered you,\" he said, \"and so save all\r\nthis trouble and worry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied Captain Dunning drily, \"I'm not in the habit of\r\nobeying orders until I know that he who gives 'em has a right to do so.\r\nBut 'tis a pity to waste time talking about such trifles when the craft\r\nyou are in search of is not very far away at this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, sir?\" inquired the captain of the cruiser quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that yonder vessel, scarcely visible now on the lee bow, is the\r\nslaver, in all likelihood.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain gave but one hasty glance in the direction pointed to by\r\nCaptain Dunning, and next moment he was over the side of the ship, and\r\nthe boat was flying swiftly towards his vessel.  The rapid orders given\r\non board the cruiser soon after, showed that her commander was eagerly\r\nin pursuit of the strange vessel ahead, and the flash and report of a\r\ncouple of guns proved that he was again giving orders in his somewhat\r\nperemptory style.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight appeared, Captain Dunning was still on deck, and Glynn\r\nProctor stood by the wheel.  The post of the latter, however, was a\r\nsinecure, as the wind had again fallen.  When the sun rose it revealed\r\nthe three vessels lying becalmed within a short distance of each other\r\nand several miles off shore.\r\n\r\n\"So, so,\" exclaimed the captain, taking the glass and examining the\r\nother vessels.  \"I see it's all up with the slaver.  Serves him right;\r\ndon't it, Glynn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does,\" replied Glynn emphatically.  \"I hope they will all be hanged.\r\nIsn't that the usual way of serving these fellows out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not exactly, lad.  They don't go quite that length--more's the\r\npity; if they did, there would be less slave-trading; but the rascals\r\nwill lose both ship and cargo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Glynn, \"how they can afford to carry on the trade when\r\nthey lose so many ships as I am told they do every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't wonder, boy, if you knew the enormous prices got for\r\nslaves.  Why, the profits on one cargo, safely delivered, will more than\r\ncover the loss of several vessels and cargoes.  You may depend on't they\r\nwould not carry it on if it did not pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Glynn, giving the wheel a savage turn, as if to\r\nexpress his thorough disapprobation of the slave-trade, and his extreme\r\ndisgust at not being able, by the strength of his own right arm, at once\r\nto repress it.  \"And who's to pay for our foretopsail-yard?\" he\r\ninquired, abruptly, as if desirous of changing the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Ourselves, I fear,\" replied the captain.  \"We must take it\r\nphilosophically, and comfort ourselves with the fact that it _is_ the\r\nforetopsail-yard, and not the bowsprit or the mainmast, that was carried\r\naway.  It's not likely the captain of the cruiser will pay for it, at\r\nany rate.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning was wrong.  That same morning he received a polite note\r\nfrom the commander of the said cruiser, requesting the pleasure of his\r\ncompany to dinner, in the event of the calm continuing, and assuring him\r\nthat the carpenter and the sail-maker of the man-of-war should be sent\r\non board his ship after breakfast to repair damages.  Captain Dunning,\r\ntherefore, like an honest, straightforward man as he was, admitted that\r\nhe had been hasty in his judgment, and stated to Glynn Proctor,\r\nemphatically, that the commander of the _Firebrand_ was \"a trump.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nNEW SCENES--A FIGHT PREVENTED BY A WHALE--A STORM--BLOWN OFF THE\r\nYARDARM--WRECK OF THE \"RED ERIC\".\r\n\r\nFive weeks passed away, and really, when one comes to consider the\r\nmatter, it is surprising what a variety of events may be compressed into\r\nfive weeks; what an amount of space may be passed over, what an immense\r\nchange of scene and circumstance may be experienced in that\r\ncomparatively short period of time.\r\n\r\nMen and women who remain quietly at home do not, perhaps, fully realise\r\nthis fact.  Five weeks to them does not usually seem either very long or\r\nvery short.  But let those quiet ones travel; let them rush away\r\nheadlong, by the aid of wind and steam, to the distant and wonderful\r\nparts of this wonderful world of ours, and, ten to one, they will\r\nafterwards tell you that the most wonderful discovery they had made\r\nduring their travels, is the fact that a miniature lifetime (apparently)\r\ncan be compressed into five weeks.\r\n\r\nFive weeks passed away, and in the course of that time the\r\nforetopsail-yard of the _Red Eric_ had been repaired; the _Red Eric_\r\nherself had passed from equatorial into southern seas; Alice Dunning had\r\nbecome very sea-sick, which caused her to look uncommonly green in the\r\nface, and had got well again, which caused her to become fresh and rosy\r\nas the early morning; Jacko had thoroughly established his reputation as\r\nthe most arrant and accomplished thief that ever went to sea: King\r\nBumble had been maligned and abused again and again, and over again,\r\ndespite his protestations of innocence, by grim-faced Tarquin, the\r\nsteward, for having done the deeds which were afterwards discovered to\r\nhave been committed by Jacko; fat little Gurney had sung innumerable\r\nsongs of his own composing, in which he was ably supported by Glynn\r\nProctor; Dr Hopley had examined, phrenologically, all the heads on\r\nboard, with the exception of that of Tarquin, who would not submit to\r\nthe operation on any account, and had shot, and skinned, and stuffed a\r\nvariety of curious sea-birds, and caught a number of remarkable\r\nsea-fish, and had microscopically examined--to the immense interest of\r\nAilie, and consequently of the captain--a great many surprising\r\nanimalcules, called _Medusae_, which possessed the most watery and the\r\nthinnest possible bodies, yet which had the power of emitting a\r\nbeautiful phosphoric light at night, so as to cause the whole ocean\r\nsometimes to glow as if with liquid fire; Phil Briant had cracked more\r\njokes, good, bad, and indifferent, than would serve to fill a whole\r\nvolume of closely-printed pages, and had told more stories than would be\r\nbelieved by most people; Tim Rokens and the other harpooners had, with\r\nthe assistance of the various boats' crews, slain and captured several\r\nlarge whales, and Nikel Sling had prepared, and assisted to consume, as\r\nmany breakfasts, dinners, and suppers as there are days in the period of\r\ntime above referred to;--in short, those five weeks, which we thus\r\ndismiss in five minutes, might, if enlarged upon, be expanded into\r\nmaterial to fill five volumes such as this, which would probably take\r\nabout five years to write--another reason for cutting this matter short.\r\nAll this shows how much may be compressed into little space, how much\r\nmay be done and seen in little time, and, therefore, how much value men\r\nought to attach to little things.\r\n\r\nFive weeks passed away, as we have already remarked, and at the end of\r\nthat time the _Red Eric_ found herself, one beautiful sunny afternoon,\r\nbecalmed on the breast of the wide ocean with a strange vessel, also a\r\nwhaler, a few miles distant from her, and a couple of sperm-whales\r\nsporting playfully about midway between the two ships.  Jim Scroggles on\r\nthat particular afternoon found himself in the crow's-nest at the\r\nmasthead, roaring \"Thar she blows!\" with a degree of energy so appalling\r\nthat one was almost tempted to believe that that long-legged individual\r\nhad made up his mind to compress his life into one grand but brief\r\nminute, and totally exhaust his powers of soul and body in the\r\nreiterated vociferation of that one faculty of the sperm-whale.\r\nAllowance must be made for Jim, seeing that this was the first time he\r\nhad been fortunate enough to \"raise the oil\" since he became a whaler.\r\n\r\nThe usual scene of bustle and excitement immediately ensued.  The men\r\nsprang to their appointed places in a moment; the tubs, harpoons,\r\netcetera, were got ready, and in a few minutes the three boats were\r\nleaping over the smooth swell towards the fish.\r\n\r\nWhile this was taking place on board the _Red Eric_, a precisely similar\r\nscene occurred on board the other whale-ship, and a race now ensued\r\nbetween the boats of the two ships, for each knew well that the first\r\nboat that harpooned either of the whales claimed it.\r\n\r\n\"Give way, my lads,\" whispered Captain Dunning eagerly, as he watched\r\nthe other boats; \"we shall be first--we shall be first; only bend your\r\nbacks.\"\r\n\r\nThe men needed not to be urged; they were quite as anxious as their\r\ncommander to win the races and bent their backs, as he expressed it,\r\nuntil the oars seemed about to break.  Glynn sat on the after thwart,\r\nand did good service on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the affair would be decided by the boats of\r\nthe two captains, both of which took the lead of the others, but as they\r\nwere advancing in opposite directions it was difficult to tell which was\r\nthe fleeter of the two.  When the excitement of the race was at its\r\nheight the whales went down, and the men lay on their oars to wait until\r\nthey should rise again.  They lay in anxious suspense for about a\r\nminute, when the crew of Captain Dunning's boat was startled by the\r\nsudden apparition of a waterspout close to them, by which they were\r\ncompletely drenched.  It was immediately followed by the appearance of\r\nthe huge blunt head of one of the whales, which rose like an enormous\r\nrock out of the sea close to the starboard-quarter.\r\n\r\nThe sight was received with a loud shout, and Tim Rokens leaped up and\r\ngrasped a harpoon, but the whale sheered off.  A spare harpoon lay on\r\nthe stern-sheets close to Glynn, who dropped his oar and seized it.\r\nAlmost without knowing what he was about, he hurled it with tremendous\r\nforce at the monster's neck, into which it penetrated deeply.  The\r\nharpoon fortunately happened to be attached to a large buoy, called by\r\nwhalers a drogue, which was jerked out of the boat like a cannon-shot as\r\nthe whale went down, carrying harpoon and drogue along with it.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, lad,\" cried the captain, in great delight, \"you've made a\r\nnoble beginning!  Now, lads, pull gently ahead, she won't go far with\r\nsuch an ornament as that dangling at her neck.  A capital dart! couldn't\r\nhave done it half so well myself, even in my young days!\"\r\n\r\nGlynn felt somewhat elated at this unexpected piece of success; to do\r\nhim justice, however, he took it modestly.  In a few minutes the whale\r\nrose, but it had changed its course while under water, and now appeared\r\nclose to the leading boat of the other ship.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the whale-fishery, no boat of one vessel has a right to\r\ntouch a whale that has been struck by the boat of another vessel, so\r\nlong as the harpoon holds fast and the rope remains unbroken, or so long\r\nas the float to which the harpoon is connected remains attached.\r\nNevertheless, in defiance of this well-known law, the boat belonging to\r\nthe captain of the strange ship gave chase, and succeeded in making fast\r\nto the whale.\r\n\r\nTo describe the indignation of Captain Dunning and his men on witnessing\r\nthis act is impossible.  The former roared rather than shouted, \"Give\r\nway, lads!\" and the latter bent their backs as if they meant to pull the\r\nboat bodily out of the water, and up into the atmosphere.  Meanwhile all\r\nthe other boats were in hot pursuit of the second whale, which had led\r\nthem a considerable distance away from the first.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by striking that fish?\" shouted Captain Dunning, when,\r\nafter a hard pull, he came up with the boat, the crew of which had just\r\nsucceeded in thrusting a lance deep into a mortal part of the huge\r\nanimal, which soon after rolled over, and lay extended on the waves.\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to ask?\" replied the captain of the strange ship,\r\nan ill-favoured, powerful man, whose countenance was sufficient to\r\ncondemn him in any society, save that of ruffians.  \"Don't you see your\r\ndrogue has broke loose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing of the sort.  It's fast at this moment; so you'll be good\r\nenough to cut loose and take yourself off as fast as you please.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the other made no reply, but, turning to his men, said: \"Make\r\nfast there, lads; signal the other boats, and pull away for the ship;\r\nlook sharp, you lubbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! captain dear,\" muttered Phil Briant, baring both arms up to the\r\nshoulders, \"only give the word; _do_, now!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning, who was already boiling with rage, needed no\r\nencouragement to make an immediate attack on the stranger, neither did\r\nhis men require an order; they plunged their oars into the water, ran\r\nright into the other boat, sprang to their feet, seized lances,\r\nharpoons, and knives, and in another moment would have been engaged in a\r\ndeadly struggle had not an unforeseen event occurred to prevent the\r\nfray.  This was the partial recovery of the whale, which, apparently\r\nresolved to make one final struggle for life, turned over and over,\r\nlashed the sea into foam, and churned it up with the blood which spouted\r\nin thick streams from its numerous wounds.\r\n\r\nBoth boats were in imminent danger, and the men sprang to their oars in\r\norder to pull out of the range of the monster's dying struggles.  In\r\nthis effort the strange boat was successful, but that of Captain Dunning\r\nfared ill.  A heavy blow from the whale's tail broke it in two, and\r\nhurled it into the air, whence the crew descended, amid a mass of\r\nharpoons, lances, oars, and cordage, into the blood-stained water.\r\n\r\nThe fish sheered away for some distance, dragging the other boat along\r\nwith it, and then rolled over quite dead.  Fortunately not one of the\r\ncrew of the capsized boat was hurt.  All of them succeeded in reaching\r\nand clinging to the shattered hull of their boat; but there they were\r\ndestined to remain a considerable time, as the boat of the stranger,\r\nhaving secured the dead fish, proceeded leisurely to tow it towards\r\ntheir ship, without paying the slightest attention to the shouts of\r\ntheir late enemies.\r\n\r\nA change had now come over the face of the sky.  Clouds began to gather\r\non the horizon, and a few light puffs of air swept over the sea, which\r\nenabled the strange vessel to bear down on her boat, and take the whale\r\nin tow.  It also enabled the _Red Eric_ to beat up, but more slowly,\r\ntowards the spot where their disabled boat lay, and rescue their\r\ncomrades from their awkward position.  It was some time before the boats\r\nwere all gathered together.  When this was accomplished the night had\r\nset in and the stranger had made off with her ill-gotten prize, the\r\nother whale having sounded, and the chase being abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"Now, of all the disgustin' things that ever happened to me, this is the\r\nworst,\" remarked Captain Dunning, in a very sulky tone of voice, as he\r\ndescended to the cabin to change his garments, Ailie having preceded him\r\nin order to lay out dry clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my darling papa, what a fright I got,\" she exclaimed, running up\r\nand hugging him, wet as he was, for the seventh time, despite his\r\nefforts to keep her off.  \"I was looking through the spy-glass at the\r\ntime it happened, and when I saw you all thrown into the air I cried--\r\noh!  I can't tell you how I cried.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to tell me, Ailie, my pet, for your red, swelled-up eyes\r\nspeak for themselves.  But go, you puss, and change your own frock.\r\nYou've made it as wet as my coat, nearly; besides, I can't undress, you\r\nknow, while you stand there.\"\r\n\r\nAilie said, \"I'm so very, very thankful,\" and then giving her father one\r\nconcluding hug, which completely saturated the frock, went to her own\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the crew of the captain's boat were busy in the forecastle\r\nstripping off their wet garments, and relating their adventures to the\r\nmen of the other boats, who, until they reached the ship, had been\r\nutterly ignorant of what had passed.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that Tim Rokens should open the conversation with much the\r\nsame sentiment, if not exactly the same phrase, as that expressed by the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Now boys,\" said he, slapping his wet limbs, \"I'll tell ye wot it is, of\r\nall the aggrawations as has happened to me in my life, this is out o'\r\nsight the wust.  To think o' losin' that there whale, the very biggest I\r\never saw--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Rokens, man,\" interrupted Glynn, as he pulled off his jacket, \"the\r\nloss is greater to me than to you, for that was my _first_ whale!\"\r\n\r\n\"True, boy,\" replied the harpooner, in a tone of evidently genuine\r\nsympathy; \"I feel for ye.  I knows how I should ha' taken on if it had\r\nhappened to me.  But cheer up, lad; you know the old proverb, `There's\r\nas good fish in the sea as ever came out o't.'  You'll be the death o'\r\nmany sich yet, I'll bet my best iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, the wust of it all is, that we don't know who was the big thief\r\nas got that fish away with him,\" said Phil Briant, with a rueful\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't we, though!\" cried Gurney, who had been in the mate's boat; \"I\r\naxed one o' the men o' the stranger's boats--for we run up close\r\nalongside durin' the chase--and he told me as how she was the\r\n_Termagant_ of New York; so we can be down on 'em yet, if we live long\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" observed Rokens; \"and d'ye suppose he'd give ye the right\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd no reason to do otherwise.  He didn't know of the dispute between\r\nthe other boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's truth in that,\" remarked Glynn, as he prepared to go on deck;\r\n\"but it may be a year or more before we foregather.  No, I give up all\r\nclaim to my first fish from this date.\"\r\n\r\n\"All hands ahoy!\" shouted the mate; \"tumble up there!  Reef topsails!\r\nLook alive!\"\r\n\r\nThe men ran hastily on deck, completing their buttoning and belting as\r\nthey went, and found that something very like a storm was brewing.  As\r\nyet the breeze was moderate, and the sea not very high, but the night\r\nwas pitchy dark, and a hot oppressive atmosphere boded no improvement in\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\n\"Lay out there, some of you, and close reef the topsails,\" cried the\r\nmate, as the men ran to their several posts.\r\n\r\nThe ship was running at the time under a comparatively small amount of\r\ncanvas; for, as their object was merely to cruise about in those seas in\r\nsearch of whales, and they had no particular course to steer, it was\r\nusual to run at night under easy sail, and sometimes to lay-to.  It was\r\nfortunate that such was the case on the present occasion; for it\r\nhappened that the storm which was about to burst on them came with\r\nappalling suddenness and fury.  The wind tore up the sea as if it had\r\nbeen a mass of white feathers, and scattered it high in air.  The\r\nmizzen-topsail was blown to ribbons, and it seemed as if the other sails\r\nwere about to share the same fate.  The ship flew from billow to billow,\r\nafter recovering from the first rude shock, as if she were but a dark\r\ncloud on the sea, and the spray flew high over her masts, drenching the\r\nmen on the topsail-yards while they laboured to reef the sails.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to take down these t'gallant-masts, Mr Millons,\" said\r\nthe captain, as he stood by the weather-bulwarks holding on to a\r\nbelaying-pin to prevent his being washed away.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I give the order, sir?\" inquired the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"You may,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\nJust as the mate turned to obey, a shriek was heard high above the\r\nwhistling of the fierce wind.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" said the captain anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied the mate.  \"I fear--I trust--\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the sentence was either suppressed, or the howling of\r\nthe wind prevented its being heard.\r\n\r\nJust then a flash of lightning lit up the scene, and a terrific crash of\r\nthunder seemed to rend the sky.  The flash was momentary, but it served\r\nto reveal the men on the yards distinctly.  They had succeeded in\r\nclose-reefing the topsails, and were hurrying down the rigging.\r\n\r\nThe mate came close to the captain's side and said, \"Did you see, sir,\r\nthe way them men on the mainyard were scramblin' down?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain had not time to reply ere a shout, \"Man overboard!\" was\r\nheard faintly in the midst of the storm, and in another instant some of\r\nthe men rushed aft with frantic haste, shouting that one of their number\r\nhad been blown off the yard into the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Down your helm,\" roared the captain; \"stand-by to lower away the\r\nboats.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual prompt \"Ay, ay, sir,\" was given, but before the men could\r\nreach their places a heavy sea struck the vessel amidships, poured\r\nseveral tons of water on the decks, and washed all the loose gear\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\n\"Let her away,\" cried the captain quickly.\r\n\r\nThe steersman obeyed; the ship fell off, and again bounded on her mad\r\ncourse like a wild horse set free.\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use, sir,\" said the mate, as the captain leaped towards the\r\nwheel, which the other had already gained; \"no boat could live in that\r\nsea for a moment.  The poor fellow's gone by this time.  He must be more\r\nthan half-a-mile astern already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" returned the captain, in a deep sad voice.  \"Get these\r\nmasts down, Mr Millons, and see that everything is made fast.  Who is\r\nit, did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"The men can't tell, sir; one of 'em told me 'e thinks it was young\r\nBoswell.  It was too dark to see 'is face, but 'is figure was that of a\r\nstout young fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"A stout young fellow,\" muttered the captain, as the mate hurried\r\nforward.  \"Can it have been Glynn?\"  His heart sank within him at the\r\nthought, and he would have given worlds at that moment, had he possessed\r\nthem, to have heard the voice of our hero, whom, almost unwittingly, he\r\nhad begun to love with all the affection of a father.  While he stood\r\ngazing up at the rigging, attempting to pierce the thick darkness, he\r\nfelt his sleeve plucked, and, looking down, observed Ailie at his side.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" he cried, grasping her by the arm convulsively, \"_you_ here!\r\nHow came you to leave your cabin, dear?  Go down, go down; you don't\r\nknow the danger you run.  Stay--I will help you.  If one of those seas\r\ncomes on board it would carry you overboard like a fleck of foam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know there was much danger, papa.  Glynn told me there\r\nwasn't,\" she replied, as her father sprang with her to the\r\ncompanion-ladder.\r\n\r\n\"How? when? where, child?  Did Glynn speak to you within the last ten\r\nminutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he looked down the hatch just as I was coming up, and told me not\r\nto be afraid, and said I must go below, and not think of coming on deck;\r\nbut I heard a shriek, papa, and feared something had happened, so I came\r\nto ask what it was.  I hope no one is hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"My darling Ailie,\" replied the captain, in an agitated voice, \"go down\r\nto your berth, and pray for us just now.  There is not _much_ danger;\r\nbut in all times of danger, whether great or slight, we should pray to\r\nOur Father in Heaven, for we never know what a day or an hour may bring\r\nforth.  I will speak to you about everything to-morrow; to-night I must\r\nbe on deck.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her forehead, pushed her gently into the cabin, shut the door,\r\nand, coming on deck, fastened the companion-hatch firmly down.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the ship was prepared to face the worst.  The topsails\r\nwere close-reefed; the topgallant-masts sent down on deck; the spanker\r\nand jib were furled, and, soon after, the mainsail and foresail were\r\nalso furled.  The boats were taken in and secured on deck, and the ship\r\nwent a little more easily through the raging sea; but as the violence of\r\nthe gale increased, sail had to be further reduced, and at\r\nlast everything was taken in except the main spencer and\r\nforetopmast-staysail.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind this much,\" said the captain, as he and the first mate\r\nstood close to the binnacle, \"if I only knew our exact position.  But\r\nwe've not had an observation for several days, and I don't feel sure of\r\nour whereabouts.  There are some nasty coral reefs in these seas.  Did\r\nyou find out who the poor fellow is yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's young Boswell, I fear, Mr Markham is mustering the men just now,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the second mate came aft and confirmed their fears.  The\r\nman who had thus been summoned in a moment, without warning, into the\r\npresence of his Maker, had been a quiet, modest youth, and a favourite\r\nwith every one on board.  At any other time his death would have been\r\ndeeply felt; but in the midst of that terrible storm the men had no time\r\nto think.  Indeed, they could not realise the fact that their shipmate\r\nwas really gone.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Markham,\" said the captain, as the second mate turned away, \"send a\r\nhand in to the chains to heave the lead.  I don't feel at all easy in my\r\nmind, so near these shoals as we must be just now.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the order was being obeyed the storm became fiercer and more\r\nfurious.  Bright gleams of lightning flashed repeatedly across the sky,\r\nlighting up the scene as if with brightest moonlight, and revealing the\r\nhorrid turmoil of the raging sea in which the ship now laboured heavily.\r\nThe rapidity with which the thunder followed the lightning showed how\r\nnear to them was the dangerous and subtle fluid; and the crashing,\r\nbursting reports that shook the ship from stem to stern gave the\r\nimpression that mountains were being dashed to atoms against each other\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nAll the sails still exposed to the fury of the gale were blown to\r\nshreds; the foretopmast and the jib-boom were carried away along with\r\nthem and the _Red Eric_ was driven at last before the wind under bare\r\npoles.  The crew remained firm in the midst of this awful scene; each\r\nman stood at his post, holding on by any fixed object that chanced to be\r\nwithin his reach, and held himself ready to spring to obey every order.\r\nNo voice could be heard in the midst of the howling winds, the lashing\r\nsea, and the rending sky.  Commands were given by signs as well as\r\npossible, during the flashes of lightning; but little or nothing\r\nremained to be done.  Captain Dunning had done all that a man thoroughly\r\nacquainted with his duties could accomplish to put his ship in the best\r\ncondition to do battle with the storm, and he now felt that the issue\r\nremained in the hands of Him who formed the warring elements, and whose\r\nwill alone could check their angry strife.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the vivid flashes of lightning the captain observed Glynn\r\nProctor standing near the starboard gangway, and, waiting for the next\r\nflash, he made a signal to him to come to the spot where he stood.\r\nGlynn understood it, and in a few seconds was at his commander's side.\r\n\r\n\"Glynn,\" my boy, said the latter, \"you won't be wanted on deck for some\r\ntime.  There's little to be done now.  Go down and see what Ailie's\r\nabout, poor thing.  She'll need a little comfort.  Say I sent you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout other reply than a nod of the head, Glynn sprang to the\r\ncompanion-hatch, followed by the captain, who undid the fastenings to\r\nlet him down and refastened them immediately, for the sea was washing\r\nover the stern continually.\r\n\r\nGlynn found the child on her knees in the cabin with her face buried in\r\nthe cushions of one of the sofas.  He sat down beside her and waited\r\nuntil she should have finished her prayer; but as she did not move for\r\nsome time he laid his hand gently on her shoulder.  She looked up with a\r\nhappy smile on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Glynn, is that you?  I'm so glad,\" she said, rising, and sitting\r\ndown beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Your father sent me down to comfort you, my pet,\" said Glynn, taking\r\nher hand in his and drawing her towards him.\r\n\r\n\"I have got comfort already,\" replied the child; \"I'm so very happy,\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Ailie? who has been with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"God has been with me.  You told me, Glynn, that there wasn't much\r\ndanger, but I felt sure that there was.  Oh!  I never heard such\r\nterrible noises, and this dreadful tossing is worse than ever I felt\r\nit--a great deal.  So I went down on my knees and prayed that God, for\r\nChrist's sake would save us.  I felt very frightened, Glynn.  You can't\r\nthink how my heart beat every time the thunder burst over us.  But\r\nsuddenly--I don't know how it was--the words I used to read at home so\r\noften with my dear aunts came into my mind; you know them, Glynn, `Call\r\nupon Me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt\r\nglorify Me.'  I don't know where I read them.  I forget the place in the\r\nBible now; but when I thought of them I felt much less frightened.  Do\r\nyou think it was the Holy Spirit who put them into my mind?  My aunts\r\nused to tell me that all my _good_ thoughts were given to me by the Holy\r\nSpirit.  Then I remembered the words of Jesus, `I will never leave thee\r\nnor forsake thee,' and I felt so happy after that.  It was just before\r\nyou came down.  I _think_ we shall not be lost.  God would not make me\r\nfeel so happy if we were going to be lost, would He?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not, Ailie,\" replied Glynn, whose conscience reproached him for\r\nhis ignorance of the passages in God's word referred to by his\r\ncompanion, and who felt that he was receiving rather than administering\r\ncomfort.  \"When I came down I did not very well know how I should\r\ncomfort you, for this is certainly the most tremendous gale I ever saw,\r\nbut somehow I feel as if we were in less danger now.  I wish I knew more\r\nof the Bible, Ailie.  I'm ashamed to say I seldom look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's a pity, isn't it, Glynn?\" said Ailie, with earnest concern\r\nexpressed in her countenance, for she regarded her companion's ignorance\r\nas a great misfortune; it never occurred to her that it was a sin.  \"But\r\nit's very easy to learn it,\" she added with an eager look.  \"If you come\r\nto me here every day we can read it together.  I would like to have you\r\nhear me say it off, and then I would hear you.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could reply the vessel received a tremendous shock which\r\ncaused her to quiver from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n\"She must have been struck by lightning,\" cried Glynn, starting up and\r\nhurrying towards the door.  Ailie's frightened look returned for a few\r\nminutes, but she did not tremble as she had done before.\r\n\r\nJust as Glynn reached the top of the ladder the hatch was opened and the\r\ncaptain thrust in his head.\r\n\r\n\"Glynn, my boy,\" said he, in a quick, firm tone, \"we are ashore.\r\nPerhaps we shall go to pieces in a few minutes.  God knows.  May He in\r\nHis mercy spare us.  You cannot do much on deck.  Ailie must be looked\r\nafter till I come down for her.  Glynn, _I depend upon you_.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered hurriedly, and the hatch was shut immediately\r\nafter.  It is impossible to describe accurately the conflicting feelings\r\nthat agitated the breast of the young sailor as he descended again to\r\nthe cabin.  He felt gratified at the trust placed in him by the captain,\r\nand his love for the little girl would at any time have made the post of\r\nprotector to her an agreeable one; but the idea that the ship had struck\r\nthe rocks, and that his shipmates on deck were struggling perhaps for\r\ntheir lives while he was sitting idly in the cabin, was most trying and\r\ndistressing to one of his ardent and energetic temperament.  He was not,\r\nhowever, kept long in suspense.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he regained the cabin when the ship again struck with\r\nterrific violence, and he knew by the rending crash overhead that one or\r\nmore of the masts had gone over the side.  The ship at the same moment\r\nslewed round and was thrown on her beam-ends.  So quickly did this occur\r\nthat Glynn had barely time to seize Ailie in his arms and save her from\r\nbeing dashed against the bulkhead.\r\n\r\nThe vessel rose again on the next wave, and was hurled on the rocks with\r\nsuch violence that every one on board expected her to go to pieces\r\nimmediately.  At the same time the cabin windows were dashed in, and the\r\ncabin itself was flooded with water.  Glynn was washed twice across the\r\ncabin and thrown violently against the ship's sides, but he succeeded in\r\nkeeping a firm hold of his little charge and in protecting her from\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Glynn!\" shouted the captain, as he opened the companion-hatch,\r\n\"come on deck, quick! bring her with you!\"\r\n\r\nGlynn hurried up and placed the child in her father's arms.\r\n\r\nThe scene that presented itself to him on gaining the deck was indeed\r\nappalling.  The first grey streak of dawn faintly lighted up the sky,\r\njust affording sufficient light to exhibit the complete wreck of\r\neverything on deck, and the black froth-capped tumult of the surrounding\r\nbillows.  The rocks on which they had struck could not be discerned in\r\nthe gloom, but the white breakers ahead showed too clearly where they\r\nwere.  The three masts had gone over the side one after another, leaving\r\nonly the stumps of each standing.  Everything above board--boats,\r\nbinnacle, and part of the bulwarks--had been washed away.  The crew were\r\nclinging to the belaying-pins and to such parts of the wreck as seemed\r\nlikely to hold together longest.  It seemed to poor Ailie, as she clung\r\nto her father's neck that she had been transported to some far-distant\r\nand dreadful scene, for scarcely a single familiar object remained by\r\nwhich her ocean home, the _Red Eric_, could be recognised.\r\n\r\nBut Ailie had neither desire nor opportunity to remark on this\r\ntremendous change.  Every successive billow raised the doomed vessel,\r\nand let her fall with heavy violence on the rocks.  Her stout frame\r\ntrembled under each shock, as if she were endued with life, and shrank\r\naffrighted from her impending fate; and it was as much as the captain\r\ncould do to maintain his hold of the weather-bulwarks and of Ailie at\r\nthe same time.  Indeed, he could not have done it at all had not Glynn\r\nstood by and assisted him to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\n\"It won't last long, lad,\" said the captain, as a larger wave than usual\r\nlifted the shattered hull and dashed it down on the rocks, washing the\r\ndeck from stern to stem, and for a few seconds burying the whole crew\r\nunder water.  \"May the Almighty have mercy on us; no ship can stand this\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the tide is falling,\" suggested Glynn, in an encouraging voice,\r\n\"and I think I see something like a shore ahead.  It will be daylight in\r\nhalf-an-hour or less.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head.  \"There's little or no tide here to rise or\r\nfall, I fear.  Before half-an-hour we shall--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, but looking at Ailie with a gaze of\r\nagony, he pressed her more closely to his breast.\r\n\r\n\"I think we shall be saved,\" whispered the child, twining her arms more\r\nclosely round her father's neck, and laying her wet cheek against his.\r\n\r\nJust then Tim Rokens crept aft, and said that he saw a low sandy island\r\nahead, and a rocky point jutting out from it close to the bows of the\r\nship.  He suggested that a rope might be got ashore when it became a\r\nlittle lighter.\r\n\r\nPhil Briant came aft to make the same suggestion, not knowing that\r\nRokens had preceded him.  In fact, the men had been consulting as to the\r\npossibility of accomplishing this object, but when they looked at the\r\nfearful breakers that boiled in white foam between the ship's bow and\r\nthe rocky point, their hearts failed them, and no one was found to\r\nvolunteer for the dangerous service.\r\n\r\n\"Is any one inclined to try it?\" inquired the captain.  \"There's niver a\r\nwan of us but 'ud try it, cap'en, _if you gives the order_,\" answered\r\nBriant.\r\n\r\nThe captain hesitated.  He felt disinclined to order any man to expose\r\nhimself to such imminent danger; yet the safety of the whole crew might\r\ndepend on a rope being connected with the shore.  Before he could make\r\nup his mind, Glynn, who saw what was passing in his mind,\r\nexclaimed--\"I'll do it, captain;\" and instantly quitting his position,\r\nhurried forward as fast as circumstances would permit.\r\n\r\nThe task which Glynn had undertaken to perform turned out to be more\r\ndangerous and difficult than at first he had anticipated.  When he stood\r\nat the lee bow, fastening a small cord round his waist, and looking at\r\nthe turmoil of water into which he was about to plunge, his heart\r\nwell-nigh failed him, and he felt a sensation of regret that he had\r\nundertaken what seemed now an impossibility.  He did not wonder that the\r\nmen had one and all shrunk from the attempt.  But he had made up his\r\nmind to do it.  Moreover, he had _said_ he would do it, and feeling that\r\nhe imperilled his life in a good cause, he set his face as a flint to\r\nthe accomplishment of his purpose.\r\n\r\nWell was it for Glynn Proctor that day that in early boyhood he had\r\nlearned to swim, and had become so expert in the water as to be able to\r\nbeat all his young companions!\r\n\r\nHe noticed, on looking narrowly at the foaming surge through which he\r\nmust pass in order to gain the rocky point, that many of the submerged\r\nrocks showed their tops above the flood, like black spots, when each\r\nwave retired.  To escape these seemed impossible--to strike one of them\r\nhe knew would be almost certain death.\r\n\r\n\"Don't try it, boy,\" said several of the men, as they saw Glynn hesitate\r\nwhen about to spring, and turn an anxious gaze in all directions; \"it's\r\ninto death ye'll jump, if ye do.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn did not reply; indeed, he did not hear the remark, for at that\r\nmoment his whole attention was riveted on a ledge of submerged rock,\r\nwhich ever and anon showed itself, like the edge of a knife, extending\r\nbetween the ship and the point.  Along the edge of this the retiring\r\nwaves broke in such a manner as to form what appeared to be dead\r\nwater-tossed, indeed, and foam-clad, but not apparently in progressive\r\nmotion.  Glynn made up his mind in an instant, and just as the first\r\nmate came forward with an order from the captain that he was on no\r\naccount to make the rash attempt, he sprang with his utmost force off\r\nthe ship's side and sank in the raging sea.\r\n\r\nWords cannot describe the intense feeling of suspense with which the men\r\non the lee bow gazed at the noble-hearted boy as he rose and buffeted\r\nwith the angry billows.  Every man held his breath, and those who had\r\ncharge of the line stood nervously ready to haul him back at a moment's\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nOn first rising to the surface he beat the waves as if bewildered, and\r\nwhile some of the men cried, \"He's struck a rock,\" others shouted to\r\nhaul him in; but in another second he got his eyes cleared of spray, and\r\nseeing the ship's hull towering above his head, he turned his back on it\r\nand made for the shore.  At first he went rapidly through the surge, for\r\nhis arm was strong and his young heart was brave; but a receding wave\r\ncaught him and hurled him some distance out of his course--tossing him\r\nover and over as if he had been a cork.  Again he recovered himself, and\r\ngaining the water beside the ledge, he made several powerful and rapid\r\nstrokes, which carried him within a few yards of the point.\r\n\r\n\"He's safe,\" said Rokens eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No; he's missed it!\" cried the second mate, who, with Gurney and Dick\r\nBarnes, payed out the rope.\r\n\r\nGlynn had indeed almost caught hold of the farthest-out ledge of the\r\npoint when he was drawn back into the surge, and this time dashed\r\nagainst a rock and partially stunned.  The men had already begun to haul\r\nin on the rope when he recovered, and making a last effort, gained the\r\nrocks, up which he clambered slowly.  When beyond the reach of the waves\r\nhe fell down as if he had fainted.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the case; he was merely exhausted, as well as\r\nconfused, by the blows he had received on the rocks, and lay for a few\r\nseconds quite still in order to recover strength, during which period of\r\ninaction he thanked God earnestly for his deliverance, and prayed\r\nfervently that he might be made the means of saving his companions in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two he rose, unfastened the line from his waist, and\r\nbegan to haul it ashore.  To the other end of the small line the men in\r\nthe ship attached a thick cable, the end of which was soon pulled up,\r\nand made fast to a large rock.\r\n\r\nTim Rokens was now ordered to proceed to the shore by means of the rope\r\nin order to test it.  After this a sort of swing was constructed, with a\r\nnoose which was passed round the cable.  To this a small line was\r\nfastened, and passed to the shore.  On this swinging-seat Ailie was\r\nseated, and hauled to the rocks, Tim Rokens \"shinning\" along the cable\r\nat the same time to guard her from accident.  Then the men began to\r\nland, and thus, one by one, the crew of the _Red Eric_ reached the shore\r\nin safety; and when all had landed, Captain Dunning, standing in the\r\nmidst of his men, lifted up his voice in thanksgiving to God for their\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nBut when daylight came the full extent of their forlorn situation was\r\nrevealed.  The ship was a complete wreck; the boats were all gone, and\r\nthey found that the island on which they had been cast was only a few\r\nsquare yards in extent--a mere sandbank, utterly destitute of shrub or\r\ntree, and raised only a few feet above the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SANDBANK--THE WRECKED CREW MAKE THE BEST OF BAD CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely surprise the reader to be told that, after the first\r\nemotions of thankfulness for deliverance from what had appeared to the\r\nshipwrecked mariners to be inevitable death, a feeling amounting almost\r\nto despair took possession of the whole party for a time.\r\n\r\nThe sandbank was so low that in stormy weather it was almost submerged.\r\nIt was a solitary coral reef in the midst of the boundless sea.  Not a\r\ntree or bush grew upon it, and except at the point where the ship had\r\nstruck, there was scarcely a rock large enough to afford shelter to a\r\nsingle man.  Without provisions, without sufficient shelter, without the\r\nmeans of escape, and _almost_ without the hope of deliverance, it seemed\r\nto them that nothing awaited them but the slow, lingering pains and\r\nhorrors of death by starvation.\r\n\r\nAs those facts forced themselves more and more powerfully home to the\r\napprehension of the crew,--while they cowered for shelter from the storm\r\nunder the lee of the rocky point, they gave expression to their feelings\r\nin different ways.  Some sat down in dogged silence to await their fate;\r\nothers fell on their knees and cried aloud to God for mercy; while a few\r\nkept up their own spirits and those of their companions by affecting a\r\ncheerfulness which, however, in some cages, was a little forced.  Ailie\r\nlay shivering in her father's arms, for she was drenched with salt water\r\nand very cold.  Her eyes were closed, and she was very pale from\r\nexposure and exhaustion, but her lips moved as if in prayer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning looked anxiously at Dr Hopley, who crouched beside\r\nthem, and gazed earnestly in the child's face while he felt her pulse.\r\n\r\n\"It's almost too much for her, I fear,\" said the captain, in a\r\nhesitating, husky voice.\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not answer for a minute or two, then he said, as if\r\nmuttering to himself rather than replying to the captain's remark, \"If\r\nwe could only get her into dry clothes, or had a fire, or even a little\r\nbrandy, but--\" He did not finish the sentence, and the captain's heart\r\nsank within him, and his weather-beaten face grew pale as he thought of\r\nthe possibility of losing his darling child.\r\n\r\nGlynn had been watching the doctor with intense eagerness, and with a\r\nterrible feeling of dread fluttering about his heart.  When he heard the\r\nlast remark he leaped up and cried--\"If brandy is all you want you shall\r\nsoon have it.\"  And running down to the edge of the water, he plunged in\r\nand grasped the cable, intending to clamber into the ship, which had by\r\nthis time been driven higher on the rocks, and did not suffer so much\r\nfrom the violence of the breakers.  At the same instant Phil Briant\r\nsprang to his feet, rushed down after him, and before he had got a yard\r\nfrom the shore, seized him by the collar, and dragged him out of the sea\r\nhigh and dry on the land.\r\n\r\nGlynn was so exasperated at this unceremonious and at the moment\r\nunaccountable treatment, that he leaped up, and in the heat of the\r\nmoment prepared to deal the Irishman a blow that would very probably\r\nhave brought the experiences of the \"ring\" to his remembrance; but\r\nBriant effectually checked him by putting both his own hands into his\r\npockets, thrusting forward his face as if to invite the blow, and\r\nexclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"Och! now, hit fair, Glynn, darlint; put it right in betwane me two\r\neyes!\"\r\n\r\nGlynn laughed hysterically, in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"What mean you by stopping me?\" he asked somewhat sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, I mane that I'll go for the grog meself.  Ye've done more nor\r\nyer share o' the work this mornin', an' it's but fair to give a poor\r\nfellow a chance.  More be token, ye mustn't think that nobody can't do\r\nnothin' but yeself.  It's Phil Briant that'll shin up a rope with any\r\nwhite man in the world, or out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Phil,\" said Rokens, who had come to separate the\r\ncombatants.  \"Go aboord, my lad, an' I'll engage to hold this here young\r\nalligator fast till ye come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to hold me, Tim,\" retorted Glynn, with a smile; \"but\r\ndon't be long about it, Phil.  You know where the brandy is kept--look\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nBriant accomplished his mission successfully, and, despite the furious\r\nwaves, brought the brandy on shore in safety.  As he emerged like a\r\ncaricature of old Neptune dripping from the sea, it was observed that he\r\nheld a bundle in his powerful grasp.  It was also strapped to his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what have you got there?\" inquired the doctor, as he staggered\r\nunder the shelter of the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! give a dhrop to the child, an' don't be wastin' yer breath,\"\r\nreplied Briant, as he undid the bundle.  \"Sure I've brought a few\r\ntrifles for her outside as well as her in.\"  And he revealed to the glad\r\nfather a bundle of warm habiliments which he had collected in Ailie's\r\ncabin, and kept dry by wrapping them in several layers of tarpaulin.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my man,\" said the captain, grasping the thoughtful\r\nIrishman by the hand.  \"Now, Ailie, my darling pet, look up, and swallow\r\na drop o' this.  Here's a capital rig-out o' dry clothes too.\"\r\n\r\nA few sips of brandy soon restored the circulation which had well-nigh\r\nbeen arrested, and when she had been clothed in the dry garments, Ailie\r\nfelt comparatively comfortable, and expressed her thanks to Phil Briant\r\nwith tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nA calm often succeeds a storm somewhat suddenly, especially in southern\r\nlatitudes.  Soon after daybreak the wind moderated, and before noon it\r\nceased entirely, though the sea kept breaking in huge rolling billows on\r\nthe sandbank for many hours afterwards.  The sun, too, came out hot and\r\nbrilliant, shedding a warm radiance over the little sea-girt spot as\r\nwell as over the hearts of the crew.\r\n\r\nHuman nature exhibits wonderful and sudden changes.  Men spring from the\r\ndepths of despair to the very summit, of light-hearted hope, and very\r\nfrequently, too, without a very obvious cause to account for the violent\r\nchange.  Before the day after the storm was far advanced, every one on\r\nthe sandbank seemed to be as joyous as though there was no danger of\r\nstarvation whatever.  There was, however, sufficient to produce the\r\nchange in the altered aspect of affairs.  For one thing, the warm sun\r\nbegan to make them feel comfortable--and really it is wonderful how\r\nready men are to shut their eyes to the actual state of existing things\r\nif they can only enjoy a little present comfort.  Then the ship was\r\ndriven so high up on the rocks as to be almost beyond the reach of the\r\nwaves, and she had not been dashed to pieces, as had at first been\r\ndeemed inevitable, so that the stores and provisions in her might be\r\nsecured, and the party be thus enabled to subsist on their ocean prison\r\nuntil set free by some passing ship.\r\n\r\nUnder the happy influence of these improved circumstances every one went\r\nabout the work of rendering their island home more comfortable, in good,\r\nalmost in gleeful spirits.  Phil Briant indulged in jests which a few\r\nhours ago would have been deemed profane, and Gurney actually\r\nvolunteered the song of the \"man wot got his nose froze;\" but every one\r\ndeclined to listen to it, on the plea that it reminded them too forcibly\r\nof the cold of the early morning.  Even the saturnine steward, Tarquin,\r\nlooked less ferocious than usual, and King Bumble became so loquacious\r\nthat he was ordered more than once to hold his tongue and to \"shut up.\"\r\n\r\nThe work they had to do was indeed of no light nature.  They had to\r\ntravel to and fro between the ship and the rocks on the rope-cable, a\r\nsomewhat laborious achievement, in order to bring ashore such things as\r\nthey absolutely required.  A quantity of biscuit, tea, coffee, and sugar\r\nwere landed without receiving much damage, then a line was fastened to a\r\ncask of salt beef, and this, with a few more provisions, was drawn\r\nashore the first day, and placed under the shelter of the largest rock\r\non the point.  On the following day it was resolved that a raft should\r\nbe constructed, and everything that could in any way prove useful be\r\nbrought to the sandbank and secured.  For Captain Dunning well knew that\r\nanother storm might arise as quickly as the former had done, and\r\nalthough the ship at present lay in comparatively quiet water, the huge\r\nbillows that would be dashed against her in such circumstances would be\r\ncertain to break her up and scatter her cargo on the breast of the\r\nall-devouring sea.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this activity and bustle there sat one useless and\r\nsilent, but exceedingly grave and uncommonly attentive spectator,\r\nnamely, Jacko the monkey.  That sly and sagacious individual, seeing\r\nthat no one intended to look after him, had during the whole of the\r\nrecent storm wisely looked after himself.  He had ensconced himself in a\r\nsnug and comparatively sheltered corner under the afterpart of the\r\nweather-bulwarks.  But when he saw the men one by one leaving the ship,\r\nand proceeding to the shore by means of the rope, he began to evince an\r\nanxiety as to his own fate which had in it something absolutely human.\r\nJacko was the last man, so to speak, to leave the _Red Eric_.  Captain\r\nDunning, resolving, with the true spirit of a brave commander; to\r\nreserve that honour to himself, had seen the last man, he thought, out\r\nof the ship, and was two-thirds of the distance along the rope on his\r\nway to land, when Jim Scroggles, who was _always_ either in or out of\r\nthe way at the most inopportune moments, came rushing up from below,\r\nwhither he had gone to secure a favourite brass _finger-ring_, and\r\nscrambled over the side.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say whether Jim's head, or feet, or legs, or\r\nknees, or arms went over the side first,--they all got over somehow,\r\nnobody knew how--and in the getting over his hat flew off and was lost\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, and feeling, no doubt, the momentous truth of that\r\nwell-known adage \"Now or never,\" Master Jacko uttered a shriek, bounded\r\nfrom his position of fancied security, and seized Jim Scroggles firmly\r\nby the hair, resolved apparently to live or perish along with him.  As\r\nto simply clambering along that cable to the shore.  Jacko would have\r\nthought no more of it than of eating his dinner.  Had he felt so\r\ndisposed he could have walked along it, or hopped along it, or thrown\r\nsomersaults along it.  But to proceed along it while it was at one\r\nmoment thirty feet above the sea, rigid as a bar of iron, and the next\r\nmoment several feet under the mad turmoil of the raging billows--this it\r\nwas that filled his little bosom with inexpressible horror, and induced\r\nhim to cling with a tight embrace to the hair of the head of his\r\nbitterest enemy!\r\n\r\nHaving gained the shore, Jacko immediately took up his abode in the\r\nwarmest spot on that desolate sandbank, which was the centre of the mass\r\nof cowering and shivering men who sought shelter under the lee of the\r\nrocks, where he was all but squeezed to death, but where he felt\r\ncomparatively warm, nevertheless.  When the sun came out he perched\r\nhimself in a warm nook of the rock near to Ailie, and dried himself,\r\nafter which, as we have already hinted, he superintended the discharging\r\nof the cargo and the arrangements made for a prolonged residence on the\r\nsandbank.\r\n\r\n\"Och! but yer a queer cratur,\" remarked Briant, as he passed, chucking\r\nthe monkey under the chin.\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo-ee-o!\" replied Jacko.\r\n\r\n\"Very thrue, no doubt--but I haven't time to spake to ye jist yet, lad,\"\r\nreplied Briant, with a laugh, as he ran down to the beach and seized a\r\nbarrel which had just been hauled to the water's edge.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with the wood, papa?\" asked Ailie.\r\n\r\nThe captain had seized an axe at the moment, and began vigorously to cut\r\nup a rough plank which had been driven ashore by the waves.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make a fire, my pet, to warm your cold toes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my toes are not cold, papa; you've no idea how comfortable I am.\"\r\n\r\nAilie did indeed look comfortable at that moment, for she was lying on a\r\nbed of dry sand, with a thick blanket spread over her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it will do to warm Jacko's toes, if yours don't want it;\r\nand besides, we all want a cup of tea after our exertions.  The first\r\nstep towards that end, you know, is to make a fire.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the captain piled up dry wood in front of the place where\r\nAilie lay, and in a short time had a capital fire blazing, and a large\r\ntin kettle full of fresh water boiling thereon.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to remark here that the water had been brought in a\r\nsmall keg from the ship, for not a single drop of fresh water was found\r\non the sandbank after the most careful search.  Fortunately, however,\r\nthe water-tanks of the _Red Eric_ still contained a large supply.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of that evening _a_ sort of shed or tent was\r\nconstructed out of canvas and a few boards placed against the rock.\r\nThis formed a comparatively comfortable shelter, and one end of it was\r\npartitioned off for Ailie's special use.  No one was permitted to pass\r\nthe curtain that hung before the entrance to this little boudoir, except\r\nthe captain, who claimed a right to do what he pleased, and Glynn, who\r\nwas frequently invited to enter in order to assist its fair occupant in\r\nher multifarious arrangements, and Jacko, who could not be kept out by\r\nany means that had yet been hit upon, except by killing him; but as\r\nAilie objected to this, he was suffered to take up his abode there, and,\r\nto do him justice, he behaved very well while domiciled in that place.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how speedily little children, and men too,\r\nsometimes, contrive to forget the unpleasant or the sad, or, it may be,\r\nthe dangerous circumstances in which they may chance to be placed, while\r\nengaged in the minute details incident to their peculiar position.\r\nAilie went about arranging her little nest under the rock with as much\r\nzeal and cheerful interest as if she were \"playing at houses\" in her own\r\nroom at home.  She decided that one corner was peculiarly suited for her\r\nbed, because there was a small rounded rock in it which looked like a\r\npillow; so Glynn was directed to spread the tarpaulin and the blankets\r\nthere.  Another corner exhibited a crevice in the rock, which seemed so\r\nsuitable for a kennel for Jacko that the arrangement was agreed to on\r\nthe spot.  We say agreed to, because Ailie suggested everything to\r\nGlynn, and Glynn always agreed to everything that Ailie suggested, and\r\nstood by with a hammer and nails and a few pieces of plank in his hands\r\nready to fulfil her bidding, no matter what it should be.  So Jacko was\r\nsent for to be introduced to his new abode, but Jacko was not to be\r\nfound, for the very good reason that he had taken possession of the\r\nidentical crevice some time before, and at that moment was enjoying a\r\ncomfortable nap in its inmost recess.  Then Ailie caused Glynn to put up\r\na little shelf just over her head, which he did with considerable\r\ndifficulty, because it turned out that nails could not easily be driven\r\ninto the solid rock.  After that a small cave at the foot of the\r\napartment was cleaned out and Ailie's box placed there.  All this and\r\nsundry other pieces of work were executed by the young sailor and his\r\nlittle friend with an amount of cheerful pleasantry that showed they\r\nhad, in the engrossing interest of their pursuit, totally forgotten the\r\nfact that they were cast away on a sandbank on which were neither food\r\nnor water, nor wood, except what was to be found in the wrecked ship,\r\nand around which for thousands of miles rolled the great billows of the\r\nrestless sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nLIFE ON THE SANDBANK--AILIE TAKES POSSESSION OF FAIRYLAND--GLYNN AND\r\nBUMBLE ASTONISH THE LITTLE FISHES.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may form a just conception of the sandbank on\r\nwhich the crew of the _Red Eric_ had been wrecked, we shall describe it\r\nsomewhat carefully.\r\n\r\nIt lay in the Southern Ocean, a little to the west of the longitude of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and somewhere between 2000 and 3000 miles to the\r\nsouth of it.  As has been already remarked, the bank at its highest\r\npoint was little more than a few feet above the level of the ocean, the\r\nwaves of which in stormy weather almost, and the spray of which\r\naltogether, swept over it.  In length it was barely fifty yards, and in\r\nbreadth about forty.  Being part of a coral reef, the surface of it was\r\ncomposed of the beautiful white sand that is formed from coral by the\r\ndashing waves.  At one end of the bank--that on which the ship had\r\nstruck--the reef rose into a ridge of rock, which stood a few feet\r\nhigher than the level of the sand, and stretched out into the sea about\r\ntwenty yards, with its points projecting here and there above water.  On\r\nthe centre of the bank at its highest point one or two very small blades\r\nof green substance were afterwards discovered.  So few were they,\r\nhowever, and so delicate, that we feel justified in describing the spot\r\nas being utterly destitute of verdure.  Ailie counted those green blades\r\nmany a time after they were discovered.  There were exactly thirty-five\r\nof them; twenty-six were, comparatively speaking, large; seven were of\r\nmedium size, and two were extremely small--so small and thin that Ailie\r\nwondered they did not die of sheer delicacy of constitution on such a\r\nbarren spot.  The greater part of the surface of the bank was covered\r\nwith the fine sand already referred to, but there were one or two spots\r\nwhich were covered with variously-sized pebbles, and an immense number\r\nof beautiful small shells.\r\n\r\nOn such a small and barren spot one would think there was little or\r\nnothing to admire.  But this was not the case.  Those persons whose\r\nthoughts are seldom allowed to fix attentively on any subject, are apt\r\nto fall into the mistake of supposing that in this world there are a\r\ngreat many absolutely uninteresting things.  Many things are, indeed,\r\nuninteresting to individuals, but there does not exist a single thing\r\nwhich has not a certain amount of interest to one or another cast of\r\nmind, and which will not afford food for contemplation, and matter\r\nfitted to call forth our admiration for its great and good Creator.\r\n\r\nWe know a valley so beautiful that it has been for generations past, and\r\nwill probably be for generations to come, the annual resort of hundreds\r\nof admiring travellers.  The valley cannot be seen until you are almost\r\nin it.  The country immediately around it is no way remarkable; it is\r\neven tame.  Many people would exclaim at first sight in reference to it,\r\n\"How uninteresting.\"\r\n\r\nIt requires a close view, a minute inspection, to discover the beauties\r\nthat lie hidden there.\r\n\r\nSo was it with our sandbank.  Ailie's first thoughts were, \"Oh! how\r\ndreary; how desolate!\" and in some respects she was right; but she dwelt\r\nthere long enough to discover things that charmed her eye and her\r\nimagination, and caused her sometimes to feel as if she had been\r\ntransported to the realms of Fairyland.\r\n\r\nWe do not say, observe, that the crew of the _Red Eric_ were ever\r\nblessed with such dreams.  Jim Scroggles, for instance, had no eye for\r\nthe minute beauties or wonders of creation.  Jim, according to his own\r\nassertion, could see about as far through a millstone as most men.  He\r\ncould apostrophise his eye, on certain occasions, and tell it--as though\r\nits own power of vision were an insufficient medium of information--that\r\n\"that _wos_ a stunnin' iceberg;\" or that \"that _wos_ a gale and a half,\r\nfit to tear the masts out o' the ship a'most.\"  But for any less\r\nmajestic object in nature, Jim Scroggles had nothing to say either to\r\nhis eye, or his nose, or his shipmates.\r\n\r\nAs was Jim Scroggles, so were most of the other men.  Hence they\r\ngrumbled a good deal at their luckless condition.  But upon the whole\r\nthey were pretty cheerful--especially at meal-times--and, considering\r\ntheir circumstances, they behaved very well.\r\n\r\nGlynn Proctor was a notable exception to the prevailing rule of\r\nindifference to small things.  By nature he was of a superior stamp of\r\nmind to his comrades; besides, he had been better educated; and more\r\nthan all, he was at that time under the influence of Ailie Dunning.  She\r\nadmired what she admired; he liked what she liked; he looked with\r\ninterest at the things which she examined.  Had Ailie sat down beside\r\nthe stock of an old anchor and looked attentively at it, Glynn would\r\nhave sat down and stared at it too, in the firm belief that there was\r\nsomething there worth looking at!  Glynn laughed aloud sometimes at\r\nhimself, to think how deeply interested he had become in the child, for\r\nup to that time he had rather avoided than courted the society of\r\nchildren; and he used to say to Ailie that the sailors would begin to\r\ncall her his little sweetheart, if he spent so much of his time with\r\nher; to which Ailie would reply by asking what a sweetheart was; whereat\r\nGlynn would laugh immoderately; whereupon Ailie would tell him not to be\r\nstupid, but to come and play with her!\r\n\r\nAll the sailors, even including the taciturn Tarquin, had a tender\r\nfeeling of regard for the little girl who shared their fortunes at that\r\ntime, but with the exception of Glynn, none were capable of sympathising\r\nwith her in her pursuits.  Tim Rokens, her father, and Dr Hopley did to\r\nsome extent, but these three had their minds too deeply filled with\r\nanxiety about their critical position to pay her much attention, beyond\r\nthe kindest concern for her physical wants.  King Bumble, too, we beg\r\nhis pardon, showed considerable interest in her.  The sable assistant of\r\nNikel Sling shone conspicuous at this trying time, for his activity,\r\ngood-humour, and endurance, and in connection with Phil Briant, Gurney,\r\nand Jacko, kept up the spirits of the shipwrecked men wonderfully.\r\n\r\nClose under the rocks, on the side farthest removed from the spot where\r\nthe rude tent was pitched, there was a little bay or creek, not more\r\nthan twenty yards in diameter, which Ailie appropriated and called\r\nFairyland!  It was an uncommonly small spot, but it was exceedingly\r\nbeautiful and interesting.  The rocks, although small, were so broken\r\nand fantastically formed, that when Ailie crept close in amongst them,\r\nand so placed herself that the view of the sandbank was entirely shut\r\nout, and nothing was to be seen but little pools of crystal water and\r\nrocklets, with their margin of dazzling white sand, and the wreck of the\r\nship in the distance, with the deep blue sea beyond, she quite forgot\r\nwhere she actually was, and began to wander in the most enchanting\r\ndaydreams.  But when, as often happened, there came towering thick\r\nmasses of snowy clouds, like mountain peaks and battlements in the\r\nbright blue sky, her delight was so great that she could find no words\r\nto express it.\r\n\r\nAt such times--sometimes with Glynn by her side, sometimes alone--she\r\nwould sit in a sunny nook, or in a shady nook if she felt too warm, and\r\ninvite innumerable hosts of fairies to come and conduct her through\r\ninterminable tracts of pure-white cloud region, and order such\r\nunheard-of wild creatures (each usually wanting a tail, or a leg, or an\r\near) to come out of the dark caves, that had they been all collected in\r\none garden for exhibition to the public, that zoological garden would\r\nhave been deemed, out of sight, the greatest of all the wonders of the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nWhen a little wearied with those aerial journeys she would return to\r\n\"Fairyland,\" and, leaning over the brinks of the pools, peer down into\r\ntheir beautiful depths for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nAilie's property of Fairyland had gardens, too, of the richest possible\r\nkind, full of flowers of the most lovely and brilliant hues.  But the\r\nflowers were scentless, and, alas! she could not pluck them, for those\r\ngardens were all under water; they grew at the bottom of the sea!\r\n\r\nYes, reader, if the land was barren on that ocean islet, the pools there\r\nmade up for it by presenting to view the most luxuriant marine\r\nvegetation.  There were forests of branching coral of varied hues; there\r\nwere masses of fan-shaped sponges; there were groves of green and red\r\nsea-weeds; and beds of red, and white, and orange, and striped creatures\r\nthat stuck to the rocks, besides little fish with bright coloured backs\r\nthat played there as if they really enjoyed living always under water--\r\nwhich is not easy for us, you know, to realise!  And above all, the\r\nmedium of water between Ailie and these things was so pure and pellucid\r\nwhen no breeze fanned the surface, that it was difficult to believe,\r\nunless you touched it, there was any water there at all.\r\n\r\nWhile Ailie thus spent her time, or at least her leisure time, for she\r\nwas by no means an idler in that busy little isle, the men were actively\r\nengaged each day in transporting provisions from the _Red Eric_ to the\r\nsandbank, and in making them as secure as circumstances would admit of.\r\nFor this purpose a raft had been constructed, and several trips a day\r\nwere made to and from the wreck, so that in the course of a few days a\r\nconsiderable stock of provisions was accumulated on the bank.  This was\r\ncovered with tarpaulin, and heavy casks of salt junk were placed on the\r\ncorners and edges to keep it down.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell ye wot it is, messmates,\" remarked Gurney, one day, as they\r\nsat down round their wood fire to dine in front of their tent, \"we're\r\npurvisioned for six months at least, an' if the weather only keeps fine\r\nI've no objection to remain wotiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Briant, \"ye'll have to remain that time whether ye object\r\nor not.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means, Paddy,\" retorted Gurney; \"I could swum off to sea and be\r\ndrownded if I liked.\"\r\n\r\n\"No ye couldn't, avic,\" said Briant.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" demanded Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause ye haven't the pluck,\" replied Phil.\r\n\r\n\"I'll pluck the nose off yer face,\" said Gurney, in affected anger.\r\n\r\n\"No ye won't,\" cried Phil, \"'cause av ye do I'll spile the soup by\r\nheavin' it all over ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Gurney, with a look of horror, \"listen to him,\r\nmessmates, he calls it `_soup_'--the nasty kettle o' dirty water!  Well,\r\nwell, it's lucky we hain't got nothin' better to compare it with.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I say, lads,\" interposed Jim Scroggles, seriously, \"wot'll we do\r\nif it comes on to blow a gale and blows away all our purvisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, boys,\" cried Dick Barnes, \"that 'ere's the question, as Hamlet\r\nremarked to his grandfather's ghost; wot is to come on us supposin' it\r\ncomes on to blow sich a snorin' gale as'll blow the whole sandbank away,\r\ncarryin' us and our prog overboard along with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot's that there soup made of?\" demanded Tim Rokens.\r\n\r\n\"Salt junk and peas,\" replied Nikel Sling.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  I thought there was somethin' else in it,\" said Tim, carelessly,\r\n\"for it seems to perdooce oncommon bad jokes in them wot eats of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Tim, don't you go for to be sorcostic, but tell us a story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me tell a story?  No, no, lads; there's Glynn Proctor, he's the boy for\r\nyou.  Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's aboard the wreck just now.  The cap'n sent him for charts and\r\nquadrants, and suchlike cooriosities.  Come, Gurney, tell you one if Tim\r\nwon't.  How wos it, now, that you so mistook yer trade as to come for to\r\ngo to sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't very well tell ye,\" answered Gurney, who, having finished\r\ndinner, had lit his pipe, and was now extended at full length on the\r\nsand, leaning on one arm.  \"Ye see, lads, I've had more or less to do\r\nwith the sea, I have, since ever I comed into this remarkable world--not\r\nthat I ever, to my knowledge, knew one less coorous, for I never was up\r\nin the stars; no more, I s'pose, was ever any o' you.  I was born at\r\nsea, d'ye see?  I don't 'xactly know how I comed for to be born there,\r\nbut I wos told that I wos, and if them as told me spoke truth, I s'pose\r\nI wos.  I was washed overboard in gales three times before I comed for\r\nto know myself at all.  When I first came alive, so to speak, to my own\r\ncertain knowledge, I wos a-sitting on the top of a hen-coop aboard an\r\nEast Indiaman, roarin' like a mad bull as had lost his senses; 'cause\r\nwhy? the hens wos puttin' their heads through the bars o' the coops, and\r\npickin' at the calves o' my legs as fierce as if they'd suddenly turned\r\ncannibals, and rather liked it.  From that time I began a life o'\r\nmisery.  My life before that had bin pretty much the same, it seems, but\r\nI didn't know it, so it didn't matter.  D'ye know, lads, when ye don't\r\nknow a thing it's all the same as if it didn't exist, an' so, in coorse,\r\nit don't matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the first mate, who came up at the moment, \"'ave hany o'\r\nyou fellows got a note-book in which we may record that horacular and\r\ntruly valuable hobserwation?\"\r\n\r\nNo one happening to possess a note-book, Gurney was allowed to proceed\r\nwith his account of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Ships has bin my houses all along up to this here date.  I don't\r\nbelieve, lads as ever I wos above two months ashore at a time all the\r\ncoorse of my life, an' mostly not as long as that.  The smell o' tar and\r\nthe taste o' salt water wos the fust things I iver comed across--'xcept\r\nthe Line, I comed across that jist about the time I wos born, so I'm\r\ntold--and the smell o' tar and taste o' salt water's wot I've bin used\r\nto most o' my life, and moreover, wot I likes best.  One old gentleman\r\nas took a fancy to me w'en I wos a boy, said to me, one fine day, w'en I\r\nchanced to be ashore visitin' my mother--says he, `My boy, would ye like\r\nto go with me and live in the country, and be a gardner?'  `Wot,' says\r\nI, `keep a garding, and plant taters, and hoe flowers an' cabidges?'\r\n`Yes,' says he, `at least, somethin' o' that sort.'  `No, thankee,' says\r\nI; `I b'long to the sea, I do; I wouldn't leave that 'ere no more nor I\r\nwould quit my first love if I had one.  I'm a sailor, I am, out and out,\r\nthrough and through--true blue, and no mistake, an' no one need go for\r\nto try to cause me for to forsake my purfession, and live on shore like\r\na turnip'--that's wot I says to that old gen'lemen.  Yes, lads, I've\r\nroamed the wide ocean, as the song says, far an' near.  I've bin\r\ntattooed by the New Zealanders, and I've danced with the Hottentots, and\r\nate puppy dogs with the Chinese, and fished whales in the North Seas,\r\nand run among the ice near the South Pole, and fowt with pirates, and\r\ndone service on boord of men-o'-war and merchantmen, and junks, and\r\nbumboats; but I never,\" concluded Gurney, looking round with a sigh, \"I\r\nnever came for to be located on a sandbank in the middle of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more did any on us,\" added Rokens, \"Moreover, if we're not picked up\r\nsoon by a ship o' some sort, we're not likely to be located here long,\r\nfor we can't live on salt junk for ever; we shall all die o' the\r\nscurvy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was just enough of possible and probable truth in the last remark\r\nto induce a feeling of sadness among the men for a few minutes, but this\r\nwas quickly put to flight by the extraordinary movements of Phil Briant.\r\nThat worthy had left the group round the fire, and had wandered out to\r\nthe extreme end of the rocky point, where he sat down to indulge,\r\npossibly in sad, or mayhap hopeful reflections.  He was observed to\r\nstart suddenly up, and gaze into the sea eagerly for a few seconds; then\r\nhe cut a caper, slapped his thigh, and ran hastily towards the tent.\r\n\r\n\"What now? where away, Phil?\" cried one of the men.\r\n\r\nBriant answered not, but speedily reappeared at the opening of the tent\r\ndoor with a fishing-line and hook.  Hastening to the point of rock, he\r\nopened a small species of shell-fish that he found there, wherewith he\r\nbaited his hook, and then cast it into the sea.  In a few minutes he\r\nfelt a twitch, which caused him to return a remarkably vigorous twitch,\r\nas it were in reply.\r\n\r\nThe fish and the sailor for some minutes acted somewhat the part of\r\nelectricians in a telegraph office; when the fish twitched, Briant\r\ntwitched; when the fish pulled and paused, Briant pulled and paused, and\r\nwhen the fish held on hard, Briant pulled hard, and finally pulled him\r\nashore, and a very nice plump rock-codling he was.  There were plenty of\r\nthem, so in a short time there was no lack of fresh fish, and Rokens'\r\nfear that they would have to live on salt junk was not realised.\r\n\r\nFishing for rock-codlings now became one of the chief recreations of the\r\nmen while not engaged in bringing various necessaries from the wreck.\r\nBut for many days at first they found their hands fully occupied in\r\nmaking their new abode habitable, in enlarging and improving the tent,\r\nwhich soon by degrees came to merit the name of a hut, and in inventing\r\nvarious ingenious contrivances for the improvement of their condition.\r\nIt was not until a couple of weeks had passed that time began to hang\r\nheavy on their hands and fishing became a general amusement.\r\n\r\nThey all fished, except Jacko.  Even Ailie tried it once or twice, but\r\nshe did not like it and soon gave it up.  As for Jacko, he contented\r\nhimself with fishing with his hands, in a sly way, among the provision\r\ncasks, at which occupation he was quite an adept; and many a nice\r\ntit-bit did he fish up and secrete in his private apartment for future\r\nuse.  Like many a human thief, Jacko was at last compelled to leave the\r\ngreater part of his ill-gotten and hoarded gains behind him.\r\n\r\nOne day Glynn and Ailie sat by the margin of a deep pool in Fairyland,\r\ngazing down into its clear depths.  The sun's rays penetrated to the\r\nvery bottom, revealing a thousand beauties in form and colour that\r\ncalled forth from Ailie the most extravagant expressions of admiration.\r\nShe wound up one of those eloquent bursts by saying--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Glynn, how very, _very_ much I do wish I could go down there and\r\nplay with the dear, exquisite, darling little fishes!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd surprise them, I suspect,\" said Glynn.  \"It's rather too deep a\r\npool to play in unless you were a mermaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"How deep is it, Glynn?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bout ten feet, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much?  It does not look like it.  What a very pretty bit of coral I\r\nsee over there, close to the white rock; do you see it?  It is bright\r\npink.  Oh, I would like _so_ much to have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\" cried Glynn, jumping up and throwing off his jacket; \"then\r\nhere goes for it.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying he clasped his hands above his head, and bending forward,\r\nplunged into the pool and went straight at the piece of pink coral,\r\nhead-foremost, like an arrow!\r\n\r\nGlynn was lightly clad.  His costume consisted simply of a pair of white\r\ncanvas trousers and a blue striped shirt, with a silk kerchief round his\r\nneck, so that his movements in the water were little, if at all, impeded\r\nby his clothes.  At the instant he plunged into the water King Bumble\r\nhappened to approach, and while Ailie stood, petrified with fear as she\r\nsaw Glynn struggling violently at the bottom of the pool, her sable\r\ncompanion stood looking down with a grin from ear to ear that displayed\r\nevery one of his white teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be 'fraid, Missie Ally,\" said the negro; \"him's know wot him's\r\ndoin', ho yis!\"\r\n\r\nBefore Ailie could reply, Glynn was on the surface spluttering and\r\nbrushing the hair from his forehead with one hand, while with the other\r\nhe hugged to his breast the piece of pink coral.\r\n\r\n\"Here--it--ha!--is.  My breath--oh--is a'most gone--Ailie--catch hold!\"\r\ncried he, as he held out the coveted piece of rock to the child, and\r\nscrambled out of the pool.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Glynn; but why did you go down so quick and stay so\r\nlong?  I got _such_ a fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bin pay your 'spects to de fishes,\" said Bumble, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have, Bumble, and they say that if you stare at them any longer\r\nwith your great goggle eyes they'll all go mad with horror and die right\r\noff.  Have you caught any codlings, Bumble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, me hab, an' me hab come for to make a preeposol to Missie Ally.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what, Bumble?\"\r\n\r\n\"A preeposol--a digestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you mean a suggestion, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, dat the berry ting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, out with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dis am it.  Me ketch rock-coddles; well, me put 'em in bucket ob water\r\nan' bring 'em to you, Missie Ally, an' you put 'em into dat pool and\r\ntame 'em, an' hab great fun with 'em.  Eeh! wot you tink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will be _so_ nice.  How good of you to think about it, Bumble;\r\ndo get them as quick as you can.\"\r\n\r\nBumble looked grave and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's wrong?\" inquired Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, noting.  Me only tink me not take the trouble to put 'em into dat\r\npool where de fishes speak so imperently ob me.  Stop, me will go an'\r\nask if dey sorry for wot dey hab say.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the negro uttered a shout, sprang straight up into the air,\r\ndoubled his head down and his heels up, and cleft the water like a\r\nknife.  Glynn uttered a cry something between a yell and a laugh, and\r\nsprang after him, falling flat on the water and dashing the whole pool\r\ninto foam, and there the two wallowed about like two porpoises, to the\r\nunbounded delight of Ailie, who stood on the brink laughing until the\r\ntears ran down her cheeks, and to the unutterable horror, no doubt, of\r\nthe little fish.\r\n\r\nThe rock-codlings were soon caught and transferred to the pool, in\r\nwhich, after that, neither Glynn nor Bumble were suffered to dive or\r\nswim, and Ailie succeeded, by means of regularly feeding them, in making\r\nthe little fish less afraid of her than they were at first.\r\n\r\nBut while Ailie and Glynn were thus amusing themselves and trying to\r\nmake the time pass as pleasantly as possible, Captain Dunning was\r\noppressed with the most anxious forebodings.  They had now been several\r\nweeks on the sandbank.  The weather had, during that time, been steadily\r\nfine and calm, and their provisions were still abundant, but he knew\r\nthat this could not last.  Moreover, he found on consulting his charts\r\nthat he was far out of the usual course of ships, and that deliverance\r\ncould only be expected in the shape of a chance vessel.\r\n\r\nOppressed with these thoughts, which, however, he carefully concealed\r\nfrom every one except Tim Rokens and the doctor, the captain used to go\r\non the point of rocks every day and sit there for hours, gazing out\r\nwistfully over the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nMATTERS GROW WORSE AND WORSE--THE MUTINY--COMMENCEMENT OF BOAT-BUILDING,\r\nAND THREATENING STORMS.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, about three weeks after the _Red Eric_ had been wrecked\r\non the sandbank, Captain Dunning went out on the point of rocks, and\r\ntook up his accustomed position there.  Habit had now caused him to go\r\nto the point with as much regularity as a sentinel.  But on the present\r\noccasion anxiety was more deeply marked on his countenance than usual,\r\nfor dark, threatening clouds were seen accumulating on the horizon, an\r\nunnatural stillness prevailed in the hot atmosphere and on the glassy\r\nsea, and everything gave indication of an approaching storm.\r\n\r\nWhile he sat on a low rock, with his elbows on his knees, and his chin\r\nresting in his hands, he felt a light touch on his shoulder, and looking\r\nround, found Ailie standing by his side.  Catching her in his arms, he\r\npressed her fervently to his heart, and for the first time spoke to her\r\nin discouraging tones.\r\n\r\n\"My own darling,\" said he, parting the hair from her forehead, and\r\ngazing at the child with an expression of the deepest sadness, \"I fear\r\nwe shall _never_ quit this dreary spot.\"\r\n\r\nAilie looked timidly in her father's face, for his agitated manner, more\r\nthan his words, alarmed her.\r\n\r\n\"Won't we leave it, dear papa,\" said she, \"to go up yonder?\" and she\r\npointed to a gathering mass of clouds overhead, which, although heavy\r\nwith dark shadows, had still a few bright, sunny points of resemblance\r\nto the fairy realms in which she delighted to wander in her daydreams.\r\n\r\nThe captain made no reply; but, shutting his eyes, and drawing Ailie\r\nclose to his side, he uttered a long and fervent prayer to God for\r\ndeliverance, if He should see fit, or for grace to endure with Christian\r\nresignation and fortitude whatever He pleased to send upon them.\r\n\r\nWhen he concluded, and again looked up, Dr Hopley was standing beside\r\nthem, with his head bowed upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\"I fear, doctor,\" said the captain, \"that I have broken my resolution\r\nnot to alarm my dear Ailie by word or look.  Yet why should I conceal\r\nfrom her the danger of our position?  Her prayers for help ought to\r\nascend, as well as ours, to Him who alone can deliver us from evil at\r\nany time, but who makes us to _feel_, as well as _know_, the fact at\r\nsuch times as these.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not afraid, papa,\" said Ailie quickly.  \"I'm never afraid when\r\nyou are by me; and I've known we were in danger all along, for I've\r\nheard everybody talking about it often and often, and I've _always_\r\nprayed for deliverance, and surely it must come; for has not Jesus said\r\nif we ask anything in His name He will give it to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, darling; but He means only such things as will do us good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, papa, if I asked for a bad thing, I would not expect Him to\r\ngive me that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deliverance from death,\" said the doctor, \"is a good thing, yet we\r\ncannot be sure that God will grant our prayer for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are worse things than death, doctor,\" replied the captain; \"it\r\nmay be sometimes better for men to die than to live.  It seems to me\r\nthat we ought to use the words, `if it please the Lord,' more frequently\r\nthan we do in prayer.  Deliverance from sin needs no such `if,' but\r\ndeliverance from death does.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by Tim Rokens, who came\r\nup to the captain, and said respectfully--\r\n\r\n\"If ye please, sir, it 'ud be as well if ye wos to speak to the men;\r\nthere's somethin' like mutiny a-goin' on, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mutiny! why, what about?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about the spirits.  Some on 'em says as how they wants to enjoy\r\ntheirselves here as much as they can, for they won't have much chance o'\r\ndoin' so ashore any more.  It's my belief that fellow Tarquin's at the\r\nbottom o't.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not much spirits aboard the wreck to fight about,\" said the\r\ncaptain, somewhat bitterly, as they all rose, and hurried towards the\r\nhut.  \"I only brought a supply for medicine; but it must not be touched,\r\nhowever little there is.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the captain came up, he found the space in front of their rude\r\ndwelling a scene of contention and angry dispute that bade fair to end\r\nin a fight.  Tarquin was standing before the first mate, with his knife\r\ndrawn, and using violent language and gesticulations towards him, while\r\nthe latter stood by the raft, grasping a handspike, with which he\r\nthreatened to knock the steward down if he set foot on it.  The men were\r\ngrouped round them, some with looks that implied a desire to side with\r\nTarquin, while others muttered \"Shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shame!\" cried Tarquin, looking fiercely round on his shipmates, \"who\r\ncried shame?  We're pretty sure all on us to be starved to death on this\r\nreef; and it's my opinion, that since we haven't got to live long, we\r\nshould try to enjoy ourselves as much as we can.  There's not much\r\nspirits aboard, more's the pity; but what there is I shall have.  So\r\nagain I say, who cried `Shame?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Glynn Proctor, stepping quickly forward; \"and I invite all\r\nwho think with me to back me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here ye are, me boy,\" said Phil Briant, starting forward, and baring\r\nhis brawny arms, as was his invariable custom in such circumstances.\r\n\"It's meself as'll stick by ye, lad, av the whole crew should go with\r\nthat half-caste crokidile.\"\r\n\r\nGurney and Dick Barnes immediately sided with Glynn also, but Jim\r\nScroggles and Nikel Sling, and, to the surprise of every one, Markham,\r\nthe second mate, sided with the steward.  As the opposing parties\r\nglanced at each other, Glynn observed that, although his side was\r\nsuperior in numbers, some of the largest and most powerful men of the\r\ncrew were among his opponents, and he felt that a conflict between such\r\nmen must inevitably be serious.  Matters had almost come to a crisis\r\nwhen Dr Hopley and the captain approached the scene of action.  The\r\nlatter saw at a glance the state of affairs, and stepping up to the\r\nsteward, ordered him at once into the hut.\r\n\r\nTarquin seemed to waver for a moment under the stern gaze of his\r\ncommander; but he suddenly swore a terrible oath, and said that he would\r\nnot obey.\r\n\r\n\"You're no longer in command of us,\" he said gruffly, \"now that you have\r\nlost your ship.  Every man may do what he pleases.\"\r\n\r\n\"May he?\" replied the captain; \"then it pleases me to do that!\" and,\r\nlaunching out his clenched right hand with all his might, he hit the\r\nsteward therewith right between the eyes.\r\n\r\nTarquin went down as if he had been shot, and lay stunned and at full\r\nlength upon the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my lads,\" cried the captain, turning towards the men, \"what he\r\nsaid just now is so far right.  Having lost my ship, I am no longer\r\nentitled to command you; but my command does not cease unless a majority\r\nof you choose that it should.  Tarquin has taken upon himself to decide\r\nthe question, without asking your opinion, which amounts to mutiny, and\r\nmutiny, under the circumstances in which we are placed, requires to be\r\npromptly dealt with.  I feel it right to say this, because I am a man of\r\npeace, as you well know, and do not approve of a too ready appeal to the\r\nfists for the settlement of a dispute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then, more's the pity!\" interrupted Briant, \"for ye use them\r\noncommon well.\"\r\n\r\nA suppressed laugh followed this remark.\r\n\r\n\"Silence, men, this is no time for jesting.  One of our shipmates has,\r\nnot long since, been taken suddenly from us; it may be that we shall all\r\nof us be called into the presence of our Maker before many days pass\r\nover us.  We have much to do that will require to be done promptly and\r\nwell, if we would hope to be delivered at all, and the question must be\r\ndecided _now_ whether I am to command you, or every one is to do what he\r\npleases.\"\r\n\r\n\"I votes for Cap'en Dunning,\" exclaimed Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"So does I,\" cried Jim Scroggles; who, being somewhat weather-cockish in\r\nhis nature, turned always with wonderful facility to the winning side.\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for the cap'en,\" cried Dick Barnes, suiting the action to\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nAlmost every voice joined in the vociferous cheer with which this\r\nproposal was received.\r\n\r\n\"An' wan more for Miss Ailie,\" shouted Phil Briant.\r\n\r\nEven Jacko lent his voice to the tremendous cheer that followed, for\r\nBriant in his energy chanced to tread on that creature's unfortunate\r\ntail, which always seemed to be in his own way as well as in that of\r\nevery one else, and the shriek that he uttered rang high above the\r\nlaughter into which the cheer degenerated, as some one cried, \"Ah, Pat,\r\ntrust you, my boy, for rememberin' the ladies!\"\r\n\r\nOrder having been thus happily restored, and Captain Dunning having\r\nannounced that the late attempt at mutiny should thenceforth be buried\r\nin total oblivion, a council was called, in order to consider seriously\r\ntheir present circumstances, and to devise, if possible, some means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\"My lads,\" said the captain, when they were all assembled, \"I've been\r\nponderin' over matters ever since we were cast away on this bank, an'\r\nI've at last come to the conclusion that our only chance of gettin' away\r\nis to build a small boat and fit her out for a long voyage.  I need not\r\ntell you that this chance is a poor one--well-nigh a forlorn hope.  Had\r\nit been better I would have spoken before now, and began the work\r\nsooner; but I have lived from day to day in the hope of a ship heaving\r\nin sight.  This is a vain hope.  We are far out of the usual track of\r\nall ships here.  None come this way, except such as may chance to be\r\nblown out of their course, as we were; and even if one did come within\r\nsight, it's ten chances to one that we should fail to attract attention\r\non such a low bank as this.\r\n\r\n\"I've had several reliable observations of late, and I find that we are\r\nupwards of two thousand miles from the nearest known land, which is the\r\nCape of Good Hope.  I propose, therefore, that we should strip off as\r\nmuch of the planking of the wreck as will suit our purpose, get the\r\ncarpenter's chest landed, and commence work at once.  Now, what say you?\r\nIf anyone has a better plan to suggest, I'll be only to glad to adopt\r\nit, for such a voyage in so slim a craft as we can build here will be\r\none necessarily replete with danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell ye wot it is, cap'en,\" said Tim Rokens, rising up, taking off\r\nhis cap, and clearing his throat, as if he were about to make a studied\r\noration.  \"We've not none on us got no suggestions to make wotsomdiver.\r\nYou've only got to give the word and we'll go to work; an' the sooner\r\nyou does so the better, for it's my b'lief we'll have a gale afore long\r\nthat'll pretty well stop work altogether as long as it lasts.\"\r\n\r\nThe indications in the sky gave such ample testimony to the justness of\r\nRokens' observations that no more time was wasted in discussion.  Dick\r\nBarnes, who acted the part of ship's carpenter when not otherwise\r\nengaged, went out to the wreck on the raft, with a party of men under\r\ncommand of Mr Millons, to fetch planking and the necessary material for\r\nthe construction of a boat, while the remainder of the crew, under the\r\ncaptain's superintendence, prepared a place near Fairyland for laying\r\nthe keel.\r\n\r\nThis spot was selected partly on account of the convenient formation of\r\nthe shore for the launching of the boat when finished, and partly\r\nbecause that would be the lee side of the rocky point when the coming\r\nstorm should burst.  For the latter reason the hut was removed to\r\nFairyland, and poor Ailie had the mortification in a few hours of seeing\r\nher little paradise converted into an unsightly wreck of confusion.\r\nAlas! how often this is the case in human affairs of greater moment;\r\nshowing the folly of setting our hearts on the things of earth.  It\r\nseems at first sight a hard passage, that, in the Word of God.  \"What?\"\r\nthe enthusiastic but thoughtless are ready to exclaim, \"not love the\r\nworld! the bright, beautiful world that was made by God to be enjoyed?\r\nNot love our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, wives? not give our\r\nwarmest affections to all these?\"  Truly, ye hasty ones, if you would\r\nbut earnestly consider it, you would find that God not only permits, but\r\nrequires us to love all that is good and beautiful here, as much as we\r\nwill, as much as we can; but we ought to love Himself _more_.  If this\r\nbe our happy condition, then our hearts are not \"set on the world\"; on\r\nthe contrary, they are set free to love the world and all that is\r\nlovable in it--of which there is very, very much--more, probably than\r\nthe best of men suppose.  Else, wherefore does the Father love it and\r\ncare for it so tenderly?\r\n\r\nBut Ailie had not set her heart on her possessions on the sandbank.  She\r\nfelt deep regret for a time, it is true, and in feeling thus she\r\nindulged a right and natural impulse, but that impulse did not lead to\r\nthe sin of murmuring.  Her sorrow soon passed away, and she found\r\nherself as cheerful and happy afterwards in preparing for her long, long\r\nvoyage as ever she had been in watching the gambols of her fish, or in\r\nadmiring the lovely hues of the weeds and coral rocks in the limpid\r\npools of Fairyland.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Dunning set about the\r\npreparations for building the boat that afternoon, for the storm burst\r\nupon them sooner than had been expected, and long before all the\r\nrequisite stores and materials had been rafted from the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe most important things, however, had been procured--such as the\r\ncarpenter's chest, a large quantity of planking, oakum, and cordage, and\r\nseveral pieces of sail cloth, with the requisite thread and needles for\r\nmaking boat sails.  Still, much was wanting when the increasing violence\r\nof the wind compelled them to leave off work.\r\n\r\nSome of the men were now ordered to set about securing such materials as\r\nhad been collected, while others busied themselves in fixing ropes to\r\nthe hut and rolling huge masses of coral rock against its fragile walls\r\nto steady it.\r\n\r\n\"Av ye plaze, sir,\" said Briant to the Captain, wiping his forehead as\r\nhe approached with a lump of tarry canvas which he used in default of a\r\nbetter pocket-handkerchief, \"av ye plaze, sir, wot'll I do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do something useful, lad, whatever you do,\" said the captain, looking\r\nup from the hole which he was busily engaged in digging for the\r\nreception of a post to steady the hut.  \"There's lots of work; you can\r\nplease yourself as to choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I comed fur to suggist that the purvisions and things a-top o' the\r\nsandbank isn't quite so safe as they might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Briant; I was just thinking of that as you came up.  Go and see\r\nyou make a tight job of it.  Get Rokens to help you.\"\r\n\r\nBriant hurried off, and calling his friend, walked with him to the top\r\nof the sandbank, leaning heavily against the gale, and staggering as\r\nthey went.  The blast now whistled so that they could scarcely hear each\r\nother talk.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be blowed right into the sea,\" shouted Tim, as the two reached a\r\npile of casks and cases.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, that's me own belaif entirely,\" roared his companion.\r\n\r\n\"What d'ye say to dig a hole and stick the things in it?\" yelled Rokens.\r\n\r\n\"We're not fit,\" screamed Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Let's try,\" shrieked the other.\r\n\r\nTo this Briant replied by falling on his knees on the lee side of the\r\ngoods, and digging with his hands in the sand most furiously.  Tim\r\nRokens followed his example, and the two worked like a couple of\r\nsea-moles (if such creatures exist) until a hole capable of holding\r\nseveral casks was formed.  Into this they stowed all the biscuit casks\r\nand a few other articles, and covered them up with sand.  The remainder\r\nthey covered with tarpaulin, and threw sand and stones above it until\r\nthe heap was almost buried out of sight.  This accomplished, they\r\nstaggered back to the hut as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nHere they found everything snugly secured, and as the rocks effectually\r\nsheltered the spot from the gale, with the exception of an occasional\r\neddying blast that drove the sand in their faces, they felt\r\ncomparatively comfortable.  Lighting their pipes, they sat down among\r\ntheir comrades to await the termination of the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE STORM.\r\n\r\nA storm in almost all circumstances is a grand and solemnising sight,\r\none that forces man to feel his own weakness and his Maker's might and\r\nmajesty.  But a storm at sea in southern latitudes, where the winds are\r\nlet loose with a degree of violence that is seldom or never experienced\r\nin the temperate zones, is so terrific that no words can be found to\r\nconvey an adequate idea of its appalling ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe storm that at this time burst upon the little sandbank on which the\r\nshipwrecked crew had found shelter, was one of the most furious,\r\nperhaps, that ever swept the seas.  The wind shrieked as if it were\r\nendued with life, tore up the surface of the groaning deep into masses\r\nand shreds of foam, which it whirled aloft in mad fury, and then\r\ndissipated into a thin blinding mist that filled the whole atmosphere,\r\nso that one could scarcely see a couple of yards beyond the spot on\r\nwhich he stood.  The hurricane seemed to have reached its highest point\r\nsoon after sunset that night, and a ray of light from the moon struggled\r\never and anon through the black hurtling clouds, as if to reveal to the\r\ncowering seamen the extreme peril of their situation.  The great ocean\r\nwas lashed into a wide sheet of foam, and the presence of the little\r\nisle in the midst of that swirling waste of water was indicated merely\r\nby a slight circle of foam that seemed whiter than the rest of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe men sat silently in their frail hut, listening to the howling blast\r\nwithout.  A feeling of awe crept over the whole party, and the most\r\ncareless and the lightest of heart among the crew of the _Red Eric_\r\nceased to utter his passing jest, and became deeply solemnised as the\r\nroar of the breakers filled his ear, and reminded him that a thin ledge\r\nof rock alone preserved him from instant destruction.\r\n\r\n\"The wind has shifted a point,\" said the captain, who had just risen and\r\nopened a chink of the rude door of the hut in order to look out.  \"I see\r\nthat the keel of the boat is all fast and the planking beside it.  The\r\ncoral rock shelters it just now; but if the wind goes on shifting I fear\r\nit will stand a poor chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go out and give it a hextra fastening,\" suggested Mr\r\nMillons.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.  There's no use of exposing any of the men to the risk of\r\nbeing blown away.  The wind may keep steady, in which case I've no fear\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dun know,\" said Rokens, who sat beside Ailie, close to the embers of\r\ntheir fire, with a glowing cinder from which he re-lighted his pipe for\r\nat least the twentieth time that night.  \"You never can tell wot's\r\na-goin' to turn up.  I'll go out, cap'en, if ye like, and see that all's\r\nfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you're right, Tim; you may make a bolt across to it, and heave\r\nanother rock or two on the planking if it seems to require it.\"\r\n\r\nThe seaman rose, and putting aside his pipe, threw off his coat, partly\r\nin order that he might present as small a surface to the wind as\r\npossible, and partly that he might have a dry garment to put on when he\r\nreturned.  As he opened the little door of the hut a rude gust of wind\r\nburst in, filling the apartment with spray, and scattering the embers of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much,\" said the captain, as he and the men started up to\r\ngather together the pieces of glowing charcoal; \"that shows the wind's\r\nshifted another point; if it goes round two points more it'll smash our\r\nboat to pieces.  Look sharp, Tim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lean well against the wind, me boy,\" cried Briant, in a warning voice.\r\n\r\nThus admonished, Rokens issued forth, and dashed across the open space\r\nthat separated the hut from the low ledge of coral rock behind which the\r\nkeel of the intended boat and its planking were sheltered.  A very few\r\nminutes sufficed to show Tim that all was fast, and to enable him to\r\nplace a few additional pieces of rock above the heap in order to keep it\r\ndown.  Then he prepared to dart back again to the hut, from the doorway\r\nof which his proceedings, were watched by the captain and as many of the\r\nmen as could crowd round it.\r\n\r\nJust as the harpooner sprang from the shelter of the rock the blast\r\nburst upon the bank with redoubled fury, as if it actually were a\r\nsentient being, and wished to catch the sailor in its rude grasp and\r\nwhirl him away.  Rokens bent his stout frame against it with all his\r\nmight, and stood his ground for a few seconds like a noble tree on some\r\nexposed mountain side that has weathered the gales of centuries.  Then\r\nhe staggered, threw his arms wildly in the air, and a moment after was\r\nswept from the spot and lost to view in the driving spray that flew over\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe thing was so instantaneous that the horrified onlookers could\r\nscarcely credit the evidence of their eyes, and they stood aghast for a\r\nmoment or two ere their feelings found vent in a cry of alarm.  Next\r\ninstant Captain Dunning felt himself rudely pushed aside, and Briant\r\nleaped through the doorway, shouting, as he dashed out--\r\n\r\n\"If Tim Rokens goes, it's Phil Briant as'll go along with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic Irishman was immediately lost to view, and Glynn\r\nProctor was about to follow, when the captain seized him by the collar,\r\ndragged him back, and shut the door violently.\r\n\r\n\"Keep back, lads,\" he cried, \"no one must leave the hut.  If these two\r\nmen cannot save themselves by means of their own strong muscles, no\r\nhuman power can save them.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn, and indeed all of the men, felt this remark to be true, so they\r\nsat down round the fire, and looked in each other's faces with the\r\nexpression of men who half believed they must be dreaming.  Little was\r\nsaid during the next ten or fifteen minutes; indeed, it was difficult to\r\nmake their voices heard, owing to the noise of the wind and dashing\r\nwaves.  The captain stood at the door, looking out from time to time\r\nwith feelings of the deepest anxiety, each moment expecting to see the\r\ntwo sailors struggling back towards the hut; but they did not return.\r\nSoon the gale increased to such a degree that every one felt, although\r\nno one would acknowledge it even to himself, that there was now no hope\r\nof their comrades ever returning.\r\n\r\nThe wind shifted another point; and now their lost shipmates were for a\r\ntime forgotten in the anxieties of their own critical position, for\r\ntheir rocky ledge formed only a partial shelter, and every now and then\r\nthe hut was shaken with a blast so terrible that it threatened to come\r\ndown about their ears.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think our house will fall, dear papa?\" inquired Ailie, as a\r\ngust more furious than any that had hitherto passed swept round the\r\nrocks, and shook the hut as if it had been made of pasteboard.\r\n\r\n\"God knows, my darling; we are in His hands.\"\r\n\r\nAilie tried to comfort herself with the thought that her Heavenly Father\r\nwas indeed the ruler of the storm, and could prevent it from doing them\r\nharm if He pleased; but as gust after gust dashed against the frail\r\nbuilding, and almost shook it down, while the loud rattling of the\r\nboards which composed it almost stunned her, an irresistible feeling of\r\nalarm crept over her, despite her utmost efforts to control herself.\r\n\r\nThe captain now ordered the men to go out and see that the fastenings to\r\nwindward and the supports to leeward of the hut remained firm, and to\r\nadd more of them if possible.  He set the example by throwing off his\r\ncoat and leading the way.\r\n\r\nThis duty was by no means so difficult or dangerous as that which had\r\nbeen previously performed by Rokens, for it must be remembered the hut\r\nas yet was only exposed to partial gusts of eddying wind, not to the\r\nfull violence of the storm.  It involved a thorough wetting, however, to\r\nall who went.  In ten minutes the men re-entered, and put on their dry\r\ncoats, but as no one knew how soon he might again be called upon to\r\nexpose himself, none thought of changing his other garments.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ailie, my pet,\" said Captain Dunning, sitting down beside his\r\nchild on the sandy floor of the hut, \"we've done all we can.  If the\r\nwind remains as it is our house will stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you not seen Rokens or Briant?\" inquired Ailie with an anxious\r\nface, while the tears rolled over her cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head, but made no reply, and the men looked\r\nearnestly at each other, as if each sought to gather a ray of hope from\r\nthe countenance of his friend.  While they sat thus, a terrible blast\r\nshook the hut to its foundation.  Again and again it came with\r\never-increasing violence, and then it burst on them with a continuous\r\nroar like prolonged thunder.\r\n\r\n\"Look out,\" cried the captain, instinctively clasping Ailie in his arms,\r\nwhile the men sprang to their feet.  The stout corner-posts bent over\r\nbefore the immense pressure, and the second mate placed his shoulder\r\nagainst one of those on the windward side of the hut, while Dick Barnes\r\nand Nikel Sling did the same to the other.\r\n\r\n\"It's all up with us,\" cried Tarquin, as part of the roof blew off, and\r\na deluge of water and spray burst in upon them, extinguishing the fire\r\nand leaving them in total darkness.  At that moment Ailie felt herself\r\nseized round the waist by a pair of tiny arms, and putting down her\r\nhand, she felt that Jacko was clinging to her with a tight but trembling\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nEven in that hour of danger, the child experienced a sensation of\r\npleasure at the mere thought that there was one living creature there\r\nwhich looked up to and clung to her for protection; and although she\r\nknew full well that if the stout arm of her father which encircled her\r\nwere removed, her own strength, in their present circumstances, could\r\nnot have availed to protect herself, yet she felt a gush of renewed\r\nstrength and courage at her heart when the poor little monkey put its\r\ntrembling arms around her.\r\n\r\n\"Lay your shoulders to the weather-wall, lads,\" cried the captain, as\r\nanother rush of wind bore down in the devoted hut.\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed, but their united strength availed nothing against the\r\nmighty power that raged without.  The wind, as the captain had feared,\r\nwent round another point, and they were now exposed to the unbroken\r\nforce of the hurricane.  For a few minutes the stout corner-posts of the\r\nhut held up, then they began to rend and crack.\r\n\r\n\"Bear down with the blast to the lee of the rocks, lads,\" cried the\r\ncaptain; \"it's your only chance; don't try to face it.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before the words left his lips the posts snapped with a loud\r\ncrash; the hut was actually lifted off the ground by the wind, and swept\r\ncompletely away, while most of the men were thrown violently to the\r\nground by the wreck as it passed over their heads.  The captain fell\r\nlike the rest, but he retained his grasp of Ailie, and succeeded in\r\nrising, and as the gale carried him away with irresistible fury he bore\r\nfirmly down to his right, and gained the eddy caused by the rocks which\r\nuntil now had sheltered the hut.  He was safe; but he did not feel\r\nsecure until he had staggered towards the most sheltered part, and\r\nplaced his child in a cleft of the rock.\r\n\r\nHere he found Gurney and Tarquin before him, and soon after Glynn came\r\nstaggering in, along with one or two others.  In less than three minutes\r\nafter the hut had been blown away, all the men were collected in the\r\ncleft, where they crouched down to avoid the pelting, pitiless spray\r\nthat dashed over their heads.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive a more desperate position than that in which\r\nthey were now placed, yet there and at that moment a thrill of joy\r\npassed through the hearts of most, if not all of them, for they heard a\r\nshout which was recognised to be the voice of Tim Rokens.  It came from\r\nthe rocks a few yards to their right, and almost ere it had died away,\r\nRokens himself staggered into the sheltering cleft of rock, accompanied\r\nby Phil Briant.\r\n\r\nSome of the men who had faced the dangers to which they had been exposed\r\nwith firm nerves and unblanched cheeks, now grew pale, and trembled\r\nviolently, for they actually believed that the spirits of their lost\r\nshipmates had come to haunt them.  But these superstitious fears were\r\nsoon put to flight by the hearty voice of the harpooner, who shook\r\nhimself like a great Newfoundland dog as he came up, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Why, wot on airth has brought ye all here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we may say, what has brought _you_ here?\" replied the captain,\r\nas he grasped them each by the hand and shook them with as much energy\r\nas if he had not met them for ten years past.\r\n\r\n\"It's aisy to tell that,\" said Briant, as he crouched down in the midst\r\nof the group; \"Tim and me wos blow'd right across the bank, an' we\r\nshould no doubt ha' bin blow'd right into the sea, but Tim went full\r\nsplit agin one o' the casks o' salt junk, and I went slap agin _him_,\r\nand we lay for a moment all but dead.  Then we crep' in the lee o' the\r\ncask, an' lay there till a lull came, when we clapped on all sail, an'\r\nmade for the shelter o' the rocks, an' shure we got there niver a taste\r\ntoo soon, for it came on to blow the next minit, fit to blow the eyelids\r\noff yer face, it did.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a fact,\" added Rokens.  \"Moreover, we tried to git round to the\r\nhut, but as we wos twice nearly blowed away w'en we tried for to double\r\nthe point, we 'greed to stay where we wos till the back o' the gale\r\nshould be broke.  But, now, let's hear wot's happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hut's gone,\" said Gurney, in reply.  \"Blowed clean over our heads\r\nto--I dun know where.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blowed away?\" cried Rokens and Briant, in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"Not a stick left,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"An' the boat?\" inquired Briant.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone too, I fancy; but we can't be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's all up, boys,\" observed Briant; \"for nearly every morsel o'\r\nthe prog that wos on the top o' the bank is washed away.\"\r\n\r\nThis piece of news fell like a thunderbolt on the men, and no one spoke\r\nfor some minutes.  At last the captain said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, lads, we must do the best we can.  Thank God, we are still alive;\r\nso let us see whether we can't make our present quarters more\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nSetting his men the example, Captain Dunning began to collect the few\r\nboards, and bits of canvas that chanced to have been left on that side\r\nof the rocky ledge when the hut was removed to the other side, and with\r\nthese materials a very partial and insufficient shelter was put up.  But\r\nthe space thus inclosed was so small that they were all obliged to\r\nhuddle together in a mass.  Those farthest from the rock were not\r\naltogether protected from the spray that flew over their heads, while\r\nthose nearest to it were crushed and incommoded by their companions.\r\n\r\nThus they passed that eventful night and all the following day, during\r\nwhich the storm raged with such fury that no one dared venture out to\r\nascertain how much, if any, of their provisions and stores were left to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDuring the second night, a perceptible decrease in the violence of the\r\ngale took place, and before morning it ceased altogether.  The sun rose\r\nin unclouded splendour, sending its bright and warm beams up into the\r\nclear blue sky and down upon the ocean, which glittered vividly as it\r\nstill swelled and trembled with agitation.  All was serene and calm in\r\nthe sky, while below the only sound that broke upon the ear was the deep\r\nand regular dash of the great breakers that fell upon the shores of the\r\nislet, and encircled it with a fringe of purest white.\r\n\r\nOn issuing from their confined uneasy nest in the cleft of the rock,\r\npart of the shipwrecked crew hastened anxiously to the top of the bank\r\nto see how much of their valuable store of food was left, while others\r\nran to the spot in Fairyland where the keel of the new boat had been\r\nlaid.  The latter party found to their joy that all was safe, everything\r\nhaving been well secured; but a terrible sight met the eyes of the other\r\nmen.  Not a vestige of all their store remained!  The summit of the\r\nsandbank was as smooth as on the day they landed there.  Casks, boxes,\r\nbarrels--all were gone; everything had been swept away into the sea!\r\n\r\nAlmost instinctively the men turned their eyes towards the reef on which\r\nthe _Red Eric_ had grounded, each man feeling that in the wrecked vessel\r\nall his hope now remained.  It, too, was gone!  The spot on which it had\r\nlain was now washed by the waves, and a few broken planks and spars on\r\nthe beach were all that remained to remind them of their ocean home!\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other with deep despondency expressed in their\r\ncountenances.  They were haggard and worn from exposure, anxiety, and\r\nwant of rest; and as they stood there in their wet, torn garments, they\r\nlooked the very picture of despair.\r\n\r\n\"There's one chance for us yet, lads,\" exclaimed Tim Rokens, looking\r\ncarefully round the spot on which they stood.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed several of the men eagerly, catching at their\r\ncomrade's words as drowning men are said to catch at straws.\r\n\r\n\"Briant an' me buried some o' the things, by good luck, when we were\r\nsent to make all snug here, an' I'm of opinion they'll be here yet, if\r\nwe could only find the place.  Let me see.\"\r\n\r\nRokens glanced round at the rocks beside which their hut had found\r\nshelter, and at the reef where the ship had been wrecked, in order to\r\nfind the \"bearin's o' the spot,\" as he expressed it.  Then walking a few\r\nyards to one side, he struck his foot on the sand and said, \"It should\r\nbe hereabouts.\"\r\n\r\nThe blow of his heel returned a peculiar hollow sound, very unlike that\r\nproduced by stamping on the mere sand.\r\n\r\n\"Shure ye've hit the very spot, ye have,\" cried Briant, falling on his\r\nknees beside the place; and scraping up the sand with both hands.  \"It\r\nsounds uncommon like a bread-cask.  Here it is.  Hurrah! boys, lind a\r\nhand, will ye.  There now, heave away; but trate it tinderly!  Shure\r\nit's the only friend we've got in the wide world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're all wrong, Phil,\" cried Gurney, who almost at the same moment\r\nbegan to scrape another hole close by.  \"It's not our only one; here's\r\nanother friend o' the same family.  Bear a hand, lads!\"\r\n\r\n\"And here's another!\" cried Ailie, with a little scream of delight, as\r\nshe observed the rim of a small keg just peeping out above the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Ailie,\" cried Glynn, as he ran to the spot and quickly dug\r\nup the keg in question, which, however, proved to be full of nails, to\r\nAilie's great disappointment, for she expected it to have turned out a\r\nkeg of biscuits.\r\n\r\n\"How many casks did you bury?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"It's meself can't tell,\" replied Briant; \"d'ye know, Tim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three, I think; but we was in sich a hurry that I ain't sartin\r\nexactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, boys, look here!\" continued the captain, drawing a pretty\r\nlarge circle on the sand, \"set to work like a band of moles an' dig up\r\nevery inch o' that till you come to the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your sort,\" cried Rokens, plunging elbow-deep into the sand at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! then, here's at ye; a fair field an' no favour at any price,\"\r\nshouted Briant, baring his arms, straddling his legs, and sending a\r\nshower of sand behind him that almost overwhelmed Gurney, before that\r\nstout little individual could get out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the men were farther rejoiced by the coming up of the\r\nother party, bearing the good news that the keel of the boat was safe,\r\nas well as all her planking and the carpenter's tools, which fortunately\r\nhappened to have been secured in a sheltered spot.  From the depths of\r\ndespair they were all suddenly raised to renewed and sanguine hope, so\r\nthat they wrought with the energy of gold-diggers, and soon their toil\r\nwas rewarded by the discovery of that which, in their circumstances,\r\nthey would not have exchanged for all the golden nuggets that ever were\r\nor will be dug up from the prolific mines of Australia, California, or\r\nBritish Columbia, namely, three casks of biscuit, a small keg of wine, a\r\ncask of fresh water, a roll of tobacco, and a barrel of salt junk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR A LONG VOYAGE--BRIANT PROVES THAT GHOSTS CAN DRINK--\r\nJACKO ASTONISHES HIS FRIENDS, AND SADDENS HIS ADOPTED MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\"Wot _I_ say is one thing; wot _you_ say is another--so it is.  I dun\r\nknow w'ich is right, or w'ich is wrong--no more do you.  P'raps you is,\r\np'raps I is; anywise we can't both on us be right or both on us be\r\nwrong--that's a comfort, if it's nothin' else.  Wot _you_ say is--that\r\nit's morally imposs'ble for a crew sich as us to travel over two\r\nthousand miles of ocean on three casks o' biscuit and a barrel o' salt\r\njunk.  Wot _I_ say is--that we can, an', moreover, that morals has\r\nnothin' to do with it wotsomediver.  Now, wot then?\"\r\n\r\nTim Rokens paused and looked at Gurney, to whom his remarks were\r\naddressed, as if he expected an answer.  That rotund little seaman did\r\nnot, however, appear to be thoroughly prepared to reply to \"wot then,\"\r\nfor he remained silent, but looked at his comrade as though to say,\r\n\"I'll be happy to learn wisdom from your sagacious lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot then?\" repeated Tim Rokens, assaulting his knee with his clenched\r\nfist in a peculiarly emphatic manner; \"I'll tell ye wot then, as you may\r\nbe right and I may be right, an' nother on us can be both right or\r\nwrong, I say as how that we don't know nothin' about it.\"\r\n\r\nGurney looked as if he did not quite approve of so summary a method of\r\nsolving such a knotty question, but observing from the expression of\r\nRokens' countenance that, though he had paused, that philosopher had not\r\nyet concluded, he remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"An', furthermore,\" continued Tim, \"it's my opinion--seein' that we're\r\nboth on us in such a state o' cumblebofubulation, an' don't know\r\nnothin'--we'd better go an' ax the cap'en, who does.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ may save yourselves the trouble,\" observed Glynn Proctor, who at\r\nthat moment came up and sat down on the rocks beside them, with a piece\r\nof the salt junk that formed an element in the question at issue, in his\r\nhand--\r\n\r\n\"I've just heard the captain give his opinion on that subject, and he\r\nsays that the boat can be got ready in a week or less, and that, with\r\nstrict economy, the provisions we have will last us long enough to\r\nenable us to make the Cape, supposing we have good weather and fair\r\nwinds.  That's _his_ opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told ye so,\" said Tim Rokens.\r\n\r\n\"You did nothin' o' the sort,\" retorted Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if ye come fur to be oncommon strick in the use o' your lingo, I\r\ndid _not_ 'xactly tell ye so, but I _thought_ so, w'ich is all the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't all the same,\" replied Gurney, whose temper seemed to have\r\nbeen a little soured by the prospects before him, \"and you don't need to\r\ngo for to be talkin' there like a great Solon as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot's a Solon?\" inquired Tim.\r\n\r\n\"Solon was a man as thought his-self a great feelosopher, but he worn't,\r\nhe wor an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'm like Solon,\" retorted Rokens, \"you're like a Solon-goose, w'ich\r\nis an animal as _don't_ think itself an ass, 'cause its too great a one\r\nto know it.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus floored his adversary, the philosophic mariner turned to\r\nGlynn and said--\r\n\r\n\"In course we can't expect to be on full allowance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, old boy; the captain remarked, just as I left him, that\r\nwe'd have to be content with short allowance--very short allowance\r\nindeed.\"\r\n\r\nGurney sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\"How much?\" inquired Tim.\r\n\r\n\"About three ounces of biscuit, one ounce of salt junk, and a quarter of\r\na pint of water per day.\"\r\n\r\nGurney groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n\"You, of all men,\" said Glynn, \"have least reason to complain, Gurney,\r\nfor you've got fat enough on your own proper person to last you a week\r\nat least!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, a fortnight, or more,\" added Rokens; \"an' even then ye'd scarcely\r\nbe redooced to a decent size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but,\" pleaded Gurney, \"you scarecrow creatures don't know how\r\nhorrid sore the process o' comin' down is.  An' one gets so cold, too.\r\nIt's just like taking off yer clo's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sarves ye right for puttin' on so many,\" said Rokens, as he rose to\r\nresume work, which he and Gurney had left off three-quarters of an hour\r\nbefore, in order to enjoy a quiet, philosophical _tete-a-tete_ during\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\"It's a bad business, that of the planking not being sufficient to deck\r\nor even half-deck the boat,\" observed Glynn, as they went together\r\ntowards the place where the new boat was being built.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied Rokens; \"but it's a good thing that we've got plenty of\r\ncanvas to spare.  It won't make an overly strong deck, to be sure; but\r\nit's better than nothin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"A heavy sea would burst it in no time,\" remarked Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"We must hope to escape heavy seas, then,\" said Glynn, as they parted,\r\nand went to their several occupations.\r\n\r\nThe boat that was now building with the most urgent despatch, had a keel\r\nof exactly twenty-three feet long, and her breadth, at the widest part,\r\nwas seven feet.  She was being as well and firmly put together as the\r\nmaterials at their command would admit of, and, as far as the work had\r\nyet proceeded, she bid fair to become an excellent boat, capable of\r\ncontaining the whole crew, and their small quantity of provisions.  This\r\nlast was diminishing so rapidly, that Captain Dunning resolved to put\r\nall hands at once on short allowance.  Notwithstanding this, the men\r\nworked hard and hopefully; for, as each plank and nail was added to\r\ntheir little bark, they felt as if they were a step nearer home.  The\r\ncaptain and the doctor, however, and one or two of the older men, could\r\nnot banish from their minds the fact that the voyage they were about to\r\nundertake was of the most perilous nature, and one which, in any other\r\nthan the hopeless circumstances in which they were placed at that time,\r\nwould have been regarded as the most desperate of forlorn hopes.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen souls to be tossed about on the wide and stormy sea, during\r\nmany weeks, it might be months, in a small open boat, crowded together\r\nand cramped, without sufficient covering, and on short allowance of\r\nfood, was indeed a dreary prospect, even for the men--how much more so\r\nfor the delicate child who shared their trials and sufferings?  Captain\r\nDunning's heart sank within him when he thought of it; but he knew how\r\ngreat an influence the conduct and bearing of a commander has, in such\r\ncircumstances, on his men; so he strove to show a smiling, cheerful\r\ncountenance, though oftentimes he carried a sad and anxious heart in his\r\nbosom.  To the doctor and Tim Rokens alone did he reveal his inmost\r\nthoughts, because he knew that he could trust them, and felt that he\r\nneeded their advice and sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe work progressed so rapidly, that in a few days more the boat\r\napproached completion, and preparations were being made in earnest for\r\nfinally quitting the little isle on which they had found a home for so\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by the captain that as the work of boat-building drew to\r\na close, Glynn Proctor continued to labour long after the others had\r\nretired to rest, wearied with the toils of the day--toils which they\r\nwere not now so well able to bear as heretofore, on account of the\r\nslight want of vigour caused by being compelled to live on half\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nOne evening the captain went down to the building yard in Fairyland, and\r\nsaid to Glynn--\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, my boy! at it yet?  Why, what are you making?  A dog-kennel,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not exactly that,\" replied Glynn, laughing.  \"You'll hardly guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say it was a house for Jacko, only it seems much too big.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just possible that Jacko may have a share in it,\" said Glynn; \"but\r\nit's not for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, then?  Not for yourself, surely!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's for Ailie,\" cried Glynn gleefully.  \"Don't you think it will be\r\nrequired?\" he added, looking up, as if he half feared the captain would\r\nnot permit his contrivance to be used.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe it will, my boy.  I had intended to get some sort of\r\ncovering for my dear Ailie put up in the stern-sheets; but I did not\r\nthink of absolutely making a box for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you'll find it will be a capital thing at nights.  I know she could\r\nnever stand the exposure, and canvas don't keep out the rain well; so I\r\nthought of rigging up a large box, into which she can creep.  I'll make\r\nair-holes in the roof that will let in air, but not water; and I'll\r\ncaulk the seams with oakum, so as to keep it quite dry inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my boy, it's very kind of you to take so much thought for my\r\npoor child.  Yet she deserves it, Glynn, and we can't be too careful of\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain patted the youth on the shoulder, and, leaving him to\r\ncontinue his work, went to see Gurney, who had been ailing a little\r\nduring the last few days.  Brandy, in small quantities, had been\r\nprescribed by the doctor, and, fortunately, two bottles of that spirit\r\nhad been swept from the wreck.  Being their whole stock, Captain Dunning\r\nhad stowed it carefully away in what he deemed a secret and secure\r\nplace; but it turned out that some member of the crew was not so strict\r\nin his principles of temperance as could be desired; for, on going to\r\nthe spot to procure the required medicine, it was found that one of the\r\nbottles was gone.\r\n\r\nThis discovery caused the captain much anxiety and sorrow, for, besides\r\ninflicting on them the loss of a most valuable medicine, it proved that\r\nthere was a thief in their little society.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?  To pass it over in silence would have shown\r\nweakness, which, especially in the circumstances in which they were at\r\nthat time placed, might have led at last to open mutiny.  To discover\r\nthe thief was impossible.  The captain's mind was soon made up.  He\r\nsummoned every one of the party before him, and, after stating the\r\ndiscovery he had made, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, I'm not going to charge any of you with having done this\r\nthing, but I cannot let it pass without warning you that if I discover\r\nany of you being guilty of such practices in future, I'll have the man\r\ntied up and give him three dozen with a rope's-end.  You know I have\r\nnever resorted, as many captains are in the habit of doing, to corporal\r\npunishment.  I don't like it.  I've sailed in command of ships for many\r\nyears, and have never found it needful; but now, more than ever, strict\r\ndiscipline must be maintained; and I tell you, once for all, that I mean\r\nto maintain it _at any cost_.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was received in silence.  All perceived the justice of it,\r\nyet some felt that, until the thief should be discovered, they\r\nthemselves would lie under suspicion.  A few there were, indeed, whose\r\nwell-known and long-established characters raised them above suspicion,\r\nbut there were others who knew that their character had not yet been\r\nestablished on so firm a basis, and they felt that until the matter\r\nshould be cleared up, their honesty would be, mentally at least, called\r\nin question by their companions.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the disposition to mutiny related in a previous\r\nchapter, this was the first cloud that had risen to interrupt the\r\nharmony of the shipwrecked sailors, and as they returned to their work,\r\nsundry suggestions and remarks were made in reference to the possibility\r\nof discovering the delinquent.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think it wos poss'ble,\" said Rokens.  \"I thought as how there\r\nwasn't a man in the ship as could ha' done sich a low, mean thing as\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more did I,\" said Dick Barnes.\r\n\r\n\"Wall, boys,\" observed Nikel Sling emphatically, \"I guess as how that I\r\ndon't believe it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah!  D'ye think the bottle o' brandy stole his-self?\" inquired\r\nBriant.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't a-goin' fur to say that; but a ghost might ha' done it, p'raps,\r\na-purpose to get us into a scrape.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight laugh at this, and from that moment the other men\r\nsuspected that Sling was the culprit.  The mere fact of his being the\r\nfirst to charge the crime upon any one else--even a ghost--caused them,\r\nin spite of themselves, to come to this conclusion.  They did not,\r\nhowever, by word or look, show what was passing in their minds, for the\r\nYankee was a favourite with his comrades, and each felt unwilling that\r\nhis suspicion should prove to be correct.\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said Tarquin, who feared that suspicion might\r\nattach to himself, seeing that he had been the ringleader in the recent\r\nmutiny; \"I don't believe that ghosts drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! that's all ye know!\" cried Phil Briant.  \"Av ye'd only lived a\r\nmonth or two in Owld Ireland, ye'd have seen raison to change yer mind,\r\nye would.  Sure I've seed a ghost the worse o' liquor meself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Phil, wot a stunner!\" cried Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"It's as true as me name's Phil Briant--more's the pity.  Did I niver\r\ntell ye o' the Widdy Morgan, as had a ghost come to see her frequently?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never--let's hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop that noise with yer hammer, then, Tim Rokens, jist for five\r\nminutes, and I'll tell it ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe men ceased work for a few minutes while their comrade spoke as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n\"It's not a long story, boys, but it's long enough to prove that ghosts\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n\"Ye must know that wance upon a time there wos a widdy as lived in a\r\nsmall town in the county o' Clare, in Owld Ireland, an' oh! but that was\r\nthe place for drinkin' and fightin'.  It wos there that I learned to use\r\nme sippers; and it wos there, too, that I learned to give up drinkin',\r\nfor I comed for to see what a mighty dale o' harm it did to my poor\r\ncountrymen.  The sexton o' the place was the only man as niver wint near\r\nthe grog-shop, and no wan iver seed him overtook with drink, but it was\r\na quare thing that no wan could rightly understand why he used to\r\n_smell_ o' drink very bad sometimes.  There wos a young widdy in that\r\ntown, o' the name o' Morgan, as kep' a cow, an' owned a small cabin, an'\r\na patch o' tater-ground about the size o' the starn sheets of our owld\r\nlong-boat.  She wos a great deal run after, wos this widdy--not that the\r\nyoung lads had an eye to the cow, or the cabin, or the tater-estate, by\r\nno manes--but she wos greatly admired, she wos.  I admired her meself,\r\nand wint to see her pretty fraquent.  Well, wan evenin' I wint to see\r\nher, an' says I, `Mrs Morgan, did ye iver hear the bit song called the\r\nWiddy Machree?'  `Sure I niver did,' says she.  `Would ye like to hear\r\nit, darlint?' says I.  So she says she would, an' I gave it to her right\r\noff; an' when I'd done, says I, `Now, Widdy Morgan, ochone! will ye take\r\n_me_?'  But she shook her head, and looked melancholy.  `Ye ain't\r\na-goin' to take spasms?' said I, for I got frightened at her looks.\r\n`No,' says she; `but there's a sacret about me; an' I like ye too well,\r\nPhil, to decaive ye; if ye only know'd the sacret, ye wouldn't have me\r\nat any price.'\r\n\r\n\"`Wouldn't I?' says I; `try me, cushla, and see av I won't.'\r\n\r\n\"`Phil Briant,' says she, awful solemn like, `I'm haunted.'\r\n\r\n\"`Haunted!' says I; `'av coorse ye are, bliss yer purty face; don't I\r\nknow that ivery boy in the parish is after ye?'\r\n\r\n\"`It's not that I mane.  It's a ghost as haunts me.  It haunts me cabin,\r\nand me cow, and me tater-estate; an' it drinks.'\r\n\r\n\"`Now, darlint,' says I, `everybody knows yer aisy frightened about\r\nghosts.  I don't belave in one meself, an' I don't mind 'em a farden\r\ndip; but av all the ghosts in Ireland haunted ye, I'd niver give ye up.'\r\n\r\n\"`Will ye come an' see it this night?' says she.\r\n\r\n\"`Av coorse I will,' says I.  An' that same night I wint to her cabin,\r\nand she let me in, and put a candle on the table, an' hid me behind a\r\ngreat clock, in a corner jist close by the cupboard, where the\r\nbrandy-bottle lived.  Then she lay down on her bed with her clo's on,\r\nand pulled the coverlid over her, and pretinded to go to slape.  In less\r\nnor half-an-hour I hears a fut on the doorstep; then a tap at the door,\r\nwhich opened, it seemed to me, of its own accord, and in walks the\r\nghost, sure enough!  It was covered all over from head to fut in a white\r\nsheet, and I seed by the way it walked that it wos the worse of drink.\r\nI wos in a mortal fright, ye may be sure, an' me knees shuk to that\r\nextint ye might have heard them rattle.  The ghost walks straight up to\r\nthe cupboard, takes out the brandy-bottle, and fills out a whole tumbler\r\nquite full, and drinks it off; it did, the baste, ivery dhrop.  I seed\r\nit with me two eyes, as sure as I'm a-standin' here.  It came into the\r\nhouse drunk, an' it wint out drunker nor it came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" exclaimed several of Briant's auditors.\r\n\r\n\"All! av coorse it is.  Wot more would ye have?  Didn't I say that I'd\r\ntell ye a story as would prove to ye that ghosts drink, more especially\r\nIrish ghosts?  To be sure it turned out afterwards that the ghost was\r\nthe sexton o' the parish as took advantage o' the poor widdy's fears;\r\nbut I can tell ye, boys, that ghost niver came back after the widdy\r\nbecame Mrs Briant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then ye married the widder, did ye?\" said Jim Scroggles.\r\n\r\n\"I did; an' she's alive and hearty this day av she's not--\"\r\n\r\nBriant was interrupted by a sudden roar of laughter from the men, who at\r\nthat moment caught sight of Jacko, the small monkey, in a condition of\r\nmind and body that, to say the least of it, did him no credit.  We are\r\nsorry to be compelled to state that Jacko was evidently and undoubtedly\r\ntipsy.  Gurney said he was \"as drunk as a fiddler.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot take upon ourself to say whether he was or was not as drunk as\r\nthat.  We are rather inclined to think that fiddlers, as a class, are\r\nmaligned, and that they are no worse than their neighbours in this\r\nrespect, perhaps not so bad.  Certainly, if any fiddler really deserves\r\nthe imputation, it must be a violoncello player, because he is, properly\r\nspeaking, a base-fiddler.\r\n\r\nBe this, however, as it may, Jacko was unmistakably drunk--in a maudlin\r\nstate of intoxication--drunker, probably, than ever a monkey was before\r\nor since.  He appeared, as he came slowly staggering forward to the\r\nplace where the men were at work on the boat, to have just wakened out\r\nof his first drunken sleep, for his eyes were blinking like the orbs of\r\nan owl in the sunshine, and in his walk he placed his right foot where\r\nhis left should have gone, and his left foot where his right should have\r\ngone, occasionally making a little run forward to save himself from\r\ntumbling on his nose, and then pulling suddenly up, and throwing up his\r\narms in order to avoid falling on his back.  Sometimes he halted\r\naltogether,--and swayed to and fro, gazing, meanwhile, pensively at the\r\nground, as if he were wondering why it had taken to rolling and\r\nearthquaking in that preposterous manner; or were thinking on the\r\nbald-headed mother he had left behind him in the African wilderness.\r\nWhen the loud laugh of the men saluted his ears, Jacko looked up as\r\nquickly and steadily as he could, and grinned a ghastly smile--or\r\nsomething like it--as if to say, \"What are you laughing at, villains?\"\r\n\r\nIt is commonly observed that, among men, the ruling passion comes out\r\nstrongly when they are under the influence of strong drink.  So it is\r\nwith monkeys.  Jacko's ruling passion was thieving; but having, at that\r\ntime, no particular inducement to steal, he indulged his next ruling\r\npassion--that of affection--by holding out both arms, and staggering\r\ntowards Phil Briant to be taken up.\r\n\r\nA renewed burst of laughter greeted this movement.  \"It knows ye, Phil,\"\r\ncried Jim Scroggles.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then, so it should, for it's meself as is good to it.  Come to its\r\nuncle, then.  O good luck to yer purty little yaller face.  So it wos\r\nyou stole the brandy, wos it?  Musha! but ye might have know'd ye\r\nbelonged to a timp'rance ship, so ye might.\"\r\n\r\nJacko spread his arms on Briant's broad chest--they were too short to go\r\nround his neck--laid his head thereon, and sighed.  Perhaps he felt\r\npenitent on account of his wickedness; but it is more probable that he\r\nfelt uneasy in body rather than in mind.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Briant,\" cried Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"That's me,\" answered the other.\r\n\r\n\"If you are Jacko's self-appointed uncle, and Miss Ailie is his adopted\r\nmother, wot relation is Miss Ailie to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You never does nothin' right, Gurney,\" interposed Nikel Sling; \"you\r\ncan't even preepound a pruposition.  Here's how you oughter to ha' put\r\nit.  If Phil Briant be Jacko's uncle, and Miss Ailie his adopted\r\nmother--all three bein' related in a sorter way by bein' shipmates, an'\r\nall on us together bein' closely connected in vartue of our bein'\r\nmessmates--wot relation is Gurney to a donkey?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a puzzler,\" said Gurney, affecting to consider the question\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a puzzler wot'll beat it, though,\" observed Tim Rokens; \"suppose\r\nwe all go on talkin' stuff till doomsday, w'en'll the boat be finished?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" cried Dick Barnes, resuming work with redoubled energy;\r\n\"take that young thief to his mother, Phil, and tell her to rope's-end\r\nhim.  I'm right glad to find, though, that he _is_ the thief arter all,\r\nand not one o' us.\"\r\n\r\nOn examination being made, it was found that the broken and empty\r\nbrandy-bottle lay on the floor of the monkey's nest, and it was\r\nconjectured, from the position in which it was discovered, that that\r\ndissipated little creature, having broken off the neck in order to get\r\nat the brandy, had used the body of the bottle as a pillow whereon to\r\nlay its drunken little head.  Luckily for its own sake, it had spilt the\r\ngreater part of the liquid, with which everything in its private\r\nresidence was saturated and perfumed.\r\n\r\nOn having ocular demonstration of the depravity of her pet, Ailie at\r\nfirst wept, then, on beholding its eccentric movements, she laughed in\r\nspite of herself.\r\n\r\nAfter that, she wept again, and spoke to it reproachfully, but failed to\r\nmake the slightest impression on its hardened little heart.  Then she\r\nput it to bed, and wrapped it up carefully in its sailcloth blanket.\r\n\r\nWith this piece of unmerited kindness Jacko seemed touched, for he said,\r\n\"Oo-oo--oo-oo--ooee-ee!\" once or twice in a peculiarly soft and\r\npenitential tone, after which he dropped into a calm, untroubled\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE BOAT FINISHED--FAREWELL TO FAIRYLAND--ONCE MORE AT SEA.\r\n\r\nAt last the boat was finished.  It had two masts and two lug-sails, and\r\npulled eight oars.  There was just sufficient room in it to enable the\r\nmen to move about freely, but it required a little management to enable\r\nthem to stow themselves away when they went to sleep, and had they\r\npossessed the proper quantity of provisions for their contemplated\r\nvoyage, there is no doubt that they would have found themselves\r\nconsiderably cramped.  The boat was named the _Maid of the Isle_, in\r\nmemory of the sandbank on which she had been built, and although in her\r\ngeneral outline and details she was rather a clumsy craft, she was\r\nserviceable and strongly put together.\r\n\r\nHad she been decked, or even half-decked, the voyage which now began\r\nwould not have been so desperate an undertaking; but having been only\r\ncovered in part with a frail tarpaulin, she was not at all fitted to\r\nface the terrible storms that sometimes sweep the southern seas.  Each\r\nman, as he gazed at her, felt that his chance of ultimate escape was\r\nvery small indeed.  Still, the men had now been so long contemplating\r\nthe voyage and preparing for it, and they had become so accustomed to\r\nrisk their lives upon the sea, that they set out upon this voyage at\r\nlast in cheerful spirits, and even jested about the anticipated dangers\r\nand trials which they knew full well awaited them.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning, that on which the wrecked crew of the whaler\r\nbade adieu to \"Fairyland,\" as the islet had been named by Ailie--a name\r\nthat was highly, though laughingly, approved of by the men.  The ocean\r\nand sky presented that mysterious co-mingling of their gorgeous elements\r\nthat irresistibly call forth the wonder and admiration of even the most\r\nunromantic and matter-of-fact men.  It was one of Ailie's peculiarly\r\nbeloved skies.  You could not, without much consideration, have decided\r\nas to where was the exact line at which the glassy ocean met the clear\r\nsky, and it was almost impossible to tell, when gazing at the horizon,\r\nwhich were the real clouds and which the reflections.\r\n\r\nThe bright blue vault above was laden with clouds of the most gorgeous\r\ndescription, in which all the shades of pearly-grey and yellow were\r\nmingled and contrasted.  They rose up, pile upon pile, in stupendous\r\nmajesty, like the very battlements of heaven, while their images, clear\r\nand distinct almost as themselves, rolled down and down into the watery\r\ndepths, until the islet--the only well-defined and solid object in the\r\nscene--appeared to float in their midst.  The rising sun shot throughout\r\nthe vast immensity of space, and its warm rays were interrupted, and\r\nbroken, and caught, and absorbed, and reflected in so many magical ways,\r\nthat it was impossible to trace any of the outlines for more than a few\r\nseconds, ere the eye was lost in the confusion of bright lights and deep\r\nshadows that were mingled and mellowed together by the softer lights and\r\nshades of every degree of depth and tint into splendid harmony.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this scene Captain Dunning stood, with Ailie by his\r\nside, and surrounded by his men, on the shores of the little island.\r\nEverything was now in readiness to set sail.  The boat was laden, and in\r\nthe water, and the men stood ready to leap in and push off.\r\n\r\n\"My lads,\" said the captain, earnestly, \"we're about to quit this morsel\r\nof sandbank on which it pleased the Almighty to cast our ship, and on\r\nwhich, thanks be to Him, we have found a pretty safe shelter for so\r\nlong.  I feel a sort o' regret almost at leavin' it now.  But the time\r\nhas come for us to begin our voyage towards the Cape, and I need\r\nscarcely repeat what you all know well enough--that our undertakin' is\r\nno child's play.  We shall need all our bodily and our mental powers to\r\ncarry us through.  Our labour must be constant, and our food is not\r\nsufficient, so that we must go on shorter allowance from this day.  I\r\ngave you half rations while ye were buildin' the boat, because we had to\r\nget her finished and launched as fast as we could, but now we can't\r\nafford to eat so much.  I made a careful inspection of our provisions\r\nlast night, and I find that by allowing every man four ounces a day, we\r\ncan spin it out.  We may fall in with islands, perhaps, but I know of\r\nnone in these seas--there are none put down on the charts--and we may\r\nget hold of a fish now and then, but we must not count on these chances.\r\nNow it must be plain to all of you that our only chance of getting on\r\nwell together in circumstances that will try our tempers, no doubt, and\r\nrouse our selfishness, is to resolve firmly before starting--each man\r\nfor himself--that we will lay restraint on ourselves and try to help\r\neach other as much as we can.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a ready murmur of assent to this proposal; then the captain\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, one word more.  Our best efforts, let us exert ourselves\r\never so much, cannot be crowned with success unless before setting out,\r\nwe ask the special favour and blessing of Him who, we are told in the\r\nBible, holds the waters of the ocean in the hollow of His hand.  If He\r\nhelps us, we shall be saved; if He does not help us, we shall perish.\r\nWe will therefore offer up a prayer now, in the name of our blessed\r\nRedeemer, that we may be delivered from every danger, and be brought at\r\nlast in peace and comfort to our homes.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning then clasped his hands together, and while the men\r\naround him reverently bowed their heads, he offered up a short and\r\nsimple, but earnest prayer to God.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward they continued the habit of offering up prayer\r\ntogether once a day, and soon afterwards the captain began the practice\r\nof reading a chapter aloud daily out of Ailie's Bible.  The result of\r\nthis was that not only were the more violent spirits among them\r\nrestrained, under frequent and sore privations and temptations, but all\r\nthe party were often much comforted and filled with hope at times when\r\nthey were by their sufferings well-nigh driven to despair.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to leave Fairyland, papa,\" said Ailie sadly, as the men\r\nshoved the _Maid of the Isle_ into deep water and pulled out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"So am I, dear,\" replied the captain sitting down beside his daughter in\r\nthe stern-sheets of the boat, and taking the tiller; \"I had no idea I\r\ncould have come to like such a barren bit of sand so well.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause after this remark.  Every eye in the boat was\r\nturned with a sad expression on the bright-yellow sandbank as they rowed\r\naway, and the men dipped their oars lightly into the calm waters, as if\r\nthey were loth to leave their late home.\r\n\r\nAny spot of earth that has been for some time the theatre of\r\nheart-stirring events, such as rouse men's strong emotions, and on which\r\nhappy and hopeful as well as wretched days have been spent, will so\r\nentwine itself with the affections of men that they will cling to it and\r\nlove it, more or less powerfully, no matter how barren may be the spot\r\nor how dreary its general aspect.  The sandbank had been the cause, no\r\ndoubt, of the wreck of the _Red Eric_, but it had also been the means,\r\nunder God, of saving the crew and affording them shelter during many\r\nsucceeding weeks--weeks of deep anxiety, but also of healthful, hopeful,\r\nenergetic toil, in which, if there were many things to create annoyance\r\nor fear, there had also been not a few things to cause thankfulness,\r\ndelight, and amusement.\r\n\r\nUnknown to themselves, these rough sailors and the tender child had\r\nbecome attached to the spot, and it was only now that they were about to\r\nleave it for ever that they became aware of the fact.  The circumscribed\r\nand limited range on which their thoughts and vision had been bent for\r\nthe last few weeks, had rendered each individual as familiar with every\r\ninch of the bank as if he had dwelt there for years.\r\n\r\nAilie gazed at the low rocks that overhung the crystal pool in\r\nFairyland, until the blinding tears filled her eyes, and she felt all\r\nthe deep regret that is experienced by the little child when it is\r\nforcibly torn from an old and favourite toy--regret that is not in the\r\nleast degree mitigated by the fact that the said toy is but a sorry\r\naffair, a doll, perchance, with a smashed head, eyes thrust out, and\r\nnose flattened on its face or rubbed away altogether--it matters not;\r\nthe long and happy hours and days spent in the companionship of that\r\nbattered little mass of wood or wax rush on the infant memory like a\r\ndear delightful dream, and it weeps on separation as if its heart would\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nEach man in the boat's crew experienced more or less of the same\r\nfeeling, and commented, according to his nature, either silently or\r\naudibly, on each familiar object as he gazed upon it for the last time.\r\n\r\n\"There's the spot where we built the hut when we first landed, Ailie,\"\r\nsaid Glynn, who pulled the aft oar; \"d'ye see it?--just coming into\r\nview; look!  There it will be shut out again in a moment by the rock\r\nbeside the coral-pool.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it!\" exclaimed Ailie eagerly, as she brushed away the tears from\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There's the rock, too, where we used to make our fire,\" said the\r\ncaptain, pointing it out.  \"It doesn't look like itself from this point\r\nof view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed Phil Briant, \"an' it wos at the fut o' that, too, where we\r\nused to bile the kittle night an' mornin'.  Sure it's many a swait bit\r\nand pipe I had beside ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a bit o' the wreck?\" inquired Tim Rokens, pointing to the low\r\nrocky point with the eagerness of a man who had made an unexpected\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr Millons, shading his eyes with his hands, and gazing\r\nat the object in question, \"it's himpossible.  I searched every bit o'\r\nthe bank for a plank before we came hoff, an' couldn't find a morsel as\r\nbig as my 'and.  W'at say you, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think with you,\" answered Dr Hopley; \"but here's the telescope,\r\nwhich will soon settle the question.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the doctor adjusted the glass, Rokens muttered that \"He wos sure\r\nit wos a bit o' the wreck,\" and that \"there wos a bit o' rock as nobody\r\ncouldn't easy git a t'other side of to look, and that that wos it, and\r\nthe bit of wreck was there,\" and much to the same effect.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Lay on your oars, lads, a moment,\" said the captain, taking the glass\r\nand applying it to his eye.\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed gladly, for they experienced an unaccountable\r\ndisinclination to row away from the island.  Perhaps the feeling was\r\ncaused in part by the idea that when they took their last look at it, it\r\nmight possibly be their _last_ sight of land.\r\n\r\n\"It's a small piece of the foretopmast crosstrees,\" observed the\r\ncaptain, shutting up the telescope and resuming his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go back an' pick it up, sir?\" asked Dick Barnes gravely,\r\ngiving vent to the desires of his heart, without perceiving at the\r\nmoment the absurdity of the question.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what would you do with it, Dick?\" replied the captain, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, ye couldn't ait it!\" interposed Briant; \"but afther all, there's\r\nno sayin'.  Maybe Nikel Sling could make a tasty dish out of it stewed\r\nin oakum and tar.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be purlite to take such a tit-bit from the mermaids,\"\r\nobserved Gurney, as the oars were once more dipped reluctantly, in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe men smiled at the jest, for in the monotony of sea life every\r\nspecies of pleasantry, however poor, is swallowed with greater or less\r\navidity; but the smile did not last long.  They were in no jesting\r\nhumour at that time, and no one replied to the passing joke.\r\n\r\nSoon after this a soft gentle breeze sprang up.  It came direct from\r\nFairyland, as if the mermaids referred to by Gurney had been touched by\r\nthe kindly feelings harboured in the sailors' bosoms towards their\r\nislet, and had wafted towards them a last farewell.  The oars were\r\nshipped immediately and the sails hoisted, and, to the satisfaction of\r\nall on board, the _Maid of the Isle_ gave indications of being a swift\r\nsailer, for, although the puff of wind was scarcely sufficient to ruffle\r\nthe glassy surface of the sea, she glided through the water under its\r\ninfluence a good deal faster than she had done with the oars.\r\n\r\n\"That's good!\" remarked the captain, watching the ripples as they passed\r\nastern; \"with fair winds, and not too much of 'em, we shall get on\r\nbravely; so cheer up, my lassie,\" he added, patting Ailie on the head,\r\n\"and let us begin our voyage in good spirits, and with hopeful, trusting\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at Fairyland,\" said Ailie, clasping her father's hand, and\r\npointing towards the horizon.\r\n\r\nAt the moment she spoke, an opening in the great white clouds let a ray\r\nof light fall on the sandbank, which had now passed almost beyond the\r\nrange of vision.  The effect was to illumine its yellow shore and cause\r\nit to shine out for a few seconds like a golden speck on the horizon.\r\nNo one had ceased to gaze at it from the time the boat put forth; but\r\nthis sudden change caused every one to start up, and fix their eyes on\r\nit with renewed interest and intensity.  \"Shall we ever see land again?\"\r\npassed, in one form or another, through the minds of all.  The clouds\r\nswept slowly on the golden point melted away, and the shipwrecked\r\nmariners felt that their little boat was now all the world to them in\r\nthe midst of that mighty world of waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nREDUCED ALLOWANCE OF FOOD--JACKO TEACHES BRIANT A USEFUL LESSON.\r\n\r\nThe first few days of the voyage of the _Maid of the Isle_ were bright\r\nand favourable.  The wind, though light, was fair, and so steady that\r\nthe men were only twice obliged to have recourse to their oars.  The\r\nboat behaved admirably.  Once, during these first days, the wind\r\nfreshened into a pretty stiff breeze, and a somewhat boisterous sea\r\narose, so that she was tested in another of her sailing qualities, and\r\nwas found to be an excellent sea-boat.  Very little water was shipped,\r\nand that little was taken in rather through the awkwardness of King\r\nBumble, who steered, than through the fault of the boat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning had taken care that there should be a large supply of\r\ntin and wooden scoops, for baling out the water that might be shipped in\r\nrough weather, as he foresaw that on the promptness with which this duty\r\nwas performed, might sometimes depend the safety of the boat and crew.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that proved a matter of much regret to the crew, and\r\nthat was the want of a fowling-piece, or firearm of any kind.  Had they\r\npossessed a gun, however old and bad, with ammunition for it, they would\r\nhave been certain, at some period of their voyage, to shoot a few\r\nsea-birds, with which they expected to fall in on approaching the land,\r\neven although many days distant from it.  But having nothing of the\r\nkind, their hope of adding to their slender stock of provisions was very\r\nsmall indeed.  Fortunately, they had one or two fishing-lines, but in\r\nthe deep water, over which for many days they had to sail, fishing was\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nThis matter of the provisions was a source of constant anxiety to\r\nCaptain Dunning.  He had calculated the amount of their stores to an\r\nounce, and ascertained that at a certain rate of distribution they would\r\nbarely serve for the voyage, and this without making any allowance for\r\ninterruptions or detentions.  He knew the exact distance to be passed\r\nover, namely, 2322 miles in a straight line, and he had ascertained the\r\nsailing and rowing powers of the boat and crew; thus he was enabled to\r\narrive at a pretty correct idea of the probable duration of the voyage,\r\nsupposing that all should go well.  But in the event of strong contrary\r\nwinds arising, no fresh supplies of fish or fowl being obtained, or\r\nsickness breaking out among the men, he knew either that they must\r\nstarve altogether, or that he must at once, before it was too late,\r\nstill farther reduce the scanty allowance of food and drink to each man.\r\n\r\nThe captain sat at the helm one fine evening, about a week after their\r\ndeparture from Fairyland, brooding deeply over this subject.  The boat\r\nwas running before a light breeze, at the rate of about four or five\r\nknots, and the men, who had been obliged to row a good part of that day,\r\nwere sitting or reclining on the thwarts, or leaning over the gunwale,\r\nwatching the ripples as they glided by, and enjoying the rest from\r\nlabour; for now that they had been for some time on reduced allowance of\r\nfood, they felt less able for work than they used to be, and often began\r\nto look forward with intense longing to seasons of repose.  Ailie was\r\nsitting near the entrance of her little sleeping apartment--which the\r\nmen denominated a kennel--and master Jacko was seated on the top of it,\r\nscratching his sides and enjoying the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"My lads,\" said the captain, breaking a silence which had lasted a\r\nconsiderable time, \"I'm afraid I shall have to reduce our allowance\r\nstill farther.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was received by Gurney and Phil Briant with a suppressed\r\ngroan--by the other men in silence.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" continued the captain, \"it won't do to count upon chances,\r\nwhich may or may not turn out to be poor.  We can, by fixing our\r\nallowance per man at a lower rate, make quite certain of our food\r\nlasting us until we reach the Cape, even if we should experience a\r\nlittle detention; but if we go on at the present rate, we are equally\r\ncertain that it will fail us just at the last.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're sartain to fall in with birds before we near the land,\" murmured\r\nGurney, with a rueful expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\"We are certain of nothing,\" replied the captain; \"but even suppose we\r\nwere, how are we to get hold of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" observed Briant, who solaced himself with his pipe in the\r\nabsence of a sufficiency of food.  \"Sea-birds, no more nor land-birds,\r\nain't given to pluckin' and roastin' themselves, and flyin' down\r\npeople's throats ready cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" resumed the captain, \"the plan I propose, although it will\r\nentail a little more present self-denial, will, humanly speaking, ensure\r\nour getting through the voyage with life in us even at the worst, and if\r\nwe _are_ so lucky as to catch fish or procure birds in any way, why we\r\nshall fare sumptuously.\"\r\n\r\nHere Tim Rokens, to whom the men instinctively looked, upon all matters\r\nof perplexity, removed his pipe from his lips, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Wot Cap'en Dunnin' says is true.  If we take his plan, why, we'll\r\nstarve in a reg'lar way, little by little, and p'raps spin out till we\r\ngit to the Cape; w'ereas, if we take the other plan, we'll keep a little\r\nfatter on the first part of the voyage, mayhap, but we'll arrive at the\r\nend of it as dead as mutton, every man on us.\"\r\n\r\nThis view of the question seemed so just to the men, and so full of\r\nincontrovertible wisdom, that it was received with something like a\r\nmurmur of applause.\r\n\r\n\"You're a true philosopher, Rokens.  Now Doctor Hopley, I must beg you\r\nto give us your opinion, as a medical man, on this knotty subject,\" said\r\nthe captain, smiling.  \"Do you think that we can continue to exist if\r\nour daily allowance is reduced one-fourth?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor replied, \"Let me see,\" and putting his finger on his\r\nforehead, frowned portentously, affecting to give the subject the most\r\nintense consideration.  He happened to look at Jacko when he frowned,\r\nand that pugnacious individual, happening at the same instant to look at\r\nthe doctor, and supposing that the frown was a distinct challenge to\r\nfight, first raised his eyebrows to the top of his head in amazement,\r\nthen pulled them down over his flashing orbs in deep indignation, and\r\ndisplayed all his teeth, as well as an extent of gums that was really\r\nfrightful to behold!\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Jacko, bad thing,\" said Ailie, in a reproachful tone, pulling the\r\nmonkey towards her.\r\n\r\nTaking no notice of these warlike indications, the doctor, after a few\r\nminutes' thought, looked up and said--\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt whatever that we can stand it.  Most of us are in\r\npretty good condition still, and have some fat to spare.  Fat persons\r\ncan endure reduced allowance of food much better and longer than those\r\nwho are lean.  There's Gurney, now, for instance, he could afford to\r\nhave his share even still further curtailed.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was received with a grin of delighted approval by the men\r\nand with a groan by Gurney, who rubbed his stomach gently, as if that\r\nregion were assailed with pains at the bare thought of such injustice.\r\n\r\n\"Troth, if that's true what ye say, doctor, I hope ye'll see it to be\r\nyer duty to give wot ye cut off Gurney's share to me,\" remarked Briant,\r\n\"for its nothing but a bag o' bones that I am this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh! wot a wopper,\" cried Jim Scroggles, whose lean and lanky person\r\nseemed ill adapted to exist upon light fare.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" observed the captain, \"the doctor and I shall make a careful\r\ncalculation and let you know the result by supper-time, when the new\r\nsystem shall be commenced.  What think you, Ailie, my pet, will you be\r\nable to stand it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, papa, I don't care how much you reduce my allowance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! don't you feel hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ready for supper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not anxious for it, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och!  I wish I wos you,\" murmured Briant, with a deep sigh.  \"I think I\r\ncould ait the foresail, av it wos only well biled with the laste\r\npossible taste o' pig's fat.\"\r\n\r\nBy supper-time the captain announced the future daily allowance, and\r\nserved it out.\r\n\r\nEach man received a piece of salt junk--that is, salt beef--weighing\r\nexactly one ounce; also two ounces of broken biscuit; a small piece of\r\ntobacco, and a quarter of a pint of water.  Although the supply of the\r\nlatter was small, there was every probability of a fresh supply being\r\nobtained when it chanced to rain, so that little anxiety was felt at\r\nfirst in regard to it; but the other portions of each man's allowance\r\nwere weighed with scrupulous exactness, in a pair of scales which were\r\nconstructed by Tim Rokens out of a piece of wood--a leaden musket-ball\r\ndoing service as a weight.\r\n\r\nAilie received an equal portion with the others, but Jacko was doomed to\r\ndrag out his existence on a very minute quantity of biscuit and water.\r\nHe utterly refused to eat salt junk, and would not have been permitted\r\nto use tobacco even had he been so inclined, which he was not.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were thus reduced to a small allowance of food--a smaller\r\nquantity than was sufficient to sustain life for any lengthened period--\r\nno one in the slightest degree grudged Jacko his small portion.  All the\r\nmen entertained a friendly feeling to the little monkey, partly because\r\nit was Ailie's pet, and partly because it afforded them great amusement\r\nat times by its odd antics.\r\n\r\nAs for Jacko himself, he seemed to thrive on short allowance, and never\r\nexhibited any unseemly haste or anxiety at meal-times.  It was observed,\r\nhowever, that he kept an uncommonly sharp eye on all that passed around\r\nhim, as if he felt that his circumstances were at that time peculiar and\r\nworthy of being noted.  In particular he knew to a nicety what happened\r\nto each atom of food, from the time of its distribution among the men to\r\nthe moment of its disappearance within their hungry jaws, and if any\r\npoor fellow chanced to lay his morsel down and neglect it for the tenth\r\npart of an instant, it vanished like a shot, and immediately thereafter\r\nJacko was observed to present an unusually serene and innocent aspect,\r\nand to become suddenly afflicted, with a swelling in the pouch under his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nOne day the men received a lesson in carefulness which they did not soon\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nBreakfast had been served out, and Phil Briant was about to finish his\r\nlast mouthful of biscuit--he had not had many mouthfuls to try his\r\nmasticating powers, poor fellow--when he paused suddenly, and gazing at\r\nthe cherished morsel addressed it thus--\r\n\r\n\"Shure, it's a purty bit, ye are!  Av there wos only wan or two more o'\r\nyer family here, it's meself as 'ud like to be made beknown to them.\r\nI'll not ait ye yit.  I'll look at ye for a little.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this luxurious plan, Briant laid the morsel of biscuit\r\non the thwart of the boat before him, and, taking out his pipe, began to\r\nfill it leisurely, keeping his eye all the time on the last bite.  Just\r\nthen Mr Markham, who pulled the bow oar, called out--\r\n\r\n\"I say, Briant, hand me my tobacco-pouch, it's beside you on the th'ort,\r\nclose under the gun'le.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" said Briant, stretching out his hand to the place indicated,\r\nbut keeping his eye fixed all the time on the piece of biscuit.  \"Ah,\r\nhere it is; ketch it.\"\r\n\r\nFor one instant Briant looked at the second mate in order to throw the\r\npouch with precision.  That instant was sufficient for the exercise of\r\nJacko's dishonest propensities.  The pouch was yet in its passage\r\nthrough the air when a tremendous roar from Tim Rokens apprised the\r\nunhappy Irishman of his misfortune.  He did not require to be told to\r\n\"look out!\" although more than one voice gave him that piece of advice.\r\nAn intuitive perception of irreparable loss flashed across his soul,\r\nand, with the speed of light, his eye was again on the thwart before\r\nhim--but not on the morsel of biscuit.  At that same instant Jacko sat\r\ndown beside Ailie with his usual serene aspect and swelled cheek!\r\n\r\n\"Och, ye bottle imp!\" yelled the bereaved one, \"don't I know ye?\" and\r\nseizing a tin pannikin, in his wrath, he threw it at the small monkey's\r\nhead with a force that would, had it been well directed, have smashed\r\nthat small head effectually.\r\n\r\nJacko made a quick and graceful nod, and the pannikin, just missing\r\nAilie, went over the side into the sea, where it sank and was lost for\r\never, to the regret of all, for they could ill afford to lose it.\r\n\r\n\"Ye've got it, ye have, but ye shan't ait it,\" growled Briant through\r\nhis teeth, as he sprang over the seat towards the monkey.\r\n\r\nJacko bounded like a piece of indiarubber on to Gurney's head; next\r\nmoment he was clinging to the edge of the mainsail, and the next he was\r\ncomfortably seated on the top of the mast, where he proceeded calmly and\r\nleisurely to \"ait\" the biscuit in the face of its exasperated and\r\nrightful owner.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,--Briant!\" exclaimed Ailie, who was half frightened, half amused at\r\nthe sudden convulsion caused by her favourite's bad conduct, \"don't be\r\nvexed; see, here is a little bit of my biscuit; I don't want it--really\r\nI don't.\"\r\n\r\nBriant, who stood aghast and overwhelmed by his loss and by the\r\nconsummate impudence of the small monkey, felt rebuked by this offer.\r\nBursting into a loud laugh, he said, as he resumed his seat and the\r\nfilling of his pipe--\r\n\r\n\"Sure I'd rather ait me own hat, Miss Ailie, an' it's be no means a good\r\nwan--without sarce, too, not even a blot o' mustard--than take the\r\nmorsel out o' yer purty mouth.  I wos more nor half jokin', dear, an' I\r\nax yer parding for puttin' ye in sich a fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Expensive jokin',\" growled Tarquin, \"if ye throw a pannikin overboard\r\nevery time you take to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kape your tongue quiet,\" said Briant, reddening, for he felt somewhat\r\nhumbled at having given way to his anger so easily, and was nettled at\r\nthe remark, coming as it did, in a sneering spirit, from a man for whom\r\nhe had no particular liking.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Briant,\" interposed the captain quickly, with a\r\ngood-humoured laugh; \"I feel for you, lad.  Had it been myself I fear I\r\nshould have been even more exasperated.  I would not sell a crumb of my\r\nportion just now for a guinea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would I,\" added the doctor, \"for a thousand guineas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell ye wot it is, lads,\" remarked Tim Rokens; \"I wish I only had\r\na crumb to sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Rokens, don't be greedy,\" cried Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"Greedy!\" echoed Tim.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, greedy; has any o' you lads got a dickshunairy to lend him?  Come,\r\nJim Scroggles, you can tell him what it means--you've been to school, I\r\nbelieve, hain't you?\"\r\n\r\nRokens shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\"No, lad, I'm not greedy, but I'm ready for wittles.  I won't go fur to\r\ndeny that.  Now, let me ax ye a question.  Wot--supposin' ye had the\r\nchance--would ye give, at this good min'it, for a biled leg o' mutton?\"\r\n\r\n\"With or without capers-sauce?\" inquired Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"W'ichever _you_ please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! we wouldn't need capers-sarse,\" interposed Briant; \"av we only had\r\nthe mutton, I'd cut enough o' capers meself to do for the sarce, I\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters little what you'd give,\" cried Glynn, \"for we can't get it\r\nat any price just now.  Don't you think, captain, that we might have our\r\nbreakfast to-night?  It would save time in the morning, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at this proposal, yet there was a strong\r\nfeeling in the minds of some that if it were consistent with their rules\r\nto have breakfast served out then and there, they would gladly have\r\nconsented to go without it next morning.\r\n\r\nThus, with laugh and jest, and good-natured repartee, did these men bear\r\nthe pangs of hunger for many days.  They were often silent during long\r\nintervals, and sometimes they became talkative and sprightly, but it was\r\nobserved that, whether they conversed earnestly or jestingly, their\r\nconverse ran, for the most part, on eating and drinking, and in their\r\nuneasy slumbers, during the intervals between the hours of work and\r\nwatching, they almost invariably dreamed of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE LONG VOYAGE--STORY-TELLING AND JOURNALISING.\r\n\r\nMany weeks passed away, but the _Maid of the Isle_ still held on her\r\ncourse over the boundless ocean.\r\n\r\nDay after day came and went, the sun rose in the east morning after\r\nmorning, ran its appointed course, and sank, night after night, on the\r\nwestern horizon, but little else occurred to vary the monotony of that\r\nlong, long voyage.  When the sun rose, its bright rays leapt from the\r\nbosom of the ocean; when it set, the same bosom of the great deep\r\nreceived its descending beams.  No land, no sail appeared to the anxious\r\ngazers in that little boat, which seemed to move across, yet never to\r\nreach the boundaries of that mighty circle of water and sky, in the\r\nmidst of which they lay enchained, as if by some wicked enchanter's\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nBreezes blew steadily at times and urged them swiftly on towards the\r\ncircumference, but it fled as fast as they approached.  Then it fell\r\ncalm, and the weary men resumed their oars, and with heavy hearts and\r\nweakened arms tugged at the boat which seemed to have turned into a mass\r\nof lead.  At such times a dead silence was maintained, for the work,\r\nwhich once would have been to them but child's play, had now become\r\nsevere and heavy labour.  Still they did not murmur.  Even the\r\ncross-grained Tarquin became subdued in spirit by the influence of the\r\ncalm endurance and good-humour of his comrades.  But the calms seldom\r\nlasted long.  The winds, which happily continued favourable, again\r\nruffled the surface of the sea, and sometimes blew so briskly as to\r\noblige them to take in a reef or two in their sails.  The oars were\r\ngladly drawn in, and the spirits of the men rose as the little boat bent\r\nover to the blast, lost her leaden qualities, and danced upon the\r\nbroad-backed billows, like a cork.  There was no rain during all this\r\ntime; little or no stormy weather; and, but for their constant exposure\r\nto the hot sun by day and the cold chills by night, the time might have\r\nbeen said to pass even pleasantly, despite the want of a sufficiency of\r\nfood.  Thus day after day and night after night flew by, and week after\r\nweek came and went, and still the _Maid of the Isle_ held on her course\r\nover the boundless ocean.\r\n\r\nDuring all that time the one and a quarter ounces of salt junk and\r\nbiscuit and the eighth of a pint of water were weighed and measured out\r\nto each man, three times a day, with scrupulous care and exactness, lest\r\na drop or a crumb of the food that was more precious than diamonds\r\nshould be lost.  The men had all become accustomed to short allowance\r\nnow, and experienced no greater inconvenience than a feeling of\r\nlassitude, which feeling increased daily, but by such imperceptible\r\ndegrees that they were scarcely conscious of it, and were only\r\noccasionally made aware of the great reduction of their strength when\r\nthey attempted to lift any article which, in the days of their full\r\nvigour, they could have tossed into the air, but which they could\r\nscarcely move now.  When, however, the fair breeze enabled them to glide\r\nalong under sail, and they lay enjoying complete rest, they experienced\r\nno unwonted sensations of weakness; their spirits rose, as the spirits\r\nof sailors always will rise when the waves are rippling at the bow and a\r\nwhite track forming in the wake; and they spent the time--when not\r\nasleep--in cheerful conversation and in the spinning of long yarns.\r\nThey did not sing, however, as might have been expected--they were too\r\nweak for that--they called the feeling \"lazy,\" some said they \"couldn't\r\nbe bothered\" to sing.  No one seemed willing to admit that his strength\r\nwas in reality abated.\r\n\r\nIn story-telling the captain, the doctor, and Glynn shone conspicuous.\r\nAnd when all was going smoothly and well, the anecdotes, histories, and\r\nromances related by these three were listened to with such intense\r\ninterest and delight by the whole crew, that one would have thought they\r\nwere enjoying a pleasure trip, and had no cause whatever for anxiety.\r\nGurney, too, and Briant, and Nikel Sling came out frequently in the\r\nstory-telling line, and were the means of causing many and many an hour\r\nto pass quickly and pleasantly by, which would otherwise have hung\r\nheavily on the hands of all.\r\n\r\nAilie Dunning was an engrossed and delighted listener at all times.  She\r\ndrank in every species of story with an avidity that was quite amusing.\r\nIt seemed also to have been infectious, for even Jacko used to sit hour\r\nafter hour looking steadily at each successive speaker, with a\r\ncountenance so full of bright intelligence, and grave surpassing wisdom,\r\nas to lead one to the belief that he not only understood all that was\r\nsaid, but turned it over in his mind, and drew from it ideas and\r\nconclusions far more bright and philosophical than could have been drawn\r\ntherefrom by any human being, however wise or ingenious.\r\n\r\nHe grinned, too, did Jacko, with an intensity and frequency that induced\r\nthe sailors at first to call him a clever dog, in the belief that his\r\nperception of the ludicrous was very strong indeed; but as his grins\r\nwere observed to occur quite as frequently at the pathetic and the grave\r\nas at the comical parts of the stories, they changed their minds, and\r\nsaid he was a \"codger\"--in which remark they were undoubtedly safe,\r\nseeing that it committed them to nothing very specific.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning's stories were, more properly speaking, histories, and\r\nwere very much relished, for he possessed a natural power of relating\r\nwhat he knew in an interesting manner and with a peculiarly pleasant\r\ntone of voice.  Every one who has considered the subject at all must\r\nhave observed what a powerful influence there lies in the mere manner\r\nand tone of a speaker.  The captain's voice was so rich, so mellow, and\r\ncapable of such varied modulation, that the men listened with pleasure\r\nto the words which rolled from his lips, as one would listen to a sweet\r\nsong.  He became so deeply interested, too, in the subject about which\r\nhe happened to be speaking, that his auditors could not help becoming\r\ninterested also.  He had no powers of eloquence, neither was he gifted\r\nwith an unusually bright fancy.  But he was fluent in speech, and his\r\nwords, though not chosen, were usually appropriate.  The captain had no\r\npowers of invention whatever.  He used to say, when asked to tell a\r\nstory, that he \"might as well try to play the fiddle with a handspike.\"\r\nBut this was no misfortune, for he had read much, and his memory was\r\ngood, and supplied him with an endless flow of small-talk on almost\r\nevery subject that usually falls under the observation of sea-captains,\r\nand on many subjects besides, about which most sea-captains, or\r\nland-captains, or any other captains whatsoever, are almost totally\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning could tell of adventures in the whale-fishery, gone\r\nthrough either by himself or by friends, that would have made your two\r\neyes stare out of their two sockets until they looked like saucers (to\r\nuse a common but not very correct simile).  He could tell the exact\r\nlatitude and longitude of almost every important and prominent part of\r\nthe globe, and give the distance, pretty nearly, of any one place (on a\r\nlarge scale) from any other place.  He could give the heights of all the\r\nchief mountains in the world to within a few feet, and could calculate,\r\nby merely looking at its current and depth, how many cubic feet of water\r\nany river delivered to the sea per minute.  Length, breadth, and\r\nthickness, height, depth, and density, were subjects in which he\r\nrevelled, and with which he played as a juggler does with golden balls;\r\nand so great were his powers of numerical calculation, that the sailors\r\noften declared they believed he could work out any calculation backwards\r\nwithout the use of logarithms!  He was constantly instituting\r\ncomparisons that were by no means what the proverb terms \"odious,\" but\r\nwhich were often very astonishing, and in all his stories so many\r\ncurious and peculiar facts were introduced, that, as we have already\r\nsaid, they were very much relished indeed.\r\n\r\nNot less relished, however, were Glynn Proctor's astounding and purely\r\nimaginative tales.  After the men's minds had been chained intently on\r\none of the captain's semi-philosophical anecdotes, they turned with\r\ninfinite zest to one of Glynn's outrageous flights.  Glynn had not read\r\nmuch in his short life, and his memory was nothing to boast of, but his\r\nimagination was quite gigantic.  He could invent almost anything; and\r\nthe curious part of it was, that he could do it out of nothing, if need\r\nbe.  He never took time to consider what he should say.  When called on\r\nfor a story he began at once, and it flowed from him like a flood of\r\nsparkling water from a fountain in fairy realms.  Up in the clouds; high\r\nin the blue ether; down in the coral caves; deep in the ocean waves; out\r\non the mountain heaths; far in the rocky glens, or away in the wild\r\nwoods green--it was all one to Glynn; he leaped away in an instant, with\r\na long train of adventurers at his heels--male and female, little and\r\nbig, old and young, pretty and plain, grave and gay.  And didn't they go\r\nthrough adventures that would have made the hair of mortals not only\r\nstand on end, but fly out by the roots altogether?  Didn't he make them\r\ntalk, as mortals never talked before; and sing as mortals never dreamed\r\nof?  And, oh! didn't he just make them stew, and roast, and boil joints\r\nof savoury meat, and bake pies, and tarts, and puddings, such as Soyer\r\nin his wildest culinary dreams never imagined, and such as caused the\r\nmouths of the crew of the _Maid of the Isle_ to water, until they were\r\nconstrained, poor fellows, to tell him to \"clap a stopper upon that,\"\r\nand hold his tongue, for they \"couldn't stand it!\"\r\n\r\nPhil Briant and Gurney dealt in the purely comic line.  They remarked--\r\ngenerally in an undertone--that they left poetry and prose to Glynn and\r\nthe captain; and it was as well they did, for their talents certainly\r\ndid not lie in either of these directions.  They came out strong after\r\nmeals, when the weather was fine, and formed a species of light and\r\nagreeable interlude to the more weighty efforts of the captain and the\r\nbrilliant sallies of Glynn.\r\n\r\nGurney dealt in _experiences_ chiefly, and usually endeavoured by\r\nasseveration and iteration to impress his hearers with the truth of\r\nfacts said to have been experienced by himself, which, if true, would\r\ncertainly have consigned him to a premature grave long ago.  Briant, on\r\nthe other hand, dealt largely in ghost stories, which he did not vouch\r\nfor the truth of, but permitted his hearers to judge of for themselves--\r\na permission which they would doubtless have taken for themselves at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nBut tales and stories occupied, after all, only a small portion of the\r\nmen's time during that long voyage.  Often, very often, they were too\r\nmuch exhausted to talk or even to listen, and when not obliged to labour\r\nat the oars they tried to sleep; but \"Nature's sweet restorer\" did not\r\nalways come at the first invitation, as was his wont in other days, and\r\ntoo frequently they were obliged to resume work unrefreshed.  Their\r\nhands became hard and horny in the palms at last, like a man's heel, and\r\ntheir backs and arms ached from constant work.\r\n\r\nAilie kept in good health, but she, too, began to grow weak from want of\r\nproper nourishment.  She slept better than the men, for the comfortable\r\nsleeping-box that Glynn had constructed for her sheltered her from the\r\nheat, wet, and cold, to which the former were constantly exposed.  She\r\namused herself, when not listening to stories or asleep, by playing with\r\nher favourite, and she spent a good deal of time in reading her Bible--\r\nsometimes to herself, at other times, in a low tone, to her father as he\r\nsat at the helm.  And many a time did she see a meaning in passages\r\nwhich, in happier times, had passed meaningless before her eyes, and\r\noften did she find sweet comfort in words that she had read with\r\ncomparative indifference in former days.\r\n\r\nIt is in the time of trial, trouble, and sorrow that the Bible proves to\r\nbe a friend indeed.  Happy the Christian who, when dark clouds overwhelm\r\nhis soul, has a memory well stored with the comforting passages of the\r\nWord of God.\r\n\r\nBut Ailie had another occupation which filled up much of her leisure,\r\nand proved to be a source of deep and engrossing interest at the time.\r\nThis was the keeping of a journal of the voyage.  On the last trip made\r\nto the wreck of the _Red Eric_, just before the great storm that\r\ncompleted the destruction of that ship, the captain had brought away in\r\nhis pocket a couple of note-books.  One of these he kept to himself to\r\njot down the chief incidents of the intended voyage; the other he gave\r\nto Ailie, along with a blacklead pencil.  Being fond of trying to write,\r\nshe amused herself for hours together in jotting down her thoughts about\r\nthe various incidents of the voyage, great and small; and being a very\r\ngood drawer for her age, she executed many fanciful and elaborate\r\nsketches, among which were innumerable portraits of Jacko and several\r\ncaricatures of the men.  This journal, as it advanced, became a source\r\nof much interest and amusement to every one in the boat; and when, in an\r\nhour of the utmost peril, it, along with many other things, was lost,\r\nthe men, after the danger was past, felt the loss severely.\r\n\r\nThus they spent their time--now pleasantly, now sadly--sometimes\r\nbecoming cheerful and hopeful, at other times sinking almost into a\r\nstate of despair as their little stock of food and water dwindled down,\r\nwhile the _Maid of the Isle_ still held on her apparently endless course\r\nover the great wide sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE CALM AND THE STORM--A SERIOUS LOSS AND GREAT GAIN--BIRD-CATCHING\r\nEXTRAORDINARY--SAVED AT LAST.\r\n\r\nOne day a deep death-like calm settled down upon the ocean.  For some\r\ndays before, the winds had been light and uncertain, and the air had\r\nbeen excessively warm.  The captain cast uneasy glances around him from\r\ntime to time, and looked with a sadder countenance than usual on the\r\nhaggard faces of the men as they laboured slowly and silently at the\r\noars.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what this will turn to, doctor,\" he said, in a low tone;\r\n\"I don't like the look of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who was perusing Ailie's journal at the moment, looked up\r\nand shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, captain, that whatever happens, matters cannot be made\r\nmuch worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, doctor,\" replied the captain quietly; \"we have still\r\nmuch to be thankful for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not tell me a few minutes ago that the water was almost done?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor said this in a whisper, for the men had not yet been made\r\naware of the fact.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did; but it is not _quite_ done; that is matter for\r\nthankfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, according to that principle,\" observed the doctor, somewhat\r\ntestily, \"you may say we have cause to be thankful for _everything_, bad\r\nas well as good.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have! so we have!  If everything good were taken from us, and\r\nnothing left us but our lives, we would have reason to be thankful for\r\nthat--thankful that we were still above ground, still in the land of\r\nhope, with salvation to our immortal souls through Jesus Christ freely\r\noffered for our acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor made no reply.  He thought the captain a little weak in the\r\nmatter of religion.  If religion is false, his opinion of the captain no\r\ndoubt, was right, but if true, surely the weakness lay all the other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThat morning the captain's voice in prayer was more earnest, if\r\npossible, than usual, and he put up a special petition for _water_,\r\nwhich was observed by the men with feelings of great anxiety, and\r\nresponded to with a deep amen.  After morning worship the scales were\r\nbrought, and the captain proceeded to weigh out the scanty meal, while\r\nthe men watched his every motion with an almost wolfish glare, that told\r\neloquently of the prolonged sufferings they had endured.  Even poor\r\nAilie's gentle face now wore a sharp, anxious expression when food was\r\nbeing served out, and she accepted her small portion with a nervous\r\nhaste that was deeply painful and touching to witness.  She little knew,\r\npoor child, that that portion of bread and meat and water, small though\r\nit was, was larger than that issued to the men, being increased by a\r\nsmall quantity deducted from the captain's own allowance and an equal\r\namount from that of Glynn.  The latter had noticed the captain's habit\r\nof regularly calling off the child's attention during the distribution\r\nof each meal, for the purpose of thus increasing her portion at the\r\nexpense of his own, and in a whispering conversation held soon after he\r\ninsisted that a little of his allowance should also be transferred to\r\nher.  At first the captain firmly refused, but Glynn said that if he did\r\nnot accede to his wish he would hand over the whole of his portion in\r\nfuture to the monkey, let the result be what it might!  As Glynn never\r\nthreatened without a full and firm resolve to carry out his threats, the\r\ncaptain was compelled to give in.\r\n\r\nWhen the water came to be served out that morning the captain paused,\r\nand looking round at the anxious eyes that were riveted upon him, said--\r\n\r\n\"My lads, it has pleased the Almighty to lay His hand still heavier on\r\nus.  May He who has said that He will not suffer men to be tempted above\r\nwhat they are able to bear, give us strength to stand it.  Our water is\r\nalmost done.  We must be content with a quarter of our usual allowance.\"\r\n\r\nThis information was received in deep silence--perhaps it was the\r\nsilence of despair, for the quantity hitherto served out had been barely\r\nsufficient to moisten their parched throats, and they _knew_ that they\r\ncould not exist long on the reduced allowance.\r\n\r\nJacko came with the rest as usual for his share, and held out his little\r\nhand for the tin cup in which his few drops of water were wont to be\r\nhanded to him.  The captain hesitated and looked at the men; then he\r\npoured out a few drops of the precious liquid.  For the first time a\r\nmurmur of disapproval was heard.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a brute beast; the monkey must die before _us_,\" said a voice\r\nwhich was so hollow and changed that it could scarcely be recognised as\r\nthat of Tarquin, the steward.\r\n\r\nNo one else said a word.  The captain did not even look up to see who\r\nhad spoken.  He felt the justice as well as the harshness of the remark,\r\nand poured the water back into the jar.\r\n\r\nJacko seems puzzled at first, and held out his hand again; then he\r\nlooked round on the men with that expression of unutterable woe which is\r\npeculiar to some species of the monkey tribe.  He seemed to feel that\r\nsomething serious was about to happen to him.  Looking up in the sad\r\nface of his young mistress, he uttered a very gentle and plaintive\r\n\"oo-oo-ee!\"\r\n\r\nAilie burst into a passionate flood of tears, and in the impulse of the\r\nmoment handed her own cup, which she had not tasted, to Jacko, who\r\ndrained it in a twinkling--before the captain could snatch it from his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHaving emptied it, Jacko went forward as he had been taught to do, and\r\nhanded back the cup with quite a pleased expression of countenance--for\r\nhe was easily satisfied, poor thing!\r\n\r\n\"You should not have done that, my darling,\" said the captain, as he\r\ngave Ailie another portion.\r\n\r\n\"Dear papa, I couldn't help it,\" sobbed the child; \"indeed I couldn't--\r\nand you need not give me any.  I can do without it to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you?  But you shan't,\" exclaimed Glynn, with a degree of energy\r\nthat would have made every one laugh in happier times.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my own pet,\" replied the captain.  \"You shan't want it.  Here,\r\nyou _must_ drink it, come.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day Jacko received his allowance regularly as long as a drop\r\nof water was left, and no one again murmured against it.  When it was\r\nfinished he had to suffer with the rest.\r\n\r\nThe calm which had set in proved to be of longer duration than usual,\r\nand the sufferings of the crew of the little boat became extreme.  On\r\nthe third day after its commencement the last drop of water was served\r\nout.  It amounted to a couple of teaspoonfuls per man each meal, of\r\nwhich there were three a day.  During the continuance of the calm, the\r\nsun shone in an almost cloudless sky and beat down upon the heads of the\r\nmen until it drove them nearly mad.  They all looked like living\r\nskeletons, and their eyes glared from their sunken sockets with a dry\r\nfiery lustre that was absolutely terrible to behold.  Had each one in\r\nthat boat possessed millions of gold he would have given all, gladly,\r\nfor one drop of fresh water; but, alas! nothing could purchase water\r\nthere.  Ailie thought upon the man who, in the Bible, is described as\r\nlooking up to heaven from the depths of hell and crying for one drop of\r\nwater to cool his tongue, and she fancied that she could now realise his\r\nagony.  The captain looked up into the hot sky, but no blessed cloud\r\nappeared there to raise the shadow of a hope.  He looked down at the\r\nsea, and it seemed to mock him with its clear blue depths, which looked\r\nso sweet and pleasant.  He realised the full significance of that\r\ncouplet in Coleridge's _Ancient Mariner_--\r\n\r\n  \"Water, water, everywhere,\r\n  But not a drop to drink.\"\r\n\r\nand, drawing Ailie to his breast, he laid his cheek upon hers and\r\ngroaned aloud.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon be taken away, dear papa!\" she said--and she tried to\r\nweep, but the tears that came unbidden and so easily at other times to\r\nher bright blue eyes refused to flow now.\r\n\r\nThe men had one by one ceased to ply their useless oars, and the captain\r\ndid not take notice of it, for he felt that unless God sent relief in\r\nsome almost miraculous way, their continuing to row would be of no\r\navail.  It would only increase their agony without advancing them more\r\nthan a few miles on the long, long voyage that he knew still lay before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"O God, grant us a breeze!\" cried Mr Millons, in a deep, tremulous tone\r\nbreaking a silence that had continued for some hours.\r\n\r\n\"Messmates,\" said Tim Rokens, who for some time had leaned with both\r\nelbows on his oar and his face buried in his hands, \"wot d'ye say to a\r\nbath?  I do believe it 'ud do us good.\"\r\n\r\n\"P'haps it would,\" replied King Bumble; but he did not move, and the\r\nother men made no reply, while Rokens again sank forward.\r\n\r\nGurney and Tarquin had tried to relieve their thirst the day before by\r\ndrinking sea-water, but their inflamed and swollen throats and lips now\r\nshowed that the relief sought had not been obtained.\r\n\r\n\"It's time for supper,\" said the captain, raising his head suddenly, and\r\nlaying Ailie down, for she had fallen into a lethargic slumber; \"fetch\r\nme the bread and meat can.\"\r\n\r\nDick Barnes obeyed reluctantly, and the usual small allowance of salt\r\njunk was weighed out, but there were no eager glances now.  Most of the\r\ncrew refused to touch food--one or two tried to eat a morsel of biscuit\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try a swim,\" cried Glynn, suddenly starting up with the intention\r\nof leaping overboard.  But his strength was more exhausted than he had\r\nfancied, for he only fell against the side of the boat.  It was as well\r\nthat he failed.  Had he succeeded in getting into the water he could not\r\nhave clambered in again, and it is doubtful whether his comrades had\r\nsufficient strength left to have dragged him in.\r\n\r\n\"Try it this way, lad,\" said Tim Rokens, taking up a bucket, and dipping\r\nit over the side.  \"P'raps it'll do as well.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised the bucket with some difficulty and poured its contents over\r\nGlynn's head.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Glynn, with a deep, long-drawn sigh.  \"Do it again,\r\nTim, do it again.  That's it,--again, again!  No, stop; forgive my\r\nselfishness; here, give me the bucket, I'll do it to you now.\"\r\n\r\nTim Rokens was quickly drenched from head to foot, and felt great and\r\ninstantaneous relief.  In a few minutes every one in the boat, Jacko\r\nincluded, was subjected to this species of cold bath, and their spirits\r\nrose at once.  Some of them even began to eat their food, and Briant\r\nactually attempted to perpetrate a joke, which Gurney seconded promptly,\r\nbut they failed to make one, even a bad one, between them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cold bathing seemed good for them at first, it soon proved\r\nto be hurtful.  Sitting and lying constantly night and day in saturated\r\nclothes had the effect of rendering their skins painfully sensitive, and\r\na feverish feeling was often alternated with cold shivering fits, so\r\nthey were fain to give it up.  Still they had found some slight relief,\r\nand they bore their sufferings with calm resignation--a state of mind\r\nwhich was fostered, if not induced, by the blessed words of comfort and\r\nhope which the captain read to them from the Bible as frequently as his\r\nstrength would permit, and to which they listened with intense,\r\nall-absorbing interest.\r\n\r\nIt is ever thus with men.  When death approaches, in almost all\r\ninstances, we are ready--ay, anxious--to listen with the deepest\r\ninterest to God's message of salvation through His Son, and to welcome\r\nand long for the influences of the Holy Spirit.  Oh! how happy should we\r\nbe in life and in death, did we only give heartfelt interest to our\r\nsouls' affairs _before_ the days of sorrow and death arrive.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth morning after the water had been exhausted the sun arose in\r\nthe midst of dark clouds.  The men could scarcely believe their eyes.\r\nThey shouted and, in their weakness, laughed for joy.\r\n\r\nThe blessing was not long delayed.  Thick vapours veiled the red sun\r\nsoon after it emerged from the sea, then a few drops of rain fell.\r\nBlessed drops!  How the men caught at them!  How they spread out oiled\r\ncloths and tarpaulins and garments to gather them!  How they grudged to\r\nsee them falling around the boat into the sea, and being lost to them\r\nfor ever.  But the blessing was soon sent liberally.  The heavens above\r\ngrew black, and the rain came down in thick heavy showers.  The\r\ntarpaulins were quickly filled, and the men lay with their lips to the\r\nsweet pools, drinking-in new life, and dipping their heads and hands in\r\nthe cool liquid when they could drink no more.  Their thirst was slaked\r\nat last, and they were happy.  All their past sufferings were forgotten\r\nin that great hour of relief, and they looked, and laughed, and spoke to\r\neach other like men who were saved from death.  As they stripped off\r\ntheir garments and washed the encrusted salt from their shrunken limbs,\r\nall of them doubtless felt, and some of them audibly expressed,\r\ngratitude to the \"Giver of every good and perfect gift.\"\r\n\r\nSo glad were they, and so absorbed in their occupation, that they\r\nthought not of and cared not for the fact that a great storm was about\r\nto break upon them.  It came upon them almost before they were aware,\r\nand before the sails could be taken in the boat was almost upset.\r\n\r\n\"Stand-by to lower the sails!\" shouted the captain, who was the first to\r\nsee their danger.\r\n\r\nThe old familiar command issued with something of the old familiar voice\r\nand energy caused every one to leap to his post, if not with the agility\r\nof former times, at least with all the good will.\r\n\r\n\"Let go!\"\r\n\r\nThe halyards were loosed, and the sails came tumbling down; at the same\r\nmoment the squall burst on them.  The _Maid of the Isle_ bent over so\r\nquickly that every one expected she would upset; the blue water curled\r\nin over the edge of the gunwale, and the foam burst from her bows at the\r\nrude shock.  Then she hissed through the water as she answered the helm,\r\nrighted quickly, and went tearing away before the wind at a speed that\r\nshe had not known for many days.  It was a narrow escape.  The boat was\r\nnearly filled with water, and, worst of all, the provision can, along\r\nwith Ailie's sleeping-box, were washed overboard and lost.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use attempting to recover them.  All the energies of the\r\ncrew were required to bale out the water and keep the boat afloat, and\r\nduring the whole storm some of them were constantly employed in baling.\r\nFor three days it blew a perfect hurricane, and during all that time the\r\nmen had nothing whatever to eat; but they did not suffer so much as\r\nmight be supposed.  The gnawing pangs of hunger do not usually last\r\nbeyond a few days when men are starving.  After that they merely feel\r\never-increasing weakness.  During the fall of the rain they had taken\r\ncare to fill their jars, so that they had now a good supply of water.\r\n\r\nAfter the first burst of the squall had passed, the tarpaulins were\r\nspread over the boat, and under one of these, near the stern, Ailie was\r\nplaced, and was comparatively sheltered and comfortable.  Besides\r\nforming a shelter for the men while they slept, these tarpaulins threw\r\noff the waves that frequently broke over the boat, and more than once\r\nbid fair to sink her altogether.  These arose in enormous billows, and\r\nthe gale was so violent that only the smallest corner of the foresail\r\ncould be raised--even that was almost sufficient to tear away the mast.\r\n\r\nAt length the gale blew itself out, and gradually decreased to a\r\nmoderate breeze, before which the sails were shaken out, and on the\r\nfourth morning after it broke they found themselves sweeping quickly\r\nover the waves on their homeward way, but without a morsel of food, and\r\nthoroughly exhausted in body and in mind.\r\n\r\nOn that morning, however, they passed a piece of floating seaweed, a\r\nsure indication of their approach to land.  Captain Dunning pointed it\r\nout to Ailie and the crew with a cheering remark that they would\r\nprobably soon get to the end of their voyage; but he did not feel much\r\nhope; for, without food, they could not exist above a few days more at\r\nthe furthest--perhaps not so long.  That same evening, several small\r\nsea-birds came towards the boat, and flew inquiringly round it, as if\r\nthey wondered what it could be doing there, so far away from the haunts\r\nof men.  These birds were evidently unaccustomed to man, for they\r\nexhibited little fear.  They came so near to the boat that one of them\r\nwas at length caught.  It was the negro who succeeded in knocking it on\r\nthe head with a boat-hook as it flew past.\r\n\r\nGreat was the praise bestowed on King Bumble for this meritorious deed,\r\nand loud were the praises bestowed on the bird itself, which was\r\ncarefully divided into equal portions (and a small portion for Jacko),\r\nand eaten raw.  Not a morsel of it was lost--claws, beak, blood, bones,\r\nand feathers--all were eaten up.  In order to prevent dispute or\r\njealousy, the captain made Ailie turn her back on the bird when thus\r\ndivided, and pointing to the different portions, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Who shall have this?\"  Whoever was named by Ailie had to be content\r\nwith what thus fell to his share.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but ye wos always an onlucky dog!\" exclaimed Briant, to whom fell\r\nthe head and claws.\r\n\r\n\"Ye've no reason to grumble,\" replied Gurney; \"ye've got all the brains\r\nto yerself, and no one needs them more.\"\r\n\r\nThe catching of this bird was the saving of the crew, and it afforded\r\nthem a good deal of mirth in the dividing of it.  The heart and a small\r\npart of the breast fell to Ailie--which every one remarked was\r\nsingularly appropriate; part of a leg and the tail fell to King Bumble;\r\nand the lungs and stomach became the property of Jim Scroggles,\r\nwhereupon Briant remarked that he would \"think as much almost o' _that_\r\nstomach as he had iver done of his own!\"  But there was much of sadness\r\nmingled with their mirth, for they felt that the repast was a peculiarly\r\nlight one, and they had scarcely strength left to laugh or jest.\r\n\r\nNext morning they knocked down another bird, and in the evening they got\r\ntwo more.  The day after that they captured an albatross, which\r\nfurnished them at last with an ample supply of fresh food.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Markham, the second mate, who first saw the great bird\r\nlooming in the distance, as it sailed over the sea towards them.\r\n\r\n\"Let's try to fish for him,\" said the doctor.  \"I've heard of sea-birds\r\nbeing caught in that way before now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish for it!\" exclaimed Ailie in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, with hook and line, Ailie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen it done often,\" said the captain.  \"Hand me the line, Bumble,\r\nand a bit o' that bird we got yesterday.  Now for it.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the hook was baited, the albatross had approached near to\r\nthe boat, and hovered around it with that curiosity which seems to be a\r\ncharacteristic feature of all sea-birds.  It was an enormous creature;\r\nbut Ailie, when she saw it in the air, could not have believed it\r\npossible that it was so large as it was afterwards found to be on being\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Glynn, catch hold of the line,\" said the captain, as he threw the\r\nhook overboard, and allowed it to trail astern; \"you are the strongest\r\nman amongst us now, I think; starvation don't seem to tell so much on\r\nyour young flesh and bones as on ours!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it seems to agree with his constitution,\" remarked Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"It's me that wouldn't give much for his flesh,\" observed Briant; \"but\r\nhis skin and bones would fetch a good price in the leather and rag\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\nWhile his messmates were thus freely remarking on his personal\r\nappearance--which, to say truth, was dreadfully haggard--Glynn was\r\nholding the end of the line, and watching the motions of the albatross\r\nwith intense interest.\r\n\r\n\"He won't take it,\" observed the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Me tink him will,\" said Bumble.\r\n\r\n\"No go,\" remarked Nikel Sling sadly.\r\n\r\n\"That was near,\" said the first mate eagerly, as the bird made a bold\r\nswoop down towards the bait, which was skipping over the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"No, he's off,\" cried Mr Markham in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Cotched! or I'm a Dutchman!\" shouted.  Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried Jim Scroggles.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" screamed Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Tim Rokens and Tarquin in a breath.\r\n\r\nDick Barnes, and the doctor, and the captain, and, in short, everybody,\r\nechoed the last sentiment, and repeated it again and again with delight\r\nas they saw the gigantic bird once again swoop down upon the bait and\r\nseize it.\r\n\r\nGlynn gave a jerk, the hook caught in its tongue, and the albatross\r\nbegan to tug, and swoop, and whirl madly in its effort to escape.\r\n\r\nNow, to talk of any ordinary bird swooping, and fluttering, and tugging,\r\ndoes not sound very tremendous; but, reader, had you witnessed the\r\nmanner in which that enormous albatross conducted itself, you wouldn't\r\nhave stared with amazement--oh, no!  You wouldn't have gone home with\r\nyour mouth as wide open as your eyes, and have given a gasping account\r\nof what you had seen--by no means!  You wouldn't have talked of\r\nfeathered steam-engines, or of fabled rocs, or of winged elephants in\r\nthe air--certainly not!\r\n\r\nGlynn's arms jerked as if he were holding on to the sheet of a shifting\r\nmainsail of a seventy-four.\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand,\" he cried, \"else I'll be torn to bits.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral hands grasped the line in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"My! wot a wopper,\" exclaimed Tim Rokens.\r\n\r\n\"Och! don't he pull?  Wot a fortin he'd make av he'd only set his-self\r\nup as a tug-boat in the Thames!\"\r\n\r\n\"If only we had him at the oar for a week,\" added Gurney.\r\n\r\n\"Hoich! doctor, have ye strength to set disjointed limbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, lads,\" cried the captain, in some anxiety; \"give him more\r\nplay, the line won't stand it.  Time enough to jest after we've got\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe bird was now swooping, and waving, and beating its great wings so\r\nclose to the boat that they began to entertain some apprehension lest\r\nany of the crew should be disabled by a stroke from them before the bird\r\ncould be secured.  Glynn, therefore, left the management of the line to\r\nothers, and, taking up an oar, tried to strike it.  But he failed in\r\nseveral attempts.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we haul him nearer, boy,\" said the captain.  \"Now, then!\"\r\n\r\nGlynn struck again, and succeeded in hitting it a slight blow.  At the\r\nsame instant the albatross swept over the boat, and almost knocked the\r\ndoctor overboard.  As it brushed past, King Bumble, who was gifted with\r\nthe agility of a monkey, leaped up, caught it round the neck, and the\r\nnext moment the two were rolling together in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe creature was soon strangled, and a mighty cheer greeted this\r\nmomentous victory.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that albatross flesh is generally considered very\r\ndesirable food, but we are certain that starving men are particularly\r\nglad to get it, and that the supply now obtained by the wrecked mariners\r\nwas the means of preserving their lives until they reached the land,\r\nwhich they did ten days afterwards, having thus accomplished a voyage of\r\nabove two thousand miles over the ocean in an open boat in the course of\r\neight weeks, and on an amount of food that was barely sufficient for one\r\nor two weeks' ordinary consumption.\r\n\r\nGreat commiseration was expressed for them by the people at the Cape,\r\nwho vied with each other in providing for their wants, and in showing\r\nthem kindness.\r\n\r\nAilie and her father were carried off bodily by a stout old merchant,\r\nwith a broad kind face, and a hearty, boisterous manner, and lodged in\r\nhis elegant villa during their stay in that quarter of the world, which\r\nwas protracted some time in order that they might recruit the wasted\r\nstrength of the party ere they commenced their voyage home in a vessel\r\nbelonging to the same stout, broad-faced, and vociferous merchant.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several other ships departed for America, and by one of these\r\nCaptain Dunning wrote to his sisters Martha and Jane.  The captain never\r\nwrote to Martha or to Jane separately--he always wrote to them\r\nconjointly as \"Martha Jane Dunning.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was a peculiar letter-writer.  Those who may feel curious to\r\nknow more about this matter are referred for further information to the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nHOME, SWEET HOME--THE CAPTAIN TAKES HIS SISTERS BY SURPRISE--A\r\nMYSTERIOUS STRANGER.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact which we cannot deny, however much we may feel disposed to\r\nmarvel at it, that laughter and weeping, at one and the same time, are\r\ncompatible.  The most resolute sceptic on this point would have been\r\nconvinced of the truth of it had he been introduced into the Misses\r\nMartha and Jane Dunning's parlour on the beautiful summer morning in\r\nwhich the remarkable events we are about to relate occurred.\r\n\r\nOn the morning in question, a letter-carrier walked up to the cottage\r\nwith the yellow-painted face, and with the green door, so like a nose in\r\nthe middle; and the window on each side thereof, so like its eyes; and\r\nthe green Venetian blinds, that served so admirably for eyelids,\r\nattached thereto--all of which stood, and beamed, and luxuriated, and\r\nvegetated, and grew old in the centre of the town on the eastern\r\nseaboard of America, whose name (for strictly private reasons) we have\r\nfirmly declined, and do still positively refuse to communicate.\r\n\r\nHaving walked up to the cottage, the letter-carrier hit it a severe\r\nsmash on its green nose, as good Captain Dunning had done many, many\r\nmonths before.  The result now, as then, was the opening thereof by a\r\nservant-girl--the servant-girl of old.  The letter-carrier was a\r\ntaciturn man; he said nothing, but handed in the letter, and went his\r\nway.  The servant-girl was a morose damsel; she said nothing, but took\r\nthe letter, shut the door, and laid it (the letter, not the door) on the\r\nbreakfast-table, and went her way--which way was the way of all flesh,\r\nfish, and fowl--namely, the kitchen, where breakfast was being prepared.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the letter Miss Jane Dunning--having put on an\r\nimmaculately clean white collar and a spotlessly beautiful white cap\r\nwith pink ribbons, which looked, if possible, taller than usual--\r\ndescended to the breakfast-parlour.  Her eye instantly fell on the\r\nletter, and she exclaimed--\"Oh!\" at the full pitch of her voice.\r\nIndeed, did not respect for the good lady forbid, we would say that she\r\n_yelled_ \"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly, as if by magic, a faint \"oh!\" came down-stairs like an echo,\r\nfrom the region of Miss Martha Dunning's bedroom, and was followed up by\r\na \"What is it?\" so loud that the most unimaginative person could not\r\nhave failed to perceive that the elder sister had opened her door and\r\nput her head over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" repeated Miss Martha.\r\n\r\n\"A letter!\" answered Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Who from?\"  (in eager surprise, from above.)\r\n\r\n\"Brother George!\"  (in eager delight, from below.)\r\n\r\nMiss Jane had not come to this knowledge because of having read the\r\nletter, for it still lay on the table unopened, but because she could\r\nnot read it at all!  One of Captain Dunning's peculiarities was that he\r\nwrote an execrably bad and illegible hand.  His English was good, his\r\nspelling pretty fair, considering the absurd nature of the orthography\r\nof his native tongue, and his sense was excellent, but the whole was\r\nusually shrouded in hieroglyphical mystery.  Miss Jane could only read\r\nthe opening \"My dearest Sisters,\" and the concluding \"George Dunning,\"\r\nnothing more.  But Miss Martha could, by the exercise of some rare\r\npower, spell out her brother's hand, though not without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming,\" shouted Miss Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Be quick!\" screamed Miss Jane.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds Miss Martha entered the room with her cap and collar,\r\nthough faultlessly clean and stiff, put on very much awry.\r\n\r\n\"Give it me!  Where is it?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jane pointed to the letter, still remaining transfixed to the spot\r\nwhere her eye had first met it, as if it were some dangerous animal\r\nwhich would bite if she touched it.\r\n\r\nMiss Martha snatched it up, tore it open, and flopped down on the sofa.\r\nMiss Jane snatched up an imaginary letter, tore it open (in\r\nimagination), and flopping down beside her sister, looked over her\r\nshoulder, apparently to make believe to herself that she read it along\r\nwith her.  Thus they read and commented on the captain's letter in\r\nconcert.\r\n\r\n\"`Table Bay'--dear me! what a funny bay that must be--`My dearest\r\nSisters'--the darling fellow, he always begins that way, don't he, Jane\r\ndear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless him! he does, Martha dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"`We've been all'--I can't make this word out, can you, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, love.\"\r\n\r\n\"`We've been all-worked!'  No, it can't be that.  Stay, `We've been all\r\n_wrecked_!'\"\r\n\r\nHere Martha laid down the letter with a look of horror, and Jane, with a\r\nface of ashy paleness, exclaimed, \"Then they're lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"But no,\" cried Martha, \"George could not have written to us from\r\nTablecloth Bay had he been lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither he could!\" exclaimed Jane, eagerly.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the revulsion of feeling this caused, Martha\r\nburst into tears and Jane into laughter.  Immediately after, Jane wept\r\nand Martha laughed; then they both laughed and cried together, after\r\nwhich they felt for their pocket-handkerchiefs, and discovered that in\r\ntheir haste they had forgotten them; so they had to call the\r\nservant-girl and send her up-stairs for them; and when the handkerchiefs\r\nwere brought, they had to be unfolded before the sisters could dry their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWhen they had done so, and were somewhat composed, they went on with the\r\nreading of the letter.\r\n\r\n\"`We've been all wrecked'--Dreadful--`and the poor _Red Angel_'\"--\"Oh!\r\nit can't be that, Martha dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it looks very like it, Jane darling.  Oh!  I see; it's\r\n_Eric_--`and the poor _Red Eric_ has been patched,' or--`pitched on a\r\nrock and smashed to sticks and stivers'--Dear me! what can that be?  I\r\nknow what `sticks' are, but I can't imagine what `stivers' mean.  Can\r\nyou, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't the remotest idea; perhaps Johnson, or Walker, or Webster may--\r\nyes, Webster is sure to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! never mind just now, dear Jane, we can look it up\r\nafterwards--`stivers--sticks and stivers'--something very dreadful, I\r\nfear.  `But we're all safe and well now'--I'm _so_ thankful!--`and we've\r\nbeen stumped'--No `starved nearly to death, too.  My poor Ailie was\r\nthinner than ever I saw her before'--This is horrible, dear Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreadful, darling Martha.\"\r\n\r\n\"`But she's milk and butter'--It can't be that--`milk and'--oh!--`much\r\nbetter now.'\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Martha laid down the letter, and the two sisters wept for\r\na few seconds in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Darling Ailie!\" said Martha, drying her eyes, \"how thin she must have\r\nbeen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes, and no one to take in her frocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"`We'll be home in less than no time,'\" continued Martha, reading, \"`so\r\nyou may get ready for us.  Glynn will have tremendous long yarns to spin\r\nto you when we come back, and so will Ailie.  She has seen a Lotofun\r\nsince we left you'--Bless me! what _can_ that be, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely some terrible sea monster, Martha; how thankful we ought to\r\nbe that it did not eat her!--`seen a Lotofun'--strange!--`a Lot--o''--\r\nOh!--`_lot o' fun_!'--that's it! how stupid of me!--`and my dear pet has\r\nbeen such an ass'--Eh! for shame, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, dear, Martha, that there's some more of that word on\r\nthe next line?\"\r\n\r\n\"So there is, I'm _so_ stupid--`istance'--It's not rightly divided\r\nthough--`as-sistance and a comfort to me.'  I knew it couldn't be ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I.  Ailie an ass! precious child!\"\r\n\r\n\"`Now, good-bye t'ye, my dear lassies,'\r\n\r\n\"`Ever your affectionate brother,'\r\n\r\n\"(Dear Fellow!)\r\n\r\n\"`GEORGE DUNNING.'\"\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that the ship which conveyed the above letter across the\r\nAtlantic was a slow sailer and was much delayed by contrary winds.  And\r\nit also chanced--for odd coincidences do happen occasionally in human\r\naffairs--that the vessel in which Captain Dunning with Ailie and his\r\ncrew embarked some weeks later was a fast-sailing ship, and was blown\r\nacross the sea with strong favouring gales.  Hence it fell out that the\r\nfirst vessel entered port on Sunday night, and the second cast anchor in\r\nthe same port on Monday morning.\r\n\r\nThe green-painted door, therefore, of the yellow-faced cottage, had\r\nscarcely recovered from the assault of the letter-carrier, when it was\r\nagain struck violently by the impatient Captain Dunning.\r\n\r\nMiss Martha, who had just concluded and refolded the letter, screamed\r\n\"Oh!\" and leaped up.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane did the same, with this difference, that she leaped up before\r\nscreaming \"Oh!\" instead of after doing so.  Then both ladies, hearing\r\nvoices outside, rushed towards the door of the parlour with the\r\nintention of flying to their rooms and there carefully arranging their\r\ntall white caps and clean white collars, and keeping the early visitor,\r\nwhoever he or she might be, waiting fully a quarter of an hour or twenty\r\nminutes, before they should descend, stiffly, starchly, and\r\nceremoniously, to receive him--or her.\r\n\r\nThese intentions were frustrated by the servant-girl, who opened the\r\ngreen-painted door and let in the captain, who rushed into the parlour\r\nand rudely kissed his speechless sisters.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be?\" gasped Martha.\r\n\r\nJane had meant to gasp \"Impossible!\" but seeing Ailie at that moment\r\nbound into Martha's arms, she changed her intention, uttered a loud\r\nscream instead, and fell down flat upon the floor under the impression\r\nthat she had fainted.  Finding, however, that this was not the case, she\r\ngot up again quickly--ignorant of the fact that the tall cap had come\r\noff altogether in the fall--and stood before her sister weeping, and\r\nlaughing, and wringing her hands, and waiting for her turn.\r\n\r\nBut it did not seem likely to come soon, for Martha continued to hug\r\nAilie, whom she had raised entirely from the ground, with passionate\r\nfervour.  Seeing this, and feeling that to wait was impossible, Jane\r\ndarted forward, threw her arms round Ailie--including Martha, as an\r\nunavoidable consequence--and pressed the child's back to her throbbing\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nBetween the two poor Ailie was nearly suffocated.  Indeed, she was\r\ncompelled to scream, not because she wished to, but because Martha and\r\nJane squeezed a scream out of her.  The scream acted on the former as a\r\nreproof.  She resigned Ailie to Jane, flung herself recklessly on the\r\nsofa, and kicked.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Captain Dunning stood looking on, rubbing his hands,--\r\nslapping his thighs, and blowing his nose.  The servant-girl also stood\r\nlooking on doing nothing--her face was a perfect blaze of amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Girl,\" said the captain, turning suddenly towards her, \"is breakfast\r\nready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" gasped the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Then fetch it.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl did not move.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye hear?\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then look alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain followed this up with a roar and such an indescribably\r\nferocious demonstration that the girl fled in terror to the culinary\r\nregions, where she found the cat breakfasting on a pat of butter.  The\r\ngirl yelled, and flung first a saucepan, and after that the lid of a\r\nteapot, at the thief.  She failed, of course, in this effort to commit\r\nmurder, and the cat vanished.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was brought, but, excepting in the captain's case, breakfast\r\nwas not eaten.  What between questioning, and crying, and hysterical\r\nlaughing, and replying, and gasping, explaining, misunderstanding,\r\nexclaiming, and choking, the other members of the party that breakfasted\r\nthat morning in the yellow cottage with the much-abused green door, did\r\nlittle else than upset tea-cups and cream-pots, and sputter eggs about,\r\nand otherwise make a mess of the once immaculate tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Aunt Martha!\" exclaimed Ailie, in the midst of a short pause in the\r\nstorm, \"I'm _so_ very, very, _very_ glad to be home!\"\r\n\r\nThe child said this with intense fervour.  No one but he who has been\r\nlong, long away from the home of his childhood, and had come back after\r\nhaving despaired of ever seeing it again, can imagine with what deep\r\nfervour she said it, and then burst into tears.\r\n\r\nAunt Jane at that moment was venturing to swallow her first mouthful of\r\ntea, so she gulped and choked, and Aunt Martha spent the next five\r\nminutes in violently beating the poor creature's back, as if she deemed\r\nchoking a serious offence which merited severe punishment.  As for the\r\ncaptain, that unfeeling monster went on grinning from ear to ear, and\r\neating a heavy breakfast, as if nothing had happened.  But a close\r\nobserver might have noticed a curious process going on at the starboard\r\nside of his weather-beaten nose.\r\n\r\nIn one of his many desperate encounters with whales, Captain Dunning had\r\nhad the end of a harpoon thrust accidentally into the prominent member\r\nof his face just above the bridge.  A permanent little hole was the\r\nresult, and on the morning of which we write, a drop of water got into\r\nthat hole continually, and when it rolled out--which it did about once\r\nevery two minutes--and fell into the captain's tea-cup, it was speedily\r\nreplaced by another drop, which trickled into the depths of that small\r\ncavern on the starboard side of the captain's nose.  We don't pretend to\r\naccount for that curious phenomenon.  We merely record the fact.\r\n\r\nWhile the breakfast party were yet in this April mood, a knock was heard\r\nat the outer door.\r\n\r\n\"Visitors!\" said Martha, with a look that would have led a stranger to\r\nsuppose that she held visitors in much the same estimation as\r\ntax-gatherers.\r\n\r\n\"How awkward!\" exclaimed Aunt Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Send 'em away, girl,\" cried the captain.  \"We're all engaged.  Can't\r\nsee any one to-day.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment the servant-girl returned.\r\n\r\n\"He says he _must_ see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"See who?\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"See _you_, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must he; then he shan't.  Tell him that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, he says he won't go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't he?\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this the captain set his teeth, clenched his fists, and\r\ndarted out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  George!  Stop him! do stop him.  He's _so_ violent!  He'll do\r\nsomething dreadful!\" said Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Will no one call out murder?\" groaned Aunt Jane, with a shudder.\r\n\r\nAs no one, however, ventured to check Captain Dunning, he reached the\r\ndoor, and confronted a rough, big, burly sailor, who stood outside with\r\na free-and-easy expression of countenance, and his hands in his trousers\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go away when you're told, eh?\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I won't,\" answered the man coolly.\r\n\r\nThe captain stepped close up, but the sailor stood his ground and\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my lad, if you don't up anchor and make sail right away, I'll\r\nknock in your daylights.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't do nothin' o' the kind, old gen'lem'n; but you'll\r\ndouble-reef your temper, and listen to wot I've got to say; for it's\r\nvery partikler, an' won't keep long without spilin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you got to say, then?\" said the captain, becoming interested,\r\nbut still feeling nettled at the interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; but put on your sky-scraper, and come down with me to the\r\ngrog-shop wot I frequents, and I'll tell ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort; be off,\" cried the captain, preparing to\r\nslam the door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it's all the same to me, in coorse, but I rather think if ye know'd\r\nthat it's 'bout the _Termagant_, and that 'ere whale wot--but it don't\r\nmatter.  Good-mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" cried the captain, as the last words fell on his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Have you really anything to say to me about that ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"In coorse I has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come in and say it here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by no means.  You must come down to the grog-shop with _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the captain ran back to the parlour; said, in hurried tones,\r\nthat he had to go out on matters of importance, but would be back to\r\ndine at five, and putting on his hat, left the cottage in company with\r\nthe strange sailor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN DUNNING ASTONISHES THE STRANGER--SURPRISING NEWS, AND DESPERATE\r\nRESOLVES.\r\n\r\nStill keeping his hands in his pockets and the free-and-easy expression\r\non his countenance, the sailor swaggered through the streets of the town\r\nwith Captain Dunning at his side, until he arrived at a very dirty\r\nlittle street, near the harbour, the chief characteristics of which were\r\nnoise, compound smells, and little shops with sea-stores hung out in\r\nfront.  At the farther end of this street the sailor paused before a\r\nsmall public-house.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" said he; \"this is the place w'ere I puts up w'en I'm\r\nashore--w'ich ain't often--that's a fact.  After you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't afraid, air you?\" asked the sailor, in an incredulous tone.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not, my man; but I have an objection to enter a public-house,\r\nunless I cannot help it.  Have you had a glass this morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor looked puzzled, as if he did not see very clearly what the\r\nquestion had to do with the captain's difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the matter o' that, I've had three glasses this mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose you have no objection to try a glass of my favourite\r\ntipple, have you?\"\r\n\r\nThe man smiled, and wiping his mouth with the cuff of his jacket, as if\r\nhe expected the captain was, then and there, about to hand him a glass\r\nof the tipple referred to, said--\r\n\r\n\"No objection wotsomediver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then follow me; I'll take you to the place where _I_ put up sometimes\r\nwhen I'm ashore.  It's not far off.\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes sufficed to transport them from the dirty little street\r\nnear the harbour to the back-parlour of the identical coffee-house in\r\nwhich the captain was first introduced to the reader.  Here, having\r\nwhispered something to the waiter, he proceeded to question his\r\ncompanion on the mysterious business for which he had brought him there.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we have the tipple first?\" suggested the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"It will be here directly.  Have you breakfasted?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Xceptin' the three glasses I told ye of--no.\"\r\n\r\nWell, now, what have you to tell me about the _Termagant_?  You have\r\nalready said that you are one of her crew, and that you were in the boat\r\nthat day when we had a row about the whale.  What more can you tell me?\r\n\r\nThe sailor sat down on a chair, stretched out his legs quite straight,\r\nand very wide apart, and thrust his hands, if possible, deeper into his\r\npockets than they even were thrust before--so deep, in fact, as to\r\nsuggest the idea that there were no pockets there at all--merely holes.\r\nThen he looked at Captain Dunning with a peculiarly sly expression of\r\ncountenance and winked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's not much.  Anything more?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, yes; lots more.  The _Termagant's_ in this yere port--at--this--\r\nyere--moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this was said in a hoarse emphatic whisper, and the\r\nman raising up both legs to a horizontal position, let them fall so that\r\nhis heels came with a crash upon the wooden floor.\r\n\r\n\"Is she?\" cried the captain, with lively interest; \"and her captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's--yere--too!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dunning took one or two hasty strides across the floor, as if he\r\nwere pacing his own quarterdeck--then stopped suddenly and said--\r\n\r\n\"Can you get hold of any more of that boat's crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do nothin' more wotiver, nor say nothin' more wotsomediver, till\r\nI've tasted that 'ere tipple of yourn.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain rang the bell, and the waiter entered with ham and eggs,\r\nbuttered toast, and hot coffee for two.\r\n\r\nThe sailor opened his eyes to their utmost possible width, and made an\r\neffort to thrust his hands still deeper into his unfathomable trousers\r\npockets; then he sat bolt upright, and gathering his legs as close under\r\nhis chair as possible, clasped his knees with his hands, hugged himself,\r\nand grinned from ear to ear.  After sitting a second or two in that\r\nposition, he jumped up, and going forward to the table, took up the\r\nplate of ham and eggs, as if to make sure that it was a reality, and\r\nsmelt it.\r\n\r\n\"Is _this_ your favourite tipple?\" he said, on being quite satisfied of\r\nthe reality of what he saw.\r\n\r\n\"Coffee is my favourite drink,\" replied the captain, laughing.  \"I never\r\ntake anything stronger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! you're a to-teetler?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.  Now, my man, as you have not yet had breakfast, and as you\r\ninterrupted me in the middle of mine, suppose we sit down and discuss\r\nthe matter of the whale over this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is the rummiest way of offerin' to give a fellow a glass as\r\nI ever did come across since I was a tadpole, as sure as my name's Dick\r\nJones,\" remarked the sailor, sitting down opposite the captain, and\r\nturning up the cuffs of his coat.\r\n\r\nHaving filled his mouth to its utmost possible extent, the astonished\r\nseaman proceeded, at one and the same time, to masticate and to relate\r\nall that he knew in regard to the _Termagant_.\r\n\r\nHe said that not only was that vessel in port at that time, but that the\r\nsame men were still aboard; that the captain--Dixon by name--was still\r\nin command, and that the whale which had been seized from the crew of\r\nthe _Red Eric_ had been sold along with the rest of the cargo.  He\r\nrelated; moreover, how that he and his comrades had been very\r\nill-treated by Captain Dixon during the voyage, and that he (Captain D)\r\nwas, in the opinion of himself and his shipmates, the greatest\r\nblackguard afloat, and had made them so miserable by his brutality and\r\ntyranny, that they all hoped they might never meet with his like again--\r\nnot to mention the hopes and wishes of a very unfeeling nature which\r\nthey one and all expressed in regard to that captain's future career.\r\nBesides all this, he stated that he (Dick Jones) had recognised Captain\r\nDunning when he landed that morning, and had followed him to the cottage\r\nwith the yellow face and the green door; after which he had taken a turn\r\nof half-an-hour or so up and down the street to think what he ought to\r\ndo, and had at last resolved to tell all that he knew, and offer to\r\nstand witness against his captain, which he was then and there prepared\r\nto do, at that time or at any future period, wherever he (Captain\r\nDunning) liked, and whenever he pleased, and that there was an end of\r\nthe whole matter, and that was a fact.\r\n\r\nHaving unburdened his mind, and eaten all the ham, and eggs, and toast,\r\nand drunk all the coffee, and asked for more and got it, Dick Jones\r\nproceeded to make himself supremely happy by filling his pipe and\r\nlighting it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take him to law,\" said Captain Dunning firmly, smiting the table\r\nwith his fist.\r\n\r\n\"I know'd a feller,\" said Jones, \"wot always said, w'en he heard a\r\nfeller say that, `You'll come for to wish that ye hadn't;' but I think\r\nye're right, cap'en; for it's a clear case, clear as daylight; an' we'll\r\nall swear to a'most anything as'll go fur to prove it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure your messmates are as willing as you are to witness\r\nagainst the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure?  In coorse I is--sartin sure.  Didn't he lamp two on 'em with a\r\nrope's-end once till they wos fit to bust, and all for nothin' but\r\nskylarkin'?  They'll all go in the same boat with me, 'cept perhaps the\r\ncook, who is named Baldwin.  He's a cross-grained critter, an'll stan'\r\nby the cap'en through thick an thin, an' so will the carpenter--Box they\r\ncall him--he's dead agin us; but that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll do it at once,\" cried Captain Dunning, rising and putting on\r\nhis hat firmly, as a man does when he has made a great resolve, which he\r\nmore than half suspects will get him into a world of difficulties and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose I may set here till ye come back?\" inquired Dick Jones, who\r\nnow wore a dim mysterious aspect, in consequence of the cloud of smoke\r\nin which he had enveloped himself.\r\n\r\n\"You may sit there till they turn you out; but come and take breakfast\r\nwith me at the same hour to-morrow, will ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then good-day.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the captain left the coffee-house, and hurried to his\r\nsisters' cottage, where he rightly conjectured he should find Glynn\r\nProctor.  Without telling his sisters the result of the interview with\r\nthe \"rude seaman,\" he took Glynn's arm and sallied forth in search of\r\nTim Rokens and Mr Millons, both of whom they discovered enjoying their\r\npipes, after a hearty breakfast, in a small, unpretending, but excellent\r\nand comfortable \"sailors' home,\" in the dirty little street before\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the crew of the late _Red Eric_ (now \"sticks and\r\nstivers\") were found in the same place, engaged in much the same\r\noccupation, and to these, in solemn conclave assembled, Captain Dunning\r\nannounced his intention of opening a law-suit against the captain of the\r\n_Termagant_ for the unlawful appropriation of the whale harpooned by\r\nGlynn.  The men highly approved of what they called a \"shore-going\r\nscrimmage,\" and advised the captain to go and have the captain and crew\r\nof the _Termagant_ \"put in limbo right off.\"\r\n\r\nThus advised and encouraged, Captain Dunning went to a lawyer, who,\r\nafter hearing the case, stated it as his opinion that it was a good one,\r\nand forthwith set about taking the needful preliminary steps to\r\ncommencing the action.\r\n\r\nThereafter Captain Dunning walked rapidly home, wiping his hot brow as\r\nhe went, and entering the parlour of the cottage--the yellow-faced\r\ncottage--flung himself on the sofa with a reckless air, and said, \"I've\r\ndone it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Horror!\" cried Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Misery!\" gasped Aunt Jane, who happened to be fondling Ailie at the\r\ntime of her brother's entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Quite_ dead?\" added Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Is _who_ dead?\" inquired the captain, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"The man--the rude sailor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!  No.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said just now that you had done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I have.  I've done the deed.  I've gone to law.\"\r\n\r\nHad the captain said that he had gone to \"sticks and stivers,\" his\r\nsisters could not have been more startled and horrified.  They dreaded\r\nthe law, and hated it with a great and intense hatred, and not without\r\nreason; for their father had been ruined in a law-suit, and his father\r\nhad broken the law, in some political manner they could never clearly\r\nunderstand, and had been condemned by the law to perpetual banishment.\r\n\r\n\"Will it do you much harm, dear, papa?\" inquired Ailie, in great\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\"Harm?  Of course not.  I hope it'll do me, and you too, a great deal of\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm _so_ glad to hear that; for I've heard people say that when you\r\nonce go into it you never get out of it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I,\" said Aunt Martha, with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"And so have I,\" added Aunt Jane, with a deeper sigh, \"and I believe\r\nit's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's false!\" cried the captain, laughing, \"and you are all silly geese;\r\nthe law is--\"\r\n\r\n\"A bright and glorious institution!  A desirable investment for the\r\ntalents of able men!  A machine for justice usually--injustice\r\noccasionally--and, like all other good things, often misused, abused,\r\nand spoken against!\" said Glynn Proctor, at that moment entering the\r\nroom, and throwing his hat on one chair, and himself on another.  \"I've\r\nhad enough of the sea, captain, and have come to resign my situation,\r\nand beg for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it immediately, dear Glynn,\" said Martha, whose heart\r\nwarmed at the sight of one who had been so kind to her little niece.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I'm in no hurry,\" said Glynn, quickly; \"I did but jest, dear\r\nmadam, as Shakespeare has it.  Perhaps it was Milton who said it; one\r\ncan't be sure; but whenever a truly grand remark escapes you, you're\r\nsafe to clap it down to Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the servant-girl announced dinner.  At the same instant a\r\nheavy foot was heard in the passage, and Tim Rokens announced himself,\r\nsaying that he had just seen the captain's lawyer, and had been sent to\r\nsay that he wished to see Captain Dunning in the course of the evening.\r\n\r\n\"Then let him go on wishing till I'm ready to go to him.  Meanwhile do\r\nyou come and dine with us, Rokens, my lad.\"\r\n\r\nRokens looked awkward, and shuffled a little with his feet, and shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter, man?\"\r\n\r\nRokens looked as if he wished to speak, but hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"If ye please, cap'en, I'd raither not, axin' the ladies' parding.  I'd\r\nlike a word with you in the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" replied the captain, going out of the room with the\r\nsailor.  \"Now, what's wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"My flippers, cap'en,\" said Rokens, thrusting out his hard, thick,\r\nenormous hands, which were stained all over with sundry streaks of tar,\r\nand were very red as well as extremely clumsy to look at--\"I've bin an'\r\nwashed 'em with hot water and rubbed 'em with grease till I a'most took\r\nthe skin off, but they won't come clean, and I'm not fit to sit down\r\nwith ladies.\"\r\n\r\nTo this speech the captain replied by seizing Tim Rokens by the collar\r\nand dragging him fairly into the parlour.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a man,\" cried the captain enthusiastically, presenting him to\r\nMartha, \"who's sailed with me for nigh thirty years, and is the best\r\nharpooner I ever had, and has stuck to me through thick and thin, in\r\nfair weather and foul, in heat and cold, and was kinder to Ailie during\r\nthe last voyage than all the other men put together, exceptin' Glynn,\r\nand who tells me his hands are covered with tar, and that he can't wash\r\n'em clean nohow, and isn't fit to dine with ladies; so you will oblige\r\nme, Martha, by ordering him to leave the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, brother, with pleasure.  I order you, Mr Rokens, to leave this\r\nhouse _at your peril_!  And I invite you to partake of our dinner, which\r\nis now on the table in the next room.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Aunt Martha grasped one of the great tar-stained \"flippers\"\r\nin both of her own delicate hands, and shook it with a degree of vigour\r\nthat Tim Rokens afterwards said he could not have believed possible had\r\nhe not felt it.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Aunt Jane turned aside and blew her nose violently.  Tim\r\nRokens attempted to make a bow, failed, and grinned.  The captain\r\ncried--\"Now, then, heave ahead!\"  Glynn, in the exuberance of his\r\nspirits, uttered a miniature cheer.  Ailie gave vent to a laugh, that\r\nsounded as sweet as a good song; and the whole party adjourned to the\r\ndining-room, where the servant-girl was found in the sulks because\r\ndinner was getting rapidly cold, and the cat was found:--\r\n\r\n  \"Prowling round the festal board\r\n  On thievish deeds intent.\"\r\n\r\n[See Milton's _Paradise Regained_, latest edition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW-SUIT--THE BATTLE, AND THE VICTORY.\r\n\r\nThe great case of Dunning _versus_ Dixon came on at last.\r\n\r\nOn that day Captain Dunning was in a fever; Glynn Proctor was in a\r\nfever; Tim Rokens was in a fever; the Misses Dunning were in two\r\nseparate fevers--everybody, in fact, on the Dunning side of the case was\r\nin a fever of nervous anxiety and mental confusion.  As witnesses in the\r\ncase, they had been precognosced to such an extent by the lawyers that\r\ntheir intellects were almost overturned.  On being told that he was to\r\nbe precognosced.  Tim Rokens said stoutly, \"He'd like to see the man as\r\n'ud do it\"; under the impression that that was the legal term for being\r\nkicked, or otherwise maltreated; and on being informed that the word\r\nsignified merely an examination as to the extent of his knowledge of the\r\nfacts of the case, he said quietly, \"Fire away!\"  Before they had done\r\nfiring away, the gallant harpooner was so confused that he began to\r\nregard the whole case as already hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe other men were much in the same condition; but in a private meeting\r\nheld among themselves the day before the trial, Rokens made the\r\nfollowing speech, which comforted them not a little.\r\n\r\n\"Messmates and shipmates,\" said Tim, \"I'll tell ye wot it is.  I'm no\r\nlawyer--that's a fact--but I'm a man; an' wot's a man?--it ain't a\r\nbundle o' flesh an' bones on two legs, with a turnip a-top o't, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be no manes,\" murmured Briant, with an approving nod.\r\n\r\n\"Cer'nly not,\" remarked Dick Barnes.  \"I second that motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" continued Rokens.  \"Then, bein' a man, I've got brains enough to\r\nsee that, if we don't want to contredick one another, we must stick to\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose I'd go fur to tell lies, do you?\" said Tarquin\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\"In coorse not.  But what I mean to say is, that we must stick to what\r\nwe _knows_ to be the truth, and not be goin' for to guess at it, or\r\n_think_ that we knows it, and then swear to it as if we wos certain\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear! hear!\" from the assembled company.\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" observed Glynn, \"let what we say be absolutely true, and say\r\njust as little as we can.  That's how to manage a good case.\"\r\n\r\n\"An', be all manes,\" added Briant, \"don't let any of ye try for to\r\nimprove matters be volunteerin' yer opinion.  Volunteerin' opinions is\r\nstuff.  Volunteerin' is altogether a bad look-out.  I know'd a feller, I\r\ndid--a strappin' young feller he was, too, more betoken--as volunteered\r\nhimself to death, he did.  To be sure, his wos a case o' volunteerin'\r\ninto the Louth Militia, and he wos shot, he wos, in a pop'lar riot, as\r\nthe noosepapers said--a scrimmage, I calls it--so don't let any o' us be\r\ngoin' for to volunteer opinions w'en nobody axes 'em--no, nor wants\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nBriant looked so pointedly at Gurney while delivering this advice that\r\nthat obese individual felt constrained to look indignant, and inquire\r\nwhether \"them 'ere imperent remarks wos meant for him.\"  To which Briant\r\nreplied that \"they wos meant for him, as well as for ivery man then\r\npresent.\"  Whereupon Gurney started up and shook his fist across the\r\ntable at Briant, and Briant made a face at Gurney, at which the\r\nassembled company of mariners laughed, and immediately thereafter the\r\nmeeting was broken up.\r\n\r\nNext day the trial came on, and as the case was expected to be more than\r\nusually interesting, the house was filled to overflowing long before the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted all that day, and all the next, and a great part of the\r\nthird, but we do not purpose going into it in detail.  The way in which\r\nMr Rasp (Captain Dunning's counsel) and Mr Tooth (Captain Dixon's\r\ncounsel) badgered, browbeat, and utterly bamboozled the witnesses on\r\nboth sides, and totally puzzled the jury, can only be understood by\r\nthose who have frequented courts of law, but could not be fully or\r\nadequately described in less than six hundred pages.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the trial the resolutions come to by the crew of the\r\n_Red Eric_, that they would tell _nothing_ but the truth, and carefully\r\nrefrain from touching on what they were not quite sure of, proved to be\r\nof the greatest advantage to the pursuer's case.  We feel constrained\r\nhere to turn aside for one moment to advise the general adoption of that\r\ncourse of conduct in all the serious affairs of life.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Tim Rokens was clear and to the point.  The whale had\r\nbeen first struck by Glynn with a harpoon, to which a drogue was\r\nattached; it had been followed up by the crew of the _Red Eric_ and also\r\nby the crew of the _Termagant_.  The boats of the latter over-took the\r\nfish first, fixed a harpoon in it, and lanced it mortally.  The drogue\r\nand harpoon of the _Red Eric_ were still attached to the whale when this\r\nwas done, so that, according to the laws of the fishery, the crew of the\r\n_Termagant_ had no right to touch the whale--it was a \"fast\" fish.  If\r\nthe drogue had become detached the fish would have been free, and both\r\ncrews would have been entitled to chase and capture it if they were\r\nable.  Angry words and threats had passed between the crews of the\r\nopposing boats, but the whale put a stop to that by smashing the boat of\r\nthe _Red Eric_ with its tail, whereupon the boat of the _Termagant_ made\r\noff with the fish (which died almost immediately after), and left the\r\ncrew of the boat belonging to the _Red Eric_ struggling in the water.\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of the evidence of the harpooner, and neither\r\ncross-examination nor re-cross-examination by Mr Tooth, the counsel for\r\nthe defendant, could induce Tim Rokens to modify, alter, omit, or\r\ncontradict one iota of what he had said.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that all of the men gave their\r\nevidence so clearly or so well.  The captain did, though he was somewhat\r\nnervous, and the doctor did, and Glynn did.  But that of Nikel Sling was\r\nunsatisfactory, in consequence of his being unable to repress his\r\nnatural tendency to exaggeration.  Tarquin also did harm; for, in his\r\nspite against the crew of the _Termagant_, he made statements which were\r\nnot true, and his credit as a witness was therefore totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nLast of all came Jim Scroggles, who, after being solemnly sworn, deposed\r\nthat he was between thirty-five and thirty-six years of age, on hearing\r\nwhich Gurney said \"Oh!\" with peculiar emphasis, and the people laughed,\r\nand the judge cried \"Silence,\" and the examination went on.  After some\r\ntime Mr Tooth rose to cross-question Jim Scroggles, who happened to be\r\na nervous man in public, and was gradually getting confused and angry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my man, please to be particular in your replies,\" said Mr Tooth,\r\npushing up his spectacles on his forehead, thrusting his hands into his\r\ntrousers pockets, and staring very hard at Jim.  \"You said that you\r\npulled the second oar from the bow on the day in which the whale was\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure of that?  Was it not the _third_ oar, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes or no,\" interrupted Mr Tooth.\r\n\r\n\"It's so long since--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes or no,\" repeated Mr Tooth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" roared Scroggles, forgetting at the moment, in his confusion and\r\nindignation at not being allowed to speak, in what manner the question\r\nhad been put.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" echoed Mr Tooth, addressing the judge, but looking at the jury.\r\n\"You will observe, gentlemen.  Would your lordship be so good as to note\r\nthat?  This witness, on that very particular occasion, when every point\r\nin the circumstances must naturally have been impressed deeply on the\r\nmemories of all present, appears to have been so confused as not to know\r\nwhich oar of the boat he pulled.  So, my man\" (turning to the witness),\r\n\"it appears evident that either you are now mis-stating the facts of the\r\ncase or were then incapable of judging of them.\"\r\n\r\nJim Scroggles felt inclined to leap out of the witness-box, and knocked\r\nthe teeth of Mr Tooth down his throat!  But he repressed the\r\ninclination, and that gentleman went on to say--\r\n\r\n\"When the boat of the _Red Eric_ came up to the whale was the drogue\r\nstill attached to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In coorse it was.  Didn't ye hear me say that three or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Be so good as to answer my questions simply, and do not make\r\nunnecessary remarks, sir.  Was the drogue attached when the boat came\r\nup?  Yes or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I seed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite sure that you saw it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In coorse!--leastwise, Tim Rokens seed it, and all the men in the boat\r\nseed it, and said so to me afterwards--w'ich is the same thing, though I\r\ncan't 'xactly say I seed it myself, 'cause I was looking hard at the men\r\nin the enemy's boat, and considerin' which on 'em I should give a dab in\r\nthe nose to first w'en we come along side of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then you did _not_ see the drogue attached to the whale?\" said Mr\r\nTooth, with a glance at the jury; \"and you were so taken up with the\r\nanticipated fight, I suppose, that you scarcely gave your attention to\r\nthe whale at all!  Were the other men in your boat in a similarly\r\nunobservant condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" exclaimed Scroggles.\r\n\r\n\"Were the other men as eager for the fight as you were?\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose they wos; you'd better ax 'em.  _I_ dun know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't suppose you do, considering the state of mind you appear to\r\nhave been in at the time.  Do you know which part of the whale struck\r\nyour boat?  Was it the head?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it was the tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, yes, quite sartin, for I've got a knot on my head this day where\r\nthe tip of its flukes came down on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite sure of that?  Might it not have been the part of the fish\r\nnear the tail, now, that struck you, or the fin just under the tail?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I'm quite sartin sure it warn't _that_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you so sure it wasn't that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because whales hain't got no fins just under their tails!\" replied\r\nScroggles, with a broad grin.\r\n\r\nThere was another loud laugh at this, and Mr Tooth looked a little put\r\nout, and the judge cried \"Silence\" again, and threatened to clear the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more questions Jim Scroggles was permitted to retire, which\r\nhe did oppressed with a feeling that his evidence had done the case\r\nlittle good, if not some harm, yet rather elated than otherwise at the\r\nsuccess of his last hit.\r\n\r\nThat evening Captain Dunning supped with Ailie and his sisters in low\r\nspirits.  Glynn and the doctor and Tim Rokens and the two mates, Millons\r\nand Markham, supped with him, also in low spirits; and King Bumble acted\r\nthe part of waiter, for that sable monarch had expressed an earnest\r\ndesire to become Captain Dunning's servant, and the captain had agreed\r\nto \"take him on,\" at least for a time.  King Bumble was also in low\r\nspirits; and, as a natural consequence, so were Aunts Martha and Jane\r\nand little Ailie.  It seemed utterly incomprehensible to the males of\r\nthe party, how so good a case as this should come to wear such an\r\nunpromising aspect.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said the captain, at the conclusion of a prolonged\r\ndiscussion, \"I don't believe we'll gain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said the doctor, helping himself to a large quantity of\r\nsalad, as if that were the only comfort now left to him, and he meant to\r\nmake the most of it before giving way to total despair.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" observed Aunt Martha firmly.  \"I always said the law was a\r\nwicked institution.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great shame!\" said Aunt Jane indignantly; \"but what could we\r\nexpect?  It treats every one ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't it treat Captain Dixon well, if he wins, aunt?\" inquired Ailie.\r\n\r\n\"Dear child, what can you possibly know about law?\" said Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like a little more tart?\" asked Aunt Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!  Ailie,\" cried Glynn, \"that's a fair question.  I back it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do you claim for damages, George?\" inquired Aunt Martha,\r\nchanging the subject.\r\n\r\n(\"Question!\" whispered Glynn.)\r\n\r\n\"Two thousand pounds,\" answered the captain.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the aunts, in a simultaneous burst of amazement.  \"All\r\nfor _one_ fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it was a big one, you see, and Dick Jones, one of the men of the\r\n_Termagant_, told me it was sold for that.  It's a profitable fishing,\r\nwhen one doesn't lose one's ship.  What do you say to go with me and\r\nAilie on our next trip, sisters?  You might use up all your silk and\r\nworsted thread and crooked pins.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense you talk, George; but I suppose you really do use pretty\r\nlarge hooks and lines when you fish for whales?\"\r\n\r\nAunt Martha addressed the latter part of her remark to Tim Rokens, who\r\nseemed immensely tickled by the captain's pleasantry.\r\n\r\n\"Hooks and lines, ma'am!\" cried Rokens, regarding his hostess with a\r\nlook of puzzled surprise.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure we do,\" interrupted Glynn; \"we use anchors baited with live\r\ncrocodiles--sometimes elephants, when we can't get crocodiles.  But\r\nhippopotamuses do best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Glynn!\" cried Ailie, laughing, \"how can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It all depends on the drogue,\" remarked the doctor.  \"I'm surprised to\r\nfind how few of the men can state with absolute certainty that they saw\r\nthe drogue attached to the whale when the boat came up to it.  It all\r\nhinges upon that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed Mr Millons, \"the 'ole case 'inges on that, because that\r\nproves it was a fast fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Mr Millons,\" said Aunt Martha, smiling, \"I have heard of fast\r\nyoung men, but I never heard of a fast fish before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you, ma'am?\" exclaimed the first mate, looking up in surprise,\r\nfor that matter-of-fact seamen seldom recognised a joke at first sight.\r\n\r\nAunt Martha, who very rarely ventured on the perpetration of a joke,\r\nblushed, and turning somewhat hastily to Mr Markham, asked if he would\r\n\"take another cup of tea.\"  Seeing that there was no tea on the table,\r\nshe substituted \"another slice of ham,\" and laughed.  Thereupon the\r\nwhole company laughed, and from that moment their spirits began to rise.\r\nThey began to discuss the more favourable points of the evidence led\r\nthat day, and when they retired at a late hour to rest, their hopes had\r\nagain become sanguine.\r\n\r\nNext morning the examination of the witnesses for the defendant came on.\r\nThere were more of them than Dick Jones had expected; for the crew of\r\nthe _Termagant_ happened to be partly made up of very bad men, who were\r\neasily bribed by their captain to give evidence in his favour.  But it\r\nsoon became evident that they had not previously determined, as Captain\r\nDunning's men had done, to stick to the simple truth.  They not only\r\ncontradicted each other but each contradicted himself more than once;\r\nand it amazed them all, more than they could tell, to find how easily\r\nMr Rasp turned their thoughts outside in, and caused them to prove\r\nconclusively that they were telling falsehoods.\r\n\r\nAfter the case had been summed up by the judge, the jury retired to\r\nconsult, but they only remained five minutes away, and then came back\r\nwith a verdict in favour of the pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"Who's the `pursooers?'\" inquired Gurney, when this was announced to him\r\nby Nikel Sling.  \"Ain't we all pursooers?  Wasn't we all pursooing the\r\nwhale together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you grampus!\" cried Nikel, laughing.  \"Don't ye know that _we_ is\r\nthe purshooers, 'cause why?  We're purshooin' the cap'en and crew of the\r\n_Termagant_ at law, and means to purshoo 'em too, I guess, till they\r\nstumps up for that air whale.  And they is the defendants, 'cause\r\nthey're s'posed to defend themselves to the last gasp; but it ain't o'\r\nno manner o' use.\"\r\n\r\nNikel Sling was right.  Captain Dixon _was_ pursued until he paid back\r\nthe value of his ill-gotten whale, and was forcibly reminded by this\r\nepisode in his career, that \"honesty is the best policy\" after all.\r\nThus Captain Dunning found himself suddenly put in possession of a sum\r\nof two thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe trouble, and worry, and annoyance that the sum of 2000 pounds gave\r\nto Captain Dunning is past all belief.  That worthy man, knowing that\r\nGlynn Proctor had scarcely a penny in the world, not even his \"kit\" (as\r\nsailors name their sea-chests), which had been lost in the wreck of the\r\n_Red Eric_, and that the boy was about to be cast upon the world again\r\nan almost friendless wanderer--knowing all this, we say, Captain Dunning\r\ninsisted that as Glynn had been the first to strike the whale, and as no\r\none else had had anything to do with its capture, he (Glynn) was justly\r\nentitled to the money.\r\n\r\nGlynn firmly declined to admit the justice of this view of the case; he\r\nhad been paid his wages; that was all he had any right to claim; so he\r\npositively refused to take the money.  But the captain was more than his\r\nmatch.  He insisted so powerfully, and argued so logically, that Glynn\r\nat last consented, on condition that 500 pounds of it should be\r\ndistributed among his shipmates.  This compromise was agreed to, and\r\nthus Glynn came into possession of what appeared in his eyes a fortune\r\nof 1500 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what am I to do with it? that is the question.\"\r\n\r\nGlynn propounded this knotty question one evening, about three weeks\r\nafter the trial, to his friends of the yellow cottage with the\r\ngreen-painted door.\r\n\r\n\"Put it in the bank,\" suggested Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and live on the interest,\" added Aunt Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Or invest in the whale-fishery,\" said Captain Dunning, emitting a\r\nvoluminous cloud of tobacco-smoke, as if to suggest the idea that the\r\ninvestment would probably end in something similar to that.  (The\r\ncaptain was a peculiarly favoured individual; he was privileged to smoke\r\nin the Misses Dunning's parlour.)\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I'll tell you what to do, Glynn,\" cried Ailie, clapping her hands;\r\n\"it would be _so_ nice.  Buy a cottage with it--a nice, pretty,\r\nwhite-painted cottage, beside a wood, with a little river in front of\r\nit, and a small lake with a boat on it not far off, and a far, far view\r\nfrom the windows of fields, and villages, and churches, and cattle, and\r\nsheep, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!  Ailie, go it, my lass!\" interrupted Glynn; \"and horses, and\r\nponies, and carts, and cats, and blackbirds, and cocks and hens, and\r\nploughmen, and milkmaids, and beggars, all in the foreground; and\r\ncoaches, and railroads, and steamboats, and palaces, and canals, in the\r\nmiddle distance; with a glorious background of the mighty sea glittering\r\nfor ever under the blazing beams of a perpetually setting sun, mingled\r\nwith the pale rays of an eternally rising moon, and laden with small\r\ncraft, and whale-ships, and seaweed, and fish, and bumboats, and\r\nmen-of-war!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how nice!\" cried Ailie, screaming with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead, lad, never give in!\" said the captain; whose pipe during this\r\nglowing description had been keeping up what seemed like a miniature\r\nsea-fight.  \"You've forgot the main point.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" inquired Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Why, a palace for Jacko close beside it, with a portrait of Jacko over\r\nthe drawing-room fireplace, and a marble bust of Jacko in the four\r\ncorners of every room.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did; I forgot that,\" replied Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Jacko!\" said Ailie, laughing heartily, and holding out her hand.\r\n\r\nThe monkey, which had become domesticated in the house, leaped nimbly\r\nupon her knee, and looked up in her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Ailie dear, do put it down!\" cried Aunt Jane, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"How can you?\" said Aunt Martha; \"dirty beast!\"  Of course Aunt Martha\r\napplied the latter part of her remark to the monkey, not to the child.\r\n\r\n\"I'll never be able to bear it,\" remarked Aunt Jane.\r\n\r\n\"And it will never come to agree with the cat,\" observed Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\nAilie patted her favourite on the cheek and told it to go away, adding,\r\nthat it was a dear pet--whereupon that small monkey retired modestly to\r\na corner near the sideboard.  It chanced to be the corner nearest to the\r\nsugar-basin, which had been left out by accident; but Jacko didn't know\r\nthat, of course--at least, if he did, he did not say so.  It is\r\nprobable, however, that he found it out in course of time; for an hour\r\nor two afterwards the distinct marks of ten very minute fingers were\r\nvisible therein, a discovery which Aunt Martha made with a scream, and\r\nAunt Jane announced with a shriek--which caused Jacko to retire\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\n\"But really,\" said Glynn, \"jesting apart, I must take to something on\r\nshore, for although I like the sea very well, I find that I like the\r\nland better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you wish to be in earnest about it,\" said Captain Dunning,\r\n\"I'll tell you what has been passing in my mind of late.  I'm getting to\r\nbe an oldish young man now, you see, and am rather tired of the sea\r\nmyself, so I also think of giving it up.  I have now laid by about five\r\nthousand pounds, and with this I think of purchasing a farm.  I learnt\r\nsomething of farming before I took to the sea, so that I am not quite so\r\ngreen on such matters as you might suppose, though I confess I'm rather\r\nrusty and behind the age; but that won't much matter in a fine country\r\nlike this, and I can get a good steward to take command and steer the\r\nship until I have brushed up a bit in shore-goin' navigation.  There is\r\na farm which is just the very thing for me not more than twenty miles\r\nfrom this town, with a cottage on it and a view _somewhat_ like the one\r\nyou and Ailie described a few minutes ago, though not _quite_ so grand.\r\nBut there's one great and insuperable objection to my taking it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" inquired Aunt Martha, who, with her sister, expressed in\r\ntheir looks unbounded surprise at the words of their brother, whom they\r\nregarded as so thoroughly and indissolubly connected with the sea that\r\nthey would probably have been less surprised had he announced it to be\r\nhis intention to become a fish and thenceforward dwell in a coral cave.\r\n\r\n\"I have not enough of money wherewith to buy and stock it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_What_ a pity!\" said Ailie, whose hopes had been rising with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, and were thus quenched at once.\r\n\r\nGlynn leaped up and smote his thigh with his right hand, and exclaimed\r\nin a triumphant manner--\"That's the very ticket!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the very ticket?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I'll lend you _my_ money,\" said Glynn.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, boy, that's just the point I was comin' to.  A thousand pounds will\r\ndo.  Now, if you lend me that sum, I'm willin' to take you into\r\npartnership, and we'll buy the place and farm it together.  I think\r\nwe'll pull well in the same boat, for I think you like me well enough,\r\nand I'm sure I like you, and I know Ailie don't object to either of us;\r\nand after I'm gone, Glynn, you can work the farm for Ailie and give her\r\nher share.  What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Done,\" exclaimed Glynn, springing up and seizing the captain's hand.\r\n\"I'll be your son and you'll be my father, and Ailie will be my sister--\r\nand _won't_ we be jolly, just!\"\r\n\r\nAilie laughed, and so did the two aunts, but the captain made no reply.\r\nHe merely smoked with a violence that was quite appalling, and nodding\r\nhis head, winked at Glynn, as if to say--\"That's it, exactly!\"\r\n\r\nThe compact thus half-jestingly entered into was afterwards thoroughly\r\nratified and carried into effect.  The cottage was named the Red Eric,\r\nand the property was named the Whale Brae, after an ancestral estate\r\nwhich, it was supposed, had, at some remote period, belonged to the\r\nDunning family in Scotland.  The title was not inappropriate, for it\r\noccupied the side of a rising ground, which, as a feature in the\r\nlandscape, looked very like a whale, \"only,\" as Glynn said, \"not quite\r\nso big,\" which was an outrageous falsehood, for it was a great deal\r\nbigger!  A small wooden palace was built for Jacko, and many a portrait\r\nwas taken of him by Glynn, in charcoal, on many an outhouse wall, to the\r\nimmense delight of Ailie.  As to having busts of him placed in the\r\ncorners of every room, Glynn remarked that that was quite unnecessary,\r\nfor Jacko _almost_ \"bu'st\" himself in every possible way, at every\r\nconceivable time, in every imaginable place, whenever he could\r\nconveniently collect enough of food to do so--which was not often, for\r\nJacko, though small, was of an elastic as well as an amiable\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nTim Rokens stuck to his old commander to the last.  He said he had\r\nsailed with him the better part of his life, in the same ships, had\r\nweathered the same storms, and chased the same fish, and now that the\r\ncaptain had made up his mind to lay up in port, he meant to cast anchor\r\nbeside him.  So the bold harpooner became a species of overseer and\r\njack-of-all-trades on the property.  Phil Briant set up as a carpenter\r\nin the village close by, took to himself a wife (his first wife having\r\ndied), and became Tim Rokens' boon companion and bosom friend.  As for\r\nthe rest of the crew of the _Red Eric_, they went their several ways,\r\ngot into separate ships, and were never again re-assembled together; but\r\nnearly all of them came at separate times, in the course of years, to\r\nvisit their old captain and shipmates in the Red Eric at Whale Brae.\r\n\r\nIn course of time Ailie grew up into such a sweet, pretty, modest,\r\nloveable woman, that the very sight of her did one's heart good.  Love\r\nwas the ruling power in Ailie's heart--love to her God and Saviour and\r\nto all His creatures.  She was not perfect.  Who is?  She had faults,\r\nplenty of them.  Who has not?  But her loving nature covered up\r\neverything with a golden veil so beautiful, that no one saw her faults,\r\nor, if they did, would not believe them to be faults at all.\r\n\r\nGlynn, also, grew up and became a _man_.  Observe, reader, we don't mean\r\nto say that he became a thing with long legs, and broad shoulders, and\r\nwhiskers.  Glynn became a real man; an out-and-out man; a being who\r\nrealised the fact that he had been made and born into the world for the\r\npurpose of doing that world good, and leaving it better than he found\r\nit.  He did not think that to strut, and smoke cigars, and talk loud or\r\nbig, and commence most of his sentences with \"Aw! 'pon my soul!\" was the\r\nsummit of true greatness.  Neither did he, flying in disgust to the\r\nopposite extreme, speak like a misanthrope, and look like a bear, or\r\ndress like a savage.  He came to know the truth of the proverb, that\r\n\"there is a time for all things,\" and following up the idea suggested by\r\nthose words, he came to perceive that there is a place for all things--\r\nthat place being the human heart, when in a true and healthy condition\r\nin all its parts, out of which, in their proper time, some of those \"all\r\nthings\" ought to be ever ready to flow.  Hence Glynn could weep with the\r\nsorrowful and laugh with the gay.  He could wear a red or a blue flannel\r\nshirt, and pull an oar (ay, the best oar) at a rowing match, or he could\r\nread the Bible and pray with a bedridden old woman.  Had Glynn Proctor\r\nbeen a naval commander, he might have sunk, destroyed, or captured\r\nfleets.  Had he been a soldier, he might have stormed and taken cities;\r\nbeing neither, he was a greater man than either, for he could \"_rule his\r\nown spirit_.\"  If you are tempted, dear reader, to think that an easy\r\nmatter, just try it.  Make the effort.  The first time you chance to be\r\nin a towering rage (which I trust, however, may never be), try to keep\r\nyour tongue silent, and, most difficult of all, try at that moment to\r\npray, and see whether your opinion as to your power over your own spirit\r\nbe not changed.\r\n\r\nSuch were Glynn and Ailie.  \"So they married, of course,\" you remark.\r\nWell, reader, and why not?  Nothing could be more natural.  Glynn felt,\r\nand said, too, that nothing was nearer his heart.  And Ailie admitted--\r\nafter being told by Glynn that she must be his wife, for he wanted to\r\nhave her, and was determined to have her whether she would or not--that\r\nher heart was in similar proximity to the idea of marriage.  Captain\r\nDunning did not object--it would have been odd if he had objected to the\r\nfulfilment of his chief earthly desire.  Tim Rokens did not groan when\r\nhe heard of the proposal--by no means; on the contrary, he roared, and\r\nlaughed, and shouted with delight, and went straight off to tell Phil\r\nBriant, who roared a duet with him, and they both agreed that it \"wos\r\nthe most gloriously nat'ral thing they ever did know since they wos\r\nlaunched upon the sea of time!\"\r\n\r\nSo Glynn Proctor and Ailie Dunning were married, and lived long, and\r\nhappily, and usefully at Whale Brae.  Captain Dunning lived with them\r\nuntil he was so old that Ailie's eldest daughter (also named Ailie) had\r\nto lead him from his bedroom each morning to breakfast, and light his\r\npipe for him when he had finished.  And Ailie the second performed her\r\nduties well, and made the old man happy--happier than he could find\r\nwords to express--for Ailie the second was like her mother in all\r\nthings, and greater praise than that could not possibly be awarded to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the cottage with the yellow face and the green door were\r\nkept in good order for many years by one of Ailie the second's little\r\nsisters--Martha by name; and there was much traffic and intercourse\r\nbetween that ancient building and the Red Eric, as long as the two aunts\r\nlived, which was a very long time indeed.  Its green door was, during\r\nthat time, almost battered off its hinges by successive juvenile members\r\nof the Proctor family.  And truly deep and heartfelt was the mourning at\r\nWhale Brae when the amiable sisters were taken away at last.\r\n\r\nAs for Tim Rokens, that ancient mariner became the idol of the young\r\nProctors, as they successively came to be old enough to know his worth.\r\nThe number of ships and boats he made for the boys among them was\r\nabsolutely fabulous.  Equal, perhaps, to about a twentieth part of the\r\nnumber of pipes of tobacco he smoked during his residence there, and\r\nabout double the number of stories told them by Phil Briant during the\r\nsame period.\r\n\r\nKing Bumble lived with the family until his woolly head became as white\r\nas his face was black; and Jacko--poor little Jacko--lived so long, that\r\nhe became big, but he did not become less amiable, or less addicted to\r\nthieving.  He turned grey at last and became as blind as a bat, and\r\nfinally crawled about the house, enfeebled by old age, and wrapped in a\r\nflannel dressing-gown.\r\n\r\nSorrows and joys are the lot of all; they chase each other across the\r\nsky of human life like cloud and sunshine on an April day.  Captain\r\nDunning and his descendants were not exempt from the pains, and toils,\r\nand griefs of life, but they met them in the right spirit, and diffused\r\nso sweet an influence around their dwelling that the neighbours used to\r\nsay--and say truly--of the family at the Red Eric, that they were always\r\ngood-humoured and happy--as happy as the day was long.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
