D\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE OF UTAH\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nLEAH\r\n\r\nTHIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED\r\n\r\nJUNE 1, 1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly six tenths of the earth's land surface receive an annual\r\nrainfall of less than twenty inches, and can be reclaimed for\r\nagricultural purposes only by irrigation and dry-farming. A\r\nperfected world-system of irrigation will convert about one tenth of\r\nthis vast area into an incomparably fruitful garden, leaving about\r\none half of the earth's land surface to be reclaimed, if at all, by\r\nthe methods of dry-farming. The noble system of modern agriculture\r\nhas been constructed almost wholly in countries of abundant\r\nrainfall, and its applications are those demanded for the\r\nagricultural development of humid regions. Until recently irrigation\r\nwas given scant attention, and dry-farming, with its world problem\r\nof conquering one half of the earth, was not considered. These facts\r\nfurnish the apology for the writing of this book.\r\n\r\nOne volume, only, in this world of many books, and that less than a\r\nyear old, is devoted to the exposition of the accepted dry-farm\r\npractices of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe book now offered is the first attempt to assemble and organize\r\nthe known facts of science in their relation to the production of\r\nplants, without irrigation, in regions of limited rainfall. The\r\nneeds of the actual farmer, who must understand the principles\r\nbefore his practices can be wholly satisfactory, have been kept in\r\nview primarily; but it is hoped that the enlarging group of dry-farm\r\ninvestigators will also be helped by this presentation of the\r\nprinciples of dry-farming. The subject is now growing so rapidly\r\nthat there will soon be room for two classes of treatment: one for\r\nthe farmer, and one for the technical student.\r\n\r\nThis book has been written far from large libraries, and the\r\nmaterial has been drawn from the available sources. Specific\r\nreferences are not given in the text, but the names of investigators\r\nor institutions are found with nearly all statements of fact. The\r\nfiles of the Experiment Station Record and Der Jahresbericht der\r\nAgrikultur Chemie have taken the place of the more desirable\r\noriginal publications. Free use has been made of the publications of\r\nthe experiment stations and the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. Inspiration and suggestions have been sought and found\r\nconstantly in the works of the princes of American soil\r\ninvestigation, Hilgard of California and King of Wisconsin. I am\r\nunder deep obligation, for assistance rendered, to numerous friends\r\nin all parts of the country, especially to Professor L. A. Merrill,\r\nwith whom I have collaborated for many years in the study of the\r\npossibilities of dry-farming in Western America.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of dry-farming are stupendous. In the strength of\r\nyouth we may have felt envious of the great ones of old; of Columbus\r\nlooking upon the shadow of the greatest continent; of Balboa\r\nshouting greetings to the resting Pacific; of Father Escalante,\r\npondering upon the mystery of the world, alone, near the shores of\r\nAmerica's Dead Sea. We need harbor no such envyings, for in the\r\nconquest of the nonirrigated and nonirrigable desert are offered as\r\nfine opportunities as the world has known to the makers and shakers\r\nof empires. We stand before an undiscovered land; through the\r\nrestless, ascending currents of heated desert air the vision comes\r\nand goes. With striving eyes the desert is seen covered with\r\nblossoming fields, with churches and homes and schools, and, in the\r\ndistance, with the vision is heard the laughter of happy children.\r\n\r\nThe desert will be conquered.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. WIDTSOE.\r\n\r\nJune 1, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDRY-FARMING DEFINED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry-farming, as at present understood, is the profitable production\r\nof useful crops, without irrigation, on lands that receive annually\r\na rainfall of 20 inches or less. In districts of torrential rains,\r\nhigh winds, unfavorable distribution of the rainfall, or other\r\nwater-dissipating factors, the term \"dry-farming\" is also properly\r\napplied to farming without irrigation under an annual precipitation\r\nof 25 or even 30 inches. There is no sharp demarcation between\r\ndry-and humid-farming.\r\n\r\nWhen the annual precipitation is under 20 inches, the methods of\r\ndry-farming are usually indispensable. When it is over 30 inches,\r\nthe methods of humid-farming are employed; in places where the\r\nannual precipitation is between 20 and 30 inches, the methods to be\r\nused depend chiefly on local conditions affecting the conservation\r\nof soil moisture. Dry-farming, however, always implies farming under\r\na comparatively small annual rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe term \"dry-farming\" is, of course, a misnomer. In reality it is\r\nfarming under drier conditions than those prevailing in the\r\ncountries in which scientific agriculture originated. Many\r\nsuggestions for a better name have been made. \"Scientific\r\nagriculture\" has-been proposed, but all agriculture should be\r\nscientific, and agriculture without irrigation in an arid country\r\nhas no right to lay sole claim to so general a title. \"Dry-land\r\nagriculture,\" which has also been suggested, is no improvement over\r\n\"dry-farming,\" as it is longer and also carries with it the idea of\r\ndryness. Instead of the name \"dry-farming\" it would, perhaps, be\r\nbetter to use the names, \"arid-farming.\" \"semiarid-farming,\"\r\n\"humid-farming,\" and \"irrigation-farming,\" according to the climatic\r\nconditions prevailing in various parts of the world. However, at the\r\npresent time the name \"dry-farming\" is in such general use that it\r\nwould seem unwise to suggest any change. It should be used with the\r\ndistinct understanding that as far as the word \"dry\" is concerned it\r\nis a misnomer. When the two words are hyphenated, however, a\r\ncompound technical term--\"dry-farming\"--is secured which has a\r\nmeaning of its own, such as we have just defined it to be; and\r\n\"dry-farming,\" therefore, becomes an addition to the lexicon.\r\n\r\nDry-versus humid-farming\r\n\r\nDry-farming, as a distinct branch of agriculture, has for its\r\npurpose the reclamation, for the use of man, of the vast unirrigable\r\n\"desert\" or \"semi-desert\" areas of the world, which until recently\r\nwere considered hopelessly barren. The great underlying principles\r\nof agriculture are the same the world over, yet the emphasis to be\r\nplaced on the different agricultural theories and practices must be\r\nshifted in accordance with regional conditions. The agricultural\r\nproblem of first importance in humid regions is the maintenance of\r\nsoil fertility; and since modern agriculture was developed almost\r\nwholly under humid conditions, the system of scientific agriculture\r\nhas for its central idea the maintenance of soil fertility. In arid\r\nregions, on the other hand, the conservation of the natural water\r\nprecipitation for crop production is the important problem; and a\r\nnew system of agriculture must therefore be constructed, on the\r\nbasis of the old principles, but with the conservation of the\r\nnatural precipitation as the central idea. The system of dry-farming\r\nmust marshal and organize all the established facts of science for\r\nthe better utilization, in plant growth, of a limited rainfall. The\r\nexcellent teachings of humid agriculture respecting the maintenance\r\nof soil fertility will be of high value in the development of\r\ndry-farming, and the firm establishment of right methods of\r\nconserving and using the natural precipitation will undoubtedly have\r\na beneficial effect upon the practice of humid agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe problems of dry-farming\r\n\r\nThe dry-farmer, at the outset, should know with comparative accuracy\r\nthe annual rainfall over the area that he intends to cultivate. He\r\nmust also have a good acquaintance with the nature of the soil, not\r\nonly as regards its plant-food content, but as to its power to\r\nreceive and retain the water from rain and snow. In fact, a\r\nknowledge of the soil is indispensable in successful dry-farming.\r\nOnly by such knowledge of the rainfall and the soil is he able to\r\nadapt the principles outlined in this volume to his special needs.\r\n\r\nSince, under dry-farm conditions, water is the limiting factor of\r\nproduction, the primary problem of dry-farming is the most effective\r\nstorage in the soil of the natural precipitation. Only the water,\r\nsafely stored in the soil within reach of the roots, can be used in\r\ncrop production. Of nearly equal importance is the problem of\r\nkeeping the water in the soil until it is needed by plants. During\r\nthe growing season, water may be lost from the soil by downward\r\ndrainage or by evaporation from the surface. It becomes necessary,\r\ntherefore, to determine under what conditions the natural\r\nprecipitation stored in the soil moves downward and by what means\r\nsurface evaporation may be prevented or regulated. The soil-water,\r\nof real use to plants, is that taken up by the roots and finally\r\nevaporated from the leaves. A large part of the water stored in the\r\nsoil is thus used. The methods whereby this direct draft of plants\r\non the soil-moisture may be regulated are, naturally, of the utmost\r\nimportance to the dry-farmer, and they constitute another vital\r\nproblem of the science of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nThe relation of crops to the prevailing conditions of arid lands\r\noffers another group of important dry-farm problems. Some plants use\r\nmuch less water than others. Some attain maturity quickly, and in\r\nthat way become desirable for dry-farming. Still other crops, grown\r\nunder humid conditions, may easily be adapted to dry-farming\r\nconditions, if the correct methods are employed, and in a few\r\nseasons may be made valuable dry-farm crops. The individual\r\ncharacteristics of each crop should be known as they relate\r\nthemselves to a low rainfall and arid soils.\r\n\r\nAfter a crop has been chosen, skill and knowledge are needed in the\r\nproper seeding, tillage, and harvesting of the crop. Failures\r\nfrequently result from the want of adapting the crop treatment to\r\narid conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter the crop has been gathered and stored, its proper use is\r\nanother problem for the dry-farmer. The composition of dry-farm\r\ncrops is different from that of crops grown with an abundance of\r\nwater. Usually, dry-farm crops are much more nutritious and\r\ntherefore should command a higher price in the markets, or should be\r\nfed to stock in corresponding proportions and combinations.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problems of dry-farming are, then, the storage in\r\nthe soil of a small annual rainfall; the retention in the soil of\r\nthe moisture until it is needed by plants; the prevention of the\r\ndirect evaporation of soil-moisture during; the growing season; the\r\nregulation of the amount of water drawn from the soil by plants; the\r\nchoice of crops suitable for growth under arid conditions; the\r\napplication of suitable crop treatments, and the disposal of\r\ndry-farm products, based upon the superior composition of plants\r\ngrown with small amounts of water. Around these fundamental problems\r\ncluster a host of minor, though also important, problems. When the\r\nmethods of dry-farming are understood and practiced, the practice is\r\nalways successful; but it requires more intelligence, more implicit\r\nobedience to nature's laws, and greater vigilance, than farming in\r\ncountries of abundant rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe chapters that follow will deal almost wholly with the problems\r\nabove outlined as they present themselves in the construction of a\r\nrational system of farming without irrigation in countries of\r\nlimited rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE THEORETICAL BASIS OF DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe confidence with which scientific investigators, familiar with\r\nthe arid regions, have attacked the problems of dry-farming rests\r\nlargely on the known relationship of the water requirements of\r\nplants to the natural precipitation of rain and snow. It is a most\r\nelementary fact of plant physiology that no plant can live and grow\r\nunless it has at its disposal a sufficient amount of water.\r\n\r\nThe water used by plants is almost entirely taken from the soil by\r\nthe minute root-hairs radiating from the roots. The water thus taken\r\ninto the plants is passed upward through the stem to the leaves,\r\nwhere it is finally evaporated. There is, therefore, a more or less\r\nconstant stream of water passing through the plant from the roots to\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nBy various methods it is possible to measure the water thus taken\r\nfrom the soil. While this process of taking water from the soil is\r\ngoing on within the plant, a certain amount of soil-moisture is also\r\nlost by direct evaporation from the soil surface. In dry-farm\r\nsections, soil-moisture is lost only by these two methods; for\r\nwherever the rainfall is sufficient to cause drainage from deep\r\nsoils, humid conditions prevail.\r\n\r\nWater for one pound dry matter\r\n\r\nMany experiments have been conducted to determine the amount of\r\nwater used in the production of one pound of dry plant substance.\r\nGenerally, the method of the experiments has been to grow plants in\r\nlarge pots containing weighed quantities of soil. As needed, weighed\r\namounts of water were added to the pots. To determine the loss of\r\nwater, the pots were weighed at regular intervals of three days to\r\none week. At harvest time, the weight of dry matter was carefully\r\ndetermined for each pot. Since the water lost by the pots was also\r\nknown, the pounds of water used for the production of every pound of\r\ndry matter were readily calculated.\r\n\r\nThe first reliable experiments of the kind were undertaken under\r\nhumid conditions in Germany and other European countries. From the\r\nmass of results, some have been selected and presented in the\r\nfollowing table. The work was done by the famous German\r\ninvestigators, Wollny, Hellriegel, and Sorauer, in the early\r\neighties of the last century. In every case, the numbers in the\r\ntable represent the number of pounds of water used for the\r\nproduction of one pound of ripened dry substance:\r\n\r\n\r\nPounds Of Water For One Pound Of Dry Matter\r\n\r\n           Wollny  Hellreigel  Sorauer\r\nWheat              338         459\r\nOats       665     376         569\r\nBarley             310         431\r\nRye        774     353         236\r\nCorn       233\r\nBuckwheat  646     363\r\nPeas       416     273\r\nHorsebeans         282\r\nRed clover         310\r\nSunflowers 490\r\nMillet     447\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the above results, obtained in Germany, that the\r\namount of water required to produce a pound of dry matter is not the\r\nsame for all plants, nor is it the same under all conditions for the\r\nsame plant. In fact, as will be shown in a later chapter, the water\r\nrequirements of any crop depend upon numerous factors, more or less\r\ncontrollable. The range of the above German results is from 233 to\r\n774 pounds, with an average of about 419 pounds of water for each\r\npound of dry matter produced.\r\n\r\nDuring the late eighties and early nineties, King conducted\r\nexperiments similar to the earlier German experiments, to determine\r\nthe water requirements of crops under Wisconsin conditions. A\r\nsummary of the results of these extensive and carefully conducted\r\nexperiments is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nOats     385\r\nBarley   464\r\nCorn     271\r\nPeas     477\r\nClover   576\r\nPotatoes 385\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures in the above table, averaging about 446 pounds, indicate\r\nthat very nearly the same quantity of water is required for the\r\nproduction of crops in Wisconsin as in Germany. The Wisconsin\r\nresults tend to be somewhat higher than those obtained in Europe,\r\nbut the difference is small.\r\n\r\nIt is a settled principle of science, as will be more fully\r\ndiscussed later, that the amount of water evaporated from the soil\r\nand transpired by plant leaves increases materially with an increase\r\nin the average temperature during the growing season, and is much\r\nhigher under a clear sky and in districts where the atmosphere is\r\ndry. Wherever dry-farming is likely to be practiced, a moderately\r\nhigh temperature, a cloudless sky, and a dry atmosphere are the\r\nprevailing conditions. It appeared probable therefore, that in arid\r\ncountries the amount of water required for the production of one\r\npound of dry matter would be higher than in the humid regions of\r\nGermany and Wisconsin. To secure information on this subject,\r\nWidtsoe and Merrill undertook, in 1900, a series of experiments in\r\nUtah, which were conducted upon the plan of the earlier\r\nexperimenters. An average statement of the results of six years'\r\nexperimentation is given in the subjoined table, showing the number\r\nof pounds of water required for one pound of dry matter on fertile\r\nsoils:--\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat       1048\r\nCorn        589\r\nPeas        1118\r\nSugar Beets 630\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Utah findings support strongly the doctrine that the amount of\r\nwater required for the production of each pound of dry matter is\r\nvery much larger under arid conditions, as in Utah, than under humid\r\nconditions, as in Germany or Wisconsin. It must be observed,\r\nhowever, that in all of these experiments the plants were supplied\r\nwith water in a somewhat wasteful manner; that is, they were given\r\nan abundance of water, and used the largest quantity possible under\r\nthe prevailing conditions. No attempt of any kind was made to\r\neconomize water. The results, therefore, represent maximum results\r\nand can be safely used as such. Moreover, the methods of\r\ndry-farming, involving the storage of water in deep soils and\r\nsystematic cultivation, were not employed. The experiments, both in\r\nEurope and America, rather represent irrigated conditions. There are\r\ngood reasons for believing that in Germany, Wisconsin, and Utah the\r\namounts above given can be materially reduced by the employment of\r\nproper cultural methods.\r\n\r\nThe water in the large bottle would be required to produce the grain\r\nin the small bottle.\r\n\r\nIn view of these findings concerning the water requirements of\r\ncrops, it cannot be far from the truth to say that, under average\r\ncultural conditions, approximately 750 pounds of water are required\r\nin an arid district for the production of one pound of dry matter.\r\nWhere the aridity is intense, this figure may be somewhat low, and\r\nin localities of sub-humid conditions, it will undoubtedly be too\r\nhigh. As a maximum average, however, for districts interested in\r\ndry-farming, it can be used with safety.\r\n\r\nCrop-producing power of rainfall\r\n\r\nIf this conclusion, that not more than 750 pounds of water are\r\nrequired under ordinary dry-farm conditions for the production of\r\none pound of dry matter, be accepted, certain interesting\r\ncalculations can be made respecting the possibilities of\r\ndry-farming. For example, the production of one bushel of wheat will\r\nrequire 60 times 750, or 45,000 pounds of water. The wheat kernels,\r\nhowever, cannot be produced without a certain amount of straw, which\r\nunder conditions of dry-farming seldom forms quite one half of the\r\nweight of the whole plant. Let us say, however, that the weights of\r\nstraw and kernels are equal. Then, to produce one bushel of wheat,\r\nwith the corresponding quantity of straw, would require 2 times\r\n45,000, or 90,000 pounds of water. This is equal to 45 tons of water\r\nfor each bushel of wheat. While this is a large figure, yet, in many\r\nlocalities, it is undoubtedly well within the truth. In comparison\r\nwith the amounts of water that fall upon the land as rain, it does\r\nnot seem extraordinarily large.\r\n\r\nOne inch of water over one acre of land weighs approximately 226,875\r\npounds. or over 113 tons. If this quantity of water could be stored\r\nin the soil and used wholly for plant production, it would produce,\r\nat the rate of 45 tons of water for each bushel, about 2-1/2 bushels\r\nof wheat. With 10 inches of rainfall, which up to the present seems\r\nto be the lower limit of successful dry-farming, there is a maximum\r\npossibility of producing 25 bushels of wheat annually.\r\n\r\nIn the subjoined table, constructed on the basis of the discussion\r\nof this chapter, the wheat-producing powers of various degrees of\r\nannual precipitation are shown:--\r\n\r\nOne acre inch of water will produce 2-1/2 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nTen acre inches of water will produce 25 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nFifteen acre inches of water will produce 37-1/2 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nTwenty acre inches of water will produce 50 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nIt must be distinctly remembered, however, that under no known\r\nsystem of tillage can all the water that falls upon a soil be\r\nbrought into the soil and stored there for plant use. Neither is it\r\npossible to treat a soil so that all the stored soil-moisture may be\r\nused for plant production. Some moisture, of necessity, will\r\nevaporate directly from the soil, and some may be lost in many other\r\nways. Yet, even under a rainfall of 12 inches, if only one half of\r\nthe water can be conserved, which experiments have shown to be very\r\nfeasible, there is a possibility of producing 30 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre every other year, which insures an excellent interest on\r\nthe money and labor invested in the production of the crop.\r\n\r\nIt is on the grounds outlined in this chapter that students of the\r\nsubject believe that ultimately large areas of the \"desert\" may be\r\nreclaimed by means of dry-farming. The real question before the\r\ndry-farmer is not, \"Is the rainfall sufficient?\" but rather, \"Is it\r\npossible so to conserve and use the rainfall as to make it available\r\nfor the production of profitable crops?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDRY-FARM AREAS--RAINFALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual precipitation of rain and snow determines primarily the\r\nlocation of dry-farm areas. As the rainfall varies, the methods of\r\ndry-farming must be varied accordingly. Rainfall, alone, does not,\r\nhowever, furnish a complete index of the crop-producing\r\npossibilities of a country.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the rainfall, the amount of snow, the\r\nwater-holding power of the soil, and the various\r\nmoisture-dissipating causes, such as winds, high temperature,\r\nabundant sunshine, and low humidity frequently combine to offset the\r\nbenefits of a large annual precipitation. Nevertheless, no one\r\nclimatic feature represents, on the average, so correctly\r\ndry-farming possibilities as does the annual rainfall. Experience\r\nhas already demonstrated that wherever the annual precipitation is\r\nabove 15 inches, there is no need of crop failures, if the soils are\r\nsuitable and the methods of dry-farming are correctly employed. With\r\nan annual precipitation of 10 to 15 inches, there need be very few\r\nfailures, if proper cultural precautions are taken. With our present\r\nmethods, the areas that receive less than 10 inches of atmospheric\r\nprecipitation per year are not safe for dry-farm purposes. What the\r\nfuture will show in the reclamation of these deserts, without\r\nirrigation, is yet conjectural.\r\n\r\nArid, semiarid, and sub-humid\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to an examination of the areas in the United\r\nStates subject to the methods of dry-farming it may be well to\r\ndefine somewhat more clearly the terms ordinarily used in the\r\ndescription of the great territory involved in the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe states lying west of the 100th meridian are loosely spoken of as\r\narid, semiarid, or sub-humid states. For commercial purposes no\r\nstate wants to be classed as arid and to suffer under the handicap\r\nof advertised aridity. The annual rainfall of these states ranges\r\nfrom about 3 to over 30 inches.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at greater definiteness, it may be well to assign\r\ndefinite rainfall values to the ordinarily used descriptive terms of\r\nthe region in question. It is proposed, therefore, that districts\r\nreceiving less than 10 inches of atmospheric precipitation annually,\r\nbe designated arid; those receiving between 10 and 20 inches,\r\nsemiarid; those receiving between 20 and 30 inches, sub-humid, and\r\nthose receiving over 30 inches, humid. It is admitted that even such\r\na classification is arbitrary, since aridity does not alone depend\r\nupon the rainfall, and even under such a classification there is an\r\nunavoidable overlapping. However, no one factor so fully represents\r\nvarying degrees of aridity as the annual precipitation, and there is\r\na great need for concise definitions of the terms used in describing\r\nthe parts of the country that come under dry-farming discussions. In\r\nthis volume, the terms \"arid,\" \"semiarid,\" \"sub-humid\" and \"humid\"\r\nare used as above defined.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation over the dry-farm territory\r\n\r\nNearly one half of the United States receives 20 inches or less\r\nrainfall annually; and that when the strip receiving between 20 and\r\n30 inches is added, the whole area directly subject to reclamation\r\nby irrigation or dry-farming is considerably more than one half (63\r\nper cent) of the whole area of the United States.\r\n\r\nEighteen states are included in this area of low rainfall. The areas\r\nof these, as given by the Census of 1900, grouped according to the\r\nannual precipitation received, are shown below:--\r\n\r\n\r\nArid to Semi-arid Group\r\nTotal Area Land Surface (Sq.

If any excuse were needed for\r\nthe lively interest taken in the subject of dry-farming, it is amply\r\nfurnished by these figures showing the vast extent of the country\r\ninterested in the reclamation of land by the methods of dry-farming.\r\nAs will be shown below, nearly every other large country possesses\r\nsimilar immense areas under limited rainfall.\r\n\r\nOf the one billion, one hundred and ninety-one million, four hundred\r\nand fifty-seven thousand, two hundred and eighty acres\r\n(1,191,457,280) representing the dry-farm territory of the United\r\nStates, about 22 per cent, or a little more than one fifth, is\r\nsub-humid and receives between 20 and 30 inches of rainfall,\r\nannually; 61 per cent, or a little more than three fifths, is\r\nsemiarid and receives between 10 and 20 inches, annually, and about\r\n17 per cent, or a little less than one fifth, is arid and receives\r\nless than 10 inches of rainfall, annually.\r\n\r\nThese calculations are based upon the published average rainfall\r\nmaps of the United States Weather Bureau. In the far West, and\r\nespecially over the so-called \"desert\" regions, with their sparse\r\npopulation, meteorological stations are not numerous, nor is it easy\r\nto secure accurate data from them. It is strongly probable that as\r\nmore stations are established, it will be found that the area\r\nreceiving less than 10 inches of rainfall annually is considerably\r\nsmaller than above estimated. In fact, the United States Reclamation\r\nService states that there are only 70,000,000 acres of desert-like\r\nland; that is, land which does not naturally support plants suitable\r\nfor forage. This area is about one third of the lands which, so far\r\nas known, at present receive less than 10 inches of rainfall, or\r\nonly about 6 per cent of the total dry-farming territory.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the semiarid area is at present most vitally interested\r\nin dry-farming. The sub-humid area need seldom suffer from drouth,\r\nif ordinary well-known methods are employed; the arid area,\r\nreceiving less than 10 inches of rainfall, in all probability, can\r\nbe reclaimed without irrigation only by the development of more\r\nsuitable. methods than are known to-day. The semiarid area, which is\r\nthe special consideration of present-day dry-farming represents an\r\narea of over 725,000,000 acres of land. Moreover, it must be\r\nremarked that the full certainty of crops in the sub-humid regions\r\nwill come only with the adoption of dry-farming methods; and that\r\nresults already obtained on the edge of the \"deserts\" lead to the\r\nbelief that a large portion of the area receiving less than 10\r\ninches of rainfall, annually, will ultimately be reclaimed without\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nNaturally, not the whole of the vast area just discussed could be\r\nbrought under cultivation, even under the most favorable conditions\r\nof rainfall. A very large portion of the territory in question is\r\nmountainous and often of so rugged a nature that to farm it would be\r\nan impossibility. It must not be forgotten, however, that some of\r\nthe best dry-farm lands of the West are found in the small mountain\r\nvalleys, which usually are pockets of most fertile soil, under a\r\ngood supply of rainfall. The foothills of the mountains are almost\r\ninvariably excellent dry-farm lands. Newell estimates that\r\n195,000,000 acres of land in the arid to sub-humid sections are\r\ncovered with a more or less dense growth of timber. This timbered\r\narea roughly represents the mountainous and therefore the nonarable\r\nportions of land. The same authority estimates that the desert-like\r\nlands cover an area of 70,000,000 acres. Making the most liberal\r\nestimates for mountainous and desert-like lands, at least one half\r\nof the whole area, or about 600,000,000 acres, is arable land which\r\nby proper methods may be reclaimed for agricultural purposes.\r\nIrrigation when fully developed may reclaim not to exceed 5 per cent\r\nof this area. From any point of view, therefore, the possibilities\r\ninvolved in dry-farming in the United States are immense.\r\n\r\nDry-farm area of the world\r\n\r\nDry-farming is a world problem. Aridity is a condition met and to be\r\novercome upon every continent. McColl estimates that in Australia,\r\nwhich is somewhat larger than the continental United States of\r\nAmerica, only one third of the whole surface receives above 20\r\ninches of rainfall annually; one third receives from 10 to 20\r\ninches, and one third receives less than lO inches. That is, about\r\n1,267,000,000 acres in Australia are subject to reclamation by\r\ndry-farming methods. This condition is not far from that which\r\nprevails in the United States, and is representative of every\r\ncontinent of the world. The following table gives the proportions of\r\nthe earth's land surface under various degrees of annual\r\nprecipitations:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Precipitation  Proportion of Earth's Land Surface\r\nUnder 10 inches       25.0 per cent\r\nFrom 10 to 20 inches  30.0 per cent\r\nFrom 20 to 40 inches  20.0 per cent\r\nFrom 40 to 60 inches  11.0 per cent\r\nFrom 60 to 80 inches   9.0 per cent\r\nFrom 100 to 120 inches 4.0 per cent\r\nFrom 120 to 160 inches 0.5 per cent\r\nAbove 160 inches       0.5 per cent\r\nTotal                  100 per cent\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty-five per cent, or more than one half of the total land surface\r\nof the earth, receives an annual precipitation of less than 20\r\ninches, and must be reclaimed, if at all, by dry-farming. At least\r\n10 per cent more receives from 20 to 30 inches under conditions that\r\nmake dry-farming methods necessary. A total of about 65 per cent of\r\nthe earth's land surface is, therefore, directly interested in\r\ndry-farming. With the future perfected development of irrigation\r\nsystems and practices, not more than 10 per cent will be reclaimed\r\nby irrigation. Dry-farming is truly a problem to challenge the\r\nattention of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDRY-FARM AREAS.--GENERAL CLIMATIC FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dry-farm territory of the United States stretches from the\r\nPacific seaboard to the 96th parallel of longitude, and from the\r\nCanadian to the Mexican boundary, making a total area of nearly\r\n1,800,000 square miles. This immense territory is far from being a\r\nvast level plain. On the extreme east is the Great Plains region of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley which is a comparatively uniform country of\r\nrolling hills, but no mountains. At a point about one third of the\r\nwhole distance westward the whole land is lifted skyward by the\r\nRocky Mountains, which cross the country from south to northwest.\r\nHere are innumerable peaks, canons, high table-lands, roaring\r\ntorrents, and quiet mountain valleys. West of the Rockies is the\r\ngreat depression known as the Great Basin, which has no outlet to\r\nthe ocean. It is essentially a gigantic level lake floor traversed\r\nin many directions by mountain ranges that are offshoots from the\r\nbackbone of the Rockies. South of the Great Basin are the high\r\nplateaus, into which many great chasms are cut, the best known and\r\nlargest of which is the great Canon of the Colorado. North and east\r\nof the Great Basin is the Columbia River Basin characterized by\r\nbasaltic rolling plains and broken mountain country. To the west,\r\nthe floor of the Great Basin is lifted up into the region of eternal\r\nsnow by the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which north of Nevada are known\r\nas the Cascades. On the west, the Sierra Nevadas slope gently,\r\nthrough intervening valleys and minor mountain ranges, into the\r\nPacific Ocean. It would be difficult to imagine a more diversified\r\ntopography than is possessed by the dry-farm territory of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nUniform climatic conditions are not to be expected over such a\r\nbroken country. The chief determining factors of climate--latitude,\r\nrelative distribution of land and water, elevation, prevailing\r\nwinds--swing between such large extremes that of necessity the\r\nclimatic conditions of different sections are widely divergent.\r\nDry-farming is so intimately related to climate that the typical\r\nclimatic variations must be pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe total annual precipitation is directly influenced by the land\r\ntopography, especially by the great mountain ranges. On the east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains is the sub-humid district, which receives from\r\n20 to 30 inches of rainfall annually; over the Rockies themselves,\r\nsemiarid conditions prevail; in the Great Basin, hemmed in by the\r\nRockies on the east and the Sierra Nevadas on the west, more arid\r\nconditions predominate; to the west, over the Sierras and down to\r\nthe seacoast, semiarid to sub-humid conditions are again found.\r\n\r\nSeasonal distribution of rainfall\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that the total annual precipitation is the\r\nchief factor in determining the success of dry-farming. However, the\r\ndistribution of the rainfall throughout the year is also of great\r\nimportance, and should be known by the farmer. A small rainfall,\r\ncoming at the most desirable season, will have greater\r\ncrop-producing power than a very much larger rainfall poorly\r\ndistributed. Moreover, the methods of tillage to be employed where\r\nmost of the precipitation comes in winter must be considerably\r\ndifferent from those used where the bulk of the precipitation comes\r\nin the summer. The successful dry-farmer must know the average\r\nannual precipitation, and also the average seasonal distribution of\r\nthe rainfall, over the land which he intends to dry-farm before he\r\ncan safely choose his cultural methods.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the monthly distribution of the precipitation over\r\nthe dry-farm territory of the United States, Henry of the United\r\nStates Weather Bureau recognizes five distinct types; namely: (1)\r\nPacific, (2) Sub-Pacific, (3) Arizona, (4) the Northern Rocky\r\nMountain and Eastern Foothills, and (5) the Plains Type:--\r\n\r\n_\"The Pacific Type.--_This type is found in all of the territory\r\nwest of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges, and also obtains in a\r\nfringe of country to the eastward of the mountain summits. The\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the Pacific type is a wet season,\r\nextending from October to March, and a practically rainless summer,\r\nexcept in northern California and parts of Oregon and Washington.\r\nAbout half of the yearly precipitation comes in the months of\r\nDecember, January, and February, the remaining half being\r\ndistributed throughout the seven months--September, October,\r\nNovember, March, April, May, and June.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Sub-Pacific Type.--_The term 'Sub-Pacific' has been given to that\r\ntype of rainfall which obtains over eastern Washington, Nevada, and\r\nUtah. The influences that control the precipitation of this region\r\nare much similar to those that prevail west of the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascade ranges. There is not, however, as in the eastern type, a\r\nsteady diminution in the precipitation with the approach of spring,\r\nbut rather a culmination in the precipitation.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Arizona Type.--_The Arizona Type, so called because it is more\r\nfully developed in that territory than elsewhere, prevails over\r\nArizona, New Mexico, and a small portion of eastern Utah and Nevada.\r\nThis type differs from all others in the fact that about 35 per cent\r\nof the rain falls in July and August. May and June are generally the\r\nmonths of least rainfall.\"\r\n\r\n_\"The Northern Rocky Mountain and Eastern Foothills Type.--_This\r\ntype is closely allied to that of the plains to the eastward, and\r\nthe bulk of the rain falls in the foothills of the region in April\r\nand May; in Montana, in May and June.\"\r\n\r\n_\"The Plains Type.--_This type embraces the greater part of the\r\nDakotas, Nebraska, Kansas; Oklahoma, the Panhandle of Texas, and all\r\nthe great corn and wheat states of the interior valleys. This region\r\nis characterized by a scant winter precipitation over the northern\r\nstates and moderately heavy rains during the growing season. The.\r\nbulk of the rains comes in May, June, and July.\"\r\n\r\nThis classification emphasizes the great variation in distribution\r\nof rainfall over the dry-farm territory of the country. West of the\r\nRocky Mountains the precipitation comes chiefly in winter and\r\nspring, leaving the summers rainless; while east of the Rockies, the\r\nwinters are somewhat rainless and the precipitation comes chiefly in\r\nspring and summer. The Arizona type stands midway between these\r\ntypes. This variation in the distribution of the rainfall requires\r\nthat different methods be employed in storing and conserving the\r\nrainfall for crop production. The adaptation of cultural methods to\r\nthe seasonal distribution of rainfall will be discussed hereafter.\r\n\r\nSnowfall\r\n\r\nClosely related to the distribution of the rainfall and the average\r\nannual temperature is the snowfall. Wherever a relatively large\r\nwinter precipitation occurs, the dry-farmer is benefited if it comes\r\nin the form of snow. The fall-planted seeds are better protected by\r\nthe snow; the evaporation is lower and it appears that the soil is\r\nimproved by the annual covering of snow. In any case, the methods of\r\nculture are in a measure dependent upon the amount of snowfall and\r\nthe length of time that it lies upon the ground.\r\n\r\nSnow falls over most of the dry-farm territory, excepting the\r\nlowlands of California, the immediate Pacific coast, and other\r\ndistricts where the average annual temperature is high. The heaviest\r\nsnowfall is in the intermountain district, from the west slope of\r\nthe Sierra Nevadas to the east slope of the Rockies. The degree of\r\nsnowfall on the agricultural lands is very variable and dependent\r\nupon local conditions. Snow falls upon all the high mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nTemperature\r\n\r\nWith the exceptions of portions of California, Arizona, and Texas\r\nthe average annual surface temperature of the dry-farm territory of\r\nthe United States ranges from 40 deg to 55 deg F. The average is not\r\nfar from 45 deg F. This places most of the dry-farm territory in the\r\nclass of cold regions, though a small area on the extreme east\r\nborder may be classed as temperate, and parts of California and\r\nArizona as warm. The range in temperature from the highest in summer\r\nto the lowest in winter is considerable, but not widely different\r\nfrom other similar parts of the United States. The range is greatest\r\nin the interior mountainous districts, and lowest along the\r\nseacoast. The daily range of the highest and lowest temperatures for\r\nany one day is generally higher over dry-farm sections than over\r\nhumid districts. In the Plateau regions of the semiarid country the\r\naverage daily variation is from 30 to 35 deg F., while east of the\r\nMississippi it is only about 20 deg F. This greater daily range is\r\nchiefly due to the clear skies and scant vegetation which facilitate\r\nexcessive warming by day and cooling by night.\r\n\r\nThe important temperature question for the dry-farmer is whether the\r\ngrowing season is sufficiently warm and long to permit the maturing\r\nof crops. There are few places, even at high altitudes in the region\r\nconsidered, where the summer temperature is so low as to retard the\r\ngrowth of plants. Likewise, the first and last killing frosts are\r\nordinarily so far apart as to allow an ample growing season. It must\r\nbe remembered that frosts are governed very largely by local\r\ntopographic features, and must be known from a local point of view.\r\nIt is a general law that frosts are more likely to occur in valleys\r\nthan on hillsides, owing to the downward drainage of the cooled air.\r\nFurther, the danger of frost increases with the altitude. In\r\ngeneral, the last killing frost in spring over the dry-farm\r\nterritory varies from March 15 to May 29, and the first killing\r\nfrost in autumn from September 15 to November 15. These limits\r\npermit of the maturing of all ordinary farm crops, especially the\r\ngrain crops.\r\n\r\nRelative humidity\r\n\r\nAt a definite temperature, the atmosphere can hold only a certain\r\namount of water vapor. When the air can hold no more, it is said to\r\nbe saturated. When it is not saturated, the amount of water vapor\r\nactually held by the air is expressed in percentages of the quantity\r\nrequired for saturation. A relative humidity of 100 per cent means\r\nthat the air is saturated; of 50 per cent, that it is only one half\r\nsaturated. The drier the air is, the more rapidly does the water\r\nevaporate into it. To the dry-farmer, therefore, the relative\r\nhumidity or degree of dryness of the air is of very great\r\nimportance. According to Professor Henry, the chief characteristics\r\nof the geographic distribution of relative humidity in the United\r\nStates are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Along the coasts there is a belt of high humidity at all\r\nseasons, the percentage of saturation ranging from 75 to 80 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n(2) Inland, from about the 70th meridian eastward to the Atlantic\r\ncoast, the amount varies between 70 and 75 per cent.\r\n\r\n(3) The dry region is in the Southwest, where the average annual\r\nvalue is not over 50 per cent. In this region are included Arizona,\r\nNew Mexico, western Colorado, and the greater portion of both Utah\r\nand Nevada. The amount of annual relative humidity in the remaining\r\nportion of the elevated district, between the 100th meridian on the\r\neast to the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades on the west, varies\r\nbetween 55 and 65 per cent. In July, August, and September, the mean\r\nvalues in the Southwest sink as low as 20 to 30 per cent, while\r\nalong the Pacific coast districts they continue about 80 per cent\r\nthe year round. In the Atlantic coast districts, and generally east\r\nfrom the Mississippi River, the variation from month to month is not\r\ngreat. April is probably the driest month of the year.\r\n\r\nThe air of the dry-farm territory, therefore, on the whole, contains\r\nconsiderably less than two thirds the amount of moisture carried by\r\nthe air of the humid states. This means that evaporation from plant\r\nleaves and soil surfaces will go on more rapidly in semiarid than in\r\nhumid regions. Against this danger, which cannot he controlled, the\r\ndry-farmer must take special precautions.\r\n\r\nSunshine\r\n\r\nThe amount of sunshine in a dry-farm section is also of importance.\r\nDirect sunshine promotes plant growth, but at the same time it\r\naccelerates the evaporation of water from the soil. The whole\r\ndry-farm territory receives more sunshine than do the humid\r\nsections. In fact, the amount of sunshine may roughly be said to\r\nincrease as the annual rainfall decreases. Over the larger part of\r\nthe arid and semiarid sections the sun shines over 70 per cent of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nWinds\r\n\r\nThe winds of any locality, owing to their moisture-dissipating\r\npower play an important part in the success of dry-farming. A\r\npersistent wind will offset much of the benefit of a heavy rainfall\r\nand careful cultivation. While great general laws have been\r\nformulated regarding the movements of the atmosphere, they are of\r\nminor value in judging the effect of wind on any farming district.\r\nLocal observations, however, may enable the farmer to estimate the\r\nprobable effect of the winds and thus to formulate proper cultural\r\nmeans of protection. In general, those living in a district are able\r\nto describe it without special observations as windy or quiet. In\r\nthe dry-farm territory of the United States the one great region of\r\nrelatively high and persistent winds is the Great Plains region east\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. Dry-farmers in that section will of\r\nnecessity be obliged to adopt cultural methods that will prevent the\r\nexcessive evaporation naturally induced by the unhindered wind, and\r\nthe possible blowing of well-tilled fallow land.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThe dry-farm territory is characterized by a low rainfall, averaging\r\nbetween 10 and 20 inches, the distribution of which falls into two\r\ndistinct types: a heavy winter and spring with a light summer\r\nprecipitation, and a heavy spring and summer with a light winter\r\nprecipitation. Snow falls over most of the territory, but does not\r\nlie long outside of the mountain states. The whole dry-farm\r\nterritory may be classed as temperate to cold; relatively high and\r\npersistent winds blow only over the Great Plains, though local\r\nconditions cause strong regular winds in many other places; the air\r\nis dry and the sunshine is very abundant. In brief, little water\r\nfalls upon the dry-farm territory, and the climatic factors are of a\r\nnature to cause rapid evaporation.\r\n\r\nIn view of this knowledge, it is not surprising that thousands of\r\nfarmers, employing, often carelessly agricultural methods developed\r\nin humid sections, have found only hardships and poverty on the\r\npresent dry-farm empire of the United States.\r\n\r\nDrouth\r\n\r\nDrouth is said to be the arch enemy of the dry-farmer, but few agree\r\nupon its meaning. For the purposes of this volume, drouth may be\r\ndefined as a condition under which crops fail to mature because of\r\nan insufficient supply of water. Providence has generally been\r\ncharged with causing drouths, but under the above definition, man is\r\nusually the cause. Occasionally, relatively dry years occur, but\r\nthey are seldom dry enough to cause crop failures if proper methods\r\nof farming have been practiced. There are four chief causes of\r\ndrouth: (1) Improper or careless preparation of the soil; (2)\r\nfailure to store the natural precipitation in the soil; (3) failure\r\nto apply proper cultural methods for keeping the moisture in the\r\nsoil until needed by plants, and (4) sowing too much seed for the\r\navailable soil-moisture.\r\n\r\nCrop failures due to untimely frosts, blizzards, cyclones,\r\ntornadoes, or hail may perhaps be charged to Providence, but the\r\ndry-farmer must accept the responsibility for any crop injury\r\nresulting from drouth. A fairly accurate knowledge of the climatic\r\nconditions of the district, a good understanding of the principles\r\nof agriculture without irrigation under a low rainfall, and a\r\nvigorous application of these principles as adapted to the local\r\nclimatic conditions will make dry-farm failures a rarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDRY-FARM SOILS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant as is the rainfall in making dry-farming successful, it is\r\nnot more so than the soils of the dry-farms. On a shallow soil, or\r\non one penetrated with gravel streaks, crop failures are probable\r\neven under a large rainfall; but a deep soil of uniform texture,\r\nunbroken by gravel or hardpan, in which much water may be stored,\r\nand which furnishes also an abundance of feeding space for the\r\nroots, will yield large crops even under a very small rainfall.\r\nLikewise, an infertile soil, though it be deep, and under a large\r\nprecipitation, cannot be depended on for good crops; but a fertile\r\nsoil, though not quite so deep, nor under so large a rainfall, will\r\nalmost invariably bring large crops to maturity.\r\n\r\nA correct understanding of the soil, from the surface to a depth of\r\nten feet, is almost indispensable before a safe Judgment can be\r\npronounced upon the full dry-farm possibilities of a district.\r\nEspecially is it necessary to know (a) the depth, (b) the uniformity\r\nof structure, and (c) the relative fertility of the soil, in order\r\nto plan an intelligent system of farming that will be rationally\r\nadapted to the rainfall and other climatic factors.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that so much of our information concerning\r\nthe soils of the dry-farm territory of the United States and other\r\ncountries has been obtained according to the methods and for the\r\nneeds of humid countries, and that, therefore, the special knowledge\r\nof our arid and semiarid soils needed for the development of\r\ndry-farming is small and fragmentary. What is known to-day\r\nconcerning the nature of arid soils and their relation to cultural\r\nprocesses under a scanty rainfall is due very largely to the\r\nextensive researches and voluminous writings of Dr. E. W. Hilgard,\r\nwho for a generation was in charge of the agricultural work of the\r\nstate of California. Future students of arid soils must of necessity\r\nrest their investigations upon the pioneer work done by Dr. Hilgard.\r\nThe contents of this chapter are in a large part gathered from\r\nHilgard's writings.\r\n\r\nThe formation of soils\r\n\r\n\"Soil is the more or less loose and friable material in which, by\r\nmeans of their roots, plants may or do find a foothold and\r\nnourishment, as well as other conditions of growth.\" Soil is formed\r\nby a complex process, broadly known as _weathering, _from the rocks\r\nwhich constitute the earth's crust. Soil is in fact only pulverized\r\nand altered rock. The forces that produce soil from rocks are of two\r\ndistinct classes, _physical and chemical. _The physical agencies of\r\nsoil production merely cause a pulverization of the rock; the\r\nchemical agencies, on the other hand, so thoroughly change the\r\nessential nature of the soil particles that they are no longer like\r\nthe rock from which they were formed.\r\n\r\nOf the physical agencies, _temperature changes _are first in order\r\nof time, and perhaps of first importance. As the heat of the day\r\nincreases, the rock expands, and as the cold night approaches,\r\ncontracts. This alternate expansion and contraction, in time, cracks\r\nthe surfaces of the rocks. Into the tiny crevices thus formed water\r\nenters from the falling snow or rain. When winter comes, the water\r\nin these cracks freezes to ice, and in so doing expands and widens\r\neach of the cracks. As these processes are repeated from day to day,\r\nfrom year to year, and from generation to generation, the surfaces\r\nof the rocks crumble. The smaller rocks so formed are acted upon by\r\nthe same agencies, in the same manner, and thus the process of\r\npulverization goes on.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the second great agency of soil formation,\r\nwhich always acts in conjunction with temperature changes, is\r\n_freezing water. _The rock particles formed in this manner are often\r\nwashed down into the mountain valleys, there caught by great rivers,\r\nground into finer dust, and at length deposited in the lower\r\nvalleys. _Moving water _thus becomes another physical agency of soil\r\nproduction. Most of the soils covering the great dry-farm territory\r\nof the United States and other countries have been formed in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn places, glaciers moving slowly down the canons crush and grind\r\ninto powder the rock over which they pass and deposit it lower down\r\nas soils. In other places, where strong winds blow with frequent\r\nregularity, sharp soil grains are picked up by the air and hurled\r\nagainst the rocks, which, under this action, are carved into\r\nfantastic forms. In still other places, the strong winds carry soil\r\nover long distances to be mixed with other soils. Finally, on the\r\nseashore the great waves dashing against the rocks of the coast\r\nline, and rolling the mass of pebbles back and forth, break and\r\npulverize the rock until soil is formed._ Glaciers, winds, _and\r\n_waves _are also, therefore, physical agencies of soil formation.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that the result of the action of all these agencies\r\nis to form a rock powder, each particle of which preserves the\r\ncomposition that it had while it was a constituent part of the rock.\r\nIt may further be noted that the chief of these soil-forming\r\nagencies act more vigorously in arid than in humid sections. Under\r\nthe cloudless sky and dry atmosphere of regions of limited rainfall,\r\nthe daily and seasonal temperature changes are much greater than in\r\nsections of greater rainfall. Consequently the pulverization of\r\nrocks goes on most rapidly in dry-farm districts. Constant heavy\r\nwinds, which as soil formers are second only to temperature changes\r\nand freezing water, are also usually more common in arid than in\r\nhumid countries. This is strikingly shown, for instance, on the\r\nColorado desert and the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe rock powder formed by the processes above described is\r\ncontinually being acted upon by agencies, the effect of which is to\r\nchange its chemical composition. Chief of these agencies is _water,\r\n_which exerts a solvent action on all known substances. Pure water\r\nexerts a strong solvent action, but when it has been rendered impure\r\nby a variety of substances, naturally occurring, its solvent action\r\nis greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe most effective water impurity, considering soil formation, is\r\nthe gas, _carbon dioxid. _This gas is formed whenever plant or\r\nanimal substances decay, and is therefore found, normally, in the\r\natmosphere and in soils. Rains or flowing water gather the carbon\r\ndioxid from the atmosphere and the soil; few natural waters are free\r\nfrom it. The hardest rock particles are disintegrated by carbonated\r\nwater, while limestones, or rocks containing lime, are readily\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nThe result of the action of carbonated water upon soil particles is\r\nto render soluble, and therefore more available to plants, many of\r\nthe important plant-foods. In this way the action of water, holding\r\nin solution carbon dioxid and other substances, tends to make the\r\nsoil more fertile.\r\n\r\nThe second great chemical agency of soil formation is the oxygen of\r\nthe air. Oxidation is a process of more or less rapid burning, which\r\ntends to accelerate the disintegration of rocks.\r\n\r\nFinally, the _plants _growing in soils are powerful agents of soil\r\nformation. First, the roots forcing their way into the soil exert a\r\nstrong pressure which helps to pulverize the soil grains; secondly,\r\nthe acids of the plant roots actually dissolve the soil, and third,\r\nin the mass of decaying plants, substances are formed, among them\r\ncarbon dioxid, that have the power of making soils more soluble.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that moisture, carbon dioxid, and vegetation, the\r\nthree chief agents inducing chemical changes in soils, are most\r\nactive in humid districts. While, therefore, the physical agencies\r\nof soil formation are most active in arid climates, the same cannot\r\nbe said of the chemical agencies. However, whether in arid or humid\r\nclimates, the processes of soil formation, above outlined, are\r\nessentially those of the \"fallow\" or resting-period given to\r\ndry-farm lands. The fallow lasts for a few months or a year, while\r\nthe process of soil formation is always going on and has gone on for\r\nages; the result, in quality though not in quantity, is the\r\nsame--the rock particles are pulverized and the plant-foods are\r\nliberated. It must be remembered in this connection that climatic\r\ndifferences may and usually do influence materially the character of\r\nsoils formed from one and the same kind of rock.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of arid soils\r\n\r\nThe net result of the processes above described Is a rock powder\r\ncontaining a great variety of sizes of soil grains intermingled with\r\nclay. The larger soil grains are called sand; the smaller, silt, and\r\nthose that are so small that they do not settle from quiet water\r\nafter 24 hours are known as clay.\r\n\r\nClay differs materially from sand and silt, not only in size of\r\nparticles, but also in properties and formation. It is said that\r\nclay particles reach a degree of fineness equal to 1/2500 of an\r\ninch. Clay itself, when wet and kneaded, becomes plastic and\r\nadhesive and is thus easily distinguished from sand. Because of\r\nthese properties, clay is of great value in holding together the\r\nlarger soil grains in relatively large aggregates which give soils\r\nthe desired degree of filth. Moreover, clay is very retentive of\r\nwater, gases, and soluble plant-foods, which are important factors\r\nin successful agriculture. Soils, in fact, are classified according\r\nto the amount of clay that they contain. Hilgard suggests the\r\nfollowing classification:--\r\n\r\n\r\nVery sandy soils      0.5 to 3 per cent clay\r\nOrdinary sandy soils  3.0 to 10 per cent clay\r\nSandy loams          10.0 to 15 per cent clay\r\nClay loams           15.0 to 25 per cent clay\r\nClay soils           25.0 to 35 per cent clay\r\nHeavy clay soils     35.0 per cent and over\r\n\r\n\r\nClay may be formed from any rock containing some form of _combined\r\nsilica _(quartz). Thus, granites and crystalline rocks generally,\r\nvolcanic rocks, and shales will produce clay if subjected to the\r\nproper climatic conditions. In the formation of clay, the extremely\r\nfine soil particles are attacked by the soil water and subjected to\r\ndeep-going chemical changes. In fact, clay represents the most\r\nfinely pulverized and most highly decomposed and hence in a measure\r\nthe most valuable portion of the soil. In the formation of clay,\r\nwater is the most active agent, and under humid conditions its\r\nformation is most rapid.\r\n\r\nIt follows that dry-farm soils formed under a more or less rainless\r\nclimate contain less clay than do humid soils. This difference is\r\ncharacteristic, and accounts for the statement frequently made that\r\nheavy clay soils are not the best for dry-farm purposes. The fact\r\nis, that heavy clay soils are very rare in arid regions; if found at\r\nall, they have probably been formed under abnormal conditions, as in\r\nhigh mountain valleys, or under prehistoric humid climates.\r\n\r\n_Sand.--_The sand-forming rocks that are not capable of clay\r\nproduction usually consist of _uncombined silica _or quartz, which\r\nwhen pulverized by the soil-forming agencies give a comparatively\r\nbarren soil. Thus it has come about that ordinarily a clayey soil is\r\nconsidered \"strong\" and a sandy soil \"weak.\" Though this distinction\r\nis true in humid climates where clay formation is rapid, it is not\r\ntrue in arid climates, where true clay is formed very slowly. Under\r\nconditions of deficient rainfall, soils are naturally less clayey,\r\nbut as the sand and silt particles are produced from rocks which\r\nunder humid conditions would yield clay, arid soils are not\r\nnecessarily less fertile.\r\n\r\nExperiment has shown that the fertility in the sandy soils of arid\r\nsections is as large and as available to plants as in the clayey\r\nsoils of humid regions. Experience in the arid section of America,\r\nin Egypt, India, and other desert-like regions has further proved\r\nthat the sands of the deserts produce excellent crops whenever water\r\nis applied to them. The prospective dry-farmer, therefore, need not\r\nbe afraid of a somewhat sandy soil, provided it has been formed\r\nunder arid conditions. In truth, a degree of sandiness is\r\ncharacteristic of dry-farm soils.\r\n\r\nThe _humus _content forms another characteristic difference between\r\narid and humid soils. In humid regions plants cover the soil\r\nthickly; in arid regions they are bunched scantily over the surface;\r\nin the former case the decayed remnants of generations of plants\r\nform a large percentage of humus in the upper soil; in the latter,\r\nthe scarcity of plant life makes the humus content low. Further,\r\nunder an abundant rainfall the organic matter in the soil rots\r\nslowly; whereas in dry warm climates the decay is very complete. The\r\nprevailing forces in all countries of deficient rainfall therefore\r\ntend to yield soils low in humus.\r\n\r\nWhile the total amount of humus in arid soils is very much lower\r\nthan in humid soils, repeated investigation has shown that it\r\ncontains about 3-1/2 times more nitrogen than is found in humus\r\nformed under an abundant rainfall. Owing to the prevailing sandiness\r\nof dry-farm soils, humus is not needed so much to give the proper\r\nfilth to the soil as in the humid countries where the content of\r\nclay is so much higher. Since, for dry-farm purposes, the nitrogen\r\ncontent is the most important quality of the humus, the difference\r\nbetween arid and humid soils, based upon the humus content, is not\r\nso great as would appear at first sight.\r\n\r\n_Soil and subsoil.--_In countries of abundant rainfall, a great\r\ndistinction exists between the soil and the subsoil. The soil is\r\nrepresented by the upper few inches which are filled with the\r\nremnants of decayed vegetable matter and modified by plowing,\r\nharrowing, and other cultural operations. The subsoil has been\r\nprofoundly modified by the action of the heavy rainfall, which, in\r\nsoaking through the soil, has carried with it the finest soil\r\ngrains, especially the clay, into the lower soil layers.\r\n\r\nIn time, the subsoil has become more distinctly clayey than the\r\ntopsoil. Lime and other soil ingredients have likewise been carried\r\ndown by the rains and deposited at different depths in the soil or\r\nwholly washed away. Ultimately, this results in the removal from the\r\ntopsoil of the necessary plant-foods and the accumulation in the\r\nsubsoil of the fine clay particles which so compact the subsoil as\r\nto make it difficult for roots and even air to penetrate it. The\r\nnormal process of weathering or soil disintegration will then go on\r\nmost actively in the topsoil and the subsoil will remain unweathered\r\nand raw. This accounts for the well-known fact that in humid\r\ncountries any subsoil that may have been plowed up is reduced to a\r\nnormal state of fertility and crop production only after several\r\nyears of exposure to the elements. The humid farmer, knowing this,\r\nis usually very careful not to let his plow enter the subsoil to any\r\ngreat depth.\r\n\r\nIn the arid regions or wherever a deficient rainfall prevails, these\r\nconditions are entirely reversed. The light rainfall seldom\r\ncompletely fills the soil pores to any considerable depth, but it\r\nrather moves down slowly as a him, enveloping the soil grains. The\r\nsoluble materials of the soil are, in part at least, dissolved and\r\ncarried down to the lower limit of the rain penetration, but the\r\nclay and other fine soil particles are not moved downward to any\r\ngreat extent. These conditions leave the soil and subsoil of\r\napproximately equal porosity. Plant roots can then penetrate the\r\nsoil deeply, and the air can move up and down through the soil mass\r\nfreely and to considerable depths. As a result, arid soils are\r\nweathered and made suitable for plant nutrition to very great\r\ndepths. In fact, in dry-farm regions there need be little talk about\r\nsoil and subsoil, since the soil is uniform in texture and usually\r\nnearly so in composition, from the top down to a distance of many\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nMany soil sections 50 or more feet in depth are exposed in the\r\ndry-farming territory of the United States, and it has often been\r\ndemonstrated that the subsoil to any depth is capable of producing,\r\nwithout further weathering, excellent yields of crops. This\r\ngranular, permeable structure, characteristic of arid soils, is\r\nperhaps the most important single quality resulting from rock\r\ndisintegration under arid conditions. As Hilgard remarks, it would\r\nseem that the farmer in the arid region owns from three to four\r\nfarms, one above the other, as compared with the same acreage in the\r\neastern states.\r\n\r\nThis condition is of the greatest importance in developing the\r\nprinciples upon which successful dry-farming rests. Further, it may\r\nbe said that while in the humid East the farmer must be extremely\r\ncareful not to turn up with his plow too much of the inert subsoil,\r\nno such fear need possess the western farmer. On the contrary, he\r\nshould use his utmost endeavor to plow as deeply as possible in\r\norder to prepare the very best reservoir for the falling waters and\r\na place for the development of plant roots.\r\n\r\n_Gravel seams.--_It need be said, however, that in a number of\r\nlocalities in the dry-farm territory the soils have been deposited\r\nby the action of running water in such a way that the otherwise\r\nuniform structure of the soil is broken by occasional layers of\r\nloose gravel. While this is not a very serious obstacle to the\r\ndownward penetration of roots, it is very serious in dry-farming,\r\nsince any break in the continuity of the soil mass prevents the\r\nupward movement of water stored in the lower soil depths. The\r\ndry-farmer should investigate the soil which he intends to use to a\r\ndepth of at least 8 to 10 feet to make sure, first of all, that he\r\nhas a continuous soil mass, not too clayey in the lower depths, nor\r\nbroken by deposits of gravel.\r\n\r\n_Hardpan.--_Instead of the heavy clay subsoil of humid regions, the\r\nso-called hardpan occurs in regions of limited rainfall. The annual\r\nrainfall, which is approximately constant, penetrates from year to\r\nyear very nearly to the same depth. Some of the lime found so\r\nabundantly in arid soils is dissolved and worked down yearly to the\r\nlower limit of the rainfall and left there to enter into combination\r\nwith other soil ingredients. Continued through long periods of time\r\nthis results in the formation of a layer of calcareous material at\r\nthe average depth to which the rainfall has penetrated the soil. Not\r\nonly is the lime thus carried down, but the finer particles are\r\ncarried down in like manner. Especially where the soil is poor in\r\nlime is the clay worked down to form a somewhat clayey hardpan. A\r\nhardpan formed in such a manner is frequently a serious obstacle to\r\nthe downward movement of the roots, and also prevents the annual\r\nprecipitation from moving down far enough to be beyond the influence\r\nof the sunshine and winds. It is fortunate, however, that in the\r\ngreat majority of instances this hardpan gradually disappears under\r\nthe influence of proper methods of dry-farm tillage. Deep plowing\r\nand proper tillage, which allow the rain waters to penetrate the\r\nsoil, gradually break up and destroy the hardpan, even when it is 10\r\nfeet below the surface. Nevertheless, the farmer should make sure\r\nwhether or not the hardpan does exist in the soil and plan his\r\nmethods accordingly. If a hardpan is present, the land must be\r\nfallowed more carefully every other year, so that a large quantity\r\nof water may be stored in the soil to open and destroy the hardpan.\r\n\r\nOf course, in arid as in humid countries, it often happens that a\r\nsoil is underlaid, more or less near the surface, by layers of rock,\r\nmarl deposits, and similar impervious or hurtful substances. Such\r\ndeposits are not to be classed with the hardpans that occur normally\r\nwherever the rainfall is small.\r\n\r\n_Leaching.--_Fully as important as any of the differences above\r\noutlined are those which depend definitely upon the leaching power\r\nof a heavy rainfall. In countries where the rainfall is 30 inches or\r\nover, and in many places where the rainfall is considerably less,\r\nthe water drains through the soil into the standing ground water.\r\nThere is, therefore, in humid countries, a continuous drainage\r\nthrough the soil after every rain, and in general there is a steady\r\ndownward movement of soil-water throughout the year. As is clearly\r\nshown by the appearance, taste, and chemical composition of drainage\r\nwaters, this process leaches out considerable quantities of the\r\nsoluble constituents of the soil.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil contains decomposing organic matter, such as roots,\r\nleaves, stalks, the gas carbon dioxid is formed, which, when\r\ndissolved in water, forms a solution of great solvent power. Water\r\npassing through well-cultivated soils containing much humus leaches\r\nout very much more material than pure water could do. A study of the\r\ncomposition of the drainage waters from soils and the waters of the\r\ngreat rivers shows that immense quantities of soluble soil\r\nconstituents are taken out of the soil in countries of abundant\r\nrainfall. These materials ultimately reach the ocean, where they are\r\nand have been concentrated throughout the ages. In short, the\r\nsaltiness of the ocean is due to the substances that have been\r\nwashed from the soils in countries of abundant rainfall.\r\n\r\nIn arid regions, on the other hand, the rainfall penetrates the soil\r\nonly a few feet. In time, it is returned to the surface by the\r\naction of plants or sunshine and evaporated into the air. It is true\r\nthat under proper methods of tillage even the light rainfall of arid\r\nand semiarid regions may he made to pass to considerable soil\r\ndepths, yet there is little if any drainage of water through the\r\nsoil into the standing ground water. The arid regions of the world,\r\ntherefore, contribute proportionately a small amount of the\r\nsubstances which make up the salt of the sea.\r\n\r\n_Alkali soils.--_Under favorable conditions it sometimes happens\r\nthat the soluble materials, which would normally be washed out of\r\nhumid soils, accumulate to so large a degree in arid soils as to\r\nmake the lands unfitted for agricultural purposes. Such lands are\r\ncalled alkali lands. Unwise irrigation in arid climates frequently\r\nproduces alkali spots, but many occur naturally. Such soils should\r\nnot be chosen for dry-farm purposes, for they are likely to give\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n_Plant-food content.--_This condition necessarily leads at once to\r\nthe suggestion that the soils from the two regions must differ\r\ngreatly in their fertility or power to produce and sustain plant\r\nlife. It cannot be believed that the water-washed soils of the East\r\nretain as much fertility as the dry soils of the West. Hilgard has\r\nmade a long and elaborate study of this somewhat difficult question\r\nand has constructed a table showing the composition of typical soils\r\nof representative states in the arid and humid regions. The\r\nfollowing table shows a few of the average results obtained by\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPartial Percentage Composition\r\n\r\nSource of soil             Humid  Arid\r\nNumber of samples analyzed 696    573\r\nInsoluble residue          84.17  69.16\r\nSoluble silica             4.04   6.71\r\nAlumina                    3.66   7.61\r\nLime                       0.13   1.43\r\nPotash                     0.21   0.67\r\nPhos. Acid                 0.12   0.16\r\nHumus                      1.22   1.13\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil chemists have generally attempted to arrive at a determination\r\nof the fertility of soil by treating a carefully selected and\r\nprepared sample with a certain amount of acid of definite strength.\r\nThe portion which dissolves under the influence of acids has been\r\nlooked upon as a rough measure of the possible fertility of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe column headed \"Insoluble Residue\" shows the average proportions\r\nof arid and humid soils which remain undissolved by acids. It is\r\nevident at once that the humid soils are much less soluble in acids\r\nthan arid soils, the difference being 84 to 69. Since the only\r\nplant-food in soils that may be used for plant production is that\r\nwhich is soluble, it follows that it is safe to assume that arid\r\nsoils are generally more fertile than humid soils. This is borne out\r\nby a study of the constituents of the soil. For instance, potash,\r\none of the essential plant foods ordinarily present in sufficient\r\namount, is found in humid soils to the extent of 0.21 per cent,\r\nwhile in arid soils the quantity present is 0.67 per cent, or over\r\nthree times as much. Phosphoric acid, another of the very important\r\nplant-foods, is present in arid soils in only slightly higher\r\nquantities than in humid soils. This explains the somewhat\r\nwell-known fact that the first fertilizer ordinarily required by\r\narid soils is some form of phosphorus:\r\n\r\nThe difference in the chemical composition of arid and humid soils\r\nis perhaps shown nowhere better than in the lime content. There is\r\nnearly eleven times more lime in arid than in humid soils.\r\nConditions of aridity favor strongly the formation of lime, and\r\nsince there is very little leaching of the soil by rainfall, the\r\nlime accumulates in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe presence of large quantities of lime in arid soils has a number\r\nof distinct advantages, among which the following are most\r\nimportant: (1) It prevents the sour condition frequently present in\r\nhumid climates, where much organic material is incorporated with the\r\nsoil. (2) When other conditions are favorable, it encourages\r\nbacterial life which, as is now a well-known fact, is an important\r\nfactor in developing and maintaining soil fertility. (3) By somewhat\r\nsubtle chemical changes it makes the relatively small percentages of\r\nother plant-foods notably phosphoric acid and potash, more available\r\nfor plant growth. (4) It aids to convert rapidly organic matter into\r\nhumus which represents the main portion of the nitrogen content of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nOf course, an excess of lime in the soil may be hurtful, though less\r\nso in arid than in humid regions. Some authors state that from 8 to\r\n20 per cent of calcium carbonate makes a soil unfitted for plant\r\ngrowth. There are, however, a great many agricultural soils covering\r\nlarge areas and yielding very abundant crops which contain very much\r\nlarger quantities of calcium carbonate. For instance, in the Sanpete\r\nValley of Utah, one of the most fertile sections of the Great Basin,\r\nagricultural soils often contain as high as 40 per cent of calcium\r\ncarbonate, without injury to their crop-producing power.\r\n\r\nIn the table are two columns headed \"Soluble Silica\" and \"Alumina,\"\r\nin both of which it is evident that a very much larger per cent is\r\nfound in the arid than in the humid soils. These soil constituents\r\nindicate the condition of the soil with reference to the\r\navailability of its fertility for plant use. The higher the\r\npercentage of soluble silica and alumina, the more thoroughly\r\ndecomposed, in all probability, is the soil as a whole and the more\r\nreadily can plants secure their nutriment from the soil. It will be\r\nobserved from the table, as previously stated, that more humus is\r\nfound in humid than in arid soils, though the difference is not so\r\nlarge as might be expected. It should be recalled, however, that the\r\nnitrogen content of humus formed under rainless conditions is many\r\ntimes larger than that of humus formed in rainy countries, and that\r\nthe smaller per cent of humus in dry-farming countries is thereby\r\noffset.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the composition of arid soils is very much more\r\nfavorable to plant growth than that of humid soils. As will be shown\r\nin Chapter IX, the greater fertility of arid soils is one of the\r\nchief reasons for dry-farming success. Depth of the soil alone does\r\nnot suffice. There must be a large amount of high fertility\r\navailable for plants in order that the small amount of water can be\r\nfully utilized in plant growth.\r\n\r\n_Summary of characteristics.--_Arid soils differ from humid soils in\r\nthat they contain: less clay; more sand, but of fertile nature\r\nbecause it is derived from rocks that in humid countries would\r\nproduce clay; less humus, but that of a kind which contains about\r\n3-1/2 times more nitrogen than the humus of humid soils; more lime,\r\nwhich helps in a variety of ways to improve the agricultural value\r\nof soils; more of all the essential plant-foods, because the\r\nleaching by downward drainage is very small in countries of limited\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nFurther, arid soils show no real difference between soil and\r\nsubsoil; they are deeper and more permeable; they are more uniform\r\nin structure; they have hardpans instead of clay subsoil, which,\r\nhowever, disappear under the influence of cultivation; their\r\nsubsoils to a depth of ten feet or more are as fertile as the\r\ntopsoil, and the availability of the fertility is greater. The\r\nfailure to recognize these characteristic differences between arid\r\nand humid soils has been the chief cause for many crop failures in\r\nthe more or less rainless regions of the world.\r\n\r\nThis brief review shows that, everything considered, arid soils are\r\nsuperior to humid soils. In ease of handling, productivity,\r\ncertainty of crop-lasting quality, they far surpass the soils of the\r\ncountries in which scientific agriculture was founded. As Hilgard\r\nhas suggested, the historical datum that the majority of the most\r\npopulous and powerful historical peoples of the world have been\r\nlocated on soils that thirst for water, may find its explanation in\r\nthe intrinsic value of arid soils. From Babylon to the United States\r\nis a far cry; but it is one that shouts to the world the superlative\r\nmerits of the soil that begs for water. To learn how to use the\r\n\"desert\" is to make it \"blossom like the rose.\"\r\n\r\nSoil divisions\r\n\r\nThe dry-farm territory of the United States may be divided roughly\r\ninto five great soil districts, each of which includes a great\r\nvariety of soil types, most of which are poorly known and mapped.\r\nThese districts are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Great Plains district.\r\n2. Columbia River district\r\n3. Great Basin district.\r\n4. Colorado River district.\r\n5. California district.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Plains district.--_On the eastern slope of the Rocky\r\nMountains, extending eastward to the extreme boundary of the\r\ndry-farm territory, are the soils of the High Plains and the Great\r\nPlains. This vast soil district belongs to the drainage basin of the\r\nMissouri, and includes North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,\r\nOklahoma, and parts of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,\r\nTexas, and Minnesota. The soils of this district are usually of high\r\nfertility. They have good lasting power, though the effect of the\r\nhigher rainfall is evident in their composition. Many of the\r\ndistinct types of the plains soils have been determined with\r\nconsiderable care by Snyder and Lyon, and may be found described in\r\nBailey's \"Cyclopedia of American Agriculture,\" Vol. I.\r\n\r\n_Columbia River district.--_The second great soil district of the\r\ndry-farming territory is located in the drainage basin of the\r\nColumbia River, and includes Idaho and the eastern two thirds of\r\nWashington and Oregon. The high plains of this soil district are\r\noften spoken of as the Palouse country. The soils of the western\r\npart of this district are of basaltic origin; over the southern part\r\nof Idaho the soils have been made from a somewhat recent lava flow\r\nwhich in many places is only a few feet below the surface. The soils\r\nof this district are generally of volcanic origin and very much\r\nalike. They are characterized by the properties which normally\r\nbelong to volcanic soils; somewhat poor in lime, but rich in potash\r\nand phosphoric acid. They last well under ordinary methods of\r\ntillage.\r\n\r\n_The Great Basin.--_The third great soil district is included in the\r\nGreat Basin, which covers nearly all of Nevada, half of Utah, and\r\ntakes small portions out of Idaho, Oregon, and southern California.\r\nThis basin has no outlet to the sea. Its rivers empty into great\r\nsaline inland lakes, the chief of which is the Great Salt Lake. The\r\nsizes of these interior lakes are determined by the amounts of water\r\nflowing into them and the rates of evaporation of the water into the\r\ndry air of the region.\r\n\r\nIn recent geological times, the Great Basin was filled with water,\r\nforming a vast fresh-water lake known as Lake Bonneville, which\r\ndrained into the Columbia River. During the existence of this lake,\r\nsoil materials were washed from the mountains into the lake and\r\ndeposited on the lake bottom. When at length, the lake disappeared,\r\nthe lake bottom was exposed and is now the farming lands of the\r\nGreat Basin district. The soils of this district are characterized\r\nby great depth and uniformity, an abundance of lime, and all the\r\nessential plant-foods with the exception of phosphoric acid, which,\r\nwhile present in normal quantities, is not unusually abundant. The\r\nGreat Basin soils are among the most fertile on the American\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n_Colorado River district.--_The fourth soil district lies in the\r\ndrainage basin of the Colorado River It includes much of the\r\nsouthern part of Utah, the eastern part of Colorado, part of New\r\nMexico, nearly all of Arizona, and part of southern California. This\r\ndistrict, in its northern part, is often spoken of as the High\r\nPlateaus. The soils are formed from the easily disintegrated rocks\r\nof comparatively recent geological origin, which themselves are said\r\nto have been formed from deposits in a shallow interior sea which\r\ncovered a large part of the West. The rivers running through this\r\ndistrict have cut immense canons with perpendicular walls which make\r\nmuch of this country difficult to traverse. Some of the soils are of\r\nan extremely fine nature, settling firmly and requiring considerable\r\ntillage before they are brought to a proper condition of tilth. In\r\nmany places the soils are heavily charged with calcium sulfate, or\r\ncrystals of the ordinary land plaster. The fertility of the soils,\r\nhowever, is high, and when they are properly cultivated, they yield\r\nlarge and excellent crops.\r\n\r\n_California district.--_The fifth soil district lies in California\r\nin the basin of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. The soils are\r\nof the typical arid kind of high fertility and great lasting powers.\r\nThey represent some of the most valuable dry-farm districts of the\r\nWest. These soils have been studied in detail by Hilgard.\r\n\r\n_Dry-farming in the five districts.--_It is interesting to note that\r\nin all of these five great soil districts dry-farming has been tried\r\nwith great success. Even in the Great Basin and the Colorado River\r\ndistricts, where extreme desert conditions often prevail and where\r\nthe rainfall is slight, it has been found possible to produce\r\nprofitable crops without irrigation. It is unfortunate that the\r\nstudy of the dry-farming territory of the United States has not\r\nprogressed far enough to permit a comprehensive and correct mapping\r\nof its soils. Our knowledge of this subject is, at the best,\r\nfragmentary. We know, however, with certainty that the properties\r\nwhich characterize arid soils, as described in this chapter' are\r\npossessed by the soils of the dry-farming territory, including the\r\nfive great districts just enumerated. The characteristics of arid id\r\nsoils increase as the rainfall decreases and other conditions of\r\naridity increase. They are less marked as we go eastward or westward\r\ntoward the regions of more abundant rainfall; that is to say, the\r\nmost highly developed arid soils are found in the Great Basin and\r\nColorado River districts. The least developed are on the eastern\r\nedge of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe judging of soils\r\n\r\nA chemical analysis of a soil, unless accompanied by a large amount\r\nof other information, is of little value to the farmer. The main\r\npoints in judging a prospective dry-farm are: the depth of the soil,\r\nthe uniformity of the soil to a depth of at least 10 feet, the\r\nnative vegetation, the climatic conditions as relating to early and\r\nlate frosts, the total annual rainfall and its distribution, and the\r\nkinds and yields of crops that have been grown in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the soil is best determined by the use of an auger. A\r\nsimple soil auger is made from the ordinary carpenter's auger, 1-1/2\r\nto 2 inches in diameter, by lengthening its shaft to 3 feet or more.\r\nWhere it is not desirable to carry sectional augers, it is often\r\nadvisable to have three augers made: one 3 feet, the other 6, and\r\nthe third 9 or 10 feet in length. The short auger is used first and\r\nthe others afterwards as the depth of the boring increases. The\r\nboring should he made in a large number of average\r\nplaces--preferably one boring or more on each acre if time and\r\ncircumstances permit--and the results entered on a map of the farm.\r\nThe uniformity of the soil is observed as the boring progresses. If\r\ngravel layers exist, they will necessarily stop the progress of the\r\nboring. Hardpans of any kind will also be revealed by such an\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe climatic information must be gathered from the local weather\r\nbureau and from older residents of the section.\r\n\r\nThe native vegetation is always an excellent index of dry-farm\r\npossibilities. If a good stand of native grasses exists, there can\r\nscarcely be any doubt about the ultimate success of dry-farming\r\nunder proper cultural methods. A healthy crop of sagebrush is an\r\nalmost absolutely certain indication that farming without irrigation\r\nis feasible. The rabbit brush of the drier regions is also usually a\r\ngood indication, though it frequently indicates a soil not easily\r\nhandled. Greasewood, shadscale, and other related plants ordinarily\r\nindicate heavy clay soils frequently charged with alkali. Such soils\r\nshould be the last choice for dry-farming purposes, though they\r\nusually give good satisfaction under systems of irrigation. If the\r\nnative cedar or other native trees grow in profusion, it is another\r\nindication of good dry-farm possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ROOT SYSTEMS OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great depth and high fertility of the soils of arid and semiarid\r\nregions have made possible the profitable production of agricultural\r\nplants under a rainfall very much lower than that of humid regions.\r\nTo make the principles of this system fully understood, it is\r\nnecessary to review briefly our knowledge of the root systems of\r\nplants growing under arid conditions.\r\n\r\nFunctions of roots\r\n\r\nThe roots serve at least three distinct uses or purposes: First,\r\nthey give the plant a foothold in the earth; secondly, they enable\r\nthe plant to secure from the soil the large amount of water needed\r\nin plant growth, and, thirdly, they enable the plant to secure the\r\nindispensable mineral foods which can be obtained only from the\r\nsoil. So important is the proper supply of water and food in the\r\ngrowth of a plant that, in a given soil, the crop yield is usually\r\nin direct proportion to the development of the root system. Whenever\r\nthe roots are hindered in their development, the growth of the plant\r\nabove ground is likewise retarded, and crop failure may result. The\r\nimportance of roots is not fully appreciated because they are hidden\r\nfrom direct view. Successful dry-farming consists, largely in the\r\nadoption of practices that facilitate a full and free development-of\r\nplant roots. Were it not that the nature of arid soils, as explained\r\nin preceding chapters, is such that full root development is\r\ncomparatively easy, it would probably be useless to attempt to\r\nestablish a system of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nKinds of roots\r\n\r\nThe root is the part of the plant that is found underground. It has\r\nnumerous branches, twigs, and filaments. The root which first forms\r\nwhen the seed bursts is known as the primary root. From this primary\r\nroot other roots develop, which are known as secondary roots. When\r\nthe primary root grows more rapidly than the secondary roots, the\r\nso-called taproot, characteristic of lucerne, clover, and similar\r\nplants, is formed. When, on the other hand, the taproot grows slowly\r\nor ceases its growth, and the numerous secondary roots grow long, a\r\nfibrous root system results, which is characteristic of the cereals,\r\ngrasses, corn, and other similar plants. With any type of root, the\r\ntendency of growth is downward; though under conditions that are not\r\nfavorable for the downward penetration of the roots the lateral\r\nextensions may be very large and near the surface\r\n\r\nExtent of roots\r\n\r\nA number of investigators have attempted to determine the weight of\r\nthe roots as compared with the weight of the plant above ground, hut\r\nthe subject, because of its great experimental difficulties, has not\r\nbeen very accurately explained. Schumacher, experimenting about\r\n1867, found that the roots of a well-established field of clover\r\nweighed as much as the total weight of the stems and leaves of the\r\nyear's crop, and that the weight of roots of an oat crop was 43 per\r\ncent of the total weight of seed and straw. Nobbe, a few years\r\nlater, found in one of his experiments that the roots of timothy\r\nweighed 31 per cent of the weight of the hay. Hosaeus, investigating\r\nthe same subject about the same time, found that the weight of roots\r\nof one of the brome grasses was as great as the weight of the part\r\nabove ground; of serradella, 77 per cent; of flax, 34 per cent; of\r\noats, 14 per cent; of barley, 13 per cent, and of peas, 9 per cent.\r\nSanborn, working at the Utah Station in 1893, found results very\r\nmuch the same\r\n\r\nAlthough these results are not concordant, they show that the weight\r\nof the roots is considerable, in many cases far beyond the belief of\r\nthose who have given the subject little or no attention. It may be\r\nnoted that on the basis of the figures above obtained, it is very\r\nprobable that the roots in one acre of an average wheat crop would\r\nweigh in the neighborhood of a thousand pounds--possibly\r\nconsiderably more. It should be remembered that the investigations\r\nwhich yielded the preceding results were all conducted in humid\r\nclimates and at a time when the methods for the study of the root\r\nsystems were poorly developed. The data obtained, therefore,\r\nrepresent, in all probability, minimum results which would be\r\nmaterially increased should the work be repeated now.\r\n\r\nThe relative weights of the roots and the stems and the leaves do\r\nnot alone show the large quantity of roots; the total lengths of the\r\nroots are even more striking. The German investigator, Nobbe, in a\r\nlaborious experiment conducted about 1867, added the lengths of all\r\nthe fine roots from each of various plants. He found that the total\r\nlength of roots, that is, the sum of the lengths of all the roots,\r\nof one wheat plant was about 268 feet, and that the total length of\r\nthe roots of one plant of rye was about 385 feet. King, of\r\nWisconsin, estimates that in one of his experiments, one corn plant\r\nproduced in the upper 3 feet of soil 1452 feet of roots. These\r\nsurprisingly large numbers indicate with emphasis the thoroughness\r\nwith which the roots invade the soil.\r\n\r\nDepth of root penetration\r\n\r\nThe earlier root studies did not pretend to determine the depth to\r\nwhich roots actually penetrate the earth. In recent years, however,\r\na number of carefully conducted experiments were made by the New\r\nYork, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Colorado, and especially the\r\nNorth Dakota stations to obtain accurate information concerning the\r\ndepth to which agricultural plants penetrate soils. It is somewhat\r\nregrettable, for the purpose of dry-farming, that these states, with\r\nthe exception of Colorado, are all in the humid or sub-humid area of\r\nthe United States. Nevertheless, the conclusions drawn from the work\r\nare such that they may be safely applied in the development of the\r\nprinciples of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nThere is a general belief among farmers that the roots of all\r\ncultivated crops are very near the surface and that few reach a\r\ngreater depth than one or two feet. The first striking result of the\r\nAmerican investigations was that every crop, without exception,\r\npenetrates the soil deeper than was thought possible in earlier\r\ndays. For example, it was found that corn roots penetrated fully\r\nfour feet into the ground and that they fully occupied all of the\r\nsoil to that depth.\r\n\r\nOn deeper and somewhat drier soils, corn roots went down as far as\r\neight feet. The roots of the small grains,--wheat, oats,\r\nbarley,--penetrated the soil from four to eight or ten feet. Various\r\nperennial grasses rooted to a depth of four feet the first year; the\r\nnext year, five and one half feet; no determinations were made of\r\nthe depth of the roots in later years, though it had undoubtedly\r\nincreased. Alfalfa was the deepest rooted of all the crops studied\r\nby the American stations. Potato roots filled the soil fully to a\r\ndepth of three feet; sugar beets to a depth of nearly four feet.\r\n\r\nSugar Beet Roots\r\n\r\nIn every case, under conditions prevailing in the experiments, and\r\nwhich did not have in mind the forcing of the roots down to\r\nextraordinary depths, it seemed that the normal depth of the roots\r\nof ordinary field crops was from three to eight feet. Sub-soiling\r\nand deep plowing enable the roots to go deeper into the soil. This\r\nwork has been confirmed in ordinary experience until there can be\r\nlittle question about the accuracy of the results.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of these results were obtained in humid climates on humid\r\nsoils, somewhat shallow, and underlain by a more or less infertile\r\nsubsoil. In fact, they were obtained under conditions really\r\nunfavorable to plant growth. It has been explained in Chapter V that\r\nsoils formed under arid or semiarid conditions are uniformly deep\r\nand porous and that the fertility of the subsoil is, in most cases,\r\npractically as great as of the topsoil. There is, therefore, in arid\r\nsoils, an excellent opportunity for a comparatively easy penetration\r\nof the roots to great depths and, because of the available\r\nfertility, a chance throughout the whole of the subsoil for ample\r\nroot development. Moreover, the porous condition of the soil permits\r\nthe entrance of air, which helps to purify the soil atmosphere and\r\nthereby to make the conditions more favorable for root development.\r\nConsequently it is to be expected that, in arid regions, roots will\r\nordinarily go to a much greater depth than in humid regions.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be remembered that roots are in constant search of\r\nfood and water and are likely to develop in the directions where\r\nthere is the greatest abundance of these materials. Under systems of\r\ndry-farming the soil water is stored more or less uniformly to\r\nconsiderable depths--ten feet or more--and in most cases the\r\npercentage of moisture in the spring and summer is as large or\r\nlarger some feet below the surface than in the upper two feet. The\r\ntendency of the root is, then, to move downward to depths where\r\nthere is a larger supply of water. Especially is this tendency\r\nincreased by the available soil fertility found throughout the whole\r\ndepth of the soil mass.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that in many of the irrigated sections the roots\r\ndo not penetrate the soil to great depths. This is true, because by\r\nthe present wasteful methods of irrigation the plant receives so\r\nmuch water at such untimely seasons that the roots acquire the habit\r\nof feeding very near the surface where the water is so lavishly\r\napplied. This means not only that the plant suffers more greatly in\r\ntimes of drouth, but that, since the feeding ground of the roots is\r\nsmaller, the crop is likely to be small.\r\n\r\nThese deductions as to the depth to which plant roots will penetrate\r\nthe soil in arid regions are fully corroborated by experiments and\r\ngeneral observation. The workers of the Utah Station have repeatedly\r\nobserved plant roots on dry-farms to a depth of ten feet. Lucerne\r\nroots from thirty to fifty feet in length are frequently exposed in\r\nthe gullies formed by the mountain torrents. Roots of trees,\r\nsimilarly, go down to great depths. Hilgard observes that he has\r\nfound roots of grapevines at a depth of twenty-two feet below the\r\nsurface, and quotes Aughey as having found roots of the native\r\nShepherdia in Nebraska to a depth of fifty feet. Hilgard further\r\ndeclares that in California fibrous-rooted plants, such as wheat and\r\nbarley, may descend in sandy soils from four to seven feet. Orchard\r\ntrees in the arid West, grown properly, are similarly observed to\r\nsend their roots down to great depths. In fact, it has become a\r\ncustom in many arid regions where the soils are easily penetrable to\r\nsay that the root system of a tree corresponds in extent and\r\nbranching to the part of the tree above ground.\r\n\r\nNow, it is to be observed that, generally, plants grown in dry\r\nclimates send their roots straight down into the soil; whereas in\r\nhumid climates, where the topsoil is quite moist and the subsoil is\r\nhard, roots branch out laterally and fill the upper foot or two of\r\nthe soil. A great deal has been said and written about the danger of\r\ndeep cultivation, because it tends to injure the roots that feed\r\nnear the surface. However true this may be in humid countries, it is\r\nnot vital in the districts primarily interested in dry-farming; and\r\nit is doubtful if the objection is as valid in humid countries as is\r\noften declared. True, deep cultivation, especially when performed\r\nnear the plant or tree, destroys the surface-feeding roots, but this\r\nonly tends to compel the deeper lying roots to make better use of\r\nthe subsoil.\r\n\r\nWhen, as in arid regions, the subsoil is fertile and furnishes a\r\nsufficient amount of water, destroying the surface roots is no\r\nhandicap whatever. On the contrary, in times of drouth, the\r\ndeep-lying roots feed and drink at their leisure far from the hot\r\nsun or withering winds, and the plants survive and arrive at rich\r\nmaturity, while the plants with shallow roots wither and die or are\r\nso seriously injured as to produce an inferior crop. Therefore, in\r\nthe system of dry-farming as developed in this volume, it must be\r\nunderstood that so far as the farmer has power, the roots must be\r\ndriven downward into the soil, and that no injury needs to be\r\napprehended from deep and vigorous cultivation.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief attempts of the dry-farmer must be to see to it\r\nthat the plants root deeply. This can be done only by preparing the\r\nright kind of seed-bed and by having the soil in its lower depths\r\nwell-stored with moisture, so that the plants may be invited to\r\ndescend. For that reason, an excess of moisture in the upper soil\r\nwhen the young plants are rooting is really an injury to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSTORING WATER IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large amount of water required for the production of plant\r\nsubstance is taken from the soil by the roots. Leaves and stems do\r\nnot absorb appreciable quantities of water. The scanty rainfall of\r\ndry-farm districts or the more abundant precipitation of humid\r\nregions must, therefore, be made to enter the soil in such a manner\r\nas to be readily available as soil-moisture to the roots at the\r\nright periods of plant growth.\r\n\r\nIn humid countries, the rain that falls during the growing season is\r\nlooked upon, and very properly, as the really effective factor in\r\nthe production of large crops. The root systems of plants grown\r\nunder such humid conditions are near the surface, ready to absorb\r\nimmediately the rains that fall, even if they do not soak deeply\r\ninto the soil. As has been shown in Chapter IV, it is only over a\r\nsmall portion of the dry-farm territory that the bulk of the scanty\r\nprecipitation occurs during the growing season. Over a large portion\r\nof the arid and semiarid region the summers are almost rainless and\r\nthe bulk of the precipitation comes in the winter, late fall, or\r\nearly spring when plants are not growing. If the rains that fall\r\nduring the growing season are indispensable in crop production, the\r\npossible area to be reclaimed by dry-farming will be greatly\r\nlimited. Even when much of the total precipitation comes in summer,\r\nthe amount in dry-farm districts is seldom sufficient for the proper\r\nmaturing of crops. In fact, successful dry-farming depends chiefly\r\nupon the success with which the rains that fall during any season of\r\nthe year may be stored and kept in the soil until needed by plants\r\nin their growth. The fundamental operations of dry-farming include a\r\nsoil treatment which enables the largest possible proportion of the\r\nannual precipitation to be stored in the soil. For this purpose, the\r\ndeep, somewhat porous soils, characteristic of arid regions, are\r\nunusually well adapted.\r\n\r\nAlway's demonstration\r\n\r\nAn important and unique demonstration of the possibility of bringing\r\ncrops to maturity on the moisture stored in the soil at the time of\r\nplanting has been made by Alway. Cylinders of galvanized iron, 6\r\nfeet long, were filled with soil as nearly as possible in its\r\nnatural position and condition Water was added until seepage began,\r\nafter which the excess was allowed to drain away. When the seepage\r\nhad closed, the cylinders were entirely closed except at the\r\nsurface. Sprouted grains of spring wheat were placed in the moist\r\nsurface soil, and 1 inch of dry soil added to the surface to prevent\r\nevaporation. No more water was added; the air of the greenhouse was\r\nkept as dry as possible. The wheat developed normally. The first ear\r\nwas ripe in 132 days after planting and the last in 143 days. The\r\nthree cylinders of soil from semiarid western Nebraska produced 37.8\r\ngrams of straw and 29 ears, containing 415 kernels weighing 11.188\r\ngrams. The three cylinders of soil from humid eastern Nebraska\r\nproduced only 11.2 grams of straw and 13 ears containing 114\r\nkernels, weighing 3 grams. This experiment shows conclusively that\r\nrains are not needed during the growing season, if the soil is well\r\nfilled with moisture at seedtime, to bring crops to maturity.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the rainfall?\r\n\r\nThe water that falls on the land is disposed of in three ways:\r\nFirst, under ordinary conditions, a large portion runs off without\r\nentering the soil; secondly, a portion enters the soil, but remains\r\nnear the surface, and is rapidly evaporated back into the air; and,\r\nthirdly, a portion enters the lower soil layers, from which it is\r\nremoved at later periods by several distinct processes. The run-off\r\nis usually large and is a serious loss, especially in dry-farming\r\nregions, where the absence of luxuriant vegetation, the somewhat\r\nhard, sun-baked soils, and the numerous drainage channels, formed by\r\nsuccessive torrents, combine to furnish the rains with an easy\r\nescape into the torrential rivers. Persons familiar with arid\r\nconditions know how quickly the narrow box canyons, which often\r\ndrain thousands of square miles, are filled with roaring water after\r\na comparatively light rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe run-off\r\n\r\nThe proper cultivation of the soil diminishes very greatly the loss\r\ndue to run-off, but even on such soils the proportion may often be\r\nvery great. Farrel observed at one of the Utah stations that during\r\na torrential rain--2.6 inches in 4 hours--the surface of the summer\r\nfallowed plats was packed so solid that only one fourth inch, or\r\nless than one tenth of the whole amount, soaked into the soil, while\r\non a neighboring stubble field, which offered greater hindrance to\r\nthe run-off, 1-1/2 inches or about 60 per cent were absorbed.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible under any condition to prevent the run-off\r\naltogether, although it can usually be reduced exceedingly. It is a\r\ncommon dry-farm custom to plow along the slopes of the farm instead\r\nof plowing up and down them. When this is done, the water which runs\r\ndown the slopes is caught by the succession of furrows and in that\r\nway the runoff is diminished. During the fallow season the disk and\r\nsmoothing harrows are run along the hillsides for the same purpose\r\nand with results that are nearly always advantageous to the\r\ndry-farmer. Of necessity, each man must study his own farm in order\r\nto devise methods that will prevent the run-off.\r\n\r\nThe structure of soils\r\n\r\nBefore examining more closely the possibility of storing water in\r\nsoils a brief review of the structure of soils is desirable. As\r\npreviously explained, soil is essentially a mixture of disintegrated\r\nrock and the decomposing remains of plants. The rock particles which\r\nconstitute the major portion of soils vary greatly in size. The\r\nlargest ones are often 500 times the sizes of the smallest. It would\r\ntake 50 of the coarsest sand particles, and 25,000 of the finest\r\nsilt particles, to form one lineal inch. The clay particles are\r\noften smaller and of such a nature that they cannot be accurately\r\nmeasured. The total number of soil particles in even a small\r\nquantity of cultivated soil is far beyond the ordinary limits of\r\nthought, ranging from 125,000 particles of coarse sand to\r\n15,625,000,000,000 particles of the finest silt in one cubic inch.\r\nIn other words, if all the particles in one cubic inch of soil\r\nconsisting of fine silt were placed side by side, they would form a\r\ncontinuous chain over a thousand miles long. The farmer, when he\r\ntills the soil, deals with countless numbers of individual soil\r\ngrains, far surpassing the understanding of the human mind. It is\r\nthe immense number of constituent soil particles that gives to the\r\nsoil many of its most valuable properties.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that no natural soil is made up of particles\r\nall of which are of the same size; all sizes, from the coarsest sand\r\nto the finest clay, are usually present. These particles of all\r\nsizes are not arranged in the soil in a regular, orderly way; they\r\nare not placed side by side with geometrical regularity; they are\r\nrather jumbled together in every possible way. The larger sand\r\ngrains touch and form comparatively large interstitial spaces into\r\nwhich the finer silt and clay grains filter. Then, again, the clay\r\nparticles, which have cementing properties, bind, as it were, one\r\nparticle to another. A sand grain may have attached to it hundreds,\r\nor it may be thousands, of the smaller silt grains; or a regiment of\r\nsmaller soil grains may themselves be clustered into one large grain\r\nby cementing power of the clay. Further, in the presence of lime and\r\nsimilar substances, these complex soil grains are grouped into yet\r\nlarger and more complex groups. The beneficial effect of lime is\r\nusually due to this power of grouping untold numbers of soil\r\nparticles into larger groups. When by correct soil culture the\r\nindividual soil grains are thus grouped into large clusters, the\r\nsoil is said to be in good tilth. Anything that tends to destroy\r\nthese complex soil grains, as, for instance, plowing the soil when\r\nit is too wet, weakens the crop-producing power of the soil. This\r\ncomplexity of structure is one of the chief reasons for the\r\ndifficulty of understanding clearly the physical laws governing\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nPore-space of soils\r\n\r\nIt follows from this description of soil structure that the soil\r\ngrains do not fill the whole of the soil space. The tendency is\r\nrather to form clusters of soil grains which, though touching at\r\nmany points, leave comparatively large empty spaces. This pore space\r\nin soils varies greatly, but with a maximum of about 55 per cent. In\r\nsoils formed under arid conditions the percentage of pore-space is\r\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 50 per cent. There are some arid\r\nsoils, notably gypsum soils, the particles of which are so uniform\r\nsize that the pore-space is exceedingly small. Such soils are always\r\ndifficult to prepare for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is the pore-space in soils that permits the storage of\r\nsoil-moisture; and it is always important for the farmer so to\r\nmaintain his soil that the pore-space is large enough to give him\r\nthe best results, not only for the storage of moisture, but for the\r\ngrowth and development of roots, and for the entrance into the soil\r\nof air, germ life, and other forces that aid in making the soil fit\r\nfor the habitation of plants. This can always be best accomplished,\r\nas will be shown hereafter, by deep plowing, when the soil is not\r\ntoo wet, the exposure of the plowed soil to the elements, the\r\nfrequent cultivation of the soil through the growing season, and the\r\nadmixture of organic matter. The natural soil structure at depths\r\nnot reached by the plow evidently cannot be vitally changed by the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nHygroscopic soil-water\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, a certain amount of water is always found\r\nin all things occurring naturally, soils included. Clinging to every\r\ntree, stone, or animal tissue is a small quantity of moisture\r\nvarying with the temperature, the amount of water in the air, and\r\nwith other well-known factors. It is impossible to rid any natural\r\nsubstance wholly of water without heating it to a high temperature.\r\nThis water which, apparently, belongs to all natural objects is\r\ncommonly called hygroscopic water. Hilgard states that the soils of\r\nthe arid regions contain, under a temperature of 15 deg C. and an\r\natmosphere saturated with water, approximately 5-1/2 per cent of\r\nhygroscopic water. In fact, however, the air over the arid region is\r\nfar from being saturated with water and the temperature is even\r\nhigher than 15 deg C., and the hygroscopic moisture actually found\r\nin the soils of the dry-farm territory is considerably smaller than\r\nthe average above given. Under the conditions prevailing in the\r\nGreat Basin the hygroscopic water of soils varies from .75 per cent\r\nto 3-1/2 per cent; the average amount is not far from 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the hygroscopic water of soils is of value in plant\r\ngrowth is a disputed question. Hilgard believes that the hygroscopic\r\nmoisture can be of considerable help in carrying plants through\r\nrainless summers, and further, that its presence prevents the\r\nheating of the soil particles to a point dangerous to plant roots.\r\nOther authorities maintain earnestly that the hygroscopic soil-water\r\nis practically useless to plants. Considering the fact that wilting\r\noccurs long before the hygroscopic water contained in the soil is\r\nreached, it is very unlikely that water so held is of any real\r\nbenefit to plant growth.\r\n\r\nGravitational water\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a portion of the water in the soil is under\r\nthe immediate influence of gravitation. For instance, a stone which,\r\nnormally, is covered with hygroscopic water is dipped into water The\r\nhydroscopic water is not thereby affected, but as the stone is drawn\r\nout of the water a good part of the water runs off. This is\r\ngravitational water That is, the gravitational water of soils is\r\nthat portion of the soil-water which filling the soil pores, flows\r\ndownward through the soil under the influence of gravity. When the\r\nsoil pores are completely filled, the maximum amount of\r\ngravitational water is found there. In ordinary dry-farm soils this\r\ntotal water capacity is between 35 and 40 per cent of the dry weight\r\nof soil.\r\n\r\nThe gravitational soil-water cannot long remain in that condition;\r\nfor, necessarily, the pull of gravity moves it downward through the\r\nsoil pores and if conditions are favorable, it finally reaches the\r\nstanding water-table, whence it is carried to the great rivers, and\r\nfinally to the ocean. In humid soils, under a large precipitation,\r\ngravitational water moves down to the standing water-table after\r\nevery rain. In dry-farm soils the gravitational water seldom reaches\r\nthe standing water-table; for, as it moves downward, it wets the\r\nsoil grains and remains in the capillary condition as a thin film\r\naround the soil grains.\r\n\r\nTo the dry-farmer, the full water capacity is of importance only as\r\nit pertains to the upper foot of soil. If, by proper plowing and\r\ncultivation, the upper soil be loose and porous, the precipitation\r\nis allowed to soak quickly into the soil, away from the action of\r\nthe wind and sun. From this temporary reservoir, the water, in\r\nobedience to the pull of gravity, will move slowly downward to the\r\ngreater soil depths, where it will be stored permanently until\r\nneeded by plants. It is for this reason that dry-farmers find it\r\nprofitable to plow in the fall, as soon as possible after\r\nharvesting. In fact, Campbell advocates that the harvester be\r\nfollowed immediately by the disk, later to be followed by the plow\r\nThe essential thing is to keep the topsoil open and receptive to a\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nCapillary soil-water\r\n\r\nThe so-called capillary soil-water is of greatest importance to the\r\ndry-farmer. This is the water that clings as a film around a marble\r\nthat has been dipped into water. There is a natural attraction\r\nbetween water and nearly all known substances, as is witnessed by\r\nthe fact that nearly all things may be moistened. The water is held\r\naround the marble because the attraction between the marble and the\r\nwater is greater than the pull of gravity upon the water. The\r\ngreater the attraction, the thicker the film; the smaller the\r\nattraction, the thinner the film will be. The water that rises in a\r\ncapillary glass tube when placed in water does so by virtue of the\r\nattraction between water and glass. Frequently, the force that makes\r\ncapillary water possible is called surface tension.\r\n\r\nWhenever there is a sufficient amount of water available, a thin\r\nfilm of water is found around every soil grain; and where the soil\r\ngrains touch, or where they are very near together, water is held\r\npretty much as in capillary tubes. Not only are the soil particles\r\nenveloped by such a film, but the plant roots foraging in the soil\r\nare likewise covered; that is, the whole system of soil grains and\r\nroots is covered, under favorable conditions, with a thin film of\r\ncapillary water. It is the water in this form upon which plants draw\r\nduring their periods of growth. The hygroscopic water and the\r\ngravitational water are of comparatively little value in plant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nField capacity of soils for capillary water\r\n\r\nThe tremendously large number of soil grains found in even a small\r\namount of soil makes it possible for the soil to hold very large\r\nquantities of capillary water. To illustrate: In one cubic inch of\r\nsand soil the total surface exposed by the soil grains varies from\r\n42 square inches to 27 square feet; in one cubic inch of silt soil,\r\nfrom 27 square feet to 72 square feet, and in one cubic inch of an\r\nordinary soil the total surface exposed by the soil grains is about\r\n25 square feet. This means that the total surface of the soil grains\r\ncontained in a column of soil 1 square foot at the top and 10 feet\r\ndeep is approximately 10 acres. When even a thin film of water is\r\nspread over such a large area, it is clear that the total amount of\r\nwater involved must be large It is to be noticed, therefore, that\r\nthe fineness of the soil particles previously discussed has a direct\r\nbearing upon the amount of water that soils may retain for the use\r\nof plant growth. As the fineness of the soil grains increases, the\r\ntotal surface increases' and the water-holding capacity also\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the thickness of a water film held around the soil grains\r\nis very minute. King has calculated that a film 275 millionths of an\r\ninch thick, clinging around the soil particles, is equivalent to\r\n14.24 per cent of water in a heavy clay; 7.2 per cent in a loam;\r\n5.21 per cent in a sandy loam, and 1.41 per cent in a sandy soil.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know the largest amount of water that soils can\r\nhold in a capillary condition, for upon it depend, in a measure, the\r\npossibilities of crop production under dry-farming conditions. King\r\nstates that the largest amount of capillary water that can be held\r\nin sandy loams varies from 17.65 per cent to 10.67 per cent; in clay\r\nloams from 22.67 per cent to 18.16 per cent, and in humus soils\r\n(which are practically unknown in dry-farm sections) from 44.72 per\r\ncent to 21.29 per cent. These results were not obtained under\r\ndry-farm conditions and must be confirmed by investigations of arid\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nThe water that falls upon dry-farms is very seldom sufficient in\r\nquantity to reach the standing water-table, and it is necessary,\r\ntherefore, to determine the largest percentage of water that a soil\r\ncan hold under the influence of gravity down to a depth of 8 or 10\r\nfeet--the depth to which the roots penetrate and in which root\r\naction is distinctly felt. This is somewhat difficult to determine\r\nbecause the many conflicting factors acting upon the soil-water are\r\nseldom in equilibrium. Moreover, a considerable time must usually\r\nelapse before the rain-water is thoroughly distributed throughout\r\nthe soil. For instance, in sandy soils, the downward descent of\r\nwater is very rapid; in clay soils, where the preponderance of fine\r\nparticles makes minute soil pores, there is considerable hindrance\r\nto the descent of water, and it may take weeks or months for\r\nequilibrium to be established. It is believed that in a dry-farm\r\ndistrict, where the major part of the precipitation comes during\r\nwinter, the early springtime, before the spring rains come, is the\r\nbest time for determining the maximum water capacity of a soil. At\r\nthat season the water-dissipating influences, such as sunshine and\r\nhigh temperature, are at a minimum, and a sufficient time has\r\nelapsed to permit the rains of fall and winter to distribute\r\nthemselves uniformly throughout the soil. In districts of high\r\nsummer precipitation, the late fall after a fallow season will\r\nprobably be the best time for the determination of the field-water\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nExperiments on this subject have been conducted at the Utah Station.\r\nAs a result of several thousand trials it was found that, in the\r\nspring, a uniform, sandy loam soil of true arid properties\r\ncontained, from year to year, an average of nearly 16-1/2 per cent\r\nof water to a depth of 8 feet. This appeared to be practically the\r\nmaximum water capacity of that soil under field conditions, and it\r\nmay be called the field capacity of that soil for capillary water.\r\nOther experiments on dry-farms showed the field capacity of a clay\r\nsoil to a depth of 8 feet to be 19 per cent; of a clay loam, to be\r\n18 per cent; of a loam, 17 per cent; of another loam somewhat more\r\nsandy, 16 per cent; of a sandy loam, 14-1/2 per cent; and of a very\r\nsandy loam, 14 per cent. Leather found that in the calcareous arid\r\nsoil of India the upper 5 feet contained 18 per cent of water at the\r\nclose of the wet season.\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded, therefore, that the field-water capacities of\r\nordinary dry-farm soils are not very high, ranging from 15 to 20 per\r\ncent, with an average for ordinary dry-farm soils in the\r\nneighborhood of 16 or 17 per cent. Expressed in another way this\r\nmeans that a layer of water from 2 to 3 inches deep can be stored in\r\nthe soil to a depth of 12 inches. Sandy soils will hold less water\r\nthan clayey ones. It must not be forgotten that in the dry-farm\r\nregion are numerous types of soils, among them some consisting\r\nchiefly of very fine soil grains and which would; consequently,\r\npossess field-water capacities above the average here stated. The\r\nfirst endeavor of the dry-farmer should be to have the soil filled\r\nto its full field-water capacity before a crop is planted.\r\n\r\nDownward movement of soil-moisture\r\n\r\nOne of the chief considerations in a discussion of the storing of\r\nwater in soils is the depth to which water may move under ordinary\r\ndry-farm conditions. In humid regions, where the water table is near\r\nthe surface and where the rainfall is very abundant, no question has\r\nbeen raised concerning the possibility of the descent of water\r\nthrough the soil to the standing water. Considerable objection,\r\nhowever, has been offered to the doctrine that the rainfall of arid\r\ndistricts penetrates the soil to any great extent. Numerous writers\r\non the subject intimate that the rainfall under dry-farm conditions\r\nreaches at the best the upper 3 or 4 feet of soil. This cannot be\r\ntrue, for the deep rich soils of the arid region, which never have\r\nbeen disturbed by the husbandman, are moist to very great depths. In\r\nthe deserts of the Great Basin, where vegetation is very scanty,\r\nsoil borings made almost anywhere will reveal the fact that moisture\r\nexists in considerable quantities to the full depth of the ordinary\r\nsoil auger, usually 10 feet. The same is true for practically every\r\ndistrict of the arid region.\r\n\r\nSuch water has not come from below, for in the majority of cases the\r\nstanding water is 50 to 500 feet below the surface. Whitney made\r\nthis observation many years ago and reported it as a striking\r\nfeature of agriculture in arid regions, worthy of serious\r\nconsideration. Investigations made at the Utah Station have shown\r\nthat undisturbed soils within the Great Basin frequently contain, to\r\na depth of 10 feet, an amount of water equivalent to 2 or 3 years of\r\nthe rainfall which normally occurs in that locality. These\r\nquantities of water could not be found in such soils, unless, under\r\narid conditions, water has the power to move downward to\r\nconsiderably greater depths than is usually believed by dry-farmers.\r\n\r\nIn a series of irrigation experiments conducted at the Utah Station\r\nit was demonstrated that on a loam soil, within a few hours after an\r\nirrigation, some of the water applied had reached the eighth foot,\r\nor at least had increased the percentage of water in the eighth\r\nfoot. In soil that was already well filled with water, the addition\r\nof water was felt distinctly to the full depth of 8 feet. Moreover,\r\nit was observed in these experiments that even very small rains\r\ncaused moisture changes to considerable depths a few hours after the\r\nrain was over. For instance, 0.14 of an inch of rainfall was felt to\r\na depth of 2 feet within 3 hours; 0.93 of an inch was felt to a\r\ndepth of 3 feet within the same period.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether or not the natural winter precipitation, upon\r\nwhich the crops of a large portion of the dry-farm territory depend,\r\npenetrates the soil to any great depth a series of tests were\r\nundertaken. At the close of the harvest in August or September the\r\nsoil was carefully sampled to a depth of 8 feet, and in the\r\nfollowing spring similar samples were taken on the same soils to the\r\nsame depth. In every case, it was found that the winter\r\nprecipitation had caused moisture changes to the full depth reached\r\nby the soil auger. Moreover, these changes were so great as to lead\r\nthe investigators to believe that moisture changes had occurred to\r\ngreater depths.\r\n\r\nIn districts where the major part of the precipitation occurs during\r\nthe summer the same law is undoubtedly in operation; but, since\r\nevaporation is most active in the summer, it is probable that a\r\nsmaller proportion reaches the greater soil depths. In the Great\r\nPlains district, therefore, greater care will have to be exercised\r\nduring the summer in securing proper water storage than in the Great\r\nBasin, for instance. The principle is, nevertheless, the same. Burr,\r\nworking under Great Plains conditions in Nebraska, has shown that\r\nthe spring and summer rains penetrate the soil to the depth of 6\r\nfeet, the average depth of the borings, and that it undoubtedly\r\naffects the soil-moisture to the depth of 10 feet. In general, the\r\ndry-farmer may safely accept the doctrine that the water that falls\r\nupon his land penetrates the soil far beyond the immediate reach of\r\nthe sun, though not so far away that plant roots cannot make use of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nImportance of a moist subsoil\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the downward movement of soil-water it is to\r\nbe noted that it is only when the soil is tolerably moist that the\r\nnatural precipitation moves rapidly and freely to the deeper soil\r\nlayers. When the soil is dry, the downward movement of the water is\r\nmuch slower and the bulk of the water is then stored near the\r\nsurface where the loss of moisture goes on most rapidly. It has been\r\nobserved repeatedly in the investigations at the Utah Station that\r\nwhen desert land is broken for dry-farm purposes and then properly\r\ncultivated, the precipitation penetrates farther and farther into\r\nthe soil with every year of cultivation. For example, on a dry-farm,\r\nthe soil of which is clay loam, and which was plowed in the fall of\r\n1904 and farmed annually thereafter, the eighth foot contained in\r\nthe spring of 1905, 6.59 per cent of moisture; in the spring of\r\n1906, 13.11 per cent, and in the spring of 1907, 14.75 per cent of\r\nmoisture. On another farm, with a very sandy soil and also plowed in\r\nthe fall of 1904, there was found in the eighth foot in the spring\r\nof 1905, 5.63 per cent of moisture, in the spring of 1906, 11.41 per\r\ncent of moisture, and in the spring of 1907, 15.49 per cent of\r\nmoisture. In both of these typical cases it is evident that as the\r\ntopsoil was loosened, the full field water capacity of the soil was\r\nmore nearly approached to a greater depth. It would seem that, as\r\nthe lower soil layers are moistened, the water is enabled, so to\r\nspeak, to slide down more easily into the depths of the soil.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important principle for the dry farmer to understand.\r\nIt is always dangerous to permit the soil of a dry-farm to become\r\nvery dry, especially below the first foot. Dry-farms should be so\r\nmanipulated that even at the harvesting season a comparatively large\r\nquantity of water remains in the soil to a depth of 8 feet or more.\r\nThe larger the quantity of water in the soil in the fall, the more\r\nreadily and quickly will the water that falls on the land during the\r\nresting period of fall, winter, and early spring sink into the soil\r\nand move away from the topsoil. The top or first foot will always\r\ncontain the largest percentage of water because it is the chief\r\nreceptacle of the water that falls as rain or snow but when the\r\nsubsoil is properly moist, the water will more completely leave the\r\ntopsoil. Further, crops planted on a soil saturated with water to a\r\ndepth of 8 feet are almost certain to mature and yield well.\r\n\r\nIf the field-water capacity has not been filled, there is always the\r\ndanger that an unusually dry season or a series of hot winds or\r\nother like circumstances may either seriously injure the crop or\r\ncause a complete failure. The dry-farmer should keep a surplus of\r\nmoisture in the soil to be carried over from year to year, just as\r\nthe wise business man maintains a sufficient working capital for the\r\nneeds of his business. In fact, it is often safe to advise the\r\nprospective dry-farmer to plow his newly cleared or broken land\r\ncarefully and then to grow no crop on it the first year, so that,\r\nwhen crop production begins, the soil will have stored in it an\r\namount of water sufficient to carry a crop over periods of drouth.\r\nEspecially in districts of very low rainfall is this practice to be\r\nrecommended. In the Great Plains area, where the summer rains tempt\r\nthe farmer to give less attention to the soil-moisture problem than\r\nin the dry districts with winter precipitation farther West, it is\r\nimportant that a fallow season be occasionally given the land to\r\nprevent the store of soil moisture from becoming dangerously low.\r\n\r\nTo what extent is the rainfall stored in soils?\r\n\r\nWhat proportion of the actual amount of water falling upon the soil\r\ncan be stored in the soil and carried over from season to season?\r\nThis question naturally arises in view of the conclusion that water\r\npenetrates the soil to considerable depths. There is comparatively\r\nlittle available information with which to answer this question,\r\nbecause the great majority of students of soil moisture have\r\nconcerned themselves wholly with the upper two, three, or four feet\r\nof soil. The results of such investigations are practically useless\r\nin answering this question. In humid regions it may be very\r\nsatisfactory to confine soil-moisture investigations to the upper\r\nfew feet; but in arid regions, where dry-farming is a living\r\nquestion, such a method leads to erroneous or incomplete\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nSince the average field capacity of soils for water is about 2.5\r\ninches per foot, it follows that it is possible to store 25 inches\r\nof water in 10 feet of soil. This is from two to one and a half\r\ntimes one year's rainfall over the better dry-farming sections.\r\nTheoretically, therefore, there is no reason why the rainfall of one\r\nseason or more could not be stored in the soil. Careful\r\ninvestigations have borne out this theory. Atkinson found, for\r\nexample, at the Montana Station, that soil, which to a depth of 9\r\nfeet contained 7.7 per cent of moisture in the fall contained 11.5\r\nper cent in the spring and, after carrying it through the summer by\r\nproper methods of cultivation, 11 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt may certainly be concluded from this experiment that it is\r\npossible to carry over the soil moisture from season to season. The\r\nelaborate investigations at the Utah Station have demonstrated that\r\nthe winter precipitation, that is, the precipitation that comes\r\nduring the wettest period of the year, may be retained in a large\r\nmeasure in the soil. Naturally, the amount of the natural\r\nprecipitation accounted for in the upper eight feet will depend upon\r\nthe dryness of the soil at the time the investigation commenced. If\r\nat the beginning of the wet season the upper eight feet of soil are\r\nfairly well stored with moisture, the precipitation will move down\r\nto even greater depths, beyond the reach of the soil auger. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the soil is comparatively dry at the beginning of\r\nthe season, the natural precipitation will distribute itself through\r\nthe upper few feet, and thus be readily measured by the soil auger.\r\n\r\nIn the Utah investigations it was found that of the water which fell\r\nas rain and snow during the winter, as high as 95-1/2 per cent was\r\nfound stored in the first eight feet of soil at the beginning of the\r\ngrowing season. Naturally, much smaller percentages were also found,\r\nbut on an average, in soils somewhat dry at the beginning of the dry\r\nseason, more than three fourths of the natural precipitation was\r\nfound stored in the soil in the spring. The results were all\r\nobtained in a locality where the bulk of the precipitation comes in\r\nthe winter, yet similar results would undoubtedly be obtained where\r\nthe precipitation occurs mainly in the summer. The storage of water\r\nin the soil cannot be a whit less important on the Great Plains than\r\nin the Great Basin. In fact, Burr has clearly demonstrated for\r\nwestern Nebraska that over 50 per cent of the rainfall of the spring\r\nand summer may be stored in the soil to the depth of six feet.\r\nWithout question, some is stored also at greater depths.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence at hand shows that a large portion of the\r\nprecipitation falling upon properly prepared soil, whether it be\r\nsummer or winter, is stored in the soil until evaporation is allowed\r\nto withdraw it Whether or not water so stored may be made to remain\r\nin the soil throughout the season or the year will be discussed in\r\nthe next chapter. It must be said, however, that the possibility of\r\nstoring water in the soil, that is, making the water descend to\r\nrelatively great soil depths away from the immediate and direct\r\naction of the sunshine and winds, is the most fundamental principle\r\nin successful dry-farming.\r\n\r\nThe fallow\r\n\r\nIt may be safely concluded that a large portion of the water that\r\nfalls as rain or snow may be stored in the soil to considerable\r\ndepths (eight feet or more). However, the question remains, Is it\r\npossible to store the rainfall of successive years in the soil for\r\nthe use of one crop? In short, Does the practice of clean fallowing\r\nor resting the ground with proper cultivation for one season enable\r\nthe farmer to store in the soil the larger portion of the rainfall\r\nof two years, to be used for one crop? It is unquestionably true, as\r\nwill be shown later, that clean fallowing or \"summer tillage\" is one\r\nof the oldest and safest practices of dry-farming as practiced in\r\nthe West, but it is not generally understood why fallowing is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nConsiderable doubt has recently been cast upon the doctrine that one\r\nof the beneficial effects of fallowing in dry-farming is to store\r\nthe rainfall of successive seasons in the soil for the use of one\r\ncrop. Since it has been shown that a large proportion of the winter\r\nprecipitation can be stored in the soil during the wet season, it\r\nmerely becomes a question of the possibility of preventing the\r\nevaporation of this water during the drier season. As will be shown\r\nin the next chapter, this can well be effected by proper\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason, therefore, for believing that the\r\nprecipitation of successive seasons may not be added to water\r\nalready stored in the soil. King has shown that fallowing the soil\r\none year carried over per square foot, in the upper four feet, 9.38\r\npounds of water more than was found in a cropped soil in a parallel\r\nexperiment; and, moreover, the beneficial effect of this. water\r\nadvantage was felt for a whole succeeding season. King concludes,\r\ntherefore, that one of the advantages of fallowing is to increase\r\nthe moisture content of the soil. The Utah experiments show that the\r\ntendency of fallowing is always to increase the soil-moisture\r\ncontent. In dry-farming, water is the critical factor, and any\r\npractice that helps to conserve water should be adopted. For that\r\nreason, fallowing, which gathers soil-moisture, should be strongly\r\nadvocated. In Chapter IX another important value of the fallow will\r\nbe discussed.\r\n\r\nIn view of the discussion in this chapter it is easily understood\r\nwhy students of soil-moisture have not found a material increase in\r\nsoil-moisture due to fallowing. Usually such investigations have\r\nbeen made to shallow depths which already were fairly well filled\r\nwith moisture. Water falling upon such soils would sink beyond the\r\ndepth reached by the soil augers, and it became impossible to judge\r\naccurately of the moisture-storing advantage of the fallow. A\r\ncritical analysis of the literature on this subject will reveal the\r\nweakness of most experiments in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that the only fallow that should be\r\npracticed by the dry-farmer is the clean fallow. Water storage is\r\nmanifestly impossible when crops are growing upon a soil. A healthy\r\ncrop of sagebrush, sunflowers, or other weeds consumes as much water\r\nas a first-class stand of corn, wheat, or potatoes. Weeds should be\r\nabhorred by the farmer. A weedy fallow is a sure forerunner of a\r\ncrop failure. How to maintain a good fallow is discussed in Chapter\r\nVIII, under the head of Cultivation. Moreover, the practice of\r\nfallowing should be varied with the climatic conditions. In\r\ndistricts of low rainfall, 10-15 inches, the land should be clean\r\nsummer-fallowed every other year; under very low rainfall perhaps\r\neven two out of three years; in districts of more abundant rainfall,\r\n15-20 inches, perhaps one year out of every three or four is\r\nsufficient. Where the precipitation comes during the growing season,\r\nas in the Great Plains area, fallowing for the storage of water is\r\nless important than where the major part of the rainfall comes\r\nduring the fall and winter. However, any system of dry-farming that\r\nomits fallowing wholly from its practices is in danger of failure in\r\ndry years.\r\n\r\nDeep plowing for water storage\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted in this chapter to demonstrate that water\r\nfalling upon a soil may descend to great depths, and may be stored\r\nin the soil from year to year, subject to the needs of the crop that\r\nmay be planted. By what cultural treatment may this downward descent\r\nof the water be accelerated by the farmer? First and foremost, by\r\nplowing at the right time and to the right depth. Plowing should be\r\ndone deeply and thoroughly so that the falling water may immediately\r\nbe drawn down to the full depth of the loose, spongy, plowed soil,\r\naway from the action of the sunshine or winds. The moisture thus\r\ncaught will slowly work its way down into the lower layers of the\r\nsoil. Deep plowing is always to be recommended for successful\r\ndry-farming.\r\n\r\nIn humid districts where there is a great difference between the\r\nsoil and the subsoil, it is often dangerous to turn up the lifeless\r\nsubsoil, but in arid districts where there is no real\r\ndifferentiation between the soil and the subsoil, deep plowing may\r\nsafely be recommended. True, occasionally, soils are found in the\r\ndry-farm territory which are underlaid near the surface by an inert\r\nclay or infertile layer of lime or gypsum which forbids the farmer\r\nputting the plow too deeply into the soil. Such soils, however' are\r\nseldom worth while trying for dry-farm purposes. Deep plowing must\r\nbe practiced for the best dry-farming results.\r\n\r\nIt naturally follows that subsoiling should be a beneficial practice\r\non dry-farms. Whether or not the great cost of subsoiling is offset\r\nby the resulting increased yields is an open question; it is, in\r\nfact, quite doubtful. Deep plowing done at the right time and\r\nfrequently enough is possibly sufficient. By deep plowing is meant\r\nstirring or turning the soil to a depth of six to ten inches below\r\nthe surface of the land.\r\n\r\nFall plowing far water storage\r\n\r\nIt is not alone sufficient to plow and to plow deeply; it is also\r\nnecessary that the plowing be done at the right time. In the very\r\ngreat majority of cases over the whole dry-farm territory, plowing\r\nshould be done in the fall. There are three reasons for this: First,\r\nafter the crop is harvested, the soil should be stirred immediately,\r\nso that it can be exposed to the full action of the weathering\r\nagencies, whether the winters be open or closed. If for any reason\r\nplowing cannot be done early it is often advantageous to follow the\r\nharvester with a disk and to plow later when convenient. The\r\nchemical effect on the soil resulting from the weathering, made\r\npossible by fall plowing, as will be shown in Chapter IX, is of\r\nitself so great as to warrant the teaching of the general practice\r\nof fall plowing. Secondly, the early stirring of the soil prevents\r\nevaporation of the moisture in the soil during late summer and the\r\nfall. Thirdly, in the parts of the dry-farm territory where much\r\nprecipitation occurs in the fall, winter, or early spring, fall\r\nplowing permits much of this precipitation to enter the soil and be\r\nstored there until needed by plants.\r\n\r\nA number of experiment stations have compared plowing done in the\r\nearly fall with plowing done late in the fall or in the spring, and\r\nwith almost no exception it has been found that early fall plowing\r\nis water-conserving and in other ways advantageous. It was observed\r\non a Utah dry-farm that the fall-plowed land contained, to a depth\r\nof 10 feet, 7.47 acre-inches more water than the adjoining\r\nspring-plowed land--a saving of nearly one half of a year's\r\nprecipitation. The ground should be plowed in the early fall as soon\r\nas possible after the crop is harvested. It should then be left in\r\nthe rough throughout the winter, so that it may be mellowed and\r\nbroken down by the elements. The rough lend further has a tendency\r\nto catch and hold the snow that may be blown by the wind, thus\r\ninsuring a more even distribution of the water from the melting\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nA common objection to fall plowing is that the ground is so dry in\r\nthe fall that it does not plow up well, and that the great dry clods\r\nof earth do much to injure the physical condition of the soil. It is\r\nvery doubtful if such an objection is generally valid, especially if\r\nthe soil is so cropped as to leave a fair margin of moisture in the\r\nsoil at harvest time. The atmospheric agencies will usually break\r\ndown the clods, and the physical result of the treatment will be\r\nbeneficial. Undoubtedly, the fall plowing of dry land is somewhat\r\ndifficult, but the good results more than pay the farmer for his\r\ntrouble. Late fall plowing, after the fall rains have softened the\r\nland, is preferable to spring plowing. If for any reason the farmer\r\nfeels that he must practice spring plowing, he should do it as early\r\nas possible in the spring. Of course, it is inadvisable to plow the\r\nsoil when it is so wet as to injure its tilth seriously, but as soon\r\nas that danger period has passed, the plow should be placed in the\r\nground. The moisture in the soil will thereby be conserved, and\r\nwhatever water may fall during the spring months will be conserved\r\nalso. This is of especial importance in the Great Plains region and\r\nin any district where the precipitation comes in the spring and\r\nwinter months.\r\n\r\nLikewise, after fall plowing, the land must be well stirred in the\r\nearly spring with the disk harrow or a similar implement, to enable\r\nthe spring rains to enter the soil easily and to prevent the\r\nevaporation of the water already stored. Where the rainfall is quite\r\nabundant and the plowed land has been beaten down by the frequent\r\nrains, the land should be plowed again in the spring. Where such\r\nconditions do not exist, the treatment of the soil with the disk and\r\nharrow in the spring is usually sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn recent dry-farm experience it has been fairly completely\r\ndemonstrated that, providing the soil is well stored with water,\r\ncrops will mature even if no rain falls during the growing season.\r\nNaturally, under most circumstances, any rains that may fall on a\r\nwell-prepared soil during the season of crop growth will tend to\r\nincrease the crop yield, but some profitable yield is assured, in\r\nspite of the season, if the soil is well stored with water at seed\r\ntime. This is an important principle in the system of dry-farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nREGULATING THE EVAPORATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demonstration in the last chapter that the water which falls as\r\nrain or snow may be stored in the soil for the use of plants is of\r\nfirst importance in dry-farming, for it makes the farmer\r\nindependent, in a large measure, of the distribution of the\r\nrainfall. The dry-farmer who goes into the summer with a soil well\r\nstored with water cares little whether summer rains come or not, for\r\nhe knows that his crops will mature in spite of external drouth. In\r\nfact, as will be shown later, in many dry-farm sections where the\r\nsummer rains are light they are a positive detriment to the farmer\r\nwho by careful farming has stored his deep soil with an abundance of\r\nwater. Storing the soil with water is, however, only the first step\r\nin making the rains of fall, winter, or the preceding year available\r\nfor plant growth. As soon as warm growing weather comes,\r\nwater-dissipating forces come into play, and water is lost by\r\nevaporation. The farmer must, therefore, use all precautions to keep\r\nthe moisture in the soil until such time as the roots of the crop\r\nmay draw it into the plants to be used in plant production. That is,\r\nas far as possible, direct evaporation of water from the soil must\r\nbe prevented.\r\n\r\nFew farmers really realize the immense possible annual evaporation\r\nin the dry-farm territory. It is always much larger than the total\r\nannual rainfall. In fact, an arid region may be defined as one in\r\nwhich under natural conditions several times more water evaporates\r\nannually from a free water surface than falls as rain and snow. For\r\nthat reason many students of aridity pay little attention to\r\ntemperature, relative humidity, or winds, and simply measure the\r\nevaporation from a free water surface in the locality in question.\r\nIn order to obtain a measure of the aridity, MacDougal has\r\nconstructed the following table, showing the annual precipitation\r\nand the annual evaporation at several well-known localities in the\r\ndry-farm territory.\r\n\r\nTrue, the localities included in the following table are extreme,\r\nbut they illustrate the large possible evaporation, ranging from\r\nabout six to thirty-five times the precipitation. At the same time\r\nit must be borne in mind that while such rates of evaporation may\r\noccur from free water surfaces, the evaporation from agricultural\r\nsoils under like conditions is very much smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace            Annual Precipitation  Annual Evaporation  Ratio\r\n                 (In Inches)           (In Inches)\r\nEl Paso, Texas   9.23                  80                  8.7\r\nFort Wingate,\r\nNew Mexico       14.00                 80                  5.7\r\nFort Yuma,\r\nArizona          2.84                  100                 35.2\r\nTucson, AZ       11.74                 90                  7.7\r\nMohave, CA       4.97                  95                  19.1\r\nHawthorne,\r\nNevada           4.50                  80                  17.5\r\nWinnemucca,\r\nNevada           9.51                  80                  9.6\r\nSt. George, Utah 6.46                  90                  13.9\r\nFort Duchesne,\r\nUtah             6.49                  75                  11.6\r\nPineville,\r\nOregon           9.01                  70                  7.8\r\nLost River,\r\nIdaho            8.47                  70                  8.3\r\nLaramie,\r\nWyoming          9.81                  70                  7.1\r\nTorres, Mexico   16.97                 100                 6.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the methods employed for checking evaporation from the\r\nsoil, it is necessary to review briefly the conditions that\r\ndetermine the evaporation of water into the air, and the manner in\r\nwhich water moves in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe formation of water vapor\r\n\r\nWhenever water is left freely exposed to the air, it evaporates;\r\nthat is, it passes into the gaseous state and mixes with the gases\r\nof the air. Even snow and ice give off water vapor, though in very\r\nsmall quantities. The quantity of water vapor which can enter a\r\ngiven volume of air is definitely limited. For instance, at the\r\ntemperature of freezing water 2.126 grains of water vapor can enter\r\none cubic foot of air, but no more. When air contains all the water\r\npossible, it is said to be saturated, and evaporation then ceases.\r\nThe practical effect of this is the well-known experience that on\r\nthe seashore, where the air is often very nearly fully saturated\r\nwith water vapor, the drying of clothes goes on very slowly, whereas\r\nin the interior, like the dry-farming territory, away from the\r\nocean, where the air is far from being saturated, drying goes on\r\nvery rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water necessary to saturate air varies greatly with\r\nthe temperature. It is to be noted that as the temperature\r\nincreases, the amount of water that may be held by the air also\r\nincreases; and proportionately more rapidly than the increase in\r\ntemperature. This is generally well understood in common experience,\r\nas in drying clothes rapidly by hanging them before a hot fire. At a\r\ntemperature of 100 deg F., which is often reached in portions of the\r\ndry-farm territory during the growing season, a given volume of air\r\ncan hold more than nine times as much water vapor as at the\r\ntemperature of freezing water. This is an exceedingly important\r\nprinciple in dry-farm practices, for it explains the relatively easy\r\npossibility of storing water during the fall and winter when the\r\ntemperature is low and the moisture usually abundant, and the\r\ngreater difficulty of storing the rain that falls largely, as in the\r\nGreat Plains area, in the summer when water-dissipating forces are\r\nvery active. This law also emphasizes the truth that it is in times\r\nof warm weather that every precaution must be taken to prevent the\r\nevaporation of water from the soil surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperature     Grains of Water held in\r\nin Degrees F.   One Cubic Foot of Air\r\n32              2.126\r\n40              2.862\r\n50              4.089\r\n60              5.756\r\n70              7.992\r\n80              10.949\r\n90              14.810\r\n100             19.790\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of course well understood that the atmosphere as a whole is\r\nnever saturated with water vapor. Such saturation is at the best\r\nonly local, as, for instance, on the seashore during quiet days,\r\nwhen the layer of air over the water may be fully saturated, or in a\r\nfield containing much water from which, on quiet warm days, enough\r\nwater may evaporate to saturate the layer of air immediately upon\r\nthe soil and around the plants. Whenever, in such cases, the air\r\nbegins to move and the wind blows, the saturated air is mixed with\r\nthe larger portion of unsaturated air, and evaporation is again\r\nincreased. Meanwhile, it must be borne in mind that into a layer of\r\nsaturated air resting upon a field of growing plants very little\r\nwater evaporates, and that the chief water-dissipating power of\r\nwinds lies in the removal of this saturated layer. Winds or air\r\nmovements of any kind, therefore, become enemies of the farmer who\r\ndepends upon a limited rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water actually found in a given volume of air at a\r\ncertain temperature, compared with the largest amount it can hold,\r\nis called the relative humidity of the air. As shown in Chapter IV,\r\nthe relative humidity becomes smaller as the rainfall decreases. The\r\nlower the relative humidity is at a given temperature, the more\r\nrapidly will water evaporate into the air. There is no more striking\r\nconfirmation of this law than the fact that at a temperature of 90\r\ndeg sunstrokes and similar ailments are reported in great number\r\nfrom New York, while the people of Salt Lake City are perfectly\r\ncomfortable. In New York the relative humidity in summer is about 73\r\nper cent; in Salt Lake City, about 35 per cent. At a high summer\r\ntemperature evaporation from the skin goes on slowly in New York and\r\nrapidly in Salt Lake City, with the resulting discomfort or comfort.\r\nSimilarly, evaporation from soils goes on rapidly under a low and\r\nslowly under a high percentage of relative humidity.\r\n\r\nEvaporation from water surfaces is hastened, therefore, by (1) an\r\nincrease in the temperature, (2) an increase in the air movements or\r\nwinds, and (3) a decrease in the relative humidity. The temperature\r\nis higher; the relative humidity lower, and the winds usually more\r\nabundant in arid than in humid regions. The dry-farmer must\r\nconsequently use all possible precautions to prevent evaporation\r\nfrom the soil.\r\n\r\nConditions of evaporation from from soils\r\n\r\nEvaporation does not alone occur from a surface of free water. All\r\nwet or moist substances lose by evaporation most of the water that\r\nthey hold, providing the conditions of temperature and relative\r\nhumidity are favorable. Thus, from a wet soil, evaporation is\r\ncontinually removing water. Yet, under ordinary conditions, it is\r\nimpossible to remove all the water, for a small quantity is\r\nattracted so strongly by the soil particles that only a temperature\r\nabove the boiling point of water will drive it out. This part of the\r\nsoil is the hygroscopic moisture spoken of in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be kept in mind that evaporation does not occur as\r\nrapidly from wet soil as from a water surface, unless all the soil\r\npores are so completely filled with water that the soil surface is\r\npractically a water surface. The reason for this reduced evaporation\r\nfrom a wet soil is almost self-evident. There is a comparatively\r\nstrong attraction between soil and water, which enables the moisture\r\nto cling as a thin capillary film around the soil particles, against\r\nthe force of gravity. Ordinarily, only capillary water is found in\r\nwell-tilled soil, and the force causing evaporation must be strong\r\nenough to overcome this attraction besides changing the water into\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nThe less water there is in a soil, the thinner the water film, and\r\nthe more firmly is the water held. Hence, the rate of evaporation\r\ndecreases with the decrease in soil-moisture. This law is confirmed\r\nby actual field tests. For instance, as an average of 274 trials\r\nmade at the Utah Station, it was found that three soils, otherwise\r\nalike, that contained, respectively, 22.63 per cent, 17.14 per cent,\r\nand 12.75 per cent of water lost in two weeks, to a depth of eight\r\nfeet, respectively 21.0, 17. 1, and 10.0 pounds of water per square\r\nfoot. Similar experiments conducted elsewhere also furnish proof of\r\nthe correctness of this principle. From this point of view the\r\ndry-farmer does not want his soils to be unnecessarily moist. The\r\ndry-farmer can reduce the per cent of water in the soil without\r\ndiminishing the total amount of water by so treating the soil that\r\nthe water will distribute itself to considerable depths. This brings\r\ninto prominence again the practices of fall plowing, deep plowing,\r\nsubsoiling, and the choice of deep soils for dry-farming.\r\n\r\nVery much for the same reasons, evaporation goes on more slowly from\r\nwater in which salt or other substances have been dissolved. The\r\nattraction between the water and the dissolved salt seems to be\r\nstrong enough to resist partially the force causing evaporation.\r\nSoil-water always contains some of the soil ingredients in solution,\r\nand consequently under the given conditions evaporation occurs more\r\nslowly from soil-water than from pure water. Now, the more fertile a\r\nsoil is, that is, the more soluble plant-food it contains, the more\r\nmaterial will be dissolved in the soil-water, and as a result the\r\nmore slowly will evaporation take place. Fallowing, cultivation,\r\nthorough plowing and manuring, which increase the store of soluble\r\nplant-food, all tend to diminish evaporation. While these conditions\r\nmay have little value in the eyes of the farmer who is under an\r\nabundant rainfall, they are of great importance to the dry-farmer.\r\nIt is only by utilizing every possibility of conserving water and\r\nfertility that dry-farming may be made a perfectly safe practice.\r\n\r\nLoss by evaporation chiefly at the surface\r\n\r\nEvaporation goes on from every wet substance. Water evaporates\r\ntherefore from the wet soil grains under the surface as well as from\r\nthose at the surface. In developing a system of practice which will\r\nreduce evaporation to a minimum it must be learned whether the water\r\nwhich evaporates from the soil particles far below the surface is\r\ncarried in large quantities into the atmosphere and thus lost to\r\nplant use. Over forty years ago, Nessler subjected this question to\r\nexperiment and found that the loss by evaporation occurs almost\r\nwholly at the soil surface, and that very little if any is lost\r\ndirectly by evaporation from the lower soil layers. Other\r\nexperimenters have confirmed this conclusion, and very recently\r\nBuckingham, examining the same subject, found that while there is a\r\nvery slow upward movement of the soil gases into the atmosphere, the\r\ntotal quantity of the water thus lost by direct evaporation from\r\nsoil, a foot below the surface, amounted at most to one inch of\r\nrainfall in six years. This is insignificant even under semiarid and\r\narid conditions. However, the rate of loss of water by direct\r\nevaporation from the lower soil layers increases with the porosity\r\nof the soil, that is, with the space not filled with soil particles\r\nor water. Fine-grained soils, therefore, lose the least water in\r\nthis manner. Nevertheless, if coarse-grained soils are well filled\r\nwith water, by deep fall plowing and by proper summer fallowing for\r\nthe conservation of moisture, the loss of moisture by direct\r\nevaporation from the lower soil layers need not be larger than from\r\nfiner grained soils\r\n\r\nThus again are emphasized the principles previously laid down that,\r\nfor the most successful dry-farming, the soil should always be kept\r\nwell filled with moisture, even if it means that the land, after\r\nbeing broken, must lie fallow for one or two seasons, until a\r\nsufficient amount of moisture has accumulated. Further, the\r\ncorrelative principle is emphasized that the moisture in dry-farm\r\nlands should be stored deeply, away from the immediate action of the\r\nsun's rays upon the land surface. The necessity for deep soils is\r\nthus again brought out.\r\n\r\nThe great loss of soil moisture due to an accumulation of water in\r\nthe upper twelve inches is well brought out in the experiments\r\nconducted by the Utah Station. The following is selected from the\r\nnumerous data on the subject. Two soils, almost identical in\r\ncharacter, contained respectively 17.57 per cent and 16.55 per cent\r\nof water on an average to a depth of eight feet; that is, the total\r\namount of water held by the two soils was practically identical.\r\nOwing to varying cultural treatment, the distribution of the water\r\nin the soil was not uniform; one contained 23.22 per cent and the\r\nother 16.64 per cent of water in the first twelve inches. During the\r\nfirst seven days the soil that contained the highest percentage of\r\nwater in the first foot lost 13.30 pounds of water, while the other\r\nlost only 8.48 pounds per square foot. This great difference was due\r\nno doubt to the fact that direct evaporation takes place in\r\nconsiderable quantity only in the upper twelve inches of soil, where\r\nthe sun's heat has a full chance to act.\r\n\r\nAny practice which enables the rains to sink quickly to considerable\r\ndepths should be adopted by the dry-farmer. This is perhaps one of\r\nthe great reasons for advocating the expensive but usually effective\r\nsubsoil plowing on dry-farms. It is a very common experience, in the\r\narid region, that great, deep cracks form during hot weather. From\r\nthe walls of these cracks evaporation goes on, as from the topsoil,\r\nand the passing winds renew the air so that the evaporation may go\r\non rapidly. The dry-farmer must go over the land as often as needs\r\nbe with some implement that will destroy and fill up the cracks that\r\nmay have been formed. In a field of growing crops this is often\r\ndifficult to do; but it is not impossible that hand hoeing,\r\nexpensive as it is, would pay well in the saving of soil moisture\r\nand the consequent increase in crop yield.\r\n\r\nHow soil water reaches the surface\r\n\r\nIt may be accepted as an established truth that the direct\r\nevaporation of water from wet soils occurs almost wholly at the\r\nsurface. Yet it is well known that evaporation from the soil surface\r\nmay continue until the soil-moisture to a depth of eight or ten feet\r\nor more is depleted. This is shown by the following analyses of\r\ndry-farm soil in early spring and midsummer. No attempt was made to\r\nconserve the moisture in the soil:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPer cent of water in Early spring  Midsummer\r\n1st foot             20.84         8.83\r\n2nd foot             20.06         8.87\r\n3rd foot             19.62         11.03\r\n4th foot             18.28         9.59\r\n5th foot             18.70         11.27\r\n6th foot             14.29         11.03\r\n7th foot             14.48         8.95\r\n8th foot             13.83         9.47\r\nAvg                  17.51         9.88\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case water had undoubtedly passed by capillary movement from\r\nthe depth of eight feet to a point near the surface where direct\r\nevaporation could occur. As explained in the last chapter, water\r\nwhich is held as a film around the soil particles is called\r\ncapillary water; and it is in the capillary form that water may be\r\nstored in dry-farm soils. Moreover, it is the capillary\r\nsoil-moisture alone which is of real value in crop production. This\r\ncapillary water tends to distribute itself uniformly throughout the\r\nsoil, in accordance with the prevailing conditions and forces. If no\r\nwater is removed from the soil, in course of time the distribution\r\nof the soil-water will be such that the thickness of the film at any\r\npoint in the soil mass is a direct resultant of the various forces\r\nacting at that particular point. There will then be no appreciable\r\nmovement of the soil-moisture. Such a condition is approximated in\r\nlate winter or early spring before planting begins. During the\r\ngreater part of the year, however, no such quiescent state can\r\noccur, for there are numerous disturbing elements that normally are\r\nactive, among which the three most effective are (l) the addition of\r\nwater to the soil by rains; (2) the evaporation of water from the\r\ntopsoil, due to the more active meteorological factors during\r\nspring, summer, and fall; and (3) the abstraction of water from the\r\nsoil by plant roots.\r\n\r\nWater, entering the soil, moves downward under the influence of\r\ngravity as gravitational water, until under the attractive influence\r\nof the soil it has been converted into capillary water and adheres\r\nto the soil particles as a film. If the soil were dry, and the film\r\ntherefore thin, the rain water would move downward only a short\r\ndistance as gravitational water; if the soil were wet, and the film\r\ntherefore thick, the water would move down to a greater distance\r\nbefore being exhausted. If, as is often the case in humid districts,\r\nthe soil is saturated, that is, the film is as thick as the\r\nparticles can hold, the water would pass right through the soil and\r\nconnect with the standing water below. This, of course, is seldom\r\nthe case in dry-farm districts. In any soil, excepting one already\r\nsaturated, the addition of water will produce a thickening of the\r\nsoil-water film to the full descent of the water. This immediately\r\ndestroys the conditions of equilibrium formerly existing, for the\r\nmoisture is not now uniformly distributed. Consequently a process of\r\nredistribution begins which continues until the nearest approach to\r\nequilibrium is restored. In this process water will pass in every\r\ndirection from the wet portion of the soil to the drier; it does not\r\nnecessarily mean that water will actually pass from the wet portion\r\nto the drier portion; usually, at the driest point a little water is\r\ndrawn from the adjoining point, which in turn draws from the next,\r\nand that from the next, until the redistribution is complete. The\r\nprocess is very much like stuffing wool into a sack which already is\r\nloosely filled. The new wool does not reach the bottom of the sack,\r\nyet there is more wool in the bottom than there was before.\r\n\r\nIf a plant-root is actively feeding some distance under the soil\r\nsurface, the reverse process occurs. At the feeding point the root\r\ncontinually abstracts water from the soil grains and thus makes the\r\nfilm thinner in that locality. This causes a movement of moisture\r\nsimilar to the one above described, from the wetter portions of the\r\nsoil to the portion being dried out by the action of the plant-root.\r\nSoil many feet or even rods distant may assist in supplying such an\r\nactive root with moisture. When the thousands of tiny roots sent out\r\nby each plant are recalled. it may well be understood what a\r\nconfusion of pulls and counter-pulls upon the soil-moisture exists\r\nin any cultivated soil. In fact, the soil-water film may be viewed\r\nas being in a state of trembling activity, tending to place itself\r\nin full equilibrium with the surrounding contending forces which,\r\nthemselves, constantly change. Were it not that the water film held\r\nclosely around the soil particles is possessed of extreme mobility,\r\nit would not be possible to meet the demands of the plants upon the\r\nwater at comparatively great distances. Even as it is, it frequently\r\nhappens that when crops are planted too thickly on dry-farms, the\r\nsoil-moisture cannot move quickly enough to the absorbing roots to\r\nmaintain plant growth, and crop failure results. Incidentally, this\r\npoints to planting that shall be proportional to the moisture\r\ncontained by the soil. See Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nAs the temperature rises in spring, with a decrease in the relative\r\nhumidity, and an increase in direct sunshine, evaporation from the\r\nsoil surface increases greatly. However, as the topsoil becomes\r\ndrier, that is, as the water fihn becomes thinner, there is an\r\nattempt at readjustment, and water moves upward to take the place of\r\nthat lost by evaporation. As this continues throughout the season,\r\nthe moisture stored eight or ten feet or more below the surface is\r\ngradually brought to the top and evaporated, and thus lost to plant\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe effect of rapid top drying of soils\r\n\r\nAs the water held by soils diminishes, and the water film around the\r\nsoil grains becomes thinner, the capillary movement of the\r\nsoil-water is retarded. This is easily understood by recalling that\r\nthe soil particles have an attraction for water, which is of\r\ndefinite value, and may be measured by the thickest film that may be\r\nheld against gravity. When the film is thinned, it does not diminish\r\nthe attraction of the soil for water; it simply results in a\r\nstronger pull upon the water and a firmer holding of the film\r\nagainst the surfaces of the soil grains. To move soil-water under\r\nsuch conditions requires the expenditure of more energy than is\r\nnecessary for moving water in a saturated or nearly saturated soil.\r\nUnder like conditions, therefore, the thinner the soil-water film\r\nthe more difficult will be the upward movement of the soil-water and\r\nthe slower the evaporation from the topsoil.\r\n\r\nAs drying goes on, a point is reached at which the capillary\r\nmovement of the water wholly ceases. This is probably when little\r\nmore than the hygroscopic moisture remains. In fact, very dry soil\r\nand water repel each other. This is shown in the common experience\r\nof driving along a road in summer, immediately after a light shower.\r\nThe masses of dust are wetted only on the outside, and as the wheels\r\npass through them the dry dust is revealed. It is an important fact\r\nthat very dry soil furnishes a very effective protection against the\r\ncapillary movement of water.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the principle above established if the surface\r\nsoil could be dried to the point where capillarity is very slow, the\r\nevaporation would be diminished or almost wholly stopped. More than\r\na quarter of a century ago, Eser showed experimentally that\r\nsoil-water may be saved by drying the surface soil rapidly. Under\r\ndry-farm conditions it frequently occurs that the draft upon the\r\nwater of the soil is so great that nearly all the water is quickly\r\nand so completely abstracted from the upper few inches of soil that\r\nthey are left as an effective protection against further\r\nevaporation. For instance, in localities where hot dry winds are of\r\ncommon occurrence, the upper layer of soil is sometimes completely\r\ndried before the water in the lower layers can by slow capillary\r\nmovement reach the top. The dry soil layer then prevents further\r\nloss of water, and the wind because of its intensity has helped to\r\nconserve the soil-moisture. Similarly in localities where the\r\nrelative humidity is low, the sunshine abundant, and the temperature\r\nhigh, evaporation may go on so rapidly that the lower soil layers\r\ncannot supply the demands made, and the topsoil then dries out so\r\ncompletely as to form a protective covering against further\r\nevaporation. It is on this principle that the native desert soils of\r\nthe United States, untouched by the plow, and the surfaces of which\r\nare sun-baked, are often found to possess large percentages of water\r\nat lower depths. Whitney recorded this observation with considerable\r\nsurprise, many years ago, and other observers have found the same\r\nconditions at nearly all points of the arid region. This matter has\r\nbeen subjected to further study by Buckingham, who placed a variety\r\nof soils under artificially arid and humid conditions. It was found\r\nin every case that, the initial evaporation was greater under arid\r\nconditions, but as the process went on and the topsoil of the arid\r\nsoil became dry, more water was lost under humid conditions. For the\r\nwhole experimental period, also, more water was lost under humid\r\nconditions. It was notable that the dry protective layer was formed\r\nmore slowly on alkali soils, which would point to the inadvisability\r\nof using alkali lands for dry-farm purposes. All in all, however, it\r\nappears \"that under very arid conditions a soil automatically\r\nprotects itself from drying by the formation of a natural mulch on\r\nthe surface.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, dry-farm soils differ greatly in their power of forming\r\nsuch a mulch. A heavy clay or a light sandy soil appears to have\r\nless power of such automatic protection than a loamy soil. An\r\nadmixture of limestone seems to favor the formation of such a\r\nnatural protective mulch. Ordinarily, the farmer can further the\r\nformation of a dry topsoil layer by stirring the soil thoroughly.\r\nThis assists the sunshine and the air to evaporate the water very\r\nquickly. Such cultivation is very desirable for other reasons also,\r\nas will soon be discussed. Meanwhile, the water-dissipating forces\r\nof the dry-farm section are not wholly objectionable, for whether\r\nthe land be cultivated or not, they tend to hasten the formation of\r\ndry surface layers of soil which guard against excessive\r\nevaporation. It is in moist cloudy weather, when the drying process\r\nis slow, that evaporation causes the greatest losses of\r\nsoil-moisture.\r\n\r\nThe effect of shading\r\n\r\nDirect sunshine is, next to temperature, the most active cause of\r\nrapid evaporation from moist soil surfaces. Whenever, therefore,\r\nevaporation is not rapid enough to form a dry protective layer of\r\ntopsoil, shading helps materially in reducing surface losses of\r\nsoil-water. Under very arid conditions, however, it is questionable\r\nwhether in all cases shading has a really beneficial effect, though\r\nunder semiarid or sub-humid conditions the benefits derived from\r\nshading are increased largely. Ebermayer showed in 1873 that the\r\nshading due to the forest cover reduced evaporation 62 per cent, and\r\nmany experiments since that day have confirmed this conclusion. At\r\nthe Utah Station, under arid conditions, it was found that shading a\r\npot of soil, which otherwise was subjected to water-dissipating\r\ninfluences, saved 29 per cent of the loss due to evaporation from a\r\npot which was not shaded. This principle cannot be applied very\r\ngreatly in practice, but it points to a somewhat thick planting,\r\nproportioned to the water held by the soil. It also shows a possible\r\nbenefit to be derived from the high header straw which is allowed to\r\nstand for several weeks in dry-farm sections where the harvest comes\r\nearly and the fall plowing is done late, as in the mountain states.\r\nThe high header stubble shades the ground very thoroughly. Thus the\r\nstubble may be made to conserve the soil-moisture in dry-farm\r\nsections, where grain is harvested by the \"header\" method.\r\n\r\nA special case of shading is the mulching of land with straw or\r\nother barnyard litter, or with leaves, as in the forest. Such\r\nmulching reduces evaporation, but only in part, because of its\r\nshading action, since it acts also as a loose top layer of soil\r\nmatter breaking communication with the lower soil layers.\r\n\r\nWhenever the soil is carefully stirred, as will be described, the\r\nvalue of shading as a means or checking evaporation disappears\r\nalmost entirely. It is only with soils which are tolerably moist at\r\nthe surface that shading acts beneficially.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa in cultivated rows. This practice is employed to make\r\npossible the growth of alfalfa and other perennial crops on arid\r\nlands without irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe effect of tillage\r\n\r\nCapillary soil-moisture moves from particle to particle until the\r\nsurface is reached. The closer the soil grains are packed together,\r\nthe greater the number of points or contact, and the more easily\r\nwill the movement of the soil-moisture proceed. If by any means a\r\nlayer of the soil is so loosened as to reduce the number of points\r\nof contact, the movement of the soil-moisture is correspondingly\r\nhindered. The process is somewhat similar to the experience in large\r\nr airway stations. Just before train time a great crowd of people is\r\ngathered outside or the gates ready to show their tickets. If one\r\ngate is opened, a certain number of passengers can pass through each\r\nminute; if two are opened, nearly twice as many may be admitted in\r\nthe same time; if more gates are opened, the passengers will be able\r\nto enter the train more rapidly. The water in the lower layers of\r\nthe soil is ready to move upward whenever a call is made upon it. To\r\nreach the surface it must pass from soil grain to soil grain, and\r\nthe larger the number of grains that touch, the more quickly and\r\neasily will the water reach the surface, for the points of contact\r\nof the soil particles may be likened to the gates of the railway\r\nstation. Now if, by a thorough stirring and loosening of the\r\ntopsoil, the number of points of contact between the top and subsoil\r\nis greatly reduced, the upward flow of water is thereby largely\r\nchecked. Such a loosening of the topsoil for the purpose of reducing\r\nevaporation from the topsoil has come to be called cultivation, and\r\nincludes plowing, harrowing, disking, hoeing, and other cultural\r\noperations by which the topsoil is stirred. The breaking of the\r\npoints of contact between the top and subsoil is undoubtedly the\r\nmain reason for the efficiency of cultivation, but it is also to be\r\nremembered that such stirring helps to dry the top soil very\r\nthoroughly, and as has been explained a layer of dry soil of itself\r\nis a very effective check upon surface evaporation.\r\n\r\nThat the stirring or cultivation of the topsoil really does diminish\r\nevaporation of water from the soil has been shown by numerous\r\ninvestigations. In 1868, Nessler found that during six weeks of an\r\nordinary German summer a stirred soil lost 510 grams of water per\r\nsquare foot, while the adjoining compacted soil lost 1680 grams,--a\r\nsaving due to cultivation of nearly 60 per cent. Wagner, testing the\r\ncorrectness of Nessler's work, found, in 1874, that cultivation\r\nreduced the evaporation a little more than 60 per cent; Johnson, in\r\n1878, confirmed the truth of the principle on American soils, and\r\nLevi Stockbridge, working about the same time, also on American\r\nsoils, found that cultivation diminished evaporation on a clay soil\r\nabout 23 per cent, on a sandy loam 55 per cent, and on a heavy loam\r\nnearly 13 per cent. All the early work done on this subject was done\r\nunder humid conditions, and it is only in recent years that\r\nconfirmation of this important principle has been obtained for the\r\nsoils of the dry-farm region. Fortier, working under California\r\nconditions, determined that cultivation reduced the evaporation from\r\nthe soil surface over 55 per cent. At the Utah Station similar\r\nexperiments have shown that the saving of soil-moisture by\r\ncultivation was 63 per cent for a clay soil, 34 per cent for a\r\ncoarse sand, and 13 per cent for a clay loam. Further, practical\r\nexperience has demonstrated time and time again that in cultivation\r\nthe dry-farmer has a powerful means of preventing evaporation from\r\nagricultural soils.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with cultivation is the practice of scattering\r\nstraw or other litter over the ground. Such artificial mulches are\r\nvery effective in reducing evaporation. Ebermayer found that by\r\nspreading straw on the land, the evaporation was reduced 22 per\r\ncent; Wagner found under similar conditions a saving of 38 per cent,\r\nand these results have been confirmed by many other investigators.\r\nOn the modern dry-farms, which are large in area, the artificial\r\nmulching of soils cannot become a very extensive practice, yet it is\r\nwell to bear the principle in mind. The practice of harvesting\r\ndry-farm grain with the header and plowing under the high stubble in\r\nthe fall is a phase of cultivation for water conservation that\r\ndeserves special notice. The straw, thus incorporated into the soil,\r\ndecomposes quite readily in spite of the popular notion to the\r\ncontrary, and makes the soil more porous, and, therefore, more\r\neffectively worked for the prevention of evaporation. When this\r\npractice is continued for considerable periods, the topsoil becomes\r\nrich in organic matter, which assists in retarding evaporation,\r\nbesides increasing the fertility of the land. When straw cannot be\r\nfed to advantage, as is yet the case on many of the western\r\ndry-farms, it would be better to scatter it over the land than to\r\nburn it, as is often done. Anything that covers the ground or\r\nloosens the topsoil prevents in a measure the evaporation of the\r\nwater stored in lower soil depths for the use of crops.\r\n\r\nDepth of cultivation\r\n\r\nThe all-important practice for the dry-farmer who is entering upon\r\nthe growing season is cultivation. The soil must be covered\r\ncontinually with a deep layer of dry loose soil, which because of\r\nits looseness and dryness makes evaporation difficult. A leading\r\nquestion in connection with cultivation is the depth to which the\r\nsoil should be stirred for the best results. Many of the early\r\nstudents of the subject found that a soil mulch only one half inch\r\nin depth was effective in retaining a large part of the\r\nsoil-moisture which noncultivated soils would lose by evaporation.\r\nSoils differ greatly in the rate of evaporation from their surfaces.\r\nSome form a natural mulch when dried, which prevents further water\r\nloss. Others form only a thin hard crust, below which lies an active\r\nevaporating surface of wet soil. Soils which dry out readily and\r\ncrumble on top into a natural mulch should be cultivated deeply, for\r\na shallow cultivation does not extend beyond the naturally formed\r\nmulch. In fact, on certain calcareous soils, the surfaces of which\r\ndry out quickly and form a good protection against evaporation,\r\nshallow cultivations often cause a greater evaporation by disturbing\r\nthe almost perfect natural mulch. Clay or sand soils, which do not\r\nso well form a natural mulch, will respond much better to shallow\r\ncultivations. In general, however, the deeper the cultivation, the\r\nmore effective it is in reducing evaporation. Fortier, in the\r\nexperiments in California to which allusion has already been made,\r\nshowed the greater value of deep cultivation. During a period of\r\nfifteen days, beginning immediately after an irrigation, the soil\r\nwhich had not been mulched lost by evaporation nearly one fourth of\r\nthe total amount of water that had been added. A mulch 4 inches deep\r\nsaved about 72 per cent of the evaporation; a mulch 8 inches deep\r\nsaved about 88 per cent, and a mulch 10 inches deep stopped\r\nevaporation almost wholly. It is a most serious mistake for the\r\ndry-farmer, who attempts cultivation for soil-moisture conservation,\r\nto fail to get the best results simply to save a few cents per acre\r\nin added labor.\r\n\r\nWhen to cultivate or till\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the rate of evaporation is greater\r\nfrom a wet than from a dry surface. It follows, therefore, that the\r\ncritical time for preventing evaporation is when the soil is\r\nwettest. After the soil is tolerably dry, a very large portion of\r\nthe soil-moisture has been lost, which possibly might have been\r\nsaved by earlier cultivation. The truth of this statement is well\r\nshown by experiments conducted by the Utah Station. In one case on a\r\nsoil well filled with water, during a three weeks' period, nearly\r\none half of the total loss occurred the first, while only one fifth\r\nfell on the third week. Of the amount lost during the first week,\r\nover 60 per cent occurred during the first three days. Cultivation\r\nshould, therefore, be practiced as soon as possible after conditions\r\nfavorable for evaporation have been established. This means, first,\r\nthat in early spring, just as soon as the land is dry enough to be\r\nworked without causing puddling, the soil should be deeply and\r\nthoroughly stirred. Spring plowing, done as early as possible, is an\r\nexcellent practice for forming a mulch against evaporation. Even\r\nwhen the land has been fall-plowed, spring plowing is very\r\nbeneficial, though on fall-plowed land the disk harrow is usually\r\nused in early spring, and if it is set at rather a sharp angle, and\r\nproperly weighted, so that it cuts deeply into the ground, it is\r\npractically as effective as spring plowing. The chief danger to the\r\ndry-farmer is that he will permit the early spring days to slip by\r\nuntil, when at last he begins spring cultivation, a large portion of\r\nthe stored soil-water has been evaporated. It may be said that deep\r\nfall plowing, by permitting the moisture to sink quickly into the\r\nlower layers of soil, makes it possible to get upon the ground\r\nearlier in the spring. In fact, unplowed land cannot be cultivated\r\nas early as that which has gone through the winter in a plowed\r\ncondition\r\n\r\nIf the land carries a fall-sown crop, early spring cultivation is\r\ndoubly important. As soon as the plants are well up in spring the\r\nland should be gone over thoroughly several times if necessary, with\r\nan iron tooth harrow, the teeth of which are set to slant backward\r\nin order not to tear up the plants. The loose earth mulch thus\r\nformed is very effective in conserving moisture; and the few plants\r\ntorn up are more than paid for by the increased water supply for the\r\nremaining plants. The wise dry-fanner cultivates his land, whether\r\nfallow or cropped, as early as possible in the spring.\r\n\r\nFollowing the first spring plowing, disking, or cultivation, must\r\ncome more cultivation. Soon after the spring plowing, the land\r\nshould be disked and. then harrowed. Every device should be used to\r\nsecure the formation of a layer of loose drying soil over the land\r\nsurface. The season's crop will depend largely upon the\r\neffectiveness of this spring treatment.\r\n\r\nAs the season advances, three causes combine to permit the\r\nevaporation of soil-moisture.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a natural tendency, under the somewhat moist\r\nconditions of spring, for the soil to settle compactly and thus to\r\nrestore the numerous capillary connections with the lower soil\r\nlayers through which water escapes. Careful watch should therefore\r\nbe kept upon the soil surface, and whenever the mulch is not loose,\r\nthe disk or harrow should be run over the land.\r\n\r\nSecondly, every rain of spring or summer tends to establish\r\nconnections with the store of moisture in the soil. In fact, late\r\nspring and summer rains are often a disadvantage on dry-farms, which\r\nby cultural treatment have been made to contain a large store of\r\nmoisture. It has been shown repeatedly that light rains draw\r\nmoisture very quickly from soil layers many feet below the surface.\r\nThe rainless summer is not feared by the dry-farmer whose soils are\r\nfertile and rich in moisture. It is imperative that at the very\r\nearliest moment after a spring or summer rain the topsoil be well\r\nstirred to prevent evaporation. It thus happens that in sections of\r\nfrequent summer rains, as in the Great Plains area, the farmer has\r\nto harrow his land many times in succession, but the increased crop\r\nyields invariably justify the added expenditure of effort.\r\n\r\nThirdly, on the summer-fallowed ground weeds start vigorously in the\r\nspring and draw upon the soil-moisture, if allowed to grow, fully as\r\nheavily as a crop of wheat or corn. The dry-farmer must not allow a\r\nweed upon his land. Cultivation must he so continuous as to make\r\nweeds an impossibility. The belief that the elements added to the\r\nsoil by weeds offset the loss of soil-moisture is wholly erroneous.\r\nThe growth of weeds on a fallow dry-farm is more dangerous than the\r\npacked uncared-for topsoil. Many implements have been devised for\r\nthe easy killing of weeds, but none appear to be better than the\r\nplow and the disk which are found on every farm. (See Chapter XV.)\r\n\r\nWhen crops are growing on the land, thorough summer cultivation is\r\nsomewhat more difficult, but must be practiced for the greatest\r\ncertainty of crop yields. Potatoes, corn, and similar crops may be\r\ncultivated with comparative ease, by the use of ordinary\r\ncultivators. With wheat and the other small grains, generally, the\r\ndamage done to the crop by harrowing late in the season is too\r\ngreat, and reliance is therefore placed on the shading power of the\r\nplants to prevent undue evaporation. However, until the wheat and\r\nother grains are ten to twelve inches high, it is perfectly safe to\r\nharrow them. The teeth should be set backward to diminish the\r\ntearing up of the plants, and the implement weighted enough to break\r\nthe soil crust thoroughly. This practice has been fully tried out\r\nover the larger part of the dry-farm territory and found\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nSo vitally important is a permanent soil mulch for the conservation\r\nfor plant use of the water stored in the soil that many attempts\r\nhave been made to devise means for the effective cultivation of land\r\non which small grains and grasses are growing. In many places plants\r\nhave been grown in rows so far apart that a man with a hoe could\r\npass between them. Scofield has described this method as practiced\r\nsuccessfully in Tunis. Campbell and others in America have proposed\r\nthat a drill hole be closed every three feet to form a path wide\r\nenough for a horse to travel in and to pull a large spring tooth\r\ncultivator' with teeth so spaced as to strike between the rows of\r\nwheat. It is yet doubtful whether, under average conditions, such\r\ncareful cultivation, at least of grain crops, is justified by the\r\nreturns. Under conditions of high aridity, or where the store of\r\nsoil-moisture is low, such treatment frequently stands between crop\r\nsuccess and failure, and it is not unlikely that methods will be\r\ndevised which will permit of the cheap and rapid cultivation between\r\nthe rows of growing wheat. Meanwhile, the dry-farmer must always\r\nremember that the margin under which he works is small, and that his\r\nsuccess depends upon the degree to which he prevents small wastes.\r\n\r\nDry-farm potatoes, Rosebud Co., Montana, 1909. Yield, 282 bushels\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nThe conservation of soil-moisture depends upon the vigorous,\r\nunremitting, continuous stirring of the topsoil. Cultivation!\r\ncultivation! and more cultivation! must be the war-cry of the\r\ndry-farmer who battles against the water thieves of an arid climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nREGULATING THE TRANSPIRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater that has entered the soil may be lost in three ways. First, it\r\nmay escape by downward seepage, whereby it passes beyond the reach\r\nof plant roots and often reaches the standing water. In dry-farm\r\ndistricts such loss is a rare occurrence, for the natural\r\nprecipitation is not sufficiently large to connect with the country\r\ndrainage, and it may, therefore, be eliminated from consideration.\r\nSecond, soil-water may be lost by direct evaporation from the\r\nsurface soil. The conditions prevailing in arid districts favor\r\nstrongly this manner of loss of soil-moisture. It has been shown,\r\nhowever, in the preceding chapter that the farmer, by proper and\r\npersistent cultivation of the topsoil, has it in his power to reduce\r\nthis loss enough to be almost negligible in the farmer's\r\nconsideration. Third, soil-water may be lost by evaporation from the\r\nplants themselves. While it is not generally understood, this source\r\nof loss is, in districts where dry-farming is properly carried on,\r\nvery much larger than that resulting either from seepage or from\r\ndirect evaporation. While plants are growing, evaporation from\r\nplants, ordinarily called transpiration, continues. Experiments\r\nperformed in various arid districts have shown that one and a half\r\nto three times more water evaporates from the plant than directly\r\nfrom well-tilled soil. To the present very little has been learned\r\nconcerning the most effective methods of checking or controlling\r\nthis continual loss of water. Transpiration, or the evaporation of\r\nwater from the plants themselves and the means of controlling this\r\nloss, are subjects of the deepest importance to the dry-farmer.\r\n\r\nAbsorption\r\n\r\nTo understand the methods for reducing transpiration, as proposed in\r\nthis chapter, it is necessary to review briefly the manner in which\r\nplants take water from the soil. The roots are the organs of water\r\nabsorption. Practically no water is taken into the plants by the\r\nstems or leaves, even under conditions of heavy rainfall. Such small\r\nquantities as may enter the plant through the stems and leaves are\r\nof very little value in furthering the life and growth of the plant.\r\nThe roots alone are of real consequence in water absorption. All\r\nparts of the roots do not possess equal power of taking up\r\nsoil-water. In the process of water absorption the younger roots are\r\nmost active and effective. Even of the young roots, however, only\r\ncertain parts are actively engaged in water absorption. At the very\r\ntips of the young growing roots are numerous fine hairs. These\r\nroot-hairs, which cluster about the growing point of the young\r\nroots, are the organs of the plant that absorb soil-water. They are\r\nof value only for limited periods of time, for as they grow older,\r\nthey lose their power of water absorption. In fact, they are active\r\nonly when they are in actual process of growth. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that water absorption occurs near the tips of the growing\r\nroots, and whenever a plant ceases to grow the water absorption\r\nceases also. The root-hairs are filled with a dilute solution of\r\nvarious substances, as yet poorly understood, which plays an\r\nimportant tent part in the ab sorption of water and plant-food from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nOwing to their minuteness, the root-hairs are in most cases immersed\r\nin the water film that surrounds the soil particles, and the\r\nsoil-water is taken directly into the roots from the soil-water film\r\nby the process known as osmosis. The explanation of this inward\r\nmovement is complicated and need not be discussed here. It is\r\nsufficient to say that the concentration or strength of the solution\r\nwithin the root-hair is of different degree from the soil-water\r\nsolution. The water tends, therefore, to move from the soil into the\r\nroot, in order to make the solutions inside and outside of the root\r\nof the same concentration. If it should ever occur that the\r\nsoil-water and the water within the root-hair became the same\r\nconcentration, that is to say, contained the same substances in the\r\nsame proportional amounts, there would be no further inward movement\r\nof water. Moreover, if it should happen that the soil-water is\r\nstronger than the water within the root-hair, the water would tend\r\nto pass from the plant into the soil. This is the condition that\r\nprevails in many alkali lands of the West, and is the cause of the\r\ndeath of plants growing on such lands.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that under these circumstances not only water enters the\r\nroot-hairs, but many of the substances found in solution in the\r\nsoil-water enter the plant also. Among these are the mineral\r\nsubstances which are indispensable for the proper life and growth of\r\nplants. These plant nutrients are so indispensable that if any one\r\nof them is absent, it is absolutely impossible for the plant to\r\ncontinue its life functions. The indispensable plant-foods gathered\r\nfrom the soil by the root-hairs, in addition to water, are:\r\npotassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, nitrogen, and phosphorus,--all\r\nin their proper combinations. How the plant uses these substances is\r\nyet poorly understood, but we are fairly certain that each one has\r\nsome particular function in the life of the plant. For instance,\r\nnitrogen and phosphorus are probably necessary in the formation of\r\nthe protein or the flesh-forming portions of the plant, while potash\r\nis especially valuable in the formation of starch.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant movement of the indispensable plant nutrients\r\nafter they have entered the root-hairs, through the stems and into\r\nthe leaves. This constant movement of the plant-foods depends upon\r\nthe fact that the plant consumes in its growth considerable\r\nquantities of these substances, and as the plant juices are\r\ndiminished in their content of particular plant-foods, more enters\r\nfrom the soil solution. The necessary plant-foods do not alone enter\r\nthe plant but whatever may be in solution in the soil-water enters\r\nthe plant in variable quantities. Nevertheless, since the plant uses\r\nonly a few definite substances and leaves the unnecessary ones in\r\nsolution, there is soon a cessation of the inward movement of the\r\nunimportant constituents of the soil solution. This process is often\r\nspoken of as selective absorption; that is, the plant, because of\r\nits vital activity, appears to have the power of selecting from the\r\nsoil certain substances and rejecting others.\r\n\r\nMovement of water through plant\r\n\r\nThe soil-water, holding in solution a great variety of plant\r\nnutrients, passes from the root-hairs into the adjoining cells and\r\ngradually moves from cell to cell throughout the whole plant. In\r\nmany plants this stream of water does not simply pass from cell to\r\ncell, but moves through tubes that apparently have been formed for\r\nthe specific purpose of aiding the movement of water through the\r\nplant. The rapidity of this current is often considerable.\r\nOrdinarily, it varies from one foot to six feet per hour, though\r\nobservations are on record showing that the movement often reaches\r\nthe rate of eighteen feet per hour. It is evident, then, that in an\r\nactively growing plant it does not take long for the water which is\r\nin the soil to find its way to the uppermost parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe work of leaves\r\n\r\nWhether water passes upward from cell to cell or through especially\r\nprovided tubes, it reaches at last the leaves, where evaporation\r\ntakes place. It is necessary to consider in greater detail what\r\ntakes place in leaves in order that we may more clearly understand\r\nthe loss due to transpiration. One half or more of every plant is\r\nmade up of the element carbon. The remainder of the plant consists\r\nof the mineral substances taken from the soil (not more than two to\r\n10 per cent of the dry plant) and water which has been combined with\r\nthe carbon and these mineral substances to form the characteristic\r\nproducts of plant life. The carbon which forms over half of the\r\nplant substance is gathered from the air by the leaves and it is\r\nevident that the leaves are very active agents of plant growth. The\r\natmosphere consists chiefly of the gases oxygen and nitrogen in the\r\nproportion of one to four, but associated with them are small\r\nquantities of various other substances. Chief among the secondary\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere is the gas carbon dioxid, which is\r\nformed when carbon burns, that is, when carbon unites with the\r\noxygen of the air. Whenever coal or wood or any carbonaceous\r\nsubstance burns, carbon dioxid is formed. Leaves have the power of\r\nabsorbing the gas carbon dioxid from the air and separating the\r\ncarbon from the oxygen. The oxygen is returned to the atmosphere\r\nwhile the carbon is retained to be used as the fundamental substance\r\nin the construction by the plant of oils, fats, starches, sugars,\r\nprotein, and all the other products of plant growth.\r\n\r\nThis important process known as carbon assimilation is made possible\r\nby the aid of countless small openings which exist chicfly on the\r\nsurfaces of leaves and known as \"stomata.\" The stomata are\r\ndelicately balanced valves, exceedingly sensitive to external\r\ninfluences. They are more numerous on the lower side than on the\r\nupper side of plants. In fact, there is often five times more on the\r\nunder side than on the upper side of a leaf. It has been estimated\r\nthat 150,000 stomata or more are often found per square inch on the\r\nunder side of the leaves of ordinary cultivated plants. The stomata\r\nor breathing-pores are so constructed that they may open and close\r\nvery readily. In wilted leaves they are practically closed; often\r\nthey also close immediately after a rain; but in strong sunlight\r\nthey are usually wide open. It is through the stomata that the gases\r\nof the air enter the plant through which the discarded oxygen\r\nreturns to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is also through the stomata that the water which is drawn from\r\nthe soil by the roots through the stems is evaporated into the air.\r\nThere is some evaporation of water from the stems and branches of\r\nplants, but it is seldom more than a thirtieth or a fortieth of the\r\ntotal transpiration. The evaporation of water from the leaves\r\nthrough the breathing-pores is the so-called transpiration, which is\r\nthe greatest cause of the loss of soil-water under dry-farm\r\nconditions. It is to the prevention of this transpiration that much\r\ninvestigation must be given by future students of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nTranspiration\r\n\r\nAs water evaporates through the breathing-pores from the leaves it\r\nnecessarily follows that a demand is made upon the lower portions of\r\nthe plant for more water. The effect of the loss of water is felt\r\nthroughout the whole plant and is, undoubtedly, one of the chief\r\ncauses of the absorption of water from the soil. As evaporation is\r\ndiminished the amount of water that enters the plants is also\r\ndiminished. Yet transpiration appears to be a process wholly\r\nnecessary for plant life. The question is, simply, to what extent it\r\nmay be diminished without injuring plant growth. Many students\r\nbelieve that the carbon assimilation of the plant, which is\r\nfundamentally important in plant growth, cannot be continued unless\r\nthere is a steady stream of water passing through the plant and then\r\nevaporating from the leaves.\r\n\r\nOf one thing we are fairly sure: if the upward stream of water is\r\nwholly stopped for even a few hours, the plant is likely to be so\r\nseverely injured as to be greatly handicapped in its future growth.\r\n\r\nBotanical authorities agree that transpiration is of value to plant\r\ngrowth, first, because it helps to distribute the mineral nutrients\r\nnecessary for plant growth uniformly throughout the plant; secondly,\r\nbecause it permits an active assimilation of the carbon by the\r\nleaves; thirdly, because it is not unlikely that the heat required\r\nto evaporate water, in large part taken from the plant itself,\r\nprevents the plant from being overheated. This last mentioned value\r\nof transpiration is especially important in dry-farm districts,\r\nwhere, during the summer, the heat is often intense. Fourthly,\r\ntranspiration apparently influences plant growth and development in\r\na number of ways not yet clearly understood.\r\n\r\nConditions influencing transpiration\r\n\r\nIn general, the conditions that determine the evaporation of water\r\nfrom the leaves are the same as those that favor the direct\r\nevaporation of water from soils, although there seems to be\r\nsomething in the life process of the plant, a physiological factor,\r\nwhich permits or prevents the ordinary water-dissipating factors\r\nfrom exercising their full powers. That the evaporation of water\r\nfrom the soil or from a free water surface is not the same as that\r\nfrom plant leaves may be shown in a general way from the fact that\r\nthe amount of water transpired from a given area of leaf surface may\r\nbe very much larger or very much smaller than that evaporated from\r\nan equal surface of free water exposed to the same conditions. It is\r\nfurther shown by the fact that whereas evaporation from a free water\r\nsurface goes on with little or no interruption throughout the\r\ntwenty-four hours of the day, transpiration is virtually at a\r\nstandstill at night even though the conditions for the rapid\r\nevaporation from a free water surface are present.\r\n\r\nSome of the conditions influencing the transpiration may be\r\nenumerated as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, transpiration is influenced by the relative humidity. In dry\r\nair, under otherwise similar conditions, plants transpire more water\r\nthan in moist air though it is to be noted that even when the\r\natmosphere is fully saturated, so that no water evaporates from a\r\nfree water surface, the transpiration of plants still continues in a\r\nsmall degree. This is explained by the observation that since the\r\nlife process of a plant produces a certain amount of heat, the plant\r\nis always warmer than the surrounding air and that transpiration\r\ninto an atmosphere fully charged with water vapor is consequently\r\nmade possible. The fact that transpiration is greater under a low\r\nrelative humidity is of greatest importance to the dry-farmer who\r\nhas to contend with the dry atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSecond, transpiration increases with the increase in temperature;\r\nthat is, under conditions otherwise the same, transpiration is more\r\nrapid on a warm day than on a cold one. The temperature increase of\r\nitself, however, is not sufficient to cause transpiration.\r\n\r\nThird, transpiration increases with the increase of air currents,\r\nwhich is to say, that on a windy day transpiration is much more\r\nrapid than on a quiet day.\r\n\r\nFourth, transpiration increases with the increase of direct\r\nsunlight. It is an interesting observation that even with the same\r\nrelative humidity, temperature, and wind, transpiration is reduced\r\nto a minimum during the night and increases manyfold during the day\r\nwhen direct sunlight is available. This condition is again to be\r\nnoted by the dry-farmer, for the dry-farm districts are\r\ncharacterized by an abundance of sunshine.\r\n\r\nFifth, transpiration is decreased by the presence in the soil-water\r\nof large quantities of the substances which the plant needs for its\r\nfood material. This will be discussed more fully in the next\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nSixth, any mechanical vibration of the plant seems to have some\r\neffect upon the transpiration. At times it is increased and at times\r\nit is decreased by such mechanical disturbance.\r\n\r\nSeventh, transpiration varies also with the age of the plant. In the\r\nyoung plant it is comparatively small. Just before blooming it is\r\nvery much larger and in time of bloom it is the largest in the\r\nhistory of the plant. As the plant grows older transpiration\r\ndiminishes, and finally at the ripening stage it almost ceases.\r\n\r\nEighth, transpiration varies greatly with the crop. Not all plants\r\ntake water from the soil at the same rate. Very little is as yet\r\nknown about the relative water requirements of crops on the basis of\r\ntranspiration. As an illustration, MacDougall has reported that\r\nsagebrush uses about one fourth as much water as a tomato plant.\r\nEven greater differences exist between other plants. This is one of\r\nthe interesting subjects yet to be investigated by those who are\r\nengaged in the reclamation of dry-farm districts. Moreover, the same\r\ncrop grown under different conditions varies in its rate of\r\ntranspiration. For instance, plants grown for some time under arid\r\nconditions greatly modify their rate of transpiration, as shown by\r\nSpalding, who reports that a plant reared under humid conditions\r\ngave off 3.7 times as much water as the same plant reared under arid\r\nconditions. This very interesting observation tends to confirm the\r\nview commonly held that plants grown under arid conditions will\r\ngradually adapt themselves to the prevailing conditions, and in\r\nspite of the greater water dissipating conditions will live with the\r\nexpenditure of less water than would be the case under humid\r\nconditions. Further, Sorauer found, many years ago, that different\r\nvarieties of the same crop possess very different rates of\r\ntranspiration. This also is an interesting subject that should be\r\nmore fully investigated in the future.\r\n\r\nNinth, the vigor of growth of a crop appears to have a strong\r\ninfluence on transpiration. It does not follow, however, that the\r\nmore vigorously a crop grows, the more rapidly does it transpire\r\nwater, for it is well known that the most luxuriant plant growth\r\noccurs in the tropics, where the transpiration is exceedingly low.\r\nIt seems to be true that under the same conditions, plants that grow\r\nmost vigorously tend to use proportionately the smallest amount of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTenth, the root system--its depth and manner of growth--influences\r\nthe rate of transpiration. The more vigorous and extensive the root\r\nsystem, the more rapidly can water be secured from the soil by the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe conditions above enumerated as influencing transpiration are\r\nnearly all of a physical character, and it must not be forgotten\r\nthat they may all be annulled or changed by a physiological\r\nregulation. It must be admitted that the subject of transpiration is\r\nyet poorly understood, though it is one of the most important\r\nsubjects in its applications to plant production in localities where\r\nwater is scaree. It should also be noted that nearly all of the\r\nabove conditions influencing transpiration are beyond the control of\r\nthe farmer. The one that seems most readily controlled in ordinary\r\nagricultural practice will be discussed in the following section.\r\n\r\nPlant-food and transpiration\r\n\r\nIt has been observed repeatedly by students of transpiration that\r\nthe amount of water which actually evaporates from the leaves is\r\nvaried materially by the substances held in solution by the\r\nsoil-water. That is, transpiration depends upon the nature and\r\nconcentration of soil solution. This fact, though not commonly\r\napplied even at the present time, has really been known for a very\r\nlong time. Woodward, in 1699, observed that the amount of water\r\ntranspired by a plant growing in rain water was 192.3 grams; in\r\nspring water, 163.6 grams, and in water from the River Thames, 159.5\r\ngrams; that is, the amount of water transpired by the plant in the\r\ncomparatively pure rain water was nearly 20 per cent higher than\r\nthat used by the plant growing in the notoriously impure water of\r\nthe River Thames. Sachs, in 1859, carried on an elaborate series of\r\nexperiments on transpiration in which he showed that the addition of\r\npotassium nitrate, ammonium sulphate or common salt to the solution\r\nin which plants grew reduced the transpiration; in fact, the\r\nreduction was large, varying from 10 to 75 per cent. This was\r\nconfirmed by a number of later workers, among them, for instance,\r\nBuergerstein, who, in 1875, showed that whenever acids were added to\r\na soil or to water in which plants are growing, the transpiration is\r\nincreased greatly; but when alkalies of any kind are added,\r\ntranspiration decreases. This is of special interest in the\r\ndevelopment of dry-farming, since dry-farm soils, as a rule, contain\r\nmore substances that may be classed as alkalies than do soils\r\nmaintained under humid conditions. Sour soils are very\r\ncharacteristic of districts where the rainfall is abundant; the\r\nvegetation growing on such soils transpires excessively and the\r\ncrops are consequently more subject to drouth.\r\n\r\nThe investigators of almost a generation ago also determined beyond\r\nquestion that whenever a complete nutrient solution is presented to\r\nplants, that is, a solution containing all the necessary plant-foods\r\nin the proper proportions, the transpiration is reduced immensely.\r\nIt is not necessary that the plant-foods should be presented in a\r\nwater solution in order to effect this reduction in transpiration;\r\nif they are added to the soil on which plants are growing, the same\r\neffect will result. The addition of commercial fertilizers to the\r\nsoil will therefore diminish transpiration. It was further\r\ndiscovered nearly half a century ago that similar plants growing on\r\ndifferent soils evaporate different amounts of water from their\r\nleaves; this difference, undoubtedly, is due to the conditions in\r\nthe fertility of the soils, for the more fertile a soil is, the\r\nricher will the soil-water be in the necessary plant-foods. The\r\nprinciple that transpiration or the evaporation of water from the\r\nplants depends on the nature and concentration of the soil solution\r\nis of far-reaching importance in the development of a rational\r\npractice of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nTranspiration for a pound of dry matter\r\n\r\nIs plant growth proportional to transpiration? Do plants that\r\nevaporate much water grow more rapidly than those that evaporate\r\nless? These questions arose very early in the period characterized\r\nby an active study of transpiration. If varying the transpiration\r\nvaries the growth, there would be no special advantage in reducing\r\nthe transpiration. From an economic point of view the important\r\nquestion is this: Does the plant when its rate of transpiration is\r\nreduced still grow with the same vigor? If that be the case, then\r\nevery effort should be made by the farmer to control and to diminish\r\nthe rate of transpiration.\r\n\r\nOne of the very earliest experiments on transpiration, conducted by\r\nWoodward in 1699, showed that it required less water to produce a\r\npound of dry matter if the soil solution were of the proper\r\nconcentration and contained the elements necessary for plant growth.\r\nLittle more was done to answer the above questions for over one\r\nhundred and fifty years. Perhaps the question was not even asked\r\nduring this period, for scientific agriculture was just coming into\r\nbeing in countries where the rainfall was abundant. However,\r\nTschaplowitz, in 1878, investigated the subject and found that the\r\nincrease in dry matter is greatest when the transpiration is the\r\nsmallest. Sorauer, in researches conducted from 1880 to 1882,\r\ndetermined with almost absolute certainty that less water is\r\nrequired to produce a pound of dry matter when the soil is\r\nfertilized than when it is not fertilized. Moreover, he observed\r\nthat the enriching of the soil solution by the addition of\r\nartificial fertilizers enabled the plant to produce dry matter with\r\nless water. He further found that if a soil is properly tilled so as\r\nto set free plant-food and in that way to enrich the soil solution\r\nthe water-cost of dry plant substance is decreased. Hellriegel, in\r\n1883, confirmed this law and laid down the law that poor plant\r\nnutrition increases the water-cost of every pound of dry matter\r\nproduced. It was about this time that the Rothamsted Experiment\r\nStation reported that its experiments had shown that during periods\r\nof drouth the well-tilled and well-fertilized fields yielded good\r\ncrops, while the unfertilized fields yielded poor crops or crop\r\nfailures--indicating thereby, since rainfall was the critical\r\nfactor, that the fertility of the soil is important in determining\r\nwhether or not with a small amount of water a good crop can be\r\nproduced. Pagnoul, working in 1895 with fescue grass, arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion. On a poor clay soil it required 1109 pounds of\r\nwater to produce one pound of dry matter, while on a rich calcareous\r\nsoil only 574 pounds were required. Gardner of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Bureau of Soils, working in 1908, on the\r\nmanuring of soils, came to the conclusion that the more fertile the\r\nsoil the less water is required to produce a pound of dry matter. He\r\nincidentally called attention to the fact that in countries of\r\nlimited rainfall this might be a very important principle to apply\r\nin crop production. Hopkins in his study of the soils of Illinois\r\nhas repeatedly observed, in connection with certain soils, that\r\nwhere the land is kept fertile, injury from drouth is not common,\r\nimplying thereby that fertile soils will produce dry matter at a\r\nlower water-cost. The most recent experiments on this subject,\r\nconducted by the Utah Station, confirm these conclusions. The\r\nexperiments, which covered several years, were conducted in pots\r\nfilled with different soils. On a soil, naturally fertile, 908\r\npounds of water were transpired for each pound of dry matter (corn)\r\nproduced; by adding to this soil an ordinary dressing of manure'\r\nthis was reduced to 613 pounds, and by adding a small amount of\r\nsodium nitrate it was reduced to 585 pounds. If so large a reduction\r\ncould be secured in practice, it would seem to justify the use of\r\ncommercial fertilizers in years when the dry-farm year opens with\r\nlittle water stored in the soil. Similar results, as will be shown\r\nbelow, were obtained by the use of various cultural methods. It may\r\ntherefore, be stated as a law, that any cultural treatment which\r\nenables the soil-water to acquire larger quantities of plant-food\r\nalso enables the plant to produce dry matter with the use of a\r\nsmaller amount of water. In dry-farming, where the limiting factor\r\nis water, this principle must he emphasized in every cultural\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nMethods of controlling transpiration\r\n\r\nIt would appear that at present the only means possessed by the\r\nfarmer for controlling transpiration and making possible maximum\r\ncrops with the minimum amount of water in a properly tilled soil is\r\nto keep the soil as fertile as is possible. In the light of this\r\nprinciple the practices already recommended for the storing of water\r\nand for the prevention of the direct evaporation of water from the\r\nsoil are again emphasized. Deep and frequent plowing, preferably in\r\nthe fall so that the weathering of the winter may be felt deeply and\r\nstrongly, is of first importance in liberating plant-food.\r\nCultivation which has been recommended for the prevention of the\r\ndirect evaporation of water is of itself an effective factor in\r\nsetting free plant-food and thus in reducing the amount of water\r\nrequired by plants. The experiments at the Utah Station, already\r\nreferred to, bring out very strikingly the value of cultivation in\r\nreducing the transpiration. For instance, in a series of experiments\r\nthe following results were obtained. On a sandy loam, not\r\ncultivated, 603 pounds of water were transpired to produce one pound\r\nof dry matter of corn; on the same soil, cultivated, only 252 pounds\r\nwere required. On a clay loam, not cultivated, 535 pounds of water\r\nwere transpired for each pound of dry matter, whereas on the\r\ncultivated soil only 428 pounds were necessary. On a clay soil, not\r\ncultivated, 753 pounds of water were transpired for each pound of\r\ndry matter; on the cultivated soil, only 582 pounds. The farmer who\r\nfaithfully cultivates the soil throughout the summer and after every\r\nrain has therefore the satisfaction of knowing that he is\r\naccomplishing two very important things: he is keeping the moisture\r\nin the soil, and he is making it possible for good crops to be grown\r\nwith much less water than would otherwise be required. Even in the\r\ncase of a peculiar soil on which ordinary cultivation did not reduce\r\nthe direct evaporation, the effect upon the transpiration was very\r\nmarked. On the soil which was not cultivated, 451 pounds of water\r\nwere required to produce one pound of dry matter (corn), while on\r\nthe cultivated soils, though the direct evaporation was no smaller,\r\nthe number of pounds of water for each pound of dry substance was as\r\nlow as 265.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief values of fallowing lies in the liberation of the\r\nplant-food during the fallow year, which reduces the quantity of\r\nwater required the next year for the full growth of crops. The Utah\r\nexperiments to which reference has already been made show the effect\r\nof the previous soil treatment upon the water requirements of crops.\r\nOne half of the three types of soil had been cropped for three\r\nsuccessive years, while the other half had been left bare. During\r\nthe fourth year both halves were planted to corn. For the sandy loam\r\nit was found that, on the part that had been cropped previously, 659\r\npounds of water were required for each pound of dry matter produced,\r\nwhile on the part that had been bare only 573 pounds were required.\r\nFor the clay loam 889 pounds on the cropped part and 550 on the\r\npreviously bare part were required for each pound of dry matter. For\r\nthe clay 7466 pounds on the cropped part and 1739 pounds on the\r\npreviously bare part were required for each pound of dry matter.\r\nThese results teach clearly and emphatically that the fertile\r\ncondition of the soil induced by fallowing makes it possible to\r\nproduce dry matter with a smaller amount of water than can be done\r\non soils that are cropped continuously. The beneficial effects of\r\nfallowing are therefore clearly twofold: to store the moisture of\r\ntwo seasons for the use of one crop; and to set free fertility to\r\nenable the plant to grow with the least amount of water. It is not\r\nyet fully understood what changes occur in fallowing to give the\r\nsoil the fertility which reduces the water needs of the plant. The\r\nresearches of Atkinson in Montana, Stewart and Graves in Utah, and\r\nJensen in South Dakota make it seem probable that the formation of\r\nnitrates plays an important part in the whole process. If a soil is\r\nof such a nature that neither careful, deep plowing at the right\r\ntime nor constant crust cultivation are sufficient to set free an\r\nabundance of plant-food, it may be necessary to apply manures or\r\ncommercial fertilizers to the soil. While the question of restoring\r\nsoil fertility has not yet come to be a leading one in dry-farming,\r\nyet in view of what has been said in this chapter it is not\r\nimpossible that the time will come when the farmers must give\r\nprimary attention to soil fertility in addition to the storing and\r\nconservation of soil-moisture. The fertilizing of lands with proper\r\nplant-foods, as shown in the last sections, tends to check\r\ntranspiration and makes possible the production of dry matter at the\r\nlowest water-cost.\r\n\r\nThe recent practice in practically all dry-farm districts, at least\r\nin the intermountain and far West, to use the header for harvesting\r\nbears directly upon the subject considered in this chapter. The high\r\nstubble which remains contains much valuable plant-food, often\r\ngathered many feet below the surface by the plant roots. When this\r\nstubble is plowed under there is a valuable addition of the\r\nplant-food to the upper soil. Further, as the stubble decays, acid\r\nsubstances are produced that act upon the soil grains to set free\r\nthe plant-food locked up in them. The plowing under of stubble is\r\ntherefore of great value to the dry-farmer. The plowing under of any\r\nother organic substance has the same effect. In both cases fertility\r\nis concentrated near the surface, which dissolves in the soil-water\r\nand enables the crop to mature with the Ieast quantity of water.\r\n\r\nThe lesson then to be learned from this chapter is, that it is not\r\naufficient for the dry-farmer to store an abundance of water in the\r\nsoil and to prevent that water from evaporating directly from the\r\nsoil; but the soil must be kept in such a state of high fertility\r\nthat plants are enabled to utilize the stored moisture in the most\r\neconomical manner. Water storage, the prevention of evaporation, and\r\nthe maintenance of soil fertility go hand in hand in the development\r\nof a successful system of farming without irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPLOWING AND FALLOWING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil treatment prescribed in the preceding chapters rests upon\r\n(1) deep and thorough plowing, done preferably in the fall; (2)\r\nthorough cultivation to form a mulch over the surface of the land,\r\nand (3) clean summer fallowing every other year under low rainfall\r\nor every third or fourth year under abundant rainfall.\r\n\r\nStudents of dry-farming all agree that thorough cultivation of the\r\ntopsoil prevents the evaporation of soil-moisture, but some have\r\nquestioned the value of deep and fall plowing and the occasional\r\nclean summer fallow. It is the purpose of this chapter to state the\r\nfindings of practical men with reference to the value of plowing and\r\nfallowing in producing large crop yields under dry-farm conditions.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown in Chapter XVIII that the first attempts to produce\r\ncrops without irrigation under a limited rainfall were made\r\nindependently in many diverse places. California, Utah, and the\r\nColumbia Basin, as far as can now be learned, as well as the Great\r\nPlains area, were all independent pioneers in the art of\r\ndry-farming. It is a most significant fact that these diverse\r\nlocalities, operating under different conditions as to soil and\r\nclimate, have developed practically the same system of dry-farming.\r\nIn all these places the best dry-farmers practice deep plowing\r\nwherever the subsoil will permit it; fall plowing wherever the\r\nclimate will permit it; the sowing of fall grain wherever the\r\nwinters will permit it, and the clean summer fallow every other\r\nyear, or every third or fourth year. H. W. Campbell, who has been\r\nthe leading exponent of dry-farming in the Great Plains area, began\r\nhis work without the clean summer fallow as a part of his system,\r\nbut has long since adopted it for that section of the country. It is\r\nscarcely to be believed that these practices, developed laboriously\r\nthrough a long succession of years in widely separated localities,\r\ndo not rest upon correct scientific principles. In any case, the\r\naccumulated experience of the dry-farmers in this country confirms\r\nthe doctrines of soil tillage for dry-farms laid down in the\r\npreceding chapters.\r\n\r\nAt the Dry-Farming Congresses large numbers of practical farmers\r\nassemble for the purpose of exchanging experiences and views. The\r\nreports of the Congress show a great difference of opinion on minor\r\nmatters and a wonderful unanimity of opinion on the more fundamental\r\nquestions. For instance, deep plowing was recommended by all who\r\ntouched upon the subject in their remarks; though one farmer, who\r\nlived in a locality the subsoil of which was very inert, recommended\r\nthat the depth of plowing should be increased gradually until the\r\nfull depth is reached, to avoid a succession of poor crop years\r\nwhile the lifeless soil was being vivified. The states of Utah,\r\nMontana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and the\r\nprovinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan of Canada all specifically\r\ndeclared through one to eight representatives from each state in\r\nfavor of deep plowing as a fundamental practice in dry-farming. Fall\r\nplowing, wherever the climatic conditions make it possible, was\r\nsimilarly advocated by all the speakers. Farmers in certain\r\nlocalities had found the soil so dry in the fall that plowing was\r\ndifficult, but Campbell insisted that even in such places it would\r\nbe profitable to use power enough to break up the land before the\r\nwinter season set in. Numerous speakers from the states of Utah,\r\nWyoming, Montana, Nebraska, and a number of the Great Plains states,\r\nas well as from the Chinese Empire, declared themselves as favoring\r\nfall plowing. Scareely a dissenting voice was raised.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the clean summer fallow as a vital principle of\r\ndry-farming a slight difference of opinion was discovered. Farmers\r\nfrom some of the localities insisted that the clean summer fallow\r\nevery other year was indispensable; others that one in three years\r\nwas sufficient; and others one in four years, and a few doubtful the\r\nwisdom of it altogether. However, all the speakers agreed that clean\r\nand thorough cultivation should be practiced faithfully during the\r\nspring, and fall of the fallow year. The appreciation of the fact\r\nthat weeds consume precious moisture and fertility seemed to be\r\ngeneral among the dry-farmers from all sections of the country. The\r\nfollowing states, provinces, and countries declared themselves as\r\nbeing definitely and emphatically in favor of clean summer\r\nfallowing:\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, New\r\nMexico, North Dakota, Nebraska, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Russia,\r\nTurkey, the Transvaal, Brazil, and Australia. Each of these many\r\ndistricts was represented by one to ten or more representatives. The\r\nonly state to declare somewhat vigorously against it was from the\r\nGreat Plains area, and a warning voice was heard from the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture. The recorded practical experience\r\nof the farmers over the whole of the dry-farm territory of the\r\nUnited States leads to the conviction that fallowing must he\r\naccepted as a practice which resulted in successful dry-farming.\r\nFurther, the experimental leaders in the dry-farm movement, whether\r\nworking under private, state, or governmental direction, are, with\r\nvery few exceptions, strongly in favor of deep fall plowing and\r\nclean summer fallowing as parts of the dry-farm system.\r\n\r\nThe chief reluctance to accept clean summer fallowing as a principle\r\nof dry-farming appears chicfly among students of the Great Plains\r\narea. Even there it is admitted by all that a wheat crop following a\r\nfallow year is larger and better than one following wheat. There\r\nseem, however, to be two serious reasons for objecting to it. First,\r\na fear that a clean summer fallow, practiced every second, third, or\r\nfourth year, will cause a large diminution of the organic matter in\r\nthe soil, resulting finally in complete crop failure; and second, a\r\nbelief that a hoed crop, like corn or potatoes, exerts the same\r\nbeneficial effect.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that the thorough tillage involved in\r\ndry-farming exposes to the action of the elements the organic matter\r\nof the soil and thereby favors rapid oxidation. For that reason the\r\ndifferent ways in which organic matter may be supplied regularly to\r\ndry-farms are pointed out in Chapter XIV. It may also be observed\r\nthat the header harvesting system employed over a large part of the\r\ndry-farm territory leaves the large header stubble to be plowed\r\nunder, and it is probable that under such methods more organic\r\nmatter is added to the soil during the year of cropping than is lost\r\nduring the year of fallowing. It may, moreover, be observed that\r\nthorough tillage of a crop like corn or potatoes tends to cause a\r\nloss of the organic matter of the soil to a degree nearly as large\r\nas is the case when a fallow field is well cultivated. The thorough\r\nstirring of the soil under an arid or semiarid climate, which is an\r\nessential feature of dry-farming, will always result in a decrease\r\nin organic matter. It matters little whether the soil is fallow or\r\nin crop during the process of cultivation, so far as the result is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nA serious matter connected with fallowing in the Great Plains area\r\nis the blowing of the loose well-tilled soil of the fallow fields,\r\nwhich results from the heavy winds that blow so steadily over a\r\nlarge part of the western slope of the Mississippi Valley. This is\r\nlargely avoided when crops are grown on the land, even when it is\r\nwell tilled.\r\n\r\nThe theory, recently proposed, that in the Great Plains area, where\r\nthe rains come chicfly in summer, the growing of hoed crops may take\r\nthe place of the summer fallow, is said to be based on experimental\r\ndata not yet published. Careful and conscientious experimenters, as\r\nChilcott and his co-laborers, indicate in their statements that in\r\nmany cases the yields of wheat, after a hoed crop, have been larger\r\nthan after a fallow year. The doctrine has, therefore, been rather\r\nwidely disseminated that fallowing has no place in the dry-farming\r\nof the Great Plains area and should be replaced by the growing of\r\nhoed crops. Chilcott, who is the chief exponent of this doctrine,\r\ndeclares, however, that it is only with spring-grown crops and for a\r\nsuccession of normal years that fallowing may be omitted, and that\r\nfallowing must be resorted to as a safeguard or temporary expedient\r\nto guard against total loss of crop where extreme drouth is\r\nanticipated; that is, where the rainfall falls below the average. He\r\nfurther explains that continuous grain cropping, even with careful\r\nplowing and spring and fall tillage, is unsuccessful; but holds that\r\ncertain rotations of crops, including grain and a hoed crop every\r\nother year, are often more profitable than grain alternating with\r\nclean summer fallow. He further believes that the fallow year every\r\nthird or fourth year is sufficient for Great Plains conditions.\r\nJardine explains that whenever fall grain is grown in the Great\r\nPlains area, the fallow is remarkably helpful, and in fact because\r\nof the dry winters is practically indispensable.\r\n\r\nThis latter view is confirmed by the experimental results obtained\r\nby Atkinson and others at the Montana Experiment Stations, which are\r\nconducted under approximately Great Plains conditions.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned also that in Saskatchewan, in the north end\r\nof the Great Plains area, and which is characteristic, except for a\r\nlower annual temperature, of the whole area, and where dry-farming\r\nhas been practiced for a quarter of a century, the clean summer\r\nfallow has come to be an established practice.\r\n\r\nThis recent discussion of the place of fallowing in the agriculture\r\nof the Great Plains area illustrates what has been said so often in\r\nthis volume about the adapting of principles to local conditions.\r\nWherever the summer rainfall is sufficient to mature a crop,\r\nfallowing for the purpose of storing moisture in the soil is\r\nunnecessary; the only value of the fallow year under such conditions\r\nwould be to set free fertility. In the Great Plains area the\r\nrainfall is somewhat higher than elsewhere in the dry-farm territory\r\nand most of it comes in summer; and the summer precipitation is\r\nprobably enough in average years to mature crops, providing soil\r\nconditions are favorable. The main considerations, then, are to keep\r\nthe soils open for the reception of water and to maintain the soils\r\nin a sufficiently fertile condition to produce, as explained in\r\nChapter IX, plants with a minimum amount of water. This is\r\naccomplished very largely by the year of hoed crop, when the soil is\r\nas well stirred as under a clean fallow.\r\n\r\nThe dry-farmer must never forget that the critical element in\r\ndry-farming is water and that the annual rainfall will in the very\r\nnature of things vary from year to year, with the result that the\r\ndry year, or the year with a precipitation below the average, is\r\nsure to come. In somewhat wet years the moisture stored in the soil\r\nis of comparatively little consequence, but in a year of drouth it\r\nwill be the main dependence of the farmer. Now, whether a crop be\r\nhoed or not, it requires water for its growth, and land which is\r\ncontinuously cropped even with a variety of crops is likely to be so\r\nlargely depleted of its moisture that, when the year of drouth\r\ncomes, failure will probably result.\r\n\r\nThe precariousness of dry-farming must be done away with. The year\r\nof drouth must be expected every year. Only as certainty of crop\r\nyield is assured will dry-farming rise to a respected place by the\r\nside of other branches of agriculture. To attain such certainty and\r\nrespect clean summer fallowing every second, third, or fourth year,\r\naccording to the average rainfall, is probably indispensable; and\r\nfuture investigations, long enough continued, will doubtless confirm\r\nthis prediction. Undoubtedly, a rotation of crops, including hoed\r\ncrops, will find an important place in dry-farming, but probably not\r\nto the complete exclusion of the clean summer fallow.\r\n\r\nJethro Tull, two hundred years ago, discovered that thorough tillage\r\nof the soil gave crops that in some cases could not be produced by\r\nthe addition of manure, and he came to the erroneous conclusion that\r\n\"tillage is manure.\" In recent days we have learned the value of\r\ntillage in conserving moisture and in enabling plants to reach\r\nmaturity with the least amount of water, and we may be tempted to\r\nbelieve that \"tillage is moisture.\" This, like Tull's statement, is\r\na fallacy and must be avoided. Tillage can take the place of\r\nmoisture only to a limited degree. Water is the essential\r\nconsideration in dry-farming, else there would be no dry-farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSOWING AND HARVESTING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe careful application of the principles of soil treatment\r\ndiscussed in the preceding chapters will leave the soil in good\r\ncondition for sowing, either in the fall or spring. Nevertheless,\r\nthough proper dry-farming insures a first-class seed-bed, the\r\nproblem of sowing is one of the most difficult in the successful\r\nproduction of crops without irrigation. This is chiefly due to the\r\ndifficulty of choosing, under somewhat rainless conditions, a time\r\nfor sowing that will insure rapid and complete germination and the\r\nestablishmcnt of a root system capable of producing good plants. In\r\nsome respects fewer definite, reliable principles can be laid down\r\nconcerning sowing than any other principle of important application\r\nin the practice of dry-farming. The experience of the last fifteen\r\nyears has taught that the occasional failures to which even good\r\ndry-farmers have been subjected have been caused almost wholly by\r\nuncontrollable unfavorable conditions prevailing at the time of\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\nConditions of germination\r\n\r\nThree conditions determine germination: (1) heat, (2) oxygen, and\r\n(3) water. Unless these three conditions are all favorable, seeds\r\ncannot germinate properly. The first requisite for successful seed\r\ngermination is a proper degree of heat. For every kind of seed there\r\nis a temperature below which germination does not occur; another,\r\nabove which it does not occur, and another, the best, at which,\r\nproviding the other factors are favorable, germination will go on\r\nmost rapidly. The following table, constructed by Goodale, shows the\r\nlatest, highest, and best germination temperatures for wheat,\r\nbarley, and corn. Other seeds germinate approximately within the\r\nsame ranges of temperature:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGermination Temperatures (Degrees Farenheit)\r\n\r\n       Lowest  Highest  Best\r\nWheat  41      108      84\r\nBarley 41      100      84\r\nCorn   49      115      91\r\n\r\n\r\nGermination occurs within the considerable range between the highest\r\nand lowest temperatures of this table, though the rapidity of\r\ngermination decreases as the temperature recedes from the best. This\r\nexplains the early spring and late fall germination when the\r\ntemperature is comparatively low. If the temperature falls below the\r\nlowest required for germination, dry seeds are not injured, and even\r\na temperature far below the freezing point of water will not affect\r\nseeds unfavorably if they are not too moist. The warmth of the soil,\r\nessential to germination, cannot well be controlled by the farmer;\r\nand planting must, therefore, be done in seasons when, from past\r\nexperience, it is probable that the temperature is and will remain\r\nin the neighborhood of the best degree for germination. More heat is\r\nrequired to raise the temperature of wet soils; therefore, seeds\r\nwill generally germinate more slowly in wet than in dry soils, as is\r\nillustrated in the rapid germination often observed in well-tilled\r\ndry-farm soils. Consequently, it is safer at a low temperature to\r\nsow in dry soils than in wet ones. Dark soils absorb heat more\r\nrapidly than lighter colored ones, and under the same conditions of\r\ntemperature germination is therefore more likely to go on rapidly in\r\ndark colored soils. Over the dry-farm territory the soils are\r\ngenerally light colored, which would tend to delay germination. The\r\nincorporation of organic matter with the soil, which tends to darken\r\nthe soil, has a slight though important bearing on germination as\r\nwell as on the general fertility of the soil, and should be made an\r\nimportant dry-farm practice. Meanwhile, the temperature of the soil\r\ndepends almost wholly upon the prevailing temperature conditions in\r\nthe district and is not to any material degree under the control of\r\nthe farmer.\r\n\r\nA sufficient supply of oxygen in the soil is indispensable to\r\ngermination. Oxygen, as is well known, forms about one fifth of the\r\natmosphere and is the active principle in combustion and in tile\r\nchanges in the animal body occasioned by respiration. Oxygen should\r\nbe present in the soil air in approximately the proportion in which\r\nit is found in the atmosphere. Germination is hindered by a larger\r\nor smaller proportion than is found in the atmosphere. The soil must\r\nbe in such a condition that the air can easily enter or leave the\r\nupper soil layer; that is, the soil must be somewhat loose. In order\r\nthat the seeds may have access to the necessary oxygen, then, sowing\r\nshould not be done in wet or packed soils, nor should the sowing\r\nimplements be such as to press the soil too closely around the\r\nseeds. Well-fallowed soil is in an ideal condition for admitting\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature is right, germination begins by the forcible\r\nabsorption of water by the seed from the surrounding soil. The force\r\nof this absorption is very great, ranging from four hundred to five\r\nhundred pounds per square inch, and continues until the seed is\r\ncompletely saturated. The great vigor with which water is thus\r\nabsorbed from the soil explains how seeds are able to secure the\r\nnecessary water from the thin water film surrounding the soil\r\ngrains. The following table, based upon numerous investigations\r\nconducted in Germany and in Utah, shows the maximum percentages of\r\nwater contained by seeds when the absorption is complete. These\r\nquantities are reached only when water is easily accessible:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPercentage of Water contained by Seeds at Saturation\r\n\r\n       German  Utah\r\nRye    58      --\r\nWheat  57      52\r\nOats   58      43\r\nBarley 56      44\r\nCorn   44      57\r\nBeans  95      88\r\nLucern 78      67\r\n\r\n\r\nGermination itself does not go on freely until this maximum\r\nsaturation has been reached. Therefore, if the moisture in the soil\r\nis low, the absorption of water is made difficult and germination is\r\nretarded. This shows itself in a decreased percentage of\r\ngermination. The effect upon germination of the percentage of water\r\nin the soil is well shown by some of the Utah experiments, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of Varying Amounts of Water on Percentage of Germination\r\n\r\nPercent water in soil  7.5  10  12.5  15  17.5  20  22.5  25\r\nWheat in sandy loam    0.0  98  94    86  82    82  82    6\r\nWheat in clay          30   48  84    94  84    82  86    58\r\nBeans in sandy loam    0    0   20    46  66    18  8     9\r\nBeans in clay          0    0   6     20  22    32  30    36\r\nLucern in Sandy loam   0    18  68    54  54    8   8     9\r\nLucern in clay         8    8   54    48  50    32  15    14\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a sandy soil a small percentage of water will cause better\r\ngermination than in a clay soil. While different seeds vary in their\r\npower to abstract water from soils, yet it seems that for the\r\nmajority of plants, the best percentage of soil-water for\r\ngermination purposes is that which is in the neighborhood of the\r\nmaximum field capacity of soils for water, as explained in Chapter\r\nVII. Bogdanoff has estimated that the best amount of water in the\r\nsoil for germination purposes is about twice the maximum percentage\r\nof hygroscopic water. This would not be far from the field-water\r\ncapacity as described in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nDuring the absorption of water, seeds swell considerably, in many\r\ncases from two to three times their normal size. This has the very\r\ndesirable effect of crowding the seed walls against the soil\r\nparticles and thus, by establishing more points of contact, enabling\r\nthe seed to absorb moisture with greater facility. As seeds begin to\r\nabsorb water, heat is also produced. In many cases the temperature\r\nsurrounding the seeds is increased one degree on the Centigrade\r\nscale by the mere process of water absorption. This favors rapid\r\ngermination. Moreover, the fertility of the soil has a direct\r\ninfluence upon germination. In fertile soils the germination is more\r\nrapid and more complete than in infertile soils. Especially active\r\nin favoring direct germination are the nitrates. When it is recalled\r\nthat the constant cultivation and well-kept summer fallow of\r\ndry-farming develop large quantities of nitrates in the soil, it\r\nwill be understood that the methods of dry-farming as already\r\noutlined accelerate germination very greatly.\r\n\r\nIt scareely need be said that the soil of the seed-bed should be\r\nfine, mellow, and uniform in physical texture so that the seeds can\r\nbe planted evenly and in close contact with the soil particles. All\r\nthe requisite conditions for germination are best met by the\r\nconditions prevailing in a well-kept summer fallowed soil.\r\n\r\nTime to sow\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the time to sow, the first question to be\r\ndisposed of by the dry-farmer is that of fall as against spring\r\nsowing. The small grains occur as fall and spring varieties, and it\r\nis vitally important to determine which season, under dry-farm\r\nconditions, is the best for sowing.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of fall sowing are many. As stated, successful\r\ngermination is favored by the presence of an abundance of fertility,\r\nespecially of nitrates, in the soil. In summer-fallowed land\r\nnitrates are always found in abundance in the fall, ready to\r\nstimulate the seed into rapid germination and the young plants into\r\nvigorous growth. During the late fall and winter months the nitrates\r\ndisappear, at least in part, anti from the point of view of\r\nfertility the spring is not so desirable as the fall for\r\ngermination. More important, grain sown in the fall under favorable\r\nconditions will establish a good root system which is ready for use\r\nand in action in the early spring as soon as the temperature is\r\nright and long before the farmer can go out on the ground with his\r\nimplements. As a result, the crop has the use of the early spring\r\nmoisture, which under the conditions of spring sowing is evaporated\r\ninto the air. Where the natural precipitation is light and the\r\namount of water stored in the soil is not large, the gain resulting\r\nfrom the use of the early spring moisture. often decides the\r\nquestion in favor of fall sowing.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of fall sowing are also many. The uncertainty of\r\nthe fall rains must first be considered. In ordinary practice, seed\r\nsown in the fall does not germinate until a rain comes, unless\r\nindeed sowing is done immediately after a rain. The fall rains are\r\nuncertain as to quantity. In many cases they are so light that they\r\nsuffice only to start germination and not to complete it and give\r\nthe plants the proper start. Such incomplete germination frequently\r\ncauses the total loss of the crop. Even if the stand of the fall\r\ncrop is satisfactory, there is always the danger of winter-killing\r\nto be reckoned with. The real cause of winter-killing is not yet\r\nclearly understood, though it seems that repeated thawing and\r\nfreezing, drying winter winds, accompanied by dry cold or protracted\r\nperiods of intense cold, destroy the vitality of the seed and young\r\nroot system. Continuous but moderate cold is not ordinarily very\r\ninjurious. The liability to winter-killing is, therefore, very much\r\ngreater wherever the winters are open than in places where the snow\r\ncovers the ground the larger part of the winter. It is also to be\r\nkept in mind that some varieties are very resistant to\r\nwinter-killing, while others require well-covered winters. Fall\r\nsowing is preferable wherever the bulk of the precipitation comes in\r\nwinter and spring and where the winters are covered for some time\r\nwith snow and the summers are dry. Under such conditions it is very\r\nimportant that the crop make use of the moisture stored in the soil\r\nin the early spring. Wherever the precipitation comes largely in\r\nlate spring and summer, the arguments in favor of fall sowing are\r\nnot so strong, and in such localities spring sowing is often more\r\ndesirable than fall sowing. In the Great Plains district, therefore,\r\nspring sowing is usually recommended, though fall-sown crops nearly\r\nalways, even there, yield the larger crops. In the intermountain\r\nstates, with wet winters and dry summers, fall sowing has almost\r\nwholly replaced spring sowing. In fact, Farrell reports that upon\r\nthe Nephi (Utah) substation the average of six years shows about\r\ntwenty bushels of wheat from fall-sown seed as against about\r\nthirteen bushels from spring-sown seed. Under the California\r\nclimate, with wet winters and a winter temperature high enough for\r\nplant growth, fall sowing is also a general practice. Wherever the\r\nconditions are favorable, fall sowing should be practiced, for it is\r\nin harmony with the best principles of water conservation. Even in\r\ndistricts where the precipitation comes chiefly in the summer, it\r\nmay be found that fall sowing, after all, is preferable.\r\n\r\nThe right time to sow in the fall can be fixed only with great\r\ndifficulty, for so much depends upon the climatic conditions. In\r\nfact the practice varies in accordance with differences in fall\r\nprecipitation and early fall frosts. Where numerous fall rains\r\nmaintain the soil in a fairly moist condition and the temperature is\r\nnot too low, the problem is comparatively simple. In such districts,\r\nfor latitudes represented by the dry-farm sections of the United\r\nStates, a good time for fall planting is ordinarily from the first\r\nof September to the middle of October. If sown much earlier in such\r\ndistricts, the growth is likely to be too rank and subject to\r\ndangerous injury by frosts, and as suggested by Farrell the very\r\nlarge development of the root system in the fall may cause, the\r\nfollowing summer, a dangerously large growth of foliage; that is,\r\nthe crop may run to straw at the expense of the grain. If sown much\r\nlater, the chances are that the crop will not possess sufficient\r\nvitality to withstand the cold of late fall and winter. In\r\nlocalities where the late summer and the early fall are rainless, it\r\nis much more difficult to lay down a definite rule covering the time\r\nof fall sowing. The dry-farmers in such places usually sow at any\r\nconvenient time in the hope that an early rain will start the\r\nprocess of germination and growth. In other cases planting is\r\ndelayed until the arrival of the first fall rain. This is an certain\r\nand usually unsatisfactory practice, since it often happens that the\r\nsowing is delayed until too late in the fall for the best results.\r\n\r\nIn districts of dry late summer and fall, the greatest danger in\r\ndepending upon the fall rains for germination lies in the fact that\r\nthe precipitation is often so small that it initiates germination\r\nwithout being sufficient to complete it. This means that when the\r\nseed is well started in germination, the moisture gives out. When\r\nanother slight rain comes a little later, germination is again\r\nstarted and possibly again stopped. In some seasons this may occur\r\nseveral times, to the permanent injury of the crop. Dry-farmers try\r\nto provide against this danger by using an unusually large amount of\r\nseed, assuming that a certain amount will fail to come up because of\r\nthe repeated partial germinations. A number of investigators have\r\ndemonstrated that a seed may start to germinate, then be dried, and\r\nagain be started to germinate several times in succession without\r\nwholly destroying the vitality of the seed.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments wheat and other seeds were allowed to germinate\r\nand dry seven times in succession. With each partial germination the\r\npercentage of total germination decreased until at the seventh\r\ngermination only a few seeds of wheat, barley, and oats retained\r\ntheir power. This, however, is practically the condition in dry-farm\r\ndistricts with rainless summers and falls, where fall seeding is\r\npracticed. In such localities little dependence should be placed on\r\nthe fall rains and greater reliance placed on a method of soil\r\ntreatment that will insure good germination. For this purpose the\r\nsummer fallow has been demonstrated to be the most desirable\r\npractice. If the soil has been treated according to the principles\r\nlaid down in earlier chapters, the fallowed land will, in the fall,\r\ncontain a sufficient amount of moisture to produce complete\r\ngermination though no rains may fall. Under such conditions the main\r\nconsideration is to plant the seed so deep that it may draw freely\r\nupon the stored soil-moisture. This method makes fall germination\r\nsure in districts where the natural precipitation is not to be\r\ndepended upon.\r\n\r\nWhen sowing is done in the spring, there are few factors to\r\nconsider. Whenever the temperature is right and the soil has dried\r\nout sufficiently so that agricultural implements may be used\r\nproperly, it is usually safe to begin sowing. The customs which\r\nprevail generally with regard to the time of spring sowing may be\r\nadopted in dry-farm practices also.\r\n\r\nDepth of seeding\r\n\r\nThe depth to which seed should be planted in the soil is of\r\nimportance in a system of dry-farming. The reserve materials in\r\nseeds are used to produce the first roots and the young plants. No\r\nnew nutriment beyond that stored in the soil can be obtained by the\r\nplant until the leaves are above the ground able to gather Carleton\r\nfrom the atmosphere. The danger of deep planting lies, therefore, in\r\nexhausting the reserve materials of the seeds before the plant has\r\nbeen able to push its leaves above the ground. Should this occur,\r\nthe plant will probably die in the soil. On the other hand, if the\r\nseed is not planted deeply enough, it may happen that the roots\r\ncannot be sent down far enough to connect with the soil-water\r\nreservoir below. Then, the root system will not be strong and deep,\r\nbut will have to depend for its development upon the surface water,\r\nwhich is always a dangerous practice in dry-farming. The rule as to\r\nthe depth of seeding is simply: Plant as deeply as is safe. The\r\ndepth to which seeds may be safely placed depends upon the nature of\r\nthe soil, its fertility, its physical condition, and the water that\r\nit contains. In sandy soils, planting may be deeper than in clay\r\nsoils, for it requires less energy for a plant to push roots, stems,\r\nand leaves through the loose sandy soil than through the more\r\ncompact clay soil; in a dry soil planting may be deeper than in wet\r\nsoils; likewise, deep planting is safer in a loose soil than in one\r\nfirmly compacted; finally, where the moist soil is considerable\r\ndistance below the surface, deeper planting may be practiced than\r\nwhen the moist soil is near the surface. Countless experiments have\r\nbeen conducted on the subject of depth of seeding. In a few cases,\r\nordinary agricultural seeds planted eight inches deep have come up\r\nand produced satisfactory plants. However, the consensus of opinion\r\nis that from one to three inches are best in humid districts, but\r\nthat, everything considered, four inches is the best depth under\r\ndry-farm conditions. Under a low natural precipitation, where the\r\nmethods of dry-farming are practiced, it is always safe to plant\r\ndeeply, for such a practice will develop and strengthen the root\r\nsystem, which is one big step toward successful dry-farming.\r\n\r\nQuantity to sow\r\n\r\nNumerous dry-farm failures may be charged wholly to ignorance\r\nconcerning the quantity of seed to sow. In no other practice has the\r\ncustom of humid countries been followed more religiously by\r\ndry-farmers, and failure has nearly always resulted. The discussions\r\nin this volume have brought out the fact that every plant of\r\nwhatever character requires a large amount of water for its growth.\r\nFrom the first day of its growth to the day of its maturity, large\r\namounts of water are taken from the soil through the plant and\r\nevaporated into the air through the leaves. When the large\r\nquantities of seed employed in humid countries have been sown on dry\r\nlands, the result has usually been an excellent stand early in the\r\nseason, with a crop splendid in appearance up to early summer. .A\r\nluxuriant spring crop reduces, however, the water content of the\r\nsoil so greatly that when the heat of the summer arrives, there is\r\nnot sufficient water left in the soil to support the final\r\ndevelopment and ripening. A thick stand in early spring is no\r\nassurance to the dry-farmer of a good harvest. On the contrary, it\r\nis usually the field with a thin stand in spring that stands up best\r\nthrough the summer and yields most at the time of harvest. The\r\nquantity of seed sown should vary with the soil conditions: the more\r\nfertile the soil is, the more seed may be used; the more water in\r\nthe soil, the more seed may be sown; as the fertility or the water\r\ncontent diminishes, the amount of seed should likewise be\r\ndiminished. Under dry-farm conditions the fertility is good, but the\r\nmoisture is low. As a general principle, therefore, light seeding\r\nshould be practiced on dry-farms, though it should be sufficient to\r\nyield a crop that will shade the ground well. If the sowing is done\r\nearly, in fall or spring, less seed may be used than if the sowing\r\nis late, because the early sowing gives a better chance for root\r\ndevelopment, which results, ordinarily, in more vigorous plants that\r\nconsume more moisture than the smaller and weaker plants of later\r\nsowing. If the winters are mild and well covered with snow, less\r\nseed may be used than in districts where severe or open winters\r\ncause a certain amount of winter-killing. On a good seed-bed of\r\nfallowed soil less seed may be used than where the soil has not been\r\ncarefully tilled and is somewhat rough and lumpy and unfavorable for\r\ncomplete germination. The yield of any crop is not directly\r\nproportional to the amount sown, unless all factors contributing to\r\ngermination are alike. In the case of wheat and other grains, thin\r\nseeding also gives a plant a better chance for stooling, which is\r\nNature's method of adapting the plant to the prevailing moisture and\r\nfertility conditions. When plants are crowded, stooling cannot occur\r\nto any marked degree, and the crop is rendered helpless in attempts\r\nto adapt itself to surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nIn general the rule may be laid down that a little more than one\r\nhalf as much seed should be used in dry-farm districts with an\r\nannual rainfall of about fifteen inches than is used in humid\r\ndistricts. That is, as against the customary five pecks of wheat\r\nused per acre in humid countries about three pecks or even two pecks\r\nshould be used on dry-farms. Merrill recommends the seeding of oats\r\nat the rate of about three pecks per acre; of barley, about three\r\npecks; of rye, two pecks; of alfalfa, six pounds; of corn, two\r\nkernels to the hill, and other crops in the same proportion. No\r\ninvariable rule can be laid down for perfect germination. A small\r\nquantity of seed is usually sufficient; but where germination\r\nfrequently fails in part, more seed must be used. If the stand is\r\ntoo thick at the beginning of the growing season, it must be\r\nharrowed out. Naturally, the quantity of seed to be used should be\r\nbased on the number of kernels as well as on the weight. For\r\ninstance, since the larger the individual wheat kernels the fewer in\r\na bushel, fewer plants would be produced from a bushel of large than\r\nfrom a bushel of small seed wheat. The size of the seed in\r\ndetermining the amount for sowing is often important and should be\r\ndetermined by some simple method, such as counting the seeds\r\nrequired to fill a small bottle.\r\n\r\nMethod of sowing\r\n\r\nThere should really be no need of discussing the method of sowing\r\nwere it not that even at this day there are farmers in the dry-farm\r\ndistrict who sow by broadcasting and insist upon the superiority of\r\nthis method. The broadcasting of seed has no place in any system of\r\nscientific agriculture, least of all in dry-farming, where success\r\ndepends upon the degree with which all conditions are controlled. In\r\nall good dry-farm practice seed should be placed in rows, preferably\r\nby means of one of the numerous forms of drill seeders found upon\r\nthe market. The advantages of the drill are almost self-evident. It\r\npermits uniform distribution of the seed, which is indispensable for\r\nsuccess on soils that receive limited rainfall. The seed may be\r\nplaced at an even depth, which is very necessary, especially in fall\r\nsowing, where the seed depends for proper germination upon the\r\nmoisture already stored in the soil. The deep seeding often\r\nnecessary under dry-farm conditions makes the drill indispensable.\r\nMoreover, Hunt has explained that the drill furrows themselves have\r\ndefinite advantages. During the winter the furrows catch the snow,\r\nand because of the protection thus rendered, the seed is less likely\r\nto be heaved out by repeated freezing and thawing. The drill furrow\r\nalso protects to a certain extent against the drying action of winds\r\nand in that way, though the furrows are small, they aid materially\r\nin enabling the young plant to pass through the winter successfully.\r\nThe rains of fall and spring are accumulated in the furrows and made\r\neasily accessible to plants. Moreover, many of the drills have\r\nattachments whereby the soil is pressed around the seed and the\r\ntopsoil afterwards stirred to prevent evaporation. This permits of a\r\nmuch more rapid and complete germination. The drill, the advantages\r\nof which were taught two hundred years ago by Jethro Tull, is one of\r\nthe most valuable implements of modern agriculture. On dry-farms it\r\nis indispensable. The dry-farmer should make a careful study of the\r\ndrills on the market and choose such as comply with the principles\r\nof the successful prosecution of dry-farming. Drill culture is the\r\nonly method of sowing that can be permitted if uniform success is\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe care of the crop\r\n\r\nExcepting the special treatment for soil-moisture conservation,\r\ndry-farm crops should receive the treatment usually given crops\r\ngrowing under humid conditions. The light rains that frequently fall\r\nin autumn sometimes form a crust on the top of the soil, which\r\nhinders the proper germination and growth of the fall-sown crop. It\r\nmay be necessary, therefore, for the farmer to go over the land in\r\nthe fall with a disk or more preferably with a corrugated roller.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, however, after fall sowing there is no further need of\r\ntreatment until the following spring. The spring treatment is of\r\nconsiderably more importance, for when the warmth of spring and\r\nearly summer begins to make itself felt, a crust forms over many\r\nkinds of dry-farm soils. This is especially true where the soil is\r\nof the distinctively arid kind and poor in organic matter. Such a\r\ncrust should be broken early in order to give the young plants a\r\nchance to develop freely. This may be accomplished, as above stated,\r\nby the use of a disk, corrugated roller, or ordinary smoothing\r\nharrow.\r\n\r\nWhen the young grain is well under way, it may be found to be too\r\nthick. If so, the crop may be thinned by going over the field with a\r\ngood irontooth harrow with the teeth so set as to tear out a portion\r\nof the plants. This treatment may enable the remaining plants to\r\nmature with the limited amount of moisture in the soil.\r\nParadoxically, if the crop seems to be too thin in the spring,\r\nharrowing may also be of service. In such a case the teeth should be\r\nslanted backwards and the harrowing done simply for the purpose of\r\nstirring the soil without injury to the plant, to conserve the\r\nmoisture stored in the soil and to accelerate the formation of\r\nnitrates.--The conserved moisture and added fertility will\r\nstrengthen the growth and diminish the water requirements of the\r\nplants, and thus yield a larger crop. The iron-tooth harrow is a\r\nvery useful implement on the dry-farm when the crops are young.\r\nAfter the plants are up so high that the harrow cannot be used on\r\nthem no special care need be given them, unless indeed they are\r\ncultivated crops like corn or potatoes which, of course, as\r\nexplained in previous chapters, should receive continual\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nHarvesting\r\n\r\nThe methods of harvesting crops on dry-farms are practically those\r\nfor farms in humid districts. The one great exception may be the use\r\nof the header on the grain farms of the dry-farm sections. The\r\nheader has now become well-nigh general in its use. Instead of\r\ncutting and binding the grain, as in the old method, the heads are\r\nsimply cut off and piled in large stacks which later are threshed.\r\nThe high straw which remains is plowed under in the fall and helps\r\nto supply the soil with organic matter. The maintenance of dry-farms\r\nfor over a generation without the addition of manures has been made\r\npossible by the organic matter added to the soil in the decay of the\r\nhigh vigorous straw remaining after the header. In fact, the changes\r\noccurring in the soil in connection with the decaying of the header\r\nstubble appear to have actually increased the available fertility.\r\nHundreds of Utah dry wheat farms during the last ten or twelve years\r\nhave increased in fertility, or at least in productive power, due\r\nundoubtedly to the introduction of the header system of harvesting.\r\nThis system of harvesting also makes the practice of fallowing much\r\nmore effective, for it helps maintain the organic matter which is\r\ndrawn upon by the fallow seasons. The header should be used wherever\r\npracticable. The fear has been expressed that the high header straw\r\nplowed under will make the soil so loose as to render proper sowing\r\ndifficult and also, because of the easy circulation of air in the\r\nupper soil layers, cause a large loss of soil-moisture. This fear\r\nhas been found to be groundless, for wherever the header straw has\r\nbeen plowed under; especially in connection with fallowing, the soil\r\nhas been benefited.\r\n\r\nRapidity and economy in harvesting are vital factors in dry-farming,\r\nand new devices are constantly being offered to expedite the work.\r\nOf recent years the combined harvester and thresher has come into\r\ngeneral use. It is a large header combined with an ordinary\r\nthreshing machine. The grain is headed and threshed in one operation\r\nand the sacks dropped along the path of the machine. The straw is\r\nscattered over the field where it belongs.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the question of sowing, care of crop, and harvesting may\r\nbe answered by the methods that have been so well developed in\r\ncountries of abundant rainfall, except as new methods may be\r\nrequired to offset the deficiency in the rainfall which is the\r\ndetermining condition of dry-farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCROPS FOR DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of the dry-farmer is only half done when the soil has been\r\nproperly prepared, by deep plowing, cultivation, fallowing, for the\r\nplanting of the crop. The choice of the crop, its proper seeding,\r\nand its correct care and harvesting are as important as rational\r\nsoil treatment in the successful pursuit of dry-farming. It is true\r\nthat in general the kinds of crops ordinarily cultivated in humid\r\nregions are grown also on arid lands, but varieties especially\r\nadapted to the prevailing dry-farm conditions must be used if any\r\ncertainty of harvest is desired. Plants possess a marvelous power of\r\nadaptation to environment, and this power becomes stronger as\r\nsuccessive generations of plants are grown under the given\r\nconditions. Thus, plants which have been grown for long periods of\r\ntime in countries of abundant rainfall and characteristic humid\r\nclimate and soil yield well under such conditions, but usually\r\nsuffer and die or at best yield scantily if planted in hot rainless\r\ncountries with deep soils. Yet, such plants, if grown year after\r\nyear under arid conditions, become accustomed to warmth and dryness\r\nand in time will yield perhaps nearly as well or it may be better in\r\ntheir new surroundings. The dry-farmer who looks for large harvests\r\nmust use every care to secure varieties of crops that through\r\ngenerations of breeding have become adapted to the conditions\r\nprevailing on his farm. Home-grown seeds, if grown properly, are\r\ntherefore of the highest value. In fact, in the districts where\r\ndry-farming has been practiced longest the best yielding varieties\r\nare, with very few exceptions, those that have been grown for many\r\nsuccessive years on the same lands. The comparative newness of the\r\nattempts to produce profitable crops in the present dry-farming\r\nterritory and the consequent absence of home-grown seed has rendered\r\nit wise to explore other regions of the world, with similar climatic\r\nconditions, but long inhabited, for suitable crop varieties. The\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture has accomplished much good\r\nwork in this direction. The breeding of new varieties by scientific\r\nmethods is also important, though really valuable results cannot be\r\nexpected for many years to come. When results do come from breeding\r\nexperiments, they will probably be of the greatest value to the\r\ndry-farmer. Meanwhile, it must be acknowledged that at the present,\r\nour knowledge of dry-farm crops is extremely limited. Every year\r\nwill probably bring new additions to the list and great improvements\r\nof the crops and varieties now recommended. The progressive\r\ndry-farmer should therefore keep in close touch with state and\r\ngovernment workers concerning the best varieties to use.\r\n\r\nMoreover, while the various sections of the dry-farming territory\r\nare alike in receiving a small amount of rainfall, they are widely\r\ndifferent in other conditions affecting plant growth, such as soils,\r\nwinds, average temperature, and character and severity of the\r\nwinters. Until trials have been made in all these varying\r\nlocalities, it is not safe to make unqualified recommendations of\r\nany crop or crop variety. At the present we can only say that for\r\ndry-farm purposes we must have plants that will produce the maximum\r\nquantity of dry matter with the minimum quantity of water; and that\r\ntheir periods of growth must be the shortest possible. However,\r\nenough work has been done to establish some general rules for the\r\nguidance of the dry-farmer in the selection of crops. Undoubtedly,\r\nwe have as yet had only a glimpse of the vast crop possibilities of\r\nthe dry-farming territory in the United States, as well as in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWheat\r\n\r\nWheat is the leading dry-farm crop. Every prospect indicates that it\r\nwill retain its preĆ«minence. Not only is it the most generally\r\nused cereal, but the world is rapidly learning to depend more and\r\nmore upon the dry-farming areas of the world for wheat production.\r\nIn the arid and semiarid regions it is now a commonly accepted\r\ndoctrine that upon the expensive irrigated lands should be grown\r\nfruits, vegetables, sugar beets, and other intensive crops, while\r\nwheat, corn, and other grains and even much of the forage should be\r\ngrown as extensive crops upon the non-irrigated or dry-farm lands.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the time is near at hand when it will be a\r\nrarity to see grain grown upon irrigated soil, providing the\r\nclimatic conditions permit the raising of more extensive crops.\r\n\r\nIn view of the present and future greatness of the wheat crop on\r\nsemiarid lands, it is very important to secure the varieties that\r\nwill best meet the varying dry-farm conditions. Much has been done\r\nto this end, but more needs to be done. Our knowledge of the best\r\nwheats is still fragmentary. This is even more true of other\r\ndry-farm crops. According to Jardine, the dry-farm wheats grown at\r\npresent in the United States may be classificd as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Hard spring wheats:\r\n(a) Common\r\n(b) Durum\r\n\r\nII. Winter wheats:\r\n(a) Hard wheats (Crimean)\r\n(b) Semihard wheats (Intermountain)\r\n(c) Soft wheats (Pactfic)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common varieties of hard _spring wheats _are grown principally\r\nin districts where winter wheats have not as yet been successful;\r\nthat is, in the Dakotas, northwestern Nebraska, and other localities\r\nwith long winters and periods of alternate thawing and severe\r\nfreezing. The superior value of winter wheat has been so clearly\r\ndemonstrated that attempts are being made to develop in every\r\nlocality winter wheats that can endure the prevailing climatic\r\nconditions. Spring wheats are also grown in a scattering way and in\r\nsmall quantities over the whole dry-farm territory. The two most\r\nvaluable varieties of the common hard spring wheat are Blue Stem and\r\nRed Fife, both well-established varieties of excellent milling\r\nqualities, grown in immense quantities in the Northeastern corner of\r\nthe dry-farm territory of the United States and commanding the best\r\nprices on the markets of the world. It is notable that Red Fife\r\noriginated in Russia, the country which has given us so many good\r\ndry-farm crops.\r\n\r\nThe durum wheats or macaroni wheats, as they are often called, are\r\nalso spring wheats which promise to displace all other spring\r\nvarieties because of their excellent yields under extreme dry-farm\r\nconditions. These wheats, though known for more than a generation\r\nthrough occasional shipments from Russia, Algeria, and Chile, were\r\nintroduced to the farmers of the United States only in 1900, through\r\nthe explorations and enthusiastic advocacy of Carleton of the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture. Since that time they have been\r\ngrown in nearly all the dryfarm states and especially in the Great\r\nPlains area. Wherever tried they have yielded well, in some cases as\r\nmuch as the old established winter varieties. The extreme hardness\r\nof these wheats made it difficult to induce the millers operating\r\nmills fitted for grinding softer wheats to accept them for\r\nflourmaking purposes. This prejudice has, however, gradually\r\nvanished, and to-day the durum wheats are in great demand,\r\nespecially for blending with the softer wheats and for the making of\r\nmacaroni. Recently the popularity of the durum wheats among the\r\nfarmers has been enhanced, owing to the discovery that they are\r\nstrongly rust resistant.\r\n\r\nThe _winter wheats, _as has been repeatedly suggested in preceding\r\nchapters, are most desirable for dry-farm purposes, wherever they\r\ncan be grown, and especially in localities where a fair\r\nprecipitation occurs in the winter and spring. The hard winter\r\nwheats are represented mainly by the Crimean group, the chief\r\nmembers of which are Turkey, Kharkow, and Crimean. These wheats also\r\noriginated in Russia and are said to have been brought to the United\r\nStates a generation ago by Mennonite colonists. At present these\r\nwheats are grown chiefly in the central and southern parts of the\r\nGreat Plains area and in Canada, though they are rapidly spreading\r\nover the intermountain country. These are good milling wheats of\r\nhigh gluten content and yielding abundantly under dry-farm\r\nconditions. It is quite clear that these wheats will soon displace\r\nthe older winter wheats formerly grown on dry-farms. Turkey wheat\r\npromises to become the leading dry-farm wheat. The semisoft winter\r\nwheats are grown chiefly in the intermountain country. They are\r\nrepresented by a very large number of varieties, all tending toward\r\nsoftness and starchiness. This may in part be due to climatic, soil,\r\nand irrigation conditions, but is more likely a result of inherent\r\nqualities in the varieties used. They are rapidly being displaced by\r\nhard varieties.\r\n\r\nThe group of soft winter wheats includes numerous varieties grown\r\nextensively in the famous wheat districts of California, Oregon,\r\nWashington, and northern Idaho. The main varieties are Red Russian\r\nand Palouse Blue Stem, in Washington and Idaho, Red Chaff and Foise\r\nin Oregon, and Defiance, Little Club, Sonora, and White Australian\r\nin California. These are all soft, white, and rather poor in gluten.\r\nIt is believed that under given climatic, soil, and cultural\r\nconditions, all wheat varieties will approach one type, distinctive\r\nof the conditions in question, and that the California wheat type is\r\na result of prevailing unchangeable conditions. More researeh is\r\nneeded, however, before definite principles can be laid down\r\nconcerning the formation of distinctive wheat types in the various\r\ndry-farm sections. Under any condition, a change of seed, keeping\r\nimprovement always in view, should be baneficial.\r\n\r\nJardine has reminded the dry-farmers of the United States that\r\nbefore the production of wheat on the dry-farms can reach its full\r\npossibilities under any acreage, sufficient quantities must be grown\r\nof a few varieties to affect the large markets. This is especially\r\nimportant in the intermountain country where no uniformity exists,\r\nbut the warning should be heeded also by the Pacific coast and Great\r\nPlains wheat areas. As soon as the best varieties are found they\r\nshould displace the miscellaneous collection of wheat varieties now\r\ngrown. The individual farmer can be a law unto himself no more in\r\nwheat growing than in fruit growing, if he desires to reap the\r\nlargest reward of his efforts. Only by uniformity of kind and\r\nquality and large production will any one locality impress itself\r\nupon the markets and create a demand. The changes now in progress by\r\nthe dry-farmers of the United States indicate that this lesson has\r\nbeen taken to heart. The principle is equally important for all\r\ncountries where dry-farming is practiced.\r\n\r\nOther small grains\r\n\r\n_Oats _is undoubtedly a coming dry-farm crop. Several varieties have\r\nbeen found which yield well on lands that receive an average annual\r\nrainfall of less than fifteen inches. Others will no doubt be\r\ndiscovered or developed as special attention is given to dry-farm\r\noats. Oats occurs as spring and winter varieties, but only one\r\nwinter variety has as yet found place in the list of dry-farm crops.\r\nThe leading; spring varieties of oats are the Sixty-Day, Kherson,\r\nBurt, and Swedish Select. The one winter variety, which is grown\r\nchiefly in Utah, is the Boswell, a black variety originally brought\r\nfrom England about 1901.\r\n\r\n_Barley, _like the other common grains, occurs in varieties that\r\ngrow well on dry-farms. In comparison with wheat very little seareh\r\nhas been made for dry-farm barleys, and, naturally, the list of\r\ntested varieties is very small. Like wheat and oats, barley occurs\r\nin spring and winter varieties, but as in the case of oats only one\r\nwinter variety has as yet found its way into the approved list of\r\ndry-farm crops. The best dry-farm spring barleys are those belonging\r\nto the beardless and hull-less types, though the more common\r\nvarieties also yield well, especially the six-rowed beardless\r\nbarley. The winter variety is the Tennessee Winter, which is already\r\nwell distributed over the Great Plains district.\r\n\r\n_Rye _is one of the surest dry-farm crops. It yields good crops of\r\nstraw and grain, both of which are valuable stock foods. In fact,\r\nthe great power of rye to survive and grow luxuriantly under the\r\nmost trying dry-farm conditions is the chief objection to it. Once\r\nstarted, it is hard to eradicate. Properly cultivated and used\r\neither as a stock feed or as green manure, it is very valuable. Rye\r\noccurs as both spring and winter varieties. The winter varieties are\r\nusually most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nCarleton has recommended _emmer _as a crop peculiarly adapted to\r\nsemiarid conditions. Emmer is a species of wheat to the berries of\r\nwhich the chaff adheres very closely. It is highly prized as a stock\r\nfeed. In Russia and Germany it is grown in very large quantities. It\r\nis especially adapted to arid and semiarid conditions, but will\r\nprobably thrive best where the winters are dry and summers wet. It\r\nexists as spring and winter varieties. is with the other small\r\ngrains, the success of emmer will depend largely upon the\r\nsatisfactory development of winter varieties.\r\n\r\nCorn\r\n\r\nOf all crops yet tried on dry-farms, corn is perhaps the most\r\nuniformly successful under extreme dry conditions. If the soil\r\ntreatment and planting have been right, the failures that have been\r\nreported may invariably be traced to the use of seed which had not\r\nbeen acclimated. The American Indians grow corn which is excellent\r\nfor dry-farm purposes; many of the western farmers have likewise\r\nproduced strains that use the minimum of moisture, and, moreover,\r\ncorn brought from humid sections adapts itself to arid conditions in\r\na very few years. Escobar reports a native corn grown in Mexico with\r\nlow stalks and small ears that well endures desert conditions. In\r\nextremely dry years corn does not always produce a profitable crop\r\nof seed, but the crop as a whole, for forage purposes, seldom fails\r\nto pay expenses and leave a margin for profit. In wetter years there\r\nis a corresponding increase of the corn crop. The dryfarming\r\nterritory does not yet realize the value of corn as a dry-farm crop.\r\nThe known facts concerning corn make it safe to predict, however,\r\nthat its dry farm acreage will increase rapidly, and that in time it\r\nwill crowd the wheat crop for preĆ«minence.\r\n\r\nSorghums\r\n\r\nAmong dry-farm crops not popularly known are the sorghums, which\r\npromise to become excellent yielders under arid conditions. The\r\nsorghums are supposed to have come grown the tropical sections of\r\nthe globe, but they are now scattered over the earth in all climes.\r\nThe sorghums have been known in the United States for over half a\r\ncentury, but it was only when dry-farming began to develop so\r\ntremendously that the drouth-resisting power of the sorghums was\r\nrecalled. According to Ball, the sorghums fall into the following\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SORGHUMS\r\n\r\n1. Broom corns\r\n2. Sorgas or sweet sorghums\r\n3. Kafirs\r\n4. Durras\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broom corns are grown only for their brush, and are not\r\nconsidered in dry-farming; the sorgas for forage and sirups, and are\r\nespecially adapted for irrigation or humid conditions, though they\r\nare said to endure dry-farm conditions better than corn. The Kafirs\r\nare dry-farm crops and are grown for grain and forage. This group\r\nincludes Red Kafir, White Kafir, Black-hulled White Kafir, and White\r\nMilo, all of which are valuable for dry-farming. The Durras are\r\ngrown almost exclusively for seed and include Jerusalem corn, Brown\r\nDurra, and Milo. The work of Ball has made Milo one of the most\r\nimportant dry-farm crops. As improved, the crop is from four to four\r\nand a half feet high, with mostly erect heads, carrying a large\r\nquantity of seeds. Milo is already a staple crop in parts of Texas,\r\nOklahoma, Kansas, and New Mexico. It has further been shown to be\r\nadapted to conditions in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona,\r\nUtah, and Idaho. It will probably be found, in some varietal form,\r\nvaluable over the whole dry-farm territory where the altitude is not\r\ntoo high and the average temperature not too low.\r\n\r\nIt has yielded an average of forty bushels of seed to the acre.\r\n\r\nLucern or alfalfa\r\n\r\nNext to human intelligence and industry, alfalfa has probably been\r\nthe chief factor in the development of the irrigated West. It has\r\nmade possible a rational system of agriculture, with the live-stock\r\nindustry and the maintenance of soil fertility as the central\r\nconsiderations. Alfalfa is now being recognized as a desirable crop\r\nin humid as well as in irrigated sections, and it is probable that\r\nalfalfa will soon become the chief hay crop of the United States.\r\nOriginally, lucern came from the hot dry countries of Asia, where it\r\nsupplied feed to the animals of the first historical peoples.\r\nMoreover, its long; tap roots, penetrating sometimes forty or fifty\r\nfeet into the ground, suggest that lucern may make ready use of\r\ndeeply stored soil-moisture. On these considerations, alone, lucern\r\nshould prove itself a crop well suited for dry-farming. In fact, it\r\nhas been demonstrated that where conditions are favorable, lucern\r\nmay be made to yield profitable crops under a rainfall between\r\ntwelve and fifteen inches. Alfalfa prefers calcareous loamy soils;\r\nsandy and heavy clay soils are not so well adapted for successful\r\nalfalfa production. Under dry-farm conditions the utmost care must\r\nbe used to prevent too thick seeding. The vast majority of alfalfa\r\nfailures on dry-farms have resulted from an insufficient supply of\r\nmoisture for the thickly planted crop. The alfalfa field does not\r\nattain its maturity until after the second year, and a crop which\r\nlooks just right the second year will probably be much too thick the\r\nthird and fourth years. From four to six pounds of seed per acre are\r\nusually ample. Another main cause of failure is the common idea that\r\nthe lucern field needs little or no cultivation, when, in fact, the\r\nalfalfa field should receive as careful soil treatment as the wheat\r\nfield. Heavy, thorough disking in spring or fall, or both, is\r\nadvisable, for it leaves the topsoil in a condition to prevent\r\nevaporation and admit air. In Asiatic and North African countries,\r\nlucern is frequently cultivated between rows throughout the hot\r\nseason. This has been tried by Brand in this country and with very\r\ngood results. Since the crop should always be sown with a drill, it\r\nis comparatively easy to regulate the distance between the rows so\r\nthat cultivating implements may be used. If thin seeding and\r\nthorough soil stirring are practiced, lucern usually grows well, and\r\nwith such treatment should become one of the great dry-farm crops.\r\nThe yield of hay is not large, but sufficient to leave a comfortable\r\nmargin of profit. Many farmers find it more profitable to grow\r\ndry-farm lucern for seed. In good years from fifty to one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars may be taken from an acre of lucern seed. However,\r\nat the present, the principles of lucern seed production are not\r\nwell established, and the seed crop is uncertain.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is a leguminous crop and gathers nitrogen from the air. It\r\nis therefore a good fertilizer. The question of soil fertility will\r\nbecome more important with the passing of the years, and the value\r\nof lucern as a land improver will then be more evident than it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nOther leguminous crops\r\n\r\nThe group of leguminous or pod-bearing crops is of great importance;\r\nfirst, because it is rich in nitrogenous substances which are\r\nvaluable animal foods, and, secondly, because it has the power of\r\ngathering nitrogen from the air, which can be used for maintaining\r\nthe fertility of the soil. Dry-farming will not be a wholly safe\r\npractice of agriculture until suitable leguminous crops are found\r\nand made part of the crop system. It is notable that over the whole\r\nof the dry-farm territory of this and other countries wild\r\nleguminous plants flourish. That is, nitrogen-gathering plants are\r\nat work on the deserts. The farmer upsets this natural order of\r\nthings by cropping the land with wheat and wheat only, so long as\r\nthe land will produce profitably. The leguminous plants native to\r\ndry-farm areas have not as yet been subjected to extensive economic\r\nstudy, and in truth very little is known concerning leguminous\r\nplants adapted to dry-farming.\r\n\r\nIn California, Colorado, and other dry-farm states the field pea has\r\nbeen grown with great profit. Indeed it has been found much more\r\nprofitable than wheat production. The field bean, likewise, has been\r\ngrown successfully under dry-farm conditions, under a great variety\r\nof climates. In Mexico and other southern climates, the native\r\npopulation produce large quantities of beans upon their dry lands.\r\n\r\nShaw suggests that sanfoin, long famous for its service to European\r\nagriculture, may be found to be a profitable dry-farm crop, and that\r\nsand vetch promises to become an excellent dry-farm crop. It is very\r\nlikely, however, that many of the leguminous crops which have been\r\ndeveloped under conditions of abundant rainfall will be valueless on\r\ndry-farm lands. Every year will furnish new and more complete\r\ninformation on this subject. Leguminous plants will surely become\r\nimportant members of the association of dry-farm crops.\r\n\r\nTrees and shrubs\r\n\r\nSo far, trees cannot be said to be dry-farm crops, though facts are\r\non record that indicate that by the application of correct dry-farm\r\nprinciples trees may be made to grow and yield profitably on\r\ndry-farm lands. Of course, it is a well-known fact that native trees\r\nof various kinds are occasionally found growing on the deserts,\r\nwhere the rainfall is very light and the soil has been given no\r\ncare. Examples of such vegetation are the native cedars found\r\nthroughout the Great Basin region and the mesquite tree in Arizona\r\nand the Southwest. Few farmers in the arid region have as yet\r\nundertaken tree culture without the aid of irrigation.\r\n\r\nAt least one peach orchard is known in Utah which grows under a\r\nrainfall of about fifteen inches without irrigation and produces\r\nregularly a small crop of most delicious fruit. Parsons describes\r\nhis Colorado dry-farm orchard in which, under a rainfall of almost\r\nfourteen inches, he grows, with great profit, cherries, plums, and\r\napples. A number of prospering young orchards are growing without\r\nirrigation in the Great Plains area. Mason discovered a few years\r\nago two olive orchards in Arizona and the Colorado desert which,\r\nplanted about fourteen years previously, were thriving under an\r\nannual rainfall of eight and a half and four and a half inches,\r\nrespectively. These olive orchards had been set out under canals\r\nwhich later failed. Such attested facts lead to the thought that\r\ntrees may yet take their place as dry-farm crops. This hope is\r\nstrengthened when it is recalled that the great nations of\r\nantiquity, living in countries of low rainfall, grew profitably and\r\nwithout irrigation many valuable trees, some of which are still\r\ncultivated in those countries. The olive industry, for example, is\r\neven now being successfully developed by modern methods in Asiatic\r\nand African sections, where the average annual rainfall is under ten\r\ninches. Since 1881, under French management, the dry-farm olive\r\ntrees around Tunis have increased from 45,000 to 400,000\r\nindividuals. Mason and also Aaronsohn suggest as trees that do well\r\nin the arid parts of the old world the so-called \"Chinese date\" or\r\nJuJube tree, the sycamore fig, and the Carob tree, which yields the\r\n\"St. John's Bread\" so dear to childhood.\r\n\r\nOf this last tree, Aaronsolm says that twenty trees to the acre,\r\nunder a rainfall of twelve inches, will produce 8000 pounds of fruit\r\ncontaining 40 per cent of sugar and 7 to 8 per cent of protein. This\r\nsurpasses the best harvest of alfalfa. Kearnley, who has made a\r\nspecial study of dry-land olive culture in northern Africa, states\r\nthat in his belief a large variety of fruit trees may be found which\r\nwill do well under arid and semiarid conditions, and may even yield\r\nmore profit than the grains.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that many shade and ornamental and other useful\r\nplants can be grown on dry-farms; as, for instance, locust, elm,\r\nblack walnut, silverpoplar, catalpa, live oak, black oak, yellow\r\npine, red spruce, Douglas fir, and cedar.\r\n\r\nThe secret of success in tree growing on dry-farms seems to lie,\r\nfirst, in planting a few trees per acre,--the distance apart should\r\nbe twice the ordinary distance,--and, secondly, in applying\r\nvigorously and unceasingly the established principles of soil\r\ncultivation. In a soil stored deeply with moisture and properly\r\ncultivated, most plants will grow. If the soil has not been\r\ncarefully fallowed before planting, it may be necessary to water the\r\nyoung trees slightly during the first two seasons.\r\n\r\nSmall fruits have been tried on many farms with great success.\r\nPlums, currants, and gooseberries have all been successful. Grapes\r\ngrow and yield well in many dry-farm districts, especially along the\r\nwarm foothills of the Great Basin. Tree growing on dry-farm lands is\r\nnot yet well established and, therefore, should be undertaken with\r\ngreat care. Varieties accustomed to the climatic environment should\r\nbe chosen, and the principles outlined in the preceding pages should\r\nbe carefully used.\r\n\r\nPotatoes\r\n\r\nIn recent years, potatoes have become one of the best dry-farm\r\ncrops. Almost wherever tried on lands under a rainfall of twelve\r\ninches or more potatoes have given comparatively large yields.\r\nTo-day, the growing of dry-farm potatoes is becoming an important\r\nindustry. The principles of light seeding and thorough cultivation\r\nare indispensable for success. Potatoes are well adapted for use in\r\nrotations, where summer fallowing is not thought desirable.\r\nMacdonald enumerates the following as the best varieties at present\r\nused on dry-farms: Ohio, Mammoth, Pearl, Rural New Yorker, and\r\nBurbank.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n\r\nA further list of dry-farm crops would include representatives of\r\nnearly all economic plants, most of them tried in small quantity in\r\nvarious localities. Sugar beets, vegetables, bulbous plants, etc.,\r\nhave all been grown without irrigation under dry-farm conditions.\r\nSome of these will no doubt be found to be profitable and will then\r\nbe brought into the commercial scheme of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the crop problems of dry-farming demand that much careful\r\nwork be done in the immediate future by the agencies having such\r\nwork in charge. The best varieties of crops already in profitable\r\nuse need to be determined. More new plants from all parts of the\r\nworld need to be brought to this new dry-farm territory and tried\r\nout. Many of the native plants need examination with a view to their\r\neconomic use. For instance, the sego lily bulbs, upon which the Utah\r\npioneers subsisted for several seasons of famine, may possibly be\r\nmade a cultivated crop. Finally, it remains to be said that it is\r\ndoubtful wisdom to attempt to grow the more intensive crops on\r\ndry-farms. Irrigation and dry-farming will always go together. They\r\nare supplementary systems of agriculture in arid and semiarid\r\nregions. On the irrigated lands should be grown the crops that\r\nrequire much labor per acre and that in return yield largely per\r\nacre. New crops and varieties should besought for the irrigated\r\nfarms. On the dry-farms should be grown the crops that can be\r\nhandled in a large way and at a small cost per acre, and that yield\r\nonly moderate acre returns. By such cooperation between irrigation\r\nand dry-farming will the regions of the world with a scanty rainfall\r\nbecome the healthiest, wealthiest, happiest, and most populous on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF DRY-FARM CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acre-yields of crops on dry-farms, even under the most favorable\r\nmethods of culture, are likely to be much smaller than in humid\r\nsections with fertile soils. The necessity for frequent fallowing or\r\nresting periods over a large portion of the dry-farm territory\r\nfurther decreases the average annual yield. It does not follow from\r\nthis condition that dry-farming is less profitable than humid-or\r\nirrigation-farming, for it has been fully demonstrated that the\r\nprofit on the investment is as high under proper dry-farming as\r\nunder any other similar generally adopted system of farming in any\r\npart of the world. Yet the practice of dry-farming would appear to\r\nbe, and indeed would be, much more desirable could the crop yield be\r\nincreased. The discovery of any condition which will offset the\r\nsmall annual yields is, therefore, of the highest importance to the\r\nadvancement of dry-farming. The recognition of the superior quality\r\nof practically all crops grown without irrigation under a limited\r\nrainfall has done much to stimulate faith in the great\r\nprofitableness of dry-farming. As the varying nature of the\r\nmaterials used by man for food, clothing, and shelter has become\r\nmore clearly understood, more attention has been given to the\r\nvaluation of commercial products on the basis of quality as well as\r\nof quantity. Sugar beets, for instance, are bought by the sugar\r\nfactories under a guarantee of a minimum sugar content; and many\r\nfactories of Europe vary the price paid according to the sugar\r\ncontained by the beets. The millers, especially in certain parts of\r\nthe country where wheat has deteriorated, distinguish carefully\r\nbetween the flour-producing qualities of wheats from various\r\nsections and fix the price accordingly. Even in the household,\r\ninformation concerning the real nutritive value of various foods is\r\nbeing sought eagerly, and foods let down to possess the highest\r\nvalue in the maintenance of life are displacing, even at a higher\r\ncost, the inferior products. The quality valuation is, in fact,\r\nbeing extended as rapidly as the growth of knowledge will permit to\r\nthe chief food materials of commerce. As this practice becomes fixed\r\nthe dry-farmer will be able to command the best market prices for\r\nhis products, for it is undoubtedly true that from the point of view\r\nof quality, dry-farm food products may be placed safely in\r\ncompetition with any farm products on the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nProportion of plant parts\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said, after the discussions in the preceding\r\nchapters, that the nature of plant growth is deeply modified by the\r\narid conditions prevailing in dry-farming. This shows itself first\r\nin the proportion of the various plant parts, such as roots, stems,\r\nleaves, and seeds. The root systems of dry-farm crops are generally\r\ngreatly developed, and it is a common observation that in adverse\r\nseasons the plants that possess the largest and most vigorous roots\r\nendure best the drouth and burning heat. The first function of the\r\nleaves is to gather materials for the building and strengthening of\r\nthe roots, and only after this has been done do the stems lengthen\r\nand the leaves thicken. Usually, the short season is largely gone\r\nbefore the stem and leaf growth begins, and, consequently, a\r\nsomewhat dwarfed appearance is characteristic of dry-farm crops. The\r\nsize of sugar beets, potato tubers, and such underground parts\r\ndepends upon the available water and food supply when the plant has\r\nestablished a satisfactory root and leaf system. If the water and\r\nfood are scarce, a thin beet results; if abundant, a well-filled\r\nbeet may result.\r\n\r\nDry-farming is characterized by a somewhat short season. Even if\r\ngood growing weather prevails, the decrease of water in the soil has\r\nthe effect of hastening maturity. The formation of flowers and seed\r\nbegins, therefore, earlier and is completed more quickly under arid\r\nthan under humid conditions. Moreover, and resulting probably from\r\nthe greater abundance of materials stored in the root system, the\r\nproportion of heads to leaves and stems is highest in dry-farm\r\ncrops. In fact, it is a general law that the proportion of heads to\r\nstraw in grain crops increases as the water supply decreases. This\r\nis shown very well even under humid or irrigation conditions when\r\ndifferent seasons or different applications of irrigation water are\r\ncompared. For instance, Hall quotes from the Rothamsted experiments\r\nto the effect that in 1879, which was a wet year (41 inches), the\r\nwheat crop yielded 38 pounds of grain for every 100 pounds of straw;\r\nwhereas, in 1893, which was a dry year (23 inches), the wheat crop\r\nyielded 95 pounds of grain to every 100 pounds of straw. The Utah\r\nstation likewise has established the same law under arid conditions.\r\nIn one series of experiments it was shown as an average of three\r\nyears' trial that a field which had received 22.5 inches of\r\nirrigation water produced a wheat crop that gave 67 pounds of grain\r\nto every 100 pounds of straw; while another field which received\r\nonly 7.5 inches of irrigation water produced a crop that gave 100\r\npounds of grain for every 100 pounds of straw. Since wheat is grown\r\nessentially for the grain, such a variation is of tremendous\r\nimportance. The amount of available water affects every part of the\r\nplant. Thus, as an illustration, Carleton states that the per cent\r\nof meat in oats grown in Wisconsin under humid conditions was 67.24,\r\nwhile in North Dakota, Kansas, and Montana, under arid and semiarid\r\nconditions, it was 71.51. Similar variations of plant parts may be\r\nobserved as a direct result of varying the amount of available\r\nwater. In general then, it may be said that the roots of dry-farm\r\ncrops are well developed; the parts above ground somewhat dwarfed;\r\nthe proportion of seed to straw high, and the proportion of meat or\r\nnutritive materials in the plant parts likewise high.\r\n\r\nThe water in dry-farm crops\r\n\r\nOne of the constant constituents of all plants and plant parts is\r\nwater. Hay, flour, and starch contain comparatively large quantities\r\nof water, which can be removed only by heat. The water in green\r\nplants is often very large. In young lucern, for instance, it\r\nreaches 85 per cent, and in young peas nearly 90 per cent, or more\r\nthan is found in good cow's milk. The water so held by plants has no\r\nnutritive value above ordinary water. It is, therefore, profitable\r\nfor the consumer to buy dry foods. In this particular, again,\r\ndry-farm crops have a distinct advantage: During growth there is not\r\nperhaps a great difference in the water content of plants, due to\r\nclimatic differences, but after harvest the drying-out process goes\r\non much more completely in dry-farm than in humid districts. Hay,\r\ncured in humid regions, often contains from 12 to 20 per cent of\r\nwater; in arid climates it contains as little as 5 per cent and\r\nseldom more than 12 per cent. The drier hay is naturally more\r\nvaluable pound for pound than the moister hay, and a difference in\r\nprice, based upon the difference in water content, is already being\r\nfelt in certain sections of the West.\r\n\r\nThe moisture content of dry-farm wheat, the chief dry-farm crop, is\r\neven more important. According to Wiley the average water content of\r\nwheat for the United States is 10.62 per cent, ranging from 15 to 7\r\nper cent. Stewart and Greaves examined a large number of wheats\r\ngrown on the dry-farms of Utah and found that the average per cent\r\nof water in the common bread varieties was 8.46 and in the durum\r\nvarieties 8.89. This means that the Utah dry-farm wheats transported\r\nto ordinary humid conditions would take up enough water from the air\r\nto increase their weight one fortieth, or 2.2 per cent, before they\r\nreached the average water content of American wheats. In other\r\nwords, 1,000,000 bushels of Utah dry-farm wheat contain as much\r\nnutritive matter as 1,025,000 bushels of wheat grown and kept under\r\nhumid conditions. This difference should be and now is recognized in\r\nthe prices paid. In fact, shrewd dealers, acquainted with the\r\ndryness of dry-farm wheat, have for some years bought wheat from the\r\ndry-farms at a slightly increased price, and trusted to the increase\r\nin weight due to water absorption in more humid climates for their\r\nprofits. The time should be near at hand when grains and similar\r\nproducts should be purchased upon the basis of a moisture test.\r\n\r\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that dry-farm crops are naturally drier\r\nthan those of humid countries, yet it must also be kept in mind that\r\nthe driest dry-farm crops are always obtained where the summers are\r\nhot and rainless. In sections where the precipitation comes chiefly\r\nin the spring and summer the difference would not be so great.\r\nTherefore, the crops raised on the Great Plains would not be so dry\r\nas those raised in California or in the Great Basin. Yet, wherever\r\nthe annual rainfall is so small as to establish dry-farm conditions,\r\nwhether it comes in the winter or summer, the cured crops are drier\r\nthan those produced under conditions of a much higher rainfall, and\r\ndry farmers should insist that, so far as possible in the future,\r\nsales be based on dry matter.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive substances in crops\r\n\r\nThe dry matter of all plants and plant parts consists of three very\r\ndistinct classes of substances: First, ash or the mineral\r\nconstituents. Ash is used by the body in building bones and in\r\nsupplying the blood with compounds essential to the various life\r\nprocesses. Second, protein or the substances containing the element\r\nnitrogen. Protein is used by the body in making blood, muscle,\r\ntendons, hair, and nails, and under certain conditions it is burned\r\nwithin the body for the production of heat. Protein is perhaps the\r\nmost important food constituent. Third, non-nitrogenous substances,\r\nincluding fats, woody fiber, and nitrogen-free extract, a name given\r\nto the group of sugars, starehes, and related substances. These\r\nsubstances are used by the body in the production of fat, and are\r\nalso burned for the production of heat. Of these valuable food\r\nconstituents protein is probably the most important, first, because\r\nit forms the most important tissues of the body and, secondly,\r\nbecause it is less abundant than the fats, starches, and sugars.\r\nIndeed, plants rich in protein nearly always command the highest\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThe composition of any class of plants varies considerably in\r\ndifferent localities and in different seasons. This may be due to\r\nthe nature of the soil, or to the fertilizer applied, though\r\nvariations in plant composition resulting from soil conditions are\r\ncomparatively small. The greater variations are almost wholly the\r\nresult of varying climate and water supply. As far as it is now\r\nknown the strongest single factor in changing the composition of\r\nplants is the amount of water available to the growing plant.\r\n\r\nVariations due to varying water supply\r\n\r\nThe Utah station has conducted numerous experiments upon the effect\r\nof water upon plant composition. The method in every case has been\r\nto apply different amounts of water throughout the growing season on\r\ncontiguous plats of uniform land. [Lengthy table deleated from this\r\nedition.] Even a casual study of . . . [the results show] that the\r\nquantity of water used influenced the composition of the plant\r\nparts. The ash and the fiber do not appear to be greatly influenced,\r\nbut the other constituents vary with considerable regularity with\r\nthe variations in the amount of irrigation water. The protein shows\r\nthe greatest variation. As the irrigation water is increased, the\r\npercentage of protein decreases. In the case of wheat the variation\r\nwas over 9 per cent. The percentage of fat and nitrogen-free\r\nextract, on the other hand, becomes larger as the water increases.\r\nThat is, crops grown with little water, as in dry-farming, are rich\r\nin the important flesh-and blood-forming substance protein, and\r\ncomparatively poor in fat, sugar, stareh, and other of the more\r\nabundant heat and fat-producing substances. This difference is of\r\ntremendous importance in placing dry-farming products on the food\r\nmarkets of the world. Not only seeds, tubers, and roots show this\r\nvariation, but the stems and leaves of plants grown with little\r\nwater are found to contain a higher percentage of protein than those\r\ngrown in more humid climates.\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of water upon the composition of plants has been\r\nobserved by many students. For instance, Mayer, working in Holland,\r\nfound that, in a soil containing throughout the season 10 per cent\r\nof water, oats was produced containing 10.6 per cent of protein; in\r\nsoil containing 30 per cent of water, the protein percentage was\r\nonly 5.6 per cent, and in soil containing 70 per cent of water, it\r\nwas only 5.2 per cent. Carleton, in a study of analyses of the same\r\nvarieties of wheat grown in humid and semi-arid districts of the\r\nUnited States, found that the percentage of protein in wheat from\r\nthe semiarid area was 14.4 per cent as against 11.94 per cent in the\r\nwheat from the humid area. The average protein content of the wheat\r\nof the United States is a little more than 12 per cent; Stewart and\r\nGreaves found an average of 16.76 per cent of protein in Utah\r\ndry-farm wheats of the common bread varieties and 17.14 per cent in\r\nthe durum varieties. The experiments conducted at Rothamsted,\r\nEngland, as given by Hall, confirm these results. For example,\r\nduring 1893, a very dry year, barley kernels contained 12.99 per\r\ncent of protein, while in 1894, a wet, though free-growing year, the\r\nbarley contained only 9.81 per cent of protein. Quotations might be\r\nmultiplied confirming the principle that crops grown with little\r\nwater contain much protein and little heat-and fat-producing\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nClimate and composition\r\n\r\nThe general climate, especially as regards the length of the growing\r\nseason and naturally including the water supply, has a strong effect\r\nupon the composition of plants. Carleton observed that the same\r\nvarieties of wheat grown at Nephi, Utah, contained 16.61 per cent\r\nprotein; at Amarillo, Texas, 15.25 per cent; and at McPherson,\r\nKansas, a humid station, 13.04 per cent. This variation is\r\nundoubtedly due in part to the varying annual precipitation but,\r\nalso, and in large part, to the varying general climatic conditions\r\nat the three stations.\r\n\r\nAn extremely interesting and important experiment, showing the\r\neffect of locality upon the composition of wheat kernels, is\r\nreported by LeClerc and Leavitt. Wheat grown in 1905 in Kansas was\r\nplanted in 1906 in Kansas, California, and Texas In 1907 samples of\r\nthe seeds grown at these three points were planted side by side at\r\neach of the three states All the crops from the three localities\r\nwere analyzed separately each year.\r\n\r\nThe results are striking and convincing. The original seed grown in\r\nKansas in 1905 contained 16.22 per cent of protein. The 1906 crop\r\ngrown from this seed in Kansas contained 19.13 per cent protein; in\r\nCalifornia, 10.38 percent; and in Texas, 12.18 percent. In 1907 the\r\ncrop harvested in Kansas from the 1906 seed from these widely\r\nseparated places and of very different composition contained\r\nuniformly somewhat more than 22 per cent of protein; harvested in\r\nCalifornia, somewhat more than 11 per cent; and harvested in Texas,\r\nabout 18 per cent. In short, the composition of wheat kernels is\r\nindependent of the composition of the seed or the nature of the\r\nsoil, but depends primarily upon the prevailing climatic conditions,\r\nincluding the water supply. The weight of the wheat per bushel, that\r\nis, the average size and weight of the wheat kernel, and also the\r\nhardness or flinty character of the kernels, were strongly affected\r\nby the varying climatic conditions. It is generally true that\r\ndry-farm grain weighs more per bushel than grain grown under humid\r\nconditions; hardness usually accompanies a high protein content and\r\nis therefore characteristic of dry-farm wheat. These notable lessons\r\nteach the futility of bringing in new seed from far distant places\r\nin the hope that better and larger crops may be secured. The\r\nconditions under which growth occurs determine chiefly the nature of\r\nthe crop. It is a common experience in the West that farmers who do\r\nnot understand this principle send to the Middle West for seed corn,\r\nwith the result that great crops of stalks and leaves with no ears\r\nare obtained. The only safe rule for the dry-farmer to follow is to\r\nuse seed which has been grown for many years under dry-farm\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nA reason for variation in composition\r\n\r\nIt is possible to suggest a reason for the high protein content of\r\ndry-farm crops. It is well known that all plants secure most of\r\ntheir nitrogen early in the growing period. From the nitrogen,\r\nprotein is formed, and all young plants are, therefore, very rich in\r\nprotein. As the plant becomes older, little more protein is added,\r\nbut more and more carbon is taken from the air to form the fats,\r\nstarches, sugars, and other non-nitrogenous substances.\r\nConsequently, the proportion or percentage of protein becomes\r\nsmaller as the plant becomes older. The impelling purpose of the\r\nplant is to produce seed. Whenever the water supply begins to give\r\nout, or the season shortens in any other way, the plant immediately\r\nbegins to ripen. Now, the essential effect of dry-farm conditions is\r\nto shorten the season; the comparatively young plants, yet rich in\r\nprotein, begin to produce seed; and at harvest, seed, and leaves,\r\nand stalks are rich in the flesh-and blood-forming element of\r\nplants. In more humid countries plants delay the time of seed\r\nproduction and thus enable the plants to store up more carbon and\r\nthus reduce the percent of protein. The short growing season,\r\ninduced by the shortness of water, is undoubtedly the main reason\r\nfor the higher protein content and consequently higher nutritive\r\nvalue of all dry-farm crops.\r\n\r\nNutritive value of dry-farm hay, straw, and flour\r\n\r\nAll the parts of dry-farm crops are highly nutritious. This needs to\r\nbe more clearly understood by the dry-farmers. Dry-farm hay, for\r\ninstance, because of its high protein content, may be fed with crops\r\nnot so rich in this element, thereby making a larger profit for the\r\nfarmer. Dry-farm straw often has the feeding value of good hay, as\r\nhas been demonstrated by analyses and by feeding tests conducted in\r\ntimes of hay scarcity. Especially is the header straw of high\r\nfeeding value, for it represents the upper and more nutritious ends\r\nof the stalks. Dry-farm straw, therefore, should be carefully kept\r\nand fed to animals instead of being scattered over the ground or\r\neven burned as is too often the case. Only few feeding experiments\r\nhaving in view the relative feeding value of dry-farm crops have as\r\nyet been made, but the few on record agree in showing the superior\r\nvalue of dry-farm crops, whether fed singly or in combination.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the chemical composition of plants and plant\r\nproducts induced by differences in the water-supply and climatic\r\nenvironment appear in the manufactured products, such as flour,\r\nbran, and shorts. Flour made from Fife wheat grown on the dry-farms\r\nof Utah contained practically 16 per cent of protein, while flour\r\nmade from Fife wheat grown in Lorraine and the Middle West is\r\nreported by the Maine Station as containing from 13.03 to 13.75 per\r\ncent of protein. Flour made from Blue Stem wheat grown on the Utah\r\ndry-farms contained 15.52 per cent of protein; from the same variety\r\ngrown in Maine and in the Middle West 11.69 and 11.51 per cent of\r\nprotein respectively. The moist and dry gluten, the gliadin and the\r\nglutenin, all of which make possible the best and most nourishing\r\nkinds of bread, are present in largest quantity and best proportion\r\nin flours made from wheats grown under typical dry-farm conditions.\r\nThe by-products of the milling process, likewise, are rich in\r\nnutritive elements.\r\n\r\nFuture Needs\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that there is a growing tendency to\r\npurchase food materials on the basis of composition. New discoveries\r\nin the domains of plant composition and animal nutrition and the\r\nimproved methods of rapid and accurate valuation will accelerate\r\nthis tendency. Even now, manufacturers of food products print on\r\ncartons and in advertising matter quality reasons for the superior\r\nfood values of certain articles. At least one firm produces two\r\nparallel sets of its manufactured foods, one for the man who does\r\nhard physical labor, and the other for the brain worker. Quality, as\r\nrelated to the needs of the body, whether of beast or man, is\r\nrapidly becoming the first question in judging any food material.\r\nThe present era of high prices makes this matter even more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIn view of this condition and tendency, the fact that dry-farm\r\nproducts are unusually rich in the most valuable nutritive materials\r\nis of tremendous importance to the development of dry-farming. The\r\nsmall average yields of dry-farm crops do not look so small when it\r\nis known that they command higher prices per pound in competition\r\nwith the larger crops of more humid climates. More elaborate\r\ninvestigations should be undertaken to determine the quality of\r\ncrops grown in different dry-farm districts. As far as possible each\r\nsection, great or small, should confine itself to the growing of a\r\nvariety of each crop yielding well and possessing the highest\r\nnutritive value. In that manner each section of the great dry-farm\r\nterritory would soon come to stand for some dependable special\r\nquality that would compel a first-class market. Further, the\r\nsuperior feeding value of dry-farm products should be thoroughly\r\nadvertised among the consumers in order to create a demand on the\r\nmarkets for a quality valuation. A few years of such systematic\r\nhonest work would do much to improve the financial basis of\r\ndry-farming.\r\n\r\nCHAPER XIV\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING THE SOIL FERTILITY\r\n\r\nAll plants when carefully burned leave a portion of ash, ranging\r\nwidely in quantity, averaging about 5 per cent, and often exceeding\r\n10 per cent of the dry weight of the plant. This plant ash\r\nrepresents inorganic substances taken from the soil by the roots. In\r\naddition, the nitrogen of plants, averaging about 2 per cent and\r\noften amounting to 4 per cent, which, in burning, passes off in\r\ngaseous form, is also usually taken from the soil by the plant\r\nroots. A comparatively large quantity of the plant is, therefore,\r\ndrawn directly from the soil. Among the ash ingredients are many\r\nwhich are taken up by the plant simply because they are present in\r\nthe soil; others, on the other hand, as has been shown by numerous\r\nclassical investigations, are indispensable to plant growth. If any\r\none of these indispensable ash ingredients be absent, it is\r\nimpossible for a plant to mature on such a soil. In fact, it is\r\npretty well established that, providing the physical conditions and\r\nthe water supply are satisfactory, the fertility of a soil depends\r\nlargely upon the amount of available ash ingredients, or plant-food.\r\n\r\nA clear distinction must be made between the_ total _and _available\r\n_plant-food. The essential plant-foods often occur in insoluble\r\ncombinations, valueless to plants; only the plant-foods that are\r\nsoluble in the soil-water or in the juices of plant roots are of\r\nvalue to plants. It is true that practically all soils contain all\r\nthe indispensable plant-foods; it is also true, however, that in\r\nmost soils they are present, as available plant-foods, in\r\ncomparatively small quantities. When crops are removed from the land\r\nyear after year, without any return being made, it naturally follows\r\nthat under ordinary conditions the amount of available plant-food is\r\ndiminished, with a strong probability of a corresponding diminution\r\nin crop-producing power. In fact, the soils of many of the older\r\ncountries have been permanently injured by continuous cropping, with\r\nnothing returned, practiced through centuries. Even in many of the\r\nyounger states, continuous cropping to wheat or other crops for a\r\ngeneration or less has resulted in a large decrease in the crop\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nPractice and experiment have shown that such diminishing fertility\r\nmay be retarded or wholly avoided, first, by so working or\r\ncultivating the soil as to set free much of the insoluble plant-food\r\nand, secondly, by returning to the soil all or part of the\r\nplant-food taken away. The recent development of the commercial\r\nfertilizer industry is a response to this truth. It may be said\r\nthat, so far as the agricultural soils of the world are now known,\r\nonly three of the essential plant-foods are likely to be absent,\r\nnamely, potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen; of these, by far the\r\nmost important is nitrogen. The whole question of maintaining the\r\nsupply of plant-foods in the soil concerns itself in the main with\r\nthe supply of these three substances.\r\n\r\nThe persistent fertility of dry-farms\r\n\r\nIn recent years, numerous farmers and some investigators have stated\r\nthat under dry-farm conditions the fertility of soils is not\r\nimpaired by cropping without manuring. This view has been taken\r\nbecause of the well-known fact that in localities where dry-farming\r\nhas been practiced on the same soils from twenty-five to forty-five\r\nyears, without the addition of manures, the average crop yield has\r\nnot only failed to diminish, but in most cases has increased. In\r\nfact, it is the almost unanimous testimony of the oldest dry-farmers\r\nof the United States, operating under a rainfall from twelve to\r\ntwenty inches, that the crop yields have increased as the cultural\r\nmethods have been perfected. If any adverse effect of the steady\r\nremoval of plant-foods has occurred, it has been wholly overshadowed\r\nby other factors. The older dry-farms in Utah, for instance, which\r\nare among the oldest of the country, have never been manured, yet\r\nare yielding better to-day than they did a generation ago. Strangely\r\nenough, this is not true of the irrigated farms, operating under\r\nlike soil and climatic conditions. This behavior of crop production\r\nunder dry-farm conditions has led to the belief that the question of\r\nsoil fertility is not an important one to dry-farmers. Nevertheless,\r\nif our present theories of plant nutrition are correct, it is also\r\ntrue that, if continuous cropping is practiced on our dry-farm soils\r\nwithout some form of manuring, the time must come when the\r\nproductive power of the soils will be injured and the only recourse\r\nof the farmer will be to return to the soils some of the plant-food\r\ntaken from it.\r\n\r\nThe view that soil fertility is not diminished by dry-farming\r\nappears at first sight to be strengthened by the results obtained by\r\ninvestigators who have made determinations of the actual plant-food\r\nin soils that have long been dry-farmed. The sparsely settled\r\ncondition of the dry-farm territory furnishes as yet an excellent\r\nopportunity to compare virgin and dry-farmed lands and which\r\nfrequently may be found side by side in even the older dry-farm\r\nsections. Stewart found that Utah dry-farm soils, cultivated for\r\nfifteen to forty years and never manured, were in many cases richer\r\nin nitrogen than neighboring virgin lands. Bradley found that the\r\nsoils of the great dry-farm wheat belt of Eastern Oregon contained,\r\nafter having been farmed for a quarter of a century, practically as\r\nmuch nitrogen as the adjoining virgin lands. These determinations\r\nwere made to a depth of eighteen inches. Alway and Trumbull, on the\r\nother hand, found in a soil from Indian Head, Saskatchewan, that in\r\ntwenty-five years of cultivation the total amount of nitrogen had\r\nbeen reduced about one third, though the alternation of fallow and\r\ncrop, commonly practiced in dry-farming, did not show a greater loss\r\nof soil nitrogen than other methods of cultivation. It must be kept\r\nin mind that the soil of Indian Head contains from two to three\r\ntimes as much nitrogen as is ordinarily found in the soils of the\r\nGreat Plains and from three to four times as much as is found in the\r\nsoils of the Great Basin and the High Plateaus. It may be assumed,\r\ntherefore, that the Indian Head soil was peculiarly liable to\r\nnitrogen losses. Headden, in an investigation of the nitrogen\r\ncontent of Colorado soils, has come to the conclusion that arid\r\nconditions, like those of Colorado, favor the direct accumulation of\r\nnitrogen in soils. All in all, the undiminished crop yield and the\r\ncomposition of the cultivated fields lead to the belief that\r\nsoil-fertility problems under dry-farm conditions are widely\r\ndifferent from the old well-known problems under humid conditions.\r\n\r\nReasons for dry-farming fertility\r\n\r\nIt is not really difficult to understand why the yields and,\r\napparently, the fertility of dry-farms have continued to increase\r\nduring the period of recorded dry-farm history--nearly half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFirst, the intrinsic fertility of arid as compared with humid soils\r\nis very high. (See Chapter V.) The production and removal of many\r\nsuccessive bountiful crops would not have as marked an effect on\r\narid as on humid soils, for both yield and composition change more\r\nslowly on fertile soils. The natural extraordinarily high fertility\r\nof dry-farm soils explains, therefore, primarily and chiefly, the\r\nincreasing yields on dry-farm soils that receive proper cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe intrinsic fertility of arid soils is not alone sufficient to\r\nexplain the increase in plant-food which undoubtedly occurs in the\r\nupper foot or two of cultivated dry-farm lands. In seeking a\r\nsuitable explanation of this phenomenon it must be recalled that the\r\nproportion of available plant-food in arid soils is very uniform to\r\ngreat depths, and that plants grown under proper dry-farm conditions\r\nare deep rooted and gather much nourishment from the lower soil\r\nlayers. As a consequence, the drain of a heavy crop does not fall\r\nupon the upper few feet as is usually the case in humid soils. The\r\ndry-farmer has several farms, one upon the other, which permit even\r\nimproper methods of farming to go on longer than would be the case\r\non shallower soils.\r\n\r\nThe great depth of arid soils further permits the storage of rain\r\nand snow water, as has been explained in previous chapters, to\r\ndepths of from ten to fifteen feet. As the growing season proceeds,\r\nthis water is gradually drawn towards the surface, and with it much\r\nof the plant-food dissolved by the water in the lower soil layers.\r\nThis process repeated year after year results in a concentration in\r\nthe upper soil layers of fertility normally distributed in the soil\r\nto the full depth reach by the soil-moisture. At certain seasons,\r\nespecially in the fall, this concentration may be detected with\r\ngreatest certainty. In general, the same action occurs in virgin\r\nlands, but the methods of dry-farm cultivation and cropping which\r\npermit a deeper penetration of the natural precipitation and a freer\r\nmovement of the soil-water result in a larger quantity of plant-food\r\nreaching the upper two or three feet from the lower soil depths.\r\nSuch concentration near the surface, when it is not excessive,\r\nfavors the production of increased yields of crops.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic high fertility and great depth of arid soils are\r\nprobably the two main factors explaining the apparent increase of\r\nthe fertility of dry-farms under a system of agriculture which does\r\nnot include the practice of manuring. Yet, there are other\r\nconditions that contribute largely to the result. For instance,\r\nevery cultural method accepted in dry-farming, such as deep plowing,\r\nfallowing, and frequent cultivation, enables the weathering forces\r\nto act upon the soil particles. Especially is it made easy for the\r\nair to enter the soil. Under such conditions, the plant-food\r\nunavailable to plants because of its insoluble condition is\r\nliberated and made available. The practice of dry-farming is of\r\nitself more conducive to such accumulation of available plant food\r\nthan are the methods of humid agriculture.\r\n\r\nFurther, the annual yield of any crop under conditions of\r\ndry-farming is smaller than under conditions of high rainfall. Less\r\nfertility is, therefore, removed by each crop and a given amount of\r\navailable fertility is sufficient to produce a large number of crops\r\nwithout showing signs of deficiency. The comparatively small annual\r\nyield of dry-farm crops is emphasized in view of the common practice\r\nof summer fallowing, which means that the land is cropped only every\r\nother year or possibly two years out of three. Under such conditions\r\nthe yield in any one year is cut in two to give an annual yield.\r\n\r\nThe use of the header wherever possible in harvesting dry-farm grain\r\nalso aids materially in maintaining soil fertility. By means of the\r\nheader only the heads of the grain are clipped off: the stalks are\r\nleft standing. In the fall, usually, this stubble is plowed under\r\nand gradually decays. In the earlier dry-farm days farmers feared\r\nthat under conditions of low rainfall, the stubble or straw plowed\r\nunder would not decay, but would leave the soil in a loose dry\r\ncondition unfavorable for the growth of plants. During the last\r\nfifteen years it has been abundantly demonstrated that if the\r\ncorrect methods of dry farming are followed, so that a fair balance\r\nof water is always found in the soil, even in the fall, the heavy,\r\nthick header stubble may be plowed into the soil with the certainty\r\nthat it will decay and thus enrich the soil. The header stubble\r\ncontains a very large proportion of the nitrogen that the crop has\r\ntaken from the soil and more than half of the potash and phosphoric\r\nacid. Plowing under the header stubble returns all this material to\r\nthe soil. Moreover, the bulk of the stubble is carbon taken from the\r\nair. This decays, forming various acid substances which act on the\r\nsoil grains to set free the fertility which they contain. At the end\r\nof the process of decay humus is formed, which is not only a\r\nstorehouse of plant-food, but effective in maintaining a good\r\nphysical condition of the soil. The introduction of the header in\r\ndry-farming was one of the big steps in making the practice certain\r\nand profitable.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be admitted that there are a great many more or\r\nless poorly understood or unknown forces at work in all soils which\r\naid in the maintenance of soil-fertility. Chief among these are the\r\nlow forms of life known as bacteria. Many of these, under favorable\r\nconditions, appear to have the power of liberating food from the\r\ninsoluble soil grains. Others have the power when settled on the\r\nroots of leguminous or pod-bearing plants to fix nitrogen from the\r\nair and convert it into a form suitable for the need of plants. In\r\nrecent years it has been found that other forms of bacteria, the\r\nbest known of which is azotobacter, have the power of gathering\r\nnitrogen from the air and combining it for the plant needs without\r\nthe presence of leguminous plants. These nitrogen-gathering bacteria\r\nutilize for their life processes the organic matter in the soil,\r\nsuch as the decaying header stubble, and at the same time enrich the\r\nsoil by the addition of combined nitrogen. Now, it so happens that\r\nthese important bacteria require a soil somewhat rich in lime, well\r\naerated and fairly dry and warm. These conditions are all met on the\r\nvast majority of our dry-farm soils, under the system of culture\r\noutlined in this volume. Hall maintains that to the activity of\r\nthese bacteria must be ascribed the large quantities of nitrogen\r\nfound in many virgin soils and probably the final explanation of the\r\nsteady nitrogen supply for dry farms is to be found in the work of\r\nthe azatobacter and related forms of low life. The potash and\r\nphosphoric acid supply can probably be maintained for ages by proper\r\nmethods of cultivation, though the phosphoric acid will become\r\nexhausted long before the potash. The nitrogen supply, however, must\r\ncome from without. The nitrogen question will undoubtedly soon be\r\nthe one before the students of dry-farm fertility. A liberal supply\r\nof organic matter In the soil with cultural methods favoring the\r\ngrowth of the nitrogen-gathering bacteria appears at present to be\r\nthe first solution of the nitrogen question. Meanwhile, the activity\r\nof the nitrogen-gathering bacteria, like azotobacter, is one of our\r\nbest explanations of the large presence of nitrogen in cultivated\r\ndry-farm soils.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the apparent increase in productivity and plant-food\r\ncontent of dry-farm soils can best be explained by a consideration\r\nof these factors: (1) the intrinsically high fertility of the arid\r\nsoils; (2) the deep feeding ground for the deep root systems of\r\ndry-farm crops; (3) the concentration of the plant food distributed\r\nthroughout the soil by the upward movement of the natural\r\nprecipitation stored in the soil; (4) the cultural methods of\r\ndry-farming which enable the weathering agencies to liberate freely\r\nand vigorously the plant-food of the soil grains; (5) the small\r\nannual crops; (6) the plowing under of the header straw, and (7) the\r\nactivity of bacteria that gather nitrogen directly from the air.\r\n\r\nMethods of conserving soil-fertility\r\n\r\nIn view of the comparatively small annual crops that characterize\r\ndry-farming it is not wholly impossible that the factors above\r\ndiscussed, if properly applied, could liberate the latent plant-food\r\nof the soil and gather all necessary nitrogen for the plants. Such\r\nan equilibrium, could it once be established, would possibly\r\ncontinue for long periods of time, but in the end would no doubt\r\nlead to disaster; for, unless the very cornerstone of modern\r\nagricultural science is unsound, there will be ultimately a\r\ndiminution of crop producing power if continuous cropping is\r\npracticed without returning to the soil a goodly portion of the\r\nelements of soil fertility taken from it. The real purpose of modern\r\nagricultural researeh is to maintain or increase the productivity of\r\nour lands; if this cannot be done, modern agriculture is essentially\r\na failure. Dry-farming, as the newest and probably in the future one\r\nof the greatest divisions of modern agriculture, must from the\r\nbeginning seek and apply processes that will insure steadiness in\r\nthe productive power of its lands. Therefore, from the very\r\nbeginning dry-farmers must look towards the conservation of the\r\nfertility of their soils.\r\n\r\nThe first and most rational method of maintaining the fertility of\r\nthe soil indefinitely is to return to the soil everything that is\r\ntaken from it. In practice this can be done only by feeding the\r\nproducts of the farm to live stock and returning to the soil the\r\nmanure, both solid and liquid, produced by the animals. This brings\r\nup at once the much discussed question of the relation between the\r\nlive stock industry and dry-farming. While it is undoubtedly true\r\nthat no system of agriculture will be wholly satisfactory to the\r\nfarmer and truly beneficial to the state, unless it is connected\r\ndefinitely with the production of live stock, yet it must be\r\nadmitted that the present prevailing dry-farm conditions do not\r\nalways favor comfortable animal life. For instance, over a large\r\nportion of the central area of the dry-farm territory the dry-farms\r\nare at considerable distances from running or well water. In many\r\ncases, water is hauled eight or ten miles for the supply of the men\r\nand horses engaged in farming. Moreover, in these drier districts,\r\nonly certain crops, carefully cultivated, will yield profitably, and\r\nthe pasture and the kitchen garden are practical impossibilities\r\nfrom an economic point of view. Such conditions, though profitable\r\ndry-farming is feasible, preclude the existence of the home and the\r\nbarn on or even near the farm. When feed must be hauled many miles,\r\nthe profits of the live stock industry are materially reduced and\r\nthe dry-farmer usually prefers to grow a crop of wheat, the straw of\r\nwhich may be plowed under the soil to the great advantage of the\r\nfollowing crop. In dry-farm districts where the rainfall is higher\r\nor better distributed, or where the ground water is near the\r\nsurface, there should be no reason why dry-farming and live stock\r\nshould not go hand in hand. Wherever water is within reach, the\r\nhomestead is also possible. The recent development of the gasoline\r\nmotor for pumping purposes makes possible a small home garden\r\nwherever a little water is available. The lack of water for culinary\r\npurposes is really the problem that has stood between the joint\r\ndevelopment of dry-farming and the live stock industry. The whole\r\nmatter, however, looks much more favorable to-day, for the efforts\r\nof the Federal and state governments have succeeded in discovering\r\nnumerous subterranean sources of water in dry-farm districts. In\r\naddition, the development of small irrigation systems in the\r\nneighborhood of dry-farm districts is helping the cause of the live\r\nstock industry. At the present time, dry-farming and the live stock\r\nindustry are rather far apart, though undoubtedly as the desert is\r\nconquered they will become more closely associated. The question\r\nconcerning the best maintenance of soil-fertility remains the same;\r\nand the ideal way of maintaining fertility is to return to the soil\r\nas much as is possible of the plant-food taken from it by the crops,\r\nwhich can best be accomplished by the development of the business of\r\nkeeping live stock in connection with dry-farming.\r\n\r\nIf live stock cannot be kept on a dry-farm, the most direct method\r\nof maintaining soil-fertility is by the application of commercial\r\nfertilizers. This practice is followed extensively in the Eastern\r\nstates and in Europe. The large areas of dry-farms and the high\r\nprices of commercial fertilizers will make this method of manuring\r\nimpracticable on dry-farms, and it may be dismissed from thought\r\nuntil such a day as conditions, especially with respect to price of\r\nnitrates and potash, are materially changed.\r\n\r\nNitrogen, which is the most important plant-food that may be absent\r\nfrom dry-farm soils, may be secured by the proper use of leguminous\r\ncrops. All the pod-bearing plants commonly cultivated, such as peas,\r\nbeans, vetch, clover, and lucern, are able to secure large\r\nquantities of nitrogen from the air through the activity of bacteria\r\nthat live and grow on the roots of such plants. The leguminous crop\r\nshould be sown in the usual way, and when it is well past the\r\nflowering stage should be plowed into the ground. Naturally, annual\r\nlegumes, such as peas and beans, should be used for this purpose.\r\nThe crop thus plowed under contains much nitrogen, which is\r\ngradually changed into a form suitable for plant assimilation. In\r\naddition, the acid substances produced in the decay of the plants\r\ntend to liberate the insoluble plant-foods and the organic matter is\r\nfinally changed into humus. In order to maintain a proper supply of\r\nnitrogen in the soil the dry-farmer will probably soon find himself\r\nobliged to grow, every five years or oftener, a crop of legumes to\r\nbe plowed under.\r\n\r\nNon-leguminous crops may also be plowed under for the purpose of\r\nadding organic matter and humus to the soil, though this has little\r\nadvantage over the present method of heading the grain and plowing\r\nunder the high stubble. The header system should be generally\r\nadopted on wheat dry-farms. On farms where corn is the chief crop,\r\nperhaps more importance needs to be given to the supply of organic\r\nmatter and humus than on wheat farms. The occasional plowing under\r\nof leguminous crops would he the most satisfactory method. The\r\npersistent application of the proper cultural methods of dry-farming\r\nwill set free the most important plant-foods, and on well-cultivated\r\nfarms nitrogen is the only element likely to be absent in serious\r\namounts.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of crops on dry-farms is usually advocated in districts\r\nlike the Great Plains area, where the annual rainfall is over\r\nfifteen inches and the major part of the precipitation comes in\r\nspring and summer. The various rotations ordinarily include one or\r\nmore crops of small grains, a hoed crop like corn or potatoes, a\r\nleguminous crop, and sometimes a fallow year. The leguminous crop is\r\ngrown to secure a fresh supply of nitrogen; the hoed crop, to enable\r\nthe air and sunshine to act thoroughly on the soil grains and to\r\nliberate plant-food, such as potash and phosphoric acid; and the\r\ngrain crops to take up plant-food not reached by the root systems of\r\nthe other plants. The subject of proper rotation of crops has always\r\nbeen a difficult one, and very little information exists on it as\r\npracticed on dry-farms. Chilcott has done considerable work on\r\nrotations in the Great Plains district, hut he frankly admits that\r\nmany years of trial will he necessary for the elucidation of\r\ntrustworthy principles. Some of the best rotations found by Chilcott\r\nup to the present are:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCorn--Wheat--Oats\r\nBarley--Oats--Corn\r\nFallow--Wheat--Oats\r\n\r\n\r\nRosen states that rotation is very commonly practiced in the dry\r\nsections of southern Russia, usually including an occasional Summer\r\nfallow. As a type of an eight-year rotation practiced at the Poltava\r\nStation, the following is given: (1) Summer tilled and manured; (2)\r\nwinter wheat; (3) hoed crop; (4) spring wheat; (5) summer fallow;\r\n(6) winter rye; (7) buckwheat or an annual legume; (8) oats. This\r\nrotation, it may be observed, includes the grain crop, hoed crop,\r\nlegume, and fallow every four years.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated elsewhere, any rotation in dry-farming which does\r\nnot include the summer fallow at least every third or fourth year is\r\nlikely to be dangerous In years of deficient rainfall.\r\n\r\nThis review of the question of dry-farm fertility is intended merely\r\nas a forecast of coming developments. At the present time\r\nsoil-fertility is not giving the dry-farmers great concern, but as\r\nin the countries of abundant rainfall the time will come when it\r\nwill be equal to that of water conservation, unless indeed the\r\ndry-farmers heed the lessons of the past and adopt from the start\r\nproper practices for the maintenance of the plant-food stored in the\r\nsoil. The principle explained in Chapter IX, that the amount of\r\nwater required for the production of one pound of water diminishes\r\nas the fertility increases, shows the intimate relationship that\r\nexists between the soil-fertility and the soil-water and the\r\nimportance of maintaining dry-farm soils at a high state of\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTS FOR DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheap land and relatively small acre yields characterize\r\ndry-farming. Consequently Iarger areas must be farmed for a given\r\nreturn than in humid farming, and the successful pursuit of\r\ndry-farming compels the adoption of methods that enable a man to do\r\nthe largest amount of effective work with the smallest expenditure\r\nof energy. The careful observations made by Grace, in Utah, lead to\r\nthe belief that, under the conditions prevailing in the\r\nintermountain country, one man with four horses and a sufficient\r\nsupply of machinery can farm 160 acres, half of which is\r\nsummer-fallowed every year; and one man may, in favorable seasons\r\nunder a carefully planned system, farm as much as 200 acres. If one\r\nman attempts to handle a larger farm, the work is likely to be done\r\nin so slipshod a manner that the crop yield decreases and the total\r\nreturns are no larger than if 200 acres had been well tilled.\r\n\r\nOne man with four horses would be unable to handle even 160 acres\r\nwere it not for the possession of modern machinery; and dry-farming,\r\nmore than any other system of agriculture, is dependent for its\r\nsuccess upon the use of proper implements of tillage. In fact, it is\r\nvery doubtful if the reclamation of the great arid and semiarid\r\nregions of the world would have been possible a few decades ago,\r\nbefore the invention and introduction of labor-saving farm\r\nmachinery. It is undoubtedly further a fact that the future of\r\ndry-farming is closely bound up with the improvements that may be\r\nmade in farm machinery. Few of the agricultural implements on the\r\nmarket to-day have been made primarily for dry-farm conditions. The\r\nbest that the dry-farmer can do is to adapt the implements on the\r\nmarket to his special needs. Possibly the best field of\r\ninvestigation for the experiment stations and inventive minds in the\r\narid region is farm mechanics as applied to the special needs of\r\ndry-farming.\r\n\r\nClearing and breaking\r\n\r\nA large portion of the dry-farm territory of the United States is\r\ncovered with sagebrush and related plants. It is always a difficult\r\nand usually an expensive problem to clear sagebrush land, for the\r\nshrubs are frequently from two to six feet high, correspondingly\r\ndeep-rooted, with very tough wood. When the soil is dry, it is\r\nextremely difficult to pull out sagebrush, and of necessity much of\r\nthe clearing must be done during the dry season. Numerous devices\r\nhave been suggested and tried for the purpose of clearing sagebrush\r\nland. One of the oldest and also one of the most effective devices\r\nis two parallel railroad rails connected with heavy iron chains and\r\nused as a drag over the sagebrush land. The sage is caught by the\r\ntwo rails and torn out of the ground. The clearing is fairly\r\ncomplete, though it is generally necessary to go over the ground two\r\nor three times before the work is completed. Even after such\r\ntreatment a large number of sagebrush clumps, found standing over\r\nthe field, must be grubbed up with the hoe. Another and effective\r\ndevice is the so-called \"mankiller.\" This implement pulls up the\r\nsage very successfully and drops it at certain definite intervals.\r\nIt is, however, a very dangerous implement and frequently results in\r\ninjury to the men who work it. Of recent years another device has\r\nbeen tried with a great deal of success. It is made like a snow plow\r\nof heavy railroad irons to which a number of large steel knives have\r\nbeen bolted. Neither of these implements is wholly satisfactory, and\r\nan acceptable machine for grubbing sagebrush is yet to be devised.\r\nIn view of the large expense attached to the clearing of sagebrush\r\nland such a machine would be of great help in the advancement of\r\ndry-farming.\r\n\r\nAway from the sagebrush country the virgin dry-farm land is usually\r\ncovered with a more or less dense growth of grass, though true sod\r\nis seldom found under dry-farm conditions. The ordinary breaking\r\nplow, characterized by a long sloping moldboard, is the best known\r\nimplement for breaking all kinds of sod. (See Fig. 7a a.) Where the\r\nsod is very light, as on the far western prairies, the more ordinary\r\nforms of plows may be used. In still other sections, the dry-farm\r\nland is covered with a scattered growth of trees, frequently pinion\r\npine and cedars, and in Arizona and New Mexico the mesquite tree and\r\ncacti are to be removed. Such clearing has to be done in accordance\r\nwith the special needs of the locality.\r\n\r\nPlowing\r\n\r\nPlowing, or the turning over of the soil to a depth of from seven to\r\nten inches for every crop, is a fundamental operation of\r\ndry-farming. The plow, therefore, becomes one of the most important\r\nimplements on the dry-farm. Though the plow as an agricultural\r\nimplement is of great antiquity, it is only within the last one\r\nhundred years that it has attained its present perfection. It is a\r\nquestion even to-day, in the minds of a great many students, whether\r\nthe modern plow should not be replaced by some machine even more\r\nsuitable for the proper turning and stirring of the soil. The\r\nmoldboard plow is, everything considered, the most satisfactory plow\r\nfor dry-farm purposes. A plow with a moldboard possessing a short\r\nabrupt curvature is generally held to be the most valuable for\r\ndry-farm purposes, since it pulverizes the soil most thoroughly, and\r\nin dry-farming it is not so important to turn the soil over as to\r\ncrumble and loosen it thoroughly. Naturally, since the areas of\r\ndry-farms are very large, the sulky or riding plow is the only kind\r\nto be used. The same may be said of all other dry-farm implements.\r\nAs far as possible, they should be of the riding kind since in the\r\nend it means economy from the resulting saving of energy.\r\n\r\nThe disk plow has recently come into prominent use throughout the\r\nland. It consists, as is well known, of one or more large disks\r\nwhich are believed to cause a smaller draft, as they cut into the\r\nground, than the draft due to the sliding friction upon the\r\nmoldboard. Davidson and Chase say, however, that the draft of a disk\r\nplow is often heavier in proportion to the work done and the plow\r\nitself is more clumsy than the moldboard plow. For ordinary dry-farm\r\npurposes the disk plow has no advantage over the modern moldboard\r\nplow. Many of the dry-farm soils are of a heavy clay and become very\r\nsticky during certain seasons of the year. In such soils the disk\r\nplow is very useful. It is also true that dry-farm soils, subjected\r\nto the intense heat of the western sun become very hard. In the\r\nhandling of such soils the disk plow has been found to be most\r\nuseful. The common experience of dry-farmers is that when sagebrush\r\nlands have been the first plowing can be most successfully done with\r\nthe disk plow, but that after. the first crop has been harvested,\r\nthe stubble land can be best handled with the moldboard plow. All\r\nthis, however, is yet to be subjected to further tests.\r\n\r\nWhile subsoiling results in a better storage reservoir for water and\r\nconsequently makes dry-farming more secure, yet the high cost of the\r\npractice will probably never make it popular. Subsoiling is\r\naccomplished in two ways: either by an ordinary moldboard plow which\r\nfollows the plow in the plow furrow and thus turns the soil to a\r\ngreater depth, or by some form of the ordinary subsoil plow. In\r\ngeneral, the subsoil plow is simply a vertical piece of cutting\r\niron, down to a depth of ten to eighteen inches, at the bottom of\r\nwhich is fastened a triangular piece of iron like a shovel, which,\r\nwhen pulled through the ground, tends to loosen the soil to the full\r\ndepth of the plow.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil plow does not turn the soil; it simply loosens the soil\r\nso that the air and plant roots can penetrate to greater depths.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of plows and their proper use the dryfarmer must be\r\nguided wholly by the conditions under which he is working. It is\r\nimpossible at the present time to lay down definite laws stating\r\nwhat plows are best for certain soils. The soils of the arid region\r\nare not well enough known, nor has the relationship between the plow\r\nand the soil been sufficiently well established. As above remarked,\r\nhere is one of the great fields for investigation for both\r\nscientific and practical men for years to come.\r\n\r\nMaking and maintaining a soil-mulch\r\n\r\nAfter the land has been so well plowed that the rains can enter\r\neasily, the next operation of importance in dry-farming is the\r\nmaking and maintaining of a soil-mulch over the ground to prevent\r\nthe evaporation of water from the soil. For this purpose some form\r\nof harrow is most commonly used. The oldest and best-known harrow is\r\nthe ordinary smoothing harrow, which is composed of iron or steel\r\nteeth of various shapes set in a suitable frame. (See Fig. 79.) For\r\ndry-farm purposes the implement must be so made as to enable the\r\nfarmer to set the harrow teeth to slant backward or forward. It\r\nfrequently happens that in the spring the grain is too thick for the\r\nmoisture in the soil, and it then becomes necessary to tear out some\r\nof the young plants. For this purpose the harrow teeth are set\r\nstraight or forward and the crop can then be thinned effectively. At\r\nother times it may be observed in the spring that the rains and\r\nwinds have led to the formation of a crust over the soil, which must\r\nbe broken to let the plants have full freedom of growth and\r\ndevelopment. This is accomplished by slanting the harrow teeth\r\nbackward, and the crust may then be broken without serious injury to\r\nthe plants. The smoothing harrow is a very useful implement on the\r\ndry-farm. For following the plow, however, a more useful implement\r\nis the disk harrow, which is a comparatively recent invention. It\r\nconsists of a series of disks which may be set at various angles\r\nwith the line of traction and thus be made to turn over the soil\r\nwhile at the same time pulverizing it. The best dry-farm practice is\r\nto plow in the fall and let the soil lie in the rough during the\r\nwinter months. In the spring the land is thoroughly disked and\r\nreduced to a fine condition. Following this the smoothing harrow is\r\noccasionally used to form a more perfect mulch. When seeding is to\r\nbe done immediately after plowing, the plow is followed by the disk\r\nharrow, and that in turn is followed by the smoothing harrow. The\r\nground is then ready for seeding. The disk harrow is also used\r\nextensively throughout the summer in maintaining a proper mulch. It\r\ndoes its work more effectively than the ordinary smoothing harrow\r\nand is, therefore, rapidly displacing all other forms of harrows for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining a layer of loose soil over the dry-farm.\r\nThere are several kinds of disk harrows used by dry-farmers. The\r\nfull disk is, everything considered, the most useful. The cutaway\r\nharrow is often used in cultivating old alfalfa land; the spade disk\r\nharrow has a very limited application in dry-farming; and the\r\norchard disk harrow is simply a modlfication of the full disk harrow\r\nwhereby the farmer is able to travel between the rows of trees and\r\nso to cultivate the soil under the branches of the trees without\r\ninjuring the leaves or fruit.\r\n\r\nOne of the great difficulties in dry-farming concerns itself with\r\nthe prevention of the growth of weeds or volunteer crops. As has\r\nbeen explained in previous chapters, weeds require as much water for\r\ntheir growth as wheat or other useful crops. During the fallow\r\nseason, the farmer is likely to be overtaken by the weeds and lose\r\nmuch of the value of the fallow by losing soil-moisture through the\r\ngrowth of weeds. Under the most favorable conditions weeds are\r\ndifficult to handle. The disk harrow itself is not effective. The\r\nsmoothing harrow is of less value. There is at the present time\r\ngreat need for some implement that will effectively destroy young\r\nweeds and prevent their further growth. Attempts are being made to\r\ninvent such implements, but up to the present without great success.\r\nHogenson reports the finding of an implement on a western dry-farm\r\nconstructed by the farmer himself which for a number of years has\r\nshown itself of high efficiency in keeping the dry-farm free from\r\nweeds. Several improved modifications of this implement have been\r\nmade and tried out on the famous dry-farm district at Nephi, Utah,\r\nand with the greatest success. Hunter reports a similar implement in\r\ncommon use on the dry-farms of the Columbia Basin. Spring tooth\r\nharrows are also used in a small way on the dry-farms.\r\n\r\nThey have no special advantage over the smoothing harrow or the disk\r\nharrow, except in places where the attempt is made to cultivate the\r\nsoil between the rows of wheat. The curved knife tooth harrow is\r\nscareely ever used on dry-farms. It has some value as a pulverizer,\r\nbut does not seem to have any real advantage over the ordinary disk\r\nharrow.\r\n\r\nCultivators for stirring the land on which crops are growing are not\r\nused extensively on dry-farms. Usually the spring tooth harrow is\r\nemployed for this work. In dry-farm sections, where corn is grown,\r\nthe cultivator is frequently used throughout the season. Potatoes\r\ngrown on dry-farms should be cultivated throughout the season, and\r\nas the potato industry grows in the dry-farm territory there will be\r\na greater demand for suitable cultivators. The cultivators to be\r\nused on dry-farms are all of the riding kind. They should be so\r\narranged that the horse walking between two rows carries a\r\ncultivator that straddles several rows of plants and cultivates the\r\nsoil between. Disks, shovels, or spring teeth may be used on\r\ncultivators. There is a great variety on the market, and each farmer\r\nwill have to choose such as meet most definitely his needs.\r\n\r\nThe various forms of harrows and cultivators are of the greatest\r\nimportance in the development of dry-farming. Unless a proper mulch\r\ncan be kept over the soil during the fallow season, and as far as\r\npossible during the growing season, first-class crops cannot be\r\nfully respected.\r\n\r\nThe roller is occasionally used in dry-farming, especially in the\r\nuplands of the Columbia Basin. It is a somewhat dangerous implement\r\nto use where water conservation is important, since the packing\r\nresulting from the roller tends to draw water upward from the lower\r\nsoil layers to be evaporated into the air. Wherever the roller is\r\nused, therefore, it should be followed immediately by a harrow. It\r\nis valuable chiefly in the localities where the soil is very loose\r\nand light and needs packing around the seeds to permit perfect\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\nSubsurface packing\r\n\r\nThe subsurface packer invented by Campbell is [shown in Figure\r\n83--not shown--ed.]. The wheels of this machine eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, with rims one inch thick at the inner part, beveled two\r\nand a half inches to a sharp outer edge, are placed on a shaft, five\r\ninches apart. In practice about five hundred pounds of weight are\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThis machine, according to Campbell, crowds a one-inch wedge into\r\nevery five inches of soil with a lateral and a downward pressure and\r\nthus packs firmly the soil near the bottom of the plow-furrow.\r\nSubsurface packing aims to establish full capillary connection\r\nbetween the plowed upper soil and the undisturbed lower soil-layer;\r\nto bring the moist soil in close contact with the straw or organic\r\nlitter plowed under and thus to hasten decomposition, and to provide\r\na firm seed bed.\r\n\r\nThe subsurface packer probably has some value where the plowed soil\r\ncontaining the stubble is somewhat loose; or on soils which do not\r\npermit of a rapid decay of stubble and other organic matter that may\r\nbe plowed under from season to season. On such soils the packing\r\ntendency of the subsurface packer may help prevent loss of soil\r\nwater, and may also assist in furnishing a more uniform medium\r\nthrough which plant roots may force their way. For all these\r\npurposes, the disk is usually equally efficient.\r\n\r\nSowing\r\n\r\nIt has already been indicated in previous chapters that proper\r\nsowing is one of the most important operations of the dry-farm,\r\nquite comparable in importance with plowing or the maintaining of a\r\nmulch for retaining soil-moisture. The old-fashioned method of\r\nbroadcasting has absolutely no place on a dry-farm. The success of\r\ndry-farming depends entirely upon the control that the farmer has of\r\nall the operations of the farm. By broadcasting, neither the\r\nquantity of seed used nor the manner of placing the seed in the\r\nground can be regulated. Drill culture, therefore, introduced by\r\nJethro Tull two hundred years ago, which gives the farmer full\r\ncontrol over the process of seeding, is the only system to be used.\r\nThe numerous seed drills on the market all employ the same\r\nprinciples. Their variations are few and simple. In all seed drills\r\nthe seed is forced into tubes so placed as to enable the seed to\r\nfall into the furrows in the ground. The drills themselves are\r\ndistinguished almost wholly by the type of the furrow opener and the\r\ncovering devices which are used. The seed furrow is opened either by\r\na small hoe or a so-called shoe or disk. At the present time it\r\nappears that the single disk is the coming method of opening the\r\nseed furrow and that the other methods will gradually disappear. As\r\nthe seed is dropped into the furrow thus made it is covered by some\r\ndevice at the rear of the machine. One of the oldest methods as well\r\nas one of the most satisfactory is a series of chains dragging\r\nbehind the drill and covering the furrow quite completely. It is,\r\nhowever, very desirable that the soil should be pressed carefully\r\naround the seed so that germination may begin with the least\r\ndifficulty whenever the temperature conditions are right. Most of\r\nthe drills of the day are, therefore, provided with large light\r\nwheels, one for each furrow, which press lightly upon the soil and\r\nforce the soil into intimate contact with the seed The weakness of\r\nsuch an arrangement is that the soil along the drill furrows is left\r\nsomewhat packed, which leads to a ready escape of the soil-moisture.\r\nMany of the drills are so arranged that press wheels may be used at\r\nthe pleasure of the farmer. The seed drill is already a very useful\r\nimplement and is rapidly being made to meet the special requirements\r\nof the dry-farmer. Corn planters are used almost exclusively on\r\ndry-farms where corn is the leading crop. In principle they are very\r\nmuch the same as the press drills. Potatoes are also generally\r\nplanted by machinery. Wherever seeding machinery has been\r\nconstructed based upon the principles of dry-farming, it is a very\r\nadvantageous adjunct to the dry-farm.\r\n\r\nHarvesting\r\n\r\nThe immense areas of dry-farms are harvested almost wholly by the\r\nmost modern machinery. For grain, the harvester is used almost\r\nexclusively in the districts where the header cannot be used, but\r\nwherever conditions permit, the header is and should be used. It has\r\nbeen explained in previous chapters how valuable the tall header\r\nstubble is when plowed under as a means of maintaining the fertility\r\nof the soil. Besides, there is an ease in handling the header which\r\nis not known with the harvester. There are times when the header\r\nleads to some waste as, for instance, when the wheat is very low and\r\nheads are missed as the machine passes over the ground. In many\r\nsections of the dry-farm territory the climatic conditions are such\r\nthat the wheat cures perfectly while still standing. In such places\r\nthe combined harvester and thresher is used. The header cuts off the\r\nheads of the grain, which are passed up into the thresher, and bags\r\nfilled with threshed grain are dropped along the path of the\r\nmachine, while the straw is scattered over the ground. Wherever such\r\na machine can be used, it has been found to be economical and\r\nsatisfactory. Of recent years corn stalks have been used to better\r\nadvantage than in the past, for not far from one half of the feeding\r\nvalue of the corn crop is in the stalks, which up to a few years ago\r\nwere very largely wasted. Corn harvesters are likewise on the market\r\nand are quite generally used. It was manifestly impossible on large\r\nplaces to harvest corn by hand and large corn harvesters have,\r\ntherefore, been made for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSteam and other motive power\r\n\r\nRecently numerous persons have suggested that the expense of running\r\na dry-farm could be materially reduced by using some motive power\r\nother than horses. Steam, gasoline, and electricity have all been\r\nsuggested. The steam traction engine is already a fairly\r\nwell-developed machine and it has been used for plowing purposes on\r\nmany dry-farms in nearly all the sections of the dry-farm territory.\r\nUnfortunately, up to the present it has not shown itself to be very\r\nsatisfactory. First of all it is to be remembered that the\r\nprinciples of dry-farming require that the topsoil be kept very\r\nloose and spongy. The great traction engines have very wide wheels\r\nof such tremendous weight that they press down the soil very\r\ncompactly along their path and in that way defeat one of the\r\nimportant purposes of tillage. Another objection to them is that at\r\npresent their construction is such as to result in continual\r\nbreakages. While these breakages in themselves are small and\r\ninexpensive, they mean the cessation of all farming operations\r\nduring the hour or day required for repairs. A large crew of men is\r\nthus left more or less idle, to the serious injury of the work and\r\nto the great expense of the owner. Undoubtedly, the traction engine\r\nhas a place in dry-farming, but it has not yet been perfected to\r\nsuch a degree as to make it satisfactory. On heavy soils it is much\r\nmore useful than on light soils. When the traction engine works\r\nsatisfactorily, plowing may be done at a cost considerably lower\r\nthan when horses are employed.\r\n\r\nIn England, Germany, and other European countries some of the\r\ndifficulties connected with plowing have been overcome by using two\r\nengines on the two opposite sides of a field. These engines move\r\nsynchronously together and, by means of large cables, plows,\r\nharrows, or seeders, are pulled back and forth over the field. This\r\nmethod seems to give good satisfaction on many large estates of the\r\nold world. Macdonald reports that such a system is in successful\r\noperation in the Transvaal in South Africa and is doing work there\r\nat a very knew cost. The large initial cost of such a system will,\r\nof course, prohibit its use except on the very large farms that are\r\nbeing established in the dry-farm territory.\r\n\r\nGasoline engines are also being tried out, but up to date they have\r\nnot shown themselves as possessing superior advantages over the\r\nsteam engines. The two objections to them are the same as to the\r\nsteam engine: first, their great weight, which compresses in a\r\ndangerous degree the topsoil and, secondly, the frequent breakages,\r\nwhich make the operation slow and expensive.\r\n\r\nOver a great part of the West, water power is very abundant and the\r\nsuggestion has been made that the electric energy which can be\r\ndeveloped by means of water power could be used in the cultural\r\noperations of the dry-farm. With the development of the trolley car\r\nwhich does not run on rails it would not seem impossible that in\r\nfavorable localities electricity could be made to serve the farmer\r\nin the mechanical tillage of the dry-farm.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of steam and other energy for horse power is yet in\r\nthe future. Undoubtedly, it will come, but only as improvements are\r\nmade in the machines. There is here also a great field for being of\r\nhigh service to the farmers who are attempting to reclaim the great\r\ndeserts of the world. As stated at the beginning of this chapter,\r\ndry-farming would probably have been an impossibilityfifty or a\r\nhundred years ago because of the absence of suitable machinery. The\r\nfuture of dry-farming rests almost wholly, so far as its profits are\r\nconcerned, upon the development of new and more suitable machinery\r\nfor the tillage of the soil in accordance with the established\r\nprinciples of dry-farming.\r\n\r\nFinally, the recommendations made by Merrill may here be inserted. A\r\ndry-farmer for best work should be supplied with the following\r\nimplements in addition to the necessary wagons and hand tools:--\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Plow.\r\nOne Disk.\r\nOne Smoothing Harrow.\r\nOne Drill Seeder.\r\nOne Harvester or Header.\r\nOne Mowing Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION AND DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigation-farming and dry-farming are both systems of agriculture\r\ndevised for the reclamation of countries that ordinarily receive an\r\nannual rainfall of twenty inches or less. Irrigation-farming cannot\r\nof itself reclaim the arid regions of the world, for the available\r\nwater supply of arid countries when it shall have been conserved in\r\nthe best possible way cannot be made to irrigate more than one fifth\r\nof the thirsty land. This means that under the highest possible\r\ndevelopment of irrigation, at least in the United States, there will\r\nbe five or six acres of unirrigated or dry-farm land for every acre\r\nof irrigated land. Irrigation development cannot possibly,\r\ntherefore, render the dry-farm movement valueless. On the other\r\nhand, dry-farming is furthered by the development of irrigation\r\nfarming, for both these systems of agriculture are characterized by\r\nadvantages that make irrigation and dry-farming supplementary to\r\neach other in the successful development of any arid region.\r\n\r\nUnder irrigation, smaller areas need to be cultivated for the same\r\ncrop returns, for it has been amply demonstrated that the acre\r\nyields under proper irrigation are very much larger than the best\r\nyields under the most careful system of dry-farming. Secondly, a\r\ngreater variety of crops may be grown on the irrigated farm than on\r\nthe dry-farm. As has already been shown in this volume, only certain\r\ndrouth resistant crops can be grown profitably upon dry-farms, and\r\nthese must be grown under the methods of extensive farming. The\r\nlonger growing crops, including trees, succulent vegetables, and a\r\nvariety of small fruits, have not as yet been made to yield\r\nprofitably under arid conditions without the artificial application\r\nof water. Further, the irrigation-farmer is not largely dependent\r\nupon the weather and, therefore, carries on this work with a feeling\r\nof greater security. Of course, it is true that the dry years affect\r\nthe flow of water in the canals and that the frequent breaking of\r\ndams and canal walls leaves the farmer helpless in the face of the\r\nblistering heat. Yet, all in all, a greater feeling of security is\r\npossessed by the irrigation farmer than by the dry-farmer.\r\n\r\nMost important, however, are the temperamental differences in men\r\nwhich make some desirous of giving themselves to the cultivation of\r\na small area of irrigated land under intensive conditions and others\r\nto dry-farming under extensive conditions. In fact, it is being\r\nobserved in the arid region that men, because of their temperamental\r\ndifferences, are gradually separating into the two classes of\r\nirrigation-farmers and dry-farmers. The dry-farms of necessity cover\r\nmuch larger areas than the irrigated farms. The land is cheaper and\r\nthe crops are smaller. The methods to be applied are those of\r\nextensive farming. The profits on the investment also appear to be\r\nsomewhat larger. The very necessity of pitting intellect against the\r\nfierceness of the drouth appears to have attracted many-men to the\r\ndry-farms. Gradually the certainty of producing crops on dry-farms\r\nfrom season to season is becoming established, and the essential\r\ndifference between the two kinds of farming in the arid districts\r\nwill then he the difference between intensive and extensive methods\r\nof culture. Men will be attracted to one or other of these systems\r\nof agriculture according to their personal inclinations.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of water\r\n\r\nFor the development of a well-rounded commonwealth in an arid region\r\nit is, of course, indispensable that irrigation be practiced, for\r\ndry-farming of itself will find it difficult to build up populous\r\ncities and to supply the great variety of crops demanded by the\r\nmodern family. In fact, one of the great problems before those\r\nengaged in the development of dry-farming at present is the\r\ndevelopment of homesteads in the dry-farms. A homestead is possible\r\nonly where there is a sufficient amount of free water available for\r\nhousehold and stock purposes. In the portion of the dry-farm\r\nterritory where the rainfall approximates twenty inches, this\r\nproblem is not so very difficult, since ground water may be reached\r\neasily. In the drier portions, however, where the rainfall is\r\nbetween ten and fifteen inches, the problem is much more important.\r\nThe conditions that bring the district under the dry-farm\r\ndesignation imply a scarcity of water. On few dry-farms is water\r\navailable for the needs of the household and the barns. In the Rocky\r\nMountain states numerous dry-farms have been developed from seven to\r\nfifteen miles from the nearest source of water, and the main expense\r\nof developing these farms has been the hauling of water to the farms\r\nto supply the needs of the men and beasts at work on them.\r\nNaturally, it is impossible to establish homesteads on the dry-farms\r\nunless at least a small supply of water is available; and\r\ndry-farming will never he what it might be unless happy homes can be\r\nestablished upon the farms in the arid regions that grow crops\r\nwithout irrigation. To make a dry-farm homestead possible enough\r\nwater must be available, first of all, to supply the culinary needs\r\nof the household. This of itself is not large and, as will be shown\r\nhereafter, may in most cases be obtained. However, in order that the\r\nfamily may possess proper comforts, there should be around the\r\nhomestead trees, and shrubs, and grasses, and the family garden. To\r\nsecure these things a certain amount of irrigation water is\r\nrequired. It may be added that dry-farms on which such homesteads\r\nare found as a result of the existence of a small supply of\r\nirrigation water are much more valuable, in case of sale, than\r\nequally good farms without the possibility of maintaining\r\nhomesteads. Moreover, the distinct value of irrigation in producing\r\na large acre yield makes it desirable for the farmer to use all the\r\nwater at his disposal for irrigation purposes. No available water\r\nshould be allowed to flow away unused.\r\n\r\nAvailable surface water\r\n\r\nThe sources of water for dry-farms fall readily into classes:\r\nsurface waters and subterranean waters. The surface waters, wherever\r\nthey may be obtained, are generally the most profitable. The\r\nsimplest method of obtaining water in an irrigated region is from\r\nsome irrigation canal. In certain districts of the intermountain\r\nregion where the dry farms lie above the irrigation canals and the\r\nirrigated lands below, it is comparatively easy for the farmers to\r\nsecure a small but sufficient amount of water from the canal by the\r\nuse of some pumping device that will force the water through the\r\npipes to the homestead. The dry-farm area that may be so supplied by\r\nirrigation canals is, however, very limited and is not to be\r\nconsidered seriously in connection with the problem.\r\n\r\nA much more important method, especially in the mountainous\r\ndistricts, is the utilization of the springs that occur in great\r\nnumbers over the whole dry-farm territory. Sometimes these springs\r\nare very small indeed, and often, after development by tunneling\r\ninto the side of the hill, yield only a trifling flow. Yet, when\r\nthis water is piped to the homestead and allowed to accumulate in\r\nsmall reservoirs or cisterns, it may be amply sufficient for the\r\nneeds of the family and the live stock, besides having a surplus for\r\nthe maintenance of the lawn, the shade trees, and the family garden.\r\nMany dry-farmers in the intermountain country have piped water seven\r\nor eight miles from small springs that were considered practically\r\nworthless and thereby have formed the foundations for small village\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nOf perhaps equal importance with the utilization of the naturally\r\noccurring springs is the proper conservation of the flood waters. As\r\nhas been stated before, arid conditions allow a very large loss of\r\nthe natural precipitation as run-off. The numerous gullies that\r\ncharacterize so many parts of the dry-farm territory are evidences\r\nof the number and vigor of the flood waters. The construction of\r\nsmall reservoirs in proper places for the purpose of catching the\r\nflood waters will usually enable the farmer to supply himself with\r\nall the water needed for the homestead. Such reservoirs may already\r\nbe found in great numbers scattered over the whole western America.\r\nAs dry-farming increases their numbers will also increase.\r\n\r\nWhen neither canals, nor springs, nor flood waters are available for\r\nthe supply of water, it is yet possible to obtain a limited supply\r\nby so arranging the roof gutters on the farm buildings that all the\r\nwater that falls on the roofs is conducted through the spouts into\r\ncarefully protected cisterns or reservoirs. A house thirty by thirty\r\nfeet, the roof of which is so constructed that all that water that\r\nfalls upon it is carried into a cistern will yield annually under a\r\na rainfall of fifteen inches a maximum amount of water equivalent to\r\nabout 8800 gallons. Allowing for the unavoidable waste due to\r\nevaporation, this will yield enough to supply a household and some\r\nlive stock with the necessary water. In extreme cases this has been\r\nfound to be a very satisfactory practice, though it is the one to be\r\nresorted to only in case no other method is available.\r\n\r\nIt is indispensable that some reservoir be provided to hold the\r\nsurface water that may be obtained until the time it may be needed.\r\nThe water coming constantly from a spring in summer should be\r\napplied to crops only at certain definite seasons of the year. The\r\nflood waters usually come at a time when plant growth is not active\r\nand irrigation is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall also in many districts comes most largely at seasons of\r\nno or little plant growth. Reservoirs must, therefore, be provided\r\nfor the storing of the water until the periods when it is demanded\r\nby crops. Cement-lined cisterns are quite common, and in many places\r\ncement reservoirs have been found profitable. In other places the\r\noccurrence of impervious clay has made possible the establishment\r\nand construction of cheap reservoirs. The skillful and permanent\r\nconstruction of reservoirs is a very important subject. Reservoir\r\nbuilding should be undertaken only after a careful study of the\r\nprevailing conditions and under the advice of the state or\r\ngovernment officials having such work in charge. In general, the\r\nfirst cost of small reservoirs is usually somewhat high, but in view\r\nof their permanent service and the value of the water to the\r\ndry-farm they pay a very handsome interest on the investment. It is\r\nalways a mistake for the dry-farmer to postpone the construction of\r\na reservoir for the storing of the small quantities of water that he\r\nmay possess, in order to save a little money. Perhaps the greatest\r\nobjection to the use of the reservoirs is not their relatively high\r\ncost, but the fact that since they are usually small and the water\r\nshallow, too large a proportion of the water, even under favorable\r\nconditions, is lost by evaporation. It is ordinarily assumed that\r\none half of the water stored in small reservoirs throughout the year\r\nis lost by direct evaporation.\r\n\r\nAvailable subterranean water\r\n\r\nWhere surface waters are not readily available, the subterranean\r\nwater is of first importance. It is generally known that, underlying\r\nthe earth's surface at various depths, there is a large quantity of\r\nfree water. Those living in humid climates often overestimate the\r\namount of water so held in the earth's crust, and it is probably\r\ntrue that those living in arid regions underestimate the quantity of\r\nwater so found. The fact of the matter seems to be that free water\r\nis found everywhere under the earth's surface. Those familiar with\r\nthe arid West have frequently been surprised by the frequency with\r\nwhich water has been found at comparatively shallow depths in the\r\nmost desert locations. Various estimates have been made as to the\r\nquantity of underlying water. The latest calculation and perhaps the\r\nmost reliable is that made by Fuller, who, after a careful analysis\r\nof the factors involved, concludes that the total free water held in\r\nthe earth's crust is equivalent to a uniform sheet of water over the\r\nentire surface of the earth ninety-six feet in depth. A quantity of\r\nwater thus held would be equivalent to about one hundredth part of\r\nthe whole volume of the ocean. Even though the thickness of the\r\nwater sheet under arid soils is only half this figure there is an\r\namount, if it could be reached, that would make possible the\r\nestablishment of homesteads over the whole dry-farm territory. One\r\nof the main efforts of the day is the determination of the\r\noccurrence of the subterranean waters in the dry-farm territory.\r\n\r\nOrdinary dug wells frequently reach water at comparatively shallow\r\ndepths. Over the cultivated Utah deserts water is often found at a\r\ndepth of twenty-five or thirty feet, though many wells dug to a\r\ndepth of one hundred and seventy-five and two hundred feet have\r\nfailed to reach water. It may be remarked in this connection that\r\neven where the distance to the water is small, the piped well has\r\nbeen found to be superior to the dug well. Usually, water is\r\nobtained in the dry-farm territory by driving pipes to comparatively\r\ngreat depths, ranging from one hundred feet to over one thousand\r\nfeet. At such depths water is nearly always found. Often the\r\ngeological conditions are such as to force the water up above the\r\nsurface as artesian wells, though more often the pressure is simply\r\nsufficient to bring the water within easy pumping distance of the\r\nsurface. In connection with this subject it must be said that many\r\nof the subterranean waters of the dry-farm territory are of a saline\r\ncharacter. The amount of substances held in solution varies largely,\r\nbut frequently is far above the limits of safety for the use of man\r\nor beast or plants. The dry-farmer who secures a well of this type\r\nshould, therefore, be careful to have a proper examination made of\r\nthe constituents of the water before ordinary use is made of it.\r\n\r\nNow, as has been said, the utilization of the subterranean waters of\r\nthe land is one of the living problems of dry-farming. The tracing\r\nout of this layer of water is very difficult to accomplish and\r\ncannot be done by individuals. It is a work that properly belongs to\r\nthe state and national government. The state of Utah, which was the\r\npioneer in appropriating money for dry-farm experiments, also led\r\nthe way in appropriating money for the securing of water for the\r\ndry-farms from subterranean sources. The world has been progressing\r\nin Utah since 1905, and water has been secured in the most\r\nunpromising localities. The most remarkable instance is perhaps the\r\nfinding of water at a depth of about five hundred and fifty feet in\r\nthe unusually dry Dog Valley located some fifteen miles west of\r\nNephi.\r\n\r\nPumping water\r\n\r\nThe use of small quantities of water on the dry-farms carries with\r\nit, in most cases, the use of small pumping plants to store and to\r\ndistribute the water properly. Especially, whenever subterranean\r\nsources of water are used and the water pressure is not sufficient\r\nto throw the water above the ground, pumping must be resorted to.\r\nThe pumping of water for agricultural purposes is not at all new.\r\nAccording to Fortier, two hundred thousand acres of land are\r\nirrigated with water pumped from driven wells in the state of\r\nCalifornia alone. Seven hundred and fifty thousand acres are\r\nirrigated by pumping in the United States, and Mead states that\r\nthere are thirteen million acres of land in India which are\r\nirrigated by water pumped from subterranean sources. The dry-farmer\r\nhas a choice among several sources of power for the operation of his\r\npumping plant. In localities where winds are frequent and of\r\nsufficient strength windmills furnish cheap and effective power,\r\nespecially where the lift is not very great. The gasoline engine is\r\nin a state of considerable perfection and may be used economically\r\nwhere the price of gasoline is reasonable. Engines using crude oil\r\nmay be most desirable in the localities where oil wells have been\r\nfound. As the manufacture of alcohol from the waste products of the\r\nfarms becomes established, the alcohol-burning engine could become a\r\nvery important one. Over nearly the whole of the dry-farm territory\r\ncoal is found in large quantities, and the steam engine fed by coal\r\nis an important factor in the pumping of water for irrigation\r\npurposes. Further, in the mountainous part of the dry-farm territory\r\nwater Power is very abundant. Only the smallest fraction of it has\r\nas yet been harnessed for the generation of the electric current. As\r\nelectric generation increases, it should be comparatively easy for\r\nthe farmer to secure sufficient electric power to run the pump. This\r\nhas already become an established practice in districts where\r\nelectric power is available.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years considerable work has been done to\r\ndetermine the feasibility of raising water for irrigation by\r\npumping. Fortier reports that successful results have been obtained\r\nin Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. He declares that a good type of\r\nwindmill located in a district where the average wind movement is\r\nten miles per hour can lift enough water twenty feet to irrigate\r\nfive acres of land. Wherever the water is near the surface this\r\nshould be easy of accomplishment. Vernon, Lovett, and Scott, who\r\nworked under New Mexico conditions, have reported that crops can be\r\nproduced profitably by the use of water raised to the surface for\r\nirrigation. Fleming and Stoneking, who conducted very careful\r\nexperiments on the subject in New Mexico, found that the cost of\r\nraising through one foot a quantity of water corresponding to a\r\ndepth of one foot over one acre of land varied from a cent and an\r\neighth to nearly twenty-nine cents, with an average of a little more\r\nthan ten cents. This means that the cost of raising enough water to\r\ncover one acre to a depth of one foot through a distance of forty\r\nfeet would average $4.36. This includes not only the cost of the\r\nfuel and supervision of the pump but the actual deterioration of the\r\nplant. Smith investigated the same problem under Arizona conditions\r\nand found that it cost approximately seventeen cents to raise one\r\nacre foot of water to a height of one foot. A very elaborate\r\ninvestigation of this nature was conducted in California by Le Conte\r\nand Tait. They studied a large number of pumping plants in actual\r\noperation under California conditions, and determined that the total\r\ncost of raising one acre foot of water one foot was, for gasoline\r\npower, four cents and upward; for electric power, seven to sixteen\r\ncents, and for steam, four cents and upward. Mead has reported\r\nobservations on seventy-two windmills near Garden City, Kansas,\r\nwhich irrigated from one fourth to seven acres each at a cost of\r\nseventy-five cents to $6 per acre. All in all, these results justify\r\nthe belief that water may be raised profitably by pumping for the\r\npurpose of irrigating crops. When the very great value of a little\r\nwater on a dry-farm is considered, the figures here given do not\r\nseem at all excessive. It must be remarked again that a reservoir of\r\nsome sort is practically indispensable in connection with a pumping\r\nplant if the irrigation water is to be used in the best way.\r\n\r\nThe use of small quantities of water in irrigation\r\n\r\nNow, it is undoubtedly true that the acre cost of water on\r\ndry-farms, where pumping plants or similar devices must be used with\r\nexpensive reservoirs, is much higher than when water is obtained\r\nfrom gravity canals. It is, therefore, important that the costly\r\nwater so obtained be used in the most economical manner. This is\r\ndoubly important in view of the fact that the water supply obtained\r\non dry-farms is always small and insufficient for all that the\r\nfarmer would like to do. Indeed, the profit in storing and pumping\r\nwater rests largely upon the economical application of water to\r\ncrops. This necessitates the statement of one of the first\r\nprinciples of scientific irrigation practices, namely, that the\r\nyield of a crop under irrigation is not proportional to the amount\r\nof water applied in the form of irrigation water. In other words,\r\nthe water stored in the soil by the natural precipitation and the\r\nwater that falls during the spring and summer can either mature a\r\nsmall crop or bring a crop near maturity. A small amount of water\r\nadded in the form of irrigation water at the right time will usually\r\ncomplete the work and produce a well-matured crop of large yield.\r\nIrrigation should only be supplemented to the natural precipitation.\r\nAs more irrigation water is added, the increase in yield becomes\r\nsmaller in proportion to the amount of water employed. This is\r\nclearly shown by the following table, which is taken from some of\r\nthe irrigation experiments carried on at the Utah Station:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of Varying Irrigations on Crop Yields Per Acre\r\n\r\nDepth of Water    Wheat      Corn       Alfalfa   Potatoes   Sugar Beets\r\nApplied (Inches)  (Bushels)  (Bushels)  (Pounds)  (Bushels)  (Tons)\r\n5.0               40                              194        25\r\n7.5               41         65\r\n10.0              41         80                   213        26\r\n15.0              46         78                   253        27\r\n25.0              49         77         10,056    258\r\n35.0              55                    9,142     291        26\r\n50                60         84         13,061\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil was a typical arid soil of great depth and had been so\r\ncultivated as to contain a large quantity of the natural\r\nprecipitation. The first five inches of water added to the\r\nprecipitation already stored in the soil produced forty bushels of\r\nwheat. Doubling this amount of irrigation water produced only\r\nforty-one bushels of wheat. Even with an irrigation of fifty inches,\r\nor ten times that which produced forty bushels, only sixty bushels\r\nof wheat, or an increase of one half, were produced. A similar\r\nvariation may be observed in the case of the other crops. The first\r\nlesson to be drawn from this important principle of irrigation is\r\nthat if the soil be so treated as to contain at planting time the\r\nlargest proportion of the natural precipitation,--that is, if the\r\nordinary methods of dry-farming be employed,--crops will be produced\r\nwith a very small amount of irrigation water. Secondly, it follows\r\nthat it would be a great deal better for the farmer who raises\r\nwheat, for instance, to cover ten acres of land with water to a\r\ndepth of five inches than to cover one acre to a depth of fifty\r\ninches, for in the former case four hundred bushels and in the\r\nsecond sixty bushels of wheat would be produced. The farmer who\r\ndesires to utilize in the most economical manner the small amount of\r\nwater at his disposal must prepare the land according to dry-farm\r\nmethods and then must spread the water at his disposal over a larger\r\narea of land. The land must be plowed in the fall if the conditions\r\npermit, and fallowing should be practiced wherever possible. If the\r\nfarmer does not wish to fallow his family garden he can achieve\r\nequally good results by planting the rows twice as far apart as is\r\nordinarily the case and by bringing the irrigation furrows near the\r\nrows of plants. Then, to make the best use of the water, he must\r\ncarefully cover the irrigation furrow with dry dirt immediately\r\nafter the water has been applied and keep the whole surface well\r\nstirred so that evaporation will be reduced to a minimum. The\r\nbeginning of irrigation wisdom is always the storage of the natural\r\nprecipitation. When that is done correctly, it is really remarkable\r\nhow far a small amount of irrigation water may be made to go.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of water scarcity it is often found profitable to\r\ncarry water to the garden in cement or iron pipes so that no water\r\nmay be lost by seepage or evaporation during the conveyance of the\r\nwater from the reservoir to the garden. It is also often desirable\r\nto convey water to plants through pipes laid under the ground,\r\nperforated at various intervals to allow the water to escape and\r\nsoak into the soil in the neighborhood of the plant roots. All such\r\nrefined methods of irrigation should be carefully investigated by\r\nthe who wants the largest results from his limited water supply.\r\nThough such methods may seem cumbersome and expensive at first, yet\r\nthey will be found, if properly arranged, to be almost automatic in\r\ntheir operation and also very profitable.\r\n\r\nForbes has reported a most interesting experiment dealing with the\r\neconomical use of a small water supply under the long season and\r\nintense water dissipating conditions of Arizona. The source of\r\nsupply was a well, 90 feet deep. A 3 by 14-inch pump cylinder\r\noperated by a 12-foot geared windmill lifted the water into a\r\n5000-gallon storage reservoir standing on a support 18 feet high.\r\nThe water was conveyed from this reservoir through black iron pipes\r\nburied 1 or 2 feet from the trees to be watered. Small holes in the\r\npipe 332 inch in diameter allowed the water to escape at desirable\r\nintervals. This irrigation plant was under expert observation for\r\nconsiderable time, and it was found to furnish sufficient water for\r\ndomestic use for one household, and irrigated in addition 61 olive\r\ntrees, 2 cottonwoods, 8 pepper trees, 1 date palm, 19 pomegranates,\r\n4 grapevines, 1 fig tree, 9 eucalyptus trees, 1 ash, and 13\r\nmiscellancous, making a total of 87 useful trees, mainly\r\nfruit-bearing, and 32 vines and bushes. (See Fig. 95.) If such a\r\nresult can be obtained with a windmill and with water ninety feet\r\nbelow the surface under the arid conditions of Arizona, there should\r\nbe little difficulty in securing sufficient water over the larger\r\nportions of the dry-farm territory to make possible beautiful\r\nhomesteads.\r\n\r\nThe dry-farmer should carefully avoid the temptation to decry\r\nirrigation practices. Irrigation and dry-farming of necessity must\r\ngo hand in hand in the development of the great arid regions of the\r\nworld. Neither can well stand alone in the building of great\r\ncommonwealths on the deserts of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great nations of antiquity lived and prospered in arid and\r\nsemiarid countries. In the more or less rainless regions of China,\r\nMesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, Mexico, and Peru, the greatest cities\r\nand the mightiest peoples flourished in ancient days. Of the great\r\ncivilizations of history only that of Europe has rooted in a humid\r\nclimate. As Hilgard has suggested, history teaches that a high\r\ncivilization goes hand in hand with a soil that thirsts for water.\r\nTo-day, current events point to the arid and semiarid regions as the\r\nchief dependence of our modern civilization.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts it may be inferred that dry-farming is an\r\nancient practice. It is improbable that intelligent men and women\r\ncould live in Mesopotamia, for example, for thousands of years\r\nwithout discovering methods whereby the fertile soils could be made\r\nto produce crops in a small degree at least without irrigation.\r\nTrue, the low development of implements for soil culture makes it\r\nfairly certain that dry-farming in those days was practiced only\r\nwith infinite labor and patience; and that the great ancient nations\r\nfound it much easier to construct great irrigation systems which\r\nwould make crops certain with a minimum of soil tillage, than so\r\nthoroughly to till the soil with imperfect implements as to produce\r\ncertain yields without irrigation. Thus is explained the fact that\r\nthe historians of antiquity speak at length of the wonderful\r\nirrigation systems, but refer to other forms of agriculture in a\r\nmost casual manner. While the absence of agricultural machinery\r\nmakes it very doubtful whether dry-farming was practiced extensively\r\nin olden days, yet there can be little doubt of the high antiquity\r\nof the practice.\r\n\r\nKearney quotes Tunis as an example of the possible extent of\r\ndry-farming in early historical days. Tunis is under an average\r\nrainfall of about nine inches, and there are no evidences of\r\nirrigation having been practiced there, yet at El Djem are the ruins\r\nof an amphitheater large enough to accommodate sixty thousand\r\npersons, and in an area of one hundred square miles there were\r\nfifteen towns and forty-five villages. The country, therefore, must\r\nhave been densely populated. In the seventh century, according to\r\nthe Roman records, there were two million five hundred thousand\r\nacres of olive trees growing in Tunis and cultivated without\r\nirrigation. That these stupendous groves yielded well is indicated\r\nby the statement that, under the Caesar's Tunis was taxed three\r\nhundred thousand gallons of olive oil annually. The production of\r\noil was so great that from one town it was piped to the nearest\r\nshipping port. This historical fact is borne out by the present\r\nrevival of olive culture in Tunis, mentioned in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the primitive peoples of to-day, the Chinese,\r\nHindus, Mexicans, and the American Indians, are cultivating large\r\nareas of land by dry-farm methods, often highly perfected, which\r\nhave been developed generations ago, and have been handed down to\r\nthe present day. Martin relates that the Tarahumari Indians of\r\nnorthern Chihuahua, who are among the most thriving aboriginal\r\ntribes of northern Mexico, till the soil by dry-farm methods and\r\nsucceed in raising annually large quantities of corn and other\r\ncrops. A crop failure among them is very uncommon. The early\r\nAmerican explorers, especially the Catholic fathers, found\r\noccasional tribes in various parts of America cultivating the soil\r\nsuccessfully without irrigation. All this points to the high\r\nantiquity of agriculture without irrigation in arid and semiarid\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nModern dry-farming in the United States\r\n\r\nThe honor of having originated modern dry-farming belongs to the\r\npeople of Utah. On July 24th, 1847, Brigham Young with his band of\r\npioneers entered Great Salt Lake Valley, and on that day ground was\r\nplowed, potatoes planted, and a tiny stream of water led from City\r\nCreek to cover this first farm. The early endeavors of the Utah\r\npioneers were devoted almost wholly to the construction of\r\nirrigation systems. The parched desert ground appeared so different\r\nfrom the moist soils of Illinois and Iowa, which the pioneers had\r\ncultivated, as to make it seem impossible to produce crops without\r\nirrigation. Still, as time wore on, inquiring minds considered the\r\npossibility of growing crops without irrigation; and occasionally\r\nwhen a farmer was deprived of his supply of irrigation water through\r\nthe breaking of a canal or reservoir it was noticed by the community\r\nthat in spite of the intense heat the plants grew and produced small\r\nyields.\r\n\r\nGradually the conviction grew upon the Utah pioneers that farming\r\nwithout irrigation was not an impossibility; but the small\r\npopulation were kept so busy with their small irrigated farms that\r\nno serious attempts at dry-farming were made during the first seven\r\nor eight years. The publications of those days indicate that\r\ndry-farming must have been practiced occasionally as early as 1854\r\nor 1855.\r\n\r\nAbout 1863 the first dry-farm experiment of any consequence occurred\r\nin Utah. A number of emigrants of Scandinavian descent had settled\r\nin what is now known as Bear River City, and had turned upon their\r\nfarms the alkali water of Malad Creek, and naturally the crops\r\nfailed. In desperation the starving settlers plowed up the sagebrush\r\nland, planted grain, and awaited results. To their surprise, fair\r\nyields of grain were obtained, and since that day dry-farming has\r\nbeen an established practice in that portion of the Great Salt Lake\r\nValley. A year or two later, Christopher Layton, a pioneer who\r\nhelped to build both Utah and Arizona, plowed up land on the famous\r\nSand Ridge between Salt Lake City and Ogden and demonstrated that\r\ndry-farm wheat could be grown successfully on the deep sandy soil\r\nwhich the pioneers had held to be worthless for agricultural\r\npurposes. Since that day the Sand Ridge has been famous as a\r\ndry-farm district, and Major J. W. Powell, who saw the ripened\r\nfields of grain in the hot dry sand, was moved upon to make special\r\nmention of them in his volume on the \"Arid Lands of Utah,\" published\r\nin 1879.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, perhaps a year or two later, Joshua Salisbury and\r\nGeorge L. Farrell began dry-farm experiments in the famous Cache\r\nValley, one hundred miles north of Salt Lake City. After some years\r\nof experimentation, with numerous failures these and other pioneers\r\nestablished the practice of dry-farming in Cache Valley, which at\r\npresent is one of the most famous dry-farm sections in the United\r\nStates. In Tooele County, Just south of Salt Lake City, dry-farming\r\nwas practiced in 1877--how much earlier is not known. In the\r\nnorthern Utah counties dry-farming assumed proportions of\r\nconsequence only in the later '70's and early '80's. During the\r\n'80's it became a thoroughly established and extensive business\r\npractice in the northern part of the state.\r\n\r\nCalifornia, which was settled soon after Utah, began dry-farm\r\nexperiments a little later than Utah. The available information\r\nindicates that the first farming without irrigation in California\r\nbegan in the districts of somewhat high precipitation. As the\r\npopulation increased, the practice was pushed away from the\r\nmountains towards the regions of more limited rainfall. According to\r\nHilgard, successful dry-farming on an extensive scale has been\r\npracticed in California since about 1868. Olin reports that\r\nmoisture-saving methods were used on the Californian farms as early\r\nas 1861. Certainly, California was a close second in originating\r\ndry-farming.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia Basin was settled by Mareus Whitman near Walla Walla in\r\n1836, but farming did not gain much headway until the railroad\r\npushed through the great Northwest about 1880. Those familiar with\r\nthe history of the state of Washington declare that dry-farming was\r\nin successful operation in isolated districts in the late '70's. By\r\n1890 it was a well-established practice, but received a serious\r\nsetback by the financial panic of 1892-1893. Really successful and\r\nextensive dry-farming in the Columbia Basin began about 1897. The\r\npractice of summer fallow had begun a year or two before. It is\r\ninteresting to note that both in California and Washington there are\r\ndistricts in which dry-farming has been practiced successfully under\r\na precipitation of about ten inches whereas in Utah the limit has\r\nbeen more nearly twelve inches.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Plains area the history of dry-farming Is hopelessly\r\nlost in the greater history of the development of the eastern and\r\nmore humid parts of that section of the country. The great influx of\r\nsettlers on the western slope of the Great Plains area occurred in\r\nthe early '80's and overflowed into eastern Colorado and Wyoming a\r\nfew years later. The settlers of this region brought with them the\r\nmethods of humid agriculture and because of the relatively high\r\nprecipitation were not forced into the careful methods of moisture\r\nconservation that had been forced upon Utah, California, and the\r\nColumbia Basin. Consequently, more failures in dry-farming are\r\nreported from those early days in the Great Plains area than from\r\nthe drier sections of the far West Dry-farming was practiced very\r\nsuccessfully in the Great Plains area during the later '80's.\r\nAccording to Payne, the crops of 1889 were very good; in 1890, less\r\nso; in 1891, better; in 1892 such immense crops were raised that the\r\nsettlers spoke of the section as God's country; in 1893, there was a\r\npartial failure, and in 1894 the famous complete failure, which was\r\nfollowed in 1895 by a partial failure. Since that time fair crops\r\nhave been produced annually. The dry years of 1893-1895 drove most\r\nof the discouraged settlers back to humid sections and delayed, by\r\nmany years, the settlement and development of the western side of\r\nthe Great Plains area. That these failures and discouragements were\r\ndue almost entirely to improper methods of soil culture is very\r\nevident to the present day student of dry-farming. In fact, from the\r\nvery heart of the section which was abandoned in 1893-1895 come\r\nreliable records, dating back to 1886, which show successful crop\r\nproduction every year. The famous Indian Head experimental farm of\r\nSaskatchewan, at the north end of the Great Plains area, has an\r\nunbroken record of good crop yields from 1888, and the early '90's\r\nwere quite as dry there as farther south. However, in spite of the\r\nvicissitudes of the section, dry-farming has taken a firm hold upon\r\nthe Great Plains area and is now a well-established practice.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing about the development of dry-farming in Utah,\r\nCalifornia, Washington, and the Great Plains is that these four\r\nsections appear to have originated dry-farming independently of each\r\nother. True, there was considerable communication from 1849 onward\r\nbetween Utah and California, and there is a possibility that some of\r\nthe many Utah settlers who located in California brought with them\r\naccounts of the methods of dry-farming as practiced in Utah. This,\r\nhowever, cannot be authenticated. It is very unlikely that the\r\nfarmers of Washington learned dry-farming from their California or\r\nUtah neighbors, for until 1880 communication between Washington and\r\nthe colonies in California and Utah was very difficult, though, of\r\ncourse, there was always the possibility of accounts of agricultural\r\nmethods being carried from place to place by the moving emigrants.\r\nIt is fairly certain that the Great Plains area did not draw upon\r\nthe far West for dry-farm methods. The climatic conditions are\r\nconsiderably different and the Great Plains people always considered\r\nthemselves as living in a very humid country as compared with the\r\nstates of the far West. It may be concluded, therefore, that there\r\nwere four independent pioneers in dry-farming in United States.\r\nMoreover, hundreds, probably thousands, of individual farmers over\r\nthe semiarid region have practiced dry-farming thirty to fifty years\r\nwith methods by themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough these different dry-farm sections were developed\r\nindependently, yet the methods which they have finally adopted are\r\npractically identical and include deep plowing, unless the subsoil\r\nis very lifeless; fall plowing; the planting of fall grain wherever\r\nfall plowing is possible; and clean summer fallowing. About 1895 the\r\nword began to pass from mouth to mouth that probably nearly all the\r\nlands in the great arid and semiarid sections of the United States\r\ncould be made to produce profitable crops without irrigation. At\r\nfirst it was merely a whisper; then it was talked aloud, and before\r\nlong became the great topic of conversation among the thousands who\r\nlove the West and wish for its development. Soon it became a\r\nNational subject of discussion. Immediately after the close of the\r\nnineteenth century the new awakening had been accomplished and\r\ndry-farming was moving onward to conquer the waste places of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nH. W. Campbell\r\n\r\nThe history of the new awakening in dry-farming cannot well be\r\nwritten without a brief account of the work of H. W. Campbell who,\r\nin the public mind, has become intimately identified with the\r\ndry-farm movement. H. W. Campbell came from Vermont to northern\r\nSouth Dakota in 1879, where in 1882 he harvested a banner\r\ncrop,--twelve thousand bushels of wheat from three hundred acres. In\r\n1883, on the same farm he failed completely. This experience led him\r\nto a study of the conditions under which wheat and other crops may\r\nbe produced in the Great Plains area. A natural love for\r\ninvestigation and a dogged persistence have led him to give his life\r\nto a study of the agricultural problems of the Great Plains area. He\r\nadmits that his direct inspiration came from the work of Jethro\r\nTull, who labored two hundred years ago, and his disciples. He\r\nconceived early the idea that if the soil were packed near the\r\nbottom of the plow furrow, the moisture would be retained better and\r\ngreater crop certainty would result. For this purpose the first\r\nsubsurface packer was invented in 1885. Later, about 1895, when his\r\nideas had crystallized into theories, he appeared as the publisher\r\nof Campbell's \"Soil Culture and Farm Journal.\" One page of each\r\nissue was devoted to a succinct statement of the \"Campbell Method.\"\r\nIt was in 1898 that the doctrine of summer tillage was begun to be\r\ninvestigated by him.\r\n\r\nIn view of the crop failures of the early '90's and the gradual\r\ndry-farm awakening of the later '90's, Campbell's work was received\r\nwith much interest. He soon became identified with the efforts of\r\nthe railroads to maintain demonstration farms for the benefit of\r\nintending settlers. While Campbell has long been in the service of\r\nthe railroads of the semiarid region, yet it should be said in all\r\nfairness that the railroads and Mr. Campbell have had for their\r\nprimary object the determination of methods whereby the farmers\r\ncould be made sure of successful crops.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell's doctrines of soil culture, based on his accumulated\r\nexperience, are presented in Campbell's \"Soil Culture Manual,\" the\r\nfirst edition of which appeared about 1904 and the latest edition,\r\nconsiderably extended, was published in 1907. The 1907 manual is the\r\nlatest official word by Mr. Campbell on the principles and methods\r\nof the \"Campbell system.\" The essential features of the system may\r\nbe summarized as follows: The storage of water in the soil is\r\nimperative for the production of crops in dry years. This may be\r\naccomplished by proper tillage. Disk the land immediately after\r\nharvest; follow as soon as possible with the plow; follow the plow\r\nwith the subsurface packer; and follow the packer with the smoothing\r\nharrow. Disk the land again as early as possible in the spring and\r\nstir the soil deeply and carefully after every rain. Sow thinly in\r\nthe fall with a drill. If the grain is too thick in the spring,\r\nharrow it out. To make sure of a crop, the land should be \"summer\r\ntilled,\" which means that clean summer fallow should be practiced\r\nevery other year, or as often as may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThese methods, with the exception of the subsurface packing, are\r\nsound and in harmony with the experience of the great dry-farm\r\nsections and with the principles that are being developed by\r\nscientific investigation. The \"Campbell system\" as it stands to-day\r\nis not the system first advocated by him. For instance, in the\r\nbeginning of his work he advocated sowing grain in April and in rows\r\nso far apart that spring tooth harrows could be used for cultivating\r\nbetween the rows. This method, though successful in conserving\r\nmoisture, is too expensive and is therefore superseded by the\r\npresent methods. Moreover, his farm paper of 1896, containing a full\r\nstatement of the \"Campbell method,\" makes absolutely no mention of\r\n\"summer tillage,\" which is now the very keystone of the system.\r\nThese and other facts make it evident that Mr. Campbell has very\r\nproperly modified his methods to harmonize with the best experience,\r\nbut also invalidate the claim that he is the author of the dry-farm\r\nsystem. A weakness of the \"Campbell system\" is the continual\r\ninsistence upon the use of the subsurface packer. As has already\r\nbeen shown, subsurface packing is of questionable value for\r\nsuccessful crop production, and if valuable, the results may be much\r\nmore easily and successfully obtained by the use of the disk and\r\nharrow and other similar implements now on the market. Perhaps the\r\none great weakness in the work of Campbell is that he has not\r\nexplained the principles underlying his practices. His publications\r\nonly hint at the reasons. H. W. Campbell, however, has done much to\r\npopularize the subject of dry-farming and to prepare the way for\r\nothers. His persistence in his work of gathering facts, writing, and\r\nspeaking has done much to awaken interest in dry-farming. He has\r\nbeen as \"a voice in the wilderness\" who has done much to make\r\npossible the later and more systematic study of dry-farming. High\r\nhonor should be shown him for his faith in the semiarid region, for\r\nhis keen observation, and his persistence in the face of\r\ndifficulties. He is justly entitled to be ranked as one of the great\r\nworkers in behalf of the reclamation, without irrigation, of the\r\nrainless sections of the world.\r\n\r\nThe experiment stations\r\n\r\nThe brave pioneers who fought the relentless dryness of the Great\r\nAmerican Desert from the memorable entrance of the Mormon pioneers\r\ninto the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847 were not the only\r\nones engaged in preparing the way for the present day of great\r\nagricultural endeavor. Other, though perhaps more indirect, forces\r\nwere also at work for the future development of the semiarid\r\nsection. The Morrill Bill of 1862, making it possible for\r\nagricultural colleges to be created in the various states and\r\nterritories, indicated the beginning of a public feeling that modern\r\nmethods should be applied to the work of the farm. The passage in\r\n1887 of the Hatch Act, creating agricultural experiment stations in\r\nall of the states and territories, finally initiated a new\r\nagricultural era in the United States. With the passage of this\r\nbill, stations for the application of modern science to crop\r\nproduction were for the first time authorized in the regions of\r\nlimited rainfall, with the exception of the station connected with\r\nthe University of California, where Hilgard from 1872 had been\r\nlaboring in the face of great difficulties upon the agricultural\r\nproblems of the state of California. During the first few years of\r\ntheir existence, the stations were busy finding men and problems.\r\nThe problems nearest at hand were those that had been attacked by\r\nthe older stations founded under an abundant rainfall and which\r\ncould not be of vital interest to arid countries. The western\r\nstations soon began to attack their more immediate problems, and it\r\nwas not long before the question of producing crops without\r\nirrigation on the great unirrigated stretches of the West was\r\ndiscussed among the station staffs and plans were projected for a\r\nstudy of the methods of conquering the desert.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado Station was the first to declare its good intentions in\r\nthe matter of dry-farming, by inaugurating definite experiments. By\r\nthe action of the State Legislature of 1893, during the time of the\r\ngreat drouth, a substation was established at Cheyenne Wells, near\r\nthe west border of the state and within the foothills of the Great\r\nPlains area. From the summer of 1894 until 1900 experiments were\r\nconducted on this farm. The experiments were not based upon any\r\ndefinite theory of reclamation, and consequently the work consisted\r\nlargely of the comparison of varieties, when soil treatment was the\r\nall-important problem to be investigated. True in 1898, a trial of\r\nthe \"Campbell method\" was undertaken. By the time this Station had\r\npassed its pioneer period and was ready to enter upon more\r\nsystematic investigation, it was closed. Bulletin 59 of the Colorado\r\nStation, published in 1900 by J. E. Payne, gives a summary of\r\nobservations made on the Cheyenne Wells substation during seven\r\nyears. This bulletin is the first to deal primarily with the\r\nexperimental work relating to dry-farming in the Great Plains area.\r\nIt does not propose or outline any system of reclamation. Several\r\nlater publications of the Colorado Station deal with the problems\r\npeculiar to the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nAt the Utah Station the possible conquest of the sagebrush deserts\r\nof the Great Basin without irrigation was a topic of common\r\nconversation during the years 1894 and 1895. In 1896 plans were\r\npresented for experiments on the principles of dry-farming. Four\r\nyears later these plans were carried into effect. In the summer of\r\n1901, the author and L. A. Merrill investigated carefully the\r\npractices of the dry-farms of the state. On the basis of these\r\nobservations and by the use of the established principles of the\r\nrelation of water to soils and plants, a theory of dry-farming was\r\nworked out which was published in Bulletin 75 of the Utah Station in\r\nJanuary, 1902. This is probably the first systematic presentation of\r\nthe principles of dry-farming. A year later the Legislature of the\r\nstate of Utah made provision for the establishment and maintenance\r\nof six experimental dry-farms to investigate in different parts of\r\nthe state the possibility of dry-farming and the principles\r\nunderlying the art. These stations, which are still maintained, have\r\ndone much to stimulate the growth of dry-farming in Utah. The credit\r\nof first undertaking and maintaining systematic experimental work in\r\nbehalf of dry-farming should be assigned to the state of Utah. Since\r\ndry-farm experiments began in Utah in 1901, the subject has been a\r\nleading one in the Station and the College. A large number of men\r\ntrained at the Utah Station and College have gone out as\r\ninvestigators of dry-farming under state and Federal direction.\r\n\r\nThe other experiment stations in the arid and semi-arid region were\r\nnot slow to take up the work for their respective states. Fortier\r\nand Linfield, who had spent a number of years in Utah and had become\r\nsomewhat familiar with the dry-farm practices of that state,\r\ninitiated dry-farm investigations in Montana, which have been\r\nprosecuted with great vigor since that time. Vernon, under the\r\ndirection of Foster, who had spent four years in Utah as Director of\r\nthe Utah Station, initiated the work in New Mexico. In Wyoming the\r\nexperimental study of dry-farm lands began by the private enterprise\r\nof H. B. Henderson and his associates. Later V. T. Cooke was placed\r\nin charge of the work under state auspices, and the demonstration of\r\nthe feasibility of dry-farming in Wyoming has been going on since\r\nabout 1907. Idaho has also recently undertaken dry-farm\r\ninvestigations. Nevada, once looked upon as the only state in the\r\nUnion incapable of producing crops without irrigation, is\r\ndemonstrating by means of state appropriations that large areas\r\nthere are suitable for dry-farming. In Arizona, small tracts in this\r\nsun-baked state are shown to be suitable for dry-farm lands. The\r\nWashington Station is investigating the problems of dry-farming\r\npeculiar to the Columbia Basin, and the staff of the Oregon Station\r\nis carrying on similar work. In Nebraska, some very important\r\nexperiments dry-farming are being conducted. In North Dakota there\r\nwere in 1910 twenty-one dry-farm demonstration farms. In South\r\nDakota, Kansas, and Texas, provisions are similarly made for\r\ndry-farm investigations. In fact, up and down the Great Plains area\r\nthere are stations maintained by the state or Federal government for\r\nthe purpose of determining the methods under which crops can be\r\nproduced without irrigation.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Great Plains area at Saskatchewan one of the\r\noldest dry-farm stations in America is located (since 1888). In\r\nRussia several stations are devoted very largely to the problems of\r\ndry land agriculture. To be especially mentioned for the excellence\r\nof the work done are the stations at Odessa, Cherson, and Poltava.\r\nThis last-named Station has been established since 1886.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the work done by the experiment stations should\r\nbe mentioned the assistance given by the railroads. Many of the\r\nrailroads owning land along their respective lines are greatly\r\nbenefited in the selling of these lands by a knowledge of the\r\nmethods whereby the lands may be made productive. However, the\r\nrailroads depend chiefly for their success upon the increased\r\nprosperity of the population along their lines and for the purpose\r\nof assisting the settlers in the arid West considerable sums have\r\nbeen expended by the railroads in cooperation with the stations for\r\nthe gathering of information of value in the reclamation of arid\r\nlands without irrigation.\r\n\r\nIt is through the efforts of the experiment stations that the\r\nknowledge of the day has been reduced to a science of dry-farming.\r\nEvery student of the subject admits that much is yet to be learned\r\nbefore the last word has been said concerning the methods of\r\ndry-farming in reclaiming the waste places of the earth. The future\r\nof dry-farming rests almost wholly upon the energy and intelligence\r\nwith which the experiment stations in this and other countries of\r\nthe world shall attack the special problems connected with this\r\nbranch of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Agriculture of the United States was given a\r\nsecretaryship in the President's Cabinet in 1889. With this added\r\ndignity, new life was given to the department. Under the direction\r\nof J. Sterling Morton preliminary work of great importance was done.\r\nUpon the appointment of James Wilson as Secretary of Agriculture,\r\nthe department fairly leaped into a fullness of organization for the\r\ninvestigation of the agricultural problems of the country. From the\r\nbeginning of its new growth the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture has given some thought to the special problems of the\r\nsemiarid region, especially that part within the Great Plains.\r\nLittle consideration was at first given to the far West. The first\r\nmethod adopted to assist the farmers of the plains was to find\r\nplants with drouth resistant properties. For that purpose explorers\r\nwere sent over the earth, who returned with great numbers of new\r\nplants or varieties of old plants, some of which, such as the durum\r\nwheats, have shown themselves of great value in American\r\nagriculture. The Bureaus of Plant Industry, Soils, Weather, and\r\nChemistry have all from the first given considerable attention to\r\nthe problems of the arid region. The Weather Bureau, long\r\nestablished and with perfected methods, has been invaluable in\r\nguiding investigators into regions where experiments could be\r\nundertaken with some hope of success. The Department of Agriculture\r\nwas somewhat slow, however, in recognizing dry-farming as a system\r\nof agriculture requiring special investigation. The final\r\nrecognition of the subject came with the appointment, in 1905, of\r\nChilcott as expert in charge of dry-land investigations. At the\r\npresent time an office of dry-land investigations has been\r\nestablished under the Bureau of Plant Industry, which cooperates\r\nwith a number of other divisions of the Bureau in the investigation\r\nof the conditions and methods of dry-farming. A large number of\r\nstations are maintained by the Department over the arid and semiarid\r\narea for the purpose of studying special problems, many of which are\r\nmaintained in connection with the state experiment stations. Nearly\r\nall the departmental experts engaged in dry-farm investigation have\r\nbeen drawn from the service of the state stations and in these\r\nstations had received their special training for their work. The\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture has chosen to adopt a strong\r\nconservatism in the matter of dry-farming. It may be wise for the\r\nDepartment, as the official head of the agricultural interests of\r\nthe country, to use extreme care in advocating the settlement of a\r\nregion in which, in the past, farmers had failed to make a living,\r\nyet this conservatism has tended to hinder the advancement of\r\ndry-farming and has placed the departmental investigations of\r\ndry-farming in point of time behind the pioneer investigations of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe Dry-farming Congress\r\n\r\nAs the great dry-farm wave swept over the country, the need was felt\r\non the part of experts and laymen of some means whereby dry-farm\r\nideas from all parts of the country could be exchanged. Private\r\nindividuals by the thousands and numerous state and governmental\r\nstations were working separately and seldom had a chance of\r\ncomparing notes and discussing problems. A need was felt for some\r\ncentral dry-farm organization. An attempt to fill this need was made\r\nby the people of Denver, Colorado, when Governor Jesse F. McDonald\r\nof Colorado issued a call for the first Dry-farming Congress to be\r\nheld in Denver, January 24, 25, and 26, 1907. These dates were those\r\nof the annual stock show which had become a permanent institution of\r\nDenver and, in fact, some of those who were instrumental in the\r\ncalling of the Dry-farming Congress thought that it was a good\r\nscheme to bring more people to the stock show. To the surprise of\r\nmany the Dry-farming Congress became the leading feature of the\r\nweek. Representatives were present from practically all the states\r\ninterested in dry-farming and from some of the humid states. Utah,\r\nthe pioneer dry-farm state, was represented by a delegation second\r\nin size only to that of Colorado, where the Congress was held. The\r\ncall for this Congress was inspired, in part at least, by real\r\nestate men, who saw in the dry-farm movement an opportunity to\r\nrelieve themselves of large areas of cheap land at fairly good\r\nprices. The Congress proved, however, to be a businesslike meeting\r\nwhich took hold of the questions in earnest, and from the very first\r\nmade it clear that the real estate agent was not a welcome member\r\nunless he came with perfectly honest methods.\r\n\r\nThe second Dry-farming Congress was held January 22 to 25, 1908, in\r\nSalt Lake City, Utah, under the presidency of Fisher Harris. It was\r\neven better attended than the first. The proceedings show that it\r\nwas a Congress at which the dry-farm experts of the country stated\r\ntheir findings. A large exhibit of dry-farm products was held in\r\nconnection with this Congress, where ocular demonstrations of the\r\npossibility of dry-farming were given any doubting Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe third Dry-farming Congress was held February 23 to 25, 1909, at\r\nCheyenne, Wyoming, under the presidency of Governor W. W. Brooks of\r\nWyoming. An unusually severe snowstorm preceded the Congress, which\r\nprevented many from attending, yet the number present exceeded that\r\nat any of the preceding Congresses. This Congress was made notable\r\nby the number of foreign delegates who had been sent by their\r\nrespective countries to investigate the methods pursued in America\r\nfor the reclamation of the arid districts. Among these delegates\r\nwere representatives from Canada, Australia, The Transvaal, Brazil,\r\nand Russia.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Congress was held October 26 to 28, 1909, in Billings,\r\nMontana, under the presidency of Governor Edwin L. Morris of\r\nMontana. The uncertain weather of the winter months had led the\r\nprevious Congress to adopt a time in the autumn as the date of the\r\nannual meeting. This Congress became a session at which many of the\r\nprinciples discussed during the three preceding Congresses were\r\ncrystallized into definite statements and agreed upon by workers\r\nfrom various parts of the country. A number of foreign\r\nrepresentatives were present again. The problems of the Northwest\r\nand Canada were given special attention. The attendance was larger\r\nthan at any of the preceding Congresses.\r\n\r\nThe fifth Congress will be held under the presidency of Hon. F. W.\r\nMondell of Wyoming at Spokane, Washington, during October, 1910. It\r\npromises to exceed any preceding Congress in attendance and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Dry-farming Congress has made itself one of the most important\r\nfactors in the development of methods for the reclamation of the\r\ndesert. Its published reports are the most valuable publications\r\ndealing with dry-land agriculture. Only simple justice is done when\r\nit is stated that the success of the Dry-farming Congress is due in\r\na large measure to the untiring and intelligent efforts of John T.\r\nBurns, who is the permanent secretary of the Congress, and who was a\r\nmember of the first executive committee.\r\n\r\nNearly all the arid and semiarid states have organized state\r\ndry-farming congresses. The first of these was the Utah Dry-farming\r\nCongress, organized about two months after the first Congress held\r\nin Denver. The president is L. A. Merrill, one of the pioneer\r\ndry-farm investigators of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nJethro Tull (see frontispiece)\r\n\r\nA sketch of the history of dry-farming would be incomplete without a\r\nmention of the life and work of Jethro Tull. The agricultural\r\ndoctrines of this man, interpreted in the light of modern science,\r\nare those which underlie modern dry-farming. Jethro Tull was born in\r\nBerkshire, England, 1674, and died in 1741. He was a lawyer by\r\nprofession, but his health was so poor that he could not practice\r\nhis profession and therefore spent most of his life in the seclusion\r\nof a quiet farm. His life work was done in the face of great\r\nphysical sufferings. In spite of physical infirmities, he produced a\r\nsystem of agriculture which, viewed in the light of our modern\r\nknowledge, is little short of marvelous. The chief inspiration of\r\nhis system came from a visit paid to south of France, where he\r\nobserved \"near Frontignan and Setts, Languedoc\" that the vineyards\r\nwere carefully plowed and tilled in order to produce the largest\r\ncrops of the best grapes. Upon the basis of this observation he\r\ninstituted experiments upon his own farm and finally developed his\r\nsystem, which may be summarized as follows: The amount of seed to be\r\nused should be proportional to the condition of the land, especially\r\nto the moisture that is in it. To make the germination certain, the\r\nseed should be sown by drill methods. Tull, as has already been\r\nobserved, was the inventor of the seed drill which is now a feature\r\nof all modern agriculture. Plowing should be done deeply and\r\nfrequently; two plowings for one crop would do no injury and\r\nfrequently would result in an increased yield. Finally, as the most\r\nimportant principle of the system, the soil should be cultivated\r\ncontinually, the argument being that by continuous cultivation the\r\nfertility of the soil would be increased, the water would be\r\nconserved, and as the soil became more fertile less water would be\r\nused. To accomplish such cultivation, all crops should be placed in\r\nrows rather far apart, so far indeed that a horse carrying a\r\ncultivator could walk between them. The horse-hoeing idea of the\r\nsystem became fundamental and gave the name to his famous book, \"The\r\nHorse Hoeing Husbandry,\" by Jethro Tull, published in parts from\r\n1731 to 1741. Tull held that the soil between the rows was\r\nessentially being fallowed and that the next year the seed could be\r\nplanted between the rows of the preceding year and in that way the\r\nfertility could be maintained almost indefinitely. If this method\r\nwere not followed, half of the soil could lie fallow every other\r\nyear and be subjected to continuous cultivation. Weeds consume water\r\nand fertility and, therefore, fallowing and all the culture must be\r\nperfectly clean. To maintain fertility a rotation of crops should be\r\npracticed. Wheat should be the main grain crop; turnips the root\r\ncrop; and alfalfa a very desirable crop.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that these teachings are sound and in harmony\r\nwith the best knowledge of to-day and that they are the very\r\npractices which are now being advocated in all dry-farm sections.\r\nThis is doubly curious because Tull lived in a humid country.\r\nHowever, it may be mentioned that his farm consisted of a very poor\r\nchalk soil, so that the conditions under which he labored were more\r\nnearly those of an arid country than could ordinarily be found in a\r\ncountry of abundant rainfall. While the practices of Jethro Tull\r\nwere in themselves very good and in general can be adopted to-day,\r\nyet his interpretation of the principles involved was wrong. In view\r\nof the limited knowledge of his day, this was only to be expected.\r\nFor instance, he believed so thoroughly in the value of cultivation\r\nof the soil, that he thought it would take the place of all other\r\nmethods of maintaining soil-fertility. In fact, he declared\r\ndistinctly that \"tillage is manure,\" which we are very certain at\r\nthis time is fallacious. Jethro Tull is one of the great\r\ninvestigators of the world. In recognition of the fact that, though\r\nliving two hundred years ago in a humid country, he was able to\r\ndevelop the fundamental practices of soil culture now used in\r\ndry-farming, the honor has been done his memory of placing his\r\nportrait as the frontispiece of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDRY-FARMING IN A NUTSHELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocate the dry-farm in a section with an annual precipitation of\r\nmore than ten inches and, if possible, with small wind movement. One\r\nman with four horses and plenty of machinery cannot handle more than\r\nfrom 160 to 200 acres. Farm fewer acres and farm them better.\r\n\r\nSelect a clay loam soil. Other soils may be equally productive, but\r\nare cultivated properly with somewhat more difficulty.\r\n\r\nMake sure, with the help of the soil auger, that the soil is of\r\nuniform structure to a depth of at least eight feet. If streaks of\r\nloose gravel or layers of hardpan are near the surface, water may be\r\nlost to the plant roots.\r\n\r\nAfter the land has been cleared and broken let it lie fallow with\r\nclean cultivation, for one year. The increase in the first and later\r\ncrops will pay for the waiting.\r\n\r\nAlways plow the land early in the fall, unless abundant experience\r\nshows that fall plowing is an unwise practice in the locality.\r\nAlways plow deeply unless the subsoil is infertile, in which case\r\nplow a little deeper each year until eight or ten inches are reached\r\nPlow at least once for each crop. Spring plowing; if practiced,\r\nshould be done as early as possible in the season.\r\n\r\nFollow the plow, whether in the fall or spring, with the disk and\r\nthat with the smoothing harrow, if crops are to be sown soon\r\nafterward. If the land plowed in the fall is to lie fallow for the\r\nwinter, leave it in the rough condition, except in localities where\r\nthere is little or no snow and the winter temperature is high.\r\n\r\nAlways disk the land in early spring, to prevent evaporation. Follow\r\nthe disk with the harrow. Harrow, or in some other way stir the\r\nsurface of the soil after every rain. If crops are on the land,\r\nharrow as long as the plants will stand it. If hoed crops, like corn\r\nor potatoes, are grown, use the cultivator throughout the season. A\r\ndeep mulch or dry soil should cover the land as far as possible\r\nthroughout the summer. Immediately after harvest disk the soil\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nDestroy weeds as soon as they show themselves. A weedy dry-farm is\r\ndoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nGive the land an occasional rest, that is, a clean summer fallow.\r\nUnder a rainfall of less than fifteen inches, the land should be\r\nsummer fallowed every other year; under an annual rainfall of\r\nfifteen to twenty inches, the summer fallow should occur every third\r\nor fourth year. Where the rainfall comes chiefly in the summer, the\r\nsummer fallow is less important in ordinary years than where the\r\nsummers are dry and the winters wet. Only an absolutely clean fallow\r\nshould be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of dry-farm soils must be maintained. Return the\r\nmanure; plow under green leguminous crops occasionally and practice\r\nrotation. On fertile soils plants mature with the least water.\r\n\r\nSow only by the drill method. Wherever possible use fall varieties\r\nof crops. Plant deeply--three or four inches for grain. Plant early\r\nin the fall, especially if the land has been summer fallowed. Use\r\nonly about one half as much seed as is recommended for\r\nhumid-farming.\r\n\r\nAll the ordinary crops may be grown by dry-farming. Secure seed that\r\nhas been raised on dry-farms. Look out for new varieties, especially\r\nadapted for dry-farming, that may be brought in. Wheat is king in\r\ndry-farming; corn a close second. Turkey wheat promises the best.\r\n\r\nStock the dry-farm with the best modern machinery. Dry-farming is\r\npossible only because of the modern plow, the disk, the drill\r\nseeder, the harvester, the header, and the thresher.\r\n\r\nMake a home on the dry-farm. Store the flood waters in a reservoir;\r\nor pump the underground waters, for irrigating the family garden.\r\nSet out trees, plant flowers, and keep some live stock.\r\n\r\nLearn to understand the reasons back of the principles of\r\ndry-farming, apply the knowledge vigorously, and the crop cannot\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nAlways farm as if a year of drouth were coming.\r\n\r\nMan, by his intelligence, compels the laws of nature to do his\r\nbidding, and thus he achieves joy.\r\n\r\n\"And God blessed them--and God said unto them, Be fruitful and\r\nmultiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR OF DROUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shadow of the Year of Drouth still obscures the hope of many a\r\ndry-farmer. From the magazine page and the public platform the\r\nprophet of evil, thinking himself a friend of humanity, solemnly\r\nwarns against the arid region and dry-farming, for the year of\r\ndrouth, he says, is sure to come again and then will be repeated the\r\ndisasters of 1893-1895. Beware of the year of drouth. Even\r\nsuccessful dry-farmers who have obtained good crops every year for a\r\ngeneration or more are half led to expect a dry year or one so dry\r\nthat crops will fail in spite of all human effort. The question is\r\ncontinually asked, \"Can crop yields reasonably be expected every\r\nyear, through a succession of dry years, under semiarid conditions,\r\nif the best methods of dry-farming be practiced?\" In answering this\r\nquestion, it may be said at the very beginning, that when the year\r\nof drouth is mentioned in connection with dry-farming, sad reference\r\nis always made to the experience on the Great Plains in the early\r\nyears of the '90's. Now the fact of the matter is, that while the\r\nyears of 1893,1894, and 1895 were dry years, the only complete\r\nfailure came in 1894. In spite of the improper methods practiced by\r\nthe settlers, the willing soil failed to yield a crop only one year.\r\nMoreover, it should not be forgotten that hundreds of farmers in the\r\ndriest section during this dry period, who instinctively or\r\notherwise farmed more nearly right, obtained good crops even in\r\n1894. The simple practice of summer fallowing, had it been practiced\r\nthe year before, would have insured satisfactory crops in the driest\r\nyear. Further, the settlers who did not take to their heels upon the\r\narrival of the dry year are still living in large numbers on their\r\nhomesteads and in numerous instances have accumulated comfortable\r\nfortunes from the land which has been held up so long as a warning\r\nagainst settlement beyond a humid climate. The failure of 1894 was\r\ndue as much to a lack of proper agricultural information and\r\npractice as to the occurrence of a dry year.\r\n\r\nNext, the statement is carelessly made that the recent success in\r\ndry-farming is due to the fact that we are now living in a cycle of\r\nwet years, but that as soon as the cycle of dry years strikes the\r\ncountry dry-farming will vanish as a dismal failure. Then, again,\r\nthe theory is proposed that the climate is permanently changing\r\ntoward wetness or dryness and the past has no meaning in reading the\r\nriddle of the future. It is doubtless true that no man may safely\r\npredict the weather for future generations; yet, so far as human\r\nknowledge goes, there is no perceptible average change in the\r\nclimate from period to period within historical time; neither are\r\nthere protracted dry periods followed by protracted wet periods. The\r\nfact is, dry and wet years alternate. A succession of somewhat wet\r\nyears may alternate with a succession of somewhat dry years, but the\r\naverage precipitation from decade to decade is very nearly the same.\r\nTrue, there will always be a dry year, that is, the driest year of a\r\nseries of years, and this is the supposedly fearful and fateful year\r\nof drouth. The business of the dry-farmer is always to farm so as to\r\nbe prepared for this driest year whenever it comes. If this be done,\r\nthe farmer will always have a crop: in the wet years his crop will\r\nbe large; in the driest year it will be sufficient to sustain him.\r\n\r\nSo persistent is the half-expressed fear that this driest year makes\r\nit impossible to rely upon dry-farming as a permanent system of\r\nagriculture that a search has been made for reliable long records of\r\nthe production of crops in arid and semiarid regions. Public\r\nstatements have been made by many perfectly reliable men to the\r\neffect that crops have been produced in diverse sections over long\r\nperiods of years, some as long as thirty-five or forty year's,\r\nwithout one failure having occurred. Most of these statements,\r\nhowever, have been general in their nature and not accompanied by\r\nthe exact yields from year to year. Only three satisfactory records\r\nhave been found in a somewhat careful search. Others no doubt exist.\r\n\r\nThe first record was made by Senator J. G. M. Barnes of Kaysville,\r\nUtah. Kaysville is located in the Great Salt Lake Valley, about\r\nfifteen miles north of Salt Lake City. The climate is semiarid; the\r\nprecipitation comes mainly in the winter and early spring; the\r\nsummers are dry, and the evaporation is large. Senator Barnes\r\npurchased ninety acres of land in the spring of 1887 and had it\r\nfarmed under his own supervision until 1906. He is engaged in\r\ncommercial enterprises and did not, himself, do any of the work on\r\nthe farm, but employed men to do the necessary labor. However, he\r\nkept a close supervision of the farm and decided upon the practices\r\nwhich should be followed. From seventy-eight to eighty-nine acres\r\nwere harvested for each crop, with the exception of 1902, when all\r\nbut about twenty acres was fired by sparks from the passing railroad\r\ntrain. The plowing, harrowing, and weeding were done very carefully.\r\nThe complete record of the Barnes dry-farm from 1887 to 1905 is\r\nshown in the table on the following page.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord of the Barnes Dry-farm, Salt Lake Valley, Utah (90 acres)\r\n\r\nYear   Annual    Yield     When    When\r\n      Rainfall  per Acre  Plowed   Sown\r\n      (Inches)   (Bu.)\r\n1887   11.66      ---      May     Sept.\r\n1888   13.62    Failure    May     Sept.\r\n1889   18.46     22.5      ---   Volunteer+\r\n1890   10.38     15.5      ---     ---\r\n1891   15.92    Fallow     May     Fall\r\n1892   14.08     19.3      ---     ---\r\n1893   17.35    Fallow     May     Fall\r\n1894   15.27     26.0      ---     ---\r\n1895   11.95    Fallow     May     Aug.\r\n1896   18.42     22.0      ---     ---\r\n1897   16.74    Fallow    Spring   Fall\r\n1898   16.09     26.0      ---     ---\r\n1899   17.57    Fallow     May     Fall\r\n1900   11.53     23.5      ---     ---\r\n1901   16.08    Fallow    Spring   Fall\r\n1902   11.41     28.9      Sept.

The\r\nfirst sowing was made in the fall of 1887, and fall grain was grown\r\nduring the whole period of observation. The seed sown in the fall of\r\n1887 came up well, but was winter-killed. This is ascribed by\r\nSenator Barnes to the very dry winter, though it is probable that\r\nthe soil was not sufficiently well stored with moisture to carry the\r\ncrop through. The farm was plowed again in the spring of 1888, and\r\nanother crop sown in September of the same year. In the summer of\r\n1889, 22-1/2 bushels of wheat were harvested to the acre. Encouraged\r\nby this good crop Mr. Barnes allowed a volunteer crop to grow that\r\nfall and the next summer harvested as a result 15-1/2 bushels of\r\nwheat to the acre. The table shows that only one crop smaller than\r\nthis was harvested during the whole period of nineteen years,\r\nnamely, in 1903, when the same thing was done, and one crop was made\r\nto follow another without an intervening fallow period. This\r\nobservation is an evidence in favor of clean summer fallowing. The\r\nlargest crop obtained, 28.9 bushels per acre in 1902, was gathered\r\nin a year when the next to the lowest rainfall of the whole period\r\noccurred, namely, 11.41 inches.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation varied during the nineteen years from 10.33 inches\r\nto 18.46 inches. The variation in yield per acre was considerably\r\nless than this, not counting the two crops that were grown\r\nimmediately after another crop. All in all, the unique record of the\r\nBarnes dry-farm shows that through a period of nineteen years,\r\nincluding dry and comparatively wet years, there was absolutely no\r\nsign of failure, except in the first year, when probably the soil\r\nhad not been put in proper condition to support crops. In passing it\r\nmaybe mentioned that, according to the records furnished by Senator\r\nBarnes, the total cost of operating the farm during the nineteen\r\nyears was $4887.69; the total income was $10,144.83. The difference,\r\n$5257.14, is a very fair profit on the investment of $1800--the\r\noriginal cost of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Head farm\r\n\r\nAn equally instructive record is furnished by the experimental farm\r\nlocated at Indian Head in Saskatchewan, Canada, in the northern part\r\nof the Great Plains area. According to Alway, the country is in\r\nappearance very much like western Nebraska and Kansas; the climate\r\nis distinctly arid, and the precipitation comes mainly in the spring\r\nand summer. It is the only experimental dry-farm in the Great Plains\r\narea with records that go back before the dry years of the early\r\n'90's. In 1882 the soil of this farm was broken, and it was farmed\r\ncontinuously until 1888, when it was made an experimental farm under\r\ngovernment supervision. The following table shows the yields\r\nobtained from the year 1891, when the precipitation records were\r\nfirst kept, to 1909:--\r\n\r\nRECORD OF INDIAN HEAD EXPERIMENTAL FARM AND MOTHERWELL'S FARM,\r\nSASKATCHEWAN, CANADA\r\n\r\nYear   Annual    Bushels of Wheat  Bushels of Wheat  Bushels of Wheat\r\n      Rainfall   per Acre          per Acre          per Acre\r\n      (Inches)+  Experimental      Experimental      Motherwell's Farm\r\n                 Farm--Fallow      Farm--Stubble\r\n1891  14.03      35                32                30\r\n1892   6.92      28                21                28\r\n1893  10.11      35                22                34\r\n1894   3.90      17                 9                24\r\n1895  12.28      41                22                26\r\n1896  10.59      39                29                31\r\n1897  14.62      33                26                35\r\n1898  18.03      32                ---               27\r\n1899   9.44      33                ---               33\r\n1900  11.74      17                 5                25\r\n1901  20.22      49                38                51\r\n1902  10.73      38                22                28\r\n1903  15.55      35                15                31\r\n1904  11.96      40                29                35\r\n1905  19.17      42                18                36\r\n1906  13.21      26                13                38\r\n1907  15.03      18                18                15\r\n1908  13.17      29                14                16\r\n1909  13.96      28                15                23\r\n\r\n+Snowfall not included. This has varied from 2.3 to 1.3 inches of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual rainfall shown in the second column does not include the\r\nwater which fell in the form of snow. According to the records at\r\nhand, the annual snow fall varied from 2.3 to 1.3 inches of water,\r\nwhich should be added to the rainfall given in the table. Even with\r\nthis addition the rainfall shows the district to be of a distinctly\r\nsemiarid character. It will be observed that the precipitation\r\nvaried from 3.9 to 20.22 inches, and that during the early '90's\r\nseveral rather dry years occurred. In spite of this large variation\r\ngood crops have been obtained during the whole period of nineteen\r\nyears. Not one failure is recorded. The lowest yield of 17 bushels\r\nper acre came during the very dry year of 1894 and during the\r\nsomewhat dry year of 1900. Some of the largest yields were obtained\r\nin seasons when the rainfall was only near the average. As a record\r\nshowing that the year of drouth need not be feared when dry-farming\r\nis done right, this table is of very high interest. It may be noted,\r\nincidentally, that throughout the whole period wheat following a\r\nfallow always yielded higher than wheat following the stubble. For\r\nthe nineteen years, the difference was as 32.4 bushels is to 20.5\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\nThe Mother well farm\r\n\r\nIn the last column of the table are shown the annual yields of wheat\r\nobtained on the farm of Commissioner Motherwell of the province of\r\nSaskatchewan. This private farm is located some twenty-five miles\r\naway from Indian Head, and the rainfall records of the experimental\r\nfarm are, therefore, only approximately accurate for the Motherwell\r\nfarm. The results on this farm may well be compared to the Barnes\r\nresults of Utah, since they were obtained on a private farm. During\r\nthe period of nineteen years good crops were invariably obtained;\r\neven during the very dry year of 1894, a yield of twenty-four\r\nbushels of wheat to the acre was obtained. Curiously enough, the\r\nlowest yields of fifteen and sixteen bushels to the acre were\r\nobtained in 1907 and 1908 when the precipitation was fairly good,\r\nand must be ascribed to some other factor than that of\r\nprecipitation. The record of this farm shows conclusively that with\r\nproper farming there is no need to fear the year of drouth.\r\n\r\nThe Utah drouth of 1910\r\n\r\nDuring the year of 1910 only 2.7 inches of rain fell in Salt Lake\r\nCity from March 1 to the July harvest, and all of this in March, as\r\nagainst 7.18 inches during the same period the preceding year. In\r\nother parts of the state much less rain fell; in fact, in the\r\nsouthern part of the state the last rain fell during the last week\r\nof December, 1909. The drouth remained unbroken until long after the\r\nwheat harvests. Great fear was expressed that the dry-farms could\r\nnot survive so protracted a period of drouth. Agents, sent out over\r\nthe various dry-farm districts, reported late in June that wherever\r\nclean summer fallowing had been practiced the crops were in\r\nexcellent condition; but that wherever careless methods had been\r\npracticed, the crops were poor or killed. The reports of the harvest\r\nin July of 1910 showed that fully 85 per cent of an average crop was\r\nobtained in spite of the protracted drouth wherever the soil came\r\ninto the spring well stored with moisture, and in many instances\r\nfull crops were obtained.\r\n\r\nOver the whole of the dry-farm territory of the United States\r\nsimilar conditions of drouth occurred. After the harvest, however,\r\nevery state reported that the crops were well up to the average\r\nwherever correct methods of culture had been employed.\r\n\r\nThese well-authenticated records from true semi-arid districts,\r\ncovering the two chief types of winter and summer precipitation,\r\nprove that the year of drouth, or the driest year in a twenty-year\r\nperiod, does not disturb agricultural conditions seriously in\r\nlocalities where the average annual precipitation is not too low,\r\nand where proper cultural methods arc followed. That dry-farming is\r\na system of agricultural practice which requires the application of\r\nhigh skill and intelligence is admitted; that it is precarious is\r\ndenied. The year of drouth is ordinarily the year in which the man\r\nfailed to do properly his share of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT STATUS OF DRY-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to obtain a correct view of the present status of\r\ndry-farming, first, because dry-farm surveys are only beginning to\r\nbe made and, secondly, because the area under dry-farm cultivation\r\nis increasing daily by leaps and bounds. All arid and semiarid parts\r\nof the world are reaching out after methods of soil culture whereby\r\nprofitable crops may be produced without irrigation, and the\r\npractice of dry-farming, according to modern methods, is now\r\nfollowed in many diverse countries. The United States undoubtedly\r\nleads at present in the area actually under dry-farming, but, in\r\nview of the immense dry-farm districts in other parts of the world,\r\nit is doubtful if the United States will always maintain its\r\nsupremacy in dry-farm acreage. The leadership in the development of\r\na science of dry-farming will probably remain with the United States\r\nfor years, since the numerous experiment stations established for\r\nthe study of the problems of farming without irrigation have their\r\nwork well under way, while, with the exception of one or two\r\nstations in Russia and Canada, no other countries have experiment\r\nstations for the study of dry-farming in full operation. The reports\r\nof the Dry-farming Congress furnish practically the only general\r\ninformation as to the status of dry-farming in the states and\r\nterritories of the United States and in the countries of the world.\r\n\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\nIn the state of California dry-farming has been firmly established\r\nfor more than a generation. The chief crop of the California\r\ndry-farms is wheat, though the other grains, root crops, and\r\nvegetables are also grown without irrigation under a comparatively\r\nsmall rainfall. The chief dry-farm areas are found in the Sacramento\r\nand the San Joaquin valleys. In the Sacramento Valley the\r\nprecipitation is fairly large, but in the San Joaquin Valley it is\r\nvery small. Some of the most successful dry-farms of California have\r\nproduced well for a long succession of years under a rainfall of ten\r\ninches and less. California offers a splendid example of the great\r\ndanger that besets all dry-farm sections. For a generation wheat has\r\nbeen produced on the fertile Californian soils without manuring of\r\nany kind. As a consequence, the fertility of the soils has been so\r\nfar depleted that at present it is difficult to obtain paying crops\r\nwithout irrigation on soils that formerly yielded bountifully. The\r\nliving problem of the dry-farms in California is the restoration of\r\nthe fertility which has been removed from the soils by unwise\r\ncropping. All other dry-farm districts should take to heart this\r\nlesson, for, though crops may be produced on fertile soils for one,\r\ntwo, or even three generations without manuring, yet the time will\r\ncome when plant-food must be added to the soil in return for that\r\nwhich has been removed by the crops. Meanwhile, California offers,\r\nalso, an excellent example of the possibility of successful\r\ndry-farming through long periods and under varying climatic\r\nconditions. In the Golden State dry-farming is a fully established\r\npractice; it has long since passed the experimental stage.\r\n\r\nColumbia River Basin\r\n\r\nThe Columbia River Basin includes the state of Washington, most of\r\nOregon, the northern and central part of Idaho, western Montana, and\r\nextends into British Columbia. It includes the section often called\r\nthe Inland Empire, which alone covers some one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand square miles. The chief dry-farm crop of this region is\r\nwheat; in fact, western Washington or the \"Palouse country\" is\r\nfamous for its wheat-producing powers. The other grains, potatoes,\r\nroots, and vegetables are also grown without irrigation. In the\r\nparts of this dry-farm district where the rainfall is the highest,\r\nfruits of many kinds and of a high quality are grown without\r\nirrigation. It is estimated that at least two million acres are\r\nbeing dry-farmed in this district. Dry-farming is fully established\r\nin the Columbia River Basin. One farmer is reported to have raised\r\nin one year on his own farm two hundred and fifty thousand bushels\r\nof wheat. In one section of the district where the rainfall for the\r\nlast few years has been only about ten or eleven inches, wheat has\r\nbeen produced successfully. This corroborates the experience of\r\nCalifornia, that wheat may really be grown in localities where the\r\nannual rainfall is not above ten inches. The most modern methods of\r\ndry-farming are followed by the farmers of the Columbia River Basin,\r\nbut little attention has been given to soil-fertility, since soils\r\nthat have been farmed for a generation still appear to retain their\r\nhigh productive powers. Undoubtedly, however, in this district, as\r\nin California, the question of soil-fertility will be an important\r\none in the near future. This is one of the great dry-farm districts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin includes Nevada, the western half of Utah, a small\r\npart of southern Oregon and Idaho, and also a part of Southern\r\nCalifornia. It is a great interior basin with all its rivers\r\ndraining into salt lakes or dry sinks. In recent geological times\r\nthe Great Basin was filled with water, forming the great Lake\r\nBonneville which drained into the Columbia River. In fact, the Great\r\nBasin is made up of a series of great valleys, with very level\r\nfloors, representing the old lake bottom. On the bench lands are\r\nseen, in many places, the effects of the wave action of the ancient\r\nlake. The chief dry-farm crop of this district is wheat, but the\r\nother grains, including corn, are also produced successfully. Other\r\ncrops have been tried with fair success, but not on a commercial\r\nscale. Grapevines have been made to grow quite successfully without\r\nirrigation on the bench lands. Several small orchards bearing\r\nluscious fruit are growing on the deep soils of the Great Basin\r\nwithout the artificial application of water. Though the first\r\ndry-farming by modern peoples was probably practiced in the Great\r\nBasin, yet the area at present under cultivation is not large,\r\npossibly a little more than four hundred thousand acres.\r\n\r\nDry-farming, however, is well established. There are large areas,\r\nespecially in Nevada, that receive less than ten inches of rainfall\r\nannually, and one of the leading problems before the dry-farmers of\r\nthis district is the determination of the possibility of producing\r\ncrops upon such lands without irrigation. On the older dry-farms,\r\nwhich have existed in some cases from forty to fifty years, there\r\nare no signs of diminution of soil-fertility. Undoubtedly, however,\r\neven under the conditions of extremely high fertility prevailing in\r\nthe Great Basin, the time will soon come when the dry-farmer must\r\nmake provision for restoring to the soil some of the fertility taken\r\naway by crops. There are millions of acres in the Great Basin yet to\r\nbe taken up and subjected to the will of the dry-farmer.\r\n\r\nColorado and Rio Grande River Basins\r\n\r\nThe Colorado and Rio Grande River Basins include Arizona and the\r\nwestern part of New Mexico. The chief dry-farm crops of this dry\r\ndistrict are wheat, corn, and beans. Other crops have also been\r\ngrown in small quantities and with some success. The area suitable\r\nfor dry-farming in this district has not yet been fully determined\r\nand, therefore, the Arizona and New Mexico stations are undertaking\r\ndry-farm surveys of their respective states. In spite of the fact\r\nthat Arizona is generally looked upon as one of the driest states of\r\nthe Union, dry-farming is making considerable headway there. In New\r\nMexico, five sixths of all the homestead applications during the\r\nlast year were for dry-farm lands; and, in fact, there are several\r\nprosperous communities in New Mexico which are subsisting almost\r\nwholly on dry-farming. It is only fair to say, however, that\r\ndry-farming is not yet well established in this district, but that\r\nthe prospects are that the application of scientific principles will\r\nsoon make it possible to produce profitable crops without irrigation\r\nin large parts of the Colorado and Rio Grande River Basins.\r\n\r\nThe mountain states\r\n\r\nThis district includes a part of Montana, nearly the whole of\r\nWyoming and Colorado, and part of eastern Idaho. It is located along\r\nthe backbone of the Rocky Mountains. The farms are located chiefly\r\nin valleys and on large rolling table-lands. The chief dry-farm crop\r\nis wheat, though the other crops which are grown elsewhere on\r\ndry-farms may be grown here also. In Montana there is a very large\r\narea of land which has been demonstrated to be well adapted for\r\ndry-farm purposes. In Wyoming, especially on the eastern as well as\r\non the far western side, dry-farming has been shown to be\r\nsuccessful, but the area covered at the present time is\r\ncomparatively small. In Idaho, dry-farming is fairly well\r\nestablished. In Colorado, likewise, the practice is very well\r\nestablished and the area is tolerably large. All in all, throughout\r\nthe mountain states dry-farming may be said to be well established,\r\nthough there is a great opportunity for the extension of the\r\npractice. The sparse population of the western states naturally\r\nmakes it impossible for more than a small fraction of the land to be\r\nproperly cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains Area\r\n\r\nThis area includes parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota,\r\nNebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and\r\nTexas. It is the largest area of dry-farm land under approximately\r\nuniform conditions. Its drainage is into the Mississippi, and it\r\ncovers an area of not less than four hundred thousand square miles.\r\nDry-farm crops grow well over the whole area; in fact, dry-farming\r\nis well established in this district. In spite of the failures so\r\nwidely advertised during the dry season of 1894, the farmers who\r\nremained on their farms and since that time have employed modern\r\nmethods have secured wealth from their labors. The important\r\nquestion before the farmers of this district is that of methods for\r\nsecuring the best results. From the Dakotas to Texas the farmers\r\nbear the testimony that wherever the soil has been treated right,\r\naccording to approved methods, there have been no crop failures.\r\n\r\nCanada\r\n\r\nDry-farming has been pushed vigorously in the semiarid portions of\r\nCanada, and with great success. Dry-farming is now reclaiming large\r\nareas of formerly worthless land, especially in Alberta,\r\nSaskatchewan, and the adjoining provinces. Dry-farming is\r\ncomparatively recent in Canada, yet here and there are semiarid\r\nlocalities where crops have been raised without irrigation for\r\nupwards of a quarter of a century. In Alberta and other places it\r\nhas been now practiced successfully for eight or ten years, and it\r\nmay be said that dry-farming is a well-established practice in the\r\nsemiarid regions of the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nMexico\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, likewise, dry-farming has been tried and found to be\r\nsuccessful. The natives of Mexico have practiced farming without\r\nirrigation for centuries--and modern methods are now being applied\r\nin the zone midway between the extremely dry and the extremely humid\r\nportions. The irregular distribution of the precipitation, the late\r\nspring and early fall frosts, and the fierce winds combine to make\r\nthe dry-farm problem somewhat difficult, yet the prospects are that,\r\nwith government assistance, dry-farming in the near future will\r\nbecome an established practice in Mexico. In the opinion of the best\r\nstudents of Mexico it is the only method of agriculture that can be\r\nmade to reclaim a very large portion of the country.\r\n\r\nBrazil\r\n\r\nBrazil, which is greater in area than the United States, also has a\r\nlarge arid and semiarid territory which can be reclaimed only by\r\ndry-farm methods. Through the activity of leading citizens\r\nexperiments in behalf of the dry-farm movement have already been\r\nordered. The dry-farm district of Brazil receives an annual\r\nprecipitation of about twenty-five inches, but irregularly\r\ndistributed and under a tropical sun. In the opinion of those who\r\nare familiar with the conditions the methods of dry-farming may be\r\nso adapted as to make dry-farming successful in Brazil.\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\nAustralia, larger than the continental United States, is vitally\r\ninterested in dry-farming, for one third of its vast area is under a\r\nrainfall of less than ten inches, and another third is under a\r\nrainfall of between ten and twenty inches. Two thirds of the area of\r\nAustralia, if reclaimed at all, must be reclaimed by dry-farming.\r\nThe realization of this condition has led several Australians to\r\nvisit the United States for the purpose of learning the methods\r\nemployed in dry-farming. The reports on dry-farming in America by\r\nSurveyor-General Strawbridge and Senator J. H. McColl have done much\r\nto initiate a vigorous propaganda in behalf of dry-farming in\r\nAustralia. Investigation has shown that occasional farmers are found\r\nin Australia, as in America, who have discovered for themselves many\r\nof the methods of dry-farming and have succeeded in producing crops\r\nprofitably. Undoubtedly, in time, Australia will be one of the great\r\ndry-farming countries of the world.\r\n\r\nAfrica\r\n\r\nUp to the present, South Africa only has taken an active interest in\r\nthe dry-farm movement, due to the enthusiastic labors of Dr. William\r\nMacdonald of the Transvaal. The Transvaal has an average annual\r\nprecipitation of twenty-three inches, with a large district that\r\nreceives between thirteen and twenty inches. The rain comes in the\r\nsummer, making the conditions similar to those of the Great Plains.\r\nThe success of dry-farming has already been practically\r\ndemonstrated. The question before the Transvaal farmers is the\r\ndetermination of the best application of water conserving methods\r\nunder the prevailing conditions. Under proper leadership the\r\nTransvaal and other portions of Africa will probably join the ranks\r\nof the larger dry-farming countries of the world.\r\n\r\nRussia\r\n\r\nMore than one fourth of the whole of Russia is so dry as to be\r\nreclaimable only by dry-farming. The arid area of southern European\r\nRussia has a climate very much like that of the Great Plains.\r\nTurkestan and middle Asiatic Russia have a climate more like that of\r\nthe Great Basin. In a great number of localities in both European\r\nand Asiatic Russia dry-farming has been practiced for a number of\r\nyears. The methods employed have not been of the most refined kind,\r\ndue, possibly, to the condition of the people constituting the\r\nfarming class. The government is now becoming interested in the\r\nmatter and there is no doubt that dry-farming will also be practiced\r\non a very large scale in Russia.\r\n\r\nTurkey\r\n\r\nTurkey has also a large area of arid land and, due to American\r\nassistance, experiments in dry-farming are being carried on in\r\nvarious parts of the country. It is interesting to learn that the\r\nexperiments there, up to date, have been eminently successful and\r\nthat the prospects now are that modern dry-farming will soon be\r\nconducted on a large scale in the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nPalestine\r\n\r\nThe whole of Palestine is essentially arid and semi-arid and\r\ndry-farming there has been practiced for centuries. With the\r\napplication of modern methods it should be more successful than ever\r\nbefore. Dr. Aaronsohn states that the original wild wheat from which\r\nthe present varieties of wheat have descended has been discovered to\r\nbe a native of Palestine.\r\n\r\nChina\r\n\r\nChina is also interested in dry-farming. The climate of the drier\r\nportions of China is much like that of the Dakotas. Dry-farming\r\nthere is of high antiquity, though, of course, the methods are not\r\nthose that have been developed in recent years. Under the influence\r\nof the more modern methods dry-farming should spread extensively\r\nthroughout China and become a great source of profit to the empire.\r\nThe results of dry-farming in China are among the best.\r\n\r\nThese countries have been mentioned simply because they have been\r\nrepresented at the recent Dry-farming Congresses. Nearly all of the\r\ngreat countries of the world having extensive semiarid areas are\r\ndirectly interested in dry-farming. The map on pages 30 and 31 shows\r\nthat more than 55 per cent of the world's surface receives an annual\r\nrainfall of less than twenty inches. Dry-farming is a world problem\r\nand as such is being received by the nations.",
