So far as I am aware, however, no\r\nsingle work dealing historically with modern shipbuilding in a way\r\nat once trustworthy and popular, and in a form handy and accessible,\r\nhas yet been published. The present work aims at supplying this want.\r\nIn undertaking it originally, I felt encouraged by the acceptance\r\nwhich various articles, contributed to the columns of the _Glasgow\r\nHerald_, _The Engineer_, _The Steamship_, _Iron_, &c., had met with\r\nfrom many whose good opinion I had reason to value highly. With the\r\nkind permission of the proprietors of the above journals, I have made\r\nuse to some extent of the articles in question—but largely amplified\r\nand corrected—in preparing the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe work is concerned exclusively with shipbuilding for the merchant\r\nmarine, and no attempt is made to trace the progress connected with\r\nnaval shipbuilding, although some of the many important influences\r\nwhich the one exerts upon the other have been indicated. Even as\r\nthus defined and restricted, the field of review is so vast that the\r\nlimits which I had determined should bound the work with respect to\r\nprice, and consequently with respect to size, have compelled me to\r\ntreat briefly and in a general way many matters which it might have\r\nbeen of interest to enlarge upon. The list of authoritative papers\r\nand lectures to which readers can at first hand refer—given at the\r\nend of each chapter—may, it is hoped, compensate to some extent for\r\nthese deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe book being mainly historical, originality in the strict sense\r\nof the term cannot, of course, be urged for much of the contained\r\nmatter; but efforts have been made throughout to present trustworthy\r\nstatements of the very latest steps in advance. This is specially\r\ntrue of the chapter on scientific progress. My object, however,\r\nhaving been more to enlighten general readers than to seek to\r\ninterest or inform professional ones, it is perhaps wanting in the\r\nscientific fulness needed to give it special value, viewed from the\r\nstandpoint of the trained naval architect.\r\n\r\nWhile the biographies and portraits given throughout the book may\r\nbe considered fairly representative of those who as shipbuilders,\r\nshipowners, naval architects, or marine engineers have made\r\ntheir influence felt on the world’s mercantile marine during the\r\nperiod of review, the collection by no means includes all who are\r\ndeserving of such notice. The subjects of portraiture are all in\r\nlife, and actively engaged in their respective spheres of labour.\r\nThe diffidence generally evinced by them in consenting that their\r\nlikenesses and the note of their professional career should be\r\ngiven, has made my task one of difficulty. What may be called the\r\nover-diffidence of a few, originally selected for portraiture, has to\r\nsome extent occasioned the incompleteness now commented upon.\r\n\r\nAs further accounting for the limitations of the present work, I\r\nthink it fitting to add that the preparation of the whole book,\r\nincluding the task of seeing it through the press, has devolved\r\nupon me at a time when the ordinary intervals of respite from daily\r\nbusiness have had to suffice for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nMy best thanks are due to those firms and individuals to whom I had\r\nto appeal for statistics and other particulars, for their generally\r\nready and courteous attention to my requests.\r\n\r\n                                                        DAVID POLLOCK.\r\n\r\nDUMBARTON, _November,

If we\r\n  look at the magnitude of the operations of building, launching,\r\n  engining, and completing a modern passenger ship of the first\r\n  rank, and regard the multiplicity of the arrangements and beauty\r\n  of finish now expected, and then think this structure has to brave\r\n  the elements, make regular passages, convey thousands of human\r\n  souls, and tens of thousands of tons of merchandise every year\r\n  across the ocean, in storm or calm, we cannot but feel that they\r\n  are occupied in useful human labour. But more than this, there\r\n  is a public sentiment surrounding ships that no other mechanical\r\n  structures can command. Beautiful churches, grand buildings, huge\r\n  structures of all kinds have a certain interest pertaining to them,\r\n  but it is different in kind from that which surrounds a ship.\r\n  The former are fixed, immovable, inert; the ship is here to-day\r\n  and gone to-morrow, building up a history from day to day with\r\n  a reputation as sensitive as a woman’s to calumny, and like her\r\n  consequently often a bone of contention as well as an object of\r\n  admiration.”—_William John._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN SHIPBUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nRECENT PROGRESS IN STEAMSHIP CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe achievements in shipbuilding and marine engineering within recent\r\nyears may be said to borrow lustre from one particular feat of past\r\ntimes. The _Great Eastern_ undoubtedly furnished, in large measure,\r\nthe experience that has recently been causing so great a change in\r\nthe tonnage of our mercantile marine. Commercially, as is well known,\r\nthat huge vessel—“Brunel’s grand audacity,” she has been called—has\r\nall along proved a lamentable failure. It has been stated on good\r\nauthority that between 1853—the year in which the contract for her\r\nwas entered into—and the year 1869, no less than one million sterling\r\nhad been lost upon her by the various proprietors attempting to\r\nwork her. Financially, indeed, she may be said to have proved the\r\n“Devastation” of the mercantile marine. Although at various times in\r\nher long life-time she has unquestionably done most useful service in\r\nsub-marine cable-laying—service, indeed, which, but for her, could\r\nnot well have been accomplished—these times of usefulness have been\r\nfar outbalanced by her long periods of inactivity.\r\n\r\nApart from commercial considerations, however, this premier leviathan\r\nstill stands out as a wonder and pattern of naval construction.\r\nIn her admirably-conceived and splendidly-wrought structural\r\narrangements—due to the joint labours of the late Mr I. K. Brunel\r\nand Mr J. Scott Russell—she possesses as successful an embodiment\r\nof the dual quality of “strength-with-lightness” as can be found in\r\nany subsequent ocean-going merchant ship. She was, if not the first,\r\ncertainly the greatest embodiment of the longitudinal system of\r\nconstruction, and in virtue of this, as well as of her phenomenal\r\nproportions, she represents, alone, more of the intrepidity and skill\r\nessential to thorough progress, than are exhibited by combined hosts\r\nof the “departures” of recent times.\r\n\r\nDespite the far-reaching views of the eminent designer, those\r\nchanges which have since taken place in the essential conditions for\r\nsuccessful ocean navigation eluded his vision. Owing to the opening\r\nof coal mines in almost all parts of the world, it is now no longer\r\nnecessary nor desirable that a steamer should be capable of carrying\r\ncoals for a return voyage, either from India or Australia—this being\r\nthe dominant and regulating condition in the _Great Eastern’s_\r\ndesign. Further, the improvements in marine engineering, represented\r\nby the greater possible economies in coal consumption and the\r\nfuller utilization of steam, which have since been effected, have\r\nrendered the great ship inefficient and obsolete. In short, Brunel\r\nand his financial supporters were ahead of their time, and failed to\r\nappreciate the law of progress, now better understood—“invention must\r\nwait on experience.”\r\n\r\nThe urgent demands of our broader civilisation, improvements in\r\nnavigation, the spread of population in new colonies and over wider\r\ncontinents, and, above all, the fresh accessions of experience and\r\ninvention, are forces which now impel shipowners to increase the\r\ndimensions of their vessels, and shipbuilders to carry out the work.\r\nEach year the contrasts as to dimensions between the first leviathan\r\nand her later sister grow less and less. The completion within the\r\npast few years of such monster merchant ships as the _Servia_, the\r\n_City of Rome_, the _Alaska_, and the _Oregon_, and the forward state\r\nof the _Etruria_ and _Umbria_, two remarkable steamships, building\r\non the Clyde for the Cunard Company, constitute an epoch in the\r\nhistory of our mercantile marine, and give colourable justification\r\nto the belief sometimes expressed, that the proportions of the _Great\r\nEastern_ will in time be surpassed.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility—in a scientific sense—of ships growing in proportions\r\ncommensurate with the growth of commerce and traffic, has often\r\nbeen commented upon. The whole tendency of our time is towards the\r\naggregation of effort: the massing of capital and labour. A\r\nvessel of five thousand tons can be built cheaper than five vessels\r\nof one thousand tons. In the manning and working of ships there is\r\na still more striking economy, _e.g._, one captain instead of five,\r\nand so on throughout the staff of officers, engineers, stewards, and\r\ncrew. Not only so, but long ships can be propelled at greater speeds\r\nthan short ones, the whole conditions of construction, engines, and\r\npropellers being considered. Mr Robert Duncan, in his presidential\r\naddress before the Society of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Glasgow\r\nin 1872, declared:—“Looking forward one generation, and measuring\r\nthe future by the past, I think it is not problematical that we\r\nshall see steamers of eight hundred feet long the ferryboats of two\r\noceans, with America for their central station, and Europe and Asia\r\nfor their working termini.” Even since that was uttered, eleven years\r\nago, we have approached, in solid practice, the limit thus laid down,\r\nby 150 feet at least. Three years previous to Mr Duncan’s address,\r\nvessels exceeding four hundred feet were not afloat, with the notable\r\nexception already referred to; now, there are few merchant fleets of\r\nany pretensions engaged in ocean traffic which do not include vessels\r\nover or approaching four hundred feet, and it is even no great boast\r\nthat vessels close on six hundred feet are afloat and in active\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAs better illustrating the growth in dimensions of merchant\r\nsteamships, the Figs. on the following page may prove interesting.\r\nThey show, all to the same scale, a number of representative steam\r\nvessels from the _Comet_ downwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “COMET,” 1812.\r\n\r\n“ELIZABETH,” 1813.\r\n\r\n“INDUSTRY,” 1814.\r\n\r\n“CALEDONIA,” 1815.\r\n\r\n“ROB ROY,” 1818.\r\n\r\n“JAMES WATT,” 1822.\r\n\r\n“SIRIUS,” 1837.\r\n\r\n“GREAT BRITAIN,” 1843.\r\n\r\n“CITY OF GLASGOW,” 1850.\r\n\r\n“GREAT EASTERN,” 1857.\r\n\r\n“SCOTIA,” 1861.\r\n\r\n“COLUMBA,” 1878.\r\n\r\n“ARIZONA,” 1876.\r\n\r\n“SERVIA,” 1881.\r\n\r\n“CITY OF ROME,” 1881.]\r\n\r\nAlong with the change or evolution in the sizes and types of merchant\r\nvessels, important modifications in their structural arrangement have\r\nof late years been effected, and it is to the constant progress being\r\nmade in these matters—to the skill and intrepidity which are brought\r\nto bear on their execution, and to the readiness with which our\r\nshipowners recognise their importance and value—that the maintenance\r\nof our mercantile supremacy is largely owing. An American journal,\r\nwriting a few years ago on this subject—perhaps with more of taunt\r\nfor the conceit and self-sufficiency evinced by its own country than\r\nof adulation for the ability and enterprise displayed by ours—said:—\r\n\r\n  “In the whole world there is no place whatever that can in any\r\n  degree compare with the Clyde for either extent or quality of\r\n  steamship building; and at this moment an indisputable verification\r\n  can be adduced, for between American and European ports there are\r\n  at the present time something like a score of steam navigation\r\n  companies, doing an immense passenger and carrying trade, with\r\n  vessels of great power and magnificence, and notwithstanding the\r\n  variety of trade nationalities, at least two-thirds of the vessels\r\n  employed were built and equipped on the Clyde; and more—unless\r\n  there has very recently been a change, there is not an American\r\n  steam company in the whole Atlantic trade. With a run of about\r\n  fifty years to try it, and after many unsuccessful attempts, the\r\n  Americans have utterly failed to sustain permanent competition.\r\n  All the British companies have prospered beyond any probable\r\n  anticipation clothed with reason. The Cunard Company, starting\r\n  with four vessels some forty years ago, have now twenty times that\r\n  number. What is this something which enables Europeans to so far\r\n  outstrip the Americans in a competitive traffic so as to exclude\r\n  them from the merest show in the largest steam trade in the world?\r\n  A baneful, overweening, and ignorantly selfish conceit invariably\r\n  leads to disastrous results, and a nation given over to the\r\n  fulmination of concentrated boast cannot fail to be suffocated with\r\n  foolery of its own making.”\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless the outcome of a vicious antipathy—natural in the\r\ncircumstances—to those stringent and over-reaching laws which forbid\r\nthat ships built away from America shall sail under the American\r\nflag, or enjoy the pertaining privileges. American shipbuilders thus\r\nsecured from the encroaches of foreign competition, have enjoyed\r\ntheir own pace, but at too great a sacrifice. Preferring to take\r\nthe material most at hand, the manipulation of which they well\r\nunderstood, they have allowed their wood age to be dove-tailed thirty\r\nyears into our iron one, with the other result that America now\r\noccupies as unimportant a place in the traffic of the sea, as the\r\nabove quotation indicates.\r\n\r\nEvidences are not wanting, however, to show that America is at least\r\nendeavouring, in some respects, to be abreast of the times, and that\r\nshe has brought herself to acknowledge and follow the lead of this\r\ncountry. In this connection, the four new vessels presently being\r\nconstructed for the U.S. Navy may be shortly referred to. The vessels\r\ncomprise three cruisers and one despatch boat, all of which are being\r\nbuilt by Mr John Roach, of Chester, Pa., the material employed in\r\ntheir construction being mild steel of American manufacture. Twin\r\nscrews will be employed for the propulsion of the largest vessel—the\r\n_Chicago_—which is to be 315 feet long between perpendiculars, 48\r\nfeet beam, and 34 feet 9 inches moulded depth to spar deck. The other\r\nvessels are the _Boston_ and the _Atalanta_, single screw cruisers of\r\n270 feet length; and the _Dolphin_, single screw despatch boat, of\r\n250 feet length and high speed.\r\n\r\nIn almost every feature except machinery these new American naval\r\nvessels strongly resemble Government vessels of recent British build,\r\na circumstance for which there is little difficulty in accounting,\r\nas it is well known the naval authorities in the States have within\r\nrecent times been recruited by young American naval architects\r\neducated in our Naval College at Greenwich, and consequently steeped\r\nin British naval practice. This and other facts, such as the visit\r\nof a technical commissioner of the States’ navy, two years ago, to\r\nour naval and mercantile shipyards—upon which he has since fully\r\nreported—leave one in no doubt as to the source of coincidence in\r\ndesign and structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.S.

Doubtless, however,\r\nthe amount of wood and composite building still carried on in the\r\nminor seaports of the United Kingdom, and in several of the British\r\npossessions, is of sufficient importance to demand some reference. As\r\nthe present position of affairs in this connection is briefly and\r\nforcibly illustrated by statistics compiled and issued by the British\r\nIron Trade Association, two tables taken from this source may be\r\ngiven, the subject thereafter being finally departed from:—\r\n\r\n  _Tonnage of Vessels constructed and registered in the United\r\n  Kingdom of Iron, Steel, and Wood respectively, in each of the years\r\n  1879 to 1883, with Percentage of Total Tonnage constructed in Iron\r\n  and Steel._\r\n\r\n  +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |       |           Gross Tonnage of Vessels built of           |\r\n  |       +-------------------+---------------+-------------------+\r\n  | Year. |  Iron and Steel.  |     Wood.     | Excess Tonnage in |\r\n  |       |                   |               |  Iron and Steel.  |\r\n  +-------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+\r\n  | 1879  |      484,636      |     26,186    |      458,450      |\r\n  | 1880  |      525,568      |     19,938    |      505,630      |\r\n  | 1881  |      730,686      |     18,107    |      712,579      |\r\n  | 1882  |      913,519      |     14,850    |      898,669      |\r\n  | 1883  |    1,012,735      |     15,202    |      997,533      |\r\n  +-------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+\r\n  |Totals,|    3,667,144      |     94,283    |    3,572,861      |\r\n  +-------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n  _Tonnage of Wooden Vessels registered in the United Kingdom which\r\n  were Lost, Broken up, &c., during each of the years 1879 to 1883,\r\n  with Tonnage of Wooden Vessels built and registered in the United\r\n  Kingdom during the same period._\r\n\r\n  +-------+----------------------------+-------------------+\r\n  |       | Tonnage of Wooden Vessels. | Excess of Vessels |\r\n  | Year. +-------------+--------------+  lost over those  |\r\n  |       |    Lost.    |    Built.    |       built.      |\r\n  +-------+-------------+--------------+-------------------+\r\n  | 1879  |   149,828   |    26,186    |      123,642      |\r\n  | 1880  |   173,065   |    19,938    |      153,127      |\r\n  | 1881  |   170,283   |    18,107    |      152,176      |\r\n  | 1882  |   166,809   |    14,850    |      151,959      |\r\n  | 1883  |   144,138   |    15,202    |      128,936      |\r\n  +-------+-------------+--------------+-------------------+\r\n  |Totals,|   804,123   |    94,283    |      709,840      |\r\n  +-------+-------------+--------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n  Whence it appears that while 709,840 tons of the 1,779,112 tons\r\n  of ships removed from the register during the last five years\r\n  were wooden vessels, only 94,283 tons of the 3,667,144 tons built\r\n  and registered in the United Kingdom during the same period\r\n  were constructed of that material. In other words, wooden ships\r\n  represent 45 per cent. of the total losses, while they only\r\n  represent 2·5 per cent. of the total tonnage built and added to the\r\n  register during the five years in question.\r\n\r\nJust as the introduction or general adoption of the compound\r\nengine marked an epoch in the history of shipbuilding and marine\r\npropulsion, so now the introduction of “mild steel” or “ingot\r\niron” as a material for shipbuilding, together with the more\r\nextended adoption of water ballast, and the rapid development of the\r\ncontinuous-cellular system of construction, may be said to constitute\r\na fresh starting point in the history of the industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the introduction of steel as a material for shipbuilding\r\ndates at least as far back as 1860, its use has been but partial\r\nor occasional until within very recent times. The uncertainty as\r\nto quality, the frequent great disparity between pieces cut from\r\nthe same plate, and the special care needed in the manipulation,\r\nprevented its general adoption. With the highly-improved “mild\r\nsteel,” however, first manufactured in France, and applied to\r\nshipbuilding purposes there about nine years ago, and subsequently\r\nintroduced into this country, began the more extended adoption of\r\nsteel, which every day, or with every accession to experience, is\r\ndisplacing iron.\r\n\r\nThe facts relating to the introduction into this country of mild\r\nsteel for shipbuilding purposes, may be briefly recounted. In the\r\nlatter end of 1874, Admiral Sir W. Houston Stewart, Controller of\r\nthe British Navy, and Mr N. Barnaby, Director of Naval Construction,\r\navailed themselves of the opportunity to observe and study the use\r\nof steel in the French dockyards of Lorient and Brest, where three\r\nfirst-class armour-plated vessels were then being built of steel\r\nthroughout, supplied from the works at Creusot and Terrenoire. Mr\r\nBarnaby, at the meetings of the Institution of Naval Architects in\r\nMarch following, gave an account of his observations during this\r\nvisit, and pointed out clearly and precisely to the steel-makers of\r\nGreat Britain all the indispensable conditions which would have to be\r\nmet and satisfied by steel for shipbuilding, so that it could be used\r\nwith confidence in the construction of the largest vessels. Before\r\nthe end of 1875, the Landore-Siemens Company was enabled to fulfil\r\nthese conditions, and the Admiralty contracted with them to supply\r\nthe plates and angles necessary for the construction of two cruisers\r\nof high speed—the _Iris_ and the _Mercury_. The material involved\r\nin this contract was steel obtained by the Siemens-Martin process.\r\nShortly after this the Bolton Steel Company was in its turn able to\r\nproduce by the Bessemer process plates and angles, satisfying all\r\nthe requisite conditions. The Steel Company of Scotland, Butterly\r\nCompany, and other important works, also entered into the same\r\nbusiness, and operations are still going on in various parts of the\r\ncountry connected with the formation of new works, and the perfecting\r\nof other processes.\r\n\r\nThe steel furnished by these different works, subjected as it\r\nhas been to systematic and severe tests continually applied, is\r\nnow possessed of the qualities of ductility, malleability, and\r\nhomogeneity, which render its employment in shipbuilding not only\r\npermissible but highly desirable. Its good and reliable qualities\r\nhave been admitted by the Constructors of the Navy, the Officers of\r\nthe Board of Trade, of Lloyd’s, and of the Liverpool Registries, as\r\nwell as by all the most competent authorities. The experience of all\r\nwho have practical dealings with the material in the shipyard is\r\nthat it entirely satisfies—even more than iron—all the requirements\r\nof easy manipulation. The confidence with which it can be relied on,\r\nas to its certain and uniform qualities, places it on a much higher\r\nlevel than the steel formerly manufactured; and its superiority over\r\nthe best wrought-iron as regards strength and ductility renders it a\r\nhighly preferable material.\r\n\r\nWhile doubt exists, however, as to the adoption of steel for\r\nshipbuilding being commercially advantageous; there must be hesitancy\r\non the part of shipowners and others concerned. Although, since its\r\nintroduction, mild steel has been greatly reduced in price, the\r\nfirst cost of a steel ship is still somewhat over that of an iron\r\none, even after the reduction in weight of material is made, which\r\nthe superiority of steel permits of. It has been shown that, about\r\ntwo years ago, a spar-decked steamer, of 4,000 tons gross, built in\r\nsteel, as against a similar vessel built in iron, entailed an excess\r\nin cost of £3,570. The advantages, however, which accrue from the\r\nchange, both immediate and in the long run, make the gain clear and\r\nconsiderable. Steel ships have been built with scantlings reduced\r\none-fourth or one-third, and in some early cases even _one-half_,\r\nfrom what would have been considered requisite had iron been\r\nemployed. Some authorities, not unnaturally, questioned the wisdom\r\nof accrediting steel with all the qualities which make such sweeping\r\nreductions justifiable. Except in vessels for river or passenger\r\nservice, however, this is much in advance of the reductions obtained\r\nin ordinary modern practice.\r\n\r\nThe reductions allowed in vessels built to Lloyd’s requirements—and\r\nit cannot be urged that this society is too reckless in concessions\r\nof this nature—are 20 per cent. in scantling, and 18 per cent. in\r\nweight. As it is impossible to adjust the scantlings of material\r\nto take the full advantage of these reductions, and further, as\r\nallowance has to be made for extra weight due to the continued use\r\nof iron in vessels of steel—for purposes not essential to structural\r\ncharacter—the average weight-saving effected in practice is about\r\n13 to 14 per cent. This represents, in the finished vessel, a clear\r\nincrease of at least 13 per cent. in dead-weight carrying power. The\r\ngain obtained in general practice has been otherwise stated on good\r\nauthority as 7 to 7½ per cent. of the gross tonnage.\r\n\r\nIn trades where there is constancy of dead-weight cargoes, this\r\nincrease in dead-weight carrying power should speedily recoup\r\nthe owners for extra first cost, and in the life-time of vessels\r\ngenerally, a clear pecuniary gain should result. In trades, however,\r\nwhere the cargo consists of measurement goods, the advantages are not\r\nso decided, for it may sometimes happen that before vessels have been\r\nloaded to their maximum draught the limits of stowage will have been\r\nreached. Even here, however, the steel vessel has the advantage of\r\nher iron rival; her hull is 13 per cent. lighter, and consequently\r\nmay be propelled at a given speed with much less expenditure\r\nof power, and has the further advantage—often a very important\r\none—of a shallower draught. This latter consideration alone, in a\r\nservice where every iota of such saving counts, has influenced many\r\nshipowners to adopt the steel.\r\n\r\nAs the manufacture of mild steel progresses and extends, the\r\nassimilation of the rival materials as to cost is sure to follow.\r\nAlready very great advances have been made towards this end, the\r\nfact being abundantly evidenced by the greatly increased number of\r\nsteel ships on hand, and by the establishment of new works, and\r\ntransformation of old, for the better production of the new material.\r\nIn 1877 mild steel was about twice as costly as the iron in common\r\nuse. The sources of supply, however, were then comparatively few, and\r\nthe thorough and severe testing to which the new material had to be\r\nsubjected, necessarily increased the cost relatively to iron, which\r\nhas never been subjected to the same rigorous ordeal. In 1880, owing\r\nto the increased sources of supply and the progress in manufacture,\r\nthe cost of steel had been reduced, relatively to iron, by about\r\n50 per cent. At the time of writing (March, 1884), the price of\r\nsteel for a good-sized vessel is—overhead—about seven pounds, seven\r\nshillings and sixpence per ton; while the corresponding figure for\r\niron is about five pounds, five shillings, or a difference of only\r\nabout twenty-nine per cent. in favour of the older material.\r\n\r\nDoubts were at first expressed by not a few, regarding the durability\r\nof steel ships compared with those of iron, such misgivings being\r\naggravated by the thinness of the steel plating. This fear is being\r\ngradually lessened by the results of laboratory experiments and\r\n_bona fide_ experience—the broad deduction from which is, that the\r\ndeterioration of steel, under the action of sea water, is no greater\r\nthan that of iron, and that, if the same care and constancy in\r\ncleaning and painting, common to ships of the latter material, be\r\nextended to ships of the former, their durability will be equal.\r\n\r\nSeveral large shipowning companies were not slow to place faith in\r\nthe new material. In the early part of 1879, the “Allan Line” Company\r\nentrusted to Messrs Denny & Brothers, of Dumbarton, the order for a\r\nhuge vessel, which the intrepid confidence of the principal partners\r\nin both the owning and the building firms determined should be of\r\nmild steel, be bound with steel rivets, and have her boilers of\r\nthe same material. This was the large steamer _Buenos Ayrean_, the\r\nfirst transatlantic steamer built with the new material. She was\r\nfinished early in 1880, and had not been over nine months in the\r\nwater when the order for a second and still larger steel vessel—the\r\n_Parisian_—had been given by the same owners to Clyde builders. The\r\nUnion Steamship Company of New Zealand, the Pacific Steam Navigation\r\nCompany, Messrs Donald Currie & Co., and several smaller companies,\r\nordered vessels of steel almost simultaneously, while yet the new\r\nmaterial was in the early stage of trial. Amongst the orders for\r\nsteel vessels which were subsequently given, the _Servia_ and\r\n_Catalonia_, for the Cunard Company; the _Clyde_ and _Thames_ and\r\n_Shannon_ for the Peninsular and Oriental Company; the _India_, for\r\nthe British India Company; the _Arabic_ and _Coptic_, for the Oceanic\r\nSteam Navigation Company, and the four twin screw steamers of the\r\n“Hill” Line, represent the principals. The companies who then adopted\r\nthe new material have mostly continued to have their new ships built\r\nof steel, and to name the vessels since built and now building\r\nin which this material is employed, would simply be to enumerate\r\nthree-fourths the fleet of high-class modern merchant ships. There\r\nwere 21,000 tons of steel shipping built throughout the United\r\nKingdom in 1879; 36,000 in 1880; 55,000 in 1881; 126,000 in 1882; and\r\nover 244,000 in 1883. It is computed that at the present time the\r\namount of steel shipbuilding going on throughout the kingdom is not\r\nless than 175,000 tons, or the largest amount on hand at any one time\r\nsince its introduction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe modification in the structural arrangement of ocean trading\r\nvessels, already spoken of as the continuous-cellular system,\r\nalthough only within very recent times receiving extended adoption in\r\nthe mercantile marine, possesses in some of its essential features\r\nthe prestige of years. So long ago as 1854, Mr Scott Russell strongly\r\nadvocated the principle of longitudinal construction, and applied\r\nit in practice to ships of the mercantile marine, to the success\r\nof which, in a scientific sense, the _Great Eastern_ is surely\r\noverwhelming testimony. The principle met with much scientific favour\r\nfrom many besides Mr Russell, but it did not take root in solid\r\npractice. Pecuniary and other kinds of considerations interposed\r\nto prevent its general adoption. The urgency for increase in the\r\nsize of vessels was not such as to make longitudinal strength (the\r\nspecial advantage claimed for the new principle) a great desideratum;\r\nand there was perhaps reluctance on the part of shipbuilders to\r\nrelinquish time-tried and familiar methods. The system presently\r\nunder notice—although, as has already been said, the same, in its\r\nmain principles, as the system then advocated—by its descent through\r\nthe Admiralty Dockyards, by its application to merchant vessels—first\r\nof East Coast, and then of Clyde build—and by its close association\r\nwith water ballast, has undergone many modifications which almost\r\nconstitute it a creation of recent times.\r\n\r\nSir Edward J. Reed, when Chief Constructor of the Navy, introduced\r\nthe bracket frame system of construction into iron-clad ships of war,\r\nand, as already indicated, it is largely owing to the experience\r\nof the system as applied and practised in such cases—conjointly,\r\nof course, with its successful introduction in the case of the\r\n_Great Eastern_—that in so short a time it has reached the present\r\nstructural perfection, and received such wide extension in merchant\r\nsteamships. That it has recently received such wide adoption in the\r\nmercantile marine is due not so much to its structural advantages—and\r\nthese are great—as to the way in which it lends itself to the\r\neconomical working of steamships in actual service. This will be\r\nmore explicitly referred to after some description of the system as\r\napplied in merchant ships has been given.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat away from the field this work is concerned with, to\r\ntrace the system in its stages of development in ships of war, but it\r\nmay be said, shortly, that the impulse which the system has received\r\nin the mercantile marine has in no sense been a transference of the\r\nactivity which at all times since its introduction has characterised\r\nthe application of the system to the vessels built in our naval yards.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist the non-technical reader in appreciating what\r\nfollows regarding the system in merchant ships, a general idea of\r\nthe cellular bottom principle of construction is afforded by Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThis shows in section the bottom part of a vessel amidships, fitted\r\nwith a double or inner skin, extending across the ship from bilge to\r\nbilge, and there connected in a watertight manner to the outer bottom\r\nplating. A series of longitudinal plates are worked, fore and aft;\r\nset vertically between the outer skin of the vessel and the plating\r\nof the inner bottom, and connected thereto by continuous angles.\r\nBetween these “longitudinals,” and at every alternate transverse\r\nframe, deep plate floors, lightened with oval holes, are fitted,\r\nconnected to outer skin by the angle frame, and to inner bottom\r\nplating by pieces of angles corresponding to the vessel’s “reverse\r\nframes.” These floor plates are, in addition, connected by vertical\r\nangles to the longitudinals. Intermediate between the deep plate\r\nfloors simple angle bar transverse frames and reverse frames are\r\nfitted, to give support to the outer skin and to the inner bottom\r\nrespectively. Until recently, the deep floors consisted of “gusset”\r\nor “bracket” plates, each division being fitted in four separate\r\npieces, the whole taking the form as shown in dotted outline. This\r\npractice is still most largely followed, but in those yards which are\r\nequipped with large hydraulic punching machines for piercing holes\r\nsuch as are shown in Fig. 1, the solid floors have superseded the\r\nbracket or four-piece floors, the change effecting a simplification\r\nof work and decided structural advantages.\r\n\r\nWith the employment of water as a substitute for dry or rubble\r\nballast, the structural movement under notice may be said primarily\r\nto have begun. This movement has resulted in the present approved\r\nsystem, which, at the same time that it has regard to water-ballast\r\nwith all its attendant advantages, most happily combines the\r\nimportant qualities of increased strength and security. The need\r\nfor ballast in vessels whose service generally comprises “light” as\r\nwell as “loaded” runs (as in the coal trade between Newcastle and\r\nLondon), or in trades where the full complement can only be obtained\r\nby shifting from port to port, is obviously great. It is doubtless to\r\nneeds such as these, more than to any demand for increased structural\r\nstrength, that the introduction and extended application of the\r\nlongitudinal and bracket-plate principle is owing.\r\n\r\nThe screw-steamer _Sentinel_, built in 1860 by Messrs Palmer of\r\nJarrow, Newcastle-on-Tyne, is mentioned by some authorities as\r\nembodying some of the main features of the longitudinal and cellular\r\nbottom system, and the screw-steamers _Scio_ and _Assyria_, of 1440\r\ntons, built in 1874 by Messrs Westerman, near Genoa, have been\r\nnoticed in a similar connection. The next vessel, in point of time,\r\nwhich contained features answering to the system now in vogue, and\r\nfrom the date of whose production the movement has been almost\r\nconstantly progressive, was the screw-steamer _Fenton_, built by\r\nMessrs Austin & Hunter, of Sunderland, in 1876.\r\n\r\nClyde builders were not slow to recognise the value of the system in\r\nits application to water-ballast steamers, and almost immediately\r\nsome of the more intrepid of their number began to advocate its\r\nadoption, but with some modifications, in vessels then being\r\ncontracted for. Mr John Inglis, jun., of Messrs A. & J. Inglis,\r\nPointhouse, Glasgow, submitted to Lloyd’s Registry in March, 1878,\r\nthe scantling section of some cellular bottom vessels, then in\r\nproject, which contained several of the improvements introduced in\r\nsubsequent practice. Messrs William Denny & Brothers, of Dumbarton,\r\nat the same time took up the principle, and have since actively\r\napplied it to steamers of every character in which water-ballast is\r\na desideratum. Adopting it, five years ago, in four sister vessels\r\nfor the British India Steam Navigation Coy., they subsequently raised\r\nthe important issue with the Board of Trade regarding the tonnage\r\nmeasurement of these vessels. This august body insisted on computing\r\nthe register tonnage—the figure upon which the tonnage dues are\r\nlevied—not to the top of the inner bottom, but to an imaginary line\r\nhalf-way down the cellular space—in fact, to where the line of floor\r\nwould have been if constructed in the ordinary fashion. Messrs Denny\r\nmaintained, in effect, that as the register tonnage was meant to be\r\na measure of the space available for cargo, the top of the ceiling\r\non the inner bottom was the only equitable line of measurement. The\r\nprincipal reason for the Board seeking to pursue this course seems to\r\nhave lain in the supposition that owners would endeavour to use the\r\ndouble bottom for cargo-carrying purposes. An ambiguity in the words\r\nof the Merchant Shipping Act, or their inapplicability to present day\r\npractice, were other possible elements in the case, but doubtless the\r\nred-tapeism and self-sufficiency characteristic of the Board had much\r\nto do with their action. This is borne out by the fact that although\r\nthe Messrs Denny succeeded in their plea with respect to vessels\r\nhaving structural cellular bottoms, the absurd practice is still\r\nfollowed in cases where the bottom is fitted for water ballast on the\r\ngirder principle, _i.e._—the inner bottom fitted upon fore and aft\r\nrunners or girders, erected on floors of the ordinary description, as\r\nshown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis formed, and still forms in many places, a very common\r\narrangement for water ballast steamers, although not so inherent a\r\nfeature of the vessel’s structure as the continuous-cellular bottom.\r\nIn most cases this system is fitted only for part of the length, and\r\nnot, like the cellular system, applied throughout the whole length of\r\nthe ship. If it was impossible for the Board of Trade to hold by the\r\ncontention that cargo might be carried in bottoms of the structural\r\ncellular type, it is equally untenable in the case of bottoms such as\r\nare now referred to. The difference between the two kinds of ballast\r\nbottoms is one merely of construction, and if any one of the two\r\nlends itself to cargo-carrying purposes, it is certainly the cellular\r\nsystem. The anomaly is sufficiently striking to merit attention, and\r\nin certain districts where the girder system is largely adopted for\r\nmedium-sized vessels, it is felt as nothing short of an injustice,\r\nboth by shipowners and builders.\r\n\r\nThe concession or victory won by Messrs Denny removed a serious\r\nhindrance to the spread and general adoption of the water ballast\r\ncellular system. Other Clyde firms at the same time—or at least soon\r\nafter the adoption of the system by the Messrs Denny—took the matter\r\nup and independently did much towards the popularisation of the\r\ncellular mode of construction. Speaking in the early part of 1880,\r\nMr William John, of Lloyd’s Registry, now General Manager with the\r\nBarrow Shipbuilding Company, said:—“At the time Mr Martell read his\r\npaper on water-ballast steamers before the autumn meeting of this\r\nInstitution (Naval Architects) at Glasgow, in 1877, there had been\r\nonly two or three small steamers built (since Mr Scott Russell’s\r\nearly ones) on the longitudinal principle. Now, it is within the\r\nmark to say there are one hundred steamers, built and building,\r\nwhose bottoms are constructed on the longitudinal principle, or\r\nwhat is better described as the cellular system, amounting probably\r\nto 200,000 tons, and it is not outside the bounds of probability\r\nthat a very few years will see the majority of merchant steamers\r\nconstructed in this manner.” Mr John’s connection with Lloyd’s at\r\nthe time, entitled his statements and opinions with regard to the\r\nprevalency and prospects of cellular construction to be accepted with\r\nevery assurance, for it is in such Societies as Lloyd’s where the\r\nbest consensus of information regarding the extent and tendencies of\r\nparticular types of vessels can be obtained. In point of fact, the\r\nintervening period has witnessed, in great measure, a realisation of\r\nMr John’s forecast. The advantages of a cellular bottom as regards\r\nsafety, and for the purpose of ballasting and trimming vessels,\r\nalso as meeting the greater need for longitudinal strength caused\r\nby the enormous growth in the size of vessels, have received that\r\nappreciation from shipowners and shipbuilders which is their due.\r\nThe practice has accordingly spread, till now, it would not be rash\r\nto say, quite as many of the ocean-trading steamers being built are\r\nfitted with cellular bottoms as are without them.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of water ballast to sailing vessels, as well as to\r\nsteamers, has received consideration at the hands of both Tyne and\r\nClyde builders. Previous to 1877, several small sailing ships were\r\nbuilt on the Tyne, in which provision was made for water ballast in\r\ntanks entering into the structure of the bottom, but erected over\r\nthe ordinary plate floors. About 150 tons of water ballast were\r\ncarried by these vessels, the filling and discharge of the tanks\r\nbeing effected by Downton’s pumps, worked by the crew. The trade\r\nin which they were engaged—_i.e._—carrying coal from the Tyne to\r\nSpanish ports, and back to this country with ore—was one in which\r\nthe introduction of water ballast proved commercially and otherwise\r\nmost advantageous. Two years subsequently Messrs A. M‘Millan & Son,\r\nDumbarton, introduced water ballast into one of the largest class of\r\nsailing vessels then being built. Unlike previous sailing ships with\r\nprovision for water ballast, however, the vessel was constructed on\r\nthe structural cellular bottom principle, having bracket floors and\r\ncontinuous girders, as so generally approved in steamships. Capacity\r\nfor water ballast, to the extent of over 300 tons was thus provided,\r\nthe filling and discharge being effected by a special donkey engine,\r\nsupplied with steam from a large donkey boiler. The boiler also\r\nfurnished the motive power for cargo winches, off which, by crank\r\ngear, the manual labour pumps were also brought into requisition.\r\nFacilities for the expeditious management of ballast—the want of\r\nwhich, in sailing vessels, considerably hinders its adoption—were\r\nthus, in this case, efficiently provided. Several other sailing\r\nships, built by Messrs A. M‘Millan & Son, and by other shipbuilding\r\nfirms on the Clyde, have been fitted with this system, and the result\r\nof experience with these vessels in actual service, thoroughly\r\nencourages its more general adoption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany minor, yet aggregately important, structural features which are\r\nproducts of the progressive movement of recent years, or are simply\r\nrevivals of old devices which were “untimely born,” still call for\r\nsome notice. As a necessary consequence of the growth in dimensions\r\nand the change in relative proportions of vessels, greater regard has\r\nbeen paid to the systems of construction in which the longitudinal\r\nprinciple is involved. This, of course, is evidenced by what has been\r\nsaid of the cellular bottom system, but various minor structural\r\nfeatures associated with the cellular bottom are also noteworthy in\r\nthis connection. It is the practice, for instance, where large ships\r\nare concerned, to fit side stringers in the holds, throughout the\r\nentire length, made intercostal with regard to transverse plate or\r\nweb-frames occurring at intervals of 16 or 20 feet, which extend from\r\nthe bilge to the main deck. This arrangement—an outline of which may\r\nbe found to the right of the section shown as Fig. 1—possesses many\r\nstructural advantages, and finds additional favour with shipowners on\r\naccount of its leaving a clearer hold for stowage by obviating the\r\nuse of transverse hold beams.\r\n\r\nRegard for transverse strength has increasingly evinced itself in\r\nthe fitting of various kinds of plate side stiffeners or partial\r\nbulkheads. This is well exemplified in a very recent case—that of\r\nthe National Company’s steamship _America_, built by Messrs J. &\r\nG. Thomson. This vessel, having been constructed independent of\r\nany special Registry Rules, embodies structural features not common\r\namongst vessels in which such rules are undeviatingly conformed\r\nto. The system referred to, of plate frames or partial bulkheads,\r\nis one of the most conspicuous of these features. Throughout the\r\nlength of the vessel, at intervals of about 18 feet, transverse plate\r\nstiffeners or frames, extending from the shell inwards about 4 feet,\r\ntake the place of the ordinary angle frames, and are continuous from\r\nfloors to upper deck, the stringers and other longitudinal features\r\nbeing scored through them. The surplus transverse strength resulting\r\nfrom this system is such as amply to compensate for uncommonly\r\nlarge breaches made in the deck beams and plating for light and\r\nair purposes in the saloons. This is a very special feature in the\r\ninterior arrangement of the _America_, and will be referred to\r\nfurther on. The regard for transverse strength, again, conjointly\r\nwith the increased attention to minute watertight sub-division,\r\nhas led to the fitting of a greater number of complete watertight\r\ntransverse bulkheads, relatively to the lengths of vessels.\r\n\r\nIn vessels of extreme proportions the method of forming shells\r\ntwo-ply, or of fitting all the shell plates edge to edge with outside\r\ncovering-strakes over the fore-and-aft joints, has been recently\r\nrevived and much improved. The system, although very expensive,\r\nhas been adopted in vessels for the Anchor Line by Messrs D. & W.\r\nHenderson, Glasgow, and subsequently on even a more extensive scale\r\nby the Barrow Shipbuilding Company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAffecting the structural character of modern ships very materially,\r\nbut the result chiefly of an economy in labour, riveting by machine\r\npower has received a wonderfully extended application within recent\r\nyears. Structurally, as well as commercially, the system has played a\r\nlarge part in the progressive movement under review. By its means the\r\nstrength of united parts has been enhanced through the increase of\r\ntheir frictional resistance, and through the rigidity of joints,\r\ndue to the more thorough filling of the rivet holes. The subject of\r\nhydraulic or machine power riveting will, however, receive fuller\r\ntreatment in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the past two or three years cast steel stems, stern-frames,\r\nand rudders, have been taking the place of forged iron work in ship\r\nconstruction. The practicability of manufacturing these of such\r\nstrength and homogeneity as would meet the needs of ship construction\r\neven better than the ordinary forged work, had occurred some five\r\nor six years ago to several engaged in the steel trade. Mr J. F.\r\nHall, of Messrs William Jessop & Sons, Limited, Sheffield, had the\r\nsubject under consideration about that period, and actually made\r\nseveral small stern posts and rudders for steam yachts and launches.\r\nThe advantages of solid and uniform steel castings over iron\r\nforgings—which, with their many weldings, so often prove inefficient\r\nwhen subject to any sudden shock—were even then rightly enough\r\nappreciated. It was only, however, after patents had been taken out\r\nby Messrs Cooke & Mylchreest, of Liverpool, for various devices\r\nconnected with the actual fitting of such features to the ship’s\r\nstructure—amongst other things the hanging of rudders without pintles\r\nor gudgeons—that the manufacture of cast steel stern-frames, rudders,\r\n&c., was seriously proceeded with.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1882, the Steel Company of Scotland (Limited), who are the\r\nmanufacturers in Scotland of Messrs Cooke & Mylchreest’s patent form\r\nof rudders and stern-frames, successfully cast a stern-frame—the\r\nfirst of large size, it is believed, made for actual use in the\r\nconstruction of a steamer. In April of the same year, however,\r\nMessrs William Jessop & Sons (Limited), of Sheffield, had exhibited\r\na crucible cast steel stern-frame and rudder of their manufacture,\r\nat the Naval and Sub-Marine Exhibition, held in London. These large\r\ncastings, along with others, were subjected to a series of tests in\r\nthe presence of Lloyd’s inspectors and other authorities, such as\r\nthe forged frames and rudders ordinarily fitted would not have come\r\nthrough without severe damage, yet all of which the steel castings\r\nwithstood most thoroughly.\r\n\r\nTestimony to the efficiency of these new features in ship\r\nconstruction has already been furnished from the arena of actual\r\nexperience, by the recent grounding of two steamers in which these\r\nfeatures had been introduced. The screw-steamer _Euripides_, a\r\nLiverpool-owned vessel of about 1780 tons gross, completed in May,\r\n1883, by Messrs Caird & Purdie, of Barrow, some time ago ran upon a\r\nreef of boulders, and remained thumping heavily for several hours.\r\nAt the time she was laden with a full cargo of grain, which was\r\nafterwards delivered in perfect condition. The cast steel stem\r\nand stern-frame, which were manufactured by the Steel Company of\r\nScotland, were practically without damage, notwithstanding that\r\nserious indentations were made in them. The stem, although receiving\r\nthe full force of resistance, was not perceptibly altered in shape,\r\nand competent judges who inspected the damage in dock were of opinion\r\nthat the stem, with its superior attachments, in all probability\r\nsaved the vessel from total loss. The rudder on the _Euripides_ is\r\nof solid cast steel, in one piece, and hung without pintles, and\r\nin a manner involving little or no riveting. In this, as in the\r\nother features, the immunity from serious damage testifies to the\r\nefficiency and durability of the steel castings. The second case of\r\ngrounding referred to is that of the screw-steamer _Strathnairn_,\r\nof 400 tons, belonging to Messrs James Hay & Sons, of Glasgow;\r\none of two vessels built by Messrs Burrell & Son, of Dumbarton,\r\nin which cast steel stern-frames and rudders were adopted. This\r\nvessel got aground while off Harrington, on the north-west coast\r\nof England, about the latter end of March of the present year. Her\r\nstern-frame sustained very considerable shock: such, indeed, as\r\nno ordinary forged work could possibly have undergone with like\r\nresult. Subsequent docking showed that it would only be necessary to\r\nstraighten the frame at the deflected portions in order to make it\r\nagain structurally efficient. This was done, and the vessel is again\r\nactively engaged in service.\r\n\r\nThe weldless stern-frames, rudders, and stems, as patented by Messrs\r\nCooke & Mylchreest, Liverpool, and manufactured for them by the Steel\r\nCompany of Scotland, Messrs Jessop & Sons, Sheffield, and Messrs John\r\nSpencer & Sons, Newcastle, have various advantageous features which\r\nmay be noticed somewhat fully. One of these is the casting of flanges\r\non the stern-posts, for attaching the shell plates to; by which\r\narrangement much of the difficult and costly work in the riveting and\r\nfitting of the shell plates at these parts is done away with, while\r\na considerable increase of strength is obtained. The solid rudder\r\nis a great improvement on the built rudder as usually fitted; the\r\nentire absence of rivets being an important desideratum. The rivets\r\nconnecting the rudder-plates to the frame-forging are frequently a\r\nsource of trouble and annoyance, through their being loosened by the\r\nconstant vibration of the rudder, and the shocks it often receives.\r\nThe heads of the rivets not unfrequently drop off, and the rivets\r\nthemselves sometimes fall completely out. All this, of course, is\r\nentirely obviated in the solid rudder. By Messrs Cooke & Mylchreest’s\r\nimproved method of fitting the rudder—a device which is only\r\napplicable in a casting—pintles are wholly dispensed with, and in\r\ntheir place a much stronger joint is substituted, with a considerably\r\nincreased wearing surface. The rudder is also jointed at the top of\r\nthe blade, by means of strong flanges bolted together; an obvious\r\nadvantage of this arrangement being that it can be readily unshipped,\r\neven when afloat.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stern-frames, stems, and rudders, there are, also\r\nbeing supplied, keels, garboard strakes, and centre keelsons in long\r\nlengths. It is claimed for these that as the keel, garboard strake,\r\nkeelson, and brackets for connecting the floors, are all made in one\r\npiece, they are much stronger than as ordinarily constructed, and\r\nthat a considerable saving in both labour and rivets is effected. As\r\nthere are no angle irons to contend with, the limber-holes may be\r\nmade close to the bottom plating, and a much thinner layer of cement\r\nwill, consequently, be needed on the bottom; the saving in this\r\nrespect, according to the patentees’ calculation, being 50 tons in a\r\n2,000-ton vessel.\r\n\r\nAs the prices of these frames and rudders do not exceed those charged\r\nfor frames of wrought-iron, and moreover, owing to the pieces which\r\nare cast on to them forming attachments for keels, decks, &c.—thus\r\ncheapening the work of construction in the shipyard—there appears\r\nto be no question of their great superiority. The presence of\r\nblow-holes, not unfrequently a source of misgiving in castings, is\r\nfound from experience to be a constantly diminishing fault in these\r\narticles. The demand for them has steadily grown since their adoption\r\nin a few actual cases. It would seem, indeed, that the demand is\r\nonly limited by the powers of production possessed at present by the\r\nfour or five steel-making firms who have undertaken this class of\r\nwork, and have satisfied the requirements of the registration and the\r\ninsurance societies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the frames and rudders for ordinary screw vessels,\r\nthe Steel Company of Scotland have also supplied several sterns for\r\nwar vessels, with rams and torpedo openings, which have proved very\r\nsatisfactory. Other new adaptations are the casting of large brackets\r\nfor shafts of twin screw vessels, of large crank shafts themselves,\r\nand of heavy anchors; the results of tests presently being made fully\r\nwarranting the anticipation that the material will very largely be\r\nemployed in the future for these important items in the outfit of\r\nmerchant vessels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe more important features of growth or change in ship construction\r\nwhich have made the past few years a noteworthy period in the\r\nhistory of mercantile shipbuilding have now been reviewed. Speed,\r\nand propulsive power of steamships, although absorbing very much\r\nof the progress for which the period has been so remarkable, have\r\nnot been dealt with, but are reserved for the chapter following.\r\nThe subjects named will also necessarily receive some attention in\r\nthe chapter devoted to progress in the science of shipbuilding. In\r\nanticipation, however, apologies should be offered for the paucity of\r\ndetailed references to the propulsive agents on board ship. Marine\r\nengineering, in all its recent developments, would require for its\r\nproper treatment considerably more space than can be devoted to it in\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\nTo meet the exigencies of the progressive movement, both practical\r\nskill, scientific knowledge, and commercial enterprise have been\r\nneeded on the part of our shipbuilders. These have not been by any\r\nmeans wanting, as abundantly evidenced by the foregoing record\r\nof what has been achieved. With a continuance of that readiness\r\ndisplayed by shipbuilders and naval architects to modify, and even\r\nrevolutionize if need be, types and methods which the times have\r\noutgrown, the lead in merchant shipbuilding will long be ours. With a\r\nmaintenance also of the enterprise shown by our shipowners, Britain\r\nwill still continue, as regards the number, size, and power of her\r\nmerchant ships, supreme among the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Papers and Lectures bearing on recent improvements in\r\nship design and construction, to which readers desiring fuller\r\nacquaintance with the _technique_ and details of the subjects are\r\nreferred:—\r\n\r\n  ON A NEW MODE OF CONSTRUCTING IRON AND COMPOSITE SHIPS, by Mr J.

In no ocean\r\nservice is the truth of this so apparent as in the transatlantic mail\r\nand passenger service, the oldest and most constantly progressive,\r\nand where at the present time, certainly more than at any former\r\nperiod, the contest for supremacy amongst rival steamship lines\r\nhas assumed the form of increased speed and enhanced passenger\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic service, for these reasons, as well as because it\r\nexemplifies more of the fruits which have rewarded the joint labours\r\nof the engineer and shipbuilder in improving marine propulsion, may\r\nbe selected for detailed review. In other ocean services, of course,\r\nthe achievements of engineering and shipbuilding skill have also\r\nbeen made apparent, and in ways, perhaps, which the Atlantic service\r\ndoes not exhibit. Reference to these will afterwards be made, but\r\nattention will meantime be confined to the service stated, and to\r\nsuch considerations of the general progress made in ocean navigation\r\nas are necessarily involved in the particular subject.\r\n\r\nIt is needless, in view of the frequency with which the story of\r\nocean steam navigation is told, and especially, considering the\r\nscope of the present review, to enter at any length into the details\r\nof early service. The first practically successful transatlantic\r\nsteamers were the _Sirius_ and the _Great Western_, the first a\r\npaddle-steamer 170 feet long, 270 horse-power originally constructed\r\nto ply between London and Cork, and the latter, a paddle-steamer, 212\r\nfeet long and about 440 horse-power, designed and built expressly for\r\nthe transatlantic service. The _Sirius_ left Cork on the 4th April,\r\n1838, and reached New York on the 22nd; the _Great Western_ left\r\nBristol on the 7th April, three days after the _Sirius_, reaching\r\nNew York on the 23rd—the time taken being thus 18 days and 15 days\r\nrespectively. The return voyages of these pioneer long-passage\r\nsteamers were made in 16 days and 14 days respectively, their\r\nperformances at once establishing the superiority of steamers,\r\ncommercially and otherwise, over the sailing ships which had\r\npreviously for so long been the recognised medium of transit in the\r\nAtlantic passenger trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 a regular mail service by steamers was first introduced\r\non the Atlantic. The first of these mail steamers was the Cunard\r\npaddle-steamer _Britannia_, 207 feet long, which sailed from\r\nLiverpool on July 4, 1840, and arrived at Halifax in 12 days 10\r\nhours, the return journey being performed in 10 days. The _Acadia_,\r\n_Columbia_, and _Caledonia_ all of about the same dimensions as\r\nthe _Britannia_, at once followed. The success of the Cunard Line\r\nwas so marked that opposition was soon provoked, and in 1850 the\r\nCollins Line of American steamers started to compete with the Cunard\r\nliners. The same year also saw the commencement of the well-known\r\nInman Company, of Liverpool, their first vessel being the _City of\r\nGlasgow_, an iron screw-steamer of 1680 tons and 350 horse-power. The\r\nAllan and Anchor Lines were established in 1856, the Guion Line in\r\n1863, and the White Star Line in 1870.\r\n\r\nWith the substitution of the screw propeller for the paddle wheel,\r\nfirst carried out to any great purpose in the small steamer\r\n_Archimedes_ in 1839, but introduced with even greater effect in the\r\nAtlantic steamer _Great Britain_ in 1843, was laid the basis of that\r\nprogressive and magnificent success in propulsion which has since\r\nattended ocean navigation. It was with screw-steamers Mr Inman boldly\r\nassailed the Cunard Company in 1850, but notwithstanding this, it was\r\nonly in 1862 that the Government consented to sanction the use of\r\nthe screw in the mail steamers of the Cunard Company. The _Scotia_,\r\nmeasuring 366 feet in length, by 47½ feet in breadth, and 30½ feet\r\ndepth, launched in 1861, was the last paddle-steamer built for this\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe other great improvements contributing to the success spoken of,\r\nwere the introduction of engines designed on the compound principle,\r\nand a little later, the employment of the surface condenser, and\r\nthe use of circular multitubular boilers. In spite of the success\r\nwith which the compound system was attended in vessels built for\r\nthe Pacific Steam Navigation Company as early as 1856, and for some\r\nother private owners soon after, the great steamship companies, and\r\nshipowners generally, were very slow to adopt it. It was not until\r\nabout the year 1869 that the compound engine came into general use,\r\nand it was only in 1872 that the Cunard Company seriously took it\r\ninto favour.\r\n\r\nThe early steamers of the Cunard Line possessed an average speed of\r\n8½ knots, and took about 15 days for the voyage. Through the Collins\r\nrivalry the speed was increased to an average of 12½ knots, and\r\nthe time for crossing the Atlantic was reduced to 12 days 9 hours\r\noutwards, and 11 days 11 hours homewards. In 1856, the powerful\r\npaddle-steamer _Persia_ (the first iron vessel built for the Cunard\r\nCompany) was placed on the service, and attained an average speed\r\nof about 13 knots, consuming 150 tons of coal per day. She made the\r\ndistance between Queenstown and New York, on an average, in 10½ days.\r\nIn 1862 the _Scotia_, belonging to the same company, made the passage\r\nin 9 days.\r\n\r\nComing down to more recent times, the White Star Line, with its\r\nsteamships _Britannic_ and _Germanic_, built in 1874 and 1875\r\nrespectively, held for a considerable period first place in the\r\nmatter of fast steamships. The vessels named were, however, in\r\ntime beaten by the newer ships _Gallia_, of the Cunard Line, and\r\n_Arizona_, of the Guion Line. As illustrating the speed at which\r\nthe vessels named accomplished the transatlantic voyage—between\r\nQueenstown and New York—the following brief list, compiled from\r\npublished records, of fast runs out and home during the period\r\n1875-1881, may here be given:—\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |                     |         Out.          |         Home.         |\r\n  |                     +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |      Vessels.       |   Date.   |   Time.   |   Date.   |   Time.   |\r\n  +---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |                     |           | D.

Accordingly, in\r\nthe autumn of 1880, specifications were issued to some of the leading\r\nshipbuilding firms, asking them to tender for the construction of a\r\nvessel of 500 feet in length, 50 feet beam, and 40 feet depth. At\r\nthe suggestion of Messrs J. & G. Thomson, who were successful in\r\nsecuring the contract for this remarkable vessel, the dimensions were\r\nincreased to 530 feet by 52 feet by 44 feet 9 inches. With these\r\ndimensions, and with mild steel as the constructive material, the new\r\nvessel—the _Servia_—was thereafter proceeded with in Messrs Thomson’s\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe Guion line, not to be left behind, placed the order for a vessel\r\nof the dimensions first proposed for the _Servia_, with Messrs John\r\nElder & Co., but, in order to be faster than the _Servia_, the\r\nweight-carrying was considerably reduced, and the boiler power much\r\nincreased. The wisdom of this step has been justified by the now\r\ngenerally received opinion that these fast steamers should not carry\r\nsuch heavy cargoes as the slower ones. This new vessel for the Guion\r\nline was the _Alaska_, now justly noted for her fast runs across the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Inman Company also decided not to lag behind, and as soon as\r\nthe conditions of the design of the _Servia_ had been fixed, they\r\nplaced the order for a ship—the _City of Rome_—with the Barrow\r\nShipbuilding Company, intended to be larger, finer, and faster.\r\nExpectations as to speed and carrying powers were not in her\r\ncase fulfilled, and the result of the dissatisfaction which this\r\noccasioned, was, that the _City of Rome_ changed ownership, Messrs\r\nHenderson Brothers, of Anchor Line fame, coming into possession.\r\nIn the hands of its new owners, the _City of Rome_ was re-arranged\r\ninternally, and her boiler power was considerably augmented, while\r\nher engines also were thoroughly revised. When first built, the\r\nvessel was fitted with engines of 8500 horse-power. As revised, they\r\nindicate 12,000 the acquisition being largely due to the fitting of\r\nfour additional boilers. The results which have accrued from the\r\nextensive alterations made are such as to have firmly established the\r\nvessel in a foremost place in the Atlantic service.\r\n\r\nThe performances of the vessels named have been the subject of\r\nconsiderable interest to all concerned in shipping affairs, and\r\nto the public generally. The following table of fast passages\r\naccomplished during the past two years by these vessels has been\r\ncompiled from published records, and from information supplied by the\r\nshipowning companies:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+----------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |                 |         Out.         |        Home.        |\r\n  |                 +------------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |Names of Vessels.|   Date.    |  Time.  |   Date.   |  Time.  |\r\n  +-----------------+------------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |                 |            | D.

An untoward and serious accident to her machinery laid\r\nthe _Aurania_ aside just as her capabilities in actual service were\r\nbeing shown. It is during the “passenger season” that the qualities\r\nof these transatlantic steamers are best brought out, and it remains\r\nwith the season which has just begun, to demonstrate to the full the\r\n_Aurania’s_ powers.\r\n\r\nA similar remark applies to the _Oregon_, a still more recent\r\ncompetitor from the same stocks as the _Alaska_, whose dimensions\r\ncorrespond with those of the _Alaska_, except in respect to breadth,\r\nthe first-named vessel having 3-ft. 6-in. more beam than the latter,\r\nthe figures being—length over all, 520-ft.; breadth, 54-ft.; depth,\r\n40-ft. 9-in. Extra power of engines to the extent of nearly 3000\r\nhorses indicated has been fitted in the _Oregon_. On the occasion\r\nof her speed trial on the Clyde she ran the distance between Ailsa\r\nCraig and Cumbrae Head—-29½ nautical miles—in 1 hour 20 minutes, or\r\nabout equal to 20 knots per hour. This was attained with the engines\r\nindicating 12,382 horse-power and making 62 revolutions per minute,\r\nthe steam pressure being 110-lbs. per square inch. This result was\r\ndoubtless attained under conditions more favourable to speed than the\r\nvessel is, as a rule, likely to meet with in actual service; and, as\r\nhas been indicated, it still remains with the future to determine\r\nhow far the aims of the owners and builders of the _Oregon_ are\r\nrealised.[1]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _America_, launched from the yard of Messrs J. & G. Thomson,\r\nnear the close of 1883, and presently being fitted for sea, the\r\nNational Steamship Company (Limited), of Liverpool, have embodied\r\nthe results of their careful study of the development and changes in\r\nthe mode of conducting the American trade. From such experiments—for\r\nthey can hardly be considered anything else—as the rapid passages\r\nof the _Alaska_, the _City of Rome_, and other “greyhounds of the\r\nAtlantic,” the company see it is no longer possible or profitable\r\nto have “composite” vessels—_i.e._, those intended to carry a large\r\ncargo as well as passengers,—but that practically one class of\r\nvessels must be built for the passenger traffic and another for\r\nthe conveyance of cargo. The vessel represents an attempt to solve\r\nthe problem of producing a ship which shall have large passenger\r\naccommodation and a high speed, with a comparatively small first cost\r\nand a reasonable consumption of coal. She is built of steel, and\r\nof the following dimensions:—Length, 440 feet; breadth, 51¼ feet;\r\ndepth of hold, 36 feet; gross tonnage, about 6,000 tons. Her engines\r\nare of the inverted three-cylinder type, the high pressure cylinder\r\nbeing 63-ins. diameter, the two low pressure cylinders being 91-ins.\r\neach, while the piston stroke is 66-ins. Six double ended boilers\r\nand one single ended, having in all 39 furnaces, are fitted. The\r\npower expected to be developed is about 9,000 indicated. The speed\r\nguaranteed by the builders of the _America_ is 18 knots an hour, and\r\nconfidence is entertained by all concerned as to this result being\r\nattained.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident, notwithstanding what has already been\r\nachieved, that the brisk competition among transatlantic companies\r\nfor the “fastest steamer afloat” has not yet exhausted itself. The\r\ndetermination some time ago publicly expressed by Mr John Burns, the\r\nable chairman of the Cunard Company, to maintain a leading position,\r\nhas since taken decidedly active shape in the contract entered into\r\nand now being carried out by Messrs John Elder & Co.: that is, the\r\nconstruction of the two huge and powerful steamers of unprecedented\r\nspeed, already referred to near the beginning of this work. They are\r\neach of 8000 tons burthen, 500 feet in length, 57 feet broad, by 40\r\nfeet depth of hold. Engines of 13,000 horse-power will be provided,\r\nwhich, it is computed, will drive the vessels at a speed of 19 knots\r\nan hour. With the establishment of these remarkable steamships in\r\nthis most important service, the prospect is near of a transatlantic\r\npassage lasting only six days, if not indeed considerably under that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nCommunication with our South African colonies is another service in\r\nwhich modern progress, as regards high speed, has been conspicuously\r\nmanifest. The steamers engaged in this service—belonging to the Union\r\nSteamship Coy. and Messrs Donald Currie & Co.—had special attention\r\ndirected towards their powers as to fast steaming were exerted to\r\nthe utmost them during the Zulu War of 1879, at which juncture in\r\nthe transport of our soldiery. In the autumn of 1878 the _Pretoria_,\r\nbelonging to the Union Coy., made the outward passage to the Cape,\r\n_via_ Maderia, in 18 days, 16 hours, including 4½ hours detention.\r\nThe passage home was made in the autumn of 1879 by the same vessel\r\nin 18 days, 13¼ hours, including about 5¾ hours stoppages. These\r\npassages are fairly representative of the best performances of the\r\nvessels engaged in this service, and they have not since been much\r\nexcelled. In midsummer, 1880, the _Durban_, another of the Union Line\r\nvessels, accomplished the homeward run _via_ Maderia in 18 days, 9\r\nhours, including about 6½ hours stoppages. The _Drummond Castle_,\r\nbelonging to Messrs Donald Currie & Co.’s Castle Packet line, has\r\nmade the homeward run in 18 days, 18 hours, or, excluding detentions,\r\nin 18 days, 13 hours. The _Hawarden Castle_, of the same line, has\r\nmade the fastest outward run on record. In the autumn of 1883 she\r\naccomplished it in 18 days, 15 hours, including five hours detention\r\nat Maderia, leaving the actual steaming time 18 days, 10 hours. The\r\ndistance traversed by vessels on this service is some 6,000 miles,\r\nand the average speed attained is about 13 knots per hour. In the\r\ncase of one of the Union Coy.’s vessels, the average speed attained\r\nhas been as high as 13·8 knots per hour over the greater portion of\r\nthe voyage, the indicated horse-power developed being about 2,570,\r\nand the consumpt of coal about 52½ tons per day. For a considerable\r\ntime recently the Companies have found it more remunerative to drive\r\ntheir vessels at moderate speed, but in times of emergency, such\r\nas the outbreak of hostilities in our colonies, their qualities as\r\ntransports traversing long distances at high speed are eminently\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe employment of steamships in long voyages and at high rates of\r\nspeed, for which, not so long ago, it was generally supposed sailing\r\nships were only adapted, has been eminently successful. By the\r\nopening of the Suez Canal the passage to China was shortened from\r\nabout 13,500 miles to about 9800 miles, that to India from over\r\n10,000 miles to 6000. Although steamers were running to China _via_\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, before the opening of the Canal, and doing the\r\nservice most admirably, it is subsequent to that great change, and\r\nindeed quite recently that the most noteworthy advances have been\r\nmade in shortening the time occupied on these important services.\r\nThe passage is now made by steamers under ordinary circumstances in\r\nless than thirty days, which sailing ships under the most favourable\r\nconditions took three and a half to four months to accomplish. The\r\naverage speed attained by the steamers prior to the short route never\r\nexceeded ten knots; steamers now frequently average twelve knots over\r\nthe whole distance, except during their passage through the Canal.\r\n\r\nThe _Stirling Castle_, built in 1882 by Messrs Elder & Co., for\r\nMessrs Skinner & Co.’s China fleet, attained a speed of 18·4 knots on\r\nher official trial. During 1883 she proved herself to be the fleetest\r\nvessel ever engaged in the China tea-carrying trade, arriving in the\r\nThames several days ahead of the China mails, although the latter\r\ncame part of the way overland. The run from Woosung to London was\r\nmade in 27 days 4 hours steaming time. Other vessels belonging to\r\nthis Company, and vessels of the other lines on this important\r\nservice, although not equalling the performances of the _Stirling\r\nCastle_, are exemplifying almost daily the immense superiority of\r\nsteamers over sailing ships for regularity and despatch in long\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nAs the distance to Australia—_i.e._, some 12,000 miles as ordinarily\r\ntaken—is only about 900 miles less _via_ the Suez Canal than by the\r\nCape of Good Hope, steamers are employed on both routes. On the 12th\r\nMay, 1875, the _St. Osyth_ left Plymouth for Melbourne _via_ the\r\nCape, called at St. Vincent for coal, and thence steamed continuously\r\nto Melbourne, reaching her destination on the 27th June. Her full\r\nsteaming time was about 43½ days, the average speed attained being\r\nover 11½ knots per hour. This passage, although considered most\r\nremarkable at the time, has since been surpassed. The _Lusitania_,\r\nof the Orient line, in 1877 made the passage to Melbourne in 40¼\r\ndays, including a detention of 1¼ days at St. Vincent while coaling.\r\nHer actual steaming time was almost exactly 39 days, her average\r\nspeed being only a trifle under 13 knots. The _Cuzco_, of the same\r\nline, during the summer of 1879, made the homeward passage from\r\nAdelaide to Plymouth in 37 days 11 hours, including all detentions.\r\nIn the _Orient_, which was the first vessel specially designed\r\nand constructed for the Australian direct steam service, a most\r\nnoteworthy step in advance was made. She was launched in September,\r\n1879, from the yard of Messrs Elder & Co., and on her completion was\r\ntried for speed, when she attained a maximum average speed of 17\r\nknots per hour. She has made the passage from Plymouth to Adelaide,\r\n_via_ Suez Canal, in 35 days 16 hours, and the same voyage _via_ Cape\r\nof Good Hope in 34 days, 1 hour, steaming time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.S.

While coaling at her moorings in Sydney harbour by night,\r\nthe water was allowed to flow into the ship through her after coal\r\nports, carelessly left open and unwatched, and she thus gradually\r\nfilled, and sank to the bottom. She has since been raised, brought\r\nhome, and restored to her pristine splendour. She is presently\r\nengaged in the express service of the Anchor Line between Liverpool\r\nand New York, her performances being such as should gratify all\r\nconcerned. The _Austral_ on her trial attained a speed of 17·3 knots,\r\nand has made the passage from Plymouth to Melbourne, _via_ the\r\nSuez Canal, in the unprecedented time of 32 days, 14 hours steaming.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently the only direct communication with New Zealand\r\nhas been by sailing vessels, but the New Zealand Shipping Company\r\n(Limited) and the Shaw, Savill, & Albion Company (Limited) are at\r\nthe present moment in the thick of organising monthly services of\r\nhigh-class modern steamships to the Antipodes. The former Company in\r\n1883 despatched the _Ionic_, which they had chartered, with other\r\nof the White Star steamships, for the purpose. This vessel made the\r\npassage out to New Zealand in 43 days, and home in 45 days, including\r\nstoppage for coaling. Passages of a similar character have been\r\nmade by this vessel and others of the Company’s own fleet, three of\r\nwhich—the _Tongariro_, _Aorangi_, and _Ruapehu_—are splendid new\r\nsteel vessels from the stocks of the famous Fairfield yard. The\r\nvessel last named has just made the passage home from Lyttelton, New\r\nZealand, to Plymouth, in the marvellously short period of 37 days,\r\n20 hours, 40 minutes, steaming time; the time, with detentions,\r\nbeing about 39 days. The other Company referred to are having\r\ntwo magnificent steel vessels built by Messrs Denny & Bros., of\r\nDumbarton, to be named the _Arawa_ and _Tainui_, each of 5000 tons\r\ngross. These vessels are to maintain a sea speed of 12½ knots, the\r\nengines to be fitted representing a noteworthy advance in the line of\r\neconomical consumpt of fuel with prolonged terms of steaming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween 1875 and 1882 the number of steamers having ocean speeds of\r\n13 knots and upwards, increased from twenty-five to sixty-five. Of\r\nthese there were only ten—previous to 1875—of 14 knots speed and\r\nupwards, whereas at the beginning of 1882 there were twenty-five of\r\nthis character. During the years 1882 and 1883 alone the increase\r\nin the number of such vessels has been almost double that for the\r\nprevious period named. The highest speed previous to 1875 did not\r\nexceed 15 knots, now there are numerous vessels with speeds exceeding\r\n17 knots, several even approaching 18 knots, while in one or two\r\ncases the speed attained—under favourable circumstances probably—is\r\nstated to have been considerably over 18 knots, the Guion Liner\r\n_Oregon_, indeed, reaching the round figure of 20 knots.\r\n\r\nViewed purely from the point of view of the sea voyager, such results\r\nare alike remarkable and gratifying, whilst considered in their\r\ntechnical and commercial aspects they also call for admiration. It\r\nis questioned, however, whether in most cases the attainment of\r\ngreat speed has been accompanied with corresponding or proportionate\r\nadvance in other matters with which vital progress is concerned.\r\nCommercially, it is of the utmost importance that increase of speed\r\nand power should be achieved, with the least possible weight of\r\nmachinery, water, and fuel to be carried; with the least possible\r\nexpenditure of fuel; with safety and efficiency in working; with low\r\nwear and tear, and cheapness of maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the ship and machinery in fulfilling the various\r\nand often conflicting conditions of economical service is a matter\r\nwith which the naval architect and the marine engineer have jointly\r\nto deal. Where the conditions cannot all be equally satisfied, it is\r\nthe province of these two to make that sort of compromise which gives\r\nthe best results in each special case. In cargo-carrying vessels,\r\nfor example, an economy in the consumption of fuel may often be the\r\ndominant and regulating quality. An economy of one-fourth of a pound\r\nper horse-power per hour gives, on a large transatlantic steamer, a\r\nsaving of about 100 tons of coal for a single voyage. To this saving\r\nof cost is to be added the gain in wages and sustenance of the labour\r\nrequired to handle that coal, and the gain by 100 tons of freight\r\ncarried in place of the coal. Again, it is estimated that every ton\r\nof dead-weight capacity is worth on an average £10 per annum as\r\nearning freight. Supposing, therefore, the weight of machinery and\r\nwater in any ordinary vessel to be 300 tons, and that by careful\r\ndesign and judicious use of materials the engineer can reduce it\r\nby 100 tons without increasing the cost of working, he makes the\r\nvessel worth £1,000 per annum more to her owners. To these and other\r\nsuch considerations, which often influence the naval architect and\r\nengineer in their designs, and due regard to one or more of which not\r\ninfrequently prevents the attainment of all-round success, should be\r\nadded many others concerned with the after-management of vessels. For\r\nexample, the length of voyage to be performed, the seasons and the\r\nmarkets in particular trades, the number of ports of call, and the\r\ncoaling facilities at each, are all matters which must be taken into\r\nconsideration when measuring, from one standpoint or from particular\r\ninstances, the degree of success attained in general.\r\n\r\nThe diminution in coal consumpt, coincident with the increase of\r\nsteam pressure and the acceleration in speed which has been attained\r\nin recent years measures the principal element of progress. In many\r\nof the “racers” of recent times, it is true, speed is attained at\r\nwhat may appear a great sacrifice of fuel, but these are cases\r\nin which the commercial considerations often used to measure the\r\nefficiency of ordinary cargo-carrying steamers are not applicable.\r\nOwners—of transatlantic steamships especially—realise from experience\r\nthat “speed pays,” and they find it of more advantage to ensure\r\ncertainty of arrival at the port of destination than to save a few\r\ntons of coals on the voyage.\r\n\r\nDuring the past sixteen years or so the advance made in respect to\r\nthe reduced ratio of fuel consumed to power developed has indeed\r\nbeen considerable. Before the period stated a vessel of say 700 tons\r\ncarrying capability was not only much slower than the present-day\r\nvessels but the coal supply amounted to about 16 tons per day of\r\n24 hours, whereas vessels are now being built of like size which\r\nattain an average speed of 9 knots, the consumpt of coal not being\r\nmore than 6 tons per day. In 1872 the consumption of coal in vessels\r\nwhose engines were worked at a pressure of from 45-lbs. to 65-lbs.\r\nper inch (the latter being then the highest pressure recorded), did\r\nnot exceed 2½-lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour. This indicated\r\nan improvement in the marine engine during the previous decade,\r\nrepresented by a reduction in the consumpt of fuel by more than\r\none-half the amount previously thought indispensable. Since 1872,\r\nthere has been a further reduction in the average consumpt of fuel to\r\nthe extent of 15 or 16 per cent., or in the average from 2⅛-lbs. to\r\nless than 1¾-lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the vessels themselves, mild steel is largely\r\ntaking the place of iron in the construction of marine boilers. The\r\nchange has reduced the weight of this important item of machinery\r\nby about one-tenth, a great advantage in itself, as increasing\r\nthe dead-weight capability of the vessel. The questions as to\r\nthe reliable character of the boilers made of steel with respect\r\nto strength under working, and as regards corrosion, are being\r\npractically answered as time goes on; and, as in the case of ship\r\nstructure, in a way very satisfactory for the new material. There\r\nis every probability that a further advance may soon be made in\r\nconnection with marine boilers, in the way of constructing the\r\nshell in solid rings, thus doing away with the longitudinal seams.\r\nThe strength of boilers is of course governed by the strength of\r\nthe seam, and this is never above 75 per cent. of the solid plate.\r\nHence, if solid shells are employed, an increase in pressure of about\r\n25 per cent., with the same thickness of shell, may be obtained.\r\nAppliances are now being laid down in the Vulcan Steel and Forge\r\nCoy., Barrow-in-Furness, for this purpose.\r\n\r\nImproved appliances and modes of construction, no less than the\r\nchange of material employed, have played a large part in rendering\r\nthe boilers of modern steamships capable of being worked at the\r\nhigher pressures now common. It is not possible, however, with\r\nthe space at command, to treat of these; nor is it practicable to\r\nconsider or even enumerate all the various improved fittings which in\r\nthe aggregate so materially enhance the efficiency of boilers.\r\n\r\nOne such feature particularly noteworthy because of the success\r\nwith which it has been applied to the boilers of very many modern\r\nhigh-class merchant ships may be shortly referred to. This is the\r\ncorrugated mild steel furnace, manufactured by the Leeds Forge\r\nCompany on Mr Samson Fox’s patent, an illustration of which is given\r\nin Fig. 4. This shows a single corrugated furnace flue, flanged\r\nat the end to meet the tube plate of the boiler. The strength of\r\nthese flues to resist collapse has been proved in the presence\r\nof the officials of the Admiralty, Board of Trade, and Lloyd’s\r\nRegister, to be, on the average, four times greater than a plain\r\nflue of the same dimensions. An immediate effect of this has been to\r\nincrease their average diameter from 3-ft. to 4-ft., the thickness\r\nof plate-½-inch—remaining the same; a result as to diameter and\r\nthickness quite impracticable with ordinary furnaces. Some have even\r\nbeen made to carry 170-lbs. per square inch of steam pressure, 4-ft.\r\n8-ins. outside diameter constructed of one single plate, with the\r\nweld so arranged as to be below the fire bars in the furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\nTHE LEEDS FORGE C^o LTD]\r\n\r\nBy the corrugated, as against the plain tube, a greatly increased\r\nheating surface is presented to the flame and the heated gases\r\nof the furnace, thus yielding a greatly enhanced evaporative\r\npower, equal to at least 50 per cent. more than in the ordinary\r\nform. Better allowance is made by the corrugated surface for the\r\nexpansion and contraction caused by changes of temperature in\r\nthe furnace, without in any way impairing its efficiency as a\r\nlongitudinal stay for the boiler. Through the increased diameters\r\nand the augmented surface possible by these corrugated tubes, their\r\nadoption lessens the number of furnaces and stokers necessary for\r\nthe horse-power required. As a further consequence, the boiler space\r\nmay be diminished, and an increase effected in the cargo space or\r\nfreight-carrying capacity of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of corrugated flues as compared with plain flues\r\ncannot all be named, but the extraordinary extent to which they are\r\nnow employed in the best class of steamships is the best proof of\r\ntheir superiority. It is stated that if the flues which have been\r\nmade by the Company since their introduction about the beginning\r\nof 1878, and are now at work, were placed in one continuous line,\r\nthey would extend to a length of over twenty miles, representing, in\r\nmarine and other engines, nearly one million horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe number of separate types of boilers introduced into steamships\r\nhas been much increased of recent years—an evidence that engineers\r\nare growingly conscious of the possibilities which may result from\r\nimproved efficiency in this agent of propulsion. One direction in\r\nwhich their efforts at present are being largely put forth, is that\r\nof securing the more complete combustion of fuel in the furnaces.\r\nConsiderable success has already attended the working of boilers\r\nunder forced draught, or the admission of air to the furnaces under\r\npressure. Combined with special types of boilers, it has been\r\naffirmed that nearly 50 per cent. more power has been obtained by\r\nthis means. There is doubtless much to be expected from this system\r\nin the future, especially as it may be associated with a change in\r\nthe form or type of boilers by which the number and weight of such\r\nitems will be reduced. The saving of space in the vessel, the economy\r\nin consumption of coal, the reduction in dead-weight of machinery,\r\nare possibilities of the movement now in progress which cannot fail\r\nto effect materially the commercial character of our high-class mail\r\nand passenger steamships, and merchant vessels generally.\r\n\r\nOther directions in which advance has been made during the period\r\nunder review are, considerably higher steam pressures, less heating\r\nsurface, and smaller cylinders, for indicated horse-power developed.\r\nThe various improvements in design and construction which have\r\ncontributed to these results cannot be entered into with any degree\r\nof fulness here. For detailed treatment of these matters, readers\r\nare referred to the papers read by eminent engineering authorities,\r\nbefore the various professional and scientific institutions, a list\r\nof which papers follows the present chapter.[3]\r\n\r\nReduction in the weight of machinery per indicated horse-power\r\ndeveloped is, in general terms, the common line in which engineering\r\neffort lies, and in which no little advance has lately been\r\nmade. Every possible opportunity of using steel, where it can be\r\nintroduced with safety and efficiency, has been taken advantage\r\nof. Hollow crank steel shafts and propeller shafting in place of\r\nsolid shafting; propellers and pistons of cast steel in place of\r\niron; and boilers of mild steel plates, are a few of the directions\r\nin which large weight-savings have been effected. That there is\r\nstill great room for improvement in this direction is shown by the\r\nfollowing statement, given by Mr F. C. Marshall, of Messrs R. & W.\r\nHawthorn, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in his valuable paper read before the\r\nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers in 1883. The figures given show\r\nfor various classes of vessels the average weight of machinery per\r\nindicated horse-power, in steamships of the merchant marine—and for\r\ncomparison—of the Royal Navy:—\r\n\r\n                                           Lbs. per I.H.P.\r\n\r\n  Merchant Steamers,                             480\r\n  Royal Navy,                                    360\r\n  Royal Navy, fast cruiser _Iris_,               280\r\n  Torpedo Ram, _Polyphemus_,                     180\r\n  Torpedo vessels,                                60\r\n  Ordinary marine boilers, including water,      196\r\n  Locomotive boilers, including water,            60\r\n\r\nThe figures given are for weights of machinery, including engines,\r\nboilers, water, and all fittings ready for sea.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of recent advances in marine\r\nengineering—affording as it does the means of using higher steam\r\npressures than have hitherto been used with economy—is the\r\nintroduction of the triple expansion description of engines already\r\nreferred to. This important departure was begun in 1874, when Mr A.\r\nC. Kirk, of Messrs R. Napier & Sons, designed and fitted on board the\r\nscrew-steamer _Propontis_, built for Mr W. H. Dixon, of Liverpool,\r\nby Messrs Elder & Co.—with whom Mr Kirk at that time was engineering\r\nmanager—engines involving the principle of triple expansion and\r\nabnormally high pressure of steam. In 1877 the principle received\r\nfurther practical development on board the _Isa_, a pleasure yacht\r\nfitted with triple expansion engines, designed in 1876 by Mr\r\nAlexander Taylor, consulting engineer of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who has\r\nsubsequently designed several other engines of the same type for\r\nlarger merchant steamers.\r\n\r\nAs not infrequently happens in connection with inventions,\r\nseveral minds were occupied, and independent ideas matured almost\r\nsimultaneously, in the matter of triple expansion engines. Mr\r\nKirk had secured the patent for engines involving this principle\r\nsubsequent to, but before he was made cognisant of, Mr Taylor’s work.\r\nAt the same time he learned that in quite another quarter the designs\r\nfor such a type of engine had already been perfected. Mr Kirk, on\r\nhearing these facts, relinquished the patent rights he had secured.\r\nNotwithstanding this, it is to the success of the engines designed\r\nby Mr Kirk, and fitted by his firm on board the screw-steamer\r\n_Aberdeen_, that the recent development of the system is largely due.\r\nThis vessel was built in 1881 for the Australian service of Messrs\r\nG. Thomson & Co., London and Aberdeen, and measures 350 feet by 44\r\nfeet by 33 feet. Her engines work at a boiler pressure of 125 lbs.\r\nper square inch. The three cylinders are respectively 30 inches, 45\r\ninches, and 70 inches in diameter, and the stroke is 4 feet 6 inches.\r\nThe smallest is the high pressure cylinder, into which the steam is\r\nfirst admitted; from thence it passes, after expansion, into the\r\nsecond or intermediate cylinder; after still further expansion\r\nit passes into the third or low pressure cylinder, from whence, after\r\nthe expansion is completed, it is discharged into the condenser.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Aberdeen_ was completed, 2,000 tons of dead-weight were\r\nput on board, and the consumption was tested on a four hours’ run\r\nat 1,800 horse-power. The result was the consumption at the rate of\r\n1.28-lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour, with Penrikyber Welsh\r\ncoal. From this the designer of the engine inferred a sea consumption\r\nof good Welsh coal at the rate of 1·5 to 1·6-lbs. per indicated\r\nhorse-power. The maximum measured mile speed was 13·74 knots, with\r\n2,631 indicated horse-power, and a consumption of 1 ton 17 cwt. per\r\nhour. The vessel started from Plymouth on 1st April, 1881, upon her\r\nfirst voyage to Melbourne, with 4000 tons of coals and cargo—weight\r\nand measurement—on board. She arrived at Cape Town on the 23rd April,\r\nhaving accomplished the distance—5,890 miles—in 22 days. After taking\r\nin about 140 tons of coal, she left for Melbourne on the 24th, and\r\narrived there on the 14th May, in 20 days. The whole time occupied\r\nin steaming from Plymouth to Melbourne was, therefore, 42 days. Her\r\naverage indicated horse-power on the voyage has been about 1,880, and\r\nthe consumption less than thirty-four tons per day, or at the rate\r\nof about 1·69-lbs. per indicated horse-power over the whole voyage.\r\nSince these results were obtained, Messrs Napier have fitted three\r\nsets of 5000 H.P. triple expansion engines into vessels built for the\r\nCompania Transatlantica Mexicana, and are completing a duplicate of\r\nthe _Aberdeen_.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Messrs Denny & Coy., Dumbarton, are at present making\r\nengines of the triple expansion type for the new steamers of the\r\nShaw, Savill & Albion Company’s direct New Zealand service. There are\r\nfour cylinders and two cranks, the cylinders being arranged in pairs,\r\ntandem fashion, the small on the top of the large. Expansion takes\r\nplace in three stages, the first small cylinder taking steam from the\r\nboilers about five-eights of the stroke, and expanding into the valve\r\nchest of the second small cylinder, where it is further expanded.\r\nFrom thence it exhausts into the valve chest common to both the large\r\ncylinders described. The steam to be supplied to these engines is to\r\nhave a pressure of 160-lbs. per square inch, the highest yet carried\r\nin marine engines. These instances of actual advancement, taken in\r\nconjunction with the favourable light in which the triple expansion\r\nprinciple is regarded by our foremost marine engineers, augur well\r\nfor the future of steamship propulsion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe activity characterising merchant ship construction, and\r\nespecially the enormous increase in their dimensions and speed within\r\nrecent years, have necessarily led to speculation with regard to what\r\nform the ship of the future will take. There have not been wanting,\r\nindeed, actual propositions and elaborately prepared designs of\r\nwhat the ideal ship should be. A company was sometime ago formed in\r\nWashington, U.S., to have three vessels built of a novel type, the\r\npatented invention of Captain Lundborg, a Swedish engineer, intended\r\nto make the Atlantic passage in five days. It was also announced that\r\nthe order for their construction had actually been given out, but\r\nthis is wanting in confirmation. Great expectations were entertained\r\nin America regarding what was termed the dome-ship _Meteor_, built\r\non the Hudson in the early part of 1883 from the designs of Captain\r\nBleven. A company had been formed under the designation of the\r\n“American Quick Transit Company,” the chief supporters being Boston\r\nmerchants, to build several large steamships on the proposed lines,\r\nbut the utter failure of the _Meteor_ to answer the promises of her\r\ninventor has relegated the scheme to the vast limbo of unfulfilled\r\nAmerican projects. Three years ago or more, scientific journals gave\r\npublicity to a scheme of “Ocean Palace” steamship, patented by Mr\r\nRobert Wilcox, of Melbourne, Victoria, the claims for which ranked\r\nthemselves under the heads of speed, safety, and comfort. Double\r\nhulls, as in the case of some Channel steamers, were employed, but\r\neach of the hulls was divided into two cigar-shaped portions, thus\r\ngiving to the submerged whole, a quadruplicate character, and which,\r\nwith its palatial superstructure, was apt to remind one—shall it be\r\nsaid?—of Rome and her seven hills, or Venice and her island base!\r\nThe design, nevertheless, was to give the least resistance with the\r\ngreatest buoyancy and stability. The method of propulsion proposed\r\nby Mr Wilcox was also novel. He placed a couple of enormous drums\r\nfore and aft (between the hulls), which were to be driven by the\r\nengines as if they were paddle-wheels. Over these drums was placed\r\na continuous band of iron links, upon which, at suitable intervals,\r\npaddles or blades were fixed. A comparatively low speed of engine was\r\nto give a high speed of velocity to this band of blades; and as there\r\nwould be twenty-one paddles, all immersed at the same time, their\r\ngrip of the water was to be such that there should be little slip.\r\nWhether on a serious application of the principles involved in this\r\ninvention to a ship for the Australian service the voyage would have\r\nbeen made, as was claimed, in 26 days, equal to an increase in speed\r\nof 75 per cent., has never of course been determined! Still another\r\nscheme, and one which the inventor has been encouraged to prosecute\r\nby the recommendations of eminent authorities on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, is that of Captain Coppin, noted for his success in salvage\r\noperations, which consists of an “Ocean Ferry” partaking as to form\r\nsomewhat of the features above described for Mr Wilcox’s “Ocean\r\nPalace.” The speed said to be possible by Captain Coppin’s vessel is\r\ntwenty knots an hour, and the terminal ports proposed are Milford\r\nHaven and New York. It was announced some time ago that M. Raoul\r\nPictet, the eminent engineer of Geneva, was engaged upon the question\r\nof ship design and propulsion, and was in hopes that by application\r\nof his ideas he might yet send ships careering over the sea at the\r\nrate of thirty-seven miles an hour!\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that there is no lack of inventive\r\neffort being put forth towards a realization of the ideal ships of\r\nthe future. In a service, however, like that of the Atlantic, where\r\ncompetition is strong and keen, and where the monetary issues are\r\nneatly adjusted between rival companies, there is little chance of\r\nany of the various projects being tried. An impression exists among\r\nshipowners—for which doubtless there are sufficient grounds—that\r\ntime and capital staked on novelties or “new departures” are simply\r\ninvitations to defeat in the race or to absolute ruin itself. This\r\ncommercial prudence and industrial caution has been startled in\r\nseveral ways of recent years—_e.g._, by meteoric flashes such as\r\nthe _Livadia_ and _Meteor_—the ultimate effect of which has been to\r\nillumine and make clearer the probable line of advancement.\r\n\r\nBy pretty general consent of those most competent to judge the\r\nships of the immediate future will possess the broad distinctions\r\nof being either purely passenger or purely cargo-carrying mediums.\r\nIt is equally agreed that twin in place of single screw propellers\r\nwill be employed, and that for the express ships nothing less than\r\n20 knots per hour will be considered satisfactory. On a subject,\r\nhowever, concerned not with historical facts, but with theories and\r\nscientific forecasts, it may be well not to enlarge, especially\r\nas the future is evidently charged with possibilities of which\r\npresent-day designers can have but indefinite notions. The subject\r\nof employing electrical energy as the propulsive power on board ship\r\nis at the present time engaging serious attention, but the degree of\r\npractical and commercial success attained does not, as yet, warrant\r\nany anticipation of its immediate application to vessels beyond small\r\ncraft, such as launches and ferries. In the midst, however, of such\r\nimmense and marvellous works achieved by this great—and, in some\r\nsenses, modern—force, it would be both idle and unwise to keep out of\r\nview the possibilities of its future as affecting ship propulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Papers and Lectures bearing on the speed and propulsive power\r\nof modern steamships, to which readers desiring fuller acquaintance\r\nwith the _technique_ and details of the subject are referred:—\r\n\r\n  ON THE BOILERS AND ENGINES OF OUR FUTURE FLEET, by Mr J.

The qualities of safety and comfort, even more than\r\nincrease of speed and the consequent shortening of sea passages, are\r\nfirst essentials in the realisation of this great end. The structural\r\nmodifications, and the great development in size of recent vessels,\r\naffect the qualities named in ways which already may have been made\r\nevident, but which call for more detailed treatment. The more minute\r\nwatertight sub-division of the hulls of vessels, for instance, and\r\nespecially the presence of an inner skin or cellular bottom, are\r\nmarked accessions to their safety.\r\n\r\nThe primary object and ruling principle of all proper watertight\r\nsub-division, is so to limit the space to which water can find\r\naccess, that in a vessel with one, or even two, compartments open\r\nto the sea, the accession of weight due to the filling of these\r\ncompartments would not exceed the surplus buoyancy she should\r\npossess. Until within recent years this was not so fully regarded as\r\nit ought, owing chiefly to the objections of shipowners to minute\r\nsub-division, as impairing a vessel’s usefulness and capacity for\r\nstowage of miscellaneous cargo. These objections have still doubtless\r\nmuch weight for vessels in certain trades, but the tendency of\r\nmodern passenger traffic to estrange itself from cargo-carrying\r\nmediums, makes them almost inapplicable to a large section of our\r\nmercantile marine. There is now, indeed, more faith in well divided\r\nships generally as being in the long run no less efficient and more\r\neconomical than scantily divided ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe salutary influence exerted by the Admiralty, in stipulating for\r\nincreased sub-division of the hulls of all merchant vessels eligible\r\nfor state employment in times of war, worthy of special recognition.\r\nA few years ago only thirty or forty large steamers in the merchant\r\nnavy were so constructed, as regards sub-division, that they would\r\nhave survived for a few minutes the effect of collision with other\r\nvessels or of grounding on rocks. Within recent years—greatly owing\r\nto the stipulations referred to, and to the desire f shipowners to\r\ncomply with them for the reasons given—there are few, if any, of the\r\nmany first-class mail steamers turned out, not so constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nMuch valuable information on the subject was given in a paper on\r\n“Bulkheads,” read before the Institution of Naval Architects in\r\nMarch, 1883, by Mr James Dunn, of the Admiralty, whose experience in\r\nmatters relating to the qualification of merchant ships for State\r\nemployment eminently entitles him to be considered an authority.\r\nFrom diagrams contained in the paper, the effects of good and of\r\ninefficient sub-division of vessels are well illustrated. Figs. 5 to\r\n8 in the present work represent some of these. They are concerned\r\nwith two vessels, in one of which—an actual case—the bulkheads were\r\nwell placed and cared for, and carried to a reasonable height as\r\nshown in Fig. 5; the result of a collision proving that under such\r\nconditions they were of immeasurable value, while in the other\r\nvessel, although having the same number and a similar disposition\r\nof bulkheads, their presence is rendered valueless by their being\r\nstopped at or about the water-line, as indicated in Fig. 7. In the\r\nfirst case, a steamer of nearly 5,000 tons, during a fog, ran into\r\nthe vessel represented by Fig. 5 and 6, striking her abreast of No. 3\r\nbulkhead, and opening up two compartments to the sea. The bulkheads,\r\nhowever, as has been said, were carried to a reasonable height,\r\nand the water could not get beyond them—they stood the test—the\r\nvessel did not sink, but kept afloat at the trim shown in Fig. 6,\r\nand in this condition steamed 300 miles safely into port. The second\r\ncase—though a suppositionary one merely, yet representative of not\r\na few merchant steamers now afloat—would not be attended with like\r\nresults should such an accident happen as has been described. In\r\nvessels so bulkheaded, the water not being confined to the two holds,\r\nnumbered 2 and 3, as it was in the previous actual case, would pour\r\nover the top of the dwarf bulkhead into the foremost hold, and the\r\nship would soon assume the position indicated in Fig, 8: one not at\r\nall favourable, as may be readily believed, for the completion of a\r\nvoyage to port.\r\n\r\nThese cases illustrate the value of minute and careful sub-division\r\nof the hulls of vessels by watertight bulkheads. Unless, however, the\r\nbulkheads are carried a few feet higher than the level of the water\r\noutside—and it is to be regretted that this is still not infrequently\r\noverlooked or neglected in merchant steamers—they are valueless, and,\r\nindeed, had better not be in the ship at all. They will contribute to\r\nthe loss of the vessel by keeping the water at one end, and carrying\r\nher bows under, whereas if they are not fitted, the same volume of\r\nwater will distribute itself throughout the bottom of the ship fore\r\nand aft, preserve the even trim of the vessel, and allow more pumps\r\nto cope with the inflow. Although her freeboard, or height of side\r\nabove water will be reduced, she will still be seaworthy, the boiler\r\nfires may be kept burning, and the machinery going, sufficiently\r\nlong for her to reach a port of safety. Readers appreciating the\r\nabove considerations will readily see why it is that sailing vessels\r\nare usually fitted with only one transverse bulkhead—that near the\r\nbow—and understand how it is that the outcry sometimes made by\r\ninexperienced people about the absence of other bulkheads in emigrant\r\nsailing vessels is for most part unheeded by those on whom the\r\nresponsibility falls.\r\n\r\nFrom statistics presented in the paper above referred to, it is shown\r\nthat during a period of six years, ending with December, 1882, the\r\naverage loss per annum of ships not qualified for the Admiralty\r\nlist was one in twenty-five; while of ships so qualified the annual\r\naverage loss was only one in eighty-six. The chances of loss from\r\nany cause are thus seen to be nearly four times as great for a ship\r\nnot constructed to qualify for the Admiralty list as for a vessel\r\nentered on that list. During the first four-and-a-half years of\r\nthe period referred to, not one ship of those entered on the list\r\nwas lost by collision although a considerable number had been in\r\ncollision, and escaped foundering by reason of the safety afforded\r\nby their bulkheads. During 1882 six casualties happened to ships on\r\nthe list, one of which—a case of collision—proved fatal. This was a\r\ncase, however, such as no merchant steamer afloat at the time would\r\nhave been capable of surviving. The whole of the ship—a small one—was\r\nflooded abaft the engine-room, the two after holds being open to\r\nthe sea. The whole of the losses from the Admiralty list during the\r\nperiod referred to—eleven in number—have been from drifting on rocks,\r\nor otherwise getting fixed on shore, with the solitary exception\r\nabove quoted. In the same period 76 ships have been lost which had\r\nbeen offered for admission to the list, but had not been found\r\nqualified; of these 17, or 22½ per cent., were lost by collision;\r\nand 10, or 13¼ per cent., were lost by foundering; most of the rest\r\nstranded or broke up on rocks. The risk of fatal collision, according\r\nto Mr Dunn, is about 1 to 100, irrespective of the class of ship, and\r\nthe ships on the Admiralty list enjoy almost absolute immunity from\r\nloss by this cause.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing indicates the way in which minute water-tight\r\nsub-division has come to be widely regarded. Much requires yet to\r\nbe done to reach the end desirable, as there are many vessels built\r\nprior to the movement sadly deficient in the qualities concerned. The\r\nbulkhead near the bow—the “collision” bulkhead, as it is termed—has\r\ndone noble service in many cases of collision, and it is with reason\r\nthat its position and structural character in all vessels are subject\r\nto special supervision and made a condition of classification in\r\nthe Registries. Recently it has been made imperative by Lloyd’s\r\nSociety that vessels over 330 feet long should have two additional\r\nwater-tight bulkheads extending to the upper deck, in the holds,\r\nforward and aft of the machinery compartment. The requirements of\r\nthis Registry, it may be said, constitute at once an anticipation and\r\na reflex of the needs of merchant ship construction. In water-tight\r\nsub-division, as in other matters, the Society and its large staff of\r\nable surveyors are “powers which make for” sterling efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe extended adoption of double bottoms is specially contributory\r\nto the safety of vessels in the event of their running over a reef\r\ninto deep water, or in going ashore. Numerous instances are on\r\nrecord of steamships so constructed sustaining damage to the outer\r\nskin, and yet—because of the inner bottom remaining intact and\r\nperfectly water-tight—no serious damage resulting. The case of the\r\n_Great Eastern_ is an early yet notable example. This great vessel\r\nin 1860 ran over a reef of rocks and tore a hole 80 feet long and\r\n10 feet wide in her outer skin, yet, because of this feature in her\r\nconstruction, she was placed in no jeopardy.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it would seem that even the employment of\r\nsteel as the constructive material affords safety to a vessel in\r\ncircumstances which would almost prove fatal to a ship built of iron.\r\nThe remarkable experience which befell the first steel ocean-going\r\nsteamer—the _Rotomahana_, belonging to the Union Steamship Company of\r\nNew Zealand—may here be recounted. While steaming between Auckland\r\nand the Great Barrier Island on New-Year’s-Day, 1880, this vessel\r\nstruck upon and ran over a sunken rock. She had a large party of\r\npleasure seekers on board, and but for the fact that she was built\r\nof such a ductile material as mild steel, the commencement of the\r\nyear 1880 might have been clouded by a catastrophe which would have\r\nspread gloom and sorrow throughout New Zealand, if not over a wider\r\ncircle. At the earliest possible moment the damaged vessel was docked\r\nfor examination. The results are effectively summarised in an extract\r\nfrom a letter referring to the accident, written by the managing\r\ndirector of the Company. He says:—“This experience has clearly shown\r\nthe immense superiority of steel over iron. There is no doubt that\r\nhad the _Rotomahana_ been of iron, such a rent would have been made\r\nin her, that she would have filled in a few minutes.” The starboard\r\nbilge for over 20 feet of its length was more or less indented, one\r\nplate especially being greatly misshapen between two frames. This\r\nplate was removed, hammered, rolled flat again, and replaced—after\r\nthe frames which had been bent inwards by the force of the grounding\r\nhad been straightened. No new material except rivets were required\r\nfor the execution of the repairs. The _Rotomahana_, as if to show her\r\nability to “laugh at all disasters,” has grounded twice subsequently\r\non the rocky and treacherous coast along which she plies, yet has\r\ncome out of the ordeal with immunity from positive danger. Her\r\nremarkable experience may safely be taken as most convincing evidence\r\nof the suitability of mild steel for shipbuilding. Other cases are\r\nnot wanting, however, in which the same thing is exemplified. One\r\nwhich recently astonished everybody concerned with shipping was that\r\nof the _Duke of Westminster_, a vessel 400 feet in length, built of\r\nmild steel by the Barrow Shipbuilding Coy., which lay bumping for a\r\nweek on stony ground near the Isle of Wight, without making a drop\r\nof water. The bottom plating of the _Duke of Westminster_, as she\r\nappeared in dry dock, was corrugated between the frames for more\r\nthan half the length of the vessel, and yet not a single plate was\r\ncracked, nor a rivet started. Another case of an equally striking\r\ncharacter is that of the British India Coy.’s steamer _India_, built\r\nby Messrs Denny, of Dumbarton, which went ashore near the mouth of\r\nthe Thames in December, 1881, and was left high and dry at low water.\r\nHer bottom, although forced up about 3 inches over a length of about\r\n40 feet amidships, did not give way, and the vessel, during the\r\nperiod she was aground, did not make a drop of water.\r\n\r\nAll these are instances of the enhanced safety of ships due to the\r\nemployment of steel, which ought certainly to be recognised by\r\nunderwriters in the way of reduced premiums for vessels constructed\r\nof this material. One consideration which, it is both curious and\r\nsad to say, militates against this result, and which, judging from\r\nviews entertained by shipowners themselves, stands in the way of the\r\nemployment of steel, is not its _inability_ but its very _efficiency_\r\nto withstand the results of grounding or other catastrophe. It is\r\nargued that while the effects of grounding are less _severe_ in the\r\ncase of steel, and do not result in fracture or through-piercing\r\nbecause of its great ductility, yet the amount of _damage requiring\r\nrepair_ is invariably much greater than in the case of iron. This\r\nview of the matter—which virtually places pounds, shillings, and\r\npence before the comfort, if not the very lives, of those on board\r\nship—the author feels bound to say, is not, so far as he knows,\r\nshared by owners of ships engaged in mail and passenger service,\r\nand it cannot surely be entertained by underwriters of any proper\r\ndiscernment.\r\n\r\nSafety in ocean steamships, in so far as affected by design, has\r\nunquestionably received greater attention at the hands of designers\r\nwithin recent years than formerly. The particular directions in\r\nwhich this is evinced, as well as the causes at work in bringing it\r\nabout, will be dealt with in the chapter on scientific progress,\r\nthe object here being to indicate the extent to which the safety\r\nof ships is affected by the qualities of their construction and\r\noutfit. The general question of seaworthiness, affected as it is\r\nby matters almost beyond the province of the marine architect, is\r\nin great measure the care of others concerned. The underwriting\r\nor insurance societies looking to their own interests, the Board\r\nof Trade on behalf of the lieges, and shipowners on their own\r\nand their customers’ and servants’ account, are parties on whom\r\nresponsibility devolves in this connection. The question whether\r\nthey are duly, and at all times alive to such responsibility, is one\r\nvery difficult to answer, and cannot be fully dealt with here. Apart\r\nfrom the question of remissness by these bodies, in what are clearly\r\ntheir special duties, there is great difficulty in apportioning\r\nthe duties and responsibility aright. The Board of Trade have not\r\ninfrequently received checks when with precautionary motives they\r\nhave interfered with departments and in matters but little affecting\r\na vessel’s seaworthiness. The conflict which has so long raged and\r\nstill rages between the Board and the shipowners of Britain regarding\r\nthe loading of vessels, illustrates, and is indeed the result of,\r\nboth difficulties. The Merchant Shipping Bill, introduced by Mr\r\nChamberlain, and in a modified form now before Parliament, will, it\r\nis hoped, furnish a satisfactory solution of the matter. Shipowners\r\nthemselves have too often insisted on exercising functions and\r\ndictating in matters which only may be determined with propriety and\r\nsafety by builders or by competent naval architects.\r\n\r\nThe amount of thorough supervision to which a vessel is subjected\r\nwhile under construction, renders the fear of unseaworthiness, from\r\neither defective construction or equipment, the least reasonable\r\nof all the fears with which ocean navigation is regarded. It is in\r\nlater circumstances, and concerning matters of a more extraneous\r\ncharacter, that the most justifiable fears may be entertained\r\nregarding a vessel’s safety. Overloading, improper stowage, bad\r\nmanagement, under-manning, insufficient repair, besides the numerous\r\ninevitable and unforeseen circumstances incidental to sea-voyaging,\r\nmay be instanced as the causes to which the greatest losses are\r\nattributable.[4] Few instances of loss from structural defects are\r\nadduceable, and even in these, causes of a more or less extraneous\r\ncharacter are associated with the loss. On the other hand, instances\r\ncould be multiplied where vessels sustaining the casualties which\r\nrough weather or rank carelessness make always imminent have come\r\nout of the ordeal with credit to the constructors. One notable case\r\nmay be instanced. The _Arizona_, of the Guion Line, some time after\r\nbeing put on the Atlantic service, while steaming at a speed of 14\r\nknots, and almost in mid-Atlantic, ran into an iceberg of gigantic\r\ndimensions, and notwithstanding that the force of the concussion\r\nsmashed her bows for a length of 20 feet into an unrecognisable mass,\r\nshe kept afloat, and reached a port of safety.\r\n\r\nWhere, as has already been indicated, there is such close oversight\r\nand thorough supervision—where, indeed, the real interests of every\r\nparty honestly concerned lie so clearly in the high qualities of\r\nconstruction—nothing short of such results as the foregoing should be\r\nexpected. The insurance companies, on whom the burden (monetary at\r\nleast) of loss at sea ultimately falls, see it their interest to know\r\nthat those registration societies, on whom they rely for guarantee\r\nas to a vessel’s structural and general efficiency, are themselves\r\nefficient and trustworthy authorities. These societies, known as\r\nLloyd’s, Liverpool Underwriters, and Bureau Veritas, Registries, in\r\nspite of the dread as to business rivalry affecting injuriously their\r\nstandards of classification, have still a high criterion, and enjoy\r\nthe confidence of insurance societies and shipowners alike.\r\n\r\nShipowners themselves, notwithstanding some examples to the contrary,\r\nare, and have always been, anxious and painstaking seekers after\r\nthoroughness; not merely mercenary grubs, sacrificing considerations\r\nof safety to features promising exemption from tonnage or other\r\nregistration dues, and perhaps the extinction of a rival. Some of the\r\nbest British vessels, notably those of the Cunard Line, are unclassed\r\nat the registries, but have been built under private survey. The\r\nwell known boast of the Cunard Company that not a single life has\r\nbeen lost by mishap at sea during their long and extensive service,\r\nis eloquent testimony to the care exercised in the construction and\r\nmanagement of ships. It is the practice of some companies to effect\r\nclassification in two, sometimes three, separate registries, and\r\nthe number of inspectors employed to superintend the work of\r\nconstruction, over and above the surveyors of the registries and\r\nthe overseers of the firms, is in some instances astonishing. The\r\ncrowning case of all is that of the building firms themselves—many\r\nshipbuilders unquestionably being conscientious and thorough to a\r\ndegree which simply mocks this great array of supervision.\r\n\r\nIn the outfit of vessels correspondingly close attention is paid to\r\nthose features, fixed or portable, which contribute to the safety\r\nof the ship and the welfare of passengers. The universal adoption\r\nof steam winches for working cargo enables the pumps communicating\r\nwith the holds to be wrought by steam, through levers attached to\r\nthe barrel ends of the winches. Special donkey-engine pumps, in\r\naddition, are now employed in all the higher class vessels, and\r\nautomatic means of registering the quantity of water in the holds are\r\nbeginning to be introduced. Provision against outbreaks of fire, no\r\nless than against foundering, has been receiving greater attention\r\nthan formerly. Many of the first-class mail steamships are fitted\r\nwith fire-pipes leading to every compartment, and which convey at the\r\nturning of a valve a charge of steam sufficient to extinguish the\r\nmost serious outbreak. Lowering and detaching gear for life-boats is\r\nnow a necessary part of every first-class steamer’s equipment. Over a\r\ndozen different apparatuses for effecting this very important purpose\r\nare at present in the market, some of which are admirably adapted for\r\nsafe and speedy working, even in the hurry and panic which too often\r\naccompanies cases of shipwreck.\r\n\r\nImportant as these devices are for saving life and property in event\r\nof casualty, the appliances which contribute to the prevention of\r\ncasualty at all, are perhaps more so. This is a gradually increasing\r\nand improving element in ships’ outfit. Conspicuous among this class\r\nof articles are navigational instruments, and of these perhaps the\r\nmost noteworthy are the instruments with which the name of Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson is associated, although many others, in use or\r\nawaiting adoption, and designed for equally important purposes, might\r\nbe referred to, did space permit.\r\n\r\nWithin the period covered by this review, this eminent inventor has\r\nintroduced an instrument which enables soundings to be taken while\r\nvessels are going at full speed, at depths of 100 fathoms and under.\r\nThe sounding line adopted is a fine steel wire, such as is used by\r\npianoforte makers, which passes through the water with very little\r\nresistance, and can be sent to the bottom by a light weight or\r\nsinker, even when the ship is going full speed. Fastened to a short\r\nlength of rope, near the sinker, there is a brass tube, in which is\r\nplaced a glass tube two feet long, closed at one end and open at the\r\nother. This glass tube is coated inside with chromate of silver. As\r\nthe sinker goes down, the air in the tube becomes compressed, and\r\nsea water rises up inside, the height to which it rises depending on\r\nthe depth, from the surface, to which the glass tube goes down. As\r\nthe sea water rises in the tube, the salt of the water acts on the\r\nchromate of silver and changes the colour from red to white; thus a\r\nmark is left on the glass tube showing the height to which the sea\r\nwater rises, from which the actual depth may be at once measured\r\nby a prepared scale. By means of this sounding machine a ship can\r\nfeel her way round a coast in a fog without reducing speed. In later\r\ninstruments the inventor has devised another form of automatic gauge,\r\nwhich obviates the use of glass tubes, and is a decided improvement\r\non the gauge here described.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Improved Mariner’s Compass introduced by Sir W.\r\nThomson enables the magnetism of the ship to be completely corrected\r\ninstead of only approximately. This is attained by the use of several\r\nsmall needles instead of one or two large ones. The requisite\r\nsteadiness of the compass card is obtained by means of an aluminium\r\nrim suspended round the edge of the card. The extreme lightness of\r\nthe card reduces greatly the wear of the needle point supporting the\r\ncompass. Along with the compass the inventor supplies an azimuth\r\nmirror which greatly facilitates observations either on a point of\r\nland or on a star, the whole invention proving from experience an\r\nalmost indispensable item of outfit for well-appointed vessels.\r\n\r\nThe care and ingenuity expended on the question of ship safety must\r\nnot, however, be measured simply by the amount of attention and skill\r\nexercised in constructing and outfitting vessels of the common type.\r\nThe question has very naturally occasioned many distinct novelties\r\nin ship design. Some of these have been directly designed to secure\r\nsafety, but the greater number have aimed at combining with safety\r\nthe other qualities of speed and comfort; as in the instances given\r\nin the previous chapter. The success attained in practice, it need\r\nscarcely be said, has hitherto been but partial.\r\n\r\nThe problem of rendering ships absolutely unsinkable has, from very\r\nearly times, received attention from many concerned in shipbuilding\r\nand navigation. Propositions and trials have been made from time to\r\ntime, without as yet any very marked success attending any of them.\r\nVarious plans have been submitted for safety-ships, the general\r\nprinciple of which consists in forming the ship into two or more\r\ndistinct and entire portions, and in the event of one sustaining\r\ndamage by collision or otherwise, those remaining to be disconnected\r\nand sent adrift—presumably with all passengers on board.\r\n\r\nOther life-saving devices, while interfering somewhat with the\r\noriginal structure, have simply been intended to use or modify\r\nexisting features or material on board ship. Two of these which have\r\nreceived attention from the Scientific Societies may be shortly\r\ndescribed as examples of the class of devices referred to. One was\r\nthe proposition of Mr Jolly, M.A., of the Royal Navy, laid before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects in 1874; the other being that\r\nof Mr Gadd, submitted to the Manchester Mechanical Society in 1879.\r\nMr Jolly’s proposal was to construct what he felicitously termed\r\nthe “ark saloon,” an erection on the upper deck, and resembling\r\nvery closely an ordinary deck-house, but instead of being built\r\npermanently on the vessel, it was to be an independent structure\r\ncapable of being readily disconnected, and “while answering all the\r\npurposes of accommodation found in ordinary deck-houses, to have\r\nwithin it hidden resources capable of converting it when afloat\r\ninto a perfectly navigable vessel.” Mr Gadd’s proposal was to form\r\nthe upper portion of the bulwarks of ships of loose sections 12-ft.\r\nlong, composed chiefly of hollow, thin metallic tubes. These sections\r\nwhen immersed in the water would form so many pontoons, and would be\r\nprovided with cords and loops along their sides, and in the event\r\nof the ship going down would be lifted out of their place by the\r\naction of the water. Objections on economical grounds to Mr Jolly’s\r\nscheme, fully pointed out by members of the Institute, apply almost\r\nequally to the proposal of Mr Gadd. The expense involved in their\r\napplication would far outbalance in the eyes of the shipowner the\r\npossible service they could render. No provision was made by Mr Jolly\r\nfor launching his ark saloon, thereby limiting its use to cases of\r\nfoundering; and even in event of this, the “ark” was only to be so\r\nin name until the good ship should “go under,” and leave the saloon\r\nserenely floating—presumably with all souls inside. The difficulty in\r\nMr Gadd’s proposal, of at once making the bulwarks easily floatable\r\nand structurally efficient for the resistance of heavy seas,\r\nseriously detracted from its feasibility.\r\n\r\nIt would be a somewhat heavy task to make adequate note of all\r\nthe varied proposals and patented inventions for the preservation\r\nof life at sea. Some of these, as in the foregoing instances, are\r\nproposals affecting structural features; but others, and by far the\r\nmost numerous, are simply adjuncts to the vessel. Ingenuity has\r\nbeen specially directed of late towards bringing into efficient\r\nrequisition, in event of impending shipwreck, the commonest items of\r\na ship’s outfit. This has been abundantly evidenced in the several\r\nnaval exhibitions held within the past three years in various parts\r\nof the country. Firms whose work lies in cork and Indiarubber\r\nmanufactures have there exhibited in great profusion various forms\r\nof life-belts, life-buoys, life-saving mattresses and pillows, and\r\nlife-saving dresses. Others, availing themselves of larger items,\r\nhave shown life-saving adaptations of deck-seats, deck-houses, and\r\nbulwarks made into the form of life-rafts. Not a few of these devices\r\nhave received adoption in our passenger-carrying steamships, and\r\ntheir more general use—especially if accompanied by proper knowledge\r\nof how they may best be taken advantage of—would materially help to\r\nrob shipwreck of some of its terrors at least, if not of its dire\r\nfatalities. It has been urged in this connection—and the plea is\r\neminently reasonable—that Parliament should invest the Board of Trade\r\nwith proper powers—if that Body is not already vested with all that\r\nis requisite—to take the matter of life-saving appliances thoroughly\r\nand practically in hand, and by means of experiments in all kinds of\r\nweather to determine which are the best means of saving life under\r\ndifferent conditions. Having done this, also to draw up rules for\r\nthe proper stowage and use of such appliances on board ship, and to\r\nsee that such rules are strictly observed, and that no vessel be\r\npermitted to go to sea which is not so equipped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe development in the size of steamships not only affects the\r\nquality of safety, but also in various ways the element of comfort at\r\nsea. The greater length, for instance, is calculated to neutralise\r\nthe longitudinal oscillation, the effects of which are so often fatal\r\nto the comfort of passengers. Again, the great length affords an\r\nadvantage in the way of allowing better state-room accommodation; all\r\nthe rooms, or a larger proportion of them, being next the vessel’s\r\nside, and consequently more airy and better lighted. It is not,\r\nhowever, in the increased length so much as in the development of all\r\nthree dimensions, and especially in the increased ratio of breadth\r\nto length, that modern types of steamships are enhanced in the\r\nqualities of safety and comfort. Mistaken or imperfect notions as to\r\nthe ratio most desirable for speed, have kept in perpetuity types of\r\nsteamers which the fuller light of modern scientific investigation\r\nhas shown to be undesirable. Great beam is now believed to be not\r\nincompatible with great speed, and even apart from questions of speed\r\nthe advantages accruing from breadth are better appreciated.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this movement, one of the more recent of\r\nthe many transatlantic mail steamships may be instanced. In the\r\n_Aurania_, of the Cunard Company, the proportions—although perhaps\r\nonly in the line along which modern professional ideas tend—are\r\ncertainly in advance of the general practice with regard to vessels\r\nof her great size. The dimensions of the _Servia_, the _Alaska_,\r\nand the _City of Rome_—three vessels comparable with the _Aurania_\r\nas constituting the largest merchant vessels afloat—all give a\r\nproportion of 10 beams to the length. The _Aurania’s_ dimensions—470\r\nfeet by 57 feet by 39 feet—show her to have only about 8¼ beams to\r\nlength. The success of the older type of vessel having proportions\r\nsomewhat similar to this “modern instance” has in no material\r\nsense been eclipsed by the narrow types which subsequently for\r\nso long prevailed. Availing themselves of that freedom which\r\nindependence of the registration societies yield—their vessels not\r\nbeing “classed”—the Cunard Coy determined to adopt the old-time\r\nproportions. The step has been justified, in so far as affected by\r\nthe matter of speed, the powerful vessel, at her trials on the Clyde,\r\nhaving attained a mean speed of 17¾ knots, or 20½ statute miles, per\r\nhour. The stable qualities due to the great breadth of the _Aurania_\r\nhas in actual service further confirmed the wisdom of the change. The\r\nmagnificent vessels presently building on the Clyde for the Cunard\r\nCoy., though between 20 and 30 feet longer, are the same breadth as\r\nthe _Aurania_, _i.e._, 57 feet. This is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat the breadth of beam fixed for the _Aurania_ was the largest\r\namount permissible, having regard to the breadth of entrance of the\r\nlargest dock in New York. This _en passant_ is worthy of notice as\r\ngiving colourable justification to the complaints sometimes made that\r\ncivil engineers are urged to progress in dock accommodation only by\r\nshipbuilders treading on their heels.\r\n\r\nCoincident with the changes made in the dimensions and structure\r\nof vessels, there are numerous features of enhanced comfort for\r\npassengers and crew which are deserving of notice. Notably is\r\nthis manifest in the arrangement of saloons and state-rooms—their\r\nappointment, lighting, and ventilation. The character of steamships\r\nfor the great ocean highways in this respect is above and beyond\r\nanything which Board of Trade enactments seek to secure. The amount\r\nof spirited competition itself on those services, acts as an\r\nefficient promoter of excellence in design and equipment.\r\n\r\nIt is now the prevailing fashion to appropriate that part of a\r\nsteamer just before the engine and boiler hatchways for the principal\r\nsaloon and first-class berthing, and it has so many advantages over\r\nthe old plan of locating these apartments in the poop or after\r\nextremity of the vessel that its adoption in large steamers of the\r\npassenger-carrying trade has become all but general. Some of these\r\nadvantages may be briefly enumerated. They are:—ampler and airier\r\nsaloon space: the plumbness of the vessel’s sides permitting a\r\nsaloon completely athwartship, which is scarcely practicable in\r\nthe conventional situation aft, because of the curvature of sides;\r\nincreased facilities for ventilation; purer air; freedom from the\r\nnoise and vibration caused by propeller; comparative immunity from\r\nthe effects of “pitching” or longitudinal oscillation.\r\n\r\nNothing, perhaps, in connection with improved saloon accommodation\r\nstrikes one so much as the increased height between decks now\r\nprevalent. While from six-and-a-half to seven-and-a-half feet\r\nwas considered sufficient some years ago, it is now the practice\r\nin first-class steamers to make the height as much as from\r\neight-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half feet. The feeling of spaciousness\r\nthis change contributes to the saloons, as well as the scope it\r\nyields for architectural treatment of the walls, are not the least\r\ngratifying results of the improvement. How much the latter result\r\nhas been taken advantage of in our modern passenger steamships need\r\nscarcely be told, as their architectural and decorative character is\r\noften and eloquently enlarged upon by delighted voyagers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION OF GRAND SALOON IN _S.S. America_, SHOWING\r\nDOME-ROOF.]\r\n\r\nA noteworthy feature in improved saloon accommodation is the\r\nprovision of music rooms or social halls, which are usually situated\r\nabove the dining saloons, and connected or made one therewith by\r\nmeans of light and ventilation wells placed in the centre. The\r\nsize and ornamentation of these, and the light and air they are\r\nthe means of admitting, contribute in a very marked degree to the\r\nspaciousness, beauty, and comfort of the main saloon. By recent\r\nspecial modifications in the deck structure, several builders on the\r\nClyde—notably Messrs J. & G. Thomson—are rendering this feature of\r\ngreater value than ever. In the National Line Steamship _America_,\r\njust finished by the firm named and to which attention has already\r\nbeen directed, the Grand Saloon is a splendid apartment, extending\r\nfrom side to side of the vessel, and measures over eighty feet in\r\nlength. Its size and height are augmented in a remarkable degree by\r\nthe fitting of a dome-roof extending in height through two tiers\r\nof decks, and embracing about half the length of saloon. This\r\nfeature—some conception of which may be gathered from the sketches\r\nshown by Figs. 9 and 10, is altogether free of athwartship beams,\r\nand practically gives to the saloon a clear height of 18 feet. The\r\ncrown of the dome is formed of beautifully-executed stained glass,\r\nfinished round its base in a richly coloured frieze formed of panels\r\ncontaining well-executed oil paintings. The whole feature, for\r\nstructure, ampleness, and ornamentation, is a noteworthy advance in\r\nthe way of rendering the saloons of steamships more comfortable—not\r\nto say palatial—and reflects the utmost credit on the building firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTION OF GRAND SALOON IN _S.S. America_, SHOWING DOME-ROOF.]\r\n\r\nIn several vessels built within recent years on the Clyde there has\r\nbeen adopted—in addition to the athwartship middle length saloon, a\r\ncurious and complete reversal of the traditional arrangement with\r\nrespect to accommodation for the crew. The plan, one would think,\r\nmust shock the orthodox sentiment of our seamen, whatever they may\r\nthink of its utility. A few strokes of the draughtsman’s pencil, and\r\n_per saltum_ “Jack” and his “castle” are transported to the poop, and\r\nthe precincts so long sacred to his use are prostituted to the lounge\r\nand the tobacco pipe of the pampered “land-lubber”—_i.e._, they form\r\na luxuriant smoking saloon for passengers.\r\n\r\nOf the multifarious ways in which modern invention and skill are laid\r\nunder contribution to the end that voyagers shall have the maximum\r\nof safety and comfort on board ship, the system of electric lighting\r\nnow so extensively adopted is not the least noteworthy. It is only\r\nabout three years ago since the application of the incandescent form\r\nof electric lamp on board ship was first tried. The success of the\r\nsystem and its rapid extension during the subsequent period has been\r\nremarkable, and is a matter upon which electricians, shipowners, and\r\nsea voyagers are alike to be congratulated. In every well-appointed\r\npassenger ship for ocean service, the electric light has already\r\nsupplanted the former method of lighting the saloons, state-rooms,\r\nand machinery spaces, by means of oil lamps, which has so often\r\nproved a fruitful source of annoyance to passengers and crew, if not,\r\nindeed, of positive danger to the vessel herself.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the change are such as constitute the electric\r\nlight an invaluable acquisition on board every modern passenger\r\nsteamship. The light gives off very little heat, there is no smell,\r\nno products of combustion to produce headaches and sickness. No\r\nmatches are required, and the danger from fire is absolutely reduced\r\nto a minimum. The light requires little or no attention on the part\r\nof stewards, for it is only requisite that a man be sent round once\r\na day to see whether any of the lamps require renewal, and the\r\nrenewal of a lamp is performed as simply as trimming the wick of an\r\noil lamp or placing a fresh candle into a candlestick. The danger,\r\nannoyance and time, formerly spent in storing up and dealing out\r\nlarge quantities of paraffin or other oils, are completely obviated.\r\nThe lamps are as easily subject to the control of the passenger as\r\nordinary gas jets. Instead of the flickering and somewhat clumsy oil\r\nlamps, the electric system presents, encased in neat, tiny, glass\r\nglobes, a steady, mellow white light, the adaptability of which to\r\nany conceivable position or design is one of its most beautiful\r\nproperties. The artistic grouping of the electric incandescent lamps,\r\nand their combination with the architectural features of saloons,\r\nare matters to which the forms adopted for the best known lamps—the\r\nEdison & Swan types—specially lend themselves. A single Edison lamp\r\nis shown by Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nThe work in electric lighting on board ship for the year 1883 shows\r\nhow firmly the electric system has become established as the only\r\nsystem for first-class passenger vessels. The report of the Edison\r\n& Swan United Companies embraces the work on thirty-one vessels,\r\nincluding three Indian troopships (and four more on order), four\r\nvessels for the Clan Line, one for the Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany, one for the Union Steamship Company, three for the Cunard\r\nCompany, three for the British India Steam Navigation Company, three\r\nfor the New Zealand Shipping Company, and so on. The list of Messrs\r\nSiemens Brothers amounts to twenty high-class vessels, including the\r\n_Arizona_, the _Servia_, the _Aurania_, the _City of Rome_, the _City\r\nof Chicago_, the _Austral_, the _Germanic_, and the _Massilia_. These\r\ntwo firms thus give fifty-one vessels, and adding those entrusted to\r\noutsiders—four in all—affords a total of fifty-five, representing an\r\naggregate of not less than 11,000 incandescent lamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.\r\n\r\nEDISON LAMP.]\r\n\r\nThe application of the electric light on board ship to the purposes\r\nof signalling, as a substitute for the ordinary system of oil\r\nlanterns, has been fully shown in theory and already partially\r\neffected in practice, but its development in this direction is\r\nnecessarily retarded by considerations which do not affect its\r\nuse in the interior of vessels. Vessels traversing the ocean in\r\ndarkness are necessarily dependent one on the other for the means\r\nof knowing their proximity, and as the electric light much exceeds\r\nin power and brilliancy that of oil lanterns, it would have the\r\neffect of eclipsing the latter even within a large radius. The\r\nadoption of the electric light for this very important purpose\r\nwould, therefore, have to be pretty much a simultaneous and general\r\nmovement throughout the ships of the various companies, if not of\r\nthe various nations. Apart from such considerations, however, other\r\nobjections have been instanced to the appropriation of the electric\r\nlight for this purpose. Difficulty, it is said, has been experienced\r\nin distinguishing the colours pertaining to the port and starboard\r\nside-lights, and fears are entertained regarding the liability of\r\nthe light, or the machinery employed in generating the current, to\r\nsuddenly fail in its action. Few of the objections named, of course,\r\namount to very serious obstacles, and as the system is yet so much\r\nin its infancy, it may well happen that a few years will witness all\r\nthat is here foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nShort of this universal and complete appropriation of the electric\r\nlight for signalling, however, it has been introduced with gratifying\r\nresults in mercantile steamers for various important purposes—_e.g._,\r\nfor lighting up the decks and surrounding wharfage during the work\r\nof loading or disembarking cargo; for projecting a flood of light\r\nahead of a vessel’s course where navigation is difficult, and when\r\ndanger in the shape of rocks or icebergs is imminent. The employment\r\nof the light in the way last named has been specially extended in the\r\ncase of vessels intended for naval warfare. By its powerful aid the\r\nposition and tactics of the enemy, the configuration of forts about\r\nto be assailed, or the nature of the land where it is proposed to\r\ndisembark, can all be revealed, with a minuteness almost as perfect\r\nas that due to the light of day.\r\n\r\nAnother feature on board ship affecting most intimately the\r\nwell-being and comfort of passengers—too often, indeed, the safety of\r\nthe ship itself—is that of ventilation. The thorough and efficient\r\nventilation of ships is a feature which only during very recent times\r\nhas received from shipowners and shipbuilders the amount of attention\r\nit deserves. The inadequacy of the methods of ventilation existing\r\nin emigrant ships, and as applied to holds for the ventilation of\r\ncargoes, engaged public attention very considerably a few years ago.\r\nThe explosion on board the _Doterel_, with other like casualties,\r\nresulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the\r\nventilation of ships. The prominence thus given to the subject and\r\nthe experience then gained, have been fruitful of increased regard\r\nfor efficiency in ship ventilation. In the absence for such a long\r\ntime, however, of any system capable of universal application and\r\nhaving at once the merits of efficiency and cheapness, shipowners\r\nhave adhered to old-fashioned, unscientific, and ineffective methods\r\nlong after the invention of improved systems, one or other of which\r\nwould have well repaid adoption.\r\n\r\nIn ways and to an extent which may perhaps have been made evident\r\nin the previous pages, the introduction of the electric light is\r\nof itself greatly advantageous in this connection. One striking\r\npeculiarity of the change perhaps requires more explicit statement.\r\nThis is the curious fact—patent enough to all who know anything of\r\nthe properties of the incandescent light—that what is the very life\r\nof oil or other lights, is to it, certain death. The element thus\r\nvitally concerned is, of course, oxygen; and it need not be more than\r\nhinted that in existing so entirely without this element—at all times\r\na great desideratum in passenger ships—the electric light is a vast\r\nbenefactor to all who “go down to the sea in ships.”\r\n\r\nMany highly-improved methods of ventilation are now open to the\r\nshipowner; the number of patented systems in use or awaiting\r\nadoption being adequate testimony to the widespread attention\r\nbestowed upon the subject. These divide themselves into two general\r\nclasses:—firstly, systems which aim at providing an efficient\r\nself-acting series of ventilating pipes in which the natural current\r\nor that induced by the vessel’s own speed through the atmosphere, is\r\nthe only force utilised; and secondly, those in which machines driven\r\nby steam power are employed to produce fresh currents or extract\r\nvitiated atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nVarious forms of ventilators, belonging to the first-named class,\r\nhave been introduced into many ocean-going passenger vessels within\r\nrecent years, the result being a considerable improvement in the\r\nsanitary condition of the more confined portions of vessels. One of\r\nthe most approved of these, receiving specially extended adoption,\r\namounting as it does to a highly perfected system, may be noticed\r\na little in detail. This is the form of ventilator patented and\r\nintroduced by Messrs R. Boyle & Son, the well known ventilating\r\nengineers of London and Glasgow, consisting of upcast and downcast\r\nshafts fixed above deck, communicating with the interior of vessel by\r\na system of piping led to the various compartments. The upcast, or\r\n“air pump” ventilator, as the patentees term it, consists of a fixed\r\nhead having an ingenious arrangement of louvre webs, whereby the wind\r\nimpinging upon it from any direction, creates a current and exhausts\r\nthe air from the cylinder of which the head is part, the foul air\r\nfrom below immediately ascending to supply the place of the air\r\nextracted. A continuous and powerful upward current is thus induced,\r\nand the head is so devised as to effectually prevent down-draught\r\nor the inlet of water. The elevation and plan of this ventilator\r\nis shown by Figs. 12 and 13. In Fig. 13, 1 represents cylindrical\r\nchamber communicating with shaft below; 2, deep lip to prevent the\r\npossibility of water passing into cylinder and down the shaft; 3,\r\ncurved plates to deflect and compress the air over outlet openings or\r\nslits; 4, creates an induced current and exhausts the air from the\r\ncylinder; 5, radial plates to deflect air off centre of slits; 6,\r\ncurved baffle plate or guard, to concentrate the current, and prevent\r\nthe wind blowing through the slits opposite. The downcast ventilator,\r\nthough necessarily more simple, is arranged, by means of similar\r\nlouvered webs to prevent any water passing below, lodging it on the\r\nopen deck instead. By means of up and downcast ventilators of this\r\ntype, it is possible to have the ventilation going on between decks\r\nwithout interruption when there is a storm blowing and seas sweeping\r\nthe deck, whereas under ordinary conditions, and in similar weather,\r\neverything would be battened down and the ventilation _nil_. The\r\ninventors, of course, are able to point to other advantages possessed\r\nby these ventilators, but the above are the salient features,\r\nwhich have won for their system marked recognition and pretty wide\r\nadoption. As evidencing its efficiency, it may be stated that Messrs\r\nBoyle’s system was awarded the “Burt” prize of £50, offered for\r\ninternational competition by the Shipwrights’ Coy. of London in 1882\r\nfor the best system of ship ventilation.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the great importance of first providing means\r\nwhereby foul air may be extracted from compartments rather than first\r\nattempting to put fresh air in—at least by other than mechanical\r\nmeans—it has become the practice with several steamship companies\r\nto fit a series of pipes from the rooms throughout the ’tween decks\r\nall leading into a common main, carrying this main into the boiler\r\nfunnel, and thus utilising the powerful draught existing there when\r\nthe vessel is under way. The efficiency of this method is all that\r\ncould be wished, but its action is necessarily impaired when the\r\nvessel is in port and the boilers not in use. For steamships having\r\nlong runs its value is very considerable; but in steamers having\r\nshort passages and long port delays its merits are not so pronounced,\r\nand it is, of course, of no account when sailing ships are concerned.\r\n\r\nTwo systems of ventilation much alike in principle and equally\r\napplicable to the steamer and sailing ship may be shortly referred\r\nto. One is the Norton Ventilator, in which the dipping motion of\r\nvessels is utilised in effecting their own ventilation; the action\r\nin ocean-going vessels, of course, being continuous and automatic.\r\nTwo cylinders, closed at the upper ends, are placed on each side of\r\nthe stern post at such a distance as not to interfere in any way with\r\nthe action of the rudder, and sufficiently close under the stern to\r\nbe well out of harm’s way. As the vessel rises the water drops in\r\nthese cylinders, which are partly submerged, and in its fall causes a\r\nvacuum, to fill which the air is drawn from all parts of the ship.\r\nThe sinking motion of the vessel again fills the cylinders and forces\r\nthe foul air collected, through the discharge pipes. The ventilator\r\nadmits also of being actuated by steam or other power on board\r\nsteamships, the exhausting and forcing device in this case consisting\r\nof a water bell or air chamber to which a vertical reciprocating\r\nmotion is imparted by a beam or other attachment operated upon by the\r\nmechanical power adopted. The other method referred to is that now\r\nbeing pretty extensively introduced by Messrs Mosses and Mitchell, of\r\nLondon. It consists of two small cylinders, placed on either side of\r\na ship, in-board, and connected by a pipe. The cylinders are partly\r\nfilled with water, and, as the vessel rolls, the water rushes from\r\nthe elevated to the depressed side of the ship, from one cylinder\r\nto the other, and, by creating a vacuum, draws up the foul air from\r\nbetween decks, or out of the hold, by pipes leading below. The air\r\nwhich is pumped up by this self-acting process goes out through a\r\ndischarge pipe over the side, and such is the force of its exit that\r\nit serves to blow a foghorn when required. The cylinders can be\r\nplaced so as to be worked by the pitching as well as the rolling of\r\nthe vessel, and there is always a sufficient movement of the water to\r\nkeep these pumps in action.\r\n\r\nSystems of the other class—those involving the aid of mechanical\r\npower—are as much available as the automatic systems, but the greater\r\nexpense of fitting, maintaining, and working them are considerations,\r\napart from the question of their greater efficiency, which stand in\r\nthe way of their general adoption. In vessels chiefly intended for\r\npassenger or emigrant carrying, artificial ventilation by mechanical\r\nmeans has been provided, and the practice is greatly on the increase,\r\nbut systems in which natural agents are more largely brought into\r\nrequisition have advantages which appeal most effectually to ship\r\nowners in general.\r\n\r\nIn several modern steamships engaged in cargo and passenger service,\r\nhydraulic machinery designed to take the place of the usual deck\r\nsteam equipment has recently been introduced with great advantage.\r\nThis embraces machinery used for steering the vessel, loading and\r\ndischarging cargo, heaving anchors; for performing, indeed, all the\r\nwork on board excepting that of propulsion. From experience of the\r\nwell proved utility and durability of hydraulic power on shore, it\r\nseems quite a natural consequence that it should take its place on\r\nboard ship. Indeed, the system has so many advantages both from\r\nthe point of view of the passenger and of the steamship owner,\r\nthe wonder is that its introduction has been so long delayed. Its\r\nperfect noiselessness, as compared with the rattling, hissing, steam\r\nmachinery now in vogue, is an advantage which will appeal strongly\r\nto the sea voyager. The great speed of the system, as well as the\r\nabsence of jar and noise, the reduction in wear and tear, and the\r\nobviating of well-known disadvantages incidental to steam pipes, are\r\nmerits of the system which are bound to appeal to the steamship owner.\r\n\r\nIt has been well pointed out by Mr A. Betts Brown, of Edinburgh, the\r\npatentee and manufacturer of this class of machinery, in a paper read\r\nby him before a recent meeting of the Institution of Naval Architects\r\nthat—“With all the noise of steam engines at work on deck, running at\r\npiston speeds of as much as 1000 feet per minute, the cargo is lifted\r\nfrom the hold at a rate of only from one to two feet per second,\r\nwhich cannot be considered as keeping pace with the general progress\r\nmade in other departments of steamship economy. In short, vast sums\r\nare spent on fuel to gain half a knot extra speed on a passage,\r\nwhile hours may be wasted in port in consequence of the primitive\r\nnature of the present system of deck machinery for discharging\r\ncargo.” Previous to 1880, Mr Brown had supplied and fitted hydraulic\r\nmachinery on board the paddle-steamer _Cosmos_, built by Messrs A.\r\n& J. Inglis, of Glasgow, intended for South American river service,\r\nbut it was only in that year that he had an opportunity of fitting a\r\nlarge ocean-trading steamship with the system. This was the _Quetta_,\r\nbuilt by Messrs Denny, Dumbarton, to whom, with the managers of\r\nthe British India Association Steam Navigation Company, who own\r\nthe vessel, Mr Brown ascribes credit for the opportunity afforded\r\nhim of fitting his firm’s system on a complete scale. The _Quetta_\r\nis 380-ft. in length, 40-ft. breadth, depth of hold 29-ft., and\r\n3,302 tons gross, and is fitted with a complete system of hydraulic\r\nmachinery performing the following functions:—Steering, heaving the\r\nanchor, warping by capstans fore and aft, taking in and discharging\r\ncargo, lowering the derricks to clear cargo over side, hoisting\r\nashes, reversing main engines, and shutting tunnel water-tight\r\ndoor in engine-room. For detailed descriptions of these various\r\nappliances, the reader is referred to the before-mentioned paper.\r\nThe most for which space is here available is a very general outline\r\nof the principle on which they are supplied with motive power. The\r\nprime mover consists of a pair of compound surface-condensing pumping\r\nengines of 100 indicated horse-power, situated in the engine-room\r\nof the vessel. These engines pump water (or in winter non-freezing\r\nfluid) from a tank into a steam accumulator. The pumping engines are\r\nstarted and stopped by the falling or rising of the steam piston in\r\nthe accumulator; and since the piston falls when the hydraulic power\r\nis being utilised, and rises to its former level when the power is\r\nnot in use, it follows that the apparatus is perfectly automatic.\r\nOnce started, it does not require the supervision of an engineer,\r\nand it maintains a steady pressure of 800-lbs. per square inch in\r\nthe hydraulic mains or pressure pipes. These are carried up from\r\nthe engine-room, and extend fore and aft the ship. Alongside the\r\npressure main a similar return main is laid, which discharges into\r\nthe tank. From the pressure mains branches are connected to the\r\nvarious hydraulic machines. After having done its work, the water\r\nis discharged into the return mains, being thus used over and over\r\nagain. The experience obtained in the working of the _Quetta_ shows\r\nthat a donkey boiler of the usual size, just sufficient for steam\r\nwinches, enables the cargo to be discharged in half the time: in\r\nother words, does double the work on a given coal consumpt with\r\ncompound surface-condensing pumping engine, and the hydraulic system.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of hydraulic machinery have been thus summarised:—A\r\npair of engines in one place do, with no noise and half the\r\nconsumption of fuel, the work usually performed by perhaps a dozen\r\ndonkey engines, while about £30 or £40 a voyage is saved in wear and\r\ntear. The increase of speed obtained in loading and discharging cargo\r\npractically ensures a quicker voyage. The rapidly working machinery\r\nnecessitates double gangs of men in the hold; but though the hands\r\nare more numerous they are paid for a shorter time, and the cost of\r\nlabour per ton of cargo is thus less than usual. The prime outlay\r\nis considerably greater than under the ordinary system, but it is\r\ncalculated that in at least three years the extra expense will have\r\nbeen saved.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable increase in cost (more than double\r\nthat of steam equipment) of the hydraulic system, the British India\r\nAssociation have seen their way to fit the succeeding steamers\r\nthey have built, similarly to the _Quetta_, namely, the _Bulimba_,\r\n_Waroonga_, and _Manora_, the two intervening ships having their\r\nemigrant quarters ventilated by fans driven by hydraulic engines, as\r\nwell as the usual deck equipment. In addition to the above, there\r\nhave already been nine other steamers fitted successfully by Mr\r\nBrown’s firm with hydraulic machinery—including the Union Steamship\r\nCoy.’s _Tartar_, of 4340 tons—and there is every prospect now of its\r\ntaking the place of the noisy steam machinery in at least our most\r\nimportant passenger lines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe regard which is had to comfort and luxury in modern passenger\r\nsteamers has manifested itself—like the attention devoted to\r\nswiftness and safety—in various propositions and designs of a more\r\nor less novel kind. These, indeed, have very often consisted of\r\ndesigns embracing the whole of the qualities named; comfort and\r\nluxury being coincident with the more important properties of speed\r\nand safety already noticed; but not a few propositions and actual\r\nundertakings have consisted of vessels in which comfort has largely\r\nbeen the dominant and regulating condition of design. This subject\r\nreceives happier illustration from the history of steam service\r\nbetween England and France, than perhaps from any other service\r\nthat could be instanced. The thought and speech expended on “an\r\nefficient Channel service” at the meetings of the various societies\r\nconcerned with shipbuilding and marine engineering, and the space\r\ndevoted to the subject in the technical journals, has been no more\r\nthan commensurate with the number and variety of projects for its\r\naccomplishment, submitted from time to time. Many of the schemes\r\nhave not been quite of a marine character, and these, of course,\r\nlie beyond the province of the present review; but so far as ships\r\nare concerned, it is interesting to note to what extent comfort has\r\nbeen the dominant and regulating condition in the designs. In the\r\n_Castalia_ and the _Calais-Douvres_, employed in Channel service,\r\nfeatures of considerable novelty—notably the double hulls—were\r\nadopted, and it was to the desire for increased comfort as much as\r\nspeed that their introduction was owing.\r\n\r\nIn the steamer _Bessemer_, however, built at Hull in 1875, this\r\nsubject finds happiest illustration. This steamer, which involved\r\nsome very interesting and novel problems in shipbuilding—in which\r\nthe matters of propulsion and steering were largely concerned—was\r\ndesigned for the special purpose of practically testing an invention\r\nof Mr Henry Bessemer’s, having as its object the alleviation of the\r\nevils of sea-sickness. Mr (now Sir Henry) Bessemer’s invention, as\r\napplied in this case, consisted of a saloon supported on longitudinal\r\npivots, which was to be made unsusceptible to transverse oscillation\r\nby the application to it of machinery wrought by hydraulic power. It\r\nwas the intention of the eminent inventor to have applied this system\r\nto the correction of longitudinal as well as transverse oscillation,\r\nbut on considering that the steamer was to be of large dimensions\r\nand performing a service in comparatively small waves it was thought\r\ndesirable to limit its application to transverse motion, at the same\r\ntime having regard to the longitudinal motion by reducing the height\r\nof the vessel for a distance of 50-ft. at each end, thereby inducing\r\ndepression at the extremities, through the vessel’s not rising to,\r\nbut being overswept by, the waves.\r\n\r\nAlthough an influential company was formed to work the _Bessemer_\r\nand other vessels embodying her novel features, which it was thought\r\nmight follow, she was virtually abandoned after one or two trials\r\nacross the Channel. Her failure was assumed without exhaustive and\r\nconclusive trials being made of the many novelties embodied in\r\nher construction, some of which were obviously of an experimental\r\ncharacter. This is the more to be regretted because of the beneficent\r\nissues involved in the project, and also in some degree because of\r\nthe extent to which the faith of some intrepid and experienced men\r\nwas pledged to its success. Nevertheless, it was always a matter of\r\ngrave doubt, even when the fullest measure of mechanical success was\r\nallowed for, whether the idea of the pivoted saloon was calculated to\r\nsecure that immunity from the effects of ship motion in a seaway, for\r\nwhich the celebrated patentee felt induced to hope.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained by many who profess to have given the subject\r\nattention, that sea-sickness in its most virulent forms, and in the\r\nmajority of instances, is less attributable to the transverse and\r\nlongitudinal oscillations—known respectively, as the “rolling” and\r\n“pitching” motions—than to the vertical movement termed “dipping,”\r\nwhich in its descent from the summit of one wave until upborne by the\r\nwave next following, the vessel undergoes. Now, this is a condition\r\nfor which, in the Bessemer project, there was no provision, nor\r\nindeed well can be under any circumstances, save in the simple but\r\ncostly expedient of adding to the dimensions or bulk of vessels,\r\nirrespective of form. The Czar of Russia’s yacht _Livadia_, built\r\nsome years ago, exemplified in her extraordinary dimensions and great\r\nbulk the truth of such reasoning. The actual rolling and pitching of\r\nthis remarkable vessel, as observed in the height of a gale in the\r\nBay of Biscay, and in the midst of very heavy seas, was exceeding\r\nsmall. This never exceeded four degrees for the single roll, or seven\r\ndegrees for the double roll, nor beyond five degrees for the forward\r\npitch, or nine degrees for the double pitch, so to speak. This\r\nhorizontal steadiness appeared to experts, who were on board at the\r\ntime, most remarkable, and Sir E. J. Reed, in a communication to the\r\n_Times_, commented amongst other things on the agreeableness of the\r\ncontrast the voyage on the _Livadia_ afforded, with his experience of\r\nvoyaging at sea in ordinary ships.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it must be acknowledged that attempts hitherto made to\r\nobviate the evils of sea-sickness by novelty in design fall very\r\nfar short of attaining the beneficent results sought after. The\r\n_Bessemer_, the _Livadia_, the _Calais-Douvres_, and other _unique_\r\ncraft primarily conceived with regard to this end, are now, it\r\nwould seem, exemplifying in their latter fate the futility of the\r\nendeavour. Such attempts, however ill-advised they may possibly\r\nappear in the light of the knowledge their very failure or their\r\npartial successes yield, have still their creditable and praiseworthy\r\naspects. The spirit which has prompted some of them is not wholly\r\none of money-making, and their histories enrich the general fund of\r\nexperience far more than libraries of untried theories. Shipowners\r\nare too ready to shut their minds against everything which seeks\r\nthe _acme_ of comfort and safety by other means than those which\r\nguarantee _economical_ success, or those which consist in increasing\r\nthe size and power, and enhancing the accommodation of conventional\r\ntypes of vessels. These novelties and innovations, on the other hand,\r\nrepresent more of the intrepidity essential to genuine advancement\r\nthan is forthcoming in a thousand merchant ships of the conventional\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nHappily the need for such enterprise as is involved in at once\r\ndeparting from tried types, has within recent years been largely, if\r\nnot altogether, obviated, through improved procedure in the work of\r\ndesign. The more thoroughly analytic process of investigation and\r\nexperiment now in vogue, greatly curtails the number of novelties\r\nintroduced, or which reach the constructive stage. Many present-day\r\nprojects never get beyond the “paper stage,” which in times not so\r\nfar distant would have spelled out “failure” to the very last letter.\r\nSince the system of model experiment has begun to be practised in\r\na reliable manner, and since theoretical prediction generally has\r\nbecome better appreciated, over-sanguine inventors have been spared\r\nthe penalties of failure in actual practice, and ingenuity has been\r\nreclaimed or warned away from channels that would inevitably have\r\nproved chimerical.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Papers bearing on the safety and comfort of modern\r\nsteamships, to which readers desiring fuller acquaintance with the\r\n_technique_ and details of the subjects are referred:—\r\n\r\n  ON THE NECESSITY OF FITTING PASSENGER SHIPS WITH SUFFICIENT\r\n  WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS, by Mr Lawrance Hill: Trans.

This is already yielding benefits and\r\nensuring successes which only a few years ago would have remained\r\nungathered and unachieved, or at best would only have been attained\r\nafter wasteful expenditure of money, time, and skill, if not the\r\nsacrifice of human life. Not so long ago endeavours were seldom made\r\nto extract lessons of general value from particular occurrences,\r\nthere being a disposition prevalent to accept facts without\r\naccounting for them—“to rejoice in a success and regard a failure as\r\nirreparable”—the outcome, it may at once be said, of indifference,\r\nfalse ideas of economy, and of a limited conception of the part\r\nscientific methods should play in successful shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nParticular occurrences within recent years have without doubt played\r\na large part in bringing about this more general and intelligent\r\nappreciation of such matters. Some maintain, indeed, that it is\r\nonly under pressure of circumstances that anything like proper\r\nregard for fundamental principles has obtained hold among mercantile\r\nshipbuilders. This remissness, even admitting it to be true, is the\r\nmore natural and excusable in private commercial concerns, when it\r\nis considered that the bulk of progress made, even in Admiralty\r\nquarters—where ships take several years each to build, and there\r\nis more time for scientific investigation and experiment than is\r\npossible in mercantile work—is more attributable to the awakenings\r\nwhich have followed upon great disasters than to the natural\r\nimprovement of ordinary practice. The terrible loss of the _Captain_\r\nin September, 1870, for example, by which 500 lives were sacrificed,\r\nled to a fuller recognition of the necessity for exact experiment\r\nand calculation to determine thoroughly the conditions of stability\r\nfor war vessels; and many war-ships then under construction at the\r\ndockyards—particularly those of the low freeboard type—were altered\r\nin consequence, for the purpose of adding to their safety. The\r\ncapsizing of the _Eurydice_ off the Isle of Wight in March, 1878;\r\nthe mysterious and mournful loss of her sister ship the _Atalanta_\r\nin 1880; the explosion on board the _Thunderer_ in 1876, by which 45\r\nlives were lost, and the still more calamitous case of the _Doterel_\r\nin April, 1881, by which the ship and 148 lives were destroyed,\r\nare all instances of calamity, the causes of which have formed the\r\nsubject of official inquiry, all in their turn teaching important\r\nlessons and yielding subsequent benefits not easily calculable.\r\n\r\nRecent occurrences of a very calamitous nature in connection with\r\nmerchant ships—some of which will be more explicitly referred to\r\nfurther on—have been attended with similarly mournful, but, it may\r\nbe added, with similarly beneficial results. These disasters and\r\nthe resulting inquiries have shown pretty conclusively that the\r\nknowledge of a vessel’s stability and other vital qualities possessed\r\nby ship’s officers is often meagre and erroneous; and that far too\r\nlittle attention is usually paid to a vessel’s technical qualities\r\nby shipowners or their advisers. They have also tended to prove that\r\nexact knowledge of the principles of ship design, and observance of\r\nscientific method in their construction, are not yet sufficiently\r\nprevalent or thorough in mercantile shipyards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProgress in the pure science of naval architecture, as distinguished\r\nfrom the practical application of scientific rules and principles\r\nto shipbuilding, is a great and complex subject, and one which it\r\nwould be impossible to do full justice to here. Before attempting\r\nto treat upon these matters as concerned with the period covered by\r\nthis review, it may be instructive to trace briefly the progress\r\nmade in the past, and take note of the agencies through which such\r\nprogress has been effected. In this undertaking, concerned as it\r\nis with matters relating to a period prior to that with which the\r\npresent work chiefly deals, the author has availed himself to some\r\nextent of already published works traversing the same ground. As\r\nhaving afforded the needful assistance in this connection, and as\r\nbeing a source to which readers may turn for fuller information,\r\nreference may here be made to an article in the _Westminster Review_\r\nof January, 1881, on “The Progress of Shipbuilding in England.” This\r\narticle, though unsigned, is from the pen of Mr W. H. White, late\r\nChief Constructor of the Navy, and author of the well known “Manual\r\nof Naval Architecture.” It furnishes an appreciative and concise\r\naccount of the literature and the educational agencies connected\r\nwith the theory of naval architecture, and sketches the influence of\r\nscience on practice, and _vice versa_ in the profession since the\r\nbeginning of the present century.\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, the period during which scientific\r\nknowledge and methods have had any considerable place in merchant\r\nshipbuilding, does not extend back over very many years. In\r\nconnection with the Royal Navy, however, the study of scientific\r\nnaval architecture has been fostered and promoted under Government\r\nauspices almost from the commencement of the present century; not,\r\nhowever—it must be added—without alternating periods of regard and\r\nneglect, nor irrespective of pressure from extraneous sources.\r\n\r\nAlthough progress in this matter has not been solely due to\r\nGovernment agencies, it may be maintained that a large part of the\r\npositive and accurate scientific knowledge which now exists has\r\ngrown out of the exigencies of the naval service, and has come from\r\nsources more or less supported by or connected with Government\r\ninstitutions. It will of course be understood that the science of\r\nnaval architecture is a field in which many besides shipbuilders,\r\nand indeed many besides professional naval architects, have laboured\r\nwith signal success. The fund of knowledge has been enriched, and\r\nthe practice of shipbuilding improved, by men whose association\r\nwith the shipyard has been of an indirect and amateur kind, and—it\r\nmust be added—whose valuable labours the shipyard has often but\r\nscantily recognised. Mathematicians—“mere theorists,” as they have\r\nbeen called—have made original investigations and scientific analyses\r\nwhich have upset many previously received practical notions, and\r\nestablished principles, the appreciation of which alone, has led to\r\nsubsequent progress in actual practice. The part taken by merchant\r\nshipbuilders has consisted in the experimental verification, and\r\nsometimes the practical correction of principles thus evolved, but\r\neven to this extent the service done has been largely incidental.\r\nThose considerations which form the economic basis of every\r\ncommercial concern have naturally circumscribed such service, and\r\nonly a few notable firms have been able to break through the common\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nThe systematic study of scientific naval architecture may be said\r\nonly to have begun in Britain in 1811, in which year, as the outcome\r\nof recommendations made by a Government Commission appointed to\r\ninquire into naval construction in 1806, the first School of Naval\r\nArchitecture was established at Portsmouth, under the direction of\r\nDr Inman, a distinguished member of the University of Cambridge. All\r\nthe great advances which had been made previously in the science\r\nof naval architecture were chiefly due to foreigners, and any one\r\nwishing to acquaint himself at first hand with all that was then\r\nmost advanced would have to consult the learned treatises of such\r\ndistinguished Frenchmen as Bouguer, Dupin, Euler, D’Alembert, and the\r\nAbbé Bossut, of the distinguished Spaniard Don Juan d’Ulloa, and of\r\nChapman, the celebrated constructor of the Swedish Navy. One or two\r\nEnglish writers, between 1750 and 1800, had published translations\r\nof some of these foreign treatises, but the only original work of\r\nany importance was by Atwood, who contributed a “Disquisition on\r\nthe Stability of Ships” to the proceedings of the Royal Society\r\n(1796-98). This contribution was both a criticism and an extension of\r\nflotation and stability investigations by Bouguer, and as an example\r\nof scientific method applied to exact calculations of the qualities\r\nof ships it is still well worthy of study. In 1791 a “Society for the\r\nImprovement of Naval Architecture” had been formed, the membership\r\nbeing both numerous and influential, and in 1806 the growing sense of\r\nneed for improved scientific methods culminated in the appointment of\r\nthe Commission above mentioned, and in the establishment five years\r\nlater of the first School of Naval Architecture. This institution\r\nexisted for over twenty years, over forty students were trained, and\r\nthe science of naval architecture was greatly promoted through its\r\nagency. Almost as a body the students of this school, with their\r\nable teacher, deserve the honour of being regarded as the founders\r\nof an English literature of naval architecture. Nevertheless, the\r\nrecognition of Dr Inman’s services, and his pupils’ capabilities as\r\ndesigners, by the naval authorities was of a cold and disappointing\r\nnature. Ultimately, however, many of them attained positions wherein\r\ntheir talents found worthy exercise.\r\n\r\nAfter the abolition of the School of Naval Architecture, under Dr\r\nInman, in 1832, no agency for higher education existed until 1848,\r\nwhen the urgent necessity for a steam re-construction of the Navy\r\nforced attention to the want of trained men, and resulted in the\r\nestablishment of a second school at Portsmouth. The principal of\r\nthis school was Dr Woolley, an eminent graduate of the University\r\nof Cambridge. From 1848 on to the present time, Dr Woolley has\r\nheld a prominent place amongst the promoters of naval science, and\r\nthe pupils produced by the institution under his directorship have\r\ngiven in various ways good practical evidence of his capability as a\r\nteacher. After five or six years of useful work, this second school\r\nwas done away with, and a third was established in London in 1864,\r\nafter pressure had been brought to bear upon the Government of the\r\nday by the Institution of Naval Architects—an association which was\r\nfounded in 1860, and which has since had so flourishing an existence.\r\n\r\nThe new school was placed for a time under the control of the\r\nScience and Art Department at South Kensington, Dr Woolley being\r\nInspector-General, and the late Mr C. W. Merrifield, F.R.S.,\r\nPrincipal. This school, unlike its predecessors, was not nominally a\r\nmere Admiralty establishment, but offered admission to private naval\r\narchitects and engineers, and did not exclude foreigners. It remained\r\nin operation at South Kensington until 1873, when the Admiralty\r\ndecided to establish the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and to\r\ntrain their students of naval architecture and marine engineering\r\nthere. Since 1873, therefore, what may be regarded as a continuation\r\nof the third school has been at work at Greenwich, the Admiralty\r\ngranting facilities for the entry of private and foreign students,\r\nmuch as was done at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nThe small extent to which this institution has been taken advantage\r\nof by private students, or by those whose aim is to equip themselves\r\nfor service in merchant shipbuilding, notwithstanding the inducements\r\nexisting in the shape of substantial scholarships, has often been\r\nsubject of comment. Various reasons have been adduced for this state\r\nof matters, but the true cause would seem to be largely concerned\r\nwith the character of the entrance examinations and with the course\r\nof study provided. The subject is well worthy of consideration, and\r\nfuller reference will be made to it further on when some educational\r\nagencies which have been recently established are under consideration.\r\n\r\nAt such important junctures in the history of shipbuilding as the\r\nintroduction of steam power for propulsion in place of sails, and\r\nthe employment of iron in place of wood for the hulls, precedent\r\nand experience lost much of their value under the new conditions.\r\nThe association of civil and mechanical engineers with shipbuilding\r\nat these crises was of immense advantage. Such men as Fairbairn\r\nand Brunel, who had previously gained high reputations in other\r\nbranches, were enabled by their scientific skill in designing bridges\r\nand other structures in wrought-iron, to achieve much, and to take\r\nthe lead in ship design and construction. “To men of this class,”\r\nsays Mr W. H. White, in the article already alluded to, “careful\r\npreliminary investigation and calculation naturally formed part\r\nof the work of designing ships; ‘rule of thumb’ was not likely to\r\nfind favour, even if it had been applicable, which it was not, under\r\nthe circumstances. At first, much was done on imperfect methods,\r\ncomparatively in the dark; failures were not rare; yet progress was\r\nmade, and gradually greater precision was attained, in the attempt\r\nto design steamers capable of proceeding at certain assigned speeds\r\nwhen laden to a given draught. In fact, the construction of steamers\r\nrendered imperative a careful study of the laws of fluid resistance,\r\nand of the cognate investigation of the mechanical theory of\r\npropulsion—both of which subjects lay practically outside the field\r\nof the designers of sailing ships. The speed of a sailing ship is\r\nobviously dependent upon the force and direction of the wind; her\r\ndesigner, therefore, chooses forms and proportions which will enable\r\na good spread of canvas to be carried, on a handy stable vessel.\r\nQuestions of resistance to the progress of the ship were therefore\r\nsubordinated to sail-carrying power and handiness in sailing ships;\r\nwhereas in steamers designed for a certain speed the question of\r\nresistance occupies a primary place, seeing that the engine power\r\nmust be proportioned to the resistance. Consequently, while keeping\r\nin view stability, handiness, and structural strength, the designer\r\nof a steamer has a more difficult task than the designer of a sailing\r\nship, and the difficulty can only be met if faced intelligently by\r\nscientific analysis. Hence it happened, as was previously remarked,\r\nthat a more general appreciation of the value of scientific methods\r\naccompanied the development of steam navigation and iron shipbuilding\r\nin the British mercantile marine.”\r\n\r\nAnother name that must be linked with those already mentioned in\r\nconnection with the change from wood to iron in shipbuilding, and\r\nwith the new conditions imposed by the transition from sail to steam,\r\nis that of the late Mr John Scott Russell, already referred to at the\r\nbeginning of this work. In the fields of inquiry so largely opened\r\nup at the period referred to, Mr Russell was a most distinguished\r\nworker. His advocacy and adoption in practice of special structural\r\nprinciples, as illustrated not only in the _Great Eastern_ but in\r\nother vessels, has influenced subsequent practice incalculably, and\r\nby his persevering investigations upon the resistance of vessels,\r\nand the “wave-line” theory he advanced, as well as by his inquiry\r\ninto the characteristics of wave motion, he laid designers of that\r\nperiod and subsequent investigators under great indebtedness. His\r\ncontributions to the literature of the profession—notably his _magnum\r\nopus_, entitled “Modern System of Naval Architecture”—and the large\r\nshare he subsequently took in the deliberations of the Institution of\r\nNaval Architects, and of other societies concerned with shipbuilding\r\nand engineering, enhance that indebtedness and remain as permanent\r\nrecords of his skill and originality.\r\n\r\nApproaching the period with which this review is more particularly\r\nconcerned, reference must now be made to the valuable labours of two\r\neminent men, whose loss the profession has had to mourn within recent\r\nyears. These are the late Professor Macquorn Rankine and the late Mr\r\nWilliam Froude, neither of whom was by profession a naval architect,\r\nyet both of whom were led by love of the subject to give their\r\nmatured experience as civil engineers and mathematical experts to the\r\npromotion of knowledge in this domain.\r\n\r\nRankine appears to have become specially interested in the problems\r\nconnected with ship design, after he became Professor of Civil\r\nEngineering at Glasgow University in 1855. Conjointly with Mr Isaac\r\nWatts, late Chief Constructor of the Navy, and formerly a student of\r\nthe first School of Naval Architecture; Mr F. K. Barnes, now Surveyor\r\nof Dockyards, and Chief Constructor of the Navy, and a distinguished\r\nstudent of the second school; and the late Mr J. R. Napier, a member\r\nof the famous Clyde shipbuilding firm, Prof. Rankine produced in 1866\r\n“Shipbuilding: Theoretical and Practical.” This valuable treatise was\r\nedited, and for the most part written, by Prof. Rankine, and provides\r\na complete system of information on all branches of shipbuilding\r\nand marine engineering, although subsequent progress in certain\r\ndepartments of naval science has made a new edition desirable. The\r\nwork is also distinguished for its enunciation of several theories\r\nconnected with the resistance and propulsion of vessels by Prof.\r\nRankine, which have become the accepted basis of modern practice.\r\nOf these the mechanical theory of the action of propellers, and\r\nthe stream-line theory of resistance, are the best known. His\r\ninvestigations and writings on the latter subject were most ably\r\nsupplemented and confirmed by Mr Froude, whose beautifully-contrived\r\nmodel experiments, coupled with his discovery of the law by which\r\nsuch experiments can be made to afford reliable data for the\r\nresistance of full-sized vessels, have laid the profession under even\r\na heavier load of indebtedness.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the only work of investigation and experiment\r\nwith which Mr Froude actively and inseparably identified himself.\r\nTaking up a subject which many authorities before him had studied and\r\nwritten upon with but little success—that of the phenomena of wave\r\nmotion and the oscillation of ships in a seaway—he propounded and\r\ndemonstrated at the Institution of Naval Architects in 1861, after\r\nmuch careful thought and experiment, a theory with respect to it\r\nwhich at that time was entirely new and striking, but which has since\r\nbeen firmly established as the sound one.\r\n\r\nAt first, authorities in the science of naval architecture, like\r\nMoseley and Dr Woolley, regarded the new theory with suspicion and\r\ndisapproval; Rankine, on the contrary, warmly supported it, and\r\nhelped to develop it and to answer various objections urged against\r\nthe hypothesis on which it was based. For nearly twenty years\r\nMr Froude steadily pursued the inquiry, adding one mathematical\r\ninvestigation to another, carrying out numerous experiments, and\r\nmaking voyages for the purpose of studying the behaviour of ships.\r\nBroadly speaking, it may be said that whereas earlier investigations\r\ngave to the naval architect the power of making estimates of the\r\nbuoyancy and stability of ships floating in smooth water, they gave\r\nup as altogether hopeless the attempt to predict the behaviour of\r\nships at sea, or to determine the causes which produce heavy rolling.\r\nOn the other hand, thanks to Mr Froude, the designer of a ship now\r\nknows what precautions to take in order to promote steadiness and\r\ngood behaviour at sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough the propositions enunciated by Mr Froude were accepted\r\nas laws in a wonderfully short time—considering their startling\r\nnature—their influence on practice, and especially the practical\r\napplication of the methods of comparison by which they had been\r\nestablished, have not even yet been brought to anything like their\r\nfull issue. The work is being continued upon the lines laid down\r\nby Mr Froude, amongst others by men whose closer intimacy with the\r\nactual affairs of the shipbuilding yard may be expected to yield\r\nresults which will be more immediately reflected in actual practice.\r\n\r\nPassing allusion has already been made to the founding of the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects, but an association which has\r\ngathered into its membership so largely of all sections of men\r\nconcerned with shipbuilding and shipping, and absorbs so much of the\r\nknowledge and talent in these domains, must have fuller reference\r\nmade to it. Regarding its foundation, in 1860, Mr White, in his\r\narticle in the _Westminster Review_, says:\r\n\r\n  “The scheme of the Institution was happily conceived and well\r\n  executed. Amongst its earliest members were found the trained naval\r\n  architects of the first and second Schools, the leading private\r\n  shipbuilders and marine engineers, the principal shipbuilding\r\n  officers of the Dockyards, men of science specially interested in\r\n  naval architecture, shipowners, merchants, and others connected\r\n  with shipping; while a considerable number of sailors from the\r\n  Royal Navy and Mercantile Marine showed their appreciation of the\r\n  value of naval science by becoming Associates. The list of names\r\n  is eminently representative. Sir John Pakington (afterwards Lord\r\n  Hampton), then only recently retired from the office of First\r\n  Lord of the Admiralty, was the first President. Many experienced\r\n  naval officers supported him. There were men like Watts, Read,\r\n  and Moorsom, who had been pupils of Dr Inman half a century\r\n  before; others, like Fairbairn, Laird, and Grantham, who had been\r\n  conversant with iron shipbuilding from its commencement; marine\r\n  engineering was worthily represented by veterans like Penn,\r\n  Maudslay, and Lloyd; mathematicians and men of science like Canon\r\n  Moseley, Dr Woolley, Professor Airy, and Mr Froude appear on the\r\n  list. Private shipbuilders and naval architects like Scott Russell,\r\n  Samuda, Napier, and White, joined in the movement, so did the\r\n  surveying staff of Lloyd’s Register. In fact, there was a general\r\n  appreciation of the endeavour to establish an association which\r\n  should enable all classes interested in shipping to interchange\r\n  ideas and experience with a view to general improvement. Mr Reed\r\n  was the first Secretary, retaining that post until he was appointed\r\n  Chief Constructor of the Navy, and in that position did much to aid\r\n  the progress of the Institution.”\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the membership list of the Institution in its\r\nearly days was of the representative character above indicated, it\r\nshould be pointed out that the actual proceedings of the Institution\r\nwere not shared in by anything like the variety of talent which the\r\nlist comprised, or which now distinguishes its annual meetings.\r\nFor many years it was almost the exclusive conference of Admiralty\r\nauthorities and members of those shipbuilding and engineering firms\r\nwho undertook Government work, and the transactions for a long time\r\nwere very largely confined to purely naval matters. The scientific\r\nvalue of the earlier volumes of the transactions would certainly have\r\nsuffered considerably if the papers by Mr Froude and Prof. Rankine\r\nhad not formed contributions, and the prosperity and development\r\nof the Institution would have been equally lessened had there not\r\nbeen general infusion of “new blood” from the mercantile marine in\r\nall parts of the country. This has been going on during the past\r\ntwelve years or more, and the scope and utility of the Institution’s\r\nproceedings have increased with the change. Of the later development\r\nof the Institution, the authority already quoted says:—\r\n\r\n  “Owing to the rapid advances constantly being made in both the\r\n  science and the practice of the profession, the ‘Transactions’ have\r\n  come to be the chief text-books available. Members and Associates\r\n  have joined from all the great maritime nations. Members of the\r\n  professional corps of naval architects and engineers of France,\r\n  Austria, Italy, Germany, the United States, Russia, Sweden, Norway,\r\n  Denmark, Holland, are proud to be numbered with their English\r\n  professional brethren, and not a few of these foreign members have\r\n  contributed valuable Papers. The meetings of the Institution afford\r\n  exceptional opportunities for the discussion of questions having\r\n  general interest, as well as others having more special value to\r\n  professional men. Different views of the same subject find capable\r\n  exponents, and lead to valuable discussions. The latest systems of\r\n  construction and most recent changes in _materiel_ are described by\r\n  competent authorities. Valuable _data_ are put on record relating\r\n  to the designs and performances of war-ships and merchant-ships.\r\n  Inventions of various kinds are described and examined. Abstruse\r\n  theoretical investigations are by no means rare; and, in many\r\n  cases, the contribution of one such Paper by an original thinker\r\n  has given a start to others and led to important extensions of\r\n  knowledge. In fact, the Institution of Naval Architects has\r\n  admirably fulfilled the intentions of its founders, acting as a\r\n  centre where valuable information could be collected, and whence\r\n  it could be distributed for the general benefit of the profession.\r\n  Before it was founded naval science had no home in England; its\r\n  treasures lay scattered far and wide in occasional Memoirs and\r\n  Papers; but now everything worth preservation naturally finds\r\n  its way to the ‘Transactions.’ Any movement affecting shipping\r\n  also leaves its record there in Papers and Discussions which will\r\n  hereafter have a high historical value.”\r\n\r\nAs evidencing the change which has latterly come over the Institution\r\nwith respect to its annual proceedings, it may be noted that whereas\r\nin the early years there were at some meetings no papers—leaving out\r\nof account those by Froude and Rankine—except by Admiralty members\r\nand others concerned with Government work, there was not a single\r\npaper by an Admiralty man during the meetings of the present year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the general reference already made to Mr Froude’s invaluable\r\nlabours in connection with the resistance of vessels the brief\r\nstatement of the agencies through which progress has been made during\r\nthe present century may be considered as brought down to the period\r\ncoming within the scope of the term “Modern,” as used in this work.\r\nThe more difficult task of chronicling the progress made during the\r\nperiod in question, both in the science of naval architecture purely,\r\nand in the application of science to practice, must now be attempted.\r\nThe plan upon which it is proposed to accomplish this is to show\r\nwherein and to what extent scientific methods in designing and\r\nobserving the behaviour of ships have been regarded, and indicating\r\ngenerally where still further improvement may be looked for. To\r\naccomplish this in such a way as to take appreciative account of the\r\nmost salient features, and yet to avoid difficult technical terms\r\nand unnecessary elaboration, may involve some omissions and slight\r\ninaccuracies, important enough from a strictly scientific point of\r\nview, yet which do not materially affect the faithfulness of the\r\nrecord.[5]\r\n\r\nAs preparing the way for references to those more special points in\r\nconnection with which scientific progress has taken place during\r\nrecent years, the following general and elementary outlines of the\r\nprincipal scientific problems in ship design and construction may be\r\nhelpful to many readers:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISPLACEMENT AND CARRYING CAPABILITY.\r\n\r\n  A vessel floating at rest displaces a volume of water whose weight\r\n  equals her own total weight.\r\n\r\n  For vessels floating in sea water the number of cubic feet of water\r\n  displaced per ton of weight is, as nearly as possible, thirty-five.\r\n  For vessels in fresh water—_i.e._, lakes or rivers—the cubic feet\r\n  per ton of weight is thirty-six.\r\n\r\n  By calculating the volume of under-water portion of the vessel’s\r\n  hull, the number of cubic feet displaced by the vessel when\r\n  floating at any given draught is obtained. This result, divided by\r\n  35 or 36, according as the water is salt or fresh, gives the number\r\n  of tons weight displaced, and consequently the total weight of the\r\n  vessel.\r\n\r\n  Calculations being made of the volume of the vessel’s hull to\r\n  intermediate distances between the keel and the maximum load line,\r\n  it is thus possible to construct a “curve of displacement” from\r\n  which the actual amount of displacement at any intermediate draught\r\n  can be obtained.\r\n\r\n  From this curve a set of scales—usually set up alongside a\r\n  vertical scale of feet and inches, representing the vessel’s\r\n  draught-marks—are constructed, showing—1st, the tons “displacement”\r\n  at any draught; 2nd, the tons of “dead-weight” capability—_i.e._,\r\n  the tons displacement due to the weight of cargo, coal, ballast,\r\n  stores, fresh water, spare gear, &c.—at any draught above the\r\n  vessel’s light-draught: “light-draught” being that at which the\r\n  vessel floats with holds clean-swept, bilges dry, water in boilers,\r\n  and with such spare gear on board as is required by Board of Trade;\r\n  and 3rd, the amount of “freeboard”—_i.e._, the distance in feet\r\n  and inches from any particular draught line to the top of the deck\r\n  amidships.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BUOYANCY AND STABILITY.\r\n\r\n  A ship floating upright and at rest in still water must fulfil two\r\n  conditions—1st, as stated above, she must displace, a weight of\r\n  water equal to her own weight; 2nd, her centre of gravity must lie\r\n  in the same vertical line with the centre of gravity of the volume\r\n  of displacement or “centre of buoyancy.”\r\n\r\n  The whole weight of the ship may be supposed to be concentrated at\r\n  her centre of gravity, and to act vertically downwards, and the\r\n  resultant vertical pressure of the surrounding water in the same\r\n  way to act upwards through the centre of buoyancy.\r\n\r\n  When the ship has been inclined from the upright position, by any\r\n  force, the downward and the upward forces—weight and buoyancy\r\n  respectively—act through two separate but parallel vertical\r\n  lines, and form what is technically known as a “couple.” The\r\n  perpendicular distance between the vertical lines usually varies\r\n  with the inclination, and is called the “arm” of the couple. This\r\n  arm measures the leverage with which the weight and buoyancy of the\r\n  ship tend either to force her back into the upright position, or\r\n  to incline her still further, and, it may be, to capsize her. The\r\n  former effect would be the result of what is known as a “righting\r\n  couple,” the latter the result of an “upsetting couple.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14. FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n  This may be made clearer by illustration. On Figs. 14 and 15,\r\n  which show in outline a vessel’s midship section, the vessel being\r\n  inclined to a small angle, =G= represents the centre of gravity\r\n  of vessel, and =B= the centre of buoyancy. The water line =W.L.=\r\n  corresponding to the upright position, in the inclined position\r\n  becomes =W_{1}.L_{1}.=, and the centre of buoyancy =B= shifts out\r\n  on the immersed side of the vessel to =B_{1}=. Assuming in the case\r\n  of Fig. 14 that some external force not involving any shifting of\r\n  the centre of gravity has produced the inclination, then the weight\r\n  of the vessel acts downwards through =G=, and the buoyancy of her\r\n  displacement acts upwards through =B_{1}=, as indicated by the\r\n  arrows passing through these points. The combined effect of these\r\n  forces, in this case, is to rotate the vessel towards the upright,\r\n  _i.e._, it forms a “righting couple.” Fig. 15 illustrates a case\r\n  of the opposite kind. The angle of inclination may be supposed to\r\n  be greater than in Fig. 14, and the centre of gravity =G= is much\r\n  higher in the vessel. The vertical through =B_{1}= is to the left\r\n  instead of to the right of the vertical through =G=. The effect of\r\n  the forces in this case is to rotate the vessel in the direction\r\n  of inclining her still further, and to capsize her—_i.e._, it\r\n  forms an “upsetting couple.” A line at =G=, therefore (Fig. 14),\r\n  taken at right angles to the new vertical line, gives the distance\r\n  which corresponds to the righting arm (=G= =Z=). A similar line at\r\n  =G= (Fig. 15) represents the upsetting arm. The lengths of these\r\n  arms when multiplied into the displacement, gives the “moments” at\r\n  the respective degrees of inclination. The “curve of stability”\r\n  for a vessel is simply a graphic representation of these arms or\r\n  moments. When calculated for the various degrees of inclination,\r\n  they are set off as ordinates along a base line—the righting arms\r\n  or moments above, and the upsetting arms or moments below, the\r\n  line—at distances corresponding to the number of degrees in the\r\n  respective inclinations. A curve drawn through the extremities of\r\n  these ordinates is the curve of stability.\r\n\r\n  The two points above named whose relative positions are vitally\r\n  concerned with this subject—_i.e._, centre of buoyancy and\r\n  centre of gravity—are determined by shipbuilders for many of\r\n  their vessels, although the stability may not be calculated\r\n  to its full extent. The position of the centre of buoyancy is\r\n  easily ascertained from, and in fact usually forms part of, the\r\n  displacement calculation. While the position of centre of gravity\r\n  may be found by means of calculation alone, _i.e._—by the process\r\n  of estimating the position of the centre of gravity of each of\r\n  the component parts, and from this deducing the common centre of\r\n  gravity of the whole ship—the work is so laborious, complex, and so\r\n  liable to error, that it is scarcely ever adopted at the present\r\n  day by mercantile shipbuilders. The position can be ascertained\r\n  with comparative ease and greater accuracy by means of “inclining”\r\n  experiments with the finished vessel, or closely estimated\r\n  before-hand by means of data obtained in the manner alluded to from\r\n  previous vessels of similar type.[6]\r\n\r\n  Another point concerned with stability is that termed the\r\n  “metacentre,” which is found by calculation from the lines of\r\n  the vessel. Referring to Fig. 14, a vertical line drawn through\r\n  the centre of buoyancy =B_{1}= cuts the original vertical line\r\n  at =M=. The intersection =M=, when the vessel is inclined to an\r\n  indefinitely small angle, is the “metacentre.” It is approximately\r\n  the same in all ordinary vessels for inclinations less than say\r\n  10°, but varies with greater inclinations. The corresponding\r\n  intersections of the consecutive vertical lines for all degrees\r\n  of inclination are embraced in the term “metacentrique.” These\r\n  features in stability investigations were originated by Bouguer, to\r\n  whom reference has already been made. The manner in which they are\r\n  concerned with stability will be indicated further on. (See also\r\n  footnote on preceding page.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  RESISTANCE POWER AND SPEED.\r\n\r\n  A ship, in moving through the water, experiences resistance due to\r\n  a combination of causes, which combination, according to modern\r\n  accepted theory, is made up of three principal elements.\r\n\r\n  1st—“Frictional” or “skin friction” resistance, due to the\r\n  particles of water rubbing against the ship’s hull;\r\n\r\n  2nd—“Eddy-making” resistance, due to local disturbances or eddies\r\n  amongst the particles of water—almost wholly at stern of ship;\r\n\r\n  3rd—Surface disturbance of the water by the passage of the ship,\r\n  resulting in the creation and maintenance of waves: known as\r\n  “wave-making” resistance.\r\n\r\n  The conditions which govern each of these elements, and their\r\n  relative importance, may be generally indicated.\r\n\r\n  Surface-friction resistance, especially for vessels moving at\r\n  moderate or slow speeds, is much greater than the resistance due\r\n  to other causes—that is if the hull is ordinarily well formed. Its\r\n  amount depends upon the area of the immersed surface, upon its\r\n  length, upon its degree of roughness, and upon the velocity with\r\n  which the water glides over it—_i.e._, upon the speed of the vessel.\r\n\r\n  Eddy-making resistance only acquires importance in exceptional\r\n  cases, _e.g._, in ships having unusually full sterns. In ordinary\r\n  well-formed ships it is of small amount, and is caused mainly by\r\n  blunt projections such as shaft tubes, propeller brackets, and\r\n  stern-posts.\r\n\r\n  Wave-making resistance is much more variable than surface-friction\r\n  resistance. Its amount depends on the form and proportions of\r\n  vessels, and on the speed at which they move: being greatest, of\r\n  course, in ships of full form and in those moving at high speeds.\r\n\r\n  The sum of these three main elements of resistance constitutes the\r\n  total resistance experienced by a vessel if “towed” through the\r\n  water, that is, the resistance considered apart from the action or\r\n  influence of the propelling instrument. In the case of a steamship,\r\n  however, propelled by a screw or paddle-wheels, the resistance\r\n  is augmented, more or less considerably, according to the form,\r\n  surface, and disposition of the propelling instrument.\r\n\r\n  By the employment of various formulæ deduced by scientific\r\n  authorities from theory and experiment, an approximation can be\r\n  made before-hand to the total resistance of a proposed vessel,\r\n  and from this an estimate of the power required to drive her at a\r\n  certain speed. Moreover, through the law of comparison propounded\r\n  by Mr Froude, the resistance of a ship can at all times be deduced\r\n  with fair accuracy from the resistance of her model, certain\r\n  corrections well determined by experiment having to be made.\r\n\r\n  The power of marine engines is expressed either in “nominal” or\r\n  “indicated” horse-power. Nominal horse-power is a term practically\r\n  obsolete so far as being a measure of the efficiency of engines,\r\n  and only exists as a conventional method of commercially measuring\r\n  the sizes of engines. Indicated horse-power measures the work\r\n  done by the steam in the cylinders during a unit of time, and\r\n  33,000 units of work per minute, or 550 units of work per second,\r\n  constitute one horse-power. The effective mean pressure of\r\n  the steam is ascertained from diagrams drawn by means of the\r\n  instrument known as the “Steam Engine Indicator,” and hence the\r\n  term “indicated” horse-power.\r\n\r\n  The development by a vessel’s engines of the power requisite to\r\n  drive her at a certain speed is always very considerably more\r\n  than the power required simply to overcome her total resistance\r\n  at that speed. This excess of power developed over power usefully\r\n  employed in overcoming resistance is known as “waste work.” It\r\n  amounts in many cases to as much as from 50 to 60 per cent. of the\r\n  gross indicated power, and it is absorbed mainly as follows:—In\r\n  overcoming frictional and other resistances of the engines and\r\n  shafting, working air pumps, &c., and in overcoming the frictional\r\n  and edgeways resistance of the propeller. The residue of power\r\n  usefully employed is known as the ‘effective’ horse-power. The\r\n  respective causes of ‘waste’ and their relative amounts are\r\n  problems constantly demanding solution. Progressive speed trials\r\n  with actual vessels and experiments with small scale models are\r\n  daily contributing to their solution, and to some extent to their\r\n  reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STRUCTURAL STRENGTH.\r\n\r\n  Considering a ship as floating in a state of rest in still water,\r\n  the volume of displacement represents a weight of water equal to\r\n  the weight of the ship. This equality, however, does not exist\r\n  evenly throughout the length of the vessel, or for individual\r\n  portions: thus, amidships the weight of water displaced by a\r\n  given length—in other words, the buoyancy—is usually considerably\r\n  in excess of the weight of that portion of the vessel and her\r\n  contents. Similarly at the extremities the ‘weight’ of a certain\r\n  length exceeds the ‘buoyancy.’ Between the part or parts of the\r\n  vessel in which there is excess of buoyancy over weight, and the\r\n  part or parts in which the weight exceeds the buoyancy, there must\r\n  obviously be sections of the ship at which the two are equal, and\r\n  these are termed “water borne” sections. A ship circumstanced as\r\n  described is in a condition similar to that of a beam supported\r\n  at the middle and loaded at each end. Such a beam tends to become\r\n  curved, the ends dropping relatively to the middle, and the ends of\r\n  the ship tend to drop similarly, the change of form being called\r\n  “hogging.” On the other hand, if the excess of buoyancy occurred\r\n  at the extremities and that of weight amidship, the ship would\r\n  resemble a beam supported at the ends and loaded at the middle. In\r\n  such a condition the middle would tend to drop relatively to the\r\n  ends: a change of form called “sagging.”\r\n\r\n  These general principles are much more readily and safely\r\n  applicable to ships while floating in ‘still water’ than to ships\r\n  when at sea—the strains experienced then being necessarily the\r\n  results of far more complex and severe influences. The existence of\r\n  waves and their rapid motions relatively to that of the vessel, and\r\n  the pitching, heaving, and other movements thus caused, increase\r\n  the inequality of distribution of weight and buoyancy and affect\r\n  more materially the strains brought upon vessels. Consideration of\r\n  the problem, therefore, involves a study of waves, both as to their\r\n  formation and action, and necessarily leads to a mode of treatment\r\n  which cannot have accurate regard for particular cases. Variable\r\n  influences of immense importance are also constituted by the state\r\n  of loading in vessels for merchant service. For a uniform basis of\r\n  comparison in these calculations such vessels are usually assumed\r\n  as loaded with homogeneous cargo—_i.e._, cargoes of equal density\r\n  throughout.\r\n\r\n  This fundamental element of relative ‘weight’ and ‘buoyancy’ having\r\n  been indicated, the chief strains to which a ship is subjected may\r\n  now be stated. This may be done with sufficient regard to general\r\n  accuracy, under four heads:—[7]\r\n\r\n    (1) Strains tending to produce longitudinal bending—“hogging” or\r\n    “sagging”—in the structure considered as a whole.\r\n\r\n    (2) Strains tending to alter the transverse form of a ship,\r\n    _i.e._, to change the form of athwartship sections.\r\n\r\n    (3) Strains incidental to propulsion by steam or sails.\r\n\r\n    (4) Strains affecting particular parts of a ship, or “local\r\n    strains”—tending to produce local damage or change of form\r\n    independently of changes in the structure considered as a whole.\r\n\r\n  To these might be added various other strains, which, however,\r\n  are of less practical importance, and are not felt in any\r\n  great degree—except in very special cases and under unusual\r\n  circumstances—apart from the strains which affect the structure\r\n  considered as a whole. The provisions made for the latter are,\r\n  under ordinary circumstances, sufficient to cover the demands of\r\n  the former, but particular cases may have to be provided for on\r\n  their merits, apart from the treatment generally applicable.\r\n\r\n  The manner of ascertaining the strength of a ship to resist\r\n  strains tending to produce longitudinal bending, is to compute\r\n  the effective sectional area of all the longitudinal items in the\r\n  structure which are brought under compressive or tensile strain,\r\n  and from this to calculate the strength in the same manner as for\r\n  a girder having an aggregate sectional area and a disposition of\r\n  material equivalent to that of the ship.\r\n\r\n  To ascertain the accurate maximum strains tending to produce\r\n  longitudinal bending, or, in excessive cases, to break the ship\r\n  across at the transverse section where the strains reach their\r\n  maximum, involves a careful and most laborious consideration of\r\n  the relative weight and buoyancy of individual sections throughout\r\n  the length, and is a task not generally undertaken in mercantile\r\n  shipyards.[8]\r\n\r\n  References to the nature of the transverse and other strains above\r\n  enumerated and the extent to which they have been investigated will\r\n  be made further on.\r\n\r\nWith regard to such fundamental properties of vessels as\r\ndisplacement, weight, and carrying capability, nothing new has\r\nfor a long period been added to the fund of scientific knowledge.\r\nOne of the conditions now most commonly laid down by the owners\r\nof a proposed ship is that which provides for a certain carrying\r\ncapability on a given draught of water and at a certain speed,\r\nthe principal dimensions of the vessel also being stipulated. The\r\nproblem of determining what total displacement will be required,\r\ninvolves consideration and an estimate of—1st, The total weight of\r\nhull having regard to structural strength; 2nd, the total weight of\r\nmachinery having regard to speed required. By using “co-efficients”\r\ndeduced from the weights of vessels of similar type already built,[9]\r\nthese are determined; and adding them to the carrying capability\r\nor dead-weight stipulated, the required displacement can be closely\r\napproximated to. For vessels of abnormal proportions or of very\r\nunusual construction careful and detailed calculations of the weight\r\nof materials are undertaken previous to tendering for them. In some\r\nyards, indeed, a like degree of care is observed in ordinary cases:\r\nmethods of approximation involving the use of co-efficients such as\r\nthat based on cubic capacity being distrusted.\r\n\r\nThe further problem of determining what form of hull will give the\r\nrequired displacement is the essential and all-embracing feature of\r\nthe work of design, as it involves consideration of almost all other\r\nproperties. The methods of designing ships are various, and a very\r\ncommon method, at one time more followed than it now is, consists\r\nin shaping a block model direct, and from it taking the necessary\r\nmeasurements for displacement, and for full-size delineation in\r\nthe moulding loft. The disadvantages pertaining to this somewhat\r\nantiquated method are becoming more recognised as shortened and exact\r\nmethods of linear or “draught plan” design are put forward.\r\n\r\nUnless the plan of lines of a similar vessel of nearly the same\r\ndimensions is at hand, the design of a new vessel is in many\r\ninstances done without previous calculation being made to ensure at\r\nonce obtaining the desired displacement. Special methods of quickly\r\narriving at this result are, however, not uncommon in mercantile\r\nshipyards, and generally speaking the chief draughtsmen in the employ\r\nof large firms doing a varied class of work have rules derived\r\nfrom long experience, though not perhaps definitely systematised,\r\nby which they are guided.[10] Irrespective of all such special\r\nmethods, however, the work of designing is now greatly shortened and\r\nsimplified by means of Amsler’s “planimeter,” an ingenious instrument\r\nfor measuring areas now becoming well known.[11] By employing the\r\ninstrument in question, the draughtsman need not too laboriously\r\nstrive after the exact displacement at first, as the time occupied\r\nin ascertaining what displacement any set of lines gives, and in the\r\nconsequent fining or filling out, is very considerably less than by\r\nthe ordinary methods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of stability, which has next to be considered, is one\r\nof great difficulty and intricacy, and it was not till the middle of\r\nlast century that some of the principles upon which it depends began\r\nto be understood. Bouguer showed in 1746 that the position of the\r\n“metacentre” limits the height to which the centre of gravity of a\r\nfloating body may be raised without making it unstable, and that the\r\nrighting moments at small angles of inclination from a position of\r\nstable equilibrium are proportional to the height of the metacentre\r\nabove the centre of gravity. As the position of the metacentre for\r\nany given draught of water is easily determinable when once the\r\nvolume of displacement and the centre of buoyancy at that draught\r\nhave been ascertained, it has been the practice for a very long time\r\nto construct a curve representing the height of the metacentre at\r\nall draughts, and to use it for showing the limits above which the\r\ncentre of gravity cannot be raised with due regard to the stability\r\nrequired for the practical working of vessels and for purposes of\r\nsafety: By the method of “inclining” vessels, already described (see\r\noutline of fundamental principles, page 98), the determination of the\r\nprecise position of the centre of gravity is rendered comparatively\r\nsimple.[12]\r\n\r\nWhile the vertical distance between the centre of gravity and the\r\nmetacentre—commonly termed the “metacentric height”—forms a measure\r\nof the “initial stability,” or the stability at very small angles of\r\ninclination, it is imperfect by itself, and may be very misleading\r\nas regards the stability at larger angles. This was conclusively\r\ndemonstrated by Atwood in his papers read before the Royal Society\r\nin 1796 and 1798, while other grounds for discrediting the standard\r\nof stability furnished by mere metacentric height were discovered\r\nsubsequently, and have been signally emphasised, with additional\r\nreasons, by recent occurrences. Atwood, in the papers referred to,\r\nlaid down a general theorem for determining the righting moments\r\nat any required angles of inclination possessed by a ship having a\r\ngiven draught of water and a fixed height of centre of gravity, the\r\nprinciple of which involved the use of the moments of the volumes\r\nof the “Wedges,” _i.e._, those parts of a vessel (see =W O W_{1}=,\r\n=L_{1} O L=, fig. 15), which become immersed and emerged as she\r\nis inclined. Several methods of simplifying Atwood’s calculations had\r\nbeen devised previous to 1861,[13] but in that year Mr F. K. Barnes,\r\nin a paper read before the Institution of Naval Architects, described\r\na method of accomplishing this which until within recent years has\r\nbeen the one ordinarily adopted in computing the stability of a\r\nvessel at various angles of inclination.[14]\r\n\r\nOwing to questions having arisen at the Admiralty in 1867 respecting\r\nthe stability of some low freeboard monitors at very large angles\r\nof inclination, Sir E. J. Reed, then Chief Constructor, directed\r\nthe matter to be investigated. The work was placed in the hands of\r\nMr William John, who embodied for the first time the results of the\r\ncalculations in the form of a curve of stability, which exhibited\r\nthe variations of righting moments with angles of inclination up to\r\nthe particular angle at which stability vanished. The entire range\r\nof a vessel’s stability was thus made evident, and in such a form\r\nas enabled the general problem to be far more comprehensively and\r\naccurately treated than before. The results of Mr John’s labours were\r\ndescribed in a paper read by Sir E. J. Reed before the Institution of\r\nNaval Architects in 1868, and a further paper, containing an improved\r\nmethod of applying Atwood’s theorem to the calculation of stability\r\nupon this extended scale, was read before the same Institution by\r\nMessrs John and W. H. White in 1871. The loss of H.M.S. _Captain_,\r\nin 1870, as already pointed out near the beginning of this chapter,\r\noccasioned an immediate and serious regard for the stability of war\r\nvessels. This disaster, with other losses at sea from instability,\r\nalso forcibly directed the attention of mercantile naval architects\r\nto the subject, and investigations on the same complete scale as\r\nthose undertaken in the Admiralty have for some years been adopted in\r\na few leading mercantile shipyards.\r\n\r\nIn this way the peculiar dangers attaching to low freeboard,\r\nespecially when associated with a high centre of gravity, have been\r\npretty fully made known, but the character of the stability which\r\nis often to be found associated with very light draught appears to\r\nhave escaped the attention it demands. Light draught is often as\r\nunfavourable to stability as low freeboard, and in some cases more so.\r\n\r\nThese truths were forced into prominence at the inquiry held by Sir\r\nE. J. Reed on behalf of the Government into the disaster which befell\r\nthe _Daphne_, a screw-steamer of 460 tons gross register, which\r\ncapsized in the middle of the Clyde immediately on being launched\r\nfrom the yard of the builders, Messrs Alexander Stephen & Sons,\r\nLinthouse, on July 3rd, 1883. Sir E. J. Reed, in his exhaustive\r\nreport, published in August, 1883, emphasised the lessons adduced at\r\nthe inquiry as to the peculiar dangers attaching to light-draught\r\nstability; and Mr Francis Elgar, (now Professor of Naval Architecture\r\nin Glasgow University), who was employed to make investigations\r\nrespecting the stability possessed by the _Daphne_ at the time of the\r\ndisaster, did much to guide consideration of the subject into this\r\nchannel. In a letter to the _Times_ on 1st September, 1883, Mr Elgar,\r\nby way of explaining portions of his evidence at the inquiry, called\r\nattention to the relation which exists between the righting moments\r\nat deep and light draughts in certain elementary forms of floating\r\nbodies, his communication throwing further light on the subject of\r\nlight-draught stability. It appears that the fundamental proposition\r\nwhich underlies the variations in the stability of a floating\r\nbody with draught of water had never before been demonstrated or\r\nenunciated.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that a curve of stability for a\r\ngiven draught of water and position of centre of gravity ceases to be\r\napplicable if changes are made in the weight and consequent draught\r\nof water of a ship or the position of the centre of gravity, or in\r\nboth. Now in mercantile steamers, from the extremely light condition\r\nin which they are launched to the uncertain loaded condition of their\r\ndaily service as cargo-carriers, the variation of draught is very\r\nconsiderable, and imports into the subject considerations which do\r\nnot obtain to any great extent in war ships.\r\n\r\nTo complete the representation of stability as it should be known\r\nfor merchant ships, it is now recognised that curves showing the\r\nstability at every possible draught of water and for different\r\npositions of centre of gravity should be constructed. By means of\r\n“cross-curves” of stability, or curves representing the variation\r\nof righting moment, with draught of water at fixed angles of\r\ninclination, this comprehensive want can be met with something like\r\nthe necessary expedition. From such curves it is a simple operation,\r\ninvolving no calculation save measurement, to construct curves of\r\nthe ordinary description, showing the righting moment at all angles\r\nfor any fixed draught of water and position of centre of gravity.\r\nProfessor Elgar was the first to publicly direct attention to this\r\nvaluable development of stability investigation of merchant ships,\r\ndoing so in an able paper “On the Variation of Stability with Draught\r\nof Water in Ships,” read before the Royal Society on March 13th of\r\nthe present year. Simultaneously with Prof. Elgar’s employment of\r\nsuch curves in actual practice their use had been independently\r\ninstituted by Mr William Denny in his firm’s drawing office, and the\r\nmode in which they were worked out in this case was communicated in\r\na paper read by Mr Denny in April of the present year before the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects.[15] Several important improvements\r\nwith respect to simplifying and shortening calculation distinguish\r\nthe method employed by Mr Denny, and that gentleman, in the paper\r\nreferred to, accords individual credit to members of the scientific\r\nstaff in his firm’s employ, who, on being entrusted with the work\r\nof calculation, brought considerable originality to bear upon their\r\nlabours. The cross-curves described by Prof. Elgar were constructed\r\nfrom a series of curves of stability calculated in the ordinary way.\r\nThis, however (as pointed out in an after-note to that gentleman’s\r\nRoyal Society paper), is less simple and very much less expeditious\r\nthan the method carried out under Mr Denny, which consists in\r\ncalculating the cross-curves directly by applying Amsler’s mechanical\r\nintegrator[16] to the under-water portion of the ship instead of to\r\nthe wedges of immersion and emersion, thus determining at once the\r\npositions of the vertical lines through the centres of buoyancy at\r\nthe required angles of inclination. As thus carried out a complete\r\nset of cross-curves can be produced with about one-third the labour\r\ninvolved in employing the older method. The ease and rapidity with\r\nwhich ordinary curves for separate draughts can be taken from\r\ncross-curves has already been commented upon.\r\n\r\nMany other investigators besides those already mentioned have\r\nrecently been working at the subject of stability, and a\r\nconsiderable number have read papers, dealing with the extension and\r\nsimplification of stability calculations, before one or other of the\r\nscientific societies concerned with naval architecture, most of the\r\nmethods put forward being well worthy of study.[17] To very many\r\nshipbuilders, however, and to others besides them responsible for\r\nthe stability of ships, processes of arithmetical calculation—even\r\nallowing for all the simplification which mathematical skill has\r\nrecently effected—appear still to be too intricate, or to absorb too\r\nmuch time for their being entirely followed. As a simple means of\r\nreadily, although approximately, arriving at the results attained\r\nmore elaborately and reliably by calculation, attention has recently\r\nbeen directed to an experimental process by which a complete curve\r\nof stability may be constructed almost without the use of a single\r\nfigure! The method was first brought forward in 1873 by Capt. H. A.\r\nBlom, chief constructor of the Norwegian Navy, formerly a student of\r\nthe South Kensington School of Naval Architecture, who described it\r\nto the United Service Institution. The method has been employed by\r\nshipbuilding firms on the Tyne and Clyde when a curve of stability\r\nhad to be produced in a very limited time, and when extreme accuracy\r\nwas not a desideratum. As practised by the firms in question, the\r\n_modus operandi_ differs in some slight respects from that described\r\nby Captain Blom, but the changes in no way affect the principles as\r\nfirst laid down by him. The modern mode of procedure may be briefly\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\n  From the body plan of the ship, _i.e._, that portion of the draught\r\n  plan representing the vessel’s form by a series of equidistant\r\n  transverse sections—any convenient number of sections lip to the\r\n  load water-line are pricked upon and then cut out of a sheet of\r\n  drawing paper of uniform thickness. These sections are then gummed\r\n  together in their correct relative positions, care being taken\r\n  to spread the gum thinly and evenly. This paper model—greatly\r\n  foreshortened, of course—represents the immersed portion of the\r\n  ship (in other words, the displacement) when she is floating\r\n  upright. By suspending this model from two different points, and\r\n  taking the intersection of two vertical lines through the points of\r\n  suspension—or better still, by balancing it horizontally on a pin\r\n  and fixing the point when the model is in equilibrium—the centre\r\n  of gravity of the model, or in other words, the actual centre of\r\n  buoyancy is obtained.\r\n\r\n  Water lines at various angles of inclination are then drawn on\r\n  the body plan, all intersecting the water line for the upright\r\n  condition at the centre line of ship. The displacement represented\r\n  by the inclined water lines thus drawn, generally not being equal\r\n  to that for the upright position, a correcting layer has to be\r\n  added or subtracted for each inclination, in order to obtain this\r\n  end. By employing the planimeter the necessary thickness of this\r\n  layer can be most readily ascertained. Where a planimeter is not\r\n  available the actual floating line may be obtained, after the model\r\n  has been made, by cutting off layers, allowance having been made\r\n  for this purpose. The same number of sections as before are then\r\n  cut out to each of the inclined corrected water-lines, the paper\r\n  model prepared and the centre of buoyancy obtained as already\r\n  described.\r\n\r\n  Through this new centre of buoyancy a line is drawn perpendicular\r\n  to the inclined water line, and the distance between this line\r\n  and the centre of gravity of the ship, already obtained, is the\r\n  righting arm. If this process is repeated for each angle of\r\n  inclination, it is thus seen a complete curve of stability may be\r\n  approximately obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. MODEL IN UPRIGHT POSITION ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. MODEL IN INCLINED POSITION]\r\n\r\nA further method of arriving at results by experiment, involving\r\nprinciples not unlike those of the “paper section” method just\r\ndescribed, has recently come under the author’s notice, and through\r\nthe courtesy of its inventor—Mr John H. Heck, of Lloyd’s surveying\r\nstaff at Newcastle—the following general description of the apparatus\r\nand fundamental principles is made public for the first time:—\r\n\r\n  By means of a “stability balance,” roughly illustrated by Figs 16\r\n  and 17, in conjunction with either an outside or inside model of\r\n  the vessel, the moments of stability can be practically determined.\r\n  In practice, an inside model has been found the most convenient to\r\n  employ. This consists of a number of rectangular pieces of yellow\r\n  pine of any uniform thickness, out of which a portion has been cut,\r\n  respectively to the form of the vessel at equidistant intervals of\r\n  say 15 feet. These pieces, together with two end pieces, are kept\r\n  together by four or six bolts, thus forming a contracted model, the\r\n  inside of which is of a similar form to that of the vessel. If\r\n  this model is filled with water to a height corresponding to any\r\n  draught, it will represent a volume of water having the same form,\r\n  and proportional to the displacement of the vessel at that draught.\r\n\r\n  The stability balance consists of a frame =A= attached to a steel\r\n  bar =Z=, having knife edges working upon the support =C=; a table\r\n  =D= attached to a spindle working freely in the bearings =E=, and\r\n  capable of being turned through any angle; a sliding weight =F= to\r\n  balance the weight of the model when empty; a sliding weight =H=\r\n  to balance and measure the weight of the water contained in inside\r\n  or displaced by outside models; a sliding balance weight =K= which\r\n  by adjustment will locate the centre of gravity of the combined\r\n  weights of the table =D=, the model and the weight =K= in the axis\r\n  of the table =D=, so that the model will remain when empty in any\r\n  inclined position, and be balanced by the weight =F=.\r\n\r\n  In order to determine the moments of stability, the model is first\r\n  fixed on the table =D=, and the weights =F= and =K= so adjusted\r\n  that =F= will balance the model at all inclinations. The table is\r\n  then brought into the upright position, and water is poured into\r\n  the model to the height corresponding to the desired draught of\r\n  water, and the weight =H= shifted until the whole is balanced.\r\n  The weight of water in the model will evidently be = weight =H= ×\r\n  its distance from the fulcrum ÷ distance centre of model is from\r\n  fulcrum.\r\n\r\n  If the table with the model is now turned through any angle, the\r\n  distance the centre of gravity of the water has moved from the axis\r\n  =E= of the table can easily be determined by shifting the weight\r\n  =H= until the whole is balanced, then evidently from the principles\r\n  of the lever, =H= × by its distance from fulcrum = weight of water\r\n  in model × by the distance the centre of gravity of the water in\r\n  the model is from fulcrum. Since the weight of =H= × its distance\r\n  from fulcrum ÷ the weight of water in model is known, the distance\r\n  that the centre of gravity of the water has shifted from centre\r\n  line is easily ascertained and the righting lever determined.\r\n\r\nFrom a lengthened series of experiments, conducted by Mr\r\nHeck—latterly in Messrs Denny’s Works where an apparatus from a\r\nspecial design by Mr Heck has been constructed for the firm’s use—the\r\nmethod gives promise of taking a firm place as an extremely simple\r\nand approximately accurate means of arriving at the stability of\r\nvessels.[18]\r\n\r\nWhile a vessel’s qualities with respect to stability may be\r\ndetermined with great precision by the naval architect, his\r\ninvestigations are only directly applicable to the ship while empty\r\nor when in certain assumed conditions of loading which may or may\r\nnot often occur in actual service. He cannot for obvious reasons\r\nestimate, far less control, the amounts and positions of centre\r\nof gravity of the various items of weight that may make up the\r\nloading.[19] This aspect of the subject has received attention at the\r\nhands of naval architects for a considerable time, but the forcible\r\nway in which it has been brought under view by recent experience\r\nhas resulted in special efforts being made to practically meet the\r\nnecessities of the case. In 1877 Mr William John read a paper before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects, in which he dealt with the\r\neffect of stowage on the stability of vessels, and since that time\r\nsuch authorities as Martell, White, and Denny have given valuable\r\npapers or made suggestive comments bearing on this important matter.\r\nMuch has also been done by several builders in the way of devising\r\ndiagrams useful for regulating stowage and manipulating ballast with\r\nregard to initial stability. At the last meeting of the Institution,\r\nProfessor Elgar read a paper on “The Use of Stability Calculations\r\nin Regulating the Loading of Steamers,” distinguished by its\r\neminently practical character, and forming an important contribution\r\nto the solution of this problem. The author disapproved of curves\r\nof stability being supplied with vessels, as had been advised and\r\nwas then becoming the practice. General notes, giving in a simple\r\nform easily applied in daily practice, particulars respecting the\r\ncharacter of a ship’s stability in different conditions, are what\r\nthe author recommended and had found through actual experience to\r\nmeet the case most effectually. In the discussion which followed\r\nit was intimated by Mr William Denny that his firm had already\r\nresolved to furnish every new steamer produced by them with a volume\r\ncontaining general and special notes and diagrams dealing not only\r\nwith stability but with several other important technical properties\r\n(see footnote, page 59). After consultation with Professor Elgar,\r\nhowever, he had abandoned his intention of supplying stability curves.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement designed to readily find the position of the centre\r\nof gravity experimentally by inclining, and to indicate at once the\r\nstability of loaded vessels as represented by metacentric height, has\r\nbeen devised and introduced on board several ships by Mr Alexander\r\nTaylor, of Newcastle—already referred to in connection with the\r\ntriple expansion principle in marine engines. The instrument and\r\napparatus, which he appropriately names the “Stability Indicator,”\r\nwas described in a paper read by him before the Institution of Naval\r\nArchitects at its last meeting. When once an inclining operation\r\nhas been made, the degree of inclination is read from a glass gauge\r\nand the position of centre of gravity and corresponding metacentric\r\nheight from a previously prepared scale set up alongside the gauge,\r\nor from tabulated figures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe advance made within recent years in connection with steam\r\npropulsion comprises many matters necessarily left unconsidered in\r\nthe chapter on speed and power of modern steamships. Scientific\r\nmethods have undoubtedly contributed in no small degree to the\r\nrealization of the remarkable results therein outlined. The\r\nachievement of one triumph after another as demonstrated in the\r\nactual performances of new vessels, and especially the confidence\r\nwith which pledges of certain results are given and received long\r\nbefore actual trials are entered upon—and that sometimes with regard\r\nto ships embodying very novel features—are evidences of the truth of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe oldest method of approximating to the horse-power required\r\nto propel a proposed vessel at a given speed is to compare the\r\nnew ship with ships already built by the use of formulæ known\r\nas “co-efficients of performance” deduced from the results of\r\ntheir speed trials. Two such co-efficients have been deduced from\r\nAdmiralty practice, the one involving displacement, the other area of\r\nmid-section, with speed as the variable in both cases. Another method\r\nwhich has been largely used, consists in first determining the ratio\r\nof the indicated horse-power to the amount of “wetted surface,” or\r\nimmersed portion of the vessel’s skin, in the exemplar ship, and then\r\nestimating from this ratio the probable value of the corresponding\r\nratio for the proposed ship at her assigned speed. Inasmuch as these\r\nmethods of procedure do not take account of the _forms_ of the hulls,\r\nand consequently of that factor in the total resistance due to\r\n_wave-making_, they cannot be used with any degree of confidence, or\r\nwithout large corrections, except in connection with vessels whose\r\nspeeds are moderate in proportion to their dimensions: those in fact\r\nin which the resistance varies nearly as the square of the speed. A\r\nfurther method, somewhat resembling the one based upon the relation\r\nbetween indicated horse-power and the “wetted surface,” was proposed\r\nby the late Prof. Rankine, but has never been extensively employed.\r\nApart from the unreliable nature of the results which an application\r\nof it gives—except for certain speeds—it is open to several serious\r\nobjections in practice.\r\n\r\nA method of analysis and prediction, meeting with considerable\r\nacceptance from shipbuilders on the Clyde and elsewhere, has been\r\nintroduced within recent years by Mr A. C. Kirk, of Messrs R. Napier\r\n& Sons.[20] The method consists in reducing all vessels to a definite\r\nand simple form, such as readily admits of comparison being made\r\nbetween their immersed surface, length of entrance and angle of\r\nentrance and their indicated horse-power, and from this judging of\r\nthe form and proportions best suited to a given speed or power in\r\nproposed vessels. The form in question consists of a block model,\r\nhaving a rectangular midship section, parallel middle body, and\r\nwedge-shaped ends; its length being proportioned to that of the ship,\r\nits depth to the mean draught of water, its girth of mid-section\r\nto the girth of immersed mid-section of the ship, and the surface\r\nof its sides, bottom and ends, to the immersed surface of the ship.\r\nBy finding from one or more exemplar ships—the selection of which\r\nis obviously governed by the conditions of analysis—the rate of\r\nindicated horse-power required per unit of wetted surface at the\r\nspeed assigned for the proposed vessel, the appropriate rate for the\r\nlatter may easily be determined.\r\n\r\nThe data afforded by the modern system of progressive speed trials,\r\nespecially when taken in conjunction with that of experiment with\r\nmodels as systematised by Mr Froude, supplies in a reliable way\r\nmuch of what is most lacking in the older methods of comparison and\r\nprediction. Progressive speed trials on the measured mile were first\r\nsystematically instituted by Mr William Denny about nine years ago,\r\nsince which it has been the practice of his firm to make such trials\r\nwith all their vessels. The practice has been followed by other firms\r\non the Clyde and elsewhere, and there is every probability it will\r\nbe still more widely adopted in the future. The system consists in\r\ntrying the vessel at various speeds, ranging from the highest to\r\nabout the lowest of which she is capable. The several speeds are the\r\nmean of two runs—one run with the tide and one against, the object\r\nbeing to eliminate the tide’s influence from the results.[21]\r\n\r\nEssentially noteworthy in connection with the system is the manner\r\nin which the data obtained from the trials is recorded for future\r\nuse. This consists of a series of curves, representing the chief\r\nproperties of ship, engines, and propeller—_e.g._, “speed and power,”\r\n“revolutions” and “slip”—which show to the eye, more easily and\r\nclearly than bare figures, the whole course and value of a steamer’s\r\nperformances. For that of speed and power the various speeds made at\r\nthe trials are set off to convenient scale as horizontal distances,\r\nand the indicated horse-power corresponding to those speeds are set\r\noff to scale as vertical distances. The intersection of the offsets\r\nso made, give spots for the curve. The other curves alluded to are\r\nsimilarly constructed, the requisite data being the direct or deduced\r\nresults of the measured mile trials.\r\n\r\nFrom the accumulation of trial results thus graphically recorded\r\nthe designer of new ships can proceed to estimate with greater\r\nassurance of attaining satisfactory results than by employing the\r\nolder methods. If, for example, a ship is to be built of virtually\r\nsimilar dimensions and form to one for which such information is\r\navailable, but of less speed, the task is simply one of measurement\r\nfrom the curves, with some allowance for probable differences in\r\nthe constant friction of the engines. If the speed is to be greater\r\nthan that of the exemplar ship, but still within the limits when\r\nwave-making resistance assumes relative importance, the case is also\r\none of simple reading from the curves, with slight corrections.\r\nWhen both the speed and size are different, but the form is\r\napproximately the same, the case is more difficult, but it can be\r\ndealt with approximately by employing the “law of comparison” or of\r\n“corresponding speeds” enunciated by Mr Froude. Formulæ based upon\r\nthis law—which will be more fully referred to presently—have been\r\ndevised by one or two designers, and applied by them to problems of\r\nthe latter class as they occurred in the course of their professional\r\nwork. Mr John Inglis, junr., described a method of analysis he had\r\nadopted, involving the use of Mr Froude’s law, in a paper read before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects in 1877.\r\n\r\nWhen unusual speeds are aimed at, or when novel types of vessels have\r\nto be dealt with, the only available method of making a trustworthy\r\nestimate of the power required lies in the use of direct or\r\ndeduced results from model experiments. Mr Froude began the work\r\nof speed experiments with ships’ models on behalf of the Admiralty\r\nat the Experimental Tank in Torquay about 1872, carrying it on\r\nuninterruptedly until his death in May, 1879. Since that lamented\r\nevent the work has been continued with most gratifying results by his\r\nson, Mr R. E. Froude. Experiments had, of course, been made by many\r\nother investigators previous to Mr Froude, but none before or since\r\nhave made model experiments so practically useful and reliable. Since\r\nthe value of the work carried on at Torquay has become appreciated,\r\nseveral experimental establishments of a similar character have been\r\ninstituted. The Dutch Government, in 1874, formed one at Amsterdam,\r\nwhich, up till his death in 1883, was under the superintendence of\r\nDr Tideman, whose labours in this direction were second only to\r\nthose of the late Mr Froude. It is now superintended by Mr A. J. H.\r\nBeeloo, Chief Constructor, and under him by Mr H. Cop. It was here,\r\nit may be remembered, that experiments were made with a model of the\r\nCzar of Russia’s yacht _Livadia_, previous to the construction of\r\nthat extraordinary vessel being begun by Messrs Elder & Co. On the\r\nstrength of the data so obtained, together with the results of the\r\ntrials made on Loch Lomond with a miniature of the actual vessel,\r\nthose responsible for her stipulated speed were satisfied that it\r\ncould be attained. The actual results as to the speed of the novel\r\nvessel amply justified the reliance put upon such experiments. In\r\n1877 the French naval authorities established an experimental tank\r\nin the dockyard at Brest, and the Italian Government have formed\r\none in the naval dockyard at Castellamare. The only experimental\r\ntank hitherto established by a private mercantile firm is that in\r\nthe shipyard of Messrs Denny, Dumbarton. This establishment is on a\r\nscale of completeness not surpassed elsewhere, and is fitted with\r\nevery appliance which the latest experience in such experiments shows\r\nto be advantageous. A special staff of experimentalists, forming\r\na branch of the general scientific body, are engaged conducting\r\nexperiments and accumulating data, which, besides being of service in\r\ntheir present daily practice, must ultimately yield fruit of a very\r\nspecial kind to this enterprising firm.[22]\r\n\r\nFrom mathematical reasoning, and by means of an extended series of\r\nexperiments with models and actual ships, Mr Froude determined that\r\nfor two vessels of similar form—for instance a ship and her model—the\r\n“corresponding speeds” of ship and model are to one another as the\r\nsquare roots of the similar dimensions, and at corresponding speeds\r\nthe resistance of ship and of model are to one another as the cubes\r\nof the similar dimensions—subject to a correction concerned with skin\r\nfriction necessitated by the difference in the lengths of ship and\r\nmodel.[23] Having obtained the resistance of a model, and from it,\r\nby an application of the above law, deduced the resistance of the\r\nfull-sized vessel, the effective horse-power is found by multiplying\r\nthe resistance by the speed of the vessel in feet per minute, and\r\ndividing by 33,000. From the effective horse-power an estimate of the\r\nindicated horse-power required can be made by using ratios which the\r\none bore to the other in former ships, as obtained from a comparison\r\nof their model experiments with their measured mile trial results.\r\n\r\nThe value of progressive speed trials and of experiments with models\r\nas affording convenient means whereby analysis may be made of the\r\nseveral sources of expenditure of power in propelling vessels can\r\nscarcely be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the graphic records of progressive trials, and from\r\nmodel experiment results, Mr Froude discovered a method whereby the\r\npower expended in overcoming the frictional resistance of the engines\r\ncould be determined, and estimates made of the amount of power\r\nabsorbed by other elements. The method in question was communicated\r\nin full in a paper read before the Institution of Naval Architects\r\nin 1876, and has since been extensively used. Methods of analysis\r\nresulting from a simultaneous study of this subject, were also\r\nproposed by Mr Robert Mansel, a prominent Clyde shipbuilder and noted\r\ninvestigator, but they failed in meeting with the acceptance which\r\nwas at once accorded to Mr Froude’s propositions.[24]\r\n\r\nAlthough the results obtained by an application of Mr Froude’s\r\nanalysis to the trials of a large number of merchant vessels have\r\nundoubtedly thrown considerable light on the relative efficiency of\r\nhull and engines, and of various types of engines, still, for several\r\nreasons adduced by extended experience—most of which, indeed, were\r\nforeseen and perfectly appreciated by Mr Froude himself—the need has\r\nbeen felt for some means of directly measuring the power actually\r\ndelivered to the propellers by the engines when working at different\r\nspeeds. One of Mr Froude’s latest inventions, the perfecting of\r\nwhich was not accomplished until after his death, consisted of a\r\ndynamometric apparatus designed to accomplish this important end.[25]\r\nThe construction of the instrument was undertaken for the Admiralty,\r\nand trials were made with it on H.M.S. _Conquest_ in the early part\r\nof 1880. The results of these experiments have not yet in any form\r\nbeen recorded, but there can be no question as to the benefit that\r\nwould accrue to the profession if the Admiralty could be induced to\r\npublish these, as well as the results of other experiments with this\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nExperiments with actual vessels to determine directly the relative\r\nefficiency of hull, engines, and propellers have on several occasions\r\nbeen undertaken. A series of trials of this nature were made in 1874\r\nby Chief-Engineer Isherwood, U.S. Navy on a steam launch, the results\r\nof which may be found detailed in the Report of the Secretary of U.S.\r\nNavy for 1875. Similar trials have been made recently on the United\r\nStates steamer _Albatros_, an interesting account of which appeared\r\nin _Engineering_ of October 17 of the present year. These experiments\r\nare referred to as notable examples of what might be carried out\r\nwith great advantage on other and larger vessels, although they are\r\nsuch, perhaps, as few single firms can well be expected to follow\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\nThe economies which may be obtained by changes in the propellers\r\nfitted to ships, and the great value of progressive speed trials\r\nas a means of measuring the effects of such changes, received most\r\nremarkable illustration in the results of the trials of H.M.S.\r\n_Iris_, carried out for the Admiralty in 1880. These showed that\r\nby simply varying the propellers—all other conditions remaining\r\npractically unchanged—the speed of the ship was increased from 16½\r\nto 18½ knots per hour. Scarcely less striking improvements in the\r\nperformances of vessels due to changed propellers might be found from\r\nthe records of trials made with merchant vessels within recent years.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as measured mile trials are usually carried out when vessels\r\nare in the light or partially loaded condition, the results are far\r\nfrom being so valuable as they might be made; alike for the purposes\r\nof the naval architect, the shipowner, and ships’ officers; if they\r\nwere undertaken with vessels in the completely laden condition. The\r\ninformation obtained from the trials of incompletely laden vessels\r\ndoes not yield that knowledge of a vessel’s qualities under the\r\nconditions necessarily imposed by actual service, which, if possessed\r\nby naval architects, would doubtless prove of immense value, nor\r\ndoes it furnish that standard of comparison for performances at sea\r\nwhich owners and captains should possess. In the interests of all\r\nconcerned, it is to be hoped the practice of trying loaded vessels\r\nmay become more common.\r\n\r\nAmongst the earliest and most notable investigations involving the\r\napplication of principle to the calculation of the longitudinal\r\nstrength of iron vessels were those by Sir William Fairbairn,\r\nwho contributed an elaborate statement of his views and methods\r\nto the first meeting of the Institute of Naval Architects in\r\n1860. Investigation up till about this period, almost wholly\r\nconcerned itself with vessels considered as girders, and in assumed\r\nconditions of fixed support, such as being pivoted on rocks. Later\r\ninvestigations have shown these conditions to be altogether too\r\nextreme and severe when compared with the known and estimated strains\r\nwhich vessels are called upon to bear in ordinary service. In 1861\r\nMr J. G. Lawrie, of Glasgow, in an able paper on Lloyd’s rules,\r\nread before the Scottish Shipbuilders’ Association,[26] reasoning\r\nfrom wave phenomenon and the probable effects attending motion\r\nin a seaway, endeavoured to deduce limits or absolute values for\r\nthe extreme strains experienced by a vessel in the circumstances,\r\nthe results obtained by Mr Lawrie bearing very closely on those\r\ndeduced by later investigations. The late Professor Rankine made\r\ninvestigations involving consideration of strains in a seaway, and\r\nformulated several valuable rules which to some extent are still\r\naccepted, although giving results which are not likely to be exceeded\r\nin any case of ordinary service.[27]\r\n\r\nFor the most recent advances made in this important branch of the\r\nscience of naval architecture, the profession lies under indebtedness\r\nchiefly to one or two naval architects of eminent ability, whose\r\nprofessional province for a time has lain more especially in the way\r\nof a full consideration of the subject. Sir E. J. Reed, while Chief\r\nConstructor of the Navy, and under him several Government-trained\r\nnaval architects subsequently acquiring high positions, achieved\r\nmuch in accurate investigation of iron-clad vessels of war. In\r\n1870 the authority named read an elaborate paper before the Royal\r\nSociety dealing at length with such work.[28] In 1874 Mr William\r\nJohn, formerly under Sir E. J. Reed, but at that time Assistant\r\nChief Surveyor to Lloyd’s Register, read a valuable paper before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects, in which he gave the results\r\nof investigations of specific cases, and of long and careful study\r\nof the general problem as concerned with merchant vessels. In this\r\npaper, Mr John advanced the proposition that the maximum bending\r\nmoment likely to be experienced on a wave crest may be taken\r\napproximately as one thirty-fifth of the product of the weight of the\r\nship into her length. Proceeding on this assumption Mr John’s paper\r\nfurther gave valuable results of calculations made into the strength\r\nof a series of vessels representing large numbers of mercantile\r\nsteamers then afloat.[29] Of this paper and the conclusions it\r\npointed to, Mr John, in a later paper on “Transverse and other\r\nStrains of Ships,” said:—\r\n\r\n  “The investigations showed unmistakably that as ships increased in\r\n  size a marked diminution occurred in their longitudinal strength,\r\n  and the results caused some surprise at the time, although they\r\n  might perhaps have been easily inferred from the writings of\r\n  others published at an earlier period. Those results, in spite of\r\n  their approximate character, impressed two conclusions strongly\r\n  on my mind: firstly, that there was cause for anxiety as to the\r\n  longitudinal strength of some very large iron steamers then\r\n  afloat, and that the longitudinal strength of large ships needed on\r\n  all hands the most careful vigilance and attention; and secondly,\r\n  that in small vessels, and even vessels of moderate dimensions, the\r\n  longitudinal strength need cause but little anxiety, because it is\r\n  amply provided for by the scantlings found necessary to fulfil the\r\n  other requirements of a sea-going trade.”\r\n\r\nUsing the formula as to the maximum bending moment advanced by\r\nMr John many investigations have been made subsequently into the\r\nlongitudinal strength of vessels, and this increased interest in the\r\nsubject has not been without its effect on subsequent structural\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nMr John followed up his investigations on the longitudinal strength\r\nof merchant vessels viewed as girders by an inquiry into the\r\ntransverse and other strains of ships, and in 1877 gave a valuable\r\npaper on the subject, from which a quotation has already been made,\r\nbefore the Institution of Naval Architects. The results of Mr\r\nJohn’s inquiry were such as demonstrated the need for systematic\r\nand thorough investigation of the subtle and intricate questions\r\ninvolved. This subject has been matter of study at Lloyd’s Register\r\nfor several years, and in March, 1882, the results of inquiries\r\nconducted by Mr T. C. Bead and Mr P. Jenkins, members of the staff in\r\nLondon, and former students of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich,\r\nwere communicated in an able paper by these gentlemen, read to the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects.\r\n\r\nIt will of course be understood that many investigations of strength\r\nare instituted not necessarily out of fear that maximum strains\r\nmay not be adequately allowed for, but because the dual quality\r\nof strength-with-lightness may possibly be better attained by\r\nmodifications in the arrangements of material or sufficiently met by\r\nreduced scantling. The functions and influence of the Registration\r\nSocieties, already commented upon (see footnote, page 103), are such\r\nas to obviate the need for strength investigations generally, or\r\nat least are such as to discourage shipbuilders from independently\r\ninstituting them. Nevertheless, some well-known shipbuilders, who\r\nare also notable investigators, amongst whom may be named Inglis,\r\nMansel, Denny, and Wigham Richardson, have done much valuable work\r\nin this connection. Mr Denny, in particular, has vigorously devoted\r\nhimself to strength analysis on the basis of Lloyd’s methods of\r\nfixing scantling, and read several papers on the subject, in which\r\nstrong exception is taken to present practice. The healthy criticism\r\nwhich such labours have enabled those making them to offer regarding\r\nthe Registry systems of scantlings has not doubtless failed in\r\ninfluencing the legislation of the Registries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReverting to the subject of agencies for education in naval\r\narchitecture, a few remarks are due relative to Government\r\ninstitutions as having hitherto failed in being of immediate service\r\nto the mercantile marine. The training given to naval architects and\r\nmarine engineers at the Admiralty Schools is admirably adapted for\r\ncreating a staff of war-ship designers and expert mathematicians,\r\nsuch as are employed in the various departments of the Admiralty\r\nservice. The course of instruction has been framed expressly with\r\na view to this, and a very high standard of mathematical knowledge\r\nis necessary before students can enter upon it. The principle of\r\nrequiring one to become a first-class mathematician before attempting\r\nto teach him much of the science of naval architecture and its\r\napplication in practice, is of questionable merit: at any rate it\r\ncannot be carried out in the mercantile marine. Again; economy\r\nof time and of cost of production are conditions which largely\r\ngovern the methods followed in mercantile practice. Short methods\r\nof calculation, or of tentative approximation, for the purpose of\r\nenabling tenders to be made for proposed vessels, and of quickly\r\nproceeding with the work when secured, form no inconsiderable feature\r\nin the training required by mercantile naval architects. These,\r\nhowever, do not as a rule enter to any extent into Admiralty modes of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nThe want of satisfactory means for obtaining a sound scientific and\r\npractical training in mercantile naval architecture has for some time\r\nbeen felt to be very pressing. The evening classes conducted in most\r\nof the shipbuilding centres under the auspices of the Science and Art\r\nDepartment, South Kensington, are fitted to supply a part of this\r\nwant so far as elementary teaching is concerned. Until recently the\r\nantiquated character of the questions set for examination was subject\r\nof general complaint, both on the part of students and teachers.\r\nIn August, 1881, Mr William Denny read a paper on “Local Education\r\nin Naval Architecture” before the Institution of Naval Architects,\r\nin which adequate expression was given to these complaints, and\r\nat the same time proposed amendments offered. As a consequence of\r\nthis paper, and of the steps taken by the Institution in appointing\r\na deputation to wait upon the Government, the questions have been\r\nconsiderably improved, and are now so framed as to form a fairly\r\ncrucial test of a young student’s knowledge of the science and\r\npractice of modern shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nDuring the past three years efforts have been made by the Council\r\nof the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland[30]\r\nto supply more adequate means of advanced education. In 1880,\r\nthe Council had before them a project, promoted, for most part\r\nindependently, by Mr Robert Duncan and others, to establish a\r\nLectureship of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. It was\r\nproposed to collect funds sufficient to endow the lectureship under\r\nthe auspices of the University, and promises of substantial aid were\r\nobtained from several members. Mr J. G. Lawrie volunteered to give\r\nthe first course of lectures and did so, according to arrangement,\r\nduring the winter months of 1881-82 before a considerable number of\r\nstudents, the lectures being delivered in the University of Glasgow\r\nduring the day, and repeated in the Institution rooms in the evening.\r\nThese praiseworthy efforts were still being carried on when, in\r\nNovember, 1883, the gratifying announcement was made of a gift of\r\n£12,500 by Mrs John Elder, widow of the late eminent engineer, for\r\nthe endowment of a Chair of Naval Architecture in the University. The\r\nfounding of this chair, and the subsequent election by the University\r\nCourt of Mr Francis Elgar to the Professorship, have thus doubtless\r\nobviated the need for further efforts to found the lectureship, but\r\nthere are many commendable objects connected with the University\r\nChair to which the continued efforts of the gentlemen who supported\r\nthe lecture project might fittingly be directed. Many students who\r\ncan afford it will doubtless study the higher branches of naval\r\narchitecture at Glasgow University, and if a few small University\r\nscholarships were established, for which all classes of workers\r\nin the shipyards and drawing offices might compete, the highest\r\nprofessional training would then be within the reach of the poorest\r\nof lads.\r\n\r\nEvidences have recently been given of a strong desire on the part\r\nof many engaged in the shipbuilding and engineering industries of\r\nthe Tyne and Wear for the founding of a Chair of Naval Architecture\r\nin some educational institution in that district. Along with this\r\nmovement a desire has been shown for the establishment of an\r\nInstitution of Engineers and Shipbuilders such as has been so long\r\ncarried on successfully in the Clyde district. Definite steps are\r\nabout to be taken for the realisation of these important objects, and\r\ndoubtless no great time will elapse before they are accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of papers and lectures dealing with scientific problems in\r\nshipbuilding, to which readers desiring fuller acquaintance with the\r\n_technique_ and details of the subjects are referred:—\r\n\r\n  THE PROGRESS OF SHIPBUILDING IN ENGLAND: _Westminster Review_,\r\n  January, 1881.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE.

The past few years have been uncommonly fruitful of\r\nchanges in this direction, and many things point to the likelihood of\r\nmanual work being still more largely superseded by machine power in\r\nthe immediate future. Such changes, however, have not, as might be\r\nassumed, had any very sensible effect in diminishing the number of\r\noperatives generally employed. The influence has rather been absorbed\r\nin the greatly increased rate of production, and the elaboration and\r\nenhanced refinement of detail demanded by the much more exacting\r\nstandard of modern times. The need for skilled handicraftsmen may\r\nnot now be so general, but the skill which is still indispensable is\r\nof a higher character, and has called into existence several almost\r\nentirely new classes of shipyard operatives.\r\n\r\nThe extended employment of machinery has given impetus to, and\r\nreceived impetus from, the system of “piece-work” now so much in\r\nvogue in shipyards. In several of the operations, such as riveting\r\nand smithing, the nature of the work peculiarly lends itself to the\r\nsystem, and piece-work has consequently been in force, as regards\r\nthese operations, for many years. In several other departments,\r\nhowever, such as plate and bar fitting, joinery, and carpentry,\r\npiece-work is only contemporaneous with and largely the consequence\r\nof improved modern machinery. Reference to “piece-work” here is not\r\nmade with the intention of discussing its effects on the labour\r\nquestion—concerned as this is with such large issues—but simply\r\nof showing what effect the system has had on the character of\r\nshipyard workmanship. It was a favourite argument some years ago,\r\nwhen piece-work was being rapidly extended, that the system was bad\r\nbecause it would lead to and foster scamp-work and bad workmanship.\r\nThe results of the past dozen years’ experience disprove this\r\ncompletely, and for reasons which, as early as 1877, were pointed out\r\nby Mr William Denny—to whose spirited advocacy and adoption of the\r\nsystem its present degree of acceptance with workmen is in no small\r\nmeasure owing. In his admirably written pamphlet on “The Worth of\r\nWages,” published in the year named, Mr Denny says:—\r\n\r\n  “As to piece-work leading to bad workmanship, this would certainly\r\n  be the result were no special arrangements made to prevent it.\r\n  These special arrangements include a rigid system of inspecting\r\n  the work, and the rejection, at the workman’s cost, of all bad\r\n  and inferior work. There is no difficulty in carrying out such\r\n  a system, for foremen, freed from the necessity of watching the\r\n  quantity of the work—which is looked after by a special clerk—and\r\n  of checking the laziness of their men, can give their whole\r\n  attention to the matter of quality. In fact, piece-work compels\r\n  so thorough an inspection, that we find the work done under it in\r\n  our iron department much superior to what used to be done some\r\n  years ago on time. It is very curious that trades’ unionists never\r\n  have been very anxious as to the quality of their work till they\r\n  had piece-work to contend with, and I have never known workmen\r\n  produce such good work, as after a few experiences of having their\r\n  workmanship condemned for its bad quality, and the cost taken\r\n  out of their pockets. Under the old time wages no such effective\r\n  stimulus urged a man on to make his piece of work up to a proper\r\n  standard.”\r\n\r\nWhat was true of the system as exemplified in Messrs Denny’s\r\nexperience previous to 1877, holds equally good for all the yards in\r\nwhich piece-work is now the rule. Under it work is done quicker and\r\nbetter than by the old system, and so popular is it amongst workmen\r\nthat a deep-rooted dislike for “time-work” prevails where piece-work\r\nhas once been instituted and efficiently managed.\r\n\r\nThe machines in use at the present day for preparing the separate and\r\nmultitudinous pieces of material which go to form the hull structure\r\nof iron and steel vessels are both numerous and highly efficient.\r\nThis work of preparing material, it may be shortly stated, mainly\r\nconsists of shearing and planing the edges of plates and bars—these\r\nas supplied by the manufacturers being, of course, only approximately\r\nnear the final form and dimensions—rolling and flattening or giving\r\nuniform curvature to plates; bending angle or other bars, such as\r\nare used for deck beams; and punching the holes through plates and\r\nbars for the reception of rivets. In this list regard is not had\r\nto the operations concerned with material in the heated state, the\r\nfeatures requiring to be thus manipulated being mainly the frames of\r\nthe vessel; the work being effected without the aid of any special\r\nmachine tools. A small proportion of the plating also requires to\r\nbe operated upon in this state, and for this purpose machine tools\r\nare sometimes brought into requisition, some notice of which will be\r\ntaken further on.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the machines have been introduced for a period\r\nexceeding that with which our review is more directly concerned,\r\nimproved types have been made, and entirely new machines brought\r\ninto requisition during recent times. The universal adoption of\r\npiece-work in almost all the departments of construction has demanded\r\na more economical type of machine than formerly. In this way punching\r\nmachines, which play so important a part in shipyards, have risen\r\nfrom a working speed of about fourteen rivet holes per minute to\r\nthirty and even—in the case of frame punching—to as high as forty per\r\nminute. Other machines have had a corresponding increase in speed; in\r\nseveral of the best appointed yards the general increase being about\r\nsixty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the double bottom for water ballast in ships,\r\nbrought about a great increase in the amount of necessary punching\r\ncaused by the numerous man-holes required through the floors and\r\nlongitudinals. These man-holes, oval in shape as shown by Fig.\r\n1—of say 18-ins. by 12-ins.—had to be punched all round by the\r\nrivet-punch, and the edges afterwards dressed by hand with a chisel.\r\nTo economise work in this connection, need was felt for a machine\r\nwhich would be capable of punching a man-hole of the ordinary size\r\nout of the thickest plate at one operation. In 1879, at the request\r\nof one of the prominent Clyde firms, Messrs Craig & Donald, the\r\nwell-known machine-tool makers of Johnstone, introduced a man-hole\r\npunching machine which cut holes 18-ins. by 12-ins. at the rate of\r\nseven per minute, in such a way that no after-dressing with chisels\r\nwas required. This machine, an ordinary eccentric motion one driven\r\nby its own engine, although tested and found capable of cutting an\r\n18-in. by 12-in. hole through a plate 1-in. thick, was superseded\r\nin the yard for which it was made, by another, designed to meet the\r\nrequirements of the heaviest type of vessels built on the cellular\r\nprinciple. This machine—also made by Messrs Craig & Donald, and\r\nfive or six of which are now at work in yards on the Clyde and at\r\nBarrow—was capable of piercing a hole 30-ins. by 21-ins. through a\r\nplate ¾-ins. thick, at one operation, and was actuated by hydraulic\r\npower. The ordinary eccentric machine, driven by engine attached, is\r\nstill in favour for lighter work, and machines of this type are at\r\nwork in several of the East Coast yards capable of punching holes up\r\nto 21-ins. by 15-ins. through plates ¾-ins. thick.\r\n\r\nReverting to the subject of the proportion of material requiring to\r\nbe heated before manipulation, it is noteworthy that the employment\r\nof mild steel is a source of economy in this connection as well as\r\nin the many others already noticed. The superior homogeneity and\r\ngreat ductility of the material favours cold-bending when such an\r\noperation would be fatal to iron. Not only does an economy in labour\r\nresult, but incidentally there is a further advantage. Cold-bending\r\ndistresses steel less than hot-bending, and the special precautions\r\nso often taken, in the way of annealing, to toughen steel which has\r\nbeen operated upon when hot, are thus obviated.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of the bottom plates in a ship—_e.g._, those\r\nadjoining the keel—and a few at the stern and elsewhere, have quick\r\nbends and twists which are much more difficult to treat than the\r\neasy and generally uniform curvatures on the plates of the bilge.\r\nThe latter are effected in great measure by the “bending rolls”\r\nwith the plates perfectly cold, but the former have to be made with\r\nthe plate in the heated state. Hydraulic presses have been used\r\nfor this purpose for some years, a certain proportion of the work\r\ndone being the manipulation of plates while cold. With steel as the\r\nmaterial to be operated upon, these machines are being more and more\r\nutilised in this direction, and their presence in the shipyard, as\r\nin boiler works, is sure to become more and more prevalent. The\r\noperations of the shipyard, in short, have been gaining in exactitude\r\nevery year, and have borrowed both in the matters of methods and of\r\nappliances from the marine boiler works, where machine tools are more\r\nconspicuously a feature. Machine tools for riveting, now playing so\r\nimportant a part in shipyards, first had their utility approved in\r\nboiler shops, and the introduction of improved types of drilling\r\nmachines is largely the reflected successes attending them there.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing imperfect sketch of the principal directions in\r\nwhich machine tools used in _preparing material_ for the constructive\r\nstage have been improved or recently introduced, it will be gathered\r\nthat hydraulic power in lieu of steam has taken a prominent place in\r\nshipyards. That this is so to a remarkable extent will sufficiently\r\nappear from what follows regarding the appliances used in the work of\r\n_binding the structure_ of vessels. It may, however, be premised that\r\nin several establishments hydraulic pressure has now displaced steam\r\npower in almost all the machine-tools used in the iron departments.\r\nThis is so in the case of the Naval Dockyards of Toulon and Brest,\r\nin France, and of the Spanish naval establishments at Ferrol, Cadiz,\r\n&c.; the machinery in the former of which was fully described in\r\nJune, 1878, before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, by M.\r\nMarc Berrier-Fontaine, of the French Navy. The plant and machinery\r\nare by Mr Ralph H. Tweddell, C.E., of Delahay Street, London, whose\r\nnumerous inventions and great experience in this special branch of\r\nengineering are well worthy of recognition. The machines comprise\r\nthose for punching, shearing, angle cutting, plate bending, and\r\nriveting, and the author referred to is high in his praise of\r\nthe superior efficiency and economy of the hydraulic system, as\r\nexemplified in practice. One or two of the leading advantages of\r\nthe system may be here summarised. Hydraulic machines do not consume\r\nany power at all during the interval between employment, and the\r\npower can be applied at any moment without preparatory consumption,\r\nand stopped equally quick. No shafting or belting is required, and\r\nthe wear and tear of continuous motion, as in steam machines, is\r\nthus obviated. The power exerted is much more gradual than that of\r\nsteam, performing the work more thoroughly, and with less liability\r\nto strain or otherwise damage the material operated upon, or the tool\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough hydraulic machinery was successfully introduced by Sir\r\nWilliam Armstrong so long ago as 1836, and has since been applied\r\nby him and others in almost every direction the application of\r\nhydraulic power to machines for constructive purposes is of\r\ncomparatively modern date. Its early employment as the motive power\r\nfor machine-tools was in the case of machines which were “stationary”\r\nor “fixed” in position when in use. Machines for riveting purposes\r\nin boiler shops and locomotive works were the first tools of any\r\nnote to which hydraulic power transmitted from a distance was\r\napplied, but even this dates back only to about 1865. In that year\r\nMr R. H. Tweddell, already referred to, designed hydraulic plant,\r\nconsisting of pumps, an accumulator, and a riveting machine, which\r\nwere first used by Messrs Thompson, Boyd & Co., Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nwith satisfactory results. The work was done perfectly, and at about\r\none-seventh of the cost of hand work, and the same power was utilized\r\nin actuating hydraulic presses for such purposes as setting or\r\n“joggling” angle or tee irons. Excellence and economy of work were\r\nthus secured; and in a comparatively short time above 100 machines\r\nwere at work in various dockyards and large works.\r\n\r\nAlthough patent designs for portable hydraulic riveters existed\r\nbefore 1871, it was not till that year that any form of portable\r\nriveters was applied in practice with any degree of success. Previous\r\nto that year the frames of ships had been riveted by Mr Tweddell’s\r\nstationary hydraulic machines, but a portable riveter invented\r\nby that gentleman in 1871 was then tried, when it was thoroughly\r\ndemonstrated that during a working day of 10 hours the machine was\r\ncapable of closing 1,000 rivets. Not much encouragement, however,\r\nwas received from shipbuilders at the time, owing chiefly to the\r\nfact that the wages for riveting labour was not then a very urgent\r\nquestion. On a modification of the general plan of working, these\r\nmachines being proposed by their inventor in 1876, they received\r\nmore cordial recognition from shipbuilders thereafter. It is only,\r\nhowever, within the past five years or so that portable riveters have\r\nbeen so extensively introduced into shipbuilding yards. The success\r\nwhich has attended them during the period leaves no reasonable doubt\r\nas to their ultimate place in every well-appointed shipbuilding\r\nestablishment. Already the majority of Clyde shipyards—including all\r\nthe larger ones—and most of the yards in the Tyne and Wear districts,\r\nare furnished with hydraulic riveting machines and plant, overtaking\r\nwork constantly, efficiently, and with greatly reduced expense, that\r\nis matter of envy in yards not similarly favoured. In most of the\r\nlarger Clyde yards the Tweddell machinery and plant are employed; but\r\nin some cases machines introduced by Mr William Arrol, Dalmarnock\r\nIronworks, Glasgow—chiefly for riveting the frames, beams, &c.—are\r\nused. The Arrol machines work on a similar principle to those of Mr\r\nTweddell, whose system is practically the only one in use on the Tyne\r\nand the Wear, and at Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe prime cost of furnishing a complete hydraulic plant is of course\r\nconsiderable, and such as might perhaps appear an outlay not speedily\r\nenough recouped. In view, however, of the uncertain and oftentimes\r\nharassing conditions—not to speak of the pecuniary loss—under\r\nwhich the riveting department of shipbuilding work is conducted in\r\nthe ordinary way, shipbuilders are constrained to acknowledge the\r\neconomic advantages of the hydraulic system. Neither expense nor\r\ntrouble have been spared in several yards to extend the hydraulic\r\nsystem into every feature where hydraulic work is practicable. The\r\nonly feature now for which the machines presently in use are not\r\navailable is the shell plating, and perhaps the decks, where such\r\nare entirely laid with plates. Indeed, it may fairly be said that\r\nhydraulic riveters have virtually supplanted manual riveting in\r\nnine-tenths of the structural features of a vessel. The percentage of\r\nrivets closed by machinery to the total number of rivets employed in\r\na vessel’s structure has been computed to be about fifty per cent.\r\nIn one of the yards fitted with the Tweddell system the following\r\ncomprise the list of structural features for which the hydraulic\r\nriveters are daily employed:—Double bottom, including the thousands\r\nof detached pieces of plates and angles of which the bracket floor\r\nstyle of bottom is composed; side bars attaching frames to double\r\nbottom, frames and reverse frames, beams, stiffening bars, gunwale\r\nbars, keelsons, and keels.\r\n\r\nThe shell plating, as has already been said, is about the only\r\nfeature for which inventors and manufacturers of hydraulic riveters\r\nhave now any serious difficulty in making provision. But many minds\r\nare exercised with the problem, and doubtless at no very distant\r\ndate the present obstacles will be surmounted. One aspect of the\r\nquestion—and one which certain classes are apt to overlook—is that\r\nwhich regards the _mutual_ adaptation of means to the end desired.\r\nShipbuilders have often under consideration the practicability of so\r\nmodifying structural features and methods of work as that inventors\r\nof mechanical riveters will be met half-way in supplying the\r\nmuch-felt desideratum. Referring to this subject, Mr Henry H. West,\r\nchief surveyor to the Underwriters Registry for Iron Vessels, in a\r\npaper on “Riveting of Iron Ships,” read before the Institution of\r\nNaval Architects at its last meeting, said:—\r\n\r\n  “May I urge upon shipbuilders the importance of endeavouring to\r\n  extend the application of power riveting to the shell plating of\r\n  iron vessels. By this means we shall both increase the frictional\r\n  resistance, and also, by more completely filling the rivet\r\n  holes, vastly improve the rigidity of the riveted joints. The\r\n  difficulty of completely and exactly filling the counter-sink of\r\n  a counter-sunk hole with a machine-closed rivet suggested to my\r\n  friend Mr Kirk the idea of entering the rivet from the outside,\r\n  both the rivet and the counter-sink being made to gauge, and then\r\n  closing up with a machine snap-point on the inside of the ship.\r\n  What progress he has made in this direction I do not know, but the\r\n  difficulty does not appear to be an insuperable one. If however,\r\n  we are prepared to sacrifice a fair appearance to utilitarian\r\n  simplicity, there seems no sufficient reason why, above water, all\r\n  the rivets should not be closed up with snap heads and points,\r\n  both inside and outside. In whatever way it is accomplished, I\r\n  look to the use of machine riveting as one very great step in\r\n  advance in the future improvement of the riveted joints of iron\r\n  ships; and if the weight of iron vessels is to be reduced in any\r\n  important degree, or if the dimensions and proportions of large\r\n  merchant steamers are to increase in the future as they have done\r\n  in the past, I feel sure that one of the first steps must be the\r\n  reconsideration of our butt fastenings.”\r\n\r\nThe increased engine power now demanded in steamships undoubtedly\r\npoints to the further adoption of mechanical riveting—if vessels\r\nare to successfully withstand the enormous strain and vibrations to\r\nwhich they are thereby subject. While several have already shown\r\ndrawings of the shell difficulty having been met, Mr Tweddell, whose\r\nexperience in common with that of his manufacturers and co-patentees,\r\nMessrs Fielding & Platt, of Gloucester, may justly be considered\r\ngreatest in this branch of engineering, has never illustrated this.\r\nIt may be mentioned, however, that excellent flush riveting is\r\nconstantly done by the Tweddell hydraulic riveters, and that the\r\nsame plan suggested by Mr Kirk of entering rivets with prepared\r\ncounter-sunk heads from one side, and snap pointing them by machine\r\non the other has been long in use by Messrs Fielding & Platt. In\r\nconjunction with Mr Tweddell, this firm have also designed several\r\nefficient arrangements to ensure the machine being kept in position\r\nuntil the unfinished head of the rivet is formed. Judging from\r\nthese facts, there seems good reason to hope that the production of\r\nriveting machines required to overtake the remaining features will\r\nnot be very long delayed.\r\n\r\nTo show that where the exigencies of the times necessitate them,\r\nexpedients involving inventive skill and industrial intrepidity are\r\nnever quite wanting, it may be related that several years ago, during\r\na prolonged strike of riveters, the principal of the firm of Messrs\r\nA. M‘Millan & Son, Dumbarton, introduced a portable riveting machine\r\nfor the shells of ships. The machine, although improvised, as it\r\nwere, to meet an emergency, fulfilled all that was expected of it,\r\nand won the approval of Lloyd’s Surveyors for the Clyde district, as\r\nwell as of a special deputation selected by the Committee of Lloyd’s\r\nin London from among the chief surveyors of the United Kingdom. Their\r\nverdict on the performances of the machine after due inspection was\r\nthat it “thoroughly fills the holes and countersinks, and produces\r\na smoother and better clench than can usually be obtained by hand\r\nlabour.” From this it will be seen that in the yard of Messrs\r\nM‘Millan the matter of machine riveting has received early and\r\nearnest consideration. Indeed, the extent to which hydraulic riveting\r\nis presently employed by this firm so well represents the development\r\nand progress made in this direction throughout other yards that the\r\nsystem adopted in their establishment may be described somewhat in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic plant and numerous different classes of portable\r\nriveters are on the Tweddell system. The hydraulic power required to\r\nwork the various machines is furnished by a pair of vertical steam\r\nengines, geared to a set of two-throw pumps, which force the water\r\nat a pressure of 1,500-lb. per square inch into an accumulator. This\r\nlatter feature, as is well known, serves to store up the power in a\r\nconsiderable amount ready to meet the sudden demands of one or more\r\nof the riveters without calling on the pumps. As is the case in all\r\nmachinery on this system, the accumulator is loaded to a pressure of\r\n1,500-lb. per square inch. The means employed for the transmission\r\nof the water-power, from the service of main pipes laid as required\r\nthroughout the yard, are flexible copper pipes, admitting of being\r\nled almost in any direction, however irregular, without being\r\nimpaired or rendered inefficient. When the plant was laid down about\r\nfour years ago, Messrs M‘Millan determined to err if anything on\r\nthe side of prudence, and they laid all their mains of double the\r\nrequired size, so that they could, if the high pressure was found\r\nobjectionable, return to the lower pressures sometimes employed; they\r\nhave, however, never found it advisable to do so.\r\n\r\nIn this yard can be seen portable riveters suspended over a vessel’s\r\ndeck between 40 and 50 feet above ground, capable of reaching and\r\nclenching rivets in stringers at a distance of 4 feet 6 inches from\r\nedge of plate. The power brought into play in closing some of these\r\nrivets is very great—from 20 to 30 tons—and yet this is conveyed by a\r\nsmall tube of only half-inch outside diameter in some cases through\r\na distance of many hundred feet. The portable riveter here indicated\r\nis suspended on a light and handy carriage, which can travel the\r\nupper deck from stem to stern, being made purposely low so as to\r\nclear poop and bridge deck beams if such should be fitted. With\r\nthis machine Messrs M‘Millan have closed from 400 to 450 rivets per\r\nday of nine hours in stringers 3 feet 6 inches wide. They have also\r\neffected some very heavy work in attaching the sheer strake to the\r\ngunwale bar, the rate of progress being correspondingly satisfactory.\r\nThe same features in the _Alaska_, built by Messrs John Elder & Co.,\r\nwere similarly operated upon by another of Mr Tweddell’s riveters,\r\nwhose complete system has been adopted in this large establishment\r\nalso. By an elongation of the suspending arm Messrs M‘Millan hope to\r\nexecute, besides the stringers, most of the deck work, such as ties,\r\ndiagonals, hatch coamings, &c., in one traverse of the carriage.\r\nMoreover, a second carriage with riveter may be doing simultaneously\r\nthe same work on the other side of the vessel. Indeed, it only\r\nrequires a further development of such work to make the riveting of\r\ncomplete iron decks practicable, and—with the rate of wages, for hand\r\nriveted work, usually prevailing—profitable also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nTWEDDELL PORTABLE FRAME AND BEAM RIVETER.]\r\n\r\nThe riveting of the frames and beams is the simplest of all the work\r\novertaken by the hydraulic riveters, and it is here the system is\r\nseen to most advantage. In any yard furnished with these machines\r\nrivets are closed at a greatly accelerated rate compared with work\r\ndone by hand. Tweddell machines have been known to close, in beams,\r\n1,800 to 1,900 rivets per machine per day of 9½ hours. In frames the\r\naverage rate at which rivets are closed is about 1,400 per day. The\r\ncost for this section of riveted work has been computed to be about\r\none-half of that by hand, and the quality of the work is everywhere\r\nacknowledged to be better. With the same number of men the work is\r\naccomplished in something like one-third of the time. The _modus\r\noperandi_ in overtaking this feature of the work may be briefly\r\ndescribed. For the riveting of the frames, in almost every case, two\r\ncranes of any convenient construction are fixed at the head of the\r\nberth in which the vessel is to be built; the frames are laid across\r\nthe keel as in hand work, and rest on trestles, where the portable\r\nriveter, carried on the before-mentioned cranes, rivets them up. As\r\nthe riveting in each frame is completed it is drawn down the keel\r\nby steam or hand power, and set up in place. The riveting of the\r\nbeams is a still more simple operation, the beam to be riveted being\r\nplaced under a gantry somewhat longer than the beam itself, and upon\r\nwhich the portable riveter travels. The suspending gear in this and\r\nother of the Tweddell machines combines the functions of hydraulic\r\nlifts for raising or lowering the riveter, and of conveying the\r\nnecessary hydraulic pressure to the riveter. The beam is supported on\r\ntrestles, and the riveter, having the facilities for travel and exact\r\nadjustment just described, accomplishes the surprising work before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the riveting in cellular and bracket\r\nbottoms is accomplished are less favourable to expeditious work. This\r\nsystem of ship’s bottom is greatly more complex in its constructive\r\nfeatures than the ordinary bottom. The separate plates and angles\r\nwhich go to form the bracket floor system are to be numbered—in\r\nvessels of the average size—by thousands. The frames in such vessels\r\nare formed of three parts; one part stretches across the bottom and\r\nabuts against the plates forming the sides of the cellular bottom;\r\nthe other two parts form the sides of the vessel, but are not erected\r\nuntil the bottom portions of the frames have been laid and all the\r\nbracket and longitudinal girders are erected and fitted upon them. On\r\nthe bottom, as thus described, the portable riveters are required to\r\noperate, in many instances having to reach the rivets at a distance\r\nof 4 feet 6 inches from the edge of the plates, and in confined\r\nspaces of 24 inches. When the frames and beams are completely riveted\r\nand beginning to be erected, a travelling-crane (in Messrs M‘Millan’s\r\ntwo travelling cranes are employed working from separate ends of the\r\nvessel) carrying a large portable riveter, is placed on the top of\r\nthe floors, with short lengths of planking laid to act as tramways.\r\nThe perfect control thus obtained is somewhat extraordinary. The\r\ncrane jib has sufficient rake to command the whole floor of the\r\nship, and every rivet can be closed in the confined spaces already\r\ndescribed. Some 800 rivets per day can be put in, many of them at a\r\ndistance of 4 feet 6 ins. from the edge of the plate. The quality of\r\nthe work is all that could be desired; in some parts, indeed, the\r\nuse of the felt-packing necessary in hand work has been found to be\r\nunnecessary owing to the tight work obtained by hydraulic riveting.\r\nOne crane with its riveting machine can, in a vessel of moderate\r\nsize, say 3,000 to 4,000 tons, fully keep pace with the up-ending\r\nof the frames, provided it has something of a start. As it advances\r\nthe lower deck beams are put in place behind it, and the other\r\nwork follows in order. In ships of the more ordinary construction,\r\nlongitudinal keelsons are fitted, which are readily reached by\r\nspecial portable riveters, suspended by means of neat devices, some\r\nof them the ideas or suggestions of workmen in Messrs M‘Millan’s\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe only machine of the series of portable riveters employed by\r\nMessrs M‘Millan which remains to be noticed is that which overtakes\r\nthe riveting of keels. This machine is perhaps one of the most\r\nperfect of the series, performing its functions satisfactorily,\r\nviewed from whatever standpoint. The riveting required on the keel of\r\nlarge vessels is very heavy, especially if the through-keelson and\r\nside-bar system is adopted, when five thicknesses of plate have to be\r\nconnected, the rivets employed being 1⅛-inch or 1¼-inch in diameter.\r\nThe situation is not favourable for getting at the work to be done,\r\nthe head-room available not often exceeding 2½ or 3 feet. These\r\nconditions render great compactness, together with portableness,\r\nnecessary in the machine. The keel itself was utilised for the\r\nattachment of the Tweddell riveter as first tried, then again a sort\r\nof light trestle was employed, the riveter being at one end of a\r\nlever racking on this. These plans were abandoned, however, in favour\r\nof the machine as now used in various yards throughout the country,\r\nan illustration of which is given by Fig. 23. A low carriage is\r\ntravelled down alongside the keel. This carriage supports a balanced\r\nlever, carrying at one end the riveter, capable of exerting about 50\r\ntons on the rivet head, and at the other a balance weight. This lever\r\ncan in its turn revolve horizontally about a short pillar fixed on a\r\nturn-table, thus affording unlimited control over the riveter by the\r\nman in charge; enabling him, indeed, to adjust the riveter to every\r\nirregularity of position or direction of the rivets in keel. As many\r\nas 420 1¼-inch rivets per day have been put in by this machine, an\r\namount which is fully equal to the work of two squads of riveters,\r\nand in one yard 70 rivets have been closed in as many consecutive\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nTWEDDELL HYDRAULIC KEEL RIVETER.]\r\n\r\nIt may be stated generally that the several hydraulic riveters\r\nrequire two men to work them, and the rivets are heated in portable\r\nfurnaces and dealt out in any quantities required, by a boy in\r\nattendance. The quality of the work done is superior to hand\r\nwork, chiefly in that when rivets are well heated the pressure is\r\nequalised, and affects the rivets throughout their entire length,\r\nfilling the holes to their utmost. This advantage tells more in the\r\ncase of keel riveting, and that it is so is evidenced by the fact, as\r\ncommunicated by a foreman having great experience, that rivets ¼-inch\r\nlonger than rivets closed by hand have even less superfluous surface\r\nmaterial when closed by the machine.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts above detailed, taken in conjunction with the opinions\r\nof such authorities as Mr West, it can fairly be claimed for Mr\r\nTweddell as the inventor of the earliest of the hydraulic riveters\r\nnow so extensively employed in shipyards, that he has greatly\r\nimproved the character of work in ship construction. Not only so, but\r\nhe has relieved the shipyard artizan from a species of work which\r\nrequires little or no skill in its execution—work, indeed, which may\r\nproperly be relegated to, as it certainly in course of time will be\r\nincluded in, that vast domain in which water, steam, electricity, and\r\nthe other natural powers are so wondrously made to play their part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the extended use of improved machinery has brought about\r\nchanges in the iron-working departments of shipyards that are\r\nstructurally of the greatest importance, it is nevertheless true that\r\nthe largest acquisition to shipyard machinery of late has been made\r\nin the wood-working departments. It is here, beyond question, where\r\nthe equipment of modern shipyards is seen to be so much an advance\r\non the former order of things, when handicraft was indispensable\r\nand paramount; and it is also here, probably, where the greatest\r\nlabour-saving advances have been made. The artistic perfection which\r\nis evinced in the palatial saloons and state-rooms of many modern\r\nsteamships would not have been possible—commercially so, at least—to\r\nthe shipbuilders of twenty years ago, whose appliances, regarded\r\nfrom present-day standpoints, seem to have been woefully crude and\r\nmeagre. Still, it is not by any means to be understood that all the\r\nshipyards of to-day are alike commentaries on the former state of\r\nthings, because even now there are not wanting yards in which the\r\nnecessary wood-work for ships is accomplished with singularly few\r\nmachines. The need for accessions in this direction, however, is\r\nbeing more keenly felt every day, and in many yards quite recently\r\nthe entire joinery department has been thoroughly re-organised and\r\nequipped. The chapter which follows will be devoted to descriptions\r\nof some representative establishments in the several districts, and\r\nas special references may therein be made to the machinery equipment\r\nof the wood-working departments, the present remarks will only be of\r\na general nature.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of wood from the absolutely rough state into finished\r\nand finely-surfaced material, ready for immediate use in the interior\r\nof vessels, forms at the present time not an uncommon portion of\r\nthe daily work in shipyards well equipped with modern machinery.\r\nThis is not only concerned with the commoner woods employed in large\r\nquantities for structural purposes, but also to a considerable\r\nextent with those various ornamental hardwoods entering into the\r\ndecorative features. The change of which this is indicative is one\r\nof increased self-dependence and economy formerly not dreamed of\r\nin shipyards, and of improvements at every stage in the machinery\r\nfor wood conversion, which are simply wonderful. In circular and\r\nstraight saws, planing, moulding, and shaping machines, band and\r\nfret-saw machines, mortising, tenoning, and dove-tailing machines,\r\nand in machines for scraping, sand-papering, and miscellaneous\r\npurposes, not a few modern shipyards reflect the fullest engineering\r\nprogress as concerned with wood-working machinery. In planing\r\nmachines especially are the labour-saving advantages made apparent.\r\nAs illustrating this it may be explained that machines of this\r\nkind in daily use are able to plane a greatly increased breadth of\r\nsurface, to work several sides of the wood at one operation, and\r\nat a marvellously accelerated speed as compared with hand work.\r\nSimilarly, as regards the formation of mouldings, it may be stated\r\nthat a moulding which would take a competent workman some hours to\r\nproduce can be completed on a good machine in less than _one minute_.\r\nMany patterns of mouldings and other decorative items now largely\r\nused are thus only possible—commercially if not otherwise—through the\r\nextended employment of machinery. The degree of “finish” now put\r\nupon the plainest features—rendered pecuniarly possible by the use\r\nof machinery—is nowhere so striking as in the scraping of panels and\r\nthe sand-papering of large surfaces. In one shipyard the author has\r\nwitnessed the scraping of hardwood panels as broad as 30-ins., the\r\nshaving taken off being of marvellous thinness and perfectly uniform\r\nand entire throughout the length and breadth of panel. The surface\r\nleft on the panel is beautifully smooth, rendering any after-dressing\r\nwith sand paper superfluous, and the shavings have all the appearance\r\nand much of the flexibility of fine paper. In many other ways\r\nthat might be instanced, the improvement in machinery is not less\r\nstriking, but what has already been given may sufficiently illustrate\r\nthe general advance.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which modern wood-working machinery is obtained are\r\nvarious. Notable firms of machinists throughout this country, in\r\nAmerica, and on the Continent, are drawn upon, each of whom, although\r\nnot furnishing complete installations of wood-working machinery, are\r\ndistinguished for some “special make” of one or other of the machines\r\nnecessary. In the plentitude of firms whose names suggest themselves\r\nin this connection, it may be invidious to single out any for special\r\nmention, yet, of firms in this country, Messrs M‘Dowall & Sons, of\r\nJohnstone, and Messrs T. Robinson & Son, Rochdale; and of firms in\r\nAmerica, Messrs J. A. Fay & Co., of Cincinnati, may be noticed as\r\nhaving furnished many machines which are highly valued in shipyards.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the recent advancement in this direction, there is\r\nstill scope for improved wood-working machinery, and for machines to\r\novertake additional work in shipyards. A single, though perhaps not\r\nparticularly striking, instance may be given. While attempts have\r\nbeen made to supply it, there is not yet, so far as the author knows,\r\na machine for planing decks after the planking has been laid, and\r\nthe seams caulked and payed. Those acquaint with the laborious and\r\nunskilled nature of the work to be done, will readily concede the\r\nfitness of applying, if possible, mechanical means to achieve it.\r\n\r\nAttention may here be directed to the subject of improvements in\r\nshipyard machines and methods of work, directly due to the careful\r\nstudy of results from every-day practice. Workmen themselves have too\r\nseldom been instrumental in effecting such improvements, although in\r\nmany respects the most fitting mediums through which improvements\r\ncould come. A lingering antipathy to new machinery on the score of\r\nits supplanting hand work, and perhaps the want of proper knowledge\r\nof scientific principles, have prevented many from taking part\r\nin this way. To encourage the exercise of the inventive faculty\r\namongst workmen, as well as to reap personal advantage, Messrs Denny\r\n& Brothers instituted in 1880 a scheme of rewards for invention\r\nin their establishment, which has been attended with gratifying\r\nsuccess, and has since been copied in other quarters. Particulars\r\nof this scheme will be given in the following chapter, thus making\r\ndetailed reference here unnecessary. It may be said briefly, however,\r\nthat awards ranging from £12 to £3 are paid to workmen who submit\r\ninventions, and when any one has been successful in obtaining five\r\nawards he receives a premium of £20, and when he has obtained ten\r\nawards he is paid a further premium of £25—the premiums increasing\r\nby £5 for every additional five awards received. During the time it\r\nhas been in vogue as many as 200 claims have been entered, over 110\r\nof which have received awards, representing in all the disbursement\r\nby the firm of about £500. The majority of the awards made have been\r\nconcerned with improvements in the joinery departments. Some of the\r\nmachines there have been modified or altered so as to do twice the\r\nquantity of work previously possible, some to do a new class of work,\r\nand others to do the same work with greater safety, and with less\r\nwear and tear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn several other sections of shipyard work, progress is strikingly\r\nevinced. Of these it may suffice to instance the work of transport\r\nbetween one shop and another, and between workshops and building\r\nberths, also that of lifting heavy weights either by stationery or\r\nlocomotive cranes. Means of effecting such work are now employed in\r\nmany yards, which, viewed in the light of former things, are truly\r\nprodigious.\r\n\r\nThe increasing propulsive power with which steamships are being\r\nfitted necessitates ponderous weights in connection with the engines\r\nand boilers. The means available for lifting such weights have not\r\nuntil within recent years been possessed by private shipbuilders,\r\nbut have been the property of public bodies, such as Harbour Trusts.\r\nThe majority of shipbuilders have still to depend on such outside\r\naid, but within the past few years several large firms—particularly\r\non the Clyde—who have the necessary dock accommodation, have erected\r\nin connection with their works enormous “sheer-legs;” the modern\r\nequivalent for cranes, which are now somewhat out of fashion for\r\nponderous work. Some of these are amongst the most powerful ever\r\nerected, being capable of lifting 80, 100, and even 120 tons weight.\r\nSuch enormous appliances, it may readily be understood, enables the\r\nfirm possessing them to be independent of extraneous assistance, and\r\nto complete in every respect within their own establishments vessels\r\nof the largest class.\r\n\r\nThe means of transporting material in shipyards by systems of\r\nrailways laid alongside the principal workshops, and traversing the\r\nyard in all directions, have been amplified and improved in many\r\nyards within recent times. Connection is made in most instances with\r\nsidings from main lines of railway, whereby materials and goods can\r\nbe at once brought into the yards from whatever part of the kingdom;\r\nand in the largest yards special locomotives are constantly employed\r\ndoing this work. In well arranged establishments the railway first\r\nenters a store-yard, and the material is lifted from the trucks by\r\ntravelling-crane or other means, and deposited on either side of the\r\nrailway, plates being set on edge in special racks, from which they\r\ncan be easily removed by the workmen. Leaving this, the lines of\r\nrailway traverse the building yard throughout, and are designed to\r\npermit of the material being conveyed without retrocession, but with\r\nthe necessary stoppages for its being put through the various courses\r\nof manipulation, to the vessel in which it is to be used. A recent\r\nand very serviceable amplification of the system of railway transport\r\nhas been fitted in one of the largest Clyde yards which enables\r\nmaterial to be conveyed with greatly increased ease and despatch in\r\ndirections and to situations wholly inaccessible to the main lines\r\nof rails. This is the narrow gauge portable system, patented by M.\r\nDecauville, of Petit-Bourg, Paris, which consists of short lengths of\r\nvery light steel rails, permanently riveted to cross sleepers, and\r\nwith end connections so formed as to make joint while being pressed\r\ninto contact. Each section, of 4, 6, 8, 12, or 16 feet long, being\r\ncomplete in itself, the tramway can be laid down in any new situation\r\nvery rapidly. Where divergences of route take place, curves,\r\ncrossings, and light turntables are supplied, sufficiently strong\r\nto carry working loads, and at the same time light enough to be\r\neasily handled. Special waggons and trollies are also supplied by the\r\nmakers, which, combined with the system of portable rails described,\r\nnot only worthily take the place of, but far excel in handiness and\r\nefficiency, the ordinary wheel-barrows of the shipyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Papers, &c., bearing on modern shipyard machine-tools,\r\nappliances, and methods of work, to which readers desiring fuller\r\nacquaintance with the _technique_ and details of the subject are\r\nreferred:—\r\n\r\n  ON THE HYDRAULIC DEPARTMENT IN THE IRON SHIPBUILDING DEPARTMENT\r\n  OF THE NAVAL DOCKYARD AT TOULON, by M.

This want cannot better be supplied than\r\nby giving detailed descriptions of some representative shipyards\r\nand engineering works throughout the principal centres. The\r\nestablishments which will be selected for notice are amongst the\r\nlargest in the several districts, and on the whole represent almost\r\nall that is advanced in the shipbuilding industry, while to most of\r\nthem a special interest attaches through the many high-class vessels\r\nproduced from their stocks for the better-known shipping lines. On\r\nsuch grounds it is hoped the intelligent reader will find the choice\r\nof yards—where there was no alternative but to choose—justified and\r\nfitting. Three Clyde shipyards, two on the Tyne, one on the Wear, and\r\none at Barrow-in-Furness, will be described. The accounts are written\r\nfrom authoritative information specially supplied, aided and verified\r\nby personal knowledge of the works dealt with, and are chiefly\r\nconcerned with the capability and arrangement of the several yards.\r\nOther matters of a more technical nature, such as the comparison of\r\nmethods of work in the several districts,[31] are not dealt with.\r\nTo some extent this still differs in individual yards, but modern\r\npractice is being more assimilated throughout the districts as time\r\ngoes on. The first establishment dealt with will be:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSRS JOHN ELDER & CO.’S\r\n  SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING WORKS,\r\n  FAIRFIELD, GOVAN, NEAR GLASGOW.\r\n\r\n  The progress of shipbuilding and marine engineering on the Clyde\r\n  may be said to include several more or less well-defined periods\r\n  or stages, and the student of industrial progress must feel\r\n  bound to connect with these the name of the late John Elder, a\r\n  distinguished leader in these important industries, and an engineer\r\n  whose improvements in the marine engine deserve to rank alongside\r\n  those improvements which James Watt effected in his day. In 1852 Mr\r\n  Elder joined his friend, Mr Randolph, in an established business,\r\n  and shortly afterwards made preparations to add marine engineering\r\n  to the mill-wright and other businesses of the firm. The new firm\r\n  speedily established itself through a series of improvements,\r\n  having for their object the reduction of fuel consumption on board\r\n  steam vessels. In 1860 the firm commenced to build ships, and as\r\n  shipbuilders and marine engineers they laboured successfully for\r\n  sixteen years, building during that period 106 vessels, with an\r\n  aggregate tonnage of 81,326 tons, and constructing 111 sets of\r\n  marine engines, showing a nominal power of 20,145 horses. At this\r\n  time the co-partnery contract expired, and Mr John Elder took\r\n  over the entire works, carrying them on with great success until\r\n  his death, which occurred in London in September, 1869, when at\r\n  the early age of 45 years. After his death the business of the\r\n  firm was taken up by Mr John F. Ure, Mr J. L. K. Jamieson, and Mr\r\n  William Pearce, all of whom had previously achieved distinction in\r\n  shipbuilding and engineering, and the efforts of these gentlemen\r\n  far exceeded the success of Mr John Elder’s first firm. In 16\r\n  years, as above stated, the latter launched 106 vessels of an\r\n  aggregate tonnage of 81,326 tons, and constructed 111 sets of\r\n  marine engines of 20,145 nominal horse-power, whereas the new\r\n  firm launched in nine years 97 vessels of an aggregate tonnage\r\n  of 192,355 tons, and constructed 90 sets of marine engines of\r\n  31,193 nominal horse-power. About six years ago Mr Ure and Mr\r\n  Jamieson retired from the firm, leaving Mr Pearce sole partner,\r\n  and during these six years the activity and enterprise formerly\r\n  characterising the firm have been worthily sustained, and the firm\r\n  has kept in the very front rank. In maintaining this position, and\r\n  achieving unprecedented results in the matter of swift steamships,\r\n  not a little credit is due to Mr A. D. Bryce-Douglas, an engineer\r\n  of well-attested skill, who wields the sceptre of authority in the\r\n  engineering section.\r\n\r\n  The works, which are situated on the south bank of the Clyde at\r\n  Fairfield, near Govan, occupy an area of about 70 acres, and\r\n  comprise shipyard, boiler shop, engine works, and tidal basin.\r\n  The disposition of the various workshops is admirable, and as\r\n  these are connected with each other by a broad gauge line of\r\n  rails communicating with all parts of the yard and the terminus\r\n  of the Govan railway, the conveyance of raw material in the first\r\n  instance, its location in whatever section of the works it may\r\n  be specially designed for, and its transmission in the form of\r\n  finished items of structure or outfit to the vessels of which it is\r\n  to form part, are all accomplished with ease.\r\n\r\n  Entering by the south-east gate, the visitor proceeds in the\r\n  direction of the business offices, his first impression probably\r\n  being one of wonder at the immense quantities of iron and steel in\r\n  plates and bars covering every available piece of ground, as well\r\n  as the great quantity of timber of all dimensions stacked and in\r\n  racks, maturing for after use. Arriving at the offices of the firm,\r\n  the visitor is probably first ushered into the draughtsmen’s rooms,\r\n  which, as well as a large reception-room, contain an extensive\r\n  collection of models of the vessels that have been constructed by\r\n  the firm. In these apartments a large staff of draughtsmen are\r\n  employed in the work of designing new vessels, and making working\r\n  drawings of ships already contracted for.\r\n\r\n  Following the routine of practical operations the visitor is\r\n  conducted to the moulding loft, which is 320 feet long by 50 feet\r\n  wide. Here the drawings of the vessels are put down full size.\r\n  The term “laying off” is applied to the operation of transferring\r\n  to the mould loft-floor those designs and general proportions of\r\n  a ship which have been drawn on paper, and from which all the\r\n  preliminary calculations have been made and the form decided. The\r\n  lines of the ship and exact representations of many of the parts\r\n  of which it is composed are delineated here to their actual or\r\n  real dimensions, in order that moulds or skeleton outlines may be\r\n  made from them for the guidance of the workmen. These lines, when\r\n  completed and carefully verified, are afterwards transferred to\r\n  scrieve boards, from which the frames, floors, &c., are bent. In\r\n  connection with the moulding loft is a pattern shop, in which the\r\n  various moulds required in “laying off” are made.\r\n\r\n  Descending to the iron-work machine shop, which measures about\r\n  1000 feet long by 150 feet wide, a scene of great activity meets\r\n  the eye. Proceeding to that section where the bending blocks are\r\n  situated, the operation of forming the frames of a vessel may\r\n  be noticed. The bending blocks are massive iron plates weighing\r\n  several tons, on which the form of the frame is marked from the\r\n  scrieve boards. All over the blocks are round holes, closely spaced\r\n  and equidistant, in which iron pins are placed to give the form of\r\n  the frame to be bent. Long bars of angle-iron, properly heated in\r\n  adjacent furnaces, are brought by the workmen to the blocks, and\r\n  there the bars are bent round the pins to the form required. The\r\n  half frame of a ship is thus fashioned to the proper form in little\r\n  more time than it takes to describe the process. It is now allowed\r\n  to cool, and it is then returned to the scrieve boards to be set\r\n  or adjusted with the reverse frame, which with the floor plate go\r\n  to make the frame in its finished form. While this is going on,\r\n  the keel blocks are being laid in the usual manner on the building\r\n  slip, and the keel, stem, and stern-posts are being forged and\r\n  drilled. The keel is laid, and the frames are then set up in their\r\n  places, and are kept in position by shores and ribbon pieces. The\r\n  stem and stern-posts are then set up, and the work now becomes\r\n  general all over the vessel. The beams previously made are put\r\n  up, the bulkheads, stringer plates, and keelsons are added in due\r\n  succession, and the outside shell is being fitted and riveted. Thus\r\n  the full and perfect form of the vessel is gradually developed,\r\n  and exhibits one of the most interesting and useful productions\r\n  of man’s labour. In the bending shop alluded to are several large\r\n  Gorman furnaces, 25 smithy fires for heating angle irons, several\r\n  sets of plate-bending rolls, five stands of vertical drilling\r\n  machines with several spindles each, a huge punching machine\r\n  capable of producing ten rivet holes at each operation, squeezers,\r\n  boring, planing, counter-sinking, plate-bending, plate planing,\r\n  numerous punching and shearing machines, and other appliances.\r\n  The motive power of this section is supplied by a powerful set of\r\n  engines lately erected by the firm.\r\n\r\n  Immediately to the front of this building are the slips, which\r\n  extend 1,200 feet along the Clyde, and admit of 12 to 14 vessels\r\n  being proceeded with at one time. While proceeding among the slips\r\n  hydraulic riveters may be observed at work on several structural\r\n  features. The attention given to such machines in the preceding\r\n  chapter makes further notice here unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  When a steamship leaves the ways she is towed into the firm’s tidal\r\n  dock to receive the boilers and machinery. With the assistance of a\r\n  pair of 80-ton sheer-legs, Messrs Elder & Co. are able to complete\r\n  this part of the construction of a vessel with wonderful despatch.\r\n  In connection with this section is a smithy and small mechanics’\r\n  shop, which are alongside of the wharf. Space will not permit a\r\n  description of the smiths’ shop, the paint shop, riggers’ loft,\r\n  plumbers’ shop, belt-makers’ shop, boat-builders’ shop, block and\r\n  pattern-makers’ shop, pattern store, general store, &c., about each\r\n  of which much of interest might be written.\r\n\r\n  The wood-working department, though stocked with the most approved\r\n  labour-saving appliances, still affords employment to several\r\n  hundreds of hands. In the saw mill, which is about 100 feet square,\r\n  there are several sets of steam saw frames, circular saws, planing\r\n  machines for operating on deck planks, and other tools, the\r\n  producing capacity of which is very large. Adjacent to this is the\r\n  spar shed, where all the spars required on board the vessels are\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  In the joiners’ shops are numerous wood-working machines, which\r\n  are placed advantageously all through this department, comprising\r\n  planing, morticing, and moulding machines, circular and fret saws,\r\n  surface planing and jointing machines, general joiners, lathes,\r\n  and a variety of other tools from the most noted makers of this\r\n  class of mechanism. The cabinetmaker’s shop is a spacious one, and\r\n  here the finer class of interior fittings are seen in all stages\r\n  of progress. Nothing in this section seems omitted in the way of\r\n  mechanical appliances to afford the utmost facility for rapid\r\n  production and excellence of workmanship.\r\n\r\n  The marine engineering department of the business is conducted\r\n  in an imposing pile of buildings about 300 feet square. This\r\n  immense shop is 50 feet high, and is divided into four bays, or\r\n  compartments, by three spacious galleries of two floors, each\r\n  30 feet wide, and extending the entire length of the building.\r\n  These galleries serve the double purpose of supporting powerful\r\n  travelling cranes (two of which are capable of lifting loads\r\n  of 40 tons, and the other two lesser weights), and providing\r\n  convenient retreats where boilermaking, copperwork, and other\r\n  operations are conducted. It is doubtful if a similar collection\r\n  of ponderous tools is to be found anywhere else in Great Britain.\r\n  Notable among the heavy tools seen here in operation is one of\r\n  enormous proportions for planing and trimming armour plates, being\r\n  capable of smoothing a surface 20 feet by 6 feet. There are three\r\n  self-acting screw-cutting lathes, two slotting machines of great\r\n  power, a universal radial drilling machine, with a radius of 18\r\n  feet, capable of boring a hole 4 inches in diameter, through a 9\r\n  inch plate in half-an-hour; a turning lathe having a 10-ft. spindle\r\n  with a diameter of 20-ins.; a planing machine which cuts either\r\n  horizontally or vertically, and has a traverse of 15 feet by 12\r\n  feet; two vertical boring machines, each with a travel of 5 feet;\r\n  a turning lathe 8½ feet in diameter, with a 34 feet shaft; and a\r\n  terrible and mysterious-looking machine, with a metallic disc 18\r\n  feet in diameter, armed with powerful steel cutters fixed round its\r\n  circumference, which takes a shaving of 2½ inches off the mass of\r\n  iron upon which it is operating. This machine was the invention of\r\n  the late Mr Elder’s father, and is one of the most wonderful tools\r\n  in existence. Adjoining this engine shop is the forge, which, with\r\n  its 50 fires, 16 steam hammers, and all the necessary appurtenances\r\n  to produce forgings with despatch, is an exceedingly busy section\r\n  of the works. It is 300 feet long and 100 feet wide; and being\r\n  lofty, excellent ventilation is obtained.\r\n\r\n  There are three smithies of large dimensions—one being retained\r\n  for heavy work, and the others for light work. In connection\r\n  with the engine shop is a pattern shop which, like all the other\r\n  wood-working departments of the premises, is fully provided with\r\n  tools having the most modern improvements. The brass foundry is\r\n  well appointed, and is arranged in two sections—one for light, and\r\n  the other for heavy work. Manganese bronze propellers, of which the\r\n  firm make a speciality, are made here in great numbers; the monthly\r\n  output of this department amounts to 45 tons, all of which is used\r\n  up in the yard, with the exception of a number of propellers which\r\n  the firm supply to other shipbuilders.\r\n\r\n  The capabilities of the Fairfield establishment, it may readily\r\n  be believed, are of the highest order. Scarcely anything need\r\n  be said in substantiation of this, as the past few years have\r\n  witnessed the continuous production from its stocks of very many\r\n  steamships of the highest class, whose names have already become\r\n  “household words.” Of these it may be sufficient to instance the\r\n  _Arizona_, the _Alaska_, the _Austral_, the _Stirling Castle_, and\r\n  the _Oregon_. Apart from these, and perhaps no less worthy examples\r\n  of Fairfield work, vessels of war have been turned out to a goodly\r\n  extent, as well as vessels for a great variety of trades, but it is\r\n  for the fast mail and passenger steamships that the establishment\r\n  is chiefly famed. Its reputation in this respect bids fair to be\r\n  augmented by the production of the two powerful Cunard steamers\r\n  already referred to in this work, and which are now nearing\r\n  completion.\r\n\r\n  The following tabulated form shows the amount of tonnage built, and\r\n  the horse-power of engines fitted, by Messrs Elder & Co. during the\r\n  past fourteen years:—\r\n\r\n  +--------+----------+----------++--------+----------+----------+\r\n  | Years. | Tonnage. |   H.P.   || Years. | Tonnage. |   H.P.   |\r\n  |        |  Gross.  |Indicated.||        |  Gross.  |Indicated.|\r\n  +--------+----------+----------++--------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  1870  |  22,795  |  18,139  ||  1877  |   7,704  |   9,550  |\r\n  |  1871  |  31,889  |  29,000  ||  1878  |  18,247  |  11,750  |\r\n  |  1872  |  24,510  |  22,450  ||  1879  |  16,895  |  15,510  |\r\n  |  1873  |  24,829  |  18,300  ||  1880  |  32,775  |  38,024  |\r\n  |  1874  |  31,016  |  16,110  ||  1881  |  26,575  |  43,728  |\r\n  |  1875  |  17,818  |  12,040  ||  1882  |  31,686  |  41,192  |\r\n  |  1876  |  13,533  |  16,550  ||  1883  |  40,115  |  56,995  |\r\n  +--------+----------+----------++--------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n  During ordinarily busy periods the number of operatives employed\r\n  by Messrs Elder & Co. reaches six thousand. The united earnings of\r\n  this great army of workmen amount to over £33,000 per month. As\r\n  a further indication of the stupendousness of the works, it may\r\n  be mentioned that on board a single vessel—the _Umbria_—as many\r\n  as 1,200 workmen have been employed at one time. The supervision\r\n  of affairs in this great establishment is, as may readily be\r\n  understood, a matter necessitating numerous “heads,” “sub-heads,”\r\n  and departments. The general manager in the shipyard is Mr J. W.\r\n  Shepherd, a naval architect of well-approved ability.\r\n\r\nThe second of the three Clyde establishments selected for notice, and\r\none in many ways specially noteworthy is:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSRS WILLIAM DENNY & BROTHERS’ LEVEN SHIPYARD, DUMBARTON.\r\n\r\n  The firm of William Denny & Brothers, Dumbarton, began the business\r\n  of iron shipbuilding in the year 1844, in a small yard situated\r\n  on the east bank of the river Leven. To this they subsequently\r\n  added the “Woodyard” on the opposite side of the river, which\r\n  had been occupied for a considerable period by William Denny the\r\n  elder, builder of the “Marjory,” “Rob Roy,” and many other notable\r\n  craft, during the infancy of steam navigation. The composition\r\n  of the firm at the outset comprised William, Alexander, and\r\n  Peter, sons of the builder of the “Marjory,” but it was augmented\r\n  after a time by the assumption of two other brothers, James and\r\n  Archibald. The co-partnery some time after again underwent change\r\n  when the two brothers Alexander and Archibald seceded, and formed\r\n  small yards of their own. In 1854 the firm sustained an almost\r\n  irreparable loss in the death of William, the original promoter\r\n  of the concern, to whose energy and surpassing skill most of the\r\n  success then attained was due. His decease was deeply lamented, not\r\n  only as an irreparable family bereavement, but as a public loss.\r\n  When he first devoted his energies to the formation of an iron\r\n  shipbuilding concern, it was at a time of great industrial gloom in\r\n  the community. With its successful establishment began a brighter\r\n  era in the industrial and social history of the burgh—one which has\r\n  never once been seriously interrupted, and seems only now to be\r\n  approaching the “high noon” of its prosperity. Sometime subsequent\r\n  to the decease of William, the co-partnery was further reduced\r\n  through the death of James. For a considerable time thereafter the\r\n  business was carried on by Peter alone, until in 1868 he was joined\r\n  by his eldest son William, and 1871 by Mr Walter Brock—co-partner\r\n  in the firm of Denny & Coy.: a distinct marine engineering business\r\n  established by Peter Denny and others in 1851. Within the past\r\n  three years farther accessions to the firm have been made in Mr\r\n  James Denny, son of James of the original firm, and in Messrs Peter\r\n  Denny, John M. Denny, and Archibald Denny, sons of Peter, and\r\n  younger brothers of William, who for some time has been managing\r\n  partner of the shipbuilding firm, as Mr Brock is of the engine\r\n  works.\r\n\r\n  In 1867 the firm transferred their establishment to the present\r\n  site on the east bank of the river Leven near its confluence\r\n  with the Clyde, and under the shadow of the Castle-rock, which\r\n  figures largely, alike in the scenic renown and the historic annals\r\n  of Scotland. Through a most elaborate series of extensions and\r\n  improvements carried out within the past two-and-a-half years,\r\n  the works have been enlarged to more than double their previous\r\n  dimensions, and correspondingly increased in working capability.\r\n  They occupy a total area of forty-three acres, over five acres of\r\n  which are taken up with wet dock accommodation, and as much as\r\n  seven-and-a-half acres with workshops, sheds, and roofed spaces\r\n  of various kinds. The yard has a most advantageous and extensive\r\n  frontage to the Leven, which, under the provisions of a recently\r\n  obtained Harbour Act, is being greatly improved as regards width\r\n  and deepening. The principal launching berths, eight in number,\r\n  are ranged about the centre portion of the yard’s length, and\r\n  their projections into the river Leven, favoured by a bend at this\r\n  part, are almost in the direct line of its course. Through the\r\n  recent improvements, these berths are capable of receiving vessels\r\n  of dimensions and tonnage such as the present race for big ships\r\n  has not even approached. The arrangement permits of eight vessels\r\n  being built of lengths ranging gradually from a maximum of 750 feet\r\n  downwards. Besides these principal berths, there are spaces near\r\n  the south end of the yard, where light-draught paddle-steamers and\r\n  the smaller class of screw vessels are constructed and launched, or\r\n  taken to pieces and shipped abroad. All the work of construction,\r\n  fitting out, and putting machinery on board ship, is accomplished\r\n  within the yard gates. Contributing to this result are two tidal\r\n  docks, one newly formed, of over four acres in extent, and another\r\n  of over an acre. The bottom of the new dock is 26 feet below the\r\n  level of the yard and wharfage, affording at high tide 20 feet of\r\n  water. In connection with the dock, powerful sheer-legs are being\r\n  erected by Messrs Day & Summers, of Southampton, capable of lifting\r\n  the enormous weight of one hundred tons. Alongside of the smaller\r\n  dock are a pair of sheer-legs, capable of lifting 50 tons, with\r\n  two subsidiary cranes of 10 tons each. For all purposes, either\r\n  of construction or outfit of the largest vessel, these and the\r\n  other enlarged resources place the firm in a position of entire\r\n  independence with regard to extraneous accommodation or appliances.\r\n  The engines and boilers for Messrs Denny Brothers’ vessels are\r\n  invariably supplied by Messrs Denny & Company, whose large works,\r\n  greatly extended within recent years, are situated further up the\r\n  Leven. Along the eastern boundary of the Leven Shipyard, for over\r\n  1000 feet of its length, the joiners’ shops, blacksmiths’ shops,\r\n  machine sheds, outfit stores, &c., are ranged. The joiners’ shops\r\n  are most admirable for the completeness of their appointment. They\r\n  occupy the ground floor and first flat of a three-storey building,\r\n  250 feet by 65 feet, forming part of the range spoken of. The\r\n  machines contained in these apartments are of the newest and most\r\n  approved description of both British and American make, and embrace\r\n  moulding, planing, mortising, tenoning, dove-tailing, nibbling,\r\n  scraping, and sand-papering machines; circular, band, and cross-cut\r\n  saws; also machines for decorative carving and incising, &c., the\r\n  whole being driven by a special engine of considerable power,\r\n  located near the building. A large sawmill and shed, containing\r\n  various wood-working machines, are situate close to the Leven, near\r\n  the south end of the yard, and all the wood employed in the yard\r\n  is here cut from the rough. The blacksmiths’ and angle smiths’\r\n  shops and the machine sheds are correspondingly well furnished\r\n  with the most modern appliances. The former of these contain\r\n  over fifty fires, and ten steam hammers, as well as verticals,\r\n  lathes, &c., conveniently situated. The latter are splendidly\r\n  equipped, containing several large plate rolls, planing machines,\r\n  beam-bending machines, and an assortment of multiple drills and\r\n  counter-sinking machines of the most modern type; also a large\r\n  number of punching and shearing machines, including two man-hole\r\n  punches capable of piercing 30 by 20-in. holes in plates ¾-inch\r\n  thick. The plate and frame furnace, bending block, and scrive board\r\n  accommodation throughout the yard, is of extent commensurate with\r\n  the other features above described, all of which being of recent\r\n  formation, are of the most approved and modern description.\r\n\r\n  The system of railways throughout the shipyard is of an unusually\r\n  complete description. Connection is made with the main line of the\r\n  North British Railway, and enters the yard on its north side, where\r\n  a store-yard of about two acres affords ample storage accommodation\r\n  for material in steel and iron. Leaving this and traversing the\r\n  building yard throughout, the lines of railway are designed to\r\n  permit of material being conveyed without retrocession to the\r\n  vessel of which they are to form part, but with the stoppages\r\n  necessary for their being put through the various courses of\r\n  manipulation. In addition, the yard is traversed in directions\r\n  and to situations inaccessible to the main lines of rails, by the\r\n  narrow gauge portable system, patented by M. Decauville, which is\r\n  of great service.\r\n\r\n  A special department in the establishment of Messrs Denny, and an\r\n  entirely novel feature in a private shipyard, is the experimental\r\n  tank, already referred to in the Chapter on scientific progress.\r\n  This notable section of Messrs Denny’s works may be described as\r\n  consisting of a basin 300 feet long, 22 feet wide, and containing\r\n  9 feet of water over the principal portion of its length. Around\r\n  this basin are the shops and appliances for the work which has\r\n  to be done—constructive, experimental, and analytical. This work\r\n  on the constructive side consists of making paraffine models,\r\n  which represent on an appropriate scale the ships to which the\r\n  experiments have reference; the paraffine is melted, cast in a\r\n  rough mould to the approximate shape, and afterwards faired off\r\n  by a specially-constructed and very ingenious cutting machine.\r\n  When finished the model is passed on to the second stage—the\r\n  experimental. A stationary engine draws a carriage along a railway\r\n  suspended above the water space, the carriage is accompanied by\r\n  the model, with an attachment which allows the model to move\r\n  freely, and at the same time to depend entirely for its propelling\r\n  force upon a spring carried by the carriage. The extensions of\r\n  this spring are measured and recorded automatically, so too are\r\n  the speeds, the record being made by electric pens in the form of\r\n  diagrams, on a revolving cylinder which is part of the apparatus\r\n  of the carriage. The analytical work consists of obtaining from\r\n  the diagrams the items of speed and propelling force, the relation\r\n  between which, at all speeds for which the experiments have been\r\n  made, is thus obtained. The facilities which are offered by the\r\n  tank for investigating to the utmost the laws of hydrodynamics\r\n  in so far as they affect, practically, the resistance of ships,\r\n  is thus obvious. On the facade of the tank, fronting the public\r\n  street, Messrs Denny have placed an admirably-sculptured medallion\r\n  portrait of the late Mr William Froude, of Torquay, the noted\r\n  experimentalist. Underneath is the following inscription:—“This\r\n  facade of the Leven Shipyard Experimental Tank is erected in\r\n  memory of the late William Froude, F.R.S., L.L.D., the greatest\r\n  of experimenters and investigators of hydrodynamics. Born 29th\r\n  November, 1811. Died 14th May, 1879.”\r\n\r\n  Telephonic communication having previously been established with\r\n  advantage between Leven Shipyard and the Engine Works of Messrs\r\n  Denny & Co., towards the close of 1883 a telephone exchange\r\n  system was established in the shipyard, by which means twenty-six\r\n  separate places are in communication with one another. These are\r\n  the residences of the principal members of the firm, the manager’s\r\n  house, the Levenbank Foundry, the Dennystown Forge, four stations\r\n  at the Engine Works, and seventeen stations within the shipyard,\r\n  representing in all from six to seven miles of line wire. The\r\n  electric light has already been partially introduced into the\r\n  shipyard, but steps have been taken by the firm for further\r\n  extending it to the various offices, the experimental tank, the\r\n  joiners’ shop, and the upholstery and decorators’ rooms, as well as\r\n  providing arc lamps of great power to light up the area of the yard\r\n  itself.\r\n\r\n  Besides the introduction of the electric light into their yard,\r\n  Messrs Denny have formed an electrical department in connection\r\n  with their works, which will not only be employed in arranging\r\n  and maintaining the yard installation, but will also undertake\r\n  the fitting of the electric light installations on board vessels\r\n  built in the yard. To supervise and manage this important\r\n  department—which, it may be remarked, is entirely novel as a branch\r\n  of shipyard work—the firm have engaged the services of a skilled\r\n  electrician, under whom a staff of operative electricians are\r\n  employed.\r\n\r\n  On account of the increased employment it brings to their\r\n  townspeople, and also doubtless on grounds of increased economy and\r\n  efficiency, Messrs Denny seek to overtake, as much as possible,\r\n  the entire work connected with a ship’s construction and outfit\r\n  in their own establishment. Towards the close of 1881 they began\r\n  the introduction of a department for the designing, decoration,\r\n  and furnishing of the saloons of their vessels. This department\r\n  is now of established importance in the yard, and embraces four\r\n  more or less distinct branches. Firstly, the architectural and\r\n  decorative designs of the various saloons are determined upon by\r\n  what may be called the architectural branch, under the immediate\r\n  supervision of a professionally-trained architect. The work of\r\n  practically carrying out these designs is at present entrusted to\r\n  three sections of workers. (1) The decorative department, proper,\r\n  which overtakes the painting of the various ornamental panels,\r\n  dados, friezes, &c., of the saloons, and the staining of the\r\n  coloured glass used in saloon windows, skylights, doors, &c. (2)\r\n  The carving department, in which the carved work fitted on the bow\r\n  and stern of vessels, also the numerous small pieces of carved work\r\n  introduced into the architectural arrangement of the saloons, are\r\n  overtaken. (3) The upholstery department, in which all the work\r\n  connected with upholstering the saloons and state-rooms—usually,\r\n  in other yards, made the subject of sub-contract—is overtaken\r\n  from first to last. In this branch female labour is employed to a\r\n  considerable extent, while much of the decorative painting referred\r\n  to above is also done by females. Under the guidance of a lady\r\n  artist, the employés in this branch have evinced much aptitude and\r\n  taste for the work.\r\n\r\n  Successive enlargements and increased appliances have now rendered\r\n  the Leven Shipyard capable of turning out from 40,000 to 60,000\r\n  tons of shipping per annum. The work hitherto achieved has been\r\n  almost exclusively that of steamship building, but inside of that\r\n  general limitation it has been of a varied and comprehensive\r\n  description. Steamships for many of the largest ocean and\r\n  coast-trading companies, gun-boats and transport ships for foreign\r\n  Governments, and light-draught paddle-steamers for the rivers\r\n  Volga, Danube, Ganges, and Irrawaddy, have all been furnished from\r\n  the stocks of Leven Shipyard. The accompanying list, which is of\r\n  work done during the period of the firm’s existence, viz., since\r\n  1844, affords at once an adequate conception of the large amount of\r\n  important work done for the better-known shipping companies:—\r\n\r\n                                          No. of Vessels.

The\r\n  following exhibits in tabular form the number and tonnage of\r\n  vessels built by the firm from their beginning the business of iron\r\n  shipbuilding in 1845 up to and including 1883:—\r\n\r\n  +------+--------+--------++------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Year. | No. of |Tonnage.||Year. | No. of |Tonnage.|\r\n  |      |Vessels.|        ||      |Vessels.|        |\r\n  +------+--------+--------++------+--------+--------+\r\n  | 1845 |    3   |    365 || 1865 |    6   |  4,543 |\r\n  | 1846 |    3   |    252 || 1866 |    8   | 10,867 |\r\n  | 1847 |    6   |  1,007 || 1867 |    4   |  9,154 |\r\n  | 1848 |    3   |    618 || 1868 |    8   |  9,855 |\r\n  | 1849 |    6   |  2,173 || 1869 |   12   | 13,227 |\r\n  | 1850 |    5   |  1,577 || 1870 |    4   |  8,852 |\r\n  | 1851 |    5   |  1,460 || 1871 |    7   | 14,922 |\r\n  | 1852 |    5   |  6,622 || 1872 |    6   | 14,056 |\r\n  | 1853 |    7   |  5,163 || 1873 |    7   | 18,415 |\r\n  | 1854 |    5   |  4,380 || 1874 |    9   | 18,475 |\r\n  | 1855 |    6   |  5,443 || 1875 |    9   | 17,191 |\r\n  | 1856 |    7   |  7,436 || 1876 |    5   |  4,394 |\r\n  | 1857 |    5   |  2,822 || 1877 |   10   | 10,533 |\r\n  | 1858 |    3   |  5,293 || 1878 |   18   | 22,054 |\r\n  | 1859 |    5   |  5,903 || 1879 |   13   | 16,138 |\r\n  | 1860 |    2   |  1,897 || 1880 |   12   | 18,114 |\r\n  | 1861 |    4   |  8,463 || 1881 |    8   | 17,455 |\r\n  | 1862 |    5   |  4,271 || 1882 |   13   | 22,010 |\r\n  | 1863 |    9   |  9,745 || 1883 |   10   | 22,240 |\r\n  | 1864 |   13   | 11,239 ||      |        |        |\r\n  +------+--------+--------++------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  The firm, it may be stated, is now engaged in the construction of\r\n  their 300th vessel. Notwithstanding the work of re-arrangement and\r\n  enlargement which has been under progress for two years or more,\r\n  the work turned out during that period has been in no way behind as\r\n  compared with other periods—a fact which eloquently testifies to\r\n  the administrative ability of those in authority, and to the skill\r\n  and energy of Mr John Ward, the general manager of Messrs Denny’s\r\n  large works.\r\n\r\n  In August, 1880, the firm issued a notice to their workmen\r\n  stating that, having observed during the previous two years many\r\n  improvements in methods of work and appliances introduced by them\r\n  into the yard, they very readily recognised the advantage accruing\r\n  to their business from these efforts of their workmen’s skill, and\r\n  were desirous that they should not pass unrewarded. The notice\r\n  further stated that to carry out this desire an Awards Committee\r\n  had been appointed, which would consider any claims made by the\r\n  workmen, and grant an award in proportion to the worth of the\r\n  improvement made, the amount in no case to be more than £10, or\r\n  less than £2. The committee then appointed, and which still holds\r\n  office, was composed of well-known local gentlemen, in every way\r\n  competent to adjudicate. Fully a year later the firm announced that\r\n  in the case of an invention thought worthy of a greater award than\r\n  £10, they had empowered the Committee to grant such an award, or\r\n  were willing, in addition to giving an award of £10, to take out\r\n  at their own expense provisional protection at the Patent Office\r\n  on behalf of the inventor, so that he might either dispose of his\r\n  invention or complete the patent, provided always they had free use\r\n  of the thing patented in their own establishment. From the reports\r\n  which have yearly been issued by the committee, it is apparent\r\n  that considerable success has attended the scheme. The number of\r\n  claims made since its institution has been as follows:—In 1880, 12;\r\n  in 1881, 32; in 1882, 27; in 1883, 20; in 1884 (till July only),\r\n  91; total, 182. Awards have been granted as follows:—In 1880, 5;\r\n  in 1881, 22; in 1882, 21; in 1883, 18; in 1884 (till July only),\r\n  27; total, 93. It is worthy of note that about one-half of the\r\n  awards have been gained by workmen in the joiner’s department.\r\n  Some of their machines have been modified or altered so as to\r\n  do twice the quantity of work previously possible, some to do a\r\n  new class of work, and others to do the same work with greater\r\n  ease and safety. Four inventions have gained the maximum award\r\n  of £10, viz., (1) an improvement made on ships’ water-closet and\r\n  urinal; (2) the invention of a machine to cut mouldings imitative\r\n  of wicker work; (3) an improved arrangement for disengaging steam\r\n  and hand-steering gear on board ship; (4) an improved method of\r\n  laying the Decauville railway across the main line. In connection\r\n  with this latter invention, the patentee of the Decauville railway\r\n  system, supplemented the committee’s grant to the extent of £10. In\r\n  a note to last year’s report, the firm state that they have decided\r\n  to increase the maximum grant from £10 to £12, and the minimum from\r\n  £2 to £3; and that in the case of two men being engaged at the same\r\n  invention, should it be found worthy of an award, each will receive\r\n  at least the minimum award of £3. A still more recent announcement\r\n  states that “whenever any workman has received as many as _five_\r\n  awards from the committee, reckoning from the time the scheme came\r\n  in force, he shall be paid a premium of £20, when he has received\r\n  as many as _ten_ awards he shall be paid a further premium of\r\n  £25—the premiums always increasing by £5 for every additional five\r\n  awards received.” Already, it may be stated, four separate workmen\r\n  have received _five_ awards, and become the recipients of the £20\r\n  premium.\r\n\r\n  With regard to the employment of females in Messrs Denny’s yard,\r\n  it may be interesting to state further that the total number\r\n  generally employed throughout the works amounts to between 80\r\n  and 100. In addition to the numbers employed in the decorative\r\n  and upholstery departments, already noticed, a large contingent\r\n  are engaged in the polishing rooms, and a further number in the\r\n  drawing offices as tracers. The employment of females as tracers\r\n  in shipyard drawing offices, it may be stated, is of recent date.\r\n  The system had previously been in operation at the locomotive\r\n  works of Messrs Dübs & Co., and Messrs Neilson & Co., of Glasgow.\r\n  Having proved a success there, it has been gradually adopted by\r\n  shipbuilding and engineering firms on the Clyde, and more recently\r\n  on the Tyne. The staff in Leven Shipyard consists of 20 members,\r\n  four of whom are employed in the experimental tank department. All\r\n  the girls are selected by written competitive examination, the\r\n  subjects of examination being arithmetic, writing to dictation, and\r\n  block-letter printing. At first it was intended the girls should\r\n  simply be trained as tracers, but they displayed such aptitude that\r\n  to tracing was added the inking-in of finished drawings and the\r\n  reduction of plans from a greater to a less scale. This they do\r\n  with a very fair degree of accuracy and neatness. The experienced\r\n  members of the staff are now employed making displacement\r\n  calculations, including plotting the results to scale, centre of\r\n  buoyancy, and metacentre calculations; calculations of ships’\r\n  surface, working up and plotting of speed trial results, stability\r\n  calculations. Most of these calculations are made out on prepared\r\n  printed schedules, and the whole of the work is superintended by\r\n  a member of the male staff. In the work of calculation the girls,\r\n  it may be stated, make large use of such instruments as the slide\r\n  rule, Amsler’s planimeter and integrator. To secure clearness and\r\n  uniformity in the work of writing titles, data, scantling, &c., on\r\n  the various drawings and tracings, it was found advisable to train\r\n  the females in the art of lettering these features in a uniform\r\n  style of lettering in place of writing them. In this work they\r\n  display considerable proficiency and expertness, the results being\r\n  uniformly legible and well arranged.\r\n\r\n  Before passing from the subject of female employment in Messrs\r\n  Denny’s establishment, attention should be drawn to one fact, of\r\n  which assurances have been given by those well informed in the\r\n  matter. In no instance has the employment of females led to the\r\n  displacement of men as yard operatives. Those departments into\r\n  which females have recently been introduced are now numerically\r\n  as large as before the innovation. In some cases, indeed, the\r\n  numbers are greater than before; new avenues of labour, and\r\n  greater elaboration of the old, being the grounds of need for the\r\n  accessions.\r\n\r\nThe other establishment selected for notice from the Clyde district\r\nis:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSRS J. & G. THOMSON’S\r\n  SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING WORKS,\r\n  CLYDEBANK.\r\n\r\n  The business of this firm was founded in 1846, by Messrs James\r\n  & George Thomson, father and uncle respectively of the present\r\n  members of the firm. Originally the firm were engineers, but in\r\n  1851, shipbuilding operations were commenced, the yard being\r\n  then situated in the upper reaches of the Clyde. Twenty years\r\n  later the increase of the firm’s business and the demand for\r\n  better accommodation for shipping made it necessary for the firm\r\n  to take new ground. The present site at Clydebank was therefore\r\n  chosen for their shipyard, and since its formation many wonderful\r\n  transformations have been effected. It is fully twelve years\r\n  since ground was first broken. At that time there was neither\r\n  house nor railway accommodation, and the difficulties were not\r\n  easily surmountable, and it must have been determined courage and\r\n  energy that in such a short time not only formed such a large\r\n  establishment, but created a town, and introduced a railway. From\r\n  Clydebank yard, it may be needless to state, many of the most\r\n  famous vessels of the Cunard, Peninsular, and Oriental and Union\r\n  Lines have been launched. From its stocks have emanated such\r\n  well-known vessels as the _Bothnia_, _Gallia_, _Thames_, _Moor_,\r\n  _Hammonia_, and the great Cunard liner, _Servia_, while within a\r\n  very recent period another vessel—the _America_—seemingly destined\r\n  to eclipse the fame of all these other notable craft, has been\r\n  built and sent to sea.\r\n\r\n  Until about two years ago, the engineering section of Messrs\r\n  Thomson’s business was conducted at Clydebank Foundry, Finnieston,\r\n  Glasgow. It was then resolved, however, to centralise the\r\n  works, and thus save the great expense of fitting out vessels\r\n  away from the yard, as well as secure the increased facilities\r\n  offered in the management and controlling of large bodies of\r\n  workmen. This important undertaking has now been accomplished,\r\n  and the establishment, as now arranged, is equal in extent and\r\n  working capability to any other private shipbuilding concern.\r\n  The entire premises occupy about thirty-five acres of land, and\r\n  comprise building yard, tidal basin, yard workshops, and engine\r\n  and boiler works. When in full operation the establishment gives\r\n  employment to over 4,000 workmen. The yard possesses eight\r\n  building slips, laid out for the largest class of vessels, and\r\n  owing to their situation—facing the river Cart, which here joins\r\n  the Clyde—excellent facilities for the launching of vessels are\r\n  afforded.\r\n\r\n  Proceeding to describe the works more in detail, as in the case\r\n  of a personal visit, the first feature that may be noticed is\r\n  a handsome block of buildings which stands some distance from\r\n  the main entrance to the shipyard. These buildings comprise the\r\n  clerical, managerial, and naval architects’ offices; also a\r\n  spacious apartment in which are located splendidly-executed models,\r\n  and sections of the hulls, of the vessels which have been built\r\n  by the firm. Passing through the yard large quantities of the raw\r\n  material of the modern shipbuilder are observed on railway waggons,\r\n  and in sheds—including iron and steel plates, bar, T, H, Z, angle,\r\n  flat, channel, tubular, and other forms of wrought-iron. This\r\n  material is brought into the yard by railway, which forms a siding\r\n  of the North British system about a quarter of a mile distant.\r\n\r\n  The iron and steel plates are first manipulated in a large shed\r\n  open at the sides and ends, and measuring some 500 feet by 150.\r\n  Here are situated a large number of powerful machine-tools—bending\r\n  and straightening machines, punching and shearing machines,\r\n  drilling machines, hydraulic riveting machines and the like. Some\r\n  are of the largest sizes made, one punching machine being a 33-inch\r\n  gap tool. Several other machine-tools in this large shed have\r\n  special features worthy of notice, and one in particular, a flat\r\n  keel plate bending machine, must be referred to with some detail.\r\n  The machine in question was made by the Messrs Thomson themselves,\r\n  and constitutes perhaps the latest application of machinery to\r\n  shipbuilding purposes. It is supplied by hydraulic power from the\r\n  accumulator that works the riveting plant—which is on the Tweddell\r\n  system—and is composed of a number of arms resting on a horizontal\r\n  bar. The arms are raised or lowered to suit the different shapes\r\n  required, by means of a hydraulic ram placed at each end and\r\n  pressing upon the horizontal bars.\r\n\r\n  Leaving the machine-tool shed, which, by the way, is amply\r\n  provided, as indeed are the works generally, with travelling and\r\n  fixed lifting appliances, and while _en route_ for the smiths’\r\n  shop, are observed several isolated punching and shearing and other\r\n  machine-tools for special purposes, and driven by self-contained\r\n  engines or hydraulic power. The smiths’ shop is a well-arranged\r\n  workshop, 600 feet long by 60 feet wide, and contains 108 smiths’\r\n  fires, besides three furnaces at each end for heating frames\r\n  and plates, for bending and other manipulative purposes. This\r\n  department is well supplied with the mechanical contrivances of the\r\n  forge, including steam hammers of various capacities graduating\r\n  from 12 cwt. up to over one ton. There are 16 small jobbing hammers\r\n  in this shop; a massive 70-cwt. hammer of Messrs Thomson’s own\r\n  make, is used in the production of stern-posts, rudders, and heavy\r\n  forgings. The smiths’ shop is built upon excellent and somewhat\r\n  unusual principles, the roof being so constructed as to readily\r\n  admit of the egress of the smoke from the fires, thus securing good\r\n  ventilation.\r\n\r\n  An engineering and machine shop, well equipped with lathes, drills,\r\n  and other appliances, limited to the operations connected with the\r\n  production of water-tight doors, steering gears, and the like,\r\n  is next passed. In close proximity is the riggers loft, where a\r\n  large staff of workmen, with the aid of mechanical contrivances,\r\n  manipulate the rigging for the vessels nearing completion in the\r\n  dock. The firm’s well-appointed saw mills are provided with a full\r\n  complement of sawing machinery, much of it of a special and very\r\n  cleverly contrived character. One machine, for instance, is capable\r\n  of cross-cutting and ripping a log into the required sizes right\r\n  away, without the usual intermediate manipulation. The arrangements\r\n  for conveying the timber into position, and for removing it\r\n  when cut, are very complete, and eminently calculated to ensure\r\n  rapidity of production. In convenient proximity to the saw mills\r\n  are the “saw-doctor’s” quarters. The old-fashioned practice of\r\n  sharpening the teeth of the saws by hand-filing is discarded here\r\n  in favour of a more rapid and effective method of obtaining the\r\n  requisite amount of sharpness and “set.” Emery-wheels are employed\r\n  and accomplish the process with a great saving of time and labour.\r\n\r\n  Amongst the other departments with regard to which no details need\r\n  be given, yet all of which are admirably appointed, are the brass\r\n  foundry and finishing shops, where the brass castings and fittings\r\n  are prepared. The joiners’, carpenters’, and cabinetmakers’ shops\r\n  are an important and extensive branch of the Clydebank premises.\r\n  The building in which they are located measures 220 feet in\r\n  length, by 156 feet in width. Here the ordinary ship-joinery work\r\n  is undertaken, and the tasteful and magnificent furnishings, used\r\n  in the luxurious equipment of the vessels built in the yard, are\r\n  produced in great numbers. The joiners’ and cabinetmakers’ shops\r\n  are provided with a vast number of ingenious sawing, wood-working,\r\n  as well as the more ordinary joinery appliances, manufactured\r\n  for the greater part by Messrs J. M‘Dowall & Sons, Johnstone,\r\n  near Glasgow, and Fay & Son, the well-known American house. It\r\n  is noteworthy that the belting for driving the multiplicity\r\n  of machines located in this department is all conducted below\r\n  the floor: in this way a welcome freedom from obstruction, and\r\n  comparative immunity from danger, is effected.\r\n\r\n  A word may be added with regard to the engines and boilers used by\r\n  the firm for driving their machinery. During the day the most of\r\n  the machinery is driven from these main engines, the chief of which\r\n  is a 200 horse-power motor, by Messrs Tangye, of Birmingham; and\r\n  at night the principal machine tools and several of the workshops\r\n  derive their requisite motive power from the small self-contained\r\n  engines, which are attached, or are in close proximity, to them.\r\n\r\n  The engineering and boilermaking section of the works occupies\r\n  in all a space of about 12,000 square yards. The boiler shop is\r\n  a large and lofty galleried workshop, occupying an area of 4,000\r\n  square yards. It is splendidly equipped with all the most modern\r\n  appliances for accurate and heavy work. Attention may specially be\r\n  drawn to an enormous hydraulic riveter, erected by Messrs Brown\r\n  Brothers, of Edinburgh. This riveter, which is just undergoing\r\n  completion, is designed with a 6½ feet gap, and can close with\r\n  ease rivets up to 1¾ inch diameter. It is rendered necessary owing\r\n  to the tendency to greatly increase pressure since the introduction\r\n  of the triple expansion engine. An engine of 100 H.P., having a\r\n  steam accumulator, gives the necessary power for working this, and\r\n  advantage has been taken of the extra power to actuate a system of\r\n  hydraulic hoists, winches and capstans, which are being substituted\r\n  for the coal-devouring and often dangerous donkey boilers and steam\r\n  winches, usually in use for this purpose. The hoists will also be\r\n  applied to the larger latches in order to save manual labour.\r\n\r\n  When ready to be placed on board ship, the boilers are run down\r\n  to the dock by means of a tramway, in the foundations of which as\r\n  many as 600 tons of slag have been packed. The boilers are then\r\n  lifted on board and lowered to their proper place by means of\r\n  massive shear-legs, constructed by Taylor, of Birkenhead, which are\r\n  capable of lifting the enormous weight of 120 tons, and which have\r\n  a foundation composed of some 700 tons of cement.\r\n\r\n  The new engine works comprise erecting, turning, and tool shops,\r\n  smithy, brass foundry, and depot for laying castings and other\r\n  goods, also large stores. The whole cover an area of about 8,000\r\n  square yards, making, with the 4000 square yards occupied by the\r\n  boiler shop, a total area of 12,000 square yards. Machinery by\r\n  the well-known makers, Messrs Shanks, Heatherington, Harvey, and\r\n  others, of the most modern and powerful description, has been laid\r\n  down, also overhead travelling cranes, by Taylor, to lift 30 and\r\n  40 tons respectively. Railways have been introduced throughout\r\n  the shops, and a 6-ton crane locomotive lifts and deposits\r\n  castings where required. In fact, everything that the most modern\r\n  engineering skill could suggest has been introduced in order to\r\n  fit the place for turning out not only the largest class of marine\r\n  engines, but also for the saving of manual labour, and it is\r\n  expected that 50,000 I.H.P. can be turned out per annum. The entire\r\n  premises, it should be stated, are illuminated by the electric\r\n  light, partly on the “Brush” and partly on the “Swan” systems.\r\n  The vessels on the slips and in the dock are also illuminated by\r\n  electric light applied in a portable form.\r\n\r\n  Since having commenced shipbuilding operations, Messrs J. &\r\n  G. Thomson have placed as many as 200 vessels in the water,\r\n  representing an aggregate of 300,000 tons, and a gross capital\r\n  value of about £7,500,000. The position, therefore, that Clydebank\r\n  yard takes amongst the shipbuilding establishments of the United\r\n  Kingdom is certainly in the very front rank. The general manager\r\n  of the extensive works is Mr J. P. Wilson, a gentleman of extended\r\n  experience, who has before held similar posts, but none more\r\n  onerous and exacting. Amongst other of the responsible officials at\r\n  Clydebank of whom mention should be made Mr J. H. Biles, the firm’s\r\n  naval designer, occupies an important position and shares in the\r\n  credit attaching to successful work.\r\n\r\nThe three yards selected from the Clyde district have now been\r\ndescribed, and their distinctive features enlarged upon. In passing\r\nto the notices of the yards from other districts, it may be stated\r\nthat efforts will be made to avoid repetition in details that are\r\nessentially similar. The notices will be of a still more general\r\ncharacter than those preceding, the only portions where anything\r\nlike fullness may occur being those concerned with features which\r\nare not embraced in any of the Clyde yards. The most stupendous and\r\ncomprehensive of the works to be noticed are those of:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  PALMERS SHIPBUILDING AND IRON COMPANY, LIMITED, JARROW-ON-TYNE.\r\n\r\n  Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Limited, have their works at\r\n  Jarrow-on-Tyne, about four miles from the sea. The works embrace\r\n  both banks of the river Tyne, cover nearly 100 acres of land, and\r\n  employ about 7,000 persons. They were first commenced in 1851\r\n  by Mr Charles Mark Palmer, the present M.P. for North Durham,\r\n  distinguished for the active part he has taken and continues to\r\n  take in merchant shipping legislation. In 1865 the works were made\r\n  into a limited company, Mr Palmer becoming chairman. It is a saying\r\n  in Jarrow, with reference to these gigantic works, that the raw\r\n  ironstone is taken in at the one end and launched from the other\r\n  in the form of iron steamships, fitted complete with all their\r\n  machinery, to carry on a large share of the world’s commerce.\r\n  However much this may appear the exaggerated utterance of native\r\n  pride, it must be declared to be a literal truth. The works include\r\n  within themselves the entire range of operations, from the raising\r\n  and smelting of the ironstone to the complete equipment of iron,\r\n  steam and sailing vessels of all sizes. The ore itself, raised at\r\n  the rate of 1,000 tons per day, is brought round by sea from the\r\n  Company’s own mines at Port Mulgrave, near Whitby, in Yorkshire,\r\n  and is lifted from the river wharf at the works up to the railway\r\n  level, along an inclined plane worked by a stationary engine. Coke\r\n  and coal come into the works from Marley Hill and other collieries\r\n  in Durham and Northumberland, by the Pontop and Jarrow Railway. The\r\n  coke is discharged into a hopper capable of holding about 1,500\r\n  tons, from the bottom of which the blast furnace barrows are filled\r\n  through sliding doors, dispensing with manual labour. The four\r\n  blast furnaces are 85 feet high, 24 feet diameter at the boshes,\r\n  and 10 feet in the hearth. They are capable of producing over 2,000\r\n  tons of pig per week, of which more than one-half is used in the\r\n  Company’s works. The blast is heated to about 1,500° Fahr. in eight\r\n  “Whitewell” hot air fire-brick stoves of the newest pattern, and\r\n  there are eighteen kilns for calcining the Cleveland ironstone. The\r\n  rolling mill forge comprises eighty puddling furnaces, producing\r\n  over 1,000 tons of puddled bars weekly; which, again, are rolled\r\n  into plates and angle bars of the largest and smallest sizes used\r\n  in the trade. There are two forge engines with 36-inch cylinders,\r\n  one of 4 feet and the other of 5 feet stroke, each driving a roll\r\n  train and four pairs of 22-inch rolls. There are two plate mills\r\n  and ten mill furnaces, producing about 1,200 tons of finished\r\n  boiler and ship plates weekly. Each mill has two pairs of 24-in.\r\n  rolls, reversed by clutch and crabs; a bar mill with two pairs of\r\n  rolls, driven by a 24-inch cylinder, produces 120 tons per week;\r\n  a fourth mill, with four pairs of rolls, driven by two 30-inch\r\n  cylinders, with 4 feet stroke, produces about 300 tons per week of\r\n  plates; also a large angle and bar mill, driven by a single engine,\r\n  having 36-inch cylinder and 4 feet stroke, capable of rolling the\r\n  very largest angles used in the trade. There is also a sheet mill\r\n  in the forge. Attached to the rolling mills are shears, circular\r\n  saws, punching, and straightening presses, all of the newest\r\n  patterns.\r\n\r\n  The adjoining department is that of the engine works, which is on\r\n  the same gigantic scale, and is capable of finishing about forty\r\n  pairs of marine engines with their boilers, annually, besides a\r\n  proportionate share of replace boilers and repairs. The department\r\n  produces its own iron and brass castings and forgings. In the\r\n  boiler shop of this department vertical rolls for rolling long\r\n  boiler shell plates were first used, and may be seen in operation.\r\n  In the year 1882-83, June to June, thirty-six pairs of\r\n  engines, of 7,300 nominal and 39,240 indicated horse-power, were\r\n  turned out.\r\n\r\n  The next department, occupying the east end of the Company’s works,\r\n  is that of shipbuilding. The shops of this department are fitted\r\n  up with all the newest machines for quick and efficient production\r\n  of work. It contains the largest graving dock on the coast, also\r\n  a very fine patent slip, fitted with hydraulic hauling gear. The\r\n  building slips are suitable for every kind of vessel up to 500 feet\r\n  in length, and are capable, with those in the Howdon branch of the\r\n  works on the opposite side of the river, of launching 70,000 tons\r\n  of shipping annually. There are nine building slips at Jarrow,\r\n  and six at Howdon. In the year 1882-83, June to June, 35 vessels\r\n  of the aggregate tonnage of 68,000 tons were built and delivered\r\n  to their owners. For transporting material throughout the works,\r\n  three steam travelling cranes and eleven locomotive engines are\r\n  employed. For discharging ore, two fixed and two travelling steam\r\n  cranes, also two hydraulic cranes, are in use. At the engine works\r\n  are sheer-legs 100 feet high, capable of lifting 100 tons—used for\r\n  lifting engines and boilers, and for masting the vessels.\r\n\r\n  The output of tonnage by Palmers’ Company for 1882 and that for\r\n  1883 were severally about double the amount turned out by any other\r\n  one firm in existence for these years. The following statement\r\n  of the yearly amount of tonnage turned out by the firm since the\r\n  commencement of iron shipbuilding on the Tyne in 1852, will be\r\n  interesting, as showing the gradual strides by which the firm have\r\n  risen from 920 tons thirty years ago to the wonderful return of\r\n  61,113 tons in 1883:—\r\n\r\n  +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  | Year.

The following are the\r\n  other responsible officials:—Assistant general manager and manager\r\n  of rolling mills, Mr F. W. Stoker; secretary, Mr Hew Steele;\r\n  shipyard manager, Mr A. Adamson; engine works manager, Mr J. P.\r\n  Hall; blast furnaces manager, Mr P. A. Berkeley; blast furnaces\r\n  assistant manager, Mr H. T. Allison; mining engineer, Mr A. S.\r\n  Palmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SIR WM. ARMSTRONG, MITCHELL & CO.’S SHIPBUILDING WORKS,\r\n  LOW WALKER AND ELSWICK-ON-TYNE.\r\n\r\n  The Low Walker yard of this firm was commenced upwards of thirty\r\n  years ago by Messrs C. Mitchell & Co., who up to 1883 (when they\r\n  amalgamated with Sir W. G. Armstrong & Co., the notable firm of\r\n  engineers and artillerists), had built as many as 450 vessels, or\r\n  an average of 15 vessels per annum, the average tonnage produced\r\n  during the last ten years being 23,000 tons. The yard is situated\r\n  about four miles down the Tyne from Newcastle. It consists of\r\n  about fifteen acres of ground, and has nine launching berths, but\r\n  their arrangement is such that at times there have been as many as\r\n  fourteen vessels on the stocks. The establishment is laid out in a\r\n  most modern manner. The space occupied by the building slips has a\r\n  uniform gradient, and, being perfectly flat laterally, gives the\r\n  greatest facility in the movement of bogies. The yard is served by\r\n  two complete systems of railways, respectively on the 4 feet 8-in.\r\n  and 2 feet 3-in. gauge. The former is in connection with a siding\r\n  from the North Eastern Railway, whereby materials and goods can\r\n  be brought from all parts of the kingdom, and two locomotives are\r\n  constantly employed working the trucks into the yard, one of them\r\n  being of very special construction, on Brown’s patent principle,\r\n  manufactured by Messrs R. & W. Hawthorn, Newcastle. This locomotive\r\n  is combined with a steam crane, the jib of which acts as a lever\r\n  with fulcrum, thus dispensing with chains, and which readily swings\r\n  right round, depositing the plates on edge into racks arranged on\r\n  either side of the railway, from which they can be taken with great\r\n  facility by the workmen at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\n  The yard is divided in two by a building 250 feet long by 50 feet\r\n  wide, placed at right angles to the river, and which contains plate\r\n  furnaces, bolt-maker’s shop, plumber’s shop, rivet store, tool\r\n  stores, large bending rolls, straightening machine, and man-hole\r\n  punch, on the ground floor; and on the upper storey rigging loft,\r\n  sail loft, pattern stores, &c. Along the head of the building\r\n  berths in one half of the yard there is a line of machine shops\r\n  400 feet long by 70 feet wide, in one end of which are installed\r\n  frame furnaces, bending blocks, &c., as also a number of powerful\r\n  punching machines, planing machines, special machines for angle\r\n  cutting, and there has recently been added a powerful radial drill,\r\n  having four moveable arms arranged to drill holes in any part of\r\n  plate 16 feet by 4 feet without moving it. At the back of this\r\n  machine shop, and parallel with it, is a smith’s shop 180 feet\r\n  long by 50 feet wide, fitted up complete with steam hammers, &c.\r\n  For the other half of the yard there is a large building 200 feet\r\n  long, and of an average width of about 150 feet, which contains\r\n  furnace, with bending blocks, &c., several heavy punching machines,\r\n  planing machines, drilling and other machines; one portion about 80\r\n  feet by 60 feet being used as a fitting shop, containing powerful\r\n  lathes, radial, and other drilling machines on the ground floor,\r\n  and on the upper floor a lighter class of shaping, drilling, and\r\n  other machines. In this building are also constructed two drying\r\n  stoves, wherein the exhaust steam from the engine is used for\r\n  drying timber. At the upper end of this machine shop is another\r\n  blacksmiths’ shop 130 feet long by 50 feet wide, containing steam\r\n  hammer and drilling machines for special work. A separate building,\r\n  80 feet long by 50 feet, is used for the bending and welding of\r\n  beams, and is so placed that the beams can be lifted direct from\r\n  barges alongside quay, and laid in position, ready for use.\r\n\r\n  The smiths’, fitters’, and other similar shops are all conveniently\r\n  situated; and as the vessels lie alongside the quay to be finished\r\n  off after launching, the minimum of expense in this respect is\r\n  incurred. There are numerous steam cranes of 10 tons and under on\r\n  the quays for landing such portion of the material as comes by\r\n  water, and also to lift articles on board the vessels fitting out.\r\n\r\n  The sawmills, joiners’ shops, mould loft, &c., are situated at\r\n  the lower end of the yard, and the appliances for handling and\r\n  converting timber are most complete. The wood-cutting machinery\r\n  is very extensive, and embraces most of the newest labour-saving\r\n  machines. The establishment in full work employs 2,500 men, and has\r\n  turned out as much as 30,000 tons gross register of shipping in\r\n  a year, including almost every type of vessel for mercantile and\r\n  war purposes, which latter branch of work will now have a further\r\n  development since the amalgamation with the eminent gun-making firm\r\n  of Sir W. G. Armstrong & Co. For this purpose a new yard has been\r\n  laid out at Elswick, adjoining the Ordnance Works, which will be of\r\n  the most complete character.\r\n\r\n  The site of this new yard comprises about 20 acres, and at first\r\n  only half-a-dozen building berths will be laid out, but as the\r\n  frontage is about 2,000 feet, the number of these can be augmented\r\n  as required. The buildings already erected or in progress embrace\r\n  a brick built shop, 265 feet long by 60 feet wide, standing at the\r\n  western portion of the ground, and at right angles to the river.\r\n  This building is in three storeys, the lower portion being intended\r\n  for general stores, tool and rivet stores, fitting shop, &c.; the\r\n  second floor will be entirely used as a joiners’ shop, and fitted\r\n  up in the most complete manner with wood-working machinery of every\r\n  description. The upper floor will be used as a draughting loft and\r\n  model-room. Parallel to this building, and a little distance from\r\n  it, will be a blacksmith’s shop, 150 feet by 50 feet. Adjoining the\r\n  larger building above described, and at right angles to it, is the\r\n  office block, 120 feet by 45 feet. Along the head of the launching\r\n  berths stands a tool shed 420 feet long by 40 feet wide, containing\r\n  the ordinary punching, planing, drilling, and other shipbuilding\r\n  machines, all of the newest and most powerful type. Near the centre\r\n  of the site is a large shed 220 feet long, consisting of four\r\n  bays, each 50 feet wide, the whole carried on cast-iron columns,\r\n  which will comprise the plate and angle furnaces, bending blocks,\r\n  beam shop, angle smiths’ shop, plate rolls, large and small, also\r\n  keel plate bending machine, &c. The yard is served by a complete\r\n  system of railways, having a siding from the North Eastern Railway\r\n  Company’s system. Material can therefore be brought from all parts\r\n  of the kingdom and deposited in any part of the premises.\r\n\r\n  It is almost unnecessary further to give the particulars of\r\n  this establishment, suffice it to say that it is being laid out\r\n  on the experience gained up to date in existing shipyards, and\r\n  will therefore embrace the newest and most important tools in\r\n  all branches of work. The intention is that it shall be capable\r\n  of turning out every description of vessel up to the largest\r\n  iron-clad, and the construction of war vessels of all kinds will\r\n  be made a speciality, seeing that the Company can send them to sea\r\n  completely armed and equipped ready for service. Looking to the\r\n  magnitude of the establishment, it can be regarded as nothing less\r\n  than an arsenal, which in time of war would be invaluable to the\r\n  country. The present and prospective importance of this development\r\n  of the combined firms’ business may be inferred simply from the\r\n  fact of the services of so high an authority as Mr W. H. White,\r\n  late Chief Constructor of the Navy, having been secured as naval\r\n  adviser and manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPTFORD SHIPBUILDING YARD AND REPAIRING DOCKS, SUNDERLAND.\r\n\r\n  These works, established so far back as 1793, but greatly\r\n  transformed and extended to suit modern requirements, are owned\r\n  and presided over by Mr James Laing, son of Mr Philip Laing, their\r\n  founder. The yard consists of two general sections, situated one\r\n  on each side of the main road leading to the river Wear. One of\r\n  these, commonly termed the “Woodyard,” is where wood shipbuilding\r\n  was conducted in the early days, but which now of course, in common\r\n  with the other section, is used exclusively for iron shipbuilding.\r\n  The entire works, including offices, docks, brass foundry, and\r\n  other premises, cover an area of about thirty acres.\r\n\r\n  The yard embraces the various shops and sheds usually pertaining to\r\n  building operations in iron, such as iron-working sheds, smiths’\r\n  shop, joiners’ shop, upholsterers’ shop, bookmakers’ shop, &c.,\r\n  all well equipped with machine-tools and appliances, needful in\r\n  producing vessels for the most important shipping companies. The\r\n  two general sections of the yard are each worked by one compound\r\n  surface condensing engine, all machines being driven by belting\r\n  from main lines of shafting, no independent engines being fitted.\r\n  Scrive-boards, frame furnace, bending blocks, garboard bender,\r\n  and other machinery are fitted in each section. Gorman’s gas\r\n  furnaces are used for heating the material, and these, though\r\n  rather troublesome when first fitted, about twelve years ago, after\r\n  some alterations in the details, now give complete satisfaction,\r\n  and surpass in efficiency ordinary coal furnaces. The joiners’\r\n  shop is situated in the wood-yard, and the smith’s shop in the\r\n  other section. In the smith’s shop a separate engine is provided\r\n  to drive the blast, so that if it is desired the wood-yard can be\r\n  kept completely going without having the main engine in the other\r\n  section at work.\r\n\r\n  The berths of Deptford yard, have been occupied since the\r\n  commencement of iron shipbuilding there, over thirty years ago,\r\n  with vessels for home and foreign shipowners, amongst others for\r\n  such well known companies as the Peninsular and Oriental Company,\r\n  the Union Company, the Royal Mail Company, the West India and\r\n  Pacific Company, the Royal Netherlands Company, and the Hamburg\r\n  and South American Company. In 1882 the _Mexican_, of 4670 tons\r\n  gross measurement, the largest passenger vessel ever built on the\r\n  North-East Coast, and one of the finest of the Union Company’s\r\n  fleet of South African mail steamers, was launched from the stocks\r\n  of Deptford yard. Including the _Mexican_, the following is the\r\n  list of vessels launched by Mr Laing in the year named:—\r\n\r\n          Name.              Material.   Owners.   Gross Tons.\r\n  S.S.

The work presently on hand chiefly\r\n  consists of average size steam vessels, combining cargo-carrying\r\n  powers with high-class accommodation for passengers, several being\r\n  lighted throughout by electricity, and one being constructed of\r\n  steel, and having engines on the triple expansion principle.\r\n\r\n  Connected with the shipbuilding yard there are two graving docks\r\n  of 300 feet and 400 feet in length, one on each side of the river.\r\n  One of these is situated at the west side of the iron yard parallel\r\n  to the building berths, and therefore conveniently placed for\r\n  all kinds of alterations and repairs to vessels. This dock is\r\n  kept dry by means of pumps which act as circulating pumps for the\r\n  condensers of the yard engines. The pumps used for emptying\r\n  this dock, as well as the one on the other side of the river, after\r\n  a vessel has come in, are of the “Pulsometer” type of large size.\r\n  The capacity of these docks is such that in one year alone the\r\n  amount of shipping operated upon, either in the way of repairs,\r\n  alterations, or simple docking, has reached nearly 60,000 tons. A\r\n  large number of vessels have undergone the important process of\r\n  lengthening in these docks—a special and very important branch\r\n  of shipwork in which Mr Laing has been conspicuously successful.\r\n  The largest undertaking of this kind was the lengthening of the\r\n  Peninsular and Oriental Company’s screw-steamer _Poonah_ in 1874\r\n  from a length of 315 feet to that of 395, or an increase of 80\r\n  feet. The work was satisfactorily completed, and the results of\r\n  the vessel’s after-behaviour at sea were communicated, along with\r\n  an account of the work of lengthening, to the Institution of Naval\r\n  Architects by Mr Edwin De Russett, of the Peninsular and Oriental\r\n  Company, in 1877.\r\n\r\n  Adjacent to the shipyard are extensive brass and copper works,\r\n  employing about 300 hands, which, besides supplying all the brass\r\n  and plumber work required for vessels in the shipyard, undertake\r\n  similar work for other shipbuilders, also work for the Navy, such\r\n  as cast gun-metal rams and stern-posts for men-of-war, and brackets\r\n  for outer-bearings in twin-screws. All sorts of steam and other\r\n  fittings—Manchester goods—are also here manufactured and dispersed\r\n  to all parts of the world. Within the same premises are situated\r\n  the requisite machinery for effecting repairs to the engines and\r\n  boilers of vessels overhauled in the docks.\r\n\r\n  At present a large range of new Commercial and Drawing Offices\r\n  are being erected near the principal entrance to the yard. A\r\n  new joiner’s shop and sawmill will shortly be erected, and\r\n  other alterations in the internal economy of the shipyard are\r\n  contemplated. The new range of offices referred to, have a frontage\r\n  of about 300 feet, and comprise strong room for the preservation\r\n  of the firm’s books, drawings, &c.; model-room, 40 feet in length;\r\n  foremen’s room, 40 feet by 30 feet; general office, 42 feet by\r\n  41 feet; private offices for Mr Laing & Sons; drawing office, 45\r\n  feet by 40 feet; moulding loft, 78 feet by 40 feet; model-making\r\n  room, &c. An additional and somewhat noteworthy feature in the\r\n  new buildings will be a large dining hall for the use of those\r\n  workmen who have their meals brought to them at the yard. Also, a\r\n  commodious gymnasium for the benefit of the youth in the employ.\r\n  These are, in addition to the large “British Workman” already in\r\n  existence, built by Mr Laing for the use of his employés, and\r\n  for others who care to subscribe. This institution, comprising\r\n  dining room, game rooms, smoking room and library, is managed by a\r\n  committee of the employés, and is self-supporting, a contribution\r\n  of only one half-penny per week being the qualification for\r\n  membership, admitting subscriber to all the benefits of the\r\n  institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WORKS OF THE BARROW SHIPBUILDING COMPANY (LIMITED).\r\n\r\n  The Barrow Shipbuilding Company, Limited, was promoted in 1876 by\r\n  several gentlemen in Barrow connected with the Furness Railway,\r\n  the Docks, and Steel Works, chief among whom was Mr Ramsden (now\r\n  Sir James Ramsden) then managing director of the Furness Railway,\r\n  Mayor of Barrow, and leading spirit in its development generally.\r\n  The Duke of Devonshire, the largest proprietor in the district and\r\n  in the other public works mentioned, became the largest shareholder\r\n  and the chairman of the new shipbuilding company, which was then\r\n  formally constituted, with Mr Robert Duncan, shipbuilder of\r\n  Port-Glasgow, as managing director. Mr Duncan designed the whole\r\n  arrangement of the works as they now stand, and continued to act as\r\n  managing director till 1875, when he resigned, and was succeeded\r\n  by Sir James Ramsden, with Mr James Humphreys as manager, which\r\n  position the latter held till 1880, when he was succeeded by Mr\r\n  William John, of Lloyd’s Register, to whose talent as a naval\r\n  architect some tribute has been elsewhere passed in this work.\r\n\r\n  The total area of the plot of land on which these works stand\r\n  is 58 acres, with two water frontages, each 1050 feet long, one\r\n  towards Walney Channel, into which the ships are launched, the\r\n  other towards the docks where the ships are fitted out. The\r\n  Walney Channel is sufficiently wide to allow of the launching of\r\n  the largest vessels without risk, and the site is altogether an\r\n  exceptionably favourable one. The shipbuilding is carried on in\r\n  that part of the yard adjoining the Walney Channel, being divided\r\n  from the engine works by a road, under which is a sub-way, which\r\n  affords the required communication between the two departments.\r\n\r\n  Entering the shipbuilding department by the main gate-way in\r\n  this dividing road the visitor finds himself in a large square,\r\n  formed by substantial buildings; to the left hand on entering,\r\n  are the offices, and to the right some of the smaller shops. The\r\n  opposite side of the square is occupied by the machine shed and\r\n  smiths’ shops, whilst on the right-hand side of the square are\r\n  the frame-bending shed, and on the left the joiners’ shop and the\r\n  sawmill. Passing through the offices upstairs, the visitor enters\r\n  a very fine drawing office and model-room, 100 feet by 50 feet, in\r\n  which an efficient staff of designers are engaged. On the ground\r\n  floor are the counting-house, officials’ rooms, &c., and beyond\r\n  these the stores for the supply of everything required in building\r\n  and outfitting ships and machinery. From the stores, or by the\r\n  outside square, the moulding loft, 250 feet by 50 feet, is reached,\r\n  of which the joiners’ shop is a continuation. This department is\r\n  300 feet long by 60 feet wide, and is fitted with every modern\r\n  appliance in the way of tools to facilitate work. At the back of\r\n  this shop is an immense room, 600 ft. by 60 ft., occupied by a\r\n  sawmill, and used also for spar-making, boat-building, and rigging.\r\n  Above these rooms, in continuation of the drawing office and\r\n  model-room, from which it may be entered, is the cabinet-making\r\n  department, which necessarily requires a large amount of space in\r\n  an establishment where passenger and emigrant ships of the largest\r\n  types are equipped ready for sea. The iron-working machine shed,\r\n  360 ft. by 100 ft., and the frame-bending shed, 300 ft. by 180\r\n  ft., follow in order, occupying the whole of one, and most of the\r\n  other side of the square above described. Both of these sections\r\n  are fully equipped with the machinery necessary for the rapid\r\n  manipulation of material. The smiths’ shop, 200 ft. by 120 ft.,\r\n  contains one hundred fires and seven steam hammers, the former\r\n  being blown by a Schiele fan. Attached to the smiths’ shop are\r\n  shops for fitting smith-work and for galvanizing. All these shops\r\n  and sheds occupy less than one-third of the ground devoted to the\r\n  shipbuilding department.\r\n\r\n  Beyond the machine shop are the slip-ways, twelve in number, where\r\n  vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 40,000 tons have frequently\r\n  been seen at one time in various stages of construction. On these\r\n  slip-ways have been built the well-known mail steamer _City of\r\n  Rome_ and the steamship _Normandie_, the largest vessel of the\r\n  French mail service. Here also were built for the Anchor Line the\r\n  _Anchoria_, the _Devonia_, the _Circassia_, and the _Furnessia_;\r\n  for the Ducal Line, the _Duke of Devonshire_, the _Duke of\r\n  Buccleuch_, the _Duke of Lancaster_, the _Duke of Buckingham_, and\r\n  the _Duke of Westminster_. From these slip-ways also emanated the\r\n  _Ganges_ and the _Sutlej_ for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam\r\n  Navigation Company as well as the _Eden_ and the _Esk_ for the\r\n  Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. For the Isle of Man Steam Packet\r\n  Company, the _Ben my Chree_, the _Fenella_, and the _Peveril_.\r\n  For the Société Anonyme de Navigation Belge Américaine, the\r\n  s.s. _Belgenland_ and _Rhyhland_. For the Castle Line, the s.s.\r\n  _Pembroke Castle_, and for the Société Générale de Transports\r\n  Maritimes à Vapeur of Marseilles, the s.s. _Navarre_ and _Bearn_.\r\n  Here were also produced the _Kow Shing_ for the Indo-China Steam\r\n  Navigation Company, and the _Takapuna_ for the Union Steamship\r\n  Company of New Zealand, besides many other vessels well known\r\n  to the mercantile world. For the Admiralty this yard has turned\r\n  out seven gun-boats, namely, the _Foxhound_, the _Forward_, the\r\n  _Grappler_, the _Wrangler_, the _Wasp_, the _Banterer_, and the\r\n  _Espoir_, as well as four torpedo mooring ships.\r\n\r\n  Leaving the shipbuilding department, the visitor passes through\r\n  the afore-mentioned sub-way to the engine works, which occupies an\r\n  area of ground equal to that of the shipyard proper. To the left\r\n  may be noticed the coppersmith’s shop, the brass foundry, and the\r\n  engineer’s smithy. The Foundry has seven ordinary pot furnaces, and\r\n  one large reverberatory air furnace for castings of the heaviest\r\n  class. The smithy is well fitted up with hammers suitable for the\r\n  work. On the opposite side of the ground are two buildings, the\r\n  one to the left containing the iron foundry and boiler shop. The\r\n  foundry, 250 ft. by 150 ft., provided with overhead travellers,\r\n  is capable of turning out the largest castings required for the\r\n  monster marine engines of the present day. The boiler shop is\r\n  the same size, and possesses the most modern contrivances for\r\n  the skilful and economical execution of work, and it contains a\r\n  complete equipment of hydraulic riveting machines, both fixed and\r\n  portable, the largest having a gap of 10 feet and a pressure of\r\n  90-lbs.\r\n\r\n  In the space between the boiler shop and the machine shop there\r\n  are situated a well-arranged furnace for heating, and the vertical\r\n  rolls for bending the large plates forming the shells of the marine\r\n  boilers. In the furnace just mentioned the plates are heated\r\n  while standing on their edge, and as the top of the furnace is\r\n  level with the ground, they are readily lifted out by a portable\r\n  crane and deposited on the bed-plate adjoining the vertical\r\n  rolls. In this vacant space is also situated the water tower for\r\n  the accumulator for the 100-ton crane, constructed by Sir Wm. G.\r\n  Armstrong and erected at the side of the Devonshire Dock, where the\r\n  machinery is placed on board and fixed for new ships.\r\n\r\n  The engine shop, although 420 ft. long by 100 ft. wide, is scarcely\r\n  large enough for the pressure of work oftentimes concentrated\r\n  there. This shop is unsurpassed in the completeness of its fittings\r\n  and the perfection of its tools. It, like most of the other shops\r\n  in the establishment, is fitted up with the electric light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing descriptive notes of individual yards may fittingly\r\nbe supplemented by the following table, which shows the number and\r\nrelative positions of firms throughout all the districts whose total\r\noutput of tonnage during the year 1883 exceeded 20,000 tons:—\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+-------------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |          Firm’s Name.        |  District.  | Number of |  Gross  |\r\n  |                              |             |  Vessels. | Tonnage.|\r\n  +------------------------------+-------------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |  1.

What may\r\nnow fairly be considered the great centres of shipbuilding are the\r\nvalleys of the Clyde, Tyne, Wear, and Tees, and also the Thames and\r\nMersey, although these latter rivers have for a considerable number\r\nof years been overshadowed as building centres by the immensity of\r\ntheir shipping. In several other districts, of course, shipbuilding\r\nis carried on to a considerable extent, and some of these may\r\nyet attain much greater importance than they at present possess.\r\nBarrow-in-Furness, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of recent\r\nyears, is still advancing. Belfast occupies a prominent position, not\r\nalone because of the large annual output of tonnage, but by reason\r\nof the number of high-class ocean steamships which have been, and\r\ncontinue to be, built there. Dundee, Leith, Hull, Southampton, and\r\nother places throughout the United Kingdom, are not without claims to\r\nrecognition on account of the shipbuilding carried on.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of one shipbuilding centre over another in the matter\r\nof work accomplished, both with regard to its character and its\r\nquantity, not infrequently forms the subject of comment in the\r\ncolumns of journals circulating in the districts concerned. The\r\npublication, by these journals, at the close of each year, of the\r\nreturns of new tonnage produced by the various firms, affords an\r\nopportunity for vaunting on such matters, and it is, as a rule, taken\r\nadvantage of by the compilers of the statements, who are usually\r\nmembers of the staff on the journals in question. These statements,\r\nthrough the interesting nature of the statistics they contain, are\r\nwidely read, and the labour attaching to their preparation must\r\nindeed be considerable. The figures are, as a rule, supplied by\r\nthe shipbuilders themselves, and from a summation of these the\r\ncompiler draws his conclusions. The accuracy of the returns and the\r\nfairness of the comments based upon them, if not always completely\r\nsatisfactory, are thus seen to be matters for which the compiler is\r\nnot wholly responsible.\r\n\r\nFrequent exception has been taken by correspondents to discrepancies\r\nin the tonnages of individual vessels given in these reports, as\r\ncompared with the tonnages measured by the Board of Trade officials,\r\nand entered in their records. Attention was called to this matter\r\nat the close of 1883 by a correspondent in _Engineering_, whose\r\nassertions were afterwards corroborated in other journals. From\r\na careful checking of the returns made by the Glasgow press of\r\nthe shipbuilding on the Clyde for the three previous years this\r\ncorrespondent maintained that the aggregate tonnage was overstated\r\nto the extent of about 11,000 per year, or over 34,100 tons for the\r\nperiod named. One very gross instance of the misstatement complained\r\nof was given by a second correspondent writing to the _Glasgow\r\nHerald_, who drew attention, along with the returns of other firms,\r\nto that of a firm building the smaller class of vessels, who were\r\nstated in the _Herald’s_ account to have produced 8,300 tons, when\r\nby a careful comparison with the actual tonnages of the vessels as\r\nrecorded in Lloyd’s Register, their total output was found to fall\r\nshort of the figure given by as much as 2,172 tons, equivalent to 35\r\nper cent. of the actual output. In commenting on these discrepancies\r\nseveral obvious considerations suggested themselves to the critics:\r\nsuch as possible misapprehension, caused by the existence of several\r\nkinds of “tonnages,” and the difficulty of stating accurately the\r\ntonnages of vessels recently launched. It was questioned, however,\r\nafter all such allowances were made, whether those furnishing the\r\nfigures could be exonerated from the sin of carelessness, or indeed,\r\nof pure falsification with the view of figuring prominently in the\r\nlist. The accuracy of these criticisms has not in any way been\r\ndisproved, nor has any satisfactory explanation been offered.\r\n\r\nWhile no attempt will here be made to solve the matter, it has been\r\nfelt that, in justice to the subject, these charges could not be\r\nignored when presenting statistics which are derived mainly from the\r\nsources thus challenged. Indeed, in comparing for the present work\r\nthe statistics given by various journals—even in journals confined\r\nto the same district—innumerable disparities have been met with, and\r\nthe agreement has only been _en grosse_. Such being the case, it may\r\nbe asked, could not other and more reliable sources be consulted?\r\nThe obvious alternative of using the authoritative returns of the\r\nBoard of Trade, or of Lloyd’s Register, at once suggests itself, but\r\nobjections to this are even more serious than to using the press\r\nstatistics. The returns issued annually by the Board of Trade only\r\nrelate to “Merchant Shipping” registered as such, whereas it is well\r\nknown that in the returns furnished by the shipbuilders all sorts\r\nof vessels built by them are included, and that a very considerable\r\ntonnage in war vessels and small vessels for military purposes, also\r\nin light-draught river craft, both for our own and other countries,\r\nis annually turned out from merchant shipyards. The same objections\r\napply to Lloyd’s Register Summary, although, strangely enough, the\r\nfigures there more nearly correspond with the builders’ than with the\r\nBoard of Trade returns, the information given in both cases being the\r\ngross tonnage of merchant shipping built and registered in the United\r\nKingdom. Everything considered, the statistics compiled from press\r\nreturns more accurately represent the work accomplished throughout\r\nthe districts than those afforded by any of the sources named. In\r\nthe statistics which follow, therefore, the press returns have been\r\nadopted, but to simplify matters for purposes of comparison—the\r\ndegree of unreliability warranting it—the terminal figures in large\r\nquantities have been reduced or increased to hundredths, according\r\nas they have chanced to be under or above fifty.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuation from year to year in the shipbuilding industry of\r\nthe principal districts over an extended period is exhibited in an\r\ninteresting manner by the diagram facing page 188, consisting of\r\ncurves set up on equidistant ordinates representing years, to the\r\nscale shown on the right of the diagram. The figures from which\r\nthe curves have been constructed will be found to the left of the\r\ndiagram.[32]\r\n\r\nIt is matter of considerable regret to the author that his utmost\r\nefforts to obtain statistics for the Tyne over a period corresponding\r\nto that for which the Clyde figures are available have not been\r\nrewarded with success. Many likely sources have been consulted, and\r\nseveral gentlemen connected with the river and its industries have\r\nbeen appealed to, but without any satisfactory result. No systematic\r\nrecord of shipbuilding output has been kept by anyone officially\r\nconcerned with the river, although in every other respect its\r\nprogress has been abundantly and accurately chronicled. It is only so\r\nrecently as 1878 that the _Newcastle Chronicle_ begun the practice\r\nof giving, in the systematic and complete manner for which it is now\r\njustly noted, the returns of shipbuilding throughout the Kingdom. To\r\nthis journal the author is indebted for the figures of work done on\r\nthe Tyne during the years subsequent to 1878. The figures for the\r\nWear have been taken from an article descriptive of that district\r\nappearing in the _Shipping World_ for June of the present year.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Clyde, it is interesting to observe how in the\r\ncurve the periods of greatest activity, and consequent output, are\r\nrecurrent every tenth year. Thus at 1864, 1874, and, at all events,\r\n1883, the curve forms decided crests as compared with the general\r\nundulations over the intervening years.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years from 1846 to 1852 inclusive the number of\r\nsteam vessels built on the Clyde amounted to 14 with wood hulls,\r\n233 with iron hulls—total, 247, of which 141 were paddle-steamers\r\nand 106 screw-steamers. The tonnage of the wooden steamers amounted\r\nto 18,330, and of the iron vessels to 129,270 tons; the horse-power\r\nof the engines in the wooden hulls being 6,740, and in the iron\r\nhulls 31,590. In 1851, or nearly a decade earlier than the year\r\nat which the curve begins, the number of ships produced was 41,\r\nwith an aggregate tonnage of 25,320. In 1861, a decade later, 81\r\nsteamers were built, the tonnage of which amounted to 60,185, and the\r\nhorse-power of the engines, 12,493. The tonnage for both steamers\r\nand ships, however, during that year was 66,800, as shown by the\r\ndiagram. During the seven years immediately prior to 1862 the extent\r\nand progress of shipbuilding on the river were such that 636 vessels,\r\nhaving an aggregate tonnage of 377,000 tons, were launched from the\r\nyards of Glasgow, Greenock, and Dumbarton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONNAGE DIAGRAM.\r\n\r\nCURVES SHOWING THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE TONNAGE OF NEW SHIPPING PRODUCED\r\nIN THE PRINCIPAL SHIPBUILDING DISTRICTS SINCE 1860.]\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------+\r\n  |       TABLE OF YEARLY TONNAGE       |\r\n  +-------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  | YEARS |  CLYDE  |  TYNE   |  WEAR   |\r\n  |       | TON’AGE | TON’AGE | TON’AGE |\r\n  +-------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |  1860 |  47,800 |         |  40,200 |\r\n  |  1861 |  66,800 |         |  46,800 |\r\n  |  1862 |  69,900 |         |  56,900 |\r\n  |  1863 | 123,300 |         |  70,000 |\r\n  |  1864 | 178,500 |         |  72,000 |\r\n  |  1865 | 154,000 |         |  73,100 |\r\n  |  1866 | 124,500 |         |  62,700 |\r\n  |  1867 | 108,000 |         |  52,200 |\r\n  |  1868 | 169,600 |         |  70,300 |\r\n  |  1869 | 192,300 |         |  72,400 |\r\n  |  1870 | 180,400 |         |  70,100 |\r\n  |  1871 | 196,300 |         |  81,900 |\r\n  |  1872 | 230,300 |         | 131,800 |\r\n  |  1873 | 232,900 |         |  99,400 |\r\n  |  1874 | 262,400 |         |  88,000 |\r\n  |  1875 | 211,800 |         |  79,900 |\r\n  |  1876 | 174,800 |         |  54,100 |\r\n  |  1877 | 169,700 |         |  87,600 |\r\n  |  1878 | 222,300 | 126,300 | 109,900 |\r\n  |  1879 | 174,800 | 139,800 |  92,200 |\r\n  |  1880 | 248,700 | 149,100 | 116,200 |\r\n  |  1881 | 341,000 | 177,200 | 148,000 |\r\n  |  1882 | 391,900 | 208,400 | 212,500 |\r\n  |  1883 | 419,600 | 216,600 | 212,300 |\r\n  +-------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nWith the year just spoken of a first and very considerable rise in\r\nthe tonnage output set in and continued till the year 1864, in which\r\nyear it amounted to 178,500 tons. Various causes of an exceptional\r\nnature, or at least, causes apart from the natural progress due\r\nto the growth of shipping, were at work in bringing about this\r\nincrease in the output. The most prominent of these was the necessity\r\nwhich arose for filling up the gaps produced by the withdrawal of\r\nmany swift steamers from the river and coasting trade to meet the\r\nrequirements of individuals interested in running the blockade of\r\nthe ports of the Southern States of America. Between Aprils 1862-3\r\nalone, as many as 30 vessels actively connected in some way with\r\nthe Clyde and coasting service, were sold for that purpose, and the\r\nreplacement of these vessels went a considerable way in occasioning\r\nthe briskness. Another and more abiding cause, however, was the\r\ndemand for vessels for the cotton-carrying trade. This arose chiefly\r\nfrom the blockade of the American ports, causing cotton to come right\r\nfrom the East Indies and China; and in consequence of the longer\r\nvoyage many more ships were necessary to carry on the trade. The fact\r\nthat more than an average number of wrecks had occurred during the\r\ntwo previous winters, together with an increase of the trade between\r\nBritain and France as the result of Mr Cobden’s commercial treaty,\r\nwere elements lending impetus to the briskness in the shipbuilding of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the output of tonnage was lessened considerably through\r\nwhat appears to have been but the natural course of commerce in\r\nits reactionary stage. This lessened activity was much aggravated\r\nwhen 1866 was reached, and in that year a serious interruption to\r\nthe trade was caused by a lock-out of the workmen consequent on a\r\npartial strike made to enforce what the employers considered an\r\nunreasonable demand on the part of the men. In 1867 the output was\r\nas low as 108,000 tons, but thereafter it took an upward tendency,\r\nits rise to the previous level being sudden, but thereafter very\r\ngradual, and spread over a number of years. The output kept steadily\r\nimproving each year, outreaching former totals, until in 1874 the\r\ncurve, or, as it may be called, the output wave, formed a crest of\r\nexceptional altitude. For that year the aggregate output reached\r\nthe unprecedented figure of 262,430 tons, a result which made\r\nnatural all subsequent references to 1874 as the “big year.” The\r\nyear 1875, although showing an increase in the number of vessels\r\nbuilt, yet fell considerably short of 1874 in the matter of tonnage,\r\nthus giving to the output curve a decided downward turn. Matters\r\ncontinued to grow worse during 1876, and many of the Clyde firms\r\nhad painful experiences of “bare poles” until about the beginning\r\nof the year 1877, when a slightly improved state of matters set in.\r\nThen there was a general desire amongst the workmen for an advance\r\nin wages, which ultimately resulted in the great shipwright strike\r\nof midsummer, 1877. This strike, it may be remembered, lasted\r\ntwenty-four weeks, and was one of the most determined struggles which\r\never took place in this country, both parties having evidently made\r\nup their minds to hold out to the last. The strike culminated in the\r\ngeneral lock-out of workmen in the autumn of the same year, which,\r\nwhen withdrawn in favour of arbitration as regards the shipwrights,\r\nsettled down into a keen fight with the ironworkers. The shipwrights’\r\nclaim was settled by arbitration, the umpire (Lord Moncrieff)\r\ndeciding in favour of the employers, and the men accordingly resumed\r\nwork. The ironworkers’ dispute was likewise a difficult matter to\r\ndecide, but ultimately the men resumed work on the understanding that\r\ntheir claim for an advance upon their wages of 10 per cent. would be\r\nconsidered six months subsequently. The struggles were exceedingly\r\ncostly alike to masters and workmen, one of the results being seen\r\npretty distinctly in the diminished output of tonnage during 1877.\r\n\r\nAbout the spring of 1878 matters had not improved in any very\r\nmaterial sense; and the ironworkers insisting on a settlement of\r\ntheir former claim for an advance, were met by the employers with a\r\nproposal to increase the working hours from 51 per week, as arranged\r\nin 1872, to 54 hours per week, or to reduce the then rate of wages.\r\nThe men were not unnaturally averse to the increase of working hours,\r\nand signified their opposition. Subsequently a reduction in wages\r\nof 7½ per cent. was enforced, with the result that the ironworkers\r\ncame out on strike for a time. Ultimately in the spring of 1879 a\r\nreturn to the 54 hours was made. The prevailing great depression\r\ncontinued well on into the autumn of 1879. In October of that year\r\nthe shipbuilding industry experienced an unexpected but very welcome\r\nrevival, and an unusually large amount of work came to the Clyde.\r\nThe output which in 1879 had fallen to 174,800 tons, now took a\r\nsudden and remarkable jump, the figure for 1880 amounting to no\r\nless than 248,650 tons, affording ample grounds for the belief that\r\nthe impetus at the close of 1879 was no mere temporary spurt, but a\r\nsolid revival. Subsequent experience has more than justified this\r\nbelief. In 1881 the output reached the aggregate of 341,000 tons,\r\nin 1882 it overstepped even this, and the output curve continued\r\nin the ascendant until for the year 1883 the stupendous aggregate\r\nof 419,600 tons was reached. Following the course which accepted\r\ntheories regarding industrial activity and depression suggest, and\r\nwhich actual experience in the past exemplifies, the curve of output\r\nought still to be in the ascendant, reaching its maximum in 1884, and\r\nthereafter declining. Although the close of the year is still some\r\ndistance off, there is already ample reason to believe that this will\r\nnot hold good for 1884. This result is after all only very natural\r\nwhen the most exceptional activity of the past four years, coupled\r\nwith the present very unhealthy state of the shipping trade, are\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of iron shipbuilding on the North-East Coast district\r\ndoes not commence until the year 1840. In March of that year the\r\n_John Garrow_, of Liverpool, a vessel of 800 tons burthen, the first\r\niron ship seen in the North-East Coast rivers, arrived at Shields,\r\nand caused considerable excitement. A shipbuilding firm at Walker\r\ncommenced to use the new material almost immediately, and on the 23rd\r\nof September, 1842, the iron steamer _Prince Albert_ glided from\r\nWalker Slipway into the waters of the Tyne.\r\n\r\nDuring the next eight or ten years very little progress was made, the\r\nvessels mostly in demand being colliers, in the construction of which\r\nno one thought of applying iron. About the year 1850, the carriage of\r\ncoal by railway began seriously to affect the sale of north country\r\ncoal in the London market, and it became essential, in the interest\r\nof the coal-owners and others, to devise some means of conveying the\r\nstaple produce of the North Country to London in an expeditious,\r\nregular, and, at the same time, economical manner. To accomplish this\r\nobject, Mr C. M. Palmer caused an iron screw-steamer to be designed\r\nin such a manner as to secure the greatest possible capacity, with\r\nengines only sufficiently powerful to ensure her making her voyages\r\nwith regularity. This vessel (the _John Bowes_), the first screw\r\ncollier, was built to carry 650 tons, and to steam about nine\r\nmiles an hour. On her first voyage, she was laden with 650 tons of\r\ncoals in four hours; in forty-eight hours she arrived in London;\r\nin twenty-four hours she discharged her cargo; and in forty-eight\r\nhours more she was again in the Tyne; so that, in five days, she\r\nperformed successfully an amount of work that would have taken two\r\naverage-sized sailing colliers upwards of a month to accomplish. To\r\nthe success of this experiment may be attributed, in great measure,\r\nthe subsequent and rapid development of iron shipbuilding in the\r\nTyne and East Coast district. The district has maintained by far the\r\nlargest share—almost amounting to a monopoly—in the production of the\r\nheavy-carrying, slow-speed type of cargo steamers, of which the _John\r\nBowes_ may be said to have been the prototype.\r\n\r\nStatistics for the Tyne, as already explained, are not available to\r\nany extent until within recent years,[33] but from a paper on “The\r\nConstruction of Iron Ships and the Progress of Iron Shipbuilding on\r\nthe Tyne, Wear, and Tees,” written by Mr C. M. Palmer, and forming\r\npart of the work, “The Industrial Resources of the Tyne, Wear, and\r\nTees,” published in connection with the British Association’s visit\r\nto Newcastle in 1863, it appears that the tonnage of iron ships\r\nlaunched from the Tyne during 1862 amounted to 32,175 tons, and\r\nduring 1863, to 51,236 tons. Comparing this with the output for\r\n1883—twenty years later—it is found that the figures are more than\r\nquadrupled, for in that year the output of the Tyne reached as much\r\nas 216,600 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the year following the launch of the _John Bowes_, namely,\r\nin 1853, the first iron vessel built on the Wear, was released\r\nfrom its blocks. The Tees followed the example with great energy\r\nand considerable success, and on both these rivers trade in iron\r\nshipbuilding has been correspondingly developed.\r\n\r\nWhat may be described, however, as the opening of the age of iron\r\non the Wear did not begin till the year 1863. During that year\r\n17,720 tons of iron shipping were launched, and from that time the\r\ndeclension of wood shipbuilding, which had long made the Wear a\r\ndistinguished shipbuilding port in the United Kingdom, proceeded\r\napace. The causes of fluctuation in the trade throughout the\r\nsubsequent years cannot be traced with any circumstantiality, but\r\nthe general progress made can be readily gathered from the subjoined\r\ntabular record of the number of ships built yearly, with their\r\naggregate and average tonnage. Wood vessels, it may be stated, formed\r\npart of the aggregate till the year 1878, when wood dropped out of\r\nthe arena altogether:—\r\n\r\n  +-------+--------+-------------+---------+\r\n  |       |   No.  |             |         |\r\n  | Year. |   of   | Gross Tons. | Average |\r\n  |       | Ships. |             |  Tons.  |\r\n  +-------+--------+-------------+---------+\r\n  | 1860  |   112  |   40,200    |   359   |\r\n  | 1861  |   126  |   46,778    |   371   |\r\n  | 1862  |   160  |   56,920    |   356   |\r\n  | 1863  |   171  |   70,040    |   410   |\r\n  | 1864  |   153  |   71,987    |   470   |\r\n  | 1865  |   172  |   73,134    |   425   |\r\n  | 1866  |   145  |   62,719    |   432   |\r\n  | 1867  |   128  |   52,249    |   408   |\r\n  | 1868  |   138  |   70,302    |   510   |\r\n  | 1869  |   122  |   72,420    |   594   |\r\n  | 1870  |   103  |   70,084    |   681   |\r\n  | 1871  |    97  |   81,903    |   844   |\r\n  | 1872  |   122  |  131,825    |  1081   |\r\n  | 1873  |    95  |   99,371    |  1046   |\r\n  | 1874  |    88  |   88,022    |  1000   |\r\n  | 1875  |    91  |   79,904    |   878   |\r\n  | 1876  |    60  |   54,041    |   901   |\r\n  | 1877  |    75  |   87,578    |  1168   |\r\n  | 1878  |    85  |  109,900    |  1293   |\r\n  | 1879  |    65  |   92,200    |  1418   |\r\n  | 1880  |    77  |  116,200    |  1509   |\r\n  | 1881  |    88  |  148,000    |  1681   |\r\n  | 1882  |   123  |  212,500    |  1727   |\r\n  | 1883  |   126  |  212,300    |  1685   |\r\n  +-------+--------+-------------+---------+\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1871, 1872, and 1873 the output from the Clyde yards\r\naveraged 50 per cent. of the total shipping produced throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom. That high proportion fell for the years 1874, 1875,\r\nand 1876 to as low as 37½ per cent. In 1882 the Clyde’s contribution\r\nto the grand total did not exceed 32½ per cent., so that in one\r\ndecade the premier shipbuilding centre has fallen from the proud\r\nposition of producing half the total shipping built within the United\r\nKingdom to that of turning out less than one-third. Mr William\r\nDenny, dealing with this subject in a paper on the “Industries of\r\nScotland,” read before the Philosophical Society of Dumbarton, in\r\nDecember, 1878, attributed the then condition of affairs with regard\r\nto the tonnage output of the Clyde to the keen competition of the\r\nbuilders on the North-East Coast of England, who managed to produce\r\ntheir favourite type of heavy-carrying, slow-speed steamers at very\r\nmuch less cost than could be done on the Clyde. Their success in this\r\nhe attributed to four causes—1st, to the enterprise of the small\r\nshipowners and the general public on the North-East Coast of England\r\nin supplying capital for steamers of this kind; 2nd, to the great\r\ncheapness of iron in that district; 3rd, to the long hours worked,\r\nenabling the shipbuilding plant to be more profitably employed, and\r\nto the great development of piece-work; 4th, to the fact that all\r\nthe builders being engaged upon work of the same class, the price of\r\nwhich could be measured per ton of dead-weight carried, or per ton\r\ngross, and per nominal horse-power, they were able easily to compare\r\nthe efficiency of each other’s yard in point of production, and by\r\nthat means a keen competition was produced amongst each other. On the\r\nClyde the great variety and frequent speciality of the work prevented\r\nany such common measure of prices existing. This way of accounting\r\nfor the altered relative positions of the chief shipbuilding centres\r\nwas doubtless at that time the correct one, and to a large extent it\r\nstill holds true. The productiveness of the North-East Coast ports\r\nhas in no way declined since, notwithstanding that a larger number\r\nof the higher class passenger ships which have long been so much a\r\nClyde speciality are now being constructed there. But the number of\r\nyards everywhere have increased in a higher ratio than on the Clyde,\r\nand consequently the aggregate of new shipping produced annually\r\nin the United Kingdom is made up of a greater number of separate\r\ncontributions. That this is mainly the reason of the present position\r\nof the Clyde relatively to the whole United Kingdom is proved by the\r\nfigures contained in the accompanying table, which show, amongst\r\nother things, that the ratio of tonnage produced by each of the\r\nprincipal districts to the total produced by the whole of them, has\r\nnot very much altered during the past six years, or since Mr Denny\r\nspoke on the subject. If anything, indeed, the Clyde shows in this\r\nrespect an advance over its northern rivals: although the advance of\r\nthe Wear during the past two years is equally marked.\r\n\r\n  _Table giving the Number and Tonnage of Vessels Built on the Clyde,\r\n  Tyne, Wear, and Tees, during the Years 1878-83 inclusive; also\r\n  showing the Average Tonnage of the Vessels and the Ratio which the\r\n  Tonnage produced in each District bears to the Total Tonnage_:\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------------------------++----------------------------+\r\n  |          |            1878.           ||            1879.           |\r\n  |          +----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Districts.|    |        |Av’rage|Ratio ||    |        |Av’rage|Ratio |\r\n  |          | No.|  Tons. |Ton’ge.| to   || No.|  Tons. |Ton’ge.| to   |\r\n  |          |    |        |       |Total.||    |        |       |Total.|\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Clyde     | 254| 222,300|   875 | 43·5 || 191| 174,800|   915 |  39·8|\r\n  |Tyne      | 115| 126,300|  1096 | 24·7 || 130| 139,800|  1075 |  32·0|\r\n  |Wear      |  85| 109,900|  1293 | 21·5 ||  65|  92,200|  1418 |  21·0|\r\n  |Tees      |  37|  52,500|  1419 | 10·3 ||  25|  31,800|  1272 |   7·2|\r\n  |          +----+--------+       +------++----+--------+       +------+\r\n  |Totals    | 491| 511,000|       |100·0 || 411| 438,600|       | 100·0|\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Districts.|            1880.           ||            1881.           |\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Clyde     | 209| 248,700|  1189 | 44·2 || 261| 341,000|  1306 |  47·0|\r\n  |Tyne      | 109| 149,100|  1367 | 26·5 || 123| 177,200|  1440 |  24·5|\r\n  |Wear      |  77| 116,200|  1509 | 20·6 ||  88| 148,000|  1681 |  20·4|\r\n  |Tees      |  38|  48,500|  1279 |  8·7 ||  34|  58,600|  1723 |   8·1|\r\n  |          +----+--------+       +------++----+--------+       +------+\r\n  |Totals    | 433| 562,500|       |100·0 || 506| 724,800|       | 100·0|\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Districts.|            1882.           ||            1883.           |\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n  |Clyde     | 297| 391,900|  1319 | 44·6 || 329| 419,700|  1276 |  45·1|\r\n  |Tyne      | 132| 208,400|  1578 | 23·8 || 159| 216,600|  1362 |  23·3|\r\n  |Wear      | 123| 212,500|  1727 | 24·2 || 126| 212,300|  1685 |  23·0|\r\n  |Tees      |  40|  65,000|  1625 |  7·4 ||  44|  81,800|  1859 |   8·6|\r\n  +----------+----+--------+       +------++----+--------+       +------+\r\n  |Totals    | 592| 877,800|       |100·0 || 658| 930,400|       | 100·0|\r\n  +----------+----+--------+-------+------++----+--------+-------+------+\r\n\r\nWith respect to the progress of shipbuilding in steel, little\r\nrequires to be added to the general account given in Chapter I.\r\nThe tonnage annually produced in steel is a constantly-increasing\r\nquantity. Hitherto the Clyde has contributed quite three-fourths of\r\nthe tonnage of steel vessels, owing chiefly to the vigorous way in\r\nwhich certain of the shipbuilders there have adopted the practice,\r\nand also to the openness of the local field for the extensive\r\nmanufacture of the new material. The North-East Coast, however, bids\r\nfair, in the immediate future, to become as productive in steel\r\ntonnage as the Clyde district. Recently-discovered processes by\r\nwhich the vast stores of Cleveland ironstone may be made profitably\r\navailable in steel manufacture are working great changes in the way\r\nof modifying old and causing the erection of new works.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary growth of steel shipbuilding since its commencement\r\nin 1878 is well illustrated by the accompanying tables, which are\r\ntaken from a paper by Mr W. John, on “Recent Improvements in Iron\r\nand Steel Shipbuilding,” read at the meetings of the Iron and Steel\r\nInstitute in May of the present year. The figures relating to steel\r\nmay be taken, where any divergence occurs, as more authoritative\r\nthan those occurring in the general account of work in steel in\r\nChapter I. The tables, however, partake of the imperfections already\r\nfully alluded to in the present chapter. With regard to them, Mr\r\nJohn says:—“Unfortunately, neither of these tables show the actual\r\namount of shipping, either steel or iron, built in this country,\r\nbecause there would have to be a small percentage, perhaps between\r\nten and twenty, to be added to those classed at Lloyds on Table I.\r\nfor unclassed ships, and there would be a certain proportion, which\r\nI am unable to ascertain, to be added to the figures on Table II.\r\nfor ships built for foreign owners in this country, and not entered\r\nupon the British register. However, the figures in themselves are\r\nsufficiently significant of the enormous growth of steel shipbuilding\r\nwithin the last six years, and it will be seen at once, as I\r\nhave said before, that steel as a material for shipbuilding has\r\npassed entirely out of the experimental stage, and must be judged\r\nhenceforth by the results of its working in the shipyards, and by\r\nthe results of the performances of the ships already afloat, both\r\nas profit-earning machines for their owners, by their general wear\r\nand tear, for their safety against strains at sea, and in cases of\r\ncollision and stranding.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table I.—Statement showing the Number and Tonnage of Steel and Iron\r\nVessels Classed by Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign Shipping\r\nduring the

STEAMSHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the enormous aggregates, no feature of the annual output\r\nof new tonnage during recent years has been more remarkable than the\r\ngreat number of full-powered and capacious steamships built for the\r\nvarious ocean-trading companies. The very general interest with which\r\nwhat has been termed “the race for big ships” was regarded two or\r\nthree years ago has now settled down into the complacent indifference\r\nwith which matter-of-fact, every-day things are treated. The number\r\nof vessels above 4000 tons gross register built during the year 1881\r\nalone was over two-thirds of the whole number produced during the\r\nten years immediately preceding, and was exactly double the number\r\nbuilt during the previous five years. From these general facts it\r\nmay be understood why the constant additions made to the “leviathans\r\nof the deep” excite comparatively so little interest, except where\r\nmatters of dimension or mere bulk are supplemented by questions of\r\nexceptional speed or novel construction.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table of steamships above 4000 tons gross register\r\npresently afloat or being constructed affords information interesting\r\nfrom several such standpoints; and shows in what years the product of\r\nbig ships has been greatest, as well as what proportion of individual\r\ncredit falls to the various centres engaged in their production.\r\nThe vessels are arranged in the order of their tonnages, which in\r\nevery case available is the gross register tonnage. While most of\r\nthe information conveyed in the table is such as may be gathered\r\nseparately from the registries, the form in which it has been\r\ncompiled, and the fact of the moulded in place of the registered\r\ndimensions being given, makes it valuable for reference. Except in a\r\nfew instances, where it was impossible to obtain them, the dimensions\r\nof the vessels have been supplied by the respective builders.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting the table, several of the most noteworthy features\r\nof the information it conveys may be pointed to. The list comprises\r\nno fewer than 138 vessels, 50 of which are constructed of steel. The\r\nyear 1881 occurs twenty-six times in the subjoined table, that number\r\nof vessels over 4000 tons having been turned out within the year. As\r\nalready stated, this number is over two-thirds the total number for\r\nthe ten years immediately preceding 1881, and is exactly double the\r\nnumber for the preceding five years. The year 1882 occurs twenty-four\r\ntimes, the year 1883 fifteen times, and the present year—although, of\r\ncourse, subject to possible additions—twenty-one times.\r\n\r\nThe following summary gives the number of vessels of the “leviathan”\r\norder launched in each year since 1858—the year which witnessed the\r\nproduction of the _Great Eastern_—an achievement as regards size\r\nwhich has not hitherto been equalled:—\r\n\r\n  1858      1 | 1865      6 | 1872      3 | 1879      4\r\n  1859      0 | 1866      0 | 1873      9 | 1880      3\r\n  1860      0 | 1867      2 | 1874      9 | 1881     26\r\n  1861      0 | 1868      0 | 1875      3 | 1882     24\r\n  1862      1 | 1869      0 | 1876      0 | 1883     15\r\n  1863      3 | 1870      2 | 1877      1 | 1884     21\r\n  1864      2 | 1871      1 | 1878      2 |\r\n\r\nThe column giving the districts in which the vessels have been built,\r\nshows—what doubtless is already well recognised—that the Clyde is\r\nsupreme in this quantitative aspect of steamship production. That\r\nriver occurs seventy-nine times in the table, a number equivalent\r\nto 57 per cent. of the total of all the centres put together.\r\nBarrow follows next in order, but with the relatively insignificant\r\ncontribution of twelve—although it is worthy of note that this\r\ncontribution is entirely made up by the vessels of one firm: _i.e._,\r\nthe Barrow Shipbuilding Company—the Mersey contributes eleven, the\r\nTyne ten, and the other districts correspondingly lower numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _List of Steamships above 4000 Tons Gross Register presently Afloat\r\n  (or at one time in

use in some of our leading mercantile shipyards by\r\nwhich the calculations undertaken there are rendered greatly more\r\nsimple, and are more expeditiously made, seem not to be generally\r\nknown amongst shipbuilders, and as they undoubtedly save much\r\nof the labour and time of calculation, without any sacrifice of\r\naccuracy, illustrations of them are here given, together with brief\r\nnotes of their construction and use. For anything, however, like a\r\nsatisfactory account of the mathematical principles on which these\r\nseveral instruments are based, readers must consult the authoritative\r\nsources to which references will be made.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the reader appreciates the advantages of shortened\r\ncalculation, due to the slide rule, or the use of logarithms, the\r\nfirst instrument that may be noticed is one embodying an application\r\nof the principle of the slide rule in a remarkably handy and compact\r\nform. This is the calculating slide rule invented by Professor\r\nFuller, of Queen’s College, Belfast, equivalent to a straight slide\r\nrule 83 feet 4 inches long, or a circular rule 13 feet 3 inches in\r\ndiameter. From the illustration given it may be seen that the rule\r\nconsists of a cylinder which can be moved up and down upon, and\r\nturned round, an axis, which is held by a handle. Upon this cylinder\r\nis wound spirally a single logarithmic scale. Fixed to the handle of\r\nthe instrument is an index. Two other indices, whose distance apart\r\nis the axial length of the complete spiral, are fixed to an inner\r\ncylinder, which slides in like a telescope tube, and thus enables the\r\noperator to place these indices in any required position relative to\r\nthe outer cylinder containing the logarithmic scale. Two stops—one\r\non the fixed and the other on the outer or movable cylinder—are so\r\nplaced that when they are brought in contact the index points to the\r\ncommencement of the scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nFULLER’S RULE.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the manner of using the instrument a few general notes\r\nmay be given. As in the ordinary slide rule the operations of\r\nmultiplication and division are performed by the addition or\r\nsubtraction of the parts of the scale that represent in length the\r\nlogarithm of the numbers involved in the operations.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the following calculation is to be worked out\r\n\r\n  (6248 × 5936 × 4217)/(7963 × 4851) = 4049\r\n\r\nTo do this in the ordinary way would keep the smartest arithmetician\r\nbusy for a considerable time, whereas by means of the instrument\r\nunder notice the result is attained in little over one minute’s time.\r\nThe motions in the operation are as follows:—Hold the rule by the\r\nhandle in one hand and move the scale cylinder by the other until the\r\nnumber 6248 is opposite the index attached to the handle portion.\r\nNow, move the inner cylinder (by the top) until one or other of the\r\nindices (according to the distance of the number from the bottom of\r\nthe instrument) on the index arm is opposite the number 7963. The\r\nscale cylinder is again moved till the number 5936 is opposite one\r\nof the indices just referred to, and the inner cylinder carrying the\r\nindex arm is then moved till one or other of the indices is opposite\r\n4851. Finally, the scale cylinder is moved till the number 4217 is\r\nopposite one of the indices on the arm; and the result of the whole\r\noperation—4049—is found opposite the index first-mentioned, _i.e._,\r\nthat attached to the handle portion of the instrument.\r\n\r\nIt may be further explained that the sliding of the scale cylinder\r\nuntil the new number is opposite the index point really involves two\r\noperations: one sliding it till the end of the scale is opposite\r\nthe index point—which subtracts the logarithm of the divisor; and\r\nthe other sliding it till the next multiplier is opposite the index\r\npoint—which adds its logarithm to the previous result. Hence, when\r\nthe operations end with division the scale cylinder must be moved\r\ntill the end of the scale is opposite the index point.\r\n\r\nThe second scientific instrument to be noticed is the Polar\r\nPlanimeter, invented by M. J. Amsler-Laffon, Schaffhausen,\r\nSwitzerland, the object of which is to find the area of any figure by\r\nsimply tracing the outline with a pointer, the instrument—of which\r\nthe pointer is a part—doing all the rest; the results read off from\r\nit having to undergo only a very simple and elementary calculation to\r\nattain the desired result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nAMSLER’S POLAR PLANIMETER—(FIXED SCALE).]\r\n\r\nPlanimeters are made of several forms, the two kinds illustrated by\r\nFigs. 25 and 26 being the most usual.[34] The planimeter shown by\r\nFig. 25 represents the instrument as made to one scale only, for\r\nsquare inches of actual measurement. By its means the areas of, say,\r\ncross sections of ship’s hull can be ascertained in an extremely\r\nshort time and with almost perfect accuracy, the readings taken\r\nfrom the instrument having simply to be multiplied by a multiplier\r\nconsisting of the square of the number of units to the inch,\r\ncorresponding to the scale on which the sections are drawn, as 4 for\r\n½-inch scale, 16 for ¼-inch, 64 for ⅛-inch, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nAMSLER’S PLANIMETER—(VARIOUS SCALES).]\r\n\r\nThe Planimeter shown by Fig. 26 is the instrument in a form adaptable\r\nto various scales, but does not possess any very marked advantages\r\nover the simpler form for the purposes of the naval architect or\r\nmarine engineer, so that notice of it must be brief. In this form\r\nof the instrument the unit can be changed by altering the length of\r\nthe arm which carries the tracer to any of the scales for which the\r\ninstrument may be made available, and which are found divided upon\r\nthe variable arm. The scales which are usually provided for are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  10 sq. in.      = 10 square inches         }\r\n  0·1 sq. f.      = 0·1 square foot          }\r\n  1 sq. dcm.      = one square decimetre     }  Every total\r\n  0·5 sq. dcm.    = 0·5 square decimetre     }  rotation of\r\n  2000 sq. m. }   = 2000 square metres on a  }  the roller.\r\n  1 : 500     }         scale 1 : 500        }\r\n  1000 sq. m. }   = 1000 square metres       }\r\n  1 : 500     }         scale 1 : 500        }\r\n\r\nDescribing the simple planimeter more in detail, and referring to\r\nFig. 25, it may be said the outline of the figure to be dealt with is\r\ntravelled round by a pointer attached to a bar moving on a vertical\r\naxis carried by another bar, which latter turns on a needle point\r\nslightly pressed into the drawing surface. The bar with the pointer\r\nis provided with a revolving drum having a graduated circumference\r\nand a disc counting its revolutions. The drum is divided into 100\r\nparts, reading into a vernier, which gives the reading of the drum’s\r\nrevolution to the 1/1000 part of its circumference. Upon the same\r\naxis as the drum an endless screw is cut, working into a worm wheel\r\nof ten teeth connected with the counting disc, which records the\r\nrevolutions of the drum.\r\n\r\nTo use the planimeter, place the instrument upon the paper so that\r\nthe tracing point, roller, and needle point, all touch the surface\r\nat any convenient position. Press the needle point down gently, so\r\nthat it just enters the paper, and place the small weight supplied\r\nwith the instrument over it. Make a mark at any part of the outline\r\nof the figure to be computed, and set the tracing point to it. Before\r\ncommencing read off the counting wheel and the index roller. Suppose\r\nthe counting wheel marks 2, the roller index 91, and the vernier 5,\r\nthen, the unit in this case being 10 sq. ins., write this down 29·15\r\n(for the proportional or variable-scale planimeter this reading\r\nwould be 2·915.) Follow with the tracing point exactly the outline\r\nof the figure to be measured in the direction of the movement of the\r\nhands of a watch, until you arrive at the starting point; now read\r\nthe instrument. Suppose this reading to be 47·67, then by deducting\r\nthe first reading (29·15) the remainder (18·52) indicates that the\r\nmeasured area contains 18·52 units—i.e., square inches—which is the\r\nfinal result, so far as the instrument is concerned. To obtain the\r\nactual area in feet, however, this result must be multiplied by the\r\nnumber before explained corresponding to the scale on which the\r\nfigure that has been measured is drawn.[35] Assuming the scale to\r\nhave been ¼-inch per foot, then 18·52 inches multiplied by 16—the\r\nappropriate multiplier for that scale—gives 296·32 square feet, the\r\nexact area.\r\n\r\nSeveral important points remain to be noticed in connection with\r\nthe use of the instrument. As a rule, the areas to be measured in\r\nconnection with ship designing are on a small scale, and the fixed or\r\nneedle point about which the instrument moves can always be placed\r\n_outside_ the figure measured, in which case the process remains as\r\nabove stated. It should be mentioned, however, that by placing the\r\nneedle point _inside_ the figure, in such a position as to enable the\r\noperator to follow its contour a larger figure can be measured at one\r\noperation—the reading, however, being less than the true area by a\r\nconstant number which varies slightly with the construction of each\r\ninstrument, and which is found engraved on the small weight already\r\nreferred to (on the top of the bar in the proportional planimeter).\r\nAdding this constant number to any reading taken by the instrument\r\nplaced as described, gives the true area.\r\n\r\nThe counting disc may go through more than one revolution forwards\r\nor backwards. If the needle point be _outside_ the figure traversed\r\nthe counting disc can only move _forwards_ (as 9, 0, 1, 2, &c.): that\r\nis, provided the figure has been traced in the manner directed—in\r\nthe direction of the hands of a watch. Then as many times as the\r\nzero mark passes the index line add 10·000 to the _second_ reading.\r\nIf the needle point be _inside_ the figure, the disc can move either\r\nforwards or backwards.

J. Amsler-Laffon, was invented theoretically shortly after\r\nthe planimeter just described (in the year 1855), but was first\r\nconstructed for practical use in the year 1867, the first instrument\r\nmade being exhibited in the Paris International Exhibition in\r\nthe year named. It was not introduced into England till the year\r\n1878, and although adapted for other uses than those involved in\r\nscientific calculations connected with shipbuilding it was in this\r\nconnection that attention was first seriously directed towards it.\r\nIn 1880 the late Mr C. W. Merrifield described the instrument, and\r\ntraced the mathematical principles upon which it is based, before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects, and in 1882, before the same\r\nbody, Mr J. H. Biles, naval architect for the firm of Messrs J. &\r\nG. Thomson, called attention to the usefulness of the instrument in\r\nstability investigations, showing by specimen calculations and other\r\nparticulars its great adaptability to this class of work, even in the\r\nhands of youthful and untrained operators. A still more recent and\r\nexhaustive paper devoted to the claims of the integrator upon naval\r\narchitects was read before the same Institution by Dr A. Amsler, the\r\nson of the inventor, at its last meeting. This paper was chiefly\r\nconcerned with demonstrating the advantages of the integrator in\r\nrespect of time saved, as well as in respect of its great accuracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\n\r\nAMSLER’S MECHANICAL INTEGRATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the integrator is to find at one operation the area,\r\nthe statical moment, and the moment of inertia of any closed curve\r\nor figure by simply tracing out the curve with a pointer, the\r\nresults being read off directly from the instrument, as in the\r\ncase of the planimeter, and with a correspondingly small amount\r\nof after calculation. As shown by Fig. 25, the essential parts of\r\nthe integrator are a rail =L=, having groove with which to guide\r\nthe wheels _p_ and _q_ of a carriage provided with rollers =D_{1}=\r\n=D_{2}= =D_{3}= moving on the surface of the drawing. The contour\r\nof the figure to be dealt with is traced—in the direction of the\r\nmovement of the hands of a watch—by the pointer =F=, this pointer\r\nbeing attached to an arm moving on the vertical centre of the\r\ninstrument while the whole mechanism runs to and fro on the rail =L=.\r\nUnder these conditions the rollers =D_{1}= =D_{2}= =D_{3}= execute\r\nmovements partly rolling, partly sliding, and by readings taken from\r\nthe divisions engraved upon their circumferences at the beginning\r\nand the end of the whole movement, together with simple arithmetical\r\nprocesses, the nature of which may be inferred from the explanations\r\ngiven of the planimeter readings, the three quantities sought are\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nIn a valuable appendix to the paper read by Dr Amsler, before the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects, specimen sheets are given of several\r\ncalculations, of a vessel of about 4000 tons, the forms in which the\r\nfigures are entered being so arranged as to avoid all unnecessary\r\ntrouble in measuring and calculating, and to contain at the same\r\ntime a check on the results. The accuracy and the speed of working\r\ndepend, of course, to a considerable extent on the person using the\r\nintegrator, but as showing what can be obtained with the instrument\r\nafter some practice, the specimens given in the paper referred to are\r\ncertainly remarkable. For the calculations of the data necessary for\r\nthe construction of the curves of displacement and vertical position\r\nof centre of buoyancy, the complete integrator and arithmetical\r\nwork took only two hours; for the data requisite for the curve of\r\ndisplacement per inch immersion, and transverse metacentre one hour\r\nwas taken; and for the complete calculation, affording data to\r\nconstruct a stability curve, the time taken was only eight hours.\r\nA similar calculation done in the ordinary arithmetical method,\r\nand giving results far less reliable, would have taken as many\r\ndays. All the work, it should be added, was done without the aid\r\nof an assistant. Amongst other calculations besides displacement\r\nand stability in connection with which the integrator is greatly\r\nadvantageous, are those concerned with the strength of vessels and\r\nwith the longitudinal strains to which they are subject at sea\r\nthrough unequal distributions of weight and buoyancy, already fully\r\nreferred to in the chapter on scientific progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNETT & THOMSON, PRINTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PORTRAIT\r\n  AND\r\n  BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n  JOHN BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BURNS, F.R.A.S., F.R.G.S.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN OF THE CUNARD STEAMSHIP COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn at Glasgow and educated at the University in that city. At an\r\nearly age became a partner in the firm of G. & J. Burns, which was\r\nfounded in 1824 by George Burns (his father) and James (his uncle),\r\nalso in the Cunard Steamship Company, of which gigantic concern, as\r\nis well known, his father, with Samuel Cunard and David M‘Iver, were\r\nthe founders in 1839. From the first Mr BURNS earnestly addressed\r\nhimself to the responsibilities of his important position, and\r\nfinding able coadjutors in his other partners in the Cunard Company,\r\nhas carried on the concerns of that great Steamship Line so as to\r\nenhance its reputation and maintain first place in the Atlantic Mail\r\nService. In 1880, forty years after its formation, the Company was\r\ntransformed into a public corporation, with Mr BURNS as chairman. The\r\nfleet now consists of 37 steamers, representing over 110,000 tons,\r\nor a money equivalent of nearly £3,000,000, and giving employment\r\nto an enormous number of persons. While everything is done on board\r\nto ensure speed and comfort, the main consideration, to which all\r\nothers are made subservient, is _safety_. First-class vessels,\r\nunstinted equipment, carefully-selected officers and men, combined\r\nwith close personal supervision, are the means used to attain this\r\nend, and that it is attained marvellously is matter of world-wide\r\nfame. Apart from his able management of the Cunard fleet, Mr BURNS\r\nhas not allowed the affairs of his Home Services between this\r\ncountry and Ireland and elsewhere, to suffer in any particular, but\r\nin his hands these concerns have flourished and the trade greatly\r\nincreased. The services are conducted by a splendid fleet of mail\r\nsteamers, now belonging exclusively to Mr BURNS, quite irrespective\r\nof the Cunard fleet, and which, for speed, safety, and unfailing\r\nregularity of departure and arrival, are probably unsurpassed. As\r\nrepresenting the Cunard Company, and also as a private shipowner,\r\nMr BURNS has taken frequent and conspicuous part in the discussion\r\nof those great matters which concern the maritime interests of\r\nthis country. Has often been called upon to give evidence before\r\nSelect Committees of the House of Commons on shipping affairs. Was\r\namongst the first to recommend to Government the desirability of\r\nfitting merchant steamships so as to be available in times of war.\r\nIs Deputy-Lieutenant of Lanarkshire, and Magistrate for the counties\r\nof Lanark and Renfrew. Evinces unbounded interest in the commercial\r\nand social well-being of his native city, numerous benevolent\r\ninstitutions in great measure owing their existence to his hearty\r\nmunificence. His residence of Castle Wemyss, on the Clyde, is\r\nfrequently the abode of the famous of this and other countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Burns (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o.

In 1845 removed to Glasgow, and in\r\n1847 entered the counting-house of Mr George Gillespie, where he\r\nwas chiefly employed in connection with the Allan Line service\r\nof clipper ships between Glasgow and Canada, for which trade Mr\r\nGillespie was then agent. In 1853 transferred his services to the\r\nAllan Line firm, where, for several years, was principal clerk and\r\ncashier, subsequently becoming partner. During the year 1853 the\r\nMessrs Allan resolved to add a fleet of steamers to their already\r\nwell-known line of clipper ships, and contracted for the building of\r\nfour screw vessels, the first of which—the _Canadian_—was launched in\r\nJuly, 1854. The growth of the business may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat the Allan fleet at the present time consists of twenty-eight\r\nsteamers, of 87,078 tons, and fifteen sailing vessels, of 21,225\r\ntons. Mr DUNLOP, since joining the firm, has taken an active part,\r\nalong with Mr Alexander Allan, its senior member, in the building\r\narrangements of the Allan Line. When mild steel was beginning to\r\ntake the place of iron in the construction of steamers, and before\r\nany of the Atlantic companies had ventured on its use, Mr DUNLOP and\r\nhis partners evinced ready confidence in the new material, their\r\nadoption of it being elsewhere referred to in this work. From an\r\nearly period Mr DUNLOP has taken an active interest in shipping\r\nlegislation. In 1874 gave evidence before the Select Committee of\r\nthe House of Commons upon the Measurement of Tonnage Bill, and again\r\nin 1882 before the Royal Commission on the same subject. During the\r\nPlimsoll agitation, and the consideration of the proposed legislation\r\nresulting from it, was a witness before the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse. In 1879 was deputed by the Shipowners Association of Glasgow\r\nto give evidence before the Select Committee upon the Merchant Seamen\r\nBill then before the House. In connection with Mr Chamberlain’s\r\nrecent efforts at legislation on Merchant Shipping, issued a pamphlet\r\nwhich very fully discussed the questions raised, and exhibited an\r\nanalysis of the losses of life in merchant shipping. Gave evidence\r\nduring the present year before the Load Line Committee, on which\r\nbody Mr DUNLOP had been invited to serve; business duties, however,\r\npreventing him accepting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours faithfully Nath^l Dunlop (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o.

He entered, at an early\r\nage, the mercantile marine service as an apprentice, and rapidly\r\nrose through the different grades of the profession to the command\r\nof various sailing ships and steamers belonging to the port of\r\nGlasgow. In 1853 he was admitted a partner in the shipping firm\r\nof Handyside, & Co., which, five years afterwards, was changed to\r\nHandyside & Henderson. Some years later, on the retirement of the\r\nMessrs Handyside and the assumption of Mr John Henderson and other\r\npartners into the business, the firm became Henderson Brothers, under\r\nwhich designation the greater part of the steam shipping business\r\nnow carried on by the Anchor Line steamships has been developed\r\nand extended. The fleet as now constituted consists of forty-five\r\nsteamships of an aggregate measurement of over 124,000 tons, with\r\nan engine power of above 25,000 horses nominal. These vessels are\r\nemployed severally in the Transatlantic, Indian, and Mediterranean\r\nservices, in all of which they are well known and appreciated by\r\nthe public as in all respects first-class, and second to no other\r\ncompeting line for safety, speed, comfort to passengers, and careful\r\ndelivery of goods carried. One branch of the extensive services of\r\nthe Anchor steamships, specially noteworthy as forming one of the\r\nmodern “express” lines which have given such impetus to ocean travel,\r\nis the express service between Liverpool and New York, in which the\r\nmagnificent steamships _City of Rome_ and _Austral_ are engaged. In\r\nconnection with their head office in Glasgow, Messrs Henderson Bros.\r\nhave established branch offices of their own in London, Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Barrow-in-Furness, Queenstown, Londonderry, Dundee,\r\nNew York, Boston, Chicago, Paris, Marseilles, and Palermo, at all\r\nof which the agency business of the several lines of steamers is\r\nattended to by their own employees. In addition to his responsible\r\nshare in the concerns of the Anchor Line, Mr HENDERSON is a partner\r\nin the extensive shipbuilding and engineering works of D. & W.\r\nHenderson & Co., at Meadowside, Partick, and Finnieston Quay,\r\nGlasgow. The estimation in which Mr HENDERSON is held as a shipping\r\nand commercial authority may be inferred from the enumeration of\r\nimportant offices at the head of this note; most of which he has\r\nworthily occupied for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very truly yours Thomas Henderson (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o.

Learned practical\r\nshipbuilding in Her Majesty’s Dockyard at Chatham, and was at\r\nthe same time engaged in the office of the master shipwright\r\nthere, the late celebrated Mr Oliver Lang. When the Government in\r\n1861 determined upon the construction of iron ships in the Royal\r\nDockyards, was the first officer selected to carry on that work,\r\nand superintended the building of H.M. _Achilles_ in the dockyard\r\nat Chatham. In 1863 left the Government service to become a\r\nSurveyor to Lloyd’s Registry in the Clyde district, and in 1864 was\r\nappointed General Manager in Messrs R. Napier & Sons’ shipbuilding\r\nestablishment, where, in 1865, his ability as a naval architect\r\nwas first brought into prominence through the designing of the\r\n_Pereire_ and _Ville De Paris_, built for the Compagnie General\r\nTransatlantique, which vessels maintained for several years a\r\nforemost place amongst the fast ships on the Atlantic. After the\r\ndeath of Mr John Elder, in 1869, joined by request the late Messrs\r\nJohn Ure and J. L. K. Jamieson in carrying on and extending the\r\ngigantic shipbuilding and engineering business at Fairfield, under\r\nthe title of John Elder & Co. In 1878 Mr Ure and Mr Jamieson retired\r\nfrom the firm, and Mr PEARCE became sole partner, which position he\r\nhas occupied up to the present time. Has constructed many steamships\r\nthat are amongst the most celebrated in existence, of which it may\r\nsuffice simply to name the _Arizona_, _Alaska_, and _Oregon_; the\r\n_Orient_, _Austral_, and _Stirling Castle_; also the _Umbria_ and\r\n_Etruria_, just being completed for the Cunard Steamship Company.\r\nAnother vessel built by Mr PEARCE, the construction of which excited,\r\nperhaps, a greater amount of interest than any of the above named,\r\nwas the yacht _Livadia_, for the late Emperor of Russia. The design,\r\nwhich was a fantastic one, was by Admiral Popoff. Mr PEARCE’S\r\nenterprize has not been confined to shipbuilding and engineering,\r\nhaving projected or become largely interested in several lines of\r\nsteamers, amongst which are, the Pacific Mail Steamship Co.; the\r\nNew Zealand Shipping Company; the Guion Line; and the China Line of\r\nthe Scottish Oriental Steamship Company. In 1880 Mr PEARCE gave the\r\nopening lecture in the course delivered in connection with the Marine\r\nExhibition held in the Corporation Buildings, Glasgow. In 1881 was\r\nappointed a member of the Royal Commission on Tonnage, and in October\r\nof the present year was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on\r\nMerchant Shipping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours faithfully W.

Removed to London in 1831, and entered the\r\ncounting-house of Mr James Thomson, a considerable shipowner, whose\r\nvessels were principally engaged in the West Indian trade. Assumed\r\npartnership with Mr Thomson in 1847, carrying on business as James\r\nThomson & Co., a connection which, unfortunately, was soon thereafter\r\nbroken, in the removal by death of Mr Thomson. In 1849 the business\r\nwas extended to the Australian trade, by the commencement of a\r\nline of sailing vessels to Adelaide, which soon became well-known\r\nand favourite traders. Some time after Mr Thomson’s death, the\r\nname of the firm was changed to Anderson, Thomson & Co., and in\r\n1869 it underwent a second change to Anderson, Anderson & Co., its\r\npresent designation. In 1876 the feasibility of running a direct\r\nline of steamships to Australia occurred to Mr ANDERSON and his\r\npartners, and was practically tested at their sole risk in that year.\r\nNotwithstanding the predictions that severe loss would result, the\r\nexperiments encouraged Messrs Anderson, Anderson & Co. to promote\r\nthe formation of a company to work such a service. Early in 1877,\r\nMessrs F. Green & Co. joined Messrs Anderson, Anderson & Co. in the\r\nenterprize, and on the 7th March, 1878, the steamer _Garonne_ left\r\nEngland for Australia, flying the flag of the ORIENT STEAM NAVIGATION\r\nCO., LIMITED, the designation “Orient” having been adopted through\r\nthe high reputation of the clipper ship of that name belonging\r\nto Messrs Anderson, Anderson & Co. Anticipations were at first\r\nconfined to the hope that sufficient trade might be found to justify\r\nmonthly sailings, but almost at once it was seen that a fortnightly\r\nservice was requisite. At the outset four steamers—the _Chimborazo_,\r\n_Lusitania_, _Cuzco_, and _Garonne_—were purchased by the Company,\r\nand one—the _Orient_—built. In January, 1880, the Pacific Steam\r\nNavigation Company entered, as it were, into partnership, by\r\nsupplying, in ready and admirable working order, the additional\r\nvessels required. The further additions to the fleet, and the nature\r\nof the service done, are referred to elsewhere in this work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Anderson (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o.

Entered the Royal Dockyard, Devonport,\r\nin 1859. Appointed to an Admiralty Scholarship in the Mathematical\r\nSchool there in 1863, and received a preliminary training in\r\nshipbuilding, ship-drawing, and applied mathematics. In 1864\r\nappointed an Admiralty student in the Royal School of Naval\r\nArchitecture and Marine Engineering, South Kensington, standing\r\nfirst in the competitive entrance examination, and maintaining\r\nthe first place throughout the course of training. Received his\r\ndiploma of Fellowship (first class) of the Royal School of Naval\r\nArchitecture in 1867, and was at once appointed to the Constructive\r\nDepartment of the Admiralty. From 1867 to 1883 continued in the\r\nRoyal Navy Service, and attached to the Admiralty Department, rising\r\nto be Secretary to the Council of Construction in 1873, Assistant\r\nConstructor in 1875, and Chief Constructor in 1881. Was appointed\r\nProfessor of Naval Architecture at the Royal School of Naval\r\nArchitecture in 1870, and continued to hold that position at South\r\nKensington, and at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, until 1881,\r\nconcurrently with his appointment at the Admiralty.

Under the designation of A. & J. Inglis\r\nthe combined businesses—the engineering works at Warroch Street, and\r\nthe shipyard at Pointhouse—have been conducted with marked success.\r\nHaving for some years attended the Glasgow Academy, Mr INGLIS,\r\nat the age of fifteen, entered the University, where for several\r\nsessions he studied under such teachers as the late Professors\r\nRamsay, Blackburn, and Rankine, and also under Sir William Thomson.\r\nOf Professor Blackburn’s mathematical and Professor Rankine’s\r\nengineering classes Mr INGLIS was a distinguished student; in the\r\nformer—although the youngest on the roll—carrying off several prizes,\r\nand in the latter acquiring a sound knowledge of applied mathematics\r\nas concerned with engineering and naval architecture. This experience\r\nwas afterwards supplemented by a term’s apprenticeship in the\r\npractical work of the engine shop. The art of naval construction,\r\nhowever, had always irresistible attraction for Mr INGLIS, and in\r\n1867 he seriously applied himself to the concerns of the shipyard,\r\ntaking an active share in its management ever since. Mr INGLIS’\r\ncareer, though uneventful, has been one of assiduous devotion to\r\nthe profession of Naval Architecture, especially as directed to\r\nscientific investigation and analysis. The fruits of this are\r\nreflected in many noteworthy and specialized steam vessels produced\r\nby his firm. Was the first shipbuilder on the Clyde to follow the\r\npractice of inclining vessels to ascertain their stability, and was\r\none of the earliest on the Clyde to apply the correct method of\r\nestimating longitudinal strains to the hulls of steamers. His firm\r\nhave been noted for the careful and elaborate trials of steamers on\r\nthe measured mile, and the digesting of such data. Is the author of\r\nseveral papers read before the societies with which he is connected,\r\none of which fully described the system of speed trial and analysis\r\nabove referred to. The designing and sailing of yachts are favourite\r\npursuits of Mr INGLIS; and the system of yacht ballasting by means\r\nof a lead keel forming portion of the hull structure was first\r\ninstituted by him in one of the many yachts built for his own use.\r\nUnder the title of “A Yachtsman’s Holidays,” he published, some years\r\nago, a volume giving a racy account of yachting experiences in the\r\nWest Hebrides. He wields a forcible pen, and it is not unfrequently\r\nemployed anonymously in the interests of shipbuilding and naval\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours faithfully John Inglis Junr (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o.

Educated at the School of\r\nMathematics and Naval Construction, Portsmouth, and served in the\r\nRoyal Dockyard, Sheerness. Leaving the Government service, he became\r\nthe editor of the “Mechanics’ Magazine,” in which position he first\r\nbecame known as an authority on Naval Architecture. Was one of the\r\noriginators of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1860, and for a\r\nnumber of years acted as Secretary to that body. Submitted proposals\r\nto the Admiralty concerning the construction of iron-clad ships,\r\nwhich were adopted in practice, and were so highly approved by the\r\nBoard of Admiralty that their author was appointed Chief Constructor\r\nof the Royal Navy in 1863. During the time he held that office,\r\ndesigned iron-clad ships and vessels of war of every class for the\r\nBritish Navy, and also—with the consent of the Government—some\r\niron-clad frigates for the Turkish Navy. In consequence of his\r\nobjections to rigged sea-going turret ships with low freeboard, of\r\nthe “Captain” class, and of the favour that type of ship found with\r\nthe Board of Admiralty, resigned his office in July, 1870—a step\r\nrendered remarkably significant by the lamentable capsizing of the\r\n“Captain” two months later. Since his resignation, has designed\r\niron-clad vessels and other classes of war ships for various Foreign\r\nPowers; numerous steam yachts, and smaller vessels. Has recently\r\ndevised and patented a method of construction for war ships which\r\nwill reduce to a minimum the destructive effect of marine torpedoes,\r\nand which promises to revolutionise present structural systems.\r\nIs the author of “Shipbuilding in Iron and Steel,” “Our Iron-clad\r\nShips,” “Our Naval Coast Defences,” “Japan: Its History, Traditions,\r\nand Religions,” as well as of several papers contributed to the\r\nInstitutions with which he is connected. Since his retirement from\r\nthe Admiralty has received numerous recognitions of his professional\r\nskill and ability, including various decorations from Foreign Powers.\r\nWas created a Knight Commander of the Bath, in 1880. In 1874 was\r\nreturned to Parliament in the Liberal interest as Member for the\r\nPembroke Boroughs, which he represented till 1880, when he was\r\nelected for the important constituency of Cardiff. During the summer\r\nof 1883 was deputed by the Government to investigate and report\r\nupon the “Daphne” catastrophe on the Clyde, the results of which\r\nare elsewhere referred to in this work. In February of the present\r\nyear was entrusted with the Presidency of the Committee appointed to\r\nenquire into the subject of the Load Line of vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly E. J.

Received a preliminary training in\r\npractical shipbuilding, and in the drawing office, at the Royal\r\nDockyard, Portsmouth, and studied in the Mathematical School there.\r\nWas appointed an admiralty student in the Royal School of Naval\r\nArchitecture and Marine Engineering, South Kensington, in 1864. In\r\n1867 was a draughtsman and assistant surveyor, in the Admiralty\r\nService, and in 1870 was foreman of the Royal Dockyard, Portsmouth.\r\nLeft the Admiralty Service at the end of 1871 to become the principal\r\nassistant of Sir E. J. Reed, K.C.B., M.P., in the designing and\r\nsurveying of war-ships, building for various Governments. In 1874\r\nwas general manager of Earle’s Shipbuilding & Engineering Company at\r\nHull. From 1876 to 1879 practised as a naval architect in London;\r\nand in 1879 went to Japan, by request of the Imperial Japanese\r\nGovernment, to advise upon matters relating to their navy. In\r\n1880 visited the principal arsenals and workshops of China, and\r\nreturned to this country in 1881. Since then has practised in London\r\nas a Consulting Naval Architect and Engineer, and designed and\r\nsuperintended the construction of numerous vessels. At the request\r\nof the builders and owners respectively, investigated the causes\r\nof the disasters which befell the “Daphne” and “Austral,” and gave\r\nevidence respecting the same at the official inquiries, held in\r\n1883. Immediately upon the “John Elder” Chair of Naval Architecture\r\nbeing founded in Glasgow University, through the munificence of Mrs\r\nElder, the University Court unanimously elected Mr ELGAR as the first\r\nProfessor. In 1884 was nominated by the Council of the Institution of\r\nNaval Architects as their representative upon the Board of Trade Load\r\nLine Committee.

Mr DENNY was\r\nborn at Dumbarton in 1847, and was educated at the High School\r\nof Edinburgh, under the late Mr John Carmichael, one of its most\r\ndistinguished teachers. In his seventeenth year, he left the\r\nHigh School, and entered on a course of practical training as a\r\nshipbuilder in Leven Shipyard, serving for stated terms in the\r\nvarious departments. Since 1870 he has been a partner, and of late\r\nthe managing partner, in the shipbuilding firm, and he has also\r\nshared in the partnership of the separate engineering business\r\nof Messrs Denny & Company. In addition to discharging the many\r\narduous duties pertaining to his business position, Mr DENNY is\r\nenabled to take a prominent part in the proceedings of several of\r\nthe professional societies with which he is connected. His whole\r\ntheoretical training has been acquired in business, his previous\r\neducation having been of a purely classical nature. In Mr DENNY\r\nthis experience has been eminently fruitful of results, evidence of\r\nwhich may be seen in the part he has taken—both personally and as\r\nrepresenting his firm—in various important movements dealt with in\r\nthe present work. Early in the present year, on a Committee being\r\nformed by the Board of Trade to enquire into the subject of the Load\r\nLine of Vessels, Mr DENNY was appointed a member.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm.

Was educated in the\r\nMathematical School at the Royal Dockyard, Pembroke, and received a\r\npractical training in shipbuilding in that dockyard. Was appointed\r\nan Admiralty student in the Royal School of Naval Architecture and\r\nMarine Engineering, South Kensington, in 1864, and passed out in\r\n1867 with the diploma of Fellow of the First Class. In 1867 was\r\nappointed a draughtsman in the department of the Controller of the\r\nNavy at the Admiralty, and served in that capacity till 1872, when he\r\nleft the Admiralty service for that of Lloyd’s Register of British\r\nand Foreign Shipping, in which Society he was shortly afterwards\r\nappointed Assistant Chief Surveyor. In 1881 he left Lloyd’s Register\r\nto become general manager to the Barrow Shipbuilding and Engineering\r\nCo. (Limited), at Barrow-in-Furness, which position he now occupies.\r\nWhile at the Admiralty, distinguished himself in original scientific\r\nwork in naval architecture—notably in 1868, by constructing the first\r\ncurve of stability which was ever produced; in 1870, by investigating\r\nthe stability of H.M.S. “Captain,” and pointing out, only a few\r\ndays before she was lost, the dangers to which she was liable; also\r\nby his calculations relating to the strength of war-ships, and\r\nconstructing for them the first curves of hogging and sagging and\r\nsheering strains. Since leaving the Admiralty, has enhanced his high\r\nreputation for scientific skill through his investigations into the\r\nstability and strength of mercantile ships, and the numerous valuable\r\npapers upon these and other subjects, which he has read before the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects, and other scientific bodies. Has\r\ndevoted himself largely and very successfully to the consideration\r\nof the principal causes of loss of ships at sea—both of sailing\r\nvessels and steamers; and has given most instructive evidence in\r\nsome of the principal cases which have been enquired into in recent\r\nyears. Several years ago, when sailing ships were being frequently\r\ndismasted, made a very lengthy and complete investigation of the\r\ncircumstances in which these casualties happened, and of their\r\ncauses; and the same is embodied in an elaborate report upon the\r\nsubject to the Committee of Lloyd’s Register. Was selected by the\r\nCommittee appointed to enquire into the loss of H.M.S. Atalanta to\r\ninvestigate the stability of that vessel as an independent check upon\r\nthe official Admiralty calculations, and his report and evidence\r\nshowed conclusively that she was capsizable, and probably did capsize\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm.

Son of Mr George\r\nPalmer, who was in early life engaged in Greenland whaling, and was\r\nsubsequently a merchant and shipowner at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Was\r\ntrained for a mercantile life, and having completed his education in\r\nFrance, became, at an early age, partner with his father in the firm\r\nof Palmer, Beckwith & Co., export merchants, timber merchants, and\r\nsawmill owners: a firm since styled Palmer, Hall & Co., and of which\r\nhe is now the senior. In 1845 assumed partnership with Mr John Bowes,\r\nthe late Sir William Hutt, and the late Mr Nicholas Wood, in the\r\nMarley Hill colliery and coke manufacture, and subsequently acquiring\r\nthe collieries of Lord Ravensworth & Partners, and of others, the\r\nconcern known as John Bowes, Esq. & Partners, has become, under Mr\r\nPalmer’s sole management, one of the largest colliery concerns in the\r\nnorth of England. In 1852, in partnership at first with his elder\r\nbrother George, commenced iron shipbuilding at Jarrow, in which year\r\nthey launched the _John Bowes_, notable as the first screw collier.\r\nThrough gradual extension the works at Jarrow have become the great\r\nestablishment described in the body of this work. Many vessels of war\r\nhave been built by Mr PALMER’S firm, and it was in the construction\r\nof the iron-clad _Terror_, in their works, at the time of the Crimean\r\nwar, that rolled in place of forged armour plates were first used,\r\nthe superiority of the change—since universally recognised—being then\r\nexperimentally demonstrated at considerable cost by Mr PALMER’S firm.\r\nAmong other enterprises which owe their existence wholly or partially\r\nto Mr PALMER may be mentioned the General Iron Screw Collier Company,\r\nthe Tyne Steam Shipping Company, several of the great lines of\r\nAtlantic and Mediterranean steamers, the Bede Metal Company, the Tyne\r\nPlate Glass Company, and Insurance Clubs for Steamers. In politics Mr\r\nPALMER is a Liberal, and after unsuccessfully contesting his native\r\ntown in 1868 he was, in 1874, elected M.P. for the northern division\r\nof Durham, a seat which he continues to hold. His country residence\r\nis at Grinkle Park, in Cleveland, but Parliamentary and other duties\r\nnecessitate his being much in London, where he has a town house. The\r\ninterest he has taken in behalf of the English shipowners has lately\r\nresulted in his appointment as one of the new English directors of\r\nthe Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours faithfully Chas.

Mr LAING’S\r\nearliest impressions and associations were connected with what was\r\nafterwards to become his life’s vocation, his boyhood having been\r\nspent in a home contiguous to his father’s yard. While a youth, he\r\nserved as an ordinary workman in the shipyard, and in 1843, his\r\nfather, on launching the “Cressy,” signalised the jubilee of a\r\nsingularly successful career by handing over to him the care and\r\ntitles of the business. Mr LAING continued to build wooden vessels\r\nuntil 1853, in which year the “Amity,” his first iron ship, was\r\nlaunched. In 1866 he entirely ceased building in wood, and since then\r\nhas built a very large number of iron vessels for various owners,\r\namongst others for such well-known companies as the Peninsular and\r\nOriental Steam Navigation Company, the Royal Mail Company, the Union\r\nSteamship Company of Southampton, etc. In 1883, he built for the\r\nlast-mentioned company the Mail Steamer “Mexican,” of 4669 tons.\r\nBesides the shipyard, he is the owner of graving docks connected\r\ntherewith, as well as extensive copper and brass works, and is\r\nprincipal proprietor of the Ayres Quay Bottle Works, which are\r\ncapable of turning out 33,000 bottles per day. For upwards of thirty\r\nyears Mr LAING has served as a member of the River Wear Commission,\r\nand as chairman since 1868. For years he has taken a leading position\r\namong shipbuilders and shipowners, not only in his own district,\r\nbut throughout the country. In 1883 he was chosen President of\r\nthe Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, and as official\r\nrepresentative of that interest has performed signal service, both\r\nwith reference to the Shipping Bill introduced to Parliament by Mr\r\nChamberlain and the recent agreement come to between the shipowners\r\nand the Suez Canal Company, of which company he has since been\r\nappointed a Director. For twenty years Mr LAING has acted as a member\r\nof the Board of Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, and at present is\r\nVice-President of the Load Line Committee, appointed by the Board of\r\nTrade for the settlement of a most important and intricate question.\r\nIn the shipbuilding and other cognate businesses Mr LAING is now ably\r\nassisted by his three sons, Philip, Arthur, and James.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Laing (signature)\r\n\r\nINK-PHOTO, SPRAGUE & C^o. LONDON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Since the above was written, the _Aurania_ and the _Oregon_ have\r\nresumed their services on the Atlantic, the results in the case of\r\nthe latter vessel being extraordinarily successful. On Saturday,\r\nthe 5th April, she arrived at Queenstown, having left New York on\r\nSaturday, the 29th March, making the trip in 7 days, 2 hours, 18\r\nminutes, her daily runs being:—45, 407, 396, 400, 302, 410, 384, 412,\r\nand 60; total, 2816 knots. Leaving Queenstown on Sunday, the 13th\r\nApril, she arrived at New York on Saturday, the 19th April, in the\r\nunprecedentedly short period of 6 days, 9 hours, 22 minutes.\r\n\r\n[2] While these sheets were passing through the press, the _America_\r\nwas tried unofficially on the Clyde, and attained a speed of 17\r\nknots, with about 6,500 indicated horse-power. On her passage from\r\nthe Clyde to the Mersey she maintained, it is stated, 18¼ knots over\r\nthe whole distance.\r\n\r\n[3] This list with those which follow other chapters, have been\r\ncompiled at considerable trouble in the hope that they may be of\r\nuse to technical readers in directing them at once to accurate and\r\ndetailed information. In this connection also, the excellent work by\r\nMr A. S. Seaton, “Manual of Marine Engineering,” and that by Mr W. H.\r\nWhite, “Manual of Naval Architecture,” may be referred to with every\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n[4] For full and excellent treatment of this subject, see the paper\r\non “Causes of Unseaworthiness in Merchant Steamers,” by Mr Benjamin\r\nMartell, Chief Surveyor to Lloyd’s Register, with the ensuing\r\ndiscussion: Trans. Inst., N.A., vol. xxi., 1880.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the causes above named it is doubtless the province of the\r\nscientific shipbuilder, and the duty of the shipowner, to obviate\r\nby furnishing the captain and officers—especially in the case of\r\nentirely new vessels—with particulars and data of the vessel’s\r\ntechnical character, such as are now left to be found out by slow\r\nand sometimes bitter experience. Of these it may be sufficient\r\nto instance:—Stability, steadiness, trim, carrying capability,\r\nand steaming powers. Mr William Denny, of Dumbarton, has recently\r\npublicly declared his firm’s intention of supplying such particulars\r\nto the vessels built by them. It is to be hoped this worthy example\r\nmay be extensively followed.\r\n\r\n[5] In this, as in other matters dealt with, the full appreciation of\r\nwhich involves careful technical study, readers are referred to the\r\npapers enumerated at the end of chapter, as well as to the “Manuals”\r\nalready referred to in this work.\r\n\r\n[6] The principle which underlies the experiment is this:—If any\r\none body forming part of a system of heavy bodies be moved from one\r\nposition in the system to another, the weight of the body moved\r\nmultiplied into the distance through which it is moved, is precisely\r\nequal to the weight of the whole system of bodies multiplied into\r\nthe distance through which the common centre of gravity of the whole\r\nhas moved. If in a ship, therefore, a movable weight of known amount\r\nis moved across the deck through a given known distance, the centre\r\nof gravity of the ship itself, with all on board, has been moved\r\nin a line parallel to that through which the small weight has been\r\ntransferred, and through a distance inversely proportioned to the\r\nweight of the whole ship to the weight moved. If, for instance, a\r\nweight of five tons should be moved through a distance of twenty\r\nfeet, then multiplying this weight into this distance and dividing by\r\nthe total weight of the ship, the distance through which the ship’s\r\ncentre of gravity has travelled parallel to the deck is obtained. If,\r\nat the same time, an exact measure of the angle through which the\r\nship has been inclined by moving the five tons through the distance\r\nnamed has been taken, and the position of the ship’s metacentre has\r\nbeen obtained, then the elements of a triangle are known—namely, the\r\ndegrees in each of its angles, and the length of one of the sides—and\r\nfrom these the length of the remaining sides of the triangle is\r\neasily deduced. One of these sides will be the distance between the\r\nmetacentre of the ship and its centre of gravity, and, consequently,\r\nthe metacentre being known from calculation, the position of the\r\ncentre of gravity becomes known also.\r\n\r\n[7] The classification of strains here given is as contained in\r\nWhite’s “Manual of Naval Architecture.” To this authoritative source\r\nreaders must turn who wish a full exposition of the several problems\r\ngo shortly dealt with in these pages.\r\n\r\n[8] This will be more fully referred to further on, but it may be\r\nstated here that the need for independent calculation is largely\r\nobviated, owing to the existence of “co-efficients,” deduced from\r\ninvestigations made by experts. Further, the existence and influence\r\nof the Registration Societies are such that the codes of scantling\r\nand the structural supervision instituted by them together constitute\r\nthe only guarantee of structural strength generally desiderated.\r\n\r\n[9] Suppose the dimensions of a proposed vessel to be 320 × 36 × 26½\r\nfeet, then, according to a method of approximation largely in use,\r\nthe sum of these dimensions divided by 100 gives what is known as the\r\n“cubic number”—(320 × 36 × 26½ ÷ 100) = 3052 cubic number. Suppose\r\nthat for a vessel already built, similar in type and dimensions,\r\nor of similar proportions, to the one proposed, the cubic number,\r\nwhen divided into the ship’s actual weight (_i.e._, the displacement\r\n_minus_ the weight of machinery and the dead-weight carried),\r\ngives say ·53, then this figure represents the “co-efficient” of\r\nship’s weight, and applying it in the case supposed gives:—3052 ×\r\n·53 = 1620, the weight of hull for proposed vessel. This example\r\nillustrates the manner in which the weight of machinery is estimated,\r\nand indicates the nature and use of the general term “co-efficient:”\r\nfrequently employed in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[10] One such method, devised and followed by Mr C. Zimmermann in\r\nhis daily practice as chief draughtsman to the Barrow Shipbuilding\r\nCompany, and described by him before the Institution of Naval\r\nArchitects in 1883, gives with very little preliminary calculation,\r\nand at once, a close approximation to the correct displacement.\r\nAnother system, originated and used in practice by Mr Chas. H.\r\nJohnson, chief designer to Messrs Wm. Denny & Brothers, consists of\r\nan analysis of the lines of vessels of various degrees of fineness\r\nand fulness previously built, formulated for daily use in a series of\r\ncurves of areas, giving, for sections at certain fixed distances from\r\nmidships—in terms of percentage to the midship area—the particular\r\narea specially suited to afford the required displacement; and at\r\nthe same time to maintain the general form of hull which in actual\r\npractice has proved satisfactory with respect to speed. In his later\r\npractice, Mr Johnson has found it preferable to use the block form of\r\nanalysis of Mr A. C. Kirk (considered further on in matters relating\r\nto speed), using the three sides of that form as a basis upon which\r\nto group the water-lines.\r\n\r\n[11] For illustrated descriptions of this and other improved\r\ncalculating instruments referred to in this chapter, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[12] This experimental method, it may be explained, has long been\r\npractised in connection with ships built for the Royal Navy, and for\r\na considerable number of years it has been systematically followed in\r\nsome leading merchant shipyards. Messrs A. & J. Inglis, Pointhouse,\r\nGlasgow, and Messrs Wm. Denny & Bros., Dumbarton, were amongst the\r\nearliest firms to systematically adopt the practice. With the former\r\nit has been customary to incline every vessel of distinctive type\r\nbuilt by them since 1871, and with the latter the practice has been\r\nconstantly followed from a date somewhat subsequent. For some years\r\npast other firms on the Clyde and elsewhere have adopted the method,\r\nthe data so accumulated being found an admirable basis from which to\r\nestimate the height of the centre of gravity in proposed vessels.\r\nTables giving the results of inclining experiments made on various\r\ntypes of merchant steamships and sailing vessels will be found in\r\n“White’s Manual of Naval Architecture,” pages 82-87.\r\n\r\n[13] From the first volume (1860) of the Transactions of the\r\nInstitution of Naval Architects, it is seen that Dr Inman, Samuel\r\nRead, and Dr Woolley had each already found different methods of\r\nsimplifying Atwood’s calculations.\r\n\r\n[14] Various other methods of simplifying the calculations based on\r\nAtwood’s theorem were subsequently proposed, and one or two different\r\nmethods also brought forward—notably one in 1876 by the late Mr\r\nCharles W. Merrifield, afterwards improved by the late Professor\r\nRankine, and one by Mr J. Macfarlane Gray, of the Board of Trade,\r\ndescribed by that gentleman in 1875, but since considerably improved.\r\nMost of them were laid before the Institution of Naval Architects in\r\npapers which will be found enumerated in the list at end of chapter.\r\nWhile such propositions did not contribute directly to bring the\r\nproblem of stability to its presently accepted form, they deserve to\r\nbe remembered as tokens of the great labour and skill which have been\r\nexpended in founding and developing this branch of scientific naval\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[15] “On Cross-Curves of Stability; their Uses, and a Method of\r\nConstructing Them, Obviating the Necessity for the Usual Correction\r\nfor the Differences of the Wedges of Immersion and Emersion.”\r\n\r\n[16] A detailed description of this valuable instrument will be found\r\nin Appendix.\r\n\r\n[17] Space forbids any detailed reference to these, but the names of\r\nthe papers and their respective authors will be found enumerated in\r\nthe list at end of chapter.\r\n\r\n[18] An obvious means of dealing approximately with stability, to\r\nwhich limits of space will not permit more than simple reference,\r\nconsists in so manipulating the data obtained by calculation for\r\nknown ships that it may be made available, either in the form of\r\ncurves or of tables, for determining the stability of proposed\r\nvessels. Methods of accomplishing this may of course vary to suit\r\nthe ideas and convenience of designers. A well-arranged system was\r\nbrought forward, jointly by Mr F. P. Purvis, head of Messrs W. Denny\r\n& Brothers’ scientific staff, and Mr B. Kindermann, one of his\r\nassistants, in a paper (see list at end of chapter) read before the\r\nInstitution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in April last. While the\r\nresults exhibited in the paper are immediately applicable to ships of\r\none particular form, whatever the length, breadth, depth, or draught\r\nmay be, this method still requires much development to make it at all\r\nuniversally applicable.\r\n\r\n[19] It is the usual practice to assume vessels to be laden with\r\nhomogeneous cargo of such a density as to fill the holds, and for\r\nthis condition to estimate the position of centre of gravity to be\r\nused in calculation.\r\n\r\n[20] See paper by Mr Kirk “On a Method of Analysing the Forms of\r\nShips and Determining the Lengths and Angles of Entrance.”—Trans.\r\nInst. N.A., vol. xii., 1880.\r\n\r\n[21] With the view of effecting an economy in time, and to enable\r\nthe trials at progressive speeds to be carried out while vessels are\r\nin a lengthened run out to sea, a method has been proposed by Mr J.\r\nH. Biles, naval architect to Messrs J. & G. Thomson, and adopted on\r\nboard the vessels tried by that firm, and also experimented with on\r\nsome of the vessels turned out by Messrs W. Denny & Bros., by which\r\nthe necessity for running with and against the tide on the measured\r\nmile is entirely obviated. The principle of the method is to measure\r\nthe time that a certain part of the length of the ship takes to pass\r\nan object thrown from the bows of the vessel well clear of the side.\r\nFor full particulars, both of the apparatus employed and of the\r\nresults of actual trials by this method compared with trials made on\r\nthe measured mile, see paper on “Progressive Speed Trials,” by Mr\r\nBiles, in the Transactions: Institution of Naval Architects, vol.\r\nxxiii., 1882.\r\n\r\n[22] A general outline of the operations conducted in Messrs Denny’s\r\ntank will be found in the description of their large works in Chap.\r\nVI. For a detailed account of the _modus operandi_ in the same\r\nestablishment, see abstract of a paper delivered in Dumbarton by Mr\r\nE. R. Mumford, of Messrs Denny’s Experimental Staff, printed in the\r\n_Engineer_ for 15th February and the _Steamship_ for 15th February of\r\nthe present year.\r\n\r\n[23] From experimental data obtained by Mr Froude, this correction\r\ncan be made with certainty. The reasons for it may be explained as\r\nfollows:—If an extremely thin short plane is drawn through the water\r\nit meets a certain resistance due entirely to surface-friction; that\r\nis, supposing the plane to be thin enough to eliminate wave-making\r\nand eddy-making. If the length of the plane is doubled while the\r\ndepth is kept the same, the resistance at the same speed is not, as\r\nmight at first appear to be the case, doubled accordingly. Owing to\r\nthe friction of (say) the first half of the plane, the water is made\r\nto partake of the motion of the plane, so that the second half of\r\nthe length, rubbing not against stationary water, but against water\r\npartially moving in its own direction, does not experience so much\r\nresistance from it. Adding a third equal length, it would have less\r\nsurface friction than the second, and so on to infinity.\r\n\r\n[24] See papers by Mr Mansel, enumerated in list at end of chapter.\r\n\r\n[25] For description of apparatus, see Trans. Inst. Mechanical\r\nEngineers, 1877.\r\n\r\n[26] A body which shortly afterwards joined with a kindred society in\r\nforming the “Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland,”\r\nhereafter noticed.\r\n\r\n[27] Following the methods laid down in the Treatise on Shipbuilding,\r\nedited by Prof. Rankine, Mr John Inglis, Pointhouse, instituted\r\ncalculations in 1873 of the longitudinal strains of two steamers\r\nbuilt by his firm, the form of the waves being assumed trochoidal.\r\nThe result of these calculations—which, under Mr Inglis’ directions,\r\nwere got out by Mr G. L. Watson, subsequently distinguished as a\r\nyacht designer, and then in the employ of Messrs Inglis—appeared in\r\nthe form of curves of hogging moments in _Engineering_ for 1st May,\r\n1874. Mr Inglis found that entering upon the work of calculation had\r\na very decided effect in giving him clearer ideas of how distribution\r\nof weight and buoyancy affected the structure of a vessel.\r\n\r\n[28] The substance of this paper is contained in a series of three\r\narticles on the Strength and Strains of Ships given in “Naval\r\nScience” (vol. i. and ii., 1872-3), a high-class journal ably edited\r\nby Sir E. J. Reed, but unfortunately abandoned after the fourth year\r\nof publication.\r\n\r\n[29] It should be stated that under certain circumstances of lading\r\nand support the value assigned by Mr John for the maximum bending\r\nmoment may be exceeded in merchant vessels, and that in some special\r\nclasses of ships—particularly light-draught vessels in certain\r\ncircumstances of lading and support—the sagging moment may prove of\r\nmost consequence. Instances are indeed on record of light-draught\r\nvessels giving way completely under the excessive sagging strain\r\nbrought upon them at sea.\r\n\r\n[30] The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland was\r\nformed in 1865 through the amalgamation of two separate bodies—“The\r\nInstitution of Engineers in Scotland” and “The Scottish Shipbuilders’\r\nAssociation.” The former of these was founded in 1857 and the\r\nlatter in 1860, the same year in which “The Institution of Naval\r\nArchitects” was established. The membership of the Institution at the\r\npresent time numbers nearly seven hundred, and comprises honorary\r\nmembers, members, associates, and graduates: the latter being a\r\nspecial section of the Institution, designed to embrace students or\r\napprentices in the profession, and fulfilling a very useful end.\r\nThe various offices have long been filled by gentlemen more or less\r\nactively engaged in the practice of shipbuilding or of engineering\r\non the Clyde, and the proceedings have assumed, on this account\r\nalone, a richer practical interest. Scientific subjects have also\r\nreceived their share of attention, and of the members taking the\r\nlead in this connection the names of Mr J. G. Lawrie and Mr Robert\r\nMansel are worthy of special mention. Along with Mr Robert Duncan\r\nand Mr Lawrance Hill, these gentlemen have, from the foundation of\r\nthe Institution, taken a specially warm interest in its prosperity,\r\nand have contributed not a little thereto by the numerous valuable\r\npapers they have brought before its meetings. The secretary of the\r\nInstitution is Mr W. J. Millar, C.E., himself the author of numerous\r\npapers, and the editor of the Transactions.\r\n\r\n[31] For interesting and reliable information on this head, as well\r\nas on other matters dealt with in this and the preceding chapter,\r\nsee Sir E. J. Reed’s excellent treatise on “Shipbuilding in Iron and\r\nSteel.”\r\n\r\n[32] This method of graphically representing tonnage output was\r\napplied for the first time by the author to the Clyde district from\r\nthe figures supplied by the _Glasgow Herald_ for each of the years\r\nsince 1860, and appeared, with much of the descriptive matter now\r\ngiven, in the issue of that journal for March 4th of the present year.\r\n\r\n[33] The following fragmentary returns have, through the kindness\r\nof a friend engaged in shipbuilding on the Tyne, been forwarded\r\nwhile those sheets were in the press. They have been gathered from\r\noccasional records in the local press, supplemented by personal\r\nknowledge, but may only be taken as approximate:—\r\n\r\n  Year. | No. of Vessels. |  Tons.\r\n        |                 |\r\n  1864  |       97        |  49,820\r\n  1865  |      123        |  77,500\r\n  1866  |      110        |  51,800\r\n  1867  |       81        |  34,080\r\n  1868  |       86        |  45,390\r\n  1869  |        —        |    ——\r\n  1870  |       95        |  86,420\r\n  1871  |        —        |    ——\r\n\r\n\r\n[34] These instruments, and the others here noticed, are supplied in\r\nthis country by Mr W. F. Stanley, the noted scientific instrument\r\nmaker of Great Turnstile, Holborn, London. They are described in\r\nhis treatise on “Mathematical Drawing Instruments,” from which\r\nwork, it should be stated, some of the present notes concerning\r\nthem are derived. A source of accurate information on the theory of\r\nplanimeter, to which Mr Stanley himself expresses indebtedness, is\r\nthe paper by Mr —now Sir—F. J. Bramwell, read before the British\r\nAssociation in 1872, and contained in the Association Reports for\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\n[35] The following is a list of the multipliers for converting the\r\nplanimeter readings to square feet for any required scale:—\r\n\r\n  1/16-in. scale = 256\r\n  ⅛-in.     do.  =  64\r\n  3/16-in.  do.  =  28·44\r\n  ¼-in.     do.  =  16\r\n  5/16-in. scale =  10·24\r\n  ⅜-in.     do.  =   7·11\r\n  ½-in.     do.  =   4·00\r\n  ¾-in.     do.  =   1·77\r\n  1-in.  scale   =   1·00\r\n  1½-in.  do.    =    ·44\r\n  3-in.   do.    =    ·111\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS RELATING\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nAPPLIED SCIENCE\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nE. & F.

To this end illustrations will be given of the\r\n  most recent arrangements of Horizontal, Vertical, Beam, Pumping,\r\n  Winding, Portable, Semi-portable, Corliss, Allen, Compound, and\r\n  other similar Engines, by the most eminent Firms in Great Britain\r\n  and America.
