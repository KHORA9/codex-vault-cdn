P. PUTNAM'S SONS\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AND LONDON\r\n\r\nThe Knickerbocker press\r\n\r\n1911\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION ON THE USE OF THE MAPS.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to gain a knowledge of the stars, if the learner\r\nsets to work in the proper manner. But he commonly meets with a\r\ndifficulty at the outset of his task. He provides himself with a\r\nset of the ordinary star-maps, and then finds himself at a loss\r\nhow to make use of them. Such maps tell him nothing of the position\r\nof the constellations _on the sky_. If he happen to recognize a\r\nconstellation, then indeed his maps, if properly constructed, will\r\ntell him the names of the stars forming the constellation, and also\r\nhe may be able to recognize a few of the neighboring constellations.\r\nBut when he has done this he may meet with a new difficulty, even\r\nas respects this very constellation. For if he look for it again\r\nsome months later, he will neither find it in its former place nor\r\nwill it present the same aspect,--if indeed it happen to be above\r\nthe horizon at all.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that what the learner wants is a set of maps\r\nspecially constructed to show him in what part of the sky the\r\nconstellations are to be looked for. He ought on any night of the\r\nyear to be able to turn at once to the proper map, and in that\r\nmap he ought to see at once what to look for, toward what point\r\nof the compass each visible constellation lies, and how high it\r\nis above the horizon. And, if possible (as the present work shows\r\nis the case), _one_ map ought to suffice to exhibit the aspect of\r\nthe whole heavens, in order that the beginner may not be confused\r\nby turning from map to map, and trying to find out how each fits\r\nin with the others.\r\n\r\nIt is to fulfil these requirements that the present maps have been\r\nconstructed. Each exhibits the aspect of the whole sky at a given\r\nday and hour. The circumference of the map represents the natural\r\nhorizon, the middle of the map representing the part of the sky\r\nwhich lies immediately overhead. If the learner hold one of these\r\nmaps over his head, so as to look vertically upwards at it, the\r\ndifferent parts of the horizon marked in round the circumference\r\nbeing turned towards the proper compass points, he will see the\r\nsame view of the heavens as he would if he were to lie on his back\r\nand look upwards at the sky, only that the map is a planisphere\r\nand the sky a hemisphere.\r\n\r\nBut although this illustration serves to indicate the nature of\r\nthe maps, the actual mode of using them is more convenient.\r\n\r\nLet it first be noted that properly speaking the maps have neither\r\ntop, bottom, nor sides. Each map may be held with any part of the\r\ncircumference downward: then the centre of the map is to be looked\r\nupon as the top for that part of the circumference. The portion\r\nof the map lying beneath the centre represents the portion of the\r\nsky lying between the point overhead and a certain part of the\r\nhorizon--the part in fact corresponding to the particular part\r\nof the circumference which is turned downwards. Thus if on any\r\nnight we wish to learn what are the stars towards the north, we\r\nlook for the map corresponding to that night. At the hour named\r\nthe stars toward the north will be those shown between the centre\r\nof the map and the top; and, of course, we hold the map upside\r\ndown so as to bring the centre above the northern part of the\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nBut this matter will be more clearly understood by comparing the\r\naccount of any of the accompanying maps with the map itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, it must be noted that, although the maps are necessarily\r\narranged in a certain order, there is in reality no first or last\r\nin the series. The map numbered I. follows the map numbered XII.\r\nin exactly the same manner that the latter follows the map numbered\r\nXI. The maps form a circular series, in fact.\r\n\r\nThe only reason for numbering the maps as at present, is that the map\r\nnumbered I. Happens to exhibit the aspect of the sky at a convenient\r\nhour on the night of January 1st. It will be found that the dates\r\nfollow on with intervals of seven or eight days right round the year,\r\nthe end of the year falling in the left-hand column of the table\r\nunder Map I., while the beginning of the year is in the right-hand\r\ncolumn of the same map.[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: It may be mentioned in passing, that the dates have\r\nnot been thrown in so as to fall regularly round the year, but\r\ncorrespond with the variations due to the earth's variable motion\r\nround the sun.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that a map can always be found corresponding\r\nto a convenient hour on any night of the year. (In midsummer, on\r\na few of the dates mentioned under the maps, night has not begun\r\nat the hour named.) On any date named under a map, the aspect of\r\nthe sky two hours later than that named is that represented in\r\nthe following map. Thus at eight o'clock in the evening of January\r\n22d, the aspect of the stars is as shown in Map I. At ten o'clock\r\non the same night the aspect of the sky is that shown in Map II., as\r\na date under that map shows. Applying this rule to the few occasions\r\non which the hour named is not available for observation (five or\r\nsix in all out of ninety-six dates), the observer can manage as\r\nwell for those occasions as for any others.\r\n\r\nNext, as to finding the north point, or any point of the compass\r\nwhich will enable the observer to determine the rest. If he is\r\nonly familiar with the aspect of those seven bright stars of the\r\nGreat Bear which have been called the Dipper, Charles' Wain, (really\r\n\"The Churl's Wain,\") the Butcher's Cleaver, and by other names,\r\nhe can always determine the north point by means of the two stars\r\ncalled the Pointers, since these seven stars never set. In the\r\nexplanation of each map I have shown where the Great Bear is to\r\nbe looked for on each night, the observer being assumed to have\r\nsuch a general knowledge of the direction of the compass-points,\r\nas will suffice for the purpose of finding so marked a collection\r\nof stars. Thus the pole-star is found, and for the purpose of such\r\nobservations as are here considered, this star may be looked upon\r\nas marking the exact direction of the north.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing further is required; but if the observer prefer it\r\nhe can determine the north point conveniently _at noon_ by setting\r\nup a vertical stick in the sunlight and noting the direction in which\r\nthe shadow lies. Once the observation has been made, he can note what\r\nobjects (these should be distant) lie towards the different points\r\nof the compass, and from that time he can use the accompanying maps\r\nwithout any reference to the Great Bear and the Pointers.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing that the stars called the Guardians of the\r\nPole form no bad time-piece when used with the aid of such maps\r\nas the present. They revolve round the pole once in twenty-four\r\nhours (less about four minutes), in a direction contrary to that of\r\na clock's hands. But stars near the equator, whose motions are much\r\nmore rapid, afford a yet better measure of time, if the direction\r\nof the south point is well determined.\r\n\r\nOf course, the observer who really wishes to become an astronomer\r\nwill not rest satisfied by learning only the principal stars shown\r\nin these maps. By means of the regular star-maps, such as those\r\nof my School Star Atlas, he will be able to explore the depths\r\nof all the constellations, having once learned their position and\r\ngeneral appearance from the accompanying maps. It will be well for\r\nthe student to remember that the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn will at times appear among the constellations here shown.\r\nVenus and Jupiter can always be recognized by their superior light,\r\nMars and Saturn by the steadiness with which they shine. The almanac\r\nwill always show when these planets and Mercury (often very bright\r\nin the clear skies of America) are above the horizon, and where\r\nthey are situate. They never appear except among the zodiacal\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nFor particulars and pictures of the different constellations, and\r\nother details associated with the study of the star-groupings,\r\nthe reader is referred to my \"Easy Star Lessons,\" published like\r\nthe present maps by Messrs. PUTNAM'S SONS.

The Dragon (_Draco_) lies due north, curving round under\r\nthe Little Bear, its head close to the horizon. Low down in the\r\nnorthwest is a part of the Swan (_Cygnus_). Higher up we see King\r\nCepheus, his wife _Cassiopeia_, and their daughter _Andromeda_\r\n(the Seated Lady and Chained Lady, respectively), with the Rescuer\r\n(_Perseus_) nearly overhead. The Winged Horse is setting, his head\r\nclose by the western horizon, and near the jar of the Water Bearer\r\n(_Aquarius_).\r\n\r\nIn the southwest is the Whale; and close by, the constellation\r\n_Pisces_, or the Fishes; above them the Ram (_Aries_), between which\r\nand _Andromeda_ the Triangles can be seen.\r\n\r\nIn the south the River (_Eridanus_) makes now its best show. Its\r\nleading brilliant, _Achernar_, is, however, never seen in the United\r\nStates. In the southeast the Great Dog, with the splendid Sirius\r\n(\"which brightliest shines when laved of ocean's wave\"), shows\r\nresplendently. Above is Orion now standing upright, treading on the\r\nHare (_Lepus_) and facing the Bull (_Taurus_), now at its highest. The\r\nDove (_Columba_) below the Hare is a modern and not very interesting\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nThe Little Dog (_Canis Minor_) is on the east of Orion. In the\r\neast the Sea Serpent (_Hydra_) is rising, and due east a little\r\nhigher we find _Cancer_, the Crab, (note the pretty cluster called\r\nthe Beehive (_Proesepe_)); above are the twins (_Gemini_), and\r\nabove them the Charioteer (_Auriga_), with the bright _Capella_,\r\nnearly overhead.\r\n\r\nThe Lion is rising in the northeast, his heart star _Regulus_ (a)\r\nbeing low down a little north of east.\r\n\r\nLastly, due north, high up, the absurd Giraffe (_Camelopardus_)\r\nstands proudly on his ridiculous head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) with its Dipper and Pointers, occupies\r\nthe northeasterly mid-heaven. A line from the Pole Star (a of the\r\nLittle Bear, _Ursa Minor_) to the Guardians, b and g, lies in the\r\nposition of the minute hand of a clock 23 minutes after an hour.\r\nThe Camelopard (_Camelopardus_) is above. The Dragon (_Draco_),\r\nwhose head is below the horizon, curves round the Little Bear to\r\nbetween the Guardians and the Pointers. In the northwest, fairly\r\nhigh up, we find _Cassiopeia_, the Seated Lady, and on her right,\r\nlower down, the inconspicuous constellation _Cephius_. _Andromeda_,\r\nthe Chained Lady, is on _Cassiopeia's_ left. The Great Nebula will\r\nbe noticed in the map--it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Above\r\n_Andromeda_ is _Perseus_, the Rescuing Knight, and above him the\r\nCharioteer (_Auriga_), nearly overhead. On the left of _Andromeda_\r\nis _Aries_, the Ram, the small constellation the Triangles lying\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nToward the southwest, the Whale (_Cetus_) is beginning to set. The\r\nRiver (_Eridanus_) occupies the lower part of the southwesterly\r\nsky, and extends also to the mid-heavens in that direction. The\r\nDove (_Columba_) is nearly due south, and at its best--which is\r\nnot saying much. Above is the Hare (_Lepus_), on which _Orion_\r\ntreads. The Giant now presents his noblest aspect--prince of all\r\nthe constellations as he is. He faces the Bull (_Taurus_), known\r\nby the _Pleiades_ and the bright _Aldebaran_.\r\n\r\nClose by the poor Hare, on the left, leaps _Canis Major_, the Greater\r\nDog, with the bright Sirius, which \"bickers into green and emerald.\"\r\nThe stern of the Star Ship (_Argo_) is nearing the south.\r\n\r\nVery high in the southeast we find the Twins (_Gemini_), with the\r\ntwin stars, _Castor_ and _Pollux_ (a and b); and below them the\r\nLittle Dog (_Canis Minor_). The Sea Serpent (_Hydra_) is rearing\r\nits tall neck above the eastern horizon (by south), as if aiming\r\neither for the Little Dog or for the Crab (_Cancer_), now high\r\nup in the east, with its pretty Beehive cluster showing well in\r\nclear weather. The Lion (_Leo_) is due east, the Sickle (marked\r\nby the stars a, ae, g, m, and e) being easily recognized.\r\n\r\nQueen Berenice's Hair (_Coma Berenices_, not _Berenicis_, as often\r\nignorantly given) is in the northeast. It used to mark the tip of\r\nthe real Lion's tail, just as the stars of the Crab marked his\r\nhead. The Hunting Dogs occupy the space between Berenice's Hair\r\nand the Great Bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP II.

The Pointers direct us to the\r\nPole Star, (a of the Little Bear _Ursa Minor_). A line from the\r\nPole Star to the Guardians of the Pole (b and g) lies in the position\r\nof the minute hand of a clock 18 minutes after an hour. The Dragon\r\n(_Draco_) extends from between the Bears to the horizon--east of\r\nnorth--where its head with its two bright eyes can be seen.\r\n\r\n_Cepheus_ is low down, somewhat to the west of north; his Queen\r\n(_Cassiopeia_) the Seated Lady, beside him (a and b mark the top rail\r\nof her chair's back); while above her lies the poor constellation\r\n_Camelopardus_, the Giraffe.\r\n\r\n_Andromeda_, the Chained Lady, is in the northwest, low down--in\r\nfact, partly set; the Triangles and the Ram (_Aries_) beside her,\r\ntoward the west. Above them is _Perseus_, the Rescuing Knight; and\r\nabove him, somewhat to the west, the Charioteer (_Auriga_). The\r\nBull (_Taurus_), with the _Pleiades_ and the bright _Aldebaran_,\r\nis in the mid-heaven, due west; _Gemini_, the Twins, higher, and\r\ntoward the southwest. _Orion_, below them, is already slanting\r\ntoward \"his grave, low down in the west\"; beneath him the Hare,\r\nand in the southwest a part of the River (_Eridanus_).\r\n\r\nDue south is a part of the Star Ship (_Argo_), beside which, low\r\ndown, is the foolish Dove (_Columba_), while above leaps the Great\r\nDog (_Canis Major_), with the splendid _Sirius_, chief of all the\r\nstars in the sky, marking his mouth.\r\n\r\nHigh up, a little west of north, is the Little Dog (_Canis Minor_);\r\nand higher, a little east of north, the Crab (_Cancer_), the \"dark\r\nconstellation,\" as it was called of old, with the pretty cluster\r\n_Proesepe_, or the Beehive.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Serpent (_Hydra_) is rearing his long neck high above the\r\nhorizon, bearing on his back, absurdly enough, Noah's Cup (_Crater_)\r\nand Noah's Raven or Crow (_Corvus_).\r\n\r\nNearly due east, the Virgin (_Virgo_) has risen, Spica shining\r\nbrightly just above the horizon. The Lion (_Leo_) occupies the\r\nmid-space above; the \"Sickle in the Lion\"--its handle marked by ae\r\nand a, its curved blade by g, m, and e--will at once be recognized.\r\nThe Hair of Queen Berenice (_Coma Berenices_) is nearly due east,\r\nand fairly high. Between this small but remarkable group and the\r\nGreat Bear, lies Hevelius's foolish constellation, the Hunting\r\nDogs (_Canes Venatici_). Lastly, in the northeast, the Herdsman\r\n(_Boötes_), with the orange-yellow brilliant, Arcturus, is rising,\r\nthough at present, paradoxical as it may seem, he lies on his back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--MARCH AND APRIL.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) is now nearing the point overhead,\r\nthe Pointers (a and b) aiming almost directly downward toward the\r\nPole Star. The line from this star (a of the Little Bear, _Ursa\r\nMinor_) to the Guardians (b and g) is now in the position of the\r\nminute hand of a clock about 13 minutes after an hour.\r\n\r\n_Cepheus_ lies north, low down, _Cassiopeia_ on his left, the Camelopard\r\nabove her, _Andromeda_ just setting, almost due northwest, on the left.\r\n_Perseus_ is due northwest, rather low, the Charioteer (_Auriga_) on\r\nhis left, but higher. Setting between west and northwest we see\r\nthe Bull (_Taurus_), with the _Pleiades_ and the ruddy _Aldebaran_.\r\n_Orion_ is almost prone in his descent toward his western grave.\r\nThe Twins (_Gemini_) are due west, in the mid-heavens; the Little\r\nDog (_Canis Minor_) beside them on their left, the Crab (_Cancer_)\r\nabove, the Greater Dog (_Canis Major_) below, chasing the Hare\r\n(_Lepus_) below the horizon. Just behind the Dog the poop of the\r\nGreat Ship (_Argo_) is also setting.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Serpent (_Hydra_) now shows his full length, rearing his\r\nhead high in the south. Observe the darkness of the region around\r\nhis heart, marked by the star a, _Alfard_, the Solitary One. The\r\nCup (_Crater_) and Crow (_Corvus_) stand on his back.\r\n\r\nThe Sickle in the Lion (_Leo_) now stands with handle upright, due\r\nsouth. Below the tail stars of the Lion we see the Virgin (_Virgo_),\r\nwith the bright _Spica Azimech_. The set of five third magnitude\r\nstars, above, was called by the Arabs, for reasons not explained,\r\nthe \"Retreat of the Howling She Dog.\"\r\n\r\nBehind the Lion, due east and high up, we see _Coma Berenices_,\r\nthe hair of Queen Berenice, between which and the tail of the Great\r\nBear we see in the chart one star only of the Hunting Dogs (_Canes\r\nVenatici_).\r\n\r\nThe Herdsman (_Boötes_), still on his back, pursues in that striking\r\nand effective position the Great Bear. Below the shoulder stars of\r\nthe Herdsman we see the Crown (_Corona Borealis_), near which, on\r\nthe right, low down and due east, the head of the Serpent (_Serpens_)\r\nis rising. _Hercules_ is also rising, but in the northeast.\r\n\r\nLastly, the stars of the Dragon (_Draco_) can be seen curving from\r\nbetween the Pointers and the Pole, round the Little Bear, then back\r\ntoward _Hercules_, the head of the Dragon, with the bright eyes,\r\nb and g, being rather low down, and somewhat north of northeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP IV.

A line from the Pole Star, (a of the Little Bear,\r\n_Ursa Minor_) to the Guardians of the Pole, (b and g) is now in\r\nthe position of the minute hand of a clock 8 minutes after an hour.\r\n\r\nBelow the Little Bear we find _Cepheus_ low down to the east of\r\nnorth, and _Cassiopeia_ low down to the west of north. _Perseus_,\r\nthe Rescuer, is setting in the northwest; the Camelopard is above,\r\ntrying to get on his feet.\r\n\r\nThe Charioteer (_Auriga_), with the bright _Capella_, is nearing\r\nthe northwestern horizon, followed by the Twins (_Gemini_), in the\r\nwest. Further west and higher we find the Crab (_Cancer_), below\r\nwhich is the Little Dog (_Canis Minor_).\r\n\r\nThe southwestern sky is very barren of bright stars. _Alfard_, the\r\nheart of the Sea Serpent, _Hydra_, shines here alone in a great\r\nblank space. Above the Sea Serpent's head we see the Sickle in the\r\nLion, _Leo_ himself stretching his tail to due south, very high\r\nup. _Coma Berenices_ is close by, and the Hunting Dogs (_Canes\r\nVenatici_) between _Coma_ and the Great Bear.\r\n\r\nIn the south, lower down, we find the Crow (_Corvus_), and the Cup\r\n(_Crater_), on the Serpent's back; the Virgin (_Virgo_), extending\r\nin the mid-heavens from southeast to south, between the Lion's\r\ntail and the Crow. In the same direction, but low down, we find\r\nthe head and body of the Centaur (_Centaurus_), supposed to have\r\ntypified the patriarchal Noah.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast the Scorpion's heart has just risen, and between\r\nthe head of _Scorpio_ and the Virgin's robes we see the stars of\r\nthe Scales (_Libra_).\r\n\r\nDue east, low down, is the Serpent-Holder (_Ophiuchus_), on his\r\nback--it is the customary attitude of heavenly bodies when rising.\r\nThe Serpent (_Serpens_) held by him is seen curving upward toward\r\nthe Crown (_Corona Borealis_). The Serpent's head is due west,\r\nand above it we see the bright Arcturus, chief brilliant of the\r\nHerdsman (_Boötes_).\r\n\r\nIn the northeast is _Hercules_, his head close to the head of the\r\nSerpent-Holder. Beneath his feet is the Lyre (_Lyra_) with the\r\nbrilliant _Vega_; and the Swan (_Cygnus_) has already half risen\r\nabove the northeastern horizon.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Dragon (_Draco_) curves from between the Pointers and\r\nthe Pole, round the Guardians toward _Cepheus_, and then retorts its\r\nhead, with gleaming eyes (b and g), toward the heel of _Hercules_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--MAY AND JUNE.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) occupies all the upper sky from the\r\nwest to north, except a small space occupied by the Hunting Dogs\r\n(_Canes Venatici_). The Pointers are in the northwest, almost\r\nhorizontal. A line from the Pole Star (a of the Little Bear--_Ursa\r\nMinor_) to the Guardians of the Pole (b and g) now occupies the\r\nposition of the minute hand of a clock 3 minutes past an hour.\r\n\r\nDue north, low down, lies _Cassiopeia_, while above, somewhat toward\r\nthe east, we find the inconspicuous constellation _Cepheus_. The\r\nCamelopard is in the west of north, and getting upright.\r\n\r\nLow down in the northwest lie the Charioteer (_Auriga_), and the\r\nhead stars of the Twins (_Gemini_) further west. The Crab (_Cancer_)\r\nis nearly due west, the Sea Serpent (_Hydra_) holding his head\r\nalmost exactly to the west point. Above is the Sickle in the Lion,\r\nits blade curved downward, and the tail of the Lion (_Leo_) lies\r\nabove, toward the south of west.\r\n\r\nOn the Serpent's back we find the Cup (_Crater_) and the Crow\r\n(_Corvus_), in the southwest and to the south of southwest respectively.\r\nAbove these constellations, and extending beyond the south toward\r\nthe east, the Virgin (_Virgo_) occupies the mid-heavens.\r\n\r\nAbove the Virgin we see the Herdsman (_Boötes_), his head and shoulders\r\nnearly overhead. Low down in the south is the Centaur (_Centaurus_),\r\nbearing on his spear the Wolf (_Lupus_) as an offering for the\r\nAltar (_Ara_), which, however, is invisible in these latitudes.\r\nAbove the Wolf we see the Scales (_Libra_), while the Scorpion\r\n(_Scorpio_), one of the few constellations which can at once be\r\nrecognized by its shape, is rising balefully in the southeast.\r\n\r\nThe Serpent Bearer (_Ophiuchus_) bears the Serpent (_Serpens_) in\r\nthe mid-heavens toward the southeast, the Crown (_Corona Borealis_)\r\nbeing high up in the east, close by the Serpent's head.\r\n\r\nLow down in the east is the Eagle (_Aquila_), with the fine steel-blue\r\nstar _Altair_, the Swan on the left about northeast, and above\r\nit the Lyre (_Lyra_), with the still more brilliant steel-blue\r\nstar _Vega_. Hercules occupies the space between the Lyre on the\r\none side and the Crown and the Serpent's head on the other. He\r\nis high up, due east.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Dragon winds from between the Pointers and the Pole\r\nround the Little Bear, toward Cepheus, and then eastward toward\r\nthe feet of Hercules, close by which we see his head and gleaming\r\neyes (b and g).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP VI.

They\r\ndirect us to the Pole Star (a of the Little Bear, _Ursa Minor_).\r\nThe line from this star to the Guardians of the Pole, b and g, is\r\nin about the position of the minute hand of a clock 2 minutes before\r\nan hour. The Dragon (_Draco_) curls over the Little Bear, curving\r\nupward on the east, to where its head, high up in the northeast, is\r\nmarked by the gleaming eyes, b and g. Under the Little Bear, the\r\nCamelopard has at last come upright.\r\n\r\nLow down in the west the Lion (_Leo_) is setting. The point of\r\nthe \"Sickle in the Lion\" is turned toward the horizon; the handle\r\n(marked by a and ae) is nearly horizontal. Above the Lion's tail\r\nis Berenice's Hair (_Coma Berenices_); and between that and the\r\nGreat Bear's tail our chart shows a solitary star of the Hunting\r\nDogs (_Canes Venatici_). The Crow (_Corvus_) is low down in the\r\nsouthwest, the Cup (_Crater_) beside it, partly set, on the right.\r\nAbove is _Virgo_, the Virgin. Still higher in the southwest--in fact,\r\nwith head close to the point overhead--is the Herdsman (_Boötes_),\r\nthe Crown (_Corona Borealis_) near his southern shoulder marking\r\nwhat was once the Herdsman's uplifted arm.\r\n\r\nLow down between the south and southwest we find the head and shoulders\r\nof the Centaur (_Centaurus_), who holds the Wolf (_Lupus_) due\r\nsouth. Above the Wolf are the Scales (_Libra_), and above these\r\nthe Serpent (_Serpens_), his head in the south, stretching toward\r\nthe Crown. In the mid-sky, toward the southeast, we find the Serpent\r\nBearer (_Ophiuchus_--one star of the Serpent lies east of him).\r\nBelow the Serpent Bearer we find the Scorpion (_Scorpio_), now\r\nfully risen, and showing truly scorpionic form. Beside the Scorpion\r\nis the Archer (_Sagittarius_), low down in the southeast. To his\r\nleft we see, low down, two stars marking the head of the Sea Goat\r\n(_Capricornus_), and one belonging to the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_).\r\nAbove the Sea Goat flies the Eagle (_Aquila_), with the bright\r\nstar _Altair_; and above, near the point overhead, is the kneeling\r\n_Hercules_. Due east, we see part of the Winged Horse (_Pegasus_);\r\nabove that, the little Dolphin (_Delphinus_), and higher, the Swan\r\n(_Cygnus_) and the Lyre (_Lyra_), with the beautiful bluish-white\r\nstar _Vega_.\r\n\r\nLastly, low down, between north and northeast, we find the Seated\r\nLady (_Cassiopeia_); and above, somewhat eastwardly, the inconspicuous\r\nconstellation _Cepheus, Cassiopeia's_ royal husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--JULY AND AUGUST.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) is now in the northwest, his paws\r\nnear the horizon. The Pointers (a and b) direct us to the Pole\r\nStar, (a of the Little Bear, _Ursa Minor_). A line from the Pole\r\nStar to the Guardians of the Pole is in the position of the minute\r\nhand of a clock about 7 minutes before an hour. Below the Little\r\nBear we see the Camelopard, a little to the east of due north.\r\nThe Dragon (_Draco_) curves round from between the Pointers and\r\nthe Pole, above the Little Bear toward the east, then upward to\r\nnear the point overhead, its head, with the bright stars b and g,\r\nbeing highest. Low down in the west we see Berenice's Hair (_Coma\r\nBerenices_), and one star of the Hunting Dogs (_Canes Venatici_) is\r\nseen in the chart between _Coma_ and the Great Bear. The Herdsman\r\n{_Boötes_) occupies the mid-heaven in the west, the Crown (_Corona\r\nBorealis_) higher up, and due west, Hercules, between the Crown\r\nand the point overhead.\r\n\r\nLow down, extending from the west to near the southwest, we find the\r\nVirgin (_Virgo_), the bright _Spica_ near its setting place. In the\r\nsouthwest are the Scales (_Libra_), and farther to the left, extending\r\nfrom the Scales to low down near the south, we find the Scorpion\r\n(_Scorpio_), one of the finest of the constellations, _Antares_,\r\nthe rival of Mars (as the name means), marking its heart. Above the\r\nScorpion and the Scales are the Serpent Bearer (_Serpentarius_ or\r\n_Ophiuchus_) and the Serpent (_Serpens_), extending right across\r\nhim to near the Crown, after which the Serpent seems reaching.\r\n\r\nA little east due south, low down, we find the Archer (_Sagittarius_);\r\nin the southeast, low down, the Sea Goat (_Capricornus_); and farther\r\neast, and lower down, the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_). Above the Sea\r\nGoat is the Eagle (_Aquila_), with the bright bluish-white star\r\n_Altair_; on its left the pretty little Dolphin (_Delphinus_),\r\nand above the Dolphin, nearly overhead, the Lyre (_Lyra_), with\r\nthe bluish-white star _Vega_ (even brighter than _Altair_) nearly\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nBelow the Lyre we see the Swan (_Cygnus_), due east; and below the\r\nSwan the Winged Horse (_Pegasus_), upside down, as usual.\r\n\r\nIn the northeast, _Andromeda_, the Chained Lady, is rising, her\r\nhead marked by the star a (which was also called d of _Pegasus_).\r\n(The \"Square of Pegasus\" is formed by a of _Andromeda_ and a, b,\r\nand g of _Pegasus_.)\r\n\r\nBetween the north and northeast is _Cassiopeia_, the Seated Lady,\r\nand above her, her husband, King _Cepheus_. And lastly _Perseus_\r\nis just rising, between the north and northeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP VIII.

A line from the Pole Star (a of the Little Bear, _Ursa\r\nMinor_) to the Guardians of the Pole (b and g), is in the position\r\nof the minute hand of a clock 12 minutes before an hour. Between\r\nthe Great Bear and the Little Bear run the stars of the Dragon\r\n(_Draco_), round the Little Bear toward the north, thence toward\r\nthe northwest, where we see the head of the Dragon high up, its two\r\nbright eyes, b and g, directed toward _Hercules_, which occupies\r\nthe western mid-heaven. Above Hercules is _Lyra_, the Lyre, with\r\nthe bright steel-blue star Vega high up toward the point overhead.\r\nRight overhead is the Swan (_Cygnus_).\r\n\r\nLow down in the northwest we see in the chart one star of the Hunting\r\nDogs (_Canes Venatici_). Nearer the west stands the Herdsman, rather\r\nslanting forward, however, with the Crown (_Corona Borealis_) on his\r\nleft, almost due west. The long winding Serpent (_Serpens_) runs\r\nfrom near the Crown (where we see its head due west) to farther\r\nsouth than southwest, high up on the western side of the Serpent\r\nHolder (_Serpentarius_ or _Ophiuchus_), now standing upright in\r\nthe southwest. Low down creeps the Scorpion (_Scorpio_), its heart\r\nAntares, rival of Mars, in the southwest, the end of its tail between\r\nsouth and southwest. Above and south of the Scorpion's tail we see\r\nthe Archer (_Sagittarius_).\r\n\r\nDue south, and high up, is the Eagle (_Aquila_), its tail at z and\r\ne, its head at th, the bright steel-blue Altair marking its body.\r\nOn the left, or east, of the Eagle lies the neat little Dolphin\r\n(_Delphinus_). Midway between the Dolphin and the horizon is the\r\ntip of the tail of the Sea Goat (_Capricornus_), whose head lies\r\nnearly due south.\r\n\r\nOn the southern horizon is the head of the Indian (_Indus_); on its\r\nleft a part of the Crane (_Grus_), and low down in the southeast\r\nlies Fomalhaut, the chief brilliant of the Southern Fish (_Piscis\r\nAustralis_). Above lies the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_), in the\r\nsouthwestern mid-heaven.\r\n\r\nDue east, fairly high, is \"the Square of Pegasus,\" the head of the\r\nWinged Horse, Pegasus lying close by the Water Pitcher of Aquarius\r\n(marked by the stars z, g, and a).\r\n\r\nThe Fishes (_Pisces_) are low down in the east. A few stars of\r\nthe Whale (_Cetus_) are seen on their right, very low down. On\r\nthe left of Pisces we see the Ram (_Aries_), low down; above it\r\nthe Triangle; and above that the Chained Lady (_Andromeda_).\r\n\r\nLow down in the northeast is the Rescuing Knight (_Perseus_); above\r\nwhom is _Cassiopeia_, and on her left, higher up, the inconspicuous\r\nconstellation _Cepheus_.\r\n\r\nLastly, immediately below _Cepheus_, we find the Camelopard, below\r\nwhich, very low down, between north and northeast, is the Charioteer\r\n(_Auriga_), the brilliant Capella being just above the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER.\r\n\r\nLow down, between north and northwest, we find the seven stars\r\nof the Dipper, the Pointers on the right nearly due north. They\r\ndirect us to the Pole Star. The Guardians of the Pole (b and g of\r\nthe Little Bear, _Ursa Minor_) lie in a direction from the Pole\r\nStar corresponding to that of the minute hand of a clock about 17\r\nminutes before an hour. Between the Pointers and the Pole Star we\r\nfind the tip of the Dragon's tail: then passing round the Little\r\nBear with the Dragon's long train of third magnitude stars, we come,\r\nafter a bend, to the Dragon's head, with the two bright eyes, a\r\nand b--(part of the Dragon's nose has been borrowed by Hercules).\r\nThese two stars are almost exactly midway between the horizon and\r\nthe point overhead, and nearly northwest. King Cepheus--not a very\r\nconspicuous constellation--lies between the point overhead and\r\nthe Little Bear.\r\n\r\nLow down in the northwest we find the head of the Herdsman (_Boötes_).\r\nThe Crown (_Corona Borealis_), which no one can mistake, lies on\r\nhis left; and close by is the setting head of the Serpent. Above\r\nthese three groups we see Hercules--the Kneeler--his head at a,\r\nhis upraised club by g. Above the head of Hercules we find the\r\nLyre, with the bright star Vega; and above that the Swan.\r\n\r\nPassing southward, we see the Serpent-Holder (_Serpentarius_ or\r\n_Ophiuchus_), beyond whom lies the Serpent's tail; a most inconvenient\r\narrangement, as the Serpent is divided into two parts. Almost exactly\r\nsoutheast, and low down, are the stars of the Archer (_Sagittarius_);\r\nwhile above, in the mid-sky, we see the Eagle (_Aquila_), with the\r\nbright Altair. Note the neat little constellation the Dolphin\r\n(_Delphinus_), close by.\r\n\r\nDue south is the Crane (_Grus_); above it the Southern Fish, with\r\nthe bright star Fomalhaut. Above that the Sea Goat (_Capricornus_),\r\nand on the left of this the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_); one can\r\nrecognize his water pitcher, marked by the stars b, g, and a.\r\n\r\nToward the west, high up, is the Winged Horse (_Pegasus_); he is\r\nupside down just now. Below lies the Whale (_Cetus_), or rather\r\nthe Sea Monster. I have my own notion about Cetus, regarding him\r\nas an icthyosaurus: but that is neither here nor there. The star\r\no of this constellation is called Mira; it is a wonderful variable\r\nstar. The Fishes (_Pisces_) may be seen between the Whale and Pegasus.\r\nFew constellations have suffered more than Pisces by the breaking\r\nup of star groups. The Fishes themselves are now lost in Andromeda\r\nand Pegasus.\r\n\r\nNote how on the left of Pisces the Ram (_Aries_) \"bears aloft\"\r\nAndromeda, the Chained Lady (whose head lies at a), as Milton set\r\nAries doing long since. The Triangles serve only as a saddle. Between\r\nAndromeda and her father, Cepheus, we find her mother, Cassiopeia, or\r\nrather Cassiopeia's Chair. (Of course b, a, and g mark the chair's\r\nback.) Perseus, the Rescuer, lies below; b is the famous variable\r\n_Algol_. Below him lies the Bull (_Taurus_), with the Pleiades and\r\nthe bright Aldebaran. Low down to the left of the Bull, we find\r\nthe Charioteer (_Auriga_), with the bright Capella. And lastly,\r\nanyone who likes may admire the Camelopard (_Camelopardalis_),\r\nbetween the Great Bear, Cepheus, and the Charioteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP X.

Sweeping around the Little Bear (_Ursa\r\nMinor_) we find the stars of the Dragon (_Draco_) curving back by\r\nthe star d to the Dragon's Head, with the two bright eyes, g and\r\nb. Above is the inconspicuous constellation Cepheus; and somewhat\r\nhigher, the stars of Cassiopeia, a and b, marking the top rail of\r\nthe Seated Lady's Chair.\r\n\r\nLow down in the northwest Hercules is setting. Above is the Lyre,\r\nwith the bright steel-blue Vega; and above that the stars of the\r\nSwan (_Cygnus_), which has sometimes been called the Northern Cross.\r\n\r\nNearly due west we find the Eagle (_Aquila_), z and e marking its\r\ntail, th the head. Above the Eagle is the pretty little constellation\r\n_Delphinus_, the Dolphin.\r\n\r\nIn the southwest, rather low, is the Sea Goat (_Capricornus_);\r\nabove and to the south of him the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_), with\r\nhis pitcher, marked by the stars, a, g, and z. The head of the\r\nWinged Horse, _Pegasus_, now upside down (in fact, he is seldom\r\notherwise), is just above this group. The \"Square of Pegasus\" will\r\nbe noticed high up, due south. The star a of Andromeda, one of\r\nthe corners of this square, used to be also called d of Pegasus.\r\n\r\nMuch attention need not be directed to the Phoenix, low in the\r\nsouthern horizon. The River _Eridanus_ is coming well into view;\r\nand the great Sea Monster (_Cetus_) now shows finely, his head at\r\na and g, his paddles at z and t. The Fishes (_Pisces_) are above;\r\nthe Ram (_Aries_) above them and eastward, lying toward the southeast;\r\nthen the Triangle (_Triangula_, or the Triangles, according to modern\r\nmaps), and the Chained Lady (_Andromeda_) too nearly overhead to be\r\nvery pleasantly observed. The great nebula in which the new star\r\nrecently appeared is near the point overhead.\r\n\r\nThe grand giant Orion is rising in the east; above him the Bull\r\n(_Taurus_) with the Pleiades. Low down in the northeast the Twins\r\n(_Gemini_) are rising; above is the Charioteer (_Auriga_), and\r\nabove him the Rescuing Knight (_Perseus_), \"of fair-haired Danae\r\nborn.\" The Camelopard is hardly worth noticing, except as marking\r\na barren region of the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SKY.--NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) is beginning to rise above the northeast\r\n(by north) horizon. The end of the Dipper's handle is hidden. A line\r\nfrom the Pole Star (toward which the Pointers direct the observer)\r\nto the Guardians of the pole (b and g of the Little Bear, _Ursa\r\nMinor_), is now in the position of the minute hand of a clock 27\r\nminutes before an hour. The stars of the Dragon wind round below\r\nthe Little Bear toward the west, the head of the Dragon with the\r\ngleaming eyes (\"oblique retorted that askant cast gleaming fire\")\r\nbeing low down, a little north of northwest. Above is King Cepheus,\r\nand above him his queen, the Seated Lady (_Cassiopeia_); their\r\ndaughter, the Chained Lady (_Andromeda_) being nearly overhead.\r\n\r\nLow down in the northwest we see the Lyre (_Lyra_), with the bright\r\nVega; and close by toward the west the Swan (_Cygnus_), or Northern\r\nCross. The Eagle is setting in the west, and the Little Dolphin\r\nnears the western horizon.\r\n\r\nToward the southwest (by west) we see the Water Bearer (_Aquarius_),\r\nwith his pitcher (b, g, a), close by which is the head of the Winged\r\nHorse (_Pegasus_). In the south, low down, is the absurd Phoenix;\r\nabove, the Sea Monster, or Whale (_Cetus_); above him, the Fishes\r\n(_Pisces_); above them, the Ram (_Aries_); while nearly overhead\r\nlies the Triangle, in reality the Triangles (_Triangula_).\r\n\r\nThe River (_Eridanus_) occupies the southeasterly sky. The Dove and\r\nGreat Dog (_Columba_ and _Canis Major_) are rising in the southeast.\r\nThe glorious _Orion_ has now come well into view, though not yet\r\nso upright as we could wish a knightly hunter to be. He treads\r\non the Hare (_Lepus_), and faces the Bull (_Taurus_) above.\r\n\r\nDue east we find the Crab (_Cancer_), and Little Dog (_Canis Minor_)\r\nlow down; the Twins (_Gemini_) higher; above them the Charioteer\r\n(_Auriga_), with the bright _Capella_, and _Perseus_ the Rescuer\r\nnearing the point overhead. In the mid-space between _Perseus,\r\nAuriga_, and the two Bears, we find the ridiculous constellation\r\n_Camelopardus_, or the Giraffe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP XII.
