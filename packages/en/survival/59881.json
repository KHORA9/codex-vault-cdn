James Andrus in command of a military expedition from\r\n            St. George, Utah, crossed the Paria River a few miles south\r\n            of Bryce Canyon.\r\n  1872      A. H. Thompson, geographer of the Powell Survey, sketched\r\n            the topography of the Pink Cliffs eastward to Rainbow Point\r\n            and ascended Table Cliffs. Lt. W. L. Marshall, topographer,\r\n            and G. K. Gilbert and E. E. Howell of the Wheeler Survey\r\n            mapped, described, and illustrated for the first time the\r\n            features of the park north of Campbell Canyon.\r\n  1874-76   Scattered settlements established in the Upper Paria\r\n            Valley. Ebenezer Bryce, for whom the park is named, ranged\r\n            cattle in the area. The region that includes Bryce Canyon\r\n            National Park studied by Capt. C. E. Dutton.

The major beauty spots of the\r\narea are found where forces of erosion have cut back into the plateau,\r\nforming amphitheaters or wide canyons filled with pinnacles and\r\ngrotesque forms.\r\n\r\nMost of the park area, with some 30 miles of Pink Cliffs, can be seen\r\nfrom Rainbow Point, at the southern end of the park. Included in this\r\npanorama are such beautiful amphitheaters as Black Birch Canyon, Agua\r\nCanyon, and Willis Creek. In addition, there are magnificent views\r\nacross \"the land of the purple sage\" to Navajo Mountain, 80 miles to the\r\neast, and to the Kaibab Plateau and the Trumbull Mountains to the south,\r\nthe latter 99 miles distant.\r\n\r\nIn reality Bryce is not a canyon; rather it is a great horseshoe-shaped\r\nbowl or amphitheater cut by water erosion into the Paunsaugunt Plateau\r\nand extending down a thousand feet through its pink and white marly\r\nlimestone. The character of the area is well indicated by the Paiute\r\nIndian name, \"Unka-timpe-wa-wince-pock-ich,\" which is translated as,\r\n\"red rocks standing like men in a bowl-shaped canyon.\" The largest\r\namphitheater is 3 miles long and about 2 miles wide, and is filled with\r\nmyriads of fantastic figures cut by weathering influences. Its domes,\r\nspires, and temples are decorated in all the colors of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe area was reserved as Bryce Canyon National Monument by Presidential\r\nproclamation, June 8, 1923. The act of June 7, 1924, authorized its\r\nestablishment as Utah National Park when certain conditions regarding\r\nland acquisition had been met. The act of February 25, 1928, changed the\r\nname from Utah National Park to Bryce Canyon National Park and\r\nmaterially increased the size of the area. On September 15, 1928, when\r\nall alienated lands within the proposed park area were transferred to\r\nthe United States, in accordance with the act of June 7, 1924, Bryce\r\nCanyon National Park was established. The park now embraces more than\r\n36,000 acres under Federal ownership.\r\n\r\nBryce Canyon National Park is one of the areas of the National Park\r\nSystem owned by the people of the United States and administered for\r\nthem by the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. In these\r\nareas the scenery and the objects of historic, prehistoric, and\r\nscientific interest are carefully preserved and displayed for public\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Geology of Bryce Canyon National Park[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regional Features._--In Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks the type\r\nof scenery peculiar to the plateaus of southern Utah and northern\r\nArizona attains its most complete expression. Layer upon layer of shales\r\nand sandstones have been carved into architectural forms, astonishingly\r\nalike for size and color. The long stretches of even skyline seen on\r\napproaching the parks from Cedar City (west), Panguitch (north), and\r\nGrand Canyon (south) give an impression of extensive flat surfaces that\r\nterminate in lines of cliffs, but viewpoints within the parks reveal a\r\nruggedness possessed by few other regions. The canyons are so narrow, so\r\ndeep, and so thickly interlaced, and the edges of the strata so\r\ncontinuously exposed that the region seems made up of gorges, cliffs,\r\nand mesas intimately associated with a marvelous variety of minor\r\nerosion forms. The parks might be considered as mountainous regions in\r\nwhich departures of many thousand feet from a general surface are\r\ndownward rather than upward.\r\n\r\nThe canyons and adjoining terraces are spectacular illustrations of\r\nerosion. They show with diagrammatic clearness the work of running\r\nwater, rain, frost, and wind, of ground water and chemical agencies\r\nactive throughout a long period of time. The horizontal tables and\r\nbenches, broken by vertical lines that in distant view appear to\r\ndominate the landscape, are normal features of erosion of plateau lands\r\nin an arid climate. The tabular forms are the edges and surfaces of hard\r\nstrata from which softer layers have been stripped. The vertical lines\r\nmark the position of fractures (joints)--lines of weakness which erosion\r\nenlarges into grooves and miniature canyons. As they entrench themselves\r\nin horizontal layers of rock that vary in resistance to erosion, the\r\nmaster streams and their tributaries are developing stairlike profiles\r\non their enclosing walls. Cliffs in resistant rocks and slopes in weak\r\nrock constitute risers and treads that vary in steepness and height with\r\nthe thickness of the strata involved. Thus near the south entrance to\r\nZion Park the edge of a layer of hard conglomerate is a vertical cliff,\r\nits top a platform. Above this platform a long slope of shale, broken by\r\nmany benches developed in hard beds, extends upward to the great cliff\r\nfaces of West Temple and the Watchman. In front of Zion Lodge a slope of\r\nweak shales leads upward to a cliff of resistant sandstone above which a\r\nslope of shale extends to the vertical wall of Lady Mountain. In Bryce\r\nCanyon the rim road is on the highest tread of a giant rock stairway\r\nthat, as viewed from Rainbow Point, leads downward in steps 30 to 400\r\nfeet high to the flat lands 3,000 feet below.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _View of multicolored formations from Bryce Point_\r\n    (_Union Pacific Railroad photo_)]\r\n\r\nThe streams at work in the parks, though relatively small, have steep\r\ngradients, including rapids and waterfalls, and are supplied with\r\ndisintegrated rock material swept from the ledges by torrential rains\r\nabout as fast as formed. They are therefore powerful agents of erosion,\r\nespecially in times of flood. The fresh, sharp, angular profile of\r\nmesas, ridges, and canyon walls and the extensive areas of bare rock are\r\nmaintained by the rapid down-cutting and prompt removal of rock waste.\r\nThe resulting land forms reflect the aridity and the topographic youth\r\nof southern Utah and contrast strongly with the rounded hills, broad\r\nvalleys, plant-covered slopes, and deep soils of more humid regions.\r\n\r\n_Geologic History._--A large part of geologic history is revealed in the\r\ncanyon walls of Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks. Just as Grand\r\nCanyon is the best known record of ancient geologic history, Zion Canyon\r\nrecords most clearly the events of medieval geological time, and Bryce\r\nreveals much of modern geologic history. The story of Zion begins where\r\nthat of Grand Canyon ends, and ends where Bryce begins. The rocks\r\nexposed in these three national parks incorporate the records of a\r\nbillion years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Generalized section of sediments in Zion and Bryce\r\n    Canyons_]\r\n\r\n  Age of rocks      Formation\r\n\r\n                                    lava\r\n  Eocene       Wasatch: Pink Cliffs                ROCKS IN BRYCE CANYON PARK\r\n  MESOZOIC\r\n  Cretaceous   Undifferentiated: Gray Cliffs\r\n                                    sandstone\r\n                                    shale\r\n                                    coal\r\n  Jurassic\r\n                                    gypsum\r\n               Carmel               limestone\r\n               Navajo sandstone:    cross-bedded   ROCKS IN ZION PARK\r\n               White Cliffs         sandstone\r\n               Kayenta-Wingate\r\n  Triassic\r\n               Chinle: Vermilion    shale,\r\n               Cliffs               sandstone,\r\n                                    ash and\r\n                                    limestone\r\n                                    fossil wood\r\n               Shinarump conglomerate\r\n               Moenkopi: Belted     shale\r\n               Cliffs\r\n                                    sandstone\r\n                                    oil            RIM OF GRAND CANYON\r\n  Permian      Kaibab limestone\r\n\r\nA study of the rocks of Zion and Bryce Canyon shows that during the last\r\n200,000,000 years the region comprising the parks has witnessed many\r\nchanges in landscape and climate. At times it was covered by the sea, at\r\nother times broad rivers traversed its surface, and at still other times\r\nit was swept by desert winds. Most of the rocks were laid down by water\r\nas gravel, sand, mud, and limy ooze. They have been converted into solid\r\nrock by the weight of layers above them and by lime, silica, and the\r\niron that cement their grains. Embedded in the rocks are fossil sea\r\nshells, fish, trees, snails, and the bones and tracks of land animals\r\nthat sought their food on flood plains, in forests, or among sand dunes.\r\nThe most conspicuous remains are those of dinosaurs--huge reptiles that\r\nso dominated the life of their time that the Mesozoic is known as the\r\n\"age of dinosaurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of some 8,000 feet of strata (Mesozoic and Tertiary) on\r\ntop of 4,000 feet of older (Paleozoic) beds, which are exposed in Grand\r\nCanyon, may be considered the first of three major events in the\r\ndevelopment of the marvelous landscapes of the Zion-Bryce region; it\r\nprovided the material from which the huge scenic features were later\r\ncarved. The second event was a regional uplift which elevated the\r\npreviously low-lying top beds of the series (Wasatch, Pink Cliffs) to a\r\nheight of nearly 2 miles above sea level. As a result of this movement,\r\nthe earth's crust was broken into huge rectangular blocks by north-south\r\nfractures or faults. Three of these great faults can be seen in the\r\nvicinity of the parks: the Hurricane fault in the Hurricane Cliffs, west\r\nof Zion; the Paunsaugunt fault in the cliffs of Bryce; and the Sevier\r\nfault along the Mount Carmel Road between the two parks.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the uplift the third major event, the present cycle of\r\nerosion, was initiated. The streams became strong and swift and so were\r\nable to cut deeply into the underlying rock and carry away the land\r\nwaste. In this process the streams have removed many cubic miles of\r\nrocks, which, if replaced, would fill the present canyons and build up\r\ntheir bordering land to the level of the lofty Markagunt and Paunsaugunt\r\nPlateaus. The gigantic features of Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks\r\nmark a stage in the process of erosion that began long ago and which, if\r\ncontinued without interruption, will convert the present rugged\r\nlandscape into plains near sea level.\r\n\r\n_Distinctive Features of Bryce Canyon._--In its regional setting Bryce\r\nCanyon National Park is the southeastern border of the extensive\r\nPaunsaugunt Plateau. It comprises two areas of strongly contrasted\r\ntopography that meet in a line that marks the rim of the plateau and the\r\ntop of its bordering cliffs. Back from the rim the plateau surface on\r\nwhich the park buildings and the automobile roads have been constructed\r\nis generally flat land traversed by broad, shallow valleys in which\r\nerosion is inconspicuous. Below the rim erosion has produced a region of\r\nremarkable ruggedness. It might naturally be supposed that the beautiful\r\namphitheater at the head of Bryce Canyon had been carved by waters\r\npouring down from the plateau above. But the plateau streams contribute\r\nnothing; they flow away from the rim. The chief sculpturing agents are\r\nthe rain and snow that fall directly into the canyon. In producing the\r\namazing variety of erosion features the streams have been aided by frost\r\nthat pries fragments from the cliffs and by chemical agencies that\r\ndecompose the rock and supply its vivid color.\r\n\r\nThe development of the park landscape was made possible by movements\r\nwithin the earth's crust which brought originally low-lying strata to an\r\naltitude exceeding 8,000 feet. Streamways on the flat top of this\r\nuplifted block were little affected, but with greatly steepened\r\ngradients the streams around the borders of the newly made plateau\r\nbecame powerful. The Paria and its swiftly flowing tributaries have cut\r\ndeeply into the face of the Paunsaugunt and carried billions of tons of\r\nground-up rock to the Colorado. At the present time erosion by Bryce\r\nCreek, Yellow Creek, Willis Creek, Podunk Creek, and many smaller\r\nstreams, is causing the plateau face to retreat northwestward, and these\r\nstreams are taking into their drainage areas channels that formerly\r\ncarried waters northward to Sevier River.\r\n\r\nThe drab-colored landscape along the southeast border of the park has\r\nbeen developed in alternating beds of shale, coal, and sandstone\r\n(Cretaceous age); in the resulting erosion forms, slopes, mounds,\r\nrounded ridges, and valleys with inclined or steplike sides predominate.\r\nThe brightly colored rocks that form the topmost cliffs and terminate\r\nabruptly in such headlands as Steamboat Mountain, Bryce Point, and\r\nRainbow Point are resistant limestones of Tertiary age (Wasatch\r\nformation). They erode as vertical walls (Pink Cliffs), which weathering\r\nhas developed into the astonishing display of architectural forms that\r\nmake Bryce Canyon distinctive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         How to Reach the Park\r\n\r\n\r\nIn going to Bryce Canyon National Park the motorist turns east from the\r\nmain highway, U S 89, 7 miles south of the town of Panguitch, Utah. From\r\nthat junction it is 25 miles to the park. This road follows Red Canyon,\r\na brilliantly colored little gorge which is often mistaken for Bryce\r\nCanyon itself. The approach to Bryce is unusual; no evidence of the\r\ncanyon is visible until the visitor walks to the rim and suddenly has\r\nrevealed to him the great sight in all its breath-taking beauty.\r\nImproved highways make Bryce Canyon National Park easily accessible\r\nexcept during the winter.\r\n\r\nTravelers by rail may reach the park over the Union Pacific Railroad to\r\nCedar City, Utah, the gateway to Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Grand Canyon\r\n(North Rim) National Parks and Cedar Breaks National Monument. Motor\r\nbuses of the Utah Parks Co. operate to those areas.\r\n\r\nMain bus lines operate from Salt Lake City and Los Angeles to Cedar\r\nCity, where passengers going to the park may transfer to buses of the\r\nUtah Parks Co. On prior notice, connections may be made with the Santa\r\nFe Trails System at Marysvale or Panguitch.\r\n\r\nUnited Air Lines serves Salt Lake City, and from there passengers may go\r\nby Union Pacific Railroad or bus to Cedar City. Air service is also\r\navailable from Los Angeles by Western Air Lines, with stops at Las\r\nVegas, Cedar City, and Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Roads and Trails\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Park Service has completed an excellent road, 20 miles\r\nlong, which follows the high rim the full length of the park plateau.\r\nShort spurs lead to such scenic places as Inspiration Point, Bryce\r\nPoint, Paria View, Natural Bridge, and Rainbow Point.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Bryce Canyon National Park_\r\n                      Drawn by R.

Those in the\r\nvicinity of headquarters are kept open throughout the winter, except for\r\nbrief periods during and immediately following storms.\r\n\r\nFine horseback and foot trails have been built in the interesting area\r\nunder the rim. They lead into Queen's Garden, Silent City, Fairyland,\r\nWall Street, Peek-a-boo Canyon, and other more remote points--each with\r\nits distinctive form. Trails are all easily traveled in good weather;\r\nhorseback trips can be arranged in half- or full-day units to suit the\r\nindividual. Inquiry should be made before attempting a trip, as stormy\r\nweather sometimes makes the condition of these trails uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nBryce Canyon National Park is administered as a unit with Zion National\r\nPark and Cedar Breaks and Zion National Monuments. The representative of\r\nthe National Park Service in immediate charge is the superintendent,\r\nwhose post office address is Springdale, Utah. All comments regarding\r\nservice in the park should be addressed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Naturalist Services\r\n\r\n\r\nEach evening illustrated talks are given by members of the staff, who\r\nalso conduct short hiking trips into Bryce Canyon every day of the\r\nsummer season, according to schedules posted by the naturalist service.\r\n\r\nVisitors are urged to use these facilities, which are provided free of\r\ncharge by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Museum\r\n\r\n\r\nAt park headquarters the National Park Service has established an\r\nofficial information office and museum which is open daily throughout\r\nthe main travel season. Here park visitors may secure information and\r\nfree publications regarding this and other national parks. The museum\r\nexhibits cover such subjects as geology, biology, archeology, and\r\nhistory. The Zion-Bryce Natural History Association maintains a stock of\r\npublications, maps, and transparency slides which are for sale at\r\nreasonable prices in the museum. They are designed to assist in a better\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Free Public Campgrounds\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attractive public auto camp, maintained by the Government, is open\r\nfrom about April 15 to November 15; however, these dates vary according\r\nto weather conditions. Pure water and sanitary conveniences are\r\nprovided, and groceries and campers' supplies may be purchased at the\r\nBryce Camp store. Camping is limited to 30 days a year for each party.\r\n\r\nFor those not carrying their own equipment and desiring to visit the\r\npark after the closing dates of the lodge and camp, there are camps near\r\nthe park where accommodations can be found at any time of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Accommodations\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attractive lodge is operated by the Utah Parks Co. from about May 30\r\nto September 25. It consists of a central building and cabins. The\r\ncabins are standard and deluxe types, the latter having private bath,\r\nporch, and fireplace.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Roads connecting Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon,\r\n    and Cedar Breaks_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Bryce Canyon Lodge_ (_Union Pacific Railroad\r\n    photo_)]\r\n\r\nMeals are served in the lodge dining room.\r\n\r\nThere is also a cabin development which is open from about May 1 to\r\nOctober 30. Here are available a cafeteria, food store, and sleeping\r\ncabins. The cabins are equipped with electricity, running water, double\r\nbeds, table, sink, shelves, and chairs.\r\n\r\nAs prices are subject to change from season to season, no rates are\r\nincluded in this booklet, but they may be obtained from the Utah Parks\r\nCo., Cedar City, Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Transportation\r\n\r\n\r\nMotorbus transportation and all-expense tours to Zion, Bryce Canyon, and\r\nGrand Canyon (North Rim) National Parks, Kaibab National Forest, and\r\nCedar Breaks National Monument are furnished by Utah Parks Co., Cedar\r\nCity, Utah, during the summer season and by special arrangement during\r\nthe remainder of the year. An automobile trip from Bryce Canyon Lodge to\r\nInspiration Point, Bryce Point, Paria View, Natural Bridge, and Rainbow\r\nPoint and return is offered during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Saddle Horses\r\n\r\n\r\nSaddle horses may be hired by the hour or day. Daily escorted trips are\r\nmade into the canyon and to Natural Bridge. Special guide service, if\r\navailable, may also be obtained. Riding outfits for women may be rented\r\nat the lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Post Office and Communication Service\r\n\r\n\r\nBryce Canyon Lodge is provided with post office, telegraph, and\r\nlong-distance telephone service. The post office address during the\r\nsummer season when the lodge is operating is Bryce Canyon National Park,\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Miscellaneous Services\r\n\r\n\r\nFountain service is available in the lodge. Photographs of Bryce may be\r\npurchased here, and laboratories are maintained for developing and\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nCurio stores, specializing in Indian handicraft, are operated.

A regular service station, located on the\r\nhighway near the lodge, furnishes gasoline, oil, tires, and batteries\r\nfrom approximately May 1 to October 30. Garages and service stations\r\noutside the park usually operate throughout the year.\r\n\r\nA registered nurse is on duty at the lodge when it is in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Cedar Breaks National Monument\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty miles east of Cedar City, within the Dixie National Forest, where\r\nthe high plateau breaks away to the west, is a great amphitheater called\r\nCedar Breaks, in the Pink Cliffs formation. The more spectacular part of\r\nthe formation was established as a national monument by proclamation of\r\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 22, 1933, and placed under the\r\nadministration of the National Park Service. The monument embraces an\r\narea of 6,172.20 acres of federally owned land.\r\n\r\nWhile Cedar Breaks is cut from the same geological formation as Bryce\r\nCanyon, there is a marked difference between these two scenic areas.\r\nThere are not countless numbers of outstanding temples, spires, and\r\nminarets in the Cedar Breaks bowl, but Cedar Breaks is on a more\r\ngigantic scale and has a greater variety of tints. The Pink Cliffs here\r\nhave a thickness of nearly 2,000 feet, and 47 different shades of color\r\nhave been distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe heavily forested rim attains an altitude of 10,700 feet. The cliffs\r\nare white or orange at the top, breaking into tints of deep rose and\r\ncoral. The high elevation also affords an excellent distant view of\r\nmountains and desert.\r\n\r\nThe Utah Parks Co. has provided a comfortable lodge with an attractive\r\ndining room, lobby, and rest rooms. Sleeping accommodations are\r\navailable in cabins operated in connection with the lodge. Groceries,\r\ncampers' supplies, gasoline, and oil may be procured. Cedar Breaks Lodge\r\nis open from about June 1 to September 20.\r\n\r\nA free public campground is maintained where water, cooking fireplaces,\r\nand fuel are furnished.\r\n\r\nThe season of accessibility varies with weather conditions, but is\r\nusually from early June to the first of November. On account of the high\r\naltitude, snows persist until late spring. During the summer season, the\r\nNational Park Service maintains an information office and small museum\r\nnear the parking area at Point Supreme.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Cedar Breaks_]\r\n\r\n  \"Let no one say, and say it to your shame,\r\n  That all was beauty here until you came.\"\r\n\r\nNational parks are established \"to conserve the scenery and the natural\r\nand historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the\r\nenjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave\r\nthem unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" Please\r\ncooperate in maintaining and protecting this park.
