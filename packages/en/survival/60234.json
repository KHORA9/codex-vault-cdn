At Mount\r\nRainier, as at other inactive volcanoes, the ever-present possibility of\r\nrenewed eruptions gives viewers a sense of anticipation, excitement, and\r\napprehension not equaled by most other mountains. Even so, many of us\r\ncannot imagine the cataclysmic scale of the eruptions that were\r\nresponsible for building the giant cone which now stands in silence. We\r\naccept the volcano as if it had always been there, and we appreciate\r\nonly the beauty of its stark expanses of rock and ice, its flower-strewn\r\nalpine meadows, and its bordering evergreen forests.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier owes its scenic beauty to many features. The broad cone\r\nspreads out on top of a major mountain range—the Cascades. The volcano\r\nrises about 7,000 feet above its 7,000-foot foundation, and stands in\r\nsolitary splendor—the highest peak in the entire Cascade Range. Its\r\nrocky ice-mantled slopes above timberline contrast with the dense green\r\nforests and give Mount Rainier the appearance of an arctic island in a\r\ntemperate sea, an island so large that you can see its full size and\r\nshape only from the air. The mountain is highly photogenic because of\r\nthe contrasts it offers among bare rock, snowfields, blue sky, and the\r\nincomparable flower fields that color its lower slopes. Shadows cast by\r\nthe multitude of cliffs, ridges, canyons, and pinnacles change\r\nconstantly from sunrise to sunset, endlessly varying the texture and\r\nmood of the mountain. The face of the mountain also varies from day to\r\nday as its broad snowfields melt during the summer. The melting of these\r\nfrozen reservoirs makes Mount Rainier a natural resource in a practical\r\nas well as in an esthetic sense, for it ensures steady flows of water\r\nfor hydroelectric power in the region, regardless of season.\r\n\r\nSeen from the Puget Sound country to the west, Mount Rainier has an\r\nunreal quality—its white summit, nearly 3 miles high, seems to float\r\namong the clouds. We share with the populace of the entire lowland a\r\nthrill as we watch skyward the evening’s setting sun redden the\r\nvolcano’s western snowfields. When you approach the mountain in its\r\nlovely setting, you may find something that appeals especially to\r\nyou—the scenery, the wildlife, the glaciers, or the wildflowers. Or you\r\nmay feel challenged to climb to the summit. Mount Rainier and its\r\nneighboring mountains have a special allure for a geologist because he\r\nvisualizes the events—some ordinary, some truly spectacular—that made\r\nthe present landscape. Such is the fascination of geology. A geologist\r\nbecomes trained to see “in his mind’s eye” geologic events of thousands\r\nor even millions of years ago. And, most remarkable, he can “see” these\r\nevents by studying rocks in a cliff or roadcut, or perhaps by examining\r\nearthy material that looks like common soil beneath pastureland many\r\nmiles away from the volcano.\r\n\r\nOur key to understanding the geology of Mount Rainier is that each\r\ngeologic event can be reconstructed—or imagined—from the rocks formed at\r\nthe time of the event. With this principle as our guide, we will review\r\nthe geologic ancestry of this majestic volcano and learn what is behind\r\nits scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Changing Landscape of 12-60 Million Years Ago\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Cascade Range provide a record of earth history that\r\nstarted nearly 60 million years ago. Even then, as today, waves pounded\r\non beaches and rivers ran to the sea, molding and distributing material\r\nthat formed some of the rocks we now see in the park.\r\n\r\nYou may find it difficult to imagine the different landscape of that far\r\ndistant time. There was no Mount Rainier nor Cascade mountain range. In\r\nfact, there was very little dry land in the area we call western\r\nWashington. Instead, this was a broad lowland of swamps, deltas, and\r\ninlets that bordered the Pacific Ocean. Rivers draining into this\r\nlowland from the east spread sand and clay on the lush swamp growth.\r\nOther plants grew on the deposits, and they were covered, in turn, by\r\nmore sand and clay. In this way, thousands of feet of sand and clay and\r\npeat accumulated and were compacted into sandstone, shale, and coal. We\r\ncan see some of the rocks formed at that time in cuts along the Mowich\r\nLake Road west of the park (fig. 1). Seams of coal were mined at\r\nCarbonado and Wilkeson, 10 miles northwest of the park, during the late\r\n19th and the early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nThese beds of sandstone, shale, and coal make up a sequence of rocks\r\ncalled the Puget Group, which is 10,000 feet thick. Wave-ripple marks\r\nand remains of plants show that the rocks were formed in shallow water\r\nfairly close to sea level. How could the rocks have piled up to this\r\ngreat thickness? The coastal plain and adjacent basin must have been\r\nslowly sinking, and the influx of sand and clay must have just barely\r\nkept pace with the downward movements.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Mount Rainier]\r\n\r\nA little less than 40 million years ago, the western Washington\r\nlandscape changed dramatically. Geologists R. S. Fiske, C. A. Hopson,\r\nand A. C. Waters have discovered that volcanoes then rose on the former\r\ncoastal plain at the site of Mount Rainier National Park and became\r\nislands as the area sank beneath the sea. When molten rock was erupted\r\nunderwater from the submerged flanks of these volcanoes, steam\r\nexplosions shattered the lava into countless fragments. The resulting\r\ndebris, mixed with water, flowed as mud across great areas of the\r\nsubmerged basin floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outcrop of gray to brown sandstone and dark-gray to black\r\ncoaly shale in the Puget Group along the Mowich Lake Road. (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\nYou can see rocks formed from these layers of volcanic mud and sand in\r\ncuts along the highway on the east side of Backbone Ridge and between\r\nCayuse Pass and Tipsoo Lake. Look there for alternating beds of\r\ngrayish-green sandstone and breccia, a concretelike rock in which the\r\npebbles have sharp corners. These rocks are known as the Ohanapecosh\r\nFormation. Like the Puget Group, the Ohanapecosh Formation is at least\r\n10,000 feet thick. Yet, nearly all of it accumulated in shallow water as\r\nwestern Washington continued to sink slowly during the volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued sinking finally ended after the Ohanapecosh volcanic\r\nactivity ceased. Western Washington was then lifted several thousand\r\nfeet above sea level, and the Puget and Ohanapecosh rocks were slowly\r\ncompressed into a series of broad shallow folds. Before eruptions began\r\nagain, rivers cut valleys hundreds of feet deep, and weathering of the\r\nrocks produced thick red clayey soils similar to those that are forming\r\nin some areas of high rainfall and high temperature today. Look for the\r\nred rocks formed from these old soils in roadcuts as you drive along the\r\nStevens Canyon road about 2 miles southeast of Box Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe next volcanic eruptions, which may have begun between 25 and 30\r\nmillion years ago, differed from those of Ohanapecosh time. These\r\nvolcanoes, somewhere beyond the boundaries of the park, erupted great\r\nflows of hot pumice that, being highly mobile, rushed down the flanks of\r\nthe volcanoes and spread over many square miles of the adjacent regions.\r\nThe pumice flows were “lubricated” by hot volcanic gas emitted from\r\ninside each pumice particle, which buffered it from other particles.\r\nSome hot pumice flows were 350 feet deep. The heat still remaining in\r\nthe pumice after it stopped flowing partly melted the particles to form\r\na hard rock known as welded tuff. Repeated pumice flows buried the hilly\r\nlandscape and eventually formed a vast volcanic plain. The rocks, which\r\nare mostly welded tuffs, are now the Stevens Ridge Formation, which you\r\ncan see along the highway in Stevens Canyon 1-2 miles west of Box\r\nCanyon. You can recognize the welded tuff by its light-gray to white\r\ncolor and its many flattened and sharp-edged inclusions of darker gray\r\npumice (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nAnother period of volcanism followed, of still a different kind, when\r\nlava flowed outward from broad low volcanoes. The flows were of two\r\nkinds: basalt, the kind now erupted by Hawaiian volcanoes, and andesite,\r\nthe type erupted by Mount Rainier. Individual flows 50-500 feet thick\r\nwere stacked on top of one another to a total depth of fully 2,500 feet.\r\nWe know these rocks as the Fifes Peak Formation. They form many of the\r\ncliffs and peaks in the northwestern part of the park. You can examine\r\nthem in cuts along the Mowich Lake Road between Mountain Meadows and\r\nMowich Lake. The time of the eruption of the Fifes Peak lavas may have\r\nbeen between 20 and 30 million years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fifes Peak volcanoes finally became extinct, this part of\r\nwestern Washington changed again. The rocks once more were uplifted and\r\ncompressed into broad folds parallel to those formed at the end of\r\nOhanapecosh time. The rocks buckled and, in places, broke and shifted\r\nthousands of feet along great fractures, or faults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outcrop of light-gray welded tuff in the Stevens Ridge\r\nFormation along the road in Stevens Canyon. The angular dark-gray\r\nfragments in the welded tuff are chunks of pumice. (Fig. 2)]\r\n\r\nAbout 12 million years ago one or more masses of molten rock, many miles\r\nacross, pushed upward through the Puget Group and younger rocks. When\r\nthis molten rock cooled and hardened, it formed granodiorite, a close\r\nrelative of granite. Although most of the molten rock solidified\r\nunderground, some of it reached the land surface and formed volcanoes at\r\na few places within the area of Mount Rainier National Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granodiorite looks like granite and has a light-gray\r\nspeckled appearance. The knife is about 3 inches long. (Fig. 3)]\r\n\r\nGranodiorite is probably the most attractive rock in the park. It is\r\nmostly white, but it contains large dark mineral grains that give it a\r\n“salt-and-pepper” appearance (fig. 3). The large size of the grains is a\r\nresult of the molten rock cooling slowly at a considerable depth below\r\nthe land surface—the individual minerals had a long time to grow before\r\nthe “melt” solidified into rock. In contrast, the rocks formed from\r\nlavas that flowed onto the ground surface are generally fine grained\r\nbecause the lavas cooled too quickly for the mineral grains to grow\r\nappreciably.\r\n\r\nGranodiorite underlies the White River valley, the Carbon River valley,\r\nand parts of the upper Nisqually River valley and the Tatoosh Range. You\r\ncan see it in roadcuts between Longmire and Christine Falls and at\r\nseveral places along the road between White River Ranger Station and\r\nWhite River campground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geological cross section of Mount Rainier and its\r\nfoundation rocks from Mother Mountain southward to Tatoosh Range.\r\nTrue-scale cross section is nearly 17 miles long. Slightly modified from\r\nU.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 444, Plate 1. (Fig. 4)]\r\n\r\nAfter the granodiorite solidified, the foundation of Mount Rainier was\r\ncomplete except for one other landscape change that preceded the birth\r\nof the volcano. Not long after the granodiorite was formed, the Cascade\r\nmountain range began to rise—not rapidly, but little by little over many\r\nthousands of years. As the land rose, rivers cut valleys into the\r\ngrowing mountains so that by the time the new volcano began to erupt,\r\nthe Cascades had already been carved into a rugged range of high ridges\r\nand peaks separated by deep valleys. Deep erosion thus laid bare the\r\nrock layers in which we today read the geologic history of the park\r\n(fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Thumbnail Biography of Mount Rainier\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life span of a volcano can be compared to that of an\r\nindividual—after his birth and a brief youth, he matures and grows old.\r\nThe birth date of Mount Rainier is not known for sure, but it must have\r\nbeen at least several hundred thousand years ago. We cannot tell much\r\nabout the volcano’s complex youth because most of its earliest deposits\r\nare now buried under later ones. At an early age, well before the cone\r\ngrew to its present size, thick lava, like hot tar, flowed repeatedly\r\n5-15 miles down the deep canyons of the surrounding mountains. Because\r\nthese lava flows resisted later erosion by rivers and glaciers, most of\r\nthem now form ridgetops, as at Rampart Ridge, Burroughs Mountain, Grand\r\nPark, and Klapatche Ridge (figs. 5 and 6). Violent explosions\r\noccasionally threw pumice onto the slopes of the growing volcano and the\r\nsurrounding mountains. As the volcano matured, the long thick flows were\r\nsucceeded by thinner and shorter ones which, piled on top of one\r\nanother, built the giant cone that now dominates the region. Even though\r\nMount Rainier has grown old now, it has revived briefly at many times\r\nduring the last 10,000 years or so and may erupt again in the future.\r\n\r\nThe events of the last 10,000 years, because they are so recent, in\r\nterms of geologic time, are better known than those of any earlier time,\r\nand we can examine this part of the volcano’s history in some detail. We\r\nwill study three principal subjects: eruptions—because they have had\r\nwidespread effects; glaciers—because they are such conspicuous features\r\non the mountain; and landslides—because they have drastically changed\r\nthe volcano’s shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Results of Recent Eruptions\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile hiking, you soon become aware that there is a large amount of\r\npumice along the trails in Mount Rainier National Park. Pumice is a\r\nlightweight volcanic rock so full of air spaces that it will float on\r\nwater. The air spaces, or bubbles, originated when fragments of gas-rich\r\nlava were explosively thrown into the air above the volcano, and the\r\nmolten rock hardened before the gas could escape. If you examine pumice\r\ndeposits in a trail cut, in a streambank, or in the roots of blown-over\r\ntrees, you may also note that there is more than one layer (fig. 7). If\r\nyou circle the volcano on the Wonderland Trail, you may notice that the\r\ngreatest number of pumice layers are on the east side of the park, but\r\nthe thickest single layer is on the west side. The explanation lies\r\npartly in the source of the pumice deposits, because some pumice was\r\nerupted not by Mount Rainier but by other volcanoes in the Cascade Range\r\nof Washington and Oregon and brought to the park by strong southerly or\r\nsouthwesterly winds. The layers of pumice thrown out by Mount Rainier\r\nwithin the last 10,000 years lie mostly on the east side of the volcano.\r\nStrong winds evidently swept eruption clouds to the east during the\r\noutbursts and prevented the pumice from falling west of the volcano.\r\nThis pattern of distribution, coupled with the coarsening and thickening\r\nof the pumice toward the volcano, reveals that the layers were erupted\r\nby Mount Rainier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An old lava flow from Mount Rainier which forms Rampart\r\nRidge west of the meadow at Longmire. The thick lava flowed down an old\r\nvalley floor and cooled and solidified. Rivers then eroded new valleys\r\nalong both sides of the flow. These new valleys, subsequently glaciated,\r\nare today followed by the Nisqually River and Kautz Creek. Thus, the\r\narea of a former valley floor is now a ridge. (Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Columns of dark-gray andesite at the east end of an old\r\nlava flow from Mount Rainier. This outcrop is near the point at which\r\nthe highway to Yakima Park crosses Yakima Creek. (Fig. 6)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Layers of pumice on the floor of a cirque near Paradise\r\nPark. The yellow bed at the bottom is layer O, which was erupted by\r\nMount Mazama volcano at the site of Crater Lake, Oregon, about 6,600\r\nyears ago. The yellowish-brown layer a few inches above layer O is layer\r\nD, a pumice that was erupted by Mount Rainier between 5,800 and 6,600\r\nyears ago. The light-yellowish-brown pumice bed at the top of the\r\noutcrop is layer Y, which originated at Mount St. Helens volcano between\r\n3,250 and 4,000 years ago. Photograph by D. R. Mullineaux, U.S.\r\nGeological Survey. (Fig. 7)]\r\n\r\nD. R. Mullineaux of the U.S. Geological Survey has studied in detail the\r\npumice deposits of Mount Rainier National Park. One of his first and\r\nmost important discoveries was that even though some pumice layers are\r\nspread widely over the park, they were erupted from other volcanoes.\r\nStrangely enough, one layer is thicker and more widespread than any\r\nrecent pumice erupted by Mount Rainier. We can clearly see that these\r\nforeign pumice layers did not come from Mount Rainier, for they thicken\r\nand coarsen southward, away from the park. The oldest was erupted by\r\nMount Mazama volcano at the site of Crater Lake, Oregon, about 6,600\r\nyears ago; this pumice forms a yellowish-orange layer about 2 inches\r\nthick nearly everywhere in the park. The pumice has a texture like that\r\nof sandy flour, and it feels grainy when rubbed between the fingers. It\r\nis so fine grained because of the great distance to its source, 250\r\nmiles due south of Mount Rainier. Near Crater Lake this same pumice\r\nconsists of large chunks and is many feet thick.\r\n\r\nTwo other foreign pumice deposits in the park were erupted by Mount St.\r\nHelens, a symmetrical young volcanic cone about 50 miles southwest of\r\nMount Rainier. The older of the two is between 3,250 and 4,000 years\r\nold; it forms a blanket of yellow sand-sized pumice that is as much as\r\n20 inches thick in the western part of the park. The younger pumice\r\nlayer is most conspicuous at the ground surface in the eastern part of\r\nthe park, where it is as much as 4 inches thick and resembles a fine\r\nwhite sand. It is about 450 years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount St. Helens as it appears from Mount Rainier.]\r\n\r\nAn inconspicuous bed of pumice records the first eruption of Mount\r\nRainier that occurred after Ice Age glaciers melted back to the slopes\r\nof the volcano. It can be found on the east side of the mountain from\r\nGrand Park south to Ohanapecosh campground (fig. 8). In roadcuts near\r\nthe east end of Yakima Park (Sunrise) the pumice forms a rusty-brown bed\r\nabout 4 inches thick which contains fragments as much as 2 inches\r\nacross. Wood from a thin layer of peat just above the pumice was dated\r\nby its content of radioactive carbon as about 8,750 years old; thus, the\r\npumice is even older. We call this pumice layer R for convenience; other\r\nletter symbols have been assigned to the younger layers (table 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Generalized distribution of some pumice layers within\r\nMount Rainier National Park.

Again, pumice spread over the area east of the volcano. The\r\nolder pumice, which we call layer L, covers a band only a few miles wide\r\nthat extends to the southeast from the volcano (fig. 8). The younger\r\npumice, layer D, covers an area at least 10 miles wide directly east of\r\nthe volcano. The distribution of both deposits shows that there were\r\nstrong directional winds during the eruptions. The long, narrow pattern\r\nof layer L probably was caused by strong northwesterly winds during a\r\nshort-lived eruption. The pattern of layer D was caused by winds from\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nSome time during these eruptions, hot volcanic bombs and rock fragments\r\nwere thrown out of Mount Rainier’s crater and fell onto surrounding\r\nareas of snow and ice. Wholesale melting resulted, and floods descended\r\nthe east flank of the volcano carrying millions of tons of ash, newly\r\nerupted rock debris, and breadcrust bombs. Breadcrust bombs seem to be\r\nsolid rock, but if you would break one open, you would find that the\r\ninside is hollow or is filled with a spongy mass of black glass. Their\r\nouter surfaces are cracked like the crust of a loaf of hard-crusted\r\nbread (fig. 9), so we call them breadcrust bombs. They originated as\r\nblobs of soft, red-hot lava which were thrown out of the volcano’s\r\ncrater. As the masses arched through the air, they quickly chilled on\r\nthe outside, and a hardened skin formed around the still hot and plastic\r\ncore. As their outsides cooled, gas pressure in their hot interiors\r\ncaused the bombs to expand slightly and their solidified outer skin to\r\ncrack. When they struck the ground, many of the bombs became flattened\r\non one side, but they were still plastic and sticky enough to remain\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nBombs can be found in two deposits that form the south bank of the White\r\nRiver about half a mile downstream from the White River campground. The\r\ndeposits are mudflows caused by the mixing of hot rock debris with the\r\nwater from melted snow and ice. As the mudflows moved down the valley\r\nfloor they must have resembled flowing masses of wet concrete.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier erupted several times between about 2,500 and 2,000 years\r\nago. During one of the first eruptions, a mass of hot ash, rock\r\nfragments, and breadcrust bombs avalanched down the side of the volcano\r\nand buried the floor of the South Puyallup River valley. Although this\r\nhot mass flowed like a wet mudflow, the temperature of the rock debris\r\nwas above 600°F. Thus, if any water had been present, it would have been\r\nin the form of steam. You can see the resulting deposit in cuts along\r\nthe West Side Road on both sides of the bridge across the South Puyallup\r\nRiver. Innumerable bombs have rolled from the cuts into the ditches\r\nbeside the road. A charcoal log found in the deposit had a radiocarbon\r\nage of about 2,500 years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A large breadcrust bomb enclosed in a mudflow deposit\r\nthat consists of a mixture of volcanic ash and rock fragments. The\r\noutcrop is on the south bank of the White River about half a mile\r\ndownstream from the White River campground. (Fig. 9)]\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of pumice were thrown out of the volcano at the same time\r\nas the bombs or soon after. The pumice covers most of the eastern half\r\nof the park, and fragments are scattered as far southwest as Pyramid\r\nPeak and as far northwest as Spray Park. This pumice, called layer C, is\r\nespecially thick and coarse at Yakima Park and Burroughs Mountain, where\r\nit lies at the ground surface (fig. 10). Here the light-brown layer is\r\n5-6 inches thick and consists of irregularly shaped pumice fragments as\r\nmuch as several inches across. Mingled with the pumice fragments are\r\nfist-sized chunks of light-gray rock that probably were simultaneously\r\nthrown out of the volcano by violent explosions. Some of these angular\r\nrocks were hurled as far as Shriner Peak, 11 miles east of Mount\r\nRainier’s summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pumice layer C, which consists of light-brown fragments,\r\nlies at the ground surface over much of the eastern part of the park.\r\n(Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nThe eruptive period was climaxed by the building of the volcano’s\r\npresent summit cone, which is at least 1,000 feet high and 1 mile across\r\nat its base. Although dwarfed by the tremendous bulk of Mount Rainier,\r\nit is a little larger than the cone of the well-known Mexican volcano\r\nParícutin that appeared in 1943 and erupted until 1952. Mount Rainier’s\r\npresent summit cone was built within a broad depression at the top of\r\nthe main volcano that had been formed nearly 4,000 years earlier (fig.\r\n11; see p. 40). The cone consists of a series of thin black lava flows,\r\nand its top is indented by two overlapping craters. Rocks around the\r\ncraters are still warm in places, and steam vents melt caves in the\r\nsummit icecap. The first climbers who reached the top of the mountain,\r\nin 1870, spent the night in one of these caves, as have many benighted\r\nclimbers since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The snow-covered lava cone lies in a depression 1¼ miles\r\nwide at the summit of the volcano. The cone was probably built about\r\n2,000 years ago. Liberty Cap is to the left and Point Success is to the\r\nright. The cliffs below and to the right of Liberty Cap enclose Sunset\r\nAmphitheater. (Fig. 11)]\r\n\r\nEven though the lava flows that formed the summit cone were relatively\r\nshort, their eruption greatly affected some valleys at the base of the\r\nvolcano. The hot lava melted snow and ice at the volcano’s summit,\r\ncausing floods that rushed down the east and south sides. When the\r\nfloods reached the valley floors, they picked up great quantities of\r\nloose rock debris and carried it downstream, sometimes forming mudflows.\r\nThe resulting flood and mudflow deposits raised the floors of the White\r\nand Nisqually River valleys as much as 80 feet higher than they are\r\ntoday. These valley floors, as well as several others, then became broad\r\nwastes of bare sand and gravel that extended beyond the park boundaries.\r\nLater, the rivers cut down to their present levels, but they left\r\nremnants of the flood and mudflow deposits as terraces or benches along\r\nthe sides of the valleys. You can camp on such a terrace in the\r\nNisqually River valley at the Cougar Rock campground. The White River\r\ncampground occupies a similar terrace in the White River valley.\r\n\r\nWhen did Mount Rainier erupt last? The most recent pumice eruption was\r\njust a little over a century ago. However, between 1820 and 1894,\r\nobservers reported at least 14 eruptions. Some of these may have been\r\njust large dust clouds, caused by rockfalls, that were mistaken for\r\nclouds of newly erupted ash. Other clouds may have been from genuine\r\neruptions that left no recognizable deposits. D. R. Mullineaux has found\r\nthat at least one eruption of that era did spread pumice over an area\r\neast of the volcano between Burroughs Mountain and Indian Bar to a\r\ndistance of at least 6 miles from the crater. Pieces of the pumice,\r\nlayer X, are light brownish gray and as large as 2 inches across. We\r\nfind only scattered fragments of the pumice, and nowhere are they in a\r\ncontinuous layer. Where the X pumice is directly on top of layer C, we\r\ncannot tell them apart. The best areas for us to study the younger\r\npumice, therefore, are glacial moraines formed within the last 150\r\nyears, because no pumice other than layer X is present on the moraines.\r\nFortunately, R. S. Sigafoos and E. L. Hendricks of the U.S. Geological\r\nSurvey have determined the ages of the moraines by counting the growth\r\nrings of trees on them. Their studies show that the pumice was erupted\r\nbetween about 1820 and 1854.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Frémont, an early explorer of the Oregon Territory,\r\nrecorded that Mount Rainier was erupting in November 1843, but his\r\njournals give no details. Others have reported eruptions in 1820, 1846,\r\n1854, and 1858. Pumice layer X probably was erupted during one or more\r\nof these times, but we do not know exactly when.\r\n\r\nAnd will Mount Rainier erupt again? We think that it will, but we now\r\nhave no sure way of predicting the time, the kind, or the scale of\r\nfuture eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Why Glaciers?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe frequently hear the question: “Why are there glaciers on Mount\r\nRainier?” A glacier forms wherever snowfall repeatedly exceeds melting\r\nover a period of years. Above 6,500-7,000 feet on Mount Rainier, more\r\nthan 50 feet of snow falls each winter, and not all of it melts before\r\nthe next winter. The survival of this snow from one year to the next\r\ndepends partly on the cooler temperatures at the higher altitudes, and\r\nperhaps also on the somewhat deeper snowfalls there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two ice streams meet to form the half-mile-wide Cowlitz\r\nGlacier. One heads on the flank of the volcano and the other (Ingraham\r\nGlacier) at the summit. The firnline is a short distance above the\r\njunction of the glaciers. The high bare embankment at the extreme right\r\nis a lateral moraine that was formed about 100 years ago when the\r\nglacier was thicker and about 1½ miles longer. (Fig. 12)]\r\n\r\n  LITTLE TAHOMA PEAK\r\n  MOUNT RAINIER\r\n  INGRAHAM GLACIER\r\n  COWLITZ GLACIER\r\n\r\nA line that marks the limit on a mountain above which snow persists from\r\none winter to the next is called the annual snowline, and this line on a\r\nglacier is called the firnline (fig. 12). Above the firnline, snow that\r\nfalls each year packs down and changes into glacier ice as air is slowly\r\nforced out of it. This part of the glacier is its accumulation area,\r\nwhere more snow falls each year than is lost by melting. Below the\r\nfirnline is the ablation area, where melting predominates. The firnline\r\non Mount Rainier’s glaciers has been well above 6,500 feet in recent\r\nyears. But some glaciers extend to altitudes below 5,000 feet—that is,\r\nfar down into the ablation area. They do this by slowly flowing\r\ndownhill. Solid ice flows by sliding on the hard bedrock under the\r\nglacier and by slipping along the innumerable surfaces within the ice\r\ncrystals that make up the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe rate of flow and the rate of ablation govern the distance a glacier\r\nextends down into the ablation zone. If these rates remain fairly\r\nconstant, the glacier will be in balance and its size will be about the\r\nsame from year to year. But if changing weather patterns affect the\r\nrates of ablation or accumulation, or both, the glacier will either\r\nbecome smaller or grow larger. The change you are most likely to notice\r\nis in the position of the glacier’s terminus, which may either recede or\r\nadvance, but precise measurements of the upper reaches of a glacier also\r\nshow volume changes there, some of which may not affect the glacier’s\r\nterminus for many years, if ever.\r\n\r\nCrevasses are a glacier’s most awesome features and are a constant\r\nhazard for climbers. They form where adjacent parts of a glacier are\r\nmoving at different speeds. Some of Mount Rainier’s glaciers may be\r\nflowing at a speed of several thousand feet per year along their centers\r\nbut at a much slower rate along their margins. This unequal rate of flow\r\nproduces stresses in the ice that cause it to break. Groups of crevasses\r\noften form where the glacier flows over a steep place in its bed. The\r\nice moves faster here, and pulls apart, and a crevasse is formed.\r\nAlthough a large crevasse may seem to be bottomless to the observer,\r\nmost crevasses are less than 100 feet deep because ice pressure tends to\r\nclose the open spaces in the ice below that depth.[3]\r\n\r\nIce covers 37 square miles of the park today. Individual glaciers that\r\nmake up this ice blanket are placed into three groups, depending on\r\ntheir place of origin. Those of one group originate at the volcano’s\r\nsummit and flow far down the valleys that radiate from the cone. Most of\r\nthe snow that nourishes these glaciers probably falls on them at\r\naltitudes well below the summit. The largest examples of the group are\r\nthe Emmons, Nisqually, and Tahoma Glaciers.\r\n\r\nGlaciers of the second group originate on the flanks of the volcano,\r\nmostly at altitudes between 7,000 and 10,000 feet. This group is\r\nrepresented by the South Tahoma, Carbon, and Inter Glaciers. Glaciers of\r\nthe third group are on north-facing slopes in the mountains around Mount\r\nRainier. They are mostly at altitudes of about 6,000 feet, and they owe\r\ntheir existence to locations well protected from solar heat. Glaciers\r\nrepresenting this group are the Unicorn and Pinnacle Glaciers in the\r\nTatoosh Range, a small unnamed glacier near the west end of Burroughs\r\nMountain, and the somewhat larger Sarvent Glaciers east of Mount\r\nRainier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Work Habits of Glaciers\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaciers are extremely capable workers. Their work includes erosion,\r\ntransportation, and deposition. The smoothed and grooved bedrock at Box\r\nCanyon and at many points along the trail to the ice caves near Paradise\r\nPark shows erosion of rock by glacier ice. Rock fragments carried by\r\nglaciers cut grooves in the hard bedrock and polish its surface\r\n(fig. 13). Although any one rock fragment might scrape away only 1\r\nmillimeter of rock along a single groove, the total effect is great when\r\nmultiplied by countless thousands of similar fragments rasping a bedrock\r\nsurface for hundreds or thousands of years. Glacier ice may also break\r\nchunks of rock loose as it overrides them and may even plow up sections\r\nof softer rocks.\r\n\r\nGlaciers transport not only the rocks that they quarry and scrape from\r\ntheir beds but also, more conspicuously, those that fall onto their\r\nsurfaces from nearby cliffs. These falling rocks range in size from tiny\r\nparticles to individual masses that weigh tens of thousands of tons,\r\nlike those that fell onto Emmons Glacier from Little Tahoma Peak in\r\n1963. (See p. 35.)\r\n\r\nA glacier deposits most rock debris at its terminus. The steep snout of\r\nany major glacier is a dangerous place to approach closely because rock\r\ndebris almost constantly falls, rolls, and slides down the melting ice\r\nfaces. Much of this debris collects at the ice margin, and if the margin\r\nstays in one place long enough a ridge-shaped end moraine of rock debris\r\nforms along the ice front (fig. 14). If such a moraine forms across the\r\nfront of a glacier at its farthest advance it is called a terminal\r\nmoraine. End moraines that form as the ice recedes are called\r\nrecessional moraines (fig. 15). Ridges of rock debris that form along\r\nthe sides of a glacier are called lateral moraines (fig. 12).\r\n\r\nSome recent moraines of modern glaciers are only a few feet away from\r\nthe present ice margin; others, formed thousands of years ago during the\r\nmost recent major glaciation, are on ridgetops and valley sides or\r\nfloors miles away from modern glaciers. By examining the shape and\r\nlocation of these moraines, we can reconstruct the size and character of\r\npast glaciers, as we will see in the next section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glacier-smoothed and grooved rock along the Wonderland\r\nTrail between Indian Bar and Panhandle Gap. (Fig. 13)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A muddy grayish-blue lake several hundred feet long lies\r\nbehind a small horseshoe-shaped end moraine of Flett Glacier, on the\r\nnorthwest side of Mount Rainier. The glacier is mostly out of view to\r\nthe left. (Fig. 14)]\r\n\r\nGlaciers erode, transport, and deposit huge quantities of rock debris.\r\nSo do their coworkers, the melt-water streams. These turbulent streams\r\nflow from tunnels beneath every glacier, and their degree of muddiness\r\nroughly shows how active the glacier is. Glaciers that move very slowly,\r\nor that are stagnant, produce relatively clear melt water because they\r\nare not actively eroding bedrock. In contrast, streams of muddy water\r\nthat look like chocolate milk often come from very active or “live”\r\nglaciers. These streams carry rock debris ranging from flour-size\r\nparticles to large boulders. You can sense the carrying power of this\r\nswiftly moving water on warm summer days, when large cobbles and\r\nboulders are bumping along in a stream swollen by rapid glacier melting.\r\nAlthough you can rarely see these boulders, you can hear their constant\r\nlow thunder. Their repeated impacts on other boulders in the streambed\r\nwill vibrate the nearby streambanks beneath your feet. Hikers often find\r\nthat a melt-water stream safe to cross in the early morning of a warm\r\nsummer day is an impassable torrent at the same spot by early afternoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four curved recessional moraines are spread over a\r\ndistance of 2,000 feet on the valley floor of Fryingpan Creek. They were\r\nformed within the last few hundred years as Fryingpan Glacier lost\r\nvolume and shrank back toward its present position above a line of\r\ncliffs. (Fig. 15)]\r\n\r\nA melt-water stream generally deposits coarse material wherever the\r\nslope of the valley floor decreases and the stream loses some of its\r\nvelocity and carrying power. Only a flood may move the boulders farther\r\ndownstream. However, the current carries fine material far downstream to\r\ndeposit it in lakes, in Puget Sound, or in the Pacific Ocean. The\r\nPuyallup River, for example, is still very muddy where it enters Puget\r\nSound at Tacoma, more than 40 miles from its source in the glaciers on\r\nMount Rainier.\r\n\r\nDuring the last glaciation, when glaciers were much larger than they are\r\nnow, melt-water streams carrying great quantities of sand and gravel\r\nbuilt valley floors up to levels tens of feet higher than they are\r\ntoday. Later, as the glaciers grew smaller, the rivers cut down into\r\ntheir valley floors and remnants of the sand and gravel deposits were\r\nleft standing in benches or terraces along the sides of the valleys. You\r\ncan see a good example of such a terrace in the Nisqually River valley\r\nbeyond Ashford, which is 5 miles west of the park. You cross it on the\r\nhighway that leads to the park. Cuts beneath the terrace reveal deposits\r\nof sand, cobbles, and boulders that look the same as those deposits\r\nbeing formed today by melt-water streams. The terrace west of Ashford\r\nwas formed a little more than 15,000 years ago, when a glacier extended\r\ndown the Nisqually River valley to the vicinity of Ashford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Yesterday’s Glaciers\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Rainier’s great sprawling cone would seem incomplete without the\r\nglistening sheets of ice that descend its flanks. We have reason to\r\nbelieve that the volcano has borne glaciers ever since its\r\norigin—sometimes smaller than now, at other times vastly larger. Mount\r\nRainier probably started to grow during the middle part of the\r\nPleistocene Epoch, or Ice Age, which began more than 1 million years\r\nago, but glaciers had covered this part of the mountains even before the\r\nvolcano appeared. Masses of rock debris formed by ancient glaciers occur\r\nbeneath lava flows from Mount Rainier on the west side of Mazama Ridge\r\njust upslope from Narada Falls, on the north side of Glacier Basin, and\r\nat a few other places in the park.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier may have reached its present size by about 75,000 years\r\nago. Since that time great icefields and glaciers have formed at least\r\nthree times on the slopes of the volcano and in the nearby mountains.\r\nDuring the first two glaciations, ice completely buried the flanks of\r\nthe volcano and the surrounding mountains, except for the very highest\r\nridges and peaks. These great ice masses slowly flowed down all the\r\nvalleys that head at Mount Rainier. The glacier in the Cowlitz River\r\nvalley, for example, extended 65 miles from the volcano and reached a\r\npoint about 33 miles west of the community of Randle. Deposits of the\r\nyounger of these two glacial episodes can be seen in cuts along the\r\nMowich Lake Road for a distance of about 1½ miles inside the park\r\nboundary. The glacial deposits were originally more widespread, but in\r\nmost of the park they have been removed by erosion or covered by the\r\ndeposits of yet younger glaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extent of glaciers in the Cascade Range near Mount\r\nRainier between about 15,000 and 25,000 years ago. Arrows show the\r\ndirection of ice movement; solid black represents modern glaciers on\r\nMount Rainier. (Fig. 16)]\r\n\r\nDuring the most recent major glaciation of the park, which lasted from\r\nroughly 25,000 to 10,000 years ago, ice again sheathed the slopes of the\r\nvolcano, but glaciers in the nearby mountains were smaller than before.\r\nMost of the glaciers originated at the valley heads, where they gouged\r\nout countless bowl-shaped bedrock basins called cirques. Many of the\r\nbasins held lakes after the glaciers disappeared. (See frontispiece.)\r\nHikers on the trail to the Paradise ice caves cross the floor of a\r\ntypical cirque at the head of Paradise Valley. From the Sunrise Visitor\r\nCenter at Yakima Park you can walk a short distance to a point along the\r\ncrest of the Sourdough Mountains and stand at the rim of a deep\r\nnorth-facing cirque. Ice originating in this cirque and in the cirques\r\nadjacent to it moved northward down the valley of Huckleberry Creek at\r\nleast as far as the park’s north boundary (fig. 16).\r\n\r\nThese glaciers left most valley walls in the park covered with rock\r\ndebris. Lateral moraines can be seen along the highway at and just east\r\nof Ricksecker Point (fig. 17). Other glacial deposits are especially\r\nwell displayed in roadcuts along the north wall of the White River\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lateral moraine of rock debris at Ricksecker Point. It\r\nwas formed by Nisqually Glacier when the glacier was at least 1,000 feet\r\nthick and about 15 miles longer than it is today. (Fig. 17)]\r\n\r\nA little more than 15,000 years ago the long glaciers began to shrink\r\nand recede. By 11,000 years ago there was only about as much ice on\r\nMount Rainier as there has been within the last century. Then, during a\r\nshort period of renewed glacier growth, most glaciers expanded short\r\ndistances and new ones appeared in cirques from which ice had\r\ndisappeared only a short time before. In some of these cirques so much\r\nrock debris was being dislodged from surrounding cliffs by repeated\r\nfreeze and thaw that a rock glacier, consisting mostly of rock fragments\r\nbound together by ice, was formed. A trail to the Huckleberry Creek\r\nvalley crosses hummocky rock debris left by such a rock glacier in a\r\ncirque on the southeast side of Mount Fremont. A larger rock-glacier\r\ndeposit lies about 2 miles north of Sunrise Point in an east-facing\r\ncirque between The Palisades and Hidden Lake (fig. 18).\r\n\r\nIn other cirques, where the proportion of ice to rock debris was\r\ngreater, the glacier transported the debris a short distance forward and\r\nbuilt a terminal moraine. You can see particularly good examples of\r\nmoraines formed about 11,000 years ago near Tipsoo Lake, where the pond\r\nsoutheast of the lake is dammed by a moraine, and at Mystic Lake. The\r\nice that formed the terminal moraine at Mystic Lake was a tongue of\r\nCarbon Glacier.\r\n\r\nIn some places the orientation or altitude of the cirque did not permit\r\nenough snow to accumulate to form a glacier but just enough to create a\r\npermanent snowbank. Rock debris that fell from the surrounding cliffs\r\nrolled down these snowbanks and formed low ridges at their toes. Such a\r\nridge is called a protalus rampart because it is found just in front of\r\nthe apron of rock fragments, called talus, that lies beneath cliffs. A\r\ntrail at Sunrise Point leads to protalus ramparts along the north side\r\nof Sunrise Ridge.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 10,000 years, glaciers have been very small by\r\ncomparison with the great ice mantles that overwhelmed the park earlier.\r\nHowever, glaciers have grown larger at least twice just within the last\r\n3,000 years. During both of these periods most glaciers were slightly\r\nlarger than they are today, and ice occupied most cirques at altitudes\r\nabove 6,500 feet—even some that are now free of ice. The most recent\r\ntime of extensive glacier growth began at least 800 years ago, and\r\nvarious glaciers in the park reached their maximum size between the\r\nmid-14th century and the mid-19th century. Oddly enough, even though all\r\nthe glaciers headed on Mount Rainier, they did not all attain their\r\nmaximum size simultaneously. The largest terminal moraine of this most\r\nrecent glacial period was built by Emmons Glacier in the White River\r\nvalley (fig. 19). It is now largely forested, and cores taken from the\r\ntrees with a special boring tool that does not harm the tree show ages\r\nindicating that the moraine was stable enough to permit seedlings to\r\nsurvive on it by the mid-17th century. A similar but smaller terminal\r\nmoraine built by Cowlitz Glacier has trees on it that started to grow in\r\nthe mid-14th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rock-glacier deposit (light-gray rubble beyond the brown\r\nslopes in the foreground) at The Palisades, which was formed about\r\n11,000 years ago when the climate was colder than it is today. Rocks\r\nfell from the cliffs in such great quantity that a small glacier in\r\nfront of the cliffs consisted of more rock debris than ice. The melting\r\nof the ice left a mass of broken rock several hundred feet thick which\r\ncovers about 80 acres. (Fig. 18)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The hummocky end moraine at the left still had blocks of\r\nice buried in it when this picture was taken in 1954. The front of\r\nEmmons Glacier was near the left edge of the bare moraine in about 1900.\r\nNow the glacier ends 1 mile farther upvalley at the upper right. The\r\nvalley floor and moraine were buried by an avalanche of rock debris from\r\nLittle Tahoma Peak in 1963. (Fig. 19)]\r\n\r\nNearly all the glaciers gradually decreased in size after the mid-18th\r\ncentury. Although the shrinkage was sometimes interrupted by short\r\nperiods of renewed glacier growth, by 1950 the glaciers at Mount Rainier\r\ncovered only about two-thirds of the area that had been buried by ice\r\nonly a century before. The overall loss of volume by Rainier’s glaciers,\r\nas well as those elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, was slowed or\r\nhalted by slightly cooler temperatures and higher precipitation starting\r\nin the mid-1940’s. Volume increases in their upper reaches caused the\r\nlarger glaciers to grow from year to year, and since the early 1950’s\r\nthe terminuses of many glaciers have been advancing. This renewed growth\r\nof glaciers is not unique at Mount Rainier—similar changes have been\r\nobserved at other glaciers in the Cascade Range and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Landslides and Mudflows—Past, Present, and Future\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the most effective means of erosion at Mount Rainier are\r\nlandslides and mudflows. Erosion of this kind is sometimes spectacular.\r\nWithin an interval of only minutes or a few hours huge masses of rock\r\nmay fall, slide, or flow off the volcano and move far downvalley.\r\n\r\nLarge landslides have occurred at many other places in the park—one in\r\nthe area northeast of Mount Rainier is so conspicuous that its source\r\nhas been named Slide Mountain. The ragged scar left by another slide\r\nnear Grand Park is aptly called Scarface. You cross a slide on the\r\nMather Memorial Parkway (U.S. Highway 410) just north of Cayuse Pass.\r\nBroken and jumbled rock debris of many sizes borders both sides of the\r\nhighway there. This landslide broke loose in rocks of the Ohanapecosh\r\nFormation, slid downslope to the bottom of the valley, and dammed\r\nKlickitat Creek to form Ghost Lake. Rocks have also slid downslope on\r\nthe west side of Backbone Ridge and on the east side of the Ohanapecosh\r\nRiver valley a short distance north of Ohanapecosh campground. The slide\r\non Backbone Ridge is still slowly moving today. Another slide moves a\r\nfew inches each year on the west side of the Nisqually River valley\r\nabout 1 mile northwest of the visitor center at Paradise Park. You can\r\nrecognize the slide by a jagged horizontal crack 1,000 feet long at its\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nA far more spectacular variety of landslide occurs when a mass of rock\r\ndrops from a cliff to form a rockfall. The largest rockfalls on Mount\r\nRainier in historic time occurred in December 1963 on the east flank.\r\nMasses of rock hundreds of feet across fell repeatedly from the steep\r\nnorth face of Little Tahoma Peak onto Emmons Glacier. The rock masses\r\nshattered into dust and countless fragments, fanned out across the\r\nglacier, then avalanched down the steep ice surface at tremendous speed.\r\nWhen the avalanches reached the end of the glacier they shot out into\r\nspace as sheets of rock debris. As these hurtling sheets settled toward\r\nthe valley floor, a cushion of compressed air formed beneath them,\r\ncomparable to the air cushion that momentarily buoys up a sheet of\r\nplywood that is dropped onto a flat surface. Air that was trapped\r\nbeneath these speeding avalanches reduced friction and permitted one of\r\nthe avalanches to move almost 2 miles beyond the end of the glacier.\r\nThis avalanche passed completely over a small wooden gage house about 5\r\nfeet high on the valley floor without damaging it, then ran headlong\r\ninto the north base of Goat Island Mountain where it scraped away trees\r\nand bushes. A later avalanche stopped just short of the gage house, and\r\nwind that was expelled from beneath the rock debris blasted the\r\nstill-undamaged house several hundred feet forward. It now rests in the\r\nscar left by the earlier avalanche on the side of Goat Island Mountain.\r\n\r\nAt least seven rockfalls and avalanches descended from Little Tahoma\r\nPeak, separated perhaps by only minutes or hours. The reddish-gray\r\nmasses of broken and pulverized rock—some spread helter-skelter, some\r\npiled in long sharp-crested ridges—now lie on the valley floor between\r\nthe White River campground and Emmons Glacier (fig. 20).\r\n\r\nThe rockfalls might have been caused by a steam explosion near the base\r\nof Little Tahoma Peak. Steam jets and small explosions are not unusual\r\nphenomena at Mount Rainier, although they never have had such dramatic\r\neffects in historic time.\r\n\r\nIncredibly larger avalanches of rock fell repeatedly from the sides of\r\nMount Rainier during prehistoric time. One such avalanche originated\r\nnear the summit of the volcano and blanketed Paradise Park and Paradise\r\nValley with a yellowish-orange mixture of clay and rocks sometime\r\nbetween 5,800 and 6,600 years ago. You can see this avalanche deposit in\r\nshallow cuts along trails and roads in the Paradise area. Huge blocks of\r\nrock that came down with the avalanche are scattered in the meadows of\r\nParadise Park between the visitor center and Panorama Point. Although\r\nthe deposit is now less than 15 feet thick in most places, the mass that\r\nflowed down Paradise Valley must have been 600 feet thick, because we\r\ncan find remnants of it on top of Mazama Ridge. A tongue of the wet mass\r\nflowed through a low saddle near the south end of Mazama Ridge and\r\nextended into the basin now occupied by the Reflection Lakes. You can\r\nsee the yellowish-orange deposit in the first roadcut west of the lakes,\r\nwhere it lies on top of gray glacial deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Avalanche deposits in the White River valley. The\r\nrockfalls and avalanches from Little Tahoma Peak formed a mass of\r\nreddish-gray rock debris that contrasts with the darker gray glacial\r\ndebris deposited by Emmons Glacier within the last century. The\r\navalanche deposits are about 1,500 feet across at their widest point.\r\n(Fig. 20)]\r\n\r\nThe avalanche probably was wet when it crossed the Paradise area, and\r\nthe moisture in it may have already been present in the rocks in which\r\nthe avalanche originated. The mass was fluid enough to move down the\r\nParadise and Nisqually River valleys as a mudflow hundreds of feet\r\nthick, and the resulting deposits extend at least 18 miles downstream\r\nfrom the volcano. The volume of rock that slid off to produce the\r\nmudflow may have been as much as 100 million cubic yards—or roughly\r\nenough to cover a 1-mile-square area to a depth of 100 feet.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time as the Paradise avalanche and mudflow occurred, a\r\ntremendous rock mass also slid off the east side of the volcano in the\r\narea between Steamboat Prow and Little Tahoma Peak. This slide formed a\r\nmudflow on the floor of the White River valley that was several hundred\r\nfeet deep at the north boundary of the park and that extended at least\r\n30 miles beyond the base of the volcano. The most remarkable feature of\r\nthe deposit left by this mudflow is its surface, which is dotted with\r\nscores of mounds 5-35 feet high and as much as several hundred feet in\r\ndiameter. These mounds have cores of huge rocks which are similar in\r\nsize to those scattered on the surface of the avalanche deposits from\r\nLittle Tahoma Peak. You can see the mounds best in an area which is a\r\nfew miles north of the park boundary, west of the White River, and which\r\ncan be reached by the Huckleberry Creek Forest Road. The total volume of\r\nthis mudflow deposit may be as much as one-fifth of a cubic mile.\r\n\r\nThese great landslides and mudflows were followed shortly by another\r\nwhose size surpassed that of anything before or since. This was the\r\nremarkable Osceola Mudflow, which streamed down the valleys of the White\r\nRiver and West Fork about 5,800 years ago. When these great rivers of\r\nmud joined in the White River valley, they formed an even larger mudflow\r\nwhich swiftly flowed downvalley for a distance of 15 miles and then\r\nspread beyond the Cascade mountain front into the Puget Sound lowland.\r\nThere the mudflow submerged a total area of more than 100 square miles\r\nto depths as great as 70 feet and buried the sites of the present towns\r\nof Enumclaw and Buckley. One tongue of it even flowed into an arm of\r\nPuget Sound, south of Seattle, that has since been filled with river\r\ndeposits to form the fertile valley occupied by the towns of Kent,\r\nAuburn, Sumner, and Puyallup.\r\n\r\nThe Osceola Mudflow is remarkable in that it affected areas so far from\r\nits place of origin. This long distance of travel was due to its great\r\nvolume, which we estimate to have been more than half a cubic mile, and\r\nto the abundance of slippery clay in it. The clay had been formed by the\r\nalteration of rocks in the volcano by hot gases and solutions over many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The northeast flank of Mount Rainier. A remnant of the\r\nOsceola Mudflow lies at the summit of Steamboat Prow in the center. Two\r\nand one-half miles to the left is Little Tahoma Peak, from whose steep\r\nnorth face at least seven large masses of rock fell in 1963. Mount Adams\r\nvolcano can be seen at the left, and Mount Hood, Oregon, in the far\r\ndistance. (Fig. 21)]\r\n\r\nWhere did the Osceola Mudflow originate on the volcano? This we must\r\ndeduce from several lines of evidence. The mudflow occurred so long ago\r\nthat there is no historical record, and volcanic events since that time\r\nhave covered up part of the scar it left on the volcano. Remnants of the\r\nOsceola Mudflow veneer the sides and ridges of Glacier Basin, and a\r\nsmall amount of it is even preserved at the top of Steamboat Prow, at an\r\naltitude of 9,700 feet (fig. 21). This distribution tells us that the\r\nslides responsible for the mudflow originated somewhere on the volcano\r\nabove Steamboat Prow. But now there is no great chasm in the side of the\r\nvolcano large enough to have provided a source of the mudflow; so we\r\nmust consider a former summit of the volcano itself as a possible\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nI. C. Russell, one of the first geologists to study Mount Rainier, wrote\r\nin 1896 that the present summit of the volcano consists of a small lava\r\ncone. Enclosing this cone is a broad depression whose rim is partly\r\npreserved at Gibraltar Rock, Point Success, and Liberty Cap (fig. 11).\r\nHigh points on the rim indicate that the former summit of the volcano\r\nabove an altitude of about 14,000 feet was removed in some way. The\r\ndestruction of the old summit, which may have reached a height of 16,000\r\nfeet, left a broad east-facing depression in the top of the volcano\r\nbetween Gibraltar Rock and Russell Cliff. The depression has since been\r\nmostly filled by the recent lava cone. You can see these features best\r\nfrom high points east of the mountain.\r\n\r\nOur best explanation of how the former top of the volcano was removed\r\nalso solves the problem of finding an adequate source of material for\r\nthe Osceola Mudflow. Before 5,800 years ago, the topmost part of Mount\r\nRainier probably consisted of rock that had been weakened by hot\r\nvolcanic fumes and solutions and partly converted to clay. Then, this\r\nmass of weak rock was jostled off or pushed off by a volcanic explosion\r\nand slid down the northeast side of the volcano. One or more of these\r\nmighty avalanches of moist clay and rock resulted in the Osceola\r\nMudflow.\r\n\r\nLarge avalanches have also occurred many times during the last 3,000\r\nyears on the west side of the volcano. Sunset Amphitheater (fig. 11) is\r\npart of the large scar left by them. About 2,800 years ago one of these\r\navalanches created a mudflow in the valleys of the South Puyallup River\r\nand Tahoma Creek that was temporarily deep enough to submerge Round Pass\r\n(on the West Side Road) to a depth of nearly 400 feet. This is\r\nespecially remarkable when we see that Round Pass itself is 600-700 feet\r\nabove the nearby valley floors. Another deep mudflow, started by an\r\navalanche at Sunset Amphitheater, moved down the Puyallup River valley\r\nabout 600 years ago and buried the site of the present town of Orting in\r\nthe Puget Sound lowland under 15 feet of mud and rock.\r\n\r\nTable 2.—_Summary of important geologic events in the history of Mount\r\nRainier National Park_\r\n\r\n   Geologic      Years ago    Geologic events in the area of the park\r\n   time scale\r\n\r\n “Postglacial”                Present summit cone of Mount Rainier\r\n                                probably was built about 2,000 years\r\n                                ago. The last known pumice eruption\r\n                                occurred between 1820 and 1854.\r\n                              Glaciers started to grow and advance\r\n                                about 3,000 years ago. Maximum\r\n                                extents were reached about 1850 A.D.\r\n                                From then until about 1955, glaciers\r\n                                were receding; now they are in\r\n                                balance or advancing.\r\n                              Huge masses of rock have slid from the\r\n                                volcano repeatedly during the last\r\n                                10,000 years.

Almost any cliff\r\non the volcano can produce a large rockfall, but which cliff will\r\ncollapse next, or when, cannot be predicted. Should the volcano again\r\nbecome active, earthquakes and volcanic explosions would trigger\r\navalanches and mudflows that would rush down the mountain. Molten rock\r\nwould melt snow and ice at the volcano’s summit and send floods of water\r\ndown the volcano’s flanks. These indirect effects of an eruption would\r\nbe much more hazardous than lava flows and pumice, if eruptions are on a\r\nscale similar to that of the past 10,000 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Volcano’s Future?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn active volcano changes continually. Repeated eruptions build the cone\r\nby piling one lava flow on top of others, or on top of other volcanic\r\nformations. Simultaneously, the combined processes of erosion wear the\r\nvolcano down. The relative importance of the two processes—one building,\r\nthe other destroying—is reflected in the volcano’s shape. The scarred\r\nand deeply gouged sides of Rainier’s cone show that erosion has been\r\ndominant here for a long time. Is Mount Rainier now doomed to continued\r\npiecemeal destruction until the lofty cone is reduced to a featureless\r\nmound? Will future eruptions of lava restore some of the volcano’s bulk?\r\nOr will the volcano erupt violently some day, and then collapse as did\r\nMount Mazama to form the deep basin of Crater Lake? The answers may not\r\nbe known for centuries—or they may appear tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Further Reading in Geology\r\n\r\n\r\nCrandell, D.
