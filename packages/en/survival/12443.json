INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nThe five main fibres used for ordinary textile purposes are cotton,\r\nflax, jute, silk and wool; in this group jute has been considered in\r\ngeneral as being of the least value, not only in regard to price,\r\nbut also in regard to utility. It is only under phenomenal\r\nconditions which arise from a great upheaval such as that which took\r\nplace during the world's great war from 1914 onwards that, from a\r\ncommercial point of view, the extreme importance of the jute fibre\r\nand its products are fully realized. Millions of sand bags were made\r\nfrom the year 1914 to the year 1918 solely for military purposes,\r\nwhile huge quantities of jute cloth were utilized as the covering\r\nmaterial for food stuffs of various kinds, thus liberating the other\r\ntextile fibres and cloth for equally important purposes. It is on\r\nrecord that in one short period of fourteen days, 150,000,000\r\nsand-bags were collected, packed and despatched from Dundee to be\r\nused as protective elements in various ways and seats of conflict.\r\n\r\nA glance into the records of the textile industries will reveal the\r\nfact that the jute fibre was practically unknown in these islands a\r\nhundred years ago. Unsuccessful attempts were certainly made to\r\nimport the fibre into Great Britain in the latter part of the 18th\r\ncentury, and it has been used in India for centuries in the making\r\nof cord, twine and coarse fabrics, because the fibre is indigenous\r\nto that country. And since all the manufacturing methods there, for\r\na considerable time were manual ones, the industry--if such it could\r\nbe called--moved along slowly, providing employment only for the\r\nneeds of a small section of the community on the Eastern shores.\r\n\r\nThe first small imports of jute fibre were due to the instigation of\r\nDr. Roxburgh and the East India Company, but it was only after\r\nrepeated requests that any attempt was made to utilize the samples\r\nof jute for practical experiments The fibre was so unlike any of the\r\nexisting staples that those interested in textiles were not anxious\r\nto experiment with it, but ultimately they were persuaded to do so;\r\nthese persistent requests for trials, and the interest which was\r\nfinally aroused, formed the nucleus of the existing important jute\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nApart from the above-mentioned efforts, the introduction of the jute\r\nfibre into Great Britain was delayed until 1822, when the first\r\nsmall consignment reached Dundee--now the Western home of the jute\r\nindustry. This quantity was imported into this country with the\r\nspecial object of having it treated by mechanical means, much in the\r\nsame way as flax fibre was being treated. At this period Dundee was\r\na comparatively important textile centre in regard to the spinning\r\nand weaving of flax and hemp; it was, in consequence, only natural\r\nthat the longer, but otherwise apparently similar and coarser, jute\r\nfibre should be submitted to the machinery in vogue for the\r\npreparation and spinning of flax and hemp. When we say similar, we\r\nmean in general appearance; it is now well-known that there is a\r\nconsiderable difference between jute fibre and those of hemp and flax,\r\nand hence the modifications in preparation which had ultimately to\r\nbe introduced to enable the jute fibre to be successfully treated.\r\nThese modifications shall be discussed at a later stage.\r\n\r\nIt might be stated that while only 368 cwt. of jute fibre was\r\nreported as being shipped from Calcutta to this country in 1828, the\r\nimports gradually increased as time passed on. The yarns which were\r\nmade from the fibre were heavier or thicker than those in demand for\r\nthe usual types of cloth, and it was desirable that other types of\r\ncloth should be introduced so that these yarns could be utilized.\r\nAbout the year 1838, representatives of the Dutch Government placed\r\ncomparatively large orders with the manufacturers for jute bags to\r\nbe used for carrying the crop of coffee beans from their West Indian\r\npossessions. The subsequent rapid growth of the industry, and the\r\ndemand for newer types of cloth, are perhaps due more to the above\r\nfortunate experiment than to any other circumstance.\r\n\r\nBy the year or season 1850-51, the British imports of jute fibre had\r\nincreased to over 28,000 tons, and they reached 46,000 tons in the\r\nseason 1860-61. Attention meanwhile had been directed to the\r\npossibility of manufacturing jute goods by machinery in India--the\r\nseat of the cultivation and growth of the fibre. At least such a\r\nprobability was anticipated, for in the year 1858 a small\r\nconsignment of machinery was despatched to Calcutta, and an attempt\r\nmade to produce the gunny bags which were typical of the Indian\r\nnative industry.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the more or less unorganized hand\r\nlabour and the essential organization of modern mills and factories\r\nsoon became apparent, for in the first place it was difficult to\r\ninduce the natives to remain inside the works during the period of\r\ntraining, and equally difficult to keep the trained operatives\r\nconstantly employed. Monetary affairs induced them to leave the\r\nmills and factories for their more usual mode of living in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these difficulties, however, the industry grew in\r\nIndia as well as in Dundee. For several years before the war, the\r\nquantity of raw jute fibre brought to Dundee and other British ports\r\namounted to 200,000 tons. During the same period preceding the war,\r\nnearly 1,000,000 tons were exported to various countries, while the\r\nIndian annual consumption--due jointly to the home industry and the\r\nmills in the vicinity of Calcutta--reached the same huge total of\r\none million tons.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the jute industry in several parts of the world, and\r\nconsequently its gradually increasing importance in regard to the\r\nproduction of yarns and cloth for various purposes, enables it to be\r\nranked as one of the important industries in the textile group, and\r\none which may perhaps attain a much more important position in the\r\nnear future amongst our national manufacturing processes. As a\r\nmatter of fact, at the present time, huge extensions are\r\ncontemplated and actually taking place in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.  CULTIVATION\r\n\r\n_Botanical and Physical Features of the Plant_. Jute fibre is\r\nobtained from two varieties of plants which appear to differ only in\r\nthe shape of the fruit or seed vessel. Thus, the fruit of the\r\nvariety _Corchorus Capsularis_ is enclosed in a capsule of\r\napproximately circular section, whereas the fruit of the variety\r\n_Corchorus Olitorius_ is contained in a pod. Both belong to the\r\norder _Tiliacea_, and are annuals cultivated mostly in Bengal and\r\nAssam.\r\n\r\nOther varieties are recorded, e.g. the _Corchorus Japonicus_ of Japan,\r\nand the _Corchorus Mompoxensis_ used in Panama for making a kind of\r\ntea, while one variety of jute plant is referred to in the book of\r\njob as the Jew's Mallow; this variety _C. Olitorius_, has been used\r\nin the East from time immemorial as a pot herb.\r\n\r\nThe two main varieties _C. Capsularis_ and _C. Olilorius_ are\r\ncultivated in Bengal for the production of fibre, while for seed\r\npurposes, large tracts of land are cultivated in Assam, and the\r\nseeds exported for use principally in Mymensingh and Dacca.\r\n\r\nThe above two varieties of the jute plant vary in height from 5 to\r\n15 feet, and, in a normal season, reach maturity in about four\r\nmonths from the time of sowing. In some districts the stems of jute\r\nplants are sometimes rather dark in colour, but, in general, they are\r\ngreen or pink, and straight with a tendency to branch. The leaves\r\nare alternate on the stems, 4 to 5 inches in length, and about 1-1/2\r\ninches in breadth with serrated edges. Pale yellow flowers spring\r\nfrom the axil (axilla) of the leaves, and there is an abundance of\r\nsmall seeds in the fruit which, as mentioned, is characteristic of\r\nthe variety.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts have been made to cultivate jute plants in\r\nvarious parts of the world, the results seem to indicate that the\r\nnecessary conditions for the successful cultivation of them are\r\ncompletely fulfilled only in the Bengal area, and the geographical\r\nposition of this province is mainly responsible for these conditions.\r\nOn referring to a map of India, it will be seen that Bengal is\r\ndirectly north of the bay of that name, and is bounded on the north\r\nby the great Himalayan mountains.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter period when the prevailing winds are from the north,\r\nlarge areas of the mountainous regions are covered with snow, but\r\nwhen the winds change and come from the south, and particularly\r\nduring the warmer weather, the moist warm air raises the general\r\ntemperature and also melts much of the snow on the mountain tracts.\r\nThe rain and melted snow swell the two great rivers on the east and\r\nwest of Bengal--the Patna and the Brahmaputra--and the tremendous\r\nvolume of water carries down decayed vegetable and animal matter\r\nwhich is ultimately spread on the flat areas of Bengal as alluvial\r\ndeposits, and thus provides an ideal layer of soil for the\r\npropagation of the jute plants.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of land for the growing of jute plants is most\r\nextensively conducted in the centres bordering on the courses of the\r\nrivers, and particularly in Mymensingh, Dacca, Hooghly and Pabna,\r\nand while 90 per cent. of the fibre is produced in Bengal, Orissa\r\nand Bihar, there is 10 per cent. produced outside these areas.\r\n\r\nThe _Corchorus Capsularis_ variety is usually cultivated in the\r\nhigher and richer soils, while the _Corchorus Olitorius_ variety is\r\nmost suited for the lower-lying alluvial soils, and to the districts\r\nwhere the rainfall is irregular; indeed, the _C. Olitorius_ may be\r\ngrown in certain other districts of India which appear quite\r\nunsuitable for the _C. Capsularis_.\r\n\r\nThe farming operations in India are rather simple when compared with\r\nthe corresponding operations in this country; there is evidently not\r\nthe same necessity for extensive working of the Indian soil as there\r\nis for the heavier lands; another reason for the primitive Eastern\r\nmethods may be the absence of horses.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs are made of wood and faced with iron. Bullocks, in teams\r\nof two or more, are harnessed to the plough as shown in Fig. 1 where\r\na field is being ploughed as a preliminary process in jute\r\ncultivation. The bullocks draw the plough in much the same way as\r\nhorses do in this country.\r\n\r\nThe operation of ploughing breaks up the soil, while the rough clods\r\nmay be broken by hand mallets or by the use of the \"hengha\"--a piece\r\nof tree boll harnessed at the ends to a pair of bullocks.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the land prepares it for the cleaning process\r\nwhich is performed by what are termed \"ladders\"; these ladders are\r\nmade of a few bamboos fixed cross-wise and provided with projecting\r\npins to scratch or open the soil, and to collect the roots of the\r\nprevious crop; they are the equivalent of our harrows, and may be\r\nused repeatedly during the winter and spring seasons so that a fine\r\ntilth may be produced.\r\n\r\nWhen manure is essential, it is applied in the later ploughings, but\r\nother large areas have artificial or chemical manures added at\r\nsimilar stages in the process. Farm-yard manure is preferred, but\r\ncastor-cake and the water hyacinth--a weed--constitute good\r\nsubstitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the soil has been satisfactorily prepared, the seed is sown by\r\nhand at the period which appears most suitable for the particular\r\ndistrict. The usual sowing time is from February to the end of May,\r\nand even in June in some districts where late crops can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1 NATIVES PLOUGHING THE GROUND]\r\n\r\nThere are early and late varieties of the plants, and a carefully\r\njudged distribution of the varieties of seed over the districts for\r\nthe growing period will not only yield a succession of crops for\r\neasy harvesting, but will also help the farmer in the selection of\r\nseeds for other areas where atmospheric conditions differ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a good practice, where possible, to sow the seed in two\r\ndirections at right angles to each other, and thus secure as uniform\r\na distribution as possible. The amount of seed used depends partly\r\nupon the district, and in general from 10 lbs. to 30 lbs. per acre\r\nare sown. The seed may cost about 8 annas or more per ser (about 2\r\nlbs.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2 BREAKING UP THE SOIL, OR \"LADDERING\"]\r\n\r\nPlants should be specially cultivated for the production of seed in\r\norder to obtain the best results from these seeds for fibre plants.\r\nMany of the ryots (farmers) use seed which has been collected from\r\nplants grown from inferior seed, or from odd and often poor plants;\r\nthey also grow plants year after year on the same soil. The fibres\r\nobtained, as a rule, and as a result of this method of obtaining\r\nseeds, gradually deteriorate; much better results accrue when\r\nsuccession of crops and change of seed are carefully attended to.\r\n\r\nIf the weather conditions are favourable, the seeds will germinate in\r\n8 to 10 days, after which the plants grow rapidly. The heat and\r\nshowers of rain combined soon form a crust on the soil which should\r\nbe broken; this is done by means of another ladder provided with\r\nlong pins, and Fig. 2 illustrates the operation in process. This\r\nsecond laddering process opens up the soil and allows the moisture\r\nand heat to enter. The young plants are now thinned, and the ground\r\nweeded periodically, until the plants reach a sufficient height or\r\nstrength to prevent the words from spreading.\r\n\r\nThe space between the growing plants will vary according to the\r\nregion; if there is a tendency to slow growth, there is an abundance\r\nof plants; whereas, the thinning is most severe where the plants\r\nshow prospects of growing thick and tall.\r\n\r\nIn a normal season the plants will reach maturity in about 3 1/2 to\r\n4 months from the time of sowing. Although different opinions are\r\nheld as to the best time for harvesting, that when the fruits are\r\nsetting appears to be most in favour; plants harvested at this stage\r\nusually yield a large quantity of good fibre which can be perfectly\r\ncleaned, and which is of good spinning quality.\r\n\r\nThe plants are cut down by hand and with home-made knives; in general,\r\nthese knives are of crude manufacture, but they appear to be quite\r\nsuitable for the purpose. A field of jute plants ready for cutting\r\nwill certainly form a delightful picture, but the prospect of the\r\noperation of cutting indicates a formidable piece of work since it\r\nrequires about 10 to 14 tons of the green crop to produce about 10 to\r\n15 cwt. of clean dry fibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.  RETTING\r\n\r\nThe method of separating the bast layer (in which the fibres are\r\nembedded) from the stem of the plant requires a large supply of water,\r\nsince the plants must be completely submerged in the water for a\r\nperiod varying from 8 to 30 days; such time is dependent upon the\r\nperiod of the year and upon the district in which the operation is\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe above operation of detaching the bast layer from the stem is\r\ntechnically known as \"retting,\" and a good type of retting or\r\nsteeping place is an off-set of a run, branch, or stream where the\r\nwater moves slowly, or even remains at rest, during the time the\r\nplants are under treatment.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of the structural part of the plant is due to a\r\nbacterial action, and gas is given off during the operation. The\r\nfarmer, or ryot, and his men know what progress the action is making\r\nby the presence of the air bells which rise to the surface; when the\r\nformation of air bells ceases, the men examine the plants daily to\r\nsee that the operation does not go too far, otherwise the fibrous\r\nlayer would be injured, and the resulting fibre weak. The stems are\r\ntested in these examinations to see if the fibrous layer, or bast\r\nlayer, will strip off clean from the wood or stem. When the ryot\r\nconsiders that the layers are separated from the core sufficiently\r\neasy, the work of steeping ceases, and the process of stripping is\r\ncommenced immediately. This latter process is conducted in various\r\nways depending upon the practice in vogue in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one area the men work amongst the water breaking up the woody\r\nstructure of the retted plants by means of mallets and cross rails\r\nfixed to uprights in the water; others break the stems by hand;\r\nwhile in other cases the stems are handed out of the water to women\r\nwho strip off the fibrous layer and preserve intact the central core\r\nor straw to be used ultimately for thatching. The strips of fibre\r\nare all cleaned and rubbed in the water to remove all the vegetable\r\nimpurities, and finally the fibre is dried, usually by hanging it\r\nover poles and protecting it from the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the water supply is deficient in the vicinity where the plants\r\nare grown, it may be advantageous to convey the fibrous layers to\r\nsome other place provided with a better supply of water for the\r\nfinal washing and drying; imperfect retting and cleaning are apt to\r\ncreate defects in the fibre, and to cause considerable trouble or\r\ndifficulties in subsequent branches of the industry.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 illustrates photomicrographs of cross sections of a jute plant.\r\nThe lower illustration represents approximately one quarter of a\r\ncomplete cross section. The central part of the stem or pith is\r\nlettered A; the next wide ring B is the woody matter; the outer\r\ncovering or cuticle is marked C; while the actual fibrous layer\r\nappears between the parts B and C, and some of the fibres are\r\nindicated by D. The arrows show the corresponding parts in the three\r\ndistinct views. The middle illustration shows an enlarged view of a\r\nsmall part of the lowest view, while the upper illustration is a\r\nfurther enlarged view of a small section of the middle view. It will\r\nbe seen that each group of fibres is surrounded by vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3 PHOTOMICROGRAPHS OF CROSS SECTIONS OF A JUTE\r\nPLANT]\r\n\r\nAnother method of stripping the fibrous layer off the stems or stalks,\r\nand one which is practised in certain districts with the object of\r\npreserving the straws, consists in breaking off a small portion, say\r\none foot, at the top end of the stem; the operative then grasps the\r\ntops by the hand and shakes the plants to and fro in the water, thus\r\nloosening the parts, after which the straws float out, leaving the\r\nfibrous layer free. The straws are collected for future use, while the\r\nfibre is cleaned and washed in the usual way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.  ASSORTING AND BALING JUTE FIBRE\r\n\r\nThe Indian raw jute trade is conducted under various conditions. The\r\nmethod of marketing may be of such a nature that the farmers in some\r\ndistricts may have to make a rough assortment of the fibre into a\r\nnumber of qualities or grades, and these grades are well known in\r\nthe particular areas; on the other hand, the farmers may prefer to\r\nsell the total yield of fibre at an overhead price per maund. A\r\nmaund is approximately equal to 8 lbs., and this quantity forms a\r\ncomparatively small bundle. In other cases, the fibre is made up into\r\nwhat is known as a \"drum\"; this is a hand-packed bale of from 1 1/2\r\nto 3 or 3 1/2 maunds; it is a very convenient size for transit in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nPractically one half of the total jute crop, of 9 to 10 million\r\nbales of 400 lbs. each, is used in India, and the remaining half is\r\nbaled for export to the various parts of the world; a little over\r\none million bales are exported annually to Great Britain, the bulk\r\nof this fibre comes to Dundee.\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible for foreign purchasers to see the\r\nmaterial at the assorting stations, but the standardized method of\r\nassorting and grading enables a purchaser to form a very good idea\r\nof the quality of the fibre, and its suitability or otherwise for\r\nspecial types of yarn and cloth. Thus, a form of selecting and\r\ngrading has been established on a basis that provides a very large\r\namount of jute each year of a quality which is known as \"a first mark.\"\r\nA mark, in general, in reference to fibre, is simply some symbol,\r\nname, letter, monogram or the like, or a combination of two or\r\nmore, oft-times with reference to some colour, to distinguish the\r\norigin of the fibre, the baler, or the merchant.\r\n\r\nIn normal years there is also a large quantity of fibre of a better\r\nquality than what is known as \"first mark,\" and this better quality\r\nis termed \"fine jute\"; while there is yet a further lot, the quality\r\nof which is below these good ones. Since there are hundreds of\r\ndifferent marks which are of value only to those connected directly\r\nwith the trade, it is unnecessary to dwell on the subject. The\r\nfollowing list, however, shows quotations of various kinds, and is\r\ntaken from the Market Report of the Dundee Advertiser of March, 1920.\r\nThe price of jute, like almost everything else, was at this date\r\nvery high, so in order to make comparisons with the 1920 and normal\r\nprices, we introduce the prices for the corresponding grade, first\r\nmarks, for the same month in the years 1915 onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JUTE PRICES, IN MARCH\r\n          First Marks\r\n\r\n   Year.

This weight includes a permitted\r\nquantity of binding rope, up to 6 lbs. in weight, while the\r\ndimensions in the baling press of the 400 lb. bale are 4'1\" X 1'6\" X 1'\r\n4\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4 NATIVES CARRYING SMALL BALES OF JUTE FIBRE\r\nFROM BOAT TO PRESS HOUSE]\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of the smaller and loosely-packed bales are\r\nconveyed from the various places by boats to the baling houses or\r\npress houses as they are termed. These are very large establishments,\r\nand huge staffs of operatives are necessary to deal rapidly and\r\nefficiently with the large number of bales. In Fig. 4 scores of\r\nnatives, superintended by a European, are seen carrying the smaller\r\nbales on their heads from the river boat to the press house. It is,\r\nof course, unnecessary to make the solid 400 lb. bales for Indian\r\nconsumption; this practice is usually observed only for jute which\r\nis to be exported, and all such bales are weighed and measured at\r\nthe baling station by a Chamber of Commerce expert.\r\n\r\nMost of the baling presses used in the press houses in the Calcutta\r\ndistrict are made in Liverpool, and are provided with the most\r\nefficient type of pumps and mechanical parts. Fig. 5 illustrates one\r\nof these huge presses with a number of natives in close proximity.\r\nTwo or three distinct operations are conducted simultaneously by\r\ndifferent groups of operatives, and ingenious mechanism is essential\r\nfor the successful prosecution of the work. Two such presses as that\r\nillustrated in Fig. 5 are capable, under efficient administration, of\r\nturning out 130 bales of 400 lbs. each in one hour. The fibre is\r\ncompressed into comparatively small bulk by hydraulic pressure equal\r\nto 6,000 lbs. per square inch, and no packed bale must exceed in\r\ncubical capacity 11 cubic feet after it leaves the press; it is\r\nusual for freight purposes to reckon 5 bales or 55 cubic feet per ton.\r\n(Now changed to 50 cubic feet.)\r\n\r\nThe jute bales are loaded either at the wharf or in the river from\r\nbarges into large steamers, many of which carry from 30,000 to\r\n46,000 bales in one cargo to the European ports. One vessel brought\r\n70,000 bales.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, jute is sold under guarantees as to quality,\r\nand all disputes must be settled by arbitration.  Although this is\r\nthe usual method of sale, it is not uncommon for quantities of jute\r\nto be shipped unsold, and such quantities may be disposed of on the\r\n\"Spot.\" It is a common practice to sell a number of bales to sample,\r\nsuch number depending generally upon the extent of the quantity, or\r\n\"parcel,\" as it is often called. The contract forms are very complete,\r\nand enable the business to be conducted to the satisfaction of all\r\nconcerned in the trade.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: FIG. 5 NATIVES BAILING JUTE FIBRE IN A WATSON-FAWCETT\r\nCYCLONE PRESS]\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that, in the yearly production of such a large\r\nquantity of jute fibre from various districts, and obtained from\r\nplants which have been grown under variable climatic and\r\nagricultural conditions, in some cases the fibre will be of the\r\nfinest type procurable, while in other cases it will be of a very\r\nindifferent type and unsuitable for use in the production of the\r\nordinary classes of yarns and fabrics. On the other hand, it should\r\nbe stated that there is such a wide range of goods manufactured, and\r\nadditional varieties occasionally introduced, that it appears\r\npossible to utilize all the kinds of fibre in any year; indeed, it\r\nseems as if the available types of fibre each season create demands\r\nfor a corresponding type of manufactured product.\r\n\r\nThe crops produced will, obviously, vary in amount and value annually,\r\nbut a few figures will help the reader to estimate in some degree\r\nthe extent of the industry and its development in various parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                EXPORTS OF JUTE FROM INDIA\r\n\r\n            Year.

The bales are raised quickly\r\nfrom the hold by means of a hydraulic-engine, scarcely visible in Fig.\r\n6 since it is at the far end of the vessel, but seen clearly in Fig.\r\n7. When the bales are raised sufficiently high, they are guided to\r\nthe comparatively steep part of a chute from which they descend to\r\nthe more horizontal part as exemplified in Fig. 7. They are then\r\nremoved by means of hand-carts as shown, taken into the shed, and\r\npiled or stored in some suitable arrangement with or without the aid\r\nof a crane. Motor and other lorries are then used to convey the bales\r\nto the various mills where the first actual process in what is termed\r\nspinning takes place. It will be understood that the bales are stored\r\nin the spinner's own stores after having been delivered as stated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. HARBOUR PORTERS REMOVING BALES OF JUTE FROM\r\nTHE VESSEL SHOWN IN FIG. 6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.  MILL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n_Bale Opening_. Each spinner, as already indicated, stores his\r\nbales of jute of various \"marks,\" i.e. qualities, in a convenient\r\nmanner, and in a store or warehouse from which any required number\r\nof bales of each mark can be quickly removed to the preparing\r\ndepartment of the mill.\r\n\r\nIn the woollen industry, the term \"blending\" is used to indicate the\r\nmixing of different varieties of material (as well as different\r\nkinds of fibres) for the purpose of obtaining a mixture suitable for\r\nthe preparing and spinning of a definite quality and colour of\r\nmaterial. In much the same way, the term \"batching\" is used in the\r\njute industry, although it will be seen shortly that a more\r\nextensive use is made of the word. A \"batch,\" in its simplest\r\ndefinition, therefore indicates a number of bales which is suitable\r\nfor subsequent handling in the Batching Department. This number may\r\ninclude 5, 6, 7 or more bales of jute according to the amount of\r\naccommodation in the preparing department.\r\n\r\nAll the above bales of a batch may be composed of the same standard\r\nquality of jute, although the marks may be different. It must be\r\nremembered that although the marks have a distinct reference to\r\nquality and colour, they actually represent some particular firm or\r\nfirms of balers or merchants. At other times, the batch of 5 to 10\r\nbales may be composed of different qualities of jute, the number of\r\neach kind depending partly upon the finished price of the yarn,\r\npartly upon the colour, and partly upon the spinning properties of\r\nthe combination.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the purpose for which the finished yarn\r\nis to be used will determine largely the choice of the bales for any\r\nparticular batch. For example, to refer to a simple differentiation,\r\nthe yarn which is to be used for the warp threads in the weaving of\r\ncloth must, in nearly every case, have properties which differ in\r\nsome respects from the yarn which is to be used as weft for the same\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it will be found advantageous, when the same grade of\r\njute is required, to select a batch from different balers' marks so\r\nthat throughout the various seasons an average quality may be\r\nproduced. The same class of yarn is expected at all times of the year,\r\nbut it is well known that the properties of any one mark may vary\r\nfrom time to time owing to the slight variations in the manipulation\r\nof the fibre at the farms, and to the variations of the weather\r\nduring the time of growth, and during the season generally.\r\n\r\nA list of the bales for the batch is sent to the batching department,\r\nthis list being known as a \"batch-ticket.\" The bales are, of course,\r\ndefined by their marks, and those mentioned on the batch-ticket must\r\nbe rigidly adhered to for one particular class of yarn; if there is\r\nany chance of one kind running short, the condition should be\r\nnotified in time so that a suitable mark may be selected to take its\r\nplace without effecting any great change in the character or quality\r\nof the yarn.\r\n\r\nWhen the number and kind of bales have been selected and removed\r\nfrom the groups or parcels in the store or warehouse, they are\r\nconveyed to the batching department, and placed in a suitable\r\nposition near the first machine in the series. It need hardly be\r\nmentioned that since the fibre, during the operation of baling, is\r\nsubjected to such a high hydraulic pressure, the bale presents a\r\nvery solid and hard appearance, see Fig. 7, for the various\r\nso-called \"heads\" of fibre have been squeezed together and forced\r\ninto a very small bulk. In such a state, the heads are quite\r\nunfitted for the actual batching operation; they require to be opened\r\nout somewhat so that the fibres will be more or less separated from\r\neach other. This operation is termed \"opening\" and the process is\r\nconducted in what is known as a \"bale opener,\" one type of which is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 8, and made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,\r\nLtd., Dundee.\r\n\r\nThe various bales of the batch are arranged in a suitable manner\r\nnear the feed side of the machine, on the left in the view, so that\r\nthey can be handled to the best advantage. The bands or ropes, see\r\nFig. 7, are removed from the bale in order that the heads or large\r\npieces of jute can be separated. If any irregularity in the\r\nselection of the heads from the different bales of the batch takes\r\nplace in this first selection of the heads of jute, the faulty\r\nhandling may affect subsequent operations in such a way that no\r\nchance of correcting the defect can occur; it should be noted at\r\nthis stage that if there are slight variations of any kind in the\r\nfibres, it is advisable to make special efforts to obtain a good\r\naverage mixture; as a matter of fact, it is wise to insist upon a\r\njudicious selection in every case. The usual variations are--the\r\ncolour of the fibre, its strength, and the presence of certain\r\nimpurities such as stick, root, bark or specks; if the pieces of jute,\r\nwhich are affected adversely by any of the above, are carefully\r\nmixed with the otherwise perfect fibre, most of the faults may\r\ndisappear as the fibre proceeds on its way through the different\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8 BALE OPENER _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart,\r\nLindsay & Co., Ltd_.]\r\n\r\nThe layers of heads are often beaten with a heavy sledge hammer in\r\nhand batching, but for machine batching a bale opener is used, and\r\nthis operation constitutes the preliminary opening. As already\r\nindicated, the heads of jute are fed into the machine from the left\r\nin Fig. 8, each head being laid on a travelling feed cloth which\r\ncarries the heads of jute successively between a pair of feed\r\nrollers from which they are delivered to two pairs of very\r\ndeeply-fluted crushing rollers or breakers. The last pair of\r\ndeep-fluted rollers is seen clearly on the right in the figure.\r\nThese two pairs of heavy rollers crush and bend the compressed heads\r\nof jute and deliver them in a much softer condition to the delivery\r\nsheet on the right. The delivery sheet is an endless cloth which has\r\na continuous motion, and thus the softened heads are carried to the\r\nextreme right, at which position they are taken from the sheet by\r\nthe operatives. The upper rollers in the machine may rise in their\r\nbearings against the downward pressure of the volute springs on the\r\nbearings; this provision is essential because of the thick and thin\r\nplaces of the heads.\r\n\r\nA different type of bale opener, made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons, &\r\nCo., Dundee, and designed from the Butchart patent is illustrated in\r\nFig. 9. It differs mainly from the machine illustrated in Fig. 8 in\r\nthe shape of the crushing or opening rollers.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen on referring to the illustration that there are\r\nthree crushing rollers, one large central roller on the top and\r\nsituated between two lower but smaller rollers. Each roller has a\r\nseries of knobs projecting from a number of parallel rings. The\r\nknobs are so arranged that they force themselves into the hard\r\nlayers of jute, and, in addition to this action, the heads of jute\r\nhave to bend partially round the larger roller as they are passing\r\nbetween the rollers. This double action naturally aids in opening up\r\nthe material, and the machine, which is both novel and effective,\r\ngives excellent results in practice. The degree of pressure provided\r\nfor the top roller may be varied to suit different conditions of heads\r\nof jute by the number of weights which are shown clearly in the\r\nhighest part of the machine in the form of two sets of heavy discs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9 BALE OPENER _By permission of Messrs. Charles\r\nParker, Sons, & Co_.]\r\n\r\nThe driving side, the feed cloth, and the delivery cloth in this\r\nmachine are placed similarly to the corresponding parts of the\r\nmachine illustrated in Fig. 8, a machine which also gives good\r\nresults in practice.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the large heads are delivered in such a condition that\r\nthe operatives can split them up into pieces of a suitable size\r\nquite freely.\r\n\r\nThe men who bring in the bales from the store take up a position\r\nnear the end of the delivery cloth; they remove the heads of jute as\r\nthe latter approach the end of the table, and then pass them to the\r\nbatchers, who split them. The most suitable size of pieces are 2-1/2\r\nto 3 lbs. for a piece of 7 feet to 8 feet in length, but the size of\r\nthe pieces is regulated somewhat by the system of feeding which is\r\nto be adopted at the breaker-card, as well as by the manager's\r\nopinion of what will give the best overall result.\r\n\r\nAfter the heads of jute have been split up into suitable smaller\r\npieces, they are placed in any convenient position for the batcher\r\nor \"striker-up\" to deal with. If the reader could watch the above\r\noperation of separating the heads of jute into suitable sizes, it\r\nwould perhaps be much easier to understand the process of\r\nunravelling an apparently matted and crossed mass of fibre. As the\r\nloosened head emerges from the bale-opener, Figs. 8 or 9, it is\r\nplaced over the operative's arm with the ends of the head hanging,\r\nand by a sort of intuition acquired by great experience, she or he\r\ngrips the correct amount of fibre between the fingers, and by a\r\ndexterous movement, and a simultaneous shake of the whole piece, the\r\nhandful just comes clear of the bulk and in much less time than it\r\ntakes to describe the operation.\r\n\r\nAs the pieces are thus detached from the bulk, they are laid on\r\nstools or tables, or in stalls or carts, according to the method by\r\nmeans of which the necessary amount of oil and water is to be added\r\nfor the essential process of lubrication; this lubrication enables\r\nthe fibre to work freely in the various machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.  BATCHING\r\n\r\n_Softening and Softening Machines_. Two distinct courses are\r\nfollowed in the preparation of the jute fibre after it leaves the\r\nbale opener, and before it is carded by the breaker card. These\r\ncourses are designated as--\r\n\r\n      1. Hand Batching.\r\n      2. Machine Batching.\r\n\r\nIn the former process, which is not largely practised, the pieces of\r\njute are neatly doubled, while imparting a slight twist, to\r\nfacilitate subsequent handling, and laid in layers in large carts\r\nwhich can be wheeled from place to place; if this method is not\r\nconvenient, the pieces are doubled similarly and deposited in large\r\nstalls such as those illustrated in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of each layer, or sometimes two layers, the\r\nnecessary measured amount of oil is evenly sprayed by hand over the\r\npieces from cans provided with suitable perforated outlets--usually\r\nlong tubes. After the oil has been added, water, from a similar\r\nsprayer attached by tubing to a water tap, is added until the\r\nattendant has applied what he or she considers is the proper quantity.\r\nThe ratio between a measured amount of oil and an unmeasured amount\r\nof water is thus somewhat varied, and for this reason the above\r\nmethod is not to be commended. A conscientious worker can, however,\r\nwith judgment, introduce satisfactory proportions which are, of\r\ncourse, supplied by the person in charge. In Fig. 10, the tank on\r\nthe right is where the oil is stored, while the oil can, and the\r\nspray-pipe and tube for water, are shown near the second post or\r\npartition on the right.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: FIG. 10 HAND-BATCHING DEPARTMENT WITH UNPREPARED AND\r\nPREPARED FIBRE]\r\n\r\nThe first stall--that next to the oil tank--in Fig. 10 is filled\r\nwith the prepared pieces, and the contents are allowed to remain\r\nthere for some time, say 24 hours, in order that the material may be\r\nmore or less uniformly lubricated or conditioned. At the end of this\r\ntime, the pieces are ready to be conveyed to and fed into the\r\nsoftening machines where the fibres undergo a further process of\r\nbending and crushing.\r\n\r\nAll softening machines for jute, or softeners as they are often\r\ncalled, are similar in construction, but the number of pairs of\r\nrollers varies according to circumstances and to the opinions of\r\nmanagers. Thus, the softener illustrated in Fig. 11, which, in the\r\nform shown, is intended to treat jute from the above-mentioned stalls,\r\nis made with 47, 55, 63 or 71 pairs of rollers or any other number\r\nwhich, minus 1, is a measure of 8. The sections are made in 8's. The\r\nillustration shows only 31 pairs.\r\n\r\nThe first pair of rollers--that next to the feed sheet in the\r\nforeground of Fig. 11--is provided with straight flutes as clearly\r\nshown. All the other rollers, however, are provided with oblique\r\nflutes, such flutes making a small angle with the horizontal. What\r\nis often considered as a standard softening machine contains 63\r\npairs of fluted rollers besides the usual feed and delivery rollers.\r\nAs mentioned above, this number is varied according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe lubricated pieces of jute are fed on to the feed roller sheet,\r\nand hence undergo a considerable amount of bending in different ways\r\nbefore they emerge from the delivery rollers at the other end of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11 Softening machine without batching apparatus]\r\n\r\nMachine batching is preferred by many firms because the application\r\nof oil and water, and the proportion of each, are much more uniform\r\nthan they are by the above mentioned process of hand batching. On the\r\nother hand, there is no time for conditioning the fibre because the\r\nlubrication and the softening are proceeding simultaneously,\r\nalthough conditioning may proceed while the fibre remains in the\r\ncart after it has left the softener.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical apparatus as made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,\r\nLtd., Dundee, for depositing the oil and water on the pieces or\r\n\"stricks\" of jute is illustrated in Fig. 12. The actual lubricating\r\nequipment is situated on the top of the rectangular frame in the\r\ncentre of the illustration. This frame is bolted to the side frames\r\nof the softening machine proper, say that shown in Fig. 11. Its\r\nexact position, with respect to its distance from the feed, is a\r\nmatter of choice, but the liquid is often arranged to fall on to the\r\nmaterial at any point between the second and twelfth rollers.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 the ends of 13 rollers of the upper set are seen clearly,\r\nand these upper rollers are kept hard in contact with the stricks or\r\npieces of jute by means of the powerful springs shown immediately\r\nabove the roller bearings and partially enclosed in bell-jars.\r\n\r\nOutside the rectangular frame in Fig. 12 are two rods, one vertical\r\nand the other inclined. The straight or vertical rod is attached by\r\nsuitable levers and rods to the set-on handles at each end of the\r\nmachine and to the valve of the water pipe near the top of the frame,\r\nwhile the upper end of the inclined or oblique rod is fulcrumed on a\r\nrod projecting from the frame. The lower or curved end of the\r\noblique rod rests against the boss of one of the upper rollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\nThe water valve is opened and closed with the starting and stopping\r\nof the machine, but the oblique rod is moved only when irregular\r\nfeeding takes place. Thus, the upper rollers rise slightly against\r\nthe pressure of the springs when thick stricks appear; hence, when a\r\nthick place passes under the roller which is in contact with the\r\ncurved end of the oblique rod, the end moves slightly clockwise, and\r\nthus rotates the fulcrum rod; this results in an increased quantity\r\nof oil being liberated from the source of supply, and the mechanism\r\nis so arranged that the oil reaches the thick part of the strick.\r\nWhen the above-mentioned upper roller descends, due to a decrease in\r\nthe thickness of the strick, the oblique rod and its fulcrum is\r\nmoved slightly counter-clockwise, and less oil is liberated for the\r\nthin part of the strick. It will be understood that all makers of\r\nsoftening machines supply the automatic lubricating or batching\r\napparatus when desired.\r\n\r\nA view of a softener at work appears in Fig. 13. The bevel wheels at\r\nthe end of the rollers are naturally covered as a protection against\r\naccidents. In many machines safety appliances are fitted at the feed\r\nend so that the machine may be automatically stopped if the\r\noperative is in danger. The batching apparatus for this machine is\r\nof a different kind from that illustrated in Fig. 12; moreover, it\r\nis placed nearer the feed rollers than the twelfth pair. The feed\r\npipes for the oil and the water are shown coming from a high plane,\r\nand the supply is under the influence of chain gearing as shown on\r\nthe right near the large driving belt from the drum on the shafting.\r\n\r\nThe feed roller in this machine is a spirally fluted one, and the\r\nnature of the flutes is clearly emphasized in the view. The barrow\r\nof jute at the far end of the machine is built up from stricks which\r\nhave passed through the machine, and these stricks are now ready for\r\nconditioning, and will be stored in a convenient position for future\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13 Softening machine with batching apparatus]\r\n\r\nWhile the jute as assorted and baled for export from India is graded\r\nin such a way that it may be used for certain classes of yarn\r\nwithout any further selection or treatment, it may be possible to\r\nutilize the material to better advantage by a judicious selection\r\nand treatment after it has undergone the operation of batching.\r\n\r\nWhat are known as cuttings are often treated by a special machine\r\nknown as a \"root-opener.\" The jute cuttings are fed into the\r\nmachines and the fibre rubbed between fixed and rotating pins in\r\norder to loosen the matted ends of stricks. Foreign matter drops\r\nthrough the openings of a grid to the floor, and the fibre is\r\ndelivered on to a table, or, if desired, on to the feed sheet of the\r\nsoftener.\r\n\r\nThe root ends of stricks are sometimes treated by a special machine\r\ntermed a root-comber with the object of loosening the comparatively\r\nhard end of the strick. A snipping machine or a teazer may also be\r\nused for somewhat similar purposes, and for opening out ropes and\r\nsimilar close textures.\r\n\r\nThe cuttings may be partially loosened by means of blows from a\r\nheavy iron bar; boiling water is then poured on the fibre, and then\r\nthe material is built up with room left for expansion, and allowed\r\nto remain in this condition for a few days. A certain quantity of\r\nthis material may then be used along with other marks of jute to\r\nform a batch suitable for the intended yarn.\r\n\r\nA very common practice is to cut the hard root ends off by means of\r\na large stationary knife. At other times, the thin ends of the\r\nstricks are also cut off by the same instrument. These two parts are\r\nsevered when it is desired to utilize only the best part of the\r\nstrick. The root ends are usually darker in colour than the remainder,\r\nand hence the above process is one of selection with the object of\r\nsecuring a yarn which will be uniform in colour and in strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.  CARDING\r\n\r\n_Breaker and Finisher Cards_. After the fibre from the softening\r\nmachine has been conditioned for the desired time, it is ready for\r\none of the most important processes in the cycle of jute manufacture;\r\nthis process is termed carding, and is conducted in two distinct\r\ntypes of machines--\r\n\r\n\r\n        1. The breaker card.\r\n        2. The finisher card.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe functions of the two machines are almost identical; indeed, one\r\nmight say that the work of carding should be looked upon as one\r\ncontinuous operation.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between the two types of machines is in the\r\nmethod of feeding, and the degree of fineness or setting of the\r\nsmall tools or pins which perform the work. In both cases the action\r\non the stricks of jute is equivalent to a combined combing and\r\nsplitting movement, and the pins in the various rollers move\r\nrelatively to each other so that while the pins of a slowly-moving\r\nroller allow the strick or stricks (because there are several side\r\nby side) to pass slowly and gradually from end to end, the pins of\r\nanother but quickly-moving roller perform the splitting and the\r\ncombing of the fibre. The pins of the slowly-moving roller hold, so\r\nto speak, the strick, while the pins of the quickly-moving roller\r\ncomb out the fibres and split adhering parts asunder so as to make a\r\ncomparatively fine division.\r\n\r\nThe conditioned stricks from the softening machine are first\r\narranged in some suitable receptacle and within easy reach of the\r\noperative at the back or feed side of the breaker card. A receptacle,\r\nvery similar to that used at the breaker card, appears near the far\r\nend of the softening machine in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nA modern breaker card is illustrated in Fig. 14. The feed or back of\r\nthe card is on the extreme right, the delivery or front of the card\r\non the extreme left, while the gear side of the card is facing the\r\nobserver. The protecting cages were removed so that the wheels would\r\nbe seen as clearly as possible.\r\n\r\nSome of the stricks of fibre are seen distinctly on the feed side of\r\nthe figure; they are accommodated, as mentioned, in a channel-shaped\r\nstand on the far side of the inclined feed sheet, or feed cloth,\r\nwhich leads up to and conveys the stricks into the grip of the\r\nfeeding apparatus. This particular type is termed a \"shell\" feed\r\nbecause the upper contour of the guiding feed bracket is shaped\r\nsomewhat like a shell. There is a gradually decreasing and\r\nsuitably-sized gap between the upper part of the shell and the pins\r\nof the feed roller.\r\n\r\nThe root ends of the pins in this roller lead, and the stricks of\r\nfibre are gripped between the pins and the shell, and simultaneously\r\ncarried into the machine where they come into contact with the\r\npoints of the pins in the rapidly-revolving large roller, termed a\r\ncylinder. The above-mentioned combing and splitting action takes\r\nplace at this point as well as for a distance of, say, 24 inches to\r\n30 inches below. The fibres which are separated at this stage are\r\ncarried a little further round until they come into contact with the\r\npoints of the pins in the above-mentioned slowly-moving roller,\r\ntermed a \"worker,\" and while the fibres are moving slowly forward\r\nunder the restraining influence of the worker, they are further\r\ncombed and split. A portion of the fibres is carried round by the\r\npins of the worker from which such fibres are removed by the\r\nquicker moving pins of the second roller of the pair, termed a\r\n\"stripper,\" and in turn these fibres are removed from the pins of\r\nthe stripper by the much quicker moving pins of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14 MODERN BREAKER CARD]\r\n\r\nThe above operations conducted by the first pair of rollers (worker\r\nand stripper) in conjunction with the cylinder, are repeated by a\r\nsecond and similar pair of rollers (worker and stripper), and ultimately\r\nthe thin sheet of combed and split fibres comes into contact with the\r\npins of the doffer from which it is removed by the drawing and pressing\r\nrollers. The sheet of fibres finally emerges from these rollers into\r\nthe broad and upper part of the conductor. This conductor, made mostly\r\nof tin and V-shaped, is shown clearly on the left of the machine in\r\nFig. 14. Immediately the thin film or sheet of fibres enters the\r\nconductor, it is caused as a body gradually to contract in width and,\r\nof course, to increase in thickness, and is simultaneously guided and\r\ndelivered to the delivery rollers, and from these to the sliver can,\r\ndistinctly seen immediately below the delivery rollers. The sliver is\r\nseen emerging from the above rollers and entering the sliver can.\r\n\r\nThe fibres in this machine are thus combed, split and drawn forward\r\nrelatively to each other, in addition to being arranged more or less\r\nparallel to each other. The technical term \"draft\" is used to\r\nindicate the operation of causing the fibres to slip on each other,\r\nand in future we shall speak about this attenuation or drawing out\r\nof the fibres by this special term \"draft.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that, since the sliver is delivered into the can\r\nat the rate of about 50 yards per minute, this constant flow will\r\nsoon provide a sufficient length of sliver to fill a sliver can,\r\nalthough the latter may hold approximately 20 lbs. The machine must,\r\nof course, deliver its quota to enable succeeding machines to be\r\nkept in practically constant work. As a matter of fact, the machines\r\nare arranged in what are termed \"systems,\" so that this desirable\r\ncondition of a constant and sufficient feed to all may be\r\nsatisfactorily fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe driving or pulley side of the breaker card is very similar to\r\nthat shown in Fig. 15 which, however, actually represents the pulley\r\nside of one type of finisher card as made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser &\r\nSons, Ltd., Arbroath. All finisher cards are fed by slivers which\r\nhave been made as explained in connection with the breaker card, but\r\nthere are two distinct methods of feeding the slivers, or rather of\r\narranging the slivers at the feed side. In both cases, however, the\r\nfull width of the card is fed by slivers laid side by side, with,\r\nhowever, a thin guide plate between each pair, and one at each\r\nextreme end.\r\n\r\nOne very common method of feeding is to place 10 or 12 full sliver\r\ncans--which have been prepared at the breaker card--on the floor and\r\nto the right of the machine illustrated in Fig. 15. The sliver from\r\neach can is then placed into the corresponding sliver guide, and\r\nthus the full width of the machine is occupied. The slivers are\r\nguided by the sliver guides on to an endless cloth or \"feed sheet\"\r\nwhich, in turn, conveys them continuously between the feed rollers.\r\nThe feed apparatus in such machines is invariably of the roller type,\r\nand sometimes it involves what is known as a \"porcupine\" roller. It\r\nwill be understood that the feeding of level slivers is a different\r\nproblem from that which necessitates the feeding of comparatively\r\nuneven stricks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: By permission of Messrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd.\r\nFIG. 15 FINISHER CARD WITH DRAWING-HEAD]\r\n\r\nThe slivers travel horizontally with the feed-sheet and enter the\r\nmachine at a height of about 4 feet from the floor. They thus form,\r\nas it were, a sheet of fibrous material at the entrance, and this\r\nsheet of fibres comes in contact with the pins of the various pairs\r\nof rollers, the cylinder, and the doffer, in much the same way as\r\nalready described in connection with the breaker card. There are,\r\nhowever, more pairs of rollers in the finisher card than there are\r\nin the breaker card, for while the latter is provided with two pairs\r\nof rollers, the former may be arranged with 3, 4, 5 or even 6 pairs\r\nof rollers (6 workers and 6 strippers). The number of pairs of\r\nrollers depends upon the degree of work required, and upon the\r\nopinions of the various managers.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct types of finisher cards, viz--\r\n\r\n         1. Half-circular finisher cards.\r\n\r\n         2. Full-circular finisher cards.\r\n\r\nThe machine illustrated in Fig. 15 is of the latter type, and such\r\nmachines are so-called because the various pairs of rollers are so\r\ndisposed around the cylinder that they occupy almost a complete\r\ncircle, and the fibre under treatment must move from pair to pair to\r\nundergo the combing and splitting action before coming into contact\r\nwith the doffer. There are five pairs of rollers in the machine in\r\nFig. 15, and all the rollers are securely boxed in, and the wheels\r\nfenced. The arrangement of the wheels on the gear side is very\r\nsimilar to that shown in connection with the breaker card in Fig. 14,\r\nand therefore requires no further mention. Outside the boxing comes\r\nthe covers, shown clearly at the back of the machine in Fig. 15, and\r\nadapted to be easily and quickly opened when it is desired to\r\nexamine the rollers and other parts.\r\n\r\nThe slivers, after having passed amongst the pins of the various\r\nrollers, and been subjected to the required degree of draft, are\r\nultimately doffed as a thin film of fibres from the pins of the\r\ncylinder and pass between the drawing rollers to the conductor. The\r\nconductor of a finisher card is made in two widths, so that half the\r\nwidth of the film enters one section and the other half enters the\r\nother section. These two parallel sheets, split from one common sheet,\r\ntraverse the two conductors and are ultimately delivered as two\r\nslivers about 6 inches above the point or plane in which the 10 or 12\r\nslivers entered, and on to what is termed a \"sliver plate.\" The two\r\nslivers are then guided by horns projecting from the upper surface\r\nof the sliver plate, made to travel at right angles to the direction\r\nof delivery from the mouths of the conductors, and then united to\r\npass as a single sliver between a pair of delivery rollers on the\r\nleft of the feed and delivery side and finally into a sliver can.\r\n\r\nIn special types of finishing cards, an extra piece of\r\nmechanism--termed a draw-head--is employed. The machine illustrated\r\nin Fig. 15 is provided with this extra mechanism which is supported\r\nby the small supplementary frame on the extreme right. This special\r\nmechanism is termed a \"Patent Push Bar Drawing Head,\" and the\r\nfunction which it performs will be described shortly; in the\r\nmeantime it is sufficient to say that it is used only when the\r\nslivers from the finisher card require extra or special treatment. A\r\nvery desirable condition in connection with the combination of a\r\nfinisher card and a draw-head is that the two distinct parts should\r\nwork in unison. In the machine under consideration, the feed and\r\ndelivery rollers of the card stop simultaneously with the stoppage\r\nof the draw-head mechanism.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief aims in spinning is that of producing a uniform\r\nthread; uniform not only in section, but in all other respects. A\r\nso-called level thread refers, in general, to a uniform diameter,\r\nbut there are other equally, if not more, important phases connected\r\nwith the full sense of the word uniform.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that in the batching department various\r\nqualities of jute are mixed as judiciously as possible in order to\r\nobtain a satisfactory mixture. Fibres of different grades and marks\r\nvary in strength, colour, cleanness, diameter, length and suppleness;\r\nit is of the utmost importance that these fibres of diverse\r\nqualities should be distributed as early as possible in the process\r\nso as to facilitate the subsequent operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. James F. Low & Co., Ltd. _\r\nFIG. 16 WASTE TEAZER]\r\n\r\nHowever skilfully the work of mixing the stricks is performed in the\r\nbatching department, the degree of uniformity leaves something to be\r\ndesired; further improvement is still desirable and indeed necessary.\r\nIt need hardly be said, however, that the extent of the improvement,\r\nand the general final result, are influenced greatly by the care\r\nwhich is exercised in the preliminary processes.\r\n\r\nThe very fact of uniting 10 or 12 slivers at the feed of the\r\nfinisher card mixes 10 or 12 distinct lengths into another new length,\r\nand, in addition, separates in some measure the fibres of each\r\nindividual sliver. It must not be taken for granted that the new\r\nlength of sliver is identical with each of the individual lengths\r\nand ten or twelve times as bulky. A process of drafting takes place\r\nin the finisher card, so that the fibres which compose the combined\r\n10 or 12 slivers shall be drawn out to a draft of 8 to 16 or even\r\nmore; this means that for every yard of the group of slivers which\r\npasses into the machine there is drawn out a length of 8 to 16 yards\r\nor whatever the draft happens to be. The resulting sliver will\r\ntherefore be approximately two-thirds the bulk of each of the\r\noriginal individual slivers. The actual ratio between them will\r\nobviously depend upon the actual draft which is imparted to the\r\nmaterial by the relative velocities of the feed and delivery rollers.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural to expect that a certain amount of the fibrous\r\nmaterial will escape from the rollers; this forms what is known as\r\ncard waste. And in all subsequent machines there is produced, in\r\nspite of all care, a percentage of the amount fed into the machine\r\nwhich is not delivered as perfect material. All this waste from\r\nvarious sources, e.g. thread waste, rove waste, card waste, ropes,\r\ndust-shaker waste, etc., is ultimately utilized to produce sliver\r\nfor heavy sacking weft.\r\n\r\nThe dust-shaker, as its name implies, separates the dust from the\r\nvaluable fibrous material, and finally all the waste products are\r\npassed through a waste teazer such as that made by Messrs. J. F. Low &\r\nCo., Ltd., Monifieth, and illustrated in Fig. 16. The resulting mass\r\nis then re-carded, perhaps along with other more valuable material,\r\nand made into a sliver which is used, as stated above, in the\r\nproduction of a cheap and comparatively thick weft such as that used\r\nfor sacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.  DRAWING AND DRAWING FRAMES\r\n\r\nThe operations of combing and splitting as performed in both the\r\nbreaker and finisher card are obviously due to the circular movement\r\nof the pins since all these (with the single exception of those in\r\nthe draw-head mechanism of certain finisher cards) are carried on the\r\nperipheries of rotating rollers. In the draw-head mechanism, the\r\npins move, while in contact with the fibres, in a rectilinear or\r\nstraight path. In the machines which fall to be discussed in this\r\nchapter, viz., the \"drawing frames,\" the action of the pins on the\r\nslivers from the finisher card is also in a straight path; as a\r\nmatter of fact, the draw-head of a finisher card is really a small\r\ndrawing frame, as its name implies. Moreover, each row or rather\r\ndouble row, of pins is carried separately by what is termed a\r\n\"faller.\" The faller as a whole consists of three parts:\r\n\r\n        1. A long iron or steel rod with provision for being\r\n        moved in a closed circuit.\r\n\r\n        2. Pour or six brass plates, termed \"gills\" or\r\n        \"stocks,\" fixed to the rod.\r\n\r\n        3. A series of short pins (one row sometimes about\r\n        1/8 in. shorter than the second row), termed gill or\r\n        hackle pins, and set perpendicularly in the above\r\n        gills.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of fallers used is determined partly by the particular\r\nmethod of operating the fallers, but mostly by the length of the\r\nfibre. The gill pins in the fallers are used to restrain the\r\nmovements of the fibres between two important pairs of rollers.\r\nThere are actually about four sets of rollers from front to back of\r\na drawing frame; one set of three rollers constitute the \"retaining\"\r\nrollers; then comes the drawing roller and its large pressing roller;\r\nimmediately after this pair is the \"slicking\" rollers, and the last\r\npair is the delivery rollers. The delivery rollers of one type of\r\ndrawing frame, called the \"push-bar\" drawing frame, and made by\r\nMesssrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd., Arbroath, are seen distinctly\r\nin Fig. 17, and the can or cans into which the slivers are\r\nultimately delivered are placed immediately below one or more\r\nsections of these rollers and in the foreground of the illustration.\r\nThe large pressing rollers, which are in contact with the drawing\r\nroller, occupy the highest position in the machine and near the\r\ncentre of same. Between these rollers and the retaining rollers are\r\nsituated the above-mentioned fallers with their complements of gill\r\npins, forming, so to speak, a field of pins.\r\n\r\nEach sliver, and there maybe from four to eight or more in a set, is\r\nled from its sliver can at the far side of the machine to the sliver\r\nguide and between the retaining rollers. Immediately the slivers\r\nleave the retaining rollers they are penetrated by the gill pins of\r\na faller which is rising from the lower part of its circuit to the\r\nupper and active position. Each short length of slivers is\r\npenetrated by the pins of a rising faller, these coming up\r\nsuccessively as the preceding one moves along at approximately the\r\nsame surface speed as that of the retaining rollers. The sheet of\r\npins and their fallers are thus continuously moving towards the\r\ndrawing rollers and supporting the slivers at the same time. As each\r\nfaller in succession approaches close to the drawing rollers, it is\r\nmade to descend so that the pins may leave the fibres, and from this\r\npoint the faller moves backwards towards the retaining roller until\r\nit reaches the other end ready to rise again in contact with the\r\nfibres and to repeat the cycle as just described. It will thus be\r\nseen that the upper set of fallers occupy the full stretch between\r\nthe retaining rollers and the drawing rollers, but there is always\r\none faller leaving the upper set at the front and another joining\r\nthe set at the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17 Push-bar drawing frame]\r\n\r\nThe actual distance between the retaining rollers and the drawing\r\nrollers is determined by the length of the fibre, and must in all\r\ncases be a little greater than the longest fibre. This condition is\r\nnecessary because the surface speed of the drawing roller is much\r\ngreater than that of the retaining rollers; indeed, the difference\r\nbetween the surface speeds of the two pairs of rollers is the actual\r\ndraft.\r\n\r\nBetween the retaining and drawing rollers the slivers are embedded\r\nin the gill pins of the fallers, and these move forward, as mentioned,\r\nto support the stretch of slivers and to carry the latter to the nip\r\nof the drawing rollers. Immediately the forward ends of the fibres\r\nare nipped between the quickly-moving drawing rollers, the fibres\r\naffected slide on those which have not yet reached the drawing\r\nrollers, and, incidentally, help to parallelize the fibres. It will\r\nbe clear that if any fibre happened to be in the grip of the two\r\npairs of rollers having different surface speeds, such fibre would be\r\nsnapped. It is to avoid this rupture of fibres that the distance\r\nbetween the two sets of rollers is greater than the longest fibres\r\nunder treatment. The technical word for this distance is \"reach.\"\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the drawing rollers, the combed slivers pass\r\nbetween slicking rollers, and then approach the sliver plate which\r\nbridges the gap between the slicking rollers and the delivery rollers,\r\nand by means of which plate two or more individual slivers are\r\ndiverted at right angles, first to join each other, and then again\r\ndiverted at right angles to join another sliver which passes\r\nstraight from the drawing rollers and over the sliver plate to the\r\nguide of the delivery rollers. It will thus be seen that a number of\r\nslivers, each having been drawn out according to the degree of draft,\r\nare ultimately joined to pass through a common sliver guide or\r\nconductor to the nip of the delivery rollers, and thence into a\r\nsliver can.\r\n\r\nThe push-bar drawing illustrated in Fig. 17, or some other of the\r\nsame type, is often used as the first drawing frame in a set. With\r\nthe exception of the driving pulleys, all the gear wheels are at the\r\nfar end of the frame, and totally enclosed in dust-proof casing. The\r\nset-on handles, for moving the belt from the loose pulley to the\r\nfast pulley, or _vice versa_, are conveniently situated, as shown,\r\nand in a place which is calculated to offer the least obstruction to\r\nthe operative. The machines are made with what are known as\r\n\"two heads\" or \"three heads.\" It will be seen from the large\r\npressing rollers that there are two pairs; hence the machine is a\r\n\"two-head\" drawing frame.\r\n\r\nThe slivers from the first drawing frame are now subjected to a\r\nfurther process of doubling and drafting in a very similar machine\r\ntermed the second drawing frame. The pins in the gills for this\r\nframe are rather finer and more closely set than those in the first\r\ndrawing frame, but otherwise the active parts of the machines, and\r\nthe operations conducted therein, are practically identical, and\r\ntherefore need no further description. It should be mentioned,\r\nhowever, that there are different types of drawing frames, and their\r\ndesignation is invariably due to the particular manner in which the\r\nfallers are operated while traversing the closed circuit. The names\r\nof other drawing frames appear below.\r\n\r\n  Spiral or screw gill;\r\n  Open link chain;\r\n  Rotary;\r\n  Ring Carrier\r\n  Circular.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of slivers for some classes of yarn it is\r\nconsidered desirable to extend the drawing and doubling operation in\r\na third drawing frame; as a rule, however, two frames are considered\r\nsufficient for most classes of ordinary yarn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.  THE ROVING FRAME\r\n\r\nThe process of doubling ends with the last drawing frame, but there\r\nstill remains a process by means of which the drafting of the\r\nslivers and the parallelization of the fibres are continued. And, in\r\naddition to these important functions, two other equally important\r\noperations are conducted simultaneously, viz., that of imparting to\r\nthe drawn out sliver a slight twist to form what is known as a\r\n\"rove\" or roving, and that of winding the rove on to a large rove\r\nbobbin ready for the actual spinning frame.\r\n\r\nThe machine in which this multiple process is performed is termed a\r\n\"roving frame.\" Such machines are made in various sizes, and with\r\ndifferent types of faller mechanism, but each machine is provided\r\nfor the manipulation of two rows of bobbins, and, of course, with\r\ntwo rows of spindles and flyers. These two rows of spindles, flyers,\r\nand rove bobbin supports are shown clearly in Fig. 18, which\r\nrepresents a spiral roving frame made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser &\r\nSons, Ltd., Arbroath.\r\n\r\nEach circular bobbin support is provided with pins rising from the\r\nupper face of the disc, and these pins serve to enter holes in the\r\nflange of the bobbin and thus to drive the bobbin. The discs or\r\nbobbin supports are situated in holes in the \"lifter rail\" or\r\n\"builder rail\" or simply the \"builder\"; the vertical spindles pass\r\nthrough the centre of the discs, each spindle being provided with a\r\n\"flyer,\" and finally a number of plates rest upon the tops of the\r\nspindles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18 ROVING FRAME _By Permission of Messrs.\r\nDouglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd_.]\r\n\r\nA roving machine at work is shown in Fig. 19, and it will be seen\r\nthat the twisted sliver or rove on emerging from the drawing rollers\r\npasses obliquely to the top of the spindle, through a guide eye,\r\nthen between the channel-shaped bend at the upper part of the flyer,\r\nround the flyer arm, through an eye at the extreme end of either of\r\nthe flyer arms, and finally on to the bobbin. Each bobbin has its\r\nown sliver can (occasionally two), and the sliver passes from this\r\ncan between the sides of the sliver guide, between the retaining\r\nrollers, then amongst the gill pins of the fallers and between the\r\ndrawing (also the delivery) rollers. Here the sliver terminates\r\nbecause the rotary action of the flyer imparts a little twist and\r\ncauses the material to assume a somewhat circular sectional form.\r\nFrom this point, the path followed to the bobbin is that described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAs in all the preceding machines, the delivery speed of the sliver\r\nis constant and is represented by the surface speed of the periphery\r\nof the delivery rollers, this speed approximates to about 20 yards\r\nper minute. The spindles and their flyers are also driven at a\r\nconstant speed, because in all cases we have--\r\n\r\n  spindle speed = delivery x twist.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a constant length of yarn to be wound on the rove\r\nbobbin per minute, and the speed of the bobbin, which is driven\r\nindependently of the spindle and flyer, is constant for any one\r\nseries of rove coils on the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin differs,\r\nhowever, for each complete layer of rove, simply because the\r\neffective diameter of the material on the bobbin changes with the\r\nbeginning of each new layer.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the flyers always rotate in the same horizontal plane,\r\nand hence the rove always passes to the bobbins at the same height\r\nfrom any fixed point. The bobbins, however, are raised gradually by\r\nthe builder during the formation of each layer from the top of the\r\nbobbin to the bottom, and lowered gradually by the builder during\r\nthe formation of each layer from bottom to top. In other words, the\r\ntravel of the builder is represented by the distance between the\r\ninner faces of the flanges of the rove bobbin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19 ROVING FRAME FAIRBAIRN'S ROVING FRAME IN WORK]\r\n\r\nSince every complete layer of rove is wound on the bobbin in virtue\r\nof the joint action of the spindle and flyer, the rotating bobbin,\r\nand the builder, each complete traverse of the latter increases the\r\ncombined diameter of the rove and bobbin shaft by two diameters of\r\nthe rove. It is therefore necessary to impart an intermittent and\r\nvariable speed to the bobbin. The mechanism by means of which this\r\ndesirable and necessary speed is given to the bobbin constitutes one\r\nof the most elegant groups of mechanical parts which obtains in\r\ntextile machinery. Some idea of the intricacy of the mechanism, as\r\nwell as its value and importance to the industry, may be gathered\r\nfrom the fact that a considerable number of textile and mechanical\r\nexperts struggled with the problem for years; indeed 50 years\r\nelapsed before an efficient and suitable group of mechanical parts\r\nwas evolved for performing the function.\r\n\r\nThe above group of mechanical parts is known as \"the differential\r\nmotion,\" and the difficulties in constructing its suitable gearing\r\narose from the fact that the speed of the rove passing on to the\r\nvarious diameters must be maintained throughout, and must coincide\r\nwith the delivery of yarn from the rollers, so that the attenuated\r\nbut slightly twisted sliver can be wound on to the bobbin without\r\nstrain or stretch. The varying motion is regulated and obtained by a\r\ndrive, either from friction plates or from cones, and the whole gear\r\nis interesting, instructive--and sometimes bewildering--two distinct\r\nmotions, a constant one and a variable one, are conveyed to the\r\nbobbins from the driving shaft of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe machine illustrated in Fig. 18 is of special design, and the\r\nwhole train of gear, with the exception of a small train of wheels\r\nto the retaining roller, is placed at the pulley end--that nearest\r\nthe observer. The gear wheels are, as shown, efficiently guarded,\r\nand provision is made to start or stop the machine from any position\r\non both sides. The machine is adapted for building 10 in. X 5 in.\r\nbobbins, i.e. 10 in. between the flanges and 5 in. outside diameter,\r\nand provided with either 56 or 64 spindles, the illustration showing\r\npart of a machine and approximately 48 spindles.\r\n\r\nThe machines for rove (roving frames) are designated by the size of\r\nthe bobbin upon which the rove is wound, e.g. 10 in. x 5 in. frame,\r\nand so on; this means that the flanges of the bobbin are 10 in.\r\napart and 5 in. in diameter, and hence the traverse of the builder\r\nwould be 10 in. The 10 in. x 5 in. bobbin is the standard size for\r\nthe ordinary run of yarns, but 9 in. x 4-1/2 in. bobbins are\r\nused for the roves from which finer yarns are spun. When the\r\nfinished yarn appears in the form of rove (often termed spinning\r\ndirect), as is the case for heavier sizes or thick yarns, 8 in. x 4\r\nin. bobbins are largely used.\r\n\r\nProvision is made on each roving frame for changing the size of rove\r\nso as to accommodate it for the subsequent process of spinning and\r\naccording to the count of the required yarn; the parts involved in\r\nthese changes are those which affect the draft gearing, the twist\r\ngearing, and the builder gearing in conjunction with the automatic\r\nindex wheel which acts on the whole of the regulating motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.  SPINNING\r\n\r\nThe final machine used in the conversion of rove to the size of yarn\r\nrequired is termed the spinning frame. The actual process of\r\nspinning is performed in this machine, and, although the whole\r\nroutine of the conversion of fibre into yarn often goes under the\r\nname of spinning, it is obvious that a considerable number of\r\nprocesses are involved, and an immense amount of work has to be done\r\nbefore the actual process of spinning is attempted. The nomenclature\r\nis due to custom dating back to prehistoric times when the\r\nconversion of fibre to yarn was conducted by much simpler apparatus\r\nthan it is at present; the established name to denote this\r\nconversion of fibre to yarn now refers only to one of a large number\r\nof important processes, each one of which is as important and\r\nnecessary as the actual operation of spinning.\r\n\r\nA photographical reproduction of a large spinning flat in one of the\r\nIndian jute mills appears in Fig. 20, showing particularly the wide\r\n\"pass\" between two long rows of spinning frames, and the method\r\nadopted of driving all the frames from a long line shaft. Spinning\r\nframes are usually double-sided, and each side may contain any\r\npracticable number of spindles; 64 to 80 spindles per side are\r\ncommon numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 20. AN INDIAN SPINNING FLAT]\r\n\r\nThe rove bobbins, several of which are clearly seen in Fig. 20, are\r\nbrought from the roving frame and placed on the iron pegs of a creel\r\n(often called a hake) near the top of the spinning frame-actually\r\nabove all moving parts of the machine. Each rove bobbin is free to\r\nrotate on its own peg as the rove from it is drawn downwards by the\r\nretaining rollers. The final drafting of the material takes place in\r\nthis frame, and a considerable amount of twist is imparted to the\r\ndrawn out material; the latter, now in the desired form and size of\r\nyarn, is wound simultaneously on to a suitable size and form of\r\nspinning bobbin.\r\n\r\nWhen the rove emerges from the retaining rollers it is passed over a\r\n\"breast-plate,\" and then is entered into the wide part of the\r\nconductor; it then leaves by the narrow part of the conductor by\r\nmeans of which part the rove is guided to the nip of the drawing\r\nrollers, The rove is, of course, drafted or drawn out between the\r\nretaining and drawing rollers according to the draft required, and\r\nthe fibrous material, now in thread size is placed in a slot of the\r\n\"thread-plate,\" then round the top of the flyer, round one of the\r\narms of the flyer, through the eye or palm at the end of the flyer\r\narm and on to the spinning bobbin. The latter is raised and lowered\r\nas in the roving frame by a builder motion, so that the yarn may be\r\ndistributed over the full range between the ends or flanges.\r\n\r\nEach spindle is driven separately by means of a tape or band which\r\npasses partially round the driving cylinder and the driven whorl of\r\nthe spindle, and a constant relation obtains between the delivery of\r\nthe yarn and the speed of the spindle during the operation of\r\nspinning any fixed count or type of yarn. In this connection, the\r\nparts resemble those in the roving frame, but from this point the\r\nfunctions of the two frames differ. The yarn has certainly to be\r\nwound upon the bobbin and at the same rate as it is delivered from\r\nthe drawing or delivery rollers, but in the spinning frame the bobbin,\r\nwhich rotates on the spindle, is not driven positively, as in the\r\nroving frame, by wheel gearing; each spinning bobbin is actually\r\ndriven by the yarn being pulled round by the arm of the flyer and\r\njust sufficient resistance is offered by the pressure or tension of\r\nthe \"temper band\" and weight. The temper band is simply a piece of\r\nleather or hemp twine to which is attached a weight, and the other\r\nend of the leather or twine is attached to the builder rail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21 A LINE OF SPINNING FRAMES]\r\n\r\nThe front part of the builder rail is provided with grooves into one\r\nof which the temper-band is placed so that the band itself is in\r\ncontact with a groove near the base of the bobbin flange. A varying\r\namount of resistance or tension on the bobbin is required in virtue\r\nof the varying size of the partially-filled bobbin, and this is\r\nobtained by placing the temper-band successively in different groves\r\nin the builder so that it will embrace a gradually increasing arc of\r\nthe spinning bobbin, and thus impart a heavier drag or tension.\r\n\r\nThe spinning frames in Fig. 20 are arranged with the ends of the\r\nframe parallel to the pass, whereas the end frames in Fig. 21 are at\r\nright angles to the pass, and hence an excellent view of the chief\r\nparts is presented. The full rove bobbins are seen distinctly on the\r\npegs of the creel in the upper part of the figure, and the rove\r\nyarns from these bobbins pass downwards, as already described, until\r\nthey ultimately enter the eyes of the flyer arms to be directed to\r\nand wound upon the spinning bobbins. The flyers--at one time termed\r\nthrostles--are clearly visible a little above the row of temper\r\nweights. The chief parts for raising the builder--cam lever,\r\nadjustable rod, chain and wheel--are illustrated at the end of the\r\nframe nearest the observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.  TWISTING AND REELING\r\n\r\nIn regard to cloth manufacture, most yarns are utilized in the form\r\nthey leave the spinning frame, that is, as single yarns. On the\r\nother hand, for certain branches of the trade, weaving included, it\r\nis necessary to take two, three, or more of these single yarns and to\r\ncombine them by a process technically termed twisting, and sometimes\r\n\"doubling\" when two single yarns only are combined.\r\n\r\nAlthough the commonest method, so far as weaving requirements go, is\r\nto twist two single yarns together to make a compound yarn, it is\r\nnot uncommon to combine a much higher number, indeed, sixteen or\r\nmore single yarns are often united for special purposes, but, when\r\nthis number is exceeded, the operation comes under the heading of\r\ntwines, ropes and the like. The twist or twine thus formed will have\r\nthe number of yarns regulated by the levelness and strength required\r\nfor the finished product. The same operation is conducted in the\r\nmaking of strands for cordage, but when a number of these twines are\r\nlaid-up or twisted together, the name cord or rope is used to\r\ndistinguish them.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Cordage and Cordage Hemp and Fibres_, by T.\r\nWoodhouse and P. Kilgour.]\r\n\r\nWhen two or three threads are united by twisting, the operation can\r\nbe conducted in a twisting frame which differs little from a\r\nordinary spinning frame, and hence need not be described. There may\r\nbe, however, appliances embodying some system of automatic stop\r\nmotion to bring the individual spindles to rest if one thread out of\r\nany group which are being combined happens to break. When several\r\nthreads have to be twisted together, special types of twisting\r\nframes are employed; these special machines are termed \"tube twisters,\"\r\nand the individual threads pass through holes suitably placed in a\r\nplate or disc before they reach the tube.\r\n\r\nMore or less elaborate methods of combining yarns are occasionally\r\nadopted, but the reader is advised to consult the above-mentioned\r\nwork on Cordage and similar literature for detailed information.\r\n\r\nWhen the yarn leaves the spinning frame, or the twisting frame, it\r\nis made up according to requirements, and the general operations\r\nwhich follow spinning and twisting are,--reeling, cop-winding, roll\r\nor spool winding, mill warping or link warping. The type or class of\r\nyarn, the purpose for which the yarn is to be used, or the equipment\r\nof the manufacturer, determines which of these methods should be\r\nused previous to despatching the yarn.\r\n\r\n_Reeling_. Reeling is a comparatively simple operation, consisting\r\nsolely of winding the yarns from the spinning or twisting bobbins on\r\nto a wide swift or reel of a suitable width and of a fixed diameter,\r\nor rather circumference. Indeed, the circumference of the reel was\r\nfixed by an Act of Convention of Estates, dating as far back as 1665\r\nand as under:\r\n\r\n\"That no linen yarn be exported under the pain of confiscation, half\r\nto the King and half to the attacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"That linen yarn be sold by weight and that no reel be shorter than\r\n_ten quarters_.\"\r\n\r\nThe same size of reel has been adopted for all jute yarns. All such\r\nyarns which are to be dyed, bleached, or otherwise treated must be\r\nreeled in order that the liquor may easily penetrate the threads\r\nwhich are obviously in a loose state. There are systems of dyeing\r\nand bleaching yarns in cop, roll or beam form, but these are not\r\nemployed much in the jute industry. Large quantities of jute yarns\r\nintended for export are reeled, partly because bundles form suitable\r\nbales for transport, and partly because of the varied operations and\r\nsizes of apparatus which obtain in foreign countries.\r\n\r\n        YARN TABLE FOR JUTE YARNS\r\n\r\n    90 inches,  or     2-1/2 yards    = 1 thread, or\r\n                                         the circumference of the reel\r\n   120 threads  or     300   yards    = 1 cut (or lea)\r\n     2 cuts     or     600   yards    = 1 heer\r\n    12 cuts     or   3,600   yards    = 1 standard hank\r\n    48 cuts     or  14,400   yards    = 1 spyndle\r\n\r\nSince jute yarns are comparatively thick, it is only the very finest\r\nyarns which contain 12 cuts per hank. The bulk of the yarn is made\r\nup into 6-cut hanks. If the yarn should be extra thick, even 6 cuts\r\nare too many to be combined, and one finds groups of 4 cuts, 3 cuts,\r\n2 cuts, and even 1 cut. A convenient name for any group less than 12\r\ncuts is a \"mill-hank,\" because the number used is simply one of\r\nconvenience to enable the mill-hank to be satisfactorily placed on\r\nthe swift in the winding frame.\r\n\r\nThe reeling operation is useful in that it enables one to measure\r\nthe length of the yarn; indeed, the operation of reeling, or forming\r\nthe yarn into cuts and hanks, has always been used as the method of\r\ndesignating the count, grist or number of the yarn. We have already\r\nseen that the count of jute yarn is determined by the weight in lbs.\r\nof one spyndle (14,400 yds.).\r\n\r\nFor 8 lb. per spyndle yarn, and for other yarns of about the same\r\ncount, it is usual to have provision for 24 spinning bobbins on the\r\nreel. As the reel rotates, the yarn from these 24 bobbins is wound\r\nround, say,\r\n\r\n6 in. apart, and when the reel has made 120 revolutions, or 120\r\nthreads at each place from each bobbin, there will be 24 separate\r\ncuts of yarn on the reel. When 120 threads have been reeled as\r\nmentioned, a bell rings to warn the attendant that the cuts are\r\ncomplete; the reel is then stopped, and a \"lease-band\" is tied round\r\neach group of 120 threads.\r\n\r\nA guide rod moves the thread guide laterally and slowly as the\r\nreeling operation is proceeding so that each thread or round may be\r\nin close proximity to its neighbour without riding on it, and this\r\nmovement of the thread extends to approximately 6 in., to accommodate\r\nthe 6 cuts which are to form the mill-hank.\r\n\r\nEach time the reel has made 120 revolutions and the bell rings, the\r\nreeler ties up the several cuts in the width, so that when the\r\nmill-hank is complete, each individual cut will be distinct. In some\r\ncase, the two threads of the lease-band instead of being tied, are\r\nsimply crossed and recrossed at each cut, without of course breaking\r\nthe yarn which is being reeled, although effectively separating the\r\ncuts. At the end of the operation (when the quantity of cuts for the\r\nmill-hank has been reeled) the ends of the lease-band are tied.\r\n\r\nThe object of the lease-band is for facilitating the operation of\r\nwinding, and for enabling the length to be checked with approximate\r\ncorrectness.\r\n\r\nWhen the reel has been filled with, say, twenty-four 6-cut hanks,\r\nthere will evidently be 3 spyndles of yarn on the reel. The 24\r\nmill-hanks are then slipped off the end of the reel, and the hanks\r\ntaken to the bundling stool or frame. Here they, along with others\r\nof the same count, are made up into bundles which weigh from 54 lb.\r\nto 60 lb. according to the count of the yarn. Each bundle contains a\r\nnumber of complete hanks, and it is unusual to split a hank for the\r\npurpose of maintaining an absolutely standard weight bundle. Indeed,\r\nthe bundles contain an even number of hanks, so that while there\r\nwould be exactly 56 lb. per bundle of 7 lb. yarn, or 8 lb. yarn,\r\nthere would be 60 lb in a bundle of 7-1/2 lb. yarn, and 54 lb.\r\nin a bundle of 9 lb. yarn.\r\n\r\nThe chief point in reeling is to ensure that the correct number of\r\nthreads is in each cut, i.e. to obtain a \"correct tell\"; this ideal\r\ncondition may be impracticable in actual work, but it is wise to\r\napproach it as closely as possible. Careless workers allow the reel\r\nto run on after one or more spinning bobbins are empty, and this\r\nyields what is known as \"short tell.\" It is not uncommon to\r\nintroduce a bell wheel with, say, 123 or 124 teeth, instead of the\r\nnominal 120 teeth, to compensate for this defect in reeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.  WINDING: ROLLS AND COPS\r\n\r\nThe actual spinning and twisting operations being thus completed,\r\nthe yarns are ready to be combined either for more elaborate types\r\nof twist, or for the processes of cloth manufacture. In its simplest\r\ndefinition, a fabric consists of two series of threads interlaced in\r\nsuch way as to form a more or less solid and compact structure. The\r\ntwo series of threads which are interlaced receive the technical\r\nterms of warp and weft--in poetical language, warp and woof. The\r\nthreads which form the length of the cloth constitute the warp,\r\nwhile the transverse threads are the weft.\r\n\r\nThe warp threads have ultimately to be wound or \"beamed\" on to a\r\nlarge roller, termed a weaver's beam, while the weft yarn has to be\r\nprepared in suitable shape for the shuttle. These two distinct\r\nconditions necessitate two general types of winding:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Spool winding or bobbin winding for the warp yarns.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Cop winding or pirn winding for the weft yarns.\r\n\r\nFor the jute trade, the bulk of the warp yarn is wound from the\r\nspinning bobbin on to large rolls or spools which contain from 7 to\r\n8 lb. of yarn; the weft is wound from the spinning bobbin into cops\r\nwhich weigh approximately 4 to 8 ounces.\r\n\r\nOriginally all jute yarns for warp were wound on to flanged bobbins\r\nvery similar to, but larger than, those which are at present used\r\nfor the linen trade. The advent of the roll-winding machine marked a\r\ngreat advance in the method of winding warp yarns as compared with\r\nthe bobbin winding method; indeed, in the jute trade, the latter are\r\nused only for winding from hank those yarns which have been bleached,\r\ndyed or similarly treated. Fig. 22 illustrates one of the modern\r\nbobbin winding machines for jute made by Messrs. Charles Parker,\r\nSons & Co., Dundee. The finished product is illustrated by two full\r\nbobbins on the stand and close to a single empty bobbin. There are\r\nalso two full bobbins in the winding position, and several hanks of\r\nyarn on the swifts. Each bobbin is driven by means of two discs, and\r\nsince the drive is by surface contact between the discs and the\r\nbobbin, an almost constant speed is imparted to the yarn throughout\r\nthe process. An automatic stop motion is provided for each bobbin;\r\nthis apparatus lifts the bobbin clear of the discs when the bobbin\r\nis filled as exemplified in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the flanges of the bobbin is, obviously, a\r\nfixed one in any one machine, and the diameter over the yarn is\r\nlimited. On the other hand, rolls may be made of varying widths and\r\nany suitable diameter. And while a bobbin holds about 2 lb. of yarn,\r\na common size of roll weighs, as already stated, from 7 to 8 lb.\r\nSuch a roll measures, about 9 in. long and 8 in. diameter; hence for\r\n8 lb. yarn, the roll capacity is 14,400 yards.\r\n\r\nRolls very much larger than the above are made on special machines\r\nadopted to wind about six rolls as shown in Fig. 23. It is built\r\nspecially for winding heavy or thick yarns into rolls of 15 in.\r\ndiameter and 14 in. length, and this particular machine is used\r\nmostly by rope makers and carpet manufacturers. One roll only is\r\nshown in the illustration, and it is winding the material from a 10\r\nin. x 5 in. rove bobbin. The rove is drawn forward by surface or\r\nfrictional contact between the roll itself and a rapidly rotating\r\ndrum. The yarn guide is moved rapidly from side to side by means of\r\nthe grooved cam on the left, the upright lever fulcrumed near the\r\nfloor, and the horizontal rod which passes in front of the rolls and\r\nupon which are fixed the actual yarn guides. This rapid traverse,\r\ncombined with the rotation of the rolls, enables the yarn to be\r\nsecurely built upon a paper or wooden tube; no flanges are required,\r\nand hence the initial cost as well as the upkeep of the foundations\r\nfor rolls is much below that for bobbins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.\r\nFIG. 22 BOBBIN WINDING MACHINE WITH HANKS]\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same principles are adopted for winding the ordinary 9\r\nin. x 8 in. or 8 in. x 7 in. rolls for the warping and dressing\r\ndepartments. These rolls are made direct from the yarn on spinning\r\nbobbins, but the machines are usually double-sided, each side having\r\ntwo tiers; a common number of spools for one machine is 80.\r\n\r\nThe double tier on each side is practicable because of the small\r\nspace required for the spinning bobbins. When, however, rolls are\r\nwound from hank, as is illustrated in Fig. 24, and as practised in\r\nseveral foreign countries even for grey yarn, one row only at each\r\nside is possible. Both types are made by each machine maker, the one\r\nillustrated in Fig. 24 being the product of Messrs. Charles Parker,\r\nSons & Co., Dundee.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the yarns are built upon tubes as mentioned, the\r\nwooden ones weighing only a few ounces and being practically\r\nindestructible, besides being very convenient for transit; indeed it\r\nlooks highly probable that the use of these articles will still\r\nfurther reduce the amount of yarn exported in bundle form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23 ROLL WINDER FOR LARGE ROLLS _By permission of\r\nMessrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd_.]\r\n\r\nThe machine illustrated in Fig. 24, as well as those by other makers,\r\nis very compact, easily adjustable to wind different sizes of rolls,\r\ncan be run at a high speed, and possesses automatic stop motions,\r\none for each roll.\r\n\r\nA full roll and a partially-filled roll are clearly seen. A recent\r\nimprovement in the shape of a new yarn drag device, and an automatic\r\nstop when the yarn breaks or the yarn on the bobbin is exhausted,\r\nhas just been introduced on to the Combe-Barbour frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24 ROLL WINDING MACHINE (FROM HANKS) _By\r\npermission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.]\r\n\r\nWeft Winding. A few firms wind jute weft yarn from the spinning\r\nbobbins on to pirns (wooden centres). The great majority of\r\nmanufacturers, however, use cops for the loom shuttles. The cops are\r\nalmost invariably wound direct from the spinning bobbins, the\r\nexception being coloured yarn which is wound from hank. There are\r\ndifferent types of machines used for cop winding, but in every case\r\nthe yarn is wound upon a bare spindle, and the yarn guide has a\r\nrapid traverse in order to obtain the well-known cross-wind so\r\nnecessary for making a stable cop. The disposition of the cops in\r\nthe winding operation is vertical, but while in some machines the\r\ntapered nose of the cop is in the high position and the spinning\r\nbobbin from which the yarn is being drawn is in the low position, in\r\nother machines these conditions are opposite. Thus, in the cop\r\nwinding frame made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd., Arbroath,\r\nand illustrated in Fig. 25, the spinning bobbins are below the cops,\r\nthe tapered noses of the latter are upwards in their cones or shapers,\r\nand the yarn guides are near the top of the machine. This view shows\r\nabout three-fourths of the full width of a 96-spindle machine, 48\r\nspindles on each side, two practically full-length cops and one\r\npartially built. The illustration in Fig. 26 is the above-mentioned\r\nopposite type, and the one most generally adopted, with the spinning\r\nbobbins as shown near the top of the frame, the yarn guides in the\r\nlow position, and the point or tapered nose of the cop pointing\r\ndownwards. Six spindles only appear in this view, which represents\r\nthe machine made by Messrs.

Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd_.\r\nFIG. 25 COP WINDING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe spindles of cop machines are gear driven as shown clearly in Fig.\r\n26; the large skew bevel wheels are keyed to the main shaft, while\r\nthe small skew bevel wheels are loose on their respective spindles.\r\nThe upper face of each small skew bevel wheel forms one part of a\r\nclutch; the other part of the clutch is slidably mounted on the\r\nspindle. When the two parts of the clutch are separated, as they are\r\nwhen the yarn breaks or runs slack, when it is exhausted, or when\r\nthe cop reaches a predetermined length, the spindle stops; but when\r\nthe two parts of the clutch are in contact, the small skew bevel\r\nwheel drives the clutch, the latter rotates the spindle, and the\r\nspindle in turn draws forward the yarn from the bobbin, and in\r\nconjunction with the rapidly moving yarn guide and the inner surface\r\nof the cone imparts in rapid succession new layers on the nose of\r\nthe cop, and thus the formed layers of the latter increase the\r\nlength proportionately to the amount of yarn drawn on, and the\r\npartially completed cop moves slowly away from its cup or cone until\r\nthe desired length is obtained when the spindle is automatically\r\nstopped and the winding for that particular spindle ceases. Cops may\r\nbe made of any length and any suitable diameter; a common size for\r\njute shuttle is 10 in. long, and 1-5/8 in. diameter, and the\r\nangle formed by the two sides of the cone is approximately 30 degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 26 COP WINDING MACHINE _By permission of Messrs.\r\nUrquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.  WARPING, BEAMING AND DRESSING\r\n\r\nThere are a few distinct methods of preparing warp threads on the\r\nweaver's beam. Stated briefly, the chief methods are--\r\n\r\n1. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a warping mill, and\r\nwhen the completed chain is removed from the mill it is transferred\r\non to the weaver's beam.\r\n\r\n2. The warp is made in the form of a chain on a linking machine, and\r\nthen beamed on to a weaver's beam.\r\n\r\n3. The warp yarns are wound or beamed direct from the large\r\ncylindrical \"rolls\" or \"spools\" on to a weaver's beam.\r\n\r\n4. The warp yarns are starched, dried and beamed simultaneously on\r\nto a weaver's beam.\r\n\r\nThe last method is the most extensively adapted; but we shall\r\ndescribe the four processes briefly, and in the order mentioned.\r\n\r\nFor mill warping, as in No. 1 method, from 50 to 72 full spinning\r\nbobbins are placed in the bank or creel as illustrated to the right\r\nof each large circular warping mill in Fig. 27. The ends of the\r\nthreads from these bobbins are drawn through the eyes of two leaves\r\nof the \"heck,\" and all the ends tied together. The heck, or\r\napparatus for forming what is known as the weaver's lease, drawer's\r\nlease, or thread-by-thread lease, is shown clearly between the\r\nbobbin bank and the female warper in the foreground of the\r\nillustration. The heck is suspended by means of cords, or chains,\r\nand so ranged that when the warping mill is rotated in one direction\r\nthe heck is lowered gradually between suitable slides, while when\r\nthe mill is rotated in the opposite direction the heck is raised\r\ngradually between the same slides. These movements are necessary in\r\norder that the threads from the bobbins may be arranged spirally\r\nround the mill and as illustrated clearly on all the mills in the\r\nfigure. The particular method of arranging the ropes, or the gearing\r\nif chains are used, determines the distance between each pair of\r\nspirals; a common distance is about 1-1/2 in. There are about\r\n42 spirals or rounds on the nearest mill in Fig. 27, and this number\r\nmultiplied by the circumference of the mill represents the length of\r\nthe warp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27 A ROW OF MODERN WARPING MILLS]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement, the heck is at the top, and when the weaver's\r\nlease has been formed on the three pins near the top of the mill\r\nwith the 50 to 72 threads (often 56), the mill is rotated by means\r\nof the handle and its connections shown near the bottom of the mill.\r\nAs the mill rotates, the heck with the threads descends gradually\r\nand thus the group of threads is disposed spirally on the vertical\r\nspokes of the mill until the desired length of the warp is reached.\r\nA beamer's lease or \"pin lease\" is now made on the two lower pegs;\r\nthere may be two, three, four or more threads in each group of the\r\npin lease; a common number is 7 to 9. When this pin lease has been\r\nformed, one section of the warp has been made, the proportion\r\nfinished being (50 to 72)/x where x is the total number of threads\r\nrequired for the cloth. The same kind of lease must again be made on\r\nthe same two pins at the bottom for the beginning of the next\r\nsection of 50 to 72 threads, and the mill rotated in the opposite\r\ndirection in order to draw up the heck, and to cause the second\r\ngroup of 50 to 72 threads to be arranged spirally and in close touch\r\nwith the threads of the first group. When the heck reaches the top of\r\nthe mill, the single-thread lease is again made, all the threads\r\npassed round the end pin, and then all is ready for repeating the\r\nsame two operations until the requisite number of threads has been\r\nintroduced on to the mill. If it is impossible to accommodate all the\r\nthreads for the cloth on the mill, the warp is made in two or more\r\nparts or chains. It will be noticed that the heck for the nearest\r\nmill is opposite about the 12th round of threads from the bobbin,\r\nwhereas the heck for the second mill is about the same distance from\r\nthe top. A completed warp or chain is being bundled up opposite the\r\nthird mill. When the warp is completed it is pulled off the mill and\r\nsimultaneously linked into a chain.\r\n\r\nA very similar kind of warp can be made more quickly, and often\r\nbetter, on what is termed the linking machine mentioned in No. 2\r\nmethod. Such a machine is illustrated in Fig. 28, and the full\r\nequipment demands the following four distinct kinds of apparatus--a\r\nbank capable of holding approximately 300 spools, a frame for\r\nforming the weaver's lease and the beamer's lease, machine for\r\ndrawing the threads from the spools in the bank and for measuring\r\nthe length and marking the warp at predetermined intervals, and\r\nfinally the actual machine which links the group of threads in the\r\nform of a chain.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 28 part of the large bank, with a few rows of spools, is\r\nshown in the extreme background. The two sets of threads, from the\r\ntwo wings of the bank, are seen distinctly, and the machine or frame\r\nimmediately in front of the bank is where the two kinds of lease are\r\nmade when desired, i.e. at the beginning and at the end of the warp.\r\nBetween this leasing frame and the linking machine proper, shown in\r\nthe foreground, is the drawing, measuring and marking machine. Only\r\npart of this machine is seen--the driving pulleys and part of the\r\nframe adjoining them. All these frames and machines are necessary,\r\nbut the movements embodied in them, or the functions which they\r\nperform, are really subsidiary to those of the linker shown in the\r\nforeground of Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28 POWER CHAIN OF WARP LINKING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nAlthough the linking machine is composed of only a few parts, it is\r\na highly-ingenious combination of mechanical parts; these parts\r\nconvert the straight running group of 300 threads into a linked chain,\r\nand the latter is shown distinctly descending from the chute on to\r\nthe floor in the figure. Precisely the same kind of link is made by\r\nthe hand wrappers when the warps indicated in Fig. 27 are being\r\nwithdrawn from the mills. Two completed chains are shown tied up in\r\nFig. 28, and a stock of rolls or spools appear against the wall near\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nThe completed chain from the warping mill or the linking machine is\r\nnow taken to the beaming frame, and after the threads, or rather the\r\nsmall groups of threads, in the pin lease have been disposed in a\r\nkind of coarse comb or reed, termed an veneer or radial, and\r\narranged to occupy the desired width in the veneer, they are\r\nattached in some suitable way to the weaver's beam. The chain is\r\nheld taut, and weights applied to the presser on the beam while the\r\nlatter is rotated. In this way a solid compact beam of yarn is\r\nobtained. The end of the warp--that one that goes on to the beam\r\nlast--contains the weaver's lease, and when the completed beam is\r\nremoved from the beaming or winding-on frame, this single-thread\r\nlease enables the next operative to select the threads individually\r\nand to draw the threads, usually single, but sometimes in pairs, in\r\nwhich case the lease would be in pairs, through the eyes of the\r\ncamas or HEALDS, or to select them for the purpose of tying them to\r\nthe ends of the warp in the loom, that is to the \"thrum\" of a cloth\r\nwhich has been completed.\r\n\r\nInstead of first making a warp or chain on the warping mill, or on\r\nthe linking machine, and then beaming such warp on to the weaver's\r\nbeam or loom beam as already described, two otherwise distinct\r\nprocesses of warping and beaming may be conducted simultaneously.\r\nThus, the total number of threads required for the manufacture of any\r\nparticular kind of cloth--unless the number of threads happens to be\r\nvery high--may be wound on to the loom beam direct from the spools.\r\nSay, for example, a warp was required to be 600 yards long, and that\r\nthere should be 500 threads in all. Five hundred spools of warp yarn\r\nwould be placed in the two wings of a V-shaped bank, and the threads\r\nfrom these spools taken in regular order, and threaded through the\r\nsplits or openings of a reed which is placed in a suitable position\r\nin regard to the winding-on mechanism. Some of the machines which\r\nperform the winding-on of the yarn are comparatively simple, while\r\nothers are more or less complicated. In some the loom beam rotates\r\nat a fixed number of revolutions per minute, while in others the\r\nbeam rotates at a gradually decreasing number of revolutions per\r\nminute. One of the latter types made by MESSRS Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,\r\nLtd., Dundee, is illustrated in Fig. 29, and the mechanism displayed\r\nis identical with that employed for No. 4 method of preparing warps.\r\n\r\nThe V-shaped bank with its complement of spools (500 in our example)\r\nwould occupy a position immediately to the left of Fig. 29. The\r\nthreads would pass through a reed and then in a straight wide sheet\r\nbetween the pair of rollers, these parts being contained in the\r\nsupplementary frame on the left. A similar frame appears on the\r\nextreme right of the figure, and this would be used in conjunction\r\nwith another V-shaped bank, not shown, but which would occupy a\r\nposition further to the right, i.e. if one bank was not large enough\r\nto hold the required number of spools. The part on the extreme right\r\ncan be ignored at present.\r\n\r\nThe threads are arranged in exactly the same way as indicated in Fig.\r\n28 from the bank to the reed in front of the rollers in Fig. 29,\r\nand on emerging from the pair of rollers are taken across the\r\nstretch between the supplementary frame and the main central frame,\r\nand attached to the weavers beam just below the pressing rollers. It\r\nmay be advisable to have another reed just before the beam, so that\r\nthe width occupied by the threads in the beam may be exactly the\r\nsame as the width between the two flanges of the loom beam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29 WINDING-ON OR DRY BEAMING MACHINE _By\r\npermission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co. Ltd_.]\r\n\r\nThe speed of the threads is determined by the surface speed of the\r\ntwo rollers in the supplementary frame, the bottom roller being\r\npositively driven from the central part through the long horizontal\r\nshaft and a train of wheels caged in as shown. The loom beam, which\r\nis seen clearly immediately below the pressing rollers, is driven by\r\nfriction because the surface speed of the yarn must be constant;\r\nhence, as the diameter over the yarn on the beam increases, the\r\nrevolutions per minute of the beam must decrease, and a varying\r\namount of slip takes place between the friction-discs and their\r\nflannels.\r\n\r\nAs the loom beam rotates, the threads are arranged in layers between\r\nthe flanges of the loom beam. Thus, the 500 threads would be\r\narranged side by side, perhaps for a width of 45 to 46 in., and\r\nbridging the gap between the flanges of the beam; the latter is thus,\r\nto all intents and purposes, a very large bobbin upon which 500\r\nthreads are wound at the same time, instead of one thread as in the\r\nordinary but smaller bobbin or reel. It will be understood that in\r\nthe latter case the same thread moves from side to side in order to\r\nbridge the gap, whereas in the former case each thread maintains a\r\nfixed position in the width.\r\n\r\nThe last and most important method of making a warp, No. 4 method,\r\nfor the weaver is that where, in addition to the simultaneous\r\nprocesses of warping and beaming as exemplified in the last example,\r\nall the threads are coated with some suitable kind of starch or size\r\nimmediately they reach the two rollers shown in the supplementary\r\nframe in Fig. 29. The moistened threads must, however, be dried\r\nbefore they reach the loom beam. When a warp is starched, dried and\r\nbeamed simultaneously, it is said to be \"dressed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the modern dressing machine, such as that illustrated in Fig. 30,\r\nthere are six steam-heated cylinders to dry the starched yarns\r\nbefore the latter reach the loom beams. Both banks, or rather part\r\nof both, can be seen in this view, from which some idea will be\r\nformed of the great length occupied. Several of the threads from the\r\nspools in the left bank are seen converging towards the back reed,\r\nthen they pass between the two rollers--the bottom one of which is\r\npartially immersed in the starch trough--and forward to the second\r\nreed. After the sheet of threads leaves the second reed, it passes\r\npartially round a small guide roller, then almost wholly round each\r\nof three cylinders arranged °o°, and finally on to the loom beam.\r\nEach cylinder is 4 feet diameter, and three of them occupy a\r\nposition between the left supplementary frame, and the central frame\r\nin Fig. 29, while the remaining three cylinders are similarly\r\ndisposed between the central frame and the supplementary frame of\r\nthe right in the same illustration.\r\n\r\nThe number of steam-heated cylinders, and their diameter, depend\r\nsomewhat upon the type of yarn to be dressed, and upon the speed\r\nwhich it is desired to run the yarn. A common speed for\r\nordinary-sized jute is from 18 to 22 yards per minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30 A MODERN YARN DRESSING MACHINE WITH SIX\r\nSTEAM-HEATED CYLINDERS]\r\n\r\nA different way of arranging the cylinders is exemplified in Fig. 31.\r\nThis view, which illustrates a machine made by Messrs. Charles Parker,\r\nSons & Co., Dundee, has been introduced to show that if the warps\r\nunder preparation contain a comparatively few threads, or if the\r\nbanks are made larger than usual, two warps may be dressed at the\r\nsame time. In such a case, three cylinders only would be used for\r\neach warp, and the arrangement would be equivalent to two single\r\ndressing machines. The two weaver's beams, with their pressing\r\nrollers, are shown plainly in the centre of the illustration. Some\r\nmachines have four cylinders, others have six, while a few have eight.\r\nA very similar machine to that illustrated in Fig. 31 is made so that\r\nall the six cylinders may be used to dry yarns from two banks, and\r\nall the yarns wound on to one weaver's beam, or all the yarns may be\r\nwound on to one of the beams in the machine in Fig. 31 if the number\r\nof threads is too many for one bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31 DRESSING MACHINE FOR PREPARING TWO WARPS\r\nSIMULTANEOUSLY _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.]\r\n\r\nSuppose it is desired to make a warp of 700 threads instead of 500,\r\nas in the above example; then 350 spools would be placed in each of\r\nthe two banks, the threads disposed as already described to use as\r\nmuch of the heating surface of the cylinder as possible, and one\r\nsheet of threads passed partially round what is known as a measuring\r\nroller. Both sheets of threads unite into one sheet at the centre of\r\nthe machine in Fig. 31, and pass in this form on to one of the loom\r\nbeams.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the lower roller in the starch box\r\nis positively driven by suitable mechanism from the central part of\r\nthe machine, Fig. 29, while the upper roller, see Fig. 30, is a\r\npressing roller and is covered with cloth, usually of a flannel type.\r\nBetween the two rollers the sheet of 350 threads passes, becomes\r\nimpregnated with the starch which is drawn up by the surface of the\r\nlower roller, and the superfluous quantity is squeezed out and\r\nreturns to the trough, or joins that which is already moving upwards\r\ntowards the nip of the rollers. The yarn emerges from the rollers\r\nand over the cylinders at a constant speed, which may be chosen to\r\nsuit existing conditions, and it must also be wound on to the loom\r\nbeam at the same rate. But since the diameter of the beam increases\r\neach revolution by approximately twice the diameter of the thread,\r\nit is necessary to drive the beam by some kind of differential motion.\r\n\r\nThe usual way in machines for dressing jute yarns is to drive the\r\nbeam support and the beam by means of friction plates. A certain\r\namount of slip is always taking place--the drive is designed for\r\nthis purpose--and the friction plates are adjusted by the yarn\r\ndresser during the operation of dressing to enable them to draw\r\nforward the beam, and to slip in infinitesimal sections, so that the\r\nyarn is drawn forward continuously and at uniform speed.\r\n\r\nDuring the operation, the measuring roller and its subsequent train\r\nof wheels and shafts indicates the length of yarn which has passed\r\nover, also the number of \"cuts\" or \"pieces\" of any desired length; in\r\naddition, part of the measuring and marking mechanism uses an\r\nink-pad to mark the yarn at the end of each cut, such mark to act as\r\na guide for the weaver, and to indicate the length of warp which has\r\nbeen woven. Thus if the above warp were intended to be five cuts,\r\neach 120 yards, or 600 yards in all, the above apparatus would\r\nmeasure and indicate the yards and cuts, and would introduce a mark\r\nat intervals of 120 yards on some of the threads. And all this is\r\ndone without stopping the machine. At the time of marking, or\r\nimmediately before or after, just as desired, a bell is made to ring\r\nautomatically so that the attendant is warned when the mark on the\r\nwarp is about to approach the loom beam. This bell is shown in Fig.\r\n29, near the right-hand curved outer surface of the central frame.\r\n\r\nAs in hand warping or in linking, a single-thread lease is made at\r\nthe end of the desired length of warp, or else what is known as a\r\npair of \"clasp-rods\" is arranged to grip the sheet of warp threads.\r\n\r\nAfter the loom beam, with its length of warp, has been removed from\r\nthe machine, the threads are either drawn through the eyes or mails\r\nof the cambs (termed gears, healds or heddles in other districts)\r\nand through the weaving reed, or else they are tied to the ends of\r\nthe threads of the previous warp which, with the weft, has been\r\nwoven into cloth. These latter threads are still intact in the cambs\r\nand reed in the loom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.  TYING-ON, DRAWING-IN, AND WEAVING\r\n\r\nIf all the threads of the newly-dressed warp can be tied on to the\r\nends of the warp which has been woven, it is only necessary, when\r\nthe tying-on process is completed, to rotate the loom beam slowly,\r\nand simultaneously to draw forward the threads until all the knots\r\nhave passed through the cambs and the reed, and sufficiently far\r\nforward to be clear of the latter when it approaches its full forward,\r\nor beating up, position during the operation of weaving.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the threads of the newly-dressed, or\r\nnewly-beamed, warp had to be drawn-in and reeded, these operations\r\nwould be performed in the drawing-in and reeding department, and,\r\nwhen completed, the loom beam with its attached warp threads, cambs\r\nand reed, would be taken bodily to the loom where the \"tenter,\"\r\n\"tackler\" or \"tuner\" adjusts all the parts preparatory to the actual\r\noperation of weaving. The latter work is often termed \"gaiting a web.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a great similarity in many of the operations of weaving the\r\nsimpler types of cloth, although there may be a considerable\r\ndifference in the appearance of the cloths themselves. In nearly all\r\nthe various branches of the textile industry the bulk of the work in\r\nthe weaving departments of such branches consists of the manufacture\r\nof comparatively simple fabrics. Thus, in the jute industry, there\r\nare four distinct types of cloth which predominate over all others;\r\nthese types are known respectively as hessian, bagging, tarpauling\r\nand sacking. In addition to these main types, there are several\r\nother simple types the structure of which is identical with one or\r\nother of the above four; while finally there are the more elaborate\r\ntypes of cloth which are embodied in the various structures of\r\ncarpets and the like.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to discuss the various makes in a work of\r\nthis kind; the commoner types are described in _Jute and Linen\r\nWeaving Calculations and Structure of Fabrics_; and the more\r\nelaborate ones, as well as several types of simple ones, appear in\r\n_Textile Design: Pure and Applied_, both by T. Woodhouse and T.\r\nMilne.\r\n\r\nSix distinct types of jute fabrics are illustrated in Fig. 32. The\r\ntechnical characteristics of each are as follows--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32 SIX DISTINCT KINDS OF TYPICAL JUTE FABRICS]\r\n\r\nH.--An ordinary \"HESSIAN\" cloth made from comparatively fine single\r\n  warp and single weft, and the threads interlaced in the simplest\r\n  order, termed \"plain weave.\" A wide range of cloths is made from the\r\n  scrims or net-like fabrics to others more closely woven than that\r\n  illustrated.\r\n\r\nB.--A \"BAGGING\" made from comparatively fine single warp arranged in\r\n  pairs and then termed \"double warp.\" The weft is thick, and the\r\n  weave is also plain.\r\n\r\nT.--A \"TARPAULING\" made from yarns similar to those in bagging,\r\n  although there is a much wider range in the thickness of the weft.\r\n  It is a much finer cloth than the typical bagging, but otherwise the\r\n  structures are identical.\r\n\r\nS.--A striped \"SACKING\" made from comparatively fine warp yarns,\r\n  usually double as in bagging, but occasionally single, with medium\r\n  or thick weft interwoven in 3-leaf or 4-leaf twill order. The weaves\r\n  are shown in Fig. 33.\r\n\r\nC.--One type of \"CARPET\" cloth made exclusively from two-ply or\r\n  two-fold coloured warp yarns, and thick black single weft yarns. The\r\n  threads and picks are interwoven in two up, two down twill, directed\r\n  to right and then to left, and thus forming a herring-bone pattern,\r\n  or arrow-head pattern.\r\n\r\nP.-An uncut pile fabric known as \"BRUSSELLETTE.\" The figuring warp\r\n  is composed of dyed and printed yarns mixed to form an indefinite\r\n  pattern, and works in conjunction with a ground warp and weft. The\r\n  weave is again plain, although the structure of the fabric is quite\r\n  different from the other plain cloths illustrated. The cloth is\r\n  reversible, the two sides being similar structure but differing\r\n  slightly in colour ornamentation.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, there are several degrees of fineness or\r\ncoarseness in all the groups, particularly in the types marked H, B,\r\nT and S. The structure or weave in all varieties of any one group is\r\nconstant and as stated.\r\n\r\nAll the weaves are illustrated in the usual technical manner in Fig.\r\n33, and the relation between the simplest of these weaves and the\r\nyarns of the cloth is illustrated in Fig. 34. In Fig. 33, the unit\r\nweaves in A, B, C, D, E and F are shown in solid squares, while the\r\nrepetitions of the units in each case are represented by the dots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33 POINT-PAPER DESIGNS SHOWING WEAVERS FOR\r\nVARIOUS CLOTHS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34 DIAGRAMMATIC VIEWS OF THE STRUCTURE OF PLAIN\r\nCLOTH]\r\n\r\nA is the plain weave, 16 units shown, and used for fabrics H and P,\r\nFig. 32.\r\n\r\nB is the double warp plain wave, 8 units shown, and shows the method\r\nof interlacing the yarns h patterns B and T, Fig. 32. When the warp\r\nis made double as indicated in weave _B_, the effect in the cloth\r\ncan be produced by using the mechanical arrangements employed for\r\nweave _A_. Hence, the cloths _H_, _B_ and _T_ can be woven without\r\nany mechanical alteration in the loom.\r\n\r\n_C_ is the 3-leaf double warp sacking weave and shows 4 units;\r\nsince each pair of vertical rows of small squares consists of two\r\nidentical single rows, they may be represented as at _D_. The actual\r\nstructure of the cloth _S_ in Fig. 32 is represented on design paper\r\nat _C_, Fig. 33.\r\n\r\n_D_ is the single warp 3-leaf sacking weave, 4 units shown, but\r\nthe mechanical parts for weaving both _C_ and _D_ remain constant.\r\n\r\n_E_ is the double warp 4-leaf sacking, 2 units shown, while\r\n\r\n_F_ is the single warp 4-leaf sacking, 4 units shown.\r\n\r\nThe patterns or cloths for _E_ and _F_ are not illustrated.\r\n\r\n_G_ is a \"herring-bone\" design on 24 threads and 4 picks, two\r\nunits shown. It is typical of the pattern represented at _C_, Fig. 32,\r\nand involves the use of 4 leaves in the loom.\r\n\r\nThe solid squares in weave _A_, Fig. 33, are reproduced in the\r\nleft-hand bottom corner of Fig. 34. A diagrammatic plan of a plain\r\ncloth produced by this simple order of interlacing is exhibited in\r\nthe upper part by four shaded threads of warp and four black picks\r\nof weft (the difference is for distinction only). The left-hand\r\nintersection shows one thread interweaving with all the four picks,\r\nwhile the bottom intersection shows all the four threads\r\ninterweaving with one pick. The two arrows from the weave or design\r\nto the thread and pick respectively show the connection, and it will\r\nbe seen that a mark (solid) on the design represents a warp thread\r\non the surface of the cloth, while a blank square represents a weft\r\nshot on the surface, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nA weaving shed full of various types of looms, and all driven by\r\nbelts from an overhead shaft, is illustrated in Fig. 35. The loom in\r\nthe foreground is weaving a 3-leaf sacking similar to that\r\nillustrated at _S_, Fig. 32. while the appearance of a full weaver's\r\nwarp beam is shown distinctly in the second loom in Fig. 35. There\r\nare hundreds of looms in this modern weaving shed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35 WEAVING SHED WITH BELT-DRIVEN LOOMS]\r\n\r\nDuring the operation of weaving, the shuttle, in which is placed a\r\ncop of weft, similar to that on the cop winding machine in Fig. 25,\r\nand with the end of the weft threaded through the eye of the shuttle,\r\nis driven alternately from side to side of the cloth through the\r\nopening or \"shed\" formed by two layers of the warp. The positions of\r\nthe threads in these two layers are represented by the designs, see\r\nFig. 33, and while one layer occupies a high position in the loom\r\nthe other layer occupies a low position. The threads of the warp are\r\nplaced in these two positions by the leaves of the camb (termed\r\nhealds and also gears in other districts) and it is between these\r\ntwo layers that the shuttle passes, forms a selvage at the edge each\r\ntime it makes a journey across, and leaves a trail or length of weft\r\neach journey. The support or lay upon which the shuttle travels\r\nmoves back to provide room for the shuttle to pass between the two\r\nlayers of threads, and after the shuttle reaches the end of each\r\njourney, the lay with the reed comes forward again, and thus pushes\r\nsuccessively the shots of weft into close proximity with the ones\r\nwhich preceded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36 LOOMS DRIVEN WITH INDIVIDUAL MOTORS _By\r\npermission of The English Electric Co., Ltd._]\r\n\r\nThe order of lifting and depressing the threads of the warp is, as\r\nalready stated, demonstrated on the design paper in Fig. 33, and the\r\nselected order determines, in the simplest cases, the pattern on the\r\nsurface of the cloth when the warp and weft yarns are of the same\r\ncolour. A great diversity of pattern can be obtained by the method\r\nof interlacing the two sets of yarn, and a still greater variety of\r\npattern is possible when differently-coloured threads are added to\r\nthe mode of interlacing.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the contrast in the general appearance of a weaving\r\nshed in which all the looms are driven by belts from overhead\r\nshafting as in Fig. 35, and in a similar shed in which all the looms\r\nare individually driven by small motors made by the English Electric\r\nCo., Ltd. we introduce Fig. 36. This particular illustration shows\r\ncotton weaving shed, but precisely the same principle of driving is\r\nbeing adopted in many jute factories.\r\n\r\nA great variety of carpet patterns of a similar nature to that\r\nillustrated at C, Fig. 32, can be woven in looms such as those\r\nillustrated in Fig. 35; indeed, far more elaborate patterns than\r\nthat mentioned and illustrated are capable of being produced in\r\nthese comparatively simple looms. When, however, more than 4 leaves\r\nare required for the weaving of a pattern, a dobby loom, of the\r\nnature of that shown in Fig. 37, is employed; this machine is made\r\nby Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co., Ltd., Dundee. The dobby itself,\r\nor the apparatus which lifts the leaves according to the\r\nrequirements of the design, is fixed on the upper part of the\r\nframe-work, and is designed to control 12 leaves, that is, it\r\noperates 12 leaves, each of which lifts differently from the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.\r\nFIG. 37 DOBBY LOOM]\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of Wilton and Brussels carpets is made from\r\njute yarns, and Fig. 38 illustrates a loom at work on this\r\nparticular branch of the trade. The different colours of warp for\r\nforming the pattern me from small bobbins in the five frames at the\r\nback of the loom (hence the term 5-frame Brussels or Wilton carpet)\r\nand the ends passed through \"mail eyes\" and then through the reed.\r\nThe design is cut on the three sets of cards suspended in the\r\ncradles in the front of the loom, and these cards operate on the\r\nneedles of the jacquard machine to raise those colours of yarn which\r\ne necessary to produce the colour effect in the cloth t correspond\r\nwith the colour effect on the design paper made by the designer.\r\nThis machine weaves the actual Brussels and Wilton fabrics, and\r\nthese cloths are quite different from that illustrated at _P_, Fig.\r\n32. In both fabrics, however, ground or foundation warps are\r\nrequired. It need hardly be said that there is a considerable\r\ndifference between the two types of cloth, as well as between the\r\ndesigns and the looms in which they are woven.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For structure of carpets, _see_ pp. 394-114, _Textile\r\nDesign: Pure and Applied_, by T. Woodhouse and T. Milne.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38 BRUSSELS CARPET JACQUARD LOOM]\r\n\r\nIn the weaving department there are heavy warp beams to be placed in\r\nthe looms, and in the finishing department there are often heavy\r\nrolls of cloth to be conveyed from the machines to the despatch room.\r\nAccidents often happen when these heavy packages, especially the\r\nwarp beams, are being placed in position. In order to minimize the\r\ndanger to workpeople and to execute the work more quickly and with\r\nfewer hands, some firms have installed Overhead Runway Systems, with\r\nsuitable Lifting Gear, by means of which the warp beams are run from\r\nthe dressing and drawing-in departments direct to the looms, and\r\nthen lowered quickly and safely into the bearings. Such means of\r\ntransport are exceedingly valuable where the looms are set close to\r\neach other and where wide beams are employed; indeed, they are\r\nvaluable for all conditions, and are used for conveying cloth direct\r\nfrom the looms as well as warp beams to the looms. Fig. 39 shows the\r\nold wasteful and slow method of transferring warp beams from place\r\nto place, while Fig. 40 illustrates the modern and efficient method.\r\nThe latter figure illustrates one kind of apparatus, supplied by\r\nMessrs. Herbert Morris, Ltd., Loughborough, for this important\r\nbranch of the industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. THE OLD WAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. THE NEW WAY _By permission of Messrs.\r\nHerbert Morris, Ltd_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.  FINISHING\r\n\r\nThe finishing touches are added to the cloth after the latter leaves\r\nthe loom. The first operation is that of inspecting the cloth,\r\nremoving the lumps and other undesirables, as well as repairing any\r\ndamaged or imperfect parts. After this, the cloth is passed through\r\na cropping machine the function of which is to remove all projecting\r\nfibres from the surface of the cloth, and so impart a clean, smart\r\nappearance. It is usual to crop both sides of the cloth, although\r\nthere are some cloths which require only one side to be treated,\r\nwhile others again miss this operation entirely.\r\n\r\nA cropping machine is shown in the foreground of Fig. 41, and in\r\nthis particular case there are two fabrics being cropped or cut at\r\nthe same time; these happen to be figured fabrics which have been\r\nwoven in a jacquard loom similar to that illustrated in Fig. 38. The\r\nfabrics are, indeed, typical examples of jute Wilton carpets. The\r\nillustration shows one of the spiral croppers in the upper part of\r\nthe machine in Fig. 41. Machines are made usually with either two or\r\nfour of such spirals with their corresponding fixed blades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41 CROPPING MACHINE AT WORK]\r\n\r\nThe cloth is tensioned either by threading it over and under a\r\nseries of stout rails, or else between two in a specially adjustable\r\narrangement by means of which the tension may be varied by rotating\r\nslightly the two rails so as to alter the angle formed by the cloth\r\nin contact with them. This is, of course, at the feed side; the\r\ncloth is pulled through the machine by three rollers shown\r\ndistinctly on the right in Fig. 42. This view illustrates a double\r\ncropper in which both the spirals are controlled by one belt. As the\r\ncloth is pulled through, both sides of it are cropped by the two\r\nspirals.[3] When four spirals are required, the frame is much wider,\r\nand the second set of spirals is identical with those in the\r\nmachines illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 42 DOUBLE CROPPING MACHINE _By permission of\r\nMessrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co., Ltd_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For a full description of all finishing processes,\r\nsee _The Finishing of Jute and Linen Fabrics_, by T. Woodhouse.\r\n(Published by Messrs. Emmott & Co., Ltd., Manchester.)]\r\n\r\nThe cropped cloth is now taken to the clamping machine, and placed\r\non the floor on the left of the machine illustrated in Fig. 43,\r\nwhich represents the type made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &, Co.,\r\nDundee. The cloth is passed below a roller near to the floor, then\r\nupwards and over the middle roller, backwards to be passed under and\r\nover the roller on the left, and then forwards to the nip of the\r\npulling rollers, the bottom one of which is driven positively by\r\nmeans of a belt on the pulleys shown. While the cloth is pulled\r\nrapidly through this machine, two lines of fine jets spray water on\r\nto the two sides of the fabric to prepare it for subsequent processes\r\nin which heat is generated by the nature of the finishing process.\r\nAt other times, or rather in other machines, the water is\r\ndistributed on the two sides of the cloth by means of two rapidly\r\nrotating brushes which flick the water from two rollers rotating in\r\na tank of water at a fixed level. In both cases, both sides of the\r\nfabric are \"damped,\" as it is termed, simultaneously. The damped\r\nfabric is then allowed to lie for several hours to condition, that is,\r\nto enable the moisture to spread, and then it is taken to the\r\ncalender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co.,\r\nLtd_. FIG. 43 DAMPING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe calenders for jute almost invariably contain five different\r\nrollers, or \"bowls,\" as they are usually termed; one of these bowls,\r\nthe smallest diameter one, is often heated with steam. A five-bowl\r\ncalender is shown on the extreme right in Fig. 41, and in the\r\nbackground, while a complete illustration of a modern 5-bowl calender,\r\nwith full equipment, and made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd.,\r\nDundee, appears in Fig. 44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.\r\nFIG. 44 CALENDAR]\r\n\r\nThe cloth is placed on the floor between the two distinct parts of\r\nthe calender, threaded amongst the tension rails near the bottom\r\nroller or bowl, and then passed over two or more of the bowls\r\naccording to the type of finish desired. For calender finish, the\r\nbowls flatten the cloth by pressing out the threads and picks, so\r\nthat all the interstices which appear in most cloths as they leave\r\nthe loom, and which are exaggerated in the plan view in Fig. 34, are\r\neliminated by this calendering action. The cloth is then delivered\r\nat the far side of the machine in Fig. 44. If necessary, the surface\r\nspeed of the middle or steam-heated roller may differ from the\r\nothers so that a glazed effect--somewhat resembling that obtained by\r\nordinary ironing--is imparted to the surface of the fabric. The\r\nfaster moving roller is the steam-heated one. For ordinary calender\r\nfinish, the surface speed of all the rollers is the same.\r\n\r\nAnother \"finish\" obtained on the calender is known as \"chest finish\"\r\nor \"round-thread finish.\" In this case, the whole length of cloth is\r\nwound either on to the top roller, or the second top one, Fig. 44,\r\nand while there is subjected to the degree of pressure required; the\r\namount of pressure can be regulated by the number of weights and the\r\nway in which the tension belt is attached to its pulley. The two\r\nsets of weights are seen clearly on the left in Fig. 44, and these\r\nact on the long horizontal levers, usually to add pressure to the\r\ndead weight of the top roller, but occasionally, for very light\r\nfinishes, to decrease the effective weight of the top bowl. After\r\nthe cloth has been chested on one or other of the two top bowls, it\r\nis stripped from the bowl on to a light roller shown clearly with\r\nits belt pulley in Fig. 41.\r\n\r\nThere are two belt pulleys shown on the machine in Fig. 44; one is\r\ndriven by an open belt, and the other by a crossed belt. Provision\r\nis thus made for driving the calender in both directions. The\r\npulleys are driven by two friction clutches, both of which are\r\ninoperative when the set-on handle is vertical as in the figure.\r\nEither pulley may be rotated, however, by moving the handle to a\r\noblique position.\r\n\r\nThe compound leverage imparted to the bearings of the top bowl, and\r\nthe weights of the bowls themselves, result in the necessary pressure,\r\nand this pressure may be varied according to the number of small\r\nweights used. The heaviest finish on the calender, i.e. the\r\nchest-finish on the second top roller, imitates more or less the\r\n\"mangle finish.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.\r\nFIG. 45 HYDRAULIC MANGLE]\r\n\r\nA heavy hydraulic mangle with its accumulator and made by Messrs.\r\nUrquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee, is illustrated in Fig. 45.\r\nThe cloth is wound or beamed by the mechanism in the front on to\r\nwhat is termed a \"mangle pin\"; it is reality a thick iron bowl; when\r\nthe piece is beamed, it is automatically moved between two huge\r\nrollers, and hydraulic pressure applied. Four narrow pieces are\r\nshown in Fig. 45 on the pin, and between the two rollers. There are\r\nother four narrow pieces, already beamed on another pin, in the\r\nbeaming position, and there is still another pin at the delivery\r\nside with a similar number of cloths ready for being stripped. The\r\nthree pins are arranged thus o°o, and since all three are\r\nmoved simultaneously, when the mangling operation is finished, each\r\nroller or pin is moved through 120°. Thus, the stripped pin will be\r\nplaced in the beaming position, the beamed pin carried into the\r\nmangling position, and the pin with the mangled cloth taken to the\r\nstripping position.\r\n\r\nWhile the operation of mangling is proceeding, the rollers move\r\nfirst in one direction and then in the other direction, and this\r\nchange of direction is accomplished automatically by mechanism\r\nsituated between the accumulator and the helical-toothed gearing\r\nseen at the far end of the mangle. And while this mangling is taking\r\nplace, the operatives are beaming a fresh set, while the previously\r\nmangles pieces are being stripped by the plaiting-down apparatus\r\nwhich deposits the cloth in folds. This operation is also known as\r\n\"cuttling\" or \"faking.\" It will be, understood that a wide mangle,\r\nsuch as that illustrated in Fig. 45. is constructed specially for\r\ntreating wide fabrics, and narrow fabrics are mangled on it simply\r\nbecause circumstances and change of trade from time to time demand it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co.\r\nLtd_. Fig 46 FOLDING, LAPPING OR PLEATING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe high structure on the left is the accumulator, the manipulation\r\nof this and the number of wide weights which are ingeniously brought\r\ninto action to act on the plunger determine the pressure which is\r\napplied to the fabrics between the bowls or rollers.\r\n\r\nCloths both from the calender and the mangle now pass through a\r\nmeasuring machine, the clock of which records the length passed\r\nthrough. There are usually two hands and two circles of numbers on\r\nthe clock face; one hand registers the units up to 10 on one circle\r\nof numbers, while the slower-moving hand registers 10, 20, 30, up to\r\n100. The measuring roller in these machines is usually one yard in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nIf the cloth in process of being finished is for use as the backing\r\nor foundation of linoleum, it is invariably wound on to a wooden\r\ncentre as it emerges from the bowls of the calender, measured as well,\r\nand the winding-on mechanism is of a friction drive somewhat similar\r\nto that mentioned in connection with the dressing machine. Cloths\r\nfor this purpose are often made up to 600 yards in length; indeed,\r\nspecial looms, with winding appliances, have been constructed to\r\nweave cloths up to 2,000 yards in length. Special dressing machines\r\nand loom beams have to be made for the latter kind. When the\r\nlinoleum backing is finished at the calender, both cloth and centre\r\nare forwarded direct to the linoleum works. The empty centres are\r\nreturned periodically.\r\n\r\nNarrow-width cloths are often made up into a roll by means of a\r\nsimple machine termed a calenderoy, while somewhat similar cloth,\r\nand several types of cloths of much wider width, are lapped or\r\nfolded by special machines such as that illustrated in Fig. 46. The\r\ncloth passes over the oblique board, being guided by the discs shown,\r\nto the upper part of the carrier where it passes between the two bars.\r\nAs the carrier is oscillated from side to side (it is the right hand\r\nside in the illustration) the cloth is piled neatly in folds on the\r\nconvex table. The carriers may be adjusted to move through different\r\ndistances, so that any width or length of fold, between limits, may\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nComparatively wide pieces can be folded on the above machine, but\r\nsome merchants prefer to have wide pieces doubled lengthwise, and\r\nthis is done by machines of different kinds. In all cases, however,\r\nthe operation is termed \"crisping\" in regard to jute fabrics. Thus,\r\nFig. 47, illustrates one type of machine used for this purpose, and\r\nmade by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Ca., Ltd., Dundee. The\r\nfull-width cloth on the right has obviously two prominent\r\nstripes--one near each side. The full width cloth passes upwards\r\nobliquely a triangular board, and when the cloth reaches the apex it\r\nis doubled and passed between two bars also set obliquely on the left.\r\nThe doubled piece now passes between a pair of positively driven\r\ndrawing rollers, and is then \"faked,\" \"cuttled,\" or pleated as\r\nindicated. The machine thus automatically, doubles the piece, and\r\ndelivers it as exemplified in folds of half width. In other\r\nindustries, this operation is termed creasing and, rigging.  Some of\r\nthe later types of crisping or creasing machines double the cloth\r\nlengthwise as illustrated in Fig. 47, and, in addition, roll it at\r\nthe same time instead of delivering it in loose folds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart Lindsay & Co. Ltd_.\r\nFIG. 47 CRISPING, CREASING OR RIGGING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nIf the cloth is intended to be cut up into lengths, say for the\r\nmaking of bags of various kinds, and millions of such bags are made\r\nannually, it is cut up into the desired lengths, either by hand,\r\nsemi-mechanically, or wholly mechanically, and then the lengths are\r\nsewn at desired places by sewing machines, and in various ways\r\naccording to requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co. Ltd_\r\nFIG 48 SEMI-MECHANICAL BAG OR SACK CUTTING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nFig. 48 illustrates one of the semi-mechanical machines for this\r\npurpose; this particular type being made by Messrs. Urquhart,\r\nLindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee. About eight or nine different cloths\r\nare arranged in frames behind the cutting machine, and the ends of\r\nthese cloths passed between the horizontal bars at the back of the\r\nmachine. They are then led between the rollers, under the cutting\r\nknife, and on to the table. The length of cloth is measured as it\r\npasses between the rollers, and different change pinions are\r\nsupplied so that practically any length may be cut. Eight or nine\r\nlengths are thus passed under the knife frame simultaneously, and\r\nwhen the required length has been delivered, the operative inserts\r\nthe knife in the slot of the knife frame, and pushes it forward by\r\nmeans of the long handle shown distinctly above the frame and table.\r\nHe thus cuts eight or nine at a time, after which a further length\r\nis drawn forward, and the cycle repeated. Means are provided for\r\nregistering the number passed through; from 36,000 yards to 40,000\r\nyards can be treated per day.\r\n\r\nThe bags may be made of different materials, e.g. the first four in\r\nFig. 32. When hessian cloth, II, Fig. 32, is used, the sewing is\r\nusually done by quick-running small machines, such as the Yankee or\r\nUnion; each of these machines is capable of sewing more than 2,000\r\nbags per day. For the heavier types of cloth, such as sacking,\r\n_S_, Fig. 32, the sewing is almost invariably done by the Laing or\r\noverhead sewing machine, the general type of which is illustrated in\r\nFig. 49, and made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald, South St. Roque's Works,\r\nDundee. This is an absolutely fast stitch, and approximately 1,000\r\nbags can be sewn in one day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49 OVERHEAD (LAING) SACK SEWING MACHINE _By\r\npermission of Mr. D. J. Macdonald_]\r\n\r\nThe distinctive marks in bags for identification often take the form\r\nof coloured stripes woven in the cloth, and as illustrated at\r\n_S_, Fig. 32. It is obvious that a considerable variety can be\r\nmade by altering the number of the stripes, their position, and\r\ntheir width, while if different coloured threads appear in the same\r\ncloth, the variety is still further increased.\r\n\r\nMany firms, however, prefer to have their names, trade marks, and\r\nother distinctive features printed on the bags; in these cases, the\r\nnecessary particulars are printed on the otherwise completed bag by\r\na sack-printing machine of the flat-bed or circular roller type. The\r\nlatter type, which is most largely used, is illustrated in Fig. 50.\r\nIt is termed a two-colour machine, and is made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald,\r\nDundee; it will be observed that there are two rollers for the two\r\ndistinct colours, say red and black. Occasionally three and\r\nfour-colour machines are used, but the one-colour type is probably\r\nthe most common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By Permission of Mr. D. J. Macdonald_. FIG 50 SACK\r\nPRINTING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the bags can thus be shown distinctly by one of the\r\nmany methods of colour printing, and if any firm desires to number\r\ntheir bags consecutively in order to provide a record of their stock,\r\nor for any other purpose, the bags may be so numbered by means of a\r\nspecial numbering machine, also made by Mr. D. J. Macdonald.\r\n\r\nThe last operation, excluding the actual delivery of the goods, is\r\nthat of packing the pieces or bags in small compass by means of a\r\nhydraulic press. The goods are placed on the lower moving table upon\r\na suitable wrapping of some kind of jute cloth; when the requisite\r\nquantity has been placed thereon, the top and side wrappers are\r\nplaced in position, and the pumps started in order to raise the\r\nbottom table and to squeeze the content between it and the top fixed\r\ntable. From 1 1/2 ton to 2 tons per square inch is applied\r\naccording to the nature of the goods and their destination. While\r\nthe goods are thus held securely in position between the two plates,\r\nthe wrappers a sewn together. Then specially prepared hoops or metal\r\nbands are placed round the bale, and an ingenious and simple system,\r\ninvolving a buckle and two pins, adopted for fastening the bale. The\r\nends of the hoop or band are bent in a small press, and these bent\r\nends are passed through a rectangular hole in the buckle and the\r\npins inserted in the loops. As soon as the hydraulic pressure is\r\nremoved, the bale expands slightly, and the buckled hoop grips the\r\nbale securely.\r\n\r\nSuch is in brief the routine followed in the production of the fibre,\r\nthe transformation of this fibre, first into yarn, and then into\r\ncloth, and the use of the latter in performing the function of the\r\nworld's common carrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nACCUMULATOR\r\nAssorting jute fibre.\r\n\r\nBAG-MAKING\r\nBale opener\r\n     opening\r\nBaling cloth\r\n     house\r\n     press\r\n     station\r\nBast layer (see also Fibrous layer)\r\nBatch\r\nBatchers\r\nBatching\r\n     apparatus\r\n     carts or stalls\r\nBatch-ticket\r\nBeamer's lease\r\nBeaming\r\n     (dry) direct from bank,\r\nBlending\r\nBobbin winding\r\nBojah\r\nBotanical features of jute plants\r\nBreaker card\r\nBrussels carpet\r\nBundle of jute.\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA, jute machinery introduced into\r\nCalender\r\n     finish\r\nCalenderoy\r\nCarding\r\nCard waste\r\nCargoes of jute\r\nChest finish\r\nClasp-rods\r\nConditioning fibre\r\nCops\r\nCop winding\r\nCorchorus capsularis\r\n     clitorius\r\nCrisping and crisping machines\r\nCropping machine\r\nCultivation of jute\r\nCutting knife for jute fibre\r\nCuttings.\r\n\r\nDAMPING machine\r\nDefects in fibre and in handling\r\nDesigns or weaves\r\nDifferential motion\r\nDobby loom\r\nDraft\r\nDrafting\r\nDrawing\r\n  frames\r\n    different kinds of\r\nDrawing-in\r\nDressing and dressing machine\r\nDrum\r\nDrying jute fibre\r\nDust shaker.\r\n\r\nEAST India Co.\r\nExports of jute from India.\r\n\r\nFABRICS\r\nFaller\r\nFarming operations\r\nFibres,\r\n  the five main\r\n    imports of jute.\r\n\r\n\r\nFibrous layer\r\nFinisher card\r\nFinishing\r\nfolding machine.\r\n\r\nGaiting\r\nGlazed finish\r\nGrading jute fibre\r\nGunny bags.\r\n\r\nHand batching\r\nHarvesting the plants\r\nHeight of jute plants\r\nHydraulic mangle\r\n  press.\r\n\r\nIdentification marks on bags\r\nImports of jute.\r\n\r\nJacquard loom\r\nJute crop\r\n  exports from India\r\n  fabrics\r\n  fibre, imports of\r\n  industry\r\n  knife\r\n  plants, botanical and physical features of\r\n  cultivation of\r\n  height of\r\n  marks.\r\n\r\nLaddering\r\nLadders\r\nLapping machine\r\nLinking machine\r\nLinoleum\r\nLooms\r\nLubrication of fibre.\r\n\r\nMachine batching\r\nMachinery for jute manufacture introduced into Calcutta\r\nMangle finish\r\n  (hydraulic)\r\nMarks of jute (_see_ jute marks)\r\nMaund\r\nMeasuring and marking machine\r\n  machine for cloth\r\n  the warp\r\nMethods of preparing warps\r\nMultiple-colour printing machines.\r\n\r\nNumbering machine for bags.\r\n\r\nOpening jute heads\r\nOverhead runway systems\r\n  sewing machine (Laing's).\r\n\r\nPacking goods\r\nPhysical features of jute plants\r\nPin-lease\r\nPlaiting machine\r\nPlants, thinning of\r\n  weeding of\r\nPloughs for jute cultivation\r\nPoint-paper designs\r\nPorcupine feed\r\nPrinting machine.\r\n\r\nReach\r\nReeling\r\nRetting\r\nRoller-feed\r\nRolls\r\nRoot-comber\r\n  opener\r\nRound-thread finish\r\nRove\r\nRoving frame\r\nRoxburgh, Dr.\r\n\r\nSack-cutting frame, semi-mechanical\r\nSack making\r\n  printing machine\r\nSand bags\r\nSeed\r\n  per acre, amount of\r\n  sowing of\r\nSewing machines\r\nShell-feed\r\nShort-tell\r\nSnipping machine\r\nSoftening machines\r\nSpinning\r\nSpool or roll winding\r\nSpools (_see_ Rolls)\r\nStandard bale\r\nStarching (_see_ Dressing)\r\nSteeping (_see_ Retting)\r\nStriker-up (_see_ Batcher)\r\nStripping\r\nSystems.\r\n\r\nTeazer\r\nTell (of yarn)\r\nThinning of plants\r\nThrum\r\nTime for harvesting the plants\r\nTube-twisters\r\nTwist\r\nTwisting\r\nTwo-colour printing machine\r\nTying-on\r\nTypical jute fabrics.\r\n\r\nUnion Or Yankee sewing machine\r\nUnloading bales of jute from ship.\r\n\r\nVariations in jute\r\nVarieties of jute fibre\r\n  plants.\r\n\r\nWarp\r\nWarp dressing (_see_ Dressing)\r\nWarping, beaming and dressing\r\n  mill\r\nWashing\r\nWaste\r\n  teazer\r\nWeaves or designs\r\nWeaving\r\nWeaver's lease\r\nWeeding of plants\r\nWeft\r\n  winding\r\nWilton carpet\r\nWinding (bobbin) machine\r\n  from hank\r\n  (large roll) machine\r\n  (ordinary size from hanks) machine\r\n  rolls and cops\r\nWorld's great war.\r\n\r\nYankee or Union sewing machine\r\nYarn table\r\nYield of fibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd., Bath, England_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Advertisement 14: Thomas Hart, LTD.; DAVID KEAY & LESLIE]\r\n\r\n[Advertisement 15: ROYLES LIMITED.]\r\n\r\n[Advertisement 16: D.
