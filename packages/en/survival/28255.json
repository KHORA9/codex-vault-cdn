C. BEARD\r\n\r\n\r\n  With Illustrations by the Author\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n  Charles Scribner's Sons\r\n  1916\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1914, BY\r\n  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS\r\n\r\n  Published September, 1914\r\n\r\n  DEDICATED TO\r\n  DANIEL BARTLETT BEARD\r\n  BECAUSE OF HIS\r\n  LOVE OF THE BIG OUTDOORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this book is written for boys of all ages, it has been divided under\r\ntwo general heads, \"The Tomahawk Camps\" and \"The Axe Camps,\" that is,\r\ncamps which may be built with no tool but a hatchet, and camps that will\r\nneed the aid of an axe.\r\n\r\nThe smallest boys can build some of the simple shelters and the older boys\r\ncan build the more difficult ones. The reader may, if he likes, begin with\r\nthe first of the book, build his way through it, and graduate by building\r\nthe log houses; in doing this he will be closely following the history of\r\nthe human race, because ever since our arboreal ancestors with prehensile\r\ntoes scampered among the branches of the pre-glacial forests and built\r\nnestlike shelters in the trees, men have made themselves shacks for a\r\ntemporary refuge. But as one of the members of the Camp-Fire Club of\r\nAmerica, as one of the founders of the Boy Scouts of America, and as the\r\nfounder of the Boy Pioneers of America, it would not be proper for the\r\nauthor to admit for one moment that there can be such a thing as a camp\r\nwithout a _camp-fire_, and for that reason the tree folks and the \"missing\r\nlink\" whose remains were found in Java, and to whom the scientists gave\r\nthe awe-inspiring name of Pithecanthropus erectus, cannot be counted as\r\ncampers, because _they did not know how to build a camp-fire_; neither can\r\nwe admit the ancient maker of stone implements, called eoliths, to be one\r\nof us, because he, too, knew not the joys of a camp-fire. But there was\r\nanother fellow, called the Neanderthal man, who lived in the ice age in\r\nEurope and he _had_ to be a camp-fire man or freeze! As far as we know, he\r\nwas the first man to build a camp-fire. The cold weather made him hustle,\r\nand hustling developed him. True, he did cook and eat his neighbors once\r\nin a while, and even split their bones for the marrow; but we will forget\r\nthat part and just remember him as the first camper in Europe.\r\n\r\nRecently a pygmy skeleton was discovered near Los Angeles which is claimed\r\nto be about twenty thousand years old, but we do not know whether this man\r\nknew how to build a fire or not. We do know, however, that the American\r\ncamper was here on this continent when our Bible was yet an unfinished\r\nmanuscript and that he was building his fires, toasting his venison, and\r\nbuilding \"sheds\" when the red-headed Eric settled in Greenland, when\r\nThorwald fought with the \"Skraelings,\" and Biarni's dragon ship made the\r\ntrip down the coast of Vineland about the dawn of the Christian era. We\r\nalso know that the American camper was here when Columbus with his comical\r\ntoy ships was blundering around the West Indies. We also know that the\r\nAmerican camper watched Henry Hudson steer the _Half Moon_ around\r\nManhattan Island. It is this same American camper who has taught us to\r\nbuild many of the shacks to be found in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe shacks, sheds, shanties, and shelters described in the following pages\r\nare, all of them, similar to those used by the people on this continent or\r\nsuggested by the ones in use and are typically American; and the designs\r\nare suited to the arctics, the tropics, and temperate climes; also to the\r\nplains, the mountains, the desert, the bog, and even the water.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be natural and proper to follow the camp as it grows until it\r\ndevelops into a somewhat pretentious log house, but this book must not be\r\nconsidered as competing in any manner with professional architects. The\r\nbuildings here suggested require a woodsman more than an architect; the\r\nwork demands more the skill of the axeman than that of the carpenter and\r\njoiner. The log houses are supposed to be buildings which any real outdoor\r\nman should be able to erect by himself and for himself. Many of the\r\nbuildings have already been built in many parts of the country by Boy\r\nPioneers and Boy Scouts.\r\n\r\nThis book is not intended as an encyclopedia or history of primitive\r\narchitecture; the bureaus at Washington, and the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, are better equipped for that purpose than the author.\r\n\r\nThe boys will undoubtedly acquire a dexterity and skill in building the\r\nshacks and shanties here described, which will be of lasting benefit to\r\nthem whether they acquire the skill by building camps \"just for the fun of\r\nthe thing\" or in building them for the more practical purpose of\r\nfurnishing shelter for overnight pleasure hikes, for the wilderness\r\ntrail, or for permanent camps while living in the open.\r\n\r\nIt has been the writer's experience that the readers depend more upon his\r\ndiagrams than they do upon the written matter in his books, and so in this\r\nbook he has again attempted to make the diagrams self-explanatory. The\r\nbook was written in answer to requests by many people interested in the\r\nBoy Scout movement and others interested in the general activities of\r\nboys, and also in answer to the personal demands of hundreds of boys and\r\nmany men.\r\n\r\nThe drawings are all original and many of them invented by the author\r\nhimself and published here for the first time, for the purpose of\r\nsupplying all the boy readers, the Boy Scouts, and other older \"boys,\"\r\ncalling themselves Scoutmasters and sportsmen, with practical hints,\r\ndrawings, and descriptions showing how to build suitable shelters for\r\ntemporary or permanent camps.\r\n\r\n                                 DANIEL CARTER BEARD.\r\n  FLUSHING, LONG ISLAND,\r\n      APRIL 1, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n           FOREWORD                                   v\r\n\r\n        I.

HOW TO PICK AND USE ITS FEATHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT may be necessary for me to remind the boys that they must use the\r\nmaterial at hand in building their shacks, shelters, sheds, and shanties,\r\nand that they are very fortunate if their camp is located in a country\r\nwhere the mountain goose is to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Goose\r\n\r\nFrom Labrador down to the northwestern borders of New England and New York\r\nand from thence to southwestern Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee,\r\nthe woodsman and camper may make their beds from the feathers of the\r\n\"mountain goose.\" The mountain goose is also found inhabiting the frozen\r\nsoil of Alaska and following the Pacific and the Rocky Mountains the Abies\r\nmake their dwelling-place as far south as Guatemala. Consequently, the\r\nAbies, or mountain goose, should be a familiar friend of all the scouts\r\nwho live in the mountainous country, north, south, east, and west.\r\n\r\n\r\nSapin--Cho-kho-tung\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that the mountain goose (Figs. 1 and 2) is not a bird but\r\na tree. It is humorously called a goose by the woodsmen because they all\r\nmake their beds of its \"feathers.\" It is the _sapin_ of the\r\nFrench-Canadians, the _cho-kho-tung_ of the New York Indians, the balsam\r\nof the tenderfoot, the Christmas-tree of the little folk, and that\r\nparticular Coniferæ known by the dry-as-dust botanist as Abies. There is\r\nnothing in nature which has a wilder, more sylvan and charming perfume\r\nthan the balsam, and the scout who has not slept in the woods on a balsam\r\nbed has a pleasure in store for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalsam\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the balsam are blunt or rounded at the ends and some of them\r\nare even dented or notched in place of being sharp-pointed. Each spine or\r\nleaf is a scant one inch in length and very flat; the upper part is\r\ngrooved and of a dark bluish-green color. The under-side is much lighter,\r\noften almost silvery white. The balsam blossoms in April or May, and the\r\nfruit or cones stand upright on the branches. These vary from two to four\r\ninches in length. The balsam-trees are seldom large, not many of them\r\nbeing over sixty feet high with trunks from one to less than three feet\r\nthrough. The bark on the trunks is gray in color and marked with\r\nhorizontal rows of blisters. Each of these contains a small, sticky sap\r\nlike glycerine. Fig. 1 shows the cone and leaves of one of the Southern\r\nbalsams known as the she-balsam, and Fig. 2 shows the celebrated\r\nbalsam-fir tree of the north country, cone and branch.\r\n\r\nFig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5. Fig. 6. Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing the use of the mountain goose.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBalsam Beds\r\n\r\nThe balsam bed is made of the small twigs of balsam-trees. In gathering\r\nthese, collect twigs of different lengths, from eighteen inches long (to\r\nbe used as the foundation of the bed) to ten or twelve inches long (for\r\nthe top layer). If you want to rest well, do not economize on the amount\r\nyou gather; many a time I have had my bones ache as a result of being too\r\ntired to make my bed properly and attempting to sleep on a thin layer of\r\nboughs.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to chop off the boughs of balsam they will resent your\r\neffort by springing back and slapping you in the face. You can cut them\r\nwith your knife, but it is slow work and will blister your hands. Take\r\ntwig by twig with the thumb and fingers (the thumb on top, pointing toward\r\nthe tip of the bough, and the two forefingers underneath); press down with\r\nthe thumb, and with a twist of the wrist you can snap the twigs like\r\npipe-stems. Fig. 3 shows two views of the hands in a proper position to\r\nsnap off twigs easily and clean. The one at the left shows the hand as it\r\nwould appear looking down upon it; the one at the right shows the view as\r\nyou look at it from the side.\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking Boughs\r\n\r\nAfter collecting a handful of boughs, string them on a stick which you\r\nhave previously prepared (Fig. 4). This stick should be of strong, green\r\nhardwood, four or five feet long with a fork about six inches long left on\r\nit at the butt end to keep the boughs from sliding off, and sharpened at\r\nthe upper end so that it can be easily poked through a handful of boughs.\r\nString the boughs on this stick as you would string fish, but do it one\r\nhandful at a time, allowing the butts to point in different directions.\r\nIt is astonishing to see the amount of boughs you can carry when strung on\r\na stick in this manner and thrown over your shoulder as in Fig. 5. If you\r\nhave a lash rope, place the boughs on a loop of the rope, as in Fig. 6,\r\nthen bring the two ends of the rope up through the loop and sling the\r\nbundle on your back.\r\n\r\n\r\nClean Your Hands\r\n\r\nWhen you have finished gathering the material for your bed your hands will\r\nbe covered with a sticky sap, and, although they will be a sorry sight, a\r\nlittle lard or baking grease will soften the pitchy substance so that it\r\nmay be washed off with soap and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Make Beds\r\n\r\nTo make your bed, spread a layer of the larger boughs on the ground;\r\ncommence at the head and shingle them down to the foot so that the tips\r\npoint toward the head of the bed, overlapping the butts (Fig. 7). Continue\r\nthis until your mattress is thick enough to make a soft couch upon which\r\nyou can sleep as comfortably as you do at home. Cover the couch with one\r\nblanket and use the bag containing your coat, extra clothes, and sweater\r\nfor a pillow. Then if you do not sleep well, you must blame the cook.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bedding\r\n\r\nIf you should happen to be camping in a country destitute of balsam,\r\nhemlock, or pine, you can make a good spring mattress by collecting small\r\ngreen branches of any sort of tree which is springy and elastic. Build the\r\nmattress as already described. On top of this put a thick layer of hay,\r\nstraw, or dry leaves or even green material, provided you have a rubber\r\nblanket or poncho to cover the latter. In Kentucky I have made a mattress\r\nof this description and covered the branches with a thick layer of the\r\npurple blossoms of ironweed; over this I spread a rubber army blanket to\r\nkeep out the moisture from the green stuff and on top of this made my bed\r\nwith my other blankets. It was as comfortable a couch as I have ever slept\r\non; in fact, it was literally a bed of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE HALF-CAVE SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first object of a roof of any kind is protection against the weather;\r\nno shelter is necessary in fair weather unless the sun in the day or the\r\ndampness or coolness of the night cause discomfort. In parts of the West\r\nthere is so little rain that a tent is often an unnecessary burden, but in\r\nthe East and the other parts of the country some sort of shelter is\r\nnecessary for health and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe original American was always quick to see the advantages offered by an\r\noverhanging cliff for a camp site (Figs. 9, 10). His simple camps all\r\nthrough the arid Southwest had gradually turned into carefully built\r\nhouses long before we came here. The overhanging cliffs protected the\r\nbuildings from the rain and weather, and the site was easily defended from\r\nenemies. But while these cliff-dwellings had reached the dignity of\r\ncastles in the Southwest, in the Eastern States--Pennsylvania, for\r\ninstance--the Iroquois Indians were making primitive camps and using every\r\navailable overhanging cliff for that purpose.\r\n\r\nTo-day any one may use a pointed stick on the floor of one of these half\r\ncaves and unearth, as I have done, numerous potsherds, mussel shells, bone\r\nawls, flint arrow-heads, split bones of large game animals, and the burnt\r\nwood of centuries of camp-fires which tell the tale of the first lean-to\r\nshelter used by camping man in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf Caves\r\n\r\nThe projecting ledges of bluestone that have horizontal seams form half\r\ncaves from the falling apart of the lower layers of the cliff caused by\r\nrain and ice and often aided by the fine roots of the black birch, rock\r\noak, and other plants, until nature has worked long enough as a quarry-man\r\nand produced half caves large enough to shelter a stooping man (Figs. 8,\r\n9, and 10).\r\n\r\nAlthough not always necessary, it is sometimes best to make a shelter for\r\nthe open face of such a cave, even if we only need it for a temporary camp\r\n(Fig. 10); this may be done by resting poles slanting against the face of\r\nthe cliff and over these making a covering of balsam, pine, hemlock,\r\npalmetto, palm branches, or any available material for thatch to shed the\r\nrain and prevent it driving under the cliff to wet our bedding.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalls\r\n\r\nIt is not always necessary to thatch the wall; a number of green boughs\r\nwith leaves adhering may be rested against the cliffs and will answer for\r\nthat purpose. Set the boughs upside down so that they will shed the rain\r\nand not hold it so as to drip into camp. Use your common sense and\r\ngumption, which will teach you that all the boughs should point downward\r\nand not upward as most of them naturally grow. I am careful to call your\r\nattention to this because I lately saw some men teaching Boy Scouts how to\r\nmake camps and they were placing the boughs for the lads around the\r\nshelter with their branches pointing upward in such a manner that they\r\ncould not shed the rain. These instructors were city men and apparently\r\nthought that the boughs were for no other purpose than to give privacy to\r\nthe occupants of the shelter, forgetting that in the wilds the wilderness\r\nitself furnishes privacy.\r\n\r\nFig. 8.

Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The half-cave shelter.]\r\n\r\nThe half cave was probably the first lean-to or shelter in this country,\r\nbut overhanging cliffs are not always found where we wish to make our camp\r\nand we must resort to other forms of shelter and the use of other material\r\nin such localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE THE FALLEN-TREE SHELTER AND THE SCOUT-MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW that you know how to make a bed in a half cave, we will take up the\r\nmost simple and primitive manufactured shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFallen-Tree Shelter\r\n\r\nFor a one-man one-night stand, select a thick-foliaged fir-tree and cut it\r\npartly through the trunk so that it will fall as shown in Fig. 11; then\r\ntrim off the branches on the under-side so as to leave room to make your\r\nbed beneath the branches; next trim the branches off the top or roof of\r\nthe trunk and with them thatch the roof. Do this by setting the branches\r\nwith their butts up as shown in the right-hand shelter of Fig. 13, and\r\nthen thatch with smaller browse as described in making the bed. This will\r\nmake a cosey one-night shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scout-Master\r\n\r\nOr take three forked sticks (_A_, _B_, and _C_, Fig. 12), and interlock\r\nthe forked ends so that they will stand as shown in Fig. 12. Over this\r\nframework rest branches with the butt ends up as shown in the right-hand\r\nshelter (Fig. 13), or lay a number of poles as shown in the left-hand\r\nfigure (Fig. 12) and thatch this with browse as illustrated by the\r\nleft-hand shelter in Fig. 13, or take elm, spruce, or birch bark and\r\nshingle as in Fig. 14. These shelters may be built for one boy or they may\r\nbe made large enough for several men. They may be thatched with balsam,\r\nspruce, pine, or hemlock boughs, or with cat-tails, rushes (see Figs. 66\r\nand 69) or any kind of long-stemmed weeds or palmetto leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Peel Bark\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I trust that the reader has enough common sense and\r\nsufficient love of the woods to prevent him from killing or marring and\r\ndisfiguring trees where trees are not plenty, and this restriction\r\nincludes all settled or partially settled parts of the country. But in the\r\nreal forests and wilderness, miles and miles away from human habitation,\r\nthere are few campers and consequently there will be fewer trees injured,\r\nand these few will not be missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelecting Bark\r\n\r\nTo get the birch bark, select a tree with a smooth trunk devoid of\r\nbranches and, placing skids for the trunk to fall upon (Fig. 38), fell the\r\ntree (see Figs. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, and 118), and then cut a\r\ncircle around the trunk at the two ends of the log and a slit from one\r\ncircle clean up to the other circle (Fig. 38); next, with a sharp stick\r\nshaped like a blunt-edged chisel, pry off the bark carefully until you\r\ntake the piece off in one whole section. If it is spruce bark or any other\r\nbark you seek, hunt through the woods for a comparatively smooth trunk and\r\nproceed in the same manner as with the birch. To take it off a standing\r\ntree, cut one circle down at the butt and another as high as you can reach\r\n(Fig. 118) and slit it along a perpendicular line connecting the two cuts\r\nas in Fig. 38. This will doubtless in time kill the tree, but far from\r\nhuman habitations the few trees killed in this manner may do the forest\r\ngood by giving more room for others to grow. Near town or where the\r\nforests are small use the bark from the old dead trees.\r\n\r\nFig. 11. Fig. 12. Fig. 13. Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One-night shelter. The fallen tree and the scout-master.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Bark\r\n\r\nTo shingle with bark, cut the bark in convenient sections, commence at the\r\nbottom, place one piece of bark set on edge flat against the wall of your\r\nshelter, place a piece of bark next to it in the same manner, allowing the\r\none edge to overlap the first piece a few inches, and so on all the way\r\naround your shack; then place a layer of bark above this in the same\r\nmanner as the first one, the end edges overlapping, the bottom edges also\r\noverlapping the first row three or four inches or even more. Hold these\r\npieces of bark in place by stakes driven in the ground against them or\r\npoles laid over them, according to the shape or form of your shelter.\r\nContinue thus to the comb of the roof, then over the part where the bark\r\nof the sides meets on the top lay another layer of bark covering the\r\ncrown, ridge, comb, or apex and protecting it from the rain. In the\r\nwigwam-shaped shelters, or rather I should say those of teepee form, the\r\npoint of the cone or pyramid is left open to serve as chimney for smoke to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE THE ADIRONDACK, THE WICK-UP, THE BARK TEEPEE, THE PIONEER, AND\r\nTHE SCOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adirondack\r\n\r\nTHE next shelter is what is generally known as the Adirondack shelter,\r\nwhich is a lean-to open in the front like a \"Baker\" or a \"Dan Beard\" tent.\r\nAlthough it is popularly called the Adirondack camp, it antedates the time\r\nwhen the Adirondacks were first used as a fashionable resort. Daniel Boone\r\nwas wont to make such a camp in the forests of Kentucky. The lean-to or\r\nAdirondack camp is easily made and very popular. Sometimes two of them are\r\nbuilt facing each other with an open space between for the camp-fire. But\r\nthe usual manner is to set up two uprights as in Fig. 15, then lay a\r\ncrosspiece through the crotches and rest poles against this crosspiece\r\n(Fig. 16). Over these poles other poles are laid horizontally and the roof\r\nthatched with browse by the method shown by Fig. 6, but here the tips of\r\nthe browse must point down and be held in place by other poles (Fig. 10)\r\non top of it. Sometimes a log is put at the bottom of the slanting poles\r\nand sometimes more logs are placed as shown in Figs. 15 and 16 and the\r\nspace between them floored with balsam or browse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scout\r\n\r\nWhere birch bark is obtainable it is shingled with slabs of this bark as\r\nalready described, and as shown in Fig. 17, the bark being held in place\r\non the roof by poles laid over it and on the side by stakes being driven\r\nin the ground outside of the bark to hold it in place as in Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nFig. 15. Fig. 16. Fig. 17. Fig. 18. Fig. 19. Fig. 20. Fig. 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Adirondack. The scout, the pioneer, and the bark\r\nteepee.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer\r\n\r\nFig. 18 shows the Pioneer, a tent form of shack, and Fig. 19 shows how the\r\nbark is placed like shingles overlapping each other so as to shed the\r\nrain. The doorway of the tent shack is made by leaning poles against\r\nforked sticks, their butts forming a semicircle in front, or rather the\r\narc of a circle, and by bracing them against the forked stick fore and aft\r\nthey add stability to the structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBark Teepee\r\n\r\nOr you may, if you choose, lash three sticks together at the top ends,\r\nspread them in the form of a tripod, then lay other sticks against them,\r\ntheir butts forming a circle in the form of a teepee (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nCommence at the bottom as you do in shingling a roof and place sections of\r\nbirch bark around, others above them overlapping them, and hold them in\r\nplace by resting poles against them. If your camp is to be occupied for a\r\nweek or so, it may be convenient to build a wick-up shelter as a\r\ndining-room like the one shown in Fig. 21. This is made with six uprights,\r\ntwo to hold the ridge-pole and two to hold the eaves, and may be shingled\r\nover with browse or birch, elm, spruce, or other bark; shingle with the\r\nbrowse in the same manner as that described for the bark, beginning at the\r\neaves and allowing each row of browse to overlap the butts of the one\r\nbelow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE BEAVER-MAT HUTS OR FAGOT SHACKS WITHOUT INJURY TO THE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterial\r\n\r\nIN building a shelter use every and any thing handy for the purpose;\r\nofttimes an uprooted tree will furnish a well-made adobe wall, where the\r\nspreading roots have torn off the surface soil as the tree fell and what\r\nwas the under-side is now an exposed wall of clay, against which you may\r\nrest the poles for the roof of a lean-to. Or the side of the cliff (Fig.\r\n23) may offer you the same opportunity. Maybe two or three trees will be\r\nfound willing to act as uprights (Fig. 24). Where you use a wall of any\r\nkind, rock, roots, or bank, it will, of course, be necessary to have your\r\ndoorway at one side of the shack as in Fig. 23. The upright poles may be\r\non stony ground where their butts cannot well be planted in the earth, and\r\nthere it will be necessary to brace them with slanting poles (Fig. 25).\r\nEach camp will offer problems of its own, problems which add much to the\r\ninterest and pleasure of camp making.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaver Mat\r\n\r\nThe beaver-mat camp is a new one and, under favorable conditions, a good\r\none. Cut your poles the length required for the framework of the sides,\r\nlash them together with the green rootlets of the tamarack or strips of\r\nbark of the papaw, elm, cedar, or the inside bark of the chestnut (_A_,\r\nFig. 22); then make a bed of browse of any kind handy, but make it in the\r\nmanner described for making balsam beds (Fig. 7). You will, of course,\r\nthatch so that when the side is erected it is shingled like a house, the\r\nupper rows overlapping the lower ones. Then lash a duplicate frame over\r\nthe browse-padded frame and the side is complete (_B_, Fig. 22). Make the\r\nother side or sides and the roof (_C_, Fig. 22) in the same manner, after\r\nwhich it is a simple matter to erect your shack (Fig. 22, and _E_, Fig.\r\n22).\r\n\r\nFig. 22. Fig. 23. Fig. 24. Fig. 25. Fig. 26. Fig. 27. Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shelters adapted to conditions. The beaver-mat and the\r\nfagot shack.]\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of this sort of shelter is that it is much easier to\r\ndo your thatching on the ground than on standing walls, and also, when\r\ndone, it is so compact as to be practically water-proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nFagot Shack\r\n\r\nThe fagot shack is also a new style of camp and is intended for use in\r\nplaces where large timber cannot be cut, but where dwarf willows, bamboo\r\ncane, alders, or other small underbrush is more or less plentiful. From\r\nthis gather a plentiful supply of twigs and with improvised twine bind the\r\ntwigs into bundles of equal size. Use these bundles as you would stones in\r\nbuilding the wall and lay them so as to break joints, that is, so that the\r\njoints are never in a continuous line. Hold the wall in place by stakes as\r\nshown in Fig. 26. Use the browse, small twigs with the leaves adhering to\r\nthem, in place of mortar or cement so as to level your bundles and prevent\r\ntheir rocking on uneven surfaces. The doorways and window openings offer\r\nno problem that a rank outsider cannot solve. Fig. 27 shows the window\r\nopening, also shows you how the window-sill can be made firm by laying\r\nrods over the top of the fagots. Rods are also used across the top of the\r\ndoorway upon which to place the bundles of fagots or twigs. Twigs is\r\nprobably the best term to use here, as fagots might be thought to mean\r\nlarger sticks, which may be stiff and obstinate and hard to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoofs\r\n\r\nAfter the walls are erected, a beaver-mat roof may be placed upon them or\r\na roof made on a frame such as shown in Fig. 28 and thatched with small\r\nsticks over which a thatch of straw, hay, rushes (Figs. 66 and 69), or\r\nbrowse may be used to shed the rain.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage which recommends the beaver-mat and fagot camp to\r\nlovers of nature and students of forestry lies in the fact that it is\r\nunnecessary to cut down or destroy a single large or valuable young tree\r\nin order to procure the material necessary to make the camp. Both of these\r\ncamps can be made in forest lands by using the lower branches of the\r\ntrees, which, when properly cut close to the trunk (Fig. 121), do not\r\ninjure the standing timber. The fagot hut may be made into a permanent\r\ncamp by plastering the outside with soft mud or clay and treating the\r\ninside walls in the same manner, thus transforming it into an adobe\r\nshack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nINDIAN SHACKS AND SHELTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE the ingenuity of the white man may make improvements upon the\r\nwick-ups, arbors, huts, and shelters of the native red man, we must not\r\nforget that these native shelters have been used with success by the\r\nIndians for centuries, also we must not forget that our principal\r\nobjection to many of them lies in the fact that they are ill ventilated\r\nand dirty, both of which defects may be remedied without materially\r\ndeparting from the lines laid down by the savage architects. The making of\r\nwindows will supply ventilation to Indian huts, but the form of the hut we\r\nmust bear in mind is made to suit the locality in which we find it.\r\n\r\n\r\nApache Hogan\r\n\r\nThe White Mountain Apache builds a tent-shaped shack (Figs. 29 and 32)\r\nwhich is practically the same as that already described and shown in Figs.\r\n18 and 19, the difference being that the Apache shack is not covered with\r\nbirch bark, a material peculiar to the North, but the Apache uses a thatch\r\nof the rank grass to be found where his shacks are located. To-day,\r\nhowever, the White Mountain Apache has become so degenerate and so lost to\r\nthe true sense of dignity as a savage that he stoops to use corn-stalks\r\nwith which to thatch the long, sloping sides of his shed-like house but by\r\nso doing he really shows good horse sense, for corn-stalks and corn leaves\r\nmake good material for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFig. 29. Fig. 30. Fig. 31. Fig. 32. Fig. 33. Fig. 34. Fig. 34½.\r\nFig. 35.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Designs adapted from Indian models.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Carlos Shack\r\n\r\nThe San Carlos Apache Indians build a dome-shaped hut by making a\r\nframework of small saplings bent in arches as the boys did in Kentucky\r\nwhen the writer was himself a lad, and as shown in Fig. 30. The ends of\r\nthe pole are sunk into the ground in the form of a circle, while their\r\ntips are bent over and bound together thus forming a series of loops which\r\noverlap each other and give stability and support to the principal loops\r\nwhich run from the ground to the top of the dome. The Indians thatch these\r\nhuts with bear-grass arranged in overlapping rows and held in place with\r\nstrings (see Fig. 69) made of yucca leaves (Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n\r\nChippewa Shack\r\n\r\nMuch farther north I have seen the Chippewa Indians build a framework in\r\npractically the same manner as the San Carlos Apache, but the Chippewas\r\ncovered their frame with layers of birch bark held in place by ropes\r\nstretched over it as shown in Fig. 32. The door to their huts consisted of\r\na blanket portière.\r\n\r\nIn the same locality to-day it would be difficult if not impossible to\r\nprocure such large strips of birch bark; but the dome-shaped frame is a\r\ngood one to be used in many localities and, like all other frames, it can\r\nbe covered with the material at hand. It may be shingled with smaller\r\npieces of bark, covered with brush and thatched with browse or with hay,\r\nstraw, palmetto leaves, palm leaves, or rushes, or it may be plastered\r\nover with mud and made an adobe hut.\r\n\r\n\r\nPima Lodge\r\n\r\nThe Pima Indians make a flat-roofed lodge with slanting walls (Fig. 33)\r\nwhich may be adapted for our use in almost any section of the country. It\r\ncan be made warm and tight for the far North and cool and airy for the\r\narid regions of the Southwest. The framework, as you may see by referring\r\nto the diagram, is similar to the wick-ups we men made when we were boys,\r\nand which are described in the \"American Boy's Handy Book,\" consisting of\r\nfour upright posts supporting in their crotches two crosspieces over which\r\na flat roof is made by placing poles across. But the sides of this shack\r\nare not upright but made by resting leaning poles against the eaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Man's Walls\r\n\r\nThe principal difference between a white man's architecture and the\r\nIndian's lies in the fact that the white man, with brick, stone, or frame\r\nhouse in his mind, is possessed of a desire to build perpendicular\r\nwalls--walls which are hard to thatch and difficult to cover with turf,\r\nespecially in the far North, where there is no true sod such as we\r\nunderstand in the middle country, where our grass grows thickly with\r\ninterlacing roots. Boys will do well to remember this and imitate the\r\nIndian in making slanting walls for their shacks, shanties, and shelters\r\nin the woods. If they have boards or stone or brick or logs with which to\r\nbuild they may, with propriety, use a perpendicular wall. The Pima\r\nIndians, according to Pliny Earle Goddard, associate curator of\r\nanthropology of the American Museum of Natural History, thatch their\r\nhouses with arrow brush and not infrequently bank the sides of the shack\r\nwith dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdobe Roof\r\n\r\nIf you want to put a dirt roof on a shack of this description, cover the\r\npoles with small boughs or browse, green or dry leaves, straw, hay, grass,\r\nor rushes and put the sod over the top of this. If in place of making the\r\nroof flat, as shown in Fig. 33, you slant it so as to shed the rain, this\r\nsort of shack will do for almost any climate, but with a flat roof it is\r\nonly fitted for the arid country or for a shelter from the sun when it is\r\nnot expected to be used during the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNavajo\r\n\r\nThe teepee-shaped hut used by the Navajo Indians _will_ shed the rain. To\r\nbuild this shack interlock three forked sticks as shown in the diagram,\r\nthen lay other poles up against the forks of these sticks so that the\r\nbutts of the poles will form a circle on the ground (Fig. 34). Thatch this\r\nwith any material handy, after which you may cover it with dirt as the\r\nNavajos do, in which case you had better build a hallway for entrance, as\r\nshown in Fig. 35. This same teepee form is used by the California Indians\r\nand thatched with wild hay (Fig. 34½).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBIRCH BARK OR TAR PAPER SHACK\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION of the Pontiac was first published in my \"Field and Forest\r\nHandy Book,\" a book which contains several shelters similar to the ones\r\nhere given, most of which were originally made for Caspar Whitney while he\r\nwas editor of _Outing_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pontiac\r\n\r\nThe Pontiac, as here given, is my own design and invention (Fig. 36). It\r\nis supposed to be shingled with birch bark, but, as is the case with all\r\nthese camps, other bark may be substituted for the birch, and, if no bark\r\nis within reach and you are near enough to civilization, tar paper makes\r\nan excellent substitute. Fig. 37 shows the framework of a Pontiac with a\r\nridge-pole, but the ridge-pole is not necessary and the shack may be built\r\nwithout it, as shown in Figs. 36 and 39, where the rafter poles rest upon\r\nthe two side-plates over which they project to form the apex of the roof.\r\nIn Fig. 39, although the side-plates are drawn, the rafter or roof poles\r\nare not because the diagram is supposed to be a sort of X-ray affair to\r\nshow the internal construction. The opening for smoke need not be more\r\nthan half as large as it is in Fig. 39 and it may be covered up in\r\ninclement weather with a piece of bark so as to keep out the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Bark\r\n\r\nFig. 38 shows a tree felled in order to procure bark. You will note that\r\nthe bark is cut round at the bottom and at the top and a slit is made\r\nconnecting the two cuts as already described so that the bark may be\r\npeeled off by running a blunt instrument or a stick, whittled to the shape\r\nof a paper-cutter or dull chisel, under the edge of the bark and carefully\r\npeeling it back. If it is necessary to \"tote\" the bark any distance over\r\nthe trail, Fig. 38 shows how to roll it up and how to bind the roll with\r\ncord or rope so that it may be slung on the back as the man is \"toting\" it\r\nin Fig. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding the Pontiac\r\n\r\nTo build a Pontiac, first erect the uprights _E_ and _E_, Fig. 37, then\r\nthe other two similar uprights at the rear and lay the side-plates _G_ in\r\nthe forks of the uprights; next erect the upright _H_ and one in the rear\r\nto correspond, and across this lay the ridge-pole. Next take a couple of\r\nlogs and put them at the foot of the _E_ poles, or, if you want more room,\r\nfurther back toward where the roof poles _F_ will come. Place one of these\r\nlogs on top of the other as shown in Figs. 36 and 39. Keep them in place\r\nby driving sticks on each side of them. Put two more logs upon the other\r\nside of the Pontiac and then lay your roof poles or rafters up against the\r\nside-plates and over the logs as shown in diagrams 36, 37, and 39. Fig. 36\r\nshows the roof partially shingled and the sides partially covered, so that\r\nyou may better understand how it is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nShingling with Bark\r\n\r\nCommence at the bottom and lay the first row with the edges overlapping\r\nfor walls; for the roof you may lay one row of shingles from the bottom up\r\nto the ridge and hold them in place by resting a pole on them; then lay\r\nthe next row of shingles alongside by slipping the edges under the first.\r\nWhen you have the two sides covered, put bark over the ridge as shown in\r\nFig. 36. This will make a beautiful and comfortable little camp.\r\n\r\nFig. 36. Fig. 37. Fig. 38. Fig. 39.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pontiac of birch bark.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Keep Out Cold\r\n\r\nBuilt as here described, the cold wind might come through in the\r\nwinter-time, but if you can gather a lot of Sphagnum moss from the nearest\r\nswamp and cover your roof with it and then shingle that over with another\r\nlayer of birch bark, the cold wind will not come through your roof. If you\r\ntreat your side walls in the same manner and heap dirt up around the edges\r\nof them, you will have a comfortable winter camp.\r\n\r\nIn the winter-time you will find it very difficult to peel the birch bark\r\nor any other kind of bark, but when the sap is flowing it is not so\r\ndifficult to secure bark slabs from many varieties of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nINDIAN COMMUNAL HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the French Communists were raising Cain in Europe they doubtless\r\nthought their idea was practically new, but thousands of years before they\r\nbore the red banner through the streets of Paris the American Indians were\r\nliving quiet and peaceful communal lives on this continent; when I use the\r\nwords _quiet_ and _peaceful_, I, of course, mean as regards their own\r\nparticular commune and not taking into account their attitude toward their\r\nneighbors. The Pueblo Indians built themselves adobe communal houses, the\r\nNez Percés built themselves houses of sticks and dry grass one hundred and\r\nfifty feet long sometimes, containing forty-eight families, while the\r\nNechecolles had houses two hundred and twenty-six feet in length! But this\r\nis not a book of history; all we want to know is how to build shacks for\r\nour own use; so we will borrow one from the communal home of the Iroquois.\r\nIt is not necessary for us to make this one hundred feet long, as the\r\nIroquois Indians did. We can make a diminutive one as a playhouse for our\r\nchildren, a moderate-sized one as a camp for our Boy Scouts, or a\r\ngood-sized one for a party of full-grown campers.\r\n\r\nBut first we must gather a number of long, flexible saplings and plant\r\nthem in two rows with their butt ends in the ground, as shown in Fig. 40,\r\nafter which we may bend their upper ends so that they will overlap each\r\nother and form equal-sized arches, when they are lashed together, with\r\ntwine if we have it, or with wire if it is handy; but if we are real\r\nwoodsmen, we will bind them with rope made of fibres of bark or the\r\nflexible roots which we find in the forests. Then we bind horizontal poles\r\nor rods to the arches, placing the poles about a foot or two apart\r\naccording to the material with which we are to shingle it. We make a\r\nsimple doorway with upright posts at one end and bind the horizontal posts\r\non as we did at the sides. Next we shingle it with bark or with strips of\r\ntar paper and hold the shingles in place by binding poles upon the\r\noutside, as shown in Fig. 41. A hole or holes are left in the roof over\r\nthe fireplaces for openings for the smoke to escape. In lieu of a chimney\r\na wind-shield of bark is fastened at its lower edge by pieces of twine to\r\nthe roof so as to shield the opening; this wind-shield should be movable\r\nso that it may be shifted according to the wind. The Iroquois is an easily\r\nconstructed shelter, useful to man, and one which will delight the heart\r\nof the Boy Scouts or any other set of boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pawnee Hogan\r\n\r\nThe Pawnee hogan is usually covered with sod or dirt, but it may be\r\ncovered with bark, with canvas, or thatched with straw or with browse, as\r\nthe camper may choose. Fig. 42 shows the framework in the skeleton form.\r\nThe rafter poles are placed wigwam fashion and should be very close\r\ntogether in the finished structure; so also should be the short sticks\r\nforming the side walls and the walls to the hallway or entrance. To build\r\nthis hogan, first erect a circle of short forked sticks, setting their\r\nends firmly in the ground. Inside of this erect four longer forked sticks,\r\nthen place across these four horizontal side-plates, or maybe they might\r\nbe more properly called \"purlins,\" in which case the sticks laid on the\r\nforks of the circle of small uprights will properly correspond to the\r\nside-plates of a white man's dwelling. After the circle and square (Fig.\r\n42) have been erected, make your doorway with two short-forked sticks and\r\nyour hallway by sticks running from the door to side-plates. In thatching\r\nyour roof or in covering it with any sort of material, leave an opening at\r\nthe top (Fig. 43) to act as a chimney for your centre camp-fire. If the\r\nroof is to be covered with sod or adobe, cover it first with browse, hay,\r\nstraw, or rushes, making a thick mattress over the entire structure. On\r\ntop of this plaster your mud or sod (Fig. 43). If you intend to use this\r\nhogan as a more or less permanent camp you can put windows in the sides to\r\nadmit light and air and use a hollow log or a barrel for a chimney as\r\nshown in Fig. 44.\r\n\r\nFig. 40. Fig. 41. Fig. 42. Fig. 43. Fig. 44. Fig. 45.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Iroquois, the Pawnee hogan, the white man's hogan, and\r\nthe kolshian.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kolshian\r\n\r\nThe camps thus far described are supposed to be \"tomahawk camps,\" that is,\r\ncamps which may be built without the use of a lumberman's axe. The\r\nkolshian (Fig. 45) of Alaska, when built by the natives, is a large\r\ncommunal council-house, but I have placed it here among the \"tomahawk\r\ncamps\" on the supposition that some one might want to build one in\r\nminiature as a novelty on their place or as a council-room for their young\r\nscouts. The Alaskans hew all the timber out by hand, but, of course, the\r\nreader may use sawed or milled lumber. The proper entrance to a kolshian\r\nor rancheree, as Elliot calls it, is through a doorway made in the huge\r\ntotem-pole at the front of the building. The roof is covered with splits\r\nor shakes held in place by poles laid across them, the sides are made of\r\nhewn planks set upright, and the front has two heavy planks at the eaves\r\nwhich run down through holes in two upright planks at the corners (Fig.\r\n45). These with the sill plank bind the upright wall planks in place.\r\n\r\nThe kolshian is undoubtedly a very ancient form of building and may be\r\nrelated to the houses built by the ancient cavemen of Europe. The first\r\nhuman house-builders are said to belong to the Cro-Magnon race who lived\r\nin caves in the winter-time, and on the walls of one of the caverns\r\n(Dordogne cavern) some Cro-Magnon budding architect made a rough sketch of\r\none of their houses (middle sketch, Fig. 45). When you compare the house\r\nwith the kolshian the resemblance is very striking, and more so when we\r\nremember that the kolshian floor is underground, indicating that it is\r\nrelated to or suggested by a natural cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nBARK AND TAR PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nTO further illustrate the use of bark and tar paper, I have made the\r\nsketches shown by Figs. 46, 47, and 48. Fig. 47 is a log shack with an\r\narched roof drawn from a photograph in my collection. To keep the interior\r\nwarm not only the roof but the sides of the house as well have been\r\nshingled with bark, leaving only the ends of the logs protruding to tell\r\nof what material the house is really constructed. Fig. 47 shows a\r\nfisherman's hut made with a few sticks and bark. Fig. 48 shows a tar paper\r\ncamp, that is, a camp where everything is covered with tar paper in place\r\nof bark. The house is made with a skeleton of poles on which the tar paper\r\nis tacked, the kitchen is an open shed with tar paper roof, and even the\r\ntable is made by covering the cross sticks shown in the diagram with\r\nsheets of tar paper in place of the birch bark usually used for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nPersonally I do not like tar paper; it seems to rob the camp of a true\r\nflavor of the woods; it knocks the sentiment out of it, and, except to\r\nsailors, the odor of the tar is not nearly as delightful as that of the\r\nfragrant balsam boughs. Nevertheless, tar paper is now used in all the\r\nlumber camps and is spreading farther and farther into the woods as the\r\nbirch bark becomes scarce and the \"tote-roads\" are improved.\r\n\r\nWhen one can enter the woods with an automobile, you must expect to find\r\ntar paper camps, because the paper is easily transported, easily handled,\r\nand easily applied for the purpose of the camper.\r\n\r\nFig. 46. Fig. 47. Fig. 48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing use of bark and tar paper.]\r\n\r\nPractically any form of tent may be reproduced by tacking tar paper to\r\nsticks arranged in the proper manner, but if you make a wigwam of tar\r\npaper, do paint it red, green, or yellow, or whitewash it; do anything\r\nwhich will take off the civilized, funereal look of the affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA SAWED-LUMBER SHANTY\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE we proceed any further it may be best to give the plan of a\r\nworkshop, a camp, an outhouse, or a shed to be made of sawed lumber, the\r\nframework of which is made of what is known as two-by-fours, that is,\r\npieces of lumber two inches thick by four inches wide. The plans used here\r\nare from my book \"The Jack of All Trades,\" but the dimensions may be\r\naltered to suit your convenience. The sills, which are four inches by four\r\ninches, are also supposed to be made by nailing two two-by-fours together.\r\nFirst stake out your foundation and see that the corners are square, that\r\nis, at right angles, and test this with a tape or ruler by measuring six\r\nfeet one way and eight feet the other from a corner along the proposed\r\nsides of the house marking these points. If a ten-foot rod will reach\r\nexactly across from point to point, the corner is square and you may dig\r\nyour post-holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\r\n\r\nYou may use a foundation of stones or a series of stone piles, but if you\r\nuse stones and expect your house to remain plumb where the winters are\r\nsevere you must dig holes for them at least three feet deep in order to go\r\nbelow the frost-line. Fill these holes with broken stone, on top of which\r\nyou can make your pile of stones to act as support for the sills; but the\r\nsimplest method is to use posts of locust, cedar, or chestnut; or, if this\r\nis too much trouble, pack the dirt tightly, drain it well by making it\r\nslope away from the house in every direction, and lay your foundation\r\nsills on the level earth. In that case you had better use chestnut wood\r\nfor the sills; spruce will rot very quickly in contact with the damp earth\r\nand pine will not last long under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nAll through certain sections of this country there are hundreds of humble\r\ndwellings built upon \"mudsills,\" in other words, with no foundation or\r\nfloor but the bare ground.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that you have secured some posts about two feet six inches\r\nlong with good, flat ends. The better material you can obtain the trimmer\r\nand better will be the appearance of your house, but a house which will\r\nprotect you and your tools may be made of the roughest lumber.\r\n\r\nThe plans here drawn will answer for the rough or fine material, but we\r\nsuppose that medium material is to be used. It will be taken for granted\r\nthat the reader is able to procure enough two-by-four-inch timber to\r\nsupply studs, ribs, purlins, rafters, beams, and posts for the frame shown\r\nin Fig. 49. Two pieces of four-by-four-inch timber each fifteen feet long\r\nshould be made for sills by nailing two-by-fours together. Add to this\r\nsome tongue-and-grooved boarding or even rough boards for sides and roof,\r\nsome enthusiasm, and good American pluck and the shop is almost as good as\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nFirst lay the foundation, eight by fifteen feet, and then you may proceed\r\nto dig your post-holes. The outside of the posts should be flush or even\r\nwith the outside edges of the sills and end beams of the house as shown in\r\nthe diagram. If there are four posts on each of the long sides they should\r\nbe equal distances apart.\r\n\r\nDig the holes three feet deep, allowing six inches of the posts to\r\nprotrude above ground. If you drive two stakes a short distance beyond the\r\nfoundation in line with your foundation lines and run a string from the\r\ntop of one stake to the top of the other you can, without much trouble,\r\nget it upon a perfect level by testing it and adjusting until the string\r\nrepresents the level for your sill. When this is done, set your posts to\r\ncorrespond to the level of the string, then place your sill on top of the\r\nposts and test that with your level. If found to be correct, fill in the\r\ndirt around the posts and pack it firmly, then spike your sill to the\r\nposts and go through the same operation with opposite sets of posts and\r\nsill.\r\n\r\nFig. 49.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame of two-by-fours milled lumber, with names of parts.]\r\n\r\nThe first difficult work is now done and, with the exception of the roof,\r\nthe rest only needs ordinary care.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that you have already sawed off and prepared about nine\r\ntwo-by-four-inch beams each of which is exactly eight feet long. Set these\r\non edge from sill to sill, equal distances apart, the edges of the end\r\nbeams being exactly even with the ends of the sills as in Fig. 49. See\r\nthat the beams all cross the sills at right angles and toe-nail them in\r\nplace. You may now neatly floor the foundation with one-inch boards; these\r\nboards must be laid lengthwise with the building and crosswise with the\r\nbeams. When this is finished you will have a beautiful platform on which\r\nto work, where you will be in no danger of losing your tools, and you may\r\nuse the floor as a table on which to measure and plan the sides and roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nRidge Plank and Rafters\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to make your ridge plank and rafters while the floor is\r\nclear of rubbish. Lay out and mark on the floor, with a carpenter's soft\r\npencil, a straight line four feet long (_A_, _B_, Fig. 49). At right\r\nangles to this draw another line three feet six inches long (_A_, _D_,\r\nFig. 49). Connect these points (_B_, _D_, Fig. 49) with a straight line,\r\nthen complete the figure _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ (Fig. 49). Allow two inches at\r\nthe top for the ridge plank at _B_ and two by four for the end of the\r\nside-plate at _D_. You then have a pattern for each rafter with a \"plumb\r\nedge\" at _B_ and a \"bird's mouth\" at _D_. The plumb edge must be parallel\r\nwith _B_, _C_ and the two jaws of the \"bird's mouth\" parallel with _D_,\r\n_C_ and _A_, _D_, respectively. Make six rafters of two-by-fours and one\r\nridge plank.\r\n\r\nThe purlins and collar can be made and fitted after the roof is raised.\r\nSet your roof timber carefully to one side and clear the floor for the\r\nstuds, ribs, and plates. First prepare the end posts and make them of\r\ntwo-by-fours. Each post is of two pieces. There will be four outside\r\npieces each five feet eight inches in length, which rest on the end beams,\r\nand four inside pieces each six feet in length; this allows two inches at\r\nthe top for the ends of the end plates to rest upon.\r\n\r\nExamine the corner posts and you will see that the outside two-by-four\r\nrests upon the top side of the end beam and the side-plate rests directly\r\nupon said two-by-four. You will also observe that the inside two-by-four\r\nrests directly upon the sill, which would make the former four inches\r\nlonger than the outside piece if it is extended to the side-plate; but you\r\nwill also notice that there is a notch in the end plate for the outside\r\ncorner piece to fit in and that the end of the end plate fits on top the\r\ninside piece of the corner posts, taking off two inches, which makes the\r\ninside piece just six feet long. This is a very simple arrangement, as may\r\nbe seen by examining the diagram. Besides the corner posts, each of which\r\nwe have seen is made of two pieces of two-by-fours, there are four studs\r\nfor the front side, each six feet two inches long. The short studs shown\r\nin the diagram on the rear side are unnecessary and are only shown so that\r\nthey may be put in as convenient attachments for shelves and tool racks.\r\n\r\nThe first stud on the front is placed two feet from the corner post and\r\nthe second one about six feet six inches from the first, to allow a space\r\nfor a six-foot window; the next two studs form the door-jambs and must be\r\nfar enough from the corner to allow the door to open and swing out of the\r\nway. If you make your door two and one half feet wide--a good size--you\r\nmay set your last stud two feet from the corner post and leave a space of\r\ntwo feet six inches for the doorway. Now mark off on the floor the places\r\nwhere the studs will come, and cut out the flooring at these points to\r\nallow the ends of the studs to enter and rest on the sill. Next make four\r\nribs--one long one to go beneath the window, one short one to fit between\r\nthe corner post and the door stud not shown in diagram, another to fit\r\nbetween the door stud and window stud, and another to fit between the\r\nwindow stud and the first corner post (the nearest corner in the diagram).\r\nNext make your side-plate exactly fifteen feet long. Fit the frame\r\ntogether on the floor and nail the pieces together, toe-nailing the ribs\r\nin place. Get some help and raise the whole side frame and slip the ends\r\nof the studs into their respective slots. Make the end posts plumb and\r\nhold them in place temporarily by a board, one end of which is nailed to\r\nthe top end of the post and the other to the end beam. Such a diagonal\r\nboard at each end will hold the side in place until the opposite side is\r\nraised and similarly supported.\r\n\r\nIt is now a simple thing to slip the end plates in place under the\r\nside-plates until their outside edges are even with the outside of the\r\ncorner posts. A long wire nail driven through the top-plates and end\r\nplates down into the posts at each corner will hold them securely.\r\nToe-nail a rib between the two nearest end posts and make two window studs\r\nand three ribs for the opposite end. The framing now only needs the roof\r\ntimbers to complete the skeleton of your shop. Across from side-plate to\r\nside-plate lay some loose boards for a platform, and standing on these\r\nboards let your assistant lift one end of the ridge plank while with one\r\nnail to each rafter you fasten the two end rafters onto the ridge plank,\r\nfit the jaws of the \"bird's mouth\" over the ends of the side-plates, and\r\nhold them temporarily in place with a \"stay lath\"--that is, a piece of\r\nboard temporarily nailed to rafter and end plate. The other end of the\r\nridge is now resting on the platform at the other end of the house and\r\nthis may be lifted up, for the single nails will allow movement.\r\n\r\nThe rafters are nailed in place with one nail each and a stay lath\r\nfastened on to hold them in place. Test the ends with your plumb-level and\r\nwhen they are found to be correct nail all the rafters securely in place\r\nand stiffen the centre pair with a piece called a \"collar.\" Add four\r\npurlins set at right angles to the rafters and take off your hat and give\r\nthree cheers and do not forget to nail a green bough to your roof tree in\r\naccordance with the ancient and time-honored custom.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the house may be covered with tent-cloth, oilcloth, tin, tar\r\npaper, or the cheapest sort of lumber, and the house may be roofed with\r\nthe same material; but if you can secure good lumber, use thirteen by\r\nseven eighths by nine and one quarter inch, tongue-and-grooved, one side\r\nplaned so that it may be painted; you can make two sideboards out of each\r\npiece six feet six inches in length. Nail the sides on, running the boards\r\nvertically, leaving openings for windows and doors at the proper places.\r\n\r\nIf you have made a triangular edge to your ridge board, it will add to the\r\nfinish and the roof may be neatly and tightly laid with the upper edge of\r\none side protruding a couple of inches over the opposite side and thus\r\nprotecting the joint from rain. Additional security is gained by nailing\r\nwhat are called picket strips (seven eighths by one and three quarter\r\ninches) over each place where the planks join, or the roof may be covered\r\nwith sheathing boards and shingles. It is not necessary here to give the\r\nmany details such as the manufacture of the door and the arrangements of\r\nthe windows, as these small problems can be easily solved by examining\r\ndoors and windows of similar structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nA SOD HOUSE FOR THE LAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE difference between this sod house and the ones used in the arid\r\nregions consists in the fact that the sod will be growing on the sod\r\nhouse, which is intended for and is an ornamental building for the lawn.\r\nPossibly one might say that the sod house is an effete product of\r\ncivilization where utility is sacrificed to display; but it is pretty, and\r\nbeauty is always worth while; besides which the same plans may be used in\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n\r\nA Real Adobe\r\n\r\nand practically are used in some of the desert ranches along the Colorado\r\nRiver. The principal difference in construction between the one shown in\r\nFigs. 50, 53, and 57 and the one in Fig. 55 is that in the sod house the\r\nsod is held in place by chicken-coop wire, while in the ranch-house (Fig.\r\n55) the dirt or adobe is held in place by a number of sticks.\r\n\r\nFig. 50. Fig. 51. Fig. 52. Fig. 53. Fig. 54. Fig. 55. Fig. 56.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A house of green growing sod and the Colorado River\r\nadobe.]\r\n\r\nFig. 50 shows how the double walls are made with a space of at least a\r\nfoot between them; these walls are covered with wire netting or\r\nchicken-coop wire, as shown in Fig. 53, and the space between the walls\r\nfilled in with mud or dirt of any kind. The framework may be made of\r\nmilled lumber, as in Fig. 50, or it may be made of saplings cut on the\r\nriver bank and squared at their ends, as shown by detailed drawings\r\nbetween Figs. 50 and 52. The roof may be made flat, like Figs. 54 and 56,\r\nand covered with poles, as in Fig. 54, in which case the sod will have to\r\nbe held in place by pegging other poles along the eaves as shown in the\r\nleft-hand corner of Fig. 54. This will keep the sod from sliding off the\r\nroof. Or you may build a roof after the manner illustrated by Fig. 49 and\r\nFig. 51, that is, if you want to make a neat, workmanlike house; but any\r\nof the ways shown by Fig. 52 will answer for the framework of the roof.\r\nThe steep roof, however, must necessarily be either shingled or thatched\r\nor the sod held in place by a covering of wire netting. If you are\r\nbuilding this for your lawn, set green, growing sod up edgewise against\r\nthe wire netting, after the latter has been tacked to your frame, so\r\narranging the sod that the green grass will face the outside. If you wish\r\nto plaster the inside of your house with cement or concrete, fill in\r\nbehind with mud, plaster the mud against the sod and put gravel and stones\r\nagainst the mud so that it will be next to the wire netting on the inside\r\nof the house over which you plaster the concrete. If you make the roof\r\nshown in Fig. 54, cover it first with hay and then dirt and sod and hold\r\nthe sod down with wire netting neatly tacked over it, or cover it with\r\ngravel held in place by wire netting and spread concrete over the top as\r\none does on a cellar floor. If the walls are kept sprinkled by the help of\r\nthe garden hose, the grass will keep as green as that on your lawn, and if\r\nyou have a dirt roof you may allow purple asters and goldenrod to grow\r\nupon it (Fig. 62) or plant it with garden flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThatch\r\n\r\nIf you are going to make a thatched roof, soak your thatch in water and\r\nstraighten the bent straws; build the roof steep like the one shown in\r\nFig. 57 and make a wooden needle a foot long and pointed at both ends as\r\nshown in Fig. 59; tie your thatching twine to the middle of the needle,\r\nthen take your rye or wheat straw, hay, or bulrushes, gather it into\r\nbundles four inches thick and one foot wide, like those shown in Fig. 60,\r\nand lay them along next to the eaves of your house as in Fig. 58. Sew them\r\nin place by running the needle up through the wire netting to the man on\r\nthe outside who in turn pushes it back to the man on the inside. Make a\r\nknot at each wisp of the thatch until one layer is finished, let the lower\r\nends overhang the eaves, then proceed as illustrated by Fig. 66 and\r\ndescribed under the heading of the bog ken.\r\n\r\nIf in place of a simple ornament you want to make a real house of it and a\r\npretty one at that, fill up the space between the walls with mud and\r\nplaster it on the outside with cement or concrete and you will have a\r\ncheap concrete house. The wire netting will hold the plaster or the\r\nconcrete and consequently it is not necessary to make the covering of\r\ncement as thick as in ordinary buildings, for after the mud is dried upon\r\nthe inside it will, with its crust of cement or plaster, be practically as\r\ngood as a solid concrete wall.\r\n\r\nFig. 57. Fig. 58. Fig. 59. Fig. 60. Fig. 61. Fig. 62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ornamental sod house for the lawn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD ELEVATED SHACKS, SHANTIES, AND SHELTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR many reasons it is sometimes necessary or advisable to have one's camp\r\non stilts, so to speak. Especially is this true in the more tropical\r\ncountries where noxious serpents and insects abound. A simple form of\r\nstilted shack is shown by Fig. 63. To build this shack we must first erect\r\nan elevated platform (Fig. 64). This is made by setting four forked sticks\r\nof equal height in the ground and any height from the ground to suit the\r\nideas of the camp builder. If, for some reason, the uprights are \"wabbly\"\r\nthe frame may be stiffened by lashing diagonal cross sticks to the frame.\r\nAfter you have erected the four uprights, lay two poles through the\r\ncrotches, as in Fig. 64, and make a platform by placing other poles across\r\nthese, after which a shelter may be made in the form of an open Adirondack\r\ncamp or any of the forms previously described. Fig. 65 shows the framework\r\nfor the open camp of Adirondack style with the uprights lashed to the side\r\nbars; if you have nails, of course, you can nail these together, but these\r\nplans are made on the assumption that you have no nails for that purpose,\r\nwhich will probably be true if you have been long in the woods.\r\n\r\nFig. 63. Fig. 64. Fig. 65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A simple stilt camp.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE BOG KEN\r\n\r\n\r\nKEN is a name now almost obsolete but the bog ken is a house built on\r\nstilts where the ground is marshy, damp, and unfit to sleep upon. As you\r\nwill see by the diagram (Fig. 66), the house is built upon a platform\r\nsimilar to the one last described; in this instance, however, the shelter\r\nitself is formed by a series of arches similar to the Iroquois (Fig. 41).\r\nThe uprights on the two sides have their ends bent over and lashed\r\ntogether, forming arches for the roof. Over the arches are lashed\r\nhorizontal poles the same as those described in the construction of the\r\nIroquois lodge. Fig. 67 shows one way to prevent \"varmints\" of any kind\r\nfrom scaling the supporting poles and creeping into your camp.\r\n\r\nThe protection consists of a tin pan with a hole in the bottom slid over\r\nthe supporting poles. Fig. 66 shows how to lash the thatching on to the\r\npoles and Fig. 68 shows how to spring the sticks in place for a railing\r\naround your front porch or balcony.\r\n\r\nThe floor to this bog ken is a little more elaborate than that of the last\r\ndescribed camp because the poles have all been halved before laying them\r\nfor the floor. These are supposed to be afterwards covered with browse,\r\nhay, or rushes and the roof shingled with bark or thatched.\r\n\r\n\r\nThatching\r\n\r\nSoak your straw or hay well in water and smooth it out flat and regular.\r\nThe steeper the roofs the longer the thatch will last. In this bog ken our\r\nroof happens to be a rounded one, an arched roof; but it is sheltering a\r\ntemporary house and the thatch will last as long as the shack. While the\r\nreal pioneer uses whatever material he finds at hand, it does no harm for\r\nhim to know that to make a really good thatch one should use only straw\r\nwhich is fully ripe and has been thrashed clean with an old-fashioned\r\nflail. The straw must be clear of all seed or grain and kept straight, not\r\nmussed up, crumpled, and broken. If any grain is left in the straw it will\r\nattract field-mice, birds, domestic mice and rats, domestic turkeys and\r\nchickens, and these creatures in burrowing and scratching for food will\r\nplay havoc with the roof.\r\n\r\nFig. 66. Fig. 67. Fig. 68. Fig. 69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of bog ken.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have straight and even rafters, because the humps,\r\nbumps, and hollows caused by crooked sticks are concealed by the mattress\r\nof straw. Take a bundle of thatch in your hands, squeeze it together, and\r\nplace it so that the butt ends project about three inches beyond the floor\r\n(_A_, Fig. 66); tie the thatch closely to the lower rafter and the one\r\nnext above it, using for the purpose twine, marlin, raffia, or\r\nwell-twisted white hickory bark. This first row should be thus tied near\r\nboth ends to prevent the wind from getting under it and lifting it up.\r\nNext put on another row of wisps of thatch over the first and the butt\r\nends come even with the first, but tie this one to the third row of\r\nrafters not shown in diagram. The butts of the third row of thatch (_B_,\r\nFig. 66) should be about nine inches up on the front rows; put this on as\r\nbefore and proceed the same way with _C_, _D_, _E_, and _F_, Fig. 66,\r\nuntil the roof is completed. The thatch should be ten or twelve inches\r\nthick for a permanent hut but need not be so for a temporary shed.\r\n\r\nAs there is no comb to this roof the top must be protected where the\r\nthatches from each side join, and to do this fasten a thatch over the top\r\nand bind it on both sides but not in the middle, so that it covers the\r\nmeeting of the thatches on both sides of the shack; this top piece should\r\nbe stitched or bound on with wire if you have it, or fastened with willow\r\nwithe or even wisps of straw if you are an expert. A house, twenty by\r\nthirty feet, made of material found on the place and thatched with straw\r\ncosts the builder only fifty cents for nails and four days' work for two\r\npersons. A good thatched roof will last as long as a modern shingle roof,\r\nfor in olden days when shingles were good and split out of blocks, not\r\nsawed, and were well seasoned before using, they were not expected to last\r\nmuch over fifteen years; a well-made thatched roof will last fifteen or\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nFig. 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snow-shoe foundation for bog ken.]\r\n\r\nBut a real bog ken is one that is built over boggy or marshy places too\r\nsoft to support an ordinary structure. To overcome this difficulty\r\nrequired considerable study and experiment, but at length the author hit\r\nupon a simple plan which has proved effective. If you wish to build a duck\r\nhunter's camp on the soft meadows, or for any other reason you desire a\r\ncamp on treacherous, boggy ground, you may build one by first making a\r\nthick mattress of twigs and sticks as shown by Fig. 70. This mattress acts\r\non the principle of a snow-shoe and prevents your house from sinking by\r\ndistributing the weight equally over a wide surface. The mattress should\r\nbe carefully made of sticks having their branches trimmed off sufficiently\r\nto allow them to lie in regular courses as in the diagram. The first\r\ncourse should be laid one way and the next course at right angles to the\r\nfirst, and so on, until the mattress is sufficiently thick for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nStanding on the mattress, it will be an easy matter with your hands to\r\nforce the sharpened ends of your upright posts _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_ down\r\ninto the yielding mud, but be careful not to push them too far because in\r\nsome of these marshes the mud is practically bottomless. It is only\r\nnecessary for the supports to sink in the mud far enough to make them\r\nstand upright.\r\n\r\nFig. 71.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Framework of simple bog ken.]\r\n\r\nThe next step is to lay, at right angles to the top layer of brush, a\r\nseries of rods or poles between your uprights as shown in Fig. 70; then\r\ntake two more poles, place them at right angles to the last ones, and\r\npress them down until they fit snugly on top of the other poles, and there\r\nnail them fast to the uprights as shown in Fig. 70, after which to further\r\nbind them you may nail a diagonal from _A_ to _D_ and _B_ to _C_, but this\r\nmay not be necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen you have proceeded thus far you may erect a framework like that shown\r\nin Fig. 71, and build a platform by flooring the crosspieces or horizontal\r\nbars with halves of small logs, Fig. 71.\r\n\r\nIt is now a simple matter to erect a shack which may be roofed with bark\r\nas in Fig. 72 or thatched as in Fig. 74. Fig. 72 shows the unfinished\r\nshack in order that its construction may be easily seen; this one is being\r\nroofed with birch bark. A fireplace may be made by enclosing a bed of mud\r\n(Fig. 73) between or inside of the square formed by four logs. On this\r\nclay or mud you can build your camp-fire or cooking fire or mosquito\r\nsmudge with little or no danger of setting fire to your house.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito smudge will not be found necessary if there is any breeze\r\nblowing at all, because these insects cling to the salt hay or bog-grass\r\nand do not rise above it except in close, muggy weather where no breeze\r\ndisturbs them. I have slept a few feet over bog meadows without being\r\ndisturbed by mosquitoes when every blade of grass on the meadows was black\r\nwith these insects, but there was a breeze blowing which kept the\r\nmosquitoes at home.\r\n\r\nFig. 72. Fig. 73. Fig. 74.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adaptation of a bark shack to the bog ken foundation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nOVER-WATER CAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW that we know how to camp on solid ground and on the quaking bog we\r\ncannot finish up the subject of stilt camps without including one\r\nover-water camp. If the water has a muddy bottom it is a simple matter to\r\nforce your supporting posts into the mud; this may be done by driving them\r\nin with a wooden mallet made of a section of log or it may be done by\r\nfastening poles on each side of the post and having a crowd of men jump up\r\nand down on the poles until the posts are forced into the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf you are building a pretentious structure the piles may be driven with\r\nthe ordinary pile-driver. But if your camp on the water is over a hard\r\nbottom of rock or sand through which you cannot force your supports you\r\nmay take a lot of old barrels (Fig. 75), knock the tops and bottoms out of\r\nthem, nail some cross planks on the ends of your spiles, slide the barrels\r\nover the spiles, then set them in place in the water and hold them there\r\nby filling the barrels with rocks, stones, or coarse gravel. Fig. 77 shows\r\na foundation made in this manner; this method is also useful in building\r\npiers (Fig. 78). But if you are in the woods, out of reach of barrels or\r\nother civilized lumber, you can make yourself cribs by driving a square or\r\na circle of sticks in the ground a short distance and then twining roots\r\nor pliable branches inside and outside the stakes, basket fashion, as\r\nshown in Fig. 76. When the crib is complete it may be carefully removed\r\nfrom the ground and used as the barrels were used by filling them with\r\nstones to support the uprights. Fig. 79 shows an ordinary portable house\r\nsuch as are advertised in all the sportsmen's papers, which has been\r\nerected upon a platform over the water.\r\n\r\nFig. 75. Fig. 76. Fig. 77. Fig. 78. Fig. 79.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing how to make foundations for over-water camps.]\r\n\r\nMy experience with this sort of work leads me to advise the use of piles\r\nupon which to build in place of piers of stones. Where I have used such\r\npiers upon small inland lakes the tremendous push of the freezing ice has\r\nupset them, whereas the ice seems to slide around the piles without\r\npushing them over. The real danger with piles lies in the fact that if the\r\nwater rises after the ice has frozen around the uprights the water will\r\nlift the ice up and the ice will sometimes pull the piles out of the\r\nbottom like a dentist pulls teeth. Nevertheless, piles are much better for\r\na foundation for a camp or pier than any crib of rocks, and that is the\r\nreason I have shown the cribs in Figs. 75 and 77, made so as to rest upon\r\nthe bottom supposedly below the level of the winter ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nSIGNAL-TOWER, GAME LOOKOUT, AND RUSTIC OBSERVATORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIF my present reader happens to be a Boy Scout or a scout-master who wants\r\nthe scouts to build a tower for exhibition purposes, he can do so by\r\nfollowing the directions here given, but if there is real necessity for\r\nhaste in the erection of this tower, of course we cannot build one as tall\r\nas we might where we have more time. With a small tower all the joints may\r\nbe quickly lashed together with strong, heavy twine, rope, or even wire;\r\nand in the wilderness it will probably be necessary to bind the joints\r\nwith pliable roots, or cordage made of bark or withes; but as this is not\r\na book on woodcraft we will suppose that the reader has secured the proper\r\nmaterial for fastening the joints of the frame of this signal-tower and he\r\nmust now shoulder his axe and go to the woods in order to secure the\r\nnecessary timber. First let him cut eight straight poles--that is, as\r\nstraight as he can find them. These poles should be about four and one\r\nhalf inches in diameter at their base and sixteen and one half feet long.\r\nAfter all the branches are trimmed off the poles, cut four more sticks\r\neach nine feet long and two and a half or three inches in diameter at the\r\nbase; when these are trimmed into shape one will need twenty six or seven\r\nmore stout sticks each four and one half feet long for braces and for\r\nflooring for the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nKite Frame\r\n\r\nIt being supposed that your timber is now all in readiness at the spot\r\nwhere you are to erect the tower, begin by laying out on the ground what\r\nwe call the \"kite frame.\" First take three of the four-and-one-half-foot\r\nsticks, _A_, _B_, _C_ (Fig. 82), and two of the nine-foot sticks _D_ and\r\n_E_ (Fig. 82), and, placing them on a level stretch of ground, arrange\r\nthem in the form of a parallelogram. Put _A_ for the top rail at the top\r\nof the parallelogram and _C_ for the bottom of the parallelogram and let\r\nthem rest upon the sides _D_ and _E_, but put _B_ under the sides _D_ and\r\n_E_. In order to bind these together securely, the ends of all the sticks\r\nmust be allowed to project a few inches. _B_ should be far enough below\r\n_A_ to give the proper height for a railing around the platform. The\r\nplatform itself rests upon _B_. _A_ forms the top railing to the fence\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nNow take two of your sixteen-and-one-half-foot poles and place them\r\ndiagonally from corner to corner of the parallelogram with the small ends\r\nof the poles lying over the ends of _A_ and the butt ends of the poles\r\nextending beyond _C_, as in Fig. 82. Lash these poles securely in place.\r\n\r\nWhere the poles cross each other in the _X_, or centre, it is best to\r\nflatten them some by scoring and hewing with a hatchet, but care must be\r\ntaken not to weaken them by scoring too deep. Next take your lash rope,\r\ndouble it, run the loop down under the cross sticks, bring it up on the\r\nother side, as in Fig. 83, then pull the two loose ends through the loop.\r\nWhen they are drawn taut (Fig. 84), bend them round in opposite\r\ndirections--that is, bend the right-hand end of the rope to the right,\r\ndown and under the cross sticks, pull it out to the left, as in Fig. 84,\r\nthen bend the left-hand piece of rope to the left, down and under, pulling\r\nit out to the right, as in Fig. 84. Next bring those two pieces up over\r\nand tie them together in a square knot, as shown in Figs. 85 and 86.\r\n\r\nFig. 80. Fig. 81. Fig. 82. Fig. 83. Fig. 84. Fig. 85. Fig. 86.\r\nFig. 87.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts of tower for a wireless, a game lookout, an elevated\r\ncamp or cache.]\r\n\r\nMake a duplicate \"kite\" frame for the other side exactly as you made the\r\nfirst one, and then arrange these two pieces on the ground with the cross\r\nsticks _F_ and _F_ on the under-side and with their butt ends opposite the\r\nbutts of the similar poles on the other frame and about five feet apart.\r\nFasten a long line to the point where the two _F_ pieces cross each other\r\nand detail a couple of scouts to hold each of the butt ends from slipping\r\nby placing one of their feet against the butt, as in Fig. 82, while two\r\ngangs of men or boys pull on the ropes and raise the kite frames to the\r\npositions shown in Figs. 81 and 88.\r\n\r\nBe careful, when raising the frames, not to pull them too far so that they\r\nmay fall on some unwary workman. When the frames are once erected it is an\r\neasy matter to hold them in place by guy-ropes fastened to stones, stakes,\r\nor trees or held by men or boys, while some of the shorter braces are\r\nfastened to hold the two kite frames together, as in Fig. 90, wherein you\r\nmay see these short braces at the top and bottom. Next, the two other long\r\nsticks, legs, or braces (_G_, _G_, Figs. 89 and 90) should be held\r\ntemporarily in position and the place marked where they cross each other\r\nin the centre of the parallelogram which should be the same as it is on\r\nthe legs of the two kite frames. The _G_ sticks should now be lashed\r\ntogether at the crossing point, as already described and shown by Figs.\r\n83, 84, 85, and 86, when they may be put up against the sides, as in Fig.\r\n89, in which diagram the _G_ poles are made very dark and the kite frames\r\nindicated very lightly so as to better show their relative positions. Lash\r\nthe _G_ poles at the top and at the other points where they cross the\r\nother braces and secure the framework by adding short braces, as indicated\r\nin Fig. 90.\r\n\r\nFig. 88. Fig. 89. Fig. 90. Fig. 90A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of scout signal-tower or game lookout.]\r\n\r\nIf all the parts are bound together with wire it will hold them more\r\nsecurely than nails, with no danger of the poles splitting. A permanent\r\ntower of this kind may be erected on which a camp may be built, as shown\r\nin Fig. 87. It may be well to note that in the last diagram the tower is\r\nonly indicated by a few lines of the frame in order to simplify it and\r\nprevent confusion caused by the multiplicity of poles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoy-Scout Tower\r\n\r\nIf you desire to make a tower taller than the one described it would be\r\nbest, perhaps, to take the regular Boy-Scout dimensions as given by\r\nScout-master A. G. Clarke:\r\n\r\n\"Eight pieces 22 feet long, about 5 or 6 inches thick at the base; 4\r\npieces 6 feet long, about 3 or 4 inches thick at the base; 12 pieces 6\r\nfeet long, about 2½ or 3 inches thick at base; 12 or 15 pieces for braces\r\nand platform about 6 feet long.\"\r\n\r\nWhen putting together this frame it may be nailed or spiked, but care must\r\nbe used not to split the timber where it is nailed. With most wood this\r\nmay be avoided by driving the spikes or nails several inches back of the\r\nends of the sticks. To erect a flagpole or a wireless pole, cut the bottom\r\nof the pole wedge-shaped, fit in the space between the cross poles, as in\r\nFig. 90 _A_, then lash it fast to the _B_ and _A_ pole, and, to further\r\nsecure it, two other sticks may be nailed to the _F_ poles, one on each\r\nside, between which the bottom of the flagpole is thrust, as shown by Fig.\r\n90 _A_.\r\n\r\nThe flooring of the platform must be securely nailed or lashed in place,\r\notherwise there may be some serious accident caused by the boys or men\r\nfalling through, a fall of about twenty and one half feet according to the\r\nlast measurements given for the frame.\r\n\r\nAn observatory of this kind will add greatly to the interest of a mountain\r\nhome or seaside home; it is a practical tower for military men to be used\r\nin flag signalling and for improvised wireless; it is also a practical\r\ntower for a lookout in the game fields and a delight to the Boy Scouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTREE-TOP HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the natural process of evolution we have now arrived at the tree-top\r\nhouse. It is interesting to the writer to see the popularity of this style\r\nof an outdoor building, for, while he cannot lay claim to originating it,\r\nhe was the first to publish the working drawings of a tree-house. These\r\nplans first appeared in _Harper's Round Table_; afterward he made others\r\nfor the _Ladies' Home Journal_ and later published them in \"The Jack of\r\nAll Trades.\"\r\n\r\nHaving occasion to travel across the continent shortly after the first\r\nplans were published, he was amused to see all along the route, here and\r\nthere in back-yard fruit-trees, shade-trees, and in forest-trees, queer\r\nlittle shanties built by the boys, high up among the boughs.\r\n\r\nIn order to build a house one must make one's plans _to fit the tree_. If\r\nit is to be a one-tree house, spike on the trunk two quartered pieces of\r\nsmall log one on each side of the trunk (Figs. 91 and 92). Across these\r\nlay a couple of poles and nail them to the trunk of the tree (Fig. 91);\r\nthen at right angles to these lay another pair of poles, as shown in the\r\nright-hand diagram (Fig. 91). Nail these securely in place and support the\r\nends of the four poles by braces nailed to the trunk of the tree below.\r\nThe four cross-sills will then (Fig. 95) serve as a foundation upon which\r\nto begin your work. Other joists can now be laid across these first and\r\nsupported by braces running diagonally down to the trunk of the tree, as\r\nshown in Fig. 95. After the floor is laid over the joist any form of\r\nshack, from a rude, open shed to a picturesque thatch-roofed cottage, may\r\nbe erected upon it. It is well to support the two middle rafters of your\r\nroof by quartered pieces of logs, as the middle rafters are supported in\r\nFig. 95; by quartered logs shown in Fig. 92.\r\n\r\nFig. 91. Fig. 92. Fig. 93. Fig. 94. Fig. 95. Fig. 96. Fig. 97.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of tree-top houses.]\r\n\r\nIf the house is a two-tree house, run your cross-sill sticks from trunk to\r\ntrunk, as in Fig. 94; then make two T-braces, like the one in Fig. 94 _A_,\r\nof two-inch planks with braces secured by iron straps, or use heavier\r\ntimber, and bolt the parts together securely (Fig. 93), or use logs and\r\npoles (Fig. 94), after which hang these T's over the ends of your two\r\ncross sticks, as in Fig. 94, and spike the uprights of the T's securely to\r\nthe tree trunks. On top of the T you can rest a two-by-four and support\r\nthe end by diagonals nailed to the tree trunk (Fig. 94) after the manner\r\nof the diagonals in Fig. 95. You will note in Fig. 95 that cleats or\r\nblocks are spiked to the tree below the end of the diagonals in order to\r\nfurther secure them. It is sometimes necessary in a two-tree house to\r\nallow for the movement of the tree trunks. In Florida a gentleman did this\r\nby building his tree-house on the _B_ sills (Fig. 94) and making them\r\nmovable to allow for the play of the tree trunks. Fig. 96 shows a two-tree\r\nhouse and Fig. 97 shows a thatch-roofed cottage built among the top\r\nbranches of a single tree.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in a high wind one does not want to stay long\r\nin a tree-top house; in fact, during some winds that I have experienced I\r\nwould have felt much safer had I been in a cyclone cellar; but if the\r\nbraces of a tree-house are securely made and the trees selected have good,\r\nheavy trunks, your tree-top house will stand all the ordinary summer blows\r\nand winter storms. One must remember that even one's own home is not\r\nsecure enough to stand some of those extraordinary gales, tornadoes, and\r\nhurricanes which occasionally visit parts of our country.\r\n\r\nSince I published the first plans of a tree-top house many people have\r\nadopted the idea and built quite expensive structures in the boughs of the\r\ntrees. Probably all these buildings are intact at the present writing.\r\n\r\nThe boys at Lynn, Mass., built a very substantial house in the trees, and\r\nthe truant officer claimed that the lads hid away there so that they could\r\nplay \"hookey\" from school; but if this is true, and there seems to be some\r\ndoubt about it, it must be remembered that the fault was probably with\r\n_the schools_ and not the boys, for boys who have ingenuity and grit\r\nenough to build a substantial house in a tree cannot be bad boys;\r\nindustry, skill, and laborious work are not the attributes of the bad boy.\r\n\r\nSome New York City boys built a house in the trees at One Hundred and\r\nSixty-ninth Street, but here the police interfered, claiming that it was\r\nagainst a city ordinance to build houses in shade-trees, and maybe it is;\r\nbut, fortunately for the boys, there are other trees which may be used for\r\nthis purpose. There is now, or was recently, an interesting tree-house on\r\nFlatbush Avenue, Brooklyn; a house so commodious that it was capable of\r\naccommodating as many as fifteen people; but it was not as pretty and\r\nattractive a tree-house as the one located at the foot of Mount Tamalpais,\r\nin Mill Valley, San Francisco, which is built after the plan shown by Fig.\r\n95. This California house is attached to the trunk of a big redwood tree\r\nand is reached by a picturesque bridge spanning a rocky canyon.\r\n\r\nTree-houses are also used as health resorts, and recently there was a\r\ngentleman of Plainfield, Mass., living in a tree-house because he found\r\nthe pure air among the leaves beneficial; while down in Ecuador another\r\nman, who feared malarial mosquitoes and objected to wild beasts and\r\nsnakes, built himself a house on top of an ibo-tree, seventy feet from the\r\nground. This is quite a pretentious structure and completely hides and\r\ncovers the top of the tree. It is located on the banks of the Escondido\r\nRiver; and in this tropical country, while it may be a safe retreat from\r\nthe pests enumerated, it might not be so safe from lightning in one of\r\nthose violent tropical storms. But it is probably as safe as any house in\r\nthat country, for one must take chances no matter what kind of a house one\r\ndwells in.\r\n\r\nPrimitive and savage men all over the world for thousands of years have\r\nbuilt dwellings in tree tops. In the Philippines many natives live in\r\ntree-top houses. The Kinnikars, hill-tribesmen of Travancore, India, are\r\nsaid to live in houses built in the trees, but in New Guinea it seems that\r\nsuch houses are only provided for the girls, and every night the dusky\r\nlassies are sent to bed in shacks perched in the tree tops; then, to make\r\nsafety doubly safe, the watchful parents take away the ladders and their\r\ndaughters cannot reach the ground until the ladders are replaced in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about all this is that a tree-house is always a\r\nsource of delight to the boys and young people, and, furthermore, the boys\r\nhave over and over again proved to the satisfaction of the author that\r\nthey themselves are perfectly competent to build these shacks, and not\r\nonly to build them but to avoid accidents and serious falls while engaged\r\nin the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nCACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE difference between tomahawk shacks and axe houses reminds me of the\r\ndifference between the ileum and the jejunum, of which my classmate once\r\nsaid: \"There is no way of telling the beginning of one or the ending of\r\nt'other 'cept by the pale-pinkish hue of the latter.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that some of the shacks described in the preceding\r\npages are rather stout and massive to be classed as tomahawk shelters,\r\nbut, as indicated by my reference to physiology, this is not the writer's\r\nfault. The trouble is owing to the fact that nature abhors the arbitrary\r\ndivision line which man loves to make for his own convenience. The\r\ntomahawk shacks gradually evolve into axe camps and houses and \"there is\r\nno telling the beginning of one and the end of t'other.\" Hence, when I say\r\nthat all the previous shacks, sheds, shelters, and shanties are fashioned\r\nwith a hatchet, the statement must be accepted as true only so far as _it\r\nis_ possible to build them without an axe; but in looking over the diagram\r\nit is evident at a glance that the logs are growing so thick that the\r\nnecessity of the woodman's axe is more and more apparent; nevertheless,\r\nthe accompanying caches have been classed with the tomahawk group and we\r\nwill allow them to remain there.\r\n\r\nWherever man travels in the wilderness he finds it necessary to\r\ncache--that is, hide or secure some of his goods or provisions. The\r\nsecurity of these caches (Figs. 98-111) is considered sacred in the wilds\r\nand they are not disturbed by savages or whites; but bears, foxes, husky\r\ndogs, porcupines, and wolverenes are devoid of any conscientious scruples\r\nand unless the cache is absolutely secure they will raid it.\r\n\r\nFig. 98. Fig. 99. Fig. 100. Fig. 101. Fig. 102. Fig. 103. Fig. 104.\r\nFig. 105.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple forms of caches.]\r\n\r\nThe first cache (Fig. 98) is called the \"prospector's cache\" and consists\r\nsimply of a stick lashed to two trees and another long pole laid across\r\nthis to which the goods are hung, swinging beneath like a hammock. This\r\ncache is hung high enough to be out of reach of a standing bear.\r\n\r\nThe tripod cache (Fig. 100) consists of three poles lashed at the top with\r\nthe goods hung underneath.\r\n\r\nAnother form of the prospector's cache is shown by Fig. 102, where two\r\npoles are used in place of one and an open platform of sticks laid across\r\nthe poles; the goods are placed upon the platform.\r\n\r\nThe tenderfoot's cache (Fig. 105) is one used only for temporary purposes\r\nas it is too easily knocked over and would be of no use where animals as\r\nlarge as bears might wreck it. It consists of two sticks lashed together\r\nat their small ends and with their butt ends buried in the earth; their\r\ntops are secured by a rope to a near-by tree while the duffel is suspended\r\nfrom the top of the longest pole.\r\n\r\nThe \"Montainais\" cache is an elevated platform upon which the goods are\r\nplaced and covered with skins or tarpaulin or tent-cloth (Fig. 99).\r\n\r\nThe \"Andrew Stone\" cache is a miniature log cabin placed on the ground and\r\nthe top covered with halved logs usually weighted down with stones (Fig.\r\n101).\r\n\r\nThe \"Belmore Browne\" cache consists of a pole or a half of a log placed in\r\nthe fork of the two trees on top of which the goods are held in place by a\r\nrope and the whole covered with a piece of canvas lashed together with\r\neyelets, like a shoe (Fig. 103).\r\n\r\nThe \"Herschel Parker\" cache is used where the articles to be cached are in\r\na box. For this cache two poles are lashed to two trees, one on each side\r\nof the trees (Fig. 104), and across the two poles the box is placed.\r\n\r\nWe now come to more pretentious caches, the first of which is the\r\n\"Susitna,\" which is a little log cabin built on a table with four long\r\nlegs. The poles or logs composing the legs of the table are cut in a\r\npeculiar fashion, as shown in the diagram to the left of Fig. 107; this is\r\nintended to prevent animals from climbing to the top; also, as a further\r\nprotection, pieces of tin are sometimes tacked around the poles so as to\r\ngive no foothold to the claws of the little animals.\r\n\r\nFig. 106 shows two other methods sometimes adopted to protect small caches\r\nand Fig. 108 is still another method of using logs which have the roots\r\nstill attached to them for supports. Such logs can be used where the\r\nground is too stony to dig holes for posts.\r\n\r\nFig. 109 shows another form of the Susitna cache wherein the goods are\r\npacked in a box-like structure and covered with tent-cloth tightly lashed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe \"Dillon Wallace\" cache (Fig. 110) is simply a tent erected over the\r\ngoods and perched on an elevated platform.\r\n\r\nThe \"Fred Vreeland\" cache is a good, solid, practical storehouse. It is\r\nbuilt of small logs on a platform, as shown by Fig. 111, and the bottom of\r\nthe building is smaller than it is at the eaves. It is covered with a high\r\nthatched roof and is ornamental as well as useful.\r\n\r\nFig. 106. Fig. 107. Fig. 108. Fig. 109. Fig. 110. Fig. 111.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cabin caches.]\r\n\r\nThese caches might really belong to a book of woodcraft, but it is another\r\ncase of the \"ileum and jejunum,\" and we will rule that they technically\r\ncome under the head of shacks, sheds, shelters, and shanties and so are\r\nincluded in this volume; but there is another and a very good reason for\r\npublishing them in this book, and that is because some of them, like Figs.\r\n107 and 111, suggest novel forms of ornamental houses on country estates,\r\nhouses which may be used for corn-cribs or other storage or, like the\r\ntree-top houses, used for pleasure and amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE AN AXE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE old backwoodsmen were as expert with their axes as they were with\r\ntheir rifles and they were just as careful in the selection of these tools\r\nas they were in the selection of their arms. Many a time I have seen them\r\npick up a \"store\" axe, sight along the handle, and then cast it\r\ncontemptuously aside; they demanded of their axes that the cutting edge\r\nshould be exactly in line with the point in the centre of the butt end of\r\nthe handle. They also kept their axes so sharp that they could whittle\r\nwith them like one can with a good jack-knife; furthermore, they allowed\r\n_no one_ but themselves to use their own particular axe. In my log house\r\nin the mountains of Pike County, Pa., I have a table fashioned entirely\r\nwith an axe; even the ends of the boards which form the top of the table\r\nwere cut off by Siley Rosencranz with his trusty axe because he had no\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nBoth General Grant and Abraham Lincoln were expert axemen, and probably a\r\nnumber of other Presidents were also skilful in the use of this tool; but\r\nit is not expected that the modern vacation pioneer shall be an expert,\r\nconsequently a few simple rules and suggestions will be here given to\r\nguide the amateur and he must depend upon his own judgment and common\r\nsense to work out the minor problems which will beset him in the use of\r\nthis tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nDangers\r\n\r\nAll edged tools are dangerous when in the hands of \"chumps,\" dangerous to\r\nthemselves and to any one else who is near them. For instance, only a\r\nchump will use an axe when its head is loose and is in danger of flying\r\noff the handle; only a chump will use his _best_ axe to cut roots or\r\nsticks lying flat on the ground where he is liable to strike stones and\r\nother objects and take the edge off the blade. Only a chump will leave an\r\naxe lying around on the ground for people to stumble over; if there is a\r\nstump handy at your camp and you are through using the axe, strike the\r\nblade into the top of the stump and leave the axe sticking there, where it\r\nwill be safe from injury.\r\n\r\nRemember, before chopping down a tree or before using the axe at all, to\r\nsee that there is enough space above and around you to enable you to swing\r\nthe axe clear (Fig. 112) without the danger of striking bushes or\r\noverhanging branches which may deflect the blade and cause accidents more\r\nor less serious.\r\n\r\nDo not stand behind a tree as it falls (Fig. 115), for the boughs may\r\nstrike those of a standing tree, causing the butt to shoot back or \"kick,\"\r\nand many a woodsman has lost his life from the kick of a falling tree.\r\nBefore chopping a tree down, select the place where it is to fall, a place\r\nwhere it will not be liable to lodge in another tree on its way down. Do\r\nnot try to fell a tree against the wind.\r\n\r\nCut a notch on the side of the tree facing the direction you wish it to\r\nfall (Fig. 113) and cut it half-way through the trunk. Make the notch, or\r\nkerf, large enough to avoid pinching your axe in it. If you discover that\r\nthe notch is going to be too small, cut a new notch, _X_ (Fig. 116), some\r\ninches above your first one, then split off the piece _X_, _Y_ between the\r\ntwo notches, and again make the notch _X_, _Z_, and split off the piece\r\n_Z_, _W_, _Y_ (Fig. 116), until you make room for the axe to continue your\r\nchopping. When the first kerf is finished begin another one on the\r\nopposite side of the tree a little higher than the first one (Fig. 114).\r\nWhen the wood between the two notches becomes too small to support the\r\nweight of the tree, the top of the tree will begin to tremble and waver\r\nand give you plenty of time to step to one side before it falls.\r\n\r\nFig. 112. Fig. 113. Fig. 114. Fig. 115. Fig. 116. Fig. 117. Fig.\r\n118.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to \"fall\" a tree and how to take off the bark.]\r\n\r\nIf the tree (Fig. 117) is inclined in the opposite direction from which\r\nyou wish it to fall, it is sometimes possible (Fig. 117) to block up the\r\nkerf on the inclined side and then by driving the wedge over the block\r\nforce the tree to fall in the direction desired; but if the tree inclines\r\ntoo far this cannot be done.\r\n\r\nThere was a chestnut-tree standing close to my log house and leaning\r\ntoward the building. Under ordinary circumstances felling this tree would\r\ncause it to strike the house with all the weight of its trunk and\r\nbranches. When I told Siley Rosencranz I wanted that tree cut down he\r\nsighted up the tree, took a chew of tobacco, and walked away. For several\r\ndays he went through the same performance, until at last one day he\r\nbrought out his trusty axe and made the chips fly. Soon the chestnut was\r\nlying prone on the ground _pointing away_ from the house. What this old\r\nbackwoodsman did was to wait until a strong wind had sprung up, blowing in\r\nthe direction that he wanted the tree to fall, and his skilful chopping\r\nwith the aid of the wind placed the tree exactly where he wished it.\r\n\r\nFig. 118 shows how to make the cuts on a standing tree in order to remove\r\nthe bark, which is done in the same manner as that described for removing\r\nthe birch bark (Fig. 38).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nHOW TO SPLIT LOGS, MAKE SHAKES, SPLITS, OR CLAPBOARDS. HOW TO CHOP A LOG\r\nIN HALF. HOW TO FLATTEN A LOG. ALSO SOME DON'TS\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGS are usually split by the use of wedges, but it is possible to split\r\nthem by the use of two axes. Fig. 119 shows both methods. To split with\r\nthe axe, strike it smartly into the wood at the small end so as to start a\r\ncrack, then sink the axe in the crack, _A_. Next take the second axe and\r\nstrike it in line with the first one at _B_. If this is done properly it\r\nshould open the crack wide enough to release the first axe without\r\ntrouble, which may then be struck in the log at _C_. In this manner it is\r\npossible to split a straight-grained piece of timber without the use of\r\nwedges. The first axe should be struck in at the smaller or top end of the\r\nlog. To split a log with wedges, take your axe in your left hand and a\r\nclub in your right hand and, by hammering the head of your axe with the\r\nclub, drive the blade into the small end of the log far enough to make a\r\ncrack deep enough to hold the thin edge of your wedges. Make this crack\r\nall the way across the end of the log, as in Fig. 119. Put two wedges in\r\nthe end of the log, as in the diagram, and drive them until the wood\r\nbegins to split and crack along the sides of the log; then follow up this\r\ncrack with other wedges, as shown at _D_ and _E_, until the log is split\r\nin half.\r\n\r\nWhile ordinary wood splits easily enough with the grain, it is very\r\ndifficult to drive an axe through the wood at right angles to the grain,\r\nas shown by diagram to the left (Fig. 120); hence, if the amateur be\r\nchopping wood, if he will strike a slanting blow, like the one to the\r\nright in Fig. 120, he will discover that the blade of his axe will enter\r\nthe wood; whereas, in the first position, where he strikes the grain at\r\nright angles, it will only make a dent in the wood and bounce the axe\r\nback; but in striking a diagonal blow he must use care not to slant his\r\naxe too far or the blade of the axe may only scoop out a shallow chip and\r\nswing around, seriously injuring the axeman or some one else.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to cut off the limb of a tree, do not disfigure the tree\r\nby tearing the bark down; trees are becoming too scarce for us to injure\r\nthem unnecessarily; if you cut part way through the limb on the under-side\r\n(see the right-hand diagram, Fig. 121) and then cut partly through from\r\nthe top side, the limb will fall off without tearing the bark down the\r\ntrunk; but if you cut only from the top (see left-hand diagram, Fig. 121),\r\nsooner or later the weight of the limb will tear it off and make an ugly\r\nwound down the front of the tree, which in time decays, makes a hollow,\r\nand ultimately destroys the tree. A neatly cut branch, on the other hand,\r\nwhen the stub has been sheared off close to the bark, will heal up,\r\nleaving only an eye-mark on the bark to tell where the limb once grew.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to chop a log up into shorter pieces, remember to stand\r\non the log to do your chopping, as in Fig. 122. This will do away with the\r\nnecessity of rolling the log over when you want to chop on the other side.\r\nDo not forget to make the kerf, or notch, _C_, _D_ the same as _A_, _B_;\r\nin other words, the distance across the notch should equal the diameter of\r\nthe log. If you start with too narrow a kerf, or notch, before you finish\r\nyou will be compelled to widen it.\r\n\r\nFig. 119. Fig. 120. Fig. 121. Fig. 122. Fig. 123. Fig. 124. Fig.\r\n125.\r\n\r\nFig. 126. Fig. 127. Fig. 128. Fig. 129. Fig. 130. Fig. 131. Fig.\r\n131A.\r\n\r\nFig. 131B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to split a log, chop a log, flatten a log, and trim a\r\ntree.]\r\n\r\nTo flatten a log you must _score and hew_ it. Scoring consists in making a\r\nnumber of notches, _C_, _D_, _E_, _F_, _G_, _H_, _J_, etc., to the depth\r\nof the line _A_, _B_ (Figs. 123 and 124); hewing it is the act of chopping\r\noff or splitting off the pieces _A_, _C_ and _C_, _D_ and _D_, _E_, etc.,\r\nleaving the surface flat, as shown by Fig. 125, which was known among the\r\npioneers as a puncheon and with which they floored their cabins before the\r\nadvent of the saw-mill and milled lumber.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be advisable for the amateur to take a chalk-line and snap\r\nit from _A_ to _B_ (Fig. 123), so that he may be certain to have the flat\r\nsurface level. The expert axeman will do this by what he calls\r\n\"sensiation.\" It might be well to say here that if you select for\r\npuncheons wood with a straight grain and wood that will split easily you\r\nwill simplify your task, but even mean, stubborn wood may be flattened by\r\nscoring and hewing. Quoting from Horace Kephart's excellent book on\r\nwoodcraft, an experienced man can tell a straight-grained log \"by merely\r\nscanning the bark\"; if the ridges and furrows of the bark run straight up\r\nand down the wood will have a corresponding straight grain, but if they\r\nare spiral the wood will split \"waney\" or not at all. \"Waney\" is a good\r\nword, almost as good as \"sensiation\"; so when you try to quarter a log\r\nwith which to chink your cabin or log house don't select a \"waney\" log. To\r\nquarter a log split it as shown in Fig. 119 and split it along the dotted\r\nlines shown in the end view of Fig. 126.\r\n\r\nIn the Maine woods the woodsmen are adepts in making shakes, splits,\r\nclapboards, or shingles by the use of only an axe and splitting them out\r\nof the billets of wood from four to six feet long. The core of the log\r\n(Fig. 130) is first cut out and then the pieces are split out, having\r\nwedge-shaped edges, as shown by the lines marked on Fig. 127. They also\r\nsplit out boards after the manner shown by Fig. 128. In making either the\r\nboards or the shakes, if it is found that the wood splinters down into the\r\nbody of the log too far or into the board or shake too far, you must\r\ncommence at the other end of the billet or log and split it up to meet the\r\nfirst split, or take hold of the split or board with your hands and deftly\r\ntear it from the log, an art which only experience can teach. I have seen\r\ntwo-story houses composed of nothing but a framework with sides and roof\r\nshingled over with these splits. In the West they call these \"shake\"\r\ncabins.\r\n\r\nIt may be wise before we close this axeman's talk to caution the reader\r\nagainst chopping firewood by resting one end of the stick to be cut on a\r\nlog and the other end on the ground, as shown in Fig. 131, and then\r\nstriking this stick a sharp blow with the axe in the middle. The effect of\r\nthis often is to send the broken piece or fragment gyrating through the\r\nair, as is shown by the dotted lines, and many a woodchopper has lost an\r\neye from a blow inflicted by one of these flying pieces; indeed, I have\r\nhad some of my friends meet with this serious and painful accident from\r\nthe same cause, and I have seen men in the lumber fields who have been\r\nblinded in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of axes in general use among the lumbermen; but the\r\ndouble-bitted axe (131 _A_) appears to be the most popular among\r\nlumberjacks. My readers, however, are not lumberjacks but campers, and a\r\ndouble-bitted axe is a nuisance around camps. It is always dangerous and\r\neven when one blade is sunk into the tree the other blade is sticking out,\r\na menace to everybody and everything that comes near it. But the real\r\nold-fashioned reliable axe (131 _B_) is the one that is exceedingly useful\r\nin a camp, around a country place, or a farm. I even have one now in my\r\nstudio closet here in the city of New York, but I keep it more for\r\nsentiment's sake than for any real use it may be to me here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nAXEMEN'S CAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stefansson Sod Shack\r\n\r\nNOW that we know how to wield the axe we can begin on more ambitious\r\nstructures than those preceding. We may now build camps in which we use\r\nlogs instead of poles. Most of these camps are intended to be covered with\r\nsod or earth and are nearly related to the old prairie dugout. The sod\r\nhouse is used in the arctic regions because it is warm inside, and it is\r\nused in the arid regions because it is cool inside. You will note that the\r\nprinciple on which the Stefansson is constructed (Fig. 135) is practically\r\nthe same as that of the Pontiac (Fig. 36); the Stefansson frame, however,\r\nis made of larger timbers than the Pontiac because it not only must\r\nsupport a roof and side of logs and sod but must also be able to sustain\r\nany quantity of snow.\r\n\r\nFirst erect two forked upright sticks (Fig. 132), and then steady them by\r\ntwo braces. Next lay four more logs or sticks for the side-plates with\r\ntheir butt ends on the ridge-pole and their small ends on the ground as in\r\nFig. 133. Support these logs by a number of small uprights--as many as may\r\nbe necessary for the purpose. The uprights may have forks at the top or\r\nhave the top ends cut wedge-shaped to fit in notches made for that purpose\r\nin the side-plates as shown by Fig. 133 _A_. The shortest uprights at the\r\nend of the roof should be forked so that the projecting fork will tend to\r\nkeep the roof logs from sliding down. The roof is made by a number of\r\nstraight rafters placed one with the butt in front, next with the butt in\r\nthe rear alternately, so that they will fit snugly together until the\r\nwhole roof is covered. The sides are made by setting a number of sticks in\r\na trench and slanting them against the roof; both sides, front, and rear\r\nof the building should project six inches above the roof in order to hold\r\nthe sod and dirt and keep it from sliding off.\r\n\r\nFig. 132. Fig. 133. Fig. 133A Fig. 134. Fig. 135.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Stefansson sod shack.]\r\n\r\nUp in the north country one must not expect to find green, closely cropped\r\nlawns or even green fields of wild sod in all places. Although in some\r\nparts the grass grows taller than a man's head, in other places the sod is\r\nonly called so by courtesy; it really consists of scraggy grass thinly\r\ndistributed on gravelly and sandy, loose soil, and consequently we must\r\nsecure the sod by having the walls project a little above the rafters all\r\naround the building. Of course, in summer weather this roof will leak, but\r\nthen one may live in a tent; but when cold weather comes and the sod is\r\nfrozen hard and banked up with snow the Stefansson makes a good, warm\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nThe same style of a camp can be made in the temperate zone of smaller\r\ntrees and shingled with browse, or in the South of cane or bamboo and\r\nshingled with palmetto leaves, or in the Southwest of cottonwood where it\r\nmay be covered with adobe or mud. Fig. 134 shows a Stefansson shack roofed\r\nwith sod. The front is left uncovered to show its construction and also to\r\nshow how the doorway is made by simply leaving an opening like that in a\r\ntent. In winter this may have a hallway built like the one described in\r\nthe Navajo earth lodge (Fig. 35) or in the Pawnee hogan (Figs. 42 and 43),\r\nand in milder weather the doorway may be protected with a skin. An opening\r\nis left in the roof over the fireplace, which answers the purpose of a\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\nThe author aims to take hints from all the primitive dwellings which may\r\nbe of service to outdoor people; the last one described was arbitrarily\r\nnamed the Stefansson because that explorer built himself such shelters in\r\nthe far North, but he did not invent them. He borrowed the general plan\r\nfrom the natives of the northern country and adapted it to his use,\r\nthereby placing the official stamp on this shack as a useful building for\r\noutdoor people and, consequently, as deserving a place in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nRAILROAD-TIE SHACKS, BARREL SHACKS, AND CHIMEHUEVIS\r\n\r\n\r\nNO observing person has travelled far upon the American railroads without\r\nnoticing, alongside the tracks, the queer little houses built of railroad\r\nties by Italian laborers. These shacks are known by the name of dagoes\r\n(Fig. 136) and are made in different forms, according to the ingenuity of\r\nthe builder. The simplest form is the tent-shaped shown in Fig. 136, with\r\nthe ends of the ties rested together in the form of a tent and with no\r\nother support but their own weight (see the diagram to the right, Fig.\r\n136). I would not advise boys to build this style, because it might make a\r\ntrap to fall in upon them with serious results, but if they use a\r\nridge-pole like the one shown in Fig. 139 and against it rest the ties\r\nthey will do away with the danger of being caught in a deadfall trap. Of\r\ncourse, it is understood that the ridge-pole itself must first be secure.\r\n\r\nRailroad ties being flat (Fig. 137), they may be built up into solid walls\r\n(Fig. 137) and make neat sides for a little house; or they may be set up\r\non edge (Fig. 138) and secured in place by stakes driven upon each side of\r\nthem; or they may be made into the form of an open Adirondack camp (Figs.\r\n139 and 140) by resting the ties on a ridge-pole supported by a pair of\r\n\"shears\" at each end; the shears, as you will observe, consist of two\r\nsticks bound together near the top and then spread apart to receive the\r\nridge-pole in the crotch.\r\n\r\nFig. 136. Fig. 137. Fig. 138. Fig. 139. Fig. 140. Fig. 141. Fig.\r\n142. Fig. 143.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Railroad-tie shacks, barrel shack, and a Chimehuevis.]\r\n\r\nAll of these structures are usually covered with dirt and sod, and they\r\nmake very comfortable little camps.\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest a simple shelter, the \"Chimehuevis,\" is made by enclosing\r\na room in upright poles (Fig. 141) and then surrounding it with a circle\r\nof poles supporting a log or pole roof covered with sod, making a good\r\ncamp for hot weather.\r\n\r\nFig. 142 shows a barrel dugout. It is made by digging a place for it in\r\nthe bank and, after the floor is levelled off, setting rows of barrels\r\naround the foundation, filling these barrels with sand, gravel, or dirt,\r\nthen placing another row on top of the first, leaving spaces for a window\r\nand a door, after which the walls are roofed with logs and covered with\r\nsod, in the same manner as the ones previously described. The dirt is next\r\nfilled around the sides, except at the window opening, as shown by Fig.\r\n142. A barrel also does duty as a chimney.\r\n\r\nShacks like this are used by homesteaders, miners, trappers, and hunters;\r\nin fact, these people use any sort of material they have at hand. When a\r\nmining-camp is near by the freight wagons are constantly bringing in\r\nsupplies, and these supplies are done up in packages of some kind. Boards\r\nare frequently worth more a yard than silk, or were in the olden days, and\r\nso the home builders used other material. They built themselves houses of\r\ndiscarded beer bottles, of kerosene cans, of packing-boxes, of any and\r\nevery thing. Usually these houses were dugouts, as is the barrel one shown\r\nin Fig. 142. In the big-tree country they not infrequently made a house of\r\na hollow stump of a large redwood, and one stone-mason hollowed out a huge\r\nbowlder for his dwelling; but such shacks belong among the freak shelters.\r\nThe barrel one, however, being the more practical and one that can be\r\nused almost anywhere where timber is scarce but where goods are\r\ntransported in barrels, deserves a place here among our shacks, shelters,\r\nand shanties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE BARABARA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE houses along the coast of the Bering Sea are called barabaras, but the\r\nones that we are going to build now are in form almost identical with the\r\nPawnee hogan (Figs. 42 and 43), the real difference being in the peculiar\r\nlog work of the barabara in place of the teepee-like rafters of the said\r\nhogan.\r\n\r\nTo build a barabara you will need eight short posts for the outside wall\r\nand six or eight longer posts for the inside supports (Fig. 145). The\r\noutside posts should stand about three feet above the ground after they\r\nhave been planted in the holes dug for the purpose. The top of the posts\r\nshould be cut wedge-shaped, as shown by Fig. 144, in order to fit in the\r\nnotch _B_ (Fig. 144). The cross logs, where they cross each other, should\r\nbe notched like those of a log cabin (Figs. 162 and 165) or flattened at\r\nthe points of contact.\r\n\r\nPlant your first four posts for the front of your barabara in a line, two\r\nposts for the corners _B_ and _E_ (Fig. 145 _A_), and two at the middle of\r\nthe line _C_ and _D_ for door-jambs (plan, Fig. 145 _A_). The tops of\r\nthese posts should be level with each other so that if a straight log is\r\nplaced over them the log will lie level. Next plant the two side-posts _F_\r\nand _G_ (Fig. 145 _A_) at equal distances from the two front posts and\r\nmake them a few feet farther apart than are the front posts. The sketch of\r\nthe framework is drawn in very steep perspective, that is, it is made as\r\nif the spectator was on a hill looking down upon it. It is drawn in this\r\nmanner so as to better show the construction, but the location of the\r\nposts may be seen in the small plan. Next set the two back posts, _H_ and\r\n_K_, and place them much closer together, so that the bottom frame when\r\nthe rails are on the post will be very near the shape of a boy's hexagonal\r\nkite.\r\n\r\nFig. 144. Fig. 145. Fig. 145A. Fig. 146. Fig. 147. Fig. 148.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The details of a Barabara.]\r\n\r\nInside erect another set of posts, setting each one opposite the outside\r\nones and about a foot and a half or two feet farther in, or maybe less\r\ndistance, according to the material one is using. Next set some posts for\r\nthe hallway or entrance, which will be the door-jambs, and you are ready\r\nto build up the log roof. Do this by first setting the rail securely on\r\nthe two side-posts on the right and left of the building; then secure the\r\nback plate on the two back posts at the rear of the building, next resting\r\na long log over the side rails at the front of the building. The\r\ndoor-posts, of course, must be enough taller than the two end posts to\r\nallow for the thickness of the log, so that the front log will rest upon\r\ntheir top. Next put your two corner logs on, and your outside rail is\r\ncomplete. Build the inside rail in the same manner; then continue to build\r\nup with the logs as shown in the diagram until you have a frame like that\r\nin Fig. 145. Fig. 147 shows the inside of the house and the low doorway,\r\nand Fig. 148 shows the slanting walls. This frame is supposed to be\r\ncovered with splits or shakes (Figs. 147 and 148), but, as in all pioneer\r\nstructures, if shakes, splits, and clapboards are unobtainable, use the\r\nmaterial at hand--birch bark, spruce bark, tar paper, old tin roofing,\r\ntent-cloth, or sticks, brush, ferns, weeds, or round sticks, to cover it\r\nas you did with the Pawnee hogan (Figs. 42 and 43). Then cover it with\r\nbrowse, or thatch it with hay or straw and hold the thatch in place with\r\npoles or sticks, as shown in Fig. 146. The barabara may also be covered\r\nwith earth, sod, or mud.\r\n\r\nThis sort of a house, if built with planks or boards nailed securely to\r\nthe rafters and covered with earth and sod, will make a splendid cave\r\nhouse for boys and a playhouse for children on the lawn, and it may be\r\ncovered with green growing sod so as to have the appearance of an\r\nornamental mound. The instinct of the cave-dweller is deeply implanted in\r\nthe hearts of boys, and every year we have a list of fatal accidents\r\ncaused by the little fellows digging caves in sand-banks or banks of\r\ngravel which frequently fall in and bury the little troglodytes, but they\r\nwill be safe in a barabara. The shack is ventilated by a chimney hole in\r\nthe roof as shown by Fig. 146. This hole should be protected in a\r\nplayhouse. The framework is a good one to use in all parts of the country\r\nfor more or less permanent camps, but the long entrance and low doorway\r\nare unnecessary except in a cold climate or to add to the mystery of the\r\ncave house for children. It is a good form for a dugout for a root house\r\nor cyclone cellar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE NAVAJO HOGAN, HORNADAY DUGOUT, AND SOD HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIF the reader has ever built little log-cabin traps he knows just how to\r\nbuild a Navajo hogan or at least the particular Navajo hogan shown by\r\nFigs. 148 and 150. This one is six-sided and may be improved by notching\r\nthe logs (Figs. 162, 164, 165) and building them up one on top of the\r\nother, dome-shaped, to the required height. After laying some rafters for\r\nthe roof and leaving a hole for the chimney the frame is complete. In hot\r\ncountries no chimney hole is left in the roof, because the people there do\r\nnot build fires inside the house; they go indoors to keep cool and not to\r\nget warm; but the Navajo hogan also makes a good cold-country house in\r\nplaces where people really need a fire. Make the doorway by leaving an\r\nopening (Fig. 150) and chinking the logs along the opening to hold them in\r\nplace until the door-jamb is nailed or pegged to them, and then build a\r\nshed entranceway (Fig. 153), which is necessary because the slanting sides\r\nof the house with an unroofed doorway have no protection against the free\r\nentrance of dust and rain or snow, and every section of this country is\r\nsubject to visits from one of these elements. The house is covered with\r\nbrush, browse, or sod.\r\n\r\n\r\nLog Dugout\r\n\r\nFig. 152 shows how to make a log dugout by building the walls of the log\r\ncabin in a level place dug for it in the bank. Among the log cabins proper\r\n(Figs. 162 and 166) we tell how to notch the logs for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFig. 149. Fig. 150. Fig. 151. Fig. 152. Fig. 153. Fig. 154.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forms of dugouts and mound shacks.]\r\n\r\nFig. 151 shows one of these log dugouts which I have named the Hornaday\r\nfrom the fact that Doctor William Hornaday happens to be sitting in front\r\nof the one represented in the sketch. Fig. 154 shows a dugout with walls\r\nmade of sod which is piled up like stones in a stone wall. The roofs of\r\nall these are very flat and made of logs (Figs. 54, 55, and 56), often\r\nwith a log pegged to the rafters above the eaves to hold the sod. All such\r\nhouses are good in dry countries, cold countries, and countries frequented\r\nby tornadoes or by winds severe enough to blow down ordinary camps.\r\n\r\nThe Navajo hogan is an easy sort of a house for boys to build because the\r\nlads may use small poles in place of logs with which to build the camp and\r\nthus make the labor light enough to suit their undeveloped muscles, but\r\nthe next illustration shows how to build an American boy's hogan of milled\r\nlumber such as one can procure in thickly settled parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD AN AMERICAN BOY'S HOGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first time any working plans of an underground house for boys were\r\npublished was when an article by the present writer on the subject\r\nappeared in the _Ladies' Home Journal_. Afterward it was published with a\r\nlot of similar material in \"The Jack of All Trades.\" Since then other\r\nwriters have not hesitated to use the author's sketches with very little\r\nalteration; imitation is the sincerest compliment, although it is not\r\nalways fair, but it does, however, show the popularity of the\r\nunderground-house idea.\r\n\r\nThe American boy's hogan may be built like the preceding shacks of the\r\nmaterial found in the woods or it may be constructed of old boards and\r\nwaste material to be found in village back yards or on the farm, or, if\r\nthe boys have the price or if they can interest their fathers or uncles in\r\ntheir scheme, it may be built of milled lumber procured at the\r\nlumber-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrame\r\n\r\nProcure some good, sound planks and some pieces of two by four with which\r\nto build your frame. The hogan should be large enough to allow room for a\r\ntable made of a packing-case, some benches, stools, or chairs, and the\r\nceilings should be high enough for the tallest boy to stand erect without\r\nbumping his head.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurniture\r\n\r\nOne funny thing about this house is that it must be furnished before it is\r\nbuilt, because the doorway and passageway will be too small to admit any\r\nfurniture larger than a stool. Select or make your furniture and have it\r\nready, then decide upon the location of your hogan, which should be, like\r\nthe Western dugouts, on the edge of some bank (Fig. 158). In this diagram\r\nthe dotted line shows how the bank originally sloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe real hard work connected with this is the digging of the foundation;\r\none Y. M. C. A. man started to build one of these hogans, but he\r\n\"weakened\" before he had the foundation dug. He wrote the author a long\r\nletter complaining of the hard work; at the same time the author was\r\nreceiving letters from _boys_ telling how much fun they had in building\r\nand finishing their underground houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaves\r\n\r\nEver since \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Swiss Family Robinson\" were written cave\r\nhouses have been particularly attractive to boys; no doubt they were just\r\nas attractive before these books were written, and that may be the reason\r\nthe books themselves are so popular; at any rate, when the author was a\r\nsmall boy he was always searching for natural caves, or trying to dig them\r\nfor himself, and so were all of his companions. One of the most charming\r\nfeatures of the \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Huckleberry Finn\" stories is that part\r\nconnected with the cave.\r\n\r\nFig. 155. Fig. 156. Fig. 157. Fig. 157.A. Fig. 157.B. Fig. 157.C.\r\n\r\nFig. 158. Fig. 159. Fig. 160. Fig. 161.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The original American boy's hogan or underground house.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDangerous Caves\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that with caves which the boys dig for themselves there is\r\nalways serious danger of the roof falling in and smothering the young\r\ntroglodytes, but a properly built underground hogan is perfectly safe from\r\nsuch accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFraming\r\n\r\nAfter you have levelled off the foundation erect the rear posts of\r\ntwo-by-fours _A_, _B_ and _C_, _D_ (Fig. 156). These posts should be of\r\nthe same height and tall enough to allow the roof to slant toward the\r\nfront as in Fig. 155. The front posts _E_, _F_ and _G_, _H_, although\r\nshorter than the back posts, should be tall enough to allow headroom. One,\r\ntwo, or three more posts may be erected between the post _A_, _B_ and the\r\npost _C_, _D_ if additional strength is required. The same is true of the\r\nsides, and in place of having only one post in the middle of each side\r\n(_M_, _N_ and _O_, _P_, Fig. 156), there may be two or three posts, all\r\naccording to the size of the house you are building; the main point is to\r\nmake _a compact and strong box_ of your framework so that in the wet\r\nweather the banks surrounding it will not be tempted to push in the sides\r\nand spoil your house.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecaying Wood\r\n\r\nLocust, chestnut, and cedar will last longer than other varieties of wood\r\nwhen exposed to contact with damp earth, but common wood, which rots\r\neasily, may be protected by preservatives, one of which is boiled\r\nlinseed-oil with pulverized charcoal stirred into it until a black paint\r\nis produced. Some people say that a coat of charcoal paint will preserve\r\neven a basswood fence post for a lifetime, and if that is true a hogan\r\nprotected by a coating upon the outside of paint made by stirring fine\r\ncharcoal into boiled linseed-oil until it is as thick as paint will last\r\nlonger than any of my readers will have occasion to use the hogan for a\r\nplayhouse. Erect the frame (Fig. 156) by having some boys hold the\r\nuprights in place until they can be secured with temporary braces like\r\nthose shown running diagonally across from _B_ to _E_ and _A_ to _F_. You\r\nmay then proceed to board up the sides from the outside of the frame by\r\nslipping the planks between the frame and the bank and then nailing from\r\nthe inside wherever you lack room upon the outside to swing your hammer.\r\nThe door-jambs _I_, _J_ and _K_, _L_ will help support the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roof\r\n\r\nThe roof may be made of lumber, as shown by Fig. 160, or it may be made of\r\npoles like those shown on the Wyoming Olebo (Fig. 236), or it may be made\r\nof planks and covered with tar paper (Figs. 296, 297, 298, and 299), or it\r\nmay be shingled, using barrel staves for shingles, or covered with bits of\r\nold tin roofing tacked over the planking--or anything, in fact, which will\r\nkeep out the water. As for looks, that will not count because the roof is\r\nto be afterward covered with sod.\r\n\r\n\r\nCliff-House Roof\r\n\r\nIf you wish to make the roof as the cliff-dwellers made theirs, put your\r\nbiggest logs crosswise from _A_, _M_, _E_ to _C_, _O_, _G_ of your house\r\nfor rafters, and across the larger logs lay a lot of small poles as close\r\ntogether as may be, running from the back to the front of the house. Fill\r\nin the cracks between with moss or calk them with dry grass; on them\r\nplace a layer of brush, browse, or small sticks and over this a thick\r\ncoating of clay, hard-pan, or ordinary mud and pack it down hard by\r\ntramping it with your feet until it becomes a smooth and tightly packed\r\ncrust; over this you can put your sod and weeds to conceal your secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassageway\r\n\r\nTo make the frame for the underground hall or passageway (Fig. 156), first\r\nnail _Q_, _S_ across the door-jambs to form the top to the doorway, after\r\nwhich put in the supports _Q_, _R_ and _S_, _T_. Next build the frame _U_,\r\n_V_, _X_, _W_ and join it to _Q_, _S_ by the two pieces _Q_, _U_ and _S_,\r\n_V_ and put in the middle frame support marked _ZZZZ_.\r\n\r\nThe passageway should be about six feet long and the front doorway (_U_,\r\n_V_, _X_, _W_, Figs. 156 and 157) of sufficient size to enable you to\r\ncreep through with comfort. The bottom piece _W_, _X_ can be nailed to a\r\ncouple of sticks driven in the ground for that purpose. The next thing in\r\norder is the floor, and to make this firm you must lay a number of\r\ntwo-by-fours parallel to _B_, _D_ and _F_, _H_ and see that they are\r\nlevel. You will need a number of shorter pieces of the same material to\r\nrun parallel to _F_, _H_ and _W_, _X_ for the hall floor, as may be seen\r\nin Fig. 157. Across these nail your floor securely as shown in Fig. 155.\r\n\r\nThere are no windows shown in the diagram, but if the builders wish one it\r\ncan be placed immediately over the entrance or hallway in the frame marked\r\n_I_, _K_, _Q_, _S_ (Fig. 156), in which case the top covering of dirt must\r\nbe shovelled away from it to admit the light in the same manner that it is\r\nin the dugout shown in Fig. 142 and also in the small sketch (Fig. 154).\r\nThe ventilator shown in Fig. 155 may be replaced, if thought desirable, by\r\na chimney for an open fire. On account of the need of ventilation a stove\r\nwould not be the proper thing for an underground house, but an open fire\r\nwould help the ventilation. In the diagram the ventilator is set over a\r\nsquare hole in the roof; it may be made of a barrel or barrels, with the\r\nheads knocked out, placed over the hole in the roof, or kegs, according to\r\nthe size of the roof. When your house is complete fill in the dirt around\r\nthe edges, pack it down good and hard by the use of a piece of scantling\r\ntwo by four or four by four as a rammer, then cover the roof with small\r\nsticks and fine brush and sod it with growing weeds or grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Door\r\n\r\nYou should have a good, stout front door (Fig. 157) and a padlock with\r\nwhich to secure it from trespassers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAures Hinge\r\n\r\nA rustic hinge may be made by splitting a forked branch (Fig. 157 _C_) and\r\nusing the two pieces nailed to the sides of the door-jambs (Fig. 157 _A_)\r\nto hold the round ends of the rod (Fig. 157 _B_) run through them. The\r\nmiddle of the _B_ stick is flattened to fit on the surface of the door to\r\nwhich it is nailed. This hinge was invented by Scout Victor Aures of\r\nstockade 41144 of Boy Pioneers of America and a description with neat\r\ndiagrams sent by the inventor to his chief. When all is completed you can\r\nconceal the ventilator with dry brush or by planting weeds or shrubs\r\naround it, which will not interfere with the ventilation but will conceal\r\nthe suspicious-looking pipe protruding from the ground. The top of the\r\nventilator should be protected by slats, as in Fig. 161, or by wire\r\nnetting with about one-quarter-inch mesh in order to keep small animals\r\nfrom jumping or hopping down into your club-house. Of course, a few toads\r\nand frogs, field-mice and chipmunks, or even some lizards and harmless\r\nsnakes would not frighten any real boy, but at the same time they do not\r\nwant any such creatures living in the same house with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrap-Door\r\n\r\nIn place of a ventilator or chimney a trap-door may be placed in the roof\r\nand used as a secret entrance, access to inside being had by a ladder. A\r\ndescription of an appropriate ladder follows (Figs. 169 and 170).\r\n\r\nFig. 159 shows a rude way to make a chandelier, and as long as your\r\ncandles burn brightly you may know that the air in your little hogan is\r\npure and fresh. When such a chandelier is used pieces of tin should be\r\nnailed above the candles to prevent the heat from burning holes through\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nHOW TO CUT AND NOTCH LOGS\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYS you have now passed through the _grammar school_ of shack making, you\r\nare older than you were when you began, you have acquired more skill and\r\nmore muscle, and it is time to begin to handle the woodsman's axe, to\r\nhandle it skilfully and to use it as a tool with which to fashion anything\r\nfrom a table to a two-story house. None of you is too young to learn to\r\nuse the axe. General Grant, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Billy\r\nSunday--all of them could wield an axe by the time they were eight or nine\r\nyears old and do it without chopping off their toes or splitting any one\r\nelse's head open. Remember that every time you hurt yourself with an axe I\r\nhave a yellow ribbon for you to wear as a \"chump mark\"; but, joking aside,\r\nwe must now get down to serious work of preparing the logs in order to\r\nbuild us a little cabin of our own, a log club-house for our gang, or a\r\nlog camp for our troop of scouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotching Logs\r\n\r\nTo make the logs hold together at the corners of our cabins it is\r\nnecessary to lock them in some manner, and the usual way is to notch them.\r\nYou may cut flat notches like those shown in Fig. 162 and this will hold\r\nthe logs together, as shown by 162 _E_ or you may only flatten the ends,\r\nmaking the General Putnam joint shown in Fig. 163. This is called after\r\nGeneral Putnam because the log cabins at his old camp near my farm at\r\nRedding, Conn., are made in this manner. Or you may use the Pike notch\r\nwhich has a wedge-shaped cut on the lower log, as shown by Fig. 164 _J_,\r\nmade to fit into a triangular notch shown by 164 _H_. When fitted together\r\nthese logs look like the sketch marked 164 _F_ which was drawn from a\r\ncabin built in this manner.\r\n\r\nBut the simplest notch is the rounded one shown by _A_, _B_, and _C_ (Fig.\r\n165). When these are locked together they will fit like those shown at\r\nFig. 165 _D_.\r\n\r\nAway up North the people dovetail the ends of the logs (Fig. 166) so that\r\ntheir ends fit snugly together and are also securely locked by their\r\ndovetail shape. To build a log house, place the two sill logs on the\r\nground or on the foundation made for them, then two other logs across\r\nthem, as shown in Fig. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling the Logs\r\n\r\nThat the logs may be more easily handled they should be piled up on a\r\nskidway which is made by resting the top ends of a number of poles upon a\r\nbig log or some other sort of elevation and their lower ends upon the\r\nground. With this arrangement the logs may be rolled off without much\r\ntrouble as they are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nChinking\r\n\r\nA log cabin built with hardwood logs or with pitch-pine logs can seldom be\r\nmade as tight as one built with the straight spruce logs of the virgin\r\nforests. The latter will lie as close as the ones shown in Fig. 162 _E_,\r\nwhile the former, on account of their unevenness, will have large cracks\r\nbetween them like those shown in Fig. 165 _D_. These cracks may be stopped\r\nup by quartering small pieces of timber (_Y_ and _W_, Fig. 168½) and\r\nfitting these quartered pieces into the cracks between the logs where they\r\nare held by spikes. This is called \"chinking the cabin.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 162. Fig. 162E Fig. 163. Fig. 164. Fig. 164F. Fig. 165.\r\n\r\nFig. 165C. Fig. 165D. Fig. 166. Fig. 167. Fig. 168. Fig. 168½.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing how the logs are notched.]\r\n\r\nTo keep the cold and wind out, the cracks may be \"mudded\" up on the inside\r\nwith clay or ordinary lime mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nModels\r\n\r\nStudy these diagrams carefully, then sit down on the ground with a pile of\r\nlittle sticks alongside of you and a sharp jack-knife in your hand and\r\nproceed to experiment by building miniature log cabins. Really, this is\r\nthe best way to plan a large cabin if you intend to erect one. From your\r\nmodel you can see at a glance just how to divide your cabin up into rooms,\r\nwhere you want to place the fireplace, windows, and doors; and I would\r\nadvise you always to make a small model before building. Make the model\r\nabout one foot three inches long by ten inches wide, using sticks for logs\r\na little less than one inch in diameter--that is, one inch through or one\r\ninch thick. I have taken these dimensions or measurements from a little\r\nmodel that I have before me here in my studio, but, of course, you can\r\nvary them according to the plans of your cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nNOTCHED LOG LADDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nEVER since man learned to use edged tools he has made ladders or steps, or\r\nwhatever you may call them, by notching logs (Figs. 169 and 170).\r\n\r\nFig. 169. Fig. 170.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The pioneer log ladder.]\r\n\r\nA few years ago I took a splendid trip among the unnamed lakes and in what\r\nis known as \"the unexplored country\"--that is, the unmapped country of\r\nnorthwestern Quebec. We travelled over trails that had not been changed by\r\nman since canoes were invented. The forests were untouched by the axe of\r\nthe white man. There were no roads, no houses, no fences, no people except\r\na few wandering Indians, no cattle except caribou and moose, no dogs\r\nexcept wolves, and we slept at night on beds of balsam and paddled by day\r\nthrough rivers and lakes or carried our luggage and our canoes over the\r\nportages from one body of water to another over centuries-old trails. At\r\none place the trail led up the side of a mountain to the beetling face of\r\na cliff--a cliff that we had to climb with all our canoes and luggage, and\r\nwe climbed it on a couple of notched logs, as shown in Fig. 169. By the\r\nway, boys, the Indian with the big load on his back is my old friend\r\nBow-Arrow, formerly chief of the Montainais, and the load on his back was\r\nsketched from the real one he carried up that ladder portage. This old man\r\nwas then sixty years of age. But all this talk is for the purpose of\r\ntelling you the use of the notched log. Our pioneer ancestors used them to\r\nascend to the loft over their cabins where they slept (Fig. 170). It is\r\nalso a good ladder to use for tree-houses and a first-rate one for our\r\nunderground hogans when we have an entrance through the top instead of one\r\nat the side shown by Fig. 156. Since you have learned how to use the axe\r\nyou may make one of these primitive ladders to reach the hay-loft in your\r\nbarn, if you have a barn. You may make the ladder of one log if you set\r\nthe pole or log upright and notch it on both sides so that you can clasp\r\nit with your hand and, placing one foot on each side of it, climb up in\r\nthat manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nA POLE HOUSE. HOW TO USE A CROSS-CUT SAW AND A FROE\r\n\r\n\r\nPole House\r\n\r\nFIG. 171 shows a pole house--that is, a house, the walls of which are made\r\nby setting straight poles up on end with sides against each other and\r\nnailing a beam across the top (Fig. 172) and toe-nailing them (Fig. 173);\r\nthat is, driving the nails slantingly down through the poles to the sill\r\nbeneath. Fig. 172 shows how to nail them to the top beam or side-plate. To\r\nbuild a pole house, erect the four corner-posts and any intermediate posts\r\nwhich may be necessary, nailing the plates on top of the posts to hold the\r\nframe together (Fig. 172), afterward fitting the other posts in place, as\r\nshown in the sketch.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet arrived at the part of the book where we can build as\r\nextensive houses as the one shown here. The drawing is only inserted at\r\nthis place because it naturally comes with the use of the cross-cut saw.\r\nYou can, however, without much trouble, build a small pole house without\r\nthe veranda, and after you have learned how to build the big log houses\r\nyou can turn back to this page and try a pole house like Fig. 171.\r\n\r\nFig. 171. Fig. 172. Fig. 173. Fig. 174. Fig. 175. Fig. 176. Fig.\r\n177. Fig. 178. Fig. 179.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The use of the saw in log work.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSawing on an Angle\r\n\r\nFig. 174 shows how to saw off poles on the bias, as a woman would say, or\r\non an angle, as a man would say. Suppose, for instance, you want to cut\r\nthe poles to fit the dormer over the veranda shown in Fig. 171. Measure\r\noff the height of the middle pole, then the distance along the base from\r\nthe middle pole to the corner at the eaves. Next fit the poles you are\r\ngoing to use closely together to cover that distance; hold them in place\r\nby nailing a plank temporarily across the bottom ends; then place another\r\nplank at the point marked for the height of the middle pole, run it down\r\nto the bottom plank, and nail it temporarily along this line. Now take\r\nhold of one end of the saw, as the fellow does in Fig. 174, and let\r\nanother boy take the other end of the saw; then by working it back and\r\nforth along the line you may saw off the protruding ends of the poles.\r\nProceed in the same manner along the base-board. You will then have half\r\nthe dormer poles all nicely tacked together and cut in the right shape so\r\nthat they may be evenly fitted in place, and after they are secured there\r\nthe marking planks may be knocked off. Fig. 175 shows two boys at work\r\n\"pit-sawing.\" They are sawing planks from a log, which is rather hard work\r\nbut not unpleasant. I know, for I have tried it when I was up among the\r\nmoonshiners in the mountains of Kentucky. Fig. 176 is from a sketch I made\r\nup in Michigan, where two men were sawing down a tree as they frequently\r\ndo nowadays in place of chopping it down with an axe; this tree, however,\r\nwas first notched with an axe so that it would fall in the right\r\ndirection. Fig. 178 shows the peculiar teeth of one of these two-handled\r\nsaws. It is not necessary for you to be expert on the sort of teeth a saw\r\nshould have; any saw that cuts well for your purpose is the sort of saw\r\nyou need.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Froe\r\n\r\nFig. 179 shows two forms of the froe, an implement used for splitting\r\nshakes and shingles and clapboards like those on the roof of Fig. 171. The\r\nfroe is held by the handle with the left hand and hammered on the top with\r\na mallet held in the right hand. Fig. 177 shows two boys sawing a log up\r\ninto sections, but for our work in cabin building the woodsman's axe is\r\nthe real tool we need. The saw is all right and may be used if you have\r\nit, but it is a little too civilized for real woodcraft work. You cannot\r\nthrow one of these saws over your shoulder as you would an axe and go\r\nmarching into the woods with any comfort. The saw is also a more dangerous\r\nimplement around camp than even a sharp axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nLOG-ROLLING AND OTHER BUILDING STUNTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOF course my readers know all about geometry, but if by the rarest of\r\nchances one of them should not it will not prevent him from using that\r\nscience to square the corners of his log cabin. Builders always have a\r\nten-foot measuring rod--that is, a rod or straight stick ten feet long and\r\nmarked with a line at each foot from end to end. Make your own ten-foot\r\npole of as straight a piece of wood as you can find. With it measure six\r\nfeet carefully on the log _C_, _G_ (Fig. 180) and mark the point at _O_\r\n(Fig. 180); measure eight feet on the other log _C_, _A_ (Fig. 180) and\r\nmark the point at _N_. If these measurements have been carefully made from\r\n_C_ to _O_ and from _C_ to _N_ and your corner is \"square,\" then your\r\nten-foot pole will reach between the two points _O_ and _N_ with the tips\r\nof the pole exactly touching _O_ and _N_. If it does not exactly fit\r\nbetween _N_ and _O_, either the corner is not square or you have not\r\nmarked off the distances accurately on the logs. Test the measurements and\r\nif they are not found true then push your logs one way or the other until\r\nit is exactly ten feet from _O_ to _N_. Then test the corner at _H_ in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nFig. 180. Fig. 181. Fig. 182. Fig. 183.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to square the corners, roll the logs of cabin, and make\r\nlog steps.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLog-Rolling\r\n\r\nIn the olden times log-rolling was always a great frolic and brought the\r\npeople from far and near to lend a helping hand in building the new house.\r\nIn handling logs, lumbermen have tools made for that purpose--cant-hooks,\r\npeevy irons, lannigans, and numerous other implements with names as\r\npeculiar as their looks--but the old backwoodsmen and pioneers who lived\r\nin log houses owned no tools but their tomahawks, their axes, and their\r\nrifles, and the logs of most of their houses were rolled in place by the\r\nmen themselves pushing them up the skids laid against the cabin wall for\r\nthat purpose; later, when the peddlers and traders brought ropes to the\r\nsettlements, they used these to pull their logs in place. In building my\r\nlog house in Pennsylvania we used two methods; one was hand power (Fig.\r\n181). Taking two ropes we fastened the ends securely inside the cabin. We\r\nthen passed the free ends of the ropes around the log, first under it and\r\nthen over the top of it, then up to a group of men who, by pulling on the\r\nfree ends, rolled the log (Fig. 181) up to the top of the cabin. But when\r\nLafe Jeems and Nate Tanner and Jimmy Rosencranz were supplied with some\r\noxen they fastened a chain to each end of the log (Fig. 182), then\r\nfastened a pulley-block to the other side of the cabin, that is, the side\r\nopposite the skids, and ran the line through the pulley-block to the oxen\r\nas it is run to the three men in Fig. 182. When the oxen were started the\r\nlog slid up the skids to the loose rafters _N_, _O_, _P_ and when once up\r\nthere it was easily shoved and fitted into place.\r\n\r\n\r\nLog Steps\r\n\r\nSometimes one wants front steps to one's log house and these may be made\r\nof flattened logs or puncheons, as shown by Fig. 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE ADIRONDACK OPEN LOG CAMP AND A ONE-ROOM CABIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAdirondack Log Camp\r\n\r\nNOT satisfied with the open brush Adirondack camp, the men in those woods\r\noften build such camps of logs with a puncheon floor and a roof of real\r\nshingles. The sketch (Fig. 184) is made from such a camp. At the rear the\r\nlogs are notched and placed like those of a log house (Figs. 162, 163,\r\n164, 166), but the front ends of the side logs are toe-nailed (Fig. 173)\r\nto the two upright supports. In this particular camp the logs are also\r\nflattened on the inside in order to give a smoother finish, as they often\r\nare in old Virginia and Kentucky log houses. In Virginia they formerly\r\nhewed the logs flat with broad axes after the walls were up, but that\r\nrequired a workman of a different type than the ordinary woodsman. The\r\nbroadaxe is seldom used now and may be omitted from our kit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCabin Plan\r\n\r\nA one-room log cabin with double bunks at one end makes a good camp (Fig.\r\n185) with room for two or four sleepers according to the width of the bunk\r\n(Fig. 186).\r\n\r\nFig. 184. Fig. 185. Fig. 186.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lean-to and one-pen cabin plan.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bunks\r\n\r\nThe bunks are made by setting the ends of two poles into holes in the logs\r\nbored for that purpose (Fig. 185) and nailing slats across the poles. Over\r\nthis a bed of browse is laid and on this blankets are spread and all is\r\nthen ready for bedtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHLAND TILT AND INDIAN LOG TENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLog Tents\r\n\r\nSOME years ago in the north country the Indians built themselves log tents\r\nlike the one shown in Fig. 187. These were the winter houses in the north\r\ncountry. A ridge-pole was set up on two forked sticks and the logs slanted\r\nup against each other and rested upon that pole. Smaller poles were then\r\nlaid up against this frame, both front and rear, all of which could then\r\nbe covered with sod or browse and made into a warm winter house. My boy\r\nreaders may build a similar house by using small poles instead of big\r\nlogs, or they may make a \"northland tilt\" (Fig. 189), which is a\r\nmodification of the Indian's log tent and has two side-plates (Fig. 188)\r\ninstead of one ridge-pole. The log chimney is also added, and when this is\r\nconnected with a generous fireplace the fire will brighten and warm the\r\ninterior of the tilt and make things comfortable. The chimney may be made\r\nby first building a fireplace of sod or stone, as shown in Figs. 269 and\r\n270, on top of which a chimney can be erected in the same manner that you\r\nbuild a log house.\r\n\r\nFig. 187. Fig. 188. Fig. 189.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Log tilts of the North.]\r\n\r\nThe front of the northland tilt is faced in with small logs set on end, as\r\nshown in the unfinished one (Fig. 189); this makes a substantial, warm\r\nwinter camp. If the logs fit close together on the roof they may be calked\r\nwith moss and dry grass. If the cracks are too wide on account of the\r\nunevenness of the log, cover them first with grass, fine brush, or browse\r\nand over all place a coating of sod or mud and you will have a house fit\r\nfor a king to live in. To tell the truth, it is much too good for a mere\r\nking and almost good enough for a real American boy--that is, if anything\r\nis good enough for such a lad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD THE RED JACKET, THE NEW BRUNSWICK, AND THE CHRISTOPHER GIST\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"Red Jacket\" is another camp; but this, you see, has straight walls,\r\nmarking it as _a white man's camp_ in form not apparently borrowed from\r\nthe red men. It is, however, a good, comfortable, rough camp and Figs. 190\r\nand 191 show how it was evolved or grew. To build the Red Jacket one will\r\nfirst have to know how to build the more simple forms which we call the\r\nNew Brunswick, then the next step will be the Christopher Gist, and last\r\nthe Red Jacket. We will now begin with the New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Brunswick\r\n\r\nBy referring to Fig. 190 you will see that it is practically a deep,\r\nAdirondack, open-face camp with a wind-shield built in front of it. To\r\nbuild this camp, make the plan about six feet by twelve on the ground; of\r\ncourse the back logs must be something over six feet long to allow for six\r\nfeet in the clear. Notch about four or five back logs with the plain,\r\nrounded notch already described and illustrated by Fig. 165. Then lay the\r\nside sill logs and erect two upright forked sticks for the front of your\r\ncabin to hold the cross stick which supports the roof rafter. Now build up\r\nyour cabin as you would a log house, notching only the small ends of the\r\nside logs and saving the larger ends for the front; between each of these\r\nchink with other logs shaped to fit the spaces or with pieces of other\r\nlogs so as to make the front higher than the rear. When the logs meet the\r\nrafter pole all the cracks are chinked up with small pieces of wood and\r\nthe crevices calked with moss. Then the roof of bark is put on, shingled\r\nas described for the Pontiac, and illustrated by Figs. 36 and 190 _A_. The\r\nbark is kept in place by laying sticks or poles over it to weight it down,\r\nas may be seen by the plan of the roof (Fig. 190 _A_), which is supposed\r\nto be the way the unfinished roof would look to you if you were looking\r\ndown upon it from the branch of a tree or an aeroplane. After you have\r\nyour open-faced camp finished take some green logs from the fir-trees if\r\nthey are handy and split them in half by one of the methods shown by Fig.\r\n119. Then leaving enough room for a passageway, erect your wind-shield of\r\ngreen logs, resting them against a pole laid between two forked sticks. Be\r\nsure you have the green, split side of the log facing the camp and the\r\nbark side facing outdoors, because the green wood will not burn readily;\r\nand as the camp-fire is built close to the wind-shield, if the shield is\r\nmade of very inflammable material it will soon burn down. Some woods, you\r\nknow, burn well when green and some woods must be made dry before we can\r\nuse them for fuel; but the wood we want for the fire-shield is the sort\r\nthat will not burn readily; the good-burning woods we save to use in our\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Gist\r\n\r\nThe next camp is the Christopher Gist, named after George Washington's\r\ncamping friend. This camp, as you may see by Fig. 191, is built like a New\r\nBrunswick except that the side sill logs are much longer as is also the\r\nlog which extends over the doorway. Then, in place of having a wind-shield\r\nbuilt by itself, the wind-shield in Fig. 191 is the other end of the cabin\r\nbuilt just the same as the rear end, but it should be built of peeled logs\r\nas they are less liable to catch afire than the ones with the bark upon\r\nthem. If you feel real lazy it will only be necessary to peel the bark off\r\nfrom the inside half of the log. Above the door at the end of the roof of\r\nthe Adirondack camp part of the space is filled by logs running across,\r\nwith the lower one resting upon the top of the door-jamb; this closes the\r\nshed above the wind-shield and leaves a little open yard in front wherein\r\nto build your camp-fire.\r\n\r\nFig. 190. Fig. 190A. Fig. 191. Fig. 192.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The stages in the evolution of a log cabin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Jacket\r\n\r\nThe Red Jacket continues the suggestion offered by the Christopher Gist\r\nand extends the side walls all the way across to the wind-shield, and the\r\nlatter now becomes the true end of the log shack. The side walls and end\r\nwall are built up from the top of the shack to form a big, wide log\r\nchimney under which the open camp-fire is built on the ground. The Red\r\nJacket is roofed with bark in the same manner as the New Brunswick and\r\nChristopher Gist and occupies the important position of the missing link\r\nbetween the true log cabin or log house and the rude log camp of the\r\nhunter. If you will look at Fig. 184, the open-faced log camp; then Fig.\r\n190, the camp with the wind-shield in front of it; then Fig. 191 with the\r\nwind-shield enclosed but still open at the top; then 192 where the\r\nwind-shield has turned into a fireplace with a chimney; then Figs. 271 and\r\n273, showing the ends of the real log cabin, you will have all the steps\r\nin the growth or evolution which has produced the American log house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nCABIN DOORS AND DOOR-LATCHES, THUMB-LATCHES AND FOOT LATCHES AND HOW TO\r\nMAKE THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nPERHAPS my reader has noticed that, although many of the descriptions of\r\nhow to build the shacks, shanties, shelters, camps, sheds, tilts, and so\r\nforth are given with somewhat minute details, little or nothing has been\r\nsaid regarding the doors and door-latches. Of course we have no doors on\r\nthe open Adirondack camp, but we have passed the open camps now and are\r\nwell into cabin work, and all cabins have some sort of a door. All doors\r\nhave, or should have, some sort of a door-latch, so the doors and\r\ndoor-latches have been saved for this place in the book, where they are\r\nsandwiched between the log cabin and the log houses proper, which is\r\nprobably the best place for them. The \"gummers\" who collect spruce gum in\r\nthe north woods and the trappers and all of the hermit class of woodsmen\r\nfrequently come home to their little shack with their hands full of traps\r\nor with game on their shoulders, and consequently they want to have a door\r\nwhich may be opened without the necessity of dropping their load, and so\r\nthey use a foot latch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoot Latch\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest of the foot latches consists of a piece of wood cut\r\nout by the aid of axe and hunting-knife to the form shown by Fig. 199; a\r\nhole in the door cut for that purpose admits the flattened and notched\r\nend and upon the inside it fits the round log sill. The owner of the\r\nshack, when reaching home, steps upon the foot latch (Fig. 199), which\r\nlifts up the catch (on the inside) and allows the door to swing open.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrigger Latch\r\n\r\nFig. 200 shows a more complicated form of latch with a trigger protruding\r\nfrom the lower part of the door, which is hinged to a wooden shaft, and\r\nthe shaft in turn is connected with the latch. The fastenings of the\r\ntrigger to the shaft and the shaft to the latch are made with hardwood\r\npegs or wire nails which move freely in their sockets. The latch is the\r\nsimplest form of a wooden bar fastened at one end with a screw or nail on\r\nwhich it can move up and down freely; the other end is allowed to drop\r\ninto the catch. The latch itself is similar to the one shown in Figs. 193\r\nand 194. The trigger is also fastened to a block on the outside of the\r\ndoor by a nail or peg upon which it moves freely, so that when the weight\r\nof the foot is placed upon the trigger outside the door that end is forced\r\ndown which pushed the end attached to the shaft up; this pushes the shaft\r\nup and the shaft pushes _the latch up_; thus the door is unfastened. The\r\ndiagram to the left in Fig. 200 shows the edge of the door with the\r\ntrigger on the outside, the shaft upon the inside. The diagram to the\r\nright in Fig. 200 shows the inside of the door, the end of the trigger,\r\nthe shaft, the latch, and the catch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Latch-String\r\n\r\nIn the preceding locks and fastenings, no matter how generous and\r\nhospitable the owner may be, his latch-string never \"hangs on the\r\noutside,\" but in this one the latch-string literally hangs outside and any\r\none may enter by pulling it (Figs. 193 and 194). But when the owner is in\r\nand does not want to be interrupted he pulls the string in, which tells\r\nthe outsider that he must knock before he can be admitted. This simplest\r\nform of latch has been here put upon the simplest form of a door, a door\r\nwith a wooden hinge made by nailing a round rod to the edge of the door\r\nand allowing the ends of the rod to project above and below the door. In\r\nthe sill log below the door a hole about two inches deep is bored to\r\nreceive the short end of the hinge rod; above a deeper hole is bored to\r\nreceive the long end of the hinge rod. To hang the door run the long end\r\nup in the top hole far enough to lift the door sufficiently to be able to\r\ndrop the lower end of the hinge rod in the lower hole. Your door is then\r\nhung and may swing back and forth at your pleasure. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that such a door admits plenty of cold air, it is a very popular door\r\nfor camps and is even used for log houses.\r\n\r\nFig. 193. Fig. 194. Fig. 195. Fig. 196. Fig. 197. Fig. 198.\r\n\r\nFig. 199. Fig. 200.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foot and thumb door-latches.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple Spring-Latch\r\n\r\nA simple form of spring-latch is shown by Fig. 196, as you may see, _A_ is\r\na peg driven into the door-jamb. It has a notch in it's outer end so that\r\n_B_, a piece of hickory, may be sprung into the notch; _B_ is fastened to\r\nthe door by a couple of screws. By pushing the door the latch will slide\r\nout of the rounded notch and the door opens. When you pull the door to\r\nclose it the end of the spring strikes the rounded end of the _A_ peg and,\r\nsliding over it, drops naturally into the slot and holds the door closed.\r\nThis form of latch is also a good one for gates.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter Spring-Latch\r\n\r\nFigs. 197 and 198 show more complicated spring-latches but this latch is\r\nnot so difficult to make as it may appear in the diagram. _A_ and _D_\r\n(197) show, respectively, the wooden catch and the guard confining the\r\nlatch. _C_ is another guard made, as you may observe, from a twig with a\r\nbranch upon it; the twig is split in half and fastened at the base with\r\ntwo screws, and at the upper end, where the branch is bent down, is\r\nfastened with one screw. A guard like the one shown by _D_ (Fig. 197)\r\nwould answer the purpose, but I am taking the latch as it was made. The\r\nlower diagram (Fig. 198) shows a side view of the edge of the door with\r\ntwo cotton spools fastened at each end of the stick which runs through a\r\nslot in the door. _E_ is the cotton spool on the outside of the door and\r\n_F_ the cotton spool on the inside of the door. The upper left-hand\r\ndiagram (Fig. 198) shows the slot in the door and the spool as it appears\r\nfrom the outside. _B_ (Fig. 197) is the spring-latch which is held in\r\nplace by the spool _F_. The stick or peg which runs through the spools and\r\nthe slot also runs through a hole made for that purpose in the\r\nspring-latch, as shown at _F_ (Fig. 197). After the stick with the _E_\r\nspool on it has been run through the slot from the outside of the door,\r\nthence through the spring-latch _B_ and into the spool _F_, it is fastened\r\nthere by driving around its end some thin wedges of wood or by allowing it\r\nto protrude and running a small peg through the protruding end, as shown\r\nby _F_, _G_ (Fig. 197, lower diagram). The thin, springy end of your latch\r\nis now forced down by a peg or nail in the door at _H_ (Fig. 197) and the\r\ntail end of it forced up by a peg or nail at _K_. When this is done\r\nproperly it will give considerable spring to the latch and impart a\r\ndecided tendency to force the latch into the wooden catch, a tendency\r\nwhich can only be overcome by lifting the spool up in the slot and thus\r\nlifting the latch and allowing the door to open. Fig. 197 shows the inside\r\nof the door with the spring-latch, catches and all complete; it also gives\r\ndetails of the wooden catch _A_ with guards _D_ and _C_ and the fastening\r\nof the stick in the spool by a peg driven through the end of the stick at\r\n_F_, _G_. This last one is a good jack-knife latch to make for your camp\r\nor cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nSECRET LOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET locks are more useful than strong ones for a country house which is\r\nleft alone during the winter months, for it is not so much cupidity which\r\ncauses such houses to be broken into as it is the curiosity of the native\r\nboys. But while these lads often do not hesitate to force or pick a lock\r\nthey will seldom go as far as to smash a door to effect an entrance;\r\nhence, if your lock is concealed your house is safe from all but\r\nprofessional thieves, and such gentry seldom waste their time to break\r\nopen a shack which contains nothing of value to them. The latches shown by\r\nFigs. 193, 200, and 201 may be made very heavy and strong, and if the\r\ntrigger in Fig. 200, the latch-string hole in Fig. 193, and the peg hole\r\nin Fig. 201 are adroitly concealed they make the safest and most secure\r\nlocks for summer camps, shacks, and houses.\r\n\r\nIf a large bar (Fig. 201½ _B_) be made of one-by-four-inch plank, bolted\r\nin the middle of the plank with an iron bolt through the centre of the\r\ndoor and fastened on the inside by a nut screwed on to the bolt it will\r\nallow the bar to revolve freely on the inside of the door and bar the door\r\nwhen resting in the _A_ and _C_ catches. But if a string is attached to\r\none end it may be unfastened by pulling the string up through the gimlet\r\nhole in the door.\r\n\r\nTo conceal this lock, draw the string through the gimlet hole and fasten a\r\nnail on the string. When it is undrawn the door bar is horizontal and the\r\ndoor consequently barred. Then push the nail in the gimlet hole so that\r\nonly the head appears on the outside and no one not in the secret will\r\never suppose that the innocent-appearing nail is the key to unfasten the\r\ndoor. When you wish to open the door from the outside, pluck out the nail,\r\npull the string, and walk in.\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand other simple contrivances which will suggest\r\nthemselves to the camper, and he can find entertainment for rainy days in\r\nplanning and enlarging on the ideas here given. In the real wilderness,\r\nhowever, every camp is open to all comers--that is, the latch-string hangs\r\noutside the door, but the real woodsmen respect the hospitality of the\r\nabsent owner and replace whatever food they may use with fresh material\r\nfrom their own packs, wash all dishes they may use, and sweep up and leave\r\nthe shack in \"apple-pie\" order after their uninvited visit, for this is\r\nthe law of the wilderness which even horse thieves and bandits respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tippecanoe\r\n\r\nThe Tippecanoe latch is worked with a wooden spring and when properly\r\nmade, of well-seasoned wood, will probably outlast a metal one, for wood\r\nwill not rust and cannot rot unless subjected to moisture.\r\n\r\nThe position of the spring in Fig. 201 shows the latch with the bolt\r\nsprung back. The fact that the bolt-hole in the catch is empty also tells\r\nthe same story. The drawing of the outside of the door (Fig. 203) shows by\r\nthe position of the peg that the door is fastened. To open the door, push\r\nback the bolt by sliding the peg to the opposite end of the slot. From a\r\nview of the edge of the door (Fig. 202) one may see how the peg protrudes\r\non the outside of the door.\r\n\r\nFig. 201. Fig. 201½. Fig. 202. Fig. 203.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tippecanoe. A jack door-latch.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Tippecanoe latch is made of quite a number of parts, it is\r\nreally a very simple device, but in order to display the simplicity of its\r\nconstruction to the ambitious jack-knife latch maker I have drawn all the\r\nparts but the spring stick natural size (Figs. 204 to 207), but since the\r\noriginal diagram is drawn too large for this page and was reduced by the\r\nengraver there is a scale of inches at the bottom to give the reader the\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThere are no fixed dimensions for this or any other lock, latch, or catch,\r\nbut the proportions here given are probably the ones that will fit your\r\ndoor. The foundation block is shown by Fig. 204. Upon this the latch rests\r\nand is securely nailed or screwed to the door. Figs. 205 and 206 are two\r\nwooden clamps which are fastened to the door and also to the foundation\r\nblock (Fig. 204). These clamps must be notched as in the diagrams to allow\r\nfor the movement of the bolt, but since the bolt (Fig. 207) is larger and\r\nthicker at the butt the notch in Fig. 205 is made just a trifle larger\r\nthan the butt end of the bolt and in Fig. 206 the notch is made a trifle\r\nsmaller than the opposite end of the bolt. The object of the offset on the\r\nbolt (Fig. 207) forward of the peg is to make a shoulder to stop it from\r\nshooting too far when the spring is loosened.\r\n\r\nFig. 204. Fig. 204½. Fig. 205. Fig. 206. Fig. 207.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail parts of Tippecanoe door-latch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catch\r\n\r\nFigs. 201 and 204½ show the catch which is to be securely fastened to the\r\ndoor-jamb. The spring, of course, must be made of well-seasoned, elastic\r\nwood. Hickory is the best. This stick may be quite long, say half again as\r\nlong in proportion as the one shown in Fig. 201. It must be flattened at\r\nthe upper end and secured by two nails and it must be flattened at right\r\nangles to the upper part and somewhat pointed at the lower end so as to\r\nfit in a notch in the bolt (Fig. 201). A well-made lock of this sort is a\r\nsource of constant joy and pride to the maker and he will never tire of\r\nspringing it back and forth and extolling its virtues to his guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE THE BOW-ARROW CABIN DOOR AND LATCH AND THE DEMING TWIN BOLTS,\r\nHALL, AND BILLY\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 209 shows the inside of the door with the wooden latch in place. You\r\nmay use planks from the sawmill for the door in place of splitting them\r\nfrom spruce logs, as the ones here are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe battens (_A_, _B_, _C_) are made of birch, but you may use any\r\nmaterial at hand for them. The hinges (Figs. _E_, 211 _D_, 210) are made\r\nof birch sticks whittled off at the top so as to leave a peg (Fig. _E_,\r\n211) to work in a hole in the flattened end of the horizontal battens (_A_\r\nand _C_, Fig. 209).\r\n\r\nThe batten _B_ is in two pieces. The top piece serves as a brace for the\r\nspring (Fig. _G_, 209) and the bottom piece as a support for the bolt\r\n(Fig. _H_, 209 and 212). The battens may be made of a piece of board. The\r\nbolt (Fig. _H_, 212) works free upon a nail in the left-hand end and rests\r\nin the catch (Fig. _K_, 215) on the door-jamb.\r\n\r\nThe guard (Fig. _J_, 216) fits over the bolt and keeps it in place. The\r\nnotch in the guard must be long enough to give the bolt free play up and\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe spring (Fig. _G_, 209) is fastened with a nail to the door in such a\r\nmanner that its thin end rests upon the top of the bolt with sufficient\r\nforce to bend the spring and hold the bolt down in the catch (Fig. _K_,\r\n215).\r\n\r\nThe thumb-latch (Fig. _L_, 213) is whittled out in the form shown, and\r\nfastened in a slot cut in the door by a nail driven through the edge of\r\nthe door (Fig. _M_, 213) and through a hole in the thumb-latch (Fig. _L_,\r\n213). On this nail the latch works up and down.\r\n\r\nFig. 217 shows the outside of the door and you can see that by pressing\r\ndown the thumb-latch on the outside it will lift it up on the inside, and\r\nwith it the bolt lifts up the free end of the latch and thus unfastens the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe handle (Figs. 217 and 214 _N_) is used in place of a door-knob. It is\r\nmade of yellow birch bent in hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deming Twin Lock\r\n\r\nE. W. Deming, the painter of Indian pictures, the mighty hunter, and\r\nfellow member of the Camp-Fire Club of America, is a great woodsman. Not\r\nonly is he a great woodsman but he is the father of _twins_, and so we\r\nhave thought that he possesses all the characteristics necessary to\r\nentitle him to a place in this book, and after him and his twins we have\r\nnamed the twin bolts shown by Fig. 208.\r\n\r\nThe lower or Hall bolt is shot into a hole in the door-sill, and the upper\r\nor Billy bolt is shot into a hole in the door-jamb above the door. The\r\nholes should be protected upon the surface of the wood by pieces of tin or\r\nsheet iron with holes cut in them to admit the bolt. The tins may be\r\ntacked over the bolt-hole in the sill for the Hall bolt and on the\r\nbolt-hole overhead for the Billy bolt, and it will prevent the splitting\r\naway of the wood around the holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuards\r\n\r\nTwo guards, _A_ and _B_ (Fig. 208), made as in Fig. 216, protect the bolts\r\nand act as guides to keep them from swinging out of position; two springs\r\n_C_ and _D_ (Fig. 208), made of well-seasoned hickory and attached to the\r\nbattens on the door by nails or screws, force the bolts down and up into\r\nthe bolt-holes (Fig. 208). To release the bolts, the spring must be drawn\r\nback as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 208. This may be done by means\r\nof a string or picture wire, which is fastened in the ends of the bolts\r\nand runs through a hole in the ends of the spring and is attached to the\r\nlever _E_ (Fig. 208). When the end of this lever is pushed down into the\r\nposition shown by the dotted line and arrow-point, it lifts up the Hall\r\nbolt at the bottom of the door and pulls down the Billy bolt overhead,\r\nthus unfastening the door.\r\n\r\nFig. 208. Fig. 209. Fig. 210. Fig. 211. Fig. 212. Fig. 213.\r\n\r\nFig. 214. Fig. 215. Fig. 216. Fig. 217.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jack-knife latches suitable for Canada and America.]\r\n\r\nBut, of course, if one is outside the door one cannot reach the lever _E_;\r\nso, to overcome this difficulty, a hole is bored through the central\r\nbatten of the door and the latch-string is tied to the top end of the\r\nlever and the other end is run through the hole bored in the door (Fig.\r\n208).\r\n\r\nThe end outside of the door is then tied to a nail; by pulling the nail\r\nyou pull down the lever _E_, which undoes the bolts and opens the door.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to leave the door locked, after it is closed, push the\r\nnail into the latch-string hole so that only the head will be visible from\r\nthe outside. When the nail and string are arranged in this manner, a\r\nstranger will see no means of opening the door, and, as there are many\r\nnail-heads in all rough doors, the one to which the latch-string is\r\nattached will not attract the attention of any one who is unacquainted\r\nwith the Deming twin bolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nTHE AURES LOCK LATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Aures lock differs from the preceding ones in the use of metal\r\nsprings, but wooden ones may be substituted; for instance, a wooden spring\r\nlike the one in Fig. 209 may be put under the bolt or latch shown in Fig.\r\n219, which is practically the same latch; that is, if you turn the latch\r\nin Fig. 209 upside down it will make the latch shown in Fig. 219; also, if\r\nyou take the bolt or lock _B_ in Fig. 219 and make it of one piece of wood\r\nwith a spring to it, like the one shown in Fig. 208 or Fig. 209, or make\r\nit exactly like the one shown in Fig. 201, the Aures lock can be made\r\naltogether of wood. But with this lock, as described below, metal springs\r\nwere used (Figs. 219, 220, and 221).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Door\r\n\r\nThe door shows the two strings _H_ and _K_ coming through gimlet holes\r\nnear the top. Fig. 218 represents the outside of the door. The strings may\r\nbe concealed by covering their ends with a board as shown in this diagram,\r\nbut even if they are not concealed, one unacquainted with the lock will\r\nnot know how to work them in order to open the door.\r\n\r\n_A_ in Figs. 219, 220, and 221 is the latch which is made of a piece of\r\nwood about eight or nine inches long by about one and one half inches wide\r\nby an inch or three quarters of an inch thick. A hole is drilled near the\r\ncentre of the latch and a screw placed through which is screwed into the\r\ndoor so that the latch will extend about two or three inches beyond the\r\nend of the door.\r\n\r\n_D_ (Figs. 219, 220, and 221) is a catch or stop which is fastened to the\r\ndoor-jamb and keeps the end of the latch from flying too far up to lock\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n_B_ (Fig. 219) is the key which is made of the same sort of wood as the\r\nlatch; a hole is drilled in this also but it is here placed about one inch\r\nfrom the top. A screw is run through this, as in the hole in the latch,\r\nand screwed into the door (Fig. 219).\r\n\r\nFig. _C_, 219 is a small block of wood on which a steel-band spring has\r\nbeen screwed to keep the key in its proper place. The block is screwed to\r\nthe door a short distance above the top of the key.\r\n\r\nFig. _J_, 219 is a nail or peg placed in the door close beside the key\r\nwhen the key is vertical; this is intended to prevent the key from being\r\nshoved over too far by the force of the band spring _F_.\r\n\r\nFig. 219 _L_ is a steel wire spring (a window-shade spring will answer the\r\npurpose), fastened to the door at one end and to the latch at the other\r\nend, and serves to keep the latch down and in place when locked.\r\n\r\nFig. 219 _K_ is the latch-string, one end of which is fastened to one end\r\nof the latch and the other end run through a hole near the top of the door\r\nand extending outside the same as the latch-string (Fig. 218).\r\n\r\nFig. 219 shows the positions of the latch and key when the latch is\r\nlocked; to open the lock from the outside it is necessary to pull the key\r\nstring first (_H_, Fig. 220), which releases the key; then pull the\r\nlatch-string, thus lifting the latch while still holding the key string.\r\nThe key string is now let go; the spring forcing the key into the position\r\nshown in Fig. 221 will keep the door unlocked.\r\n\r\nWhen leaving the room, all that is necessary is to pull the key string\r\nwhich lifts the key, then let go the latch-string, and the latch will\r\nspring back to its locked position and the key will also fly back into its\r\nposition as in Fig. 219. Any one not knowing the combination will be\r\nunable to open the door.\r\n\r\nFig. 218. Fig. 219. Fig. 220. Fig. 221. Fig. 222. Fig. 223.\r\n\r\nFig. 224. Fig. 225. Fig. 226. Fig. 227. Fig. 228.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-made cabin door-locks.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Compass Lock\r\n\r\nThis lock is made on the same principle as the combination safe lock, but\r\nit is a lock any bright boy can make for himself. In the first place,\r\ninstead of numbers, use compass divisions; that is, use a disk with the\r\npoints of the compass scratched on it and an ordinary door-knob with an\r\nindex mark filed on its base, as shown by Fig. 224 where the finger is\r\npointing.\r\n\r\nHunt up three old door-knobs like those shown in Figs. 222, 224, and 225.\r\nWhen you take one of the door-knobs off one end of the shaft you will find\r\nseveral small screw holes in the steel shaft (Fig. 222). Over this end you\r\nset a block of hardwood which you fashion out of a square block (Fig. 223)\r\nby first cutting off the corners as shown by the dotted lines, then\r\nwhittling the angles off until it becomes rounded like a compass face;\r\nafter which saw off an arc, that is, part of a circle, as shown in Figs.\r\n224, 226, and 227. Next make a square hole through the centre of the\r\ncircle to fit the square end of the steel shaft of the door-knob. The\r\nsquare hole is not the centre of the block as it is now cut, but it is the\r\ncentre of the block as it was when it was round; that is, the centre of\r\nthe circle. Insert the square end of the steel shaft into the square hole\r\nin the block, and, through a hole carefully drilled for the purpose, put a\r\nscrew down through the hole in the end of the steel shaft (Fig. 224); this\r\nwill firmly fix the block on the end of the knob. Of course, the knob must\r\nbe inserted through the door before the block is permanently fastened\r\nupon the end of the shaft. Fig. 225 shows the edge of the door with the\r\nthree knobs in place. If these knobs are so turned (Fig. 226) that their\r\nflat edges are parallel with the crack of the door, there is nothing to\r\nprevent you from opening the door; but if the knobs are so turned (Fig.\r\n227) that the blocks overlap the crack of the door, the door cannot be\r\nopened without breaking the lock.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we must have some sort of a mark to tell us how to make\r\nthe proper combination so that the door may be opened. To do this, take\r\nthe metal washer of the door-knob (the upper figure in Fig. 228) or a\r\ncircular piece or disk of tin and divide it up like a compass (Fig. 228).\r\nFasten these disks securely on to the door with nails or screws; place all\r\nof the disks with the north point pointing to the top of the door and in\r\nline with each other. File in the circular base of each door-knob (Fig.\r\n224) a little notch at the black mark where the finger is pointing, then\r\nput the door-knobs in place and fasten them there (Fig. 225) by screwing\r\nthe block on their ends (Fig. 224) and securing the screws in the blocks\r\nby running them through the shaft. Carefully turn the knobs so that the\r\nblock on the inside fits like those shown in Fig. 226. Jot down in your\r\nnotebook the position of the index on each knob (finger point, 224); one\r\nmay read northeast, another may read southwest, and another may read\r\nsouth. When one wants to open the door one must turn the knobs so that\r\nthey will read according to the notes and the door may be opened; but\r\nunless the indexes read as noted some of them will be turned as in Fig.\r\n227, locking the door, and it may not be opened.\r\n\r\nWhen the door is closed, twist the knobs around and it will lock them so\r\nthat no one else can open the door unless they know the combination. The\r\nfact that there _is_ a combination will not be suggested to a stranger by\r\nthe compasses, although it might be suggested if there were figures in\r\nplace of compass points. But even supposing they did suspect a combination\r\nit would take a long time for them to work it out, and no one would do it\r\nbut a thief. A burglar, however, would not take the time; he would pry\r\nopen the door with his \"jimmy\" and, as I have said before, these locks are\r\nfor the purpose of keeping out tramps, vagrants, and inquisitive boys.\r\n\r\nWe have no locks yet invented which will keep out a real, professional\r\nburglar if he has reason to suppose there are valuables inside.\r\n\r\nThe safety of your log cabin depends principally upon the fact that\r\nvaluables are not kept in such shacks, and real burglars know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN LOG CABIN\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW that we know how to make doors and door-latches, locks, bolts, and\r\nbars, we may busy ourselves with building an American log cabin. It is all\r\nwell enough to build our shacks and shanties and camps of logs with the\r\nbark on them, but, when one wishes to build a log cabin, one wants a house\r\nthat will last. Abraham Lincoln's log cabin is still in existence, but it\r\nwas built of logs with no bark on them. There is a two-story log house\r\nstill standing in Dayton, O.; it is said to have been built before the\r\ntown was there; but there is no bark on the logs. Bark holds moisture and\r\nmoisture creates decay by inviting fibrous and threadlike cousins of the\r\ntoadstool to grow on the damp wood and work their way into its substance.\r\nThe bark also shelters all sorts of boring insects and the boring insects\r\nmake holes through the logs which admit the rain and in the end cause\r\ndecay, so that the first thing to remember is to peel the logs of which\r\nyou propose to build the cabin. There is now, or was lately, a log cabin\r\non Hempstead Plains, L. I., near the road leading from Mineola to\r\nManhassett; it is supposed to have been built when the first white\r\nsettlers began to arrive on Long Island, but this was what was known as a\r\n\"blockhouse,\" a small fort. In 1906 Mr. I. P. Sapington said: \"I think\r\nthat I am the only man now living who helped build General Grant's log\r\ncabin.\" Grant's house was what is popularly known in the South as a\r\n\"saddle-bag\" log house, or, as the old Southwestern settlers called it, a\r\n\"two-pen,\" the pens being two enclosures with a wide passageway or gallery\r\nbetween them, one roof extending over both pens and the gallery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was not afraid of work, and, like a good scout, was always\r\nwilling to help a neighbor. He had a team of big horses, a gray and a bay,\r\nand the loads of cord-wood he hauled to St. Louis were so big that they\r\nare still talked of by the old settlers. In the summer of 1854 Grant\r\nstarted his log cabin, and all his neighbors turned in to help him build\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Log House\r\n\r\nThe American log house differs from the Canadian log house principally in\r\nthe shape of the roof. Our old settlers made steep gambrel roofs to shed\r\nthe rain.\r\n\r\n    \"Gambrel! Gambrel? Let me beg\r\n     You'll look at a horse's hinder leg;\r\n     First great angle above the hoof,\r\n     That's the gambrel, hence the gambrel roof.\"\r\n\r\nThe Canadians put very flat roofs on their log cabins, usually composed of\r\nlogs laid over the rafters, making them strong enough to support the heavy\r\nweight of snow. The American log cabins, as a rule, are built in a milder\r\nclimate, and the flat sod roof is peculiar to our Northern boundary and\r\nthe hot, arid parts of our country. We build the chimneys outside of our\r\nlog cabins because, as the old settlers would say, \"thar's more room out\r\nthar\" (see Figs. 271, 273).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne-Pen Cabin\r\n\r\nFig. 229 is a one-pen cabin. To build it we first snake our logs to a skid\r\nnear the site of our proposed cabin (Fig. 167), from which we can roll our\r\nlogs to our house as we need them. Lay out the corners and square them\r\n(Fig. 180); notch the logs with a rounded or U-shaped notch (Fig. 165).\r\nRemember that all the logs should be two or three feet longer than the\r\nwalls of the proposed building, but the notches must be the same distance\r\napart in order to make even walls. The protruding ends of the logs may be\r\nallowed to stick out as they happen to come, no matter how irregular they\r\nmay be, until the cabin is erected; then with a two-handed saw and a boy\r\nat each end they can be trimmed off evenly, thus giving a neat finish to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nFig. 229. Fig. 230. Fig. 231. Fig. 232. Fig. 233. Fig. 234.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hints and suggestions in cabin construction.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSills\r\n\r\nThe largest, straightest, and best logs should be saved for sills or\r\nfoundations. If you are building a \"mudsill,\" that is, a building upon the\r\nground itself, the sill logs will be subject to dampness which will cause\r\nthem to rot unless they are protected by some wood preservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWood Preservative\r\n\r\nIf the logs are painted with two or three coats of creosote before they\r\nare laid upon the ground, it will protect them for an indefinite time and\r\nprevent decay. Hugh P. Baker, dean of the New York State College of\r\nForestry, writes me that--\r\n\r\n    two or three applications of warm oil with a brush will be\r\n    very helpful and will probably be all that the ordinary man\r\n    can do. Creosote is the best preservative because of its\r\n    penetrating power and the way it acts upon the fibres of\r\n    wood, and in the end is cheaper than a good many other\r\n    things which have been used to preserve timber. In fact,\r\n    various forms of creosote are best-known preservers of\r\n    organic matter. There is no advantage in using charcoal at\r\n    all and I presume suggestions have been made for using it\r\n    because we know that charred wood is more durable.\r\n    Linseed-oil is good; ordinary white-lead paint will be\r\n    better, but neither of them is as effective as creosote, and\r\n    both are more expensive. You will find that carbolineum and\r\n    other patent preparations are recommended very highly; they\r\n    are good but expensive and the difference in price between\r\n    these patent preparations and ordinary creosote is much\r\n    larger than is justified by their increased value. Creosote\r\n    can be procured in large or small quantities from a number\r\n    of concerns. I think we have been getting it for about ten\r\n    dollars per barrel of fifty or fifty-three gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreosote\r\n\r\nmay be purchased in large or small quantities from various manufacturing\r\ncompanies, such as the Barret Manufacturing Company, 17 Battery Place, New\r\nYork City, and the Chattfield Manufacturing Company, Carthage, O., handle\r\nit in large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpenings\r\n\r\nBuild the pen as if it were to have no openings, either doors, windows, or\r\nfireplaces. When you reach the point where the top of the door, window, or\r\nfireplace is to be (Fig. 229) saw out a section of the log to mark the\r\nplace and admit a saw when it is desired to finish the opening as shown in\r\nthe diagram and continue building until you have enough logs in place to\r\ntack on cleats like those shown in Figs. 229, 230, and 231, after which\r\nthe openings may be sawed out. The cleats will hold the ends of the logs\r\nin place until the boards _U_ (Fig. 232) for the door-jambs,\r\nwindow-frames, or the framework over the fireplace can be nailed to the\r\nends of the logs and thus hold them permanently in place. If your house is\r\na \"mudsill,\" wet the floor until it becomes spongy, then with the butt\r\nend of a log ram the dirt down hard until you have an even, hard\r\nfloor--such a floor as some of the greatest men of this nation first crept\r\nover when they were babies. But if you want a board floor, you must\r\nnecessarily have floor-joists; these are easily made of milled lumber or\r\nyou may use the rustic material of which your house is built and select\r\nsome straight logs for your joists. Of course, these joists must have an\r\neven top surface, which may be made by flattening the logs by scoring and\r\nhewing them as illustrated by Figs. 123, 124, and 125 and previously\r\ndescribed. It will then be necessary to cut the ends of the joist square\r\nand smaller than the rest of the log (Fig. _A_, 229); the square ends must\r\nbe made to fit easily into the notches made in the sill logs (_B_, Fig.\r\n229) so that they will all be even and ready for the flooring (_C_, Fig.\r\n229). For a house ten feet wide the joists should be half a foot in\r\ndiameter, that is, half a foot through from one side to the other; for\r\nlarger spans use larger logs for the joists.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nIf your house is not a \"mudsill\" you may rest your sill logs upon posts or\r\nstone piles; in either case, in the Northern States, they should extend\r\nthree feet below the ground, so as to be below frost-line and prevent the\r\nupheaval of the spring thaw from throwing your house \"out of plumb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRoofing\r\n\r\nAll the old-time log cabins were roofed with shakes, splits, clapboards,\r\nor hand-rived shingles as already described and illustrated by Figs. 126,\r\n128, 129, and 130; but to-day they are usually shingled with the\r\nmachine-sawed shingle of commerce. You may, however, cover the roof with\r\nplanks as shown by Fig. 233 or with bark weighted down with poles as\r\nshown by Fig. 234. In covering it with board or plank nail the latter on\r\nas you would on a floor, then lay another course of boards over the cracks\r\nwhich show between the boards on the first course.\r\n\r\n\r\nGables\r\n\r\nThe gable ends of the cabin should be built up of logs with the rafters of\r\nthe roof running between the logs as they are in Figs. 229 and 233, but\r\nthe roof may be built, as it frequently is nowadays, of mill lumber, in\r\nwhich case it may be framed as shown by Figs. 49, 51, and the gable end\r\nabove the logs filled in with upright poles as shown in Figs. 173 and 247,\r\nor planked up as shown in the Southern saddle-bag (Fig. 241), or the ends\r\nmay be boarded up and covered with tar paper as shown in Fig. 248, or the\r\ngable end may be shingled with ordinary shingles (Fig. 79).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteep Roof\r\n\r\nRemember that the steeper the roof is the longer the shingles will last,\r\nbecause the water will run off readily and quickly on a steep surface and\r\nthe shingles have an opportunity to dry quickly; besides which the snow\r\nslides off a steep roof and the driving rains do not beat under the\r\nshingles. If you are using milled lumber for the roof, erect the rafters\r\nat the gable end first, with the ridge board as shown in Fig. 263 and in\r\ngreater detail in Fig. 49. Put the other rafters two or three feet apart.\r\n\r\nLet your roof overhang the walls by at least seven or eight inches so as\r\nto keep the drip from the rain free of the wall. It is much easier for the\r\narchitect to draw a log house than it is for a builder to erect one, for\r\nthe simple reason that the draughtsman can make his logs as straight as he\r\nchooses, also that he can put the uneven places where they fit best; but\r\nexcept in well-forested countries the tree trunks do not grow as straight\r\nas the logs in my pictures and you must pick out the logs which will fit\r\ntogether. Run them alternately butt and head; that is, if you put the\r\nthick end of the log at the right-hand end of your house, with the small\r\nend at the left, put the next log with the small end at the right and\r\nthick end at the left; otherwise, if all the thick ends are put at one\r\nside and the small ends at the other, your house will be taller at one end\r\nthan at the other as is the case with some of our previous shacks and\r\ncamps (Figs. 190, 191, and 192) which are purposely built that way.\r\n\r\nIf it is planned to have glass window lights, make your window openings of\r\nthe proper size to fit the window-frames which come with the sashes from\r\nthe factory. In any case, if the cabin is to be left unoccupied you should\r\nhave heavy shutters to fit in the window opening so as to keep out\r\ntrespassers.\r\n\r\n\r\nChinking\r\n\r\nIf your logs are uneven and leave large spaces between them, they may be\r\nchinked up by filling the spaces with mud plaster or cement, and then\r\nforcing in quartered pieces of small logs and nailing them or spiking them\r\nin position. If your logs are straight spruce logs and fit snugly, the\r\ncracks may be calked up with swamp moss (Sphagnum), or like a boat, with\r\noakum, or the larger spaces may be filled with flat stones and covered\r\nwith mud. This mud will last from one to seven or eight years; I have some\r\non my own log cabin that has been there even a longer time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nA HUNTER'S OR FISHERMAN'S CABIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIN all the hilly and mountainous States there are tracts of forest lands\r\nand waste lands of no use to the farmer and of no use to settlers, but\r\nsuch places offer ideal spots for summer camps for boys and naturalists,\r\nfor fishermen and sportsmen, and here they may erect their cabins (_see\r\nFrontispiece_) and enjoy themselves in a healthy, natural manner. These\r\ncabins will vary according to the wants of the owners, according to the\r\nmaterial at hand and the land upon which they are built. By extending the\r\nrafters of the roof, the latter may be extended (_see Frontispiece_) to\r\nprotect the front and make a sort of piazza which may be floored with\r\npuncheons.\r\n\r\nThe logs forming the sides of the house may be allowed to extend so as to\r\nmake a wall or fence, as they do on the right-hand side of the\r\nFrontispiece, thus preventing the danger of falling over the cliff upon\r\nwhich this cabin is perched and receiving injury or an unlooked-for\r\nducking in the lake. They may also be extended as they are on the left, to\r\nmake a shield behind which a wood-yard is concealed, or to protect an\r\nenclosure for the storage of the larger camp utensils.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this drawing is made as a suggestion and not to be copied\r\nexactly, because every spot differs from every other spot, and one wants\r\nto make one's house conform to the requirements of its location; for\r\ninstance, the logs upon the right-hand side might be allowed to extend\r\nall the way up to the roof, as they do at the bottom, and thus make a\r\ncosey corner protected from the wind and storm.\r\n\r\nThe windows in such a cabin may be made very small, for all work is\r\nsupposed to be done outdoors, and when more light is needed on the inside\r\nthe door may be left open. In a black-fly country or a mosquito country,\r\nhowever, when you are out of reach of screen doors, mosquito-netting may\r\nbe tacked over the windows and a portière of mosquito-netting over the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A WYOMING OLEBO, A HOKO RIVER OLEBO, A SHAKE CABIN, A CANADIAN\r\nMOSSBACK, AND A TWO-PEN OR SOUTHERN SADDLE-BAG HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the charms of a log-cabin building is the many possibilities of\r\nnovelties suggested by the logs themselves. In the hunter's cabin (_see\r\nFrontispiece_) we have seen how the ends of the logs were allowed to stick\r\nout in front and form a rail for the front stoop; the builders of the\r\nolebos have followed this idea still further.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming Olebo\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 236 we see that the side walls of the pen are allowed to extend on\r\neach side so as to enclose a roofed-over open-air room, or, if you choose\r\nto so call it, a front porch, veranda, stoop, piazza, or gallery,\r\naccording to the section of the country in which you live.\r\n\r\nSo as to better understand this cabin the plan is drawn in perspective,\r\nwith the cabin above and made to appear as if some one had lifted the\r\ncabin to show the ground-floor plan underneath. The olebo roof is built\r\nupon the same plan as the Kanuck (Fig. 244), with this exception, that in\r\nFig. 244 the rooftree or ridge-log is supported by cross logs which are a\r\ncontinuation of the side of the house (_A_, _A_, Figs. 242, 244, and 245),\r\nbut in the olebo the ridge pole or log is supported by uprights (Figs.\r\n236 and 237). To build the olebo lay the two side sill logs first (_A_,\r\n_B_, and _C_, _D_, Fig. 236), then the two end logs _E_, _F_, and _D_, _B_\r\nand proceed to build the cabin as already described, allowing the\r\nirregular ends of the logs to extend beyond the cabin until the pen is\r\ncompleted and all is ready for the roof, after which the protruding ends\r\nof the logs _excepting the two top ones_ may be sawed off to suit the\r\ntaste and convenience of the builder. The olebo may be made of any size\r\nthat the logs will permit and one's taste dictate. After the walls are\r\nbuilt, erect the log columns at _A_ and _C_ (Fig. 236), cut their tops\r\nwedge shape to fit in notches in the ends of the projecting side-plates\r\n(Fig. 144, _A_ and _B_); next lay the end plate (_G_, Fig. 236) over the\r\ntwo top logs on the sides of your house which correspond to the\r\nside-plates of an ordinary house. The end plate _G_ is notched to fit on\r\ntop of the side-plates, and the tops of the side-plates have been scored\r\nand hewn and flattened, thus making a General Putnam joint like the one\r\nshown above (_G_, Fig. 236); but when the ends of the side logs of the\r\ncabin were trimmed off the side-plates or top side logs were allowed to\r\nprotrude a foot or more beyond the others; this was to give room for the\r\nsupporting upright log columns at _A_ and _C_ (see view of cabin, Fig. 236\r\nand the front view, Fig. 237). _H_ and _J_ (Fig. 237) are two more upright\r\ncolumns supporting the end plate which, in turn, supports the short\r\nuprights upon which the two purlins _L_ and _M_ rest; the other purlins\r\n_K_ and _N_ rest directly upon the end plate (Fig. 237). The rear end of\r\nthe cabin can have the gable logged up as the front of the house is in\r\nFig. 240, or filled in with uprights as in Fig. 247. The roof of the olebo\r\nis composed of logs, but if one is building an olebo where it will not be\r\nsubjected during the winter to a great weight of snow, one may make the\r\nroof of any material handy.\r\n\r\nFig. 236. Fig. 237. Fig. 238. Fig. 239. Fig. 240. Fig. 241.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some native American log houses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHoko River Olebo\r\n\r\nThe Hoko River olebo has logs only up to the ceiling of the first story\r\n(Fig. 238), or the half story as the case may be; this part, as you see,\r\nis covered with shakes previously illustrated and described (Figs. 127,\r\n128, 129, and 130). The logs supporting the front of the second story\r\nserve their purpose as pillars or supports only during the winter-time,\r\nwhen the heavy load of snow might break off the unsupported front of the\r\nolebo. In the summer-time they are taken away and set to one side, leaving\r\nthe overhang unsupported in front. The shakes on the side are put on the\r\nsame as shingles, overlapping each other and breaking joints as shown in\r\nthe illustration. They are nailed to the side poles, the ends of which you\r\nmay see protruding in the sketch (Fig. 238).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mossback Cabin\r\n\r\nIn the north country, where the lumbermen are at work, the farmers or\r\nsettlers are looked down upon by the lumberjacks much in the same manner\r\nas the civilians in a military government are looked down upon by the\r\nsoldiers, and hence the lumberjacks have, in derision, dubbed the settlers\r\nmossbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMossback\r\n\r\nFig. 239 shows a mossback's house or cabin in the lake lands of Canada.\r\nThe same type of house I have seen in northern Michigan. This one is a\r\ntwo-pen house, but the second pen is made like the front to the olebo, by\r\nallowing the logs of the walls of the house itself to extend sufficient\r\ndistance beyond to make another room, pen, or division. In this particular\r\ncase the settler has put a shed roof of boards upon the division, but the\r\nmain roof is made of logs in the form of tiles. In Canada these are called\r\n_les auges_ (pronounced [=o]ge), a name given to them by the French\r\nsettlers. The back of this house has a steeper roof than the front, which\r\nroof, as you see, extends above the ends of _les auges_ to keep the rain\r\nfrom beating in at the ends of the wooden troughs. Above the logs on the\r\nfront side of the small room, pen, or addition the front is covered with\r\nshakes. Fig. 240 shows a cabin in the Olympic mountains, but it is only\r\nthe ordinary American log cabin with a shake roof and no windows. A\r\ncooking-stove inside answers for heating apparatus and the stovepipe\r\nprotrudes above the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southern Saddle-Bag or Two-Pen Cabin\r\n\r\nNow we come to the most delightful of all forms of a log house. The one\r\nshown in Fig. 241 is a very simple one, such as might be built by any\r\ngroup of boys, but I have lived in such houses down South that were very\r\nmuch more elaborate. Frequently they have a second story which extends\r\nlike the roof over the open gallery between the pens; the chimneys are at\r\nthe gable ends, that is, on the outside of the house, and since we will\r\nhave quite a space devoted to fireplaces and chimneys, it is only\r\nnecessary to say here that in many portions of the South the fireplaces,\r\nwhile broad, are often quite shallow and not nearly so deep as some found\r\nin the old houses on Long Island, in New York, and the Eastern States. The\r\nopen gallery makes a delightful, cool lounging place, also a place for the\r\nladies to sit and sew, and serves as an open-air dining-room during the\r\nwarm weather; this sort of house is inappropriate and ill fitted for the\r\nclimate which produced the olebo, the mossback, and the Kanuck, but\r\nexactly suited for our Southern States and very pleasant even as far\r\nnorth as Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. I have lived in one part of every\r\nsummer for the last twenty-two years in the mountains of northern\r\nPennsylvania. The saddle-bag may be built by boys with the two rooms ten\r\nby ten and a gallery six feet wide, or the two rooms six by six and a\r\ngallery five feet wide; the plan may be seen on the sketch below the house\r\n(Fig. 241).\r\n\r\nWhere you only expect to use the house in the summer months, a two-pen or\r\nsaddle-bag can be used with comfort even in the Northern States, but in\r\nthe winter-time in such States as Michigan and part of New York, the\r\ngallery would be filled up with drifting snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nNATIVE NAMES FOR THE PARTS OF A KANUCK LOG CABIN, AND HOW TO BUILD ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nIF the writer forgets himself once in a while and uses words not familiar\r\nto his boy readers, he hopes they will forgive him and put all such slips\r\ndown as the result of leaving boys' company once in a while and\r\nassociating with men. The reader knows that men dearly love big, ungainly\r\nwords and that just as soon as boys do something worth while the men get\r\nbusy hunting up some top-heavy name for it.\r\n\r\nWhen one is talking of foreign things, however, it is well to give the\r\nforeign names for those things, and, since the next house to be described\r\nis not a real American one but a native of Canada, the Canadian names are\r\ngiven for its parts. While in northern Quebec, making notes for the\r\nKanuck, the writer enlisted the interest of a fellow member of the\r\nCamp-Fire Club of America, Doctor Alexander Lambert, and through him\r\nsecured the names of all parts of the Canadian shack.\r\n\r\nThe author is not a French-Canadian, and, although, like most of his\r\nreaders, he studied French at school, what he learned of that great\r\nlanguage is now securely locked up in one of the safe-deposit vaults of\r\nhis brain and the key lost.\r\n\r\nHe owns up to his ignorance because he is a scout and would not try to\r\ndeceive his readers, also because if the reader's knowledge of French\r\nenables him to find some error, the writer can sidestep the mistake and\r\nsay, \"'Tain't mine.\" But, joking aside, these names are the ones used in\r\nthe Province of Quebec and are here given not because they are good French\r\nbut because they are the names used by the builders among the natives\r\nknown by the Indians as _les habitants_\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Names of Parts of Cabin\r\n\r\n spruce                             épinette\r\n balsam                             sapin\r\n to chop                            boucher, Figs. 113 and 122\r\n to cut                             couper\r\n logs                               les bois or les billots, _A_, _A_, _A_,\r\n                                      Figs. 242, 245, also 119, 126, etc.\r\n square                             carré\r\n door                               porte, Figs. 242, 243\r\n window                             châssis, Fig. 243\r\n window-glass                       les vitres, 242\r\n the joist on which the floor is\r\n   laid                             les traverses, Fig. 49, _B_, _B_, _B_,\r\n                                      _B_, Fig. 244\r\n the floor itself                   plancher\r\n the purlins, that is, the two big\r\n   logs used to support the roof    les poudres, _C_, _C_, Fig. 244\r\n the roof                           couverture, Fig. 242\r\n bark                               écorce\r\n birch bark                         bouleau\r\n the poles put on a birch-bark\r\n   roof to keep the bark flat       les péches, Figs. 41, 234, 242\r\n the hollow half-logs sometimes\r\n   used like tiling on a roof       les auges, Fig. 246\r\n piazza, porch, front stoop,\r\n   veranda                          galerie, Figs. 236, 237, and 241\r\n\r\nThe only thing that needs explanation is the squaring of the round logs of\r\nthe cabin. For instance, instead of leaving the logs absolutely round and\r\nuntouched inside the camp, after the logs are placed, they are squared off\r\nso as to leave a flat surface (Fig. 125). They call this the _carréage_. I\r\ndo not know whether this is a local name or whether it is an expression\r\npeculiar to that Quebec section of Canada or whether it is simply a\r\ncorruption of better French. It is derived from the word _carrer_, to\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nFig. 242. Fig. 243. Fig. 244. Fig. 245. Fig. 246. Fig. 247.\r\n\r\nFig. 248. Fig. 249.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing construction of the common Canadian log house.]\r\n\r\nThe perspective drawings (Figs. 242 and 243) show views of the cabin we\r\ncall the Kanuck. The pen is built exactly as it is built in the houses\r\nalready described. The windows are placed where the builder desires, as is\r\nalso the doorway, but when the side-plate logs, that is\r\n\r\n\r\nLes Traverses\r\n\r\nor top side logs, are put in place, then the traverses logs (_B_, _B_,\r\n_B_, _B_, Fig. 244) are laid across the pen from one side-plate to the\r\nother, their ends resting on top of the side-plates over the traverses\r\nlogs, the two purlins\r\n\r\n\r\nLes Poudres\r\n\r\n(_C_, _C_, Fig. 244) are notched and fitted, and over their ends the two\r\npieces _D_, _D_ are fitted, and, resting on the centres of the _D_ logs,\r\nthe ridge log (_E_, Fig. 244) is placed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouverture\r\n\r\nThe roof is made of small logs flattened on the under-side or left in\r\ntheir rounded form (Fig. 242) and laid from the ridge logs down, extending\r\nover the eaves six or more inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLes Péches\r\n\r\nThe roof logs are then held in place by poles pegged with wooden pegs to\r\nthe roof (_F_, _G_, Fig. 242).\r\n\r\n\r\nRoofing Material\r\n\r\nThe roof is now covered with a thick layer of browse, hay, straw, dry\r\nleaves, or dry grass, and on top of this moist blue clay, yellow clay,\r\nhard-pan, or simple mud is spread and trampled down hard, forcing the\r\nthatch underneath into all the cracks and crannies and forming a firm\r\ncovering of clay several inches thick.\r\n\r\n\r\nFireplace\r\n\r\nThe fireplace and chimney may be built inside or outside the cabin, or the\r\nhouse may be heated by a stove and the stovepipe allowed to protrude\r\nthrough a hole in the roof large enough to separate the pipe a safe\r\ndistance from the wood and straw and amply protected by a piece of sheet\r\niron or tin. Then, after you have stored your _butin_ (luggage), you can\r\nsit and sing:\r\n\r\n    You may pull the _sourdine_ out\r\n    You may push the _rabat-joie_ in\r\n    But the _boucan_ goes up the _cheminée_ just the same\r\n    Just the same, just the same,\r\n    But the _boucan_ goes up the _cheminée_ just the same.\r\n\r\nWhen \"l'habitant\" hears you sing this verse he will not know what your\r\nsong is about, but he will slap you on the back, laugh, and call you _Bon\r\nHomme chez nous_, but do not get mad at this; it is a compliment and not a\r\nbad name.\r\n\r\n\r\nClay Roof\r\n\r\nA clay roof should be as flat as possible with only pitch enough to shed\r\nthe water; a shingle roof should have a rise of at least one foot high to\r\nfour feet wide and a thatched roof should have a rise of 45°, that is,\r\nthe rise of a line drawn from corner to corner of a square.\r\n\r\nFig. 247 shows a gable filled with upright logs and Fig. 248 shows a tar\r\npaper roof and a gable covered with tar paper.\r\n\r\nSince Kanucks are cold-climate houses, they frequently have novel means of\r\nkeeping them warm; one way that I have frequently seen used is to surround\r\nthem with a log fence shown in Fig. 249, and pack the space between with\r\nstable manure or dirt and rotten leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A POLE HOUSE AND HOW TO MAKE A UNIQUE BUT THOROUGHLY AMERICAN\r\nTOTEM LOG HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA POLE house is a log house with the logs set upright. We call it a pole\r\nhouse because, usually, the logs are smaller than those used for a log\r\nhouse. The pole house (Fig. 250) is built in the manner shown by Figs.\r\n171, 172, and 173, but in the present instance the ridge-pole is a log\r\nwhich is allowed to extend some distance beyond the house both in front\r\nand rear, and the front end of the ridge-pole is carved in the shape of a\r\ngrotesque or comical animal's head like those we see on totem-poles. The\r\nroof is made of shakes (see Figs. 126 to 130) and the shakes are held in\r\nplace by poles pegged onto the roof in much the same manner as we have\r\ndescribed and called _les péches_ for the Kanuck. This pole cabin may have\r\nan old-fashioned Dutch door which will add to its quaintness and may have\r\nbut one room which will answer the many purposes of a living-room,\r\nsleeping-room, and dining-room. A lean-to at the back can be used for a\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Totem Log House\r\n\r\nBut if you really want something unique, build a log house on the general\r\nplan shown by Figs. 251 and 252; then carve the ends of all the extending\r\nlogs to represent the heads of reptiles, beasts, or birds; also carve the\r\nposts which support the end logs on the front gallery, porch, or veranda\r\nin the form of totem-poles. You may add further to the quaint effect by\r\nplacing small totem-posts where your steps begin on the walk (Fig. 253)\r\nand adding a tall totem-pole (Fig. 255) for your family totem or the totem\r\nof your clan. Fig. 252 shows how to arrange and cut your logs for the\r\npens. The dining-room is supposed to be behind the half partition next to\r\nthe kitchen; the other half of this room being open, with the front room,\r\nit makes a large living-room. The stairs lead up to the sleeping-rooms\r\noverhead; the latter are made by dividing the space with partitions to\r\nsuit your convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Building\r\n\r\nTake your jack-knife and a number of little sticks to represent the logs\r\nof your cabin; call an inch a foot or a half inch a foot as will suit your\r\nconvenience and measure all the sticks on this scale, using inches or\r\nparts of inches for feet. Then sit down on the ground or on the floor and\r\nexperiment in building a toy house or miniature model until you make one\r\nwhich is satisfactory. Next glue the little logs of the pen together; but\r\nmake the roof so that it may be taken off and put on like the lid to a\r\nbox; keep your model to use in place of an architect's drawing; the\r\nbackwoods workmen will understand it better than they will a set of plans\r\nand sections on paper. Fig. 251 is a very simple plan and only put here as\r\na suggestion. You can put the kitchen at the back of the house instead of\r\non one side of it or make any changes which suit your fancy; the pen of\r\nthe house may be ten by twelve or twenty by thirty feet, a camp or a\r\ndwelling; the main point is to finish your house up with totems as shown\r\nby Fig. 253, and then tell the other fellows where you got the idea.\r\n\r\nFig. 250. Fig. 251. Fig. 252. Fig. 253. Fig. 254. Fig. 255.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A totem motif. An artistic and novel treatment for a log\r\nhouse.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPeeled Logs\r\n\r\nFor any structure which is intended to be permanent never use the logs\r\nwith bark on them; use _peeled_ logs. When your house is finished it may\r\nlook very fresh and new without bark, but one season of exposure to the\r\nweather will tone it down so that it will be sufficiently rustic to please\r\nyour fancy, but if you leave the bark on the logs, a few seasons will rot\r\nyour house down, making it _too_ rustic to suit any one's fancy.\r\n\r\nLay up the pen of this house as already described and illustrated by Figs.\r\n229, 233, etc., and when the sides and front walls have reached the\r\ndesired height, frame your roof after the manner shown by Fig. 49 or any\r\nof the other methods described which may suit your fancy or convenience,\r\nbut in this case we use the Susitna form for the end plates, which are\r\nmade by first severing the root of a tree and leaving an elbow or bend at\r\nthe end of the trunk (Fig. 264). This is flattened by scoring and hewing\r\nas is described and illustrated under the heading of the Susitna house.\r\nThe elbows at the terminals of the end plate are carved to represent\r\ngrotesque heads (Fig. 253). The house when built is something like the\r\nWyoming olebo (Fig. 236), but with the difference which will appear after\r\ncareful inspection of the diagram. The Wyoming olebo is a one-story house;\r\nthis is a two-story house. The Wyoming olebo has a roof built upon a\r\nmodified plan of a Kanuck; this roof is built on the American log-cabin\r\nplan, with the logs continued up to the top of the gable, as are those in\r\nthe Olympic (Fig. 240). But the present house is supposed to be _very\r\ncarefully_ built; to be sure, it is made of rude material but handled in a\r\nvery neat and workmanlike manner. Great care must be used in notching and\r\njoining the logs, and only the straightest logs which can be had should be\r\nused for the walls of the house. The piazza may need some additional\r\nsupports if there is a wide front to the house, but with a narrow front\r\nhalf, log puncheons will be sufficiently stiff to support themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotems\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part about these descriptions, for the writer, is where\r\nhe attempts to tell you how to make your totems; but remember that a\r\ntotem, in order to have a _real_ totem look, must be very crude and\r\namateurish, a quality that the reader should be able to give it without\r\nmuch instruction. The next important thing is that when you make one side\r\nof a head, be it a snake's, a man's, a beast's, or a bird's, make the\r\nother side like it. Do not make the head lopsided; make both sides of the\r\nsame proportions. Flatten the sides of the end of the log enough to give\r\nyou a smooth surface, then sketch the profile on each side of the log with\r\ncharcoal or chalk, carve out the head with a chisel, drawing-knife, and\r\njack-knife, and gouge until you have fashioned it into the shape desired.\r\nIn order to do this the end of the log should be free from the ground and\r\na convenient distance above it. The carving is best done after the house\r\nis practically finished; but the two end plates had better be carved\r\nbefore they are hoisted into place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotem-Poles\r\n\r\nWhen you carve out the totem-poles (Fig. 256 or 262), the log had better\r\nbe put on an elongated sawbuck arrangement which will hold it free from\r\nthe ground and allow one to turn it over as the work may require. Fig. 259\r\nrepresents a peeled log. On this log one may sketch, with chalk, the\r\nvarious figures here represented, then begin by notching the log (Fig.\r\n258) according to the notches which are necessary to carve out the totem.\r\nFigs. 260, 261, and 262 show different views of the same totem figures.\r\nFig. 257 shows how to make a variation of the totem-pole. Paint your totem\r\nheads and figures red, blue, and yellow, and to suit your fancy; the more\r\nstartling they are the better will they imitate the Indian totems. The\r\nweather will eventually tone them down to the harmonious colors of a\r\nTurkish rug.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Boy Pioneers\" I have told how to make various other forms of\r\ntotems, all of which have since been built by boys and men in different\r\nparts of the country. Mr. Stewart Edward White, a member of the Camp-Fire\r\nClub of America, woodsman, plainsman, mountaineer, and African hunter and\r\nexplorer, built himself a totem in the form of a huge bird twelve feet\r\nhigh from the plans published in \"The Boy Pioneers,\" and I anticipate no\r\ngreat difficulty will be encountered by those who try to totemize a log\r\ncabin after the manner shown by Fig. 258. It will not, however, be a small\r\nboy's work, but the small boys who started at the beginning of this book\r\nare older and more experienced now, and, even if they cannot handle the\r\nbig logs themselves, they are perfectly competent to teach their daddies\r\nand uncles and their big brothers how to do it, so they may act as boss\r\nbuilders and architects and let the older men do the heavy work. But\r\nhowever you proceed to build this house, when it is finished you will have\r\na typically native building, and at the same time different from all\r\nothers, as quaint as any bungling bungalow, and in better taste, because\r\nit will fit in the landscape and become part of it and look as if it\r\n_belonged there_, in place of appearing as if it had been blown by a\r\ntornado from some box factory and deposited in an unsuitable landscape.\r\n\r\nFig. 256.

Fig. 261.\r\n\r\nFig. 262.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Totem-poles and how to make them.]\r\n\r\nYou must understand by this that unsuitable refers to the fact that a\r\nbungalow _does not_ belong in the American landscape, although many of the\r\ncottages and shacks, miscalled bungalows, may be thoroughly American and\r\nappropriate to the American surroundings despite the exotic name by which\r\nsome people humble them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A SUSITNA LOG CABIN AND HOW TO CUT TREES FOR THE END PLATES\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDING on a hill overlooking the salt meadows at Hunter's Point, L. I.,\r\nthere was an old farmhouse the roof of which projected over both sides of\r\nthe house four or five feet. The hill on which it stood has been cut away,\r\nthe meadows which it overlooked have been filled up with the dirt from the\r\nhill, and only a surveyor with his transit and the old property-lines map\r\nbefore him could ever find the former location of this house, but it is\r\nsomewhere among the tracks of the Long Island Railroad.\r\n\r\nOpposite the house, on the other side of the railroad track, in the\r\nsection known as Dutch Kills of Long Island City, two other houses of the\r\nsame style of architecture stood; they had double doors--that is, doors\r\nwhich were cut in two half-way up so that you might open the top or bottom\r\nhalf or both halves to suit your fancy. The upper panels of these doors\r\nhad two drop-lights of glass set in on the bias, and between them,\r\nhalf-way down the upper half, was a great brass knocker with a grip big\r\nenough to accommodate both hands in case you really wanted to make a\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nThere was another house of this same description in the outskirts of\r\nHoboken, and I often wondered what the origin of that peculiar roof might\r\nbe. I found this type of house as far north toward the Hudson Bay as the\r\nsettlements go, and still farther north the Susitna house explains the\r\norigin of the overhanging eaves (Fig. 268). Of course the Susitna, as\r\nhere drawn, is not exactly the same as that built by the natives on the\r\nSusitna River, but the end plates (Fig. 263) are the same as those used in\r\nthe primitive houses of the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Cut the Tree\r\n\r\nFig. 264 shows a standing fir-tree and also shows what cuts to make in\r\norder to get the right-shaped log for an end plate. Fig. 265 shows the\r\nmethod of scoring and hewing necessary in order to flatten the end of the\r\nlog as it is in Fig. 266. Fig. 267 shows the style in which the natives\r\nroof their Susitnas with logs. The elbows at the end of the plates (Fig.\r\n266) serve to keep the logs of the roof (Fig. 267) from rolling off, but\r\nthe Susitna log cabin which we are building is expected to have a roof\r\n(Fig. 268) of thatch or a roof of shingles, because we have passed the\r\nrude shacks, sheds, and shelters used for camps and are now building real\r\nhouses in which we may live. The Susitna may be built of round logs or of\r\nflattened logs (_le carréage_), in which case we can use the General\r\nPutnam square notch (Fig. 263) for joining the ends of our logs. In\r\nraising the roof, erect the ridge-pole first. The ridge-pole may be set up\r\non two uprights to which it is temporarily nailed, and the upright props\r\nmay be held in place by the two diagonal props or braces, as shown in Fig.\r\n263. If the logs are squared, cut a small bird's-mouth notch in the rafter\r\nwhere it extends over the side-plate logs of the pen and bevel the top end\r\nof your gable rafters to fit against the ridge-pole as in the diagrams.\r\nThe other rafters are now easily put in place, but if the logs are round\r\nyou must notch the rafters and side-plates as shown by the diagram between\r\nFigs. 263 and 267; the dotted lines show where the rafter and the logs\r\ncome together. Nail your rafters to your ridge-pole and fasten them to the\r\nside-plate with wooden pegs or spikes. The ridge-pole may be allowed to\r\nextend, as in Fig. 268, on each side of the cabin or the elbows (Fig. 266)\r\nmay be attached to each end of the ridge-pole with noses turned up and\r\npainted or carved into a fanciful head as in Fig. 268. If the roof is to\r\nbe shingled, collect a lot of poles about four inches in diameter, flatten\r\nthem on both sides, and nail them to the rafters not more than two inches\r\napart, allowing the ends of the sticks to extend beyond the walls of the\r\nhouse at least six inches.\r\n\r\nFig. 263. Fig. 264. Fig. 265. Fig. 266. Fig. 267. Fig. 268.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Susitna log house.]\r\n\r\nIf you desire to make your own shingles, saw up a hemlock, pine, or spruce\r\nlog into billets of one foot four inches long, then with a froe and a mall\r\n(Fig. 179) split the shingles from the billets of wood, or use a broadaxe\r\nfor the same purpose. Broadaxes are dangerous weapons in the hands of an\r\namateur, but the writer split shingles with a broadaxe upon the shores of\r\nLake Erie when he was but seven years old and, as near as he can count, he\r\nstill has ten toes and ten fingers. If you intend to thatch the roof you\r\nneed not flatten the poles which you fasten across the rafters, because\r\nthe thatch will hide all unevenness of the underpinning. The poles may be\r\nlaid at right angles to the rafters between six and eight inches apart and\r\nthe roof thatched as described and illustrated by Fig. 66. The Susitna\r\nform of house is the one from which the old Long Island farmhouses were\r\nevolved, although the old Long Islanders copied theirs from the homes they\r\nleft in Holland, but we must remember that even the effete civilization of\r\nEurope once had a backwoods country a long, long time ago, and then they\r\nbuilt their houses from the timbers hewn in the forests as our own\r\nancestors did in this country; consequently, many of the characteristics\r\nof present-day houses which seem to us useless and unnecessary are\r\nsurvivals of the necessary characteristics of houses made of crude\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A FIREPLACE AND CHIMNEY FOR A SIMPLE LOG CABIN\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 269 shows a simple form of fireplace which is practically the\r\ngranddaddy of all the other fireplaces. It consists of three walls for\r\nwindbreaks, laid up in stone or sod against some stakes driven in the\r\nground for the purpose of supporting them. The four-cornered stakes are\r\nnotched or forked and small logs are laid horizontally in these forks and\r\non top of this a pyramidal form of a log pen is built of small logs and\r\nbillets, and this answers the purpose of a chimney. This style of\r\nfireplace is adapted to use in camps and rude shacks like those shown by\r\nFigs. 187, 189, 191, and 192; also for the most primitive log cabins, but\r\nwhen we make a real log house we usually plan to have a more elaborate or\r\nmore finished fireplace and chimney. The ground-plan of Fig. 269 is shown\r\nby Fig. 270.\r\n\r\n\r\nMud Hearth\r\n\r\nHere you see there is a mud hearth, a wall of clay plastered over the\r\nstones of the fireplace. This will prevent the fire from cracking and\r\nchipping the stones, but clay is not absolutely necessary in this\r\nfireplace. When, however, you build the walls of your fireplace of logs\r\nand your chimney of sticks the clay _is_ necessary to prevent the fire\r\nfrom igniting the woodwork and consuming it. For a log-framed fireplace,\r\nmake a large opening in the wall of your house and against the ends of the\r\nlogs where you sawed out the opening, erect jamb pieces of planks two or\r\nthree inches thick running up to the log over the fireplace and spiked to\r\nthe round ends of the logs (see plan, Fig. 272). Next, lay your foundation\r\nof sill logs on the fireplace, first two side logs and then a back log,\r\nneatly notched so as to look like the logs in the walls of the cabin.\r\nBuild your fireplace walls as shown by Fig. 271, after which take your mud\r\nor clay and make the hearth by hammering the clay down hard until you have\r\na firm, smooth foundation. The front hearth may be made, as shown in the\r\ndiagram, of stones of any size from pebbles to flagstones, with the\r\nsurfaces levelled by sinking the under-part down into the clay until a\r\nuniform level is reached on top. The fireplace may be built with bricks of\r\nmoist clay and wet clay used for mortar. Make the clay walls of the\r\nfireplace at least one foot thick and pack it down hard and tight as you\r\nbuild it. If you choose you may make a temporary inside wall of plank as\r\nthey do when they make cement walls, and then between the temporary board\r\nwall and the logs put in your moist clay and ram it down hard until the\r\ntop of the fireplace is reached, after which the boards may be removed and\r\nthe inside of the fireplace smoothed off by wiping it with a wet cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nStick Chimney\r\n\r\nAfter the walls of logs and clay are built to top of the fireplace proper,\r\nsplit some sticks and make them about one inch wide by one and one half\r\ninch thick, or use the round sticks in the form in which they grow, but\r\npeel off the bark to render them less combustible; then lay them up as\r\nshown by Fig. 261, log-cabin style. With the chimney we have four sides to\r\nthe wall in place of three sides as in the fireplace. The logs of the\r\nfireplace, where they run next to the cabin, may have to be chinked up so\r\nas to keep them level, but the chimney should be built level as it has\r\nfour sides to balance it. Leave a space between the chimney and the\r\noutside wall and plaster the sticks thickly with clay upon the outside and\r\nmuch thicker with clay upon the inside, as shown by Fig. 271 _A_, which is\r\nsupposed to be a section of the chimney.\r\n\r\nFig. 269. Fig. 270. Fig. 271. Fig. 271A. Fig. 272. Fig. 273.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail for fireplaces and flues.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDurability\r\n\r\nAll through the mountains of East Tennessee and Kentucky I have seen these\r\nstick chimneys, some of them many, many years old. In these mountain\r\ncountries the fireplaces are lined with stones, but in Illinois, in the\r\nolden times, stones were scarce and mud was plenty and the fireplaces were\r\nmade like those just described and illustrated by Fig. 272.\r\n\r\nThe stone chimney is an advance and improvement upon the log chimney, but\r\nI doubt if it requires any more skill to build.\r\n\r\n\r\nChimney Foundation\r\n\r\nDig your foundation for your fireplace and chimney at least three feet\r\ndeep; then fill the hole up with small cobblestones or broken bluestone\r\nuntil you have reached nearly the level of the ground; upon this you can\r\nbegin to lay your hearth and chimney foundation. If you fail to dig this\r\nfoundation the frost will work the ground under your chimney and the\r\nchimney will work with the ground, causing it either to upset or to tilt\r\nto one side or the other and spoil the looks of your house, even if it\r\ndoes not put your fireplace out of commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nStone Chimney\r\n\r\nIn laying up the stones for your chimney, remember that it makes no\r\ndifference how rough and uneven it is upon the outside. The more uneven\r\nthe outside is the more picturesque it will appear, but the smoother and\r\nmore even the inside is the less will it collect soot and the less will be\r\nthe danger of chimney fires. Lay your stones in mortar or cement. See that\r\neach stone fits firmly in the bed and does not rock and that it breaks\r\njoints with the other stone below it. By breaking joints I mean that the\r\ncrack between the two stones on the upper tier should fit over the middle\r\nof the stone on the lower tier; this, with the aid of the cement, locks\r\nthe stones and prevents any accidental cracks which may open from\r\nextending any further than the two stones between which it started. If,\r\nhowever, you do not break joints, a crack might run from the top to the\r\nbottom of the chimney causing it to fall apart. Above the fireplace make\r\nfour walls to your chimney, as you did with your stick chimney (Fig. 271),\r\nand let the top of the chimney extend above the roof at least three feet;\r\nthis will not only help the draught but it will also lessen the danger of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\nHEARTHSTONES AND FIREPLACES\r\n\r\n\r\nIN erecting the fireplace for your cabin the stone work should extend into\r\nthe cabin itself, thus protecting the ends of the logs from the fire. The\r\nstone over the top of the fireplace (_A_, _B_, Fig. 274) rests upon two\r\niron bars; these iron bars are necessary for safety because, although the\r\nstone _A_, _B_ may bridge the fireplace successfully, the settling of the\r\nchimney or the heat of the fire is liable to crack the stone, in which\r\ncase, unless it is supported by two flat iron bars, it will fall down and\r\nwreck your fireplace. The stone _A_, _B_ in Fig. 275, has been cracked for\r\nfifteen years but, as it rests upon the flat iron bars beneath, the crack\r\ndoes no harm.\r\n\r\nFig. 274. Fig. 275.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fireplace in author's cabin, and suggestion for stone and\r\nwood mantel.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 274 (the ends of the fireplace) the two wing walls of it are built\r\nup inside the cabin to support a plank for a mantelpiece. Another plank\r\n_C_, _D_ is nailed under the mantelpiece against the log before the stone\r\nwork is built up. This is only for the purpose of giving a finish to your\r\nmantelpiece. The hearth in Fig. 274 is made of odd bits of flat stones\r\nlaid in cement, but the hearth in Fig. 275 is one big slab of bluestone\r\njust as it came from the quarry, and the fireplace in Fig. 275 is lined\r\nwith fire-brick. The two three-legged stools which you see on each side\r\nwere made by the woodsmen who built the cabin to use in their camp while\r\nthe cabin was being erected. The stools have occupied the position of\r\nhonor on each side of the fireplace now for twenty-seven years. The\r\nmantelpiece in this drawing is made of puncheons with the rounded side out\r\non the two supports and the flat side against the wall; of course, for the\r\nmantel itself, the rounded side must be down and the flat side up. This\r\nfireplace has been used for cooking purposes and the crane is still\r\nhanging over the flames, while up over the mantel you may see, roughly\r\nindicated, a wrought-iron broiler, a toaster, and a brazier. The flat\r\nshovel hanging to the left of the fireplace is what is known as a \"peal,\"\r\nused in olden times to slip under the pies or cakes in the old-fashioned\r\novens in order to remove them without burning one's fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\nMORE HEARTHS AND FIREPLACES\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES it is desired to have a fireplace in the middle of the room.\r\nPersonally, such a fireplace does not appeal to me, but there are other\r\npeople who like the novelty of such a fireplace, and Fig. 276 shows one\r\nconstructed of rough stones. The fireplace is high so that one tending it\r\ndoes not have to stoop and get a backache. The foundation should be built\r\nin the ground underneath the cabin and up through the floor. A flat stone\r\ncovers the top of the fireplace, as in the other drawings. Fig. 277 shows\r\na fireplace with a puncheon support for a plank mantel.\r\n\r\nFig. 276. Fig. 277. Fig. 278. Fig. 279. Fig. 280.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fireplace and mantel of half logs. Also centre fireplaces\r\nfor cabin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Plank Mantel\r\n\r\n_A_ and _B_ are two half logs, or puncheons, which run from the floor to\r\nthe ceiling on each side of the fireplace. _S_, _S_, _S_ are the logs of\r\nthe cabin walls. _C_ is the puncheon supporting the mantel and _D_ is the\r\nmantel. Fig. 279 shows a section or a view of the mantel looking down on\r\nit from the top, a topographical view of it. Fig. 278 is the same sort of\r\na view showing the puncheon _A_ at the other end of the mantel before the\r\nmantel is put in place between the two puncheons _A_ and _B_. In Fig. 279\r\nthe reader may see that it will be necessary to cut the corners out of the\r\nmantel-board in order to fit it around the puncheons _A_ and _B_; also,\r\nsince _A_ and _B_ have rounded surfaces, it will be necessary to so bevel\r\nthe ends of the puncheon (_C_, Fig. 277) that they will fit on the rounded\r\nsurfaces of _A_ and _B_. Fig. 280 shows the end of _C_ bevelled in a\r\nperspective view, and also a profile view of it, with the puncheon _A_\r\nindicating the manner in which _C_ must be cut to fit upon the rounded\r\nsurface. This makes a simple mantelpiece but a very appropriate one for a\r\nlog cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\nFIREPLACES AND THE ART OF TENDING THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of my readers has written to me asking what to do about a fireplace\r\nthat smokes. Not knowing the fireplace in question, I cannot prescribe for\r\nthat particular invalid, but I have a long acquaintance with many\r\nfireplaces that smoke and fireplaces that do not--in other words, healthy\r\nfireplaces with a good digestion and diseased fireplaces functionally\r\nwrong with poor digestion--so perhaps the easiest way to answer these\r\nquestions is to describe a few of my acquaintances among the fireplaces\r\nwhich I have studied.\r\n\r\nThere is an old fireplace in Small Acres, Binghamton, N. Y., of which I\r\nmade sketches and took measurements which furnished me data by which I\r\nbuilt the fireplaces in my own houses.\r\n\r\nIn Binghamton fireplaces the side walls are on an angle and converge\r\ntoward the back of the fireplace, as in Fig. 274. The back also pitches\r\nforward, as in Fig. 282. The great advantage of this is the reflecting of\r\nmore heat into the room.\r\n\r\nFig. 281 shows the fireplace before which I am now working. The fire was\r\nstarted in last November and is now (April 1) still burning, although it\r\nhas not been rekindled since it was first lighted. This fireplace is well\r\nconstructed, and on very cold days I have the fire burning out on the\r\nhearth fully a foot beyond the line of the mantel without any smoke coming\r\ninto my studio.\r\n\r\nFig. 282 shows a diagram with the dimensions of my studio fireplace and\r\nrepresents the vertical section of it. I give these for the benefit of the\r\npeople who want to know how to build a fireplace which will not smoke.\r\nBut, of course, even the best of fireplaces will smoke if the fire is not\r\nproperly arranged. With smoke the angle of reflection would be equal to\r\nthe angle of incidence did not the constant tendency of smoke to ascend\r\nmodify this rule.\r\n\r\nThrow a rubber ball against the wall and the direction from your hand to\r\nwhere it strikes the wall makes the angle of incidence; when the ball\r\nbounces away from the wall it makes the angle of reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of the Fire\r\n\r\nBut, before we enter into the question regarding the structure of the flue\r\nwe will take up the management of the fire itself. In the first place,\r\nthere is but one person who can manage a fire, and that is yourself.\r\nServants never did and never will learn the art, and, as I am writing for\r\nmen, and the ladies are not supposed to read this article, I will state\r\nthat the fair sex show a like deficiency in this line. The first thing a\r\nwoman wants to do with a fire is to make the logs roost on the andirons,\r\nthe next thing is to remove every speck of ashes from the hearth, and then\r\nshe wonders why the fire won't burn.\r\n\r\nThe ashes have not been removed from my studio fire since it was first\r\nlighted last fall. Ashes are absolutely essential to control a wood-fire\r\nand to keep the embers burning overnight. Fig. 288 shows the present state\r\nof the ashes in my studio fire. You will see by this diagram that the logs\r\nare not resting on the andirons. I only use the andirons as a safeguard to\r\nkeep the logs from rolling out on the hearth. If the fire has been\r\nreplenished late in the evening with a fresh log, before retiring I pull\r\nthe front or the ornamental parts of the andirons to the hearth and then\r\nlay the shovel and poker across them horizontally. When the burning log is\r\ncovered with ashes and the andirons arranged in this manner you can retire\r\nat night with a feeling of security and the knowledge that if your house\r\ncatches afire it will not be caused by the embers in your fireplace. Then\r\nin the morning all you have to do is to shovel out the ashes from the rear\r\nof the fireplace, put in a new backlog, and bed it in with ashes, as shown\r\nin Fig. 286. Put your glowing embers next to the backlog and your fresh\r\nwood on top of that and sit down to your breakfast with the certainty that\r\nyour fire will be blazing before you get up from the table.\r\n\r\nDon't make the mistake of poking a wood-fire, with the idea, by that\r\nmeans, of making it burn more briskly, or boosting up the logs to get a\r\ndraught under them.\r\n\r\nTwo logs placed edge to edge, like those in Fig. 288, with hot coals\r\nbetween them, will make their own draught, which comes in at each end of\r\nthe log, and, what is essential in fire building, they keep the heat\r\nbetween themselves, constantly increasing it by reflecting it back from\r\none to the other. If you happen to be in great haste to make the flames\r\nstart, don't disturb the logs but use a pair of bellows.\r\n\r\nFig. 287 shows a set of the logs which will make the best-constructed\r\nfireplace smoke. The arrow-point shows the line of incidence or the\r\nnatural direction which the smoke would take did not the heat carry it\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nFig. 285 shows the same logs arranged so that the angle of incidence\r\nstrikes the back of the chimney and the smoke ascends in the full and\r\norderly manner. But both Figs. 285 and 287 are clumsily arranged. The _B_\r\nlogs in each case should be the backlog and the small logs _A_ and _C_\r\nshould be in front of _B_.\r\n\r\nFig. 281. Fig. 282. Fig. 283. Fig. 284. Fig. 285. Fig. 286.\r\n\r\nFig. 287. Fig. 288.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Proper and improper ways to build a fireplace and make a\r\nfire.]\r\n\r\nIn all of the fireplaces which we have described you will note that the\r\ntop front of the fireplace under the mantel extends down several inches\r\nbelow the angle of the chimney.\r\n\r\nFig. 283 shows a fireplace that is improperly built. This is from a\r\nfireplace in a palatial residence in New York City, enclosed in an antique\r\nItalian marble mantel, yellow with age, which cost a small fortune. The\r\nfireplace was designed and built by a firm of the best architects,\r\ncomposed of men famed throughout the whole of the United States and\r\nEurope, _but the fireplace smoked_ because the angle of the chimney was\r\nbelow the opening of the fireplace and, consequently, sent the smoke out\r\ninto the room. This had to be remedied by setting a piece of thick plate\r\nglass over the top of the fireplace, thus making the opening smaller and\r\nextending it below the angle of the chimney.\r\n\r\nFig. 284 shows the most primitive form of fireplace and chimney. One that\r\na child may see will smoke unless the fire is kept in the extreme back of\r\nthe hearth.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of ashes in your fireplace are manifold. They retain the\r\nheat, keep the hot coals glowing overnight, and when the fire is too hot\r\nmay be used to cover the logs and subdue the heat. But, of course, if you\r\nwant a clean hearthstone and the logs roosting upon the andirons, and are\r\ndevoid of all the camp-fire sentiment, have some asbestos gas-logs. There\r\nwill be no dust or dirt, no covering up at night with ashes, no bill for\r\ncord-wood, and it will look as stiff and prim as any New England old maid\r\nand be as devoid of sentiment and art as a department-store bargain\r\npicture frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING OF THE LOG HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nHow a Forty-Foot-Front, Two-Story Pioneer Log House Was Put Up with the\r\nHelp of \"Backwoods Farmers\"--Making Plans with a Pocket Knife.\r\n\r\nOUR log house on the shore of Big Tink Pond, Pike County, Pa., was built\r\nlong before the general public had been educated to enjoy the subtle\r\ncharms of wild nature, at a time when nature-study was confined to\r\nscientists and children, and long before it was fashionable to have wild\r\nfowl on one's lawn and wild flowers in one's garden. At that time only a\r\nfew unconventional souls spent their vacations out of sight of summer\r\nhotels, camping on the mountain or forest trails. The present state of the\r\npublic mind in regard to outdoor life has only been developed within the\r\nlast few years, and when I first announced my intention of hunting up some\r\naccessible wild corner and there erecting a log house for a summer studio\r\nand home I found only unsympathetic listeners. But I was young and rash at\r\nthat time, and without any previous experience in building or the aid of\r\nbooks to guide me and with only such help as I could find among backwoods\r\nfarmers I built a forty-foot-front, two-story log house that is probably\r\nthe pioneer among log houses erected by city men for summer homes. It gave\r\nMr. Charles Wingate the suggestions from which he evolved Twilight Park in\r\nthe Catskills. Twilight Park, being the resort of literary people and\r\ntheir friends, did much to popularize log houses with city people.\r\n\r\nThe deserted farms of New England offer charming possibilities for those\r\nwhose taste is for nature with a shave, hair cut, and store clothes, but\r\nfor lovers of untamed nature the waste lands offer stronger inducements\r\nfor summer-vacation days, and there is no building which fits so naturally\r\nin a wild landscape as a good, old-fashioned log cabin. It looks as if it\r\nreally belonged there and not like a windfall from some passing whirlwind.\r\n\r\nWhen I make the claim that any ordinary man can build himself a summer\r\nhome, I do not mean to say that he will not make blunders and plenty of\r\nthem; only fools never make mistakes, wise men profit by them, and the\r\nreader may profit by mine, for there is no lack of them in our log house\r\nat Big Tink. But the house still stands on the bank overlooking the lake\r\nand is practically as sound as it was when the last spike was driven,\r\ntwenty-seven years ago.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the original log cabins that were once sprinkled through the\r\neastern part of our country disappeared with the advent of the saw-mill,\r\nand the few which still exist in the northern part of the country east of\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains would not be recognized as log houses by the\r\ncasual observer, for the picturesque log exteriors have been concealed by\r\na covering of clapboards.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I discovered that even among the old mountaineers I could\r\nfind none who had ever attended a log-rolling frolic or participated in\r\nthe erection of a real log house. Most of these old fellows, however,\r\ncould remember living in such houses in their youth, but they could not\r\nunderstand why any sane man of to-day wanted \"to waste so much good\r\nlumber,\" and in the quaint old American dialect still preserved in these\r\nregions they explained the wastefulness of my plans and pointed out to me\r\nthe number of good planks which might be sawed from each log.\r\n\r\nFig. 289.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wildlands, the author's log house in Pike County, Pa.]\r\n\r\nFig. 290, _B_, shows the plans of the house, which will be seen to be a\r\nmodification of the Southern \"saddle-bag\" cabin--two houses under one\r\nroof. By referring to Fig. 289 it will be seen that above the gallery\r\nthere is a portico, which we called the \"afterthought\" because it did not\r\nappear upon the original plans. We got the hint, as \"Jimmy\" called it,\r\nwhen it was noticed that chance had ordained that the two \"_A_\" logs\r\nshould protrude much farther than the others. \"Don't saw them off,\" I\r\nexclaimed; \"we will have a balcony\"; and so the two \"_A_\" logs were left,\r\nand this gave us room for a balcony over the gallery, back of which is a\r\nten-by-ten bedroom, while the two large bedrooms on each side have doors\r\nopening on the six-foot passageway, which is made still broader by the\r\naddition of the balcony.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is a stairway marked out on the ground plan,\r\nbut there was none on the original plan, for, to tell the honest truth, I\r\ndid not know where to put the stairs until the logs were in place.\r\nHowever, it is just such problems that lend charm to the work of building\r\nyour own house. An architect or a professional builder would have the\r\nthing all cut and dried beforehand and leave nothing to chance and\r\ninspiration; this takes the whole charm out of the work when one is\r\nbuilding for recreation and the pleasure to be derived from the\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nWhen our house was finished we had no shutters to the windows and no way\r\nof closing up the open ends of the gallery, and my helpers told me that I\r\nmust not leave the house that way because stray cattle would use the house\r\nfor a stable and break the windows with their horns as they swung their\r\nheads to drive away the flies. So we nailed boards over these openings\r\nwhen we closed the house for the winter. Later we invented some shutters\r\n(see _C_, Fig. 290) which can be put up with little trouble and in a few\r\nmoments. Fig. 290, _C_, shows how these shutters are put in place and\r\nlocked on the inside by a movable sill that is slid up against the bottom\r\nof the shutters and fastened in place by iron pins let into holes bored\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nFig. 290.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of author's log house, Wildlands.]\r\n\r\nOf course, this forms no bar to a professional burglar, but there is\r\nnothing inside to tempt cracksmen, and these professional men seldom stray\r\ninto the woods. The shutters serve to keep out cattle, small boys, and\r\nstray fishermen whose idle curiosity might tempt them to meddle with the\r\ncontents of a house less securely fastened.\r\n\r\nA house is never really finished until one loses interest in it and stops\r\ntinkering and planning homely improvements. This sort of work is a\r\nhealthy, wholesome occupation and just the kind necessary to people of\r\nsedentary occupations or those whose misfortune it is to be engaged in\r\nsome of the nerve-racking business peculiar to life in big cities.\r\n\r\nDwellers in our big cities do not seem to realize that there is any other\r\nlife possible for them than a continuous nightmare existence amid\r\nmonstrous buildings, noisy traffic, and the tainted air of unsanitary\r\nstreets. They seem to have forgotten that the same sun that in summer\r\nscorches the towering masonry and paved sidewalks until the canyon-like\r\nstreets become unbearable also shines on green woods, tumbling waters, and\r\nmirror-like lakes; or, if they are dimly conscious of this fact, they\r\nthink such places are so far distant as to be practically out of their\r\nreach in every sense. Yet in reality the wilderness is almost knocking at\r\nour doors, for within one hundred miles of New York bears, spotted\r\nwildcats, and timid deer live unconfined in their primitive wild\r\ncondition. Fish caught in the streams can be cooked for dinner in New York\r\nthe same day.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, when the writer was himself a bachelor, he went out into the\r\nwilderness on the shores of Big Tink Pond, upon which he built the log\r\nhouse shown in the sketch. At first he kept bachelor hall there with some\r\nchoice spirits, not the kind you find in bottles on the bar-room shelf,\r\nbut the human kind who love the outdoor world and nature, or he took his\r\nparents and near relatives with him for a vacation in the woods. Like all\r\nsensible men, in course of time he married, and then he took his bride out\r\nto the cabin in the woods. At length the time came when he found it\r\nnecessary to shoulder his axe and go to the woods to secure material for a\r\nnew _piece of furniture_. He cut the young chestnut-trees, peeled them,\r\nand with them constructed a crib; and every year for the last eight years\r\nthat crib has been occupied part of the season. Thus, you see, a camp of\r\nthis kind becomes hallowed with the most sacred of human memories and\r\nbecomes a joy not only to the builder thereof but also to the coming\r\ngeneration. At the big, open fire in the grill-room, with the\r\nold-fashioned cooking utensils gathered from farmhouses on Long Island, I\r\nhave cooked venison steaks, tenderloin of the great northern hare, the\r\nplump, white breasts of the ruffed grouse, all broiled over the hot coals\r\nwith slices of bacon, and when done to a turn, placed in a big platter\r\nwith fresh butter and served to a crowd who watched the operation and\r\nsniffed the delicious odor until they literally drooled at the corners of\r\ntheir mouths. As the house was built on a deer runway, all these things\r\nwere products of the surrounding country, and on several occasions they\r\nhave all been served at one meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\nHOW TO LAY A TAR PAPER, BIRCH BARK, OR PATENT ROOFING\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing the Roofing for Laying\r\n\r\nBIRCH BARK and patent roofing are more pliable than tin or shingles,\r\nconsequently taking less time to lay and making it easier work. In very\r\ncold weather put your patent roofing in a warm room a few hours before\r\nusing it. Never try to cut birch bark, tar paper, or patent roofing with a\r\ndull knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoofing Foundation\r\n\r\nNo matter what sort of roofing material is used, do not forget the great\r\nimportance of the roofing foundation (Figs. 296 and 298). If the\r\nfoundation is poor or uneven the roofing will be poor and uneven, even if\r\nonly the best roofing material is used. The sheathing boards should be\r\nmatched if possible and of uniform thickness, laid close, and free from\r\nnails, protruding knots, and sharp edges. Do not use green lumber; the sun\r\nis almost certain to shrink and warp it. Sometimes it will even break the\r\nroofing material. On very particular work, where the rafters are wide\r\napart, the best builders recommend laying a course of boards over the\r\nplanking at right angles to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nValleys\r\n\r\nIf there are valleys in the roof (Fig. 298) use a long strip of roofing\r\nand lay it up and down in the direction of the valleys. Press the strip\r\ninto the hollow so that it takes the shape of the valley itself. Allow the\r\nedges of the roofing to overlap the strip in the valley an equal distance\r\non both sides of the valley (Fig. 298).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Lay the Roofing\r\n\r\nBegin at the eaves to lay the roofing (Fig. 299). Always lay the roll of\r\npatent roofing with the inside surface to the weather and in the same\r\ndirection that the boards run--not at right angles to them. Begin nailing\r\nat the centre of the edges of the strips and work both ways to the\r\nends--never the reverse, as the roofing may become wrinkled, twisted, or\r\ncrooked. Always set caps even with the edge of the laps about two inches\r\napart between their centres.\r\n\r\n\r\nGutters\r\n\r\nTo finish gutters, fasten and carefully cement with the pitch or tar or\r\nprepared composition the edge of the strip about half-way to the gutter.\r\nBring the other edge onto the roof, then lay the next strip over this\r\nstrip so that it will overlap at least two inches. Proceed to lay the\r\nbalance of the roofing in the same way. Never nail the middle of the\r\nstrips; nail only along the edges. The end strips should always be lapped\r\nover the edges of the roof and fastened (Figs. 297 and 299).\r\n\r\nBefore fastening laps paint a two-inch strip with the tar or pitch cement\r\nwhich comes with all patent roofing in order to stick it to the lower\r\nstrip of roofing and to make a tight joint when put in place.\r\n\r\nDo not drive nails carelessly or with too much force and be sure the cap\r\nfits snugly against the roofing. If nails go into holes or open cracks, do\r\nnot remove them but thoroughly cement around them. Allow six inches for\r\noverlaps for joints where one strip joins another (Fig. 299, _B_). Be sure\r\nthat two strips of roofing never meet at the ridge leaving a joint to\r\ninvite a leak over the ridge-pole. Examine the diagrams if you fail to\r\nunderstand the description.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Patch a Shingle Roof\r\n\r\nThe reader must not suppose that the roof of my camp was made of flannel\r\nbecause it shrank, for the whole house, which was made of logs, diminished\r\nin size as the wood became seasoned; so that now each log averages a\r\nquarter of an inch less in width than it did when the house was built\r\ntwenty odd years ago. There are just one hundred logs in the house, which\r\nmakes the house twenty-five inches smaller than it was when it was built,\r\nbut I cannot point out the exact spot where the two feet and one inch are\r\nmissing. Neither do I know that this had anything to do with the opening\r\nin the roof about the chimney; but I do know that the opening gradually\r\nbecame wider and wider until it not only admitted the entrance of numerous\r\nflying squirrels and other varmints but also let in the rain and snow and\r\nconsequently it had to be remedied. Neither the flying squirrels nor the\r\nelements can now enter at that point.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Yankees stop the leaks around the big chimneys of the old\r\nfarmhouses with mortar or concrete, but at permanent camps cement is not\r\nalways handy, and even if one is living in a farmhouse it will probably\r\nnecessitate quite a long drive to procure it. If, however, there happens\r\nto be on hand some strips of the various tar roofing compounds, some old\r\ntin, or even a good piece of oilcloth--by which I mean a piece that may be\r\nso worn as to have been cast aside and yet not so perforated with holes\r\nthat it will admit the rain--it may be used to stop the leak.\r\n\r\nFig. 291. Fig. 292. Fig. 293. Fig. 294. Fig. 296. Fig. 297. Fig.\r\n298. Fig. 299.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to lay a composition roof and how to cover space around\r\nflue. (Fig. 295 is on next plate.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFixtures for Applying Roofing\r\n\r\nThe complete roofing kit consists of cement, caps, and nails. The\r\ngalvanized caps and nails are the best to use; they won't rust. Square\r\ncaps have more binding surface than the ordinary round ones; but we can\r\nmend \"with any old thing.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 291 shows a chimney from which the roof of the house is parted,\r\nleaving a good-sized opening around the smoke-stack. To cover this, take a\r\npiece of roofing compound, tin, oilcloth, tar paper, or paroid and cut as\r\nis shown in the upper diagram (Fig. 292). Make the slits in the two ends\r\nof the material of such a length that when the upper ends are bent back,\r\nas in the lower diagram (Fig. 292), they will fit snugly around the\r\nchimney. You will need one piece like this for each side of the chimney.\r\nWhere the ends of the chimney butt against the ridge of the roof you will\r\nrequire pieces slit in the same manner as the first but _bent\r\ndifferently_. The upper lobe in this case is bent on the bias to fit the\r\nchimney, while the lower one is bent over the ridge of the roof (Figs. 293\r\nand 294).\r\n\r\nTo better illustrate how this is done, Fig. 293 is supposed to show the\r\nchimney with the roof removed. Fig. 294 is the same view of the chimney\r\nwith the two pieces in place. You will need four pieces, two at each end\r\nof the chimney, to cover the ridge of the roof.\r\n\r\nWith all the many varieties of tar paper and composition roofing there\r\ncome tacks or wire nails supplied with round tin disks perforated in the\r\ncentre, which are used as washers to prevent the nail from pulling\r\nthrough the roofing.\r\n\r\nFig. 295 shows the chimney with the patches around it tacked in place, and\r\nthe protruding ends of the parts trimmed off according to the dotted\r\nlines. Fig. 297 shows the way the roofing people put flashing on; but I\r\nlike my own way, as illustrated by Figs. 291, 292, 293, 294, and 295. It\r\nmust not be taken for granted that every camp or farmhouse has a supply of\r\ntin washers, but we know that every camp and farmhouse does have a supply\r\nof tin cans, and the washers may be made from these, as shown by Figs. 300\r\nand 301. Knock the cans apart at their seams and cut the tin up into\r\npieces like the rectangular one shown under the hand in Fig. 301. Bend\r\nthese pieces in their centres so as to make them into squares, then place\r\nthem on a piece of soft wood and punch holes in them by driving a wire\r\nnail through the tin and you will have better washers than those you can\r\nbuy although they may not be so handsome.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatched Roofs and New Shingles\r\n\r\nAny decent shingled roof should last fifteen years without repairing and\r\nmany of them last nearly twice that time. But there comes a time when the\r\nroof begins to leak and needs mending; when that time comes, with your\r\njack-knife whittle a number of little wooden pegs or splints each about\r\nsix inches long and a little thicker than a pipe-stem with which to\r\n\r\n\r\nMark the Holes\r\n\r\nGo up in the attic and wherever you see daylight through the roof push\r\nthrough the hole a wooden peg to mark the spot. Then, when you have\r\nfinished and are ready to climb on the roof, take off your shoes, put on\r\na pair of woollen socks, and there will be little danger of your slipping.\r\nNew india rubber shoes with corrugated soles are also good to wear when\r\nclimbing on the roof.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 295½ you will see two of the pegs sticking through the roof\r\nmarking the holes, and below is a larger view of one of these pegs\r\nconnected with the upper ones by dotted lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSheet-Iron Shingles\r\n\r\nTo mend simple cracks or holes like these it is only necessary to bend up\r\nbits of tin or sheet iron (Fig. 300) and drive the metal shingle up\r\nunderneath the shingle above the hole so that the \"weather\" part of the\r\ntin covers the leak, or drive it under the leaking shingle itself, or\r\ndrive a new shingle up under or over the damaged one. Where there is a bad\r\nplace in the roof it may be necessary to make a patch of a number of\r\nshingles like the one shown in the right-hand corner of Fig. 295½, but\r\neven then it is not necessary to remove the old shingles unless the hole\r\nis very large.\r\n\r\nThese patches of old tin or new shingles do not look handsome on an old\r\nroof, but they serve their purpose in keeping out the rain and snow and\r\npreventing moisture from rotting the timbers. The weather will soon tone\r\ndown the color of the new shingles so that they will not be noticeable and\r\nyou will have the satisfaction of having a dry roof over your head. There\r\nis only one thing worse than a leaky roof and that is a leaky boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Patching\r\n\r\nIn these days when everybody with a few hundred dollars in pocket is very\r\nsensibly using it to buy a farm and farmhouse so as to be able for a part\r\nof the year to return to the simple life of our ancestors it is very\r\nnecessary that we should also know something of the simple economies of\r\nthose days, for when one finds oneself out on a farm there is no plumber\r\naround the corner and no tinsmith on the next block whom one may call upon\r\nto repair breaks and the damage done by time and weather on an old\r\nfarmhouse. The ordinary man under these conditions is helpless, but some\r\nare inspired by novel ideas, as, for instance, the man who mended the\r\nleaking roof with porous plasters.\r\n\r\nFig. 295. Fig. 295½. Fig. 300. Fig. 301. Fig. 302. Fig. 303. Fig.\r\n304.\r\n\r\nFig. 305. Fig. 306.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to mend a shingle or tin roof.]\r\n\r\nBut for the benefit of those who are not supplied with a stock of porous\r\nplasters I will tell how to do the plumbing and how to mend the tin roof\r\nwith old bits of tin, rags, and white lead; and to begin with I want to\r\nimpress upon the reader's mind that this will be no bungling, unsightly\r\npiece of work, but much more durable and just as neat as any piece of work\r\nwhich the professionals would do for him. In the first place, if you have\r\nan old tin roof on one of the extensions of your house or on your house\r\nitself, do not be in haste to replace it with a new one. Remember that\r\nmost of the modern sheet tin is made by modern methods and its life is not\r\nan extended one. The sheet _steel_ they often use in place of sheet _iron_\r\nrapidly disintegrates and such a roof will not last you half the time that\r\na properly patched old one will.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the house in which I am writing this article is made of tin\r\nand was made about sixty years ago; it has been patched and mended but to\r\nno great extent, and it bids fair to outlive me. Had it been made of sheet\r\nsteel it would have been necessary to renew it many times since that\r\nperiod. So, if you find that the tin roof to your farmhouse, bungalow, or\r\ncamp leaks in consequence of some splits at the seams and a few rust holes\r\npatch them yourself. Fig. 301 shows the only material necessary for that\r\npurpose. You do not even need a pair of shears to cut your tin, for it is\r\nmuch better folded over and hammered into shape, as shown by Fig. 301.\r\nFig. 302 shows a crack and some rust holes in the tin roof. Take your\r\ncarpet-tacks and hammer and neatly tack down the edges of the opening, as\r\nshown by Fig. 303. If there is any difficulty in driving tacks through the\r\ntin roof, use a small wire nail and hammer to first punch the holes. Put\r\nthe tacks close together. With your paint-brush thickly coat the mended\r\nparts with white lead, as shown by Fig. 304. Cut a strip of a rag to fit\r\nover the holes and tack it at its four corners, as shown by Fig. 305. Now,\r\nthen, cover the rag with a thick coat (Fig. 306) of the white lead. Next\r\ntack the tin over the wounded spots, putting the tacks close together, as\r\nshown by Fig. 306. Afterward coat the tin with a covering of white lead\r\nand the patchwork is done. The roof will not leak again at those spots in\r\nthe next twenty years. This will leave white, unsightly blotches on the\r\nroof, but after the white lead is dry a few dabs with the red roof paint\r\nwill make the white patches the same color as the surrounding tin and\r\neffectually conceal them.\r\n\r\nDo not forget the importance of carefully going over your roof after it is\r\nmended and make sure that every joint is properly covered, tacked, and\r\nthoroughly coated with white lead. Cover all joints, nails, and caps with\r\na coat of white lead. Water will not run through the tin roofing, but it\r\nwill find its way through nail holes, rust holes, and open seams if they\r\nare not made absolutely tight.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlumbing\r\n\r\nAfter I had finished doctoring up the kitchen roof of my farmhouse, I\r\ndiscovered that the drain-pipe from the kitchen sink had a nasty leak\r\nwhere the pipe ran through the cellar. Of course, there was no plumber\r\nhandy--plumbers do not live in farming districts--so it was \"up to\" me and\r\nmy helper to stop the leak as best we could. A few blows on the lead with\r\nthe hammer, carefully administered, almost closed the hole. I then had\r\nrecourse to the white lead which I had been using on the kitchen roof, and\r\nI daubed the pipe with paint; still the water oozed through; but after I\r\nhad applied a strip of linen to the leak and then neatly wrapped it round\r\nand painted the whole of it with white lead the leak was effectually\r\nstopped, and the pipe is apparently as good now, six years after the\r\nmending, as it was when it was new.\r\n\r\nIn this sort of work it must be remembered that it is the white lead we\r\ndepend upon, and the other material which we use--the tin and the\r\nrags--are only for the purpose of protecting and holding the white lead in\r\nplace. Of course, a roof may be mended with tar, but that is always\r\nunsightly and insists upon running when heated by a hot sun; besides, it\r\nis most difficult to conceal and does not come ready for use like white\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nIf the leak happens to be around the chimney it can be mended by bending\r\npieces of tin up against the chimney according to the diagram shown for\r\nthe tar paper and patent roofings (Figs. 295 and 297).\r\n\r\n\r\nFlashings, Chimneys, Walls, Etc.\r\n\r\nLead or copper is best for flashings, but in case metal is not convenient\r\nyou will find that various patent roofing materials are good substitutes.\r\nRun the strips of roofing to the angle formed by the object to be flashed\r\nand extend the same up the object three or four inches. Fasten these\r\nstrips to the roof in the usual way or by nailing cleats of wood over the\r\ntop edges.\r\n\r\nLeaks in tubs, barrels, and tanks used about the farm can be mended with\r\nrags, tin, and white lead in the manner described for the roof and pipe.\r\nAlso leaks in the leaders running from the roof may be treated in the same\r\nmanner, but if you must get new leaders for your house by no means replace\r\nthe old ones with _galvanized-steel_ tubes. You can tell the difference\r\nbetween galvanized steel and galvanized iron by its appearance. The steel\r\nis brighter and more silvery than the iron, but my experience is that the\r\nsteel will last only two or three years; sometimes one season puts steel\r\npipes out of commission, whereas galvanized iron will last indefinitely.\r\nAfter having three sets of galvanized-steel leaders on my town house, I\r\nhad them replaced with copper leaders; for, although the expense is\r\ngreater, I have found it more economical in the end. For people having\r\nplenty of money to spend on their country houses I would advise the use of\r\ncopper leaders, but folks of limited means will save money patching up the\r\nold tin ones or old galvanized ones instead of replacing them with\r\ngalvanized steel, which is of little service for outdoor wear. There are,\r\nI believe, only a few firms who now manufacture galvanized iron, but your\r\narchitect can find them if you insist upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A CONCEALED LOG CABIN INSIDE OF A MODERN HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was because the writer knew that a great many men and all the boys\r\nrebelled against the conventionalities and restrictions of a modern house\r\nthat he first invented and suggested the surprise den and told how to make\r\none years ago in the _Outing_ magazine. Since that article appeared the\r\nidea has been adopted by a number of people. There is a beautiful one in\r\nToledo, O., where the writer was entertained during the floods, and Doctor\r\nRoot, of Hartford, Conn., has even a better one in his home in that Yankee\r\ncity. Fig. 308 shows a rough sketch of a corner of Doctor Root's surprise\r\nden which he calls his \"loggery.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the outside of the house there is no indication of anything upon the\r\ninside that may not be found in any conventional dwelling, which is the\r\nproper way to build the surprise den.\r\n\r\nFigs. 307, 309, and 310 are sketches made as suggestions to those wishing\r\nto add the surprise den to their dwelling.\r\n\r\nTo fathers and mothers having sons anywhere from twelve to thirty years of\r\nage, it is almost a necessity nowadays to give these boys a room of their\r\nown, popularly known as the \"den,\" a retreat where they can go and sit in\r\na chair without having fancy embroidered tidies adhere to their coat\r\ncollars, where they can lean back in their chairs, if they choose, with no\r\ndanger of ruining the valuable Hepplewhite or breaking the claw feet off a\r\nrare Chippendale--a place where they can relax. The greater the contrast\r\nbetween this room and the rest of the house, the greater will be the\r\nenjoyment derived by the boys to whom it belongs. The only two surprise\r\ndens which I have personally visited are the pride of the lives of two\r\ngentlemen who are both long past the years generally accorded to youth,\r\nbut both of them are still boys in their hearts. The truth is a surprise\r\nden appeals to any man with romance in his soul; and the more grand,\r\nstately, and formal his house may be, the greater will the contrast be and\r\nthe greater the surprise of this den. It is a unique idea and makes a\r\ndelightful smoking-room for the gentlemen of the house as well as a den\r\nfor the boys of the house.\r\n\r\nFig. 307. Fig. 308. Fig. 309. Fig. 310.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suggestions for interiors of surprise dens and sketch of\r\nDr. Root's surprise den.]\r\n\r\nIf the reader's house is already built, the surprise den may be erected as\r\nan addition; it may be built as a log cabin after the manner of any of\r\nthose previously described in this book, or it may be made an imitation\r\nlog cabin by using slabs and nailing them on the walls in place of real\r\nwhole logs. Doctor Root's surprise den, or \"loggery,\" is made of whole\r\nlogs and chinked with moss. Fig. 310 is supposed to be made of slabs, half\r\nlogs, or puncheons nailed to the walls and ceiling and so arranged that\r\nthe visitor cannot detect the deception. Personally, however, I do not\r\nlike deception of any sort and would recommend that the house be made, if\r\npossible, of whole logs; but whatever way you build it, remember that it\r\nmust have a generous, wide fireplace, a crane, and a good hearthstone, and\r\nthat your furniture must either be made of the material to be found in the\r\nwoods or selected from the antique furniture of some old farmhouse, not\r\nmahogany furniture, but Windsor chairs, three-legged stools, and deal-wood\r\ntables--such furniture as might be found in an old pioneer's home.\r\n\r\nFig. 311.

Fig. 320.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of combined door-knob and wooden latch.]\r\n\r\nThe principal thing to the surprise den, however, is the doorway. The\r\noutside of the door--that is, the side seen from the main part of the\r\nhouse--should be as formal as its surroundings and give no indication of\r\nwhat might be on the other side. If it opens from the most formal room in\r\nthe house, so much the better. Fig. 321 shows the outside of the door of\r\nthe surprise den; I do not mean by this outside of the house but a doorway\r\nfacing the dining-room, library, drawing-room, or parlor. Fig. 321 shows\r\none side of the door and Fig. 322 the other side of the same door. In this\r\ninstance one side of the door is supposed to have a bronze escutcheon and\r\na glass knob (Figs. 315 and 316). Of course, any other sort of a knob\r\n(Fig. 313) will answer our purpose, but the inside, or the surprise-den\r\nside, of the door must have\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wooden Latch\r\n\r\nAfter some experiments I discovered that this could be easily arranged by\r\ncutting a half-round piece of hardwood (_F_, Fig. 312) to fit upon the\r\nsquare end _G_ of the knob (Figs. 311 and 313) and be held in place with a\r\nsmall screw (Fig. 314). When this arrangement is made for the door and the\r\nknob put in place as it is in Figs. 315 and 316, a simple wooden latch\r\n(Fig. 317) with the catch _K_ (Fig. 319) and the guard (Fig. 320) may be\r\nfastened upon the den side of the door as shown by _K_, _L_, (Fig. 317).\r\nWhen the door is latched the wooden piece _F_ fits underneath the latch as\r\nshown by Fig. 317. When the knob is turned, it turns the half disk and\r\nlifts the latch _H_ as shown in Fig. 318; this, of course, opens the door,\r\nand the visitor is struck with amazement upon being ushered into a pioneer\r\nbackwoods log cabin, where after-dinner coffee may be served, where the\r\ngentlemen may retire to smoke their cigars, where the master of the house\r\nmay retire, free from the noise of the children, to go over his accounts,\r\nwrite his private letters, or simply sit before the fire and rest his\r\ntired brain by watching the smoke go up the chimney.\r\n\r\nFig. 321. Fig. 322.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The \"surprise den.\" A log house inside a modern mansion.]\r\n\r\nHere also, over the open fire, fish, game, and chickens may be cooked, as\r\nour grandams and granddaddies cooked them, and quaint, old-fashioned\r\nluncheons and suppers served on earthenware or tin dishes, camp style. In\r\ntruth, the surprise den possesses so many charming possibilities that it\r\nis destined to be an adjunct to almost every modern home. It can be\r\nenclosed within the walls of a city house, a suburban house, or added as a\r\nwing to a country house, but in all cases the outside of the surprise den\r\nshould conform in material used and general appearance to the rest of the\r\nhouse so as not to betray the secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD APPROPRIATE GATEWAYS FOR GROUNDS ENCLOSING LOG HOUSES, GAME\r\nPRESERVES, RANCHES, BIG COUNTRY ESTATES, AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST BOY\r\nSCOUTS' CAMP GROUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE great danger with rustic work is the temptation, to which most\r\nbuilders yield, to make it too fancy and intricate in place of practical\r\nand simple. Figs. 323, 324, 325, and 326 are as ornamental as one can make\r\nthem without incurring the danger of being overdone, too ornate, too fancy\r\nto be really appropriate.\r\n\r\nFig. 323. Fig. 324. Fig. 325. Fig. 326.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Which would you rather do or go fishing? Suggestions for\r\nlog gates.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich Would You Rather Do or Go Fishing?\r\n\r\nFig. 328 is a gate made of upright logs with bevelled tops protected by\r\nplank acting as a roof, and a flattened log fitting across the top. The\r\ngate and fence, you may see, are of simple construction; horizontal logs\r\nfor the lower part keep out small animals, upright posts and rails for the\r\nupper part keep out larger animals and at the same time do not shut out\r\nthe view from the outside or the inside of the enclosure. Fig. 324 shows a\r\nroof gateway designed and made for the purpose of supplying building sites\r\nfor barn swallows or other useful birds. The fence for this one is a\r\ndifferent arrangement of logs, practical and not too fancy. Fig. 325 shows\r\na modification of the gate shown by Fig. 323; in this one, however, in\r\nplace of a plank protecting bevelled edges of the upright logs, two\r\nflattened logs are spiked on like rafters to a roof, the apex being\r\nsurmounted by a bird-house. Fig. 326 shows another gateway composed of two\r\nupright logs with a cross log overhead in which holes have been excavated\r\nfor the use of white-breasted swallows, bluebirds, woodpeckers, or\r\nflickers. Fig. 327 is another simple but picturesque form of gateway,\r\nwhere the cross log at the top has its two ends carved after the fashion\r\nof totem-poles. In place of a wooden fence a stone wall is shown. The ends\r\nof the logs (Fig. 327), which are embedded in the earth, should first be\r\ntreated with two or three coats of creosote to prevent decay; but since it\r\nis the moisture of the ground that causes the decay, if you arrange your\r\ngate-posts like those shown in the vertical section (Fig. 328), they will\r\nlast practically forever. Note that the short gate-post rests upon several\r\nsmall stones with air spaces between them, and pointed ends of the upright\r\nlogs rest upon one big stone. The gate-post is fastened to the logs by\r\ncrosspieces of board running horizontally from log to the post, and these\r\nare enclosed inside the stone pier so that they are concealed from view.\r\nThis arrangement allows all the water to drain from the wood, leaving it\r\ndry and thus preventing decay. Fig. 329 shows another form of gate-post of\r\nmore elaborate structure, surmounted by the forked trunk of a tree; these\r\nparts are supposed to be spiked together or secured in place by hardwood\r\npegs.\r\n\r\nNever forget to add the bird-house or bird shelter to every gateway you\r\nmake; it is more important than the gate itself. In my other books I have\r\ndescribed and told how to make various forms of bird-houses, including my\r\ninvention of the woodpecker's house now being manufactured by many firms,\r\nincluding one in Germany, but the reader should make his own bird-houses.\r\nI am glad the manufacturers have taken up these ideas for the good they\r\nwill _do the birds_, but the ideas were published first solely for the use\r\nof the boys in the hopes of educating them both in the conservation of\r\nbird life and in the manual training necessary to construct bird-houses.\r\n\r\nFig. 327. Fig. 328. Fig. 329.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gateways for game preserves, camps, etc.]\r\n\r\nFig. 330. Fig. 331. Fig. 332.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Log gate and details of same.]\r\n\r\nThe reader must have, no doubt, noticed that the problems in this book\r\nhave become more and more difficult as we approach the end, but this is\r\nbecause everything grows; as we acquire skill we naturally seek more and\r\nmore difficult work on which to exercise our skill. These gateways,\r\nhowever, are none of them too difficult for the boys to build themselves.\r\nThe main problem to overcome in building the picturesque log gateway shown\r\nby Fig. 331 is not in laying up the logs or constructing the roof--the\r\nreader has already learned how to do both in the forepart of this\r\nbook--but it is in so laying the logs that the slant or incline on the two\r\noutsides will be exactly the same, also in so building the sides that when\r\nyou reach the top of the open way and place your first overhead log, the\r\nlog will be exactly horizontal, exactly level, as it must be to carry out\r\nthe plan in a workmanlike manner. Fig. 330 shows you the framework of the\r\nroof, the ridge-pole of which is a plank cut \"sway-backed,\" that is, lower\r\nin the centre than at either end. The frame should be roofed with\r\nhand-rived shingles, or at least hand-trimmed shingles, if you use the\r\nmanufactured article of commerce. This gateway is appropriate for a common\r\npost-and-rail fence or any of the log fences illustrated in the previous\r\ndiagrams. Fig. 332 shows how the fence here shown is constructed: the _A_\r\nlogs are bevelled to fit in diagonally, the _B_ and _C_ logs are set in as\r\nshown by the dotted line in Fig. 332. A gateway like the one shown here\r\nwould make a splendid and imposing one for a permanent camp, whether it be\r\na Boy Scout, a Girl Pioneer, a private camp for boys, or simply the\r\nentrance to a large private estate.\r\n\r\nThe writer has made these diagrams so that they may be used by men or\r\nboys; the last one shows a gateway large enough to admit a \"four-in-hand\"\r\nstage-coach or an automobile, but the boys may build it in miniature so\r\nthat the opening is only large enough to admit a pedestrian.\r\n\r\n  _The End_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEARD BOOKS FOR BOYS\r\n\r\nBy DAN C.
