The information can be vouched for as correct. The\r\nportion dealing with agriculture is from the pen of Joseph Marsden,\r\nEsq., Commissioner of Agriculture. The digest of the land law has been\r\nprepared by J. F. Brown, Esq., Commissioner of Public Lands. The\r\nhistorical portion has been written by Prof. Alexander, Chief of the\r\nGovernment Survey and author of a \"Short History of the Hawaiian People\"\r\nand other works. The pamphlet has been planned, edited and in part\r\nwritten by Alatau T. Atkinson, Esq., ex-Inspector General of Schools,\r\nand now General Superintendent of Census.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands are situated in the North Pacific Ocean and lie\r\nbetween longitudes 154° 40' and 160° 30' West, and latitudes 22° 16' and\r\n18° 55' North. They are thus on the very edge of the tropics, but their\r\nposition in mid-ocean and the prevalence of the northeast trade wind\r\ngives them a climate unequalled by any other portion of the globe--a\r\nperpetual summer without an enervating heat. In the Hawaiian Islands\r\nAmericans and Europeans can and do work in the open air, at all seasons\r\nof the year, as they cannot in countries lying in the same latitudes\r\nelsewhere. To note an instance, Calcutta lies a little to the north of\r\nthe latitude of Kauai, our most northerly Island, and in Calcutta the\r\nAmerican and European can only work with his brain; hard physical labor\r\nhe cannot do and live. On the Hawaiian Islands he can work and thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall varies, being greater on the windward side of the Islands,\r\nand increasing up to a certain elevation. Thus, at Olaa, on the Island\r\nof Hawaii, windward side and elevation of about 2,000 feet, the rainfall\r\nfrom July 1st, 1894, to June 30, 1895, was 176.82 inches, while at\r\nKailua, on the leeward side, at a low level, it was only 51.21 inches\r\nduring the same period.\r\n\r\nThe temperature also varies according to elevation and position. On the\r\nIsland of Hawaii you can get any climate from the heat of summer to actual\r\nwinter at the summits of the two great mountains. A meteorological record,\r\nkept carefully for a period of twelve years, gives 89° as the highest and\r\n54° as the lowest temperature recorded, or a mean temperature of 71° 30'\r\nfor the year. A case of sunstroke has never been known. People make no\r\nspecial precautions against the sun, wearing straw and soft felt hats\r\nsimilar to those worn in the States during the summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDS.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds, as mentioned above, are the northeast trades.\r\nThese blow for about nine months of the year. The remainder of the\r\nperiod the winds are variable and chiefly from the south. The Islands\r\nare outside the cyclone belt, and severe storms accompanied by thunder\r\nand lightning are of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH.\r\n\r\nThe Islands possess a healthy climate. There are no virulent fevers such\r\nas are encountered on the coast of Africa or in the West India Islands.\r\nEpidemics seldom visit the Islands, and when they do they are generally\r\nlight. A careful system of quarantine guards the Islands now from\r\nepidemics from abroad. Such grave diseases as pneumonia and diphtheria\r\nare almost unknown. Children thrive wonderfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes--and these lines are written for practical\r\nmen--there are eight Islands in the Hawaiian group. The others are mere\r\nrocks, of no value to mankind at present. These eight Islands, beginning\r\nfrom the northwest, are named Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai,\r\nKahoolawe, Maui and Hawaii. The areas of these Islands are as follows:\r\n\r\n             =Square Miles.=\r\n\r\n  Niihau             97\r\n  Kauai             590\r\n  Oahu              600\r\n  Molokai           270\r\n  Maui              760\r\n  Lanai             150\r\n  Kahoolawe          63\r\n  Hawaii           4210\r\n                   ----\r\n  Total            6740\r\n\r\nThe Islands that interest an intending immigrant are Hawaii, Maui, Oahu\r\nand Kauai. It is on these Islands that coffee, fruits, potatoes, corn\r\nand vegetables can be raised by the small investor, and where land can\r\nbe obtained on reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWAII.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Hawaii is the largest in the group, and presents great\r\nvarieties of soil and climate. The windward side, which includes the\r\ndistricts of North Kohala, Hamakua, Hilo and Puna, is copiously watered\r\nby rains and, in the Hilo district, the streams rush impetuously down\r\nevery gulch or ravine. The leeward side of the Island, including South\r\nKohala, North and South Kona, and Kau, is not exposed to such strong\r\nrains, but an ample supply of water falls in the rain belt. The Kona\r\ndistrict has given the coffee product a name in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nOn this Island are now situated numerous sugar plantations. Coffee\r\nemploys the industry of several hundred owners, ranging from the man\r\nwith 200,000 trees to him who has only an acre or so. There are\r\nthousands upon thousands of acres at present uncultivated and only\r\nawaiting the sturdy arms and enterprising brains of the men of the\r\ntemperate zone to develop them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUI.\r\n\r\nMaui is also a very fine Island. Besides its sugar plantations, it has\r\nnumerous coffee lands, especially in the eastern part, which are just\r\nnow being opened up. The western slopes of Haleakala, the main mountain\r\nof Maui, are covered with small farms where are raised potatoes, corn,\r\nbeans and pigs. Again, here, thousands of acres are lying fallow.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOLULU.\r\n\r\nOn Oahu is the capital, Honolulu. It is a city numbering thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants and is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Island.\r\nThe city extends a considerable distance up Nuuanu Valley and has wings\r\nextending northwest and southeast. It is a city of foliage. Except in\r\nthe business blocks, every house stands in its own garden, and some of\r\nthe houses are wonderfully beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe city is lighted with electric light; there is a very complete\r\ntelephone system, and tram cars run at short intervals along the\r\nprincipal streets and continue out to a sea-bathing resort and public\r\npark, four miles from the city. There are numerous stores where all\r\nkinds of goods can be obtained. In this particular Honolulu occupies\r\na position ahead of any city of similar size. The public buildings\r\nare handsome and commodious. There are numerous churches, schools, a\r\npublic library of over 10,000 volumes, Y. M. C. A. Hall, Masonic Temple,\r\nOdd Fellows' Hall and Theater. There is frequent steam communication\r\nwith San Francisco, once a month with Victoria (British Columbia), and\r\ntwice a month with New Zealand and the Australian Colonies. Steamers\r\nalso connect Honolulu with China and Japan. There are three evening\r\ndaily papers published in English, one daily morning paper, and two\r\nweeklies. Besides these there are papers published in the Hawaiian,\r\nPortuguese, Japanese and Chinese languages, and also monthly magazines\r\nin various tongues.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAHU'S OPPORTUNITIES.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Oahu presents excellent opportunities for the investor.\r\nAcres upon acres of land remain undeveloped among its teeming valleys,\r\nthe energies and wealth of the population having been devoted to the\r\ndevelopment of the sugar lands on the larger Islands.\r\n\r\nA line of railroad has been constructed which at present runs along the\r\ncoast to a distance of thirty miles from the city. It is proposed to\r\ncontinue this line completely around the Island. This railroad opens up\r\nrich coffee and farming lands and affords ready means of transport for\r\nthe produce, and an expeditious method for obtaining the necessary\r\nsupplies, etc., from the capital. The management of the railroad offers\r\nspecial inducements for would-be investors to see the country, and\r\nspecial rates should they conclude to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUAI.\r\n\r\nKauai is called the \"Garden Island,\" it is so well watered and so\r\nluxuriant in vegetation. The Island is at present largely devoted to the\r\ncultivation of sugar. Rice also cuts a considerable figure in the\r\nagricultural production of Kauai. That it can produce coffee is\r\nundoubted, but there is a timidity about embarking in the industry,\r\nbecause some forty years ago the experiment of a coffee plantation was\r\ntried, and owing to misjudgment of location and soil, failed. Since then\r\nthe cultivation of coffee has come to be more thoroughly understood, and\r\nthere is no doubt that quantities of land suitable for such cultivation\r\nare now lying, like the sleeping beauty, waiting for the kiss of\r\nenterprise to make them awake into usefulness and profit for mankind.\r\n\r\nThere is room on the Hawaiian Islands for at least ten times the present\r\npopulation. The climate, soil and social conditions all tend to make\r\nthem a desirable home for those who are willing to work, and have a\r\nmoderate capital to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Hawaiian Islands is a Republic. Up to the year\r\n1893 it had been a limited monarchy, but at that date it was felt, by\r\nthe progressive party in the state, that monarchy had had its day, and\r\nthat the friends of such a form of government should give way to more\r\nliberal institutions, assimilating to the institutions of the United\r\nStates, and to become a part of which Great Republic is the earnest\r\ndesire of all those who have the interests of the Islands at heart. The\r\nmonarchy, in a bloodless revolution, disappeared and the Republic took\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe Republic is a republic of progress, and under the Government thus\r\nestablished every facility has been given for developing and improving\r\nthe country. The President is elected for six years. The Legislature\r\nconsists of a Senate and House of Representatives, all members being\r\nelected by popular vote. The Senators are elected for a term of six\r\nyears, and voters for Senators must have real property worth $1,500, or\r\npersonal property worth $3,000, or an income of not less than $600 per\r\nannum. The vote for Representatives is based on manhood suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION.\r\n\r\nAll males between the ages of 20 and 60 pay a personal tax of $5, viz:\r\nPoll tax, $1; road tax, $2; school tax, $2. Land pays a tax of one per\r\ncent. on the cash value, and personal property a similar rate. Carts pay\r\n$2, brakes $3, carriages $5, dogs $1, female dogs $3. From the above it\r\nwill be seen that the taxes are not heavy as compared with other\r\ncountries; moreover, there are no local taxes of any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ACQUIRING LAND.\r\n\r\nLand can be obtained from the Government by two methods, viz.; The cash\r\nfreehold system, and the right of purchase leases. Under the first\r\nsystem the land is sold at auction. The purchaser pays one-quarter in\r\ncash and the rest in equal installments of one, two and three years,\r\ninterest being charged at the rate of six per cent. upon the unpaid\r\nbalance. Under this system the purchaser is bound to maintain a home on\r\nthe land from the commencement of the second year to the end of the\r\nthird. The right of purchase leases are drawn for twenty-one years at a\r\nrental of eight per cent. on the appraised value of the land. The lessee\r\nhas the privilege of purchasing the land, after the third year, _at the\r\noriginal appraised value_, provided 25 per cent. of the land is reduced\r\nto cultivation, and other conditions of the lease filled. In this case a\r\nhome must be maintained from the end of the first year to the end of the\r\nfifth year. The limit of first-class agricultural land obtainable is 100\r\nacres. This amount is increased on lands of inferior quality. Under the\r\nabove conditions the applicant must be 18 years of age and obtain\r\nspecial letters of denization. Land can also be obtained from the\r\nvarious land and investment companies, and from private parties. The\r\nfull land law will be treated of in Chapter VI. of this pamphlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTIVE BUILDING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDICIARY BUILDING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICIARY, POLICE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThere is a thoroughly efficient judiciary consisting of a Supreme Court,\r\nfive Circuit Courts in which trials by jury are conducted, and District\r\nCourts in every district. The higher courts are presided over by well\r\ntrained, educated men. There is an efficient police force in every part\r\nof the group. The inhabitants are law-abiding and crimes of violence are\r\nvery rare. There is very little petty theft, and even in Honolulu, the\r\ngreatest center of population and a seaport town, many of the houses are\r\nleft with doors unlocked at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent system of free public schools taught in the\r\nEnglish language, the teachers in many cases being imported from the\r\nUnited States. The main plan of the system is modelled upon the public\r\nschool system of the United States, modified to meet the wants of a\r\nheterogeneous population. The children are instructed in writing,\r\nreading, composition, arithmetic, geography, both local and general. The\r\nbooks are uniform and obtainable at the same price as in the United\r\nStates. The schools are strictly non-sectarian. There is no district,\r\nhowever remote, in which there is no school. The only people who cannot\r\nread and write are those who come from abroad. Those born in the Islands\r\nare compelled by law to take advantage of the education offered. Besides\r\nthe common school education, opportunities are given at various centers\r\nfor a higher education equivalent to the grammar grade of the United\r\nStates, and in Honolulu a high school and collegiate course can be\r\nobtained at a small cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThe various Christian denominations are represented and all forms are\r\ntolerated. The country churches of the Protestant denominations are\r\nchiefly conducted by Hawaiian pastors, the Roman Catholic by French and\r\nGerman priests, who are mostly good linguists and speak Hawaiian,\r\nEnglish and Portuguese, besides their mother tongue. Wherever there is a\r\nlarge collection of English speaking people a Protestant church is\r\nusually supported by them. In Honolulu there is a large number of\r\nchurches, Congregational, Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Methodist and\r\nMormon. There is a Sunday law, and all work which is not absolutely\r\nnecessary is prohibited on that day. Rational outdoor amusement is not\r\nprohibited, such as riding, boating, shooting, etc., and the Government\r\nBand plays at the public park at Waikiki every Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nIn every district of the Islands the Government supports a doctor, who\r\ngives his services to indigent Hawaiians free of charge--others have to\r\npay. In many places there are physicians settled who carry on a private\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONES.\r\n\r\nThe Islands of Oahu, Kauai and Hawaii have telephones to every\r\naccessible point. The rent of the instrument is moderate, and a small\r\ncharge is made for those who do not care or cannot afford to possess an\r\ninstrument of their own. On Maui the telephone is at present established\r\nonly in part.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nCommunication between the Islands is by steamer; of these some seventeen\r\nare constantly plying from port to port, affording weekly communication\r\nwith the capital. The regular passenger steamers are well fitted with\r\ncabins, have electric bells and electric lights and all modern\r\naccommodations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTAL MATTERS.\r\n\r\nThere is a regular postal system, and on the arrival of a steamer at\r\nany main point, mail carriers at once start out to distribute the\r\nmail through the district. The Hawaiian Islands belong to the Postal\r\nUnion, and money orders can be obtained to the United States, Canada,\r\nGreat Britain, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,\r\nPortugal, Hong Kong and Colony of Victoria, as well as local orders\r\nbetween the Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe mainstay of the Hawaiian Islands has, for the last thirty-five\r\nyears, been the sugar industry. From this source a large amount of\r\nwealth has been accumulated. But the sugar industry requires large\r\ncapital for expensive machinery, and has never proved remunerative to\r\nsmall investors. An attempt has been made at profit-sharing and has met\r\nwith some success, the small farmer cultivating and the capitalist\r\ngrinding at a central mill. Of late years, moreover, the small farmer\r\nhas been steadily developing in the Hawaiian Islands and attention has\r\nbeen given to other products than sugar.\r\n\r\nRice, neither the European nor the American can cultivate as laborers.\r\nIt requires working in marshy land, and though on the Islands it yields\r\ntwo crops a year, none but the Chinaman can raise it successfully. A\r\ndry-land or mountain rice has been introduced, which will be treated\r\nunder the head of Agricultural possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe main staple after sugar and rice is coffee. Of this hundreds of\r\nthousands of trees have been planted out within the last five years.\r\nThis is essentially the crop of the future and bids fair to become as\r\nimportant a staple as sugar. Coffee does not require the amount of\r\ncapital that sugar does, and it can be worked remuneratively upon a\r\nsmall area. It is estimated that at the end of the fourth year the\r\nreturn from a 75-acre coffee plantation will much more than pay the\r\nrunning expenses, while from that time on a return of from eight to ten\r\nthousand dollars per annum may be realized.\r\n\r\nOn page 32 will be found an estimate of the cost of establishing a\r\n75-acre coffee plantation from the first to the seventh year.\r\n\r\nFruits can also be cultivated to advantage. At present the banana trade\r\nof the Islands amounts to over 100,000 bunches per annum, valued at over\r\n$100,000, and the quantity might be very easily quadrupled. The banana\r\nindustry may be regarded as in its infancy. The export of the fruit is\r\nonly from the Island of Oahu, but there are thousands of acres on the\r\nother Islands of the group which could be profitably used for this\r\ncultivation and for nothing else. The whole question of the banana\r\nindustry hinges on the market. At present the market is limited.\r\n\r\nLimes and oranges can be cultivated and the fruit can be easily packed\r\nfor export; at present the production does not meet the local market.\r\nThe fruits can be raised to perfection. The Hawaiian orange has a fine\r\nflavor and the Hawaiian lime has an aroma and flavor far superior to\r\nthat cultivated in Mexico and Central America. In the uplands of Hawaii\r\nand Maui potatoes can be and are raised. Their quality is good. Corn is\r\nalso raised. In these industries many Portuguese, Norwegians and others\r\nhave embarked. Both these products find an ample local market. The corn\r\nis used largely for feed on the plantations. The corn is ground with the\r\ncob and makes an excellent feed for working cattle, horses and mules.\r\n\r\nIn the uplands, where the climate is temperate, as at Waimea, Hawaii,\r\nvegetables of all kinds can be raised; excellent cauliflowers, cabbages\r\nand every product of the temperate zone can be grown to perfection.\r\n\r\nCattle raising in so small a place as the Hawaiian Islands does not\r\npresent great opportunities except for local consumption. Pigs are\r\nprofitable to the small farmer. In the Kula district of Maui pigs are\r\nfattened upon the corn and potatoes raised in the district. The price of\r\npork, dressed, is 25 cents per pound in Honolulu and about 15 cents per\r\npound in the outside districts. The Chinese, of whom there are some\r\n15,000 resident on the various Islands, are extremely fond of pork, so\r\nthat there is a large local market, which has to be supplemented by\r\nimportations from California.\r\n\r\nAttention has lately been given to fiber plants, for which there are\r\nmany suitable locations. Ramie grows luxuriantly, but the lack of proper\r\ndecorticating and cleaning machinery has prevented any advance in this\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nSisal hemp and Sansevieria have been experimented with, but without any\r\ndistinct influence upon the trade output.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of pineapples is a very growing industry. In 1895 pines\r\nwere exported from the Islands to San Francisco to the value of nearly\r\n$9,000. This has grown up in the last half dozen years. There is every\r\nreason to think that canning pineapples for the Coast and other markets\r\ncan be made profitable.\r\n\r\nThe guava, which grows wild, can also be put up to profit, for the\r\nmanufacture of guava jelly. It has never been entered upon on a large\r\nscale, but to the thrifty farmer it would add a convenient slice to his\r\nincome, just as the juice of the maple adds an increase to the farmer of\r\nthe Eastern States. Well made guava jelly will find a market anywhere.\r\nIn England it is regarded as a great delicacy, being imported from the\r\nWest India Islands. Besides the guava there are other fruits which can\r\nbe put up to commercial profit, notably the poha or Cape gooseberry\r\n(Physalis Edulis). This has been successfully made into jams and jelly,\r\nwhich command an extensive local sale and should find their way into\r\nlarger markets.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, outside the great industries of sugar, coffee and\r\nrice, there is a good field for many minor industries which can be\r\ncarried on with profit by those who know what work is, and are willing\r\nto put their shoulders to the wheel.\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaiian Islands a simple life can be lived, and entering\r\ngradually upon the coffee industry, a good competence can be obtained\r\nlong before such could be realized by the agriculturalist elsewhere.\r\nHowever, it is useless to come to the Islands without the necessary\r\ncapital to develop the land that can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBetween arriving and the time that the crops begin to give returns there\r\nis a period where the living must be close, and cash must be paid out\r\nfor the necessary improvements. The land is here, the climate is here;\r\nit only requires brains, a small capital and energy to realize such\r\ncomfort and independence as can not be realized in old countries, in\r\none-fourth of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE.\r\n\r\nThe most promising of all the Island products, outside of sugar, is\r\ncoffee. No finer coffee in the world is produced than that of the\r\nHawaiian Islands. It requires care and does not produce a crop until the\r\nthird year, but it remains till the fifth year to make a proper\r\nrealization upon the investment. It is evidently necessary to give a\r\nvery full description of the coffee plant and its method of culture to\r\nassure intending immigrants of what is before them.\r\n\r\nCoffee is a shrub belonging to the family of the Rubiaceae. Botanists\r\ndivide it into many species, but it can be practically divided into two\r\nsections, Arabian coffee and Liberian coffee, or in point of fact,\r\nAsiatic and African. In the Hawaiian Islands coffee grows best between\r\n500 and 2,000 feet above the sea level, though there are cases in which\r\nit has done well close to the sea. It requires a loose porous soil and\r\ndoes not thrive well in heavy clayey ground which holds much water. Of\r\nsuch heavy land there is very little in the Hawaiian Islands. The soil\r\nis generally very porous.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that coffee will thrive and give good results in\r\nvarying conditions of soil and degrees of heat. In these Islands it grows\r\nand produces from very nearly at the sea level to the elevation of 2,600\r\nfeet. The highest elevation of bearing coffee, known here, is twenty-five\r\nmiles from the town of Hilo and in the celebrated Olaa district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EWA MILL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VALLEY SCENE, HAWAII.]\r\n\r\nWith such a range it is evident that, in a tropical climate, the\r\ncultivation of coffee presents greater opportunities for an investor\r\nthan other tropical products.\r\n\r\nFor years it was thought that coffee would only grow to advantage in the\r\nKona district of Hawaii. Practical experiment has shown that it can be\r\ngrown with success in almost any part of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe opening up of the Olaa portion of the Puna district, by a well\r\nmacadamized road leading from Hilo to the Volcano, may be regarded as\r\nthe commencement of the coffee industry on a large scale on the Hawaiian\r\nIslands. There are now over fifty plantations where six years ago there\r\nwas nothing but tangled and dense forest. The Olaa land is Government\r\nproperty and can be acquired under the land law. There are still 10,000\r\nacres not taken up. The location is very desirable as there is direct\r\ncommunication with Hilo by an excellent road and the crop can be readily\r\ntaken to the shipping point. Indeed it can not be long before a railroad\r\nwill be built; when this takes place a far larger extent of land will be\r\navailable for coffee growing in this section of the country. The soil in\r\nthe Olaa district is deep and wonderfully prolific.\r\n\r\nOther portions of Puna also present many fertile lands, and coffee\r\nplantations in those parts are coming to the front showing excellent\r\nresults. A considerable number of investors have opened up coffee\r\nplantations in them, all of which are doing excellently. These\r\nplantations, to the knowledge of the writer are, many of them, carried\r\non out of the savings made by workers in Honolulu, who are thus\r\npreparing for themselves a provision for their early middle age. On the\r\nIsland of Hawaii are the great coffee districts of Olaa, Puna, Kona and\r\nHamakua, in each of which thriving coffee plantations are established,\r\nwhile tens of thousands of acres of the very finest lands are yet\r\nundisturbed. Government lands in these districts are being opened up for\r\nsettlement as fast as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\nOn the Island of Maui there is a large area of splendid coffee lands.\r\nThe extensive land of Keanae belonging to the Government will be opened\r\nfor settlement as soon as the preliminary work of surveying is completed.\r\n\r\nOn the Island of Molokai the industry is making progress and there are\r\nseveral plantations along the leeward valleys.\r\n\r\nSo also on the Island of Oahu there is much good coffee land, which is\r\nbeing experimented upon, and considerable capital invested in the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAs the case now stands for the investor, land can be obtained for coffee\r\ngrowing in:--\r\n\r\n  ISLAND OF HAWAII.\r\n      North and South Kona,\r\n      Hilo,\r\n      Puna, including Olaa,\r\n      Hamakua.\r\n\r\n  ISLAND OF MAUI.\r\n      Keanae,\r\n      Nahiku,\r\n      Lahaina,\r\n      Kaupo.\r\n\r\n  ISLAND OF MOLOKAI.\r\n\r\n  ISLAND OF OAHU.\r\n\r\n  ISLAND OF KAUAI.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large tracts of Government lands on Hawaii and Maui,\r\nthere are many fine tracts of first-class coffee lands owned or\r\ncontrolled by private parties. It is the policy of the Government to\r\nencourage the settlement of its lands by small farmers. Hence the amount\r\nof land, granted to one party or that one party can take up, while amply\r\nsufficient to enable one person or family, with honest endeavor, to\r\nacquire an independence, is not large enough to offer inducements for\r\nthe employment of large amounts of capital.\r\n\r\nThat areas of land, for the establishment of large coffee plantations,\r\ncan be acquired is reasonably certain as large owners are evincing a\r\ndisposition to sell and lease their lands.\r\n\r\nThere is no agricultural investment that offers better opportunities for\r\nthe profitable employment of capital, than a well managed coffee estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF THE COFFEE TREE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the best results the coffee tree requires to be\r\nproperly planted, and during its life time needs frequent and\r\nintelligent cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe various operations incidental to the opening and carrying on of a\r\ncoffee plantation will be taken up in their proper order and described\r\nin as plain language as possible, and as briefly as is consistent with a\r\nclear explanation of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing the planter should do after obtaining possession of\r\nhis land is to plant a nursery, so that he may have, as soon as\r\npossible, an abundant supply of strong healthy plants. Many planters\r\nhave planted their fields with wild stumps, these are young coffee\r\nplants that are found under wild growths of coffee trees. The young\r\ntrees are cut off about six inches above the ground, they are then taken\r\nup and the lateral roots trimmed close to the tap root. The thready end\r\nof the tap root is cut off and the stump is ready to plant. In some\r\ncases the young plants are taken up, from under the wild trees, and\r\nplanted just as they are. This method can be dismissed at once as the\r\nworst possible method of planting the coffee tree. The very best plants\r\nare strong healthy nursery plants, that is, plants that have been grown\r\nfrom the best seed in a properly prepared nursery. The next best plants\r\nto use are nursery stumps. These are nursery trees that have grown too\r\nlarge to safely transplant. By cutting them down and trimming the roots\r\nthey can be safely transplanted to the field, where they will grow into\r\ngood healthy trees. Stumps soon after planting send up several shoots,\r\nthese, with the exception of the strongest one, are taken off. This\r\nlatter shoot is to grow and make the coffee trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING THE NURSERY.\r\n\r\nThe size of the nursery will depend on how large the plantation is to\r\nbe. For a 75-acre plantation, one acre of ground will more than supply\r\nall the plants required. It is always desirable to have a greater number\r\nof plants than is needed to just plant the acreage the plantation is to\r\nbe, for after the fields are planted some of the plants may get injured\r\nfrom dry weather and require replacing with plants from the nursery. Any\r\nsurplus left, after the trees in the fields are well established, can be\r\nsold to some later planter, who will find it to his advantage to\r\npurchase good nursery plants for his first planting and thereby save one\r\nyear of time. It is advisable for all planters to buy plants for their\r\nfirst planting, but for the second year's planting they should have a\r\nnursery of their own from which they can select the strongest and most\r\nforward plants.\r\n\r\nThe land for the nursery should be selected as close as possible to\r\nwhere the plantation is to be. It should be on a slight slope to insure\r\ndrainage, and free from rocks and stones. The soil should be ploughed or\r\ndug over to the depth of one foot and made as fine as possible. Beds\r\nshould be thrown up six inches high and three feet wide. The surface of\r\nthe beds should be made quite smooth and level; the seeds should be\r\nplanted six inches apart and three quarters of an inch deep. A good way\r\nto ensure even and regular planting is to make a frame three feet wide\r\neach way. Pegs, three quarters of an inch long and five eighths of an\r\ninch diameter, should be fastened to one side of the frame, placing\r\nthem exactly six inches apart. The frame, thus prepared, is placed, pegs\r\ndown, on the bed. A slight pressure will sink the pegs into the soil.\r\nThe frame is now lifted and you have the holes for the seeds all of one\r\ndepth and equi-distant from each other. The seeds can now be dropped one\r\nin each hole. The seeds should be placed flat side down, and covered by\r\nbrushing over the surface of the bed. If the weather is at all dry it is\r\na good plan to mulch the surface of the bed with dry grass or fern\r\nleaves. The soil should be kept moist, and if there is not sufficient\r\nrain the beds must be watered. In six or seven weeks the seeds should\r\nsprout and show above ground. The mulching should now be moved from over\r\nthe plants and arranged in the rows. It has been the practice of some\r\nplanters to plant the seed much closer than six inches apart, but it\r\nwill be found that plants at six inches apart can be more easily and\r\nsafely transplanted than from close planted beds. It will be advisable\r\nin taking up plants from the beds, to take only every other one, this\r\nwill give the remaining plants more room to develop and grow more stocky\r\nthan would be the case if all the plants were taken up from each bed as\r\nthey were required.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARING THE LAND.\r\n\r\nThe next thing for the planter to do is to get his land cleared. This\r\ncan be done more satisfactorily and cheaply by contract than can be done\r\nby days' work. Gangs of Chinese and Japanese undertake the clearing of\r\nland and will make a contract to clear the land as per specification. In\r\nthe Olaa District land costs from $20 to $50 per acre to clear,\r\naccording to the kind of clearing done. The land is forest land and some\r\nplanters have the trees cut down and everything burned making the land\r\nquite clear, while others just have the vines and ferns cut and the\r\ntrees felled, leaving everything on the land to rot. This method while\r\ncosting much less than burning up everything, makes it more expensive to\r\nlay out and plant the land. The planter must decide for himself which of\r\nthe two methods he will pursue. However, it can be said in the case of\r\nthose who only cut and fell, in a few years everything, trees, vines and\r\nferns rot down and greatly increase the fertility of the soil. The next\r\nthing is to lay out the land for the digging of the holes where it is\r\nintended to set out the young trees. There is a wide diversity of\r\nopinion as to the proper distance apart to plant coffee trees. From\r\n10x12 feet down to 5x6 and all intermediate distances are practiced. It\r\nis a significant fact that planters who formerly planted their trees at\r\nthe wider distances are now setting out trees as close as 6x5. Trees\r\nplanted 6x6 will probably yield better results per acre than trees\r\nplanted at a wider or closer distance. Having fixed upon the distance\r\napart the trees are to be planted, the planter proceeds to mark with\r\npegs the places where he wants the holes dug. This is usually done with\r\na line or rope that has pieces of red rag fastened in the strands, at\r\nthe distance apart at which it is intended to dig the holes. The line is\r\ndrawn tightly across one end of the clearing and a peg driven into the\r\nsoil at every place that is marked on the line. The men, holding the two\r\nends of the line, are each provided with a stick the exact length that\r\nthe rows are to be apart. After one row is pegged, the line is advanced\r\none length of the stick and the operation repeated until the whole\r\nclearing is pegged. After the first line is pegged a line should be laid\r\nat exactly right angles to the first line so that the rows will be\r\nstraight both ways. The pegging being completed, the holes should be dug\r\nnot less than 18 inches wide and 18 inches deep. The top soil should be\r\ncarefully placed on one side of the hole and the subsoil on the other,\r\nthe holes should remain open as long as possible and should only be\r\nfilled in a week or so before planting the trees. The bottoms of the\r\nholes should be explored with a light crowbar and, if any rocks or\r\nstones are found, they should be removed. In filling the holes the top\r\nsoil (that has been placed on one side) should be placed in the bottom\r\nof the hole and other top soil should be taken from between the rows\r\nuntil the hole is full, the subsoil can now be disposed of by scattering\r\nit between the rows. The holes after filling should have the marking\r\npegs replaced in the center of the filling, this will serve as a guide\r\nfor planting the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\nThere is no operation in all the work of establishing a coffee\r\nplantation that requires such careful supervision as that of planting\r\nout the young trees. If the work is carelessly done and the slender tap\r\nroot is doubled up or, if it is shortened too much, the tree will never\r\nthrive. It may grow fairly well for a time, perhaps until the time for\r\nthe first crop, then the foliage will turn yellow and the tree show\r\nevery sign of decay. The effort to produce a crop is too much for the\r\ntree and the sooner it is pulled up and replaced by a properly planted\r\ntree the better.\r\n\r\nThe closest supervision is necessary in order that the planter may be\r\ncertain that the tap roots are placed perfectly straight in the ground;\r\nand the lateral roots placed in a natural position. In order to effect\r\nthis, with the least amount of trouble, transplanters have been used. A\r\ntransplanter that has been used with success is made as follows: two\r\npieces of sheet iron (galvanized) are bent into two half circles, which,\r\nwhen placed together, form a cylinder 3 inches in diameter and seven\r\ninches long. A piece of hoop iron is bent to a ring, that will fit over\r\nthe cylinder, and riveted. The mode of using is as follows: The two\r\nhalves of the cylinder are pressed into the ground, one on each side of\r\nthe young coffee tree. They are pressed down until the upper ends are\r\nlevel with the surface of the soil. The hoop iron ring is then\r\npressed over the ends of the two halves of the cylinder, binding them\r\nfirmly together. The cylinder can now be lifted from the ground bringing\r\nwith it the young tree with all its roots in the position in which they\r\ngrew. In this condition the young trees are carried to the field and,\r\nthe holes being opened, the cylinder, holding the tree, is placed in the\r\nground and the soil packed firmly around it. The hoop iron ring is then\r\nremoved and the two halves of the cylinder withdrawn. The soil is again\r\ncompacted around the roots and the tree is planted. There is another\r\ntransplanter, invented in America, that would probably be better and\r\nmore economical in working than the one described above. This\r\ntransplanter consists of a cylinder of thin sheet steel. These are made\r\nin America of various sizes to suit different kinds of trees. For a\r\ncoffee tree a good size would be 7 inches long and 5 inches in diameter.\r\nThe cylinder has an opening, five-eighths of an inch wide, running the\r\nwhole length of the cylinder and exactly opposite this opening a handle\r\nis riveted. This handle is of half inch round iron, 18 inches long with\r\na cross bar on top. The rod is bent outward in the form of a bow, so\r\nthat in working, the branches of the young tree may not be injured. The\r\nmode of working the transplanter is as follows: the cylinder is placed\r\non the ground with the tree in the center of the cylinder. This can be\r\ndone by allowing the stem of the young tree to pass through the slot in\r\nthe cylinder. Then, by means of the cross handle, the cylinder is turned\r\nand pressed into the soil until the upper end is level with the surface\r\nof the ground. Then, by lifting on the stem of the tree and the handle\r\nof the transplanter at the same time, the tree is taken from the ground\r\nwith its roots undisturbed. Should the end of the tap root project below\r\nthe end of the cylinder, the thready end should be pinched off with the\r\nthumb nail. By placing the lower end of the cylinder on the bottom of a\r\nbox and inserting a wedge-shaped piece of wood in the slot, the cylinder\r\nis sprung open and can be withdrawn, leaving the young tree, with a\r\ncylinder of earth around its roots, standing on the bottom of the box.\r\nThis operation can be repeated until the box is full of the young trees,\r\nwhen it is carried to the field and the trees placed one at each hole.\r\nBy using a duplicate transplanter a cylinder of earth is removed from\r\nthe spot where the tree is to be placed, and the tree with its cylinder\r\nof earth is placed in the round hole, which it exactly fits, the earth\r\nbeing slightly compacted around the roots. The tree is thus planted with\r\nthe absolute certainty that the roots are in their natural position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUOA VALLEY RICE FIELDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINEAPPLE PLANTATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe old adage, \"a stitch in time saves nine,\" will bear its fullest\r\napplication in the care and weeding of a coffee estate. From the time\r\nthe land is first cleared, weeding should commence, and it is\r\nastonishing how little it will cost if care is taken that no weed be\r\nallowed to run to seed. The bulk of Hawaiian coffee lands is situated in\r\nthe forests where the land is covered with a dense undergrowth of ferns\r\nand vines and there are no pernicious weeds to bother. But soon after\r\nclearing, the seeds of weeds are dropped by the birds and are carried in\r\non the feet and clothing of the laborers and visitors. We have no weeds\r\nthat run to seed in less than thirty days, and if the fields are gone\r\nover, once a month, and any weed that can be found pulled up and buried,\r\nthe work of weeding will be reduced to a minimum. But if the weeds, that\r\nare bound to spring up, are allowed to run to seed, the work of weeding\r\nwill be greatly increased and will require the labor of a large gang to\r\nkeep the fields in order. If taken in time, the labor of one man will\r\nkeep from 15 to 25 acres quite clean. During the first year after\r\nsetting out the fields, all that is required is to keep the fields clear\r\nof weeds and the replacing, with a healthy tree from the nursery, any\r\ntree that from any cause looks sickly and does not come along well.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that in parts of the field some trees, while looking\r\nhealthy, do not grow as fast as the average of the trees, this is often\r\ndue to the soil not being of as good a quality. Knolls and side hills\r\nare not generally so rich as the hollows and valleys, and the coffee\r\ntrees, planted in the poorest parts of the field, should be fertilized\r\nuntil they are as vigorous as the trees in the best parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING.\r\n\r\nDuring the second year the young trees will have begun to make a good\r\ngrowth and will require handling. In order to make clear the description\r\nof the operations of handling and pruning, it may be well to describe\r\nhere the component parts of the coffee tree.\r\n\r\nThe underground portion consists of a tap root and numerous lateral or\r\nside roots. The parts above ground consist of:\r\n\r\n1st. The stem or trunk.\r\n\r\n2d. The primaries or first branches; these grow from the trunk in pairs\r\nat intervals of from two to four inches, the two primaries, making a\r\npair, grow one opposite to the other, the pair above radiating out at a\r\ndifferent angle and so on to the top of the tree.\r\n\r\n3rd. The secondaries; these are the branches that grow in pairs from the\r\nprimaries.\r\n\r\n4th. The tertiaries; these are the third branches that grow in pairs\r\nfrom the secondaries in the same manner as the secondaries grow on the\r\nprimaries.\r\n\r\n5th. The leaves that grow on all the branches.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the second year, the field should be gone over at\r\nleast every two months and all the secondaries that make their\r\nappearance should be rubbed off; this can be done by a touch of the\r\nfingers, if the secondaries are not more than two or three inches long.\r\nIf allowed to grow longer, the knife must be used, or there is danger\r\nof tearing out the eye or bud, which we depend upon for growing new\r\nsecondaries at the proper time. During the second year, the secondaries\r\nwill make their appearance only on the lower sets of primaries, the\r\nupper sets as they grow being too young to grow secondaries. At the\r\nbeginning of the third year all the secondaries should be allowed to\r\ngrow till they attain a length of six inches; then the trees should be\r\ncarefully gone over and all but five of the secondaries on each primary\r\ncut off with a sharp pruning knife. No pairs should be left, and only\r\nthe strongest and most vigorous should be retained. They should be\r\ndisposed on alternate sides of the primary and none left in a space of\r\nsix inches from the stem of the tree. The object of this is to allow the\r\nlight to penetrate to the center of the tree, for the coffee tree bears\r\nfruit in greater profusion on branches that are exposed to the light\r\nthan on those that are shaded.\r\n\r\nDuring this third year the tree will blossom and bear the first or\r\nmaiden crop. In some cases the tree will blossom in the second year, but\r\nit is a wise plan to rub all the blossoms off, as it only weakens the\r\ntree to bear a crop at such an early age. It is of the utmost importance\r\nthat in the first crop, as well as in all future crops, the tree should\r\nnot be overburdened with a superabundance of growing wood. If left to\r\nitself, the lower primaries will grow a mass of secondaries, so much so\r\nthat no blossom will set on them, and the first crop will come only on\r\nthe upper primaries, and be only a third or fourth of the crop that\r\nwould be produced if the trees were properly handled. By handling, as\r\ndescribed above, the tree is relieved of all superfluous wood and only\r\nsuch secondaries are left as are needed to bear the fourth year's crop,\r\nand the maiden crop will grow on the primaries. It may be well to\r\nmention here, that coffee only grows on wood of the second year's\r\ngrowth, and does not grow on the same wood twice.\r\n\r\nDuring the third year, the secondaries will come on the upper primaries.\r\nWhen they are well set, they should be reduced in number and in no case\r\nshould more than five be left to grow. In some cases four or even three\r\nwill be sufficient. Whatever the number that may be left, it must be\r\nunderstood that these are the branches that will bear the crop for the\r\nfourth year. During the third year new secondaries will grow from the\r\nplaces where the former secondaries grew. Sometimes two will grow from\r\none bud, they should all be removed, the trees being gone over two\r\nmonths, but at the last handling before blossoming time, which varies\r\ngreatly with the elevation above sea level, enough of these new\r\nsecondaries should be left to make wood for the fifth year's crop. From\r\nthis time on the coffee planter should be able to point out the wood on\r\nwhich the present and the next year's crop will be borne, and it is this\r\nwood and that only, that should be allowed to grow. All other shoots,\r\nsuckers, etc., should be rubbed off each time the tree is handled,\r\nprovision being made each year for the wood for the crop two years hence.\r\n\r\nDuring the third year, the trees will require topping. As to the height\r\nat which a coffee tree should be topped, there is a great diversity of\r\nopinion. Some planters advocate topping as low as four and a half feet,\r\nothers at six or seven feet; as a matter of fact the coffee tree will\r\nbear fruit if topped as low as one and one half feet or if not topped at\r\nall. The only valid reason for topping as low as four and a half feet is\r\nfor the convenience of picking the crop. Five and a half or six feet is\r\na good height to top a coffee tree on the rich lands of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands. In fact the planters should not be guided by the number of\r\nfeet, but by the number of primaries he desires the tree to carry.\r\nEighteen to twenty pairs are a reasonable number for a coffee tree to\r\ncarry in this country, and it will be found that by not counting those\r\nprimaries that grow on the stem within fifteen inches from the ground,\r\neighteen or twenty pairs of primaries will come on the stem within six\r\nfeet from the ground. Before topping the tree, it should be allowed to\r\ngrow somewhat higher that it is intended to top, so that the wood may be\r\nhardened and not decay as it sometimes does if topped when the wood is\r\ntoo young. Topping is performed by cutting off the top of the tree at a\r\npoint an inch above a pair of primaries. Both primaries should also be\r\ncut off an inch from the stem. This will leave the top in the form of a\r\ncross; a knot will form at this point from which the tree will\r\nconstantly send up shoots striving to make a new top. These should be\r\ntorn off every time the tree is handled.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the time when the tree is bearing the first or\r\nmaiden crop. Through careful handling the tree has been divested of all\r\nsuperfluous shoots, branches, etc., and the crop is maturing on the\r\nprimaries. If the trees are situated on good rich soil, and the trees\r\nare well grown, there should be at least thirteen pairs of primaries\r\nbearing crop. At an average of fifty berries to each primary there will\r\nbe a yield of over one and a quarter pounds of clean coffee to the tree.\r\nThis yield for the first crop has been much exceeded in this country,\r\nbut it can only be assured by careful cultivation and handling as\r\ndescribed in this paper.\r\n\r\nWe will now take a look at the condition of our three years old trees.\r\nThey have all been topped and are carrying from thirty-six to forty\r\nprimaries, of which all except the upper six or eight are carrying four\r\nor five secondaries that are well advanced and which will bear the crop\r\nfor the fourth year. There will also be four or five secondaries, that\r\nare one or two months old, which are intended to bear the fifth year's\r\ncrop. All other growth should be removed as before up to the time of\r\nblossoming for the fourth year's crop. This may be estimated as follows:\r\nThere should be at least twenty-four primaries that have on each of them\r\nsay, four bearing secondaries. At thirty berries to each secondary, the\r\nyield would be close to three pounds of clean coffee to each tree. This\r\nagain has been exceeded in this country for four year old trees, but it\r\nmust be borne in mind, that in order to obtain these results, proper\r\ncultivation, handling and pruning must be done. Without proper care such\r\nresults would be impossible, the coffee cannot grow an abundance of wood\r\nand coffee at the same time. As soon as the crop of the fourth year is\r\ngathered the work of pruning must commence without delay. This consists\r\nof cutting off with a sharp knife the secondaries that have borne the\r\ncrop. They must not be cut so close as to injure the eye or bud. About\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch from the stem of the primary will be quite\r\nsafe, and the secondaries for the fifth year's crop will soon make their\r\nappearance. Care should be taken to leave the stem of the tree clear of\r\nshoots and foliage for a space of six inches from the stem; the tree\r\nwill want all the light it can get. The coffee tree can be said to be in\r\nfull bearing when all the primaries are carrying bearing secondaries.\r\nDuring the life of the coffee tree, the planter must keep a close watch\r\non his trees and restrict their wood-bearing propensities to the wood\r\nthat is to bear his crops; nothing else should be allowed to grow. If\r\nthe work is commenced rightly and carried on systematically, the work\r\nwill not be difficult and no crops will be lost. But on the other hand,\r\nif the work is neglected, the trees will become matted and all the lower\r\nprimaries die off. These, if once lost, will not grow again. The tree\r\nunder these conditions will only bear a tithe of the crop it would bear\r\nwith proper attention, and furthermore it is a most difficult matter to\r\nbring a neglected tree into proper shape and it can only be done at a\r\nloss of one and perhaps two years' time. There are many minor details\r\nconnected with the care of the coffee tree which would occupy too much\r\nspace to describe here, and which the coffee planter can easily learn as\r\nhe carries on the work of coffee planting. Without doubt coffee planting\r\nin this country is destined to become a great industry. We have large\r\ntracts of the finest coffee lands in the world, only waiting to be\r\ncultivated to make prosperous and happy homes. One parting word to the\r\nintending coffee planter, take Davie Crockett's motto, \"Be sure you're\r\nright and then go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATE OF COST OF ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A COFFEE

The soil and climate of the Hawaiian Islands\r\nwill grow almost anything that grows in any other country. All Northern\r\nfruits can be grown if one will only go high enough on the mountain\r\nslopes of Maui and Hawaii. But the coffee planter must confine himself\r\nto such things as will thrive in the vicinity in which his coffee trees\r\nare planted, and it is for the information of intending planters that\r\nthis chapter is written.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, almost all kinds of vegetables will grow in such\r\nprofusion as will astonish those who have lived only in Northern climes.\r\nGreen and sweet corn, potatoes, Irish and sweet, cabbages, tomatoes,\r\nbeans, lettuce, radishes and many other kinds of vegetables, all of the\r\nfinest quality and in the greatest profusion, can be had every day in\r\nthe year. Strawberries and raspberries can also be had all the year\r\nround. In addition to oranges and limes, which grow to perfection in\r\nthis country, many fruits peculiar to tropical and semi-tropical\r\nclimates grow well and flourish in these Islands. Among the more\r\nimportant is the Avocado Pear (Persea Gratissima), commonly called the\r\nAlligator Pear. This tree grows well and bears fruit, of splendid\r\nquality, in from 3 to 5 years from seed. The fruit is much esteemed by\r\nall classes. A small quantity of the fruit is shipped to California;\r\nwhat reaches there in good condition is quickly bought at high prices.\r\nIt can only be carried safely in cold storage, and this is very\r\nexpensive freight. A native peach does well, and will bear fruit in two\r\nyears from seed. The fruit is much smaller than the American peach,\r\nwhich by the way does not do well on elevations below 4000 feet, but\r\nvery sweet and juicy and makes excellent preserves and pies. Without\r\ndoubt this peach could in a few years be improved so as to rival peaches\r\nof any other country. The Mango (Mangifera Indica) is a tropical fruit\r\ntree that grows in the greatest profusion and bears enormous crops of\r\ndelicious fruit. It comes into bearing in 5 or 6 years from seed and\r\ndoes well from sea level to an elevation of 2000 feet. The fruit is much\r\nliked by every one; the green fruit is made into a sauce resembling, but\r\nmuch superior to, apple butter.\r\n\r\nThe Guava (Psidium Guayava) grows wild in all parts of the Islands\r\nbelow 3000 feet. The fruit, of which there is a great abundance, is\r\nmade into jam and the very finest jelly in the world. In the fruiting\r\nseason large quantities of the jelly can be made, and without doubt,\r\nexported at a profit.\r\n\r\nThe Poha (Physalis edulis) is a quick growing shrub bearing a berry that\r\nmakes excellent jelly and jam. The shrub grows wild on elevations\r\nbetween 1000 and 4000 feet. A patch of pohas planted in a corner of a\r\ngarden, will grow and yield a bountiful supply of fruit almost without\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nPineapples are at home on these Islands; a small plot planted with the\r\nbest varieties of this king of fruits will keep the table supplied the\r\nyear round.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable fruit indigenous to this country is the Papaia (Carica\r\npapaya). This fine fruit can be raised in enormous quantities and is a\r\nmost fattening food for pigs and chickens. The tree fruits in eight or\r\nnine months from the seed, and thence forward for years it yields ripe\r\nfruit every month in the year. The fruit is of the size of a small\r\nmelon and is very rich in sugar. The unripe fruit contains a milky juice\r\nthat, even when diluted with water, renders any tough meat, that is\r\nwashed in it, quite tender. A small piece of the unripe fruit placed in\r\nthe water in which meat or tough chicken is boiled makes it tender and\r\neasily digestible.\r\n\r\nA very valuable food plant, indigenous to these Islands, is the taro\r\n(Colocasia esculenta). The variety known as dry land taro will grow on\r\nland that is moist enough for the coffee trees. The taro is a grand food\r\nplant, the tubers containing more nutriment for a given weight than any\r\nother vegetable food. The young tops when cooked are hard to distinguish\r\nfrom spinach. The tubers must be cooked before they can be used for\r\nfood, in order to dissipate a very acrid principle that exists in both\r\nleaves and root.\r\n\r\nAnother important food plant that has been introduced and yields\r\nabundantly is the Cassava (Manihot utilissima). This plant furnishes the\r\nstaple food for the population of Brazil. It is easily propagated by the\r\nplanting pieces of the woody portions of the stems and branches. The\r\ntubers are available in nine or ten months after planting. There are two\r\nkinds, the sweet and the bitter; the latter being the more prolific. The\r\nsweet kind can be fed to pigs without cooking. The bitter kind contains\r\na poisonous substance which is entirely destroyed by cooking. There is\r\nno danger of animals eating the bitter kind in a raw state, for no stock\r\nwill touch it, while the sweet kind is eagerly eaten in the raw state by\r\npigs, horses, cows, etc. The tubers are prepared for human food by\r\ngrating them. The juice is then expelled by pressure, and the residue\r\npounded into a coarse meal, which is made into thin cakes. It is an\r\nexcellent food, and said to be much more digestible than bread and other\r\nfoods made from wheat. Pigs can be very cheaply raised on the sweet\r\nvariety of this plant. A field of the plant being ready to gather, a\r\nportion is fenced off, and the pigs turned into it. They will continue\r\nto feed until every vestige of the tubers is eaten, leaving the ground\r\nin a fine condition for replanting. The tubers never spoil in the\r\nground, in fact the soil is the very best storehouse for them. However\r\nif left for two or three years the tubers grow very large and tough.\r\n\r\nBananas, in great variety, are grown in all parts of the Islands where\r\nthere is sufficient moisture. Any land that will grow coffee will grow\r\nbananas. The yield of fruit from this remarkable plant is something\r\nastonishing. It commences to bear fruit in a little over one year from\r\nthe time of planting. The stem decays after the formation of a bunch\r\nof fruit; this will weigh from 50 to 100 pounds and upwards. Numerous\r\nsuckers spring up from around the decaying stem and bear fruit in\r\ntheir turn. One-half an acre planted with bananas would not only\r\nfurnish a large family with an abundance of delicious and nutritious\r\nfruit, but would also yield a large supply of feed for pigs, chickens\r\nand other stock.\r\n\r\nThe tea plant (Camellia Thea) grows well in this country and yields\r\na tea of good quality. It is hardly likely that it will become an\r\narticle of export from this country, as we cannot compete with the\r\nvery low prices paid for labor in the great tea countries, India,\r\nCeylon, and China. But it can be grown for home consumption, and\r\nthere is no reason why every coffee planter should not have a patch\r\nof tea growing on his land. An eighth of an acre, planted out in tea\r\nplants, would yield more tea than could be consumed by a large family;\r\nthe work of cultivation and preparation is light and easy and could be\r\ndone by women and children.\r\n\r\nThe coffee lands are situated in forested tracts in which there is\r\nlittle or no pasturage for animals. Every coffee planter should keep one\r\nor more cows to obtain the milk and butter which will furnish a large\r\naddition to the food supply for himself and family. In order to do this,\r\nit will be necessary to plant such things as will furnish food for\r\nthe animals. We have several fodder plants that will yield a large\r\nquantity of feed and which will only grow in tropical and semi-tropical\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCEANIC STEAMSHIP AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLCANO HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nFirst among these is the Teosinte Reana (Euchlacna luxurians). This\r\nplant is a native of Guatamala, and grows splendidly in this country;\r\neach plant requires sixteen feet of ground for its full development. It\r\nis an annual if allowed to run to seed; but its growth can be continued\r\nby cutting when four or five feet high, and green feed obtained all the\r\nyear round.\r\n\r\nGuinea grass (Panicum Maximum), one of the grandest of fodder plants,\r\nhas been introduced and finds a congenial home in this country. It is\r\npurely a tropical grass, it grows to a height of eight feet forming\r\nlarge bunches which, when cut young, furnish an abundance of sweet and\r\ntender feed. In districts when there is sufficient moisture, it can be\r\ncut every two months. Caffir corn, Egyptian millet and Sorghum grow\r\nwell, and should be planted in order to have a change of feed.\r\n\r\nPumpkins and squash grow to an enormous size and yield an immense\r\nquantity of feed, much relished by cows and pigs.\r\n\r\nA dry land rice is being tried in the coffee districts of Olaa and Kona,\r\non the Island of Hawaii, and there is every reason to believe that it\r\nwill be successful. Nearly all the laborers on the coffee plantations\r\nuse rice as their staple food and it has to be brought from the Island\r\nof Oahu to the Islands of Hawaii and Maui. There is no doubt but that\r\nthe rice used by the labor on the coffee plantations, can be raised on\r\nthe spot, reducing the cost of living to the laborers, and making them\r\nmore contented.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that many things can be grown that\r\nwill enable the coffee planter to not only reduce the outlay for living\r\nexpenses for himself and family but will also allow them to enjoy many\r\nof the comforts and luxuries of life.\r\n\r\nWhile our main industries, sugar, coffee and rice, are being vigorously\r\ncarried on, new products are not lost sight of. Experiments are in\r\nprogress that promise to greatly diversify our industries and increase\r\nthe number of our exports.\r\n\r\nSeveral fiber plants are receiving attention, particularly the Sisal\r\nHemp (Agave Sisalana) and Sansevieria or bow string Hemp. The Sisal\r\nplant will grow and flourish on lands that are too dry for any other\r\ncultivation. Many thousands of the plants have been introduced and at\r\nleast one plantation is being set out.\r\n\r\nThe bow string Hemp requires a wet, rich land in order to do well. It\r\nprobably yields the best fiber of all the leaf fiber plants.\r\n\r\nRamie (Boehmeria nivea) grows splendidly in this country and after being\r\nwell established will yield 4 to 6 crops per annum. Whenever a machine\r\nis invented that will economically decorticate the Ramie fiber, its\r\ncultivation will become an important industry in this country. Ramie\r\nwill grow and do well wherever the coffee tree will grow, and whenever\r\nthe machine is available, the coffee planter will have a profitable\r\nindustry, to go hand in hand with coffee and employ the slack time\r\nbetween the coffee picking seasons.\r\n\r\nCocoa (Theobroma Cacao) is the tree that produces the fruit from which\r\nchocolate is made. It grows and bears well in moist humid districts, and\r\nmany of the coffee planters are setting out numbers of the trees.\r\n\r\nThere are many other economic plants that are well suited for culture in\r\nthis country. The country is entering on a new era, and as the lands\r\nbecome settled and population increases, many small cultures will become\r\npossible, which will afford many persons the opportunity of making an\r\neasy living in a land of eternal summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGEST OF THE LAND ACT OF 1895.\r\n\r\n(With reference to unoccupied lands.)\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1895, having for its special object the settlement and\r\ncultivation of the Government agricultural and pastoral land, vested the\r\ncontrol and management of Public Lands in a Board of Three\r\nCommissioners, composed of the Minister of the Interior and two persons\r\nappointed and removable by the President, one of whom is designated the\r\nAgent of Public Lands; but excepting from the control of the\r\nCommissioners, town lots, landings, tracts reserved for Public purposes,\r\netc., which remain under the control of the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the Act, the Republic of Hawaii is divided into Six\r\nLand Districts, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st.

Neither the whole nor any portion of the premises may be\r\nsub-let.\r\n\r\nSurrender may be made to the Government by an occupier or lessee having\r\nthe whole interest if all conditions to date of surrender have been\r\nfulfilled, and the person so surrendering is entitled to receive from\r\nthe Government the value of permanent improvement, whenever the same is\r\nreceived by the Government from a new tenant.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT OF PURCHASE LEASES.\r\n\r\nRight of Purchase Leases, for the term of twenty-one years, may be\r\nissued to qualified applicants, with the privilege to the Lessee of\r\npurchasing at the end of three years and upon fulfillment of special\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS OF APPLICANTS.\r\n\r\nAny person who is over eighteen years of age, who is a citizen by birth\r\nor naturalization of the Republic of Hawaii or who has received letters\r\nof denization of special rights of citizenship, who is under no civil\r\ndisability for any offense, who is not delinquent in the payment of\r\ntaxes, and who does not own any agricultural or pastoral land in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, may apply for Right of Purchase Lease, the limit of\r\nareas which may be acquired being:\r\n\r\n  100 acres first-class agricultural land;\r\n  200 acres second-class agricultural land;\r\n  2 acres wet (rice or taro) land;\r\n  600 acres first-class pastoral land;\r\n  1200 acres second-class pastoral land;\r\n  400 acres mixed agricultural and pastoral land.\r\n\r\nAny qualified person, owning less than the respective amounts stated in\r\nforegoing list, and which is not subject to residence condition, may\r\nacquire additional land of the classes already held by him but so that\r\nhis aggregate holding shall not be in excess of the limit named; or if\r\ndesiring additional land of another class may acquire the same according\r\nto ratio established between the various classes.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife may not both be applicants for Right of Purchase Leases.\r\n\r\nApplication must be made in person at the office of Sub-Agent of the\r\nDistrict, and must be accompanied by a fee equal to six months rent of\r\npremises, fee to be credited on account of rent, if application is\r\nsuccessful, and to be returned is application is unsuccessful. In case\r\nof more than one application for same lot the first application takes\r\nprecedence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF RIGHT OF PURCHASE LEASE.\r\n\r\nTerm: twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nRental: Eight per cent. on the appraised value given in lease, payable\r\nsemi-annually.\r\n\r\nThe Lessee must from the end of the first to the end of the fifth year\r\ncontinuously maintain his home on the leased premises.\r\n\r\nThe Lessee must have in cultivation at the end of three years five per\r\ncent. and at the end of five years ten per cent. of his holding, and\r\nmaintain on agricultural land an average of ten trees to the acre.\r\n\r\nPastoral land must be fenced.\r\n\r\nInterest in Right of Purchase Lease is not assignable without written\r\nconsent of the Commissioners of Public Lands, but the lease may be\r\nsurrendered to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn case of forfeiture or surrender of right of purchase lease,\r\nreappraisement is made of the land and of permanent improvements\r\nthereon, and if the land is again disposed of, the incoming tenant shall\r\npay for such permanent improvements and the amount when so received by\r\nthe Government shall be paid to the surrendering Lessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PURCHASE MAY BE MADE.\r\n\r\nAt any time after third year of leasehold term, the Lessee is entitled\r\nto a Land Patent giving fee simple title, upon his payment of the\r\nappraised value set forth in lease, if he has reduced to cultivation\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of his leased premises, and has substantially\r\nperformed all other conditions of his lease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOHALA RAILROAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICE FIELD, PEARL CITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASH FREEHOLDS.\r\n\r\nCash Freehold Lots are sold at auction to the highest qualified bidder,\r\nat appraised value as upset price.\r\n\r\nThe qualification of applicants for Cash Freeholds and the areas of land\r\nwhich may be acquired are the same as those under Right of Purchase\r\nlease system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nApplications must be made to Sub-Agent of District in writing with sworn\r\ndeclaration as to qualifications, and a fee of ten per cent. of\r\nappraised value of lot, which fee is forfeited if applicant declines to\r\ntake the premises at the appraised value, and is credited to him if he\r\nbecomes the purchaser of the lot. If such applicant, however, is outbid,\r\nhis fee is returned to him.\r\n\r\nIf two or more applications are made and there is no bid above the upset\r\nprice, the first application takes precedence.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser at auction sale must pay immediately thereafter one-fourth\r\nof purchase price and thereupon receive a \"Freehold Agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF FREEHOLD AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe freeholder shall pay the balance of purchase price in equal\r\ninstallments in one, two and three years, with interest at 6 per cent.,\r\nbut may pay any installment before it is due and stop corresponding\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five per cent. of agricultural land must be cultivated, and\r\npastoral land fenced before the end of third year.\r\n\r\nFreeholder must maintain his home on the premises, from end of first to\r\nend of third year.\r\n\r\nHe may not assign or sub-let without consent of Agent of Public Lands.\r\n\r\nHe must allow Agents of the Government to enter and examine the premises.\r\n\r\nHe must pay all taxes that may be due upon the premises.\r\n\r\nIf all conditions are fulfilled he is entitled at end of three years to\r\nPatent giving fee simple title.\r\n\r\nIn case of forfeiture or surrender the land and permanent improvements\r\nare reappraised separately, and the value of such improvements when\r\nreceived by Government from new tenant or freeholder, will be paid to\r\nsurrendering freeholder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nSix or more qualified persons may form a \"Settlement Association\" and\r\napply for holdings in one block.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for cash freehold apply to the settlement of such blocks,\r\nbut first auction sale is confined to members of such Settlement\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nAny lot in such block which may be forfeited or surrendered, or which is\r\nnot taken up by any member of the Settlement Association, within three\r\nmonths, shall be open to any qualified applicants.\r\n\r\nDisputes, disagreements or misunderstandings, between the parties to\r\ncertificate of occupation, homestead lease, right of purchase lease, or\r\ncash freehold and relating thereto, which can not be amicably settled,\r\nshall be submitted to the Circuit Judge in whose jurisdiction the\r\npremises are situated and his decision shall be final subject only to\r\nappeal to Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASH SALES AND SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.\r\n\r\nWith consent of Executive Council, public lands not under lease may be\r\nsold in parcels of not over one thousand acres, at public auction for\r\ncash, and upon such sale and payment of full consideration, a land\r\npatent will issue.\r\n\r\nParcels of land of not over six hundred acres, may with consent of\r\nExecutive Council, be sold at public auction upon part credit and part\r\ncash, and upon such terms and conditions of improvement, residence,\r\netc., as may be imposed.\r\n\r\nUpon fulfillment of all conditions a Land Patent will issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEASES.\r\n\r\nGeneral leases of public lands may be made for a term not exceeding\r\ntwenty-one years.\r\n\r\nSuch leases are sold at public auction, and require rent in advance\r\nquarterly, semi-annually or annually.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of general leases are made at discretion of the\r\nCommissioners, and may be made for any class of public lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Islands according to the census of 1890 was\r\n89,991, or in round numbers 90,000. A census of the population has just\r\nbeen taken, but the results cannot be exactly known for some months. An\r\nestimate recently made based upon the knowledge of general increase from\r\nvarious sources gives the population as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hawaiians                35,000\r\n  Part Hawaiians           10,000\r\n  Chinese                  15,000\r\n  Japanese                 24,000\r\n  Portuguese                9,000\r\n  American and European    14,000\r\n                          -------\r\n    Total                 107,000\r\n\r\nSince the census returns began to come in, it is very evident that this\r\nestimate will be exceeded by some 2,000, making the total population\r\n109,000. The increase will probably be found among Japanese and\r\nPortuguese. The population of Honolulu is 29,920, or practically 30,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING.\r\n\r\nThe vessels flying the Hawaiian flag number 52, aggregating 21,678 tons.\r\nThey are divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  23 steamers, aggregating                9,575 tons\r\n  5 barks,         \"                      4,198  \"\r\n  3 ships,         \"                      6,272  \"\r\n  21 schooners and sloops, aggregating    1,623  \"\r\n\r\nOf these vessels 13 are employed in foreign trade and 39 in trade\r\nbetween the Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCES.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the taxes of this country. A few words will be\r\nto the point upon the financial condition of the government.\r\n\r\nThe direct taxes yielded, in 1895, $592,691.92. The Customs revenue was\r\n$547,149.04 and licenses, &c., produced $600,224.23, in all\r\n$1,740,065.19.\r\n\r\nThe current expenditures are kept within the current income. Great\r\npublic improvements are provided for by loan. This is what every growing\r\ncountry has to do. The public debt of the country on January 1, 1896,\r\nwas $3,764,335. With a population of 109,000, this gives about $34 per\r\nhead of the population. The Hawaiian Government finds no difficulty in\r\nobtaining means for internal improvements, and a scheme is now on foot\r\nto reduce the interest and consolidate the public debt.\r\n\r\nThe exports in 1895 amounted to $8,474,138.15 and the imports to\r\n$5,339,785.04. This certainly shows well for a country whose total\r\npopulation is exceeded by dozens of cities. Of the exports $7,975,590.41\r\nwere accredited to sugar, $22,823.68 to coffee, $102,599.25 to bananas\r\nand $8,783.84 to pineapples. These three latter items are elastic and\r\nthe showing of 1896 will give a very large increase in their yields.\r\n\r\nOf the imports $4,121,920.22 came from the Pacific ports of the United\r\nStates and $394,399.16 from the Atlantic ports; a total of\r\n$4,516,319.38, leaving but $1,197,698.16 for every other nation that the\r\ncountry has commercial relations with.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, taking exports and imports, the business in 1895 done\r\nby the Hawaiian Islands with all its commercial relations amounted to\r\n$14,188,155.69; of this sum $12,908,508.92 was done with the United\r\nStates, which amounts to 91 per cent. of the whole business of the\r\nIslands. From these figures it can be judged how prosperous a little\r\ncommunity that of the Hawaiian Islands is, and further how close are its\r\nrelations with the Great Republic. What country in the world has 91 per\r\ncent. of its commercial relations with its neighbor?\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of Hawaii is on a sound basis. The men in charge\r\nof its government are frugal and careful of the public expenditure, the\r\nwhole tendency of the Republic is to foster industry and thrift. The\r\ninstitutions are liberal and nothing is more desirable for such a\r\ncountry than the immigration of colonists, with capital to develop the\r\nindustries and determination to work honestly and well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR TOURISTS.\r\n\r\nIt was not the intention when planning this pamphlet to speak of the\r\nopportunities for tourists visiting the Islands, but a few words are\r\nappended. The object of the pamphlet has been to show the agricultural\r\nresources and general conditions.\r\n\r\nThe great attraction of the Islands is undoubtedly the Volcano of\r\nKilauea, the greatest and most striking volcano in the world. Though\r\nquiescent for a time during part of 1895 and 1896, it has now burst\r\nforth with renewed splendor and promises to exceed many of its former\r\nefforts. Moreover, from the rising of the lakes of fire, and the floor\r\nof the crater generally, it has evidently come to stay.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only this one great natural wonder that is attractive to\r\nthe tourist. The crater of Haleakala, the largest extinct crater in the\r\nworld, is almost, in its silent magnificence, equal to the wonder of the\r\nboiling and seething Kilauea. Then the delightful climate, the balmy\r\nbreezes, the brilliant coloring of sky, sea and land, the luxuriant\r\ntropical vegetation, and the peculiar \"Dolce far niente\" life, all lend\r\na charm to which no one who visits the place has ever failed to respond.\r\nIn fact a visit to the Hawaiian Islands is one of the pleasantest\r\nexperiences of a life-time.\r\n\r\nFor people suffering from pulmonary troubles the climate is unrivalled\r\nand there are now several sanitariums where such patients can be\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco and Victoria are the two points of deportation for the\r\nHawaiian Islands. The Oceanic Steamship Line has vessels sailing twice a\r\nmonth. One steamer sails for Honolulu, stays a few days, and returns to\r\nSan Francisco. The other steamers touch at Honolulu and go on to the\r\nAustralian colonies. Round trip tickets can be obtained and also lay\r\nover tickets, at the Company's offices on Montgomery street, San\r\nFrancisco. The Pacific Mail and O. & O. S. S. lines, running from China\r\nand Japan to San Francisco, also touch at Honolulu regularly.\r\nArrangements can be made to lay over in Honolulu, visit the Volcano and\r\nproceed on the voyage by the next vessel.\r\n\r\nFrom Victoria the C. & A. S. S. sail once a month. They give the tourist\r\na chance of seeing the Canadian Pacific Railroad before coming here, but\r\na round trip ticket would have to be for a full month. By the O. S. S.\r\nlines less time need be spent on the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe cost of round trip passage is $125.\r\n\r\nThe cost of trip to the Volcano, including all expenses is $50.\r\n\r\nHotel expenses in Honolulu from $2 a day, according to accommodation.\r\n\r\nParticulars on these subjects can always be learned by writing to Wilder\r\nS. S. Co., Fort street, Honolulu; or the Inter-Island Steamship Co.,\r\nQueen street, Honolulu.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE LIST OF PROVISIONS ON THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nFresh Hawaiian butter, from 25 to 50c. per lb.\r\n\r\nHams, from 16-1/2 to 30c. per lb.\r\n\r\nBacon, from 16-1/2 to 20c. per lb.\r\n\r\nCheese, from 20 to 35c. per lb.\r\n\r\nFamily pork, from 15 to 18c. per lb.\r\n\r\nCorned beef, 7c. per lb.\r\n\r\nFresh meat, from 6 to 15c. per lb.\r\n\r\nLoin of Porterhouse steaks, from 6 to 15c. per lb.\r\n\r\nTinned fruits per doz., from $1.75 to $2.25.\r\n\r\nGolden Gate Flour, per 100-lb., $2.50.\r\n\r\nLower grades, $2.20.\r\n\r\nHawaiian rice, $3.25 to $5.00 per 100 lbs.\r\n\r\nHawaiian bananas, per bunch, 25 to 55c.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, from 1 to 2c. per lb.\r\n\r\nEggs per dozen, 25 to 50c.\r\n\r\nRolled oats per case, $5.50.\r\n\r\nIce, in small quantities, 1-1/2c.; 50 lbs. and over, 1c. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGES.\r\n\r\nThe following is an approximation of the wages paid to different classes\r\nof labor on the Hawaiian Islands:\r\n\r\nEngineers on plantations, from $125 to $175 per month, house and\r\nfirewood furnished.\r\n\r\nSugar boilers, $125 to $175 per month, house and firewood furnished.\r\n\r\nBlacksmiths, plantation, $50 to $100 per month, house and firewood\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nCarpenters, plantation, $50 to $100 per month, house and firewood\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nLocomotive drivers, $40 to $75 per month, room and board furnished.\r\n\r\nHead overseers, or head lunas, $100 to $150.\r\n\r\nUnder overseers, or lunas, $30 to $50 with room and board.\r\n\r\nBookkeepers, plantation, $100 to $175, house and firewood furnished.\r\n\r\nTeamsters, white, $30 to $40 with room and board.\r\n\r\nHawaiians, $25 to $30 with room; no board.\r\n\r\nField labor, Portuguese and Hawaiian $16 to $18 per month; no board.\r\n\r\nField labor, Chinese and Japanese, $12.50 to $15 per month; no board.\r\n\r\nIn Honolulu bricklayers and masons receive from $5 to $6 per day;\r\ncarpenters, $2.50 to $5; machinists, $3 to $5; painters, $2 to $5, per\r\nday of nine hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC LABOR.\r\n\r\nThe domestic labor in Honolulu and in all parts of the Islands, has\r\nfor many years been performed by Chinese males, who undoubtedly make\r\nexcellent house servants. During the last four or five years the\r\nJapanese have entered the field; the Japanese women are especially in\r\ndemand as nurses for children.\r\n\r\nThe following are the prevailing rates of wages:\r\n\r\nCooks, Chinese and Japanese, $3 to $6 per week, with board and room.\r\n\r\nNurses and house servants, $8 to $12 per month, with board and room.\r\n\r\nGardeners or yard men, $8 to $12 per month, with board and room.\r\n\r\nSewing women, $1 per day and one meal.\r\n\r\nGood substantial meals can be obtained at respectable Chinese restaurants\r\nand at the Sailors' Home for 25 cents or Board for $4.50 per week.\r\n\r\nThe market for all kinds of labor is overstocked and it would be very\r\nunwise for any one to come to these Islands with no capital on the mere\r\nchance of obtaining employment. The many steamships arriving at this\r\nport bring numbers of people seeking employment who are obliged to\r\nreturn disappointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUUANU AVENUE, HONOLULU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAIKIKI BEACH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCH.\r\n\r\nAlthough the written history of the Hawaiian Islands begins with their\r\ndiscovery by Captain Cook in 1778, yet the aboriginal inhabitants had at\r\nthat time an oral traditional history which extended back for several\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN.\r\n\r\nAs to their origin, these people formed but one branch of the Polynesian\r\nrace, which at a remote period settled all the groups of islands in the\r\ncentral and Eastern Pacific, as far as New Zealand in the South and\r\nEaster Island in the East. This is shown by the close physical and moral\r\nresemblance between their inhabitants, as well as by the facts that they\r\nall speak dialects of the same language, and have the same manners and\r\ncustoms, the same general system of tabus, and similar traditions and\r\nreligious rites.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of both language and physical traits tends to show that\r\ntheir remote ancestors came from the East Indian Archipelago, and that\r\nthey were still more distantly related to the pre-Arian races of\r\nHindostan.\r\n\r\nIt is also proved by concurrent traditions of the different groups that\r\nthere was a general movement of population throughout central Polynesia\r\nduring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of the Christian Era, during\r\nwhich the Harvey Islands and afterwards New Zealand were colonized, and\r\nmany voyages were made between the Hawaiian Islands and the Samoan and\r\nSociety groups. This intercourse, however, seems to have ceased for four\r\nor five hundred years before the arrival of Captain Cook.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTS AND MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Hawaiians were not savages, in the proper sense of the term,\r\nbut barbarians of a promising type. When we consider that they occupied\r\nthe most isolated position in the world, and that they were destitute of\r\nmetals and of beasts of burden, as well as of the cereal grains, cotton,\r\nflax and wool, we must admit that they had made a creditable degree of\r\nprogress towards civilization. Like the other Polynesians, they had not\r\ninvented the art of making pottery, or the use of the loom for weaving.\r\n\r\nTheir cutting tools were made of stone, sharks' teeth or bamboo. Their\r\naxes were made of hard, fine grained lava, chiefly found on the mountain\r\nsummits. Their principal implement for cultivating the soil was simply a\r\nstick of hard wood, either pointed or shaped into a flat blade at the\r\nend. With these rude tools they cut and framed the timbers for their\r\nhouses, which were oblong with long sides and steep roofs, and were\r\nthatched with _pili_ grass, ferns or _hala_ leaves. In the building as\r\nwell as in the management of canoes they were unsurpassed. For\r\ncontainers they used a large gourd (_cucurbita maxima_, which was not\r\nfound elsewhere in the Pacific), and also cut out circular dishes of\r\nwood as truly as if they had been turned in a lathe.\r\n\r\nFor clothing they beat out the inner bark of the paper mulberry and of\r\nsome other trees, until it resembled thick flexible paper, when it was\r\ncalled _kapa_ or _tapa_. For insignia of rank, they made splendid\r\nfeather cloaks, and feather helmets, which were worn only by chiefs.\r\n\r\nFor lights they used the oily nuts of the _kukui_ or candle-nut tree.\r\n\r\nFor food they chiefly depended upon the tuberous roots of the _taro_\r\nplant (_Colocasia antiquorum_), but sweet potatoes were cultivated in\r\nthe dry districts, and yams in Kauai and Niihau. They also cultivated\r\nbananas and sugar cane and the _awa_ or _kava_ plant for its narcotic\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nFishing was carried on with great ingenuity and skill. Extensive fish\r\nponds were built along the coasts, which must have cost immense labor.\r\n\r\nTheir food was cooked then, as now, by steaming it in an _imu_ or\r\nunderground oven with heated stones. Fire was produced by friction,\r\nviz., by rubbing a hard, pointed stick in a groove made in a piece of\r\nsofter wood, until the little heap of fine powder collected at the end\r\nof the groove took fire.\r\n\r\nThere was no circulating medium which served the purpose of money, and\r\nall trade was conducted by barter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL POLITY.\r\n\r\nThe civil polity of the ancient Hawaiians was far more despotic than\r\nthat of any other Polynesian tribe. The community was divided into three\r\nclasses, namely:\r\n\r\n1. The nobility or _Alii_ (N. Z. _Ariki_), comprising the kings and\r\nchiefs of various grades of rank.\r\n\r\n2. The priests, _Kahuna_ (N. Z. _Tahunga_), including priests, sorcerers\r\nand doctors.\r\n\r\n3. The common people, _Makaainana_, or laboring class.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide and impassable gulch between the chiefs and common\r\npeople. In fact, the distinction between them was primarily of a sacred\r\nand religious character. The chief was believed to be descended from the\r\ngods, and to be allied to the invisible powers.\r\n\r\nThe contrast in stature and appearance as well as in bearing between the\r\nchiefs and common people was very striking. Only a chief had the right\r\nto wear the feather cloak and helmet, or the ivory clasp, _Niho Palaoa_;\r\nhis canoe and his sails were painted red, and on state occasions he was\r\nattended by men carrying _kahilis_ or plumed staffs of various colors.\r\nWhen the highest chiefs appeared abroad, all the common people\r\nprostrated themselves with their faces upon the ground. It was death for\r\na common man to remain standing at the mention of the king's name in\r\nsong, or when the king's food, water or clothing was carried past; to\r\nput on any article of dress belonging to him, to enter his enclosure\r\nwithout permission, or to cross his shadow or that of his house. If a\r\ncommon man entered the dread presence of the sovereign, he must crawl\r\nprone on the ground, _kolokolo_, and leave in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe head chief of an island was styled the _Moi_, and his dignity was\r\ngenerally hereditary. There were usually at least four independent\r\nkinglets in the group, and sometimes the single Island of Hawaii was\r\ndivided between several independent chiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND TENURE.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the chiefs were the only proprietors of the soil. They were\r\nsupposed to own not only the soil and all that grew upon it, not only\r\nthe fish of the sea, but also the time and labor of their people.\r\n\r\nThe accepted theory was that all the lands belonged to the king, of whom\r\nthey were held by the high chiefs in fief; _i. e._, on condition of\r\nrendering him tribute and military service. Each of these district\r\nchieftains divided up his territory among an inferior order of petty\r\nchiefs, who owed to him the same service and obedience that he owed to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nIn this way the land was subdivided again and again, while at the bottom\r\nof the scale were the miserable serfs who tilled the soil. These last\r\nwere simply tenants at will, liable to be dispossessed of their little\r\nholdings at any time, or to be stripped of their personal property at\r\nthe requisition of the chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR.\r\n\r\nWars were frequent and cruel. There were numerous wars to settle the\r\nsuccession to the sovereignty of an Island, as well as contests between\r\nthe head chiefs of the principal Islands. For example, the chiefs of\r\nOahu often contended with those of Maui for the possession of Molokai,\r\nand there were frequent wars between the chiefs of Hawaii and those of\r\nMaui for the district of Hana.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons consisted of long spears, _pololu_; javelins, _ihe_;\r\ndaggers, _pahoa_, and clubs made of hard wood. They never used the bow\r\nin war, but slings made of cocoanut fiber or human hair were extensively\r\nemployed. They used no shields, but became wonderfully expert in\r\ncatching or parrying spears thrown at them.\r\n\r\nSometimes they engaged in sea fights, with large fleets of canoes\r\non each side. In general no quarter was given to the vanquished, but\r\nthere were certain sanctuaries called _puuhonuas_, which afforded an\r\ninviolable refuge in time of war. Cannibalism was regarded by them with\r\nhorror and detestation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION.\r\n\r\nThe religious system of the ancient Hawaiians was very similar to that\r\nof other Polynesians. It consisted in a great measure of nature worship.\r\nTo their minds all the powers of nature, especially those that are\r\nmysterious and terrible, were conceived of as living and spiritual\r\nbeings. Thus the volcano, the thunder, the whirlwind, the meteor and the\r\nshark were feared as being either the embodiment or the work of\r\nmalevolent spirits (_akuas_).\r\n\r\nThe four great gods, Kane, Kanaloa, Ku and Lono, who were worshiped\r\nthroughout Polynesia, originally belonged to this class, as is shown by\r\nthe cosmogony of the New Zealand Maoris. Among these four Kane held the\r\nprimacy. The souls of great chiefs went to his abode after death.\r\n\r\nPele, the dread goddess of volcanoes, and her numerous family, dwelt in\r\nthe crater of Kilauea, but also caused the eruptions of Mauna Loa and\r\nHualalai. In Hawaii she was feared more than any other deity.\r\n\r\nOne large class of _akuas_ were supposed to be incarnated in certain\r\nspecies of animals, which were feared or believed to have a supernatural\r\ncharacter, as the shark.\r\n\r\nAnother class of deities, which included most of the professional gods,\r\nconsisted of deified spirits of the dead. The _Aumakuas_ were tutelar\r\ndeities, attached to particular families, who were often deified\r\nancestors. Sickness and disease were generally caused by their\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREMONIAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThere were two hereditary orders of priests, endowed with lands, who\r\nkept up the elaborate liturgy and ritual of the temples, and also\r\npreserved whatever knowledge of astronomy, history, medicine, etc., had\r\nbeen handed down to them.\r\n\r\nThe tabu system covered the entire daily life of the people with a vast\r\nnetwork of minute regulations and penalties. Thus, it was tabu for men\r\nand women to eat together, or even to have their food cooked in the same\r\noven. Women were forbidden to eat pork, bananas, cocoanuts, or turtle\r\nand certain kinds of fish, on pain of death. There were certain tabu\r\ndays when no canoe could be launched, no fire lighted, and when no sound\r\ncould be made, on pain of death. Even dogs had to be muzzled and fowls\r\nshut up in calabashes for twenty-four hours at a time.\r\n\r\nThe human sacrifice was the crowning act of the ancient worship, offered\r\nonly on certain solemn occasions, and at the temples (_Heiaus_) of the\r\nhighest class.\r\n\r\nWhenever a temple was to be dedicated, a new house to be built for the\r\nchief, or a new war canoe to be launched, many of the people fled to the\r\nmountains and lay hidden till the danger was past.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular priesthood, there were many kinds of medicine men,\r\nnecromancers or mediums, sorcerers and diviners, who preyed upon the\r\nsuperstition and credulity of their countrymen. The belief that all\r\nforms of disease were caused by evil spirits, and their fear of being\r\n\"prayed to death\" (_anaana_), kept the people in a state of abject fear.\r\n\r\nThere is too much reason to believe that during several centuries\r\npreceding the discovery of the Islands they had been deteriorating in\r\nmany respects. As the historian Fornander has stated:\r\n\r\n\"It was an era of strife, dynastic ambitions, internal and external wars\r\non each Island, with all their deteriorating consequences of anarchy,\r\ndepopulation, social and intellectual degradation, loss of liberty, loss\r\nof knowledge, loss of arts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be almost certain that one Juan Gaetano, a Spanish\r\nnavigator, saw Hawaii in 1555 A. D. A group of islands, the largest of\r\nwhich was called La Mesa, was laid down in the old Spanish charts in the\r\nsame latitude as the Hawaiian Islands, but 10 degrees too far east.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of January, 1778, Captain Cook, the great navigator,\r\nwhile sailing due north from the Society Islands, discovered the Islands\r\nof Oahu and Kauai. The next day he landed at Waimea, Kauai, where he\r\nheld friendly intercourse with the natives, and afterwards laid in\r\nsupplies at Niihau. He finally sailed for Alaska, Feb. 2d. The Hawaiians\r\nlooked upon him as an incarnation of the god Lono, and upon his crew as\r\nsupernatural beings. Returning from the Arctic the following winter, he\r\nanchored in Kealakekua bay, January 17th, 1779. Here he received\r\ndivine honors and was loaded with munificent presents of the best that\r\nthe islands could produce. By his rash and arbitrary conduct, however,\r\nhe involved himself in an affray with the natives, in which he was\r\nkilled on February 14th, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe spot where he fell is now marked by an appropriate monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNALILO HOME, FOR AGED HAWAIIANS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY TRADERS.\r\n\r\nFor seven years after the death of Captain Cook no foreign vessel\r\nventured to touch at the Islands. After that time many of the vessels\r\nengaged in the fur trade on the northwest coast of America called at the\r\nIslands for supplies on their way to Canton or ran down here to spend\r\nthe winter. Waimea, Kauai, and Kealakekua bay were the two harbors most\r\nfrequented by them. Fire arms, powder and shot were the articles most in\r\ndemand among the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF KAMEHAMEHA.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Kalaniopuu, _Moi_, of Hawaii, in 1782, a civil war broke\r\nout, which rent the Island into three petty sovereignties, which were\r\npresently reduced to two.\r\n\r\nThe districts of Kohala and Kona were held by Kamehameha, a nephew of\r\nthe late king, while the other districts were loyal to his son, Keoua.\r\nAfter a sanguinary war lasting nine years (during which Kamehameha had\r\nravaged West Maui and conquered the district of Hamakua), he became\r\nmaster of the whole of the Island of Hawaii by the assassination of his\r\nrival, Keoua, at Kawaihae, in 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS OF VANCOUVER.\r\n\r\nThe name of Capt. George Vancouver is still cherished as that of a wise\r\nand generous benefactor to these Islands. During his survey of the\r\nnorthwest coast of America in 1792-1794, he made three visits to the\r\nIslands. He uniformly refused to sell fire arms or ammunition to the\r\nchiefs, but gave them useful plants and seeds, and presented Kamehameha\r\nwith the first cattle and sheep ever landed in the Islands. On the 25th\r\nof February, 1794, Kamehameha and his chiefs voluntarily placed Hawaii\r\nunder the protection of Great Britain, in token of which the British\r\nflag was hoisted on shore at Kealakekua.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF OAHU.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Kahekili, the sovereign of the leeward Islands, in\r\n1794, a civil war broke out between his brother Kaeo and his son\r\nKalanikupule, in which the former was killed. Soon after Kalanikupule\r\ntreacherously massacred Captains Brown and Gordon, who had assisted him\r\nin the late war, and seized their vessels in the harbor of Honolulu.\r\n\r\nHaving put his guns and ammunition on board, he proposed to sail\r\nimmediately for Hawaii, in company with a fleet of war canoes, to attack\r\nKamehameha. But the English sailors who had been reserved to navigate\r\nthe two vessels, suddenly rose at midnight, recaptured them, and sailed\r\nfor Hawaii, where they informed Kamehameha of all that had occurred.\r\n\r\nKamehameha saw that his opportunity had now come, and lost no time in\r\nmustering all the war canoes and fighting men of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nAfter overrunning West Maui and touching at Molokai, he landed in\r\nWaialea bay, Oahu, in the latter part of April, 1795. There he spent a\r\nfew days in organizing his army before marching up the valley of Nuuanu,\r\nwhere Kalanikupule had prepared to make his last stand. The Oahu\r\nwarriors were soon routed and pursued up the valley. Some of the\r\nfugitives were hemmed in and driven over the \"_Pali_,\" or precipice, at\r\nthe head of Nuuanu, a little north of the present road.\r\n\r\nThis victory made Kamehameha master of all the Islands except Kauai and\r\nNiihau. With the exception of a short insurrection in Hawaii, there was\r\npeace during the rest of his reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREASE OF POPULATION.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of the population during this period must have been very\r\nrapid. Vancouver in 1792, Broughton in 1796, and Trumbull in 1801, were\r\nstrongly impressed with the misery of the common people and their rapid\r\ndecrease in numbers. This was partly the result of wars, but was still\r\nmore due to the diseases and vices introduced by foreigners. In the\r\nsummer of 1804 a pestilence, supposed to have been the cholera, carried\r\noff half of the population of Oahu. Botany Bay convicts had introduced\r\nthe art of distilling liquor before the year 1800, and drunkenness had\r\nbecome very prevalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANDAL-WOOD TRADE.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the present century the sandal-wood trade\r\nwas at its height. This wood was in great request at Canton, where it\r\nwas sold for incense and the manufacture of fancy articles. It was\r\npurchased by the picul of 133-1/2 pounds, the price varying from eight\r\nto ten dollars for the picul. This wood, while it lasted, was a mine of\r\nwealth for the chiefs, by means of which they were enabled to buy fire\r\narms, liquor, boats and schooners, as well as silks and other Chinese\r\ngoods, for which they paid exorbitant prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CESSION OF KAUAI.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1810, Kaumualii, the last King of Kauai, visited Honolulu in\r\nthe ship Albatross, Capt. Nathan Winship, in order to have an interview\r\nwith Kamehameha. It was then arranged between the two chiefs that\r\nKaumualii should continue to hold his Island in fief of Kamehameha\r\nduring his life-time, on condition of paying tribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN AGGRESSIONS.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1815 a Dr. Scheffer was sent to the Islands by Baranoff,\r\nthe Russian Governor of Alaska. He built a fort at Waimea, for\r\nKaumualii, on which the Russian colors were displayed, and urged him to\r\nplace himself under the protection of Russia. On hearing of this,\r\nKamehameha sent a large force to Honolulu, where a substantial fort was\r\nbuilt during the year 1816. He also sent orders to Kaumualii to expel\r\nDr. Scheffer, which was done.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF KAMEHAMEHA.\r\n\r\nKamehameha I. died on May 8th, 1819, at Kailua, Hawaii. His work was\r\ndone. He had consolidated the group under a strong government, put an\r\nend to feudal anarchy and petty wars, and thus prepared the way for\r\ncivilization and Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF IDOLATRY.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his will, his eldest son, Liholiho, was installed as\r\nking, with the title of Kamehameha II., and Kaahumanu, his favorite\r\nqueen, as premier, to exercise equal powers with the young prince, whose\r\ndissolute and reckless character is well known.\r\n\r\nTheir first important act was the abolition of the tabu system, which\r\ntook place at a great feast held at Kailua in October, 1819, at which men\r\nand women ate together in public for the first time. This was followed by\r\nthe general burning of idols and temples throughout the group.\r\n\r\nKekuaokalani, a cousin of Liholiho, put himself at the head of the\r\nadherents of the ancient faith, but was defeated and slain in the battle\r\nof Kuamoo, fought about December 20th, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVAL OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARIES.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer company of American missionaries to these Islands arrived at\r\nKailua, April 4th, 1820. They soon reduced the language to writing and\r\ncommenced printing the first book in January, 1822. They found in the\r\nHawaiians an amiable and highly receptive race, eager for knowledge and\r\neasily influenced for good or evil. The principal opposition to reform\r\nwas made by foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHALING FLEET.\r\n\r\nThe first whale ship called at Honolulu in 1820, and was soon followed\r\nby many others. Their number soon increased to 100 every year, and the\r\nfurnishing of supplies for them became the chief resource of the\r\nIslands, as the sandal-wood became exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF LIHOLIHO.\r\n\r\nThe young king, accompanied by his wife and six chiefs, embarked for\r\nEngland, November 27, 1823, on an English whale ship. On their arrival\r\nin London they received the utmost hospitality and courtesy, but in a\r\nfew weeks the whole party was attacked by the measles, of which the king\r\nand queen both died.\r\n\r\n\r\nREBELLION ON KAUAI.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the death of Kaumualii, a rebellion broke out in Kauai,\r\nled by his son, Humehume. A desperate assault was made on the fort at\r\nWaimea, which was repulsed with loss. Over 1,000 warriors were sent down\r\nfrom Oahu and Maui, and a battle was fought near Hanapepe, August 18th,\r\n1824, in which the rebels were routed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT OF LORD BYRON.\r\n\r\nThe frigate \"Blonde,\" commanded by Lord Byron, cousin of the poet of\r\nthat name, was commissioned to convey the remains of the late king and\r\nqueen, together with their retinue, back to their native land. It\r\narrived at Honolulu, May 6th, 1825, when the royal remains were\r\ndeposited in a mausoleum with impressive funeral ceremonies.\r\n\r\nKauikeaouli, the younger brother of Liholiho, was proclaimed king with\r\nthe title of Kamehameha III., and Kaahumanu as regent during his\r\nminority. Her administration was signalized by a series of outrages at\r\nLahaina and Honolulu, committed by a depraved class of foreigners who\r\nresented certain regulations made to restrict public prostitution.\r\n\r\nCom. Jones visited the Islands in the \"Peacock\" in 1826, and concluded\r\nthe first treaty between the Hawaiian Islands and the United States. The\r\nnext year the first written laws were published against murder, theft,\r\nadultery and gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION.\r\n\r\nThe first Roman Catholic missionaries arrived at Honolulu, July 7th,\r\n1827, on the ship \"Comet,\" from Bordeaux, and soon gathered a\r\ncongregation. They were members of the so-called \"Picpusian Order,\" or\r\n\"Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.\" Unfortunately,\r\nmisunderstandings arose, and from a mistaken belief that they were\r\nfomenting discord and sedition, the chiefs caused them to be deported to\r\nSan Pedro, California, in January, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF KAMEHAMEHA III.\r\n\r\nKaahumanu died June 5th, 1832, and was succeeded by Kinau, half-sister\r\nof the king. The king's minority was declared to be at an end in March,\r\n1833. A tract of land was leased to Ladd & Co. in 1835, and about the\r\nsame time a silk plantation was commenced by Peck & Titcomb. Cotton was\r\nraised and manufactured on a small scale at Kailua, Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years the chiefs persisted in a harsh and\r\nunjustifiable policy, which imperiled the independence of the country.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the two banished priests from California, in April,\r\n1837, they were ordered to return in the same vessel in which they had\r\ncome, and were obliged to go on board of it. Meanwhile the British sloop\r\nof war \"Sulphur,\" Captain Belcher, and the French frigate \"Venus,\"\r\nCaptain Du Petit Thouars, arrived and interposed in behalf of the\r\npriests. As a compromise, they were landed again on condition that they\r\nshould leave by the first favorable opportunity. Again on the 3d of\r\nNovember, another priest, Rev. L. Maigret, and a lay brother arrived\r\nfrom Valparaiso, but were not allowed to land. Finally Revs. Maigret and\r\nBachelot left in a schooner for Bonabe, Micronesia. From 1835 to 1839\r\nthe persecution of native converts was resumed, but was at last put an\r\nend to by the declaration of rights promulgated June 4th, 1839, and the\r\nking's edict of toleration, issued June 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT OF THE \"ARTEMISE.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these proceedings the French frigate \"Artemise,\"\r\nCaptain Laplace, was ordered to Honolulu, where it arrived July 9th, 1839.\r\n\r\nCaptain Laplace immediately sent the Government a peremptory letter\r\ndemanding that full religious liberty be proclaimed, and that the sum of\r\n$20,000 be brought on board by noon of the 12th, or hostilities would\r\ncommence. The required treaty was signed and the money promptly paid,\r\nand on the 16th, a commercial convention was also signed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of rights, mentioned above, which guaranteed religious\r\nliberty, produced a feeling of security unknown before, and formed the\r\nfirst step towards establishing individual property in land. The first\r\nconstitution was proclaimed October 8th, 1840. It constituted a\r\nLegislature, consisting of a House of Hereditary Nobles, and\r\nRepresentatives to be chosen by the people, who voted as a separate\r\nhouse. It also defined the duties of the Governors and provided for a\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EMBASSY.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two years the French and English consuls seemed to vie\r\nwith each other in the manufacture of petty grievances. Aware of the\r\ndangers impending over it, the Hawaiian Government sent an embassy to\r\nthe United States, Great Britain and France, in July, 1842, which\r\nconsisted of Messrs. Haalilio, William Richards and Sir George Simpson,\r\none of the governors of the Hudson Bay Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT OF CAPTAIN MALLET.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of August, 1842, the French corvette \"Embuscade,\" Captain\r\nMallet, arrived at Honolulu, having been sent to investigate complaints\r\nof the violation of the Laplace Convention, chiefly relating to local\r\nschool matters. Having received an able and courteous reply to his\r\ndemands, he informed the king that Admiral Du Petit Thouars might be\r\nexpected the next spring to settle these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CESSION TO LORD PAULET.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of the embassy to Europe and the visit of Captain Mallet\r\nboth served to bring to a head the designs of Mr. Charlton, the British\r\nconsul. He suddenly left for London, leaving Alexander Simpson as\r\nacting consul, in order to defeat the objects of the embassy. In\r\nconsequence of their representations, H. B. M. frigate \"Carysford,\"\r\ncommanded by George Paulet, was ordered to Honolulu, arriving there\r\nFebruary 10, 1843. On the arrival of the king from Lahaina, Lord Paulet\r\nsent him six demands, threatening war if they were not acceded to by 4\r\np. m. of the next day. These demands chiefly related to a fraudulent\r\nland claim of Charlton's, and to decisions of the courts in certain\r\ncivil suits between foreigners. Before the hour set for hostilities had\r\narrived, the king acceded to the demands under protest, and appealed to\r\nthe British Government for damages. But a fresh series of demands having\r\nbeen made, and claims for damages having been trumped up amounting to\r\n$80,000, the king decided, by Dr. Judd's advice, to forestall the\r\nintended seizure of the Islands by a provisional cession, pending an\r\nappeal to the justice of the home government.\r\n\r\nThe act of cession was carried into effect February 25th, 1843. The\r\nBritish flag took the place of the Hawaiian for five months, and a body\r\nof native troops was organized and drilled by British officers.\r\n\r\nThe country was meanwhile governed by a mixed commission consisting of\r\nLord Paulet, Lieutenant Frere, a Mr. Mackay and Dr. Judd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OAHU COLLEGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUAHI HALL, OAHU COLLEGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION.\r\n\r\nOn being informed of these events, Admiral Thomas, Commander-in-Chief of\r\nH. B. M.'s naval forces in the Pacific ocean, immediately sailed from\r\nValparaiso for the Islands, arriving at Honolulu July 25th, 1843. He\r\nimmediately issued a proclamation, declaring in the name of his\r\ngovernment that he did not accept of the provisional cession of the\r\nHawaiian Islands, and on the 31st restored the national flag with\r\nimpressive ceremonies. His course was fully approved of by the home\r\ngovernment, and certainly tended to exalt the reputation of his country\r\nfor justice and magnanimity in dealing with inferior races.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECOGNITION OF HAWAIIAN INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Hawaiian embassadors, who had been joined by Mr. Marshall,\r\nthe king's envoy, had done effective work in London and Paris. At their\r\nrequest the matters in dispute had been referred to the law advisers of\r\nthe crown, who decided in favor of the Hawaiian Government on every\r\npoint except the Charlton land claim. At length, on the 28th of\r\nNovember, 1843, the two governments of France and England issued a joint\r\ndeclaration in which they recognized the independence of the Islands,\r\nand reciprocally engaged \"never to take possession, either directly or\r\nunder the title of a protectorate, or under any other form, of any part\r\nof the territory of which they are composed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nBoth the king and his advisers saw that in order to maintain a permanent\r\ngovernment it was necessary to combine both the native and foreign\r\nelements together in one common organization, and to make the king the\r\nsovereign not merely of one race or class, but of all. During the next\r\nfew years the executive departments of the Government and the judiciary\r\nwere organized by a group of men of remarkably high character and\r\nability.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND TITLES.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of 1846-1855 the ancient tenure of land was abolished,\r\nand the foundation laid of individual property in land. In the first\r\nplace, the king as feudal suzerain divided the lands of the kingdom\r\nbetween himself and each one of the chiefs, his feudatories, this\r\npartition being recorded in a book called the _Mahele_ Book, or Book of\r\nDivision. After this first partition was closed, out of four million\r\nacres there remained in the king's hands about two and a half millions.\r\nThe king then redivided the lands which had been surrendered to him,\r\nsetting apart about a million and a half acres for the Government, and\r\nreserving for himself as his private domain, about a million acres,\r\nincluding the best of the lands. The common people were granted fee\r\nsimple titles for their house lots and the lands which they actually\r\ncultivated for themselves, called _Kuleanas_ or homesteads.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"REPRISALS\" OF 1849.\r\n\r\nFrom 1843 till 1848 the most amicable relations continued to exist\r\nbetween France and the Hawaiian Government. But this state of things was\r\nthen reversed by M. Dillon, the new French consul, who endeavored to\r\nreopen all old disputes and to create new grievances in every possible\r\nway. His principal grounds of complaint were the high duty on brandy and\r\nthe alleged partiality shown to the English language. On the 12th of\r\nAugust, 1849, the French frigate \"Poursuivante,\" Admiral De Tromelin,\r\narrived at Honolulu, and was joined the next day by the corvette\r\n\"Gassendi.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d the admiral sent to the king ten demands, drawn up by M.\r\nDillon, allowing the Hawaiian Government three days in which to comply\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nAs these demands were firmly but courteously refused, an armed force was\r\nlanded on the 25th, which took possession of the deserted fort, the\r\ncustom house and other buildings, and the harbor was blockaded for ten\r\ndays. The fort was dismantled and the king's private yacht confiscated\r\nby way of \"reprisal,\" after which the \"Poursuivante\" sailed for San\r\nFrancisco, taking M. Dillon as a passenger.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND EMBASSY TO FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe king immediately sent Dr. Judd as special commissioner to France,\r\naccompanied by the two nephews of the king, Alexander, the\r\nheir-apparent, and Lot Kamehameha.\r\n\r\nBut on arriving in Paris they found that M. Dillon had preceded them,\r\nand still retained the confidence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe embassy, however, agreed with Lord Palmerston upon the basis of a\r\nnew treaty with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE U. S. PROTECTORATE.\r\n\r\nThe French corvette \"Serieuse\" arrived at Honolulu, December 13, 1850,\r\nbringing M. Perrin, Commissioner of France, and remained in port three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of all, he presented again the identical ten demands of\r\nhis predecessor, and resumed his policy of petty annoyance and\r\ninterference with internal affairs of the kingdom. At length his\r\nattitude became so menacing that the king and privy council passed a\r\nproclamation placing the Islands provisionally under the protectorate of\r\nthe United States. This action was ratified by the next Legislature.\r\nAlthough it was finally declined by the United States, it had the\r\ndesired effect, and the obnoxious demands were dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF 1852.\r\n\r\nWas a very liberal one for the times, and has formed the basis of all\r\nsucceeding constitutions. The nobles were to be appointed by the kings\r\nfor life. The representatives, who were to be not less than twenty-four\r\nin number, were to be elected by universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1850 and 1860 a large part of the government land was\r\nsold to the common people in small tracts at nominal prices.\r\n\r\nThe rapid settlement of California opened a new market for the\r\nproductions of the Islands, and gave a great stimulus to agriculture.\r\nFor a time large profits were made by raising potatoes for the\r\nCalifornia market. Wheat was cultivated in the Makawao district, and a\r\nsteam flouring mill was erected in Honolulu in 1854. The next year 463\r\nbarrels of Hawaiian flour were exported. A coffee plantation was started\r\nat Hanalei, Kauai, in 1842, and promised well, but was attacked by\r\nblight after the severe drought of 1851-2. The export of coffee rose to\r\n208,000 pounds in 1850, but then fell off. The export of sugar only\r\nreached 500 tons in 1853. The sugar mills were generally worked by oxen\r\nor mules, and the molasses drained in the old fashioned way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFINISHED ANNEXATION TREATY.\r\n\r\nThe year 1853 was rendered memorable by a terrible epidemic of\r\nsmall-pox, which carried off several thousand people on the Island of\r\nOahu. During that and the following year there was an active agitation\r\nin Honolulu in favor of annexation to the United States. The king\r\nfavored it as a refuge from impending dangers. The missionaries\r\ngenerally opposed it, fearing that its effects would be injurious to the\r\nnative race. The negotiations were carried on between Mr. Gregg, the\r\nAmerican Minister, and Mr. Wyllie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and\r\na draft of the treaty was completed in June, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of France and Great Britain remonstrated with the\r\nking against it, while the heir-apparent was also opposed to it. The\r\nnegotiation was still pending when the king suddenly died on the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1854.\r\n\r\nHis adopted son and heir, Alexander Liholiho, was immediately proclaimed\r\nking, under the title of Kamehameha IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF KAMEHAMEHA IV.\r\n\r\nWas uneventful. He was married to Emma Rooke, a chiefess partly of English\r\ndescent, who both by her character and her talents was worthy of the\r\nposition. By their personal exertions the king and queen succeeded in\r\nraising the funds with which to found the \"Queen's Hospital\" at\r\nHonolulu. Their little son, the \"Prince of Hawaii,\" died in 1862, at\r\nfour years of age, and with him expired the hope of the Kamehameha\r\ndynasty. During the same year Bishop Staley, accompanied by a staff of\r\nclergymen, arrived at Honolulu and commenced the Anglican Mission.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year the king was rapidly failing in health, and on\r\nthe 30th of November, 1863, he died, at the early age of twenty-nine,\r\nand was succeeded by his elder brother, Prince Lot Kamehameha.\r\n\r\nThe development of the country during his reign was nearly at a\r\nstand-still. The cultivation of wheat as well as that of coffee was\r\ngiven up, but the culture of rice was commenced in 1860, and proved to\r\nbe a great success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF KAMEHAMEHA V.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Kamehameha V. was memorable for the change of the\r\nconstitution which he made on his own authority, soon after coming to\r\nthe throne. The right of suffrage was made to depend on a small property\r\nqualification and on ability to read and write. The Nobles and\r\nrepresentatives were henceforth to sit and vote in one chamber. During\r\nhis reign the Board of Education was constituted, the Bureau of\r\nImmigration formed, and the Act passed in 1865 to segregate the lepers.\r\n\r\nA treaty of reciprocity with the United States was negotiated, but\r\nfailed of ratification by the Senate.\r\n\r\nA destructive eruption from Mauna Loa took place in 1868, in the\r\nDistrict of Kau. The almost total destruction of the whaling fleet in\r\nthe Arctic Sea in 1871 was a serious blow to the prosperity of the\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThe King died suddenly December 11th, 1872, and with him ended the line\r\nof the Kamehamehas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF LUNALILO.\r\n\r\nAs Kamehameha V. died without appointing any successor, the choice\r\ndevolved upon the Legislature, which met on the 8th of January, 1873,\r\nand elected William Lunalilo, cousin of the late king, by a large\r\nmajority, amid general rejoicing. During that year, the proposal to cede\r\nor lease Pearl Harbor to the United States in consideration of a treaty\r\nof commercial reciprocity gave rise to an extensive agitation, which\r\nintensified the suspicion and race prejudice that already existed.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the law for the segregation of lepers helped to widen\r\nthe breach, and the effects were seen in the mutiny of the household\r\ntroops in September, 1873, which had the sympathy of the populace.\r\n\r\nThe King's health was already failing, and on the 3d of February, 1874,\r\nhe died of pulmonary consumption. By his will he left the bulk of his\r\nreal estate to found a home for aged and indigent Hawaiians.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF KALAKAUA.\r\n\r\nAgain the Legislature was called together to elect his successor on the\r\n12th of February, 1874. The two rival candidates were the Queen-Dowager\r\nEmma and David Kalakaua, the latter of whom was elected by thirty-nine\r\nvotes to six. A large mob, composed of Queen Emma's partisans,\r\nsurrounded the court house during the election, after which they broke\r\ninto the building and assaulted the members of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Cabinet, a body of marines was landed from the U.\r\nS. ships \"Tuscarora\" and \"Portsmouth,\" and another from H. B. M.'s ship\r\n\"Tenedos,\" which dispersed the rioters and guarded the public buildings\r\nfor a week. Kalakaua was sworn in at noon the next day, and duly\r\nproclaimed King.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECIPROCITY TREATY.\r\n\r\nDuring the next year negotiations were opened with the United States for\r\na treaty of commercial reciprocity, which was ratified in June, 1875,\r\nand finally went into operation in September, 1876, in spite of bitter\r\nopposition in both countries. The development of the resources of the\r\nIslands, which has resulted from this treaty, has surpassed all\r\nexpectation. In connection with it there has also been a large increase\r\nof the foreign elements in the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S TOUR AROUND THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of January, 1881, King Kalakaua set out on a tour around the\r\nworld, accompanied by the late Col. C. H. Judd, and Mr. W. N. Armstrong.\r\nHe was received with royal honors in Japan, and afterwards visited\r\nChina, Siam, Johore and British India. After visiting the Khedive of\r\nEgypt, the party made the tour of Europe, and returned home by way of\r\nthe United States, arriving in Honolulu Oct. 29, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nREACTIONARY POLICY OF KALAKAUA.\r\n\r\nUnlike his predecessors, Kalakaua seemed to regard himself as merely a\r\nking of the native Hawaiians, and foreign residents as alien invaders.\r\nIt also seemed to be his chief aim to change the system of government\r\ninto a personal despotism, in which he should have unchecked control of\r\nthe Government Treasury. Thus he took it upon himself in July, 1878, and\r\nagain in August, 1880, to dismiss a Ministry, without assigning any\r\nreason, immediately after it had been triumphantly sustained by a vote\r\nof the Legislature. On the latter occasion, his appointment of Celso\r\nCaesar Moreno as premier called forth the protest of the representatives\r\nof three great Powers, and such an uprising of the people that he had to\r\ngive way. Adroit politicians were not wanting to flatter his vanity,\r\ndefend his follies, and show him how to violate the spirit and intent\r\nof the Constitution, while keeping within the letter of the law. The\r\nLegislatures were packed with subservient office-holders, while every\r\nartifice was used to debauch the native electorate and to foment race\r\nprejudice. The national debt grew up from $389,000 in 1880 to $1,936,000\r\nin 1887. At the same time, under the existing law, no foreigner could be\r\nnaturalized without the King's approval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASONIC TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAMEHAMEHA MUSEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION OF 1887.\r\n\r\nAfter the legislative session of 1886, the King was virtually his own\r\nprime minister, and went from one folly to another, until his acceptance\r\nof two bribes, one of $75,000 and another of $80,000 in connection with\r\nthe assignment of an opium license, precipitated the revolution of\r\n1887. Overawed by the unanimity of the movement, and deserted by his\r\nfollowers, the King yielded without a struggle. The Constitution\r\nwhich he was pleased to sign on the 7th of July, 1887, was a revision\r\nof that of 1864, intended to put an end to mere personal government,\r\nand to make the executive responsible to the representatives of the\r\npeople. Office-holders were made ineligible to seats in the Legislature.\r\nThe Ministers were henceforth to be removable only upon a vote of want\r\nof confidence passed by a majority of all the elective members of\r\nthe Legislature. The Nobles, instead of being appointed by the King,\r\nwere to be elected for terms of six years, by electors who should\r\nbe possessed of taxable property worth $3,000, or in receipt of an\r\nannual income of $600.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSURRECTION OF 1889.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the Court and of other adherents of the old regime, to\r\nthe reforms of 1887, led to an insurrection headed by R. W. Wilcox, on\r\nthe 30th of July, 1889 which was promptly put down, but not without\r\nbloodshed. Seven of the rioters were killed and a large number wounded.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the late King and his sister were\r\naccessory to this ill-advised outbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF LILIUOKALANI.\r\n\r\nIn order to recruit his health, the King visited California in November,\r\n1890. In spite of the best medical attendance, he continued to fail, and\r\nbreathed his last on the 20th of January, 1891, in San Francisco. His\r\nremains were brought to Honolulu in the U. S. S. \"Charleston,\" arriving\r\nthere January 29th, 1891. On the same day, his sister took the oath to\r\nmaintain the Constitution, and was proclaimed Queen, under the title of\r\nLiliuokalani.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION OF 1893.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Queen in a published statement has since declared that she signed\r\nthe Constitution unwillingly. The history of her short reign shows that\r\nit was her unaltered purpose to restore autocratic government. In short,\r\nshe was determined to govern as well as to reign.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Supreme Court that the term of the last Cabinet\r\nexpired with the King, gave her an opportunity (which she improved), to\r\ndictate terms in advance to the incoming Cabinet, and to secure control\r\nof all appointments. The legislative session of 1892 was protracted to\r\neight months chiefly by her determination to retain her control of the\r\nExecutive, as well as to carry through the opium and lottery bills.\r\nMeanwhile she had caused a Constitution to be drawn up, which would\r\npractically, have transformed the government from a limited to an\r\nabsolute monarchy, besides disfranchising a class of citizens who paid\r\ntwo-thirds of the taxes. This Constitution she undertook to spring upon\r\nthe country by a _coup d'etat_, on the day of the prorogation of the\r\nLegislature, January 14th, 1893.\r\n\r\nFortunately, at the critical moment, when her preparations were\r\ncomplete, her Ministers shrank from sharing the responsibility of\r\nsuch a revolutionary act, and induced her to postpone it. In such\r\nan undertaking to hesitate is fatal.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a general uprising of the conservative part of the\r\ncommunity similar to that of 1887. But this time public opinion\r\ncondemned all half way measures, and declared the monarchy to be\r\nforfeited by its own act.\r\n\r\nThe Reform leaders reorganized their forces, and formed a Provisional\r\nGovernment, which was proclaimed January 17th, 1893 from the Government\r\nBuilding. The U. S. S. \"Boston,\" which had unexpectedly arrived from\r\nHilo on the day of the prorogation, landed a force on the 16th, to\r\nprotect the lives and property of American citizens, in case of disorder\r\nor incendiarism. The Queen's ministers availed themselves of the\r\npresence of these troops on shore as an excuse for their inaction, and\r\npersuaded the Queen to resign under protest, and to appeal to the\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nA treaty of annexation was soon after negotiated with the United States\r\nduring President Harrison's administration, which was withdrawn by\r\nPresident Cleveland immediately after his accession. The failure of his\r\nattempt to restore the monarchy by diplomacy is well known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLIC OF HAWAII.\r\n\r\nDuring the next year a convention was elected, which sat in Honolulu\r\nduring the month of June, 1894, and framed a new Constitution for the\r\ncountry, and the Republic of Hawaii was formally proclaimed July 4, 1894.\r\n\r\nAnother royalist conspiracy was formed during the fall of that year,\r\nwhich resulted in the insurrection of January 6th, 1895, which was\r\npromptly crushed by the patriotic citizens of the Republic.\r\n\r\nA dangerous epidemic of Asiatic cholera in the following September, was\r\nstamped out by the united efforts of the public spirited citizens of\r\nHonolulu.\r\n\r\nFor four years, in spite of hostile influences from without and enemies\r\nat home, the Republic has maintained peace and order, administered\r\njustice, carried on extensive internal improvements, advanced education,\r\nand kept the financial credit of the nation above par in the markets of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL DIRECTORY, REPUBLIC OF HAWAII.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nSanford B.
