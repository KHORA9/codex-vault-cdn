Finding, however, that\r\nalthough accurate in its representation of _fine_ fruit, it did not\r\npourtray the difference, nor convey the precise idea of those qualities\r\nwhich constitute the superiority of the author's; and aware that such\r\nwould have been obvious to every experienced gardener, the design was\r\nnecessarily abandoned, trusting, that as it was merely intended for an\r\nembellishment, its deficiency will not render the work less valuable to\r\nthe profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cucumber Seed-bed for October                              Page 1\r\n\r\nThe Fruiting Frame for early Plants                                14\r\n\r\nThe Seed-bed for January                                           43\r\n\r\nOn the Culture of the late Cucumber                                46\r\n\r\nOn the Hand-glass Cucumber                                         51\r\n\r\nDimensions of the Boxes and Lights for early and late Cucumbers    59\r\n\r\nOn the Culture of early and late Melons                            65\r\n\r\nDimensions of the Boxes and Lights for ditto                       83\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving, when young, imbibed a particular inclination to study the\r\nculture of the cucumber and melon, under the direction of my father,\r\nwhose character as an early framer was in high repute, I assiduously\r\ntried every experiment which was calculated to improve upon his system,\r\nby bringing them to a more complete state of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn marking the progress of their growth, I usually committed to writing\r\nthose plans which I had found to have been productive of beneficial\r\neffects. The result of these remarks has proved the compilation of the\r\nfollowing treatise, undertaken at the request of several\r\nhorticulturists, who have expressed their desire to become acquainted\r\nwith the process of my mode of cultivation.\r\n\r\nConsidering it superfluous to enlarge this work by unnecessary or\r\ncontroversial observations, I have confined myself entirely to those\r\ndirections, upon which I have uniformly acted; and have endeavoured to\r\nreduce them into as plain and simple a form as possible; at the same\r\ntime observing to omit nothing which can be of utility in this difficult\r\nand hitherto imperfectly understood branch of horticulture.\r\n\r\nSeveral gardeners, who are now very eminent in their profession, have\r\nplaced themselves under my tuition, and I flatter myself are perfectly\r\nsatisfied that the instruction they received, was fully adequate to the\r\ncompensation required; and perfectly convinced them of the superiority\r\nof my mode of culture. I here pledge myself, that the advice given to\r\nsuch practitioners is contained in the following directions.\r\n\r\nMy principal object in the different experiments I have tried, has\r\nalways been to discover an easy, as well as a certain method of maturing\r\nthese delicate plants, and, in consequence, have avoided, as much as\r\npossible, any artificial means that might be attended with difficulty or\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe only writer I know upon this subject, with the exception of\r\nAbercrombie, whose system is now totally exploded, is Mr. M'Phail,\r\ngardener to Lord Hawkesbury. This gentleman published a treatise in the\r\nyear 1795, in which he strenuously recommends brick pits for cucumbers\r\nand melons, as far superior to the dung bed. It will be obvious,\r\nhowever, to every person who has perused that work, that the plan was\r\nadopted merely through deficiency of knowledge in the proper management\r\nof the dung bed; for Mr. M'Phail asserts, that upon first attempting to\r\nproduce early cucumbers in Lord Hawkesbury's garden, he completely\r\nfailed, and was, in consequence, induced to apply to some horticulturist\r\nin the neighbourhood, to whom he paid a gratuity of five guineas for his\r\ninstruction. The principal thing he appears to have been taught, was to\r\nkeep the burning heat of the dung about the roots of the plants down by\r\nthe continual application of water into the bed; which, however, he\r\nfound insufficient to preserve them in a thriving state, throughout the\r\nwinter months. This caused him to assert that it was out of the power of\r\nany person to keep a dung bed sweet, and consequently impracticable to\r\nrear them at that time of the year. To this I have only to observe, that\r\nthe following directions will prove a contradiction; for if they are\r\nstrictly attended to, no fear need be entertained of their vigorous\r\ngrowth, either from the premature season, or the inclemency of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIn December and January, although their health is certain, I must allow\r\nthat they do not grow so fast as in other months; and this is the\r\nparticular time when difficulty is experienced by those who are\r\nunacquainted with the proper means to be adopted, although, perhaps,\r\ntheir efforts may have been attended with far more trouble than the\r\nrules here prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe dung bed is certainly of the greatest importance both in the culture\r\nof the cucumber and melon; and want of knowledge in the management is\r\ngenerally the cause of the loss of the plants in the winter season, by\r\nthe settlement of a cold moisture upon them, which cannot be removed\r\nwithout assistance from the sun: particular attention, therefore, to the\r\ndirections given upon that point is highly necessary; indeed, it cannot\r\nbe too strongly impressed on the mind of the horticulturist that upon\r\nthis greatly depends the success of his endeavours to mature them to any\r\ndegree of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks upon preserving the plants from a cold moisture, in the\r\nmost inclement weather, I have called to assistance what may be\r\ntechnically termed an artificial sun; and as this most material point\r\nmay be perfectly understood I shall here describe it more particularly.\r\n\r\nKeep the bed always wrapped up to nearly the top of the box with hay,\r\nstraw, or any kind of sweet litter; observing that hay, however\r\ndamaged, is certainly preferable; this will have the desired effect in\r\npromoting a top heat, and obviating the difficulty above-mentioned, in\r\nkeeping the plants perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nTo those who are unacquainted with the management of a dung bed, a brick\r\none certainly appears more advantageous, in being attended with less\r\ntrouble to the horticulturist, though infinitely with more expense, both\r\nin the building and consumption of dung: this, however, is a mistaken\r\nidea, for nothing certainly can be more congenial to the growth of\r\neither the cucumber or melon than a sweet steam heat: this essential\r\nrequisite, which may always be obtained by the process hereafter\r\ndescribed, can be but partially promoted in brick pits; for although\r\nwater, in its necessary application, may create a steam heat, it soon\r\nevaporates; and the heat of the linings having to pass through the\r\nbricks and tiles, it becomes dry, and quite incapable of affording any\r\nnourishment to the plants.\r\n\r\nThe limited space in which the plants are confined in their growth by\r\nbrick pits, is also a very great objection to this mode of culture. That\r\nthey derive their chief support from the extremity of the roots must be\r\nobvious to every one, and if these are concentred in the middle of the\r\nbed, and thereby rendered incapable of expanding over the flues as in\r\nthe dung bed, they must be certainly deprived of that vigour which is\r\nnatural to them from a free and uninterrupted growth, and where they\r\nexperience the whole of the benefit that can arise from the bed in which\r\nthey are placed. In short, the dung bed in so many instances is superior\r\nto brick pits, that competition in the culture of either the cucumber or\r\nmelon by the latter plan would be entirely useless; for whether in the\r\nvigour of the plants, quickness of growth, or production of fine fruit,\r\nthe dung bed, systematically attended to, as described in this treatise,\r\nwill prove beyond doubt, that the most expensive means are not always\r\nattended with the most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn the following directions, the first thing I have taken notice of, is\r\nthe early cucumber, as being the most difficult, and consequently the\r\nmost particular in its process of culture. Strict attention and\r\nperseverance in the method prescribed, cannot fail to bring them to a\r\ncomplete state of perfection within the time limited.\r\n\r\nSecondly--The necessary directions will be found for promoting the\r\ngrowth of such cucumbers as are sown in January. It is here necessary to\r\nobserve, that this is the most preferable season for those which are\r\nnot required so very early; as the increasing temperature of the weather\r\nin the course of their growth, affords facility for their being matured\r\nwith a greater degree of strength.\r\n\r\nThirdly--The method of bringing to perfection the late frame, or spring\r\nsown cucumber. The directions upon this head will be found extremely\r\nuseful, both to young practitioners, and those who are not professed\r\nhorticulturists. Many gentlemen who cultivate their own gardens, and are\r\ndesirous of possessing a cucumber bed, will find the information here\r\ngiven of great utility.\r\n\r\nFourthly--In treating upon the process necessary for the management of\r\nthe hand-glass cucumber in the summer months, I have offered an improved\r\nsystem, which will be found of considerable importance to gardeners in\r\ngeneral in enhancing the value of their fruit, by rendering it much\r\nsuperior to that produced by the common method.\r\n\r\nThe directions I have given with regard to the melon, will be found to\r\nexplode all that difficulty which gardeners have usually imagined exists\r\nin the production of this choice fruit. The description given of my\r\nmethod of culture, will at once evince the simplicity of its process,\r\nand show the certainty of its result.\r\n\r\nHaving explained the motives which induced me to undertake this work, I\r\nhave only to observe, that the system has been productive of great\r\nadvantage to myself, in enabling me to supersede my contemporaries in\r\nseveral annual shows, by obtaining the prize; and, to render this\r\neffective to every person, the principal thing required, as before\r\nmentioned, is attention and perseverance in the rules prescribed; and\r\nthose who adopt them will, I am confident, acknowledge their utility,\r\nand be sensible of the benefits that must eventually arise from a\r\npractical improvement in this particular branch of horticulture.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WATKINS.\r\n\r\nHighbury Park, January 30, 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF THE\r\n\r\nCucumber and Melon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT REQUIRED IN THE CULTURE OF EARLY CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SEED-BED FOR OCTOBER:\r\n\r\n_To be sown from the 10th to the 20th of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne load of horse-dung, or twenty barrows-full, will be sufficient for a\r\none-light box, and let it be put together at least three weeks before\r\nmaking the bed, in a round or square heap, being particular in well\r\ntreading it down. If the dung is dry, it will be necessary to give it\r\nsome water; if very dry, a dozen pots will be required. Let it lay in\r\nthis state a week, and then turn it, shaking the outsides of the heap\r\ninto the middle, and give it some more water. In doing this, it is\r\nrequisite that the heap should be well shook to pieces, and trod down.\r\nLet it lay another week, at the expiration of which, observe the same\r\ndirections as before given, applying the quantity of water in proportion\r\nto the dry nature of the dung. At the end of the third week, it will be\r\nin a proper condition to make use of, as by that time it will be\r\nsufficiently moist and hot, the necessary state in which it should be,\r\nbefore the formation of the bed.\r\n\r\nAs much depends upon the nature of the dung, and its proper condition,\r\ngreat attention should be paid, and some judgment exercised in the means\r\nbest calculated to prepare it for a state of fermentation. The most\r\ncertain method that can be adopted, and likely to ensure a beneficial\r\nresult is, in the summer months, to pack the dung you intend to make use\r\nof for the October seed-bed as close together as possible, taking care\r\nto keep it dry, that it may retain its virtue. This sort of dung is far\r\npreferable to that newly made, being less rank and not so liable to\r\nburn; and when under a state of preparation, by turning and moistening,\r\nas before described, it will be in a much better condition than any that\r\ncan be fresh procured.[1]\r\n\r\nBefore forming the bed, let the bottom be made in the following\r\nmanner:--Raise the ground about six inches above the level with road\r\nsand or mould, upon the top of which place some fagots, or other kind of\r\nwood, to the height of a foot, in order that the bed may be well\r\ndrained. If there is an insufficiency of dung, you can add a foot of dry\r\nrubbish, such as strawberry or asparagus halm, or any other loose stuff.\r\nLet the bottom be extended nine inches wider than the frame you intend\r\nto make use of, the height of the bed being at the back four feet, and\r\nin the front, three feet nine inches. Beat it well down with a fork;\r\nthen put the box on, and fill it three parts full with the shovellings\r\nof the dung that is left; after which, place on the light, and let it be\r\nclose shut down. As soon as you discover the heat rising, admit air by\r\nopening the frame about an inch: when it increases, so as to become very\r\nhot, admit more air, by extending the aperture to two inches. It must\r\nremain in this situation about a week; then fork it up above a foot\r\ndeep, and if caked together, or in the least dry, give it more water.\r\nFrom two to four pots is generally sufficient; but the quantity must be\r\nregulated by the state of the bed. Here it is necessary to observe, that\r\nmoisture is of most important consequence to the seed-bed, and nothing\r\nis so well calculated to sweeten and cleanse it from impurity as water.\r\n\r\nIn two or three days after forking up, it will be necessary to take off\r\nthe box and light, for the purpose of making the bed even. In doing\r\nthis, stir it up from about the depth of a foot, and shake it to pieces;\r\nthen put on the box again, and give the light one or two inches of air,\r\naccording to the temperature of the weather.\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to wrap up the bed with straw, pea-halm, or\r\nhay, about eighteen inches wide at the bottom, drawing it in gradually\r\nto a foot wide, within three inches of the top of the box.\r\n\r\nIn three or four days stir up the bed in the same manner as before,\r\nobserving that if it be in the least dry, or inclined to a burning heat,\r\nto give it three or more pots of water, as shall seem necessary. It must\r\nbe stirred up again in three or four days, and beat down gently with a\r\nfork, when it will be in a fit state to receive the old tan or mould in\r\nwhich the seed is to be deposited.\r\n\r\nA seed-bed should always lay a fortnight or three weeks before the seed\r\nis attempted to be sown; as many evil consequences are to be apprehended\r\nfrom sowing it before, from the firing of the bed, or the impure nature\r\nof the dung. If this be not strictly attended to, the plants will not\r\nbe brought to that degree of perfection, as might reasonably be expected\r\nfrom a bed in its proper heat and condition.[2]\r\n\r\nAfter the bed has been laid and dealt with according to the foregoing\r\ndirections, spread two barrows-full of old tan or light mould all over\r\nthe surface, having it a little deeper in the middle than at the sides.\r\nOld tan is certainly more preferable than mould, though either will\r\nanswer the purpose. Let it be put in the frame the day before the seed\r\nis sown, and cover the bed up with a single mat at night, taking care to\r\nshut it down until the morning, that the heat may be properly drawn up.\r\nTake some forty-eight size pots, and mix a quantity of leaf mould with\r\na sixth proportion of road sand, not sifted fine. The sifting mould to a\r\nfine degree is an error too prevalent in horticulture, and ought\r\nparticularly to be avoided, from its great tendency to bind.\r\n\r\nIt is very requisite that a cucumber should have a good digestion, and\r\nin order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to cover the holes at\r\nthe bottom of the pots with broken pieces; then strew a little of the\r\nrough siftings of the mould over it, and fill them up within half an\r\ninch of the brim with the prepared mould and sand. Shake it down a\r\nlittle, and sow the seed[3] from eighteen to twenty-four in a pot, just\r\ncovering it with a little mould; then give it a small quantity of water,\r\nwhich for the first time may be cold, but great care must be taken in\r\nthe subsequent waterings, that it be chilled to about the warmth of new\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThe seed being sown, plunge the pots in the bed up to the rim, and give\r\nthem about half an inch of air. At night they must be covered with a\r\nsingle mat, taking care to turn it up at at the back, that the steam may\r\npass freely from the bed. Let the air be continued both night and day.\r\n\r\nAfter the seed has been sown three days, it will be up, when the pots\r\nmust be unplunged, placed on the surface, and some water given to them.\r\nThey will now require upwards of an inch of air, both night and day,\r\nwhich will cause the plants to grow stuggy, or dwarfish, and prevent\r\ntheir drawing. In about three days give them some more water in the\r\nmorning, and they will be ready to pot off in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nPlants should be always potted off when young, as they strike more\r\nfreely in the pots; and, in doing this, the following directions should\r\nbe attended to.\r\n\r\nPut the mould in the bed to chill, the day before potting off, and let\r\nit be of the same description as that in which the seed was sown. If the\r\npots are old and dirty, wash them, and be careful in having them\r\nproperly dried before they are made use of. Take some old rotten turf,\r\nor a little of the coarse siftings of the leaf mould, and place a small\r\nquantity over the tile at the bottom of every pot; then fill them about\r\none-third full, put three plants in each, and cover the roots about an\r\ninch. The pots must not be plunged, but placed on the surface, and some\r\nwater given them with a fine rose.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have a small pot on purpose to water the plants,\r\nwhich will contain about three quarts, and has a hollow fine rose, which\r\nis much better calculated to water the plants regularly than a spreading\r\none.\r\n\r\nBe particular in watering them regular, which will be requisite every\r\ntwo or three days, for the space of three weeks or a month at latest,\r\nwhen they will be in a proper condition to ridge out.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have been potted three days, add a little mould to\r\nthem, and repeat it every two or three days, for about a fortnight,\r\nuntil the pot is quite filled. Much attention should be paid to this\r\nmethod of putting in the mould, which experience has convinced the\r\nauthor is far superior to the usual practice of filling the pots in the\r\nfirst instance up to the seed-leaves of the plants. By the gradual mode\r\nof filling, the plant is prevented from shanking, and is certain in its\r\ngrowth of being dwarfish and strong, which cannot be insured by the\r\ncommon method, as it tends considerably to weaken the plant, and renders\r\nit very liable to fog off, before taking root. By potting them low, and\r\nonly just covering the roots at first, the stems of the plants become\r\nhardened, and strike very freely upwards: as the tap roots of a cucumber\r\nalways decay when forced with a strong bottom heat.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary, after the plants have been potted about a week,\r\nto examine the bed, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is any\r\nfire heat. If such should be found to be the case, and the directions as\r\nbefore given with regard to moisture have been strictly attended to, it\r\ncan only exist in the tan, which must immediately be supplied with\r\nwater, and, the day following, stirred well up together and levelled,\r\nplacing the pots upon the surface. In another week again examine the\r\nbed, and if any fire heat still remains, attend to it as above; if not,\r\nstir up the tan, and plunge the pots about half way down; being,\r\nhowever, guided in this by the temperature of the bed, as plants sown in\r\nOctober do not require so much heat as those in the three following\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nObserve, when the plants have been potted two or three days, to stir the\r\nmould in the pots, round the plants, and likewise the tan, with a\r\nsharp-pointed stick, which will contribute to freshen the plants, and\r\nprevent any thing of a mouldy nature from injuring them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they have made the first rough leaf, top them, by taking out\r\nthe break that appears next, which may be easily done with the thumb and\r\nfinger, or a sharp-pointed stick. In little more than a fortnight, they\r\nwill be in a fit state to top down; and in three weeks from the time of\r\nsowing, ready to ridge out.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the year, the bed will not require any lining; but\r\nobserve, that as the wrapping sinks, it will be necessary to increase\r\nit, pressing it down close to the box, and keeping it within one-third\r\nof the top.\r\n\r\nIf the plants are not ridged out when three weeks old, plunge them up to\r\nthe rim, until the fruiting frame is ready for their reception, which\r\nought to be at the latest when they are a month or five weeks old. If it\r\nshould happen, however, that the frame is not perfectly sweet, by no\r\nmeans ridge them out until it is in a proper condition. After they are a\r\nmonth old, increase the lining at the back and front, about four or five\r\nbarrows-full each, applying it in the following manner:--Remove the\r\nwrapping down to the bottom, and extend the dung to the width of two\r\nfeet, and three parts as high as the bed; drawing it in to about\r\neighteen inches at the top. Cover the lining with the litter four inches\r\nwide from the bottom, and three parts as high as the box, being\r\nparticularly careful in stopping up the inside, by pressing the tan\r\nclose to the box, about three inches above the bottom. As the lining\r\nsinks, add a little wrapping to the top, formed of hay, or old litter\r\nthat is quite sweet.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Dung put together in the above manner, will retain its virtue from\r\nsix to nine months.\r\n\r\n[2] The heat required in October sown plants, while growing in the\r\nseed-bed, is from sixty-five to seventy degrees of Fahrenheit's\r\nthermometer. Should that temperature be exceeded in this season, they\r\nwill draw up very long: but after being ridged out, more heat will\r\nbecome necessary; that is to say, from seventy to eighty degrees: and\r\nthe same is to be observed with young plants raised in the three\r\nfollowing months.\r\n\r\n[3] Some gardeners are very particular in having seed that is three or\r\nfour years old, imagining that new will grow too vigorous, and not show\r\nfruit or set so well; but in this they are much mistaken, the Author\r\nknowing, from experience, that new seed, or at least not more than two\r\nyears old, is the best calculated for bringing to perfection both the\r\ncucumber and melon; possessing the advantage of a greater freedom in\r\ngrowth, and much finer fruit than can be derived from old seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUITING FRAME,\r\n\r\n_For Plants sown in October, November, December, and January._\r\n\r\n\r\nFour loads of dung will be sufficient for a three-light box, and the\r\nsame in proportion to the number you intend to make use of. Let it be\r\nput together a fortnight before the seed is sown; be very particular in\r\ngiving it plenty of water, and pack it close together. After it has laid\r\na week turn it, and if dry, moisten it with water. Let it continue in\r\nthis state another week, when the same directions as before given must\r\nbe observed; and, in a week more, the bed will be in a fit condition to\r\nmake up.\r\n\r\nThe bottom must be prepared in the same manner as directed for the\r\nseed-bed; then form the bed of dung four feet three inches at the back,\r\nby four feet in the front, allowing for a cavity of about ten inches\r\nbetween each box; then place the boxes on, and put the shovellings\r\ninside, in the proportion of two or three barrows-full to a light. In\r\nforming the bed, it is the best plan to make it in layers of about a\r\nfoot each, which will cause the dung to be much better mixed, than if\r\nall finished at first, of an equal height. Be very particular in\r\nseparating the dung, and breaking it to pieces, afterwards beating it\r\nwell down with a fork.\r\n\r\nAfter the bed has been thus prepared, put the lights on, and shut them\r\ndown close until the heat begins to rise. When such is the case, give\r\nthem about an inch of air; and in three or four days wrap the bed all\r\nround with dry litter or useless hay, eighteen inches wide from the\r\nbottom, sloping it in to about a foot as high as the bed, which will\r\ngreatly tend to promote a regular heat. As the careful wrapping up of\r\nthe bed is an essential requisite, means must be taken to keep it close,\r\nand protect it from any injury that may arise in consequence of\r\ntempestuous weather, this may be accomplished by means of sharp-pointed\r\nsticks, with hooks in the form of a peg, and about the size and length\r\nof a broom-stick. Thrust these through the litter into the bed, about\r\nhalf way up, one to each light, at the back and front, and two at each\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAfter the bed has been made about a week or ten days, take off the boxes\r\nand lights, in order to level it, and let it have from four to six\r\ninches fall from the back to the front; in this, however, you must be in\r\nsome degree guided by the form of the boxes, which it is necessary\r\nshould have a good fall, that the plants may derive benefit from the\r\nsun; then fork up the bed about a foot deep, and again place on the\r\nboxes and lights, giving nearly two inches of air, both night and day.\r\nIn about four or five days it will be necessary to again fork it up, and\r\ngive it some water, in the proportion of two pots to a light. This must\r\nbe repeated every two or three days, until the bed is perfectly sweet,\r\nwhich is usually the case in three or four weeks, applying water during\r\nthat time, according to the state of the bed.\r\n\r\nWhen you find that the bed is properly purified, put in the sifted leaf\r\nmould. A three-light box will require a large barrow-full; the quantity\r\nfor a one-light being about four shovels. After this, add to the\r\nwrapping some sweet litter or hay, increasing it to nearly the top of\r\nthe boxes, and apply about two pots of water to each of the cavities,\r\ntaking care to fill them up to nearly the tops of the boxes, with short\r\nsweet mulshy litter. This is a point but very little known, yet of the\r\ngreatest importance in the culture of cucumbers; for when the weather\r\nbegins to grow severe, if there is no cavity, and the boxes are placed\r\nclose together, in the usual manner, the outsides are very liable to\r\nbecome damp, and the cold, penetrating through, is certain of doing the\r\nplants material injury.\r\n\r\nPut a pot of plants in the middle of a three-light box, and at night\r\nadmit nearly two inches of air, covering them with a single mat; and if\r\non the following day the plants look well, they may be safely ridged\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt is requisite that both the boxes and lights should be painted every\r\nyear, at least a month before they are wanted for use; but if this\r\ncannot be conveniently done, be particular in washing them with boiling\r\nwater, in which some unslacked lime must be mixed. This will in some\r\nmeasure answer the purpose of paint in effectually destroying the\r\nvermin, or the eggs which may have been deposited in the crevices of the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants are ridged out, wash them every morning, on the\r\noutside, and about once a week in the inside, which will tend to reflect\r\nthe light, and cause them to thrive much better. When you wash the\r\noutside, push them down about two or three inches, which will prevent\r\nthe water from perishing the lining at the side of the boxes. If the\r\nplants have received no injury, and are able to bear the heat of the\r\nbed, ridge them out, letting the hills be about nine inches high,\r\ncovering the roots about an inch round, and being an inch higher than\r\nthey were when in the pots. If there is any surplus mould, rake it with\r\nthe hand all over the bed; then water the plants, taking care, at the\r\nsame time to sprinkle the bed regularly upon the surface. Close them\r\ndown for the space of ten minutes, and then admit an inch of air. If the\r\nweather is mild, in an hour it may be increased to two inches, and a\r\nsingle mat only will be requisite at night. If, however, the weather is\r\nwindy, cover them at night with a double mat, or a single one and a\r\nlittle hay.\r\n\r\nBe very particular in allowing them plenty of air, especially of a\r\nnight, taking care, however, to regulate this by the temperature of the\r\nweather. If there is much wind, they will of course require less air;\r\nbut, at all events, it is better to give too much than otherwise, more\r\nparticularly at the first ridging out, as the weather at this season\r\nbeing frequently subject to sudden changes, which, should it occur in\r\nthe night, and the plants are too confined, or the least rankness\r\nexisting in the bed, they are sure to experience material injury, which,\r\nat this time of year, it is very improbable they will ever recover; or,\r\nif with extreme difficulty, they should be brought round, they can never\r\nbe expected to grow to any degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nStir up the bed every day for a fortnight to the depth of about nine\r\ninches, with a hand-fork, and if you discover any fire-heat, immediately\r\ngive water to the part affected, that being the only effectual remedy\r\nthat can be applied. Be careful in forking close to the bottom of the\r\nhills, and if you ascertain that it fires much in this place, bore\r\nseveral holes at the bottom of the hills, and apply plenty of water.\r\n\r\nHave a sharp-pointed stick, about six or eight inches long, for the\r\npurpose of stirring the mould round the plants, in a similar manner to\r\nhoeing a crop in a garden. This will very much refresh the plants, and\r\nshould be attended to while they are young, for at least two months the\r\nday after they have been watered.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the roots begin to be visible through the hills, add three\r\nshovels-full of unsifted mould at a time to each hill, being very\r\ncareful not to mould too freely, until the beginning of February, as the\r\nplants from the middle of December to the middle of January, lie in a\r\ndormant state; consequently, too large a quantity of mould at this\r\nseason, will be attended with ill effects, in stagnating the roots, and\r\npreventing the heat of the bed rising in a free and proper manner.\r\n\r\nThis being the season when plants are most exposed to injury, and are\r\nfrequently lost, great care and attention is necessary for their\r\npreservation from the effects of the cold, in wrapping the linings well\r\nup, and giving a good top covering. If the weather is intense, they will\r\nrequire eight or nine inches covering of hay, and water only once a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are first ridged out, have dung in for a lining,\r\nwhich should always be put in the front and sides first. When the dung\r\nhas been put together a week, turn it, and at the end of another it\r\nwill be fit for use; one load being sufficient for a three-light box.\r\nAfter the plants have been ridged out a fortnight, or three weeks at the\r\nfarthest, it will be necessary to line the bed to the width of about two\r\nfeet, and three parts as high as the bed, inclining with a slope of\r\nabout six inches towards the top. When the dung has been put about half\r\nway up, tread it, and then add the remainder, beating it well down with\r\na fork. Cover the lining with litter about three or four inches thick at\r\nthe outside, and within one or two inches of the top of the box; then\r\nplace a board at the top about nine inches wide, which will keep it\r\nclose, and assist in drawing up the heat. Be particularly careful in\r\nstopping the inside next to the box, when you make a fresh lining, and\r\nbeat it close down with the hand about two or three inches above the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nWhen a fresh lining has been added, have the dung in readiness for the\r\nback, which will be required about a fortnight afterwards. It should be\r\nformed about two feet six inches wide, well trod down, and wrapped up in\r\nthe same manner as the front, within three inches of the top of the\r\nbox. Be careful that the litter is not rank; old useless hay, or litter\r\nthat has been some time laying by, will be preferable. The same\r\ndirections must be attended to in stopping up the inside of the box, as\r\nwith the front.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the heat of the lining in any degree affects the bed, and you\r\ndiscover that the inside, where it has been stopped, begins to get dry,\r\ngive it some water in the evening, just before covering up, for about a\r\nweek or ten days, which will be the means of keeping the rankness down,\r\nand causing a sweet steam heat to rise.\r\n\r\nAs the lining settles, press it down with a spade next the box, and add\r\nmore litter upon the top, which should be done every other day,\r\nobserving that when you increase one lining to have the dung in\r\nreadiness for the next; each lining not being calculated to last more\r\nthan a month or five weeks; though the back one will not want renewing\r\nquite so often as the front. When you apply the second front lining, it\r\nwill be necessary to bore the bed with a hedge-stake or mop-stick,\r\nmaking five holes to a three-light box; that is, one under each hill,\r\nand two under the bars: bore them straight rather better than half way\r\nup the bed, so that when the second back lining is applied, holes may be\r\nbored exactly opposite to the others. This will cause a free circulation\r\nof the heat from one lining to the other, and prove not only of great\r\nservice in regulating the temperature of the bed, but of equal advantage\r\nin draining off the surplus water. Take care when you add a fresh\r\nlining, to keep the holes open.\r\n\r\nAs the linings draw the boxes down, they will require rising with boards\r\nand bricks. In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to provide\r\nsome small pieces of board, rather larger than a brick, placing one of\r\neach, with a brick, under the corners of the boxes; and, as the bed\r\nsettles, increase the number of bricks. When you raise the boxes, stop\r\nup the bed with rotten moist dung, and close up the inside about two or\r\nthree inches above the bottom of the box.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be always topped when young, at the first joint, as\r\nbefore directed; then let them run two joints twice following;[4]\r\nafterwards keep them topped at the first joint, except it be blind,\r\nwhich may be easily ascertained by close examination; if you find such\r\nto be the case, let it run another joint before it is topped.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the plants should be continued in leaf mould until\r\nthe middle of January, as there is no other in which they will thrive so\r\nwell at that season of the year. Their peculiar and tender nature bears\r\na strong resemblance to young children, in the care requisite for their\r\nnurture and growth. They require light nourishment, that will easily\r\ndigest; and no soil is so well calculated for this purpose as\r\nleaf-mould, mixed with a little grit; from its excellent properties in\r\nabsorbing the water.\r\n\r\nIn ridging out the plants, one thing must be attended to in the\r\npreparation of the bed, which has not been before mentioned. Hollow the\r\nbed out to the depth of about four inches in the middle, so that if the\r\nweather is cold or windy, the dung may be pulled down half way up the\r\nhills, when it will be nearly level about the bed; but as soon as the\r\nweather becomes mild, it must be drawn away again, or otherwise the heat\r\nwill be too violent for the roots. As mould is added to the roots, draw\r\nthe dung away level with the bottom of the hill; then put it half way up\r\nagain, being, however, regulated in this by the heat of the bed, and the\r\ntemperature of the weather. After the hills cover nearly three parts of\r\nthe bed, take the dung out which has been placed round them, and level\r\nit with nearly the bottom of the box, leaving three or four inches\r\nround the sides to keep out the rankness from the linings, as before\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nIn covering up the plants, a single mat will be sufficient, until they\r\nhave been ridged out a fortnight, unless the weather is windy or very\r\ncold; in such case, make use of a double mat or a little hay; be\r\ncareful, at the same time, not to give them too much covering at first,\r\nas it will draw the plants, and cause them to grow very weak; in this,\r\nhowever, you must be in some degree guided by the heat of the bed, and\r\nthe temperature of the weather. When there is a good heat, and the\r\nweather is still, they will require less; but if there is much wind, or\r\nthe air is very cold, it must of course be increased. It seldom occurs\r\nthat plants require much covering until a fortnight before Christmas,\r\nwhen it will be found necessary, if the weather is moderate, to cover\r\nthem from four to six inches. Instances have occurred, when the author\r\nhas been obliged to increase the covering to a foot in thickness, from\r\nthe intense cold; but this, however, is seldom the case; and from four\r\nto six inches may generally be considered sufficient from December to\r\nApril. As the sun increases, and the nights become milder, reduce the\r\ncovering to three or four inches, until May; from whence to June a\r\nsingle mat, or a little hay or litter will be sufficient. If the weather\r\nis now seasonable, and the nights warm, they will not require any\r\ncovering, but should this not be the case, it is better to continue it\r\neven until Midsummer.\r\n\r\nTake particular care when covering up, after a fresh lining has been put\r\nto the bed, that the mats or hay does not hang over the lights for at\r\nleast a fortnight, as such will draw the rank steam into the bed, and\r\nkill the plants.\r\n\r\nThe linings should be continued until the weather is fine and settled,\r\nwhich may be expected in the middle of May; but should the weather be\r\ncold and unfavourable, it may be necessary to retain them until the\r\nmiddle of June.\r\n\r\nIn about the third week of the month of January, the plants will\r\nrequire stronger food; and half bog and half leaf mould may be applied.\r\nShould there be a difficulty in obtaining bog earth, procure the top\r\nspit of light meadow earth, and lay it up for twelve, or, at the least,\r\nsix months before it is wanted for use. When you mould towards the\r\noutside, it may be still stronger, mixing rotten dung or leaf mould, in\r\nthe proportion of one-fourth, with bog or light meadow earth; observing,\r\nhowever, not to mould up the plants level until some time after fruit\r\nhas been cut. The beginning of March is the proper time to mould up\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nLet a cavity be left at the back and front of the box of about two\r\ninches, to prevent the roots from being injured on the outside of the\r\nbox by the linings; and to cause the heat to rise freely from the bed.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary that the plants should be kept thin of vine, as\r\nbeing material in the growth of fine fruit; and as they extend towards\r\nthe outside of the bed, do not suffer them to run more than one joint\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nKeep the leaves thinned, by taking out the oldest first, in order that\r\nthey may stand single, and not one over the other; to accomplish which\r\nit will be necessary to peg them out. When taking off the leaves, cut\r\nthem close to the vine, not leaving a long stalk, as that will rot and\r\ninjure the plants. When they are laid, be particular in having the\r\nplants down close to the mould, as early as possible, in order that they\r\nmay strike root; at the same time being careful not to bury the vine. In\r\ndoing this, place a little mould round the side of the vine first,\r\nleaving the top uncovered until it is a little hardened, and the roots\r\nbegin to strike. When such is the case, cover the vine all over, and\r\nthen you may continue laying within one joint of the extremity.\r\n\r\nIt is here necessary to observe, that very few are acquainted with the\r\nadvantages that may be derived from laying the plants in a proper\r\nmanner. Many even, who are in the habit of observing this method,\r\npractice it so slightly, that little if any benefit results from it; and\r\nby far the greatest number of horticulturists take no notice of it\r\nwhatever. Laying is certainly a most material point in the culture of\r\nthe early cucumber; and it is impossible to ensure a good crop without a\r\nstrict attention to it: in fact, the Author principally attributes his\r\nsuccess in the production of fine fruit, to his extreme care in this\r\nparticular. It should be done every fortnight or three weeks after the\r\nplants have come into bearing; and, if continued in a regular manner,\r\ngood fruit may be obtained until October. Some imagine that October sown\r\nplants will soon be worn out, after producing a few cucumbers early; but\r\nthis is a mistaken idea, for, if the laying is continued regularly, they\r\nwill bear good fruit equally as long as any young plants sown in the\r\nspring. Leaf-mould, mixed with a little road sand, is the best thing to\r\nlay them in until the latter end of March, when you may add a stronger\r\nsoil, composed of one-fourth of leaf-mould or rotten dung, mixed with\r\nbog or light meadow earth.\r\n\r\nSoft water is essentially necessary for the plants, as hard is almost\r\ncertain of producing the canker, unless particular means are adopted to\r\nprevent it. In some situations it may be impossible to obtain soft\r\nwater; in such a case, let the water stand in a tub for at least\r\ntwenty-four hours; if two or three days even it will be the better, as\r\nin that time it will be in some degree softened by the sun, and the raw\r\ncoldness expelled from it.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have come into bearing, sheeps dung is an excellent\r\nthing to mix with the water, if used in a moderate manner. The following\r\nproportion will be necessary:--To six pots of water put in the tub one\r\nshovel-full of dung; let this be stirred up continually for the space of\r\ntwo or three days, and when wanted for use, it must be again well\r\nstirred up. In watering with this mixture, be particular in having a\r\nsmall thin spouted pot, without a rose, so that it may be easily poured\r\nunder the leaves. A gallon or six quarts will be a sufficient quantity\r\nfor one light, and in watering be careful that it is not sprinkled over\r\nthe leaves. Sheeps dung, mixed with the water, will be found very\r\nbeneficial to the plants, if used moderately, as too great a freedom\r\nwill tend to injure them.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are first ridged out, they will require water every\r\nthird day, until about the middle of December; and when applied, it must\r\nbe sprinkled all over the plants and bed, observing to give a larger\r\nquantity where the heat seems most to prevail. In general more water is\r\nrequisite at the back than the front: unless there is much heat in the\r\nfront from the middle of December until the middle of January, once in\r\nfive or six days will be sufficient to water the plants. Round the side\r\nof the box, and at the back, however, should be watered every night,\r\nwhile there is much heat. About two or three quarts of water at each\r\ntime to a light will be sufficient for the plants until the middle of\r\nJanuary and from that time more will be necessary. In applying the water\r\nyou must be guided in a great measure by the state of the weather. Take\r\nthe opportunity of watering when the sun is out, and then close them\r\ndown for about a quarter of an hour or more, according to the season of\r\nthe year. At all times, before watering, admit double the usual quantity\r\nof air about a quarter of an hour previous to the application, for the\r\npurpose of hardening the plants.\r\n\r\nWater may be applied at any time of the day, if the heat is good, but\r\nthe most preferable time is certainly about eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, particularly as the season advances towards the months of April\r\nand May, and the weather becomes more temperate, and the sun has greater\r\npower. After they are watered, shut them down for about ten minutes or a\r\nquarter of an hour, and let them have the benefit of a clear sun; then\r\nshade them with a mat for two or three hours, and shut the frame close\r\ndown, in order that a moist sweet steam heat may be produced, which will\r\ncause the fruit to swell very quick. At one or two o'clock take off the\r\nmat and admit a little air. When the sun is clear and the weather hot,\r\nlet them be shaded from eleven to two o'clock; some evergreen boughs or\r\npea-sticks are very good things.\r\n\r\nShould the above directions be found inconvenient to attend to, the\r\ndifficulty may be obviated by adopting the following method. After the\r\nplants are watered in a morning, shut them down, for the space of about\r\nten minutes, then give them a little air; in about the same time\r\nincrease it, and so gradually until the proper quantity is admitted. The\r\ngradual admission of air is extremely important, and ought, therefore,\r\nto be particularly attended to.\r\n\r\nThe frames should never be shut down too long in the morning of the\r\nspring and summer months; a little air should be given at eight o'clock,\r\nif the weather is fine, in an hour it will be necessary to increase it;\r\nafterwards attending to it according to the state of the weather.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce fine fruit in the early part of the season, that is\r\nin February and March; let only one grow on a plant at a time. Keep the\r\nmale blossoms rubbed off when young, to prevent their weakening the\r\nplants; the best method of doing which is with a small pointed stick.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants begin to show fruit, leave a few male blossoms to\r\nset the fruit with. If this be not attended to in the early part of the\r\nseason[5] the fruit will not swell off, as it is the female blossom\r\nalone that bears it, and if these be not impregnated with the male they\r\nwill prove unfruitful. The female flower may easily be distinguished\r\nfrom the male, by the appearance of the fruit at the bottom of the\r\nblossom which the other does not possess.\r\n\r\nWhen the female flower is in full bloom, take a male blossom which is in\r\nfull bloom also, and hold it in one hand, with the other split it down,\r\nand tear off the flowers, being careful at the same time not to injure\r\nthe male part; then hold the male blossom between the forefinger and\r\nthumb of the right hand, while the female flower is held between the\r\nmiddle and forefinger of the left hand; then put the male blossom in the\r\ncentre of the female, and the farina will adhere to it, and have the\r\ndesired effect; should it, however, happen to fall out after it is done,\r\nit is of no consequence whatever, as the impregnation is received the\r\ninstant it is put in.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to set the fruit is in the morning, as it always comes\r\nin bloom at night, and if left until the afternoon the blossom of the\r\nfruit closes a little, in consequence of which it is doubtful whether\r\nfruition will be effected.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain whether the male blossom is good; after you have\r\nprepared it as above described for use, draw the farina, or genitals,\r\nacross the thumb-nail, and if good, it will leave a glutinous substance\r\nresembling gum.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fruit becomes the size of your finger let no more than\r\none be upon a plant at a time to swell off, and when beginning to grow\r\ncrooked give the stalk end a twist, place them on their backs, put a peg\r\nto the side, and the heat of the bed will soon draw them down and make\r\nthem straight.\r\n\r\nA cucumber is a plant that requires much water, particularly when\r\nbearing fruit: it will be necessary then to give from one to two gallons\r\neach time according to the heat of the bed, and temperature of the\r\nweather. If the season is fine and the heat good they will require water\r\nevery other day, but if the weather is dull, and the heat slack, be very\r\ncautious in applying the water lest they should get the canker, which is\r\na dangerous disorder, and very difficult to be removed. The best thing\r\nin such a case is to give a strong heat, and be very moderate in the\r\napplication of water.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have been ridged out a fortnight it will be necessary\r\nto shut them down in the afternoon, about an hour before they are\r\ncovered up. They will, however, require air in the night, generally till\r\nthe fruit is cut, and even then if the weather is mild; for by being\r\nkept close at night when there is a strong heat, the fruit is liable to\r\nchange colour and become of a yellow cast.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be uncovered in a morning by eight o'clock, or nine at\r\nfarthest, in the winter, and six or seven as the season advances, unless\r\nthe weather is very cold or windy, when they may remain an hour longer\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\nShould the frame be infested with woodlice, place some cabbage-leaves or\r\na small quantity of hay in the bed, which will answer the purpose of a\r\ntrap to collect them, when they may be easily destroyed by boiling\r\nwater. Care, however, is necessary in this expedient, for should the\r\nplants have taken root at the side of the box, the hot water will\r\nmaterially injure them; but if the plants are kept healthy, little\r\ndanger is to be apprehended from this description of vermin, as they\r\nalways like a sickly stagnated plant to a thriving vigorous one. Mice\r\nare sometimes extremely troublesome, but may be destroyed by procuring\r\nfrom a Chemist some ground ox vomicae, and applying it in the following\r\nmanner. Mix the drug with some water, stir it up well, and let it boil\r\nabout ten minutes; take it off the fire and put in some wheat or\r\ncucumber seed, letting it steep for ten or twelve hours; or spread some\r\nox vomicae not boiled upon bread and fresh butter, place this in the bed\r\nnear the holes at which they enter, which will effectually extirpate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the time of cutting fruit[6] from October sown plants,\r\nmuch depends upon the weather, some seasons being much finer than\r\nothers. Fruit from the October seed has been cut off by the Author as\r\nearly as the middle of January, while at another time it has been as\r\nlate as the beginning of March; he, however, is well satisfied if it is\r\nready to cut by the middle of February: indeed, upon an average this may\r\nbe fairly considered as the probable time for its mature growth.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable in any young beginner to sow seed in November or\r\nDecember until about the twentieth of the latter month, as plants grown\r\nin that season are very liable to be retarded in their growth, while\r\nthose sown from about the twentieth of December to the beginning of\r\nJanuary will grow much stronger and quicker, as they possess the\r\nadvantage of the increase of the season. An experienced framer, however,\r\ncan grow plants at any time of the year, and from those sown at the\r\nabove time, he may expect to cut fruit by the twentieth of March or\r\ntowards the latter end of that month, according to the weather; much\r\ndepending upon that and the situation of the framing grounds, which\r\nshould at all times be open to the sun, and defended from the winds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The Author would recommend January-sown plants, after having been\r\ntopped at the first joint, to run four joints, then topped again at the\r\nfirst joint, when they will generally show fruit, and, if properly\r\nattended to, will swell off to seven or eight inches in length, as the\r\nfirst shows do not come so fine as those afterwards. Do not let more\r\nthan one fruit swell upon a plant at a time, as more will cause them to\r\ngrow ill-shaped, and not near so fine.\r\n\r\n[5] There is no necessity for setting the fruit beyond the latter end of\r\nMay, as by that time the bees will find their way to the frames, and\r\nprove equally effective.\r\n\r\n[6] The Author has tried several sorts, but at present only makes use of\r\nthree kinds of frame cucumber, which he considers preferable to all the\r\nothers. One is a long black prickly fruit, with a fine bloom and short\r\nhandle, well filled up. It will sometimes grow for table to the length\r\nof fifteen inches, and usually from eleven to twelve. It is an excellent\r\nbearer, but not so well adapted for October sowing as the other two\r\nkinds, from its tender qualities, being thin leaved and less hardy: it\r\nis, however, a very good sort for January and spring sowing. The other\r\ntwo kinds very much resemble each other, and will frequently grow to the\r\nlength of twelve inches, filled up in the handle, black, prickly, and\r\ncarry a good bloom. Their usual dimensions are from eight to ten inches;\r\nbeing thick-leaved and particularly hardy. Both these are well\r\ncalculated for the October bed, and excellent bearers for spring sowing.\r\nThe Author obtained them both by impregnating; and those who purchase\r\nthe work of him, may be accommodated with a few of the seeds of either\r\nof the above, gratis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEED-BED FOR JANUARY.\r\n\r\n_To be sown in the beginning of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this is the season in which Gardeners in general sow seed for\r\ncucumbers, it will be necessary to take notice of a few directions which\r\nvary from the October seed-bed.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the year young plants are much slower in their growth,\r\nand more difficult to be reared than in October, consequently they\r\nrequire a stronger bottom bed, though made in the same manner as above\r\ndirected. The dung must undergo the same process in working, but should\r\nbe six inches higher; it will also require more wrapping and covering,\r\nparticularly if the weather is very cold; in this, however, as before,\r\nyou must be guided by the temperature of the season; taking care not to\r\ncover too much at first. For the first fortnight a double mat will be\r\nsufficient; and after that, if the weather is intense, increase the\r\ncovering, by adding hay to the thickness of six or nine inches, with a\r\nmat over it. Air should be admitted night and day, according to the\r\nstate of the weather; but they may be closed down for about an hour,\r\nbefore covering up, after they are a fortnight old.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be ridged out young, at least when they are a month\r\nold; but be very particular in having the fruiting-frame perfectly sweet\r\nbefore they are placed in it, as it is much better to keep them in the\r\npots a week, or even a fortnight, beyond the time, than to ridge them\r\nout before the bed is in a proper condition.\r\n\r\nBe careful in keeping a good heat; in having the lining applied in\r\nproper time; and in well wrapping them up. The lining will be required\r\nwhen they are three weeks old at the back and front. It should be two\r\nfeet wide about half way up the bed, and lined with litter to the width\r\nof six inches, for the purpose of keeping the lining in a proper\r\ncondition: wrap it up also within three inches of the top, drawing it in\r\ngradually to about eighteen inches wide. With the exception of the\r\nforegoing directions, the method of treatment must be exactly the same\r\nas given in the Seed-bed for October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT REQUIRED IN THE CULTURE OF THE\r\n\r\nLate Cucumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper time to sow for late cucumbers, that is, such as are grown in\r\nboxes and lights, and have no necessity for linings, is from the middle\r\nof March to the middle of April; and after that time seed may be put in\r\nfor the hand-glass.\r\n\r\nThose that are sown in the middle of March will require stronger beds\r\nthan those sown a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, and should be\r\nmade from two feet six inches to three feet high; while the latter will\r\nnot require beds higher than two feet.\r\n\r\nLet a trench be dug the size of the frame, about eighteen inches deep,\r\nand if the soil is light and rich that is thrown out, the bed may be\r\nformed of it; but if a strong loam it will not answer the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bed is made tread it down well, make it even, and let it\r\nhave about six inches fall from the back to the front; then place on the\r\nboxes and light; and when the heat rises, admit from one to two inches\r\nof air. In about a week it will be necessary to put the mould in for the\r\nhills in the proportion of a barrow-full to a light. This must be\r\nlevelled about an inch all over the bed to prevent the rank steam from\r\ninjuring the plants. On the following day they may be ridged out, when\r\nthe mould must be pressed with the hands close down round the roots of\r\nthe plants; and water applied, which should be at the same time\r\nsprinkled regularly all over the bed. Add now plenty of air, night and\r\nday, until the bed becomes perfectly sweet, which is generally the case\r\nin about a week; after which they may be shut down at night.\r\n\r\nLet the topping be the same as directed for the Seed-bed in October; if\r\nthe soil is light and rich, have a bank on the outside about a foot or\r\neighteen inches wide, and as high, or even higher than the bottom of the\r\nbox. This will prove a great support to the plants; be the means of\r\nproducing an abundant crop of fruit; and obviate the necessity of\r\nlaying; which must otherwise be the case if this plan is not adopted, or\r\nthe boxes are unusually large. Should laying, however, be preferred,\r\ngreat attention must be paid to it, and the same method adopted as\r\nprescribed for the early cucumber.\r\n\r\nParticular care is requisite in the culture of the late cucumber to\r\npreserve it from the canker; the best means that can be adopted to\r\nprevent this injury is to keep them thin of vine, and always apply soft\r\nwater. This should be given in the morning, or, if not then convenient,\r\nnever later than three o'clock in the afternoon, when the vines will\r\nhave an opportunity of drying before night: a fine day should always be\r\ntaken advantage of for this purpose, which will tend considerably to\r\naccelerate their growth. Admit a double quantity of air for a quarter\r\nof an hour before watering; and while the nights continue cold, be\r\ncareful in keeping them covered up. In some seasons, when the weather is\r\ninclement, it will be necessary to observe this even until Midsummer.\r\n\r\nBy strict attention to the foregoing directions, no danger need be\r\napprehended from the canker, as it generally proceeds from a cold chill;\r\nsuffering the plants to grow too thick of vine, which keeps them\r\ncontinually moist; and not admitting a sufficient quantity of air\r\nnecessary to harden them.\r\n\r\nIn ridging out the plants, put two in small lights and three in larger\r\nones; and when the roots appear through the hills, add mould to them;\r\nobserving, that they will require moulding up much quicker than those\r\ngrown at the early season: in fact, after they have been ridged out\r\nabout a fortnight or three weeks, it will be necessary to mould them up\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is fine, from one to two gallons of water for each light\r\nwill be necessary every two or three days.\r\n\r\nKeep them pegged and laid about once a fortnight; and be particular also\r\nin having them thin of vine, topped at the first joint; then allowing\r\nthem to run four, and afterwards topping them again at the first, as\r\nbefore mentioned in the January sown plants. By observing these\r\ndirections, a good crop of fruit may be ensured, which will be ready to\r\ncut in about a month or five weeks after they have been ridged out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT REQUIRED IN THE CULTURE OF THE\r\n\r\nHand-glass Cucumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best time to sow for the hand-glass cucumber is from the middle of\r\nApril to the beginning of May; though they may be sown from the tenth of\r\nApril until the middle of May; and the plants may be grown in the early\r\ncucumber or melon beds.\r\n\r\nWhen they are potted off, put three plants in each pot, being particular\r\nin not filling them more than three parts full, as they are very liable\r\nat this time of the year to draw up long in the stem. Merely cover the\r\nroots with mould at first; in the course of two or three days add a\r\nlittle more; and in about a week fill up the pots to the brim.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to give them as much air as possible; and to have them\r\nplaced at the back of the bed, as near the glass as convenient. They\r\nmust be well supplied with water, and let them be topped at the first\r\njoint.\r\n\r\nBy this mode of treatment, you may have strong stuggy plants, fit to put\r\nunder the hand-glass in three weeks; at all events, they should not be\r\nkept in the pots longer than a month, as there is a probability, if that\r\ntime is exceeded, of their being stinted in the growth.\r\n\r\nThe soil best calculated to ridge them out in, is a light rich earth. If\r\nthe soil is of a strong loamy nature, add some leaf mould or rotten dung\r\nto it, and mix it up well together.\r\n\r\nDig a trench about a foot in depth, and three feet wide, and let the bed\r\nbe made up about a foot above the level, that is, two feet from the\r\nbottom of the trench; tread it down well, level it, and apply some water\r\nif it is dry; then put the mould on, and let it be dug a spit deep, and\r\neighteen inches wide on each side of the trench; afterwards put some\r\ndung or leaf mould on, and dig it in. Level the mould down, so that the\r\nbed will be about six feet wide, and nine or ten inches deep, taking\r\ncare to leave it a little higher in the middle, where the dung is\r\nplaced, in order that the mould may not settle, and become lower in the\r\ncentre, which will have a tendency to injure the plants by absorbing the\r\nwater, which is most required at the outsides.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent plan, if the ground is disengaged two or three months\r\nprevious to the time it is wanted for the cucumber bed, to mark it out\r\nsix feet wide, and put in six inches of dung or leaf mould, and lay it\r\nup in ridges of two feet six inches in width, and a foot in depth. When\r\nwanted for use, level it down, and dig a trench three feet wide for the\r\ndung, levelling it as before directed. This method, if it can be\r\nconveniently attended to, is certainly preferable to the other, as it\r\nallows an opportunity of incorporating the dung and mould together. If\r\nhot dung cannot be easily obtained, it may be dispensed with, provided\r\nthe seed is not sown earlier than the month of May.\r\n\r\nLet the ground be ridged up as before directed, and when wanted for use,\r\nlevel it down; then mark out six feet wide beds for each, and three feet\r\nalleys; afterwards place the line to the middle of the ridge, and mark\r\nout three feet six inches, which must be the distance from the centre of\r\neach glass. Take out two spadesful of the mould, level it on the ridge,\r\nand put one spadeful of light rich earth in its place, for the purpose\r\nof receiving the seed. If the natural soil is light and rich, take out\r\none spadeful, making it round and hollow, about eight inches wide; then\r\nsow the seed from eight to twelve under each glass. If the mould is dry,\r\napply water to the seed, place the glasses on, and shut them down close,\r\nobserving as they become dry, to sprinkle them with water.\r\n\r\nAfter the seed has been up about a week, it will be necessary to thin\r\nthem out, in the proportion of six plants to each glass; and in the week\r\nfollowing reduce them to three, which is the proper number to be grown\r\ntogether finally for a crop. When they are thus divided, put some light\r\nmould round the stems of the plants, which should be done at two\r\ndifferent times, allowing a week to elapse between each application, and\r\nfilling up the hollow that is left.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they have made two rough leaves, top them at the second\r\njoint. This is a plan which may be adopted with success. Hot dung is\r\nalso of great advantage, as it will cause them to come into bearing\r\nnearly a month sooner than would otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have been topped, as above directed, let them run to\r\nsix joints, and then top them again, when they will show fruit, which\r\nmay be topped at the first joint. If the hand-glasses are large, fruit\r\nwill be ready to cut very early.\r\n\r\nBe particular in not suffering them to run to too much vine; six joints\r\nis quite sufficient at the first, and afterwards always keep them topped\r\nat the first or second joint. By strict attention to this mode of\r\ntreatment, you may ensure a more abundant crop, and much finer fruit,\r\nthan can be calculated upon from the usual method of suffering the vine\r\nto grow to a considerable length, which tends materially to weaken and\r\nexhaust the plant.\r\n\r\nLet them be kept under the glasses as long as possible, without danger\r\nof injuring them, admitting a small quantity of air in the day-time,\r\nwhen the weather is warm, by means of a piece of wood, in the form of a\r\nwedge, about seven inches long, five inches wide, flat, and about three\r\ninches at the top. This will enable you to rise or fall the glass\r\naccording to the quantity of air necessary to be admitted.\r\n\r\nBefore placing the vine outside the glasses, it will be necessary to\r\nadmit a larger portion of air, both night and day, for three or four\r\ndays, in order to harden the plants; then mulch the bed all over with\r\nlitter, which will cause the fruit to be kept clean, and the roots\r\nmoist, an essential requisite in the culture of cucumbers.\r\n\r\nThough moisture is so extremely necessary, yet at all times in the\r\napplication of water you must be regulated by the temperature of the\r\nseason. If the weather is hot and dry when they come into full bearing,\r\nfrom three to four gallons of water will be required to each glass every\r\ntwo or three days, if the soil is light, but if of a strong loamy\r\nnature, less will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nLay out the vines regular, peg them down, and place four half bricks,\r\nthat is, one to each corner, under the frame of the glass; or another\r\nmethod may be adopted, in raising the glass to the south by means of a\r\npiece of stick, about the thickness of a broom-stick, a foot in length,\r\nwith three notches cut in it, about two inches apart, for the purpose of\r\nresting the glass upon. This plan is far preferable to the former, in\r\nmaterially accelerating the growth of the fruit, by preventing too\r\ngreat a current of air; besides possessing the advantage of easier\r\naccess to the plants, when there is a necessity for examining them. It\r\nis, however, requisite when this method is adopted, that the ridges\r\nshould always front the south.\r\n\r\nIf the above directions are strictly attended to, and the season is in\r\nany degree favorable, a plentiful crop of fine fruit may be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF THE BOXES AND LIGHTS FOR\r\n\r\nEarly and Late Cucumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three-light Boxes for October sowing._\r\n\r\nThe boxes should be made of good seasoned deal, one inch and a half\r\nthick, ten feet seven inches long, four feet three inches wide, and one\r\nfoot eight inches deep at the back, and eleven inches in the front. The\r\nbars to be three inches wide, to have two narrow slips two inches in\r\nheight, and one slip at each end. The bars to be fluted on each side of\r\nthe slips, with oak corners, five inches wide.\r\n\r\nThe lights to be four feet three inches and a half long, three feet six\r\ninches wide, and the back rail two inches and three quarters wide; the\r\nfront to be three inches, and the sides two inches and a half; with\r\nthree bars, rounded off to a point inside, three quarters of an inch\r\nwide. To be made of good seasoned deal, and to have horns both in the\r\nback and front. The squares must be formed of strong crown glass, leaded\r\nand cemented; let there be five in length, the one in front being five\r\ninches long. A small iron bar must be passed in the middle, under the\r\nlead of each light, which must also have iron handles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_One-light Box for October sowing._\r\n\r\nThis must be in length four feet eight inches, three feet seven inches\r\nwide, one foot eight inches deep at the back, and eleven inches in the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe lights to be half an inch longer than the box; and in all other\r\nrespects the same as those before described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For January sowing._\r\n\r\nThe boxes to be ten feet seven inches long, four feet eight inches wide,\r\none foot eight inches deep at the back, and eleven inches in the front.\r\nThe bars and slips the same as for October.\r\n\r\nThe lights to be four feet eight inches and a half long, and three feet\r\nsix inches wide, with four bars, six squares long, rabitted, puttied,\r\nand a small piece of lead across to every square. In other respects to\r\nbe the same as those for October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Spring sowing._\r\n\r\nThe boxes to be one foot two inches deep at the back, and eight inches\r\nin the front. In other respects, the boxes as well as the lights for\r\nspring sowing, must be the same as those directed for the January\r\nseed-bed.\r\n\r\nBoth boxes and lights should have three coats of paint, white inside,\r\nand a dark lead colour on the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CULTURE OF THE EARLY AND LATE\r\n\r\nMelon.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT REQUIRED IN THE CULTURE OF\r\n\r\nEarly and Late Melons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor early melons have three loads of dung for a three-light box; but if\r\nyou have previously grown early cucumbers, the old linings will be\r\nuseful for the melon bed, by mixing a proportion of one half of fresh\r\ndung with it. This, in fact, will be better than all fresh, as it\r\nrequires only once turning, whereas new dung should be turned twice. In\r\ngentlemen's gardens there is generally an abundance of leaves, and\r\nsometimes a scarcity of dung; when such is the case, leaves, mixed with\r\nan equal proportion of dung, may be used very successfully for the\r\nearly melon; and for the late one all leaves, from trees or shrubs, will\r\nanswer the purpose, particularly where there are brick pits.\r\n\r\nLet the dung be put together for a week, and lay the same time before it\r\nis turned. Be careful that the bottom is dry where the bed is built;\r\nraise it with mould or road sand to the height of six or eight inches,\r\nand allow the bottom to be eight or nine inches longer and wider than\r\nthe box, so that when the bed is made, it may be drawn up in a gradual\r\nmanner to about three or four inches wider than the box, observing at\r\nthe same time to beat it well down with a fork. Let it be about three\r\nfeet nine inches at the back by three feet six inches in the front;\r\nshould there, however, happen to be a scarcity of dung, a foot of\r\nstrawberry or asparagus halm, fagots, or pieces of wood, or, indeed,\r\nsome of each, may be added at the bottom of the bed.\r\n\r\nIf the dung is dry, apply water to it, that it may be properly\r\nmoistened; and after the bed is formed, let it be again watered, as the\r\nplants will not thrive so well, nor the linings have the proper effect,\r\nif the bed is kept too dry.\r\n\r\nThe bed should be made three weeks or a month before the plants are put\r\ninto it, and must be perfectly sweet before they are ridged out. When\r\nthe bed is in a proper condition, hollow it out in the middle to the\r\ndepth of four inches, and put a large barrow-fall of mould to each hill,\r\npressing it down close with the hand about a foot deep.\r\n\r\nThe day before you intend to ridge out, put a pot of plants in the bed,\r\nto prove whether it is sweet, which, if you ascertain to be the case,\r\nand the box is large, ridge them out, three plants to a light; but if\r\nsmall two will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to sow the seed for an early crop is about the middle of\r\nJanuary; and the early cucumber bed will do very well for the purpose.\r\nThose sown at this time will be fit to cut in the first or second week\r\nof May; but if there is no particular necessity for fruit so early, the\r\nbeginning of February is a preferable season to sow, when they will be\r\nready to cut by the latter end of May or the beginning of June.\r\n\r\nThe Early Cantaloupe is the best sort for an early crop. Let them be\r\nsown in leaf mould, about eighteen or twenty seeds in a forty-eight size\r\npot; immediately apply water, and plunge the pots in a good sharp heat.\r\nAs soon as the seed makes its appearance, which will be in the course of\r\nabout three days, if it is good, un-plunge the pots and give them a\r\nlittle water. In two or three days more they will be fit to pot off,\r\nwhich ought always to be done when about a week old, as they strike much\r\nmore freely when potted off young. Let the soil for potting off the\r\nplants be half leaf mould, and half light loam or bog earth.\r\n\r\nThe best season to sow for a second crop is the beginning of March, and\r\nwell calculated for the Stroud Rock, Scarlet Rock, White-seeded Rock,\r\nGreen Flesh, and, in fact, many others of nearly the same description,\r\nthough under different names, which they have derived from those\r\ngardeners who have cultivated them by impregnating one with the other.\r\nIt is by no means, however, advisable to sow the Black Rock before the\r\nlatter end of March, as it is only calculated for a late melon, and\r\nshould be grown in large boxes, two plants to a light. This, though a\r\nfine looking fruit, and well flavoured, will not suit those whose object\r\nis to produce a large quantity; for, by attempting to grow more than two\r\nin a light, they will not rock, nor arrive to any degree of\r\nperfection.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Stroud Rock is a particular favourite with the Author, who has\r\nproduced fruit of this kind upwards of seven pounds in weight, though\r\nthe common size varies from three to five. This description of melon is\r\nnot generally known, although it is a fine looking and excellent\r\nflavoured fruit: it possesses a thin skin, orange-coloured flesh, and\r\nthe rind is very dark.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet Rock is, however, the finest flavoured melon that can be\r\nproduced, though small in its growth, seldom exceeding the weight of\r\nthree pounds, and commonly from one to two. The flesh is of a deep\r\nscarlet colour, and it is rather inclined to rock.\r\n\r\nThe Early Cantaloupe is the most productive melon in bearing; but in\r\norder to obtain them good flavoured no more than one fruit must be\r\nsuffered to swell on a plant at a time, except the lights are large,\r\nwhen two may be allowed, that is, six in a light; but if, however, the\r\nplants are confined to one fruit, a second crop may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe White-seeded Rock is a very fine melon in appearance, and much\r\napproved of by some gardeners for its qualities in ripening early for a\r\nrock; but it will not, however, keep long, soon loses its flavour, and\r\nthe colour changes very yellow; it is also extremely tender in its\r\ngrowth, and very inferior in flavour to the Stroud Rock; neither is it\r\nso handsome a fruit, so well-flavoured, nor does it ripen any sooner.\r\n\r\nThe Green Flesh is a fine flavoured melon, with a thin skin, but\r\ngenerally small in its dimensions. The Author has, however, a sort of\r\nthis kind that will grow from three to five pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nThe Black Rock melon should not be sown later than the latter end of\r\nMay; the Stroud and Scarlet Rock may be sown as late as the tenth of\r\nJune; and the Early Cantaloupe about the twentieth of June.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce fine fruit, be particular in having a good depth of\r\nearth, from a foot to eighteen inches will be necessary. When the hills\r\nare made for the very early melons, one large barrow-full of mould will\r\nbe sufficient, which must be pressed down close with the hand. Those\r\nthat are sown in March will require one barrow-full and a half, and\r\nthose afterwards two. In applying this mould, put one barrow-full in\r\nfirst, and tread it down; then add the remainder, and press it close\r\ndown with the hand. Procure some good holding loam of a greasy nature,\r\nsuch as is generally found in the marshes, which is the most preferable\r\nkind of soil for melons, and let it be well weathered before using. It\r\nought to lay twelve, or at the least six months. Mix this with a sixth\r\nproportion of good rotten dung or leaf mould, and let it be turned over\r\ntwo or three different times, that it may be properly sweetened and\r\nincorporated together; taking care, however, that it is not broken too\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nThe mould intended for the hills of the first crop should be lighter\r\nthan for those grown afterwards, being composed of light loam, mixed\r\nwith a sixth part of leaf mould or rotten dung; or an equal proportion\r\nof stiff loam and leaf mould. As mould is added after the plants have\r\nbeen ridged out, let it be trod down close, and take particular care\r\nthat the roots are never exposed to the sun, but as soon as they make\r\ntheir appearance through the hills, increase the mould, in the\r\nproportion of a barrow-full to each hill for the early melon, and two,\r\nor even more, to the later one.\r\n\r\nIn watering the plants, as the season advances, you must be regulated by\r\nthe composition of the soil, and the temperature of the weather. If the\r\nsoil is stiff, it will not require half the quantity that should be\r\napplied to light mould. If the weather is warm, much water is necessary,\r\nbut if cold very little should be given, as too much moisture at that\r\ntime will create the canker.\r\n\r\nHeat being materially requisite for preserving the growth of the melon,\r\ngreat care must be taken in keeping the bed well supplied with linings,\r\nwhich must be added until the weather becomes fine and settled; they\r\nwill generally be required until the beginning of June; but if the\r\nseason is even then cold, it is better to continue them longer.\r\n\r\nIn covering up the early plants, at the first ridging out, a single or\r\ndouble mat will be sufficient; after that add a little hay, and increase\r\nit if the weather is cold. This should be continued until the middle of\r\nJune, or later, if the season is unfavourable.\r\n\r\nMany gardeners being unacquainted with the proper mode of training and\r\ntopping the melon, and thereby finding it extremely difficult to set the\r\nfruit, the Author will here give the method always pursued by himself,\r\nwhich, if strictly observed, will be found to be attended with far less\r\ntrouble, and more certain in its effect than the plan generally adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are potted off, top them at the second break; that is,\r\nlet them grow to two leaves; then take out the break, which in some\r\nkinds is in the centre, and in others in the second leaf. If you require\r\nthe fruit very fine, two plants will be sufficient in a light; but\r\nshould there be no particular necessity in that respect, and the lights\r\nare sufficiently capacious, three may be matured extremely well.\r\n\r\nHave four runners to a light; that is, if two plants, two runners to\r\neach; but if three, two runners to one plant, and one to each of the\r\nother two. If the lights are large, they may be suffered to run to eight\r\njoints; but if, on the contrary, the lights are confined, six will be\r\nsufficient; and all other breaks that come out at home, with the first\r\nbreak that issues from the runners, should be effectually taken away, in\r\norder that the others may derive strength and nourishment. As soon as\r\nthey make the first breaks from the runners, which by some are\r\ndenominated cross bars, top them at the first joint, and in most sorts\r\nthey will generally show fruit; but if it should so happen that this\r\ndoes not succeed, top them again, when they are certain of showing fruit\r\nat the second.\r\n\r\nIf they are impregnated in the same manner as prescribed in the\r\ndirections for the cucumber, there will be no difficulty in setting the\r\nfruit, which will also show much bolder, and possess greater strength\r\nwhen topped in close.\r\n\r\nEvery description of melon will be brought to a greater degree of\r\nperfection, by being suffered to swell off on the first shows, which can\r\nalone be effected by keeping them thin of vine: if this is particularly\r\nattended to, no apprehension need be entertained of the fruit being\r\nsmall or delicate, as, in proportion to the quantity of vine, so it\r\ndecreases the strength and vigour of the plants.\r\n\r\nGreat care is necessary in watering the plants: when they are young, it\r\nshould be applied with a rose; but as soon as the runners are extended\r\nall over the bed, that may be dispensed with. If the weather is dull, a\r\nsmall quantity of water will be sufficient; and if very fine, more must\r\nbe applied carefully without a rose, which will be found beneficial in\r\ncausing them to set more freely.[8] An insufficiency of moisture is an\r\nerror too prevalent with many gardeners in the culture of the melon, and\r\nindeed the inferiority of their fruit, both in weight and flavour, may\r\nbe greatly attributed to want of judgment in this particular; for if the\r\nplants are kept thin of vine, the necessity of which has been before\r\nstated, they are of course more open to the air, and the sun has greater\r\npower in drying up the soil, consequently the plants will become\r\nexhausted, and the fruit will ripen before its growth is properly\r\nmatured.\r\n\r\nThe Early Cantaloupe melon, if left to its full time, will be five weeks\r\nfrom the period of setting before it ripens; the Stroud about six; the\r\nScarlet seven; and the Black Rock upwards of seven; there will, however,\r\nbe some difference between those forced early with bottom heat, and\r\nthose grown late; the early ones coming to perfection three or four\r\ndays, or even a week before the other.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to sow for under-ground melons, that is, such as are\r\ngrown without linings, is from the twenty-fifth of March to the\r\ntwentieth of June; observing, at the same time, that those which are\r\nsown in March will require stronger beds than those that are set three\r\nweeks or a month later.\r\n\r\nThe beds for the first should be formed of good dung, well worked, and\r\nthree feet in height; whereas the latter will only require two feet. Dig\r\na trench the size of the frame, about eighteen inches deep; and if the\r\nsoil is a strong good holding loam, it will answer the purpose for any\r\ndescription of rock melon; they requiring a strong soil to bring them to\r\nperfection; a light loam, however, may be used for the Early Cantaloupe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bed is formed, tread it down well, make it even, and let\r\nit have about six inches fall from the back to the front; then put on\r\nthe boxes and lights, and when the heat rises to its proper height,\r\nwhich will be in the course of three or four days, put the mould in for\r\nthe hills, in the proportion of two barrows-full to a light, levelling\r\nit about an inch all over the bed, for the purpose of preventing the\r\nrank steam from injuring the plants. On the following day they may be\r\nridged out, and watered, being very particular in sprinkling the bed\r\nregularly over. Admit air freely both night and day at first, until the\r\nbed is purified, and becomes perfectly sweet; this will be the case in\r\nabout a week, when they may be shut down at night. Let the topping and\r\ntraining be the same as directed for the early ones.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is strong, and of a binding nature, a bank may be made on\r\nthe outside, at the back and front, about a foot or eighteen inches\r\nwide, which will prove a great support to the fruit, and cause them to\r\ngrow much larger and finer; but if the soil is light and rich, by no\r\nmeans make a bank, nor ridge out the plants in it, as mould of that\r\ndescription is not at all adapted for the production of fine melons. The\r\nonly one that will in any degree thrive in light rich soil is the Early\r\nCantaloupe; but any kind of the rock description will never come to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nIt is here necessary to observe that it is impossible ever to obtain\r\nfine or good flavoured fruit, if more than one is suffered to swell on a\r\nplant at a time, as that support which is essential and ought to be\r\ndirected to one object, by becoming divided, is insufficient for the\r\nperfection of more, and naturally weakens the fruit, and renders it of\r\nlittle or no value.\r\n\r\nMany horticulturists experience much difficulty from the effects of the\r\nred spider and canker in melons; the former being caused by keeping them\r\ntoo dry, and the latter arising from too much moisture. In order to\r\navoid these evils, the following directions should be particularly\r\nattended to. When the weather is hot, or there is a strong bottom heat,\r\nit is necessary to be free in the application of water, especially round\r\nthe sides of the boxes; for when the plants cover the bed, it will not\r\nbe requisite to give any in the centre over the stems.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants cover the surface of the bed always water without a\r\nrose, observing that it should be invariably done in the morning, and\r\nwhen the weather is fine, so as to allow the vines to get dry before\r\nnight, which will not be the case, if it is applied in the afternoon;\r\nand should the following day be dull, and perhaps continue so for three\r\nor four, the vines will remain wet, and then there is every probability\r\nof their getting the canker, which entirely proceeds from a cold chill,\r\ncreated by unnecessary moisture.\r\n\r\nThe canker is a very destructive disorder, and extremely difficult to\r\neradicate. The only means that can be adopted, or likely to prove\r\nbeneficial, is to keep the plants as dry as possible, and to give a good\r\nheat; being careful, at the same time, not to run into the other\r\nextreme, and create the red spider. If, however, the plants are kept\r\nthin of vine, and water is applied in the manner before directed, no\r\nfear need be entertained of either of the above disorders.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The Author has in his possession a sort of this description, from\r\nwhich he has produced fruit upwards of ten pounds in weight.\r\n\r\n[8] As the season advances, and the sun becomes powerful, it will be\r\nnecessary to shade them from the extreme violence of the heat. Mats are\r\ngenerally made use of, but the Author considers evergreen boughs far\r\npreferable, as the former entirely precludes the sun, whereas the latter\r\nis beneficial to the plants, in admitting it partially. This will be\r\ngenerally requisite from about ten until two; and at that time, in\r\nproportion to the degree of shade, a larger quantity of air must be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF THE BOXES AND LIGHTS FOR\r\n\r\nEarly and late Melons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boxes and Lights for the first early Melons._\r\n\r\nThe wood-work should be of the same thickness, as those directed for\r\nearly cucumbers, and the boxes of the same length; but two feet deep at\r\nthe back, five feet wide, and one foot three inches in the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Melons sown from the middle of February until the latter end of\r\nMarch, grown with linings._\r\n\r\nThe boxes and lights to be the same in thickness, length, and depth;\r\nfive feet six inches wide; four bars to a light, with a small iron bar\r\nacross the middle, in the inside, under the lead-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For late Melons, grown without Linings._\r\n\r\nThe boxes and lights to be the same as those before described, with the\r\nexception of being eighteen inches deep at the back, by eleven inches in\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brick Pits._\r\n\r\nLet these be formed of nine inch brick-work, sunk one foot under-ground;\r\nfive feet high at the back, by three feet six inches in the front, from\r\nthe bottom; and six feet wide in the inside. Let the lights be three\r\nfeet eight inches wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY S. CAVE, ISLINGTON GREEN.",
