Many varieties of trees, shrubs, and\r\nflowering herbs clothe steep canyon walls. Shady glens, alive with\r\nbirds, are frowned upon by rows of strange massive spires, turrets, and\r\nbattlements in this fascinating wonderland of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeological Story\r\n\r\nWhat geological forces created these striking and peculiar pinnacles and\r\nbalanced rocks? Geologists explain that millions of years ago volcanic\r\nactivity was extensive throughout this region. A series of explosive\r\neruptions covered the level area with layers of volcanic rock fragments.\r\nMany years elapsed between such periods of activity, resulting in a\r\nseries of blankets, layer upon layer. Since the eruptions varied in\r\nmagnitude, the resulting deposits were of different thickness.\r\n\r\nFinally, the eruptions ceased, and were followed by movements in the\r\nearth's crust which slowly lifted and tilted great rock masses to form\r\nmountains. The stresses responsible for the movements caused a definite\r\npattern of vertical cracks. Storms and other agencies of erosion,\r\nespecially running water carrying small particles of rock, immediately\r\nset to work on the long, slow task of wearing down these mountains.\r\nShallow canyons became deeper and more rugged as time passed. Weathered\r\nrock formed soil which collected in pockets, and plant life gained a\r\nfoothold.\r\n\r\nWhere previous volcanic activity had spread sheets of lava, the\r\nmountains were now capped with layers of volcanic rock. Along the\r\nvertical cracks and lines of horizontal weakness, erosion began its\r\npersistent work. Cracks were widened to form fissures; fissures grew to\r\nbreaches. Undercutting slowly took place. Gradually the lava masses were\r\ncut by millions of erosional channels into blocks of a multitude of\r\nsizes and shapes to be further sculptured by the elements.\r\n\r\nErosion is still going on slowly and persistently among the great\r\npillared cliffs of the monument. Some of the most exposed portions have\r\nalready been worn away. Pedestal or balanced rocks have formed and\r\nfallen; others are tottering; more are just taking shape. Within the\r\nspan of a human life, only minor changes may be noticed, but with the\r\npassage of the centuries the face of Nature is ever changing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the spectacular erosional remnants and the massive columnar\r\nstructure of the cliffs will impress you even if you hurry through, you\r\nwill see much more of geological interest if you can stop and use the\r\ntrail. Here and there are exposed beds of volcanic ash and cinders,\r\nindicating the explosive nature of some of the ancient eruptions. Road\r\nconstruction has uncovered shale which was once the mud of a lake bed.\r\nOne trail is strewn with \"volcanic hailstones\" weathered out of a ledge\r\ncomposed of millions of marblelike pellets firmly cemented together into\r\na peculiar \"peanut-brittle\" rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant and Animal Life\r\n\r\nBecause of its location as a mountainous island in a sea of arid\r\ngrassland, the Chiricahua Range affords a haven for a multitude of\r\nplants and animals of many varieties. Winter snows and summer rains\r\nresult in springs and small streams. Dense vegetation covers the shaded\r\ncanyon bottoms and the cool north slopes of the higher elevations. In\r\ncontrast, south exposures feel the full heat of the summer sun and have\r\nplants characteristic of the desert. Red-stemmed manzanitas and\r\nbark-shedding madrones rub branches with the chalky-white limbs of the\r\nsycamore and the feathery gray foliage of the Arizona cypress. Green\r\nslopes, covered by chaparral of scrub oak and manzanita, face open\r\nhillsides dotted with a desert vegetation of yuccas, century plants, and\r\ncactuses. Seasonal changes bring with them many varieties of\r\nwildflowers.\r\n\r\nArizona whitetail deer are numerous in the Chiricahuas, and in the\r\nmonument, where they are protected, they become accustomed to man and\r\nare frequently seen. Coatimundi and peccary are increasing in numbers.\r\nRodents are common, as are birds of many species. Each vegetative belt\r\nand plant association has its own distinctive animal population, some of\r\nwhich are unique because of the relative and long-established isolation\r\nof the Chiricahua Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Background\r\n\r\nWhat student of American history has not heard of Geronimo, famous\r\nwarrior of the Chiricahua Apache Indians? When, in 1886, Geronimo and\r\nhis band finally surrendered to United States soldiers, there ended one\r\nof the most stubborn phases of aboriginal resistance to white\r\ndomination. The Chiricahua Mountains and their neighboring ranges were\r\nthe ancestral home of the nomadic Apache Indians. Living mainly on wild\r\nanimals and native plants, these resourceful people moved from place to\r\nplace depending upon the requirements of the season and the supply of\r\nfood. Occasionally they raided the farmer Indians of the desert valleys,\r\nand with the coming of the Spaniards, they found increased incentive to\r\npillage the European cattle, horses, and grains introduced by the white\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nStolen horses greatly increased the power and widened the range of\r\nIndian activities, and the southeastern corner of what is now Arizona\r\nbecame an Apache stronghold. With the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 and the\r\nopening of settlement of the region to United States citizens, the\r\nApache raiders became more and more a hazard. United States troops were\r\ndispatched to the Southwest to protect settlers, prospectors, travelers,\r\nand the mail- and passenger-carrying stages of the Butterfield Route\r\nwhich were often attacked. Cavalry camps and bases were established. One\r\nof the most famous of these, Fort Bowie, established in 1862, commanded\r\nstrategic Apache Pass at the end of the Chiricahua Mountains, north of\r\nthe monument. From 1860 until 1872, the Chiricahua Apaches under the\r\nleadership of the wily Cochise matched the strategy of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the Chiricahua Apaches were finally rounded up and placed on a\r\nreservation, but hostilities continued to flare up when bands left the\r\nreservation to attack travelers and pillage isolated ranches. Geronimo,\r\nwho was the most persistent and cunning of the leaders, was captured in\r\n1886. This ended the organized resistance of the Chiricahua Apaches, but\r\n\"Big Foot\" Massai staged several one-man escapades in later years.\r\nCochise Head, just north of the monument, and Massai Point and Massai\r\nCanyon, within its boundaries, immortalize the names of two of the\r\nfamous Apaches of the Chiricahua group.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monument\r\n\r\nChiricahua National Monument, established by Presidential proclamation\r\non April 18, 1924, has an area of nearly 17 square miles. Elevations\r\nwithin the monument range from 5,160 to 7,365 feet above sea level. The\r\nmonument entrance, which is on the west, is reached by roads from Bowie\r\nand Willcox, or by paved roads from Douglas and Bisbee.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Geronimo, famous warrior of the Chiricahua Apaches.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Your Visit\r\n\r\nYou may obtain information and can register at monument headquarters,\r\nabout 1 mile beyond the entrance. There is a small exhibit room here,\r\nand free interpretive service is provided. When personnel is available,\r\nvisitors are accompanied to points of interest by park rangers who\r\nexplain the geologic phenomena.\r\n\r\nA paved mountain road will take you up scenic Bonita Canyon to Massai\r\nPoint from which you can get an extensive view of the monument and of\r\nthe Sulfur Springs Valley to the west and San Simon Valley on the east.\r\nThe geological story is told at the Massai Point Exhibit Building. For\r\nadded enjoyment, we suggest you take one or more of the following trips:\r\n\r\n_Massai Point Trail._--A self-guiding trail. Interesting features\r\ninclude a balanced rock, lookout point with telescope, and Transition\r\nLife Zone plants. Secure leaflet at the Exhibit Building. Time, 20 to 30\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Echo Canyon._--One of the most scenic sections of the monument. The\r\nwalk of 1¼ miles to Echo Park is very spectacular.\r\n\r\n_Heart of Rocks._--A nice 4- or 5-hour hike to interesting rock\r\nformations, such as Punch and Judy and Big Balanced Rock. Take water.\r\n\r\n_Sugarloaf Peak._--One of the highest points in the monument with an\r\nextensive view of entire region. One mile from Sugarloaf parking area by\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\n_Foothill Forest Trail._--A self-guiding trail, starting at the museum\r\nparking area, will take you past plants of the Upper and Lower Sonoran\r\nLife Zones. Time, 15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Horseback Trip._--Horses are available at the Faraway Ranch and all\r\ntrails are open to horseback parties.\r\n\r\nThere is a campground in Bonita Canyon, one-half mile above monument\r\nheadquarters, at 5,340 feet elevation. Drinking water, fireplaces, wood,\r\nand picnic tables at 30 campsites; restrooms, showers, and laundry room\r\nare centrally located. Campers may heat water for showers or laundry in\r\na wood-burning waterheater. Although the campground is open all year,\r\nshower rooms may be closed during freezing weather.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"Punch and Judy.\"]\r\n\r\nTemperatures are generally moderate--the mean daily temperature in\r\nJanuary is 40° and in July, 74°. Most of the average yearly\r\nprecipitation of 18 inches occurs during the rainy season of July and\r\nAugust. Except for light snowfall in winter, the rest of the year is\r\ncomparatively dry.\r\n\r\nCamping and picnicking are restricted to the campground area. As wood is\r\nprovided here, the gathering of firewood is prohibited.\r\n\r\nHousetrailers can be accommodated, but no special facilities, such as\r\nelectricity, are available. There is a 30-day limit on camping, which\r\nmay be reduced during periods of heavy use. All pets must be leashed or\r\nkept in a vehicle.\r\n\r\nMeals and lodging can be obtained at Silver Spur Ranch and housekeeping\r\ncabins and meals at the Faraway Ranch, both of which are on private\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"Duck on a Rock.\"]\r\n\r\n_Hunting, or injury to any plant, animal, or feature of the monument, is\r\nprohibited._\r\n\r\n\r\nMission 66\r\n\r\nMission 66 is a program designed to be completed by 1966 which will\r\nassure the maximum protection of the scenic, scientific, wilderness, and\r\nhistoric resources of the National Park System in such ways and by such\r\nmeans as will make them available for the use and enjoyment of present\r\nand future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdministration\r\n\r\nChiricahua National Monument is administered by the National Park\r\nService, U. S. Department of the Interior. A superintendent, whose\r\naddress is Dos Cabezas, Ariz., is in immediate charge.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: U. S.
