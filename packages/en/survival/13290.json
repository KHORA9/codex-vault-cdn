There, to relieve his home-sickness, he first\r\npractised his pen in long letters home to his mother. Soon after his\r\nreturn to Scotland in 1848 he published a first book on Hudson's Bay.\r\nThen he passed some years in a Scottish publisher's office; and in 1855 a\r\nchance suggestion from another publisher led to his writing his first\r\nbook for boys--\"Snowflakes and Sunbeams, or The Young Fur Traders.\" That\r\nstory showed he had found his vocation, and he poured forth its\r\nsuccessors to the tune in all of some fourscore volumes. \"Martin Rattler\"\r\nappeared in 1858. In his \"Personal Reminiscences\" Ballantyne wrote: \"How\r\nmany thousands of lads have an intense liking for the idea of a sailor's\r\nlife!\" and he pointed out there the other side of the romantic picture:\r\nthe long watches \"in dirty unromantic weather,\" and the hard work of\r\nholystoning the decks, scraping down the masts and cleaning out the\r\ncoal-hole. But though his books show something of this reverse side too,\r\nthere is no doubt they have helped to set many boys dreaming of\r\n\r\n\"Wrecks, buccaneers, black flags, and desert lands\r\nOn which, alone, the second Crusoe stands.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Note to \"The Coral Island\" in this series.]\r\n\r\nAmong these persuasions to the life of adventure \"Martin Rattler\" is\r\nstill one of the favourite among all his books. Ballantyne himself was\r\nfated to die on foreign soil in 1894, at Rome, where he lies buried in\r\nthe English Protestant cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Ballantyne's chief romances, tales of\r\nadventure, and descriptive works:--\r\n\r\n\"Hudson's Bay, or Every-day Life in the Wilds of North America,\" etc.,\r\n1848; \"Snowflakes and Sunbeams, or the Young Fur Traders,\" 1856.

With this single remark I commit my work to your\r\nhands, and wish you a pleasant ramble, in spirit, through the romantic\r\nforests of Brazil.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nR.M. BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n[October, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN RATTLER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE HERO AND HIS ONLY RELATIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Rattler was a very bad boy. At least his aunt, Mrs. Dorothy\r\nGrumbit, said so; and certainly she ought to have known, if anybody\r\nshould, for Martin lived with her, and was, as she herself expressed it,\r\n\"the bane of her existence,--the very torment of her life.\" No doubt of\r\nit whatever, according to Aunt Dorothy Grumbit's showing, Martin Rattler\r\nwas \"a remarkably bad boy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, however, that, although most of the people in the\r\nvillage of Ashford seemed to agree with Mrs. Grumbit in her opinion of\r\nMartin, there were very few of them who did not smile cheerfully on the\r\nchild when they met him, and say, \"Good day, lad!\" as heartily as if they\r\nthought him the best boy in the place. No one seemed to bear Martin\r\nRattler ill-will, notwithstanding his alleged badness. Men laughed when\r\nthey said he was a bad boy, as if they did not quite believe their own\r\nassertion. The vicar, an old whiteheaded man, with a kind, hearty\r\ncountenance, said that the child was full of mischief, full of mischief;\r\nbut he would improve as he grew older, he was quite certain of that. And\r\nthe vicar was a good judge, for he had five boys of his own, besides\r\nthree other boys, the sons of a distant relative, who boarded with him;\r\nand he had lived forty years in a parish overflowing with boys, and he\r\nwas particularly fond of boys in general. Not so the doctor, a pursy\r\nlittle man with a terrific frown, who hated boys, especially little ones,\r\nwith a very powerful hatred. The doctor said that Martin was a scamp.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Martin had not the appearance of a scamp. He had fat rosy cheeks,\r\na round rosy mouth, a straight delicately-formed nose, a firm massive\r\nchin, and a broad forehead. But the latter was seldom visible, owing to\r\nthe thickly-clustering fair curls that overhung it. When asleep Martin's\r\nface was the perfection of gentle innocence. But the instant he opened\r\nhis dark-brown eyes, a thousand dimples and wrinkles played over his\r\nvisage, chiefly at the corners of his mouth and round his eyes; as if the\r\nspirit of fun and the spirit of mischief had got entire possession of the\r\nboy, and were determined to make the most of him. When deeply interested\r\nin anything, Martin was as grave and serious as a philosopher.\r\n\r\nAunt Dorothy Grumbit had a turned-up nose,--a very much turned-up nose;\r\nso much so, indeed, that it presented a front view of the nostrils! It\r\nwas an aggravating nose, too for the old lady's spectacles refused to\r\nrest on any part of it except the extreme point. Mrs. Grumbit invariably\r\nplaced them on the right part of her nose, and they as invariably slid\r\ndown the curved slope until they were brought up by the little hillock at\r\nthe end. There they condescended to repose in peace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grumbit was mild, and gentle, and little, and thin, and\r\nold,--perhaps seventy-five; but no one knew her age for certain, not even\r\nherself. She wore an old-fashioned, high-crowned cap, and a gown of\r\nbed-curtain chintz, with flowers on it the size of a saucer. It was a\r\ncurious gown, and very cheap, for Mrs. Grumbit was poor. No one knew the\r\nextent of her poverty, any more than they did her age; but she herself\r\nknew it, and felt it deeply,--never so deeply, perhaps, as when her\r\norphan nephew Martin grew old enough to be put to school, and she had not\r\nwherewithal to send him. But love is quick-witted and resolute. A\r\nresidence of six years in Germany had taught her to knit stockings at a\r\nrate that cannot be described, neither conceived unless seen. She knitted\r\ntwo dozen pairs. The vicar took one dozen, the doctor took the other. The\r\nfact soon became known. Shops were not numerous in the village in those\r\ndays; and the wares they supplied were only second rate. Orders came\r\npouring in, Mrs. Grumbit's knitting wires clicked, and her little old\r\nhands wagged with incomprehensible rapidity and unflagging\r\nregularity,--and Martin Rattler was sent to school.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied with her knitting, she sat in a high-backed chair in a\r\nvery small deep window, through which the sun streamed nearly the whole\r\nday; and out of which there was the most charming imaginable view of the\r\ngardens and orchards of the villagers, with a little dancing brook in the\r\nmidst, and the green fields of the farmers beyond, studded with sheep and\r\ncattle and knolls of woodland, and bounded in the far distance by the\r\nbright blue sea. It was a lovely scene, such an one as causes the eye to\r\nbrighten and the heart to melt as we gaze upon it, and think, perchance,\r\nof its Creator.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a scene worth looking at; but Mrs. Grumbit never looked at\r\nit, for the simple reason that she could not have seen it if she had.\r\nHalf way across her own little parlour was the extent of her natural\r\nvision. By the aid of spectacles and a steady concentrated effort, she\r\ncould see the fire-place at the other end of the room; and the portrait\r\nof her deceased husband, who had been a sea-captain; and the white kitten\r\nthat usually sat on the rug before the fire. To be sure she saw them very\r\nindistinctly. The picture was a hazy blue patch, which was the captain's\r\ncoat; with a white patch down the middle of it, which was his waistcoat;\r\nand a yellow ball on the top of it, which was his head. It was rather an\r\nindistinct and generalized view, no doubt; but she _saw_ it, and that was\r\na great comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN DISGRACE\r\n\r\n\r\nFire was the cause of Martin's getting into disgrace at school for the\r\nfirst time; and this is how it happened.\r\n\r\n\"Go and poke the fire, Martin Rattler,\" said the school-master, \"and put\r\non a bit of coal, and see that you don't send the sparks flying about\r\nthe floor.\"\r\n\r\nMartin sprang with alacrity to obey; for he was standing up with the\r\nclass at the time, and was glad of the temporary relaxation. He stirred\r\nthe fire with great care, and put on several pieces of coal very slowly,\r\nand rearranged them two or three times; after which he stirred the fire a\r\nlittle more, and examined it carefully to see that it was all right; but\r\nhe did not seem quite satisfied, and was proceeding to re-adjust the\r\ncoals when Bob Croaker, one of the big boys, who was a bullying,\r\nill-tempered fellow, and had a spite against Martin, called out,--\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, Rattler's playin' at the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back to your place, sir!\" cried the master, sternly.\r\n\r\nMartin returned in haste, and resumed his position in the class. As he\r\ndid so he observed that his fore-finger was covered with soot.\r\nImmediately a smile of glee overspread his features; and, while the\r\nmaster was busy with one of the boys, he drew his black finger gently\r\ndown the forehead and nose of the boy next to him.\r\n\r\n\"What part of the earth was peopled by the descendants of Ham?\" cried the\r\nmaster, pointing to the dux.\r\n\r\n\"Shem!\" shrieked a small boy near the foot of the class.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" thundered the master, with a frown that caused the small boy\r\nto quake down to the points of his toes.\r\n\r\n\"Asia!\" answered dux.\r\n\r\n\"Next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Turkey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Next, next, next? Hallo! John Ward,\" cried the master, starting up in\r\nanger from his seat, \"what do you mean by that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, sir?\" said John Ward, tremulously, while a suppressed titter ran\r\nround the class.\r\n\r\n\"Your face, sir! Who blacked your face, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--don't know,\" said the boy, drawing his sleeve across his face,\r\nwhich had the effect of covering it with sooty streaks.\r\n\r\nAn uncontrollable shout of laughter burst from the whole school, which\r\nwas instantly followed by a silence so awful and profound that a pin\r\nmight have been heard to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Martin Rattler, you did that! I know you did,--I see the marks on your\r\nfingers. Come here, sir! Now tell me; _did_ you do it?\"\r\n\r\nMartin Rattler never told falsehoods. His old aunt had laboured to\r\nimpress upon him from infancy that to lie was to commit a sin which is\r\nabhorred by God and scorned by man; and her teaching had not been in\r\nvain. The child would have suffered any punishment rather than have told\r\na deliberate lie. He looked straight in the master's face and said, \"Yes,\r\nsir, I did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, go to your seat, and remain in school during the play-hour.\"\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart Martin obeyed; and soon after the school was\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Rattler,\" whispered Bob Croaker, as he passed, \"I'm going to\r\nteach your white kitten to swim just now. Won't you come and see it?\"\r\n\r\nThe malicious laugh with which the boy accompanied this remark convinced\r\nMartin that he intended to put his threat in execution. For a moment he\r\nthought of rushing out after him to protect his pet kitten; but a glance\r\nat the stern brow of the master, as he sat at his desk reading,\r\nrestrained him; so, crushing down his feelings of mingled fear and anger,\r\nhe endeavoured to while away the time by watching the boys as they played\r\nin the fields before the windows of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Martin!\" said the school-master, in a severe tone, looking up from the\r\nbook with which he was engaged, \"don't look out at the window, sir; turn\r\nyour back to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, I can't help it,\" replied the boy, trembling with eagerness\r\nas he stared across the fields.\r\n\r\n\"Turn your back on it, I say!\" reiterated the master in a loud tone, at\r\nthe same time striking the desk violently with his cane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, let me out! There's Bob Croaker with my kitten. He's going to\r\ndrown it. I know he is,--he said he would; and if he does aunty will die,\r\nfor she loves it next to me; and I _must_ save it, and--and, if you\r\n_don't_ let me out--you'll be a murderer!\"\r\n\r\nAt this concluding burst, Martin sprang forward and stood before his\r\nmaster with clenched fists and a face blazing with excitement. The\r\nschoolmaster's gaze of astonishment gradually gave place to a dark frown\r\nstrangely mingled with a smile, and, when the boy concluded, he said\r\nquietly--\"You may go.\"\r\n\r\nNo second bidding was needed. The door flew open with a bang; and the\r\ngravel of the play-ground, spurned right and left, dashed against the\r\nwindow panes as Martin flew across it. The paling that fenced it off from\r\nthe fields beyond was low, but too high for a jump. Never a boy in all\r\nthe school had crossed that paling at a spring, without laying his hands\r\nupon it; but Martin did. We do not mean to say that he did anything\r\nsuperhuman; but he rushed at it like a charge of cavalry, sprang from the\r\nground like a deer, kicked away the top bar, tumbled completely over,\r\nlanded on his head, and rolled down the slope on the other side as fast\r\nas he could have run down,--perhaps faster.\r\n\r\nIt would have required sharper eyes than yours or mine to have observed\r\nhow Martin got on his legs again, but he did it in a twinkling, and was\r\nhalf across the field almost before you could wink, and panting on the\r\nheels of Bob Croaker. Bob saw him coming and instantly started off at a\r\nhard run, followed by the whole school. A few minutes brought them to the\r\nbanks of the stream, where Bob Croaker halted, and, turning round, held\r\nthe white kitten up by the nape of the neck.\r\n\r\n\"O spare it! spare it, Bob!--don't do it--please don't, don't do it!\"\r\ngasped Martin, as he strove in vain to run faster.\r\n\r\n\"There you go!\" shouted Bob, with a coarse laugh, sending the kitten high\r\ninto the air, whence it fell with a loud splash into the water.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful shock to feline nerves, no doubt, but that white kitten\r\nwas no ordinary animal. Its little heart beat bravely when it rose to the\r\nsurface, and, before its young master came up, it had regained the bank.\r\nBut, alas! what a change! It went into the stream a fat, round,\r\ncomfortable ball of eider-down. It came out--a scraggy blotch of white\r\npaint, with its black eyes glaring like two great glass beads! No sooner\r\ndid it crawl out of the water than Bob Croaker seized it, and whirled it\r\nround his head, amid suppressed cries of \"Shame!\" intending to throw it\r\nin again; but at that instant Martin Rattler seized Bob by the collar of\r\nhis coat with both hands, and, letting himself drop suddenly, dragged the\r\ncruel boy to the ground, while the kitten crept humbly away and hid\r\nitself in a thick tuft of grass.\r\n\r\nA moment sufficed to enable Bob Croaker, who was nearly twice Martin's\r\nweight, to free himself from the grasp of his panting antagonist, whom he\r\nthrew on his back, and doubled his fist, intending to strike Martin on\r\nthe face; but a general rush of the boys prevented this.\r\n\r\n\"Shame, shame, fair play!\" cried several; \"don't hit him when he's down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let him rise up and come on!\" cried Bob, fiercely, as he sprang up\r\nand released Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's fair. Now then, Martin, remember the kitten!\"\r\n\r\n\"Strike men of your own size!\" cried several of the bigger boys, as they\r\ninterposed to prevent Martin from rushing into the unequal contest.\r\n\r\n\"So I will,\" cried Bob Croaker, glaring round with passion. \"Come on any\r\nof you that likes. I don't care a button for the biggest of you.\"\r\n\r\nNo one accepted this challenge, for Bob was the oldest and the strongest\r\nboy in the school, although, as is usually the case with bullies, by no\r\nmeans the bravest.\r\n\r\nSeeing that no one intended to fight with him, and that a crowd of boys\r\nstrove to hold Martin Rattler back, while they assured him that he had\r\nnot the smallest chance in the world, Bob turned towards the kitten,\r\nwhich was quietly and busily employed in licking itself dry, and said,\r\n\"Now, Martin, you coward, I'll give it another swim for your impudence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried Martin earnestly. \"Bob Croaker, I would rather do\r\nanything than fight. I would give you everything I have to save my\r\nkitten; but if you won't spare it unless I fight, I'll do it. If you\r\nthrow it in before you fight me, you're the greatest coward that ever\r\nwalked. Just give me five minutes to breathe and a drink of water, and\r\nI'll fight you as long as I can stand.\"\r\n\r\nBob looked at his little foe in surprise. \"Well, that's fair. I'm your\r\nman; but if you don't lick me I'll drown the kitten, that's all.\" Having\r\nsaid this, he quietly divested himself of his jacket and neckcloth, while\r\nseveral boys assisted Martin to do the same, and brought him a draught of\r\nwater in the crown of one of their caps. In five minutes all was ready,\r\nand the two boys stood face to face and foot to foot, with their fists\r\ndoubled and revolving, and a ring of boys around them.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the kitten, having found the process of licking\r\nitself dry more fatiguing than it had expected, gave vent to a faint mew\r\nof distress. It was all that was wanting to set Martin's indignant heart\r\ninto a blaze of inexpressible fury. Bob Croaker's visage instantly\r\nreceived a shower of sharp, stinging blows, that had the double effect of\r\ntaking that youth by surprise and throwing him down upon the green sward.\r\nBut Martin could not hope to do this a second time. Bob now knew the\r\nvigour of his assailant, and braced himself warily to the combat,\r\ncommencing operations by giving Martin a tremendous blow on the point of\r\nhis nose, and another on the chest. These had the effect of tempering\r\nMartin's rage with a salutary degree of caution, and of eliciting from\r\nthe spectators sundry cries of warning on the one hand, and admiration on\r\nthe other, while the young champions revolved warily round each other,\r\nand panted vehemently.\r\n\r\nThe battle that was fought that day was one of a thousand. It created as\r\ngreat a sensation in the village school as did the battle of Waterloo in\r\nEngland. It was a notable fight; such as had not taken place within the\r\nmemory of the oldest boy in the village, and from which, in after years,\r\nevents of juvenile history were dated,--especially pugilistic events, of\r\nwhich, when a good one came off, it used to be said that \"such a battle\r\nhad not taken place since the year of the _Great Fight_\" Bob Croaker was\r\na noted fighter. Martin Rattler was, up to this date, an untried hero.\r\nAlthough fond of rough play and boisterous mischief, he had an\r\nunconquerable aversion to _earnest_ fighting, and very rarely indeed\r\nreturned home with a black eye,--much to the satisfaction of Aunt Dorothy\r\nGrumbit, who objected to all fighting from principle, and frequently\r\nasserted, in gentle tones, that there should be no soldiers or sailors\r\n(fighting sailors, she meant) at all, but that people ought all to settle\r\neverything the best way they could without fighting, and live peaceably\r\nwith one another, as the Bible told them to do. They would be far happier\r\nand better off, she was sure of that; and if everybody was of her way of\r\nthinking, there would be neither swords, nor guns, nor pistols, nor\r\nsquibs, nor anything else at all! Dear old lady. It would indeed be a\r\nblessing if her principles could be carried out in this warring and\r\njarring world. But as this is rather difficult, what we ought to be\r\ncareful about is, that we never fight except in a good cause and with a\r\nclear conscience.\r\n\r\nIt was well for Martin Rattler, on that great day, that the formation of\r\nthe ground favoured him. The spot on which the fight took place was\r\nuneven, and covered with little hillocks and hollows, over which Bob\r\nCroaker stumbled, and into which he fell,--being a clumsy boy on his\r\nlegs,--and did himself considerable damage; while Martin, who was firmly\r\nknit and active as a kitten, scarcely ever fell, or, if he did, sprang up\r\nagain like an India-rubber ball. Fair-play was embedded deep in the\r\ncentre of Martin's heart, so that he scorned to hit his adversary when he\r\nwas down or in the act of rising; but the thought of the fate that\r\nawaited the white kitten if he were conquered, acted like lightning in\r\nhis veins, and scarcely had Bob time to double his fists after a fall,\r\nwhen he was knocked back again into the hollow out of which he had risen.\r\nThere were no _rounds_ in this fight,--no pausing to recover breath.\r\nMartin's anger rose with every blow, whether given or received; and\r\nalthough he was knocked down flat four or five times, he rose again, and,\r\nwithout a second's delay, rushed headlong at his enemy. Feeling that he\r\nwas too little and light to make much impression on Bob Croaker by means\r\nof mere blows, he endeavoured as much as possible to throw his weight\r\nagainst him at each assault; but Bob stood his ground well, and after a\r\ntime seemed even to be recovering strength a little.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he made a rush at Martin, and, dealing him a successful blow on\r\nthe forehead, knocked him down; at the same time he himself tripped over\r\na molehill and fell upon his face. Both were on their legs in an instant.\r\nMartin grew desperate. The white kitten swimming for its life seemed to\r\nrise before him, and new energy was infused into his frame. He retreated\r\na step or two, and then darted forward like an arrow from a bow. Uttering\r\na loud cry, he sprang completely in the air and plunged--head and fists\r\ntogether, as if he were taking a dive--into Bob Croaker's bosom! The\r\neffect was tremendous. Bob went down like a shock of grain before the\r\nsickle; and having, in their prolonged movements, approached close to the\r\nbrink of the stream, both he and Martin went with a sounding splash into\r\nthe deep pool and disappeared. It was but for a moment, however, Martin's\r\nhead emerged first, with eyes and mouth distended to the utmost.\r\nInstantly, on finding bottom, he turned to deal his opponent another\r\nblow; but it was not needed. When Bob Croaker's head rose to the surface\r\nthere was no motion in the features, and the eyes were closed. The\r\nintended blow was changed into a friendly grasp; and, exerting himself to\r\nthe utmost, Martin dragged his insensible school-fellow to the bank,\r\nwhere, in a few minutes, he recovered sufficiently to declare in a sulky\r\ntone that he would fight no more!\r\n\r\n\"Bob Croaker,\" said Martin, holding out his hand, \"I'm sorry we've had to\r\nfight. I wouldn't have done it, but to save my kitten. You compelled me\r\nto do it, you know that. Come, let's be friends again.\"\r\n\r\nBob made no reply, but slowly and with some difficulty put on his vest\r\nand jacket.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure,\" continued Martin, \"there's no reason in bearing me ill-will.\r\nI've done nothing unfair, and I'm very sorry we've had to fight. Won't\r\nyou shake hands?\"\r\n\r\nBob was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Bob!\" cried several of the bigger boys, \"don't be sulky,\r\nman; shake hands and be friends. Martin has licked you this time, and\r\nyou'll lick him next time, no doubt, and that's all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, then, ye're out there, intirely. Bob Croaker'll niver lick Martin\r\nRattler though he wos to live to the age of the great M'Thuselah!'\" said\r\na deep-toned voice close to the spot where the fight had taken place.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence it proceeded, and\r\nthe boys now became aware, for the first time, that the combat had been\r\nwitnessed by a sailor, who, with a smile of approval beaming on his\r\ngood-humoured countenance, sat under the shade of a neighbouring tree\r\nsmoking a pipe of that excessive shortness and blackness that seems to be\r\npeculiarly beloved by Irishmen in the humbler ranks of life. The man was\r\nvery tall and broad-shouldered, and carried himself with a free-and-easy\r\nswagger, as he rose and approached the group of boys.\r\n\r\n\"He'll niver bate ye, Martin, avic, as long as there's two timbers of ye\r\nhouldin' togither.\"\r\n\r\nThe seaman patted Martin on the head as he spoke; and, turning to Bob\r\nCroaker, continued: \"Ye ought to be proud, ye spalpeen, o' bein' wopped\r\nby sich a young hero as this. Come here and shake hands with him: d'ye\r\nhear? Troth an' it's besmearin' ye with too much honour that same. There,\r\nthat'll do. Don't say ye're sorry now, for it's lies ye'd be tellin' if\r\nye did. Come along, Martin, an' I'll convarse with ye as ye go home.\r\nYe'll be a man yet, as sure as my name is Barney O'Flannagan.\"\r\n\r\nMartin took the white kitten in his arms and thrust its wet little body\r\ninto his equally wet bosom, where the warmth began soon to exercise a\r\nsoothing influence on the kitten's depressed spirits, so that, ere long,\r\nit began to purr. He then walked with the sailor towards the village,\r\nwith his face black and blue, and swelled and covered with blood, while\r\nBob Croaker and his companions returned to the school.\r\n\r\nThe distance to Martin's residence was not great, but it was sufficient\r\nto enable the voluble Irishman to recount a series of the most wonderful\r\nadventures and stories of foreign lands, that set Martin's heart on fire\r\nwith desire to go to sea,--a desire which was by no means new to him, and\r\nwhich recurred violently every time he paid a visit to the small sea-port\r\nof Bilton, which lay about five miles to the southward of his native\r\nvillage. Moreover, Barney suggested that it was time Martin should be\r\ndoing for himself (he was now ten years old), and said that if he would\r\njoin his ship, he could get him a berth, for he was much in want of an\r\nactive lad to help him with the coppers. But Martin Rattler sighed\r\ndeeply, and said that, although his heart was set upon going to sea, he\r\ndid not see how it was to be managed, for his aunt would not let him go.\r\n\r\nBefore they separated, however, it was arranged that Martin should pay\r\nthe sailor's ship a visit, when he would hear a good deal more about\r\nforeign lands; and that, in the meantime, he should make another attempt\r\nto induce Aunt Dorothy Grumbit to give her consent to his going to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA LESSON TO ALL STOCKING-KNITTERS--MARTIN'S PROSPECTS BEGIN TO OPEN UP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the small sea-port of Bilton, before mentioned, there dwelt an old and\r\nwealthy merchant and ship-owner, who devoted a small portion of his time\r\nto business, and a very large portion of it to what is usually termed\r\n\"doing good,\" This old gentleman was short, and stout, and rosy, and\r\nbald, and active, and sharp as a needle.\r\n\r\nIn the short time that Mr. Arthur Jollyboy devoted to business, he\r\naccomplished as much as most men do in the course of a long day. There\r\nwas not a benevolent society in the town, of which Arthur Jollyboy,\r\nEsquire, of the Old Hulk (as he styled his cottage), was not a member,\r\ndirector, secretary, and treasurer, all in one, and all at once! If it\r\nhad been possible for man to be ubiquitous, Mr. Jollyboy would have been\r\nso naturally; or, if not naturally, he would have made himself so by\r\nforce of will. Yet he made no talk about it. His step was quiet, though\r\nquick; and his voice was gentle, though rapid; and he was chiefly famous\r\nfor _talking_ little and _doing_ much.\r\n\r\nSome time after the opening of our tale, Mr. Jollyboy had received\r\ninformation of Mrs. Grumbit's stocking movement. That same afternoon he\r\nput on his broad-brimmed white hat, and, walking out to the village in\r\nwhich she lived, called upon the vicar, who was a particular and intimate\r\nfriend of his. Having ascertained from the vicar that Mrs. Grumbit would\r\nnot accept of charity, he said abruptly,--\r\n\r\n\"And why not,--is she too proud?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied the vicar. \"She says that she would think shame to\r\ntake money from friends as long as she can work, because every penny that\r\nshe would thus get would be so much less to go to the helpless poor; of\r\nwhom, she says, with much truth, there are enough and to spare. And I\r\nquite agree with her as regards her principle; but it does not apply\r\nfully to her, for she cannot work so as to procure a sufficient\r\nlivelihood without injury to her health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she clever?\" inquired Mr. Jollyboy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, not particularly. In fact, she does not often exert her\r\nreasoning faculties, except in the common-place matters of ordinary and\r\nevery-day routine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she's cleverer than most people,\" said Mr. Jollyboy, shortly. \"Is\r\nshe obstinate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not in the least,\" returned the vicar with a puzzled smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, good-bye, good-bye; that's all I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jollyboy rose, and hurrying through the village, tapped at the\r\ncottage door, and was soon closeted with Mrs. Dorothy Grumbit. In the\r\ncourse of half an hour, Mr. Jollyboy drew from Mrs. Grumbit as much about\r\nher private affairs as he could, without appearing rude. But he found the\r\nold lady very close and sensitive on that point. Not so, however, when he\r\ngot her upon the subject of her nephew. She had enough, and more than\r\nenough, to say about him. It is true she began by remarking, sadly, that\r\nhe was a very bad boy; but, as she continued to talk about him, she\r\nsomehow or other gave her visitor the impression that he was a very\r\n_good_ boy! They had a wonderfully long and confidential talk about\r\nMartin, during which Mr. Jollyboy struck Mrs. Grumbit nearly dumb with\r\nhorror by stating positively what he would do for the boy,--he would send\r\nhim to sea! Then, seeing that he had hit the wrongest possible nail on\r\nthe head, he said that he would make the lad a clerk in his office, where\r\nhe would be sure to rise to a place of trust; whereat Mrs. Grumbit\r\ndanced, if we may so speak, into herself for joy.\r\n\r\n\"And now, ma'am, about these stockings. I want two thousand pairs as soon\r\nas I can get them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said Mrs. Grumbit.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, not for my own use, ma'am; nor for the use of my family, for\r\nI have no family; and if I had, that would be an unnecessarily large\r\nsupply. The fact is, Mrs. Grumbit, I am a merchant, and I send very large\r\nsupplies of home-made articles to foreign lands, and two thousand pairs\r\nof socks are a mere driblet. Of course I do not expect you to make them\r\nall for me, but I wish you to make as many pairs as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very happy--\" began Mrs. Grumbit.\r\n\r\n\"But, Mrs. Grumbit, there is a peculiar formation which I require in my\r\nsocks that will give you extra trouble, I fear; but I must have it,\r\nwhatever the additional expense may be. What is your charge for the pair\r\nyou are now making?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three shillings,\" said Mrs. Grumbit.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! very good. Now, take up the wires if you please, ma'am, and do what\r\nI tell you. Now, drop that stitch,--good; and take up this one,--capital;\r\nand pull this one across that way,--so; and that one across this\r\nway,--exactly. Now, what is the result?\"\r\n\r\nThe result was a complicated knot; and Mrs. Grumbit, after staring a few\r\nseconds at the old gentleman in surprise, said so, and begged to know\r\nwhat use it was of.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind, never mind. We merchants have strange fancies, and\r\nforeigners have curious tastes now and then. Please to make all my\r\nsocks with a hitch like that in them all round, just above the ankle.\r\nIt will form an ornamental ring. I'm sorry to put you to the trouble,\r\nbut of course I pay extra for fancy-work. Will six shillings a pair do\r\nfor these?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mrs. Grumbit, \"it is no additional--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, never mind,\" said Mr. Jollyboy. \"Two thousand pairs,\r\nremember, as soon as possible,--close knitted, plain stitch, rather\r\ncoarse worsted; and don't forget the hitch, Mrs. Grumbit, don't forget\r\nthe hitch.\"\r\n\r\nAh! reader, there are many Mrs. Grumbits in this world, requiring\r\n_hitches_ to be made in their stockings!\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door burst open. Mrs. Dorothy Grumbit uttered a\r\npiercing scream, Mr. Jollyboy dropped his spectacles and sat down on\r\nhis hat, and Martin Rattler stood before them with the white kitten\r\nin his arms.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds there was a dead silence, while an expression of\r\npuzzled disappointment passed over Mr. Jollyboy's ruddy countenance. At\r\nlast he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Is this, madam, the nephew who, you told me a little ago, is not\r\naddicted to fighting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the old lady faintly, and covering her eyes with her\r\nhands, \"that is Martin.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my aunt told you that, sir, she told you the truth,\" said Martin,\r\nsetting down the blood-stained white kitten, which forthwith began to\r\nstretch its limbs and lick itself dry. \"I don't ever fight if I can help\r\nit, but I couldn't help it to-day.\"\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of energy, and a revival of much of his former\r\nindignation, when he spoke of the kitten's sufferings, Martin recounted\r\nall the circumstances of the fight; during the recital of which Mrs.\r\nDorothy Grumbit took his hand in hers and patted it, gazing the while\r\ninto his swelled visage, and weeping plentifully, but very silently. When\r\nhe had finished, Mr. Jollyboy shook hands with him, and said he was a\r\ntrump, at the same time recommending him to go and wash his face. Then he\r\nwhispered a few words in Mrs. Grumbit's ear, which seemed to give that\r\nexcellent lady much pleasure; after which he endeavoured to straighten\r\nhis crushed hat; in which attempt he failed, took his leave, promised to\r\ncall again very soon, and went back to the Old Hulk--chuckling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMARTIN, BEING WILLING TO GO TO SEA, GOES TO SEA AGAINST HIS WILL\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years rolled away, casting chequered light and shadow over the\r\nlittle village of Ashford in their silent passage,--whitening the\r\nforelocks of the aged, and strengthening the muscles of the young. Death,\r\ntoo, touched a hearth here and there, and carried desolation to a home;\r\nfor four years cannot wing their flight without enforcing on us the\r\nlesson--which we are so often taught, and yet take so long to learn--that\r\nthis is not our rest,--that here we have no abiding city. Did we but\r\nponder this lesson more frequently and earnestly, instead of making us\r\nsad, it would nerve our hearts and hands to fight and work more\r\ndiligently,--to work in the cause of our Redeemer,--the only cause that\r\nis worth the life-long energy of immortal beings,--the great cause that\r\nincludes all others; and it would teach us to remember that our little\r\nday of opportunity will soon be spent, and that the night is at hand in\r\nwhich no man can work.\r\n\r\nFour years rolled away, and during this time Martin, having failed to\r\nobtain his aunt's consent to his going to sea, continued at school, doing\r\nhis best to curb the roving spirit that strove within him. Martin was not\r\nparticularly bright at the dead languages; to the rules of grammar he\r\nentertained a rooted aversion; and at history he was inclined to yawn,\r\nexcept when it happened to touch upon the names and deeds of such men as\r\nVasco di Gama and Columbus. But in geography he was perfect; and in\r\narithmetic and book-keeping he was quite a proficient, to the delight of\r\nMrs. Dorothy Grumbit, whose household books he summed up; and to the\r\nsatisfaction of his fast friend, Mr. Arthur Jollyboy, whose ledgers he\r\nwas--in that old gentleman's secret resolves--destined to keep.\r\n\r\nMartin was now fourteen, broad and strong, and tall for his age. He was\r\nthe idol of the school,--dashing, daring, reckless, and good-natured.\r\nThere was almost nothing that he would not attempt, and there were very\r\nfew things that he could not do. He never fought, however--from\r\nprinciple; and his strength and size often saved him from the necessity.\r\nBut he often prevented other boys from fighting, except when he thought\r\nthere was good reason for it; then he stood by and saw fair play. There\r\nwas a strange mixture of philosophical gravity, too, in Martin. As he\r\ngrew older he became more enthusiastic and less boisterous.\r\n\r\nBob Croaker was still at the school, and was, from prudential motives, a\r\nfast friend of Martin. But he bore him a secret grudge, for he could not\r\nforget the great fight.\r\n\r\nOne day Bob took Martin by the arm, and said, \"I say, Rattler, come with\r\nme to Bilton, and have some fun among the shipping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't mind if I do,\" said Martin. \"I'm just in the mood for a\r\nramble, and I'm not expected home till bed-time.\"\r\n\r\nIn little more than an hour the two boys were wandering about the\r\ndock-yards of the sea-port town, and deeply engaged in examining the\r\ncomplicated rigging of the ships. While thus occupied, the clanking of a\r\nwindlass and the merry \"Yo heave O! and away she goes,\" of the sailors,\r\nattracted their attention.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! there goes the _Firefly_, bound for the South Seas,\" cried Bob\r\nCroaker; \"come, let's see her start. I say, Martin, isn't your friend,\r\nBarney O'Flannagan, on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is. He tries to get me to go out every voyage, and I wish I\r\ncould. Come quickly; I want to say good-bye to him before he starts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you run away, Rattler?\" inquired Bob, as they hurried round\r\nthe docks to where the vessel was warping out.\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't need to. My aunt has given me leave to go if I like; but\r\nshe says it would break her heart if I do; and I would rather be screwed\r\ndown to a desk for ever than do that, Bob Croaker.\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel, upon the deck of which the two boys now leaped, was a large,\r\nheavy-built barque. Her sails were hanging loose, and the captain was\r\ngiving orders to the men, who had their attention divided between their\r\nduties on board and their mothers, wives, and sisters, who still lingered\r\nto take a last farewell.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, those who don't want to go to sea had better go ashore,\"\r\nroared the captain.\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate rush to the side.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Martin,\" whispered Barney, as he hurried past, \"jump down below\r\nfor'ard; you can go out o' the harbour mouth with us and get ashore in\r\none o' the shore-boats alongside. They'll not cast off till we're well\r\nout. I want to speak to you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Man the fore top-sail halyards,\" shouted the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"Ay ay, sir-r-r,\" and the men sprang to obey. Just then the ship\r\ntouched on the bar at the mouth of the harbour, and in another moment\r\nshe was aground.\r\n\r\n\"There, now, she's hard and fast!\" roared the captain, as he stormed\r\nabout the deck in a paroxysm of rage. But man's rage could avail nothing.\r\nThey had missed the passage by a few feet, and now they had to wait the\r\nfall and rise again of the tide ere they could hope to get off.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion that followed, Bob Croaker suggested that Martin and he\r\nshould take one of the punts, or small boats which hovered round the\r\nvessel, and put out to sea, where they might spend the day pleasantly in\r\nrowing and fishing.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" exclaimed Martin. \"Let's go at once. Yonder's a little fellow\r\nwho will let us have his punt for a few pence. I know him. Hallo, Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" squeaked a boy who was so small that he could scarcely lift the\r\noar, light though it was, with which he sculled his punt cleverly along.\r\n\r\n\"Shove alongside, like a good fellow; we want your boat for a little to\r\nrow out a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a-blowin' too hard,\" squeaked the small boy, as he ranged\r\nalongside. \"I'm afeared you'll be blowed out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Bob Croaker, grasping the rope which the boy threw to\r\nhim. \"Jump on board, younker; we don't want you to help us, and you're\r\ntoo heavy for ballast. Slip down the side, Martin, and get in while I\r\nhold on to the rope. All right? now I'll follow. Here, shrimp, hold the\r\nrope till I'm in, and then cast off. Look alive!\"\r\n\r\nAs Bob spoke, he handed the rope to the little boy; but, in doing so, let\r\nit accidentally slip out of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Catch hold o' the main chains, Martin,--quick!\"\r\n\r\nBut Martin was too late. The current that swept out of the harbour\r\nwhirled the light punt away from the ship's side, and carried it out\r\nseaward. Martin instantly sprang to the oar, and turned the boat's head\r\nround. He was a stout and expert rower, and would soon have regained the\r\nship; but the wind increased at the moment, and blew in a squall off\r\nshore, which carried him further out despite his utmost efforts. Seeing\r\nthat all further attempts were useless, Martin stood up and waved his\r\nhand to Bob Croaker, shouting as he did so, \"Never mind, Bob, I'll make\r\nfor the South Point. Run round and meet me, and we'll row back together.\"\r\n\r\nThe South Point was a low cape of land which stretched a considerable\r\ndistance out to sea, about three miles to the southward of Bilton\r\nharbour. It formed a large bay, across which, in ordinary weather, a\r\nsmall boat might be rowed in safety. Martin Rattler was well known at the\r\nsea-port as a strong and fearless boy, so that no apprehension was\r\nentertained for his safety by those who saw him blown away. Bob Croaker\r\nimmediately started for the Point on foot, a distance of about four miles\r\nby land; and the crew of the _Firefly_ were so busied with their stranded\r\nvessel that they took no notice of the doings of the boys.\r\n\r\nBut the weather now became more and more stormy. Thick clouds gathered on\r\nthe horizon. The wind began to blow with steady violence, and shifted a\r\ncouple of points to the southward; so that Martin found it impossible to\r\nkeep straight for the Point. Still he worked perseveringly at his single\r\noar, and sculled rapidly over the sea; but, as he approached the Point,\r\nhe soon perceived that no effort of which he was capable could enable him\r\nto gain it. But Martin's heart was stout. He strove with all the energy\r\nof hope, until the Point was passed; and then, turning the head of his\r\nlittle boat towards it, he strove with all the energy of despair, until\r\nhe fell down exhausted. The wind and tide swept him rapidly out to sea;\r\nand when his terrified comrade reached the Point, the little boat was but\r\na speck on the seaward horizon.\r\n\r\nWell was it then for Martin Rattler that a friendly heart beat for him on\r\nboard the _Firefly_, Bob Croaker carried the news to the town; but no one\r\nwas found daring enough to risk his life out in a boat on that stormy\r\nevening. The little punt had been long out of sight ere the news reached\r\nthem, and the wind had increased to a gale. But Barney O'Flannagan\r\nquestioned Bob Croaker closely, and took particular note of the point of\r\nthe compass at which Martin had disappeared; and when the _Firefly_ at\r\nlength got under weigh, he climbed to the fore-top cross-trees, and stood\r\nthere scanning the horizon with an anxious eye.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark, and a feeling of despair began to creep over\r\nthe seaman's heart as he gazed round the wide expanse of water, on\r\nwhich nothing was to be seen except the white foam that crested the\r\nrising billows.\r\n\r\n\"Starboard, hard!\" he shouted suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Starboard it is!\" replied the man at the wheel, with prompt obedience.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Barney slid down the back-stay and stood on the deck,\r\nwhile the ship rounded to and narrowly missed striking a small boat that\r\nfloated keel up on the water. There was no cry from the boat; and it\r\nmight have been passed as a mere wreck, had not the lynx eye of Barney\r\nnoticed a dark object clinging to it.\r\n\r\n\"Lower away a boat, lads,\" cried the Irishman, springing overboard;\r\nand the words had scarcely passed his lips when the water closed\r\nover his head.\r\n\r\nThe _Firefly_ was hove to, a boat was lowered and rowed towards Barney,\r\nwhose strong voice guided his shipmates towards him. In less than a\r\nquarter of an hour the bold sailor and his young friend Martin Rattler\r\nwere safe on board, and the ship's head was again turned out to sea.\r\n\r\nIt was full half an hour before Martin was restored to consciousness in\r\nthe forecastle, to which his deliverer had conveyed him.\r\n\r\n\"Musha, lad, but ye're booked for the blue wather now, an' no mistake!\"\r\nsaid Barney, looking with an expression of deep sympathy at the poor boy,\r\nwho sat staring before him quite speechless. \"The capting'll not let ye\r\nout o' this ship till ye git to the gould coast, or some sich place. He\r\ncouldn't turn back av he wanted iver so much; but he doesn't want to, for\r\nhe needs a smart lad like you, an' he'll keep you now, for sartin.\"\r\n\r\nBarney sat down by Martin's side and stroked his fair curls, as he sought\r\nin his own quaint fashion to console him. But in vain. Martin grew quite\r\ndesperate as he thought of the misery into which poor Aunt Dorothy\r\nGrumbit would be plunged, on learning that he had been swept out to sea\r\nin a little boat, and drowned, as she would naturally suppose. In his\r\nfrenzy he entreated and implored the captain to send him back in the\r\nboat, and even threatened to knock out his brains with a handspike if he\r\ndid not; but the captain smiled and told him that it was his own fault.\r\nHe had no business to be putting to sea in a small boat in rough weather,\r\nand he might be thankful he wasn't drowned. He wouldn't turn back now for\r\nfifty pounds twice told.\r\n\r\nAt length Martin became convinced that all hope of returning home was\r\ngone. He went quietly below, threw himself into one of the sailor's\r\nberths, turned his face to the wall, and wept long and bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE, A PIRATE, CHASE, WRECK, AND ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nTime reconciles a man to almost anything. In the course of time Martin\r\nRattler became reconciled to his fate, and went about the ordinary duties\r\nof a cabin-boy on board the _Firefly_ just as if he had been appointed to\r\nthat office in the ordinary way,--with the consent of the owners and by\r\nthe advice of his friends. The captain, Skinflint by name, and as surly\r\nan old fellow as ever walked a quarter-deck, agreed to pay him wages \"if\r\nhe behaved well.\" The steward, under whose immediate authority he was\r\nplaced, turned out to be a hearty, good-natured young fellow, and was\r\nvery kind to him. But Martin's great friend was Barney O'Flannagan, the\r\ncook, with whom he spent many an hour in the night watches, talking over\r\nplans, and prospects, and retrospects, and foreign lands.\r\n\r\nAs Martin had no clothes except those on his back, which fortunately\r\nhappened to be new and good, Barney gave him a couple of blue striped\r\nshirts, and made him a jacket, pantaloons, and slippers of canvas; and,\r\nwhat was of much greater importance, taught him how to make and mend the\r\nsame for himself.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see, Martin, lad,\" he said, while thus employed one day, many weeks\r\nafter leaving port, \"it's a great thing, intirely, to be able to help\r\nyerself. For my part, I niver travel without my work-box in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your work-box!\" said Martin, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Jist so. An' it consists of wan sail-maker's needle, a ball o' twine,\r\nand a clasp-knife. Set me down with these before a roll o' canvas and\r\nI'll make you a'most anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have a turn for everything, Barney,\" said Martin. \"How came\r\nyou to be a cook?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's more nor I can tell ye, lad. As far as I remimber, I began with\r\nmurphies, when I was two feet high, in my father's cabin in ould Ireland.\r\nBut that was on my own account intirely, and not as a purfession; and a\r\nsorrowful time I had of it, too, for I was for iver burnin' my fingers\r\npromiskiously, and fallin' into the fire ivery day more or less--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to hoist top-gallant-sails,\" shouted the captain. \"How's\r\nher head?\"\r\n\r\n\"South and by east, sir,\" answered the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Keep her away two points. Look alive lads. Hand me the glass, Martin.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship was close hauled when these abrupt orders were given, battling\r\nin the teeth of a stiff breeze, off the coast of South America. About\r\nthis time, several piratical vessels had succeeded in cutting off a\r\nnumber of merchantmen near the coast of Brazil. They had not only taken\r\nthe valuable parts of their cargoes, but had murdered the crews under\r\ncircumstances of great cruelty; and ships trading to these regions were,\r\nconsequently, exceedingly careful to avoid all suspicious craft as much\r\nas possible. It was, therefore, with some anxiety that the men watched\r\nthe captain's face as he examined the strange sail through the telescope.\r\n\r\n\"A Spanish schooner,\" muttered the captain, as he shut up the glass with\r\na bang. \"I won't trust her. Up with the royals and rig out stun'-sails,\r\nMr. Wilson, (to the mate). Let her fall away, keep her head nor'-west,\r\nd'ye hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let go the lee braces and square the yards. Look sharp, now, lads. If\r\nthat blackguard gets hold of us ye'll have to walk the plank, every\r\nman of ye.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the ship's course was completely altered; a cloud of\r\ncanvas spread out from the yards, and the _Firefly_ bounded on her course\r\nlike a fresh race-horse. But it soon became evident that the heavy barque\r\nwas no match for the schooner, which crowded sail and bore down at a rate\r\nthat bade fair to overhaul them in a few hours. The chase continued till\r\nevening, when suddenly the look-out at the mast-head shouted, \"Land, ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Right ahead,\" sang out the man.\r\n\r\n\"I'll run her ashore sooner than be taken,\" muttered the captain, with an\r\nangry scowl at the schooner, which was now almost within range on the\r\nweather quarter, with the dreaded black flag flying at her peak. In a few\r\nminutes breakers were descried ahead.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye see anything like a passage?\" shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; two points on the weather bow.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a white cloud burst from the schooner's bow, and a shot,\r\nevidently from a heavy gun, came ricochetting over the sea. It was well\r\naimed, for it cut right through the barque's main-mast, just below the\r\nyard, and brought the main-top-mast, with all the yards, sails, and\r\ngearing above it, down upon the deck. The weight of the wreck, also,\r\ncarried away the fore-top-mast, and, in a single instant, the _Firefly_\r\nwas completely disabled.\r\n\r\n\"Lower away the boats,\" cried the captain; \"look alive, now; we'll give\r\nthem the slip yet. It'll be dark in two minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was right. In tropical regions there is little or no\r\ntwilight. Night succeeds day almost instantaneously. Before the boats\r\nwere lowered and the men embarked it was becoming quite dark. The\r\nschooner observed the movement, however, and, as she did not dare to\r\nventure through the reef in the dark, her boats were also lowered and the\r\nchase was recommenced.\r\n\r\nThe reef was passed in safety, and now a hard struggle took place, for\r\nthe shore was still far distant. As it chanced to be cloudy weather the\r\ndarkness became intense, and progress could only be guessed at by the\r\nsound of the oars; but these soon told too plainly that the boats of the\r\nschooner were overtaking those of the barque.\r\n\r\n\"Pull with a will, lads,\" cried the captain; \"we can't be more than half\r\na mile from shore; give way, my hearties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, captain, we can fight them, we've most of us got pistols and\r\ncutlasses,\" said one of the men in a sulky tone.\r\n\r\n\"Fight them!\" cried the captain, \"they're four times our number, and\r\nevery man armed to the teeth. If ye don't fancy walking the plank or\r\ndancing on nothing at the yard-arm, ye'd better pull away and hold\r\nyour jaw.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they could just see the schooner's boats in the dim light,\r\nabout half-musket range astern.\r\n\r\n\"Back you' oars,\" shouted a stern voice in broken English, \"or I blow you\r\nout de watter in one oder moment,--black-yards!\"\r\n\r\nThis order was enforced by a musket shot, which whizzed over the boat\r\nwithin an inch of the captain's head. The men ceased rowing and the boats\r\nof the pirate ranged close up.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Martin,\" whispered Barney O'Flannagan, who sat at the bow oar,\r\n\"I'm goin' to swim ashore; jist you slip arter me as quiet as ye can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sharks!\" suggested Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to them,\" said Barney as he slipped over the side, \"they're\r\nwelcome to me. Til take my chance. They'll find me mortial tough, anyhow.\r\nCome along, lad, look sharp!\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation Martin slid over the gunwale into the sea,\r\nand, just as the pirate boats grappled with those of the barque, he and\r\nBarney found themselves gliding as silently as otters towards the shore.\r\nSo quietly had the manoeuvre been accomplished, that the men in their own\r\nboat were ignorant of their absence. In a few minutes they were beyond\r\nthe chance of detection.\r\n\r\n\"Keep close to me, lad,\" whispered the Irishman. \"If we separate in the\r\ndarkness we'll niver forgather again. Catch hould o; my shoulder if ye\r\nget blowed, and splutter as much as ye like. They can't hear us now, and\r\nit'll help to frighten the sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Martin; \"I can swim like a cork in such warm water\r\nas this. Just go a little slower and I'll do famously.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraging each other, and keeping close together, lest they should\r\nget separated in the thick darkness of the night, the two friends struck\r\nout bravely for the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMARTIN AND BARNEY GET LOST IN A GREAT FOREST, WHERE THEY SEE STRANGE AND\r\nTERRIBLE THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn gaining the beach, the first thing that Barney did, after shaking\r\nhimself like a huge Newfoundland dog, was to ascertain that his pistol\r\nand cutlass were safe; for, although the former could be of no use in its\r\npresent condition, still, as he sagaciously remarked, \"it was a good\r\nthing to have, for they might chance to git powder wan day or other, and\r\nthe flint would make fire, anyhow.\" Fortunately the weather was extremely\r\nwarm; so they were enabled to take off and wring their clothes without\r\nmuch inconvenience, except that in a short time a few adventurous\r\nmosquitoes--probably sea-faring ones--came down out of the woods and\r\nattacked their bare bodies so vigorously that they were fain to hurry on\r\ntheir clothes again before they were quite dry.\r\n\r\nThe clouds began to clear away soon after they landed, and the brilliant\r\nlight of the southern constellations revealed to them dimly the\r\nappearance of the coast. It was a low sandy beach skirting the sea and\r\nextending back for about a quarter of a mile in the form of a grassy\r\nplain, dotted here and there with scrubby underwood. Beyond this was a\r\ndark line of forest. The light was not sufficient to enable them to\r\nascertain the appearance of the interior. Barney and Martin now cast\r\nabout in their minds how they were to spend the night.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see,\" said the Irishman, \"it's of no use goin' to look for houses,\r\nbecause there's maybe none at all on this coast; an' there's no sayin'\r\nbut we may fall in with savages--for them parts swarms with them; so we'd\r\nbetter go into the woods an'--\"\r\n\r\nBarney was interrupted here by a low howl, which proceeded from the woods\r\nreferred to, and was most unlike any cry they had ever heard before.\r\n\r\n\"Och, but I'll think better of it. P'raps it'll be as well _not_ to go\r\ninto the woods, but to camp where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so too,\" said Martin, searching about for small twigs and\r\ndrift-wood with which to make a fire. \"There is no saying what sort of\r\nwild beasts may be in the forest, so we had better wait till daylight.\"\r\n\r\nA fire was quickly lighted by means of the pistol-flint and a little dry\r\ngrass, which, when well bruised and put into the pan, caught a spark\r\nafter one or two attempts, and was soon blown into a flame. But no wood\r\nlarge enough to keep the fire burning for any length of time could be\r\nfound; so Barney said he would go up to the forest and fetch some. \"I'll\r\nlave my shoes and socks, Martin, to dry at the fire. See ye don't let\r\nthem burn.\"\r\n\r\nTraversing the meadow with hasty strides, the bold sailor quickly reached\r\nthe edge of the forest, where he began to lop off several dead branches\r\nfrom the trees with his cutlass. While thus engaged the howl which had\r\nformerly startled him was repeated. \"Av I only knowed what ye was,\"\r\nmuttered Barney in a serious tone, \"it would be some sort o' comfort.\"\r\n\r\nA loud cry of a different kind here interrupted his soliloquy, and soon\r\nafter the first cry was repeated louder than before.\r\n\r\nClenching his teeth and knitting his brows the perplexed Irishman resumed\r\nhis work with a desperate resolve not to be again interrupted. But he had\r\nmiscalculated the strength of his nerves. Albeit as brave a man as ever\r\nstepped, when his enemy was before him, Barney was, nevertheless,\r\nstrongly imbued with superstitious feelings; and the conflict between his\r\nphysical courage and his mental cowardice produced a species of wild\r\nexasperation, which, he often asserted, was very hard to bear. Scarcely\r\nhad he resumed his work when a bat of enormous size brushed past his nose\r\nso noiselessly that it seemed more like a phantom than a reality. Barney\r\nhad never seen anything of the sort before, and a cold perspiration broke\r\nout upon him, when he fancied it might be a ghost. Again the bat swept\r\npast close to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Musha, but I'll kill ye, ghost or no ghost,\" he ejaculated, gazing all\r\nround into the gloomy depths of the woods with his cutlass uplifted.\r\nInstead of flying again in front of him, as he had expected, the bat flew\r\nwith a whirring noise past his ear. Down came the cutlass with a sudden\r\nthwack, cutting deep into the trunk of a small tree, which trembled under\r\nthe shock and sent a shower of ripe nuts of a large size down upon the\r\nsailor's head. Startled as he was, he sprang backward with a wild cry;\r\nthen, half ashamed of his groundless fears, he collected the wood he had\r\ncut, threw it hastily on his shoulder and went with a quick step out of\r\nthe woods. In doing so he put his foot upon the head of a small snake,\r\nwhich wriggled up round his ankle and leg. If there was anything on earth\r\nthat Barney abhorred and dreaded it was a snake. No sooner did he feel\r\nits cold form writhing under his foot, than he uttered a tremendous yell\r\nof terror, dropped his bundle of sticks, and fled precipitately to the\r\nbeach, where he did not hall till he found himself knee-deep in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Och, Martin, boy,\" gasped the affrighted sailor, \"it's my belafe that\r\nall the evil spirits on arth live in yonder wood; indeed I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Barney,\" said Martin, laughing; \"there are no such things as\r\nghosts; at any rate I'm resolved to face them, for if we don't get some\r\nsticks the fire will go out and leave us very comfortless. Come, I'll go\r\nup with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on yer shoes then, avic, for the sarpints are no ghosts, anyhow, and\r\nI'm tould they're pisonous sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon found the bundle of dry sticks that Barney had thrown down, and\r\nreturning with it to the beach, they speedily kindled a roaring fire,\r\nwhich made them feel quite cheerful. True, they had nothing to eat; but\r\nhaving had a good dinner on board the barque late that afternoon, they\r\nwere not much in want of food. While they sat thus on the sand of the\r\nsea-shore, spreading their hands before the blaze and talking over their\r\nstrange position, a low rumbling of distant thunder was heard. Barney's\r\ncountenance instantly fell.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Barney?\" inquired Martin, as he observed his\r\ncompanion gaze anxiously up at the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Och, it's comin', sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what though it does come?\" returned Martin; \"we can creep under one\r\nof these thick bushes till the shower is past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did ye iver see a thunder-storm in the tropics?\" inquired Barney.\r\n\r\n\"No, never,\" replied Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Then if ye don't want to feel and see it both at wance, come with me as\r\nquick as iver ye can.\"\r\n\r\nBarney started up as he spoke, stuck his cutlass and pistol into his\r\nbelt, and set off towards the woods at a sharp run, followed closely by\r\nhis wondering companion.\r\n\r\nTheir haste was by no means unnecessary. Great black clouds rushed up\r\ntowards the zenith from all points of the compass, and, just as they\r\nreached the woods, darkness so thick that it might almost be felt\r\noverspread the scene. Then there was a flash of lightning so vivid that\r\nit seemed as if a bright day had been created and extinguished in a\r\nmoment, leaving the darkness ten times more oppressive. It was followed\r\ninstantaneously by a crash and a prolonged rattle, that sounded as if a\r\nuniverse of solid worlds were rushing into contact overhead and bursting\r\ninto atoms. The flash was so far useful to the fugitives, that it enabled\r\nthem to observe a many-stemmed tree with dense and heavy foliage, under\r\nwhich they darted. They were just in time, and had scarcely seated\r\nthemselves among its branches when the rain came down in a way not only\r\nthat Martin had never seen, but that he had never conceived of before. It\r\nfell, as it were, in broad heavy sheets, and its sound was a loud,\r\ncontinuous roar.\r\n\r\nThe wind soon after burst upon the forest and added to the hideous shriek\r\nof elements. The trees bent before it; the rain was whirled and dashed\r\nabout in water-spouts; and huge limbs were rent from some of the larger\r\ntrees with a crash like thunder, and swept far away into the forest. The\r\nvery earth trembled and seemed terrified at the dreadful conflict going\r\non above. It seemed to the two friends as if the end of the world were\r\ncome; and they could do nothing but cower among the branches of the tree\r\nand watch the storm in silence; while they felt, in a way they had never\r\nbefore experienced, how utterly helpless they were and unable to foresee\r\nor avert the many dangers by which they were surrounded, and how\r\nabsolutely dependent they were on God for protection.\r\n\r\nFor several hours the storm continued. Then it ceased as suddenly as it\r\nhad begun, and the bright stars again shone down upon a peaceful scene.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, Martin and his comrade descended the tree and\r\nendeavoured to find their way back to the beach. But this was no easy\r\nmatter. The haste with which they had run into the woods, and the\r\nconfusion of the storm, had made them uncertain in which direction it\r\nlay; and the more they tried to get out, the deeper they penetrated into\r\nthe forest. At length, wearied with fruitless wandering and stumbling\r\nabout in the dark, they resolved to spend the night where they were.\r\nComing to a place which was more open than usual, and where they could\r\nsee a portion of the starry sky overhead, they sat down on a dry spot\r\nunder the shelter of a spreading tree, and, leaning their backs against\r\nthe trunk, very soon fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAN ENCHANTING LAND--AN UNCOMFORTABLE BED AND A QUEER BREAKFAST--MANY\r\nSURPRISES AND A FEW FRIGHTS, TOGETHER WITH A NOTABLE DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I've woked in paradise!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the exclamation that aroused Martin Rattler on the morning after\r\nhis landing on the coast of South America. It was uttered by Barney\r\nO'Flannagan, who lay at full length on his back, his head propped up by a\r\nroot of the tree under which they had slept, and his eyes staring right\r\nbefore him with an expression of concentrated amazement. When Martin\r\nopened his eyes, he too was struck dumb with surprise. And well might\r\nthey gaze with astonishment; for the last ray of departing daylight on\r\nthe night before had flickered over the open sea, and now the first gleam\r\nof returning sunshine revealed to them the magnificent forests of Brazil.\r\n\r\nYes, well might they gaze and gaze again in boundless admiration; for\r\nthe tropical sun shone down on a scene of dazzling and luxuriant\r\nvegetation, so resplendent that it seemed to them the realization of a\r\nfairy tale. Plants and shrubs and flowers were there, of the most\r\ncurious and brilliant description, and of which they neither knew the\r\nuses nor the names. Majestic trees were there, with foliage of every\r\nshape and size and hue; some with stems twenty feet in circumference;\r\nothers more slender in form, straight and tall; and some twisted in a\r\nbunch together and rising upwards like fluted pillars: a few had\r\nbuttresses, or natural planks, several feet broad, ranged all round\r\ntheir trunks, as if to support them; while many bent gracefully beneath\r\nthe load of their clustering fruit and heavy foliage. Orange-trees with\r\ntheir ripe fruit shone in the sunbeams like gold. Stately palms rose\r\nabove the surrounding trees and waved their feathery plumes in the air,\r\nand bananas with broad enormous leaves rustled in the breeze and cast a\r\ncool shadow on the ground.\r\n\r\nWell might they gaze in great surprise; for all these curious and\r\nbeautiful trees were surrounded by and entwined in the embrace of\r\nluxuriant and remarkable climbing plants. The parasitic vanilla with its\r\nstar-like blossoms crept up their trunks and along their branches, where\r\nit hung in graceful festoons, or drooped back again almost to the ground.\r\nSo rich and numerous were these creepers, that in many cases they killed\r\nthe strong giants whom they embraced so lovingly. Some of them hung from\r\nthe tree-tops like stays from the masts of a ship, and many of them\r\nmingled their brilliant flowers so closely with the leaves, that the\r\nclimbing-plants and their supporters could not be distinguished from each\r\nother, and it seemed as though the trees themselves had become gigantic\r\nflowering shrubs.\r\n\r\nBirds, too, were there in myriads,--and such birds! Their feathers were\r\ngreen and gold and scarlet and yellow and blue--fresh and bright and\r\nbrilliant as the sky beneath which they were nurtured. The great toucan,\r\nwith a beak nearly as big as his body, flew clumsily from stem to stem.\r\nThe tiny, delicate humming-birds, scarce larger than bees, fluttered from\r\nflower to flower and spray to spray, like points of brilliant green. But\r\nthey were irritable, passionate little creatures, these lovely things,\r\nand quarrelled with each other and fought like very wasps! Enormous\r\nbutterflies, with wings of deep metallic blue, shot past or hovered in\r\nthe air like gleams of light; and green paroquets swooped from tree to\r\ntree and chattered joyfully over their morning meal.\r\n\r\nWell might they gaze with wonder, and smile too with extreme merriment,\r\nfor monkeys stared at them from between the leaves with expressions of\r\nundisguised amazement, and bounded away shrieking and chattering in\r\nconsternation, swinging from branch to branch with incredible speed, and\r\nnot scrupling to use each other's tails to swing by when occasion\r\noffered. Some were big and red and ugly,--as ugly as you can possibly\r\nimagine, with blue faces and fiercely grinning teeth; others were\r\ndelicately formed and sad of countenance, as if they were for ever\r\nbewailing the loss of near and dear relations, and could by no means come\r\nat consolation; and some were small and pretty, with faces no bigger than\r\na halfpenny. As a general rule, it seemed to Barney, the smaller the\r\nmonkey the longer the tail.\r\n\r\nYes, well might they gaze and gaze again in surprise and in excessive\r\nadmiration; and well might Barney O'Flannagan--under the circumstances,\r\nwith such sights and sounds around him, and the delightful odours of\r\nmyrtle trees arid orange blossoms and the Cape jessamine stealing up his\r\nnostrils--deem himself the tenant of another world, and evince his\r\nconviction of the fact in that memorable expression--\"I've woked in\r\nparadise!\"\r\n\r\nBut Barney began to find \"paradise\" not quite so comfortable as it ought\r\nto be; for when he tried to get up he found his bones pained and stiff\r\nfrom sleeping in damp clothes; and moreover, his face was very much\r\nswelled, owing to the myriads of mosquitoes which had supped of it during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, then, _won't_ ye be done!\" he cried, angrily, giving his face a\r\nslap that killed at least two or three hundred of his tormentors. But\r\nthousands more attacked him instantly, and he soon found out,--what every\r\none finds out sooner or later in hot climates,--that _patience_ is one of\r\nthe best remedies for mosquito bites. He also discovered shortly\r\nafterwards that smoke is not a bad remedy, in connection with patience.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to have for breakfast, Barney?\" inquired Martin as he rose\r\nand yawned and stretched his limbs.\r\n\r\n\"Help yersilf to what ye plase,\" said Barney, with a polite bow, waving\r\nhis hand round him, as if the forest were his private property and Martin\r\nRattler his honoured guest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I vote for oranges,\" said Martin, going towards a tree which was\r\nladen with ripe fruit.\r\n\r\n\"An' I'll try plums, by way of variety,\" added his companion.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes several kinds of fruit and nuts were gathered and\r\nspread at the foot of the tree under which they had reposed. Then\r\nBarney proceeded to kindle a fire,--not that he had anything to cook,\r\nbut he said it looked sociable-like, and the smoke would keep off the\r\nflies. The operation, however, was by no means easy. Everything had\r\nbeen soaked by the rain of the previous night, and a bit of dry grass\r\ncould scarcely be found. At length he procured a little; and by rubbing\r\nit in the damp gunpowder which he had extracted from his pistol, and\r\ndrying it in the sun, he formed a sort of tinder that caught fire after\r\nmuch persevering effort.\r\n\r\nSome of the fruits they found to be good,--others bad. The good they\r\nate,--the bad they threw away. After their frugal fare they felt much\r\nrefreshed, and then began to talk of what they should do.\r\n\r\n\"We can't live here with parrots and monkeys, you know,\" said Martin; \"we\r\nmust try to find a village or town of some sort; or get to the coast, and\r\nthen we shall perhaps meet with a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, lad,\" replied Barney, knitting his brows and looking extremely\r\nsagacious; \"the fact is, since neither of us knows nothing about\r\nanything, or the way to any place, my advice is to walk straight for'ard\r\ntill we come to something.\"\r\n\r\n\"So think I,\" replied Martin; \"therefore the sooner we set off the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nHaving no luggage to pack and no arrangements of any kind to make, the\r\ntwo friends rose from their primitive breakfast-table, and walked away\r\nstraight before them into the forest.\r\n\r\nAll that day they travelled patiently forward, conversing pleasantly\r\nabout the various and wonderful trees, and flowers, and animals they met\r\nwith by the way; but no signs were discovered that indicated the presence\r\nof man. Towards evening, however, they fell upon a track or\r\nfoot-path,--which discovery rejoiced them much; and here, before\r\nproceeding further, they sat down to eat a little more fruit,--which,\r\nindeed, they had done several times during the day. They walked nearly\r\nthirty miles that day without seeing a human being; but they met with\r\nmany strange and beautiful birds and beasts,--some of which were of so\r\nfierce an aspect that they would have been very glad to have had guns to\r\ndefend themselves with. Fortunately, however, all the animals seemed to\r\nbe much more afraid of them than they were of the animals; so they\r\ntravelled in safety. Several times during the course of the day they saw\r\nsnakes and serpents, which glided away into the jungle on their approach,\r\nand could not be overtaken, although Barney made repeated darts at them,\r\nintending to attack them with his cutlass; which assaults always proved\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\nOnce they were charged by a herd of peccaries,--a species of pig or wild\r\nhog,--from which they escaped by jumping actively to one side; but the\r\npeccaries turned and rushed at them again, and it was only by springing\r\nup the branches of a neighbouring tree that they escaped their fury.\r\nThese peccaries are the fiercest and most dauntless animals in the\r\nforests of Brazil. They do not know what fear is,--they will rush in the\r\nface of anything; and, unlike all other animals, are quite indifferent to\r\nthe report of fire-arms. Their bodies are covered with long bristles,\r\nresembling very much the quills of the porcupine.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew on, the birds and beasts and the innumerable insects,\r\nthat had kept up a perpetual noise during the day, retired to rest; and\r\nthen the nocturnal animals began to creep out of their holes and go\r\nabout. Huge vampire-bats, one of which had given Barney such a fright the\r\nnight before, flew silently past them; and the wild howlings commenced\r\nagain. They now discovered that one of the most dismal of the howls\r\nproceeded from a species of monkey: at which discovery Martin laughed\r\nvery much, and rallied his companion on being so easily frightened; but\r\nBarney gladly joined in the laugh against himself, for, to say truth, he\r\nfelt quite relieved and light-hearted at discovering that his ghosts were\r\nconverted into bats and monkeys!\r\n\r\nThere was one roar, however, which, when they heard it ever and anon,\r\ngave them considerable uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye think there's lions in them parts?\" inquired Barney, glancing with\r\nan expression of regret at his empty pistol, and laying his hand on the\r\nhilt of his cutlass.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Martin, in a low tone of voice. \"I have read in\r\nmy school geography that there are tigers of some sort,--jaguars, or\r\nounces, I think they are called,--but there are no--\"\r\n\r\nMartin's speech was cut short by a terrific roar, which rang through the\r\nwoods, and the next instant a magnificent jaguar, or South American\r\ntiger, bounded on to the track a few yards in advance, and, wheeling\r\nround, glared fiercely at the travellers. It seemed, in the uncertain\r\nlight, as if his eyes were two balls of living fire. Though not so large\r\nas the royal Bengal tiger of India, this animal was nevertheless of\r\nimmense size, and had a very ferocious aspect. His roar was so sudden and\r\nawful, and his appearance so unexpected, that the blood was sent\r\nthrilling back into the hearts of the travellers, who stood rooted to the\r\nspot, absolutely unable to move. This was the first large animal of the\r\ncat kind that either of them had seen in all the terrible majesty of its\r\nwild condition; and, for the first time, Martin and his friend felt that\r\nawful sensation of dread that will assail even the bravest heart when a\r\nnew species of imminent danger is suddenly presented. It is said that no\r\nanimal can withstand the steady gaze of a human eye; and many travellers\r\nin wild countries have proved this to be a fact. On the present occasion\r\nour adventurers stared long and steadily at the wild creature before\r\nthem, from a mingled feeling of surprise and horror. In a few seconds the\r\njaguar showed signs of being disconcerted. It turned its head from side\r\nto side slightly, and dropped its eyes, as if to avoid their gaze. Then\r\nturning slowly and stealthily round, it sprang with a magnificent bound\r\ninto the jungle, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nBoth Martin and Barney heaved a deep sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"What a mercy it did not attack us!\" said the former, wiping the cold\r\nperspiration from his forehead. \"We should have had no chance against\r\nsuch a terrible beast with a cutlass, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, boy, true,\" replied his friend, gravely; \"it would have been\r\nlittle better than a penknife in the ribs o' sich a cratur. I niver\r\nthought that it was in the power o' man or baste to put me in sich a\r\nfright; but the longer we live we learn, boy.\"\r\n\r\nBarney's disposition to make light of everything was thoroughly subdued\r\nby this incident, and he felt none of his usual inclination to regard all\r\nthat he saw in the Brazilian forests with a comical eye. The danger they\r\nhad escaped was too real and terrible, and their almost unarmed condition\r\ntoo serious, to be lightly esteemed. For the next hour or two he\r\ncontinued to walk by Martin's side either in total silence, or in\r\nearnest, grave conversation; but by degrees these feelings wore off, and\r\nhis buoyant spirits gradually returned.\r\n\r\nThe country over which they had passed during the day was of a mingled\r\ncharacter. At one time they traversed a portion of dark forest, heavy and\r\nchoked up with the dense and gigantic foliage peculiar to those countries\r\nthat lie near to the equator; then they emerged from this upon what to\r\ntheir eyes seemed most beautiful scenery,--mingled plain and\r\nwoodland,--where the excessive brilliancy and beauty of the tropical\r\nvegetation was brought to perfection by exposure to the light of the blue\r\nsky and the warm rays of the sun. In such lovely spots they travelled\r\nmore slowly and rested more frequently, enjoying to the full the sight of\r\nthe gaily-coloured birds and insects that fluttered busily around them,\r\nand the delicious perfume of the flowers that decked the ground and\r\nclambered up the trees. At other times they came to plains, or _campos_,\r\nas they are termed, where there were no trees at all, and few shrubs, and\r\nwhere the grass was burned brown and dry by the sun. Over such they\r\nhurried as quickly as they could; and fortunately, where they chanced to\r\ntravel, such places were neither numerous nor extensive, although in some\r\ndistricts of Brazil there are campos hundreds of miles in extent.\r\n\r\nA small stream meandered through the forest, and enabled them to refresh\r\nthemselves frequently; which was very fortunate, for the heat, especially\r\ntowards noon, became extremely intense, and they could not have existed\r\nwithout water. So great, indeed, was the heat about mid-day, that, by\r\nmutual consent, they resolved to seek the cool shade of a spreading tree,\r\nand try to sleep if possible. At this time they learned, to their\r\nsurprise, that all animated nature did likewise, and sought repose at\r\nnoon. God had implanted in the breast of every bird and insect in that\r\nmighty forest an instinct which taught it to rest and find refreshment\r\nduring the excessive heat of mid-day; so that, during the space of two or\r\nthree hours, not a thing with life was seen, and not a sound was heard.\r\nEven the troublesome mosquitoes, so active at all other times, day and\r\nnight, were silent now. The change was very great and striking, and\r\ndifficult for those who have not observed it to comprehend. All the\r\nforenoon, screams, and cries, and croaks, and grunts, and whistles, ring\r\nout through the woods incessantly; while, if you listen attentively, you\r\nhear the low, deep, and never-ending buzz and hum of millions upon\r\nmillions of insects, that dance in the air and creep on every leaf and\r\nblade upon the ground. About noon all this is hushed. The hot rays of the\r\nsun beat perpendicularly down upon what seems a vast untenanted solitude,\r\nand not a single chirp breaks the death-like stillness of the great\r\nforest, with the solitary exception of the metallic note of the uruponga,\r\nor bell-bird, which seems to mount guard when all the rest of the world\r\nhas gone to sleep. As the afternoon approaches they all wake up,\r\nrefreshed by their siesta, active and lively as fairies, and ready for\r\nanother spell of work and another deep-toned noisy chorus.\r\n\r\nThe country through which our adventurers travelled, as evening\r\napproached, became gradually more hilly, and their march consequently\r\nmore toilsome. They were just about to give up all thought of proceeding\r\nfurther that night, when, on reaching the summit of a little hill, they\r\nbeheld a bright red light shining at a considerable distance in the\r\nvalley beyond. With light steps and hearts full of hope they descended\r\nthe hill and hastened towards it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE HERMIT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now quite dark, and the whole country seemed alive with\r\nfire-flies. These beautiful little insects sat upon the trees and bushes,\r\nspangling them as with living diamonds, and flew about in the air like\r\nlittle wandering stars. Barney had seen them before, in the West Indies,\r\nbut Martin had only heard of them; and his delight and amazement at their\r\nextreme brilliancy were very great. Although he was naturally anxious to\r\nreach the light in the valley, in the hope that it might prove to proceed\r\nfrom some cottage, he could not refrain from stopping once or twice to\r\ncatch these lovely creatures; and when he succeeded in doing so, and\r\nplaced one on the palm of his hand, the light emitted from it was more\r\nbrilliant than that of a small taper, and much more beautiful, for it was\r\nof a bluish colour, and very intense,--more like the light reflected from\r\na jewel than a flame of fire. He could have read a book by means of it\r\nquite easily.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour they drew near to the light, which they found proceeded\r\nfrom the window of a small cottage or hut.\r\n\r\n\"Whist, Martin,\" whispered Barney, as they approached the hut on tiptoe;\r\n\"there may be savages into it, an' there's no sayin' what sort o' craturs\r\nthey are in them parts.\"\r\n\r\nWhen about fifty yards distant, they could see through the open window\r\ninto the room where the light burned; and what they beheld there was well\r\ncalculated to fill them with surprise. On a rude wooden chair, at a rough\r\nunpainted table, a man was seated, with his head resting on his hand, and\r\nhis eyes fixed intently on a book. Owing to the distance, and the few\r\nleaves and branches that intervened between them and the hut, they could\r\nnot observe him very distinctly. But it was evident that he was a large\r\nand strong man, a little past the prime of life. The hair of his head and\r\nbeard was black and bushy, and streaked with silver-grey. His face was\r\nmassive, and of a dark olive complexion, with an expression of sadness on\r\nit, strangely mingled with stern gravity. His broad shoulders--and,\r\nindeed, his whole person--were enveloped in the coarse folds of a long\r\ngown or robe, gathered in at the waist with a broad band of leather.\r\n\r\nThe room in which he sat--or rather the hut, for there was but one room\r\nin it--was destitute of all furniture, except that already mentioned,\r\nbesides one or two roughly-formed stools; but the walls were completely\r\ncovered with strange-looking implements and trophies of the chase; and\r\nin a corner lay a confused pile of books, some of which were, from\r\ntheir appearance, extremely ancient. All this the benighted wanderers\r\nobserved as they continued to approach cautiously on tiptoe. So\r\ncautious did they become as they drew near, and came within the light\r\nof the lamp, that Barney at length attempted to step over his own\r\nshadow for fear of making a noise; and, in doing so, tripped and fell\r\nwith considerable noise through a hedge of prickly shrubs that\r\nencircled the strange man's dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe hermit--for such he appeared to be--betrayed no symptom of surprise\r\nor fear at the sudden sound; but, rising quietly though quickly from his\r\nseat, took down a musket that hung on the wall, and, stepping to the open\r\ndoor, demanded sternly, in the Portuguese language, \"Who goes there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, then, if ye'd help a fellow-cratur to rise, instead o' talkin'\r\ngibberish like that, it would be more to your credit!\" exclaimed the\r\nIrishman, as he scrambled to his feet and presented himself, along with\r\nMartin, at the hermit's door.\r\n\r\nA peculiar smile lighted up the man's features as he retreated into the\r\nhut, and invited the strangers to enter.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said he, in good English, although with a slightly foreign\r\naccent. \"I am most happy to see you. You are English. I know the voice\r\nand the language very well. Lived among them once, but long time past\r\nnow--very long. Have not seen one of you for many years.\"\r\n\r\nWith many such speeches, and much expression of good-will, the hospitable\r\nhermit invited Martin and his companion to sit down at his rude table, on\r\nwhich he quickly spread several plates of ripe and dried fruits, a few\r\ncakes, and a jar of excellent honey, with a stone bottle of cool water.\r\nWhen they were busily engaged with these viands, he began to make\r\ninquiries as to where his visitors had come from.\r\n\r\n\"We've comed from the sae,\" replied Barney, as he devoted himself to a\r\nmagnificent pineapple. \"Och but yer victuals is mighty good,\r\nMister--what's yer name?--'ticklerly to them that's a'most starvin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said Martin, \"our ship has been taken by pirates, and we\r\ntwo swam ashore, and lost ourselves in the woods; and now we have\r\nstumbled upon your dwelling, friend, which is a great comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoigh, an' that's true,\" sighed Barney, as he finished the last slice of\r\nthe pineapple.\r\n\r\nThey now explained to their entertainer all the circumstances attending\r\nthe capture of the _Firefly_, and their subsequent adventures and\r\nvicissitudes in the forest; all of which Barney detailed in a most\r\ngraphic manner, and to all of which their new friend listened with grave\r\nattention and unbroken silence. When they had concluded he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Very good. You have seen much in very short time. Perhaps you shall see\r\nmore by-and-by. For the present you will go to rest, for you must be\r\nfatigued. I will _think_ to-night,--to-morrow I will _speak_\"\r\n\r\n\"An', if I may make so bould,\" said Barney, glancing with a somewhat\r\nrueful expression round the hard earthen floor of the hut, \"where-abouts\r\nmay I take the liberty of sleepin'?\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit replied by going to a corner, whence, from beneath a heap of\r\nrubbish, he dragged two hammocks, curiously wrought in a sort of light\r\nnet-work. These he slung across the hut, at one end, from wall to wall,\r\nand, throwing a sheet or coverlet into each, he turned with a smile to\r\nhis visitors,--\r\n\r\n\"Behold your beds! I wish you a very good sleep,--adios!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, this strange individual sat down at the table, and was soon as\r\ndeeply engaged with his large book as if he had suffered no interruption;\r\nwhile Martin and Barney, having gazed gravely and abstractedly at him for\r\nfive minutes, turned and smiled to each other, jumped into their\r\nhammocks, and were soon buried in deep slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAN ENEMY IN THE NIGHT--THE VAMPIRE BAT--THE HERMIT DISCOURSES ON STRANGE,\r\nAND CURIOUS, AND INTERESTING THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Martin Rattler awoke with a feeling of lightness in his\r\nhead, and a sensation of extreme weakness pervading his entire frame.\r\nTurning his head round to the right he observed that a third hammock was\r\nslung across the further end of the hut; which was, no doubt, that in\r\nwhich the hermit had passed the night. But it was empty now. Martin did\r\nnot require to turn his head to the other side to see if Barney\r\nO'Flannagan was there, for that worthy individual made his presence\r\nknown, for a distance of at least sixty yards all round the outside of\r\nthe hut, by means of his nose, which he was in the habit of using as a\r\ntrumpet when asleep. It was as well that Martin did not require to look\r\nround; for he found, to his surprise, that he had scarcely strength to do\r\nso. While he was wondering in a dreamy sort of manner what could be the\r\nmatter with him, the hermit entered the hut bearing a small deer upon his\r\nshoulders. Resting his gun in a corner of the room, he advanced to\r\nMartin's hammock.\r\n\r\n\"My boy,\" he exclaimed, in surprise, \"what is wrong with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Martin, faintly; \"I think there is\r\nsomething wet about my feet.\"\r\n\r\nTurning up the sheet, he found that Martin's feet were covered with\r\nblood! For a few seconds the hermit growled forth a number of apparently\r\nvery pithy sentences in Portuguese, in a deep guttural voice, which\r\nawakened Barney with a start. Springing from his hammock with a bound\r\nlike a tiger, he exclaimed, \"Och! ye blackguard, would ye murther the boy\r\nbefore me very nose?\" and seizing the hermit in his powerful grasp, he\r\nwould infallibly have hurled him, big though he was, through his own\r\ndoorway, had not Martin cried out, \"Stop, stop, Barney. It's all right;\r\nhe's done nothing:\" on hearing which the Irishman loosened his hold, and\r\nturned towards his friend.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, honey?\" said Barney, in a soothing tone of voice, as\r\na mother might address her infant son. The hermit, whose composure had\r\nnot been in the slightest degree disturbed, here said--\r\n\r\n\"The poor child has been sucked by a vampire bat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ochone!\" groaned Barney, sitting down on the table, and looking at his\r\nhost with a face of horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, these are the worst animals in Brazil for sucking the blood of\r\nmen and cattle. I find it quite impossible to keep my mules alive, they\r\nare so bad.\"\r\n\r\nBarney groaned.\r\n\r\n\"They have killed two cows which I tried to keep here, and one young\r\nhorse--a foal you call him, I think; and now I have no cattle remaining,\r\nthey are so bad.\"\r\n\r\nBarney groaned again, and the hermit went on to enumerate the wicked\r\ndeeds of the vampire bats, while he applied poultices of certain herbs to\r\nMartin's toe, in order to check the bleeding, and then bandaged it up;\r\nafter which he sat down to relate to his visitors the manner in which the\r\nbat carries on its bloody operations. He explained, first of all, that\r\nthe vampire bats are so large and ferocious that they often kill horses\r\nand cattle by sucking their blood out. Of course they cannot do this at\r\none meal, but they attack the poor animals again and again, and the blood\r\ncontinues to flow from the wounds they make long afterwards, so that the\r\ncreatures attacked soon grow weak and die. They attack men, too,--as\r\nMartin knew to his cost; and they usually fix upon the toes and other\r\nextremities. So gentle are they in their operations, that sleepers\r\nfrequently do not feel the puncture, which they make, it is supposed,\r\nwith the sharp hooked nail of their thumb; and the unconscious victim\r\nknows nothing of the enemy who has been draining his blood until he\r\nawakens, faint and exhausted, in the morning.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the hermit told them that these vampire bats have very sharp,\r\ncarnivorous teeth, besides a tongue which is furnished with the curious\r\norgans by which they suck the life-blood of their fellow-creatures; that\r\nthey have a peculiar, leaf-like, overhanging lip; and that he had a\r\nstuffed specimen of a bat that measured no less than two feet across the\r\nexpanded wings, from tip to tip,\r\n\r\n\"Och, the blood-thirsty spalpeen!\" exclaimed Barney, as he rose and\r\ncrossed the room to examine the bat in question, which was nailed against\r\nthe wall. \"Bad luck to them, they've ruined Martin intirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no,\" remarked the hermit with a smile. \"It will do the boy much good\r\nthe loss of the blood; much good, and he will not be sick at all\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear you say so,\" said Martin, \"for it would be a great bore\r\nto be obliged to lie here when I've so many things to see. In fact I feel\r\nbetter already, and if you will be so kind as to give me a little\r\nbreakfast I shall be quite well,\"\r\n\r\nWhile Martin was speaking, the obliging hermit,--who, by the way, was now\r\nhabited in a loose short hunting-coat of brown cotton,--spread a\r\nplentiful repast upon his table; to which, having assisted Martin to get\r\nout of his hammock, they all proceeded to do ample justice: for the\r\ntravellers were very hungry after the fatigue of the previous day; and as\r\nfor the hermit, he looked like a man whose appetite was always sharp set\r\nand whose food agreed with him.\r\n\r\nThey had cold meat of several kinds, and a hot steak of venison just\r\nkilled that morning, which the hermit cooked while his guests were\r\nengaged with the other viands. There was also excellent coffee, and\r\nsuperb cream, besides cakes made of a species of coarse flour or meal,\r\nfruits of various kinds, arid very fine honey.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! ye've the hoith o' livin' here!\" cried Barney, smacking his lips\r\nas he held out his plate for another supply of a species of meat which\r\nresembled chicken in tenderness and flavour. \"What sort o' bird or baste\r\nmay that be, now, av' I may ask ye, Mister--what's yer name?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Carlos,\" replied the hermit, gravely; \"and this is the flesh\r\nof the Armadillo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arma--what--o?\" inquired Barney.\r\n\r\n\"Arma_dillo_,\" repeated the hermit. \"He is very good to eat, but very\r\ndifficult to catch. He digs down so fast we cannot catch him, and must\r\nsmoke him out of his hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you many cows?\" inquired Martin, as he replenished his cup\r\nwith coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Cows?\" echoed the hermit, \"I have got no cows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you get such capital cream, then?\" asked Martin in surprise.\r\n\r\nThe hermit smiled. \"Ah! my friends, that cream has come from a very\r\ncurious cow. It is from a cow that grows in the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grows!\" ejaculated his guests.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he grows. I will show him to you one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit's broad shoulders shook with a quiet internal laugh. \"I will\r\nexplain a little of that you behold on my table.\r\n\r\n\"The coffee I get from the trees. There are plenty of them here. Much\r\nmoney is made in Brazil by the export of coffee,--very much. The cakes\r\nare made from the mandioca-root, which I grow near my house. The root is\r\ndried and ground into flour, which, under the general _name farina_, is\r\nused all over the country. It is almost the only food used by the Indians\r\nand Negroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there are Injins and Niggers here, are there?\" inquired Barney.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a great many. Most of the Negroes are slaves; some of the Indians\r\ntoo; and the people who are descended from the Portuguese who came and\r\ntook the country long ago, they are the masters.--Well, the honey I get\r\nin holes in the trees. There are different kinds of honey here; some of\r\nit is _sour_ honey. And the fruits and roots, the plantains, and\r\nbananas, and yams, and cocoa-nuts, and oranges, and plums, all grow in\r\nthe forest, and much more besides, which you will see for yourselves if\r\nyou stay long here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a quare country, intirely,\" remarked Barney, as he wiped his mouth\r\nand heaved a sigh of contentment. Then, drawing his hand over his chin,\r\nhe looked earnestly in the hermit's face, and, with a peculiar twinkle in\r\nhis eye, said--\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose ye couldn't favour me with the lind of a raazor, could ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend; I never use that foolish weapon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, as there's only monkeys and jaguars, and sich like to see me,\r\nit don't much signify; but my mustaches is gitin' mighty long, for I've\r\nbeen two weeks already without a shave.\"\r\n\r\nMartin laughed heartily at the grave, anxious expression of his\r\ncomrade's face. \"Never mind, Barney,\" he said, \"a beard and moustache\r\nwill improve you vastly. Besides, they will be a great protection\r\nagainst mosquitoes; for you are such a hairy monster, that when they\r\ngrow nothing of your face will be exposed except your eyes and\r\ncheek-bones. And now,\" continued Martin, climbing into his hammock again\r\nand addressing the hermit, \"since you won't allow me to go out a-hunting\r\nto-day, I would like very much if you would tell me something more about\r\nthis strange country.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' may be,\" suggested Barney, modestly, \"ye won't object to tell us\r\nsomething about yersilf,--how you came for to live in this quare,\r\nsolitary kind of a way.\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit looked gravely from one to the other, and stroked his beard.\r\nDrawing his rude chair towards the door of the hut, he folded his arms,\r\nand crossed his legs, and gazed dreamily forth upon the rich landscape.\r\nThen, glancing again at his guests, he said, slowly: \"Yes, I will do what\r\nyou ask,--I will tell you my story.\"\r\n\r\n\"An', if I might make so bould as to inquire,\" said Barney, with a\r\ndeprecatory smile, while he drew a short black pipe from his pocket,\r\n\"have ye got such a thing as 'baccy in them parts?\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit rose, and going to a small box which stood in a corner,\r\nreturned with a quantity of cut tobacco in one hand, and a cigar not far\r\nshort of a foot long in the other! In a few seconds the cigar was going\r\nin full force, like a factory chimney; and the short black pipe glowed\r\nlike a miniature furnace, while its owner seated himself on a low stool,\r\ncrossed his arms on his breast, leaned his back against the door-post,\r\nand smiled,--as only an Irishman can smile under such circumstances. The\r\nsmoke soon formed a thick cloud, which effectually drove the mosquitoes\r\nout of the hut, and through which Martin, lying in his hammock, gazed out\r\nupon the sunlit orange and coffee trees, and tall palms with their rich\r\nfestoons of creeping plants, and sweet-scented flowers, that clambered\r\nover and round the hut and peeped in at the open door and windows, while\r\nhe listened to the hermit, who continued for at least ten minutes to\r\nmurmur slowly, between the puffs of his cigar, \"Yes, I will do it; I will\r\ntell you my story.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE HERMIT'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My ancestors,\" began the hermit, \"were among the first to land upon\r\nBrazil, after the country was taken possession of in the name of the King\r\nof Portugal, in the year 1500. In the first year of the century, Vincent\r\nYanez Pinçon, a companion of the famed Columbus, discovered Brazil; and\r\nin the next year, Pedro Alvarez Cabral, a Portuguese commander, took\r\npossession of it in the name of the King of Portugal. In 1503, Americus\r\nVespucius discovered the Bay of All Saints, and took home a cargo of\r\nBrazil-wood, monkeys and parrots; but no permanent settlement was\r\neffected upon the shores of the new continent, and the rich treasures of\r\nthis great country remained for some years longer buried and unknown to\r\nman,--for the wild Indians who lived here knew not their value.\r\n\r\n\"It was on a dark and stormy night in the year 1510. A group of swarthy\r\nand naked savages encircled a small fire on the edge of the forest on the\r\neast coast of Brazil. The spot where their watchfire was kindled is now\r\ncovered by the flourishing city of Bahia. At that time it was a\r\nwilderness. Before them stretched the noble bay which is now termed\r\n_Bahia de Todos Santos,_--All Saints' Bay.\r\n\r\n\"The savages talked earnestly and with excited looks as they stood upon\r\nthe shore, for the memory of the wondrous ships of the white men that\r\nhad visited them a few years before was deeply engraven on their minds;\r\nand now, in the midst of the howling storm, another ship was seen\r\napproaching their land. It was a small vessel, shattered and\r\ntempest-tossed, that drove into the Bahia de Todos Santos on that stormy\r\nnight. Long had it battled with the waves of the Atlantic, and the brave\r\nhearts that manned it had remained stanch to duty and strong in hope,\r\nremembering the recent glorious example of Columbus. But the storm was\r\nfierce and the bark was frail. The top-masts were broken and the sails\r\nrent; and worst of all, just as land hove in sight and cheered the\r\ndrooping spirits of the crew, a tremendous wave dashed upon the ship's\r\nstern and carried away the rudder.\r\n\r\n\"As they drove helplessly before the gale towards the shore, the naked\r\nsavages crowded down upon the beach and gazed in awe and astonishment at\r\nthe mysterious ship. A few of them had seen the vessels of Americus\r\nVespucius and Cabral. The rumour of the white men and their floating\r\ncastle had been wafted far and wide along the coast and into the interior\r\nof Brazil, and with breathless wonder the natives had listened to the\r\nstrange account. But now the vision was before them in reality. On came\r\nthe floating castle, the white foam dashing from her bows and the torn\r\nsails and ropes flying from her masts as she surged over the billows and\r\nloomed through the driving spray.\r\n\r\n\"It was a grand sight to see that ship dashing straight towards the shore\r\nat fearful speed; and those who looked on seemed to be impressed with a\r\nvague feeling that she had power to spring upon the strand and continue\r\nher swift career through the forest, as she had hitherto cleft her\r\npassage through the sea. As she approached, the savages shrank back in\r\nfear. Suddenly her frame trembled with a mighty shock. A terrible cry was\r\nborne to land by the gale, and all her masts went overboard. A huge wave\r\nlifted the vessel on its crest and flung her further on the shore, where\r\nshe remained firmly fixed, while the waves dashed in foam around her and\r\nsoon began to break her up. Ere this happened, however, a rope was thrown\r\nashore and fastened to a rock by the natives. By means of this the crew\r\nwere saved. But it would have been well for these bold navigators of\r\nPortugal if they had perished in the stormy sea, for they were spared by\r\nthe ocean only to be murdered by the wild savages on whose shore they had\r\nbeen cast.\r\n\r\n\"All were slain save one,--Diego Alvarez Carreo, the captain of the ship.\r\nBefore grasping the rope by which he reached the shore, he thrust several\r\ncartridges into his bosom and caught up a loaded musket. Wrapping the\r\nlock in several folds of cloth to keep it dry, he slid along the rope and\r\ngained the beach in safety. Here he was seized by the natives, and would\r\nno doubt have been barbarously slain with his unfortunate companions;\r\nbut, being a very powerful man, he dashed aside the foremost, and,\r\nbreaking through their ranks, rushed towards the wood. The fleet savages,\r\nhowever, overtook him in an instant, and were about to seize him when a\r\nyoung Indian woman interposed between them and their victim. This girl\r\nwas the chiefs daughter, and respect for her rank induced them to\r\nhesitate for a moment; but in another instant the Portuguese captain was\r\nsurrounded. In the scuffle that ensued his musket exploded, but\r\nfortunately wounded no one. Instantly the horrified savages fled in all\r\ndirections leaving Carreo alone!\r\n\r\n\"The captain was quick-witted. He knew that among hundreds of savages it\r\nwas madness to attempt either to fight or fly, and the happy effect of\r\nthe musket explosion induced him to adopt another course of action. He\r\ndrew himself up proudly to his full height, and beckoned the savages to\r\nreturn. This they did, casting many glances of fear at the dreaded\r\nmusket. Going up to one who, from his bearing and ornaments, seemed to be\r\na chief, Carreo laid his musket on the sand, and, stepping over it so\r\nthat he left it behind him, held out his hand frankly to the chief. The\r\nsavage looked at him in surprise, and suffered the captain to take his\r\nhand and pat it; after which he began to examine the stranger's dress\r\nwith much curiosity. Seeing that their chief was friendly to the white\r\nman, the other savages hurried him to the campfire, where he soon\r\nstripped off his wet clothes and ate the food which they put before him.\r\nThus Diego Carreo was spared.\r\n\r\n\"Next day, the Indians lined the beach and collected the stores of the\r\nwrecked vessel. While thus employed, Carreo shot a gull with his musket;\r\nwhich so astonished the natives that they regarded him with fear and\r\nrespect amounting almost to veneration. A considerable quantity of powder\r\nand shot was saved from the wreck, so that the captain was enabled to\r\nkeep his ascendency over the ignorant natives; and at length he became a\r\nman of great importance in the tribe, and married the daughter of the\r\nchief. He went by the name of _Caramuru_,--'The man of fire.' This man\r\nfounded the city of Bahia.\r\n\r\n\"The coasts of Brazil began soon after this to be settled in various\r\nplaces by the Portuguese; who, however, were much annoyed by the\r\nSpaniards, who claimed a share in the rich prize. The Dutch and English\r\nalso formed settlements; but the Portuguese still retained possession of\r\nthe country, and continued to prosper. Meanwhile Diego Caramuru, 'the man\r\nof fire,' had a son who in course of time became a prosperous settler;\r\nand as his sons grew up he trained them to become cultivators of the soil\r\nand traders in the valuable products of the New World. He took a piece of\r\nground, far removed from the spot where his father had been cast ashore,\r\nand a short distance in the interior of the country. Here the eldest sons\r\nof the family dwelt, laboured, and died, for many generations.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1808 Portugal was invaded by Napoleon Buonaparte, and the\r\nsovereign of that kingdom, John VI., fled to Brazil, accompanied by his\r\ncourt and a large body of emigrants. The king was warmly received by the\r\nBrazilians, and immediately set about improving the condition of the\r\ncountry. He threw open its ports to all nations; freed the land from all\r\nmarks of colonial dependence; established newspapers; made the press\r\nfree, and did everything to promote education and industry. But although\r\nmuch was done, the good was greatly hindered, especially in the inland\r\ndistricts, by the vice, ignorance, and stupidity of many of the Roman\r\nCatholic priests, who totally neglected their duties,--which, indeed,\r\nthey were incompetent to perform,--and in many instances, were no better\r\nthan miscreants in disguise, teaching the people vice instead of virtue.\r\n\r\n\"Foremost among the priests who opposed advancement was a descendant of\r\nthe 'man of fire,' Padre Caramuru dwelt for some years with an English\r\nmerchant in the capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. The padre was not an\r\nimmoral man, but he was a fiery bigot, and fiercely opposed everything\r\nthat tended to advance the education of the people. This he did, firmly\r\nbelieving that education was dangerous to the lower orders. His church\r\ntaught him, too, that the Bible was a dangerous book; and whenever a copy\r\nfell into his hands he immediately destroyed it. During the disturbances\r\nthat took place after the time of King John's departure for Portugal, and\r\njust before Brazil became an independent state under his son, the Emperor\r\nDon Pedro I., Padre Caramuru lost a beloved and only brother. He was\r\nquite a youth, and had joined the army only a few months previously, at\r\nthe desire of his elder brother the padre, who was so overwhelmed by the\r\nblow that he ceased to take an active part in church or political affairs\r\nand buried himself in a retired part of his native valley. Here he sought\r\nrelief and comfort in the study of the beauties of Nature by which he was\r\nsurrounded, but found none. Then he turned his mind to the doctrines of\r\nhis church, and took pleasure in verifying them from the Bible. But as he\r\nproceeded he found, to his great surprise, that these doctrines were,\r\nmany of them, not to be found there; nay, further, that some of them were\r\nabsolutely contradicted by the word of God.\r\n\r\n\"Padre Caramuru had been in the habit of commanding his people not to\r\nlisten to the Bible when any one offered to read it; but in the Bible\r\nitself he found these words, 'Search the Scriptures.' He had been in the\r\nhabit of praying to the Virgin Mary, and begging her to intercede with\r\nGod for him; but in the Bible he found these words: 'There is one\r\nmediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.' These things\r\nperplexed him much. But while he was thus searching, as it were, for\r\nsilver, the ignorant padre found gold! He found that he did not require\r\nto _work_ for salvation, but to _ask_ for it. He discovered that the\r\natonement had been made once for all by Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God;\r\nand he read with a thrilling heart these words: 'God so loved the world,\r\nthat he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him\r\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.'\r\n\r\n\"Long and earnestly did the padre ponder these words and pray over them;\r\nand gradually the Holy Spirit enlightened his mind, and he saw how\r\nhateful that system was which could forbid or discourage the reading of\r\nthe blessed word of God. He soon resolved to forsake the priesthood. But\r\nwhen he had done so, he knew not what to turn his hand to. He had no one\r\nlike-minded to consult with, and he felt that it was wrong to eat the\r\nbread of idleness. Being thus uncertain what to do, he resolved in the\r\nmeantime to carry goods into the interior of the country, and offer them\r\nfor sale. The land round his dwelling and his own gun would supply him\r\nwith food; and for the rest, he would spend his time in the study of the\r\nBible, and seek for more light and direction from God.\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" continued the hermit, \"is a slight sketch of the history of my\r\ncountry and of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yourself?\" exclaimed Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am the Padre Caramuru, or rather I _was_. I am Padre no longer,\r\nbut Senhor Carlos Caramuru, a merchant. Yet I know not what to do. When I\r\nlook round upon my country, and see how they know not the precious word\r\nof God, my heart burns in me, and I sometimes think that it is my duty to\r\ngo forth and preach.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt ye are right,\" said Barney. \"I've always bin of opinion that\r\nwhen a man feels very strong in his heart on any partic'lar subject, it's\r\na sure sign that the Almighty intends him to have something more to do\r\nwith that subject than other men who don't feel about it at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit remained silent for a few minutes. \"I think you are right,\r\nfriend,\" he said; \"but I am very ignorant yet. I have no one to explain\r\ndifficulties to me; and I fear to go about preaching, lest I should\r\npreach what is not true. I will study yet for a time, and pray. After\r\nthat, perhaps, I may go forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have told us nothing yet about the trade of the country,\" said\r\nMartin, \"or its size, or anything of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will soon tell you of that when I have lighted another cigar. This one\r\ndoes not draw well. Have you got a full pipe still, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Carrymooroo,\" replied Barney, knocking out the ashes.\r\n\"I'll jist load wance more, and then,--fire away.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the big cigar and short pipe were in full play, and the\r\nhermit continued:--\r\n\r\n\"This country is very large and very rich, but it is not well worked. The\r\npeople are lazy, many of them, and have not much enterprise. Much is\r\ndone, no doubt; but very much more _might_ be done.\r\n\r\n\"The empire of Brazil occupies nearly one-half of the whole continent of\r\nSouth America. It is 2600 miles long, and 2500 miles broad; which, as you\r\nknow perhaps, is a little larger than all Europe. The surface of the\r\ncountry is beautiful and varied. The hilly regions are very wild,\r\nalthough none of the mountains are very high, and the woods are\r\nmagnificent; but a great part of the land consists of vast grassy plains,\r\nwhich are called llanos, or campos, or silvas. The campos along the banks\r\nof the River Amazon are equal to six times the size of France; and there\r\nis one great plain which lies between the Sierra Ibiapaba and the River\r\nTocantins which is 600 miles long by 400 miles broad. There are very few\r\nlakes in Brazil, and only one worth speaking of--the Lagoa dos\r\nPlatos--which is 150 miles long. But our rivers are the finest in the\r\nwhole world, being so long, and wide, and deep, and free from falls, that\r\nthey afford splendid communication with the interior of the land. But,\r\nalas! there are few ships on these rivers yet, very few. The rivers in\r\nthe north part of Brazil are so numerous and interlaced that they are\r\nmuch like the veins in the human body; and the great River Amazon and a\r\nfew of its chief tributaries resemble the arteries.\r\n\r\n\"Then as to our produce,\" continued the hermit, \"who can tell it all? We\r\nexport sugar, and coffee, and cotton, and gold, silver, lead, zinc,\r\nquicksilver, and amethysts, and we have diamond mines--\"\r\n\r\n\"Di'mond mines!\" echoed Barney; \"och but I would like for to see them.\r\nSure they would sparkle most beautiful. Are they far off, Mr.\r\nCarrymooroo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very far off. Then we export dye-woods, and cabinet-woods, and\r\ndrugs, and gums, and hides,--a great many hides, for the campos are full\r\nof wild cattle, and men hunt them on horseback, and catch them with a\r\nlong rope called the _lasso_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I should like to have a gallop over these great plains,\"\r\nmurmured Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Then we have,\" continued the hermit, \"rice, tapioca, cocoa, maize,\r\nwheat, mandioca, beans, bananas, pepper, cinnamon, oranges, figs, ginger,\r\npineapples, yams, lemons, mangoes, and many other fruits and vegetables.\r\nThe mandioca you have eaten in the shape of farina. It is very good food;\r\none acre gives as much nutriment as six acres of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"Of the trees you have seen something. There are thousands of kinds, and\r\nmost magnificent. Some of them are more than thirty feet round about.\r\nThere are two hundred different kinds of palms, and so thick stand the\r\ngiant trees in many places, with creeping plants growing between, that it\r\nis not possible for man to cut his way through the forests in some parts.\r\nLanguage cannot describe the grandeur and glory of the Brazilian forests.\r\n\r\n\"We have numbers of wild horses, and hogs, and goats; and in the woods\r\nare tiger-cats, jaguars, tapirs, hyenas, sloths, porcupines, and--but you\r\nhave seen many things already. If you live you will see more. I need not\r\ntell you of these things; very soon I will show you some.\r\n\r\n\"The population of my country consists of the descendants of Portuguese\r\nsettlers, native Indians, and Negroes. Of the latter, some are free, some\r\nslaves. The Indians go about nearly naked. Most of them are in a savage\r\nstate: they paint their skins, and wear gaudy ornaments. The religion of\r\nthe country is Roman Catholic, but all religions are tolerated; and I\r\nhave much hope for the future of Brazil, in spite of the priests.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do ye git much out o' the di'mond mines?\" inquired Barney, whose\r\nmind was running on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"O yes, a great deal. Every year many are got, and Government gets\r\none-fifth of the value of all the gold and diamonds found in the country.\r\nOne diamond was found a short time ago which was worth £40,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye don't say so!\" exclaimed Barney in great surprise, as he blew an\r\nimmense cloud of smoke from his lips. \"Now, that's extror'nary. Why don't\r\neverybody go to the mines and dig up their fortin at wance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because men cannot _eat_ diamonds,\" replied the hermit gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Troth, I niver thought o' that; ye're right.\"\r\n\r\nMartin laughed heartily as he lay in his hammock and watched his friend's\r\nexpression while pondering this weighty subject.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" resumed the hermit, \"you will be surprised to hear that\r\ndiamond and gold finding is not the most profitable employment in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\"The man who cultivates the ground is better off than anybody. It is a\r\nfact, a very great fact, a fact that you should get firmly fixed in your\r\nmemory--that in less than _two years_ the exports of sugar and coffee\r\namounted to more than the value of all the diamonds found in _eighty_\r\nyears. Yes, that is true. But the people of Brazil are not well off. They\r\nhave everything that is necessary to make a great nation; but we are not\r\na great nation, far from it.\" The hermit sighed deeply as he ceased\r\nspeaking, and fell into an abstracted frame of mind.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great country intirely,\" said Barney, knocking the ashes out of\r\nhis pipe, and placing that much-loved implement carefully in his pocket;\r\n\"a great country, but there's a tremendous big screw loose somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems curious to me,\" said Martin, in a ruminating tone of voice,\r\n\"that people should not get on better in a country in which there is\r\neverything that man can desire to make him rich and happy. I wonder what\r\nit wants; perhaps it's too hot, and the people want energy of character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Want energy!\" shouted the hermit, leaping from his seat, and regarding\r\nhis guests for a few moments with a stern expression of countenance;\r\nthen, stretching forth his hand, he continued, in an excited tone:\r\n\"Brazil does not want energy; it has only one want,--it wants the Bible!\r\nWhen a country is sunk down in superstition and ignorance and moral\r\ndepravity, so that the people know not right from wrong, there is only\r\none cure for her,--the Bible. Religion here is a mockery and a shame;\r\nsuch as, if it were better known, would make the heathen laugh in scorn.\r\nThe priests are a curse to the land, not a blessing. Perhaps they are\r\nbetter in other lands,--I know not; but well I know they are many of\r\nthem false and wicked here. No truth is taught to the people,--no Bible\r\nis read in their ears; religion is not taught,--even morality is not\r\ntaught; men follow the devices and desires of their own hearts, and\r\nthere is no voice raised to say, 'You are doing wrong.' My country is\r\nsunk very low; and she cannot hope to rise, for the word of her Maker is\r\nnot in her hand. True, there are a few, a very few Bibles in the great\r\ncities; but that is all: that cannot save her hundreds of towns and\r\nvillages. Thousands of her people are slaves in body,--all, all are\r\nslaves in soul; and yet you ask me what she wants. Ha! she wants\r\n_truth_,--she wants to be purged of falsehood. She has bones and\r\nmuscles, and arteries and veins,--everything to make a strong and\r\nhealthy nation; but she wants blood,--she has no vital stream; yes,\r\nBrazil, my country, wants the Bible!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA HUNTING EXPEDITION, IN WHICH ARE SEEN STONES THAT CAN RUN, AND COWS\r\nTHAT REQUIRE NO FOOD--BESIDES A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER WITH A JAGUAR, AND\r\nOTHER STRANGE THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many weeks Martin Rattler and his friend Barney O'Flannagan continued\r\nto dwell with the hermit in his forest-home, enjoying his entertaining\r\nand instructive discourse, and joining with him in the hunting\r\nexpeditions which he undertook for the purpose of procuring fresh food\r\nfor his table. In these rambles they made constant discoveries of\r\nsomething new and surprising, both in reference to the vegetables and\r\nanimals of that extraordinary region of the earth. They also had many\r\nadventures,--some amusing and some terrible,--which we cannot enlarge on\r\nhere, for they would fill ten volumes such as this, were they to be all\r\nrecorded in detail.\r\n\r\nOne day the hermit roused them earlier than usual and told them to get\r\nready, as he intended to go a considerable distance that day, and he\r\nwished to reach a particular spot before the heat of noon. So Martin and\r\nBarney despatched breakfast in as short a time as possible, and the\r\nhermit read them a chapter out of his large and well-thumbed Bible, after\r\nwhich they equipped themselves for the chase.\r\n\r\nWhen Martin and his friend escaped from the pirates and landed on the\r\ncoast of Brazil, they were clothed in sailor-like costume, namely, white\r\nduck trousers, coloured flannel shirts, blue jackets, round straw hats,\r\nand strong shoes. This costume was not very suitable for the warm climate\r\nin which they now found themselves, so their hospitable friend the hermit\r\ngave them two loose light cotton coats or jackets, of a blue colour, and\r\nbroad brimmed straw hats similar to his own. He also gave them two\r\ncurious garments called _ponchos_. The poncho serves the purpose of cloak\r\nand blanket. It is simply a square dark-coloured blanket with a hole in\r\nthe middle of it, through which the head is thrust in rainy weather, and\r\nthe garment hangs down all round. At night the poncho is useful as a\r\ncovering. The hermit wore a loose open hunting coat, and underneath it a\r\ngirdle, in which was a long sharp knife and a brace of pistols. His\r\ntrousers were of blue-striped cotton. He usually carried a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun over his shoulder, and a powder-horn and bullet-bag\r\nwere slung round his neck. Barney now procured from this hospitable man a\r\nsupply of powder and shot for his large brass-mounted cavalry pistol. The\r\nhermit also made him a present of a long hunting-knife; and he gave one\r\nof a smaller size to Martin. As Martin had no weapon, the hermit\r\nmanufactured for him a stout bow and quiver full of arrows; with which,\r\nafter some practice, he became reasonably expert.\r\n\r\nThus armed they sallied forth, and, following the foot-path that\r\nconducted from the door of the hut to the brow of the hill opposite, they\r\nwere soon buried in the shades of the great forest. On this particular\r\nmorning Barney observed that the hermit carried with him a stout spear,\r\nwhich he was not usually in the habit of doing. Being of an inquisitive\r\ndisposition, he inquired the reason of his taking it.\r\n\r\n\"I expect to find a jaguar to-day,\" answered the hermit. \"I saw him\r\nyesterday go down into the small valley in which my cows grow. I will\r\nshow you my cows soon, Martin.\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit stopped short suddenly as he spoke, and pointed to a large\r\nbird, about fifty yards in advance of them. It seemed to bear a\r\nparticular ill-will to a round rough stone which it pecked most\r\nenergetically. After a few minutes the bird ceased its attacks and flew\r\noff; whereupon the rough stone opened itself out, and, running quickly\r\naway, burrowed into a little hole and disappeared!\r\n\r\n\"That is an armadillo,\" remarked the hermit, continuing to lead the way\r\nthrough the woods; \"it is covered with a coat of mail, as you see; and\r\nwhen enemies come it rolls itself up like a ball and lies like a hard\r\nstone till they go away. But it has four little legs, and with them it\r\nburrows so quickly that we cannot dig it up, and must smoke it out of\r\nits hole,--which I do often, because it is very good to eat, as you very\r\nwell know.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they continued thus to walk through the woods conversing, Martin\r\nand Barney were again interested and amused by the immense number of\r\nbrilliant parrots and toucans which swooped about, chattering from tree\r\nto tree, in large flocks. Sometimes thirty or forty of the latter would\r\ncome screaming through the woods and settle upon the dark-green foliage\r\nof a coffee-tree; the effect of which was to give the tree the appearance\r\nof having been suddenly loaded with ripe golden fruit. Then the birds\r\nwould catch sight of the travellers and fly screaming away, leaving the\r\ntree dark-green and fruitless as before. The little green parrots were\r\nthe most outrageously noisy things that ever lived. Not content with\r\nscreaming when they flew, they continued to shriek, apparently with\r\ndelight, while they devoured the seeds of the gorgeous sun-flowers: and\r\nmore than once Martin was prompted to scatter a handful of stones among\r\nthem, as a hint to be less noisy; but this only made them worse,--like a\r\nbad baby, which, the more you tell it to be quiet, sets to work the more\r\nearnestly to increase and add to the vigour of its roaring. So Martin\r\nwisely let the parrots alone. They also startled, in passing through\r\nswampy places, several large blue herons, and long-legged cranes; and on\r\nmany of the trees they observed the curious hanging nests of a bird,\r\nwhich the hermit told them was the large oriole. These nests hung in long\r\nstrings from the tops of the palm-trees, and the birds were very actively\r\nemployed moving about and chattering round their swinging villages: on\r\nseeing which Martin could not help remarking that it would astonish the\r\ncolony not a little, if the top house were to give way and let all the\r\nmansions below come tumbling to the ground!\r\n\r\nThey were disappointed, however, in not seeing monkeys gambolling among\r\nthe trees, as they had expected.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my friends,\" said the hermit, \"travellers in my country are very\r\noften disappointed. They come here expecting to see everything all at\r\nonce; but although there are jaguars, and serpents, and bears, and\r\nmonkeys, plenty of them, as your ears can tell you, these creatures keep\r\nout of the sight of man as much as possible. They won't come out of the\r\nwoods and show themselves to please travellers! You have been very lucky\r\nsince you arrived. Many travellers go about for months together and do\r\nnot see half so much as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's thrue,\" observed Barney, with his head a little on one side, and\r\nhis eyes cast up in a sort of meditative frown, as if he were engaged in\r\nsubjecting the hermit's remarks to a process of severe philosophical\r\ncontemplation; \"but I would be very well plazed av the wild bastes would\r\nshow themselves now and then, for--\"\r\n\r\nMartin Rattler burst into a loud laugh, for Barney's upward glance of\r\ncontemplation was suddenly transformed into a gaze of intense\r\nastonishment, as he beheld the blue countenance of a large red monkey\r\nstaring down upon him from amid the branches of an overhanging tree. The\r\nmonkey's face expressed, if possible, greater surprise than that of the\r\nIrishman, and its mouth was partially open and thrust forward in a sort\r\nof threatening and inquiring manner. There seemed to be some bond of\r\nsympathy between the monkey and the man, for while _its_ mouth opened\r\n_his_ mouth opened too.\r\n\r\n\"A-a-a-a-a--ah!\" exclaimed the monkey.\r\n\r\nA facetious smile overspread Barney's face--\"Och! be all manes; the same\r\nto you, kindly,\" said he, taking off his hat and making a low bow.\r\n\r\nThe civility did not seem to be appreciated, however; for the monkey put\r\non a most indignant frown and displayed a terrific double-row of long\r\nbrilliant teeth and red gums, while it uttered a shriek of passion,\r\ntwisted its long tail round a branch, and hurled itself, with a motion\r\nmore like that of a bird than a beast, into the midst of the tree and\r\ndisappeared, leaving Martin and Barney and the hermit each with a very\r\nbroad grin on his countenance.\r\n\r\nThe hunters now arrived at an open space where there were several large\r\numbrageous trees, and as it was approaching mid-day they resolved to rest\r\nhere for a couple of hours. Birds and insects were gradually becoming\r\nmore and more silent, and soon afterwards the only sounds that broke upon\r\ntheir ears were the curious metallic notes of the urupongas, or\r\nbell-birds; which were so like to the rapid beating of a smith's hammer\r\non an anvil, that it was with the greatest difficulty Barney was\r\nrestrained from going off by himself in search of the \"smiddy.\" Indeed he\r\nbegan to suspect that the worthy hermit was deceiving him, and was only\r\nfully convinced at last when he saw one of the birds. It was pure white,\r\nabout the size of a thrush, and had a curious horn or fleshy tubercle\r\nupon its head.\r\n\r\nHaving rested and refreshed themselves, they resumed their journey a\r\nshort time before the noisy inhabitants of the woods recommenced their\r\nactive afternoon operations.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what's that?\" cried Barney, starting back and drawing his pistol,\r\nwhile Martin hastily fitted an arrow to his bow.\r\n\r\nNot ten paces in front of them a frightful monster ran across their path,\r\nwhich seemed so hideous to Martin that his mind instantly reverted to the\r\nfable of St. George and the Dragon, and he almost expected to see fire\r\nissuing from its mouth. It was a huge lizard, with a body about three\r\nfeet long, covered with bright scales. It had a long, thick tail. Its\r\nhead was clumsy and misshapen, and altogether its aspect was very\r\nhorrible. Before either Martin or Barney could fire, the hermit dropped\r\nhis gun and spear, sprang quickly forward, caught the animal by the tail,\r\nand, putting forth his great strength to the utmost, swung it round his\r\nhead and dashed its brains out against a tree.\r\n\r\nBarney and Martin could only stare with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"This we call an iguana,\" said the hermit, as he piled a number of heavy\r\nstones on the carcase to preserve it from other animals. \"It is very good\r\nto eat,--as good as chicken. This is not a very big one; they are\r\nsometimes five feet long, but almost quite harmless,--not venomous at\r\nall; and the only means he has to defend himself is the tail, which is\r\nvery powerful, and gives a tremendously hard blow; but, as you see, if\r\nyou catch him quick he can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well for you, or even Barney here, to talk of catching him\r\nby the tail,\" said Martin, smiling; \"but it would have puzzled me to\r\nswing that fellow round my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! ye're right, boy; I doubt if I could have done it mesilf,\"\r\nsaid Barney.\r\n\r\n\"No fear,\" said the hermit, patting Martin's broad shoulders as he passed\r\nhim and led the way; \"you will be strong enough for that very soon,--as\r\nstrong as me in a year or two.\"\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded down into a somewhat dark and closely wooded valley,\r\nthrough which meandered a small rivulet. Here they had some difficulty in\r\nforcing their way through the dense underwood and broad leaves, most of\r\nwhich seemed very strange to Martin and his comrade, being so gigantic.\r\nThere were also many kinds of ferns, which sometimes arched over their\r\nheads and completely shut out the view, while some of them crept up the\r\ntrees like climbing-plants. Emerging from this, they came upon a more\r\nopen space, in the midst of which grew a number of majestic trees.\r\n\r\n\"There are my cows!\" said the hermit, pausing as he spoke, and pointing\r\ntowards a group of tall straight-stemmed trees that were the noblest in\r\nappearance they had yet seen. \"Good cows they are,\" he continued, going\r\nup to one and making a notch in the bark with his axe: \"they need no\r\nfeeding or looking after, yet, as you see, they are always ready to give\r\nme cream.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, a thick white liquid flowed from the notch in the bark\r\ninto a cocoa-nut drinking-cup, which the hermit always carried at his\r\ngirdle. In a few minutes he presented his visitors with a draught of what\r\nthey declared was most excellent cream.\r\n\r\nThe masseranduba, or milk-tree, as it is called, is indeed one of the\r\nmost wonderful of all the extraordinary trees in the forests of Brazil,\r\nand is one among many instances of the bountiful manner in which God\r\nprovides for the wants of His creatures. No doubt this might with equal\r\ntruth be said of all the gifts that a beneficent Creator bestows upon\r\nmankind; but when, as in the case of this milk-tree, the provision for\r\nour wants comes in a singular and striking manner, it seems fitting and\r\nappropriate that we should specially acknowledge the gift as coming from\r\nthe hand of Him who giveth us all things liberally to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe milk-tree rises with a straight stem to an enormous height, and the\r\nfruit, about the size of a small apple, is full of rich and juicy pulp,\r\nand is very good. The timber, also, is hard, fine-grained, and\r\ndurable,--particularly adapted for such works as are exposed to the\r\nweather. But its most remarkable peculiarity is the rich vegetable milk\r\nwhich flows in abundance from it when the bark is cut. This milk is so\r\nlike to that of the cow in taste, that it can scarcely be distinguished\r\nfrom it, having only a very slight peculiarity of flavour, which is\r\nrather agreeable than otherwise. In tea and coffee it has the same effect\r\nas rich cream, and, indeed, is so thick that it requires to be diluted\r\nwith water before being used. This milk is also employed as glue. It\r\nhardens when exposed to the air, and becomes very tough and slightly\r\nelastic, and is said to be quite as good and useful as ordinary glue.\r\n\r\nHaving partaken of as much milk as they desired, they continued their\r\njourney a little further, when they came to a spur of the sierra, or\r\nmountain range, that cuts through that part of the country. Here the\r\nground became more rugged, but still densely covered with wood, and rocks\r\nlay piled about in many places, forming several dark and gloomy caverns.\r\nThe hermit now unslung his gun and advanced to the foot of a cliff, near\r\nthe further end of which there were several caves, the mouths of which\r\nwere partially closed with long ferns and masses of luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"Now we must be prepared,\" said the hermit, feeling the point of his\r\nspear. \"I think there is a jaguar here. I saw him yesterday, and I am\r\nquite sure he will not go away till he tries to do some mischief. He\r\nlittle knows that there is nothing here to hurt but me.\" The hermit\r\nchuckled as he said this, and resting his gun against the cliff near the\r\nentrance to the first cave, which was a small one, he passed on to the\r\nnext. Holding the spear in his left hand, he threw a stone violently into\r\nthe cavern. Barney and Martin listened and gazed in silent expectation;\r\nbut they only heard the hollow sound of the falling stone as it dashed\r\nagainst the sides of the cave; then all was still.\r\n\r\n\"Och, then, he's off,\" cried Barney.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said Martin; \"don't speak till he has tried the other cave.\"\r\n\r\nWithout taking notice of their remarks, the hermit repeated the\r\nexperiment at the mouths of two caverns further on, with the like result.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe the spalpeen's hidin' in the little cave where ye laid down yer\r\ngun,\" suggested Barney, going towards the place as he spoke. \"Och, then,\r\ncome here, friend; sure it must be the mouth of a mine, for there's two\r\no' the beautifulest di'monds I iver--\"\r\n\r\nBarney's speech was cut short by a low peculiar sound, that seemed like\r\nthe muttering of far-distant thunder. At the same moment the hermit\r\npulled him violently back, and, placing himself in a firm attitude full\r\nin front of the cavern, held the point of the spear advanced before him.\r\n\r\n\"Martin,\" he whispered, \"shoot an arrow straight into that hole,--quick!\"\r\n\r\nMartin obeyed, and the arrow whizzed through the aperture. Instantly\r\nthere issued from it a savage and tremendous roar, so awful that it\r\nseemed as if the very mountain were bellowing and that the cavern were\r\nits mouth. But not a muscle of the hermit's figure moved. He stood like a\r\nbronze statue,--his head thrown back and his chest advanced, with one\r\nfoot planted firmly before him and the spear pointing towards the cave.\r\nIt seemed strange to Martin that a man should face what appeared to him\r\nunknown danger so boldly and calmly; but he did not consider that the\r\nhermit knew exactly the amount of danger before him. He knew precisely\r\nthe manner in which it would assail him, and he knew just what was\r\nnecessary to be done in order to avert it; and in the strength of that\r\nknowledge he stood unmoved, with a slight smile upon his tightly\r\ncompressed lips.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the roar ceased when it was repeated with tenfold\r\nfierceness; the bushes and fern leaves shook violently, and an enormous\r\nand beautifully spotted jaguar shot through the air as if it had been\r\ndischarged from a cannon's mouth. The hermit's eye wavered not; he bent\r\nforward a hair's-breadth; the glittering spear-point touched the animal's\r\nbreast, pierced through it, and came out at its side below the ribs. But\r\nthe force of the bound was too great for the strength of the weapon: the\r\nhandle snapped in twain, and the transfixed jaguar struck down the hermit\r\nand fell writhing upon him!\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the moment Barney drew his pistol from his belt and\r\nsnapped it at the animal. It was well for the hermit at that moment that\r\nBarney had forgotten to prime his weapon; for, although he aimed at the\r\njaguar's skull, there is no doubt whatever that he would have blown out\r\nthe hermit's brains. Before he could make a second attempt, Martin sprang\r\ntowards the gun which leaned against the cliff, and, running quickly up,\r\nhe placed the muzzle close to the jaguar's ear and lodged a bullet in its\r\nbrain. All this was done in a few seconds, and the hermit regained his\r\nlegs just as the animal fell dead. Fortunately he was not hurt, having\r\nadroitly avoided the sharp claws of his enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! Mister Hermit,\" said Barney, wiping the perspiration from his\r\nforehead, \"it's yersilf that was well-nigh done for this time, an' no\r\nmistake. Did iver I see sich a spring! an' ye stud the charge jist like a\r\nstone wall,--niver moved a fut!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not hurt?\" inquired Martin, somewhat anxiously; \"your face is\r\nall covered with blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, boy, but it is the blood of the jaguar; thanks to you for your\r\nquick hand, I am not hurt at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit washed his face in the neighbouring brook, and then proceeded\r\nto skin the jaguar, the carcase being worthless. After which they\r\nretraced their steps through the woods as quickly as possible, for the\r\nday was now far spent, and the twilight, as we have before remarked, is\r\nso short in tropical latitudes that travellers require to make sure of\r\nreaching the end of the day's journey towards evening, unless they choose\r\nto risk losing their way, and spending the night in the forest.\r\n\r\nThey picked up the iguana in passing; and, on reaching the spot where the\r\narmadillo had burrowed, the hermit paused and kindled a small fire over\r\nthe hole, by means of his flint, steel, and tinder-box. He thus contrived\r\nto render the creature's habitation so uncomfortable that it rushed\r\nhurriedly out; then, observing that its enemies were waiting, it doubled\r\nits head and tail together, and became the image of a rough stone.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" said Martin, as the hermit killed it, \"that reminds me of\r\nthe ostrich of the desert, which, I'm told, when it is chased over the\r\nplains by men on horseback, and finds that it cannot escape, thrusts its\r\nhead into a bush, and fancies, no doubt, that it cannot be seen, although\r\nits great body is visible a mile off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin,\" said Barney, \"this arth is full o' quare craturs intirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, Barney; and not the least 'quare' among them is an\r\nIrishman, a particular friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hould yer tongue, ye spalpeen, or I'll put yer head in the wather!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish ye would, Barney, for it is terribly hot and mosquito-bitten, and\r\nyou couldn't have suggested anything more delightful. But here we are\r\nonce more at our forest home; and now for a magnificent cup of coffee and\r\na mandioca-cake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to mintion,\" added Barney, \"a juicy steak of Igu Anny, an' a tender\r\nchop o' Army Dillo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMARTIN AND BARNEY CONTINUE THEIR TRAVELS, AND SEE STRANGE\r\nTHINGS--AMONG OTHERS, THEY SEE LIVING JEWELS--THEY GO TO SEE A\r\nFESTA--THEY FIGHT AND RUN AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Rattler and Barney O'Flannagan soon after this began to entertain\r\na desire to travel further into the interior of Brazil, and behold with\r\ntheir own eyes the wonders of which they had heard so much from their\r\nkind and hospitable friend the hermit. Martin was especially anxious to\r\nsee the great river Amazon, about which he entertained the most romantic\r\nideas,--as well he might, for there is not such another river in the\r\nworld for size, and for the many curious things connected with its waters\r\nand its banks. Barney, too, was smitten with an intense desire to visit\r\nthe diamond mines, which he fancied must be the most brilliant and\r\nbeautiful sight in the whole world; and when Martin asked him what sort\r\nof place he expected to see, he used to say that he \"pictur'd in his mind\r\na great many deep and lofty caverns, windin' in an' out an' round about,\r\nwith the sides and the floors and the ceilin's all of a blaze with\r\nglittering di'monds, an' top'zes, an' purls, an' what not; with Naiggurs\r\nbe the dozen picking them up in handfuls. An' sure,\" he would add, \"if we\r\nwas wance there, we could fill our pockets in no time, an' then, hooray\r\nfor ould Ireland! an' live like Imperors for ivermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget, Barney, the account the hermit has given us of the\r\nmines. He evidently does not think that much is to be made of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! niver mind the hermit. There's always good luck attends Barney\r\nO'Flanngan; an' sure if nobody wint for fear they would git nothing, all\r\nthe di'monds that iver came out o' the mines would be lyin' there still;\r\nan' didn't he tell us there was wan got only a short time since, worth I\r\ndon't know how many thousand pounds? Arrah! if I don't go to the mines\r\nan' git one the size o' me head, I'll let ye rig me out with a long tail\r\nan' set me adrift in the woods for a blue-faced monkey.\"\r\n\r\nIt so happened that this was the time when the hermit was in the habit of\r\nsetting out on one of his trading trips; and when Martin told him of the\r\ndesire that he and Barney entertained to visit the interior, he told them\r\nthat he would be happy to take them along with him, provided they would\r\nact the part of muleteers. To this they readily agreed, being only too\r\nglad of an opportunity of making some return to their friend, who refused\r\nto accept any payment for his hospitality, although Barney earnestly\r\nbegged of him to accept of his watch, which was the only object of value\r\nhe was possessed of,--and that wasn't worth much, being made of\r\npinch-beck, and utterly incapable of going! Moreover, he relieved their\r\nminds, by telling them that they would easily obtain employment as\r\ncanoe-men on the Amazon, for men were very difficult to be got on that\r\nriver to man the boats; and if they could stand the heat, and were\r\nwilling to work like Indians, they might travel as far as they pleased.\r\nTo which Martin replied, in his ignorance, that he thought he could stand\r\nanything; and Barney roundly asserted that, having been burnt to a cinder\r\nlong ago in the \"East Injies,\" it was impossible to overdo him any more.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, therefore, they started three weeks later to\r\nvisit a populous town about twenty miles off, from which they set out on\r\ntheir travels, with a string of heavily laden mules, crossed the low\r\ncountries or campos lying near to the sea, and began to ascend the\r\nsierras that divide this portion of Brazil from the country which is\r\nwatered by the innumerable rivers that flow into the mighty Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade consisted of ten mules, each with two goodly sized bales of\r\nmerchandise on its back. They were driven and attended to by Negroes,\r\nwhose costume consisted of a light cotton shirt with short sleeves, and a\r\npair of loose cotton drawers reaching down to the knee. With the\r\nexception of a straw hat this was all they wore. Martin, and Barney, and\r\nthe hermit each bestrode a mule, with a small bale slung on either side;\r\nover the front of which their legs dangled comfortably. They had ponchos\r\nwith them, strapped to the mules' backs, and each carried a clumsy\r\numbrella to shield him from the fierce rays of the sun; but our two\r\nadventurers soon became so hardened and used to the climate, that they\r\ndispensed with the umbrellas altogether.\r\n\r\nThe sierra, or mountain range, over which they passed was about thirty\r\nmiles in extent, being in some places quite level and open, but in others\r\nsomewhat rugged and covered with large but thinly scattered trees, the\r\nmost common of which had fine dark-green glossy leaves, with spikes of\r\nbright yellow flowers terminating the branchlets. There were also many\r\npeculiar shrubs and flowering plants, of a sort that the travellers had\r\nnever seen the like of in their native land.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish,\" said Martin with a sigh, as he rode along beside his friend\r\nBarney, \"that I knew something of botany.\"\r\n\r\nBarney opened his eyes in surprise. \"Arrah! it's too much of a\r\nphilosopher ye are already, lad. What good would it do ye to know all the\r\nhard names that men have given to the flowers? Sure I wance wint after\r\nthe doctor o' a ship, to carry his box for him when he wint on what he\r\ncalled botanical excursions; and the poor cratur used to be pokin' his\r\nnose for iver down at the ground, an' peerin' through his green\r\nspectacles at miserable bits o' plants, an' niver seemin' to enjoy\r\nanything; when all the time _I_ was lookin' far fornint me, an' all\r\naround me, an' up at the sky, seem' ivery beautiful thing, and snifterin'\r\nup the sweet smells, an' in fact enjoyin' the whole univarse--an my pipe\r\nto boot--like an intelligent cratur.\" Barney looked round as he spoke,\r\nwith a bland, self-satisfied expression of countenance, as if he felt\r\nthat he had given a lucid definition of the very highest style of\r\nphilosophy, and proved that he, Barney O'Flannagan, was possessed of the\r\nsame in no common degree.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Barney,\" rejoined Martin, \"since you give me credit for being a\r\nphilosopher, I must continue to talk philosophically. Your botanical\r\nfriend took a _microscopic_ view of nature, while you took a _telescopic_\r\nview of it. Each view is good, but both views are better; and I can't\r\nhelp wishing that I were more of a philosopher than I am, especially in\r\nreference to botany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Barney, who seemed not quite to understand his young\r\nfriend, \"yer observations are remarkably thrue, and do ye great credit,\r\nfor yer years. Ah! Mr. Hermit, good luck to ye! I'm glad to see that\r\nye've got some consideration for man and baste. I'm quite ready for my\r\nvictuals, and so's my mule; aren't you, avic?\"\r\n\r\nBarney's latter remark was addressed to his patient charger, from whose\r\nback he sprang as he spoke, and slackened its girths.\r\n\r\nIt was now approaching mid-day, and the hermit had pitched upon a large\r\ntree as a fitting spot for rest and refreshment. Water had been brought\r\nup the mountain in a huge calabash; but they did not require to use it,\r\nas they found a quantity in the hollow stump of a tree. There were\r\nseveral frogs swimming about in this miniature lake; but it was found to\r\nbe fresh and clear and good notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nTowards evening they passed a string of mules going towards the town\r\nwhich they had just left. They were driven by Negroes, most of whom were\r\nslaves, and nearly quite naked. A Brazilian merchant, wearing a\r\npicturesque broad-brimmed, high-crowned straw-hat, a poncho, and brown\r\nleather boots armed at the heels with large sharp spurs, rode at the\r\nhead, and gave the strangers a surly nod of his head as they passed. Soon\r\nafter, they descended into the plain, and came to a halt at a sort of\r\nroadside public-house, where there was no sleeping accommodation, but\r\nwhere they found an open shed in which travellers placed their goods, and\r\nslung their hammocks, and attended to themselves. At the venda, close\r\nbeside it, they purchased a large bag of farina, being short of that\r\nnecessary article of food, and then set to work to prepare supper in the\r\nopen air; while the merry Negroes, who seemed to enjoy life most\r\nthoroughly, laughed and sang as they removed the bales from the mules'\r\nbacks and cooked their simple fare.\r\n\r\nBarney's cooking propensities now came into full play; and, with the\r\nvariety of fruits and vegetables which the country afforded, he exercised\r\nhis ingenuity, and produced several dishes of so savoury a nature that\r\nthe hermit was compelled to open his eyes in amazement, and smack his\r\nlips with satisfaction, being quite unable to express his sentiments in\r\nwords. While thus busily and agreeably employed, they were told by the\r\nowner of the venda that a festa was being celebrated at a village about a\r\nleague distant from where they stood.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see it above all things,\" said Martin eagerly; \"could\r\nwe not go?\"\r\n\r\nThe hermit frowned. \"Yes, we can go, but it will be to behold\r\nfolly. Perhaps it will be a good lesson, from which much may be\r\nlearned. We will go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a step that I'll budge till I've finished me pipe,\" said\r\nBarney, pulling away at that bosom friend with unexampled energy. \"To\r\nsmoke,\" he continued, winking gently with one eye, \"is the first law of\r\nnature; jist give me ten minutes more, an' _I'm_ your man for anything,\"\r\n\r\nBeing a fine evening, they proceeded on foot. In about an hour after\r\nsetting out they approached the village, which lay in a beautiful valley\r\nbelow them. Sounds of mirth and music rose like a distant murmur on the\r\nair, and mingled with the songs of birds and insects. Then the sun went\r\ndown, and in a few minutes it grew dark, while the brilliant fire-flies\r\nbegan their nocturnal gambols. Suddenly a bright flame burst over the\r\nvillage, and a flight of magnificent rockets shot up into the sky, and\r\nburst in a hundred bright and variously-coloured stars, which paled for a\r\nfew seconds the lights of nature. But they vanished in a moment, and the\r\nclear stars shed abroad their undying lustre,--seeming, in their quiet,\r\nunfading beauty, a gentle satire on the short-lived and gairish\r\nproductions of man.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty purty, no doubt,\" exclaimed Barney. \"Is this the Imperor's\r\nbirth-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the hermit, shaking his head; \"that is the way in which the\r\nfalse priests amuse the people. The poor Indian and the Negro, and,\r\nindeed, the ignorant Brazilian, thinks it very grand; and the priests let\r\nthem think it is pleasing to the God of heaven. Ah! here comes an old\r\nNegro; we will ask him.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral country people, in varied and picturesque costumes, hurried past\r\nthe travellers towards the village; and as they came to a foot-path that\r\njoined the road, an old Negro approached them. Saluting him in the\r\nPortuguese language, the hermit said, \"Friend, why do they let off\r\nrockets to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"For Dios\" (for God), answered the old man, looking and pointing upwards\r\nwith grave solemnity. Without vouchsafing another word, he hurried away.\r\n\r\n\"So they think,\" said the hermit, \"and so they are taught by the priests.\r\nMusic, noise, and fire-works please these ignorant people; and so the\r\npriests, who are mostly as ignorant as the people, tell them it is a good\r\npart of religious ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nPresently a band of young girls came laughing and singing along the road.\r\nThey were dressed in pure white, their rich black tresses being uncovered\r\nand ornamented with flowers, and what appeared to be bright jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" exclaimed Martin, gazing after them; \"what splendid jewels!\r\nsurely these must be the daughters of very rich people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, but they've been at the di'mond mines for certain! Did iver ye sae\r\nthe like?\"\r\n\r\nThe girls did indeed seem to blaze with jewels, which not only sparkled\r\nin their hair, but fringed their white robes, and were worked round the\r\nedges of their slippers; so that a positive light shone around their\r\npersons, and fell upon the path like a halo, giving them more the\r\nappearance of lovely supernatural beings than the daughters of earth.\r\n\r\n\"These jewels,\" said the hermit, \"were never polished by the hands of\r\nmen. They are fire-flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire-flies!\" exclaimed Martin and Barney simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are living fire-flies. The girls very often catch them and tie\r\nthem up in little bits of gauze, and put them, as you see, on their\r\ndresses and in their hair. To my mind they seem more beautiful far than\r\ndiamonds. Sometimes the Indians, when they travel at night, fix\r\nfire-flies to their feet, and so have good lamps to their path.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Barney was expressing his surprise at this information, in very\r\nracy language, they entered the village; and, mingling with the throng of\r\nholiday-keepers, followed the stream towards the grand square.\r\n\r\nThe church, which seemed to be a centre of attraction, and was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated, was a neat wooden building with two towers. The\r\nstreets of the village were broad and straggling; and so luxuriant was\r\nthe vegetation, and so lazy the nature of the inhabitants, that it seemed\r\nas if the whole place were overgrown with gigantic weeds. Shrubs and\r\ncreeping-plants grew in the neglected gardens, climbed over the palings,\r\nand straggled about the streets. Plants grew on the tops of the houses,\r\nferns peeped out under the eaves; and, in short, on looking at it one had\r\nthe feeling that ere long the whole place, people and all, must be\r\nsmothered in superabundant vegetation!\r\n\r\nThe houses were all painted white or yellow, with the doors and windows\r\nbright green,--just like grown-up toys; and sounds of revelry, with now\r\nand then the noise of disputation, issued from many of them.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe minutely the appearance of the motley crowd\r\nthrough which our adventurers elbowed their way, gazing curiously on the\r\nstrange scene, which seemed to them more like a dream than reality, after\r\ntheir long sojourn in the solitudes of the forest. Processions headed by\r\nlong-robed priests with flambeaux and crucifixes; young girls in light\r\ncostumes and long white cotton shawls, selling sweet cakes of mandioca\r\nflour, and bonbons; swarthy Brazilians, some in white jackets, loose\r\ncotton drawers, and straw hats, others in brown leather boots and\r\nponchos; Negroes in short white drawers and shirts, besides many without\r\nany clothing above their waists; Indians from the interior,\r\ncopper-coloured, and some of them, fine-looking men, having only a strip\r\nof cloth about their loins;--such were the strange crew whose loud voices\r\nadded to the whiz of rockets, squibs, crackers, guns, and musical\r\ninstruments, created a deafening noise.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the village there was a tree of such enormous size that\r\nit quite took our travellers by surprise. It was a wild fig-tree, capable\r\nof sheltering a thousand persons under its shadow! Here a spirited\r\nfandango was going on, and they stood for some time watching the\r\nmovements of the performers. Growing tired of this, they wandered about\r\nuntil they came to a less crowded part of the village, and entered a\r\npleasant grove of trees skirting the road by which they had arrived.\r\nWhile sauntering here, enjoying the cool night breeze and delicious\r\nperfume of flowers, a woman uttered a piercing shriek near to them. It\r\nwas instantly followed by loud voices in altercation. Ever ready to fly\r\nto the help of womankind, and, generally, to assist in a \"row,\" Barney\r\ndarted through the bushes, and came upon the scene of action just in time\r\nto see the white skirt of a female's dress disappear down an avenue, and\r\nto behold two Brazilians savagely writhing in mortal strife. At the\r\nmoment he came up, one of the combatants had overcome the other, and a\r\nfierce smile of triumph crossed his swarthy countenance as he raised his\r\ngleaming knife.\r\n\r\n\"Och, ye murtherer! would ye attimpt that same?\" cried Barney, catching\r\nthe man by the wrist and hurling him on his back. The other sprang up on\r\nbeing thus unexpectedly freed, and darted away, while the thwarted man\r\nuttered a yell of disappointment and sprang like a tiger at Barney's\r\nthroat. A blow, however, from the Irishman's fist, quietly delivered, and\r\nstraight between the eyes, stretched the Brazilian on the ground. At the\r\nsame moment a party of men, attracted by the cries, burst through the\r\nbushes and surrounded the successful champion. Seeing their countryman\r\napparently dead upon the ground, they rushed upon Barney in a body; but\r\nthe first who came within reach was floored in an instant, and the others\r\nwere checked in their career by the sudden appearance of the hermit and\r\nMartin Rattler. The noise of many voices, as of people hastening towards\r\nthem, was heard at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"We have no time to lose, do as I bid you,\" whispered the hermit.\r\nWhirling a heavy stick round his head the hermit shouted the single word\r\n\"Charge!\" and dashed forward.\r\n\r\nBarney and Martin obeyed. Three Brazilians went down like ninepins; the\r\nrest turned and fled precipitately.\r\n\r\n\"Now, run for life!\" cried the hermit, setting the example. Barney\r\nhesitated to follow what he deemed a cowardly flight, but the yells of\r\nthe natives returning in strong force decided the question. He and Martin\r\ntook to their heels with right good will, and in a few minutes the three\r\nfriends were far on the road which led to their night bivouac; while the\r\nvillagers, finding pursuit hopeless, returned to the village, and\r\ncontinued the wild orgies of their festa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOGITATIONS AND CANOEING ON THE AMAZON--BARNEY'S EXPLOIT WITH AN\r\nALLIGATOR--STUBBORN FACTS--REMARKABLE MODE OF SLEEPING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant, when the sun is bright, and the trees are green, and when\r\nflowering shrubs and sweet-smelling tropical trees scent the balmy\r\natmosphere at eventide, to lie extended at full length in a canoe, and\r\ndrop easily, silently, yet quickly, down the current of a noble river,\r\nunder the grateful shadow of overhanging foliage; and to look lazily up\r\nat the bright blue sky which appears in broken patches among the verdant\r\nleaves; or down at the river in which that bright sky and those green\r\nleaves are reflected; or aside at the mud-banks where greedy vultures are\r\nsearching for prey, and lazy alligators are basking in the sun; and to\r\nlisten, the while, to the innumerable cries and notes of monkeys,\r\ntoucans, parrots, orioles, bemtevi or fly-catchers, white-winged and blue\r\nchatterers, and all the myriads of birds and beasts that cause the\r\nforests of Brazil, above all other forests in the world probably, to\r\nresound with the gleeful songs of animated nature!\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to be thus situated, especially when a cool breeze blows\r\nthe mosquitoes and other insects off the water, and relieves you for a\r\ntime from their incessant attacks. Martin Rattler found it pleasant, as\r\nhe thus lay on his back with his diminutive pet marmoset monkey seated on\r\nhis breast quietly picking the kernel out of a nut. And Barney\r\nO'Flannagan found it pleasant, as he lay extended in the bow of the canoe\r\nwith his head leaning over the edge gazing abstractedly at his own\r\nreflected visage, while his hands trailed through the cool water, and his\r\nyoung dog--a shaggy indescribable beast with a bluff nose and a bushy\r\ntail--watched him intently, as a mother might watch an only child in a\r\ndangerous situation. And the old sun-dried, and storm-battered, and\r\ntime-shrivelled mulatto trader, in those canoe they were embarked and\r\nwhose servants they had become, found it pleasant, as he sat there\r\nperched in his little montaria, like an exceedingly ancient and overgrown\r\nmonkey, guiding it safely down the waters of the great river of the\r\nTocantins.\r\n\r\nSome months have passed since we last parted from our daring adventurers.\r\nDuring that period they had crossed an immense tract of country, and\r\nreached the head waters of one of the many streams that carry the surplus\r\nmoisture of central Brazil into the Amazon. Here they found an old\r\ntrader, a free mulatto, whose crew of Indians had deserted him,--a common\r\nthing in that country,--and who gladly accepted their services, agreeing\r\nto pay them a small wage. And here they sorrowfully, and with many\r\nexpressions of good-will, parted from their kind friend and entertainer\r\nthe hermit. His last gift to Martin was the wonderfully small marmoset\r\nmonkey before mentioned; and his parting souvenir to Barney was the\r\nbluff-nosed dog that watched over him with maternal care, and loved him\r\nnext to itself;--as well it might; for if everybody had been of the same\r\nspirit as Barney O'Flannagan, the Act for the prevention of cruelty to\r\nanimals would never have been passed in Britain.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiar and remarkable and altogether extraordinary monkey,\r\nthat tiny marmoset. There was a sort of romance connected with it, too;\r\nfor it had been the mother of an indescribably small infant-monkey,\r\nwhich was killed at the time of its mother's capture. It drank coffee,\r\ntoo, like--like a Frenchman; and would by no means retire to rest at\r\nnight until it had had its usual allowance. Then it would fold its\r\ndelicate little hands on its bosom, and close its eyes with an\r\nexpression of solemn grief, as if, having had its last earthly wish\r\ngratified, it now resigned itself to--sleep. Martin loved it deeply, but\r\nhis love was unrequited; for, strange to say, that small monkey lavished\r\nall its affection on Barney's shaggy dog. And the dog knew it, and was\r\nevidently proud of it, and made no objection whatever to the monkey\r\nsitting on his back, or his head, or his nose, or doing, in fact,\r\nwhatever it chose whenever it pleased. When in the canoe, the marmoset\r\nplayed with Grampus, as the dog was named; and when on shore it\r\ninvariably travelled on his back.\r\n\r\nMartin used to lie in the canoe half asleep and watch the little face of\r\nthe marmoset, until, by some unaccountable mental process, he came to\r\nthink of Aunt Dorothy Grumbit. Often did poor Martin dream of his dear\r\nold aunt, while sleeping under the shelter of these strange-leaved\r\ntropical trees and surrounded by the wild sounds of that distant land,\r\nuntil he dreamed himself back again in the old village. Then he would\r\nrush to the well-known school, and find all the boys there except Bob\r\nCroaker, who he felt certain must be away drowning the white kitten; and\r\noff he would go and catch him, sure enough, in the very act, and would\r\ngive him the old thrashing over again, with all the additional vigour\r\nacquired during his rambles abroad thrown into it. Then he would run home\r\nin eager haste, and find old Mrs. Grumbit hard at the one thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-ninth pair of worsted socks; and fat Mr. Arthur\r\nJollyboy sitting opposite to her, dressed in the old lady's bed-curtain\r\nchintz and high-crowned cap, with the white kitten in his arms and his\r\nspectacles on his chin, watching the process with intense interest, and\r\ncautioning her not to forget the \"hitch\" by any means; whereupon the\r\nkitten would fly up in his face, and Mr. Jollyboy would dash through the\r\nwindow with a loud howl, and Mrs. Grumbit's face would turn blue; and,\r\nuncoiling an enormous tail, she would bound shrieking after him in among\r\nthe trees and disappear! Martin usually wakened at this point, and found\r\nthe marmoset gazing in his face with an expression of sorrowful\r\nsolemnity, and the old sun-dried trader staring vacantly before him as he\r\nsteered his light craft down the broad stream of the Tocantins.\r\n\r\nThe trader could speak little more English than sufficed to enable him to\r\nsay \"yes\" and \"no\"; Barney could speak about as much Portuguese as\r\nenabled him to say \"no\" and \"yes\"; while Martin, by means of a slight\r\nsmattering of that language, which he had picked up by ear during the\r\nlast few months, mixed now and then with a word or two of Latin, and\r\nhelped out by a clever use of the language of signs, succeeded in\r\nbecoming the link of communication between the two.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks they continued to descend the river; paddling\r\nenergetically when the stream was sluggish, and resting comfortably when\r\nthe stream was strong, and sometimes dragging their canoe over rocks and\r\nsand-banks to avoid rapids--passing many villages and plantations of the\r\nnatives by the way--till at last they swept out upon the bosom of the\r\ngreat Amazon River.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing they saw upon entering it was an enormous alligator,\r\nfully eighteen feet long, sound asleep on a mud-bank.\r\n\r\n\"Och! put ashore, ye Naygur,\" cried Barney, seizing his pistol and rising\r\nup in the bow of the canoe. The old man complied quickly, for his spirit\r\nwas high and easily roused.\r\n\r\n\"Look out now, Martin, an' hould back the dog for fear he wakes him up,\"\r\nsaid Barney, in a hoarse whisper, as he stepped ashore and hastened\r\nstealthily towards the sleeping monster; catching up a handful of gravel\r\nas he went, and ramming it down the barrel of his pistol. It was a\r\nwonderful pistol that--an Irish one by birth, and absolutely incapable of\r\nbursting, else assuredly it would have gone, as its owner said, to\r\n\"smithereens\" long ago.\r\n\r\nBarney was not a good stalker. The alligator awoke and made for the water\r\nas fast as it could waddle. The Irishman rushed forward close up, as it\r\nplunged into the river, and discharged the compound of lead and stones\r\nright against the back of its head. He might as well have fired at the\r\nboiler of a steam-engine. The entire body of an alligator--back and\r\nbelly, head and tail--is so completely covered with thick hard scales,\r\nthat shot has no effect on it; and even a bullet cannot pierce its coat\r\nof mail, except in one or two vulnerable places. Nevertheless the shot\r\nhad been fired so close to it that the animal was stunned, and rolled\r\nover on its back in the water. Seeing this, the old trader rushed in up\r\nto his chin, and caught it by the tail; but at the same moment the\r\nmonster recovered, and, turning round, displayed its terrific rows of\r\nteeth. The old man uttered a dreadful roar, and struggled to the land as\r\nfast as he could; while the alligator, equally frightened, no doubt, gave\r\na magnificent flourish and splash with its tail, and dived to the bottom\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nThe travellers returned disgusted to their canoe, and resumed their\r\njourney up the Amazon in silence.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable places about an alligator are the soft parts under the\r\nthroat and the joints of the legs. This is well known to the jaguar, its\r\nmortal foe, which attacks it on land, and fastening on these soft parts,\r\nsoon succeeds in killing it; but should the alligator get the jaguar into\r\nits powerful jaws or catch it in the water, it is certain to come off the\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon, at its mouth, is more like a wide lake or arm of the sea than\r\na river. Mention has been already made of this noble stream in the\r\nHermit's Story; but it is worthy of more particular notice, for truly the\r\nAmazon is in many respects a wonderful river. It is the largest, though\r\nnot quite the longest, in the world. Taking its rise among the rocky\r\nsolitudes of the great mountain range of the Andes, it flows through\r\nnearly four thousand miles of the continent in an easterly direction,\r\ntrending northward towards its mouth, and entering the Atlantic Ocean on\r\nthe northern coast of South America, directly under the Equator. In its\r\ncourse it receives the waters of nearly all the great rivers of central\r\nSouth America, and thousands of smaller tributaries; so that when it\r\nreaches the ocean its volume of water is enormous. Some idea may be\r\nformed of its majestic size, from the fact that one of its\r\ntributaries--the Rio Negro--is fifteen hundred miles long, and varying in\r\nbreadth; being a mile wide not far from its mouth, while higher up it\r\nspreads out in some places into sheets of ten miles in width. The\r\nMadeira, another tributary, is also a river of the largest size. The\r\nAmazon is divided into two branches at its mouth by the island of Marajo,\r\nthe larger branch being ninety-six miles in width. About two thousand\r\nmiles from its mouth it is upwards of a mile wide. So great is the force\r\nof this flood of water, that it flows into the sea unmixed for nearly two\r\nhundred miles. The tide affects the river to a distance of about four\r\nhundred miles inland; and it is navigable from the sea for a distance of\r\nthree thousand miles inland.\r\n\r\nOn the north bank of the Amazon there are ranges of low hills, partly\r\nbare and partly covered with thickets. These hills vary from three\r\nhundred to a thousand feet high, and extend about two hundred miles\r\ninland. Beyond them the shores of the river are low and flat for more\r\nthan two thousand miles, till the spurs of the Andes are reached.\r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season the Amazon overflows all its banks, like the\r\nNile, for many hundreds of miles; during which season, as Martin Rattler\r\ntruly remarked, the natives may be appropriately called aquatic animals.\r\nTowns and villages, and plantations belonging to Brazilians, foreign\r\nsettlers, and half-civilized Indians, occur at intervals throughout the\r\nwhole course of the river; and a little trade in dye-woods, India-rubber,\r\nmedicinal drugs, Brazil nuts, coffee, &c., is done; but nothing to what\r\nmight and ought to be, and perhaps would be, were this splendid country\r\nin the hands of an enterprising people. But the Amazonians are lazy, and\r\nthe greater part of the resources of one of the richest countries in the\r\nworld is totally neglected.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah!\" said Barney, scratching his head and wrinkling his forehead\r\nintensely, as all that we have just written, and a great deal more, was\r\ntold to him by a Scotch settler whom he found superintending a cattle\r\nestate and a saw-mill on the banks of the Amazon--\"Faix, then, I'm jist\r\nas wise now as before ye begun to spake. I've no head for fagures\r\nwhatsumdiver; an' to tell me that the strame is ninety-six miles long and\r\nthree thousand miles broad at the mouth, and sich like calcerlations, is\r\no' no manner o' use, and jist goes in at wan ear an' out at the tother.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Scotch settler smiled and said, \"Well, then, if ye can\r\nremember that the Amazon is longer than all Europe is broad; that it\r\nopens up to the ocean not less than ten thousand miles of the interior\r\nof Brazil; and that, _comparatively_ speaking, no use is made of it\r\nwhatever, ye'll remember enough to think about with profit for some\r\ntime to come.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Barney did think about it, and ponder it, and revolve it in his mind,\r\nfor many days after, while he worked with Martin and the old trader at\r\nthe paddles of their montaria. They found the work of canoeing easier\r\nthan had been anticipated; for during the summer months the wind blows\r\nsteadily up the river, and they were enabled to hoist their mat-sail, and\r\nbowl along before it against the stream.\r\n\r\nHotels and inns there were none; for Brazil does not boast of many such\r\nconveniences, except in the chief towns; so they were obliged, in\r\ntravelling, to make use of an empty hut or shed, when they chanced to\r\nstop at a village, and to cook their own victuals. More frequently,\r\nhowever, they preferred to encamp in the woods--slinging their hammocks\r\nbetween the stems of the trees, and making a fire sometimes, to frighten\r\naway the jaguars, which, although seldom seen, were often heard at\r\nnight. They met large canoes and montarias occasionally coming down the\r\nstream, and saw them hauled up on shore, while their owners were cooking\r\ntheir breakfast in the woods; and once they came upon a solitary old\r\nIndian in a very curious position. They had entered a small stream in\r\norder to procure a few turtles' eggs, of which there were many in that\r\nplace buried in the sand-banks. On turning a point where the stream was\r\nnarrow and overhung with bushes and trees, they beheld a canoe tied to\r\nthe stem of a tree, and a hammock slung between two branches overhanging\r\nthe water. In this an old Indian lay extended, quite naked and fast\r\nasleep! The old fellow had grown weary with paddling his little canoe;\r\nand, finding the thicket along the river's banks so impenetrable that he\r\ncould not land, he slung his hammock over the water, and thus quietly\r\ntook his siesta. A flock of paroquets were screaming like little green\r\ndemons just above him, and several alligators gave him a passing glance\r\nas they floundered heavily in the water below; but the red man cared not\r\nfor such trifles. Almost involuntarily Martin began to hum the popular\r\nnursery rhyme--\r\n\r\n\"Hushy ba, baby, on the tree top;\r\nWhen the wind blows the cradle will rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, if he was only two foot lower, its thirty pair o' long teeth\r\nwould be stuck into his flank in wan minute, or I'm no prophet,\" said\r\nBarney, with a broad grin.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we give him a touch with the paddle in passing,\"\r\nsuggested Martin.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Barney started up, shaded his eyes with his hand, and,\r\nafter gazing for a few seconds at some object ahead of the canoe, he gave\r\nutterance to an exclamation of mingled surprise and consternation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ANACONDA'S DINNER--BARNEY GETS A FRIGHT--TURTLES' EGGS, OMELETS\r\nAND ALLIGATORS' TAILS--SENHOR ANTONIO'S PLANTATION--PREPARATIONS FOR A\r\nGREAT HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object which called forth the cry from our Irish friend, as related\r\nin the last chapter, was neither more nor less than a serpent of\r\ndimensions more enormous than Barney had ever before conceived of. It was\r\nupwards of sixteen feet long, and nearly as thick as a man's body; but\r\nabout the neck it was three times that size. This serpent was not,\r\nindeed, of the largest size. In South America they grow to nearly forty\r\nfeet in length. But it was fabulously gigantic in the eyes of our\r\nadventurers, who had never seen a serpent of any kind before.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Martin, eagerly, \"that must be an anaconda. Is it not?\" he\r\ninquired, turning to the old trader.\r\n\r\n\"Yees; it dead,\" was the short reply.\r\n\r\n\"So it is!\" cried Martin, who, on a nearer approach, observed that the\r\nbrute's body was cut in two just below the swelling at the neck.\r\n\r\n\"Now, did ye iver,\" cried Barney with increased surprise, \"see a sarpint\r\nwith a cow's horns growin' out at its mouth? Put ashore, old boy; we must\r\nhave a Vestigation o' this remarkable cratur.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe was soon aground, and in another minute the three travellers\r\nbusily engaged in turning over the carcass of the huge reptile, which\r\nthey found, to the amazement of Martin and Barney, had actually\r\nswallowed an ox whole, with the exception of the horns, which protruded\r\nfrom its mouth!\r\n\r\nAfter much questioning, in bad Portuguese, broken English, and remarkable\r\nsigns, Martin succeeded in drawing from the old trader the information\r\nthat anacondas of a large size are often in the habit of thus bolting\r\nhorses and oxen at a mouthful.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest exaggeration in this fact. Readers who are\r\ninclined to disbelieve it may refer to the works of Wallace and Gardner\r\non Brazil,--authorities which cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe reptile commences by patiently watching until an unfortunate animal\r\nstrays near to where it is lying, when it darts upon it, encircles it in\r\nits massive coils, and crushes it to death in an instant. Then it\r\nsqueezes the body and broken bones into a shapeless mass; after which it\r\nlicks the carcass all over, and covers it with a thick coating of saliva.\r\nHaving thus prepared its mouthful, the andaconda begins at the tail and\r\ngradually engulfs its victim, while its elastic jaws, and throat, and\r\nstomach are distended sufficiently to let it in; after which it lies in a\r\ntorpid state for many weeks, till the morsel is digested, when it is\r\nready for another meal. A horse goes down entire, but a cow sticks at the\r\nhorns, which the anaconda cannot swallow. They are allowed to protrude\r\nfrom its mouth until they decay and drop off.\r\n\r\nThey were at a loss at first to account for the creature being killed;\r\nbut the old trader suggested that it had been found in a torpid state,\r\nand slain by the Indian whom they had seen a short time ago enjoying his\r\nsiesta among the trees.\r\n\r\nHaving cut it open, in order to convince themselves beyond a doubt that\r\nit had swallowed an entire ox, Martin and the old trader re-embarked in\r\nthe canoe, and Barney was on the point of joining them when the bushes\r\nclose beside him were slightly stirred. Looking quickly round, he beheld\r\nthe head and the glittering eyes of another anaconda, apparently as large\r\nas the dead one, ready to dart upon him,--at least so he fancied; but he\r\ndid not wait to give it a chance. He fled instantly, and sprang towards\r\nthe boat, which he nearly upset as he leaped into it, and pushed out into\r\nthe stream. On reaching the middle of the river they looked back, but the\r\nanaconda was gone.\r\n\r\nSoon after this they came to a long sandbank, where the old trader said\r\nthey should find as many turtles' eggs as they wished for, although to\r\nBarney and Martin there seemed to be nothing on the bank at all. The\r\nfresh-water turtle of the Amazon, of which there are various species, is\r\none of the most useful of reptiles. Its flesh supplies abundance of good\r\nfood; and the eggs, besides being eaten, afford an excellent oil. The\r\nlargest species grow to the length of three feet, and have a flattish\r\noval shell of a dark colour, and quite smooth. Turtles lay their eggs\r\nabout the beginning of September, when the sand-banks begin to be\r\nuncovered. They scrape deep holes for them, and cover them carefully\r\nover, beating down the sand quite flat, and walking across the place\r\nseveral times, for the purpose of concealment. The eggs are then left to\r\nbe hatched by the heat of the sun. But, alas for the poor turtles! men\r\nare too clever for them. The eggs are collected by the natives in\r\nthousands, and, when oil is to be made of them, they are thrown into a\r\ncanoe, smashed and mixed up together, and left to stand, when the oil\r\nrises to the top, and is skimmed off and boiled. It keeps well, and is\r\nused both for lamps and cooking. Very few of the millions of eggs that\r\nare annually laid arrive at maturity.\r\n\r\nWhen the young turtles issue forth and run to the water, there are many\r\nenemies watching for them. Great alligators open their jaws and swallow\r\nthem by hundreds; jaguars come out of the forests and feed upon them;\r\neagles and buzzards and wood ibises are there, too, to claim their share\r\nof the feast; and, if they are fortunate enough to escape all these,\r\nthere are many large and ravenous fishes ready to seize them in the\r\nstream. It seems a marvel that any escape at all.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the old trader scraped up about a hundred eggs, to the\r\nimmense satisfaction of Martin and Barney. Then he took a bow and arrow\r\nfrom the bottom of the montaria and shot a large turtle in the water,\r\nwhile his companions kindled a fire, intending to dine. Only the nose of\r\nthe turtle was visible above water; but the old man was so expert in the\r\nuse of the bow, that he succeeded in transfixing the soft part of the\r\nanimal's neck with an arrow, although that part was under water. It was a\r\nlarge turtle, and very fat and heavy, so that it was with difficulty the\r\ntrader lifted it upon his old shoulders and bore it in triumph to the\r\nspot where his companions were busily engaged with their cooking\r\noperations. Turtles are frequently shot with the arrow by the natives;\r\nthey are also taken in great numbers with the hook and the net.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon ready. Barney concocted an immense and savoury omelet,\r\nand the old trader cooked an excellent turtle-steak, while Martin\r\nprepared a junk of jaguar meat, which he roasted, being curious to taste\r\nit, as he had been told that the Indians like it very much. It was pretty\r\ngood, but not equal to the turtle-eggs. The shell of the egg is leathery,\r\nand the yolk only is eaten. The Indians sometimes cat them raw, mixed\r\nwith farina. Cakes of farina, and excellent coffee, concluded their\r\nrepast; and Barney declared he had never had such a satisfactory \"blow\r\nout\" in his life; a sentiment with which Martin entirely agreed, and the\r\nold trader--if one might judge from the expression of his black\r\ncountenance--sympathized.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks our adventurers continued to ascend the Amazon, sometimes\r\nsailing before the wind; at other times, when it fell calm, pushing the\r\nmontaria up the current by means of long poles, or advancing more easily\r\nwith the paddles. Occasionally they halted for a day at the residence of\r\na wealthy cacao planter, in order to sell him some merchandise; for which\r\npurpose the canoe was unloaded, and the bales were opened out for his\r\ninspection. Most of these planters were Brazilians, a few were Yankee\r\nadventurers, and one or two were Scotch and English; but nearly all had\r\nmarried Brazilian ladies, who, with their daughters, proved good\r\ncustomers to the old trader. Some of these ladies were extremely \"purty\r\ncraturs,\" as Barney expressed it; but most of them were totally\r\nuneducated and very ignorant,--not knowing half so much as a child of\r\nseven or eight years old in more favoured lands. They were very fond of\r\nfine dresses and ornaments, of which considerable supplies were sent to\r\nthem from Europe and the United States, in exchange for the valuable\r\nproduce of their country. But, although their dresses were fine and\r\nthemselves elegant, their houses were generally very poor affairs--made\r\nof wood and thatched with broad leaves; and it was no uncommon thing to\r\nsee a lady, who seemed from her gay dress to be fitted for a\r\ndrawing-room, seated on an earthen floor. But there were all sorts of\r\nextremes in this strange land; for at the next place they came to,\r\nperhaps, they found a population of Negroes and Indians, and most of the\r\ngrown-up people were half naked, while all the children were entirely so.\r\n\r\nAt one plantation, where they resolved to spend a few days, the owner had\r\na pond which was much frequented by alligators. These he was in the habit\r\nof hunting periodically, for the sake of their fat, which he converted\r\ninto oil. At the time of their arrival, he was on the eve of starting on\r\na hunting expedition to the lake, which was about eight miles distant; so\r\nBarney and Martin determined to go and \"see the fun,\" as the latter said.\r\n\r\n\"Martin, lad,\" remarked Barney, as they followed the Negro slave who had\r\nbeen sent by Senhor Antonio, the planter, to conduct them to the lake,\r\nwhile he remained behind for an hour or two to examine the bales of the\r\nold trader; \"this is the quarest country, I believe, that iver was made;\r\nwhat with bastes, and varmints, and riptiles, and traes, and bushes, and\r\nrivers, it bates all creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it does, Barney; and it is a pity there are so few people in\r\nit who know how to make use of the things that are scattered all around\r\nthem. I'm inclined to think the hermit was right when he said that they\r\nwanted the Bible. They are too far sunk in laziness and idleness to be\r\nraised up by anything else. Just look,\" continued Martin, glancing round,\r\n\"what a wonderful place this is! It seems as if all the birds and curious\r\ntrees in Brazil had congregated here to meet us.\"\r\n\r\n\"So't does,\" said Barney, stopping to gaze on the scene through which\r\nthey were passing, with an expression of perplexity on his face, as if he\r\nfound the sight rather too much even for _his_ comprehension. Besides the\r\nparrots and scarlet and yellow macaws, and other strange-looking birds\r\nwhich we have elsewhere mentioned, there were long-tailed light-coloured\r\ncuckoos flying about from tree to tree, not calling like the cuckoo of\r\nEurope at all, but giving forth a sound like the creaking of a rusty\r\nhinge; there were hawks and buzzards of many different kinds, and\r\nred-breasted orioles in the bushes, and black vultures flying overhead,\r\nand Muscovy ducks sweeping past with whizzing wings, and flocks of the\r\ngreat wood-ibis sailing in the air on noiseless pinions, and hundreds of\r\nother birds that it would require an ornithologist to name; and myriads\r\nof insects,--especially ants and spiders, great and small,--that no\r\nentomologist could chronicle in a lifetime; all these were heard and seen\r\nat once; while of the animals that were heard, but not so often seen,\r\nthere were black and spotted jaguars, and pacas, and cotias, and\r\narmadillos, and deer, and many others, that would take _pages_ to\r\nenumerate and whole books to describe. But the noise was the great point.\r\nThat was the thing that took Martin and Barney quite aback, although it\r\nwas by no means new to them; but they could not get used to it. And no\r\nwonder! Ten thousand paroquets shrieking passionately, like a hundred\r\nknife-grinders at work, is no joke; especially when their melodies are\r\nmingled with the discordant cries of herons, and bitterns, and cranes,\r\nand the ceaseless buzz and hum of insects, like the bagpipe's drone, and\r\nthe dismal croaking of boat-bills and frogs,--one kind of which latter,\r\nby the way, doesn't croak at all, but _whistles_, ay, better than many a\r\nbird! The universal hubbub is tremendous! I tell you, reader, that you\r\n_don't_ understand it, and you _can't_ understand it; and if, after I had\r\nused the utmost excess of exaggerated language to convey a correct\r\nimpression of the reality, you were to imagine that you really _did_\r\nunderstand it, you would be very lamentably mistaken--that's all!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, you must not run away with the idea that the whole empire\r\nof Brazil is like this. There are dark thick solitudes in these vast\r\nforests, which are solemn and silent enough at times; and there are wide\r\ngrassy campos, and great sandy plains, where such sounds are absent. Yet\r\nthere are also thousands of such spots as I have just described, where\r\nall nature, in earth, air, and water, is instinct with noisy animal life.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours' walk, Martin and his companion reached the lake, and\r\nhere active preparations were making for the alligator hunt.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the only place ye have to spind the night in, Sambo?\" said\r\nBarney to their conductor, as he pointed to a wooden shed near which some\r\nfifteen or twenty Negro slaves were overhauling the fishing tackle.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, massa,\" answered the black, showing his white teeth; \"dat is de\r\nbottle of dis great city.\" Sambo could speak a little English, having\r\nwrought for several years on the coffee plantation of a Yankee settler.\r\nHe was a bit of a wag, too, much to the indignation of his grave master,\r\nthe Senhor Antonio, who abhorred jesting.\r\n\r\n\"Ye're too cliver, avic,\" said Barney, with a patronizing smile; \"take\r\ncare ye don't use up yer intellect too fast. It hurts the constitution in\r\nthe long-run.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Barney,\" cried Martin, who had gone ahead of his companions,\r\n\"come here, man, and just look at this pond. It's literally crammed full\r\nof alligators.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musha, but there's more alligators than wather, I belave!\"\r\nexclaimed Barney.\r\n\r\nThe pond was indeed swarming with these ferocious reptiles, which were\r\nconstantly thrusting their ugly snouts above the surface and then\r\ndisappearing with a flourish of their powerful tails. During the rainy\r\nseason this lake was much larger, and afforded ample room for its\r\ninhabitants; but at the height of the dry season, which it was at this\r\ntime, there was little water, and it was much overstocked. When\r\nalligators are thus put upon short allowance of water, they frequently\r\nbury themselves in the wet mud, and lie dormant for a long time, while\r\nthe water continues to retire and leaves them buried. But when the first\r\nshower of the rainy season falls, they burst open their tomb and drag\r\ntheir dry bodies to the lake or river on whose margin they went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two later the Senhor Antonio arrived; but as it was getting\r\ndark, nothing could be done until the following morning; so they slung\r\ntheir hammocks under the wooden shed on the margin of the lake, and, in\r\norder to save themselves as much as possible from the bites of the\r\ntormenting mosquitoes, went to sleep with their heads tied up in their\r\nhandkerchiefs, and their hands thrust into their breeches pockets! The\r\noccasional splash and snort of contending alligators, about twenty yards\r\noff, varied the monotony of the hours of darkness, while the frogs and\r\ncranes and jaguars sang their lullaby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAN ALLIGATOR HUNT--REMARKABLE EXPLOSIONS--THE RAINY SEASON USHERED IN BY\r\nAN AWFUL RESURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sunrise an expressive shout in Portuguese set the black slaves on\r\ntheir feet; and, after a hasty breakfast of alligator-tail and farina,\r\nthey commenced operations. Alligator-tail is by no means bad food, and\r\nafter the first mouthful,--taken with hesitation and swallowed with\r\ndifficulty,--Martin and Barney both pronounced it \"capital.\" Sambo, who\r\nhad cooked the delicate morsel, and stood watching them, smacked his lips\r\nand added, \"Fuss rate.\"\r\n\r\nAll being now ready for the hunt, a number of Negroes entered the\r\nwater, which was nowhere very deep, with long poles in their hands.\r\nThis appeared to Martin and Barney a very reckless and dangerous thing\r\nto do, as no doubt it was. Nevertheless accidents, they were told, very\r\nrarely happened.\r\n\r\nSambo, who was the overseer of the party, was the first to dash up to the\r\nmiddle in the water. \"Hi,\" exclaimed that dingy individual, making a\r\ntorrent of remarks in Portuguese, while he darted his long pole hither\r\nand thither; then, observing that Martin and Barney were gazing at him\r\nopen mouthed, he shouted, \"Look out, boys! here Jim comes! Take care, ole\r\nfeller, or he jump right down you' throat! hi-i-i!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a large alligator, having been rudely stirred up from his\r\nmuddy bed, floundered on the surface of the lake and Sambo instantly\r\ngave it a thump over the back and a blow under the ribs; which had the\r\neffect of driving it in the direction of the shore. Here a number of\r\nNegroes were ready for him; and the moment he came within reach, a coil\r\nof rope with a noose on the end of it, called a lasso, was adroitly\r\nthrown over the reptile's head: ten or twelve men then hauled the lasso\r\nand dragged it ashore amid shouts of triumph. This alligator was twenty\r\nfeet long, with an enormous misshapen head and fearful rows of teeth\r\nthat were terrible to behold. The monster did not submit to be captured,\r\nhowever, without a struggle; and the Negroes grew wild with excitement\r\nas they yelled and leaped madly about seeking to avoid its dangerous\r\njaws and the blows of its powerful tail. After some trouble, a second\r\nlasso was thrown over the tail, which was thus somewhat restrained in\r\nits movements; and Sambo, approaching cautiously with an axe, cut a deep\r\ngash just at the root of that formidable appendage, which rendered it\r\nharmless. \"Hi-i,\" shouted Sambo in triumph, as he sprang towards the\r\nanimal's head, and inflicted a similar gash in the neck; \"dare, you\r\nquite finish, ole feller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musha but that's thrue!\" ejaculated Barney, who stood staring at the\r\nwhole proceeding like one in a trance. \"Did ye iver git a bite, Sambo?\"\r\n\r\nBarney received no answer, for his sable friend was already up to his\r\nwaist in the water with five or six of his brethren, who were flourishing\r\ntheir long poles and driving the snorting alligators towards the shore,\r\nwhere their comrades, with lassos and harpoons, awaited them. Sometimes\r\nthey harpooned the alligators, and then, fastening lassos to their heads\r\nand tails, or to a hind leg, dragged them ashore; at other times they\r\nthrew the lasso over their heads at once, without taking the trouble to\r\nharpoon them. It was a terrible and a wonderful sight to witness the\r\nNegroes in the very midst of a shoal of these creatures, any one of which\r\ncould have taken a man into his jaws quite easily,--whence, once between\r\nthese long saw-like rows of teeth, no man could have escaped to tell how\r\nsharp they were. The creatures were so numerous that it was impossible to\r\nthrust a pole into the mud without stirring up one of them; but they were\r\nso terrified at the sudden attack and the shouts of the Negroes, that\r\nthey thought only of escape.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there arose a great cry. One of the lassos had snapt, and the\r\nalligator was floundering back into the water, when Sambo rushed in up to\r\nthe arm-pits, and caught the end of the rope. At the same moment two\r\nalligators made at the Negro with open jaws. It is probable that the\r\nanimals went in his direction by mere accident, and would have brushed\r\npast him in blind haste; but to Martin and Barney it seemed as if the\r\npoor man's fate were sealed, and they uttered a loud shout of horror as\r\nthey bounded simultaneously into the water, not knowing what to do, but\r\nbeing unable to restrain the impulse to spring to Sambo's aid.\r\nFortunately, however, one of the other Negroes was near Sambo. He sprang\r\nforward, and dealt the alligators two tremendous blows with his pole on\r\ntheir snouts, right and left, which turned them off. Then other Negroes\r\ncame up, laid hold of Sambo, who would not let go his hold and was being\r\ndragged into deep water, caught the end of the rope, and in ten minutes\r\nhauled their victim to the shore, when it was quickly despatched in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\nBy this time about a dozen alligators, varying from ten to twenty feet in\r\nlength, had been captured; and Barney at length became so bold that he\r\nrequested to be allowed to try his hand at throwing the lasso, the\r\ndexterous use of which by the Negroes had filled him with admiration. A\r\nloud burst of laughter greeted this proposal, and Sambo showed a set of\r\nteeth that might have made even the alligators envious, as he handed the\r\nIrishman a coil of line.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't miss, Barney,\" cried Martin, laughing heartily, as his comrade\r\nadvanced to the edge of the lake and watched his opportunity. \"Mind, your\r\ncredit as an expert hunter is at stake.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senhor Antonio stood close behind the Irishman, with his arms folded\r\nand a sarcastic smile on his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't send it down him's throat,\" yelled Sambo. \"Hi-i; dat's de vay to\r\nswing urn round. Stir um up, boys!--poke um up, villains, hi!\"\r\n\r\nThe Negroes in the water obeyed with frantic glee, and the terrified\r\nmonsters surged about in all directions, so that Barney found it almost\r\nimpossible to fix his attention on any particular individual. At length\r\nhe made up his mind, whirled the coil round his head, discharged the\r\nnoose, caught the Senhor Antonio round the neck, and jerked him violently\r\nto the ground!\r\n\r\nThere was a simultaneous pause of horror among the slaves; but it was too\r\nmuch for their risible faculties to withstand; with one accord they\r\nrushed howling into the water to conceal their laughter, and began to\r\nstir up and belabour the alligators with their poles, until the surface\r\nof the lake was a sheet of foam.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Senhor Antonio sprang to his feet and began to bluster\r\nconsiderably in Portuguese; but poor Barney seemed awfully crest-fallen,\r\narid the deep concern which wrinkled his face, and the genuine regret\r\nthat sounded in the tones of his voice, at length soothed the indignant\r\nBrazilian, who frowned gravely, and waving his hand, as if to signify\r\nthat Barney had his forgiveness, he stalked up to the shed, lighted a\r\ncigarito, and lay down in his hammock.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Martin, in an under-tone, \"you did it that time, Barney.\r\nI verily thought the old fellow was hanged. He became quite livid in\r\nthe face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! bad luck to the lasso, say I. May I niver more see the swate groves\r\no' Killarney if iver I meddle with wan again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi-i; you is fuss rate,\" said Sambo, as he and his comrades returned and\r\nbusied themselves in cutting up the dead alligators. \"You beat de Niggers\r\nall to not'ing. Not any of dis yere chiles eber lasso Sen'or Antonio yet;\r\nno, neber!\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the Negroes could effectually subdue their\r\nmerriment, but at length they succeeded, and applied themselves\r\nvigorously to the work of cutting out the fat. The alligators were all\r\ncut open,--a work of no small difficulty, owing to the hard scales\r\nwhich covered them as with coats of mail; then the fat, which\r\naccumulates in large quantities about the intestines, was cut out and\r\nmade up into packets in the skins of the smaller ones, which were taken\r\noff for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThese packets were afterwards carried to the Senhor's dwelling, and the\r\nfat melted down into oil, which served for burning in lamps quite as well\r\nas train oil. The flesh of a smaller species of alligator, some of which\r\nwere also taken, is considered excellent food; and, while the Negroes\r\nwere engaged in their work, Barney made himself useful by kindling a\r\nlarge fire and preparing a savoury dish for \"all hands,\" plentifully\r\nseasoned with salt and pepper, with which condiments the country is well\r\nsupplied, and of which the people are exceedingly fond.\r\n\r\nThere was also caught in this lake a large species of fish called\r\npirarucu, which, strangely enough, found it possible to exist in spite of\r\nalligators. They were splendid creatures, from five to six feet long, and\r\ncovered with large scales more than an inch in diameter, which were\r\nbeautifully marked and spotted with red. These fish were most delicately\r\nflavoured, and Barney exerted his talents to the utmost in order to do\r\nthem justice. Martin also did his best to prove himself a willing and\r\nefficient assistant, and cleaned and washed the pirarucu steaks and the\r\njunks of alligator-tail to admiration. In short, the exertions of the two\r\nstrangers in this way quite won the hearts of the Negroes, and after\r\ndinner the Senhor Antonio had quite recovered his good humour.\r\n\r\nWhile staying at this place Martin had an opportunity of seeing a great\r\nvariety of the curious fish with which the Amazon is stocked. These are\r\nso numerous that sometimes, when sailing up stream with a fair wind, they\r\nwere seen leaping all round the canoe in shoals, so that it was only\r\nnecessary to strike the water with the paddles in order to kill a few.\r\n\r\nThe peixe boi, or cow-fish, is one of the most curious of the inhabitants\r\nof the Amazon. It is about six feet long, and no less than five feet in\r\ncircumference at its thickest part. It is a perfectly smooth, and what we\r\nmay call _dumpy_ fish, of a leaden colour, with a semi-circular flat\r\ntail, and a large mouth with thick fleshy lips resembling those of a cow.\r\nThere are stiff bristles on the lips, and a few scattered hairs over the\r\nbody. It has two fins just behind the head; and below these, in the\r\nfemales, there are two breasts, from which good white milk flows when\r\npressure is applied. The cow-fish feeds on grass at the borders of rivers\r\nand lakes; and when suckling its young it carries it in its fins or\r\nflippers, and clasps the little one to its breast, just as a mother\r\nclasps her baby! It is harpooned and taken for the sake of its fat, from\r\nwhich oil is made. The flesh is also very good, resembling beef in\r\nquality, and it was much relished by Martin and Barney, who frequently\r\ndined on beef-steaks cut from this remarkable cow-fish.\r\n\r\nThere was also another fish which surprised our adventurers not a little\r\nthe first time they met with it. One evening Senhor Antonio had ordered\r\na net to be thrown into the river, being desirous of procuring a few\r\nfresh fish for the use of his establishment. The Indians and Negroes\r\nsoon after commenced dragging, and in a few minutes afterwards the sandy\r\nbank of the river was strewn with an immense variety of small fish,\r\namong which were a few of a larger kind. Martin and Barney became\r\nexcited as they saw them leaping and spluttering about, and ran in\r\namongst them to assist in gathering them into baskets. But scarcely had\r\nthe latter advanced a few steps when there was a loud report, as if a\r\npistol had gone off under his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" exclaimed the Irishman, leaping two feet into the air. On his\r\nreaching the ground again, a similar explosion occurred, and Barney\r\ndashed aside, overturning Martin in his haste. Martin's heel caught on a\r\nstone, and he fell flat on the ground, when instantly there was a report\r\nas if he had fallen upon and burst an inflated paper bag. The natives\r\nlaughed loud and long, while the unfortunate couple sprang up the bank,\r\nhalf inclined to think that an earthquake was about to take place. The\r\ncause of their fright was then pointed out. It was a species of small\r\nfish which has the power of inflating the fore part of its body into a\r\ncomplete ball, and which, when stamped upon, explodes with a loud noise.\r\nThere were great numbers of these scattered among the other fish, and\r\nalso large quantities of a little fish armed with long spines, which\r\ninflict a serious wound when trodden upon.\r\n\r\nAt this place adventures on a small scale crowded upon our travellers\r\nso thickly that Martin began to look upon sudden surprises as a\r\nnecessary of life, and Barney said that \"if it wint on any longer he\r\nfeared his eye-brows would get fixed near the top of his head, and\r\nniver more come down,\"\r\n\r\nOne evening, soon after their departure from the residence of Senhor\r\nAntonio, the old trader was sitting steering in the stern of his canoe,\r\nwhich was running up before a pretty stiff breeze. Martin was lying on\r\nhis back, as was his wont in such easy circumstances, amusing himself\r\nwith Marmoset; and Barney was reclining in the bow talking solemnly to\r\nGrampus; when suddenly the wind ceased, and it became a dead calm. The\r\ncurrent was so strong that they could scarcely paddle against it, so they\r\nresolved to go no further that night, and ran the canoe ashore on a low\r\npoint of mud, intending to encamp under the trees, no human habitation\r\nbeing near them. The mud bank was hard and dry, and cracked with the\r\nheat; for it was now the end of the dry season, and the river had long\r\nsince retired from it.\r\n\r\n\"Not a very comfortable place, Barney,\" said Martin, looking round, as he\r\nthrew down one of the bales which he had just carried up from the canoe.\r\n\"Hallo! there's a hut, I declare. Come, that's a comfort anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Martin pointed to one of the solitary and rudely constructed\r\nhuts or sheds which the natives of the banks of the Amazon sometimes\r\nerect during the dry season, and forsake when the river overflows its\r\nbanks. The hut was a very old one, and had evidently been inundated, for\r\nthe floor was a mass of dry, solid mud, and the palm-leaf roof was much\r\ndamaged. However, it was better than nothing, so they slung their\r\nhammocks under it, kindled a fire, and prepared supper. While they were\r\nbusy discussing this meal, a few dark and ominous clouds gathered in the\r\nsky, and the old trader, glancing uneasily about him, gave them to\r\nunderstand that he feared the rainy season was going to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Barney, lighting his pipe and stretching himself at\r\nfull length in his hammock, with a leg swinging to and fro over one side\r\nand his head leaning over the other, as was his wont when he felt\r\nparticularly comfortable in mind and body; \"Well then, avic, let it\r\nbegin. If we're sure to have it anyhow, the sooner it begins the better,\r\nto my thinkin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that,\" said Martin, who was seated on a large stone beside\r\nthe fire sipping a can of coffee, which he shared equally with Marmoset.\r\nThe monkey sat on his shoulder gazing anxiously into his face, with an\r\nexpression that seemed as if the creature were mentally exclaiming, \"Now\r\nme, now you; now me, now you,\" during the whole process. \"It would be\r\nbetter, I think, if we were in a more sheltered position before it\r\nbegins. Ha! there it comes though, in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nA smart shower began to fall as he spoke, and, percolating through the\r\nold roof, descended rather copiously on the mud floor. In a few minutes\r\nthere was a heaving of the ground under their feet!\r\n\r\n\"Ochone!\" cried Barney, taking his pipe out of his mouth and looking down\r\nwith a disturbed expression, \"there's an arthquake, I do belave.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds there was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" whispered Martin uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"It's dramin' I must have been,\" sighed Barney, resuming his pipe.\r\n\r\nAgain the ground heaved and cracked, and Martin and the old trader had\r\njust time to spring to their feet when the mud floor of the hut burst\r\nupwards and a huge dried-up-looking alligator crawled forth, as if from\r\nthe bowels of the earth! It glanced up at Barney; opened its tremendous\r\njaws, and made as if it would run at the terrified old trader; then,\r\nobserving the doorway, it waddled out, and, trundling down the bank,\r\nplunged into the river and disappeared.\r\n\r\nBarney could find no words to express his feelings, but continued to gaze\r\nwith an unbelieving expression down into the hole out of which the\r\nmonster had come, and in which it had buried itself many weeks before,\r\nwhen the whole country was covered with soft mud. At that time it had\r\nprobably regarded the shelter of the inundated hut as of some advantage,\r\nand had lain down to repose. The water retiring had left it there buried,\r\nand--as we have already mentioned in reference to alligators--when the\r\nfirst shower of the rainy season fell it was led by instinct to burst its\r\nearthy prison, and seek its native element.\r\n\r\nBefore Barney or his companions could recover from their surprise, they\r\nhad other and more urgent matters to think about. The dark clouds burst\r\noverhead, and the rain descended like a continued water-spout,--not in\r\ndrops but in heavy sheets and masses; the roof of the hut gave way in\r\nseveral places, driving them into a corner for shelter; the river began\r\nto rise rapidly, soon flooding the hut; and, when darkness overspread the\r\nland, they found themselves drenched to the skin and suspended in their\r\nhammocks over a running stream of water!\r\n\r\nThis event brought about an entire change in the aspect of nature, and\r\nwas the cause of a sad and momentous era in the adventures of Martin\r\nRattler and his companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE CAPO--INTERRUPTIONS--GRAMPUS AND MARMOSET--CANOEING IN THE WOODS--A\r\nNIGHT ON A FLOATING ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar and very striking feature in the character of the\r\ngreat Amazon, which affects the distinctive appearance of that river and\r\nmaterially alters the manners and customs of those who dwell beside it.\r\nThis peculiarity is the periodical overflow of its low banks; and the\r\npart thus overflowed is called the _Gapo_. It extends from a little above\r\nthe town of San-tarem up to the confines of Peru, a distance of about\r\nseventeen hundred miles; and varies in width from one to twenty miles: so\r\nthat the country when inundated assumes in many places the appearance of\r\nan extensive lake with forest trees growing out of the water; and\r\ntravellers may proceed many hundreds of miles in their canoes without\r\nonce entering the main stream of the river. At this time the natives\r\nbecome almost aquatic animals. Several tribes of Indians inhabit the\r\nGapo; such as the Purupurus, Muras; and others. They build small movable\r\nhuts on the sandy shores during the dry season, and on rafts in the wet\r\nThey subsist on turtle, cow-fish, and the other fish with which the river\r\nabounds, and live almost entirely in their canoes; while at night they\r\nfrequently sling their hammocks between the branches of trees and sleep\r\nsuspended over the deep water.\r\n\r\nSome of the animals found in the Gapo are peculiar to it, being attracted\r\nby the fruit-trees which are found growing only there. The Indians assert\r\nthat every tree that grows in the Gapo is distinct from all those that\r\ngrow in other districts; and when we consider that these trees are\r\nsubmerged for six months every year, till they are tall enough to rise\r\nabove the highest water-level, we may well believe their constitution is\r\nsomewhat different from those that are reared on ordinary ground. The\r\nIndians are wonderfully expert in finding their way among the trackless\r\nmazes of the Gapo, being guided by the broken twigs and scraped bark that\r\nindicate the route followed by previous travellers.\r\n\r\nOwing to this sudden commencement of the rainy season, the old trader\r\nresolved to return to a small village and there spend several months.\r\nMartin and Barney were much annoyed at this; for the former was impatient\r\nto penetrate further into the interior, and the latter had firmly made up\r\nhis mind to visit the diamond mines, about which he entertained the most\r\nextravagant notions. He did not, indeed, know in the least how to get to\r\nthese mines, nor even in which direction they lay; but he had a strong\r\nimpression that as long as he continued travelling he was approaching\r\ngradually nearer to them, and he had no doubt whatever that he would get\r\nto them at last. It was, therefore, with no small degree of impatience\r\nthat they awaited the pleasure of their sable master, who explained to\r\nthem that when the waters reached their height he would proceed.\r\n\r\nEverything comes to an end, even a long story. After many weeks had\r\npassed slowly by, their sojourn in this village came to an end too. It\r\nwas a dull place, very dull, and they had nothing to do; and the few\r\npoor people who lived there seemed to have very little or nothing to do.\r\nWe will, therefore, pass it over, and resume our narrative at the point\r\nwhen the old trader announced to Barney that the flood was at its height\r\nand they would now continue their journey. They embarked once more in\r\ntheir old canoe with their goods and chattels, not forgetting Marmoset\r\nand Grampus, whose friendship during their inactive life had become more\r\nclose than ever. This friendship was evidenced chiefly by the\r\nmatter-of-course way in which Grampus permitted the monkey to mount his\r\nback and ride about the village and through the woods, where dry places\r\ncould be found, as long as she pleased. Marmoset was fonder of riding\r\nthan walking, so that Grampus had enough to do; but he did not put\r\nhimself much about. He trotted, walked, galloped, and lay down, when,\r\nand where, and as often as he chose, without any reference to the small\r\nmonkey; and Marmoset held on through thick and thin, and nibbled nuts or\r\nwhatever else it picked up, utterly regardless of where it was going to\r\nor the pace at which it went. It was sharp, though, that small monkey,\r\nsharp as a needle, and had its little black eyes glancing on all sides;\r\nso that when Grampus dashed through underwood, and the branches\r\nthreatened to sweep it off, it ducked its head; or, lying flat down,\r\nshut its eyes and held on with all its teeth and four hands like a\r\nlimpet to a rock. Marmoset was not careful as to her attitude on\r\ndog-back. She sat with her face to the front or rear, just as her fancy\r\nor convenience dictated.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the village they travelled for many days and nights through\r\nthe Gapo. Although afloat on the waters of the Amazon, they never entered\r\nthe main river after the first few days, but wound their way, in a\r\ncreeping, serpentine sort of fashion, through small streams and lakes and\r\nswamps, from which the light was partially excluded by the thick foliage\r\nof the forest. It was a strange scene that illimitable watery waste, and\r\naroused new sensations in the breasts of our travellers. As Barney said,\r\nit made him \"feel quite solemn-like and eerie to travel through the woods\r\nby wather.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe was forced under branches and among dense bushes, till they got\r\ninto a part where the trees were loftier and a deep gloom prevailed. Here\r\nthe lowest branches were on a level with the surface of the water, and\r\nmany of them were putting forth beautiful flowers. On one occasion they\r\ncame to a grove of small palms, which were so deep in the water that the\r\nleaves were only a few feet above the surface. Indeed they were so low\r\nthat one of them caught Martin's straw-hat and swept it overboard.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! stop!\" cried Martin, interrupting the silence so suddenly\r\nthat Grampus sprang up with a growl, under the impression that game\r\nwas in view; and Marmoset scampered off behind a packing-box with an\r\nangry shriek.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong, lad?\" inquired Barney.\r\n\r\n\"Back water, quick! my hat's overboard, and there's an alligator going to\r\nsnap it up. Look alive, man!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the canoe was backed and the straw-hat rescued from its\r\nperilous position.\r\n\r\n\"It's an ill wind that blows nae guid, as the Scotch say,\" remarked\r\nBarney, rising in the canoe and reaching towards something among the\r\noverhanging branches. \"Here's wan o' them trees that old black-face calls\r\na maraja, with some splendid bunches o' fruit on it. Hould yer hat,\r\nMartin; there's more nor enough for supper anyhow,\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a rustling in the leaves told that monkeys were watching us,\r\nand Marmoset kept peeping up as if she half expected they might be\r\nrelations. But the moment the travellers caught sight of them they\r\nbounded away screaming.\r\n\r\nHaving gathered as much fruit as they required, they continued their\r\nvoyage, and presently emerged into the pleasant sunshine in a large\r\ngrassy lake, which was filled with lilies and beautiful water-plants,\r\nlittle yellow bladder-worts, with several other plants of which they knew\r\nnot the names; especially one with a thick swollen stalk, curious leaves,\r\nand bright blue flowers. This lake was soon passed, and they again\r\nentered into the gloomy forest, and paddled among the lofty trunks of the\r\ntrees, which rose like massive columns out of the deep water. There was\r\nenough of animal life there, however, to amuse and interest them. The\r\nconstant plash of falling fruit showed that birds were feeding overhead.\r\nSometimes a flock of parrots or bright blue chatterers swept from tree to\r\ntree, or atrogon swooped at a falling bunch of fruit and caught it ere it\r\nreached the water; while ungainly toucans plumped clumsily down upon the\r\nbranches, and sat, in striking contrast, beside the lovely pompadours,\r\nwith their claret-coloured plumage and delicate white wings.\r\n\r\nVieing with these birds in splendour were several large bright-yellow\r\nflowers of the creeping-plants, which twined round the trees. Some of\r\nthese plants had white, spotted, and purple blossoms; and there was one\r\nsplendid species, called by the natives the flor de Santa Anna--the\r\nflower of St. Ann--which emitted a delightful odour and was four inches\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nHaving traversed this part of the wood, they once more emerged upon the\r\nmain stream of the Amazon. It was covered with water-fowl. Large logs of\r\ntrees and numerous floating islands of grass were sailing down; and on\r\nthese sat hundreds of white gulls, demurely and comfortably voyaging to\r\nthe ocean; for the sea would be their final resting-place if they sat on\r\nthese logs and islands until they descended several hundreds of miles of\r\nthe great river.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Martin, after a long silence, during which the travellers\r\nhad been gazing on the watery waste as they paddled up stream--\"I wish\r\nthat we could fall in with solid land, where we might have something\r\ncooked. I'm desperately hungry now; but I don't see a spot of earth large\r\nenough for a mosquito to rest his foot on.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll jist have to take to farhina and wather,\" remarked Barney, laying\r\ndown his paddle and proceeding leisurely to light his pipe. \"It's a\r\nblissin' we've got baccy, any how. Tis mesilf that could niver git on\r\nwithout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you joy of it, Barney. It may fill your mouth, but it can't stop\r\nyour hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, boy, it's little ye know! Sure it stops the cravin's o' hunger, and\r\nkapes yer stumick from callin' out for iver, till ye fall in with\r\nsomethin' to ate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not seem to stop the mouth then, Barney, for you call out for\r\ngrub oftener than I do; and then you say that you couldn't get on without\r\nit; so you're a slave to it, old boy. I wouldn't be a slave to anything\r\nif I could help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin, lad, ye're gittin' deep. Take care now, or ye'll be in\r\nmettlefeesics soon. I say, ould black-face,\"--Barney was not on ceremony\r\nwith the old trader,--\"is there no land in thim parts at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not dis night,\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, then, we'll have to git up a tree and try to cook somethin' there;\r\nfor I'm not goin' to work on flour and wather. Hallo! hould on! There's\r\nan island, or the portrait o' wan! Port your helm, Naygur! hard aport!\r\nD'ye hear?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man heard, but, as usual, paid no attention to the Irishman's\r\nremarks; and the canoe would have passed straight on, had not Barney used\r\nhis bow-paddle so energetically that he managed to steer her, as he\r\nexpressed it, by the nose, and ran her against a mass of floating logs\r\nwhich had caught firmly in a thicket, and were so covered with grass and\r\nbroken twigs as to have very much the appearance of a real island. Here\r\nthey landed, so to speak, kindled a small fire, made some coffee, roasted\r\na few fish, baked several cakes, and were soon as happy and comfortable\r\nas hungry and wearied men usually are when they obtain rest and food.\r\n\r\n\"This is what I call jolly,\" remarked Barney.\r\n\r\n\"What's jolly?\" inquired Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Why _this_, to be sure,--grub to begin with, and a smoke and a\r\nconvanient snooze in prospect,\"\r\n\r\nThe hopes which Barney cherished, however, were destined to be blighted,\r\nat least in part. To the victuals he did ample justice; the pipe was\r\ndelightful, and in good working order; but when they lay down to repose,\r\nthey were attacked by swarms of stinging ants, which the heat of the fire\r\nhad driven out of the old logs. These and mosquitoes effectually banished\r\nsleep from their eye-lids, and caused them to reflect very seriously, and\r\nto state to each other more than once very impressively, that, with all\r\ntheir beauties and wonders, tropical lands had their disadvantages, and\r\nthere was no place like the \"ould country,\" after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SAD AND MOMENTOUS ERA REFERRED TO AT THE CLOSE OF THE CHAPTER\r\nPRECEDING THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nOne sultry evening, many weeks after our travellers had passed the\r\nuncomfortable night on the floating island in the Gapo, they came to a\r\nplace where the banks of the river rose boldly up in rugged rocks and\r\nhemmed in the waters of the Amazon, which were by this time somewhat\r\nabated. Here they put ashore, intending to kindle their fire and encamp\r\nfor the night, having been up and hard at work since daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe evening was calm and beautiful, and the troublesome insects not so\r\nnumerous as usual,--probably owing to the nature of the ground. One or\r\ntwo monkeys showed themselves for a moment, as if to enquire who was\r\nthere, and then ran away screaming; a porcupine also crossed their\r\npath, and several small bright snakes, of a harmless species, glided\r\nover the rocks, and sought refuge among the small bushes; but beyond\r\nthese there were few of the sights and sounds that were wont to greet\r\nthem in the forest.\r\n\r\n\"I think things look well to-night,\" remarked Martin as he threw down a\r\nbundle of sticks which he had gathered for the fire; \"we shall have a\r\ncomfortable snooze for certain, if the mosquitoes don't wake up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" replied Barney, striking a light with flint\r\nand steel and stooping to puff the smouldering spark into a flame. \"I've\r\nlarned by exparience that ye niver can be--puff--sure o' nothin' in\r\nthis--puff--remarkable country. Jist look at Darkey now,\" continued the\r\nIrishman, sitting down on a stone before the fire, which now began to\r\nkindle up, and stuffing the tobacco into his pipe with his little finger.\r\n\"There he is, a livin' Naygur, aliftin' of the provision-bag out o' the\r\ncanoe. Well, if he was all of a suddent to turn into Marmoset an' swaller\r\nhimself, an' then jump down the throat of Grampus, and the whole consarn,\r\ncanoe and all, to disappear, I don't think that I would be much\r\nsurprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you not, Barney? I suspect that I should be, a little, under the\r\ncircumstances; perhaps the old Nigger would be more so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a taste,\" continued Barney. \"Ye see, if that was to happen, I\r\nwould then know that it was all a drame. I've more than wance expected to\r\nwake up since I comed into furrin parts; the only thing that kapes me in\r\ndoubt about it is the baccy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Barney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, bekase it tastes so rael, good luck to it! that I can't git myself\r\nto think it's only a drame. Jist look, now,\" he continued, in the same\r\ntone of voice; \"if it wasn't a drame, how could I see sich a thing as\r\nthat standin' on the rock over there?\"\r\n\r\nMartin glanced towards the spot pointed out by his friend, and\r\nimmediately started up with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! Barney, that's no dream, I'll vouch for it. He's an Indian, and a\r\nvery ugly one too, I declare. I say, old fellow, do you know what sort of\r\nsavage that is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not know,\" answered the trader, glancing uneasily at the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"He might have the dacency to put on more close, anyhow,\" muttered\r\nBarney, as he gazed inquiringly at the savage.\r\n\r\nThe being who had thus appeared so suddenly before the travellers\r\nbelonged to one of the numerous tribes of Indians inhabiting the country\r\nnear the head-waters of some of the chief tributaries of the Amazon. He\r\nwas almost entirely naked, having merely a scanty covering on his loins;\r\nand carried a small quiver full of arrows at his back, and what appeared\r\nto be a long spear in his hand. His figure was strongly but not well\r\nformed; and his face, which was of a dark copper hue, was disfigured in a\r\nmost remarkable manner. A mass of coarse black hair formed the only\r\ncovering to his head. His cheeks were painted with curious marks of jet\r\nblack. But the most remarkable points about him were the huge pieces of\r\nwood which formed ornaments in his ears and under lip. They were round\r\nand flat like the wooden wheel of a toy-cart, about half an inch thick,\r\nand larger than an old-fashioned watch. These were fitted into enormous\r\nslits made in the ears and under lip, and the latter projected more than\r\ntwo inches from his mouth! Indeed, the cut that had been made to receive\r\nthis ornament was so large that the lip had been almost cut off\r\naltogether, and merely hung by each corner of his mouth! The aspect of\r\nthe man was very hideous, and it was by no means improved when, having\r\nrecovered from his surprise at unexpectedly encountering strangers, he\r\nopened his mouth to the full extent and uttered a savage yell.\r\n\r\nThe cry was answered immediately. In a few minutes a troop of upwards of\r\nthirty savages sprang from the woods, and, ascending the rock on which\r\ntheir comrade stood, gazed down on the travellers in surprise, and, by\r\ntheir movements, seemed to be making hasty preparations for an attack.\r\n\r\nBy this time Barney had recovered his self-possession, and became\r\nthoroughly convinced of the reality of the apparition before him. Drawing\r\nhis pistol hastily from his belt, he caught up a handful of gravel,\r\nwherewith he loaded it to the muzzle, ramming down the charge with a bit\r\nof mandioca-cake in lieu of a wad; then drawing his cutlass he handed it\r\nto Martin, exclaiming, \"Come, lad, we're in for it now. Take you the\r\ncutlass and Til try their skulls with the butt o' my pistol: it has done\r\ngood work before now in that way. If there's no more o' the blackguards\r\nin the background we'll bate them aisy.\"\r\n\r\nMartin instinctively grasped the cutlass, and there is no doubt that,\r\nunder the impulse of that remarkable quality, British valour, which\r\nutterly despises odds, they would have hurled themselves recklessly upon\r\nthe savages, when the horrified old trader threw himself on Barney's neck\r\nand implored him not to fight; for if he did they would all be killed,\r\nand if he only kept quiet the savages would perhaps do them no harm. At\r\nthe same moment about fifty additional Indians arrived upon the scene of\r\naction. This, and the old man's earnest entreaties, induced them to\r\nhesitate for an instant, and, before they could determine what to do,\r\nthey were surprised by some of the savages, who rushed upon them from\r\nbehind and took them prisoners. Barney struggled long and fiercely, but\r\nhe was at length overpowered by numbers. The pistol, which missed fire,\r\nwas wrenched from his grasp, and his hands were speedily bound behind his\r\nback. Martin was likewise disarmed and secured; not, however, before he\r\nmade a desperate slash at one of the savages, which narrowly missed his\r\nskull, and cut away his lip ornament.\r\n\r\nAs for the old trader, he made no resistance at all, but submitted\r\nquietly to his fate. The savages did not seem to think it worth their\r\nwhile to bind him. Grampus bounced and barked round the party savagely,\r\nbut did not attack; and Marmoset slept in the canoe in blissful ignorance\r\nof the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nThe hands of the two prisoners being firmly bound, they were allowed to\r\ndo as they pleased; so they sat down on a rock in gloomy silence, and\r\nwatched the naked savages as they rifled the canoe and danced joyfully\r\nround the treasures which their active knives and fingers soon exposed to\r\nview. The old trader took things philosophically. Knowing that it was\r\nabsolutely impossible to escape, he sat quietly down on a stone, rested\r\nhis chin on his hands, heaved one or two deep sighs, and thereafter\r\nseemed to be nothing more than an ebony statue.\r\n\r\nThe ransacking of the canoe and appropriating of its contents occupied\r\nthe savages but a short time, after which they packed everything up in\r\nsmall bundles, which they strapped upon their backs. Then, making signs\r\nto their prisoners to rise, they all marched away into the forest. Just\r\nas they were departing, Marmoset, observing that she was about to be left\r\nbehind, uttered a frantic cry, which brought Grampus gambolling to her\r\nside. With an active bound the monkey mounted its charger, and away they\r\nwent into the forest in the track of the band of savages.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of their march Martin and Barney were permitted to\r\nwalk beside each other, and they conversed in low, anxious tones.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said Barney, as they marched along surrounded by Indians,\r\n\"thim long poles the savages have got are not spears; I don't see no\r\npoint to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's more remarkable,\" added Martin, \"is that they all carry\r\nquivers full of arrows, but none of them have bows.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a raison for iverything,\" said Barney, pointing to one of the\r\nIndians in advance; \"that fellow explains the mystery.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the savage referred to lowered the pole, which seemed to be\r\nabout thirteen feet long, and pushing an arrow into a hole in the end of\r\nit, applied it to his mouth. In another moment the arrow flew through the\r\nair and grazed a bird that was sitting on a branch hard by.\r\n\r\n\"Tis a blow-pipe, and no mistake!\" cried Barney.\r\n\r\n\"And a poisoned arrow, I'm quite sure,\" added Martin; \"for it only\r\nruffled the bird's feathers, and see, it has fallen to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, then, but we'd have stood a bad chance in a fight, if thim's the\r\nwipons they use. Och, the dirty spalpeens! Martin, dear, we're done for.\r\nThere's no chance for us at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis impression seemed to take such deep hold of Barney's mind, that his\r\nusually reckless and half jesting disposition was completely subdued, and\r\nhe walked along in gloomy silence, while a feeling of deep dejection\r\nfilled the heart of his young companion.\r\n\r\nThe blow-pipe which these Indians use is an ingeniously contrived weapon.\r\nIt is made from a species of palm-tree. When an Indian wants one, he goes\r\ninto the woods and selects a tree with a long slender stem of less than\r\nan inch in diameter; he extracts the pith out of this, and then cuts\r\nanother stem, so much larger than the first that he can push the small\r\ntube into the bore of the large one,--thus the slight bend in one is\r\ncounteracted by the other, and a perfectly straight pipe is formed. The\r\nmouthpiece is afterwards neatly finished off. The arrows used are very\r\nshort, having a little ball of cotton at the end to fill the tube of the\r\nblow-pipe. The points are dipped in a peculiar poison, which has the\r\neffect of producing death when introduced into the blood by a mere\r\nscratch of the skin. The Indians can send these arrows an immense\r\ndistance, and with unerring aim, as Martin and Barney had many an\r\nopportunity of witnessing during their long and weary journey on foot to\r\nthe forest-home of the savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWORSE AND WORSE--EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO WRONG TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Indians did not maltreat the unfortunate strangers who had\r\nthus fallen into their hands, they made them proceed by forced marches\r\nthrough the wilderness; and as neither Barney nor Martin had been of late\r\nmuch used to long walks, they felt the journey very severely. The old\r\ntrader had been accustomed to everything wretched and unfortunate and\r\nuncomfortable from his childhood, so he plodded onward in silent\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThe country through which they passed became every day more and more\r\nrugged, until at length it assumed the character of a wild mountainous\r\ndistrict. Sometimes they wound their way in a zigzag manner up the\r\nmountain sides, by paths so narrow that they could scarcely find a\r\nfoot-hold. At other times they descended into narrow valleys where they\r\nsaw great numbers of wild animals of various kinds, some of which the\r\nIndians killed for food. After they reached the mountain district they\r\nloosed the hands of their prisoners, in order to enable them to climb\r\nmore easily. Indeed in many places they had to scramble so carefully that\r\nit would have been impossible for any one to climb with his hands tied\r\nbehind his back. But the Indians knew full well that they ran no risk of\r\nlosing their prisoners; for if they had attempted to escape, dozens of\r\ntheir number were on the watch, before, behind, and on either side, ready\r\nto dart away in pursuit. Moreover, Barney had a feeling of horror at the\r\nbare idea of the poisoned arrows, that effectually prevented him from\r\nmaking the smallest attempt at escape. With a cutlass or a heavy stick he\r\nwould have attacked the whole tribe single-handed, and have fought till\r\nhis brains were knocked out; but when he thought of the small arrows that\r\nwould pour upon him in hundreds if he made a dash for the woods, and the\r\ncertain death that would follow the slightest scratch, he discarded all\r\nidea of rebellion.\r\n\r\nOne of the animals killed by the Indians at this time was a black\r\njaguar,--a magnificent animal, and very fierce. He was discovered\r\ncrouching in a thicket backed by a precipice, from which he could only\r\nescape by charging through the ranks of his enemies. He did it nobly.\r\nWith a roar that rebounded from the face of the high cliff and echoed\r\nthrough the valley like a peal of thunder, he sprang out and rushed at\r\nthe savages in front, who scattered like chaff right and left. But at the\r\nsame instant fifty blow-pipes sent their poisoned shafts into his body,\r\nand, after a few convulsive bounds, the splendid monarch of the American\r\nforests fell dead on the ground. The black jaguar is a somewhat rare\r\nanimal, and is very seldom seen. This one was therefore hailed as a great\r\nprize, and the skin and claws were carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the same day the party came to a broad stream, over\r\nwhich they, or some other of the numerous tribes in the country, had\r\nconstructed a very simple and curious bridge. It was a single rope\r\nattached to an immense mass of rock on one side and to the stem of a\r\nlarge tree on the other. On this tight-rope was fastened a simple loop of\r\ncord, so constructed that it could encircle the waist of a man and at the\r\nsame time traverse from one end of the tight-rope to the other. Barney\r\nput on a comical frown when he came to this and saw the leader of the\r\nparty rest his weight in the loop, and, in clinging with hands and legs\r\nto the long rope, work himself slowly across.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! it's well for us, Martin, that we're used to goin' aloft,\" said\r\nhe, \"or that same bridge would try our narves a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would, Barney. I've seldom seen a more uncomfortable-looking\r\ncontrivance. If we lost our hold we should first be dashed to pieces on\r\nthe rocks, and then be drowned in the river.\"\r\n\r\nDifficult though the passage seemed, however? it was soon accomplished by\r\nthe active savages in safety. The only one of the party likely to be left\r\nbehind was Grampus; whom his master, after much entreaty in dumb-show,\r\nwas permitted to carry over by tying him firmly to his shoulders.\r\nMarmoset crossed over walking, like a tight-rope dancer, being quite _au\r\nfait_ at such work. Soon after they came to another curious bridge over a\r\nravine. It had been constructed by simply felling two tall trees on the\r\nedge of it in such a manner that they fell across. They were bound\r\ntogether with the supple vines that grew there in profusion. Nature had\r\nsoon covered the whole over with climbing plants and luxuriant verdure;\r\nand the bridge had become a broad and solid structure over which the\r\nwhole party marched with perfect ease. Several such bridges were crossed,\r\nand also a few of the rope kind, during the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter many weeks' constant travelling, the Indians came to a beautiful\r\nvalley one evening just about sunset, and began to make the usual\r\npreparations for encamping. The spot they selected was a singular one. It\r\nwas at the foot of a rocky gorge, up which might be seen trees and bushes\r\nmingled with jagged rocks and dark caverns, with a lofty sierra or\r\nmountain range in the background. In front was the beautiful valley which\r\nthey had just crossed. On a huge rock there grew a tree of considerable\r\nsize, the roots of which projected beyond the rock several yards, and\r\nthen, bending downwards, struck into the ground. Creeping plants had\r\ntwined thickly among the roots, and thus formed a sort of lattice-work\r\nwhich enclosed a large space of ground. In this natural arbour the chiefs\r\nof the Indians took up their quarters and kindled their fire in the\r\ncentre of it, while the main body of the party pitched their camp\r\noutside. The three prisoners were allotted a corner in the arbour; and,\r\nafter having supped, they spread their ponchos on a pile of ferns, and\r\nfound themselves very snug indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Martin,\" said Barney, gravely, as he smoked his pipe and patted the head\r\nof his dog, \"d'ye know I'm beginning to feel tired o' the company o' thim\r\nnaked rascals, and I've been revolvin' in my mind what we should do to\r\nescape. Moreover, I've corned to a conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's that?\" inquired Martin.\r\n\r\n\"That it's unposs'ble to escape at all, and I don't know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not a satisfactory conclusion, Barney. I, too, have been\r\ncogitating a good deal about these Indians, and it is my opinion that\r\nthey have been on a war expedition, for I've noticed that several of\r\nthem have been wounded; and, besides, I cannot fancy what else could\r\ntake them so far from home.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Martin, true. I wonder what they intind to do with us. They don't\r\nmean to kill us, anyhow; for if they did they would niver take the\r\ntrouble to bring us here. Ochone! me heart's beginnin' to go down\r\naltogether; for we are miles and miles away from anywrhere now, and I\r\ndon't know the direction o' no place whatsumdiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Barney, cheer up,\" said Martin with a smile; \"if they don't\r\nkill us that's all we need care about. I'm sure we shall manage to escape\r\nsomehow or other in the long-run.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they thus conversed the old trader spread his poncho over himself\r\nand was soon sound asleep; while the Indians, after finishing supper,\r\nheld an animated conversation. At times they seemed to be disputing, and\r\nspoke angrily and with violent gesticulations, glancing now and then at\r\nthe corner where their prisoners lay.\r\n\r\n\"It's my belafe,\" whispered Barney, \"that they're spakin' about us. I'm\r\nafeard they don't mean us any good. Och, but if I wance had my pistol and\r\nthe ould cutlass. Well, well, it's of no manner o' use frettin'.\r\nGood-night, Martin, good-night!\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman knocked the ashes out of his pipe, turned his face to the\r\nwall, and, heaving a deep sigh, speedily forgot his cares in sleep. The\r\nIndians also lay down, the camp-fires died slowly out; and the deep\r\nbreathing of the savages alone betokened the presence of man in that lone\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nBarney's forebodings proved to be only too well founded; for next\r\nmorning, instead of pursuing their way together, as usual, the savages\r\ndivided their forces into two separate bands, placing the Irishman and\r\nthe old trader in the midst of one, and Martin Rattler with the other.\r\n\r\n\"Surely they're niver goin' to part us, Martin,\" said Barney with a\r\ncare-worn expression on his honest countenance that indicated the anxious\r\nsuspicions in his heart.\r\n\r\n\"I fear it much,\" replied Martin with a startled look, as he watched the\r\nproceedings of the Indians. \"We must fight now, Barney, if we should die\r\nfor it. We _must_ not be separated.\"\r\n\r\nMartin spoke with intense fervour and gazed anxiously in the face of his\r\nfriend. A dark frown had gathered there. The sudden prospect of being\r\nforcibly torn from his young companion, whom he regarded with almost a\r\nmother's tenderness, stirred his enthusiastic and fiery temperament to\r\nits centre, and he gazed wildly about, as if for some weapon. But the\r\nsavages anticipated his intention; ere he could grasp any offensive\r\nweapon two of their number leaped upon him, and at the same moment\r\nMartin's arms were pinioned in a powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Och, ye murderin' blackguards!\" cried Barney, hitting out right and left\r\nand knocking down a savage at each blow. \"Now or niver! come on, ye\r\nkangaroos!\"\r\n\r\nA general rush was made upon the Irishman, who was fairly overturned by\r\nthe mass of men. Martin struggled fiercely to free himself, and would\r\nhave succeeded had not two powerful Indians hastened to the help of the\r\none who had first seized him. Despite his frantic efforts, he was dragged\r\nforcibly up the mountain gorge, the echoes of which rang with his cries\r\nas he shouted despairingly the name of his friend. Barney fought like a\r\ntiger; but he could make no impression on such numbers. Although at least\r\na dozen Indians lay around him bleeding and stunned by the savage blows\r\nof his fists,--a species of warfare which was entirely new to\r\nthem,--fresh savages crowded round. But they did not wish to kill him,\r\nand numerous though they were, they found it no easy matter to secure so\r\npowerful a man; and when Martin turned a last despairing glance towards\r\nthe camp, ere a turn in the path shut it out from view, the hammer-like\r\nfists of his comrade were still smashing down the naked creatures who\r\ndanced like monkeys round him, and the war-like shouts of his stentorian\r\nvoice reverberated among the cliffs and caverns of the mountain pass long\r\nafter he was hid from view.\r\n\r\nThus Martin and Barney were separated in the wild regions near the Sierra\r\ndos Parecis of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nMARTIN REFLECTS MUCH, AND FORMS A FIRM RESOLVE--THE INDIAN VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the mind has been overwhelmed by some sudden and terrible calamity,\r\nit is long ere it again recovers its wonted elasticity. An aching void\r\nseems to exist in the heart, and a dead weight appears to press upon the\r\nbrain, so that ordinary objects make but little impression, and the soul\r\nseems to turn inwards and brood drearily upon itself. The spirit of fun\r\narid frolick, that had filled Martin Rattler's heart ever since he landed\r\nin Brazil, was now so thoroughly and rudely crushed, that he felt as if\r\nit were utterly impossible that he should ever smile again.\r\n\r\nHe had no conception of the strength of his affection for the rough,\r\nhearty sailor, who had until now been the faithful and good-humoured\r\ncompanion of his wanderings. As Barney had himself said on a former\r\noccasion, his life up till this period had been a pleasant and exciting\r\ndream. But he was now awakened rudely to the terrible reality of his\r\nforlorn position; and the more he thought of it the more hopeless and\r\nterrible it appeared to be.\r\n\r\nHe knew not in what part of Brazil he was; he was being hurried\r\napparently deeper into these vast solitudes by savages who were certainly\r\nnot friendly, and of whose language he knew not a word; and worst of all,\r\nhe was separated perhaps for ever from the friend on whom, all\r\nunconsciously to himself, he had so long leaned for support in all their\r\ndifficulties and dangers. Even though he and Barney should succeed in\r\nescaping from the Indians, he felt--and his heart was overwhelmed at the\r\nthought--that in such a vast country there was not the shadow of a chance\r\nthat they should find each other. Under the deep depression produced by\r\nthese thoughts Martin wandered on wearily, as if in a dream--taking no\r\ninterest in anything that occurred by the way. At length, after several\r\ndays fatiguing journey over mountains and plains, they arrived at the\r\nIndian village.\r\n\r\nHere the warriors were received with the utmost joy by the wives and\r\nchildren whom they had left behind, and for a long time Martin was left\r\nalmost entirely to do as he pleased. A few days before, his bonds had\r\nbeen removed, and once or twice he thought of attempting to escape; but\r\nwhenever he wandered a little further than usual into the woods, he found\r\nthat he was watched and followed by a tall and powerful savage, whose\r\nduty it evidently was to see that the prisoner did not escape. The\r\nfearful idea now entered Martin's mind that he was reserved for torture,\r\nand perhaps a lingering death; for he had read that many savage nations\r\ntreated their prisoners in this cruel manner, for the gratification of\r\nthe women who had lost relations in the war. But as no violence was\r\noffered to him in the meantime, and he had as much farina and fruit to\r\neat as he could use, his mind gradually became relieved, and he\r\nendeavoured as much as possible to dismiss the terrible thought\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe Indian village occupied a lovely situation at the base of a gentle\r\nhill or rising ground, the summit of which was clothed with luxuriant\r\ntrees and shrubs. The huts were of various shapes and sizes, and very\r\nsimple in construction. They were built upon the bare ground; some were\r\nsupported by four corner posts, twelve or fifteen feet high, and from\r\nthirty to forty feet long, the walls being made of thin laths connected\r\nwith wicker-work and plastered with clay. The doors were made of\r\npalm-leaves, and the roofs were covered with the same material, or with\r\nmaize straw. Other huts were made almost entirely of palm-leaves and\r\ntent-shaped in form; and, while a few were enclosed by walls, the most of\r\nthe square ones had one or more sides entirely open. In the large huts\r\nseveral families dwelt together, and each family had a hearth and a\r\nportion of the floor allotted to it. The smoke from their fires was\r\nallowed to find its way out by the doors and chinks in the roofs, as no\r\nchimneys were constructed for its egress.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of each hut was very simple. It consisted of a few earthen\r\npots; baskets made of palm-leaves, which were filled with Spanish\r\npotatoes, maize, mandioca roots, and various kinds of wild fruits; one or\r\ntwo drinking vessels; the hollow trunk of a tree, used for pounding maize\r\nin; and several dishes which contained the colours used by the Indians in\r\npainting their naked bodies,--a custom which was very prevalent amongst\r\nthem. Besides these things, there were bows, arrows, spears, and\r\nblow-pipes in abundance; and hammocks hung from various posts, elevated\r\nabout a foot from the ground. These hammocks were made of cotton cords,\r\nand served the purpose of tables, chairs, and beds.\r\n\r\nThe ground in the immediate neighbourhood of the village was laid out in\r\npatches, in which were cultivated mandioca roots, maize, and other plants\r\nuseful for domestic purposes. In front of the village there was an\r\nextensive valley, through which a small river gurgled with a pleasant\r\nsound. It was hemmed in on all sides by wooded mountains, and was so\r\nbeautifully diversified by scattered clusters of palms, and irregular\r\npatches of undulating grassy plains all covered with a rich profusion of\r\ntropical flowers and climbing plants, that it seemed to Martin more like\r\na magnificent garden than the uncultivated forest,--only far more rich\r\nand lovely and picturesque than any artificial garden could possibly be.\r\nWhen the sun shone in full splendour on this valley--as it almost always\r\ndid--it seemed as if the whole landscape were on the point of bursting\r\ninto flames of red and blue, and green and gold; and when Martin sat\r\nunder the shade of a tamarind-tree and gazed long upon the enchanting\r\nscene, his memory often reverted to the Eden of which he used to read in\r\nthe Bible at home, and he used to wonder if it were possible that the sun\r\nand flowers and trees _could_ be more lovely in the time when Adam walked\r\nwith God in Paradise.\r\n\r\nMartin was young then, and he did not consider, although he afterwards\r\ncame to know, that it was not the beauty of natural objects, but the\r\npresence and favour of God and the absence of sin, that rendered the\r\nGarden of Eden a paradise. But these thoughts always carried him back to\r\ndear old Aunt Dorothy and the sweet village of Ashford; and the Brazilian\r\nparadise was not unfrequently obliterated in tears while he gazed, and\r\nturned into a vale of weeping. Ay, he would have given that magnificent\r\nvalley,--had it been his own,--ten times over, in exchange for one more\r\nglance at the loved faces and the green fields of home.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival at the Indian village Martin was given to\r\nunderstand, by signs, that he was to reside with a particular family, and\r\nwork every day in the maize and mandioca fields, besides doing a great\r\ndeal of the drudgery of the hut; so that he now knew he was regarded as a\r\nslave by the tribe into whose hands he had fallen. It is impossible to\r\nexpress the bitterness of his feelings at this discovery, and for many\r\nweeks he went about his work scarcely knowing what he did, and caring\r\nlittle, when the hot sun beat on him so fiercely that he could hardly\r\nstand, whether he lived or died. At length, however, he made up his mind\r\nfirmly to attempt his escape. He was sitting beneath the shade of his\r\nfavourite resort, the tamarind-tree, when he made this resolve. Longing\r\nthoughts of home had been strong upon him all that day, and desire for\r\nthe companionship of Barney had filled his heart to bursting; so that the\r\nsweet evening sunshine and the beautiful vale over which his eyes\r\nwandered, instead of affording him pleasure, seemed but to mock his\r\nmisery. It was a lesson that all must learn sooner or later, and one we\r\nwould do well to think upon before we learn it, that sunshine in the soul\r\nis not dependent on the sunshine of this world, and when once the clouds\r\ndescend, the brightest beams of all that earth contains cannot pierce\r\nthem,--God alone can touch these dark clouds with the finger of love and\r\nmercy, and say again, as He said of old, \"Let there be light.\" A firm\r\npurpose, formed with heart and will, is cheering and invigorating to a\r\ndepressed mind. No sooner did the firm determination to escape or die\r\nenter into Martin's heart, than he sprang from his seat, and, falling on\r\nhis knees, prayed to God, in the name of our Redeemer, for help and\r\nguidance. He had not the least idea of how he was to effect his escape,\r\nor of what he intended to do. All he knew was that he had _made up his\r\nmind_ to do so, _if God would help him_. And under the strength of that\r\nresolve he soon recovered much of his former cheerfulness of disposition,\r\nand did his work among the savages with a degree of energy that filled\r\nthem with surprise and respect. From that day forth he never ceased to\r\nrevolve in his mind every imaginable and unimaginable plan of escape, and\r\nto watch every event or circumstance, no matter how trifling, that seemed\r\nlikely to aid him in his purpose.\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was a very strong and active fellow, and that he had\r\nbecome remarkably expert in the use of the bow and the blow-pipe, the\r\nIndians now permitted Martin to accompany them frequently on their\r\nshort hunting expeditions, so that he had many opportunities of seeing\r\nmore of the wonderful animals and plants of the Brazilian forests, in\r\nthe studying of which he experienced great delight. Moreover, in the\r\ncourse of a few months he began to acquire a smattering of the Indian\r\nlanguage, and was not compelled to live in constant silence, as had\r\nbeen the case at first. But he carefully avoided the formation of any\r\nfriendships with the youths of the tribe, although many of them seemed\r\nto desire it, considering that his doing so might in some way or other\r\ninterfere with the execution of his great purpose. He was civil and\r\nkind to them all, however, though reserved; and, as time wore away, he\r\nenjoyed much more liberty than was the case at first. Still, however,\r\nhe was watched by the tall savage, who was a surly, silent fellow, and\r\nwould not be drawn into conversation. Indeed he did not walk with\r\nMartin, but followed him wherever he went, during his hours of leisure,\r\nat a distance of a few hundred yards, moving when his prisoner moved,\r\nand stopping when he halted, so that Martin at last began to regard him\r\nmore as a shadow than a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSAVAGE FEASTS AND ORNAMENTS--MARTIN GROWS DESPERATE, AND MAKES A BOLD\r\nATTEMPT TO ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting and feasting were the chief occupations of the men of the tribe\r\nwith whom Martin sojourned. One day Martin was told that a great feast\r\nwas to take place, and he was permitted to attend. Accordingly, a little\r\nbefore the appointed time he hastened to the large hut in and around\r\nwhich the festivities were to take place, in order to witness the\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that struck him was that there seemed to be no\r\npreparations making for eating; and on inquiry he was told that they did\r\nnot meet to eat, they met to drink and dance,--those who were hungry\r\nmight eat at home.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for drinking were made on an extensive scale by the\r\nwomen, a number of whom stood round a large caldron, preparing its\r\ncontents for use. These women wore very little clothing, and their\r\nbodies, besides being painted in a fantastic style, were also decorated\r\nwith flowers and feathers. Martin could not help feeling that, however\r\nabsurd the idea of painting the body was, it had at least the good effect\r\nof doing away to some extent with the idea of nakedness; for the curious\r\npatterns and devices gave to the Indians the appearance of being clothed\r\nin tights,--and, at any rate, he argued mentally, paint was better than\r\nnothing. Some of the flowers were artificially constructed out of\r\nbeetles' wings, shells, fish-scales, and feathers, and were exquisitely\r\nbeautiful as well as gorgeous.\r\n\r\nOne of the younger women struck Martin as being ultra-fashionable in her\r\npaint. Her black shining hair hung like a cloak over her reddish-brown\r\nshoulders, and various strange drawings and figures ornamented her face\r\nand breast. On each cheek she had a circle, and over that two strokes;\r\nunder the nose were four red spots; from the corners of her mouth to the\r\nmiddle of each cheek were two parallel lines, and below these several\r\nupright stripes; on various parts of her back and shoulders were\r\ncuriously entwined circles, and the form of a snake was depicted in\r\nvermilion down each arm. Unlike the others, she wore no ornament except a\r\nsimple necklace of monkeys' teeth. This beauty was particularly active in\r\nmanufacturing the intoxicating drink, which is prepared thus:--A quantity\r\nof maize was pounded in the hollow trunk of a tree and put into an\r\nearthen pot, where it was boiled in a large quantity of water. Then the\r\nwoman took the coarsely ground and boiled flour out of the water, chewed\r\nit in their mouths for a little, and put it into the pot again! By this\r\nmeans the decoction began to ferment and became intoxicating. It was a\r\nvery disgusting method, yet it is practised by many Indian tribes in\r\nAmerica; and, strange to say, also by some of the South Sea islanders,\r\nwho, of course, could not have learned it from these Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen this beverage was ready, the chief, a tall, broad-shouldered man,\r\nwhose painted costume and ornaments were most elaborate, stepped up to\r\nthe pot and began a strange series of incantations, which he accompanied\r\nby rattling a small wooden instrument in his hand; staring all the time\r\nat the earthen pot, as if he half expected it to run away; and dancing\r\nslowly round it, as if to prevent such a catastrophe from taking place.\r\nThe oftener the song was repeated the more solemn and earnest became the\r\nexpression of his face and the tones of his voice. The rest of the\r\nIndians, who were assembled to the number of several hundreds, stood\r\nmotionless round the pot, staring at him intently without speaking, and\r\nonly now and then, when the voice and actions of the chief became much\r\nexcited, they gave vent to a sympathetic howl.\r\n\r\nAfter this had gone on for some time, the chief seized a drinking-cup,\r\nor cuja, which he gravely dipped into the pot and took a sip. Then the\r\nshaking of the rattle and the monotonous song began again. The chief\r\nnext took a good pull at the cup and emptied it; after which he\r\npresented it to his companions, who helped themselves at pleasure; and\r\nthe dance and monotonous music became more furious and noisy the longer\r\nthe cup went round.\r\n\r\nWhen the cup had circulated pretty freely among them, their dances and\r\nmusic became more lively; but they were by no means attractive. After he\r\nhad watched them a short time, Martin left the festive scene with a\r\nfeeling of pity for the poor savages; and as he thought upon their low\r\nand debased condition he recalled to mind the remark of his old friend\r\nthe hermit,--\"They want the Bible in Brazil.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his frequent rambles in the neighbourhood of the Indian village,\r\nMartin discovered many beautiful and retired spots, to which he was in\r\nthe habit of going in the evenings after his daily labours were\r\naccomplished, accompanied, as usual, at a respectful distance, by his\r\nvigilant friend the tall savage. One of his favourite resting-places was\r\nat the foot of a banana-tree which grew on the brow of a stupendous cliff\r\nabout a mile distant from the hut in which he dwelt. From this spot he\r\nhad a commanding view of the noble valley and the distant mountains.\r\nThese mountains now seemed to the poor boy to be the ponderous gates of\r\nhis beautiful prison; for he had been told by one of his Indian friends\r\nthat on the other side of them were great campos and forests, beyond\r\nwhich dwelt many Portuguese, while still further on was a great lake\r\nwithout shores, which was the end of the world. This, Martin was\r\nconvinced, must be the Atlantic Ocean; for, upon inquiry, he found that\r\nmany months of travel must be undergone ere it could be reached.\r\nMoreover, he knew that it could not be the Pacific, because the sun rose\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nSauntering away to his favourite cliff, one fine evening towards sunset,\r\nhe seated himself beneath the banana-tree and gazed longingly at the\r\ndistant mountains, whose sharp summits glittered in the ruddy glow. He\r\nhad long racked his brain in order to devise some method of escape, but\r\nhitherto without success. Wherever he went the \"shadow\" followed him,\r\narmed with the deadly blow-pipe; and he knew that even if he did succeed\r\nin eluding his vigilance and escaping into the woods, hundreds of\r\nsavages would turn out and track him, with unerring certainty, to any\r\nhiding-place. Still the strength of his stern determination sustained\r\nhim; and, at each failure in his efforts to devise some means of\r\neffecting his purpose, he threw off regret with a deep sigh, and\r\nreturned to his labour with a firmer step, assured that he should\r\neventually succeed.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there on the edge of the precipice, he said, half aloud, \"What\r\nprevents me from darting suddenly on that fellow and knocking him down?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a question that might have been easily answered. No doubt he was\r\nphysically capable of coping with the man, for he had now been upwards of\r\na year in the wilderness, and was in his sixteenth year, besides being\r\nunusually tall and robust for his age. Indeed he looked more like a\r\nfull-grown man than a stripling; for hard, incessant toil had developed\r\nhis muscles and enlarged his frame, and his stirring life, combined\r\nlatterly with anxiety, had stamped a few of the lines of manhood on his\r\nsunburnt countenance. But, although he could have easily overcome the\r\nIndian, he knew that he would be instantly missed; and, from what he had\r\nseen of the powers of the savages in tracking wild animals to their dens\r\nin the mountains, he felt that he could not possibly elude them except by\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\nPerplexed and wearied with unavailing thought and anxiety, Martin pressed\r\nhis hands to his forehead and gazed down the perpendicular cliff, which\r\nwas elevated fully a hundred feet above the plain below. Suddenly he\r\nstarted and clasped his hands upon his eyes, as if to shut out some\r\nterrible object from his sight. Then, creeping cautiously towards the\r\nedge of the cliff, he gazed down, while an expression of stern resolution\r\nsettled upon his pale face.\r\n\r\nAnd well might Martin's cheek blanch, for he had hit upon a plan of\r\nescape which, to be successful, required that he should twice turn a\r\nbold, unflinching face on death. The precipice, as before mentioned, was\r\nfully a hundred feet high, and quite perpendicular. At the foot of it\r\nthere flowed a deep and pretty wide stream, which, just under the spot\r\nwhere Martin stood, collected in a deep black pool, where it rested for a\r\nmoment ere it rushed on its rapid course down the valley. Over the cliff\r\nand into that pool Martin made up his mind to plunge, and so give the\r\nimpression that he had fallen over and been drowned. The risk he ran in\r\ntaking such a tremendous leap was very great indeed, but that was only\r\nhalf the danger he must encounter.\r\n\r\nThe river was one of a remarkable kind, of which there are one or two\r\ninstances in South America. It flowed down the valley between high\r\nrocks, and, a few hundred yards below the pool, it ran straight against\r\nthe face of a precipice and there terminated to all appearance; but a\r\ngurgling vortex in the deep water at the base of the cliff, and the\r\ndisappearance of everything that entered it, showed that the stream\r\nfound a subterranean passage. There was no sign of its reappearance,\r\nhowever, in all the country round. In short, the river was lost in the\r\nbowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the pool to the cliff where the river was engulfed the water ran\r\nlike a mill-race, and there was no spot on either bank where any one\r\ncould land, or even grasp with his hand, except one. It was a narrow,\r\nsharp rock, that jutted out about two feet from the bank, quite close to\r\nthe vortex of the whirlpool. This rock was Martin's only hope. To miss it\r\nwould be certain destruction. But if he should gain a footing on it he\r\nknew that he could climb by a narrow fissure into a wild, cavernous spot,\r\nwhich it was exceedingly difficult to reach from any other point. A bend\r\nin the river concealed this rock and the vortex from the place whereon he\r\nstood, so that he hoped to be able to reach the point of escape before\r\nthe savage could descend the slope and gain the summit of the cliff from\r\nwhence it could be seen.\r\n\r\nOf all this Martin was well aware, for he had been often at the place\r\nbefore, and knew every inch of the ground. His chief difficulty would be\r\nto leap over the precipice in such a manner as to cause the Indian to\r\nbelieve he had fallen over accidentally. If he could accomplish this,\r\nthen he felt assured the savages would suppose he had been drowned, and\r\nso make no search for him at all. Fortunately the ground favoured this.\r\nAbout five feet below the edge of the precipice there was a projecting\r\nledge of rock nearly four feet broad and covered with shrubs. Upon this\r\nit was necessary to allow himself to fall. The expedient was a desperate\r\none, and he grew sick at heart as he glanced down the awful cliff, which\r\nseemed to him three times higher than it really was, as all heights do\r\nwhen seen from above.\r\n\r\nGlancing round, he observed his savage guardian gazing contemplatively at\r\nthe distant prospect. Martin's heart beat audibly as he rose and walked\r\nwith an affectation of carelessness to the edge of the cliff. As he gazed\r\ndown, a feeling of horror seized him; he gasped for breath, and almost\r\nfainted. Then the idea of perpetual slavery flashed across his mind, and\r\nthe thought of freedom and home nerved him: He clenched his hands,\r\nstaggered convulsively forward and fell, with a loud and genuine shriek\r\nof terror, upon the shrubs that covered the rocky ledge. Instantly he\r\narose, ground his teeth together, raised his eyes for one moment to\r\nheaven, and sprang into the air. For one instant he swept through empty\r\nspace; the next he was deep down in the waters of the dark pool, and when\r\nthe horrified Indian reached the edge of the precipice, he beheld his\r\nprisoner struggling on the surface for a moment, ere he was swept by the\r\nrapid stream round the point and out of view.\r\n\r\nBounding down the slope, the savage sped like a hunted antelope across\r\nthe intervening space between the two cliffs, and quickly gained the brow\r\nof the lower precipice, which he reached just in time to see Martin\r\nRattler's straw hat dance for a moment on the troubled waters of the\r\nvortex and disappear in the awful abyss. But Martin saw it, too, from the\r\ncleft in the frowning rock.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the surface after his leap he dashed the water from his eyes\r\nand looked with intense earnestness in the direction of the projecting\r\nrock towards which he was hurried. Down he came upon it with such speed\r\nthat he felt no power of man could resist. But there was a small eddy\r\njust below it, into which he was whirled as he stretched forth his hands\r\nand clutched the rock with the energy of despair. He was instantly torn\r\naway. But another small point projected two feet below it. This he\r\nseized. The water swung his feet to and fro as it gushed into the vortex,\r\nbut the eddy saved him. In a moment his breast was on the rock, then his\r\nfoot, and he sprang into the sheltering cleft just a moment before the\r\nIndian came in view of the scene of his supposed death.\r\n\r\nMartin flung himself with his face to the ground, and thought rather than\r\nuttered a heartfelt thanksgiving for his deliverance. The savage carried\r\nthe news of his death to his friends in the Indian village, and recounted\r\nwith deep solemnity the particulars of his awful fate to crowds of\r\nwondering,--in many cases sorrowing,--listeners; and for many a day after\r\nthat, the poor savages were wont to visit the terrible cliff and gaze\r\nwith awe on the mysterious vortex that had swallowed up, as they\r\nbelieved, the fair-haired boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE--ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS--FIGHT BETWEEN A JAGUAR AND AN\r\nALLIGATOR--MARTIN ENCOUNTERS STRANGE AND TERRIBLE CREATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom can be fully appreciated only by those who have been for a long\r\nperiod deprived of liberty. It is impossible to comprehend the feelings\r\nof joy that welled up in Martin's bosom as he clambered up the rugged\r\ncliffs among which he had found shelter, and looked round upon the\r\nbeautiful valley, now lying in the shadow of the mountain range behind\r\nwhich the sun had just set. He sat down on a rock, regardless of the wet\r\ncondition of his clothes, and pondered long and earnestly over his\r\nposition, which was still one of some danger; but a sensation of\r\nlight-hearted recklessness made the prospect before him seem very bright.\r\nHe soon made up his mind what to do. The weather was extremely warm, so\r\nthat after wringing the water out of his linen clothes he experienced\r\nlittle discomfort; but he felt that there would not only be discomfort\r\nbut no little danger in travelling in such a country without arms,\r\ncovering, or provisions. He therefore determined on the bold expedient of\r\nrevisiting the Indian village during the darkness of the night in order\r\nto procure what he required. He ran great risk of being retaken, but his\r\nnecessity was urgent, and he was aware that several families were absent\r\non a hunting expedition at that time whose huts were pretty certain to be\r\nunoccupied.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when two or three hours of the night had passed, he\r\nclambered with much difficulty down the precipitous rock and reached the\r\nlevel plain, over which he quickly ran, and soon reached the outskirts of\r\nthe village. The Indians were all asleep, and no sound disturbed the\r\nsolemn stillness of the night. Going stealthily towards a hut he peeped\r\nin at the open window, but could see and hear nothing. Just as he was\r\nabout to enter, however, a long-drawn breath proved that it was occupied.\r\nHe shrank hastily back into the deep shade of the bushes. In a few\r\nminutes he recovered from the agitation into which he had been thrown and\r\nadvanced cautiously towards another hut. This one seemed to be\r\nuntenanted, so he opened the palm-leaf door gently and entered. No time\r\nwas to be lost now. He found an empty sack or bag, into which he hastily\r\nthrew as much farina as he could carry without inconvenience. Besides\r\nthis, he appropriated a long knife; a small hatchet; a flint and steel,\r\nto enable him to make a fire; and a stout bow with a quiver full of\r\narrows. It was so dark that it was with difficulty he found these things.\r\nBut as he was on the point of leaving he observed a white object in a\r\ncorner. This turned out to be a light hammock, which he seized eagerly,\r\nand, rolling it up into a small bundle, placed it in the sack. He also\r\nsought for, and fortunately found, an old straw-hat, which he put on.\r\n\r\nMartin had now obtained all that he required, and was about to quit the\r\nhut when he became suddenly rooted to the spot with horror on observing\r\nthe dark countenance of an Indian gazing at him with distended eyeballs\r\nover the edge of a hammock. His eyes, unaccustomed to the darkness of the\r\nroom, had not at first observed that an Indian was sleeping there. He now\r\nfelt that he was lost. The savage evidently knew him. Dreadful thoughts\r\nflashed through his brain. He thought of the knife in his belt, and how\r\neasily he could despatch the Indian in a moment as he lay; but then the\r\nidea of imbruing his hands in human blood seemed so awful that he could\r\nnot bring himself to do it.\r\n\r\nAs he looked steadily at the savage he observed that his gaze was one of\r\nintense horror, and it suddenly occurred to him that the Indian supposed\r\nhe was a ghost! Acting upon this supposition, Martin advanced his face\r\nslowly towards that of the Indian, put on a dark frown, and stood for a\r\nfew seconds without uttering a word. The savage shrank back and shuddered\r\nfrom head to foot. Then, with a noiseless step, Martin retreated slowly\r\nbackward towards the door and passed out like a spectre--never for a\r\nmoment taking his eyes off those of the savage until he was lost in\r\ndarkness. On gaining the forest he fled with a beating heart to his\r\nformer retreat; but his fears were groundless, for the Indian firmly\r\nbelieved that Martin's spirit had visited his hut and carried away\r\nprovisions for his journey to the land of spirits.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to rest, Martin no sooner reached the scene of his\r\nadventurous leap than he fastened his bag firmly on his shoulders and\r\nstruck across the valley in the direction of the blue mountains that\r\nhemmed it in. Four or five hours' hard walking brought him to their base,\r\nand long before the rising sun shone down upon his recent home he was\r\nover the hills and far away, trudging onward with a weary foot, but with\r\na light heart, in what he believed to be the direction of the east coast\r\nof Brazil. He did not dare to rest until the rugged peaks of the mountain\r\nrange were between him and the savages; but, when he had left these far\r\nbehind him, he halted about mid-day to breakfast and repose by the margin\r\nof a delightfully cool mountain stream.\r\n\r\n\"I'm safe now!\" said Martin aloud, as he threw down his bundle beneath a\r\nspreading tree and commenced to prepare breakfast. \"O! my friend Barney,\r\nI wish that you were here to keep me company.\" The solitary youth looked\r\nround as if he half expected to see the rough visage and hear the\r\ngladsome voice of his friend; but no voice replied to his, and the only\r\nliving creature he saw was a large monkey, which peered inquisitively\r\nclown at him from among the branches of a neighbouring bush. This\r\nreminded him that he had left his pet Marmoset in the Indian village, and\r\na feeling of deep self-reproach filled his heart In the haste and anxiety\r\nof his flight he had totally forgotten his little friend. But regret was\r\nnow unavailing. Marmoset was lost to him for ever.\r\n\r\nHaving kindled a small fire, Martin kneaded a large quantity of farina in\r\nthe hollow of a smooth stone, and baked a number of flat cakes, which\r\nwere soon fired and spread out upon the ground. While thus engaged, a\r\nsnake of about six feet long and as thick as a man's arm glided past him.\r\nMartin started convulsively, for he had never seen one of the kind\r\nbefore, and he knew that the bite of some of the snakes is deadly.\r\nFortunately his axe was at hand. Grasping it quickly, he killed the\r\nreptile with a single blow. Two or three mandioca cakes, a few wild\r\nfruits, and a draught of water from the stream, formed the wanderer's\r\nsimple breakfast. After it was finished, he slung his hammock between two\r\ntrees, and jumping in, fell into a deep, untroubled slumber, in which he\r\ncontinued all that day and until daybreak the following morning.\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of a hearty breakfast, Martin took up his bundle and\r\nresumed his travels. That day he descended into the level and wooded\r\ncountry that succeeded the mountain range; and that night he was obliged\r\nto encamp in a swampy place near a stagnant lake in which several\r\nalligators were swimming, and where the mosquitoes were so numerous that\r\nhe found it absolutely impossible to sleep. At last, in despair, he\r\nsprang into the branches of the tree to which his hammock was slung and\r\nascended to the top. Here, to his satisfaction, he found that there were\r\nscarcely any mosquitoes, while a cool breeze fanned his fevered brow; so\r\nhe determined to spend the night in the tree.\r\n\r\nBy binding several branches together he formed a rude sort of couch, on\r\nwhich he lay down comfortably, placing his knife and bow beside him, and\r\nusing the hammock rolled up as a pillow. As the sun was setting, and\r\nwhile he leaned on his elbow looking down through the leaves with much\r\ninterest at the alligators that gambolled in the reedy lake, his\r\nattention was attracted to a slight rustling in the bushes near the foot\r\nof the tree. Looking down, he perceived a large jaguar gliding through\r\nthe underwood with cat-like stealth. Martin now observed that a huge\r\nalligator had crawled out of the lake, and was lying on the bank asleep a\r\nfew yards from the margin. When the jaguar reached the edge of the bushes\r\nit paused, and then, with one tremendous spring, seized the alligator by\r\nthe soft part beneath its tail. The huge monster struggled for a few\r\nseconds, endeavouring to reach the water, and then lay still, while the\r\njaguar worried and tore at its tough hide with savage fury. Martin was\r\nmuch surprised at the passive conduct of the alligator. That it could not\r\nturn its stiff body, so as to catch the jaguar in its jaws, did not,\r\nindeed, surprise him; but he wondered very much to see the great reptile\r\nsuffer pain so quietly. It seemed to be quite paralyzed. In a few minutes\r\nthe jaguar retired a short distance. Then the alligator made a rush for\r\nthe water; but the jaguar darted back and caught it again; and Martin now\r\nsaw that the jaguar was actually playing with the alligator as a cat\r\nplays with a mouse before she kills it! During one of the cessations of\r\nthe combat, if we may call it by that name, the alligator almost gained\r\nthe water, and in the short struggle that ensued both animals rolled down\r\nthe bank and fell into the lake. The tables were now turned. The jaguar\r\nmade for the shore; but before it could reach it the alligator wheeled\r\nround, opened its tremendous jaws and caught its enemy by the middle.\r\nThere was one loud splash in the water, as the alligator's powerful tail\r\ndashed it into foam; and one awful roar of agony, which was cut suddenly\r\nshort and stifled as the monster dived to the bottom with its prey; then\r\nall was silent as the grave, and a few ripples on the surface were all\r\nthat remained to tell of the battle that had been fought there.\r\n\r\nMartin remained motionless on the tree top, brooding over the fight which\r\nhe had just witnessed, until the deepening shadows warned him that it was\r\ntime to seek repose. Turning on his side he laid his head on his pillow,\r\nwhile a soft breeze swayed the tree gently to and fro and rocked him\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nThus, day after day, and week after week, did Martin Rattler wander alone\r\nthrough the great forests, sometimes pleasantly, and at other times with\r\nmore or less discomfort; subsisting on game which he shot with his\r\narrows, and on wild fruits. He met with many strange adventures by the\r\nway, which would fill numerous volumes were they to be written every one;\r\nbut we must pass over many of these in silence that we may recount those\r\nthat were most interesting.\r\n\r\nOne evening as he was walking through a very beautiful country, in which\r\nwere numerous small lakes and streams, he was suddenly arrested by a\r\ncrashing sound in the underwood, as if some large animal were coming\r\ntowards him; and he had barely time to fit an arrow to his bow when the\r\nbushes in front of him were thrust aside, and the most hideous monster\r\nthat he had ever seen appeared before his eyes. It was a tapir; but\r\nMartin had never heard of or seen such creatures before, although there\r\nare a good many in some parts of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe tapir is a very large animal,--about five or six feet long and three\r\nor four feet high. It is in appearance something between an elephant and\r\na hog. Its nose is very long, and extends into a short proboscis; but\r\nthere is no finger at the end of it like that of the elephant. Its\r\ncolour is a deep brownish black, its tough hide is covered with a thin\r\nsprinkling of strong hairs, and its mane is thick and bristly. So thick\r\nis its hide that a bullet can scarcely penetrate it; and it can crush\r\nits way through thickets and bushes, however dense, without receiving a\r\nscratch. Although a very terrific animal to look at, it is fortunately\r\nof a very peaceable and timid disposition, so that it flees from danger\r\nand is very quick in discovering the presence of an enemy. Sometimes it\r\nis attacked by the jaguar, which springs suddenly upon it and fastens\r\nits claws in its back; but the tapir's tough hide is not easily torn,\r\nand he gets rid of his enemy by bouncing into the tangled bushes and\r\nbursting through them, so that the jaguar is very soon _scraped_ off his\r\nback! The tapir lives as much in the water as on the land, and delights\r\nto wallow like a pig in muddy pools. It is, in fact, very similar in\r\nmany of its habits to the great hippopotamus of Africa, but is not quite\r\nso large. It feeds entirely on vegetables, buds, fruits, and the tender\r\nshoots of trees, and always at night. During the day time it sleeps. The\r\nIndians of Brazil are fond of its flesh, and they hunt it with spears\r\nand poisoned arrows.\r\n\r\nBut Martin knew nothing of all this, and fully expected that the dreadful\r\ncreature before him would attack and kill him; for, when he observed its\r\ncoarse, tough-looking hide, and thought of the slender arrows with which\r\nhe was armed, he felt that he had no chance, and there did not happen to\r\nbe a tree near him at the time up which he could climb.\r\n\r\nWith the energy of despair he let fly an arrow with all his force; but\r\nthe weak shaft glanced from the tapir's side without doing it the\r\nslightest damage. Then Martin turned to fly, but at the same moment the\r\ntapir did the same, to his great delight and surprise. It wheeled round\r\nwith a snort, and went off crashing through the stout underwood as if it\r\nhad been grass, leaving a broad track behind it.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he met with a formidable-looking but comparatively\r\nharmless animal, called the great ant-eater. This remarkable creature is\r\nabout six feet in length, with very short legs and very long strong\r\nclaws; a short curly tail, and a sharp snout, out of which it thrusts a\r\nlong narrow tongue. It can roll itself up like a hedgehog, and when in\r\nthis position might be easily mistaken for a bundle of coarse hay. It\r\nlives chiefly if not entirely upon ants.\r\n\r\nWhen Martin discovered the great ant-eater, it was about to begin its\r\nsupper; so he watched it. The plain was covered with ant-hills, somewhat\r\npillar-like in shape. At the foot of one of these the animal made an\r\nattack, tearing up earth and sticks with its enormously strong claws,\r\nuntil it made a large hole in the hard materials of which the hill was\r\ncomposed. Into this hole it thrust its long tongue, and immediately the\r\nants swarmed upon it. The creature let its tongue rest till it was\r\ncompletely covered over with thousands of ants, then it drew it into its\r\nmouth and engulfed them all!\r\n\r\nAs Martin had no reason in the world for attempting to shoot the great\r\nant-eater, and as he was, moreover, by no means sure that he could kill\r\nit if he were to try, he passed on quietly and left this curious animal\r\nto finish its supper in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMARTIN MEETS WITH FRIENDS AND VISITS THE DIAMOND MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, after Martin had spent many weeks in wandering alone through the\r\nforest, during the course of which he was sometimes tempted to despair of\r\nseeing the face of man again, he discovered a beaten track; at the sight\r\nof which his heart bounded with delight. It was a Saturday afternoon when\r\nhe made this discovery, and he spent the Sabbath-day in rest beside it.\r\nFor Martin had more than once called to remembrance the words which good\r\nAunt Dorothy used to hear him repeat out of the Bible \"Remember the\r\nSabbath-day, to keep it holy.\" He had many long, earnest, and serious\r\nmeditations in that silent forest, such as a youth would be very unlikely\r\nto have in almost any other circumstances, except, perhaps, on a\r\nsick-bed; and among other things he had been led to consider that if he\r\nmade no difference between Saturday and Sunday, he must certainly be\r\nbreaking that commandment; so he resolved thenceforth to rest on the\r\nSabbath-day; and he found much benefit, both to mind and body, from this\r\narrangement. During this particular Sabbath he rested beside the beaten\r\ntrack, and often did he walk up and down it a short way, wondering where\r\nit would lead him to; and several times he prayed that he might be led by\r\nit to the habitations of civilized men.\r\n\r\nNext day after breakfast he prepared to set out; but now he was much\r\nperplexed as to which way he ought to go, for the track did not run in\r\nthe direction in which he had been travelling, but at right angles to\r\nthat way. While he still hesitated the sound of voices struck on his ear,\r\nand he almost fainted with excitement; for, besides the hope that he\r\nmight now meet with friends, there was also the fear that those\r\napproaching might be enemies; and the sudden sound of the human voice,\r\nwhich he had not heard for so long, tended to create conflicting and\r\nalmost overwhelming feelings in his breast. Hiding quickly behind a tree,\r\nhe awaited the passing of the cavalcade; for the sounds of horses' hoofs\r\nwere now audible.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes a string of laden mules approached, and then six\r\nhorsemen appeared, whose bronzed olive complexions, straw-hats and\r\nponchos, betokened them Brazilians. As they passed, Martin hailed them in\r\nan unsteady voice. They pulled up suddenly and drew pistols from their\r\nholsters; but on seeing only a fair youth armed with a bow, they replaced\r\ntheir weapons, and with a look of surprise rode up and assailed him with\r\na volley of unintelligible Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\"Do any of you speak English?\" inquired Martin, advancing.\r\n\r\nOne of the horsemen replied, \"Yees, I spok one leet. Ver' smoll. Where\r\nyou be com?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have escaped from the Indians who live in the mountains far away over\r\nyonder. I have been wandering now for many weeks in the forest, and I\r\nwish to get to the sea-coast or to some town where I may get something to\r\ndo, that I may be enabled to return home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" said the horseman, gravely. \"You com vid us. Ve go vid goods to de\r\nDiamond Mines. Git vork dere, yees. Put you body on dat hoss.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Brazilian spoke he pointed to a spare horse, which was led, along\r\nwith several others, by a Negro. Thanking him for his politeness Martin\r\nseized the horse by the mane and vaulted into the saddle, if the rude\r\ncontrivance on its back might be so designated. The string of mules then\r\nmoved on, and Martin rode with a light heart beside this obliging\r\nstranger, conversing with much animation.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time he learned, through the medium of his own bad\r\nPortuguese and the Brazilian's worse English, that he was not more than a\r\nday's ride from one of the diamond mines of that province of Brazil which\r\nis named Minas Geraes; that he was still many leagues distant from the\r\nsea; and that he would be sure to get work at the mines if he wished it,\r\nfor the chief overseer, the Baron Fagoni, was an amiable man and very\r\nfond of the English,--but he could not speak their language at all, and\r\nrequired an interpreter. \"And,\" said the Brazilian, with a look of great\r\ndignity, \"I hab de honour for be de 'terpreter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Martin, \"then I am in good fortune, for I shall have a\r\nfriend at court.\"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter smiled slightly and bowed, after which they proceeded for\r\nsome time in silence.\r\n\r\nNext evening they arrived at the mines; and, after seeing to the comfort\r\nof his horse, and inquiring rather hastily as to the welfare of his\r\nfamily, the interpreter conducted Martin to the overseer's house in order\r\nto introduce him.\r\n\r\nThe Baron Fagoni stood smoking in the doorway of his dwelling as they\r\napproached; and the first impression that Martin received of him was\r\nanything but agreeable.\r\n\r\nHe was a large, powerful man, with an enormous red beard and moustache,\r\nand a sombrero-like hat that concealed nearly the whole of his face. He\r\nseemed an irritable man, too; for he jerked his arms about and stamped in\r\na violent manner as they drew near, and instead of waiting to receive\r\nthem, he entered the house hastily and shut the door in their faces!\r\n\r\n\"The Baron would do well to take lessons in civility,\" said Martin,\r\ncolouring, as he turned to the interpreter.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, he be a leet pecoolair, sometime! Nev'r mind. Ve vill go to him,\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the interpreter opened the door and entered the hall where\r\nthe overseer was seated at a desk writing as if in violent haste. Seeing\r\nthat he did not mean to take notice of them, the interpreter spoke to\r\nhim in Portuguese; but he was soon interrupted by a sharp reply, uttered\r\nin a harsh, grating voice, by the overseer, who did not look up or cease\r\nfrom his work.\r\n\r\nAgain the interpreter spoke as if in some surprise; but he was cut short\r\nby the overseer uttering, in a deep, stern voice, the single word \"Obey.\"\r\n\r\nWith a low bow the interpreter turned away, and taking Martin by the arm\r\nled him into an inner apartment, where, having securely fastened the\r\nwindow, he said to him, \"De Baron say you be von blackguard tief; go bout\r\ncontrie for steal diamonds. He make prisoner ov you. Adios.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the interpreter made his bow and retired, locking the door\r\nbehind him and leaving Martin standing in the middle of the room staring\r\nbefore him in speechless amazement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND MINES--MORE AND MORE ASTONISHING!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Martin Rattler was amazed at the treatment he experienced at the hands\r\nof his new acquaintances on arriving, he had occasion to be very much\r\nmore surprised at what occurred three hours after his incarceration.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark when he was locked up, and for upwards of two hours\r\nhe was left in total darkness. Moreover, he began to feel very hungry,\r\nhaving eaten nothing since mid-day. He was deeply engaged in devising\r\nplans for his escape when he was interrupted by the door being unlocked\r\nand a Negro slave entering with four magnificent candles, made of\r\nbeeswax, which he placed upon the table. Then he returned to the door,\r\nwhere another slave handed him a tray containing dishes, knives and\r\nforks, and, in short, all the requisites for laying out a supper-table.\r\nHaving spread a clean linen cloth on the board, he arranged covers for\r\ntwo, and going to the door placed his head to one side and regarded his\r\narrangements with much complacency and without paying the slightest\r\nattention to Martin, who pinched himself in order to make sure he was\r\nnot dreaming.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the second Negro returned with an enormous tray, on\r\nwhich were dishes of all sizes, from under whose covers came the most\r\nsavoury odours imaginable. Having placed these symmetrically on the\r\nboard, both slaves retired and relocked the door without saying a word.\r\n\r\nAt last it began to dawn on Martin's Imagination that the overseer must\r\nbe an eccentric individual, who found pleasure in taking his visitors by\r\nsurprise. But although this seemed a possible solution of the difficulty,\r\nhe did not feel satisfied with it. He could with difficulty resist the\r\ntemptation to attack the viands, however, and was beginning to think of\r\ndoing this, regardless of all consequences, when the door again opened\r\nand the Baron Fagoni entered, relocked the door, put the key in his\r\npocket, and, standing before his prisoner with folded arms, gazed at him\r\nintently from beneath his sombrero.\r\n\r\nMartin could not stand this. \"Sir,\" said he, starting up, \"if this is a\r\njoke you have carried it far enough; and if you really detain me here a\r\nprisoner, every feeling of honour ought to deter you from adding insult\r\nto injury.\"\r\n\r\nTo this sternly delivered speech the Baron made no reply, but, springing\r\nsuddenly upon Martin, he grasped him in his powerful arms and crushed him\r\nto his broad breast till he almost broke every bone in his body.\r\n\r\n\"Och! cushla, bliss yer young face! sure it's yersilf, an' no mistake!\r\nKape still, Martin dear. Let me look at ye, darlint! Ah! then, isn't it\r\nmy heart that's been broken for months an' months past about ye?\"\r\n\r\nReader, it would be utterly in vain for me to attempt to describe either\r\nthe words that flowed from the lips of Martin Rattler and Barney\r\nO'Flannagan on this happy occasion, or the feelings that filled their\r\nswelling hearts. The speechless amazement of Martin, the ejaculatory\r\nexclamations of the Baron Fagoni, the rapid questions and brief replies,\r\nare all totally indescribable. Suffice it to say that for full quarter of\r\nan hour they exclaimed, shouted, and danced round each other, without\r\ncoming to any satisfactory knowledge of how each had got to the same\r\nplace, except that Barney at last discovered that Martin had travelled\r\nthere by chance, and he had reached the mines by \"intuition.\" Having\r\nsettled this point, they sobered down a little.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Martin darlint,\" cried the Irishman, throwing aside his hat for the\r\nfirst time, and displaying his well-known jolly visage, of which the\r\nforehead, eyes, and nose alone survived the general inundation of red\r\nhair, \"ye'll be hungry, I've small doubt, so sit ye down, lad, to supper,\r\nand you'll tell me yer story as ye go along, and afther that I'll tell ye\r\nmine, while I smoke my pipe,--the ould cutty, boy, that has corned\r\nthrough fire and wather, sound as a bell and blacker than iver!\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron held up the well-known instrument of fumigation, as he spoke,\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\nSupper was superb. There were venison steaks, armadillo cutlets, tapir\r\nhash, iguana pie, and an immense variety of fruits and vegetables, that\r\nwould have served a dozen men, besides cakes and splendid coffee.\r\n\r\n\"You live well here, Barney--I beg pardon--Baron Fagoni,\" said\r\nMartin, during a pause in their meal; \"how in the world did you come\r\nby that name?\"\r\n\r\nBarney winked expressively. \"Ah, boy, I wish I may niver have a worse. Ye\r\nsee, when I first corned here, about four months ago, I found that the\r\nmine was owned by an Irish gintleman; an', like all the race, he's a\r\ntrump. He took to me at wance when he hear'd my voice, and then he took\r\nmore to me when he corned to know me character; and says he to me wan\r\nday, 'Barney,' says he, 'I'm gittin' tired o' this kind o' life now, and\r\nif ye'll agree to stop here as overseer, and sind me the proceeds o' the\r\nmine to Rio Janeiro, a great city on the sea-coast, an' the capital o'\r\nBrazil, I'll give ye a good share o' the profits. But,' says he, 'ye'll\r\nneed to pretind ye're a Roosian, or a Pole, or somethin' o' that kind;\r\nfor the fellows in thim parts are great rascals, and there's a few\r\nEnglishmen among them who would soon find out that ye're only a jack-tar\r\nbefore the mast, and would chate ye at no allowance; but if ye could\r\nspake no language under the sun but the gibberish pecooliar to the\r\nunbeknown provinces o' Siberia, ye could escape detection as far as yer\r\nvoice is consarned; and by lettin' yer beard grow as long as possible,\r\nand dressin' yersilf properly, ye might pass, and be as dignified as the\r\ngreat Mogul.'\r\n\r\n\"'Musha!' said I, 'but if I don't spake me own tongue I'll have to be\r\ndumb altogither.'\r\n\r\n\"'No fear,' says he; 'I'll tache ye enough Portuguese in a month or two\r\nto begin with, an' ye'll pick it up aisy after that.' And sure enough I\r\nbegan, tooth and nail, and, by hard workin', got on faster than I\r\nexpected; for I can spake as much o' the lingo now as tides me over\r\nneedcessities, and I understand most o' what's said to me. Anyhow, I\r\nginerally see what they're drivin' at.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then, you're actually in charge of the mine?\" said Martin, in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Jist so, boy; but I'm tired of it already; it's by no means so pleasant\r\nas I expected it would be; so I'm thinkin' o' lavin' it, and takin' to\r\nthe say again. I'm longin' dreadful to see the salt wather wance more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will the owner say, Barney: won't he have cause to complain of\r\nyour breaking your engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a bit, boy. He tould me, before we parted, that if I wanted to\r\nquit I was to hand over the consarn to the interpreter, who is an\r\nhonest fellow, I belave; so I'm jist goin' to pocket a di'mond or two,\r\nand ask lave to take them home wid me. I'll be off in a week, if all\r\ngoes well. An' now, Martin, fill yer glass; ye'll find the wine is not\r\nbad, after wan or two glasses; an' I'll tell ye about my adventures\r\nsince I saw ye last.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have not explained about your name,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Och! the fact is, that when I corned here I fortunately fell in with the\r\nowner first, and we spoke almost intirely in Irish, so nobody understood\r\nwhere I corned from; and the interpreter hear'd the master call me by my\r\nname; so he wint off and said to the people that a great Barono Flanagoni\r\nhad come, and was up at the house wid the master. But we corrected him\r\nafterward, and gave him to understand that I was the Baron Fagoni. I had\r\nsome trouble with the people at first, after the owner left; but I\r\npounded wan or two o' the biggest o' them, to such a extint that their\r\nown friends hardly knew them; an' iver since they've been mighty civil.\"\r\n\r\nHaving carefully filled the black pipe, and involved himself in his own\r\nfavourite atmosphere, the Baron Fagoni then proceeded to relate his\r\nadventures, and dilated upon them to such an extent that five or six\r\npipes were filled and finished ere the story came to a close. Martin also\r\nrelated his adventures; to which his companion listened with such\r\nbreathless attention and earnestness that his pipe was constantly\r\ngoing-out; and the two friends did not retire to rest till near daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the Baron's narrative was as follows:--\r\n\r\nAt the time that he had been so suddenly separated from his friend,\r\nBarney had overcome many of his opponents, but at length he was\r\noverpowered by numbers, and his arms were firmly bound; after which he\r\nwas roughly driven before them through the woods for several days, and\r\nwas at length taken to their village among the mountains. Here he\r\nremained a close prisoner for three weeks, shut up in a small hut and\r\nbound by a strong rope to a post. Food was taken to him by an old Indian\r\nwoman, who paid no attention at first to what he said to her, for the\r\ngood reason that she did not understand a word of English. The persuasive\r\neloquence of her prisoner's tones, however, or perhaps his brogue, seemed\r\nin the course of a few days to have made an impression on her; for she\r\ncondescended to smile at the unintelligible compliments which Barney\r\nlavished upon her in the hope of securing her good-will.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the Irishman's heart was torn with conflicting\r\nfeelings, and although, from the mere force of habit, he could jest with\r\nthe old woman when she paid her daily visits, there was no feeling of fun\r\nin his bosom, but, on the contrary, a deep and overwhelming sorrow, which\r\nshowed itself very evidently on his expressive face. He groaned aloud\r\nwhen he thought of Martin, whom he never expected again to see; and he\r\ndreaded every hour the approach of his savage captors, who, he fully\r\nexpected, retained him in order to put him to death.\r\n\r\nOne day, while he was sitting in a very disconsolate mood, the Indian\r\nwoman entered with his usual dinner--a plate of thick soup and a coarse\r\ncake. Barney smiled upon her as usual, and then letting his eyes fall on\r\nthe ground, sighed deeply,--for his heart was heavier than usual that\r\nday. As the woman was about to go, he looked earnestly and gravely in her\r\nface, and putting his large hand gently on her head, patted her grey\r\nhairs. This tender action seemed to affect the old woman more than usual.\r\nShe laid her hand on Barney's arm, and looked as if she wished to speak.\r\nThen turning suddenly from him, she drew a small knife from her girdle\r\nand dropped it on the ground, as if accidentally, while she left the hut\r\nand re-fastened the door. Barney's heart leaped. He seized the knife and\r\nconcealed it hastily in his bosom, and then ate his dinner with more than\r\nordinary zest; for now he possessed the means of cutting the strong rope\r\nthat bound him.\r\n\r\nHe waited with much impatience until night closed over the Indian\r\nvillage, and then cutting his bonds, he tore down the rude and rather\r\nfeeble fastenings of the door. In another instant he was dashing along at\r\nfull speed through the forest, without hat or coat, and with the knife\r\nclutched in his right hand! Presently he heard cries behind him, and\r\nredoubled his speed; for now he knew that the savages had discovered his\r\nescape and were in pursuit. But, although a good runner, Barney was no\r\nmatch for the lithe and naked Indians. They rapidly gained on him, and he\r\nwas about to turn at bay and fight for his life, when he observed water\r\ngleaming through the foliage on his left. Dashing down a glade he came to\r\nthe edge of a broad river with a rapid current. Into this he sprang\r\nrecklessly, intending to swim with the stream; but ere he lost his\r\nfooting he heard the low deep thunder of a cataract a short distance\r\nbelow! Drawing back in terror, he regained the bank, and waded up a\r\nconsiderable distance in the shallow water, so as to leave no trace of\r\nhis footsteps. Then he leaped upon a rock, and, catching hold of the\r\nlower branches of a large tree, drew himself up among the dense foliage,\r\njust as the yelling savages rushed with wild tumult to the water's edge.\r\nHere they paused, as if baffled. They spoke in rapid, vehement tones for\r\na few seconds, and then one party hastened down the banks of the stream\r\ntowards the fall, while another band searched the banks above.\r\n\r\nBarney's heart fell as he sat panting in the tree, for he knew that they\r\nwould soon discover him. But he soon resolved on a bold expedient.\r\nSlipping down from the tree, he ran deliberately back towards the\r\nvillage; and, as he drew near, he followed the regular beaten track that\r\nled towards it. On the way he encountered one or two savages hastening\r\nafter the pursuing party; but he leaped lightly into the bushes, and lay\r\nstill till they were past. Then he ran on, skirted round the village, and\r\npushed into the woods in an entirely opposite direction from the one in\r\nwhich he had first set out. Keeping by one of the numerous tracks that\r\nradiated from the village into the forest, he held on at top speed, until\r\nhis progress was suddenly arrested by a stream about twenty yards broad.\r\nIt was very deep, and he was about to plunge in, in order to swim across,\r\nwhen he observed a small montaria, or canoe, lying on the bank. This he\r\nlaunched quickly, and observing that the river took a bend a little\r\nfurther down, and appeared to proceed in the direction he wished to\r\npursue,--namely, away from the Indian village,--he paddled down the rapid\r\nstream as fast as he could. The current was very strong, so that his\r\nlittle bark flew down it like an arrow, and on more than one occasion\r\nnarrowly missed being dashed to pieces on the rocks which here and there\r\nrose above the stream.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours Barney came to a place where the stream took another\r\nbend to the left, and soon after the canoe swept out upon the broad river\r\ninto which he had at first so nearly plunged. He was a long way below the\r\nfall now, for its sound was inaudible; but it was no time to abate his\r\nexertions. The Indians might be still in pursuit; so he continued to\r\npaddle all that night, and did not take rest until daybreak. Then he\r\nslept for two hours, ate a few wild fruits, and continued his journey.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next day, to his great joy, he overtook a trading\r\ncanoe, which had been up another tributary of this river, and was\r\ndescending with part of a cargo of India-rubber shoes. None of the men,\r\nof whom there were four, could speak English; but they easily saw from\r\nthe Irishman's condition that he had escaped from enemies and was in\r\ndistress; so they took him on board, and were glad to avail themselves of\r\nhis services: for, as we have before mentioned, men are not easily\r\nprocured for voyaging in those parts of Brazil. Three weeks after this\r\nthey arrived at a small town, where the natives were busily engaged in\r\nthe manufacture of shoes, bottles, and other articles of India-rubber;\r\nand here Barney found employment for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe seringa, or India-rubber-tree, grows plentifully in some parts of\r\nBrazil, and many hundreds of the inhabitants are employed in the\r\nmanufacture of shoes. The India-rubber is the juice of the tree, and\r\nflows from it when an incision is made. This juice is poured into moulds\r\nand left to harden. It is of a yellowish colour naturally, and is\r\nblackened in the course of preparation. Barney did not stay long here.\r\nShoe-making, he declared, was not his calling by any means; so he seized\r\nthe first opportunity he had of joining a party of traders going into the\r\ninterior, in the direction of the diamond districts. The journey was long\r\nand varied. Sometimes by canoe and sometimes on the backs of mules and\r\nhorses, and many extraordinary adventures did he go through ere he\r\nreached the diamond mines. And when at length he did so, great was his\r\ndisappointment. Instead of the glittering caves which his vivid\r\nimagination had pictured, he found that there were no caves at all; that\r\nthe diamonds were found by washing in the muddy soil; and worst of all,\r\nthat when found they were dim and unpolished, so that they seemed no\r\nbetter than any other stone. However, he resolved to continue there for a\r\nshort time, in order to make a little money; but now that Martin had\r\narrived he thought that they could not do better than make their way to\r\nthe coast as fast as possible, and go to sea.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I have to regret,\" he said, at the conclusion of his\r\nnarrative, \"is that I left Grampus behind me. But arrah! I came off\r\nfrom the savages in such a hurry that I had no time at all to tell him\r\nI was goin'!\"\r\n\r\nHaving sat till daybreak, the two friends went to bed to dream of each\r\nother and of home.\r\n\r\nNext morning Barney took Martin to visit the diamond mines. On the way\r\nthey passed a band of Negro slaves who encircled a large fire, the\r\nweather being very cold. It was at that time about the end of July, which\r\nis one of the coldest months in the year. In this part of Brazil summer\r\nand winter are reversed,--the coldest months being May, June, and July;\r\nthe hottest, November, December, January, and February.\r\n\r\nMinas Geraes, the diamond district, is one of the richest provinces of\r\nBrazil. The inhabitants are almost entirely occupied in mining or in\r\nsupplying the miners with the necessaries of life. Diggers and\r\nshopkeepers are the two principal classes, and of these the latter are\r\nbest off; for their trade is steady and lucrative, while the success of\r\nthe miners is very uncertain. Frequently a large sum of money and much\r\ntime are expended in mining without any adequate result; but the\r\nmerchants always find a ready sale for their merchandise, and, as they\r\ntake diamonds and gold-dust in exchange, they generally realize large\r\nprofits and soon become rich. The poor miner is like the gambler. He\r\ndigs on in hope; sometimes finding barely enough to supply his\r\nwants,--at other times making a fortune suddenly; but never giving up\r\nin despair, because he knows that at every handful of earth he turns up\r\nhe may perhaps find a diamond worth hundreds, or, it may be, thousands\r\nof pounds.\r\n\r\nCidade Diamantina,--the City of Diamonds,--is the capital of the\r\nprovince. It is a large city, with many fine churches and buildings; and\r\nthe whole population, consisting of more than 6000 souls, are engaged,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in mining. Every one who owns a few slaves\r\nemploys them in washing the earth for gold and diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe mine of which Barney had so unexpectedly become overseer, was a small\r\none, in a remote part of the district, situated among the mountains, and\r\nfar distant from the City of Diamonds. There were only a few huts, rudely\r\nbuilt and roofed with palm leaves, besides a larger building, or cottage,\r\nin which the Baron Fagoni resided.\r\n\r\n\"Tis a strange life they lead here,\" said Barney, as he led Martin down a\r\ngorge of the mountains towards a small spot of level ground on which the\r\nslaves were at work; \"a strange life, and by no means a pleasant wan; for\r\nthe feedin' is none o' the best and the work very sevare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Barney, if I may judge from last night's supper, the feeding seems\r\nto be excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrue, boy, the Baron Fagoni feeds well, bekase he's the cock o' the\r\nroost; but the poor Naygurs are not overly well fed, and the critters are\r\nup to their knees in wather all day, washing di'monds; so they suffer\r\nmuch from rheumatiz and colds. Och, but it's murther entirely; an' I've\r\nmore than wance felt inclined to fill their pockets with di'monds and set\r\nthem all free! Jist look, now, there they are, hard at it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they arrived at the mine. The ground in the vicinity was all\r\ncut up and dug out to a considerable depth, and a dozen Negroes were\r\nstanding under a shed washing the earth, while others were engaged in the\r\nholes excavating the material. While Martin watched them his friend\r\nexplained the process.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of soil through which it is necessary to cut before\r\nreaching the diamond deposit are, first, about twenty feet of reddish\r\nsandy soil; then about eight feet of a tough yellowish clay; beneath this\r\nlies a layer of coarse reddish sand, below which is the peculiar soil in\r\nwhich diamonds are found. It is called by the miners the _cascalho_, and\r\nconsists of loose gravel, the pebbles of which are rounded and polished,\r\nhaving at some previous era been subject to the action of running water.\r\nThe bed varies in thickness from one to four feet, and the pebbles are of\r\nvarious kinds; but when there are many of a species called\r\n_Esmerilopreto_, the cascalho is considered to be rich in diamonds.\r\n\r\nTaking Martin round to the back of the shed, Barney showed him a row of\r\ntroughs, about three feet square, close to the edge of a pond of water.\r\nThese troughs are called _bacos_. In front of each stood a Negro slave up\r\nto his knees in water. Each had a wooden plate, with which he dashed\r\nwater upon the rough cascalho as it was thrown into the trough by another\r\nslave. By this means, and by stirring it with a small hoe, the earth and\r\nsand are washed away. Two overseers were closely watching the process;\r\nfor it is during this part of the operation that the largest diamonds are\r\nfound. These overseers were seated on elevated seats, each being armed\r\nwith a long leathern whip, to keep a sharp look out, for the slaves are\r\nexpert thieves.\r\n\r\nAfter the cascalho had been thus purified it was carefully removed to the\r\nshed to be finally washed.\r\n\r\nHere seven slaves were seated on the side of a small canal, about four\r\nfeet broad, with their legs in the water nearly up to their knees. The\r\ncanal is called the _lavadeira_. Each man had a small wooden platter,\r\ninto which another slave, who stood behind him, put a shovelful of\r\npurified cascalho. The _bateia_, or platter, was then filled with water\r\nand washed with the utmost care several times, being closely examined\r\nafter each washing, and the diamonds picked out. Sometimes many platefuls\r\nwere examined but nothing found; at other times several diamonds were\r\nfound in one plate. While Martin was looking on with much curiosity and\r\ninterest, one of the slaves uttered an exclamation and held up a minute\r\nstone between his finger and thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! good luck to ye, lad!\" said Barney, advancing and taking the diamond\r\nwhich had been discovered. \"See here, Martin; there's the thing, lad,\r\nthat sparkles on the brow o' beauty, and gives the Naygurs rheumatiz--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to mention their usefulness in providing the great Baron Fagoni with\r\na livelihood,\" added Martin, with a smile.\r\n\r\nBarney laughed, and going up to the place where the two overseers were\r\nseated, dropped the precious gem into a plate of water placed between\r\nthem for the purpose of receiving the diamonds as they were found.\r\n\r\n\"They git fifteen or twinty a day sometimes,\" said Barney, as they\r\nretraced their steps to the cottage; \"and I've hear'd o' them getting\r\nstones worth many thousands o' pounds; but the biggest they iver found\r\nsince I corned here was not worth more than four hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you do with them, Barney, when they are found?\"\r\ninquired Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Sind them to Rio Janeiro, lad, where my employer sells them. I don't\r\nknow how much he makes a year by it; but the thing must pay, for he's\r\nvery liberal with his cash, and niver forgits to pay wages. There's\r\nalways a lot o' gould-dust found in the bottom o' the bateia after each\r\nwashing, and that is carefully collected and sold. But, arrah! I wouldn't\r\ngive wan snifter o' the say-breezes for all the di'monds in Brazil!\"\r\n\r\nAs Barney said this he entered his cottage and flung down his hat with\r\nthe air of a man who was resolved to stand it no longer.\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you wash on your own account?\" cried Martin. \"What\r\nsay you; shall we begin together? We may make our fortune the first\r\nweek, perhaps!\"\r\n\r\nBarney shook his head. \"No, no, boy; I've no faith in my luck with the\r\ndi'monds or gould. Nevertheless I have hear'd o' men makin' an awful\r\nheap o' money that way; partiklarly wan man that made his fortin with\r\nwan stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was that lucky dog?\" asked Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye see, it happened this way: There's a custom hereaway that\r\nslaves are allowed to work on Sundays and holidays on their own account;\r\nbut when the mines was a government consarn this was not allowed, and the\r\nslaves were the most awful thieves livin', and often made off with some\r\no' the largest diamonds. Well, there was a man named Juiz de Paz, who\r\nowned a small shop, and used to go down now and then to Rio de Janeiro to\r\nbuy goods. Wan evenin' he returned from wan o' his long journeys, and,\r\nbeing rather tired, wint to bed. He was jist goin' off into a comfortable\r\ndoze when there came a terrible bumpin' at the door.\r\n\r\n\"'Hallo!' cried Juiz, growlin' angrily in the Portugee tongue; 'what\r\nd'ye want?'\r\n\r\n\"There was no answer but another bumpin' at the door. So up he jumps,\r\nand, takin' down a big blunderbuss that hung over his bed, opened the\r\ndoor, an' seized a Naygur be the hair o' the head!\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, massa! oh, massa! let him go! Got di'mond for to sell!'\r\n\r\n\"On hearin' this, Juiz let go, and found that the slave had come to\r\noffer for sale a large di'mond, which weighed about two penny-weights\r\nand a third.\r\n\r\n\"'What d'ye ask for it?' said Juiz, with sparklin' eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Six hundred mil-reis,' answered the Naygur.\r\n\r\n\"This was about equal to £180 Stirling. Without more words about it, he\r\npaid down the money; and the slave went away. Juiz lost his sleep that\r\nnight. He went and tould the neighbours he had forgot a piece of\r\nimportant business in Rio and must go back at wance. So back he went, and\r\nstayed some time in the city, tryin' to git his di'mond safely sold; for\r\nit was such a big wan that he feared the government fellows might hear\r\no't; in which case he would have got tin years transportation to Angola\r\non the coast of Africa. At last, however, he got rid of it for 20,000\r\nmil-reis, which is about £6000. It was all paid to him in hard dollars;\r\nand he nearly went out o' his wits for joy. But he was brought down a peg\r\nnixt day, when he found that the same di'mond was sold for nearly twice\r\nas much as he had got for it. Howiver, he had made a pretty considerable\r\nfortin; an' he's now the richest di'mond and gould merchant in the\r\ndistrict.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lucky fellow certainly,\" said Martin. \"But I must say I have no taste\r\nfor such chance work; so I'm quite ready to start for the sea-coast\r\nwhenever it suits the Baron Fagoni's convenience.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking they were attracted by voices outside the\r\ncottage, which sounded as if in altercation. In another minute the door\r\nburst open, and a man entered hurriedly, followed by the interpreter.\r\n\r\n\"Your overseer is impertinent!\" exclaimed the man, who was a tall swarthy\r\nBrazilian. \"I wish to buy a horse or a good mule, and he won't let me\r\nhave one. I am not a beggar; I offer to pay.\"\r\n\r\nThe man spoke in Portuguese, and Barney replied in the same language.\r\n\r\n\"You can have a horse _if you pay for it_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian replied by throwing a heavy bag of dollars on the table.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Barney, turning to his interpreter and conversing with\r\nhim in an under-tone. \"Give him what he requires.\" So saying he bowed the\r\nBrazilian out of the room, and returned to the enjoyment of his black\r\npipe, which had been interrupted by the incident.\r\n\r\n\"That man seems in a hurry,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\n\"So he is. My interpreter tells me that he is quite like one o' the\r\nblackguards that sometimes go about the mines doin' mischief, and he's in\r\nhot haste to be away. I should not wonder if the spalpeen has been\r\nstealin' gould or di'monds and wants to escape. But of course I've\r\nnothin' to do with that, unless I was sure of it; and I've a horse or two\r\nto sell, and he has money to pay for it; so he's welcome. He says he is\r\nmakin' straight for the say-coast; and with your lave, Martin, my boy,\r\nyou and I will be doin' that same in a week after this, and say good-bye\r\nto the di'mond mines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nNEW SCENES AND PLEASANT TRAVELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new and agreeable sensation is a pleasant thing. It was on as bright an\r\nevening as ever shone upon Brazil, and in as fair a scene as one could\r\nwish to behold, that Martin Rattler and his friend Barney experienced a\r\nnew sensation. On the wide campos, on the flower-bedecked and grassy\r\nplains, they each bestrode a fiery charger; and, in the exultation of\r\nhealth, and strength, and liberty, they swept over the green sward of the\r\nundulating campos, as light as the soft wind that fanned their bronzed\r\ncheeks, as gay in heart as the buzzing insects that hovered above the\r\nbrilliant flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is best of all!\" shouted Martin, turning his sparkling eyes to\r\nBarney, as he reined up his steed after a gallop that caused its nostril\r\nto expand and its eye to dilate. \"There's nothing like it! A fiery\r\ncharger that can't and _won't_ tire, and a glorious sweep of plain like\r\nthat! Huzza! whoop!\" And loosening the rein of his willing horse, away he\r\nwent again in a wild headlong career.\r\n\r\n\"Och, boy, pull up, or ye'll kill the baste!\" cried Barney, who thundered\r\nalong at Martin's side enjoying to the full the spring of his powerful\r\nhorse; for Barney had spent the last farthing of his salary on the two\r\nbest steeds the country could produce, being determined, as he said, to\r\nmake the last overland voyage on clipper-built animals, which, he wisely\r\nconcluded, would fetch a good price at the end of the journey. \"Pull up!\r\nd'ye hear? They can't stand goin' at that pace. Back yer topsails, ye\r\nyoung rascal, or I'll board ye in a jiffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I pull up with _that_ before me?\" cried Martin, pointing to\r\na wide ditch or gully that lay in front of them. \"I must go over\r\nthat first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go over that!\" cried Barney, endeavouring to rein in his horse, and\r\nlooking with an anxious expression at the chasm. \"It's all very well for\r\nyou to talk o' goin' over, ye feather; but fifteen stun--Ah, then,\r\n_won't_ ye stop? Bad luck to him, he's got the bit in his teeth! Oh then,\r\nye ugly baste, go, and my blissin' go with ye!\"\r\n\r\nThe leap was inevitable. Martin went over like a deer. Barney shut his\r\neyes, seized the pommel of the saddle, and went at it like a\r\nthunder-bolt In the excitement of the moment he shouted, in a stentorian\r\nvoice, \"Clap on all sail! d'ye hear? Stu'n-sails and sky-scrapers! Kape\r\nher steady! Hooray!\"\r\n\r\nIt was well for Barney that he had seized the saddle. Even as it was he\r\nreceived a tremendous blow from the horse's head as it took the leap,\r\nand was thrown back on its haunches when it cleared the ditch, which it\r\ndid nobly.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! old boy, not hurt, I hope,\" said Martin, suppressing his laughter\r\nas his comrade scrambled on to the saddle. \"You travel about on the back\r\nof your horse at full gallop like a circus rider.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whist, darlint, I do belave he has damaged my faygurhead. What a nose\r\nI've got! Sure I can see it mesilf without squintin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have, Barney. It's a little swelled, but never mind. We must all\r\nlearn by experience, you know. So come along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hould on, ye spalpeen, till I git my wind!\"\r\n\r\nBut Martin was off again at full speed; and Barney's horse, scorning to\r\nbe left behind, took the bit again in its teeth and went--as he himself\r\nexpressed it,--\"screamin' before the wind.\"\r\n\r\nA new sensation is not always and necessarily an agreeable thing. Martin\r\nand Barney found it so on the evening of that same day, as they reclined\r\n(they could not sit) by the side of their fire on the campo under the\r\nshelter of one of the small trees which grew here and there at wide\r\nintervals on the plain. They had left the diamond mine early that\r\nmorning, and their first day on horseback proved to them that there are\r\nshadows as well as lights in equestrian life. Their only baggage was a\r\nsingle change of apparel and a small bag of diamonds,--the latter being\r\nthe product of the mine during the Baron Fagoni's reign, and which that\r\nworthy was conveying faithfully to his employer. During the first part of\r\nthe day they had ridden through a hilly and woody country, and towards\r\nevening they emerged upon one of the smaller campos, which occur here and\r\nthere in the district.\r\n\r\n\"Martin,\" said Barney, as he lay smoking his pipe, \"'tis a pity that\r\nthere's no pleasure in this world without _something_ cross-grained\r\ninto it. My own feelin's is as if I had been lately passed through a\r\nstamping machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong, Barney, as usual,\" said Martin, who was busily engaged concluding\r\nsupper with an orange. \"If we had pleasures without discomforts we\r\nwouldn't half enjoy them. We need lights and shadows in life--what are\r\nyou grinning at, Barney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nothin', only ye're a remarkable philosopher, when ye're in\r\nthe vein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tis always in vain to talk philosophy to you, Barney, so good-night t'\r\nye. Oh, dear me, I wish I could sit down! but there's no\r\nalternative,--either bolt upright or quite flat.\"\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour they both forgot pleasures and sorrows alike in\r\nsleep. Next day the sun rose on the edge of the campo as it does out of\r\nthe ocean, streaming across its grassy billows, and tipping the ridges as\r\nwith ruddy gold. At first Martin and Barney did not enjoy the lovely\r\nscene, for they felt stiff and sore; but after half an hour's ride they\r\nbegan to recover; and when the sun rose in all its glory on the wide\r\nplain, the feelings of joyous bounding freedom that such scenes always\r\nengender obtained the mastery, and they coursed along in silent delight.\r\n\r\nThe campo was hard, composed chiefly of a stiff red clay soil and covered\r\nwith short grass in most places; but here and there were rank bushes of\r\nlong hairy grasses, around and amongst which grew a multitude of the most\r\nexquisitely beautiful flowerets and plants of elegant forms. Wherever\r\nthese flowers flourished very luxuriantly there were single trees of\r\nstunted growth and thick bark, which seldom rose above fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet. Besides these there were rich flowering myrtles, and here and there\r\na grotesque cactus or two.\r\n\r\nUnder one of these trees they reined up after a ride of two hours, and\r\npiqueting their horses, prepared breakfast. It was soon despatched, and\r\nthen remounting, away they went once more over the beautiful plains.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-day, as they were hasting towards the shelter of a grove which\r\nappeared opportunely on the horizon, Barney said suddenly,--\r\n\r\n\"Martin, lad, we're lost! We're out of our course, for sartin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking that for some time, Barney,\" replied Martin; \"but you\r\nhave your compass, and we can surely make the coast by dead\r\nreckoning--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, lad, we can; but it'll cost us a dale o' tackin' to make up for\r\nlee-way. Ah, good luck to ye! here's a friend 'll help us.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a herd of wild cattle dashed out of the grove and scampered\r\nover the plain, followed by a herdsman on horseback. Seeing that he was\r\nin eager pursuit of an animal which he wished to lasso, they followed him\r\nquietly and watched his movements. Whirling the noose round his head, he\r\nthrew it adroitly in such a manner that the bull put one of its legs\r\nwithin the coil. Then he reined up suddenly, and the animal was thrown on\r\nits back. At the same moment the lasso broke, and the bull recovered its\r\nfeet and continued its wild flight.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, friend,\" said Barney, galloping towards the disappointed\r\nherdsman and addressing him in Portuguese, \"could you show us the road to\r\nRio? We've lost it intirely.\"\r\n\r\nThe man pointed sulkily in the direction in which they were going, and,\r\nhaving mended his lasso, he wheeled about and galloped after the herd\r\nof cattle.\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to yer manners!\" said Barney, as he gazed after him. \"But what\r\ncan ye expect from the poor critter? He niver larned better Come along,\r\nMartin, we'll rest here a while.\"\r\n\r\nThey were soon under the shelter of the trees, and having fastened their\r\nhorses to one of them, they proceeded to search for water. While thus\r\nemployed, Barney shouted to his companion, \"Come here, lad; look here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone of the Irishman's voice that startled\r\nMartin, and he sprang hastily towards him. Barney was standing with his\r\narms crossed upon his chest and his head bowed forward, as he gazed with\r\na solemn expression on the figure of a man at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Is he ill?\" inquired Martin, stooping and lifting his hand. Starting\r\nback as he dropped it, he exclaimed, \"Dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, boy, he has gone to his last account. Look at him again, Martin. It\r\nwas he who came to the mine a week ago to buy a horse, and now--\" Barney\r\nsighed as he stooped and turned the body over in order to ascertain\r\nwhether he had been murdered; but there were no marks of violence to be\r\nseen. There was bread too in his wallet; so they could come to no other\r\nconclusion than that the unhappy man had been seized with fatal illness\r\nin the lonesome wood and died there.\r\n\r\nAs they searched his clothes they found a small leathern bag, which, to\r\ntheir amazement, was filled with gold-dust; and in the midst of the gold\r\nwas another smaller bag containing several small diamonds.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Martin, \"that explains his hurry. No doubt he had made\r\noff with these, and was anxious to avoid pursuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" said Barney. \"Well, thief or no thief, we must give the\r\npoor cratur' dacent burial. There's not a scrap o' paper to tell who he\r\nis or where he came from,--a sure sign that he wasn't what he should ha'\r\nbeen. Ah! Martin, what will we not do for the sake o' money! and, after\r\nall, we can't keep it long. May the Almighty niver let you or me set our\r\nhearts on it.\"\r\n\r\nThey dug a shallow grave with their hands in a sandy spot where the soil\r\nwas loose, in which they deposited the body of the unfortunate man; and\r\nthen remounting their horses, rode away and left him in his lonely\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nFor many days did Martin and Barney travel through the land on horseback,\r\nnow galloping over open campos, anon threading their way through the\r\nforest, and sometimes toiling slowly up the mountain sides. The aspect of\r\nthe country varied continually as they advanced, and the feelings of\r\nexcessive hilarity with which they commenced the journey began to subside\r\nas they became accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nOne evening they were toiling slowly up a steep range of hills which had\r\nbeen the prospect in front of them the whole of that day. As they neared\r\nthe summit of the range Martin halted at a stream to drink, and Barney\r\nadvanced alone. Suddenly Martin was startled by a loud cry, and looking\r\nup he saw Barney on his knees with his hands clasped before him! Rushing\r\nup the hill, Martin found his comrade with his face flushed and the tears\r\ncoursing down his cheeks as he stared before him!\r\n\r\n\"Look at it, Martin, dear!\" he cried, starting up and flinging his cap in\r\nthe air, and shouting like a madman. \"The say! my own native illiment!\r\nthe beautiful ocean! Och, darlint, my blessing on ye! Little did I think\r\nto see you more,--hooray!\"\r\n\r\nBarney sang and danced till he sank down on the grass exhausted; and, to\r\nsay truth, Martin felt much difficulty in restraining himself from doing\r\nlikewise, for before him was spread out the bright ocean, gleaming in the\r\nlight of the sinking sun, and calm and placid as a mirror. It was indeed\r\na glorious sight to these two sailors, who had not seen the sea for\r\nnearly two years. It was like coming suddenly face to face--after a long\r\nabsence--with an old and much loved friend.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible, the sea, however, was still a long way off from the\r\nSerra dos Orgos on which they stood. But their steeds were good, and it\r\nwas not long ere they were both rolling like dolphins in the beautiful\r\nbay of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nHere Barney delivered up the gold and diamonds to his employer, who paid\r\nhim liberally for his services and entertained them both hospitably while\r\nthey remained in the city. The bag of gold and diamonds which had been\r\nfound on the body of the dead man they appropriated, as it was absolutely\r\nimpossible to discover the rightful owner. Barney's friend bought it of\r\nthem at full price; and when they embarked, soon after, on board a\r\nhomeward bound ship, each had four hundred pounds in his pocket!\r\n\r\nAs they sailed out of the noble harbour Martin sat on the poop gazing at\r\nthe receding shore while thick-coming memories crowded on his brain.\r\n\r\nHis imagination flew back to the day when he first landed on the coast\r\nand escaped with his friend Barney from the pirates,--to the hermit's\r\ncottage in the lonely valley, where he first made acquaintance with\r\nmonkeys, iguanas, jaguars, armadillos, and all the wonderful, beautiful,\r\nand curious birds, beasts, and reptiles, plants, trees, and flowers, that\r\nlive and flourish in that romantic country. Once more, in fancy, he was\r\nsailing up the mighty Amazon, shooting alligators on its banks, spearing\r\nfish in its waters, paddling through its curious gapo, and swinging in\r\nhis hammock under its luxuriant forests. Once again he was a prisoner\r\namong the wild Indians, and he started convulsively as he thought of the\r\nterrible leap over the precipice into the stream that flowed into the\r\nheart of the earth. Then he wandered in the lonely forest. Suddenly the\r\ndiamond mines were before him, and Barney's jovial voice rang in his\r\nears; and he replied to it with energy, for now he was bounding on a\r\nfiery steed over the grassy campos. With a deep sigh he awoke from his\r\nreverie to find himself surrounded by the great wide sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Jollyboy, Esquire, of the Old Hulk, sat on the top of a tall\r\nthree-legged stool in his own snug little office in the sea-port town of\r\nBilton, with his legs swinging to and fro; his socks displayed a\r\nconsiderable way above the tops of his gaiters; his hands thrust deep\r\ninto his breeches pockets; his spectacles high on his bald forehead, and\r\nhis eyes looking through the open letter that lay before him; through the\r\ndesk underneath it; through the plank floor, cellars and foundations of\r\nthe edifice; and through the entire world into the distant future beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Four thousand pair of socks,\" he murmured, pulling down his spectacles\r\nand consulting the open letter for the tenth time; \"four thousand pair of\r\nsocks, with the hitch, same as last bale, but a very little coarser in\r\nmaterial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four thousand pair! and who's to make them, I wonder. If poor Mrs.\r\nDorothy Grumbit were here--ah! well, she's gone, so it can't be helped.\r\nFour thousand!--dear me who _will_ make them. Do _you_ know?\"\r\n\r\nThis question was addressed to his youngest clerk, who sat on the\r\nopposite side of the desk staring at Mr. Jollyboy with that open\r\nimpudence of expression peculiar to young puppy-dogs whose masters are\r\nunusually indulgent.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I don't,\" said the clerk with a broad grin.\r\n\r\nBefore the perplexed merchant could come at any conclusion on this knotty\r\nsubject the door opened and Martin Rattler entered the room, followed by\r\nhis friend Barney O'Flannagan.\r\n\r\n\"You've come to the wrong room, friends,\" said Mr. Jollyboy with a\r\nbenignant smile. \"My principal clerk engages men and pays wages. His\r\noffice is just opposite; first door in the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to engage,\" said Martin; \"we wish to speak with you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, beg pardon!\" cried Mr. Jollyboy, leaping off the stool with\r\nsurprising agility for a man of his years. \"Come in this way. Pray be\r\nseated--Eh! ah, surely I've seen you before, my good fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, sir, that ye have. I've sailed aboard your ships many a time. My\r\nname's Barney O'Flannagan, at yer sarvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I recollect; and a good man you are, I've been told, Barney; but I\r\nhave lost sight of you for some years. Been on a long voyage, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not 'xactly; but I've been on a long cruise, an' no mistake, in\r\nthe woods o' Brazil. I wos wrecked on the coast there, in the _Firefly_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! to be sure. I remember. And your young messmate here, was he\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I was,\" said Martin, answering for himself; \"and I had once\r\nthe pleasure of your acquaintance. Perhaps if you look steadily in my\r\nface you may--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then! don't try to bamboozle him. He might as well look at a bit o'\r\nmahogany as at your faygurhead. Tell him at wance, Martin dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin?\" exclaimed the puzzled old gentleman, seizing the young sailor\r\nby the shoulders and gazing intently into his face. \"Martin! Martin!\r\nSurely not--yes! eh? Martin Rattler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay that am I, dear Mr. Jollyboy, safe and sound, and--\"\r\n\r\nMartin's speech was cut short in consequence of his being violently\r\nthrottled by Mr. Jollyboy, who flung his arms round his neck and\r\nstaggered recklessly about the office with him! This was the great point\r\nwhich Barney had expected; it was the climax to which he had been looking\r\nforward all the morning: and it did not come short of his anticipations;\r\nfor Mr. Jollyboy danced round Martin and embraced him for at least ten\r\nminutes, asking him at the same time a shower of questions which he gave\r\nhim no time to answer. In the excess of his delight Barney smote his\r\nthigh with his broad hand so forcibly that it burst upon the startled\r\nclerk like a pistol-shot, and caused him to spring off his stool!\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afeared, young un,\" said Barney, winking and poking the small\r\nclerk jocosely in the ribs with his thumb. \"Isn't it beautiful to see\r\nthem. Arrah, now! isn't it purty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your thumbs to yourself, you sea monster,\" said the small clerk,\r\nangrily, and laying his hand on the ruler. But Barney minded him not, and\r\ncontinued to smite his thigh and rub his hands, while he performed a sort\r\nof gigantic war-dance round Mr. Jollyboy and Martin.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the old gentleman subsided sufficiently to understand\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\"But, my aunt,\" said Martin, anxiously; \"you have said nothing about Aunt\r\nDorothy. How is she? where is she? is she well?\"\r\n\r\nTo these questions Mr. Jollyboy returned no answer, but sitting suddenly\r\ndown on a chair, he covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\"She is not ill?\" inquired Martin in a husky voice, while his heart beat\r\nviolently. \"Speak, Mr. Jollyboy, is she--is she--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she's not ill,\" returned the old gentleman; \"but she's--\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dead!\" said Martin, in a tone so deep and sorrowful that the old\r\ngentleman started up.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not dead, my dear boy; I did not mean that. Forgive my\r\nstupidity, Martin. Aunt Dorothy is gone,--left the village a year ago;\r\nand I have never seen or heard of her since.\"\r\n\r\nTerrible though this news was, Martin felt a slight degree of relief to\r\nknow that she was not dead;--at least there was reason to hope that she\r\nmight be still alive.\r\n\r\n\"But when did she go? and why? and where?\"\r\n\r\n\"She went about twelve months ago,\" replied Mr. Jollyboy. \"You see,\r\nMartin, after she lost you she seemed to lose all hope and all spirit;\r\nand at last she gave up making socks for me, and did little but moan in\r\nher seat in the window and look out towards the sea. So I got a pleasant\r\nyoung girl to take care of her; and she did not want for any of the\r\ncomforts of life. One day the little girl came to me here, having run all\r\nthe way from the village, to say that Mrs. Grumbit had packed up a bundle\r\nof clothes and gone off to Liverpool by the coach. She took the\r\nopportunity of the girl's absence on some errand to escape; and we should\r\nnever have known it, had not some boys of the village seen her get into\r\nthe coach and tell the guard that she was going to make inquiries after\r\nMartin. I instantly set out for Liverpool; but long before I arrived the\r\ncoach had discharged its passengers, and the coachman, not suspecting\r\nthat anything was wrong, had taken no notice of her after arriving. From\r\nthat day to this I have not ceased to advertise and make all possible\r\ninquiries, but without success.\"\r\n\r\nMartin heard the narrative in silence, and when it was finished he sat a\r\nfew minutes gazing vacantly before him, like one in a dream. Then\r\nstarting up suddenly, he wrung Mr. Jollyboy's hand, \"Good-bye, my dear\r\nfriend; good-bye. I shall go to Liverpool. We shall meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, Martin, stay--\"\r\n\r\nBut Martin had rushed from the room, followed by his faithful friend, and\r\nin less than half an hour they were in the village of Ashford. The coach\r\nwas to pass in twenty minutes, so, bidding Barney engage two outside\r\nseats, he hastened round by the road towards the cottage. There it stood,\r\nquaint, time-worn, and old-fashioned, as when he had last seen it,--the\r\nlittle garden in which he had so often played,--the bower in which, on\r\nfine weather, Aunt Dorothy used to sit, and the door-step on which the\r\nwhite kitten used to gambol. But the shutters were closed, and the door\r\nwas locked, and there was an air of desolation and a deep silence\r\nbrooding over the place, that sank more poignantly into Martin's heart\r\nthan if he had come and found every vestige of the home of his childhood\r\nswept away. It was like the body without the soul. The flowers, and\r\nstones, and well-known forms were there; but she who had given animation\r\nto the whole was gone. Sitting down on the door-step, Martin buried his\r\nface in his hands and wept.\r\n\r\nHe was quickly aroused by the bugle of the approaching coach. Springing\r\nup, he dashed the tears away and hurried towards the high-road. In a few\r\nminutes Barney and he were seated on the top of the coach, and dashing,\r\nat the rate of ten miles an hour, along the road to Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD GARRET\r\n\r\n\r\nDays, and weeks, and months, passed away, and Martin had searched every\r\nnook and corner of the great sea-port without discovering his old aunt,\r\nor obtaining the slightest information regarding her. At first he and\r\nBarney went about the search together, but after a time he sent his old\r\ncompanion forcibly away to visit his own relatives, who dwelt not far\r\nfrom Bilton, at the same time promising that if he had any good news to\r\ntell he would immediately write and let him know.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as Martin was sitting beside the little fire in his lodging,\r\na tap came to the door, and the servant girl told him that a policeman\r\nwished to see him.\r\n\r\n\"Show him in,\" said Martin, who was not in the least surprised, for he\r\nhad had much intercourse with these guardians of the public peace during\r\nthe course of his unavailing search.\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir,\" said the man on entering, \"that we've got scent of an old\r\nwoman w'ich is as like the one that you're arter as hanythink.\"\r\n\r\nMartin rose in haste. \"Have you, my man? Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bout as sure as a man can be who never seed her. But it won't take you\r\nlong to walk. You'd better come and see for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nWithout uttering another word, Martin put on his hat and followed the\r\npoliceman. They passed through several streets and lanes, and at length\r\ncame to one of the poorest districts of the city, not far distant from\r\nthe shipping. Turning down a narrow alley, and crossing a low\r\ndirty-looking court, Martin's guide stopped before a door, which he\r\npushed open and mounted by a flight of rickety wooden stairs to a garret.\r\nHe opened the door and entered.\r\n\r\n\"There she is,\" said the man in a tone of pity, as he pointed to a corner\r\nof the apartment, \"an' I'm afeer'd she's goin' fast.\"\r\n\r\nMartin stepped towards a low truckle-bed on which lay the emaciated form\r\nof a woman covered with a scanty and ragged quilt. The corner of it was\r\ndrawn across her face, and so gentle was her breathing that it seemed as\r\nif she were already dead. Martin removed the covering, and one glance at\r\nthat gentle, care-worn countenance sufficed to convince him that his old\r\naunt lay before him! His first impulse was to seize her in his strong\r\narms, but another look at the frail and attenuated form caused him to\r\nshrink back in fear.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me,\" he said, rising hastily and slipping half a sovereign into\r\nthe policeman's hand; \"this is she. I wish to be alone with her.\"\r\n\r\nThe man touched his hat and retired, closing the door behind him; while\r\nMartin, sitting down on the bed, took one of his aunt's thin hands in\r\nhis. The action was tenderly performed, but it awoke her. For the first\r\ntime it flashed across Martin's mind that the sudden joy at seeing him\r\nmight be too much for one so feeble as Aunt Dorothy seemed to be. He\r\nturned his back hastily to the light, and with a violent effort\r\nsuppressed his feelings while he asked how she did.\r\n\r\n\"Well, very well,\" said Aunt Dorothy, in a faint voice. \"Are you the\r\nmissionary that was here long ago? Oh! I've been longing for you. Why did\r\nyou not come to read to me oftener about Jesus? But I have had Him here\r\nalthough you did not come. He has been saying 'Come unto me, ye that\r\nlabour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Yes, I have found\r\nrest in Him.\" She ceased and seemed to fall asleep again; but in a few\r\nseconds she opened her eyes and said, \"Martin, too, has been to see me;\r\nbut he does not come so often now. The darling boy used always to come to\r\nme in my dreams. But he never brings me food. Why does no one ever bring\r\nme food? I am hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you like food now, if I brought it to you?\" said Martin in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; bring me food,--I am dying.\"\r\n\r\nMartin released her hand and glided gently out of the room. In a few\r\nminutes he returned with a can of warm soup and a roll; of which Aunt\r\nDorothy partook with an avidity that showed she had been in urgent need.\r\nImmediately after, she went to sleep; and Martin sat upon the bed holding\r\nher hand in both of his till she awoke, which she did in an hour after,\r\nand again ate a little food. While she was thus engaged the door opened\r\nand a young man entered, who stated that he was a doctor, and had been\r\nsent there by a policeman.\r\n\r\n\"There is no hope,\" he said in a whisper, after feeling her pulse; \"the\r\nsystem is quite exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" whispered Martin, seizing the young man by the arm, \"can\r\nnothing save her? I have money, and can command _anything_ that may do\r\nher good.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. \"You may give her a little wine. It will\r\nstrengthen her for a time, but I fear there is no hope. I will send in a\r\nbottle if you wish it.\"\r\n\r\nMartin gave him the requisite sum, and in a few minutes the wine was\r\nbrought up by a boy.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the wine was wonderful. Aunt Dorothy's eyes sparkled as\r\nthey used to do in days of old, and she spoke with unwonted energy.\r\n\r\n\"You are kind to me, young man,\" she said, looking earnestly into\r\nMartin's face, which, however, he kept carefully in shadow. \"May our Lord\r\nreward you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to talk to you of your nephew?\" said Martin; \"I have\r\nseen him abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen my boy! Is he not dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he is alive, and in this country, too.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Dorothy turned pale, but did not reply for a few minutes, during\r\nwhich she grasped his hand convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"Turn your face to the light,\" she said faintly.\r\n\r\nMartin obeyed, and bending over her whispered, \"He is here; I am Martin,\r\nmy dear, dear aunt--\"\r\n\r\nNo expression of surprise escaped from Aunt Dorothy as she folded her\r\narms round his neck and pressed his head upon her bosom. His hot tears\r\nfell upon her neck while she held him, but she spoke not. It was evident\r\nthat as the strength infused by the wine abated her faculties became\r\nconfused. At length she whispered,--\r\n\r\n\"It is good of you to come to see me, darling boy. You have often come to\r\nme in my dreams. But do not leave me so soon; stay a very little longer,\"\r\n\r\n\"This is no dream, dearest aunt,\" whispered Martin, while his tears\r\nflowed faster; \"I am really here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, so you always say, my darling child; but you always go away and\r\nleave me. This is a dream, no doubt, like all the rest; but oh, it seems\r\nvery very real! You never _wept_ before, although you often smiled.\r\nSurely this is the best and brightest dream I ever had!\"\r\n\r\nContinuing to murmur his name while she clasped him tightly to her bosom,\r\nAunt Dorothy gently fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Dorothy Grumbit did _not_ die! Her gentle spirit had nearly fled;\r\nbut Martin's return and Martin's tender nursing brought her round, and\r\nshe gradually regained all her former strength and vigour. Yes, to the\r\nunutterable joy of Martin, to the inexpressible delight of Mr. Arthur\r\nJollyboy and Barney, and to the surprise and complete discomfiture of the\r\nyoung doctor who shook his head and said \"There is no hope,\" Aunt Dorothy\r\nGrumbit recovered? and was brought back in health and in triumph to her\r\nold cottage at Ashford!\r\n\r\nMoreover, she was arrayed again in the old bed-curtain chintz with the\r\nflowers as big as saucers, and the old high-crowned cap. A white kitten\r\nwas got, too, so like the one that used to be Martin's playmate, that no\r\none could discover a hair of difference. So remarkable was this, that\r\nMartin made inquiry, and found that it was actually the grand-daughter of\r\nthe old kitten, which was still alive and well; so he brought it back\r\ntoo, and formally installed it in the cottage along with its grandchild.\r\n\r\nThere was a great house-warming on the night of the day in which Aunt\r\nDorothy Grumbit was brought back. Mr. Arthur Jollyboy was there--of\r\ncourse; and the vicar was there; and the pursy doctor who used to call\r\nMartin \"a scamp;\" and the school-master; and last, though not least,\r\nBarney O'Flannagan was there. And they all had tea, during which dear\r\nAunt Dorothy smiled sweetly on everybody and said nothing,--and, indeed,\r\ndid nothing, except that once or twice she put additional sugar and cream\r\ninto Martin's cup when he was not looking, and stroked one of his hands\r\ncontinually. After tea Martin related his adventures in Brazil, and\r\nBarney helped him; and these two talked more that night than any one\r\ncould have believed it possible for human beings to do, without the aid\r\nof steam lungs! And the doctor listened, and the vicar and school-master\r\nquestioned, and old Mr. Jollyboy roared and laughed till he became purple\r\nin the face--particularly at the sallies of Barney. As for old Aunt\r\nDorothy Grumbit, she listened when Martin spoke. When Martin was silent\r\nshe became stone deaf!\r\n\r\nIn the course of time Mr. Jollyboy made Martin his head clerk; and then,\r\nbecoming impatient, he made him his partner off-hand. Then he made Barney\r\nO'Flannagan an overseer in the warehouses; and when the duties of the day\r\nwere over, the versatile Irishman became his confidential servant, and\r\nwent to sup and sleep at the Old Hulk; which, he used to remark, was\r\nquite a natural and proper and decidedly comfortable place to come to an\r\nanchor in.\r\n\r\nMartin became the stay and comfort of his aunt in her old age; and the\r\njoy which he was the means of giving to her heart was like a deep and\r\nplacid river which never ceases to flow. Ah! there is a rich blessing in\r\nstore for those who tenderly nurse and comfort the aged, when called upon\r\nto do so; and assuredly there is a sharp thorn prepared for those who\r\nneglect this sacred duty. Martin read the Bible to her night and morning;\r\nand she did nothing but watch for him at the window while he was out. As\r\nMartin afterwards became an active member of the benevolent societies\r\nwith which his partner was connected, he learned from sweet experience\r\nthat \"it is more blessed to give than to receive,\" and that \"it is\r\n_better_ to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of\r\nfeasting.\" Dear young reader, do not imagine that we plead in favour of\r\nmoroseness or gloom. Laugh if you will, and feast if you will, and\r\nremember, too, that \"a merry heart is a continual feast;\" but we pray you\r\nnot to forget that God himself has said that a visit to the house of\r\nmourning is _better_ than a visit to the house of feasting: and, strange\r\nto say, it is productive of greater joy; for to do good is better than to\r\nget good, as surely as sympathy is better than selfishness.\r\n\r\nMartin visited the poor and read the Bible to them; and in watering\r\nothers he was himself watered, for he found the \"Pearl of Great Price,\"\r\neven Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world.\r\n\r\nBusiness prospered in the hands of Martin Rattler, too, and he became a\r\nman of substance. Naturally, too, he became a man of great importance in\r\nthe town of Bilton. The quantity of work that Martin and Mr. Jollyboy and\r\nBarney used to get through was quite marvellous; and the number of\r\nengagements they had during the course of a day was quite bewildering.\r\n\r\nIn the existence of all men, who are not born to unmitigated misery,\r\nthere are times and seasons of peculiar enjoyment. The happiest hour of\r\nall the twenty-four to Martin Rattler was the hour of seven in the\r\nevening; for then it was that he found himself seated before the blazing\r\nfire in the parlour of the Old Hulk, to which Aunt Dorothy Grumbit had\r\nconsented to be removed, and in which she _was_ now a fixture. Then it\r\nwas that old Mr. Jollyboy beamed with benevolence, until the old lady\r\nsometimes thought the fire was going to melt him; then it was that the\r\ntea-kettle sang on the hob like a canary; and then it was that Barney\r\nbustled about the room preparing the evening meal, and talking all the\r\ntime with the most perfect freedom to any one who chose to listen to him.\r\nYes, seven p.m. was Martin's great hour, and Aunt Dorothy's great hour,\r\nand old Mr. Jollyboy's great hour, and Barney's too; for each knew that\r\nthe labours of the day were done, and that the front door was locked for\r\nthe night, and that a great talk was brewing. They had a tremendous talk\r\nevery night, sometimes on one subject, sometimes on another; but the\r\nsubject of all others that they talked oftenest about was their travels.\r\nAnd many a time and oft, when the winter storms howled round the Old\r\nHulk, Barney was invited to draw in his chair, and Martin and he plunged\r\nagain vigorously into the great old forests of South America, and spoke\r\nso feelingly about them that Aunt Dorothy and Mr. Jollyboy almost fancied\r\nthemselves transported into the midst of tropical scenes, and felt as if\r\nthey were surrounded by parrots, and monkeys, and jaguars, and\r\nalligators, and anacondas, and all the wonderful birds, beasts, reptiles,\r\nand fishes, that inhabit the woods and waters of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Martin Rattler, by Robert Michael Ballantyne",
